On 22 September 1989, a fire took place at Taufiqiah Al-Khairiah [[madrasa]] (also known as Madrasah Pondok Pak Ya) in [[Guar Chempedak]], [[Kedah]], [[Malaysia]]. Around 27 students who are mostly girls were killed in the incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.themalaysianinsight.com/bahasa/s/14668/|title=A fire stoked by silence|author=Chan Kok Leong|publisher=The Malaysian Insight|date=14 September 2017|accessdate=17 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/religious-school-fire-in-kuala-lumpur-by-no-means-the-first|title=Religious school fire in Kuala Lumpur by no means the first|publisher=The Straits Times|date=15 September 2017|accessdate=17 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; All victims bodies later were buried in a special Muslim cemetery at Padang Lumat as the "''27 Syuhada Peristiwa Kebakaran Pondok Pak Ya''" (27 Martyrs of the Taufiqiah Al-Khairiah madrasa fire).&lt;ref name="cause of the fire"/&gt;

'''''Acacia concinna''''' is a climbing shrub native to [[Asia]], common in the warm plains of [[central India|central and south India]].&lt;ref name="ildis"/&gt;  The tree is food for the [[larva]]e of the [[butterfly]] ''[[Pantoporia hordonia]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.funet.fi/pub/sci/bio/life/insecta/lepidoptera/ditrysia/papilionoidea/nymphalidae/limenitidinae/pantoporia/index.html#hordonia |title=Pantoporia |publisher=www.funet.fi |accessdate=2008-03-13 |last= |first= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alkaloids]] are found in the tree's fruit.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/tandf/uito/2005/00000024/A00300s3/art00004;jsessionid=1mthntz7qx0er.alice?format=print&amp;token=00421c32c8731039dfe86b64276a687b76504c48766a252c3a6e2f4240346f35ce www.ingentaconnect.com]   {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071002005859/http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/tandf/uito/2005/00000024/A00300s3/art00004%3Bjsessionid%3D1mthntz7qx0er.alice?format=print&amp;token=00421c32c8731039dfe86b64276a687b76504c48766a252c3a6e2f4240346f35ce |date=October 2, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==

===Shikakai===
''Acacia concinna'' has been used traditionally for hair care in the [[Indian Subcontinent]] since ancient times. It is one of the [[Ayurvedic]] [[medicinal plant]]s. It is traditionally used as a [[shampoo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flowersofindia.net/catalog/slides/Shikakai.html|title=Acacia concinna - Shikakai|author=|date=|website=www.flowersofindia.net|accessdate=8 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to prepare it the fruit pods, leaves and bark of the plant are dried, ground into a powder, then made into a paste.  While this traditional shampoo does not produce the normal amount of [[foam|lather]] that a sulfate-containing shampoo would, it is considered a good cleanser. It is mild, having a naturally low [[pH]], and doesn't strip hair of natural [[oil]]s. Usually no [[Hair conditioner|conditioner]] is needed, for shikakai also acts as a detangler.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.organicconsumers.org/bodycare/natural_bodycare_ingredients.cfm|title=Natural bodycare|author=|date=|website=organicconsumers.org|accessdate=8 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
An infusion of the leaves has been used in anti-[[dandruff]] preparations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.beautystylr.com/shikakai-benefits-for-hair-and-how-to-use|title=Shikakai for Hair: 16 Benefits and 11 Ways to Use it|author=|date=2017-04-29|website=beautystylr.com|accessdate=8 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''A. concinna'' extracts are used in natural shampoos or hair powders and the tree is now grown commercially in India and Far East Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://agritech.tnau.ac.in/forestry/forestry_nursery_acacia_concinna.html|title=Forestry :: Nursery Technologies|author=|date=|website=agritech.tnau.ac.in|accessdate=8 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plant parts used for the dry powder or the extract are the bark, leaves or pods. The bark contains high levels of [[saponin]]s, which are foaming agents found in several other plant species used as shampoos or soaps. Saponin-containing plants have a long history of use as mild cleaning agents. Saponins from the plant's pods have been traditionally used as a [[detergent]], and in [[Bengal]] for poisoning fish; they are documented to be potent marine toxins.

An infusion of the leaves of ''A. concinna'' has also been used for therapy of [[jaundice]] in the traditional Indian medicine.&lt;ref&gt;Tewari D, Mocan A, Parvanov ED, Sah AN, Nabavi SM, Huminiecki L, Ma ZF, Lee YY, Horbańczuk JO, Atanasov AG. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28860989 Ethnopharmacological Approaches for Therapy of Jaundice: Part I]. Front Pharmacol. 2017 Aug 15;8:518. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5559545/ doi: 10.3389/fphar.2017.00518].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other uses===
[[File:Acacia concinna.jpg|right|thumb|Flowers]]
The leaves have an acidic taste and are used in [[chutney]]s.

==Chemical constituents==
In commercial extracts, when the plant is [[hydrolysis|hydrolyzed]] it yields [[lupeol]], [[spinasterol]], [[acacic acid]], [[lactone]], and the natural sugars [[glucose]], [[arabinose]] and [[rhamnose]]. It also contains [[hexacosanol]], [[spinasterone]], [[oxalic acid]], [[tartaric acid]], [[citric acid]], [[succinic acid]], [[ascorbic acid]], and the [[alkaloid]]s [[calyctomine]] and [[nicotine]].

&lt;!-- Definition and symptoms --&gt;
'''Atherosclerosis''' is a disease in which the inside of an [[artery]] narrows due to the build up of [[atheroma|plaque]].&lt;ref name=NIH2016Def&gt;{{cite web|title=What Is Atherosclerosis? - NHLBI, NIH|url=https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/atherosclerosis|website=www.nhlbi.nih.gov|access-date=6 November 2017|language=en|date=22 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, there are generally no symptoms.&lt;ref name=NIH2016Sym&gt;{{cite web|title=What Are the Signs and Symptoms of Atherosclerosis? - NHLBI, NIH|url=https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/atherosclerosis/signs|website=www.nhlbi.nih.gov|access-date=5 November 2017|language=en|date=22 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; When severe, it can result in [[coronary artery disease]], [[stroke]], [[peripheral artery disease]], or [[kidney problems]], depending on which arteries are affected.&lt;ref name=NIH2016Sym/&gt; Symptoms, if they occur, generally do not begin until middle age.&lt;ref name=NIH2016Risk/&gt;

&lt;!-- Cause and diagnosis --&gt;
The exact cause is not known.&lt;ref name=NIH2016Sym/&gt; Risk factors include [[dyslipidemia|abnormal cholesterol levels]], [[high blood pressure]], [[diabetes]], [[smoking]], [[obesity]], family history, and an unhealthy diet.&lt;ref name=NIH2016Risk&gt;{{cite web | title = Who Is at Risk for Atherosclerosis?  | url = https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/atherosclerosis/atrisk |website=www.nhlbi.nih.gov|access-date=5 November 2017|language=en|date=22 June 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Plaque is made up of fat, [[cholesterol]], [[calcium]], and other substances found in the [[blood]].&lt;ref name=NIH2016Def/&gt; The narrowing of arteries limits the flow of oxygen-rich blood to parts of the body.&lt;ref name=NIH2016Def/&gt; Diagnosis is based upon a physical exam, [[electrocardiogram]], and [[exercise stress test]], among others.&lt;ref name=NIH2016Diag&gt;{{cite web|title=How Is Atherosclerosis Diagnosed? - NHLBI, NIH|url=https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/atherosclerosis/diagnosis|website=www.nhlbi.nih.gov|access-date=6 November 2017|language=en|date=22 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{TOC limit|3}}

== Definitions ==
The following terms are similar, yet distinct, in both spelling and meaning, and can be easily confused: [[arteriosclerosis]], [[arteriolosclerosis]], and atherosclerosis.  ''Arteriosclerosis'' is a general term describing any hardening (and loss of elasticity) of medium or large arteries ({{ety|gre|''ἀρτηρία'' (artēria)|artery||''σκλήρωσις'' ([[wikt:sclerosis|sklerosis]])|hardening}}); ''arteriolosclerosis'' is any hardening (and loss of elasticity) of [[arteriole]]s (small arteries); ''atherosclerosis'' is a hardening of an artery specifically due to an atheromatous plaque ({{ety|grc| ''ἀθήρα'' (athḗra)|gruel}}). The term ''atherogenic'' is used for substances or processes that cause formation of [[atheroma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Atherogenic | url = https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/atherogenic | work = Merriam-Webster Dictionary }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Signs and symptoms==
Atherosclerosis is asymptomatic for decades because the arteries enlarge at all plaque locations, thus there is no effect on blood flow.&lt;ref name="Ross1993"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ross R | title = The pathogenesis of atherosclerosis: a perspective for the 1990s | journal = Nature | volume = 362 | issue = 6423 | pages = 801–9 | date = April 1993 | pmid = 8479518 | doi = 10.1038/362801a0 | bibcode = 1993Natur.362..801R }}&lt;/ref&gt; Even most [[vulnerable plaque|plaque ruptures]] do not produce symptoms until enough narrowing or closure of an artery, due to clots, occurs. Signs and symptoms only occur after severe narrowing or closure impedes blood flow to different organs enough to induce symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;Atherosclerosis. Harvard Health Publications Harvard Health Publications. Health Topics A – Z, (2011)&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the time, patients realize that they have the disease only when they experience other cardiovascular disorders such as stroke or heart attack. These symptoms, however, still vary depending on which artery or organ is affected.&lt;ref name="nhlbi.nih.gov"&gt;{{cite web | title = Atherosclerosis | publisher = National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute | url = http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/atherosclerosis/signs.html | year = 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Typically, atherosclerosis begins in childhood, as a thin layer of white-yellowish streaks with the inner layers of the artery walls (an accumulation of white blood cells, mostly monocytes/macrophages) and progresses from there.

Clinically, given enlargement of the arteries for decades, symptomatic atherosclerosis is typically associated with men in their 40s and women in their 50s to 60s. Sub-clinically, the disease begins to appear in childhood, and rarely is already present at birth. Noticeable signs can begin developing at puberty. Though symptoms are rarely exhibited in children, early screening of children for cardiovascular diseases could be beneficial to both the child and his/her relatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = First signs of atherosclerotic heart disease may appear in early childhood | url = http://www.news-medical.net/news/20120201/First-signs-of-atherosclerotic-heart-disease-may-appear-in-early-childhood.aspx | work = News-Medical.net }}&lt;/ref&gt; While coronary artery disease is more prevalent in men than women, atherosclerosis of the cerebral arteries and strokes equally affect both sexes.&lt;ref name="pmid5697685"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Flora GC, Baker AB, Loewenson RB, Klassen AC | title = A comparative study of cerebral atherosclerosis in males and females | journal = Circulation | volume = 38 | issue = 5 | pages = 859–69 | date = November 1968 | pmid = 5697685 | doi = | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Stenosis|Marked narrowing]] in the coronary arteries, which are responsible for bringing oxygenated blood to the heart, can produce symptoms such as the chest pain of angina and shortness of breath, sweating, nausea, dizziness or light-headedness, breathlessness or palpitations.&lt;ref name="nhlbi.nih.gov"/&gt; Abnormal heart rhythms called arrhythmias—the heart beating either too slowly or too quickly—are another consequence of [[ischemia]].&lt;ref name="heartandstroke.com"&gt;Arrhythmia.

Carotid arteries supply blood to the brain and neck.&lt;ref name="heartandstroke.com"/&gt; Marked narrowing of the carotid arteries can present with symptoms such as a feeling of weakness, not being able to think straight, difficulty speaking, becoming dizzy and difficulty in walking or standing up straight, blurred vision, numbness of the face, arms, and legs, severe headache and losing consciousness. These symptoms are also related to stroke (death of brain cells). Stroke is caused by marked narrowing or closure of arteries going to the brain; lack of adequate blood supply leads to the death of the cells of the affected tissue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sims NR, Muyderman H | title = Mitochondria, oxidative metabolism and cell death in stroke | journal = Biochimica et Biophysica Acta | volume = 1802 | issue = 1 | pages = 80–91 | date = January 2010 | pmid = 19751827 | doi = 10.1016/j.bbadis.2009.09.003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Peripheral arteries, which supply blood to the legs, arms, and pelvis, also experience marked narrowing due to plaque rupture and clots. Symptoms for the marked narrowing are numbness within the arms or legs, as well as pain. Another significant location for the plaque formation is the renal arteries, which supply blood to the kidneys. Plaque occurrence and accumulation leads to decreased kidney blood flow and chronic kidney disease, which, like all other areas, are typically asymptomatic until late stages.&lt;ref name="nhlbi.nih.gov"/&gt;

According to United States data for 2004, in about 66% of men and 47% of women, the first symptom of atherosclerotic [[cardiovascular disease]] is a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] or [[sudden cardiac death]] (death within one hour of onset of the symptom).
[[Cardiac stress test]]ing, traditionally the most commonly performed non-invasive testing method for blood flow limitations, in general, detects only [[lumen (anatomy)|lumen]] narrowing of ≈75% or greater, although some physicians claim that nuclear stress methods can detect as little as 50%.

Case studies have included autopsies of U.S. soldiers killed in [[World War II]] and the [[Korean War]]. A much-cited report involved autopsies of 300 U.S. soldiers killed in Korea. Although the average age of the men was 22.1 years, 77.3 percent had "gross evidence of coronary arteriosclerosis".&lt;ref name=Enos&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Enos WF, Holmes RH, Beyer J |title= Coronary disease among United States soldiers killed in action in Korea: Preliminary Report |journal= JAMA |volume=152  |issue=12  |pages= 1090–93 |year=1953 |doi=10.1001/jama.1953.03690120006002}} The average age was calculated from the ages of 200 of the soldiers. No age was recorded in nearly 100 of the men.&lt;/ref&gt; Other studies done of soldiers in the [[Vietnam War]] showed similar results, although often worse than the ones from the earlier wars. Theories include high rates of [[tobacco use]] and (in the case of the Vietnam soldiers) the advent of processed foods after World War II.

The presence of the plaque induces the muscle cells of the blood vessel to stretch, compensating for the additional bulk, and the endothelial lining thickens, increasing the separation between the plaque and lumen. This somewhat offsets the narrowing caused by the growth of the plaque, but it causes the wall to stiffen and become less compliant to stretching with each heart beat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Aviram M, Fuhrman B | title = LDL oxidation by arterial wall macrophages depends on the oxidative status in the lipoprotein and in the cells: role of prooxidants vs. antioxidants | journal = Molecular and Cellular Biochemistry | volume = 188 | issue = 1-2 | pages = 149–59 | date = November 1998 | pmid = 9823020 | doi = 10.1023/A:1006841011201 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[American Heart Association]],  the [[American Diabetes Association]] and the [[National Cholesterol Education Program]] make similar recommendations. In contrast, Prof [[Walter Willett]] (Harvard School of Public Health, [[Principal investigator|PI]] of the second [[Nurses' Health Study]]) recommends much higher levels of fat, especially of [[Monounsaturated fat|monounsaturated]] and [[polyunsaturated fat]].&lt;ref name="titleFood Pyramids: Nutrition Source, Harvard School of Public Health"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/pyramids.html |title=Food Pyramids: Nutrition Source, Harvard School of Public Health |access-date=2007-11-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071226085222/http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/pyramids.html |archive-date=26 December 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; These dietary recommendations reach a consensus, though, against consumption of [[trans fat]]s.

The role of dietary oxidized fats/[[lipid peroxidation]] ([[rancidification|rancid fats]]) in humans is not clear.
Laboratory animals fed rancid fats develop atherosclerosis. Rats fed [[Docosahexaenoic acid|DHA]]-containing oils experienced marked disruptions to their [[antioxidant]] systems, and accumulated significant amounts of [[phospholipid]] [[hydroperoxide]] in their blood, livers and kidneys.&lt;ref name=SongJH&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Song JH, Fujimoto K, Miyazawa T | title = Polyunsaturated (n-3) fatty acids susceptible to peroxidation are increased in plasma and tissue lipids of rats fed docosahexaenoic acid-containing oils | journal = The Journal of Nutrition | volume = 130 | issue = 12 | pages = 3028–33 | date = December 2000 | pmid = 11110863 | doi = 10.1093/jn/130.12.3028 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mechanism ==&lt;!-- This section is linked [[Antioxidant]] --&gt;

Atherogenesis is the developmental process of atheromatous plaques. It is characterized by a remodeling of arteries leading to subendothelial accumulation of fatty substances called plaques. The buildup of an atheromatous plaque is a slow process, developed over a period of several years through a complex series of cellular events occurring within the arterial wall and in response to a variety of local vascular circulating factors. One recent hypothesis suggests that, for unknown reasons, [[leukocytes]], such as [[monocytes]] or [[basophils]], begin to attack the [[endothelium]] of the artery lumen in [[cardiac muscle]]. The ensuing [[inflammation]] leads to formation of atheromatous plaques in the arterial [[tunica intima]], a region of the vessel wall located between the [[endothelium]] and the [[tunica media]]. The bulk of these lesions is made of excess fat, [[collagen]], and [[elastin]]. At first, as the plaques grow, only [[intima-media thickness|wall thickening]] occurs without any narrowing. [[Stenosis]] is a late event, which may never occur and is often the result of repeated plaque rupture and healing responses, not just the atherosclerotic process by itself.

=== Cellular ===
[[File:RCA atherosclerosis.jpg|thumb|[[Micrograph]] of an [[right coronary artery|artery]] that supplies the [[heart]] showing significant atherosclerosis and marked [[lumen (anatomy)|luminal]] narrowing. Tissue has been stained using [[Masson's trichrome]].]]
Early atherogenesis is characterized by the adherence of blood circulating [[monocytes]] (a type of [[white blood cell]]) to the vascular bed lining, the [[endothelium]], then by their migration to the sub-endothelial space, and further activation into monocyte-derived [[macrophage]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Schwartz CJ, Valente AJ, Sprague EA, Kelley JL, Cayatte AJ, Mowery J | title = Atherosclerosis. Potential targets for stabilization and regression | journal = Circulation | volume = 86 | issue = 6 Suppl | pages = III117-23 | date = December 1992 | pmid = 1424045 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The primary documented driver of this process is oxidized lipoprotein particles within the wall, beneath the [[endothelium|endothelial]] cells, though upper normal or elevated concentrations of blood glucose also plays a major role and not all factors are fully understood. Fatty streaks may appear and disappear.

[[Low-density lipoprotein]] (LDL) particles in blood plasma invade the [[endothelium]] and become oxidized, creating risk of [[cardiovascular disease]]. A complex set of biochemical reactions regulates the oxidation of LDL, involving enzymes (such as [[Lp-LpA2]]) and [[free radical]]s in the endothelium.

Initial damage to the endothelium results in an inflammatory response. Monocytes enter the artery wall from the bloodstream, with [[platelet]]s adhering to the area of insult. This may be promoted by [[redox signaling]] induction of factors such as [[VCAM-1]], which recruit circulating monocytes, and [[M-CSF]], which is selectively required for the differentiation of monocytes to macrophages. The monocytes differentiate into [[macrophage]]s, which proliferate locally,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Robbins CS, Hilgendorf I, Weber GF, Theurl I, Iwamoto Y, Figueiredo JL, Gorbatov R, Sukhova GK, Gerhardt LM, Smyth D, Zavitz CC, Shikatani EA, Parsons M, van Rooijen N, Lin HY, Husain M, Libby P, Nahrendorf M, Weissleder R, Swirski FK | title = Local proliferation dominates lesional macrophage accumulation in atherosclerosis | journal = Nature Medicine | volume = 19 | issue = 9 | pages = 1166–72 | date = September 2013 | pmid = 23933982 | pmc = 3769444 | doi = 10.1038/nm.3258 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ingest oxidized LDL, slowly turning into large "[[foam cells]]" – so-called because of their changed appearance resulting from the numerous internal cytoplasmic [[vesicle (biology)|vesicles]] and resulting high [[lipid]] content. Under the microscope, the lesion now appears as a fatty streak. Foam cells eventually die and further propagate the inflammatory process.

In addition to these cellular activities, there is also smooth muscle proliferation and migration from the [[tunica media]] into the [[tunica intima|intima]] in response to [[cytokine]]s secreted by damaged endothelial cells. This causes the formation of a fibrous capsule covering the fatty streak. Intact endothelium can prevent this smooth muscle proliferation by releasing [[nitric oxide]].

===Calcification and lipids===
[[Calcification]] forms among [[vascular smooth muscle]] cells of the surrounding muscular layer, specifically in the muscle cells adjacent to atheromas and on the surface of atheroma plaques and tissue.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Miller JD | title = Cardiovascular calcification: Orbicular origins | journal = Nature Materials | volume = 12 | issue = 6 | pages = 476–8 | date = June 2013 | pmid = 23695741 | doi = 10.1038/nmat3663 | bibcode = 2013NatMa..12..476M }}&lt;/ref&gt; In time, as cells die, this leads to extracellular calcium deposits between the muscular wall and outer portion of the atheromatous plaques. With the atheromatous plaque interfering with the regulation of the calcium deposition, it accumulates and crystallizes.  A similar form of an intramural calcification, presenting the picture of an early phase of arteriosclerosis, appears to be induced by a number of drugs that have an antiproliferative mechanism of action ([[Rainer Liedtke]] 2008).

Cholesterol is delivered into the vessel wall by cholesterol-containing [[low-density lipoprotein]] (LDL) particles. To attract and stimulate macrophages, the cholesterol must be released from the LDL particles and oxidized, a key step in the ongoing inflammatory process. The process is worsened if there is insufficient [[high-density lipoprotein]] (HDL), the lipoprotein particle that removes cholesterol from tissues and carries it back to the liver.

The foam cells and platelets encourage the migration and proliferation of [[smooth muscle]] cells, which in turn ingest lipids, become replaced by collagen and transform into foam cells themselves. A protective fibrous cap normally forms between the fatty deposits and the artery lining (the [[endothelium|intima]]).

These capped fatty deposits (now called 'atheromas') produce enzymes that cause the artery to enlarge over time. As long as the artery enlarges sufficiently to compensate for the extra thickness of the atheroma, then no narrowing ("[[stenosis]]") of the opening ("lumen") occurs. The artery becomes expanded with an egg-shaped cross-section, still with a circular opening. If the enlargement is beyond proportion to the atheroma thickness, then an [[aneurysm]] is created.&lt;ref name=Glagov&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Glagov S, Weisenberg E, Zarins CK, Stankunavicius R, Kolettis GJ | title = Compensatory enlargement of human atherosclerotic coronary arteries | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 316 | issue = 22 | pages = 1371–5 | date = May 1987 | pmid = 3574413 | doi = 10.1056/NEJM198705283162204 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Visible features===
[[File:Atherosclerosis, aorta, gross pathology PHIL 846 lores.jpg|thumb|230px|Severe atherosclerosis of the [[aorta]]. [[Autopsy]] specimen.]]
Although arteries are not typically studied microscopically, two plaque types can be distinguished:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pathologyatlas.ro/coronary-atherosclerosis-fibrous-plaque.php |title=Coronary atherosclerosis — the fibrous plaque with calcification |publisher=www.pathologyatlas.ro |access-date=2010-03-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

# The fibro-lipid (fibro-fatty) plaque is characterized by an accumulation of lipid-laden cells underneath the intima of the arteries, typically without narrowing the lumen due to compensatory expansion of the bounding muscular layer of the artery wall. Beneath the endothelium there is a "fibrous cap" covering the atheromatous "core" of the plaque. The core consists of lipid-laden cells (macrophages and smooth muscle cells) with elevated tissue cholesterol and cholesterol ester content, fibrin, proteoglycans, collagen, elastin, and cellular debris.  In advanced plaques, the central core of the plaque usually contains extracellular cholesterol deposits (released from dead cells), which form areas of cholesterol crystals with empty, needle-like clefts. At the periphery of the plaque are younger "foamy" cells and capillaries. These plaques usually produce the most damage to the individual when they rupture. Cholesterol crystals may also play a role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Janoudi A, Shamoun FE, Kalavakunta JK, Abela GS | title = Cholesterol crystal induced arterial inflammation and destabilization of atherosclerotic plaque | journal = European Heart Journal | volume = 37 | issue = 25 | pages = 1959–67 | date = July 2016 | pmid = 26705388 | doi = 10.1093/eurheartj/ehv653 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
# The fibrous plaque is also localized under the intima, within the wall of the artery resulting in thickening and expansion of the wall and, sometimes, spotty localized narrowing of the lumen with some atrophy of the muscular layer. The fibrous plaque contains collagen fibers (eosinophilic), precipitates of calcium (hematoxylinophilic) and, rarely, lipid-laden cells.

In effect, the muscular portion of the artery wall forms small [[aneurysm]]s just large enough to hold the [[atheroma]] that are present. The muscular portion of artery walls usually remain strong, even after they have remodeled to compensate for the atheromatous plaques.

However, atheromas within the vessel wall are soft and fragile with little elasticity. Arteries constantly expand and contract with each heartbeat, i.e., the pulse. In addition, the calcification deposits between the outer portion of the atheroma and the muscular wall, as they progress, lead to a loss of elasticity and stiffening of the artery as a whole.

The calcification deposits,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book | last = Maton | first = Anthea | authorlink = |author2=Roshan L. Jean Hopkins |author3=Charles William McLaughlin |author4=Susan Johnson |author5=Maryanna Quon Warner |author6=David LaHart |author7=Jill D. Wright | title = Human Biology and Health | publisher = Prentice Hall | year = 1993 | location = Englewood Cliffs, NJ | isbn = 0-13-981176-1 | oclc = 32308337}}&lt;/ref&gt; after they have become sufficiently advanced, are partially visible on coronary artery [[computed tomography]] or [[electron beam tomography]] (EBT) as rings of increased radiographic density, forming halos around the outer edges of the atheromatous plaques, within the artery wall. On CT, &gt;130 units on the [[Hounsfield scale]] (some argue for 90 units) has been the radiographic density usually accepted as clearly representing tissue calcification within arteries. These deposits demonstrate unequivocal evidence of the disease, relatively advanced, even though the lumen of the artery is often still normal by angiography.

===Rupture and stenosis===
[[File:Late complications of atherosclerosis.PNG|thumb|upright=1.4|Progression of atherosclerosis to late complications.]]
Although the disease process tends to be slowly progressive over decades, it usually remains asymptomatic until an atheroma [[wikt:ulcer|ulcerates]], which leads to immediate blood clotting at the site of atheroma ulcer.  This triggers a cascade of events that leads to clot enlargement, which may quickly obstruct the flow of blood. A complete blockage leads to ischemia of the myocardial (heart) muscle and damage.  This process is the myocardial infarction or "heart attack".

If the heart attack is not fatal, fibrous organization of the clot within the lumen ensues, covering the rupture but also producing [[stenosis]] or closure of the lumen, or over time and after repeated ruptures, resulting in a persistent, usually localized stenosis or blockage of the artery lumen. Stenoses can be slowly progressive, whereas plaque ulceration is a sudden event that occurs specifically in atheromas with thinner/weaker fibrous caps that have become "unstable".

Repeated plaque ruptures, ones not resulting in total lumen closure, combined with the clot patch over the rupture and healing response to stabilize the clot is the process that produces most stenoses over time. The stenotic areas tend to become more stable despite increased flow velocities at these narrowings. Most major blood-flow-stopping events occur at large plaques, which, prior to their rupture, produced very little if any stenosis.

From clinical trials, 20% is the average stenosis at plaques that subsequently rupture with resulting complete artery closure. Most severe clinical events do not occur at plaques that produce high-grade stenosis. From clinical trials, only 14% of heart attacks occur from artery closure at plaques producing a 75% or greater stenosis prior to the vessel closing.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

If the fibrous cap separating a soft atheroma from the bloodstream within the artery ruptures, tissue fragments are exposed and released. These tissue fragments are very clot-promoting, containing [[collagen]] and [[tissue factor]]; they activate [[platelet]]s and activate the [[coagulation|system of coagulation]]. The result is the formation of a [[thrombus]] (blood clot) overlying the atheroma, which obstructs blood flow acutely. With the obstruction of blood flow, downstream tissues are starved of [[oxygen]] and nutrients. If this is the [[myocardium]] (heart muscle) [[Angina pectoris|angina]] (cardiac chest pain) or [[myocardial infarction]] (heart attack) develops.

===Accelerated growth of plaques===
The distribution of atherosclerotic plaques in a part of arterial endothelium is inhomogeneous. The multiple and focal development of atherosclerotic changes is similar to that in the development of amyloid plaques in the brain and that of age spots on the skin. Misrepair-accumulation aging theory suggests that misrepair mechanisms&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=  |bibcode=2009arXiv0904.0575W |title= Aging as a consequence of Misrepair –a novel theory of aging |last1=Wang |first1=Jicun |last2=Michelitsch |first2=Thomas  |last3=Wunderlin |first3=Arne  |last4=Mahadeva |first4=Ravi   | name-list-format = vanc  |issue= 0575 |volume=0904 |year=2009 |arxiv=0904.0575}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=  |bibcode=2015arXiv150307163W |title= Aging as a process of accumulation of Misrepairs |last1=Wang-Michelitsch |first1=Jicun |last2=Michelitsch |first2=Thomas | name-list-format = vanc  |issue= 07163 |volume=1503 |year=2015 |arxiv = 1503.07163 }}&lt;/ref&gt; play an important role in the focal development of atherosclerosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=  |bibcode=2015arXiv150501289W |title= Misrepair mechanism in the development of atherosclerotic plaques |last1=Wang-Michelitsch |first1=Jicun |last2=Michelitsch |first2=Thomas | name-list-format = vanc |issue= 01289  |volume=1505 |year=2015 |arxiv = 1505.01289 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Development of a plaque is a result of repair of injured endothelium. Because of the infusion of lipids into sub-endothelium, the repair has to end up with altered remodeling of local endothelium. This is the manifestation of a misrepair. Important is this altered remodeling makes the local endothelium have increased fragility to damage and have reduced repair-efficiency. As a consequence, this part of endothelium has increased risk to be injured and to be misrepaired. Thus, the accumulation of misrepairs of endothelium is focalized and self-accelerating. In this way, the growing of a plaque is also self-accelerating. Within a part of arterial wall, the oldest plaque is always the biggest, and is the most dangerous one to cause blockage of local artery.

===Components===
The plaque is divided into three distinct components:
# The [[atheroma]] ("lump of gruel", {{ety|gre|''ἀθήρα'' (athera)|[[gruel]]}}), which is the nodular accumulation of a soft, flaky, yellowish material at the center of large plaques, composed of macrophages nearest the [[lumen (anatomy)|lumen]] of the artery
# Underlying areas of cholesterol crystals
# Calcification at the outer base of older or more advanced [[lesions]]. Atherosclerotic lesions, or atherosclerotic plaques, are separated into two broad categories: Stable and unstable (also called vulnerable).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ross R | title = Atherosclerosis--an inflammatory disease | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 340 | issue = 2 | pages = 115–26 | date = January 1999 | pmid = 9887164 | doi = 10.1056/NEJM199901143400207 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The pathobiology of atherosclerotic lesions is very complicated, but generally, stable atherosclerotic plaques, which tend to be asymptomatic, are rich in [[extracellular matrix]] and [[smooth muscle cells]]. On the other hand, unstable plaques are rich in macrophages and [[foam cells]], and the extracellular matrix separating the lesion from the arterial lumen (also known as the [[fibrous cap]]) is usually weak and prone to rupture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Finn AV, Nakano M, Narula J, Kolodgie FD, Virmani R | title = Concept of vulnerable/unstable plaque | journal = Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology | volume = 30 | issue = 7 | pages = 1282–92 | date = July 2010 | pmid = 20554950 | doi = 10.1161/ATVBAHA.108.179739 | url = http://atvb.ahajournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=20554950 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ruptures of the fibrous cap expose thrombogenic material, such as [[collagen]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Didangelos A, Simper D, Monaco C, Mayr M | title = Proteomics of acute coronary syndromes | journal = Current Atherosclerosis Reports | volume = 11 | issue = 3 | pages = 188–95 | date = May 2009 | pmid = 19361350 | doi = 10.1007/s11883-009-0030-x | url = http://www.springerlink.com/content/8qjl665766630k8p/fulltext.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; to the circulation and eventually induce [[thrombus]] formation in the lumen. Upon formation, intraluminal thrombi can occlude arteries outright (e.g., coronary occlusion), but more often they detach, move into the circulation, and eventually occlude smaller downstream branches causing [[thromboembolism]].

Apart from thromboembolism, chronically expanding atherosclerotic lesions can cause complete closure of the lumen. Chronically expanding lesions are often asymptomatic until lumen [[stenosis]] is so severe (usually over 80%) that blood supply to downstream tissue(s) is insufficient, resulting in [[ischemia]]. These complications of advanced atherosclerosis are chronic, slowly progressive and cumulative. Most commonly, soft plaque suddenly ruptures (see [[vulnerable plaque]]), causing the formation of a thrombus that will rapidly slow or stop blood flow, leading to death of the tissues fed by the artery in approximately five minutes. This event is called an [[infarction]].

==Diagnosis==
[[File:Calcificatio atherosclerotica.jpg|thumb|Microphotography of arterial wall with calcified (violet color) atherosclerotic plaque ([[hematoxylin]] and [[eosin]] stain)]]
Areas of severe narrowing, [[stenosis]], detectable by [[angiography]], and to a lesser extent "[[Cardiac stress test|stress testing]]" have long been the focus of human diagnostic techniques for [[cardiovascular disease]], in general. However, these methods focus on detecting only severe narrowing, not the underlying atherosclerosis disease.  As demonstrated by human clinical studies, most severe events occur in locations with heavy plaque, yet little or no lumen narrowing present before debilitating events suddenly occur. Plaque rupture can lead to artery lumen occlusion within seconds to minutes, and potential permanent debility and sometimes sudden death.

Plaques that have ruptured are called complicated plaques.  The [[extracellular matrix]] of the lesion breaks, usually at the shoulder of the fibrous cap that separates the lesion from the arterial lumen, where the exposed thrombogenic components of the plaque, mainly [[collagen]] will trigger [[thrombus]] formation.  The thrombus then travels downstream to other blood vessels, where the blood clot may partially or completely block blood flow. If the blood flow is completely blocked, cell deaths occur due to the lack of [[oxygen]] supply to nearby cells, resulting in [[necrosis]]. The narrowing or obstruction of blood flow can occur in any artery within the body. Obstruction of arteries supplying the heart muscle results in a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]], while the obstruction of arteries supplying the brain results in an ischaemic [[stroke]].

[[File:RICA Stenosis 174302500.jpg|thumb|300px|Doppler ultrasound of right internal Carotid artery with calcified and non-calcified plaques showing less than 70% stenosis]]
Lumen stenosis that is greater than 75% was considered the hallmark of clinically significant disease in the past because recurring episodes of [[Angina pectoris|angina]] and abnormalities in [[Cardiac stress test|stress tests]] are only detectable at that particular severity of stenosis.
However, clinical trials have shown that only about 14% of clinically debilitating events occur at sites with more than 75% stenosis. The majority of cardiovascular events that involve sudden rupture of the atheroma plaque do not display any evident narrowing of the lumen.
Thus, greater attention has been focused on "vulnerable plaque" from the late 1990s onwards.&lt;ref name=MaseriFuster&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Maseri A, Fuster V | title = Is there a vulnerable plaque? | journal = Circulation | volume = 107 | issue = 16 | pages = 2068–71 | date = April 2003 | pmid = 12719286 | doi = 10.1161/01.CIR.0000070585.48035.D1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides the traditional diagnostic methods such as angiography and stress-testing, other detection techniques have been developed in the past decades for earlier detection of atherosclerotic disease. Some of the detection approaches include anatomical detection and physiologic measurement.

Examples of anatomical detection methods include coronary calcium scoring by CT, carotid IMT ([[Intima-media thickness|intimal media thickness]]) measurement by ultrasound, and [[intravascular ultrasound]] (IVUS).  Examples of physiologic measurement methods include lipoprotein subclass analysis, [[Glycosylated hemoglobin|HbA1c]], [[C-reactive protein|hs-CRP]], and [[homocysteine]].
Both anatomic and physiologic methods allow early detection before symptoms show up, disease staging and tracking of disease progression. Anatomic methods are more expensive and some of them are invasive in nature, such as IVUS. On the other hand, physiologic methods are often less expensive and safer. But they do not quantify the current state of the disease or directly track progression. In recent years, developments in nuclear imaging techniques such as PET and SPECT have provided ways of estimating the severity of atherosclerotic plaques.

==Prevention==
Up to 90% of cardiovascular disease may be preventable if established risk factors are avoided.&lt;ref name="McGillMcMahan2008"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = McGill HC, McMahan CA, Gidding SS | title = Preventing heart disease in the 21st century: implications of the Pathobiological Determinants of Atherosclerosis in Youth (PDAY) study | journal = Circulation | volume = 117 | issue = 9 | pages = 1216–27 | date = March 2008 | pmid = 18316498 | doi = 10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.107.717033 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = McNeal CJ, Dajani T, Wilson D, Cassidy-Bushrow AE, Dickerson JB, Ory M | title = Hypercholesterolemia in youth: opportunities and obstacles to prevent premature atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease | journal = Current Atherosclerosis Reports | volume = 12 | issue = 1 | pages = 20–8 | date = January 2010 | pmid = 20425267 | doi = 10.1007/s11883-009-0072-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Medical management of atherosclerosis first involves modification to risk factors–for example, via smoking cessation and diet restrictions.  Prevention then is generally by eating a healthy diet, exercising, not smoking, and maintaining a normal weight.&lt;ref name=NIH2016Pre/&gt;

===Diet===
Changes in diet may help prevent the development of atherosclerosis. Tentative evidence suggests that a diet containing dairy products has no effect on or decreases the risk of [[cardiovascular disease]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rice BH | title = Dairy and Cardiovascular Disease: A Review of Recent Observational Research | journal = Current Nutrition Reports | volume = 3 | pages = 130–138 | date = 2014 | pmid = 24818071 | pmc = 4006120 | doi = 10.1007/s13668-014-0076-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kratz M, Baars T, Guyenet S | title = The relationship between high-fat dairy consumption and obesity, cardiovascular, and metabolic disease | journal = European Journal of Nutrition | volume = 52 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–24 | date = February 2013 | pmid = 22810464 | doi = 10.1007/s00394-012-0418-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A diet high in fruits and vegetables decreases the risk of cardiovascular disease and death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wang X, Ouyang Y, Liu J, Zhu M, Zhao G, Bao W, Hu FB | title = Fruit and vegetable consumption and mortality from all causes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer: systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies | journal = BMJ | volume = 349 | pages = g4490 | date = July 2014 | pmid = 25073782 | pmc = 4115152 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.g4490 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence suggests that the [[Mediterranean diet]] may improve cardiovascular results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Walker C, Reamy BV | title = Diets for cardiovascular disease prevention: what is the evidence? | journal = American Family Physician | volume = 79 | issue = 7 | pages = 571–8 | date = April 2009 | pmid = 19378874 | doi =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also evidence that a Mediterranean diet may be better than a [[low-fat diet]] in bringing about long-term changes to cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., lower [[cholesterol level]] and [[blood pressure]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nordmann AJ, Suter-Zimmermann K, Bucher HC, Shai I, Tuttle KR, Estruch R, Briel M | title = Meta-analysis comparing Mediterranean to low-fat diets for modification of cardiovascular risk factors | journal = The American Journal of Medicine | volume = 124 | issue = 9 | pages = 841–51.e2 | date = September 2011 | pmid = 21854893 | doi = 10.1016/j.amjmed.2011.04.024 | url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/featuredreviews/mediterraneandiet-2012/%20%20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exercise===
A controlled exercise program combats atherosclerosis by improving circulation and functionality of the vessels. Exercise is also used to manage weight in patients who are obese, lower blood pressure, and decrease cholesterol. Often lifestyle modification is combined with medication therapy. For example, statins help to lower cholesterol, antiplatelet medications like [[aspirin]] help to prevent clots, and a variety of antihypertensive medications are routinely used to control blood pressure.  If the combined efforts of risk factor modification and medication therapy are not sufficient to control symptoms, or fight imminent threats of ischemic events, a physician may resort to interventional or surgical procedures to correct the obstruction.&lt;ref&gt;"Unit 6: Cardiovascular, Circulatory, and Hematologic Function."

Textbook.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment==
Treatment of established disease may include medications to lower cholesterol such as [[statin]]s, [[blood pressure medication]], or medications that decrease clotting, such as [[aspirin]].&lt;ref name=NIH2016Tx/&gt; A number of procedures may also be carried out such as [[percutaneous coronary intervention]], [[coronary artery bypass graft]], or [[carotid endarterectomy]].&lt;ref name=NIH2016Tx/&gt;

Medical treatments often focus on alleviating symptoms. However measures which focus on decreasing underlying atherosclerosis—as opposed to simply treating symptoms—are more effective.&lt;ref name="Fonarow, G 2003"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fonarow G | year = 2003 | title = Aggressive treatment of atherosclerosis: The time is now | url = | journal = Cleve. Clin. J. Med. | volume = 70 | issue = | pages = 431–434 | doi=10.3949/ccjm.70.5.431}}&lt;/ref&gt; Non-pharmaceutical means are usually the first method of treatment, such as stopping smoking and practicing regular exercise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ambrose JA, Barua RS | title = The pathophysiology of cigarette smoking and cardiovascular disease: an update | journal = Journal of the American College of Cardiology | volume = 43 | issue = 10 | pages = 1731–7 | date = May 2004 | pmid = 15145091 | doi = 10.1016/j.jacc.2003.12.047 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pigozzi F | year = 2011 | title = Endothelial (dys)function: the target of physical exercise for prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease | url = | journal = J. Sports Med. Phys. Fitness | volume = 51 | issue = | pages = 260–267 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; If these methods do not work, medicines are usually the next step in treating cardiovascular diseases and, with improvements, have increasingly become the most effective method over the long term.

The key to the more effective approaches is to combine multiple different treatment strategies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Koh KK, Han SH, Oh PC, Shin EK, Quon MJ | title = Combination therapy for treatment or prevention of atherosclerosis: focus on the lipid-RAAS interaction | journal = Atherosclerosis | volume = 209 | issue = 2 | pages = 307–13 | date = April 2010 | pmid = 19800624 | pmc = 2962413 | doi = 10.1016/j.atherosclerosis.2009.09.007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, for those approaches, such as lipoprotein transport behaviors, which have been shown to produce the most success, adopting more aggressive combination treatment strategies taken on a daily basis and indefinitely has generally produced better results, both before and especially after people are symptomatic.&lt;ref name="Fonarow, G 2003"/&gt;

===Statins===
The group of medications referred to as [[statin]]s are widely prescribed for treating atherosclerosis. They have shown benefit in reducing cardiovascular disease and mortality in those with [[high cholesterol]] with few side effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Taylor F, Huffman MD, Macedo AF, Moore TH, Burke M, Davey Smith G, Ward K, Ebrahim S | title = Statins for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 1 | issue = 1 | pages = CD004816 | date = January 2013 | pmid = 23440795 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD004816.pub5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These data are primarily in middle-age men and the conclusions are less clear for women and people over the age of 70.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Vos E, Rose CP | title = Questioning the benefits of statins | journal = CMAJ | volume = 173 | issue = 10 | pages = 1207; author reply 1210 | date = November 2005 | pmid = 16275976 | pmc = 1277053 | doi = 10.1503/cmaj.1050120 | url = http://www.cmaj.ca/cgi/content/full/173/10/1207-a }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Surgery===
When atherosclerosis has become severe and caused irreversible [[ischemia]], such as [[tissue loss]] in the case of [[peripheral artery disease]], surgery may be indicated. [[Vascular bypass|Vascular bypass surgery]] can re-establish flow around the diseased segment of artery, and [[angioplasty]] with or without [[stent]]ing can reopen narrowed arteries and improve bloodflow. Coronary artery bypass grafting without manipulation of the ascending aorta has demonstrated reduced rates of postoperative stroke and mortality compared to traditional on-pump coronary revascularization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zhao DF, Edelman JJ, Seco M, Bannon PG, Wilson MK, Byrom MJ, Thourani V, Lamy A, Taggart DP, Puskas JD, Vallely MP | title = Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting With and Without Manipulation of the Ascending Aorta: A Network Meta-Analysis | journal = Journal of the American College of Cardiology | volume = 69 | issue = 8 | pages = 924–936 | date = February 2017 | pmid = 28231944 | doi = 10.1016/j.jacc.2016.11.071 | url = http://www.onlinejacc.org/content/69/8/924 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Prognosis ==
{{Expand section|date=December 2017}}
Diabetics, despite not having clinically detectable atherosclerotic disease, have more severe debility from atherosclerotic events over time than non-diabetics who have already had atherosclerotic events. Thus diabetes has been upgraded to be viewed as an advanced atherosclerotic disease equivalent.{{Clarify|date=December 2010}}

== Research ==
===Lipids===
An indication of the role of HDL on atherosclerosis has been with the rare Apo-A1 Milano human genetic variant of this HDL protein. A small short-term trial using bacterial synthetized human [[ApoA-1 Milano|Apo-A1 Milano]] HDL in people with unstable angina produced fairly dramatic reduction in measured coronary plaque volume in only six weeks vs. the usual increase in plaque volume in those randomized to placebo. The trial was published in ''JAMA'' in early 2006. {{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}  Ongoing work starting in the 1990s may lead to human clinical trials—probably by about 2008.{{update inline|date=June 2014}}  These may use synthesized Apo-A1 Milano HDL directly, or they may use gene-transfer methods to pass the ability to synthesize the Apo-A1 Milano HDLipoprotein. {{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}

Methods to increase [[high-density lipoprotein]] (HDL) particle concentrations, which in some animal studies largely reverses and remove atheromas, are being developed and researched. {{Citation needed|date=February 2018}} However, increasing HDL by any means is not necessarily helpful. For example, the drug [[torcetrapib]] is the most effective agent currently known for raising HDL (by up to 60%). However, in clinical trials it also raised deaths by 60%.  All studies regarding this drug were halted in December 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Barter PJ, Caulfield M, Eriksson M, Grundy SM, Kastelein JJ, Komajda M, Lopez-Sendon J, Mosca L, Tardif JC, Waters DD, Shear CL, Revkin JH, Buhr KA, Fisher MR, Tall AR, Brewer B | title = Effects of torcetrapib in patients at high risk for coronary events | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 357 | issue = 21 | pages = 2109–22 | date = November 2007 | pmid = 17984165 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMoa0706628 | url = http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/NEJMoa0706628 }}&lt;/ref&gt; See [[CETP inhibitor]] for similar approaches.

PUFAs are [[essential nutrients]] – they are involved in metabolism in that very form as they are consumed with food. In [[transgenic mice]], that are a model for human-like lipoprotein metabolism, adding D-PUFAs to diet indeed reduced body weight gain, improved cholesterol handling and reduced atherosclerotic damage to aorta.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Berbée JF, Mol IM, Milne GL, Pollock E, Hoeke G, Lütjohann D, Monaco C, Rensen PC, van der Ploeg LH, Shchepinov MS | title = Deuterium-reinforced polyunsaturated fatty acids protect against atherosclerosis by lowering lipid peroxidation and hypercholesterolemia | journal = Atherosclerosis | volume = 264 | pages = 100–107 | date = September 2017 | pmid = 28655430 | doi = 10.1016/j.atherosclerosis.2017.06.916 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tsikas D | title = Combating atherosclerosis with heavy PUFAs: Deuteron not proton is the first | journal = Atherosclerosis | volume = 264 | issue =  | pages = 79–82 | date = September 2017 | pmid = 28756876 | doi = 10.1016/j.atherosclerosis.2017.07.018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===miRNA===
[[MicroRNA]]s (miRNAs) have complementary sequences in the [[3' UTR]] and [[5' UTR]] of target mRNAs of protein-coding genes, and cause mRNA cleavage or repression of translational machinery. In diseased vascular vessels, miRNAs are dysregulated and highly expressed. [[miR-33]] is found in cardiovascular diseases.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chen WJ, Yin K, Zhao GJ, Fu YC, Tang CK | title = The magic and mystery of microRNA-27 in atherosclerosis | journal = Atherosclerosis | volume = 222 | issue = 2 | pages = 314–23 | date = June 2012 | pmid = 22307089 | doi = 10.1016/j.atherosclerosis.2012.01.020 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is involved in atherosclerotic initiation and progression including lipid metabolism, insulin signaling and glucose homeostatis, cell type progression and proliferation, and myeloid cell differentiation.

===DNA damage===
[[Aging]] is the most important risk factor for cardiovascular problems.  The causative basis by which aging mediates its impact, independently of other recognized risk factors, remains to be determined.  Evidence has been reviewed for a key role of [[DNA damage (naturally occurring)|DNA damage]] in vascular aging.&lt;ref name="pmid23953979"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wu H, Roks AJ | title = Genomic instability and vascular aging: a focus on nucleotide excision repair | journal = Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine | volume = 24 | issue = 2 | pages = 61–8 | date = February 2014 | pmid = 23953979 | doi = 10.1016/j.tcm.2013.06.005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid27213333"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bautista-Niño PK, Portilla-Fernandez E, Vaughan DE, Danser AH, Roks AJ | title = DNA Damage: A Main Determinant of Vascular Aging | journal = International Journal of Molecular Sciences | volume = 17 | issue = 5 | pages = 748 | date = May 2016 | pmid = 27213333 | pmc = 4881569 | doi = 10.3390/ijms17050748 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid28347738"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Shah AV, Bennett MR | title = DNA damage-dependent mechanisms of ageing and disease in the macro- and microvasculature | journal = European Journal of Pharmacology | volume = 816 | issue =  | pages = 116–128 | date = December 2017 | pmid = 28347738 | doi = 10.1016/j.ejphar.2017.03.050 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  
[[8-Oxoguanine|8-oxoG]], a common type of oxidative damage in [[DNA]], is found to accumulate in plaque [[vascular smooth muscle]] cells, [[macrophage]]s and [[endothelium|endothelial cells]],&lt;ref name="pmid12186795"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Martinet W, Knaapen MW, De Meyer GR, Herman AG, Kockx MM | title = Elevated levels of oxidative DNA damage and DNA repair enzymes in human atherosclerotic plaques | journal = Circulation | volume = 106 | issue = 8 | pages = 927–32 | date = August 2002 | pmid = 12186795 | doi = 10.1161/01.cir.0000026393.47805.21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; thus linking DNA damage to plaque formation.

WS patients develop a considerable burden of atherosclerotic plaques in their [[Coronary circulation|coronary arteries]] and [[aorta]]: calcification of the aortic valve is also frequently observed.&lt;ref name="pmid27213333" /&gt;  These findings link excessive unrepaired DNA damage to premature aging and early atherosclerotic plaque development (see [[DNA damage theory of aging]]).

===Microorganisms===
The [[human microbiota|microbiota]] – all the [[microorganism]]s in the body, can contribute to atherosclerosis in many ways: modulation of the [[immune system]], changes in [[metabolism]], processing of nutrients and production of certain metabolites that can get into blood circulation.&lt;ref name="nature.com"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Barrington WT, Lusis AJ | title = Atherosclerosis: Association between the gut microbiome and atherosclerosis | journal = Nature Reviews.

Its levels have been associated with atherosclerosis in human studies and animal research suggest that there can be a causal relation. An association between the bacterial genes encoding trimethylamine lyases — the [[enzyme]]s involved in TMAO generation — and atherosclerosis has been noted.&lt;ref name="pmid29018189"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jie Z, Xia H, Zhong SL, Feng Q, Li S, Liang S, Zhong H, Liu Z, Gao Y, Zhao H, Zhang D, Su Z, Fang Z, Lan Z, Li J, Xiao L, Li J, Li R, Li X, Li F, Ren H, Huang Y, Peng Y, Li G, Wen B, Dong B, Chen JY, Geng QS, Zhang ZW, Yang H, Wang J, Wang J, Zhang X, Madsen L, Brix S, Ning G, Xu X, Liu X, Hou Y, Jia H, He K, Kristiansen K | display-authors = 6 | title = The gut microbiome in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease | journal = Nature Communications | volume = 8 | issue = 1 | pages = 845 | date = October 2017 | pmid = 29018189 | pmc = 5635030 | doi = 10.1038/s41467-017-00900-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nature.com"/&gt;

[[File:Australia-Bali Memorial Eye Centre (10673752803).jpg|thumb|Doctors perform eye surgery on a patient at the clinic]]
The '''Bali Mandara Eye Hospital''' ({{lang-id|'''Rumah Sakit Mata Bali Mandara'''}}, until 2013 '''Australia Bali Memorial Eye Centre''' or '''ABMEC''') is an [[ophthalmology]] clinic and [[day surgery]] centre in [[Indonesia]], built in memory of the [[2002 Bali bombings]].

==History==
The construction of the Centre was part of the [[Australian Government]]'s [[Bali]] Recovery Package after the 2002 Bali bombings, and was achieved after a submission to the Australian Government from [[The John Fawcett Foundation]]. The $7 million project was commissioned by [[AusAID]], with a design team which included experts from [[Australia]] and Indonesia. It opened officially on 27 July 2007&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.balieye.org/news/NewsUpdate_Jun_Jul_07.pdf |format=pdf |title=ABMEC Opening |publisher=The John Fawcett Foundation |date=2007 |accessdate=12 November 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321000748/http://www.balieye.org/news/NewsUpdate_Jun_Jul_07.pdf |archivedate=21 March 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and began treating patients on 1 October 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.humanitarianprojectsindonesia.org/news/NewsUpdate_Oct_Dec_07.pdf |format=pdf |title=Australia Bali Memorial Eye Centre (ABMEC) |publisher=The John Fawcett Foundation |date=2007 |accessdate=12 November 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151112110614/http://www.humanitarianprojectsindonesia.org/news/NewsUpdate_Oct_Dec_07.pdf |archivedate=12 November 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Centre is owned and managed by the Bali Provincial Department of Health and operated in partnership with the John Fawcett Foundation and its Indonesian arm, the [[Yayasan Kemanusiaan Indonesia]].{{cn|date=November 2015}} The Australian Government handed over the ABMEC to the Indonesian Government on 13 October 2015,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indonesia.embassy.gov.au/jakt/MR13_041.html |title=Australia hands over Bali eye facility to Indonesian Government |date=13 October 2015 |accessdate=12 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; while renaming it  "Bali Mandara Eye Hospital".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Erviani |first=Ni Komang |url=http://www.thebalidaily.com/2013-12-16/australia-hands-over-bali-eye-facility.html |title=Australia hands over Bali eye facility |newspaper=The Bali Daily |date=16 December 2013 |accessdate=12 November 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151112110614/http://www.thebalidaily.com/2013-12-16/australia-hands-over-bali-eye-facility.html |archivedate=12 November 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Staff from the [[Lions Eye Institute]] in [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]], [[Western Australia]], were instrumental in setting up the Centre. The Institute's [[Nursing management#Director of Nursing|director of nursing]], [[Elizabeth Zambotti]], commissioned the facility after playing a key role in its development, while Institute director [[Professor Ian Constable]] oversaw training of Indonesian ophthalmologists by LEI staff.

In the first two days 160 Indonesian [[patients]] were seen and a dozen cataract operations were performed by Indonesian [[ophthalmologists]].

==Facilities==
The Centre has a training facility with digital imaging teaching capacity to enhance the surgical skills of young Indonesian and Australian graduate ophthalmologists, providing for academic exchange between Indonesian and Australian ophthalmologists and trainees. Theatres provide digital imaging from microscopic views of eye surgeries for capture, replay and analysis. The wet lab also has video imaging facilities for teaching.

It is planned to develop specialized clinics in the Centre for [[glaucoma]] and [[diabetic retinopathy]] which are on the increase in the Balinese community. The Centre also has [[optometry]] facilities with basic manufacturing and assembling capacity to cater for the almost 70 per cent of poor patients who benefit from remedial [[glasses]].

In the event of a [[natural disaster]] on Bali, the 2,500 sq m two-story building also has the potential to become a first-level trauma centre, as it has two theatres/three-table surgical capacity and high quality [[Sterilization (microbiology)|sterilization]], [[x-ray]] and [[ultrasound]] facilities.

Two mobile eye surgical units are attached to the Centre and cover remote areas on Bali. Each mobile clinic team with one ophthalmic surgeon, four [[nurses]] and two drivers can check over 18,000 people with eye problems per year and perform around 1,200 [[cataract]] operations.

'''Bedtime''' (also called '''putting to bed''' or '''tucking in''') is a ritual part of [[parenting]] to help [[children]] feel more secure&lt;ref name=scoresbyBedtime /&gt; and become accustomed to a more rigid schedule of sleep than they might prefer. The ritual of bedtime is aimed at facilitating the transition from wakefulness to sleep.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hale|first=Lauren|last2=Berger|first2=Lawrence M.|last3=LeBourgeois|first3=Monique K.|last4=Brooks-Gunn|first4=Jeanne|title=Social and Demographic Predictors of Preschoolersʼ Bedtime Routines|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1097/DBP.0b013e3181ba0e64|journal=Journal of Developmental &amp; Behavioral Pediatrics|volume=30|issue=5|pages=394–402|doi=10.1097/dbp.0b013e3181ba0e64|pmc=2793084}}&lt;/ref&gt; It may involve [[bedtime story|bedtime stories]], [[children's song]]s, [[nursery rhymes]], [[bed-making]] and getting children to change into [[nightwear]]. In some religious households, prayers are said shortly before going to bed.&lt;ref&gt;A Scottish prayer: "I am going now into the sleep, / Be it that I in health shall wake; / If death be to me in deathly sleep, / Be it that in thine own arm's keep, / O God of grace, to new life I wake; / O be it in thy dear arm's keep, / O God of grace, that I shall awake!" (from ''Poems of the Western Highlanders'', 1900; in ''The Oxford Book of Prayer'', general editor: George Appleton. Oxford University Press; no. 325 at p. 101&lt;/ref&gt;

In adult use, the term means simply "time for bed", similar to [[curfew]], as in "It's past my bedtime". Some people are accustomed to drinking a [[nightcap (beverage)|nightcap]] or [[herbal tea]] at bedtime.

==Synonyms==
{{Wiktionary|lights out}}
In [[boarding schools]] and on trips or [[holiday]]s that involve young people, the equivalent of bedtime is ''lights out'' or ''lights-out''; a term also used in prisons, hospitals, in the military, and in sleep research.

If a CMMI [[Pilot experiment|pilot]] model is considered successful, the [[United States Secretary of Health and Human Services|Secretary of Health and Human Services]] may expand its duration and scope. To be considered a successful test, a model must meet three criteria: 
# The Secretary determines that such expansion is expected to— (A) reduce spending under the applicable title without reducing the quality of care; or (B) improve the quality of patient care without increasing spending;
# The Chief Actuary of the [[Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services|Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services]] certifies that such expansion would reduce (or would not result in any increase in) net program spending under the applicable titles; and
# The Secretary determines that such expansion would not deny or limit the coverage or provision of benefits under the applicable title for applicable individuals.&lt;ref name="CMMI-Model-Certifications"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Research/ActuarialStudies/CMMI-Model-Certifications.html|title=CMMI-Model-Certifications|date=2017-11-01|website=www.cms.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2017-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Since its founding, CMMI has produced two models that have been certified for expansion based on meeting the above criteria: the Pioneer [[Accountable care organization|Accountable Care Organization]] (ACO) Model and the Medicare Diabetes Prevention Program.&lt;ref name="CMMI-Model-Certifications"/&gt;

'''Central Council of Homeopathy''' (CCH) is a [[Statutory corporation|statutory]] apex body under the [[Ministry of AYUSH]], Govt. of India. It was set up by the [[Government of India]] in 1973, and part of the [[University Grants Commission (India)#Professional councils|Professional Councils]] of [[University Grants Commission (India)|University Grants Commission]] (UGC), formed to monitor higher education in India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Professional Councils |url=http://www.ugc.ac.in/inside/pcouncil.html#CCH |date= |publisher=[[University Grants Commission (India)|University Grants Commission]] (UGC) website |page= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100106075646/http://www.ugc.ac.in/inside/pcouncil.html#CCH |archivedate=2010-01-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

CCH controls [[homeopathy]] education in India; any institution desiring to grant a qualification in homeopathy is required to apply to the Council, which prescribes course curriculum and maintains central registers of homeopaths.&lt;ref name=Ed/&gt;

==History==
The institution set up under the ''Central Council of Homeopathy Act 1973, (Act 59)''. Any university or similar institution in India offering either a degree or a diploma in [[homeopathy]] can do so only if it is approved by CCH, apart from being listed under the schedules of the above-mentioned act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Homeopathy not attractive among medical aspirants|url=http://www.hindu.com/2005/09/12/stories/2005091218710300.htm |publisher=[[The Hindu]] |date=September 12, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The CCH also defines particular course curriculum and notifies benchmarks that need to be maintained by homeopathy teaching institutions, apart from maintaining a central registry of all homeopathy physicians in India.&lt;ref name=Ed&gt;{{cite news |title= Education Plus: Homeopathy |url=http://www.hindu.com/edu/2005/03/22/stories/2005032200250300.htm |publisher=[[The Hindu]] |date=Mar 22, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, the [[Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (India)|Union Health Ministry]] set up the 'National Council for Clinical Establishments' for "determine minimum standards" for clinical establishments.A CCH representative is also a formal member of this National Council.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=National council for clinical establishments|url=http://www.hindu.com/2007/04/18/stories/2007041800710900.htm |publisher=[[The Hindu]] |date=Apr 18, 2007 |accessdate=14 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2016, the [[Central Bureau of Investigation]] (CBI) arrested the CCH's chief, Dr Ramjee Singh and another man in relation to the alleged collection of money to provide a favorable report that would allow regulatory approval.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/central-council-of-homeopathy-chief-dr-ramjee-singh-held-for-graft/story-PZ9nVLQxxZSIr0NTSSZR8L.html |title=Central Council of Homeopathy chief Dr Ramjee Singh held for graft |work=The Hindustan Times |date=23 October 2016 |accessdate=28 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bachelor of Homeopathic Medicine and Surgery==
{{main|Bachelor of Homeopathic Medicine and Surgery}}
The council regulates the Bachelor of Homeopathic Medicine and Surgery (B.H.M.S.). It is a graduate degree in [[Homeopathy]] awarded after the study of five and a half years, including one-year internship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=MANDHANI|first1=APOORVA|title=Gujarat HC Quashes Rules Permitting Common Counselling By State For Management Quota Seats In Ayurveda Colleges [Read Judgment]|url=http://www.livelaw.in/gujarat-hc-quashes-rules-permitting-common-counselling-state-management-quota-seats-ayurveda-colleges-read-judgment/|publisher=Live Law|date=August 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; BHMS covers medical knowledge of the homeopathic system.

== History ==
{{further|Osteopathic medicine in the United States#History}}

The practice of [[osteopathy]] began in the United States in 1874. The term "osteopathy" was coined by physician and surgeon&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cdm.sos.mo.gov/cdm4/document.php?CISOROOT=/atsu&amp;CISOPTR=693&amp;REC=1 |title='&amp;#39;Medical Registration for Macon County, MO as of March 27, 1874,'&amp;#39; Missouri Digital Heritage, Secretary of State of Missouri |accessdate=13 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cdm.sos.mo.gov/cdm4/item_viewer.php?CISOROOT=/atsu&amp;CISOPTR=759&amp;CISOBOX=1&amp;REC=2 |title=Medical registration for Adair County, MO dated 28 July 1883 |publisher=Missouri Digital Heritage, Secretary of State of Missouri}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Andrew Taylor Still]], who named his new discipline of medicine "osteopathy", reasoning that "the bone, ''osteon'', was the starting point from which [he] was to ascertain the cause of pathological conditions".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.meridianinstitute.com/eamt/files/webster1/webcont.html#HOW%20I%20CAME%20TO%20ORIGINATE%20OSTEOPATHY |title=Early American Manual Therapy |access-date=2013-10-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101205145639/http://meridianinstitute.com/eamt/files/webster1/webcont.html#HOW%20I%20CAME%20TO%20ORIGINATE%20OSTEOPATHY |archive-date=2010-12-05 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Still founded the American School of Osteopathy (now [[A.T. Still University]] of the Health Sciences) in [[Kirksville, Missouri|Kirksville]], Missouri, for the teaching of osteopathy on May 10, 1892. While the state of Missouri granted the right to award the MD degree,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nj.gov/highereducation/AGMEC/osteopathic_med_school_accreditation_standards.pdf |title=Commission on Osteopathic College Accreditation |publisher=State of New Jersey |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080908041004/http://www.nj.gov/highereducation/AGMEC/osteopathic_med_school_accreditation_standards.pdf |archivedate=2008-09-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; he remained dissatisfied with the limitations of conventional medicine and instead chose to retain the distinction of the DO degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://history.osteopathic.org/educate.shtml |title=Osteopathic Virtual Museum |accessdate=13 November 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316164329/http://history.osteopathic.org/educate.shtml |archivedate=16 March 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1898 the American Institute of Osteopathy started the ''[[Journal of Osteopathy]]'' and by that time four states recognized the profession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=General Notices|journal=Popular Science Monthly|date=Mar 1898|page=710|url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/20879097|accessdate=14 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The osteopathic medical profession has evolved into two branches: non-physician manual medicine [[osteopathy|osteopaths]], who were educated and trained outside the United States; and US-trained osteopathic physicians, who conduct a full scope of medical practice. The regulation of non-physician manual medicine osteopaths varies greatly between jurisdictions. In the United States, osteopathic physicians holding the DO degree have attained the same rights, privileges, and responsibilities as [[physicians]] with a [[Doctor of Medicine]] (MD) degree.&lt;ref name=Medline /&gt; Osteopathic physicians and non-physician osteopaths are so distinct that in practice they function as separate professions.

As originally conceived by Andrew Still, the letters "DO" stood for "Diplomate in Osteopathy" and the title conferred by the degree was "Doctor of Osteopathy".&lt;ref name="Booth2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Emmons Rutledge Booth|title=History of Osteopathy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Jg6jQzKegQQC&amp;pg=PA80|date=2006|isbn=978-3-936679-04-5|page=80}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, the degree also came to be entitled "Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine".&lt;ref name="DiGiovannaSchiowitz2005"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Eileen L.

A minority of DOs continue to use the old terms, and the [[American Academy of Osteopathy]] retains the old usage in its name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=21178160|date=2010|last1=Allen|first1=TW|title=Osteopathic medical terminology--redux|volume=110|issue=12|pages=743–4|journal=The Journal of the American Osteopathic Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demographics==
In 2015, there were 96,954 osteopathic [[physicians|medical doctors]] in the United States and 123,075 total DOs and osteopathic medical students.&lt;ref name="OMP2015"/&gt;  The proportion of females in the profession has steadily increased since the 1980s.&lt;ref name=OMP_2012 /&gt;  In 1985, about 10 percent of DO physicians were female, compared with 40 percent in 2015.&lt;ref name=OMP_2015&gt;{{cite web|title=Osteopathic Medicine Profession Report 2015|url=http://www.osteopathic.org/inside-aoa/about/aoa-annual-statistics/Documents/2015-OMP-report.pdf|publisher=American Osteopathic Association|access-date=2016-01-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160201133749/http://www.osteopathic.org/inside-aoa/about/aoa-annual-statistics/Documents/2015-OMP-report.pdf|archive-date=2016-02-01|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 2008 and 2012, 49 percent of new DO graduates were females.&lt;ref name=OMP_2012&gt;{{cite web|title=Osteopathic Medical Profession Report 2012|url=http://www.osteopathic.org/inside-aoa/about/aoa-annual-statistics/Documents/2012-OMP-report.pdf|publisher=American Osteopathic Association|access-date=2012-12-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130616054507/http://www.osteopathic.org/inside-aoa/about/aoa-annual-statistics/Documents/2012-OMP-report.pdf|archive-date=2013-06-16|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 2011-12 academic year, the osteopathic medical student body consisted of: 69 percent white/non-Hispanic, 19 percent Asian or Pacific Islander, 3.5 percent Hispanic, 3 percent African-American, and 0.5 percent Native American or Alaskan.&lt;ref name=OMP_2012 /&gt; The remainder were listed as "other or not entered". The five-year change in osteopathic medical student enrollment by ethnicity has increased by 19 percent for white/non-Hispanic students, 36 percent for Asian-American students, 24 percent for Black/African American students and 60 percent for Hispanic/Latino students.&lt;ref name=OMP_2015 /&gt;

==Education, training and distinctiveness ==
{{further|Osteopathic medicine in the United States|Osteopathic manipulative medicine}}
Osteopathic medical school curricula are virtually identical to those at schools granting the MD degree ([[Doctor of Medicine]]). Once admitted to an osteopathic medical school, students study for four years in order to graduate. The schooling is divided into the pre-clinical and clinical years. The pre-clinical years, the first and second years, focus on the biomedical and clinical sciences. The clinical years, the third and fourth years, consist of [[Clerkship (medicine)|core clinical training]] and [[sub-internship]]s in the clinical specialties. 

Osteopathic medical school accreditation standards require training in [[internal medicine]], [[Obstetrics and gynaecology|obstetrics/gynecology]], [[pediatrics]], [[family medicine]], [[surgery]], [[psychiatry]], [[emergency medicine]], [[radiology]], [[preventive medicine]], and [[public health]].&lt;ref name=curriculum&gt;{{cite web|title=Overview of Osteopathic Medical Education/Accreditation/The Four-Year Curriculum (2012 Osteopathic Medical College Information Book) |url=http://www.aacom.org/resources/bookstore/cib/Documents/2012cib/2012cib-p8.pdf |publisher=American Association of Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine|date=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine]], "the training, practice, credentialing, licensure, and reimbursement of osteopathic physicians is virtually indistinguishable from those of physicians with MD qualifications, with 4 years of osteopathic medical school followed by specialty and subspecialty training and [[board certification]]".&lt;ref name=Harrisons /&gt;

DO schools provide an additional 300–500 hours in the study of hands-on manual medicine and the body's musculoskeletal system, which is referred to as [[osteopathic manipulative medicine]] (OMM).&lt;ref name=Medline&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002020.htm |title=Doctor of Osteopathic medicine (D.O.) |author=MedLine Plus |date=2007 |work=National Institutes of Health |publisher=U.S. National Library of Medicine, National Institutes of Health |accessdate=June 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, osteopaths subscribed to the view that such body manipulation can bring about systemic healing&amp;nbsp;– a belief which is a form of pseudomedicine. In the early 21st century, American osteopathic physicians have largely shifted their thinking from such pre-scientific ideas.&lt;ref name=understanding&gt;{{cite book |author=Swanson ES |title=Science and Society: Understanding Scientific Methodology, Energy, Climate, and Sustainability |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tQmhCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA65 |year=2015 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-3-319-21987-5 |page=65 |chapter=Pseudoscience}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Osteopathic physicians who use OMM predominantly use it to treat musculoskeletal conditions, for which there is [[Osteopathic manipulative medicine#effectiveness|conflicting evidence]] about effectiveness.&lt;ref name="Franke2014"&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Franke H, Franke JD, Fryer G |title=Osteopathic manipulative treatment for nonspecific low back pain: a systematic review and meta-analysis |journal=BMC Musculoskelet Disord|volume=15|issue=1|pages=286|date=August 2014|pmid=25175885|pmc=4159549|doi=10.1186/1471-2474-15-286|type=Systematic review &amp; meta-analysis}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=chronic&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Orrock PJ, Myers SP |title=Osteopathic intervention in chronic non-specific low back pain: a systematic review |journal=BMC Musculoskelet Disord |volume=14 |issue= |pages=129 |year=2013 |pmid=23570655 |pmc=3623881 |doi=10.1186/1471-2474-14-129 |type=Systematic review}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Particular criticism has been targeted at [[craniosacral therapy]], a component of OMM taught at many DO schools, which has limited scientific support.&lt;ref name="pmid23131379"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jäkel A, von Hauenschild P |title=A systematic review to evaluate the clinical benefits of craniosacral therapy |journal=Complement Ther Med |volume=20 |issue=6 |pages=456–65 |year=2012 |pmid=23131379 |doi=10.1016/j.ctim.2012.07.009 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rev2012"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.2042-7166.2012.01174.x |title=Craniosacral therapy: A systematic review of the clinical evidence |year=2012 |author=Ernst E |journal=Focus on Alternative and Complementary Therapies |volume=17 |issue=4 |pages=197–201}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Examinations===
Before entering osteopathic medical school, an application must complete a four-year undergraduate degree and take a national standardized exam called the [[Medical College Admissions Test]] (MCAT). Some combined undergraduate/medical programs exist. Some authors note the differences in the average MCAT scores and [[grade point average]] of students who [[Matriculation|matriculate]] at DO schools compared to those who matriculate at MD schools within the United States. In 2015, the average MCAT and GPA for students entering US-based MD programs were 31.4 and 3.70, respectively,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Table 17: MCAT Scores and GPAs for Applicants and Matriculants to U.S. Medical Schools |url=https://www.aamc.org/download/161690/data/table17.pdf |publisher=Association of American Medical Colleges |date=2000–2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120614143734/https://www.aamc.org/download/161690/data/table17.pdf |archivedate=2012-06-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and 27.33 and 3.55 for DO matriculants,&lt;ref name=2011_MatriculantProfile&gt;{{cite web|title=AACOMAS Matriculant Profile 2011 Entering Class |url=http://www.aacom.org/docs/default-source/data-and-trends/2012-15-matprofilerpt.pdf?sfvrsn=8 |format=PDF |publisher=American Association of Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine |accessdate=14 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the gap has been getting smaller every year.&lt;ref name=2011_MatriculantProfile /&gt; DO medical schools are more likely to accept non-traditional students,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Osteopathic Medical College Information Book|url=http://www.aacom.org/resources/bookstore/cib/Documents/2012cib/2012cib-whole.pdf|publisher=American Association of Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine|date=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Madison Park |url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/HEALTH/06/13/mid.life.doctors/index.html?hpt=hp_t2/ |title=Never too late to be a doctor |publisher=CNN News |date=June 13, 2011 |accessdate=December 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; who are older and entering medicine as a second career, or coming from non-science majors.

DO medical students are required to take the Comprehensive Osteopathic Medical Licensure Examination ([[COMLEX-USA]]), which is sponsored by the [[National Board of Osteopathic Medical Examiners]] (NBOME). The COMLEX-USA is series of four osteopathic medical licensing examinations. The first three exams of the COMLEX-USA are taken during medical school and are prerequisites for osteopathic residency programs, which are available in almost every specialty of medicine and surgery. Level 2 consists of a multiple-choice portion and a patient evaluation exam (2PE). COMLEX-Level 2PE, is available only in [[Chicago]], IL and [[Philadelphia]], PA. It is graded as a Pass/Fail exam. Finally, COMLEX Level 3 is taken during the first year of residency.

In addition to the COMLEX-USA, DO medical students may choose to sit for the MD licensure examinations, which are called the [[United States Medical Licensing Examination]] (USMLE).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usmle.org/bulletin/eligibility/ |title=United States Medical Licensing Examination &amp;#124; USMLE Bulletin &amp;#124; Eligibility |publisher=Usmle.org |accessdate=2012-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is typically done if the student desires to enter an MD residency.

{{further|Comparison of MD and DO in the United States}}

== Licensing and board certification ==
To obtain a license to practice medicine in the United States, osteopathic medical students must pass the [[Comprehensive Osteopathic Medical Licensing Examination]] (COMLEX),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Board Examinations and Licensure|url=http://www.aacom.org/resources/bookstore/cib/Documents/2012cib/2012cib-p11.pdf|work=Medical College Information Book, 2012 edition|publisher=AACOM|accessdate=19 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; the licensure exam administered by the [[National Board of Osteopathic Medical Examiners]] throughout their medical training. Students are given the option of also taking the [[United States Medical Licensing Examination]] (USMLE) to apply for some [[Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education]] (ACGME) residency programs. Those that have received or are in the process of earning an MD or DO degree are both eligible to sit for the USMLE. Because of their additional training, only DO candidates are eligible to sit for the COMLEX.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=COMLEX-USA: Bulletin of Information|url=http://www.nbome.org/docs/comlexboi.pdf|archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20120916080523/http://www.nbome.org/docs/comlexBOI.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=16 September 2012|publisher=National Board of Osteopathic Medical Examiners|accessdate=19 November 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon completion of internship and residency requirements for their chosen medical specialty, and depending on whether the program attended as ACGME or AOA accredited, holders of the DO may elect to be board certified by either a specialty board (through the [[American Medical Association]]'s [[American Board of Medical Specialties]]) or an osteopathic specialty board (through the [[American Osteopathic Association Bureau of Osteopathic Specialists]] certifying boards). In February 2014, the [[American Osteopathic Association]] and the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education agreed to unify allopathic and osteopathic [[Graduate medical education]] starting in 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Allopathic and Osteopathic Medical Communities Commit to a Single Graduate Medical Education Accreditation System|url=https://www.acgme.org/acgmeweb/portals/0/PDFS/Nasca-Community/SingleAccreditationRelease2-26.pdf|publisher=Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education|accessdate=3 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Depending on the state, medical licensure may be issued from a combined board (DO and MD) or a separate board of medical examiners.&lt;ref name=DirectoryBoards&gt;{{cite web|title=Directory of State Medical and Osteopathic Boards|url=http://www.fsmb.org/directory_smb.html|publisher=Federation of State Medical Boards|accessdate=6 July 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120709175748/http://www.fsmb.org/directory_smb.html|archivedate=9 July 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; All of the 70 state medical boards are members of the [[Federation of State Medical Boards]].&lt;ref name=FSMB&gt;{{cite web|title=Federation of State Medical Boards|url=http://www.fsmb.org/index.html|publisher=Federation of State Medical Boards|accessdate=18 November 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121115063540/http://www.fsmb.org/index.html|archivedate=15 November 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== International variations ==
Currently, there are no osteopathic programs located outside of the United States that would qualify an individual to practice as an osteopathic physician in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aacom.org/about/osteomed/Pages/TheDifference.aspx |title=The Difference Between U.S.-Trained Osteopathic Physicians and Osteopaths Trained Abroad |date=2012 |publisher=American Association of Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine |accessdate=17 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Foreign osteopathic degrees are not recognized by any state in the US as being equivalent to American DO degrees.

[[Drug abuse]] is a major issue in [[Tanzania]]. In 2011, the drug control commission (which is dealing with drug abuse issues) reported that the number of people who are addicted ranges from 150,000 and 500,000. Most of the people who are involved in drug abuse in Tanzania are youths, who are often involved in trafficking and consuming illegal drugs like cannabis. The common illegal drugs in Tanzania are [[khat]], [[marijuana]], [[heroin]], [[cocaine]], and [[cannabis]].

==Background==

Illegal drugs are available in Tanzania due to the transmission of drugs across the country borders to the nearby countries like Zambia, Malawi, Burundi, and Rwanda. 
There was a time were some of the regions were cultivating drugs like [[cannabis]], some of those regions are Arusha, Tanga, and Mara. The government decided to destroy all the plantation and caught the people who were engaging in such activities of cultivating illegal drugs. The government established a Drug Control Commission to deal with prevention of drug abuse and trafficking. It also provides opportunities for Non-Governmental Organizations to help in preventing drug abuse in the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yusuph|first1=Kambuga|title=Adolescents and Drug Abuse in Tanzania: History and Evolution|date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==

The major cause of drug abuse in Tanzania is easy accessibility and availability of drug abuse among regions of the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Matowo|first1=Aisia|title=CAUSE, EFFECT AND REMEDIAL MEASURES OF DRUG ABUSE AMONG THE CHILDREN IN TANZANIA|date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment==

In Tanzania, there are numbers of sober house centers in different regions, which provide treatment and consultation to drug addicts. They receive a number of people who are addicted and live with them for a certain period of time, depends on how one is affected. On the other hand, the government (through the ministry of health, community, development, gender, elderly, and children) provides support to the hospitals and sober houses. For instance, Mwananyamala Hospital in [[Dar es Salaam]] also provides treatment for drug addicts and sometime uses [[methadone]] as a treatment for [[addiction]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1548">The '''European Pathway Association''' (E-P-A.org) is a [[Europe]]an [[non-profit]] organisation which brings together researchers, managers and clinicians on the management concept of [[Clinical Pathway|clinical pathways]]. The organisation works on the establishment of [[Clinical Pathway|clinical care pathways]] in order to systematically plan and follow up a patient focused [[Health care|care]] program.

==History==
In 2003, at the conference of the ''International Society for Quality in Healthcare'' (ISQUA) in [[Dallas]] (United States), the idea of a European Pathway Association was suggested by Kris Vanhaecht of the [[Katholieke Universiteit Leuven]] (Belgium) and Massimiliano Panella of the [[University of Eastern Piedmont]] (Italy). On 16 and 17 September 2004, the EPA was founded at a meeting in [[Jesi]] (Italy).

A '''forgiveness scale''' is a [[psychological test]] that attempts to measure a person's willingness to [[forgive]]. Examples include the Forgiveness scale of the [[Interpersonal Relationship Resolution Scale]];&lt;ref&gt;Hargrave, Terry D. The Development of a Forgiveness Scale. Journal of marital and family therapy. (01/1997),  23 (1), p. 41 - 62.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Marital Offence-Specific Forgiveness Scale]];&lt;ref&gt;Paleari, F. Giorgia Measuring offence-specific forgiveness in marriage: The Marital Offence-Specific Forgiveness Scale (MOFS).. Psychological assessment. (2009),  21 (2), p. 194 - 209.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Workplace Forgiveness Scale]];&lt;ref&gt;Watkins, Itsara A Psychometric Analysis of the Workplace Forgiveness Scale. Europe's journal of psychology. (05/2013),  9 (2), p. 319 - 338&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Tendency to Forgive scale]].&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Ryan P. Letting bygones be bygones: further evidence for the validity of the Tendency to Forgive scale. Personality and individual differences. (02/2005),  38 (3), p. 627 - 638&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies have found that compared to participants without past [[suicide attempt]]s, those with past suicide attempts scored on the Forgiveness Scale as being significantly less believing of forgiveness by others, were less likely to forgive themselves, and to a lesser degree, were less forgiving of others.&lt;ref&gt;Sansone, Randy A. The relationship between forgiveness and history of suicide attempt. Mental health, religion &amp; culture. (01/2013),  16 (1), p. 31 - 37&lt;/ref&gt;

Once fully commissioned, it will be the third largest hydroelectric plant in Africa with a power output of about 1870 Megawatt (MW), thus more than doubling total installed capacity in Ethiopia from its 2007 level of 814 MW.&lt;ref name="Gibe"&gt;Ethiopian Electric Power Corporation:[http://www.gibe3.com.et/ Gibe III Hydroelectric Project Official Website], accessed on May 7, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Energy Information Administration]]:[http://tonto.eia.doe.gov/country/country_energy_data.cfm?fips=ET   Ethiopia Energy Profile], accessed on October 27, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The Gibe III dam is part of the Gibe cascade, a series of dams including the existing [[Gilgel Gibe I Power Station|Gibe I]] dam (184 MW) and [[Gilgel Gibe II Power Station|Gibe II]] power station (420 MW) as well as the planned Gibe IV (1472 MW) and Gibe V (560 MW) dams. The existing dams are owned and operated by the state-owned [[Ethiopian Electric Power]], which is also the client for the Gibe III Dam.

Local and international environmental groups expect major negative environmental and social impacts of the dam and have criticized the project's environmental and social impact assessment as insufficient. Because of this and accusations that the entire approval process for the project was suspect,&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;BBC News:[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7959563.stm The dam that divides Ethiopians], March 26, 2009, accessed on October 17, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; funding for the full construction cost has not yet been secured, as the [[African Development Bank]] has delayed a decision about a loan pending a review of the dam's environmental impact by its compliance review and mediation unit which in August 2009 accepted a call from NGOs for such a review.&lt;ref&gt;Ethiofact.com:[http://www.ethiofact.com/index.php?/20090804581/news/afdb.html AfDB to probe Ethiopian dam project], 4 August 2009, accessed on December 20, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2010 Ethiopian Prime Minister [[Meles Zenawi]] vowed to complete the dam "at any cost", saying about critics of the dam that "They don’t want to see developed Africa; they want us to remain undeveloped and backward to serve their tourists as a museum."&lt;ref&gt;News Business Ethiopia:[http://www.newbusinessethiopia.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=224:african-policymakers-discuss-on-civil-status-information-&amp;catid=13:regional-politics&amp;Itemid=6 Meles Vows to Complete Gibe III Dam at Any Cost], 11 August 2010, accessed on 18 September 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==
The Gilgel Gibe III Dam is {{convert|610|m|ft|abbr=on|adj=mid|-long}} and {{convert|243|m|ft|abbr=on}} high [[roller-compacted concrete]] dam. It withholds a [[reservoir]] with a capacity of {{convert|14.7|km3|mi3|abbr=on}} and a surface area of {{convert|210|km2|mi2|abbr=on}}, collecting with a catchment area of {{convert|34150|km2|mi2|abbr=on}}. The reservoir's live (active or "useful") storage is {{convert|11.75|km3|mi3|abbr=on}} and dead storage {{convert|2.95|km3|mi3|abbr=on}}. The normal operating level of the reservoir is {{convert|892|m|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level with a maximum of {{convert|893|m|ft|abbr=on}} and minimum of {{convert|800|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The dam's [[spillway]] is {{convert|108|m|ft|abbr=on}} long and [[floodgate]]-controlled with a maximum discharge capacity of {{convert|18000|m3/s|ft3/s|abbr=on}}. Water above {{convert|873|m|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level can be discharged through its gates. Feeding the dam's power house are two [[penstock]]s that each branch into five separate tunnels for each individual turbine. The power house contains ten 187&amp;nbsp;MW [[Electrical generator|generator]]s supported by [[Francis turbine]]s for a total installed capacity of 1,870&amp;nbsp;MW.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Gibe III Hydroelectric Project Official Website - Brief|url=http://www.gibe3.com.et/brief.html|publisher=Gibe3 Hydroelectric Project|accessdate=26 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The initial design of the dam foresaw a rock-fill dam. However, due to difficulties with obtaining proper and sufficient insurance coverage for the rock-fill dam, the design has been changed to roller-compacted concrete.


==Benefits==
The main benefit of the dam will be [[Energy in Ethiopia|electricity generation]] that is both [[Renewable energy|renewable]] and [[Dispatchable generation|dispatchable]]. It is expected to supply about half of its power to Ethiopia and export the other half to [[Kenya]] (500 MW), [[Sudan]] (200 MW) and [[Djibouti]] (200 MW).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allafrica.com/stories/200607210970.html "Ethiopia, Italian Company Sign $2 Billion Hydro Power Project"] (All Africa), subscription required; accessed 21 July 2006&lt;/ref&gt; However, no [[Power Purchase Agreement]]s have been signed yet between Ethiopia and any of these countries. Only Kenya signed a Memorandum of Understanding to purchase electricity from the dam. Financing for a transmission line to Kenya was approved by the World Bank in July 2012.

Access to the electricity grid in Ethiopia currently is very low. Less than 2% of Ethiopia's rural population, which accounts for 85% of the total population, have access to the grid. With the support of the [[World Bank]] the government is carrying out an ambitious project to expand rural electricity access.&lt;ref&gt;Ethiopia Electric Agency:[http://ethiopiaref.energyprojects.net/ Ethiopia Energy Access Project], accessed on October 17, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, low generation capacity combined with a severe drought caused power cuts lasting 15 hours twice a week for a period of six months, costing an estimated $200 million in economic output.&lt;ref name="IRN"/&gt; In 2008 and 2009, Ethiopia again experienced power cuts and [[Brownout (electricity)|brownout]]s. According to the [[International Rivers Network]] the power cuts were caused by drought, since almost all electricity generation in Ethiopia is hydroelectric.
According to the same source, despite an increase in access to the electric grid, electricity consumption is likely to remain low for the foreseeable future due to the prevailing level of poverty.&lt;ref name="IRN"/&gt; Even without the Gibe III hydro plant, according to one source Ethiopia had a surplus installed capacity of 400 megawatts.&lt;ref&gt;[[Allafrica.com]]:[http://allafrica.com/stories/200907021232.html Ethiopia: AfDB Set to Start Funding Country's Gibe Dam], July 3, 2009, accessed on December 20, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Under Ethiopia’s current development plans it is said that the country will be more than 95% dependent on hydroelectric power. Ethiopia also predicted that the electricity power exports can bring about $407 million a year for the country and this amount is well above the country’s most valuable coffee export.&lt;ref name="IRN"/&gt;

A secondary benefit of the project will be flood protection. In 2006, a flood claimed the lives of at least 360 people and thousands of livestock in the lower Omo River basin. Allegedly, a further benefit would be a reduction in the impact of droughts,&lt;ref&gt;Seleshi Bekele and Jonathan Lautze:[http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/opinionla/la-oew-lautze4-2009jun04,0,2284769.story Blowback:Ethiopia's Gibe III dam: a balanced assessment], [[Los Angeles Times]], accessed on May 7, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; presumably through the planned large, foreign-owned irrigated sugar plantations.

==Controversy==
The project is controversial because of its environmental and social impact, the magnitude of which in itself is a subject of controversy; because of the award of the construction contract without competitive bidding; and because of an alleged lack of transparency in project affairs. For example, the environmental and social impact assessment was not published until two years after construction began.&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt; The assessment suggested that the project would cause minimal problems environmentally and socially. However critics consider it to be flawed both in terms of thoroughness and objectivity. Among these critics is the African Resources Working Group who released statements saying that "The quantitative [and qualitative] data included in virtually all major sections of the report were clearly selected for their consistence with the predetermined objective of validating the completion of the Gibe III hydro-dam"&lt;ref name="ARWG"/&gt; and that despite claims made by the government to the contrary, the dam would "produce a broad range of negative effects, some of which would be catastrophic." &lt;ref name="ARWG"/&gt; Another prominent critic of the dam is the Kenyan [[paleoanthropologist]] [[Richard Leakey]] who said that "the project is fatally flawed in terms of its logic, in terms of its thoroughness, in terms of its conclusions".&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Leakey]]:[http://richardleakey.wildlifedirect.org/2009/03/26/the-gibe-iii-dam-must-be-stopped/ The Gibe III dam must be stopped], March 26, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2011 [[UNESCO]]'s [[World Heritage Committee]], in its 35th session held in Paris, France, called for the construction of the dam to be halted, to submit all assessments of the dam and requested Ethiopia and Kenya to invite a World Heritage Centre/[[IUCN]] monitoring mission to review the dam's impact on [[Lake Turkana]], a [[World Heritage Site]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Berhane|first=Daniel|title=TEXT OF UN BODY DECISION ON GIBE III DAM PROJECT|url=http://danielberhane.wordpress.com/2011/07/23/text-of-un-body-decision-on-gibe-iii-dam-project/|accessdate=23 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Environmental and social impact==
According to the Ethiopian authorities, once the dam has been built the total amount of water flowing into the lake will not change. The only difference would be a more stable flow over the year - more during the dry season, and less during the wet. Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi said in a BBC interview: "The overall environmental impact of the project is highly beneficial. It increases the amount of water in the river system, it completely regulates flooding which was a major problem, it improves the livelihood of people downstream because they will have irrigation projects, and it does not in any way negatively affect the Turkana Lake. This is what our studies show."&lt;ref&gt;Ethiopian President Meles Zenawi in a [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL2SKelDbdQ&amp;feature=related BBC interview], March 2009, Minutes 4:25 to 5:10&lt;/ref&gt;

According to critics, the dam will be potentially devastating to the indigenous population.&lt;ref name="ARWG"&gt;African Resources Working Group:[http://www.arwg-gibe.org/ A Commentary on the Environmental, Socioeconomic and Human Rights Impacts of the Proposed Gibe III Hydrodam in the Lower Omo River Basin of Southwest Ethiopia], January 2009, accessed on October 17, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The dam will stop the seasonal flood, which will impact the lower reach of the Omo River and Lake Turkana as well as the people who rely on these ecosystems for their livelihoods. According to Terri Hathaway, director of [[International Rivers]]' Africa programme, Gibe III is "the most destructive dam under construction in Africa." The project would condemn "half a million of the region's most vulnerable people to hunger and conflict."&lt;ref&gt;BBC:[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/8582682.stm Web campaign against Ethiopia Gibe III dam], 23 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===Impact on the livelihoods of the inhabitants of the lower Omo River Valley===
It is estimated that more than 200,000 people rely on the Omo River below the dam for some form of subsistence such as flood recession agriculture, and many of these ethnic groups live in chronic hunger. Critics state that the Gibe III dam may worsen their situation. Indigenous people rely on recessional cultivation of food along the riverbanks, as well as livestock herding, for survival. The Gibe III dam and the associated decrease in water levels and seasonality of flows in the Omo River threaten the continuation of the only two options for survival in this arid environment—there are no alternatives.&lt;ref name="ARWG"/&gt; The people living in the project area are part of the [[Southern Nations, Nationalities, and Peoples' Region|Southern Nations of Ethiopia]], a highly diverse group of people. Ethnic groups affected by the dam include eight distinct indigenous communities: the [[Mursi people|Mursi]], Bodi ([[Mekan people|Mekan]]), [[Muguji]] (Kwegu), Kara (Karo), [[Hamer people|Hamer]], [[Bashada]], [[Nyangatom people|Nyangatom]] and [[Daasanach people|Daasanach]].&lt;ref  name="IRN"&gt;[[International Rivers Network]]:[http://www.internationalrivers.org/files/Gibe3FS_051509final.pdf Ethiopia’s Gibe 3 Dam: Sowing Hunger and Conflict], May 2009, accessed on October 17, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Stephen Corry]], Director of the indigenous rights organization [[Survival International]] said, "The Gibe III dam will be a disaster of cataclysmic proportions for the tribes of the Omo valley. Their land and livelihoods will be destroyed, yet few have any idea what lies ahead. The government has violated Ethiopia’s constitution and international law in the procurement process. No respectable outside body should be funding this atrocious project." Other sources note that, when interviewed, people in many villages have never even heard of the Gibe III dam, and many of them did not even know what a dam was.&lt;ref name="ARWG"/&gt; This is an indication of the failure of consultations and informed consent for the indigenous populations. Survival, together with the Campaign for the Reform of the World Bank, [[Counter Balance]] coalition, Friends of Lake Turkana and International Rivers have launched a petition to stop the dam.&lt;ref&gt;[[Survival International]]:[http://www.survivalinternational.org/news/5683 Giant dam to devastate 200,000 tribal people in Ethiopia], 23 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Dam proponents argue that artificial floods are planned to be released from the reservoir. Furthermore, irrigation projects are envisaged to improve the livelihoods of the downstream population.&lt;ref name="Salini"/&gt; As it became known to a wider public in November 2011 through a report by the Oakland Institute, there are indeed massive plans for cotton and sugarcane plantations on 445,000 ha in the lower Omo Valley. The sugarcane plantations could be financed with aid from India, which is heavily engaged in developing Ethiopian sugar production. The investors in the plantations are mostly Ethiopian state-owned companies.&lt;ref name="Oakland Institute"/&gt;

===Reports about human rights violations===
There are also reports about human rights violations by the Ethiopian army against locals who oppose the sugar plantations in the lower Omo Valley that would be irrigated with water from the dam's reservoir. According to the reports, "villagers are expected to voice immediate support, otherwise beatings (including the use of [[taser]]s), abuse, and general intimidation occurs", (...) "instilling a sense of fear regarding any opposition to sugar plantation plans."&lt;ref name="Oakland Institute"&gt;{{cite web|title=Understanding land investment deals in Africa: Half a million lives threatened by land development for sugar plantations in Ethiopia’s lower Omo Valley|url=http://media.oaklandinstitute.org/sites/oaklandinstitute.org/files/Land_Deal_Brief_Ethiopia_Omo_Valley.pdf|publisher=Oakland Institute|accessdate=26 December 2011|pages=2–3|date=September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Impact on the ecosystems of the lower Omo River Valley===
The decreased water flow of the Omo River resulting from the Gibe III dam will have significant impacts on the ecosystems surrounding the river. The Omo River Basin is home to the only pristine riparian forest remaining in the drylands of sub-Saharan Africa. The survival of this forest is dependent upon the seasonal flooding of the Omo River, which will cease with construction of the dam. This may cause 290 km2 of forest to "dry out" from lack of water. The decreased water flow will also negatively impact, if not eliminate, all economic activities associated with the Omo River such as farming, fishing, and tourism. The water level of the Omo River is crucial for recharging groundwater supplies in the Omo basin.&lt;ref name="ARWG"/&gt; If the water level of the river drops once the Gibe III dam is built, then it will no longer be able to refill underground water supplies, leaving much of the basin bereft of groundwater, which negatively impacts people and ecosystems. As the water level of the Omo River drops, the erosion of its riverbanks will increase, causing increased sediment flows in the river, loss of soil for crop cultivation along the riverbanks, and loss of riparian habitats.&lt;ref name="ARWG"/&gt;
 
A December 2012 study stated Ethiopia's Gibe III dam would cause humanitarian catastrophe and major cross-border armed conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Humanitarian Catastrophe and Regional Armed Conflict Brewing in the Transborder Region of Ethiopia, Kenya and South Sudan: The Proposed Gibe III Dam in Ethiopia|url=http://www.arwg-gibe.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Construction of one of the world’s tallest dams on the Omo River in southern Ethiopia will lead to mass starvation among a half million indigenous people in an already famine-prone region, sparking major armed conflict in the three-nation border region over its disappearing natural resources, according to a new report from the African Resources Working Group (ARWG).

"Humanitarian Catastrophe and Regional Armed Conflict Brewing in the Transborder Region of Ethiopia, Kenya, and South Sudan: The Proposed Gibe III Dam in Ethiopia" analyzes the full scale of impacts of the dam and charges that no environmental or social review of the full cross-border impact area has been carried out by the Ethiopian government or international development banks involved in the project, including the World Bank.  It is authored by a member of the ARWG and long-term researcher in the region, Claudia J. Carr, an Associate Professor at the University of California, Berkeley.  The 250-page report is based on substantial field-based research involving the participation of local residents throughout much of the cross-border region.

The Gibe III dam is already under construction by Ethiopia along its Omo River, with general recognition that it will cause a major decrease in river flow downstream and a serious reduction of inflow to Kenya's Lake Turkana, which receives 90 per cent of its waters from the river.  According to the ARWG report, these changes will destroy the survival means of at least 200,000 pastoralists, flood-dependent agriculturalists and fishers along the Omo River 300,000 pastoralists and fishers around the shores of Lake Turkana - plunging the region’s ethnic groups into cross-border violent conflict reaching well into South Sudan, as starvation confronts all of them.

The report offers a devastating look a deeply flawed development process fueled by the special interests of global finance and African governments.  In the process, it identifies major overlooked or otherwise minimized risks, not the least of which is a U.S. Geological Survey estimation of a high risk for a magnitude 7 or 8 earthquake in the Gibe III dam region.

===Impact on Lake Turkana===
The magnitude of the impact that the dam and possible irrigation projects induced by the dam will have on the water level of Lake Turkana is controversial. A hydrological study conducted for the African Development Bank in November 2010 concluded that the filling of the dam will reduce the lake's water level by two metres, if no irrigation will be undertaken. Irrigation would cause a further drop in the lake level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Avery|first=Sean|title=Hydrological Impacts of Ethiopia’s Omo Basin on Kenya’s Lake Turkana Water Levels &amp; Fisheries. Final report.|url=http://www.friendsoflaketurkana.org/images/docs/report_nov_2010_s_avery_turkana_small_file.pdf|publisher=African Development Bank|accessdate=26 December 2011|pages=4–2|date=November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Friends of Lake Turkana, a Kenyan organization representing indigenous groups in northwestern Kenya whose livelihoods are linked to Lake Turkana, had previously estimated that the dam could reduce the level of [[Lake Turkana]] by up to 10 meter affecting up to 300,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bank Information Center]]:[http://www.bicusa.org/en/Article.11057.aspx Kenyan indigenous groups file complaint with AfDB on Ethiopian dam], March 2, 2009, accessed on October 17, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; This could cause the brackish water to increase in salinity to where it may no longer be drinkable by the indigenous groups around the lake. Currently, the salinity of the water is about 2332&amp;nbsp;mg/L, and it is estimated that a 10-meter decrease in the water level of Lake Turkana could cause the salinity to rise to 3397&amp;nbsp;mg/L.&lt;ref name="ARWG"/&gt; Raising salinity could also drastically reduce the number of fish in the lake, which the people around Lake Turkana depend on for sustenance and their livelihoods. According to critics, this "will condemn the lake to a not-so-slow death."&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt;

According to dam proponents, the impact on Lake Turkana will be limited to the temporary reduction in flows during the filling of the reservoir. Various sources state that the filling could take between one and three wet seasons.&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Salini"&gt;Statement by Salini on Ethiopia News:[http://www.ethiopian-news.com/ethiopia-gibe-iii-project-facts/ Gibe III project Facts], 1 April 2010, accessed on September 18, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The total storage volume of the reservoir of Gibe III dam will be between 11.75 and 14 billion cubic meter, depending on sources. According to the firm that builds the dam this would reduce the water level in the lake by "less than 50 cm per year for three years" and that salinity "will not change in any way".&lt;ref name="Salini"/&gt;

According to the International Lake Environment Committee, 90% of Lake Turkana's water is delivered by the Omo River on which the Dam would be built.&lt;ref name=ILEC&gt;{{cite web|title=Lake Turkana|url=http://wldb.ilec.or.jp/data/databook_html/afr/afr-20.html|website=International Lake Environment Committee Foundation|accessdate=18 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; With no outlet, Lake Turkana loses 2.3 meters of water every year to evaporation, and its level is sensitive to climatic and seasonal fluctuations. For purposes of comparison, the historic level of Lake Turkana declined from a high of 20m above today's level in the 1890s to the same level as today in the 1940s and 1950s. Then it increased again gradually by 7 meters to reach a peak around 1980, and subsequently decreased again.&lt;ref name=ILEC /&gt;

The Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) summary of the project did not assess the impact of the dam on the water level and water quality of Lake Turkana.&lt;ref&gt;Gibe III Hydroelectric Project:[http://www.gibe3.com.et/ESIA%20SUMMARY.htm Environmental and Social Impact Assessment Summary for Gibe III hydroelectric project], accessed on October 17, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The director of Kenya's Water Services Regulatory Board, John Nyaoro, argued that the dam would have no negative impact on Lake Turkana.&lt;ref name="IWA"&gt;Water 21, Magazine of the [[International Water Association]]:Ethiopia's Gibe III dam funding under review after protests against its impact, p. 5, October 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other impacts===
It was predicted that there is about 50-75% leakage of waters from the reservoir due to multiple fractures in the basalts at the planned reservoir site.&lt;ref name="IRN"/&gt; Due to the loss of the waters in reservoir, the dam would not be able to produce as much electricity and less hydro power would be available to export to other nearby countries. Also, the dam and reservoir are vulnerable to seismic activity such as earthquakes and massive landslides in the Gibe III project region.&lt;ref name="ARWG"/&gt; The earthquakes can cause even larger fractures to the dam and are susceptible to more water leakage as well as decreasing the economic inputs. Moreover, the landslides would fill up the reservoir and less water capacity can be stored. This would also mean that less hydro power can be produced.&lt;ref name="IRN"/&gt;

===Environmental and social impact assessment===
Controversy arose also as the environmental and social impact assessment and preceding environmental impact study (EIS) were not done until two years after beginning construction on the dam.&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt; The Ethiopian Environmental Protection Authority requires that an environmental impact assessment be done for any project "likely to entail significant adverse environmental impacts" and that "the EIS must submitted before commencing any construction or any other implementation of the project." &lt;ref name="Permit Requirement"&gt;Ethiopian Environmental Protection Authority: [http://www.epa.gov.et/epa/departments/eia_services/eia_services.asp?dep_Id=4&amp;sub_depId=14 Permit Requirement] Published 2006. Accessed 8 June 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Official environmental and social impact assessment====
An Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) has been carried out by Centro Elettrotecnico Sperimentale Italiano (CESI) and Agriconsulting of Italy, in association with MDI Consulting Engineers from Ethiopia. According to Anthony Mitchell, an engineer who submitted an independent feasibility study of the dam to the African Development Bank, CESI's owners include vendors who can benefit from the project and this conflict of interest is not disclosed in the impact statement.&lt;ref name="Mitchell"&gt;[http://anthonymitchell.com/ Anthony Mitchell]:[http://www.slideshare.net/anthony_mitchell/gilgel-gibe-iii-hydroelectric-dam-ethiopia-technical-engineering-and-economic-feasibility-study-report Gilgel Gibe III dam Ethiopia: technical, engineering and economic feasibility study report], April 15, 2009, accessed on March 24, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the assessment, according to the Project Company, public consultations were carried out with "officials and institutions, people affected by the project and non-governmental organizations".&lt;ref name="Gibe"/&gt; According to critics, these consultations have been minimal. Most importantly, the assessment was only completed in July 2008, nearly two years after construction began, in violation of Ethiopian law and in contrast to global good practice of environmental assessments.&lt;ref name="IRN"/&gt; Also, an independent environmental advisory panel has been established only as late as July 2009,&lt;ref name="Gibe"/&gt; apparently in a belated effort to appease criticism of the project.

====Alternative environmental impact statement====
The Africa Resources Working Group (ARWG), a collaborative of eight consultants from around the world, conducted an independent environmental impact statement of their own for the Gibe III dam. The alternative impact statement was performed because of the alleged corruption and inaccuracy of the official impact assessment.&lt;ref name="ARWG"/&gt; The ARWG criticizes many of the statements made in the official Gibe III ESIA. Regarding the flow of water into Lake Turkana, they state that the Gibe III dam will result in a 57-60% decrease of river flow volume.&lt;ref name="ARWG"/&gt; The ARWG also notes that it is not necessarily the volume of water that is important to the Omo River and Turkana ecosystems, but that the seasonality and timing of the water flow is crucial, because certain biota are adapted to feeding, reproducing, growing, etc. in response to seasonal changes in water flow.&lt;ref name="ARWG"/&gt; Artificially releasing water from the Gibe III dam into the Omo River will not be sufficient to meet the needs of these biota. Additionally, the ARWG states that there is "no precedent of successful and sustained implementation" of an artificial flood simulation program in sub-Saharan Africa, so it is not guaranteed that such a program will be maintained at the Gibe III dam.&lt;ref name="ARWG"/&gt;

==Award of construction contract==
The contract for the construction of the dam was awarded in 2006 to [[Salini Impregilo|Salini Costruttori]] of Italy . The engineering design was awarded to Studio Pietrangeli&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=www.pietrangeli.com|title=Gibe III dam project on Studio Pietrangeli Website|url=http://www.pietrangeli.com/gibe-3-rcc-dam-ethiopia-africa|accessdate=28 Oct 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and supervision of ELC-COB ([[ELC Electroconsult]], Italy - [[Coyne et Bellier]], France) as representative of the Ethiopian Electric Power Corporation. The contract to Salini Construttori was awarded after direct negotiation rather than allowing bidding on the contract from other qualified companies. Public international financial institutions require competitive bidding of construction contracts, making it difficult for the Ethiopian government to get a loan from them.&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt; The bypassing of the standard process was defended by general manager of the Ethiopian Electric Power Corporation, Mihert Debeba, as skipping a set of "luxurious preconditions" that Ethiopia could not meet, one which would completely halt any development of hydroelectric power.&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt;

==Costs and financing==
The financial costs of the dam and hydroelectric power plant have been estimated to be 1.55 billion Euro. The cost of a transmission line from the power plant to the nearby Wolayta Sodo Substation has been estimated at 35 Million Euro. These costs do not include the costs of constructing or upgrading power transmission lines to Addis Abeba and onwards to Djibouti to the Northeast of the dam, to Sudan in the West and to Kenya in the South, all located at a distance between 500 and 1000&amp;nbsp;km from the dam. The cost estimate does not include the costs of extending the electricity distribution network to effectively increase access to electricity. As of 2009, electricity access in the prospective beneficiary countries was still low at 16% in Kenya and 36% in Sudan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=World Bank|title=Access to electricity (% of population)|url=http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/EG.ELC.ACCS.ZS|accessdate=7 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the official website of Gibe III, most of the construction cost of the dam itself is financed by the Ethiopian government with its own funds.&lt;ref name="Gibe"/&gt; However, part of the project is financed through a corporate bond called "Millennium Bond" issued by the Ethiopian Electric Power Corporation (EEPCO) and marketed with the Ethiopian diaspora.&lt;ref&gt;Genet Mersha, [http://www.abugidainfo.com/?page_id=7331 Abugida Information Center]:[http://www.abugidainfo.com/?p=8524 LET THERE BE LIGHT!—THE GILGEL GIBE SAGA, THE BOND &amp; DILEMMA OF ETHIOPIAN DIASPORA], April 6, 2009, accessed on March 24, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The Ethiopian government also had requested financing of US$250 million from the Italian government for civil works. In 2008, [[JPMorgan Chase]] and the Italian export credit agency SACE refused to provide financing.

In May 2010 EEPCo and Dongfang Electric Machinery Corporation, a Chinese state-owned company, signed a memorandum of understanding to provide electrical and mechanical equipment for the project. The agreement is backed by a loan from the [[Industrial and Commercial Bank of China]] reportedly covering 85% of the US$495 million cost.&lt;ref name="International Rivers"&gt;[[International Rivers]]:[http://www.internationalrivers.org/en/2010513/china’s-biggest-bank-support-africa’s-most-destructive-dam   China’s Biggest Bank to Support Africa’s Most Destructive Dam] Published 13 May 2010.

It has financed economic, financial and technical studies for the dam.&lt;ref name="Gibe"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IRN"/&gt; In July 2010 the EIB stopped financing environmental and social studies for the dam, stating that "alternative financing" had been found.&lt;ref&gt;Bloomberg:[http://www.ethiopian-news.com/eib-halts-funding-of-gibe-iii-dam-studies-in-ethiopia/ EIB Halts Funding of Gibe III Dam Studies in Ethiopia 19 July 2010], accessed on 18 September 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The [[African Development Bank]] had also been considering a US$250 million loan for the electro-mechanical equipment of the plant. The [[World Bank]] also had considered funding the project. In 2008 the World Bank decided not to pursue a full feasibility study for the dam, because of the absence of competitive bidding for the prime contractor.&lt;ref name="Mitchell"/&gt;

The [[Exim Bank of China]] finances the transmission line to the Addis Ababa. The contract has been awarded to the Chinese Company [[Tebian Electric Apparatus Stock Co., Ltd.]] (TBEA) on July 24, 2009.&lt;ref name="Gibe"/&gt;

In July 2012 the World Bank approved a US$684 million loan for an Eastern Electricity Highway Project that will finance a 500 Kilovolt [[High Voltage Direct Current]] transmission line between the Wolayta/Sodo substation in Ethiopia and the Suswa substation in Kenya.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=World Bank|title=The Eastern Electricity Highway Project under the First Phase of the Eastern Africa Power Integration Program|url=http://www.worldbank.org/projects/P126579/regional-eastern-africa-power-pool-project-apl1?lang=en|accessdate=2 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Environmental groups have criticized the loan as funding for the Gilgel Gibe III Dam through the backdoor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bosshard|first=Peter|title=Ethiopia: World Bank to Fund Destructive Dam through the Backdoor?|url=http://www.internationalpolicydigest.org/2012/05/22/ethiopia-world-bank-to-fund-destructive-dam-through-the-backdoor/|work=[[International Policy Digest]]|accessdate=2 September 2012|date=22 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gilgel Gibe IV dam==
A $1.9 billion deal between [[Ethiopia–People's Republic of China relations|China’s]] [[Sino Hydro Corporation]] and the Ethiopian Electric Power Authority to construct the Gibe IV and Halele Werabesa hydroelectric dams was reported by ''[[Shanghai Daily|The Shanghai Daily]]'' on 15 July 2009. Both dams are "expected to be completed in five years", and would have a combined capacity of over 2,000 megawatts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecoseed.org/index.php/general-news/green-politics/green-policies/africa-a-the-middle-east/3390 "China, Ethiopia strike $ 1.9-B hydroelectric deal"], Ecoseed Portal website, published 17 July 2009 (accessed 19 August 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10767">'''HIV/AIDS in [[Eswatini|Swaziland]]''' was first reported in 1986 but has since reached [[epidemic]] proportions due in large part to cultural beliefs which discourage safe-sex practices. Coupled with a high rate of co-infection with tuberculosis, life expectancy has halved in the first decade of the millennium. Swaziland has the highest prevalence of HIV as percentage of population (adults 15-49 years) in the world as of 2016 (27.2%).&lt;ref name="unaids16"&gt;{{cite web|title=Swaziland 2016 Country factsheet|url=http://www.unaids.org/en/regionscountries/countries/swaziland|website=[[UNAIDS]]|accessdate=14 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Prevalence of HIV, total (% of population ages 15-49)|url=http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SH.DYN.AIDS.ZS/countries/1W?display=default|publisher=The World Bank|accessdate=6 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prevalence==
[[File:Prevalence of HIV, total of population ages 15-49.pdf|right|500px|Prevalence of HIV, total of population ages 15-49. Source: World Bank]]
[[HIV/AIDS]] remains one of the major challenges to [[Swaziland]]'s [[socioeconomic development]]. The epidemic has spread relentlessly in all the parts of the country since the first reported case in 1986.&lt;ref name=usaid08 /&gt;

Periodic surveillance of [[Prenatal care|prenatal clinics]] in the country has shown a consistent rise in HIV prevalence among pregnant women attending the clinics. The most recent surveillance in antenatal women reported an overall prevalence of 42.6% in 2004. Prevalence of 28% was found among young women aged 15–19. In women ages 25–29, prevalence was 56%.&lt;ref name=usaid&gt;[http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/global_health/aids/Countries/africa/swaziland_05.pdf "Health Profile: Swaziland"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080817052259/http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/global_health/aids/Countries/africa/swaziland_05.pdf |date=2008-08-17 }}. [[United States Agency for International Development]] (June 2005). {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Human Development Index]] from the [[UN Development Programme]] reports that as a consequence of HIV/AIDS, [[life expectancy]] in Swaziland has fallen from 61 years in 2000, to 32 years in 2009.&lt;ref name="unhcrAIDS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/docid/49e6ef2dc.html|title=Swaziland: A culture that encourages HIV/AIDS|date=15 April 2009|publisher=[[Integrated Regional Information Networks]] (IRIN)|accessdate=2009-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From another perspective, the last available World Health Organization data (2002) shows that 64% of all deaths in the country were caused by HIV/AIDS.&lt;ref&gt;Swaziland, Mortality Country Fact Sheet 2006. WHO. {{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/whosis/mort/profiles/mort_afro_swz_swaziland.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-11-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090805140020/http://www.who.int/whosis/mort/profiles/mort_afro_swz_swaziland.pdf |archivedate=2009-08-05 |df= }}.

Accessed October 6, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; this implies that HIV/AIDS kills an estimated 0.6% of the Swazi population every year.  Chronic illnesses that are the most prolific causes of death in the developed world only account for a minute fraction of deaths in Swaziland; for example, [[heart disease]], [[strokes]], and [[cancer]] cause a total of less than 5% of deaths in Swaziland, compared to 55% of all deaths yearly in the US.&lt;ref&gt;Causes of death in US, 2006.

==History ==
The first reported case of HIV in Swaziland was in 1987. The spread of HIV throughout Swaziland in the 1990s coincided with the increase of migrant workers from Swaziland to the mines of South Africa.&lt;ref name="Migration-Induced HIV and AIDS"&gt;{{cite book|last=Crush|first=Jonathan|title=Migration-Induced HIV and AIDS in Rural Mozambique and Swaziland|date=2010|publisher=Idasa|isbn=978-1-920409-49-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural background==
Traditional Swazi culture discourages [[safe sex|safe sexual practices]], like [[condom]] use and [[Monogamy|monogamous relationships]]. There is a cultural belief in [[procreation]] to increase the population size, and Swazis believe a woman should have a minimum of five children and that a man's role is to impregnate as many partners as he can. Men may never get married but still have many children from multiple partners.&lt;ref name="unhcrAIDS" /&gt; The few men who do get married often practice [[polygamy]]. Sexual aggression is common, with 18% of sexually active high school students saying they were coerced into their first sexual encounter.&lt;ref name="usaid08"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/global_health/aids/Countries/africa/swaziland_profile.pdf|title=Swaziland HIV/AIDS health profile|date=September 2008|publisher=[[USAID]]|accessdate=2009-10-21|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090910223400/http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/global_health/aids/Countries/africa/swaziland_profile.pdf|archivedate=2009-09-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many thousands of children have been orphaned by AIDS, and only 22% grow up in two-parent families.&lt;ref name="actionplan"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.sz/home.asp?pid=5629&amp;ItemID=5667&amp;ToolID=6|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100117202602/http://www.gov.sz/home.asp?pid=5629&amp;ItemID=5667&amp;ToolID=6|dead-url=yes|archive-date=17 January 2010|title=GOVERNMENT'S PROGRAMME OF ACTION 2008-2013|date=27 March 2009|publisher=The Government of the Kingdom of Swaziland|pages=4–5|accessdate=2009-10-21|df=}} &lt;/ref&gt;

==National response==
In 2003, the National Emergency Response Committee on HIV/AIDS (NERCHA) was established to coordinate and facilitate the national multisectoral response to HIV/AIDS, while the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare (MOHSW) was to implement activities. The previous national HIV/AIDS strategic plan covered the period 2000–2005; a new national HIV/AIDS strategic plan and a national HIV/AIDS action plan for the 2006–2008 period are currently being developed by a broad group of national stakeholders. To date, the six key areas of the plan are prevention, care and support, impact mitigation, communications, monitoring and evaluation, and management/coordination.&lt;ref name=usaid/&gt;

Despite the widespread nature of the epidemic in Swaziland, HIV/AIDS is still heavily stigmatized. Few people living with HIV/AIDS, particularly prominent people such as religious and traditional leaders and media/sports personalities, have come out publicly and revealed their status. Stigma hinders the flow of information to communities, hampers prevention efforts, and reduces utilization of services.&lt;ref name=usaid/&gt;

On June 4, 2009, the USA and Swaziland signed the ''Swaziland Partnership Framework on HIV and AIDS for 2009-2014''. The [[President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief]] will contribute to the implementation of Swaziland's multi-sectoral ''National Strategic Framework on HIV/AIDS''.&lt;ref name="pepfar"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pepfar.gov/countries/swaziland/|title=Partnership to Fight HIV/AIDS in Swaziland|publisher=Office of U.S. Global AIDS Coordinator and the Bureau of Public Affairs, U.S. State Department.|accessdate=2009-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plan was reconducted with a new eNSF (National Strategic Framework) for 2014-2018.&lt;ref name="unaidssw"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unaids.org/sites/default/files/country/documents/SWZ_narrative_report_2014.pdf|title=SWAZILAND GLOBAL AIDS RESPONSE PROGRESS REPORTING 2014|publisher=Joint United Nations Programme on HIV and AIDS (UNAIDS).|accessdate=2017-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various community responses have been implemented as a result of this plan, consisting in the implementation of a decentralised coordination. For example, the formation of 3 regional and community structures, including [[Nhlangano AIDS Training Information and Counseling Center]] in the [[Shiselweni Region]].&lt;ref name="unaidssw"/&gt;

==HIV-TB co-infection==
[[Tuberculosis]] is also a significant problem, with an 18 percent mortality rate. Many patients have a multi-drug resistant strain, and 83 percent are co-infected with HIV.&lt;ref name="msf"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/news/article.cfm?id=4034&amp;cat=field-news|title=Swaziland: An MSF Doctors Explains HIV-TB Co-Infection|date=October 28, 2009|publisher=[[Médecins Sans Frontières|Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières]]|accessdate=2009-10-31|location=USA|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725170922/http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/news/article.cfm?id=4034&amp;cat=field-news|archivedate=July 25, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are roughly 14,000 new TB cases diagnosed each year.&lt;ref name="hivtb"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/publications/article.cfm?id=4033&amp;cat=special-report|title=HIV-TB in Swaziland: A Deadly Co-Infection Epidemic|date=October 28, 2009|publisher=[[Médecins Sans Frontières|Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières]]|accessdate=2009-10-31|location=USA|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100621122506/http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/publications/article.cfm?id=4033&amp;cat=special-report|archivedate=June 21, 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hereditary neuralgic amyotrophy''' (HNA) is a neuralgic disorder that is characterized by [[nerve damage]] and [[muscle atrophy]], preceded by severe pain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=van Alfen N |title=The neuralgic amyotrophy consultation |journal=J. Neurol. |volume=254 |issue=6 |pages=695–704 |date=June 2007 |pmid=17446996 |pmc=2780663 |doi=10.1007/s00415-006-0246-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In about half of the cases it is associated with a mutation of the ''[[SEPT9]]'' gene (17q25). While not much is known about this disorder, it has been characterized to be similar to Parsonage-Turner syndrome in prognosis.&lt;ref name=OMIM&gt;{{OMIM|162100|Amyotrophy, Hereditary Neuralgic; Hna}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Symptoms ==
Symptoms of HNA may include pain in the back, neck, arms, or shoulders, nerve pulls in the arms or back, muscular atrophy, and weakness.&lt;ref name=OMIM/&gt;

=== Presentation ===
HNA is an episodic disorder; it is characterized by episodes generally lasting 1–6 weeks. During an episode, the nerves of the [[brachial plexus]] are targeted by the body as antigens, and the body's immune system begins to degenerate the nerves of the brachial plexus. The exact order or location of the nerve degeneration cannot be predicted before an episode. Other areas of the nervous system that have been affected are the [[phrenic nerve]]s and the recurrent laryngeal. As the nerves lose function, the muscles associated with those nerves begin to atrophy. In brachial plexus degeneration, atrophy may occur in the [[deltoid muscle|deltoid]] muscles. In phrenic nerve degeneration, the diaphragm may be affected. In this case, breathing can be impaired due to a lack of muscle control of the diaphragm. If the recurrent larangyl nerve is targeted, the [[human pharynx|pharynx]] will begin to atrophy and voice function may be lost.&lt;ref name=OMIM/&gt;
==Diagnosis==
{{Empty section|date=October 2017}}

== Treatment ==
The severe pain of HNA can be controlled with an anti-inflammatory drug such as [[prednisone]], although it is unknown whether these anti-inflammatory drugs actually slow or stop the nerve degeneration process.

Nerve regeneration after an episode is normal, and in less severe cases a full recovery of the nerves and muscles can be expected. However, in a severe case permanent nerve damage may occur.&lt;ref name=OMIM/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4784">The '''Hurley Group''' is a large provider of primary care services in London, one of only 3 organisations in England which served more than 100,000 patients in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Dominance of small GP practices undermines push for extended providers|url=http://www.hsj.co.uk/news/primary-care/dominance-of-small-gp-practices-undermines-push-for-extended-providers/5068088.article#.UyN6hYXBeU4|accessdate=14 March 2014|newspaper=Health Service Journal|date=19 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2012 it ran 13 practices, had 250 employees and provided a variety of NHS services across London.

Dr [[Clare Gerada]] is one of four GP partners in the firm. It was noted during her active campaign against the [[Health and Social Care Act 2012]] that the group could face substantial competition from private providers if they were allowed to compete equally to provide NHS services. Other GPs were reported as complaining that the Hurley Group was "swooping in and taking over in areas where it normally has no business".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Why Health Bill's biggest critic has a lot to lose from reforms |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/why-health-bills-biggest-critic-has-a-lot-to-lose-from-reforms-6660994.html|accessdate=15 March 2014|newspaper=Independent|date=8 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Expansion of larger organisations like the Hurley Group has been advocated as a means whereby the quality and capacity of primary care services in England could be enhanced, for example by the [[King's Fund]] report in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=HSJ Briefing: general practice services and policy|url=http://www.hsj.co.uk/hsj-local/local-briefing/hsj-briefing-general-practice-services-and-policy/5051162.article#.UyQcDoXBeU4|accessdate=15 March 2014|newspaper=Health Service Journal|date=30 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr Arvind Madan, Partner and Chief Executive made a presentation to the [[Nuffield Trust]] event "Transforming general practice: unlocking the potential" in May 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Arvind Madan: The Hurley Group story|url=http://www.nuffieldtrust.org.uk/talks/slideshows/arvind-madan-hurley-group-story|publisher=Nuffield Trust|accessdate=15 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2014 the group was awarded a five year £17m contract to provide urgent care centres outside Queen Mary’s Hospital and Erith Hospital by Bexley [[Clinical Commissioning Group]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hurley Group wins south-east London urgent care centre contract|url=http://www.hsj.co.uk/hsj-local/ccgs/nhs-bexley-ccg/hurley-group-wins-south-east-london-urgent-care-centre-contract/5072107.article#.U8QAuPldUk4|accessdate=14 July 2014|publisher=Health Service Journal|date=23 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All Saints Practice, in [[Poplar, London|Poplar]], east London, one of the 18 practices in the group, was put in [[special measures]] by the [[Care Quality Commission]] in April 2017. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hurley Group practice put in special measures|url=https://www.hsj.co.uk/7017173.article?mkt_tok=eyJpIjoiWmpJeE56QXdOVEJpT0RsbCIsInQiOiJwRWNuSENwOExpN0FqS2lJbWsxSkl0MU81eVBvRWdCc2gzVjV2MzNYb21SVDFpazR4YTMxaE9NVFwvUmRNWGNQc2p4amlmUGRWZms4YkhUQXo1emNlY0JEbGZ1clhoYlh0bGN1YzNqdXpWekd2dU9KT2FDT2N2eFpWVTdHUnEzYVwvIn0%3D|accessdate=2 May 2017|publisher=Health Service Journal|date=7 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2018 the practice announced that it planned to use its [[eConsult]] online system for most consultations.  This enables patients to submit their symptoms to a GP electronically, and offers around the clock NHS self-help information, signposting to services, and a symptom checker.  12 GPs are using eConsult and it is planned to recruit 12 more, so patients will only be seen in person where necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Leading superpractice plans to phase out unnecessary face-to-face consultations |url=http://www.pulsetoday.co.uk/news/gp-topics/it/leading-superpractice-plans-to-phase-out-unnecessary-face-to-face-consultations/20036811.article |accessdate=19 June 2018 |publisher=Pulse |date=15 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  340 other practices are also using eConsult, a majority of the 479 GP practices are expected to have implemented an online consultation system by April 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Hurley Group revealed as largest provider of online consultations |url=https://www.hsj.co.uk/technology-and-innovation/hurley-group-revealed-as-largest-provider-of-online-consultations-/7023267.article |accessdate=7 September 2018 |publisher=Health Service Journal |date=5 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="991">The '''International Association for Ambulatory Surgery'''
was formed in 1995 when clinicians from several countries who were interested in [[Outpatient surgery|ambulatory surgery]] (otherwise known as day surgery) came together to form the organisation which is run as a charity registered in Belgium. It aims to promote ambulatory surgery around the world and is run by an active General Assembly formed by representatives from each of the member countries. They organise a biennial International Congress in Ambulatory Surgery and have an electronic journal ''Ambulatory Surgery'' which is freely available online.

'''John Ordronaux''' (1830 - January 20, 1908) was an [[American Civil War]] army surgeon, a professor of [[medical jurisprudence]], a pioneering [[mental health]]  commissioner and a generous [[patron]] of university [[Financial endowment|endowments]].&lt;ref name="nytobit"&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  Between 1859 and 1901 Ordronaux published at least fifteen books and articles about subjects as diverse as heroes of the [[American Revolution]] of 1776, [[military medicine]], medical jurisprudence, mental health, United States constitutional law and historical treatises. He left an estate worth $2,757,000 much of which he gave in endowments to several US universities and other institutions.&lt;ref name="ordwill2" /&gt; He did not marry.&lt;ref name="nytobit" /&gt;

==Early life==
Ordronaux was the only son of Captain [[John Ordronaux (privateer)|John Ordronaux]] (a notable [[privateer]] of the [[War of 1812]]), and his wife Jean Marie Elizabeth Ordronaux (née Charretton). This is supported by the younger Ordronaux's will&lt;ref name="nytwill1"&gt;

Capt. Reader was the great grandson-in-law of Dr Ordronaux's father. Ref. Nav-2-LM DD617/S6-2(1)&lt;/ref&gt;

He graduated from [[Dartmouth College]] in 1850, from [[Harvard Law School]] in 1852, and from the [[National Medical School]] in 1859.&lt;ref name="nytobit" /&gt; In 1859 he published his first book a "Eulogy on the life and character of Rev. Zachariah Greene", who, before taking [[Holy Orders]], had fought under Washington in the revolution of 1776 at the age of seventeen.&lt;ref name="ordongreene"&gt;Ordronaux, J.

&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1861 he had also been a lecturer at [[Dartmouth College]], [[The University of Vermont]] and [[Boston University]].&lt;ref name="nytobit" /&gt;

==American Civil War==
During the [[American Civil War]] Ordronaux served as an army surgeon stationed in New York.&lt;ref name="nytobit" /&gt; He also acted as a military medical advisor and between 1861 and 1863 he published two textbooks on the health of armies,&lt;ref name="hints1"&gt;Ordronaux, J. Hints on the preservation of health in armies. Appleton, 1861.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hints2"&gt;Ordronaux, J. Hints on health in armies. D. Van Nostrand, 1863.&lt;/ref&gt; and an instruction manual of medical criteria for examining recruits.&lt;ref name="ordmanual"&gt;Ordronaux, J. Manual of Instructions for Military Surgeons on the Examination of Recruits. D Van Nostrand, 1863.&lt;/ref&gt; In the introduction to the latter,&lt;ref name="hints2" /&gt; which was written for the [[United States Sanitary Commission]], he said, "The preservation of health in armies, is everywhere a subject of recognized importance. So much, in fact, depends upon it, that precautionary measures in this behalf can never be exaggerated. All that can be done, should be done to protect troops against preventable disease. It seems to have been formerly believed, that the presence of a surgeon in each regiment was all sufficient for this purpose ; and that officers and men could go their way free from any responsibility or apprehension on that score. But experience has proved that the preservation of health, in either one man, or many, is not purely objective with surgeons. Too much, in this particular, is expected from them, and too little is done by officers to cooperate with them. Armies, like patients, must act in concert with their medical advisers, and make the matter of health subjective as well as objective. Officers and men need an insight into the general principles of hygiene, in order to be able to assist, themselves, in furthering prophylactic measures. To supply them with the requisite amount of information, the accompanying popular manual has therefore been prepared."

In 1863 he  wrote a historical treatise in French (with Reinaud) on the commercial and political relations between the [[Roman Empire]] and the countries of Oriental [[Asia]].&lt;ref name="ordrelations"&gt;Ordronaux, J. (with Reinaud, J.T.). Relations Politique et Commerciales de l'Empire Romain avec l'Asie Orientale. Imprimerie imperiale, 1863.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1864 he wrote a second report for the [[United States Sanitary Commission]]. This concerned pensions for the war wounded and was subtitled, "On a system for the economical relief of disabled soldiers, and on certain proposed amendments to our present pension laws".&lt;ref name="ordreport"&gt;Ordronaux, J. Report to the U.S. Sanitary Commission. Sanford, Harroun &amp; Co., 1864.&lt;/ref&gt;

==After the war==
After the war he returned to Columbia Law School and began writing again. Between 1867 and 1871 he produced a book on preventative medicine&lt;ref name="ordprophylaxis"&gt;Ordronaux, J. Prophylaxis, an anniversary oration. Baillière brothers; London, 1867.&lt;/ref&gt; and two textbooks on medical jurisprudence.&lt;ref name="ordjurisp"&gt;Ordronaux, J. The jurisprudence of medicine in its relation to the law of contracts, torts, and evidence. T. &amp; J.W. Johnson, 1869.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ordwinter"&gt;Ordronaux, J. In re William Winter. s.n., 1870.&lt;/ref&gt; He also translated into English verse the medieval Latin text of [[Regimen sanitatis Salernitanum]], the medical encyclopedia of the [[Scuola Medica Salernitana]].&lt;ref name="ordrss"&gt;Ordronaux, J. Translation into English verse of Regimen Sanitatis Salerni. Scuola Medica Salernitana. Lippincott, 1871.&lt;/ref&gt; [[:it:Scuola medica salernitana|This school]] in [[Salerno]], [[Italy]] was the pre-eminent medical school in Europe in the 11th century. This was not the first English translation but an attempt to make a medically accurate one. He appears to have done this as a tribute to former members of his profession and in an introduction to his work he said, "''Regimen Sanitatis Salerni'' was a work of transcendent merit. Though written in the early twilight of the Middle Ages and in inferior Latin, it at once took its place alongside of such classic productions as the [[Hippocratic Corpus#List of works of the Corpus|Aphorisms of Hippocrates]]. No secular work, indeed, ever met with more popular favor, nor infused its canons so radically into the dogmas of any science. It was for ages the medical Bible of all Western Europe, and held undisputed sway over the teachings of its schools, next to the writings of [[Hippocrates]] and [[Galen]]".&lt;ref name="ordrss" /&gt;

==Work on mental health==
Ordronaux developed an interest in mental health and between 1872 and 1882 he was a member of the [[New York State Commission in Lunacy]] writing two books on the subject.&lt;ref name="ordstatus"&gt;Ordronaux, J. The proper legal status of the insane &amp; feeble-minded. McDivitt, Campbell &amp; Co., 1875&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ordcommentaries"&gt;Ordronaux, J. Commentaries on the lunacy laws of New York. J. D. Parsons, Jr., 1878.&lt;/ref&gt; The second of these books mentions the opening of a ground breaking mental hospital and in his preface to the book he says, "The recent establishment of a department of Lunacy supervision by the State of New York, has turned public attention to it as a source for consultation, in the application of our [[Statutory law|Statute]] and [[Common law|Common Law]] to the legal relations of the insane......Insanity is a subject which touches our civil rights at so many different points, that it may be said to have a place in every problem involving human responsibility. It begins with man in the cradle, and follows him to the grave. It is often part of his physical heritage, and may become a qualifying element in all his civil acts. To collect and embody in one treatise the principles of law by which courts govern their adjudications in questions of mental incapacity, and to expound through commentaries both the philosophy of these decisions and the rules of procedure under which they are rendered, is the object aimed at in this manual of Lunacy practice".&lt;ref name="ordcommentaries" /&gt;

Ordronaux's activity as a Commissioner was frequently mentioned in the press. In 1875, he was called in to adjudicate whether a man, who was under sentence of death for murder, was insane.&lt;ref name="nytstaudermann"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; By 1882 his forward thinking and outspokenness had made him some enemies and in 1882 his salary of $4000 as [[Commissioner in Lunacy]] was temporarily opposed in debate in the finance committee of the [[New York State Senate]].&lt;ref name="nytsalary"&gt;

==U.S. Constitution==
Ordronaux's work on State law in New York led him to consider its relationship with Federal law, and in 1891&lt;ref name="nytfundamental"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; he published what may be his most important book, on the relationship between the powers of [[United States Congress|Congress]] and [[State legislature (United States)|State legislatures]].&lt;ref name="ordlegislation"&gt;Ordronaux, J. Constitutional legislation in the United States. T. &amp; J.W. Johnson, 1891.&lt;/ref&gt; About this book of more than 600 pages, Ordonaux said in the preface, "The accompanying work is an attempt to present in a concrete form the entire system of Federal and State legislation, as practised under a written Constitution in the United States. Its object is to expound those administrative powers which, in our dual form of representative government, are sovereign within their several spheres of action.....A written Constitution is a political grammar to whose rules administrative laws must conform, in order to give them judicial validity.....The government of forty four independent States, dwelling in harmonious relations under a supervisory Federal sovereignty, would seem, therefore, to justify the treatment of Legislation as a
department of jurisprudence meriting more textual consideration than it has yet received.....the present treatise has been prepared to meet the wants of those who, desiring to practise or interpret the canons of representative government in the United States, may seek to master the secrets of its architecture through a study of the labors of its founders, and to trace its genesis and development to a providential origin in the Spartan Commonwealths of our colonial period."

==Later life==
In 1898 Ordronaux wrote a biography of a Leonice Sampson Moulton,&lt;ref name="ordmoulton"&gt;Ordronaux, J. Memoir of Leonice Marston Sampson Moulton. C.A. Hack &amp; Son, printers, 1898.&lt;/ref&gt; a presumed relative of his foster father, possibly his foster mother.&lt;ref name="nytobit" /&gt; She was born in 1811 and descended from the original [[Mayflower]] [[List of passengers on the Mayflower|settlers]] to America. As Miss Sampson, she was sent on a secret mission to the US embassy in [[Buenos Aires]] to enquire into the sovereignty dispute between [[Great Britain]] and [[Argentina]] over the [[Falkland Islands]]. She is interesting according to Ordronaux for, among other things, keeping a very detailed diary which was far more comprehensive than the logs of the ships upon which she travelled.

On 27 June 1901 Ordronaux addressed the graduate students of The [[University of Vermont]].&lt;ref name="ordtuv"&gt;Ordronaux, J. Address delivered to the medical graduates of the University of Vermont. Free Press Association, 1901&lt;/ref&gt;  Reading like a tribute to his own life's work he  says, "A strange feeling possesses me as I rise to address you......I am here to perform, with much surprise to myself, the same duty which devolved upon me, on a similar occasion, thirty six years ago.......I stand in the presence of two distinct periods with all their differing and  startling results. In this long interval, too long to be measured by the standard of months, and falling more properly in the category of cycles, the drama of human society has moved with accelerated pace. A generation has acted its part of good and evil, then passed to its final account. Science, the industrial art,  Education, Commerce, Navigation, have all spread their wings as never before. Our country has added nine states to the framework of our Federal Union, and buttressed its [[Constitution]] with armor plated Amendments whose necessity had never been contemplated. Our very name, the United States, has changed its former significance and been adjudicated by our highest Appellate Tribunal to be no longer a plural substantive, but a noun in the singular number describing a nation of political equals, and not a league or partnership of States."

Ordronaux died of "[[apoplexy]]" at his home, Glen Head, in [[Roslyn, New York]] on 20 January 1908.&lt;ref name="nytobit" /&gt; His estate was initially valued at nearly $1,000,000.&lt;ref name="nytwill1" /&gt; A large part of his bequests were to hospitals, universities, churches and other public institutions. These included $30,000 to Dartmouth College and $10,000 each to [[Trinity College (Connecticut)|Trinity College]], [[Hartford, Connecticut]], The [[University of Vermont]] and the [[Episcopal Diocese of Long Island]].&lt;ref name="nytwill1" /&gt; However, the New York Times reported on 8 August 1908 that Ordronaux's total estate amounted to $2,757,000, the bulk of which was left to his three surviving sisters.&lt;ref name="ordwill2"&gt;

As of 2009, 2,600 former [[leprosy]] patients were living in 13 national sanatoriums and two private hospitals in [[Japan]]. Their mean age is 80. There were no newly diagnosed Japanese leprosy patients in 2005, but one in 2006, and one in 2007.

==History==

=== Ancient and medieval ages ===
*The route of leprosy into Japan has not been settled but the presence of '''leprosy in Japan''' at least in the Nara Era (710-784)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eonet.ne.jp/~libell/34-rekisi.htm#3&lt;/ref&gt; and the earliest record of leprosy in Korea at Cheju Island  in 1445 suggests that leprosy came from the south.&lt;ref&gt;Lew J A Korean Model for the Healing of Leprosy, 1971&lt;/ref&gt;
*In a collection of government documents titled "Ryounogige", written in 833, leprosy was described as the following: "It is caused by a parasite which eats five organs of the body. The eyebrows and eyelashes come off, and the nose is deformed. The disease brings hoarseness, and necessitates amputations of the fingers and toes.  Do not sleep with the patients, as the disease is transmittable to those nearby."&lt;ref&gt;Kikuchi I  Hansen's disease in Japan: a brief history Int J Dermatol 1997:36, 629-633.&lt;/ref&gt;
**This is the first document in the world that identifies leprosy as transmissible, since there had been no such documents in China.
**[[Kensuke Mitsuda]] thought that this was because of the frequent complication of scabies with leprosy, since scabies is easily transmitted.&lt;ref&gt;Mitsuda K  Coexistence of leprosy and scabies  Nihonkoushuuhokenkyoukai Zasshi 10:11, 1934&lt;/ref&gt;
*According to a [[legend]], [[Empress Komyo]] washed a leprosy patient in the 8th century.
*In medieval times, people with leprosy were discriminated against and lived separately from the main dwelling areas of the villages. This discrimination was bolstered by religion — one of the sutras of the Nichiren sect stated that "those who do not respect this sutra will get leprosy in the next stage of life."
*During the short period (1549–1611) when Catholic priests were allowed to preach Christianity, they built special hospitals where they treated leprosy patients. This came to an end when the Tokugawa Government enacted the death penalty for the crime of being a Catholic.
*[[Otani Yoshitsugu]] a famous samurai of the sengoku era also suffered from leprosy. It was said to be one of the factors that led to his defeat at the battle of [[Sekigahara]]

=== The Meiji Era (1868–1912) ===
*Japan reopened its doors to foreign countries in 1868, and the power went to the Emperor and the democratic government.  Checkpoints between provinces were abolished in 1871, and leprosy patients could also freely travel in the country.
*In the same year, leprosy patients began to line up on the road to Honmyoji, a noted temple in Kumamoto, Kyushu, Japan, for mercy.&lt;ref&gt;Kikuchi I Hansen's disease patients: responses to stigma and segreation in Kumamoto, Japan  Int J Dermatol 1994:33:142-145&lt;/ref&gt; The first national survey conducted in 1904 indicated that there were 30,359 patients, but because of the methodology, this figure may be vastly underestimated.

=== Christian missionaries and Japanese savers&lt;!-- citation needed --&gt; ===
*Japanese people were accustomed to seeing people with leprosy begging for money at temples and shrines or wherever people gathered, but this was a shocking event to Europeans.  Upon seeing a miserable 30-year-old woman abandoned near a watermill, Father Testevuide became determined to establish a facility for such people. In 1889, he started the Kohyama Fukusei Hospital. His example was followed by [[Kate Youngman]] in Tokyo, Miss Hannah Riddell and Father Corre in Kumamoto.
*In 1875, Dr. Masafumi Goto founded the Kihai Hospital in Tokyo which was specially designed to treat leprosy patients.  Dr. Goto and his son, Dr. Masanao Goto, became widely known for their balneotherapy for leprosy patients. At the request of the King of the Hawaiian Kingdom, Dr. Masasao Goto visited Hawaii and introduced their method. Most of Japanese doctors who established these facilities discontinued their activities after the start of public leprosy sanatoriums.

=== 1905 epoch-making meeting ===
{{main|Hannah Riddell}}
Hannah Riddell established the Kaishun Hospital in 1895 in Kumamoto and her activities are mentioned elsewhere.
Because of the Russo-Japanese war, she was in desperate financial straits because English people stopped sending money to her because of the risks that could occur during the sending process. An important meeting was held at the Banker's Club in Tokyo, both to save her and to discuss leprosy problems facing Japan. Various leaders, including those representing the government, statesmen, and journalists, attended the meeting.
The timing was good. The Japanese government had begun to take an interest in leprosy problems since they found many patients in the drafts for military service. To become strong militarily was their biggest concern at the time. The meeting was chaired by Viscount Shibuzawa, who was a leading businessman. At the meeting [[Kensuke Mitsuda]] stressed that leprosy was infectious.
Finally the Japanese government, spurred by the events of the 1905 meeting, promulgated the first leprosy prevention law in 1907 and started five public sanatoriums in 1909.&lt;!-- citation needed --&gt;

=== "No Leprosy Patients in Prefecture" Movement ===
{{Main|No Leprosy Patients in Our Prefecture Movement}}
{{further|Forced Hospitalization at Honmyoji}}
*At the start of public sanatoriums, only the wandering patients were hospitalized. However, as time went, people wanted their prefectures to be "purified," and the belief began that there should be no leprosy patients in their prefectures.
*This movement started around 1930 and it naturally worsened [[leprosy stigma]].  In Kumamoto, 157 patients living near Honmyoji were "arrested" and transferred to other sanatoriums. A patient received unjust procedures and was sentenced to death penalty.&lt;!-- citation needed --&gt;

=== War and leprosy ===
*In Japanese sanatoriums, in 1945, because of food shortage, many patients died of tuberculosis in mainland Japan with a rate of 20% at the worst leperosaria. In Okinawa, more than 25% of patients died in the sanatoriurm in the same year. In the Miyako Nanseien, Okinawa, the death rate was over 40% in 1945 and the cause of death was almost malaria. It was reported that in a psychiatric hospital in Tokyo (Tokyo Metropolitan Matsuzawa Boi), the death rate in 1945 was 40% &lt;ref&gt;Okada Y  The death rate of prewar day Tokyo Psychiatric Hospitals: in Kindai Shomin Seikatsushi, 5, Byouki, Eisei, San-Ichi Shobyou, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

*In other years, including all sanatoriums. [[Amami Wakoen Sanatorium]], [[Okinawa Airakuen Sanatorium]] and [[Miyako Nanseien Sanatorium]] are excluded.

=== The 1953 Leprosy Prevention Law and Patients' Struggle&lt;!-- this portion cites no source --&gt;===
*[[Kensuke Mitsuda]] stated before the Upper House in 1951 that all patients be hospitalized. This was a segregation policy and all patients were against it.  Some of them staged even hunger strikes, but the 1953 leprosy prevention law was passed; there were practically no changes from the strict 1931 leprosy prevention law.

=== The expressed view of the Japan Leprosy Association===
*Hiroshi Shima, Fujio Otani, Minoru Narita and Kunio Murakami were primary movers in the abolition of the Japan's Leprosy Prevention Law. It was delayed because the opinions of patient autonomy associations differed.

==== The statement of the Japanese Leprosy Association on the Leprosy Prevention Law ====
*It is said that the leprosy control method in Japan was greatly influenced by the First International Congress of Leprosy in 1897, at which it was concluded that isolation of patients was the best method of leprosy control. However, this did not mean indiscriminate isolation of patients.  The Interior Ministry of Japan replied to a question that "the salvation of wandering patients" be given priority, above that of prevention. Absolute isolation has been based on two views; 1) that leprosy occurs through intimate contact within the families in which any patients would be the source of infection, and 2) leprosy would be incurable for the rest of life.  Absolute isolation was supported by the social belief of that day; leprosy is a shameful disease and the purity (absence of leprosy patients) of the nation should be maintained, thus justifying isolation. Complete isolation was given priority rather than salvation of patients.
*In Japan, not a small number of patients had been found during the draft for military service. Between 1897 and 1937, leprosy patients found at the draft kept decreasing.  There were major national censuses between 1919 and 1935, during which the number of leprosy patients kept decreasing. Epidemiologically speaking, improvement in the living conditions has been given credit for this decrease, rather than the results of isolation. Japan was on its way to elimination of leprosy patients, irrespective of enforced isolation. In other words, statistically speaking, the present leprosy prevention law had not been necessary.
*Nevertheless, the 1953 revision of the leprosy prevention law was passed and enforced.  At that time, the effects of chemotherapy were apparent, and internationally, isolation has not been supported at the Rome Conference on rehabilitation.  Dapsone and rifampicin were put into service.  In 1982, the infectivity of Mycobacterium leprae was found to disappear within several doses of rifampicin, and a multidrug therapeutic regimen (MDT) was proposed. This has become the standard regimen for leprosy control. Recently new quinolones were added.
*Outpatient treatment has become possible even at the onset of the disease, and now we can treat patients with erythema nodosum leprosum and leprous neuritis without much difficulty.
*Although there have been mysteries left unsolved concerning leprosy, such as the mode of transmission or the relationship between infection and development of symptoms, there have been no reports suggesting leprosy is the beyond the concept of ordinary infections.
*Therefore, the present law lost its basis for existence; medically speaking, the law deserved to be abrogated.
*As late as 1955, 91 percent of leprosy patients were hospitalized in leprosaria. Outpatient treatment did become popular, but management of patients continued to be leprosarium-centered.  This does not go hand in hand with WHO, which aims at the coexistence of patients and society.  Therefore, we have been left far from the remainder of the world. *It cannot be denied that the isolation within the leprosaria has made those working at hospitals and universities lose interest in the treatment of leprosy.  The Japanese Leprosy Association deeply reflected on these matters.  However, they did not lead toward an abrogatin of the outdated law, they did not point out this failure of leprosy control, because those working in leprosaria occupied the central part of the association, and they let the law to exist to the present time.
*New leprosy patients should be treated on an outpatient basis, within the framework of the health insurance system.  Hansen's disease centers should be established and specialists be trained.
*We have no right to condemn our senior leprologists who advocated isolation under the banner of "salvation" of the patients. However, we must listen to and hear the pitiful cries of those who have been separated from their families because of leprosy stigma.  Reflections and self-criticisms are urgently needed.
*Leprosy control should be nothing but medical control.  It was our failure that we advocated isolation with a view to arousing public opinion, theirby stirring up the fear of leprosy in this country. The Japanese Leprosy Association and Japanese medical world need to reflect on this and recognize this fact again.

=== The trials ===
*The Zenkankyo (Patients' Union) staged a number of struggles against the Ministry of Welfare and they finally won the abolishment of the 1953 Leprosy Prevention Law in 1996. It was ruled that the law was unconstitutional between 1960 and 1996. During this period, the law should have not been present.&lt;ref&gt;Japan's leprosy prevention law to disappear  Kikuchi I The Star 54, 5, 10. 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, many patients sued the Government for compensation and they won it in 2001.

== Leprosy prevention law ==

===Leprosy Prevention Law of 1907===
*The patients who do not have supporting men and women shall be treated in public leprosaria. Those who have supporters shall be cared for by them.

===Leprosy Prevention Law of 1931===

== Life in the sanatoriums ==

===The present situation===
*There are about 2600 ex-patients in 13 national Hansen's disease sanatoriums and 2 private hospitals as of May 1, 2009. There are no active leprosy patients, and all are recovered or have after-effects of leprosy. Their mean age is 80. Because of sterilization and abortion, they do not have children. Many of them have disease of advanced ages or handicaps and aids are necessary. Some earnestly hope for social rehabilitation, but there are a very few who are active in society.
*Those in the sanatoriums enjoy life in or out of the sanatoriums; medical and living care are helped by doctors and health workers. Their families visit them in sanatoriums and vice versa. They may be treated in other medical facilities, if necessary.

=== Religions ===
*Every leprosy sanatorium in Japan has churches and Buddhist temples (there are no temples attached to sanatoria in Okinawa Prefecture), and it is true that patients had faith, though some patients stated that deciding on a religion was in preparation for their death in the leprosaria. In days gone by, they could not share the family graves, an instance of [[leprosy stigma]].  In Kikuchi Keifuen Leprosarium, statistics showed Buddhism A 757, B 85, C 89, D (Sokagakkai) 51, Shintoism A 11, Shintoism B 9, Catholic 51, Christianity 95, as of 1979.

=== Abortions and sterilization ===
*Since 1915, sterilization had been performed in public sanatoriums in Japan, since it was hard to bring up the babies born of patients in sanatoriums. Married life was permitted. Abortions were also performed. Because of this custom, patients did not have children.
*The Leprosy Prevention laws of 1907, 1931 and 1953, the last one only repealed in 1996, permitted the segregation of patients in sanitariums where forced abortions and sterilization were common, (even if the laws did not refer to it), and authorized punishment of patients "disturbing peace".
{{further|Eugenics in Japan}}

=== Recreations ===
*Hospitalized patients in prewar days were comparatively young, and they enjoyed sports and other kinds of recreations.

=== Literature ===
*Some patients wrote novels, and many patients composed Tanka and Haiku, a short poem.

=== Education ===
*Education in prewar days was unsatisfactory. Educated patients taught patients who needed education. In postwar days, branch schools of primary schools and secondary schools were made within the leprosariums. A high school was made for some time starting in 1955; 369 patients were enrolled and 307 patients graduated from the school.
*Education of children born of patients was insufficient. In Kumamoto, the enrollment of them into a primary school met social stigma or [[leprosy stigma]] in 1954 which was called the Tatsudaryo Incident or Kurokamikou Incident.

== Leprosy stigma ==
{{main|leprosy stigma}}
*Leprosy in Japan is characterized by considerable [[leprosy stigma]], by the Buddhistic concept of leprosy that leprosy is punishment and in modern times by three leprosy prevention laws requesting segregation.

'''Leumit Health Care Services''' ({{lang-he|לאומית שירותי בריאות}}, ''Leumit Sherutey Bri'ut'', lit. ''National Health Care Services'', formerly ''Kupat Holim Leumit'', lit. ''Leumit Sickness Fund'') is an [[Israel]]i HMO, founded in 1933 by the [[Revisionist Zionist]] Movement.

==History==
'''Leumit''' Health Fund ({{lang-he|לאומית}}) was established in 1933 in Dr. Yaakov Vinshal's kitchen in [[Tel Aviv]] - [[Israel]] by physicians who had been dismissed from their work in the General Health Fund ([[Clalit]]) at the time of the violent events following [[Arlosoroff]]'s murder. Dr. Vinshal's clinic was the first clinic to belong to the Fund, which has advanced a long way since then. 

In 1940 the poet Uri Tzvi Greenberg determined that the Fund's function is "to educate and to cure the bodies". [[Abba Ahimeir]] added: "The [[Jews]] must be taught to be healthy even when they are ill". Since then and to this day, Leumit Health Fund has been promoting health services and health education and providing the community with advanced medical services. 

Back in the 1930s, its founders determined that the uniqueness of the Leumit Health Fund would be expressed by offering its members the right to select the fund, physician and medical services of their choice - a uniqueness that has remained to this very day. 

The Fund's first manager, Mr. Melamedowitz, determined that the Fund would be open to everyone, and demanded that the employees and managers relate to the members of the Fund as acquaintances and not as numbers. The Fund indeed continues to pursue this path - a Fund whose doors are open to all residents of Israel, including new immigrants, city, [[kibbutz]] and settlement dwellers, the religious and ultra-religious, minority groups and secular Israelis.

==Today==
Leumit is one of the four health funds in [[Israel]] and  has about 700,000 members. Leumit operates more than 300 medical centers and 100 pharmacies nationwide.

'''Little Pine''' is a [[Veganism|vegan]] [[bistro]] located in the [[Silver Lake, Los Angeles|Silver Lake neighborhood]] of [[Los Angeles]], California.&lt;ref name="LA Times"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Zagat 2015"/&gt; It was founded by electronic musician and animal rights activist [[Moby]].&lt;ref name="LA Magazine"/&gt; The restaurant serves [[Organic food|organic]], vegan, [[Mediterranean cuisine|Mediterranean]]-inspired dishes and has a retail section with art and books, curated by Moby himself.&lt;ref name="Zagat 2015"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LA Magazine"/&gt; Moby's vision was to create a space that includes various aspects of society that he cares about. All of the restaurant's profits are donated to [[animal welfare]] organizations.

==Overview==
Little Pine opened on November 19, 2015 and is located in the Silver Lake neighborhood of Los Angeles, California.&lt;ref name="Variety"/&gt; Original plans for the restaurant to open in the summer of 2015 were delayed.&lt;ref name="Rodell 2015"/&gt; Moby opened the restaurant to create a space that encompasses various matters that he cares about, such as [[veganism]], [[organic food]], community, architecture and design.&lt;ref name="Little Pine"/&gt; Moby has stated that Little Pine was created to provide a "... compelling representation of veganism"&lt;ref name="The Hollywood Reporter 2015"/&gt; and to provide a space as "... an extension of our neighborhood and community."&lt;ref name="Broverman 2015"/&gt; 

The restaurant's decor has chandeliers and artistic murals created by various local artists,&lt;ref name="Zagat 2015"/&gt; and photographic works of nature created by [[Moby]].&lt;ref name="LA Magazine"/&gt;&lt;ref name="KCBS-TV-1"/&gt; The general decorum was designed by interior designer Tatum Kendrick.&lt;ref name="Rodell 2015"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Broverman 2015"/&gt; Little Pine is located in an [[Art Deco]]-style building that was built in the 1940s.&lt;ref name="LA Magazine"/&gt;&lt;ref name="InStyle.com 2015"/&gt; The restaurant has 58 seats.&lt;ref name="Kenney 2016"/&gt; Moby does not allow his own music to be played in the restaurant,&lt;ref name="InStyle.com 2015"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Barrera 2016"/&gt; and has been a vegan for 28 years.&lt;ref name="KCBS-TV-1"/&gt;

==Fare==
Little Pine purveys all plant-based, vegan dishes influenced by [[Mediterranean cuisine]]&lt;ref name="Zagat 2015"/&gt;&lt;ref name="KCBS-TV-1"/&gt; and influences of the cuisine, such as Italian, Spanish and French cuisines, as well as minor aspects of North African cuisine.&lt;ref name="LA Magazine"/&gt; Brunch dishes include French toast, lemon pancakes and biscuits and gravy.&lt;ref name="Zagat 2015"/&gt; Entrée dishes include stuffed [[Conchiglie|shells]], panko crusted piccata, and a parmesan spinach crêpe, among others.&lt;ref name="Zagat 2015"/&gt; &lt;ref name="Barrera 2016"/&gt; [[Organic wine]], various beers, tea and coffee are also served,&lt;ref name="Zagat 2015"/&gt; as well as [[Plant milk|almond milk]].&lt;ref name="Kenney 2016"/&gt; Food ingredients are sourced [[Local food|locally]] whenever possible.&lt;ref name="LA Magazine"/&gt;

==Charity==
Little Pine donates all of its profits to [[animal]] organizations.&lt;ref name="Stutz 2016"/&gt; Donations are given to [[The Humane Society]], [[PETA]], the [[Animal Legal Defense Fund]], [[Farm Sanctuary]] and [[Sea Shepherd Conservation Society|Sea Shepherd]], among others.&lt;ref name="Kenney 2016"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Stutz 2016"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Spin 2016"/&gt; The donations commenced when the restaurant began to break even&lt;ref name="Barrera 2016"/&gt; relative to its operating expenditures.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12252">'''Market information systems''' (otherwise known as '''market intelligence systems''', '''market information services''', or '''MIS''', and not to be confused with [[management information systems]]) are information systems used in gathering, analyzing and disseminating information about prices and other information relevant to farmers, animal rearers, traders, processors and others involved in handling agricultural products. Market information systems play an important role in agro-industrialisation and food [[supply chain]]s. With the advance of [[Information and communication technologies for development]] (ICTs) in developing countries, the income- generation opportunities offered by market information systems have been sought by international development organizations, [[non-governmental organization]]s (NGOs) and businesses alike.

==Types of market information systems==
There is a wide variety of market information systems or services. [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]] countries have traditionally emphasised the importance of information provision for the agricultural sector, a notable example being the service provided by the [[United States Department of Agriculture]] (USDA). Such systems are widely used in order to increase the transparency and the volume of information flowing through the supply chains for different agricultural products. The ability of market information systems to provide a valuable service was strengthened with the development of the Internet and the advance of electronic commerce ([[business-to-business]] (B2B), [[consumer-to-consumer]], etc.). Industry structure, product complexity and the demanding nature of agricultural transactions are considered determining factors for the development of B2B [[electronic commerce]] in agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;Leroux, Wortman Jr, and Mathias [http://www.ifama.org/tamu/iama/members/articles/v4i2/205-218.pdf Dominant Factors Impacting the Development of Business-to-Business (B2B)] e-Commerce in Agriculture&lt;/ref&gt;

==Agricultural market information in developing countries==
In developing countries, market information initiatives are often part of broader interventions and part of the [[Agricultural Marketing|agricultural marketing]] and [[agribusiness]] development strategy that many governments are actively engaged in. It is commonly understood that long transaction chains, lack of transparency, lack of standards, and insufficient access to markets for products has perpetuated low incomes in predominantly agrarian economies. Early attempts at market information provision in developing countries involved government bodies in collecting price information, and arranging for this to be disseminated via newspapers and radio stations. The information provided was often not very accurate and usually reached farmers too late to be of practical use. Governments often attempted to cover far too many locations and many services either collapsed after initial donor assistance came to an end or managed to struggle along with little impact.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew W. Shepherd, [ftp://ftp.fao.org/docrep/fao/003/x6993e/x6993e01.pdf Market Information Services: Theory and Practice], FAO, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Building Agricultural Market Information Systems: A literature review|last=FAO|first=|publisher=FAO|year=2017|isbn=978-92-5-109738-0|location=Rome|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;Furthermore, it was soon recognised that it was not enough just to supply market information to farmers. They needed assistance in understanding how to use that information.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew W. Shepherd,  [ftp://ftp.fao.org/docrep/fao/012/x8826e/x8826e00.pdf Understanding and Using Market Information.] FAO, Rome, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; However, donor organizations, such as [[Food and Agriculture Organization|FAO]], [[Technical Centre for Agricultural and Rural Cooperation ACP-EU (CTA)|CTA]], [[International Institute for Communication and Development|IICD]], [[USAID]], [[DFID]], and the [[Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation]], remain committed to improving the efficiencies within the supply chain through greater information provision. The recent surge of [[mobile phone]] usage in developing countries has provided an opportunity for innovative projects to leverage this new distribution channel to get critical market data into the hands of farmers and traders, taking advantage of the [[Short Message Service|SMS]] capacity of phones. Using the so-called "push" method recipients of information are identified on a database and automatically receive messages of relevance to them. Alternatively, the "pull" method enables farmers and traders to interrogate the database of the MIS. A farmer can send an SMS with the product and location he is interested in (e.g. tomatoes;Nairobi) and receive an immediate reply. Several projects by [[Reuters]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reutersmarketlight.com/ Reuters Market Light, India]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nokia]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nokia.com/NOKIA_COM_1/Microsites/Entry_Event/Materials/Nokia_Life_Tools_datasheet.pdf Nokia's Life Tools]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Esoko]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esoko.com Esoko]&lt;/ref&gt; KACE,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kace-kenya.com KACE Kenya]&lt;/ref&gt; Manobi,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.manobi.sn Manobi]&lt;/ref&gt; AgRisk&lt;ref&gt;[http://agrisk.in Agrisk]&lt;/ref&gt; and others have demonstrated the impact that such information can have. Amongst donors there is a renewed interest in promoting regional trade, particularly in Africa, and market information is seen as an important way of achieving this. Examples of donor-supported services are  [http://www.ratin.net/ RATIN] for East Africa and  [http://www.resimao.net RESIMAO] for West Africa.

Nevertheless, it remains unclear whether MIS can be delivered on a profitable basis by the private sector, given the difficulty of fully covering costs, or on a sustainable basis by the public sector, given the latter's history of gathering inaccurate data and disseminating it badly.&lt;ref&gt;ICT in Agriculture, Module 9, [http://www.ictinagriculture.org/sourcebook/module-9-strengthening-agricultural-marketing] World Bank, Washington D.C. 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shepherd|first1=Andrew|title=Assessing the quality of agricultural market information systems: A self-assessment guide|date=2018|publisher=FAO|location=Rome|isbn=978-92-5-130460-0|url=http://www.fao.org/documents/card/en/c/I8935EN|accessdate=24 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; To try to address some of these problems, a new approach makes the buyers responsible for uploading the price information via SMS, and facilitates trade by creating a capacity for sellers to contact individual buyers. Others question whether formal systems are still necessary when farmers can just contact traders by phone. Work in Bangladesh, India, China and Vietnam found that 80% of farmers now own cell phones and they use these to speak to multiple traders about prices and demand and to conclude deals.&lt;ref&gt;B.

The main aspects of [[maternal health]] are [[prenatal care]], [[post-natal care]], [[family planning]] and preconception.

The RBF scheme in [[Rwanda]] has led to massive improvement in the prenatal care in various provinces of the country.

===Institutional Delivery===

Institutional delivery helps to reduce [[infant mortality rate]]. According to [[UNICEF]], institutional delivery coverage is 69% in 2006-2010 in [[Rwanda]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unicef.org/infobycountry/rwanda_statistics.html|title=Statistics|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9884">The '''Medical Missionaries of Mary''' are a [[religious institute]] of the Catholic Church dedicated to providing health care to the underdeveloped regions of the world. They follow a [[Benedictine spirituality]], with its focus on life in community, shared prayer and hospitality.

Founded in Ireland in 1937 by [[Mother (religious title)|Mother]] [[Mary Martin (missionary)|Mary Martin]], they were originally dedicated to serve the missions in Africa. Today they serve in both North and South America as well&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Purcell|first=Mary|year=1987|title= To Africa with Love: Biography of Mother Mary Martin|publisher= Gill &amp; Macmillan|ISBN= 978-0-7171-1402-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Origins===
Martin grew up in an affluent home raised by her mother after the premature death of her father. Upon the outbreak of the First World War, Martin joined the Voluntary Aid Detachment, a division of the Red Cross, and helped with the nursing of wounded soldiers. After completing her period of service, she returned home to Ireland. There, she was inspired by [[the Reverend]] Thomas Roynane, a new [[curate]] assigned to her [[parish]], to serve as a [[missionary]] in China as part of the proposed new religious congregation of the [[Missionary Sisters of St. Columban]]. In the meanwhile, she was called upon to help in nursing victims of the [[Spanish flu]], which had begun to devastate populations around the world. To prepare for her missionary service, she went to England in January 1919 for further medical training. She was scheduled to undertake training in [[midwifery]] the following year. Her mother's severe illness prevented her from taking that training, however, as she had to return home to care for her.&lt;ref name=MIM&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.medicalmissionariesofmary.com/images/stories/pdf2010/a%20dream%20to%20follow.pdf|last=Smyth|first=Isabelle, M.M.M., Sister| title=A Dream to Follow|work=Medical Missionaries of Mary | accessdate=17 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By chance, [[Joseph Shanahan]], C.S.Sp., a member of the missionary [[Holy Ghost Fathers]], had just been named [[Vicar Apostolic]] for the new [[Vicariate Apostolic of Southern Nigeria]], then still a British colony. He received permission to recruit among the [[secular clergy]] to serve there on contracts of five-years duration. Roynane received permission from his own bishop to volunteer for this work.&lt;ref name=MIM /&gt;
 
In April 1920, Roynane arranged for Martin to meet the new [[bishop (Catholic Church)|bishop]], and she volunteered her services as a lay missionary to work in his jurisdiction. She advised him that she was about to commence training as a midwife. Agnes Ryan, another initial candidate for the Columban Sisters and by now in her fourth year of medical training, advised Martin that she wished to join her in the African mission. She completed that training in February 1921.&lt;ref name=MIM /&gt;

===Africa===
In April of that same year, Martin left Ireland for Nigeria, with Ryan, who had left her studies. They set sail for Africa from [[Liverpool]] on 25 May on the S.S. Elmina, a ship of the [[African Steamship Company]]. They arrived in the port of [[Calabar]] on 14 June. They arrived prepared to provide medical care, only to learn that they were expected to run a school which had been staffed by French Religious Sisters until two years prior. To give the parents and children of the school a sense of continuity, the two women were addressed as "Sisters" by the priests and treated as if they were already members of an established religious congregation.&lt;ref name=MIM /&gt;
 
By October, Ryan had contracted malaria and developed a heart condition, which required her return to Ireland. Forced to fill in as Acting Headmistress, Martin determined to confer directly with the bishop in his headquarters at [[Onitsha]], a journey of 100 miles (160 kilometers), for which she brought along three of the oldest girls at the school. Meeting with the bishop, Martin was advised that caution was needed in providing medical care to the people of her mission, so as not to provoke objections by other missionaries in the region. Further, before leaving Ireland, the bishop had organized a support group of Catholic mothers to provide assistance to the missions, of which Martin's own mother had become the president. They agreed that a religious congregation was needed to meet the needs of the mission. Upon her return to Calabar, Martin made a 30-day-long [[retreat (spiritual)|retreat]] following the [[Spiritual Exercises of Ignatius of Loyola]], in an effort to clarify where she was being led.&lt;ref name=MIM /&gt;

In April 1922 the bishop traveled there and held two weeks of consultations with Martin, Roynane and another missioner, during which the Rule and Constitutions of a new congregation were hammered out, with the understanding that Martin would be the foundress. Martin was not to see the bishop again for two years. During this time she learned that the bishop was working to establish the new congregation in Ireland, a direction she felt would focus the congregation on teaching rather than the medical care to which she felt called. An [[Religious Sisters of Charity|Irish Sister of Charity]], Sister Magdalen Walker, was released from her congregation to help in this new work. She arrived in Calabar in October 1923. The following January Martin was directed by the bishop to return to Ireland to make a [[novitiate]] period which would be recognized under new [[canon law (Catholic Church)|Church law]]. In March she joined Agnes Ryan, another volunteer at the mission, Elizabeth Ryan, and an American candidate, Veronica Hasson, as they started their time of postulancy, prior to admission to the novitiate year. After 18 months, however, upon completion of the novitiate year she left the community, as the training provided by the [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] Sisters providing their formation had not been oriented toward medical care.&lt;ref name=MIM /&gt;

===New paths===
In this formal step of forming the new congregation, Martin had encountered the prohibition in the new [[Code of Canon Law of 1917]] of the Catholic Church against members of religious orders practicing medicine. Facing this barrier, Martin still felt a call to consecrated life and considered following the example of the recently [[canonization|canonized]] [[Carmelite]] [[nun]], [[Thérèse of Lisieux]] (coincidentally also bearing the family name of Martin). In 1927 she applied to the [[monastery]] of that Order in Dublin, but her application was declined, solely on the decision of the [[prioress]] who overrode a unanimous vote by community, feeling that Martin was called to a different path in life. She then went through a new period of confusion until she was requested to consider again serving the missions. She then formed a small group of women to provide the domestic service for the preparatory school run by the [[Order of St. Benedictine|Benedictine]] [[monk]]s of [[Glenstal Abbey]].&lt;ref name=MIM /&gt;
 
Following a long period of illness in 1932, the following year Martin approached the new [[Apostolic Nuncio]] to Ireland, [[Archbishop]] [[Paschal Robinson]], O.F.M. The nuncio was supportive of her goals and encouraged her continually over the next years. Finally, in February 1936, the [[Holy See]] lifted prohibition against Religious Sisters serving as doctors or midwives. Martin then sought a diocese which would accept a new congregation, without success. In October of that same year, Robinson's former secretary, [[Antonio Riberi]], was named [[Apostolic Delegate]] in Africa, based in Kenya. He gave his support to having the congregation established in Calabar, which at that time was under a new Vicar Apostolic, [[James Moynagh]], [[St. Patrick's Missionary Society|S.P.S.]], whose own sister was a member of the new community.

===Foundation===
While still negotiating to purchase a house in Ireland to serve as a local base there—which  complicated by the fact that they were not yet a formal congregation—the small community sailed for Nigeria at the end of 1936. Upon their arrival Martin suffered a heart attack and was hospitalized at [[Port Harcourt]]. It was there that she was allowed to profess [[religious vows]] on 4 April 1937. With that the Medical Missionaries of Mary became formally established as a congregation.

==Current status==

===Religious Sisters===
Today the Medical Missionaries of Mary number some 400 women from 20 countries, who serve in 14 different countries around the world. These are: Ireland, England, Angola, Benin, Kenya, Malawi, Nigeria, Rwanda, South Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda, Brazil, Honduras and the United States. The Sisters and are trained in a variety of health-related professions. Their special concern is the care of the medical needs of mothers and children and the fostering of family life.&lt;ref name=MM&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medicalmissionariesofmary.com/ |work=Medical Missionaries of Mary |title=Welcome to the international website of the Medical Missionaries of Mary |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120627230019/http://www.medicalmissionariesofmary.com/ |archivedate=2012-06-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Associate members===
As well as sisters with lifelong [[religious vows]], there are about 100 associate members, both men and women, who feel drawn to the spirituality of the congregation and to apply its values in their daily lives, making an annual covenant to live it out in their daily lives. MMM associates can be found  in 12 different countries.&lt;ref name=MM /&gt;

'''Medical transcription''', also known as '''MT''', is an [[allied health professions|allied health profession]] dealing with the process of transcribing voice-recorded medical reports that are dictated by physicians, nurses and other healthcare practitioners. Medical reports can be voice files, notes taken during a lecture, or other spoken material. These are dictated over the phone or uploaded digitally via the Internet or through smart phone apps.

== History ==
Medical records have been kept since humans began writing, as attested by ancient cave writings. Medical transcription as it is currently known has existed since the beginning of the 20th century, when standardization of medical data became critical to research.&lt;ref&gt;"From papyrus to the electronic tablet: a brief history of the clinical medical record with lessons for the digital age" Am J Med. 2013 Oct;126(10):853-7. do: 10.1016/j.amjmed.2013.03.024&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lauren Kassell (ed.), with Michael Hawkins, Robert Alley and John Young, "History of medical record-keeping", Casebooks Project, http://www.magicandmedicine.hps.cam.ac.uk/on-astrological-medicine/further-reading/history-of-medical-record-keeping, accessed 2015-10-12.&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, medical stenographers replaced physicians as the recorders of medical information, taking doctors' dictation in shorthand. With the creation of audio recording devices, it became possible for physicians and their transcriptions to work asynchronously, thus beginning the profession of healthcare documentation as we currently know it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ahdionline.org/VisitorCenter/MTsPartnersInMedicalCommunication/tabid/242/Default.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-10-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006143848/http://www.ahdionline.org/VisitorCenter/MTsPartnersInMedicalCommunication/tabid/242/Default.aspx |archivedate=2014-10-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the years, transcription equipment has changed from manual [[typewriter]]s to [[electric typewriter]]s to word processors to computers and from plastic disks and magnetic belts to cassettes and endless loops and digital recordings. Today, speech recognition (SR), also known as continuous speech recognition (CSR), is increasingly being used, with medical transcriptions and or "editors" providing supplemental editorial services, although there are occasional instances where SR fully replaces the MT. Natural-language processing takes "automatic" transcription a step further, providing an interpretive function that speech recognition alone does not provide (although Ms do).

In the past, these medical reports consisted of very abbreviated handwritten notes that were added in the patient's file for interpretation by the primary physician responsible for the treatment. Ultimately, this mess of handwritten notes and typed reports were consolidated into a single patient file and physically stored along with thousands of other patient records in a wall of filing cabinets in the medical records department. Whenever the need arose to review the records of a specific patient, the patient's file would be retrieved from the filing cabinet and delivered to the requesting physician. To enhance this manual process, many medical record documents were produced in duplicate or triplicate by means of carbon copy.

In recent years, medical records have changed considerably. Although many physicians and hospitals still maintain paper records, there is a drive for electronic records.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Feste, L., "Electronic Signature – As it is Today", Journal of AHIMA (Chicago: AHIMA 1993), Vol. 64, No. 4, pp. 18-19.&lt;/ref&gt; Filing cabinets are giving way to desktop computers connected to powerful servers, where patient records are processed and archived digitally. This digital format allows for immediate remote access by any physician who is authorized to review the patient information. Reports are stored electronically and printed selectively as the need arises. Many MTs now utilize personal computers with electronic references and use the Internet not only for web resources but also as a working platform. Technology has gotten so sophisticated that MT services and MT departments work closely with programmers and information systems (IS) staff to stream in voice and accomplish seamless data transfers through network interfaces. In fact, many healthcare providers today are enjoying the benefits of handheld PCs or personal data assistants (PDAs) and are now utilizing software on them.

== Overview ==

Medical transcription is part of the healthcare industry that renders and edits doctor dictated reports, procedures, and notes in an electronic format in order to create files representing the treatment history of patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.totalmedtranscription.net/how-it-works/|title=How Medical Transcription Works|website=www.totalmedtranscription.net|language=en-US|access-date=2017-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Health practitioners dictate what they have done after performing procedures on patients and MT’s transcribe the oral dictation and/or edit reports that have gone through speech recognition software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Medical Transcription FAQ|url=https://www.canscribe.com/courses/medical-transcription-healthcare-documentation-course/#1501109162126-4e502843-3822708b-54b9f1e3-4d23}} by CanScribe Online Career College&lt;/ref&gt;

Pertinent up-to-date, confidential patient information is converted to a written text document by a medical transcriptionist (MT).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What Is Medical Transcription?|url=http://www.accesstranscription.com.au/what-is-medical-transcription/}}&lt;/ref&gt; This text may be printed and placed in the patient's record and/or retained only in its electronic format. Medical transcription can be performed by MTs who are employees in a [[hospital]] or who work at home as telecommuting employees for the [[hospital]]; by MTs working as telecommuting employees or independent contractors for an outsourced service that performs the work offsite under contract to a [[hospital]], clinic, physician group or other healthcare provider; or by MTs working directly for the providers of service (doctors or their group practices) either onsite or telecommuting as employees or contractors. Hospital facilities often prefer electronic storage of medical records due to the sheer volume of hospital patients and the accompanying paperwork. The electronic storage in their [[database]] gives immediate access to subsequent departments or providers regarding the patient's care to date, notation of previous or present medications, notification of [[allergy|allergies]], and establishes a history on the patient to facilitate [[healthcare]] delivery regardless of geographical distance or location.

The term transcript or "report" as it is more commonly called, is used as the name of the document (electronic or physical hard copy) which results from the medical transcription process, normally in reference to the healthcare professional's specific encounter with a patient on a specific date of service. This report is referred to by many as a "medical record". Each specific transcribed record or report, with its own specific date of service, is then merged and becomes part of the larger patient record commonly known as the patient's medical history. This record is often called the patient's chart in a hospital setting.

Medical transcription encompasses the MT, performing document typing and formatting functions according to an established criterion or format, transcribing the spoken word of the patient's care information into a written, easily readable form. MT requires correct spelling of all terms and words, (occasionally) correcting medical terminology or dictation errors. MTs also edit the transcribed documents, print or return the completed documents in a timely fashion. All transcription reports must comply with medico-legal concerns, policies and procedures, and laws under patient confidentiality.

In transcribing directly for a [[Physician|doctor]] or a group of [[physician]]s, there are specific formats and report types used, dependent on that doctor's speciality of practice, although history and physical exams or consults are mainly utilized. In most of the off-hospital sites, independent medical practices perform consultations as a second opinion, pre-surgical exams, and as IMEs (Independent Medical Examinations) for liability [[insurance]] or [[disability]] claims. Some private practice family doctors choose not to utilize a medical transcriptionist, preferring to keep their patient's records in a handwritten format, although this is not true of all family practitioners.

Currently, a growing number of medical providers send their dictation by digital voice files, utilizing a method of transcription called speech or voice recognition. Speech recognition is still a nascent technology that loses much in translation.&lt;ref&gt;"The Human Touch", by Elizabeth S. Roop, For the Record, Great Valley Publ. Co. Inc., July, 2015, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; For dictators to utilize the software, they must first train the program to recognize their spoken words. Dictation is read into the database and the program continuously "learns" the spoken words and phrases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medicaltranscriptionist.org/job-description/|title=Medical Transcriptionist Job Description|work=The Medical Transcriptionist}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Poor speech habits and other problems such as heavy foreign accents and mumbling complicate the process for both the MT and the recognition software. An MT can "flag" such a report as unintelligible, but the recognition software will transcribe the unintelligible word(s) from the existing database of "learned" language. The result is often a "word salad" or missing text. Thresholds can be set to reject a bad report and return it for standard dictation, but these settings are arbitrary. Below a set percentage rate, the word salad passes for actual dictation. The MT simultaneously listens, reads and "edits" the correct version. Every word must be confirmed in this process. The downside of the technology is when the time spent in this process cancels out the benefits. The quality of recognition can range from excellent to poor, with whole words and sentences missing from the report. Not infrequently, negative contractions and the word "not" is dropped altogether. These flaws trigger concerns that the present technology could have adverse effects on patient care. Control over quality can also be reduced when providers choose a server-based program from a vendor [[Application Service Provider]] (ASP).

Downward adjustments in MT pay rates for voice recognition are controversial. Understandably, a client will seek optimum savings to offset any net costs. Yet vendors that overstate the gains in productivity do harm to MTs paid by the line. Despite the new editing skills required of MTs, significant reductions in compensation for voice recognition have been reported. Reputable industry sources put the field average for increased productivity in the range of 30%-50%; yet this is still dependent on several other factors involved in the methodology. Metrics supplied by vendors that can be "used" in compensation decisions should be scientifically supported.

Operationally, speech recognition technology (SRT) is an interdependent, collaborative effort. It is a mistake to treat it as compatible with the same organizational paradigm as standard [[Dictation (exercise)|dictation]], a largely "[[:wikt:stand-alone|stand-alone]]" system. The new [[software]] supplants an MT's former ability to realize immediate time-savings from programming tools such as macros and other word/format expanders. Requests for client/vendor format corrections delay those savings. If remote MTs cancel each other out with disparate style choices, they and the recognition engine may be trapped in a seesaw battle over control. Voice recognition managers should take care to ensure that the impositions on MT autonomy are not so onerous as to outweigh its benefits.

Medical transcription is still the primary mechanism for a physician to clearly communicate with other healthcare providers who access the patient record, to advise them on the state of the patient's health and past/current treatment, and to assure continuity of care. More recently, following Federal and State Disability Act changes, a written report (IME) became a requirement for documentation of a medical bill or an application for Workers' Compensation (or continuation thereof) insurance benefits based on requirements of Federal and State agencies.

== As a profession ==

An individual who performs medical transcription is known as a ''medical transcriber'' (''MT'') or a ''Medical Language Specialist'' (''MLS''). The equipment used is called a ''medical transcriber,'' e.g., a cassette player with foot controls operated by the MT for report playback and transcription.

Education and training can be obtained through certificate or diploma programs, distance learning, and/or on-the-job training offered in some hospitals, although there are countries currently employing transcriptionists that require 18 months to 2 years of specialized MT training. Working in medical transcription leads to a mastery in medical terminology and editing, ability to listen and type simultaneously, utilization of playback controls on the transcriber (machine), and use of foot [[wikt: pedal|pedal]] to play and adjust dictations – all while maintaining a steady rhythm of execution. Medical transcription training normally includes coursework in medical terminology, anatomy, editing, grammar and punctuation, typing, medical record types and formats, and healthcare documentation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bestmedicaltranscriptiontraining.com/medical-transcription-training.html Medical Transcription Training Requirements], by Best Medical Transcription Training.com&lt;/ref&gt;

While medical transcription does not mandate registration or [[certification]], individual MTs may seek out registration/certification for personal or professional reasons. Obtaining a certificate from a medical transcription training program does not entitle an MT to use the title of Certified Medical Transcriptionist. A Certified Healthcare Documentation Specialist (CHDS) credential can be earned by passing a certification examination conducted solely by the Association for Healthcare Documentation Integrity (AHDI), formerly the American Association for Medical Transcription (AAMT), as the credentialing designation they created. AHDI also offers the credential of Registered Healthcare Documentation Specialist (RHDS). According to AHDI, RHDS is an entry-level credential while the CHDS is an advanced level. AHDI maintains a list of approved medical transcription schools.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090718204932/http://www.ahdionline.org/EducationTraining/Training/ApprovedMedicalTranscriptionEducationPrograms/tabid/251/Default.aspx Approved Medical Transcription Education Programs], by the Association for Healthcare Documentation Integrity&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, certified medical transcriptionists earn more than their non-certified counterparts. It is also notable that training through an educational program that is approved by AHDI will increase the chances of an MT getting certified and getting hired.

There is a great degree of internal debate about which training program best prepares an MT for industry work.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mtexchange.com/medical-transcription-exchange/mt-school-wars/ The MT school wars] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110617191300/http://www.mtexchange.com/medical-transcription-exchange/mt-school-wars/ |date=2011-06-17 }}, by the  MT Exchange&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, whether one has learned medical transcription from an online course,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.canscribe.com/ozescribe-answer-all-your-medical-transcription-questions/|title=Medical Transcription Training FAQ|work=CanScribe}}&lt;/ref&gt; community college, high school night course, or on-the-job training in a doctor's office or hospital, a knowledgeable MT is highly valued. In lieu of these AHDI certification credentials, MTs who can consistently and accurately transcribe multiple document work-types and return reports within a reasonable turnaround-time (TAT) are sought after. TATs set by the service provider or agreed to by the transcriptionist should be reasonable but consistent with the need to return the document to the patient's record in a timely manner.

While most medical transcription agencies prefer candidates with a minimum of one year experience, formal instruction is not a requirement, and there is no mandatory test. Some hospitals require nothing more than a diploma for employment as a medical transcriptionist. The average pay range for an in-house MT in a hospital setting is $8/hr.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://transcriptionology.com/?page_id=253 |title=Entry level medical transcription jobs « |publisher=Transcriptionology.com |date=2012-04-05 |accessdate=2013-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, MT/HDS can expect to receive anywhere from $12-$19 an hour, depending if they are working in a union or non-union environment. This large gap is because the job is based on production, so the more an MT can produce, the more they can make.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.canscribe.com/ozescribe-answer-all-your-medical-transcription-questions/ |title=CanScribe Career College FAQ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 7, 2006, the MT occupation became an eligible [[U.S. Department of Labor]] Apprenticeship, a 2-year program focusing on acute care facility (hospital) work. In May 2004, a pilot program for [[Vermont]] residents was initiated, with 737 applicants for only 20 classroom pilot-program openings. The objective was to train the applicants as MTs in a shorter time period. (See Vermont HITECH for pilot program established by the Federal Government Health and Human Services Commission).

== The medical transcription process ==

When the patient visits a doctor, the latter spends time with the former discussing his medical problems, including history and/or problems. The doctor performs a physical examination and may request various laboratory or diagnostic studies; will make a diagnosis or differential diagnoses, then decides on a plan of treatment for the patient, which is discussed and explained to the patient, with instructions provided. After the patient leaves the office, the doctor uses a voice-recording device to record the information about the patient encounter. This information may be recorded into a hand-held cassette recorder or into a regular telephone, dialed into a central server located in the hospital or transcription service office, which will 'hold' the report for the transcriptionist. This report is then accessed by a medical transcriptionist, it is clearly received as a voice file or cassette recording, who then listens to the dictation and transcribes it into the required format for the medical record, and of which this medical record is considered a legal document. The next time the patient visits the doctor, the doctor will call for the medical record or the patient's entire chart, which will contain all reports from previous encounters. The doctor can on occasion refill the patient's medications after seeing only the medical record, although doctors prefer to not refill prescriptions without seeing the patient to establish if anything has changed.

It is very important to have a properly formatted, edited, and reviewed medical transcription document. If a medical transcriptionist accidentally typed a wrong medication or the wrong diagnosis, the patient could be at risk if the doctor (or his designee) did not review the document for accuracy. Both the doctor and the medical transcriptionist play an important role to make sure the transcribed dictation is correct and accurate. The doctor should speak slowly and concisely, especially when dictating medications or details of diseases and conditions. The medical transcriptionist must possess hearing acuity, medical knowledge, and good reading comprehension in addition to checking references when in doubt.

However, some doctors do not review their transcribed reports for accuracy, and the computer attaches an electronic signature with the disclaimer that a report is "[[dictated but not read]]". This electronic signature is readily acceptable in a legal sense.&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Executive Message", JAAMT, Vol. 12, No. 6, November–December 1993. pp. 4-5. Modesto, CA.&lt;/ref&gt; The transcriptionist is bound to transcribe verbatim (exactly what is said) and make no changes, but has the option to flag any report inconsistencies. On some occasions, the doctors do not speak clearly, or voice files are garbled. Some doctors are, unfortunately, time-challenged and need to dictate their reports quickly (as in ER Reports). In addition, there are many regional or national accents and (mis)pronunciations of words the MT must contend with. It is imperative and a large part of the job of the Transcriptionist to look up the correct spelling of complex medical terms, medications, obvious dosage or dictation errors, and when in doubt should "flag" a report. A "flag" on a report requires the dictator (or his designee) to fill in a blank on a finished report, which has been returned to him, before it is considered complete. Transcriptionists are never, ever permitted to guess, or 'just put in anything' in a report transcription. Furthermore, medicine is constantly changing. New equipment, new medical devices, and new medications come on the market on a daily basis, and the Medical Transcriptionist needs to be creative and  to tenaciously research (quickly) to find these new words. An MT needs to have access to, or keep on memory, an up-to-date library to quickly facilitate the insertion of a correctly spelled device.

==Medical Transcription Editing==
Medical transcription editing is the process of listening to a voice-recorded file and comparing that to the transcribed report of that audio file, correcting errors as needed. Although speech recognition technology has become better at understanding human language, editing is still needed to ensure better accuracy. Medical transcription editing is also performed on medical reports transcribed by medical transcriptionists.

===Medical transcription editors===
Recent advances in speech recognition technology have shifted the job responsibilities of medical transcriptionists from not only transcribing but also editing. Editing has always been a part of the medical transcriptionist job, however now editing is a larger requirement as reports are more often being transcribed electronically. With different accents, articulations, and pronunciations, speech recognition technology can still have problems deciphering words. This is where the medical transcriptionist editor steps in. Medical transcription editors will compare and correct the transcribed file to the voice-recorded audio file. The job is similar to medical transcription as editing will use a foot pedal and the education and training requirements are mostly the same.

===Training/Education===
Education and training requirements for medical transcription editors is very similar to that of medical transcriptionists. Many medical transcription editors start out as medical transcriptionists and transition to editing. Several of the AHDI-approved medical transcription schools have seen the need for medical transcription editing training and have incorporated editing in their training programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bestmedicaltranscriptiontraining.com/school-chart.html|title=Medical Transcription Schools|work=bestmedicaltranscriptiontraining.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Quality training will be the key to your success as a  Medical Transcription / Healthcare Documentation Specialist. It is also very important to get work experience while training to ensure employers will be willing to hire freshly graduated students. Students who receive 'real world' training are much better suited for the medical transcription industry, than those who do not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.canscribe.com/courses/medical-transcription-healthcare-documentation-course/#1501109162126-4e502843-3822708b-54b9f1e3-4d23|title=CanScribe Career College}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Outsourcing of medical transcription ==
Due to the increasing demand to document medical records, countries have started to outsource the services of medical transcription.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://healthworkscollective.com/reimbursementmd/71961/future-medical-transcription|title=The Future of Medical Transcription|work=healthworkscollective.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The global medical transcription services market was valued at USD 41.4&amp;nbsp;Billion in 2012 and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 5.6% from 2013 to 2019, to reach an estimated value of USD 60.6&amp;nbsp;Billion in 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{url|http://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/pressrelease/medical-transcription-services-market.htm|Medical Transcription Services PRNewswire}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main reason for outsourcing is stated to be the cost advantage due to cheap labor in developing countries, and their currency rates as compared to the U.S. dollar. Drivers that Influence Outsourcing to Medical Transcription Partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hitechtranscriptionservices.com/newsroom/drivers-influence-outsourcing-medical-transcription.php|title=Drivers that Influence Outsourcing of Medical Transcription|author=Champak Pol|date=13 December 2013|work=Newsroom – Hi-Tech Transcription Services}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a volatile controversy on whether medical transcription work should be outsourced, mainly due to three reasons:

# The greater majority of MTs presently work from home offices rather than in hospitals, working off-site for "national" transcription services. It is predominantly those nationals located in the United States who are striving to outsource work to other-than-US-based transcriptionists. In outsourcing work to sometimes lesser-qualified and lower-paid non-US MTs, the nationals unfortunately can force US transcriptionists to accept lower rates, at the risk of losing business altogether to the cheaper outsourcing providers.&lt;ref&gt;The Toronto Star " How did we create such bleak job prospects for Canada’s youth?" By: Neil Sandell Special to the Star, Published on Fri Nov 30, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to the low line rates forced on US transcriptionists, US MTs are often paid as ICs ([[independent contractors]]); thus, the nationals save on employee insurance and benefits offered, etc.&lt;ref&gt;"Number Cruncher – Pawnshop chain emerges as small-cap gem", Shirley Won, The Globe and Mail, Thursday, Sep. 22, 2011 7:15 p.m. EDT&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately, for the state of healthcare-related administrative costs in the United States, in outsourcing, the nationals still charge the hospitals the same rate as they did in the past for highly qualified US transcriptionists but subcontract the work to non-US MTs, keeping the difference as profit.
# There are concerns about patient privacy,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/hospital-record-outsourcing-raises-privacy-safety-fears-1.1160193 Hospital-record outsourcing raises privacy, safety fears.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8949">'''Major General Neville Alexander Odartey-Wellington ''' (1934–1979), former Chief of Army Staff, [[Ghana Armed Forces]] (1978–79), was a [[Ghana Army]] officer. He was a native of [[Osu, Accra|Osu]], [[Accra]], and died in action leading loyal troops against revolting forces during the 4 June 1979 coup d'état in [[Ghana]].

== Military career ==
Described as a “soldier’s soldier”,&lt;ref&gt;Quantson, Kofi B. ''Ghana: Peace and Stability - Chapters from the Intelligence Sector''. Accra: Napascom, 2000, p. 316.&lt;/ref&gt; Major General Odartey-Wellington attended [[Accra Academy]] in [[Ghana]] and various military training institutions including the [[Royal Military Academy Sandhurst]] (RMAS), and the [[United States Army Infantry School]] ([[Fort Benning]], [[Atlanta, Georgia|Georgia]]). After being commissioned as an officer, he saw action in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congo]] during the [[Congo Crisis]], and also served in the Ghanaian [[UNIFIL]] contingent in the [[Middle East]].

Under the [[National Redemption Council]] (NRC) and [[Supreme Military Council (Ghana)|Supreme Military Council]] I (SMC I) governments led by General [[Ignatius Kutu Acheampong|I.K. Acheampong]], Odartey-Wellington served in various military command and civil administrative positions. He was Chief Executive of the Ghana Timber Marketing Board, Commissioner (Minister) of Health&lt;ref&gt;[https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/1975ACCRA06739_b.html "Three Original NRC Members Resign - 1975 October 15"], Public Library of US Diplomacy.&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequently Commissioner of Agriculture &lt;ref&gt;[http://mofa.gov.gh/site/?page_id=6713 "Former Heads of MoFA"], Ministry of Food &amp; Agriculture, Republic of Ghana.&lt;/ref&gt; tasked with implementing Acheampong's nationalistic "Operation Feed Yourself" program, before reverting to the position of Commander, No. 1 Infantry Brigade Group in 1977,.&lt;ref&gt;Tagoe, George. ''Genesis Four: A True Life Story''. Victoria BC: Trafford, 2003, pp. 79-81.&lt;/ref&gt; He is believed to have led the palace coup that removed General  Acheampong as Head of State in July 1978.&lt;ref&gt;Tagoe, ''Genesis Four'', 2003, p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt; In the reconstituted SMC regime or SMCII led by General [[Fred Akuffo|F.W.K. Akuffo]], Odartey-Wellington was promoted from brigadier to major general, and became Army Commander or Chief of Army Staff and thus, a member of the SMC's cabinet .&lt;ref&gt;Tagoe, ''Genesis Four'', 2003, p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gaf.mil.gh/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=category&amp;layout=blog&amp;id=41&amp;Itemid=77 "Past Chiefs of Army Staff"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130408100616/http://www.gaf.mil.gh/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=category&amp;layout=blog&amp;id=41&amp;Itemid=77 |date=2013-04-08 }}, Ghana Armed Forces.&lt;/ref&gt;. In his capacity as a cabinet member, Odartey-Wellington led the Ghanaian delegation to the General Debate of the thirty-third session of the UN General Assembly in October 1978, where, apart from delivering a blistering attack on the Ian Smith regime in what was then Rhodesia, as well as South Africa's apartheid policy and its occupation of Namibia, he reaffirmed Ghana’s commitment to Palestinian self-determination, including the option to establish an independent State.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/33/PV.26&lt;/ref&gt;

== Death ==

The SMCII commenced the transition to multi-party democratic rule, but was itself overthrown in a bloody coup on June 4, 1979, during which Major General Odartey-Wellington was killed while leading loyal troops.&lt;ref&gt;Tagoe, ''Genesis Four'', 2003, p. 153.; Quantson, Kofi B. ''Ghana: Peace and Stability'', 2000, p. 316. Lumsden, Paul D. "Towards Ghana’s Third Republic", ''Canadian Journal of African Studies'', Vol. 13 (3), 1980, p. 471.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.africa-confidential.com/special-report/id/26/What_will_Rawlings_do "What will Rawlings do?"] ''Africa Confidential'', June 1979.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the coup was successful, he was buried with full military honours by the new regime at the Ghana Military Cemetery in Osu.&lt;ref&gt;Hansen, Emmanuel, &amp; Paul Colins. "The Army, the State and the ‘Rawlings Revolution’ in Ghana", ''African Affairs'' (Lond), 79 (314), 1980, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; Major General Odartey-Wellington had previously foiled another coup on 15 May 1979. As Chief of Army Staff, Odartey-Wellington's death, coupled with the capitulation of Chief of Defence Staff Lieutenant General [[Joshua Hamidu]], compromised the ability of the SMCII to resist the June 4th revolt.&lt;ref&gt;Tagoe, ''Genesis Four'', 2003, pp. 153-159.&lt;/ref&gt; His colleagues subsequently surrendered and most of them were executed without due process by the new regime.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/node/631335 "Skeletons under the sand - National reconciliation in Ghana means disinterring old horrors"], ''The Economist'', 24 May 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; Ghana’s National Reconciliation Commission has highly commended  Odartey-Wellington for his sense of duty and “daring leadership”&lt;ref&gt;National Reconciliation Commission, Final Report (2004), Vol. 3, Ch. 2, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;  in trying to quell the revolt so as to safeguard the transition process. In September 1995, the Ghana Army commissioned the multi-million [[cedi]] Odartey-Wellington Tennis Court at the Army Officers' Mess in Accra in honour of the late Army Commander, who had been an avid tennis player.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sports Desk|title=Akafia Commissions Odartey-Wellington Tennis Court|work=Daily Graphic|date=21 September 1995|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Private life ==

Major General Odartey-Wellington was survived by his wife Comfort and five children: Comfort, Esther, Dorothy, Michael, and Felix.  Mrs Comfort Odartey-Wellington died in 1997 and was buried next to her  husband at the Military Cemetery in [[Osu, Accra|Osu]]. Odartey-Wellington's children have since been involved in high-profile clashes in the press with [[Jerry Rawlings]], the airman who led the 4 June 1979 coup that resulted in the killing of the former Army Commander.&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;Kwaku Sakyi-Addo, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/1011897.stm "Ghana's media feels election heat"], BBC News - Africa, 7 November 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Joy Online, [http://www.modernghana.com/news/10855/1/odartey-wellington-fires-salvo-on-presidents-comme.html "Odartey Wellington fires salvo on Presidents comments..."], Modern Ghana, 13 November 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.modernghana.com/news/191907/1/odartey-son-slaps-rawlings.html "Odartey Son Slaps Rawlings"], Modern Ghana, 24 November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mclglobal.com/History/Nov2000/17k2000/17k0r.html&lt;/ref&gt; One such clash culminated in the detention of Felix Odartey-Wellington by Ghana's [[Bureau of National Investigations]](BNI) in 2000 after he had described Rawlings as a "political conman" on national television.&lt;ref name=BBC /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/artikel.php?ID=11973 "TV Presenter Held For Criticizing President"], GhanaWeb, 7 November 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.modernghana.com/news/190870/1/why-army-chief-killed-rawlings-tells-story.html "Why Army Chief Killed.

'''Odontoma dysphagia syndrome''' (Bader syndrome) is a rare syndrome (&lt;10 cases reported to date) first described in 1967.&lt;ref name=Bader1967&gt;Bader G (1967) Odontomatosis (multiple odontomas). Oral Surg Oral Med OralPathol 23:770&lt;/ref&gt; The cause is not known but it is suspected to be genetic in origin.

==Clinical features==

This syndrome is characterized by clustering of teeth (compound odontoma, dysplasia and aplasia of teeth), slight craniofacial abnormalities, and [[dysphagia]]. The dysphagia may be due to an over growth of muscle tissue or strictures in the [[oesophagus]]. Benign tumors ([[odontoma]]s) may form at the roots of the teeth.

==Aetiology==

The cause is thought to be genetic and it may inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion.&lt;ref name="Schönberger1974"&gt;Schönberger W (1974) Multiple odontomas (Odontomatosis) and dysphagia in father and son-a syndromic connection? Z Kinderheilkd 117(2):101-108&lt;/ref&gt; A possible link to [[chromosome 11]] (11q13.3) a region that included [[fibroblast growth factor]]s 3 and 4 has been reported.&lt;ref name=Ziebart2012&gt;Ziebart T, Draenert FG, Galetzka D, Babaryka G, Schmidseder R, Wagner W, Bartsch O (2012) The original family revisited after 37 years: odontoma-dysphagia syndrome is most likely caused by a microduplication of chromosome 11q13.3, including the FGF3 and FGF4 genes.

'''Painkiller Jane''' is a fictional character, a [[comic book]] heroine created by [[Jimmy Palmiotti]] and [[Joe Quesada]] for [[Event Comics]] in 1995. Originally a five-issue mini-series, the character went on to star in numerous crossover titles with the likes of the [[Punisher]], [[Vampirella]], and [[Hellboy]].

After [[Event Comics|Event comics]], the character was exclusively written by Jimmy Palmiotti and drawn by various artists as it jumped from publisher to publisher. The series relaunched at [[Dynamite Entertainment]] with the first mini-series selling out. After that Icon- an independent label for creator owned work at [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]] comics, published two mini-series. The character then came back to '''PaperFilms'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;, a company owned by Jimmy Palmiotti and [[Amanda Conner]] where it is currently published. Painkiller Jane has been published all over the world in at least 8 languages to date. The comics have been the basis for a film and television series and is currently in development with [[Jessica Chastain]].

==Fictional character history==
{{Expand section|date=September 2008}}
Jane Vasko begins as an undercover police officer attempting to infiltrate the Fonti Mob. After gaining the trust of mob boss Joey Fonti, she is given the assignment of passing a message on to rival gang member Adam, not realizing that an explosive device has been planted on her. As she meets her target, the explosion causes significant injuries, but Adam is uninjured. Through mysterious means, he manages to revive Jane, giving her superhuman regenerative powers in the process. Leaving her life as a police officer behind, she becomes the vigilante Painkiller Jane.

The validity of this origin is unclear, as a completely different origin has been presented in the first Painkiller Jane miniseries, and the Dynamite Comics' miniseries contain references to both versions of the characters' origin.

==Powers and abilities==
Jane Vasko is virtually indestructible. With Jane's exceptional regenerative abilities, minor injuries heal in seconds, and do not even slow her down; more major ones tend to take a few minutes. She has recovered from multiple gunshot wounds, explosions, chemical weapons assault, axes buried in her spine, even a shotgun blast to the face (which simply knocked her off her feet for a bit). However, the healing power does not stop the injuries from hurting, which is where her new name came from. On the offensive side, she has no real powers except being a tough woman to kill. Other than that, she is a skilled fighter and master of undefined martial arts, as well as a master marksman with her weapons of choice; a pair of handguns.

The '''Pharmaceutical Society of New Zealand Incorporated''' is the professional body for [[New Zealand]] [[pharmacists]].

The [[headquarters]] of the Pharmaceutical Society is Level 10, Grand Arcade Tower, 16-20 Willis Street, [[Wellington]], [[New Zealand]].

Until the formation of the NZ Society in 1884, pharmacists in New Zealand were usually members of the British Pharmaceutical Society.   As a result, the practice of pharmacy (or 'chemist and druggist' as it was usually known at the time) in New Zealand was similar to British practice, and this has continued to be the case.

From 1884 until 2004, membership of the Society was a legally specified requirement for practice as a pharmacist in New Zealand, signified by the post-nominal letters, 'MPS' (Member of Pharmaceutical Society).  Membership was restricted to those who had passed the examinations, originally conducted by the Society and later by government operated Schools of Pharmacy, and then completed a period of practical training.

In 2004 pharmacy registration was transferred to a separate body with government-appointed members, the Pharmacy Council of New Zealand, and the Pharmacy Society (as it is often known) continued as a voluntary membership organisation representing pharmacists and seeking to advance pharmacy practice.

'''Polio Children''' is an international [[non-governmental organization]] which has fundraised over £1.3million to fund projects in India, Tanzania, South Sudan and Sierra Leone which enhance the welfare of children with [[poliomyelitis]].&lt;ref name="Department For International Development"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/closing-in-on-a-world-without-polio |title=Closing in on a world without polio |publisher=DFID |date=7 May 2014 |accessdate=30 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="British Polio: The Bulletin"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britishpolio.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/1339-BPF-Bulletin-V7-Final.pdf |title=Polio Children |publisher=British Polio |date=1 May 2015 |accessdate=9 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Asian News"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://asianlite.com/news/uk-news/touching-the-hearts-of-millions/ |title=Touching the hearts of millions |publisher=Asian Lite |date=2 April 2015 |accessdate=30 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rotary in London"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rotaryinlondon.org/blog/category/thanks-for-life-end-polio-now/ |title=Rotary Gets Proper Polio Credit |publisher=Rotary in London Blog |date=9 May 2014 |accessdate=4 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The charity has provided scholarships, vocational training and material assistance to polio victims across the world to ensure they can live dignified, independent lives.

==Origins==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Mayoor father founder Polio Children.png|thumb|left|x250px|Polio Children founder Vaghjibhai Patel]] --&gt;
In 1938, Vaghjibhai Ranchodbhai Patel, a 17-year-old son of a poor farmer in [[Gujarat, India]] completed his high school education. Yet despite passing with outstanding grades he was unable to pursue further studies because of his family’s poor economic situation.

However, he was determined that his children would not face the same fate and subsequently supported their education at any cost. The overriding message emitted by Vaghjibhai Patel that education is the only key to gain freedom from poverty was never far from the minds of his 3 sons. It was therefore no surprise that in late 2002 when Arun Patel, a polio sufferer himself, came across a newspaper article on a boarding school looking after poor and polio ridden children in Rajasthan, India, the three of them decided to visit to evaluate what help could be provided.

This first visit to the school (SKSN - Sucheta Kriplani Shiksha Niketan) left them with an overwhelming desire to help change the lives of those children for good. Hence, they immediately proceeded to set up Polio Children as a registered charity in the UK and the USA.
Since its formation in 2003, Polio Children, with the help of thousands of friends and well wishers from around the world has continued to work in partnership with its Indian and African counterparts to educate the poor and physically challenged children so they could all look forward to a life of hope and dignity.&lt;ref name="Polio Children History"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.poliochildren.org/content/our-history |title=Our History |publisher=Polio Children |date=4 June 2015 |accessdate=4 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Founding Trustees==

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Arun Patel speech.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Arun Patel speaking at the British Citizen Awards, 2015]] --&gt;
In addition to founding Polio Children and the OKAS Fund,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.okasfund.org |title=Old Kampala Alumni Scholarship Fund - Home |publisher=Okasfund.org |date= |accessdate=2016-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arun Patel is a trustee of the [[Isha Foundation]]. He is a retired chartered accountant and was a member of the [[ICAEW]].  He remains active with [[Rotary International]] through the Rotary Club of Dagenham in London.

Dr. Shirish Patel is also a founding trustee of Polio Children and the OKAS Fund. He obtained his medical degree from the [[Maharaja Sayajirao University of Baroda]], and is a member of the [[Royal College of Physicians]]. He is currently a Clinical Associate Professor at the [[University of Rochester]] specialising in psychiatry.

Mayoor Patel attended [[Marlborough College]] and the [[Chelsea College of Science and Technology]] before attaining his degree from [[Surrey University]]. As well as founding Polio Children and the OKAS Fund along with his brothers, Mayoor Patel is also on the National Advisory Council for Milapfest, an Indian Arts Development Trust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.milapfest.com |title=The UK's leading Indian Arts Development Trust |publisher=Milapfest |date= |accessdate=2016-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has also been involved with the Little Drops Shravana Project since 2007 (for the hearing impaired), a charity which aims to improve health and education in developing countries.&lt;ref name="Bolton News"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theboltonnews.co.uk/news/bolton/14183751.Bolton_man_who_helped_2_000_pupils_wins_national_award/ |title=Bolton man who helped 2,000 pupils wins national award |publisher=The Bolton News |date=6 January 2016 |accessdate=7 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===India===

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:SKSN Girls Vocational Training hostel.jpg|thumb|right|x150px|Construction of the Academic Training and Vocational Centre, 2004]] --&gt;
Polio Children work in partnership with the [[Indiability Foundation]] to support the Sucheta Kriplani Shiksha Niketan (SKSN) Institute in [[Jodhpur]], [[Rajasthan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sksn.org./sksn_partners/polio.html |title=Our Partners : Polio Children |publisher=Sksn.org. |date= |accessdate=2016-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since its inception in 1991 the SKSN institute has flourished from educating just 15 disabled boys into a boarding school now holding over 200 disabled and able-bodied boys and girls. Polio Children’s fundraising efforts, along with generous donations from other organisations around the world, have enabled the school to build a computer lab, a library and a prosthetics laboratory where, funds permitting, bespoke artificial limbs can be manufactured.

Polio Children's most significant contribution to SKSN was the construction of a girls hostel to provide accommodation for the female students of the school. The 140-bed Academic Training and Vocational Centre for Girls was opened in 2004 and enabled the school to enrol over three times as many female students who were previously unable to travel to classes each day.&lt;ref name="Polio Children"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://poliochildren.org/content/material-assistance/ |title=Material Assistance |publisher=Polio Children |accessdate=10 Dec 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Polio Children also fund a scholarship program allowing over 220 graduates to attend higher education institutions where they train to become doctors, engineers and teachers who often return to SKSN to teach the current crop of students.

Janak Singh, a previous student of SKSN who now teaches at the school, went on to represent India in the mini Para Olympic Games held in England in 2009. Despite suffering from polio, he won 5 gold medals for his outstanding cricketing ability.&lt;ref name="The Bolton News"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theboltonnews.co.uk/news/4729733.Disabled_Janak__17__gives_amazing_demonstration_of_his_cricket_skills/ |title=Disabled Janak, 17, gives amazing demonstration of his cricket skills |publisher=The Bolton News |date=10 November 2009 |accessdate=4 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Kitchen,_Kwa_Mkono,_Tanzania.jpg|thumb|right|x200px|Kitchen built in Kwa Mkono Polio Camp, Tanzania]]

===Tanzania===
Polio Children also works in partnership with the Kwa Mkono Disabled Children’s Trust to support the Kwa Mkono Disabled Children's Centre (formerly known as The Kwa Mkono Polio Hostel).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kwamkono.org.uk/home.aspx |title=Kwa Mkono Disabled Children's Trust &gt; Home |publisher=Kwamkono.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2016-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hostel offers rehabilitation, education and training to physically disabled young people which allows them to live independently when they leave.&lt;ref name="My Donate"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.btplc.com/mydonate/News/Tanzania |title=Treading for Tanzania - Bristol runner follows in father's footsteps |publisher=BT |date=13 September 2013 |accessdate=4 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Polio Children supports an ongoing education programme for the academically-abled hostel residents, and has donated agricultural vehicles to help cultivate nearby land for self-sufficiency, along with a Land Rover for transport. Funds have also been provided to improve the infrastructure and security of the hostel with a perimeter fence and extension of the common room. In 2016, Polio Children funded the building of a new kitchen at the camp with energy efficient, low emissions stoves installed to reduce indoor air pollution. A polio sufferer at the camp expressed her gratitude at the donation by saying
[[File:Makeni receiving food, Sierra Leone.jpg|thumb|right|x200px|Polio sufferers at Magbenteh Polio Camp, Makeni receive humanitarian donation, 2016]]

{{quote|"May God Bless those who initiated this idea of improving this kitchen. The cooking environment and facilities have improved a lot. We don't experience the intensive heat or blinding smoke like we did with the old stoves. It has also minimized our fire wood consumption making it much more efficient to cook a meal. Please send our sincere thanks to all who contributed to making this move possible."}}

===South Sudan===
Polio Children works with Building Minds in South Sudan (BMISS), a non-profit organisation that provides educational opportunities to villagers in the Republic of South Sudan. The organisation seeks to restore hope by providing an education for people adversely affected by conflict in Sudan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bmiss.org |title=Building Minds in South Sudan |publisher=Bmiss.org |date= |accessdate=2016-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sierra Leone===
Polio Children is working with the Magbenteh Polio Camp in [[Makeni]] to establish self-sustaining revenue generating projects. Despite the challenges presented by the ongoing Ebola crisis, in 2016 Polio Children contributed to the rehabilitation of the camp by donating cooking equipment and food.

===Kenya===
In 2016, Polio Children worked in partnership with the Olympia Wafula Foundation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.olympia-wafulafoundation.org |title=Olympia Wafula Foundation |publisher=olympia-wafulafoundation.org |date= |accessdate=2016-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; a charity established by paralympian [[Anne Wafula Strike]], which promotes social inclusion and empowerment of differently-abled and disadvantaged persons. Together they provided tricycles for polio sufferers living in remote areas of Kenya.

In November 2015, the UK Prime Minister [[David Cameron]] awarded Arun &amp; Mayoor Patel the [[Points of Light]] Award to recognise the positive impact the charity has had on polio afflicted children across the world. The Prime Minister said:

{{quote|"Arun and Mayoor Patel have seen first-hand the huge impact polio has on a child’s life and they have dedicated their lives to helping to overcome the difficulties they face. By making sure children with polio have the same chance of finishing their education as other children, and helping them to gain vocational skills, they make a huge difference in their lives. Over 1,000 children have received support and education through Polio Children, and I am delighted to recognise Arun and Mayoor as Points of Light for all that they have achieved."&lt;ref name="Points of Light"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pointsoflight.gov.uk/brothers-helping-children-with-polio/ |title=Brothers helping children with polio |publisher=Prime Ministers Office |date=13 November 2015 |accessdate=13 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rotary GBI2016"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rotarygbi.org/brothers-bring-hope-to-polio-victims/ |title=Brothers bring hope to polio victims |publisher=Rotary GBI2016 |date=19 November 2015 |accessdate=21 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''Rajiv Gandhi Jeevandayee Arogya Yojana''' (RGJAY) is a [[Universal health care]] scheme run by the [[Government of Maharashtra]] for the poor people of the [[Maharashtra|state of Maharashtra]] who holds one of the 4 cards issued by the government; Antyodaya card, Annapurna card, yellow ration card or orange ration card. The scheme was first launched in 8 districts of the Maharashtra state in July 2012 and then across all 35 districts of the state in November 2013. It provides free access to medical care in government empanelled 488 hospitals for 971 types of diseases, surgeries and therapies costing up to Rs.1,50,000 per year per family (Rs.2,50,000 only for [[renal transplant]]). As of 17 January 2016, around 11.81 lakh procedures amounting to Rs.1827 crore have been performed on patients from 7.13 lakh beneficiary families which includes over 7.27 lakh surgeries and therapies. The scheme is called successful amid some allegations of hospitals directly or indirectly causing patients to incur out-of-pockets expenses on some part of the treatment.

== History ==
In 1997, the then Chief Minister of Maharashtra [[Manohar Joshi]] started 'Jeevandayee Yojana' for the poor people which covered cost of treatment of very serious illnesses. But this scheme had shortcomings.&lt;ref name = FE &gt;{{cite web |title=RGJAY jay or parajay|url=http://archivehealthcare.financialexpress.com/strategy/1959-rgjay-jay-or-parajay|work=[[The Financial Express (India)]] |date=7 September 2013  |accessdate=18 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This scheme was used to cover only 4 procedures related to [[Neurological disorder|brain]], [[Cardiovascular disease|heart]], [[kidney disease|kidney]] and [[cancer]]. Also [[Rashtriya Swasthya Bima Yojana]] (RSBY) launched by the [[Government of India]] in 2008 had largely failed, while the [[Aarogyasri]] health insurance scheme of neighbouring [[Andra Pradesh]] state had become very successful. So the Maharashtra government closed the RSBY scheme, revamped the old 1997 'Jeevandayee Yojana' and modelled it on the 'Aarogyasri' scheme of the Andra Pradesh to cover 971 types of surgeries, therapies, procedures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title='Health scheme for poor a non-starter'|url=http://m.timesofindia.com/city/pune/Health-scheme-for-poor-a-non-starter/articleshow/37987711.cms|work=[[The Times of India]] |date=8 July 2014  |accessdate=18 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = TIMES &gt;{{cite web |title='RGJAY formulated after a lot of research' |url=http://m.timesofindia.com/city/nagpur/RGJAY-formulated-after-a-lot-of-research/articleshow/26118406.cms |work=[[The Times of India]] |date=21 November 2013  |accessdate=23 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was renamed as 'Rajiv Gandhi Jeevandayee Arogya Yojana' after the former Prime Minister [[Rajiv Gandhi]] and it was launched as pilot project on 2 July 2012 over eight districts of the Maharashtra state and it covered 52.37 lakh families. These districts were [[Mumbai]], [[Thane district|Thane]], [[Dhule district|Dhule]], [[Nanded district|Nanded]], [[Amravati district|Amravati]], [[Gadchiroli district|Gadchiroli]], [[Solapur district|Solapur]] and [[Raigad district|Raigad]]. Under this scheme, more than 1 lakh procedures were carried out between July 2012 and October 2013. Following the success of this pilot scheme, government of Maharashtra decided to launch this scheme in all 35 districts of the state.&lt;ref name = RGJAY &gt;{{cite web |title=Sonia Gandhi to roll out health scheme|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/mumbai/report-sonia-gandhi-to-roll-out-health-scheme-1921789|work=[[Daily News and Analysis]] |date=20 November 2013  |accessdate=17 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = TISS /&gt;

== Overview ==

=== Introduction ===
[[File:RGJAY 2.jpg|thumb|right|RGJAY information board in an empanelled hospital]]
The scheme was launched in all 35 districts of the Maharashtra on 21 November 2013 at [[Nagpur]] by the [[Indian National Congress]] president [[Sonia Gandhi]] in the presence of Maharashtra Chief Minister [[Prithviraj Chavan]],  Maharashtra Health Minister [[Suresh Shetty]], Union Agriculture Minister [[Sharad Pawar]], and others. The scheme now covers around 2.11 crore families from 35 districts of the Maharashtra state.&lt;ref name = RGJAY /&gt;

Under this scheme, Maharashtra govt pays insurance premium of Rs.333 plus taxes per year per one beneficiary family to the public sector [[National Insurance Company]] towards Rs.1,50,000 health insurance policy and the benefeciary family gets medical access for 971 surgeries, therapies and procedures in the government empanelled hospitals. The scheme covers pre-existing diseases and ailments. The scheme is launched on floater basis; that means a single member of family can get free medical access costing up to Rs.150,000 in one year or whole family can get free medical access costing up to Rs.150,000 in one year. [[Renal transplant]] is treated exceptional case and government offers up to Rs.250,000 per year for this operation.&lt;ref name = RGJAY /&gt;&lt;ref name=Jeevandayee&gt;{{cite web|title=Rajiv Gandhi Jeevandayee Arogya Yojana|url=https://www.jeevandayee.gov.in/RGJAY/|work=[[Government of Maharashtra]]|date=16 January 2016|accessdate=16 January 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160127080853/https://www.jeevandayee.gov.in/RGJAY/|archivedate=27 January 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Jeevandayee Arogya scheme to be extended to whole state|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/jeevandayee-arogya-scheme-to-be-extended-to-whole-state/|work=[[The Indian Express]] |date=14 May 2013  |accessdate=17 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2015 Maharashtra govt announced increase in limit on kidney transplant expenses from Rs 2.50 lakh to Rs 3 lakh which includes medical check-up of kidney donor and receiver. Govt also announced separate funds for poor patients to undergo [[dialysis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Amravati: State raises aid for kidney transplant under RGJAY to Rs 3 lakh |url=http://health.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/policy/amravati-state-raises-aid-for-kidney-transplant-under-rgjay-to-rs-3-lakh/50158323 |work=[[The Economic Times]] |date=13 December 2015 |accessdate=24 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The report further observed that in private hospitals, 63% beneficiaries were orange ration card holders and 37% beneficiaries were yellow ration card holders.&lt;ref name = TISS /&gt;&lt;ref name = TISS2 /&gt;

== System ==
[[File:Dr Ulhas Patil Medical College And Hospital 1.jpg|thumb|right|Dr. Ulhas Patil Medical College And Hospital at [[Jalgaon]] - one of the RGJAY empanelled network hospital]]
Maharashtra govt has formed 'Rajiv Gandhi Jeevandayee Arogya Yojana Society' (RGJAY Society) to implement and monitor this scheme in coordination with the National Insurance Company (NIC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=RGJAY Society - Rajiv Gandhi Jeevandayee Arogya Yojana|url=https://www.jeevandayee.gov.in/RGJAY/FrontServlet?requestType=CommonRH&amp;actionVal=RightFrame&amp;page=undefined%3E%3E%3Cb%3ERGJAY%20Society%3C/b%3E&amp;pageName=RGJAY_Society&amp;mainMenu=About&amp;subMenu=RGJAY-society |work=[[Government of Maharashtra]] |date=17 January 2016  |accessdate=17 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; RGJAY Society and NIC has identified eligible hospitals throughout the Maharashtra and has empanelled them to implement this scheme. As of January 2016, 488 hospitals are empanelled at 35 district places. NIC and RGJAY Society has connected all of these hospitals through a [[computer network]] with dedicated database of beneficiary families. These hospitals are referred as 'Network Hospitals'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Network Hospitals - Rajiv Gandhi Jeevandayee Arogya Yojana|url=https://www.jeevandayee.gov.in/RGJAY/FrontServlet?requestType=PublicViewsRH&amp;actionVal=AarogyasriView&amp;page=Network%20Hospitals&amp;%3E%3E%3CB%3ENetwork%20Hospitals%3C/B%3E&amp;mainMenu=Hospitals&amp;subMenu=Network%20Hospitals |work=[[Government of Maharashtra]] |date=17 January 2016  |accessdate=17 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The beneficiary patient can directly approach the network hospital. Or the patient can be referred to the network hospital by a doctor in nearby govt hospital (run by the [[District Councils of India|Zilla Parishad]]) or by a doctor in health camp.

=== Network hospital ===
[[File:RGJAY 4.jpg|thumb|right|RGJAY Aarogyamitra help center in one of the RGJAY empanelled network hospital]]
The govt has appointed 'Aarogyamitra' (Health Friend) in all network hospitals. This Aarogyamitra checks referral card, health card or any other necessary documents. If all documents are in order, the network hospital admits the patient and sends online pre-authorization request to the insurer NIC which can also be reviewed by the RGJAY Society. The preauthorization request is processed within 24 hours. In emergency cases, network hospital can give telephonic intimation to the NIC and approval can be granted immediately.

Once the patient is admitted, all expenses pertaining to the patient are borne by the hospital and thereafter the hospital sends bill to the insurer NIC for [[reimbursement]]. These expenses include bed charges in general ward, nursing and boarding charges, fees of doctors involved in the treatment ([[surgeon]]s, [[anaesthetist]]s, [[medical practitioner]] etc.), consultants fees, cost of [[anaesthesia]], blood bottles, [[oxygen]], [[operating theater]] charges, cost of surgical appliances, medicines and drugs, cost of [[prosthetic]] devices, [[implant (medicine)|implants]], [[X-Ray]] and [[diagnostic]] tests, food to inpatient, one side transport cost (from Hospital to residence of patient only by bus or railway. The scheme does not cover [[ambulance]] charges for transporting patient from home to hospital or from one hospital to another hospital.) etc. That means, the patient can walk in hospital without a single rupee in his pocket and come out after full treatment of his ailment without paying any money for anything related to his treatment. The insurer has identified 125 procedures for free follow-up consultation and medicine. If the illness of the patient falls under these 125 procedures, then the hospital also covers cost of follow-up consultation and free medicine for one year from the date of discharge of the patient.

[[National Accreditation Board for Hospitals &amp; Healthcare Providers|NABH]] audit of network hospitals is mandatory. Government hospitals which have A1 grade gets full reimbursement of expenses incurred on the patients. Other government hospitals which have grades below A1 receives more than 10% cuts in the refund.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Hospitals must have top grade to get full refund under RGJAY|url=http://m.timesofindia.com/city/nagpur/Hospitals-must-have-top-grade-to-get-full-refund-under-RGJAY/articleshow/47806926.cms|work=[[The Times of India]] |date=25 June 2015 |accessdate=14 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Health camp ===
The process of health camps organizations is coordinated by the RGJAY Society and NIC and MDIndia Healthcare seNices acts as the [[third-party administrator]]. The venue of the health camp is identified by the [[district collector]] (or by the additional commissioner in case of [[Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation|BMC]]). Thereafter district coordinator of NIC, TPA and district health officer organizes the health camp in consultation with the network hospital and the district collector. Local NGOs can also participate in the organization of health camp. Organization of health camp is publicised through newspaper advertisements, pamphlets, local cable network, public address system etc. At least 6 [[MBBS]] doctors - 3 male and 3 female - are required to attend the patients along with 10 Aarogyamitras (5 male and 5 female).

Objectives of the health camp includes identifying beneficiary families and creating awareness about the scheme among them, training generalist medical officers of primary health centers (PHCs) about 971 types of procedures so that they can refer the patients from PHCs to network hospitals after proper screening, training Aarogyamitras of PHCs about helping patients in proper documentary work etc. Basic amenities -like shade, fans, chairs, water, snacks etc. - are provided to the patients attending the camp.

Network hospital is required to carry screening equipments like [[stethoscope]], [[sphygmomanometer]], [[glucometer]], [[thermometer]], [[electrocardiography|ECG machine]], [[fundoscope]], [[pseudoscope]], [[Weighing scale|weigh machine]], height scale, [[otoscope]], [[tuning fork]] etc. Network hospital is also required to carry common drugs which includes [[ibuprofen]], [[paracetamol]], [[aspirin]], [[diclofenac sodium]], [[metronidazole]], [[albendazole]], [[norfloxacin]], [[ciprofloxacin]], [[ampicillin]], [[ranitidine]], [[B-complex]] etc. Doctors in health camp are required to carry out following investigations on the patients - [[hemogram]], [[Erythrocyte sedimentation rate|ESR]], [[blood sugar|BSL]], [[blood group]], [[X-ray microscope|routine microscopic X-ray]], [[fundoscopy]], [[otoscopy]], [[medical imaging|radiological]] ECG, [[Urine specific gravity|USG]], [[vision test]], [[hearing test]] etc.

After proper screening, if the illness of patient does not fall within 971 predefined procedures, then only free consultation is provided to the patient. If the illness falls within predefined 971 procedures, then free treatment and medicine is given to the patient in the health camp. If the patient can be treated only in the network hospital, then doctors give 'Health Camp Referral Card' to the patient which mentions all the details and date of appointment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Health Camp Policy|url=https://www.jeevandayee.gov.in/RGJAY/RGJAYDocuments/hcpolicy.pdf |work=[[Government of Maharashtra]] |date=2 July 2012 |accessdate=24 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Updates ==
In February 2016, it was reported that the Maharashtra govt has decided to remove 130 procedures and add new 270 procedures in the scheme when it will sign fresh [[Memorandum of understanding|MOU]] with the insurance company in November 2016. Senior citizens will be the focus of new amended scheme. Govt may modify criteria of 'minimum 30 beds' to accommodate smaller hospitals in the interior area of Maharashtra.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Jeevandayee to add 270 procedures, drop 130|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/news/jeevandayee-to-add-270-procedures-drop-130/article8213542.ece|work=[[The Hindu]] |date=9 February 2016 |accessdate=14 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The State Government of Maharashtra launched a health insurance scheme, Rajiv Gandhi Jeevandayee Arogya Yojana (RGJAY) on 2nd July 2012 in 8 districts of Maharashtra (Phase 1) and later on introduced to remaining 28 districts of Maharashtra (Phase 2). &lt;ref&gt;https://www.jeevandayee.gov.in/&lt;/ref&gt;The scheme is renamed as Mahatma Jyotiba Phule Jan Arogya Yojana from 1st April 2017.

== Grievances ==
Under this scheme, full treatment of the beneficiary patient is supposed to be free and cashless, but as per [[Tata Institute of Social Sciences]], 63% beneficiary patients had incurred out-of-pocket expenses for diagnostics, treatment or consumables. As per TISS, the reasons included lack of time to do paperwork, unawareness about the benefits of the scheme, lack of cooperation from the hospital staff etc. RGJAY Society denied this claim by stating that 6.62 lakh procedures were carried out, but only 6232 grievances were received which amounts to only 0.94%. The Society further said that out of 6232 grievances, 82.22% grievances were resolved. The Society has cancelled empanelment of 102 hospitals and 7 hospitals were suspended from the scheme.&lt;ref name = TISS /&gt;&lt;ref name =TISS2 &gt;{{cite web |title=Despite state-run mediclaim, 60% forced to pay cash: TISS - |url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2015-11-22/news/68484244_1_ration-card-private-hospitals-beneficiaries |work=[[The Economic Times]] |date=22 November 2015  |accessdate=17 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Regulation Focused Psychotherapy for Children (RFP-C)''' is a short-term, time-limited [[Psychodynamic psychotherapy|psychodynamic treatment]] approach for children with [[Disruptive behavior disorder|disruptive behavior disorders]], including [[oppositional defiant disorder]] (ODD), [[conduct disorder]] (CD), [[Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder|attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder]] (ADHD), and [[disruptive mood dysregulation disorder]] (DMDD). RFP-C consists of 16 individual [[play therapy]] sessions plus 4 sessions with the child’s caregiver(s) only. The basis for the therapeutic process in RFP-C is that all behavior has meaning and that some children engage in disruptive behaviors as a way to avoid experiencing painful or threatening emotions such as guilt, shame, and sadness.&lt;ref&gt;Tracy A. Prout, Emma Gaines, Lindsay E. Gerber, Timothy Rice &amp; Leon Hoffman (2015) The development of an evidence-based treatment: Regulation- Focused Psychotherapy for Children with externalising behaviours (RFP-C), Journal of Child Psychotherapy, 41:3, 255-271.&lt;/ref&gt;  RFP-C is an alternative to traditional [[Cognitive behavioral therapy|cognitive-behavioral strategies]] used in the treatment of disruptive behavior, which employ principles of [[behavior modification]] as tools to [[Behavior management|manage behavior]]. Instead, RFP-C is affect-oriented, and clinicians using RFP-C focus on understanding the child’s inner world and subjective experience and communicating this inner experience to the child in a developmentally appropriate way.&lt;ref&gt;Tracy A. Prout, Emma Gaines, Lindsay E. Gerber, Timothy Rice &amp; Leon Hoffman (2015) The development of an evidence-based treatment: Regulation- Focused Psychotherapy for Children with externalising behaviours (RFP-C), Journal of Child Psychotherapy, 41:3, 255-271.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rice, T. R., &amp; Hoffman, L. (2014). Defense mechanisms and implicit emotion regulation: A comparison of a psychodynamic construct with one from contemporary neuroscience. Journal of the American Psychoanalytic Association, 62(4), 693-708.&lt;/ref&gt;  RFP-C conceptualizes aggressive and antisocial behaviors as products of [[emotional dysregulation]]. The goals of the child sessions are to: (1) identify which of the child’s emotions are being avoided, (2) understand how the emotion is being avoided and (3) explore why the emotion is being avoided in a maladaptive way. The goals of the caregiver sessions are to (1) obtain clinical background information, (2) develop the therapeutic alliance, and (3) provide [[Psychoeducation|psycho-education]] to aid in caregivers’ understanding of the child’s difficulties. The ultimate goal of RFP-C is to help the caregiver and child understand that all behavior, even disruptive behavior, has meaning in the service of emotional and behavioral regulation. This insight leads to a decreased need to act on the distressing emotions (i.e. less need for disruptive behaviors) and an increased ability to tolerate, work through, and talk about the feelings that previously needed to be warded off.

RFP-C was codified in 2016 with the publication of the ''Manual Of Regulation-Focused Psychotherapy for Children (RFP-C) With Externalizing Behaviors: A Psychodynamic Approach''.&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman, L., Rice, T., (with Prout T.). (2016). Manual of regulation-focused psychotherapy for children (RFP-C) with externalizing behaviors: A psychodynamic approach. New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; An ongoing randomized clinical trial of RFP-C was launched by [[Yeshiva University]] in the [[The Bronx|Bronx]] in January 2017.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rfp-c.com&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3183">The '''Rotterdam Study''' is a prospective, population-based [[cohort study]]. The aim of the Rotterdam Study is to investigate factors that determine the occurrence of [[Cardiovascular disease|cardiovascular]], [[Neurology|neurological]], [[Ophthalmology|ophthalmological]], [[Endocrine system|endocrinological]], and [[Psychiatry|psychiatric]] diseases in elderly people.

The study was established in 1990 by professor Albert Hofman of the department Epidemiology &amp; Biostatistics at the [[Erasmus MC|Erasmus Medical Center]] in [[Rotterdam]], the [[Kingdom of the Netherlands|Netherlands]].
&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Inhabitants of [[Ommoord]], a suburb of Rotterdam, were invited to participate on a regular basis.

==Cohorts of the Rotterdam Study==

The Rotterdam Study comprises three cohorts.

The initial cohort (RS-I) started out in 1990 with 7,983 men and women aged 55 years and over.
Follow-up visits were held in 1994-1995, in 1997-1999, 2002–2004, and 2009-2011.

In 2000-2001 a second cohort was established (RS-II).
Another 3,011 inhabitants of Ommoord aged 55 years and over agreed to participate.
The participants of this second cohort visited the research center for a follow-up examinations in 2004-2005 and 2011-2012.

The third cohort of the Rotterdam Study (RS-III) started in 2006, this time with inhabitants aged 45 years and over. Inclusion ended in December 2008 and 3,932 participants have been included in this third cohort. The first follow-up examinations have started in 2012.

==Research center==

A typical examination at the Rotterdam Study includes an extensive standardized home interview and two visits to the research center for clinical examinations. Risk factors are measured at the research center, which is located in the middle of the district of Ommoord.

==Clinical follow-up==

Clinical outcomes are continuously monitored throughout the study period for all participants of the three cohorts. Data on morbidity and mortality are collected at general practitioners‘ practises and hospitals. Events are classified according to the [[ICD-10]] system.

==Publications==

[[File:Terre Tarentine.jpg|thumb|275.98x275.98px|Extra-virgin olive oil ''Terre Tarentine'']]
The extra-virgin olive oil '''''Terre Tarentine''''' is produced with the olive cultivars ''Leccino'' and ''Coratina'' and ''Ogliarola'' for, at least, 80%. They are mixed with other minor varieties of the local olive groves. It is recognised as [[Geographical indications and traditional specialities in the European Union|PDO product]].

== Origins ==
The cultivation of the olive tree in the western part of the [[Gulf of Taranto]] has been introduced by the Messapians during the 10th century b.C. and it has been improved by the Greeks and the Phoenicians. In the National Archeological Museum of Taranto it is possible to see some Greek amphorae with mythological scenes linked with the olive tree and its cultivation&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sviluppoagricolo.regione.puglia.it/index.php?page=progetti&amp;opz=display&amp;id=10|title=Portale Sviluppo Agricolo|website=sviluppoagricolo.regione.puglia.it|access-date=2018-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Geography ==
The extra-virgin olive oil ''Terre Tarentine'' is produced in the western area of the [[province of Taranto]] next to the border with [[Basilicata]] on the [[Ionian Sea|Ionian]] side of [[Apulia]]. This territory includes the municipalities of [[Taranto]], [[Ginosa]], [[Laterza]], [[Castellaneta]], [[Palagianello]], [[Palagiano]], [[Mottola]], [[Massafra]], [[Crispiano]], [[Statte]], [[Martina Franca]], [[Monteiasi]] and [[Montemesola]]. The soil is sandy mainly made of limestone&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.agraria.org/prodottitipici/oliodioliva-terretarentine.htm|title=Prodotti tipici italiani: Terre Tarentine DOP|last=www.agraria.org|website=www.agraria.org|language=it|access-date=2018-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Characteristics ==
The extra-virgin olive oil ''Terre Tarentine'' is  yellow with green shades. It has a fruity taste with some light bitter and spicy aroma. It is perfect for vegetables (raw or cooked) and for the second courses like meat and, above all, fish&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Renna|first=Massimiliano|last2=Rinaldi|first2=Vito Antonio|last3=Gonnella|first3=Maria|date=January 2015|title=The Mediterranean Diet between traditional foods and human health: The culinary example of Puglia (Southern Italy)|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijgfs.2014.12.001|journal=International Journal of Gastronomy and Food Science|volume=2|issue=2|pages=68|doi=10.1016/j.ijgfs.2014.12.001|issn=1878-450X|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. It is used for some traditional fish recipes like the ones with the [[Taranto#Mussels of Taranto|Mussels of Taranto]]. Despite the PDO recognisement for this extra-virgin olive oil, it is very hard to find and, as opposed to the other PDO extra-virgin olive oil of Apulia, a specific market is not  developed yet&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fosan.it/articolo/393_la_filiera_olivicolaolearia_pugliese_struttura_organizzazione_e_competitiv.html|title=La filiera olivicola-olearia pugliese: struttura, organizzazione e competitiv {{!}} FOSAN|website=www.fosan.it|language=it|access-date=2018-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1194">'''Trust Doctor''' or '''Trust Senior House Officer''' is a term applied to a [[Physician|doctor]] who is working in the [[National Health Service]] (NHS) in a non-training post, usually at [[senior house officer]] level. Doctors doing Trust Doctor jobs may subsequently secure an "approved post" and complete specialist training, but many others end up becoming [[Staff grade]] or Middle grade, career posts without specialist recognition. A survey by the [[British Medical Association]] showed that many of the doctors accepting Trust Doctor posts are from overseas who may settle for these posts despite having adequate qualifications, and concerns of exploitation have been raised.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bma.org.uk/ap.nsf/Content/jobadsbmjcareers BMA - Review of job advertisements in BMJ careers (February to May 2005)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "trust" derives from the fact that the doctor is contracted by the NHS trust rather than by the deanery that supervises local medical education.

The '''Upper Harz Ditches''' ({{lang-de|Oberharzer Gräben}}) are hillside [[Kunstgraben|ditches]], running roughly parallel to the [[contour lines]], that were laid out in the [[Upper Harz]] in [[Germany]] from the 16th to the 19th centuries to supply [[water power]] to the [[silver mines]] there. They are an important component of the [[Upper Harz Water Regale]], a historical water system that is now a [[listed building|cultural monument]].

== Design ==
The ditches consist of a trench and an [[Levee|embankment]] (''Grabenbrust'') next to it, made of spoil piled up when the ditch was excavated. The embankments are frequently protected from [[erosion]] by a [[dry stone wall]]. In most cases, they also act as inspection paths for the ditch keepers (''Grabenwärter'') and, today, as [[Right-of-way (transportation)|public footpath]]s. The ditches are only inclined at about 1–2&amp;nbsp;‰ (i.e. about 1 to 2 millimetres per metre). As a result, they run almost parallel to the contour lines of the terrain.

As protection against [[seepage]] the embankment and bed of the ditch are usually sealed with grass [[sods]] or [[clay]]. At inlets, where the ditch crosses forest streams, there are so-called ''Fehlschläge'', small [[weirs]], by which the water flow in the ditch can be regulated. When water levels are high these have to be opened, i.e. the boards controlling the flow must be removed.

The [[volumetric flow rate|hydraulic capacity]] of most ditches is between 100 and 200 litres per second; on the Rehberg Ditch it is up to 600&amp;nbsp;l/s and on the Dyke Ditch up to 1000&amp;nbsp;l/s.

The ditches are listed in an order which is based on the system by [[Preussag]], who named the ditches in an order based on the power stations that could be supplied by them. At present only those working ditches still operated by the ''[[Harzwasserwerke]]'' are shown.

A '''urine-diverting dry toilet''' ('''UDDT''') is a type of [[dry toilet]] with [[urine diversion]] that can be used to provide safe, affordable [[sanitation]] in a variety of contexts worldwide. Through the separate collection of [[Human feces|feces]] and [[urine]] without any flush water, many advantages can be realized, such as odor-free operation and pathogen reduction by drying. While dried feces and urine harvested from UDDTs can be and routinely are used in agriculture (respectively, as a soil amendment and nutrient-rich fertilizer—this practice being known as [[reuse of excreta]] in agriculture), many UDDTs installations do not apply any sort of recovery scheme. The UDDT is an example of a technology that can be used to achieve a [[sustainable sanitation]] system. This dry excreta management system (or "dry [[sanitation]]" system) is an alternative to [[pit latrine]]s and flush [[toilet]]s, especially where water is scarce, a connection to a [[sanitary sewer|sewer system]] and centralized [[wastewater treatment plant]] is not feasible or desired, [[fertilizer]] and [[soil conditioner]] are needed for agriculture, or [[groundwater pollution]] should be minimized.

There are several types of UDDTs: the single vault type which has only one feces vault; the double vault type which has two feces vaults that are used alternately; and the mobile or portable UDDTs, which are a variation of the single vault type and are commercially manufactured or homemade from simple materials. A UDDT can be configured as a sitting [[toilet]] (with a urine diversion pedestal or bench) or as a squatting toilet (with a urine diversion squatting pan). The most important design elements of the UDDT are: source separation of urine and feces; waterless operation; and ventilated vaults (also called "chambers") or removable containers for feces storage and treatment. If [[anal cleansing]] takes place with water (i.e., the users are "washers" rather than "wipers"), then this anal cleansing water must be drained separately and not be allowed to enter the feces vault.

Some type of dry cover material is usually added to the feces vault directly after each [[defecation]] event. The dry cover material may be ash, sawdust, soil, sand, dried leaves, mineral lime, compost, or dried and decomposed feces collected in a UDDT after prudent storage and treatment. The cover material serves to improve aesthetics, control flies, reduce odor and speed up the drying process.&lt;nowiki/&gt;{{TOC limit|3}}

Alternative names for UDDTs include "[[urine diversion]]" for the "UD" part (instead of "urine-diverting") in connection with terms like "dehydration", "dry", "drying", "desiccation" (for the second "D") which gives quite a high number of possible mutations of the terms that UDDT can stand for. The "T" always stands for toilet. These variations in wording place different emphasis on the amount of drying that takes place in the feces vaults. Probably the most advanced drying takes place in UDDTs that feature two vaults or in UDDTs that have a built-in electrical fan. As a general overarching term the adjective "dry" is better than "dehydration" as it applies to a larger range of UDDT types.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Rieck, C., von Münch, E., Hoffmann, H. (2012). [http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/874 Technology review of urine-diverting dry toilets (UDDTs) - Overview on design, management, maintenance and costs]. Deutsche Gesellschaft fuer Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH, Eschborn, Germany&lt;/ref&gt;

UDDTs are often considered synonymous with "ecosan toilets" ([[ecological sanitation]]) or with [[composting toilets]]. However, neither of these associations is correct. The term [[ecosan]] is in fact much broader and not limited to this type of [[toilet]]. Not all UDDTs are used in conjunction with the practice of [[Reuse of excreta|reusing excreta]]. There are also many other ecosan technologies that hygienically return nutrients to the food chain, such as [[Constructed wetland|subsurface artificial wetland]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s that produce fodder for cows. In addition, there is usually little composting taking place in the UDDT vaults (instead, it might be carried out in a secondary composting step which is external to the toilets).



Urine-diverting [[composting toilet]]s are similar to UDDTs in that they also collect urine and feces separately. Treatment is achieved through the [[composting]], a process quite different from pathogen removal by dehydration.

== Appropriateness ==
UDDTs are particularly suitable in the following situations:&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;
# Water is scarce or costly, such as in arid or semi-arid climates.
# Funds are limited. The cost of building or connecting to waterborne [[sewerage]] infrastructure may be particularly prohibitive if terrain is unfavourable or there are sprawling settlement patterns.
# Frequent flooding which impacts [[pit latrine]] and [[septic tank]] systems, resulting in leaky, inoperable toilet systems, foul smell, and water contamination.
# Unfavourable environment, such as unstable or rocky soil or a high water table, make it too expensive or difficult to dig for installation of pits, septic tanks, or sewer lines.
# [[Groundwater]] is the primary source of drinking water and is likely to be contaminated by pit latrines or septic tanks.
# Existing pit latrines are full and not being emptied and space for new pits is limited.
# Users seek indoor installations for greater comfort, accessibility and security, especially at night.
# Local agriculture and diminishing soil fertility create demand for affordable fertilizer and soil conditioner.
# Users want increased resilience in the face of possible natural disasters (e.g., climate change, earthquakes) or the lack of [[energy security]].
# Users seek to reduce their [[environmental footprint]] by reducing or eliminating [[Blackwater (waste)|blackwater]] and the need for a [[septic tank]], instead employing an on-site [[greywater treatment system]].

UDDTs can also be built for schools (many examples exist for example in Kenya, Rwanda and Uganda). However, these school UDDTs suffer from the same issues as any other type of school toilets: if clear responsibilities and a dedicated budget for the maintenance of school toilets is lacking, then the toilets may easily fall into disrepair, for example with blocked urine pipes or feces vaults that are not being emptied.&lt;ref name="susana.org2"&gt;{{cite web|last1=von Münch|first1=E.|last2=Ingle|first2=R.|title=Compilation of 25 case studies on sustainable sanitation projects by the Sustainable Sanitation Alliance from Africa|url=http://www.susana.org/en/resources/case-studies/details/1623|website=|publisher=Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH, German|accessdate=19 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Design considerations ==

=== Fundamentals ===
Urine diversion takes advantage of the anatomy of the human body, which excretes urine and feces separately. In a UDDT, the urine is kept separate and drained via a basin with a small hole near the front of the toilet bowl or squatting pan, while feces fall through a larger drop-hole at the rear. This separate collection&amp;nbsp;– or "source separation"&amp;nbsp;– does not require the user to change positions between urinating and defecating, although some care is needed to ensure the right position over the user interface. Female users may find that some urine may enter the fecal vault during normal operation. This is typically a small amount and does not significantly affect the functioning of the toilet.

The urine separation function can also be achieved by designing the toilet bowl in such a way as to take advantage of the [[Coandă effect]]. In this design, users must direct their urine stream against the interior walls of the bowl (usually assisted by a sloping front section) so that it can be collected via a small trough that is recessed into the base of the bowl.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

Designers and users of UDDTs should strive to keep the feces pile as dry as possible, as this is the most important factor in the prevention of odor and flies. During storage, the feces’ natural moisture slowly evaporates and exits via the vault’s ventilation system, or is absorbed by the dry cover material. This process is called [[drying]], dehydration or desiccation.

A UDDT consists of eight basic functional elements:&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;
# Urine diversion toilet seat or squatting pan
# If users carry out [[anal cleansing]] with water: An anal cleansing area with provision for the separate collection and drainage of anal cleansing water&amp;nbsp;
# One or two feces vaults (also called "chambers"; with or without removable containers), usually above ground, or one shallow pit for feces collection and storage; these must remain dry, protected from rain or runoff.

==== Storage and drying time for feces in the vaults ====
The impact of the storage time on the dryness of the feces varies with climatic conditions. A general recommendation that is applicable for all climates is that the storage duration for feces in double dehydration vaults should be at least six months, as measured from the last addition of fresh fecal matter to the vault.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

During the dehydration process moisture is evaporating from the feces and microbes are degrading the organic material. It is the dry conditions together with the storage time itself that lead to the decline of [[pathogens]] in the feces. The goal of the dehydration process is to exceed the pathogens' [[desiccation tolerance]] (or dryness tolerance) and therefore to significantly reduce their numbers and viability, for example with respect to [[helminth]] eggs which are responsible for causing [[helminthiasis|helminth infections]] in people in developing countries, particularly children.

Fresh feces consist of about 80% water and the majority of this water will evaporate away if it is allowed to do so by the feces not being enclosed in air-tight containers or vaults. The water content of dried feces after six months of drying is usually less than 25%.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Depending on the degree of drying and the intended reuse application an additional post-treatment step, such as composting, might be necessary for [[reuse of excreta]] in agriculture.

=== Bench design ===
UDDTs can also be built with a bench style toilet seat. This design has been standardised by the company Rotaria del Peru who have built by now 800 double vault bench UDDTs in and around Lima, Peru.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJmgtZK1dvM|title = Video by AKUT on Sustainable Sanitation in Peru|date = October 2014|accessdate = October 2014|website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of toilet has a wide, spacious bench or box, covering both feces chambers, into which two urine diversion toilet seats are integrated.

Users with disabilities can benefit from this kind of design as it is very sturdy (compared to a pedestal-type toilet). The wide bench provides space for an assistant if needed, and handrails can easily be fixed to the walls next to the toilet. Most importantly, this type of UDDT is accessible directly from the ground level and does not require access steps or ramps which are common for many UDDT designs.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{cite web|last1=von Münch|first1=E.|last2=Düring|first2=I.|title=Making sustainable sanitation inclusive for persons with disabilities—Factsheet|url=http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/1210|website=|publisher=Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH, Germany|accessdate=19 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Accessibility ===
Superstructures associated with UDDTs are sometimes built with steep, narrow stairs and without handrails. This design is not recommended as it can prevent users with disabilities from accessing the toilet. The needs of people with disabilities should always be considered in the design of sanitation systems, and in the case of elevated structures less steep stairs or ramps should be used instead. The aforementioned "bench design" can alleviate the need for stairs.

If a [[squat toilet|squatting toilet]] is built, it is useful to add handle bars for people who need support while squatting.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; For people with disabilities who need physical support while squatting, particularly when cleaning afterwards, a portable seat can be placed on the squat toilet to allow people to sit. When not needed, it can be moved out of the way.

=== Designs for flood prone areas ===
In flood prone locations feces containers or vaults should be located above the flood water levels. If this is not feasible, it is possible to use [[ferrocement]] walls to isolate the vault(s) from encroaching flood waters.

=== Source of UDDT components ===
The toilet bowls or squatting pans for UDDTs can be commercially manufactured from plastic or ceramic. Alternatively, they can be fabricated locally from cement or other materials by residents, local companies, NGOs or contractors. Stand-alone UDDT toilets made of plastic with or without built-in electrical fans are also commercially available.

=== Waterless urinals ===
Waterless [[urinal]]s are often installed alongside UDDTs for the convenience of male users. Urinals also reduce the risk that male users standing over the UDDT for urination (rather than sitting or squatting) inadvertently urinate into the feces vault or feces container. It is generally advisable that all UDDT users sit or squat to urinate. If urinals are provided, they can be used for those who prefer a standing position. [[Female urination device]]s are also available but they are not necessary for use with UDDTs as women normally sit or squat to urinate, a good posture which minimises urine from getting into the feces vault.

=== Sitting or squatting ===
UDDTs can be built as sitting or as squatting versions to accommodate the users' preference of [[defecation posture]]. Some people prefer squatting UDDTs in public places (thought to be more hygienic) but sitting UDDTs for households (thought to be more comfortable). It may be preferable to squat instead of sit for [[large intestine|colon]] health, although this is not specific for UDDTs but may refer to any type of [[squat toilet]].&lt;ref name="Sikirov"&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Sikirov|first1 = D.|title = Comparison of straining during defecation in three positions: results and implications for human health|journal = Digestive Diseases and Sciences|date = 2003|volume = 48|issue = 7|pages = 1201–5|pmid = 12870773}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Urban multi-storey buildings ===
[[File:Faeces collection (3010613152).jpg|thumb|Feces collection chutes are in the basement below the UDDTs in a multi-storey building in Erdos Eco-Town, China.]]
UDDTs with combined ventilation and collection systems can also be installed in urban multi-storey buildings but only one successful example of such a design exists: the Gebers collective housing estate in Orhem, Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;Syahril, S., Schlick, J., Klingel, F., Bracken, P., Werner, C. (2005). [http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/1216 Gebers collective housing project, Orhem, Sweden]. Gesellschaft für International Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH, Eschborn, Germany&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Example of Erdos Eco-Town Project, China ====
A much larger-scale installation which portrays the need to adhere to minimum design and installation standards existed in a project called the "Erdos Eco-Town Project" in Erdos located in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region of China.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rosemarin|first1=Arno|last2=McConville|first2=Jennifer|last3=Flores|first3=Amparo|last4=Qiang|first4=Zhu|title=The challenges of urban ecological sanitation : lessons from the Erdos eco-town project|date=2012|publisher=Practical Action Publishers|isbn=1853397687|pages=|url=http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/2103}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McConville, J., Rosemarin, A. (2012). [http://www.susana.org/en/resources/case-studies/details/1049 Urine diversion dry toilets and greywater system, Erdos City, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, China - Case study of sustainable sanitation projects]. [[Sustainable Sanitation Alliance]] (SuSanA)&lt;/ref&gt; The project was implemented during 2003–2009. This urban installation for 3000 residents in multi-storey buildings utilized UDDTs that shared ventilation and urine collection pipework and made use of chutes that extended down into basements for the collection of feces. The UDDT system was accompanied by [[greywater treatment]] facilities, solid waste [[composting]] and the reuse of these materials as a fertilizer in agriculture.

However, due to several problems related to improper design and installation, the lack of a cohesive plan to address these deficiencies and the resulting resident objections, the UDDTs were replaced by conventional flush toilets in 2009. The main reasons for why these UDDTs were replaced with flush toilets were:&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;
* Odor problems in the apartments produced serious objections amongst residents. Designing a properly working ventilation system for an extensive network of piping (urine pipes, ventilation pipes, fecal chutes) and accounting for factors such as high winds, open bathroom windows, and kitchen exhaust fans, required relatively complex engineering. Frozen ventilation pipes during the extremely cold winters of 2007 and 2008 caused odors from the feces bins to back up into the apartments contributing further to residents' displeasure.
* In such a large-scale UDDT system the plumbing pipework for the urine pipes and the ventilation system demand a relatively high level of engineering and construction, a standard not met by the builders.
* The standard of living in the Erdos area rose dramatically during the project time period. Also, water shortage (which had been a driver for [[dry toilet]]s) was no longer regarded as a problem since a pipeline was built to the Yellow River and deeper [[fossil water]] resources were extracted. Many residents viewed flush-toilets as the "gold-standard" in sanitation and dry toilets were considered as backward in a modern urban setting.
* A stakeholder education approach among residents focused on early participation and learning about the use and maintenance of the UDDTs was not possible since the residents arrived on the scene only after the apartments were already built. They also had no choice in deciding on the kind of toilet that they wanted to have.
* There was a lack of dedicated owners who felt responsible for solving maintenance issues. Once the design problems were identified, residents balked at covering the costs necessary to correct the problems with the existing system, particularly given their distrust of it. So, needing to resolve the issue quickly, the District Governor responded by investing in flush toilets instead.
If these lessons are taken into consideration, future large-scale UDDT installations in urban areas could succeed.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

== Types ==

=== Single vault ===
UDDTs with a single vault have interchangeable containers to collect the fecal material. Depending on the size of the vault, two or more containers can be stored inside. Containers should be limited to a maximum volume of approximately 50 litres, so that they still can be manually moved when they fill up. Once a container is full, it can be left for further dehydration or removed for further treatment. Removal of the container requires care due to fresh, potentially pathogen-loaded feces being on top of the pile in the container. Because of the limited ventilation within a plastic bucket, such single-vault UDDTs may not reduce the pathogen load as effectively as double-vault UDDTs.&lt;ref name="canaday" /&gt; Therefore, a post-treatment of the fecal material is usually required. This can be achieved through further dehydration, composting processes or heat treatments.

On the other hand, if the container is made from a material that has a high permeability with air, such as woven sacks or baskets, then the drying performance in single vault UDDTs may be similar to that of double vault UDDTs.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== Double vault ===
Double-vault UDDTs are alternatively called twin-vault, two-vault or two-chambered UDDTs. In double-vault UDDTs, the fecal material dehydrates in situ. The two above-ground vaults are used alternately. While one vault is filling up, the other (full) one stores the fecal material under dry conditions for at least six months.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; During this resting period, no fresh feces are allowed to enter the full vault. In order to switch from one vault to the other, the user interface can either be switched or both vaults can be equipped with fixed seats and a cover sufficient to prevent access to the full vault. When the second vault becomes full and at least 6 months have passed, the first vault is emptied with a shovel and then the user interface is moved over accordingly. The vaults are commonly sized so that one vault fills up in six to 12 months.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

=== Other (portable, mobile) ===
[[File:Nature's HeadFullforWikipedia.jpg|thumb|Example of a portable (mobile) UDDT constructed out of molded plastic at a household in [[Vermont]], U.S.]]
{{Further|Portable toilet}}
Other types of UDDTs exist which are essentially variations of the single-vault type, but which are more self-contained, sometimes referred to as portable, mobile or stand-alone units and identifiable by their one-piece molded plastic shells or, in the case of [[Do it yourself|DIY]] versions, simple plywood box construction. Most users of self-contained UDDTs rely upon a post-treatment process to ensure pathogen reduction. This post-treatment may consist of long-term storage or addition to an existing or purpose-built compost pile or some combination thereof. A post-treatment step is unnecessary in the case of very modest seasonal use.

Mobile UDDTs are typically either fabricated of new materials in a factory or workshop using a mix of proprietary and off-the-shelf parts—and then sold to the public either directly or via distributors or retail outlets; or fabricated at home out of wood, using new and re-purposed parts and materials. They are typically compact and lightweight, allowing one person to easily lift, transport, and maneuver them into place. Likewise, installation is a relatively simple process given that everything needed for the proper functioning of the toilet, except a source of electrical power for those models that include a fan and some allowance for exterior ventilation, is contained within the molded or wooden carcass. One advantage of this type of UDDT is that they are portable, making them an interesting option for remote or temporary installations and for installations aboard moving vehicles or non-stationary residences such as boats, [[Recreational vehicle|recreational-vehicles]] (i.e. caravan, camper van, motor home) and [[Small house movement|tiny-houses]].

Features common to this type of UDDT include:
* a smooth, easy-to-clean exterior surface
* a molded seat with a cover (both or either sometimes fitted with a rubber or neoprene gasket to further assist in isolating the toilet's inner workings)
* a molded [[urine diversion]] bowl (or bucket and funnel assembly) to facilitate the separate collection and storage in separate containers of urine and feces (the containers consisting of either a proprietary design or, in the case of [[Do it yourself|DIY]] versions, readily-available or re-purposed buckets, bottles or jugs)
* some allowance for either passive or active mechanical ventilation either consisting of a screened or filtered air inlet and a screened or filtered exhaust outlet (the latter consisting of a standard fitting to allow hook-up to a length of piping or tubing that is connected to the outdoors).
Features unique to some designs include:
* cleats for fastening the toilet to the floor (particularly useful when the toilet is installed in a moving vehicle or non-stationary residence)
* spill-proof urine storage to aid in leak-prevention during stormy weather or when otherwise underway (as in a moving boat or RV)
* built-in agitator for mixing and aerating the contents of the feces container (which greatly aids in drying and odor prevention)
* automatically or manually deployed pivoting or hinged trap door for covering the feces container when not in use.

== Health aspects ==
During normal use, a UDDT is just as hygienic and safe to use as any other type of toilet. However, health aspects need to be considered during removal and emptying of the urine and feces containers of a UDDT. These health risks during emptying of the feces vault or container are significantly lower when compared to emptying the pit of [[pit latrine]]s or the buckets of some types of [[dry toilet]]s without urine diversion. However, the health risks are somewhat higher when compared to a [[flush toilet]] where the user does not have to carry out any emptying or maintenance tasks at the household level unless the flush toilet plugs, back-flows or otherwise experiences operating problems.

Compared to a flush toilet being flushed without closing its lid, a UDDT would have a lower risk of ''Clostridium difficile'' spreading via [[aerosolization]], as it does not involve turbulent water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Best|first1=EL|last2=Sandoe|first2=JA|last3=Wilcox|first3=MH|title=Potential for aerosolization of Clostridium difficile after flushing toilets: the role of toilet lids in reducing environmental contamination risk.|journal=Journal of Hospital Infection|pmid=22137761|doi=10.1016/j.jhin.2011.08.010|volume=80|date=January 2012|pages=1–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ag.arizona.edu/media/archives/6.11.html|title=Dr. Germ|last=Arizona|first=University of|date=February 17, 2005|website=Information for News Media|publisher=University of Arizona|access-date=September 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding the health risks associated with reuse activities, the [[World Health Organisation Composite International Diagnostic Interview|World Health Organisation's]] guidelines' from 2006 titled "Guidelines for the safe use of wastewater, excreta and greywater in agriculture" explain the management of health risks associated with the use of excreta in agriculture.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{cite book|last1=|title=WHO guidelines for the safe use of wastewater, excreta and greywater. Volume 4. Excreta and greywater use in agriculture|publisher=WHO, Geneva|isbn=92 4 154685 9|url=http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/1004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The key concept in these guidelines is the multiple barrier approach which can also be applied to reuse activities in connection with UDDTs.[[File:Compost from UDD toilets (3562078601).jpg|thumb|Dried fecal matter from UDDTs after external composting, now ready for reuse (Addis Ababa, Ethiopia)]]

== Usage ==

=== Wiping materials ===
For wiping of the anal area after [[defecation]]—or for wiping after [[urination]]—UDDT users can avail themselves of the same materials that are utilized while using other types of toilets. Suitable biodegradable materials available in the surroundings can also be used, such as toilet paper, leaves, corn cobs or sticks. These materials are deposited along with feces in the feces portion of the toilet so that everything can eventually decompose together. For example, in Ecuador the soft, perfumed leaves of ''[[Piper auritum]]'', ''[[Piperaceae]]'' and ''[[Melastomataceae]]'' are being used.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Users have also used stones, although this makes the vault fill up very fast and is therefore not practical for UDDTs.

For portable UDDTs in particular, used [[toilet paper]] can alternatively be placed in a separate waste bin (for subsequent incineration, composting or disposal), as the addition of soiled toilet paper into the relatively small feces container could otherwise lead to it being filled rather quickly with mainly just toilet paper.

=== Anal cleansing with water ===
{{Further|Anal cleansing}}
UDDTs can accommodate users who prefer [[anal cleansing]] with water rather than with toilet paper by utilising either a three-hole urine diversion squatting pan or an area and drain next to the urine diversion pedestal where washing can take place—away from the urine and feces holes. This is essential so as not to contaminate the urine and to keep the feces as dry as possible.

Due to the fecal content of anal cleansing water, it should be considered as [[Blackwater (waste)|blackwater]] and treated or disposed of accordingly. Anal cleansing water can be drained into a soak pit, planted mulch bed or an infiltration trench. The anal cleansing water should be discharged into coarse material below the ground, but well above the water table to avoid [[groundwater pollution]].

Some UDDT designs are arranged such that the users do their anal cleansing with water above the urine compartment. This may be done for simplicity reasons, i.e. in order to avoid the need for a third hole and drain pipe for the anal cleansing water. This mixture of urine and anal cleansing water requires further treatment to remove pathogens before it can be safely utilized in agriculture.

Water for anal cleansing can be supplied via a hose or spigot fed by a pressurized water delivery system or a gravity fed system supplied by a rainwater tank located overhead or from a water bottle or jug that the user carries into the toilet cubicle.

=== Cover materials ===
For most UDDT types, users are encouraged to add a handful or scoopful of dry cover material directly after each [[defecation]] event. This cover material is added for the following purposes: to promote dry conditions in the feces vault by absorbing moisture, to control odor, to prevent infestation of flies and to create a visual barrier for the next user. It is also important to ensure that enough air can flow through the pile of drying feces. For this reason bulky or fibrous material that is dry and that decomposes slowly is recommended. A range of cover materials and combinations of these materials can be used, depending on what is readily available:
* Leaves are good, but intact they are too coarse to cover the feces properly to keep flies from getting in and odor from getting out.
* Sawdust works and can smell nice, depending on the tree species (the wood should be untreated e.g. sawdust from tree felling or pruning)
* Rice hulls are suitable in areas where rice is grown.
* Soil is excellent, abundant and nearly universally available.
* Wood ash as a cover material is appropriate but might not be available in sufficient volumes.
* Dried [[moss]]es ([[sphagnum]], [[peat]] etc.)
* Lime can be used but is often more expensive than other options. 
Lime and wood ash both have the advantage of raising the pH value of the feces pile, thus adding to the pathogen killing abilities.

It can be beneficial to select the cover material carefully in order to not only cover the feces but also to inoculate them with beneficial soil microbes. In that case, finished compost could be used as cover material, although it is important that the users either do not touch this cover material with their bare hands or that the composting process is sufficiently controlled such that no pathogens remain in the material.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

==== No cover materials added ====
In some circumstances and for reasons of simplicity, it can be sufficient to not use cover materials at all or to use toilet paper itself as cover material. One example is the case where the UDDT has a mechanized ventilation system and a view guard, like the UDDT manufactured by Separett which has a removable bucket, built-in fan and blue plastic view guard which closes when weight is removed from the toilet seat after use.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Also in the case of public toilets, it can be easier to let the caretaker perform the task of adding cover material, rather than the user. An example of this are the public single vault UDDTs operated by the not-for-profit company Sanergy in low-income urban areas in Kenya.

== Resulting products ==

=== Dried feces ===

==== Further treatment ====
The required degree of treatment for the collected dried feces depends entirely on whether this product will be reused in agriculture. If it is not reused, but only buried, then no further treatment is required. The dried feces are in almost all cases not entirely sanitized when removed from a vault of the UDDT, so careful handling is obligatory. In scenarios wherein excreta is to be reused in agriculture, a secondary treatment of fecal matter and storage of urine is advisable to ensure adequate sanitization. Fecal material from single vault UDDTs must always be post-treated, even if just via prolonged storage. Fecal material from double vaults has typically passed a certain storage time and is therefore already more sanitized. However, a secondary form of treatment is optional but recommended for household systems and required for large-scale systems.

Secondary treatment can be performed at the community or household level and can include [[thermophilic composting]] where fecal material is composted at over 50&amp;nbsp;°C, prolonged storage with the duration of 1.5 to two years, chemical treatment with ammonia from urine to inactivate the pathogens, [[solar sanitation]] for further drying or heat treatment to eliminate pathogens.&lt;ref&gt;Niwagaba, C. B. (2009). [http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/703 Treatment technologies for human faeces and urine.] PhD thesis, Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, Uppsala, Sweden.&lt;/ref&gt; The most difficult pathogens to eliminate from the drying feces in the feces vaults are the helminth eggs which can cause helminth infections.

==== Reuse in agriculture or burial ====
{{Main|Reuse of excreta}}
Reuse of treated feces in agriculture—like [[reuse of excreta]] in agriculture in general—can result in increased crop production through fertilizing effects of nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium and improved soil fertility through organic carbon. If the dried feces are not reused in agriculture they can instead be buried at a minimum depth of 25&amp;nbsp;cm in which case they normally do not pose a public health risk.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

=== Urine ===

==== Further treatment ====
The required degree of treatment for the collected urine depends entirely on whether this product will be reused in agriculture. If it is not reused, but only infiltrated, then no further treatment is required.

Urine that leaves the body of a healthy person is close to being sterile and requires much less treatment for pathogen removal than feces or [[fecal sludge]]. However, a contamination of urine with fecal pathogens is possible if the UDDT is not used correctly, i.e. when some fecal matter finds its way into the urine compartment.&lt;ref name=":Winker"&gt;von Münch, E., Winker, M.

The exact survival time of this particular virus in human urine outside of the human body is unclear but probably "up to several days" like with other body fluids at room temperature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.cdc.gov/vhf/ebola/transmission/qas.html|title = Ebola (Ebola Virus Disease)Transmission, Q&amp;As on Transmission|date = 20 November 2014|accessdate = 5 January 2015|website = |publisher = CDC (Centres for Disease Control and Prevention)|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For these reasons, urine should always be treated for pathogen removal if it is going to be reused, unless reuse occurs at the same household where the urine was collected and on crops that are only consumed by these household members (in which case an infection amongst family members is more likely to occur via handshakes and hugs than via urine reuse activities).&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;Richert, A., Gensch, R., Jönsson, H., Stenström, T., Dagerskog, L. (2010). [http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/757 Practical guidance on the use of urine in crop production]. Stockholm Environment Institute (SEI), Sweden&lt;/ref&gt;

The simplest and most common method of urine treatment for pathogen removal is via storage in closed vessels. The decomposition of [[urea]] that is present in urine into ammonia and hydrocarbonate leads to an increase in ammonia concentration and an increase of pH value to above 9. These two processes lead to pathogen reduction, and work more efficiently in warm temperatures and with low dilution of the urine with water.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Storage of urine kills bacterial pathogens encountered in urine&amp;nbsp;– including Salmonella typhi and paratyphi and [[Mycobacterium tuberculosis]]'' ''– in a relatively short time span: a storage time of five weeks at temperatures below 20&amp;nbsp;°C or of two weeks at temperatures above 20&amp;nbsp;°C has been recommended to prevent transmission of mycobacteria when recycling human urine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vinnerås|first1=Björn|last2=Bölske|first2=Göran|last3=Wahlström|first3=Helene|last4=Albihn|first4=Ann|title=Survival of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Mycobacterium bovis in human urine|journal=Water Science &amp; Technology|date=March 2011|volume=63|issue=6|pages=1075–80|doi=10.2166/wst.2011.344|pmid=21436541}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recommended storage times to kill pathogens in urine vary from one to six months depending on ambient temperatures, the scale of the urine collection system and which crops will be fertilised with the urine.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

==== Reuse in agriculture or infiltration ====
{{Main|Reuse of excreta}}
Reuse of treated urine in agriculture—like [[reuse of excreta]] in agriculture in general—can result in increased crop production through fertilizing effects of nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium and improved soil fertility through organic carbon. Urine from the UDDTs can safely be used as nitrogen-rich and phosphorus and potassium containing [[fertiliser|fertilizer]] after a recommended storage period for [[pathogen]] reduction (see above under "Further Treatment").

In cases where no reuse is possible or desired, urine is usually infiltrated in the soil unless this practice would cause [[groundwater]] pollution. In eThekwini municipality in South Africa&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; or in Lima, Peru, for example, urine from UDDTs is safely infiltrated into the soil because the groundwater level is very low there and the groundwater is not used for any particular purpose. Infiltration can be done by directing the urine to a soak pit or by running a perforated urine pipe from the toilet to an area outside, where the hose is sloping gently downhill (for rural areas). Clogging of the pipe's holes can be avoided by ensuring there are no T-junctions, no joints and that a plastic mesh is installed in the urine funnel of the toilet to keep everything other than urine out.[[File:UDDT in Addis Ababa (3562893032).jpg|thumb|Very simple home-made design for a UDDT with a funnel for urine collection and a bucket for feces collection at a household in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia]]

== Comparison ==

=== Pit latrines ===
Reasons for keeping urine and feces separate in a UDDT compared to a [[pit latrine]] can be to:&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;
#  reduce odor (mixing urine and feces together causes substantial odor);
#  avoid production of wet, odorous fecal sludge, which has to be removed by someone when the pit latrine is full;
#  enable fast drying of feces which makes handling of feces far more simple and hygienic;
#  reduce environmental impacts;

The advantage of UDDTs compared to [[pit latrine]]s is the conversion of feces into a dry odorless material and therefore an avoidance of the issues surrounding liquid [[faecal sludge|fecal sludge]] management (e.g. odor, fly attraction, difficulties in pit emptying). A well-maintained UDDT is an odor and insect free toilet which is appreciated by users and allows simple removal and far less offensive and safer handling of the fecal material once the feces vault has filled up. Moreover, the risk of water pollution is minimised through the safe containment of feces in above-ground vaults and this allows the toilets to be constructed in locations where pit-based systems are not appropriate.

UDDTs with vaults are also more permanent structures than most pit latrines, the latter of which in rural areas are typically relocated when the pit is full rather than emptying the pit. Therefore, pit latrines need more space and people are less willing to invest in a higher quality super-structure as it will have to be dismantled and moved at some point.

In the experience of the non-governmental organisation [[Women in Europe for a Common Future|WECF]] who introduced UDDTs in [[EECCA]] countries to people who had pit latrines, it was most successful converting people who were in regions lacking a reliable water supply and wastewater management. Since the introduction required behavior change in the recipients, WECF considered awareness raising and training by local partners to be important.&lt;ref name=wendland&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wendland|first1=Claudia|last2=Deegener|first2=Stefan|last3=Jorritsma|first3=Fedde|title=Experiences with urine diverting dry toilets (UDDTs) for households, schools and kindergarten in Eastern Europe, the Caucasus and Central Asia (EECCA)|journal=Sustainable Sanitation Practice|volume=2011|issue=6|page=16|url=http://www.wecf.eu/download/2011/February/SSP-06_Jan2011_16-221.pdf|accessdate=18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sewer- and septic tank-based sanitation ===
The comparison of UDDTs with sewer-based sanitation systems ([[sewerage]] and [[wastewater treatment plants]]) is not as straightforward as the comparison with pit latrines as a sewer does not only deal with excreta management like a UDDT does, but it also transports greywater, municipal [[wastewater]], stormwater and industrial wastewater. However, the installation of UDDTs in all households connected to a common sewer would result in vastly reduced volumes of water, nutrients and organic matter that arrive at the associated wastewater treatment plant.

Sewer-based excreta management is impractical in many regions due to limited water supplies and the high cost of sewer systems and wastewater treatment plants. Furthermore, water-based sanitation systems (flush toilets) dilute excreta and create vast wastewater streams, something that UDDTs do not.

Similarly, the comparison between UDDTs and [[septic tank]]-based sanitation systems is not as straightforward as the comparison with pit latrines as a septic system also treats greywater. However, the relatively high costs of septic systems, particularly mound-type septic systems can be partially mitigated or, if used in conjunction with an onsite greywater system, eliminated altogether by installing UDDTs in place of flush toilets.

Portable UDDTs offer the potential advantages of greater local control and quick deployment which is particularly useful when there is no capable centralized institutional infrastructure in place or no financial ability to implement larger centralized systems.

==== Pharmaceutical residues and other micro-pollutants ====
The separate, waterless collection and treatment of urine and feces in UDDTs prevents [[hormones]], [[pharmaceutical drug|pharmaceutical]] residues and other micro-pollutants which are contained in human excreta from entering surface water or groundwater via treated sewage.&lt;ref name=":Winker" /&gt; This is because in conventional sewage treatment plants, these micro-pollutants are only partially removed and the remainder is discharged into surface water, possibly reaching the groundwater. Detected concentrations of pharmaceutical residues in groundwater were in the order of 50&amp;nbsp;ng/L in several locations in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Winker, M. (2009). [http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/1007 Pharmaceutical residues in urine and potential risks related to usage as fertiliser in agriculture].

If the excreta collected from UDDTs is treated further and buried or used as agricultural or horticultural fertilizer then the pharmaceutical residues in the excreta will be degraded better in terrestrial systems (soil) than in aquatic systems.&lt;ref name=":Winker" /&gt; Therefore, UDDTs (or in fact all [[urine diversion]] systems) have an advantage over sewer-based sanitation systems with respect to these issue with micro-pollutants.

== Challenges ==
[[File:Urine Diversion Dehydration Toilet at Mwijo Primary School (4460239832).jpg|thumb|School UDDT in rural areas of Western Kenya; the steep stairs are not recommended as they are a barrier for people with disabilities]]

=== Operational issues ===
Operational problems with UDDTs that sometimes occur include:&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;
* Urine may accumulate in the urine diversion section of the toilet due to blockages in the urine pipe. Attention should be paid to urine pipe selection and layout and also the possible inclusion of plastic mesh at the mouth of the urine drain hole.
* Foul odors may be emitted from the feces vault because the contents of the feces vault have become too wet. User education on addition of cover materials and correct use in general is important to overcome this problem, or may be necessary to improve the ventilation system.
* Foul odors may come from the urine drainage or collection system if urine is allowed to pool or otherwise stagnate. For UDDTs with urine piping, mitigation can be achieved by following best design and installation practices. For UDDTs utilizing a urine collection system, to regularly empty and clean the container used for collection is important.
* Flies, other insects or rodents may appear in the feces vault, usually because it has become too wet. User education on correct use of the UDDT, trapping rodents and checking the ventilation system are actions to be taken.
* In the case of double vault UDDTs, users may mistakenly defecate into the inactive or resting vault. Users should be educated about not using the inactive vault and be encouraged to place a lid or otherwise seal the inactive vault to prevent this from happening.
Each of these problems are quite simple to solve technically in conjunction with user education and follow-up visits. However, there needs to be a commitment and willingness by the users or caretakers to resolve such problems. Due to insufficient commitment, user preparation, follow-up and support, such operational problems have on occasion led to abandonment, as in the case of several UDDT pilot projects.

=== Awareness and coordination ===
More awareness is required by the UDDT user to use it properly (for instance, not urinating into feces compartment and reacting appropriately when the urine vessel is full, when there are problems with the urine soak pit, when the urine pipe is blocked or when the feces vaults or container(s) are full).

One challenge of a sanitation system with UDDTs—and perhaps even with [[resource recovery|reuse of excreta]] in agriculture—compared to a conventional sewer-based system is that it requires greater coordination and cooperation amongst stakeholders from different sectors.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Costs ==
UDDTs are sometimes considered too expensive compared to pit latrines, but this criticism does not include the cost of emptying pits and the potential value of fertilizers that can be recycled via UDDTs should the users wish to do so (noting that most UDDT installations worldwide currently do not reuse excreta in agriculture). Rather than looking only at construction costs, long-term operational costs and benefits should also be considered, especially since the regular emptying or re-building of pit latrines may be a significant expense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=McIntyre, P., Casella D., Fonseca, C. and Burr, P|title=Priceless! Uncovering the real costs of water and sanitation|publisher=The Hague: IRC|isbn=978-90-6687-082-6|url=http://www.ircwash.org/sites/default/files/2014_priceless_mcintyreetal_0.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; When a period of for example 10 years is considered, UDDTs may well be the more economical alternative, since the emptying of feces vaults is simple and safer, thus less expensive, even if users decide to enter into a contract with someone else to do this.

Compared to flush toilets connected to sewer systems and wastewater treatment plants, UDDTs are usually less expensive. However, to enable accurate comparisons of costs, this needs to be assessed on a case-by-case basis because the sewer system and treatment plant also transports and treats greywater whereas the UDDT does not. This means that the two systems provide a different level of service to the user. An example calculation for such a cost comparison exists for the case of Lima, Peru.&lt;ref&gt;Platzer, C., Hoffmann, H., Ticona, E. (2008). [http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/961 Alternatives to waterborne sanitation - a comparative study&amp;nbsp;– limits and potentials.] IRC Symposium: Sanitation for the urban poor—partnerships and governance, Delft, The Netherlands.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is even a minimalist UDDT model that costs essentially nothing to construct and which only requires salvaging and assembling selected plastic items from the garbage and which can be implemented by the poorest people, disaster victims, and those who want to gain experience with UDDTs.&lt;ref name="canaday"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://inodoroseco.blogspot.de/2013/10/a-free-minimalist-uddt-part-1.html|title = Indoroseco blog (in English and Spanish)|date = |accessdate = 27 November 2014|website = |publisher = Chris Canaday|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

The UDDTs with two dehydration vaults that are known today were originally designed around 1950 in Japan and further developed in Vietnam in the 1960s as a means of increasing the hygienic safety of excreta reused in agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;Winblad, U., Simpson-Hebert, M. (2004). [http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/487 Ecological Sanitation - Revised and enlarged edition.] Stockholm Environment Institute, Sweden&lt;/ref&gt; This means their development was originally closely linked to the [[ecosan]] (ecological sanitation) approach to optimizing [[resource recovery]] of nutrients and organic matter in agriculture. Beginning in the early part of the 2000s, UDDTs have been seen increasingly as a toilet type that can provide advantages even without any reuse activities attached to it.

Since the 1990s, modifications of this design (such as the addition of ventilation piping to the feces vault) have been developed in many countries. Prefabricated ceramic or plastic urine diversion squatting pans and pedestals have become available on the market, generally increasing the durability and perceived prestige associated with the system.

UDDTs have also been commercially produced in Sweden since the mid-1990s. For example, between 1994 and 2010 the Separett company sold approximately 200,000 UDDTs.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;von Münch, E., Winker, M. (2011). [http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/1148 Worldwide listing of suppliers for urine diversion pedestals/seats (for UDDTs or for UD flush toilets) - Appendix 3 of technology review of urine diversion components.] Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH, Eschborn, Germany&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous off-the shelf commercial products are now available and are used in locations where a connection to a [[sanitary sewer]] system is not possible, permitted or desired such as in remote summer cottages or for camping activities. At all times, users have also been building their own low-cost UDDTs with simple materials such as a funnel connected to a hose, a bucket and a seat.

== Examples ==

=== South Africa (eThekwini Municipality, Durban) ===
The highest number of UDDTs in one area have been installed by the eThekwini Municipality in the non-sewered peri-urban areas of Durban, South Africa. To date, about 80,000 UDDTs are in operation in that area, serving about 500,000 residents (reuse of urine or excreta is currently not taking place).&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Roma, E., Holzwarth, S., Buckley, C. (2011). [http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/791 Large-scale peri-urban and rural sanitation with UDDTs, eThekwini Municipality (Durban), South Africa - Case study of sustainable sanitation projects]. [[Sustainable Sanitation Alliance]] (SuSanA)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Haiti ===
The NGO [[Sustainable Organic Integrated Livelihoods|SOIL]] in Haiti began building UDDTs and composting plants in [[Port-au-Prince]] as part of the [[2010 Haiti earthquake]] emergency relief effort in northern Haiti.&lt;ref&gt;Christine Dell'Amore, [http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2011/10/111026-haiti-waste-poop-fertilizer-farms-soil-science-environment/ "Human Waste to Revive Haitian Farmland?"], ''The National Geographic'', October 26, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; They have since branched out into providing toilets for residential use, this being their primary goal moving forward as they transition their focus from emergency relief to providing sustainable and [[ecological sanitation]] for paying customers. Their current dry toilet design for households includes a small portable single vault unit made out of wood that is either fitted with a single container for combined excreta collection or with a urine diversion insert, with 80% of these installations currently being of the UDDT type. As of 2014, SOIL has transformed all of their public UDDT vault toilets to an open vault design with removable plastic drums for feces collection. This improves the processes by which feces is collected and transported to their waste treatment facility, making their business now a fully "[[Container-based sanitation|container-based system]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.oursoil.org/what-we-do/dignified-sanitation/|title = SOIL website—dignified sanitation|date = |accessdate = 25 November 2014|website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; This allows SOIL to respond to heavy use (since their toilets were filling up too quickly) and ensures a safe final product for reuse. In most cases, these UDDTs utilize soak pits (normally located directly beneath the toilet superstructure) for onsite disposal of urine.
[[File:SOIL Poopmobile delivering buckets of waste to the SOIL composting facility in Port-au-Prince.jpg|thumb|A [[Sustainable Organic Integrated Livelihoods|SOIL]] truck delivering buckets of human excreta from mobile household UDDTs to the SOIL composting facility in Port-au-Prince, Haiti]]

SOIL continues to provide [[humanitarian relief]] in some of Haiti’s most vulnerable communities&amp;nbsp;– notably those that have been particularly impacted by the [[cholera]] epidemic&amp;nbsp;–  by providing free access to public container-based UDDTs for over 3,500 people. In addition, over 2,000 people are currently accessing a SOIL "EcoSan toilet" through the "EkoLakay" business pilot, with a growing waitlist of people wanting to join, thus demonstrating the market demand for affordable sanitation, even in the world’s most economically impoverished communities.

Since building the first waste treatment facility in Haiti in 2009, SOIL has become one of the largest waste treatment operations in the country. SOIL’s two composting waste treatment facilities currently transform over 20,000 gallons (75,708 liters) of human waste into safe, organic, agricultural-grade compost every month. The compost produced at these facilities is sold to farmers, organizations, businesses, and institutions around the country to help finance SOIL’s waste treatment operations.

=== Ecuador ===
Hundreds of UDDTs have been built in Ecuador to date. The various models in use adapt to different preferences, budgets and conditions, and the need to sometimes transport materials to remote locations by small airplanes.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://inodoroseco.blogspot.com|title = Inodoroseco blog (in English and Spanish)|date = |accessdate = 27 November 2014|website = |publisher = Chris Canaday|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of these UDDTs serve [[indigenous peoples|indigenous communities]] who live along small rivers as well as [[ecotourism]] operations in the Amazonian part of the country. In these regions, piped [[water supply]] is often lacking, clay-rich soils do not permit infiltration of wastewater, and the [[groundwater]] level is usually high. These factors make other types of toilets or other forms of excreta management problematic. For example, local governments and ecotourism operations often install flush toilets that drain straight into rivers or into holes in the ground, where the water is intended to drain but cannot, since the soil is mostly impermeable clay. Coupled with the abundant local rainfall, these pits tend to fill very fast and overflow into the nearest streams. The streams get easily contaminated with fecal matter, as they are often quite small and there is not much dilution with clean river water. This leads to health hazards for the communities who use these rivers for drinking water, washing, swimming, and fishing.

=== Namibia ===
In Namibia a type of UDDT was developed which is locally called the "Otji toilet". This UDDT also uses the [[Coandă effect]] to divert the majority of the urine into a trough at the base of the pedestal and from there into an infiltration area.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;Ingle, R., Berdau, S., Kleemann, F., Arndt, P. (2012). [http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/1608 What does it take to convince decision makers in Omaruru, Namibia to scale up urine diversion dehydration "Otji toilets"?] 4th International Dry Toilet Conference, Tampere, Finland&lt;/ref&gt; Between 2003 and 2011 about 1,200 Otji toilets have been installed in the south of Namibia and the rural areas around the Otjiwarongo District. Using the same design, the NGO EcoSur has built "Otji style" UDDTs in Ecuador and El Salvador since 2007, where they are called "Inodoro Seco".&lt;ref&gt;Kleemann, F., Berdau, S. (2011). [http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/1186 Otji toilets for peri-urban informal households in Omaruru, Namibia] - Case study of sustainable sanitation projects. [[Sustainable Sanitation Alliance]] (SuSanA).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other countries ===
* The NGO [[Women in Europe for a Common Future]] (WECF) and local partners have built urine-diverting dry toilets for schools in Eastern Europe, Caucasus and Central Asia (EECCA region) in areas that lack a reliable water supply and waste management.&lt;ref name="wendland" /&gt; 
* In [[El Alto]], Bolivia the NGO Fundación Sumaj Huasi has constructed nearly 1000 UDDTs for 4500 persons, and is carrying out communal [[composting]] for the excreta collected.&lt;ref&gt;Suntura, C., Sandoval, B. (2012).

SuSanA, Fundación Sumaj Huasi, Stockholm Environment Institute&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Boating, recreational vehicles and camping ===
* For the [[boating]] community, it can also be an interesting alternative to convert from conventional nautical toilets that store waste in blackwater tanks, or immediate discharge overboard, to a UDDT. Three such UDDTs designed for nautical and recreational vehicle ([[RV]]) use (but not limited to these uses) are marketed in the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the U.K. and some parts of the European Union under the brand names "C-Head" toilet, "BoonJon" toilet, "Nature's Head Toilet" and "Air Head Toilet".
* [[Camping]]: [[Leave no trace]] is not only a [[philosophy]] but a necessity in areas where human waste left behind will not decay naturally. There are now models of UDDTs available (for example by the Swedish company Separett) that allow feces to be collected and packed out. Only urine is left behind, which is of less concern as urine is nearly pathogen free.

== Society and culture ==

[[File:Ready user (5846643357).jpg|thumb|upright|Demonstrating the use of a low-cost UDDT in Pumpuentsa, Ecuador.]]

=== General hurdles for acceptance ===
Significant barriers to more universal acceptance of this technology differ in their extent for different parts of the world but generally include: lack of awareness, a limited supply of prefabricated UDDT components and a lack of interest in financing any sanitation services for the non-sewered portions of urban settlements.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Existing, affordable piped [[water supply]] and [[sanitary sewer]] infrastructure may also be an impediment to widespread adoption of UDDTs as their existence not only removes two of the main drivers for UDDTs but also represents a significant public investment. This can restrict efforts to switch to new toilet types and [[sanitation]] systems.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

Many users do not have an interest in handling their excreta which can be another hurdle for acceptance of UDDTs. Therefore, provisions should be made to offer door-to-door/curbside collection of these materials, similar to how existing municipal or private schemes collect household organic waste (from kitchens and gardens, etc.) and transport these materials to a centralized facility for composting or biogas generation.

It is important that the sanitation system which is selected fits into an existing legal framework and that it has support at the local policy level and amongst the various government departments affected.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Flores|first1=A.|title=Towards sustainable sanitation: evaluating the sustainability of resource-oriented sanitation—PhD Thesis, University of Cambridge, UK|url=http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/1172|website=|publisher=|accessdate=19 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Policies could encourage the widespread use of UDDTs through financial support of research programmes, enactment of regulations that require the recovery of resources from wastewater and adequately account for the reduced contaminant loading and incentives for resource recovery.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Number of users ===
The exact number of people using UDDTs worldwide is unknown, but a rough estimate by [[Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit|GIZ]] (German Development Cooperation) in 2012 based on known projects in 84 countries put the number at approximately 2 million people.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;GIZ (2012).

===== Use of dried feces =====
The International Association of Plumbing and Mechanical Officials (IAPMO), a plumbing and mechanical code structure currently utilized by many western states, has recently proposed an addition to its "Green Plumbing Mechanical Code Supplement" that, "...outlines performance criteria for site built composting toilets with and without urine diversion and manufactured composting toilets."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://us2.campaign-archive2.com/?u=b461cb1ec907251340324d592&amp;id=ce81adae05&amp;e=7e841e70f4|title = Recode September 2014 Newsletter|date = September 2014|accessdate = 15 January 2015|website = Recode|publisher = Recode|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; If adopted, this new far reaching composting and urine diversion toilet code&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.iapmo.org/Documents/green/Item%2093%20%20Composting%20Toilet%20and%20Urine%20Diversion%20Systems%20Proposal.pdf|title = IAPMO Proposed Composting and Urine DIversion Toilet Code|date = |accessdate = 15 January 2015|website = The IAPMO Group|publisher = International Association of Plumbing and Mechanical Officials|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; (the first of its kind in the United States) will appear in the 2015 edition of the Green Supplement to the Uniform Plumbing Code.&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.plumbingengineer.com/content/iapmo-gpmcs-raising-bar-water-energy-efficiency|title = IAPMO GPMCS raising the bar for water, energy efficiency|date = January 2015|accessdate = 15 January 2015|website = Plumbing Engineer|publisher = Plumbing Engineer|last = Cole|first = Daniel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several U.S. states currently permit disposal of feces from UDDTs or [[composting toilets]] (usually a clear distinction between different types of dry toilets is not made) by burial with some mandating lesser minimum depths, as little as 6 inches, and others not specifying any minimum depth at all.

* The Commonwealth of Massachusetts requires that "residuals from the [composting toilet] system must be buried on-site and covered with a minimum of six inches of clean compacted soil".&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Commonwealth of Massachusetts|title=Regulatory Provisions for Composting Toilets and Greywater Systems|url=http://www.mass.gov/eea/agencies/massdep/water/wastewater/regulatory-provisions-for-compost-toilets-and-greywater.html|website=The Official Website of the Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs|accessdate=3 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In Oregon the applicable regulations state that "humus from composting toilets may be used around ornamental shrubs, flowers, trees, or fruit trees and shall be buried under at least twelve inches of soil cover."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Department of Consumer and Business Services, Building Codes Division|first1=Division 770|title=Plumbing product approvals 918-770-0050|url=https://secure.sos.state.or.us/oard/displayDivisionRules.action?selectedDivision=4192|website=Oregon Secretary of State|publisher=Oregon Administrative Rules|accessdate=3 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For [[dry toilet]] users in the United States (which includes users of UDDTs), an important distinction to keep in mind—and one that is supported by the aforementioned existence of numerous state regulations which make no mention of, and also diverge widely from, the requirements of the federal regulations that govern the management of [[sewage sludge]]—is that as long as the excreta in question is not ever referred to as "fertilizer" (but instead simply a material that is being disposed of) the federal 503 rule, known colloquially as the "EPA Biosolids Rule" or the "EPA Sludge Rule", has no jurisdiction over the byproducts of a dry toilet and that all oversight of these materials falls to the individual states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=EPA 832-F-99-066|first1=September 1999|title=Water Efficiency Technology Fact Sheet Composting Toilets|url=http://water.epa.gov/aboutow/owm/upload/2005_07_14_comp.pdf|website=United States Environmental Protection Agency|publisher=Office of Water|accessdate=3 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Title 40 - Protection of Environment Chapter I: Environmental Protection Agency, Subchapter 0 - Sewage sludge Part 503 - Standards for the use or disposal of sewage sludge|url=http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?tpl=/ecfrbrowse/Title40/40cfr503_main_02.tpl|publisher=U.S. Government Publishing Office|accessdate=3 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Use of urine =====
At present reuse of urine as a fertilizer in the United States is still in the conceptual phase. Studies into its feasibility are currently underway in Brattleboro, Vermont, and are being conducted by the not-for-profit Rich Earth Institute. Perhaps accordingly, a quick review of the pertinent regulations in existence in several different states turns up zero mentions of "urine diversion" and zero mentions of urine specifically as a standalone material which requires distinct oversight. Instead, when it is mentioned, it is always in conjunction with feces (as in the contents of a [[composting toilet]] or other non-source separating [[dry toilet]] type. At least one state specifically regulates "liquids" produced but not recycled by a composting toilet (which could be construed as referring to urine) but the fact remains that none of the states surveyed distinctly uses the word "urine" when referring to "liquids".&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; It is expected that as urine diverting toilets grow in popularity states will respond by amending their existing regulations to account for urine diverting toilets and also urine as a separate and distinct waste or resource stream.

Moreover, plans are currently underway to finalize a uniform plumbing code that would, "represent the first codified requirements for the safe installation, maintenance and use for [composting and urine diversion toilets] in any installation."&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;

The '''vaginal flora in pregnancy''', or '''vaginal microbiota in pregnancy''', is different from the [[vaginal flora]] (the population of microorganisms that resides in the vagina) before [[sexual maturity]], during reproductive years, and after [[menopause]]. A description of the vaginal flora of pregnant women who are [[immunocompromised]] is not covered in this article. The composition of the vaginal flora significantly differs in [[pregnancy]].&lt;ref name="AfricaNel2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Africa|first1=Charlene|last2=Nel|first2=Janske|last3=Stemmet|first3=Megan|title=Anaerobes and Bacterial Vaginosis in Pregnancy: Virulence Factors Contributing to Vaginal Colonisation|journal=International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health|volume=11|issue=7|year=2014|pages=6979–7000|issn=1660-4601|doi=10.3390/ijerph110706979|pmid=25014248|pmc=4113856}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bacteria or viruses that are infectious most often have no symptoms.

==Normal microbiota==
{{main article|List of microbiota species of the lower reproductive tract of women}}
{{Further information|Vaginal flora}}

==Microbiota in pregnancy==
In normal pregnancy, the resident vaginal flora is thought to provide protection against infection. The microbiota during pregnancy is predominantly Lactobacillus spp.  Microbiota composition can change during the course of the pregnancy.  If the microbiota populations become more diverse, indicating that the normal Lactobacillus-dominated population has changed to a bacterial vaginosis population, risks of adverse pregnancy outcomes increase.&lt;ref name="LamontSobel2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lamont|first1=RF|last2=Sobel|first2=JD|last3=Akins|first3=RA|last4=Hassan|first4=SS|last5=Chaiworapongsa|first5=T|last6=Kusanovic|first6=JP|last7=Romero|first7=R|title=The vaginal microbiome: new information about genital tract flora using molecular based techniques|journal=BJOG: An International Journal of Obstetrics &amp; Gynaecology|volume=118|issue=5|year=2011|pages=533–549|issn=1470-0328|doi=10.1111/j.1471-0528.2010.02840.x|pmc=3055920}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vaginal discharge is common during pregnancy but is not an indicator of bacterial vaginosis or abnormal Lactobacillus-dominated microbiota.&lt;ref name="PetrovaLievens2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Petrova|first1=Mariya I.|last2=Lievens|first2=Elke|last3=Malik|first3=Shweta|last4=Imholz|first4=Nicole|last5=Lebeer|first5=Sarah|title=Lactobacillus species as biomarkers and agents that can promote various aspects of vaginal health|journal=Frontiers in Physiology|volume=6|year=2015|issn=1664-042X|doi=10.3389/fphys.2015.00081}}&lt;/ref&gt; The treatment of abnormal vaginal microbiota populations with lactobacilli and estriol during pregnancy was found to restore the microbiota to a normal state.&lt;ref name="UnluDonders2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Unlu|first1=Cihat|last2=Donders|first2=Gilbert|title=Use of lactobacilli and estriol combination in the treatment of disturbed vaginal ecosystem: a review|journal=Journal of the Turkish German Gynecological Association|volume=12|issue=4|year=2011|pages=239–246|issn=1309-0399|doi=10.5152/jtgga.2011.57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bacterial vaginosis and pregnancy==
{{further information|List of bacterial vaginosis microbiota}}
[[Bacterial vaginosis]] in pregnancy is an alteration of the normal vaginal microbiota of pregnancy. Intrauterine infections in pregnancy are caused by bacteria that cause inflammation.  The women may experience few or no symptoms. This sometimes leads to [[chorioamnionitis]] and other negative pregnancy outcomes. When there are high bacterial counts in of the vagina during pregnancy is typically due to the presence of the following organisms:

*''[[G. vaginalis]]''
*''[[F. nucleatum]]''
*''[[Staphylococci]]  spp''
*''[[Streptococci]]''
*''[[Atopobium vaginae]]''
*''[[Mobiluncus]] spp''
*''[[Mycoplasma]]'' spp
*[[Bacteroides ureolyticus]]
*''[[Fusobacterium]]''&lt;ref name="PetrovaLievens2015"/&gt;

==History==
Investigations into reproductive-associated microbiomes began around 1885 by [[Theodor Escherich]]. He wrote that [[meconium]] from the newborn was free of bacteria. This was interpreted as the uterine environment was sterile. Other investigations used sterile diapers for meconium collection. No bacteria were able to be cultured from the samples. Bacteria were detected and were directly proportional to the time between birth and the passage of meconium.&lt;ref name="Per2017"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Perez-Muñoz|first1=Maria Elisa|last2=Arrieta|first2=Marie-Claire|last3=Ramer-Tait|first3=Amanda E.|last4=Walter|first4=Jens|title=A critical assessment of the "sterile womb" and "in utero colonization" hypotheses: implications for research on the pioneer infant microbiome|journal=Microbiome|volume=5|issue=1|year=2017|issn=2049-2618|doi=10.1186/s40168-017-0268-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Weed Wars''''' is an American reality-documentary television series that documents a popular medical [[marijuana dispensary]], Harborside Health Center, in [[Oakland, California]]. The series premiered on the [[Discovery Channel]] on December 1, 2011.&lt;ref name="HuffPo"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/11/30/weed-wars-reality-show_n_1119583.html|title='Weed Wars,' Reality Show About Medical Marijuana In Oakland, Premieres December 1|date=November 30, 2011|last=Schwartz|first=Carly|publisher=''[[The Huffington Post]]''|accessdate=December 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series has since been cancelled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Discovery Cancels 'Weed Wars'|url=http://www.celebstoner.com/201203219541/news/celebstoner-news/discovery-cancels-weed-wars.html|accessdate=January 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In regards to their intentions by allowing their business to be documented for television, Steve DeAngelo has said, "We wanted to be a model to other dispensaries, most of [which] have a media phobia. We wanted to tell our story and we gave Discovery complete access so that people could make up their own minds... There are a lot of stereotypes about who comes to these dispensaries, but viewers will see our customers cover a huge cross-section of the population&amp;nbsp;– age, race and economic classes. They will also see how Harborside treats cannabis as a medicine, and we have a high standard of medical care."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2011/12/08/weed-wars-goes-inside-medical-marijuana-dispensary/|title='Weed Wars' Goes Inside Medical Marijuana Dispensary|date=December 8, 2011|last=McKay|first=Hollie|publisher=[[Fox News]]|accessdate=December 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Premise==
The series is mainly focused on the employees of the [[marijuana dispensary]] and the day-to-day aspects of running the business. It also chronicles the various customers to the store, as well as both large-scale growers and smaller, patient cannabis growers who are allowed to grow a limited number of plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.salon.com/2011/12/01/on_weed_wars_drug_cliches_go_up_in_smoke/singleton/|title=On "Weed Wars," drug clichés go up in smoke|date=December 1, 2011|last=Seitz|first=Matt|publisher=[[Salon.com]]|accessdate=December 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/television/discovery-marijuana-show-weed-wars-legalization-war-article-1.981818?localLinksEnabled=false|title=Discovery’s new marijuana show ‘Weed Wars’ looks at what happens after the legalization war|date=November 24, 2011|last=Hinckley|first=David|publisher=''[[New York Daily News]]''|accessdate=December 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Workplace (Health, Safety and Welfare) Regulations 1992''' is a [[United Kingdom]] [[Statutory Instrument (UK)|Statutory Instrument]] that stipulates general requirements on accommodation standards for nearly all workplaces. The '''regulations''' implemented [[European Union]] [[directive 89/654/EEC]] on minimum safety and health requirements for the workplace and [[repeal]] and supersede much of the [[Factories Act 1961]] and [[Offices, Shops and Railway Premises Act 1963]].&lt;ref name="explan"&gt;{{ cite web | author=Office of Public Sector Information | title=Workplace (Health, Safety and Welfare) Regulations 1992 - Explanatory Note | year=1992 | url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/SI/si1992/Uksi_19923004_en_5.htm#exnote | accessdate=2008-04-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 31 December 1995, all new and existing workplaces have had to comply to these regulations.&lt;ref name="HR Services The Occupational Health and Safety Unit"&gt;,{{cite web|url= http://www.uel.ac.uk/hs/workplaceHS1992.htm|title= HR Services The Occupational Health and Safety Unit}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Breach of the regulations by an [[employer]], controller of work premises or [[occupiers' liability|occupier]] of a [[factory]] is a [[crime]], punishable on [[summary conviction]] or on [[indictment]] with an unlimited fine. &lt;ref&gt;[[Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974]], [http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?LegType=All+Legislation&amp;title=health+and+safety+at+work+etc+act&amp;Year=1974&amp;searchEnacted=0&amp;extentMatchOnly=0&amp;confersPower=0&amp;blanketAmendment=0&amp;sortAlpha=0&amp;TYPE=QS&amp;PageNumber=1&amp;NavFrom=0&amp;parentActiveTextDocId=1316700&amp;ActiveTextDocId=1316745&amp;VersionNumber=2&amp;filesize=56647 ss.33(1)(c), 33(3)]&lt;/ref&gt; Either an individual or a [[body corporate|corporation]] can be punished&lt;ref&gt;[[Interpretation Act 1978]], s.5&lt;/ref&gt; and sentencing practice is published by the [[Sentencing Guidelines Council]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url=http://www.sentencing-guidelines.gov.uk/guidelines/other/courtappeal/default.asp?T=Cases&amp;catID=11&amp;subject=HEALTH%20AND%20SAFETY%20OFFENCES | title=(K) Miscellaneous offences - Health and Safety offences | work=Guideline Judgements Case Compendium | publisher=Sentencing Guidelines Council | accessdate=2008-03-08 | year=2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Enforcement is the responsibility of the [[Health and Safety Executive]] (HSE) or in some cases, [[Local government in England|local authorities]].&lt;ref&gt;Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974, s.18&lt;/ref&gt;

The HSE publishes a code of practice on implementing the regulations. Though a breach of the code creates neither civil nor criminal liability in itself, it could be [[evidence (law)|evidential]] as to either.&lt;ref&gt;HSE (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; The '''regulations''' do not create duties to members of the public.&lt;ref&gt;''Ricketts v. Torbay Council'' [2003] EWCA Civ 613&lt;/ref&gt;

==Premises to which regulations apply==
The '''regulations''' apply to all workplaces save for [[ship]]s, [[construction site]]s or [[Mining|mine]]s and [[quarries]].

The '''World Alliance for Breastfeeding Action''' ('''WABA''') is a network of people working on a global scale to eliminate obstacles to [[breastfeeding]] and to act on the [[Innocenti Declaration]]. The groups within this alliance tackle the problems from a variety of perspectives or point of views, such as [[Consumer protection|consumer advocates]], [[motherhood|mothers]], and [[lactation]] consultants.{{r|WHO|UNICEF}}

Among the various organizations and individuals involved in the creation of WABA, [[Derrick and Patrice Jelliffe|Derrick and Pat Jelliffe]], two experts in tropical [[paediatrics]] and infant [[nutrition]], were instrumental in its founding and in the launching of some of its more visible early initiatives.{{r|Ancestry|JTP|wabatribute|Obituary}} 

WABA organises the ''[[World Breastfeeding Week]]'', held annually August 1 through the 7th, to put together the efforts of all breastfeeding [[Advocacy|advocates]], [[government]]s, and the publicin more than 170 countries.{{r|LLLI}}

==Campaigns==
Several campaigns are associated with the WABA:

1991 to present - The [[Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative]] (BFHI) is a joint campaign by [[UNICEF]] and the [[World Health Organization]], and focuses mainly on [[hospital]] practices, implementing the principles of the [[Innocenti Declaration]].{{r|BFHI}}

1993 - This campaign tackled the problem of developing mother-friendly [[wiktionary:Workplace|workplace]]s. In general, they wanted mothers to be able to combine breastfeeding with their working atmosphere.

1994 - The main focus of the '94 campaign was to implement again the [[International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes]] in all countries to meet the demands of the Innocenti Declaration.

==International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes==
''[[International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes]]'' (Rules for [[industry|industries]], [[Health profession|health workers]], and governments to regulate the promotion of [[baby]] products through [[Product marketing|marketing]]):{{r|WHO PDF|WHO Book|ITCILO}}

# No [[advertising]] of any of these [[Product (business)|product]]s to the public.
# No [[Food sampling|free samples]] to mothers.
# No promotion of products in [[health care]] facilities, including the distribution of free or low-cost supplies.
# No company sales representatives to advise mothers.
# No gifts or personal samples to health workers.
# No words or pictures idealizing artificial feeding, or pictures of infants on [[label]]s of infant [[milk]] containers.
# Information to health workers should be [[science|scientific]] and factual.
# All information on artificial infant feeding, including that on labels, should explain the benefits of breastfeeding, and the costs and hazards associated with artificial feeding.
# Unsuitable products, such as sweetened [[condensed milk]], should not be promoted for babies.
# Manufacturers and distributors should comply with the Code's provisions even if countries have not adopted laws or other measures.

The WHPA was formed between ICN, FDI and WMA in 1999 as an alliance to address global health issues, with the secretariat being run from the ICN. FDI World Dental Federation was added to the Alliance in 2005&lt;ref name="Dental"/&gt; and the World Confederation for Physical Therapy joined in 2014. The aim of the organization is to facilitate collaboration between key health professionals and major international stakeholders such as governments, policy makers and the [[World Health Organization]]. The Alliance operates under the philosophy that by working in collaboration, instead of along parallel tracks, the [[patient]] and [[health care system]] benefit.

Since the creation of the alliance the WHPA has taken active and leading roles in fostering [[patient safety]], advocating a positive practice environment in the health care setting, human resource issues, regulation of the health professions, human rights in medicine, producing a core competency framework for international health consultants and discussing the future of healthcare. Other activities have involved combating [[counterfeit medicines]], condemning the [[Social stigma|stigma]] associated with [[mental illness]], [[multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis]] and [[tobacco]].

It regularly holds a Regulation Conference and Leadership Forum.

The WHPA Secretariat is hosted at the FDI World Dental Federation in Geneva, Switzerland.

'''Şahika Ercümen''' (born 16 January 1985) is a [[Turkey|Turkish]] [[dietitian]] and world record holder [[Free-diving|free-diver]].&lt;ref name="h1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="h2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="s1"/&gt;

Born on January 16, 1985 in [[Çanakkale]], she was educated at the Gazi Primary School, and received a secondary education at the Milli Piyango [[Anatolian High School]] in her hometown. For her higher education, she moved to [[Ankara]], and became a dietitian graduating from the Department of Nutrition and Dietetics at [[Başkent University]]'s Faculty of Health Sciences.&lt;ref name="h1"/&gt;

Her participation in [[underwater sports]] began with [[scuba diving]] and [[underwater rugby]]. For twelve years, she is interested in various branches of underwater sports, and is a member of four national teams since 2001. She participated with the [[underwater hockey]], [[underwater rugby]], [[underwater orienteering]] and free diving national teams in the World and European Championships.&lt;ref name="h1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="s1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="s2"/&gt;

==Achievements==
Her {{convert|110|m|ft|abbr=on}} long [[dynamic apnea]] under ice (DYN) that was achieved on February 11, 2011 in [[Weissensee (Carinthia)|Lake Weissensee]], [[Austria]], found entry into the ''[[Guinness World Records|Guinness Book of World Records]]'' for both for men and women.&lt;ref name="s1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="s2"/&gt; Former records were {{convert|70|m|ft|abbr=on}} for women and {{convert|108|m|ft|abbr=on}} for men.&lt;ref name="h3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="trt1"/&gt;

Şahika Ercümen is former world record holder of [[Constant weight apnea|constant weight with fins at sea]] (CWT) discipline with {{convert|70|m|ft|abbr=on}} set in [[Dahab]], [[Egypt]] on November 10, 2011 (recognized by [[Confédération Mondiale des Activités Subaquatiques|CMAS]]). The former record belonged to [[Tanya Streeter]] with {{convert|67|m|ft|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="s1"/&gt; The same day at the same place, she set another CMAS-recognized world record diving {{convert|60|m|ft|abbr=on}} deep in [[Variable weight apnea|variable weight apnea without fins at sea]] (VNF).&lt;ref name="s2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cmas"/&gt;

On June 1, 2013, she broke her own world record diving in the VNF discipline to a depth of {{convert|61|m|ft|abbr=on}} in [[saline water|saline]] [[soda water]]s of [[Lake Van]], eastern Turkey (recognized by CMAS).&lt;ref name="s3"/&gt; She stated that she preferred the site for her world-record free-diving attempt because she wanted to call world's attention to the migration of [[Alburnus tarichi|Pearl Mullet]] (Chalcalburnus tarichi), also called Lake Van fish.&lt;ref name="dws"/&gt;

She set a new free-diving world record in the VNF discipline reaching the {{convert|91|m|ft|abbr=on}} depth mark in  2:49 minutes at [[Kaş|Kaş, Antalya]], southern Turkey on July 23, 2014.
