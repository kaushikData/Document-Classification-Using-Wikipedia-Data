'''Accounting Technicians Ireland''' (formerly IATI) is a professional body for Accounting Technicians on the island of [[Ireland]].  They have over 10,000 members and students in the Republic of Ireland and in Northern Ireland.

The organisation was established in 1983 by representatives of the [[Institute of Chartered Accountants in Ireland]] (ICAI) and the Irish Institute of Accounting Technicians (IIAT). Accounting Technicians Ireland was originally called '''The Institute of Accounting Technicians in Ireland'''.

The Accounting Technicians Ireland qualification combines professional exams with practical work experience. The Accounting Technicians Ireland diploma is divided into two parts, each of which is a qualification in its own right:
* Certificate for Accounting Technicians (1 year)
* Diploma for Accounting Technicians (2 years)

As members of the Accounting Technicians Ireland body, individuals are entitled to use the letters MIATI after their name.  After eight years members may be eligible to apply for fellow membership.  Fellow members use the designation FIATI after their name. Other professional accountancy bodies recognise the qualification and offer exemptions from their examination to Accounting Technicians Ireland graduates.

Accounting Technicians Ireland is a not-for-profit organisation.  They are a partner body of Chartered Accountants Ireland and an associate member of the [[International Federation of Accountants]] (IFAC). They have offices in Dublin and Belfast and links with local networks throughout Ireland.

Accounting Technicians Ireland is the trading name for the Institute of Accounting Technicians in Ireland Limited.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accountingtechniciansireland.ie/About_Us/Who_are_Accounting_Technicians_Ireland.html Who are Accounting Technicians Ireland]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accountingtechniciansireland.ie/About_Us/Mission_values.html Accounting Technicians Ireland Mission and Values]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6934">'''Bernard "Bernie" Glieberman''' is an [[United States|American]] [[real estate]] mogul and the president of Crosswinds Communities. Despite having made his fortune in real estate, Glieberman was perhaps best known for, with his son [[Lonie Glieberman|Lonie]], making several unsuccessful and controversial forays into sports team ownership and management in the [[Canadian Football League]].

Glieberman's father died when Glieberman was 17 years old, and after this the young Bernard took over control of his family real estate holdings. By the age of twenty-one he was a partner in a real estate firm, and at thirty-one he was able to buy out his partner's shares. By 1971, he had started the Crosswinds Communities corporation, which he runs and in which he is the sole shareholder to this day.

==Football involvement==

From 1991 to 2006, Glieberman was involved as the financier of several football operations in [[Canada]] and the United States. Glieberman put up the money while Lonie usually handled media relations and football operations.

===The Rough Riders and Shreveport===

In 1991, Glieberman and his son arrived in Ottawa to bail out the troubled [[Ottawa Rough Riders]].  The once-proud team had not had a winning season since 1979.  The franchise was also in dire straits off the field as well as it was over [[Canadian dollar|C$]]1 million in debt. With his son as the franchise's frontman, Bernie bought the team for a dollar, assumed the debt, and provided the capital city's team with what must have seemed like stable ownership.  Their first season, [[1992 Ottawa Rough Riders season|1992]], showed a good deal of promise; the Rough Riders finished 9-9, only their second non-losing season in 13 years.&lt;ref name=CBC1&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/sports/columns/newsmakers/gliebermans.html Back in town again]. [[CBC Sports]], 2005-06-09.&lt;/ref&gt;

It did not take long, though, for the Gliebermans to lose most of the goodwill they had built up.  Before the [[1993 CFL season|1993]], the younger Glieberman fired general manager [[Dan Rambo]], a move that he later called a serious blunder in hindsight.  He then signed former [[National Football League]] [[Pro Bowl]] defensive lineman [[Dexter Manley]], who had been banned from the NFL for life due to [[cocaine]] abuse.  However, Manley had not played a meaningful down of football in almost a year, and it was soon apparent he was nowhere near his old [[Pro Bowl]] form.  When Lonie demanded that the coaches not only keep Manley in the starting lineup, but also bring back a couple of players cut in training camp, assistant coaches [[Jim Daley]] and Mike Roach quit rather than comply. Meanwhile, Bernie made noises about moving the team to the United States, further driving down enthusiasm.&lt;ref name=CBC1/&gt;

When it became apparent that the CFL would not even consider allowing one of the league's oldest franchises to move south of the border, Glieberman reached a deal with the league in which the Rough Riders franchise was split in half.  The Canadian half was sold to [[Bruce Firestone]] for $1.85 million and retained the Rough Riders' name, colours and history.  The American half became the [[Shreveport Pirates]], part of the ill-fated [[CFL USA]] expansion scheme. The Pirates, like the whole expansion, were a failure, going 8-28 over two seasons. Glieberman initially attempted to stay in for the long haul, trying to move the team to [[Norfolk, Virginia]]. However, city officials were put out upon discovering that Glieberman had faced a number of lawsuits over his CFL career for not paying the bills, and that an antique automobile he owned had even been impounded due to his non-payment on a scoreboard for [[Independence Stadium (United States)|Independence Stadium]].

===All-American Football League===
After the failure of his CFL experience, Glieberman tried again in football. In 1997, Glieberman proposed an  All-American Football League with the objective of playing by March 1998. Glieberman planned to play a 20-game season in the spring and summer and make money by having the league sell television advertising rather than the network. The league would have been a single-owner entity, but the teams would have been operated locally.  It also would have signed players before the draft in hopes of controlling costs.&lt;ref&gt;Lombardo, John. [http://www.bizjournals.com/washington/stories/1997/02/03/story3.html New football league may play at RFK]. [[Washington Business Journal]], 1997-02-03.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Return to Ottawa===

In May of [[2005 CFL season|2005]], Glieberman resurfaced in the CFL, purchasing the [[Ottawa Renegades]] after a season in which the league had financed the team. Lonie was once again installed as team president. The Renegades had struggled both financially and in the standings almost since their inception, and owner Bill Smith was sinking in red ink.  He sold majority interest to Glieberman while remaining as a minority owner.  The first move made by the Gliebermans was typically controversial: bringing 71-year-old [[Forrest Gregg]] as head of football operations after the latter had been out of professional football for ten years since his failed tenure as head coach of Glieberman's [[Shreveport Pirates]].  Lonie's [[Mardi Gras]] promotion of trying to lure women to Renegades games by offering them beads (a reward traditionally given in the celebration for the baring of breasts) was also criticized. Before the Renegades' final game of the 2005 season, Lonie announced the firing of popular head coach [[Joe Paopao]] and his staff, leaving them to coach the final game knowing that it would be their last. The Renegades missed the playoffs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/sports/columns/newsmakers/gliebermans2.html Enemy No. 1 in Ottawa]. [[CBC Sports]], 2006-04-09.&lt;/ref&gt;

Claiming $4 million in losses, Glieberman sought a $2 million loan after Smith pulled out.  The league, however, was not willing to agree to this, and put the Renegades up for sale on March 22.  Unable to find a buyer, the league suspended the Renegades' operations on April 9.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060420171316/http://www.tsn.ca/cfl/news_story.asp?ID=161969 CFL suspends operations of Renegades].

'''Building at 419 West Baltimore Street''', also known as Harry Guss Inc., is a historic [[retail]] and [[wholesale]] building located at [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]], [[United States]]. It is a three-story gable-roofed [[Flemish bond]] brick [[Federal architecture|Federal]]-style building built about 1840. Around 1875, a four-bay [[cast iron architecture|cast-iron storefront]] was added at street level.  It was used in the garment manufacturing and sales industries.&lt;ref name="mht_ihp"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mht.maryland.gov/secure/medusa/PDF/NR_PDFs/NR-1132.pdf |title=National Register of Historic Places Registration: Building at 419 West Baltimore Street|date=May 1990|accessdate=2016-03-01 |author=Peter E.

'''Capability management''' is the approach to the management of an organization, typically a business organization or firm, based on the "[[theory of the firm]]" as a collection of capabilities that may be exercised to earn revenues in the marketplace and compete with other firms in the industry. "Capability Management" seeks to manage the stock of capabilities within the firm to ensure its position in the industry and its ongoing profitability and survival.

Prior to the emergence of capability management, the dominant theory explaining the existence and competitive position of firms, based on [[Ricardian economics]], was the [[resource-based view of the firm]] (RBVF). The fundamental thesis of this theory is that firms derive their profitability from their control of resources – and are in competition to secure control of resources. Perhaps the best-known exposition of the Resource-based View of the Firm is that of one of its key originators: economist [[Edith Penrose]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Edith Penrose|title= The Theory of the Growth of the Firm|publisher=New York, John Wiley and Sons|year=1959|isbn=978-0-19-828977-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Capability management" may be regarded as both an extension and alternative to the RBVF that asserts that it is not control over physical resources that is the basis for firm profitability but that "Companies, like individuals, compete on the basis of their ability to create and utilize knowledge;...".&lt;ref&gt;Leonard, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; In short, firms compete not on the basis of control of resources but on the basis of superior [[Know-How]]. This Know-How is embedded in the capabilities of the firm – its abilities to do things that are considered valuable (in and by the market).

==Types of (business) capability==

Leonard defines three types of business capability that a firm might possess: Core Capabilities, Enabling Capabilities and Supplemental Capabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Leonard|first1=Drothy|title=Wellsprings of Knowledge|date=1995|publisher=Harvard Business School Press|isbn=0-87584-612-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Core Capabilities are defined as those "built up over time", that "cannot be easily imitated" and therefore "constitute a competitive advantage for a firm". They are distinct from the other types of capability and sufficiently superior to similar capabilities in competitor organizations to provide a "sustainable competitive advantage". It is implied that such core capabilities are the product of sustained, long [[organizational learning]].

Supplemental Capabilities are defined as those that "add value to core capabilities but that could be imitated".

Enabling Capabilities are defined as those that "are necessary but not sufficient in themselves to competitively distinguish a company." In other words, enabling capabilities are those which a firm has to do, in support of its normal operations and core capabilities, but which are not themselves core capabilities (because they could be imitated, developed quickly or would not be very different from competitors' capabilities). Enabling capabilities are distinguished from supplemental capabilities in that they are required, but do not necessarily add value to core capabilities.

A business capability is ''what'' a company needs to do to execute its [[business strategy]] (e.g., enable ePayments, tailor solutions at point of sale, demonstrate product concepts with customers, combine elastic and non-elastic materials side by side, etc.).

Another way to think about a capability is that it is an assembly of people, process and technology for a specific purpose.&lt;ref&gt;Ric Merrifield, Jack Calhoun and Dennis Stevens "The Next Revolution in Productivity", (''Harvard Business Review'', June, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

Capability Management is the active management, over time, of the portfolio of capabilities in a firm – their development and depreciation in conscious response to changes in the business environment.

Capability management is an approach that uses the organization's customer value proposition to establish performance goals for capabilities based on value contribution. It helps drive out inefficiencies in capabilities that contribute low customer impact and focus efficiencies in areas with high financial leverage; while preserving or investing in capabilities for growth.

==Distinctive capabilities==

Oxford economist [[John Kay (economist)|John Kay]] defines Distinctive Capabilities as those capabilities a firm has which other firms cannot replicate even after they realize what the benefits are that owning the capability confers. These distinctive capabilities are the source or superior performance of successful firms. Kay's Distinctive Capabilities may be identified with Leonard's inimitable and hard-won "Core Capabilities". However, Kay goes further in arguing that in order for a capability to be truly distinctive and the basis for competitive advantage it must meet two further criteria: sustainability and appropriability.

Sustainability refers to the firm maintaining the distinctiveness and superiority of the capability relative to other firms despite their efforts to imitate or replicate it. One approach to sustainability is for the firm to develop the capability faster than the competitors through learning and innovation.

Appropriability refers to the firm securing the benefits of the capability – or the exercising of its capability – for itself as opposed to those benefits accruing to the firm's customers, its staff – management or employees, or its shareholders, regulators or other stakeholders. [[Intellectual Property Rights]] are one means for securing appropriability.

On the basis of analysis of empirical data regarding the performance of companies Kay argues that there are only a few types of distinctive capability that meet the additional criteria. Three are said to recur in the analysis: Innovation, Architecture and Reputation. These are briefly discussed below.

==Capability or competency?==

In a 1990 edition of the [[Harvard Business Review]], [[Gary Hamel]] and [[C.K.Prahalad]] published an article entitled "The Core Competence of the Corporation" which defined the notion of  a "[[core competency]]". Core Competencies are identified by three criteria: 1) they are difficult for competitors to imitate 2) they make a substantial contribution to a number of the firm's products (or services) they give the firm access to several markets and 3) they make a substantial contribution to the perceived customer-value of the products (or services). The (superior) competitive position of the firm's products (or services) in its markets is thought to be the expression of the firm's competitive advantage. Hamel and Prahald go on to assert that core competencies are the result of "collective learning across the corporation".

Since that publication there has been active debate in the academic literature as to whether (the concept of) "core competencies" is the same notion as core capabilities.  Several authors consider that the concepts are the same, the differences purely terminological, and use the terms interchangeably while others insist there is a substantive distinction. Given the similarities in their definitions it is a reasonable position to think they are the same. However, neither Leonard, nor Hamel and Prahalad (nor indeed Kay) were philosophically precise enough in their definitions and expositions of the concepts for the identity to be definitively established. One reasonable position is that "core competencies" are a view of "core capabilities" from a customers and products perspective while "core capabilities" are a view of "core competencies" from the perspective of knowledge and skills and staff and suppliers in firms. This may reflect the philosophical biases of their respective institutions.

Others, such as [[Max Boisot]], take the view that competence or competency is some measure of the level of performance in a capability or that competence is a much narrower concept than capability. Hence a firm may have a high or low level of competence in a particular, notional, abstract capability. There is some evidence that general managers often fail to appreciate the subtlety of the definition of "core competencies" and over-estimate the degree of their firm's competence in common capabilities. Consequently, they over-identify "things the firm is good at" as core competencies – which falls foul of the distinctiveness criterion for a core capability (and/or the inimitability criterion of core competencies and core capabilities). Hence some things managers mistakenly identify as "core competencies" may be more properly considered as Enabling or Supplemental Capabilities.

When applying the concepts of "core competence" or "core capability" academics and practitioners should be clear and precise as to their intended semantics for these ambiguous terms.

==Structure of a capability -or- dimensions of a core capability==

Leonard analyzes the nature of a (business) capability and concludes that core capabilities "comprise at least four interdependent dimensions" (pp.&amp;nbsp;19) as follows:
# Physical technical systems – machinery, databases, software systems etc.
# Managerial systems – systems for the management of operations, including operation of technical systems
# Skills and Knowledge (systems) – systems for the maintenance of personal and team skills and knowledge
# Values and Norms – systems for the regulation of behaviours and objectives in organizations
[[File:Dimensions of a Core Capability.jpg|thumb|right|Dimensions of a Core Capability]]
Around this complex of systems that realize a core capability Leonard situates a loop "Capability-Creating Activities" that comprise "Shared Problem Solving" and encompass Present and Future and Internal and External Perspectives (see Leonard, 1995, chapter 3). This capability development loop, is considered a system of organizational learning (knowledge-creating and knowledge-diffusing activities) and comprises the following activities:
#Problem Solving (in the context of the PRESENT)
#Implementing and Integrating (in the INTERNAL context)
#Experimenting (in the context of the FUTURE)
#Importing Knowledge (from the EXTERNAL context)
These activities, however, do not form a simple cycle or sequence and may be conducted in any order and several "in parallel" around any particular capability. It is these knowledge-creating and knowledge-diffusing (or knowledge-acquiring and knowledge-sharing) activities that make the capability dynamic (change over time) in the Leonard model.

Clearly, Leonard takes a [[System-of-Systems]] perspective on organizational or business or enterprise capabilities – and this establishes the link to the notion of a [[Capability (systems engineering)|Capability]] in [[Systems Engineering]]. Given that the Leonard model of a capability incorporates elements of skills and knowledge, and is adaptive and intelligent in the sense of importing knowledge from the external context, experimenting and problem-solving, while moving from present to future, it may be considered an ICASOS – an Intelligent Complex Adaptive System-of-Systems – model of an enterprise or firm. Note that the knowledge created and diffused in the Leonard model is organizational knowledge, not personal knowledge and is Know-How, not Know-That, that is often [[Tacit Knowledge]].

According to Hadaya and Gagnon, in their book ''Business Architecture - The Missing Link is Strategy Formulation, Implementation and Execution'', a business capability is an integrated set of resources designed to work together to achieve a particular result&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/989865288|title=Business architecture : the missing link in strategy formulation, implementation and execution|last=Hadaya|first=Pierre|last2=Gagnon|first2=Bernard|publisher=ASATE Publishing|year=2017|isbn=9780994931900|location=Montréal|pages=59-60|oclc=989865288}}&lt;/ref&gt;. A capability is always made up of one or more business functions, business processes, organizational units, know-how assets, information assets and technology assets. ″For example, to have the capability to Fabricate Metal Parts, an organization must have the necessary machines (technology assets), the knowledge of how to operate them (know-how assets), the specific sequence of activities needed to fabricate the parts (process), the drawings of the parts to be fabricated (information assets), and the teams of people (organizational units) specializing in the various types of fabrication required to make the parts (business functions)″&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. According to these authors, some capabilities also include one or more brands or natural resource deposits. Indeed, ″the Coca Cola Company could not sell 1.9 billion servings a day in more than 200 countries were it not for the power of its brands″&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. In turn, for a farmer to be able to Produce Vegetables, he must have not only the right business functions, business processes, organizational units, know-how assets, information assets and technology assets, but also a piece of land (natural resource deposit) on which to grow his vegetables. A business capability can also be made up of lower-level capabilities. For example, to have the capability to manufacture cars, an organization must have several lower-level capabilities, including the capability to manufacture engines and the capability to fabricate and assemble the bodywork of the cars.

The consideration of a portfolio of capabilities in an enterprise in the context of the PRESENT and FUTURE contexts, with the Importing of Knowledge from the EXTERNAL context and the Implementing and Integrating of Knowledge in the INTERNAL context, establishes the link to [[Enterprise Architecture]]. In Enterprise Architecture this knowledge and planning of present-to-future evolution is diffused through the medium of models shared and used throughout the enterprise.

==Dynamic capabilities theory==
The Leonard model of a Capability is a dynamic model at the micro-level; focused on the detailed mechanisms for development and change of individual capabilities. Building on the work of Hamel and Prahalad, and others [[David Teece]] and colleagues developed a macro-level theory of [[Dynamic capabilities]] and framework for their management. In this theory a (or perhaps ''the'') "Dynamic Capability" is defined as "the firm’s ability to integrate, build, and reconfigure internal and external competences to address rapidly changing environments."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Teece, D., Pisano, G., &amp; Shuen, A.|title=Dymamic Capabilities and Strategic Management|journal=Strategic Management Journal|date=1997|volume=18|issue=7|doi=10.1002/(sici)1097-0266(199708)18:7&lt;509::aid-smj882&gt;3.0.co;2-z }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Building on earlier work from the 1960s, the central thesis of the Dynamic Capabilities theory is that "... the real key to a company's success or even to its future development lies in its ability to find or create a competence that is truly distinctive". In this literature the term "competence" is used in both the sense of degree of performance in some capability and as a low-level, short-term capability. Competence in the latter sense echoes the concepts from Hamel and Prahalad, but may also be identified with Leonard's Enabling and Supplemental Capabilities as well as the short-term Core Capabilities of a firm. The term "capabilities" is also used somewhat interchangeably with "competencies".

The competencies or low-level capabilities are regarded as assets or knowledge-resources of the enterprise, alongside physical assets and other resources that are difficult for competitor firms to acquire. In this sense Teece's Dynamic Capabilities Theory is a move back towards the Resource-Based View of the Firm, but with a broader notion of "Resources" that includes intangible knowledge-based and practice-based resources, not just tangible assets. In the Dynamic Capabilities Theory, "Resources" are firm-specific assets that are difficult for competitors to acquire or imitate, "Organizational Routines" (based on prior work of Nelson and Winter) or "Organizational Competences" are the low-level capabilities of the firm and "Core Competences" are taken from the Hamel and Prahalad concept. Citing Dorothy Leonard (or Leonard-Barton), Teece et al. define (higher-level) Dynamic Capabilities as the "ability to integrate, build and reconfigure" these tangible and intangible assets.
"Dynamic Capabilities thus reflect an organizations ability to achieve new and innovative forms of competitive advantage given path dependencies and market positions."

"Path dependencies" refers to the history of development of organizational knowledge embedded in its capabilities, routines and technological assets – echoing the concept from Leonard, but on a macro-scale and explaining why competitive advantage takes time and persistence to build. The incorporation of "Routines" and path-dependent development of firms in the theory establishes the link to evolutionary theories of management and (business) strategy.

The Dynamic Capabilities Theory also refers to notions of coherence, congruence and complementary assets across the firms portfolio of assets, routines, competencies and capabilities. This has resonances with similar notions of coherence in [[System-of-Systems Engineering]] and in [[Enterprise Architecture]].

Teece et al. also discuss Technological Assets, Structural Assets and Reputational Assets – echoing the three recurrent categories of Distinctive Capability identified by John Kay – Innovation, Architecture and Reputation. The discussion of technological assets and technology-based competences establishes the link to [[Technology Management]] and [[Technology Strategy]]. Teece et al. also discuss organizational structure, market/industry structure, organizational boundaries, notions of co-specialization in assets, cross-firm integration and the trade-offs between hierarchical management control and a nexus of contracts. This presages notions of the "[[Virtual Enterprise]]" or "Extended Enterprise" and establishes the link to [[Enterprise Architecture]].

It can be seen therefore that Dynamic Capabilities Theory is a highly integrative theory of the firm that links a wide range of fields including Business Strategy, Strategic Management, Knowledge Management, Technology Management, Technology Strategy, Systems Thinking, Enterprise Architecture or Enterprise Engineering and others.

From the perspective of Dynamic Capabilities Theory, Capability Management is the approach to management that focuses on the development of the portfolio of capabilities (resources, assets, routines, knowledge etc.) available to the firm, and the meta level capability of reconfiguring them and integrating them for market exploitation and competitive advantage.

==Capability management in defence==

[[Capability management in defence]] has a history dating back to the early years of the 21st Century.
The [[UK Ministry of Defence]] adapted the existing [[DoDAF]] architecture framework to the procurement practices of what was then the MOD Procurement Executive, later Defence Equipment and Support, – in particular a [[Capability management]] approach to Defence procurement called "Through-Life Capability Management" (TLCM). The DoDAF was extended with additional 'Views' for capability planning and notions of capability configurations and capability increments. These views were standard ways to represent how the capabilities in some segment of the Defence Enterprise (such as the Army, Navy or Air Force) were expected to or planned to evolve over time, given investments by MOD and the UK Government. This was published in 2004 as the MOD Architecture Framework ([[MODAF]]) version 1.0. The current, and probably last, version of MODAF is 1.4. This will be the last version since MOD intends to migrate to the forthcoming new version of the [[NATO Architecture Framework]], which incorporates much from MODAF, including the concepts and views of capability planning. The notion of capability in MODAF, however, is slightly different from the notion of capability in, for example, Dynamic Capabilities Theory.

In MODAF "Capability" refers to a ''military'' capability – an ability to produce military effects – or enabling or supporting capabilities. Nevertheless, the central thesis that politico-military conflicts or business competitions in markets are contests in which the organisation or enterprise with the superior capabilities wins holds. On this basis the same capability-based strategy and planning techniques are thought to be effective in both spheres.

The aim of "Through-Life Capability Management" (TLCM) was to promote in defence procurement a shift of perspective away from a focus on military equipment towards what was really required from UK Defence organizations: the capabilities, or abilities to produce effects in the world that enhance UK national security. The MOD considers that such capabilities are delivered by trans-organisation networks of operational units across the Defence Enterprise – and hence uses the terminology "[[Network Enabled Capability]]" (NEC). This is (a part of) MOD's interpretation of the concept of [[Network Centric Warfare]] which itself was a 1990s interpretation of a [[System-Of-Systems]] approach or perspective in the context of Defence.

The earlier cultural focus on equipment had led to over-specification, incoherent equipment purchases, unnecessary duplication, an over-emphasis on initial purchase costs, insufficient consideration of recurrent support and maintenance costs, project and programme delays and significant cost overruns that the UK Government could no longer tolerate. TLCM promoted a capability lifecycle perspective, that sought a balanced investment profile in time that would minimise whole-life costs, while efficiently producing effective, coherent and maximally cost-effective Defence capabilities over the medium term – and thereby ensuring maximum Value-for-Money for the UK taxpayer from Defence. TLCM was therefore central to the strategic planning of the evolution of the UK Defence Enterprise. While formally superseded, elements of TLCM live on in MOD's whole-systems, non-equipment-centric System-Of-Systems Approach, which was mandated in UK Defence Strategic Direction in 2013.

==Capability management and enterprise architecture==

Capability-based planning had long been entrenched in the Defense realm in the US, UK, Australia, and Canada before it was adopted within Version 9 of [[The Open Group Architecture Framework|The Open Group Architecture Framework (TOGAF)]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://pubs.opengroup.org/architecture/togaf9-doc/arch/chap32.html#tag_32_02 | title =Capability-Based Planning Paradigm | date =2011 | publisher =[[The Open Group]] | access-date =18 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Capability Management has in recent years become a popular sub-discipline or method of [[Enterprise Architecture]]. Enterprise Architecture seeks to build a rigorous model of an enterprise that identifies its component parts and their relationships for the purpose of planning the evolution of the enterprise. A Capability Management perspective – such as Leonard's model or Teece's Dynamic Capabilities Theory – suggests that a firm is best viewed as a collection of capabilities that have a composition from and configuration of the tangible and intangible assets of the firm. In this view the firm and its portfolio of capabilities evolve in response to the (perceived) demands of the business environment. An enterprise may comprise one or more firms, or parts of firms (or other types of organization) and their interrelationships – and so is describable (may be modelled) in the same terms.

In the IBM Enterprise Architecture Method, the "Enterprise Capabilities Neighborhood" – a segment of the overall Enterprise Architecture description or model – "captures the strategic intent of the enterprise". It "provides the bridge from the organization's strategy to the architectural building blocks that enable and realize the strategy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Doucet |editor-first=G. |editor2-last=Gotze |editor2-first=J. |editor3-last=Saha |editor3-first=P. |editor4-last=Bernard |editor4-first=S.|last=Collins |first=F.C. |last2=De Meo |first2=P.|chapter=Realizing the Business Value of Enterprise Architecture through Architecture Building Blocks|title=Coherency Management – Architecting the Enterprise for Alignment, Agility and Assurance|date=2011|publisher=AuthorHouse|isbn=978-1-4389-9606-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the IBM EA Method, "Both the Enterprise Capabilities and Business Architecture are technology independent." It is not clear how this view can be rationalised and made coherent with the Leonard model or the Teece theory which places some technology-implemented system at the center of a capability. Collins and De Meo go on to assert that "To focus the EA (description) on delivering the right plan for the enterprise, it must be based on a detailed understanding of the Enterprise Capabilities the enterprise has decided it needs...". Collins and De Meo's "Enterprise Capabilities" can thus be identified with Leonard's "Core Capabilities". The IBM EA Method defines the "Strategic Capability Network" which "depicts the strategic capabilities and associated enablers of a business, their interrelationships and their combined roles and significance in ... the value net of a business." The SCN is therefore a modeling technique and [[network theory|network analysis]] method that expresses both the Leonard model of Core, Enabling and Supplemental capabilities, the Hamel and Prahalad notion of core competencies and, given EA's time dimension of enterprise evolution, the Dynamic Capabilities Theory.

==Capability management topics==

===Capability vs. process===
A process is ''how'' the capability is executed. Much of the reengineering revolution or [[Business process reengineering]] focused on how to redesign business processes.

===Business vs. organizational capability===
An organization capability refers to the potential of the people in an organization and their [[cooperation]] to get things done.&lt;ref&gt;Dave Ulrich and Norn Smallwood, How Leaders Build Value: Using People, Organization, and Other Intangibles to Get Bottom-Line Results (Jossey-Bass, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;  The way leaders foster shared mindset, talent, change, accountability, and collaboration across boundaries define the company's culture and leadership edge.

===Capability vs. competency===
[[Dave Ulrich]] makes a distinction between capabilities and [[competence (human resources)|competencies]]: individuals have competencies while organizations have capabilities.  Both competencies and capabilities have technical and social elements.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
!  !! Individual !! Organization
|-
| Technical|| Functional Competencies|| Business Capabilities
|-
| Social|| Leadership Competencies|| Organizational Capabilities
|}

At the individual-technical intersection, employees in the firm bring functional skills and competencies such as programming, cost accounting, electrical engineering, etc. At the individual-social intersection, leaders also have a set of competencies or skills such as setting the strategic agenda and building relationships. Moving to the intersection of organizational and technical, are business capabilities. In short, they are the technical things or what the firm must know how to do to execute strategy. For example, a financial service firm must know how to manage risk and design innovative products.
Finally, we have organization capabilities such a talent management, collaboration, and accountability. They integrate all the other parts of the firm and bring it together. When leaders have mastered certain competencies, organization capabilities become visible. For example, when a leaders master "turning vision in to action" and "aligning the organization," the organization a whole shows more [[accountability]].

==History of capability modeling in business==
Capability management's earlier ancestors include the [[value chain]], also known as value chain analysis, first described and popularized by [[Michael Porter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|year=1985 |title=Competitive Advantage: Creating and Sustaining Superior Performance}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[core competency|Core competencies]] (also called core capabilities) are what give a company one or more competitive advantages in creating and delivering value to its customers in its chosen field, a cluster of extraordinary abilities or the [[excellence]] that a firm acquires from its founders, and which cannot be easily imitated.

Lee Perry, Randall Stott and Norm Smallwood&lt;ref&gt;Lee Perry, Randall Stott and Norm Smallwood ''Real Time Strategy'' (Wiley 1993)&lt;/ref&gt; added to the capabilities body of work the concepts of strategic options based on customer value proposition and business focus&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin B. Tregoe and John W. Zimmerman ''Top Management Strategy'' (Simon &amp; Schuster, 1980) Business Focus builds on the work of the "driving force" and "nine strategic areas" and how they suggest capabilities needed.&lt;/ref&gt; and types of work which characterized work as either:

* Unit of competitive advantage (UCA) – the work and capabilities that create distinctiveness for the business in the marketplace
* Value-added support work – the work and capabilities that facilitate the UCA
* Essential support work – the work that doesn't support UCA or facilitate it but must be done to operate the business

Building on earlier themes, the concept of [[dynamic capabilities]] was introduced in 2000. The basic assumption of the dynamic capabilities framework is that in fast changing markets, firms need to respond quickly and innovatively.

Around the same time, Richard Lynch, John Diezemann and James Dowling extended the concepts above in ''The Capable Company: Building the capabilities that make strategy work''.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Lynch, John Diezemann and James Dowling, ''The Capable Company: Building the capabilities that make strategy work'' (Wiley-Blackwell, 2003)&lt;/ref&gt; Key additions to the body of work were tools to translate strategic shifts to new sets of capabilities required whether these were core competencies or not. Building on the types of work ideas, the authors added performance target setting based on the capability value contribution. When compared to actual performance, the method outlined an approach to identify capability gaps and priorities. They also laid out a framework to continually align capabilities based on strategy shifts and external changes through the project agenda. The first full capability model was built by the authors in 2001 as the framework for the demerger of Intercontinental Hotels Group (then known as Six Continents) from the parent Six Continents PLC (formerly Bass &amp; Co Brewery).&lt;ref&gt;James Larson and Richard Lynch, "Reinventing a Hotel Company" (''BPM Connections'', October/November 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; The model included thee levels of capabilities, value contribution, performance targets, capability gaps, recommended actions and sourcing decisions.

In 2004, the [[UK Ministry of Defence]] released its [[enterprise architecture framework]], [[MODAF]]. This framework extended the existing [[DoDAF]] specification by adding views for capability planning. These views were standard ways to represent how the enterprise was expected to perform over time, expressed in terms of capabilities.

Other important contributions include the concept of value maps for detailing the customer proposition and more recently the profit proposition to identify capabilities that will help create [[Blue Ocean Strategy]]. Value maps extend the work of real-time strategy and the capable company by depicting a strategy canvas and providing an action framework to capture markets. In the mid-2000s, a team at Microsoft, in concert with Accelare, developed the motion methodology – a capability-based framework.&lt;ref&gt;Ric Merrifield, ''Rethink: What do you need to do today?'' (FT Press, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, Ric Merrifield, Jack Calhoun and Dennis Stevens, in "The Next Revolution in Productivity" added the use of SOA and its role in supporting capability delivery at breakthrough cost and speed.&lt;ref&gt;Ric Merrifield, Jack Calhoun and Dennis Stevens "The Next Revolution in Productivity", (''Harvard Business Review'', June, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  Also introduced was the use of heats maps for capability analyses.

==Capability management frameworks==
A complete picture of the capabilities is the enterprise capability model.&lt;ref&gt;''Capability-Based Management'' (White Paper from Accelare, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; It is a blueprint for the business expressed in terms of the capabilities necessary to execute strategy including delivery of services. Capabilities are described in levels of abstraction; usually three levels of details:

* Family of capabilities; often shown as [[chevron (insignia)|chevron]]s
* Groups of capabilities; illustrated in the health care provider diagram
* Specific capabilities; the level of detail to assess capabilities

At the higher level, are the attributes of ownership, location, and project road maps. The lower level is where the action is and where performance targets are set, performance assessed and gaps noted. It is at this level sourcing decisions are made or projects established to close gaps. The framework includes strategic, core and enabling capabilities.

* Strategic capabilities: capabilities in organizational planning, strategy, and investment
* Core capabilities: the inventory of business capabilities that are identified as delivering the products and services that an organization offers to its market.
*  Enabling capabilities: the inventory of business capabilities that are required to support them but not sold or offered to the market

===Strategic planning===
Companies like Harvard Pilgrim Health Care&lt;ref&gt;Jack Calhoun, Richard Lynch and Jim Dowling, "The Cost-Take-Out Challenge",  (www.accelare.com).&lt;/ref&gt; and Intercontinental Hotels Group&lt;ref&gt;James Larson and Richard Lynch, "Reinventing a Hotel Company"(October/November 2004 issue of ''BPM Connections'')&lt;/ref&gt; have used capabilities to focus on where to take out costs and outsource non strategic capabilities while improving service and adding brands.

===IT–business alignment===
Microsoft is using capability models to enter into conversations with clients to identify capability and process pain points to better align IT solutions to the business.[http://www.microsoft.com/applicationplatform/about/applicationplatformoptimization.mspx%20%20Microsoft%20APO%5D]

===New growth platforms===
Capabilities are also being used in new [[growth platforms|growth platform]] development.&lt;ref&gt;Donald L.  Laurie, Claude Sheer and Yves Doz, "New Growth Platforms" (''Harvard Business Review'', May 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Platforms are a foundation that spawns multiple products and/or services that, by themselves, are eventually the size of a business unit.&lt;ref&gt;Leander Kahney, "Straight Dope on the IPod's Birth" (''Wired'', October 17, 2006) illustrates this concept well.&lt;/ref&gt; These innovations result from identifying new domains created at the intersection of enablers or "unstoppable trends" and customer dynamics, linked to an essential set of core capabilities called the platform logic: those capabilities that are unique, valuable, and portable.

==Capability value contribution==
Building of the earlier type of work logic, Accelare added a distinction in assessment of the capabilities necessary to operative the business by examining the financial impact as well as the customer impact.&lt;ref&gt;Jack Calhoun, Richard Lynch and Jim Dowling, ''The Cost-Take-Out Challenge'', (Accelare, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

::::'''Figure 3: Capability value contribution to strategy'''
[[File:Capability Value Contribution.jpg]]

Some capabilities directly contribute to the customer value proposition and have a high impact on company financials. These "advantage capabilities" are shown in the upper right. Value contribution is assured when performance is among the best in peer organizations at acceptable cost. Keep them inside and protect the intellectual property. Moving to the top left quadrant, strategic support capabilities have high contribution in direct support of advantage capabilities. Keep them close. Value contribution is assured when performed above industry parity at competitive cost. Other capabilities shown in the bottom right are essential. They may not be visible to the customer but contribute to company's business focus and have a big impact on the bottom line.  Focus on efficiency improvement; especially in high volume work.  Value contribution is assured when performed at industry parity performance below competitors' cost. Other capabilities are "business necessity". Value contribution is assured when performed at industry parity performance below competitors' costs. They can be candidates for alternate sourcing.

==Gap analysis and heat maps==
A capability gap assessment can be portrayed in a [[heat map]].

* A heat map is a visualization of which capabilities required attention.
* A heat index is calculated using effectiveness and efficiency scores and the gap between targeted and actual performance; high heat (red/orange) in the gap column suggests investment.

Capability value contribution helps stack rank investments, for example advantage capabilities with high heat move to the top of the agenda, followed by business essential capabilities with large inefficiencies.

{{Environmental law}}
'''Clean Tech Law''' contemplates a diverse set of legal and policy issues related to the development and commercialization of [[clean technology]]. These issues range from conventional [[natural resources]] law to cutting-edge [[intellectual property]] issues related to [[synthetic genomics]] and advanced materials.  Clean tech law could also address issues and conflicts surrounding the placement of such technologies (e.g., glare from solar panels).

==History==
The term clean tech, or cleantech, is short for [[clean technology]]. The abbreviated use of the term first appeared on October 10, 1990 in the [[Xinhua General News Service]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110315064606/http://cleantechlawandbusiness.com/cleanbeta/index.php/60/the-etymology-of-cleantech/ CleanBeta, What is CleanTech?]&lt;/ref&gt; Now, clean tech, is generally considered to include multiple advanced technologies in four economic sectors: [[energy]], [[water]], [[Raw material|material]]s, and [[transportation]]. These technologies break down in the following categories:

* Energy Generation
* Energy Storage
* Energy Infrastructure
* Energy Efficiency
* Transportation
* Water &amp; Wastewater
* Air &amp; Environment
* Materials
* Manufacturing/Industrial
* Agriculture
* Recycling &amp; Waste&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071011205528/http://cleantechnetwork.com/index.cfm?pageSRC=CleantechDefined Clean Tech Network]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Basic issues==
As a discrete legal field, clean tech law is in its infancy and so vaguely defined that it focuses as much on more familiar areas like liability and ownership as it does [[business models]] and corporate strategies. The transactional side of clean tech law revolved around development and commercializing of new technologies in [[renewable energy]], [[pollution]], and other frontiers in the fight against [[climate change]] and protection of natural resources, and the creation of green jobs. In addition, the basic economics are inseparable from substantive social and ethical issues posed by these emerging technologies. The more traditional legal areas of [[clean technology]] law include [[intellectual property]], [[patent law]], licensing, [[litigation]], and federal and state [[legislative]], [[landuse]] and regulatory issues.

'''David Barioni''' Neto (born November 14, 1958) is CEO (president) of São Paulo Turismo S.A and since August 2018 is also Tourism secretary of the city of São Paulo. 

Previously, Barioni was CEO of Ageo Terminais Aeroportuários, Apex-Brasil (the Brazilian Trade and Investment Promotion Agency&lt;ref name="Exame2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://exame.abril.com.br/negocios/noticias/apex-sera-presidida-por-david-barioni-ex-presidente-da-tam|title=Apex será presidida por David Barioni, ex-presidente da TAM|publisher=''Exame''|accessdate=May 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IstoÉ2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.istoedinheiro.com.br/blogs-e-colunas/post/20151112/barioni-quer-acelerar-apex/7780|title=Barioni quer acelerar a Apex|publisher=''IstoÉ''|accessdate=May 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ), Facility Group S.A. and [[TAM Airlines]] and also VP of [[Gol Airlines]].&lt;ref name="Estadão"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://economia.estadao.com.br/noticias/negocios,bologna-deixa-comando-da-tam-david-barioni-assume,87366 |title=Bologna deixa comando da TAM, David Barioni assume| publisher=''Estadão''|accessdate=May 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UOL Economia"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://economia.uol.com.br/ultnot/2007/11/28/ult4294u877.jhtm |title=Bologna deixa comando da TAM, David Barioni assume| publisher=''UOL Economia''|accessdate=May 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Barioni started his career as a pilot in 1976, at the age of 18. During his career as a pilot, Barioni flew aircraft models such as [[Boeing 737]], [[MD-11]], [[Boeing 777-300ER]] and was an [[Airbus A300]] co-pilot.&lt;ref name="Economia IG 2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://economia.ig.com.br/david+barioni+neto+estreia+coluna+no+ig/n1237561389999.html |title=David Barioni Neto estreia coluna no iG| publisher=''Economia IG''|accessdate=May 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Terra"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.terra.com.br/istoedinheiro-temp/edicoes/584/imprime118312.htm|title=Empreendedor do ano transportes – David Barioni|publisher=''Terra''|accessdate=May 19, 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160408155840/http://www.terra.com.br/istoedinheiro-temp/edicoes/584/imprime118312.htm|archivedate=April 8, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Capitalism |expanded=Ideologies}}
'''Dirigisme''' or '''dirigism''' ({{ety|fr|diriger|to direct}}) is an economic doctrine in which the state plays a strong directive role, as opposed to a merely [[Regulation|regulatory]] role, over a [[capitalist]] [[market economy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/dirigisme ''Dirigisme''] Oxford Dictionaries. Retrieved 25 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; As an economic doctrine, dirigisme is the counterpart to [[laissez-faire]], stressing a positive role for state intervention in curbing productive inefficiencies and [[market failure]]s. Dirigiste policies often include [[indicative planning]], state-directed investment, and the use of market instruments (taxes and subsidies).

The term emerged in the [[Aftermath of World War II|post-war]] era to describe the economic policies of [[France]], which included substantial state-directed investment, the use of [[Indicative planning|indicative economic planning]] to supplement the [[market mechanism]], and the establishment of [[state enterprise]]s in strategic domestic sectors. It resulted in an unprecedented [[economic]] and [[demography|demographic]] growth, leading to the coinage of the term ''[[Trente Glorieuses]]'' ("Thirty Glorious [years]").

The term has subsequently been used to classify other economies that pursued similar policies, most notably the [[Four Asian Tigers|East Asian tiger economies]], and more recently the economy of the [[People's Republic of China]].&lt;ref name="Models of dirigisme in East Asia: perspectives from Eastern Europe, 1996"&gt;''Models of dirigisme in East Asia: perspectives from Eastern Europe'', by Dragsbæk Schmidt, Johannes. 1996. Between Western Europe and East Asia, p. 196-216, {{ISBN|0333666046}}&lt;/ref&gt; A related concept is [[state capitalism]].

Most modern economies can be characterized as ''dirigiste'' to some degree&amp;nbsp;– for instance, the state may exercise directive action by performing or subsidizing research and development of new technologies, through government procurement (especially [[military]]) or through state-run research institutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.publicfinanceinternational.org/features/2013/06/the-myth-of-the-meddling-state-nothing-ventured/ |title=The Myth of the "Meddling" State |author=Mariana Mazzucato |date=June 25, 2013 |publisher=Public Finance International |accessdate=January 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In France==
{{refimprove section|date=May 2013}}
Before the [[Second World War]], France had a relatively fragmented [[capitalism|capitalist]] economic system. The many small companies, often family-owned, were often not dynamic and efficient{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} in comparison to the large industrial groups in [[Germany]] or the [[United States]]. The Second World War laid waste to France. Railroads and industries were destroyed by aerial [[bombardment]] and [[sabotage]]; industries were seized by Nazi Germany; in the immediate postwar years loomed the spectre of long years of [[rationing]] (such as the one enforced in the [[United Kingdom]]). Some sections of the French business and political world lost authority after [[Vichy France|collaborating with the German occupiers]].

Post-war French governments, from whichever political side, generally sought rational, efficient economic development, with the long-term goal of matching the highly developed and technologically advanced economy of the [[United States]]. The development of French dirigisme coincided with the development of [[meritocracy|meritocratic]] [[Technocracy (bureaucratic)|technocracy]]: the [[École Nationale d'Administration]] supplied the state with high-level administrators, while leadership positions in industry were staffed with [[Corps of Mines (France)|Corps of Mines]] state engineers and other personnel trained at the [[École Polytechnique]].

During the 1945–1975 period, France experienced unprecedented [[economic growth]] (5.1% on average) and a [[demography|demographic]] boom, leading to the coinage of the term ''[[Trente Glorieuses]]'' ("Thirty Glorious [years]").

Dirigisme flourished under the [[right-wing|centre-right]] governments of [[Charles de Gaulle]] and [[Georges Pompidou]]. In those times, the policy was viewed as a middle way between the American policy of little state involvement and the Soviet policy of total state control. In 1981, [[French Socialist Party|Socialist]] president [[François Mitterrand]] was elected, promising greater [[state enterprise]] in the economy; his government soon [[nationalization|nationalised]] industries and banks. However, in 1983 the initial bad economic results forced the government to renounce dirigisme and start the era of ''rigueur'' ("rigour"). Dirigisme has remained out of favour with subsequent governments, though some of its traits remain.

===Indicative planning===
The main French tool under dirigisme was [[indicative planning]] through plans designed by the ''Commissariat général du plan'' ("Commission for the Plan"). Indicative planning used various incentives to induce public and private actors to behave in an optimal fashion, with the plan serving as a general guideline for optimal investment. During this period France never ceased to be a capitalist economy directed by the [[accumulation of capital]], profit-maximizing enterprise and [[Market economy|market-based allocation]] of producer goods.

In contrast to [[Soviet-type economic planning|Soviet-type central planning]] practiced in the former [[Eastern bloc|Soviet bloc]], where economic planning substituted market allocation and operated the factors of production according to a binding plan, the French state never owned more than a minority of industry and did not seek to replace markets with planning. The idea of dirigisme is to complement and improve the efficiency of the market through indirect planning intended to provide better information to market participants. This concept is held in contrast to a planned economy, which aims to replace market-based allocation of production and investment with a binding plan of production expressed in units of physical quantities.

===State ownership===
Because French industry prior to the Second World War was weak due to fragmentation, the French government encouraged mergers and the formation of "[[national champions]]": large industry groups backed by the state.

Two areas where the French government sought greater control were in [[infrastructure]] and the transportation system. The French government owned the national railway company [[SNCF]], the national electricity utility [[Electricité de France|EDF]], the national natural gas utility [[Gaz de France|GDF]], the national airline [[Air France]]; [[France Télécom|phone]] and [[La Poste (France)|postal]] services were operated as the [[Postes, télégraphes et téléphones (France)|PTT]] administration. The government chose to devolve the construction of most [[Freeway|autoroutes]] (freeways) to semi-private companies rather than to administer them itself. Other areas where the French government directly intervened were defense, nuclear and aerospace industries ([[Aérospatiale]]).

This development was marked by ''volontarisme'', the belief that difficulties (e.g. postwar devastation, lack of natural resources) could be overcome through willpower and ingenuity. For instance, following the [[1973 energy crisis]], the saying "In France we don't have oil, but we have ideas" was coined. Volontarisme emphasized [[modernization]], resulting in a variety of ambitious state plans. Examples of this trend include the extensive use of [[nuclear power|nuclear energy]] (close to 80% of French electrical consumption), the [[Minitel]], an early online system for the masses, and the [[TGV]], a [[high-speed rail]] network.

==Other economies with dirigiste characteristics==
Economic dirigisme has been described as an inherent aspect of [[fascist]] economies by Hungarian author, [[Iván T. Berend]] in his book ''An Economic History of Twentieth-Century Europe''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Iván T. Berend]], An Economic History of Twentieth-Century Europe, Cambridge University Press, 2005, p. 93&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Fascist systems created by [[Benito Mussolini]] ([[Italy]]), [[António de Oliveira Salazar|António Salazar]] ([[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Portugal]]), [[Francisco Franco]] ([[Spain]]) and [[Adolf Hitler]] ([[Germany]]) are a varied mix of elements from numerous philosophies, including: [[nationalism]], [[authoritarianism]], [[militarism]], [[corporatism]], [[collectivism]], [[totalitarianism]], and [[anti-communism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Baker|first=David|date=June 2006|title=The political economy of fascism: Myth or reality, or myth and reality?|journal=New Political Economy|volume=11|issue=2|pages=227–250|doi=10.1080/13563460600655581}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dirigisme has been brought up as a politico-economic scheme at odds with ''laissez-faire'' capitalism in the context of French overseas holdings. Countries such as Lebanon and Syria have been influenced by this motif&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailystar.com.lb/article.asp?edition_id=10&amp;categ_id=4&amp;article_id=86003 The Daily Star] - 'Youssef Chaitani's 'Post-Colonial Syria and Lebanon' chronicles the history of division between the neighbors', 17 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt; to varying degrees throughout the post-colonial period.

The economies of the East Asian tigers are sometimes characterised as being "dirigiste" due to the strong role played by the state in [[Developmental state|development planning]] and guiding investment.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}. 
Dirigisme is also seen in [[India]]. The state has complete control and ownership of railways; majority control and stake in banking, insurance, electricity, and oil and gas industries; and has substantial control over telecommunication, port and shipping industries.&lt;ref name="EnergyStats2016"&gt;{{cite web|title=Energy Statistics 2017|url=http://www.mospi.gov.in/sites/default/files/publication_reports/Energy_Statistics_2017.pdf|website=mospi.nic.in|accessdate=28 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="factual"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.livemint.com/2007/09/01001100/India-growth-story-is-attracti.html|title= India growth story is attracting talent from govt establishments|newspaper=Mint|date=1 September 2007|first=Jeetha|last=D'Silva|accessdate=11 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SCIabout"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shipindia.com/newsite/DisplayContent.asp?CategoryID=1&amp;ContentID=1|title=About Us|work=Official webpage of the Shipping Corporation of India|accessdate=3 June 2009 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071106162636/http://www.shipindia.com/newsite/DisplayContent.asp?CategoryID=1&amp;ContentID=1 |archivedate = 6 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="test"&gt;[http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2011-07-27/news/29820591_1_par-with-private-insurers-sovereign-guarantee-policies], Sovereign guarantee for all policies issued by LIC will continue.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Doris Duke''' (November 22, 1912 – October 28, 1993) was an American [[Beneficiary|heiress]], [[socialite]], [[horticulturalist]], [[art collector]], and [[Philanthropy|philanthropist]].

The daughter of a wealthy tobacco tycoon, Duke was able to fund a life of global travel and wide-ranging interests. These extended across journalism, competition surfing, jazz piano, wildlife conservation, Oriental art and [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness|Hare Krishna]].

Much of her work centered on her father's estate at [[Hillsborough Township, New Jersey]], where she created many elaborately-themed gardens, furnished with artifacts acquired on her world travels, including one of America's largest indoor botanical displays. She was also active in preserving more than 80 historic buildings in [[Newport, Rhode Island]].

Twice divorced, Duke enjoyed a colorful private life that was seldom out of the gossip columns.

Her philanthropic work in [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]] research, medicine, and child welfare continued into her old age, some of it unknown to the public during her lifetime, and her estimated $1.3 billion fortune was largely left to charity. After much legal challenging of the executors and trustees, Duke's legacy is now administered by the [http://ddcf.org Doris Duke Charitable Foundation], dedicated to medical research, prevention of cruelty to children and animals, the performing arts, wildlife and ecology.

==Early life==
Duke was born in New York City, the only child of [[tobacco]] and [[hydroelectric power]] tycoon [[James Buchanan Duke]] and his second wife, Nanaline Holt Inman, widow of Dr. William Patterson Inman.{{sfn|Valentine|1987|p=9}} At his death in 1925, the elder Duke's will bequeathed the majority of his estate to his wife and daughter,&lt;ref name=jbdukewill&gt;{{cite news |title=James B.

Duke spent her early childhood at [[Duke Farms]], her father's {{convert|2700|acre|km2|adj=on}} estate in [[Hillsborough Township, New Jersey]].&lt;ref name=suitsettled&gt;{{cite news |title=Girl of 14 to Run 3,000 Acre Estate | work = [[The New York Times]] |date=September 25, 1927 |accessdate=July 25, 2010 |page=E1 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1927/09/25/archives/girl-of-14-to-run-3000acre-estate-daughter-of-the-late-james-b-duke.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to ambiguity in James Duke's will, a lawsuit was filed to prevent auctions and outright sales of real estate he had owned; in effect, Doris Duke successfully sued her mother and other executors to prevent the sales.&lt;ref name=suitsettled/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last = Schwarz | first = Ted  | title = Trust No One: The Glamorous Life and Bizarre Death of Doris Duke  | publisher = Vivisphere Publishing  | year = 1997   | isbn = 978-1-892323-17-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the pieces of real estate in question was [[James B. Duke House|a Manhattan mansion at 1 East 78th Street]]&lt;ref name=suitsettled/&gt; which later became the home of the [[Institute of Fine Arts]] at [[New York University]].

She was presented to society as a [[debutante]] in 1930, aged 18, at a ball at [[Rough Point]], the family residence in [[Newport, Rhode Island]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Doris Duke Feted at Newport Dance | work = [[The New York Times]] |date= August 24, 1930 |accessdate=July 25, 2010 |page=N8 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1930/08/24/archives/doris-duke-feted-at-newport-dance-daughter-of-mrs-james-b-duke-is.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; She received large bequests from her father's will when she turned 21, 25, and 30; she was sometimes referred to as the "world's richest girl."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Doris Duke World's Richest Girl at Stroke of Midnight |date=November 21, 1933 |publisher=Washington Post |page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Police Guard Richest Girl |publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]] |page=4 |date=January 22, 1934}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her mother died in 1962, leaving her jewelry and a coat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=US News |work=[[Time Magazine]] |date=June 29, 1962 |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,897953,00.html |quote=All but passed over in the latest parceling was Skipper's Aunt Doris Duke—Nanaline's daughter—already worth an estimated $70 million, who was merely bequeathed some of her mother's jewelry.

==Adult life==
When Duke came of age, she used her wealth to pursue a variety of interests, including extensive world travel and the arts. During [[World War II]], she worked in a canteen for sailors in [[Egypt]], taking a [[One-dollar salary|salary of one dollar a year]].&lt;ref name=nytobit&gt;{{cite news |author=Pace, Eric |title=Doris Duke, 80, Heiress Whose Great Wealth Couldn't Buy Happiness, Is Dead |work=[[The New York Times]] | date=October 28, 1993 |accessdate=May 7, 2008 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/29/obituaries/doris-duke-80-heiress-whose-great-wealth-couldn-t-buy-happiness-is-dead.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; She spoke French fluently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Inventory of the Doris Duke Papers, 1798-2003 and undated (Duke University Libraries)|url=http://library.duke.edu/rubenstein/findingaids/uadukedoris|website=Library.duk.edu|accessdate=2016-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1945, Duke began a short-lived career as a foreign correspondent for the [[International News Service]], reporting from different cities across the war-ravaged Europe. After the war, she moved to Paris and wrote for the magazine ''[[Harper's Bazaar]]''.

While living in Hawaii, Duke became the first non-Hawaiian woman to take up competitive surfing under the tutelage of surfing champion and Olympic swimmer [[Duke Kahanamoku]] and his brothers.&lt;ref name=pony/&gt; A lover of animals, in particular her dogs and pet camels, in her later years Duke became a [[wildlife refuge]] supporter, an environmental conservationist, and a patron of historic preservation.

Duke's interest in [[horticulture]] led to a friendship with [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning author and scientific farmer [[Louis Bromfield]], who operated Malabar Farm, his country home in [[Lucas, Ohio|Lucas]], [[Ohio]] in [[Richland County, Ohio|Richland County]]. Today, his farm is part of [[Malabar Farm State Park]], made possible by a donation from Duke that helped purchase the property after Bromfield's death. A section of woods there is dedicated to her and bears her name.

At age 46, Duke started to create [[Duke Gardens (New Jersey)|Duke Gardens]], an exotic public-display garden, to honor her father James Buchanan Duke.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.njskylands.com/atdukgar.htm|title=The Gardens at Duke Farms| publisher=Skylands Visitor Guide|accessdate=June 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; She extended new [[greenhouse]]s from the [[Horace Trumbauer]] conservatory&lt;ref name="New Greenhouse"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.dukefarms.org/page.asp?pageId=282|title=New Greenhouse | publisher=Duke Farms|accessdate=May 7, 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070622073346/http://www.dukefarms.org/page.asp?pageId=282 |archivedate = June 22, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; at her home in [[Duke Farms]], New Jersey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.dukefarms.org/page.asp?pageId=4|title=History | publisher=Duke Farms|accessdate=February 11, 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080111134008/http://www.dukefarms.org/page.asp?pageId=4 |archivedate = January 11, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each of the eleven interconnected gardens was a full-scale re-creation of a garden theme, country or period, inspired by DuPont's [[Longwood Gardens]]. She designed the architectural, artistic and botanical elements of the displays based on observations from her extensive international travels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://wirednewyork.com/forum/showthread.php?t=3779|title=A Great Estate Opens Its Gates| publisher=wired|accessdate=May 10, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also labored on their installation, sometimes working 16-hour days.&lt;ref name=nytobit/&gt; Display construction began in 1958.{{sfn|Mansfield|1999|p=300}}

Duke had learned to play the piano at an early age and developed a lifelong appreciation of [[jazz]] and befriended jazz musicians. She also liked [[gospel music]] and sang in a gospel choir.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

In 1966, Duke was behind the wheel of a rented car when it lurched forward and crushed interior designer [[Eduardo Tirella]] as he was opening the gates of the mansion they were restoring in Newport, Rhode Island. While it was ruled a freak accident by the police, Tirella's family sued and won $75,000 when Duke was found negligent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McPhillips|first=Jody|last2=MacKay|first2=Scott|title=Doris Duke had it all -- and now her foundation is giving a lot back|url=http://www.projo.com/specials/century/month9/0961.htm|accessdate=March 22, 2011|newspaper=The Providence Journal|date=September 26, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Homes===
[[File:Italian Garden at Duke Gardens.jpg|thumb|Duke created the Italian Garden to showcase sculptures that her father had collected, such as this replica of Canova's Three Graces]]
Duke acquired a number of homes. Her principal residence and official domicile&lt;ref name="courttv.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.courttv.com/archive/legaldocs/newsmakers/wills/duke.html |title=court TV becomes truTV |publisher=Courttv.com |accessdate=March 22, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080914172504/http://www.courttv.com/archive/legaldocs/newsmakers/wills/duke.html |archivedate=September 14, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; was [[Duke Farms]], her father's 2,700 acre (11&amp;nbsp;km²) estate in [[Hillsborough Township, New Jersey]]. Here she created [[Duke Gardens (New Jersey)|Duke Gardens]], {{convert|60000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} public indoor botanical display that were among the largest in America.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last = Garmey  | first = Jane   | title = Doris Duke's Storied Gardens Are No More  | newspaper = Wall Street Journal  | pages =   | date = May 28, 2008   | accessdate = May 28, 2008  | url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB121192910041724297#  | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Duke's other residences were private during her lifetime: she spent summer weekends working on her [[Newport Restoration Foundation]] projects while staying at [[Rough Point]], the 49-room English manor-style mansion that she inherited in [[Newport, Rhode Island]].{{sfn|Mansfield|1999|p=364}}

Winters were spent at an estate she built in the 1930s and named "[[Shangri La (Doris Duke)|Shangri La]]" in [[Honolulu, Hawaii]];{{sfn|Mansfield|1999|p=210}} and at "[[Falcon Lair]]" in [[Beverly Hills, California]],{{sfn|Mansfield|1999|p=270}} once the home of [[Rudolph Valentino]]. She also maintained two apartments in [[Manhattan]]: a 9-room penthouse with a {{convert|1000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} veranda at 475 Park Avenue that is currently owned by journalist [[Cindy Adams]];&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last1=Swanson|first1=Carl|title=Only on Park Avenue, Kids|newspaper=New York Magazine|date=June 5, 2000|url=http://nymag.com/nymetro/realestate/features/3364}}&lt;/ref&gt; and another apartment near [[Times Square]] that she used exclusively as an office for the management of her financial affairs.

She purchased her own [[Boeing 737]] jet and redecorated the interior to travel between homes and on her trips to collect art and plants. The plane included a bedroom decorated to resemble a bedroom in a real house. Doris Duke had difficulty remaining in one place, and whenever she arrived somewhere, she had the desire to go somewhere else.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aimeedeheeren.com |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-01-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150110142857/http://www.aimeedeheeren.com/ |archivedate=January 10, 2015 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Duke was a hands-on homeowner, climbing a ladder to a three-story scaffolding to clean tile murals in the courtyard of Shangri La,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last1=Kam |first1=Nadine |title=Fantasyland |newspaper=Honolulu Star Bulletin |date=November 3, 2002 |url=http://starbulletin.com/2002/11/03/features/story1.htm |format=&amp;ndash; &lt;sup&gt;[https://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=intitle%3AFantasyland&amp;as_publication=&amp;as_ylo=2002&amp;as_yhi=2002&amp;btnG=Search Scholar search]&lt;/sup&gt; |df=mdy }}{{dead link|date=January 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; and working side by side with her gardeners at Duke Farms.

Three of Duke's residences are currently managed by subsidiaries of the [[Doris Duke Charitable Foundation]] and allow limited public access. Duke Farms in New Jersey is managed by the Duke Farms Foundation; a video tour of former Duke Gardens is available. Rough Point was deeded to the [[Newport Restoration Foundation]] in 1999 and opened to the public in 2000. Tours are limited to 12 people. Shangri-La is operated by the [[Doris Duke Foundation for Islamic Art]]; small personal tours and an online virtual tour are available.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shangrilahawaii.org/page.asp?pageId=5] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080619070048/http://www.shangrilahawaii.org/page.asp?pageId=5 |date=June 19, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
{{refimprove section|date=October 2016}}
[[File:James H. R. and Doris Cromwell.jpg|thumb|Duke with then husband [[James H. R. Cromwell]] in January 1940]]
Duke married twice, the first time in 1935 to [[James H. R. Cromwell]], the son of [[Palm Beach, Florida|Palm Beach]] society doyenne Eva Stotesbury.{{sfn|Mansfield|1999|p=132}} Cromwell, a [[New Deal]] advocate like his wife, used her fortune to finance his political career. In 1940 he served several months as U.S. Ambassador to Canada and ran unsuccessfully for the U.S. Senate. The couple had a daughter, Arden, who died one day after her birth.{{sfn|Mansfield|1999|p=257}} They divorced in 1943.{{sfn|Mansfield|1999|pages=199, 213–14}}

On September 1, 1947, while in Paris, Duke became the third wife of [[Porfirio Rubirosa]], a diplomat from the [[Dominican Republic]].{{sfn|Mansfield|1999|p=232}} She reportedly paid his second wife, actress [[Danielle Darrieux]], $1 million to agree to an uncontested divorce. Because of her great wealth, Duke's marriage to Rubirosa attracted the attention of the [[U.S. State Department]], which cautioned her against using her money to promote political agenda. Further, there was concern that in the event of her death, a foreign government could gain too much leverage. Therefore, Rubirosa had to sign a [[pre-nuptial agreement]]; during the marriage, though, she gave Rubirosa several million dollars in gifts, including a stable of polo ponies, sports cars, a converted [[B-25]] bomber, and, in the divorce settlement, a 17th-century house in Paris. One of Doris Duke's best friends was Brazilian socialite and "jetsetter" [[Aimée de Heeren]].

She reportedly had numerous affairs, with, among others, [[Duke Kahanamoku]], [[Errol Flynn]], [[Alec Cunningham-Reid]], General [[George S. Patton]], [[Joe Castro (musician)|Joe Castro]], and [[Louis Bromfield]].{{efn|Duke had numerous lovers, as documented by biographer Stephanie Mansfield; these include Duke Kahanamoku{{sfn|Mansfield|1999|p=257}} and Errol Flynn.{{sfn|Mansfield|1999|p=210}}{{sfn|Mansfield|1999|p=217}}{{sfn|Mansfield|1999|pages=229–31}}&lt;ref name=pony&gt;{{cite book|author=Pony Duke|title=Too Rich. Family Secrets of Doris Duke|publisher=HarperCollins, 1996|page=104ff|isbn=0-06-017218-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Duke posted a bail of $5,000,000 for her friend, former Philippine [[First Lady]] [[Imelda Marcos]] after the latter was arrested for racketeering.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/11/03/world/doris-duke-offers-mrs-marcos-s-bail.html|title=DORIS DUKE OFFERS MRS. MARCOS'S BAIL|last=Bohlen|first=Celestine|date=1988-11-03|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-05-08|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
In 1992, at the age of 79, Duke had a [[Rhytidectomy|facelift]]. She began trying to walk while she was still heavily medicated and fell, breaking her hip. In January 1993, she underwent surgery for a knee replacement. She was hospitalized from February 2 to April 15. She underwent a second knee surgery in July of that year.

A day after returning home from this second surgery, she suffered a severe stroke. Doris Duke [[Harry Demopoulos#Duke Estate|died]] at her Falcon's Lair home on October 28, 1993, at the age of 80. The cause was progressive [[pulmonary edema]] resulting in [[cardiac arrest]], according to a spokesman.&lt;ref name="courttv.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name=nytobit/&gt;

Duke was cremated 24 hours after her death and her executor, [[Bernard Lafferty (butler)|Bernard Lafferty]], scattered her ashes into the Pacific Ocean as her last will specified.&lt;ref name="courttv.com"/&gt;

==Net worth==
When Doris' father died, he left a fortune valued at $100 million,&lt;ref name=ny/&gt; with the largest share going to Duke and her mother. Nanaline was a shrewd businesswoman, often compared to [[Hetty Green]], and when she died in 1962, she left her daughter, then estimated to be worth $250 million, a fortune triple what J. B. had left her.&lt;ref name=ny/&gt;

Duke also owned numerous shares in big-name companies, such as [[General Motors]], and had a large financial team of bankers and accountants to manage her holdings (since, despite rumors, Duke had little to no interest in money matters). In addition, Duke had a collection of artwork, which was said to include works by Picasso, Van Gogh, Rembrandt and Monet, as well as her valuable collection of Islamic and Southeast Asia art and furniture. Also in Duke's collection were over 2,000 bottles of rare wine (worth over $5 million) and the extraordinary Duke collection of fine jewels. Her total net worth, including all property, was valued at $5.3 billion.

===Philanthropy===
Duke’s first major philanthropic act was to establish Independent Aid, Inc., in 1934, when she was 21 years old, in order to manage the many requests for financial assistance addressed to her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Doris Duke Biographical History and Archival Collections (Duke University Libraries)| url=http://library.duke.edu/rubenstein/collections/people/dorisduke/#item-14|website=Library.duk.edu|accessdate=2016-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1958, she established the [[Duke Gardens (New Jersey)|Duke Gardens]] Foundation to endow the public display gardens she started to create at Duke Farms. Her Foundation intended that Duke Gardens "reveal the interests and philanthropic aspirations of the Duke family, as well as an appreciation for other cultures and a yearning for global understanding.".&lt;ref name="New Greenhouse"/&gt; Duke Gardens were the center of a controversy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.savedukegardens.org |title=Duke Gardens, Then and Now |publisher=www.SaveDukeGardens.org |accessdate=March 22, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080820103927/http://savedukegardens.org/ |archive-date=August 20, 2008 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; over the decision by the trustees of the [[Doris Duke Charitable Foundation]] to close them on May 25, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Duke Farms Promotes "Greener" Future |publisher=Duke Farms |date=March 2, 2008 |url=http://www.dukefarms.org/page.asp?pageId=523 |language= |accessdate=April 14, 2008 |quote=it’s the final months of the gardens being on display in the greenhouses that have enchanted visitors since 1964 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080328065214/http://www.dukefarms.org/page.asp?pageId=523 |archivedate=March 28, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1968, Duke created the [[Newport Restoration Foundation]] with the goal of [[historic preservation|preserving]] more than eighty colonial buildings in the town. Historic properties include [[Rough Point]], [[Samuel Whitehorne House]], [[Prescott Farm]], the Buloid-Perry House, the King's Arms Tavern, the Baptist Meetinghouse, and the  Cotton House. Seventy-one buildings are rented to tenants. Only five function as museums. She also funded the construction of [[Maharishi Mahesh Yogi]]'s ashram in India, [[The Beatles at Rishikesh|visited by the Beatles]] in 1968.&lt;ref name=NCH&gt;{{cite book|title=Beyond Gurus: A Woman of Many Worlds|first=Nancy Cooke|last= de Herrera|publisher=Blue Dolphin Publishing|year=1993|isbn=978-0-931892-49-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
  
Duke's extensive travels led to an interest in a variety of cultures, and during her lifetime she amassed a considerable collection of Islamic and Southeast Asian art. After her death, numerous pieces were donated to The [[Asian Art Museum of San Francisco|Asian Art Museum]] of San Francisco and the [[Walters Art Museum]] of Baltimore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tingley|first=Nancy|title=Doris Duke: The Southeast Asian Art Collection|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|pages=93–94|isbn=978-0-8248-2773-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Duke did much additional philanthropic work and was a major benefactor of medical research and child welfare programs. In the late 1980s, Duke donated $2 million to Duke University to be used for [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]] research.&lt;ref name=ny/&gt; Her foundation, Independent Aid, became the Doris Duke Foundation, which still exists as a private grant-making entity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Inventory of the Doris Duke Foundation Records, 1934-2009 (Duke University Libraries)|accessdate=October 23, 2016|url=http://library.duke.edu/rubenstein/findingaids/dorisdukefound|website=Library.duk.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; After her death, the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation was established in 1996, supporting four national grant making programs and Doris Duke's three estates, [[Shangri La (Doris Duke)|Shangri La]], [[Rough Point]], and [[Duke Farms]].

===Trusts and wills===
Duke was the life beneficiary of two trusts created by her father, James Buchanan Duke, in 1917 and 1924. The income from the trusts was payable to any children after her death. In 1988, at the age of 75, Duke legally adopted a woman named Chandi Heffner, then a 35-year-old [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness|Hare Krishna]] devotee and sister of the third wife of billionaire [[Nelson Peltz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,164455,00.html |title=Sarandon to Play World's Richest Little Girl |publisher=[[Fox News]] |date=2005-08-02 |accessdate=2016-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Duke initially maintained that Heffner was the reincarnation of her only biological child Arden, who died soon after birth in 1940.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.legalzoom.com/legal-articles/article15046.html|title=Top Three Inheritance Disputes|publisher=legalzoom|accessdate=May 10, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two women had a falling out, and the final version of Duke's will specified that she did not wish Heffner to benefit from her father's trusts; she also negated the adoption. Despite the negation, after Duke's death, the estate's trustees settled a lawsuit brought by Heffner for $65 million.&lt;ref name="Top Three Inheritance Disputes"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.legalzoom.com/legal-articles/article15046.html|title=Top Three Inheritance Disputes|publisher=legalzoom|accessdate=June 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In her final will, Duke left virtually all of her fortune to several existing and new charitable foundations. She appointed her butler, [[Bernard Lafferty]] born in [[Creeslough]], [[County Donegal]], [[Ireland]], as executor of her estate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1996-11-05/news/mn-61438_1_butler-made-wealthy-by-heiress|work=Los Angeles Times|title=Butler Made Wealthy by Heiress Dies|date=November 5, 1996|author=Lieberman, Paul|accessdate=September 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lafferty appointed the US Trust company as corporate co-executor. Lafferty and Duke's friend Marion Oates Charles were named as her trustees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dukeminier|first=Jesse|title=Wills, Trusts, and Estates|publisher = Aspen Publishers|pages=93–94}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However a number of lawsuits were filed against the will. At death, Duke's fortune was estimated at upwards of $1.2 billion.&lt;ref name=ny/&gt; The best-known lawsuit&lt;ref name="nytimes1996"&gt;{{cite news|last=Van Natta|first=Dan|title=Deal Reached over the Estate of Doris Duke|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=April 11, 1996|accessdate=May 7, 2008|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F02E5D91039F932A25757C0A960958260}}&lt;/ref&gt; was initiated by [[Harry Demopoulos]]. In an earlier will, Demopoulos had been named executor &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/11/05/nyregion/bernard-lafferty-the-butler-for-doris-duke-dies-at-51.html|title=Bernard Lafferty the Butler for Doris Dukes Dies at 51|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=2016-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; and challenged Lafferty's appointment. Demopolous argued that Lafferty and his lawyers had cajoled a sick, sedated old woman into giving him control of her estate.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

Even more sensational accusations were made by a nurse, Tammy Payette, who contended that Lafferty and a prominent Beverly Hills physician, Dr. Charles Kivowitz, had conspired to hasten Duke's death with morphine and Demerol.  In 1996, the year Lafferty died, the Los Angeles [[District Attorney]]'s office ruled there was no firm evidence of foul play.&lt;ref name="Top Three Inheritance Disputes"/&gt;

[[Duke University]] also filed suit, claiming entitlement to a larger share of the Duke assets than the $10 million provided in the will (although Duke's will also stated that any beneficiary who disputed its provisions should receive nothing&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.courttv.com/archive/legaldocs/newsmakers/wills/duke.html|title=Last Will of Duke, Section 19|publisher=Court TV|accessdate=September 10, 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080914172504/http://www.courttv.com/archive/legaldocs/newsmakers/wills/duke.html|archivedate=September 14, 2008|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

Litigation involving 40 lawyers at 10 different law firms tied up the Duke estate for nearly three years. New York courts ultimately removed Lafferty for using estate funds for his own support and US Trust for failing "to do anything to stop him."&lt;ref name="Top Three Inheritance Disputes"/&gt; The [[Surrogate Court]] of Manhattan overrode Duke's will and appointed new trustees from among those who had challenged it: [[Harry Demopoulos]]; J. Carter Brown (later also involved in overturning the will of [[Albert C. Barnes]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.barneswatch.org/menu_matisse.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-09-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090116035542/http://www.barneswatch.org/menu_matisse.html |archivedate=January 16, 2009 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;); Marion Oates Charles, the sole trustee from Duke's last will; James Gill, a lawyer; [[Nannerl O. Keohane]], president of Duke University; and [[John J. Mack]], president of [[Morgan Stanley]].&lt;ref name="nytimes1996"/&gt; The fees for their lawsuits exceeded $10 million, and were paid by the Duke estate. These trustees now control all assets of the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation, which Doris Duke directed should support medical research, anti-vivisectionism, prevention of cruelty to children and animals, performance arts, wildlife, and ecology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.courttv.com/archive/legaldocs/newsmakers/wills/duke.html|title=Last Will of Doris Duke, Section 8|publisher=Court TV|accessdate=September 10, 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080914172504/http://www.courttv.com/archive/legaldocs/newsmakers/wills/duke.html|archivedate=September 14, 2008|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The DDCF also controls funding for the three separate foundations created to operate Duke's former homes: the Doris Duke Foundation for Islamic Art, Duke Farms and Newport Restoration Foundation. The trustees have progressively reduced funding for these foundations, stating that Doris Duke's own works are "perpetuating the Duke family history of personal passions and conspicuous consumption."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Sudol |first=Valerie |title=Famed Duke Gardens To Become Ambitious 'Green' Lab |newspaper=Newhouse News Service |year=2008 |accessdate=May 6, 2008 |url=http://www.newhouse.com/famed-duke-gardens-to-become-ambitious-green-laboratory-4.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080928021113/http://www.newhouse.com/famed-duke-gardens-to-become-ambitious-green-laboratory-4.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=September 28, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, these foundations have sold some assets&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newportrestoration.com/pr/CarpetSale08.html|title=Sale of Rare Carpet to Benefit Newport Restoration Foundation Collections Fund|publisher=Newport Restoration Foundation|accessdate=June 4, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080921162758/http://www.newportrestoration.com/pr/CarpetSale08.html|archive-date=September 21, 2008|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and have closed Duke Gardens. Christie's, New York, published a heavily illustrated catalog of over 600 pages for its auction of "The Doris Duke Collection, sold to benefit the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation" which was held in New York City over three days in 2004.

==In popular culture==

* Her life is also the subject of the [[HBO]] film ''[[Bernard and Doris]]'', starring [[Susan Sarandon]] as Duke and [[Ralph Fiennes]] as the butler Lafferty ([[2007 in film|2007]])

== Biography ==
Erel Margalit was born in kibbutz [[Na'an]], the eldest of three siblings. His father, Itzik Margalit, was an officer in the IDF [[Armored Corps (Israel)|Armored Corps]] and one of the founders of moshav [[Kfar Haim]], and his mother, Mickey, was a founding member of moshav [[Avihayil]]. On his mother's side, he is descended from Jews who immigrated to what was then Ottoman Palestine from [[Bulgaria]] in the 19th century, prior to the beginning of the [[First Aliyah]]. He is a descendant of Shmuel Tagir, one of the founders of [[Tel Aviv]]. 

In 1969, when Margalit was eight years old, the family was sent on a mission to [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]] where his father was head of a local Hebrew school.&lt;ref name="Meet the MK:Erel Margalit"/&gt; While in high school in Michigan, Erel became a point-guard on a local basketball team. After returning to Israel in 1971, the family settled in [[Karmiel]] before moving to [[Jerusalem]]. He attended Rene Cassin High School and continued to play basketball there. Recognition of his talent led to an offer to join the Israeli youth team, but he declined in favor of serving in an [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]] combat unit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Prince-Gibson|first=Eetta|title=Erel Margalit's powerful visions|url=http://www.israel21c.org/culture/erel-margalit-s-powerful-visions|accessdate=May 2, 2011|newspaper=Israel21C|date=May 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He served in the [[Golani Brigade]]'s ''"Orev"'' unit as an operations officer, reaching the rank of sergeant major. As a reservist in 1982, he fought in the [[1982 Lebanon War|First Lebanon War]] with the IDF's airborne anti-tank division.

Margalit studied philosophy and English literature at the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]], where he met his future wife. In 1985 Margalit moved to New York to attend [[Columbia University]] where he continued towards a doctorate in philosophy and logic. During his studies he was exposed to [[Michael Porter]]'s "The Competitive Advantage of Nations," which influenced his doctoral dissertation on the subject, "The Entrepreneur as a Leader in the Historical Process."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Israeli Business Forum of New York|url=http://www.israelibusinessforum.org/content/events/past_events/04-08-17erel_margalit.html|work=Speaker: Erel N. Margalit&amp;nbsp;— Founder &amp; Managing Partner, Jerusalem Venture Partners (JVP)|accessdate=May 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; which he completed in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://engineering.columbia.edu/web/newsletterarchive/spring08/feature2.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-11-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100623054811/http://engineering.columbia.edu/web/newsletterarchive/spring08/feature2.php |archivedate=2010-06-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the [[First Intifada]] and the anti-Israel activities on American campuses, Margalit organized a dialogue group between Israeli and Arab students. Together with other Israeli doctoral students, among them [[Yossi Dahan]] and [[Yossi Bachar]], he established groups on eight leading campuses.

Margalit is married to Debbie and has three daughters: Tair, Eden, and Maya.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Israeli Business Forum|url=http://www.israelibusinessforum.org/content/events/past_events/10-03-23-Margalit.html|work=PIONEERING ISRAEL'S NEW SOCIAL-ECONOMIC ERA:The Role of the Creative Class|accessdate=May 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==

=== Jerusalem Development Authority ===
Returning to Israel in 1990, Margalit began to work at the [[Jerusalem Development Authority]] under Uzi Wexler, promoting business development and technological entrepreneurship in Jerusalem. During this time, he worked closely with [[Teddy Kollek]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Giving Wisely|url=http://www.givingwisely.org.il/?page_id=3446&amp;amuta=580394872|work=Jerusalem Venture Partners (JVP) Community}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also worked in cooperation with American governors, among them [[Mario Cuomo]] of [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Pete Wilson]] of [[California]], [[James Florio]] of [[New Jersey]] and [[Rodney Wallace (Massachusetts)|Rodney Wallace]] of Massachusetts.

In three years, he succeeded in bringing in 70 large technology companies, including [[Digital data|Digital]] and [[IBM]]. In June 1994,  Margalit left the JDA and embarked on an independent career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Prince-Gibson|first=Eetta|title=Erel Margalit's powerful visions|url=http://www.israel21c.org/culture/erel-margalit-s-powerful-visions|accessdate=May 2, 2011|newspaper=Israel21C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Social entrepreneurship ==

=== In the Community ''(Bakehila)'' ===
In 2002, Marglit founded the social organization '''Bakehila''' ('''בקהילה''' "In the Community" in Hebrew) as a means of reducing the socio-economic gap affecting disadvantaged children in Jerusalem. Bakehila runs [http://bakehila.wix.com/english#!programs/ci93 '''educational programs'''] in lower socioeconomic neighborhoods of Jerusalem with the goal of raising the students' academic achievements, and promoting the children's personal and interpersonal growth. Thousands of students from Jerusalem have attended the program during its first eight years.&lt;ref name="about"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=JVP Venture Capital|url=http://www.jvpvc.com/community-about|title=About|accessdate=May 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, ''Bakehila'' opened an educational enrichment center in the Arab neighborhood of [[Beit Safafa]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-201573198.html Beit Safafa education center dedicated]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Lab ''(Hama'abada)'' ===
Following the events of the [[Second Intifada]] and the massive departure of young artists from Jerusalem, Erel Margalit created The Lab ''(Hama'abada)'' to keep and attract young artists in Israel's capital. The Lab provides support and assistance to these artists, providing venues for young Israelis to create, perform, and receive feedback on their work.&lt;ref name="about" /&gt;

== Political activism ==

=== 2005 elections ===
During the 2005 election campaign, Margalit was one of the first businessmen to support [[Amir Peretz]] in the general elections. He joined the Labor Party and expressed his support of Peretz's social agenda. Margalit promoted his vision of economic growth whereby the [[Haredi Judaism#Israel|ultra-Orthodox]] and [[Arab citizens of Israel|Arab]] populations would be integrated in the labor market in Israel, thus taking them out of poverty and alleviating pressure on the middle classes. In addition, Margalit presented a plan for bringing the communities of Israel's geographic periphery closer to the center of the country, both economically and socially.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Andromidas|first=Dean|title=Lebanon Wire|url=http://www.lebanonwire.com/1105/05113001EIB.asp|work=Political Upset in Israel: Labor Leader To Follow Rabin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Avoda Now Movement ===
Since his initial support of the Labor Party, Margalit grew disillusioned with the direction of the party and its leadership. On January 17, 2011, the Chairman of the Labor Party, [[Ehud Barak]], announced his resignation from the Labor Party and the establishment of a new party&amp;nbsp;– "[[Atzmaut]]" (Independence Party).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://nypost.com/2011/01/18/barak-dumps-labor/ |title=Barak dumps Labor|author=Post Staff Report|work=[[New York Post]] |date=January 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two days after this announcement Margalit helped to found the "Avoda Now" movement together with prominent members of Israel's business, technology, and cultural community, calling for a revival of the Labor Party. The movement launched a public campaign calling the people to join the Labor party lines; with the aim of renewing its institutions, restoring its social values, and choosing a new, dynamic leadership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PR Newswire|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/04/27/idUS272092+27-Apr-2011+PRN20110427|work=Erel Margalit Announces His Candidacy to Lead the Labor Party|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=May 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 27, 2011, saying he could "no longer watch from the sidelines as the political situation in Israel deteriorates", Margalit announced his intention to run for the chairmanship of Israel's Labor Party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/04/27/idUS272092+27-Apr-2011+PRN20110427|title=Erel Margalit Announces His Candidacy to Lead the Labor Party|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=May 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In the Knesset ===

'''Expert-as-a-Service''' (ExaaS) is an online delivery model of human [[consulting]] and/or automated [[knowledge transfer]]. Similarly to SaaS ([[Software as a service]]) the concept of ExaaS comes from the remote nature of processing data and/or providing service.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7149">In [[data warehousing]], a '''fact table''' consists of the measurements, metrics or [[Fact (data warehouse)|facts]] of a [[business process]]. It is located at the center of a [[star schema]] or a [[snowflake schema]] surrounded by [[dimension table]]s. Where multiple fact tables are used, these are arranged as a [[fact constellation schema]]. A fact table typically has two types of columns: those that contain facts and those that are a [[foreign key]] to dimension tables. The primary key of a fact table is usually a composite key that is made up of all of its foreign keys. Fact tables contain the content of the data warehouse and store different types of measures like additive, non additive, and semi additive measures.

Fact tables provide the (usually) additive values that act as independent variables by which dimensional attributes are analyzed. Fact tables are often defined by their ''grain''. The grain of a fact table represents the most atomic level by which the facts may be defined. The grain of a sales fact table might be stated as "sales volume by day by product by store". Each record in this fact table is therefore uniquely defined by a day, product and store. Other dimensions might be members of this fact table (such as location/region) but these add nothing to the uniqueness of the fact records. These "affiliate dimensions" allow for additional slices of the independent facts but generally provide insights at a higher level of aggregation (a region contains many stores).

==Example==
If the [[business process]] is sales, then the corresponding fact table will typically contain columns representing both [[raw fact]]s and [[aggregate (data warehouse)|aggregations]] in rows such as:
* ''$12,000'', being "sales for New York store for 15-Jan-2005".
* ''$34,000'', being "sales for Los Angeles store for 15-Jan-2005"
* ''$22,000'', being "sales for New York store for 16-Jan-2005"
* ''$21,000'', being "average daily sales for Los Angeles Store for Jan-2005"
* ''$65,000'', being "average daily sales for Los Angeles Store for Feb-2005"
* ''$33,000'', being "average daily sales for Los Angeles Store for year 2005"
''"Average daily sales"'' is a measurement that is stored in the fact table. The fact table also contains [[foreign key]]s from the [[dimension table]]s, where [[time series]] (e.g. dates) and other [[dimension (data warehouse)|dimensions]] (e.g. store location, salesperson, product) are stored.

All [[foreign key]]s between fact and dimension tables should be [[surrogate key]]s, not reused keys from operational data.

==Measure types==
* Additive - measures that can be added across any dimension.
* Non-additive - measures that cannot be added across any dimension.
* Semi-additive - measures that can be added across some dimensions.

A fact table might contain either detail level facts or facts that have been aggregated (fact tables that contain aggregated facts are often instead called summary tables).

Special care must be taken when handling ratios and percentage. One good design rule&lt;ref name="Kimball DWT"&gt;Kimball &amp; Ross - The Data Warehouse Toolkit, 2nd Ed [Wiley 2002]&lt;/ref&gt; is to never store percentages or ratios in fact tables but only calculate these in the data access tool. Thus only store the numerator and denominator in the fact table, which then can be aggregated and the aggregated stored values can then be used for calculating the ratio or percentage in the data access tool.

In the real world, it is possible to have a fact table that contains no measures or facts. These tables are called "factless fact tables", or "[[junction table]]s".

The ''factless fact tables'' can for example be used for modellings many-to-many relationships or capture events.&lt;ref name="Kimball DWT"/&gt;

==Types of fact tables==
There are four fundamental measurement events, which characterize all fact tables.&lt;ref name="Kimball"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
; Transactional
:A transactional table is the most basic and fundamental. The grain associated with a transactional fact table is usually specified as "one row per line in a transaction", e.g., every line on a receipt. Typically a transactional fact table holds data of the most detailed level, causing it to have a great number of [[Dimension (data warehouse)|dimensions]] associated with it.
; Periodic snapshots
:The periodic snapshot, as the name implies, takes a "picture of the moment", where the moment could be any defined period of time, e.g. a performance summary of a salesman over the previous month. A periodic snapshot table is dependent on the transactional table, as it needs the detailed data held in the transactional fact table in order to deliver the chosen performance output.
; Accumulating snapshots
:This type of fact table is used to show the activity of a process that has a well-defined beginning and end, e.g., the processing of an order. An order moves through specific steps until it is fully processed. As steps towards fulfilling the order are completed, the associated row in the fact table is updated. An accumulating snapshot table often has multiple date columns, each representing a milestone in the process. Therefore, it's important to have an entry in the associated date dimension that represents an unknown date, as many of the milestone dates are unknown at the time of the creation of the row.
; Temporal snapshots
:By applying [[temporal database]] theory and modeling techniques the ''temporal snapshot fact table'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Davide|first=Mauri|title=Temporal Snapshot Fact Table|url=http://www.slideshare.net/davidemauri/temporal-snapshot-fact-tables}}&lt;/ref&gt; allows to have the equivalent of daily snapshots without really having daily snapshots. It introduces the concept of time Intervals into a fact table, allowing to save a lot of space, optimizing performances while allowing the end user to have the logical equivalent of the "picture of the moment" they are interested in.

==Steps in designing a fact table==
* Identify a business process for analysis (like sales).
* Identify measures of facts (sales dollar), by asking questions like 'what number of X are relevant for the business process?', replacing the X with various options that make sense within the context of the business.
* Identify dimensions for facts (product dimension, location dimension, time dimension, organization dimension), by asking questions that make sense within the context of the business, like 'analyse by X', where X is replaced with the subject to test.
* List the columns that describe each dimension (region name, branch name, business unit name).
* Determine the lowest level (granularity) of summary in a fact table (e.g. sales dollars).

An alternative approach is the four step design process described in Kimball:&lt;ref name="Kimball DWT"/&gt; select the business process, declare the grain, identify the dimensions, identify the facts.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3390">The '''Federation of British Industries''' ('''FBI''') was an [[employers' association]] in the United Kingdom.

Founded by the Midlands industrialist [[Dudley Docker]] in 1916 as the '''United British Industries' Association''', but renamed later that same year, it was initially composed of 124 firms which each gave £1,000 for its foundation. The FBI never took part in labour relations but was progressively involved in [[tariff reform]]. It slowly gathered other regional and overseas organisations and was incorporated by [[Royal Charter]] in 1923.

In 1965, it merged with the [[British Employers' Confederation]] and the [[National Association of British Manufacturers]] to form the [[Confederation of British Industry]]. It was by far the biggest organisation of the three, composed of about 9,000 individual firms and 272 trade associations by 1964.

Presidents included [[Vincent Caillard|Sir Vincent Caillard]] (1919), [[Sir Peter Rylands, 1st Baronet|Sir Peter Rylands]] (1919–1921), [[Oliver Carleton Armstrong]] (1921–1922), [[Eric Geddes|Sir Eric Geddes]] (1923–1925), [[Max Muspratt|Sir Max Muspratt]] (1926–1927), [[Jack Pease, 1st Baron Gainford|Lord Gainford]] (1927–1928), [[Rowland Blades, 1st Baron Ebbisham|Lord Ebbisham]] (1928–1929),  [[Lennox B.

{{Redirect|Free enterprise}}
{{Capitalism}}
In [[economics]], a '''free market''' is an [[idealized cognitive model| idealized]] [[market (economics) |system]] in which the prices for goods and services are determined by the [[open market]] and by [[consumer]]s. In a free market the laws and forces of [[supply and demand]] are free from any intervention by a [[Forms of government| government]], by a price-setting monopoly, or by other authority. Proponents of the concept of free market contrast it with a [[regulated market]], in which a government intervenes in supply and demand through various methods — such as [[tariff]]s — used to restrict trade and to protect the local economy. In an idealized [[free-market economy]], prices for goods and services are set freely by the forces of supply and demand and are allowed to reach their point of [[Economic equilibrium|equilibrium]] without intervention by government policy.

Scholars contrast the concept of a free market with the concept of a [[Coordinated market economy| coordinated market]] in fields of study such as [[political economy]], [[new institutional economics]], [[economic sociology]], and [[political science]]. All of these fields emphasize the importance in actually existing market systems of rule-making institutions external to the simple forces of supply and demand which create space for those forces to operate to control productive output and distribution.

Although free markets are commonly associated with [[capitalism]] within a [[market economy]] in contemporary usage and [[popular culture]], free markets have also been advocated by [[free-market anarchism| free-market anarchists]], [[market socialism |market socialists]], and some proponents of [[cooperative]]s and advocates of [[profit sharing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last= Bockman |first= Johanna |title= Markets in the name of Socialism: The Left-Wing origins of Neoliberalism |publisher= Stanford University Press |year= 2011 |month= |isbn= 978-0-8047-7566-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Criticism of the theoretical concept may regard systems with significant [[market power]], [[inequality of bargaining power]], or [[information asymmetry]] as less than free, with regulation being necessary to control those imbalances in order to allow markets to function more efficiently as well as produce more desirable social outcomes.

==Economic systems==

===Laissez-faire economics===
{{Libertarianism sidebar}}
{{Liberalism sidebar}}
{{Main|Laissez-faire}}
The laissez-faire principle expresses a preference for an absence of non-market pressures on prices and wages, such as those from discriminatory government taxes, subsidies, [[tariff]]s, regulations of purely private behavior, or [[government-granted monopoly|government-granted]] or [[coercive monopoly|coercive monopolies]]. [[Friedrich Hayek]] argued in ''The Pure Theory of Capital'' that the goal is the preservation of the unique information contained in the price itself.&lt;ref name="hayek_pure"&gt;''The Pure Theory of Capital'', F.A. Hayek, 1941&lt;/ref&gt;

The definition of ''free market'' has been disputed and made complex by collectivist political philosophers and socialist economic ideas.&lt;ref name="Popper 1994"&gt;{{cite book |last= Popper| first= Karl |title=The Open Society and Its Enemies| publisher= Routledge Classics|year=1994 |isbn= 978-0-415-61021-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; This contention arose from the divergence from [[Classical economics|classical economists]] such as [[Richard Cantillon]], [[Adam Smith]], [[David Ricardo]], and [[Thomas Robert Malthus]], and from the continental [[Economics|economic science]] developed primarily by the Spanish scholastic and French classical economists, including [[Anne-Robert-Jacques Turgot, Baron de Laune]], [[Jean-Baptiste Say]] and [[Frédéric Bastiat]].

During the [[Marginal utility#The Marginal Revolution|marginal revolution]], subjective value theory was rediscovered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Popper| first= Karl |title=The Poverty of Historicism| publisher= Routledge Classics|year=2002 |isbn= 0415278465}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Socialist economics===
{{Socialism sidebar}}

Various forms of [[socialism]] based on free markets have existed since the 19th century. Early notable socialist proponents of free markets include [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], [[Benjamin Tucker]], and the [[Ricardian socialist]]s. These economists believed that genuinely free markets and [[voluntary exchange]] could not exist within the [[Exploitation (Marxism)|exploitative]] conditions of [[capitalism]].

These proposals ranged from various forms of [[worker cooperative]]s operating in a free market economy, such as the [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualist]] system proposed by Proudhon, to state-owned enterprises operating in unregulated and open markets. These models of socialism are not to be confused with other forms of market socialism (e.g. the [[Lange model]]) where publicly owned enterprises are coordinated by various degrees of [[economic planning]], or where capital good prices are determined through marginal cost pricing.

Advocates of free-market socialism such as [[Jaroslav Vanek]] argue that genuinely free markets are not possible under conditions of private ownership of productive property. Instead, he contends that the class differences and inequalities in income and power that result from private ownership enable the interests of the dominant class to skew the market to their favor, either in the form of monopoly and market power, or by utilizing their wealth and resources to legislate government policies that benefit their specific business interests.&lt;ref&gt;"Cooperative Economics: An Interview with Jaroslav Vanek", interview by Albert Perkins. Retrieved March 17, 2011: http://www.ru.org/51cooper.html&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Vanek states that workers in a socialist economy based on cooperative and self-managed enterprises have stronger incentives to maximize productivity because they would receive a share of the profits (based on the overall performance of their enterprise) in addition to receiving their fixed wage or salary.

Socialists also assert that free market capitalism leads to an excessively skewed distribution of income, which in turn leads to social instability. As a result, corrective measures in the form of [[social welfare]], re-distributive taxation, and administrative costs are required, which end up being paid into workers hands who spend and help the economy to run. They claim corporate monopolies run rampant in free markets, with endless agency over the consumer. Thus, free market socialism desires government regulation of markets to prevent social instability, although at the cost of taxpayer dollars.&lt;ref name="The Political Economy of Socialism 1982. pp. 197–198"&gt;''The Political Economy of Socialism'', by Horvat, Branko. 1982. (pp. 197–98)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Geoist economics===
As explained above, for classical economists such as [[Adam Smith]] the term "free market" does not necessarily refer to a market free from government interference, but rather free from all forms of economic privilege, monopolies, and artificial scarcities.&lt;ref name="Popper 1994"/&gt; This implies that [[economic rent]]s, i.e. profits generated from a lack of [[perfect competition]], must be reduced or eliminated as much as possible through free competition.

Economic theory suggests the returns to [[land]] and other [[natural resource]]s are economic rents that cannot be reduced in such a way because of their perfect inelastic supply.&lt;ref&gt;[[Adam Smith]], [[The Wealth of Nations]] [[s:The Wealth of Nations/Book V/Chapter 2|Book V, Chapter 2]], Part 2, Article I: Taxes upon the Rent of Houses&lt;/ref&gt; Some economic thinkers emphasize the need to share those rents as an essential requirement for a well functioning market. It is suggested this would both eliminate the need for regular taxes that have a negative effect on trade (see [[deadweight loss]]) as well as release land and resources that are speculated upon or monopolised. Two features that improve the competition and free market mechanisms. [[Winston Churchill]] supported this view by his statement "Land is the mother of all monopoly".&lt;ref&gt;House Of Commons May 4th; King's Theatre, Edinburgh, July 17&lt;/ref&gt;

The American economist and social philosopher [[Henry George]], the most famous proponent of this thesis, wanted to accomplish this through a high [[land value tax]] that replaces all other taxes.&lt;ref&gt;Backhaus, "Henry George's Ingenious Tax," pp. 453–58.&lt;/ref&gt; Followers of his ideas are often called [[Georgism|Georgists]] or Geoists and [[Geolibertarianism|Geolibertarians]].

[[Léon Walras]], one of the founders of the [[neoclassical economics]] who helped formulate the [[general equilibrium theory]], had a very similar view. He argued that free competition could only be realized under conditions of state ownership of natural resources and land. Additionally, income taxes could be eliminated because the state would receive income to finance public services through owning such resources and enterprises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Bockman|first= Johanna |title= Markets in the name of Socialism: The Left-Wing origins of Neoliberalism|publisher= Stanford University Press|year= 2011|month= |isbn= 978-0-8047-7566-3|page = 21|quote= For Walras, socialism would provide the necessary institutions for free competition and social justice. Socialism, in Walras's view, entailed state ownership of land and natural resources and the abolition of income taxes. As owner of land and natural resources, the state could then lease these resources to many individuals and groups, which would eliminate monopolies and thus enable free competition. The leasing of land and natural resources would also provide enough state revenue to make income taxes unnecessary, allowing a worker to invest his savings and become 'an owner or capitalist at the same time that he remains a worker.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-laissez-faire capitalist systems===
The stronger incentives to maximize productivity that Vanek conceives as possible in a socialist economy based on cooperative and self-managed enterprises might be accomplished in a capitalistic free market if [[employee stock ownership plan|employee-owned companies]] were the norm, as envisioned by various thinkers including [[Louis O. Kelso]] and [[James S. Albus]].

==Concepts==

===Perfect competition and market failure===

Conditions that must exist for unregulated markets to behave as "free markets" are summarized at [[perfect competition]].  An absence of any of these perfect competition ideal conditions is a "[[market failure]]."  Most schools of economics allow that regulatory intervention may provide a substitute force to counter a market failure.  Under this thinking, this form of market regulation may be better than an unregulated market at providing a "free market."

===Supply and demand===
{{Main|Supply and demand}}
Demand for an item (such as goods or services) refers to the market pressure from people trying to buy it. Buyers have a maximum price they are willing to pay and sellers have a minimum price they are willing to offer their product. The point at which the supply and demand curves meet is the equilibrium price of the good and quantity demanded. Sellers willing to offer their goods at a lower price than the equilibrium price receive the difference as [[economic surplus|producer surplus]]. Buyers willing to pay for goods at a higher price than the equilibrium price receive the difference as [[economic surplus|consumer surplus]].&lt;ref name="Judd1997"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0165-1889(97)00010-9| title = Computational economics and economic theory: Substitutes or complements?| journal = [[Journal of Economic Dynamics and Control]]| volume = 21| issue = 6| pages = 907–42| year = 1997| last1 = Judd | first1 = K. L.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The model is commonly applied to wages in the market for labor. The typical roles of supplier and consumer are reversed. The suppliers are individuals, who try to sell (supply) their labor for the highest price. The consumers are businesses, which try to buy (demand) the type of labor they need at the lowest price. As more people offer their labor in that market, the equilibrium wage decreases and the equilibrium level of employment increases as the supply curve shifts to the right. The opposite happens if fewer people offer their wages in the market as the supply curve shifts to the left.&lt;ref name="Judd1997" /&gt;

In a free market, individuals and firms taking part in these transactions have the liberty to enter, leave and participate in the market as they so choose. Prices and quantities are allowed to adjust according to economic conditions in order to reach equilibrium and properly allocate resources. However, in many countries around the world, governments seek to intervene in the free market in order to achieve certain social or political agendas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wps.pearsoned.co.uk/ema_uk_he_sloman_econbus_3/18/4748/1215583.cw/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-06-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140522012501/http://wps.pearsoned.co.uk/ema_uk_he_sloman_econbus_3/18/4748/1215583.cw/ |archivedate=2014-05-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Governments may attempt to create [[social equality]] or [[equality of outcome]] by intervening in the market through actions such as imposing a [[minimum wage]] (price floor) or erecting [[price controls]] (price ceiling). Other lesser-known goals are also pursued, such as in the United States, where the federal government subsidizes owners of fertile land to not grow crops in order to prevent the supply curve from further shifting to the right and decreasing the equilibrium price. This is done under the justification of maintaining farmers' profits; due to the relative [[elasticity (economics)|inelasticity]] of demand for crops, increased supply would lower the price but not significantly increase quantity demanded, thus placing pressure on farmers to exit the market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Farm Program Pays $1.3 Billion to People Who Don't Farm |newspaper=[[Washington Post]] |date=2 July 2006 |accessdate=3 June 2014 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/07/01/AR2006070100962.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Such interventions are often done in the name of maintaining basic assumptions of free markets, such as the idea that the costs of production must be included in the price of goods.  Pollution and depletion costs are sometimes NOT included in the cost of production (a manufacturer that withdraws water at one location then discharges it polluted downstream, avoiding the cost of treating the water), so governments may opt to impose regulations in an attempt to try to internalize all of the cost of production (and ultimately include them in the price of the goods).

Advocates of the free market contend that government intervention hampers economic growth by disrupting the natural allocation of resources according to supply and demand, while critics of the free market contend that government intervention is sometimes necessary to protect a country's economy from better-developed and more influential economies, while providing the stability necessary for wise long-term investment.
[[Milton Friedman]] pointed to failures of [[central planning]], [[price controls]] and [[government-owned corporation|state-owned corporations]], particularly in the [[Economy of the Soviet Union|Soviet Union]] and [[People's Republic of China#Economy|Communist China]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.columbia.edu/~esp2/WSJ%20Whitehouse%20Article.pdf Ip, Greg and Mark Whitehouse, "How Milton Friedman Changed Economics, Policy and Markets", ''Wall Street Journal Online'' (November 17, 2006).]&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Ha-Joon Chang]] cites the examples of post-war Japan and the growth of South Korea's steel industry.&lt;ref&gt;"[[Bad Samaritans: The Myth of Free Trade and the Secret History of Capitalism]]", Ha-Joon Chang, Bloomsbury Press, {{ISBN|978-1596915985}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economic equilibrium===
{{Main|Economic equilibrium}}
[[General equilibrium theory]] has demonstrated, with varying degrees of mathematical rigor over time, that under certain conditions of [[Perfect Competition|competition]], the law of [[supply and demand]] predominates in this ideal free and competitive market, influencing prices toward an [[economic equilibrium|equilibrium]] that balances the demands for the products against the supplies.&lt;ref&gt;''Theory of Value'', by [[Gérard Debreu]]&lt;/ref&gt; At these equilibrium prices, the market distributes the products to the purchasers according to each purchaser's preference (or utility) for each product and within the relative limits of each buyer's [[purchasing power]]. This result is described as market efficiency, or more specifically a [[Pareto optimum]].

This equilibrating behavior of free markets requires certain assumptions about their agents, collectively known as [[perfect competition]], which therefore cannot be results of the market that they create. Among these assumptions are several which are impossible to fully achieve in a real market, such as complete information, interchangeable goods and services, and lack of market power. The question then is what approximations of these conditions guarantee approximations of market efficiency, and which failures in competition generate overall market failures. Several [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences|Nobel Prizes in Economics]] have been awarded for analyses of market failures due to [[asymmetric information]].

===Low barriers to entry===
{{main|Barriers to entry}}
A free market does not require the existence of competition, however it does require a framework that allows new market entrants. Hence, in the lack of coercive barriers, and in markets with low entry cost it is generally understood that competition flourishes in a free-market environment. It often suggests the presence of the [[profit motive]], although neither a profit motive or profit itself are necessary for a free market.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} All modern free markets are understood to include [[entrepreneur]]s, both individuals and [[business]]es. Typically, a modern free market economy would include other features, such as a [[stock exchange]] and a [[financial services]] sector, but they do not define it.

===Spontaneous order===
{{Main|Invisible hand|Spontaneous order}}
[[Friedrich Hayek]] popularized the view that market economies promote [[spontaneous order]] which results in a better "allocation of societal resources than any design could achieve."&lt;ref&gt;Hayek cited. Petsoulas, Christina. ''Hayek's Liberalism and Its Origins: His Idea of Spontaneous Order and the Scottish Enlightenment''. Routledge. 2001. p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; According to this view, in market economies are characterized by the formation of complex transactional networks which produce and distribute goods and services throughout the economy. These networks are not designed, but nevertheless emerge as a result of decentralized individual economic decisions. The idea of spontaneous order is an elaboration on the [[invisible hand]] proposed by [[Adam Smith]] in ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]''.  Smith wrote that the individual who:

{{quote|By preferring the support of domestic to that of foreign industry, he intends only his own security; and by directing that industry in such a manner as its produce may be of the greatest value, he intends only his own gain, and he is in this, as in many other cases, led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention. Nor is it always the worse for society that it was no part of it. By pursuing his own interest [an individual] frequently promotes that of the society more effectually than when he really intends to promote it. I have never known much good done by those who affected to trade for the [common] good.|Adam Smith, ''[[Wealth of Nations]]''}}

Smith pointed out that one does not get one's dinner by appealing to the brother-love of the butcher, the farmer or the baker. Rather one appeals to their self-interest, and pays them for their labor.

{{quote|It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer or the baker, that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own self-interest. We address ourselves, not to their humanity but to their self-love, and never talk to them of our own necessities but of their advantages.|Adam Smith&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Smith | first = Adam | author-link = Adam Smith | title = Wealth of Nations | place = London | publisher = W. Strahan and T. Cadell | year = 1776 | month= | volume = 1 | edition = | chapter = 2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Supporters of this view claim that spontaneous order is superior to any order that does not allow individuals to make their own choices of what to produce, what to buy, what to sell, and at what prices, due to the number and complexity of the factors involved. They further believe that any attempt to implement central planning will result in more disorder, or a less efficient production and distribution of goods and services.

Critics, such as political economist [[Karl Polanyi]], question whether a spontaneously ordered market can exist, completely free of "distortions" of political policy; claiming that even the ostensibly freest markets require a state to exercise coercive power in some areas – to enforce [[contract]]s, to govern the formation of [[labor union]]s, to spell out the rights and obligations of [[corporation]]s, to shape who has standing to bring legal actions, to define what constitutes an unacceptable [[conflict of interest]], etc.&lt;ref&gt;''Winner-Take-All Politics: How Washington Made the Rich Richer – and Turned Its Back on the Middle Class'' by [[Jacob S. Hacker]] and [[Paul Pierson]], Simon &amp; Schuster 2010, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt;

===General principles===
[[The Heritage Foundation]], a [[Right-wing politics|right-wing]] [[think tank]], tried to identify the key factors necessary to measure the degree of freedom of economy of a particular country. In 1986 they introduced the [[Index of Economic Freedom]], which is based on some fifty variables. This and other similar indices do not ''define'' a free market, but measure the ''degree'' to which a modern economy is free, meaning in most cases, free of state intervention. The variables are divided into the following major groups:
* Trade policy,
* [[Fiscal burden of government]],
* Government intervention in the economy,
* Monetary policy,
* Capital flows and foreign investment,
* Banking and finance,
* Wages and prices,
* Property rights,
* Regulation, and
* Informal market activity.
These free market principles are what helped America transition to a free market economy. International free trade improved the country and in order for Americans to prosper from a strong economy they had no choice but to embrace it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The World Transformed: 1945 To The Present|last=Hunt|first=Michael H|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2004|isbn=|location=Boston: Bedford/St. Martin's|pages=313}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each group is assigned a numerical value between 1 and 5; IEF is the arithmetical mean of the values, rounded to the nearest hundredth. Initially, countries which were traditionally considered capitalistic received high ratings, but the method improved over time. Some economists, like [[Milton Friedman]] and other [[Laissez-faire|laissez-faire economists]] have argued that there is a direct relationship between economic growth and economic freedom, and some studies suggest this is true.&lt;ref name=CHICAGO&gt;[http://www.freetheworld.com/papers/Ayal_and_Karras.pdf Ayal, Eliezer B. and Karras, Georgios.

Publisher: Western Illinois University.&lt;/ref&gt; Ongoing debates exist among scholars regarding methodological issues in empirical studies of the connection between economic freedom and economic growth.  These debates and studies continue to explore just what that relationship entails.&lt;ref name=COLE&gt;[http://www.econjournalwatch.org/pdf/ColeLawsonRejoinderJanuary2007.pdf COLE, Julio H. and LAWSON, Robert A.

The principles of a free market are defined as:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freemarketprinciples.com/principles.php Principles of the Free Market] Free Market Monument Foundation, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;
# Individual Rights: "We are each created with equal individual rights to control and to defend our life, liberty and property and to voluntary contractual exchange."
# Limited Government: "Governments are instituted only to secure individual rights, deriving their just powers from the [[consent of the governed]]."
# Equal Justice Under Law: "Government must treat everyone equally; neither rewarding failure nor punishing success."
# Subsidiarity: "Government authority must reside at the lowest feasible level."
# Spontaneous Order: "When individual rights are respected, unregulated competition will maximize economic benefit for society by providing the most goods and services possible at the lowest cost."
# Property Rights: "Private ownership is the most efficient way to sustainably utilize resources."
# The Golden Rule: "Deal with others honestly and require honesty in return."

==Criticisms==
{{see also|Criticism of capitalism}}
Critics of the free market have argued that, in real world situations, it has proven to be susceptible to the development of [[price fixing]] monopolies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Tarbell|first= Ida |authorlink=Ida Tarbell|title= The History of the Standard Oil Company|publisher= McClure, Phillips and Co.|year= 1904|month= |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such reasoning has led to government intervention, e.g. the [[United States antitrust law]].

Two prominent Canadian authors argue that government at times has to intervene to ensure competition in large and important industries. [[Naomi Klein]] illustrates this roughly in her work ''[[The Shock Doctrine]]'' and [[John Ralston Saul]] more humorously illustrates this through various examples in ''The Collapse of Globalism and the Reinvention of the World''.&lt;ref name="The End of Globalism. Saul, John"&gt;Saul, John ''The End of Globalism''.&lt;/ref&gt; While its supporters argue that only a free market can create healthy competition and therefore more business and reasonable prices, opponents say that a free market in its purest form may result in the opposite. According to Klein and Ralston, the merging of companies into giant corporations or the privatization of government-run industry and national assets often result in monopolies (or oligopolies) requiring government intervention to [[Competition law|force competition]] and reasonable prices.&lt;ref name="The End of Globalism. Saul, John"/&gt; Another form of market failure is [[speculation]], where transactions are made to profit from short term fluctuation, rather from the [[intrinsic value (finance)|intrinsic value]] of the companies or products.

This criticism has been challenged by historians such as [[Lawrence Reed]], who argued that monopolies have historically failed to form even in the absence of anti-trust law.&lt;ref&gt;[https://fee.org/articles/41-rockefellers-standard-oil-company-proved-that-we-needed-anti-trust-laws-to-fight-such-market-monopolies/ "Cliche #41: “Rockefeller’s Standard Oil Company Proved That We Needed Anti-Trust Laws to Fight Such Market Monopolies"], ''[[The Freeman]]'', January 23, 2015. Retrieved December 20, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; This is because monopolies are inherently difficult to maintain: a company that tries to maintain its monopoly by buying out new competitors, for instance, is incentivizing newcomers to enter the market in hope of a buy-out.

American philosopher and author [[Cornel West]] has derisively termed what he perceives as [[dogma]]tic arguments for laissez-faire economic policies as "[[market fundamentalism|free-market fundamentalism]]". West has contended that such mentality "trivializes the concern for public interest" and "makes money-driven, poll-obsessed elected officials deferential to corporate goals of profit – often at the cost of the common good."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theglobalist.com/cornel-west-democracy-matters/ "Cornel West: Democracy Matters"], ''[[The Globalist]]'', January 24, 2005. Retrieved October 9, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; American political philosopher [[Michael J. Sandel]] contends that in the last 30 years the United States has moved beyond just having a market economy and has become a market society where literally everything is for sale, including aspects of social and civic life such as education, access to justice and political influence.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael J. Sandel]] (June 2013). [http://www.ted.com/talks/michael_sandel_why_we_shouldn_t_trust_markets_with_our_civic_life Why we shouldn't trust markets with our civic life]. [[TED (conference)|TED]]. Retrieved January 11, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The economic historian [[Karl Polanyi]] was highly critical of the idea of the market-based society in his book ''[[The Great Transformation (book)|The Great Transformation]]'', noting that any attempt at its creation would undermine human society and the common good.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Farrell (July 18, 2014). [https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2014/07/18/the-free-market-is-an-impossible-utopia/ The free market is an impossible utopia]. ''[[The Washington Post]].'' Retrieved January 11, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics of free market economics range from those who reject markets entirely in favour of a [[planned economy]] as advocated by various [[Marxism|Marxists]], to those who wish to see market failures regulated to various degrees or supplemented by government interventions. [[Keynesian economics|Keynesians]] support market roles for government, such as using fiscal policy for economic stimulus when actions in the private sector lead to sub-optimal economic outcomes of [[depression (economics)|depressions]] or [[recession]]s. Business cycle theory is used by Keynesians to explain ''[[liquidity trap]]s'', by which underconsumption occurs, to argue for government intervention with fiscal policy.

Some would argue, only one known example of a true free market exists, which is the [[black market]].{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} The black market is under constant threat by the [[police]], but under no circumstances do the police regulate the substances that are being created. The black market produces wholly unregulated goods, and are purchased and consumed unregulated. That is to say, anyone can produce anything at any time, and anyone can purchase anything available at any time. The alternative view is that the black market is not a free market at all since high prices and monopolies are often enforced through murder, theft and destruction. Black markets can only exist peripheral to regulated markets where laws are being regularly enforced.

==Early life==
Fekkai was born and raised in [[Aix-en-Provence]], [[France]]. His father was Algerian and his mother Vietnamese. 
In 1979 at the age of 21, Fekkai moved to New York to start his career.&lt;ref name=HPVillageJan08&gt;http://www.hpvillage.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/Fekkai_January.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life and work ==
Davis obtained his AB in philosophy and psychology at the [[University of Michigan]] in 1984, his MA in Sociology from [[Stanford University]], and his PhD in Organizational Behavior at the [[Stanford Graduate School of Business]] in 1990.

After graduation Davis started his academic career at [[Northwestern University]]'s [[Kellogg Graduate School of Management]] as assistant professor in 1990, and got promoted to associate professor. In 1994 he returned to the Stanford University Graduate School of Business as associate professor, and got promoted to full professor. In the year 1997–98 he was research fellow at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences in Stanford, California. Since 2001 he is professor of sociology   at the [[Ross School of Business]] at the [[University of Michigan]], where he was also professor of management and organizations from 2002 to 2004. 

Davis described his research interests as "broadly concerned with the effects of finance on society.  Recent writings examine how ideas about corporate social responsibility have evolved to meet changes in the structures and geographic footprint of multinational corporations; whether "shareholder capitalism" is still a viable model for economic development; how income inequality in an economy is related to corporate size and structure; why theories about organizations do (or do not) progress; how architecture shapes social networks and innovation in organizations; why stock markets spread to some countries and not others; and whether there exist viable organizational alternatives to shareholder-owned corporations in the United States."&lt;ref&gt;[http://webuser.bus.umich.edu/gfdavis/ Jerry Davis] at ''bus.umich.edu,'' Accessed 25.01.2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''[[Howard M. Metzenbaum]] U.S. Courthouse''' is a historic [[courthouse]] and [[post office]] building located on Superior Avenue in [[Downtown Cleveland|downtown]] [[Cleveland]], [[Cuyahoga County, Ohio]]. Its west side faces [[Public Square, Cleveland|Public Square]] and its north side faces [[The Mall (Cleveland)|The Mall]]. It was formerly the '''Federal Building and U.S. Courthouse''' and also known as Old Federal Building and Post Office.

==Building history==

The Howard M. Metzenbaum U.S. Courthouse, also known as the Federal Building and U.S. Courthouse, is a monumental anchor to Cleveland's Civic Mall. Fronting the Mall and Public Square, it was the first building erected under Cleveland's 1903 Group Plan, which illustrates the urban planning ideals of the [[City Beautiful movement]].&lt;ref name ="GSA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gsa.gov/portal/ext/html/site/hb/category/25431/actionParameter/exploreByBuilding/buildingId/525|title=GSA - Find a Building|date=2009-08-24|work=Howard M. Metzenbaum U.S. Courthouse, Cleveland, OH : Building Overview|publisher=U.S. General Services Administration}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New York Architect [[Arnold W. Brunner]] (1857–1925) designed this imposing building under the direction of [[Office of the Supervising Architect|Supervising Architect]] of the Treasury [[James Knox Taylor]] (1857–1929). It is one of 35 buildings constructed during Taylor's tenure (1883–1912) that were designed by independent architects commissioned by the U.S. Treasury Department under the Tarsney Act. The 1893 Act authorized the Secretary of the Treasury to use private architects, selected through competitions, to design Federal buildings. As a process, it manifested the growing demand for greater architectural standards for public buildings and opened the way for additional appropriations to maintain those standards.&lt;ref name ="GSA"/&gt;

As the first building erected under the Group Plan, the federal building was the model for later structures. The Group Plan proposed that local and federal government buildings be placed around a grand Mall. Embraced from the late 19th century into the first decades of the 20th century, the City Beautiful movement had its beginnings with the monumental planning and predominately classical architectural style of the 1893 [[World's Columbian Exposition]] in Chicago. Celebrated architect [[Daniel Burnham]], who was instrumental in promoting the nationwide adoption of City Beautiful Movement principles, served as a member of the design team that produced the Group Plan. Arnold W. Brunner, working as an independent architect, and John Merven Carrère, of the prominent New York firm of [[Carrère and Hastings]], also served on the team. The Federal Building formed one half of the Mall's termination at Superior Avenue. [[Cleveland Public Library|Cleveland's Public Library]] (1925), forming the other half of this terminus, emulates the Federal Building in scale, mass, and general overall appearance.&lt;ref name ="GSA"/&gt;

The building was listed in the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1974.&lt;ref name ="nris"/&gt; On May 27, 1998, the building was officially renamed in honor of U.S. Senator [[Howard Metzenbaum]] of Ohio.&lt;ref name ="GSA"/&gt;

==Architecture==
[[File:Courthouse eagle.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|One of the decorative stone eagles at the building's roofline]]
The Howard M. Metzenbaum U.S. Courthouse is one of Cleveland's great monumental public buildings, skillfully illustrating the strong, classical characteristics of [[Beaux-Arts architecture]]. The five-story, granite-faced building was constructed between 1903 and 1910. The building covers the entire city block bounded by Rockwell Avenue on the north, Superior Avenue on the south, East Third Street on the east, and Public Square on the west.&lt;ref name ="GSA"/&gt;

Inspiration for the design of this Beaux Arts building came from the [[Place de la Concorde]] in Paris as well as the work of French architect and theorist Francois Blondel. The resulting design presents a [[rustication (architecture)|rusticated]] first floor and {{convert|42|ft|m|adj=mid|-high}} [[Corinthian order]] columns and [[pilaster]]s on each elevation. These massive columns and pilasters define the sequence of window bays on the second, third, and fourth stories. Rusticated stone-arched windows with carved keystones adorn the first story. The more ornate second-story windows are capped with classically inspired [[pediment]]s and [[balustrade]]d sills. The third- and fourth-story window openings have molded surrounds and bracketed sills. Screening the fifth floor is an expansive [[entablature]] capped by a balustraded parapet that rises nine feet. A low-hipped, standing-seam copper roof crowns the building with attic [[dormer]] windows facing the interior light court. The [[parapet]]s are adorned with shields and carved stone eagles at the building's corners.&lt;ref name ="GSA"/&gt;

The main entrance to the building is centered on the Superior Avenue facade. Granite steps lead to three rusticated stone arches once fitted with cast bronze doors and ornate bronze lanterns hang from cast bronze brackets. The original doors have been replaced.&lt;ref name ="GSA"/&gt;

Flanking the primary entrance are two important sculptures executed by the famed sculptor [[Daniel Chester French]] (1850–1931). "''Jurisprudence''" is located on the Public Square corner, while ''Commerce'' sits at the corner of East Third Street and Superior Avenue. "''Jurisprudence''" is personified by a mother figure clasping her baby while a criminal crouches in chains. "''Commerce''" is depicted as a female figure holding a model ship in one hand while her other arm rests on a globe representing the opportunity for world trade. At her right is "''Electricity''," symbolized by a female figure holding a magnet catching electrical sparks. "''Steam''," located to her left, is represented by a male figure grasping a wheel.

On the interior, the grand main lobby dominates the first floor as it runs east to west across the entire length of the building. The floors, walls, and vaulted ceiling of the lobby are surfaced with marble. Original chandeliers illuminate the space. The postal service windows are located along the lobby's north wall. Marble stairs wrap around three sides of the elevator shafts, located at the east and west ends of the public lobby. Cast-bronze, spread-wing eagles standing on globes appear over each pair of elevator doors. Corner offices in the upper floors are adorned with impressive murals depicting significant events in the history of Cleveland. Among the magnificent artworks are "''City of Cleveland Welcomes the Arts''" by [[Will Hicok Low]] (1853–1932), and the "''Battle of Lake Erie''" by [[Rufus Fairchild Zogbaum]] (1849–1925). Murals in the ceremonial courtrooms on the third floor are "''The Common Law''" by [[Henry Siddons Mowbray]] (1858–1928), and "''The Law''" by [[Edwin Howland Blashfield]] (1848–1936).&lt;ref name ="GSA"/&gt;

A major renovation project to restore public spaces and modernize the mechanical systems was initiated in 2002. Although the primary activities of the U.S. District Court system have moved to the new [[Carl B. Stokes Federal Court House Building]] a few blocks west, the ceremonial courtrooms in the Metzenbaum Courthouse will continue to be used for public hearings and proceedings. New client agencies moving into the renovated building will include the U.S. Bankruptcy Court, the Office of the U.S. Trustee, and the U.S. Marshals Service.&lt;ref name ="GSA"/&gt;

'''John Clarence Cudahy''' (December 10, 1887 – September 6, 1943) was an American real estate developer and diplomat. In the years leading up to [[World War II]], Cudahy served as United States ambassador to [[Poland]] and [[Belgium]], and as United States minister to [[Luxembourg]] and the [[Irish Free State]].&lt;ref name=sheb /&gt;&lt;ref name=JCC /&gt;

==Early life==
Cudahy was born in [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]], the son of [[Patrick Cudahy]] the [[meat packing industry|meat packing]] industrialist and Anna Cudahy. He graduated from [[Harvard University]] in 1910 and from the [[University of Wisconsin Law School]] in 1913.&lt;ref name=APobit&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/10577084/john_cudahy_obit/ |title=John Cudahy, Former Envoy, Killed In Fall From Horse |url-access=limited |newspaper=[[Arizona Republic]] |location=[[Phoenix, Arizona]] |agency=[[Associated Press|AP]] |via=newspapers.com |date=September 7, 1943 |accessdate=April 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cudahy served during [[World War I]] as a lieutenant in Company B of the U.S. Army's [[339th Infantry Regiment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/10577143/john_cudahy_obit/ |title=Ex-Envoy Is Killed In Fall from Horse |url-access=limited |newspaper=[[Battle Creek Enquirer]] |location=[[Battle Creek, Michigan]] |agency=[[Associated Press|AP]] |via=newspapers.com |date=September 7, 1943 |accessdate=April 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This regiment was part of the [[Polar Bear Expedition]], which was sent to north Russia to intervene on behalf of the anti-communist forces in the [[Russian Civil War#Course of events|Russian Civil War]]. On November 14, 1918, Cudahy led a counter-attack that succeeded in breaking through and routing the 1,000 Bolshevik troops that on November 11 ([[Armistice Day]]) had encircled and [[Battle of Tulgas|attacked]] the 600 American, Canadian, and Royal Scots soldiers who were holding the village of [[Tulgas]] on the [[Northern Dvina River]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=When Hell Froze Over |first=E.

Back in the [[United States]], Cudahy headed his family's real estate company, building the Cudahy Tower Apartments on the shore of [[Lake Michigan]] in [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin|Milwaukee]].

==Diplomatic service==
Between 1933 and 1940, Cudahy served the United States as minister to several European nations.

From September 6, 1933, until April 23, 1937, Cudahy served as the American ambassador to [[Poland]].&lt;ref name=JCC&gt;{{cite web |url=https://history.state.gov/departmenthistory/people/cudahy-john-clarence |title=John Clarence Cudahy (1887–1943) |website=history.state.gov |accessdate=April 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; His time in Poland was marked by a militarily backed government under [[Józef Piłsudski]] and continued tensions between Poland and [[Nazi Germany]] under [[Adolf Hitler]].

From August 23, 1937, Cudahy served as [[United States Ambassador to Ireland|minister to the Irish Free State]], which became the [[Republic of Ireland]] in December 1937. His official title was [[Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary]], and he served until January 15, 1940.&lt;ref name=JCC /&gt;

In January 1940, Cudahy became both the ambassador to [[Belgium]] and the minister to [[Luxembourg]].&lt;ref name=JCC /&gt; He was forced to leave these posts after Germany occupied Luxembourg and Belgium in May 1940, and the nations set up [[Government in exile|governments-in-exile]].

In 1941, ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine commissioned Cudahy to interview Hitler, which he did at [[Berghof (residence)|Berghof]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Cudahy|first=John|date=9 June 1941|title=Hitler on Americas: Life Correspondent Interviews Führer on War and the Future|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jUwEAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA34|magazine=Life|pages=34–36}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cudahy later authored the book ''The Armies March'', recounting his experiences in Europe leading up to the war, including the [[Battle of Belgium]] and his meeting with Hitler.

==Death and descendants==
Cudahy died in September 1943, when he was thrown from a horse on his [[Brown Deer, Wisconsin|Brown Deer]] estate north of [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin|Milwaukee]].&lt;ref name=sheb&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/10366688/cudahy_death/ |title=John Cudahy, Diplomat Well Known Here, Dies In Fall From Horse Sunday |url-access=limited |newspaper=[[The Sheboygan Press]] |location=[[Sheboygan, Wisconsin]] |via=newspapers.com |date=September 7, 1943 |accessdate=April 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cudahy's son, [[Michael Cudahy (electronics)|Michael Cudahy]], founded [[Marquette Electronics]] and became a major philanthropist in the city of [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin|Milwaukee]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://biztimes.com/article/20130513/MAGAZINE03/130519971/ |title=Michael Cudahy receives BizTimes Lifetime Achievement Award |accessdate=2014-07-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140728223043/http://biztimes.com/article/20130513/MAGAZINE03/130519971/ |archivedate=2014-07-28 |website=BizTimes.com |first=Steve |last=Jagler |date=May 13, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cudahy's daughter, Mary Keogh-Stringer (born Mary Toulgas Cudahy), was a successful artist;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tributes.com/obituary/show/Mary-Keogh-Stringer-102092851 |title=Mary Keogh-Stringer |date=January 19, 2015 |website=tributes.com |accessdate=April 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; the dedication of ''The Armies March'' reads;

'''Juha Petri Sipilä''' ({{IPA-fi|ˈjuhɑ ˈsipilæ}}; born in [[Veteli]], 25 April 1961) is the current [[Prime Minister of Finland]]. A relative newcomer to politics, he has a successful background in business.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.euronews.com/2015/04/19/opposition-leader-juha-sipila-wins-elections-in-finland/&lt;/ref&gt;  He has been the [[Centre Party (Finland)|leader of the Centre Party]] since 9 June 2012. After leading the Centre party to victory in the [[Finnish parliamentary election, 2015|2015 general election]], Sipilä formed a [[Sipilä Cabinet|centre-right coalition]] and was appointed Prime Minister by the [[Finnish Parliament]] on 29 May 2015.&lt;ref&gt;http://yle.fi/uutiset/mps_vote_sipila_in_as_prime_minister__result_not_unanimous/8025742 YLE News: MPs vote Sipilä in as prime minister- result not unanimous. 28 May 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education and military service==
Sipilä graduated from [[Puolanka]] [[Gymnasium (school)#Northern European countries|lukio]] (Finland's university-preparatory high school), completing the [[Matriculation exam (Finland)|matriculation examination]] with high marks in 1980.&lt;ref name="Koskinen1"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.iltasanomat.fi/vaalit2015/art-1427799759029.html| title = Näin Juha Sipilä on muuttunut – katso lukio-, hää- ja lapsuuskuvat| work = Iltasanomat| author=Mika Koskinen | date=March 31, 2015| accessdate = August 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1986 Sipilä earned his [[diplomi-insinööri|Master's degree in science (technology)]] from the [[University of Oulu]].

Sipilä has the rank of Captain in the reserves of the [[Finnish Defence Forces]].&lt;ref name="military"/&gt;

==Business==
Sipilä's career started at Lauri Kuokkanen Ltd., first as a thesis worker and later as a product development manager.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} Changing jobs, he became a partner and later CEO at Solitra Oy.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} In 1998, Sipilä started his own business, Fortel Invest Oy. In 2002–2005 he worked as the CEO of [[Elektrobit]] Oyj, then returned to his own business.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

Sipilä was managing director of Solitra in 1992 and became the main owner in 1994. Sipilä sold Solitra to American [[ADC Telecommunications]] in 1996, becoming a multimillionaire from the proceeds. Business ADC Mersum Oy was resold to Remec in 2001.&lt;ref name=0Kaleva&gt;[http://htf.kaleva.fi/index.cfm?j=371030 Yritysuutiset8.1.2004]{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kilpailuvirasto.fi/cgi-bin/suomi.cgi?luku=yrityskauppavalvonta/yrityskaupparatkaisut&amp;sivu=ratk/r-2001-81-0935 Yrityskaupan hyväksyminen; Remec, Inc. / ADC Mersum Oy] 26.10.2001&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, Sipilä's income was the highest in Finland. According to ''Ilta-Sanomat'' he has been on the Board of Directors of 120 companies.&lt;ref&gt;Vaatimaton miljonääri Ilta-Sanomat 12.6.2012 s.6-7&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Chempolis Involvement ===
Juha Sipilä was part-owner in the start-up company Chempolis. According to MOT Program (YLE) in 2012, Chempolis had received 10 million euros in public funds over 15 years along with extra funds from the Finnish Innovation Fund [[SITRA]] and Finnish state-owned financing company [[Finnvera]]. According to YLE TV News in 2017, the majority state-owned energy company [[Fortum]] saved Chempolis from bankruptcy by investing 6 million euros into the company in October 2016. Thereafter, children of Sipilä owned 5% of the company and Fortum 34%. Sipilä had been in control of the state owned companies including Fortum since the end of 2015. The Prime Ministers of Finland have not had the control of state companies previously.&lt;ref&gt;[http://yle.fi/uutiset/3-9395763 Valtionyhtiö Fortum pelasti konkurssikypsän teknologiayhtiön – omistajaohjauksesta vastaavan pääministeri Sipilän lapset yhtiön omistajina] YLE 10.1.2017&lt;/ref&gt;

Prime Minister Juha Sipilä lobbied for Chempolis in India in 2016. Chempolis issued a press release on its joint venture with India's Numaligarh Refinery to build a biorefinery in North East India (Assam) for the production of bioethanol following meetings between Prime Minister [[Narendra Modi]], India’s Finance Minister [[Arun Jaitley]] and Finland’s Prime Minister Juha Sipilä on 12–14 February 2016.&lt;ref&gt;[http://yle.fi/uutiset/osasto/news/iltalehti_pm_lobbied_for_finnish_biotech_in_india_company_partly_owned_by_his_children_received_110_million_euro_deal/9395277 ltalehti: PM lobbied for Finnish biotech in India – company partly owned by his children received 110 million euro deal] YLE News 10.1.2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics==
As a student, Sipilä worked for a short time in the [[Finnish Centre Youth]], but otherwise he did not have experience in party politics before being elected to the Finnish Parliament in 2011 with 5,543 personal votes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hs.fi/politiikka/Juha+Sipil%C3%A4+Keskustan+johtoon/a1305573721743 Juha Sipilä] accessed 9 June 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Miska Rantanen 2012"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hs.fi/english/print/1329104294448 |title=PROFILE: Juha Sipilä |author= Miska Rantanen |date=2012 |work= |publisher=Helsingin Sanomat |accessdate=28 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2012, Sipilä announced his candidacy for the chairman's position in the party congress of the summer. On June 9, 2012, the party congress elected him chairman.  He beat [[Tuomo Puumala]] in the second round by 1251 to 872 delegate votes.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} Sipilä led his party to victory in the 2015 election, where the Centre Party gained 14 seats compared to the previous election. With 30,758 personal votes he was the most popular candidate in the election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tulospalvelu.vaalit.fi/E-2015/fi/kokomaaval.html |title=Valitut ehdokkaat Koko maa |date=22 April 2015 |publisher=Ministry of Justice |accessdate=9 May 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160625063910/http://tulospalvelu.vaalit.fi/E-2015/fi/kokomaaval.html |archivedate=25 June 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the election, he was tasked with forming a government coalition; and as the leader of the Centre Party, he began formal negotiations with the [[Finns Party]] and the [[National Coalition Party]] and formed a [[Sipilä cabinet|three-party majority coalition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://yle.fi/uutiset/kolmen_assan_humppa__seuraa_hallitusohjelmavaantoa_smolnassa_hetki_hetkelta/7978517 |title= Kolmen ässän humppa – seuraa hallitusohjelmavääntöä Smolnassa hetki hetkeltä |date= 8 May 2015 |publisher=Yle |accessdate=9 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Sipilä's Government===
Sipilä's government has struggled with Finland's poor economic performance,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-35656150|title=Finland: The sick man of Europe?|last=Walker|first=Andrew|date=2016-02-29|newspaper=BBC News|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; caused according to [[Paul Krugman]] and others by the constraints of its [[eurozone]] membership and aftershocks from the [[European debt crisis]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=[[Paul Krugman]]|title=Northern Discomfort|website=The Conscience of a Liberal|publisher=''[[New York Times]]''|accessdate=26 October 2016|location=https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/05/29/northern-discomfort/|date=29 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=[[Paul Krugman]]|title=The Finnish Disease|website=The Conscience of a Liberal|publisher=''[[New York Times]]''|accessdate=26 October 2016|location=https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/06/01/the-finnish-disease/?_r=0|date=1 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; but also by the decline of the paper industry, the fall of [[Nokia]] and a diminution in exports to [[Russia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://euobserver.com/beyond-brussels/132860|title=In Finland, the euro is not the real problem|last=|first=|date=|work=|publisher=|newspaper=EUobserver|access-date=2016-11-06|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bruegel.org/2015/12/finland-and-asymmetric-shocks/|title=Finland and asymmetric shocks {{!}} Bruegel|website=bruegel.org|access-date=2016-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="walker"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Walker|first1=Andrew|title=Finland: The sick man of Europe?|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-35656150|website=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=14 November 2016|date=29 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Finland's economic winter|url=https://www.economist.com/news/business-and-finance/21689751-nordic-laggard-can-forge-ahead-reforms|website=''[[The Economist]]''|accessdate=14 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its attempts to address the problems through policies of spending cuts and reducing labour costs have been controversial, particularly cuts to education spending that are seen as threatening Finland's successful public education system.&lt;ref name="walker" /&gt;&lt;ref name="macdougall"&gt;{{cite web|last1=MacDougall|first1=David|title=Down and Out in Helsinki|url=http://www.politico.eu/article/finland-economy-crisis-alexander-stubb-finnish-education/|website=[[Politico]]|accessdate=26 October 2016|date=18 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; These austerity measures have partly been implemented due to [[European Commission]] pressure, which has urged Finland to improve its adherence to the [[Stability and Growth Pact]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Goulard|first1=Hortense|title=Commission tells six EU countries to cut budget deficit|url=http://www.politico.eu/article/commission-tells-six-eu-countries-to-cut-budget-deficit/|website=[[Politico]]|accessdate=26 October 2016|date=9 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and reform its labour market to improve competitiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Council recommendation on the 2016 national reform programme of Finland  and  delivering a Council opinion on the 2016 stability programme of Finland|url=http://ec.europa.eu/europe2020/pdf/csr2016/csr2016_finland_en.pdf|publisher=European Commission|accessdate=26 October 2016|pages=4–5|date=18 May 2016|quote=(8) To restore Finland's competitiveness, the functioning of the labour market must be improved in several ways. On an aggregate level, wage increases have been moderate since the centrally agreed wage deal was agreed in late 2013. Under the agreement, the year-on-year increase in negotiated wages slowed from 1.3% in the last quarter of 2013 to 0.5 % in the fourth quarter of 2015. In June 2015, the social partners decided to extend the agreement into 2016. However, labour productivity growth has not yet recovered and therefore nominal unit labour costs are forecast to increase, albeit more slowly. Negotiations have been carried out to restore cost-competitiveness.}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 22 July 2015, Sipilä announced his government's commitment to reducing Finnish wage costs by 5% by 2019, an [[internal devaluation]] caused by Finland's loss of the ability to devalue its currency to boost competitiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hirst|first1=Tomas|title=What's happening to Finland's economy?|url=https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2015/07/whats-happening-to-finland-economy/|website=[[World Economic Forum]]|accessdate=14 November 2016|date=23 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been protests against the government's austerity measures.&lt;ref name="macdougall" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Finland: Economic forecast summary (June 2016)|url=http://www.oecd.org/economy/finland-economic-forecast-summary.htm|website=[[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]]|accessdate=14 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017 summer [[Finns Party|Finns]] [[Finns Party|Party]] split into two parties The [[Blue Reform]] and the current [[Finns Party]]. The Blue Reform members of the former Finns Party, including all ministers, remained in the government after the split.

=== Talvivaara and Yleisradio scandal ===
In 2016, Sipiläs close relatives were revealed to be part-owners of the bankrupt [[Talvivaara Mining Company]], later renamed and re-organised into the company Terrafame, which had received considerable funds from the Finnish government.&lt;ref&gt;[http://yle.fi/uutiset/3-9288420 Antaisitko 150 euroa Talvivaaran kaivokselle?

However, it was later revealed that Sipilä had contacted [[Yleisradio]] in order to instruct them on how to report on the Talvivaara and Terrafame incidents, leading to suspicion that YLE had been politically pressured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mistä pääministerin ja Ylen välisessä jupakassa on kyse?

==Personal life==

===Family===
Sipilä grew up in the small town of [[Puolanka]], northern Finland, east of Oulu, the firstborn of four children to mother Pirkko and father Pentti Sipilä, an elementary school teacher.&lt;ref name="Koskinen1"/&gt;

In 1981, Sipilä married Minna-Maaria Juntunen at [[Oulu Cathedral]]. They have five children.&lt;ref name="Koskinen1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Koskinen2"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.iltasanomat.fi/kotimaa/art-1427787326707.html| title = Juha Sipilän suhde vaimoonsa alkoi 16-vuotiaana erikoisesta tarjouksesta| work = Iltasanomat| author=Mika Koskinen | date=March 31, 2015| accessdate = August 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Their youngest son, Tuomo (born in 1993), died on 18 February 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yle.fi/uutiset/juha_sipila_steps_back_from_election_campaign_after_son_dies/7815272|title=Juha Sipilä steps back from election campaign after son dies|publisher=[[Yle]]|date=19 February 2015|accessdate=19 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wood Gas Venture===
Sipilä is known for his interest in [[wood gas]] electricity generation, which began as a hobby.&lt;ref name="Miska Rantanen 2012"/&gt; The cost to bring power to his summer cottage seemed too high, and he became interested in [[wood gas]]. First, he produced the electricity with wind power and with a diesel generator, but then he started building wood gas plants. He converted an old Chevrolet El Camino into "El Kamina" (''Kamiina'' means "stove" in Finnish.) powered by wood gas, with electronic control systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZdPkrghUZM|title=El Kamina – häkäpönttöauto|date=4 June 2010|work=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; This hobby was spun off into a company, Volter Oy, which produces wood gas power plants. A 10-house [[ecovillage]] in Kempele is powered by one such power plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://volter.fi/fi/portfolio/kempeleen-ekokortteli/|title=Kempeleen ekokortteli|work=Volter}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yle.fi/uutiset/kempeleen_ekokortteli_pyrkii_energiaomavaraisuuteen/5888863|title=Kempeleen ekokortteli pyrkii energiaomavaraisuuteen|work=Yle Uutiset}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religious affiliation===
The Sipiläs are members of Rauhan Sana (transl. "Word of Peace", affiliated in North America with [[Apostolic Lutheran Church of America|ALCA]]), a small [[Laestadian]] revivalist denomination within the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland|state Lutheran church of Finland]]. The Sipiläs first met at a Laestadian summer camp as teenagers.&lt;ref name="Koskinen2"/&gt;  Sipilä has stated he does not consider himself a legalistic Laestadian, and in interviews he has carefully distinguished his own Laestadian denomination from his home region's other, predominant, exclusive Laestadian group ([[Conservative Laestadianism]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.iltalehti.fi/eduskuntavaalit-2015/2015041419515861_eb.shtml | title=Tällainen on Sipilän herätysliike – ei abortille ja eutanasialle | date = April 15, 2015 | accessdate = July 24, 2015 | work = Ilta-Lehti}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.kaleva.fi/uutiset/oulu/sipila-linjasi-suhdettaan-lestadiolaisuuteen/594972/ | title = Sipilä linjasi suhdettaan lestadiolaisuuteen| work = Kaleva| date=May 30, 2012| accessdate = June 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/reuters/article-3029205/Finland-poll-leader-open-deal-eurosceptic-populists.html| title = Finland poll leader open to deal with eurosceptic populists| work = Daily Mail UK| date=April 7, 2015| accessdate = August 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The chairman of board in Juha Sipilä's religious community was his wife’s brother in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iltalehti.fi/eduskuntavaalit-2015/2015041419515861_eb.shtml  Tällainen on Sipilän herätysliike - ei abortille ja eutanasialle] Iltalehti 15.4.2015&lt;/ref&gt; According to Juha Sipilä, in 2012 he participated in the International Christian Chamber of Commerce ICCC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kaleva.fi/uutiset/oulu/sipila-linjasi-suhdettaan-lestadiolaisuuteen/594972/ Sipilä linjasi suhdettaan lestadiolaisuuteen] Kaleva 30.5.2012&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Laurits Christian Meulengracht''' or '''Laurits Christopher Meulengracht''' (14 February 1837 - 9 April 1903) was a [[Denmark|Danish]] businessman and [[brewer]] who became one of the wealthiest men in Denmark in the 19th century. He received the [[Order of the Dannebrog]] and [[Order of the Dannebrog|Knight of the Dannebrog]].&lt;ref name="ACA"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://aarhuswiki.dk/wiki/Lars_Christian_Meulengracht_(1837-1903) |title=Lars Christian Meulengracht (1837-1903) |publisher=Aarhus City Archives |language=Danish |accessdate=12 September 2016 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6kTKzHJ3h?url=http://aarhuswiki.dk/wiki/Lars_Christian_Meulengracht_(1837-1903) |archive-date=12 September 2016 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lund"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lundskov.dk/menu/aarhusperson.htm |title=Meulengracht slægten |publisher=Lundskov |language=Danish |accessdate=12 September 2016 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130701052124/http://www.lundskov.dk/menu/aarhusperson.htm |archive-date=1 July 2013 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

His father Lars Christian Meulengracht died 6 months before he was born so he grew up in his grandfather [[Harboe Meulengracht]]'s house. 15 years old he started an internship in the store of Malthe Conrad Lottrup, a local businessman who among other things owned a sizable brewery. In 1858 he was sent to [[Copenhagen]] to study trade further and in 1862 he started a successful business in [[London]]. However, by 1870 his former mentor Malthe Conrad Lottrup had fallen ill and called Meulengracht home to take over management of Lottrup's [[Ceres Brewery]].&lt;ref name="DSD"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://denstoredanske.dk/Dansk_Biografisk_Leksikon/H%C3%A5ndv%C3%A6rk/Brygger/L._Chr._Meulengracht |title=L.

Meulengracht took over the brewery and managed it through a lifetime. Initially he rationalized and bought new technology in the form of an [[steam engine]]. In the years 1872-88 a large expansion program was undertaken that eventually made Ceres the largest brewery in [[Jutland]] and Meulengracht one of the wealthiest people in Aarhus. Tax records show he paid more in taxes than even contemporary [[Otto Mønsted]] and [[Hans Broge]]. Meulengracht eventually moved into a new home on the Ceres-complex which eventually became a social focal point for the local upper class. As an employer he was known for his ability to make opposing groups work together and privately Meulengracht was active in charity and advocacy work. In 1876 he was elected to the city council and held his seat for 14 years, working in numerous committees particularly on public works and infrastructure. Meulengracht was also one of the forces behind the establishment [[Aarhus Theatre]] and he sat on the first board after it was opened.&lt;ref name="ACA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DSD"/&gt;

Laurits Meulengracht died 9 April 1903, after lengthy illness and during a healing trip to [[Monte Carlo]]. He was buried on [[Nordre Cemetery]] in Aarhus.

== Honors == 
Meulengracht had the official honorary title of ''etatsråd'' and he received the [[Order of the Dannebrog]] and [[Order of the Dannebrog|Knight of the Dannebrog]].&lt;ref name="DSD"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1496">In [[olive oil extraction]], '''malaxation''' ([[Latin]] ''malaxare'', [[Greek language|Greek]] '''''μαλακος''''' meaning "soft") is the action of slowly churning or mixing milled [[olive]]s, typically for 20 to 40 minutes.  The churning allows the smaller droplets of [[oil]] released by the milling process to aggregate and be more easily separated. The paste is normally heated to around 27&amp;nbsp;°C during this process. Oil yield is proportional to the temperature and mixing time. However, the use of higher temperatures and longer mixing times increases [[oxidation]] of the oil and therefore decreases shelf life, so a compromise must be struck. Also, the usage of higher temperatures does not allow for the labelling of the oil as "cold extracted", a term used widely as a marketing tactic, especially in the [[European Union]].

It is now possible with newer equipment to use a blanket of [[inert gas]] such as [[nitrogen]] or [[carbon dioxide]] over the olive paste, which greatly reduces oxidation. This allows for an increased yield without compromising the quality of the oil.

After malaxation is complete, the paste is sent to a phase separator. Nearly all producers use a [[decanter centrifuge]] for this process. Traditionally the olive oil was separated from the paste using a large press that was either screwed down or weighted with rocks.

The '''Brazilian National Association of Cargo Transport and Logistics''' (pt-BR, "Associação Nacional do Transporte de Cargas e Logística"), '''NTC&amp;Logistica''', or simply '''NTC''') is a Brazilian organisation founded in 1963 by Orlando Monteiro and based in [[São Paulo]], with a branch in [[Brasilia]]. This association represents cargo carriers and [[Logistics|logistical operators]]. From its foundation until the mid-1990s, it represented only road cargo transport companies, but later it expanded its services to other transport modals, as well as to logistical operators (stocking and storage).  It is also responsible for calculating the Brazilian National Index of Transport Costs (INCT), which measures variations in costs incurred of the transport sector throughout the country. It gives a prize annually to companies for providing the best services to transport businesses (vehicles, suppliers, and others), through a satisfaction survey developed by Brazilian statistical institute [[Datafolha]].

''' Peter Grubb ''' ({{circa}}1702{{mdash}}1754), the founder of the [[Grubb Family Iron Dynasty]], discovered [[Cornwall, Pennsylvania|Cornwall Iron Mines]] and established [[Cornwall Iron Furnace]], together one of the largest ironworks in Colonial Pennsylvania.&lt;ref name=payton&gt;{{cite book | last = Payton | first = Philip | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = The Cornish Overseas | publisher = Alexander Associates  | year = 1999 | location = Fowey, Cornwall UK | doi = | id = | isbn = | page = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Cornwall Iron Mines are the largest U.S. iron mines ever discovered east of [[Lake Superior]].

The youngest of the seven sons of [[John Grubb]] and his wife Frances of [[Brandywine Hundred]], Peter first learned the stonemasonry trade.  In 1729, he built a water corn and boulting mill in Bradford, Pennsylvania.  He constructed his first iron [[bloomery]] (a crude form of furnace) in 1737 at Furnace Creek, on the modern border of [[Lancaster County, Pennsylvania|Lancaster]] and [[Lebanon County, Pennsylvania|Lebanon]] counties.&lt;ref name=cope&gt;{{cite book | last = Cope | first = Gilbert | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = The Grubb Family of Delaware and Pennsylvania | publisher = | year = 1893 | location = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = | page = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Grubb constructed a regular iron furnace, known as [[Hopewell (on Hammer Creek)|Hopewell on Hammer Creek]] near his bloomery.  As he started to operate Hopewell, Peter soon located three mountains of magnetic iron ore just west of the furnace. He decided to mine the ore and by 1739 had acquired over {{convert|1000|acre|km2}} that he called Cornwall Iron Mines, in honor of his father's birthplace. In 1742, he opened Cornwall Iron Furnace to take advantage of the discovery.  Peter Grubb's [[Hopewell (on Hammer Creek)|Hopewell Forge Mansion]], completed around 1740 and later occupied by his son [[Peter Grubb, Jr.|Peter Jr.]], still stands about six miles (10&amp;nbsp;km) from Cornwall on present-day Route 322.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Dieffenbach | first = Susan | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Cornwall Iron Furnace, Pennsylvania Trail of History Guide | publisher = Stackpole Books  | year = 2003 | location = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = | page = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1745 Peter decided to relinquish direct control of the ironworks, and he leased the operation to Cury and Company for 20 years at £250 a year. He moved with his wife to [[Wilmington, Delaware]], where he engaged in the buying and selling of real estate and lived out his life.&lt;ref name = dibert&gt;{{cite book | last = Dibert | first = James | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Iron, Independence and Inheritance - the Story of Curttis and Peter Grubb | publisher = Cornwall Iron Furnace Associates  | year = 2000 | location = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = | page = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legacy ==

Peter's sons [[Curtis Grubb|Curtis]] and [[Peter Grubb, Jr.|Peter Jr.]] inherited the ironworks after his death in 1754.&lt;ref name = bining&gt;{{cite book | last = Bining | first = Arthur | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Pennsylvania Iron Manufacture in the Eighteenth Century | publisher = Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission  | year = 1987 | location = Harrisburg  | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = | page = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  They took over operation around 1765, after the lease expired, and quickly expanded the business, later becoming significant providers of munitions to the Revolutionary War effort.  Unfortunately, most of the Cornwall ironworks fell out of the Grubb family's hands by 1802. But later generations, starting with Peter Jr.'s son [[Henry Bates Grubb]], built on the remaining holdings with great success. From 1840 to 1870 the Grubbs were among the leading iron manufacturers in Pennsylvania, with [[Mount Hope Estate]] serving as their center of operations.&lt;ref name = dibert /&gt;

==Personal life==

On 2nd mo. 12, 1732 at Caln Meeting, Peter Grubb married Martha Bates (or Bate), widow of James Wall.&lt;ref name="Clement"&gt;Clement, John (1877). "William Bates".

'''Philip Kotler''' (born May 27, 1931) is an American [[marketing]] author, consultant, and professor; currently the S. C. Johnson Distinguished Professor of International Marketing at the [[Kellogg School of Management]] at [[Northwestern University]]. He is the author of over 60 marketing books, including ''Marketing Management'', ''Principles of Marketing'', ''Kotler on Marketing'', ''Marketing Insights from A to Z'', ''Marketing 4.0'', ''Marketing Places'', ''Marketing of Nations'', ''Chaotics, Market Your Way to Growth, Winning Global Markets, Strategic Marketing for Health Care Organizations, Social Marketing, Up and Out of Poverty,'' and ''Winning at Innovation.'' Kotler describes strategic marketing as serving as "the link between society's needs and its pattern of industrial response."&lt;ref name="MW 2003"&gt;{{cite news|author=[[Morgen Witzel|Witzel, Morgen]]|title= First Among Marketers|work= Financial Times|date= August 6, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kotler helped create the field of social marketing that focuses on helping individuals and groups modify their behaviors toward healthier and safer living styles.

Kotler's latest work focuses on economic justice and the shortcomings of capitalism. He published ''Confronting Capitalism: Real Solutions for a Troubled Economic System'' in 2015, ''Democracy in Decline: Rebuilding its Future'' in 2016, and ''Brand Activism: From Purpose to Action'' in 2018.

==Early life==
Both of Kotler's parents, Betty and Maurice, emigrated in 1917 from Russian Empire (currently territory of Ukraine) and settled in Chicago,&lt;ref&gt;http://londred.com/en/news/25&lt;/ref&gt; where Kotler was born on May 27, 1931. He studied at [[DePaul University]] for two years and was accepted without a bachelor's degree into the Master's program at the [[University of Chicago]] (1953{{clarify|date=April 2014}}) and his PhD at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (1956{{clarify|date=April 2014}}), earning both degrees in economics. He studied under three [[Nobel Laureate]]s in [[Economic science|Economic Science]]: [[Milton Friedman]], [[Paul Samuelson]], and [[Robert Solow]]. He did a year of [[Postdoctoral researcher|postdoctoral]] work in mathematics at [[Harvard University]] and in [[behavioral science]] at the University of Chicago.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

==Views about marketing==
{{external media | width = 210px | float = right | headerimage =| video1 = [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sR-qL7QdVZQ Philip Kotler: Marketing], [[Chicago Humanities Festival]], 57:30, Kotler starts speaking at 3:30 | date =November 26, 2012 | accessdate =July 14, 2017 }}
Kotler started teaching marketing in 1962 at the [[Kellogg School of Management]], Northwestern University.  He believed marketing was an essential part of economics and saw [[Demand (economics)|demand]] as influenced not only by price but also by [[advertising]], [[sales promotion]]s, [[sales|sales force]]s, [[direct mail]], and various middlemen (agents, [[retailer]]s, [[wholesalers]], etc.) operating as sales and [[distribution channel]]s.

Philip Kotler holds that: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"the organization's marketing task is to determine the needs, wants and interests of target markets and to achieve the desired results more effectively and efficiently than competitors, in a way that preserves or enhances the consumer's or society's well-being."&lt;ref name="MW 2003"/&gt;  &lt;/blockquote&gt;

He links the profit motive to the satisfaction of consumer wants and society's well-being. In order to market effectively, Kotler believes the marketing purpose of elevating consumer well-being has to be put at the heart of company strategy and be practiced by all managers.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

In 2003, the ''[[Financial Times]]'' cited Kotler's three major contributions to marketing and to management:

&lt;blockquote&gt;First, he has done more than any other writer or scholar to promote the importance of marketing, transforming it from a peripheral activity, bolted on to the more "important" work of production.  Second, he continued a trend started by Peter Drucker, shifting emphasis away from price and distribution to a greater focus on meeting customers' needs and on the benefits received from a product or service. Third, he has broadened the concept of marketing from mere selling to a more general process of communication and exchange, and has shown how marketing can be extended and applied to charities, arts organizations, political parties and many other non-commercial situations.&lt;ref name="MW 2003"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Kotler argued for broadening the field of marketing to cover not only commercial operations but also the operations of [[non-profit organization]]s and government agencies.  He held that marketing can be applied not only to products, services, and experiences, but also to causes, ideas, persons, and places. Thus a museum needs the marketing skills of Product, Price, Place, and Promotion (the [[4P's]]) if it is to be successful in attracting visitors, donors, staff members, and public support. Kotler and [[Gerald Zaltman]] created the field of [[social marketing]], which applies marketing theory to influence behavior change that would benefit consumers, their peers, and society as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|authors=Kotler, Philip &amp; Zaltman, Gerald |title=Social Marketing: An Approach to Planned Social Change|work= Journal of Marketing|date= July 1971|volume= 35|issue=3|pages= 3–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Kotler and Sidney Levy developed the idea of [[demarketing]], which organizations must employ to reduce overall or selective demand when demand is too high.  Thus, when water is in [[short supply]], the government needs to persuade various water consumers to reduce water usage so that enough water will be available for essential uses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|authors=Kotler, Philip &amp; Levy, Sidney J. |title=Demarketing, Yes, Demarketing|work= Harvard Business Review|date= November–December 1971|volume= 49|issue= 6|pages= 74–80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writings and activities==
In 1967, Kotler published ''Marketing Management: Analysis, Planning, and Control'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Kotler, Philip |title=Marketing Management: Analysis, Planning and Control |location=Englewood Cliffs, N.J.|publisher= Prentice-Hall|year= 1967}}&lt;/ref&gt; now in its 15th edition,{{when|date=April 2014}} and the world's most widely adopted textbook in graduate schools of business.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} Whereas previous marketing textbooks were highly descriptive, this text was the first to draw on [[economic science]], [[organizational theory]], [[Behavioral psychology|psychology of behavior and choice]], and [[Marketing Analytics|analytics]].  It described [[Marketing Theory|theory]] and practice, and drew on findings from [[Empirical study|empirical studies]] and [[Case study|cases]]. On December 9, 1996, the ''[[Financial Times]]'' cited ''Marketing Management'' as one of the 50 greatest business books of all time.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

Kotler is the author and co-author of over 150 published articles and 60 books,{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} [https://amazon.com/Philip-Kotler/e/B0028DGITO], [http://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/faculty/directory/kotler_philip.aspx]

Kotler has also written books on such subjects as [[corporate social responsibility]], education, environment, government marketing, [[Healthcare industry|healthcare]], [[Hospitality industry|hospitality]], [[innovation]], museums, [[performing arts]], [[place marketing]], poverty alleviation, [[professional services]], religious institutions, [[Tourism industry|tourism]], [[capitalism]], and [[democracy]].

Kotler was invited to be the first Legend in Marketing. His published articles are presented, analyzed, and commented on in the nine-volume ''Legends in Marketing Series: Philip Kotler'', edited by Professor Jagdish Sheth.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

In 2014, he started a blog on fixcapitalism.com that featured many articles on making capitalism work better for more people.

In 2016, he became an advisor to [http://www.marketingjournal.org/ ''The Marketing Journal''], an online site dedicated to sharing insights and next practices in marketing.

In 2017, Kotler published his autobiography - [https://www.amazon.com/dp/0990576760/ ''My Adventures in Marketing''], an account of his experiences from his formative years to the present, including his views on topics such as demarketing, brand activism, marketing of the arts, place marketing, as well as the challenges facing capitalism and democracy.

==Honorable distinctions==
In 1975, Kotler was the first person to receive the "Leader in Marketing Thought" award&lt;ref name="MW 2003"/&gt; voted on by the academic members of the [[American Marketing Association]].

The ''Financial Times'' on November 18, 2005 surveyed 1,000 executives in 25 countries about the Most Influential Business Writers/Management Gurus, and Kotler ranked fourth after Peter Drucker, [[Bill Gates]], and [[Jack Welch]]. Kotler's contributions are described in at least one chapter found in every book written about the "[[guru]]s" of business and management (see References below).{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

On February 16, 2013, he was the first recipient of the William L. Wilkie "Marketing for a Better World" award from the American Marketing Association to "honor marketers who have significantly contributed to the understanding and appreciation for marketing's potential to improve the world."&lt;ref&gt;''Financial Times'' (2003), ibid.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, in 2013 he was the first recipient of the Sheth Foundation Medal for Exceptional Contribution to Marketing Scholarship and Practice.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

On November 7, 2013, Kotler received the Badge of Honor of Officer of the Order of Academic Palms established in France in the 19th Century.

On November 19, 2013, Kotler was inducted into the Management Hall of Fame, along with 10 other management gurus(see [[www.thinkers50.com/hall-of-fame/]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19557">In [[patent]], [[industrial design rights]] and [[trademark]] [[law]]s, a '''priority right''' or '''right of priority''' is a time-limited [[right]], triggered by the first filing of an application for a patent, an [[Industrial design rights|industrial design]] or a trademark respectively. The priority right allows the claimant to file a subsequent application in another country for the same [[invention]], design, or trademark effective as of the date of filing the first application. When filing the subsequent application, the applicant must '''claim the priority''' of the first application in order to make use of the right of priority. The right of priority belongs to the applicant or his ''successor in [[Title (property)|title]]''.

The period of priority, i.e., the period during which the priority right exists, is usually 6 months for industrial designs and trademarks and 12 months for patents and [[utility model]]s. The period of priority is often referred to as the '''priority year''' for patents and utility models.

In [[patent law]], when a priority is validly claimed, the date of filing of the first application, called the '''priority date,''' is considered to be the '''effective date of filing''' for the examination of  [[novelty (patent)|novelty]] and [[inventive step and non-obviousness|inventive step or non-obviousness]] for the subsequent application claiming the priority of the first application. In other words, the [[prior art]] which is taken into account for examining the novelty and inventive step or non-obviousness of the invention [[claim (patent)|claim]]ed in the subsequent application would not be everything made available to the public before the [[filing date]] (of the subsequent application) but everything made available to the public before the priority date, i.e. the date of filing of the first application.

== Rationale ==

The "basic purpose [of the right of priority] is to safeguard, for a limited period, the interests of a patent applicant in his endeavour to obtain international protection for his invention, thereby alleviating the negative consequences of the principle of territoriality in patent law."&lt;ref&gt;[http://legal.european-patent-office.org/dg3/pdf/t010015ex1.pdf Decision T 15/01 of June 17, 2004 of the Board of Appeal of the European Patent Office.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929131611/http://legal.european-patent-office.org/dg3/pdf/t010015ex1.pdf |date=September 29, 2007 }}. See also [http://www.epo.org/law-practice/case-law-appeals/recent/t110577eu1.html Decision T 577/11 of 14 April 2016], Reasons 6.5.3, 5&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; paragraph: "The creation of the right of priority was aimed at protecting the rights of the applicant of a first application for an invention in all countries of the Paris Union by securing the filing date as the effective date for the definition of the state of the art. This was to enable the applicant to decide, within a certain period, in which other countries protection should be sought in respect of the same invention and to prepare for such subsequent filings which, in the absence of a centralised filing system, were still required at that time. In the event of such subsequent filings, other applications or disclosures occurring in the priority period were to have no negative effect as regards the patentability of the invention (see Article 4B Paris Convention)."&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types ==

=== Convention priority right ===

The "Paris Convention priority right", also called "Convention priority right" or "Union priority right", is a "priority right" under a multilateral arrangement, defined by Article 4 of the [[Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property]] of 1883. The Convention priority right is probably the most widely known priority right. It is defined by its Article 4 A.(1):

{{cquote|Any person who has duly filed an application for a patent, or for the registration of a utility model, or of an industrial design, or of a trademark, in one of the countries of the Union, or his successor in title, shall enjoy, for the purpose of filing in the other countries, a right of priority during the periods hereinafter fixed.&lt;ref name ="ART4PC"&gt;[http://www.wipo.int/treaties/en/ip/paris/trtdocs_wo020.html#P83_6610 Article 4 Paris Convention]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Article 4 B. of the Paris Convention describes the effects of the priority right:

{{cquote|Consequently, any subsequent filing in any of the other countries of the Union before the expiration of the periods referred to above shall not be invalidated by reason of any acts accomplished in the interval, in particular, another filing, the publication or exploitation of the invention, the putting on sale of copies of the design, or the use of the mark, and such acts cannot give rise to any third–party right or any right of personal possession.&lt;ref name ="ART4PC"/&gt;}}

Article 2 paragraph 1 of the [[World Trade Organization|WTO]] [[Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights]] (TRIPs Agreement) in conjunction with the Paris Convention provides a "derived" Convention priority right.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wto.org/english/docs_e/legal_e/27-trips_03_e.htm Article 27 TRIPs Agreement]&lt;/ref&gt; That is, while WTO members need not ratify the Paris Convention, they should however comply with Articles 1 through 12, and Article 19, of the Paris Convention. (For a comparative list of the States party to the Paris Convention and the members of the WTO, see for instance ''States Party to PCT/Paris/WTO]'' on the WIPO web site&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wipo.int/pct/en/texts/pdf/pct_paris_wto.pdf States Party to PCT/Paris/WTO on the WIPO web site (Adobe PDF)]&lt;/ref&gt;).

=== Priority rights under other multilateral arrangements ===
Some priority rights are defined by a multilateral convention such as the [[European Patent Convention]] (EPC)&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|87|1}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the [[Patent Cooperation Treaty]] (PCT).&lt;ref name="8PCT"&gt;{{PCT Article|8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Paris Convention does not cover priorities claimed &lt;U&gt;in&lt;/U&gt; a European patent application or &lt;U&gt;in&lt;/U&gt; an international application (or PCT application), as the EPC and the PCT have their own legal provisions regarding priority.

==== European Patent Convention ====

{{EPC Article|87|1}} defines the priority right system under the EPC or more precisely recognise priority rights for first filings in or for States party to the Paris Convention or any Member of the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO):&lt;ref&gt;Under the European Patent Convention (EPC), rights of priority may be obtained from the filing of patent applications in Members of the World Trade Organization which are not party to the Paris Convention since December 13, 2007, the date of entry into force of the [[EPC 2000]], the revised version of the EPC.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|Any person who has duly filed, in or for

(a) any State party to the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property or

(b) any Member of the World Trade Organization,

an application for a patent, a utility model or a utility certificate, or his successor in title, shall enjoy, for the purpose of filing a European patent application in respect of the same invention, a right of priority during a period of twelve months from the date of filing of the first application.}}

{{EPC Article|89}} describes the effect of the priority right:

{{cquote|The right of priority shall have the effect that the date of priority shall count as the date of filing of the European patent application for the purposes of Article 54, paragraphs 2 and 3, and Article 60, paragraph 2.}}

As explained by the [[Appeal procedure before the European Patent Office|Enlarged Board of Appeal of the European Patent Office (EPO)]] in its decision [[G 3/93]] of August 16, 1994 (Reasons 4):

{{cquote|Articles 87 to 89 EPC provide a complete, self-contained code of rules of law on the subject of claiming priority for the purpose of filing a European patent application (cf. decision J 15/80, OJ EPO 1981, 213).

The Paris Convention also contains rules of law concerning priority. The Paris Convention is not formally binding upon the EPO. However, since the EPC - according to its Preamble - constitutes a special agreement within the meaning of Article 19 of the Paris Convention, the EPC is clearly intended not to contravene the basic principles concerning priority laid down in the Paris Convention (cf. decision T 301/87, OJ EPO 1990, 335, reasons point 7.5).''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epo.org/law-practice/case-law-appeals/recent/g930003ep1.html Decision G3/93 of August 16, 1994 of the Enlarged Board of Appeal of the European Patent Office]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Regarding the critical question "What is 'the same invention'?" in {{EPC Article|87|1}}, opinion [[G 2/98]] prescribes a photographic approach to the assessment of priority.&lt;ref&gt;Hans-Rainer Jaenichen, Olaf Malek, [http://216.92.57.242/patentepi/data/epi_03_2008.pdf ''The Assessment of priority cannot demand more than science can deliver or: How to apply the photographic approach in consideration of the resolving of the pictures taken'']{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, [[epi Information]] 3/2008, pp. 91-102.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Enlarged Board of Appeal opinion G 2/98, the requirement for claiming priority of "the same invention" means that priority of a previous application in respect of a claim in a European patent application is to be acknowledged only if the skilled person can derive the subject-matter of the claim directly and unambiguously, using [[common general knowledge]], from the previous application as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;European Patent Office, [http://www.epo.org/law-practice/case-law-appeals/recent/g980002ex1.html Opinion of the Enlarged Board of Appeal dated 31 May 2001, G 2/98], point 9: "It means that priority of a previous application in respect of a claim in a European patent application in accordance with Article 88 EPC is to be acknowledged only if the person skilled in the art can derive the subject-matter of the claim directly and unambiguously, using common general knowledge, from the previous application as a whole."&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Patent Cooperation Treaty ====

The Patent Cooperation Treaty, in its Article 8(1), provides the possibility of claiming a right of priority for the filing of an international application (PCT application):
{{cquote|The international application may contain a declaration, as prescribed in the Regulations, claiming the priority of one or more earlier applications filed in or for any country party to the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property.&lt;ref name="8PCT"/&gt;}}

{{PCT Rule|4|10|a}} goes on to mention that:
{{cquote|Any declaration referred to in Article 8(1) ("priority claim") may claim the priority of one or more earlier applications filed either in or for any country party to the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property or in or for any Member of the World Trade Organization that is not party to that Convention.&lt;ref&gt;{{PCT Rule|4}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

However, Rule 4.10(a) as amended with effect from January 1, 2000 does not apply to all designated Offices.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wipo.int/pct/en/texts/rules/r4.htm#note1 Rule 4, note 1, Patent Cooperation Treaty]&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, for the [[European Patent Office]] as designated Office, the old Rule 4.10(a) still applied until December 12, 2007, that is, rights of priority of first applications made in a WTO member not party to the Paris Convention were not recognised. Now and more specifically for European patent applications filed on or after December 13, 2007 (the entry into force of the new version of the [[European Patent Convention]], the so-called [[EPC 2000]]), the rights of priority of first applications made in a WTO member are recognized under the European Patent Convention.&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|87|1|b}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.european-patent-office.org/epo/pubs/oj007/08_07/special_edition_4_epc_2000_synoptic.pdf Special edition of the Official Journal of the EPO 4/2007 - Revision of the European Patent Convention (EPC 2000). Synoptic presentation EPC 1973/2000 – Part I: The Articles], 2007 (PDF, 1.72 MB), page 88.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Internal priority rights ===
Some priority rights, called "internal priority rights", are defined by some national laws.&lt;ref&gt;For instance, in Canada: [[Manual of Patent Office Practice]] (MOPOP), [http://strategis.ic.gc.ca/sc_mrksv/cipo/patents/mopop/ch07-e.pdf ''Chapter 7: Internal priority and convention priority].&lt;/ref&gt; Such internal priority right allows an applicant who filed a first application in a given country to claim the priority of the first application when filing a subsequent application in the same country. The Paris Convention does not cover internal priority rights.  ''See, e.g., [[provisional application]] in the US.''

=== Priority rights under bilateral agreements ===
Some priority rights also exist on the basis of bilateral agreements.&lt;ref&gt;For instance, bilateral agreements with [[Taiwan]]: Government Information Office, Republic of China (Taiwan), [http://www.gio.gov.tw/taiwan-website/5-gp/Ipr/ipr01a.htm ''Taiwan's commitment to protect intellectual property rights. Cooperative Agreements Signed between Taiwan with Other Nations''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705093143/http://www.gio.gov.tw/taiwan-website/5-gp/Ipr/ipr01a.htm |date=2008-07-05 }}, Consulted on November 11, 2007.. Agreement No. 3 "''Mutual Recognition of Invention Patent Priority Right with [[Germany]]''", No. 5 "''Mutual Recognition of Patent Priority Right with [[Switzerland]]"'', etc... are bilateral agreements on priority rights for patents. Other bilateral agreements relate to trademarks and industrial designs.&lt;/ref&gt; A bilateral agreement between a first and a second country may allow an applicant who filed an application in the first country to claim the priority of the first application when filing a second application in the second country. These kinds of bilateral agreements usually involve at least one country not party to the Paris Convention.

== Example ==

An example may help to understand the legal concept of priority right. The example presented here illustrates the case of the priority right in patent law, but the example could be extended to trademarks, taking into account the difference of priority period (12 months for patents, 6 months for trademarks).

[[Image:2005 mousetrap cage 1.jpg|thumb|right|Ms. A's hypothetical improved mousetrap.]] 
Let us imagine the following scenario. Ms. A has invented an improved [[mousetrap]] and decides to apply for a patent on her mousetrap. She first files a [[Germany|German]] patent application on July 15, 2006. Starting from July 16, 2006,&lt;ref&gt;The day of filing is not included in the period - Article 4 C.(2) Paris Convention.&lt;/ref&gt; Ms. A has then one year to file patent applications in other countries to be able to benefit from the date of filing of the German patent application in these other countries. If Ms. A files on July 15, 2007 a patent application in the [[United Kingdom]] (UK) for her mousetrap, and if, upon filing the patent application in the United Kingdom, Ms. A claims the priority of the earliest German patent application filed one year before,&lt;ref&gt;Under some jurisdictions, the priority claim need not be made upon filing. In the specific example used for instance, i.e. filing the patent application in the United Kingdom, Ms. A does not have to declare priority claim on filing. She has actually until 16 months from the claimed priority date to provide the number and certified copy of the earlier application using Patents Form 3 and paying £40, provided there was no early publication of new application (see [[Patent Rules 2007]], Rule 6). In addition (still in the specific example of filing the patent application in the United Kingdom), she could file an application up to two months after expiry of priority period and still validly claim priority using Patents Form 3 and paying £190 (which includes a late fee of £150) and filing evidence to show that the failure to meet the original deadline was unintentional (see [[Patents Act 1977]], section 5(2B) and the Patent Rules 2007, rule 7)).&lt;/ref&gt; the date for examining the novelty and inventive step requirements in the United Kingdom will be July 15, 2006, not July 15, 2007.

This means that any disclosure to the public of the improved mousetrap on or after July 15, 2006 (by Ms. A or anyone else) will not prejudice Ms. A's patent application in the United Kingdom. If Mr. B independently invents around January 2007 the same improved mousetrap and decides to directly publish in February 2007 a paper explaining how his new mousetrap works, the publication of the paper by Mr. B will not affect the novelty of Ms. A's patent application in the United Kingdom, even though the publication of Mr. B's paper takes place before the actual date of filing of Ms. A's UK patent application.

The priority system, including this one-year priority right, enables Ms. A to file a patent application as soon as possible in one country (in this case in Germany, and in the [[German language]]), and gives her one-year to do whatever is necessary to file patent applications in other countries (translating the text of the application, filling the application forms, sending the translated application and forms to the foreign patent offices, collecting the funds to pay the filing fees, and so on) without being affected by any intervening publication. The actual date of filing in the United Kingdom remains July 15, 2007, and this is the date from which the 20-year duration of any ensuing patent is calculated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/guidance/manual-of-patent-practice-mopp/section-25-term-of-patent|title=Section 25: Term of patent  Sections (25.01 - 25.15)|date=March 2017|publisher=Intellectual Property Office|quote=The twenty-year term of the patent is measured from the date of filing.|accessdate=21 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The example also applies to many other countries, such as to all countries which are party to the Paris Convention.&lt;ref&gt;Example: {{Cite patent|GB|2418275}} filed on September 16, 2005 claims priority of a first filing in the US on September 17, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Special considerations ==

=== Partial priority ===
The extent to which a partial priority can be acknowledged for a single claim in a patent application -i.e., only for a part of the claim, for which the subject-matter is disclosed in the priority document- is a delicate question.&lt;ref&gt;For a discussion of the question, see for example [http://www.epo.org/law-practice/case-law-appeals/pdf/t100571eu1.pdf Decision T 0571/10 of 3 June 2014 of Board of Appeal 3.3.07 of the European Patent Office.]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2114">The '''Restrictive Trade Practices Act 1956''' was an act of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] intended to enforce [[competition (economics)|competition]]. It required that any agreement between companies that restricted trading should be placed on a public register unless granted exemption by the Secretary of State. Changes to an agreement, including its ending, were required to be notified and no agreement could be brought into force before appearing on the register.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/documents/information-management/osp34.pdf|title=Restrictive Trade Practices 1956-2000|work=The National Archives|pp=4.2|accessdate=30 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The registrar could refer any agreements which appeared to operate against the public interest to the '''Restrictive Practices Court''', a senior [[court of record]] in the [[United Kingdom]]. Though the Court was overhauled in 1976,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/RevisedStatutes/Acts/ukpga/1976/cukpga_19760033_en_1 Restrictive Practices Court Act 1976]&lt;/ref&gt; by the end of the century, the legislation was perceived as increasingly out of line with Articles 81 and 82 of the [[Treaty of Rome]]. The Court was gradually replaced by a new judicial regime under the [[Competition Act 1998]] and [[Enterprise Act 2002]]&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | publisher=Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform | title=Competition authorities | year=2008 | accessdate=2008-07-20 | url=http://www.berr.gov.uk/bbf/competition/authorities/index.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; and was ultimately disestablished on 10 March 2013.&lt;ref&gt;Competition Act 1998, [http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?ActiveTextDocId=1455854 s.1(a)], [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2013/284/contents/made SI284/2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3133">'''Strategic assumptions surfacing and testing''' ('''SAST''') is a method for approaching ill-structured problems.  It can be applied as a [[dialectical]] approach to policy and planning.

An ill-structured problem may alternatively be also labelled as a [[wicked problem]].  SAST may be applied as a technique of [[systems thinking]].

An ill-structured problem is "one for which various strategies for providing a possible solution rest on assumptions that are in sharp conflict with one another".&lt;ref&gt;Mitroff, I. I., and J. R. Emshoff. 1979. "On Strategic Assumption-making: A Dialectical Approach to Policy and Planning." ''Academy of Management Review'': 1–12. https://www.jstor.org/stable/257398&lt;/ref&gt;  The purposes for an SAST method are:
* to help surface for explicit examination the underlying assumptions that analysts often unconsciouly bring with them to a problem situation;
* to compare and to evaluate systematically the assumptions of different analysts;
* to examine the relationship between underlying assumptions and the resulting policies which are derived and dependent upon them; and
* to attempt to formulate new, novel, and originally unforeseen policies based on previously unforeseen assumptions.

Four stages in the method include:&lt;ref&gt;Mitroff, I. I., and J. R. Emshoff. 1979. “On Strategic Assumption-making: A Dialectical Approach to Policy and Planning.” ''Academy of Management Review'': 1–12. https://www.jstor.org/stable/257398&lt;/ref&gt;

# Assumption specification
# Dialectic phase 
# Assumption integration phase 
# Composite strategy creation

The method originated through the collaboration between [[Richard O. Mason]] and [[Ian Mitroff]], as an extension of the philosophy on the design of inquiring systems originating from [[C. West Churchman]].  SAST follows the prescriptions of ''dialectic inquiry'', sweeping in multiple perspective onto the full breadth of underlying assumptions to collaborative problem solving and strategic design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Acar | first1 = William | last2 = Druckenmiller | first2 = Douglas A. | year = 2010 | title = Designing Insightful Inquiring Systems for Sustainable Organizational Foresight | url = | journal = Futures | volume = 42 | issue = 4| pages = 405–416 | doi = 10.1016/j.futures.2009.11.025 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4026">'''Thore Albert Boye''' (27 October 1912 – 1 October 1999) was a Norwegian diplomat.

He was born in [[Oslo|Kristiania]] as a son of Supreme Court Justice [[Thorvald Boye]] (1871–1943) and Mia Esmarch (1880–1966). In 1945 he married Nøste Siem (1918–1999), a daughter of [[Ole Siem]] and sister of [[Martin Siem]].&lt;ref name=nbl&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|year=|title=Thore Boye|encyclopedia=[[Norsk biografisk leksikon]]|first=Kåre|last=Dæhlen|authorlink=Kåre Dæhlen|editor=[[Knut Helle|Helle, Knut]]|publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget|location=Oslo|url=http://www.snl.no/.nbl_biografi/Thore_Boye/utdypning|language=Norwegian|accessdate=4 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He took the [[cand.jur.]] degree in 1936, and was an attorney and deputy judge in [[Tromsø]] before being hired in the [[Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] in 1938.

After doing so he acted as a courier to Stockholm, returned to Molde where he followed the [[flight of the Norwegian National Treasury]] to [[Tromsø]]. From Tromsø, he left the country together with the government and [[Norwegian royal family|royal family]].

The '''Truth in Lending Act''' '''(TILA)''' of 1968 is a [[United States federal law]] designed to promote the informed use of [[consumer credit]], by requiring disclosures about its terms and cost to standardize the manner in which costs associated with borrowing are calculated and disclosed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Intro to Business|last1=Dlabay|first1=Les R. |last2=Burrow |first2=James L. |last3=Brad |first3=Brad |year=2009|publisher=South-Western [[Cengage Learning]]|location=[[Mason, Ohio]]|isbn=978-0-538-44561-0 |page=469}}&lt;/ref&gt;

TILA also gives consumers the right to cancel certain credit transactions that involve a [[lien]] on a consumer's principal dwelling, regulates certain [[credit card]] practices, and provides a means for fair and timely resolution of credit billing disputes. With the exception of certain high-cost [[mortgage loan]]s, TILA does not regulate the charges that may be imposed for consumer credit. Rather, it requires uniform or standardized disclosure of costs and charges so that consumers can shop. It also imposes limitations on home equity plans that are subject to the requirements of {{USCFR|12|1026|40}} and certain "higher-priced" mortgage loans (HPMLs) that are subject to the requirements of {{USCFR|12|1026|35}}. The regulation prohibits certain acts or practices in connection with credit secured by a consumer's principal [[dwelling]].

==History==
The Truth in Lending Act was originally Title I of the [[Consumer Credit Protection Act]], {{USStatute|90|321|82|146|1968|05|29}}. The regulations implementing the statute, which are known as "Regulation Z", are codified at {{USCFR|12|226}}. Most of the specific requirements imposed by TILA are found in Regulation Z, so a reference to the requirements of TILA usually refers to the requirements contained in Regulation Z, as well as the statute itself.&lt;ref name="FRB-regz"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/bankinforeg/reglisting.htm#Z |title=Federal Reserve System Banking Information and Regulation |date=July 30, 2008|work=Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System |publisher=FRB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From TILA's inception,  the authority to implement the statute by issuing regulations was given to the Federal Reserve Board (FRB). However, effective July 21, 2011, TILA's general rule making authority was transferred to the [[Consumer Financial Protection Bureau]] (CFPB), whose authority was established pursuant to provisions enacted by the passage of the [[Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act]] in July 2010. Any forthcoming regulations implementing the statute, which are also formally referred to as Regulation Z, will be codified at {{USCFR|12|1026}} and attempt to mirror the FRB's Regulation Z whenever feasible.&lt;ref name="CFPB-02-13-13"&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.consumerfinance.gov/newsroom/consumer-financial-protection-bureau-lays-out-implementation-plan-for-new-mortgage-rules/ |title=CFPB Lays Out Implementation Plan for New Mortgage Rules |date=February 13, 2013|work=Consumer Financial Protection Bureau |publisher=CFPB}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Federal Reserve will retain some limited rule making authority under TILA for loans made by certain motor vehicle dealers, and for certain other provisions.

The TILA introduced the Annual Percentage Rate (APR) calculation mandated for all consumer lenders.  Certain misleading interest rate calculations used previously, mainly on auto loans, were barred.  For more than a decade, consumer loans were reported by APR in an economically meaningful way.  Then in the 1980s the auto manufacturers began to exploit a loophole in TILA and its administration. Neither the Act nor its administrators adequately differentiated between "amount financed" and "finance charges," two terms that appear on the TILA required disclosure statements.  By "bundling" the price of the car and its financing charges (which come from the auto maker's captive finance company), auto makers were able to shift money between the two categories, even to eliminating the financing charge entirely.  Thus "zero percent APR" financing was born.

Typical offers from auto companies are "Zero Percent APR financing available or $1,000 rebate."  The consumer who elects "zero percent" financing gives up a $1,000 rebate (reduction in car price).  Effectively, he or she pays $1,000 to get the "interest free" loan.  Since only auto makers can do this type of bundling, banks, credit unions and other competitors are left at a disadvantage.  They must disclose true APR rates while the auto makers can claim no interest costs.  In the process, the typical consumer is left with a complex finance problem.  "Zero percent" financing can cost a lot less, or a lot more than conventional financing with a non-auto maker institution.

==Organization==
The regulation is divided into subparts.

Subpart B relates to open-end credit lines ([[revolving credit]] accounts), which includes credit card accounts and home-equity lines of credit (HELOCs).

Subpart C relates to closed-end credit, such as home-purchase loans and motor vehicle loans with a fixed loan term. It contains rules on disclosures, treatment of credit balances, [[annual percentage rate]] calculations, right of rescission,non requirements, and advertising.

Subpart D contains rules on oral disclosures, [[Spanish language]] disclosure in [[Puerto Rico]], record retention, effect on state laws, state exemptions (which only apply to states that had Truth in Lending-type laws prior to the Federal Act), and rate limitations.

Subpart E contains special rules for mortgage transactions.&lt;ref name="12CFR1026"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/granule/CFR-2013-title12-vol8/CFR-2013-title12-vol8-part1026-subpartE/content-detail.html |title=12 C.F.R. 1026, Subpart E, §§ 31–45 (2013 Edition)|date=January 1, 2013|work=Code of Federal Regulations|publisher=GPO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* § 1026.42 aims to promote valuation independence.

Several appendices contain information such as the procedures for determinations about state laws, state exemptions and issuance of staff interpretations, special rules for certain kinds of credit plans, a list of enforcement agencies, model disclosures which if used properly will ensure compliance with the Act, and the rules for computing [[annual percentage rate]]s in closed-end credit transactions and total annual loan cost rates for [[reverse mortgage]] transactions.


==Right of rescission==
{{unsourced section|date=May 2018}}
For certain transactions secured by a borrower's principle dwelling, TILA requires that the borrower be granted three business days following loan consummation to rescind the transaction. The right of rescission allows borrowers time to reexamine the credit agreement and cost disclosures, as well as to reconsider whether they want to place their homes at risk by offering it as security for the credit.  Each borrower and any person who has a vested interest in the property may exercise the right to rescind until midnight of the third business day following consummation, or delivery of all material disclosures, whichever occurs last.  If the required rescission notice or material TILA disclosures are inaccurate or not delivered, the borrowers right to rescind may be extended from three days after consummation to up to three years.

When a borrower rescinds, the security interest becomes void and the borrower is not liable for any amount, including finance charges.  The bank must return any money or property given to anyone in connection with the transaction within 20 calendar days and remove any record of security interest that the bank may have taken for the new loan.  Until the rescission period has ended, the bank may not 1) disperse funds other than to a valid escrow account, 2) perform any services, or 3) deliver any materials.

The right of rescission does not apply to loans that are obtained for the purpose of purchasing a home, nor does it apply to a refinance or consolidation of a home loan with the same creditor unless the amount refinanced or consolidated exceeds the unpaid balance on the existing debt.

==Exemptions==
TILA requirements do not apply to the following types of loans or credit:

* Credit extended primarily for business, agricultural or commercial purposes;
* Credit extended to an entity (not a person, with an exception for certain trusts for tax or estate planning), including government agencies or instrumentalities.
* Credit in excess of an annually adjusted threshold, not secured by real estate or personal property, used or expected to be used as a principal dwelling;

The Lindén group is the majority owner of Becker.&lt;ref&gt;[http://di.se/Avdelningar/Artikel.aspx?stat=0&amp;ArticleID=2009%5c01%5c14%5c319437&amp;SectionId=Ettan&amp;menusection=Startsidan;Huvudnyheter&amp;o=sp4 Skånes rikaste industriman död], Dagens Industri, January 14, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ulf G. Lindén was the CEO of Swedish chemical group [[Beckers AB|Beckers]] when he was hired by [[Volvo]] in 1979. Then, Volvo was the largest corporation in Sweden. Due to his tough management style, Lindén was nicknamed "[[Pehr G. Gyllenhammar]]'s [[hitman]]",&lt;ref&gt;Pehr G. Gyllenhammar was the President and CEO of Volvo.&lt;/ref&gt; especially after his role in turning down Volvo's merger with chemical group [[Fermenta]].

==Education==
Harnish received a bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering and an M.B.A. from [[Wichita State University]], where he founded and chaired the Association of Collegiate Entrepreneurs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/12/11/garden/entrepreneurs-the-new-heroes.html|title=ENTREPRENEURS: THE NEW HEROES|access-date=2018-08-17|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writing career==
Harnish is an author, often writing as the "Growth Guy" columnist for several publications.

In 2002, he published ''Mastering the Rockefeller Habits''. He created the "Rockefeller Habits" &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/business/small-business/build-it-like-rockefeller-20130903-2t3f8.html|title=Build it like Rockefeller|last=Courtenay|first=Adam|date=2013-09-09|website=The Sydney Morning Herald|language=en|access-date=2018-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/steve-mariotti/a-look-into-the-past-empa_b_4357731.html|title=A Look Into the Past: Empact100 Showcase Event Originates From ACE 100|last=Mariotti|first=Steve|date=2013-12-03|website=Huffington Post|language=en-US|access-date=2018-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; concept based on the leadership and management practices used by [[John D. Rockefeller]]. In the book, Harnish outlined three "pillars" to the habits: "Priorities", "Data" and "Rhythm". He recommends the practice of holding "huddles", or short daily meetings, in order for small business to maintain focus on strategic goals and establish accountability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.inc.com/magazine/20071101/the-art-of-the-huddle.html|title=The Art of the Huddle|accessdate=June 19, 2014|first=Leigh|last=Buchanan|work=Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sprout.nl/artikel/personeel/5-tips-van-groeigoeroe-verne-harnish-om-je-bedrijf-sneller-te-laten-groeien|title=5 tips van groeigoeroe Verne Harnish om je bedrijf sneller te laten groeien|work=Sprout|access-date=2018-08-17|language=nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.fastcompany.com/3001870/greatest-business-decisions-all-time|title=The Greatest Business Decisions Of All Time|date=2012-10-04|work=Fast Company|access-date=2018-08-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nu.nl/ondernemen/4347881/999-procent-van-ondernemers-moet-geen-investering-ophalen.html|title='99,9 procent van de ondernemers moet geen investering ophalen' {{!}} NU - Het laatste nieuws het eerst op NU.nl (in Dutch)|last=|first=|date=|website=www.nu.nl|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Violet Fults Bidwill Wolfner''' (January 10, 1902 – January 29, 1962) was the owner of the [[History of the Chicago Cardinals|Chicago]] / [[History of the St. Louis Cardinals (NFL)|St. Louis]] [[Arizona Cardinals|Cardinals]] of the [[National Football League]] (NFL) for over 14 years, from 1947 until her death in early 1962.&lt;ref name=sswhmh&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=KwJPAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=PwEEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6304%2C4506819 |newspaper=Toledo Blade |location=Ohio |agency=''(Chicago Daily News)'' |last=Fitzgerald |first=Adeline |title=She seldom wore her many hats |date=December 3, 1963 |page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; She inherited the team in April [[1947 Chicago Cardinals season|1947]], following the death of her husband [[Charles Bidwill|Charles Bidwill, Sr.]], who purchased the team in [[1933 Chicago Cardinals season|1933]]. She was the first woman to become principal owner of an NFL team.&lt;ref name=mwcodcdt&gt;{{cite news |url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1962/01/30/page/27/article/mrs-wolfner-cardinals-owner-dies |newspaper=Chicago Daily Tribune |agency=Associated Press |title=Mrs. Wolfner, Cardinals' owner, dies |date=January 30, 1962 |page=1, part 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Wolfner was born Violet Fults in [[Red Bud, Illinois]], the daughter of Alonzo Fults, of German and Irish descent, and Mary Ann "Mamie" Vogel, of German descent. She had an older sister, Imelda. Her father died in 1906&lt;ref&gt;''Missouri, Death Records, 1850-1931''&lt;/ref&gt; and her mother worked as a waitress.&lt;ref name="pass"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''1910 United States Federal Census''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chicago Cardinals==
Her [[1947 Chicago Cardinals season|first season]] as owner saw the Cardinals, led by the "[[Million Dollar Backfield (Chicago Cardinals)|Dream Backfield]]" of [[Paul Christman]], [[Pat Harder]], [[Marshall Goldberg]], and [[Charley Trippi]], defeat the [[1947 Philadelphia Eagles season|Philadelphia Eagles]] for the franchise's first undisputed [[1947 NFL Championship Game|league championship]]. They made it to the league title game again in [[1948 Chicago Cardinals season|1948]], but lost to the Eagles in a [[1948 NFL Championship Game|rematch]] in the snow. The Cardinals had only four more .500 seasons under her ownership.

===Move to St. Louis===
Violet married [[St. Louis]] businessman Walter H.S. Wolfner (1898–1971) in 1949,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.leagle.com/decision/196312144IllApp2d77_1111/IN_RE_ESTATE_OF_WOLFNER |title=In Re Estate of Wolfner |website=Leagle.com |date=October 15, 1963 |access-date=February 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; becoming known as Violet Bidwill Wolfner. When it became apparent that Chicago wasn't big enough for both the Cardinals and the cross-town [[Chicago Bears|Bears]] of [[George Halas]], the Wolfners moved the team to St. Louis after the [[1959 Chicago Cardinals season|1959]] season.

==Death==
She died in a physician's office in [[Miami Beach, Florida]], on January 29, 1962,&lt;ref name=mwcodcdt/&gt;&lt;ref name=mwdifl&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=4G5QAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=qBAEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4676%2C4398128 |newspaper=Milwaukee Sentinel |agency=Associated Press |title=Mrs. Wolfner dies in Florida of heart attack |date=January 30, 1962 |page=2, part 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is buried at [[Queen of Heaven Cemetery]] in [[Hillside, Illinois]].

'''WinShape Foundation''' is an [[United States|American]] [[charitable organization]] founded in 1984 by [[Truett Cathy]], founder of [[fast-food]] [[restaurant chain]] [[Chick-fil-A]], and his wife Jeanette Cathy.  WinShape's sister foundation, [[Lifeshape]], was started by the Cathy's daughter and her husband, Trudy and John White.

==Origins==
After its 1983 school year, [[Berry College]] (1902–present) closed its affiliated middle and high school operations at their financially struggling Berry Academy, forming the WinShape Foundation in 1984.  As a separate non-profit [[Private foundation (United States)|foundation]] WinShape focused on a small [[college]] [[scholarship]] program housed in the former Berry Academy buildings. Subsequently a boys and girls [[summer camp]] were each added and foundation programs expanded to include [[foster home]]s, a challenge/ropes course, corporate and marriage retreats, and United States as well as global mission trips.

== Programs ==
In 2007, the Foundation spent $18 million&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Parker|first=Star|title=Values of people like Chick-fil-A founder could help rebuild America|url= http://www.deseretnews.com/article/705263183/Values-of-people-like-Chick-fil-A-founder-could-help-rebuild-America.html |accessdate=July 20, 2012|newspaper=Deseret News|date=November 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the projects it supports, which include college scholarships, a network of foster homes and camps, and  programs for marriage counseling.

=== Scholarships ===
[[File:Mary Hall at Berry College.jpg|thumb|Mary Hall at Berry College]]
The WinShape scholarship currently provides students at Berry College $8,000 yearly – funded jointly by WinShape and Berry College. These funds replace the first $8,000 of any academic scholarships offered by the college and require a special application and interview process. The program originated with only several dozen students and offered a total of $10,000 over four years. Today, WinShape currently has over 400 college students enrolled per year, with over 800 [[alumni]] in just over 20 years.

The requirement details of the scholarship program have varied since its inception. Eligibility originally required current Chick-fil-A employment, high achievement and community involvement in high school, and a willingness to sign a contract including [[Christianity]]-based rules. Employment by Chick-fil-A is no longer a requirement, but the Christian-based nature of WinShape is perhaps stronger today than ever; the current contract specifies weekly meeting attendance, leadership discussion group participation, community service, and a Fundamentalist [[Christian]] lifestyle, including abstaining from alcohol and drugs. Beginning in 2006, [[First year|freshmen]] and transfer students were required to attend a week-long orientation camp known as FreshThing.

As of 2009, the foundation had awarded 951 Berry College scholarships with a maximum of $32,000 per student.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=88-Year-Old Chick-fil-A Founder Reaches $25 Million Scholarship Milestone|url= https://atlanta.daybooknetwork.com/story/2009-08-22/23636-truett-cathy-honored-release/ |publisher=Atlanta Daybook|accessdate=July 20, 2012|date=August 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The foundation has awarded scholarships up to $32,000 to nearly 820 students of [[Berry College]].&lt;ref name="SimonPrize"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philanthropyroundtable.org/content.asp?contentid=612|title=2008 Simon Prize Recipient|work= [[Philanthropy Roundtable]] |accessdate= December 21, 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927112152/http://www.philanthropyroundtable.org/content.asp?contentid=612|archivedate=September 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FOP"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.facesofphilanthropy.com/samuel-truett-cathy-philanthropy |title=Samuel Truett Cathy Philanthropy|accessdate=September 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Residential camps ===
[[File:Fordgarden.JPG|thumb|The Ford Buildings]]
After inception of the College Program in 1984, and wanting its campus to be used also during summer months, Cathy co-founded a summer camp (1985) for boys and girls (1987) on the Mountain Campus of Berry College (Mt. Berry)&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = It’s Easier to Succeed Than to Fail | first = S. Truett | last = Cathy | pages = 176–77}}.&lt;/ref&gt; with Rick Johnson who had previously worked at North Carolina's Camp Ridgecrest, where Cathy's children had earlier attended.  Modeled after Ridgcrest, the new camp was designed as a sports camp with a Christian emphasis using Native American themes to structure achievement.  Age groups are organized into "tribes." The boys' camp tribes include Apache (rising 2nd–4th grade), Shawnee (rising 5th–6th grade), Choctaw (rising 7th–8th grade), Navajo (rising 9th–12th grade), and Sioux (the adventure program, rising 10th–12th grade). The girls' camp tribes include Chippewa (rising 2nd–4th grade), Chickasaw (rising 5th–6th grade), Cheyenne (rising 7th–8th grade), Cherokee (rising 9th–10th grade), Catawba (rising 11th–12th grade), and Creek (the adventure program, rising 12th grade). Campers also can be awarded for Christian character and leadership. Those selected complete a challenge. The challenge consists of Scripture memorization, a run, starting a fire, building a lean-to, serving around camp, writing an essay, and completing a talking ban. At Boy's Camp, those selected who do not complete the challenge are called "Bucks," and those who do complete the challenge are called "Little Chiefs." At Girl's Camp, those selected are called "Comanches." Comanches who complete the challenge are called "Black Comanches," and those who do not complete the challenge are called "White Comanches."

In 2011, WinShape began a one-week girls camp at Young Harris College in Young Harris, Georgia. This camp consists of three clubs: Skocean, Bumbline, and Royalum. The camp is divided into junior camp (rising 2nd-6th grade) and senior camp (rising 7th-9th grade).

In 2015, WinShape began a one-week boys camp at Truett-McConnell College. This camp consists of three squads: Blaze, Hydro, and Quake.

In 2016, WinShape began a one-week high school girls camp at Cohutta Springs. This camp consists of four legacies: Oak, Aspen, Willow, and Spruce.

=== Camps for Communities ===
As well as hosting overnight camps, Winshape also travels to churches and other sites to give a 1 week Day Camp for grades 1-9. Campers are separated into Ocean (1st and 2nd Grade), Safari (3rd and 4th Grade), Alpine (5th and 6th Grade), and Galaxy (7th, 8th, and 9th Grade).

The Ocean, Safari, and Alpine Groups can choose 3 skills from 22 options (2 of which are exclusive for Alpine Campers). Along with the skills throughout the day, campers also go to 2 small group worship sessions, 3 worship/activity sessions and a competition called Connectration where they compete all week to earn tokens which can earn them a head start in Triangulation. Finally on Chick-fil-a Friday Family Fun Day, they go for half a day to worship, play triangulation, and eat chick-fil-a (provided by Chick-fil-as in that area).

Galaxy Campers (new for 2016) get to enjoy a more mature experience that goes deeper into faith without losing the fun. They go to 1 of the 3 worship/activity sessions in the morning called Wake Up! Where they have about 3 minutes to tell the younger campers what they will do that day. They also participate in the games that the younger campers play in to win tokens. The Galaxy Campers donate any tokens they receive to the younger group of their choice. Then they go to a number of activities including Main Events, Life Skills, Options (where they can choose from one of two skills and get a mini course of the skill), and a more mature worship session that goes deeper in their faith along with gender specific small groups and worship stations. Finally on Chick-fil-a Friday Family Fun Day, Galaxy has a similar day to the younger campers. During Triangulation, Galaxy is drafted into the three younger groups to help them win.

In 2017, WinShape Camps for Communities at Cobb is being launched. At Mt. Bethel UMC North Campus, WinShape will operate several sessions of a one-week day camp program that will remain at Mt. Bethel North the entire summer.

=== International camps ===
After 25 years of sponsoring camp programs in the United States, in 2009 WinShape Camps started Camp in Brasília, Brazil. In 2010, WinShape Camps went back to Brazil to do week-long day camps around the capital city.

=== WinShape Homes ===
[[S. Truett Cathy]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = It’s Better to Build Boys Than Mend Men | first = S. Truett | last = Cathy | year = 2004}}.&lt;/ref&gt; began a foster home in 1987 near the WinShape Centre on Berry College’s campus.  It was designed to provide a home for up to twelve children with full-time parents to take care of them.  To date, WinShape operates 13 homes for children who are simply victims of circumstance. There are 9 homes in Georgia, 3 in Tennessee, and one in Alabama. A Transitional Living Home has also been opened outside of Rome, Georgia to help young adults, from the program, transition successfully from high school to independence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McCaskill|first=Mary Grace|title=Chick-fil-A founder helps nurture children in foster care| journal=[[Southern Living]]|date=October 6, 2002| publisher = High beam | url = http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-92632520.html | accessdate =August 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bernstein|first=Charles|title=Father figure: Chick-fil-A’s Truett Cathy helps shape young lives|journal=[[Chain Leader]]|date=February 1, 2003 | publisher = High beam | url= http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-97872468.html | accessdate =August 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Retreat center ===
[[File:000000000 WinShape.jpg|thumb|left|Retreat Center, Rome, Georgia]]
WinShape Center is located near the hilltop campus of Berry College and more specifically at the adjacent former middle and high school campus of the Berry Academy. Once owned by Martha Berry, the site had once been home to a dairy farm with buildings originally constructed in the [[Architecture of Normandy|architectural style of Normandy, France]].  After founding WinShape, the academy buildings were remodeled and new buildings were added to create the resort.  The new retreat center hosts meetings and fund raising events, with over 8000 guests annually.  Donald (a.k.a. Bubba) and Cindy Cathy conduct marriage counseling programs at the center, aimed at those with healthy marriages to those actively considering divorce.

=== WinShape Teams ===
Started in 1991, WinShape Teams uses various techniques such as field games and ropes courses to encourage team-building and help organizations and groups work through issues and experience an improved sense of community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = About | url = http://www.winshape.org/wilderness/about/|publisher=WinShape Wilderness|accessdate=July 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== WinShape International ===
WinShape International is an organization that inspires [[Chick-fil-A]] operators and other leaders in the Chick-fil-A community to support leadership programs for young people globally.  WinShape International uses Chick-fil-A’s SERVE model of leadership as a platform to help train young people to become servant-focused leaders.{{Citation needed |date=August 2015}}

==Anti-gay donations==
Since 2003, WinShape has donated over $5 million to allegedly [[LGBT rights opposition|anti-gay]] groups,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Matters|first=Equality|title=Chick-Fil-A Donated| publisher = Equality matters | url=http://equalitymatters.org/factcheck/201207020001}}&lt;/ref&gt; including [[Eagle Forum]], [[Focus on the Family]], [[Fellowship of Christian Athletes]], [[Family Research Council]], [[Exodus International]], and the Marriage &amp; Family Legacy Fund, groups which seek to provide, among other works, an anti-gay interpretation of biblical teachings about marriage and sexuality.  Approximately $2 million was given in 2009&lt;ref name = "allbusiness"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.allbusiness.com/franchising/16713835-1.html|title=Chick-fil-A Increases Donations to Anti-Gay Groups|first1=Tim|last1=Devaney|first2=Tom|last2=Stein|work=[[AllBusiness.com]]|date=November 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "SaltLakeTribune"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/sports/52888536-78/gay-chick-family-fil.html.csp|title=Sugar House protesters say Chick-fil-A is anti-gay|first=Rosemary|last=Winters|date=November 10, 2011|work=[[The Salt Lake Tribune]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HuffPost"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/11/01/chick-fil-a-donated-anti-gay-groups-2009_n_1069429.html|title=Chick-Fil-A Fast Food Chain Donated Nearly $2 Million To Anti-Gay Groups In 2009| date= November 1, 2011 | work = [[The Huffington Post]]|first=Noah|last=Michelson}}&lt;/ref&gt; and almost the same amount in 2010.&lt;ref name = "Insider"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/heres-how-much-money-chick-fil-a-gives-to-anti-gay-groups-2012-7| title= Here’s How Much Money Chick-fil-A Gives To Anti-Gay Groups|first1=Jim|last1=Edwards|work=[[Business Insider]]|date=July 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Post"&gt;{{cite news|title=Chick-Fil-A's Anti-Gay Donations Totaled Nearly $2 Million In 2010: Report|url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/07/02/chick-fil-a-anti-gay-group-donations-_n_1644609.html | work =The Huffington Post|accessdate=July 5, 2012|first=Curtis|last=Wong|date=July 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  WinShape's financial support of these groups has caused gay-rights advocates to denounce&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | contribution-url = http://www.splcenter.org/get-informed/hate-map | title = Get informed | contribution = Hate map | publisher = SPL center}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://tpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com/2010/11/family-research-council-labeled-hate-group-by-splc-over-anti-gay-rhetoric.php | title = Family research council labeled ‘hate group’ by SPLC over ‘anti-gay rhetoric’ | date = Nov 2010 | publisher = Talking points memo}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Chick-fil-A and protest against its restaurants and products on various college and university campuses including [[Northeastern University]] and [[New York University|NYU]].

'''Working class education''' is the [[education]] of [[working-class]] people.

==History==
Prior to the 19th century, education for most members of society was [[elementary education|elementary]] and only an [[elite]] received advanced education.  This was intended to provide members of each social class with an education befitting their expected future status—toil or leadership.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kkIeyCEedrsC&amp;pg=PA221 |title=Encyclopedia of social history |author=Peter N. Stearns |chapter=Education}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Children of the [[working class]] have a different educational experience than children of the middle and upper [[Social class|classes]].  Because of this, working class children can start out life at a disadvantage.  Their educational experience may be hindered for several reasons, including influences from their parents, the schools they attend, and their expectations and attitudes, all of which are strongly affected by previous generations

==Schools==
The schools in the lower income districts are characterized by overcrowding and lack of resources.  This is because the funding of American [[Public school (government funded)|public schools]] comes mostly from their district's [[property taxes]].&lt;ref name="Shipler"/&gt; [[Residential segregation]] occurs when people segregate themselves based on [[Social class|class]] and [[race (classification of human beings)|race]].  This leaves schools in the low income school districts with little because those who are capable of paying higher property taxes move to districts where there are higher taxes and schools are receiving more.&lt;ref name="Shipler"/&gt; For example, in [[New York City]], where efforts are being made to level the playing field, students in the wealthiest school districts are given almost twice as much as students in the poorest district, an annual amount of $13,974 compared to $7,457.&lt;ref name="Shipler"/&gt; When schools lack funding, programs such as special education classes and [[extracurricular activities]] are cut back. This causes some working class children to not get the attention and help they require.  When schools and teachers are not receiving the goods required to fulfill their duty, students cannot be expected to display the motivation to learn in a flawed system.&lt;ref name="Lareau"/&gt;

==Parental influences==
The way parents act in the home and raise their children has a large effect on how children will interact in social institutions.  Many social scientists claim that [[middle class]] parents practice [[concerted cultivation]], meaning a child's life is filled with organized activities and social interactions with adults.  Due to the extent of their interactions outside of the home, the children of concerted cultivation develop a greater mastery of language and are instilled with a sense of entitlement, both of which allows them to become more comfortable when interacting with institutions.&lt;ref name="Lareau"&gt;Lareau, Annette. Unequal Childhoods. Berkeley: University of California Press, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;  On the other hand, many working class parents practice the accomplishment of natural growth, where children have more control over their free time and are exposed to fewer interactions with adults that are outside of the home.&lt;ref name="Lareau"/&gt; These children are usually left to occupy themselves with activities such as watching TV, playing video games, or playing outside. Working-class parents put less emphasis on planned activities, than their middle class counterparts, because they are less likely to have the funds to pay for them.&lt;ref name="Doob"&gt;Doob, Christopher Bates. "Working-Class Development." Social Inequality and Social Stratification in US Society. Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson, 2013. N. pag. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

The problem that comes with these differences in [[parenting practices]] is that schools, along with other institutions, are more harmonious with concerted cultivation, the parenting practice of the [[middle class]].&lt;ref name="Lareau"/&gt; Teachers want parents and children to engage and be proactive, but parents and children of the working class feel a sense of constraint that leaves them confused on how to "[[work the system]]" and often causes them to become hostile towards schooling.&lt;ref name="Russo"&gt;Russo, John and Sherry Linkon. New Working-Class Studies. Ithaca: ILR Press, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Because working class parents are often uncomfortable around authority figures, they are less likely to communicate with their child's teacher or become involved in the school.  As a result of this, low income school districts have lower involvement in parent teacher conferences.&lt;ref name="Shipler"&gt;Shipler, David. The Working Poor. New York: Knopf, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; This could also be attributed to the fact that working class parents often have to hold down more than one job and do not have very much time to help their children with homework or attend school functions. As a consequence, working-class children mature in narrow social settings, receive fewer resources, and feel less entitlement.&lt;ref name="Doob"/&gt;

==Attitudes==
The children of the working class approach school with a different attitude than those of higher class.  This is because their [[non-possession#Sense of Entitlement|sense of entitlement]] is lower than that of their middle class counterparts. Working-class students sometimes feel unentitled or that they do not belong in affluent high schools or colleges.&lt;ref name="Doob"/&gt;  Instead of viewing [[education]] as a way up in the world, the working class views it as valuable but not as a reality for them.&lt;ref name="Payne"&gt;Payne, Ruby. Framework for Understanding Poverty. Highlands, TX: Aha Process Inc, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; For working class parents, they are more consumed with the tasks of simply getting by and providing for their children than they are with good grades and higher education.  Parents pass this survival mentality onto their children and cause a cycle where working class children do not have the same aspirations instilled in them that the middle class does.  Only 54% of students whose parents only received their high school diploma go on to pursue their [[bachelor's degree]].  This statistic is compared to the 82% of students whose parents received their bachelor's degree that go on to college.&lt;ref name="Russo"/&gt; First generation students who do on go to college experience a culture shock once they get there because they are not as comfortable and sure of themselves as those that have come from a family that has received [[higher education]]. A 2012 review&lt;ref&gt;Rubin,M. (2012). [https://sites.google.com/site/markrubinsocialpsychresearch/working-class-students-are-left-out-at-university Social class differences in social integration among students in higher education: A meta-analysis and recommendations for future research.] Journal of Diversity in Higher Education, 5, 22-38. doi: 10.1037/a0026162&lt;/ref&gt; of the literature has shown that working-class students have a greater risk of being excluded from social life at universities, including formal activities such as campus-based clubs, societies, and organizations and informal activities such as parties and nonclassroom conversations. This is an important problem because social integration predicts student retention, and working class students are twice as likely as middle class students to drop out before their second year of college because they lack the persistence they need to face challenges and succeed in college.&lt;ref name="Russo"/&gt;

The attitude of children born into the working class strongly reflects the way their parents raise them. The outlook and importance of education is not the same as families with wealth. [[Inheritance]] plays a strong role in the way parents and children view and value education.

==Solving the problem==
There are some ways that this may be changed.  In order to break this cycle, working class students might be taught the values of the middle class or the schooling system develop programs that help those students that are not receiving the support and guidance they need from home.  The middle class values are the same values that are felt by the authority figures at school; therefore, through teaching working class students to value education and be more involved they will be able to navigate [[social institutions]] with greater purpose and poise.&lt;ref name="Payne"/&gt; The problem could be that working class parents did not have these values instilled in them; therefore, they are less likely to pass these values on to their children.  Schools have been left with the responsibility of being the only places for some children to learn the rules and values that are present in most institutions.&lt;ref name="Payne"/&gt;

Solving the problem of racism within these institutions, causing perpetual problems and nearly impossible change, would take large steps towards rectifying problems within the education system. As long as [[institutionalized racism]] exists, problems within the educational system will continue to exist.

Due to the lack of resources in needy schools, educational facilities are forced to develop support systems that do not have any additional costs.  Programs that have been introduced into lower income schools include the following:&lt;ref name="Payne"/&gt;

* A specified amount of time set aside everyday for homework can help the child better understand.  Often working class parents have neither the time nor the knowledge to help their children with their homework.  By providing time for homework during the school day, students who are not receiving the help they need at home are able to receive supplemental instruction.
* Keeping the same teachers for a few years or having separate schools within schools can strengthen relationships.  This program allows children and parents to become more familiar with teachers and to form stronger bonds.  By strengthening the student and teacher relationship, students are able to receive more guidance from their teachers and grow more comfortable, which may be a lacking opportunity in the home.
* The setting of daily goals can help children learn how to face challenges and deadlines.  By setting the goals in writing at the beginning of every day or week, children learn how to manage and prioritize tasks in order to feel a sense of achievement when the goals are met.
