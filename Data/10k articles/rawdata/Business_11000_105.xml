'''Aarón Sáenz Garza''' (1 June 1891 &amp;ndash; 26 February 1983) was a Mexican politician.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=wThaAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=Aarón+Sáenz+Garza+1983&amp;dq=Aarón+Sáenz+Garza+1983&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiP4IuoutvXAhWE2KQKHRObBgYQ6AEIMDAC Profile of Aarón Sáenz Garza]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
He was born in [[Monterrey]], [[Nuevo León]].

Sáenz Garza served as [[Secretary of Foreign Affairs (Mexico)|Secretary of Foreign Affairs]] during Calles' time as president. During his tenure, he continuously defended the Calles Administration's decision to cut oil to the United States when US Secretary of State Frank Kellog tried to bargain for a deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,722820,00.html |title=MEXICO: Vexful Waiting |work=Time |date=1926-12-06 |accessdate=2013-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,846094,00.html |title=Foreign News: Secrets |work=Time |date=1927-03-14 |accessdate=2013-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; He soon became [[Governor of Nuevo León]] and maintained close ties with Calles; as governor, he even sat with Calles when he questioned the assassin of President-elect Alvaro Obregon in 1928.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,786965,00.html |title=MEXICO: Must keep calm! |work=Time |date=1928-07-30 |accessdate=2013-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was also announced that Calles had plans to nominate him as the Chairman of the National Revolutionary Party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,928342-2,00.html |title=MEXICO: New President |work=Time |date=1928-12-10 |accessdate=2013-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[President of Mexico|President]] [[Pascual Ortiz Rubio]] appointed him [[Secretary of Education (Mexico)|Secretary of Public Education]] on February 1930.  By 1934, Saenz had been dubbed as the "Shadow of Calles" and was named Governor of Mexico's Federal District by Mexican President [[Lázaro Cárdenas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,748144,00.html |title=MEXICO: Palm Down |work=Time |date=1934-12-10 |accessdate=2013-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cardenas and the Mexican Congress, however, soon turned on both Calles and Saenz and condemned their continued persecution against Catholics in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,788523-2,00.html |title=MEXICO: Ossy, Ossy, Boneheads |work=Time |date=1935-02-04 |accessdate=2013-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After leaving office in 1935, Saenz established a sugar corporation and quickly revolutionized sugar production in the country.&lt;ref&gt;Aarón Sáenz; Mexico's revolutionary capitalist, James C. Hefley, pg. 93&lt;/ref&gt; He was also known as the "king of Mexican sugar", founding a dynasty which survives until this date, led by his son Aaron Saenz Couret and grandson Aaron Saenz Hirschfeld, at the head of the leading sugar company in Mexico.  At one point, he held a virtual monopoly of Mexico's sugar industry.&lt;ref name=ipm&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,858259-5,00.html |title=MEXICO: The Domino Player |work=Time |date=1953-09-14 |accessdate=2013-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His monopoly, however, was brought down during the administration of Mexican president [[Adolfo Ruiz Cortines]] by 1953.&lt;ref name=ipm /&gt;
Saenz was married to Margarita Couret, with whom he had eight sons. 

He died on 26 February 1983.

==Businesses==
For some time they all managed varied branches of the family's businesses, most of which have ceased to exist or passed into others' ownership. 
Most notable among these were:

*[[Mexicana de Aviación]] (Now bankrupt)
*Sugar mills
*Seguros Atlas—merged with Seguros Comercial America in the 90's and afterwards sold to France's [[AXA]]
*Banca Confía—nationalized in 1982, only to be re privatized by [[Carlos Salinas de Gortari]]'s administration and passing into the hands of [[Jorge Lankenau]]'s insurance group, later to be merged with [[Grupo Financiero Banamex|Banamex]] and acquired by [[Citibank]] during President [[Ernesto Zedillo]]'s administration.

==Legacy==
Aarón Sáenz was related to [[Raul Saenz]], a prominent Mexican businessman in [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]] state, as well as [[Moises Saenz]], a prominent Mexican educator and diplomat.

'''Adam Smith''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|FRSA}} ({{OldStyleDateNY|16 June|5 June}} 1723&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/smith_adam.shtml|title=Adam Smith (1723-1790)|website=BBC|quote=Adam Smith's exact date of birth is unknown, but he was baptised on 5 June 1723.}}&lt;/ref&gt; – 17 July 1790) was a Scottish [[economist]], [[philosopher]] and [[author]] as well as a [[Ethics|moral philosopher]], a pioneer of [[political economy]] and a key figure during the [[Scottish Enlightenment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Great Thinkers of the Scottish Enlightenment|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/scottishhistory/enlightenment/features_enlightenment_enlightenment.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smith is best known for two classic works, ''[[The Theory of Moral Sentiments]]'' (1759) and ''[[The Wealth of Nations|An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations]]'' (1776). The latter, often abbreviated as ''The Wealth of Nations'', is considered his ''[[Masterpiece|magnum opus]]'' and the first modern work of economics.

Smith studied [[social philosophy]] at the [[University of Glasgow]] and at [[Balliol College, Oxford]], where he was one of the first students to benefit from scholarships set up by fellow Scot [[John Snell]]. After graduating, he delivered a successful series of public lectures at [[Edinburgh]], leading him to collaborate with [[David Hume]] during the Scottish Enlightenment. Smith obtained a professorship at Glasgow, teaching moral philosophy and during this time, wrote and published ''The Theory of Moral Sentiments''. In his later life, he took a tutoring position that allowed him to travel throughout Europe, where he met other intellectual leaders of his day.

Smith laid the foundations of classical [[free market]] economic theory. ''The Wealth of Nations'' was a precursor to the modern academic discipline of economics. In this and other works, he developed the concept of [[Division of labour#Adam Smith|division of labour]] and expounded upon how rational self-interest and competition can lead to economic prosperity. Smith was controversial in his own day and his general approach and writing style were often satirised by [[Tories (British political party)|Tory]] writers in the moralising tradition of [[William Hogarth]] and [[Jonathan Swift]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} In 2005, ''The Wealth of Nations'' was named among the 100 best Scottish books of all time.&lt;ref name="100 Best Scottish Books, Adam Smith"&gt;[http://www.list.co.uk/articles/100-best-scottish-books/adam-smith/ "100 Best Scottish Books, Adam Smith"]. Retrieved 31 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

===Early life===

Smith was born in [[Kirkcaldy]], in the County of [[Fife]], Scotland. His father, also Adam Smith, was a Scottish [[Society of Writers to Her Majesty's Signet|Writer to the Signet]] (senior [[Solicitor#Scotland|solicitor]]), [[Advocate#Scotland|advocate]] and [[Prosecutor#Scotland|prosecutor]] (judge advocate) and also served as comptroller of the customs in Kirkcaldy.&lt;ref name="rae 1895 1"&gt;{{harvnb|Rae|1895|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1720, he married Margaret Douglas, daughter of the landed Robert Douglas of Strathendry, also in Fife. His father died two months after he was born, leaving his mother a widow.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bussing-Burks|2003|pp=38–39}}&lt;/ref&gt; The date of Smith's baptism into the [[Church of Scotland]] at Kirkcaldy was &lt;!-- 5 June is OS; 5 June is NS. --&gt;5 June 1723&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Buchan|2006|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and this has often been treated as if it were also his date of birth,&lt;ref name="rae 1895 1"&gt;{{harvnb|Rae|1895|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is unknown. Although few events in Smith's early childhood are known, the Scottish journalist [[John Rae (biographer)|John Rae]], Smith's biographer, recorded that Smith was abducted by gypsies at the age of three and released when others went to rescue him.{{efn|In ''Life of Adam Smith'', Rae writes: "In his fourth year, while on a visit to his grandfather's house at Strathendry on the banks of the Leven, [Smith] was stolen by a passing band of gypsies, and for a time could not be found. But presently a gentleman arrived who had met a gypsy woman a few miles down the road carrying a child that was crying piteously. Scouts were immediately dispatched in the direction indicated, and they came upon the woman in Leslie wood. As soon as she saw them she threw her burden down and escaped, and the child was brought back to his mother. [Smith] would have made, I fear, a poor gypsy."&lt;ref name="rae 1895 5" /&gt;}} Smith was close to his mother, who probably encouraged him to pursue his scholarly ambitions.&lt;ref name="Bussing-Burks 2003 39"&gt;{{harvnb|Bussing-Burks|2003|p=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; He attended the [[Burgh School of Kirkcaldy]]—characterised by Rae as "one of the best secondary schools of Scotland at that period"&lt;ref name="rae 1895 5"&gt;{{harvnb|Rae|1895|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;—from 1729 to 1737, he learned [[Latin]], mathematics, history, and writing.&lt;ref name="Bussing-Burks 2003 39"/&gt;

===Formal education===

Smith entered the [[University of Glasgow]] when he was 14 and studied moral philosophy under [[Francis Hutcheson (philosopher)|Francis Hutcheson]].&lt;ref name="Bussing-Burks 2003 39"/&gt; Here, Smith developed his passion for [[liberty]], [[reason]], and [[free speech]]. In 1740, Smith was the graduate scholar presented to undertake postgraduate studies at [[Balliol College, Oxford]], under the [[Snell Exhibition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Buchan|2006|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Smith considered the teaching at Glasgow to be far superior to that at Oxford, which he found intellectually stifling.&lt;ref name="Bussing-Burks 2003 41"&gt;{{harvnb|Bussing-Burks|2003|p=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Book V, Chapter II of ''The Wealth of Nations'', Smith wrote: "In the University of Oxford, the greater part of the public professors have, for these many years, given up altogether even the pretence of teaching."
Smith is also reported to have complained to friends that Oxford officials once discovered him reading a copy of [[David Hume]]'s ''[[A Treatise of Human Nature]]'', and they subsequently confiscated his book and punished him severely for reading it.&lt;ref name="rae 1895 5" /&gt;&lt;ref name="rae 1895 24"&gt;{{harvnb|Rae|1895|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Buchholz 1999 12"&gt;{{harvnb|Buchholz|1999|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to William Robert Scott, "The Oxford of [Smith's] time gave little if any help towards what was to be his lifework."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Introductory Economics |publisher=New Age Publishers |isbn=81-224-1830-9 |page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Smith took the opportunity while at Oxford to teach himself several subjects by reading many books from the shelves of the large [[Bodleian Library]].&lt;ref name="rae 1895 22"&gt;{{harvnb|Rae|1895|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Smith was not studying on his own, his time at Oxford was not a happy one, according to his letters.&lt;ref name="rae 1895 24–25"&gt;{{harvnb|Rae|1895|pp=24–25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Near the end of his time there, Smith began suffering from shaking fits, probably the symptoms of a nervous breakdown.&lt;ref name="Bussing-Burks 2003 42"&gt;{{harvnb|Bussing-Burks|2003|p=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; He left Oxford University in 1746, before his scholarship ended.&lt;ref name="Bussing-Burks 2003 42" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Buchan|2006|p=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Book V of ''The Wealth of Nations'', Smith comments on the low quality of instruction and the meager intellectual activity at [[List of universities in England|English universities]], when compared to their Scottish counterparts. He attributes this both to the rich endowments of the colleges at Oxford and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]], which made the income of professors independent of their ability to attract students, and to the fact that distinguished [[Intellectual#Man of Letters|men of letters]] could make an even more comfortable living as ministers of the [[Church of England]].&lt;ref name="Buchholz 1999 12" /&gt;

Smith's discontent at Oxford might be in part due to the absence of his beloved teacher in Glasgow, Francis Hutcheson, who was well regarded as one of the most prominent lecturers at the University of Glasgow in his day and earned the approbation of students, colleagues, and even ordinary residents with the fervor and earnestness of his orations (which he sometimes opened to the public). His lectures endeavoured not merely to teach philosophy, but also to make his students embody that philosophy in their lives, appropriately acquiring the epithet, the preacher of philosophy. Unlike Smith, Hutcheson was not a system builder; rather, his magnetic personality and method of lecturing so influenced his students and caused the greatest of those to reverentially refer to him as "the never to be forgotten Hutcheson"—a title that Smith in all his correspondence used to describe only two people, his good friend David Hume and influential mentor Francis Hutcheson.&lt;ref&gt;Scott, W.&amp;nbsp;R. "The Never to Be Forgotten Hutcheson: Excerpts from W.&amp;nbsp;R. Scott," ''Econ Journal Watch 8(1):'' 96–109, January 2011.[http://econjwatch.org/articles/the-never-to-be-forgotten-hutcheson-excerpts-from-wr-scott]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Adam Smith's mother.JPG|thumb|upright=0.65|Portrait of Smith's mother, Margaret Douglas]]
===Teaching career===
Smith began delivering public lectures in 1748 in Edinburgh, sponsored by the Philosophical Society of Edinburgh under the patronage of [[Henry Home, Lord Kames|Lord Kames]].&lt;ref name="rae 1895 30"&gt;{{harvnb|Rae|1895|p=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; His lecture topics included [[rhetoric]] and ''[[belles-lettres]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Smith, A. ([1762] 1985). ''Lectures on Rhetoric and Belles Lettres'' [1762]. vol. IV of the Glasgow Edition of the ''Works and Correspondence of Adam Smith'' (Indianapolis: Liberty Fund, 1984). Retrieved 16 February 2012&lt;/ref&gt; and later the subject of "the progress of opulence". On this latter topic, he first expounded his economic philosophy of "the obvious and simple system of [[Natural and legal rights|natural liberty]]". While Smith was not adept at [[public speaking]], his lectures met with success.&lt;ref name="Bussing-Burks 2003 43"&gt;{{harvnb|Bussing-Burks|2003|p=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1750, Smith met the philosopher David Hume, who was his senior by more than a decade. In their writings covering history, politics, philosophy, economics, and religion, Smith and Hume shared closer intellectual and personal bonds than with other important figures of the Scottish Enlightenment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Smith, Adam (bap. 1723, d. 1790) |encyclopedia=[[Dictionary of National Biography]] |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |date=September 2004 |author=Winch, Donald}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1751, Smith earned a professorship at Glasgow University teaching [[logic]] courses, and in 1752, he was elected a member of the Philosophical Society of Edinburgh, having been introduced to the society by Lord Kames. When the [[Professor of Moral Philosophy (Glasgow)|head of Moral Philosophy in Glasgow]] died the next year, Smith took over the position.&lt;ref name="Bussing-Burks 2003 43" /&gt; He worked as an academic for the next 13 years, which he characterised as "by far the most useful and therefore by far the happiest and most honorable period [of his life]".&lt;ref name="rae 1895 42"&gt;{{harvnb|Rae|1895|p=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Smith published ''[[The Theory of Moral Sentiments]]'' in 1759, embodying some of his Glasgow lectures. This work was concerned with how human morality depends on sympathy between agent and spectator, or the individual and other members of society. Smith defined "mutual sympathy" as the basis of [[Moral sense theory|moral sentiments]]. He based his explanation, not on a special "moral sense" as the [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 3rd Earl of Shaftesbury|Third Lord Shaftesbury]] and Hutcheson had done, nor on [[utilitarianism|utility]] as Hume did, but on mutual sympathy, a term best captured in modern parlance by the 20th-century concept of [[empathy]], the capacity to recognise feelings that are being experienced by another being.

Following the publication of ''The Theory of Moral Sentiments'', Smith became so popular that many wealthy students left their schools in other countries to enroll at Glasgow to learn under Smith.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Buchholz|1999|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the publication of ''The Theory of Moral Sentiments'', Smith began to give more attention to [[jurisprudence]] and economics in his lectures and less to his theories of morals.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Buchan|2006|p=67}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Smith lectured that the cause of increase in national wealth is labour, rather than the nation's quantity of gold or silver, which is the basis for [[mercantilism]], the [[economic theory]] that dominated Western European economic policies at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Buchholz|1999|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1762, the University of Glasgow conferred on Smith the title of [[Doctor of Law]]s (LL.D.).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gla.ac.uk/myglasgow/archives/exhibitions/smith/photogallery/honorarydegree/|title=MyGlasgow - Archive Services - Exhibitions - Adam Smith in Glasgow - Photo Gallery - Honorary degree|website=University of Glasgow|accessdate=November 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of 1763, he obtained an offer from [[Charles Townshend]]—who had been introduced to Smith by David Hume—to tutor his stepson, [[Henry Scott, 3rd Duke of Buccleuch|Henry Scott]], the young Duke of Buccleuch. Smith resigned from his professorship in 1764 to take the tutoring position. He subsequently attempted to return the fees he had collected from his students because he had resigned partway through the term, but his students refused.&lt;ref name="Buchholz 1999 16"&gt;{{harvnb|Buchholz|1999|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tutoring and travels===
Smith's tutoring job entailed touring Europe with Scott, during which time he educated Scott on a variety of subjects, such as etiquette and manners. He was paid [[Pound sterling|£]]300 per year (plus expenses) along with a £300 per year pension; roughly twice his former income as a teacher.&lt;ref name="Buchholz 1999 16" /&gt; Smith first travelled as a tutor to [[Toulouse]], France, where he stayed for a year and a half. According to his own account, he found Toulouse to be somewhat boring, having written to Hume that he "had begun to write a book to pass away the time".&lt;ref name="Buchholz 1999 16" /&gt; After touring the south of France, the group moved to [[Geneva]], where Smith met with the philosopher [[Voltaire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Buchholz|1999|pp=16–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Allan Ramsay - David Hume, 1711 - 1776. Historian and philosopher - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright|[[David Hume]] was a friend and contemporary of Smith's.|alt=A man posing for a painting]]
From Geneva, the party moved to Paris. Here, Smith met [[Benjamin Franklin]], and discovered the [[Physiocracy]] school founded by [[François Quesnay]].&lt;ref name="Buchholz 17"&gt;{{harvnb|Buchholz|1999|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Physiocrats were opposed to [[mercantilism]], the dominating economic theory of the time, illustrated in their motto ''[[Laissez-faire|Laissez faire et laissez passer, le monde va de lui même!]]'' (Let do and let pass, the world goes on by itself!).

The wealth of France had been virtually depleted by [[Louis XIV of France|Louis&amp;nbsp;XIV]]{{efn|During the reign of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis&amp;nbsp;XIV]], the population shrunk by 4 million and agricultural productivity was reduced by one-third while the taxes had increased.

The excessive consumption of goods and services deemed to have no economic contribution was considered a source of unproductive labour, with France's agriculture the only economic sector maintaining the wealth of the nation.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} Given that the English economy of the day yielded an income distribution that stood in contrast to that which existed in France, Smith concluded that "with all its imperfections, [the Physiocratic school] is perhaps the nearest approximation to the truth that has yet been published upon the subject of political economy."&lt;ref&gt;Smith, A., 1976, ''The Wealth of Nations'' edited by R.&amp;nbsp;H. Campbell and A.&amp;nbsp;S. Skinner, The Glasgow edition of the Works and Correspondence of Adam Smith, vol. 2b, p. 678.&lt;/ref&gt; The distinction between productive versus unproductive labour—the physiocratic ''classe steril''—was a predominant issue in the development and understanding of what would become classical economic theory.

===Later years===
In 1766, Henry Scott's younger brother died in Paris, and Smith's tour as a tutor ended shortly thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Buchholz|1999|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smith returned home that year to Kirkcaldy, and he devoted much of the next decade to writing his ''magnum opus''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Buchan|2006|p=90}}&lt;/ref&gt; There, he befriended [[Henry Moyes]], a young blind man who showed precocious aptitude.  Smith secured the patronage of David Hume and [[Thomas Reid]] in the young man's education.&lt;ref&gt;''Dr [[James Currie (physician)|James Currie]] to [[Thomas Creevey]]'', 24 February 1793, Lpool RO, Currie MS 920 CUR&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1773, Smith was elected fellow of the [[Royal Society of London]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Buchan|2006|p=89}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was elected a member of the [[The Club (dining club)|Literary Club]] in 1775. ''The Wealth of Nations'' was published in 1776 and was an instant success, selling out its first edition in only six months.&lt;ref name="Buchholz 19"&gt;{{harvnb|Buchholz|1999|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1778, Smith was appointed to a post as commissioner of customs in Scotland and went to live with his mother (who died in 1784)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Durant|first1=Will|last2=Durant|first2=Ariel|title=The Story of Civilization: Rousseau and Revolution|date=1 July 1967|publisher=MJF Books|ISBN=1567310214}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Panmure House (Edinburgh)|Panmure House]] in Edinburgh's [[Canongate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Buchan|2006|p=128}}&lt;/ref&gt; Five years later, as a member of the Philosophical Society of Edinburgh when it received its royal charter, he automatically became one of the founding members of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Buchan|2006|p=133}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1787 to 1789, he occupied the honorary position of Lord [[Rector of the University of Glasgow]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Buchan|2006|p=137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death===
[[File:Kirkcaldy High Street Adam Smith Plaque.png|thumb|upright|right|A commemorative plaque for Smith is located in Smith's home town of [[Kirkcaldy]].|alt=A plaque of Smith]]
Smith died in the northern wing of Panmure House in Edinburgh on 17 July 1790 after a painful illness. His body was buried in the [[Canongate Kirkyard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Buchan|2006|p=145}}&lt;/ref&gt; On his deathbed, Smith expressed disappointment that he had not achieved more.&lt;ref name="Bussing-Burks 2003 53"&gt;{{harvnb|Bussing-Burks|2003|p=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Smith's literary executors were two friends from the Scottish academic world: the physicist and chemist [[Joseph Black]] and the pioneering geologist [[James Hutton]].&lt;ref name="buchan 2006 25"&gt;{{harvnb|Buchan|2006|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smith left behind many notes and some unpublished material, but gave instructions to destroy anything that was not fit for publication.&lt;ref name="buchan 2006 88"&gt;{{harvnb|Buchan|2006|p=88}}&lt;/ref&gt; He mentioned an early unpublished ''History of Astronomy'' as probably suitable, and it duly appeared in 1795, along with other material such as ''[[Essays on Philosophical Subjects]]''.&lt;ref name="buchan 2006 25"/&gt;

Smith's library went by his will to [[David Douglas, Lord Reston]] (son of his cousin Colonel Robert Douglas of Strathendry, Fife), who lived with Smith.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |chapter= Adam Smith's Will |title=A Catalogue of the Library of Adam Smith |editor=Bonar, James |editor-link= James Bonar (civil servant) |publisher=Macmillan |location=London |year=1894 |pages= XIV |oclc=2320634 |url=https://archive.org/stream/catalogueoflibr00smit#page/n19/mode/2up |ref=harv |via=Internet Archive}|accessdate= 13 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was eventually divided between his two surviving children, Cecilia Margaret (Mrs.&amp;nbsp;Cunningham) and David Anne (Mrs.&amp;nbsp;Bannerman). On the death of her husband, the Reverend W.&amp;nbsp;B. Cunningham of Prestonpans in 1878, Mrs.&amp;nbsp;Cunningham sold some of the books. The remainder passed to her son, Professor [[Robert Oliver Cunningham]] of Queen's College, Belfast, who presented a part to the library of Queen's College. After his death, the remaining books were sold. On the death of Mrs. Bannerman in 1879, her portion of the library went intact to the New College (of the Free Church) in Edinburgh and the collection was transferred to the University of Edinburgh Main Library in 1972.

==Personality and beliefs==

===Character===
[[File:Smith medallion portrait.jpg|upright|thumb|[[James Tassie]]'s enamel paste medallion of Smith provided the model for many engravings and portraits that remain today.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bonar|1895|pp=xx–xxiv}}&lt;/ref&gt;|alt=An enamel paste medallion, depicting a man's head facing the right]]

Not much is known about Smith's personal views beyond what can be deduced from his published articles. His personal papers were destroyed after his death at his request.&lt;ref name="buchan 2006 88" /&gt; He never married,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Buchan|2006|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and seems to have maintained a close relationship with his mother, with whom he lived after his return from France and who died six years before him.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Buchan|2006|p=134}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Smith was described by several of his contemporaries and biographers as comically absent-minded, with peculiar habits of speech and gait, and a smile of "inexpressible benignity".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rae|1895|p=262}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was known to talk to himself,&lt;ref name="Bussing-Burks 2003 53" /&gt; a habit that began during his childhood when he would smile in rapt conversation with invisible companions.&lt;ref name="skousen 2001 32"&gt;{{harvnb|Skousen|2001|p=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also had occasional spells of imaginary illness,&lt;ref name="Bussing-Burks 2003 53" /&gt; and he is reported to have had books and papers placed in tall stacks in his study.&lt;ref name="skousen 2001 32" /&gt; According to one story, Smith took Charles Townshend on a tour of a [[Tanning (leather)|tanning]] factory, and while discussing [[free trade]], Smith walked into a huge [[Tanning (leather)|tanning pit]] from which he needed help to escape.&lt;ref name="Buchholz 14"&gt;{{harvnb|Buchholz|1999|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also said to have put bread and butter into a teapot, drunk the concoction, and declared it to be the worst cup of tea he ever had. According to another account, Smith distractedly went out walking in his nightgown and ended up {{convert|15|mi|km}} outside of town, before nearby church bells brought him back to reality.&lt;ref name="skousen 2001 32" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Buchholz 14" /&gt;

[[James Boswell]], who was a student of Smith's at Glasgow University, and later knew him at the [[The Club (Literary Club)|Literary Club]], says that Smith thought that speaking about his ideas in conversation might reduce the sale of his books, so his conversation was unimpressive. According to Boswell, he once told [[Joshua Reynolds|Sir Joshua Reynolds]], that 'he made it a rule when in company never to talk of what he understood'.&lt;ref&gt;Boswell's '[[Life of Samuel Johnson]]'', 1780.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:AdamSmith1790b.jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait of Smith by [[John Kay (caricaturist)|John Kay]], 1790|alt=A drawing of a man standing up, with one hand holding a cane and the other pointing at a book]]

Smith has been alternately described as someone who "had a large nose, bulging eyes, a protruding lower lip, a nervous twitch, and a speech impediment" and one whose "countenance was manly and agreeable."&lt;ref name="Buchholz 1999 12" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ross|2010|p=330}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smith is said to have acknowledged his looks at one point, saying, "I am a beau in nothing but my books."&lt;ref name="Buchholz 1999 12" /&gt; Smith rarely sat for portraits,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Stewart |first=Dugald |title=The Works of Adam Smith: With An Account of His Life and Writings |publisher=Henry G. Bohn |location=London |year=1853 |page=lxix |oclc=3226570 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=FbYCAAAAYAAJ |nopp=true}}&lt;/ref&gt; so almost all depictions of him created during his lifetime were drawn from memory. The best-known portraits of Smith are the profile by [[James Tassie]] and two [[etching]]s by [[John Kay (caricaturist)|John Kay]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rae|1895|pp=376–77}}&lt;/ref&gt; The line engravings produced for the covers of 19th-century reprints of ''The Wealth of Nations'' were based largely on Tassie's medallion.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bonar|1895|p=xxi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religious views===
Considerable scholarly debate has occurred about the nature of Smith's religious views. Smith's father had shown a strong interest in Christianity and belonged to the moderate wing of the [[Church of Scotland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ross|1995|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that Adam Smith received the Snell Exhibition suggests that he may have gone to Oxford with the intention of pursuing a career in the [[Church of England]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Times obituary of Adam Smith|journal=[[The Times]]|date=24 July 1790|pages=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Times/1790/Obituary/Adam_Smith}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anglo-American economist [[Ronald Coase]] has challenged the view that Smith was a deist, based on the fact that Smith's writings never explicitly invoke God as an explanation of the harmonies of the natural or the human worlds.&lt;ref name="Coase"&gt;{{harvnb|Coase|1976|pp=529–46}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Coase, though Smith does sometimes refer to the "[[Great Architect of the Universe]]", later scholars such as [[Jacob Viner]] have "very much exaggerated the extent to which Adam Smith was committed to a belief in a personal God",&lt;ref name="Coase-God"&gt;{{harvnb|Coase|1976|p=538}}&lt;/ref&gt; a belief for which Coase finds little evidence in passages such as the one in the ''Wealth of Nations'' in which Smith writes that the curiosity of mankind about the "great phenomena of nature", such as "the generation, the life, growth, and dissolution of plants and animals", has led men to "enquire into their causes", and that "superstition first attempted to satisfy this curiosity, by referring all those wonderful appearances to the immediate agency of the gods. Philosophy afterwards endeavoured to account for them, from more familiar causes, or from such as mankind were better acquainted with than the agency of the gods".&lt;ref name="Coase-God" /&gt;

Some other authors argue that Smith's social and economic philosophy is inherently theological and that his entire model of social order is logically dependent on the notion of God's action in nature.&lt;ref name="hidden theology"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Hill |first1=L. |doi=10.1080/713765225 |title=The hidden theology of Adam Smith |journal=The European Journal of the History of Economic Thought |volume=8 |pages=1–29 |year=2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Smith was also a close friend and later the executor of David Hume, who was commonly characterised in his own time as an [[atheist]].&lt;ref name="hume on religion"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hume-religion/ |title=Hume on Religion |publisher=[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] |accessdate=26 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The publication in 1777 of Smith's letter to [[William Strahan (publisher)|William Strahan]], in which he described Hume's courage in the face of death in spite of his irreligiosity, attracted considerable controversy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Eric Schliesser |year=2003 |journal=Hume Studies |volume=29 |issue=2 |pages=327–62 |title=The Obituary of a Vain Philosopher: Adam Smith's Reflections on Hume's Life |url=http://www.humesociety.org/hs/issues/v29n2/schliesser/schliesser-v29n2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Published works==

===''The Theory of Moral Sentiments''===
{{Main article|The Theory of Moral Sentiments}}
In 1759, Smith published his first work, ''The Theory of Moral Sentiments,'' sold by co-publishers [[Andrew Millar]] of London and Alexander Kincaid of Edinburgh.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.millar-project.ed.ac.uk/|title=Andrew Millar Project, University of Edinburgh|website=millar-project.ed.ac.uk|accessdate=3 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smith continued making extensive revisions to the book until his death.{{efn|The 6 editions of ''The Theory of Moral Sentiments'' were published in 1759, 1761, 1767, 1774, 1781, and 1790, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Adam Smith, Glasgow Edition of the Works and Correspondence Vol. 1 The Theory of Moral Sentiments [1759]}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Although ''The Wealth of Nations'' is widely regarded as Smith's most influential work, Smith himself  is believed to have considered ''The Theory of Moral Sentiments'' to be a superior work.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rae|1895}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the work, Smith critically examines the moral thinking of his time, and suggests that conscience arises from dynamic and interactive social relationships through which people seek "mutual sympathy of sentiments."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.liberalhistory.org.uk/item_single.php?item_id=37&amp;item=biography |title=Biography of Smith |accessdate=14 May 2008 |publisher=[[Liberal Democrat History Group]] |year=1997 |author=Falkner, Robert |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080611110312/http://www.liberalhistory.org.uk/item_single.php?item_id=37&amp;item=biography |archivedate=11 June 2008 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; His goal in writing the work was to explain the source of mankind's ability to form moral judgement, given that people begin life with no moral sentiments at all. Smith proposes a theory of sympathy, in which the act of observing others and seeing the judgements they form of both others and oneself makes people aware of themselves and how others perceive their behaviour. The feedback we receive from perceiving (or imagining) others' judgements creates an incentive to achieve "mutual sympathy of sentiments" with them and leads people to develop habits, and then principles, of behaviour, which come to constitute one's conscience.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|2002|p=xv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars have perceived a conflict between ''The Theory of Moral Sentiments'' and ''The Wealth of Nations''; the former emphasises sympathy for others, while the latter focuses on the role of self-interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Viner|1991|p=250}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, however, some scholars&lt;ref&gt;Wight, Jonathan B. ''Saving Adam Smith''. Upper Saddle River: Prentic-Hall, Inc., 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robbins, Lionel. ''A History of Economic Thought''. Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brue, Stanley L., and Randy R. Grant. ''The Evolution of Economic Thought''. Mason: Thomson Higher Education, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; of Smith's work have argued that no contradiction exists. They claim that in ''The Theory of Moral Sentiments'', Smith develops a theory of psychology in which individuals seek the approval of the "impartial spectator" as a result of a natural desire to have outside observers sympathise with their sentiments. Rather than viewing ''The Theory of Moral Sentiments'' and ''The Wealth of Nations'' as presenting incompatible views of human nature, some Smith scholars regard the works as emphasising different aspects of human nature that vary depending on the situation. [[James Otteson|Otteson]] argues that both books are Newtonian in their methodology and deploy a similar "market model" for explaining the creation and development of large-scale human social orders, including morality, economics, as well as language.&lt;ref&gt;Otteson, James R. 2002, ''Adam Smith's Marketplace of Life''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Ekelund|Ekelund]] and Hebert offer a differing view, observing that self-interest is present in both works and that "in the former, sympathy is the moral faculty that holds self-interest in check, whereas in the latter, competition is the economic faculty that restrains self-interest."&lt;ref&gt;Ekelund, R. &amp; Hebert, R. 2007, ''A History of Economic Theory and Method'' 5th Edition. Waveland Press, United States, p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Wealth of Nations''===
{{Main article|The Wealth of Nations}}

Disagreement exists between classical and neoclassical economists about the central message of Smith's most influential work: ''An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations'' (1776). Neoclassical economists emphasise Smith's [[invisible hand]],&lt;ref&gt;Smith, A., 1976, ''The Wealth of Nations'' edited by R.&amp;nbsp;H. Campbell and A.&amp;nbsp;S. Skinner, ''The Glasgow edition of the Works and Correspondence of Adam Smith'', vol. 2a, p. 456.&lt;/ref&gt; a concept mentioned in the middle of his work – Book&amp;nbsp;IV, Chapter&amp;nbsp;II – and classical economists believe that Smith stated his programme for promoting the "wealth of nations" in the first sentences, which attributes the growth of wealth and prosperity to the division of labour.

Smith used the term "[[invisible hand|the invisible hand]]" in "History of Astronomy"&lt;ref&gt;Smith, A., 1980, ''The Glasgow edition of the Works and Correspondence of Adam Smith'', vol. 3, p. 49, edited by W.&amp;nbsp;P.&amp;nbsp;D. Wightman and J.&amp;nbsp;C. Bryce, Oxford: Clarendon Press.&lt;/ref&gt; referring to "the invisible hand of Jupiter", and once in each of his ''[[The Theory of Moral Sentiments]]''&lt;ref&gt;Smith, A., 1976, ''The Glasgow edition of the Works and Correspondence of Adam Smith'', vol. 1, pp. 184–85, edited by D.&amp;nbsp;D. Raphael and A.&amp;nbsp;L. Macfie, Oxford: Clarendon Press.&lt;/ref&gt; (1759) and [[The Wealth of Nations]]&lt;ref&gt;Smith, A., 1976, ''The Glasgow edition of the Works and Correspondence of Adam Smith'', vol. 2a, p. 456, edited by R.&amp;nbsp;H. Cambell and A.&amp;nbsp;S. Skinner, Oxford: Clarendon Press.&lt;/ref&gt; (1776). This last statement about "an invisible hand" has been interpreted in numerous ways.

[[File:19th-century building at location where Adam Smith lived, 1767-1776.jpg|thumb|[[Adam Smith House|Later building on the site]] where Smith wrote ''The Wealth of Nations''|alt=A brown building]]
&lt;blockquote&gt;As every individual, therefore, endeavours as much as he can both to employ his capital in the support of domestic industry, and so to direct that industry that its produce may be of the greatest value; every individual necessarily labours to render the annual revenue of the society as great as he can. He generally, indeed, neither intends to promote the public interest, nor knows how much he is promoting it. By preferring the support of domestic to that of foreign industry, he intends only his own security; and by directing that industry in such a manner as its produce may be of the greatest value, he intends only his own gain, and he is in this, as in many other cases, led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention. Nor is it always the worse for the society that it was no part of it. By pursuing his own interest he frequently promotes that of the society more effectually than when he really intends to promote it. I have never known much good done by those who affected to trade for the public good. It is an affectation, indeed, not very common among merchants, and very few words need be employed in dissuading them from it.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Those who regard that statement as Smith's central message also quote frequently Smith's dictum:&lt;ref&gt;Smith, A., 1976, ''The Glasgow edition'', vol. 2a, pp. 26–27.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker, that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own interest. We address ourselves, not to their humanity but to their self-love, and never talk to them of our own necessities but of their advantages.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Wealth of Nations.jpg|thumb|upright|The first page of ''The Wealth of Nations'', 1776 London edition|alt=The first page of a book]]
Smith's statement about the benefits of "an invisible hand" may be meant to answer{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}} [[Bernard Mandeville|Mandeville's]] contention that "Private Vices ... may be turned into Public Benefits".&lt;ref&gt;Mandeville, B., 1724, ''The Fable of the Bees'', London: Tonson.&lt;/ref&gt; It shows Smith's belief that when an individual pursues his self-interest under conditions of justice, he unintentionally promotes the good of society. Self-interested competition in the free market, he argued, would tend to benefit society as a whole by keeping prices low, while still building in an incentive for a wide variety of goods and services. Nevertheless, he was wary of businessmen and warned of their "conspiracy against the public or in some other contrivance to raise prices".&lt;ref&gt;Smith, A., 1976, ''The Glasgow edition'', vol. 2a, pp. 145, 158.&lt;/ref&gt; Again and again, Smith warned of the collusive nature of business interests, which may form cabals or [[Monopoly|monopolies]], fixing the highest price "which can be squeezed out of the buyers".&lt;ref&gt;Smith, A., 1976, ''The Glasgow edition'', vol. 2a, p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt; Smith also warned that a business-dominated political system would allow a conspiracy of businesses and industry against consumers, with the former scheming to influence politics and legislation. Smith states that the interest of manufacturers and merchants "in any particular branch of trade or manufactures, is always in some respects different from, and even opposite to, that of the public ... The proposal of any new law or regulation of commerce which comes from this order, ought always to be listened to with great precaution, and ought never be adopted till after having been long and carefully examined, not only with the most scrupulous, but with the most suspicious attention."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gopnik |first=Adam |title=Market Man |journal=[[The New Yorker]] |issue=18 October 2010 |page=82 |url=http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/books/2010/10/18/101018crbo_books_gopnik |accessdate=27 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus Smith's chief worry seems to be when business is given special protections or privileges from government; by contrast, in the absence of such special political favours, he believed that business activities were generally beneficial to the whole society:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is the great multiplication of the production of all the different arts, in consequence of the division of labour, which occasions, in a well-governed society, that universal opulence which extends itself to the lowest ranks of the people. Every workman has a great quantity of his own work to dispose of beyond what he himself has occasion for; and every other workman being exactly in the same situation, he is enabled to exchange a great quantity of his own goods for a great quantity, or, what comes to the same thing, for the price of a great quantity of theirs. He supplies them abundantly with what they have occasion for, and they accommodate him as amply with what he has occasion for, and a general plenty diffuses itself through all the different ranks of society. (''The Wealth of Nations,'' I.i.10)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The neoclassical interest in Smith's statement about "an invisible hand" originates in the possibility of seeing it as a precursor of [[neoclassical economics]] and its concept of [[General equilibrium theory|general equilibrium]] – [[Paul Samuelson|Samuelson's]] "Economics" refers six times to Smith's "invisible hand". To emphasise this connection, Samuelson&lt;ref&gt;Samuelson, P.&amp;nbsp;A./Nordhaus, William&amp;nbsp;D., 1989, ''Economics'', 13th edition, N.Y. et al.: McGraw-Hill, p. 825.&lt;/ref&gt; quotes Smith's "invisible hand" statement substituting "general interest" for "public interest". Samuelson&lt;ref&gt;Samuelson, P.&amp;nbsp;A./Nordhaus, William&amp;nbsp;D., 1989, idem, p. 825.&lt;/ref&gt; concludes: "Smith was unable to prove the essence of his invisible-hand doctrine. Indeed, until the 1940s, no one knew how to prove, even to state properly, the kernel of truth in this proposition about perfectly competitive market."

Very differently, classical economists see in Smith's first sentences his programme to promote "The Wealth of Nations". Using the physiocratical concept of the economy as a circular process, to secure growth the inputs of Period 2 must exceed the inputs of Period 1. Therefore, those outputs of Period 1 which are not used or usable as inputs of Period 2 are regarded as unproductive labour, as they do not contribute to growth. This is what Smith had heard in France from, among others, [[François Quesnay]], whose ideas Smith was so impressed by that he might have dedicated ''The Wealth of Nations'' to him had he not died beforehand.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Buchan|2006|p=80}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, D., 1799, ''Essays on Philosophical Subjects, to which is prefixed An Account of the Life and Writings of the Author by Dugald Steward, F.R.S.E.'', Basil; from the Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, Read by M. Steward, 21 January, and 18 March 1793; in: The Glasgow edition of the Works and Correspondence of Adam Smith, 1982, vol. 3, pp. 304 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; To this French insight that unproductive labour should be reduced to use labour more productively, Smith added his own proposal, that productive labour should be made even more productive by deepening the [[division of labour]]. Smith argued that deepening the division of labour under competition leads to greater productivity, which leads to lower prices and thus an increasing standard of living—"general plenty" and "universal opulence"—for all. Extended markets and increased production lead to the continuous reorganisation of production and the invention of new ways of producing, which in turn lead to further increased production, lower prices, and improved standards of living. Smith's central message is, therefore, that under dynamic competition, a growth machine secures "The Wealth of Nations". Smith's argument predicted Britain's evolution as the workshop of the world, underselling and outproducing all its competitors. The opening sentences of the "Wealth of Nations" summarise this policy:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The annual labour of every nation is the fund which originally supplies it with all the necessaries and conveniences of life which it annually consumes ... . [T]his produce ... bears a greater or smaller proportion to the number of those who are to consume it ... .[B]ut this proportion must in every nation be regulated by two different circumstances;
* first, by the skill, dexterity, and judgment with which its labour is generally applied; and,
* secondly, by the proportion between the number of those who are employed in useful labour, and that of those who are not so employed [emphasis added].&lt;ref&gt;Smith, A., 1976, vol. 2a, p. 10, idem&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, Smith added that the "abundance or scantiness of this supply too seems to depend more upon the former of those two circumstances than upon the latter."&lt;ref&gt;Smith, A., 1976, vol. 1, p. 10, para. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticism and dissent===
[[Alfred Marshall]] criticised Smith's definition of the economy on several points. He argued that man should be equally important as money, services are as important as goods, and that there must be an emphasis on human welfare, instead of just wealth. The "invisible hand" only works well when both production and consumption operates in free markets, with small ("atomistic") producers and consumers allowing supply and demand to fluctuate and equilibrate. In conditions of monopoly and oligopoly, the "invisible hand" fails. Nobel Prize-winning economist [[Joseph E. Stiglitz]] says, on the topic of one of Smith's better-known ideas: "the reason that the [[invisible hand]] often seems invisible is that it is often not there."&lt;ref&gt;''The Roaring Nineties'', 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other works===
[[File:Adam Smith Grave.JPG|thumb|upright|Smith's burial place in [[Canongate Kirkyard]]|alt=A burial]]

Shortly before his death, Smith had nearly all his manuscripts destroyed. In his last years, he seemed to have been planning two major treatises, one on the theory and history of law and one on the sciences and arts. The posthumously published ''Essays on Philosophical Subjects'', a history of [[astronomy]] down to Smith's own era, plus some thoughts on [[ancient physics]] and [[metaphysics]], probably contain parts of what would have been the latter treatise. ''[[Lectures on Jurisprudence]]'' were notes taken from Smith's early lectures, plus an early draft of ''The Wealth of Nations'', published as part of the 1976 Glasgow Edition of the works and correspondence of Smith. Other works, including some published posthumously, include ''Lectures on Justice, Police, Revenue, and Arms'' (1763) (first published in 1896); and ''Essays on Philosophical Subjects'' (1795).&lt;ref&gt;''The Glasgow edition of the Works and Correspondence of Adam Smith'', 1982, 6 volumes&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==

===In economics and moral philosophy===
''The Wealth of Nations'' was a precursor to the modern academic discipline of economics. In this and other works, Smith expounded how rational self-interest and competition can lead to economic prosperity. Smith was controversial in his own day and his general approach and writing style were often satirised by [[Tories (British political party)|Tory]] writers in the moralising tradition of Hogarth and Swift, as a discussion at the University of Winchester suggests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |accessdate=11 February 2010 |url=http://journalism.winchester.ac.uk/?page=343 |title=Adam Smith – Jonathan Swift |publisher=University of Winchester |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091128233435/http://journalism.winchester.ac.uk/?page=343 |archivedate=28 November 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, ''The Wealth of Nations'' was named among the 100 Best Scottish Books of all time.&lt;ref name="100 Best Scottish Books, Adam Smith" /&gt; 

In light of the arguments put forward by Smith and other economic theorists in Britain, academic belief in mercantilism began to decline in Britain in the late 18th century. During the [[Industrial Revolution]], Britain embraced free trade and Smith's ''laissez-faire'' economics, and via the [[British Empire]], used its power to spread a broadly liberal economic model around the world, characterised by open markets, and relatively barrier-free domestic and international trade.&lt;ref&gt;L.Seabrooke (2006). "Global Standards of Market Civilization". p. 192. Taylor &amp; Francis 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

[[George Stigler]] attributes to Smith "the most important substantive proposition in all of economics". It is that, under competition, owners of resources (for example labour, land, and capital) will use them most profitably, resulting in an equal rate of return in [[Economic equilibrium|equilibrium]] for all uses, adjusted for apparent differences arising from such factors as training, trust, hardship, and unemployment.&lt;ref&gt;Stigler, George&amp;nbsp;J. (1976). "The Successes and Failures of Professor Smith," ''Journal of Political Economy'', 84(6), [https://www.jstor.org/pss/1831274 pp. 1199]–213, 1202. Also published as Selected Papers, No. 50 [http://google.com/scholar?q=cache:hs0XwYbafSgJ:scholar.google.com/&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=80000000000000 (PDF)]{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Graduate School of Business, University of Chicago.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Paul Samuelson]] finds in Smith's pluralist use of supply and demand as applied to wages, rents, and profit a valid and valuable anticipation of the [[general equilibrium]] modelling of [[Walras]] a century later. Smith's allowance for wage increases in the short and intermediate term from capital accumulation and invention contrasted with [[Thomas Robert Malthus|Malthus]], [[David Ricardo|Ricardo]], and [[Karl Marx]] in their propounding a rigid subsistence–wage theory of labour supply.&lt;ref&gt;Samuelson, Paul A. (1977). "A Modern Theorist's Vindication of Adam Smith," ''American Economic Review'', 67(1), [https://www.jstor.org/pss/1815879 p. 42.] Reprinted in J.C. Wood, ed., ''Adam Smith: Critical Assessments'', pp. 498–509. [https://books.google.com/books?id=B8FY8mo5zX4C&amp;printsec=find&amp;pg=PA498=gbs_atb#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Preview.]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Joseph Schumpeter]] criticised Smith for a lack of technical rigour, yet he argued that this enabled Smith's writings to appeal to wider audiences: "His very limitation made for success. Had he been more brilliant, he would not have been taken so seriously. Had he dug more deeply, had he unearthed more recondite truth, had he used more difficult and ingenious methods, he would not have been understood. But he had no such ambitions; in fact he disliked whatever went beyond plain common sense. He never moved above the heads of even the dullest readers. He led them on gently, encouraging them by trivialities and homely observations, making them feel comfortable all along."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Schumpeter History of Economic Analysis |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=185}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Classical economists presented competing theories of those of Smith, termed the "[[labour theory of value#The theory's development|labour theory of value]]". Later Marxian economics descending from classical economics also use Smith's labour theories, in part. The first volume of [[Karl Marx]]'s major work, ''Das Kapital'', was published in German in 1867. In it, Marx focused on the labour theory of value and what he considered to be the exploitation of labour by capital.&lt;ref name="Roemer"&gt;[[John Roemer|Roemer, J.E.]] (1987). "Marxian Value Analysis". ''[[The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics]]'', v. 3, 383.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Ernest Mandel|Mandel, Ernest]] (1987). "Marx, Karl Heinrich", ''The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics'' v. 3, pp. 372, 376.&lt;/ref&gt; The labour theory of value held that the value of a thing was determined by the labour that went into its production. This contrasts with the modern contention of [[neoclassical economics]], that the value of a thing is determined by what one is willing to give up to obtain the thing.

[[File:Adam Smith Theatre, Bennochy Road, Kirkcaldy.jpg|thumb|The Adam Smith Theatre in [[Kirkcaldy]]|alt=A brown building]]

The body of theory later termed "neoclassical economics" or "[[marginalism#The Marginal Revolution|marginalism]]" formed from about 1870 to 1910. The term "economics" was popularised by such neoclassical economists as [[Alfred Marshall]] as a concise synonym for "economic science" and a substitute for the earlier, broader term "[[political economy]]" used by Smith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Marshall, Alfred |author2=Marshall, Mary Paley |year=1879 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=NLcJAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA1#PPA2,M1 |title=The Economics of Industry |page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Jevons, W. Stanley |year=1879 |edition=2nd |url=https://books.google.com/?id=aYcBAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PR3#PPR3,M1 |title=The Theory of Political Economy |page=xiv}}&lt;/ref&gt; This corresponded to the influence on the subject of mathematical methods used in the [[natural science]]s.&lt;ref name="Clark"&gt;Clark, B. (1998). ''Political-economy: A comparative approach'', 2nd ed., Westport, CT: Praeger. p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; Neoclassical economics systematised [[supply and demand]] as joint determinants of price and quantity in market equilibrium, affecting both the allocation of output and the distribution of income. It dispensed with the [[labour theory of value]] of which Smith was most famously identified with in classical economics, in favour of a [[marginal utility]] theory of value on the demand side and a more general theory of costs on the supply side.&lt;ref&gt;Campos, Antonietta (1987). "Marginalist Economics", ''The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics'', v. 3, p. 320&lt;/ref&gt;

The bicentennial anniversary of the publication of ''The Wealth of Nations'' was celebrated in 1976, resulting in increased interest for ''The Theory of Moral Sentiments'' and his other works throughout academia. After 1976, Smith was more likely to be represented as the author of both ''The Wealth of Nations'' and ''The Theory of Moral Sentiments'', and thereby as the founder of a moral philosophy and the science of economics. His ''[[homo economicus]]'' or "economic man" was also more often represented as a moral person. Additionally, economists David Levy and Sandra Peart in "The Secret History of the Dismal Science" point to his opposition to hierarchy and beliefs in inequality, including racial inequality, and provide additional support for those who point to Smith's opposition to slavery, colonialism, and empire. They show the caricatures of Smith drawn by the opponents of views on hierarchy and inequality in this online article. Emphasised also are Smith's statements of the need for high wages for the poor, and the efforts to keep wages low. In The "Vanity of the Philosopher: From Equality to Hierarchy in Postclassical Economics", Peart and Levy also cite Smith's view that a common street porter was not intellectually inferior to a philosopher,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|1977|loc=§Book I, Chapter 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and point to the need for greater appreciation of the public views in discussions of science and other subjects now considered to be technical. They also cite Smith's opposition to the often expressed view that science is superior to common sense.&lt;ref&gt;"The Vanity of the Philosopher: From Equality to Hierarchy" in ''Postclassical Economics'' [http://www.wfu.edu/~hammond/review%20of%20Peart&amp;Levy,%20final.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

Smith also explained the relationship between growth of private property and civil government:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Men may live together in society with some tolerable degree of security, though there is no civil magistrate to protect them from the injustice of those passions. But avarice and ambition in the rich, in the poor the hatred of labour and the love of present ease and enjoyment, are the passions which prompt to invade property, passions much more steady in their operation, and much more universal in their influence. Wherever there is great property there is great inequality. For one very rich man there must be at least five hundred poor, and the affluence of the few supposes the indigence of the many. The affluence of the rich excites the indignation of the poor, who are often both driven by want, and prompted by envy, to invade his possessions. It is only under the shelter of the civil magistrate that the owner of that valuable property, which is acquired by the labour of many years, or perhaps of many successive generations, can sleep a single night in security. He is at all times surrounded by unknown enemies, whom, though he never provoked, he can never appease, and from whose injustice he can be protected only by the powerful arm of the civil magistrate continually held up to chastise it. The acquisition of valuable and extensive property, therefore, necessarily requires the establishment of civil government. Where there is no property, or at least none that exceeds the value of two or three days' labour, civil government is not so necessary. Civil government supposes a certain subordination. But as the necessity of civil government gradually grows up with the acquisition of valuable property, so the principal causes which naturally introduce subordination gradually grow up with the growth of that valuable property. (...) Men of inferior wealth combine to defend those of superior wealth in the possession of their property, in order that men of superior wealth may combine to defend them in the possession of theirs. All the inferior shepherds and herdsmen feel that the security of their own herds and flocks depends upon the security of those of the great shepherd or herdsman; that the maintenance of their lesser authority depends upon that of his greater authority, and that upon their subordination to him depends his power of keeping their inferiors in subordination to them. They constitute a sort of little nobility, who feel themselves interested to defend the property and to support the authority of their own little sovereign in order that he may be able to defend their property and to support their authority. Civil government, so far as it is instituted for the security of property, is in reality instituted for the defence of the rich against the poor, or of those who have some property against those who have none at all. (Source: ''The Wealth of Nations'', Book 5, Chapter 1, Part 2)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===In British Imperial debates===
Smith's chapter on colonies, in turn, would help shape British imperial debates from the mid-19th century onward. ''The Wealth of Nations'' would become an ambiguous text regarding the imperial question. In his chapter on colonies, Smith pondered how to solve the crisis developing across the Atlantic among the empire's 13 American colonies. He offered two different proposals for easing tensions. The first proposal called for giving the colonies their independence, and by thus parting on a friendly basis, Britain would be able to develop and maintain a free-trade relationship with them, and possibly even an informal military alliance. Smith's second proposal called for a theoretical imperial federation that would bring the colonies and the metropole closer together through an imperial parliamentary system and imperial free trade.&lt;ref&gt;E. A. Benians, ‘Adam Smith’s project of an empire’, ''Cambridge Historical Journal'' 1 (1925): 249–83&lt;/ref&gt;

Smith's most prominent disciple in 19th-century Britain, peace advocate [[Richard Cobden]], preferred the first proposal. Cobden would lead the [[Anti-Corn Law League]] in overturning the [[Corn Laws]] in 1846, shifting Britain to a policy of free trade and empire "on the cheap" for decades to come. This hands-off approach toward the British Empire would become known as [[Cobdenism]] or the [[Manchester Liberalism|Manchester School]].&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Howe, ''Free trade and liberal England, 1846–1946'' (Oxford, 1997)&lt;/ref&gt; By the turn of the century, however, advocates of Smith's second proposal such as [[Joseph Shield Nicholson]] would become ever more vocal in opposing Cobdenism, calling instead for imperial federation.&lt;ref&gt;J. Shield Nicholson, ''A project of empire: a critical study of the economics of imperialism, with special reference to the ideas of Adam Smith'' (London, 1909)&lt;/ref&gt; As Marc-William Palen notes: "On the one hand, Adam Smith’s late nineteenth and early twentieth-century Cobdenite adherents used his theories to argue for gradual imperial devolution and empire ‘on the cheap’. On the other, various proponents of imperial federation throughout the British World sought to use Smith’s theories to overturn the predominant Cobdenite hands-off imperial approach and instead, with a firm grip, bring the empire closer than ever before."&lt;ref&gt;Marc-William Palen, [http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=9159669&amp;fileId=S0018246X13000101 “Adam Smith as Advocate of Empire, c. 1870–1932,”] ''Historical Journal'' 57: 1 (March 2014): 179–98.&lt;/ref&gt; Smith's ideas thus played an important part in subsequent debates over the British Empire.

===Portraits, monuments, and banknotes===

A large-scale memorial of Smith by [[Alexander Stoddart]] was unveiled on 4 July 2008 in Edinburgh.

A bust of Smith is in the Hall of Heroes of the [[National Wallace Monument]] in [[Stirling]].

===Residence===
Adam Smith resided at Panmure House from 1778 to 1790. This residence has now been purchased by the [[Edinburgh Business School]] at [[Heriot Watt University]] and fundraising has begun to restore it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The restoration of Panmure House |url=http://www.adamsmith.org/blog/misc/the-restoration-of-panmure-house |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120122103606/http://www.adamsmith.org/blog/misc/the-restoration-of-panmure-house |archivedate=22 January 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Adam Smith's Home Gets Business School Revival |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/video/adam-smith-s-home-gets-business-school-revival-byl368j8Sii~TiQiBHwEyw.html |work=Bloomberg}}&lt;/ref&gt; Part of the Northern end of the original building appears to have been demolished in the 19th century to make way for an iron foundry.

===As a symbol of free-market economics===
[[File:Sanborn-CSU.jpg|thumb|upright|''Adam Smith's Spinning Top'', sculpture by [[Jim Sanborn]] at [[Cleveland State University]]|alt=A sculpture of an upside down cone]]

Smith has been celebrated by advocates of free-market policies as the founder of free-market economics, a view reflected in the naming of bodies such as the [[Adam Smith Institute]] in London, the Adam Smith Society&lt;ref name="urlThe Adam Smith Society"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adamsmith.it/presentazione.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070721032612/http://www.adamsmith.it/presentazione.html |archivedate=21 July 2007 |title=The Adam Smith Society |accessdate=24 May 2008 |publisher=The Adam Smith Society}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Australian Adam Smith Club,&lt;ref name="urlThe Australian Adam Smith Club"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adamsmithclub.org/ |title=The Australian Adam Smith Club |accessdate=12 October 2008 |publisher=Adam Smith Club}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in terms such as the Adam Smith necktie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.minneapolisfed.org/publications_papers/pub_display.cfm?id=3748 |title=Interview with Milton Friedman |last=Levy |first=David |date=June 1992 |publisher=Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis |accessdate=1 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alan Greenspan]] argues that, while Smith did not coin the term ''[[laissez-faire]]'', "it was left to Adam Smith to identify the more-general set of principles that brought conceptual clarity to the seeming chaos of market transactions". Greenspan continues that ''The Wealth of Nations'' was "one of the great achievements in human intellectual history".&lt;ref name="urlFRB: Speech, Greenspan – Adam Smith – 6 February 2005"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/speeches/2005/20050206/default.htm |title=FRB: Speech, Greenspan – Adam Smith – 6 February 2005 |accessdate=31 May 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080512080427/http://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/speeches/2005/20050206/default.htm |archivedate=12 May 2008 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[P.

Other writers have argued that Smith's support for ''laissez-faire'' (which in French means leave alone) has been overstated. [[Herbert Stein]] wrote that the people who "wear an Adam Smith necktie" do it to "make a statement of their devotion to the idea of free markets and [[limited government]]", and that this misrepresents Smith's ideas. Stein writes that Smith "was not pure or doctrinaire about this idea. He viewed government intervention in the market with great skepticism...yet he was prepared to accept or propose qualifications to that policy in the specific cases where he judged that their net effect would be beneficial and would not undermine the basically free character of the system. He did not wear the Adam Smith necktie." In Stein's reading, ''The Wealth of Nations'' could justify the [[Food and Drug Administration]], the [[Consumer Product Safety Commission]], mandatory employer health benefits, environmentalism, and "[[Pigovian tax|discriminatory taxation]] to deter [[sin tax|improper]] or [[sumptuary tax|luxurious behavior]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Stein, Herbert |date=6 April 1994 |title=Board of Contributors: Remembering Adam Smith |journal=[[The Wall Street Journal Asia]] |page=A14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, Vivienne Brown stated in ''[[The Economic Journal]]'' that in the 20th-century United States, [[Reaganomics]] supporters, the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', and other similar sources have spread among the general public a partial and misleading vision of Smith, portraying him as an "extreme dogmatic defender of ''laissez-faire'' capitalism and [[supply-side economics]]".&lt;ref name="Brown93"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Brown, Vivienne |date=January 1993 |journal=[[The Economic Journal]] |volume=103 |issue=416 |pages=230–32 |doi=10.2307/2234351 |title=Untitled review of 'Capitalism as a Moral System: Adam Smith's Critique of the Free Market Economy' and 'Adam Smith and his Legacy for Modern Capitalism' |last2=Pack |first2=Spencer J. |last3=Werhane |first3=Patricia H. |jstor=2234351}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, ''The Wealth of Nations'' includes the following statement on the payment of taxes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The subjects of every state ought to contribute towards the support of the government, as nearly as possible, in proportion to their respective abilities; that is, in proportion to the revenue which they respectively enjoy under the protection of the state.&lt;ref name="Smith 1977 loc=bk. V, ch. 2"&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|1977|loc=bk. V, ch. 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Some commentators have argued that Smith's works show support for a progressive, not flat, income tax and that he specifically named taxes that he thought should be required by the state, among them [[Luxury tax|luxury-goods taxes]] and tax on rent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/books/2010/10/18/101018crbo_books_gopnik |title=Market Man |date=18 October 2010 |work=The New Yorker}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet Smith argued for the "impossibility of taxing the people, in proportion to their economic revenue, by any capitation" (''The Wealth of Nations,'' V.ii.k.1). Smith argued that taxes should principally go toward protecting "justice" and "certain publick institutions" that were necessary for the benefit of all of society, but that could not be provided by private enterprise (''The Wealth of Nations,'' IV.ix.51).

Additionally, Smith outlined the proper expenses of the government in ''The Wealth of Nations, Book V, Ch. I''. Included in his requirements of a government is to enforce contracts and provide justice system, grant patents and copy rights, provide public goods such as infrastructure, provide national defence, and regulate banking. The role of the government was to provide goods "of such a nature that the profit could never repay the expense to any individual" such as roads, bridges, canals, and harbours. He also encouraged invention and new ideas through his patent enforcement and support of infant industry monopolies. He supported partial public subsidies for elementary education, and he believed that competition among religious institutions would provide general benefit to the society. In such cases, however, Smith argued for local rather than centralised control: "Even those publick works which are of such a nature that they cannot afford any revenue for maintaining themselves . . . are always better maintained by a local or provincial revenue, under the management of a local and provincial administration, than by the general revenue of the state" (''Wealth of Nations,'' V.i.d.18). Finally, he outlined how the government should support the dignity of the monarch or chief magistrate, such that they are equal or above the public in fashion. He even states that monarchs should be provided for in a greater fashion than magistrates of a republic because "we naturally expect more splendor in the court of a king than in the mansion-house of a [[doge]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|1977|loc=bk. V}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, he allowed that in some specific circumstances, retaliatory tariffs may be beneficial:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The recovery of a great foreign market will generally more than compensate the transitory inconvenience of paying dearer during a short time for some sorts of goods.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, A., 1976, ''The Glasgow edition'', vol. 2a, p. 468.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, he added that in general, a retaliatory tariff "seems a bad method of compensating the injury done to certain classes of our people, to do another injury ourselves, not only to those classes, but to almost all the other classes of them" (''The Wealth of Nations,'' IV.ii.39).

[[Economic historian]]s such as [[Jacob Viner]] regard Smith as a strong advocate of free markets and limited government (what Smith called "natural liberty"), but not as a dogmatic supporter of ''laissez-faire''.&lt;ref name="Viner 1927"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Viner, Jacob |date=April 1927 |journal=[[The Journal of Political Economy]] |volume=35 |issue=2 |pages=198–232 |doi=10.1086/253837 |title=Adam Smith and Laissez-faire |jstor=1823421}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Economist [[Daniel B. Klein|Daniel Klein]] believes using the term "free-market economics" or "free-market economist" to identify the ideas of Smith is too general and slightly misleading. Klein offers six characteristics central to the identity of Smith's economic thought and argues that a new name is needed to give a more accurate depiction of the "Smithian" identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Klein, Daniel B. |year=2008 |title=Toward a Public and Professional Identity for Our Economics |journal=Econ Journal Watch |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=358–72 |url=http://econjwatch.org/articles/toward-a-public-and-professional-identity-for-our-economics}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Klein, Daniel B. |year=2009 |title=Desperately Seeking Smithians: Responses to the Questionnaire about Building an Identity |journal=Econ Journal Watch |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=113–80 |url=http://econjwatch.org/articles/desperately-seeking-smithians-responses-to-the-questionnaire-about-building-an-identity}}&lt;/ref&gt; Economist [[David Ricardo]] set straight some of the misunderstandings about Smith's thoughts on free market. Most people still fall victim to the thinking that Smith was a free-market economist without exception, though he was not. Ricardo pointed out that Smith was in support of helping infant industries. Smith believed that the government should subsidise newly formed industry, but he did fear that when the infant industry grew into adulthood, it would be unwilling to surrender the government help.&lt;ref name="New Ideas From Dead Economists"&gt;Buchholz, Todd (December 1990). pp. 38–39.&lt;/ref&gt; Smith also supported tariffs on imported goods to counteract an internal tax on the same good. Smith also fell to pressure in supporting some tariffs in support for national defence.&lt;ref name="New Ideas From Dead Economists"/&gt;

Some have also claimed, [[Emma Rothschild]] among them, that Smith would have supported a minimum wage,&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Christopher. "Adam Smith and Liberal Economics: Reading the Minimum Wage Debate of 1795–96," ''Econ Journal Watch'' 8(2): 110–25, May 2011 [http://econjwatch.org/articles/adam-smith-and-liberal-economics-reading-the-minimum-wage-debate-of-1795-96]&lt;/ref&gt; although no direct textual evidence supports the claim. Indeed, Smith wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The price of labour, it must be observed, cannot be ascertained very accurately anywhere, different prices being often paid at the same place and for the same sort of labour, not only according to the different abilities of the workmen, but according to the easiness or hardness of the masters. Where wages are not regulated by law, all that we can pretend to determine is what are the most usual; and experience seems to show that law can never regulate them properly, though it has often pretended to do so. (''The Wealth of Nations'', Book 1, Chapter 8)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, Smith also noted, to the contrary, the existence of an [[equality of bargaining power|imbalanced, inequality of bargaining power]]:&lt;ref&gt;A Smith, ''Wealth of Nations'' (1776) Book I, ch 8&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;A landlord, a farmer, a master manufacturer, a merchant, though they did not employ a single workman, could generally live a year or two upon the stocks which they have already acquired. Many workmen could not subsist a week, few could subsist a month, and scarce any a year without employment. In the long run, the workman may be as necessary to his master as his master is to him, but the necessity is not so immediate.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Manhattan Ann Street.JPG|thumb|325px|right|"Quaint name, Ann Street. Width of same, ten feet." -Words of the song "Ann Street" by [[Charles Ives]]]]

'''Ann Street''' is a 3-block-long street located in the [[Financial District, Manhattan|Financial District]] in [[Lower Manhattan]]. It runs roughly east to west from [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]] to [[Gold Street (Manhattan)|Gold Street]].

== History ==
[[File:Ann street manhattan map.jpeg|thumb|200px|right|Ann Street (in yellow) is two blocks south of [[New York City Hall]].]]

Ann Street is one of the oldest streets in New York City, appearing on a map created in 1728. Ann Street was named after Ann White, the wife of a developer and merchant, Capt. Thomas White. She may have urged him to name the street after her because other merchants' wives already had streets named after them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite streetbook}}&lt;/ref&gt; The street is relatively small and short compared with the other lower Manhattan streets named after merchants' wives. There have been several other streets in the city named Ann Street. One laid out between Reade and Franklin Streets prior to 1797 later became Elm Street. "Anne Street" was also a name circa 1748 for part of the present William Street. Today, there is only one Ann Street in Manhattan.

"[[Barnum's American Museum]]", operated by P.T. Barnum, was located on the corner of Ann Street, [[Vesey Street]], [[Park Row (Manhattan)|Park Row]], and Broadway. It was one of the most popular showplaces in the United States during the 19th century. Barnum made a special hit in 1842 with the exhibition of Charles Stratton, the celebrated [[midget]] "[[General Tom Thumb]]", as well as the [[Fiji Mermaid]] which he exhibited in collaboration with his [[Boston]] counterpart [[Moses Kimball]]. The line in the Charles Ives song, ''Barnum's Mob, Ann Street,'' refers to the crowds drawn to see the curiosities at this museum.

On May 10, 1979, a woman was attacked on Ann Street by a "pack of rats" as she was walking to her car. The woman hurried into the car and the rats climbed onto it. Several witnesses called the police. The rats were later found living in the burnt-out wreck of "Ryan's Cafe," a [[bar (establishment)|bar]] that had served the area since the 1860s. The bar had exploded due to a [[gas leak]] on December 11, 1970, and remained an empty lot throughout the 1970s. This empty lot was widely regarded to be the source of the rat problem.&lt;ref&gt;"Scores of Rats Are Found at Site Where They Attacked a Woman; Consequences of Rat Bites Poison Injected Into Burrows", ''[[The New York Times]]'' by Pranay B. Gupte, May 12, 1979. p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Tugboats in New York City|city tugboat]] strike in 1979 compounded the problem as heaps of [[waste|garbage]] collected on Ann Street and in the abandoned lot causing the rat population to explode. The rat attack incident prompted [[Ed Koch|Mayor Ed Koch]] to order city pest control personnel to take immediate action on the problem. They killed and trapped hundreds of rats in just a few days, drawing media attention. The close proximity of Ann Street to City Hall made the incident all the more embarrassing. It helped to add to negative impressions of the city for years, but it also prompted people to act to improve downtown.&lt;ref&gt;''Rats: Observations on the History and Habitat of the City's Most Unwanted Inhabitant'' - by Robert Sullivan&lt;/ref&gt;

The recent addition of [[condominium]]s to the upper floors of the some of older buildings has added more life to the area. Ann Street was gutted and repaved in 2006, as part of a city water main replacement project, greatly reducing the rat problems and further beautifying the area.  The corner of Ann and Vesey Streets, Park Row, and Broadway is still as busy as it was in Barnum's day, shoppers and tourists frequent [[J&amp;R|J&amp;R Computer World]], one of the largest electronics stores in the nation.

== In popular culture ==
[[File:Barnumad.png|right|thumb|200px|Barnum's American Museum was located on Ann Street.]]

Ann Street is the title and subject of a song by the early 20th century experimental classical composer [[Charles Ives]] with lyrics based on a poem written by Maurice Morris in 1921:

[Shout.]&lt;br&gt;
Broadway!

[Sing.]&lt;br&gt;
''Quaint name     Ann street.''&lt;br&gt;
''Width of same,      ten feet.''&lt;br&gt;
''[[Barnum's American Museum|Barnum's mob]]     Ann street,''&lt;br&gt;
''Far from ob-     solete.''&lt;br&gt;
''Narrow, yes     Ann street,''&lt;br&gt;
''But business,     Both feet.''

[Shout.]&lt;br&gt;
Nassau crosses Ann Street!

[Sing.]&lt;br&gt;
''Sun just hits     Ann street,''&lt;br&gt;
''Then it quits     Some greet!''&lt;br&gt;
''Rather short,     Ann Street.''&lt;br&gt;

The crossing of [[Nassau Street (Manhattan)|Nassau Street]] and Ann Street is a highlight of the song and the street itself. Nassau Street is a business district filled with shops. At the intersection one can see a view deep into the heart of the [[Financial District, Manhattan|Financial District]] and the facade of the [[New York Stock Exchange]] (NYSE) six blocks away. Nassau Street and Ann Street meet at uneven angles leading one to feel rather surprised by the sudden explosion of pedestrian traffic, shops and lights when crossing their intersection.

'''Anton Eichleiter''' ({{lang-hu|Eichleiter Antal}}, [[Augsburg]], 1 March 1831 – [[Rorschach, Switzerland|Rorschach]], 31 May 1902) was a [[German people|German]] iron manufacturer, manager of the [[Ganz Works]].

==Life==
===Early years===
Eichleiter was born to a family originated in [[Augsburg]]. His parents were Andreas Eichleiter, teacher in the [[Lutheran]] [[Gymnasium bei St. Anna]], and Caroline Steinhard, daughter of a [[Lutheran]] priest. Eichleiter had eight siblings of whom three died in an early age and after his mother's death his father had to take care of them. After the primary school he went to an industrial and agricultural vocational school in Augsburg. Then he studied at the [[Augsburg University of Applied Sciences|Polytechnikum]] (today the [[Augsburg University of Applied Sciences]]).

===Budapest, Hungary===
After finishing his studies he worked first as a locksmith then as a technical drawer in [[Erfurt]], [[Thuringia]] at the main workshop of the [[Thüringer Bahn]]. In 1854 he was employed by the [[MAN SE|Cramer-Klett]] (predecessor of [[MAN SE]]) where he was commissioned to hand over the produced wagons to the 'Tisza Railway' (''Tiszai Vasút'') company in [[Szolnok]], [[Austria-Hungary]]. The wheels of these wagons were delivered by the [[Ganz Works]] based in [[Buda]], [[Austria-Hungary]]. He met the [[Swiss]]-born [[Hungary|Hungarian]] industrialist [[Ábrahám Ganz]] (father of the [[Ganz Works]]) there who offered him a job in his foundry. His first project was to create a new, bigger workshop. He designed the one-piece [[chill (casting)|chill]] casted peak inserts to the railway crossings. Beside his planner job he managed the correspondence with different railway companies.

One day his long time friend, [[András Mechwart]] visited him in [[Buda]]. [[Ábrahám Ganz]] offered Mechwart as well a job in his factory which he accepted. Mechwart was also a brother-in-law of Eichleiter, because Eichleiter's sister, Luise was the wife of Mechwart.&lt;ref&gt;[https://familysearch.org/search/record/results?count=20&amp;query=%2Bsurname%3Aeichleiter%20%2Bbirth_place%3Aaugsburg]&lt;/ref&gt;

Before his death Ganz concluded with Eichleiter, [[Ulrich Keller]] and Mechwart a secret, final agreement that stated, in the case of his unexpected death Eichleiter has to become the head of the company, Eichleiter gets 22% of the shares, Keller gets 10% and Mechwart 8% and his heirs living in [[Switzerland]] get the majority (the other 60%) of the shares and they cannot sell the company to outsiders for ten years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gyartastrend.hu/muveltmernok/cikk/generaciovaltas_a_legendas_magyar_csaladi_vallalkozasokban]&lt;/ref&gt; So after Ganz's tragical death in 1867 Eichleiter, Mechwart and Keller became the manager of the [[Ganz Works]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ganz-holding.hu/index.php/a-mult/98-a-mult/199-kiemelkedo-szemelyisegek]&lt;/ref&gt; They changed the name of the company to 'Ganz &amp; Co.'(''Ganz és Társa''). But after two years the heirs of Ganz sold the company to Eichleiter, Keller and Mechwart. They changed the name again in 1869, this time to 'Ganz &amp; Co. Foundry &amp; Machine Factory Inc.'(''Ganz és Társa Vasöntő és Gépgyár Rt.'') &lt;ref&gt;=[http://www.fokusz.info/index.php?cid=1224723513&amp;aid=1859909322]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1873 because of the crisis Eichleiter and Keller left the company and sold there shares. Mechwart became the head of the [[Ganz Works]].&lt;ref&gt;=[http://www.fokusz.info/index.php?cid=1224723513&amp;aid=1859909322]&lt;/ref&gt;

Eichleiter was a board member of the 'Pest-Buda Beauty Committee' (''Pest-Buda Szépészeti Bizottság'') which served as an architectural judging association. The members were nominated by the Hungarian government. He was also a member of the economic council of the Budapest-based 'First Hungarian Wagon Factory Inc.'(''Első Magyar Vasútikocsigyár Rt.''),&lt;ref&gt;[http://babud.mindenkilapja.hu/html/18580556/render/erdekesseg]&lt;/ref&gt; a technical advisor in a cornstarch producing company and in the [[Salgótarján]], [[Austria-Hungary]] based 'Salgótarján Coal Mine Ltd.' (''Salgótarjáni Szénbányamű''). Eichleiter was also an inspector and board member of the 'Commercial Bank of Buda' (''Budai Kereskedelmi Bank''). Later he became member of the exhibition committee of the [[1873 Vienna World's Fair|World's Fair in Vienna in 1873]], then correspondent and juror at the metal and machine department of the exhibition.

He was awarded the [[Order of Franz Joseph]] by the [[Austro-Hungarian]] emperor, [[Franz Joseph]] for his efforts in the industry development on the [[1873 Vienna World's Fair|World's Fair in Vienna in 1873]]. He was also honored by the Turkish sultan [[Abdülaziz I]] with the 'Medjedich Orden'.

===Switzerland===
All these rolles{{clarify|date=April 2017}} and workes tuckered{{clarify|date=April 2017}} him and made him ill, so he went to [[Thusis]], [[Switzerland]] to relax. At that time he suffered in acute [[gastritis]] and [[Depression (mood)|depression]]. So he decided to change his way of life and move to [[Rorschach, Switzerland|Rorschach]] am [[Bodensee]], [[Canton of St. Gallen]], [[Switzerland]] where he bought the 'Weinhalde Villa'.

In 1871/72 he co-financed the establishment of a new girl's school in the Canton of St. Gallen. He financed, designed and built for the public two school buildings as well. He supported a lot of charity project in Rorschach: theatre, gymnastics association, well drilling for the public etc.

In 1879 he became school counselor, then the head of the school council, then Swiss citizen and honorary citizen of Rorschach.

In 1887 the Swiss parliament wanted to pass a new federal patent law. But in the last three decades the people repeatedly rejected it at the refenda. However, in other developed countries that kind of law already existed at that time and therefore the Swiss intellectual treasure was easier to get stolen. So the federal president of the republic, [[Numa Droz]] took the matter in his hand. He encouraged the communities to establish local pantent committees. Eichleichter became the president of the [[Canton of St. Gallen]]'s committee, then member of the federal committee in [[Bern]] which looked after every single patent cases of Switzerland. And he also helped in the wording of the new federal patent law and lobbied for that. The new law passed by the parliament and people also voted for that, so it came into force in the same year.

After all their children left family nest, Eichleiter sold his house and moved to [[Munich]], [[Bavaria]]. But he died on 31 May 1902 in [[Canton of St. Gallen]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hvsg.ch/pdf/Njbl-HVSG_1g_Q.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Personal life===
On 9 June 1956 he married Doris Wundsch, daughter of a [[Lutheran]] priest of [[Erfurt]].Their first child, Friederike was born on 24 June 1857. Then came Hermann and Emil who both died in a young age. Then in 1864 Anna was born, then Julius (28 May 1866), Bernhard (21 December 1867) and Fritz (28 Januar 1869) came later. Anna, Emil and Friederike suffered in [[meningitis basilaris]].

Luise Eichleiter, Antal's sister was the wife of [[András Mechwart]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://familysearch.org/search/record/results?count=20&amp;query=%2Bsurname%3Amechwart%20%2Bbirth_place%3Aschweinfurt~]&lt;/ref&gt;

Friederike Eichleiter, Antal's sister was the wife [[Julius Gulden]]. Gulden was an old friend of Eichleiter. Eichleiter asked Ganz to hire Gulden as a mechanical engineer in the [[Ganz Works]] like Mechwart. His professional field was the turbine construction.&lt;ref&gt;[https://library.hungaricana.hu/hu/view/ORSZ_KOZL_TechnTortSzle_21/?pg=152&amp;layout=s&amp;query=eichleiter]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2637">'''Antônio Carbonari Netto''' ( ) is a [[Brazil]]ian [[educator]], [[mathematician]], and businessman.

He is founder, [[CEO]] and one of the main [[shareholder]]s of [[Anhanguera Educacional]], a [[holding company|holding]] of 18 institutions of higher education in the [[São Paulo (state)|state of São Paulo]], one of the largest private [[university|universities]] in the country.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.ifc.org/ifcext/che.nsf/Content/SelectedPR?OpenDocument&amp;UNID=C10736CE36999842852571B800530BA6 IFC to finance post-secondary education to lower-income students in Brazil] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100908032512/http://www.ifc.org/ifcext/che.nsf/Content/SelectedPR?OpenDocument&amp;UNID=C10736CE36999842852571B800530BA6 |date=September 8, 2010 }}" (July 27, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to his position and CEO of Anhangüera Educacional, he is [[Dean (education)|dean]] of the [[Centro Universitário Anhangüera of Leme]] (Anhangüera University Center), and director general of the following colleges: Faculdades de [[Valinhos]], Faculdade Comunitária de Campinas, Faculdade Politécnica de [[Jundiaí]] and Faculdade Politécnica de [[Matão]].

Carbonari Netto is a prominent academic and business leader in the private education world in Brazil. He has served in the executive board and councils of several important associations, such as the [[Associação Brasileira de Mantenedoras do Ensino Superior]] (Brazilian Association of Higher Education Organizations), [[Sindicato dos Estabelecimentos do Ensino Superior de São Paulo]] (Syndicate of the Higher Education Institutions of São Paulo), and others.

In late 2011, massive layoffs took place at all Anhangüera Educacional establishments. Over 1500 lecturers and professors with the highest salaries were dismissed, a move focused exclusively on increasing profits.  Classes hours were also decreased, worsening the educational value from the courses offered.

The ''Asthma &amp; Allergy Friendly'' Certification Program was created to scientifically test and identify consumer products that are more suitable for people with asthma and allergies.

==Background==
The avoidance of [[asthma]] triggers and/or [[allergens]] has been recognised by many clinicians and researchers as being an integral part of an asthma management plan.&lt;ref&gt;Walshaw and Evans, Q J Med, 1986{{Full citation needed|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Capristo et al, Allergy, 2004{{Full citation needed|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Platts-Mills, NEJM, 2003{{Full citation needed|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;O'Connor, J Allergy Clin Immunol, 2005{{Full citation needed|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Morgan et al, NEJM, 2004{{Full citation needed|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although there has been some discussion as to whether [[dust mite]] avoidance measures will result in a clinically relevant outcome&lt;ref&gt;Gotzsche, Lancet, 2007{{Full citation needed|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Woodcock et al, NEJM, 2003{{Full citation needed|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Platts-Mills, J Allergy Clin Immunol, 2008{{Full citation needed|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; the resulting debate has given rise to a recommendation by the [[National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute|National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute]] that an asthma management plan should include avoidance of as many allergens as possible to which the individual is sensitive.&lt;ref&gt;Report of the Third International Workshop. JACI vol. 100: no.6, part 1&lt;/ref&gt; This report and others&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt; also assert that no single specific measure is sufficient to reduce allergens: An allergen reduction plan, which encompasses a variety of approaches is necessary to address management of asthma symptoms.

==The Certification Mark==
''Asthma &amp; Allergy Friendly'' is a registered certification mark operated by Allergy Standards Limited&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.allergystandards.com "Allergy Standards"]. allergystandards.com  Allergy Standards.&lt;/ref&gt; in association with not-for-profit asthma and/or allergy organizations in the country of operation. Products are subjected to standardised testing and if they pass, are deemed ''Asthma &amp; Allergy Friendly''. The Asthma &amp; Allergy Friendly Certification Program has been implemented in a number of countries, such as: 
* The United States (in association with the [[Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America]]), 
&lt;gallery&gt;
[[File:US-General-mark.jpg|thumb|asthma &amp; allergy friendly® US mark]]
&lt;/gallery&gt;
* Canada (in association with [[Asthma Canada]])&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asthma.ca/adults/ asthma.ca/adults/ "Asthma Canada"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090213004323/http://asthma.ca/adults/ |date=2009-02-13 }}. asthma.ca  Asthma Canada.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;gallery&gt;
[[File:Canada general-mark.jpg|thumb|asthma &amp; allergy friendly® Canadian mark]]
&lt;/gallery&gt;
* Internationally (operated by Allergy Standards&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.allergystandards.com "Allergy Standards"]. allergystandards.com  Allergy Standards.&lt;/ref&gt;)

The allergen immunoassay sampling and analysis for the certification program is carried out by various accredited partner laboratories such as Berkeley Analytical, [[Testex]] and Airmid Healthgroup specialised in environmental testings and in particular for allergy and asthma,  [[microbiology]], [[molecular biology]], and [[aerobiology]]. Testing is conducted at a uniquely integrated testing facility which combines molecular biology, Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ([[ELISA]]) with state of the art air sampling and particle counting in a highly sophisticated [[Environmental test chambers|environmental test chamber]] facility with a microbiological aerosol capability.

==The Certification Process==
=== Overview of the standards ===
Products bearing the certification mark must come through our rigorous testing standards. Standards assess products for the presence of allergenic dyes and sensitizing chemicals &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/26708986_Chemical_allergens-What_are_the_issues “Chemical Allergens-What Are the Issues?”]. Kimber, Ian, David A. Basketter, and Rebecca J. Dearman. 2010. “Chemical Allergens-What Are the Issues?” Toxicology 268(3): 139–42. access-date=2018-08-28 &lt;/ref&gt;  as well as the capacity for allergen retention and ability to withstand eradication techniques such as repeated washing machine cycles &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso:6330:ed-3:v1:en "ISO 6330:2012(en) Textiles — Domestic washing and drying procedures for textile testing"]. iso.org &lt;/ref&gt;. Product areas that have been certified include textile materials, electrical appliances, building products and kids toys &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.asthmaandallergyfriendly.com/INT/certified-products "Certified Products"]. asthmaandallergyfriendly.com &lt;/ref&gt;. 

=== Objective ===
The Certification Program aims to help consumers make an informed choice when buying products. When consumers see the distinctive mark on a product, they know they are buying an asthma &amp; allergy friendly® product that has come through stringent testing to a series of standards developed by medical and healthcare experts and peer-reviewed by practicing allergology clinicians &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.allergystandards.com "Allergy Standards"]. allergy standards.com &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.aafa.org "Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America"]. aafa.org &lt;/ref&gt;. The number of Certification Standards continues to grow in order to encompass a wide range of products, and help manufacturers to develop healthier products for people with asthma and allergies.

=== Prerequisites ===
Products seeking to be certified ''asthma &amp; allergy friendly'' must pass Allergy Standards rigorous testing standards.  Manufacturers must submit their products for testing to Allergy Standards Ltd approved third party laboratories &lt;ref&gt;[https://berkeleyanalytical.com  "Berkeley Analytical"]. &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.airmidhealthgroup.com  "Airmid Health Group"]. &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[https://ibr-usa.com   "IBR USA"]. &lt;/ref&gt;. Products must be  submitted from current production and consumer ready. In order to pass the standards, products must meet the criteria of the standard relevant to the product category. 

=== Laboratory tests ===
Certification Standards are tailored to the specific product categories. Criteria in the standards may include low or no Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC) emissions, free from banned dyes and allergens according to best international practice&lt;ref&gt;[https://echa.europa.eu/home "European Chemicals Agency"]. &lt;/ref&gt;, and capable of either providing a barrier to allergens or effectively removing allergen from the environment. Importantly, products must also demonstrate that they are capable of carrying out their function effectively and are of acceptable quality and construction. For example textiles must be evaluated for barrier function, but must also demonstrate barrier function after washing.  Vacuum cleaners must demonstrate effective allergen removal, but this is also assessed when the bag is near capacity, demonstrating no significant loss of power and no redistribution of dust and allergens.


==Allergy Standards Limited==
Allergy Standards Limited is an International Standards and Certification Body that prepares independent standards for a wide range of products to declare their suitability for people whose lives are affected by allergies and asthma.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allergystandards.com "Allergy Standards"]. allergystandards.com  Allergy Standards Limited.&lt;/ref&gt; Their headquarters are based in Dublin, Ireland.

==Certified Companies==
[[Dyson (company)]] has been certified since 2015 with the launch of their Dyson Humidifier and have also certified several of their floor care products with their vacuum cleaners, both full-size upright and canister vacuums as well as the cord free vacuum cleaner.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.dyson.com/air-treatment/allergy.html "Dyson Allergy"]. dyson.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[True Value]] Company has been certified since July 2018 with the EasyCare range of paints.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2018/07/27/1543404/0/en/Low-Odor-Paint-Offers-a-Healthier-Solution-for-Your-Home.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The multinational company [[Tarkett]] specialised in the production of floor has also passed the scientific standards to be certified and offers various ranges of flooring certified asthma &amp; allergy friendly®.&lt;ref&gt; https://residential.tarkett.com/en_US/node/asthma-allergy-friendly-1945&lt;/ref&gt;

[[LG]] has also get the asthma &amp; allergy friendly® certification for a large range of products including washing machines, air purifiers and clothing steam systems. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.lg.com/us/aafa&lt;/ref&gt;

Nowadays most manufacturers of engineered stone use this patented Bretonstone system, also known as vibro-compression under vacuum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Impelluso|first1=Thomas J.|title=Italian Machines That Make Machines|url=http://mechanical.sdsu.edu/sdsu_newscenter/news.aspx?s=72126|website=mechanical.sdsu.edu|publisher=San Diego State University - NewsCenter|accessdate=15 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==


In the early-1970s Marcello Toncelli,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Marcello Toncelli Biography|url=http://www.blurb.com/b/534441-marcello-toncelli|accessdate=15 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; founder of Breton, started developing the Bretonstone system, which allows to produce a [[solid surface]] similar to granite, using small stone aggregates and stone-like materials. The composite material is manufactured in slabs, which can be worked as natural stone, instead of blocks that should have been cut.

Basically the vibro-compression vacuum technology,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of the Breton Process|url=http://www.sitesnsolutions.com/Articles/History%20of%20Breton%20Process.htm|website=www.sitesnsolutions.com/|accessdate=15 July 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120724051909/http://sitesnsolutions.com/Articles/History%20of%20Breton%20Process.htm#|archive-date=2012-07-24|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Compound stones in general|url=http://kuterinvestment.com/documents/en/41/41/compound-stone|website=kuterinvestment.com/|publisher=Kuter - Industrial investment business development|accessdate=15 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; used by Bretonstone system, consists of blending the natural aggregate of stone with a [[polymer]] mix (usually unsaturated polyester [[resin]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Govoni|first1=Paola|title=New generation materials|url=http://www.csilmilano.com/CSILrepec-articles/WF47p34.pdf|website=www.csilmilano.com/|publisher=Centre for industrial studies|accessdate=15 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; taking away air with a vacuum, and catalyzing the molded product whilst vibrating and applying pressure to this mix. Then the mixture is heated, and the output is a slab of non-porous and quite stable engineered stone.

The following improvements led the agglomerated stone to obtain the same hardness as granite, when siliceous stone or [[quartz]] were added in the mix.

The [[agglomerate]] produced with the Bretonstone system looks like natural stone and varies in look according to the types of stone aggregates and stone-like materials used in the process:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Quartz: the world turns grey|url=http://www.naturalstonespecialist.com/currentissue/unlockednewsarticle.php?id=4427|website=www.naturalstonespecialist.com/|publisher=Natural Stone Specialist|accessdate=15 July 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141018181201/http://www.naturalstonespecialist.com/currentissue/unlockednewsarticle.php?id=4427|archivedate=18 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Availability==
The movie was released on videocassette in 1989 by New World. The tape itself is notable for having trailers for the films ''[[Warlock (1989 film)|Warlock]]'' and ''[[The Punisher (1989 film)|The Punisher]]'', both of which were passed on to separate studios after New World fell into [[bankruptcy]]. In 1991, Starmaker Video released a tape in the EP Mode. A DVD has been released in Australia, but as of December 22, 2009, no plans for a Region 1 DVD have been announced.

The '''European Chemical Site Promotion Platform (ECSPP)''' was founded in 2005 to promote new investments in [[Europe]]'s [[chemical industry|chemical industrial]] complexes.

==Origins==
The idea of ECSPP was developed at the 2002 [[European Petrochemical Association]] (EPCA) Annual Meeting in [[Berlin]] between Peter Anderton of the [[Port of Rotterdam]] and Neil Kenley of SembCorp Utilities UK Ltd.

One of the conclusions emerging from this discussion was that European chemical sites could benefit from having a forum where information and insights on matters of common interest could be exchanged. In particular, it was felt that Europe needed to be more pro-active in profiling itself as an attractive region for new chemical investment.

==Brainstorming session==
In November 2003, Peter Anderton invited a number of chemical site management organizations to [[Rotterdam]] to take part in a brainstorming session to determine whether there was wider support for setting up such a forum, to be known as European Chemical Site Promotion Platform (ECSPP). There was enthusiastic backing for the idea and it was decided to develop the framework and conditions required to establish ECSPP as a formal organization.

==Steering committee==
A [[steering committee]] was formed to manage this process and in the course of 2004, a [[Business Plan]] was drafted. At a plenary meeting in March 2005, the Business Plan was approved unanimously and the decision was taken to proceed with the formal establishment of ECSPP.

ECSPP was officially launched at a Press Conference held during EPCA's Annual Meeting in September 2005 in [[Vienna]].

The [[Northeast of England Process Industry Cluster]] are members of ECSPP.

(Counselling) degree from La Trobe University, Eve worked for the Federal Government as a [[psychologist]] and trainer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=From science to worldwide film success|url=https://www.monash.edu/__data/assets/pdf_file/0003/65361/eve-ash.pdf|website=Monash University|publisher=Monash University|accessdate=17 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eve subsequently founded her business Seven Dimensions in 1979, with the mission of self-financing and producing [[comedy]] business films. She has two children.

In 2008, many years after her parents died, Eve uncovered a family secret that compelled her to “rewrite” her own life. After the results of DNA testing, Eve discovered that she was in fact the love-child of a long-standing clandestine affair. Her biological father was alive and well, working full-time as Australia’s oldest land surveyor. The story forms the basis of Eve’s documentary series ''Family Secrets'' - due for release in 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Horsburgh|first1=Susan|title=This family secret lasted 60 years|url=http://www.nowtolove.com.au/celebrity/celeb-news/this-family-secret-lasted-60-years-9968|accessdate=17 August 2017|publisher=Women's Weekly|date=19 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <comment>Flexplace is not another word for Telecommuting or Teleworking.  It is a policy that allows flexibility and choice of place. Allowing a person to choose to work in a different desk in their office is a form of Flexplace.</comment>

'''Flexplace '''(can include [[telecommuting]]) refers to a [[Policy|company policy]] or program that enables [[employee]]s to have more authority on where they will work regardless of time of day. It can be the result of a formal agreement between the employer and the employee or it can simply entail the fact that a job can be performed in any context or place. For example, an employee may choose to work in the office or from home or from a client's office or even a [[café]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://workingmoms.about.com/od/workschedule/f/What-Is-Flexplace.htm|title=What Is Flexplace?|author=Katherine Lewis|work=About.com|accessdate=April 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is the workplace equivalent of the workforce policy of [[flextime]] and flexbenefits.

== Benefits ==
Flexplace has multiple benefits, for both the company and the employee. For organizations, it offers the chance of reducing its carbon footprint, through reduced energy consumption, reduced travel costs and parking spaces. For individuals, flexplace schemes have improved performance and productivity as well as an improved supervisor/worker relationship, morale and job attitude.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.dau.mil/pubscats/PubsCats/PM/articles01/washj-f.pdf|title=Telecommuting Program – Is "Flexplace" Suited to Your Organization?|author=William N.

==Work==
Jones initially researched relationships between business and governments. He published historical monographs on the oil industry&lt;ref name="Jones1981"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Geoffrey Jones|title=The State and the Emergence of the British Oil Industry|year=1981|publisher=MacMillan Press|isbn=0-333-27595-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; and international banking.&lt;ref name="JonesJones1986"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Geoffrey Jones|title=Banking and Empire in Iran|year=1986|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-32322-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the 1980s, Jones, alongside [[Mark Casson]], was also involved in calling for a more theoretical approach to business history, particularly in the use of [[economic theory]].&lt;ref name="JonesZeitlin2008"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Geoffrey Jones|author2=Jonathan Zeitlin|title=The Oxford Handbook of Business History|year=2008|publisher=Oxford Handbooks Online|isbn=978-0-19-926368-4|page=61}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this period he wrote historical studies of industries over long time periods, including ''British Multinational Banking 1830-1990'' (Oxford, 1993)&lt;ref name="Jones1993"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Geoffrey Jones|title=British Multinational Banking|year=1993|publisher=Clarendon Press|isbn=0-19-820602-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Merchants to Multinationals'' (Oxford, 2000).&lt;ref name="JonesJones2000"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Geoffrey Jones|title=Merchants to Multinationals|year=2000|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-924999-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Merchants to Multinationals'' was awarded the Newcomen-Harvard Prize for the best business history book published in the United States between 1998 and 2000, and the Wadsworth Prize for the best work of business history published in Britain in 2000. After moving to Harvard Business School, Jones published books on the history of global business, including ''Multinationals and Global Capitalism'' (Oxford, 2005).&lt;ref name="Jones2005"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Geoffrey Jones|title=Multinationals and Global Capitalism|year=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-927210-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, Jones published ''Beauty Imagined: A History of the Global Beauty Industry'' (Oxford, 2010).&lt;ref name=Jones2010&gt;{{cite book|author1=Geoffrey Jones|author2=Bee Wilson|title=Beauty Imagined: A History of the Global Beauty Industry|publisher=Oxford University Press|date=2010|isbn=978-0199556496}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this book, and elsewhere,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bigthink.com/experts/geoffjones |title=Geoff Jones |publisher=Big Think |accessdate=16 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jones has sought both to explain the growth of the beauty industry and to explore its impact over the last century on homogenizing beauty ideals worldwide. Recently Jones has focused on the history of green business and [[sustainability]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zkYeuVoo1M |title=The Importance of Green Business, AIB Conference, Nagoya, 2011 |via=YouTube |date=15 February 2013 |accessdate=16 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has written on the societal responsibilities of capitalism.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Publication%20Files/14-004_2fbc7e4e-09a2-4c52-9b15-910b43fa0d5b.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the Creating Emerging Markets project, he has also researched the business history of emerging markets, especially Latin America&lt;ref name="JonesLluch2015"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Geoffrey Jones|author2=Andrea Lluch|title=The Impact of Globalization on Argentina and Chile.

In 2006 he and [[Tarun Khanna]] published a widely cited article in the [[Journal of International Business Studies]], the premier international business journal, on this issue.&lt;ref name="JonesKhanna2006"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Geoffrey Jones|author2=Tarun Khanna|year= 2006|title=Bringing History (back) to International Business|journal=Journal of International Business Studies|volume=37|issue=4|pages=453–468|doi=10.1057/palgrave.jibs.8400198}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently Jones and Khanna have published on the importance of corporate reputation in emerging markets, employing data from the Creating Emerging Markets project.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Harvard Business School|title=Overcoming institutional voids to succeed in emerging markets|date=6 March 2017|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWq2eSXgdC0|accessdate=7 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jones has warned of the risks to the world economy of economic nationalism and [[populism]].&lt;ref name="Brexitisjustthelatestblowtoglobalization"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Belsie|first1=Lauren|title=Brexit is just the latest blow to globalization|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Europe/2016/0627/Brexit-is-just-the-latest-blow-to-globalization|accessdate=5 March 2017|work=[[The Christian Science Monitor]]|date=27 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, Jones suggested the world economy was undergoing a process of de-globalization.&lt;ref name="mintweareinadeglobalization"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Agarwal|first1=Sapna|last2=Raje|first2=Aparna Piramal|title=We are in a deglobalization period: Business historian Geoffrey G.

'''George Fitzhugh''' (November 4, 1806 – July 30, 1881) was an American social theorist who published racial and slavery-based sociological theories in the [[antebellum era]]. He argued that the negro "is but a grown up child"&lt;ref&gt;Fitzhugh, George (1854). [https://archive.org/stream/sociologyforsou00fitz#page/82/mode/2up "Negro Slavery"], ''Sociology for the South'', Chap. V, A. Morris Publisher, p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aia/part4/4h3141t.html "George Fitzhugh Advocates Slavery"], ''The Black American: A Documentary History'', Foresman and Company, Illinois, 1976, 1970.&lt;!-- ISBN, page(s) needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; who needs the economic and social protections of slavery. Fitzhugh decried capitalism as spawning "a war of the rich with the poor, and the poor with one another"&lt;ref&gt;Fitzhugh (1854), p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;– rendering free blacks "far outstripped or outwitted in the chase of free competition."&lt;ref&gt;Fitzhugh (1854), p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt; Slavery, he contended, ensured that blacks would be economically secure and morally civilized.

Fitzhugh practiced law and was a painter for years, but attracted both fame and infamy when he published two sociological tracts for the South. He was a leading [[pro-slavery]] intellectual&lt;ref&gt;[[Drew Faust Gilpin|Gilpin, Drew Faust]] (1977). ''A Sacred Circle: The Dilemma of the Intellectual in the Old South, 1840–1860'', Johns Hopkins University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and spoke for many of the Southern plantation owners. Before printing books, Fitzhugh tried his hand at a pamphlet titled "Slavery Justified" (1849). His first book, ''Sociology for the South'' (1854) was not as widely known as his second book, ''Cannibals All!'' (1857). ''Sociology for the South'' is the first known English-language book to include the term "[[sociology]]" in its title.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.walkercountyhistory.org/oakwood_cemetery.php Oakwood Cemetery, Walker County Historical Society website]; accessed August 27, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fitzhugh differed from nearly all of his southern contemporaries by advocating a slavery that crossed racial boundaries. In 1860 Fitzhugh stated that "It is a libel on white men to say they are unfit for slavery" and suggested that if [[Yankee]]s were caught young they could be trained, domesticated and civilized to make "faithful and valuable servants".&lt;ref&gt;George Fitzhugh. ''[[Horace Greeley]] and his Lost Book'', [[Southern Literary Messenger]] Volume 31, Issue 3, 1860.&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in the ''Richmond Inquirer'' on 15 December 1855, Fitzhugh proclaimed: "The principle of slavery is in itself right, and does not depend on difference of complexion", "Nature has made the weak in mind or body slaves&amp;nbsp; ... The wise and virtuous, the strong in body and mind, are born to command", and "The Declaration of Independence is exuberantly false, and aborescently fallacious."&lt;ref&gt;"Brown here quotes from the work of the southern proslavery writer George Fitzhugh, though it is clear that Brown is taking these quotations from published accounts of Fitzhugh's work that appeared in the antislavery press." — Brown, William Wells (2011). ''My Southern Home: The South and Its People: The South and Its People'', Chap. XV, University of North Carolina Press (footnote).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
George Fitzhugh was born on November 4, 1806, to George Fitzhugh Sr. (a surgeon/physician) and Lucy (née Stuart) Fitzhugh. He was born in [[Prince William County, Virginia]]. His family moved to [[Alexandria, Virginia]], when he was six. He attended public school though his career was built on self-education. He married Mary Metcalf Brockenbrough in 1829 and moved to [[Port Royal, Virginia]]. There he began his own law business. Fitzhugh took up residence in a "rickety old mansion" known for a vast collection of bats in its attic that he inherited through his wife's family. He was something of a recluse in this home for most of his life and rarely travelled away from it for extended periods of time, spending most of his days there engaged in unguided reading from a vast library of books and pamphlets.

Of the writers in his library, Fitzhugh's beliefs were most heavily influenced by [[Thomas Carlyle]], whom he read frequently and referenced in many of his works.&lt;ref&gt;Straka, Gerald M. (1957). "The Spirit of Carlyle in the Old South," ''The Historian'' '''20''' (1), pp. 39–57.&lt;/ref&gt; Atypical for a slavery advocate, Fitzhugh also subscribed to and regularly read abolitionist pamphlets such as ''[[The Liberator (anti-slavery newspaper)|The Liberator]]''. He made only one major visit to other parts of the nation in the entire antebellum period – an 1855 journey to the north where he met and argued with abolitionists [[Gerrit Smith]] and [[Wendell Phillips]].

Never politically active in his own right, Fitzhugh managed to find the company of well known political figures in his day.&lt;ref&gt;Hartz, Louis (1955). ''The Liberal Tradition in America: An Interpretation of American Political Thought Since the Revolution''. New York: Harcourt, Brace &amp; World, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the two abolitionists, Fitzhugh was an acquaintance of several public officials. In 1857 Fitzhugh served as a law clerk in Washington, D.C. under [[Attorney General]] [[Jeremiah Sullivan Black]]. He gained fairly wide circulation in print, writing articles for several Virginia newspapers and for the widely circulated Southern magazine ''[[DeBow's Review]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Leland, Charles G. (1862). [http://ebooks.library.cornell.edu/cgi/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=cont;cc=cont;g=moagrp;xc=1;q1=George%20Fitzhugh;rgn=full%20text;view=image;seq=0486;idno=cont0002-4;node=cont0002-4%3A16 "A Southern Review,"] ''The Continental Monthly'' '''2''' (4), pp. 466–469.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Skipper, Ottis Clark (1958). ''J.D.B. De Bow: Magazinist of the old South''. Athens, Ga.: University of Georgia Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

After moving to [[Richmond, Virginia]], in 1862 he began to work in the Treasury of the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]]. After the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], Fitzhugh spent a short time judging for the [[Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen and Abandoned Lands|Freedmen's Court]] and then retiring to [[Kentucky]] after his wife's death in 1877. He later moved to his daughter's residence in [[Huntsville, Texas]], where he died on July 30, 1881.  He is buried in a grave in [[Oakwood Cemetery (Huntsville, Texas)|Oakwood Cemetery]], Huntsville, where his daughter, Mariella Fitzhugh Foster and her husband Capt. Marcellus Aurelius Foster are also buried.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.encyclopediavirginia.org/Fitzhugh_George_1806-1881#start_entry George Fitzhugh (1806–1881)] Encyclopedia of Virginia website.

==Writings==
===''Sociology for the South''===
''Sociology for the South, or, the Failure of Free Society'' (1854) was George Fitzhugh's most powerful attack on the philosophical foundations of free society. In it, he took on not only [[Adam Smith]],&lt;ref&gt;Dodd, William E. (1920). [https://archive.org/stream/chroniclesameric27john#page/n13/mode/2up ''The Cotton Kingdom: A Chronicle of the Old South''], Yale University Press, p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt; the foundational thinker of capitalism, but also [[John Locke]],&lt;ref&gt;Loewenberg, Robert (1985). "John Locke and the Antebellum Defense of Slavery," ''Political Theory'' '''13''' (2), pp. 266–291.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Jefferson]], and the entire liberal tradition. He argued that free labor and free markets enriched the strong while crushing the weak.&lt;ref&gt;Fitzhugh (1854), p. 179.&lt;/ref&gt; What society needed, he wrote, was slavery, not just for blacks, but for whites as well. "Slavery," he wrote, "is a form, and the very best form, of socialism."&lt;ref&gt;Fitzhugh (1854), pp. 27–28.&lt;/ref&gt; "Socialism," he continued:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Proposes to do away with free competition; to afford protection and support at all times to the laboring class; to bring about, at least, a qualified community of property, and to associate labor. All these purposes, slavery fully and perfectly attains. ... Socialism is already slavery in all save the master ... Our only quarrel with Socialism is, that it will not honestly admit that it owes its recent revival to the failure of universal liberty, and is seeking to bring about slavery again in some form.&lt;ref&gt;Fitzhugh (1854), pp. 48, 70.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Fitzhugh believed that slavery reduced the pressure on the poor and lower classes; in other words, he advocated slavery for poor whites as well as blacks.&lt;ref&gt;Craven, Avery (1944). [https://archive.org/stream/papersinillinois1942illi#page/n13/mode/2up "Southern Attitudes Toward Abrahan Lincoln,"] ''Papers in Illinois History and Transactions for the year 1942'', The Illinois State Historical Society, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; He also strongly opposed the racial doctrines of the time.&lt;ref&gt;"We abhor the doctrine of the "Types of Mankind;" first, because it is at war with scripture, which teaches us that the whole human race is descended from a common parentage; and, secondly, because it encourages and incites brutal masters to treat negroes, not as weak, ignorant and dependent brethren, but as wicked beasts,
without the pale of humanity. The Southerner is the negro's friend, his only friend. Let no intermeddling abolitionist, no refined philosophy, dissolve this friendship." — Fitzhugh (1854), p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Cannibals All!''===
''Cannibals All!, or Slaves Without Masters'' (1857) was a critique further developing the themes that Fitzhugh had introduced in ''Sociology for the South.'' Both the book's title and its subtitle were phrases taken from the writing of [[Thomas Carlyle]], the [[Scottish people|Scottish]] social critic and a great hero to Fitzhugh's generation of proslavery thinkers.&lt;ref&gt;Dodd, William E. (1918). [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2764032 "The Social Philosophy of the Old South,"] ''American Journal of Sociology'' '''23''' (6), pp. 735–746.&lt;/ref&gt; The aim of his book, Fitzhugh claimed, was to show that "the unrestricted exploitation of so-called free society is more oppressive to the laborer than domestic slavery."&lt;ref&gt;Fitzhugh (1857), [https://archive.org/stream/cannibalsallorsll00fitz#page/n13/mode/2up ''Preface''], p. ix.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Cannibals All!'' was a sharp criticism of the system of "[[wage-slavery]]" found in the north.&lt;ref&gt;Persky, Joseph (1992). "Unequal Exchange and Dependency Theory in George Fitzhugh," ''History of Political Economy'' '''24''' (1), pp. 117–128.&lt;/ref&gt; Fitzhugh's ideas were based on his view that the "negro slaves of the South" were considerably more free than those trapped by the oppression of capitalist exploitation.&lt;ref&gt;Woodward, C. Vann (1964). "A Southern War Against Capitalism." In: ''American Counterpoint: Slavery and racism in the North-South Dialogue''. Boston: Little, Brown and Company, pp. 107–139.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wiener, Jonathan M. (1979). "Coming to Terms with Capitalism: The Postwar Thought of George Fitzhugh," ''The Virginia Magazine of History and Biography'' '''87''' (4), pp. 438–447.&lt;/ref&gt; His idea to rectify social inequality created by capitalism&lt;ref&gt;Dowling, David (2009). "'Other and More Terrible Evils': Anticapitalist Rhetoric in Harriet Wilson's 'Our Nig' and Proslavery Propaganda," ''College Literature'' '''36''' (3), pp. 116–136.&lt;/ref&gt; was to institute a system of universal slavery, based on his belief that "nineteen out of every twenty individuals have ... a natural and inalienable right to be slaves."&lt;ref&gt;Fitzhugh (1857), p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt; Under this same context, Fitzhugh asserted that society was obligated to protect the weak by controlling and subjugating them. Fitzhugh wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;'It is the duty of society to protect the weak;' but protection cannot be efficient without the power of control; therefore, 'It is the duty of society to enslave the weak.'&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title= Cannibals All!, or Slaves Without Masters | author=George Fitzhugh | location= Richmond: VA| publisher=A. Morris Publishers |date=1857 |page=278.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Fitzhugh's ideas in ''Cannibals All!'', while often used in the defense of anti-abolition, have a more socially egalitarian undertone which attempted to remedy inequalities in "Property of man."&lt;ref&gt;Sklansky, Jeffrey P. (2002). ''The Soul's Economy: Market Society and Selfhood in American Thought, 1820–1920'', University of North Carolina Press.&lt;/ref&gt; His ideas of reform could be seen in terms of a non-Marxist socialist ideology.&lt;ref&gt;Frazier, Mark C. (1974). [http://www.unz.org/Pub/Reason-1974feb-00024 "Slavery and Socialism: Our Brothers' Keepers,"] ''Reason'' '''5''' (10), pp. 24–27.&lt;/ref&gt; The extremes advocated by Fitzhugh's writing led even some of his allies to denounce his bold claims.

''Cannibals All!'' garnered more attention in the ''[[The Liberator (anti-slavery newspaper)|Liberator]]'', [[William Lloyd Garrison]]'s abolitionist newspaper, than any other book. Lincoln is said to have been more angered by George Fitzhugh than by any other pro-slavery writer, yet he unconsciously paraphrased ''Cannibals All!'' in his [[Lincoln's House Divided Speech|House Divided speech]].&lt;ref&gt;Phillips, Michael (2007). "George Fitzhugh (1806-1881)." In: Junius P. Rodriguez (ed.), ''Slavery in the United States: A Social, Political, and Historical Encyclopedia'', Vol. I, ABC-CLIO, p. 285.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Harrington Emerson''' (August 2, 1853 – September 2, 1931) was an American [[Management consulting|efficiency engineer]] and [[business theorist]],&lt;ref name="HEP"&gt;[http://www.libraries.psu.edu/findingaids/1541.htm Harrington Emerson Papers, 1848-1931] at Penn State.&lt;/ref&gt; who founded the management consultancy firm Emerson Institute in New York City in 1900. Known for his pioneering contributions to [[scientific management]],&lt;ref&gt;Kreis (1992: 156)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kipping &amp; Clark (2012, p. 33)&lt;/ref&gt; Emerson may have done more than anyone else to popularize the topic:&lt;ref name="Drury, p. 129"&gt;Drury, p. 129&lt;/ref&gt; his public testimony in 1910 to the [[Interstate Commerce Commission]] that the railroads could save $1,000,000 a day started a nationwide interest in the subject of "efficiency".

== Biography ==
Emerson was born in [[Trenton, New Jersey]] to Edwin Emerson, a Professor of Political science,&lt;ref name="HBD 1918"&gt;Drury (1918, p. 125-126)&lt;/ref&gt; and Mary Louisa (Ingham) Emerson, daughter of [[Samuel D. Ingham]], a U.S. Congressman and U.S. Treasury Secretary under President [[Andrew Jackson]]. Emerson attended private schools in Europe, and from 1872 to 1875 studied engineering at the [[Technical University Munich]].&lt;ref name="HEP"/&gt;
[[File:Harrington Emerson.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Emerson, 1916]]
After returning to the United States in 1876, Emerson was appointed as Professor of Modern Languages at the [[University of Nebraska]], where he was dismissed in 1882 because of his progressive educational ideas. In the years after, Harrington had several jobs, including a frontier banker, land speculator, tax agent, troubleshooter, lecturer, and educator. In 1893, he joined [[William Jennings Bryan]]'s campaign for the presidential election of 1896, which created the foundation for his career as efficiency engineer.&lt;ref name="HEP"/&gt;

In 1897, Emerson started focusing on [[mechanical engineering]], and was employed shortly after by the [[Exide|Electric Storage Battery Company]] in New York. After his new projects during the [[Alaskan Gold Rush]] failed, he became the general manager in a small glass factory. In 1900, he established the Emerson Institute in New York City in order to focus on his work as efficiency engineer. Through the [[American Society of Mechanical Engineers]], he got acquainted with the work of [[Frederick Winslow Taylor|Frederick W. Taylor]], which he implemented in his own praxis.&lt;ref name="HEP"/&gt;

Emerson was married to Mary Crawford Suplee, and the youngest of their three daughters was the American painter [[Louise Emerson Ronnebeck]] (1901 – 1980).

== Work ==

=== The ideal of setting up of standards ===
Emerson had spent his youth in Europe. It was to French character, and to German military efficiency as evidenced before his eyes in the conduct of the [[Franco-Prussian War]], that Emerson attributes his strongest ideal — the setting up of [[Standard operating procedure|standards]]. His admiration for systematic method and perfect cooperation was further strengthened by studies under a European music teacher (a musician from the royal orchestra), by observation of the remarkable results obtained by breeders of fine horses, and by contact with A. B. Smith, a skilful railroad surveyor.&lt;ref name="HBD 1918"/&gt;

=== Earlier efforts in the field of systematizing management ===
Emerson's earlier efforts in the field of systematizing [[management]] were in organizing and standardizing one of the new western state universities, the [[University of Nebraska]], of which for six years he was registrar, secretary of the faculty, and head of a department. It was not until some years after this that he entered the profession of reorganizing [[industrial plant]]s.&lt;ref name="HBD 1918"/&gt;

In 1895 he began a rapid survey of these, determining what their product and costs were compared to what they ought to be. In 1900 or 1902, he checked up minutely the losses occurring in the use of materials, while planning, scheduling, and dispatching work through a large factory.&lt;ref name="HBD 1918"/&gt;

Of all Emerson's undertakings, however, that which has attracted the most attention was his "betterment work" introduced into the shops of the [[Santa Fe Railway]] during three years beginning in 1904. He has installed his system partially, though in no instance completely, in some 200 different plants from Alaska to Mexico, from Louisiana to Canada, from Southern California to Maine. These activities were carried on through the Emerson Company, which late 1910s employs between forty and fifty efficiency specialists.&lt;ref name="HBD 1918"/&gt;

=== Betterment work ===
[[File:Santa Fe shop, Topeka Kansas painting cars.JPG|thumb|Santa Fe shop, [[Topeka, Kansas]] painting cars around 1900-1930.]]
In May, 1904, because of [[Strike action|labor troubles]], Harrington Emerson was given the task of reorganizing certain features of the [[Sante Fe railway]] system. His authority extended only to that one department known as the motive power department; and he was, therefore, concerned mainly with the maintenance and repair of [[locomotive]]s, much of which work was centralized in shops at Topeka. Nevertheless, by the time Emerson had worked out from Topeka to the end of the 10,000 or so miles of road, his system was affecting 12,000 men, and he had a task upon his hands which took three years of time, and the assistance of a large staff of railway experts.&lt;ref name="Drury, p. 140-2"&gt;Drury, p. 140-142&lt;/ref&gt;

The cause of starting Emerson's "betterment work" as it was officially called, having been a strike, his first and most important aim was to establish a basis for permanent harmony by introducing an "individual effort and [[Performance-related pay|bonus system]]." Increased supervision of the men was to be undertaken, and for good work special rewards were to be given. Accordingly, [[Time and motion study|time studies]] were made (about 60,000 by March, 1907), tasks were set, and bonuses offered. There were several distinguishing features which marked this phase of [[scientific management]] as it was introduced on the Santa Fe:
* First, extreme emphasis was laid on the individual character of the relations of men and management: "The schedule is a moral contract or agreement with the men as to a particular machine operation, rate of wages and time. Any change in men [etc.] calls for a new schedule."&lt;ref&gt;''Studies in History, Economics, and Public Law''. Vol. 65.  p. 401. 1915.&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Second, there was a lack of insistence on the selection of unusual men: "The standard time set is reasonable, and one that can be reached without extraordinary effort; is, in fact, such time as a good foreman would demand."&lt;ref&gt;Emerson (1905, p. 61)&lt;/ref&gt; 
* And third, bonuses were paid to foremen. Thus the Santa Fe management sought to make of its employees industrious, well paid, and loyal workmen.&lt;ref name="Drury, p. 140-2"/&gt; 
[[File:Planning department bulletin board, 1911.jpg|thumb|Planning department bulletin, showing how, under Scientific Management, the work for each man or each machine is mapped out in advance, 1911.]]
But before actually setting tasks, it was necessary to study and standardize all tools and equipment, and this led in itself to important improvements. Specially notable was the improvement in the care of belting, this being taken out of the hands of the workmen and put into those of specialists, with a resulting saving of 70 per cent in the expense of belt maintenance. Perhaps the most interesting features which Emerson introduced were the various routing and scheduling devices. All of the work in the [[machine shop]] was so arranged that it could be controlled from dispatch boards located in a central office; likewise on a bulletin board was indicated the progress in the repair of each locomotive. Most of the other changes — such as the centralization of work at Topeka, and the introduction of improved methods of [[cost accounting]] — are beyond the pale of things which are distinctively "scientific management."&lt;ref name="Drury, p. 140-2"/&gt;

It is agreed that the principles of scientific management were only part of them introduced on the Santa Fe. Nevertheless, the estimated savings were at the time put at enormous figures. Thus in the article from which the above quotations were taken, its writer estimated from figures contained in the president's annual report that during the fiscal year ending June 31, 1906, fully a million and half quarter of dollars were saved. Other critics were equally enthusiastic, and the work attracted a great deal of attention throughout the country.&lt;ref name="Drury, p. 140-2"/&gt;

=== Emerson's system of efficiency and scientific management ===
Emerson distinguished his system from [[scientific management]] based on three characteristics:&lt;ref name="Drury, p. 126-7"&gt;Drury, p. 126-127&lt;/ref&gt;  
[[File:Record of efficiency and costs in locomotive repairs, 1905-09.jpg|thumb|Record of efficiency and costs in locomotive repairs by Emerson, 1912]]
# He calls his system "efficiency" rather than "scientific management." 
# He opposed [[functional management]] with its numerous heads, and substitutes for it the "line and staff" idea, under which there is but one boss (the line). The functional experts (or staff) whom Emerson employs are not executive officers, but simply advise the single responsible authority; and it is the latter who puts all plans into practice through command over his "line" subordinates. The idea is to avoid creating too many bosses, and yet operate under expert advice. 
# Emerson uses a [[wage system]] which bases remuneration partly upon the "efficiency per cent" of the employee. Standard times are set on the basis of time study analysis, and the workman who just completes the same in the allotted time is credited with 100 per cent efficiency.

Efficiency may thus be reckoned as below, above, or at 100 per cent. Although everyone receives his day rate, which is supposed to be a normal compensation when compared with prevailing wages, a man who cannot attain 66.7 per cent efficiency in the long run is regarded as subnormal and is in danger of discharge. At 67 per cent a small bonus is paid, which grows in size until at 90 per cent efficiency it reaches 10 per cent. Above this point one per cent in bonus is added for each additional one per cent gain in efficiency.&lt;ref name="Drury, p. 126-7"/&gt;

Emerson has thus developed a [[wage system]] which is in its results practically the same as Gantt's "task and bonus" plan, except that under the Gantt system no bonus is paid until a man comes up to standard performance, in the hope that the large increase then suddenly granted will bring all up to a common productivity.&lt;ref name="Drury, p. 126-7"/&gt;

=== Emerson and Frederick W. Taylor ===
Emerson was nearly three years older than [[Frederick Winslow Taylor|Frederick W. Taylor]]; he did not meet the latter until December, 1900, and the two never worked together. Emerson was present, however, when Taylor's "Shop Management" was read, in 1903, and did almost all of his mature work in the light (if he chose to use it) of that exposition.&lt;ref name="Drury, p. 127-8"&gt;Drury, p. 127-128&lt;/ref&gt;

As regards his general thought, Emerson has received stimuli from many sources; but as concerns the application of efficiency to industrial plants, there is good ground for believing that he is much more deeply indebted to Taylor than to any other. Indeed, men well acquainted with both have told us that Emerson was once accustomed to refer to Taylor as the source of his ideas: Taylor he regarded as trying to do too much, as being in advance of his time; it was he, Emerson, who, by rendering lofty projects more practical, was able to achieve results.&lt;ref name="Drury, p. 127-8"/&gt;

On the other hand, it cannot be denied that Emerson has brought into the field a great deal of original force. He may have adopted some of Taylor's ideas; but if so, his conduct is similar to the appropriation which every man makes of any scheme that appeals to him as useful; and beyond this, he has at the same time combined them with so many ideas derived from other sources that his resulting philosophical 
system is a truly original contribution to the subject. Certainly in his books he has expressed himself in a way which is in many respects far more effective than the style of the other scientific management or efficiency men.&lt;ref name="Drury, p. 127-8"/&gt;

== Reception ==
According to Drury (1918) Emerson has done more than any other single man to popularize the subject of [[scientific management]].&lt;ref name="Drury, p. 129"&gt;Drury, p. 129&lt;/ref&gt; His statement that the railroads could save $1,000,000 a day by introducing efficiency methods was the keynote which started the nationwide interest in the subject. His books, ''Efficiency'' (a reprint in 1911 of periodical contributions of 1908 and 1909), and ''The Twelve Principles of Efficiency'' (1912), taken with his magazine articles and addresses, have perhaps done more than anything else to make "efficiency" a household word.&lt;ref name="Drury, p. 129"/&gt;

In "A short history of efficiency" [[Morgen Witzel|Witzel]] (2002) summarized Emerson's role and ideas. He stated, that Emerson had "argued that an efficient organisation was a necessary prerequisite to task and process efficiency. Rejecting the machine metaphor of [[scientific management]], Emerson conceived of an organic organisation where efficiency was a natural occurrence, not an imposed set of targets and procedures - a concept that has a lot in common with [[total quality management]] and a management philosophy that remains valid and important."&lt;ref name="Wi 2002"&gt;Witzel (2002, 38)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Juan Eugenio Serrallés Colón'''&lt;ref group=note&gt;{{Spanish name|'''Serrallés'''|'''Colón'''|plain=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1836&lt;ref&gt;[https://cdn.loc.gov/master/pnp/habshaer/pr/pr0000/pr0094/data/pr0094data.pdf ''Hacienda Mercedita Foundry, Barrio Sabanestas(sic), Municipality of Ponce, Puerto Rico: Photographs, Written Historical and Descriptive Data.''] Benjamin Nistal-Moret, Hector Sanchez and Jean Yearby. Historic American Engineering Record. HAER Number PR-8. U. S. National Park Service, Department of the Interior, Washington, D. C. 20240. 1984. Accessed 18 April 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;–1921) was the founder of [[Hacienda Mercedita]] in [[Ponce, Puerto Rico]] and what was to become [[Destileria Serralles]], producers of "[[Ron Don Q|Don Q]]", a brand of [[Rum|Puerto Rican rum]].

==Family and early years==
Juan Serrallés Colón, born in Ponce, Puerto Rico, was the son of Sebastian Serrallés, a wealthy [[Spaniard]] from [[Catalonia]] who settled in Ponce in the early 19th century and went into the [[sugarcane]] business, and Juana Colon.  Serrallés Colón was the owner of "''Hacienda Mercedita''" as well as the neighboring Hacienda Fe and Hacienda Laurel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.destileriaserralles.com/story Our Story:] Destileria Serralles&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://cdn.loc.gov/master/pnp/habshaer/pr/pr0000/pr0094/data/pr0094data.pdf Hacienda Mercedita]: Foundry Barrio Sabanestas, Municipality of Ponce, Puerto Rico&lt;/ref&gt;

Juan Serrallés was raised in Ponce and educated in [[Spain]].  When Juan Serrallés returned to the island, he returned to lead the work in his hacienda ([[Sugar plantations in the Caribbean|plantation]]).&lt;ref name="Don Q"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=l6ex-yW0Ds8C&amp;pg=PA99 ''Rum: The Epic Story Of The Drink That Conquered The World.''] Charles A. Coulombe. Citadel Books. New York: Kensington Publishing Corp. Page 99. Retrieved 26 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

=="Don Q" rum==
In 1865, Juan imported a [[still]] which he purchased in [[France]] and produced his first few casks of [[rum]].  He named the rum ''[[Don Q]]'' in honor of the legendary Spanish fictional character [[Don Quixote]].  Soon after, the "Don Q" brand of rum became very popular in Puerto Rico and the family business began to grow.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jmc.ou.edu/CommCulture/Lindsey%20Chase.htm ''A Spirited Tradition.''] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120718224508/http://jmc.ou.edu/CommCulture/Lindsey%20Chase.htm |date=2012-07-18 }} Chase Lindsey. University of Oklahoma. Gaylord College of Journalism. Retrieved 26 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1903 the Serrallés family, under the leadership of Juan Serrallés, installed the first continuous still in Puerto Rico.  Juan Serrallés died in 1921 just as the production of rum was being halted because of the [[United States]] [[Prohibition]] Act of the 1920s.  Juan's family continued to run the sugar side of the business but for the destillery side started to produce medical [[alcohol]] instead of the outlawed rum. It was called ''Alcoholado Superior 70''.

==Personal life==
[[Image:Castillo Serralles.JPG|right|200px|thumb|The Serralles Castle, built by Juan's son, Juan Eugenio Serralles Perez in the 1930s]]
Juan Serrallés Colón married Mercedes Perez (1845–1922), after whom he named his sugar plantation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geni.com/people/Mercedes-Pérez-de-Serrallés/301625841550006428 ''Serrallés Family.''] Genealogy Incorporated. Retrieved 26 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; They had three sons and two daughters.  His eldest son, Juan Eugenio Serrallés, became the head of the Serrallés family business after Juan died in 1921. Juan's grandchildren — via Juan Eugenio's marriage to Rosa Maria Sanchez — were Rosa, Juan Eugenio, and Felix Juan.

Juan Eugenio built a huge castle in Ponce, called the [[Serralles Castle]], for his three children some ten years after his father's death, a testament to the prosperity of the plantation business that Juan Serrallés had started the previous century. Eventually one of these grandchildren, Felix Juan, became the next in line to run the sugar plantation and rum distillery businesses, which he did until his death in 1985.

==Currently==
The sugarcane business ceased to operate in 1994, with only the rum destillery that Juan had spearheaded decades before still operating.  Today, Juan Serrallés Colón's great-grandson, Felix Juan Serrallés, Jr., presides over [[Destileria Serralles]], Inc.

==Legacy==
The Government of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico has honored the memory of Juan Serrallés Colon by naming both a grade school and a high school&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.periodicolaperla.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=5831:ya-son-mas-de-400-crece-el-numero-de-heroes-en-ponce&amp;catid=81:locales&amp;Itemid=198 ''Crece el número de Héroes en Ponce.''] Reinaldo Millán.

{{Conflict of laws}}
The '''''lex loci arbitri''''' is the [[Latin]] term for "law of the place where [[arbitration]] is to take place" in the [[conflict of laws]]. Conflict is the branch of [[public law]] regulating all [[lawsuit]]s involving a "foreign" law element where a difference in result will occur depending on which laws are applied.

==Explanation==
When a case comes before a [[court]] and all the main features of the case are local, the court will apply the ''[[lex fori]]'', the prevailing municipal [[law]], to decide the case. But if there are "foreign" elements to the case, the forum court may be obliged under the conflict of laws system to consider:
*whether the forum court has [[jurisdiction]] to hear the case (see the problem of [[forum shopping]]);
*it must then [[characterisation (conflict)|characterise]] the issues, i.e. allocate the factual basis of the case to its relevant legal classes; and
*then apply the [[choice of law]] rules to decide which law is to be applied to each class.
The ''lex loci arbitri'' is an element in the choice of law rules applied to cases testing the validity of a [[contract (conflict)|contract]]. As an aspect of the [[public policy (law)|public policy]] of [[freedom of contract]], the [[party (law)|parties]] to an agreement are free to include a [[forum selection clause]] and/or a [[choice of law clause]] and, unless there is a lack of [[bona fides]], these clauses will be considered valid. If there is no express selection of a [[proper law]], the courts will usually take the nomination of a forum as a "connecting factor", i.e. a fact that links a case to a specific geographical location. For these purposes, one of the "forums" that may be selected is arbitration. Hence, the fact that the parties have chosen a [[Jurisdiction (area)|state]] as the place of arbitration is an indication that parties may have intended the local law to apply. This indication will be weighed alongside other connecting factors. The state that has the largest number of connecting factors will be the ''[[lex causae]]'' applied to resolve the dispute between the parties. If there is a tie, the connecting factors which relate to performance will be given a greater weighting.

{{Business administration}}
'''Marketing management''' is the process of developing strategies and planning for product or services, advertising, promotions, sales to reach desired customer segment.

== Structure ==
Marketing management employs tools from [[economics]] and [[competitive strategy]] to analyze the industry context in which the firm operates.  These include [[Porter 5 forces analysis|Porter's five forces]], analysis of [[strategic group]]s of competitors, [[value chain]] analysis and others.&lt;ref name="PorterCS"&gt;{{cite book
  | last = Porter
  | first = Michael
  | title = Competitive Strategy (revised ed.)
  | publisher = [[Free Press (publisher)|The Free Press]]
  | year = 1998
  | isbn = 0-684-84148-7
}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In competitor analysis, marketers build detailed profiles of each competitor in the market, focusing on their relative competitive strengths and weaknesses using [[SWOT analysis]].  Marketing managers will examine each competitor's cost structure, sources of profits, resources and competencies, competitive [[Positioning (marketing)|positioning]] and [[product differentiation]], degree of [[vertical integration]], historical responses to industry developments, and other factors.

Marketing management often conduct [[market research]] and [[marketing research]] to perform marketing analysis.  Marketers employ a variety of techniques to conduct market research, but some of the more common include:
* [[Qualitative marketing research]], such as [[focus groups]] and various types of interviews
* [[Quantitative marketing research]], such as [[statistical survey]]s
* [[Experimental techniques]] such as [[test market]]s
* [[Observational techniques]] such as [[ethnography|ethnographic]] (on-site) observation

Marketing managers may also design and oversee various [[environmental scanning]] and [[competitive intelligence]] processes to help identify trends and inform the company's marketing analysis.

===Brand audit===
A [[brand]] [[audit]] is a thorough examination of a brand's current position in an industry compared to its competitors and the examination of its effectiveness.  When it comes to brand auditing, six questions should be carefully examined and assessed:
#how well the business’ current brand strategy is working, 
#what the company's established resource strengths and weaknesses are,
#what its external opportunities and threats are,
#how competitive the business’ prices and costs are,
#how strong the business’ competitive position in comparison to its competitors is, and
#what strategic issues are facing the business.

When a business is conducting a brand audit, the goal is to uncover business’ resource strengths, deficiencies, best market opportunities, outside threats, future profitability, and its competitive standing in comparison to existing competitors.  A brand audit establishes the strategic elements needed to improve brand position and competitive capabilities within the industry.  Once a brand is audited, any business that ends up with a strong financial performance and market position is more likely than not to have a properly conceived and effectively executed brand strategy.

A brand audit examines whether a business’ share of the market is increasing, decreasing, or stable.  It determines if the company’s margin of profit is improving, decreasing, and how much it is in comparison to the [[profit margin]] of established competitors.  Additionally, a brand audit investigates trends in a business’ net profits, the return on existing investments, and its established economic value.  It determines whether or not the business’ entire financial strength and credit rating is improving or getting worse.  This kind of audit also assesses a business’ image and reputation with its customers.  Furthermore, a brand audit seeks to determine whether or not a business is [[perceived]] as an industry leader in technology, offering product or service innovations, along with exceptional customer service, among other relevant issues that customers use to decide on a brand of preference.

A brand audit usually focuses on a business’ strengths and resource capabilities because these are the elements that enhance its competitiveness.  A business’ competitive strengths can exist in several forms.  Some of these forms include skilled or pertinent expertise, valuable physical assets, valuable human assets, valuable organizational assets, valuable intangible assets, competitive capabilities, achievements and attributes that position the business into a competitive advantage, and alliances or cooperative ventures.

The basic concept of a brand audit is to determine whether a business’ resource strengths are competitive assets or competitive liabilities.  This type of  audit seeks to ensure that a business maintains a distinctive competence that allows it to build and reinforce its competitive advantage.  What’s more, a successful brand audit seeks to establish what a business capitalizes on best, its level of expertise, resource strengths, and strongest competitive capabilities, while aiming to identify a business’ position and future performance.

=== Marketing strategy ===
{{Main|Marketing strategy}}
Two customer segments are often selected as targets because they score highly on two dimensions:
# The segment is attractive to serve because it is large, growing, makes frequent purchases, is not price sensitive (i.e. is willing to pay high prices), or other factors; and
# The company has the resources and capabilities to compete for the segment's business, can meet their needs better than the competition, and can do so profitably.&lt;ref name="Clancy&amp;Krieg"/&gt;
A commonly cited definition of marketing is simply "meeting needs profitably".&lt;ref name="KotlerMM"&gt;{{cite book
  | last = Kotler
  | first = Philip.
  | authorlink = Philip Kotler
  |author2=[[Kevin Lane Keller]] 
  | title = Marketing Management, 12th ed.
  | publisher = [[Pearson Prentice Hall]]
  | year = 2006
  | isbn = 0-13-145757-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The implication of selecting target segments is that the business will subsequently allocate more resources to acquire and retain customers in the target segment(s) than it will for other, non-targeted customers.  In some cases, the firm may go so far as to turn away customers who are not in its target segment.The doorman at a swanky nightclub, for example, may deny entry to unfashionably dressed individuals because the business has made a strategic decision to target the "high fashion" segment of nightclub patrons.

In conjunction with targeting decisions, marketing managers will identify the desired [[Positioning (marketing)|positioning]] they want the company, product, or brand to occupy in the target customer's mind.  This positioning is often an encapsulation of a key benefit the company's product or service offers that is [[Product differentiation|differentiated]] and superior to the benefits offered by competitive products.&lt;ref name="Ries&amp;Trout"&gt;{{cite book
  | last = Ries
  | first = Al
  |author2=[[Jack Trout]] 
  | title = Positioning: The Battle for Your Mind (20th anniversary ed.)
  | publisher = [[McGraw-Hill]]
  | year = 2000
  | isbn = 0-07-135916-8
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, [[Volvo Cars|Volvo]] has traditionally positioned its products in the [[automobile]] market in North America in order to be perceived as the leader in "safety", whereas [[BMW]] has traditionally positioned its brand to be perceived as the leader in "performance".

Ideally, a firm's positioning can be maintained over a long period of time because the company possesses, or can develop, some form of [[sustainable competitive advantage]].&lt;ref name="PorterCA"&gt;{{cite book
  | last = Porter
  | first = Michael
  | title = Competitive Advantage (revised ed.)
  | publisher = [[Free Press (publisher)|The Free Press]]
  | year = 1998
  | isbn = 0-684-84146-0
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The positioning should also be sufficiently relevant to the target segment such that it will drive the purchasing behavior of target customers.&lt;ref name="Ries&amp;Trout"/&gt;
To sum up,the marketing branch of a company is to deal with the selling and popularity of its products among people and its customers,as the central and eventual goal of a company is customer satisfaction and the return of revenue.

=== Implementation planning ===
{{Main|Marketing plan}}
[[Image:Marketing Metrics Continuum.svg|thumb|300px|The Marketing Metrics Continuum provides a framework for how to categorize metrics from the tactical to strategic.]]
If the company has obtained an adequate understanding of the customer base and its own competitive position in the industry, marketing managers are able to make their own key strategic decisions and develop a [[marketing strategy]] designed to maximize the [[revenue]]s and [[Profit (accounting)|profits]] of the firm.  The selected strategy may aim for any of a variety of specific objectives, including optimizing short-term unit margins, revenue growth, [[market share]], long-term profitability, or other goals.

After the firm's strategic objectives have been identified, the target market selected, and the desired positioning for the company, product or brand has been determined, marketing managers focus on how to best implement the chosen strategy.  Traditionally, this has involved implementation planning across the "4 Ps" of : [[product management]], pricing (at what price slot does a producer position a product, e.g. low, medium or high price), place (the place or area where the products are going to be sold, which could be local, regional, countrywide or international) (i.e. sales and [[Distribution (business)|distribution]] channels), and Promotion.

Taken together, the company's implementation choices across the 4 Ps are often described as the [[marketing mix]], meaning the mix of elements the business will employ to "[[go to market]]" and execute the marketing strategy.  The overall goal for the marketing mix is to consistently deliver a compelling [[value proposition]] that reinforces the firm's chosen positioning, builds [[customer loyalty]] and [[brand equity]] among target customers, and achieves the firm's marketing and financial objectives.

In many cases, marketing management will develop a [[marketing plan]] to specify how the company will execute the chosen strategy and achieve the business' objectives.  The content of marketing plans varies from firm to firm, but commonly includes:
* An executive summary
* Situation analysis to summarize facts and insights gained from market research and marketing analysis
* The company's mission statement or long-term strategic vision
* A statement of the company's key objectives, often subdivided into marketing objectives and financial objectives
* The marketing strategy the business has chosen, specifying the target segments to be pursued and the competitive positioning to be achieved
* Implementation choices for each element of the marketing mix (the 4 Ps)

=== Project, process, and vendor management ===
More broadly, marketing managers work to design and improve the effectiveness of core marketing [[Business process|processes]], such as [[new product development]], [[brand management]], [[marketing communications]], and pricing.  Marketers may employ the tools of [[business process reengineering]] to ensure these processes are properly designed, and use a variety of [[process management]] techniques to keep them operating smoothly.

Effective execution may require management of both internal resources and a variety of external vendors and service providers, such as the firm's [[advertising agency]].  Marketers may therefore coordinate with the company's Purchasing department on the procurement of these services. Under the area of marketing agency management (i.e. working with external marketing agencies and suppliers) are techniques such as agency performance evaluation, scope of work, incentive compensation, [[RFx]]'s and storage of agency information in a supplier [[database]].

=== Reporting, measurement, feedback and control systems ===
Marketing management employs a variety of metrics to measure progress against objectives.  It is the responsibility of marketing managers to ensure that the execution of marketing programs achieves the desired objectives and does so in a [[cost-efficient]] manner.

Marketing management therefore often makes use of various organizational control systems, such as [[sales forecast]]s, and sales force and reseller [[incentive]] programs, [[sales force management system]]s, and [[customer relationship management]] tools (CRM). Some software vendors have begun using the term ''[[Marketing Operations Management|marketing operations management]]'' or ''[[Marketing Resource Management|marketing resource management]]'' to describe systems that facilitate an integrated approach for controlling marketing resources.  In some cases, these efforts may be linked to various [[supply chain management]] systems, such as [[enterprise resource planning]] (ERP), [[material requirements planning]] (MRP), [[Efficient Consumer Response|efficient consumer response]] (ECR), and [[inventory management]] systems.

=== International marketing management ===
[[Globalization]] has led some firms to market beyond the borders of their home countries, making [[international marketing]] a part of those firms' marketing strategy.&lt;ref&gt;Joshi, Rakesh Mohan, (2005) ''International Marketing'', [[Oxford University Press]], New Delhi and New York {{ISBN|0-19-567123-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marketing managers are often responsible for influencing the level, timing, and composition of customer demand. In part, this is because the role of a marketing manager (or sometimes called managing marketer in small- and medium-sized enterprises) can vary significantly based on a business's size, [[corporate culture]], and [[industry]] context.  
For example, in a small- and medium-sized enterprises, the managing marketer may contribute in both managerial and marketing operations roles for the company brands. In a large consumer products company, the marketing manager may act as the overall [[general manager]] of his or her assigned product.&lt;ref&gt;Kotler, P. and Keller, K.L. ''Marketing Management,'' 12th ed., Pearson, 2006, {{ISBN|0-13-145757-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
To create an effective, cost-efficient marketing management strategy, firms must possess a detailed, [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objective]] understanding of their own business and the [[Market (economics)|market]] in which they operate.&lt;ref name="Clancy&amp;Krieg"&gt;{{cite book

  | isbn = 0-684-85555-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In analyzing these issues, the discipline of marketing management often overlaps with the related discipline of [[strategic planning]].

The '''Morris A. Mechanic Theatre''' was a playhouse at 1 [[Maryland Route 139|North Charles Street]] that was part of the [[Charles Center]] of [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]].  The theatre was built by and named for owner Morris A. Mechanic who operated a number of theatres in the city such as the Stanton, Fords Grand Opera House, The Centre, The Century/Valencia Theatres, all of which he had demolished except for the Centre which has been restored and used as classroom space for Maryland Institute College Of Art and Johns Hopkins University Film Class. The theatre was demolished in 2014.

==History==
Mechanic planned the theatre to replace the aging [[Ford's Grand Opera House]] which he had purchased in 1929 and had demolished in February 1964, replaced by a parking garage for Stewart's Department Store. A year later he also had the Stanton Theatre (located at 516 North Howard Street) demolished in July 1965 (also replaced by a parking lot) to avoid any competition with his new theatre which bore his name. Mechanic bought the theatre from The Stanley-Warner Co in February 1958 and changed the name to The Stanton in the fall of 1959, using it primarily for legitimate shows, closed circuit TV shows, variety shows, and movies and also including live performance shows which he leased to JF Theatres. He engaged architect [[John M. Johansen]] who designed the building in a style he termed “functional expressionism”, also known as [[Brutalist architecture|brutalism]].&lt;ref name=obit&gt;{{cite news| title=In Memory of John Johansen, architect of the Mechanic| url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/opinion/readersrespond/bs-ed-johanson-letter-20121118,0,5408507.story| work=The Baltimore Sun| date=November 18, 2012| accessdate=February 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mechanic chose the site formerly occupied by offices of ''[[The Baltimore Sun]]''.

Mechanic died in 1966 from a heart attack while the building was under construction and his widow, Clarisse, Mayor [[Theodore McKeldin]] and Eugene M. Feinblatt, chairman of the Baltimore Urban Renewal and Housing Agency, presided over the opening gala January 16, 1967.  For many years, the theater was Baltimore’s primary venue to host touring Broadway plays and helped the city shed its reputation as a “lousy theatre town.”&lt;ref name="mdoe"&gt;{{cite web| title=Morris A. Mechanic Theatre| first=Elizabeth| last=Schaaf| publisher=mdoe.org| work=Maryland Online Encyclopedia| url=http://www.mdoe.org/theatmechanic.html| year=2005| accessdate=January 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several Broadway-bound productions had their tryouts at the Mechanic. They include [[I'm Solomon]], [[Jimmy Shine]], [[Applause]], [[The Wiz]], [[Smile]], [[Lend Me a Tenor]] and [[Busker Alley]].{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}

However, in the 1980s and 1990s, producers felt that the theatre was too small and outdated to accommodate the larger shows of the era.&lt;ref name="sun"&gt;{{cite news| title=Hippo's opening another night to remember| work=The Baltimore Sun| date=February 4, 2004| url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2004-02-14/features/0402140194_1_mechanic-theatre-hippodrome-baltimore-street| last=Kelly| first=Jacques| accessdate=February 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jujamcyn Theaters]] began managing the Mechanic in 1998.&lt;ref name=rousuck&gt;{{cite news| title=Jujamcyn to book Mechanic Growth: Brought in as a consultant, the company will now manage the theater| url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1998-05-04/features/1998124006_1_jujamcyn-theaters-mechanic-show-boat| last=Rousuck| first=J.

Clear Channel Entertainment operated the Hippodrome and chose not to renew its lease on the Mechanic.&lt;ref name=gunts&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2004-08-02/features/0408020112_1_mechanic-hippodrome-clear-channel| title=Mechanic Theatre loses operating company| date=August 2, 2004| last=Gunts| first=Edward| newspaper=The Baltimore Sun| accessdate=February 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Renovation plans and demolition==
In 2005, Melvin and Benjamin Greenwald purchased the shuttered building for $6 million with plans to renovate it into retail space and add a 10-story residential building on the east side.  Preservationists disagreed with the Greenwalds’ assessment that there was “no historic integrity to the building” and urged that it be carefully adapted for reuse.  After hearings in August 2007,&lt;ref name="record"&gt;{{cite web| title=Brutal Overhaul for Baltimore’s Mechanic Theater?| work=[[Architectural Record]]| date=August 10, 2007| accessdate=January 20, 2011| url=http://archrecord.construction.com/news/daily/archives/070810mechanic.asp| first=David| last=Sadighan}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Baltimore Commission for Historical and Architecture Preservation declined to grant the building landmark status.&lt;ref name=kilar&gt;{{cite news |title=Plans for Mechanic Theater site stir controversy |url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/breaking/bs-bz-udarp-mechanic-20120802,0,499090.story |first=Steve |last=Kilar |work=The Baltimore Sun |date=August 2, 2012 |accessdate=February 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 25, 2009, David S. Brown Enterprises unveiled a plan to add a 30-story tower that would house a 161-room hotel and 250 rental units.  The former theater space would be converted to retail and a skylight installed to make it more welcoming to shoppers.  Architect Dan Stuver said the design aimed to retain the building’s defining characteristics while adapting it to a new use.  The plan did not contain cost estimates or details.&lt;ref name="biz"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.bizjournals.com/baltimore/stories/2009/02/23/daily37.html| title=David S.

In 2012, the developer abandoned the 2009 plan and filed an application for demolition. While initially delayed due to historical preservation concerns, officials granted his request in March 2014.&lt;ref name=litten&gt;{{cite news| title=Baltimore issues demolition permit for the Mechanic Theatre| url=http://www.bizjournals.com/baltimore/blog/real-estate/2014/04/baltimore-issues-demolition-permit-for-the.html| last=Litten| first=Kevin| date=April 30, 2014| work=Baltimore Business Journal| accessdate=September 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The underground parking garage was still in use until September 2014 although the theater closed ten years earlier. In September 2014, the parking garage closed and crews erected fences to begin demolition work, followed by construction of new high rise residential and commercial space.&lt;ref name="sun-9-4-2014"&gt;{{cite news| work=The Baltimore Sun| date=September 4, 2014| first=Natalie| last=Sherman| title=Demolition to Start on Mechanic Theater| url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/business/real-estate/wonk/bal-demolition-to-start-on-mechanic-theatre-20140904,0,7902776.story}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Scharmen&gt;{{cite  news| url=http://www.citypaper.com/news/mobtownbeat/bcp-brutal-reckoning-20141014,0,2894060.story| title=Brutal Reckoning| first=Fred| last=Scharmen| date=October 14, 2014| work=[[Baltimore City Paper]]| accessdate=February 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WJZ&gt;{{cite news| url=http://baltimore.cbslocal.com/2013/03/26/morris-mechanic-theatre-demolition-will-make-way-for-apartment-complex/| title=Morris Mechanic Theatre Demolition Will Make Way For Apartment Complex| work=[[WJZ-TV]] News| date=March 26, 2013| accessdate=February 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.bizjournals.com/baltimore/blog/real-estate/2014/09/mechanic-theatre-demolition-finally-underway.html?page=all| title=Mechanic Theatre demolition finally underway| date=September 4, 2014| work=Baltimore Business Journal| accessdate=February 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=8photos&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.bizjournals.com/baltimore/slideshow/2014/09/30/8-photos-of-the-mechanic-theatre-as-its-being.html| title=8 photos of the Mechanic Theatre as it's being demolished| date=September 30, 2014| work=Baltimore Business Journal| accessdate=February 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architecture==
The Mechanic Theater consisted of a square podium that housed retail space and an underground parking garage as part of the Charles Center.  The fan-shaped auditorium that seated 1,614 sat atop the podium and had a street-level entrance on Hopkins Plaza as well as a pedestrian bridge that connected to an elevated walkway leading to other buildings in Charles Center.  Balconies were behind the orchestra seats and protruded beyond the exterior walls to give the building the appearance of a [[Ratchet (device)|ratchet]] gear when viewed from above.

The exterior of the building was rough concrete that bore the markings from the wooden forms used to create the walls.  The street entrance on Hopkins Plaza led to a stairway that took patrons to the lobby on the second floor.  The exterior lobby wall was glass while interior walls had a faux wood finish or were covered with burnt-orange vinyl.  The plaza-level entrance was framed by towers holding stairs and elevators to access the balcony.  The stage house was clearly defined as a separate element attached to the auditorium.

In November 2009, the British newspaper ''[[Daily Mail]]'' reported that Virtual Tourist.com named the Mechanic Theatre as number one in its list of the Top Ten ugliest buildings.&lt;ref name="mail"&gt;{{cite news| work=Daily Mail| publisher=dailymail.co.uk| date=November 20, 2009| author=Sarah Gordon| title=Top ten ugliest buildings in the world unveiled-and many are in our most beautiful cities| url= http://www.dailymail.co.uk/travel/article-1229540/Top-ugliest-buildings-world-unveiled--beautiful-cities.html| accessdate=January 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1618">[[Image:Logo NEWS.png|right]]The '''Network of European Worldshops''' (NEWS!) was established in 1994 and coordinates the cooperation between [[Worldshops]] in [[Europe]]. It is a network of national associations of [[Worldshops]] representing 2,500 shops in 13 member countries: [[Austria]], [[Belgium]], [[Denmark]], [[Finland]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Ireland]], [[Italy]], [[Netherlands]], [[Spain]], [[Sweden]], [[Switzerland]], and the [[United Kingdom]]. 

NEWS! initiates and coordinates joint campaigns and awareness raising activities of the European [[Worldshops]] (such as the annual European Worldshops Day in May) and supports the professionalisation of national associations of Worldshops. The aim of NEWS! is the promotion of [[fair trade]] in general and the development of the Worldshops movement in particular.

Worldshops sell fair trade products and organize various educational exhibits, programmes and campaigns to promote fairer trade practices. Worldshops cooperate on local, regional, national, and international levels, supported by their National Associations.

NEWS! ceased to exist in its original form in October 2008. It is currently part of the European chapter of the [[World Fair Trade Organization]]: WFTO-Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wfto.com/index.php?option=com_docman&amp;task=doc_download&amp;gid=1445&amp;&amp;Itemid=1|page=10|title=Annual Report 2009|publisher=World Fair Trade Organization|accessdate=23 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Olav Fjell''' (born 28 June 1951) is a Norwegian businessperson. He was the [[chief executive officer]] (CEO) of [[Statoil]] from 1999 to 2003, and of [[Hurtigruten Group|Hurtigruten]] from 2007 to 2012.

==Career==
Fjell has a [[siviløkonom|siv.øk.]] degree from the [[Norwegian School of Economics]] in 1975 as well as education from the [[Norwegian Army|Royal Norwegian Army]]. His career started as an accountant at [[Kongsberg Gruppen|Kongsberg Vaabenfabrik]] in 1975 where he stayed until 1987, by which time he had become vice president. He had a continual employment in [[Bergen Bank]], [[Den norske Bank]] and finally as CEO of [[Postbanken]] until he was hired as CEO of Statoil in 1999. After quitting in Statoil in 2004 he worked as a strategic and financial adviser for [[First Securities]]. He was later chief executive of [[Lindorff]] from 2006 to 2007 and [[Hurtigruten Group|Hurtigruten]] from 2007 to 2012.

He has also had a number of [[board of directors|board positions]], including chairman of the [[Norwegian State Railways]] from 2000 to 2003,&lt;ref name=snl&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|year=|title=Olav Fjell|encyclopedia=[[Store norske leksikon]]|editor=|publisher=|location=|url=http://www.snl.no/Olav_Fjell|language=Norwegian|accessdate=17 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Eastern Drilling]] and [[Lindorff]]. He currently chairs of the boards of [[Statkraft]] and [[Deep Sea Supply]].

He is a fellow of the [[Norwegian Academy of Technological Sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ntva.no/index.php?option=com_club&amp;view=member&amp;id=128%3Afjell-olav&amp;Itemid=60|title=Medlemmer: FJELL, Olav|publisher=[[Norwegian Academy of Technological Sciences]]|language=Norwegian|accessdate=11 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
As a controversial businessperson, Fjell has had a strained relationship with the [[mass media|press]]. In his last period as [[Chief financial officer|CFO]] in Kongsberg, he had massive problems internally because of the company's economic fall and felt that the press was excessive and critical. As in 2003 with the [[Statoil corruption case]] in Iran it was [[Dagens Næringsliv]] that led the critical journalism. It ended with him being decommissioned from his position with Kongsberg.

Fjell was central in the corruption scandal that Statoil experienced in 2003. After pressure both internally and from the media the board had to remove Fjell on the evening of 22 September 2003. Statoil was fined {{NOK|20 million}} for corruption from the [[Norwegian National Authority for the Investigation and Prosecution of Economic and Environmental Crime]]. Despite the seriousness of the case and the weakening of the name of Statoil, Fjell was according to the media given a compensation between NOK 7.5 and 10 million. In addition he sued Statoil with demands for early pension from 60 years equal to 66% of his wage. Statoil denied this agreement, though it was mentioned in the press release at the time of Fjells departure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statoil.com/STATOILCOM/SVG00990.NSF/UNID/41256A3A0055DD31C1256DA900816B92?opendocument|title=Olav Fjell fratrer som konsernsjef i Statoil ASA|publisher=[[Statoil]]|language=Norwegian|date=23 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2005 Fjell won the court case, and he can expect{{Update after|2010|11|16}} payments from Statoil up to about NOK 40 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://web3.aftenbladet.no/innenriks/okonomi/article242673.ece|title=Fjell fikk medhold i voldgiftsretten|date=15 December 2005|first=Odd|last=Steinsholt|language=Norwegian|work=[[Stavanger Aftenblad]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Old Saint Paul's Cemetery''' is a [[cemetery]] located in downtown [[Baltimore, Maryland]], United States. It is noted for the several important historical figures that are interred in its grounds.&lt;ref name="mht_ihp"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mht.maryland.gov/secure/medusa/PDF/NR_PDFs/NR-1012.pdf |title=National Register of Historic Places Registration: Old Saint Paul's Cemetery|date=October 1986|accessdate=2016-04-01 |author=Mrs. Washington Bowie and R. Kent Lancaster|publisher=Maryland Historical Trust}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1988.&lt;ref name="nris"/&gt;

==History==
The first cemetery of [[St. Paul's Episcopal Church (Baltimore, Maryland)|Saint Paul's Church (Protestant Episcopal)]] in [[Baltimore]] was located at the future intersection of  Sollers Road and [[North Point Road]] in what is now the area of [[Dundalk, Maryland|Dundalk]] in southeastern [[Baltimore County]]. The original small church of St. Paul's Parish of the established [[Church of England]] was one of the "Original Thirty" parishes designated for the colonial [[Province of Maryland]] and was founded in 1692 and considered to be the first and oldest church in Baltimore County and City and one of the oldest in the State. In 1730, the Parish Church of St. Paul's was moved from near Colgate Creek on the "Patapsco Neck" peninsula to the new burgeoning town of Baltimore overlooking "The Basin" at the head of the [[Patapsco River]] on its Northwest Branch, and Lot #19 was purchased in the "Original Survey" of that year by county surveyor Phillip Jones from [[Charles Carroll of Annapolis]].

As the designated parish for the new [[Baltimore County]], which then included most of northeastern Maryland when it was "erected" (established) in 1659, the first St. Paul's was located around the vicinity of the lower Colgate Creek which flowed into the [[Patapsco River]] and is assumed that the cemetery would be located somewhere nearby. The small earlier "county seat" for the new County was "old Joppa", located in the middle portion then of what was the "Old County" (including modern Baltimore City and County, Harford, Cecil, Carroll, and portions of Anne Arundel, Howard and Kent Counties), now in the vicinity of the post-Second World War suburban development of "Joppatowne" and an earlier "Baltimore" located on the Bush River, until the county seat was moved in 1767-68to the new burgeoning "Baltimore Town", with a flourishing port established in 1706, and a small town laid out in 1729–30.

The church site was probably in the area of the future aviation sites of  "[[Logan Field, Maryland|Logan Field]]", "[[Baltimore Municipal Airport]]" (later known as "Harbor Field" after World War II), and now the grounds of the "Dundalk Marine Terminal" and "Sea Girt Marine Terminal" of the facilities for the [[Helen Delich Bentley Port of Baltimore|Port of Baltimore]] Laid out in 1692, along with the Parish, this churchyard is the oldest cemetery that is known to have existed in the Baltimore metropolitan area.

About 1760, those remains were exhumed and moved to the new Saint Paul's Burial Ground which surrounded the original church, which was the first building in the new town to be built of brick and completed after 9 years of work in 1739 at [[Maryland Route 139|Forest Street (now North Charles Street)]] and the intersecting east-west lane which later became East Saratoga Street after the [[American Revolution]] to commemorate the famous "turning point" [[Battle of Saratoga|battle]] in 1777 along the [[Hudson River]] in [[New York (state)|New York State]]. To the east lay the [[Jones Falls]] Bluffs which stood from 1739 to 1817, over the southwestward "loop" of the stream before its course was further north. Below the cliffs was another lane which was named for the church as "Saint Paul's Lane" (to become St. Paul Street and in the southern portion after construction of the terraced "Preston Gardens" in the 1920s, became known as Saint Paul Place. To the south at the then limit of the lot was laid out New Church Street which later became East and West Lexington Streets (also after the Revolution), one block south of the later church buildings. That building was replaced by another in (1812, 1813–17?) of Greek Revival design by famous local architect [[Robert Cary Long, Jr.]] which burned in 1854 and was later replaced by the present building in 1856 which fills that entire property, at the current intersection of North Charles and East Saratoga Streets.

In the late 18th century, the [[Vestry]] of Old St. Paul's Church was faced with the need for a third cemetery. Cemeteries had never been viewed as good neighbors, aside from the fact that they contained the bodies and souls of the departed (who, it was believed, had the ability to wander the land), they could become unsightly and even unhealthy.

Therefore, a new cemetery site was purchased in 1800 on the western edge of town. This site is bordered on the west by Martin Luther King Boulevard (Cove Street at the time of purchase, later Fremont Avenue), Lombard Street on the south, and Redwood Street (formerly German Street) on the north. Several members of the Vestry owned a great deal of undeveloped property in this area.

Church member Samuel Smythe purchased 2.8 acres (11,000 m²) of land from the heirs of Alexander Robinson, whose house is found on the 1802 "Hanna and Warner" map of Baltimore, directly across German Street from the Smythe purchase. The land was subsequently bought by the Church. Many of the parishioners immediately bought grave lots and began construction of vaults and plots.

When [[Martin Luther King Jr]] Boulevard was constructed, during the mid-1980s, one end of this cemetery was lost on the west side  and the remains and markers were moved within the remaining walled cemetery that now sits surrounded by the [[University of Maryland, Baltimore]] campus.

A '''Purchasing Manager''' is an employee within a [[company]], [[business]] or other [[organization]] who is responsible at some level for buying or approving the acquisition of goods and services needed by the company. Responsible for buying the best quality products, goods and services for their company at the most competitive prices, purchasing managers work in a wide range of sectors for many different organizations. The position responsibilities may be the same as that of a [[buyer]] or purchasing agent, or may include wider supervisory or managerial responsibilities. A Purchasing Manager may oversee the acquisition of materials needed for [[Manufacturing|production]], general supplies for offices and facilities, equipment, or construction contracts. A Purchasing Manager often supervises purchasing agents and buyers, but in small companies the Purchasing Manager may also be the purchasing agent or buyer. The '''Purchasing Manager''' position may also carry the title "'''Procurement Manager'''" or in the public sector, "'''Procurement Officer'''". He or she can come from both an Engineering or Economics background.

A Purchasing Manager's responsibilities may include:
* seeking reliable [[vendor (supply chain)|vendors]] or suppliers to provide quality goods at reasonable prices
* negotiating prices and contracts
* reviewing technical specifications for [[raw materials]], components, equipment or buildings
* determining quantity and timing of deliveries (more commonly in small companies)
* forecasting upcoming demand.

'''Ray Evans''' (10 September 1939 – 17 June 2014) was an Australian business leader, a conservative, and campaigner against [[climate change mitigation]] efforts.

==Biography==

===Early years===
Ray Evans was educated at [[Melbourne High School]]. He attended the [[University of Melbourne]], from which he graduated in Electrical and Mechanical Engineering. During his years at university, he served as President of the Melbourne University ALP Club and as a delegate from the Federated Fodder and Fuel Trades Union to Victorian [[Australian Labor Party|ALP]] State Conferences.

He resigned from the ALP to act as campaign manager for [[Sam Benson]] in the latter's successful campaign to retain the federal seat of [[Division of Batman|Batman]] as an independent in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=In Search of the Magic Pudding: Contributors |url=http://www.hrnicholls.com.au/nicholls/nichvol5/vol5prof.htm |publisher=H.R. Nicholls Society |accessdate=28 April 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080202080718/http://www.hrnicholls.com.au/nicholls/nichvol5/vol5prof.htm |archivedate=2 February 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1960s Evans worked as a young engineer in the [[Production Planning]] Section of the [[State Electricity Commission of Victoria]].

===Career===
He taught electrical engineering at [[Deakin University]], Victoria. From 1982 until 2001, he was Executive Officer at the major Australian mining company, [[Western Mining Corporation]], (WMC Ltd), under [[Hugh Morgan (Australian businessman)|Hugh Morgan]]. From July 2001 to June 2014, he was the [[Board of directors|Director]] of Ray Evans &amp; Associates, a consultancy specialising in political and economic advice.&lt;ref name=olo&gt;{{cite web

===Political advocacy===
In January 1986, Evans, along with former [[Treasurer of Australia|federal Treasurer]] [[Peter Costello]] and two others, founded the [[H R Nicholls Society]], a [[think tank]] of the [[New Right]], of which he became president. The Society has had considerable influence over [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal Party]] policies. The initial motivation for founding the Society was [[industrial relations]] – a commitment to "freedom in the labour market", and opposition to the Australian industrial relations mechanism, represented by the establishment of the [[minimum wage]] by Justice [[H. B. Higgins|Henry Bourne Higgins]] in the 1905 [[Ex parte H.V. McKay|"Harvester Judgement"]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last=Bachelard | first=Michael | title=Right-wing warriors who changed the workplace | newspaper=The Age (Melbourne) | date=15 December 2007 | postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Global warming skepticism====
He was also a founder of the [[Lavoisier Group]], which opposed the ratification of the Kyoto treaty, believing that the science associated with global warming is uncertain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|title= About Lavoisier 
|publisher=The Lavoisier Group 
|url=http://www.lavoisier.com.au
|accessdate=4 February 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, he was instrumental in establishing a number of other right-wing organisations, such as the [[Bennelong Society]], and the [[Samuel Griffith Society]], for all of which he was either president or treasurer.&lt;ref name="hamil"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/rn/saturdayextra/stories/2007/1901158.htm |title=Clive Hamilton – Saturday Breakfast RN – 21 April 2007 |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |accessdate=2 November 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to author [[Clive Hamilton]], many of these groups "shared the same post office box".&lt;ref name="hamil"/&gt;

A supporter of the "[[Greenhouse Mafia]]", he remained a committed campaigner against [[climate change]] initiatives, dubbing [[global warming]] "the mother of environmental scares".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Evans | first=Ray | title = The politics behind Kyoto | journal = Australia &amp; World Affairs | date = Winter 1998 | issue = 37}}&lt;/ref&gt; In collaboration with [[Hugh Morgan (Australian businessman)|Hugh Morgan]], Evans worked against the [[Kyoto Protocol]], and was central to the campaign to prevent the former Federal [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal]] Government from taking actions to cut emissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Hamilton | first = Clive | title = Scorcher: the dirty politics of climate change | year = 2007 | publisher = Black Inc. Agenda | isbn = 978-0-9775949-0-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He appeared on the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]]'s discussion panel discussing ''[[The Great Global Warming Swindle]]'', a documentary which questioned the science behind global warming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|title=Ray Evans
|publisher=On Line Opinion
|url=http://www.onlineopinion.com.au/author.asp?id=528
|accessdate=4 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has stated that environmentalism is a "religious belief," and published a book ''Nine Facts About Climate Change'' in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last=Murphy | first = Katherine | title=Greenhouse sceptics to congregate | newspaper=The Age (Melbourne) | page=6 | date=28 February 2007 | postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was quoted in ''[[The Age]]'' as saying that [[Al Gore]]'s film ''[[An Inconvenient Truth]]'' is "bullshit from beginning to end", and that "the carbon-dioxide link [to global warming] is increasingly recognised as irrelevant".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/greenhouse-sceptics-to-congregate/2007/02/27/1172338625822.html |title=Greenhouse sceptics to congregate – National |work=The Age |accessdate=3 November 2009 | location=Melbourne | date=28 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death===
He died on 17 June 2014 in [[Melbourne]], aged 74 (though some reports incorrectly stated he was 79).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/policy/hr-nicholls-society-cofounder-ray-evans-dead-at-79/story-fn59noo3-1226958942946 HR Nicholls Society co-founder Ray Evans dead at 79], ''[[The Australian]]'', 18 June 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theage.com.au/opinion/how-ray-evans-warrior-of-the-new-right-changed-australia-20140620-zsgf9.html 'How Ray Evans, warrior of the new right, changed Australia', ''[[The Age]]'', 20 June 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bracing for a short, sharp jab.jpg|thumb|Services include a wide range of commercial and not-for-profit transactions including personal services, professional services, entertainment and leisure services.]]
'''Services marketing''' is a specialised branch of [[marketing]]. [[Service (economics)|Services]] marketing emerged as a separate field of study in the early 1980s, following the recognition that the unique characteristics of services required different strategies compared with the marketing of physical goods.

Services marketing typically refers to both [[business to consumer]] (B2C) and [[business-to-business]] (B2B) services, and includes marketing of services such as [[telecommunications service]]s, [[financial service]]s, all types of hospitality, [[tourism]] leisure and entertainment services, [[car rental]] services, [[health care]] services and [[professional services]] and trade services. Service marketers often use an expanded [[marketing mix]] which consists of the [[seven Ps]]: product, price, place, promotion, people, physical evidence and process. A contemporary approach, known as ''service-dominant logic'', argues that the demarcation between products and services that persisted throughout the 20th century was artificial and has obscured that everyone sells service. The S-D logic approach is changing the way that marketers understand ''[[value proposition|value-creation]]'' and is changing concepts of the [[consumer]]'s role in service delivery processes.

==Services: definitions==

The [[American Marketing Association]] defines services marketing as an organisational function and a set of processes for identifying or creating, communicating, and delivering value to customers and for managing [[customer relationship]] in a way that benefit the organisation and stake-holders. Services are (usually) intangible economic activities offered by one party to another. Often time-based, services performed bring about desired results to recipients, objects, or other assets for which purchasers have responsibility. In exchange for money, time, and effort, service customers expect value from access to goods, labor, professional skills, facilities , networks, and systems; but they do not normally take ownership of any of the physical elements involved.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Lovelock and Jochen Wirtz (2011), ''Services Marketing: People, Technology, Strategy,'' 7th ed., Upper Saddle River, New Jersey, Prentice Hall&lt;/ref&gt;

: '''A service encounter''' can be defined as the duration in which a customer interacts with a service. The customer's interactions with a service provider typically involve face-to-face contact with service personnel, in addition to interactions with the physical elements of the service environment including the facilities and equipment. &lt;ref&gt;Furnham, A.and Milner, R., "The Impact of Mood on Customer Behavior: Staff Mood and Environmental Factors,"  ''Journal of Retail and Consumer Services,'' Vo. 20, 2013, p. 634&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concepts of service==

[[File:Advokat, Engelsk advokatdräkt, Nordisk familjebok.png|thumb|Classical economists believed that service work, no matter how honourable, was 'unproductive'.]]

Scholars have long debated the nature of services. Some of the earliest attempts to define services focused on what makes them different from goods. Late-eighteenth and early-nineteenth century definitions highlighted the nature of ownership and wealth creation. Classical economists contended that goods were objects of value over which ownership rights could be established and exchanged. Ownership implied possession of a tangible object that had been acquired through purchase, barter or gift from the producer or previous owner and was legally identifiable as the property of the current owner. In contrast, when services were purchased, no title to goods changed hands.

===Historical perspectives===

[[Adam Smith]]'s seminal work, ''The Wealth of Nations'' (1776), distinguished between the outputs of what he termed "productive" and "unproductive" labor. The former, he stated, produced goods that could be stored after production and subsequently exchanged for money or other items of value. But unproductive labor, however "honourable, ...useful, or... necessary" created services that perished at the time of production and therefore didn't contribute to wealth.

French economist [[Jean-Baptiste Say]] argued that production and consumption were inseparable in services, coining the term "immaterial products" to describe them.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, A., ''The Wealth of Nations,''1776&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1920s, [[Alfred Marshall]] was still using the idea that services "are immaterial products."&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, A., ''Principles of Economics'', 8th edition (1920), Macmillan, London&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid nineteenth century [[John Stuart Mill]] wrote that services are "utilities not fixed or embodied in any object, but consisting of a mere service rendered ...without leaving a permanent acquisition."&lt;ref&gt;Mill, J.S., ''Principles of a Political Economy'', 1852 vol. 1, J.W. Parker, London, 1852&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contemporary perspectives===

When services marketing emerged as a separate sub-branch within the marketing discipline in the early 1980s, it was largely a protest against the dominance of prevailing product-centric view.&lt;ref&gt;Gummesson, E.,  "Implementing the Marketing Concept: From Service and Values to Lean Consumption," ''Marketing Theory,'' [Invited Commentary], vol. 6, no. 3, 2006, pp 291–293&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schembri, S., "Rationalizing Service Logic, or Understanding Services as Experience?" ''Marketing Theory,'' vol 6, no. 3, 2006, pp 381–392.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1960, the US economy changed forever. In that year, for the first time in a major trading nation, more people were employed in the service sector than in manufacturing industries.&lt;ref&gt;Bell, D., ''The Coming of a Post-Industrial Economy,'' (1973), Basic Books, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; Other developed nations soon followed by shifting to a service based economy.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, B., ''Sleepers Wake! Technology and the Future of Work,'' Oxford University Press, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars soon began to recognise that services were important in their own right, rather than as some residual category left over after goods were taken into account. This recognition triggered a change in the way services were defined. By the mid twentieth century, scholars began defining services in terms of their own unique characteristics, rather than by comparison with products.&lt;ref&gt;Berry, L.L. and Parasuraman, A., 
"Building a New Academic Field: The Case of Services Marketing," ''Journal of Retailing,'' Vol. 69, no. 1, 993, pp 13-60&lt;/ref&gt; The following set of definitions shows how scholars were grappling with the distinctive aspects of service products and developing new definitions of service.&lt;ref&gt;Furrer, O. and Sollberger,  P., "The Dynamics and Evolution of the Service Marketing Literature: 1993–2003," ''Service Business,'' vol. 1, no. 2, 2006, pp 93-117&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fisk., R. and Grove,  S.J., [http://www.ifm.eng.cam.ac.uk/ssme/papers/Fisk_ssme_cambridge_07.pdf "The Evolution of Services: Building a Multi-disciplinary Field"],  [unpublished manuscript], 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

* "The term 'service'... is synonymous with value. A supplier has a value proposition, but value actualization takes place during the customer's usage and consumption process."

===Alternative view===
A recently proposed alternative view is that services involve a form of rental through which customers can obtain benefits.&lt;ref name="Lovelock 2004 20-41"&gt;Lovelock, C. and Gummesson, E., "Whither Services Marketing?: In Search of a New Paradigm and Fresh Perspectives", ''Journal of Service Research,'' vol 7, no. 1, 2004, pp 20-41&lt;/ref&gt; Customers are willing to pay for aspirational experiences and solutions that add value to their lifestyle. The term, rent, can be used as a general term to describe payment made for use of something or access to skills and expertise, facilities or networks (usually for a defined period of time), instead of buying it outright (which is not even possible in many instances).&lt;ref name="Lovelock 2004 20-41"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lovelock, C. and Wirtz, J., ''Services Marketing: People, Technology, Strategy,'' p. 14, 7th ed., Upper Saddle River, New Jersey, Prentice Hall. 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

There are five broad categories within the non-ownership framework
# Rented goods services: These services enable customers to obtain the temporary right to use a physical good that they prefer not to own (e.g. boats, costumes)
# Defined space and place rentals: These services obtain use of a defined portion of a larger space in a building, vehicle or other area which can be an end in its own right (e.g. storage container in a warehouse) or simply a means to an end (e.g. table in a restaurant, seat in an aircraft)
# Labor and expertise rental: People are hired to perform work that customers either choose not to do for themselves (e.g. cleaning the house) or are unable to do due to the lack of expertise, tools and skills (e.g. car repairs, surgery)
# Access to shared physical environments: These environments can be indoors or outdoors where customers rent the right to share the use of the environment (e.g. museums, theme parks, gyms, golf courses).
# Access to and usage of systems and networks: Customers rent the right to participate in a specified network such as telecommunications, utilities, banking or insurance, with different fees for varying levels of access

==Services: Unique characteristics==

[[File:Cosmetologist applying skincare treatment.jpg|thumb|A distinctive feature of services is that production and consumption cannot be separated.]]
Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, the so-called unique characteristics of services dominated much of the literature.

The four most commonly cited characteristics of services are:&lt;ref&gt;Zeithaml, V.A, Parasuraman, A. and Berry, L.L., "Problems and Strategies in Services Marketing," ''Journal of Marketing,'' 
Vol. 49, No. 2, 1985, pp. 33-46&lt;/ref&gt;
:''Intangibility'' – services lack physical form; they do not interact with any our senses in a conventional way, they cannot be touched or held. 
: Implications of intangibility: Ownership cannot be transferred, value derives from consumption or experience, quality is difficult to evaluate prior to consumption or purchase.
 
:''Inseparability'' – production and consumption cannot be separated (compared with goods where production and consumption are entirely discrete processes)
: Implications of inseparability: Services are typically high contact systems and are labour-intensive; fewer opportunities to transact business at arm's length, fewer opportunities to substitute capital for labour; subject to human error.

:''Perishability'' – service performances are ephemeral; unlike physical goods, services cannot be stored or inventoried.
: Implications of perishability: Demand is subject to wide fluctuations, no inventory to serve as a buffer between supply and demand; unused capacity cannot be reserved; high opportunity cost of idle capacity.

:''Variability'' (also known as heterogeneity) – services involve processes delivered by service personnel and subject to human variation, customers often seek highly customised solutions, services are inherently variable in quality and substance.
: Implications of variability: Service quality is difficult to manage; fewer opportunities to standardise service delivery.

The unique characteristics of services give rise to problems and challenges that are rarely paralleled in product marketing.Services are complex, multi-dimensional and multi-layered. Not only are there multiple benefits, but there are also a multiplicity of interactions between customers and organisations as well as between customers and other customers.

===Classification of goods and services===

{{See also|Search good|Experience good|Credence good}}

There are many ways to classify services. One classification considers who or what is being processed and identifies three classes of services: people processing (e.g. beauty services, child care, medical services); mental stimulus processing (e.g. education services, counselling services, life-coaching), possession processing (e.g. pet care, appliance repair, piano tuning) and information processing (e.g. financial services, data warehousing services).&lt;ref&gt;Lovelock, C. and Wirtz, j., ''Services Marketing: People, Technology, Strategy,'' 7th ed., 2010, Chapter 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lovelock, C., "Classifying Services to Gain Strategic Insight," ''Journal of Marketing,'' vol. 47, Summer, 1983, pp 9-20&lt;/ref&gt; Another method used to classify services uses the degree of customer interaction in the service process and classifies services as ''high contact'' (e.g. hospitality, dental care, hairdressing) or ''low contact''  (e.g. telecommunications, utility services).&lt;ref&gt;Grove, S.J., Fisk, R.P. and  John, J., "Services as Theater: Guidelines and Implications,"  in ''Handbook of Services Marketing and Management,'' Swartz, R., and Iacobucci, D (eds), Thousand Oaks, CA, Sage, 2000, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;

Both economists and marketers make extensive use of the Search → Experience → Credence (SEC) classification of goods and services. The classification scheme is based on the ease or difficulty of consumer evaluation activities and identifies three broad classes of goods.&lt;ref&gt;Ford, G.T., Smith, D.B.  and Swasy, J.L. [http://acrwebsite.org/volumes/6817/volumes/v15/NA-15 "An Empirical Test of the Search, Experience and Credence Attributes Framework"], in ''Advances in Consumer Research,'' Vol. 15, Micheal J. Houston (ed.), Provo, UT : Association for Consumer Research, pp 239-244&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, V-W. and Greatorex, M. "Risk Perception and Reduction in the Purchase of Consumer Services," ''The Service Industries Journal'', Vol. 13, no. 4, 1993, pp 179-200&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:US Navy 060513-N-5174T-045 Lt. Taylor Forester makes a few last minute decisions before purchasing a gold necklace from a Navy Exchange vendor aboard the Nimitz-class aircraft carrier USS Ronald Reagan (CVN 76).jpg|thumb|Search goods possess qualities that can be evaluated prior to consumption through direct inspection of the merchandise.]]

: ''Search goods'': are those which possess attributes that can evaluated prior to purchase or consumption. Consumers rely on prior experience, direct product inspection and other information search activities to locate information that assists in the evaluation process. Most products fall into the search goods category (e.g. clothing, office stationery, home furnishings).

: ''Experience goods'': are goods or services that can be accurately evaluated only after the product has been purchased and experiences. Many personal services fall into this category (e.g. restaurant, hairdresser, beauty salon, theme park, travel, holiday).

: ''Credence claims'': are goods or services that are difficult or impossible to evaluate even after consumption has occurred. Evaluation difficulties may arise because the consumer lacks the requisite knowledge or  technical expertise to make a realistic evaluation or, alternatively because the cost of information-acquisition is prohibitive or outweighs the value of the information available. Many professional services fall into this category (e.g. accountant, legal services, medical diagnosis/treatment, cosmetic surgery). These goods are called credence products because the consumer's quality evaluations depend entirely on the trust given to the product manufacturer or service provider.&lt;ref&gt;Jourdan, P., [http://acrwebsite.org/volumes/11342/volumes/ap04/AP-04 "Search Or Experience Products: an Empirical Investigation of Services, Durable and Non-Durable Goods"], in:  ''Asia Pacific Advances in Consumer Research '', Volume 4, Paula M. Tidwell and Thomas E. Muller (eds), Provo, UT, Association for Consumer Research,(2001), pp 167-174&lt;/ref&gt;

While some services may possess a number of search attributes (tangible dimensions), most services are high in experience or credence properties.  Empirical studies have shown that consumers' perceived risk increases along the search-experience-credence continuum.&lt;ref&gt;Mitra,K., Reiss, M.C. and Capella, L.M., "An Examination of Perceived risk, Information Search and Behavioral Intentions in Search, Experience and Credence Services", ''Journal of Services Marketing,'' Vol. 13, no.: 3, 1999, pp 208-228&lt;/ref&gt; The implication is that services tend to be high involvement decisions – where the consumer invests more heavily in information search activities during the purchase decision.

=== Risk perception and risk reduction in service purchase decisions ===
{{See also|Consumer behaviour}}

[[File:FGSQJ.jpg|thumb|Consumers are often nervous about air travel. Although the risk of a negative outcome is low, the severity of consequences is high in the event of a service failure.]]

Perceived risk is associated with all purchasing decisions, both products and services alike. In terms of risk perception, marketers and economists argue that perceived purchase risk is higher for [[experience good]]s and [[credence goods]] with implications for consumer evaluation processes.&lt;ref&gt;Zeithaml, V. A., ''How Consumer Evaluation Processes Differ Between Goods and Services,'' (1981), in:  ''AMA Conference Proceedings'', James H. Donnelly and William R. George (eds), Chicago IL: American Marketing Association, p. 186-190&lt;/ref&gt; Given that perceived risk drives the search for information in the pre-purchase stages of the consumer's decision process, consumers of services are more likely to engage in information acquisition activities as a means of ameliorating that risk. Any activity that a consumer undertakes in an effort to reduce perceived risk is known as a ''risk reduction activity''.

Risk perception has been defined as "a perception or feeling "based on consumer's judgments of the likelihood of negative outcomes (uncertainty) and the degree of importance of these outcomes to the individual [consequences]".&lt;ref&gt;Lovelock, C., Patterson, P. and Writz,J.,  ''Services Marketing: An Asia Pacific Perspective,'' Pearson, 2011 , p. 43&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, pre-purchase risk is a function of two dimensions, namely:

: ''Uncertainty'': the consumer's subjective assessment of the likelihood of occurrence 
: ''Consequence'': the severity of the outcome for the individual in the event that a poor purchase decision is made

For example, consider the case of a prospective air traveller. Most of us know that the probability of being involved in an airline disaster is low (low uncertainty).&lt;ref&gt;Ross, I., [http://acrwebsite.org/volumes/5741/volumes/v02/NA-02 "Perceived Risk and Consumer Behavior: a Critical Review"], in ''Advances in Consumer Research,''Volume 2, Mary Jane Schlinger (ed), MI, Association for Consumer Research, 1975, pp 1-20&lt;/ref&gt; It is conventional wisdom that travellers are safer in the air than on the roads. Statistically, you are much more likely to be involved in a vehicular accident that an aircraft disaster. While the likelihood of personal harm arising from air travel is indeed very low, the consequences or an airline disaster however are very serious indeed (high consequence).  Whereas, car travellers who have been involved in a traffic accident often walk away with minor injuries, the same cannot be said for airline travellers.  It is the severity of the consequence rather than the uncertainty that plays into airline passengers' fears. Consumers are constantly weighing up uncertainty and consequences to reach subjective evaluations of the overall risk attached to various purchase decisions.

Risk perception drives the information search process. Heightened risk perception may become a barrier to the natural progression of the purchase decision process and prevent customers from making a final brand choice. Consumers who are risk-averse tend to spend more time and effort engaged in information acquisition in the pre-purchase stage and look for specific types of information that will alleviate their perceptions of risk. Typical ''risk relievers'' might include such things as a reliance on personal sources of recommendation including word-of-mouth referrals; reliance on known and trusted brands, reading manufacturers' specifications, limited scale trial, reliance on warranties or guarantees etc.&lt;ref name="Dowling, G.R 1994, pp. 119-134"&gt;Dowling, G.R. and Staelin, R., "A Model of Perceived Risk and Intended Risk-Handling Activity," ''Journal of Consumer Research'', Vol. 21, No. 1, 1994, pp. 119-134&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mc Donalds Winterthur-Grüze Ladentheke.jpg|thumb|Standardisation, sometimes called the McDonald's approach, helps to reduce perceived risk because consumers can rely on a known product and quality.]]

Risk relievers that are especially relevant in service settings include:&lt;ref name="Dowling, G.R 1994, pp. 119-134"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, V-W.  and  Greatorex, M., "Risk Perception and Reduction in the Purchase of Consumer Services," ''Service Industries Journal'', 1993, pp 179-200&lt;/ref&gt;

:''High price maintenance:'' Some evidence suggests that risk-averse consumers often use high price as a guide to quality. Low prices may therefore be counter-productive since they suggest lower quality. Prestige pricing or premium pricing strategies are more likely to be indicated in service settings.

: ''Limited scale trial:'' While some services cannot be fully trialled, marketers should think about limited scale trial or a virtual trial. e.g. use computer-aided design to visualise hairstyles, plastic surgery, Many virtual brand sites found online have successfully built of the notion of limited trial.  Other examples include: test driving a software application.

:''Standardise the Product and Delivery:'' This is sometimes known as the McDonald's approach. Since variations in quality contribute to higher levels of perceived risk, one technique is to minimise variations by using production line techniques to control standards. This approach may be limited because many customers expect high levels of flexibility and customisation as part of the process. Standardisation needs to be fully communicated to customers – existing and potential – to be fully effective.

: ''Purchase from a known or trusted brand'': Consumers of services may be more predisposed to use a known, reputable brand as an indicator of quality merchandise. For this reason, service providers are presented with greater opportunities to engage in relationship marketing

===Matching supply and demand===

Service operations are often characterised by far more uncertainty with respect to the flow of demand. Service firms are often said to be ''capacity constrained''.&lt;ref name="Lovelock. C.H. 1984, pp 12-30"&gt;Lovelock. C.H., "Strategies for Managing Demand in Capacity -Constrained Service Organisations," ''Services Industries Journal,'' vol.4, no. 3, 1984, pp 12-30,&lt;/ref&gt;  This refers to the finite carrying capacity for most service operators and the lack of inventory which serves as a buffer against unexpected or peak demand.

There are two components to capacity (i.e., supply) in service operations:
:''Number of employees'':  In medium and high contact systems, capacity is constrained by the number of contact staff available to provide service.

:''Size of service environment'': Service environments have fixed space. A restaurant has a given number of tables, a hotel has a limited number of rooms, buses and trains are licensed to carry a specified number of passengers.

The factors contributing to uneven demand are more complex and difficult to predict. The components of demand may be seen as comprising long term demand patterns (trends), short term seasonal fluctuations and irregular effects.&lt;ref&gt;Australian Bureau of Statistics, [http://www.abs.gov.au/websitedbs/d3310114.nsf/4a256353001af3ed4b2562bb00121564/b81ecff00cd36415ca256ce10017de2f!OpenDocument ''Time Series: The Basics'']&lt;/ref&gt;

:''Long-term demand patterns:'' Most industries exhibit underlying trends in demand over longer time frames.  A trend is the long term direction in a time-series. Are sales growing, declining or stable? Often the trend in sales is related to the stage of the product life cycle. For example, industries in growth stages exhibit rapid increases in sales while industries in maturity may find that sales figures reach a plateau. Long-term demand patterns are stable and relatively easy to predict.

:''Seasonal Factors:'' Seasonal components are systematic, calendar-related movements in sales.  Seasonal factors are recurring and relatively easy to predict. Seasonal factors might include peak and off peak seasons for a tourist resort. For a restaurant, however, peak seasons might coincide with main meal periods on a daily basis.  Other seasonal factors include trading day trading day effects and holiday periods.

: ''Irregular Fluctuations:''  Irregular fluctuations are unsystematic, short term fluctuations. Irregular effects are highly unpredictable. e.g. inclement weather closes an airport, forcing local hotels to accommodate thousands of guests with minimal advance warning; an unexpected thunder storm leads to a surge in demand for umbrellas.

When demand is low, capacity may be under-utilised while excess demand places enormous pressures on the service system. Service managers need to develop strategies for managing demand and supply under different conditions. Strategies for managing capacity involve careful consideration of both demand-side considerations and supply-side considerations.&lt;ref&gt;Mudie, P. and Pirrie, A., ''Services Marketing Management,'' 3rd ed., Butterworth-Heinemann, 2006; especially see Chapter 8 "Demand &amp; Capacity Management" pp 157-176&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:McDonald's trash (4970792904).jpg|thumb|Using customers' labour to clean tables and dispose of rubbish, as in this McDonald's restaurant, reduces pressures on the operating system by freeing up employees to focus on core service activities.]]

On the capacity side:&lt;ref name="Lovelock. C.H. 1984, pp 12-30"/&gt;

:''Add to capacity'' – hire additional staff (e.g. casuals or temporary staff for peak periods); add to space (e.g. extra floor space in retail, hospitality or increased fleet size in transport services) Increasing capacity may require service re-design and presents a longer term solution to capacity problems.
:''Reconfigure interior space'' – with careful reconfiguration of interiors, it may be possible to accommodate a larger number of customers e.g. airline s to add to number of seats by reducing leg room.
:''Use Customers to Boost Productivity'' – Customers labour can be harnessed to reduce pressures on the system e.g. self-service, e-ticketing.
:''Transact business at arm's length'' – Use the internet or virtual delivery systems to transact business. 
:'' Ask Customers to use Third Parties'' – Where possible, have customers use agents or brokers to minimise the number of individual contacts and reduce pressure on the service system.
:'' Share capacity'' – it may be possible to share capacity with other businesses e.g. airlines build strategic alliances with other operators so that excess demand can be booked or referred to a known ally (and does not involve  passengers losing frequent flyer points).

On the demand side:&lt;ref&gt;Blois, Keith J., "Productivity and Effectiveness in Service Firms," ''Service Industries Journal,'' vol. 4 no. 3, 1984, pp 49-60&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Reception desk with a computer at a restaurant.JPG|thumb|Hotels and restaurants use computerised reservations systems to manage demand and supply.]]

:''Locate and target market segments with different demand patterns'' – e.g. a ski resort could develop fishing and sight-seeing packages for bushwalkers and anglers to build demand during traditional off peak seasons.
:''Develop innovative products for off peak periods'' – e.g. an airline could develop mystery flights, fly over Antarctica specials, singles flights, blues or jazz flights, gourmet flights, fight sensitivity training flights for nervous travellers, Winter wonderland specials, etc (a medium term strategy).
:''Use efficiency based pricing methods'' – price incentives, such as time-based differential pricing (peak and off peak); market-based differential pricing (e.g. economy and business class); price-volume discounts, use pricing to encourage pre-booking which facilitates superior forecasting  e.g. Car hire company, Uber, uses ''surge pricing'' during periods of high demand.
:''Use reservations systems to manage demand'' – ''yield management'' or ''dynamic pricing'' which uses a combination of segment-by-segment demand forecasting alongside subtle price adjustments (requires sophisticated software programs to analyse demand) e.g. hotels and airlines utilise yield management to set prices based on demand patterns.
:''Use stand-by systems'' – allow customers the option of taking up last minute vacancies or "no-show" places.
:''Shape demand''- management may attempt to shape demand patterns through customer education programs or lobbying e.g. encourage engaged couples to hold wedding ceremonies on days other than Saturday spread demand more evenly across the days of the week, lobby different state authorities to stagger scheduled school holiday periods in order to spread demand for holiday services more evenly across the year.

When demand exceeds capacity, then reductions in service quality are a probable outcome. Over-crowding and lengthy waiting lines potentially erode the customer experience and place stresses on employees and the service system. Employees may compensate by minimising the time spent with each customer in an effort to serve more people, but such responses have the potential to introduce human error into service delivery. When capacity far exceeds supply, then capacity becomes idle. Spare capacity is unproductive and an inefficient use of resources. A short-term solution to spare capacity is to seek reductions in operating costs. For instance, management might ask staff to take leave, reduce number of check in counters open, limit number lifts operating and close off entire floors of a building to reduce operating costs during off peak periods as a means of achieving cost savings. In addition, routine maintenance tasks or planned refurbishment activities, which involve downtime, should be carried out during off peak periods to minimise disruption to patrons.

====Managing waiting lines====

When demand exceeds capacity, customers may have to wait for services. Lovelock identifies a range of different types of waiting lines or queuing systems:&lt;ref&gt;Lovelock, C. H. Patterson, P. G. and Walker, R.H. (2007), Services Marketing: An Asia-Pacific Perspective, Pearson Education Australia, French's Forest, NSW, pp 288-289&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Types of queing systems.jpg|thumb|Different types of queues]]

: ''Single Line/ Single Server Queues'': Single line queues are among the most common. Examples can be found in cafes and sandwich bars around town. At Disneyland, for example, single line queues are employed despite the large numbers of visitors. However, Disney provides roving entertainers to visit waiting lines as a form of distraction.

: ''Parallel Lines/ Multiple Servers'': Parallel lines are useful when there is more than one service station. However a major drawback is lines often move at different speeds. When patrons perceive that their line is moving more slowly, it can give rise to a sense of inequity. A variation of this type of queue is to devote some stations to different classes of customer. This variation is used in supermarkets where an express lane can be set up for customers with a small basket of items. It is also used at airport check-in counters where different lines form for economy class passengers and business class passengers.

: ''Snake Queue'': The snake queue employs a physical race to guide customers through to the service station. Its main advantage is that all customers will be served on a first-in, first served basis, which for many people is the fairest system.

: ''Take a Number'': In the take a number system customers do not need to form orderly queues once they have been assigned a number. Instead, customers can relax, enjoy the service firm's facilities until their number is called.

: ''Other queue systems'': Of course, other types of system can be found in service environments. Hospital emergency department, for example, use ''[[Triage]]'' in which patients are assessed by a triage nurse who ranks the severity of their condition and assigns them to a doctor based on need.

{{See also|Marketing mix|E. Jerome McCarthy}}

The argument that services require different marketing strategies is based on the insight that services are fundamentally different to goods and that services marketing requires different models to understand the marketing of services to customers.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Eugene W., Claes Fornell, and Roland T. Rust, ''Customer Satisfaction, Productivity, and Profitability: Differences Between Goods and Services," ''Marketing Science,'' vol 16, no.2, 1997, pp 129-145.&lt;/ref&gt;  The "marketing mix" (also known as the ''four Ps'') is a foundation concept in [[marketing]] and has defined the so-called managerial approach since the 1960s.  The marketing mix or marketing program is understood to refer to the "set of marketing tools that the firm uses to pursue its marketing objectives in the target market".&lt;ref&gt;Kotler, P., ''Marketing Management'' (Millennium Edition), Custom Edition for University of Phoenix, Prentice Hall, 2000, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; The traditional marketing mix refers to four broad levels of marketing decision, namely: ''product'', ''price'', ''promotion'', and ''place''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McCarthy|first=Jerome E.|title=Basic Marketing. A Managerial Approach|year=1964|publisher=Irwin|location=Homewood, IL}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grönroos, Christian. "From Marketing Mix to Relationship Marketing: Towards a Paradigm Shift in Marketing," ''Management Decision,''  vol. 32, no.2, 1994, pp 4-20.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Expanded and modified marketing mix===

[[File:7 ps of services marketing.jpg|thumb|The seven Ps of services marketing]]

The prospect of expanding and modifying the marketing mix for services first took hold at the inaugural AMA Conference dedicated to Services Marketing in 1981, and built on earlier theoretical works pointing to many important limitations of the 4 Ps concept.&lt;ref&gt;Fisk, R.P., Brown, W. and Bitner, M.J., "Tracking the Evolution of Services Marketing Literature, ''Journal of Retailing'', vol. 41 (April), 1993&lt;/ref&gt; Taken collectively, the papers presented at that conference indicate that service marketers were thinking about a revision to the general marketing mix based on an understanding that services were fundamentally different to products, and therefore required different tools and strategies. At the Services Marketing Conference in 1981, Booms and Bitner proposed a model of seven Ps, comprising the original four Ps plus ''process, people'' and ''physical evidence'', as being more applicable for services marketing.&lt;ref&gt;Booms, B. and Bitner, M. J. "Marketing Strategies and Organizational Structures for Service Firms" in  James H. Donnelly and William R. George (eds), ''Marketing of Services'', Chicago: American Marketing Association, 47–51.&lt;/ref&gt; Since then there have been a number of different proposals for a service marketing mix (with various numbers of Ps – 6 Ps, 7 Ps, 8 Ps, 9 Ps and occasionally more). The model of 7 Ps has gained widespread acceptance, to the extent that some theorists have argued for the 7 Ps framework proposed by Booms and Bitner to be applied to products as a replacement for the four Ps.&lt;ref&gt;Rafiq,M. and Ahmed,P.K. "Using the 7Ps as a Generic Marketing mix: An Exploratory Survey of UK and European Marketing Academics", ''Marketing Intelligence &amp; Planning'', Vol. 13, no. 9, pp 4–15&lt;/ref&gt;

The extended marketing mix for services is more than the simple addition of three extra Ps. Rather it also modifies the traditional mix of product, price, place and promotion for superior application to services.

==== Product====

[[File:Total service product concept.jpg|thumb|Visualisation of the total service product concept]]

Service products are conceptualised as consisting of a bundle of tangible and intangible elements:&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman, K. D., Bateson, J.E.G., Elliot, G. and Birch, D., ''Service Marketing. Concepts, Strategies and Cases,'' Asia-Pacific Ed., Cengage Learning, Australia, 2010, pp 171-73&lt;/ref&gt;

: ''Core service:'' the basic reason for the business; that which solves consumer problems

: ''Supplementary goods and services:'' supplements or adds value to the core product and helps differentiate the service from competitors   (e.g. consultation, safe-keeping, hospitality, exceptions)

: ''Facilitating services'': (sometimes called ''delivery services''): Facilitate the delivery and consumption of the core service (are essential to delivery) (e.g. information provision, order-taking, billing, payment methods)

: ''Supporting services'':  support the core and could be eliminated without destabilising the core.

The distinction between supplementary and facilitating services varies, depending on the nature of the service. For instance, the provision of coffee and tea would be considered a supporting service in a bank, but would be a facilitating service in a bed and breakfast facility. Whether an element is classified as facilitating or supporting depends on the context.

==== Price====

Service marketers need to consider a range of other issues in price setting and management of prices:

* '''Price Charged:''' the traditional [[pricing]] decision. 
* '''Timing of Payment:''' Given that customers are part of the service process and that some customers remain in the process for days, months or even years (e.g. guest house, hotel stay, university tuition), decisions must be made about whether to request payment at time when the service encounter is initiated, during the encounter or on termination of an encounter. Deposits, installments and exit fees are all options that can be considered.
* '''Mode of Payment:''' Given that customers enter into long term relationships with service providers, it is possible that some patrons will expect to be able to pay on account. Payment options include: EFTPOS, direct transfer, cash/ credit cheque, invoice.

Many service firms operate in industries where price is restricted by professional codes of conduct or by government influences which may have implications for pricing. It is possible to identify three broad scenarios:&lt;ref&gt;Cowell, D., ''The Marketing of Services,'' pp 147-60&lt;/ref&gt;
* Services subject to public regulation (e.g. healthcare, public transport)
* Services subject to formal self-regulation  (e.g. universities, schools)
* Services Subject to regulation of marketplace  (e.g. hospitality, tourism, leisure services)
In situations where the service is subject to some type of public regulation, government departments may establish [[ceiling price]]s which effectively limit the amount that can be charged.

The concept of a ''social price'' may be more important for service marketers. A social price refers to "non financial aspects of price". Fine identifies four types of social price: Time, Effort, Lifestyle and Psyche.&lt;ref&gt;Fine, S.,''Social Marketing,'' Allyn and Bacon, 1991, Chapter 9&lt;/ref&gt; In effect, this means that consumers may be more acutely aware of the opportunity costs associated with the consumption of a service. In practice, this may mean that consumers of services experience a heightened sense of ''temporal risk.''

The most widely used pricing tactics in services marketing are: &lt;ref&gt;Kapoor, R., Paul, J. and Halder, B., ''Service Marketing: Concepts &amp; Practices'', Tata McGraw-Hill Education, 2011, p. 79;  Chowhan, S.E., ''Marketing of Services'', Lulu.com, 2015, pp 33-34&lt;/ref&gt;

* High or low [[Pricing#Differential pricing|differential pricing]]
* Flexible pricing
* [[Pricing#Diversionary pricing|Diversionary pricing]]
* [[Pricing#Offset pricing|Offset pricing]]
* [[Pricing#Guaranteed pricing|Guaranteed pricing]]
* [[Pricing#Loss leader|Loss leader]] pricing
* Discounted pricing

==== Place====
In making place decisions, there are several related questions which must be asked. What is the purpose of the distribution program? Who are the customers? Who should the intermediaries be?

* Purpose of Distribution: Mass distribution; selective distribution or exclusive distribution
* Number of levels in distribution channel: Direct distribution vs multi-marketing  and location decisions &lt;ref&gt;Donnelly, J.H., "Marketing Intermediaries in Channels of Distribution for Services," ''Journal of Marketing,'' vol. 40, January, 1976, pp 55 -70&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Light, D., "A Guide for New Distribution Channel Strategies for Service Firms," ''Journal of Business Strategy,'' vol. 7, Summer, 1986 and reproduced in John Bateson, ''Managing Services Marketing'', pp 427 -428&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Egan, D., "The Location of Service Outlets: An Economist's Perspective," ''Service Industries Journal,'' vol. 3, no. 2, 1983&lt;/ref&gt;
* Intermediaries: Agents versus Resellers; Brokers and other parties; Surrogate Consumers &lt;ref&gt;Bergen, M., Shanatu,D. and Walker, O.C., "Agency Relationships In Marketing," ''Journal of Marketing,'' vol. 56, July, 1992&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Solomon, M.R., " The Role of the Surrogate Consumer in Service Delivery," ''Service Industries Journal,'' vol. 9, no. 2, 1987, pp 292-307&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Promotion====

===The expanded marketing mix===

Contemporary service marketing texts tend to be organised around a framework of ''seven Ps'' or ''eight Ps.'' The 7 Ps comprises the original 4 Ps plus ''process'', ''people'', ''physical environment''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Booms|first=Bernard H.|author2=Bitner, Mary Jo|title=Marketing Strategies and Organization Structures for Service Firms|journal=Marketing of Services. American Marketing Association|year=1981 |pages=47–51}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''eight Ps'' framework; comprises the 7 Ps plus ''performance'' which refers to the standards of service performance or service quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kotler |first=Philip |title=Marketing Management |year=2012 |page=25 |publisher=Pearson Education}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Physical evidence====

Given the intangible nature of services, consumers often rely on the physical evidence to evaluate service quality. Therefore, service marketers must manage the physical evidence – which includes any element of the service environment which impacts on one or more of the customers five senses – the sense of smell, taste, hearing, sight and touch.&lt;ref&gt;Shostack, G.L., "Breaking Free from Product Marketing," ''Journal of Marketing,'' vol. 41, no. 2, 1977, pp 73-80&lt;/ref&gt; Theorists identify two types of physical evidence, namely;&lt;ref&gt;Shostack, G.L., "How to Design a Service," in Donnelly an, J.H. and George, W.R. (eds), ''Marketing of Services'', [AMA Special Conference on Services Marketing], American Marketing Association, Chicago. Ill, 1981, pp 221-29&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Credit-cards.jpg|thumb|Credit cards have no independent value unless backed by the service. Credit cards are a type of peripheral evidence.]]

:''Peripheral evidence:'' is actually possessed as part of the purchase of a service but has no independent value unless backed by the service.  e.g. a cheque book,  credit card, admission ticket, hotel stationery.
: ''Essential evidence:'' unlike peripheral evidence cannot be possessed by the client. It contributes to ambience or image e.g. building and furnishings, layout, equipment, people etc

A number of different theoretical traditions can be used to inform the study of service environments including stimulus-organism-response (SOR) models; [[environmental psychology]]; [[semiotics]] and Servicescapes.

=====Stimulus-response models=====
{{See also|Stimulus-response theory}}

The SOR model (stimulus→organism→response model) describes the way that organisms, which includes both customers and employees, respond to environmental stimuli. In a service setting the environmental stimuli might include lighting, ambient temperature, background music, layout and interior-design. In essence, the model proposes that people's responses exhibit both emotional and behavioural responses to stimuli in the external environment.

===== Environmental psychology=====
{{See also|Environmental psychology}}

[[File:Environmental psychology model.jpg|thumb|]]
Environmental psychologists investigate the impact of spatial environments on behaviour. Emotional responses to environmental stimuli fall into three dimensions; pleasure, arousal and dominance. The individual's  emotional state is thought to mediate the behavioural response, namely approach or avoidance behaviour towards the environment. Architects and designers can use insights from environmental psychology to design environments that promote desired emotional or behavioural outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;Donovan and Rossiter, J., "Store Atmosphere: An Environmental Psychology Approach," ''Journal of Retailing,'' Vol;. 58, no. 1, 1982, pp 34-57&lt;/ref&gt;

Three emotional responses are suggested in the model. These responses should be understood as a continuum, rather than a discrete emotion, and customers can be visualised as falling anywhere along the continuum.&lt;ref&gt;Ridgway, Dawson and Bloch (1990) "Pleasure and Arousal in the Marketplace: Interpersonal differences in approach-avoidance responses," ''Marketing Letters,'' vol 1, no 2, pp 139-47&lt;/ref&gt;

:''Pleasure–displeasure'' refers to the emotional state reflecting the degree to which consumers and employees are satisfied with the service experience.

:''Arousal–non-arousal'' refers to the emotional state that reflects the degree to which consumers and employees feel excited and stimulated.

:''Dominance–submissiveness'' refers to the emotional state that reflects the degree to which consumers and employees feel in control and able to act freely within the service environment.

[[File:Woolworths Closing-down Sale, Grimsby - geograph.org.uk - 1076911.jpg|thumb|Crowded, disorganised, unpredictable environments are said to be high load.]]

The individual's emotional response mediate the individual's behavioural response of ''Approach→ Avoidance.'' Approach refers to the act of physically moving towards something while avoidance interferes with people's ability to interact. In a service environment, approach behaviours might be characterised by a desire to explore an unfamiliar environment, remain in the service environment, interact with the environment and with other persons in the environment and a willingness to perform tasks within that environment. Avoid behaviours are characterised by a desire to leave the establishment, ignore the service environment, and feelings disappointment with the service experience. Environments in which people feel they lack control are unattractive. Customers often understand the concept of approach intuitively when they comment that a particular place "looks inviting". The desired level of emotional arousal depends on the situation. For example, at a gym arousal might be more important than pleasure (No Pain; No gain). In a leisure setting, pleasure might be more important. If the environment pleases, then the customer will be induced to stay longer and explore all that the service has to offer. Too much arousal can be counter-productive. For instance, a romantic couple might feel out of place in a busy, noisy and cluttered restaurant. Obviously, some level of arousal is necessary as a motivation to buy. The longer a customer stays in an environment, the greater the opportunities to cross-sell a range of service offerings.

Mehrabian and Russell identified two types of environment based on the degree of information processing and stimulation:&lt;ref&gt;Mehrabian,A. and Russell, J.A., ''An  Approach  to  Environmental  Psychology,'' Cambridge, MA, MIT  Press&lt;/ref&gt;

: ''High load'': Environments that are unfamiliar, novel, complex, unpredictable or crowded are high load

: ''Low load'':  Environments that are familiar, simple, unsurprising and well organised are low load.

Activities or tasks that are low load require a more stimulating environment for optimum performance. If the task to be performed in relatively simple, routine or boring then users benefit from a slightly more stimulating environment. On the other hand, tasks that are complex or difficult may benefit from a low load environment. In a service environment, a high load environment encourages patrons to enter and explore the various service offerings and spaces.

===== Servicescapes=====
{{See also|Servicescape}}
 
[[File:Servicescapes.pdf|thumb|Simplified servicescapes model]]

The servicescapes model was developed by Mary Jo Bitner and published in 1992. It is an applied model, specifically developed to inform the analysis of service environments, and was influenced by both stimulus-response theory and environmental psychology.

======Physical environment dimensions======

As the diagram of the servicescapes model illustrates, the service environment consists of physical environment dimensions which act as stimuli. Environmental simulis are normally considered as three broad categories including:&lt;ref&gt;Bitner, M.J., "Servicescapes: The Impact of Physical Surroundings on Customers and Employees," ''Journal of Marketing,'' vol. 56, no. 2, 1992, pp 57 -71&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Katz, K.L. and Rossiter, J.,  "Store Atmosphere: An Environmental Psychology Approach," in Bateson, J.E.G., ''Managing Services Marketing: Text, Cases and Readings'', Dryden, Orlando, Fl, 1991, pp 227-243&lt;/ref&gt;

: ''Ambient Conditions'': Temperature, air quality, ambient noise, lighting, background music, odor, etc

: ''Space/ Function'': Equipment such as cash registers, layout, furnishings and furniture, etc

: ''Signs, symbols &amp; Artefacts'': Directional signage, personal artefacts (e.g. souvenirs, mementos), corporate livery and logos, style of décor (including colour schemes), symbols etc

[[File:Savoy Boutique private seminar room - panoramio.jpg|thumb|The seminar room at the Savoy Hotel clearly signals an up-market positioning. Spacious room, high backed covered chairs, timber surfaces and a complementary bar combine to communicate that this in intended for corporate use.]]

Each element in the physical environment serves specific roles -and some may perform multiple roles. Signage may provide information, but may also serve to assist customers navigate their way through a complex service environment. For instance, furnishings may serve a functional role in that they provide seating, but the construction materials, such as fabric, tapestry and velvet may serve a symbolic role. Plush fabrics and generous drapery may suggest an elegant, up-market venue, while plastic chairs may signify an inexpensive, family-friendly venue.  When evaluating the servicescape, the combined effect of all the elements must also be taken into consideration.

======The holistic environment ======
When consumers enter a servicescape, they scan the ambient conditions, layout, furnishings and artefacts and aggregate them to derive an overall ''impression'' of the environment. In other words, the ''holistic environment'' represents the cumulative effect of multiple stimuli, most of which are processed within a split second. These types of global judgments represent the summation of processing multiple stimuli to form a single, overall impression in the consumer's mind.&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman, K. D., Bateson, J. E.G., Elliot, G. and Birch, D., ''Service Marketing. Concepts, Strategies and Cases,'' Asia-Pacific Edition, Cengage Learning Australia, 2010, pp 209-215&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Seminar room, Singapore University of Technology and Design - 20150602-02.jpg|thumb|The seminar room at Singapore University clearly signals an institutional application. Functional seating, ceiling mounted projectors, whiteboard, fluorescent lighting and schoolroom layout combine to suggest that the space is part of a practical educational environment.]]

Through careful design of the physical environment and ambient conditions, managers are able to communicate the service firm's values and positioning. Ideally, the physical environment will be designed to achieve desired behavioural outcomes. Clever use of space can be used to encourage patrons to stay longer since longer stays result in more opportunities to sell services. At other times, the ambient conditions can be manipulated to encourage avoidance behaviour. For example, at the end of a busy night of trading, a bar manager might turn the air conditioning up, turn up the lights, turn off the background music and start stacking chairs on top of tables. These actions send a signal to patrons that it is closing time.

======Customers and employees: moderating and mediating factors ======

Customers and employees represent the two groups that regularly inhabit the servicescape. Their perceptions of the environment are likely to differe, because each comes to the space with different purposes and motivations. For example, a waiter in a restaurant is likely to be pleased to see a crowded dining room because more customers means more tips. Customers, on the other hand, might be less pleased with a crowded space because the noise and queues have the potential to diminish the service experience.

In the servicescape model, a moderator is anything that changes the standard stimulus-response emotional states of pleasure-displeasure, arousal-non-arousal or dominance-submissiveness while the mediator explains the response behaviour, typically in terms of internal responses (cognitive, emotional and physiological responses).&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman, K.D. and Bateson, J.E. G., ''Services Marketing: Concepts, Strategies, &amp; Cases,'' Cengage, 2017, p. 215&lt;/ref&gt; The consumer's response to an environment depends, at least in part, on situational factors such as the purpose or reason for being in the environment.&lt;ref&gt;Bitner, M.J., "Servicescapes: The Impact of Physical Surroundings on Customers and Employees," ''Journal of Marketing,'' vol. 56, no. 2, 1992, pp 64-65&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a waiter in a restaurant is likely to be pleased to see a crowded dining room because more customers means more tips. Customers, on the other hand, might be less pleased with a crowded space because the noise and queues have the potential to diminish the service experience.

======Behavioural response======

The model shows that there are different types of response – individual response (''approach'' and ''avoid'')  and  interaction responses (e.g.''social interactions'').

In the context of servicescapes, ''approach'' has a special meaning.  It refers to how customers utilize the space, during and after the service encounter. Approach behaviours demonstrated during the encounter include:&lt;ref&gt;Bitner, M.J., "Servicescapes: The Impact of Physical Surroundings on Customers and Employees," ''Journal of Marketing,'' vol. 56, no. 2, 1992, pp 60-63&lt;/ref&gt;

: ''Enter and explore'' – exhibiting a desire to explore the total service offering, a willingness to do more things, keen to learn about all the company's products and services; showing an interest in [[cross-selling]] opportunities as presented

: ''Stay longer'' – exhibiting a willingness to remain within the physical environment; longer stays present more opportunities for cross-selling, up-selling or impulse buying. Some studies have shown a correlation between length of stay and the size of average patron expenditure

: ''Carry out plan'' – exhibiting a willingness to act on information provided, fully immerse themselves in the experience and a determination to achieve personal goals

: ''Social interactions'' refer to customer-employee interactions as well as customer-customer interactions. In some services, such as clubs, bars and tours, the act of meeting other people and interacting with other customers forms an integral part of the service experience. Managers need to think about design features that can be used to facilitate interactions between patrons. For instance, some cafeterias and casual dining establishments install communal dining tables for the express purpose of encouraging customers to mix and socialise.

[[File:CentralPark Vendor.JPG|thumb|Kiosks are lean servicescapes - simple, orderly, few employees, few spaces and familiar environments.]]

Different types of approach behaviours demonstrated at the conclusion of the encounter or after the encounter may include: ''affiliation'' – a willingness to become a regular user, form intention to revisit; ''commitment'' – the formation of intention to become brand advocate, to provide referrals, write favourable online reviews or give positive word-of-mouth recommendations.

======Types of servicescape======

Bitner's pioneering work on servicescapes identified two broad types of service environment:&lt;ref&gt;Bitner, M.J., "Servicescapes: The Impact of Physical Surroundings on Customers and Employees," ''Journal of Marketing,'' vol. 56, no. 2, 1992, pp 58-59&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Harrods Food Hall - geograph.org.uk - 908825.jpg|thumb|Department stores offer an elaborate servicescape with multiple levels and spaces, rich in physical elements and symbolism.]]
: ''Lean servicescapes'' – environments that comprise relatively few spaces, contain few elements and involve few interactions between customers and employees. e.g. kiosks, vending machines, self-service retail outlets, fast food outlets. Designing lean environments is relatively straight-forward

: ''Elaborate servicescapes'' – environments that comprise multiple spaces, are rich in physical elements and symbolism, involve high contact services with many interactions between customers and employees. Examples include international hotels and ocean liners with guest accommodation, concierge, bars, restaurants, swimming pools, gymnasiums and other supplementary services where guests interact with multiple personnel during their stay which might extend over multiple days. Designing elaborate environments requires skilled design teams who are fully apprised of the desired behavioural outcomes and the corporate vision.

According to the model's developer, the servicescape acts like a "product's package" – by communicating a total image to customers and providing information about how to use the service. It can also serve as a point of difference by signalling which segments of the market are served, positioning the organisation and conveying competitive distinctiveness.&lt;ref&gt;Bitner, M.J., "Servicescapes: The Impact of Physical Surroundings on Customers and Employees," ''Journal of Marketing,'' vol. 56, no. 2, 1992, p. 67&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Service process===

When customers enter a service firm they participate in a process. During that process, customers become quasi-employees; that is they are partial producers and they have the opportunity to see the organisation from the employee's perspective. To use a manufacturing analogy, customers are able to examine 'unfinished goods' – that is faulty and defective goods, glitches in the production system are in full view, with obvious implications for customer enjoyment and satisfaction. In addition, customers interactions with both employees and other customers becomes part of the total service experience with obvious implications for service quality and productivity.  Both customers and staff must be educated to effectively use the process. Controlling the service delivery process is more than a simple management issue. The customer's presence in the system means that the service process must be treated as a marketing issue.

====Blueprinting for design and diagnosis====

{{See also|Service blueprint}}

[[File:Service blueprint.jpg|thumb|A service blueprint for a hypothetical fast food outlet]]

Blueprinting is a technique designed to document the ''visible'' customer experience.&lt;ref&gt;Shostack, G. L., "Service Positioning through Structural Change," ''Journal of Marketing'', vol. 51, no. 1, 1987, pp 34-43&lt;/ref&gt; In its simplest form, the service blueprint is an applied process chart which shows the service delivery process from the customer's perspective. The original service blueprint is a highly visual, graphical map that delineates the key contact points in the service process and the nature of the contact – whether with physical evidence, personnel or procedures. It can be seen as a two dimensional map in which the horizontal axis represents time and the vertical axis represents the basic steps in the process.  A line of visibility is included to separate actions visible to the customer from actions out of sight.  Employee latitude, which refers to the amount of discretion given to employees to vary the service process, is shown on the map a call-out sign attached to the step a shown in the figure. Process complexity is shown simply by the number of steps in the process.

It was originally intended to be used as a tool to assist with service design and structural positioning.&lt;ref&gt;Shostack, G. Lynn. [http://hbr.org/1984/01/designing-services-that-deliver/ar/1 "Designing Services that Deliver"], ''Harvard Business Review'', vol. 62, no. 1 January - February 1984, pp 133–139&lt;/ref&gt;  However, since its inception it has been used extensively as a diagnostic tool, used to detect operational inefficiencies and potential trouble spots including ''fail points'' and ''bottlenecks''.&lt;ref&gt;Lovelock, C. H., "Managing Interactions Between Operations and Marketing and their Impact on Customers," in Bowen, D.E. Chase, R.B. and Cummings, T.G. (eds), ''Service Management Effectiveness. Balancing Strategy, organization and Human Resources,'' San Francisco, 1990, pp 343-69&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Swank, C. K., "The Lean Service Machine, ''Harvard Business Review'', vol. 81 no, 10, 2003, pp 123-129&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zeithmal, V. A. and Bitner, M.J., ''Services Marketing,'' Mc Graw-Hill, N.Y., 1996&lt;/ref&gt; In the event that any deficiencies are identified by the blueprinting process, management can develop operational standards for critical steps in the process.&lt;ref&gt;Womack, J. P. and Jones, D.  T. , "Lean Consumption," ''Harvard Business Review'', vol. 83, no. 3, 2005, pp 58-68&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zeithaml, V.A., Bitner, M. J. and Gremler, D. D. (2006), ''Services Marketing: Integrating Customer Focus Across the Firm'', 4th ed, Boston, MA, McGraw-Hill Irwin, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

When interpreting service blueprints, there are two basic considerations, complexity and divergence. ''Complexity'' refers to the number and intricacy of the steps required to perform the service. ''Divergence'' refers to the degree of latitude, freedom, judgment, discretion, variability or situational adaptation permitted within any step of the process. 
                  
Manipulations of the blueprint diagram might include increasing complexity, by adding more steps, or increasing divergence by allowing employees greater latitude in varying each step. In general, service processes that include high levels of employee discretion to vary steps to meet the needs of individual customers are moving towards customisation. On the other hand, reducing divergence, by standardising each step, often adds to complexity, but can result in a production-line approach to service process design. By manipulating complexity and divergence, it is possible to envisage four different positioning strategies:&lt;ref&gt;Shostack, G.L., "How to Design a Service," in Donnelly an, J.H. and George, W.R. (eds),  ''Marketing of Services'', [AMA Special Conference on Services Marketing], American Marketing Association, Chicago. Ill, 1981, pp 221-29&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Subway restaurant in the basement of Raffles City Shopping Centre, Singapore - 20060529.jpg|thumb|Customers doing the 'Subway shuffle' as they move along the race selecting their fillings. Subway has designed the store to facilitate a streamlined process.]]

: ''Reduced Complexity:'' Specialisation strategy
: ''Reduced Divergence:'' Volume-operations
: ''Increase Complexity:''  Product development
: ''Increased Divergence:'' Niche market strategy

Subway sandwich bars provide an excellent example of how a business can integrate both process design and the servicescape into the customer's in-store experience. Like many fast food restaurants, Subway utilises a ''race'' to corral customers and move them in a one-way direction. Prominently displayed 'In' and 'Out' signage reinforces the direction of the desired traffic flow. Customers can peruse an overhead backlit menu while they are waiting in line which speeds up the order-taking process and reduces opportunities for bottlenecks. Other signage provides customers with information about the Subway process e.g. select bread, select filling, select sauce, pay and exit. The arrangement of food behind the glass counter not only displays the choice of sandwich fillings, but supports the process since customers must select their preferences in a specific sequence, as they inch their way towards the cash register. In Australia, the distinctive moves used by Subway customers as they shuffle along the race, selecting their sandwich breads and fillings has become affectionately known as the ‘Subway shuffle'.&lt;ref&gt;''AdBrief'', [https://gotothesource.com.au/content/uploads/2013/02/ADB1792_pf.pdf "Campaign News"] [Australia], Issue no. 1792, 6 March 2009, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''AdNews'', [http://www.adnews.com.au/BC43A782-900D-4850-9710F17CDAB16B0D "Daily Round-Up"] 13 February 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Every aspect of Subway's store design and layout reinforces the core objectives of customisation, volume-operations (i.e. rapid turnover) and operational efficiency.

===People===

{{See also|Customer experience|Internal communications}}

The ''people'' dimension refers to the human actors who are participants in the service encounter, namely employees and customers.&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman, D., Bateson, J.E.G., Elliot, G. and Birch, S., Services Marketing: Concepts, Strategies and Cases (Asia-Pacific ed.), Cengage, 2010, pp 226-274&lt;/ref&gt; For many service marketers, the human interaction constitutes the heart of the service experience.&lt;ref&gt;Bateson, J. , ''Managing Services Marketing: Text, Cases and Readings,''  Orlando, Fl, Dryden, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; Service personnel are important because they are the ''face'' of the company and represent the company's values to customers. Customers are important because they are the reason for being in business and are the source of revenue. Service firms must manage interactions between customers and interactions between employees and customers.&lt;ref&gt;Zeithaml, V. Bitner, M.J. and Gremler, D.D., ''Services Marketing: Integrating Customer Focus Across the Firm,'' 6th ed, New York: McGraw-Hill, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars have developed the concept of service-profit-chain to understand how customers and firms interact with each other in service settings.&lt;ref&gt;Loveman, Gary W. "Employee satisfaction, customer loyalty, and financial performance an empirical examination of the service profit chain in retail banking," ''Journal of Service Research,'' vol. 1, no. 1, 1998, pp 18-31.&lt;/ref&gt; Strategically, service personnel are a source of differentiation.&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman, K.D. and  Bateson, J.E.G., ''Services Marketing: Concepts, Strategies, &amp; Cases,'' 5th ed., Boston, MA, Cengage, p.12&lt;/ref&gt;

Personnel are said to have a ''boundary-spanning role'' because they link the organisation with its external environment by interacting with customers and feed information back to the organisation&lt;ref&gt;Bateson, J. , ''Managing Services Marketing: Text, Cases &amp; Readings,''  Orlando, Fl, Dryden, pp 261-264&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bowen, D. E. and Schneider, B., "Boundary Spanning Role Employees and the Service Encounter," in Czepiel, J.A., Surprenant, C.F. and Solomon, M.A. (eds), ''The Service Encounter: Managing Customer Interactions in Service Businesses,'' Lexington Books, 1985&lt;/ref&gt; As boundary spanners, front line staff are likely to encounter the various stresses associated with that role.  Studies have shown that emotional labour can lead to undesirable consequences for employees including job-related stress, burnout, job dissatisfaction and withdrawal. If left untreated, these types of stressors can be very damaging to morale.

Managing the behaviour of customers and employees in the service encounter is difficult. Consistent behaviour cannot be prescribed. It can, however, be nurtured in subtle and indirect ways.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, P. J., "We the People: The Importance of Employees in the Process of Building Customer Experience," ''Journal of Brand Management,'' Vol. 15, pp 102-114, doi:10.1057/palgrave.bm.2550123&lt;/ref&gt;  Recruitment and training can help to ensure that the service firm employs the ''right'' people.

==== A dramaturgical perspective ====

{{See also|Symbolic interactionism|Emotional labor|Behavioral script}}

For some marketing theorists, services are analogous to theatre. This analogy is also known as a ''dramaturgical perspective.'' In such an analogy, service personnel are the ''actors'', customers are the ''audience''; uniforms are ''costumes''; the work setting is the ''stage'' (front-stage for areas where interaction occurs and ''back-stage'' for areas off limits to customers); discrete steps in the service process are ''scenes'' and finally the words and actions that occur represent the ''performance''.&lt;ref&gt;Grove, S.J., Fisk, R.P. and  John, J., "Services as Theater: Guidelines and Implications,"  in ''Handbook of Services Marketing and Management,'' Swartz, R., and Iacobucci, D (eds), Thousand Oaks, CA, Sage, 2000, pp 21-35&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grove, S.J., Fisk, R.P., [http://acrwebsite.org/volumes/7341/volumes/v19/NA-19 "The Service Experience As Theater"], in ''Advances in Consumer Research,'' Vol. 19, John F. Sherry, Jr. and Brian Sternthal (eds), Provo, UT, Association for Consumer Research, pp 455-461&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Flambeed (6655111493) (6).jpg|thumb|A waiter adds a touch of theatre to the service delivery.]]

A dramaturgical perspective may be appropriate in specific service contexts:

* high contact services&lt;ref&gt;Grove, S. J. and Fisk, R.P, "Impression Management in Services Marketing: A Dramaturgical Perspective," In ''Impression Management in the Organization,'' in  Robert A. Giacalone and Paul Rosenfeld, eds. Hillsdale, NJ, Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, pp 427-438&lt;/ref&gt;
* services with large audiences e.g. sporting stadia, educational institutions&lt;ref&gt;Halliday, D.V., Davies, B.J., Ward, P. and Lim, M., "A dramaturgical analysis of the service encounter in higher education," ''Journal of Marketing Management,'' Vol. 24, no.1-2, 2008 [Special issue, 'Creating the Service Experience'], pp 47-68, DOI; n https://dx.doi.org/10.1362/026725708X273911&lt;/ref&gt;

Managerial insights generated by a dramaturgical perspective include:&lt;ref&gt;Yagil, D., "Pretending and Dissembling: The Act of Service," [Chapter 1] In ''The Service Providers,'' Palgrave Macmillan, 2008, pp 11-41&lt;/ref&gt;

* differentiates services from manufactured goods – provides a framework and vocabulary for describing and evaluating service performances
* legitimises service work as a skilled performance – recognises that service work is an artistic and creative endeavour
* provides service workers with a mechanism for understanding and coping with role-related stressors (by understanding that they are 'in character' they are less likely to be personally affected by exchanges with difficult customers and the like) 
* focuses managerial attention on recruitment and training – recruiting people with requisite skills and training them as actors
* forces managers to think about the craft of stage management – scripting, staging, scenes, costumes and roles

When asked to perform emotional labour, employees can adopt one of two approaches:&lt;ref&gt;Verma, H.V., ''Services Marketing: Text and Cases,'' 2nd ed., India, Dorling Kindersley, p. 183&lt;/ref&gt;

:''Deep acting'': the service worker appraises the service environment and regulate their inner feelings, by actually changing their emotions from the outset

:''Surface acting:'' the service worker pretends to express displays of emotion that are consistent with rules and policies

Some evidence suggests that employees who are able to fully immerse themselves in the role and engage in deep acting are more resilient to role-related stress. In addition, deep acting is often seen as  more authentic, while surface acting can be seen as contrived and inauthentic.&lt;ref&gt;Liu, X, Xinmei, L. and Zizhen, G., "Emotional Labor Strategies And Service Performance: The Mediating Role Of Employee Creativity," ''The Journal of Applied Business Research,'' Vol. 29, No. 5, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Service work, by its very nature, is stressful for employees. Managers need to develop techniques to assist employees manage role related stress.

===Performance: Managing service quality===

{{See also|Service quality}}

There is widespread consensus amongst researchers and practitioners that service quality is an elusive and abstract concept that is difficult to define and measure.&lt;ref&gt;Berry,L.L., Zeithaml, V.A. and Parasuraman, A., "Quality counts in services, too," ''Business Horizons, May–June, 1985, pp 44-52&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed to be a multi-dimensional construct, but there is little consensus as to what consistutes the specific dimensions. Indeed, some researchers argue that the dimensions of service quality may vary from industry to industry and that no universal set of dimensions exists for all contexts.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, R.E., Hardgrave, B.C. and Jones, R.W., "SERVQUAL Dimensionality: An investigation of presentation order effect," International Journal of Services and Standards, Vol. 7, no. 1 DOI: 10.1504/IJSS.2011.040639&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the services marketing literature, there are several different theoretical traditions that inform the understanding of service quality including the Nordic school, the Gaps model (also known as the ''American model'' and the performance only approach.

====The Nordic school====

The Nordic school was one of the earliest attempts to define and measure service quality. In this school of thought, service quality is conceptualised as consisting of two broad dimensions, namely:&lt;ref&gt;Grönroos, C., "A service quality model and its marketing implications," ''European Journal of Marketing,'' Vol. 18, No. 4, 1984, 36–44. doi:10.1108/EUM0000000004784&lt;/ref&gt;

: ''Technical quality'': (What was delivered) 
: ''Functional quality'': (How it was delivered)

The technical dimension can usually be measured – but the functional dimension is difficult to measure due to subjective interpretations which vary from customer to customer.&lt;ref&gt;Grönroos, C., ''Service Management and Marketing: Managing the Moments of Truth in Service Competition,'' Lexington, Mass: Lexington Books, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Gaps model====
{{See also|SERVQUAL}}
[[File:Servqual.jpg|thumb|The model of service quality]]

The model of service quality or the ''gaps model'' as it is popularly known, was developed by team of researchers, Parasuraman, Zeithaml and Berry, in the mid to late 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Parasuraman, A, Ziethaml, V. and Berry, L.L., "SERVQUAL: A Multiple- Item Scale for Measuring Consumer Perceptions of Service Quality' ''Journal of Retailing,'' Vol. 62,  no. 1, 1988, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; and has become the dominant approach for identifying service quality problems and diagnosing their probable causes.&lt;ref&gt;Ladhari, R., "A Review of Twenty Years of SERVQUAL Research", International Journal of Quality and Service Sciences, Vol. 1 no. 2, pp 172–198&lt;/ref&gt; This approach conceptualises service quality  as a gap between consumer's expectations of a forthcoming service encounter and their actual perceptions of that encounter.&lt;ref&gt;Zeithaml, V., Parasuraman, A. and Berry, L.L., ''Delivering Service Quality: Balancing Customer Perceptions and Expectations,'' N.Y., The Free Press, 1990&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, service quality can be represented by the equation:&lt;ref&gt;Zeithaml, V.A., Berry, L.L. and Parasuraman, A., "Communication and Control Processes in the Delivery of Service Quality," ''Journal of Marketing,'' Vol. 52, No. 2, 1988, pp. 35-48&lt;/ref&gt;

'''SQ = P- E'''
: where;

: '''SQ''' is service quality
: '''P''' is the individual's perceptions of given service delivery
: '''E''' is the individual's expectations of a given service delivery

The model which provides the overall conceptual framework helps analysts to identify the service quality gap (Gap 5 in the model) and to understand the probable causes of service quality related problems (Gaps 1-4 in the model). The diagnostic value of the model accounts at least, in part, for the instrument's continuing currency in service quality research.&lt;ref&gt;Asubonteng, P., McCleary, K.J. and Swan, J.E.,  "SERVQUAL Revisited: A Critical Review of Service Quality", ''Journal of Services Marketing,'' Vol. 10, no 6, 1996, pp 62-81&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ladhari, R., "A review of twenty years of SERVQUAL research", ''International Journal of Quality and Service Sciences,'' Vol. 1 no. 2, pp. 172–198&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nyeck, S., Morales, M., Ladhari, R., &amp; Pons, F., "10 Years of Service Quality  Measurement: Reviewing the use of the SERVQUAL Instrument," ''Cuadernos de Difusion,'' Vol. 7, no 13, pp 101-107.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Measuring service quality using SERVQUAL model (Kumar et al, 2009).png|thumb|The five dimensions of service quality]]

The model's developers also devised a research instrument, called SERVQUAL, to measure the size and direction of service quality problems (i.e. gap 5).&lt;ref&gt;Parasuraman, A., Berry, L.L. and Zeithaml, V.A.,  "Refinement and Reassessment of the SERVQUAL scale," ''Journal of Retailing,'' Vol. 67, no. 4, 1991, pp 57-67&lt;/ref&gt; The questionnaire is multi-dimensional instrument, designed to  having capture five dimensions of service quality; namely reliability, assurance, tangibles, empathy and responsiveness, which are believed to represent the consumer's understanding of service quality. The questionnaire consists of matched pairs of items; 22 expectation items and 22 perceptions items, organised into the five dimensions which align with the consumer's mental map of service quality dimensions. Both the expectations component and the perceptions component of the questionnaire consist a total of 22 items, comprising 4 items to capture tangibles, 5 items to capture reliability, 4 items for responsiveness, 5 items for assurance and 5 items to capture empathy.&lt;ref&gt;Based on Parasuraman, A, Ziethaml, V. and Berry, L.L., "SERVQUAL: A Multiple- Item Scale for Measuring Consumer Perceptions of Service Quality' Journal of Retailing, Vol. 62, no. 1, 1988, [Appendix: SERVQUAL questionnaire, pp 37-40&lt;/ref&gt; The questionnaire, which is designed to be administered in a face-to-face interview and requires a moderate to large size sample for statistical reliability, is lengthy and can take more than one hour to administer to reach respondent. In practice, researchers customarily add extra items to the 44 SERVQUAL items to capture information about the respondent's demographic profile, prior experience with the brand or category and behavioural intentions (intention to revisit/ repurchase, loyalty intentions and propensity to give word-of-mouth referrals). Thus, the final questionnaire may have up to 60 items, which contributes to substantial time and cost in terms of administration, coding and data analysis.

====Performance-only model====

Cronin and Taylor developed a scale based on perceived performance only (i.e. excluded expectations) as a simpler alternative to SERVQUAL.&lt;ref&gt;Cronin, J. J. and Taylor, S. A., "Measuring Service Quality: A Re-examination and Extension," ''Journal of Marketing,'' Vol. 56, no. 3, 1992 pp 55-68&lt;/ref&gt; The scale is known as SERVPERF and is considerably shorter than SERVQUAL, and therefore easier and cheaper to administer. Results from the use of SERVPERF correlate well with SERVQUAL.&lt;ref&gt;Cronin J.J., Steven, J. and Taylor, A., "SERVPERF versus SERVQUAL: Reconciling performance based and perceptions-minus-expectations measurement of service quality," ''Journal of Marketing,'' Vol. 58, January, 1994, pp 125-131&lt;/ref&gt; This approach utilises a different conceptualisation of service quality, which can be represented by the equation:

'''SQ = P'''
: where;

: '''SQ''' is service quality
: '''P''' is the individual's perceptions of given service delivery

Although SERVPERF has a number of advantages in terms of administration, it has attracted criticism. The performance only instrument lacks the diagnostic value of the SERVQUAL since it includes only one variable (P) compared to SERVQUAL's richer data with two variables (P and E).&lt;ref&gt;Elliott, K. M., "SERVPERF versus SERVQUAL: A Marketing  Management Dilemma when Assessing Service Quality," ''Journal of Marketing Management,'' Vol. 4, no. 2, 1994, pp 56-61&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carrillat, F.A., Jaramillo, F. and Mulki, J.P., "The Validity of the SERVQUAL and SERVPERF Scales: A Meta‐analytic View of 17 years of Research across Five Continents", ''International Journal of Service Industry Management,'' Vol. 18, no. 5, 2007, pp 472-490&lt;/ref&gt; To illustrate, consider one source of quality related problems which occurs when customers have unrealistically high expectations. SERVQUAL has no problem detecting such problems, however, SERVPERF can never detect this problem because it does not capture expectations. When choosing an appropriate instrument for investigations into service quality, service marketers must weigh up the expediency of SERVPERF against the diagnostic power of SERVQUAL.

==Services dominant logic: implications for theory and practice==
{{See also|Service-dominant logic}}

Service-dominant logic (SDL) is a new way of thinking about marketing, especially the goods versus services division and especially a fresh way of thinking about customer value and the value-creation process. Vargo and Lusch did not intend for service-dominant logic to be published as a workable theory that offers solutions to everyday marketing problems and issues. Instead, it offers a framework for thinking about goods and services. Their work did not put forward hypotheses that could be tested empirically, Instead they offer "foundational propositions."  The original article offered eight such propositions&lt;ref&gt;Vargo, S. L. and Lusch, R.F., "Evolving to a New Dominant Logic for Marketing," ''Journal of Marketing,'' vol 68, no. 1, 2004, pp 1-17.&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequently added two more propositions to arrive at a total of ten:&lt;ref&gt;Vargo, S. L. and Robert F. Lusch, "Service-dominant Logic: Continuing the Evolution",  ''Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science,'' Vol. 36, no. 1, 2008, pp 1-10&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the implications that have been identified in the literature include:

''SDL offers the promise of a unified marketing theory'': To date, marketing research and practice have failed to integrate the traditional goods/services dichotomy. Some efforts have been made to get product accepted as a joint term for goods and services and to use offering, package or solution as all inclusive, concepts for what consumers the buys, but this has not been successful.&lt;ref&gt;Gummesson, E., "Exit Services Marketing- Enter Service Marketing," in: Michael Baker and Susan Hart (eds), ''The Marketing Book'', 6th edition, Butterworth-Heinemann, 2008, pp 451-471&lt;/ref&gt; Service-dominant logic, however, promises a truly unified framework. For many academics, this is the most exciting implication. It is highly likely that the 4 Ps, as the central marketing framework, is about to come to a close.

''Compete Through Innovative Co-production and Co-creation'': Some theorists point out that, thanks largely to the Internet, consumers have been actively engaging themselves in explicit dialogue with manufacturers and service providers.&lt;ref&gt;Prahalad, C.K. and Ramaswamy, V. (2000) "Co-opting Customer Competence," ''Harvard Business Review,'' vol. 78, no. 1, pp 79-87&lt;/ref&gt; The challenge is for service firms to find innovative ways to achieve co-production and co-creation. Customer co-creation has become the foundation concept for social sharing web sites such as YouTube, Myspace and Twitter.  Many companies have moved from testing products in the contrived and artificial conditions of a laboratory to product testing in customer environments. At Microsoft, for example, consumers acted as product researchers by testing Windows 2000 in their native environments. A different approach is to use embedded intelligence to provide enhanced personalised experiences.

''Research Priorities'': SDL has forced the discipline to review its research priorities.  Researchers and scholars are beginning to identify a range of subjects that require more detailed exploration. Some theorists have argued that marketing practitioners must find new ways of understanding customers' value creation and of developing marketing strategies with an aim to engage suppliers with their customers' consumption processes in order to enhance customer satisfaction.&lt;ref&gt;Vargo, S.L., "Customer Integration and Value Creation: Paradigmatic Traps and Perspectives," ''Journal of Service Research,'' vol. 11, no. 2, 2008, pp 211-215.&lt;/ref&gt; Other research priorities include: the personalised customer experience,&lt;ref&gt;Lusch, R.F., Vargo, S.L. and O'Brien, M., "Competing through Service: Insights from Service-dominant Logic," ''Journal of Retailing,'' Vol. 83, no. 1, 2007, pp 5-18&lt;/ref&gt; resource integration,&lt;ref&gt;Baron, S.  and Harris, K. "Consumers as Resource Integrators," ''Journal of Marketing Management,'' vol. 24, no. 1/2, 2008, p113-130&lt;/ref&gt; improved use of IT to map processes and activities in order to increase productivity and standardise service.

==History==

The Colony was founded by Joseph Pani, who later sold it to his employees &lt;ref name="Grimes"/&gt; Ernest Cerutti, Alfred Hartmann, and Gene Cavallero, Sr. At first, it was known for attracting playboys trolling for dates with its upstairs gambling club where men could meet their mistresses, but after Mrs. [[William K. Vanderbilt]] discovered it, it became the fashionable haunt of New York high society.&lt;ref name="collins"/&gt;

Mayor [[Jimmy Walker]]'s victory celebration was held at the Colony in 1925. The Colony served liquor during [[Prohibition in the United States|prohibition]], serving it in cups rather than glasses, and keeping its liquor in a service elevator where it could easily be moved, though Mayor Walker protected the restaurant from raids.&lt;ref name="collins"/&gt;

The Colony installed [[air conditioning]] in the late 1920s, the first restaurant in New York to have it; it was also the first in the U.S. to serve [[Dom Pérignon (wine)|Dom Pérignon]] champagne.&lt;ref name="collins"/&gt;

{{Rquote|right|The Colony had great American chic, in the sense of Cole Porter. And it was full of stylish people. So I got the idea of sending a photographer—usually Tony Palmieri—to stand outside the restaurant at lunchtime, to find out what was going on and to see what they were wearing.|[[John Fairchild (editor)|John Fairchild]], editor of ''[[Women's Wear Daily]]'', 1960s&lt;ref name="collins"/&gt;}}

Among its famous customers were [[Reginald Vanderbilt]], [[Gloria Vanderbilt]], [[Russell Ryder]], [[Preston Sturges]], [[Mike Todd]], [[Fulco di Verdura]], [[Hattie Carnegie]], [[Carmel Snow]], [[Kitty Carlisle Hart]], [[Cordelia Biddle Robertson]], Mr. and Mrs. [[Rhinelander Stewart]], [[Elsie de Wolfe]], [[Groucho Marx]], [[Ellin Mackay|Mrs. Irving Berlin]], [[Millicent Rogers]], [[Barbara Hutton]], [[Doris Duke]], [[Betsey Whitney]], [[George Washington Vanderbilt III|George Vanderbilt]], [[Lulu Vanderbilt]], [[Samuel Newhouse]], [[Marlene Dietrich]], [[Lulu Balcom]], [[Lucius Beebe]], [[Rosalind Russell]], [[Gary Cooper]], [[Carol Channing]], [[Richard Nixon]], [[C.Z.

When it closed on December 4, 1971, many of its faithful patrons came: [[Truman Capote]], [[Diana Vreeland]], ....&lt;ref name="collins"/&gt; The building it was in has since been demolished.&lt;ref name="collins"/&gt;

[[Sirio Maccioni]] was the bar captain at the Colony from 1960 to 1970.&lt;ref name="collins"/&gt;

Competitors of the Colony included the [[21 Club]], [[Le Pavillon]], [[Restaurant LaRue]], and later the [[Four Seasons (restaurant)|Four Seasons]].&lt;ref&gt;William Grimes, ''Appetite City: A Culinary History of New York Hardcover'', 2009, p. 153&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Trustees of Labour''' ({{lang-de|Treuhänder der Arbeit}}) were government-appointed officials in [[Nazi Germany]] in charge of [[labour relations]] supervised by the [[List of German labour ministers|Reich Ministry of Labour]]. Established by the Trustees of Labour law (''{{lang|de|Gesetz über Treuhänder der Arbeit}}'') of 19 May 1933, the Trustees of Labour were responsible for ''the maintenance of industrial peace'', i.e., defining minimum (and from 1938 also maximum) wages, resolving individual conflicts and overseeing the establishment of [[Council of Trust|Councils of Trust]] (''{{lang|de|Vertrauensräte}}'') in businesses and companies as mandated by the [[Labour organization law]] (''{{lang|de|Arbeitsordnungsgesetz}}'') of 20 January 1934.

==Reviews and criticism==
According to [[Neil Genzlinger]], of ''[[The New York Times]]'', "Before [Walt Disney] became synonymous with a staid, [[Whitewash (censorship)|whitewashed version]] of [[Americana]], [he] was considered a boundary pusher, expanding the possibilities and ambitions of his art form ... [the documentary film is] a workmanlike treatment of a titanic life ... [and] makes you feel the limitations of the familiar '[[American Experience]]' format: no-nonsense narration; archival footage and photographs; [[Pundit|talking heads]] delivering sound-bite-length flourishes."&lt;ref name="NYT-20150914" /&gt; Cynthia Littleton, of [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]], writes that "Walt Disney was a dictator who ruled his studio with an iron fist. Walt Disney was a generous soul who loved nothing more than making people happy. Both of those sides of the man who has achieved mythic status were on display [in the documentary film]."&lt;ref name="VM-20150802" /&gt; [[Neal Gabler]], author of the biography "''Walt Disney: The Triumph of the American Imagination''” (2006), notes that “the film takes the measure of [Walt Disney] as a human being."&lt;ref name="LADN-20150914" /&gt;
