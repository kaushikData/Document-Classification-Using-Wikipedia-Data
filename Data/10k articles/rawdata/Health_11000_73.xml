      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3638">In [[audiology]], the '''Articulation Index (AI)''' is a tool used to predict the amount of [[speech]] that is audible to a [[patient]] with a specific [[Deafness|hearing loss]]. The AI figure for a given patient can range from zero to one, representing the [[proportionality (mathematics)|proportion]] of the average speech signal that is audible. The closer the AI is to one, or [[percentage|100 percent]], the better the person should be able to hear speech. The calculation is also used in [[Industrial design|industrial settings]] for the design of safety devices, such as [[flight helmet]]s, where audio signals are required to be clearly heard.

==Clinical use==
The AI is often used as a counseling tool since it presents an individual’s hearing loss in terms of percentage of speech missed during a typical one-on-one conversation. The AI can also be used to measure the effectiveness of [[hearing aid]]s and other forms of amplification devices. 

Since the creation of the AI, there have been several proposed ways to simplify and increase its use. In 1990, Gustav Mueller and Mead Killion proposed an AI [[calculation]] involving one hundred dots on an [[audiogram]], each of which represented an important speech [[Audio frequency|frequency]]; the proportion of dots audible to the listener estimates the patient's AI. Unfortunately, not all areas on the audiogram (taking into account frequencies and intensity levels) are equally weighted. According to this procedure, the highest density of the audiogram dots is concentrated in the frequency region of 1-3 [[hertz|kHz]], since this is the region containing the most speech information.

==Industrial use==
In many industrial settings noise exposure metrics have been established to quantify human exposure to sound. In [[aerospace]] settings the Speech Intelligibility Index (SII), published in 1986 by the [[American National Standards Institute]], is a major revision of the AI standard and defines computational methods "that produce highly correlated with the intelligibility of speech under a variety of adverse listening conditions, such as noise masking, filtering and reverberation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Fundamentals of Aerospace Medicine |author1=Jeffrey R.

The  '''Asthma and Bronchitis Association of India''' (ABAI) was founded in 1984 at the [[pulmonary function testing|pulmonary function laboratory]] of [[St George Hospital, Mumbai|St. George's Hospital]] in [[Mumbai]]. It is one of the earliest [[nonprofit organization|nonprofit]], [[non-governmental organization]]s solely dedicated to improving education and awareness for all [[asthma]] and [[allergy]] patients in [[India]].  It organizes several activities famed at improving asthma patients' well-being, including:

* An annual trek
* Annual sports meet
* Health check-up scheme for members
* Provision of [[metered-dose inhaler|emergency inhalers]] at a discount rate
* [[Nebulizer]]s for rent at minimal cost
* Newsletter (''Asthma Times'') offering information on asthma and asthma care
* [[Anti-tobacco movement|Anti-tobacco campaigns]]
* Asthma camps and community programmes

The association also works to increase awareness about asthma in India, particularly in Mumbai.  It has published articles in newspapers including [http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-10-22/mumbai/30310144_1_asthma-patients-asthma-attacks-october-heat The Times of India&lt;ref name=Times&gt;{{cite news|last=Masand|first=Pratibha|title=Asthma|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-10-22/mumbai/30310144_1_asthma-patients-asthma-attacks-october-heat|newspaper=Times of India|date=2011-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;], [http://www.mumbaimirror.com/article/2/20100304201003040302247981563e699/Construction-dust-%E2%80%98chokes%E2%80%99-12-pc-of-kids-.html Mumbai Mirror&lt;ref name=Mirror&gt;{{cite news|last=Shukla |first=Alka |title=Dust Asthma |url=http://www.mumbaimirror.com/article/2/20100304201003040302247981563e699/Construction-dust-%E2%80%98chokes%E2%80%99-12-pc-of-kids-.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130129083324/http://www.mumbaimirror.com/article/2/20100304201003040302247981563e699/Construction-dust-%E2%80%98chokes%E2%80%99-12-pc-of-kids-.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-01-29 |accessdate=19 February 2012 |newspaper=Mumbai Mirror |date=4 March 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ],  [http://www.dnaindia.com/mumbai/report_pollutants-mumbai-s-biggest-cause-for-concern-doctors_1359532 DNA&lt;ref name=DNA&gt;{{cite news|last=Suryanarayan|first=Deepa|title=Mumbai Pollutants|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/mumbai/report_pollutants-mumbai-s-biggest-cause-for-concern-doctors_1359532|newspaper=DNA|date=2010-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;], Hindustan Times, and many others.

The association has over 10,000 registered members and over 500 active volunteers. It has 3 reputed [[pulmonology|chest physicians]] and asthma specialists on its core panel. Though it still operates from its initial location at St. George's Hospital, ABAI has another satellite office at the [http://asthmaallergyclinic.com Asthma Allergy Clinic] in central Mumbai.

'''Autophagia''' (eating one's own body) is not classified as a [[mental disorder]] or a [[symptom]] of a mental disorder in the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' (DSM), the diagnostic manual used in the United States. However, Autophagia could be classified under the DSM's Impulse-Control Disorders Not Elsewhere Classified. Impulse-Control Disorders involve failing to resist an impulse, drive, or temptation to perform an act that is harmful to the person or to others. The majority of individuals affected by this disorder will often feel a sense of tension or arousal before committing the act, and then experience pleasure, gratification or relief at the time of committing the act. Once the act has been completed, the individual may or may not feel regret, self-reproach, or guilt.&lt;ref&gt;American Psychiatric Association. (2000). Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (4th ed., text rev.). Washington, DC: Author.&lt;/ref&gt;

Autophagia occurs when one is compelled to inflict pain upon oneself by biting and/or devouring portions of one's body. It is sometimes seen with [[schizophrenia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Koops E, Püschel K |title=[Self-mutilation and autophagia] |language=German |journal=Arch Kriminol |volume=186 |issue=1-2 |pages=29–36 |year=1990 |pmid=2278506 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[psychosis]] and [[Lesch–Nyhan syndrome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Frost FS, Mukkamala S, Covington E |title=Self-inflicted finger injury in individuals with spinal cord injury: an analysis of 5 cases |journal=J Spinal Cord Med |volume=31 |issue=1 |pages=109–16 |year=2008 |pmid=18533422 |pmc=2435035}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar behavior has been observed in laboratory rats in experiments looking at spinal cord and peripheral nerve injuries. The resulting behavior consists of the rats licking and then chewing their nails, and the tips of their toes. In extreme cases, the rats will chew off whole toes or even the foot.&lt;ref&gt;De Medinaceli, L., and R. J. Wyatt. 1988.

Atweh, and S. J. Jabbur. 1993. The role of previous nociceptive input in development of autotomy following cordotomy. Exp. Neurol. 119:280-286.&lt;/ref&gt; In order to get rid of this behavior, researchers applied a series of evaporative, bitter-tasting mixtures (combination of Metronidazol and New Skin) on the rat's limb because most animals avoid chewing anything with a bitter taste. After testing this mixture on 24 rats with spinal cord injuries, only one rat had chewed its toes after a 2-3 week period.&lt;ref&gt;Zhang, Y. P., Onifer, S. M., Burke, D. A., &amp; Shields, C. B.

[[Laboratório Enila, Brazil|Laboratório Enila]] was a small [[Brazil]]ian pharmaceutics manufacturer who made an oral [[radiocontrast|X-ray contrast medium]] trademarked Celobar. The medium's main ingredient was pharmaceutics-grade [[barium sulfate]] (BaSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) imported from [[Germany]]. In 2003, without having the necessary expertise or authorization, they tried to manufacture BaSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; in-house from much-cheaper technical-grade [[barium carbonate]] (BaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;).

Non-reacted carbonate and other barium salts that remained in the adulterated product killed nine patients. The first death was Ricardo Diomedes, who had taken Celobar on May 21, 2003 at a clinic in [[Nova Iguaçu]] near [[Rio de Janeiro]]. A few hours later he was suffering from vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pains, and weakness; he died the next day in [[Nilópolis]]. Postmortem exams confirmed that barium poisoning was the cause of death. Analysis of the Celobar by the [[Oswaldo Cruz Institute]] showed up to 14% unreacted carbonate (the maximum allowed limit being 0.001%).&lt;ref name="folha"/&gt; The other eight deaths occurred in the state of [[Goiás]], where most of the contaminated lot had been shipped. (Coincidentally the same state as the [[Goiânia accident]].)

Authorities were warned after the first deaths, recalled the lot, and closed the laboratory, which eventually went bankrupt.

On January 29, 2009, Enila's CEO (Márcio D'Icahahy Câmara Lima), and the chemist who carried out the synthesis (Antônio Carlos Fonseca da Silva) were sentenced to 20 and 22 years in jail, respectively.&lt;ref name="jus"/&gt;&lt;ref name="folha"/&gt;

McPhee has been cited in numerous newspaper and magazine articles about dreams and dream interpretation, including ''[[The New York Times]]'' and ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''. In addition to appearing as a dream expert on CNN, he was the host of the popular Dream Doctor Radio Show, heard weeknights for six years across the country, during which he interpreted thousands of dreams.

== Radio show ==

McPhee hosted the popular Dream Doctor Radio Show for six years. The show started on KRUZ-FM (HOT AC) in Santa Barbara, California, in 2000. In two years, the show became the #1 show in the market for its time slot for adults aged 25–54. In October 2002, [[Cox Radio]] signed McPhee and moved the show to Atlanta. The show, featuring [[Adult contemporary music|adult contemporary (AC) music]] and four dream interpretations per hour, was expanded to five hours every weeknight. Emanating from flagship WSB-FM (Soft AC), the show was picked up by FM AC music stations in major markets, including Miami, Denver, Minneapolis, Salt Lake City, San Antonio, and Tampa. Cox made was among the first syndicators to provide a customizable FTP version of the show for stations that wanted to play their own music and format the show with more dream interpretations.

The radio stations that ran more dream interpretations did markedly better than those that did not. The show did well, but audience research revealed that there was a problem with the show. The audience far preferred listening to McPhee and his dream interpretations than to the music. In 2004, McPhee's manager, George Oliva, started a radio syndication company, Springhill Syndication, to distribute a version of the show without music. He moved McPhee back to California and launched the new three-hour talk show on November 11, 2004. The program was picked up by newstalk, talk, and even music stations in markets that included Houston, Minneapolis, Salt Lake City, Las Vegas, West Palm Beach, Monterrey, and Hartford. A one-minute feature devoted to the meaning of the most common dream symbols played in a number of markets, including New York and Los Angeles. A weekend show expanded the reach of the Dream Doctor to markets that included San Francisco and Hartford.

In March 2006, McPhee became aware of problems with his voice. After a number of tests, he was diagnosed with probable [[Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis|amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)]] (Lou Gehrig's disease) in June 2006. After the diagnosis was confirmed in August 2006, McPhee announced the news to his audience that he had Bulbar ALS, a severe form of the disease. The final Dream Doctor Radio Show was broadcast on October 20, 2006.

== Web site ==

McPhee launched www.dreamdoctor.com in 1997. It was among the first sites on the Internet devoted entirely to providing credible information about dreams and sleep. Through it, he had amassed the largest database of dreams in the world. With it, he broke their code. Taking a scientific approach to dream interpretation and understanding, he used the database to arrive at his findings about dreams, all of which are evidenced in his writings, radio show, and web site.  He concluded that everyone dreams in the same language of dream symbols, regardless of age, gender, geography, culture, religion, or native language. As all languages evolve and are influenced by contextual realities ranging from personal experience to regionalisms, so, contended McPhee, does the language of dreams. He added that what makes every dream unique and specific to the dreamer is the waking life background that generated the dream.

Due to his illness and its increasingly severe physical limitations, McPhee focused his professional efforts on his web site. In August 2009, the site was upgraded.  In addition to thousands of free pages of information about dreams and sleep, it now gives users access to audio and video clips of McPhee as well as a unique dream interpretation tool called the Dream Wizard.

'''Child psychopathology''' refers to the scientific study of [[mental disorder]]s in children and adolescents. [[Oppositional defiant disorder]], [[attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder]], and [[autism spectrum disorder]] are examples of [[psychopathology]] that are typically first diagnosed during childhood.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=T3zarJqFDbwC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;ots=-WVY2ngchy&amp;dq=Child%20psychopathology&amp;pg=PA4#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Child Psychopathology] - 2nd Edition, Mash &amp; Barkley&lt;/ref&gt; Mental health providers who work with children and adolescents are informed by research in [[developmental psychology]], clinical child psychology, and family systems. Lists of child and adult mental disorders can be found in the [[ICD-10|International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th Edition]] (ICD-10), published by the World Health Organization (WHO) and in the [[DSM-5|''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders'', Fifth Edition]] (DSM-5), published by the American Psychiatric Association (APA). In addition, the ''[[Diagnostic Classification of Mental Health and Developmental Disorders of Infancy and Early Childhood]]'' (DC: 0-3R) is used in assessing mental health and developmental disorders in children up to age five.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Early childhood mental health|url=http://www.zerotothree.org/child-development/early-childhood-mental-health/dc-0-3-revisions.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121013184721/http://www.zerotothree.org/child-development/early-childhood-mental-health/dc-0-3-revisions.html|archivedate=2012-10-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
The [[etiology]] of child psychopathology has many explanations which differ from case to case. Many [[psychopathological]] disorders in children involve genetic and physiological mechanisms, though there are still many without any physical grounds.  It is absolutely imperative that multiple sources of data be gathered. ''Diagnosing the psychopathology of children is daunting. It is influenced by development and contest, in addition to the traditional sources. Interviews with parents about school, etc., are inadequate. Either reports from teachers or direct observation by the professional are critical.'' (author, Robert B. Bloom, Ph.D.) The disorders with physical or biological mechanisms are easier to diagnose in children and are often diagnosed earlier in childhood. However, there are some disorders, no matter the mechanisms, that are not identified until adulthood.  There is also reason to believe that there is co-morbidity of disorders, in that if one disorder is present, there is often another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 20837980 | doi=10.1177/1087054710380188 | volume=16 | title=Relationships between learning disability, executive function, and psychopathology in children with ADHD | author=Mattison RE, Mayes SD | journal=J Atten Disord | pages=138–46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Stress ==
Emotional stress or [[Psychological trauma|trauma]] in the parent-child relationship tends to be a cause of child psychopathology. First seen in infants, separation anxiety in root of parental-child stress may lay the foundations for future disorders in children. There is a direct correlation between maternal stress and child stress that is factored in both throughout adolescences development.&lt;ref name="Schimizzi"&gt;.{{cite web |author= Schimizzi A  | title= Maternal Depression and child psychopathology: a two way street |work= child-psych.com |date = August 2011| url= http://www.child-psych.org/2011/08/maternal-depression-and-child-psychopathology-a-two-way-street.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a situation where the mother is absent, any primary caregiver to the child could be seen as the "maternal" relationship. Essentially, the child would bond with the primary caregiver, exuding some personality traits of the caregiver.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

In studies of child in two age groups of pregnancy to five years, and fifteen years and twenty years, Raposa and colleagues (2011) studied the impact of psychopathology in the child-maternal relationship and how not only the mothers stress affected the child, but the child's stress affected the mother. Historically, it was believed that mothers who suffered from [[post partum depression]] might be the reason their child suffers from mental disorders both earlier and later in development. However this correlation was found to not only reflect maternal [[mood disorder|depression]] on child psychopathology, but also child psychopathology could reflect on maternal depression.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

Children with a predisposition to psychopathology may cause higher stress in the relationship with their mother, and mothers who suffer from psychopathology may also cause higher stress in the relationship with their child.  Child psychopathology creates stress in parenting which may increase the severity of the psychopathology within the child.&lt;ref name="Raposa2011"&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1007/s10802-011-9536-0 |vauthors=Raposa E, Hammen C, Brennan P | title= Effects of Child Psychopathology on Maternal Depression: The Mediating Role of Child-Related Acute and Chronic Stessors  |url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3378678/pdf/nihms382334.pdf |journal= Journal of Abnormal Child Psychology | volume=39 |issue=8 |pages=1177–1186 |year=2011 | pmid=21735051 | pmc=3378678}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Together, these factors push and pull the relationship thus causing higher levels of depression, ADHD, defiant disorder, learning disabilities, and pervasive developmental disorder in both the mother and the child. The outline and summary of this study is found below:
""In looking at child-related stress, the number of past child mental health diagnoses significantly predicted a higher number of acute stressors for mothers as well as more chronic stress in the mother-child relationship at age 15.  These increased levels of maternal stress and mother-child relationship stress at age 15 then predicted higher levels of maternal depression when the youth were 20 years old.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

Looking more closely at the data, the authors found that it was the chronic stress in the mother-child relationship and the child-related acute stressors that were the linchpins between child psychopathology and maternal depression.  The stress is what fueled the fires between mother and child mental health.  Going one step further, the researchers found that youth with a history of more than one diagnosis as well as youth that had externalizing disorders (e.g., conduct disorder) had the highest number of child-related stressors and the highest levels of mother-child stress.  Again, all of the findings held up when other potentially stressful variables, such as economic worries and past maternal depression, were controlled for.&lt;ref name="Raposa2011" /&gt;

Additionally, siblings- both older and younger and of both genders, can be factored into the etiology and development of child psychopathology. In a [[longitudinal study]] of maternal depression and older male child depression and antisocial behaviors on younger siblings adolescent mental health outcome. The study factored in ineffective parenting and sibling conflicts such as [[sibling rivalry]]. Younger female siblings were more directly affected by maternal depression and older brother depression and anti social behaviors when the indirect effects were not place, in comparison to younger male siblings who showed no such comparison. However, if an older brother were anti-social, the younger child- female or male would exude higher anti-social behaviors. In the presence of a sibling conflict, anti social behavior was more influential on younger male children than younger female children. Female children were more sensitive to pathological familial environments, thus showing that in a high- stress environment with both maternal depression and older- male sibling depression and anti social behavior, there is a higher risk of female children developing psychopathological disorders.&lt;ref name="Compton2000"&gt;.{{cite journal |author= Compton KL | title= A double jeopardy model of risk: The additive effects of maternal depression and sibling psychopathology in negative child outcome by gender. |journal= Dissertation Abstracts International| volume=61 |issue=6-B |pages=3272 |year=2000| url= https://books.google.ca/books/about/A_Double_Jeopardy_Model_of_Risk.html?id=icxNOAAACAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was a small study, and more research needs to be done especially with older female children, paternal relationships, maternal-paternal-child stress relationships, and/or caregiver-child stress relationships if the child is orphaned or not being raised by the biological child to reach a conclusive child-parent stress model on the effects of familial and environmental pathology on the child's development.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

== Temperament ==
The child-parent stress and development is only one hypothesis for the etiology of child psychopathology. Other experts believe that child [[temperament]] is a large factor in the development of child psychopathology.  High susceptibility to child psychopathology is marked by low levels of [[Temperament#Effortful Control|effortful control]] and high levels of emotionality and [[neuroticism]]. Parental [[divorce]] is often a large factor in childhood depression and other psychopathological disorders.&lt;ref name="Muris2005"&gt;.{{cite journal | doi=10.1007/s10567-005-8809-y |vauthors=Muris P, Ollendick TH | title= The role of temperament in the etiology of child psychopathology |journal=Clinical Child and Family Psychology Review | volume=8 |issue=4 |pages=271–289 |year=2005 | pmid=16362256}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is more so when the divorce involves a long-drawn separation and one parent bad-mouthing the other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rose|first1=Katherine|title=How to Deal With Your Partner’s Cheating?|url=https://medium.com/@imkatherine23/how-to-deal-with-your-partners-cheating-2ef809c4df1e|accessdate=12 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; That is not to say that divorce will lead to psychopathological disorders, there are also other factors such as temperament, trauma, and other negative life events (e.g. death, sudden moving of home, physical or sexual abuse), genetics, environment, and nurture that correlate to the onset of a disorder. Research has also shown that child maltreatment may increase risk for various forms of psychopathology as it increases threat sensitivity, decreases responsivity to reward, and causes deficits in emotion recognition and understanding.&lt;ref&gt;Jaffee SR. Child maltreatment and risk for psychopathology in childhood and adulthood. Annual Review Clinical Psycholology, 2017 May 8;13:525-551. doi: 10.1146/annurev-clinpsy-032816-045005&lt;/ref&gt;

Found in "The Role of Temperament in the Etiology of Child Psychopathology", a model for the etiology of child psychopathology by Vasey and Dadds (2001) proposed that the four things that are important to the development of psychopathological disorders is: 1) biological factors: hormones, genetics, neurotransmitters 2) psychological: self-esteem, coping skills, cognitive issues 3) social factors: family rearing, negative learning experiences, and stress 4) child's temperament. Using an array of neurological scans and exams, [[psychological evaluation]]s, family medical history, and observing the child in daily factors can help the physician find the etiology of the psychopathological disorder to help release the child of the symptoms through therapy, medication use, social skills training, and life style changes.&lt;ref name="Muris2005"/&gt;

Child psychopathology can cause separation anxiety from parents, attention deficit disorders in children, sleep disorders in children, aggression with both peers and adults, night terrors, extreme anxiety, anti social behavior, depression symptoms, aloof attitude, sensitive emotions, and rebellious behavior that are not in line of typical childhood development. Aggression is found to manifest in children before five years of age, and early stress and aggression in the parental-child relationship correlates with the manifestation of aggression. Aggression in children causes problematic peer relationships, difficulty adjusting, and coping problems. Children who fail to overcome acceptable ways of coping and emotion expression are put on tract for psychopathological disorders and violent and anti social behaviors into adolescence and adulthood. There is a higher rate of [[substance abuse]] in these children with coping and aggression issues, and causes a cycle of emotional instability and manifestation psychopathological disorders.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

== Neurology and etiology ==
[[Borderline personality disorder]] (BPD) is one of many psychopathology disorders a child can suffer from. In the neurobiological scheme, borderline personality disorder may have effects on the left [[amygdala]]. In a 2003 study of BPD patients versus control patients, when faced with expressions that were happy, sad, or fearful BPD patients showed significantly more activation versus control patients. In neutral faces, BPD patients attributed negative qualities to these faces.&lt;ref name="Knowlton2005"&gt;.{{cite journal |author=Knowlton L | title= Nature Versus Nurture: How Is Child Psychopathology Developed? |journal=Psychiatric Times | volume=22 |issue=8 |pages=184–201 |date=July 2005| url= http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/child-adolescent-psych/content/article/10168/52541?pageNumber=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
As stated by Gabbard, an experimenter in this study:
"A hyperactive amygdala may be involved in the predisposition to be hyper vigilant and over reactive to relatively benign emotional expressions. Misreading neutral faces is clearly related to transference misreadings that occur in psychotherapy and the creation of bad object experiences linked with projective identification."&lt;ref name="Knowlton2005"/&gt;

Also linked to BPD, is the presence of [[serotonin transporter]] (5-HTT) in a short allele demonstrated larger amygdala neuronal activity when presented with fearful stimuli as in comparison to individuals with a long allele of 5-HTT.  As found in the [[Dunedin Longitudinal Study]] a short allele of 5-HTT predisposes the person to have hyperactivity in the amygdala in response to trauma, and thus moderated the impact of stressful life events leading to a higher risk of depression and suicidal idealities. These same qualities were not observed in individuals with long alleles of 5-HTT. However, the environment the child is in can change in impact of this gene, proving that correct treatment, intensive social support, and a healthy and nurturing environment can modify genetic vulnerability.&lt;ref name="Knowlton2005"/&gt;

Possibly the most studied or documented of the child psychopathologies is [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]] (ADHD) which is marked with learning disabilities, mood disorders, and/or aggression. Though believed to be over diagnosed, ADHD is highly comorbid for other disorders such as depression and [[obsessive compulsive disorder]]. In studies of the prefrontal cortex in ADHD children, which is responsible for the regulation of behavior, cognition, and attention; and in the dopamine system there has been identified a hidden genetic polymorphisms. More specific, the 7-repeat allele of the dopamine D4 receptor gene, responsible for inhibited prefrontal cortex cognition and less efficient receptors, causes more externalized behaviors such as aggression since the child has trouble "thinking through" seemingly ordinary and at level childhood tasks.&lt;ref name="Nevels2010"&gt;.{{cite journal | doi=10.1037/a0018059  |vauthors=Nevels RM, Dehon EE, Alexander K, Gontkovsky ST | title= Psychopharmacology of aggression in children and adolescents with primary neuropsychiatric disorders: A review of current and potentially promising treatment options |journal=[[Experimental and Clinical Psychopharmacology]] | volume=18 |issue=2 |pages=184–201 |year=2010 | pmid=20384430}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Agenesis of the corpus callosum and etiology==
[[Agenesis of the corpus callosum]] (ACC) is used to determine the frequency of social and behavioral problems in children with a prevalence rate of about 2-3%. ACC is described as a defect in the brain where the 200 million axons that make the corpus collosum are either completely absent, or partially gone. In many cases, the anterior commissure is still present to allow for the passing of information from one cerebral hemisphere to the other. The children are of normal intelligence level. For younger children, ages two to five, Agenesis of the corpus callosum causes problems in sleep. Sleep is critical for development in children, and lack of sleep can set the grounds for a manifestation of psychopathological disorders.&lt;ref name="Coulombe2010"&gt;.{{cite journal | doi=10.1093/jpepsy/jsp097  |vauthors=Coulombe J, Reid GJ, Boyle MH, Racine Y | title= Concurrent associations among sleep problems, indicators of inadequate sleep, psychopathology, and shared risk factors in a population-based sample of healthy Ontario children |journal=Journal of Pediatric Psychology | volume=35 |issue=7 |pages=790–799 |year=2010 | pmid=19923203}}&lt;/ref&gt; In children ages six to eleven, ACC showed manifestation in problems with social function, thought, attention, and somatic grievances.  In comparison, of children with autism, children with ACC showed less impairment on almost all scales such as anxiety and depression, attention, abnormal thoughts, and social function versus autistic children.  However, a small percentage of children with ACC showed traits that may lead to the diagnosis of autism in the areas of social communications and social interactions but do not show the same symptoms of autism in the repetitive and restricted behaviors category.&lt;ref name="Badaruddin2007"&gt;.{{cite journal | doi=10.1007/s10578-007-0065-6 |vauthors=Badaruddin DH, Andrews GL, Bölte S, Schilmoeller KJ, Schilmoeller G, Paul LK, Brown WS | title= Social and behavioral problems of children with agenesis of the corpus callosum  |journal=Child Psychiatry and Human Development | volume=38 |issue=4 |pages=287–302 |year=2007 | url= http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=psyh&amp;AN=2008-00117-004&amp;site=ehost-live }}&lt;/ref&gt; The difficulties from ACC may lead to the etiology of child psychopathological disorders, such as depression or ADHD and manifest many autistic-like disorders that can cause future psychological disorders in later adolescence.
The etiology of child psychopathology is a multi-factor path. A slew of factors must be taken into account before diagnosis of a disorder.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

The child's genetics, environment, temperament, past medical history, family medical history, prevalence of symptoms and neuro-anatomical structures are all factors that should be considered when diagnosing a child with a psychopathological disorder.&lt;ref name="Badaruddin2007"/&gt; Thousands of children each year are misdiagnosed and put on the wrong treatment, which may result in the manifestation of other disorders the child would have not have gotten else wise. There are hundreds of causes of psychopathological disorders, and each one manifests at different ages and stages in child development and can come out due to trauma and stress. Some disorders may "disappear" and reappear in the presence of a trauma, depression, or stress similar to the one that brought the disorder out in the child in the beginning.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

==Treatment==
It is estimated that 5% of children under the age of eight suffer from a psychopathology disorder. Girls more frequently manifested disorders than boys in similar situations. By age sixteen about thirty percent of children will have fit the criteria for at least one psychopathology disorder. Only a small number of these children receive treatment for their disorder. Anxiety and depression disorders in children- whether noted or unnoted, are found to be a precursor for similar episodes in adulthood. Usually a large stressor similar to the one the person experienced in childhood brings out the anxiety or depression in adulthood.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

Multifinality refers to the idea that two children can react to same stressful event quite differently, and may display divergent types of problem behavior. Psychopathological disorders are extremely situational- having to take into account the child, the genetics, the environment, the stressor, and many other factors to tailor the best type of treatment to relieve the child of the psychopathology symptoms.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

Many child psychopathology disorders are treated with control medications prescribed by a pediatrician or psychiatrist.  After extensive evaluation of the child through school visits, by psychologists and physicians, a medication can be prescribed.  A patient may need to go through several trials of medicines to find the best fit, as many cause uncomfortable and undesired side effects- such as dry mouth or suicidal thoughts can occur. There are many classes of drugs a physician can choose from and they are: [[psychostimulants]], [[beta blockers]]s, [[atypical antipsychotic]]s, [[lithium]], [[alpha-2 agonist]]s, [[antipsychotic|traditional antipsychotics]], [[SSRI]]s, and [[anticonvulsant mood- stabilizers]]. Given the multifinality of psychopathological disorders, two children may be on the same medication for two completely different disorders, or have the same disorder and be taking two completely different medications.

ADHD is the most successfully treated disorder of child psychopathology, and the medications used have a high- abuse rate especially among college-aged students. Psycho stimulants such as [[Ritalin]], amphetamine- related stimulant drugs: e.g., [[Adderall]], and antidepressants such as [[Wellbutrin]] have been successfully used to treat ADHD with a 78% success rate. Many of these drug treatment options are paired with behavioral treatment such as therapy or social skills lessons.

[[Lithium]] has shown to be extremely effective in treating ADHD and bipolar disorder. Lithium treats both mania and depression and helps prevent relapse.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Blader|first=Joseph C.|last2=Kafantaris|first2=Vivian|date=March 2007|title=Pharmacological Treatment of Bipolar Disorder among Children and Adolescents|journal=Expert review of neurotherapeutics|volume=7|issue=3|pages=259–270|doi=10.1586/14737175.7.3.259|issn=1473-7175|pmc=2946413|pmid=17341174}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mechanism of lithium include the inhibition of GSK-3, it is a glutamate antagonism at NMDA receptors that together make lithium a [[neuroprotective]] medicine. The drug relieves bipolar symptoms, aggressiveness and irritability. Lithium has many, many side effects and requires weekly blood tests to tests for toxicity of the drug. {{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

Medications that act on cell membrane ion channels, are GABA inhibitory neurotransmission, and also inhibit excitatory glutamate transmission have shown to be extremely effective in treating an array of child psychopathological disorders. Pharmaceutical companies are in the process of creating new drugs and improving those on the market to help avoid negative and possibly life altering short term and long term side effects, making drugs more safe to use in younger children and over long periods of time during adolescent development.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

==Future of Child Psychopathology==

The future of child psychopathology- etiology and treatment has a two-way path. While many professionals agree that many children who suffer from a disorder do not receive proper treatment, at the rate of 5-15% that receive treatment leaving many children in the dark.  In the same boat are the physicians who also say that not only do more of these disorders need to be recognized in children and treated properly, but also even those children who show some qualifying symptoms of a disorder but not to the degree of diagnosis should also receive treatment and therapy to avoid the manifestation of the disorder. By treating children even with slight degrees of a psychopathological disorder, children can show improvements in their relationships with peers, family, and teachers and also improvements in school, mental health, and personal development.&lt;ref name="Leadbeater2010"&gt;.{{cite journal | doi=10.1037/a0020486 |author= Leadbeater B  | title= The fickle fates of push and pull in the dissemination of mental health programs for children |journal=Canadian Psychology | volume=51 |issue=4 |pages=221–230 |year=2010 | url= http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/cap/51/4/221/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many physicians believe the best prevention and help starts in the home and the school of the child, before physicians and psychologists are contacted.

So while there is more awareness of child psychopathological disorders and more research to prevent and effectively treat these disorders to maintain healthy emotional health in children, there is also a negative factor in that parents, schools, and psychologists may be more sensitive and therefore over-diagnose children with these disorders. Mental health professionals and pharmaceutical marketing companies need to be cautious of making disorders too readily diagnosed and treated with medications.

Child psychopathology is a real thing that thousands of children suffer from. While hundreds of children are diagnosed with a new disorder daily, researchers are developing new strategies to beat these disorders in children to allow all children the right to a happy and healthy childhood.  With further education on the symptoms and implications of child psychopathology, psychologists and physicians will improve their accuracy in diagnosing children- giving the right diagnosis and discovering the most helpful treatment and therapies for children.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

== Theory and Research ==
The current trend in the U.S. is to understand child psychopathology from a systems based perspective called [[developmental psychopathology]]. Recent emphasis has also been on understanding psychological disorders from a relational perspective with attention also given to [[neurobiology]].  Practitioners who follow [[attachment theory]] believe that early attachment experiences of children can promote adaptive strategies or lay the groundwork for maladaptive ways of coping which can later lead to mental health disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Perry|first=Bruce|title=The Boy who was raised as a dog|isbn=0-465-05652-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Karr-Morse|title=Ghosts from the Nursery|isbn=0-87113-734-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research and clinical work on child psychopathology tends to fall under several main areas: [[etiology]], [[epidemiology]], diagnosis, [[psychological testing|assessment]], and treatment.

Parents are considered a reliable source of information because they spend more time with children than any other adult. A child's psychopathology can be connected to parental behaviors. Clinicians and researchers have experienced problems with children's self-reports and rely on adults to provide the information.&lt;ref&gt;Nolen-Hoeksema, S. (2013). (Ab)normal Psychology (6th
edition). McGraw Hill.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[microbiology]], '''coinfection''' {{IPAc-en|ˌ|k|oʊ|ɪ|n|ˈ|f|ɛ|k|ʃ|ən}} is the simultaneous [[infection]] of a [[host (biology)|host]] by multiple [[pathogens|pathogen]] [[species]]. In [[virology]], coinfection includes simultaneous infection of a single [[cell (biology)|cell]] by two or more [[virus]] particles. An example is the coinfection of [[liver]] cells with [[hepatitis B virus]] and [[hepatitis D virus]], which can arise incrementally by initial infection followed by [[superinfection]].

Global [[prevalence]] or [[incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] of coinfection among humans is unknown, but it is thought to be commonplace,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cox |first1=FE |title=Concomitant infections, parasites and immune responses |series=122 |journal=Parasitology |volume=Suppl |pages=S23–38 |year=2001 |pmid=11442193 | doi = 10.1017/s003118200001698x }}&lt;/ref&gt; sometimes more common than single infection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0020-7519(97)00189-6 |last1=Petney |first1=TN |last2=Andrews |first2=RH |title=Multiparasite communities in animals and humans: frequency, structure and pathogenic significance |journal=International Journal for Parasitology |volume=28 |issue=3 |pages=377–93 |year=1998 |pmid=9559357}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Coinfection with [[helminths]] affects around 800 million people worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/3285768 |last1=Crompton |first1=DW |title=How much human helminthiasis is there in the world? |journal=The Journal of Parasitology |volume=85 |issue=3 |pages=397–403 |year=1999 |pmid=10386428 |jstor=3285768}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coinfection is of particular human health importance because pathogen species can [[Biological interaction|interact]] within the host. The net effect of coinfection on human health is thought to be negative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jinf.2011.06.005 |last1=Griffiths |first1=EC |last2=Pedersen |first2=ABP |last3=Fenton |first3=A |last4=Petchey |first4=OP |title=The nature and consequences of coinfection in humans |journal=[[Journal of Infection]] |volume=63 |issue=3 |pages=200–206 |year=2011 |pmid= 21704071 |pmc=3430964}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interactions can have either [[Ecological facilitation|positive]] or negative effects on other parasites. Under positive parasite interactions, disease [[transmission (medicine)|transmission]] and progression are enhanced and this is also known as [[syndemic|syndemism]]. Negative parasite interactions include microbial interference when one bacterial species suppresses the [[virulence]] or [[colonisation (biology)|colonisation]] of other bacteria, such as ''[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]'' suppressing pathogenic ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'' [[colony]] formation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hoffman |first1=L.

The '''European Association for Psychotherapy (EAP)''' is a [[Vienna]]-based umbrella organisation for 128 psychotherapist organizations (including 28 national associations and 17 European associations) from 41 countries with a membership of more than 120,000 psychotherapists.  Individual members may also join the organisation directly rather than through one of its member organisations.

The EAP has auspiced much of the European effort from the mid-1990s toward the professionalisation of psychotherapy and the formation of pan-European training standards, ethics and guidelines.&lt;ref&gt;Young, C. (2011) The history and development of Body Psychotherapy: European collaboration, ''Body, Movement and Dance in Psychotherapy: An International Journal for Theory, Research and Practice'', 6:1, DOI: 10.1080/17432979.2010.545189 p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt;

Its President is currently Philippe Vrancken (Belgium), the General Secretary of the EAP is Prof. Eugenijus Laurinaitis (Lithuania).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.europsyche.org/executive_board|title=EAP: Executive Board|last=EAP|website=www.europsyche.org|access-date=2017-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The association is based on the ''Strasbourg Declaration on Psychotherapy'' of 1990 whereby the EAP promotes the need for high standards of training on a scientific basis, and fights for free and independent exercise of psychotherapy in Europe.  Important activities include:

* Creating a collaborative democratic forum for all European national and method-based professional associations in psychotherapy.
* Establishing pan-European professional post-graduate training standards consisting of a minimum of 2,400 hours, over a minimum of 4 years, of specialist training, with a significant component of supervised practice.
* Awarding the European Certificate of Psychotherapy (ECP): The aim of the European Certificate of Psychotherapy is to implement a comparable standard of training and mutual recognition of training across Europe. 
* Building the Register for ECP Psychotherapists: creating a searchable database of the availability of over 5,000 psychotherapists in Europe 
* Promoting EAP Ethical Guidelines: The EAP has developed ethical guidelines to protect patients and is establishing these across Europe 
* EAP is also a founding member of the [[World Council for Psychotherapy]] (WCP)

'''''FDA v. [[Brown &amp; Williamson|Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corp.]]''''', 529 U.S. 120 (2000), is an important [[United States Supreme Court]] case in the development of [[American administrative law]]. It ruled that the [[Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act]] did not give the [[Food and Drug Administration|Food and Drug Administration (FDA)]] the authority to regulate tobacco products as "drugs" or "devices".

==Legal principle==
The scope of authority held by an agency is determined by the agency's [[organic statute (USA)|organic statute]].  Where Congress repeatedly denies an agency the power to regulate a particular area, and develops a comprehensive regulatory scheme outside the control of the agency, the agency may not regulate that area.

Note: The approach in this case balances the approach of ''[[US v. Southwestern Cable Co.]]''.  Whereas ''Southwestern Cable'' allowed an agency to regulate areas not explicitly contemplated by the statute when necessary to fulfill its ultimate goal even when legislative efforts to gain such power failed, ''FDA'' does not allow agencies to regulate areas for which Congress has developed a separate statutory scheme.

==Facts and procedural posture==
The [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) attempted to regulate tobacco products.  Tobacco companies challenged the regulations.  The District Court granted in part and denied in part the plaintiff's claim.  The Circuit Court reversed, ruling for the tobacco company.

The Supreme Court ultimately affirmed the Circuit Court's ruling for the tobacco company, ruling that the FDA did not have the power to enact and enforce the regulations in question.

==Analysis==
The FDA's authority to regulate came from the [[Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act]] (FDCA).  The FDA argued that nicotine was a "drug" and cigarettes and smokeless tobacco are "devices" that deliver nicotine to the body  within the meaning of the FDCA.  Congress had enacted a number of tobacco-specific laws after the FDCA, and the FDA had never exercised any control over tobacco.  The Court concluded in light of this that Congress did not intend to give the FDA the power to regulate tobacco, and that the regulations were therefore invalid.

==Further developments==
This decision was overridden by the passage of the [[Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act]] of 2009, which gave the FDA the authority to regulate the tobacco industry and control the level of nicotine in cigarettes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Randomized Trial of Reduced-Nicotine Standards for Cigarettes |journal=New England Journal of Medicine |volume=373 |issue=14 |pages=1340–9 |doi= 10.1056/NEJMsa1502403|pmid=26422724 |year=2015 |last1=Donny |first1=Eric C. |last2=Denlinger |first2=Rachel L. |last3=Tidey |first3=Jennifer W. |last4=Koopmeiners |first4=Joseph S. |last5=Benowitz |first5=Neal L. |last6=Vandrey |first6=Ryan G. |last7=Al'Absi |first7=Mustafa |last8=Carmella |first8=Steven G. |last9=Cinciripini |first9=Paul M. |last10=Dermody |first10=Sarah S. |last11=Drobes |first11=David J. |last12=Hecht |first12=Stephen S. |last13=Jensen |first13=Joni |last14=Lane |first14=Tonya |last15=Le |first15=Chap T. |last16=McClernon |first16=F.

'''Farm-to-table''' (or '''farm-to-fork''', and in some cases '''farm-to-school''') is a [[social movement]] which promotes serving [[local food]] at restaurants and school cafeterias, preferably through direct acquisition from the producer (which might be a winery, brewery, ranch, fishery, or other type of food producer which is not strictly a "farm").  This might be accomplished by a direct sales relationship, a [[community-supported agriculture]] arrangement, a [[farmer's market]], a local distributor or by the restaurant or school raising its own food.  Farm-to-table often incorporates a form of [[food traceability]] (celebrated as "knowing where your food comes from") where the origin of the food is identified to consumers.  Often restaurants cannot source all the food they need for dishes locally, so only some dishes or only some ingredients are labelled as local.

The farm-to-table movement has arisen more or less concurrently with changes in attitudes about [[food safety]], food freshness, food seasonality, and [[Small farm|small-farm]] economics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brain|first1=Roslynn|title=The Local Food Movement: Definitions, Benefits &amp; Resources|url=http://digitalcommons.usu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2693&amp;context=extension_curall|website=Utah State University|publisher=Utah State University|accessdate=15 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Advocates and practitioners of the farm-to-table model frequently cite the scarcity of fresh, local ingredients; the poor flavor of ingredients shipped from afar; the poor nutritional integrity of shipped ingredients; the disappearance of small [[family farms]]; the disappearance of [[Heirloom plant|heirloom]] and [[Open pollination|open-pollinated]] fruits and vegetables; and the dangers of a highly centralized food growing and distribution system as motivators for their decision to adopted a more locavore approach to the food system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gogoi|first1=Pallavi|title=The Local Food Movement Benefits Farms, Food Production, Environment|url=http://researchseniors.wikispaces.com/file/view/Local+food.pdf|website=Business Week Online|publisher=Business Week Online|accessdate=15 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="menusofchange"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.menusofchange.org/images/uploads/pdf/CIA-Harvard_MenusOfChangeAnnualReport2016_(7-1)1.pdf|title=Menus of Change: The Business of Healthy, Sustainable, Delicious Food Choices|last=Harvard University|first=[[Culinary Institute of America]]|date=2016|website=Menus of Change|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;'''

==Influences and growth==
Among the first vocal and influential farm-to-table businesses were: [[Chez Panisse]] restaurant in [[Berkeley, California]], [[The Herbfarm]] in [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]], [[Bon Appétit Management Company]] based in [[Palo Alto, California]], and The Kitchen in Boulder, Colorado. Since the 2000s, the number of farm-to-table operations has grown rapidly and "the American Farm to Table Restaurant Guide lists restaurants located in more than 30 states and the District of Columbia".&lt;ref name="menusofchange"/&gt; In 2015, according to the National Restaurant Association "four of the top ten trends" related to local foods.&lt;ref name="menusofchange"/&gt;

Prominent advocates for the farm-to-table movement, either as chefs, writers, farmers, or environmentalists include: [[Wendell Berry]], [[Wes Jackson]], [[Michael Pollan]], [[Thomas Keller]], [[John Jeavons]], [[Alice Waters]], [[Dan Barber]], [[Joel Salatin]], [[Barbara Kingsolver]], [[Tony Maws]], [[Kevin Gillespie (chef)|Kevin Gillespie,]] [[Edna Lewis]], [[Ken Myszka]], [[Erik Manning]] and others.

==Fraud==

Investigations by journalists at the ''[[Tampa Bay Times]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Farm to Fable: A Times investigation into Tampa Bay's local food scene| url=http://www.tampabay.com/news/farm-to-fable-a-times-investigation-into-tampa-bays-local-food-scene/2273052| date=15 April 2016| work=Tampa Bay Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[San Diego Magazine]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Farm to Fable: Deception, fraud, and honest mistakes in the farm-to-table movement| url=http://www.sandiegomagazine.com/San-Diego-Magazine/July-2015/Farm-to-Fable/| date=24 June 2015| author=Troy Johnson| work=San Diego Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; found widespread fraud in the claims made by area farm-to-table restaurants about where the food they were serving came from.  Cases included: restaurant previously bought from that provider but has since switched without updating the menu; restaurant claims to buy from a farmer, but the farmer denies ever having sold to that restaurant; restaurant serving a type of food the cited farmer or fisher has never grown or caught or which is currently out of season or not being provided; restaurant claiming to serve food from a provider which has gone out of business years ago; food from the claimed source makes up only a small portion of the type of food on the plate.  In cases where fraudulent claims are being made, the food actually being served is usually non-local or even "commodity" food which is cheaper or more available out-of-season.  In some cases food claimed to be "wild caught", "preservative-free", "made in-house", "Fresh from Florida", or "Long Island duck" was not.  Such practices open restaurants to lawsuits from the farmer whose name is being used fraudulently, lawsuits from consumers who have purchased mislabelled food products, and enforcement actions by government agencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://lizerbramlaw.com/2015/07/07/farm-to-table-fraud-the-legal-side/ | title = Farm-to-Table Fraud: The Legal Side | publisher = David Lizerbram &amp; Associates Blog | date = July 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Tampa Bay Times'' food critic and investigative reporter Laura Reiley attributes fraud in part to the rise of the farm-to-table trend since 2012, the lack of time of restaurants to deal directly with farms whereas they normally would deal with one or two large distributors, and in some cases sheer [[profit motive]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url = http://www.tampabay.com/projects/2016/food/farm-to-fable/restaurants/ | title = At Tampa Bay farm-to-table restaurants, you’re being fed fiction | publisher = ''Tampa Bay Times'' | author = Laura Reiley | date = April 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fast-casual meets farm-to-table ==
More recently restaurateurs have tried to democratize the farm-to-table movement by opening fast-casual restaurants that offer locally sourced food at a relatively affordable price point. [[Sweetgreen]], a farm-to-table salad chain has experienced exponential growth since opening in 2007 in Washington D.C, and now has more than 60 locations across the United States.&lt;ref name="menusofchange"/&gt; The salad bar chain, started on the premise of sourcing food as locally as possible. The chain "works with more than 500 farmers" to limit the distance food travels across all their locations, requiring each region to build relationships with their local farm community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hedgecock|first1=Sarah|title=How Creating 'Intimacy At Scale' Drives Sweetgreen's Fast-Casual Success|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/sarahhedgecock/2016/10/18/how-customers-drive-sweetgreens-success/#a2d5ef03e0e4|accessdate=15 April 2017|agency=Forbes|publisher=Forbes|date=October 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In New York, another fast casual concept, Dig Inn, has gained popularity with their "farm-to-counter" model.&lt;ref name=diginn&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/dig-inn-is-hiring-farmers-and-building-its-own-farm-2016-8|title=This fast-casual chain New Yorkers love just took sustainable food to the next level|last=Garfield|first=Leanna|date=August 22, 2016|work=Business Insider|access-date=April 15, 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, [[Dig Inn]] announced they intend to buy and manage their own farm. While they don't plan to source all their food from their farm, it will be a place for education and to learn "exactly how things grow".&lt;ref name=diginn/&gt; Both of these restaurant concepts have received noteworthy funding, as investors gain more interest in food startups, particularly those connecting to the local food system.&lt;ref name="menusofchange"/&gt; Consumer interest is high enough that [[Applebee's]] has even explored the farm-to-table concept. Over the summer of 2014, the chain released a location-specific menu option: the Grilled Vidalia Onion Sirloin, in Georgia. It took six months to plan and was only available for a limited period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mintel GNPD|title=Innovation on the Menu: Flavor Trends - US - June 2014|url=http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2211/display/706773/?highlight|website=Mintel|publisher=Mintel|accessdate=15 April 2017|date=June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
Despite the growth in the farm-to-table restaurants the movement has been met with some criticism. Critics argue the interest in knowing where your food comes from and ensuring it is locality sourced is just another food fad for millennials.&lt;ref name=bostonglobe&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/opinion/2015/08/22/farm-table-just-fad/SruWUMLL6tfrJ0WOrtNTGK/story.html|title=Is farm-to-table just a fad?|last=Gunst|first=Kathy|date=August 22, 2015|website=Boston Globe|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the higher price point that many restaurants are forced to demand, given the higher costs of production and lower economies of scale, also make farm-to-table food less accessible for many people.&lt;ref name=bostonglobe/&gt; The movement was originally closed tied to "tree-hugging elitists," who were able to afford farm-to-table food.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/220357|title=How the Farm-to-Table Movement Is Helping Grow the Economy|last=Schoenfeld|first=Bruce|date=September 21, 2011|website=Entrepreneur|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lastly, critics argue that the farm-to-table term is not fully understood by consumers. For example, foods advertised as farm-to-table are considered healthier regardless of actual nutritional content.&lt;ref name="menusofchange"/&gt;

'''Farm assurance''' is [[product certification]] for [[Agriculture|agricultural]] products that emphasises the principles of [[quality assurance]].  The emphasis on quality assurance means that, in addition to product inspection, farm assurance schemes may include standards and certification for traceability, production methods, transport, and supplies.&lt;ref name="igd"&gt;{{Cite web

All farm assurance schemes claim to ensure high standards of animal welfare, although there is great variation in the requirements that relate to how animals should be kept and cared for.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ciwf.org.uk/media/5231246/standards_analysis_exec_summary.pdf |title=Farm Assurance Schemes &amp; Animal Welfare: How the standards compare. 2012.

In the United Kingdom and Australia, the major farm assurance programmes are based on a quality management system for food safety that originated with the US space agency NASA, known as [[Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points]] (HACCP).&lt;ref name="da"&gt;{{Cite web

Some farm assurance schemes are given legal force, either by use of trademarks or by oversight by government regulators of agriculture and food standards.
While mostly associated with food production, farm assurance can be applied to other agricultural products, such as [[textiles]], [[flowers]], [[tobacco]] and [[biofuels]].

In order to obtain farm product certification, assurance may be required for farm supplies.
For example, the UK's Red Tractor scheme is supported by assurance programmes for [[fodder]] (UFAS, FEMAS) and [[fertiliser]] (FIAS).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

==Other quality standards==

Other widely used agricultural quality standards are based entirely on product inspection, and do not rely on other aspects of quality assurance.
One example of such a programme is the United States Quality Standards for grading, certification and verification: the [[Beef#USDA beef grades|USDA beef grades]] depend on physical attributes of the meat, plus the age of the animal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

'''''Fetus in fetu''''' (or '''''foetus in foetu''''') is a [[developmental abnormality]] in which a mass of tissue resembling a [[fetus]] forms inside the body. An early example of the phenomenon was described in 1808 by George William Young.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2128792/pdf/medcht00073-0262.pdf |title=Case of A Foetus found in the Abdomen of a Boy |author=George William Young |date=1808 |accessdate=2012-11-22 |pmc=2128792 |pmid=20895115 |volume=1 |journal=Med Chir Trans |pages=236–64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two theories of origin concerning "fetus in fetu". One theory is that the mass begins as a normal fetus but becomes enveloped inside its [[twin]].&lt;ref name="Chua"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chua |first=JHY |authorlink= |author2=Chui CH |author3=Sai Prasad TR |title=Fetus-in-fetu in the pelvis |journal=Annals of the Academy of Medicine Singapore |volume=34 |issue= |pages=646–9 |publisher= |year=2005 |url=http://annals.edu.sg/pdf/34VolNo10200511/V34N10p646.pdf |format=PDF |doi= |id= |accessdate= |display-authors=etal |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011012449/http://annals.edu.sg/pdf/34VolNo10200511/V34N10p646.pdf |archivedate=2007-10-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The other theory is that the mass is a highly developed [[teratoma]]. "Fetus in fetu" is estimated to occur in 1 in 500,000 live births.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Grant P, Pearn JH |title=Foetus-in-foetu |journal=Med. J. Aust. |volume=1 |issue=20 |pages=1016–9 |date=May 1969 |pmid=5815070 |doi= |url=}}&lt;!-- someone needs to read this paper for evidence supporting what happento vero ayerthe claimed incidence --&gt; — source not consulted;  cited here following {{cite journal  |vauthors=Hoeffel CC, Nguyen KQ, Phan HT, etal |title=Fetus in fetu: a case report and literature review |journal=Pediatrics |volume=105 |issue=6 |pages=1335–44 |date=June 2000 |pmid=10835078 |doi= 10.1542/peds.105.6.1335|url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/105/6/1335 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Classification as life ==
A ''fetus in fetu'' can be considered alive, but only in the sense that its component tissues have not yet died or been eliminated.  Thus, the life of a ''fetus in fetu'' is akin to that of a [[tumor]] in that its cells remain viable by way of normal metabolic activity.  However, without the gestational conditions ''in [[uterus|utero]]'' with the [[amnion]] and [[placenta]], a ''fetus in fetu'' can develop into, at best, an especially well [[differentiated teratoma]]; or, at worst, a high-grade [[metastatic]] [[teratocarcinoma]]. In terms of physical maturation, its organs have a working blood supply from the host, but all cases of ''fetus in fetu'' present critical defects, such as no functional brain, heart, lungs, gastrointestinal tract, or urinary tract.  Accordingly, while a ''fetus in fetu'' can share select [[morphology (biology)|morphological]] features with a normal fetus, it has no prospect of any life outside of the host twin.  Moreover, it poses clear threats to the life of the host twin on whom its own life depends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jmedicalcasereports.com/content/2/1/2 |title=Journal of Medical Case Reports &amp;#124; Full text &amp;#124; Fetus in fetu : a case report |publisher=Jmedicalcasereports.com |accessdate=2012-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theories of development ==
There are two main theories about the development of fetus in fetu.

=== Teratoma theory ===
{{Main|Teratoma}}
Fetus in fetu may be a very highly differentiated form of [[dermoid cyst]], itself a highly differentiated form of [[teratoma|mature teratoma]].&lt;ref name="Basu"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Basu A, Jagdish S, Iyengar KR, Basu D |title=Fetus in fetu or differentiated teratomas? |journal=Indian J Pathol Microbiol |volume=49 |issue=4 |pages=563–5 |date=October 2006 |pmid=17183856 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Parasitic twin theory ===
{{Main|Parasitic twin}}
Fetus in fetu may be a [[parasitic twin]] [[fetus]] growing within its [[host (biology)|host]] [[twin]].  Very early in a [[monozygotic]] twin pregnancy, in which both fetuses share a common placenta, one fetus wraps around and envelops the other. The enveloped twin becomes a [[parasite]], in that its survival depends on the survival of the host twin, by drawing on the host twin's blood supply. The parasitic twin is [[anencephalic]] (without a [[Human brain|brain]]) and lacks some [[internal organ]]s, and as such is unable to survive on its own. As the host twin has to "feed" the enveloped twin from the nutrients received over a single umbilical cord, they usually die before birth.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}

== Usage and applications ==
Flame arresters are used:
* to stop the spread of an open fire
* to limit the spread of an explosive event that has occurred
* to protect potentially explosive mixtures from igniting
* to confine fire within an enclosed, controlled, or regulated location
* to stop the propagation of a flame traveling at sub-sonic velocities

They are commonly used on:
* fuel [[storage tank]] vents
* fuel gas [[Pipeline transport|pipelines]]
* safety storage cabinets for paint, [[aerosol can]]s, and other flammable mixtures
* the [[exhaust system]] of [[internal combustion engine]]s
* the air intake of marine inboard engines
* [[Davy lamp]]s in [[coal mining]]
* [[Rum#Grades|overproof rum]] and other flammable [[liquor]]s.&lt;ref name="HSE"/&gt;

==Principles==
A flame arrester (also called a deflagration arrester) functions by absorbing the heat from a flame front traveling at sub-sonic velocities, thus dropping the burning gas/air mixture below its auto-ignition temperature: consequently, the flame cannot survive. The heat is absorbed through channels (passages) designed into an element. These channels are chosen and measured as the mesg ([[Maximum Experimental Safe Gap]]) of the gas for a particular installation.
These passages can be regular, like crimped metal ribbon or [[wire]] [[mesh]] or a [[sheet metal]] plate with [[punch press|punched]] holes, or irregular, such as those in [[Raschig ring|random packing]].&lt;ref name="catox"/&gt;

The required size of the channels needed to stop the flame front can vary significantly, depending on the flammability of the fuel mixture. The large openings on a [[chain link fence]] are capable of slowing the spread of a small, slow-burning [[grass fire]], but fast-burning grass fires will penetrate the fence unless the holes are very small.&lt;ref&gt;''Do Wire Fences Stop Ground Fires?'', JAMES L. MURPHY AND HARRY E. SCHIMKE, U.S. Forest Service Research Note PSW-70, Pacific southwest forest and range experiment station, Berkeley, CA, 1965, http://www.fs.fed.us/psw/publications/documents/psw_rn070/psw_rn070.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In a [[coal mine]] containing highly explosive [[coal dust]] or [[methane]], the wire mesh of a [[Davy lamp]] must be very tightly spaced.

For flame arresters used as a safety device, the mesh must be protected from damage due to being dropped or struck by another object, and the mesh must be capable of rigidly retaining its shape during the propagation of a flame front. Any shifting of the individual wires that make up the mesh can create an opening large enough to allow the flame to penetrate and spread beyond the barrier.

On a fuel storage vent, flame arresters also serve a secondary purpose of allowing air pressure to equalize inside the tank when fuel is added or removed, while also preventing [[insects]] from flying or crawling into the vent piping and fouling the fuel in the tanks and pipes.

==Safety==
Flame arresters should be used only in the gas group and conditions they have been designed and tested for.  Since the depth on an arrester is specified for certain conditions, changes in the temperature, pressure, or composition of the gases entering the arrester can cause the flame spatial velocity to increase, making the design of the arrester insufficient to stop the flame front ("propagation"). The deflagration may continue downstream of the arrester.&lt;ref name="catox"/&gt;

Flame arresters should be periodically inspected to make sure they are free of [[dirt]], [[insect]]s using it as a [[nest]], or [[corrosion]].  The [[U.S. Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board]] concluded that an uninspected and badly corroded flame arrester failed to prevent a 2006 explosion at a [[sewage treatment|wastewater treatment plant]]  in [[Daytona Beach, Florida]].&lt;ref name="CSB2"&gt;{{cite journal

Health and medical care is overseen by the [[Ministry of Public Health (Thailand)|Ministry of Public Health]] (MOPH), along with several other non-ministerial government agencies. Total national expenditure on health amounted to 4.3% of GDP in 2009.

=={{anchor|Healthcare systems}}Infrastructure==
[[File:Siriraj_Hospital,Bangkok.jpg|thumb|300px|Siriraj Hospital, Bangkok, the oldest and largest hospital in Thailand.]]

Most services in Thailand are delivered by the public sector, which by 2010, included 1,002 hospitals and 9,765 health stations. [[Universal health care]] is provided through three programs: the civil service welfare system for civil servants and their families, Social Security for private employees, and the universal coverage scheme that is theoretically available to all other Thai nationals. Some private hospitals are participants in the programs, but most are financed by patient self-payment and private insurance. According to the [[World Bank]], under Thailand’s health schemes, 99.5 percent of the population have health protection coverage.&lt;ref name="worldbank.org"&gt;{{cite news|title=Thailand: Sustaining Health Protection for All|url=http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/2012/08/20/thailand-sustaining-health-protection-for-all|accessdate=29 August 2012|publisher=World Bank Thailand}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The MOPH oversees national health policy and also operates most government health facilities. The National Health Security Office (NHSO) allocates funding through the universal coverage program. Other health-related government agencies include the Health System Research Institute (HSRI), Thai Health Promotion Foundation ("ThaiHealth"), National Health Commission Office (NHCO), and the Emergency Medical Institute of Thailand (EMIT). Although there have been national policies for decentralization, there has been resistance in implementing such changes and the MOPH still directly controls most aspects of health care.

Thailand introduced universal coverage reforms in 2001, one of only a handful of lower-middle income countries to do so. Means-tested health care for low-income households was replaced by a new and more comprehensive insurance scheme, originally known as the 30 [[Thai baht|baht]] project, in line with the small [[co-payment]] charged for treatment. People joining the scheme receive a gold card, which allows them to access services in their health district and, if necessary, to be referred for specialist treatment elsewhere.&lt;ref name="worldbank.org"/&gt;

The bulk of health financing comes from public revenues, with funding allocated to contracting units for primary care annually on a population basis. According to the WHO, 65 percent of Thailand's health care expenditure in 2004 came from the government, while 35 percent was from private sources. Thailand achieved universal coverage with relatively low levels of spending on health, but it faces significant challenges: rising costs, inequalities, and duplication of resources.&lt;ref name="worldbank.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WHOSIS"&gt;[http://www.who.int/whosis/database/core/core_select.cfm World Health Organization Statistical Information System: Core Health Indicators]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the reforms have received a good deal of criticism, they have proved popular with poorer Thais, especially in rural areas, and they survived the change of government after the 2006 military coup. Then, Public Health Minister, Mongkol Na Songkhla, abolished the 30 baht co-payment and made the scheme free. It is not yet clear whether the scheme will be modified further under the military government that came to power in May 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unescap.org/aphen/thailand_universal_coverage.htm ''The Universal Coverage Policy of Thailand: An Introduction''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119085813/http://www.unescap.org/aphen/thailand_universal_coverage.htm |date=2012-01-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="G20"&gt;G20 Health Care: "Health Care Systems and Health Market Reform in the G20 Countries."

In 2009, annual spending on health care amounted to 345 [[international dollar]]s per person in [[purchasing power parity]] (PPP). Total expenditures represented about 4.3 percent of [[gross domestic product]] (GDP). Of this amount, 75.8 percent came from public sources and 24.2 percent from private sources. Physician density was 2.98 per 10,000 population in 2004, with 22 hospital beds per 100,000 population in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Thailand - Country statistics|url=http://www.projetdeloi.info/?REF=19400|work=Global Health Observatory|publisher=World Health Organization|accessdate=21 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Data for utilization of health services in 2008 includes: 81% contraceptive prevalence, 80% antenatal care coverage with at least four visits, 99% of births attended by skilled health personnel, 98% measles immunization coverage among one-year-olds, and 82% success in treatment of smear-positive tuberculosis. Improved drinking-water sources were available to 98% of the population, and 96% were using improved sanitation facilities.&lt;ref name="GHO health profile"&gt;{{cite web|title=Thailand - Country health profile|url=http://www.who.int/gho/countries/tha.pdf|work=Global Health Observatory|publisher=World Health Organization|accessdate=21 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hospitals===
{{Main|Hospitals in Thailand}}
[[File:Thailand Bangkok Bumrungrad International Hospital Campus.jpg|thumb|right|275px|[[Bumrungrad International Hospital]], a private hospital]]

Most [[hospital]]s in Thailand are operated by the Ministry of Public Health. [[Private hospital]]s are regulated by the Medical Registration Division. Other government units and public organisations also operate hospitals, including the military, universities, local governments and the Red Cross.

=== Health Districts ===
Different provinces in Thailand are arranged into different health districts by region. Each health district is responsible for about 3-6 million people living in those provinces. It aims to provide better quality medical services for citizens within that region and increased efficiency in terms of transferring patients to other hospitals if there is a lack in capability of care within that district. Health districts in Thailand are organised into the following categories, as of August 2017&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hfocus.org/sites/default/files/files_upload/ruupekhtsukhphaaph.pdf|title=Map of Health Districts in Thailand|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hfocus.org/sites/default/files/files_upload/aebngekhtsukhphaaph.pdf|title=Table of health districts in Thailand|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;:

===First responders===
Thailand has an unconventional approach to providing first responders in an emergency: it sends volunteers. Some 65 percent of emergency cases in Bangkok are handled by volunteers. Fully equipped ambulances with professional staff are sent only if required.&lt;ref name="AJ-20140424"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Calderon|first1=Biel|title=In Pictures: Thailand's emergency volunteers| url=https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/inpictures/2014/04/pictures-thailand-emergency-vo-2014423172440923267.html|accessdate=24 April 2018|work=Al Jazeera|date=2014-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

There are three levels of medical emergency help in Thailand, from first responder (FR) level to basic life support (BLS) level, and advanced life support (ALS) level. Most volunteers have attained the FR level. They are affiliated with foundations and local administrative bodies.&lt;ref name="Nation-20171206"&gt;{{cite news|title=Rescue workers say first responders not ready for new training rule|url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/detail/national/30333257|accessdate=24 April 2018|work=The Nation|date=2017-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Thailand's Medical Emergency Hotline centre responds to about 1.5 million medical emergencies each year. About a million involved FR teams transporting patients to medical facilities. BLS and ALS teams handled about 200,000 cases each.&lt;ref name="Nation-20171206" /&gt;

Two organizations, the Poh Teck Tung Foundation and the Ruamkatanyu Foundation, are the two largest free first responders in Bangkok. They rely on private donations, but sometimes volunteers must use their own money to buy vehicles, gas, uniforms, and medical equipment. Volunteers are not allowed to accept money from hospitals or from victims. The volunteers say they do this to help people or as a way to earn karma for the next life.&lt;ref name="AJ-20140424" /&gt; The training level of volunteers is not high, just 24 hours. The National Institute of Emergency Medicine (NIEMS) is seeking to increase minimum training to 40 hours, a move initially opposed by the Rescue Network of Thailand, an association of voluntary first responders.&lt;ref name="Nation-20171206" /&gt;  

Not all first responder organizations are altruistic. Significant money must be at stake{{CN|date=April 2018}} as, sometimes, competition for patients between organizations leads to turf wars and even gun play.&lt;ref name="Nation-20180423"&gt;{{cite news|title=Arrest made in bloody row between Bangkok rescue crews| url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/detail/breakingnews/30343762|accessdate=24 April 2018|work=The Nation|date=23 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At 4:27 it can be deduced from the burn shape that the man was facing the [[Nuclear weapon yield|fireball]] and was wearing a vest at the time of the explosion. Many of the burn injuries exhibit raised [[keloid]] healing patterns. 25 female survivors required extensive post-war surgeries, and were termed the Hiroshima maidens.]]

The '''Hiroshima Maidens''' are a group of 25 [[Japan]]ese women who were school age girls when they were seriously disfigured as a result of the thermal flash of the [[fission bomb]] dropped on [[Hiroshima]] on the morning of August 6, 1945. They subsequently went on a highly publicized journey to get reconstructive surgery in the US in 1955.

[[Keloid]] scars from their burns marred their faces and many of their hand burns healed into bent claw-like positions. These women, as well as the other citizens affected by the A-bomb, were referred to as [[hibakusha]], meaning "explosion-affected people".

The tighter fitting parts of clothing, such as the shoulders, are the most severe. Loose fitting sections show no burning.]]

==Creation==
By 1951, [[Little Boy|Hiroshima bomb]] survivor Shigeko Niimoto had endured several unsuccessful Japanese operations to repair scarring on her face. Following a Christian church meeting with Reverend [[Kiyoshi Tanimoto]], he invited her to a meeting of bomb-affected people. Upon arriving and finding the meetings discussion too political for her tastes, Niimoto suggested to Rev. Tanimoto that they form a [[support group]] for the [[dozen]] or so young women who he knew with similar injuries and concerns. Soon they were meeting regularly in the basement of his church. The women had all experienced similar lives following the war, such as being hidden from view by parents, stared at when they ventured outside, unwanted by employers, and rejected as potential wives for fear they were genetically damaged. As Tanimoto had gained some fame in America as a subject of a celebrated 1946 magazine/book article by journalist [[John Hersey]] titled ''[[Hiroshima (book)|Hiroshima]]'', Tanimoto joined American journalists to create a charitable foundation to help victims of Hiroshima and "explore the ways of peace".

Hersey, [[Pearl S. Buck]], [[Norman Cousins]] and Reverend Marvin Green were Tanimoto's partners in the Hiroshima Peace Centre Foundation.

The group of scarred women was one of the foundation's projects, with Tanimoto calling it the Society of [[Keloid]] Girls. Following the help from newspaper columnist, Shizue Masugi, Tanimoto began raising funds to get [[plastic surgery]] for his group. Newspapers dubbed them genbaku otome, or "atomic bomb maidens", and in 1952 about 20 of them were treated in Tokyo and Osaka. Plastic surgery in Japan was not as advanced as it was in the United States so Tanimoto tried to find a way to get the "maidens" to America. Once aware of his efforts ''[[Saturday Review (US magazine)|Saturday Review]]'' editor [[Norman Cousins]] pledged to help Tanimoto. They found two doctors, [[William Maxwell Hitzig]] and [[Arthur Barsky]] of [[Mount Sinai Hospital, New York]], who were willing to supervise the medical operations and on May 5, 1955, a group of 25 women in their teens and twenties departed for America. The more specific nickname for the group – the Hiroshima Maidens – caught on when the women were brought to The [[Mount Sinai Hospital, New York]] in the United States to undergo multiple [[reconstructive surgery|reconstructive surgeries]]. This highly publicized turn of events was largely the work of Cousins, an outspoken advocate of [[nuclear disarmament]].&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cbc.ca/archives/categories/war-conflict/second-world-war/shadows-of-hiroshima/the-hiroshima-maidens.html |title=The Hiroshima maidens}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media in the West==
Following their arrival, Tanimoto was the subject of the US TV program ''[[This Is Your Life]]'' on May 11, 1955. Before a studio audience, guests came forward to illustrate pivotal moments in Tanimoto's life. In the line-up were two of the Hiroshima maidens, their faces hidden behind a screen, and most surprising [[Robert A. Lewis|Captain Robert Lewis]], the co-pilot of the plane, the [[Enola Gay]], that dropped the [[Little Boy]] bomb on Hiroshima.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; The full film of this encounter appears to be lost as of 2004.&lt;ref&gt;Rakoff, David. [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F06E1D71331F932A25752C0A9629C8B63&amp;scp=4&amp;sq=lewis+%22enola+gay%22&amp;st=nyt "Theater; Hiroshima Bomber and Victims: This Is Your (Puppet's) Life"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', January 11, 2004. Accessed February 12, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In all, 138 surgeries were performed on 25 women over 18 months during their stay in the US. On their visit, the women lived with a charitable [[Quaker]] group of foster parents. Hiroko Tasaka, heard in the following [[Canadian Broadcasting Company]] (CBC) clip, was known as "Champion Surgery Girl" because she had 13 operations, more than anyone else.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; One maiden, Tomoko Nakabayashi, died of cardiac arrest while undergoing a reconstruction operation on 24 May 1956; the cause was declared by the doctors to have been from complications/errors in the operation, not from radiation effects.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref name="anu.edu.au"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://intersections.anu.edu.au/issue24/jacobs.htm|title=Intersections: Reconstructing the Perpetrator's Soul by Reconstructing the Victim's Body: The Portrayal of the 'Hiroshima Maidens' by the Mainstream Media in the United States|website=intersections.anu.edu.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Atomic Bomb Maidens==
Not all the atomic bomb maidens left for the US. Miyoko Matsubara states that she was one of 16 young "Hiroshima maidens" who received surgeries in Tokyo and then Osaka in 1953. After the 10 successful operations, together with 2 other Hiroshima maidens, they were then well enough and thus started work as live-in caretakers to disadvantaged children. When time came in 1955 to travel to Mt. Sinai Hospital in the US, unlike her two colleagues, she did not feel comfortable traveling to the country that bombed her and was "left behind alone".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wagingpeace.org/articles/1999/00/00_matsubara_spirit-hiroshima.php |title=
The Spirit of Hiroshima|quote=With the warm help of these people and many others, I became one of sixteen young women known as the "Hiroshima Maidens" who traveled to Tokyo and Osaka for hospital treatment. Eight years after the bombing, when I was 20, in May, 1953, I found myself in Osaka where I eventually underwent more than ten operations over a seven-month period. These operations were quite successful and, as a result, I was able to open and close my dysfunctional eyelid and to straighten out my crooked fingers. I was filled with gratitude towards those people who reached out with warm, loving hands and softly stroked my eyelid that wouldn't shut. I returned to Hiroshima, wishing for a way to express my thanks ... I and two other 'Hiroshima Maidens' began work there as live-in caretakers. From morning until night, we were mothers to these children, helping them with homework, meals, going to the bathroom, and changing and washing clothes. Exactly one year later, in May 1955, my two companions left this job to travel to Mt. Sinai Hospital in New York to undergo more cosmetic surgery. For myself, I just didn't feel right about traveling to the U.S., the country which had dropped the atomic bomb. I was left behind alone. |publisher=Wagingpeace.org |accessdate=2013-11-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130420074231/http://www.wagingpeace.org/articles/1999/00/00_matsubara_spirit-hiroshima.php |archivedate=April 20, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hiroshima-spirit.jp/en/voice/miyoko_e.html |title=Continue to Relate Stupidity of War and Dignity of Life To Dedicate My Life to Nuclear Abolition{{snd}}The Atomic Bombing does not Belong to the Past Story of Miyoko Matsubara}}&lt;/ref&gt;

None of the nearly equally disfigured young women at [[Nagasaki]] following the [[Fat Man]] fission bomb explosion on August 9, 1945, were in the group. There was no comparative Nagasaki Maiden charity organization: there was an effort from US cities to sponsor scarred survivors to travel to receive medical treatment, but this move is said to have been derailed by the US government.&lt;ref name="anu.edu.au"/&gt; Moreover, when the women traveled to the US, three Hiroshima surgeons came along, to study the American plastic surgery techniques. This medical training was done free of charge.&lt;ref name="anu.edu.au"/&gt; 
 
Presumably there were as many scarred boys as there were girls from the [[Little Boy]] bomb at Hiroshima, who also could not marry, and who were forced to live in the "twilight society of Hiroshima". They did not receive the same level of media and medical attention received as by the young women.&lt;ref name="anu.edu.au"/&gt; The use of the term "[[maiden]]" reveals the focus was on their attempts to attain romantic prospects with men.&lt;ref name="anu.edu.au"/&gt;

==Life after reconstruction==

A number of the maidens married and became mothers. Some gravitated towards social work. Toyoko Morita attended [[Parsons School of Design]], and later became a well known fashion designer in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;Barker, Rodney (1986). ''The Hiroshima Maidens''.  pp. 201&amp;ndash;12  {{ISBN|0140083529}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One maiden, Masako Tachibana, married and moved to Canada. She was not able to have children. On August 1, 1995, she gave an interview to
reporter Len Grant of CBC Television. She said although she was a schoolgirl ordered to demolish buildings to create [[firebreaks]] at the time of the bombing, and the bomb's flash ignited her clothes on fire, and it made her vomit (a symptom of [[acute radiation syndrome]]) &amp;ndash; she was glad the US had dropped the bomb. Tachibana said it was justified because it brought the war to a quicker resolution: Without it she does not believe the Japanese would have surrendered. Instead, more lives would have been lost, possibly close to all of Japan's population.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cbc.ca/archives/categories/war-conflict/second-world-war/shadows-of-hiroshima/bombing-was-justified-says-survivor.html |title=Hiroshima: Bombing was justified, says survivor}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is the author of the Japanese book ''Reaction to the flash''.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

{{As of|2017|alt=As of March 31, 2017}},  164,621 living [[hibakusha]] were certified by the Japanese government, with an average age of 81.41.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= https://mainichi.jp/english/articles/20170806/p2g/00m/0dm/026000c | title= Hiroshima marks 72nd A-bomb anniversary with eyes on ban treaty

An '''Immunization registry''' or '''Immunization Information System''' is a confidential, population-based, computerized information system that attempts to collect [[vaccination]] data about all persons within a geographic area. It consolidates the [[immunization]] records from multiple sources for each person living in its jurisdiction.

==Introduction==
Immunization Information Systems (IIS) are an important tool to increase and sustain high [[vaccination coverage]] by consolidating vaccination records of children and adults from multiple providers, forecasting next doses past due, due, and next due to support generating reminder and recall vaccination notices for each individual, and providing official vaccination forms and vaccination coverage assessments. One of the national health [[objective (goal)|objective]]s is to increase to 95% the proportion of children aged &lt;6 years who participate in fully operational population-based IIS.

A "fully operational" IIS includes 95% enrollment or higher of all [[catchment area (human geography)|catchment area]] children less than 6 years of age with 2 or more immunization encounters administered according to [[Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices|ACIP]] recommendations.

In a population-based IIS, children are entered into the IIS at birth, often through a linkage with electronic [[birth records]]. An IIS record also can be initiated by a [[health care provider]] at the time of a child's first immunization. If an IIS includes all children in a given [[geographical area]] and all providers are reporting immunization information, it can provide a single data source for all community immunization partners. Such a population-based IIS can make it easier to carry out the demonstrably effective immunization strategies (e.g., reminder/recall, [[AFIX]], and [[WIC]] linkages) and thereby decrease the resources needed to achieve and maintain high levels of coverage. IIS also can be used to enhance [[adult immunization]] services and coverage.

The concept of IIS is not new. Many individual practices and health plans administer immunizations to their patients. Records of these immunizations often are based on computerized information systems designed for other purposes such as [[Invoice|billing]]. There also is a growing movement toward the development of totally computerized patient [[medical records]]. Although an IIS includes all immunizations administered by health care providers participating in it, only population-based IIS are capable of providing information on all children and all doses of [[vaccine]]s administered by all providers.

The '''Institute for Work &amp; Health (IWH)''' is an independent, not-for-profit research organization based in [[Toronto]], [[Canada]]. Its mission is to “promote, protect and improve the safety and health of working people by conducting actionable research that is valued by employers, workers, and policy-makers.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.iwh.on.ca/mission-values-and-principles|title=IWH Mission, values and principles |accessdate=20 September 2016 |work=IWH Website  | date=9 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Operations ==
Since 2013, IWH has operated with core funding from the [[Government of Ontario]] through the [[Ministry of Labour (Ontario)]]. For the 22 years previous to that, since its founding in 1990, the core funder was Ontario’s [[Workplace Safety and Insurance Board]] and its predecessors. The institute maintains an arm’s-length relationship with its core funder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.iwh.on.ca/what-we-do |title=IWH What We Do |accessdate=20 September 2016 |work=IWH Website  | date=9 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Institute scientists also apply for and receive grants from peer-reviewed funding agencies in Canada, such as the [[Canadian Institutes of Health Research]] and the [[Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council]]. 
IWH’s board of directors includes senior business, labour and academic representatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.iwh.on.ca/board-of-directors|title=IWH Board of Directors |accessdate=20 September 2016 |work=IWH Website  | date=9 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A scientific advisory committee provides guidance on IWH research activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.iwh.on.ca/scientific-advisory-committee|title=IWH Scientific Advisory Committee |accessdate=20 September 2016 |work=IWH Website  | date=9 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
IWH has formal affiliations with four universities in Ontario, Canada: [[University of Toronto]], [[University of Waterloo]], [[McMaster University]] and [[York University]]. The institute has access to data sources from the [[Workplace Safety and Insurance Board]] and [[Statistics Canada]].
IWH is part of the health and safety system in Ontario.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.labour.gov.on.ca/english/hs/websites.php|title=Ontario Ministry of Labour Health and Safety Partners |accessdate=20 September 2016 |work=Ontario Ministry of Labour Website  | date=9 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research ==
IWH research falls into two broad areas:
* the prevention of work-related injury and illness (primary prevention), which includes studies of programs, policies and practices, and the health of workers in the population at large; and
* the health and recovery of injured workers (secondary prevention), which involves research on treatment, return to work, disability prevention and management, and compensation policy.
IWH research focuses on these topics:
* work-related musculoskeletal disorders
* occupational health and safety practices
* vulnerable workers (such as newcomers, young workers, temporary workers)
* regulations and incentives
* working conditions and health
* return-to-work practices
* clinical treatment
* compensation and benefits
* measurement of health and function. 
IWH also conducts systematic reviews of occupational health and safety research. Systematic reviews provide an overview of the evidence from higher quality studies on a specific research question.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.iwh.on.ca/systematic-reviews|title=IWH Systematic Reviews |accessdate=20 September 2016 |work=IWH Website  | date=9 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cochrane Back and Neck]] (formerly known as the Cochrane Back Review Group) is based at IWH and conducts systematic reviews of clinical research on back and neck pain.

== Publications, tools and guides ==
IWH has produced a number of tools and guides based on its research evidence,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.iwh.on.ca/products|title=IWH Products |accessdate=20 September 2016 |work=IWH Website  | date=9 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; including:

==Medicine==
The term "kokoro" is used in traditional Yoruba medicine to describe tiny, invisible worms or insects that are thought to live in small bags within the body, and perform useful functions such as aiding digestion and fertility.  They are thought to also carry [[sexually transmitted diseases]] and other diseases. If they become too powerful, they must be controlled, killed or driven out by bitter-tasting medicines. If kokoro are identified with bacteria and viruses, and the small bags are identified with cells, this is consistent with modern medical views.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Wisdom==
The Yoruba of [[Nigeria]] have a saying regarding the right to life of insects:
:''Yi ese re si apakan,&lt;br&gt;ma se te kokoro ni&lt;br&gt;kokoro ti iwo ko naani ni&lt;br&gt;Olorun lo le da a''
(Side step your feet do not kill that insect That insect you do not regard God also created.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Another saying, describing communal responsibility, is:
:''ti ara ile ani ba nje kokoro buruku ti a ko ba kilo fun&lt;br&gt;kurukere re ko ni je ki a sun loru'' 
(If your neighbour is eating bad insect, you should caution them, or your sleep will be disturbed at night).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Lazaretto Island''', (Greek: Λαζαρέτο, also '''Lazareto''', formerly known as '''Aghios Dimitrios''') is located two [[nautical mile]]s northeast of [[Corfu (city)|Corfu]]. The island has an area of {{convert|7|ha|acre|abbr=on}} and is administered by the Greek National Tourist Organization. It gets its name from the [[lazaretto]] located there.

During [[Venice|Venetian]] rule in the early 16th century a monastery was built on the [[islet]] and a [[leprosarium]] was established there later that century, after which the island was named.

In 1798, during the [[France|French]] occupation, it was occupied by the [[Russia|Russo]]-[[Turkey|Turkish]] fleet which ran it as a military hospital. During the [[British Empire|British]] occupation, in 1814, the leprosarium was again opened after renovations. After Enosis in 1864 the leprosarium saw occasional use.&lt;ref name="koine"/&gt;

During [[World War II]], the [[Axis Occupation of Greece]] established a [[concentration camp]] there for the prisoners of the [[Greek Resistance|Greek National Resistance movement]].&lt;ref name="Travel to Corfu"/&gt; There remains today the two-storied building that served as the Headquarters of the Italian army, a small church, and the wall against which those condemned to death were shot.&lt;ref name="koine"&gt;[http://koine.terapad.com/index.cfm?fa=contentNews.newsDetails&amp;newsID=10608&amp;from=list Corfu honored with a new museum]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Travel to Corfu"&gt;[http://www.travel-to-corfu.com/page.php?id=46&amp;back=corfu.php Travel to Corfu]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

'''Three referendums''' were held in [[Liechtenstein]] during 2009.&lt;ref name=NS&gt;[[Dieter Nohlen]] &amp; Philip Stöver (2010) ''Elections in Europe: A data handbook'', p 2057 {{ISBN|978-3-8329-5609-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first two were held on 29 March and concerned reforming level I of secondary schooling and the introduction of a smoking ban in restaurants, both of which were rejected by voters. The third was held on 6 December on overturning a law introduced in May 2008 which placed an upper level on the electromagnetic field from phone masts,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mast-victims.org/index.php?content=news&amp;action=view&amp;type=country&amp;id=188 News for Liechtenstein] Mast Victims&lt;/ref&gt; and was approved by 57% of voters.&lt;ref name=NS/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1999">The '''Maudsley Bipolar Twin Study''' is an ongoing [[twin study]] of [[bipolar disorder]] running at the [[Institute of Psychiatry]], [[King's College London]] since 2003.  The study is investigating possible differences between people with a [[Bipolar disorder#Diagnosis|diagnosis]] of bipolar disorder and people without the diagnosis.  In particular it is investigating difference in [[cognition]] and [[Brain|brain structure/function]].

The Maudsley Study of bipolar disorder investigates different aspects of thinking, such as memory and attention, in twins with and without bipolar disorder.  The tasks participants complete involve defining words and solving different kinds of problems. With adequate numbers of twins participating in the study, the hope is to understand any differences between these two groups. The eventual aim is to increase understanding of this complex mood disorder and to enhance future therapies for it.

The '''maxillary first molar''' is the [[human tooth]] located laterally (away from the midline of the [[face]]) from both the [[maxillary second premolar]]s of the [[mouth]] but mesial (toward the midline of the face) from both [[maxillary second molar]]s.

The function of this [[Molar (tooth)|molar]] is similar to that of all molars in regard to grinding being the principal action during [[mastication]], commonly known as chewing.

There are usually four [[cusp (dentistry)|cusp]]s on maxillary molars, two on the [[Anatomical terms of location#Teeth|buccal]] (side nearest the cheek) and two palatal (side nearest the [[palate]]).  There may also be a fifth smaller cusp on the palatal side known as the [[Cusp of Carabelli]].

Normally, maxillary molars have four lobes, two buccal and two [[Anatomical terms of location#Teeth|lingual]], which are named in the same manner as the cusps that represent them ([[Anatomical terms of location#Teeth|mesiobuccal, distobuccal, mesiolingual, and distolingual]] lobes). Unlike the anterior teeth and premolars, molars do not exhibit facial developmental depressions. Evidence of lobe separation can be found in the central groove, which divides buccal from lingual lobes. The two lingual lobes are separated by the distolingual groove, and the two buccal lobes are divided by the buccal groove.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last = Ash  | first = Major M.  |author2=Nelson, Stanley J.  | year = 2003  | title = Wheeler’s Dental Anatomy, Physiology, and Occlusion  | edition = 8th  | isbn = 0-7216-9382-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are great differences between the [[deciduous teeth|deciduous]] (baby) maxillary molars and those of the permanent maxillary molars, even though their function are similar.  The permanent maxillary molars are not considered to have any teeth that precede it.  Despite being named molars, the deciduous molars are followed by permanent premolars.

==Notation==
'''Permanent maxillary first molar notation'''

In the [[Universal numbering system (dental)|universal numbering system]], one number is used to identify the tooth.  The right permanent maxillary first molar is known as tooth "3", and the left permanent maxillary first molar is known as tooth "14".

In the [[Palmer notation]], a number and symbol are used to identify the tooth.  The number identifies the tooth position relative to the midline, and the symbol identifies the quadrant of the mouth.  Both maxillary first molars have the same number; ''6''.  However, the right molar has the symbol "┘" underneath it.  The left molar has "└" underneath it.

In the [[FDI World Dental Federation notation|international system of notation]] two numbers are used to identify the tooth.  The first number identifies the quadrant of the mouth.  The second number identifies the tooth relative to the midline of the arch.  The right permanent maxillary first molar is known as "16".  The left permanent maxillary first molar is known as "26".

'''Deciduous maxillary first molar notation'''

In the universal numbering system,  an uppercase letter is used to identify the tooth.  The right deciduous maxillary first molar is known as "B", and the left one is known as "I".

In the [[Palmer notation]], a letter and symbol are used to identify the tooth.  The letter identifies the tooth position relative to the midline, and the symbol identifies the quadrant of the mouth.  Both maxillary first molars have the same letter; ''E''.  However, the right molar has the symbol "┘" underneath it.  The left molar has "└" underneath it.

In the international system of notation two numbers are used to identify the tooth.  The right deciduous maxillary first molar is known as "54", and the left one is known as "64".

==External root morphology==
The maxillary first molar normally has three roots.

* The [[Anatomical terms of location#Teeth|mesiobuccal]] root is broad [[Anatomical terms of location#Teeth|distobuccal]] and has prominent depressions or flutings on its mesial and distal surfaces.  The internal canal morphology is highly variable, but the majority of the mesiobuccal roots contain two canals.
* The distobuccal root is generally rounded or ovoid in cross section and usually contains a single canal.
* The palatal root is more broad mesiodistally than buccolingually and ovoidal in shape but normally contains only a single canal. Although the palatal root generally appears straight on radiographs, there is usually a buccal curvature in the apical third.  Depressions on the buccal and palatal surfaces of the palatal root can be present but are generally shallow.

There are  prominent depressions found on the distal aspect of the mesiobuccal roots.  Depressions can also be found on the furcal side of the distobuccal and palatal roots.

The overall average length of the maxillary first molar is 20.5&amp;nbsp;mm with an average crown length of 7.5&amp;nbsp;mm and an average root length of 13&amp;nbsp;mm.&lt;ref&gt;J.

BC Decker Inc. {{ISBN|0-19-920409-8}}, {{ISBN|1-55009-333-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pathologies==
The maxillary first molars are the second most common [[dental caries|carious]] teeth and the second most common teeth to undergo [[endodontic treatment]] or [[tooth extraction|extraction]] (with [[mandibular first molar]]s the most common [[disease]]d teeth). Up to 21% of all extracted teeth are maxillary first molars.&lt;ref name="ZadikOOOOE"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Zadik Y, Sandler V, Bechor R, Salehrabi R |title=Analysis of factors related to extraction of endodontically treated teeth |journal=Oral Surg Oral Med Oral Pathol Oral Radiol Endod |volume= 106|issue= 5|pages= e31|date=August 2008 |pmid=18718782 |doi=10.1016/j.tripleo.2008.06.017 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3134">The term '''natural health product''' (NHP) is used in [[Canada]] to describe substances such as [[vitamins]] and [[Dietary mineral|minerals]], [[herbal medicine]]s, [[homeopathic]] preparations, [[energy drinks]], [[probiotics]], and many [[Alternative medicine|alternative]] and [[traditional medicine]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/dhp-mps/prodnatur/faq/question_general-eng.php#4 "FAQs, Natural Health Products, Health Canada"]&lt;/ref&gt; A 2010 survey showed that 73% of Canadians consume NHP on a regular basis.  NHP are obtainable without a prescription and are required to be safe to be used as an over-the-counter product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Natural Health Products|url=http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/dhp-mps/prodnatur/index-eng.php|website=Health Canada|publisher=Health Canada|accessdate=12 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Regulation ==
Natural health care products are currently regulated under the Natural Health Product Regulations, under the authority of the [[Food and Drugs Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2003-196/|title=Consolidated federal laws of canada, Natural Health Products Regulations|last=Branch|first=Legislative Services|website=laws-lois.justice.gc.ca|language=en|access-date=2017-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The regulations address the sale of natural health products, manufacture, packaging, labelling and importation for sale of natural health products, the distribution of natural health products, and the storage of natural health products.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gazette.gc.ca/archives/p2/2003/2003-06-18/html/sor-dors196-eng.html "Natural Health Product Regulations"]&lt;/ref&gt;  Under the regulations, all natural health products require a Natural Product Number (NPN), analogous to the [[Drug Identification Number]]s (DINs) used to identify and monitor drugs in Canada.

Natural Health Products are defined in [[Canada]] as:

*Vitamins and minerals
[[File:Székely Land - Great Market Hall, 2014.09.12 (10).JPG|thumb|Salt of Székely Land, 2014]]
*[[Herbal remedies]]
*[[Homeopathic]] medicines
*Traditional medicines such as traditional Chinese medicines
*[[Probiotics]], and
*Other products like [[amino acid]]s and [[essential fatty acid]]s.

==Risks==
NHPs are safe to consume and generally have less side effects than traditional drug medications.  However, NHP are not risk free and have potential for some risks.  These may come about from manufacturing problems (contamination, incorrect dose), misrepresented or unproven claims on the label, unexpected side effects (allergic reaction), or interaction with other medication/NHPs also being consumed.  It has been reported that 12% of Canadians have experienced unwanted side effects due to the consumption of NHPs.  It is recommended that you do your research and consult a health care professional if you are concerned with the potential risks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Natural Health Products|url=http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/dhp-mps/prodnatur/about-apropos/cons-eng.php#a2|website=Health Canada|accessdate=12 February 2015|ref=Health Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Oku-Kōmyō-En Sanatorium''' (光明園), or '''National Sanatorium Oku-Kōmyō-En''' is a [[sanatorium]] for [[leprosy]] and ex-leprosy patients on the island of Nagashima, Oku-machi, [[Setouchi, Okayama]], Japan. The same island holds the [[Nagashima Aiseien Sanatorium|National Sanatorium Nagashima Aiseien]]. As of December 2, 2005, the Oku-Kōmyō-En housed 252 residents (131 males and 121 females).

==History==
Sotojima Hoyoen Sanatorium opened April 1, 1909 in Nakashima, Nishiyodogawa-ku, [[Osaka]] for patients in [[Kyoto]] fu, [[Hyogo]] prefecture, [[Nara Prefecture]], [[Wakayama prefecture]], [[Mie Prefecture|Mie]] prefecture, [[Shiga]] prefecture, [[Gifu Prefecture]], [[Fukui Prefecture]], [[Ishikawa Prefecture]], [[Toyama Prefecture]], and [[Tottori Prefecture]].

The sanatorium, built in the Kanzaki River delta valley, was hit by the [[1934 Muroto typhoon|Muroto typhoon]] on September 21, 1934. The storm left 2,702 dead and 334 missing, including 187 people in the sanatorium (173 patients, 3 employees, and 11 family members). On September 24, 1934, the Interior Ministry decided to transfer 416 survivors to other sanatoriums, including [[Nagashima Aiseien Sanatorium]] (78 patients), Kyushu Sanatorium ([[Kikuchi Keifuen Sanatorium]]) (50 patients), Ooshima Sanatorium (70 patients), Zensho Byoin ([[Tama Zenshoen Sanatorium]]) (70 patients), Hokubu Hoyoen Sanatorium (50 patients), and [[Kuryu Rakusen-en Sanatorium]] (98 patients).

===Timeline===
*April 1938: Prefectural Oku-Kōmyō-En Sanatorium was opened at Nagashima Island, neighboring Nagashima Aiseien Sanatorium
*July 1941: National Leprosarium Oku-Kōmyō-En   
*1946: National Sanatorium Oku-Kōmyō-En   
*May 9, 1988: the Oku-Nagashima-Oohashi Bridge was completed from the mainland to the islands of Oku-Kōmyō-En and Nagashima Airakuen
*April 1996: The 1953 Leprosy Prevention Law was abolished
*July 1998: The trial for compensation started
*May 11, 2001: The trial for compensation ruled that the previous Leprosy Prevention was unconstitutional
*May 25, 2001: The trial for compensation was confirmed. The compensation of 8,000,000 yen to 14,000,000 yen was given to patients, depending on the duration of unconstitutional periods

===Number of patients at end of fiscal year===
The number of inpatients in a given year depends not only on those newly hospitalized and the recently deceased, but also on other factors such as patient escapes and discharges, depending on the conditions of the times. Recently, the sanatorium was encouraged to discharge patients {{by whom|date=January 2013}}, but a long-standing segregation and the resulting stigma against leprosy patients might have influenced the number of patients discharged.

'''Opitz G/BBB syndrome''', also known as '''Opitz syndrome''', '''G syndrome''' or '''BBB syndrome''', is a rare [[genetic disorder]] that will affect physical structures along the midline of the body.&lt;ref&gt;Chen, J., &amp; Chen, J. (2015, 7 19). Opitz GBBB Syndrome. Retrieved 7 19, 2015, from Hinsdale Township High School District 86: http://www.hinsdale86.org/staff/kgabric/Disease15/Opitz%20GBBB%20Syndrome/&lt;/ref&gt; The letters G and BBB represent the last names of the families that were first [[diagnosed]] with the disorder, while [[Opitz]] is the last name of the doctor that first described the signs and symptoms of the disease. There are two different forms of Optiz G/BBB syndrome: [[x-linked]] (recessive) syndrome (Type I; XLOS; OSX) and [[dominance (genetics)|dominant]] [[autosomal]] syndrome (Type II; ADOS). However, both result in common physical [[deformities]], although their pattern of inheritance may differ. Several other names for the disease(s) are no longer used. These include hypospadias-dysphagia syndrome, Opitz-Frias syndrome, [[telecanthus]] with associated [[abnormalities]], and [[hypertelorism]]-[[hypospadias]] syndrome.&lt;ref&gt;Meroni, G. (2011, July 28). X-Linked Opitz G/BBB Syndrome. GeneReviews . Seattle, Washington, USA: University of Washington, Seattle.&lt;/ref&gt;

One out of every 50,000 to 100,000 males is born with X-linked type II Optiz G/BBB syndrome, but professionals believe that condition is under diagnosed and there are actually many more cases.&lt;ref&gt;Meroni, G. (2011, July 28). X-Linked Opitz G/BBB Syndrome. GeneReviews . Seattle, Washington, USA: University of Washington, Seattle.&lt;/ref&gt; It is unknown as to how many autosomal dominant cases exist. However, the autosomal dominant cases are also categorized under a more commonly diagnosed group called [[22q11.2 deletion syndrome]]. This group includes several other diseases that all result because of a small deletion of [[chromosome 22]] at the q11.2 location.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. National Library of Medicine. (2015, January 1). Opitz G/BBB Syndrome. Retrieved July 19, 2015, from Genetics Home Reference: http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/opitz-g-bbb-syndrome&lt;/ref&gt;

==Symptoms==
The three most common symptoms of Opitz G/BBB syndrome (both type I &amp; II) are [[hypertelorism]] (exceptionally wide-spaced eyes), [http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/837879-overview laryngo-tracheo-esophalgeal defects] (including clefts and holes in the palate, larynx, trachea and esophagus) and hypospadias (urinary openings in males not at the tip of the penis) (Meroni, Opitz G/BBB syndrome, 2012). Abnormalities in the larynx, trachea and esophagus can cause significant difficulty breathing and/or swallowing and can result in [[Pneumonia|reoccurring pneumonia]] and [[life-threatening]] situations. Commonly, there may be a gap between the trachea and esophagus, referred to as a [[laryngeal cleft]]; which can allow food or fluid to enter the airway and make breathing and eating a difficult task.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. National Library of Medicine. (2015, January 1). Opitz G/BBB Syndrome. Retrieved July 19, 2015, from Genetics Home Reference: http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/opitz-g-bbb-syndrome&lt;/ref&gt; 

Genital abnormalities like a urinary opening under the penis ([[hypospadias]]), undescended testes ([[cryptorchidism]]), underdeveloped [[scrotum]] and a scrotum divided into two lobes ([http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/489956_8 bifid scrotum]) can all be commonplace for males with the disease.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. National Library of Medicine. (2015, January 1). Opitz G/BBB Syndrome. Retrieved July 19, 2015, from Genetics Home Reference: http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/opitz-g-bbb-syndrome&lt;/ref&gt;

Developmental delays of the brain and nervous system are also common in both types I and II of the disease.&lt;ref&gt;McKusick, V. A. (2015, March 17). Opitz GBBB Syndrome, Type I. Cleveland, Ohio, USA: Johns Hopkins University.&lt;/ref&gt; 50% of people with Opitz G/BBB Syndrome will experience developmental delay and mild [[intellectual disability]]. This can impact [[motor skills]], [[speech]] and learning capabilities. Some of these instances are likened to [[autistic spectrum]] disorders. Close to half of the people with Opitz G/BBB Syndrome also have a [[cleft lip]] (hole in the lip opening) and possibly a [[cleft palate]] (hole in the roof of the mouth), as well. Less than half of the people diagnosed have [[heart defects]], [[imperforate anus]] (obstructed anal opening), and [[brain]] [[Congenital disorder|defects]].&lt;ref&gt;U.S. National Library of Medicine. (2015, January 1). Opitz G/BBB Syndrome. Retrieved July 19, 2015, from Genetics Home Reference: http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/opitz-g-bbb-syndrome&lt;/ref&gt; Of all the impairments, female carriers of X-linked Type I Opitz G/BBB Syndrome usually only have [[ocular hypertelorism]].&lt;ref&gt;Meroni, G. (2011, July 28). X-Linked Opitz G/BBB Syndrome. GeneReviews . Seattle, Washington, USA: University of Washington, Seattle.&lt;/ref&gt;
==Cause ==
Opitz G/BBB Syndrome is a rare genetic condition caused by one of two major types of mutations: MID1 mutation on the short (p) arm of the X chromosome or a mutation of the 22q11.2 gene on the 22nd chromosome.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. National Library of Medicine. (2015, January 1). Opitz G/BBB Syndrome. Retrieved July 19, 2015, from Genetics Home Reference: http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/opitz-g-bbb-syndrome&lt;/ref&gt; Since it is a genetic disease, it is an [[Inheritance|inherited]] condition. However, there is an extremely wide variability in how the disease presents itself.

==Mechanism==
Both X-linked Type I and Autosomal dominant Type II Optiz G/BBB syndromes are caused by [[genetic mutations]]. However, while the X-linked form is caused by a mutation on the midline 1 ([[MID1]]) gene on the short (p) arm of the [[X chromosome]]; the autosomal dominant form is due to a mutation on chromosome 22. Both forms of the disease result in physical deformities along the centerline of the body.

In X-linked Type I patients, the mutation in the MID1 gene leads to less functional midline-1 proteins. These proteins are responsible for binding to the [[cytoskeleton]] and assist the cell during [[cell division]]. It seems these issues with early cell division have a significant impact on the physical deformities that typically accompany the disease.

Autosomal dominant Type II patients endure a mutation on chromosome 22, most commonly at 22q11.2. Some researchers consider Opitz G/BBB syndrome to be a type of 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (a slightly different and broader disease). In some cases of autosomal dominant Opitz G/BBB syndrome, the disease is caused by a mutation in the [https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=SPECC1L SPECC1L gene] (near the 22q11.2 gene), which helps make cytospin-A. [http://www.nextprot.org/db/entry/NX_Q69YQ0 Cytospin-A] is a protein imperative to the formation of facial features and is often considered responsible for the [[cleft lip]] or [[palate]] that Opitz G/BBB syndrome patients will have.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. National Library of Medicine. (2015, January 1). Opitz G/BBB Syndrome. Retrieved July 19, 2015, from Genetics Home Reference: http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/opitz-g-bbb-syndrome&lt;/ref&gt;

Since physical abnormalities can affect all body parts along the midline of the body, many different body systems are at risk of being damaged. Those systems commonly affected are the [[Nervous system|nervous]], [[Digestive system|digestive]], [[Cardiovascular system|cardiovascular]], [[Respiratory system|respiratory]] and [[Reproductive system|reproductive]].&lt;ref&gt;McKusick, V. A. (2015, March 17). Opitz GBBB Syndrome, Type I. Cleveland, Ohio, USA: Johns Hopkins University.&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, those diagnosed with either type of Opitz G/BBB syndrome will also have [[ocular hypertelorism]], or eyes that are excessively spaced apart. Patients will commonly experience physical defects in the [[larynx]], [[trachea]] and [[esophagus]] and will often cause breathing and swallowing difficulties. Further facial [[Congenital anomaly|anomalies]] may occur, such as a [https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003301.htm prominent forehead], [[Widow's peak|widow’s peak]], [https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003057.htm broad nasal bridge]. Those with the disease may also experience [[hypospadias]] (urinary opening in males is not at the head of the penis) and [[developmental delay]], as well.&lt;ref&gt;McKusick, V. A. (2015, March 17). Opitz GBBB Syndrome, Type I. Cleveland, Ohio, USA: Johns Hopkins University.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diagnosis==
X-linked type I Opitz G/BBB Syndrome is diagnosed on clinical findings, but those findings can vary greatly: even within the same family. Manifestations of X-linked type I are classified in the frequent/major findings and minor findings that are found in less than 50% of individuals.&lt;ref&gt;Meroni, G. (2011, July 28). X-Linked Opitz G/BBB Syndrome. GeneReviews . Seattle, Washington, USA: University of Washington, Seattle.&lt;/ref&gt;

The three major findings that suggest a person has X-linked Type I Opitz G/BBB Syndrome:
#	[[Ocular hypertelorism]] (~100% cases)
#	[[Hypospadias]] (85-90% cases)
#	Laryngotracheoesophageal abnormalities (60-70%)

Minor findings found in less than 50% of individuals:
#	[[Developmental delay]] (especially intellectually)
#	[[Cleft lip/palate]]
#	[[Congenital heart defects]]
#	[[Imperforate anus|Imperforate]] (blocked) anus
#	Brain defects (especially [[corpus callosum]])

&lt;ref&gt;Meroni, G. (2011, July 28). X-Linked Opitz G/BBB Syndrome. GeneReviews . Seattle, Washington, USA: University of Washington, Seattle.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, Hogdall used ultra[[Ultrasonogram|sonographs]] to diagnose X-linked Type I Opitz G/BBB Syndrome after 19 weeks of pregnancy, by identifying hypertelorism (widely-spaced eyes) and hypospadias (irregular urinary tract openings in the penis).&lt;ref&gt;McKusick, V. A. (2015, March 17). Opitz GBBB Syndrome, Type I. Cleveland, Ohio, USA: Johns Hopkins University.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also [[molecular]] [[genetic testing]] available to identify mutations leading to Opitz G/BBB Syndrome. X-linked Type I testing must be done on MID1, since this is the only gene that is known to cause Type I Opitz G/BBB Syndrome. Two different tests can be performed: [[sequence analysis]] and [http://www.genedx.com/test-catalog/exonarraydx-deldup-testing/ deletion/duplication analysis]. In the sequence analysis a positive result would detect 15-50% of the [[DNA]] sequence mutated, while a deletion/duplication positive result would find deletion or duplication of one or more [[exons]] of the entire MID1 gene.&lt;ref&gt;Meroni, G. (2011, July 28). X-Linked Opitz G/BBB Syndrome. GeneReviews . Seattle, Washington, USA: University of Washington, Seattle.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prevention==

In terms of prevention, several researchers strongly suggest [[prenatal]] testing for at-risk pregnancies if a MID1 mutation has been identified in a family member. Doctors can perform a fetal sex test through chromosome analysis and then screen the DNA for any mutations causing the disease. Knowing that a child may be born with Opitz G/BBB syndrome could help physicians prepare for the child’s needs and the family prepare emotionally. Furthermore, [[genetic counseling]] for young adults that are affected, are carriers or are at risk of carrying is strongly suggested, as well (Meroni, Opitz G/BBB syndrome, 2012). Current research suggests that the cause is genetic and no known environmental risk factors have been documented. The only education for prevention suggested is genetic testing for at-risk young adults when a mutation is found or suspected in a family member.&lt;ref&gt;Meroni, G. (2011, July 28). X-Linked Opitz G/BBB Syndrome. GeneReviews . Seattle, Washington, USA: University of Washington, Seattle.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment and Prognosis==
Because the variability of this disease is so great and the way that it reveals itself could be multi-faceted; once diagnosed, a multidisciplinary team is recommended to treat the disease and should include a [[craniofacial surgeon]], [[ophthalmologist]], [[pediatrician]], pediatric [[urologist]], [[cardiologist]], [[pulmonologist]], [[speech pathologist]], and a medical [[geneticist]]. Several important steps must be followed, as well.
*	Past medical history 
*	Physical examination with special attention to size and measurements of facial features, palate, heart, [[genitourinary]] system and lower [[respiratory system]]
*	[[Eye evaluation]]
*	Hypospadias assessment by urologist
*	[[Laryngoscopy]] and [[chest x-ray]] for difficulties with breathing/swallowing
*	Cleft lip/palate assessment by craniofacial surgeon
*	Assessment of standard age developmental and intellectual abilities
*	Anal position assessment
*	[[Echocardiogram]]
*	Cranial imaging
Many surgical repairs may be needed, as assessed by professionals. Furthermore, [[special education]] therapies and [https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/psychoemotional psychoemotional] therapies may be required, as well. In some cases, [https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002925.htm antireflux] drugs can be prescribed until risk of breathing and swallowing disorders are removed. Genetic counseling is highly advised to help explain who else in the family may be at risk for the disease and to help guide [[family planning]] decisions in the future.&lt;ref&gt;Meroni, G. (2011, July 28). X-Linked Opitz G/BBB Syndrome. GeneReviews . Seattle, Washington, USA: University of Washington, Seattle.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of its wide variability in which defects will occur, there is no known mortality rate specifically for the disease. However, the leading cause of death for people with Opitz G/BBB syndrome is due to infant death caused by [[aspiration pneumonia|aspiration]] due to esophageal, pharyngeal or laryngeal defects.&lt;ref&gt;Right Diagnosis. (2015, April 17). Complications of Opitz G/BBB Syndrome. (Health Grades, Inc.) Retrieved July 28, 2015, from Right Diagnosis from healthgrades: http://www.rightdiagnosis.com/o/opitz_g_bbb_syndrome/complic.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
Fortunately, to date there are no factors that can increase the expression of symptoms of this disease. All abnormalities and symptoms are present at birth.&lt;ref&gt;Meroni, G. (2011, July 28). X-Linked Opitz G/BBB Syndrome. GeneReviews . Seattle, Washington, USA: University of Washington, Seattle.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the symptoms caused by this disease are present at birth, there is no “cure.” The best cure that scientists are researching is awareness and [[genetic testing]] to determine risk factors and increase knowledgeable family planning. [[Preventive medicine|Prevention]] is the only option at this point in time for a cure.

'''Radiation Exposure Monitoring''' (REM) is a framework developed by [[Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise]] (IHE), for utilizing existing [[technical standard]]s, such as [[DICOM]], to provide information about the [[Absorbed dose|dose]] delivered to patients in [[radiology]] procedures, in an [[interoperable]] format.

Ready access to dose information aids medical staff, including [[radiographer]]s, [[radiologist]]s and [[medical physicist]]s, in the [[radiation protection]] goal of reducing doses to a level [[ALARP|"as low as reasonably practicable"]].&lt;ref name="IHEwiki"&gt;{{cite web|title=Radiation Exposure Monitoring|url=http://wiki.ihe.net/index.php/Radiation_Exposure_Monitoring|website=IHE Wiki|accessdate=1 June 2017|language=en|date=7 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Collecting and using dose data==
A challenge in automating the reporting of [[Ionizing radiation|radiation exposure]] estimations has traditionally been a function of whether the record of dose provided by a manufacturer is persistent (i.e. stored electronically) or transient (i.e. displayed on a read-out). Many current radiology devices provide only transient records, either in the form of human-readable dose screens that require manual intervention (i.e. pencil and paper) to permanently capture the patient exposure, or else in the equally perishable data generated by a modality-performed procedure step (MPPS) created to help manage the scheduling system.
 
MPPS is insufficient, having a limited ability to encode complex data, and no options for long-term storage or queries. Newer scanners are able to create [[DICOM]] radiation dose structured reports (RDSRs) alongside the images themselves. REM addresses perishable dose data by creating a persistent record that can be sent to a central repository, and then queried and analyzed by health information systems for either a specific patient's history or for analysis of radiation exposure levels among patient groups, platforms, or clinical operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=O’Donnell|first1=Kevin|title=Radiation exposure monitoring: a new IHE profile|journal=Pediatric Radiology|date=14 April 2011|volume=41|issue=5|pages=588–591|doi=10.1007/s00247-010-1903-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; RDSRs, and the use of the IHE REM framework are part of the [[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] 61910 standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IEC 61910-1:2014|url=https://webstore.iec.ch/publication/6091|website=International Electrotechnical Commission|accessdate=1 June 2017|language=en|date=24 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Standards and Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise (IHE) ==

[[Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise]] (IHE) is an initiative by [[healthcare professional]]s and industry to improve the way computer systems in healthcare share information. IHE "Integration Profiles" are designed make systems easier to implement and integrate, and help care providers use information more effectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Profiles|url=https://www.ihe.net/Profiles/|website=IHE|accessdate=1 June 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
IHE Integration Profiles describe clinical information management use cases and specify how to use existing standards ([[HL7]], DICOM, etc.) to address them. Systems that implement integration profiles solve interoperability problems. For equipment vendors, Integration Profiles are implementation guides. For healthcare providers, Integration Profiles are shorthand for integration requirements in purchasing documents. Integration Statements tell customers the IHE Profiles supported by a specific release of a specific product.

The REM Profile enables [[Medical imaging|imaging modalities]] to export radiation exposure estimation details in a standard format. Radiation reporting systems can either query for these "dose objects" periodically from an archive, or receive them directly from the modalities. The radiation reporting system is expected to perform relevant dose QA analysis and produce related reports. The analysis methods and report format are not considered topics for standardization and are not covered in the profile.

The profile also describes how radiation reporting systems can submit dose estimation reports to centralized registries such as might be run by professional societies or national accreditation groups. In the [[United States]], the [[American College of Radiology]] DIR&lt;ref&gt;[https://nrdr.acr.org/Portal/DIR/Main/page.aspx American College of Radiology (ACR) Dose Index Registry (DIR)]&lt;/ref&gt; is one such registry. By profiling automated methods, the profile allows dose information to be collected and evaluated without imposing a significant administrative burden on staff otherwise occupied with caring for patients.

In addition to supporting profile [[quality assurance]] (QA) of the technical process at the local facility, (e.g. determining if the dose was appropriate for the procedure performed), the profile also supports population analysis performed by national registries. Compliant software products are capable of de-identifying and submitting dose reports to a national dose register securely, making it relatively simple for groups such as ACR to collect and process dose data from across the country once they have recruited participating sites.

== Challenges ==

=== Fluoroscopy monitoring ===

Most [[fluoroscopic]] x-ray equipment can provide an estimate of the cumulative dose that would have resulted to a point on the skin if the x-ray beam was stationary during the complete procedure. Such an estimate is derived from the fluoroscopic technique factors and the total exposure time, including any image recording, or from built-in dosimetry systems. However, these systems, known as [[dose area product]] meters (DAP meters), do not directly provide skin dose information without further knowledge of the sizes of the x-ray beam during the entire procedure. The relationship between cumulative skin dose and peak skin dose is highly variable, as has been demonstrated in a number of publications.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jointcommission.org/about/JointCommissionFaqs.aspx?CategoryId=8 The Joint Commission FAQ Page]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Limitations of dose monitoring ===
According to IHE, "It is important to understand the technical and practical limitations of dose monitoring and the reasons why the monitored values may not accurately provide the radiation dose administered to the patient":&lt;ref name="IHEwiki" /&gt;
	
# The values provided by this tool are not "measurements" but only calculated estimates.
# For [[CT scan|computed tomography]], "CTDI" is a dose estimate to a standard [[plastic]] phantom. Plastic is not human tissue. Therefore, the dose should not be represented as the dose received by the patient.
# For planar or projection imaging, the recorded values may be exposure, skin dose or some other value that may not be patient's body or organ dose.
# It is inappropriate and inaccurate to add up dose estimates received by different parts of the body into a single cumulative value.

Despite such limitations, interest in monitoring radiation dose estimates is clearly expressed in such documents as the [[Europe]]an directive [[Euratom]] 97/43&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/energy/nuclear/radioprotection/doc/legislation/9743_en.pdf Eurotom 97/43] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121030110613/http://ec.europa.eu/energy/nuclear/radioprotection/doc/legislation/9743_en.pdf |date=2012-10-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the American College of Radiology Dose Whitepaper.&lt;ref&gt;[http://download.journals.elsevierhealth.com/pdfs/journals/1546-1440/PIIS1546144007001081.pdf ACR White Paper on Radiation Dose in Medicine]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rita Süssmuth''' ({{IPA-de|ˈʁiːta ˈzʏsmuːt}}; born 17 February 1937) is a German politician and a member of the Christian Democratic Union ([[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|CDU]]).

==Early life and education==
Süssmuth graduated as a Doctor of Philosophy from the [[University of Münster]] in 1964. From 1966 until 1982, she was a faculty member in education at [[Dortmund University of Technology|University of Dortmund]], [[Ruhr University]], and their predecessor institutions.

==Political career==
From 1985 to 1988, Süssmuth was [[Federal Ministry of Family Affairs, Senior Citizens, Women and Youth|Federal Minister of Family Affairs, Senior Citizens, Women and Youth]] under Chancellor [[Helmut Kohl]]. In late 1989, she joined forces with [[Lothar Späth]], [[Heiner Geißler]], [[Kurt Biedenkopf]] and others in an unsuccessful effort to oust Kohl as CDU chairman.&lt;ref&gt;Harry Luck (January 28, 2010), [http://www.focus.de/politik/deutschland/tid-17008/biedenkopf-koenig-kurt-und-kohls-rivale_aid_474699.html Biedenkopf: „König Kurt“ und Kohls Rivale] ''[[Focus (German magazine)|Focus]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Süssmuth was a member of the German [[Bundestag]] from 1987 to 2002. After the resignation of [[Philipp Jenninger]] in 1988 she became the 10th [[President of the Bundestag]]. She held the post until 1998, when the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]] became the strongest group in parliament.

From 1986 to 2001, Süssmuth was president of the ''Frauenunion'' (the organization of the female members of the CDU) and therefore had a strong influence in her party.

==Life after politics==
In September 2000, [[Federal Ministry of the Interior (Germany)|Federal Minister of the Interior]] [[Otto Schily]] appointed Süssmuth as head of a high-profile bipartisan commission to overhaul Germany's immigration policies.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2001/07/30/opinion/germany-s-need-for-immigrants.html Germany's Need for Immigrants] ''[[New York Times]]'', 30 July 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2005, she has been president of the [[OTA Hochschule]], a private university in [[Berlin]].

After leaving politics, Süssmuth has been involved in a number of philanthropic and business activities, including the following: 
* [[UNAIDS|UNAIDS High Level Commission on HIV Prevention]], Co-Chair (since 2010)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unaids.org/en/resources/presscentre/pressreleaseandstatementarchive/2010/december/20101201prpreventioncommission Eminent world personalities call for an HIV Prevention Revolution] [[UNAIDS]], press release of 1 December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''SAFE-BioPharma Association''' is the non-profit association that created and manages the SAFE-BioPharma [[digital identity]] and [[digital signature]] standard for the global [[pharmaceutical]], [[biotech]] and [[healthcare]] industries. SAFE stands for "Signatures &amp; Authentication For Everyone" (but originally stood for "Secure Access For Everyone"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CSI page on SAFE describing original goal and name|url=http://www.csirochester.com/safe.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;).  It was originally created as an initiative of the [[Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America]] (PhRMA) association to encourage the use of a common digital identity and digital signature standard for the pharmaceutical industry, but is now an independent non-profit association offering such standards services to the government and the entire [[healthcare industry]].

The SAFE-BioPharma industry standard is used to establish and manage digital identities and to issue and apply digital signatures. It mitigates legal, regulatory and business risk associated with business-to-business and business-to-regulator electronic transactions. It also facilitates interoperability by providing a secure, enforceable, and regulatory-compliant way to verify identities of parties involved in electronic transactions.

SAFE-BioPharma’s vision is to be a catalyst in transforming the biopharmaceutical and healthcare communities to a fully electronic business environment by 2012.

== Certificate authority ==
The SAFE-BioPharma digital identity and signature standard operates one of the nation’s leading [[public key infrastructure]] (PKI) certificate authority bridges. These PKI certificate bridges establish an infrastructure for the trusted exchange of confidential information and the reliable authentication of identities over the Internet. By providing a highly secure way to validate, trust, and manage identities of unknown participants in an Internet transaction, the SAFE-BioPharma Bridge [[certificate authority|Certificate Authority]] (SBCA) is essential to helping achieve the speed, efficiency and cost-savings inherent in use of the Internet for business transactions. This technology also improves interoperability across many different systems.

== Cross-certification ==
The SAFE-BioPharma Bridge Certificate Authority is cross-certified with the [http://www.cio.gov/fpkia/ Federal Bridge Public Key Infrastructure Architecture] (FPKIA), facilitating the ability of SAFE-BioPharma member companies that meet certain security, technical and operational criteria to leverage the identity credentials of any and all bridge members in the exchange of sensitive and confidential information. In essence, it allows officials in [[Health and Human Services]], the [[Food and Drug Administration]], [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]], and other government agencies to trust the origins of electronic documents received from corporate managers, physicians, clinical researchers, etc. who are credentialed to digitally sign documents with SAFE-BioPharma digital signatures. Additionally, the identities are trusted for authentication access control for sites requiring strong authentication.

== Regulatory acceptance ==
SAFE-BioPharma has worked closely with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the [[European Medicines Agency]] (EMA) and other global healthcare and regulatory agencies to ensure the digital signatures generated using SAFE-BioPharma certificates meet regulatory requirements and are accepted by these agencies when used on documents that are part of electronic submissions. It thus allows voluminous paper documents used for regulatory compliance to be digitally signed and submitted in electronic form. This improves accuracy, reduces costs, enables electronic search and retrieval and saves energy and natural resources.

'''STARskaters.org''', a US Paralympic Sport Club, was founded by [[Sugar Land, Texas]] businessman Jim O'Neill in 2008.  The organization is composed of Houston area volunteers, many of whom are hockey players, skating instructors, figure skaters, coaches and officials.

==History==
The first version of the STARskaters website went live on May 1, 2008. The Maple Leaf Pub in Houston hosted the first fundraising event on July 26 of 2008, and the first skating event was held at the Willowbrook Aerodrome on August 2 of 2008.

The original concept was to hold quarterly STAR skates for organizations who provide services for individuals with disabilities, but the scope of the program quickly expanded to also include Sled Hockey.  On February 14, 2009, the first "Sled Hockey Weekend" was held to recruit players and raise the awareness of the sport in Houston.

The first STAR skate for ARC of Fort Bend County was held May 15, 2010 and was the first STARskaters event held at the Sugar Land Ice &amp; Sports Center. This event lead to the first special needs skating lessons which started  September 18, 2010.

The special needs skating lessons were noticed by B.L. Wylie, the Parent Education Coordinator for the U.S. Figure Skating instructional program at Sugar Land Ice &amp; Sports Center.  As the mother of Olympic Medalist [[Paul Wylie]] and a veteran instructor for U.S. Figure Skating, B.L. had always envisioned creating a skating program for individuals with disabilities.  In October 2010 she took over as Director of the program which is today known as SkateTherapy.org which has become a model program for rinks across the country for instruction of disabled skaters.

Today, between the STAR skates, SkateTherapy and Sled Hockey programs, outreach and community involvement, more than 130 events are held annually.

==Mission==
STARskaters mission is to provide an on-ice experience for individuals with disabilities through their STAR skates, SkateTherapy and Sled Hockey programs.

==Paralympic Sport Club status==
In June 2011, STARskaters was invited to apply for status as a US Paralympic Sport Club.

Sports clubs are community-based sports organizations developed to involve youth and adults with physical and visual disabilities in ongoing sports and physical activity, regardless of skill level.  They also serve as a pipeline to develop athletes for competition in the Paralympic games held every two years following the Olympic games.

After a review of the STARskaters program, Sport Club status was granted on July 21 of 2011. The first Paralympic Experience event was held at Ice Skate USA at Memorial City Mall on May 12, 2012 with Andy Yohe, Captain of the 2010 Gold Medal US Sled Hockey team participating in a "try Sled Hockey" event and providing instruction and skills and drills for players from Houston and Austin.

==Organization structure==
STARskaters is a [[501(c)|501(c)(3)]] non profit and 100% volunteer organization.  There is a board of directors which oversees all of the programs as well as advisory boards for both the Sled Hockey and SkateTherapy programs.

===Board of directors===
*Executive Director – Jim O'Neill
*Director, Skate Therapy – B.L. Wylie
*Director, Sled Hockey – Reid Williams
*Secretary – Lilia Quintana
*Treasurer - David Seto

==Program details==
'''STAR skates''' – Skating events held by request for organizations who service the disabled community.  Events are held at area rinks for schools, service organizations and area US Paralympic Sport Clubs and youth wheelchair summer camp events.

'''Sled Hockey''' – A Paralympic sport, Sled Hockey is played by the same rules as stand-up hockey but with players sitting in specially designed sleds.  They propel themselves with sticks which have picks on the end to dig into the ice.

'''SkateTherapy''' – A program designed to provide stand-up skating instruction for individuals with a broad range of physical and developmental disabilities.  The program follows the U.S. Figure Skating 14 level badge program, and the program, started in Sugar Land, TX has become a model for other program development around the United States.

===The Ice Cruiser and Jessie Chan===
Jessie Chan always waited for the opportunity to give back the gift and passion of skating to others.  In October 2013, at age 17, the opportunity presented itself in the form of a blind Skate Therapy student too terrified to take the ice, she had her chance.
 
5 months later, Jessie debuted her first original invention, the Ice Cruiser, a unique 360 degree walker that aids beginning skaters and those with physical and mental disabilities in learning how to skate independently. The multi-storied structure and all-around barrier design provides skaters with both the freedom and security to roam across the ice without the fear of loss of balance or direct collision with anyone or anything.
 
The power of the first Ice Cruiser can be demonstrated in Shoureek, that same blind skater who once struggled to even stand on the ice in only the arms of his instructors. Now, Shoureek spends his Saturdays happily and confidently gliding across Skate Therapy ice on his own, the comfort of his own Ice Cruiser assuring him of the power he himself has to transform and grow stronger.
  
Today, Jessie holds a provisional patent and has big plans for the Ice Cruiser. Recently, she got down to work with her dedicated team of SkateTherapy volunteers and constructed the first Small and Medium-sized Ice Cruisers to be donated to the Skate Therapy program.

===Kyle Huckaby===
When Kyle about 9, he started playing goalie in roller hockey, sitting on the floor playing against able-bodied players. This helped him begin to sharpen his hockey skills.  Later when an ECHL hockey team came to the Beaumont area, he played goalie at a few junior practices.   Again, sitting on the ice to play in goal against the able-bodied players.  Kyle finally got his first sled when some adult hockey players were able to get a local refinery to donate money to purchase a hockey sled.  However, he was only able to play in the sled a couple of times before the ECHL team left in 2008 and they no longer had ice.

Kyle didn't play hockey on ice again until he was introduced to STARskaters at the Metal &amp; Muscle Expo in Houston in the fall of 2011.  After that meeting Kyle and his family made the long drive from Beaumont to Houston every weekend where Kyle started the day on the ice with Sled Hockey, then on to Wheelchair Basketball and other activities.

In April 2012, STARskaters invited Kyle to play goalie in the USA Hockey Disabled Festival in Dallas.  It was the first National Tournament for STARskaters Sled Hockey team and Kyle did double duty, playing for both the Houston adult team and in the Junior division for a team from Minnesota.  His stellar performance in goal caught the eye of JJ O'Connor of USA Disabled Hockey.  Kyle was invited to the National Development Camp in New York, and subsequently was named to the USA National Development Sled Hockey team.

In addition to Sled Hockey Kyle played wheelchair basketball for TIRR Houston Hotwheels from 2010-2013, and won the 2013 NWBA Junior National Championship.  He currently plays wheelchair basketball for the University of Texas Arlington where he is majoring in journalism.
 
STARskaters is proud to have had a small part in Kyle's success but the real credit goes to Kyle's family for their support, dedication and countless hours on the road shuttling Kyle to his many sports activities.  And, of course, Kyle himself for the hard work and dedication that took him from sitting on the floor of a roller hockey league in Beaumont to competing at the highest level of the sport against teams from all over the world.

===USA Hockey Disabled Festival===
STARskaters Sled Hockey team first competed in the USA Hockey Disabled festival April  13-15th, 2012.  Players from Houston and Austin joined combined to win 3rd place in their first ever national competition.

In 2013 players from Houston and Dallas combined to participate in the Disabled Festival as the Texas STARS in Philadelphia, PA but failed to earn a medal.  In 2014 at the tournament in Boston, Mass, the team finished in second place.

In 2015 the team  went undefeated,  outscoring their opponents 33–2 and won the championship of the national division.

'''The Salpêtriére School''', also known as the '''School of Paris''', is, with the [[Nancy School]], one of the schools that contributed to the age of hypnosis in France from 1882 to 1892.  The leader of this school, the neurologist [[Jean Martin Charcot]], contributed to the rehabilitation of hypnosis as a scientific subject presenting it as a somatic expression of [[hysteria]].  Charcot also used hypnosis as an investigative method and that by putting his hysterical patients into an "experimental state" it would permit him to reproduce their symptoms and interpret them.

Charcot did not consider people suffering from hysteria as pretenders&lt;ref&gt;Léon Chertok et Isabelle Stengers, Le cœur et la raison. L'hypnose en question de Lavoisier à Lacan, Payot, 1989&lt;/ref&gt; and discovered that hysteria was not just a state reserved for women.&lt;ref&gt;Léon Chertok et Isabelle Stengers, Le cœur et la raison. L'hypnose en question de Lavoisier à Lacan, Payot, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;  Finally, Charcot associated hysteria to post-traumatic paralysis, establishing the basis for the theory of psychic trauma.

Charcot’s collaborators included [[Joseph Babinski]], [[Paul Richer]], [[Alfred Binet]], [[Charles Féré]], [[Pierre Janet]], [[Georges Gilles de la Tourette]], [[Alexandre-Achille Souques]], [[Jules Cotard]], [[Pierre Marie]], [[Gilbert Ballet]], [[Paul-Marie-Léon Regnard|Paul Regnard]], [[Désiré-Magloire Bourneville]], [[Paul Brémaud]] and [[Amédée Dumontpallier|Victor Dumontpallier]].{{cn|date=April 2018}}

Ultimately, Charcot was accused of operating as a carnival showman, training his patients in theatrical behaviour, which he would attribute to hypnosis.&lt;ref&gt;Isabelle Stengers, L'hypnose entre magie et science, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;  After his death in 1893, the practice of hypnotism declined in medical circles.&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Janet, La médecine psychologique, 1923&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical context==
'''Animal magnetism and the emergence of hypnosis'''
Detailed article:  [[Animal magnetism]]

Since the theoretical development of animal magnetism in 1773 by [[Franz Mesmer|Franz-Anton Mesmer]], the various movements of “magnetic medicine” fought into vain to be recognized and legitimized. In France, animal magnetism is introduced by Mesmer in 1778 and is the subject of several official condemnations, particularly in 1784, and in 1842 the Academy of Sciences decided to stop investigating magnetic phenomenon. That did not prevent a great number of doctors from using  it, particularly in hospitals, including
[[Charles Deslon]], [[Jules Germain Cloquet|Jules Cloquet]], [[Alexandre Jacques François Bertrand|Alexandre Bertrand]], Professor Husson, [[Leon Rostan]],&lt;ref&gt;Léon Rostan, « Magnétisme », ''Dictionnaire de médecine et de chirurgie pratique'', 1825, Vol. XIII.&lt;/ref&gt; [[François Broussais]], [[Étienne-Jean Georget]],&lt;ref&gt;Étienne-Jean Georget ''De la physiologie du système nerveux, et spécialement du cerveau'', Paris, 1821.&lt;/ref&gt; Didier Berna and [[Alphonse Teste]].&lt;ref&gt;Alphonse Teste, ''Manuel pratique de magnétisme animal'', 1843.&lt;/ref&gt; In other European countries, animal magnetism was not subject to such harsh judgment, and was practiced by doctors such [[David Ferdinand Koreff]], [[Christoph Wilhelm Hufeland]], Karl Alexander Ferdinand Kluge, Karl Christian Wolfart, Karl Schelling, [[Justinus Kerner]], [[James Esdaile]] and [[John Elliotson]].

The term “hypnotic” appears in  the Dictionary of the French Academy in 1814&lt;ref&gt;''Dictionnaire de l'Académie Française'', Tome I, p. 708; Tome II, p. 194.&lt;/ref&gt; and the terms “hypnotism”, “hypnosis”, “hypnoscope”, “hypnopole”, “hypnocratie”, “hypnoscopy”, “hypnomancie” and “hypnocritie” are proposed by [[Étienne Félix d'Henin de Cuvillers]] on the basis of the prefix “hypn” as of 1820.&lt;ref&gt;Étienne Félix d'Henin de Cuvillers, ''Le magnétisme éclairé ou Introduction aux « Archives du Magnétisme Animal »''&lt;/ref&gt; The Etymological dictionary of the French words drawn from the Greek, by Mr. Morin; second edition by Mr. Guinon, 2 volume - 8°, Paris, 1809, and the universal Dictionary of Boiste, include the expressions “hypnobate”, “hypnology”, “hypnologic”, “hypnotic”. But it is generally accepted that in the 1840s, it is that the Scottish surgeon [[James Braid (surgeon)|James Braid]] who makes the transition between animal magnetism and hypnosis. In 1841, Braid attends a public demonstration of the hypnotizer Charles Lafontaine and in 1843 he publishes ''Neurhypnology, Treaty of nervous sleep or hypnotism''. Braid’s hypothesis essentially repeats the doctrines of the French imaginationnist hypnotizers such Jose Custodio da Faria and Alexandre Bertrand. Braid however criticizes  Bertrand for explaining the magnetic phenomenon as caused by a  mental state, the power of imagination, whereas he explains them as being due to a physiological cause, the tiredness of the nerve centers related to a paralysis of the ocular apparatus.&lt;ref&gt;James Braid, ''Neurhypnologie, Traité du sommeil nerveux ou hypnotisme'', 1843, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

His contribution consists above all of proposing a new method of fascination based on concentrating  on a brilliant object, a  method that supposedly produces more constant and more rapid effects compared to that of the old-fashioned hypnotizers, and a theory based on the concept of mental fatigue. For him, hypnosis is a state of mental concentration during which the faculties of the patient’s spirit are so entirely monopolized by one idea that it becomes indifferent to any other considerations or influence. Braid uses this method as an anesthetic during surgery. At that time, [[ether]] was not yet used in anesthesiology. Discovered in 1818 by [[Michael Faraday]], ether is not used for the first time until 1846, by the American dentist [[William T. G. Morton|William Morton]].

Around 1848, [[Ambroise-Auguste Liébeault]], a young surgery intern, also became interested in animal magnetism. Influenced by the hypnotizers [[Charles Lafontaine]] and [[Baron du Potet|Jules Dupotet de Sennevoy]], he began putting young women to sleep.
On December 5, 1859, the surgeon [[Alfred-Armand-Louis-Marie Velpeau|Alfred Velpeau]] presented to [[Academy of Sciences]]  an intervention practised under hypnotic anaesthesia according to the method of Braid in the name of three young doctors, [[Étienne Eugène Azam]], [[Paul Broca]] and [[Eugene Follin]].&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Durand (de Gros), ''Le merveilleux scientifique'', 1894.&lt;/ref&gt; The previous day at Necker hospital the three operated on an anal tumor using hypnotic anaesthesia. The operation, very painful by nature, occurred without the patient showing any sign of pain. The following year, Joseph Durand (de Gros) published ''A theoretical and practical course of Braidisme, or nervous hypnotism''.

In 1864, Liébeault moved to  Nancy as a philanthropist healer, curing children with magnetized water and by the laying on of hands. His  interest in animal magnetism was revived by reading the works of Crêpe and Azam. He is on the fringe at a time when animal magnetism was completely discredited by the academy when he publishes in 1866, to general indifference, ''Sleep and similar states considered especially from the point of view of the action of the moral on the physique''.&lt;ref&gt;Ambroise-Auguste Liébeault, ''Du sommeil et des états analogues considérés surtout du point de vue de l'action du moral sur le physique'', Paris, Masson, 1866&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1870, the philosopher [[Hippolyte Taine]] presented  an introduction to the theories of Braid in his review ''Intelligence''. In 1880, a neurologist of Breslau, [[Rudolf Heidenhain]], impressed by the achievements of the public hypnotizer Carl Hansen, adopts his method and publishes a book on animal magnetism.&lt;ref&gt;{{de icon}} Rudolf Heidenhain, ''Der Sog thierische Magnetismus. physiologische Beobachtungen'', Leipzig, 1880&lt;/ref&gt; In Austria, the neurologist [[Moritz Benedikt]] experiments with hypnosis,&lt;ref&gt;Henri F. Ellenberger, ''Histoire de la découverte de l'inconscient'', 1970, p. 765&lt;/ref&gt; followed by the doctor [[Josef Breuer]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16735">In the social sciences, '''scaling''' is the process of [[measurement|measuring]] or ordering entities with respect to quantitative attributes or traits. For example, a scaling technique might involve estimating individuals' levels of extraversion, or the perceived quality of products. Certain methods of scaling permit estimation of magnitudes on a [[Continuum (theory)|continuum]], while other methods provide only for relative ordering of the entities.

The [[level of measurement]] is the type of data that is measured.

The word scale is sometimes (including in academic literature) used to refer to another [[composite measure]], that of an [[Index (statistics)|index]]. Those concepts are however different.&lt;ref name="Babbie2012-162"&gt;{{cite book|author=Earl Babbie|title=The Practice of Social Research|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k-aza3qSULoC&amp;pg=PA162|date=1 January 2012|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=1-133-04979-6|page=162}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scale construction decisions==
*What level of data is involved (nominal, ordinal, interval, or ratio)?
*What will the results be used for?
*Should you use a scale, index, or typology?
*What types of statistical analysis would be useful?
*Should you use a comparative scale or a noncomparative scale?
*How many scale divisions or categories should be used (1 to 10; 1 to 7; &amp;minus;3 to +3)?
*Should there be an odd or even number of divisions? (Odd gives neutral center value; even forces respondents to take a non-neutral position.)
*What should the nature and descriptiveness of the scale labels be?
*What should the physical form or layout of the scale be? (graphic, simple linear, vertical, horizontal)
*Should a response be forced or be left optional?

==Scale construction method==
It is possible that something similar to your scale will already exist, so including those scale(s) and possible dependent variables in your survey may increase [[Validity (statistics)|validity]] of your scale.

#Begin by generating at least ten items to represent each of the scales. Administer the survey; the more representative and larger your sample, the more [[Confidence interval|confidence]] you will have in your scales.
#Review the [[Mean|means]] and [[Standard deviation|standard deviations]] for your items, dropping any items with skewed means or very low variance.
#Run a [[Principal component analysis|principal components analysis]] with oblique rotation on your items and the other items for scales it will be important to differentiate from your own. Request components with [[Eigenvalues and eigenvectors|eigenvalues]] greater than 1. It is easier if you group the items by targeted scales. The more distinct the other items, the better your chances your items will load only on your own scale.
#“Cleanly loaded items” are those that [[Factor analysis|load]] at least .40 on one component and more than .10 greater on that component than on any others. Identify those.
#“Cross loaded items” are those that do not meet the above criterion. These are candidates to drop.
#Identify components with only a few items that do not represent clear concepts, these are “uninterpretable scales.” Also identify any components with only one item. These components and their items are candidates to drop.
#Look at the candidates to drop and the components to be dropped. Is there anything that needs to be retained because it is critical to your [[Construct (philosophy)|construct]] ? For example, if a conceptually important item only cross loads on a component to be dropped, it is good to keep it for the next round.
#Drop the items, and rerun asking the program to give you only the number of components after dropping the uninterpretable and single-item ones. Go through the process again starting at Step 3.
#Keep running through the process until you get “clean factors” (all components have cleanly loaded items).
#Run the [[Cronbach's alpha|Alpha]] program (asking for the Alphas if each item is dropped). Any scales with insufficient Alphas should be dropped and the process repeated from Step 3.
#For better practices, keep the final components and all loadings of yours and similar scales selected to be used in the Appendix of your scale.

==Data types==
{{main|Level of measurement}}
The type of information collected can influence scale construction. Different types of information are measured in different ways.  
#Some data are measured at the '''[[level of measurement#Nominal level|nominal level]]'''. That is, any numbers used are mere labels; they express no mathematical properties. Examples are SKU inventory codes and UPC bar codes.
#Some data are measured at the '''[[level of measurement#Ordinal scale|ordinal level]]'''. Numbers indicate the relative position of items, but not the magnitude of difference. An example is a preference ranking.
#Some data are measured at the '''[[level of measurement#Interval scale|interval level]]'''. Numbers indicate the magnitude of difference between items, but there is no absolute zero point. Examples are attitude scales and opinion scales.
#Some data are measured at the '''[[level of measurement#Ratio scale|ratio level]]'''. Numbers indicate magnitude of difference and there is a fixed zero point. Ratios can be calculated. Examples include: age, income, price, costs, sales revenue, sales volume, and market share.

==Composite measures==
[[Composite measure]]s of variables are created by combining two or more separate [[empirical]] indicators into a single measure. Composite measures measure complex concepts more adequately than single indicators, extend the range of scores available and are more efficient at handling multiple items.

In addition to scales, there are two other types of composite measures. [[Index (statistics)|Indexes]] are similar to scales except multiple indicators of a variable are combined into a single measure. The index of consumer confidence, for example, is a combination of several measures of consumer attitudes. A [[typology (statistics)|typology]] is similar to an index except the variable is measured at the [[Nominal measurement#Nominal scale|nominal level]].

Indexes are constructed by accumulating scores assigned to individual attributes, while scales are constructed through the assignment of scores to patterns of attributes.

While indexes and scales provide measures of a single [[dimension]], typologies are often employed to examine the intersection of two or more dimensions. Typologies are very useful analytical tools and can be easily used as [[independent variable]]s, although since they are not unidimensional it is difficult to use them as a [[dependent variable]].

== Comparative and non comparative scaling ==

With [[comparative scaling]], the items are directly compared with each other (example: Do you prefer [[Pepsi]] or [[Coca-Cola|Coke]]?). In [[noncomparative scaling]] each item is scaled independently of the others (example: How do you feel about Coke?).

==Comparative scaling techniques==
*[[Pairwise comparison]] scale – a respondent is presented with two items at a time and asked to select one (example : Do you prefer Pepsi or Coke?). This is an ordinal level technique when a measurement model is not applied. Krus and Kennedy (1977) elaborated the paired comparison scaling within their domain-referenced model. The [[Bradley–Terry model|Bradley–Terry–Luce (BTL) model]] (Bradley and Terry, 1952; Luce, 1959) can be applied in order to derive measurements provided the data derived from paired comparisons possess an appropriate structure. Thurstone's [[Law of comparative judgment]] can also be applied in such contexts.
*[[Rasch model]] scaling – respondents interact with items and comparisons are inferred between items from the responses to obtain scale values. Respondents are subsequently also scaled based on their responses to items given the item scale values. The Rasch model has a close relation to the BTL model.
*'''[[Ranking|Rank-ordering]]''' – a respondent is presented with several items simultaneously and asked to rank them (example : Rate the following advertisements from 1 to 10.). This is an ordinal level technique.
*'''[[Bogardus social distance scale]]''' – measures the degree to which a person is willing to associate with a class or type of people. It asks how willing the respondent is to make various associations. The results are reduced to a single score on a scale. There are also non-comparative versions of this scale.
*'''[[Q methodology|Q-Sort]]''' – Up to 140 items are sorted into groups based on rank-order procedure.
*'''[[Guttman scale]]''' – This is a procedure to determine whether a set of items can be rank-ordered on a unidimensional scale. It utilizes the intensity structure among several indicators of a given variable. Statements are listed in order of importance. The rating is scaled by summing all responses until the first negative response in the list. The Guttman scale is related to Rasch measurement; specifically, Rasch models bring the Guttman approach within a probabilistic framework.
*'''[[Constant sum scale]]''' – a respondent is given a constant sum of money, script, credits, or points and asked to allocate these to various items (example : If you had 100 Yen to spend on food products, how much would you spend on product A, on product B, on product C, etc.). This is an ordinal level technique.
*'''[[Magnitude estimation scale]]''' – In a [[psychophysics]] procedure invented by [[Stanley Smith Stevens|S. S. Stevens]] people simply assign numbers to the dimension of judgment.  The geometric mean of those numbers usually produces a [[power law]] with a characteristic exponent.  In [[cross-modality matching]] instead of assigning numbers, people manipulate another dimension, such as loudness or brightness to match the items.  Typically the exponent of the psychometric function can be predicted from the magnitude estimation exponents of each dimension.

==Non-comparative scaling techniques==
*'''[[Visual analogue scale]]''' (also called the [[Continuous rating scale]] and the graphic rating scale) – respondents rate items by placing a mark on a line. The line is usually labeled at each end. There are sometimes a series of numbers, called scale points, (say, from zero to 100) under the line. Scoring and codification is difficult for paper-and-pencil scales, but not for computerized and Internet-based visual analogue scales.&lt;ref name="Reips Funke"&gt;U.-D. Reips and F. Funke (2008) "Interval level measurement with visual analogue scales in Internet-based research: VAS Generator." {{doi|10.3758/BRM.40.3.699}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[Likert scale]]''' – Respondents are asked to indicate the amount of agreement or disagreement (from strongly agree to strongly disagree) on a five- to nine-point response scale (not to be confused with a Likert scale). The same format is used for multiple questions. It is the combination of these questions that forms the Likert scale.  This categorical scaling procedure can easily be extended to a [[magnitude estimation]] procedure that uses the full scale of numbers rather than verbal categories.
*'''[[Phrase completions|Phrase completion scales]]''' – Respondents are asked to complete a phrase on an 11-point response scale in which 0 represents the absence of the theoretical construct and 10 represents the theorized maximum amount of the construct being measured. The same basic format is used for multiple questions.
*'''[[Semantic differential scale]]''' – Respondents are asked to rate on a 7-point scale an item on various attributes. Each attribute requires a scale with bipolar terminal labels.
*'''[[Stapel scale]]''' – This is a unipolar ten-point rating scale. It ranges from +5 to &amp;minus;5 and has no neutral zero point.
*'''[[Thurstone scale]]''' – This is a scaling technique that incorporates the intensity structure among indicators.
*'''[[Mathematically derived scale]]''' – Researchers infer respondents’ evaluations mathematically. Two examples are [[multi dimensional scaling (in marketing)|multi dimensional scaling]] and [[conjoint analysis (in marketing)|conjoint analysis]].

==Scale evaluation==
Scales should be tested for [[reliability (psychometric)|reliability]], generalizability, and [[validity (psychometric)|validity]]. Generalizability is the ability to make inferences from a sample to the population, given the scale you have selected. Reliability is the extent to which a scale will produce consistent results. Test-retest reliability checks how similar the results are if the research is repeated under similar circumstances. Alternative forms reliability checks how similar the results are if the research is repeated using different forms of the scale. Internal consistency reliability checks how well the individual measures included in the scale are converted into a composite measure.

Scales and indexes have to be validated. Internal validation checks the relation between the individual measures included in the scale, and the composite scale itself. External validation checks the relation between the composite scale and other indicators of the variable, indicators not included in the scale. Content validation (also called face validity) checks how well the scale measures what is supposed to measured. Criterion validation checks how meaningful the scale criteria are relative to other possible criteria. Construct validation checks what underlying construct is being measured. There are three variants of [[construct validity]]. They are [[convergent validity]], [[discriminant validity]], and [[nomological validity]] (Campbell and Fiske, 1959; Krus and Ney, 1978). The coefficient of reproducibility indicates how well the data from the individual measures included in the scale can be reconstructed from the composite scale.

'''Shock chlorination''' is a process used in many swimming pools, [[water well]]s, [[spring (hydrosphere)|springs]], and other water sources to reduce the [[bacteria]]l and [[algae|algal]] residue in the water. Shock chlorination is performed by mixing a large amount of [[sodium hypochlorite]], which can be in the form of a powder or a liquid such as [[chlorine bleach]], into the water. The common advice is that the amount added must raise the level of chlorine to 10X the level (in parts per million) of [[chloramines]] present in the pool water-this is "shocking". A lesser ratio is superchlorinating.&lt;ref name="Shocking or Super-Chlorinating"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://blog.poolcenter.com/article.aspx?articleid=6165 | title=Shocking or Super-Chlorinating your swimming pool | publisher=Poolcenter.com | work=Pool Care &amp; Repair Blog | date=January 14, 2011 | accessdate=September 3, 2017 | author=Cox, Rob}}&lt;/ref&gt; Water that is being shock chlorinated should not be swum in or drunk until the sodium hypochlorite count in the water goes down to three [[parts per million|ppm]] or less. Commercial [[sodium hypochlorite]] should not be mixed with commercial [[calcium hypochlorite]], as there is a risk of explosion.{{cn|date=April 2018}} Although a verb for '''superchlorination''',&lt;ref name="Superchlorinating Best Way?"/&gt; "shock" is often misunderstood (through marketing and sales language) to be a unique type of product.

== Drawbacks ==
While "shocking" pools to reduce the buildup of [[chloramines]] works with inorganic, ammonia-based chloramines, in two studies it was found ineffective with the organic chloramines present in all pool water e.g. with [[creatinine]], an organic component in [[human sweat]]. Indeed, superchlorination produces free chlorine that reacts with organic contaminants to form a variety of [[disinfection byproducts]] (DBPs) which are hazardous to swimmer health e.g. one of the worst DBPs is the noxious and volatile [[trichloramine]] (NCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), well known for irritating the eyes nearby a pool. It has been pointed out that [[ozone]] is an excellent alternative, a much more effective oxidizer than chlorine shock.&lt;ref name="Superchlorinating Best Way?"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://aquamagazine.com/service/is-superchlorinating-the-best-way-to-eliminate-chloramines.html | title=Is Superchlorinating The Best Way To Eliminate Chloramines? | work=AQUA Magazine | date=May 2011 | accessdate=September 3, 2017 | author=Webb, Scott}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Shushtar Historical Hydraulic System''', ({{lang-fa|سازه‌های آبی شوشتر}}) is an island city from the [[Sassanid]] era with a complex irrigation system. Located in [[Iran]]'s [[Khuzestan Province]].&lt;ref name=presstv /&gt;&lt;ref name=heritage&gt;[http://www.worldheritagesite.org/sites/shushtar.html Shushtar] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100604025444/http://www.worldheritagesite.org/sites/shushtar.html |date=2010-06-04 }}, world heritage sites, retrieved on May 1, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; It was registered on [[UNESCO]]'s list of [[World Heritage Sites]] in 2009 and is Iran's 10th cultural heritage site to be registered on the [[United Nations]]' list.&lt;ref name=presstv /&gt;&lt;ref name=unesco /&gt;

Shushtar infrastructure included [[water mills]], dams, tunnels, and canals. [[GarGar]] [[weir]] was built on the watermills and waterfalls. [[Bolayti canal]] is situated on the eastern side of the water mills and water falls and the functions to supply water from behind the GarGar bridge to the east side of water mills and the channel the water of river in order to prevent the damage to the water mills. [[Dahaneye shahr tunnel]] (city orifice) is one of the three main tunnels which channeled the water from behind the GarGar weir into the water mill and then run several water mills. [[Seh koreh]] canal channels the water from behind the GarGar bridge into the western side. In [[water mills]] and water falls, there are noticeable mills we can see a perfect model of haltering to run mills.&lt;ref name=presstv /&gt;&lt;ref name=unesco /&gt;

The [[Band-e Kaisar]] ("[[Caesar (title)|Caesar's]] dam"), an approximately {{convert|500|m|ft|adj=on}} long [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[weir]] across the [[Karun]], was the key structure of the complex which, along with the [[Band-i-Mizan]], retained and diverted river water into the irrigation canals in the area.&lt;ref&gt;Length: {{harvnb|Hodge|1992|p=85}}; {{harvnb|Hodge|2000|pp=337f.}}; extensive irrigation system: {{harvnb|O'Connor|1993|p=130}}&lt;/ref&gt; Built by a [[Roman Empire|Roman]] workforce in the 3rd&amp;nbsp;century&amp;nbsp;AD on Sassanid order,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|1971|pp=56–61}}; {{harvnb|Schnitter|1978|p=32}}; {{harvnb|Kleiss|1983|p=106}}; {{harvnb|Vogel|1987|p=50}}; {{harvnb|Hartung|Kuros|1987|p=232}}; {{harvnb|Hodge|1992|p=85}}; {{harvnb|O'Connor|1993|p=130}}; {{harvnb|Huff|2010}}; {{harvnb|Kramers|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was the most eastern [[Roman bridge]] and [[Roman dam]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schnitter|1978|p=28, fig. 7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the first structure in Iran to combine a bridge with a [[dam]].&lt;ref name="Vogel 1987, 50"&gt;{{harvnb|Vogel|1987|p=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Parts of the irrigation system are said to originally date to the time of [[Darius the Great]], an [[Achaemenian]] king of [[Iran]]. It partly consists of a pair of primary diversion canals in the Karun river, one of which is still in use today. It delivers water to the [[Shushtar]] city via a route of supplying tunnels.&lt;ref name=presstv&gt;[http://www.presstv.ir/detail.aspx?id=99268&amp;sectionid=351020108 UNESCO registers Iran's Shushtar water system], [[PressTV]], Retrieved on May 1, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The area includes Salasel Castel, which is the axis for operation of the hydraulic system. It also consists of a tower for water level measurement, along with bridges, dams, mills, and basins.&lt;ref name=presstv /&gt;&lt;ref name=unesco /&gt; 

Then it enters the plain south from the city, where its impact includes enabling the possibility of farming over the area called Mianâb and planting [[orchard]]s.&lt;ref name=unesco&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1315 Shushtar Historical Hydraulic System], [[UNESCO]], Retrieved on May 1, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact the whole area between the two diversion canals (Shutayt and Gargar) on [[Karun|Karun river]] is called Mianâb, an island having the [[Shushtar]] city at its northern end.&lt;ref&gt;C. J. Edmonds, East and West of Zagros, BRILL, 2009, {{ISBN|9004173447}}; Page 157.&lt;/ref&gt;

The site has been referred to as "a masterpiece of creative genius" by [[UNESCO]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.in.msn.com/business/forbes/article.aspx?cp-documentid=3403037&amp;page=7 Check out 13 emerging wonders of the world], msn news, Retrieved on May 1, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Soylent''' is a brand of [[meal replacement]] products available in the U.S., named after an artificial food in the science-fiction novel ''[[Make Room! Make Room!]]'' Soylent was introduced in 2014 after a [[crowdfunding]] campaign that generated nearly $1.5 million in preorders.&lt;ref name=Infusion/&gt;

Its producer, Rosa Foods, says that Soylent meets all [[nutritional requirements]] for an average adult.&lt;ref name="Scutti"/&gt; Initial recipes were first created and tested by software engineer Rob Rhinehart&lt;ref name="SYSK"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.stuffyoushouldknow.com/podcasts/soylent.htm|title=How Soylent Works|last=|first=|date=2017-01-19|work=|newspaper=[[Stuff You Should Know]]|language=en|access-date=2017-01-27|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a self-experiment in nutrition. Subsequently, the powdered version of Soylent was developed into the first product line of Rosa Foods, which currently markets and sells the product. For about two months in late 2016, the company also marketed a solid-form meal bar under the brand name as well, but it was discontinued after reports that it caused gastrointestinal problems for some consumers. Sales of the powdered version were also halted briefly in late 2016 before the product was reformulated and its sales resumed.

Rosa Foods says that the current formulation is based on recommendations of the [[National Academy of Medicine]].&lt;ref name="soylent-faq-nutrition"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://faq.soylent.com/hc/en-us/articles/212768183-Nutrition|title=Nutrition|website=Rosa Foods|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They established an [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] [[nutrition facts label]] and said the product meets the criteria for some health-related claims.&lt;ref name=GetsTested&gt;{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2014/01/soylent-gets-tested-scores-a-surprisingly-wholesome-nutritional-label/|title=Soylent gets tested, scores a surprisingly wholesome nutritional label|first=Lee|last=Hutchinson|work=Ars Technica|date=29 January 2014|accessdate=2015-06-11|quote=However, the results of the nutrition testing done to gain the label have established that Soylent meets the Food and Drug Administration's standards for a whole raft of healthy claims: "Everything from reduced risk of heart disease and some cancers to absence of tooth decay," said Rhinehart.

== History ==
===Origin===
[[File:Soylent drink.jpg|thumb|A Soylent package, along with the powder and resulting drink]]
Soylent began as a 30-day self-experiment in nutrition. In January 2013, software engineer Rob Rhinehart purchased 35 ingredients, most in raw chemical form, which he had concluded based on reading nutritional biochemistry textbooks and U.S. government web sites were every substance that the body needs to survive.&lt;ref name="blog298"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://robrhinehart.com/?p=298 | title=How I Stopped Eating Food | date=February 13, 2013 | accessdate=2015-04-04 | website=Rob Rhinehart personal blog}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Widdicombe"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/05/12/the-end-of-food | title=The End of Food | work=The New Yorker | date=May 12, 2014 | accessdate=February 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rhinehart, working at a start-up, had come to view food as a time-consuming hassle, and resolved to treat food as an engineering problem.&lt;ref name=Widdicombe/&gt; The ingredients included potassium gluconate to get potassium (since pure potassium is too highly reactive to consume), calcium carbonate for calcium, monosodium phosphate for phosphorus, oligosaccharides such as maltodextrin for carbohydrates, and olive oil for fatty acids.&lt;ref name="blog424"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://robrhinehart.com/?p=424 | title=What's in Soylent | date=February 14, 2013 | accessdate=2015-04-04 | website=Rob Rhinehart personal blog | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150330072737/http://robrhinehart.com/?p=424 | archivedate=March 30, 2015 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=blog298/&gt; With some trepidation, he poured the chemicals into a blender, added water, and drank the mixture.&lt;ref name=Widdicombe/&gt;&lt;ref name=Storr/&gt; It tasted sweet, like cake mix.&lt;ref name="Storr"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/active/10032594/The-man-who-lives-without-food.html | title=The man who lives without food | work=The Telegraph | date=May 6, 2013 | accessdate=2013-05-13 | author=Storr, Will | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Consuming nothing but Soylent for the next 30 days and measuring his results, Rhinehart claims that his energy levels skyrocketed, his skin improved, prolonged mental concentration was less fatiguing, and he was able to run farther than he ever had before.&lt;ref name=blog298/&gt; He adjusted proportions to counter problems such as a racing heart and an iron deficiency.&lt;ref name=blog298/&gt;&lt;ref name=Storr/&gt; Previously, Rhinehart had spent about two hours a day making food, eating food, and cleaning up afterward. He got Soylent preparation time down to 5&amp;nbsp;minutes in the evening, plus a few seconds to drink each "meal" the next day.&lt;ref name=blog298/&gt;

Over the next two months, Rhinehart lived mostly on Soylent, identifying and correcting further problems, and continued to refine the formula. One change was to use oat powder instead of maltodextrin: the original formula had no fiber.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.popsci.com/science/article/2013-07/could-liquid-replace-food | title=Could This Liquid Replace Food? | work=Popular Science | date=July 18, 2013 | accessdate=February 9, 2018 | author=Hannan, Caleb}}&lt;/ref&gt; His monthly food bill fell from about US$470 to US$50, and Soylent gave him full visibility and control over his nutrition, enabling him to fine-tune his intake of any nutrient at will.&lt;ref name=blog298/&gt;

=== Naming ===
Soylent is named after a food in [[Harry Harrison (writer)|Harry Harrison]]'s 1966 [[science fiction]] [[novel]] ''[[Make Room! Make Room!]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://faq.soylent.com/hc/en-us/articles/201541809-Why-is-it-named-Soylent- | title=Why is it named Soylent? | publisher=Rosa Foods, Inc. | accessdate=February 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Varughese /&gt; In the novel, most types of ''soylent'' are made from [[soya bean|soya]] and [[lentil]]s. The word also evokes the 1973 film adaptation ''[[Soylent Green]]'', in which the eponymous food is made from human remains.&lt;ref name=Widdicombe/&gt; Rhinehart also says he chose the name, with its morbid associations, to pique curiosity and deeper investigation, since the name was clearly not chosen with a traditionally "flashy" marketing scheme in mind.&lt;ref name=HutchDoesSoylent/&gt;

===DIY community===
In 2013, a community of people interested in making their own Soylent emerged online, attracted by the ability to customize nutrition precisely to each person's unique needs.&lt;ref name="Williams"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.wired.co.uk/article/make-diy-soylent | title=How to make your own DIY Soylent food | work=Wired | date=May 7, 2014 | accessdate=February 9, 2018 | author=Williams, Helena}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another software engineer, Nick Poulden, founded the web site diy.soylent.me (now www.completefoods.co), where users shared the results of their own tinkering with the Soylent recipe.&lt;ref name=Widdicombe/&gt;&lt;ref name="Robertson"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theverge.com/2013/9/27/4776560/the-world-of-diy-soylent-production | title=DIY Soylent: upstart nutritionists fight the tyranny of food | work=The Verge | date=Sep 27, 2013 | accessdate=February 9, 2018 | author=Robertson, Adi}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Williams/&gt; Users could enter a nutritional profile and select a recipe, and the web site would calculate exact proportions of each ingredient to yield the desired intake of each nutrient.&lt;ref name=Widdicombe/&gt; Zach Alexander, a former professional cook, made a Soylent formula mostly from ingredients available at grocery stores rather than laboratory supply houses, which he calls Hackerschool Soylent.&lt;ref name=Robertson/&gt;

===A commercial venture===
Rhinehart's blog posts about his experiment attracted attention on [[Hacker News]],&lt;ref name="Johnson"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.thedieline.com/blog/2017/2/27/the-fascinating-start-to-future-food-brand-soylent-part-2 | title=The Fascinating Start to Future Food Brand Soylent | work=The Dieline | date=March 14, 2017 | accessdate=February 9, 2018 | author=Johnson, Theresa Christine}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Widdicombe/&gt; eventually leading to a [[crowdfunding]] campaign on [[Tilt.com|Tilt]] that raised about $1.5 million in preorders&lt;ref name=Infusion&gt;{{cite web |url=https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2013/10/soylent-gets-a-1-5-million-infusion-of-venture-capital/ |title=Soylent gets a $1.5 million infusion of venture capital |first=Lee |last=Hutchinson |work=[[Ars Technica]] |date=October 21, 2013 |accessdate=2017-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Darling/&gt; aimed at moving the powdered drink from concept into production. It became one of the [[List of highest funded crowdfunding projects|most funded crowdfunding projects]] ever accomplished. After the campaign, Soylent had [[venture capital financing]] for a seed round of $1.5 million&lt;ref name=Darling&gt;[https://www.crowdfundinsider.com/2013/10/24870-crowdfunding-darling-soylent-nets-1-5-million-vc-funding/ Crowdfunding Darling Soylent Nets $1.5 Million In VC Funding]. October 22, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; to further develop [[proof of concept]]. Media reports detailed how operations began for Rosa Foods in April 2014, using a relatively small $500 system to ship the first $2.6 million worth of product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://medium.com/@alando46/how-we-spent-500-on-tech-to-ship-2-6m-of-soylent-3abfdcebee78|title=How We Spent $500 on Tech to Ship $2.6M of Soylent|date=June 3, 2015|first=Alando|last=Ballantyne|work=[[Medium (website)|Medium.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2015, Soylent received $20 million in [[Series A round]] funding, led by venture capital firm [[Andreessen Horowitz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://robrhinehart.com/?p=1192 |title=Soylent Raises Money |website=Rob Rhinehart personal blog |date=January 14, 2015 |accessdate=2015-01-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150121163816/http://robrhinehart.com/?p=1192 |archivedate=January 21, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to June 2015, Soylent was only available for purchase and shipment to people in the U.S. On June 15, 2015, the shipping of Soylent to [[Canada]] was introduced&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.soylent.com/post/121573571522/now-shipping-to-canada|title=Soylent: Now Shipping to Canada|date=June 15, 2015|website=Soylent Blog}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the same price in U.S. dollars as for U.S. customers. Expansion to [[European countries]] is a stated future goal. In October 2017, Canada disallowed further shipments of Soylent due to a failure to meet Canadian food regulations on meal replacements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Meal replacement company Soylent has imports blocked in Canada|first=Maija|last=Kappler|date=October 25, 2017|url=https://www.ctvnews.ca/business/meal-replacement-company-soylent-has-imports-blocked-in-canada-1.3648234|work=[[CTV News]]|location=Toronto|accessdate=October 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2017, Soylent was sold offline for the first time at [[7-Eleven]] stores around [[Los Angeles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/11/15951852/7-eleven-soylent-offline-sale-meal-in-bottle |title=Soylent is being sold offline for the first time|publisher=The Verge|accessdate=2017-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; By April 2018, Soylent was sold in over 8,000 7-Elevens around the country and it is planned to be sold in [[Walmart]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fortune.com/2018/04/11/soylent-meal-replacement-drinks-walmart/|title=Soylent Meal Replacement Drinks Are Coming to Walmart|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Soylent Bar===
Soylent Bar was Soylent in the form of a solid, edible bar. It was discontinued in October 2016 after reports of gastrointestinal problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.soylent.com/post/151720602057/update-on-soylent-bar |title=Update on Soylent Bar|date=October 12, 2016|website=Soylent official website}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health effects==
The makers of Soylent say it contains all the nutritional requirements necessary for a healthy lifestyle.&lt;ref name=GetsTested/&gt; There may be social drawbacks of living on a Soylent-only diet, since some critics have said that it comes at the expense of the pleasures from eating and sharing food.&lt;ref name=verge/&gt;

Some people have experienced gastrointestinal symptoms from consumption of Soylent.&lt;ref name=Manjoo/&gt;&lt;ref name=verge/&gt; Speculation on the cause of such symptoms sometimes centered around the amount of [[dietary fiber]] contained in the product which is known to cause such symptoms when diets are abruptly altered to increase amounts of fiber consumption. Later versions of the product lowered the amount of fiber content, but this did not stop the reports of gastrointestinal problems. The lower fiber content of the product led to additional criticisms of not containing an adequate amount, compared to daily recommendations, leading some to utilize fiber supplementation.

In October 2016, Rosa Foods recalled Soylent Bars due to reports of gastrointestinal symptoms, including [[nausea]], [[vomit]]ing, and [[diarrhea]].&lt;ref name="bars_halt"/&gt; The company is reported to have actively researched the issue with an independent party and suspected [[soy]] or [[sucralose]] [[food intolerance|intolerance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mole|first1=Beth|url=https://arstechnica.com/science/2016/10/reports-of-violent-vomiting-diarrhea-from-bars-has-soylent-on-the-defense/|title=People get "violently ill" from Soylent bars; company stumped|accessdate=13 October 2016|publisher=Ars Technica|date=12 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the company later concluded that algal flour was the cause after reviewing similar reports on Soylent 1.6 (powder), and was reformulating products to remove it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mole|first1=Beth|title=Solved: Algal flour was causing violent illnesses, Soylent says|url=https://arstechnica.com/science/2016/11/solved-algal-flour-was-causing-violent-illnesses-soylent-says/|accessdate=8 November 2016|publisher=Ars Technica|date=8 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company halted the sales of Soylent 1.6 after concluding so.&lt;ref name="bloomberg-blame-algae"&gt;{{cite web|title=Soylent Thinks It Found What Was Making People Sick: Algae|date=November 7, 2016|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-11-07/soylent-thinks-it-found-what-was-making-people-sick-algae|website=Bloomberg Technology|accessdate=17 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[TerraVia]], the supplier of Soylent's algal ingredients, published a fact sheet in response to media coverage for its algal flour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Facts about recent media coverage on algal flour|date=November 8, 2016|url=https://terravia.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/161108_FACTS_ABOUT_RECENT_MEDIA_COVERAGE_ON_ALGAL_FLOUR.pdf|website=TerraVia|accessdate=17 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2016, Soylent released a new iteration of its powdered formula, Soylent 1.7, which no longer contains algal flour.&lt;ref name="soylent-blog-1.7"/&gt;

As of October 24, 2017, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) is blocking sales of Soylent from Canada on the premise that the label on Soylent does not meet the CFIA requirements to be listed as a meal replacement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://money.cnn.com/2017/10/24/news/soylent-canada-ban/index.html|title=Soylent meal replacement is banned in Canada|first=Danielle|last=Wiener-Bronner|website=[[CNNMoney]]|date=October 24, 2017|accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shipping Soylent to Canada has been blocked by the CFIA until Rosa Foods makes changes to its products; Canadian shipments first began in June 2015.

===Lead and cadmium content===
[[File:Soylent_Proposition_65_Graphic.png|thumb|right|Comparison from the Soylent FAQ&lt;ref name=soylentprop65/&gt; on Proposition 65 chemicals in Soylent versus other foods.]]

On August 13, 2015, nonprofit environmental and corporate social responsibility watchdog [[As You Sow]] filed a notice of intent to pursue a lawsuit against the makers of Soylent, claiming that Soylent did not adequately label its product given the levels of [[lead]] and [[cadmium]] present in the drink. The basis for the lawsuit lies in California's [[California Proposition 65 (1986)|Proposition 65]], a law that requires additional labeling for food products containing trace amounts of certain substances.

Although Soylent contains levels of lead and cadmium far below the national safety levels set by the FDA, it does contain 12 to 25 times the level of lead and 4 times the level of cadmium allowable in a product without additional labeling as specified by Proposition 65.&lt;ref name=eater/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/as-you-sow-files-notice-of-legal-action-against-soylent-super-food-300128427.html|website=PR News Wire|date=13 August 2015|title=As You Sow Files Notice Of Legal Action Against Soylent Super Food}}&lt;/ref&gt; A lawyer who has worked on settlements of Proposition 65 suits described the case as "alarmist", as the levels are well below FDA limits of what is allowed in food products.&lt;ref name=foodnav/&gt; However, as Soylent is marketed as a complete meal replacement, many customers consume the drinks three times a day, equating to 36 to 75 times the lead and 12 times the level of cadmium without the Prop 65 label.&lt;ref name="Westervelt"&gt;{{cite news|title=Heavy metals prove all too common in meal replacement products, says watchdog group|first=Amy|last=Westervelt|date=August 18, 2015|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2015/aug/18/soylent-fda-heavy-metals-silicon-valley-as-you-sow|work=[[The Guardian]]|location=London|accessdate=October 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As You Sow believes these levels may be harmful.&lt;ref name=eater&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.eater.com/2015/8/16/9162301/soylent-as-you-sow-cadmium-lead-california|title=Soylent Under Fire For Allegedly Failing to Provide Adequate Warnings On Its Labels|first=Brenna|last=Houck|work=Eater|date=16 August 2015|accessdate=16 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lead is a [[neurotoxin]] that accumulates in soft tissues and bones, and even at low levels is linked to nerve damage, lower IQ, and reproductive problems including decreased sperm count. Cadmium is also a toxic heavy metal and has been linked to kidney, liver, and bone damage.&lt;ref name=Westervelt/&gt;

Soylent's website displays the Proposition 65 warning required by California.&lt;ref name=foodnav&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.foodnavigator-usa.com/Manufacturers/Soylent-hits-back-at-legal-threat-We-display-Prop-65-warnings|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150816004850/http://www.foodnavigator-usa.com/Manufacturers/Soylent-hits-back-at-legal-threat-We-display-Prop-65-warnings|archive-date=16 August 2015|title=Soylent case reignites debate over Prop 65: 'It's basically extortion,' claims attorney|first=Elaine|last=Watson|date=17 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rosa Foods published the position that the levels of heavy metal content in Soylent "are in no way toxic, and Soylent remains completely safe and nutritious".&lt;ref name=soylentprop65&gt;{{cite web|url=https://faq.soylent.com/hc/en-us/articles/204197379-California-Proposition-65|title=Soylent FAQ:  California Proposition 65}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rosa Foods also published an infographic and spreadsheet based on an FDA study of heavy metal content in common foods, comparing two selected example meals to servings of Soylent with a similar amount of caloric intake. Both of the company's chosen comparison meals include high levels of cadmium and [[arsenic]], along with levels of lead similar to those of Soylent; although one of them includes [[tuna]] and the other includes [[salmon]], providing over 97% of the arsenic in each proposed meal, with [[spinach]] providing 74% of the cadmium in the higher-cadmium meal and [[fruit cocktail]] providing 71% of the lead in the higher-lead meal.

===Product recalls===
On October 12, 2016, the company announced it would halt sales of the Soylent Bar due to reports of gastrointestinal illness.&lt;ref name="bars_halt"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mole|first1=Beth|title=Soylent halts sale of bars; investigation into illnesses continues|url=https://arstechnica.com/science/2016/10/soylent-halts-sale-of-bars-investigation-into-illnesses-continues/|accessdate=13 October 2016|publisher=[[Ars Technica]]|date=12 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company asked customers to discard any unconsumed bars and said it would offer full refunds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lomas|first1=Natasha|title=Soylent Bars recalled after some customers get sick|url=https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/13/soylent-bars-recalled-after-some-customers-get-sick/|accessdate=13 October 2016|work=TechCrunch|date=13 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 21, 2016, the company triggered a product recall, and the [[Canadian Food Inspection Agency]] (CFIA) announced it had commenced a food safety investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=[[Canadian Food Inspection Agency]]|title=Food Recall Warning: Soylent brand Food Bar recalled due to reported illnesses|date=October 21, 2016|url=http://www.inspection.gc.ca/about-the-cfia/newsroom/food-recall-warnings/complete-listing/2016-10-21/eng/1477082429290/1477082432549|accessdate=October 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 27, 2016, the company also halted sales of Soylent Powder. The company said tests on the bar had come back negative for contamination, but also said that some powder users had reported similar stomach-related symptoms from consuming the powder.&lt;ref&gt;[https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/28/soylent-pulls-powder-as-part-of-probe-into-customer-sickness/ Soylent pulls Powder as part of probe into customer sickness] Techcrunch, October 28, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="latimesrecall"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/business/technology/la-fi-tn-soylent-recall-20161027-story.html|title=Soylent halts sales of its powder as customers keep getting sick|last=Dave|first=Paresh|date=27 October 2016|publisher=Los Angeles Times|language=English|accessdate=28 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 7, 2016, Soylent blamed algal flour for making people sick, and said it planned to remove algal flour from future formulations of the powders and bars, which it did in the next formulation version 1.7 introduced on December 15, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/7/13551080/soylent-algal-flour-meal-replacement-powder-bar-recall Soylent blames algal flour for consumer complaints] November 7, 2016. The Verge Retrieved November 7, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; The drink-based products use algal oil, not algal flour, so are deemed to be safe for users.

== Flavor and product reviews ==

Rhinehart called the flavor of the original versions "minimal", "broad" and "nonspecific".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.inc.com/amy-whyte/stephen-colbert-tries-liquid-food-substitute-soylent.html |title=Stephen Colbert Taste Tests Soylent...

Soylent 1.0 contains [[soybean|soy]] [[lecithin]] and [[sucralose]] as [[flavor masker|masking flavors]] and to adjust appearance, texture and smell.&lt;ref name=blog-more-to-food/&gt;
Before version 1.4, [[vanillin]] was included as an ingredient for flavoring.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://blog.soylent.me/post/112067551237/soylent-1-4-begins-shipping-today |title=Soylent 1.4 begins shipping today.|date=February 25, 2015 |accessdate=20 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dylan Matthews of ''The Washington Post'' noted in 2013 that Soylent fulfills a similar need as [[medical food]]s such as [[Abbott Laboratories]]'s Jevity, but for a much lower cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2013/03/14/rob-rhinehart-has-a-crazy-plan-to-let-you-go-without-food-forever-it-just-might-work/ |title=Rob Rhinehart has a crazy plan to let you go without food forever.

Reviews on the taste of powdered Soylent vary. One reviewer said he was "pleasantly surprised" with the "rich, creamy, and strangely satisfying" flavor,&lt;ref name=verge&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ziegler|first1=Chris|title=Soylent survivor: one month living on lab-made liquid nourishment|url=https://www.theverge.com/2014/7/17/5893221/soylent-survivor-one-month-living-on-lab-made-liquid-nourishment|website=[[The Verge]]|accessdate=23 February 2016|date=17 July 2014|quote=Each box contains seven packets of powder – one per day – paired with seven bottles of a [[fish oil]] / [[canola oil]] blend.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and another likened it to that of a vanilla milkshake with the texture of pancake batter.&lt;ref name=LoveInsider&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/soylent-review-2014-7|title=Soylent Review|work=[[Business Insider]]|date=July 14, 2014 |first=Dylan |last=Love}}&lt;/ref&gt; Negative reviewers said it tasted "like someone wrung out a dishtowel into a glass",&lt;ref name=ChenGawker/&gt; said "my mouth tastes hot and like old cheese",&lt;ref name=ChenGawker&gt;{{citation|url=http://gawker.com/we-drank-soylent-the-weird-food-of-the-future-510293401|title=We Drank Soylent, The Weird Food of the Future|work=[[Gawker]]|date=May 19, 2013|accessdate=2017-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; or that it was "purposefully bland", "vile" and made the taster "gag"&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=Arwa |last=Mahdawi |url=https://www.theguardian.com/global/2016/feb/08/inside-stupid-hackathon-extremely-stupid-ideas |title=Mansplain it to Me: inside the Stupid Hackathon for extremely stupid ideas |work=[[The Guardian]]|date=8 February 2016|accessdate=8 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and compared the taste to "homemade nontoxic [[Play-Doh]]".&lt;ref name=verge/&gt;&lt;ref name=Manjoo&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/29/technology/personaltech/the-soylent-revolution-will-not-be-pleasurable.html |title=The Soylent Revolution Will Not Be Pleasurable |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=May 28, 2014 |last=Manjoo |first=Farhad }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Farhad Manjoo of ''[[The New York Times]]'' said he "found Soylent to be a punishingly boring, joyless product".&lt;ref name=Manjoo/&gt; Chris Ziegler of ''[[The Verge]]'', who experimented with subsisting only on Soylent for almost a month, said that although he liked and "never really tired of the flavor", he still concluded that "Soylent isn't living, it's merely surviving", and described the apple he ate at the end of that period as "my first meal back from the abyss" and the best he'd ever had in his life.&lt;ref name=verge/&gt;
Adrian Chen of ''[[Gawker]]'' said "Soylent looks as appetizing as it sounds. The combination of its off-white color, opacity and viscosity made it look – sorry to be gross here – like watered-down semen."&lt;ref name=ChenGawker/&gt; He said he "was having trouble getting it down", and eventually "dumped the whole thing in the sink".&lt;ref name=ChenGawker/&gt;

Both Manjoo and Ziegler said they had experienced some gastrointestinal problems from drinking it.&lt;ref name=Manjoo/&gt;&lt;ref name=verge/&gt; Lee Hutchinson of ''[[Ars Technica]]'' also reported a brief period of "adaptation gas" at the beginning of a four-day experiment.&lt;ref name=HutchDoesSoylent&gt;{{cite web |url=https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2013/09/ars-does-soylent-the-finale-soylent-dreams-for-people/ |title=Ars does Soylent, the finale: Soylent dreams for people |first=Lee |last=Hutchinson |work=[[Ars Technica]] |date=September 15, 2013 |accessdate=2017-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amongst the new flavors, Mocha has been described as similar to a "caffeinated Nesquik drink,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/soylent-coffiest-review-2016-8|title=I gave up breakfast for a week and drank this caffeinated meal-replacement shake instead|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Nectar has been described negatively as tasting like "lemon aspartame."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.takerisksbehappy.com/soylent-nectar-review/|title=Soylent Nectar Review - Take Risks Be Happy|date=9 January 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The [[Florida State University]] College of Education'': [https://web.archive.org/web/20120522091406/http://etd.lib.fsu.edu/theses/available/etd-07102007-225407 Women's Voices on College Drinking: The First-Year College Experience"]&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[adverse reaction]] of [[Substance intoxication|intoxication]] that causes a state of [[vertigo]] and [[nausea]],&lt;ref name="dartmouth"&gt;''[[Dartmouth College]]'': [http://www.dartmouth.edu/~healthed/groups/dapa/otherdrugs/pot.html "Marijuana / Cannabis"]&lt;/ref&gt; causing one to feel as if "spinning out of control",&lt;ref name="battery"&gt;Patrick Gibson. ''patrickgibson.com'': [http://patrickgibson.com/news/archive/battery/ "Battery Review"]&lt;/ref&gt; especially when lying down.

This state is likely to cause [[vomiting]],&lt;ref name="binge"&gt;Linda C. Lederman, Lea P. Stewart, Lisa Laitman, Fern Goodhart, &amp; 
Richard Powell. ''The Higher Education Center for Alcohol and Other Drug Prevention: [http://www.higheredcenter.org/files/product/case-binge.pdf "A Case Against "Binge" as the Term of Choice: How to Get College Students to Personalize Messages about Dangerous Drinking"]&lt;/ref&gt; but having the spins is not life-threatening unless [[pulmonary aspiration]] occurs.&lt;ref name="dartmouth"/&gt;

==Symptoms==

The most common general symptom of having the spins is described by its name: the feeling that one has the uncontrollable sense of spinning, although one is not in motion, which is one of the main reasons an [[Substance intoxication|intoxicated]] person may vomit.&lt;ref name="sermon"&gt;Timothy Peck. ''FlockFinder.com'': [http://www.flockfinder.com/11_sermons_3_ss.htm "Today's spotlight sermon on Addiction"]&lt;/ref&gt; The person has this feeling due to impairments in vision and [[equilibrioception]]. [[Diplopia]] (double vision) or polyplopia are common, as well as the symptoms of [[motion sickness]] and [[vertigo (medical)|vertigo]].&lt;ref name="discovery"/&gt;

==Causes==
Ingesting a great deal of alcohol in a short amount of time causes alcohol to quickly enter the bloodstream.&lt;ref name="drugguy"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Wolfsberg |first1=Jeff |title=Ask the Drug Guy: Is the phrase "Beer before liquor, never sicker - liquor before beer, in the clear" accurate, and if so, why? |url=http://thedrugguy.com/2007/10/07/drinking-myths-and-misconceptions/ |accessdate=February 10, 2013 |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20120220144327/http://www.jeffwolfsberg.com/alcohol-drug-education-programs/drinking-myths-and-misconceptions |archivedate=February 20, 2012 |date=October 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mixing alcohol with normal [[soft drink]]s, rather than [[diet soft drink|diet drinks]] delays the dizzying effects of alcohol because the sugary mixture slows the emptying of the stomach, so that drunkenness occurs less rapidly.&lt;ref name="diet"&gt;''[[CNN]]'': [http://www.cnn.com/2008/HEALTH/diet.fitness/06/27/rs.food.pairings/index.html "Food pairings: Working for or against you?"]&lt;/ref&gt;

The dizzying effects of alcohol&lt;ref name="dartmouth"/&gt; upset the fragile mechanism that the [[inner ear]] uses to balance.&lt;ref name="discovery"&gt;Mark Porter.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Balance in the body is monitored principally by two systems, both of which are affected by alcohol sending abnormal impulses to the brain, [which tells it] that the body is rotating, causing disorientation and making the eyes spin round to compensate.&lt;ref name="treatmentnow"&gt;''treament-now.com'': [http://www.treatment-now.com/resources/alcohol/ "Alcohol"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This "upset" has been seen in experiments in which human subjects were given clinical tests of the [[vestibular system]] before and after ingesting alcohol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tianwu|first=H|author2=Watanabe, Y |author3=Asai, M |author4=Shimizu, K |author5=Takada, S |author6=Mizukoshi, K |title=Effects of alcohol ingestion on vestibular function in postural control.|journal=Acta Oto-Laryngologica Supplementum|year=1995|volume=519|pages=127–31|pmid=7610847}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Post|first=RB |author2=Lott, LA |author3=Beede, JI |author4=Maddock, RJ|title=The effect of alcohol on the vestibulo-ocular reflex and apparent concomitant motion.|journal=Journal of Vestibular Research: Equilibrium &amp; Orientation|date=May–Jun 1994|volume=4|issue=3|pages=181–7|pmid=7921336}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The alcohol apparently causes the [[ampullary cupula]] in the [[semicircular canal]] to become lighter than the surrounding fluid ([[endolymph]]), which causes the system to become sensitive to gravity in addition to rotational acceleration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fetter|first=M|author2=Haslwanter, T |author3=Bork, M |author4=Dichgans, J |title=New insights into positional alcohol nystagmus using three-dimensional eye-movement analysis.|journal=Annals of Neurology|date=February 1999|volume=45|issue=2|pages=216–23|pmid=9989624|doi=10.1002/1531-8249(199902)45:2&lt;216::aid-ana12&gt;3.0.co;2-f}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The spins are often reported when alcohol is mixed with [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]], since both may cause dizziness&lt;ref name="dartmouth"/&gt; and magnify each other's effects.&lt;ref name="washingtonian"&gt;Cindy Rich. ''[[Washingtonian (magazine)|Washingtonian]]'': [http://www.washingtonian.com/articles/businesscareers/6348.html "Getting High"]&lt;/ref&gt; Smoking after drinking especially intensifies the effects of the alcohol,&lt;ref name="wwu"/&gt; often resulting in nausea.&lt;ref name="dartmouth"/&gt;

==Treatment and prevention==
Since at least some of the symptoms of "the spins" can be attributed to alcohol's disturbance of the vestibular system, many symptom relief strategies are based on increasing the body's ability to use other senses to regain balance. In addition to the vestibular system, vision and touch information from the body are extremely important in maintaining balance. In fact, the vestibular system is not necessary at all to maintain standing balance unless information from the other two systems becomes inadequate.&lt;ref name=Horak53&gt;{{cite journal|last=Horak|first=FB|title=Postural compensation for vestibular loss and implications for rehabilitation.|journal=Restorative Neurology and Neuroscience|year=2010|volume=28|issue=1|page=53|pmid=20086283|doi=10.3233/RNN-2010-0515|pmc=2965039}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Keeping one foot flat on the ground while trying to sleep is one popular self-treatment for people whose dizziness is exacerbated by lying down with eyes closed.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} There is no direct scientific evidence to support this treatment, however it is consistent with studies showing that postural balance responses to high and low speed tilts are primarily driven by force and velocity receptors in the muscles with relatively little input from the vestibular system.&lt;ref name=Horak54&gt;{{cite journal|last=Horak|first=FB|title=Postural compensation for vestibular loss and implications for rehabilitation.|journal=Restorative neurology and neuroscience|year=2010|volume=28|issue=1|page=54|pmid=20086283|doi=10.3233/RNN-2010-0515|pmc=2965039}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One way to mask the symptoms of the spins is to avoid staring at moving objects, such as people who are dancing or [[ceiling fan]]s. Instead, it helps to stare at a non-moving object and slowly blink a few times. However, it will make things worse to keep one's eyes closed for an extended period. In minor cases of the spins, simply sitting alone in a quiet place or [[walking|taking a walk]] is all it takes to make them subside.

The best ways to avoid the spins are to continuously keep monitoring one's alcohol intake, which involves limiting one's intake to a reasonable level&lt;ref name="hangovercure"&gt;admin. ''Craig Hitchens Therapies'': [http://craighitchenstherapies.com/articles/natural-hang-over-cure-kind-of/comment-page-1/ "Natural Hang Over Cure - Kind Of!"]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=September 2009}} and to eat before drinking, which allows alcohol to be metabolized more efficiently and steadily and will keep one's blood sugar levels more even.&lt;ref name="hangovercure"/&gt; Certain foods, such as [[cracker (food)|crackers]] and [[cheese]], have the right levels of [[carbohydrates]], [[fat]], and [[protein]] to help further slow the emptying of one's [[stomach]].&lt;ref name="diet"/&gt;

==In popular culture==
Someone getting or having the spins is mentioned in several books, including: ''Being Irish'' by Joseph Keefe,&lt;ref name="irish"&gt;Joseph Keefe. [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=AT6n9IXfoNYC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA7&amp;dq=%22had+the+spins%22&amp;ots=DuXAkIzrwJ&amp;sig=EthgjumONrrvErQTEdoiDYxzzcM] ''Being Irish'']&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Girls' Guide to Surviving a Break-Up'' by [[Hirsh|Delphine Hirsh]],&lt;ref name="binge"/&gt; ''The Stranger Guide to [[Seattle]]'' by Paula Gilovich and Traci Vogel,&lt;ref name="seattle"&gt;Paula Gilovich &amp; Traci Vogel.

The cause of the spins is also described in Season 1, Episode 10 of the Netflix Original Series ''[[Marvel's Daredevil]]'' during a discussion between two main characters, Matt Murdock and Foggy Nelson, after a night of drinking. Murdock confirms when asked by Nelson that he still gets the spins despite being blind due to disturbed equilibrium of the fluid in the inner ear. The [[Pittsburgh]] [[rapper]], [[Mac Miller]]'s album ''K.I.D.S'' featured a track titled "The Spins". Danger Ronnie and the Spins associate this into their name and music. Rock musician [[Brian Head Welch]] references experiencing the spins during his time as an alcoholic and drug addict. He mentions the symptoms were particularly noticeable when laying down with his eyes closed. These references were made in his self-debuted album track "Flush". The [[Philadelphia]] band [[Modern Baseball]] make reference to the spins in their 2014 track ''Rock Bottom'', from the album ''[[You're Gonna Miss It All]]''.

'''St. John Ambulance of Malaysia''' ([[Malay language|''Rumi'' Malay]]: '''''St. John Ambulans Malaysia''''', [[Malay language|''Jawi'' Malay]]: سينت جون ايمبيولنس مليسيا, [[Traditional Chinese characters|Traditional Chinese]]: 馬來西亞聖約翰救護機構, [[Simplified Chinese characters|Simplified Chinese]]: 马来西亚圣约翰救护机构, [[Tamil language|Tamil]]: செயின்ட் ஜான் ஆம்புலன்ஸ் மலேசியா, [[Abbreviation]]: '''SJAM''') is a Malaysian-based, non-profit statutory body dedicated to the works of humanity and charity for the relief of persons in sickness, distress, suffering or danger without any distinction of race, class, colour or creed. With a history stretching back over a century, SJAM forms part of the wider [[St. John Ambulance]], a foundation of the [[Venerable Order of Saint John]] with presence in 41 sovereign states, dependencies, autonomies or territories.

==History==
The history of St. John Ambulance in the present day [[Malaysia]] started in 1908 with the formation of St. John Ambulance Association ("SJAA") by a group of medical officers in the Colonial Medical Service; Capt. Dr. John Sutton Webster, Dr. Richard Desmond Fitzgerald and Mr. Arthur Mitchell Goodman were among the pioneers of St. John Ambulance activities in the then [[British Malaya]]. When the war clouds were gathering in 1938, the British Administration decided to form the St. John Ambulance Brigade ("SJAB") in all larger towns. By 1939, SJAB could be found in the [[Federated Malay States]] and [[Straits Settlements]], plus the unfederated states of [[Kelantan]], [[Johor]] and [[Kedah]]. SJAB members were first recruited as stretcher-bearers. Once they were proficient, they attended first aid lectures. In early 1941, regular meetings and air raid practices were held with the Air Raid Precaution Corps.&lt;ref name="Order"&gt;https://www.stjohninternational.org/malaysia&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1941, the authorities introduced the Medical Auxiliary Service and all SJAB members were automatically drafted into this service. When the Japanese Forces raided the Malay Peninsula from 8 December 1941, the SJAB members did magnificent work in all the first aid posts. Many SJAB members withdraw to the south together with the British Forces as their towns were captured one after another by the Japanese Forces. Many more served in the Battle of Singapore and lost their lives for the Service of Mankind. St. John Ambulance was the only voluntary organisation in the Malay Peninsula that rendered medical services before and during the Second World War.&lt;ref name="Order" /&gt;

The return of the British after the end of the Second World War has resulted in the re-organisation of many institutions and that contributed to the expansion of SJAA and SJAB in [[British Malaya|Malaya]] and [[North Borneo]].

In a move to further strengthen the operations of SJAA and SJAB, particularly after the independence of Malaya in 1957 and the subsequent merger between Malaya, Sabah and Sarawak (to form Malaysia) in 1963, the Government of Malaysia decided to amalgamate SJAA and SJAB in Malaya, Sabah and Sarawak into one Corporation known as the St. John Ambulance of Malaysia. This was made possible with the passing of the St. John Ambulance of Malaysia (Incorporation) Act, 1972 by the Federal Parliament. The Royal Assent was granted on 23 March 1972.&lt;ref name="Act"&gt;http://www.commonlii.org/my/legis/consol_act/sjaoma1972410&lt;/ref&gt;

==Leadership and Governance==
The present leadership and governance structure of SJAM was established following the enactment of St. John Ambulance of Malaysia (Incorporation) Act, 1972 (including its subsidiary legislations).

The [[Yang di-Pertuan Agong]] is the Royal Patron of SJAM.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.malaysianmonarchy.org.my/portal_bi/rk1/rk1.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The appointment is currently held by the reigning monarch, [[Muhammad V of Kelantan|Sultan Muhammad V]].

The affairs of SJAM are governed by the St. John Council of Malaysia,&lt;ref name="Act" /&gt; presided by the National President and the Deputy National President. By law, the roles are automatically conferred to the [[Prime Minister of Malaysia]] and the [[Ministry of Health (Malaysia)|Minister of Health, Malaysia]] respectively and, they are respectively held by [[Tun Dr. Mahathir bin Mohamad]] and [[Dzulkefly Ahmad|Dr. Dzulkefly bin Ahmad]] at present. Membership of the Council consists of principal officers of SJAM, representatives from various Federal ministries and agencies, as well as individuals of high standing who are independent.

Day-to-day management affairs rests with the Commander-in-Chief, who is also the Chairman of Council.

==Organisational Structure==
SJAM is headed by a Commander-in-Chief. Appointed by the National President, he is responsible to the Council as the chief executive of the Corporation, assisted by a Deputy Commander-in-Chief. The appointment of Commander-in-Chief is currently held by Dato' Lai See Ming, KStJ whereas his deputy is Prof. Dato' Sri Dr. Haji Abu Hassan Asaari bin Abdullah.

SJAM has two main areas of activity, as follows:

* '''Operations:''' SJAM provides volunteer first aid services at events and emergencies. In metropolitan areas, SJAM provides emergency medical assistance service through a combination of paid staff and volunteers. As the service wing of SJAM, the Operations Wing is responsible for the training, development and management of volunteers in first aid and pre-hospital care. The Operations Wing at the National Headquarters is headed by Dato' Yeo Kim Thong, KStJ, Chief-of-Staff (Operations).
* '''Training:''': SJAM is a leading first aid training provider in Malaysia. The Training Wing offers a wide range of training programme on first aid and advanced topics to the public besides providing technical assistance to support the training and development needs and quality assessments of the Operations Wing. The Training Wing at the National Headquarters is headed by Dato' Dr. Lee Hoo Teong, KStJ, Chief-of-Staff (Training).

The SJAM National Headquarters, in [[Kuala Lumpur]], oversees the activities of SJAM in the whole of Malaysia. The organisation is then divided into 14 States/Region, each having their own State/Regional Headquarters. With the exception of the Region of Wilayah Persekutuan (''Federal Territory'', consisting the cities of [[Kuala Lumpur]] and [[Putrajaya]]), all other states are divided into Areas (each with an Area Headquarters) to smoothen the coordination process amongst Divisions and the State Headquarters due to geographical factors. Grassroots volunteers are grouped into Divisions.

With the exception of a handful of paid staff, all other personnel in SJAM, including the principal officers at the National Headquarters, are volunteers.

==Membership==
Membership in SJAM is open to all individuals of good character, good physique and medically fit between 17 and 65 years of age. SJAM accepts suitable and interested individuals from all walks of life but passing the Basic First Aid examination is a pre-requisite before an individual is recognised as having attained the minimum competency to be a uniformed volunteer. First aid training and induction courses are provided to all prospective volunteers free of charge.

SJAM is led by volunteers appointed to functional roles. While all new volunteers would usually be admitted at the basic rank of Ambulance Member (male) or Nursing Member (female), a higher rank may be subsequently assigned, as appropriate, based on respective functional appointments to describe a formal grade within the organisation conferring authority.

===Skills===

Volunteers are provided with progressive training and re-training opportunities and can complete a number of first aid qualifications. Training for basic to intermediate skill sets are usually provided at Divisional-level, whereas training for additional and enhanced skills such as ambulance driving and handling, management of mass-casualty incidents, as well as the use of an automated external defibrillator ("AED") are centrally conducted by suitable qualified trainers at the State/Regional Headquarters or Area Headquarters.

[[Image:SJAM Operations1.JPG|thumb|CPR and the use of AED]]

===Healthcare Professionals===

Whilst the majority of volunteers in SJAM are non-healthcare professionals, SJAM welcomes the involvement of healthcare professionals such as Medical Practitioners, Paramedics, Nurses and Medical Assistants to volunteer. Unlike the rest, healthcare professionals do not require to demonstrate their competency through attaining first aid certificates, but their qualifications and professional status are checked with the appropriate regulatory body before admission to SJAM. Healthcare professionals are required for tasks appropriate to their technical competencies during operational duties, as well as training for other volunteers in certain enhanced skills.

===Developing Human Capital===

Suitably experienced volunteers, upon demonstrating outstanding competency in Advanced First Aid, may be chosen to be developed as First Aid Trainers. Chosen candidates will undergo development, exposure and assessment in methodology of training before being accredited as First Aid Trainers. Volunteers with such accreditation are entrusted to facilitate training and re-training activities for other volunteers, as well as first aid courses for the public.

Relevant training activities targeting on management, administration and leadership are also provided to volunteers appointed to functional roles. Many volunteers argued that their experience in SJAM, coupled with such exposures, have somewhat given an edge to their career.

==Operations Wing==
Consistent with its motto and objectives, SJAM offers a wide range of first aid and pre-hospital care services to the public through its Operations Wing, mostly provided free of charge.

===Public Duty===

SJAM volunteers attend thousands of events across the country every year, covering a variety of public events such as marathons and other sporting events, parades, public gatherings, and concerts, providing first aid to the sick and injured. Such service is provided free at the point of delivery, although a charge may be levied on the event organiser for attendance at commercial events. The provision of services during public duties are not limited to first aid; ambulances are provided in most events for rapid transportation. Where necessary, SJAM may also provide healthcare professionals to provide assistance at mobile treatment centres.

SJAM has also successfully experimented the use of bicycles to maximise on efficiency and effectiveness during public duties involving a larger area of coverage. SJAM currently has two [[Cycle responder|Cycle Response Units]] in [[Kuala Lumpur]] and [[Penang]], staff by the volunteers of SJAM Wilayah Persekutuan and SJAM Penang respectively.

Due to its commendable and consistent track record, SJAM has also been deployed to render aid to the sick and wounded in many difficult situations; more recently, the [[Bersih rally (disambiguation)|Bersih Rallies]]&lt;ref&gt;http://minda-kembara.blogspot.com/2007/11/hawker-police-broke-my-knee-during.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://bersih.org/?p=546&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2012/4/29/nation/11200043&amp;sec=nation&lt;/ref&gt; in 2007, 2011 and 2012, as well as the [[2007 HINDRAF rally|HINDRAF Rally]] in 2007, all occurred in Kuala Lumpur. SJAM volunteers have acted professionally and neutrally, and provided relief without any distinction of race, class, colour or creed.

===Transport Duty===

SJAM is certified by the Malaysian Book of Records as the voluntary organisation with the largest fleet of ambulances in Malaysia. All ambulances are commissioned for active transport duties of the following nature:

====Emergency Medical Assistance Service ("EMAS")====

SJAM provides support to the Ministry of Health's statutory ambulance service in metropolitan areas, responding to 999 calls and assisting during times of major incidents. From its humble beginning in Kuala Lumpur and greater Klang Valley on 10 September 1998, EMAS has now been extended statewide in [[Selangor]] and [[Penang]], and selected cities and towns in [[Kedah]], [[Perak]], [[Johor]] and [[Sabah]].

SJAM was the first in Malaysia to introduce the use of AED in 2001 - it began when all EMAS ambulances in Kuala Lumpur, operated by SJAM Wilayah Persekutuan, were fitted with an AED each.

====Expressway Emergency Ambulance Service====

Motor vehicle accidents rate is significantly higher during major festivities due to the ''balik kampung'' (home return) rush. Many incidents along the expressways and highways became fatal due to delays in pre-hospital care. Since 1996, SJAM began stationing ambulances and volunteers at strategic locations along expressways and major highways during major festivities as one of its efforts to ensure quicker response to such incidents.

====Non-emergency Transport Service====

The large fleet of ambulances is also used in the provision of non-emergency transport service, transferring patients with limited mobility and/or requiring care during the journey to every part of the country, as well as into neighbouring countries (Singapore and Thailand), where land crossing permits.

===Emergency Medical Air Rescue Service ("EMARS")===

Since 2010, SJAM has been partnering the [[Royal Malaysian Police Air Wing Unit|Air Unit of the Royal Malaysian Police]] ("RMP") in providing EMARS. Based at [[Simpang Airport]] near downtown Kuala Lumpur, the RMP helicopters are capable of being converted into air ambulances where necessary, and during EMARS deployment, specially-trained SJAM volunteers are assigned to provide patient care on board.
[[File:SJAM Project Upsize Emergency Medical Air Rescue Service.jpg|thumb|A poster created for the 2012 recruitment campaign of SJAM Wilayah Persekutuan in Kuala Lumpur and Putrajaya, featuring the Emergency Medical Air Rescue Service]]

==Training Wing==
The services of Training Wing is 2-prong. Besides providing support to the Operations Wing through the formulation of curriculum and provision of technical training/assessment, the Training Wing is also responsible in addressing the first aid learning and education needs of the public.

===External Courses===

SJAM runs first aid courses for external individuals and organisations in return for a modest fee. SJAM has assisted many commercial establishments in training their employees as first aiders based on the popular First Aid at Work syllabus.
[[Image:SJAM MassCPR.jpg|thumb|Reach-out efforts such as Mass CPR are made from time to time to create greater awareness amongst members of the public]]

===Diploma in Pre-Hospital Emergency Care===

SJAM, in collaboration with the [[Open University Malaysia]] ("OUM") contemplates to develop a 3-year Diploma programme in pre-hospital emergency care using the blended pedagogy of face-to-face learning, online participation of learners to interact with tutors and their peers, self learning through a module and relevant materials in OUM's Tan Sri Abdullah Sanusi Digital Library and attachments at SJAM's EMAS in various parts in Malaysia as well as in hospitals. This programme, recognised by the Malaysian Quality Agency and the Ministry of Higher Education, is designed to address the acute and urgent need to develop a sophisticated pre-hospital care system in Malaysia to upgrade knowledge and skills of emergency medical technicians.&lt;ref&gt;http://sonahs.oum.edu.my/index.php?op=view&amp;m=2&amp;page=47&lt;/ref&gt; The first intake for this programme took place in mid-2010.

===Capacity Building===

Among the initiatives of the Training Wing in support of capacity building efforts in pre-hospital care systems in Malaysia are as follows:

====SJAM Academy====

SJAM also owns and manages an in-house Clinical Skill Lab, branded as SJAM Academy. Located in Cheras, Kuala Lumpur, the Clinical Skill Lab is fitted with state-of-the-art facilities to facilitate training in pre-hospital care, and is predominantly used for the SJAM-OUM Diploma in Pre-Hospital Emergency Care programme and advanced training for volunteers. The opening of SJAM Academy was officiated by [[Anthony Mellows|Professor Anthony Roger Mellows]], Lord Prior of the Venerable Order of Saint John on 13 January 2012.&lt;ref&gt;http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?sec=central&amp;file=/2012/1/14/central/10245575&lt;/ref&gt;

====National Open Pre-Hospital Care Competition====

SJAM also promotes continuous learning through healthy competitions of knowledge and skills between pre-hospital care providers in Malaysia. The binneial National Open Pre-Hospital Care Competition is a relatively new initiative championed by SJAM to bring together pre-hospital care providers, both paid personnel and volunteers, from all over the country to compete in a scenario-based competition.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sjampenang.org.my/phc09&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://emergencywebnotes.blogspot.com/2010/01/tuan-rs-gurcharan-singh-challenge.html&lt;/ref&gt; The winners of Tuan RS Gurcharan Singh Challenge Trophy since the inaugural competition in 2009 are as follows:
* '''2009:''' St John Ambulance of Malaysia (Kuala Lumpur Bukit Bintang Combined Adult Division, Wilayah Persekutuan)
* '''2011:''' Hospital Pulau Pinang (Accident and Emergency Department)

==Other Services to the Community==
Besides the main areas of services, SJAM also provides various services to the community; some are specific to local needs. Among them:
* '''Haemodialysis Service:''' SJAM operates a total of 18 Haemodialysis Centres across the country, providing affordable services to patients with renal failure from the underprivileged group in various parts of [[Selangor]], [[Malacca]], [[Penang]], [[Perak]], [[Pahang]] and [[Sarawak]].
* '''Geriatric Care:''' SJAM runs a Nursing Home for the Elderly in [[Taiping, Perak|Taiping]], [[Perak]].
* '''Free Medical Consultation:''' SJAM operates a clinic which operates for 3 hours on selected Sundays at [[Bandar Hilir]], [[Malacca]], providing free medical consultation to the underprivileged.

==SJAM Uniform==
[[Image:SJAM Parade1.jpg|thumb|Officers in Uniform No. 1 during a ceremonial parade at [[Merdeka Square, Kuala Lumpur]]]]
[[File:SJAM Duty.jpg|thumb|High visibility waistcoat is often worn over Uniform No. 2 during duties for increased visibility and ease of identification, particularly at night]]
With traditions and customs inherited from the SJAB, SJAM is somewhat paramilitary in its protocol and image and hence, SJAM volunteers is recognisable by its distinct white-and-black uniform. Volunteers are required to wear uniform to provide services, both for identification and to present a professional image. Unlike the uniform of other volunteer organisations in Malaysia, SJAM uniform is protected by the law, and may only be worn by volunteers who have been certified to have at least the minimum competency to be a uniformed personnel.

There are presently three orders of dress intended for different situations, as follows:
* '''Uniform No. 1:''' Ceremonial Uniform, an elaborate uniform worn during ceremonial occasions only.
* '''Uniform No. 2:''' Duty Uniform, a basic operational uniform suitable for all types of duties, as well as parades and formations.
* '''Uniform No. 3:''' Mess Dress, an evening dress worn at formal occasions.

Uniform No. 2 is the most widely used among the three. Yellow/green two-tone high visibility garments are sometimes worn over Uniform No. 2 for outdoor events for safety and ease of identification. For Officers, there are two variants of Uniform No. 2. Beret is worn during operational duties and field parade events only, whereas Peaked Cap (male) or Bowler's Hat (female) are used in Uniform No. 2 in events other than operational duties.

For training and informal events, Training Order (consisting green-white/white SJAM polo T-shirt and black trousers similar to Uniform No. 2) is worn. On rare occasions (subject to waiver instructions), Training Order is also used for operational duties, but it is usually invoked during disasters which requires rapid mobilisation and deployment of volunteers, or when long hours of stand-by is required or expected.

While Officers are expected to maintain all of the orders of dress as discussed above, Uniforms No. 1 and 3 remains optional to the members of other ranks (Staff Sergeant and below).

==SJAM Cadets==
SJAM Cadets is the youth section of SJAM for young people aged between 10 and 17 years (inclusive). The history of SJAM Cadets could be traced to the formation of the first ambulance cadet division of SJAB in Penang back in 1938. Since then, it has grown to be one of the biggest youth activities in Malaysia. Cadet divisions can be found in most secondary schools as an extracurricular activity, where cadets take part in a wide variety of activities - providing first aid at community events, participating in first aid competitions, completing awards, attending camps and learning leadership skills.

SJAM is an affiliate of the Malaysian Youth Council.

===Cadet Awards===
There are two award schemes that cadets can achieve during their time at SJAM Cadets, as follows:

====Cadet Proficiency Scheme - Grand Prior Award====
[[File:Grand Prior Award.jpg|thumb|The Grand Prior Award badge is worn on the left sleeve. Full members of SJAM whom have been conferred the Grand Prior Award during their membership in SJAM Cadets are allowed to retain the badge on the uniform throughout their entire service.]]
The [[Grand Prior Award]], named after the Grand Prior of the Venerable Order of Saint John, is the highest award a cadet can achieve. The Cadet Proficiency Scheme involves cadets completing twelve subjects over a period not less than three years to encourage them to take an interest in subjects outside their normal curricula and widen their horizons by carrying out these studies in their leisure time. Beyond SJAM Cadets, a recipient of the Grand Prior Award is allowed to retain the Grand Prior Award badge on the uniform if he or she chooses to advance his or her status into a full member of SJAM.

====Cadet Voluntary Service Scheme - Special Service Shield====
The Special Service Shield is awarded to cadets to encourage them to undertake duties and services which benefit the community on voluntary basis. The first badge is awarded upon completing a minimum of 100 hours of service; further badges are awarded for 200, 500, 750 and ultimately, 1000 hours of service. The badge for 1000 hours of service may be retained on the uniform if the recipient chooses to advance his or her status into a full member of SJAM.

*In March, Terri is moved to Palm Gardens of Largo, a skilled nursing facility in [[Seminole, Florida]].
*The administration of one nursing home attempts, unsuccessfully, to get a restraining order against Michael because he was demanding more attention for his wife at the expense of other patients' care.

==1995==

*Michael begins his relationship with Jodi Centonze.

==1998==

*May: Michael Schiavo files a petition to discontinue feeding tube for Terri Schiavo. Terri's parents fight the petition.
*June: Richard Pearse, Esq. is appointed guardian ad litem for Terri Schiavo by the [[Circuit Court]] for [[Pinellas County, Florida]].
*September 11: Dr. Jeffrey Karp neurologically evaluates Terri and indicates that she "is in a chronic vegetative state" exhibiting "an absence of voluntary activity or cognitive behavior...inability to communicate or interact purposefully with her environment."  Karp also notes that "her chance of any improvement to a functional level is essentially zero."
*Dr. Gambone, Terri's primary care physician, informs guardian ad litem Richard Pearse that Dr. Karp's PVS diagnosis (and prognosis) is the medical consensus.
*November: Terri's parents become aware of the bone scan report that was performed in 1991. Terri's parents and Dr. [[William Hammesfahr]] claim the trauma shown in the bone scan was a result of Terri being abused by Michael. Provided with only the scan information, forensic pathologist, Dr. Michael Baden suggests a head injury caused the trauma. After learning Terri's full history, Dr. Baden agrees that the trauma is consistent with her cardiac arrest, fall, [[CPR]] attempts, and eventual [[resuscitation]]. The parents petition the Pinellas-Pasco Circuit Court for a full evidentiary hearing to evaluate the new evidence. Judge [[George Greer]] denies the motion.
*December 29: The second [[guardian ad litem]], Richard Pearse, submits his report to the Pinellas-Pasco County Circuit Court.  Pearse concludes that Terri Schiavo is in a persistent vegetative state with no possibility of improvement and that Michael Schiavo's decisions may be influenced by the potential to inherit what remains of Terri Schiavo's estate.  Due to a perceived lack of evidence for Terri's wishes, and questions regarding Michael Schiavo's credibility, Pearse recommends denying Michael Schiavo's petition to remove Terri's feeding tube.

*April 26: Terri's feeding tube is removed for the first time. It is reinserted two days later on an appeal by her parents.

==2002==

*A trial is held to determine whether or not new therapy treatments would help Terri restore any cognitive function.
:A new [[Computed axial tomography|CAT scan]] shows severe cerebral [[atrophy]]. An [[Electroencephalography|EEG]] shows no measurable brain activity.

:Five doctors are selected to provide their expert opinions to the trial. Schiavo's parents select Dr. William Maxfield, a retired radiologist, and Dr. [[William Hammesfahr]], a neurologist. Michael Schiavo selects neurologists Dr. Ron Cranford and Dr. Melvin Greer (no relation to Judge George Greer). The court selects neurologist Dr. Peter Bambakidis. These five doctors examine Terri Schiavo's medical records, brain scans, the videos, and Schiavo herself.

:Dr. Cranford, Dr. Greer, and Dr. Bambakidis testify that Terri was in a persistent vegetative state. Dr. Maxfield and Dr. Hammesfahr testify that Schiavo was in a "minimally conscious state."

:Terri's parents videotape Terri for four and a half hours. The video is edited down to several clips totaling four and a half minutes.

:Judge Greer rules that Terri Schiavo is in a PVS and was beyond hope of significant improvement.

*November 22: Judge Greer denies a motion from Terri's parents for a full evidentiary hearing to evaluate new evidence, the 1990 bone scan, which had only recently come to their attention. Greer states that the issue of trauma twelve years earlier was irrelevant to the current case.
*Florida's Second District Court of Appeal reviews previous court records and upholds the trial court's decision.

== 2003 ==

* September 11: The Schindlers petition the Pinellas County court for the Sixth Judicial Circuit.  The petition asks the court to forestall any removal of the feeding tube for "eight weeks' therapy."  Accompanying the petition are five [[affidavit]]s: four from members of the Schindler family (presumably her mother, father, brother, and sister) and one from Dr. Alexander T. Gimon.  Additional affidavits from three "speech professionals" and two nurses are included.
*September 17: Judge Greer issues a nine-page court ruling, rejecting the petition.
* October 10: The final remaining appeal filed by the Schindlers is dismissed.
* October 15: Terri's feeding tube is removed for the second time.
* October 21: The Florida Legislature passes "Terri's Law." Governor [[Jeb Bush]] immediately orders the feeding tube reinserted.
* December: Dr. Jay Wolfson reports to Governor Bush, "within the testimony, as part of the hypotheticals presented, Schindler family members stated that even if (Terri) had told them of her intention to have artificial nutrition withdrawn, they would not do it.  Throughout this painful and difficult trial, the family acknowledged that (Terri) was in a diagnosed persistent vegetative state."&lt;ref&gt;[http://abstractappeal.com/schiavo/WolfsonReport.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

== 2004 ==

*March 17: Members of the [[Florida Legislature]] consider a bill that would make removing food and water from patients in a persistent vegetative state illegal without a living will. Although the bill is passed by the [[Florida House of Representatives]] by a vote of 78 to 37, the [[Florida Senate]] defeats a similar measure hours later, 21 to 18.
*March 17: U.S. Senators [[Bill Frist]] and [[Michael Enzi]] announce that Terri Schiavo would be called to testify before the [[U.S. Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions]] on March 28 in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]]. No one expects Terri to testify, but the move extends [[United States Federal Witness Protection Program|witness protection]] to Terri, requiring reinsertion of her feeding tube.
*March 18: Greer strikes down the subpoena as unconstitutional and Terri's feeding tube is removed for the third and final time.
*March 20/21: [[U.S. Congress]] approves emergency legislation, the [[Palm Sunday Compromise]].

*March 22: Three Florida neurologists view 12 of Terri's [[computed tomography|CT]] scans. Dr. Leon Prockop says it was the "most severe brain damage I've seen." Dr. Walter Bradley says that he "doubts there's any activity going on in the higher levels of her brain." Dr. Michael T. Pulley says, "The chance that this person is going to recover is about zero."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kansascity.com/mld/kansascity/news/nation/11213061.htm|title=KC Breaking News, Sports, Weather &amp; More - The Kansas City Star &amp; KansasCity.com The Kansas City Star|publisher=|accessdate=18 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="56878">{{short description|The result of a contamination of the water supply of Walkerton}}
The '''2000 Walkerton outbreak of waterborne gastroenteritis''' was the result of a contamination of the water supply of [[Walkerton, Ontario]], Canada with ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]'' and ''[[Campylobacter jejuni]]'' bacteria. The contamination sickened more than two thousand people and resulted in six deaths. Two town officials eventually pleaded guilty to charges of [[Nuisance|common nuisance]] stemming from the contamination.

==Town background==
Walkerton, Ontario is a small [[township]] in the [[municipality]] of [[Brockton, Ontario|Brockton]], {{convert|180|km|mi}} northwest of [[Toronto]]. It serves as the administrative centre of Brockton, into which it was merged in 1999,&lt;ref name="CanadianEncyclopedia"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/walkerton/ | title=Walkerton | publisher=Historica Canada | work=The Canadian Encyclopedia | date=November 1, 2012 | accessdate=December 3, 2013 | author=Welch, Deborah, and Michael Payne}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as the county seat of [[Bruce County]]. The population of Walkerton in 1996 was [[Canada 1996 Census|recorded as]] 5,036 individuals within the township's {{convert|6.4|sqkm|sqmi}}.&lt;ref name="2001Census"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www12.statcan.ca/english/profil01/CP01/Details/Page.cfm?Lang=E&amp;Geo1=CSD&amp;Code1=3541036&amp;Geo2=PR&amp;Code2=35&amp;Data=Count&amp;SearchText=Walkerton&amp;SearchType=Begins&amp;SearchPR=01&amp;B1=All&amp;Custom= | title=2001 Community Profiles. | publisher=[[Statistics Canada]] | work=Statistics Canada Catalogue no. 93F0053XIE. | date=June 27, 2002 | accessdate=December 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of the 2000 events, the town's drinking water was drawn from three chlorinated wells to the west and southwest of the town.{{sfn|Bruce-Grey-Owen-Sound Health Unit|2000|pp = 1–2}} The wells were owned and operated by the Walkerton Public Utilities Commission (PUC), which was managed by Stan Koebel and run by foreman Frank Koebel.{{sfn|O'Connor|2001|pp = 7–13}}

==Contamination background==
===Walkerton Public Utilities Commission===
;System operators
In 2000, the Walkerton Public Utilities Commission was under the supervision of two men, brothers Stan and Frank Koebel.{{sfn|O'Connor|2001|pp = 182–184}} Both men had been working for the PUC since the 1970s, when they were teenagers{{sfn|O'Connor|2001|pp = 184–188}} and their father worked at the PUC.&lt;ref name="BuffaloNews"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-23197647.html | title=RECORDS FALSIFIED IN WAKE OF ONTARIO E. COLI OUTBREAK | work=The Buffalo News | date=10 December 2002 | accessdate=June 15, 2016 | author=Brown, Barry | location=Buffalo, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neither man had formal training in public utility operation or in water management, but by 2000, both had been promoted to management positions on the basis of their experience. Both brothers carried certification as class 3 water distribution system operators, licences obtained through a grandfathering program run by the Ministry of the Environment (MOE) and based on their work experience in their positions. Though Ontario law required that water systems operators receive 40 hours of continuing education per year, Stan Koebel interpreted this to include activities only marginally related to water systems, such as [[Cardiopulmonary resuscitation|CPR]] certification, and as a result neither brother used continuing education time to gain or maintain expertise in water safety.{{sfn|O'Connor|2001|pp = 184–188}}

As a result of their lack of formal training and their overseeing themselves, the Koebel brothers were relatively uninformed about water safety. Both later testified that they were not familiar with sections of the Ontario Drinking Water Standards documentation (ODWS) that dealt with tasks they needed to be aware of to do their jobs adequately: manager Stan Koebel had not read the section of the ODWS about identifying contaminated water, while foreman Frank Koebel had not read the chapter on chemical testing of water for safety purposes. Neither man had more than a passing familiarity with ''E. coli'' or the danger the bacteria posed to water systems, nor with chlorination standards and best practices.{{sfn|O'Connor|2001|pp = 184–188}}

;Well system and maintenance
The wells that drew water for Walkerton were known as Well 5, Well 6, and Well 7, with Well 5 being both the southernmost and the closest to the residential portion of the township.{{sfn|Bruce-Grey-Owen-Sound Health Unit|2000|pp = 1–2}}  Well 5, drawing water from depths of {{convert|5.5|to|5.8|m|ft|sigfig=3}} and {{convert|7.0|to|7.3|m|ft|sigfig=3}} through soft limestone, was brought online to the Walkerton water system in 1978, following a hydrological evaluation commissioned by the PUC. Because Well 5's aquifer drew partially from spring-fed, gravel-soiled zones that were prone to absorbing surface runoff, the hydrological evaluation recommended that Well 5 be monitored regularly to ensure that water was being drawn from lower well depths rather than higher ones. It also recommended that land usage in the immediate area of the well be limited in light of agricultural waste runoff being detectable in the well's water. Neither of these recommendations was implemented as conditions of operation when Well 5 received a Certificate of Approval in 1979. Multiple subsequent tests on the well between 1979 and 2000 continued to conclude that due to the shallow depth at which Well 5 was drilled and the tendency of its water level and makeup to be directly affected by surface runoff, caution toward contamination levels in the well was advisable.{{sfn|O'Connor|2001|pp = 112–126}}

Wells 6 and 7 were drilled more deeply and drew from areas of land with significantly less fractured bedrock than well 5.{{sfn|O'Connor|2001|pp = 143–147}}

In 2000, Ontario law indicated that in a community the size of Walkerton, at least thirteen water samples per month should be submitted for microbiological testing, with the samples being drawn from "the point at which the treated water enters the distribution system".{{sfn|O'Connor|2001|p = 188}} A longstanding standard at the Walkerton PUC, however, was to comply with an earlier governmental requirement of nine samples per month.{{sfn|O'Connor|2001|p = 190}} Employees were instructed to collect four weekly samples from each of the three wells that served Walkerton.{{sfn|O'Connor|2001|p = 189}} This meant that even in an ideal month, the PUC typically submitted one fewer sample than required by law; in practice, it was more common for eight or nine samples to be submitted than for thirteen to be.{{sfn|O'Connor|2001|p = 190}} In addition, the samples that were submitted often had their points of origin mislabelled; for the sake of convenience, testing employees might draw two samples from one location but label the bottles as having come from two locations, or draw a water sample from the water supply of their own home rather than from within distribution points of the system. As a result, not all water sources were being tested adequately, and there was little regularity to which ones were tested when.{{sfn|O'Connor|2001|p = 189}} Multiple Ministry of the Environment documents dating to throughout the 1990s note that Walkerton's sampling practices were lacking. Walkerton was placed on a list of non-compliant municipalities in 1997, but removed shortly thereafter after assurances from Stan Koebel that compliance would improve. Nevertheless, a 1998 inspection verified that eight or nine samples were still the standard of collection in Walkerton. The PUC was again warned about noncompliance, and again Stan Koebel agreed to improve testing practices.{{sfn|O'Connor|2001|p = 190}}

MOE reports throughout the 1990s also noted that the PUC was inadequately chlorinating water that ran through the Walkerton system. Best practices dictated that [[Water chlorination|chlorine residual]] levels after fifteen minutes of contact between the chlorine and the water be maintained at 0.5&amp;nbsp;mg/L, with that level verified through daily testing; this would indicate that the water was being adequately purified of potentially harmful microorganisms. Inspections of the Walkerton system in 1991, 1995, and 1998 showed chlorine residual levels in the Walkerton system of between 0.12&amp;nbsp;mg/L and 0.4&amp;nbsp;mg/L, with a [[mean]] level of 0.27&amp;nbsp;mg/L. According to the later ''Walkerton Inquiry'', "Stan Koebel testified that he generally set the chlorinator to slightly less than 0.5 mg/L and that Frank Koebel would lower it to approximately 0.3 mg/L several times a month." Both men felt that Walkerton water was adequately pure and safe without a 0.5&amp;nbsp;mg/L chlorine residual—they were known to willingly drink raw water from the wells—and they had received complaints from community members about system water tasting overly chlorinated.{{sfn|O'Connor|2001|pp = 192–194}} The PUC's evaluation of chlorine residual levels was typically performed weekly, rather than daily, and actual testing was often eschewed in favour of visually inspecting the "bubble" on the chlorinator for a "guesstimate" of the residual. These "guesstimates" would be noted in the PUC's daily operating sheets as if they were actual tested levels. When actual testing was performed, the 15-minute timeframe of the test was often cut short, resulting in higher-than-reality chlorine residual readings.{{sfn|O'Connor|2001|p = 194}}

[[Fecal coliform]] and ''E. coli'' testing on Well 5 between 1990 and 2000 showed ongoing deterioration in the quality of water from the well.{{sfn|O'Connor|2001|pp = 112–126}}  In the mid-1990s, a provision for more intensive monitoring of wells susceptible to groundwater contamination was added to the Ontario Drinking Water Objectives (ODWO); however, the Ministry of the Environment (MOE) failed to apply this provision to reclassifying existing wells. As a result, despite tests repeatedly showing that Well 5 was prone to contamination, it did not have any contamination alarms or emergency shut-off mechanisms.{{sfn|O'Connor|2001|pp = 112–126}} April 2000 sampling done on water from Wells 5 and 6 showed fecal coliform present in Well 5's water, both raw and treated, but not in Well 6's. Well 7 was not running during this time period and was not tested. May 1, 2000 tests showed similar results, with Well 5 being the sole apparent contaminated water source.{{sfn|O'Connor|2001|pp = 133–143}}

May 15 water testing on the Highway 9 water main construction project in Walkerton returned positive results for fecal coliform and ''E. coli''.{{sfn|O'Connor|2001|pp = 63–65}} Due to inaccurate labelling of the samples' sources by PUC personnel, it was unclear to the testing laboratory which water samples had come from Walkerton's raw water versus its treated water, or which water had come from which well source;{{sfn|O'Connor|2001|pp = 60–62}} however, the laboratory notified Stan Koebel on May 17 that submitted samples had tested positive for ''E. coli'' and fecal coliform. Personnel from the testing laboratory, unaware that Ontario Drinking Water Objectives mandated the notification of the Ministry of the Environment in such a case, did not notify any agency besides the PUC of the failed testing results.{{sfn|O'Connor|2001|pp = 63–65}}

===Contamination period===
Using knowledge about typical incubation periods of [[E. coli O157:H7|''E. coli'' O157:H7]] (average 3–4 days) and ''Campylobacter'' (average 2–5 days) bacteria {{sfn|Bruce-Grey-Owen-Sound Health Unit|2000|p = 3}} and working backwards from the first emergence of symptoms in the community, investigators determined that the majority of infected community members had been exposed to the bacteria between May 13 and May 16 and the contamination had thus likely entered the infective well on or about May 12.{{sfn|O'Connor|2001|pp = 147–154}}

In the spring of 2000, Walkerton's system typically drew most of its water from one well at a time, alternating unevenly between wells 5, 6, and 7. Well 7 was turned off between March 10 and May 2, ran alone from May 2 through May 9 before turning off again, and was then used again between May 15 and May 19. From May 9 to May 13, Well 5 provided the bulk of Walkerton's water, supplemented from May 10–13 by Well 6.{{sfn|O'Connor|2001|pp = 130–131}}{{refn|group=note|Details for Well 6's pumpage between May 14 and May 18 were improperly recorded and could not be used as sources for investigations concerning the contamination.{{sfn|O'Connor|2001|p = 130}}}} Though Well 7 ran without chlorination between May 3 and May 9,{{sfn|O'Connor|2001|p = 130}} expert evaluation of well 7's pumping schedule and lack of physical vulnerabilities to contamination concluded that it was highly unlikely to have been involved in the outbreak. Well 6, which records indicate was out of service beginning May 13,{{sfn|O'Connor|2001|pp = 146–154}} was similarly determined to have been unlikely to have been the source of contamination based on its location and characteristics.{{sfn|O'Connor|2001|pp = 143–147}}

===Source of contamination===
To the immediate south and west of Well 5 lay farmland used as a cattle-breeding operation, occupying four lots (18–21, west to east). On April 22, 2000, following heavy rainfall on April 20–21, manure from the cattle was used to fertilize crops growing on lot 20 of the property, the nearest edge of which lay approximately {{convert|81|m|ft}} from Well 5. The manure was subsequently incorporated into the soil of lot 20 using a [[disc harrow]].{{sfn|O'Connor|2001|pp = 126–129}}

The April incorporation of ''E. coli''-contaminated manure into cool, wet soil near Well 5 meant that the bacteria were in an ideally suited environment for longevity.{{sfn|O'Connor|2001|pp = 126–129}} Subsequent heavy rains totalling {{convert|134|mm|in}} fell between May 8 and May 12, drawing the bacteria deeper into the soil near Well 5.{{sfn|O'Connor|2001|pp = 132–133}} During later investigations of the outbreak, experts on the Walkerton Commission Expert Review Panel determined that the manure-contaminated water had likely seeped into the aquifer that underlay Well 5, though it may have been possible that surface runoff, rather than contaminated groundwater, was the source of the bacteria.{{sfn|O'Connor|2001|pp = 143–147}}

Cattle manure, even under best practices, typically contains fecal coliform bacteria, including ''E. coli''. A subsequent government report concluded that the cattle operation had followed all safety and husbandry best practices with regard to manure storage and use, and that though the ''E. coli'' contamination had almost certainly come from the farm's manure usage, the farm's operator was not at fault for contamination of the well.{{sfn|O'Connor|2001|pp = 126–129}}

==Outbreak==
Beginning May 17, 2000, absenteeism in the Walkerton school system took an upswing. That day, the Walkerton Hospital treated seven children suffering from gastrointestinal ailments involving cramping and diarrhea. The illnesses were not initially recognized as part of a pattern, and no report was made to the [[Bruce-Grey-Owen-Sound Health Unit]],{{sfn|Bruce-Grey-Owen-Sound Health Unit|2000|pp=4–7}} which was responsible for public health in Grey and Bruce counties.&lt;ref name="GB About Us"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.publichealthgreybruce.on.ca/HOME/Misc/AboutUs.htm | title=About Us | publisher=Bruce-Grey-Owen-Sound Health Unit | work=publichealthgreybruce.on.ca | accessdate=December 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 18, twenty students were absent from the Mother Theresa School in Walkerton; the next day, twenty-five were, with a further four sent home from Mother Theresa and eight sent home from the Walkerton Public School.{{sfn|O'Connor|2001|pp = 7–13}} The increasing number of community illnesses became even more noticeable on May 19, when a pediatrician{{sfn|O'Connor|2001|pp = 7–13}} and a retirement home{{sfn|Bruce-Grey-Owen-Sound Health Unit|2000|pp=4–7}} both reported outbreaks of gastroenteritis among their charges. By May 20, the Walkerton hospital had fielded calls from more than a hundred people about incidences of gastroenteritis in the town, and attended to dozens more in their Emergency Department.{{sfn|O'Connor|2001|pp = 73–79}} Attending physicians and health care workers, aware that the gastroenteritis symptoms they were seeing were consistent with possible ''E. coli'' infection, began collecting stool samples from affected patients.{{sfn|O'Connor|2001|pp = 7–13}}

When public health officials put together common reports, they found that three area hospitals had recorded incidences of patients suffering from gastroenteritis symptoms. Walkerton's hospital recorded the highest number of such patients, with at least twenty patients visiting the emergency department with bloody diarrhea on May 20, and two more patients admitted for diarrhea-connected dehydration. Hospitals in two neighbouring towns had each seen one case of bloody diarrhea.{{sfn|Bruce-Grey-Owen-Sound Health Unit|2000|pp = 5}}

===Initial public health response===
On May 20, early laboratory testing was completed on fecal samples submitted the day before. [[E. coli O157|''E. coli'' O157]] was found in at least one sample from the Owen Sound Hospital; when health officials contacted other hospitals in the Bruce-Grey system, they found that all were handling patients with gastrointestinal ailments consistent with ''E. coli'' infection.{{sfn|Bruce-Grey-Owen-Sound Health Unit|2000|pp=4–7}} Potential ''E. coli'' infection changed the treatment plan for patients reporting to these hospitals or to local doctors; [[Diarrhea#Medications|anti-motility medication]] that would typically be prescribed to patients suffering from diarrhea unrelated to ''E. coli'' could in fact exacerbate the condition of patients whose diarrhea was due to ''E. coli'' infection, and any patient infected with ''E. coli'' O157 was at risk for potentially fatal [[hemolytic-uremic syndrome]].{{sfn|O'Connor|2001|pp = 73–79}}

David Patterson, the Assistant Director of Health Protection at Bruce-Grey-Owen-Sound Health Unit (BGOSHU), immediately contacted Beverly Middleton, a public health inspector in the Owen Sound office of the Health Unit, and the two officials began passing along information to local medical facilities about how to properly treat ''E. coli''-based gastroenteritis. Later the same day, Patterson asked James Schmidt, Middleton's counterpart in the Walkerton Health Unit, to contact the PUC and obtain information on chlorination levels in the water system. Stan Koebel informed Schmidt that chlorine residuals in the distribution system were 0.1 to 0.4 parts per million; based on lack of familiarity with water chlorination, Patterson concluded that the presence of chlorine residuals at any level indicated that the water system was free of contamination. He proceeded with investigating other possible sources for the ''E. coli''. Throughout May 20, Patterson expressed his understanding to community members and other investigators that Walkerton's water could not be the source of the outbreak;{{sfn|O'Connor|2001|pp = 73–79}} BGOSHU personnel also urged the PUC to issue a press release assuring the public of the safety of the water.{{sfn|Bruce-Grey-Owen-Sound Health Unit|2000|pp = 5}}

===Initial Public Utilities Commission response===
By May 18, rumours were already circulating that Walkerton PUC water was the cause of the illness increasing numbers of residents were suffering.{{sfn|Bruce-Grey-Owen-Sound Health Unit|2000|pp=4–7}} Staff at the PUC had also begun receiving calls enquiring as to the safety of town water.{{sfn|Bruce-Grey-Owen-Sound Health Unit|2000|pp=4–7}} On May 19, public health officials contacted the Walkerton PUC about the possibility of the water system being involved in transmission of the gastroenteritis; they were told that the town's drinking water was "okay".{{sfn|Bruce-Grey-Owen-Sound Health Unit|2000|pp=4–7}} After speaking to public health officials that day, Stan Koebel began the process of flushing the system and increasing chlorination levels, procedures he described to David Patterson as "precautionary".{{sfn|O'Connor|2001|pp = 67–73}} This flushing continued into May 20; Koebel's testing records from that day note sharply increased chlorine residual levels, though evidence later indicated that Koebel's testing had likely been done improperly and thus returned higher-than-reality chlorination results. The same day, Koebel returned Well 5, which had not been feeding Walkerton's water supply since May 15, to service.{{sfn|O'Connor|2001|pp = 73–79}} The well was then turned off at 1:15&amp;nbsp;a.m. on May 21.{{sfn|O'Connor|2001|pp = 79–88}}

Chief Justice of Ontario [[Dennis O'Connor (judge)|Dennis O'Connor]]'s later report on the event concluded that by May 19, Koebel was aware that the May 15 testing of water in the Walkerton system had returned results that indicated contamination, and his action to flush the system with heavily chlorinated water from Well 7 on May 19 was taken in the hopes of eradicating the contamination before further tests could be conducted. Significantly, Koebel did not disclose to the health inspectors to whom he spoke on May 19{{sfn|O'Connor|2001|pp = 67–73}} or May 20{{sfn|O'Connor|2001|pp = 73–79}} any information about known adverse test results or the fact that he knew Well 7 had been providing unchlorinated water to the system from May 15 to May 19. O'Connor's report interpreted this not as an act of accidental omission, but as a deliberate attempt by Koebel to conceal what he knew to be substandard and potentially unsafe practices in his department.{{sfn|O'Connor|2001|pp = 67–73}} At the same time, however, Koebel continued to consume PUC-served water and allow his family to do the same with no apparent concern about its safety; O'Connor concluded that while Koebel knew the system was contaminated, he did not understand that the ''E. coli'' bacteria causing the contamination were potentially deadly.{{sfn|O'Connor|2001|pp = 67–73}}

On May 20, Robert McKay, a PUC employee who was on medical leave at the time, anonymously contacted the Ministry of the Environment's Spills Action Centre (SAC) to report potential issues with the Walkerton water supply; after observing fire hydrants being used for system flushing, he had concluded that the flushing may have been related to the ongoing illness outbreak in the community and felt that he needed to report his conclusion. McKay also reported to the SAC that Walkerton water had failed "lab tests", but he was unable to provide detail about what aspect of the water quality had caused the failure. Later in the day on May 20, McKay attempted to contact the Ministry of Health directly about his suspicions, but was unable to get in contact with anyone empowered to handle issues in Walkerton; hoping to speed up government response time, he phoned the SAC again to report his knowledge that the Walkerton PUC was using an "unlicensed operator".{{sfn|O'Connor|2001|pp = 73–79}}

SAC employees, in response to this information, contacted the Walkerton PUC the same day for information on possible adverse water testing results. Stan Koebel acknowledged to the MOE that "we've had the odd [adverse sample]" due to previous construction work{{sfn|O'Connor|2001|pp = 73–79}} but that the system flushing was occurring only as "a precaution".{{sfn|O'Connor|2001|pp = 73–79}} The MOE employee who spoke to Koebel believed that this meant any adverse samples of Walkerton water were in the past, and filed his subsequent report of the conversation accordingly; Koebel had again failed to note that he was aware of current test results that showed evidence of ''E. coli'' and fecal coliforms.{{sfn|O'Connor|2001|pp = 73–79}}

==Controlling the outbreak==
===Events of May 21===
Morning news reports on public radio on May 21 carried a statement by Dr. Murray McQuigge, Walkerton's Medical Officer of Health, reflecting medical investigators' then-current understanding that Walkerton's water system was presumed to be secure and not involved in the outbreak. McQuigge's quoted opinion also characterized ''E. coli'' as "unlikely" to be the source of the gastroenteritis outbreak.{{sfn|O'Connor|2001|pp = 79–88}}

By 12 p.m.{{sfn|O'Connor|2001|pp = 79–88}} on May 21, however, laboratory results had confirmed enough cases of ''E. coli'' O157 in area gastroenteritis patients to merit a declaration by the Bruce-Grey-Owen-Sound Health Unit that an infective outbreak existed and was being caused by ''E. coli'' O157 contamination somewhere. The Health Unit issued an outbreak number and alerted neighbouring health units of its situation, as well as notifying a variety of Walkerton-centred government and management bodies, including the Walkerton PUC.1.{{sfn|Bruce-Grey-Owen-Sound Health Unit|2000|pp = 5–6}}

Shortly after the definitive laboratory results were received, McQuigge, representing BGOSHU, contacted David Thompson, the mayor of Brockton, Walkerton's parent municipality. According to McQuigge, the conversation involved McQuigge alerting Thompson to the fact that that community members were falling ill with potentially fatal ''E. coli'' infections; according to Thompson, ''E. coli'' was not mentioned in the conversation and he was left with the impression that the illnesses presented no imminent threat to public health. Despite their conflicting memories of the conversation, both McQuigge's and Thompson's later testimonies agreed that there had been no request issued that the mayor take action in response to the illnesses; Brockton's emergency plan was not put into action, and Thompson did not contact any public agencies to seek either information or action.{{sfn|O'Connor|2001|pp = 79–88}}

Given that the outbreak was continuing and that no reliable information was yet available about the source of the contamination, the BGOSHU issued a cautionary Boil Water Advisory (BWA) to the community, to be distributed via local radio stations only.{{sfn|Bruce-Grey-Owen-Sound Health Unit|2000|pp = 5–6}} Local television stations were not contacted about the advisory, nor was national [[CBC Radio]]; no paper version of the advisory was distributed to the community that day. Local radio station [[CKNX-FM]], under the impression that the BWA was cautionary only, reported the advisory at roughly hourly intervals, beginning at 1:30&amp;nbsp;p.m., rather than more rapidly as they later stated they might have if the import of the announcement had been made clear to them at the time. As a result of the limited distribution of information regarding the BWA, much of the community remained unaware of the Boil Water Advisory until days after its May 21 issuance.{{sfn|Bruce-Grey-Owen-Sound Health Unit|2000|pp = 5–6}}

Around the time the BWA was first being broadcast, David Patterson contacted the MOE's Spills Action Centre (SAC) to officially report an ''E. coli'' outbreak in Walkerton. Paul Webb, the SAC employee taking Patterson's phone call, mentioned that they had previously been contacted by an anonymous source (Robert McKay) about the quality of water coming out of the Walkerton PUC. The men discussed the PUC's assurances that their water was safe, and the call ended with no action. Shortly afterward, however, Patterson contacted Stan Koebel at the Walkerton PUC again. Koebel expressed dismay at the Boil Water Advisory and the fact that the PUC had not been notified of it beforehand. He asked Patterson's advice for the best next steps to take; Patterson suggested increasing chlorination levels in the system.{{sfn|Bruce-Grey-Owen-Sound Health Unit|2000|pp = 5–6}}

The same afternoon, the Spills Action Centre contacted Stan Koebel directly to discuss the ongoing events; Koebel once again failed to mention prior known adverse testing results. In later testimony, he acknowledged that this had been a deliberate omission; the O'Connor report concluded that Koebel had been hoping that when new samples were collected on May 23, they would test clean and lift the burden from his shoulders.{{sfn|Bruce-Grey-Owen-Sound Health Unit|2000|pp = 5–6}} Stan and Frank Koebel again spent part of their day on May 21 flushing the system.{{sfn|O'Connor|2001|pp = 79–88}}

At 2:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. on May 21, the BGOSHU convened a strategic response team to handle the outbreak. After discussion, the team decided to directly notify at-risk or involved institutions, including hospitals, of the Boil Water Advisory. The Walkerton hospital received its notification at 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. that day. Prior to this, and despite numerous contacts with BGOSHU staff, hospital personnel had not been aware of potential danger from Walkerton water; in some cases hospital personnel had been told specifically that water was ''not'' the cause of the outbreak.{{sfn|O'Connor|2001|pp = 79–88}}

The Ministry of the Environment nominally received notification of the outbreak from a message left on the home answering machine of employee Philip Bye. Bye, however, did not recognize the significance of ''E. coli'' being present in Walkerton water and, believing the measures public health officials had already taken to be sufficient to deal with the contamination, he did not pass the news on to the emergency response arm of the MOE that day.{{sfn|O'Connor|2001|pp = 79–88}}

In the face of rising community casualties—by the evening of May 21, 270 people had contacted the Walkerton hospital after experiencing gastroenteritis symptoms, and one patient had had to be airlifted to [[London, Ontario]] for treatment—the situation was being perceived as increasingly serious by most of those involved. That evening, the BGOSHU contacted the Minister of Health and the Chief Medical Officer of Health of Ontario. Requests were placed with the Ministry of Health for an [[epidemiology|epidemiologist]] and for staff to assist in treating Walkerton-region gastroenteritis patients; public health staff began looking into acquiring equipment that would be needed to treat any ''E. coli'' patients whose infections progressed to Hemolytic-Uremic Syndrome (HUS).{{sfn|O'Connor|2001|pp = 79–88}}

David Patterson ordered further testing of Walkerton's water, sending James Schmidt to collect samples of water from various sources in Walkerton, including "food premises, hospitals, and the health unit office".{{sfn|O'Connor|2001|pp = 79–88}} Patterson received Schmidt's collected samples and drove them to London overnight.{{sfn|O'Connor|2001|pp = 79–88}} The samples were received by the London Regional Public Health Laboratory at 12:45&amp;nbsp;a.m. on May 22; a further round of sampling was ordered to be done the next day.{{sfn|Bruce-Grey-Owen-Sound Health Unit|2000|pp = 5–6}}
&lt;!--By May 21, James Kieffer, chair of the PUC, had heard of the gastroenteritis outbreak; he contacted Stan Koebel for information and was told that the system was being flushed. Kieffer and his family continued to consume PUC water.{{sfn|O'Connor|2001|pp = 79-88}} --&gt;

===Events of May 22===
Despite increased awareness of the severity of the outbreak, as May 22 began, some links in the public safety chain were still uninformed as to either the existence of the outbreak or the fact that it presented a real and present danger to public health. Mayor David Thompson, himself suffering from symptoms of gastroenteritis, which he assumed to be [[influenza|flu]], took no investigatory or emergency-preparedness action on May 22, nor did James Kieffer, chair of the PUC, who had been alerted to the outbreak the day before. MOE employee Philip Bye, who had been notified by BGOSHU phone call the previous evening, did not understand that ''E. coli'' contamination was a life-threatening emergency; he took no action until he was contacted again later on May 22 by a concerned Dr. McQuigge. At that point, Bye sent an environmental officer to join the investigation in Walkerton.{{sfn|O'Connor|2001|pp = 88–92}}

The MOE environmental officer dispatched by Bye, John Earl, spoke first to David Patterson, who expressed his growing suspicion that Walkerton PUC water was the source of the contamination; Patterson asked Earl to obtain further information and records from Stan Koebel. Koebel, in his verbal interview with Earl, failed again to provide information about adverse water testing results and other potentially crucial system information; he informed Earl that Well 7 has had a new chlorinator installed, for example, but omitted mention that this had been after the well had pumped unchlorinated water into the system for days. Earl requested and was given documentation regarding well testing, water distribution maps, and pumping history for the wells. Included in this documentation were records of the May 17 adverse testing results of May 15 samples from the "Highway 9" water main construction; excluded was pumping history for Well 7. Earl returned to the MOE with these documents and reviewed them, noting the May 17 testing results, but notified no one else of these results.{{sfn|O'Connor|2001|pp = 88–92}}

After Earl left the PUC, Stan Koebel contacted his brother Frank to ask him to "clean up"{{sfn|O'Connor|2001|pp = 92–97}} the pumping log for Well 7. Stan Koebel hoped to have a new document to present to Earl the next day that would not reflect that Well 7 had been unattended to and unchlorinated. Frank Koebel complied with this request. He destroyed the previous version of the document and created a new one with fictitious data: the new document showed Well 7 as not having operated on the days it had actually been pumping unchlorinated water into the system, and contained chlorine residual records for Well 7 which were entirely fictitious.{{sfn|O'Connor|2001|pp = 92–97}} Frank Koebel later testified that he had falsified this document "so it would look better to the MOE".{{sfn|O'Connor|2001|pp = 92–97}}

While the Ministry of the Environment investigated the outbreak from the procedural end, public health officials swung into a medical investigation. Early epidemiological investigation had demonstrated fairly strongly that infection risk seemed to correlate to physical presence in Walkerton—even for patients visiting other area hospitals, investigators typically found that the patient lived in or had visited Walkerton during the period of their infection—{{sfn|Bruce-Grey-Owen-Sound Health Unit|2000|pp = 5}} and investigators now began making telephone calls to patients, gathering information about onset of symptoms, possible methods of exposure, and the patients' personal demographic information.{{sfn|Bruce-Grey-Owen-Sound Health Unit|2000|pp = 6–7}}

A compilation of data from this secondary investigation demonstrated that most patients had an onset of symptoms within a fairly narrow window of time, with the highest rate of onset occurring on May 17. Taking into account the incubation period of ''E. coli'' infection, the medical team determined that most patients had been exposed to the pathogen between May 12 and May 14.{{sfn|O'Connor|2001|pp = 88–92}}  Investigators had less luck trying to pinpoint a physical source of the infection; when affected patients' residences were mapped, their distribution across a map of Walkerton showed no immediately apparent pattern,{{sfn|Bruce-Grey-Owen-Sound Health Unit|2000|pp = 6–7}} with affected populations present in all areas served by Walkerton's water system.{{sfn|O'Connor|2001|pp = 88–92}}

By that evening, public health investigators had concluded based on patient interviews and demographic mapping that the water system was the most likely vector of infection, despite their not being aware of the corroborating documents that John Earl had collected.{{sfn|O'Connor|2001|pp = 88–92}} They began notifying branch offices of the BGOSHU of the outbreak and its cause.{{sfn|Bruce-Grey-Owen-Sound Health Unit|2000|pp = 6–7}}

===Events of May 23 and 24===
The BGOSHU's May 22 presumptive conclusion about Walkerton's water was confirmed at 8:45 the following morning, when the London Regional Public Health Laboratory reported testing results on the water Schmidt had collected on May 21 and 22: both ''E. coli'' and fecal coliform results had come back positive on the May 21 samples, and though testing was not complete on the May 22 samples, evidence of coliform growth was already apparent.{{sfn|O'Connor|2001|pp = 92–97}}{{sfn|Bruce-Grey-Owen-Sound Health Unit|2000|p = 7}}

John Earl returned to the PUC that morning to continue his investigation. Stan Koebel gave him the Well 7-related documents that he and Frank Koebel had falsified, and Earl began to analyse the documentation he had collected over the past few days. He noted apparent irregularities in the pumping histories of all three wells, as well as unlikely chlorination levels recorded for Well 5. He communicated these irregularities to the MOE's Philip Bye, but neither man reported them outside of his own organization.{{sfn|O'Connor|2001|pp = 92–97}}

At 9:45 on the morning of May 23, David Patterson contacted Stan Koebel at the Walkerton PUC and informed him of the May 21 test results. Koebel, realizing that his attempts to clean the system beginning May 19 had not been sufficient, confessed to Patterson that he had been aware of the contamination of Walkerton water since May 17. Koebel was reportedly "distraught"{{sfn|O'Connor|2001|pp = 92–97}} at this point in the conversation. After ending his call with Koebel, Patterson immediately passed on the information about the May 15 test results to the chairman of the Board of Health and to Murray McQuigge, the local Medical Officer of Health.{{sfn|O'Connor|2001|pp = 92–97}}

Shortly after 11 a.m., a press conference was held at the Walkerton hospital. Led by McQuigge and attended by hospital staff, BGOSHU staff, and the media, this press conference was the first reliable report to the public of the existence and causes of an ''E. coli'' outbreak in the community.{{sfn|O'Connor|2001|pp = 92–97}}{{sfn|Bruce-Grey-Owen-Sound Health Unit|2000|p = 7}}

The Walkerton hospital hosted a roundtable at 1 p.m. the same day to inform local physicians of proper treatment for [[Escherichia coli O157:H7|''E. coli'' O157:H7]]-associated gastroenteritis, especially with regard to infected children, who were at increased risk for renal failure due to Hemolytic-Uremic Syndrome.{{sfn|Bruce-Grey-Owen-Sound Health Unit|2000|p = 7}} Shortly thereafter, BGOSHU staff met with the Brockton city council in the council's chambers. This meeting was attended by representatives from the Ministry of the Environment and the Public Utilities Commission as well as of BGOSHU and the city council. The attendees of the meeting reviewed what was known thus far about the timeline of the outbreak, discussed what steps could be taken going forward, and attempted to analyse the adequacy of their response to the crisis thus far. MOE representative Philip Bye announced that the MOE would be investigating the ways in which Walkerton's water system could have become the cause of the outbreak. McQuigge, in response to questions, asserted that he did not believe the public could have been notified with a Boil Water Advisory any earlier than they were; prior to May 21, neither the distribution of hospital admissions nor then-current testing results supported publicly declaring a problem in Walkerton.{{sfn|O'Connor|2001|pp = 92–97}}

The meeting became heated, with McQuigge urging Stan Koebel to "come clean", Koebel refusing to disclose adverse test results, and McQuigge and Mayor Thompson exchanging confrontational words as the meeting broke up. McQuigge later claimed that he had urged Thompson to "tell the public what you know"; Thompson alleged that McQuigge had threatened him if he "bl[e]w the whistle on me or Brockton".{{sfn|O'Connor|2001|pp = 92–97}}

Later in the afternoon, Thompson and the council convened a private meeting without BHOSHU staff to decide their next steps. Stan Koebel told meeting participants that testing had shown bacteriological issues in Wells 5 and 7; though he allowed that Well 7's chlorinator had not been functioning properly, he did not disclose that Well 7 had in fact been operating without any chlorinator at all. With the input of Koebel and Steve Burns, an engineer with the Highway 9 project's consulting firm, it was decided that Burns's firm would develop an action plan to remediate the water contamination. On the basis of this remediation plan, meeting participants decided that it would not be necessary to declare a state of emergency in Walkerton.{{sfn|O'Connor|2001|pp = 92–97}}

Despite this declaration, publicizing of the epidemic, and the Boil Water Advisory, local hospitals continued to treat gastroenteritis patients  during the last week of May at numbers more than double typical ER throughput. Hospital staff were forced to take emergency measures, with elective and deferrable treatments redirected to other hospitals and out-of-town medical staff being pressed into service. By May 24, there had been four patient deaths and the Walkerton hospital and the BGOSHU were playing host to three epidemiologists from various arms of [[Health Canada]].{{sfn|O'Connor|2001|pp = 97–102}} 27 people had developed [[Hemolytic-uremic syndrome|HUS]], a serious and potentially deadly complication of ''E. coli'' infection.{{sfn|Bruce-Grey-Owen-Sound Health Unit|2000|pp = 5}} The full death toll for the outbreak was initially reported as seven, but later revised to six.&lt;ref name="CBCDeathToll"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/walkerton-death-toll-revised-1.204075 | title=Walkerton death toll revised | publisher=CBC News | date=26 July 2000 | accessdate= 26 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
While the community attempted to recover from the events of May 2000, anger and blame ran high. On May 25, Murray McQuigge had made a public statement saying that in his opinion, dissemination of information to the community had been hampered by lack of disclosure of adverse PUC testing results, and patient deaths could have been prevented had disclosure been made earlier;{{refn|group=note|McQuigge later retracted this statement, feeling that while the number of infections may have been reduced by earlier disclosure, the death toll was not likely to have been.{{sfn|O'Connor|2001|pp = 97–102}}}}{{sfn|O'Connor|2001|pp = 97–102}} by May 29, a $1 billion class-action lawsuit&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-62411510.html | title=Tainted water raises safety issues: As number of illnesses subsides, questions focus on why public officials withheld information. | work=[[The Christian Science Monitor]] | date=30 May 2000 | accessdate=August 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; had been filed by community members similarly alleging that local officials had failed in their duty to notify the community.&lt;ref name="APOntarioWaterTestRegs"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-30885432.html | title=Ontario Water Test Regs Unveiled | work={{Subscription required|via=HighBeam}} | date=29 May 2000 | agency=[[The Associated Press]] | accessdate=August 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Authorities from the [[Ontario Clean Water Agency]] took over operations at the Walkerton Public Utilities Commission on May 25 at the request of Mayor Thomson.&lt;ref name="APOntarioCopsProbe"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-30883515.html | author= Cohen, Tom | title=Ontario Cops Probe E. Coli Outbreak | publisher=[[The Associated Press]] | work=AP Online {{Subscription required|via=HighBeam}} | date=26 May 2000 | accessdate=August 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next day, the [[Ontario Provincial Police]] launched an investigation into the causes of the outbreak,&lt;ref name="APOntarioCopsProbe"/&gt; followed within days by a coroner's inquest and an environmental investigation.&lt;ref name="CharlestonGazAbates"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-18568444.html | title=E. coli crisis abates, but blame intensifies | work=[[The Charleston Gazette]] | date=28 May 2000 | agency=[[The Associated Press]] | accessdate=26 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the outbreak, both Stan and Frank Koebel denied any wrongdoing and firmly held that the water at Walkerton was safe to drink. However, as the outbreak grew in severity the two were eventually part of the criminal investigation into the incident, and, as a result, both would eventually plead guilty to a charge of [[nuisance|common nuisance]] through a [[plea bargain]]. In their plea, they admitted to falsifying reports and Frank admitted to drinking on the job, as a beer fridge did exist at the facility.&lt;ref name="CBC-in-depth"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/walkerton/ |publisher=CBC News |title=Inside Walkerton: Ontario's rural heartland in shock |date=May 1, 2000 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041023231617/http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/walkerton/ |archivedate=October 23, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They were both formally sentenced on December 21, 2004, with Stan receiving one year in jail and Frank Koebel nine months of house arrest.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} Reaction to their sentencing was mixed.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

The [[Ontario Clean Water Agency]] was put in charge of the cleanup of Walkerton's water system after the outbreak.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

An inquiry, known as the Walkerton Commission led by [[Court of Appeal for Ontario]] Associate Chief Justice [[Dennis O'Connor (judge)|Dennis O'Connor]], wrote a two-part report in 2002.  '''Part 1''' was released in January 2002.&lt;ref name="Walkerton-part-1"&gt;[https://www.archives.gov.on.ca/en/e_records/walkerton/report1/index.html#full Walkerton Report, Part 1. January 2002]&lt;/ref&gt; The Walkerton Report, Part One, described events in the community and a series of failures, both human and systemic, that led to contamination of the water supply. The report made recommendations based on the circumstances of the outbreak.  It estimated that the Walkerton water contamination cost a minimum of [[Canadian dollar|C$]]64.5–155 million and laid much of the blame at the door of the Walkerton Public Utilities Commission:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The Walkerton Public Utilities Commission operators engaged in a host of improper operating practices, including failing to use adequate doses of [[chlorine]], failing to monitor chlorine residuals daily, making false entries about residuals in daily operating records, and misstating the locations at which [[Microbiology|microbiological]] samples were taken. The operators knew that these practices were unacceptable and contrary to [[Ministry of the Environment (Ontario)|Ministry of Environment]] guidelines and directives.&lt;ref name="Walkerton-part-1"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Ontario government of [[Mike Harris]] was also blamed for not regulating water quality and not enforcing the guidelines that had been in place. The water testing had been [[Privatization|privatized]] in October 1996.&lt;ref name="Walkerton-part-2"/&gt;

'''Part 2''' of the report made many recommendations for improving the quality of water and public health in Ontario.&lt;ref name="Walkerton-part-2"&gt;[https://www.archives.gov.on.ca/en/e_records/walkerton/report2/index.html Walkerton Report, "Part 2: Report of the Walkerton Inquiry: A Strategy for Safe Drinking Water" May 2002]&lt;/ref&gt; Part Two discussed water safety across the province and the steps needed to prevent similar tragedies. It made ninety-three recommendations.  All of its recommendations have been accepted by succeeding governments of the province. The recommendations have also influenced provincial policies across Canada.

Key recommendations touched on [[source water protection]] as part of a comprehensive [[multi-barrier approach]], the training and certification of operators, a quality management system for water suppliers, and more competent enforcement. In Ontario, these requirements have been incorporated into new legislation.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

===Contributing causes===
; Physical
* Well 5: shallow depth of the well, its being surrounded by fractured bedrock, and its physical location near a source of cattle manure runoff all contributed to Well 5 being unusually susceptible to contamination{{sfn|O'Connor|2001|p = 105}}

; Chemical
*  Inadequate chlorination of Well 5's water (as well as water throughout the Walkerton PUC system) meant that, once it was contaminated by bacteria such as ''e. coli'', it remained so.{{sfn|O'Connor|2001|p = 105}}

; Organizational negligence
* Public Utility Commission staff:
:*Inadequate training and continuing education among staff of the Walkerton PUC meant that those responsible for the safety of the area's water were not equipped to make informed decisions in this area
:*The Walkerton PUC had a long-term history of failing to abide by the minimum water testing and treatment requirements
:**Inadequate monitoring of system water: PUC staff regularly collected fewer samples than required, and collected them from improper areas of the system. Both of these practices were known to potentially lead to false-negative contamination results.{{sfn|O'Connor|2001|pp = 188–189}} Similarly, PUC staff generally failed to perform chlorine residual monitoring tests as often as necessary, and often performed them improperly when they did perform them.{{sfn|O'Connor|2001|pp = 194–195}}
:**Improper chlorination: Though the Ministry of the Environment had repeatedly reminded the PUC of the importance of maintaining the system at a 0.5 mg/L chlorine residual after 15 minutes, PUC staff relied on their personal judgment that this standard was unnecessary due to the water's inherent quality and chose to chlorinate the system to a lesser level, partially in response to community complaints that the system's water tasted of chlorine.{{sfn|O'Connor|2001|pp = 192–194}}

* Public Utility Commissioners (two elected, one the town's mayor serving ''ex oficio''):
:*Public Utilities Commissioners should have been responsible for hiring and maintaining informed and capable PUC staff, beginning with senior management;{{sfn|O'Connor|2001|pp = 221–224}} this was neglected in Walkerton, as the commissioners felt that their responsibilities encompassed only "budgeting and financial aspects of the operation".{{sfn|O'Connor|2001|pp = 224–227}}
:*Commissioners relied on PUC manager Stan Koebel to make policy and inform the Commission of water quality-related events of interest, even when commissioners were or should have been aware of such information and responsible for policy-setting. Commissioners also failed to review whether Koebel was performing these aspects of his job adequately.{{sfn|O'Connor|2001|pp = 224–227}}
:*Commissioners were offered no education on the topic of water safety, and none was required of them in order to be elected or to serve. Commissioners typically did not consider this knowledge a requirement for doing their jobs, even when they had access to relevant resources.{{sfn|O'Connor|2001|pp = 224–227}}

; Negligence by individuals
*Falsification of reports: PUC staff regularly entered chlorine residual results on log sheets that did not reflect actual testing results or that represented testing that had never been performed at all.{{sfn|O'Connor|2001|pp = 195–197}}
*Stan Koebel, general manager of the Walkerton PUC:
**Koebel knowingly failed to notify the Bruce-Grey-Owen-Sound Health Unit when he became aware on May 15 that water from his system was heavily contaminated.{{sfn|O'Connor|2001|pp = 182–183}} 
**Prior to public health investigators determining that the water system was a likely cause of the outbreak, Koebel communicated to the Health Unit the false impression that the water system had been checked and was safe.{{sfn|O'Connor|2001|pp = 182–183}}

==In media==
The lessons learned from this incident were described by [[Kim Vicente]] in his book ''[[The Human Factor: Revolutionizing the Way People Live with Technology|The Human Factor]]''.

A 2005 [[CBC Television]] [[docudrama]] called ''Betrayed'' was based loosely upon the Walkerton ''E. coli'' outbreak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/betrayed-by-reality-tv/article1334047/|title=Betrayed by reality TV|publisher=|date=April 18, 2018|via=The Globe and Mail|author=Doyle, John}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 11, 2018 the ''Toronto Star'' reported that Robbie Schnurr had doctors assist him in committing suicide due to suffering caused by the outbreak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2018/05/11/in-2000-walkertons-poisoned-water-ruined-his-life-he-decided-it-was-time-to-end-it.html|title=In 2000, Walkerton’s poisoned water ruined his life.
