His pageant shield leans against the tree. The Queen's "favour", a glove, is attached to his hat.]]
The '''Accession Day tilts''' were a series of elaborate festivities held annually at the court of [[Elizabeth I of England]] to celebrate her [[Accession Day]], 17&amp;nbsp;November, also known as Queen's Day.&lt;ref&gt;which was elevated into a [[Protestant]] [[feast day]] by adding it to the [[Anglican]] [[Church calendar]]: "All over England the Queen's subjects expressed their joy in her Government by prayers and sermons, bell-ringing, bonfires and feasting", notes Roy C. Strong, "The Popular Celebration of the Accession Day of Queen Elizabeth I" ''Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes'' '''21'''.1/2 (January 1958:86-103) p 87; see also, whereon sttod a [[Lion and Unicorn|lyon and a dragon]], supporters Strong (1984):19 and Hutton 1994:146-151&lt;/ref&gt;  The tilts combined [[theatre|theatrical]] elements with [[jousting]], in which Elizabeth's [[courtier]]s competed to outdo each other in [[allegory|allegorical]] [[armour]] and [[costume]], [[poetry]], and [[Medieval pageant|pageant]]ry to exalt the queen and her realm of [[England]].&lt;ref name="A"&gt;Strong 1977, p. 129-133&lt;/ref&gt;

The last Elizabethan Accession Day tilt was held in November 1602; the queen died the following spring.  Tilts continued as part of festivities marking the Accession Day of [[James I of England|James I]], 24&amp;nbsp;March, until 1624, the year before his death.&lt;ref&gt;Strong (1987):137-138; Young, p. 208&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
[[File:Henryleegarniture.jpg|thumb|left|The Greenwich garniture of [[Sir Henry Lee]], in the Jacob Album]]
Sir [[Henry Lee of Ditchley]], [[Queen's Champion]], devised the Accession Day tilts, which became the most important [[Elizabethan era|Elizabethan]] court festival from the 1580s.&lt;ref&gt;Festivities surrounding installations of the [[Order of the Garter]] were less frequent, less elaborate and less public.&lt;/ref&gt; The celebrations are likely to have begun somewhat informally in the early 1570s.&lt;ref name="A" /&gt; By 1581, the Queen's Day tilts "had been deliberately developed into a gigantic public spectacle eclipsing every other form of court festival", with thousands in attendance; the public were admitted for a small charge.&lt;ref&gt;Strong 1977, p. 133, &amp; 1984:51&lt;/ref&gt;  Lee himself oversaw the annual festivities until he retired as Queen's Champion at the tilt of 1590, handing over the role to [[George Clifford, 3rd Earl of Cumberland]].&lt;ref&gt;The ceremonial transfer is described in detail in Yates, p. 102-103&lt;/ref&gt;  Following Lee's retirement, orchestration of the tilts fell to the [[Edward Somerset, 4th Earl of Worcester|Earl of Worcester]] in his capacity of [[Master of Horse]] and to the queen's [[favourite]], the [[Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex|Earl of Essex]], although Lee remained as a sort of Master of Ceremonies at the request of the queen.&lt;ref&gt;Yates, p. 104&lt;/ref&gt;

The pageants were held at the [[tiltyard]] at the [[Palace of Whitehall]],&lt;ref&gt;except in 1593, when they were relocated to the grounds of [[Windsor Castle]] due to an outbreak of [[Plague (disease)|plague]] in [[London]]; see Young, p. 122, 169.&lt;/ref&gt; where the royal party viewed the festivities from the Tiltyard Gallery.  The [[Office of Works]] constructed a platform with staircases below the gallery to facilitate presentations to the queen.&lt;ref&gt;Young, p. 119-122&lt;/ref&gt;

===Knights===
Tilt lists for the Accession Day pageants have survived; these establish that the majority of the participating jousters came from the ranks of the Queen's [[Gentlemen Pensioners]].  Entrants included such powerful members of the court as the [[Francis Russell, 2nd Earl of Bedford|Earl of Bedford]], the [[Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford|Earl of Oxford]], the [[Henry Wriothesley, 3rd Earl of Southampton|Earl of Southampton]], Lord [[Charles Howard, 1st Earl of Nottingham|Howard of Effingham]],&lt;ref name="B" /&gt; and the Earl of Essex.&lt;ref name="Hutton"&gt;Hutton 1994, p. 146-151&lt;/ref&gt; Many of those participating had seen active service in Ireland or on the Continent, but the atmosphere of romance and entertainment seems to have predominated over the serious military exercises that were medieval tournaments.&lt;ref&gt;Strong (1984):51&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sir James Scudamore]], a knight who tilted in the 1595 tournament, was immortalized as "Sir Scudamour" in Book Four of ''[[The Faerie Queene]]'' by [[Edmund Spenser]].
[[File:Scudamorehelmet.jpg|thumb|[[Greenwich armour]] of [[Sir James Scudamore]], 1590s. Jousting was crucial to Scudamore's reputation at court.&lt;ref&gt;The armet shown was made by restorer Daniel Tachaux in 1915 to replace the missing original, and faithfully reproduces the style's distinctive high visor.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Knights participating in the spectacle entered in pageant cars or on horseback, disguised as some heroic, romantic, or [[metaphor]]ical figure, with their servants in [[fancy dress]] according to the theme of the entry.  A squire presented a [[Card stock|pasteboard]] pageant shield decorated with the character's [[Personal device|device]] or ''impresa'' to the Queen and explained the significance of his disguise in prose or poetry.&lt;ref name="B"&gt;Strong 1977, p. 135&lt;/ref&gt;  Entrants went to considerable expense to devise themes, order armour and costumes for their followers, and in some cases to hire poets or dramatists and even professional actors to carry out their programmes.  

Classical, [[pastoral]], and [[King Arthur|Arthurian]] settings were typically combined with story lines flattering to the queen, but serious subtexts were common, especially among those who used these occasions to express public contrition or desolation for having aroused the queen's displeasure, or to plead for royal favour.&lt;ref&gt;Young, p. 167-77&lt;/ref&gt; In the painting on the left, Essex wears black (sable) armour, which he wore as part of his 1590 entrance to the tilts.  At this particular tilt, Essex entered as the head of a funeral procession, carried on a bier by his attendants.  This was meant to atone for his failure to subdue Ireland, but Elizabeth was not impressed and did not forgive him readily.

===Poets===
Poets associated with court circles who wrote allegorical verses to accompany the knights' presentations include [[John Davies (poet)|John Davies]], [[Edward de Vere]], [[Philip Sidney]]&lt;ref&gt;'Two Songs for an Accession Day Tilt', in ''Sir Philip Sidney: The Major Works'', Oxford University Press, 2002, {{ISBN|0-19-284080-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the young [[Francis Bacon]], who composed speeches and helped stage presentations for his [[patron]], the Earl of Essex.&lt;ref&gt;'A Conference of Pleasure' (speeches composed for the Earl of Essex for the Queen’s Accession Day Tilt, 1594): 'In Praise of Knowledge', 'In Praise of Fortitude', 'In Praise of Love', 'In Praise of Truth'; 'The Device of the Indian Prince' (Speeches composed for the Earl of Essex for the Queen’s Accession Day Tilt, 1594): 'Squire', 'Hermit', 'Soldier', 'Statesman'.   [http://www.fbrt.org.uk/pages/essays/essay-dates.html Dates of Francis Bacon's works, retrieved 29 November 2007] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011022037/http://www.fbrt.org.uk/pages/essays/essay-dates.html |date=October 11, 2007 }}; and see Strong (1987), p. 137&lt;/ref&gt;  Sidney, in particular, as both poet and knight, embodied the [[chivalry|chivalric]] themes of the tilts; a remembrance of Sidney was part of the tilt programme of 1586, the year after his death.&lt;ref&gt;Yates, p.100&lt;/ref&gt; Sidney's friend and protégé [[Sir James Scudamore]], who would go on to be one of the primary competitors in the Accession Day tilt in 1595, carried the pennant of Sidney's arms at the age of eighteen.&lt;ref&gt;Atherton, Ian. Ambition and Failure in Stuart England: The Career of John, First Viscount Scudamore, Manchester University Press, 1999. p.34&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edmund Spenser]] wrote of ''[[The Faerie Queene]]'', which turns upon the Accession Day festivities as its fundamental structural device: "I devise that the Faery Queen kept her Annuall feast xii. days, upon which xii. severall days, the occasions of the xii. severall adventures hapned&lt;!--hapned in original--&gt;, which being undertaken by xii. severall knights, are in these xii. books severally handled and discoursed";&lt;ref&gt;Letter from Spenser to [[Sir Walter Raleigh]] quoted in Roy C. Strong 1958:86.&lt;/ref&gt;

==A visitor's account==
[[File:Armor Garniture of George Clifford (1558–1605), Third Earl of Cumberland MET DP295743.jpg|thumb|[[Greenwich armour]] of [[George Clifford, 3rd Earl of Cumberland]] (1558–1605), 1586.  This has a different design to that in the miniature by [[Nicholas Hilliard]] (at top).]]
The fullest straightforward account of a Tilt is by Lupold von Wedel, a German traveller who saw the 1584 celebrations:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Now approached the day, when on November 17 the tournament was to be held... About twelve o’clock the queen and her ladies placed themselves at the windows in a long room at Weithol [Whitehall] palace, near Westminster, opposite the barrier where the tournament was to be held. From this room a broad staircase led downwards, and round the barrier stands were arranged by boards above the ground, so that everybody by paying 12d. would get a stand and see the play... Many thousand spectators, men, women and girls, got places, not to speak of those who were within the barrier and paid nothing.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;During the whole time of the tournament all those who wished to fight entered the list by pairs, the trumpets being blown at the time and other musical instruments. The combatants had their servants clad in different colours, they, however, did not enter the barrier, but arranged themselves on both sides. Some of the servants were disguised like savages, or like Irishmen, with the hair hanging down to the girdle like women, others had horses equipped like elephants, some carriages were drawn by men, others appeared to move by themselves; altogether the carriages were very odd in appearance. Some gentlemen had their horses with them and mounted in full armour directly from the carriage. There were some who showed very good horsemanship and were also in fine attire. The manner of the combat each had settled before entering the lists. The costs amounted to several thousand pounds each.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;When a gentleman with his servants approached the barrier, on horseback or in a carriage, he stopped at the foot of the staircase leading to the queen’s room, while one of his servants in pompous attire of a special pattern mounted the steps and addressed the queen in well-composed verses or with a ludicrous speech, making her and her ladies laugh. When the speech was ended he in the name of his lord offered to the queen a costly present.. .Now always two by two rode against each other, breaking lances across the beam.. . The fête lasted until five o’clock in the afternoon...&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shafe.co.uk/art/Tudor_13_-_Tournaments_and_Royal_Progresses.asp SHAFE] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081203170842/http://www.shafe.co.uk/art/Tudor_13_-_Tournaments_and_Royal_Progresses.asp |date=December 3, 2008 }} Transactions of the Royal Historical Society, New Series IX (1895)pp. 258-9, quoted Strong, 1984, Yates ''Astrea'' etc&lt;/ref&gt;  &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The '''Ancient Monuments Society''' (AMS) is a [[learned society]] and [[Charitable organization#Charity registration|registered charity]] in England and Wales,&lt;ref&gt;{{EW charity|209605}}&lt;/ref&gt; founded in 1924 "for the study and conservation of ancient monuments, historic buildings and fine old craftsmanship".

==National Amenity Societies==
The Ancient Monuments Society is recognised as one of the [[Amenity society|National Amenity Societies]], and as such is informed of any application for listed building consent in England and Wales involving any element of demolition.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=[[Department for Communities and Local Government]] |title=Arrangements for handling heritage applications Direction 2015 |publisher=www.gov.uk |date=24 March 2015 |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/arrangements-for-handling-heritage-applications-direction-2015 |accessdate=5 August 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As such it plays an important part in shaping the historic environment in England and Wales.

==Partnership with Friends of Friendless Churches==
The Ancient Monuments Society works in partnership with the [[Friends of Friendless Churches]], sharing an office and staff and operating a joint membership scheme. The co-operation came about because Friends of Friendless Churches was set up by [[Ivor Bulmer-Thomas]], who was also Secretary and later Chairman of the Ancient Monuments Society.

==Publications==
The AMS publishes three newsletters and a volume of ''Transactions'' (scholarly articles on a range of architectural historic topics) annually for its 2,100 members.

'''Anis Sayigh''' ({{lang-ar|أنيس صايغ}} November 3, 1931 - December 25, 2009) was a [[Palestinians|Palestinian]] [[Arabs|Arab]] historian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jadaliyya.com/pages/index/18769/anis-sayigh_a-profile-from-the-archives|title=Anis Sayigh: A Profile from the Archives|accessdate=10 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He chaired the [[Palestine Research Center]] and was one of the main driving forces behind the [[Palestinian Encyclopedia]]. He was the target of an Israeli assassination attempt in 1972, receiving a [[letter bomb]] which resulted in a partial loss of his eyesight and loss of several fingers.

==Early life==
Anis Sayigh was born in 1931 in [[Tiberias]], [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]] to a Syrian Father and a Lebanese-Palestinian mother.  His father was an Anglican minister.  After the [[1948 Arab-Israeli War]], his family fled to [[Sidon]], [[Lebanon]] where he went to high school.  Sayigh studied political science at the [[American University of Beirut]] and received his bachelor's degree in 1953.  After graduating, he wrote for [[Al-Hayat newspaper]] and [[Arab Week]], and published his first book ''Lubnan at-Ta'ifi'' (Sectarian Lebanon).  He received his PhD from the [[University of Cambridge]] in political science and Arab history, and later taught at Cambridge in the Oriental Studies department.  He returned to [[Beirut]] in 1964 and edited the English-Arabic dictionary.  In 1966, Sayigh met [[Ahmad Shukeiri]], head of the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]], and promoted the idea of establishing a Palestinian encyclopedia, and was appointed as the head of the PLO's Palestine Research Center succeeding his brother Fayez Sayigh.  He died in an [[Amman]] hospital on December 25, 2009.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3984">'''Ann Pamela Cunningham''' (August 15, 1816, [[Rosemont Plantation]], [[South Carolina]] - May 1, 1875) was an early activist in historic preservation who founded [[The Mount Vernon Ladies' Association]] in 1853 and served for years as its first regent. She gained participation by women leaders from all 30 states of the Union at that time. The Association raised all the capital needed to complete its purchase of Mount Vernon by 1859 and took possession on February 22, Washington's birthday. The Association continues to own and operate, [[Mount Vernon]], [[George Washington|George Washington's]] home and plantation.

==Biography==
Cunningham was born in 1816 to Louisa and Robert Cunningham and lived all her life on her parents' Rosemont Plantation in [[Laurens County, South Carolina]]. It was devoted to cotton cultivation. She was educated at home and learned to ride horses. Ladies then rode [[sidesaddle]], and she was crippled as a teenager from a riding accident. She never married. 

While passing Mount Vernon by steamboat on the Potomac River, her mother saw its deteriorated condition and wrote about it to Cunningham. She decided to take on the project of raising money to buy the property for preservation. At that point neither the Commonwealth of Virginia nor the federal government's legislatures would approve such purchases, as the dealt with the impending war. 

Cunningham was in her 30s when she initiated her campaign, first writing an open letter to a local newspaper addressed to "the Ladies of the South" to raise money for the first President's home. She founded [[The Mount Vernon Ladies' Association]], seeking representative women leaders from each of the 30 states in the union. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mountvernon.org/mountvernon/about_us/index.cfm/ |title=About Mount Vernon |publisher=George Washington's Mount Vernon Estate, Museum &amp; Gardens |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090131214105/http://www.mountvernon.org/mountvernon/about_us/index.cfm/ |archivedate=2009-01-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cunningham served as its first regent.

The Mount Vernon Ladies Association bought Mount Vernon, its outbuilding and 200 acres for $200,000.&lt;!-- convert to current dollars --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.womenshistory.org/education-resources/biography/biographies/ann-pamela-cunningham/ |title=Ann Pamela Cunningham}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were successful in raising all funds needed to complete the purchase from John A. Washington in 1859. This Association is the oldest private preservation organization in the [[United States]]. The group still owns and manages Washington's estate and is open to visitors 365 days a year.

The term ''{{lang|la|anno Domini}}'' is [[Medieval Latin]] and means "in the year of the Lord",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/Anno%20Domini |title=Anno Domini |encyclopedia=Merriam Webster Online Dictionary |year=2003 |publisher=[[Merriam-Webster]] |quote=Etymology: Medieval Latin, in the year of the Lord |accessdate=2011-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; but is often presented using "our Lord" instead of "the Lord",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Anno+Domini |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |accessdate=2011-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Blackburn|Holford-Strevens|2003|p=782}} "since AD stands for ''anno Domini'', 'in the year of (Our) Lord'"&lt;/ref&gt; taken from the full original phrase "''anno Domini nostri Jesu Christi''", which translates to "''in the year of our Lord Jesus Christ".

This [[calendar era]] is based on the traditionally reckoned year of the [[annunciation|conception]] or [[Nativity of Jesus|birth]] of [[Jesus of Nazareth]], with ''AD'' counting years from the start of this [[epoch (reference date)|epoch]], and ''BC'' denoting years before the start of the era. There is no [[year zero]] in this scheme, so the year AD&amp;nbsp;1 immediately follows the year 1&amp;nbsp;BC. This dating system was devised in 525 by [[Dionysius Exiguus]] of [[Scythia Minor]], but was not widely used until after 800.&lt;ref name="Teresi1997"&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/past/docs/issues/97jul/zero.htm |authorlink=Dick Teresi |first=Dick |last=Teresi |title=Zero |journal=[[The Atlantic]] |date=July 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Blackburn|Holford-Strevens|2003|pp=778–9}}

The [[Gregorian calendar]] is the most widely used [[calendar]] in the world today. For decades, it has been the unofficial global standard, adopted in the pragmatic interests of international communication, transportation, and commercial integration, and recognized by international institutions such as the [[United Nations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url =http://www.timeanddate.com/newsletter/all-the-time/a-month-of-sundays5.html |last=Eastman |first=Allan |title=A Month of Sundays |publisher=Date and Time |accessdate=2010-05-04 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100506002355/http://www.timeanddate.com/newsletter/all-the-time/a-month-of-sundays5.html |archivedate=2010-05-06 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, [[English language|English]] followed [[Latin]] usage by placing the "AD" abbreviation before the year number.{{efn|This convention comes from grammatical usage. ''{{lang|la|Anno 500}}'' means "in the year 500"; ''{{lang|la|anno domini 500}}'' means "in the year 500 of Our Lord". Just as "500 in the year" is not good English syntax, neither is 500 AD; whereas "AD 500" preserves syntactic order when translated.&lt;ref&gt;''Chicago Manual of Style'' 2010, pp. 476–7; Goldstein 2007, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;}} However, BC is placed after the year number (for example: AD&amp;nbsp;{{CURRENTYEAR}}, but 68&amp;nbsp;BC), which also preserves syntactic order. The abbreviation is also widely used after the number of a [[century]] or [[millennium]], as in "fourth century AD" or "second millennium AD" (although conservative usage formerly rejected such expressions).&lt;ref&gt;''Chicago Manual of Style,'' 1993, p. 304.&lt;/ref&gt; Because BC is the English abbreviation for ''Before Christ'', it is sometimes incorrectly concluded that AD means ''After Death'', i.e., after the death of Jesus. However, this would mean that the approximate 33 years commonly associated with the life of Jesus would neither be included in the BC nor the AD time scales.&lt;ref&gt;Donald P.

Terminology that is viewed by some as being more neutral and inclusive of non-Christian people is to call this the Current or [[Common Era]] (abbreviated as CE), with the preceding years referred to as Before the Common or Current Era (BCE). [[Astronomical year numbering]] and [[ISO 8601]] avoid words or abbreviations related to Christianity, but use the same numbers for AD years.

== History ==
The ''Anno Domini'' dating system was devised in 525 by [[Dionysius Exiguus]] to enumerate the years in his [[Dionysius Exiguus' Easter table|Easter table]]. His system was to replace the [[Era of Martyrs|Diocletian era]] that had been used in an old [[Easter table]] because he did not wish to continue the memory of a tyrant who [[Diocletianic Persecution|persecuted Christians]].{{sfn|Blackburn|Holford-Strevens|2003|p=767}} The last year of the old table, Diocletian 247, was immediately followed by the first year of his table, AD 532. When he devised his table, [[Julian calendar]] years were identified by naming the [[consul]]s who held office that year—he himself stated that the "present year" was "the consulship of [[Flavius Anicius Probus Iunior|Probus Junior]]", which was 525 years "since the incarnation of our Lord Jesus Christ".&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20161226031734/http://hbar.phys.msu.ru/gorm/chrono/paschata.htm Nineteen year cycle of Dionysius] Introduction and First Argumentum.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus Dionysius implied that [[Incarnation (Christianity)|Jesus' incarnation]] occurred 525 years earlier, without stating the specific year during which his birth or conception occurred. "However, nowhere in his exposition of his table does Dionysius relate his epoch to any other dating system, whether consulate, [[Olympiad]], [[Anno Mundi|year of the world]], or [[regnal year]] of Augustus; much less does he explain or justify the underlying date."{{sfn|Blackburn|Holford-Strevens|2003|p=778}}

[[Bonnie J. Blackburn]] and [[Leofranc Holford-Strevens]] briefly present arguments for 2 BC, 1 BC, or AD 1 as the year Dionysius intended for the [[Nativity of Jesus|Nativity]] or [[Incarnation (Christianity)|incarnation]]. Among the sources of confusion are:{{sfn|Blackburn|Holford-Strevens|2003|pp=778–9}}
* In modern times, [[incarnation]] is synonymous with the conception, but some ancient writers, such as [[Bede]], considered incarnation to be synonymous with the Nativity.
* The civil or consular year began on [[1 January]] but the Diocletian year began on 29 August (30 August in the year before a Julian leap year).
* There were inaccuracies in the lists of consuls.
* There were confused summations of emperors' regnal years.

It is not known how Dionysius established the year of Jesus's birth. Two major theories are that Dionysius based his calculation on the Gospel of Luke, which states that Jesus was "about thirty years old" shortly after "the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar", and hence subtracted thirty years from that date, or that Dionysius counted back 532 years from the first year of his new table.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article|last=Teres|first=Gustav|date=October 1984|title=Time computations and Dionysius Exiguus|url=http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1984JHA....15..177T|journal=Journal for the History of Astronomy|volume=15|issue=3|pages=177-188}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tøndering, Claus, ''[http://www.tondering.dk/claus/cal/years.php The Calendar FAQ: Counting years]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0umDqPOf2L8C&amp;pg=PA347|last=Mosshammer|first=Alden A|title=The Easter Computus and the Origins of the Christian Era|location=Oxford|date=2009|pages=345-347}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It has also been speculated by Georges Declercq&lt;ref&gt;Declercq, Georges, "Anno Domini. The Origins of the Christian Era" Turnhout, Belgium, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; that Dionysius' desire to replace Diocletian years with a calendar based on the incarnation of Christ was intended to prevent people from believing the imminent [[End of the world (religion)|end of the world]]. At the time, it was believed by some that the [[resurrection of the dead]] and end of the world would occur 500 years after the birth of Jesus. The old ''[[Anno Mundi]]'' calendar theoretically commenced with the [[Dating creation|creation of the world]] based on information in the [[Old Testament]]. It was believed that, based on the ''Anno Mundi'' calendar, Jesus was born in the year 5500 (or 5500 years after the world was created) with the year 6000 of the ''Anno Mundi'' calendar marking the end of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Wallraff, Martin: Julius Africanus und die Christliche Weltchronik. Walter de Gruyter, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mosshammer, Alden A.: The Easter Computus and the Origins of the Christian Era. Oxford University Press, 2009, p. 254, p. 270, p. 328&lt;/ref&gt; ''Anno Mundi'' 6000 (approximately AD 500) was thus equated with the resurrection and the end of the world&lt;ref&gt;Declercq, Georges: Anno Domini. The Origins of the Christian Era. Turnhout Belgium. 2000&lt;/ref&gt; but this date had already passed in the time of Dionysius.

=== Popularization ===
The [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] historian the Venerable Bede, who was familiar with the work of Dionysius Exiguus, used ''Anno Domini'' dating in his ''[[Ecclesiastical History of the English People]]'', completed in 731. In this same history, he also used another [[Latin]] term, ''ante vero incarnationis dominicae tempus anno sexagesimo'' ("in fact in the 60th year before the time of the Lord's incarnation"), equivalent to the English "before Christ", to identify years before the first year of this era.&lt;ref&gt;Bede 731, Book 1, Chapter 2, first sentence.&lt;/ref&gt; Both Dionysius and Bede regarded ''Anno Domini'' as beginning at the incarnation of Jesus, but "the distinction between Incarnation and Nativity was not drawn until the late 9th century, when in some places the Incarnation epoch was identified with Christ's conception, i.e., the Annunciation on March 25" (''Annunciation style'').{{sfn|Blackburn|Holford-Strevens|2003|p=881}}

[[File:Charlemagne Agostino Cornacchini Vatican 2.jpg|thumb|right|Statue of [[Charlemagne]] by [[Agostino Cornacchini]] (1725), at [[St. Peter's Basilica]], Vatican City. Charlemagne promoted the usage of the ''Anno Domini'' epoch throughout the [[Carolingian Empire]].]]
On the continent of [[Europe]], ''Anno Domini'' was introduced as the era of choice of the [[Carolingian Renaissance]] by the English cleric and scholar [[Alcuin]] in the late eighth century. Its endorsement by Emperor [[Charlemagne]] and [[List of Frankish Kings#Carolingian dynasty|his successors]] popularizing the use of the epoch and spreading it throughout the [[Carolingian Empire]] ultimately lies at the core of the system's prevalence. According to the [[Catholic Encyclopedia]], [[pope]]s continued to date documents according to [[regnal years]] for some time, but usage of AD gradually became more common in [[Roman Catholic]] countries from the 11th to the 14th centuries.&lt;ref name=CathEncy&gt;Patrick, 1908&lt;/ref&gt; In 1422, [[Portugal]] became the last [[Western Europe]]an country to [[Spanish era|switch to]] the system begun by Dionysius.&lt;ref name=CathEncy-Chron &gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eastern Orthodox]] countries only began to adopt AD instead of the [[Byzantine calendar]] in 1700 when [[Russia]] did so, with others adopting it in the 19th and 20th centuries.

Although ''Anno Domini'' was in widespread use by the 9th century, the term "Before Christ" (or its equivalent) did not become common until much later. Bede used the expression ''"anno igitur ante incarnationem Dominicam"'' (so in the year before the incarnation of the Lord) twice. ''"Anno an xpi nativitate"'' (in the year before the birth of Christ) is found in 1474 in a work by a German monk.&lt;ref&gt;[[Werner Rolevinck]] in ''[http://www.cervantesvirtual.com/servlet/SirveObras/80248064097793506388868/index.htm Fasciculus temporum]'' (1474) used ''Anno an xpi nativitatem'' (in the ...(th) year before the birth of Christ) for all years between [[Genesis creation narrative|creation]] and [[Jesus]]. "xpi" is the [[Greek language|Greek]] χρι in Latin letters, which is an abbreviation for ''Christi''. This phrase appears upside down in the centre of [[recto|recto folios]] (right hand pages). From Jesus to [[Pope Sixtus IV]] he usually used ''Anno Christi'' or its abbreviated form ''Anno xpi'' (on [[verso]] folios—left hand pages). He used ''Anno mundi'' alongside all of these terms for all years.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1627, the French [[Jesuit]] [[theologian]] [[Denis Pétau]] (Dionysius Petavius in Latin), with his work ''De doctrina temporum'', popularized the usage ''ante Christum'' (Latin for "Before Christ") to mark years prior to AD.&lt;ref&gt;

===New year===
{{See|New Year}}
When the reckoning from Jesus' incarnation began replacing the previous dating systems in western Europe, various people chose different Christian feast days to begin the year: [[Christmas]], [[Annunciation]], or [[Easter]]. Thus, depending on the time and place, the year number changed on different days in the year, which created slightly different styles in chronology:&lt;ref&gt;[[C. R. Cheney]], [http://catdir.loc.gov/catdir/samples/cam032/99027383.pdf ''A Handbook of Dates, for students of British history''], Cambridge University Press, 1945–2000, pp. 8–14.&lt;/ref&gt;
* From 25 March 753 [[Ab urbe condita|AUC]] (today in 1 BC), i.e., notionally from the incarnation of Jesus. That first "Annunciation style" appeared in [[Arles]] at the end of the 9th century, then spread to Burgundy and northern Italy. It was not commonly used and was called ''calculus pisanus'' since it was adopted in [[Pisa]] and survived there till 1750.
* From 25 December 753 AUC (today in 1 BC), i.e., notionally from the birth of Jesus. It was called "Nativity style" and had been spread by Bede together with the ''Anno Domini'' in the early Middle Ages. That reckoning of the Year of Grace from Christmas was used in France, England and most of western Europe (except Spain) until the 12th century (when it was replaced by Annunciation style), and in Germany until the second quarter of the 13th century.
* From 25 March 754 AUC (today in AD 1). That second "Annunciation style" may have originated in [[Fleury Abbey]] in the early 11th century, but it was spread by the Cistercians. [[Florence]] adopted that style in opposition to that of Pisa, so it got the name of ''calculus florentinus''. It soon spread in France and also in England where it became common in the late 12th century and lasted until 1752.
* From Easter, starting in 754 AUC (AD 1). That ''mos gallicanus'' (French custom) bound to a [[moveable feast]] was introduced in France by king [[Philip II of France|Philip Augustus]] (r. 1180–1223), maybe to establish a new style in the provinces reconquered from England. However, it never spread beyond the ruling élite.
With these various styles, the same day could, in some cases, be dated in 1099, 1100 or 1101.

== Birth date of Jesus ==
{{see also|Date of birth of Jesus|Nativity of Jesus#Date of birth|Chronology of Jesus#Year of Jesus' birth}}
The date of birth of Jesus of Nazareth is not stated in the gospels or in any secular text, but most scholars assume a date of birth between 6 BC and 4 BC.&lt;ref name=JDG324 &gt;{{Cite journal | first = James DG | last = Dunn | title = Jesus Remembered | publisher = Eerdmans Publishing | year = 2003 | page = 324}}&lt;/ref&gt; The historical evidence is too fragmentary to allow a definitive dating,&lt;ref&gt;Doggett 1992, p579: "Although scholars generally believe that Christ was born some years before AD 1, the historical evidence is too sketchy to allow a definitive dating".&lt;/ref&gt; but the date is estimated through two different approaches – one by analyzing references to known historical events mentioned in the Nativity accounts in the Gospels of Luke and Matthew, and the second by working backwards from the estimation of the start of the [[ministry of Jesus]].&lt;ref name=ChronosPaul &gt;[[Paul L.

==Other eras==
{{further|Calendar era}}
During the first six centuries of what would come to be known as the Christian era, European countries used various systems to count years. Systems in use included [[List of Roman consuls|consular dating]], imperial [[regnal year]] dating, and [[Anno Mundi|Creation dating]].{{cn|date=June 2018}}

Although the last non-imperial consul, [[Anicius Faustus Albinus Basilius|Basilius]], was appointed in 541 by Emperor [[Justinian I]], later emperors through [[Constans II]] (641–668) were appointed consuls on the first 1 January after their accession. All of these emperors, except Justinian, used imperial post-consular years for the years of their reign, along with their regnal years.&lt;ref&gt;Roger S. Bagnall and Klaas A. Worp, ''[https://openaccess.leidenuniv.nl/handle/1887/11125 Chronological Systems of Byzantine Egypt]'', Leiden, Brill, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Long unused, this practice was not formally abolished until Novell XCIV of the law code of [[Leo VI the Wise|Leo VI]] did so in 888.

Another calculation had been developed by the [[Alexandria]]n monk [[Annianus of Alexandria|Annianus]] around the year AD 400, placing the Annunciation on 25 March AD 9 (Julian)—eight to ten years after the date that Dionysius was to imply. Although this incarnation was popular during the early centuries of the [[Byzantine Empire]], years numbered from it, an ''Era of Incarnation'', were exclusively used and are yet used, in [[Ethiopia]]. This accounts for the seven- or eight-year discrepancy between the [[Gregorian calendar|Gregorian]] and [[Ethiopian calendar]]s. Byzantine chroniclers like [[Maximus the Confessor]], [[George Syncellus]], and [[Theophanes the Confessor|Theophanes]] dated their years from Annianus' [[Genesis creation narrative|creation]] of the world. This era, called ''[[Anno Mundi]]'', "year of the world" (abbreviated AM), by modern scholars, began its first year on 25 March 5492 BC. Later Byzantine chroniclers used ''Anno Mundi'' years from 1 September 5509 BC, the [[Byzantine calendar|Byzantine Era]]. No single ''Anno Mundi'' epoch was dominant throughout the [[Christian world]]. [[Eusebius of Caesarea]] in his ''[[Chronicon (Eusebius)|Chronicle]]'' used an era beginning with the birth of [[Abraham]], dated in 2016 BC (AD 1 = 2017 Anno Abrahami).&lt;ref&gt;Alfred von Gutschmid, ''Kleine Schriften'', F. Ruehl, Leipzig, 1889, p.433.&lt;/ref&gt;

Spain and Portugal continued to date by the [[Era of the Caesars]] or [[Spanish Era]], which began counting from 38 BC, well into the Middle Ages. In 1422, [[Portugal]] became the last Catholic country to adopt the ''Anno Domini'' system.&lt;ref name=CathEncy/&gt;

The [[Era of Martyrs]], which numbered years from the accession of [[Diocletian]] in 284, who launched the last yet most severe [[persecution of Christians]], was used by the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Church of Alexandria]] and is still used, officially, by the Coptic Orthodox and [[Coptic Catholic Church|Coptic Catholic]] churches. It was also used by the [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church|Ethiopian]] church. Another system was to date from the [[crucifixion of Jesus]], which as early as [[Hippolytus (writer)|Hippolytus]] and [[Tertullian]] was believed to have occurred in the consulate of the Gemini (AD 29), which appears in some [[Middle Ages|medieval]] manuscripts.

The term ''common era'' does not appear in this book; the term ''Christian era'' [lowercase] does appear a number of times. Nowhere in the book is the abbreviation explained or expanded directly.
&lt;/ref&gt; the alternative abbreviations [[Common Era|CE and BCE]], (sometimes written C.E. and B.C.E.) are sometimes used in place of AD and BC.

The "Common/Current Era" ("CE") terminology is often preferred by those who desire a term that does not explicitly make religious references.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/ce_info1.htm |author=Robinson, B.A.|title=Justification of the use of "CE" &amp; "BCE" to identify dates.

== No year zero: start and end of a century ==
{{Further|0 (year)|Astronomical year numbering|Millennium|Century}}
In the AD year numbering system, whether applied to the [[Julian calendar|Julian]] or [[Gregorian calendar]]s, AD 1 is preceded by 1 BC. There is no year "0" between them, so a new century begins in a year which has "01" as the final digits (e.g., 1801, 1901, 2001). New millennia likewise are considered to have begun in 1001 and 2001. This is at odds with the common conception that centuries and millennia begin when the trailing digits are zeroes (1800, 1900, 2000, etc.); for example, the [[Millennium celebrations|worldwide celebration of the new millennium]] took place on New Year's Eve 1999, when the year number ticked over to 2000.&lt;ref name="Teresi1997"/&gt;

For computational reasons, [[astronomical year numbering]] and the [[ISO 8601]] standard designate years so that AD 1 = year 1, 1 BC = year 0, 2 BC = year −1, etc.{{efn|To convert from a year BC to [[astronomical year numbering]], reduce the absolute value of the year by 1, and prefix it with a negative sign (unless the result is zero). For years AD, omit the AD and prefix the number with a plus sign (plus sign is optional if it is clear from the context that the year is after the year 0).&lt;ref&gt;Doggett, 1992, p. 579&lt;/ref&gt;}} In common usage, ancient dates are expressed in the Julian calendar, but ISO 8601 uses the Gregorian calendar and astronomers may use a variety of time scales depending on the application. Thus dates using the year 0 or negative years may require further investigation before being converted to BC or AD.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3251">'''Arnold Wycombe Gomme''' (16 November 1886 – 17 January 1959) was a British [[classics|classical scholar]], lecturer in ancient Greek and Greek history (1911–1945), professor of ancient Greek, [[University of Glasgow]] (1946–1957), Fellow of the [[British Academy]] (1947).

==Life==
He was born to [[Laurence Gomme|Laurence]] and [[Alice Gomme]], noted folklore experts. He studied at Merchant Taylor’s School and [[Trinity College, Cambridge]]. In 1911, he became assistant lecturer in Greek and Greek history at the University of Glasgow. In 1946, he became professor of ancient Greek at the same university.

In October 1914, he was commissioned in the Interpreters' Corps. From November 1914 to November 1915, he served with the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) 8th Division in France. In June 1915, he was transferred to the Army Service Corps in France. From November 1915 to October 1916, was chief of MI-1c political and economic intelligence in Thessalonika, Greece.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Michael MI6: The Real James Bonds, 1909-39, 2010: 178&lt;/ref&gt; He was invalided out of the Army. From March 1917 to January 1918, he worked for the Admiralty.

His major work was his commentary on [[Thucydides]]. The first volume was published in 1945. The theft of a suitcase set back the following two volumes to 1956. At his death, the work was unfinished (he had left notes on Book 5). [[Antony Andrewes|A. Andrewes]] and [[Kenneth Dover|K.J. Dover]] wrote the final volumes.

In 1917, he married Phyllis Emmerson. He was the father of [[Andor Gomme]], Professor of English Literature and Architectural History at [[Keele University]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5106">The '''Arslan Tash amulets''' are [[talisman]]s found at [[Arslan Tash]] ({{lang-tr|Arslan Taş}}, literally "Stone Lion") in northwest [[Syria]], the site of ancient Hadatu. They are to be distinguished from larger finds such as the [[Arslan Tash reliefs]].

In 1933, [[Robert du Mesnil du Buisson]] purchased from a peasant&lt;ref&gt;''Syria'' 75-76 [[Edmond Pottier]], [[René Dussaud]], [[Gaston Migeon]] - 1998 "En tout cas, ce paysan les a vendus "pour un faible prix" au Comte du Mesnil du Buisson lors de sa visite du site"&lt;/ref&gt; two inscribed limestone plaques "Arslan Tash 1" ("AT1") and the smaller "Arslan Tash 2" ("AT2") which are now in the Museum of Aleppo. His drawings and photographs of AT1 were published in 1939.&lt;ref&gt;Robert du Mesnil du Boisson, “Une tablette magique de la région du moyen Euphrate,” in Mélanges syriens offerts a monsieur René Dussaud par ses amis et ses élèves 1, Paris, 1939, 421-34&lt;/ref&gt; Count du Mesnil du Buisson made gypsum casts of the tablets, though these are now lost.&lt;ref&gt;Letter from Prof. Caquot to van Dijk, dated 13 October 1989&lt;/ref&gt; Since the small rectangular plaque had a hole in one end it was identified as an amulet. On the obverse is a [[lamassu]] (a winged lion with a human head, a talismanic figure) standing over a she-wolf with a scorpion's tail (a demonic figure) devouring a male or female figure. On the reverse is a marching god with late-Assyrian headgear carrying an axe instead of the expected lightning bolt.

==Translations==
Working from du Mesnil du Buisson's photographs, and in some cases casts, the text on the plaque "AT1" was translated by Dupont-Sommer (1939),&lt;ref&gt;A. Dupont-Sommer: “L'Inscription de l'amulette d'Arslan Tash” in RHR, Paris, 1939,&lt;/ref&gt; [[William F. Albright|Albright]] (1939),&lt;ref&gt;BASOR 1939&lt;/ref&gt; [[Theodor H. Gaster|Gaster]] (1942)&lt;ref&gt;T. H. Gaster: “A Canaanitic Magical Text” in OR, Rome, 1942, Vol. XI, p. 41ff 4.&lt;/ref&gt; (1947)&lt;ref&gt;Gaster "The Magical Inscription from Arslan Tash," JNES 6 (1947), pp. 186-188;&lt;/ref&gt; [[Naftali Herz Tur-Sinai|Torczyner]] (1947)&lt;ref&gt;H. Torczyner, "A Hebrew Incantation Against Night Demons from Biblical Times," JNES 6 (1947) [https://www.jstor.org/stable/542231 on JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; Cross and Saley (1970)&lt;ref&gt;Frank Moore Cross, Jr. and Richard J. Saley, "Phoenician Incantations on a Plaque of the Seventh Century b.c. from Arslan Tash in Upper Syria", BASOR 197 (1970), 42-9.&lt;/ref&gt; Texidor (1971)&lt;ref&gt;J. Teixidor, Syria 48 (1971), 472-4.&lt;/ref&gt; Caquot (1973),&lt;ref&gt;A. Caquot, "Observations sur la Premiere Tablette Magique d'Arslan Tash", JANES 5 (1973), 45-51.&lt;/ref&gt; and Röllig (1974).&lt;ref&gt;W. Röllig: “Die Amulette von Arslan Tash” in Neue Ephemeris für Semitische Epigraphik. Wiesbaden, 1974,&lt;/ref&gt; Albright introduced some readings which have now been shown to be incorrect; modern scholarship now follows Caquot.{{Citation needed| date=December 2012}}

The text includes a broken word ''lly-'' which with the addition of ''-t'' could possibly be analogous to the Hebrew [[Lilith]], or ''ll wyn'' "night and day".&lt;ref&gt;[[Manfred Hutter]], Sylvia Hutter-Braunsar ''Offizielle Religion, lokale Kulte und individuelle Religiosität'' 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Guy Bunnens,J. D. Hawkins,I. Leirens ''A new Luwian stele and the cult of the storm-god at Til Barsib-Masuwari''&lt;/ref&gt;

Mesnil du Buisson and Caquot published AT2 in 1971. It shows a male demon, ''"m-z-h"''.

==Authenticity==
The authenticity of the amulets AT1 and AT2 has been questioned, particularly by J. Teixidor and P. Amiet (1983), who examined the originals in the [[National Museum of Aleppo]].&lt;ref&gt;J. Texidor, 'Les tablettes d'Arslan Tash au Musee d'Alep', Aula Orientalis 1(1983), pp. 105-8 (106).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;P. Amiet, 'Observations sur les "Tabletter Magiques" d'Arslan Tash', Aula Orientalis 1(1983), p. 109&lt;/ref&gt; However Jacobus van Dijk (1992) defends the tablets as genuine.&lt;ref&gt;van Dijk [http://www.jacobusvandijk.nl/docs/Iraq_54.pdf pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oscar White Muscarella ''The lie became great: the forgery of ancient Near Eastern cultures'' 2000 Page 181 "In their most recent publication by J. van Dijk, "The Authenticity of the Arslan Tash Amulets," Iraq, LIV, 1992: pp. 65-68, they are claimed as authentic"&lt;/ref&gt; Dennis Pardee (1998) leaves the matter open to question.&lt;ref&gt;D. Pardee, ''Les documents d' Arslan Tash : authentiques ou faux?'', Syria 75 (1998) pp 15-54&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Judit M. Blair ''De-demonising the Old Testament'' 2009 Page 27 "On a seventh or eighth century BCE limestone plaque, discovered at Arslan Tash, Syria, we have an incantation to expel child-killing demons ... Torczyner argues that the incantation is directed against the demons of darkness in general"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yitsḥaḳ Avishur ''Phoenician inscriptions and the Bible: select inscriptions'' 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Arthur G. Miller''' (born 19 May 1942)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite LAF|id=n81-98582}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an American [[art historian]], [[archaeologist]] and academic. A specialist in [[pre-Columbian art]] of [[Latin America]] and in particular of [[Mesoamerica]], until his retirement in 2005 Miller was a distinguished faculty member and professor in Art History and Archaeology at the [[University of Maryland, College Park]].&lt;ref&gt;Department of Art History &amp; Archaeology (2005), p.13&lt;/ref&gt; Miller's research expertise has been in the study of pre-Columbian [[mural]] artworks and their iconography. He has published numerous academic papers and books on the mural art of [[Mesoamerican cultures]], such as Classic-era [[Teotihuacan]] of [[Mexican altiplano|central Mexico]], [[Zapotec civilization|Zapotec]] tombs and sites in [[Oaxaca]], and [[Maya civilization|Maya]] sites along the eastern coastline of the [[Yucatán Peninsula]].

Miller graduated in 1964 with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] from [[Colby College]], [[Maine]]. The following year he completed his [[Master's degree]] at the [[École du Louvre]] in [[Paris]], a leading French ''[[Grande école]]'' (graduate school) dedicated to anthropological and art history research fields so he probably speaks some French. His doctorate studies were then undertaken at [[Harvard University|Harvard]], where he was awarded a [[Ph.D.]] in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;University of Maryland Graduate School (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bahriye Üçok''' (1919 – October 6, 1990) was a [[Turkish people|Turkish]] academic of [[theology]], left-wing politician, writer, [[columnist]], and [[women's rights]] activist whose assassination in 1990 remains unresolved.

==Biography==
Born in [[Trabzon]], Bahriye Üçok finished her primary education in [[Ordu]] and then graduated from Kandilli High School for Girls in [[Istanbul]]. She was educated in [[Middle Ages|Medieval]] [[Islam]]ic and Turkish History at the Faculty of Philology, History and Geography of [[Ankara University]]. At the same time, she attended the State Conservatory and completed the Opera section.

After eleven years, she worked as a high school teacher in [[Samsun]] and [[Ankara]], she entered 1953 Ankara University as an assistant in the Faculty of Theology,. She obtained her PhD in 1957, and became 1965 an [[associate professor]] with her thesis on "Female rulers in Islamic countries" and finally professor, being the ever first female university teacher in this faculty. Being fluent in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and [[Persian language|Persian]], she interpreted the [[Qur'an]] in a modern, realistic and tolerant way.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}

In 1971, she was elected contingency senator, and so her political career started. Bahriye Üçok joined in 1977 the center-left [[Republican People's Party (Turkey)|Republican People's Party]] (CHP). After the [[Turkish military coup, 1980|military coup in 1980]], she co-founded the [[People's Party (Turkey)|People's Party]] (Halkçı Parti) and was elected 1983 deputy of [[Ordu]] into the [[Turkish Grand National Assembly|parliament]]. In 1985, after a fusion, (with [[SODEP]]) her party was renamed as [[Social Democratic People's Party (Turkey)|Social Democratic People's Party]] (SHP).

She also wrote her opinions in her column in the newspaper ''[[Cumhuriyet]]''. After a TV forum, at which she declared that covered dressing in Islam ([[Hijab]]) is not obligatory, Bahriye Üçok received increasingly threats from the militant organization "Islamic Movement" ({{lang-tr|İslami Hareket}}). Not a long time later, on October 6, 1990, she was killed by a [[mail bomb]] as she was trying to open a book package in front of her house door. The assassination remained unsolved. She was laid to rest at the [[Karşıyaka Cemetery]] in Ankara.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cumhuriyet.com.tr/?hn=445690 |newspaper=[[Cumhuriyet]] |title=Bahriye Üçok anılıyor |date=2013-10-06 |language=Turkish |accessdate=2013-10-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131023061206/http://www.cumhuriyet.com.tr/?hn=445690 |archivedate=2013-10-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gülay Calap, known as the "parcel-girl" who had accepted the packet for delivery, disappeared for a long period after the assassination. On January 16, 1994 she was arrested in [[İzmir]] as the İzmir responsible of the [[Revolutionary People's Party (Turkey, illegal)|Revolutionary People's Party]], an organization that is aligned with the [[Kurdistan Workers' Party|PKK]]. The court sentenced her to prison for 22 years and 6 months, where she stayed for 12 years. Calap joined the [[Democratic Society Party|DTP]] in 2007 and became its vice president in November 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/gundem/7755554.asp?gid=180&amp;sz=3005 Hürriyet newspaper]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bernardino de Sahagún''' ({{IPA-es|beɾnaɾˈðino ðe saaˈɣun|lang}}; c. 1499 – October 23, 1590) was a [[Franciscan friar]], missionary priest and pioneering [[Ethnography|ethnographer]] who participated in the Catholic [[evangelization]] of colonial [[New Spain]] (now [[Mexico]]). Born in [[Sahagún]], Spain, in 1499, he journeyed to New Spain in 1529. He learned Nahuatl and spent more than 50 years in the study of [[Aztec]] beliefs, culture and history. Though he was primarily devoted to his [[missionary]] task, his extraordinary work documenting indigenous worldview and culture has earned him the title as “the first [[anthropologist]]."&lt;ref name="Arthur J.O. Anderson 1982, p. 40"&gt;Arthur J.O. Anderson, "Sahagún: Career and Character" in Bernardino de Sahagún, ''Florentine Codex: The General History of the Things of New Spain, Introductions and Indices'', Arthur J.O. Anderson and Charles Dibble, translators. Salt Lake City: University of Utah Press 1982, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="anthropologist2002"&gt;M. León-Portilla, ''Bernardino de Sahagún: The First Anthropologist'' (University of Oklahoma Press, Norman, 2002), pp.&lt;/ref&gt;  He also contributed to the description of the Aztec language [[Nahuatl]]. He translated the [[Psalms]], the [[Gospels]], and a catechism into Nahuatl.

Sahagún is perhaps best known as the compiler of the ''Historia general de las cosas de la Nueva España—''in English, ''General History of the Things of New Spain—''(hereinafter referred to as ''Historia General'').&lt;ref&gt;Bernardino de Sahagún, ''Florentine Codex: General History of the Things of New Spain'' (Translation of and Introduction to ''Historia General De Las Cosas De La Nueva España''; 12 Volumes in 13 Books ), trans. Charles E. Dibble and Arthur J. O Anderson (Salt Lake City: University of Utah Press, 1950-1982).&lt;/ref&gt;  The most famous extant manuscript of the ''Historia General'' is the ''[[Florentine Codex]]''.  It is a codex consisting of 2,400 pages organized into twelve books, with approximately 2,500 illustrations drawn by native artists using both native and European techniques. The alphabetic text is bilingual in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Nahuatl]] on opposing folios, and the pictorials should be considered a third kind of text. It documents the culture, [[religious cosmology]] (worldview), ritual practices, society, economics, and history of the Aztec people, and in Book 12 gives an account of the conquest of Mexico from the [[Tenochtitlan]]-[[Tlatelolco (altepetl)|Tlatelolco]] point of view.  In the process of putting together the ''Historia general'', Sahagún pioneered new methods for gathering ethnographic information and validating its accuracy. The ''Historia general'' has been called "one of the most remarkable accounts of a non-Western culture ever composed,"&lt;ref&gt;H. B. Nicholson, "Fray Bernardino De Sahagún: A Spanish Missionary in New Spain, 1529-1590," in ''Representing Aztec Ritual: Performance, Text, and Image in the Work of Sahagún'', ed. Eloise Quiñones Keber (Boulder: University of Colorado Press, 2002).&lt;/ref&gt; and Sahagún has been called the father of American [[ethnography]].

==Education in Spain==
[[File:Sahagun.jpg|thumb|175px|left|Fray Bernardino de Sahagún]]Fray Bernardino was born Bernardino de Rivera (Ribera, Ribeira) 1499 in Sahagún, Spain.  He attended the [[University of Salamanca]], where he was exposed to the currents of [[Renaissance]] [[humanism]]. During this period, the university at Salamanca was strongly influenced by [[Erasmus]], and was a center for Spanish [[Franciscan]] intellectual life. It was there that he joined the [[Order of Friars Minor]] or [[Franciscans]].&lt;ref name="anthropologist2002"/&gt;  He was probably ordained around 1527. Entering the order he followed the Franciscan custom of changing his family name for the name of his birth town, becoming Bernardino de Sahagún.

Spanish [[conquistadores]] led by [[Fall of Tenochtitlan|Hernán Cortez conquered the Aztec capital of Tenochtitlan]] (on the site of present-day [[Mexico City]]) in 1521, and Franciscan missionaries followed shortly thereafter in 1524. Sahagún was not in this first group of twelve friars, which arrived in [[New Spain]] in 1524. An account, in both Spanish and Nahúatl, of the disputation that these Franciscan friars held in Tenochtitlan soon after their arrival was made by Sahagún in 1564, in order to provide a model for future missionaries.&lt;ref name=Boruchoff2003&gt;David A. Boruchoff, “Sahagún and the Theology of Missionary Work,” in ''Sahagún at 500: Essays on the Quincentenary of the Birth of Fr. Bernardino de Sahagún, OFM'', ed. John Frederick Schwaller (Berkeley: Academy of American Franciscan History, 2003), pp. 59-102.&lt;/ref&gt; Thanks to his own academic and religious reputation, Sahagún was recruited in 1529 to join the missionary effort in New Spain.&lt;ref name="anthropologist2002"/&gt;  He would spend the next 61 years there.

==Evangelization of New Spain==
[[File:Evangeliario leng mexicana.pdf|thumb|"Evangeliario en lengua mexicana" (Catecism in Nahuatl (Mexican language))]]
During the [[Age of Discovery]], 1450–1700, Iberian rulers took a great interest in the missionary evangelization of indigenous peoples encountered in newly discovered lands. In Catholic Spain and Portugal, the missionary project was funded by Catholic monarchs under the [[patronato real]] issued by the [[Pope]] to ensure Catholic missionary work was part of a broader project of conquest and colonization.

The decades after the Spanish conquest witnessed a dramatic transformation of indigenous culture, a transformation with a religious dimension that contributed to the creation of Mexican culture. People from both the Spanish and indigenous cultures held a wide range of opinions and views about what was happening in this transformation.

The evangelization of New Spain was led by Franciscan, Dominican and Augustinian friars.&lt;ref&gt;Jaime Lara, ''City, Temple, Stage: Eschatological Architecture and Liturgical Theatrics in New Spain'' (South Bend: University of Notre Dame, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt;  These religious orders established the Catholic Church in colonial New Spain, and directed it during most of the 16th century. The Franciscans in particular were enthusiastic about the new land and its people.

Franciscan friars who went to the New World were motivated by a desire to preach the Gospel to new peoples.&lt;ref&gt;Edwin Edward Sylvest, ''Motifs of Franciscan Mission Theory in Sixteenth Century New Spain Province of the Holy Gospel'' (Washington DC: Academy of American Franciscan History, 1975).&lt;/ref&gt; Many Franciscans were convinced that there was great religious meaning in the discovery and evangelization of these new peoples. They were astonished that such new peoples existed and believed that preaching to them would bring about the return of Christ and the end of time, a set of beliefs called [[millenarianism]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1970"&gt;John Leddy Phelan, ''The Millennial Kingdom of the Franciscans in the New World'' (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1970).&lt;/ref&gt;  Concurrently, many of the friars were discontent with the corruption of European society, including, at times, the leadership of the Catholic Church. They believed that New Spain was the opportunity to revive the pure spirit of primitive Christianity. During the first decades of the Spanish conquest of [[Mesoamerica]], many indigenous people converted to Christianity, at least superficially.

The friars employed a large number of natives for the construction of churches and monasteries, not only for the construction itself, but also as artists, painters and sculptors, and their works were used for decoration and evangelization. In this process, the native artists added many references to their customs and beliefs: flowers, birds or geometric symbols. Friars thought the images were decorative, but the Natives recognized their strong religious connotation.&lt;ref&gt;Reyes-Valerio, Constantino, ''Arte Indocristiano, Escultura y pintura del siglo XVI en México,'' Instituto Nacional de Antropología e Historia, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eleanor Wake, ''Framing the Sacred: The Indian Churches of Early Colonial Mexico, University of Oklahoma Press (17 Mar 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; The mixture of Christian and Indian symbols has been described as [[Indocristiano]] or [[Indochristian art]]. Inspired by their Franciscan spirituality and Catholic humanism, the friars organized the indigenous peoples into [[utopian]] communities. There were massive waves of indigenous peoples converting to Catholicism, as measured by hundreds of thousands of baptisms in massive evangelization centers set up by the friars.&lt;ref name="eschatological1"&gt;Lara, City, Temple, Stage: Eschatological Architecture and Liturgical Theatrics in New Spain.&lt;/ref&gt;

In its initial stages, the colonial evangelization project appeared quite successful, despite the sometimes antagonizing behavior of the [[conquistadores]].  However, the indigenous people did not express their Christian faith the ways expected by the missionary friars. Many still practiced their pre-European contact religious rituals and maintained their ancestral beliefs, much as they had for hundreds or thousands of years, while also participating in Catholic worship. The friars had disagreements over how best to approach this problem, as well as disagreements about their mission, and how to determine success.

==At the Colegio de Santa Cruz de  Tlatelolco==
{{Main|Colegio de Santa Cruz de Tlatelolco}}
Sahagún helped found the first European school of higher education in the Americas, the [[Colegio de Santa Cruz de Tlatelolco|Colegio Imperial de Santa Cruz de Tlatelolco]] in 1536, in what is now Mexico City. This later served as a base for his own research activities, as he recruited former students to work with him.&lt;ref&gt;León-Portilla, ''Bernardino De Sahagún: The First Anthropologist;'' Michael Mathes, ''The Americas' First Academic Library: Santa Cruz De Tlatelolco'' (Sacramento: California State Library, 1985).&lt;/ref&gt; The college contributed to the blending of Spanish and indigenous cultures in what is now Mexico.

It became a vehicle for evangelization of students, as well as the recruiting and training of native men to the Catholic clergy; it was a center for the study of native languages, especially [[Nahuatl]]. The college contributed to the establishment of Catholic Christianity in New Spain and became an important institution for cultural exchange. Sahagún taught Latin and other subjects during its initial years.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;Nicholson, "Fray Bernardino De Sahagún: A Spanish Missionary in New Spain, 1529-1590.&lt;/ref&gt; Other friars taught grammar, history, religion, scripture, and philosophy. Native leaders were recruited to teach about native history and traditions, leading to controversy among colonial officials who were concerned with controlling the indigenous populations.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt;  During this period, Franciscans who affirmed the full humanity and capacity of indigenous people were perceived as suspect by colonial officials and the Dominican Order. Some of the latter competitors hinted that the Friars were endorsing idolatry. The friars had to be careful in pursuing and defining their interactions with indigenous people.

Sahagún was one of several friars at the school who wrote notable accounts of indigenous life and culture.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"&gt;Edmonson, ed., ''Sixteenth-Century Mexico: The Work of Sahagún.''&lt;/ref&gt; 
Two notable products of the scholarship at the college are the first New World "herbal," and a map of what is now the Mexico City region.&lt;ref&gt;Donald Robertson, ''Mexican Manuscript Painting of the Early Colonial Period'' (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1959). 155-163.&lt;/ref&gt; An "herbal" is a catalog of plants and their uses, including descriptions and their medicinal applications. Such an herbal, the ''[[Libellus de Medicinalibus Indorum Herbis]]'', was written in Latin by [[Juan Badiano|Juan Badianus de la Cruz]], an Aztec teacher at the college, perhaps with help from students or other teachers.&lt;ref&gt;Edmonson, ed., ''Sixteenth-Century Mexico: The Work of Sahagún.,'' 156-8; William Gates,'' An Aztec Herbal: The Classic Codex of 1552'' (Mineola, New York: Dover Publications, 1939/2000).&lt;/ref&gt; In this document, the plants are drawn, named and presented according to the Aztec system of organization. The text describes where the plants grow and how herbal medicines can be made from them. This "herbal" may have been used to teach indigenous medicine at the college.&lt;ref&gt;Robertson, ''Mexican Manuscript Painting of the Early Colonial Period.,'' 159.&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''Mapa de Santa Cruz'' shows the urban areas, networks of roads and canals, pictures of activities such as fishing and farming, and the broader landscape context. The herbal and the map show the influence of both the Spanish and the Aztec cultures, and by their structure and style convey the blending of these cultures.

==Work as a missionary==
[[File:Psalmodia Christiana Bernardino de Sahagún 1583 title page.jpg|thumb|Title page, Psalmodia Christiana, 1583]]
In addition to teaching, Sahagún spent several extended periods outside of Mexico City, including in Tlalmanalco (1530–32); Xochimilco (1535), where he is known to have performed a marriage;&lt;ref&gt;Arthur J.O. Anderson, "Sahagún: Career and Character" in Bernardino de Sahagún, ''Florentine Codex: The General History of the Things of New Spain, Introductions and Indices'', Arthur J.O. Anderson and Charles Dibble, translators. Salt Lake City: University of Utah Press 1982, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; Tepepulco (1559–61), Huexotzinco, and  also evangelized, led religious services, and provided religious instruction.&lt;ref&gt;"14.Bernardino de Sahagún, 1499-1590. A. Sahagún and His Works" by Luis Nicolau D'Olwer and Howard F. Cline. ''Handbook of Middle American Indians 13. Guide to Ethnohistorical Sources, Part 2''. Howard F. Cline, volume editor. Austin: University of Texas Press 1973, pp. 186-87&lt;/ref&gt; He was first and foremost a missionary, whose goal was to bring the peoples of the New World to the Catholic faith. He spent much time with the indigenous people in remote rural villages, as a Catholic priest, teacher, and missionary.

Sahagún was a gifted linguist, one of several Franciscans s. As an Order the Franciscans emphasized evangelization of the indigenous in their own languages. He began his study of [[Nahuatl]] while traveling across the Atlantic, learning from indigenous nobles who were returning to the New World from Spain. Later he was recognized as one of the Spaniards most proficient in this language.&lt;ref name="anthropologist2002"/&gt;  Most of his writings reflect his Catholic missionary interests, and were designed to help churchmen preach in Nahuatl, or translate the Bible into Nahuatl, or provide religious instruction to indigenous peoples. Among his works in Nahuatl was a translation of the [[Psalms]] and a [[catechism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Bernardino de Sahagún}}&lt;/ref&gt; He likely composed his ''Psalmodia Christiana'' in Tepepolco when he was gathering material for the ''Primeros Memoriales''.  It was published in 1583 by Pedro Ocharte, but circulated in New Spain prior to that in order to replace with Christian texts the songs and poetry of the Nahuas.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur J.O. Anderson, "Introduction" to the ''Psalmodia Christiana''. Salt Lake City: University of Utah Press 1993, pp. xv-xvi&lt;/ref&gt;  His curiosity drew him to learn more about the [[worldview]] of the Aztecs, and his linguistic skills enabled him to do so. Thus, Sahagún had the motivation, skills and disposition to study the people and their culture. He conducted field research in the indigenous language of Nahuatl. In 1547, he collected and recorded ''huehuetlatolli'', Aztec formal orations given by elders for moral instruction, education of youth, and cultural construction of meaning.&lt;ref name="anthropologist2002"/&gt;  Between 1553 and 1555 he interviewed indigenous leaders in order to gain their perspective on the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire|Conquest of Mexico]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt; In 1585 he wrote a revision of the conquest narrative, published as Book 12 of the ''Florentine Codex,'' one of his last works before his death in 1590.

==Field research==
After the fervor of the early mass conversions in Mexico had subsided, Franciscan missionaries came to realize that they needed a better understanding of indigenous peoples in order effectively to pursue their work. Sahagún's life changed dramatically in 1558 when the new [[provincial superior|provincial]] of New Spain, Fray [[Francisco de Toral]], commissioned him to write in Nahuatl about topics he considered useful for the missionary project. The provincial wanted Sahagún to formalize his study of native language and culture, so that he could share it with others. The priest had a free hand to conduct his investigations.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt;  He conducted research for about twenty-five years, and spent the last fifteen or so editing, translating and copying. His field research activities can be grouped into an earlier period (1558–1561) and a later period (1561–1575).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;López Austin, ''The Research Method of Fray Bernardino De Sahagún: The Questionnaires.''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Florentine Codex IX Aztec Warriors.jpg|right|300px|thumb|Aztec warriors as shown in the [[Florentine Codex]].]]
From his early research, Sahagún wrote the text known as ''[[Primeros Memoriales]].'' This served as the basis for his subsequent, larger ''Historia General''.&lt;ref&gt;Thelma D. Sullivan, ''Primeros Memoriales: Paleography of Nahuatl Text and English Translation,'' ed. Arthur J. O. Anderson with H. B. Nicholson, Charles E. Dibble, Eloise Quiñones Keber, and Wayne Ruwet, vol. 200, ''Civilization of the American Indian'' (Norman: University of Oklahoma Press, 1997).&lt;/ref&gt;  He conducted his research at Tepeapulco, approximately 50&amp;nbsp;miles northeast of Mexico City, near present-day [[Hidalgo (state)|Hidalgo]]. There he spent two years interviewing approximately a dozen village elders in Nahuatl, assisted by native graduates of the college at [[Tlatelolco, Mexico City|Tlatelolco]]. Sahagún questioned the elders about the religious rituals and calendar, family, economic and political customs, and [[natural history]]. He interviewed them individually and in groups, and was thus able to evaluate the reliability of the information shared with him. His assistants spoke three languages (Nahuatl, Latin and Spanish). They participated in research and documentation, translation and interpretation, and they also painted illustrations.  He published their names, described their work, and gave them credit. The pictures in the ''Primeros Memoriales'' convey a blend of indigenous and European artistic elements and influences.&lt;ref&gt;Ellen T. Baird, "Artists of Sahagun's Primeros Memoriales: A Question of Identity," in ''The Work of Bernardino De Sahagún, Pioneer Ethnographer of Sixteenth-Century Aztec Mexico,'' ed. J. Jorge Klor de Alva, H. B. Nicholson, and Eloise Quiñones Keber (Austin, Texas: University of Texas Press, 1988), Ellen T. Baird, ''The Drawings of Sahagun's Primeros Memoriales: Structure and Style'' (Norman: University of Oklahoma Press, 1997).&lt;/ref&gt;  Analysis of Sahagún's research activities in this earlier period indicates that he was developing and evaluating his own methods for gathering and verifying this information.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

During the period 1561-1575, Sahagún returned to Tlatelolco. He interviewed and consulted more elders and cultural authorities. He edited his prior work. He expanded the scope of his earlier research, and further developed his interviewing methods. He recast his project along the lines of the medieval [[encyclopedias]]. These were not encyclopedias in the contemporary sense, and can be better described as worldbooks, for they attempt to provide a relatively complete presentation of knowledge about the world.&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Keen, ''The Journey of a Book: Bartholomew the Englishman and the Properties of Things'' (Canberra: ANU E-press, 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methodologies==
Sahagún was among the first to develop methods and strategies for gathering and validating knowledge of indigenous New World cultures. Much later, the scientific discipline of [[anthropology]] would formalize the methods of [[ethnography]] as a scientific research strategy for documenting the beliefs, behavior, social roles and relationships, and worldview of another culture, and for explaining these factors with reference to the logic of that culture. His research methods and strategies for validating information provided by his informants are precursors of the methods and strategies of modern ethnography.

He systematically gathered knowledge from a range of diverse informants, including women, who were recognized as having knowledge of indigenous culture and tradition. He compared the answers obtained from his various sources. Some passages in his writings appear to be transcriptions of informants' statements about religious beliefs, society or nature. Other passages clearly reflect a consistent set of questions presented to different informants with the aim of eliciting information on specific topics. Some passages reflect Sahagún's own narration of events or commentary.

==Significance==
During the period in which Sahagún conducted his research, the conquering Spaniards were greatly outnumbered by the conquered Aztecs, and were concerned about the threat of a native uprising. Some colonial authorities perceived his writings as potentially dangerous, since they lent credibility to native voices and perspectives. Sahagún was aware of the need to avoid running afoul of the [[Inquisition]], which was established in Mexico in 1570.

Sahagún's work was originally conducted only in Nahuatl. To fend off suspicion and criticism, he translated sections of it into Spanish, submitted it to some fellow Franciscans for their review, and sent it to the King of Spain with some Friars returning home. His last years were difficult, because the utopian idealism of the first Franciscans in New Spain was fading while the Spanish colonial project continued as brutal and exploitative. In addition, millions of indigenous people died from repeated epidemics, as they had no immunity to Eurasian diseases. Some of his final writings express feelings of despair. The Crown replaced the religious orders with secular clergy, giving friars a much smaller role in the Catholic life of the colony. Franciscans newly arrived in the colony did not share the earlier Franciscans' faith and zeal about the capacity of the Indians. The pro-indigenous approach of the Franciscans and Sahagún became marginalized with passing years. The use of the Nahuatl Bible was banned, reflecting the broader global retrenchment of Catholicism under the [[Council of Trent]].

Sahagún's ''Historia general'' was unknown outside Spain for about two centuries. In 1793 a bibliographer catalogued the ''Florentine Codex'' in the [[Laurentian Library]] in Florence.&lt;ref&gt;Angelo Maria Bandini, ''Bibliotheca Leopldina Laurentiana, seu Catalofus Manuscriptorum qui nuper in Laurentiana translati sunt''. Florence: typis Regiis, 1791-1793.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dibble, "Sahagun's ''Historia''", p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; The work is now carefully rebound in three volumes. A scholarly community of historians, anthropologists, art historians, and linguists has been investigating Sahagun's work, its subtleties and mysteries, for more than 200 years.&lt;ref&gt;For a history of this scholarly work, see Charles E. Dibble, "Sahagún's ''Historia'' in ''Florentine Codex: Introductions and Indices''. Salt Lake City: University of Utah Press 1982, pp.9-23; León-Portilla, ''Bernardino De Sahagún: The First Anthropologist.''&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Historia general'' is the product one of the most remarkable social-science research projects ever conducted. It is not unique as a chronicle of encounters with the new world and its people, but it stands out due to Sahagún's effort to gather information about a foreign culture by querying people and perspectives from within that culture.  "The scope of the Historia’s coverage of contact-period Central Mexico indigenous culture is remarkable, unmatched by any other sixteenth-century works that attempted to describe the native way of life.”&lt;ref&gt;Nicholson, "Fray Bernardino De Sahagún: A Spanish Missionary in New Spain, 1529-1590." page 27.&lt;/ref&gt; Foremost in his own mind, Sahagún was a Franciscan missionary, but he may also rightfully be given the title of father of American Ethnography.&lt;ref name="Arthur J.O. Anderson 1982, p. 40"/&gt;

==As a Franciscan Friar==
Sahagún has been described as a missionary, ethnographer, linguist, folklorist, Renaissance humanist, historian and pro-indigenous.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"/&gt;  Scholars have explained these roles as emerging from his identity as a missionary priest,&lt;ref name="eschatological1"/&gt; a participant in the Spanish evangelical fervor for converting newly encountered peoples,&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"&gt;Sylvest, ''Motifs of Franciscan Mission Theory in Sixteenth Century New Spain Province of the Holy Gospel.''&lt;/ref&gt; and as a part of the broader Franciscan millenarian project.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1970"/&gt;

Founded by [[Francis of Assisi]] in the early 13th century, the Franciscan Friars emphasized devotion to the [[Incarnation]], the humanity of [[Jesus Christ]]. Saint Francis developed and articulated this devotion based on his experiences of contemplative prayer in front the San Damiano Crucifix and the practice of compassion among lepers and social outcasts. Franciscan prayer includes the conscious remembering of the human life of Jesus&lt;ref&gt;Ewert Cousins, "Francis of Assisi and Bonaventure: Mysticism and Theological Interpretation," in ''The Other Side of God,'' ed. Peter L. Berger (New York: Anchor Press, 1981), Ewert Cousins, "Francis of Assisi: Christian Mysticism at the Crossroads," in ''Mysticism and Religious Traditions,'' ed. S. Katz (New York: Oxford, 1983).&lt;/ref&gt; and the practice of care for the poor and marginalized.

Saint Francis’ intuitive approach was elaborated into a philosophical vision by subsequent Franciscan theologians, such as [[Saint Bonaventura|Bonaventure of Bagnoregio]] and [[John Duns Scotus]], leading figures in the Franciscan intellectual tradition. The philosophy of Scotus is founded upon the primacy of the Incarnation, and may have been a particularly important influence on Sahagún, since Scotus’s philosophy was taught in Spain at this time. Scotus absorbed the intuitive insights of St. Francis of Assisi and his devotion to Jesus Christ as a human being, and expressed them in a broader vision of humanity.

A religious philosophical anthropology — a vision of humanity — may shape a missionary’s vision of human beings, and in turn the missionary's behavior on a cultural frontier.&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"/&gt;  The pro-indigenous approach of the Franciscan missionaries in New Spain is consistent with the philosophy of Franciscan John Duns Scotus. In particular, he outlined a philosophical anthropology that reflects a Franciscan spirit.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Beth Ingham, CSJ, ''Scotus for Dunces: An Introduction to the Subtle Doctor'' (St. Bonaventure, NY: Franciscan Institute Publications, 2003).&lt;/ref&gt;

Several specific dimensions of Sahagún's work (and that of other Franciscans in New Spain) reflect this philosophical anthropology. The native peoples were believed to have dignity and merited respect as human beings. The friars were, for the most part, deeply disturbed by the conquistadores' abuse of the native peoples. In Sahagún's collaborative approach, in which he consistently gave credit to his collaborators, especially [[Antonio Valeriano]], the Franciscan value of community is expressed.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Ricard, ''The Spiritual Conquest of Mexico,'' Translated by Lesley Byrd Simpson. Berkeley: University of California Press 1966, p.42.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his five decades of research, he practiced a Franciscan philosophy of knowledge in action. He was not content to speculate about these new peoples, but met with, interviewed and interpreted them and their worldview as an expression of his faith. While others – in Europe and [[New Spain]] – were debating whether or not the indigenous peoples were human and had souls, Sahagún was interviewing them, seeking to understand who they were, how they loved each other, what they believed, and how they made sense of the world. He fell in love with their culture. Even as he expressed disgust at their continuing practice of human sacrifice and their idolatries, he spent five decades investigating Aztec culture.

==Disillusionment with the "spiritual conquest"==
Learning more about Aztec culture, Sahagún grew increasingly skeptical of the depth of the mass conversions in Mexico. He thought that many if not most of the conversions were superficial. He also became concerned about the tendency of his fellow Franciscan missionaries to misunderstand basic elements of traditional Aztec religious beliefs and cosmology. He became convinced that only by mastering native languages and worldviews could missionaries be effective in dealing with the Aztec people.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt;  He began informal studies of indigenous peoples, their beliefs, and religious practices.

In the Florentine Codex, Sahagún wrote numerous introductions, addresses "to the reader", and interpolations in which he expresses his own views in Spanish.&lt;ref&gt;Bernardino de Sahagún, ''Florentine Codex: Introductions and Indices'', Arthur J.O. Anderson and Charles Dibble, translators.  Salt Lake City: University of Utah Press 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;  In Book XI, ''The Earthly Things,'' he replaces a Spanish translation of Nahuatl entries on mountains and rocks to describe current idolatrous practices among the people. "Having discussed the springs, waters, and mountains, this seemed to me to be the opportune place to discuss the principal idolatries which were practiced and are still practiced in the waters and mountains."&lt;ref&gt;Sahagún, ''Florentine Codex: Introduction and Indices'', p.89.&lt;/ref&gt;

In this section, Sahagún denounces the association of the [[Virgin of Guadalupe]] with a pagan Meso-American deity. The Franciscans were then particularly hostile to this cult because of its potential for idolatrous practice, as it conflated the Virgin Mary with an ancient goddess. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;At this place [Tepeyac], [the Indians] had a temple dedicated to the mother of the gods, whom they called Tonantzin, which means Our Mother. There they performed many sacrifices in honor of this goddess...And now that a church of Our Lady of Guadalupe is built there, they also call her Tonantzin, being motivated by the preachers who called Our Lady, the Mother of God, Tonantzin. It is not known for certain where the beginning of this Tonantzin may have originated, but this we know for certain, that, from its first usage, the word means that ancient Tonantzin. And it is something that should be remedied, for the correct [native] name of the Mother of God, Holy Mary, is not Tonantzin, but ''Dios inantzin''. It appears to be a Satanic invention to cloak idolatry under the confusion of this name, Tonantzin.&lt;ref name="Sahagún, p. 90"&gt;Sahagún, ''Florentine Codex: Introduction and Indices'', p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Sahagún explains that a church of Santa Ana has become a pilgrimage site for Toci (Nahuatl: "our grandmother"). He acknowledges that Saint Ann is the mother of the Virgin Mary, and therefore literally the grandmother of Jesus, but Sahagún writes:  
&lt;blockquote&gt;All the people who come, as in times past, to the feast of Toci, come on the pretext of Saint Ann, but since the word [grandmother] is ambiguous, and they respect the olden ways, it is believable that they come more for the ancient than the modern. And thus, also in this place, idolatry appears to be cloaked because so many people come from such distant lands without Saint Ann's ever having performed any miracles there. It is more apparent that it is the ancient Toci rather than Saint Ann [whom they worship].&lt;ref name="Sahagún, p. 90"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

But in this same section, Sahagún expressed his profound doubt that the Christian evangelization of the Indians would last in New Spain, particularly since the devastating plague of 1576 decimated the indigenous population and tested the survivors. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;[A]s regards the Catholic Faith, [Mexico] is a sterile land and very laborious to cultivate, where the Catholic Faith has very shallow roots, and with much labor little fruit is produced, and from little cause that which is planted and cultivated withers. It seems to me the Catholic Faith can endure little time in these parts...And now, in the time of this plague, having tested the faith of those who come to confess, very few respond properly prior to the confession; thus we can be certain that, though preached to more than fifty years, if they were now left alone, if the Spanish nation were not to intercede, I am certain that in less than fifty years there would be no trace of the preaching which has been done for them.&lt;ref&gt;Sahagún, ''Florentine Codex: Introduction and Indices'', pp.93-94,98.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Sahagún's histories of the conquest==
Sahagún wrote two versions of the conquest of Mexico, the first is Book 12 of the ''General History'' (1576) and the second is a revision completed in 1585. The version in the ''Historia General'' is the only narration of historical events, as opposed to information on general topics such as religious beliefs and practices and social structure.  The 1576 text is exclusively from an indigenous, largely Tlatelolcan viewpoint.&lt;ref&gt;Alfredo Lopez-Austin. "The Research Method of Fray Bernardino de Sahagún: The Questionnaires," in  ''Sixteenth-Century Mexico: The Work of Sahagún.'' Edited by Munro S. Edmonson, 111-49.  Albuquerque: University of New Mexico Press 1974.&lt;/ref&gt;  He revised the account in 1585 in important ways, adding passages praising the Spanish, especially the conqueror [[Hernan Cortés]], rather than adhering to the indigenous viewpoint.&lt;ref&gt;S.L. Cline, "Revisionist Conquest History: Sahagún's Book XII," in ''The Work of Bernardino de Sahagún: Pioneer Ethnographer of Sixteenth-Century Aztec Mexico''. Ed. Jorge Klor de Alva et al. Institute for Mesoamerican Studies, Studies on Culture and Society, vol. 2, 93-106. Albany: State University of New York, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;  The original of the 1585 manuscript is lost. In the late 20th century, a handwritten copy in Spanish was found by John B. Glass in the [[Boston Public Library]], and has been published in facsimile and English translation, with comparisons to Book 12 of the General History.&lt;ref&gt;Fray Bernardino de Sahagún, ''Conquest of New Spain, 1585 Revision.'' Translation by Howard F. Cline. Introduction and notes by S.L. Cline. Salt Lake City, University of Utah Press 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;  In his introduction ("To the reader") to Book 12 of the ''Historia General,'' Sahagún claimed the history of the conquest was a linguistic tool so that friars would know the language of warfare and weapons.&lt;ref&gt;Bernardino de Sahagún, ''Florentine Codex: General History of the Things of New Spain, Introductions and Indices'', Arthur J.O. Anderson and Charles Dibble, translators. Salt Lake City: University of Utah Press 1982, p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt;  Since compiling a history of the conquest from the point of view of the defeated Tenochtitlan-Tlatelolcan could be controversial for the Spanish crown, Sahagún may have been prudent in trying to shape how the history was perceived.&lt;ref&gt;S.L. Cline, "Introduction" Fray Bernardino de Sahagún, ''Conquest of New Spain, 1585 Revision'', Salt Lake City, University of Utah Press 1989, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; Sahagún's 1585 revision of the conquest narrative, which included praise for Cortés and the Spanish conquest, was completed in a period when work on indigenous texts was under attack. Sahagún likely wrote this version with that political situation well in mind, when a narrative of the conquest entirely from the defeated Mexicans' viewpoint was suspect.&lt;ref&gt;Cline, "Revisionist Conquest History".&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Birgu''' ({{lang-mt|Il-Birgu}} {{IPA-mt|ɪlˈbɪrɡʊ|}}, {{lang-it|Vittoriosa}}), also known by its title '''Città Vittoriosa''' ("''Victorious City''"), is an old [[Fortifications of Birgu|fortified]] city on the south side of the [[Grand Harbour]] in the [[South Eastern Region]] of [[Malta]]. The city occupies a promontory of land with [[Fort Saint Angelo]] at its head and the city of [[Cospicua]] at its base. Birgu is ideally situated for safe anchorage, and over time it has developed a very long history with maritime, mercantile and military activities.

Birgu is a very old locality with its origins reaching back to medieval times. Prior to the establishment of [[Valletta]] as capital and main city of Malta, military powers that wanted to rule the Maltese islands would need to obtain control of Birgu due to its significant position in the Grand Harbour. In fact, it served as the base of the [[Knights Hospitaller|Order of Saint John]] and ''de facto'' capital city of Malta from 1530 to 1571. Birgu is well known for its vital role in the [[Great Siege of Malta]] of 1565.

In the early 20th century, Birgu had a population of over 6000 people. Over the years this decreased, and the population stood at 2,629 in March 2014.

==History==
[[File:Fort Saint-Angelo de La Valette.jpg|thumb|[[Fort Saint Angelo]]]]

Phoenicians, Greeks, Romans, Byzantines, Arabs, Normans, the Angevines, the Aragonese and the [[Knights Hospitaller|Order of Saint John]] all contributed to the development of Birgu.&lt;ref&gt;Gauci,G. Birgu: History and Traditions of a Medieval and Maritime City&lt;/ref&gt; After being driven out of Rhodes by the [[Ottoman Empire]], the Order of Saint John were granted Malta as their new home. In 1526, the Order sent a commission made up of eight knights to Malta, representing each of the [[Langue (Knights Hospitaller)|langues]]. They described Birgu as a small defenceless town with old houses in poor condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2007-01-10/news/the-auberges-of-france-in-birgu-167442/|last=Zahra|first=Lorenzo A.|authorlink=Lorenzo A. Zahra|title=The Auberges of France in Birgu
|work=[[The Malta Independent]]|date=10 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; When they arrived in 1530, they decided to make Birgu the capital city of Malta, since the former capital, [[Mdina]], was inland and did not suit their naval requirements.&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/03/01/magazine/malta-emerges-from-the-waves-of-time.html?pagewanted=4&amp;src=pm|last=Stille|first=Alexander|authorlink=Alexander Stille|title=Malta, Emerges From the Waves of Time|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=1 March 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city was fortified in the 1530s and strengthened in the 1550s in preparation for an attack by the Ottoman Empire. This included the construction of the Castle of [[Fort St Angelo|St Angelo]], a large fortification separated from the city by a narrow channel, instead of the ancient ''Castrum Maris''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=e7INAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA117|last=Martin|first=Robert Montgomery|authorlink=Robert Montgomery Martin|title=The British colonies: their history, extent, condition and resources|publisher=London Printing and Publishing Company|year=1850|page=117}}&lt;/ref&gt; The castle was connected to the city by means of a drawbridge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=lCoLAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA164&amp;dq=history+of+vittoriosa#v=onepage&amp;q=vittoriosa&amp;f=false|last=Gifford|first=C. H.|title=History of the wars occasioned by the French Revolution, from the commencement of hostilities in 1792, to the end of 1816|publisher=W. Lewis|year=1817|page=164}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Birgu was the site of major battles between the Knights and the Ottoman Empire during the [[Great Siege of Malta]] in 1565. After four months of successful defence by the Knights, the city was almost captured by the Ottoman army in August, but was recaptured by the Knights under Grand Master [[Jean Parisot de Valette]]. Reinforcements from Sicily arrived a month later, and the siege was abandoned by the Ottomans. After this, a new capital city was built on Mount Sceberras, bearing the name [[Valletta]]. In 1571, the Knights transferred their convent and seat to the new capital and Birgu lost some of its importance. Despite this, after the Siege, Birgu was given the title ''Città Vittoriosa'', Italian for "victorious city".&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt;

After the [[French occupation of Malta|taking of Malta]] by [[Napoleon]] in 1798, French forces were garrisoned in the city. Soon after the Maltese rebelled and the Grand Harbour area was [[Siege of Malta (1798–1800)|blockaded]] by Maltese rebels aided by Britain, Portugal and Naples. The French eventually capitulated in September 1800, and Malta became a [[Malta Protectorate|British protectorate]]. The Royal Navy's [[Mediterranean Fleet]] established its base in Birgu, and British forces remained stationed in Birgu until 1979.

In 1806, Birgu's gunpowder magazine [[1806 Birgu polverista explosion|exploded]], killing over 200 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Explosion Polverista Vittoriosa|url=https://www.maltaramc.com/regsurg/rs1800_1809/rmo1806.html|website=Medical Officers of the Malta Garrison|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170222050937/http://maltaramc.com/regsurg/rs1800_1809/rmo1806.html|archivedate=22 February 2017|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Birgu was heavily bombed during [[World War II]] due to its proximity to the [[Malta Dockyard]]. A number of historic buildings were destroyed, including the [[Birgu Clock Tower]] and the [[Auberge d'Allemagne, Birgu|Auberge d'Allemagne]].

In recent years, due to an agreement made by the Maltese Government with [[Sovereign Military Order of Malta]], this Catholic Order of Knighthood has returned to the Island. This agreement, which has a duration of 99 years, grants the Knights of Malta the exclusive use of Fort St Angelo in Birgu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sovereign Order of Malta - Official Site-The Order and its Institutions-Mission|url=http://www.orderofmalta.org/the-order-and-its-institutions/225/mission/?lang=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100807093745/http://www.orderofmalta.org/the-order-and-its-institutions/225/mission/?lang=en|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2010-08-07|accessdate=2010-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attractions==
Birgu is the location of several tourist attractions. The historic Vittoriosa Waterfront contains the former Palace of the General of the Galleys and the Order of St John's treasury. The area was refurbished in the early 2000s, and both buildings are used for other activities: the former is now a [[casino]], while the latter is home to the [[Malta Maritime Museum]].&lt;ref name="FT"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/e8f6f77c-c92d-11db-9f7b-000b5df10621.html#axzz1RFYCxqgH|last=Grima|first=Godfrey|title=Three times the value|work=[[Financial Times]]|date=3 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; A second museum, the Vittoriosa 1565 Museum, is also located in the town and is dedicated to the siege and the battle in the town in 1565.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=FmSF1CLkV74C&amp;pg=PA239&amp;dq=%22vittoriosa+1565+museum%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22vittoriosa%201565%20museum%22&amp;f=false |last1=Borowski |first1=Birgit |last2=Strüber |first2=Reinhard |title=Malta, Gozo, Comino |publisher=Mairdumont |year=2008 |page=239 |isbn=3-8297-1112-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[St. Lawrence's Church, Vittoriosa|St. Lawrence's Church]], one of several churches in the parish, was once the Conventual Church of the Order of St John. It is dedicated to [[Lawrence of Rome|St. Lawrence of Rome]], and the feast is very popular among locals for the decorations in the local streets. The celebrations start on 31 July and continue till 10 August, the saint's feast day.&lt;ref name="Restore" /&gt; Other churches in Birgu include the [[Monastery of St. Scholastica]] and the [[Our Lady of Annunciation Church]] which is run by the [[Dominican Order]].

==Demographics==
In 1901, Birgu had a population of 6,093 people. After falling slightly over the following 20 years, this figure had increased to 6,673 in 1931.

'''David Rogers Chesnutt''' (1940 – December 15, 2014) was an American historian and editor.

==Life==
Chesnutt was born in Athens, Alabama, and earned academic degrees at [[University of Alabama]] (1962), [[Auburn University]] (1967) and the [[University of Georgia]] (1973).&lt;ref name='sedit'&gt;{{cite web|url=https://listserv.umd.edu/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind1412&amp;L=sedit-l&amp;P=742 |title=SEDIT-L archives - December 2014 (#7) |publisher=Listserv.umd.edu |date=2014-12-15 |accessdate=2015-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chesnutt was in the History Department at the University of South Carolina for  35 years as Research Professor. His major work was ''The Papers of [[Henry Laurens]]'', serving as Associate Editor and then Editor.  As part of that project he was influential in moving the [[scholarly editing]] project to digital technologies, which was ground-breaking at the time.&lt;ref name='sedit'/&gt;

For more than two decades Chesnutt served on the [[South Carolina Historical Records Advisory Board]].&lt;ref name='sedit'/&gt; He was an important figure in the foundation and early development of the [[Text Encoding Initiative]] and active in the  [[Association for Computers and the Humanities]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Syd Bauman-7 |url=http://tei-l.970651.n3.nabble.com/David-R-Chesnutt-td4026727.html |title=tei-l - David R.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2292">'''Democratic rationalization''' is term used by [[Andrew Feenberg]] in his article "Subversive Rationalization: Technology, Power and Democracy with technology."  Feenberg argues against the idea of ''[[technological determinism]]'' citing flaws in its two fundamental theses.

The first is the ''thesis of unilinear progress''.  This is the belief that technological progress follows a direct and predictable path from lower to higher levels of complexity and that each stage along this path is necessary for progress to occur ([[Feenberg]] 211).

The second is the ''thesis of determination by the base''.  This is the concept that  in a society where a technology had been introduced, that society must organize itself or adapt to the technology ([[Feenberg]] 211).

In his argument against the former thesis [[Feenberg]] says that [[Constructivist epistemology|constructivist]] studies of technology will lead us to realize that there is not a set path by which development of technologies occur but rather an emerging of similar technologies at the same time leading to a multiplicity of choices.  These choices are made based upon certain social factors and upon examining them we will see that they are not deterministic in nature ([[Feenberg]] 212).

Arguing against the latter thesis, [[Feenberg]] calls to our attention social reforms that have been mandated by governments mainly in regards to the protection of its citizens and laborers.  Most of the time these mandates are widely accepted after being passed through the governing body. At which point technology and industry will reform and re-evolve to meet the new standards in a way that has greater efficiency than it did so previously ([[Feenberg]] 214)

The '''Elunin culture''' ([[Russian language|Russian]]: Eлунинская культура) is an indigenous [[Bronze Age]] culture of animal breeders in the steppe and forest-steppe area of the [[Ob River|Ob]]-[[Irtysh]] rivers of [[Altai Mountains|Altai]] foothill-plain zone in [[Siberia]], developed from the local [[Bolshemys culture|Bolshemys]] [[Eneolithic]] culture, dated around 2300–1700 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Grushin S.P., ''Pottery Industry of Elunino Culture Population''&lt;/ref&gt; 

The monuments of this early and advanced bronze-producing culture number more than 50 settlements and cemeteries. Burial complexes include ground (non-[[kurgan]]) burial sites of Elunin, Staroaley, Tsygan Sopka, Wolf Cape, etc. The culture was named after the Elunin cemetery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.althisto.ru/bronzovyiy-vek-altaya/rannyaya-bronza.html |title=althisto.ru |publisher=Althisto.ru |accessdate=23 October 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141028195943/http://www.althisto.ru/bronzovyiy-vek-altaya/rannyaya-bronza.html |archivedate=28 October 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Elunin culture was discovered and described by Yu. F. Kiryushin in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;Degtyarev A. D. et al., ''Metalwork of Elunin Culture''  p.27&lt;/ref&gt;

The tribes of the Elunin culture, along with the [[Krotov culture|Krotov]] and [[Loginov culture|Loginov]] cultures, were involved in formation of the [[Seima-Turbino Phenomenon|Seima-Turbinsky transcultural phenomenon]] of numerous bronze tools and weapons, and highly developed casting technology. 

Funerary monuments and settlements of the Elunin culture are known to include tools and weapons of the Seima-Turbinsky types, including knives, celts, spearheads, and molds for casting celts and spearheads.&lt;ref&gt;Degtyarev A.D. et al., ''Metalwork of Elunin Culture'' p.27&lt;/ref&gt;

==Genetic composition==
The Elunin culture is well-studied, its dating is supported by radiocarbon measurements, the metal production tested and analyzed, animal bones investigated, and produced genetic studies. The culture was formed by interaction of migrants, who brought with them tradition of bronze metallurgy and advanced animal husbandry, with the local mix of Caucasoid-Mongoloid substrate. According to A. Tishkin, who excavated Elunin monuments, molecular testing points to interaction between migrant Caucasoid ethnic groups and indigenous Mongoloid-Caucasoid mixed populations in the foothills and plains area of the Altai's Upper Ob at the end of the 3rd millennium BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Tishkin
 A.A., ''Comprehensive Approach in Study of the Monument Berezov Bend''//Northern Eurasia in Bronze Age: Space, Time, Culture. Barnaul, Altai University, 2002, p. 183&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, the migration wave of [[Andronovo culture|Andronovo]] cultural-historical community tribes pushed inhabitants of the [[Altai-Sayan]] foothills to the north toward the southern [[taiga]] zone, where their physical type (anthropologically ascended to the Southern Eurasian Anthropological Formation) conflated with local tribes (anthropologically ascended to the Northern Eurasian Anthropological Formation) and went on ethnogenesis of the Andronoid cultures.&lt;ref&gt;Chikisheva T.A., ''"Dynamics of anthropological differentiation"'', section Conclusions&lt;/ref&gt; The phenotype features of Elunin people are distinctive. The Elunin culture developed from the local [[Bolshemys culture|Bolshemys]] Eneolithic culture. In its formation participated a Caucasoid population of Eastern Mediterranean type, migrants from Central Asia. The migration started in the Eneolithic period and continued in the early and advanced bronze periods. Another ethnic component was associated with the East, and possibly northern Kazakhstan, they were people with ceramic comb-patch ornamentation, traceable to the nearest early Andronovo tribes of East [[Kazakhstan]]. Penetration starts in the final stages of the Elunin culture, and coincides with the area of Bolshemys settlements. The northern boundary of the penetration lies in the [[Novosibirsk Oblast]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.althisto.ru/bronzovyiy-vek-altaya/stratigraficheskie-nablyudeniya.html|title=althisto.ru|publisher=Althisto.ru|accessdate=23 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economy==
The mainstay of the Elunin economy was extensive animal husbandry, illustrated by tens of thousands bones and bone fragments found in a single settlement. The composition of the herds was 60% sheep, 25% horses, and 15% cattle.&lt;ref&gt;Tishkin A.A., ''Comprehensive Approach'', p. 183&lt;/ref&gt;

'''First-wave feminism''' was a period of [[feminist]] activity and thought that occurred during the 19th and early 20th century throughout the Western world. It focused on [[De jure|legal]] issues, primarily on gaining [[women's suffrage|the right to vote]].

The term ''first-wave'' was coined in March 1968 by Martha Lear writing in ''[[The New York Times Magazine]]'', who at the same time also used the term "[[second-wave feminism]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W4U4Ss1OZGoC&amp;pg=PA58 |page=58 |title=Not My Mother's Sister: Generational Conflict and Third-Wave Feminism |last=Henry |first=Astrid |year=2004 |publisher=Indiana University Press |isbn=9780253111227}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://bccfeministphilosophy.wordpress.com/tag/first-wave-feminism/ First Wave Feminism | BCC Feminist Philosophy&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, the women's movement was focused on ''[[de facto]]'' (unofficial) inequalities, which it wished to distinguish from the objectives of the earlier feminists.

According to Miriam Schneir, [[Simone de Beauvoir]] wrote that the first woman to "take up her pen in defense of her sex" was [[Christine de Pizan]] in the 15th century.&lt;ref name=Schneir-1994&gt;{{cite book|author=Schneir, Miram|title=Feminism: The Essential Historical Writings|year=1994|first=1972|publisher=Vintage Books|page=xiv|isbn=0-679-75381-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa]] and [[Modesta di Pozzo di Forzi]] worked in the 16th century.&lt;ref name=Schneir-1994 /&gt; [[Marie le Jars de Gournay]], [[Anne Bradstreet]] and [[François Poullain de la Barre]]'s [[Equality of sexes]] came out in 1673.&lt;ref name=Schneir-1994 /&gt;

=== Wollstonecraft ===
{{Main|Mary Wollstonecraft}}

The period in which [[Mary Wollstonecraft]] wrote was affected by [[Rousseau]] and the philosophy of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]. The father of the Enlightenment defined an ideal democratic society that was based on the equality of men, where women were often discriminated against. The inherent exclusion of women from discussion was addressed by both Wollstonecraft, and her contemporaries.  Wollstonecraft based her work on the ideas of Rousseau.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Reuter|first=Martina|year=2017|title=Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Mary Wollstonecraft on the imagination|doi=10.1080/09608788.2017.1334188|journal=British Journal for the History of Philosophy|volume=25|issue=6|pages=1138–1160}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although at first it seems to be contradictory, Wollstonecraft's idea was to expand Rousseau's democratic society but based on [[gender equality]].

Wollstonecraft published one of the first feminist treatises, ''[[A Vindication of the Rights of Woman]]'' (1792), in which she advocated the social and moral equality of the sexes, extending the work of her 1790 pamphlet, ''[[A Vindication of the Rights of Men]]''. Her later unfinished novel, ''[[Maria: or, The Wrongs of Woman|Maria, or the Wrongs of Woman]]'', earned her considerable criticism as she discussed women's sexual desires. She died young, and her widower, the philosopher [[William Godwin]], quickly wrote [[Memoirs of the Author of A Vindication of the Rights of Woman|a memoir of her]] that, contrary to his intentions, destroyed her reputation for generations.

Wollstonecraft is regarded as the "fore-mother" of [[Feminist history in the United Kingdom|the British feminist movement]] and her ideas shaped the thinking of the [[suffragette]]s, who campaigned for the women's vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tauchert|first1=Ashley|title=Mary Wollstonecraft and the Accent of the Feminine|date=2002|publisher=Palgrave|location=New York|isbn=9780230287358|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Early American efforts ===

Early Feminism was directly correlated with the [[abolitionist movement]]s and as a result many famous feminists and activists began to have their voices heard. Some of these early activists include, [[Sojourner Truth]], [[Elizabeth Blackwell]], [[Jane Addams]], and [[Dorothy Day]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.feministsforlife.org/herstory/|title=Feminist History|website=Feminists for Life|access-date=2017-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first wave of feminism was primarily led by white women in the middle class, and it was not until the [[Second-wave feminism|second wave of feminism]] that women of color began developing a voice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pacificu.edu/about-us/news-events/four-waves-feminism|title=Four Waves of Feminism|website=Pacific University|access-date=2017-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term Feminism was created like a political illustrated ideology at that period. Feminism emerged by the speech about the reform and correction of democracy based on equalitarian conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Offen|first=Karen|year=1988|title=Defining Feminism: A Comparative Historical Approach|doi=10.1086/494494|journal=Signs|volume=14|issue=1|pages=119–157}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Australia ==
The first wave of Australian feminism, which dates back to the late 19th century, was chiefly concerned with suffrage (women's right to vote) and consequently with women's access to parliaments and other political activities.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/ola/citizen/women/women-power.htm#3 |title=Women, Power and The Public Sphere |first=Anita |last=Seibert |first2=Dorota |last2=Roslaniec |publisher=Abc.net.au |accessdate=2012-09-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121001100954/http://www.abc.net.au/ola/citizen/women/women-power.htm#3 |archivedate=2012-10-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1882, [[Rose Scott]], a [[women's rights]] activist, began to hold a weekly salon meetings in her Sydney home left to her by her late mother. Through these meetings, she became well known amongst politicians, judges, philanthropists, writers and poets. In 1889, she helped to found the Women's Literary Society, which later grew into the Womanhood Suffrage League in 1891. Leading politicians hosted by Scott included [[Bernhard Ringrose Wise]], [[William Holman]], [[William Morris Hughes]] and [[Thomas Bavin]], who met and discussed the drafting of the bill that eventually became the Early Closing Act of 1899.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/num_act/eca1899n38176.pdf |title=Early Closing Act 1899 No 38 |format=PDF |accessdate=2012-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Denmark==
The first women's movement was led by the ''[[Dansk Kvindesamfund]]'' ("Danish Women's Society"), founded in 1871. [[Line Luplau]] was one of the most notable woman in this era. [[Tagea Brandt]] was also part of this movement, and in her honor was established the [[Tagea Brandt Rejselegat]] or Travel Scholarship for women. The Dansk Kvindesamfund's efforts as a leading group of women for women led to the existence of the revised Danish constitution of 1915, giving women the right to vote and the provision of equal opportunity laws during the 1920s, which influenced the present-day legislative measures to grant women access to education, work, marital rights and other obligations.&lt;ref name=KV1&gt;{{cite web|last=Larsen|first=Jytte|title=The women's movement in Denmark|url=http://www.kvinfo.dk/side/680/article/3/|work=Translated by Gaye Kynoch|publisher=[[KVINFO]]|accessdate=17 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== New Zealand ==
Early New Zealand feminists and suffragettes included [[Maud Pember Reeves]] (Australian-born; later lived in London), [[Kate Sheppard]] and [[Mary Ann Müller]]. In 1893, [[Elizabeth Yates (mayor)|Elizabeth Yates]] became Mayor of [[Onehunga]], the first time such a post had been held by a female anywhere in the [[British Empire]]. Early university graduates were [[Emily Siedeberg]] (doctor, graduated 1895) and [[Ethel Benjamin]] (lawyer, graduated 1897). The Female Law Practitioners Act was passed in 1896 and Benjamin was admitted as a barrister and solicitor of the Supreme Court of New Zealand in 1897 (see [[Women's suffrage in New Zealand]]).

==Netherlands==
[[File:Wilhelmina Drucker IMG0020.tif|thumb|In the Netherlands, [[Wilhelmina Drucker]] (1847–1925) fought successfully for the vote and equal rights for women through political and feminist organisations she founded.]]
&lt;!-- [[File:Aletta Jacobs door Isaac Israels 1920.jpg|thumb|Isaac Israels: Aletta Jacobs, 1920. Oil on canvas.]] --&gt;
Although in the Netherlands during the [[Age of Enlightenment]] the idea of the equality of women and men made progress, no practical institutional measures or legislation resulted. In the second half of the nineteenth century many initiatives by feminists sprung up in The Netherlands. [[Aletta Jacobs]] (1854–1929) requested and obtained as the first woman in the Netherlands the right to study at university in 1871, becoming the first female medical doctor and academic. She became a lifelong campaigner for [[women's suffrage]], equal rights, birth control, and international peace, travelling worldwide for, e.g., the [[International Alliance of Women]]. [[Wilhelmina Drucker]] (1847–1925) was a politician, a prolific writer and a peace activist, who fought for the vote and equal rights through political and feminist organisations she founded. In 1917–1919 her goal of women's suffrage was reached.

==Persia==
While in some distance in culture and language, the events of the [[Conference of Badasht]] (1848) presented progress on the concerns of first-wave feminism. There is a synchronicity in time and a likeness in theme and events between Persia (later named Iran) and the United States between the conference at Badasht and the [[Seneca Falls Convention]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Miller |first=Bradford W. |title=Seneca Falls First Woman's Rights Convention of 1848; The Sacred Rites of the Nation |journal=Journal of Bahá'í Studies |volume=8 |issue=3 |publisher=Association for Bahá'í Studies |year=1998 |language= |url=http://www.bahai-studies.ca/journal/files/jbs/8.3%20Miller.pdf |accessdate=2012-04-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120428165606/http://www.bahai-studies.ca/journal/files/jbs/8.3%20Miller.pdf |archivedate=2012-04-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Penn | first =Michael L. |author2=Rahel Nardos | title =Overcoming violence against women and girls: the international campaign to eradicate a worldwide problem | publisher =Rowman &amp; Littlefield | edition =illustrated | year =2003 | pages =1–2 |url =https://books.google.com/books?id=yfpCY3PdpDoC | isbn = 978-0-7425-2500-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; First the conference happened over three weeks from late June to mid-July 1848 and the Seneca Falls Convention happened in mid-July 1848. Both conferences had women ([[Tahirih]] and [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]]) take strong stances on the role of women in the public arena that some attending reacted to harshly. And lastly leading men present ([[Quddús]] and [[Frederick Douglass]]) supported these calls during the meetings healing the breach. Some even see a parallel in the background discussions that are partially documented to arrange how things would be brought up and settled.

The conference of Badasht is considered by [[Bahá'ís]] as a signal moment that demonstrated that Islamic [[Sharia]] law had been abrogated&lt;ref name="holy"&gt;{{Cite book |title = Holy People of the World: A Cross-cultural Encyclopedia | editor-first = Phyllis G. |editor-last = Jestice | year = 2004 | publisher = ABC-CLIO | isbn = 1-57607-355-6| first = Moojan | last=Momen | first2=B.

==Sweden==
Feminist issues and gender roles were discussed in media and literature during the 18th century by people such as [[Margareta Momma]], [[Catharina Ahlgren]], [[Anna Maria Rückerschöld]] and [[Hedvig Charlotta Nordenflycht]], but it created no movement of any kind. The first person to hold public speeches and agitate in favor of feminism was [[Sophie Sager]] in 1848,&lt;ref&gt;Kyle, Gunhild; Krusenstjerna, Eva von (1993). Kvinnoprofiler. Panorama ([[Natur &amp; Kultur]]), 99-0913791-7. Stockholm: Natur och kultur.&lt;/ref&gt; and the first organization created to deal with a women's issue was ''Svenska lärarinnors pensionsförening'' (Society for Retired Female Teachers) by [[Josefina Deland]] in 1855.&lt;ref&gt;Chief editor: Nils Bohman, Svenska män och kvinnor. 2, C-F (Swedish Men and Women. 2, C-F) dictionary (1944) (in Swedish)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1856, [[Fredrika Bremer]] published her famous ''[[Hertha (novel)|Hertha]]'', which aroused great controversy and created a debate referred to as the ''Hertha Debate''. The two foremost questions was to abolish [[coverture]] for unmarried women, and for the state to provide women an equivalent to a university. Both questions were met: in 1858, a reform granted unmarried women the right to apply for legal majority by a simple procedure, and in 1861, [[Högre lärarinneseminariet]] was founded as a "Women's University". In 1859, the first [[women's magazine]] in Sweden and the Nordic countries, the ''[[Tidskrift för hemmet]]'', was founded by [[Sophie Adlersparre]] and [[Rosalie Olivecrona]]. This has been referred to as the starting point of a women's movement in Sweden.

The organized women's movement begun in 1873, when [[Married Woman's Property Rights Association]] was co-founded by [[Anna Hierta-Retzius]] and [[Ellen Anckarsvärd]]. The prime task of the organization was to abolish [[coverture]]. In 1884, [[Fredrika Bremer Association]] was founded by [[Sophie Adlersparre]] to work for the improvement in women's rights. The second half of the 19th century saw the creation of several women's rights organisations and a considerable activity within both active organization as well as intellectual debate. The 1880s saw the so-called ''[[Sedlighetsdebatten]]'', were gender roles were discussed in literary debate in regards to sexual double standards in opposed to sexual equality. In 1902, finally, the [[National Association for Women's Suffrage (Sweden)|National Association for Women's Suffrage]] was founded.

In 1921, [[women's suffrage]] was finally introduced. The women suffrage reform was followed by the ''Behörighetslagen'' of 1923 (Act of Access of 1923), in which males and females were formally given equal access to all professions and positions in society, the only exceptions being military and priesthood positions.&lt;ref&gt;Lilla Focus Uppslagsbok (1979)&lt;/ref&gt; The last two restrictions were removed in 1958, when women were allowed to become priests, and in a series of reforms between 1980 and 1989, when all military professions were opened to women.&lt;ref&gt;Sundevall, Fia (2011).

The early feminist reformers were unorganized, and including prominent individuals who had suffered as victim of injustice. This included individuals such as [[Caroline Norton]] whose personal tragedy where she was unable to obtain a divorce and was denied access to her three sons by her husband, led her to a life of intense campaigning which successful led to the passing of the [[Custody of Infants Act 1839]] and the introduced the [[Tender years doctrine]] for child custody arrangement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wroath|first=John|title=Until They Are Seven, The Origins of Women's Legal Rights|year=1998|publisher=Waterside Press|isbn=1 872 870 57 0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mitchell|first=L.G.|title=Lord Melbourne, 1779–1848|year=1997|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Perkins|first=Jane Gray|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_FJBpAAAAMAAJ|title=The Life of the Honourable Mrs. Norton|year=1909|publisher=John Murray|isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Act gave married women, for the first time, a right to their children.

The first organized movement for English feminism was the [[Langham Place Circle]] of the 1850s, which included among others [[Barbara Bodichon]] (née Leigh-Smith) and [[Bessie Rayner Parkes]].&lt;ref name=LPC&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/public/themes/93/93708.html |title=Oxford DNB theme: Langham Place group |publisher=Oxforddnb.com |accessdate=2012-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group campaigned for many women's causes, including improved female rights in employment, and education. It also pursued women's property rights through its Married Women's Property Committee. In 1854, Bodichon published her ''Brief Summary of the Laws of England concerning Women'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://womhist.alexanderstreet.com/awrm/doc17.htm|title=Brief Summary of the Laws of England concerning Women|accessdate=6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was used by the [[National Association for the Promotion of Social Science|Social Science Association]] after it was formed in 1857 to push for the passage of the [[Married Women's Property Act 1882]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ben Griffin|title=The Politics of Gender in Victorian Britain: Masculinity, Political Culture and the Struggle for Women's Rights|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jsnnyrckKqQC&amp;pg=PA80|accessdate=23 June 2013|date=12 January 2012|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-107-01507-4|page=80}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1858, Barbara Bodichon, [[Matilda Hays|Matilda Mary Hays]] and Bessie Rayner Parkes established the first feminist British periodical, the ''[[English Woman's Journal]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{ODNBweb|id=57829|title=Hays, Matilda Mary|first=Lisa|last=Merrill}}&lt;/ref&gt; with Bessie Parkes the chief editor. The journal continued publication until 1864 and was succeeded in 1866 by the ''[[Englishwoman's Review]]'' edited until 1880 by [[Jessie Boucherett]] which continued publication until 1910. Jessie Boucherett and [[Adelaide Anne Proctor]] joined the Langham Place Circle in 1859. The group was active until 1866. Also in 1859, Jessie Boucherett, Barbara Bodichon and Adelaide Proctor formed the [[Society for Promoting the Employment of Women]] to promote the training and employment of women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Peter|last=Gordon|first2=David|last2=Doughan|title=Dictionary of British Women's Organisations, 1825–1960|year=2001|publisher=Woburn Press|location=London &amp; Portland, Or.|isbn=0-7130-0223-9|contribution=Society for Promoting the Employment of Women|pages=129–30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The society is one of the earliest British women's organisations, and continues to operate as the registered charity ''Futures for Women''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.futuresforwomen.org.uk/ Futures for Women] (accessed February 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Helen Blackburn]] and Boucherett established the Women's Employment Defence League in 1891, to defend women's working rights against restrictive employment legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Gerry Holloway|title=Women And Work in Britain Since 1840 |location=London |publisher=Routledge|year=2005|isbn=0415259118|page=98}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also together edited the ''Condition of Working Women and the Factory Acts'' in 1896. In the beginning of the 20th century, women's employment was still predominantly limited to factory labor and domestic work. During [[World War I]], more women found work outside the home. As a result of the wartime experience of women in the workforce, the ''[[Sex Disqualification (Removal) Act 1919]]'' opened professions and the civil service to women, and marriage was no longer a legal barrier to women working outside the home.

In 1918 [[Marie Stopes]] published the very influential ''[[Married Love]]'',&lt;ref name="google2004"&gt;{{cite book|last=Stopes |first=Marie Carmichael |editor-last=McKibbin |editor-first=Ross |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M13Q0aymFJoC|title=Married Love|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-280432-4|year=2004|orig-year=1918}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which she advocated [[gender equality]] in marriage and the importance of women's sexual desire. (Importation of the book into the United States was banned as obscene until 1931.)

The ''[[Representation of the People Act 1918]]'' extended the franchise to women who were at least 30 years old and they or their husbands were property holders, while the ''[[Parliament (Qualification of Women) Act 1918]]'' gave women the right to sit in Parliament, although it was only slowly that women were actually elected. In 1928, the franchise was extended to all women over 21 by the ''[[Representation of the People (Equal Franchise) Act 1928]]'', on an equal basis to men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Phillips, Melanie |title=The Ascent of Woman: A History of the Suffragette Movement and the Ideas Behind It |year=2004 |publisher=Abacus |location=London |isbn=978-0-349-11660-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Many feminist writers and women's rights activists argued that it was not equality to men which they needed but a recognition of what women need to fulfill their potential of their own natures, not only within the aspect of work but society and home life too. [[Virginia Woolf]] produced her essay ''[[A Room of One's Own]]'' based on the ideas of women as writers and characters in fiction. Woolf said that a woman must have money and a room of her own to be able to write.

''[[The Great Lawsuit|Woman in the Nineteenth Century]]'' by [[Margaret Fuller]] has been considered the first major feminist work in the United States and is often compared to Wollstonecraft's ''A Vindication of the Rights of Woman''.&lt;ref&gt;Slater, Abby. ''In Search of Margaret Fuller''. New York: Delacorte Press, 1978: 89–90. {{ISBN|0-440-03944-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prominent leaders of the feminist movement in the United States include [[Lucretia Coffin Mott]], [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]], [[Lucy Stone]], and [[Susan B. Anthony]]; Anthony and other activists such as [[Victoria Woodhull]] and [[Matilda Joslyn Gage]] made attempts to cast votes prior to their legal entitlement to do so, for which many of them faced charges. Other important leaders included several women who dissented against the law in order to have their voices heard, ([[Grimké sisters|Sarah and Angelina Grimké]]), in addition to other activists such as [[Carrie Chapman Catt]], [[Alice Paul]], [[Sojourner Truth]], [[Ida B. Wells]], [[Margaret Sanger]] and [[Lucy Burns]].&lt;ref&gt;Dicker, 2008. pp. 28, 47–48.&lt;/ref&gt;

First-wave feminism involved a wide range of women, some belonging to [[Christian right|conservative Christian]] groups (such as [[Frances Willard (suffragist)|Frances Willard]] and the [[Woman's Christian Temperance Union]]), others such as [[Matilda Joslyn Gage]] of the [[National Woman Suffrage Association]] (NWSA) resembling the radicalism of much of [[second-wave feminism]]. The majority of first-wave feminists were more moderate and conservative than radical or revolutionary—like the members of the [[American Woman Suffrage Association]] (AWSA) they were willing to work within the political system and they understood the clout of joining with sympathetic men in power to promote the cause of suffrage. The limited membership of the NWSA was narrowly focused on gaining a federal amendment for women's suffrage, whereas the AWSA, with ten times as many members, worked to gain suffrage on a state-by-state level as a necessary precursor to federal suffrage. The NWSA had broad goals, hoping to achieve a more equal social role for women, but the AWSA was aware of the divisive nature of many of those goals and instead chose to focus solely on suffrage. The NWSA was known for having more publicly aggressive tactics (such as picketing and hunger strikes) whereas the AWSA used more traditional strategies like lobbying, delivering speeches, applying political pressure and gathering signatures for petitions.&lt;ref&gt;Dicker, 2008, pp. 40–43.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the first wave, there was a notable connection between the slavery abolition movement and the women's rights movement. Frederick Douglass was heavily involved in both movements and believed that it was essential for both to work together in order to attain true equality in regards to race and sex.&lt;ref&gt;Rojas. U.S. Women of Color Feminism, 1st Edition. Kendall Hunt Publishing, Co., 01/2015. VitalSource Bookshelf Online.&lt;/ref&gt; Different accounts of the involvement of African-American women in the Women's Suffrage Movement are given. In a 1974 interview, [[Alice Paul]] notes that a compromise was made between southern groups to have white women march first, then men, then African-American women.&lt;ref name="test"&gt;[http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/awhhtml/aw01e/aw01e.html The Library of Congress], 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; In another account by the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP), difficulties in segregating women resulted in African-American women marching with their respective States without hindrance.&lt;ref&gt;The Library of Congress, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; Among them was Ida B. Wells-Barnett, who marched with the Illinois delegation.

The first wave of feminists, in contrast to the second wave, focused very little on the subjects of abortion, birth control, and overall reproductive rights of women. Though she never married, Anthony published her views about marriage, holding that a woman should be allowed to refuse sex with her husband; the American woman had no legal recourse at that time against [[Spousal rape|rape by her husband]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hasday|first=Jill Elaine|year=2000|title=Contest and Consent: A Legal History of Marital Rape|url=https://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?collection=journals&amp;handle=hein.journals/calr88&amp;id=1391&amp;men_tab=srchresults|journal=California Law Review|volume=88|issue=5|pages=1373–1505|jstor=3481263|doi=10.2307/3481263}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The end of the first wave is often linked with the passage of the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] (1920), granting women the right to vote. This was the major victory of the movement, which also included reforms in [[higher education]], in the workplace and professions, and in health care.
Women started serving on school boards and local bodies, and numbers kept increasing. This period also saw more women gaining access to higher education. In 1910, "women were attending many leading medical schools, and in 1915 the American Medical Association began to admit women members."&lt;ref name="autogenerated1995"&gt;[http://www.wic.org/misc/history.htm "Women's History in America"], Excerpted from Compton's Interactive Encyclopedia, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; A ''Matrimonial Causes Act 1923'' gave women the right to the same grounds for divorce as men.

The rise in unemployment during the [[Great Depression]] which started in the 1920s hit women first, and when the men also lost their jobs there was further strain on families. Many women served in the armed forces during [[World War II]], when around 300,000 American women served in the navy and army, performing jobs such as secretaries, typists and nurses.

=== State laws ===
1860, New York passed a revised [[Married Women's Property Acts in the United States|Married Women's Property Act]] which gave women shared ownership of their children, allowing them to have a say in their children's wills, wages, and granting them the right to inherit property.&lt;ref name="Dicker, 2008, pp. 30, 38"&gt;Dicker, 2008, pp. 30, 38.&lt;/ref&gt; Further advances and setbacks were experienced in New York and other states, but with each new win the feminists were able to use it as an example to apply more leverage on unyielding legislative bodies.

* Great Britain: The [[Sex Disqualification (Removal) Act 1919]] became law. In a broad opening statement it specified that, "[a] person shall not be disqualified by sex or marriage from the exercise of any public function, or from being appointed to or holding any civil or judicial office or post, or from entering or assuming or carrying on any civil profession or vocation". The Act did provide employment opportunities for individual women and many were appointed as magistrates, but in practice it fell far short of the expectations of the women's movement. Senior positions in the civil service were still closed to women and they could be excluded from juries if evidence was likely to be too "sensitive".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historyextra.com/feature/women-first |title=

== Criticism ==
First-wave feminism did not offer an intersectional perspective.

{{Campaignbox Conflict in Congo}}

The '''First Congo War''' (1996–1997) was a foreign invasion of [[Zaire]] led by [[Rwanda]] that replaced President [[Mobutu Sésé Seko]] with the rebel leader [[Laurent-Désiré Kabila]]. Destabilization in eastern Zaire resulting from the [[Rwandan genocide]] was the final factor that caused numerous internal and external factors to align against the corrupt and inept government in the capital, [[Kinshasa]].

The new government renamed the country [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], but it brought little true change. Kabila alienated his Rwandan and Ugandan allies. To avert a coup, Kabila expelled all Rwandan and Ugandan forces from the Congo. This event was a major cause of the [[Second Congo War]] the following year. Some experts prefer to view the two conflicts as one war.&lt;ref&gt;''e.g.'': Reyntjens, Filip. The Great African War: Congo and Regional Geopolitics, 1996–2006. Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 2009. p. 194&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

===Dying state in Zaire===
{{further|Zaire}}
An ethnic [[Ngbandi people|Ngbandi]], Mobutu came to power in 1965 and enjoyed support from the [[United States government]] because of his [[anti-communist]] stance while in office. However, Mobutu's authoritarian rule and policies allowed the Zairian state to decay, evidenced by a 65% decrease in Zairian [[GDP]] between independence in 1960 and the end of Mobutu's rule in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;Gondola, Ch. Didier. The History of Congo. Westport: Greenwood Press, 2002. p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; Following the end of the [[Cold War]] ''circa'' 1992, the United States stopped supporting Mobutu in favour of what it called a "[[new generation of African leaders]]",&lt;ref name="ken1"&gt;Kennes, Erik. "The Democratic Republic of the Congo: Structures of Greed, Networks of Need." Rethinking the Economics of War. Ed. Cynthia J. Arnson and I. William Zartman. Washington, D.C.: Woodrow Wilson Center, 2005. p. 147&lt;/ref&gt; including Rwanda's [[Paul Kagame]] and Uganda's [[Yoweri Museveni]].

A wave of [[democratisation]] swept across Africa during the 1990s.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} Under substantial internal and external pressure for a democratic transition in Zaire, Mobutu promised reform. He officially ended the [[one-party system]] he had maintained since 1967, but ultimately proved unwilling to implement broad reform, alienating allies both at home and abroad. In fact, the Zairian state had all but ceased to exist.&lt;ref name="Kennes, Erik 2005. p. 157"&gt;Kennes, Erik. "The Democratic Republic of the Congo: Structures of Greed, Networks of Need." Rethinking the Economics of War. Ed. Cynthia J. Arnson and I. William Zartman. Washington, D.C.: Woodrow Wilson Center, 2005. p. 157&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of the Zairian population relied on an [[informal sector|informal economy]] for their subsistence, since the official economy was not reliable.&lt;ref name="Kennes, Erik 2005. p. 157"/&gt; Furthermore, the Zairian national army, ''Forces Armées Zaïroises'' (FAZ), was forced to prey upon the population for survival; Mobutu himself allegedly once asked FAZ soldiers why they needed pay when they had weapons.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web |url= http://www.irinnews.org/Report.aspx?ReportId=61006 |title= Congo's Curse |agency= IRIN |date= 5 October 2010 |access-date= 2015-10-15 |quote= Ex-president Mobutu once asked his soldiers why they needed salaries when they had guns [...] |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100827170948/http://www.irinnews.org/Report.aspx?ReportId=61006 |archivedate= 27 August 2010 |df= dmy-all }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Mobutu's rule encountered considerable internal resistance, and given the weak central state, rebel groups could find refuge in Zaire's eastern provinces, far from the capital, [[Kinshasa]]. Opposition groups included leftists who had supported [[Patrice Lumumba]] (1925–1961), as well as ethnic and regional minorities opposed to the dominance of Kinshasa. [[Laurent-Désiré Kabila]], an ethnic [[Luba people|Luba]] from [[Katanga (province)|Katanga]] province who would eventually overthrow Mobutu, had fought Mobutu's régime since its inception.&lt;ref&gt;
Gribbin, Robert E. In the Aftermath of Genocide: the U.S. Role in Rwanda. New York: IUniverse, 2005. p. 190
&lt;/ref&gt;
The inability of the Mobutuist régime to control rebel movements in its eastern provinces eventually allowed its internal and external foes to ally.

===Ethnic tensions===
Tensions had existed between various ethnic groups in eastern Zaire for centuries, especially between the [[agrarian society|agrarian]] tribes native to Zaire and semi-[[nomad]]ic [[Tutsi]] tribes that had emigrated from [[Rwanda]] at various times.&lt;ref&gt;Vlassenroot, Koen. "Conflict &amp; Malitia Formation in Eastern Congo." Ed. Preben Kaarsholm. Violence, Political Culture &amp; Development in Africa. Athens: Ohio UP, 2006. 49–65. p. 53&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest of these migrants arrived before [[colonisation]] in the 1880s, followed by emigrants whom the [[Belgian Congo|Belgian]] [[colonization of Africa|colonizers]] forcibly relocated to Congo to perform manual labour (after 1908), and by another significant wave of emigrants fleeing the social revolution of 1959 that brought the [[Hutu]] to power in [[Kigali]].&lt;ref name="Lemarchand, René 2009. p. 32"&gt;Lemarchand, René. The Dynamics of Violence in Central Africa. Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania, 2009. p. 32&lt;/ref&gt;

Tutsi who emigrated to Zaire before Congolese independence in 1960 are known as [[Banyamulenge]], meaning "from [[Mulenge]]", and had the right to citizenship under Zairian law.&lt;ref name="banya"&gt;Vlassenroot, Koen. "Citizenship, Identity Formation &amp; Conflict in South Kivu: The Case of the Banyamulenge". ''Review of African Political Economy''. 2002. 499–515.&lt;/ref&gt; Tutsi who emigrated to Zaire following independence are known as [[Banyarwanda]], although the native locals often do not distinguish between the two, call them both Banyamulenge and consider them foreigners.&lt;ref name="Lemarchand, René 2009. p. 32"/&gt;

After coming to power in 1965, Mobutu gave the Banyamulenge political power in the east in hopes that they, as a minority, would keep a tight grip on power and prevent more populous ethnicities from forming an opposition.&lt;ref name="Autesserre, Severine 2008"&gt;Autesserre, Severine. "The Trouble With Congo: How Local Disputes Fuel Regional Conflict." Foreign Affairs. 2008. 87(3). 94–110.&lt;/ref&gt; This move aggravated the existing ethnic tensions by strengthening the Banyamulenge's hold over important stretches of land in [[North Kivu]] that indigenous people claimed as their own.&lt;ref name="Autesserre, Severine 2008"/&gt;  From 1963 to 1966 the [[Hunde]] and [[Nande language|Nande]] ethnic groups of [[North Kivu]] fought against Rwandan emigrants&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Despite a strong Rwandan presence in Mobutu's government, in 1981, Zaire adopted a restrictive citizenship law  which denied the Banyamulenge and Banyarwanda citizenship and therewith all political rights.&lt;ref&gt;Lemarchand, René. The Dynamics of Violence in Central Africa. Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania, 2009. pp. 15–16&lt;/ref&gt; Though never enforced, the law greatly angered individuals of Rwandan descent and contributed to a rising sense of ethnic hatred.&lt;ref name="Autesserre, Severine 2008"/&gt; From 1993 to 1996 Hunde, Nande, and [[Nyanga language|Nyanga]] youth regularly attacked the Banyamulenge, leading to a total of 14,000 deaths.&lt;ref&gt;Lemarchand, René.

Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania, 2009. pp. 13–14&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995 the Zairian Parliament ordered all peoples of Rwandan or Burundian descent repatriated to their countries of origin, including the Banyamulenge.&lt;ref&gt;Lemarchand, René. The Dynamics of Violence in Central Africa. Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania, 2009. p.16&lt;/ref&gt; Due to political exclusion and ethnic violence, as early as 1991 the Banyamulenge developed ties to the [[Rwandan Patriotic Front]] (RPF), a mainly Tutsi rebel movement based in Uganda but with aspirations to power in Rwanda.&lt;ref&gt;Vlassenroot, Koen.

===Rwandan genocide===
[[File:Rwandan refugee camp in east Zaire.jpg|thumb|250px|A Rwandan refugee camp in Zaire, 1994.]]
{{Main|Rwandan Civil War|Rwandan Genocide}}
The deciding event in precipitating the war was the genocide in neighbouring [[Rwanda]] in 1994, which sparked a mass exodus of refugees known as the [[Great Lakes refugee crisis]]. During the 100-day genocide, hundreds of thousands of [[Tutsi]]s and sympathizers were massacred at the hands of predominantly Hutu aggressors. The genocide ended when the Hutu government in Kigali was overthrown by the Tutsi-dominated [[Rwandan Patriotic Front]] (RPF).

Of those who fled Rwanda during the crisis, about 1.5 million settled in eastern Zaire.&lt;ref&gt;Reyntjens, Filip. The Great African War: Congo and Regional Geopolitics, 1996–2006. Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 2009. p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; These refugees included Tutsi who fled the Hutu ''[[Genocidaires|génocidaires]]'' as well as one million&lt;ref name="Autesserre, Severine 2008"/&gt; Hutus that fled the Tutsi RPF's subsequent retaliation. Prominent among the latter group were the ''génocidaires'' themselves, such as elements of the former Rwandan Army, ''{{ILL|Forces armées rwandaises|fr}}'' (FAR), and independent Hutu extremist groups known as ''[[Interahamwe]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.isn.ethz.ch/news/sw/details.cfm?id=18434 |title=North Kivu: How to end a war |publisher=ISN Security Watch}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often, these Hutu forces allied themselves with local [[Mai Mai]] militias, who granted them access to mines and weapons. Though these were initially self-defense organizations, they quickly became aggressors.&lt;ref name="Autesserre, Severine 2008"/&gt;

The Hutu set up camps in eastern Zaire from which they attacked both the newly arrived Rwandan Tutsi as well as the [[Banyamulenge]] and [[Banyarwanda]]. These attacks caused about one hundred deaths a month during the first half of 1996.&lt;ref&gt;Gribbin, Robert E. In the Aftermath of Genocide: the U.S. Role in Rwanda. New York: IUniverse, 2005. p. 143&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the newly arrived militants were intent on returning to power in Rwanda and began launching attacks against the new regime in Kigali, which represented a serious security threat to the infant state.&lt;ref&gt;Reyntjens, Filip. The Great African War: Congo and Regional Geopolitics, 1996–2006. Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 2009. p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; Not only was the Mobutu government incapable of controlling the former ''génocidaires'' for previously mentioned reasons but actually supported them in training and supplying for an invasion of Rwanda,&lt;ref&gt;Reyntjens, Filip. The Great African War: Congo and Regional Geopolitics, 1996–2006. Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 2009. p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; forcing Kigali to act.

==Banyamulenge rebellion==
Given the exacerbated [[ethnic hatred|ethnic tensions]] and the lack of government control in the past, Rwanda took action against the security threat posed by ''[[génocidaire]]s'' who had found refuge in eastern Zaire. The government in [[Kigali]] began forming [[Tutsi]] [[militia]]s for operations in Zaire as early as 1995&lt;ref name="reyn48"&gt;Reyntjens, Filip. The Great African War: Congo and Regional Geopolitics, 1996–2006. Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 2009. p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; and chose to act following an exchange of fire between Rwandan Tutsi and Zairian Green Berets that marked the outbreak of the [[Banyamulenge]] Rebellion on 31 August 1996.&lt;ref&gt;Reyntjens, Filip. The Great African War: Congo and Regional Geopolitics, 1996–2006. Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 2009. p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;

While there was general unrest in eastern Zaire, the rebellion was probably not a grassroots movement; Uganda president [[Yoweri Museveni]], who supported and worked closely with Rwanda in the First Congo War, later recalled that the rebellion was incited by Zairian Tutsi who had been recruited by the [[Rwandan Patriotic Army]] (RPA).&lt;ref name="reyn48"/&gt; The initial goal of the Banyamulenge Rebellion was to seize power in Zaire's eastern Kivu provinces and combat the extremist Hutu forces attempting to continue the genocide in their new home. However, the rebellion did not remain Tutsi-dominated for long. Mobutu's harsh and selfish rule created enemies in virtually all sectors of Zairian society. As a result, the new rebellion benefited from massive public support and grew to be a general revolution rather than a mere Banyamulenge uprising.&lt;ref&gt;Afoaku, Osita. "Congo's Rebels: Their Origins, Motivations, and Strategies." Ed. John F. Clark. The Africa Stakes of the Congo War. New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2002. 109-28. p. 121&lt;/ref&gt;

Banyamulenge elements and non-Tutsi militias coalesced into the [[Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo]] (AFDL) under the leadership of [[Laurent-Désiré Kabila]], who had been a long-time opponent of the Mobutu government and was a leader of one of the three main rebel groups that founded the AFDL. While the AFDL was an ostensibly Zairian rebel movement, Rwanda had played a key role in its formation. Observers of the war, as well as the Rwandan Defense Minister and Vice-President at the time, [[Paul Kagame]], claim that the AFDL was formed in and directed from Kigali and contained not only Rwandan-trained troops but also regulars of the [[Rwandan Patriotic Army|RPA]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Pomfret, John. "Rwandans Led Revolt in Congo; Defense Minister Says Arms, Troops Supplied for Anti-Mobutu Drive." Washington Post. 9 July 1997: A1.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Foreign involvement==
[[File:Zaire 96map.png|thumb|Map of Zaire in {{circa}}1996]]

===Rwanda===
According to expert observers, as well as Kagame himself, Rwanda played the largest role of a foreign actor, if not the largest role of all, in the First Congo War. Kigali was instrumental in the formation of the AFDL and sent its own troops to fight alongside the rebels. While its actions were originally sparked by the security threat posed by the Zairian-based ''génocidaires,'' Kigali was pursuing multiple goals during its invasion of Zaire.

The first and foremost of these was the suppression of ''génocidaires'' who had been launching attacks against the new Rwandan state from Zaire. Kagame claimed that Rwandan agents had discovered the plans to invade Rwanda with support from Mobutu; in response, Kigali began its intervention with the intention of dismantling the refugee camps in which the ''génocidaires'' often took refuge and destroying the structure of these anti-Rwandan elements.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

A second goal cited by Kagame, was the overthrow of Mobutu. While partially a means to minimize the threat in eastern Zaire, the new Rwandan state also sought to set up a puppet regime in Kinshasa.&lt;ref name="ken1"/&gt; This goal was not particularly threatening to other states in the region because it was ostensibly a means to securing Rwandan security and because many of them also opposed Mobutu. Kigali was further aided by the tacit support of the United States, which supported Kagame as a member of the new generation of African leaders.&lt;ref name="ken1"/&gt;

However, the true intentions of Rwanda are not entirely clear. Some authors have proposed that dismantling refugee camps was a means of replenishing Rwanda's depleted population and workforce following the genocide; because the destruction of the camps was followed by forced repatriation of Tutsi regardless of whether they were Rwandan or Zairian.&lt;ref&gt;Gribbin, Robert E. In the Aftermath of Genocide: the U.S. Role in Rwanda. New York: IUniverse, 2005. p. 107, 201&lt;/ref&gt; The intervention may also have been motivated by revenge; the Rwandan forces, as well as the AFDL, massacred retreating Hutu refugees in several known instances.&lt;ref name="atro"&gt;Gribbin, Robert E. In the Aftermath of Genocide: the U.S. Role in Rwanda. New York: IUniverse, 2005. p. 213-14&lt;/ref&gt; A commonly cited factor for Rwandan actions is that the RPF, which had recently come to power in Kigali, had come to see itself as the protector of the Tutsi nation and was therefore partially acting in defense of its Zairian brethren.&lt;ref&gt;Longman, Timothy. "The Complex Reasons for Rwanda's Engagement in Congo." Ed. John F. Clark. The African Stakes of the Congo War. New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2002. 129-44. p. 131&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Autesserre, Severine 2008"/&gt;

Rwanda possibly also harbored ambitions to annex portions of eastern Zaire. [[Pasteur Bizimungu]], president of Rwanda from 1994–2000, presented the then-US ambassador to Rwanda, Robert Gribbin, with the idea of a "Greater Rwanda." This idea purports that the ancient state of Rwanda included parts of eastern Zaire that should actually belong to Rwanda.&lt;ref&gt;Gribbin, Robert E. In the Aftermath of Genocide: the U.S. Role in Rwanda. New York: IUniverse, 2005. p. 175-76&lt;/ref&gt; However, it appears that Rwanda never seriously attempted to annex these territories. The history of conflict in the Congo is often associated with illegal resource exploitation but, although Rwanda did benefit financially by plundering Zaire's wealth,&lt;ref&gt;Reyntjens, Filip. The Great African War: Congo and Regional Geopolitics, 1996–2006. Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 2009. p. 147-48&lt;/ref&gt; this is not usually considered their initial motivation for Rwandan intervention in the First Congo War.&lt;ref name="Samset, Ingrid 2002. pp. 470"&gt;Samset, Ingrid. ‘Conflict of Interests or Interests in Conflict? Diamonds &amp; War in the DRC.’ Review of African Political Economy. 2002. 463–480. pp. 470–471&lt;/ref&gt;

===Uganda===
As a close ally of the RPF, [[Uganda]] also played a major role in the First Congo War. Prominent members of the RPF had fought alongside [[Yoweri Museveni]] in the [[Ugandan Bush War]] that brought him to power, and Museveni allowed the RPF to use Uganda as a base during the 1990 offensive into Rwanda and [[Rwandan Civil War|subsequent civil war]]. Given their historical ties, the Rwandan and Ugandan governments were closely allied and Museveni worked closely with Kagame throughout the First Congo War. Ugandan soldiers were present in Zaire throughout the conflict and Museveni likely helped Kagame plan and direct the AFDL.&lt;ref name="reyn48"/&gt;

Lt. Col. [[James Kabarebe]] of the AFDL, for example, was a former member of Uganda's [[National Resistance Army]], the military wing of the rebel movement that brought Museveni to power, and [[Directorate-General for External Security|French]] and [[Belgian State Security Service|Belgian intelligence]] reported that 15,000 Ugandan-trained Tutsi fought for the AFDL.&lt;ref&gt;Reyntjens, Filip. The Great African War: Congo and Regional Geopolitics, 1996–2006. Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 2009. p. 54, 58&lt;/ref&gt; However, Uganda did not support Rwanda in all aspects of the war. Museveni was reportedly much less inclined to overthrow Mobutu, preferring to keep the rebellion in the East where the former ''génocidaires'' were operating.&lt;ref&gt;Reyntjens, Filip. The Great African War: Congo and Regional Geopolitics, 1996–2006. Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 2009. p. 59&lt;/ref&gt;

===Angola===
Angola remained on the sidelines until 1997, but its entrance into the fray greatly increased the already superior strength of anti-Mobutu forces. The Angolan government chose to act primarily through [[Katanga Province|Katangese]] ''[[gendarmerie|gendarme]]s'' called the ''Tigres'', proxy groups formed from the remnants of police units exiled from Zaire, fighting to return to their homeland.&lt;ref&gt;Gribbin, Robert E. In the Aftermath of Genocide: the U.S. Role in Rwanda. New York: IUniverse, 2005. p. 218&lt;/ref&gt; Luanda did also deploy regular troops. Angola chose to participate in the First Congo War because members of Mobutu's government were directly involved in supplying the Angolan rebel group, [[UNITA]].&lt;ref&gt;Reyntjens, Filip. The Great African War: Congo and Regional Geopolitics, 1996–2006. Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 2009. p. 62&lt;/ref&gt;

It is unclear exactly how the government benefited from this relationship, other than personal enrichment for several officials, but it is certainly possible that Mobutu was unable to control the actions of some members of his government. Regardless of the reasoning in Kinshasa, Angola entered the war on the side of the rebels and was determined to overthrow the Mobutu government, which it saw as the only way to address the threat posed by the Zairian-UNITA relationship.

===UNITA===
Due to its ties to the Mobutu government, [[UNITA]] also participated in the First Congo War. The greatest impact that it had on the war was probably that it gave Angola reason to join the anti-Mobutu coalition. However, UNITA forces fought alongside FAZ forces in at least several instances.&lt;ref&gt;Reyntjens, Filip. The Great African War: Congo and Regional Geopolitics, 1996–2006. Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 2009. p. 63&lt;/ref&gt; Among other examples, Kagame claimed that his forces fought a pitched battle against UNITA near Kinshasa towards the end of the war.&lt;ref&gt;Pomfret, John. "Rwandans Led Revolt in Congo; Defense Minister Says Arms, Troops Supplied for Anti-Mobutu Drive." Washington Post. 9 July 1997: A1&lt;/ref&gt;

===Others===
Numerous other external actors played lesser roles in the First Congo War. [[Burundi]], which had recently come under the rule of a pro-Tutsi leader, supported Rwandan and Ugandan involvement in Zaire but provided very limited military support.&lt;ref&gt;Reyntjens, Filip. The Great African War: Congo and Regional Geopolitics, 1996–2006. Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 2009. p. 42, 61&lt;/ref&gt; [[Zambia]] and [[Zimbabwe]] also gave measured amounts of military support to the rebel movement.&lt;ref&gt;Reyntjens, Filip. The Great African War: Congo and Regional Geopolitics, 1996–2006. Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 2009. p. 65-66&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eritrea]], an ally of Rwanda under Kagame, sent an entire battalion of [[Eritrean Army|its army]] to support the invasion of Zaire.{{sfnp|Plaut|2016|pp=54–55}} Likewise, [[Ethiopia]], and the [[South Sudan]]ese rebel army, the [[Sudan People's Liberation Army|SPLA]], all provided financial or moral support to the anti-Mobutu coalition. Other than from UNITA, Mobutu also received some aid from [[Sudan]], whom Mobutu had long supported against the SPLA, though the exact amount of aid is unclear and ultimately was unable to hinder the advance of opposing forces.&lt;ref&gt;Reyntjens, Filip. The Great African War: Congo and Regional Geopolitics, 1996–2006. Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 2009. p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; Zaire also employed foreign [[mercenary|mercenaries]] from several African and European countries.

==1996==
With active support from Rwanda, Uganda,&lt;ref name="reyn"&gt;Reyntjens, Filip. The Great African War: Congo and Regional Geopolitics, 1996–2006. Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 2009. p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; and Eritrea,{{sfnp|Plaut|2016|pp=54–55}} Kabila's AFDL was able to capture 800 x 100&amp;nbsp;km{{clarify|date=January 2018}} of territory along the border with Rwanda, Uganda, and Burundi by 25 December 1996.&lt;ref name="reyn"/&gt; This occupation temporarily satisfied the rebels, because it gave them power in the east and allowed them to defend themselves against the former ''génocidaires''. Likewise, the external actors had successfully crippled the ability of the same ''génocidaires'' to use Zaire as a base for attacks. There was a pause in the rebel advance following the acquisition of this buffer territory that lasted until Angola entered the war in February 1997.&lt;ref&gt;Reyntjens, Filip. The Great African War: Congo and Regional Geopolitics, 1996–2006. Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 2009. pp. 61–63&lt;/ref&gt;

During this time, Rwanda destroyed refugee camps the ''génocidaires'' had been using as safe-bases, and forcibly repatriated Tutsi to Rwanda. It also captured many lucrative diamond and [[coltan]] mines, which it later resisted relinquishing.&lt;ref name="Autesserre, Severine 2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Samset, Ingrid 2002. pp. 470"/&gt; Rwandan and aligned forces committed multiple atrocities, mainly against Hutu refugees.&lt;ref name="atro"/&gt; The true extent of the abuses is unknown because the AFDL and RPF carefully managed NGO and press access to areas where atrocities were thought to have occurred.&lt;ref&gt;Reyntjens, Filip. The Great African War: Congo and Regional Geopolitics, 1996–2006. Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 2009. p. 100&lt;/ref&gt; However [[Amnesty International]] said as many as 200,000 Rwandese Hutu refugees were massacred by them and the [[Rwandan Defence Forces]] and aligned forces.&lt;ref name=amnesty1998&gt;[https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/afr62/033/1998/en/ Democratic Republic of Congo. An long-standing crisis spinning out of control] . Amnesty International, 3 September 1998. p. 9. AI Index: AFR 62/33/98&lt;/ref&gt; The United Nations similarly documented mass killings of civilians by Rwandan, Ugandan and the [[Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo|AFDL]] soldiers in the [[DRC Mapping Exercise Report]].

==1997==
[[File:Laurent-Désiré Kabila cropped.jpg|thumb|Statue of [[Laurent-Désiré Kabila]]]]

There are two explanations for the restart of the rebel advance in 1997. The first, and most probable, is that Angola had joined the anti-Mobutu coalition, giving it numbers and strength far superior to the FAZ, and demanding that Mobutu be removed from power. Kagame presents another, possibly secondary, reason for the march on Kinshasa: that the employment of [[Serbia]]n mercenaries in the battle for [[Walikale]] proved that "Mobutu intended to wage real war against Rwanda."&lt;ref&gt;Gribbin, Robert E. In the Aftermath of Genocide: the U.S. Role in Rwanda. New York: IUniverse, 2005. p. 213&lt;/ref&gt; According to this logic, Rwanda's initial concerns had been to manage the security threat in eastern Zaire but it was now forced to dispose of the hostile government in Kinshasa.

Whatever the case, once the advance resumed in 1997, there was virtually no meaningful resistance from what was left of Mobutu's army. Kabila's forces were only held back by the dreadful state of Zaire's [[infrastructure]]. In some areas, no real roads existed; the only means of transport were infrequently used dirt paths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The World Today Series: Africa 2012|last=Dickovick |first=J. Tyler |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2008 |publisher=Stryker-Post Publications |location=Lanham, Maryland |isbn=978-1-61048-881-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The AFDL committed grave human rights violations, such as the carnage at a refugee camp of Hutus at Tingi-Tingi near [[Kisangani]], where tens of thousands of refugees were massacred.&lt;ref name=dvr&gt;{{cite book| author=[[David van Reybrouck]]| title=[[Congo: The Epic History of a People]]| publisher=[[HarperCollins]], 2012 |page=423ff |isbn=978-0-06-220011-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coming from the east, the AFDL advanced westward in two pincer movements. The northern one took [[Kisangani]], [[Boende]], and [[Mbandaka]], while the southern one took [[Bakwanga]], and [[Kikwit]].&lt;ref name=dvr/&gt; Around this time, [[Sudan]] attempted to coordinate with remnants of the FAZ and [[White Legion (Zaire)|White Legion]] that were retreating northward to escape the AFDL. This was to prevent Zaire from becoming a safe haven for the [[Sudan People's Liberation Army]] (SPLA) and its allies, which were fighting the Sudanese government in the [[Second Sudanese Civil War]] at the time. The Mobutu-loyal forces were collapsing so quickly, however, that they could not prevent the AFDL, SPLA and Ugandan military from occupying northeastern Zaire. Sudan-allied Ugandan insurgent groups which had been based in the region were forced to retreat into southern Sudan alongside FAZ troops that had not yet surrendered and a smaller number of [[Sudanese Armed Forces]] (SAF) soldiers. They attempted to reach the SAF base at [[Yei, South Sudan|Yei]], not knowing that it had already been overrun by the SPLA. The column of about 4,000 fighters and their families was ambushed by the SPLA on 12 March, and mostly destroyed; 2,000 were killed, and over 1,000 captured. The survivors fled to [[Juba]].{{sfnp|Prunier|2004|pp=376–377}} Meanwhile, the AFDL reached [[Kinshasa]] by the middle of May. Another AFDL group captured [[Lubumbashi]] on April 19 and moved on by air to Kinshasa. Mobutu fled Kinshasa on May 16, and the "libérateurs" entered the capital without serious resistance.&lt;ref name=dvr/&gt; The AFDL-allied Eritrean battalion had aided the rebels during the entire 1,500 km advance despite being not well equipped for the environment and lacking almost all logistical support. By the time the Eritreans arrived at Kinshasa along the AFDL, they were exhausted, starving and ill, having suffered heavy causalities as result. They had to be evacuated from the country by the war's end.{{sfnp|Plaut|2016|p=55}} 

Throughout the rebel advance, there were attempts by the international community to negotiate a settlement. However, the AFDL did not take these negotiations seriously but instead partook so as to avoid international criticism for being unwilling to attempt a diplomatic solution while actually continuing its steady advance.&lt;ref&gt;Reyntjens, Filip. The Great African War: Congo and Regional Geopolitics, 1996–2006. Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 2009. p. 130&lt;/ref&gt; The FAZ, which had been weak all along, was unable to mount any serious resistance to the strong AFDL and its foreign sponsors.

Mobutu fled first to his palace at [[Gbadolite]] and then to [[Rabat]], [[Morocco]], where he died on 7 September 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/09/08/world/mobutu-sese-seko-zairian-ruler-is-dead-in-exile-in-morocco-at-66.html |title=Mobutu Sese Seko, Zairian Ruler, Is Dead in Exile in Morocco at 66 |author=Howard W.

He then attempted to reorganise the nation as the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] (DRC).

==Aftermath==
{{refimprove|section|date=May 2018}}&lt;!--2 paragraphs with no citations--&gt;
{{main|Second Congo War}}
The new Congolese state under Kabila's rule proved to be disappointingly similar to Zaire under Mobutu. The economy remained in a state of severe disrepair and deteriorated further under Kabila's corrupt rule.&lt;ref&gt;Kennes, Erik. "The Democratic Republic of the Congo: Structures of Greed, Networks of Need." Rethinking the Economics of War. Ed. Cynthia J. Arnson and I. William Zartman. Washington, D.C.: Woodrow Wilson Center, 2005. p. 154&lt;/ref&gt; He failed to improve the government, which continued to be weak and corrupt. Instead, Kabila began a vigorous centralisation campaign, bringing renewed conflict with minority groups in the east who demanded autonomy.

Kabila also came to be seen as an instrument of the foreign regimes that put him in power. To counter this image and increase domestic support, he began to turn against his allies abroad. This culminated in the expulsion of all foreign forces from the DRC on 26 July 1998. The states with armed forces still in the DRC begrudgingly complied although some of them saw this as undermining their interests, particularly Rwanda, which had hoped to install a proxy-regime in Kinshasa.

Several factors that led to the First Congo War remained in place after Kabila's accession to power. Prominent among these were ethnic tensions in eastern DRC, where the government still had little control. There the historical animosities remained and the opinion that Banyamulenge, as well as all Tutsi, were foreigners was reinforced by the foreign occupation in their defence.&lt;ref&gt;Longman, Timothy. "The Complex Reasons for Rwanda's Engagement in Congo." Ed. John F. Clark. The African Stakes of the Congo War. New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2002. 129-44. pp. 131–32&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Rwanda had not been able to satisfactorily address its security concerns. By forcibly repatriating refugees, Rwanda had imported the conflict.&lt;ref&gt;Vlassenroot, Koen. "Citizenship, Identity Formation &amp; Conflict in South Kivu: The Case of the Banyamulenge." Review of African Political Economy. 2002. 499–515. p. 173&lt;/ref&gt;

This manifested itself in the form of a predominantly Hutu insurgency in Rwanda's western provinces that was supported by extremist elements in eastern DRC. Without troops in the DRC, Rwanda was unable to successfully combat the insurgents. In the first days of August 1998, two brigades of the new Congolese army rebelled against the government and formed rebel groups that worked closely with Kigali and Kampala. This marked the beginning of the [[Second Congo War]].

''' Francisco Antonio de Fuentes y Guzmán ''' (1643–1700) was a [[Guatemala]]n ''[[criollo people|criollo]]'' historian and poet. His only surviving work is the ''[[Recordación Florida]]''.

==Biography==
Fuentes y Guzmán was born to a wealthy family in [[Santiago de los Caballeros de Guatemala]] (modern [[Antigua Guatemala]]) in 1643.&lt;ref name="Warren73p05"/&gt; He was the great-great-grandson of the [[conquistador]] [[Bernal Díaz del Castillo]],&lt;ref name="Warren73p05"&gt;Warren 1973, p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt; historian of the Indies. Fuentes y Guzmán was a nobleman and a member of the ruling ''criollo'' [[casta|caste]].&lt;ref&gt;Luján Muñoz 1990, p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1661, at the age of eighteen, Fuentes y Guzmán was given the position of [[Regidor]] Perpetuo de Guatemala (permanent councillor on the town council of Santiago).&lt;ref name="Warren73p05"/&gt; At various times he served as magistrate (''[[alcalde]]'') in Santiago, and was later the ''alcalde mayor'' of [[Totonicapán]], and then of [[Sonsonate, El Salvador|Sonsonate]].&lt;ref name="Warren73p05"/&gt; He worked many years as the ''Cronista del Ayuntamiento'' (Chronicler of the Municipal Government). He is thought to have died in Sonsonate in 1700.&lt;ref name="Warren73p05"/&gt;

===''Recordación Florida''===
The ''Recordación Florida'', also called ''Historia de Guatemala'' (''History of Guatemala''), is Fuentes y Guzmán's only surviving work. It was the first Guatemalan history book written by a colonial Guatemalan author of Spanish descent.&lt;ref name="LaraFigueroa00p1"&gt;Lara Figueroa 2000, p.1.&lt;/ref&gt; The first portion of the work, comprising the first sixteen books, was written by 1690.&lt;ref name="Warren73p05"/&gt; Fuentes y Guzmán sent it to Spain in apparently the vain hope of being named as Chronicler of the [[Captaincy General of Guatemala|Kingdom of Guatemala]].&lt;ref name="Warren73p05"/&gt; He continued writing the work, with the addition of a seventeenth book to the first part, and a second part comprising 14 more books.&lt;ref name="Warren73p05"/&gt; The ''Recordación Florida'' regarded as one of the most important works of Guatemalan history.&lt;ref name="LaraFigueroa00p1"/&gt; In the book, he describes the customs and rites of indigenous people, the [[Spanish conquest of Guatemala]], and notable facts in the history of Guatemala until the 17th century.

The [[:wikisource:es:Recordación Florida|incomplete first part]] of the ''Recordación Florida'' was published in Madrid in 1882-1883.&lt;ref name="Warren73p05"/&gt; The complete text was stored in the archive of the Municipality of Guatemala, and was published in Guatemala in 1932-1933.&lt;ref name="Warren73p05"/&gt; Large portions of the work were reproduced in the writing of diocesan priest [[Domingo de Juarros]], published in the early 19th century.&lt;ref name="Warren73p05"/&gt;

==Other works==
*''[[El Milagro de América]]'', describing the inauguration of the Catedral de Guatemala
*''La Vida de Santa Teresa de Jesús'', describing the festivities in Guatemala when King [[Carlos II of Spain]] turned 13
*''La Cinosura Política o Ceremonial de Guatemala''.
*''El Norte Político''.

'''Heather Irene McKillop''' is a Canadian-American [[archaeologist]], academic, and [[Maya peoples|Maya]] scholar, noted in particular for her research into ancient [[Maya civilization|Maya]] coastal trade routes, seafaring, littoral archaeology, and the long-distance exchange of commodities in [[pre-Columbian]] [[Mesoamerica]]. Since the 2004 discovery of ancient Maya wooden architecture and a wooden canoe paddle preserved in a peat bog below the sea floor, McKillop and her team of LSU students and colleagues have been focused on the discovery, mapping, excavation, sediment coring and analyses of the waterlogged remains. She started the DIVA Lab (Digital Imaging and Visualization in Archaeology) in 2008 to make 3D digital images of the waterlogged wood, pottery, and other artifacts from the underwater Maya sites--Paynes Creek Salt Works. {{As of|2016}} McKillop is Thomas and Lillian Landrum Alumni Professor in the Department of Geography and Anthropology at Louisiana State University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tamupress.com/product/In-Search-of-Maya-Sea-Traders,202.aspx |title=In Search of Maya Sea Traders |publisher=[[Texas A&amp;M University]] |accessdate=October 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Italic title}}[[File:The Su Wen of the Huangdi Neijing.djvu|thumb|page=3|[[:File:The Su Wen of the Huangdi Neijing.djvu]]|A digitized copy of the ''Su Wen of the Huangdi Neijing'' for online reading]]
'''''Huangdi Neijing''''' ({{zh|s=黄帝内经|t=黃帝內經|p=Huángdì Nèijīng}}), literally the '''''Inner Canon of the Yellow Emperor''''' or '''''Esoteric Scripture of the Yellow Emperor''''', is an [[ancient China|ancient Chinese]] medical text that has been treated as the fundamental doctrinal source for [[Chinese medicine]] for more than two [[millennia]]. The work is composed of two texts—each of eighty-one chapters or treatises in a question-and-answer format between the mythical [[Yellow Emperor]] and six of his equally legendary ministers.

The first text, the ''Suwen'' (素問), also known as ''Basic Questions'',&lt;ref name=wdl/&gt; covers the theoretical foundation of Chinese Medicine and its diagnostic methods.  The second and generally less referred-to text, the ''[[Lingshu]]'' (靈樞; ''Spiritual Pivot''), discusses [[acupuncture]] therapy in great detail.  Collectively, these two texts are known as the ''Neijing'' or ''Huangdi Neijing.''  In practice, however, the title ''Neijing'' often refers only to the more influential ''Suwen''.

Two other texts also carried the prefix ''Huangdi Neijing'' in their titles: the ''Mingtang'' (明堂; ''Hall of Light'') and the ''[[Taisu]]'' (太素; ''Grand Basis''), both of which have survived only partially.

==Overview==
The earliest mention of the ''Huangdi Neijing'' was in the bibliographical chapter of the ''[[Book of Han|Hanshu]]'' 漢書 (or ''Book of Han'', completed in 111 CE), next to a ''Huangdi Waijing'' 黃帝外經 (“Outer Canon of the Yellow Emperor”) that is now lost. A scholar-physician called [[Huangfu Mi]] 皇甫謐 (215-282 CE) was the first to claim that the ''Huangdi Neijing'' in 18 juan 卷 (or volumes) that was listed in the ''Hanshu'' bibliography corresponded with two different books that circulated in his own time: the ''Suwen'' and the ''Zhenjing'' 鍼經 (“Needling Canon”), each in 9 juan.&lt;ref&gt;Sivin 1993, 197.&lt;/ref&gt; Since scholars believe that ''Zhenjing'' was one of the ''Lingshu'''s earlier titles, they agree that the [[Han Dynasty|Han-dynasty]] ''Huangdi Neijing'' was made of two different texts that are close in content to the works we know today as the ''Suwen'' and the ''Lingshu''.

The ''Yellow Emperor's Inner Classic'' (''Huangdi Neijing'', 黃帝內經) is the most important ancient text in Chinese medicine as well as a major book of [[Daoist]] theory and lifestyle. The text is structured as a dialogue between the Yellow Emperor and one of his ministers or physicians, most commonly [[Qibo|Qíbó]] ({{zh | c=岐伯}}), but also Shàoyú ({{zh | c=少俞}}). One possible reason for using this device was for the (anonymous) authors to avoid attribution and blame (see pages 8-14 in Unschuld for an exposition of this).

The ''Neijing'' departs from the old shamanistic beliefs that disease was caused by demonic influences.  Instead the natural effects of diet, lifestyle, emotions, environment, and age are the reason diseases develop. According to the Neijing, the universe is composed of various forces and principles, such as [[Yin and yang]], [[Qi]] and the [[Five elements (Chinese philosophy)|Five Elements]] (or phases).  These forces can be understood via rational means and man can stay in balance or return to balance and health by understanding the laws of these natural forces.  Man is a microcosm that mirrors the larger macrocosm.  The principles of yin and yang, the five elements, the environmental factors of wind, damp, hot and cold and so on that are part of the macrocosm equally apply to the human microcosm.

==Date of composition==
The work is generally dated by scholars to between the late [[Warring States period]] (475-221 BC) and the [[Han dynasty]] (206 BCE–220 CE).&lt;ref name=wdl&gt;[http://www.wdl.org/en/item/3044/ Title: The Su Wen of the Huangdi Neijing (Inner Classic of the Yellow Emperor)]&lt;/ref&gt;

''Celestial Lancets'' (1980, by [[Joseph Needham]] and [[Lu Gwei-djen|Lu Gwei-Djen]]) states that the consensus of scholarly opinion is that the ''Suwen'' belongs to the second century BCE, and cites evidence that the ''Suwen'' is earlier than the first of the pharmaceutical natural histories, the 神農本草經 ''Shennong Bencao Jing'' (''Divine Farmer's Classic of the Materia Medica'').  So suggestive are parallels with third and fourth century BCE literature that doubt arises as to whether the ''Suwen'' might be better ascribed to the third century BCE, implying that certain portions may be of that date.  The dominant role the theories of yin/yang and the five elements play in the physiology and pathology indicates that these medical theories are not older than about 320 BCE.

Historian of science [[Nathan Sivin]] (University of Pennsylvania) is of the opinion (1998) that the ''Suwen'' and ''Lingshu'' probably date to the first century BCE.  He is also of the opinion that "no available translation is reliable."

The German scholar Paul U. Unschuld says several 20th-century scholars hypothesize that the language and ideas of the ''Neijing Suwen'' were composed between 400 BCE and 260 CE, and provides evidence that only a small portion of the received text transmits concepts from before the second century BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Unschuld, pp.1-3.&lt;/ref&gt; The work subsequently underwent major editorial changes.&lt;ref&gt;Sivin, p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Interlanguage link multi|Lu Fu|zh|3=呂複}}, a fourteenth-century literary critic, was of the opinion that the ''Suwen'' was compiled by several authors over a long period.  Its contents were then brought together by Confucian scholars in the Han Dynasty era.&lt;ref&gt;Unschuld, p.1&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars of excavated medical texts Donald Harper, Vivienne Lo and Li Jianmin agree that the systematic medical theory in the Neijing shows significant variance from texts found in the [[Mawangdui excavations|Mawangdui tomb]] (which was sealed in 186 BCE).  Because of this, they consider the Neijing to have been compiled after the Mawangdui texts.

==Wang Bing version==

In 762 CE, Wang Bing finished his revision of the ''Suwen'' after labouring for twelve years.  Wang Bing collected the various versions and fragments of the ''Suwen'' and reorganized it into the present eighty-one chapters (treatises) format. Treatises seventy-two and seventy-three are lost and only the titles are known.  Originally his changes were all done in red ink, but later copyists incorporated some of his additions into the main text.  However, the 1053 version discussed below restored almost all of his annotations and they are now written in small characters next to the larger characters that comprise the main or unannotated ''Suwen'' text. (See Unschuld, pages 40 and 44.)

According to Unschuld (pages 39 and 62) Wang Bing's version of the ''Suwen'' was based on Quan Yuanqi's (early sixth century) commented version of the ''Suwen'' consisting of nine ''juan'' (books) and sixty-nine discourses.  Wang Bing made corrections, added two "lost" discourses, added seven comprehensive discourses on the five phases and six qi, inserted over 5000 commentaries and reorganized the text into twenty-four juan (books) and eighty-one treatises. (See Unschuld pages 24, 39 and 46.)

In his preface to his version of the ''Suwen'', Wang Bing goes into great detail listing the changes he made. (See Veith, Appendix II and Unschuld pages 41–43.)

Not much is known about Wang Bing's life but he authored several books.  A note in the preface left by the later editors of the ''Chong Guang Bu Zhu Huangdi Neijing Suwen'' (version compiled by 1053 editorial committee) which was based on an entry in ''Tang Ren Wu Zhi'' (''Record on Tang [Dynasty] Personalities'') states that he was an official with the rank of ''tai pu ling'' and died after a long life of more than eighty years. (See Unschuld, page 40.  Also see Veith, Appendix I for a translation of an abstract from the 四庫全書總目提要 ''Siku Quanshu Zongmu Tiyao'' about both the ''Huangdi Suwen'' and Wang Bing.)

==Authoritative version==

The "authoritative version" used today, ''Chong Guang Bu Zhu Huangdi Neijing Suwen'' 重廣補註黃帝內經素問 (''Huangdi Neijing Suwen: Again Broadly Corrected [and] Annotated''), is the product of the eleventh-century Imperial Editorial Office (beginning in 1053 CE) and was based considerably on Wang Bing's 762 CE version. (See pages 33–66 in Unschuld)  Some of the leading scholars who worked on this version of the ''Suwen'' were 林億 Lin Yi, 孫奇 Sun Qi, 高保衡 Gao Baoheng and 孫兆 Sun Zhao.

For images of the ''Chong Guang Bu Zhu Huangdi Neijing Suwen'' printed in the [[Ming Dynasty]], (1368-1644 CE) see the external links section below.

==Recent studies==
The [[Chinese medicine history]] scholars Paul Unschuld, Hermann Tessenow and their team at the Institute for the History of Medicine at Munich University have translated the ''Neijing Suwen'' into English, including an analysis of the historical and structural layers of the ''Suwen''. This work was published by the University Of California Press in July, 2011.

Significant portions of the above ''Suwen'' translation (but with only a fraction of the annotations) are currently available in ''Huang Di nei jing su wen: Nature, Knowledge, Imagery in an Ancient Chinese Medical Text.'' (See Unschuld in cited references below.)

[Minister] Qibo answered: "The examination (zhen fa) [of the pulse] is usually [done] at dawn. The yin qi has not yet stirred, the yang qi has not yet dispersed, food and drink have not yet been taken, the [main] channel vessels [of qi and blood] are not yet overly active, the [qi and blood of the] network vessels [that branch out and enmesh the body] are harmonious and stable, and the qi and blood are not yet disordered -- thus, for these reasons, an abnormal pulse can be detected.

"Feel-closely the movement [and] the non movement of the pulse, then observe the essence clearness-brightness (jing ming). Examine the five colors [of the complexion] [and] inspect whether the five zang organs (internal yin organs) have overflowing-abundance [or are] insufficient, [if] the six fu organs (yang organs) [are] strong-and-powerful [or] weak, [if] the physical body &lt;[and] qi&gt; are flourishing [or] are decaying -- [then] integrate this set [of observations] to distinguish the demarcation [between] death [and] life.

Ping dan 平旦 is a Classical Chinese compound meaning: "dawn,"  but it is sometimes translated as: "calm dawn," but this is a literal character-by-character translation, "dawn" is more accurate.  Wiseman et al. in ''Fundamentals of Chinese Medicine: Zhong Yi Xue Ji Chu'', page 116: quotes part of the above ''Suwen'' passage.

'''Time:''' ''Elementary Questions (sù wèn)'' states: "The pulse should be taken at the calm dawn."&lt;sup&gt;128&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style="color:brown;"&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;128&lt;/sup&gt;Calm dawn, 平旦 (''píng dàn''): The name of the watch corresponding to 3-5 a.m.
&lt;/span&gt;
|}

While it is true that ping dan 平旦 is an ancient term for the third earthly branch time period which prior to the Song dynasty corresponded to 3-5 a.m. (Sôma, page 904), the other occurrences of ping dan in the ''Neijing'' (such as in treatise four) unambiguously mean "dawn," not the third earthly branch.  Further, the second paragraph in the above translation states the doctor is to observe the five colors of the patient, something that is not going to be accurately done at 3:00 - 5:00 a.m. using artificial light from an oil lamp or candle.  To correctly perceive the colors of the complexion without bias, natural lighting (i.e., full spectrum sunlight) would be needed.

Zhen fa 診法, can be translated as: "examination methods", "examination(s)" or "laws of examination."  Zhen 診 means: examine (verb) or examination (noun) and fa 法 is often translated as: law or method.  In this translation, zhen fa 診法 is translated more idiomatically as "examination" as opposed to a more literal reading as a compound meaning: "examination method" or "examination methods."

Qie mai dong jing 切脈動靜: "Feel-closely the movement [and] non movement (stillness) of the pulse," where dong jing 動靜 (movement [and] stillness) is likely a polar binome and thus denotes the whole action of the pulse and therefore this phrase could be translated as: "Feel-closely the entire pulse," or "Feel-closely the entire action of the pulse."  Qie mai is often translated simply as: "feel the pulse." (See Mathews' page 111, for example.) However, qie 切 also means: "intimate," so the term "qie mai" suggests feeling the pulse in a close or intimate manner.

Jing ming 精明, is often translated as eyes or pupils.  It may also mean the essence of the mind or emotions.  Thus, it may be referring to judging the mental and emotional state of the patient as well as the general level of vitality and spirit present as observed via the patient's eyes.

In treatise seventeen we have this passage
&lt;/span&gt;

The essence clearness-brightness (jing ming) is the means for observing all material-things, distinguishing white and black, examining short and long. To regard long for short, to regard white for black, if this [occurs] then the essence is feeble-and-declining!

&lt;blockquote style="border: 1px solid blue; padding: 2em;"&gt;
The laws of diagnosis [are as follows].&lt;br /&gt;
As a rule, it is at dawn,&lt;br /&gt;
before yin qi has begun its movement,&lt;br /&gt;
before yang qi is dispersed,&lt;br /&gt;
before beverages and food have been consumed,&lt;br /&gt;
before the conduit vessels are filled to abundance,&lt;br /&gt;
when the [contents of the] network vessels are balanced,&lt;br /&gt;
before the qi and blood move in disorder,&lt;br /&gt;
that, hence, one can diagnose an abnormal [movement in the] vessels.

Squeeze the vessels, whether [their movement] is excited or quiet, and observe
the essence-brilliance.&lt;br /&gt;
Investigate the five complexions.

Observe&lt;br /&gt;
whether the five depots have a surplus or an insufficiency,&lt;br /&gt;
whether the six palaces are strong or weak, and&lt;br /&gt;
whether the physical appearance is marked by abundance or decays.

All this is brought together to reach a conclusion [enabling one] to differentiate&lt;br /&gt;
between [the patient's] death and survival.

Mai Yao Jing Wei Lun
(The Essentials and Fundamentals of Diagnostic Palpation)&lt;/div&gt;

Yellow Emperor asked: "What is the diagnostic method in pulse palpation?" Qibo answered: "The palpation of pulse should be carried on in early morning, when the Yang-energy has not yet stirred, the Yin-energy has not yet been dispersed thoroughly, the food and drink of man have not yet been taken, the channel-energy then is not in hyperactivity, the energies of the collateral branches of the large channels are in harmony and the energy and blood have not yet been disturbed.  In this situation can the pulse condition be diagnosed effectively.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
"At the same time of diagnosing the dynamic and static variations of the patient's pulse, his pupils and complexion should be inspected, so as to distinguish whether his energies of the five viscera are abundant or not, his six hollow organs are strong or not, his physique and energy are prosperous or not.  When these aspects are considered comprehensively, one can judge the date of the death or survival of the patient.

17. Treatise on the Importance of the Pulse and the Subtle Skill of its Examination

The Yellow Emperor asked: "What is the way of medical treatment.?"

Ch'i Po answered: "The way of medical treatment is to be consistent.  It should be executed at dawn when the breath of Yin [the female principle in nature] has not yet begun to stir and when the breath of Yang [the male principle of life and light] has not yet begun to diffuse; when food and drink have not yet been taken, when the twelve main vessels (經 脈) are not yet abundant and when the ''lo'' vessels (絡 脈) are stirred up thoroughly; when vigor and energy are not yet disturbed—at that particular time one should examine what has happened to the pulse.

"One should feel whether the pulse is in motion or whether it is still and observe attentively and with skill.  One should examine the five colors and the five viscera, whether they suffer from excess or whether they show insufficiency, and one should examine the six bowels whether they are strong or weak. One should investigate the appearance of the body whether it is flourishing or deteriorating.  One should use all five examinations and combine their results, and then one will be able to decide upon the share of life and death.
&lt;br /&gt;

'''Jacqueline Worms de Romilly''' ({{IPA-fr|ʁɔmiji|lang}}; née '''David''',&lt;ref&gt;[http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/afterword/2010/12/french-scholar-jacqueline-de-romilly-dies-at-97.html "French Scholar Jacqueline de Romilly Dies at 97" ''Los Angeles Times''] 20 December 2010&lt;/ref&gt; 26 March 1913 – 18 December 2010) was a [[France|Franco]]-[[Greece|Greek]] [[philology|philologist]], [[classical scholar]] and [[fiction|fiction writer]]. She was the first woman nominated to the [[Collège de France]], and in 1988, the second woman to enter the [[Académie française]].

She is primarily known for her work on the culture and language of [[ancient Greece]], and in particular on [[Thucydides]].

==Biography==
Born in [[Chartres]], [[Eure-et-Loir]], she studied at the Lycée Molière. As a schoolgirl, she became the first female to qualify for a prize in the [[Concours général]], taking the first prize in [[Latin]] to French translation and second prize in [[Ancient Greek]] in 1930.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Webb|first1=Ruth|title=Women classical scholars : unsealing the fountain from the Renaissance to Jacqueline de Romilly' |editor-last=Wyles &amp; Hall |contribution=Jacqueline de Romilly|date=2016|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=9780198725206|page=377}}&lt;/ref&gt; She then prepared for the [[École Normale Supérieure]] at the [[Lycée Louis-le-Grand]]. She entered the class of 1933 of the [[École Normale Supérieure|ENS Ulm]]. She passed the ''[[agrégation]]'' in [[Classics]] in 1936; however, because she was of Jewish ancestry, the [[Vichy government]] suspended her from her teaching duties during the [[German occupation of France during World War II|Occupation of France]].&lt;ref name="Verweis"&gt;[http://www.parutions.com/pages/1-4-4-3976.html "D’origine juive, elle est suspendue de ses fonctions par le régime de Vichy en 1941."]&lt;/ref&gt; She became a [[doctor of letters]] at the [[University of Paris]] in 1947. Her doctoral thesis, a "masterful"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Munn|first1=Mark|title=The School of History: Athens in the Age of Socrates|date=2002|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley, Calif.|isbn=9780520236851|page=xi}}&lt;/ref&gt; treatment of [[Athenian Empire|Athenian imperialism]] in Thucydides, was published as ''Thucydide et l'impérialisme athénien'', and subsequently translated into English as ''Thucydides and Athenian Imperialism''.

After being a schoolteacher, she became a professor at [[Université Lille Nord de France|Lille University]] and subsequently at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]], between 1957 and 1973. She later was promoted to the chair of [[Greek language|Greek]] and the development of moral and political thought at the [[Collège de France]] — the first woman nominated to this prestigious institution. In 1988, she was the second woman (after [[Marguerite Yourcenar]]) to enter the [[Académie française]], being elected to Chair #7, which was previously occupied by [[André Roussin]].

In 1995, she obtained [[Greeks|Greek nationality]] and in 2000 was named as an Ambassador of Hellenism by the [[Greek Government|Greek government]]. A one-time president of the [[Association Guillaume Budé]], she remained an honorary president until her death at a hospital in [[Boulogne-Billancourt]] at the age of 97.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/carnet/article/2010/12/19/jacqueline-de-romilly-helleniste-et-academicienne-est-morte_1455554_3382.html|title=Jacqueline de Romilly, helléniste et académicienne, est morte|work=Le Monde|accessdate=19 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
De Romilly's two monographs on the ancient Greek historian [[Thucydides]] have been credited with "alter[ing] the landscape of Thucydidean scholarship"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lee|first1=Christine|title=(J.)

De Romilly also published outside the field of [[Greek historiography]]. In recent years, the value of her work ''Time in Greek Tragedy'' has been recognized by scholars working not only on [[Greek drama]] but also on [[Aristotle]]'s [[metaphysics]] of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Laurent|first1=Régis|title=An introduction to Aristotle's metaphysics of time : historical research into the mythological and astronomical conceptions that preceded Aristotle's philosophy|date=2015|publisher=Villegagnons-Plaisance Editions|location=Paris|isbn=9782953384611|page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Magnus |first=Erica W.|year=2016 |title=Time and Trace: Multidisciplinary Investigations of Temporality |editor1=Gross, S.|editor2=Ostovich, S. |contribution=Time, Cognition, and Attic Performance: Tracing a New Approach to Theatre History’s "Vexing Question" |publisher=Brill |location=Leiden}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6506">"'''Jerusalem of the West'''" was a term historically used by Jews to describe a non-Jewish city west of [[Jerusalem]] where the [[Jewish diaspora]] nonetheless enjoyed significant influence, freedom (of religion), and numbers, usually in Western Europe or [[Maghreb]]. Possibly its most persistent use was that of the [[Jews in Amsterdam|Jews of Amsterdam]].

==Applications==
===Amsterdam===
{{rquote|right|"Is Amsterdam, then. A Jewish town?"&lt;br&gt;
"Nay; but ‘tis the Jerusalem of the West."|''Dreamers of the Ghetto'', [[Israel Zangwill]], 1898.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=fN1e9FiGoxYC&amp;pg=PA82&amp;dq=%22jerusalem+of+the+west%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=mcWCTPy0OoGC8gbg-dyQAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CFEQ6AEwCTgU#v=onepage&amp;q=%22jerusalem%20of%20the%20west%22&amp;f=false Dreamers of the Ghetto], Israel Zangwill, 1898. pg. 82.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Prior to the [[Holocaust]], there were about 80,000 Jews living in Amsterdam.&lt;ref&gt;[http://spiegel.de/international/europe/a-926095.html Jewish identity in football clubs]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tlemcen===
In Northern Africa, [[Tlemcen]] in [[Algeria]] was called "Jerusalem of the West". In the 15th-century, the town was considered a major Jewish spiritual centre.&lt;ref&gt;John Hunwick.

Back Cover. {{ISBN|1-55876-346-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[André Chouraqui]] believed that there was a genuine geographical correspondence between the town and Jerusalem. He wrote: "We were living our dream in the midst of the beautiful countryside of the [[Maghreb]]. Tlemcen...resembles the city of David in altitude, climate, fauna and flora, to such an extent that we called in the Jerusalem of the Maghreb."&lt;ref&gt;Susan Slyomovics.

'''José Mariano Beristáin y Martín de Souza''' (22 May 1756 &amp;ndash; 23 March 1817) was a [[Mexico|Mexican]] [[Bibliography|bibliographer]] and [[author]] of one of the principal sources of knowledge of the bibliography of Mexico and [[Central America]].

==Biography==
He was born in [[Puebla]], Mexico, but went to Spain and spent some time in the family of the former Bishop of Puebla, then Archbishop of [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]]. Returning to Mexico (1811) he was made [[Archdeacon]] of the [[Mexico City Metropolitan Cathedral|Metropolitan church of Mexico]] (1813), and was afterwards its [[Dean (religion)|Dean]]. Beristain was a secular priest who had made thorough studies in Mexico and perfected them in Spain under the favourable circumstances. He wrote a number of treatises, some of them on economic subjects, but hardly any were published, the manuscripts being mostly lost in sending them to Europe. He died in Mexico.

His [[masterpiece|magnum opus]] is the ''Biblioteca hispano-americana septentrional'', the last part of which was published after his death. For this he used as a basis the ''Biblioteca mexicana'' of Bishop [[Juan José de Eguiara y Eguren]] of which only the first volume (as far as "J") appeared in print. Beristáin at first intended to republish Eguiara, completing the alphabet by means of sketches and notes left by the author, but, as he proceeded to carry out the idea, he found that it would be preferable to compose an independent bibliography, incorporating in it the material Eguiara had collected. of Beristain's ''Biblioteca'' contains many errors in names and dates. Taking into account the time when he wrote, and the distances from sources and their frequent inaccessibility, it has been considered by many as a monumental work.

{{Iron Age}}
{{synthesis|date=January 2018}}

The '''Iron Age''' is an archaeological age, the last of the [[three-age system]] of [[Old World]] prehistory.
It follows the [[Bronze Age]], in the [[Ancient Near East]] beginning c. 1200 BC, and in [[Iron Age Europe|Europe]] beginning
after c. 800 BC.
It is taken to end with the beginning of [[Classical Antiquity]], in about the 6th century BC, 
although in Northern Europe, the [[Germanic Iron Age]] is taken to last until the beginning of the [[Viking Age]], c. AD 800.

The term "Iron Age" is mostly limited to [[Iron Age Europe|Europe]] and the [[Ancient Near East|Near East]] and the [[Iron Age India|Indian subcontinent]], although
West Africa also has some iron metallurgy, beginning with the [[Nok culture]] c. 550 BC and spread by the [[Bantu expansion]].
There are also cast iron artefacts [[History of metallurgy in China|in China]] from about 500 BC, 
but use of iron was minimal, and the Bronze Age in China is usually extended to the beginning of the classical period ([[Qin dynasty]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="35618">This page lists chronologically '''the first achievements in cinema'''. The development of cinema is characterised by technological breakthroughs, from early experiments in the recording of day-to-day activity, experiments in colour, different formats and sound. From the 1970s, the development of [[computer-generated imagery]] has become integral to the way that films are produced.

In parallel with the developments in technology, its content and the way it reflects society and its concerns and the way society responds to it have changed too. The list attempts to address some of these events.

==19th century==

===1860s===

====1867-68====
* [[Chronophotography]] is the first time that movement is captured in several frames of print.

===1870s===

==== 1874 ====

* French astronomer [[Pierre Janssen|P.J.C. Janssen]] came up with the idea for a "revolver photographic". This huge camera system used a Maltese cross-type mechanism, very similar to the system that would later be of great importance in the development of movie cameras. He successfully captured both [[Transit of Venus|transits of Venus]], 1874 in Japan, that of 1882 at [[Oran]] in Algeria. The motion picture was known as [[Passage de Venus]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=The Passage of Venus|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3155794/|access-date=2018-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1890s===

====1889 or 1890====
*''[[Monkeyshines]]'', by [[William Kennedy Dickson]] and [[William Heise]]. Believed to be the first film shot in the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rowthree.com/2010/11/15/133-years-of-film-18891990-monkey-shines-no-1/|title=133 Years of Film:1889/1990 - Monkey Shines No. 1|publisher=Rowhtree.com|accessdate=2012-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; An experimental film made to test the original cylinder [[Kinetograph]] format.

====1891====
*''[[Dickson Greeting]]'' aka ''[[Monkeyshines]] 2'', by William Kennedy Dickson is the first public demonstration of motion pictures in the United States. The [[National Federation of Women’s Clubs]] are shown a 3 second clip of Dickson passing a hat in front of himself, and reaching for it with his other hand on May 20, 1891 at Edison's laboratory.

====1892====
*On 28 October 1892 [[Charles-Émile Reynaud]] gave the first public performance of a moving picture show at the [[Musée Grévin]] in [[Paris]], the [[Théâtre Optique]]. The show, billed as ''Pantomimes Lumineuses'', included three cartoons, ''[[Pauvre Pierrot]]'', ''[[Un bon bock]]'', and ''[[Le Clown et ses chiens]]'', each consisting of 500 to 600 individually painted images and lasting about 15 minutes. The film was the first to use [[film perforations|perforations]].

====1893====
*''[[Blacksmith Scene]]'', by [[William Kennedy Dickson]]. The first Kinetoscope film shown in public exhibition on May 9, 1893 and is the earliest known example of actors performing a role in a film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.silentera.com/PSFL/data/B/BlacksmithScene1893.html | title=PFSL : Blacksmith Scene | work=Silent Era |accessdate=2012-02-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The world's first film production studio, [[Edison's Black Maria|the Black Maria]], or the Kinetographic Theater, was completed on the grounds of Edison's laboratories at West Orange, New Jersey, for the purpose of making film strips for the [[Kinetoscope]]. Construction began in December 1892&lt;ref&gt;Robinson (1997). p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

====1894====
* On April 14, 1894, a public Kinetoscope parlor was opened by the Holland Bros. in New York City at 1155 Broadway, on the corner of 27th Street—the first commercial motion picture house. The venue had ten machines, set up in parallel rows of five, each showing a different movie. For 25 cents a viewer could see all the films in either row; half a dollar gave access to the entire bill.&lt;ref&gt;The machines were modified so that they did not operate by nickel slot. According to Hendricks (1966), in each row "attendants switched the instruments on and off for customers who had paid their twenty-five cents" (p. 13). For more on the Hollands, see Peter Morris, ''Embattled Shadows: A History of Canadian Cinema, 1895–1939'' (Montreal and Kingston, Canada; London; and Buffalo, New York: McGill-Queen's University Press, 1978), pp. 6–7. Morris states that Edison wholesaled the Kinetoscope at $200 per machine; in fact, as described below, $250 seems to have been the most common figure at first.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Dorlita in the Passion Dance'' Banned in New Jersey after use in peepshows. Russell Kick quotes the work ''Censorship'' as saying it "was probably the first [film] to be banned in the United States."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kick |first=Russ |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=The Disinformation Book Of Lists |publisher=The Disinformation Company |year=2004 |location= |pages=List 68: "16 Movies Banned in the U.S.", Pages 236–238 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=utssHzXYsWoC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=isbn=0-9729529-4-2&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q= |doi= |id= |isbn=0-9729529-4-2 |nopp=true}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''la Sortie des Usines'', the first film to be made in France.
*[[The Dickson Experimental Sound Film]] by William Kennedy Dickson.  It is the first known film with live-recorded sound and appears to be the first motion picture made for the [[Kinetophone]], the proto-[[sound film|sound-film]] system developed by Dickson and [[Thomas Edison]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmthreat.com/features/2082/|title=THE BOOTLEG FILES: "DICKSON EXPERIMENTAL SOUND FILM"|publisher=Filmthreat.com|accessdate=2012-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13694">'''[[Metaphor]]''', the description of one thing as something else, has become of interest in recent decades to both [[analytic philosophy]] and [[continental philosophy]], but for different reasons.

== Metaphor in analytic philosophy ==
In the Anglo-American tradition of [[analytic philosophy]] (in particular, in the [[philosophy of language]]), [[metaphor]] has attracted interest because it does not conform to accepted [[truth-conditional semantics]], the conditions which determine whether or not a statement is true. Taken literally, the statement "Juliet is the sun" (from ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'') is false, if not nonsensical, yet, taken metaphorically, it is meaningful and may be true, but in a sense which is far from clear. The comparison theory of metaphor asserts that one can express the [[truth value]] of a metaphor by listing all the respects in which the two terms are alike or similar; for example: Juliet is ''like'' the sun because she shares with it qualities such as radiance, brilliance, the fact that she makes the day and that she gets up every morning. However, this results in re-casting metaphor as [[simile]]. Because it can only explain the truth of metaphor by in effect losing metaphor, the comparison theory is rarely defended.

In contrast, two leading theorists emphasize the fact that [[truth conditions]] cannot be specified for a metaphor. [[Max Black]] maintains that metaphors are too open-ended to be able to function as [[referring expression]]s, and so cannot be expressions which have truth conditions {{Harv |Black|1962}}.  If metaphors are used in contexts where precise terminology is expected (for example, in a scientific theory), then their role, Black argues, is purely [[heuristic]], that is, they are means to an end or ways of assisting understanding, rather than being terms which can be tested for truth or falsity {{Harv |Black|1962| p= 37}}.  [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]] also thinks it a mistake to look for the truth conditions of a metaphor, since, in his words, "much of what we are caused to notice [in a metaphor] is not propositional in character", that is to say, metaphor is a prompt to thought which cannot be reduced to or contained by a series of [[truth conditions]] {{Harv |Davidson|1984| p= 263}}.  What metaphor does, Davidson maintains, is make us see one thing as something else by "making [a] literal statement that inspires or prompts the insight" {{Harv |Davidson|1984| p= 263}}.  Seeing one thing as something else is not the recognition of some truth or fact, and so "the attempt to give literal expression to the content of the metaphor is simply misguided".{{Harv |Davidson|1984| p= 263}}

Max Black develops the idea that metaphor actually creates insight or new meaning {{Harv |Black|1979}}. His interactionist theory asserts that at the heart of a metaphor is the interaction between its two subject terms, where the interaction provides the condition for a meaning which neither of the subject terms possesses independently of the metaphorical context. The primary [[subject (grammar)|subject]] in a metaphor, he claims, is coloured by a set of "associated implications" normally predicated of the secondary [[subject (grammar)|subject]] {{Harv |Black|1979| p= 28}}.    From the number of possible meanings which could result, the primary subject sieves the qualities predicable of the secondary subject, letting through only those that fit. The interaction, as a process, brings into being what Black terms an "[[Logical implication|implication]]-complex", a system of associated implications shared by the linguistic community as well as an impulse of free meaning, free in that it is meaning which was unavailable prior to the metaphor's introduction.{{Harv |Black|1979| p= 28}}

In a different, naturalist, approach, some English-speaking philosophers close to [[cognitive science]], such as [[George Lakoff | Lakoff]], have made metaphor the central aspect of human rationality.

== Metaphor in continental philosophy ==
Whereas analytic philosophy examines metaphor within the philosophy of language, [[continental philosophy]] assigns much wider significance to metaphor. This is because the climate within continental thought has been more favourable to the propagation of new branches of enquiry from nineteenth century German philosophy. Although [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] and [[Hegel]] sit quite happily on both analytic and continental curricula, it is only the latter which has seriously addressed the need to rethink how the world appears to us and how it is made manifest to us in the light of their [[metaphysics]]. Metaphor has proven to be extremely important for this rethinking because it is the process of conceptual borrowing or reassignment which revises our perception of the world.

The major shift which occurs in [[Kantian]] continental philosophy, according to Cazeaux, is the departure 'from dualistic thought, i.e. thinking which remains within the boundaries created by oppositions, such as mind—body and subjective—objective' {{Harv |Cazeaux|2007| p=4}}.  The turn away from dualistic thought is made by Kant on account of his representing experience as the subjective determination of an objective world, thereby placing in a relationship terms which normally stand as opposites in a dualism. As a result of this shift, without conventional dualisms to fall back upon, the process of conceptual borrowing and cross-referral presented by metaphor becomes central as the means by which the textures and complexities of experience can be articulated. Theses to this effect, but with significant differences, can be found in [[Kierkegaard]], [[Nietzsche]], [[Heidegger]], [[Merleau-Ponty]], [[Bachelard]], [[Paul Ricoeur]], and [[Derrida]].

To give two examples. According to [[Nietzsche]], we are in metaphor or we are metaphor: our being is not derived from a [[Platonism|Platonic]], eternal [[essence]] or from a [[René Descartes|Cartesian]] thinking substance but (in as much as there is a way of being we can call ours) is emergent from tensional interactions between competing drives or perspectives {{Harv |Nietzsche|2000}}. We customarily hold truth to be a relation of correspondence between knowledge and reality but, Nietzsche declares, it is in fact ‘a movable host of metaphors, metonymies, and anthropomorphisms’ due to the fundamentally metaphorical nature of concept-formation, a series of creative leaps from nerve [[Stimulus (physiology)|stimulus]] to retinal image (first metaphor) to sound as signifier (second metaphor) {{Harv |Nietzsche|2000| p=55}}.  Our categories, and the judgments we form with them, can never correspond to things in themselves because they are formed through a series of transformations which ensures that ‘there is no [[causality]], no correctness, and no expression’ connecting the first stage (the stimulus) with the last (the concept) {{Harv |Nietzsche|2000| p=58}}.

For [[Paul Ricoeur|Ricoeur]], metaphor is also ‘living’ – hence the title of his book, ''La Métaphore vive'' {{Harv |Ricoeur|1975}} (translated into English as ''The Rule of Metaphor'' {{Harv |Ricoeur|1977}}) – but in a different sense from Nietzsche .  Metaphor is living, Ricoeur claims, in that it is the principle which revives our [[perception]] of the world and through which we become aware of our creative capacity for seeing the world anew. This process, he thinks, is both paradoxical and Kantian in nature: paradoxical in that the creative combination of terms in a metaphor nevertheless produces meaning which has the character of a discovery (how can something be both a creation and a discovery?), and Kantian because the paradox mirrors Kant’s theory of experience in which the subjective application of concepts nevertheless yields perception of an objective world.  The tension between the subjective, creative and the objective, discovery aspects of a metaphor, Ricoeur argues, proceeds ‘from the very structures of the mind, which it is the task of [Kant’s] transcendental philosophy to articulate’ {{Harv |Ricoeur|1977| p=300}}.  Unfortunately, the part of Kant’s philosophy which Ricoeur appeals to is highly problematic: the [[Schema (Kant)|schema]] or schematism,  the operation which Kant dismisses as ‘an art concealed in the depths of the human soul' {{Harv |Kant|1929| p=183, A141, B180-81}}.  Ricoeur’s Kantianism is considered at length by Cazeaux {{Harv |Cazeaux|2007}} and Stellardi {{Harv |Stellardi|2000}}, with the former providing an account of how the schematism might afford a coherent explanation of metaphor.

Another reason for the attention paid by continental philosophy to metaphor is the questioning of boundaries – between subject areas and between the wider concepts of [[ethics]], [[epistemology]] and [[aesthetics]] – which has occurred within [[postmodernism]]. Principal concerns in these debates are the status of knowledge and the way in which the concepts of [[truth]] and objectivity are understood. Philosophy has been under attack on this score with its history of ‘universal truths’, e.g. [[Descartes]]’s cogito, [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]’s table of categories, and [[Hegel]]’s Absolute Consciousness. The main arguments against this universalism invoke metaphor on two related accounts: (1) the fact that key epistemological concepts have metaphors at their root, for example, “mirroring”, “[[Communication|correspondence]]”, “[[sense data]]”, is taken as evidence of the contingent, communal, subjective basis of knowledge, and (2) because metaphor (as a form of dislocated or dislocating predication) works by testing the appropriate with the inappropriate, it is seen as a means of challenging the boundaries whereby one subject defines itself in relation to another.

[[File:Otakar Hostinsky Vilimek.jpg|thumb|Otakar Hostinský.]]  
'''Otakar Hostinský''' (2 January 1847, [[Martiněves]] (near [[Litoměřice]]) – 19 January 1910, [[Prague]]) was a [[Czech people|Czech]] historian, [[musicologist]], and professor of [[musical aesthetics]].  He is known primarily for his support of [[composer]] [[Bedřich Smetana]] and his contributions to Czech aesthetic theory, which influenced many cultural figures in early twentieth-century Prague, including [[Zdeněk Nejedlý]], [[Otakar Zich]], and [[Vladimír Helfert]]. He also wrote the [[opera]] [[libretto]]s to [[Zdeněk Fibich]]'s masterpiece, ''[[The Bride of Messina (opera)|The Bride of Messina]]'', and [[Josef Rozkosný]]'s ''Cinderella''.

[[William Ewart Gladstone]] was [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister of Great Britain]] on four separate occasions between 1868 and 1894. He was noted for his moralistic leadership and his emphasis on world peace, economical budgets, political reform and efforts to resolve the [[Irish Question]]. Gladstone saw himself as a national leader driven by a political and almost religious mission, which he tried to validate through elections and dramatic appeals to the public conscience. His approach sometimes divided the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]], which he dominated for three decades. Finally Gladstone split his party on the issue of [[Irish Home Rule]], which he saw as mandated by the true public interest regardless of the political cost.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Shannon (historian)|Richard Shannon]], "Peel, Gladstone and Party," ''Parliamentary History'' (1999) 18#3 pp. 317–52&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shannon, ''Gladstone'' (1999) 2:401&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Christmas of 1867 [[John Russell, 1st Earl Russell|The Earl Russell]] announced that he would not lead the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] at the next general election and so Gladstone succeeded him as Liberal Party leader. The resulting [[United Kingdom general election, 1868|general election of 1868]] (the first under the extended franchise enacted in the [[Reform Act 1867]]) returned a Liberal majority of 112 seats in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]].

As prime minister 1868 to 1874 Gladstone headed a Liberal Party that was a coalition of Peelites like himself, Whigs and radicals; Gladstone was now a spokesman for "peace, economy and reform."&lt;ref&gt;Alan Sykes, ''The rise and fall of British liberalism, 1776–1988'' (1997) p. 73&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1870 and 1874 religious disputes played a major part in destroying the broad Liberal Party coalition. Disputes over education, Irish disestablishment, and the Irish universities showed the divergence between, on the one hand, Whigs, who wanted state control of education and the propagation of a nondenominational, morally uplifting Christianity, and on the other hand Gladstone and his supporters, who sought to guard religion's independence from a modernising civil power. This division struck a lasting blow to prospects of agreement on future policy over education and Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;J. P. Parry, "Religion and the Collapse of Gladstone's First Government, 1870–1874." Historical Journal 1982 25(1): 71–101 [https://www.jstor.org/pss/2638807 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Major legislation===
The first major reform Gladstone undertook was the disestablishment of the [[Church of Ireland]] as embodied in the [[Irish Church Act 1869]]. This was followed by the Landlord and Tenant Act of 1870 which attempted to protect Irish tenants from unfair treatment from landlords by lending public money to tenants to enable them to buy their holdings. The Act limited landlords' powers to arbitrarily evict their tenants and established compensation for eviction, which varied according to the size of holdings and was not eligible for those evicted for failing to pay rents.&lt;ref&gt;Sir Llewellyn Woodward, ''The Age of Reform, 1815–1870. Second Edition'' (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1962), p. 362.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gladstone's government also passed the [[Elementary Education Act 1870]], which provided England with an adequate system of elementary schools for the first time. It established a system of elective school boards which were founded to provide education where there were no voluntary schools. These boards had the power to levy rates and from which construct schools, employ teachers, and the ability to force children to attend (if they thought fit) those who were receiving no other education. They were also able to pay certain children's fees for voluntary schools.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Magnus, ''Gladstone. A Biography'' (London: John Murray, 1963), p. 204.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1871 Gladstone's government passed the [[Trade Union Act 1871|Trade Union Act]] making membership of trade unions legal for the first time. However, [[Picketing (protest)|picketing]] remained illegal, with the [[Criminal Law Amendment Act 1871]] making it a specific criminal offence punishable by three months' [[hard labour]] in prison.&lt;ref&gt;William Edward Hartpole Lecky, ''Democracy and Liberty: Volume II'' (Indianapolis: Liberty Fund, 1981), pp. 376–77.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ballot Act 1872]] was also passed, which established [[secret ballot]]s for general and local elections.

The [[Licensing Act 1872]] restricted the opening hours in public houses; regulated the content of beer; gave local authorities the power to determine licensing hours and gave boroughs the option of banning all alcohol. These policies were enforced by the police. This Act was generally unpopular and led to rioting in some towns.&lt;ref&gt;R. C. K. Ensor, ''England, 1870–1914'' (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1936), p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; The liquor industry had Liberal leanings before the Act but now this totally changed, and from "midsummer 1871 [when the first Licensing Bill was discussed] till the dissolution of 1874 nearly every [[Public house|public-house]] in the United Kingdom was an active committee-room for the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]]". Gladstone blamed the Act for the Conservative victory in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1874|1874 general election]], writing: "We have been borne down in a torrent of gin and beer".&lt;ref&gt;Ensor, ''England, 1870–1914''  p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1873]] remodelled the [[English court system]] (establishing the [[High Court of Justice]] and the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]]) and attempted to abolish the [[House of Lords]] as a judicial body for England, but this was not implemented due to the Conservative victory of 1874.

As Gladstone's [[Secretary of State for War]], [[Edward Cardwell, 1st Viscount Cardwell|Edward Cardwell]] enacted far-reaching reforms of the [[British Army]] in what would become known as the [[Cardwell Reforms]].

====Finance====
In 1868 Gladstone appointed [[Robert Lowe]] (1811–92) Chancellor of the Exchequer, expecting him to hold down public spending. Public spending rose, and Gladstone pronounced Lowe "wretchedly deficient." Maloney notes that historians concur on that. Lowe systematically underestimated revenue, enabling him to resist the clamour for tax cuts, and to reduce the national debt instead. He insisted that the tax system be fair to all classes. By his own criterion of fairness—that the balance between direct and indirect taxation remain unchanged—he succeeded. Historians point out that this balance had never been a good measure of class incidence and was by that time thoroughly archaic.&lt;ref&gt;John Maloney, "Gladstone's Gladstone? The Chancellorship of Robert Lowe, 1868–73." Historical Research 2006 79(205): 404–28.&lt;/ref&gt;

Public expenditure on the military and the navy by 1871 was at its lowest level since 1858. Overall, national public expenditure was reduced from £71,000,000 in 1868 to £67,000,000 in 1870 and 1871. However, it rose to £74,604,000 in 1874. Nevertheless, Gladstone was able to produce five surpluses for each year amounting to £17,000,000. He was also able (he resumed the office of [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] in August 1873 till the dissolution of Parliament in early 1874) to reduce the income tax to 3 pence in the pound in 1873, and the next year proposed to abolish it altogether if he won the next general election.&lt;ref&gt;F. W. Hirst, ''Gladstone as Financier and Economist'' (London: Ernest Benn, 1931), pp. 262–63.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Foreign policy===

In the aftermath of the [[Franco-Prussian War]] of 1870–71 Gladstone attempted to persuade the German Chancellor [[Otto von Bismarck]] to forbear from annexing [[Alsace]] and [[Lorraine (province)|Lorraine]] from defeated France. Gladstone published an anonymous article in the ''[[Edinburgh Review]]'' in October 1870 espousing his views, but it did not remain anonymous for long. The Germans remained unconvinced by Gladstone's overtures, however. France would regain both provinces in 1919 and 1944—but only after two World Wars with Germany.

During the [[American Civil War]] the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] ship [[CSS Alabama|CSS ''Alabama'']] had been built in an English port and had subsequently damaged [[United States|Union]] shipping. In 1872 Gladstone settled the ''[[Alabama Claims]]'' by giving the United States $15,500,000 as part of the [[Treaty of Washington (1871)|Treaty of Washington]].

===Army reform===
Gladstone paid little attention to military affairs but in 1870 pushed through Parliament major changes in Army organisation.  Germany's stunning triumph over France proved that the Prussian system of professional soldiers with up-to-date weapons was far superior to the traditional system of gentlemen-soldiers that Britain used.&lt;ref&gt; Ensor, ''England, 1870–1914'' pp. 7–17&lt;/ref&gt; The reforms were designed to centralise the power of the War Office, abolish purchase of officers' commissions, and to create reserve forces stationed in Britain by establishing short terms of service for enlisted men.&lt;ref&gt;Albert V. Tucker, "Army and Society in England 1870–1900: A Reassessment of the Cardwell Reforms," ''Journal of British Studies'' (1963) 2#2 pp. 110–41 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/175254 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Edward Cardwell, 1st Viscount Cardwell|Edward Cardwell]] (1813–1886) as Secretary of State for War (1868–1874) designed the reforms that Gladstone supported in the name of efficiency and democracy. In 1868 he abolished flogging, raising the private soldier status to more like an honourable career. In 1870 Cardwell abolished "bounty money" for recruits, discharged known bad characters from the ranks. He pulled 20,000 soldiers out of self-governing colonies, like Canada, which learned they had to help defend themselves. The most radical change, and one that required Gladstone's political muscle, was to abolish the system of officers obtaining commissions and promotions by purchase, rather than by merit. The system meant that the rich landholding families controlled all the middle and senior ranks in the army. Promotion depended on the family's wealth, not the officer's talents, and the middle class was shut out almost completely.  British 
officers were expected to be gentlemen and sportsmen; there was no problem if they were entirely wanting in military knowledge or leadership skills.  From the Tory perspective it was essential to keep the officer corps the domain of gentlemen, and not a trade 
for professional experts. They warned the latter might menace the oligarchy and threaten a military coup; they preferred an inefficient army to an authoritarian state. The rise of [[Otto von Bismarck|Bismarck]]'s new Germany made this reactionary policy too dangerous for a great empire to risk.  The bill, which would have compensated current owners for their cash investments, passed Commons in 1871 but was blocked by the House of Lords. Gladstone then moved to drop the system without any reimbursements, forcing the Lords to backtrack and approve the original bill.  Liberals rallied to Gladstone's anti-elitism, pointing to the case of Lord Cardigan (1797–1868), who spent £40,000 for his commission and proved utterly incompetent in the Crimean war, where he ordered the disastrous "Charge of the Light Brigade" in 1854.  Cardwell was not powerful enough to install a general staff system; that had to await the 20th century. He did rearrange the war department. He made the office of Secretary of State for War superior to the Army's commander in Chief; the commander was His Royal Highness The Duke of Cambridge (1819–1904), the Queen's first cousin, and an opponent of the reforms. The surveyor-general of the ordnance, and the financial secretary became key department heads reporting to the Secretary. The militia was reformed as well and integrated into the Army.  The term of enlistment was reduced to 6 years, so there was more turnover and a larger pool of trained reservists.  The territorial system of recruiting for regiments was standardised and adjusted to the current population.  Cardwell reduced the Army budget yet increased its strength of the army by 25 battalions, 156 field guns, and abundant stores, while the reserves available for foreign service had been raised tenfold from 3,500 to 36,000 men.&lt;ref&gt;Ensor, ''England, 1870–1914'' pp. 7–17&lt;/ref&gt;

==Second government (1880–1885)==
{{further|Second Gladstone ministry}}
&lt;!-- linked from redirects [[Second premiership of William Ewart Gladstone]], [[Second prime ministership of William Ewart Gladstone]] --&gt;
In the [[United Kingdom general election, 1880|1880 general election]] Gladstone's Liberals won 352 seats, a gain of 110, against 237 for the Conservatives and 63 for the Irish [[Home Rule League]]. It was a comfortable margin, but defections always seemed to whittle down the lead and sometimes produced defeat.  Despite his age Gladstone was an indefatigable leader and organiser, and the most brilliant speaker; however he wasted energy by serving as his own Chancellor of the Exchequer for a while. His Liberal party was increasingly factionalised between the smaller "radical" contingent and the larger "Whig" grouping.  Gladstone selected a relatively weak cabinet that favoured the Whigs. Even so, some Whigs were alienated because of his imperial policy, while the radical leader, [[Joseph Chamberlain]] broke away in because they opposed his home rule plan for Ireland.

It has been argued that Gladstone mishandled the [[Charles Bradlaugh|Bradlaugh]] affair, giving the opposition a religious cudgel which they used for years, with the result that his second ministry was not nearly as successful as the first.&lt;ref&gt;[[Roy Jenkins]], ''Gladstone'' (1997) ch. 26&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the first major pieces of legislation introduced by the new government was the [[Elementary Education Act 1880]], which enshrined the principle of compulsory education (for all children aged 5–10 years of age) into law for the first time.

In 1881 Gladstone was convinced that to pass a Land Bill for Ireland, law and order should be restored. In February 1881 the government therefore passed the [[Peace Preservation (Ireland) Act 1881]] which gave the [[Viceroy of Ireland]] powers to suspend [[habeas corpus]], and gave him in effect the power to lock up anyone he liked for as long as he liked. This was the Act used to arrest Irish Nationalist leader [[Charles Stewart Parnell]]. In August that year Parliament passed the [[Land Law (Ireland) Act 1881]] which gave Irish tenants "the three Fs"; fair rent, fixity (security) of tenure; and the right to freely sell their holdings.&lt;ref&gt;Magnus, p. 298.&lt;/ref&gt; Gladstone's government also passed the [[Arrears of Rent (Ireland) Act 1882]], which cancelled rent arrears for Irish tenants occupying land worth less than £30 per annum who were unable to pay.&lt;ref&gt;Magnus, p. 304.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Married Women's Property Act 1882]] gave married women the same rights to buy, sell, and own property as unmarried women did and had the effect of women being legally recognised as individuals in their own right for the first time in history.

Gladstone's second government also saw a number of electoral reforms. The [[Corrupt and Illegal Practices Prevention Act 1883]] aimed at eliminating corruption in elections and the [[Representation of the People Act 1884]], which gave the counties the same franchise as the boroughs—adult male householders and £10 lodgers—and added about six million to the total number who could vote in parliamentary elections. Parliamentary reform continued with the [[Redistribution of Seats Act 1885]].

Public expenditure was reduced to slightly under £81,000,000 in 1881 from the £83,000,000 inherited from the previous administration of 1879. However it rose to £89,000,000 in 1885.&lt;ref name="Hirst, p. 263"&gt;Hirst, p. 263.&lt;/ref&gt; For nearly three years into his second government Gladstone resumed the office of Chancellor. He abolished the tax on [[malt]] for the farmers, funding this by adding one pence on income tax and introducing a duty on beer, in 1880. In 1881 he reduced the income tax to five pence in the pound, funding this by increasing the duty on spirits, probates and legacies. In his last Budget in 1882 Gladstone added to the income tax.&lt;ref name="Hirst, p. 263"/&gt;

Gladstone's government was unexpectedly defeated on the Budget vote on 8 June 1885 and therefore Gladstone resigned the premiership the next day, with [[Lord Salisbury]] forming a minority Conservative administration.

===Foreign policy===
While in opposition Gladstone spoke out against Disraeli's aggressive imperialism. Especially in his Midlothian campaign speeches of 1880 he had expounded on his Liberal philosophy of government. The major concern of the campaign was with foreign affairs; with evangelical fervour he articlulated his vision of a world community, governed by law, and protecting the weak. The basis was universalism and inclusiveness; his emotional appeals reached to the sense of concern for others, rising eventually to the larger picture of the unity of mankind.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Kelley, "Midlothian: A Study in Politics and Ideas," ''Victorian Studies,'' (1960) 4#2 pp. 119–40&lt;/ref&gt;  Gladstone intended to restore right conduct and right principles when he returned to office, but public opinion—especially among the rural gentry—forced his government to continue imperial defence and expansion, most notably in Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Henry Colin Gray Matthew|title=Gladstone 1809–1898|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IHfBV9mB_v4C&amp;pg=PA374|year=1997|publisher=Oxford University Press|pages=374–413}}&lt;/ref&gt; At a time when France, Germany and others were rapidly expanding their empires, he opposed expanding the British Empire.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew, ''Gladstone,'' p 403&lt;/ref&gt;

Gladstone won the 1880 election on the back of his [[Midlothian campaign]] against Disraeli's support for the Ottoman Empire. He proceeded to reverse Disraeli's foreign policy by withdrawing the British garrison in [[Kandahar]] in Afghanistan and wanted to cede [[Cyprus]] to Greece, although he was dissuaded from this by [[Granville Leveson-Gower, 2nd Earl Granville|Lord Granville]].&lt;ref&gt;Magnus, p. 285.&lt;/ref&gt; Although he had denounced the annexation of the [[Transvaal Colony|Transvaal]] in the election campaign, he announced in January 1881 that self-government was not going to happen. The Boers rebelled against this in February and drove the British out by force at the [[Battle of Majuba Hill]]. Gladstone implemented the [[Pretoria Convention]] later in August which ended the [[First Boer War]]. In October in a speech at Leeds, Gladstone proclaimed: "While we are opposed to imperialism, we are devoted to the empire".&lt;ref&gt;Magnus, p. 287.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in 1882 a [[Urabi Revolt|nationalist revolt]] in Egypt headed by [[Ahmed Orabi|Colonel Urabi]] led to a riot in [[Alexandria]] whereby hundreds of foreigners were massacred. There was a danger to the [[Suez Canal]], the lifeline to India, as well as to British holders of Egyptian bonds.&lt;ref&gt;Maurice Shock, "Gladstone's Invasion of Egypt, 1882," ''History Today'' (1957) 7#6 pp. 351–57&lt;/ref&gt; At first, Gladstone appealed to the [[Concert of Europe]] to take collective action, although this was met by unenthusiastic responses. France refused to send military forces in fear of weakening France's defences against Germany. On 10 July Gladstone instructed that an ultimatum be given to Urabi to halt military fortifications of Alexandria within twelve hours. Urabi did not answer and so on 11 July the [[Royal Navy]] bombarded the city. This resulted in rioting and Gladstone got from Parliament £2,300,000 and raised the income tax from 5''d''. to 6½''d''. to finance a military campaign.&lt;ref&gt;Magnus, p. 290.&lt;/ref&gt; On 19 August British troops commanded by Sir [[Garnet Wolseley]] landed at [[Port Said]] and on 13 September defeated Urabi's forces at the [[Battle of Tel-el-Kebir]]. On hearing news of the British victory Gladstone was ecstatic and ordered salutes of the guns in Hyde Park in their honour.&lt;ref&gt;Magnus, pp. 290–91.&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1884 Gladstone consented to sending [[Charles George Gordon|General Gordon]] to the [[Sudan]] to report on the best means of evacuating Egyptian garrisons there in the aftermath of the [[Mahdi]] [[Muhammad Ahmad]]'s rebellion. When Gordon arrived in the Sudan he wanted to hold the capital, [[Khartoum]]. At first Gladstone refused to send a relief expedition but a few months later he consented and in October 1884 General Wolseley embarked from Cairo to Khartoum but arrived there too late to save Gordon, who had died when Khartoum fell to the Mahdi. "No single event in Gladstone's career made him more unpopular"&lt;ref&gt;Ensor, p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; and a vote of censure in the Commons reduced the government's majority to fourteen.

===Religious issues===
Enormous publicity was accorded the case of [[Charles Bradlaugh]], who was elected as a Liberal to Parliament again and again but could not be seated because he was an atheist. Bradlaugh was a conventional Liberal on most issues, but he was also a highly controversial proponent of birth control. The technical issue was whether an atheist could "affirm" his loyalty rather than "swear to God." Gladstone fought to get Bradlaugh seated, but took a legalistic approach which allowed the Conservatives to attack the Liberals with an appeal to religious sentiment. The Liberals were split and their cause suffered. Bradlaugh was finally seated in 1886 and in [[Oaths Act 1888|1888 Parliament passed a law]] that allowed affirmations instead of oaths.&lt;ref&gt;Walter L. Arnstein, "Gladstone and the Bradlaugh Case," ''Victorian Studies,'' (1962) 5#4 pp. 303–30&lt;/ref&gt;
  
With very little publicity Gladstone after 1880 was increasingly estranged from [[Queen Victoria]] on issues of Church of England patronage. Gladstone's policy was to nominate bishops and deans solely on the basis of merit and leadership ability.  The Queen, encouraged by Disraeli, favoured moderates who would restrain the High Church party (which tended to support the Liberals).&lt;ref&gt;Dudley W. R. Bahlman, "The Queen, Mr. Gladstone, and Church Patronage," ''Victorian Studies,'' (1960) 3#4 pp. 349–80&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Matthew, ''Gladstone'', pp. 338–40&lt;/ref&gt;

==Third government (1886)==
{{further|Third Gladstone ministry}}
&lt;!-- linked from redirects [[Third premiership of William Ewart Gladstone]], [[Third prime ministership of William Ewart Gladstone]] --&gt;
The [[United Kingdom general election, 1885|general election in November/December 1885]] saw the Liberals lose 33 seats but in January 1886 Salisbury resigned the premiership after losing a vote in the Commons and so Gladstone formed a government on 1 February. Historians point to his age as an explanation for his inflexibility.  He minimized the Radical role in his cabinet, with only Joseph Chamberlain representing that faction. The result was internal feuding that so weakened the cabinet that solid achievements were lacking. Historian  Donald Southgate argues:
:Gladstone, age and ailing, had lost his effectiveness....The party was suffering because the desire to preserve it took precedence, even with the leading Radicals, over the desire to employ it for any particular purpose, such as the grant of local representative institutions to Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;Donald Southgate, ''The passing of the Whigs, 1832–1886'' (1962), p. 385. &lt;/ref&gt;

Historian R.C.K. Ensor argues: 
:Never in the modern era has a triumphant House of Commons majority achieved so little....The reason was not merely the continuing economic unrest outside, nor the new phenomena of two oppositions—an Irish as well as a conservative.  It was that... there persisted a hidden [conflict] within the majority itself, which palsied the government's consuls and zigzagged its policy.... His own method of adjustment, which was to be radical in the open and whiggish behind the scenes, allowed neither side to feel secure.  Now, too, that he was past 70, mere egotism grew on him; and within a habit of playing this mystery—man and puzzling his followers by unexpected moves.&lt;ref&gt; Ensor, ''England: 1870–1914'' (1936) pp. 66–67.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Gladstone turned to Ireland. The [[Irish Government Bill 1886|First Home Rule Bill]] was introduced to Parliament on 8 April and the Land Purchase Bill on 16 April. [[Joseph Chamberlain]] and [[George Otto Trevelyan]] resigned from the Cabinet when Gladstone told them that he intended to introduce the bills.&lt;ref&gt;Southgate, ''The passing of the Whigs, 1832–1886'' (1962), pp. 386–89.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Land Purchase Bill enabled landlords in Ireland—mostly Protestants—to sell their land to their tenants for the price of 20 years' rent. The purchases were to be financed by government loans funded by £120,000,000 secured on British credit at 3%.&lt;ref&gt;Magnus, p. 352.&lt;/ref&gt; The bill was a shock to Liberals and brought down Gladstone's government in a matter of months. Irish nationalist reaction was mixed, Unionist opinion was hostile, and the election addresses during the 1886 election revealed English radicals to be against the bill also. Among the Liberal rank and file, several Gladstonian candidates disowned the bill, reflecting fears at the constituency level that the interests of the working people were being sacrificed to finance a rescue operation for the landed elite. The Land Purchase Bill was criticised from all sides and was dropped. The Home Rule Bill was defeated by 343 votes to 313, with 93 Liberals voting against.&lt;ref&gt;Ensor, ''England, 1870–1914,'' p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Graham D. Goodlad, "The Liberal Party and Gladstone's Land Purchase Bill of 1886," ''Historical Journal'' (1989) 32#3 pp. 627–41. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2639536 in Jstor]&lt;/ref&gt; Thus nothing was accomplished except the permanent disruption of the Liberal Party.

Men who left the Liberal Party now formed the [[Liberal Unionist Party]]. Gladstone dissolved Parliament and called [[United Kingdom general election, 1886|a general election]] which resulted in a Unionist (Conservative and Liberal Unionist) landslide victory under Salisbury.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Cawood, ''The Liberal Unionist Party: A History'' (2012) pp. 12–37.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{further|Liberal government 1892–95}}
&lt;!-- linked from redirects [[Fourth premiership of William Ewart Gladstone]], [[Fourth prime ministership of William Ewart Gladstone]] --&gt;
The [[United Kingdom general election, 1892|general election of 1892]] returned more Liberals than Unionists but without an overall majority. The Unionists stayed in office until they lost a [[motion of no confidence]] moved by [[H. H. Asquith]] on 11 August. Gladstone became Prime Minister for the last time at the age of 82, and was both the oldest ever person to be appointed to the office and when he resigned in 1894 aged 84 he was the oldest person ever to occupy the Premiership.&lt;ref&gt;Daisy Sampson, ''The Politics Companion'' (London: Robson Books Ltd, 2004), pp. 80, 91.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gladstone was the first Prime Minister to make it a condition of ministers to resign directorships of public companies in 1892. This was abandoned by Salisbury in 1895 and [[Arthur Balfour]] after him but was restored by Liberal [[Henry Campbell-Bannerman]] in 1905 and was observed ever since.&lt;ref&gt;Ensor, ''England, 1870–1914''  p. 210.&lt;/ref&gt;

Having to rely on Irish Nationalist votes, Gladstone introduced the [[Irish Government Bill 1893|Second Home Rule Bill]] in February 1893, passing second reading on 21 April by 43 votes and third reading on 1 September by 34 votes. However the [[House of Lords]] killed the Bill by voting against by 419 votes to 41 on 8 September. Gladstone wanted to call a general election to campaign against the Lords but his colleagues dissuaded him from doing so.

Public expenditure in the years 1892–93 was £80,000,000 with income tax at seven pence in the pound. In 1894 Britain's imports totalled £408,000,000, with total British-made exports at £216,000,000 (and the re-export of imports valued at £57,000,000).&lt;ref&gt;Hirst, p. 264.&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1893 an Opposition motion proposed by [[Lord George Hamilton]] called for an expansion of the Royal Navy. Gladstone opposed increasing public expenditure on the naval estimates, in the tradition of free trade liberalism of his earlier political career as Chancellor. Almost all his colleagues, however, believed in some expansion of the Royal Navy. Gladstone also opposed Sir [[William Vernon Harcourt (politician)|William Harcourt]]'s proposal to implement a graduated [[death duty]], which Gladstone denounced as "the most radical measure of my lifetime".&lt;ref&gt;Magnus, p. 417.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gladstone decided to resign the Premiership, ostensibly on health grounds, on 2 March 1894. The Queen did not ask Gladstone who should succeed him but sent for [[Archibald Primrose, 5th Earl of Rosebery|Lord Rosebery]] (Gladstone would have advised on [[John Spencer, 5th Earl Spencer|Lord Spencer]]).&lt;ref&gt;Magnus, p. 423.&lt;/ref&gt;

The office of the '''Protector of Aborigines''' was established pursuant to a recommendation contained in the ''Report of the Parliamentary Select Committee on Aboriginal Tribes, (British settlements.)'' of the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]]. On 31 January 1838, [[Charles Grant, 1st Baron Glenelg|Lord Glenelg]], [[Secretary of State for War and the Colonies]] sent [[George Gipps|Governor Gipps]] the report.

The report recommended that Protectors of Aborigines should be engaged. They would be required to learn the [[Australian Aboriginal languages|Aboriginal language]] and their duties would be to watch over the rights of [[Indigenous Australians|Aborigines]], guard against encroachment on their property and to protect them from acts of cruelty, oppression and injustice. The [[Port Phillip Protectorate]] was established with [[George Augustus Robinson]] as chief protector and four full-time protectors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor = Aplin, Graeme |editor2=S.G. Foster |editor3=Michael McKernan | title = Australians:Events and Places | year = 1987 | publisher = Fairfax, Syme and Weldon Associates | isbn = 0-949288-13-6|pages=47–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the role was nominally to protect Aborigines, particularly in remote areas, the role included social control up to the point of controlling whom individuals were able to marry and where they lived and managing their financial affairs.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

As well as Robinson, [[A. O. Neville]] and [[Edward John Eyre]] were notable Protectors of Aborigines.

[[Matthew Moorhouse]] was the first Protector of Aborigines in [[South Australia]]. He led the [[Rufus River massacre]], which slaughtered 30-to-40 Aborigines.&lt;ref name="SLSA"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[State Library of South Australia]] |url=http://www.samemory.sa.gov.au/site/page.cfm?u=1322#friction|title=Friction between overlanders and Australian Aboriginals|access-date=28 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Aborigines Welfare Board in [[New South Wales]] was abolished in 1969. By then, all states and territories had repealed the legislation allowing for the [[Stolen Generations|removal of Aboriginal children]] under the policy of "protection".{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1567">The '''Raqqa Newroz Killings''' were attacks on [[Kurd]]ish populations in [[Raqqa Governorate]] during [[Newroz]], the Kurdish New Year celebrations.

==Qamishli incident==
The first incident took place in March 2008, according to [[Human Rights Watch]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/en/news/2008/03/23/syria-investigate-killing-kurds|title=Syria: Investigate Killing of Kurds|date=23 March 2008|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Syrian security forces opened fire at Kurds celebrating spring festival of Newroz. The shooting left three people dead. The city is renowned for throwing a large Christmas parade every year in December, and celebrating Newroz festival by a large crowd every year in March.

==Raqqa City incident==
The second incident involved a [[Syrian police]] attack on the Kurdish population in [[Raqqa]] city, who had gathered to celebrate new Kurdish year ([[Newroz]] festival) in March 2010. The attack by Syrian police left 2 or 3 people killed, one of them a 15-year-old girl, and more than 50 people wounded.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rojhelat.info/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=198:2010-03-24-20-49-16&amp;catid=29:rojava&amp;Itemid=61]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rena Molho''' (1946) is a [[Greeks|Greek]] [[historian]] who focuses on the different aspects of [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] and [[History of the Jews in Greece|Greek Jewish history]] and culture and more specifically that of the Jews of [[Salonika]].

==Early life and education==
She was born in [[Thessaloniki]], [[Greece]], the original and official name of Salonika.

Molho studied [[European history]] at the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]], the [[Aristotle University of Thessaloniki]] and received a [[Doctor of Philosophy]] with distinctions from the [[University of Strasbourg]].

==Career==
She has taken part in many symposiums, television and radio programs, in Greece and abroad and has published her research in Greek and international scientific books, encyclopedias and journals. Her research has been supported with grants by the [[Memorial Foundation for Jewish Culture]] in New York City and by the [[Survivors of the Shoah Visual History Foundation]] in Los Angeles.

In 1996, she acted as senior interviewer and coordinator in Greece for the Survivors of the Shoah Visual History Foundation and has videotaped seventy Greek holocaust survivors' personal accounts.

Molho has taught the history of the Jewish presence in Greece in seminars organized by the [[International Study Groups]], and since 1991 with a group of other historians she co-founded the [[Society for the Study of Greek Jewry]].  For eight years, as of 1999, she taught the history of Greek Jewry at [[Panteion University]] in Athens, the first and only Greek academic institution to include the course of Jewish history in its curriculum in Greece until today. Her book ''The Jews of Thessaloniki, 1856&amp;ndash;1919: A Unique Community'' received the [[Athens Academy Award]] in December 2000 and in 2001 it was published in Greek by [[Themelion Publishing]]. After this, it became a university handbook distributed to Greek students of Jewish history. This book has been translated and will be soon{{when|date=March 2012}} published in [[Turkish language|Turkish]].

From 2005 to 2007, she was the Greek coordinator for [[Centropa]]([http://www.centropa.org]), a [[Vienna]], [[Austria]]-based Jewish historical institute which conducted a new series of audio interviews of Thessaloniki-born survivors who after 1945 returned and settled in Greece.

She has published a great number of academic articles in all the major European languages as well as in Greek, [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] and Turkish.

In 2010, she was decorated with the medal of the order of ''[[Ordre des Palmes Académiques]]'' for her contribution to the French academia.

Among her latest books, ''Salonica-Istanbul: Social, Political and Cultural Aspects of Jewish Life'' (2005) comprises a collection of eighteen studies in English and [[French language|French]] and was published by [[Isis Press]].

Her book ''Jewish Sites in Thessaloniki: Brief History and Guide'' (2009), published by [[Lycabettus Press]] in Athens, became a best seller, and was also published in Greek (2010) and in [[German language|German]] (2011).

Founded in 1565 by the [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]], the city was initially the seat of the [[Captaincies of the Portuguese Empire|Captaincy of Rio de Janeiro]], a domain of the [[Portuguese Empire]]. Later, in 1763, it became the capital of the [[State of Brazil]], a [[List of states of the Portuguese Empire|state of the Portuguese Empire]]. In 1808, when the [[Transfer of the Portuguese Court to Brazil|Portuguese Royal Court transferred itself from Portugal to Brazil]], Rio de Janeiro became the chosen seat of the court of Queen [[Maria I of Portugal]], who subsequently, in 1815, under the leadership of her son, the [[Prince Regent]], and future King [[John VI of Portugal|João VI of Portugal]], raised Brazil to the dignity of a kingdom, within the [[United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves|United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil, and Algarves]]. Rio stayed the capital of the [[pluricontinentalism|pluricontinental]] Lusitanian monarchy until 1822, when the [[War of Independence of Brazil|War of Brazilian Independence]] began. This is one of the few instances in history that the capital of a colonising country officially shifted to a city in one of its colonies. Rio de Janeiro subsequently served as the capital of the independent monarchy, the [[Empire of Brazil]], until 1889, and then the capital of a republican Brazil until 1960 when the capital was transferred to [[Brasília]].

{{Main|History of Rio de Janeiro|Timeline of Rio de Janeiro}}

=== Colonial period ===

Europeans first encountered [[Guanabara Bay]] on 1 January 1502 (hence Rio de Janeiro, "January River"), by a [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] expedition under explorer [[Gaspar de Lemos]], captain of a ship in [[Pedro Álvares Cabral]]'s fleet, or under [[Gonçalo Coelho]].&lt;ref&gt;Jorge Couto, 1995, ''A Construção do Brasil'', Lisbon: Cosmos.&lt;/ref&gt; Allegedly the Florentine explorer [[Amerigo Vespucci]] participated as observer at the invitation of [[Manuel I of Portugal|King Manuel I]] in the same
expedition. The region of Rio was inhabited by the [[Tupi people|Tupi]], Puri, [[Botocudo people|Botocudo]] and [[Maxakalí language|Maxakalí]] peoples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VifrCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT750&amp;lpg=PT750&amp;dq=Tupi,+Puri,+Botocudo+and+Maxakal%C3%AD&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=9JKlcjCXF5&amp;sig=XOenXzJwCiVmL515wMkWeqGZDQc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiU-cevyKXPAhVEAsAKHRxTDRsQ6AEIMTAC#v=onepage&amp;q=Tupi%2C%20Puri%2C%20Botocudo%20and%20Maxakal%C3%AD&amp;f=false |title=Encyclopedia of Consumption and Waste: The Social Science of Garbage
 |publisher= |accessdate=23 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1555, one of the islands of [[Guanabara Bay]], now called [[Villegagnon Island]], was occupied by 500 French colonists under the French [[admiral]] [[Nicolas Durand de Villegaignon]]. Consequently, Villegagnon built [[Fort Coligny]] on the island when attempting to establish the [[France Antarctique]] colony.

The city of Rio de Janeiro proper was founded by the Portuguese on 1 March 1565 and was named ''São Sebastião do Rio de Janeiro'', in honour of St. Sebastian, the [[Saint's name|saint who was the namesake and patron]] of the Portuguese then-monarch [[Sebastian of Portugal|Sebastião]]. ''Rio de Janeiro'' was the name of [[Guanabara Bay]]. Until early in the 18th century, the city was threatened or invaded by several mostly French pirates and buccaneers, such as [[Jean-François Duclerc]] and [[René Duguay-Trouin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paralumun.com/citrio.htm |title=History of Rio |publisher=Paralumun.com |accessdate=17 April 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081227075155/http://www.paralumun.com/citrio.htm |archivedate=27 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 17th century, still during the [[Sugar Era]], the [[Bandeirantes]] discovered gold and diamonds in the neighbouring [[captaincy]] of [[Minas Gerais]], thus Rio de Janeiro became a much more practical port for exporting wealth (gold, precious stones, besides the sugar) than [[Salvador, Bahia]], much farther northeast. On 27 January 1763,&lt;ref name="RobinsonRobinson2014"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Alex Robinson|author2=Gardenia Robinson|title=Rio de Janeiro Footprint Focus Guide: Includes Maracana Stadium, Copacabana, Paraty, Ilha Grande, Ipanema|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=joc_AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA28|year=2014|publisher=Footprint Travel Guides|isbn=978-1-909268-88-3|page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; the colonial administration in Portuguese America was moved from Salvador to Rio de Janeiro. The city remained primarily a colonial capital until 1808, when the Portuguese royal family and most of the associated [[Lisbon]] nobles, fleeing from [[Napoleon I|Napoleon]]'s invasion of Portugal, [[Transfer of the Portuguese Court to Brazil|moved]] to Rio de Janeiro.

===Portuguese court and imperial capital===
The kingdom's capital was transferred to the city, which, thus, became the only European capital outside of [[Europe]]. As there was no physical space or urban structure to accommodate hundreds of noblemen who arrived suddenly, many inhabitants were simply evicted from their homes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/folha/brasil/ult96u372084.shtml |trans-title=Arrival of the Real Portuguese family changes Rio's architecture |language=portuguese |last=Sobrinho|first=Wanderley Preite|work=[[Folha de S. Paulo]] |date=3 March 2008|title=Chegada da família real portuguesa muda a arquitetura do Rio |accessdate=17 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the first decades, several educational establishments were created, such as the [[Academia Militar das Agulhas Negras|Military Academy]], the Royal School of Sciences, Arts and Crafts and the [[Academia Imperial de Belas Artes|Imperial Academy of Fine Arts]], as well as the [[National Library of Brazil]] – with the largest collection in [[Latin America]]&lt;ref name="BNB"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cervantesvirtual.com/portal/fbn/presentacion.shtml |archivedate=10 October 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cervantesvirtual.com%2Fportal%2Ffbn%2Fpresentacion.shtml&amp;date=2012-10-10 |deadurl=yes |publisher=Fundação Biblioteca Nacional |trans-title=Presenting Brazil's National Library |language=portuguese|title=Apresentação da Biblioteca Nacional do Brasil |accessdate=10 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; – and The [[Rio de Janeiro Botanical Garden|Botanical Garden]]. The first printed newspaper in Brazil, the ''[[Gazeta do Rio de Janeiro]]'', came into circulation during this period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jornalorebate.com.br/site/index2.php?option=com_content&amp;do_pdf=1&amp;id=1083 |archivedate=10 October 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.jornalorebate.com.br%2Fsite%2Findex2.php%3Foption%3Dcom_content%26do_pdf%3D1%26id%3D1083&amp;date=2012-10-10 |dead-url=yes |title=199 anos do primeiro jornal impresso no Brasil |work=O Rebate |date=20 September 2007 |language=portuguese |accessdate=10 October 2012 |trans-title=199 years of Brazil's first printed newspaper}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Brazil was elevated to Kingdom in 1815, it became the capital of the [[United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves]] until the return of the [[Portuguese Royal Family]] to [[Lisbon]] in 1821, but remained as capital of the [[Kingdom of Brazil]].&lt;ref name="HCRJ"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Coaracy |first=Vivaldo |title=Memória da cidade do Rio de Janeiro |place=Rio de Janeiro |editor=Livraria José Olympio Editora |year=1955 |page=584}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the colonial period until the first independent decades, Rio de Janeiro was a city of slaves. There was a large influx of [[Slavery in Brazil|African slaves]] to Rio de Janeiro: in 1819, there were 145,000 slaves in the captaincy. In 1840, the number of slaves reached 220,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.multirio.rj.gov.br/historia/modulo02/africa_civiliza.html |title=A África civiliza |publisher=Secretaria Municipal de Educação da Cidade do Rio de Janeiro|language=portuguese |accessdate=17 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Port of Rio de Janeiro was the largest port of slaves in America.

When [[Pedro I of Brazil|Prince Pedro]] proclaimed the [[Brazilian Declaration of Independence|independence of Brazil]] in 1822, he decided to keep Rio de Janeiro as the capital of his [[Empire of Brazil|new empire]] while the province was enriched with sugar cane agriculture in the Campos region and, especially, with the new coffee cultivation in the [[Paraíba Valley]].&lt;ref name="HCRJ"/&gt; In order to separate the province from the capital of the Empire, the city was converted, in the year of 1834, in Neutral Municipality, passing the [[Rio de Janeiro (state)|province of Rio de Janeiro]] to have [[Niterói]] as capital.&lt;ref name="HCRJ"/&gt;

As a political center of the country, Rio concentrated the political-partisan life of the Empire. It was the main stage of the abolitionist and republican movements in the last half of the 19th century.&lt;ref name="HCRJ"/&gt; At that time the number of African slaves was drastically reduced and the city was developed, with modern drains, animal trams, train stations crossing the city, gas and electric lighting, telephone and telegraph wiring, water and river plumbing.&lt;ref name="HCRJ"/&gt; Rio continued as the capital of Brazil after 1889, when the monarchy was [[Proclamation of the Republic (Brazil)|replaced]] by a republic.

On 6 February 1889 the Bangu Textile Factory was founded, with the name of Industrial Progress Company of Brazil (Companhia Progresso Industrial do Brasil). The factory was officially opened on 8 March 1893, in a complex with varying architectural styles like [[Italianate architecture|Italianate]], [[Gothic Revival architecture|Neo-Gothic]] and a tower in [[Mansard roof|Mansard Roof]] style. After the opening in 1893, workers from [[Great Britain]] arrived in Bangu to work in the textile factory. The old farms became worker villages with red bricks houses, and a neo-gothic church was created, which still exists as the Saint Sebastian and Saint Cecilia Parish Church. Street cinemas and cultural buildings also appeared. In May 1894, [[Thomas Donohoe]], a British worker from [[Busby, East Renfrewshire|Busby]], Scotland, arrived in Bangu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Who is the true father of football in Brazil?|url = https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/24537173|website = BBC Sport|accessdate = 25 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Donohoe was horrified to discover that there was no knowledge of football among Brazilians. So he wrote to his wife, Elizabeth, asking her to bring a football when she joined him. And shortly after her arrival, in September 1894, the first football match in Brazil took place in the field beside the textile factory. It was a five-a-side match between British workers, and took place six months before the first game organized by [[Charles William Miller|Charles Miller]] in São Paulo. However, the Bangu Football Club was not formally created until 1904.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bangu-ac.com.br/historia.htm |title=Bangu Athletic Club History [Portuguese] |date= |accessdate= |website= |publisher= |last= |first= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160101115818/http://www.bangu-ac.com.br/historia.htm |archivedate= 1 January 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time Brazil's [[First Brazilian Republic|Old Republic]] was established, the city lacked [[urban planning]] and [[sanitation]], which helped spread several diseases, such as [[yellow fever]], [[dysentery]], [[variola]], [[tuberculosis]] and even [[black death]]. [[Francisco Pereira Passos|Pereira Passos]], who was named mayor in 1902, imposed reforms to modernize the city, demolishing the [[cortiço]]s where most of the poor population lived. These people, mostly descendants of slaves, then moved to live in the city's hills, creating the first [[favelas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pre.univesp.br/as-reformas-do-rio-de-janeiro-no-inicio-do-seculo-xx#.WP3sUfnysdU |title=As reformas do Rio de Janeiro no início do século XX |publisher=Universidade Virtual do Estado de São Paulo |date=7 May 2014 |last1=Suppia  |last2=Scarabello |first1=Alfredo |first2=Marília |language=pt}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inspired by the city of [[Paris]], Passos built the [[Theatro Municipal (Rio de Janeiro)|Municipal Theatre]], the [[Museu Nacional de Belas Artes|National Museum of Fine Arts]] and the [[National Library of Brazil|National Library]] in the city's center; brought [[electric power]] to Rio and created larger avenues to adapt the city to [[automobiles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://educacao.globo.com/artigo/reforma-urbanistica-de-pereira-passos-o-rio-com-cara-de-paris.html |title=Reforma Urbanística de Pereira Passos, o Rio com cara de Paris |publisher=[[Grupo Globo]] |language=pt}}&lt;/ref&gt; Passos also named Dr. [[Oswaldo Cruz]] as Director General of Public Health. Cruz's plans to clean the city of diseases included compulsory vaccination of the entire population and forced entry into houses to kill mosquitos and rats. The people of city rebelled against Cruz's policy, in what would be known as the [[Vaccine Revolt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://educacao.uol.com.br/disciplinas/historia-brasil/revolta-da-vacina-oswaldo-cruz-e-pereira-passos-tentam-sanear-rio.htm |title=Revolta da Vacina: Oswaldo Cruz e Pereira Passos tentam sanear Rio |work=UOL Educação |date=31 July 2005 |last=Cabral dos Santos|first=Marco |language=pt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1910, Rio saw the [[Revolt of the Lash]], where [[Afro-Brazilian]] crew members in the [[Brazilian Navy]] mutinied against the heavy use of [[corporal punishment]], which was similar to the punishment slaves received. The mutineers took control of the [[Brazilian battleship Minas Geraes|battleship ''Minas Geraes'']] and threatened to fire on the city. Another military revolt occurred in 1922, the [[18 of the Copacabana Fort revolt]], a march against the Old Republic's [[coronelism]] and [[café com leite politics]]. This revolt marked the beginning of [[Tenentism]], a movement that resulted in the [[Brazilian Revolution of 1930]] that started the [[Vargas Era]].

Until the early years of the 20th century, the city was largely limited to the neighbourhood now known as the historic city centre (see below), on the mouth of Guanabara Bay. The city's centre of gravity began to shift south and west to the so-called [[South Zone (Rio de Janeiro)|Zona Sul]] (South Zone) in the early part of the 20th century, when the first tunnel was built under the mountains between [[Botafogo]] and the neighbourhood that is now known as [[Copacabana (Rio de Janeiro)|Copacabana]]. Expansion of the city to the north and south was facilitated by the consolidation and electrification of Rio's streetcar transit system after 1905.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Boone | first1 = Christopher G | year = 1995 | title = Streetcars and Politics in Rio de Janeiro: Private Enterprise versus Municipal Government in Mass Transit Delivery, 1903–1920 | journal = Journal of Latin American Studies | volume = 27 | issue = 2| pages = 343–365 | doi=10.1017/s0022216x00010786}}&lt;/ref&gt; Botafogo's natural environment, combined with the fame of the [[Copacabana Palace]] Hotel, ''the'' luxury hotel of the Americas in the 1930s, helped Rio to gain the reputation it still holds today as a beach party town (although this reputation has been somewhat tarnished in recent years by favela violence resulting from the narcotics trade&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/world/americas/displaystory.cfm?story_id=14700720|title=Drugs and violence in Rio: The bottom line|accessdate=21 January 2010|date=22 October 2009|work=The Economist}}{{Subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

Plans for moving the nation's capital city from Rio de Janeiro to the centre of Brazil had been occasionally discussed, and when [[Juscelino Kubitschek]] was elected president in 1955, it was partially on the strength of promises to build a new capital.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cpdoc.fgv.br/nav_jk/htm/biografias/juscelino_kubitschek.asp Juscelino Kubitschek and the city of Rio de Janeiro]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150315094527/http://www.cpdoc.fgv.br/nav_jk/htm/biografias/juscelino_kubitschek.asp |date=15 March 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Though many thought that it was just [[Political campaign|campaign]] rhetoric, Kubitschek managed to have [[Brasília]] and a new [[Distrito Federal (Brazil)|Federal District]] built, at great cost, by 1960. On 21 April of that year the capital of Brazil was officially moved to Brasília. The territory of the former Federal District became its own state, [[Guanabara (state)|Guanabara]], after the bay that borders it to the east, encompassing just the city of Rio de Janeiro. After the [[1964 Brazilian coup d'état|1964 coup d'état]] that installed a [[Brazilian military government|military dictatorship]], the [[city-state]] was the only state left in Brazil to oppose the military. Then, in 1975, a presidential decree known as "The Fusion" removed the city's federative status and merged it with the [[Rio de Janeiro (state)|State of Rio de Janeiro]], with the city of Rio de Janeiro replacing [[Niterói]] as the state's capital, and establishing the [[Greater Rio de Janeiro|Rio de Janeiro Metropolitan Region]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://acervo.oglobo.globo.com/fatos-historicos/em-15-de-marco-de-1975-guanabara-rio-se-transformaram-num-unico-estado-10121382 |title=Em 15 de março de 1975, Guanabara e Rio se transformaram num único estado |work=Acervo O Globo |accessdate=22 April 2017|date=24 September 2013 |publisher=[[O Globo]] |language=pt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, Rio hosted the [[Earth Summit]], a [[United Nations]] conference to fight [[environmental degradation]]. Twenty years later, in 2012, the city hosted another conference on [[sustainable development]], named [[United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development]]. The city hosted the [[World Youth Day 2013|World Youth Day in 2013]], the second [[World Youth Day]] in South America and first in Brazil. In the sports field, Rio de Janeiro was the host of the [[2007 Pan American Games]] and the [[2014 FIFA World Cup Final]]. On 2 October 2009, the [[International Olympic Committee]] [[Bids for the 2016 Summer Olympics|announced]] that Rio de Janeiro would host the [[2016 Summer Olympics|2016 Olympic Games]] and the [[2016 Summer Paralympics|2016 Paralympic Games]], beating competitors Chicago, Tokyo, and [[Madrid]]. The city became the first South American city to host the event and the second Latin American city (after [[Mexico City]] in [[1968 Summer Olympics|1968]]) to host the Games.

==Geography==
[[File:Rio de Janeiro, satellite image, LandSat-5, 2011-05-09 (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.2|[[Satellite]] view of [[Greater Rio de Janeiro]]]]

Rio de Janeiro is on the far western part of a strip of Brazil's Atlantic coast (between a strait east to [[Ilha Grande]], on the [[Costa Verde (Brazil)|Costa Verde]], and the [[Cabo Frio]]), close to the [[Tropic of Capricorn]], where the shoreline is oriented east–west. Facing largely south, the city was founded on an inlet of this stretch of the coast, [[Guanabara Bay]] (Baía de Guanabara), and its entrance is marked by a point of land called Sugar Loaf (Pão de Açúcar) – a "calling card" of the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://riobrazilblog.com/where-is-rio-de-janeiro |title=Where is Rio de Janeiro? |publisher=Riobrazilblog.com |date=8 March 2011 |accessdate=12 March 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105085554/http://riobrazilblog.com/where-is-rio-de-janeiro |archivedate=5 November 2013  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Centre ([[Centro (Rio de Janeiro)|Centro]]), the core of Rio, lies on the plains of the western shore of Guanabara Bay. The greater portion of the city, commonly referred to as the North Zone (Zona Norte), extends to the northwest on plains composed of marine and continental sediments and on hills and several rocky mountains. The South Zone (Zona Sul) of the city, reaching the beaches fringing the open sea, is cut off from the Centre and from the North Zone by coastal mountains. These mountains and hills are offshoots of the [[Serra do Mar]] to the northwest, the ancient gneiss-granite mountain chain that forms the southern slopes of the [[Brazilian Highlands]]. The large West Zone (Zona Oeste), long cut off by the mountainous terrain, had been made more easily accessible to those on the South Zone by new roads and tunnels by the end of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history.com/topics/rio-de-janeiro Rio de Janeiro – History.com Articles, Video, Pictures and Facts]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110822105017/http://www.history.com/topics/rio-de-janeiro |date=22 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The population of the city of Rio de Janeiro, occupying an area of {{convert|1182.3|km2|sqmi|1}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ibge.gov.br/home/geociencias/cartografia/default_territ_area.shtm?c=5|title=Area Territorial Official |language=Portuguese |publisher=IBGE |accessdate=18 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; is about 6,000,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibge.gov.br/home/estatistica/populacao/estimativa2005/estimativa.shtm?c=1|title=Estimativas para 1° de Julho de 2006|language=Portuguese|publisher=[[Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics|IBGE]]|accessdate=18 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The population of the greater metropolitan area is estimated at 11–13.5&amp;nbsp;million. Residents of the city are known as ''[[carioca]]s''. The official song of Rio is "[[Cidade Maravilhosa]]", by composer [[André Filho]].

The city has parks and ecological reserves such as the Tijuca National Park, the world's first urban forest and [[UNESCO]] Environmental Heritage and Biosphere Reserve; [[Pedra Branca State Park]], which houses the highest point of Rio de Janeiro, the peak of Pedra Branca; the [[Quinta da Boa Vista]] complex; the [[Botanical Garden of Rio de Janeiro|Botanical Garden]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jbrj.gov.br/materias/07_10_2005.htm |archivedate=11 October 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.jbrj.gov.br%2Fmaterias%2F07_10_2005.htm&amp;date=2012-10-10 |deadurl=yes |publisher=Instituto de Pesquisas Jardim Botânico do Rio de Janeiro |title="Cochicho da Mata" recria floresta dentro da floresta |date=7 October 2005 |language=pt |accessdate=15 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rio's Zoo; [[Parque Lage]]; and the [[Passeio Público (Rio de Janeiro)|Passeio Público]], the first public park in the [[Americas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.inea.rj.gov.br/unidades/pqpedra_branca.asp|title=Parque Estadual da Pedra Branca (PEPB) |accessdate=22 September 2012 |work=Governo do Rio de Janeiro |publisher=Instituto Nacional do Ambiente |language=portuguese |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.inea.rj.gov.br%2Funidades%2Fpqpedra_branca.asp&amp;date=2012-11-18|archivedate=18 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition the [[Flamengo Park]] is the largest landfill in the city, extending from the center to the south zone, and containing museums and monuments, in addition to much vegetation.

===Environment===
Due to the high concentration of industries in the metropolitan region, the city has faced serious problems of environmental pollution. The [[Guanabara Bay]] has lost mangrove areas and suffers from residues from domestic and industrial sewage, oils and heavy metals. Although its waters renew when they reach the sea, the bay is the final receiver of all the tributaries generated along its banks and in the basins of the many rivers and streams that flow into it. The levels of particulate matter in the air are twice as high as that recommended by the [[World Health Organization]], in part because of the large numbers of vehicles in circulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/folha/cotidiano/ult95u330220.shtml |work=Folha Online |author=Afra Balazina |title=Estudo revela poluição elevada em seis capitais |date=21 September 2007|language=portuguese|trans-title=Study reveals high pollution levels in six capitals |accessdate=26 October 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071221042944/http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/folha/cotidiano/ult95u330220.shtml |dead-url=no |archivedate=21 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The waters of Sepetiba Bay are slowly following the path traced by Guanabara Bay, with sewage generated by a population of the order of 1.29 million inhabitants being released without treatment in streams or rivers. With regard to industrial pollution, highly toxic wastes, with high concentrations of heavy metals – mainly [[zinc]] and [[cadmium]] – have been dumped over the years by factories in the industrial districts of [[Santa Cruz, Rio de Janeiro|Santa Cruz]], [[Itaguaí]] and [[Nova Iguaçu]], constructed under the supervision of State policies.&lt;ref name="OQ"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.koinonia.org.br/oq/dossies/marambaia/not_contexto1.htm |publisher=Observatório Quilombola (OQ) |title=Contexto ambiental da Baía de Sepetiba |year=2001 |language=pt|accessdate=26 October 2008|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.koinonia.org.br%2Foq%2Fdossies%2Fmarambaia%2Fnot_contexto1.htm&amp;date=2012-11-18|archivedate=18 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Marapendi lagoon and the [[Rodrigo de Freitas Lagoon]] have suffered with the leniency of the authorities and the growth in the number of apartment buildings close by. The clandestine discharge of sewage and the consequent proliferation of algae diminish the oxygenation of the waters, causing fish mortality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sidneyrezende.com/noticia/116507+lagoa+de+marapendi+sofre+com+poluicao+da+agua|title=Lagoa de Marapendi sofre com poluição da água|trans-title=Marapendi Lagoon suffers with water pollution|author=Hélio Almeida|date=11 January 2011|language=pt|accessdate=18 November 2012|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sidneyrezende.com%2Fnoticia%2F116507%2Blagoa%2Bde%2Bmarapendi%2Bsofre%2Bcom%2Bpoluicao%2Bda%2Bagua&amp;date=2012-11-18|archivedate=18 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.estadao.com.br/noticias/vidae,lagoa-rodrigo-de-freitas-estara-despoluida-ate-2014-diz-secretario,553395,0.htm|title=Lagoa Rodrigo de Freitas estará despoluída até 2014, diz secretário|author=Agência Brasil|date=18 May 2010|work=O Estado de S.

There are, on the other hand, signs of decontamination in the lagoon made through a [[public-private partnership]] established in 2008 to ensure that the lagoon waters will eventually be suitable for bathing. The decontamination actions involve the transfer of sludge to large craters present in the lagoon itself, and the creation of a new direct and underground connection with the sea, which will contribute to increase the daily water exchange between the two environments. However, during the Olympics the lagoon hosted the rowing competitions and there were numerous concerns about potential infection resulting from human sewage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=For rowers in Rio's Olympic water, it's all about avoiding the splash|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/international/ct-olympic-rowing-dirty-water-20160806-story.html|publisher=Chicago Tribune|accessdate=8 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rio has a [[tropical savanna climate]] (''Aw'') that closely borders a [[tropical monsoon climate]] (''Am'') according to the [[Köppen climate classification]], and is often characterized by long periods of heavy rain between December and March.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Köppen's climate classification map for Brazil

In inland areas of the city, temperatures above {{convert|40|°C|0|abbr=on}} are common during the summer, though rarely for long periods, while maximum temperatures above {{convert|27|°C|0|abbr=on}} can occur on a monthly basis.

Along the coast, the breeze, blowing onshore and offshore, moderates the temperature. Because of its geographic situation, the city is often reached by cold fronts advancing from [[Antarctica]], especially during autumn and winter, causing frequent weather changes. In summer there can be strong rains, which have, on some occasions, provoked catastrophic floods and landslides. The mountainous areas register greater rainfall since they constitute a barrier to the humid wind that comes from the Atlantic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/weather/3451190|title=BBC Weather – Rio de Janeiro|work=BBC Weather|accessdate=14 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the Portuguese word for Flemish, and it was given to the nearby beach (Praia do Flamengo, Beach of the Flemish) because it was the place where the Dutch sailor Olivier van Noort tried to invade the city in 1599. At that time, the Dutchmen were called "Flemish" by the Portuguese.

The city reputedly has had rare [[frost]]s in the past, but this has never been decisively confirmed. Some areas within [[Rio de Janeiro state]] occasionally have falls of [[snow grains]] and [[ice pellets]] (popularly called {{lang|pt|granizo}}, or "hail", although it is in fact melted and refrozen snow falling in the form of [[hail]], rather than just icy snow). These phenomena are definitely not rare or limited to a few regions,{{Original research inline|date=February 2016}} having already happened in the metropolitan area (including western suburbs of the city itself) several times in the 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://globotv.globo.com/globo-news/jornal-globo-news/v/chuva-de-granizo-atinge-zona-oeste-e-baixada-fluminense-do-rio/1853797/|title=Hail falls in Rio de Janeiro's West Zone and Baixada Fluminense |publisher=Globo News|date=12 March 2012 | accessdate=15 March 2012|language=pt}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | language=pt | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2c-u7vOEdk | title=Chuvinha de granizo - Nova Iguaçu 18-2-2013 | trans-title=Little hail shower – Nova Iguaçu, 18 February 2013 | publisher=YouTube | date=18 February 2013 | accessdate=26 August 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://g1.globo.com/rio-de-janeiro/noticia/2015/01/com-chuva-de-granizo-rio-entra-em-estagio-de-atencao.html|title=As hail falls, Rio enters a warning interval |publisher=G1|date=28 January 2015 | accessdate=2 February 2015|language=pt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Drought is very rare, albeit bound to happen occasionally given the city's strongly seasonal tropical climate. The Brazilian drought of 2014–2015, most severe in the [[Southeast Region, Brazil|Southeast Region]] and the worst in decades, affected the entire metropolitan region's water supply (a diversion from the [[Paraíba do Sul]] River to the [[Guandu River (Rio de Janeiro)|Guandu]] River is a major source for the state's most populous mesoregion). There were plans to divert the Paraíba do Sul to the [[Sistema Cantareira]] (Cantareira system) during the water crisis of 2014 in order to help the critically drought-stricken [[Greater São Paulo]] area. However, availability of sufficient rainfall to supply tap water to both metropolitan areas in the future is merely speculative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.theguardian.com/weather/2014/sep/05/brazil-drought-crisis-rationing|title=Brazil drought crisis leads to rationing and tensions |work=The Guardian|date=5 September 2014 | accessdate=2 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/23/brazil-worst-drought-history|title=Brazil's worst drought in history prompts protests and blackouts |publisher=The Guardian|date=23 January 2015 | accessdate=2 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://g1.globo.com/fantastico/noticia/2015/02/rio-paraiba-do-sul-pode-nao-ter-agua-para-socorrer-sistema-cantareira.html|title=Paraíba do Sul River might not have enough water to rescue São Paulo's Sistema Cantareira |publisher=G1|date=1 February 2015 | accessdate=2 February 2015|language=pt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roughly in the same suburbs ([[Nova Iguaçu]] and surrounding areas, including parts of Campo Grande and Bangu) that correspond to the location of the March 2012, February–March 2013 and January 2015 pseudo-hail (''granizo'') falls, there was a [[tornado]]-like phenomenon in January 2011, for the first time in the region's recorded history, causing structural damage and long-lasting [[Power outage|blackouts]], but no fatalities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://g1.globo.com/bom-dia-brasil/noticia/2011/01/tornado-causa-destruicao-em-nova-iguacu-no-rio-de-janeiro.html|title=Tornado is responsible for havoc in Nova Iguaçu, Rio de Janeiro |publisher=Globo|date=20 January 2011 | accessdate=11 April 2012|language=pt}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="9guaçutornado"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.gazetadopovo.com.br/chuvadevastadora/conteudo.phtml?tl=1&amp;id=1088896&amp;tit=Tornado-causa-estragos-em-Nova-Iguacu|title=Tornado is responsible for havoc in Nova Iguaçu |publisher=Gazeta do Povo|date=21 January 2011 | accessdate=11 April 2012|language=pt}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[World Meteorological Organization]] has advised that Brazil, especially its southeastern region, must be prepared for increasingly [[severe weather]] occurrences in the near future, since events such as the catastrophic [[January 2011 Rio de Janeiro floods and mudslides]] are not an isolated phenomenon.

Temperature also varies according to elevation, distance from the coast, and type of vegetation or land use. Winter, cold fronts and dawn/morning sea breezes bring mild temperatures; cold fronts, the [[Intertropical Convergence Zone]] (in the form of winds from the [[Amazon Forest]]), the strongest sea-borne winds (often from an [[extratropical cyclone]]) and summer [[evapotranspiration]] bring showers or storms. Thus the monsoon-like climate has dry and mild winters and springs, and very wet and warm summers and autumns.

Rio de Janeiro is second only to [[Cuiabá]] as the hottest Brazilian state capital outside [[North Region, Brazil|Northern]] and [[Northeast Region, Brazil|Northeastern]] Brazil; temperatures below {{convert|14|°C|0|abbr=on}} occur yearly, while those lower than {{convert|11|°C|0|abbr=on}} happen less often. The phrase, ''fazer frio'' ("making cold", i.e. "the weather is getting cold"), usually refers to temperatures going below {{convert|21|°C|0|abbr=on}}, which is possible year-round and is commonplace in mid-to-late autumn, winter and early spring nights.

Between 1961 and 1990, at the INMET (Brazilian National Institute of Meteorology) conventional station in the neighborhood of [[Saúde, Rio de Janeiro|Saúde]], the lowest temperature recorded was {{convert|10.1|°C|1|abbr=on}} in October 1977,&lt;ref name="RecordLowC_INMET"/&gt; and the highest temperature recorded was {{convert|39|°C|1|abbr=on}} in December 1963.&lt;ref name="RecordHighC_INMET"/&gt; The highest accumulated rainfall in 24 hours was {{convert|167.4|mm|1|abbr=on}} in January 1962.&lt;ref name="RainfallAbsoluteINMET"/&gt; However, the absolute minimum temperature ever recorded at the INMET [[Jacarepaguá, Rio de Janeiro|Jacarepaguá]] station, {{convert|3.8|°C|1|abbr=on}} in July 1974,&lt;ref name="RecordLowC_INMET"/&gt; while the absolute maximum was {{convert|43.2|°C|0|abbr=on}} 26 December 2012,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://g1.globo.com/rio-de-janeiro/noticia/2012/12/temperatura-desta-quarta-e-mais-alta-no-rio-em-29-anos-diz-inmet.html|title=Temperatura desta quarta no Rio é recorde histórico, diz Inmet|date=26 December 2012|language=Portuguese|publisher=G1 Rio de Janeiro|accessdate=8 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the neighborhood of the [[Santa Cruz, Rio de Janeiro|Santa Cruz]] station, while the highest accumulated rainfall in 24 hours, of {{convert|186.2|mm|1|abbr=on}} was recorded at the [[Santa Teresa, Rio de Janeiro|Santa Teresa]] station in April 1967.&lt;ref name="RainfallAbsoluteINMET"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inmet.gov.br/webcdp/climatologia/normais/imagens/normais/planilhas/Maximo-Abs-Precipitacao_NCB_1961-1990.xls |title=Máximo Absoluto de Precipitação Acumulada (mm) |publisher=Brazilian National Institute of Meteorology |language=Portuguese |accessdate=8 September 2014 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6PQ0OO2Uc?url=http://www.inmet.gov.br/webcdp/climatologia/normais/imagens/normais/planilhas/Maximo-Abs-Precipitacao_NCB_1961-1990.xls |archivedate=8 May 2014 |deadurl=yes  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The lowest temperature ever registered in the 21st century was {{convert|8.1|°C|1|abbr=on}} in Vila Militar, July 2011.&lt;ref name="portal web Terra"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://noticias.terra.com.br/brasil/noticias/0,,OI5232398-EI8139,00-Rio+de+Janeiro+tem+madrugada+mais+fria+desde+o+ano.html |title=Record lowest temperature since {{convert|7.3|°C|1}} in 2000 |accessdate=1 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The wettest and driest months tend to be January and August respectively.

The city is commonly divided into the historic center (Centro); the tourist-friendly wealthier South Zone (Zona Sul); the residential less wealthy North Zone (Zona Norte); peripheries in the West Zone (Zona Oeste), among them [[Santa Cruz, Rio de Janeiro|Santa Cruz]], [[Campo Grande, Rio de Janeiro|Campo Grande]] and the wealthy newer [[Barra da Tijuca]] district.

===Central Zone===
{{Main|Zona Central, Rio de Janeiro|Centro, Rio de Janeiro}}
[[File:Centro do Rio visto do museu chácara do céu.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.4|Aerial view of [[Centro (Rio de Janeiro)|Downtown Rio]]]]

Centro or Downtown is the historic core of the city, as well as its [[financial centre]]. Sites of interest include the [[Paço Imperial]], built during colonial times to serve as a residence for the Portuguese governors of Brazil; many historic churches, such as the [[Candelária Church]] (the former cathedral), São Jose, Santa Lucia, Nossa Senhora do Carmo, Santa Rita, São Francisco de Paula, and the monasteries of Santo Antônio and São Bento. The Centro also houses the modern concrete [[Rio de Janeiro Cathedral]].  Around the [[Cinelândia]] square, there are several landmarks of the ''[[Belle Époque]]'' of Rio, such as the [[Teatro Municipal (Rio de Janeiro)|Municipal Theatre]] and the [[National library|National Library]] building.

Among its several museums, the [[Museu Nacional de Belas Artes]] (National Museum of Fine Arts) and the [[National Historical Museum (Brazil)|Museu Histórico Nacional]] (National Historical Museum) are the most important. Other important historical attractions in central Rio include its [[Passeio Público (Rio de Janeiro)|Passeio Público]], an 18th-century public garden. Major streets include Avenida Rio Branco and Avenida Vargas, both constructed, in 1906 and 1942 respectively, by destroying large swaths of the colonial city. A number of colonial streets, such as Rua do Ouvidor and Uruguaiana, have long been pedestrian spaces, and the popular Saara shopping district has been pedestrianized more recently. Also located in the center is the traditional neighbourhood called [[Lapa, Rio de Janeiro|Lapa]], an important bohemian area frequented by both townspeople and tourists.

===South Zone===

[[File:Bondinho chegando no Pão de Açúcar.JPG|thumb|[[Sugarloaf Cable Car|Cablecar]] arriving at [[Sugarloaf Mountain (Brazil)|Sugarloaf]]]]

The South Zone of Rio de Janeiro ({{lang|pt|Zona Sul}}) is composed of several districts, among which are [[São Conrado]], [[Leblon]], [[Ipanema]], [[Arpoador]], [[Copacabana (Rio de Janeiro)|Copacabana]], and [[Leme (Rio de Janeiro)|Leme]], which compose Rio's famous [https://web.archive.org/web/20131022024238/http://rio2014.info/praias-melhores-de-rio-de-janeiro-best-beaches-rio-de-janeiro/ Atlantic beach coastline]. Other districts in the South Zone are Glória, Catete, [[Flamengo, Rio de Janeiro|Flamengo]], [[Botafogo]], and [[Urca]], which border [[Guanabara Bay]], and [[Santa Teresa (Rio de Janeiro)|Santa Teresa]], [[Cosme Velho]], [[Laranjeiras]], [[Humaitá, Rio de Janeiro|Humaitá]], [[Lagoa, Rio de Janeiro|Lagoa]], [[Jardim Botânico, Rio de Janeiro|Jardim Botânico]], and [[Gávea]]. It is the wealthiest part of the city and the best known overseas; the neighborhoods of Leblon and Ipanema, in particular, have the most expensive real estate in all of South America.

The neighbourhood of Copacabana beach hosts one of the world's most spectacular New Year's Eve parties ("Reveillon"), as more than two million revelers crowd onto the sands to watch the [[fireworks|fireworks display]]. From 2001, the fireworks have been launched from boats, to improve the safety of the event.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vermelho.org.br/diario/2006/0104/zillah_0104.asp?nome=Zillah%20Branco&amp;cod=5264 Rio Reveillon]   {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013145446/http://www.vermelho.org.br/diario/2006/0104/zillah_0104.asp?nome=Zillah%20Branco&amp;cod=5264 |date=13 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; To the north of Leme, and at the entrance to Guanabara Bay, is the district of [[Urca]] and the [[Sugarloaf Mountain (Brazil)|Sugarloaf Mountain]] ('Pão de Açúcar'), whose name describes the famous mountain rising out of the sea. The summit can be reached via a two-stage [[Aerial tramway|cable car]] trip from Praia Vermelha, with the intermediate stop on Morro da Urca. It offers views of the city second only to Corcovado mountain. [[Hang gliding]] is a popular activity on the Pedra Bonita (literally, "Beautiful Rock"). After a short flight, gliders land on the Praia do Pepino (''Pepino'', or "[[cucumber]]", Beach) in São Conrado.

Since 1961, the [[Tijuca Forest|Tijuca National Park]] (Parque Nacional da Tijuca), the largest city-surrounded [[urban forest]] and the second largest urban forest in the world, has been a National Park. The largest urban forest in the world is the Floresta da Pedra Branca (White Rock Forest), which is located in the West Zone of Rio de Janeiro.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.biodiversityreporting.org/index.php?pageId=sub&amp;lang=pt_BR&amp;currentItem=article&amp;docId=18381&amp;c=Brasil&amp;cRef=Brazil&amp;year=2006&amp;date=abril%202005 |title=Poluição afeta Pedra Branca |publisher=[[O Globo]]|accessdate=18 July 2007|date=April 2005|language=Portuguese|first=Daniel Ernesto|last=Engelbrecht Ferreira}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Pontifical Catholic University of Rio ([[Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro|Pontifícia Universidade Católica do Rio de Janeiro]] or PUC-Rio), Brazil's top private university, is located at the edge of the forest, in the Gávea district. The 1984 film ''[[Blame It on Rio]]'' was filmed nearby, with the rental house used by the story's characters sitting at the edge of the forest on a mountain overlooking the famous beaches. In 2012, [[CNN]] elected Ipanema the best city beach in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Forgan |first=Duncan |url=http://www.cnngo.com/explorations/life/best-city-beaches-209050?page=0,1 |title=World's best city beaches #2 |publisher=CNNGo.com |date=23 May 2012 |accessdate=31 October 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120901062305/http://www.cnngo.com/explorations/life/best-city-beaches-209050?page=0%2C1 |archivedate=1 September 2012  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Palácio_de_São_Cristóvão.jpg|thumb|left|[[Paço de São Cristóvão|Palace of São Cristóvão]], the former residence of the [[List of monarchs of Brazil|Emperors of Brazil]], was the National Museum of the [[Federal University of Rio de Janeiro]], at [[Quinta da Boa Vista]], located in [[Imperial de São Cristóvão|São Cristóvão]] imperial neighbourhood.]]The North Zone ({{lang|pt|Zona Norte}}) begins at Grande Tijuca (the middle class residential and commercial ''bairro'' of [[Tijuca]]), just west of the city center, and sprawls for miles inland until [[Baixada Fluminense]] and the city's Northwest.

This region is home to the [[Estádio do Maracanã|Maracanã stadium]] (located in Grande Tijuca), once the world's highest capacity [[Association football|football]] venue, able to hold nearly 199,000 people, as it did for the [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] [[Uruguay v Brazil (1950 FIFA World Cup)|final]] of [[1950 FIFA World Cup|1950]]. More recently its capacity has been reduced to conform with modern safety regulations and the stadium has introduced seating for all fans. Currently undergoing reconstruction, it has now the capacity for 90,000; it will eventually hold around 80,000 people. Maracanã was the site for the Opening and Closing Ceremonies and football competition of the [[2007 Pan American Games]]; hosted the [[2014 FIFA World Cup Final|final match]] of the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]], the [[2016 Summer Olympics opening ceremony|Opening]] and [[2016 Summer Olympics closing ceremony|Closing Ceremonies]] and the [[Football at the 2016 Summer Olympics|football matches]] of the [[2016 Summer Olympics]].

Besides Maracanã, the North Zone of Rio also has other tourist and historical attractions, such "Nossa Senhora da Penha de França Church", the [[Christ the Redeemer (statue)]] with its stairway built into the rock bed, 'Manguinhos', the home of [[Fundação Oswaldo Cruz|Instituto Oswaldo Cruz]], a centenarian [[biomedicine|biomedical]] [[research institute|research institution]] with a main building fashioned like a [[Moors|Moorish]] palace, and the [[Quinta da Boa Vista]], the park where the historic [[Paço de São Cristóvão|Imperial Palace]] is located. Nowadays, the palace hosts the [[National Museum of Brazil|National Museum]], specialising in Natural History, Archaeology, and Ethnology. The [[Rio de Janeiro–Galeão International Airport|International Airport of Rio de Janeiro]] (Galeão&amp;nbsp;– Antônio Carlos Jobim [[International airport|International Airport]], named after the famous Brazilian musician [[Antônio Carlos Jobim]]), the main campus of the [[Federal University of Rio de Janeiro]] at the Fundão Island, and the [[Rio de Janeiro State University|State University of Rio de Janeiro]], in Maracanã, are also located in the Northern part of Rio.

This region is also home to most of the [[samba school]]s of Rio de Janeiro such as Mangueira, Salgueiro, Império Serrano, Unidos da Tijuca, Imperatriz Leopoldinense, among others. Some of the main neighbourhoods of Rio's North Zone are Alto da Boa Vista which shares the [[Tijuca Forest|Tijuca Rainforest]] with the South and Southwest Zones; Tijuca, Vila Isabel, Méier, [[São Cristóvão (Rio de Janeiro neighborhood)|São Cristovão]], Madureira, Penha, Manguinhos, Fundão, Olaria among others. Many of Rio de Janeiro's roughly 1000 [[slums]], or [[favelas]], are located in the North Zone.&lt;ref&gt;"Reinventing Rio"[http://www.smithsonianmag.com/travel/Reinventing-Rio.html], Alan Riding, September 2010, ''Smithsonian''&lt;/ref&gt;  The favelas resemble the slums of [[Paris]], [[New York City|New York]] or other major cities in the 19th and early 20th centuries in the United States and Europe, or similar neighborhoods in present underdeveloped countries.

===West Zone===

West Zone (''Zona Oeste'') of Rio de Janeiro is a complicated place that makes up more than 50% of the city area, including Barra da Tijuca and Recreio dos Bandeirantes neighborhoods. The West Side of Rio has many historic sites because of the old "Royal Road of Santa Cruz" that crossed the territory in the regions of Realengo, Bangu, and Campo Grande, finishing at the Royal Palace of Santa Cruz in the Santa Cruz region. The highest peak of the city of Rio de Janeiro is the Pedra Branca Peak (Pico da Pedra Branca) inside the [[Pedra Branca State Park]]. It has an altitude of 1024m. The Pedra Branca State Park (Parque Estadual da Pedra Branca)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Inea – Portal|url = http://www.inea.rj.gov.br/Portal/Agendas/BIODIVERSIDADEEAREASPROTEGIDAS/UnidadesdeConservacao/INEA_008594|website = www.inea.rj.gov.br|accessdate = 25 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the biggest urban state park in the world comprising 17 neighborhoods in the west side, being a "giant lung" in the city with trails,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.inea.rj.gov.br/cs/idcplg?IdcService=GET_FILE&amp;dID=13669&amp;dDocName=PRODUCAO_PORTAL011861|title = [PDF] Trail Guide of Pedra Branca State|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; waterfalls and historic constructions like an old aqueduct in the Colônia Juliano Moreira&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://museubispodorosario.com|title = Bispo do Rosário Museum, the contemporary museum of Colônia|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; in the neighborhood of [[Taquara, Rio de Janeiro|Taquara]] and a dam in [[Camorim]]. The park has three principal entrances: the main one is in Taquara called Pau da Fome Core, another entrance is the Piraquara Core in [[Realengo]] and the last one is the Camorim Core, considered the cultural heritage of the city.

Santa Cruz and Campo Grande Region have exhibited economic growth, mainly in the [[Campo Grande, Rio de Janeiro|Campo Grande neighborhood]]. Industrial enterprises are being built in lower and lower middle class residential [[Santa Cruz, Rio de Janeiro|Santa Cruz]], one of the largest and most populous of Rio de Janeiro's neighbourhoods, most notably Companhia Siderúrgica do Atlântico (CSA), a new steel mill with its own private docks on Sepetiba Bay, which is planned to be South America's largest steel works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alerj.rj.gov.br/common/noticia_corpo.asp?num=11187 |title=SIDERÚRGICA DO ATLÂNTICO VAI GERAR 18 MIL EMPREGOS NA ZONA OESTE |publisher= |accessdate=14 May 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160112104626/http://www.alerj.rj.gov.br/common/noticia_corpo.asp?num=11187 |archivedate=12 January 2016  }}&lt;/ref&gt; A tunnel called ''Túnel da Grota Funda'', opened in 2012, creating a [[public transit]] facility between Barra da Tijuca and Santa Cruz, lessening travel time to the region from other areas of Rio de Janeiro.&lt;ref name="VejaRio2011"&gt;{{cite web|title=Topo do blog Quais serão os novos ares cariocas?|url=http://vejario.abril.com.br/blog/as-ruas-do-rio/tags/tunel-da-grota-funda|website=Veja Rio|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140709100044/http://vejario.abril.com.br/blog/as-ruas-do-rio/tags/tunel-da-grota-funda|archivedate=9 July 2014|language=Portuguese|date=19 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Barra da Tijuca region===
[[File:Praia da Barra e Montanhas do Parque Nacional da Tijuca.jpg|thumb|left|[[Barra da Tijuca]] with [[Pedra da Gávea]] at background]]
This is an elite area of the West Zone of the city of Rio de Janeiro. It includes [[Barra da Tijuca]], [[Recreio dos Bandeirantes]], Vargem Grande, Vargem Pequena, [[Grumari]], [[Itanhangá, Rio de Janeiro|Itanhangá]], Camorim and [[Joá]]. Westwards from the older zones of Rio, Barra da Tijuca is a flat complex of barrier islands of formerly undeveloped coastal land, which constantly experiences new constructions and developments. It remains an area of accelerated growth, attracting some of the richer sectors of the population as well as luxury companies. [[Tower block|High rise]] flats and sprawling shopping centers give the area a far more [[Modernism|modern]] feel than the crowded city centre.

The urban planning of the area, completed in the late 1960s, mixes zones of single-family houses with residential skyscrapers. The beaches of Barra da Tijuca are also popular with the residents from other parts of the city. One of the most famous hills in the city is the {{convert|842|m|ft|0|abbr=off|adj=mid|-high}} [[Pedra da Gávea]] ([[Crow's nest]] Rock) bordering the South Zone. On the top of its summit is a huge rock formation (some, such as [[Erich von Däniken]] in his 1973 book, ''In Search of Ancient Gods'', claim it to be a sculpture) resembling a sphinx-like, bearded head that is visible for many kilometres around.

According to the [[Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics|2010 IBGE Census]], there were 5,940,224 people residing in the city of Rio de Janeiro.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.censo2010.ibge.gov.br/dados_divulgados/index.php?uf=33 2010 IGBE Census] {{pt icon}} {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120514145821/http://www.censo2010.ibge.gov.br/dados_divulgados/index.php?uf=33 |date=14 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The census revealed the following numbers: 3,239,888 [[White Brazilian|White]] people (51.2%), 2,318,675 [[Pardo]] ([[Multiracial#Brazil|multiracial]]) people (36.5%), 708,148 [[Afro-Brazilian|Black]] people (11.5%), 45,913 [[Asian Brazilian|Asian]] people (0.7%), 5,981 [[Indigenous peoples in Brazil|Amerindian]] people (0.1%).&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;[http://www.censo2010.ibge.gov.br/painel/?nivel=mn 2010 IGBE Census] {{pt icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The population of Rio de Janeiro was 53.2% [[female]] and 46.8% [[male]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated3/&gt;

In 2010, the city of Rio de Janeiro was the 2nd most populous city in Brazil, after [[São Paulo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{pt icon}} [http://noticias.uol.com.br/cotidiano/2010/11/04/maiores-cidades-do-brasil-crescem-menos-do-que-resto-do-pais-aponta-censo.jhtm The largest Brazilian cities – 2010 IBGE Census]&lt;/ref&gt;

Different ethnic groups contributed to the formation of the population of Rio de Janeiro. Before European colonization, there were at least seven different [[Indigenous peoples in Brazil|indigenous peoples]] speaking 20 languages in the region. A part of them joined the Portuguese and the other the French. Those who joined the [[French Brazilian|French]] were then exterminated by the Portuguese, while the other part was assimilated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://paginas.terra.com.br/educacao/Ludimila/indiosrj.htm |title=Tem índio no Rio |publisher=Paginas.terra.com.br |accessdate=6 May 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070813071626/http://paginas.terra.com.br/educacao/Ludimila/indiosrj.htm |archivedate=13 August 2007 |deadurl=yes  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rio de Janeiro is home to the largest [[Portuguese Brazilian|Portuguese]] population outside of [[Lisbon]] in Portugal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.presidencia.pt/brasil2008/?idc=166&amp;idi=13879 |title=Portuguese descent in the city of Rio de janeiro and Brazil |publisher=Presidencia.pt |accessdate=17 April 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511143624/http://www.presidencia.pt/brasil2008/?idc=166&amp;idi=13879 |archivedate=11 May 2011  }}&lt;/ref&gt; After independence from Portugal, Rio de Janeiro became a destination for hundreds of thousands of immigrants from Portugal, mainly in the early 20th century. The immigrants were mostly poor peasants who subsequently found prosperity in Rio as city workers and small traders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.ibge.gov.br/brasil500/portugueses.html |title=Brasil 500 anos |publisher=.ibge.gov.br |accessdate=6 May 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080523211354/http://www1.ibge.gov.br/brasil500/portugueses.html |archivedate=23 May 2008 |deadurl=yes  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Portuguese cultural influence is still seen in many parts of the city (and many other parts of the state of Rio de Janeiro), including architecture and [[Portuguese language|language]]. Most Brazilians with some cultural contact with Rio know how to easily differentiate between the local dialect, ''fluminense'', and other Brazilian dialects.

[[File:Afot3602.jpg|thumb|right|Portuguese immigrant in Rio de Janeiro.]]

People of [[Portuguese Brazilian|Portuguese]] ancestry predominate in most of the state. The Brazilian census of 1920 showed that 39.7% of the Portuguese who lived in Brazil lived in Rio de Janeiro. Including all of the Rio de Janeiro, the proportion raised to 46.3% of the Portuguese who lived in Brazil. The numerical presence of the Portuguese was extremely high, accounting for 72% of the foreigners who lived in the capital. Portuguese born people accounted for 20.4% of the population of Rio, and those with a Portuguese father or a Portuguese mother accounted for 30.8%. In other words, native born Portuguese and their children accounted for 51.2% of the inhabitants of Rio, or a total of 267,664 people in 1890.&lt;ref&gt;{{Google books |id=QPDe42CBSeMC |page=107 |title=Os lusíadas na aventura do Rio moderno }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Afro-Brazilian|black community]] was formed by residents whose ancestors had been brought as slaves, mostly from [[Angola]] and [[Mozambique]], as well by people of Angolan, Mozambican and [[West African]] descent who moved to Rio from other parts of Brazil. The samba (from Bahia with Angolan influence) and the famous local version of the carnival (from Europe) first appeared under the influence of the black community in the city.

Today, nearly half of the city's population is by phenotype perceptibly black or part black,.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.ibge.gov.br/brasil500/negros/origem.html |title=Brasil 500 anos |publisher=.ibge.gov.br |accessdate=6 May 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080518220742/http://www1.ibge.gov.br/brasil500/negros/origem.html |archivedate=18 May 2008 |deadurl=yes  }}&lt;/ref&gt; A large majority has some recent Subsaharan ancestor.

[[Pardo]], for example, in popular usage includes those who are ''[[caboclo]]s'' ([[mestizo]]s), ''mulatos'' ([[mulattoes]]), ''[[cafuzo]]s'' ([[zambo]]s), ''juçaras'' (archaic term for [[multiracial#Brazil|tri-racials]]) and westernized [[Indigenous peoples of Brazil|Amerindians]] (which are called ''caboclos'' as well), being more of a skin color rather than a racial group in particular.

As a result of the influx of immigrants to Brazil from the late 19th to the early 20th century, also found in Rio de Janeiro and [[Greater Rio de Janeiro|its metropolitan area]] are communities of [[Arab Brazilian|Levantine Arabs]] who are mostly [[Arab Christians|Christian]] or [[Irreligion in Brazil|Irreligious]], [[Spanish immigration to Brazil|Spaniards]], [[Italian Brazilian|Italians]], [[German Brazilian|Germans]], [[Japanese Brazilians|Japanese]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Agencia Brasil |url=http://agenciabrasil.ebc.com.br/noticia/2011-03-11/consulado-do-japao-no-rio-disponibiliza-telefone-para-prestar-informacoes-sobre-pais |title=Consulado do Japão no Rio disponibiliza telefone para prestar informações sobre o país &amp;#124; Agencia Brasil |publisher=Agenciabrasil.ebc.com.br |date=11 March 2011 |accessdate=15 September 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120509220521/http://agenciabrasil.ebc.com.br/noticia/2011-03-11/consulado-do-japao-no-rio-disponibiliza-telefone-para-prestar-informacoes-sobre-pais |archivedate= 9 May 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[History of the Jews in Brazil|Jews]], and people from other parts of Brazil.

According to an autosomal DNA study from 2009, conducted on a school in the poor suburb of Rio de Janeiro, the "pardos" there were found to be on average about 80% European, and the "whites" (who thought of themselves as "very mixed") were found to carry very little Amerindian and/or African admixtures. The results of the tests of genomic ancestry are quite different from the self made estimates of European ancestry. In general, the test results showed that European ancestry is far more important than the students thought it would be. The "pardos" for example thought of themselves as ⅓ European, ⅓ African and ⅓ Amerindian before the tests, and yet their ancestry on average reached 80% European.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.meionews.com.br/index.php/noticias/21-estado-do-rio/4607-negros-e-pardos-do-rio-tem-mais-genes-europeus-do-que-imaginam-segundo-estudo.html |title=Negros e pardos do Rio têm mais genes europeus do que imaginam, segundo estudo |publisher=Meionews.com.br |date= |accessdate=15 September 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706153557/http://www.meionews.com.br/index.php/noticias/21-estado-do-rio/4607-negros-e-pardos-do-rio-tem-mais-genes-europeus-do-que-imaginam-segundo-estudo.html |archivedate=6 July 2011  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www4.ensp.fiocruz.br/informe/anexos/ric.pdf |title=Ensp.fiocruz.br/informe/anexos/ric.pdf|accessdate=23 August 2011 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other studies showed similar results&lt;ref name="laboratoriogene.info"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc = 3885524 | pmid=24416183 | doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0083926 | volume=9 | issue=1 | title=Association of genetic variants with self-assessed color categories in Brazilians | year=2014 | journal=PLoS ONE | pages=e83926 | last1 = Durso | first1 = DF | last2 = Bydlowski | first2 = SP | last3 = Hutz | first3 = MH | last4 = Suarez-Kurtz | first4 = G | last5 = Magalhães | first5 = TR | last6 = Pena | first6 = SD| bibcode=2014PLoSO...983926D }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Rio de Janeiro metropolitan area, according to 2009 research from [[Fundação Getúlio Vargas]] (known as {{lang|pt|Novo Mapa das Religiões}}), ranks first in Brazil in the percentage of [[Catholic]]s (51.1%) living there. Rio de Janeiro city also ranks fifth among Brazilian state capital cities in the percentage of its population that is irreligious (13.3%), barely changing since 2000 (the first-ranked, Boa Vista, has 21.2% irreligious).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.paulopes.com.br/2011/08/roraima-lidera-o-ranking-dos-sem.html Roraima heads in Irreligion percentage ranking, Rio de Janeiro state is in #2] Data from [[Fundação Getúlio Vargas]]. {{pt icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://diariodeteresina.com.br/noticias/piaui-e-o-estado-mais-catolico-do-brasil-apesar-do-crescimento-dos-evangelicos.html Piauí is the most Roman Catholic state in Brazil despite growth in Evangelicals, Pentecostals and other Protestants] Data from FGV. {{pt icon}}  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130508123651/http://diariodeteresina.com.br/noticias/piaui-e-o-estado-mais-catolico-do-brasil-apesar-do-crescimento-dos-evangelicos.html |date=8 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also the Brazilian state capital with the greatest percentage of [[Spiritism|Spiritists]] (now about 4–5%), and with substantial numbers in [[Afro-Brazilian religions]] and [[Eastern religions]].

There are significant disparities between the rich and the poor in Rio de Janeiro, and different socioeconomic groups are largely segregated into different neighborhoods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ikoporan.org/1_1_contexto_rio_eng.asp|title=Iko Poran|date=5 January 2004|website=archive.org|accessdate=11 October 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040105122004/http://www.ikoporan.org/1_1_contexto_rio_eng.asp|archivedate=5 January 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the city clearly ranks among the world's major metropolises, large numbers live in slums known as [[favela]]s, where 95% of the population are poor, compared to 40% in the general population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://revistaepoca.globo.com/Revista/Epoca/0,,EMI167577-15223,00.html |title=FGV: desigualdade entre favela e asfalto cai no Rio |publisher=Revistaepoca.globo.com |date=31 August 2010 |accessdate=16 October 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101009065937/http://revistaepoca.globo.com/Revista/Epoca/0%2C%2CEMI167577-15223%2C00.html |archivedate=9 October 2010  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been a number of government initiatives to counter this problem, from the removal of the population from favelas to [[Public housing|housing projects]] such as [[Cidade de Deus (Rio de Janeiro)|Cidade de Deus]] to the more recent approach of improving conditions in the favelas and bringing them up to par with the rest of the city, as was the focus of the "Favela Bairro" program and deployment of [[Pacifying Police Unit]]s.

Rio has more people living in slums than any other city in Brazil, according to the 2010 Census.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://oglobo.globo.com/brasil/rio-a-cidade-com-maior-populacao-em-favelas-do-brasil-3489272|title=Rio é a cidade com maior população em favelas do Brasil|date=21 December 2011|work=O Globo|access-date=4 August 2017|language=pt-BR}}&lt;/ref&gt; More than 1,500,000 people live in its 763 favelas, 22% of Rio's total population. [[São Paulo]], the largest city in Brazil, has more favelas (1,020) in sheer numbers, but proportionally has fewer people living in favelas than Rio.

Rio de Janeiro has the second largest [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] of any city in Brazil, surpassed only by [[São Paulo]]. According to the [[Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics|IBGE]], it was approximately US$201&amp;nbsp;billion in 2008, equivalent to 5.1% of the national total. Taking into consideration the network of influence exerted by the urban [[metropolis]] (which covers 11.3% of the population), this share in GDP rises to 14.4%, according to a study released in October 2008 by the IBGE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibge.gov.br/home/presidencia/noticias/29092003estatisticasecxxhtml.shtm |title=History of economy |publisher=Ibge.gov.br |accessdate=17 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Greater Rio de Janeiro, as perceived by the IBGE, has a GDP of US$187&amp;nbsp;billion, constituting the second largest hub of national wealth. Per capita GDP is US$11,786.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Economist|title=Comparing Brazilian states with countries|url=http://www.economist.com/content/compare-cabana|work=Magazine|publisher=Economist|accessdate=3 October 2012|date=30 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It concentrates 68% of the state's economic strength and 7.9% of all goods and services produced in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.protectedplanet.net/sites/478446 |title=Cidade – Protected Planet |publisher= |accessdate=14 May 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150205003206/http://www.protectedplanet.net/sites/478446 |archivedate= 5 February 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The services sector comprises the largest portion of GDP (65.5%), followed by commerce (23.4%), industrial activities (11.1%) and agriculture (0.1%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gold.dreab.com/p-Rio_de_Janeiro_%28city%29 |title=Rio de Janeiro %28city%29 |publisher=Gold.dreab.com |date= |accessdate=12 March 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426001752/http://gold.dreab.com/p-Rio_de_Janeiro_%28city%29 |archivedate=26 April 2012  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bcg.com/about_bcg/offices/rio_de_janeiro.aspx|title=About BCG – Rio de Janeiro|publisher=|accessdate=14 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Benefiting from the federal capital position it had for a long period (1763–1960), the city became a dynamic administrative, financial, commercial and cultural center. Rio de Janeiro became an attractive place for companies to locate when it was the capital of Brazil, as important sectors of society and of the government were present in the city, even when their factories were located in other cities or states. The city was chosen as headquarters for [[Public property|state-owned]] companies such as [[Petrobras]], [[Eletrobras]], [[Caixa Econômica Federal]], [[Brazilian Development Bank|National Economic and Social Development Bank]] and [[Vale (mining company)|Vale]] (which was privatized in the 1990s). The [[Rio de Janeiro Stock Exchange]] (BVRJ), which currently trades only government securities, was the first stock exchange founded in Brazil in 1845. Despite the transfer of the capital to [[Brasília]] in 1960, many of these headquarters remained within the Rio metropolitan area.

The off-shore oil exploration in the [[Campos Basin]] began in 1968 and became the main site for oil production of Brazil. This caused many oil and gas companies to be based in Rio de Janeiro, such as the Brazilian branches of [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]], [[EBX Group|EBX]] and [[Esso]]. For many years Rio was the second largest industrial hub of Brazil,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sidra.ibge.gov.br/bda/tabela/listabl.asp?z=cd&amp;o=17&amp;i=P&amp;c=793 |title=IBGE – Economy of Rio de Janeiro |publisher=Sidra.ibge.gov.br |accessdate=17 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; with [[oil refineries]], shipbuilding industries, steel, [[metallurgy]], petrochemicals, cement, [[pharmaceutic]]al, textile, processed foods and furniture industries.

Major international pharmaceutical companies have their Brazilian headquarters in Rio such as: [[Merck KGaA|Merck]], [[Roche Applied Science|Roche]], Arrow, Darrow, [[Baxter International|Baxter]], Mayne, and Mappel. A newer electronics and computer sector has been added to the more-established industries. Construction, also an important activity, provides a significant source of employment for large numbers of unskilled workers and is buoyed by the number of seasonal residents who build second homes in the Greater Rio de Janeiro area.

Rio is an important financial centre, second only to São Paulo in volume of business. Its securities market, although declining in significance relative to São Paulo, is still of major importance. Recent decades have seen a sharp transformation in its economic profile, which is becoming more and more one of a major national hub of services and businesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.barra-brazilbeach.com/about_us/Economy_Of_Rio_de_Janeiro.html|title=Economy Of Rio de Janeiro, need To Know Economy Of Rio de Janeiro, About Economy Of Rio de Janeiro|publisher=|accessdate=14 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city is the headquarters of large telecom companies, such as [[Intelig Telecom|Intelig]], [[Oi (telecommunications)|Oi]] and [[Embratel]]. Major Brazilian entertainment and media organizations are based in Rio de Janeiro like [[Organizações Globo]] and also some of Brazil's major newspapers: ''[[Jornal do Brasil]]'', ''[[O Dia]]'', and ''Business Rio''.

Tourism and entertainment are other key aspects of the city's economic life. The city is the nation's top tourist attraction for both Brazilians and foreigners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.portalemfoco.com.br/artigos.php?pag=artigo&amp;artigoid=150 |title=Tourism in Rio |publisher=Portalemfoco.com.br |accessdate=17 April 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706153936/http://www.portalemfoco.com.br/artigos.php?pag=artigo&amp;artigoid=150 |archivedate=6 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

To attract industry, the [[Rio de Janeiro (state)|state government]] has designated certain areas on the outskirts of the city as industrial districts where infrastructure is provided and land sales are made under special conditions. Oil and natural gas from fields off the northern coast of Rio de Janeiro state are a major asset used for developing manufacturing activities in Rio's metropolitan area, enabling it to compete with other major cities for new investment in industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://agricultura.ruralbr.com.br/noticia/2010/09/rio-de-janeiro-sera-a-capital-do-petroleo-entre-os-dias-13-e-16-de-setembro-3035609.html |title=Rio de Janeiro será a capital do petróleo entre os dias 13 e 16 de setembro – Agricultura &amp;#124;RuralBR |publisher=Agricultura.ruralbr.com.br |date= |accessdate=12 March 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105160734/http://agricultura.ruralbr.com.br/noticia/2010/09/rio-de-janeiro-sera-a-capital-do-petroleo-entre-os-dias-13-e-16-de-setembro-3035609.html |archivedate= 5 November 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Owing to the proximity of Rio's port facilities, many of Brazil's export-import companies are headquartered in the city. In Greater Rio, which has one of the highest per capita incomes in Brazil, retail trade is substantial. Many of the most important retail stores are located in the Centre, but others are scattered throughout the commercial areas of the other districts, where shopping centres, supermarkets, and other retail businesses handle a large volume of consumer trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/504192/Rio-de-Janeiro/29045/Climate# |title=Economy of Rio |publisher=Britannica.com |accessdate=17 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Tourism in Brazil}}
Rio de Janeiro is Brazil's primary tourist attraction and resort. It receives the most visitors per year of any city in South America with 2.82&amp;nbsp;million international tourists a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rio2016.com/en/news/rio-de-janeiro-is-the-main-tourist-destination-in-the-south-hemisphere |title=Rio de Janeiro is the main tourist destination in the South Hemisphere |date=29 January 2010 |accessdate=11 February 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151118174506/http://www.rio2016.com/en/news/rio-de-janeiro-is-the-main-tourist-destination-in-the-south-hemisphere |archivedate=18 November 2015  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city world-class hotels, approximately 80&amp;nbsp;kilometres of beaches and the famous [[Corcovado]] and [[Sugarloaf Mountain (Brazil)|Sugarloaf]] mountains. While the city had in past had a thriving tourism sector, the industry entered a decline in the last quarter of the 20th century. Annual international airport arrivals dropped from 621,000 to 378,000 and average hotel occupancy dropped to 50% between 1985 and 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.touristlink.com.br/Brasil/rio-de-janeiro/overview.html|title=Rio de Janeiro|author=Flickr roger4336|work=TouristLink|accessdate=14 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fact that [[Brasília]] replaced Rio de Janeiro as the Brazilian capital in 1960 and that [[São Paulo]] replaced Rio as the country's commercial, financial and main cultural center during the mid-20th century, has also been cited as a leading cause of the decline.&lt;ref name="Worldwide destinations"/&gt;

Rio de Janeiro's government has since undertaken to modernise the city's economy, reduce its chronic social inequalities, and improve its commercial standing as part of an initiative for the regeneration of the tourism industry.&lt;ref name="Worldwide destinations"&gt;{{cite book|title=Worldwide destinations casebook: the geography of travel and tourism|first1=Brian G.|last1=Boniface|first2=Christopher P.|last2=Cooper|publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann|year=2005|isbn=0-7506-6440-1|pages=233–35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Educational system===
Primary schools are largely under municipal administration, while the state plays a more significant role in the extensive network of secondary schools. There are also a small number of schools under federal administration, as is the case of Pedro II School, Colégio de Aplicação da UFRJ and the Centro Federal de Educação Tecnológica of Rio de Janeiro (CEFET-RJ). In addition, Rio has an ample offering of private schools that provide education at all levels. Rio is home to many colleges and universities.  The literacy rate for [[carioca]]s aged 10 and older is nearly 95 percent, well above the national average.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://student.britannica.com/comptons/article-229648/Rio-de-Janeiro |title=Education in Rio |publisher=Student.britannica.com |accessdate=17 April 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120717214855/http://student.britannica.com/comptons/article-229648/Rio-de-Janeiro |archivedate=17 July 2012  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture ==
[[File:MAM - Museu de Arte Moderna do Rio de Janeiro 02.jpg|thumb|left|[[Museum of Modern Art, Rio de Janeiro|Museum of Modern Art]]]]
Rio de Janeiro is a main cultural hub in Brazil. Its architecture embraces churches and buildings dating from the 16th to the 19th centuries, blending with the world-renowned designs of the 20th century. Rio was home to the [[Portugal|Portuguese Imperial family]] and capital of the country for many years, and was influenced by [[Architecture of Portugal|Portuguese]], [[Architecture of England|English]], and [[French architecture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fbnsummit.org/2013/brazil-and-the-city-of-rio/|title=FBN Summit|publisher=|accessdate=14 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rio de Janeiro has inherited a strong cultural role from the past. In the late 19th century, there were sessions held of the first Brazilian film and since then, several production cycles have spread out, eventually placing Rio at the forefront of experimental and national cinema. The [[Rio de Janeiro International Film Festival]]&lt;ref&gt;festivaldorio.com.br&lt;/ref&gt; has been held annually since 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/event/ev0001488/overview|title=Rio de Janeiro International Film Festival|publisher=|accessdate=14 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rio currently brings together the main production centers of Brazilian television.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theoilcommunity.com/?cp=locTopic&amp;op=categoryData&amp;ly=loc&amp;li=92&amp;ti=19 |title=Coming Soon page |publisher= |accessdate=14 May 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403092715/http://www.theoilcommunity.com/?cp=locTopic&amp;op=categoryData&amp;ly=loc&amp;li=92&amp;ti=19 |archivedate= 3 April 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Major international films set in Rio de Janeiro include ''[[Blame it on Rio]]''; the [[James Bond in film|James Bond film]] [[Moonraker (film)|''Moonraker'']]; the Oscar award-winning, critically acclaimed ''[[Central Station (film)|Central Station]]'' by [[Walter Salles]], who is also one of Brazil's best-known directors; and the Oscar award-winning historical drama, ''[[Black Orpheus]]'', which depicted the early days of Carnaval in Rio de Janeiro. Internationally famous, Brazilian-made movies illustrating a darker side of Rio de Janeiro include ''[[Elite Squad]]'' and [[City of God (2002 film)|''City of God'']].
[[File:Esculturas, Museu Nacional de Belas Artes 02.jpg|thumb|[[Museu Nacional de Belas Artes|National Museum of Fine Arts]]]]

Rio has many important cultural landmarks, such as the Biblioteca Nacional (National Library), one of the largest libraries in the world with collections totalling more than 9 million items; the [[Teatro Municipal (Rio de Janeiro)|Theatro Municipal]]; the [[Museu Nacional de Belas Artes|National Museum of Fine Arts]]; the [[Carmen Miranda Museum]]; the [[Rio de Janeiro Botanical Garden]]; the [[Parque Lage]]; the [[Quinta da Boa Vista]]; the [[Paço Imperial|Imperial Square]]; the [[Academia Brasileira de Letras|Brazilian Academy of Letters]]; the [[Museum of Modern Art, Rio de Janeiro|Museu de Arte Moderna do Rio de Janeiro]]; and the [[National Museum of Brazil|Natural History Museum]].

===Literature===
{{Main|Literature of Brazil}}
After Brazilian independence from Portugal in 1822, Rio de Janeiro quickly developed a [[Culture of Europe|European-style]] bourgeois cultural life, including numerous newspapers, in which most 19th-century novels were initially published in serial. [[Joaquim Manuel de Macedo]]'s ''[[A Moreninha]]'' (1844) was perhaps the first successful novel in Brazil and inaugurates a recurrent 19th-century theme: a romantic relationship between idealistic young people in spite of cruelties of social fortune.
[[File:Academia brasileira de letras 2.JPG|thumb|left|[[Academia Brasileira de Letras|Brazilian Academy of Letters]]]]

The first notable work of realism focusing on the urban [[lower middle class|lower-middle class]] is [[Manuel Antônio de Almeida]]'s ''[[Memórias de um sargento de milícias]]'' (1854), which presents a series of picaresque but touching scenes, and evokes the transformation of a town into a city with suggestive nostalgia. Romantic and realist modes both flourished through the late 19th century and often overlapped within works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Piers Armstrong |url=http://cco.cambridge.org/extract?id=ccol0521825334_CCOL0521825334A008 |title=Rio's novel history |publisher=Cco.cambridge.org |accessdate=17 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most famous author of Rio de Janeiro, however, was [[Machado de Assis]], who is also widely regarded as the greatest writer of [[Brazilian literature]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Antonio Candido|Candido; Antonio.]] (1970) ''Vários escritos.'' São Paulo: Duas Cidades. p.18.&lt;/ref&gt; and considered the founder of [[Realism (arts)|Realism]] in Brazil, with the publication of ''[[The Posthumous Memoirs of Bras Cubas]]'' (1881).&lt;ref&gt;Faraco, Carlos Emílio e Moura, Francisco Mato. ''Português Projetos''. São Paulo: Editora Ática, 2009, p.227.&lt;/ref&gt; He commented on and criticized the political and social events of the city and country such as the abolition of slavery in 1888 and the transition from [[Empire of Brazil|Empire]] to Republic with his numerous [[chronicle]]s published in newspapers of the time.&lt;ref&gt;Gledson, John. J. ''Machado de Assis, ficção e história''. Rio de Janeiro: Paz e Terra, 1986, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of his short stories and novels, like ''[[Quincas Borba]]'' (1891) and ''[[Dom Casmurro]]'' (1899), are placed in Rio.

The headquarters of the [[Academia Brasileira de Letras|Brazilian Academy of Letters]] is based in Rio de Janeiro. It was satirized by the novelist [[Jorge Amado]] in ''[[Pen, Sword, Camisole]]''. Amado, himself, went on to be one of the 40 members of the Academy.

The Biblioteca Nacional ([[National Library of Brazil]]) ranks as one of the largest libraries in the world. It is also the largest library in all of Latin America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rio-de-janeiro.info/national-library.htm |title=National Library of Rio de Janeiro |publisher=Rio-de-janeiro.info |accessdate=17 April 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100830173312/http://www.rio-de-janeiro.info/national-library.htm |archivedate=30 August 2010  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Located in [[Cinelândia]], the National Library was originally created by the King of Portugal, in 1810. As with many of Rio de Janeiro's cultural monuments, the library was originally off-limits to the general public. The most valuable collections in the library include: 4,300 items donated by Barbosa Machado including a precious collection of rare brochures detailing the [[History of Portugal]] and [[History of Brazil|Brazil]]; 2,365 items from the 17th and 18th centuries that were previously owned by Antônio de Araújo de Azevedo, the "Count of Barca", including the 125-volume set of prints "Le Grand Théâtre de l'Univers;" a collection of documents regarding the Jesuítica Province of Paraguay and the "Region of Prata;" and the Teresa Cristina Maria Collection, donated by [[Pedro II of Brazil|Emperor Pedro II]]. The collection contains 48,236 items. Individual items of special interest include a rare first edition of ''[[Os Lusíadas]]'' by [[Luís de Camões|Luis de Camões]], published in 1584; two copies of the Mogúncia Bible; and a first edition of Handel's Messiah.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bn.br/portal/ |title=Official website – National Library of Rio |publisher=Bn.br |date=25 August 2008 |accessdate=17 April 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100328091608/http://www.bn.br/portal/ |archivedate=28 March 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Real Gabinete Português de Leitura (Portuguese Royal Reading Library) is located at Rua Luís de Camões, in the Centro (Downtown). The institution was founded in 1837 by a group of forty-three [[Portuguese people|Portuguese immigrants]], [[political refugee]]s, to promote culture among the Portuguese community in the then capital of the Empire. The history of the [[Academia Brasileira de Letras|Brazilian Academy of Letters]] is linked to the Real Gabinete, since some of the early meetings of the Academy were held there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://opiniaoenoticia.com.br/cultura/um-pedaco-de-portugal-no-rio-de-janeiro/|title=Um pedaço de Portugal no Rio de Janeiro – Opinião e Notícia|author=|date=28 May 2011|work=opiniaoenoticia.com.br}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music===
[[File:Tom_Jobim_e_Chico_Buarque_no_Festival_Internacional_da_Canção_(FIC).tif|thumb|left|[[Tom Jobim]] and [[Chico Buarque]], leading names of ''[[bossa nova]]''.]]
The official song of Rio de Janeiro is "[[Cidade Maravilhosa]]", which means "marvelous city". The song is considered the civic anthem of Rio, and is always the favourite song during Rio's [[Brazilian Carnival|Carnival]] in February. Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo, are considered the centre of the [[urban contemporary|urban music]] movement in Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;Behague, Gerard. "Rap, Reggae, Rock, or Samba: The Local and the Global in [[Música popular brasileira|Brazilian Popular Music]] (1985–1995)." [[Latin American music|Latin American Music]] Review 27, no. 1 (Spring/Summer 2006): 79–90&lt;/ref&gt;

"Rio was popularised by the hit song "[[The Girl from Ipanema]]", composed by [[Antônio Carlos Jobim]] and [[Vinicius de Moraes]] and recorded by [[Astrud Gilberto]] and [[João Gilberto]], [[Frank Sinatra]], and [[Ella Fitzgerald]]. It is also the main key song of the [[bossa nova]], a [[music genre]] born in Rio. A genre unique to Rio and Brazil as a whole is [[Funk carioca|Funk Carioca]]. While [[samba]] music continues to act as the national unifying agent in Rio, Funk Carioca found a strong community following in Brazil. With its genesis in the 1970s as the modern black pop music from the United States, it evolved in the 1990s to describe a variety of [[electronic music]] associated with the current US [[African-American music|black music]] scene, including [[hip hop]], [[modern soul]], and [[house music]]."&lt;ref&gt;Sansone, Livio. "The Localization of Global Funk in Bahia and Rio." In Brazilian Popular Music &amp; Globalization, 135–60. London: Routledge, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

Brazil's return to democracy in 1985 after over 20&amp;nbsp;years of military authoritarian rule, and the subsequent end of rampant censorship, allowed for a new freedom of expression which promoted creativity and experimentation in expressive culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://georgemlima.blogspot.com/2007/09/um-tapinha-di-ou-no-di-censura-na-msica.html |title=Music in the city |publisher=Georgemlima.blogspot.com |date=24 February 2004 |accessdate=17 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commercial and cultural imports from Europe and North America have often influenced Brazil's own cultural output. For example, the hip hop that has stemmed from New York is localized into forms of musical production such as Funk Carioca and [[Brazilian hip hop]]. Bands from Rio de Janeiro also had influence in the mid-to-late development of the [[Punk in Brazil]], and that of [[Brazilian thrash metal]]. Democratic renewal also allowed for the recognition and acceptance of this diversification of Brazilian culture.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Behague | first1 = Gerard | year = 2006 | title = Globalization/Modernization: Rap, Reggae, Rock, or Samba: The Local and the Global in Brazilian Popular Music (1985–1995) | url = | journal = Latin American Music Review | volume = 27 | issue = 1| pages = 79–90 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rio de Janeiro's [[Theatro Municipal (Rio de Janeiro)|Theatro Municipal]] is one of the most attractive buildings in the central area of the city. Home of one of the largest stages in Latin America and one of Brazil's best known venues for opera, ballet, and classical music, the building was inspired by the [[Palais Garnier]], home of the [[Paris Opera]]. Construction of the Theatro Municipal began in 1905 following designs of the architect Francisco Pereira Passos. The statues on the top, of two women representing Poetry and Music, are by Rodolfo Bernardelli, and the interior is rich with furnishings and fine paintings. Inaugurated in 1909, the Teatro Municipal has close to 1,700 seats. Its interior includes turn of the century stained glass from France, ceilings of rose-colored marble and a 1,000&amp;nbsp;pound crystal bead chandelier surrounded by a painting of the "[[Dance of the Hours]]". The exterior walls of the building are dotted with inscriptions bearing the names of famous Brazilians as well as many other international celebrities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rio-de-janeiro.info/teatro-municipal.htm |title=Teatro Municipal do Rio |publisher=Rio-de-janeiro.info |accessdate=17 April 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100406222751/http://www.rio-de-janeiro.info/teatro-municipal.htm |archivedate=6 April 2010  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cidade da Música|Cidade das Artes]] (City of Arts) is a cultural complex in Barra da Tijuca in the Southwest Zone of Rio de Janeiro, which was originally planned to open in 2004. Formally known as "Cidade da Música" (City of Music), it was finally inaugurated at the beginning of 2013.
The project will host the Brazilian Symphony Orchestra becoming a main center for music as will be the largest modern concert hall in South America, with 1,780 seats. The complex spans approximately {{convert|90|e3m2|e6ft2|0|abbr=off}} and also features a chamber music hall, three theaters, and 12 rehearsal rooms. From the terrace there is a panoramic view of the zone. The building was designed by the French architect [[Christian de Portzamparc]] and construction was funded by the city of Rio de Janeiro.

===Events===

====New Year's Eve====
[[File:Rio New Year Fireworks.jpg|thumb|right|New Year's Eve Fireworks at Copacabana Beach]]
Every 31 December, 2.5&amp;nbsp;million people gather at [[Copacabana Beach]] to celebrate New Year's in Rio de Janeiro. The crowd, mostly dressed in white, celebrates all night at the hundreds of different shows and events along the beach. It is the second largest celebration only next to the [[Rio Carnival|Carnival]]. People celebrate the New Year by sharing chilled champagne. It is considered good luck to shake the champagne bottle and spray around at midnight. Chilled champagne adds to the spirit of the festivities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.copacabana.info/new-years-eve.html |title=New Year – Rio |publisher=Copacabana.info |accessdate=17 April 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101229014744/http://www.copacabana.info/new-years-eve.html |archivedate=29 December 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Rock in Rio====

[[File:World Stage Rock in Rio 4.jpg|right|thumb|The World Stage at the "[[Rock in Rio]]" music festival]]
"Rock in Rio" is a music festival conceived by entrepreneur Roberto Medina for the first time in 1985, and since its creation, recognized as the largest music festival in the Latin world and the largest in the world, with 1.5 million people attending the first event, 700,000 attending the second and fourth, about 1.2 million attending the third, and about 350,000 people attending each of the 3 [[Lisbon]] events. It was originally organized in Rio de Janeiro, from where the name comes from, has become a world level event and, in 2004, had its first edition abroad in [[Lisbon]], [[Portugal]], before [[Madrid]], [[Spain]] and [[Las Vegas]], [[United States]]. The festival is considered the eighth best in the world by the specialized site Fling Festival.&lt;ref name=festivalfling&gt;{{cite web|url=http://festivalfling.com/best-music-festivals-2012/ |title=The Top 10 Music Festivals in the World |publisher=Festival Fling |access-date=23 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Carnival====
{{Main|Rio Carnival|Brazilian Carnaval}}
[[File:Banda de Ipanema.jpg|thumb|[[Banda de Ipanema]], one of the largest [[carnival block]]s of the city]]
Carnaval, is an annual celebration in the Roman Catholic tradition that allows merry-making and red meat consumption before the more sober 40&amp;nbsp;days of Lent penance which culminates with Holy or Passion Week and Easter. The tradition of Carnaval parades was probably influenced by the French or German courts and the custom was brought by the Portuguese or Brazilian Imperial families who had Bourbon and Austrian ancestors. Up until the time of the [[marchinha]]s, the revelry was more of a high class and Caucasian-led event. The influence of the African-Brazilian drums and music became more noticeable from the first half of the 20th century. Rio de Janeiro has many Carnaval choices, including the famous [[samba school]] (''Escolas de Samba)''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Between categories, beyond boundaries: Arte, ciudad e identidad|last=Castro Brunetto|first=Carlos Javier|publisher=Libargo|year=2013|isbn=978-84-938812-9-0|location=Granada|pages=112–130|chapter=Arte popular y estética contemporánea en las escuelas de samba de Río de Janeiro}}&lt;/ref&gt; parades in the [[Sambadrome Marquês de Sapucaí|sambadrome]] exhibition center and the popular ''[[Carnival block|blocos de carnaval]]'', street revelry, which parade in almost every corner of the city. The most famous ones are:
* ''Cordão do Bola Preta'': Parades in the centre of the city. It is one of the most traditional carnavals. In 2008, 500,000 people attended in one day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://carnaval.uol.com.br/noticias/riodejaneiro/2008/02/02/ult5681u63.jhtm |title=Cordão do Bola Preta in Rio |publisher=Carnaval.uol.com.br |accessdate=17 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, a record 2 million people attended the city covering three different metro stations.
* ''Suvaco do Cristo'': Band that parades in the [[Jardim Botânico, Rio de Janeiro|Botanic Garden]], directly below the Redeemer statue's arm. The name translates to 'Christ's armpit' in English, and was chosen for that reason.
* ''Carmelitas'': Band that was supposedly created by nuns, but in fact is just a theme chosen by the band. It parades in Santa Teresa, a ''bairro'' from where one can see extensive panoramas.
* ''Simpatia é Quase Amor'': One of the most popular parades in Ipanema. Translates as 'Friendliness is almost love'.
* ''[[Banda de Ipanema]]'': The most traditional in [[Ipanema]]. It attracts a wide range of revellers, including families and a wide spectrum of the [[LGBT]]/[[Queer]] population (notably drag queens).

In 1840, the first Carnaval was celebrated with a masked ball. As years passed, adorned floats and costumed revelers became a tradition among the celebrants. Carnaval is known as a historic root of [[Music of Brazil|Brazilian music]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maria-brazil.org/mpb3.htm |title=Brazilian Music: Roots 3 |publisher=Maria-brazil.org |accessdate=6 May 2009}}{{dead link|date=February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rio de Janeiro was one of the host cities of the [[1950 FIFA World Cup|1950]] and [[2014 FIFA World Cup]]s, for which on both occasions Brazil was the host nation. In 1950, the [[Maracanã Stadium]] hosted 8 matches, including all but one of the host team's matches. The Maracanã was also the location of the infamous tournament-deciding match between [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]] and [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]], where Brazil only needed a draw to win the final group stage and the whole tournament. Brazil ended up losing 2–1 in front of a home crowd of more than 199,000. In 2014, the Maracanã hosted seven matches, including [[2014 FIFA World Cup Final|the final]], where [[Germany national football team|Germany]] beat [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] 1–0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/28181689 |title=Germany 1–0 Argentina |date=13 July 2014 |accessdate=14 July 2014 |publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 October 2009, the [[International Olympic Committee]] selected Rio de Janeiro to host the [[2016 Summer Olympics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/olympics/2009-10-02-rio-2016-olympics_N.htm |title=Rio de Janeiro to host 2016 Olympic Games |work=USA Today |date=2 October 2009|accessdate=2 October 2009 |first=Vicki |last=Michaelis}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rio made their first bid for the [[1936 Summer Olympics]], but lost to Berlin. They later made bids for the [[Bids for the 2004 Summer Olympics|2004]] and [[Bids for the 2012 Summer Olympics|2012]] Games, but failed to become a candidate city both times. Those games were awarded to [[Athens]] and London respectively.&lt;ref name="GB 2"&gt;{{cite web |title=Rio de Janeiro, Brazil |work=Bid city profile and Fact sheet |publisher=GamesBids.com |url=http://www.gamesbids.com/english/bids/rio2016.shtml |accessdate=3 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rio is the first Brazilian and South American city to host the Summer Olympics. Rio de Janeiro also became the first city in the [[Southern Hemisphere|southern hemisphere]] outside of Australia to host the games – [[Melbourne]] in [[1956 Summer Olympics|1956]] and [[Sydney]] in [[2000 Summer Olympics|2000]]. In July 2007, Rio successfully organized and hosted the [[2007 Pan American Games|XV Pan American Games]].

Rio de Janeiro also hosted the [[2011 Military World Games]] from 15–24 July 2011. The 2011 [[Military World Games]] were the largest military sports event ever held in Brazil, with approximately 4,900 athletes from 108 countries competing in 20 sports.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rio2011.com.br/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=242&amp;Itemid=100&amp;lang=en Rio 2011 Military Games Presentation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110825062432/https://www.rio2011.com.br/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=242&amp;Itemid=100&amp;lang=en |date=25 August 2011}} Rio 2011 Official Website. Retrieved 16 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rio de Janeiro hosted the 2016 Olympics and Paralympics. The Olympic Games were held from 5 to 21 August 2016. The Paralympics were held from 7 to 18 September 2016.

===Other sports===

The city has a history as host of major international sports events. The [[Ginásio do Maracanãzinho]] was the host arena for the official [[FIBA Basketball World Championship]] for its [[1954 FIBA World Championship|1954]] and [[1963 FIBA World Championship|1963]] editions. Later, the [[Autódromo Internacional Nelson Piquet|Jacarepaguá]] circuit in Rio de Janeiro was the site for the [[Formula One]] [[Brazilian Grand Prix]] from 1978 to 1989. Rio de Janeiro also hosted the [[Grand Prix motorcycle racing|MotoGP]] [[Brazilian Grand Prix]] from 1995 to 2004 and the [[Champ Car]] event from 1996 to 1999. [[Association of Surfing Professionals|WCT/WQS]] [[surfing]] championships were contested on the beaches from 1985 to 2001. The [[Rio Champions Cup]] Tennis tournament is held in the spring. As part of its preparations to host the [[2007 Pan American Games]], Rio built a new stadium, [[Estádio Olímpico João Havelange]], to hold 45,000 people. It was named after Brazilian ex-[[FIFA]] president [[João Havelange]]. The stadium is owned by the city of Rio de Janeiro, but it was rented to [[Botafogo de Futebol e Regatas]] for 20&amp;nbsp;years.&lt;ref name="rent"&gt;{{cite web|title=Botafogo vai administrar estádio olímpico do Engenhão |url=http://noticias.correioweb.com.br/materias.php?id=2715287&amp;sub=Esporte |accessdate=28 August 2007 |publisher=Correio Web |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071217095517/http://noticias.correioweb.com.br/materias.php?id=2715287&amp;sub=Esporte |archivedate=17 December 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rio de Janeiro has also a multi-purpose arena, the [[HSBC Arena (Rio de Janeiro)|HSBC Arena]].
[[File:Crianças jogando futebol de areia.jpg|thumb|right|Children playing beach football]]

The Brazilian Dance/Sport/[[Martial art]] [[Capoeira]] is very popular. Other popular sports are [[basketball]], [[Beach soccer|beach football]], [[beach volleyball]], Beach American Football, [[footvolley]], [[surfing]], [[kite surfing]], [[hang gliding]], [[motor racing]], [[Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu]], [[Sailing (sport)|sailing]], and competitive [[Rowing (sport)|rowing]]. Another sport that is highly popular in beaches of Rio is called "Frescobol" ({{IPA-pt|fɾe̞ɕko̞ˈbɔw|pron}}), a type of beach tennis. Rio de Janeiro is also paradise for [[Rock climbing|rock climbers]], with hundreds of routes all over the city, ranging from easy boulders to highly technical big wall climbs, all inside the city. The most famous, Rio's granite mountain, the [[Sugarloaf Mountain (Brazil)|Sugar Loaf]] (''Pão de Açúcar''), is an example, with routes from the easy third grade (American 5.4, French 3) to the extremely difficult ninth grade (5.13/8b), up to {{convert|280|m|ft|0|abbr=off}}.

[[Horse racing]] events are held Thursday nights and weekend afternoons at [[Hipódromo da Gávea]]. An impressive place with excellent grass and dirt tracks, it runs the best horses in the nation. Hang gliding in Rio de Janeiro started in the mid-1970s and quickly proved to be well-suited for this town, because of its geography: steep mountains encounter the Atlantic Ocean, which provide excellent take-off locations and great landing zones on the beach.

One of the most popular sea sports in the city is [[yachting]]. The main yacht clubs are in [[Botafogo]] area that extends halfway between [[Copacabana (Rio de Janeiro)|Copacabana]] and the center of town. Though the most exclusive and interesting is probably the Rio Yacht club, where high society makes it a point to congregate. Most yacht clubs are open to members only and gate crashing is not easy. Copacabana is also a great place to do surfing as well as "Arpoador of Ipanema" beach and "Praia dos Bandeirantes". The sea at these beaches is rough and dangerous, the best surfers from Brazil and other sites of the world come to these beaches to prove themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.studylanguages.org/portuguesecourses/brazil/riodejaneiro/riodejaneiro-sports.asp |title=Sports in the city of Rio |publisher=Studylanguages.org |accessdate=17 April 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100511032038/http://studylanguages.org/portuguesecourses/brazil/riodejaneiro/riodejaneiro-sports.asp |archivedate=11 May 2010  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transportation==

===Airports ===
The city of Rio de Janeiro is served by the following airports for use:
[[File:Riodejaneiro_aerea_aeroportogaleao-131756(cut).jpg|right|thumb|[[Rio de Janeiro–Galeão International Airport]]]]
[[File:Santos_Dumont_by_Diego_Baravelli.jpg|thumb|[[Santos Dumont Airport|Rio de Janeiro–Santos Dumont National Airport]]]]

* [[Rio de Janeiro–Galeão International Airport|Galeão–Antônio Carlos Jobim International Airport]]: used for all international and most of the domestic flights. Since August 2004, with the transfer of many flights from Santos-Dumont Airport, Rio de Janeiro International Airport has returned to being the main doorway to the city. Besides linking Rio to the rest of Brazil with domestic flights, Galeão has connections to 19 countries. It has a capacity to handle up to 30&amp;nbsp;million users a year in two passenger terminals. It is located {{convert|20|km|mi|abbr=on}} from downtown Rio. The airport complex also has Brazil's longest runway at {{convert|4000|m|2|abbr=on}}, and one of South America's largest cargo logistics terminals. The airport is connected to the express bus service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infraero.gov.br/usa/aero_prev_home.php?ai=213 |title=International Airport of Rio de Janeiro |publisher=Infraero |accessdate=17 April 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080423091928/http://www.infraero.gov.br/usa/aero_prev_home.php?ai=213 |archivedate=23 April 2008 |deadurl=yes  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Santos Dumont Airport]]: used mainly by the services to [[São Paulo]], some short and medium-haul domestic flights, and general aviation. Located on [[Guanabara Bay]] just a few blocks from the heart of downtown Rio, during the 1990s Santos-Dumont began to outgrow its capacity, besides diverging from its specialization on short-hop flights, offering routes to other destinations in Brazil. For this reason, in late 2004 Santos-Dumont returned to its original condition of operating only shuttle flights to and from [[Congonhas-São Paulo Airport|Congonhas Airport]] in São Paulo, along with regional aviation. The passenger terminal has undergone extensive renovation and expansion, which increased its capacity to 9,9&amp;nbsp;million users a year. The airport is connected to the city light rail system ([[Rio de Janeiro Light Rail]]), which connects several transport systems to downtown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infraero.gov.br/usa/aero_prev_home.php?ai=212 |title=National Airport of Rio de Janeiro |publisher=Infraero |accessdate=17 April 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080521200151/http://www.infraero.gov.br/usa/aero_prev_home.php?ai=212 |archivedate=21 May 2008 |deadurl=yes  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Jacarepaguá Airport|Jacarepaguá-Roberto Marinho Airport]]: used by general aviation and home to the Aeroclube do Brasil (Brasil [[Flying club]]). The airport is located in the district of Baixada de Jacarepaguá, within the municipality of Rio de Janeiro approximately {{convert|30|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the city center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infraero.gov.br/usa/aero_prev_home.php?ai=214 |title=Jacarepaguá Airport |publisher=Infraero |accessdate=17 April 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090706115512/http://www.infraero.gov.br/usa/aero_prev_home.php?ai=214 |archivedate=6 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Military airports include:
* [[Galeão Air Force Base]]: A [[Brazilian Air Force]] airbase, sharing some facilities with Galeão&amp;nbsp;- Antônio Carlos Jobim International Airport;
* [[Santa Cruz Air Force Base]]: A Brazilian Air Force airbase. Formerly called [[Bartolomeu de Gusmão Airport]], it was built by the [[Luftschiffbau Zeppelin]]. Today it is one of the most important Air Force Bases in Brazil;
* [[Afonsos Air Force Base]]: One of the historical Brazilian Air Force airbases. It is also the location of the University of the Air Force (Universidade da Força Aérea),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unifa.aer.mil.br/|title=UNIFA – Página inicial|website=www.unifa.aer.mil.br|accessdate=11 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Museu Aeroespacial]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musal.aer.mil.br/|title=MUSEU AEROESPACIAL|publisher=|accessdate=14 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and where air shows take place.

=== Ports ===
[[File:Cruise_Ship_Costa_Serena_docked_in_Rio_de_Janeiro_(city)_-_Feb._2011.jpg|thumb|left|[[Port of Rio de Janeiro]]]]

The [[Port of Rio de Janeiro]] is Brazil's third busiest port in terms of cargo volume, and it is the center for cruise vessels. Located on the west coast of the [[Guanabara Bay]], it serves the States of Rio de Janeiro, [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo]], Minas Gerais, and [[Espírito Santo]]. The port is managed by Companhia Docas de Rio de Janeiro. The Port of Rio de Janeiro covers territory from the Mauá Pier in the east to the Wharf of the Cashew in the north. The Port of Rio de Janeiro contains almost {{convert|7|e3m|e3ft|spell=in|abbr=off}} of continuous wharf and an {{convert|883|m|ft|adj=mid|abbr=off}} pier. The Companhia Docas de Rio de Janeiro administers directly the Wharf of the Gamboa general [[Container terminal|cargo terminal]]; the wheat terminal with two warehouses capable of moving 300 tons of grains; General Load Terminal 2 with warehouses covering over {{convert|20|e3m2|e3ft2|0|abbr=off}}; and the Wharves of Are Cristovao with terminals for wheat and liquid bulk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldportsource.com/ports/BRA_Port_of_Rio_de_Janeiro_1327.php |title=WPS – Port of Rio de Janeiro contact information |publisher=Worldportsource.com |date= |accessdate=31 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the Wharf of Gamboa, leaseholders operate terminals for sugar, paper, iron and steel products. Leaseholders at the Wharf of the Cashew operate terminals for [[roll-on/roll-off]] cargoes, containers, and liquid bulk. In 2004, the Port of Rio de Janeiro handled over seven million tons of cargo on almost 1700 vessels. In 2004, the Port of Rio de Janeiro handled over two million tons of containerized cargo in almost 171&amp;nbsp;thousand TEUs. The port handled 852&amp;nbsp;thousand tons of wheat, more than 1.8&amp;nbsp;million tons of iron and steel, over a million tons of liquid bulk cargo, almost 830&amp;nbsp;thousand tons of dry bulk, over five thousand tons of paper goods, and over 78&amp;nbsp;thousand vehicles. In 2003, over 91&amp;nbsp;thousand passengers moved through the Port of Rio Janeiro on 83 cruise vessels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldportsource.com/ports/BRA_Port_of_Rio_de_Janeiro_1327.php |title=Port of Rio de Janeiro |publisher=Worldportsource.com |accessdate=17 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public transportation===
[[File:Public transport map of Rio de Janeiro.png|thumb|upright=1.3|Public transport map]]
In Rio de Janeiro, buses are the main form of [[public transportation]]. There are nearly 440 municipal bus lines serving over four million passengers every day, in addition to intercity lines. Although cheap and frequent, Rio's transportation policy has been moving towards trains and subway in order to reduce surface congestion and increase carrier capacity. Rio's public transportation service has been a target of many critics and the motive of the 2013's protests and manifestations that started in São Paulo and spread through the entire country. According to the people, the raise in the bus and subway fares are invalid, seeing that the amount charged is too high for the low quality of the services.

The average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Rio de Janeiro, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 95 min. 32% of public transit riders, ride for more than 2 hours every day. The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 19 min, while 35% of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day. The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is 12.3&amp;nbsp;km, while 37% travel for over 12&amp;nbsp;km in a single direction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://moovitapp.com/insights/en/Moovit_Insights_Public_Transit_Index_Brazil_Rio_de_Janeiro-322|title=Rio de Janeiro Public Transportation Statistics|publisher=Global Public Transit Index by Moovit|accessdate=19 June 2017}} [[File:CC-BY icon.svg|50x50px]] Material was copied from this source, which is available under a [[creativecommons:by/4.0/|Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License]].&lt;/ref&gt;

====Subway and urban trains====
{{Main|Rio de Janeiro Metro|SuperVia}}
Rio de Janeiro has three [[Rapid transit|subway]] lines (''Metrô Rio'') with {{convert|58|km|mi|0}} and 41 stations plus several [[commuter rail]] lines. Future plans include building a fourth subway line to [[Niterói]] and [[São Gonçalo, Rio de Janeiro|São Gonçalo]], including an underwater tunnel beneath [[Guanabara Bay]] to supplement the ferry service currently there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://odia.terra.com.br/rio/htm/linha_3_do_metro_vai_receber_r_35_milhoes_da_uniao_152725.asp |title=O DIA Online&amp;nbsp;– Linha 3 do metrô vai receber R$35 milhões da União |publisher=odia.terra.com.br |date=21 February 2008 |accessdate=6 May 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080226043911/http://odia.terra.com.br/rio/htm/linha_3_do_metro_vai_receber_r_35_milhoes_da_uniao_152725.asp |archivedate=26 February 2008  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Rapid transit|Metro]] is Rio's safest and cleanest form of public transport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Do G1, no Rio, com informações da TV Globo |url=http://g1.globo.com/Noticias/Rio/0,,MUL1405729-5606,00.html |title=Metro Rio – Transport |publisher=G1.globo.com |accessdate=17 April 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514194749/http://g1.globo.com/Noticias/Rio/0%2C%2CMUL1405729-5606%2C00.html |archivedate=14 May 2011  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{double image|left|Tremsupervia.jpg|175|Metro Rio 01 2013 Ipanema Osorio 5408.JPG|250|Urban train from [[SuperVia]]|Train of [[Rio de Janeiro Metro]]}}

The three lines serve the city seven days a week. The first line runs from [[Tom Jobim Station|General Osório]] in [[Ipanema]] to Uruguai Station in [[Tijuca]]. The second line runs from Botafogo, sharing ten stations with the first line, terminating at Pavuna in northern Rio. The third connects [[Tom Jobim Station|General Osório]] to [[Jardim Oceânico Station]], in the Barra da Tijuca neighborhood, where the 2016 Olympic Games were held. The Metro runs services from 05:00&amp;nbsp;am to 12:00 midnight, Monday to Saturday, and from 07:00&amp;nbsp;am to 11:00&amp;nbsp;pm Sundays and public holidays. People can buy tickets for the Metro at train stations and can either buy single tickets or rechargeable cards. People can also buy tickets for the Metro at buses that make connect places far from the Metro. Integration with buses are possible in several forms, an integrated Metro and bus ticket for a single journey is available for some lines paying an additional fee and is known as an Integração Expressa (Express Integration) and Expresso Barra, the other possibility is taking the Metro na Superfície (Surface Metro) with no additional fee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metrorio.com.br/ |title=Metro Rio |publisher=Metro Rio |accessdate=17 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metrorio.com.br/integracoes.htm |title=Metro Rio Integrações |publisher=Metro Rio |accessdate=10 August 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071217095517/http://noticias.correioweb.com.br/materias.php?id=2715287&amp;sub=Esporte |archivedate=17 December 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[SuperVia]] connects the city of Rio with other locations in [[Greater Rio de Janeiro]] with surface trains. It has 8 lines and {{convert|270|km|mi|0}}, with 102 stations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.supervia.com.br/site/index.php |title=SuperVia |publisher=SuperVia |accessdate=16 October 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110106162745/http://www.supervia.com.br/site/index.php |archivedate=6 January 2011  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Light rail====
[[File:VLT Rio 05 2016 2109.jpg|thumb|[[Rio de Janeiro Light Rail]] in Downtown Rio.]]In order to improve traffic in the central zone, the prefecture started the project "Porto Maravilha" (Marvelous Port), which foresees a modern [[tram]]way system. Its lines will connect the central business district to [[Santos Dumont Airport]], the ferry station at XV Square, the [[Novo Rio Bus Terminal|Novo Rio terminal bus station]] at Santo Cristo, and the future [[high-speed rail]] Leopoldina station between Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.portomaravilha.com.br/web/esq/projEspVLT.aspx|title=Porto Maravilha|first=AM4 – A Internet de|last=Resultados|date=|work=portomaravilha.com.br}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, for the Olympic Games, the light rail system was inaugurated, with 28&amp;nbsp;km, 42 stations, distributed in 3 lines. The trams are the first in the world to use a combination of ground-level power supply (APS) and on-board supercapacitor energy storage (SRS), in order to eliminate overhead lines along the entire route.

====Bus====
{{main|Bus transport in Rio de Janeiro}}
[[File:Rio 01 2013 TransOeste 5811.JPG|thumb|left|[[TransOeste]] Bus Rapid Transit (BRT)]]
City buses cost about R$3.80 to ride. They come in both non-air conditioned (R$3.80)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://g1.globo.com/rio-de-janeiro/noticia/2016/01/tarifa-de-onibus-no-rio-aumenta-de-r-340-para-r-380-neste-sabado.html|title=Tarifa de ônibus no Rio aumenta de R$ 3,40 para R$ 3,80 neste sábado

It is necessary to have a registered electronic card (the "''Bilhete Único Carioca (BUC)''") in order to benefit of this system.

Another type of local bus is called the "''Frescão''" (air-conditioned). These buses run several routes, the main being from Centro through Botafogo, Copacabana and Ipanema to Leblon (and vice versa), and from the International Airport to Barra, through the beach road. They are air conditioned – about {{convert|22|°C|0|abbr=on}} – more upscale/comfortable and cost between R$6.00–R$12.00.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.realautoonibus.com.br/Site/NossasLinhas-Premium-00,undefined,REAL72219720120509134104-2.html|title=Nossas Linhas – Premium|publisher=Real Auto Ônibus|accessdate=9 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is only available during weekdays. The buses also run more frequently during the rush hours in the morning and evening. Going in the direction of Centro (city center), the bus can be flagged down on the beach road (buses with plaques showing "Castelo").

====Ferry====
[[File:Barca Pão de Açúcar (4).jpg|thumb|Rio de Janeiro ferry]]
The most geographically close sister city to Rio that is on the other side of [[Guanabara Bay]] is [[Niterói]]. Many people who live in Niterói, as well its neighbouring municipalities [[São Gonçalo, Rio de Janeiro|São Gonçalo]] and [[Maricá]], commute to Rio de Janeiro to study and work. There are several ferry services that operate between the Rio Centro ([[Praça XV Station|Praça XV]]) and Niterói (Centro and Charitas). There is a traditional boat as well as several "fast cat" [[hydrofoil]] boats.
One of the city neighborhoods is [[Paquetá Island]], which can only be accessed by ferryboats or hydrofoil boats. The ferryboat to Paquetá leaves every hour, from early in the morning until around midnight. There is also a ferry to [[Cocotá]].

====Tram====
Rio de Janeiro has the oldest operating electric tramway in Brazil and South America,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/soldon/sets/72157621419913875/ |title=Bonde de Santa Teresa – a set on Flickr |publisher=Flickr.com |date= |accessdate=12 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; now mainly used by tourists and less by daily commuters. [[Santa Teresa Tram]] or bondinho, has been preserved both as a piece of history and as a quick, fun, cheap way of getting to one of the most quirky parts of the city.&lt;ref name="Tram"/&gt; 
{{double image|left|Bondinho de Santa Teresa na Estação Carioca 03.jpg|190|Head-on view, Rio de Janeiro tram 10 on Rua Murtinho.jpg|190|[[Santa Teresa Tram]] is the oldest operating tram system in South America.}}

The tram station is near Cinelândia and the Municipal Theatre. Trams leave every half an hour between 6:00&amp;nbsp;am and 11:00&amp;nbsp;pm. A ticket is just {{BRL}}0.60 (US$0.35), one way or return, and people pay as they pass through the barrier to the right of the entrance. The Santa Teresa Tram (known locally as the "bonde") in the Brazilian city of Rio de Janeiro commenced electric operation in 1891, replacing horse-drawn trams and expanding the horse-drawn route. At this time the gauge was altered to {{convert|1100|mm|2|abbr=on}}, which remains the case today. The tram cars which are currently in operation are Brazilian-built, are of the cross-bench open sided design, and are fitted with trolley poles.&lt;ref name="Tram"&gt;[http://world.nycsubway.org/latinamerica/santateresa.html Santa Tereza Tram] הכטן7מריכטד7ג&lt;/ref&gt;

After a [[derail]] occurred on 28 August 2011,&lt;ref&gt;[http://g1.globo.com/rio-de-janeiro/noticia/2011/08/bombeiros-confirmam-cinco-mortos-em-acidente-com-bonde-no-rio.html G1: Bombeiros confirmam cinco mortos em acidente com bonde no Rio] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120220190928/http://g1.globo.com/rio-de-janeiro/noticia/2011/08/bombeiros-confirmam-cinco-mortos-em-acidente-com-bonde-no-rio.html |date=20 February 2012 }}. Retrieved 9 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; which left seven dead, tram service was suspended to improve the system, and would be reopened in 2014, just before the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]] but after postponements it was finally reopened in July 2015. While it is being improved, two lines costing {{BRL}}0.60 carry passengers from Santa Teresa to Centro: SE014 and SE006.

===Road transport===
[[File:Rio de Janeiro Ponte Niteroi Aerea 102 Feb 2006.jpg|thumb|right|[[Rio-Niterói Bridge]]]]

Driving in Rio de Janeiro, as in most large cities of Brazil, might not be the best choice because of the large car fleet. The city is served by a number of expressways, like Linha Vermelha, Linha Amarela, [[Avenida Brasil (Rio de Janeiro)|Avenida Brasil]], Avenida das Américas and Avenida Infante Dom Henrique ([[Aterro do Flamengo]]); in spite of this, traffic jams are very common.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rioholiday.com/Driving-in-Rio-de-Janeiro.htm |title=Driving in Rio de Janeiro |publisher=Rioholiday.com |accessdate=6 May 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090524065912/http://www.rioholiday.com/Driving-in-Rio-de-Janeiro.htm |archivedate=24 May 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the organization of the [[2016 Olympics]] the city is installing four [[Bus rapid transit|BRT]] systems to link [[Barra da Tijuca]] with other major neighbourhoods: [[TransOlimpica]] (between Barra and [[Deodoro (Rio de Janeiro)|Deodoro]]); TransBrasil (over the [[Avenida Brasil (Rio de Janeiro)|Avenida Brasil]] expressway); [[TransCarioca]] (between Barra and the Galeão International Airport); and [[TransOeste]] (between Barra and [[Santa Cruz, Rio de Janeiro|Santa Cruz]], over Avenida das Américas).

In Brazil, most interstate transportation is done by road. A large terminal for long-distance buses is in the Santo Cristo neighborhood of Rio de Janeiro. There are also two port facilities for cargo and passenger ships (Rio de Janeiro and [[Sepetiba]] port). Rio has roads to all neighbour [[States of Brazil|States]]. Some roads (like [[Rodovia Presidente Dutra|Via Dutra]], to São Paulo, and a stretch of the BR-101 which covers the Rio-Niterói bridge) were chartered to private enterprises. The quality of the highways improved much, but was accompanied by a significant increase of the toll fees. From [[São Paulo]]: take the BR-116 (Presidente Dutra Federal Highway) or the [[Brazilian Highway System|BR-101]] (Rio-Santos Federal Highway). From [[Belo Horizonte]]: BR-040. From [[Salvador, Bahia|Salvador]]: BR-101 or [[BR-324]]/BR-116/BR-393/BR-040.

===Bicycles===
[[File:BikeRio 11 2015 Praça Mauá 706.JPG|thumb|[[Bike Rio]] rental station located in Mauá Square, Downtown Rio]]
The city has {{convert|160|km|mi|abbr=on}} of cycle paths that, wherever they exist, are very much preferable to riding in the city's traffic. Most paths run alongside beaches and extend intermittently from the Marina da Glória, Centro, through Flamengo, Copacabana and Ipanema, to Barra da Tijuca and Recreio dos Bandeirantes. {{convert|6|km|mi|spell=in|abbr=off}} of cycle paths traverse the [[Tijuca Forest|Tijuca National Park]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldtravelguide.net/city/104/getting_around/South-America/Rio-de-Janeiro.html |title=Getting around Rio de Janeiro |publisher=Worldtravelguide.net |accessdate=17 April 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100127043742/http://www.worldtravelguide.net/city/104/getting_around/South-America/Rio-de-Janeiro.html |archivedate=27 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Bike Rio]] began operations in October 2011. This [[bicycle sharing system]] is sponsored by the municipal government of Rio de Janeiro in partnership with [[Itaú Unibanco|Banco Itaú]]. The bike sharing system has 600 bicycles available at 60 rental stations in 14 neighborhoods throughout the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://vejario.abril.com.br/especial/aluguel-bicicleta-rio-645043.shtml|title=Prefeitura lança Bike Rio, novo sistema de aluguel de bicicletas da cidade |language=Portuguese |trans-title=City Hall launches Bike Rio, the city's new bike sharing system |author=Louise Peres |work=[[Veja (magazine)|Veja Rio]] |date=28 October 2011 |accessdate=11 November 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130402101912/http://vejario.abril.com.br/especial/aluguel-bicicleta-rio-645043.shtml |archivedate=2 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://exame.abril.com.br/marketing/noticias/itau-patrocina-programa-de-aluguel-de-bicicletas-no-rio |title=Itaú patrocina programa de aluguel de bicicletas no Rio |language=Portuguese |trans-title=Itau sponsors bike sharing program in Rio |author=Louise Peres |work=[[Exame (magazine)|Exame]] |date=28 October 2011 |accessdate=11 November 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130402101927/http://exame.abril.com.br/marketing/noticias/itau-patrocina-programa-de-aluguel-de-bicicletas-no-rio |archivedate= 2 April 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Very Rev '''Robert Henry''' [[FRSE]] [[FSA(Scot)]] (18 February 1718 – 24 November 1790) was a Scottish [[Minister of the Kirk|minister]] and historian.

==Biography==
He was born on 18 February 1718, the son of Jean Galloway and James Henry, a farmer at Muirton Farm near [[St. Ninians]], [[Stirlingshire]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|title=Biographical Index of Former Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh 1783–2002|date=July 2006|publisher=The Royal Society of Edinburgh|isbn=0 902 198 84 X|url=https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Henry was educated at St Ninian's Parish School then [[Stirling High School]]. He then studied at the [[University of Edinburgh]]. After teaching at [[Annan, Dumfries and Galloway|Annan]], he entered the [[Church of Scotland]], being licensed in 1746 and first preaching in Annan. In 1748, as a dissenter, he moved to [[Carlisle, Cumbria|Carlisle]], and in 1760 to [[Berwick-upon-Tweed]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

He then was translated to be minister at [[Greyfriars Kirk, Edinburgh|New Greyfriars]] in [[Edinburgh]] in 1768. The University of Edinburgh granted him a doctorate (DD) in 1771. At this time he lived at Bristo Street, just south of Greyfriars Church.&lt;ref&gt;Edinburgh and Leith Post Office Directory 1773-74&lt;/ref&gt;

He was [[Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland]] in 1774.

In 1776 he moved from New Greyfriars to Old Greyfriars (the other half of the same building) and remained in this role until death.

In 1783 he was one of the co-founders of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]].

He died on 24 November 1790 at his home in Merchant Street in Edinburgh (just east of Greyfriars) but is buried with his family in [[Polmont]] churchyard.

==Family==

He was married to Anne Balderston.

==Works==

He wrote the 6-volume ''History of Great Britain on a New Plan'' (1771),&lt;ref&gt;Henry, Robert. ''The History of Great Britain, from the First Invasion of It by the Romans under Julius Cæser. Written on a New Plan.'' T.&amp;nbsp;Cadell (London), 1771.&lt;/ref&gt; covering the period from the [[Caesar's invasion of Britain|first Roman invasion]] until the reign of [[Henry VIII of England|King Henry VIII]]. The novelty consisted in dividing the subjects into different heads, civil history, military, social, and so on, and following out each of them separately. The work was mainly a compilation, having no critical qualities. Despite the persistent and ferocious attacks of [[Gilbert Stuart (writer)|Dr Gilbert Stewart]], it was successful, and brought the author over £3000. It attracted the support of the [[William Murray, 1st Earl of Mansfield|Earl of Mansfield]], whose persuasion gained for Henry a government pension of £100.

The '''Schoenau ultimatum''' was a [[hostage-taking]] incident in [[Marchegg]], [[Austria]] by the Palestinian militant group [[As-Sa'iqa]].  At the time Vienna was a transit point for [[Russian Jews]], the largest population of [[Jews]] remaining in Europe. The Schoenau ultimatum focused attention away from Egyptian and Syrian military build-up and their planned attack that would come to be known as the [[Yom Kippur War]].

==Background==
The Israeli government had long encouraged European Jewish refugees to immigrate to [[Israel]]. After many of the Jews displaced by the [[Holocaust]] had emigrated to Israel, the Russian Jewish population, the last source of [[Ashkenazi Jews]], who were facing increasing oppression within the [[Soviet Union]], became an important population encouraged to emigrate to Israel.&lt;ref name="Hughes-Wilson p. 248"&gt;{{Harvnb|Hughes-Wilson|1999|p=248}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the wake of the [[Six-Day War]] in 1967, the Soviet Union broke off diplomatic relations with Israel. This stirred up [[Zionist]] feelings among some Soviet Jews, the majority of whom were [[cultural assimilation|assimilated]] and [[secularity|non-religious]].

A mass emigration was politically undesirable for the Soviet regime. As increasing numbers of [[Aliyah from the Soviet Union in the 1970s|Soviet Jews applied to emigrate]] to Israel in the period following the Six-Day War, many were [[Refusenik (Soviet Union)|formally refused permission]] to leave. After the [[Dymshits–Kuznetsov hijacking affair]] in 1970 and the crackdown that followed, strong international condemnations caused the Soviet authorities to increase the emigration [[:wikt:quota|quota]]. From 1960 to 1970, only 4,000 people left the Soviet Union; in the following decade, the number rose to 250,000.&lt;ref name="Alekseyeva p. "&gt;{{Harvnb|Alekseyeva|1992|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of these Jews passed through the transit center located at the [[Schönau an der Triesting|Schönau]] Castle in Austria. The Castle was used by the Austrian government as a transit camp for Russian Jews who had just been permitted to leave Russia prior to emigrating to the West.&lt;ref name="Dank p. "&gt;{{Harvnb|Dank|1984|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hostage taking==

On September 28, 1973, 3 to 7{{#tag:ref|Sources give different number of the amount of hostages taken|group="A"}} Jewish emigrants were taken hostage, among them a 73-year-old man, an ailing woman and a three-year-old child, on a train at the Austria-[[Czechoslovakia]]n border by a Syrian-based [[Palestinian people|Palestinian Arab]] militant group, [[As-Sa'iqa]].&lt;ref name="Dank p. "/&gt;&lt;ref name="Avner p. "&gt;{{Harvnb|Avner|2011|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to demanding a free passage to an Arab country, they gave the Austrian government an ultimatum to close the Schönau transit center or they would execute the hostages.  [[Chancellor of Austria|Austrian Chancellor]] [[Bruno Kreisky]] gave in to the demands and closed the Jewish Agency's transit facility.

The incident captured the attention of Israeli media and became a ''[[cause célèbre]]''.&lt;ref name="Hughes-Wilson p. 248"/&gt; Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir diverted her return flight from the [[Council of Europe]] to try and convince Kreisky to not give in to the demands. Kreisky refused to change his position, and Meir returned to Israel infuriated.&lt;ref name="Avner p. 219"&gt;{{Harvnb|Avner|2010|p=219}}&lt;/ref&gt;  With the center closed, the militants were flown to Libya.&lt;ref name="Austria Press Agency p. "/&gt;

==Result==
The entire incident captured the attention of the Israeli government when it should have been focusing on Egyptian and Syrian military build-up. The Schoenau ultimatum is seen as one of the causes of the massive military intelligence blunder of the Israeli Intelligence in not foreseeing the surprise attack of the [[Yom Kippur War]].&lt;ref name="Hughes-Wilson p. 248"&gt;{{Harvnb|Hughes-Wilson|1999|p=248}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dank p. "/&gt;

In December 1973, the Schönau Castle Jewish center was closed for good and was replaced by the Wöllersdorf National Association of the Red Cross of Lower Austria for refugees.&lt;ref name="Austria Press Agency p. "&gt;{{Harvnb|Austria Press Agency|2011|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''shell grotto''' is a type of [[folly]], a [[grotto]] decorated with [[sea shell]]s.

==History==
The shell grotto was a popular feature of British country house in the 17th and 18th centuries.
It arose from the influence of the [[Rococo style]] (which used swirling motifs similar to sea shells)&lt;ref name=HJ&gt;Hazelle Jackson, ''Shell Houses and Grottoes'' ( 2001) {{ISBN|9780747805229}} ([http://www.londongardenstrust.org/features/grotto.htm abstract])&lt;/ref&gt;
and mimicry of architectural features from the [[Italian renaissance]] (themselves copies from Classical times).
The idea of a grotto was originally a means to enhance a dank [[undercroft]], or provide an antechamber before a ''[[piano nobile]]'', but later became a garden feature independent of the house.
Early grottos were mainly of the shell grotto type, mimicking a sea-cave, or in the form of a [[nymphaeum]]; later there was a move towards more naturalistic cave-like grottoes.&lt;ref name=HJ/&gt; 

The first recorded shell grotto in England was at [[Whitehall Palace]]; [[James VI and I|James I]] had it built in the undercroft of the [[Banqueting House, Whitehall|Banqueting House]] in 1624, but it hasn't survived. Two years later the [[Duke of Bedford]] had a shell room built at [[Woburn Abbey]], featuring shell mosaics and carved stone.
This, and another at [[Skipton Castle]], built in 1627, are the only surviving examples from the 17th century.&lt;ref name=HJ/&gt; 

Shell grottoes were an expensive luxury: The grotto at [[Oatlands Park]] cost £25,000 in 1781 and took 11 years to build; and at [[Fisherwick|Fisherwick Park]] the [[Marquess of Donegall]] spent £10,000 on shells alone in 1789.&lt;ref name=Tat&gt;[https://www.tatler.com/article/the-poshest-grottoes  ''The 4 poshest garden grottoes''] [[Tatler]] 27 July 2015; retrieved 30 July 2018&lt;/ref&gt; [[Shell Grotto, Margate|The Grotto]] at [[Margate]] has 2000 square feet of mosaic, using some 4.6 million shells.

By the end of the 18th century fashion had moved on to more naturalistic cave-like structures, before falling out of favour altogether. Many were demolished or have fallen into disrepair, but 
some 200 grottos of all types are known to have survived in some form in the UK.&lt;ref name=HJ/&gt;

'''Thomas Martin Lindsay''' [[Doctor of Divinity|DD]] [[FRSE]] (1843–1914) was a [[Scottish people|Scottish]] historian, professor and principal of the [[Trinity College, Glasgow|Free Church College, Glasgow]]. He was a prolific writer of church history and in authorship he is often referred to as '''Thomas M. Lindsay'''.

He wrote chiefly on [[church history]], his major works including ''Luther and the German Reformation'' (1900), and ''A History of the Reformation in Europe'' (1906–1907).

==Life==
He was born on 18 October 1843 in [[Lesmahagow]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Biographical Index of Former Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh 1783 – 2002|date=July 2006|publisher=The Royal Society of Edinburgh|isbn=0 902 198 84 X|url=https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Lanarkshire]], the eldest son of Rev. Alexander Lindsay, and his wife, Susan Irvine Martin. He was educated in Lesmahagow.

Lindsay studied divinity at the [[University of Glasgow]] and then at the [[University of Edinburgh]]. In 1869 he entered the ministry of the [[Free Church of Scotland (1843–1900)|Free Church of Scotland]], and in 1872 was appointed Professor of Church History at the [[Trinity College, Glasgow|Free Church College, Glasgow]]. He was then living at "Thornliebank" on Ann Street in the [[Hillhead]] district&lt;ref&gt;Glasgow Post Office Directory 1875&lt;/ref&gt; when he married Anna Dunlop. [[Anna Lindsay (Scotland)|Anna Lindsay]] had just been a student in Edinburgh.&lt;ref name=anna/&gt;

Lindsay took up the position of Principal of the College in 1902.&lt;ref name=odnb&gt;'Lindsay, Thomas Martin (1843–1914), historian' in [[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]] (Oxford University Press, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; He then moved to the more affluent address of 37 Westbourne Gardens in [[Kelvinside]],&lt;ref&gt;Glasgow Post Office Directory 1903&lt;/ref&gt; an attractive three-storey and basement Victorian terraced house.

Lindsay unsuccessfully supported [[William Robertson Smith]] in a trial for [[heresy]] between 1877 and 1881 which resulted in Smith's losing his position at the [[Christ's College, Aberdeen|Aberdeen Free Church College]].&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt;
He died in Glasgow on 6 December 1912.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Biographical Index of Former Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh 1783 – 2002|date=July 2006|publisher=The Royal Society of Edinburgh|isbn=0 902 198 84 X|url=https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Varduli''' were a pre-[[Ancient Rome|Roman]] tribe&lt;ref&gt;John James Van Nostrand Jr, ''The reorganization of Spain by Augustus" ''University of California Publications in History'' '''4''', 1916:122ff&lt;/ref&gt; settled in the north of the [[Iberian Peninsula]], in what today is the eastern region of the autonomous community of the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]] and western [[Navarre]], in northern [[Spain]]. Their historical territory corresponds with current [[Basque language|Basque]]-speaking areas, however it is debated whether the Varduli were actually [[Aquitani]]ans, related to the [[Vascones]],&lt;ref name="vascones"&gt;[http://www.euskomedia.org/PDFAnlt/congresos/07217221.pdf ''Localización de algunas ciudades várdulas citadas por Mela y Ptolomeo'' Ildefonso Gurruchaga]&lt;/ref&gt; or if they were [[Celts]], related to tribes such as the [[Cantabri]] and [[Celtiberians]]&lt;ref name="celtiberians"&gt;[http://www.euskara.it/dipartimento-basco-uni-upter/HITZALDIAK%20-%20CONFERENZE/MERTXE___URTEAGA.pdf ''El puerto romano de Irun'' Mercedes Urteaga]&lt;/ref&gt; and which later underwent [[Late Basquisation|Basquisation]].&lt;ref name="ethnic map"&gt;[http://www.arkeotavira.com/Mapas/Iberia/Populi.htm Ethnic map of the Iberian Peninsula after the Second Punic War]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==

Their ethnonym ''Varduli'' is connected with an area that is referred to in documents from the early [[Middle Ages]] as [[Bardulia]], which is identified as the cradle of [[Old Castile]]. [[Julio Caro Baroja]], a Spanish anthropologist and linguist declared on his works that the term ''Varduli'' does not have a [[Basque language|Basque]] origin.&lt;ref&gt;Caro Baroja, Julio. ''Los pueblos de España'', 1976.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

The Varduli are mentioned for the first time during [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] times, by [[Strabo]], who called them ''Bardyetai'', and placed them in the Basque coast, between the [[Cantabri]] and [[Vascones]]; they are also mentioned by the geographer [[Ptolemy]], who placed them roughly in present-day [[Gipuzkoa]], and by Roman historians, notably [[Pliny the Elder]] in his ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Naturalis Historia]]'',&lt;ref&gt;"In Cluniensem conventum Varduli ducunt populos xiiii" (Pliny iii.26); "A Pyranaeo per oceanum Vasconum saltus, Olarso, Vardulorum oppida..." iv.110..&lt;/ref&gt; where he reported that ''Amanum Portus'' (Roman name: ''Flaviobriga''), present-day [[Castro Urdiales]], was a Varduli city. The Roman geographer [[Pomponius Mela]] located them also in the coast, west of the Vascones and east of the [[Caristii]]. This lack of agreement about their exact position may have been caused by the continuous movement of the tribes of the northern Iberian Peninsula during events such as the [[Cantabrian Wars]]. The first census of the Varduli population took place under the orders of [[Augustus]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum|CIL]]'' vi, 1463, noted by Van Nostrand 1916:123.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Pliny the Elder]], the main Varduli city was ''Olarso'',{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} which is believed to be present-day [[Uharte-Arakil]] ([[Navarre]]). In 114 BC, [[Gaius Marius]] had a personal guard made by Varduli people, who were called Barduaioí slaves in [[Rome]]. By the year 44, and according to Pomponius Mela, the Varduli inhabited lands close to the [[Pyrenees]] and composed a united society. The defeat of the [[Cantabri]] against Augustus did not have any effect on the Varduli, as they had not joined the wars. 

The Varduli served in [[Cohort (military unit)|cohort]]s in the province of [[Britannia]]: Varduli are mentioned in an inscription on a Roman altar at Rochester, (Roman Bremenium) and at [[Milecastle 19]] along [[Hadrian's Wall]] an altar inscription made by members of the First Cohort of Varduli, cavalrymen, is one of the few dedications to the [[Matres|''Matres'', or mother goddesses]], found in Roman Britain. The First Cohort of Varduli are also mentioned in inscriptions at the [[Antonine Wall]], [[Longovicium]] in Durham, [[Bremenium]] and [[Corstopitum]] in Northumberland and on the [[Dere Street]] in Cappuck in the Scottish Borders.&lt;ref name=rbo&gt;{{cite web|title=BREMENIVM Roman Fort &amp; Marching Camps|url=http://www.roman-britain.org/places/bremenium.htm|publisher=Roman Britain Organisation|accessdate=11 March 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120414183611/http://www.roman-britain.org/places/bremenium.htm|archive-date=14 April 2012|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

As with the [[Caristii]], it is discussed whether the Varduli were an [[Aquitani]]an tribe or a [[Celts|Celt]] one, related to the [[Cantabri]] and [[Celtiberians]]. Their place-names were clearly of Indo-European origin (probably [[Proto-Celtic language]]), as ''Uxama'' (comes from ''Ups Ama'', meaning "the highest"), ''Deobriga'' (comes from ''Deiuo-Briga'', meaning "holy hill"), ''Tullonium'' (comes from ''Tullo'', meaning "valley"), among others. As with the Caristii, not a single toponym related to the [[Aquitanian language|Aquitanian]]-[[Proto-Basque language|Basque languages]] has been found, further proving the theory of their Celtic origin and possible [[late Basquisation]].&lt;ref name="vascones" /&gt;&lt;ref name="celtiberians" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ethnic map" /&gt; However, but for a few exceptions (''Deba'', ''[[Zegama]]'', ''Arakama'') present-day place-names show a clear prevalence of the Basque linguistic element (sometimes mixed with Latin and Romance lexical roots).

The last reference to the Varduli appears on a chronicle from [[Hydatius]], where he narrates the devastations that suffered the [[Heruli]] when they attacked in the year 400 the [[Bay of Biscay|Cantabrian coast]] and again in 456 after attacking [[Bardulia]].

{{quote|Ad sedes propias redeuntes, Cantabriarum et Vardaliarum loca maritima crudelissime deproedatio sunt.|Fontes Hispaniae Antiquae, IX, p. 74}} Later in the next century, Saxons established on the Bordeaux estuary also were known to raid along the coast.

It is believed by some that the Varduli suffered a [[Late Basquisation|Basquisation]] as a result of the continuous progress of the [[Vascones]] on their territory. They are not mentioned again in the [[Early Middle Ages]] and their place appeared the precursors of the province of [[Gipuzkoa]]. Some authors&lt;ref&gt;http://www.euskomedia.org/PDFAnlt/congresos/07217221.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; deducted, following Classic documents, the existence of some ethnic affinity, collaboration, or political union between the [[Caristii]], the [[Autrigones]] and the Varduli, tribes who later would all be grouped under the name ''Varduli'', this would explain all the later events on this region, for example, why once the Caristii and Varduli were moved out of their original territories by the [[Vascones]] in the Early Middle Ages, the Caristii and Autrigones lost their names and were grouped together with the Varduli over the territory of the Autrigones who took refuge in their coastal areas behind the mountains from the Islamic military depredations from the Al-andalus new powers down the Ebro, which passed to be made after a century of resettlement into the Meseta plains as a frontier march or county of the Kingdom of [[Kingdom of Asturias|Asturias]] in the middle years of the 8th century, the original one called Castile. The union, whichever the causes, between Varduli, Caristii and Autrigones on a unique territory would later create the blur County of Bardulia, mentioned as part of the Crown of Castile.

The coat of arms of the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque]] province of [[Gipuzkoa]] reads ''"Fidelissima Bardulia, Nunquam Superata"'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://w390w.gipuzkoa.net/WAS/CORP/DJGPortalWEB/territorio_historico_de_gipuzkoa.jsp?id=02&amp;idioma=es Juntas Generales de Gipuzkoa - Escudo y bandera]&lt;/ref&gt; meaning "Loyal Bardulia, never conquered".

The witch-cult hypothesis states that such stories are based upon a real-life pagan cult that revered a horned god.]]

The '''witch-cult hypothesis''' is a discredited theory which proposes that the [[Witch trials in the early modern period|witch trials of the Early Modern period]] were an attempt to suppress a pre-Christian, [[paganism|pagan]] religion that had survived the Christianisation of Europe. According to its proponents, this witch-cult revolved around the worship of a [[Horned God]] of fertility whom the Christian persecutors referred to as the [[Devil]], and whose members participated in nocturnal rites at the [[witches' Sabbath]] in which they venerated this deity.

The theory was pioneered by German scholars [[Karl Ernst Jarcke]] and Franz Josef Mone in the early nineteenth century, before being adopted by the French historian [[Jules Michelet]], American feminist [[Matilda Joslyn Gage]], and American folklorist [[Charles Leland]] later in that century. The hypothesis received its most prominent exposition when adopted by the British Egyptologist [[Margaret Murray]], who presented her version of it in ''The Witch-Cult in Western Europe'' (1921), before further expounding it in books like ''The God of the Witches'' (1931) and in her contribution to the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]''.  Although the "Murrayite theory" proved popular among sectors of academia and the general public in the early and mid twentieth century, it was never accepted by specialists in the Early Modern witch trials, who publicly discredited it through in-depth research conducted in the 1960s and 1970s.

Specialists in Europe's Early Modern witchcraft beliefs view the pagan witch-cult theory as [[pseudohistory|pseudohistorical]]; there is an academic consensus among experts that those accused and executed as witches during the period were not members of any witch religion, whether pre-Christian or Satanic in nature. Critics highlight that the theory rested on a highly selective use of the evidence from the trials, thereby heavily misrepresenting the events and the actions of both the accused and their accusers. Further, they point out that it relied on the erroneous assumption that the claims made by accused witches were truthful and not distorted by coercion and torture. They also note that despite claims that the witch-cult was a pre-Christian survival, there is no evidence of such a pagan witch-cult throughout the intervening Middle Ages.

The witch-cult hypothesis influenced literature, being adapted into fictional forms in the work of authors like [[John Buchan]] and [[Robert Graves]]. It greatly affected the origins of [[Wicca]], a [[Modern paganism|contemporary Pagan]] [[new religious movement]] that emerged in mid-twentieth century Britain, claiming to be the survival of the pagan witch-cult. Since the 1960s, scholars like [[Carlo Ginzburg]] have argued that surviving elements of pre-Christian religion in European folk culture influenced the Early Modern stereotypes of witchcraft, with scholars debating how this relates to the Murrayite witch-cult hypothesis.

==Early modern precedents==
{{Further|Witches' Sabbath|Witch trials in Early Modern Europe}}

The witch-hunt of the 16th and 17th centuries was an organized effort by authorities in many countries to destroy a supposed conspiracy of witches thought to pose a deadly threat to [[Christendom]]. According to these authorities, witches were numerous, and in conscious alliance with Satan, forming a sort of Satanic counter-religion. Witch-hunts in this sense must be separated from the belief in witches, the [[evil eye]], and other such phenomena, which are common features of [[folk belief]] worldwide. The belief that witches are not just individual villains but conspirators organized in a powerful but well-hidden cult is a distinguishing feature of the early modern witch-hunt.

This idea of an organized witch-cult originates in the second half of the 15th century, notoriously expounded in the 1486 ''[[Malleus Maleficarum]]''. In the following two centuries, witch trials usually included the charge of membership in a demonic conspiracy, gathering in sabbaths, and similar. It was only with the beginning [[Age of Enlightenment]] in the early 18th century, that the idea of an organized witch-cult was abandoned.

Early Modern testimonies of accused witches "confirming" the existence of a witch cult are considered doubtful. Norman Cohn has argued that such testimonies were often given under torture, and that their details were determined mainly by the expectations of the interrogators and by free association on the part of the accused, reflecting only the popular imagination of the times.&lt;ref&gt;Cohn, Norman (1977) ''Europe's Inner Demons''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Carlo Ginzburg]] and [[Éva Pócs]] hold that some of these testimonies can still give insights into the belief systems of the accused. Ginzburg discovered records of a group calling themselves ''[[benandanti]]'', the "good walkers" who believed that they combatted witches (''streghe'') by magical means. The benandanti were persecuted for heresy in the period of 1575 to 1675.&lt;ref name="GinzburgEcstasies"&gt;Ginzburg, Carlo. ''Ecstasies: Deciphering the Witches' Sabbath''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The early theory==
===Jarcke and Mone===

Throughout the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, the common belief among educated sectors of the European populace was that there had never been any genuine cult of witches and that all those persecuted and executed as such had been innocent of the crime.{{sfn|Cohn|1975|p=103}} At this time, two figures independently raised the prospect that the witch trials had been influenced by stereotypes and folk customs that had pre-Christian origins.{{sfn|Cohn|1975|p=103}} In his 1749 work ''Del Congresso Notturno delle Lamie'' (''On the Nocturnal Meeting of Witches''), the Italian cleric [[Girolamo Tartarotti]] claimed that the stereotype of the witch in Early Modern Europe was influenced by pre-Christian folk beliefs.{{sfnm|1a1=Cohn|1y=1975|1p=103|2a1=Hutton|2y=1999|2p=137}} Similar ideas were echoed by the German folklorist [[Jacob Grimm]] in his ''Deutsche Mythologie'' (''Teutonic Mythology''), first published in 1835. Here, he claimed that the witch stereotype reflected a blending of pre-Christian folk traditions with the later Medieval views of [[heresy]].{{sfnm|1a1=Cohn|1y=1975|1p=103|2a1=Hutton|2y=1999|2p=137}} Both Tartarotti and Grimm would subsequently be erroneously cited as claiming that the witches had been members of a surviving pre-Christian cult.{{Sfn|Hutton|1999|p=137}}

The first modern scholar to advance the claim that the witch trials had been designed to wipe out an anti-Christian sect was the German [[Karl Ernst Jarcke]], a professor of criminal law at the [[University of Berlin]]. In 1828 he edited the records of a seventeenth-century German witch trial for publication in a legal journal, and included the theory in his own comments. Jarcke suggested that witchcraft had been a pre-Christian religion that survived Christianisation among the rural population, but that after being condemned as Satanism by the Church, it eventually degenerated into genuine Devil-worship and malevolence. At that point, the wider population came to reject it, resulting in the trials.{{sfnm|1a1=Cohn|1y=1975|1pp=103&amp;ndash;104|2a1=Purkiss|2y=1996|2p=34|3a1=Hutton|3y=1999|3p=136}} This theory exonerated the Christian Church of blame by asserting that they had been acting on the wishes of the population, while at the same time not accepting the literal intervention of the Devil in human affairs which liberal rationalists disbelieved.{{sfn|Hutton|1999|p=136}} In 1832, [[Felix Mendelssohn]] adopted similar ideas when composing his orchestral piece, [[Die erste Walpurgisnacht|''Die Erste Walpurgisnacht'']], in which a group of pagan villagers pretend to be witches in order to scare away Christians intent on disrupting their [[Walpurgis Night]] festivities.{{sfn|Hutton|1999|p=137}}

Jarcke's theories were adopted and altered by the German historian [[Franz Josef Mone]] in 1839. While serving as director of archives at [[Baden]], he published his ideas in a paper in which he asserted that the pre-Christian religion which degenerated into Satanic witchcraft was not Germanic in origin, but had instead been practised by slaves who had come in contact with the Greek cults of [[Hecate]] and [[Dionysus]] on the north coast of the [[Black Sea]]. According to Mone, these slaves adopted these cults and fused them with their own pagan faiths to form witchcraft, a religion that venerated a goat-like god, celebrated nocturnal orgies and practised poisoning and malevolent magic. This horrified the free-born population both in the pagan period and the Christian era, eventually resulting in the witch trials.{{sfnm|1a1=Cohn|1y=1975|1p=104|2a1=Hutton|2y=1999|2pp=136&amp;ndash;137}} However, as English historian [[Norman Cohn]] asserted in 1975, "neither of [Jarcke or Mone's] theories are convincing", with neither being able to show any evidence of pre-Christian gods being worshipped in [[Early Modern Germany]] or being able to explain why there was no accounts of this witch-cult in between the Christianization and the trials themselves.{{sfn|Cohn|1975|p=104}} Both Jarcke and Mone were politically conservative, and their depiction of the threatening witch-cult would have had parallels with the widespread conservative fear of [[secret societies]] as bringers of revolution and irreligion in early nineteenth-century Europe.{{sfnm|1a1=Cohn|1y=1975|1p=105|2a1=Hutton|2y=1999|2pp=136&amp;ndash;137}}

===Michelet, Gage, and Leland===
[[File:Aradia-title-page.jpg|thumb|right|1899 cover of ''[[Aradia, or the Gospel of the Witches]]'']]

In 1862, French historian [[Jules Michelet]] published ''[[Satanism and Witchcraft|La Sorcière]]'' (''The Witch''), in which he adapted the theory further. Michelet, who was a liberal and who despised both the [[Roman Catholic Church]] and absolute monarchies, claimed that the Witch Cult had been practiced by the peasants in opposition to Roman Catholicism, which was practiced by the upper classes.&lt;ref&gt;''A New History of Witchcraft'', Russell &amp; Alexander, Thames &amp; Hudson, page 147&lt;/ref&gt; He claimed that the witches had been mostly women (he greatly admired the feminine gender, once claiming that it was the superior of the two), and that they had been great healers, whose knowledge was the basis of much of modern medicine.&lt;ref name="Modern Pagan Witchcraft page 140"&gt;''The Triumph of the Moon - The Rise of Modern Pagan Witchcraft'', [[Ronald Hutton]], page 140&lt;/ref&gt; He believed that they worshiped the god [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]], who had become equated with the Christian figure of the Devil over time.&lt;ref&gt;''The Triumph of the Moon - The Rise of Modern Pagan Witchcraft'', [[Ronald Hutton]], Oxford University Press, 1999, page 140&lt;/ref&gt;  When Michelet's ''La Sorcière'' was first published in France, it was, according to historian [[Ronald Hutton]], "greeted with silence from French literary critics, apparently because they recognized that it was not really history".&lt;ref name="Modern Pagan Witchcraft page 140" /&gt;

In 1893, an American suffragist, [[Matilda Joslyn Gage]], published ''Woman, Church and State'', in which she claimed that in the prehistoric world, humanity had been [[matriarchy|matriarchal]], worshiping a great Goddess, and that the witches of the witch cult had been pagan priestesses preserving this religion.&lt;ref&gt;''The Triumph of the Moon - The Rise of Modern Pagan Witchcraft'', [[Ronald Hutton]], Oxford University Press, 1999, page 141&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1897, the English scholar [[Karl Pearson]], who was the professor of Applied Mathematics at [[University College London]] and an amateur historian and anthropologist, expanded on Michelet's theory. Pearson agreed with the theory of a prehistoric matriarchal society, and concurred with Gage that the witch-cult was a survival of it. Pearson theorized that during the Christian era, the religion began to emphasise the male deity, which was then equated with the Christian Devil. Pearson also made the claim that [[Joan of Arc]] had been one of the last few priestesses of the religion. He was, however, unlike Michelet or Gage, opposed to the group and to Goddess worship in general, believing that it was primitive and savage.&lt;ref&gt;''The Triumph of the Moon - The Rise of Modern Pagan Witchcraft'', [[Ronald Hutton]],  Oxford University Press, 1999, page 149-150&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Charles Leland]] was an American folklorist and occultist who travelled around Europe in the latter 19th century and was a supporter of Michelet's theories. In 1899 he published ''[[Aradia, or the Gospel of the Witches]]'', which he claimed had been a sacred text for Italian witches. It made no mention of a [[horned god]], but did mention a male deity known as [[Lucifer]], as well as a female deity, the goddess [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]]. Leland's work would provide much of the inspiration for the [[neopagan]] witchcraft religion of [[Stregheria]].

==The impact of Margaret Murray==
In 1915, [[Margaret Murray]] was an Egyptologist who worked under Sir [[Flinders Petrie]] at [[University College London]]. However, the outbreak of [[World War I]] had meant that many of their staff and students had abandoned scholarship to aid the British war effort, while archaeological excavation to Egypt had been rendered impossible. These events gave Murray more latitude in her studies, and she began to branch out and explore other interests.{{sfn|Sheppard|2013|p=161}} To aid Britain's war effort, Murray enrolled as a volunteer nurse in the [[Volunteer Aid Detachment]] of the College Women's Union Society, and for several weeks was posted to [[Saint-Malo]] in France.{{sfn|Sheppard|2013|pp=98, 162}} However, after being taken ill herself, she was sent to recuperate in [[Glastonbury]], [[Somerset]], where she became interested in [[Glastonbury Abbey]] and the folklore surrounding it which connected it to the legendary figure of [[King Arthur]] and to the idea that the [[Holy Grail]] had been brought there by [[Joseph of Aramathea]].{{sfn|Sheppard|2013|p=163}} Pursuing this interest, she published the paper "Egyptian Elements in the Grail Romance" in the journal ''Ancient Egypt'', although few agreed with her conclusions and it was criticised by scholars like [[Jessie Weston]] for making unsubstantiated leaps with the evidence.{{sfn|Sheppard|2013|pp=164&amp;ndash;165}}

Returning to London, she began to work on the concept of witchcraft.{{sfn|Sheppard|2013|pp=166&amp;ndash;167}} Her first published work on the subject was an article in the academic journal ''Folklore'' in 1917,{{sfn|Sheppard|2013|p=167}}&lt;ref name="FL28-3"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Murray|first=M. A.|year=1917|title=Organisations of Witches in Great Britain|journal=Folk-Lore |publisher=Folk-Lore Society|location=London|volume=28|issue=3|pages=228–258|url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Folk-Lore._Volume_28/Organisations_of_Witches_in_Great_Britain|doi=10.1080/0015587x.1917.9718983}}&lt;/ref&gt; which she followed with a second in 1920.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Murray|first=M. A.|year=1920|title=Witches and the Number Thirteen|journal=Folk-Lore |publisher=Folk-Lore Society|location=London|volume=31|issue=3|pages=204–209|url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Folk-Lore._Volume_28/Organisations_of_Witches_in_Great_Britain|doi=10.1080/0015587x.1920.9719151}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further articles on the subject appeared in the journal of the [[Royal Anthropological Institute]] and the ''Scottish Historical Review''.&lt;ref name="Moon page 195"&gt;''The Triumph of the Moon: A History of Modern Pagan Witchcraft'', [[Ronald Hutton]], page 195&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Witch-Cult in Western Europe'': 1921===
[[File:Margaret Murray bust.jpg|thumb|right|Bust of Murray held in the library of the [[UCL Institute of Archaeology]].]]
In ''The Witch-Cult in Western Europe'', Murray stated that she had restricted her research to Great Britain, although made some recourse to sources from France, Flanders, and [[New England]].{{sfn|Murray|1962|p=6}} She drew a division between what she termed "Operative Witchcraft", which referred to the performance of charms and spells with any purpose, and "Ritual Witchcraft", by which she meant "the ancient religion of Western Europe", a fertility-based faith that she also termed "the Dianic cult".{{sfn|Murray|1962|pp=11&amp;ndash;12}} She claimed that the cult had "very probably" once been devoted to the worship of both a male deity and a "Mother Goddess" but that "at the time when the cult is recorded the worship of the male deity appears to have superseded that of the female".{{sfn|Murray|1962|p=13}} In her thesis, Murray claimed that the figure referred to as the Devil in the trial accounts was the witches' god, "manifest and incarnate", to whom the witches' offered their prayers. She claimed that at the witches' meetings, the god would be personified, usually by a man or at times by a woman or an animal; when a human personified this entity, Murray claimed that they were usually dressed plainly, though they appeared in full costume for the witches' Sabbaths.{{sfn|Murray|1962|pp=28&amp;ndash;31}}

Members joined the cult either as children or adults through what Murray called "admission ceremonies"; Murray asserted that applicants had to agree to join of their own free will, and agree to devote themselves to the service of their deity. She also claimed that in some cases, these individuals had to sign a covenant or were baptized into the faith.{{sfn|Murray|1962|pp=71, 79, 82}} At the same time, she claimed that the religion was largely passed down hereditary lines.{{sfn|Murray|1962|p=225}} Murray described the religion as being divided into [[coven]]s containing thirteen members,{{sfn|Murray|1962|pp=190&amp;ndash;191}} led by a coven officer who was often termed the "Devil" in the trial accounts, but who was accountable to a "Grand Master".{{sfn|Murray|1962|p=186}} According to Murray, the records of the coven were kept in a secret book,{{sfn|Murray|1962|pp=194&amp;ndash;197}} with the coven also disciplining its members, to the extent of executing those deemed traitors.{{sfn|Murray|1962|pp=197&amp;ndash;200}}

Describing this witch-cult as "a joyous religion",{{sfn|Murray|1962|p=15}} she claimed that the two primary festivals that it celebrated were on May Eve and November Eve, although that other dates of religious observation were 1 February and 1 August, the winter and summer solstices, and Easter.{{sfn|Murray|1962|pp=12&amp;ndash;13, 109}} She asserted that the "General Meeting of all members of the religion" were known as Sabbaths, while the more private ritual meetings were known as Esbats.{{sfn|Murray|1962|p=97}} Murray claimed that these Esbats were nocturnal rites that began at midnight,{{sfn|Murray|1962|pp=111&amp;ndash;112}} and that they were "primarily for business, whereas the Sabbath was purely religious." At the former,{{which|date=December 2017}} magical rites were performed both for malevolent and benevolent ends.{{sfn|Murray|1962|p=112}} She also asserted that the Sabbath ceremonies involved the witches' paying homage to the deity, renewing their "vows of fidelity and obedience" to him, and providing him with accounts of all the magical actions that they had conducted since the previous Sabbath. Once this business had been concluded, admissions to the cult or marriages were conducted; ceremonies and fertility rites took place; and the Sabbath concluded with feasting and dancing.{{sfn|Murray|1962|p=124}}

Deeming Ritual Witchcraft to be "a fertility cult", she asserted that many of its rites were designed to ensure fertility and rain-making.{{sfn|Murray|1962|p=169}} She claimed that there were four types of sacrifice performed by the witches: blood-sacrifice, in which the neophyte writes their name in blood, the sacrifice of animals, the sacrifice of a non-Christian child to procure magical powers, and the sacrifice of the witches' god by fire to ensure fertility.{{sfn|Murray|1962|pp=152&amp;ndash;162}}
She interpreted accounts of witches' shapeshifting into various animals as being representative of a rite in which the witches dressed as specific animals which they took to be sacred.{{sfn|Murray|1962|pp=30&amp;ndash;32}} She asserted that accounts of [[familiar]]s were based on the witches' use of animals, which she divided into "divining familiars" used in [[divination]] and "domestic familiars" used in other magic rites.{{sfn|Murray|1962|pp=205&amp;ndash;208}}

Murray asserted that paganism had survived the Christianization process in Britain, although that it came to be "practised only in certain places and among certain classes of the community."{{sfn|Murray|1962|p=19}} She believed that folkloric stories of fairies in Britain were based on a surviving race of dwarves, who continued to live in the island up until the Early Modern period. She asserted that this race followed the same pagan religion as the witches, thus explaining the folkloric connection between the two.{{sfn|Murray|1962|pp=14, 238}} In the appendices to the book, she also alleged that [[Joan of Arc]] and [[Gilles de Rais]] were members of the witch-cult and were executed for it,{{sfn|Murray|1962|pp=270&amp;ndash;279}} a claim which has been refuted by historians, especially in the case of Joan of Arc.&lt;ref&gt;Pernoud, Regine. "Joan of Arc By Herself And Her Witnesses", pp. 16-20, 56, 65, 87, 155.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Noble|2005|p=14}}

Later historian [[Ronald Hutton]] commented that ''The Witch-Cult in Western Europe'' "rested upon a small amount of archival research, with extensive use of printed trial records in 19th century editions, plus early modern pamphlets and works of demonology".{{sfn|Hutton|1999|p=195}} He also noted that the book's tone was generally "dry and clinical, and every assertion was meticulously footned to a source, with lavish quotation."{{sfn|Hutton|1999|p=195}} It was not a best seller; in its first thirty years, only 2,020 copies were sold.{{sfn|Hutton|1999|p=199}} However, it led many people to treat Murray as an authority on the subject; in 1929, she was invited to provide the entry on "Witchcraft" for the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'', and used it to present her interpretation of the subject as if it were universally accepted in scholarship. It remained in the encyclopedia until being replaced in 1968.{{sfnm|1a1=Simpson|1y=1994|1p=89|2a1=Sheppard|2y=2013|2p=169}}

===''The God of the Witches'': 1931===
Murray followed this book with ''The God of the Witches'' in 1931; although similar in content, it was aimed at a mass market audience and published by the popular press [[Sampson Low]].{{sfn|Hutton|1999|p=196}} Whereas the tone in ''The Witch-Cult in Western Europe'' had been "dry and academic, the second bubbles with enthusiasm", as her language becomes "emotionally inflated and coloured with religious phraseology"; in particular she refers repeatedly to the cult as "the Old Religion".{{sfn|Simpson|1994|p=93}} In this work she "cut out or toned down" many of the claims of her previous book which would have painted the cult in a bad light, for instance regarding animal and child sacrifice, and also omitted any mention of sex.{{sfn|Simpson|1994|p=93}}

In this book she began to refer to the witches' deity as the [[Horned God]], and asserted that it was an entity who had been worshipped in Europe since the [[Palaeolithic]].{{sfn|Murray|1952|p=13}}  She further asserted that in the Bronze Age, the worship of the deity could be found throughout Europe, Asia, and parts of Africa, claiming that the depiction of [[Horned deity|various horned figures]] from these societies proved that. Among the evidence cited were the horned figures found at [[Mohenjo-Daro]], which are often interpreted as depictions of [[Pashupati]], as well as the deities [[Osiris]] and [[Amun|Amon]] in Egypt and the [[Minotaur]] of [[Minoan Crete]].{{sfn|Murray|1952|pp=24&amp;ndash;27}} Within continental Europe, she claimed that the Horned God was represented by [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]] in Greece, [[Cernunnos]] in Gaul, and in various Scandinavian rock carvings.{{sfn|Murray|1952|pp=28&amp;ndash;29}} Claiming that this divinity had been declared the Devil by the Christian authorities, she nevertheless asserted that his worship was testified in officially Christian societies right through to the Modern period, citing folkloric practices such as the [[Dorset Ooser]] and the [[Puck Fair]] as evidence of his veneration.{{sfn|Murray|1952|pp=32&amp;ndash;37, 43&amp;ndash;44}}

===''The Divine King in England'': 1954===
In 1954, she published ''The Divine King in England'', in which she greatly extended on the theory, taking in an influence from [[Sir James Frazer]]'s ''[[The Golden Bough]]'', an anthropological book that made the claim that societies all over the world sacrificed their kings to the deities of nature. In her book, she claimed that this practice had continued into medieval England, and that, for instance, the death of [[William II of England|William II]] was really a ritual sacrifice.  She also claimed that a number of important figures who died violent deaths, such as Archbishop [[Thomas Becket]], were killed as a replacement for the king.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, M.A. ''The Divine King in England''&lt;/ref&gt;  No academic took the book seriously, and it was ignored by many of her supporters.{{sfn|Noble|2005|p=12}}  It did however influence a few historical novels e.g. [[Philip Lindsay]]'s ''The Devil and King John''.

===Academic reception: 1921–63===
Upon initial publication, Murray's thesis gained a favourable reception from many readers, including a number of significant scholars, albeit none of whom were experts in the witch trials.{{sfn|Hutton|1999|p=199}} Historians of Early Modern Britain like [[George Norman Clark|Sir George Clark]] and [[Christopher Hill (historian)|Christopher Hill]] incorporated her theories into their work, although Hill later publicly regretted doing so.{{sfn|Thomas|1971|p=515}}&lt;ref&gt;Pp 191-2 Writing witch-hunt histories : challenging the paradigm / edited by Marko Nenonen and Raisa Maria Toivo. Boston Brill, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; For the 1961 reprint of ''The Witch-Cult in Western Europe'', Medieval historian [[Steven Runciman]] provided a foreword in which he accepted that some of Murray's "minor details may be open to criticism",{{sfn|Runciman|1962|p=5}} but in which he was otherwise supportive of her thesis.{{sfn|Cohn|1975|p=108}} Her theories were recapitulated by [[Pennethorne Hughes]] in his 1952 book ''Witches''.{{sfn|Hughes|1952}} It was also adopted and championed by the archaeologist [[T. C. Lethbridge]], marking his increasing estrangement from mainstream academia; in turn, Murray publicly defended his controversial theories regarding the chalk hill figures of [[Wandlebury Hill]] in the [[Gog Magog Hills]], [[Cambridgeshire]].{{sfn|Welbourn|2011|pp=156&amp;ndash;159}} As a result, a commentator writing in 1962 could comment that the Murrayite interpretations of the witch trials "seem to hold, at the time of writing, an almost undisputed sway at the higher intellectual levels", being widely accepted among "educated people".{{sfn|Rose|1962|p=14}}

Canadian historian Elliot Rose suggested that the reason why Murray's theory gained such support was partly because of her "imposing credentials" as a member of staff at UCL, a position that lent her theory greater legitimacy in the eyes of many readers.{{sfn|Rose|1962|p=15}} He further suggested that the Murrayite view was attractive to many as it confirmed "the general picture of pre-Christian Europe a reader of Frazer of [Robert] Graves would be familiar with".{{sfn|Rose|1962|p=15}} Similarly, Hutton suggested that the cause of the Murrayite theory's popularity was because it "appealed to so many of the emotional impulses of the age", including "the notion of the English countryside as a timeless place full of ancient secrets", the literary popularity of Pan, the widespread belief that the majority of British had remained pagan long after the process of Christianisation, and the idea that folk customs represented pagan survivals.{{sfn|Hutton|1999|p=199}} At the same time, Hutton suggested, it seemed more plausible to many than the previously dominant rationalist idea that the witch trials were the result of mass delusion.{{sfn|Hutton|1999|p=199}} Related to this, folklorist [[Jacqueline Simpson]] suggested that part of the Murrayite theory's appeal was that it appeared to give a "sensible, demystifying, liberating approach to a longstanding but sterile argument" between the rationalists who denied that there had been any witches and those, like [[Montague Summers]], who insisted that there had been a real Satanic conspiracy against Christendom in the Early Modern period replete with witches with supernatural powers.{{sfn|Simpson|1994|p=90}} As [[Hilda Ellis Davidson]] noted; "how refreshing and exciting her first book was ''at that period''. A new approach, and such a surprising one."{{sfn|Simpson|1994|p=90}}

Nevertheless, Murray's theories never received support from experts in the Early Modern witch trials,{{sfn|Hutton|1999|p=198}} and from her early publications onward many of her ideas were challenged by those who highlighted her "factual errors and methodological failings".{{sfn|Eliade|1975|p=152}} Indeed, the majority of scholarly reviews of her work produced at the time were largely critical.{{sfn|Sheppard|2013|p=169}} George L. Burr critically reviewed both of her initial books on the subject for the ''[[American Historical Review]]''.{{sfnm|1a1=Burr|1y=1922|1pp=780&amp;ndash;783|2a1=Burr|2y=1935|2pp=491&amp;ndash;492}}  In his review of ''The Witch-Cult in Western Europe'' he asserted that she was not acquainted with the "careful general histories by modern scholars" and criticised her for assuming that the trial accounts accurately reflected the accused witches' genuine experiences of witchcraft, regardless of whether those confessions had been obtained through torture and coercion.{{sfn|Burr|1922|p=781}} He also charged her with selectively using the evidence to serve her interpretation, for instance by omitting any supernatural or miraculous events that appear in the trial accounts.{{sfn|Burr|1922|p=782}} As [[Pagan studies]] scholar Catherine Noble later put it, "Burr has hardly a kind word for Murray".{{sfn|Noble|2005|p=10}}

One of the foremost specialists of the trial records, L'Estrange Ewen, brought out a series of books specialising in the archival material which rejected Murray's ideas.{{sfn|Hutton|1999|p=198}} In 1938 Ewen launched a vociferous attack on Murray's scholarship, dismissing her theory as "vapid balderdash".&lt;ref&gt;C. L'Estrange Ewen (1938) ''Some Witchcraft Criticism: A Plea for the Blue Pencil''. London: C. L. Ewen.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, W.R. Halliday reviewed her work for the ''Folklore'' journal and exposed the flaws in her use of sources.{{sfn|Hutton|1999|p=198}} E. M. Loeb criticised her in his review of ''The Witch-Cult in Western Europe'' for ''[[American Anthropologist]]''.{{sfn|Loeb|1922|pp=476&amp;ndash;478}} In Noble's words, "There is no constructive criticism between peers here; it is a frontal attack on an author Loeb clearly believes has no place among published historians, at least on the topic of witchcraft."{{sfn|Noble|2005|p=11}}

In his 1962 work ''A Razor for a Goat'', Rose asserted that Murray's books on the witch-cult "contain an incredible number of minor errors of fact or of calculation and several inconsistencies of reasoning."{{sfn|Rose|1962|p=56}} He accepted that her case "could, perhaps, still be proved by somebody else, though I very much doubt it."{{sfn|Rose|1962|p=56}} Highlighting that there is a gap of about a thousand years between the Christianisation of Britain and the start of the witch trials there, he asserts that there is no evidence for the existence of the witch-cult anywhere in the intervening period.{{sfn|Rose|1962|pp=56&amp;ndash;57}} He further criticises her for treating pre-Christian Britain as a socially and culturally monolithic entity, whereas in reality it contained a diverse array of societies and religious beliefs. In addition to this, he challenged Murray's claim that the majority of Britons in the Middle Ages remained pagan as "a view grounded on ignorance alone".{{sfn|Rose|1962|pp=57&amp;ndash;61}}

Simpson noted that despite these critical reviews, within the field of British folkloristics Murray's theories were permitted "to pass unapproved but unchallenged, either out of politeness or because nobody was really interested enough to research the topic."{{sfn|Simpson|1994|p=94}} As evidence, she noted that no substantial research articles on the subject of witchcraft were published in the journal ''Folklore'' between Murray's in 1917 and [[Rossell Hope Robbins]]' in 1963.{{sfn|Simpson|1994|p=94}} However, she also highlighted that when regional studies of British folklore were published in this period by folklorists like [[Theo Brown]], [[Ruth Tongue]], or [[Enid Porter]], none adopted the Murrayite framework for interpreting witchcraft beliefs, thus evidencing her claim that Murray's theories were widely ignored by scholars of folklore.{{sfn|Simpson|1994|p=94}}

Murray did not respond directly to the criticisms of her work, but did react to her critics in a hostile manner; in later life she asserted that she eventually ceased reading reviews of her work, and believed that her critics were simply acting on religious prejudice.{{sfnm|1a1=Thomas|1y=1971|1p=516|2a1=Simpson|2y=1994|2p=90}} Noble later stated that Murray "repeatedly dismissed [her critics] in print as close-minded, bigoted, or uninformed."{{sfn|Noble|2005|p=5}}

===Academic reception: 1963–present===
Murray's work came to be increasingly criticised following her death in 1963, with the definitive academic rejection of the Murrayite witch-cult theory occurring during the 1970s.{{sfnm|1a1=Hutton|1y=1999|1p=362|2a1=Russell|2a2=Alexander|2y=2007|2p=154}} At this time, a variety of scholars across Europe and North America &amp;ndash; such as [[Alan Macfarlane]], Erik Midelfort, William Monter, Robert Muchembled, Gerhard Schormann, Bente Alver and Bengt Ankarloo &amp;ndash; began to publish in-depth studies of the archival records from the witch trials, leaving no doubt that those tried for witchcraft were not practitioners of a surviving pre-Christian religion.{{sfn|Hutton|1999|p=362}}

In his 1971 book ''Religion and the Decline of Magic'', English historian [[Keith Thomas (historian)|Keith Thomas]] dismissed Murray's thesis when he asserted that scholarship on the Early Modern witch trials had established that there was "very little evidence to suggest that the accused witches were either devil-worshippers or members of a pagan fertility cult".{{sfn|Thomas|1971|p=514}} Although accepting that when she first published her ideas, they were "the best alternative" to the dominant "rationalist" view of witchcraft as "total delusion", he stated that her conclusions were "almost totally groundless" because she ignored the systematic study of the trial accounts provided by Ewen and instead used sources very selectively to argue her point.{{sfn|Thomas|1971|p=515}} In his 1975 book ''[[Europe's Inner Demons]]'', English historian [[Norman Cohn]] commented on the "extraordinary" manner in which Murray's theory had come to "exercise considerable influence" within scholarship.{{sfn|Cohn|1975|p=107}} Cohn was nevertheless highly critical; he asserted that Murray's "knowledge of European history, even of English history, was superficial and her grasp of [[historical method]] was non-existent."{{sfn|Cohn|1975|p=109}} Furthermore, he added that her ideas were "firmly set in an exaggerated and distorted version of the Frazerian mould."{{sfn|Cohn|1975|p=109}} That same year, the Romanian historian of religion [[Mircea Eliade]], writing in the ''[[History of Religions]]'' journal, described Murray's work as "hopelessly inadequate" and full of "numberless and appalling errors". He added that from the perspective of a historian of religion, "her use of comparative materials and, in general, the methods of ''[[religious studies|Religionswissenschaft]]'' have been unfortunate."{{sfn|Eliade|1975|pp=152&amp;ndash;153}}

In 1994, the English folklorist [[Jacqueline Simpson]] devoted a paper in the ''Folklore'' journal to the subject of "Margaret Murray: Who Believed Her, and Why?".{{sfn|Simpson|1994}} She noted that the Murrayite theory was "based on deeply flawed methods and illogical arguments" and that the discipline of [[folkloristics]] had been damaged by its association with Murray, who had been appointed President of the [[Folklore Society]].{{sfn|Simpson|1994|p=89}} Simpson outlined how Murray had selected her use of evidence very specifically, particularly by ignoring and/or rationalising any accounts of supernatural or miraculous events in the trial records, thereby distorting the events that she was describing. Thus, Simpson pointed out, Murray rationalised claims that the cloven-hoofed Devil appeared at the witches' Sabbath by stating that he was a man with a special kind of shoe, and similarly asserted that witches' claims to have flown through the air on broomsticks were actually based on their practice of either hopping along on broomsticks or smearing hallucinogenic salves onto themselves.{{sfn|Simpson|1994|pp=90&amp;ndash;91}}

In 1996, historian [[Diane Purkiss]] asserted that Murray's thesis was "intrinsically improbable" and that it "commands little or no allegiance within the modern academy".{{sfn|Purkiss|1996|p=62}} She nevertheless felt that male scholars like Thomas, Cohn, and Macfarlane had committed "ritual slaughter" when setting up their own histories of witchcraft by condemning Murray's. In doing so, she identified a trend for them to contrast their own perceived methodologically sound and sceptical interpretations with Murray's "feminised belief" about the witch-cult, hence ignoring any theoretical considerations regarding the male-centric nature of their own perspectives.{{sfn|Purkiss|1996|pp=62&amp;ndash;63}}

In his 1999 book ''[[The Triumph of the Moon]]'', Hutton asserted that Murray had treated her source material with "reckless abandon",{{sfn|Hutton|1999|p=198}} in that she had taken "vivid details of alleged witch practices" from "sources scattered across a great extent of space and time" and then declared them to be normative of the cult as a whole.{{sfn|Hutton|1999|p=196}} Concurring with this assessment, historian Jeffrey B. Russell and Brooks Alexander stated that "Murray's use of sources in general is appalling".{{sfn|Russell|Alexander|2007|p=154}} They went on to assert that "Today, scholars are agreed that Murray was more than just wrong &amp;ndash; she was completely and embarrassingly wrong on nearly all of her basic premises."{{sfn|Russell|Alexander|2007|p=154}} In his sociological study of the Early Modern witchcraft, [[Gary Jensen]] highlighted that Murray's work had been "seriously challenged" and that it did not take into account "why it took so long for the heretic witch to be invented and targeted", noting that had the Murrayite witch-cult been a reality, then it would have been persecuted throughout the Medieval and not just in the Early Modern period.{{sfn|Jensen|2007|p=147}}

==Later writers==
During the 1930s and 1940s, [[Heinrich Himmler]] organised a branch of the [[SS]] to undertake the largest survey of witch-hunt trial records in Europe ever taken, with the dual aim of using it as anti-Christian propaganda, to claim that the inquisition had been a repression of an indigenous ''[[Völkisch movement|Völkisch]]'' Norse-Germanic nature religion, and as evidence for reconstructing that religion.&lt;ref&gt;Hans Sebald, "Nazi ideology redefining deviants: Witches, Himmler's witch-trial survey, and the case of the bishopric of Bamberg" in: Levack (ed.), ''New Perspectives on Witchcraft, Magic, and Demonology'' (2001), pp. 113ff.&lt;/ref&gt; This prompted Stuart Clark to dub the Nazi regime "Europe's first and only 'pro-witch' government."&lt;ref&gt;Clark, Stuart et al. ''The Period of the Witch Trials'' p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; One pamphlet, 1935's ''The Christian Witch-Craze'',&lt;ref&gt;Friederike Müller-Reimerdes. ''Der christliche Hexenwahn. Gedanken zum religiösen Freiheitskampf der deutschen Frau.''&lt;/ref&gt; claimed that the witch-hunts were an attempt to exterminate "Aryan womanhood".&lt;ref&gt;''Magic and Superstition in Europe'', [[Michael David Bailey]], Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers, Inc, 2006, pp. 236-238&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985 Classical historian [[Georg Luck]], in his ''Arcana Mundi: Magic and the Occult in the Greek and Roman Worlds'', theorised that the origins of the witch-cult may have appeared in late antiquity as a faith primarily designed to worship the Horned God, stemming from the merging of [[Cernunnos]], a horned god of the Celts, with the Greco-Roman [[Pan (god)|Pan]]/[[Faunus]],&lt;ref name="LuckArcana"&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Gerog Luck |last=Luck |first=Georg |year=1985 |title=Arcana Mundi: Magic and the Occult in the Greek and Roman Worlds: A Collection of Ancient Texts. |location=Baltimore, MD |publisher=[[Johns Hopkins University Press]] |pages=6–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; a combination of gods which he posits created a new deity, around which the remaining [[pagan]]s, those refusing to convert to Christianity, rallied and that this deity provided the prototype for later Christian conceptions of the [[Devil]], and his worshippers were cast by the Church as witches.&lt;ref name="LuckArcana" /&gt;

While Murray's theory had received some negative critical attention at the time of its first publication, it was not until the 1950s and 1960s that her books became best sellers, reaching a larger audience and thereby subsequently causing experts to decide that "the Murray thesis had to be stopped once and for all" .&lt;ref name="history.ac.uk"&gt;''The Witch in History: Early Modern and Twentieth-Century Representations.''

===Literature===
Simpson noted that the publication of the Murray thesis in the ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' made it accessible to "journalists, film-makers popular novelists and thriller writers", who adopted it "enthusiastically".{{sfn|Simpson|1994|p=89}} It influenced the work of [[Aldous Huxley]] and [[Robert Graves]].{{sfn|Simpson|1994|p=89}}

===Influence on occultism and contemporary Paganism===
The Murrayite thesis provided the blueprint for the contemporary Pagan religion of [[Wicca]].{{Sfn|Simpson|1994|p=89}}

In the 1950s, several British occultists claimed they had found remnants of the surviving Witch Cult. The first of these was [[Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)|Gerald Gardner]], who claimed to have discovered a coven of such witches - the [[New Forest Coven]], in 1939. Gardner said that he was concerned that the religion would die out, and so initiated more members into it through his [[Bricket Wood coven]]. The tradition that he started became [[Gardnerian Wicca]]. The New Forest witch [[Sybil Leek]] made a similar claim, stating that she followed the religion as many of her family had previously done, and a similar claim came from the Australian artist [[Rosaleen Norton]], whose family had been of [[Wales|Welsh]] origin. [[Charles Cardell]] also made the claim of a hereditary lineage of the witch-cult, and he posited that the horned deity of the witches was known as Atho. Other Britons soon made the claim that they were members of a long line of family Witches. [[Roy Bowers|Robert Cochrane]] made such a claim, and ran a coven called the [[Clan of Tubal Cain]]; he inspired the founding of several movements, including the [[1734 Tradition]]. [[Alex Sanders (Wiccan)|Alex Sanders]] also made such a claim, and founded [[Alexandrian Wicca]]; however, Sanders turned out to be a Gardnerian initiate and had based Alexandrian ritual on Gardnerian Wicca.&lt;ref&gt;Sanders, Maxine (2008) ''Firechild''; Hutton, Ronald (1999) ''Triumph of the Moon''.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1974 [[E.W. Lidell]] made the claim that the occultist [[Aleister Crowley]] had been initiated into the witch-cult in 1899 or 1900, after being introduced to it through [[Allan Bennett]], a [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn|Golden Dawn]] friend of his. Lidell continued his claim by saying that the coven's High Priestess expelled Crowley for being "a dirty minded, evilly disposed, vicious little monster". No substantiating evidence has, however, been produced for this.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ronald Hutton|Hutton, Ronald]], (1999), ''The Triumph of the Moon - A History of Modern Pagan Withcraft'', page 218, [[Oxford University Press]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Carlo Ginzburg and the ''benandanti''===
From the 1960s [[Carlo Ginzburg]] documented the beliefs of a number of early modern groups of sorcerers, seers and healers. He claimed they were rooted in pre-Christian paganism, and credited Murray with a "correct intuition" in identifying the remnants of a pre-Christian 'religion of Diana', and in believing that witch-trial testimonies did at times represent actual or perceived experiences.&lt;ref&gt;Ginzburg, Carlo (1990) ''Ecstasies: Deciphering the Witches' Sabbath''. London: Hutchinson Radius. p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;
In the original Italian preface to ''I benandanti'', published in 1966, Ginzburg discussed the work of Murray, claiming that although it contained "a kernel of truth", it had been "formulated in a wholly uncritical way", containing "serious defects".&lt;ref name="Ginzburg xix"&gt;[[#Gin83|Ginzburg 1983]]. p. xix .&lt;/ref&gt; With the complete academic rejection of Murray's theories in the 1970s, Ginzburg attempted to clarify his work's relationship to Murray's Witch-Cult theory in his "Preface to the English Edition", written in 1982. Here, he expressly stated that "Murray, in fact, asserted: (a) that witchcraft had its roots in an ancient fertility cult, and (b) that the sabbat described in the witchcraft trials referred to gatherings which had actually taken place. What my work really demonstrated, even if unintentionally, was simply the first point."&lt;ref name="Ginzburg xiii"&gt;[[#Gin83|Ginzburg 1983]]. p. xiii.&lt;/ref&gt; He added that although he rejected her ideas, there was a "kernel of truth" in Murray's thesis.&lt;ref name="Ginzburg xiii"/&gt;

Some historians have viewed Ginzburg's ideas as being related to Murray's; Hungarian historian Gábor Klaniczay stated that "Ginzburg reformulated Murray's often fantastic and very inadequately documented thesis about the reality of the witches' Sabbath" and thus the publication of ''I Benandanti'' in 1966 "reopened the debate about the possible interconnections between witchcraft beliefs and the survival of pagan fertility cults".{{sfn|Klaniczay|1990|p=132}} Similarly, Romanian historian of religion [[Mircea Eliade]] commented that while Ginzburg's presentation of the ''benandanti'' "does not substantiate Murray's entire thesis", it did represent a "well-documented case of the ''processus'' through which a popular and archaic secret cult of fertility is transformed into a merely magical, or even black-magical practice under the pressure of the Inquisition."{{sfn|Eliade|1975|pp=156&amp;ndash;157}} Historian of witchcraft Michael D. Bailey suggested that Ginzburg's work "somewhat revived" Murray's "discredited notion of witchcraft representing an ancient fertility religion".{{sfn|Bailey|2008|p=83}}

Conversely, other scholars drew a clear divide between the ideas of Murray and Ginzburg; in 1975, Cohn stated that Ginzburg's discovery had "nothing to do" with Murray's witch-cult hypothesis.{{sfn|Cohn|1975|p=223}} Echoing these views, in 1999 English historian [[Ronald Hutton]] stated that Ginzburg's ideas regarding shamanistic fertility cults were actually "pretty much the opposite" of what Murray had posited. Hutton pointed out that Ginzburg's argument that "ancient dream-worlds, or operations on non-material planes of consciousness, helped to create a new set of fantasies at the end of the Middle Ages" differed strongly from Murray's argument that an organised religion of witches had survived from the pre-Christian era and that descriptions of witches' sabbaths were accounts of real events.{{sfn|Hutton|1999|p=378}} The folklorist Juliette Wood stated that while Ginzburg articulated a "more sympathetic" stance to Murray's ideas than other specialists in the witch trials, he "does not propose anything approaching the pan-European cult which Murray advocated".{{sfn|Wood|2001|pp=46&amp;ndash;47}}
