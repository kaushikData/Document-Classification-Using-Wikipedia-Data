The '''Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians''' ('''AACM''') is a [[non-profit organization]], founded in 1965 in Chicago by pianist [[Muhal Richard Abrams]], pianist [[Jodie Christian]], drummer [[Steve McCall (drummer)|Steve McCall]], and composer [[Phil Cohran]].&lt;ref name="RCJE"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Cook| first = Richard| author-link =| year = 2005| title = Richard Cook's Jazz Encyclopedia| publisher = Penguin Books| location = London| isbn = 0-141-00646-3| page = 23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The AACM is devoted "to nurturing, performing, and recording serious, original music," according to its charter. It supports and encourages [[jazz]] performers, composers and educators. Although founded in the jazz tradition, the group's outreach and influence has, according to Larry Blumenfeld, "touched nearly all corners of modern music."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/free-at-first-the-audacious-journey-of-the-association-for-the-advancement-of-creative-musicians-review-1429654559|title='Free at First: The Audacious Journey of the Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians' Review|author=Blumenfeld, Larry |date=April 21, 2015|work=Wall Street Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
By the 1960s jazz music was losing ground to rock music and the founders of the AACM felt that a proactive group of musicians would add creativity and outlet for new music.&lt;ref name=Reich&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/music/reich/ct-jazz-aacm-20150127-column.html|title=50th anniversary of AACM celebrated at DuSable Museum|author=Reich, Howard|date=January 27, 2015|work=Chicago Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The AACM was formed in May 1965 by a group of musicians centered on [[pianist]] [[Muhal Richard Abrams]] who had organized an Experimental Band since 1962. The musicians were generally steadfast in their commitment to their music, despite a lack of performance venues and sometimes indifferent audiences. From 1969 the AACM organised a music education program for inner-city youths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Litweiler, John | title=The Freedom Principle: Jazz After 1958 | publisher=Da Capo | year=1984|isbn=0-306-80377-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1960s and 1970s AACM members were among the most important and innovative in all of jazz, though the AACM's contemporary influence has waned some in recent years.  Many AACM members have recorded widely: in the early days on the [[Delmark Records]] Avant Garde Jazz series and later on the [[Black Saint/Soul Note]] and [[India Navigation]] labels, and to a lesser extent on the [[Arista Records]] and [[ECM (record label)|ECM]] labels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.delmark.com/delmark.history.htm|title=Delmark History|work=delmark.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The musical endeavors of members of the AACM often include an adventurous mixing of avant-garde jazz, classical, and world music. The AACM also ran a school, The AACM School of Music, with classes in all areas taught by members of the AACM. The AACM also had a strong relationship with an influential sister organization, the [[Black Artists' Group]] (BAG) of [[St. Louis, Missouri]].  The AACM has received aid from the [[MacArthur Foundation]] and has a strong relationship with [[Columbia College Chicago|Columbia College]]. ''A Power Stronger Than Itself: The Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians'' by [[George Lewis (trombonist)|George Lewis]], has been published by the University of Chicago Press (May 2008).&lt;ref name="nyt_2008"&gt;{{Cite news | first = Nate | last=Chinen | title=Four Decades of Music That Redefined Free | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date=May 2, 2008 | accessdate=June 7, 2012 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/02/arts/music/02aacm.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, a 50-year retrospective exhibition of art, music and group-related artifacts, entitled, "Free at First", was held at the [[DuSable Museum of African American History]].&lt;ref name=Reich/&gt;

==Music==
The AACM has been on the forefront of the avant-garde since its inception in 1965. [[Anthony Braxton]], [[Henry Threadgill]], and the [[Art Ensemble of Chicago]] pushed the boundaries of jazz and challenged the avant-garde classical movement led by [[John Cage]]. Concerts were heavily improvised, and many AACM members created scores that blended music, geometry, painting, and ciphers to be interpreted by the performers live. The AACM was part of an artistic movement on the South Side of Chicago that included AFRICobra (African Commune of Bad Relevant Artists) and other collectives.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, George E..

'''Ayala Zacks-Abramov''' ({{lang-he|אילה זקס-אברמוב}}, 
1912 &amp;ndash; 30 August 2011) was an [[Israel]]i-[[Canadians|Canadian]]&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.artlyst.com/articles/canadas-peggy-guggenheim-ayala-zacksabramov-dies Canada's Peggy Guggenheim Ayala Zacks-Abramov Dies - ArtLyst]&lt;/ref&gt; [[art collector]]. Ayala was widowed three times, and was previously married to the Canadian art collector Samuel Jacob Zacks and to the knesset member [[Zalman Abramov]].

==Biography==
Zacks-Abramov was born in Jerusalem in 1912 as Ayala Ben-Tovim. Her parents, Shmuel Ben-Tovim and Rashe (née: Berman) were married in Jerusalem in 1902. She studied in London and in Paris where she met her first husband, Morris Fleg, whom she married in 1938.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

In 1940, during [[World War II]], he joined the [[French Resistance]] after Fleg enlisted to the army and was killed during a military operation.

In 1947, she married Samuel Zacks, a Canadian economist and art collector, whom she met during her stay in [[Switzerland]]. After marrying, the couple began to collect art items from the 19th century and the 20th century, mainly of French, Canadian and Israeli artists such as [[Gauguin]], [[Auguste Rodin|Rodin]], [[Picasso]], [[Henri Matisse]], [[Wassily Kandinsky|Kandinsky]] and [[Chagall]]. They also acquired art by Israeli artists such as [[Marcel Janco]], [[Mordechai Ardon]], [[Reuven Rubin]] and [[Anna Ticho]], and art of relatively unknown artists at the time of the purchase such as [[Ofer Lellouche]], [[Yigal Tumarkin]] and [[Joseph Zaritsky]].

In 1970, her husband Zacks died. She returned to Israel in 1976 and married Zalman Abramov, who was a lawyer and a Knesset member.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.co.il/gallery/1.1373523 מתה פטרונית האמנות אילה זקס אברמוב - גלריה - הארץ]&lt;/ref&gt; The couple were [[Patronage|patrons of the arts]], and Abramov continued to support the art world even after her husband's death in 1997.

Zachs-Abramov supported over the years the [[Tel Aviv Museum of Art]] and the [[Israel Museum]] and had a hand in their growth. Both the museums have halls named after her. She mentioned these museums in her will, in which she declared that her art collection would be divided between them.

The Israeli notable painter [[Joseph Zaritsky]] painted a well-known figurative portrait of her.

Many of the art works in Zachs-Abramov's possession were donated or loaned through to years to museums in Israel, France and Canada.

[[File:Beunans Meriasek (The life of St Meriasek) (f.56v.) Middle Cornish Saint's Play.jpg|thumb|Beunans Meriasek (f. 56 v.)]]
'''''Beunans Meriasek''''' ([[English language|English]]: ''The Life of Saint Meriasek'') is a [[Cornwall|Cornish]] play completed in 1504. Its subject is the legends of the life of Saint [[Meriasek]] or Meriadoc, patron saint of [[Camborne]], whose veneration was popular in Cornwall, [[Brittany]], and elsewhere. It was written in the [[Cornish language]],  probably written around the same time and in the same place as ''[[Bewnans Ke]]'', the only other extant Cornish play taking a saint's life as its subject.

The manuscript of Beunans Meriasek is held in the [[Peniarth Manuscripts|Peniarth Collection]] at the [[National Library of Wales]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kent|first1=Alan M.|title=The literature of Cornwall : continuity, identity, difference, 1000-2000|date=2000|publisher=Redcliffe Press|location=Bristol|isbn=1900178281|pages=285}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Outline==
The legend of [[Meriasek]], son of a [[Duke of Brittany]], who, for love of the [[priest]]ly profession, refused marriage with a wealthy princess and led the life of a miracle-working [[hermit]], first in [[Cornwall]] and afterwards in [[Brittany|his native land]]; the legend of [[Pope Sylvester I|Saint Sylvester]], who healed the emperor [[Constantine the Great]] of [[leprosy]] by a dip in the [[baptismal font]], and then aided him in establishing [[Christianity]] throughout his broad dominion; and the curious legend of a mother who, on the [[Virgin Mary|Virgin]]'s continued disregard of her [[prayer]] for the deliverance of a son in [[Hostage|captivity]], carried off the [[Christ Child]] from the arms of the Virgin's statue, and refused to yield up the baby to the Madonna until her own son was restored to her.&lt;ref&gt;[[Katharine Lee Bates|Bates, K.

== Plot ==
Three girls, a down-and-out [[stripper]] named Trixie, a drug-running killer and [[ex-convict]] named Camero, and a corporate powerbroker nicknamed Hel, arrive at a remote desert hideaway to extort massive riches from a ruthless sword-wielding killer named Pinky, who is also a notorious underworld figure. None of the three women is who they appear to be: each has an ulterior motive.

They kidnap a gangster called Gage and try to force him to reveal where the treasure is buried. He refuses, believing they will kill him anyway, but Hel promises he will not be harmed. Camero shoots him, against the wishes of Hel, saying she made no such promise. His phone rings, and they believe Gage is connected to Pinky.

Things become more complicated when a police officer named Deputy Fuchs arrives. Unknown to them, he was in the audience five nights ago when Trixie performed as a stripper to seduce Gage. However, the three women hide the body and are able to convince Fuchs to leave.  While digging for the treasure, Camero asks the girls about the best sex each has ever had, believing the answer tells her something important about their character. She admits her best sex ever was with a circus [[contortionist]], although she did not even know the contortionist's name.

During a water fight, Trixie falls onto something in the sand.  They dig; however, instead of buried treasure they find the dead body of one of Hel's contacts. Trixie goes into the trailer to collect herself as Hel follows her to check on her, only for Trixie to seduce Hel into kissing her, which leads to them having sex until Camero catches them in the act. They are interrupted by Hot Wire and his girlfriend Kinki, whom Camero is familiar with. At gunpoint, the two abuse the women and force them to dig for the buried treasure. Deputy Fuchs returns and attempts to save the women, but instead creates a gunfight, which Hel ends with a high-powered machine gun found in the nearby trailer.

Camero asks the meaning of the code Hel uses on the bunker "75650". 
At closer inspection it appears that the number 1 is associated with the letter A, 2 with BCD, 3 with E, 4 is with FGH, 5 is with IJK, 6 is with LMN, 7 is with OPQ, 8 is with RST, 9 is with UVW and 0 is with XYZ.
With this info the code numbers spell "PINKY" 
Hel and Trixie find a concealed bunker full of goods stolen from Pinky, including a mysterious weapon, diamonds, and a beautiful sword, which Trixie takes. Camero, believing she is in the midst of a double-cross, fights Hel for the diamonds. Camero overcomes Hel and sets Trixie afire along with barrels of flammable liquids. Camero leaves Hel in chains while she attempts to drive away with the diamonds; however, Hel quickly uses the super-machine gun to free herself, and fires a rocket that destroys the car Camero was driving.

Hel admits to Trixie that she is a secret agent who reports to a man named Phoenix, and that she is on a mission to retrieve the weapon they found in Pinky's lair. Camero returns and again fights Hel. After she beats Hel to the ground, Camero assumes she is dead and moves to kill Trixie. As Trixie will not fight back, Camero attempts to rape her, but stops when she sees a tattoo and realizes Trixie was the mysterious contortionist from her past. Before she can kill Trixie, Camero is shot in the back and killed by Deputy Fuchs, who managed to survive the explosion. However, instead of thanking him, Trixie kills Fuchs using a hidden [[Shuriken|throwing star]]. Hel awakens, having survived Camero's attack. Trixie then reveals that she, in fact, is Pinky, and concocted the entire plot to retrieve the sword she took from Gage's bunker, which he had taken from her six months previously.

==Inspiration==
The film is described as "a post-modern, thinking man's throwback to the 'B' Movie/Exploitation films of the 1950s–70s as well as a loving, sly parody of the same".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url = http://www.cinematical.com/2008/07/22/sdcc-exclusive-bitch-slap-poster-and-photos| title= SDCC Exclusive: 'Bitch Slap' Poster and Photos| last= Davis |first= Erik| date= 2008-07-22| work= Cinematical | accessdate=2008-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film is inspired by the ''[[Dragstrip Girl]]'', ''[[Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill!]]'', ''[[Kung Fu Nun]]'', the pantheon of [[blaxploitation]] and other [[exploitation films]] which had a renewal in popularity after the cult success of ''[[Grindhouse (film)|Grindhouse]]'' in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/18199| title = Bloodied Hot Babes in New 'Bitch Slap' Photos}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Boston Modern Orchestra Project''' (BMOP) is a professional [[orchestra]] in [[Boston, Massachusetts]].

Founded in 1996 by artistic director [[Gil Rose]], its mission is to explore the connections between contemporary music and contemporary society by reuniting composers and audiences in a shared concert experience. In its first twelve seasons, BMOP performed over 80 concerts of contemporary orchestral music, commissioned more than 20 works and presented over 70 world premieres, released 20 CDs, produced the inaugural Ditson Festival of Contemporary Music with the [[Institute of Contemporary Art, Boston]], and collaborated to produce performances of contemporary operas (including the Opera Unlimited festival of contemporary chamber opera). Now entering its 20th season, it has released nearly 50 CDs in total. BMOP performs regularly at Boston's [[Jordan Hall]], and has performed in major venues on both the [[East Coast of the United States|East]] and [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]]s of the United States. BMOP has appeared at [[Tanglewood]], the Festival of New American Music in Sacramento, California, and Pittsburgh's "Music on the Edge" festival.

The orchestra has won the [[ASCAP]] Award for Adventurous Programming of Orchestral Music and recipient of the John S. Edwards Award for Strongest Commitment to New American Music.&lt;ref&gt;[ASCAP Orchestra Awards 2009 http://www.ascap.com/press/2009/0611_orchestra_awards.aspx]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[ASCAP Orchestra Awards 2010 http://www.ascap.com/press/2010/0618_Orchestra-Awards.aspx]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015 it was named Musical America's 2016 Ensemble of the Year, the first ever symphony orchestra to receive the award.&lt;ref name="musical america 2015"&gt;{{cite news |last=Elliott |first=Susan |url=http://www.musicalamerica.com/news/newsstory.cfm?storyid=34958&amp;categoryid=2&amp;archived=0 |title=Musical America announces 2016 Artists of the Year |work=Musical America Worldwide |date=2015-10-14 |accessdate=2015-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, BMOP launched its record label, BMOP/sound, with John Harbison’s ballet "Ulysses". Its composer-centric releases focus on orchestral works that are otherwise unavailable in recorded form. Its five inaugural releases appeared on the "Best of 2008" lists of [[The New York Times]], [[The Boston Globe]], [[National Public Radio]], [[Time Out (company)|Time Out]] New York, [[Down Beat]] magazine, and American Record Guide.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/ref/arts/2008holidayclassical.html "2008 Holiday Gift Guide: Best Classical CDs]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://newyork.timeout.com/articles/opera-classical/69919/classical-the-best-and-worst-of-2008 "Classical: The best (and worst) of 2008"]&lt;/ref&gt; BMOP/sound has received two Grammy award nominations: in 2009 for its recording of [[Charles Fussell]]’s ''Wilde'' symphony for baritone and orchestra ([[Sanford Sylvan]] Best Classical Vocal Performance), and in 2010 for its recording of Derek Bermel's "Voices" for solo clarinet and orchestra (Best Instrumental Soloist Performance with Orchestra). [[The New York Times]] proclaimed, “BMOP/sound is an example of everything done right."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/21/arts/music/21stev.html?_r=1&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=Independent%20Labels%20Embrace%20a%20D.I.Y.%20Ethos&amp;st=cse Steve Smith, ''Independent Labels Embrace a D.I.Y. Ethos'', The New York Times, 21 December 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; 

BMOP has hosted a Composer in Residence each season since 2000. In recognition of the importance of this position, [[Meet the Composer]] and the [[League of American Orchestras]] awarded BMOP one of six three-year Music Alive grants for a collaboration with composer Lisa Bielawa.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.berkshirefinearts.com/index.php?page=article&amp;article_id=1082&amp;catID=8 Erica H. Adams, ''Boston Modern Orchestra Project (BMOP) Enlivens Audiences and Completes 12th Season with Five World Premieres'', BerkshireFineArts.com, 25 May 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The New York Times]] said in 2000: "Mr. Rose and his team filled the music with rich, decisive ensemble colors and magnificent solos. These musicians were rapturous - superb instrumentalists at work and play."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2000/03/30/arts/music-review-poetry-in-songs-reflecting-sun-and-moon.html Paul Griffiths, ''Poetry in Songs Reflecting Sun and Moon'', The New York Times, 30 March 2000]&lt;/ref&gt; Composer [[John Harbison]] has said that “No other city has anything resembling BMOP — with that level of activity, with that sustained productivity ... There’s really been no new-music organization with a wider range of inclusion.”&lt;ref name="boston globe 2015-10-15"&gt;{{cite news |last=Weininger |first=David |url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/arts/2015/10/15/gil-rose-bmop-celebrate-years-audacity-excellence/lq3j6VLAfNOjaWLkTnBBhJ/story.html |title=Gil Rose, BMOP celebrate 20 years of audacity, excellence |work=[[Boston Globe]] |location=Boston, Mass. |date=2015-10-15 |accessdate=2015-10-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Brief Interviews with Hideous Men''''' (1999) is a collection of 23 short stories by American writer [[David Foster Wallace]]. Four of the stories are entitled "Brief Interviews with Hideous Men" and are presented as transcripts of interviews with male subjects. The interviewer's questions are omitted from the transcripts, rendered merely as "Q." These stories and the rest of the collection are characterized by dark dry humor, alienation, and unconventional sexuality.

In 1997 Wallace was awarded the [[Aga Khan Prize for Fiction]] by editors of'' [[The Paris Review]]'' for "Brief Interviews with Hideous Men #6", which had appeared in the magazine and appears as "Brief Interviews with Hideous Men #20" in the collection.

Twelve of the "Interviews" were adapted into a stage play (''Hideous Men'') by [[Dylan McCullough]] in 2000, marking the first theatrical adaptation of any of Wallace's works. McCullough directed the premiere at the New York International Fringe Festival in August 2000.

In August 2012 British artists [[Andy Holden (artist)|Andy Holden]] and [http://www.davidraymondconroy.co.uk/ David Raymond Conroy] presented a stage adaptation of the book at the [[Institute of Contemporary Arts|ICA]], London,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ica.org.uk/blog/andy-holden-and-david-raymond-conroy-conversation-anna-gritz&lt;/ref&gt; which later toured to [[Arnolfini]], Bristol.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.arnolfini.org.uk/whatson/brief-interviews-with-hideous-men&lt;/ref&gt; The production used a variety of multimedia techniques such as projection of the letter 'Q' on a backdrop that disrupted the monologues and a system of ear-pieces and auto-cues to convey the script to the actors on stage. The adaptation used four of the interviews and one short story and contained new music by [[Andy Holden (artist)|the Grubby Mitts.]]

21 of the interviews and stories were adapted and directed by David McGuff for Yellow Lab Productions entitled "Brief Interviews with Hideous Men." The production ran three nights, August 28–30, 2014, at the Hill Country Arts Foundation's Point Theater on the Elizabeth Huth Coates indoor stage.

[[John Krasinski]] adapted and directed [[Brief Interviews with Hideous Men (film)|a film version]] on the "Brief Interviews" stories that was released in 2009. [[Julianne Nicholson]] plays Sara Quinn, the interviewer unnamed in the stories.

Cellachy held the post of [[Chief Ollam of Ireland]] and died in 1079. His obit is given in the [[Annals of the Four Masters]] as follows- "M1079.4 Ceallach Ua Ruanadha, chief poet of Ireland in his time, died."

His obituary is given in the [[Annals of Ulster]] as follows- "U1079.1 Cellach ua Ruanada, chief ollav of Ireland, rested in peace."

His obituary is given in the [[Chronicon Scotorum]] as follows- "Annal CS1079 Kalends. Cellach ua Ruanadha, ollamh of Ireland, dies."

An Irish clavis or metrical tract has been preserved in the [[Book of Leinster]] as well as in the eighteenth-century manuscript [[Trinity College, Dublin|Trinity College]] H 1 15, where it was copied from a fourteenth-century exemplar that seems now to be lost. [[Rudolf Thurneysen]] incorporated this poem in his Mittelirische Verslehren as Verslehre IV. In the [[Book of Leinster]] it was ascribed to a certain Cellach .h. Ruan, who may be identical with Cellach hua Ruanada.

Chanel S.A. is a [[Fashion design|high fashion house]] that specializes only in women's [[haute couture]] and [[ready-to-wear]] clothes, [[luxury goods]], and fashion accessories.&lt;ref name="directory"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fashionmodeldirectory.com/designers/gabrielle-chanel/|title=Chanel|publisher=Fashion Model Directory|accessdate=19 June 2008|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101027111919/http://www.fashionmodeldirectory.com/designers/gabrielle-chanel/|archivedate=27 October 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her youth, Gabrielle Chanel gained the nickname ''Coco'' from her time as a chanteuse. As a fashion designer, [[Coco Chanel]] catered to women's taste for elegance in dress, with blouses and suits, trousers and dresses, and [[jewellery]] ([[gemstone]] and [[bijouterie]]) of simple design, that replaced the opulent, over-designed, and constrictive clothes and accessories of 19th-century fashion. The Chanel product brands have been personified by fashion models and actresses, including [[Inès de La Fressange]], [[Catherine Deneuve]], [[Carole Bouquet]], [[Vanessa Paradis]], [[Nicole Kidman]], [[Anna Mouglalis]], [[Audrey Tautou]], [[Keira Knightley]],  [[Kristen Stewart]] and [[Marilyn Monroe]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/beauty/chanels-new-face-audrey-tautou/2008/05/07/1209839712295.html | work=The Age | location=Australia | first=Mindy | last=Laube | title=Chanel's new face: Audrey Tautou | date=7 May 2008 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080510083207/http://www.theage.com.au/news/beauty/chanels-new-face-audrey-tautou/2008/05/07/1209839712295.html | archivedate=10 May 2008 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The House of Chanel is known for the "[[little black dress]]", the [[perfume]] [[Chanel No. 5|No. 5 de Chanel]], and the Chanel Suit. Chanel's use of [[Jersey (fabric)|jersey]] fabric produced garments that were comfortable and affordable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/chnl/hd_chnl.htm | location=New York | work=Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History, The Metropolitan Museum of Art | title=Gabrielle "Coco" Chanel (1883–1971) and the House of Chanel | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161101043217/http://www.metmuseum.org/TOAH/hd/chnl/hd_chnl.htm | archivedate=1 November 2016 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Chanel revolutionized fashion — high fashion (haute couture) and everyday fashion (prêt-à-porter) — by replacing structured-silhouettes, based upon the [[corset]] and the [[bodice]], with garments that were functional and at the same time flattering to the woman's figure.

In the 1920s, the simple-line designs of Chanel couture made popular the "flat-chested" fashions that were the opposite of the hourglass-figure achieved by the fashions of the late 19th century — the [[Belle Époque]] of France (ca. 1890–1914), and the British [[Edwardian era]] (ca. 1901–1919). Chanel used colors traditionally associated with masculinity in Europe, such as [[grey]] and [[navy blue]], to denote feminine boldness of character.&lt;ref name="ContemporaryFashion"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Costume", pg. 52, [[Eyewitness Books]].''&lt;/ref&gt; The clothes of the House of Chanel featured quilted fabric and leather trimmings; the [[Quilting|quilted]] construction reinforces the fabric, the design, and the finish, producing a garment that maintains its form and function while being worn. An example of such haute couture techniques is the [[Worsted|woolen]] Chanel suit — a knee-length skirt and a cardigan-style jacket, trimmed and decorated with black [[embroidery]] and gold-coloured buttons. The complementary accessories were two-tone [[Court shoe|pump]] shoes and jewellry, usually a necklace of pearls, and a leather [[Chanel 2.55|handbag]].&lt;ref name="directory"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ContemporaryFashion"/&gt;&lt;ref name="funding"/&gt;

==History==

===The Coco Chanel era===
[[File:Coco Chanel, 1920.jpg|thumb|Gabrielle "Coco" Chanel in 1920]]
;Establishment and recognition — 1909–1920s
[[File:Chanel hat from Les Modes 1912.jpg|thumb|The actress Gabrielle Dorziat wearing a Chanel plumed hat (1912)]]
The '''House of Chanel''' (Chanel S.A.) originated in 1909 when Gabrielle Chanel opened a [[millinery]] shop at 160 Boulevard Malesherbes, the ground floor of the Parisian flat of the [[socialite]] and textile businessman [[Étienne Balsan]], of whom she was the mistress.&lt;ref name="directory"/&gt; Because the Balsan flat also was a [[Salon (gathering)|salon]] for the French hunting and sporting élite, Chanel had the opportunity to meet their ''[[Demimonde|demi-mondaine]]'' mistresses, who, as such, were women of fashion, upon whom the rich men displayed their wealth — as ornate clothes, [[jewelry]], and hats.

Coco Chanel thus could sell to them the hats she designed and made; she thus earned a living, independent of her financial sponsor, the socialite Balsan. In the course of those salons Coco Chanel befriended [[Boy Capel|Arthur 'Boy' Capel]], an English socialite and [[Polo|polo player]] friend of Étienne Balsan; per the [[upper class]] [[Convention (norm)|social custom]], Chanel also became mistress to Boy Capel. Despite that social circumstance, Boy Capel perceived the businesswoman innate to Coco Chanel, and, in 1910, financed her first independent millinery shop, ''Chanel Modes'', at 21 rue Cambon, Paris. Because that locale already housed a dress shop, the business-lease limited Chanel to selling only millinery products, not [[haute couture|couture]]. Two years later, in 1913, the [[Deauville]] and [[Biarritz]] couture shops of Coco Chanel offered for sale ''[[Ready to wear|prêt-à-porter]]'' sports clothes for women, the practical designs of which allowed the wearer to play sport.&lt;ref name="directory"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ContemporaryFashion"&gt;{{cite book
|author=Martin, Richard|title=Contemporary fashion|publisher=St. James Press|location=London|year=1995|pages=750|isbn=1-55862-173-3|oclc=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[World War I|First World War]] (1914–18) affected European [[fashion]] through scarcity of materials, and the mobilisation of women. By that time, Chanel had opened a large dress shop at 31 rue Cambon, near the [[Hôtel Ritz Paris|Hôtel Ritz]], in Paris; among the clothes for sale were [[flannel]] [[blazer]]s, straight-line skirts of [[linen]], [[sailor suit|sailor blouses]], long [[sweater]]s made of [[Jersey (fabric)|jersey]] fabric, and skirt-and-jacket suits.

Coco Chanel used jersey cloth because of its physical properties as a garment, such as its drape — how it falls upon and falls from the body of the woman — and how well it adapted to a simple garment-design. Sartorially, some of Chanel's designs derived from the military uniforms made prevalent by the War; and, by 1915, the designs and the clothes produced by the House of Chanel were known throughout France.&lt;ref name="directory"/&gt;

In 1915 and in 1917, ''[[Harper's Bazaar]]'' magazine reported that the garments of the House of Chanel were "on the list of every buyer" for the clothing factories of Europe.&lt;ref name="directory"/&gt; The Chanel dress shop at 31 rue Cambon presented day-wear dress-and-coat ensembles of simple design, and black evening dresses trimmed with [[lace]]; and [[tulle netting|tulle-fabric]] dresses decorated with [[Jet (lignite)|jet]], a minor gemstone material.&lt;ref name="directory"/&gt;

After the First World War, the House of Chanel, following the fashion trends of the 1920s, produced beaded dresses, made especially popular by the [[Flapper]] woman.&lt;ref name="directory"/&gt; By 1920, Chanel had designed and presented a woman's suit of clothes — composed either of two garments or of three garments — which allowed a woman to have a modern, feminine  appearance, whilst being comfortable and practical to maintain; advocated as the "new uniform for afternoon and evening", it became known as the '''Chanel Suit'''.

In 1921, to complement the suit of clothes, Coco Chanel commissioned the [[perfumer]] [[Ernest Beaux]] to create a perfume for the House of Chanel, his perfumes included the [[perfume]] [[Chanel No. 5|No.5]], named after the number of the sample Chanel liked best. Originally, a bottle of No. 5 de Chanel was a gift to clients of Chanel. The popularity of the perfume prompted the House of Chanel to offer it for retail sale in 1922.

In 1923, to explain the success of her clothes, Coco Chanel told ''Harper's Bazaar'' magazine that design "simplicity is the keynote of all true elegance."&lt;ref name="directory"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,858285-2,00.html | work=Time | title=BUSINESS ABROAD: King of Perfume | date=14 September 1953 | accessdate=28 April 2010 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100710144413/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,858285-2,00.html | archivedate=10 July 2010 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Business partners — late 1920s
The success of the [[Chanel No. 5|No. 5]] encouraged Coco Chanel to expand [[perfume]] sales beyond France and Europe and to develop other perfumes — for which she required investment capital, business acumen, and access to the North American market. To that end, the businessman [[Théophile Bader]] (founder of [[Galeries Lafayette]]) introduced the [[venture capital]]ist [[Pierre Wertheimer]] to Coco Chanel. Their business deal established the '''Parfums Chanel''' company, a ''parfumerie'' of which Wertheimer owned 70 per cent, Bader owned 20 per cent, and Chanel owned 10 per cent; commercial success of the joint enterprise was assured by the Chanel name, and by the cachet of la "Maison Chanel", which remained the sole business province of Coco Chanel.&lt;ref name="funding"/&gt;

Nonetheless, despite the success of the Chanel couture and ''parfumerie'', the personal relations between Coco and her capitalist partner deteriorated, because, Coco said that Pierre Wertheimer was exploiting her talents as a [[fashion design]]er and as a businesswoman.&lt;ref name="funding"/&gt; Wertheimer reminded Chanel that he had made her a very rich woman; and that his venture capital had funded Chanel's productive expansion of the ''parfumerie'' which created the wealth they enjoyed, all from the success of No. 5 de Chanel.

Nevertheless, unsatisfied, the businesswoman Gabrielle Chanel hired the attorney [[René de Chambrun]] to renegotiate the 10-per-cent partnership she entered, in 1924, with the Parfums Chanel company; the lawyer-to-lawyer negotiations failed, and the partnership-percentages remained as established in the original business deal among Wertheimer, Badel, and Chanel.&lt;ref name="funding"/&gt;

;Elegance and the war — 1930s–1940s
From the [[gamine]] fashions of the 1920s, Coco Chanel had progressed to womanly fashions in the 1930s: evening-dress designs were characterised by an elongated feminine style, and summer dresses featured contrasts such as silver eyelets, and shoulder straps decorated with [[rhinestone]]s - drawing from Renaissance-time fashion stylings. In 1932, Chanel presented an exhibition of [[jewelry]] dedicated to the [[diamond]] as a fashion accessory; it featured the ''Comet'' and ''Fountain'' necklaces of diamonds, which were of such original design, that Chanel S.A. re-presented them in 1993. Moreover, by 1937, the House of Chanel had expanded the range of its clothes to more women and presented ''prêt-à-porter'' clothes designed and cut for the petite woman.&lt;ref name="directory"/&gt; Among [[fashion designer]]s, only the clothes created by  [[Elsa Schiaparelli]] could compete with the clothes of Chanel.&lt;ref name="directory"/&gt;

[[Image:Bundesarchiv Bild 101III-Alber-178-04A, Walter Schellenberg.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Chanel's spymaster:&lt;br&gt;General Walter Schellenberg&lt;br&gt; Chief of the ''Sicherheitsdienst''.]]
During the [[World War II|Second World War]] (1939–45), Coco Chanel closed shop at Maison Chanel — leaving only jewellry and ''parfumerie'' for sale — and moved to the [[Hôtel Ritz Paris]], where she lived with her boyfriend, [[Hans Günther von Dincklage]], a Nazi intelligence officer.&lt;ref name="directory"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ContemporaryFashion"/&gt;&lt;ref name="funding"/&gt; Upon conquering France in June 1940, the Nazis established a Parisian occupation-headquarters in the [[Hôtel Meurice]], on the rue de la Rivoli, opposite the [[Musée du Louvre|Louvre Museum]], and just around the corner from the fashionable Maison Chanel S.A., at 31 rue Cambon.&lt;ref name="directory"/&gt;

Meanwhile, because of the Nazi occupation's official anti-Semitism, Pierre Wertheimer and family, had fled France to the U.S., in mid-1940. Later, in 1941, Coco Chanel attempted to assume business control of Parfums Chanel but was thwarted by an administrative [[delegation]] that disallowed her sole disposition of the ''parfumerie''. Having foreseen the Nazi occupation policy of the seizure-and-expropriation to Germany of Jewish business and assets in France, Pierre Wertheimer, the majority partner, had earlier, in May 1940, designated Felix Amiot, a Christian French industrialist, as the "[[Arianism|Aryan]]" [[Proxy voting|proxy]] whose legal control of the Parfums Chanel business proved politically acceptable to the Nazis, who then allowed the perfume company to continue as an operating business.&lt;ref name="funding"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mazzeo, Tilar J. ''The Secret of Chanel No. 5'' HarperCollins 2010, p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt;

Occupied France abounded with rumours that Coco Chanel was a Nazi [[collaborationism|collaborator]]; her clandestine identity was secret agent 7124 of the [[Abwehr]], code-named "Westminster".&lt;ref name="The New Yorker-McAuley"&gt;{{cite journal |last=McAuley |first=James |url=http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/books/2011/09/the-exchange-coco-chanel.html |title=The Exchange: Coco Chanel and the Nazi Party |journal=The New Yorker |date=1 September 2011 |accessdate=4 September 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111026072343/http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/books/2011/09/the-exchange-coco-chanel.html |archivedate=26 October 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, by order of General [[Walter Schellenberg]], of the ''[[Sicherheitsdienst]]'', Chanel was despatched to London on a mission to communicate to British Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] the particulars of a "separate peace" plan proposed by ''[[Reichsführer-SS]]'' [[Heinrich Himmler]], who sought to avoid surrendering to the [[Red Army]] of the Soviet Russians.

At War's end, upon the Allied liberation of France, Chanel was arrested for having collaborated with the Nazis. In September 1944, the [[Free French]] Purge Committee, the ''épuration'', summoned Chanel for interrogation about her collaborationism, yet, without documentary evidence of or witnesses to her collaboration with the Nazis, and because of Churchill's secret intervention in her behalf, the ''épuration'' released Coco Chanel from arrest as a traitor to France.&lt;ref name="funding"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vaughan, Hal. ''Sleeping with the Enemy: Coco Chanel's Secret War'' Alfred A. Knopf. 2011 pp. 186–87&lt;/ref&gt; Despite having been freed by the political grace of Churchill, the strength of the rumours of Chanel's Nazi collaboration had made it not possible for her to remain in France; so Coco Chanel and her German lover, Hans Günther von Dincklage, went into an eight-year exile to Switzerland.&lt;ref name="directory"/&gt;&lt;ref name="funding"/&gt;

In the post–war period, during Coco Chanel's Swiss exile from France, Pierre Wertheimer returned to Paris and regained formal administrative control of his family's business holdings — including control of Parfums Chanel, the ''parfumerie'' established with his venture capital, and successful because of the Chanel name.&lt;ref name="funding"/&gt;

In Switzerland, the news revived Coco Chanel's resentment at having been exploited by her business partner, for only ten per cent of the money. So she established a rival Swiss ''parfumerie'' to create, produce, and sell ''her'' "Chanel perfumes". In turn, Wertheimer, the majority [[capital stock]] owner of Parfums Chanel, saw his business interests threatened, and his commercial rights infringed because he did not possess legally exclusive rights to the Chanel name. Nonetheless, Wertheimer avoided a [[trademark]] infringement [[lawsuit]] against Coco Chanel, lest it damages the commercial reputation and the [[perfumer|artistic credibility]] of ''his'' Chanel-brand ''parfumerie''.

Wisely, Pierre Wertheimer settled his business- and commercial-rights quarrel with Chanel, and, in May 1947, they renegotiated the 1924 contract that had established Parfums Chanel — she was paid $400,000 in cash (wartime profits from the sales of perfume No. 5 de Chanel); assigned a 2.0 per cent [[Royalties|running royalty]] from the sales of No. 5 ''parfumerie''; assigned limited commercial rights to sell ''her'' "Chanel perfumes" in Switzerland; and granted a perpetual monthly [[stipend]] that paid all of her expenses. In exchange, Gabrielle Chanel closed her Swiss ''parfumerie'' enterprise, and sold to Parfums Chanel the full rights to the name "Coco Chanel".&lt;ref name="funding"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mazzeo, Tilar J. ''The Secret of Chanel No. 5'', pp. 176–77.&lt;/ref&gt;

;Resurgence — 1950s–1970s
[[File:1965 purple Chanel suit.jpg|thumb|250px|A classic Chanel suit, 1965]]

In 1953, upon returning to France from Switzerland, Coco Chanel  found the fashion business enamoured of the "[[Christian Dior S.A.|New Look]]" (1947), by [[Christian Dior]]; the signature shape featured a below-mid-calf-length, full-skirt, a narrow waist, and a large bust (stylistically absent since 1912). As a post–War fashion that used some 20 yards of fabric, the [[Christian Dior S.A.|House of Dior]] couture renounced wartime rationing of fabric for clothes.&lt;ref name="funding"/&gt;

In 1947 — after the six-year austerities of the [[Second World War]] (1939–45) — the New Look was welcomed by the fashion business of Western Europe because sales of the pretty clothes would revive business and the economy.&lt;ref name="directory"/&gt;&lt;ref name="directory"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://orderofsplendor.blogspot.com/2012/02/flashback-friday-fabulous-princess.html|title=The Royal Order of Sartorial Splendor: Flashback Friday: The Fabulous Princess Margaret|author=|date=10 February 2012|website=orderofsplendor.blogspot.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302080813/http://orderofsplendor.blogspot.com/2012/02/flashback-friday-fabulous-princess.html|archivedate=2 March 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To regain the business primacy of the House of Chanel, in the fashion fields of ''[[haute couture]]'', ''[[prêt-à-porter]]'', [[costume jewelry]], and ''[[perfume|parfumerie]]'', would be expensive; so Chanel approached Pierre Wertheimer for business advice and capital.&lt;ref name="funding"/&gt; Having decided to do business with Coco Chanel, Wertheimer's negotiations to fund the resurgence of the House of Chanel, granted him commercial rights to all Chanel-brand products.&lt;ref name="funding"/&gt;&lt;ref name="funding"/&gt;

In 1953, Chanel collaborated with jeweler [[Robert Goossens]]; he was to design jewelry (bijouterie and gemstone) to complement the fashions of the House of Chanel; notably, long-strand necklaces of black pearls and of white pearls, which high contrast softened the severe design of the knitted-wool Chanel Suit (skirt and cardigan jacket).&lt;ref name="ContemporaryFashion"/&gt;

The House of Chanel also presented leather handbags with either gold-colour chains or metal-and-leather chains, which allowed carrying the handbag from the shoulder or in hand. The quilted-leather handbag was presented to the public in February 1955. In-house, the numeric version of the launching date "2.55" for that line of handbags became the internal "appellation" for that model of the quilted-leather handbag.&lt;ref name="directory"/&gt;

Throughout the 1950s, the sense of style of Chanel continued undeterred; the firm's initial venture into masculine ''parfumerie'', Pour Monsieur was a successful ''[[eau de toilette]]'' for men. Chanel and her spring collection received the [[Fashion Oscar]] at the 1957 Fashion Awards in Dallas. Pierre Wertheimer bought Bader's 20 per cent share of the Parfums Chanel, which increased the Wertheimer percentage to 90 per cent.&lt;ref name="funding"/&gt;

Later, in 1965, Pierre's son, [[Jacques Wertheimer]], assumed his father's management of the ''parfumerie''.&lt;ref name="funding"/&gt; About the past business relationship, between Pierre Wertheimer and Coco Chanel, the Chanel attorney, Chambrun said that it had been "one based on a businessman's passion, despite her misplaced feelings of exploitation . . . [thus] when Pierre returned to Paris, full of pride and excitement [after one of his horses won the 1956 English Derby]. He rushed to Coco, expecting congratulations and praise. But she refused to kiss him. She resented him, you see, all her life."&lt;ref name="funding"/&gt;&lt;ref name="funding"/&gt;

Coco Chanel died on 10 January 1971, at the age of 87.&lt;ref name="directory"/&gt; She was still designing at the time of her death.&lt;ref name="directory"/&gt; For example, in the (1966–1969) period, she designed the air hostess uniforms for [[Olympic Airlines|Olympic Airways]], the designer who followed her was [[Pierre Cardin]]. In that time, Olympic Airways was a luxury airline, owned by the transport magnate [[Aristotle Onassis]]. After her death, the leadership of the company was handed down to Yvonne Dudel, Jean Cazaubon and Philippe Guibourgé.&lt;ref name="directory"/&gt;

After a period of time, Jacques Wertheimer bought the controlling interest of the House of Chanel.&lt;ref name="directory"/&gt;&lt;ref name="funding"/&gt; Critics stated that during his leadership, he never paid much attention to the company, as he was more interested in horse breeding.&lt;ref name="funding"/&gt; In 1974, the House of Chanel launched [[Cristalle]] eau de toilette, which was designed when Coco Chanel was alive. 1978 saw the launch of the first non-couture, [[prêt-à-porter]] line and worldwide distribution of accessories.

[[Alain Wertheimer]], son of Jacques Wertheimer, assumed control of Chanel S.A. in 1974.&lt;ref name="directory"/&gt;&lt;ref name="funding"/&gt; In the U.S., No. 5 de Chanel was not selling well.&lt;ref name="funding"/&gt; Alain revamped Chanel No.5 sales by reducing the number of outlets carrying the fragrance from 18,000 to 12,000. He removed the perfume from drugstore shelves and invested millions of dollars in advertisement for Chanel cosmetics. This ensured a greater sense of scarcity and exclusivity for No.5, and sales rocketed back up as demand for the fragrance increased.&lt;ref name="funding"/&gt; He used famous people to endorse the perfume — from [[Marilyn Monroe]] to [[Audrey Tautou]]. Looking for a designer who could bring the label to new heights, he persuaded [[Karl Lagerfeld]] to end his contract with fashion house [[Chloé]].

===The post-Coco era===

[[File:Chanel Haute Couture Fall-Winter 2011.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Chanel couture by Lagerfeld: the Autumn–Winter 2011–2012 collection]]
[[File:CHANELYorkdale.jpg|thumb|A Chanel store in North America]]
In 1981, Chanel launched Antaeus, an eau de toilette for men. In 1983 Karl Lagerfeld took over as chief designer for Chanel. Like Chanel, he looked into the past as inspiration for his designs. He incorporated the Chanel fabrics and detailing such as tweed, gold accents, and chains.  Lagerfeld kept what was signature for Chanel but also helped bring the brand into today.

In later collections Lagerfeld chose to break away from the ladylike look of Chanel and began to experiment with fabrics and styles. During the 1980s, more than 40 Chanel boutiques opened worldwide. By the end of the 1980s, the boutiques sold goods ranging from US$200-per-ounce perfume, US$225 ballerina slippers to US$11,000 dresses and US$2,000 leather handbags. Chanel cosmetics and fragrances were distributed only by Chanel outlets. Chanel marketer Jean Hoehn explained the firm's approach, saying, "We introduce a new fragrance every 10 years, not every three minutes like many competitors. We don't confuse the consumer. With Chanel, people know what to expect. And they keep coming back to us, at all ages, as they enter and leave the market." The 1984 launch of a new fragrance, in honor of the founder, ''[[Coco (perfume)|Coco]]'', continued the label's success. In 1986, the House of Chanel struck a deal with watchmakers and in 1987, the first Chanel watch debuted. By the end of the decade, Alain moved the offices to New York City.&lt;ref name="funding"/&gt;

Maison de Chanel increased the Wertheimer family fortune to $5&amp;nbsp;billion USD. Sales were hurt by the recession of the early 1990s, but Chanel recovered by the mid-1990s with further boutique expansion.&lt;ref name="funding"/&gt;

In 1994, Chanel had a net profit equivalent to €67 million on the sale of €570 million in ready-to-wear clothes and was the most profitable French fashion house.&lt;ref name="LBM 2012 58"&gt;{{cite book|last=Chevalier|first=Michel|title=Luxury Brand Management|year=2012|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|location=Singapore|isbn=978-1-118-17176-9|page=58 (of 316) |edition=second|author2=Gerald Mazzalovo |chapter=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, Chanel bought gun-makers [[Holland &amp; Holland]], but failed in its attempt to revamp the firm.&lt;ref name="funding"/&gt; It launched the perfumes Allure in 1996 and [[Allure Homme]] in 1998. The swimwear label [[Eres (fashion label)|Eres]] was purchased.{{when|date=July 2013}}{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} The House of Chanel launched its first skin care line, Précision, in 1999. That same year, Chanel launched a travel collection, and under a license contract with [[Luxottica]], introduced a line of [[sunglasses]] and eyeglass frames.

While Wertheimer remained chairman, Françoise Montenay became CEO and President. 2000 saw the launch of the first unisex watch by Chanel, the J12. In 2001, watchmaker Bell &amp; Ross was acquired. The same year, Chanel boutiques offering only selections of accessories were opened in the United States. Chanel launched a small selection of menswear as a part of their runway shows.

In 2002, Chanel launched the [[Chance (perfume)|Chance]] perfume and [[Paraffection]], a subsidiary company originally established in 1997&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chanel|url=http://www.vogue.com/voguepedia/Chanel#cite_note-20|publisher=Voguepedia|accessdate=28 September 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131030104112/http://www.vogue.com/voguepedia/Chanel#cite_note-20|archivedate=30 October 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; to support artisanal manufacturing, that gathered together [[Ateliers d'Art]] or workshops including Desrues for ornamentation and buttons, Lemarié for feathers, [[Maison Lesage|Lesage]] for embroidery, Massaro for shoemaking and Michel for millinery. A prêt-à-porter collection was designed by Karl Lagerfeld.

In July 2002, a jewelry and watch outlet opened on [[Madison Avenue]]. Within months, a {{convert|1,000|sqft|m2|-1|adj=on}} shoe/handbag boutique opened next door. Chanel continued to expand in the United States and by December 2002, operated 25 U.S. boutiques.&lt;ref name="funding"/&gt;

Chanel introduced [[Coco Mademoiselle]] and an "In-Between Wear" in 2003, targeting younger women, opened a second shop on Rue Cambon, opened a {{convert|2400|sqft|m2|-1}} boutique in Hong Kong and paid nearly $50&amp;nbsp;million USD for a building in [[Ginza]], Tokyo.

In 2018, Chanel announced that it would be moving its global headquarters to London. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-45517279|title=Chanel chooses London for global office|date=2018-09-13|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-10-28|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Corporate identity==

===Logotype===
The Chanel logotype comprises two interlocked, opposed letters-C, one faced left, one faced right. The logotype was given to Chanel by the Château de Crémat, Nice, and was not registered as a trademark until the first Chanel shops were established.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dinesh.com/history_of_logos/worlds_best_brands_and_logos/chanel_logo_design_and_history.html |accessdate=10 June 2010 |title=Chanel Logo Design and History |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100524025102/http://www.dinesh.com/history_of_logos/worlds_best_brands_and_logos/chanel_logo_design_and_history.html# |archivedate=24 May 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lachanelphile.com/2012/06/29/flash-back-friday-the-legend-of-the-chanel-double-c/ |title=Flash Back Friday: The Legend of the Chanel Logo's Double C |accessdate=14 January 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121209220900/http://www.lachanelphile.com/2012/06/29/flash-back-friday-the-legend-of-the-chanel-double-c/ |archivedate=9 December 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with other makers, Chanel is a target of counterfeiters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chanelreplica.com/ |title=A message from Chanel |publisher=Chanel Inc |accessdate=8 May 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120185606/http://www.chanelreplica.com/ |archivedate=20 November 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; China is prime supplier.

===Trademarks===
One timeline measurement for Chanel presence in the United States is via trademarks registered with the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] (USPTO). On Tuesday, 18 November 1924, Chanel, Inc. filed trademark applications for the typeset mark ''Chanel'' and for the  interlocking ''CC'' design plus word mark. At that time, the trademarks were registered only for the perfume, toiletry, and cosmetic products in the primary class of common metals and their alloys. Chanel provided the description of ''[[face powder]], perfume, [[Eau de Cologne|eau de cologne]], toilet water, [[Lipstick|lip stick]], and [[Rouge (cosmetics)|rouge]],'' to the USPTO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://tess2.uspto.gov/bin/showfield?f=doc&amp;state=4010:q5ck78.2.137 | title = U.S. Trademark 71205468 | publisher = Trademark Applications and Registrations Retrieval (TARR) | accessdate = 29 October 2011 | date = 18 November 1924 | agency = United States Patent and Trademark Office | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130810024658/http://tess2.uspto.gov/bin/showfield?f=doc&amp;state=4010:q5ck78.2.137 | archivedate = 10 August 2013 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Chanel and double-C trademarks were awarded on the same date of 24 February 1925 with respective Serial Numbers of 71205468 and 71205469. The first trademark application for the '''No. 5''' perfume was on Thursday, 1 April 1926,  described as perfume and toilet water. First use and commercial use was stated as 1 January 1921. Registration was granted on 20 July 1926 with Serial Number 71229497.

'''[[Film|Cinema]] in Estonia''' is the [[film industry]] of the [[Republic of Estonia]]. The motion pictures have won international awards and each year new Estonian films are seen at film festivals around the globe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://estonia.eu/about-estonia/culture-a-science/estonian-film.html Estonian Film 100] Estonia.eu&lt;/ref&gt;

==1896—1911==
The first "moving pictures" were screened in [[Tallinn]] in 1896.&lt;ref name="EE"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=eiIpe99dL5MC&amp;pg Eastern Europe By Tom Masters; p. 328]&lt;/ref&gt; The first movie theater was opened in 1908.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=mY1pAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=baltic+german+Cinema&amp;dq=baltic+german+Cinema&amp;ei=262zSMyPF5XIigH32_kj&amp;pgis=1 The Baltic States By Marje Jõeste, Küllo Arjakas] {{ISBN|978-5-89960-026-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; First local documentary was made in 1908 with the production of a [[newsreel]] about [[Sweden|Swedish]] King [[Gustav V of Sweden|Gustav V]]’s visit to [[Tallinn]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.einst.ee/publications/kultuur/cinema.html estonian culture - cinema&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==1912—1918==
The first Estonian documentary was created by [[Johannes Pääsuke]] in 1912 that was followed by a short film ''Karujaht Pärnumaal'' (Bear Hunt in Pärnumaa) in 1914. The first [[movie studio]] in Estonia, ''Estonia Film Tartus'' (The Tartu Studio of Estonia Film), was established by Johannes Pääsuke (1892–1918). Pääsuke produced documentaries, short films and pictures of Estonian nature for the [[Estonian National Museum]]. ''[[Karujaht Pärnumaal]]'' (Bear-Hunt in Pärnu County, 1914) was the first fictional short film made in Estonia. In total, eight films made by J. Pääsuke have survived and are stored at the [[Estonian Film Archives]].&lt;ref name="EFA"&gt;[http://filmi.arhiiv.ee The Estonian Film Archives]&lt;/ref&gt;

==1918—1940==
[[File:Konstatin Marska.jpg|thumb|[[Konstantin Märska]] at the [[Estonian Culture Film]] in 1936]]
The first full-length feature film was made in 1924 ''Shadow of the Past'' directed by [[Konstantin Märska]] and produced by his ''Konstantin Märska Filmiproduktsioon'' (Konstantin Märska Film Production). Two feature films by Märska have survived: ''Vigased pruudid'' (1929) and ''Jüri Rumm'' (1929). ''Theodor Lutsu Filmiproduktsioon'' (the Film Production of Theodor Luts Studio) was established by [[Theodor Luts]] and his wife [[Aksella Luts]], who produced documentaries and feature films. His ''[[Noored kotkad]]'' (Young Eagles) (1927) is generally regarded as the cornerstone of Estonian cinema. &lt;ref name="Connor"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=IpR0-OrrwssC&amp;pg Culture And Customs of the Baltic States By Kevin O'Connor]&lt;/ref&gt; Luts was also responsible for directing the only Estonian sound feature made before Soviet era, an Estonian-Finnish co-production ''Päikese lapsed'' (1932). Luts moved to Finland to work as a cinematographer immediately after finishing the film, and never returned to Estonia. Smaller film production studios in Estonia included ''Siirius Film'' and ''K.Kalamees Tartu''.

The major film production company after the [[Great Depression]] hit Estonia during the 1930s was state subsidized the [[Estonian Culture Film]] ({{lang-et|Eesti Kultuurfilm}}) that produced mostly documentaries.&lt;br/&gt;
In late 1930s, Academy Award nominated [[Miliza Korjus]] best known for a role in [[The Great Waltz (film)|''The Great Waltz'' (1938)]], daughter of an [[Estonia]]n [[lieutenant colonel]] in the Imperial Russian Army and later Chief of Staff to the War Minister of Estonia, had a successful career in Hollywood film industry&lt;ref name="CaCoBS"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=lVBB1a0rC70C&amp;pg Eastern Europe By Richard C. Frucht; p.95]&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Estonian animated short film ''[[Kutsu-Juku seiklusi]]'' was made in 1931.&lt;ref name="KJS"&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0212290/]&lt;/ref&gt;

==1940—1953==
During the first year of [[occupation of the Baltic states|Soviet occupation]] (1940–1941) ''Eesti Kultuurfilm'' was taken over by the Communist Party and renamed ''Kinokroonika Eesti Stuudio'' (the Estonian Newsreel Studio). During the first decades of Soviet rule as Estonia became a part of USSR in 1944 after the end of World War II, filmmakers in Estonia were mostly coming from inner Soviet Union whose job was to create propaganda films that depicted the victory of socialism in a form of newsreels and documentaries.&lt;ref name="CaCoBS"/&gt;

Former Eesti Kultuurfilm was called ''Kinokroonika Tallinna Stuudio'' (The Tallinn Newsreel Studio) in 1942 during the [[Occupation of Estonia by Nazi Germany|German occupation]] in World War II and ''Tallinna Kinostuudio'' (The Tallinn Film Studio) in 1947 again by the Soviets.&lt;ref name="EFA"/&gt;

During the era two feature films on Soviet themes were produced in Estonia directed by [[Gerbert Rappaport]], an [[Austrians|Austrian]] émigré in Soviet Union:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kontakt.erstebankgroup.net/events/2008-04_Filmmuseum+Wien_Rappaport/en Rappaport @ Filmmuseum in Wien]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Elu tsitadellis (Life in the Citadel)'' in 1947, ''Valgus Koordis (Light in Koordi)'' in 1951 that was the first [[color motion picture film]] made in Estonia.&lt;ref name="EFA"/&gt;

==1953—1991==
After the death of Stalin in 1953 a more liberal period in Soviet Union's cultural policies followed. Filmmakers started to enjoy greater artistic control at the same time the Soviet State Committee for Cinematography ([[Goskino]]) in Moscow provided the money, state censorship body [[Glavlit]] and [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|CPSU]] Department of Culture had the control over releasing the movies.&lt;ref name="Connor"/&gt;

The Tallinn Film Studio was renamed ''Kunstiliste ja Kroonikafilmide Tallinna Kinostuudio'' (Tallinn Feature- and Newsreel Film Studio) in 1954 and in 1963 was renamed again [[Tallinnfilm]] &lt;ref name="EFA"/&gt;

Some of the first films produced during the era that were co directed by an Estonian [[Kaljo Kiisk]] were ''Juunikuu päevad'' (1957) and ''Vallatud kurvid'' also known as ''[[Opasniye Povoroty]]'', the first dramatic film shot in [[Kinopanorama]] (1959).

In the 1960s a story of [[Furst Gabriel or Last Days of the Pirita Monastery|Prince Gabriel]] by Estonian writer [[Eduard Bornhöhe]] was turned into a movie script by [[Arvo Valton]]. [[Grigori Kromanov]] was named to be the director of ''[[Viimne reliikvia]]'' (The Last Relic), released in 1969 by Tallinnfilm. The movie set the absolute box office record for the entire Soviet Union at the time by selling 44,9 million tickets.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=loCDXm_Ar58C&amp;pg=PA325&amp;dq=Last+Relic+absolute+box+office&amp;sig=ACfU3U1PuHZmoYs8zDYWR1Yn5J2MuyIdTw Bridging the Cultural Divide By Sigrid Rieuwerts; p. 325]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0065180/business Box office for Viimne reliikvia @ IMDB]&lt;/ref&gt; It was successfully distributed by the Soviet film export internationally in more than 60 countries. The film also influenced Estonian literature: 2 short stories listed for the [[Friedebert Tuglas]] award in 1970-75 included references to the Last Relic.

Another milestone in Estonian Cinema released in 1969 was [[Arvo Kruusement]]'s ''[[Spring (1969 film)|''Kevade'']]'' (Spring) based on [[Oskar Luts]] popular novel.&lt;ref name="EE"/&gt;

Successful films in the 1980s were ''[["Hukkunud Alpinisti" hotell]]'' (Dead Mountaineer's Hotel) by Kromanov and movies made by [[Kaljo Kiisk]] such as ''Nipernaadi'' (1983).

The most prominent female director [[Leida Laius]] who emerged during the era is best known for her ''Kõrboja peremees'' (1979) and ''Naerata ometi'' (1985) receiving at the [[Berlin International Film Festival]] UNICEF Award in 1985. [[Peeter Simm]]'s best known Soviet era film is ''Ideaalmaastik'' (The Ideal Landscape) released in 1980. [[Peeter Urbla]]'s ''Ma pole turist, ma elan siin'' (I'm Not a Tourist, I'm Living Here) (1988).  [[Jaan Kolgerg]] emerged by the end of Soviet era with films ''See kadunud tee'' (1990) (The Lost Way) and ''Võlausaldajad'' (Creditors) (1992)

Among the leading Estonian film actors during the Soviet era were [[Rein Aren]] with about 30 roles, [[Jüri Järvet]] and [[Leonhard Merzin]].&lt;ref name="Connor"/&gt;

==Since 1991==
After the collapse of the Soviet Union Estonia regained its independence, the cost of filmmaking skyrocketed and the 1990s showed decline in filmmaking that reached its bottom in 1996, the year when no [[fictional films]] and only 2 documentaries ''Lipule... güüsile... valvel!'' and ''Turvalisuse illusioon'' were made in Estonia.

In 1997, the [[Estonian Film Foundation]] was founded by the Estonian Ministry of Culture. Production of  ''Minu Leninid'' (All My Lenins) (1997) a parody of Soviet Revolution by [[Hardi Volmer]] marked a turnaround for Estonian feature films. In 1998, there were two feature films produced.  ''[[Georgica (film)|Georgica]]'' directed by Sulev Keedus won the ''FIPRESCI Prize'' at the [[Stockholm Film Festival]] in 1998 and the ''Prix Europa Special'' at [[Prix Europa]] in 1999.

Since then, the trend has also been towards joint film productions such as Peeter Simm's ''Head käed'' (Good Hands) (2001) a joint Estonian-Latvian coproduction that in 2002 won the ''Manfred Salzgeber Award'' at the [[Berlin International Film Festival]] and the ''Golden Olive Tree''
[[Lecce Festival of European Cinema]] in Italy. ''Kõrini'' (Fed Up) (2005) an Estonian-German coproduction. [[Arvo Iho]]' s  ''Karu süda'' (Hart of the Bear) (2001) nominated for ''Golden St. George'' at the Moscow International Film Festival and for the ''European Film Award'' at [[European Film Awards]], was a coproduction between Estonia, Germany, Russia and the Czech Republic.

The most commercially successful Estonian film in 2002 was ''[[Names in Marble (film)|Nimed marmortahvlil]]''  (2002) (Names in Marble) by [[Elmo Nüganen]] and in 2003 a comedy by [[Rando Pettai]] ''Vanad ja kobedad saavad jalad alla'' (Made in Estonia) that in Estonia topped the international blockbuster ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers]]'' with its box office results.&lt;ref name="Connor"/&gt;

In 2004, two young directors emerged Jaak Kilmi and [[René Reinumägi]] with their ''[[Revolution of Pigs|Sigade revolutsioon]]''
(Revolution of Pigs) that won the ''Special Jury Prize'' and was nominated for ''Golden St. George'' at the [[Moscow International Film Festival]], and for ''Grand Prix Asturias'' at the [[Gijón International Film Festival]].

In 2007, about 10 feature films were made in Estonia. Most notable perhaps ''Sügisball'' (2007) by Veiko Õunpuu receiving among other awards ''Best Director'' at the [[Thessaloniki Film Festival]], [[International Film Festival Bratislava]] and ''Venice Horizons Award'' at the [[64th Venice International Film Festival]]. ''Georg'' (2007) by Peeter Simm is a movie about the life of legendary Estonian singer [[Georg Ots]].

Most recent awarded film is Veiko Õunpuu's ''[[The Temptation of St. Tony]]'' (2009). In 2011, Estonia made eight full-length films, which included one animated film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=International Film Guide 2012 |first=Ian Hayden |last=Smith |year= 2012 |isbn= 978-1-908215-01-7 |page= 111 }}&lt;!--|accessdate= 5 April 2012--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Coldren Opera House''' is a former theater that operated in [[Iowa City]], Iowa from 1877 until its closure in 1912.

==History==

The original opening of [[Englert Theatre]] with its legitimate stage and orchestra pit, plus a huge retractable screen for motion picture presentations, coupled with a new [[University of Iowa]] auditorium in Macbride Hall, which had been opened during 1908, spelled doom for another notable Iowa City institution, the Coldren Opera House (initially called the Grand Opera House) at 105 College Street.

Although calling itself an opera house, little opera was ever performed there.  Rather, the name avoided less respectable terms,&lt;ref&gt;Eggers, Lolly Parker, ''A Century of Stories, The History of the Iowa City Public Library, 1896-1997,'' 1997, Iowa City Public Library Friends Foundation, p.67&lt;/ref&gt; such as "theater" or "drama house." From its opening during 1877 until its 1912 closing, the Coldren had served hundreds of the prominent traveling road shows and events of its era, including a [http://oscarwildeinamerica.org/lectures-1882/april/0427-iowa-city.html lecture by Oscar Wilde in 1882], as well as a variety of university functions from presidential inaugurations to graduation ceremonies.

The Coldren interior, considered spectacular in its time,&lt;ref&gt;Eggers, p.67-68&lt;/ref&gt; had featured an array of chandelier and sconce lighting fixtures using coal gas produced locally beginning during 1857.&lt;ref&gt;Hibbs, Bob, Iowa City Press-Citizen, ''Saturday Postcard: Coal gas in antique Iowa City,'' March 6, 2004, p.2B ([http://iagenweb.org/johnson/PostcardHibbs/Postcard53.htm online version])&lt;/ref&gt; Its stage lighting was state-of-the-art during the late 19th century.  After the Coldren purchase and remodeling of 1897, it seated 845 on three levels within two floors of the structure.

'''''Young man playing the lute''''' is an oil painting in the collection of the [[Rijksmuseum]] that is a period copy of the [[The_Lute_Player_(Hals)|same subject]] by [[Frans Hals]].&lt;ref name=Hofrichter&gt;Judith Leyster: A Woman Painter in Holland's Golden Age, by Frima Fox Hofrichter, Doornspijk, 1989, Davaco Publishers, {{ISBN|90-70288-62-1}}, catalog #1&lt;/ref&gt; It was acquired by the museum as a painting by [[Frans Hals]] and was skipped by the researcher Juliane Harms in 1927, being finally attributed to Leyster by [[Seymour Slive]] in 1974.

==Provenance==
The painting was sold in Amsterdam in 1822, but was in Dordrecht by 1850 where it was later bequeathed to the museum in 1870 by L. Dupper Wz.&lt;ref name=Hofrichter/&gt;  in 1883 it was documented by [[Wilhelm von Bode]] as by Hals and in 1910 [[Hofstede de Groot]] called it a copy of the version in the collection of the Baron Gustave de Rothschild, Paris (now in the Louvre).&lt;ref name=Hofrichter/&gt;&lt;ref&gt; [https://archive.org/stream/catalogueraisonn03hofsuoft#page/69/mode/1up Hofstede de Groot] on "A Fool with a Mandoline"; catalog number 98&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to Hofrichter, the copy is better documented than the original, because a drawing by [[David Bailly]] is dated 1624 and is clearly drawn from the copy.&lt;ref name=Hofrichter/&gt; A painted copy also exists that is either based on the copy or the drawing, based on the part in the hair. The date of 1624 makes the painting one of the earliest works by Leyster and clearly the upward glance became her trademark in later works.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5645">{{European patent law}}
In [[European Union law]], and especially in European [[intellectual property]] law, a '''cross-border injunction''' is an [[injunction]] by a [[court]] in one European country, such as for example a court in the [[Netherlands]] forbidding [[intellectual property infringement|infringement]] in several other European countries.

==Background==
The [[Brussels Regime]] instruments are a set of similar legal instruments, based on which jurisdiction (and recognition) is determined. The instruments are the Brussels I Regulations (44/2001 and 1215/2012), Lugano Conventions (1998, 2007) and the Brussels Convention (1968). The conventions together cover the European Union, Iceland, Norway, Switzerland, Aruba and all French territories. 

A legal basis for cross-border injunctions may amongst others be found in Article 6(1) (most instruments) or Article 8(1) (EU regulation 1215/2012), providing that "a person domiciled in a Member State to also be sued
* where he is one of a number of defendants, in the courts for the place where any one of them is domiciled,
* provided the claims are so closely connected that it is expedient to hear and determine them together to avoid the risk of irreconcilable judgments resulting from separate proceedings".

==Case law==
For a period in the late-1990s, national courts issued cross-border injunctions covering all Brussels regime jurisdictions, but this has been limited by the [[European Court of Justice]] (ECJ).  

In two cases in July 2006, interpreting Articles 6(1) and 16(4) of the Brussels Convention, the ECJ held that [[European patent]]s are national rights that must be enforced nationally, that it was "unavoidable" that infringements of the same European patent have to be litigated in each relevant national court, even if the lawsuit is against the same group of companies, and that cross-border injunctions are not available.&lt;ref&gt;[http://curia.europa.eu/jurisp/cgi-bin/form.pl?lang=EN&amp;Submit=Rechercher$docrequire=alldocs&amp;numaff=C-4/03&amp;datefs=&amp;datefe=&amp;nomusuel=&amp;domaine=&amp;mots=&amp;resmax=100 Case C-4/03, ''Gesellschaft für Antriebstechnik  v Lamellen und Kupplungsbau Beteiligungs KG'', (European Ct. of Justice 13 July 2006)]; [http://curia.europa.eu/jurisp/cgi-bin/form.pl?lang=EN&amp;Submit=Rechercher$docrequire=alldocs&amp;numaff=C-539/03&amp;datefs=&amp;datefe=&amp;nomusuel=&amp;domaine=&amp;mots=&amp;resmax=100 Case C-539/03, ''Roche Nederland BV v Primus'', (European Ct. of Justice 13 July 2006)]&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, the court set forth in grounds 41 of case C-539/03 that "Article 6(1) of the Brussels Convention ... does not apply in European patent infringement proceedings involving a number of companies established in various Contracting States in respect of acts committed in one or more of those States even where those companies, which belong to the same group, may have acted in an identical or similar manner in accordance with a common policy elaborated by one of them". In other words, there will be no close connection between claims as required by Article 6(1) if two closely connected companies domiciled in different Contracting States act (infringe) in the same manner.

Also in 2006, the ECJ decided on case C-04/03 (GAT/LUK). The court ruled that "Article 16(4) of the Convention … is to be interpreted as meaning that the rule of exclusive jurisdiction laid down therein concerns all proceedings relating to the registration or validity of a patent, irrespective of whether the issue is raised by way of an action or a plea in objection". As of 2015, Article 16(4) of the Convention corresponds to Article 24(4) of EU regulation 1215/2012. The ruling in case C-04/03 confirms that the courts of each Contracting State have exclusive jurisdiction on validity of patents registered for the territory of that State. Exclusive jurisdiction under Article 22(4) applies irrespective of whether a patent proprietor is sued for revocation or whether an alleged infringer asserts invalidity in inter partes proceedings.

In 2012, nearly six years after its rulings on cases C-04/03 and C-539/03, the ECJ decided on case C-616/10 (Solvay/Honeywell).&lt;ref&gt;[http://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf?docid=124996&amp;doclang=EN ''Solvay SA v Honeywell Fluorine Products Europe BV, Honeywell Belgium NV, Honeywell Europe NV'', (European Ct. of Justice 12 July 2012)]&lt;/ref&gt; The court held that "Article 22(4) of Regulation No 44/2001 must be interpreted as not precluding, in circumstances such as those at issue in the main proceedings, the application of Article 31 of that regulation". Since Article 31 is about provisional measures, a court may issue a cross-border injunction where an action aims for such measures. The ruling on case C-539/03 allows for a court to issue cross-border injunctions as provisional measures where companies domiciled in different Contracting States infringe in the same Contracting State.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13369">'''Design optimization''' is an engineering design '''methodology''' using a mathematical formulation of a design problem to support selection of the optimal design among many alternatives. Design optimization involves the following stages:&lt;ref name="pyp2017"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://principlesofoptimaldesign.org/|title=Principles of Optimal Design: Modeling and Computation|last=Papalambros|first=Panos Y.|last2=Wilde|first2=Douglass J.|date=2017-01-31|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=|isbn=9781316867457|location=|pages=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Constraints: Combination of Variables expressed as equalities or inequalities that must be satisfied for any acceptable design alternative
# Feasibility: Values for set of variables that satisfies all constraints and minimizes/maximizes Objective.

== Design optimization problem ==
{{Main|Optimization problem}}
The formal mathematical ([[Canonical form|standard form]]) statement of the design optimization problem is &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/cvxbook/bv_cvxbook.pdf|title=Convex Optimization|last=Boyd|first=Stephen|last2=Boyd|first2=Stephen P.|last3=California)|first3=Stephen (Stanford University Boyd|last4=Vandenberghe|first4=Lieven|last5=Angeles)|first5=Lieven (University of California Vandenberghe, Los|date=2004-03-08|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=|isbn=9780521833783|location=|pages=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
&amp;{\operatorname{minimize}}&amp; &amp; f(x) \\
&amp;\operatorname{subject\;to}
&amp; &amp;h_i(x) = 0, \quad i = 1, \dots,m_1 \\ 
&amp;&amp;&amp;g_j(x) \leq 0, \quad j = 1,\dots,m_2 \\
&amp;\operatorname{and}
&amp; &amp;x \in X \subseteq R^n
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where

* &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is a vector of ''n'' real-valued design variables &lt;math&gt;x_1, x_2, ..., x_n&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; is the '''objective function''' 
* &lt;math&gt;h_i(x)&lt;/math&gt; are &lt;math&gt;m_1&lt;/math&gt;'''equality constraints''' 
* &lt;math&gt;g_j(x)&lt;/math&gt; are &lt;math&gt;m_2&lt;/math&gt; '''inequality constraints''' 
* &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a set constraint that includes additional restrictions on &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; besides those implied by the equality and inequality constraints.

The problem formulation stated above is a convention called the ''negative null form'', since all constraint function are expressed as equalities and negative inequalities with zero on the right-hand side. This convention is used so that numerical algorithms developed to solve design optimization problems can assume a standard expression of the mathematical problem.

We can introduce the vector-valued functions

&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
&amp;&amp;&amp;{h = (h_1,h_2,\dots,h_{m1})}\\
\operatorname{and}\\
&amp;&amp;&amp;{g = (g_1, g_2,\dots, g_{m2})}
\end{align}

&lt;/math&gt; '' ''

to rewrite the above statement in the compact expression

&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
&amp;{\operatorname{minimize}}&amp; &amp; f(x) \\
&amp;\operatorname{subject\;to}
&amp; &amp;h(x) = 0,\quad g(x) \leq 0,\quad x \in X \subseteq R^n\\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

We call &lt;math&gt;h, g&lt;/math&gt; the ''set'' or ''system of'' (''functional'') ''constraints'' and &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; the ''set constraint''.

== Application ==
Design optimization applies the methods of [[mathematical optimization]] to design problem formulations and it is sometimes used interchangeably with the term [[engineering optimization]].  When the objective function ''f'' is a [[Vector-valued function|vector]] rather than a [[Scalar field|scalar]], the problem becomes a [[multi-objective optimization]] one. If the design optimization problem has more than one mathematical solutions the methods of [[global optimization]] are used to identified the global optimum.

'''''Father's Little Dividend''''' is a 1951 American [[comedy film]] directed by [[Vincente Minnelli]] and starring [[Spencer Tracy]], [[Joan Bennett]], and [[Elizabeth Taylor]]. The movie is the sequel to ''[[Father of the Bride (1950 film)|Father of the Bride]]'' (1950).

==Plot==
In this sequel to ''[[Father of the Bride (1950 film)|Father of the Bride]]'', newly married Kay Dunstan ([[Elizabeth Taylor]]) announces that she and her husband are going to have a baby, leaving her father, Stanley Banks ([[Spencer Tracy]]), having to come to grips with becoming a grandfather.

Middle-class family man Stanley Banks reminisces on events of the past year: One afternoon, returning from the office feeling happy and energetic, Stanley's routine is interrupted when his wife Ellie ([[Joan Bennett]]) tells him that they are having dinner with their daughter Kay and her husband, Buckley Dunstan ([[Don Taylor (actor)|Don Taylor]]), to hear some important news. Although Stanley is certain that it concerns Buckley's business, the newlyweds reveal that Kay is expecting a baby. Buckley's parents, Doris ([[Billie Burke]]) and Herbert ([[Moroni Olsen]]), are delighted, as is Ellie, but Stanley broods that he is too young and vibrant to be a grandfather. Soon Ellie, flush with excitement, throws Kay a baby shower, something Stanley thinks is highway robbery not punishable by law. Later, Ellie suggests that they remodel their house to enable Kay, Buckley, and the baby to move in with them, but Stanley puts his foot down. Ellie is near tears when the wealthy Dunstans announce that they are planning to add a wing to their home for the couple, but is overjoyed when Kay and Buckley reveal that they have just bought their own little house, enabling Ellie to have free rein helping Kay decorate.

After settling into their new home, Kay, who is very close to her father, expresses her concern that the baby will make a difference in her relationship with Buckley. Stanley comforts her by telling her how much he loved her as a baby. Soon the Bankses and the Dunstans are trying to outdo one another buying gifts and making plans for the baby, up to his enrollment in college. One night, while listening to Ellie, Doris, and Herbert bicker over what the baby should be named, Kay breaks down and runs to her room. Only Stanley, whom Kay feels is the sole parent who understands her is able to comfort her. The day after pledging to Kay that he will make certain that none of the in-laws will interfere again, Stanley drags Ellie to Kay's physician, Dr. Andrew Nordell, anxious over the "modern" ideas Nordell has about a more natural method of childbirth and infant care.

For the next month or so, things remain calm, until Stanley is awakened by a late night call from Buckley, who says that Kay has left him "for good." After sneaking over to Buckley and Kay's place, Stanley learns from a cab driver that Kay took a taxi to his house. The two men then return to the Banks house, where the couple make up after Kay's jealousy is revealed to be a misunderstanding stemming from Buckley's late nights working at the office. Kay, as well as Stanley, realize Buckley's devotion to his family.

As the baby's birth approaches, nerves among the parents and grandparents become frayed. The eventual birth of a baby boy delights everyone, except Stanley, a distant and wary observer of the as-yet-unnamed baby, who starts to cry whenever Stanley comes near him.

When the baby is six months old, Kay joins Buckley on a brief business trip and leaves the baby with her parents, hoping to give Stanley time to grow closer to his grandson. One afternoon, while Kay is still away, Stanley takes the baby for a walk in the park. When the baby finally falls asleep in his carriage, Stanley joins some friendly neighborhood boys in a game of football and loses track of time. After the game, when Stanley cannot find the carriage, he frantically retraces his steps back to the house. Seeing through the window that Kay has returned early, he panics and takes a taxi to the local police station. There a befuddled Stanley confesses to the grim-faced police sergeant that he has lost the baby. Fearing the wrath of the police squad, who found the sweet-natured baby and have fallen in love with him, Stanley secretly prays that his grandson will not start to scream when he picks him up. To Stanley's relief, the baby is delighted to see him, and from that moment on, the two are devoted to each other. Some time later, at the baby's christening, Stanley beams with pride as his grandson is finally named "Stanley Banks Dunstan."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Father's Little Dividend, Brief Synopsis|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/3230/Father-s-Little-Dividend/|website=www.tcm.com|publisher=TCM|accessdate=2014-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
[[Image:Joan Bennett in Father's Little Dividend trailer.JPG|thumb|from the trailer for the film]]
''Father's Little Dividend'' was semi-remade in 1995 as ''[[Father of the Bride Part II]]'', with [[Steve Martin]] and [[Diane Keaton]] in Tracy and Bennett's roles. However, Keaton's character also has a baby and the plot has many similarities to this movie.

Spencer Tracy and Joan Bennett had made films together two decades earlier, including ''[[Me and My Gal]]'' (1932), in which their characters marry, and ''[[She Wanted a Millionaire]]'' (1932).

According to film critic [[Leonard Maltin]], this film was one of the first examples of a proper movie studio sequel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://maltinonmovies.wolfpop.com/audio/20402/sequels|title=Sequels - Maltin On Movies|work=StageBloc}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
According to MGM records the film earned $3,122,000 in the U.S. and Canada and $1.5 million elsewhere, resulting in a profit of $2,025,000.&lt;ref name="Mannix"/&gt;

==Copyright status==
Originally released by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]], the film entered the [[List of films in the public domain in the United States|public domain in the United States]] in 1979 because MGM did not renew the copyright registration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=David |last=Pierce |date=June 2007 |title=Forgotten Faces: Why Some of Our Cinema Heritage Is Part of the Public Domain  |journal=Film History: An International Journal |volume=19 |issue=2 |pages=125–43 |issn=0892-2160 |oclc=15122313 |jstor=25165419 |doi=10.2979/FIL.2007.19.2.125 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the fact that [[Warner Bros.|Warner Bros. Entertainment]] (via ownership of [[Turner Entertainment]]) owns the distribution rights to the original, they have not yet released an authorized [[DVD]] release of the sequel, which is available on DVD through several other DVD distributors.

"'''Goodbye Blinky Bill'''" is a song written and recorded by [[John Williamson (singer)|John Williamson]] with [[Bullamakanka]] and Ami and George Williamson. The song was released in a limited edition in March 1986 as the only single from Williamson's 1986 compilation album ''[[All the Best (John Williamson album)|All the Best]]''. 

The song is a [[conservation]] song, raising awareness of the decline in numbers of the Australian [[koala]] due to deforestation of [[eucalypts]] trees; with reference to an [[anthropomorphic]] koala named [[Blinky Bill]]. [[Australian dollar|A$1]] from each sale was donated to the Koala Preservation Society in [[Port Macquarie]].&lt;ref name="Notes"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.koalaland.com.au/single-post/2011/11/18/John-Williamson-Goodbye-Blinky-Bill|title= John Williamson - Goodbye Blinky Bill|publisher=Koala Land|date=2011|accessdate=22 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://greatsong.net/PAROLES-JOHN-WILLIAMSON,GOODBYE-BLINKY-BILL,102861986.html|title=Paroles de GOODBYE BLINKY BILL John Williamson|publisher=Great Song|accessdate=23 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Graphic design''' is the process of visual communication and problem-solving through the use of [[typography]], [[photography]] and [[illustration]]. The field is considered a subset of [[visual communication]] and [[communication design]], but sometimes the term "graphic [[design]]" is used synonymously. Graphic designers create and combine symbols, images and text to form visual representations of ideas and messages. They use [[typography]], [[visual arts]] and [[page layout]] techniques to create [[Composition (visual arts)|visual compositions]]. Common uses of graphic design include [[corporate design]] (logos and branding), editorial design (magazines, newspapers and books), [[wayfinding|wayfinding or environmental design]], [[advertising]], [[web design]], [[communication design]], product [[Packaging and labeling|packaging]] and [[signage]].

==History==
{{Main article|History of graphic design}}
[[Image:KellsFol114vTuncDicit.gif|thumb|Page from the [[Book of Kells]]: Folio 114v, Decorated text. ''Tunc dicit illis'']]The term graphic design was coined by [[William Addison Dwiggins]] in 1922.&lt;ref&gt;Drucker, Johanna and McVarish, Emily, 'Graphic Design History: A critical Guide'. [[Pearson Education]], 2009&lt;/ref&gt; However, the origins of graphic design can be traced from the origins of human existence, from the caves of [[Lascaux]], to Rome's [[Trajan's Column]] to the [[illuminated manuscript]]s of the Middle Ages, to the neon lights of [[Ginza]], [[Tokyo]]. In "Babylon, artisans pressed cuneiform inscriptions into clay bricks or tablets which were used for construction. The bricks gave information such as the name of the reigning monarch, the builder, or some other dignitary".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Advertising In America|last = Ulanoff|first = Stanley M.|publisher = |year = |isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the first known road sign announcing the name of the governor of a state or mayor of the city. The Egyptians developed communication by hieroglyphics that used picture symbols dating as far back as 136 B.C. found on the [[Rosetta Stone]]. "The Rosetta stone, found by one of Napoleon's engineers was an advertisement for the Egyptian ruler, Ptolemy as the "true Son of the Sun, the Father of the Moon, and the Keeper of the Happiness of Men"" &lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; The Egyptians also invented [[papyrus]], paper made from reeds found along the Nile, on which they transcribed advertisements more common among their people at the time. During the "[[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]]", from 500 &lt;small&gt;AD&lt;/small&gt; to 1450 &lt;small&gt;AD&lt;/small&gt;, monks created elaborate, illustrated manuscripts.

In both its lengthy history and in the relatively recent explosion of [[visual communication]] in the 20th and 21st centuries, the distinction between [[advertising]], art, graphic design and [[fine art]] has disappeared. They share many elements, theories, principles, practices, [[language]]s and sometimes the same benefactor or client. In advertising, the ultimate objective is the sale of goods and services. In graphic design, "the essence is to give order to information, form to ideas, expression, and feeling to artifacts that document human experience."&lt;ref&gt;Meggs, Philip B., 'A history of graphic design'. New York: Van Nostrand Reinhold, 1983&lt;/ref&gt;

Graphic design in the United States began with [[Benjamin Franklin]] who used his newspaper ''[[Pennsylvania Gazette|The Pennsylvania Gazette]]'', to master the art of publicity to promote his own books and to influence the masses. "Benjamin Franklin's ingenuity gained in strength as did his cunning and in 1737 he had replaced his counterpart in Pennsylvania, [[Andrew Bradford]] as postmaster and printer after a competition he instituted and won. He showed his prowess by running an ad in his ''General Magazine and the Historical Chronicle of British Plantations in America'' (the precursor to the [[The Saturday Evening Post|Saturday Evening Post]]) that stressed the benefits offered by a stove he invented, named called the ''Pennsylvania Fireplace''. His invention is still sold today and is known as ''the [[Franklin stove]]''. "&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Advertising Age. How It Was In Advertising: 1776-1976. Chicago, Illinois: Crain Books, 1976.&lt;/ref&gt;

American advertising initially imitated British newspapers and magazines. Advertisements were printed in scrambled type and uneven lines that made it difficult to read. Franklin better organized this by adding 14-point type for the first line of the advertisement; although later shortened and centered it, making "headlines". Franklin added illustrations, something that London printers had not attempted. Franklin was the first to utilize [[logo]]s, which were early symbols that announced such services as opticians by displaying golden spectacles. Franklin taught advertisers that the use of detail was important in marketing their products. Some advertisements ran for 10-20 lines, including color, names, varieties, and sizes of the goods that were offered.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

===The advent of printing===
{{Main article|History of printing}}
During the [[Tang Dynasty]] (618–907) wood blocks were cut to print on textiles and later to reproduce Buddhist texts. A Buddhist scripture printed in 868 is the earliest known printed book. Beginning in the 11th century, longer scrolls and books were produced using [[movable type]] printing, making books widely available during the [[Song dynasty]] (960–1279).&lt;ref&gt;" Printing" The Silk Road Foundation. Retrieved May 31, 2008. [http://www.silk-road.com/artl/printing.shtml Silk-road.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509141910/http://www.silk-road.com/artl/printing.shtml |date=2008-05-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 17th-18th century movable type was used for handbills or trade cards which were printed from wood or copper engravings. These documents announced a business and its location. English painter [[William Hogarth]] used his skill in engraving was one of the first to design for business trade.

In Mainz Germany, in 1448, [[Johann Gutenberg]] &lt;nowiki/&gt;introduced movable type using a new metal alloy for use in a [[printing press]] and opened a new era of commerce. This made graphics more readily available since mass printing dropped the price of printing material significantly. Previously, most advertising was word of mouth. In France and England, for example, [[Town crier|criers]] announced products for sale just as [[Ancient Rome|ancient Romans]] had done.

The printing press made books more widely available. [[Aldus Manutius]] developed the book structure that became the foundation of western publication design. This era of graphic design is called [[Renaissance Humanism|Humanist]] or Old Style. Additionally, [[William Caxton]], England's first printer produced religious books, but had trouble selling them. He discovered the use of leftover pages and used them to announce the books and post them on church doors. This practice was termed ''"squis"'' or ''"pin up" posters,'' in approximately 1612, becoming the first form of print advertising in Europe''.'' The term ''Siquis'' came from the Roman era when public notices were posted stating ''"if anybody..."'', which is Latin for ''"si quis"''. These printed announcements were followed by later public registers of ''wants'' called ''want ads'' and in some areas such as the first periodical in Paris advertising was termed "advices". The "Advices" were what we know today as ''want ad media'' or ''advice columns''.

In 1638 [[Harvard University]] received a printing press from England. More than 52 years passed before London bookseller [[Benjamin Harris (publisher)|Benjamin Harris]] received another printing press in Boston. Harris published a newspaper in serial form, ''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'[[Publick Occurrences Both Forreign and Domestick|Publick Occurrences Both Foreign and Domestick'&lt;nowiki/&gt;]]''. It was four pages long and suppressed by the government after its first edition.

John Campbell is credited for the first newspaper, the ''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'[[The Boston News-Letter|Boston News-Letter]]'&lt;nowiki/&gt;'', which appeared in 1704. The paper was known during the revolution as ''"Weeklies"''. The name came from the 13 hours required for the ink to dry on each side of the paper. ''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'The solution was to first, print the ads and then to print the news on the other side the day before publication.

Campbell's first paid advertisement was in his third edition, May 7 or 8th,  1704. Two of the first ads were for stolen anvils. The third was for real estate in [[Oyster Bay (town), New York|Oyster Bay]], owned by [[William Bradford (Colonial printer)|William Bradford]], a pioneer printer in New York, and the first to sell something of value. Bradford published his first newspaper in 1725, New York's first, the [[New-York Gazette]]''. Bradford's son preceded him in Philadelphia publishing the ''[[Andrew Bradford|American Weekly Mercury]]'', 1719. ''The Mercury'' and William Brooker's ''Massachusetts Gazette'', first published a day earlier.

===Design industry===
In late 19th-century Europe, especially in the United Kingdom, the first official publication of a printed design was released, marking the separation of graphic design from fine art.

In 1849, [[Henry Cole]] became one of the major forces in [[design education]] in Great Britain, informing the government of the importance of design in his ''Journal of Design and Manufactures''. He organized the [[Great Exhibition]] as a celebration of modern industrial technology and Victorian design.

From 1891 to 1896, [[William Morris]]' Kelmscott Press published some of the most significant of the graphic design products of the [[Arts and Crafts movement]], and made a lucrative business of creating and selling stylish books. Morris created a market for works of graphic design in their own right and a profession for this new type of art. The Kelmscott Press is characterized by an obsession with historical styles. This historicism was the first significant reaction to the state of nineteenth-century graphic design. Morris' work, along with the rest of the [[Private Press]] movement, directly influenced [[Art Nouveau]].&lt;ref name=mccarthy&gt;Fiona McCarthy, ''William Morris'', London: Faber and Faber, 1996 {{ISBN|0-571-17495-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "graphic design" first appeared in print in the 1922 essay "New Kind of Printing Calls for New Design" by [[William Addison Dwiggins]], an American book designer in the early 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Drucker, Johanna and McVarish, Emily, 'Graphic Design History: A critical Guide'. Pearson Education, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Raffe's ''Graphic Design'', published in 1927, was the first book to use "Graphic Design" in its title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Baker|first=Steve |year=1990|title=The Sign of the Self in the Metropolis |journal=Journal of Design History|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |volume= 3|jstor=1315763|issue= 4|page=228}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1920s, Soviet [[Constructivism (art)|constructivism]] applied 'intellectual production' in different spheres of production. The movement saw individualistic art as useless in revolutionary Russia and thus moved towards creating objects for utilitarian purposes. They designed buildings, theater sets, posters, fabrics, clothing, furniture, logos, menus, etc.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

[[Jan Tschichold]] codified the principles of [[modern typography]] in his 1928 book, ''New Typography''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8CPmMRRx1DEC&amp;pg=PT333&amp;dq=Jan+Tschichold+codified+the+principles+of+modern+typography+in+his+1928+book,+New+Typography&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi0luGFltDYAhVGLmMKHdq3B18Q6AEIMDAB#v=onepage&amp;q=Jan%20Tschichold%20codified%20the%20principles%20of%20modern%20typography%20in%20his%201928%20book,%20New%20Typography&amp;f=false|title=Advertising Design and Typography|last=White|first=Alex W.|date=2010-09-21|publisher=Allworth Press|isbn=9781581158205|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180111150056/https://books.google.com/books?id=8CPmMRRx1DEC&amp;pg=PT333&amp;dq=Jan+Tschichold+codified+the+principles+of+modern+typography+in+his+1928+book,+New+Typography&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi0luGFltDYAhVGLmMKHdq3B18Q6AEIMDAB#v=onepage&amp;q=Jan%20Tschichold%20codified%20the%20principles%20of%20modern%20typography%20in%20his%201928%20book,%20New%20Typography&amp;f=false|archivedate=2018-01-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later repudiated the philosophy he espoused in this book as fascistic, but it remained influential.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} Tschichold, [[Bauhaus]] typographers such as [[Herbert Bayer]] and [[László Moholy-Nagy]] and [[El Lissitzky]] greatly influenced graphic design.

The following years saw graphic design in the modern style gain widespread acceptance and application.&lt;ref&gt;Crouch, Christopher. 2000. ''Modernism in Art Design and Architecture'', New York: [[St. Martins Press]]. {{ISBN|0-312-21830-3}} (cloth) {{ISBN|0-312-21832-X}} (pbk)&lt;/ref&gt; The post-World War II American economy revealed a greater need for graphic design, mainly in advertising and packaging. The spread of the German [[Bauhaus]] school of design to Chicago in 1937 brought a "mass-produced" minimalism to America; sparking "modern" [[architecture]] and design. Notable names in mid-century modern design include [[Adrian Frutiger]], designer of the [[typeface]]s [[Univers]] and [[Frutiger (typeface)|Frutiger]]; [[Paul Rand]], who took the principles of the Bauhaus and applied them to popular advertising and logo design, helping to create a uniquely American approach to European minimalism while becoming one of the principal pioneers of the subset of graphic design known as [[corporate identity]]; [[Alex Steinweiss]], credited with the invention of the album cover; and [[Josef Müller-Brockmann]], who designed posters in a severe yet accessible manner typical of the 1950s and 1970s era.

The professional graphic design industry grew in parallel with [[consumerism]]. This raised concerns and criticisms, notably from within the graphic design community with the [[First Things First 1964 manifesto|First Things First manifesto]]. First launched by [[Ken Garland]] in 1964, it was re-published as the [[First Things First 2000 manifesto]] in 1999 in the magazine ''[[Emigre (magazine)|Emigre]]'' 51&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.emigre.com/Editorial.php?sect=1&amp;id=14 |title=฿Emigre Essays |publisher=Emigre.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120106152041/http://emigre.com/Editorial.php?sect=1&amp;id=14 |archivedate=2012-01-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; stating "We propose a reversal of priorities in favor of more useful, lasting and democratic forms of communication - a mindshift away from product marketing and toward the exploration and production of a new kind of meaning. The scope of debate is shrinking; it must expand. Consumerism is running uncontested; it must be challenged by other perspectives expressed, in part, through the visual languages and resources of design."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://maxbruinsma.nl/index1.html?ftf2000.htm |title=max bruinsma |publisher=Maxbruinsma.nl |date= |accessdate=2012-01-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111219160927/http://maxbruinsma.nl/index1.html?ftf2000.htm |archivedate=2011-12-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both editions attracted signatures from practitioners and thinkers such as [[Rudy VanderLans]], [[Erik Spiekermann]], [[Ellen Lupton]] and [[Rick Poynor]]. The 2000 manifesto was also published in [[Adbusters]], known for its strong critiques of visual culture.

==Applications==
[[File:Secretary.jpg|thumb|[[Colour]]]]
Graphic design is applied to everything visual, from [[Traffic sign|road signs]] to technical schematics, from interoffice [[memorandum]]s to reference [[User guide|manuals]].

Design can aid in selling a [[Product (business)|product]] or [[idea]]. It is applied to products and elements of company identity such as [[logo]]s, colors, [[packaging]] and text as part of [[brand]]ing (see also [[advertising]]). Branding has become increasingly more important in the range of services offered by graphic designers. Graphic designers often form part of a branding team.

Graphic design is applied in the [[entertainment]] industry in decoration, scenery and visual story telling. Other examples of design for entertainment purposes include novels, vinyl [[album cover]]s, comic books, DVD covers, [[opening credits]] and [[closing credits]] in [[filmmaking]], and programs and props on stage. This could also include artwork used for T-shirts and other items screenprinted for sale.

From scientific journals to news reporting, the presentation of opinion and facts is often improved with graphics and thoughtful compositions of visual information - known as [[information design]]. Newspapers, magazines, blogs, television and film documentaries may use graphic design. With the advent of the web, information designers with experience in interactive tools are increasingly used to illustrate the background to news stories. Information design can include [[data visualization]], which involves using programs to interpret and form data into a visually compelling presentation, and can be tied in with [[information graphics]].

==Skills==
A graphic design project may involve the stylization and presentation of existing [[writing|text]] and either preexisting [[image]]ry or images developed by the graphic designer. Elements can be incorporated in both traditional and digital form, which involves the use of visual arts, typography, and page layout techniques. Graphic designers organize pages and optionally add graphic elements. Graphic designers can commission photographers or illustrators to create original pieces. Designers use digital tools, often referred to as [[interactive design]], or [[multimedia]] design. Designers need communication skills to convince an audience and sell their designs.

The "process school" is concerned with communication; it highlights the channels and media through which messages are transmitted and by which senders and receivers encode and decode these message. The semiotic school treats a message as a construction of signs which through interaction with receivers, produces meaning; communication as an agent.

===Typography===
{{Main article|Typography}}

Typography includes type design, modifying type [[glyphs]] and arranging type. Type glyphs (characters) are created and modified using illustration techniques. Type arrangement is the selection of typefaces, point size, tracking (the space between all characters used), kerning (the space between two specific characters) and leading (line spacing).

Typography is performed by typesetters, compositors, typographers, graphic artists, art directors and clerical workers. Until the digital age, typography was a specialized occupation. Certain fonts communicate or resemble stereotypical notions. For example 1942 Report is a font which types text akin to a typewriter or a vintage report.&lt;ref&gt;Butterick, Matthew. "Butterick's Practical Typography." Butterick's Practical Typography. Jones McClure, 2010-14. Web. 17 Feb. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Page layout===
{{Main article|Page layout}}
[[File:Golden section in book design.svg|thumb|Golden section in book design]]
Page layout deals with the arrangement of elements (content) on a page, such as image placement, text layout and style. Page design has always been a consideration in printed material and more recently extended to displays such as web pages. Elements typically consist of [[typography|type]] (text), [[image]]s (pictures), and (with print media) occasionally place-holder graphics such as a [[dieline]] for elements that are not printed with ink such as [[Die (manufacturing)|die]]/[[laser cutting]], [[foil stamping]] or [[Embossing (paper)|blind embossing]].

===Printmaking===
{{Main article|Printmaking}}

Printmaking is the process of making artworks by printing on [[paper]] and other materials or surfaces. The process is capable of producing multiples of the same work, each called a print. Each print is an original, technically known as an impression. Prints are created from a single original surface, technically a matrix. Common types of matrices include: plates of metal, usually copper or zinc for engraving or etching; stone, used for lithography; blocks of wood for woodcuts, linoleum for linocuts and fabric plates for screen-printing. Works printed from a single plate create an edition, in modern times usually each signed and numbered to form a limited edition. Prints may be published in book form, as artist's books. A single print could be the product of one or multiple techniques.[[Image:Pencils hb.jpg|thumb|The [[pencil]] is one of the most basic graphic design tools.]]

Aside from technology, graphic design requires [[judgment]] and [[creativity]]. Critical, observational, quantitative and analytic thinking are required for design layouts and [[artistic rendering|rendering]]. If the executor is merely following a solution (e.g. sketch, script or instructions) provided by another designer (such as an [[art director]]), then the executor is not usually considered the designer.

==Tools==
The method of presentation (e.g. Arrangements, style, medium) is important to the design. The development and presentation tools can change how an audience perceives a project. The image or layout is produced using [[media (arts)|traditional media]] and [[technical drawing tools|guides]], or [[digital image editing]] tools on computers. Tools in [[computer graphics]] often take on traditional names such as "scissors" or "[[pen]]". Some graphic design tools such as a [[Grid (graphic design)|grid]] are used in both traditional and digital form.

In the mid-1980s [[desktop publishing]] and [[graphic art software]] applications introduced computer image manipulation and creation capabilities that had previously been manually executed. Computers enabled designers to instantly see the effects of layout or typographic changes, and to simulate the effects of traditional media. Traditional tools such as [[pencil]]s can be useful even when computers are used for finalization; a designer or art director may sketch numerous concepts as part of the [[creative process]].&lt;ref&gt;Jacci Howard Bear, [http://desktoppub.about.com/cs/basic/a/thumbnails.htm?terms=squiggle desktoppub.about.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131206171848/http://desktoppub.about.com/cs/basic/a/thumbnails.htm?terms=squiggle |date=2013-12-06 }} Retrieved 2008-03-19&lt;/ref&gt; Styluses can be used with tablet computers to capture hand drawings digitally.&lt;ref&gt;[http://vimeo.com/6986303 Milton Glaser Draws &amp; Lectures] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140321100020/http://vimeo.com/6986303 |date=2014-03-21 }}. retrieved 31-01-2011&lt;/ref&gt;

===Computers and software===
Designers disagree whether computers enhance the creative process.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.designtalkboard.com/designtalk/index.php/topic,1030.0.html Designtalkboard.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070629214914/http://www.designtalkboard.com/designtalk/index.php/topic,1030.0.html |date=2007-06-29 }}, topic 1030 and [http://www.designtalkboard.com/designtalk/index.php/topic,1441.msg6356.html#msg6356 Designtalkboard.com], topic 1141. retrieved 3-18-2007&lt;/ref&gt; Some designers argue that computers allow them to explore multiple ideas quickly and in more detail than can be achieved by hand-rendering or [[paste up|paste-up]].&lt;ref&gt;Jann Lawrence Pollard and Jerry James Little, ''Creative Computer Tools for Artists: Using Software to Develop Drawings and Paintings,'' November 2001 Introduction&lt;/ref&gt; While other designers find the limitless choices from digital design can lead to paralysis or endless iterations with no clear outcome.

Most designers use a hybrid process that combines traditional and computer-based technologies. First, hand-rendered [[Comprehensive layout|layouts]] are used to get approval to execute an idea, then the polished visual product is produced on a computer.

Graphic designers are expected to be proficient in software programs for image-making, typography and layout. Nearly all of the popular and "industry standard" software programs used by graphic designers since the early 1990s are products of [[Adobe Systems]] Incorporated. [[Adobe Photoshop]] (a [[Raster scan|raster]]-based program for photo editing) and [[Adobe Illustrator]] (a vector-based program for drawing) are often used in the final stage. Designers often use pre-designed [[Raster graphics|raster images]] and [[vector graphics]] in their work from online design databases. Raster images may be edited in Adobe Photoshop, logos and illustrations in Adobe Illustrator, and the final product assembled in one of the major page layout programs, such as [[Adobe InDesign]], [[PagePlus|Serif PagePlus]] and [[QuarkXPress|QuarkXpress]]. Powerful open-source programs (which are free) are also used by both professionals and casual users for graphic design. These include [[Inkscape]] (for vector graphics), [[GIMP]] (for photo-editing and image manipulation), [[Krita]] (for painting) and [[Scribus]] (for page layout).

==Related design fields==
===Interface design===
{{Main article|User interface design}}
Since the advent of personal computers, many graphic designers have become involved in [[interface design]], in an environment commonly referred to as a [[Graphical user interface|Graphical User Interface]] (GUI). This has included [[web design]] and [[software design]], when [[end user]] [[interactivity]] is a design consideration of the layout or interface. Combining visual communication skills with an understanding of user interaction and online branding, graphic designers often work with [[software developer]]s and [[web developer]]s to create the [[look and feel]] of a web site or [[software application]]. An important aspect of interface design is [[icon design]].

===User experience design===
{{Main article|User experience design}}
User experience design is the study, analysis, and development of a person's interaction with a company or its products.

===Experiential graphic design===
{{Main article|Environmental Graphic Design}}

Experiential graphic design is the application of communication skills to the built environment. This area of graphic design requires practitioners to understand physical installations that have to be manufactured and withstand the same environmental conditions as buildings. As such, it is a cross-disciplinary collaborative process involving designers, fabricators, city planners, architects, manufacturers and construction teams.

Experiential graphic designers try to solve problems that people encounter while interacting with buildings and space. Examples of practice areas for environmental graphic designers are [[wayfinding]], [[placemaking]], branded environments, exhibitions and museum displays, public installations and digital environments.

==Occupations==
{{Main article|Graphic design occupations}}

Graphic design career paths cover all parts of the [[creative industries|creative spectrum]] and often overlap. Workers perform specialized tasks, such as design services, publishing, advertising and public relations. As of 2017, median pay was $48,700 per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bls.gov/ooh/arts-and-design/graphic-designers.htm|title=Graphic Designers: Occupational Outlook Handbook: U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics|last=|first=|date=|website=www.bls.gov|archiveurl=|archivedate=|deadurl=no|access-date=2018-06-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main job titles within the industry are often country specific. They can include [[graphic designer]], art director, [[creative director]], [[animator]] and entry level [[production artist]]. Depending on the industry served, the responsibilities may have different titles such as "[[DTP associate|DTP Associate]]" or "[[Graphic Artist]]". The responsibilities may involve specialized skills such as [[illustration]], [[photography]], [[animation]] or [[interactive design]].

Employment in design of online projects was expected to increase by 35% by 2026, while employment in traditional media, such as newspaper and book design, expect to go down by 22%. Graphic designers will be expected to constantly learn new techniques, programs, and methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bls.gov/ooh/arts-and-design/graphic-designers.htm#tab-6|title=Graphic Designers :     Occupational Outlook Handbook: :     U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics|website=www.bls.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2017-10-27|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171027215647/https://www.bls.gov/ooh/arts-and-design/graphic-designers.htm#tab-6|archivedate=2017-10-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Graphic designers can work within companies devoted specifically to the industry, such as design consultancies or branding agencies, others may work within publishing, marketing or other communications companies. Especially since the introduction of personal computers, many graphic designers work as in-house designers in non-design oriented organizations.  Graphic designers may also work [[Freelancer|freelance]], working on their own terms, prices, ideas, etc.

A graphic designer typically reports to the [[art director]], [[creative director]] or [[senior media creative]]. As a designer becomes more senior, they spend less time designing and more time leading and directing other designers on broader creative activities, such as [[brand]] development and [[corporate identity]] development. They are often expected to interact more directly with clients, for example taking and interpreting briefs.

===Crowdsourcing in graphic design===
{{Main article|Crowdsourcing creative work}}
Jeff Howe of ''[[Wired Magazine]]'' first used the term "[[crowdsourcing]]" in his 2006 article, "The Rise of Crowdsourcing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Howe|first=Jeff|title=The Rise of Crowdsourcing|url=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/14.06/crowds.html?pg=4&amp;topic=crowds&amp;topic_set=|publisher=WIRED Magazine|accessdate=24 October 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140209044356/http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/14.06/crowds.html?pg=4&amp;topic=crowds&amp;topic_set=|archivedate=9 February 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gilmour|first=Julia|title=The Long History of Crowdsourcing – and Why You’re Just Now Hearing About It|url=http://www.crowdsource.com/blog/2013/08/the-long-history-of-crowdsourcing-and-why-youre-just-now-hearing-about-it/|publisher=Crowdsource.com|accessdate=24 October 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140829172727/http://www.crowdsource.com/blog/2013/08/the-long-history-of-crowdsourcing-and-why-youre-just-now-hearing-about-it/|archivedate=29 August 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It spans such creative domains as graphic design, architecture, apparel design, writing, illustration etc. Tasks may be assigned to individuals or a group and may be categorized as convergent or divergent. An example of a divergent task is generating alternative designs for a poster. An example of a convergent task is selecting one poster design.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1432">'''Grosch medal''' (Grosch-medaljen) is a Norwegian architecture prize awarded bi-annually.

==Foundation and purpose==

The prize was established on the 200th anniversary of the birth of [[Christian Heinrich Grosch]], and the first medal was awarded to [[Sverre Fehn]] in 2001. The ceremony took place in the Old University Hall, Oslo, a room designed by Grosch.

Ron Daise's book ''Reminiscences of Sea Island Heritage'' was published in 1987.

It was named one of the 10 best children's shows by TV Guide in 1996 and in 1997 was nominated for a daytime Emmy in the preschool series category. The show was nominated twice for the NAACP Image Award and won two Parent's Choice Awards.  Ron, a native of St. Helena Island, S.C., and Natalie Daise have been performing together since 1983 and were married in 1985. They then began touring with their show, ''Sea Island Montage'', based on Ron's book ''Reminiscences of Sea Island Heritage'', in 1986.

''Gullah Gullah Island'' is a sing-along half-hour live-action show.&lt;ref name=CH2 /&gt;  The format was part of a "flexible thinking" initiative that taught children to make good choices rather than using rote memorization.&lt;ref name=BBMag /&gt;&lt;ref name=Trib&gt;{{cite news|last1=Managan|first1=Jennifer|title=Think For Yourself New Nick Shows Stress Reasoning Over Memorization|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1994-10-19/features/9410190022_1_gullah-gullah-island-ron-and-natalie-daise-happy-professor|accessdate=7 June 2014|publisher=Chicago Tribune|date=October 19, 1994|quote="Gullah Gullah Island." The shows are part of a reported $30 million initiative to expand Nick Jr., the cable network's preschool block (8 a.m. to 1 p.m.) weekdays and to promote "flexible thinking," an approach the network says encourages kids to think on their own when making choices rather than using rote memorization.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The series revolves around a family headed by Ron and Natalie Daise, playing fictionalized versions of themselves, known as The Alstons, set on the fictional "Gullah Gullah Island".  Additional cast featured the Daise's actual children Simeon and Sara among others, including a full-body puppet [[frog]], Binyah Binyah ('Binyah' is the Gullah word for 'island native'.)&lt;ref name=Smth&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hendry|first1=Erica|title=Holding on to Gullah Culture  A Smithsonian curator visits a Georgia island to find stories of a shrinking community that has clung to its African traditions|website=Smithsonian.org|publisher=Smithsonian Magazine|date=March 2011|quote=Bailey drove Amos around the island in a boxy utility van, pointing out houses and fields and slipping into island dialect: binya is a native islander, comya is a visitor. r}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show was taped and recorded at [[Nickelodeon Studios]] in Orlando at [[Universal Studios Florida]], with the show ''[[Clarissa Explains It All]]'' shot on the same set (interior and exterior).&lt;ref name=Spoleto /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sun Sentinel"&gt;{{cite web|last1=On TV|title=Polliwog Helps Bring Gullah Culture To Life|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1996-07-07/entertainment/9606260243_1_natalie-daise-gullah-gullah-island-preschool-show|publisher=Sun Sentinel|accessdate=8 June 2014|date=July 7, 1996|quote=Gullah Gullah Island, the first preschool show centered on a black family, is the network's top-rated live action preschool show with an estimated 767,000 children between ages 2 and 5 watching daily.The Daises live in nearby Beaufort with their children, 6-year-old Sara and 3-year-old Simeon, who are both in the cast. The show's rising popularity has forced them to get an unlisted number, but fans and their parents still seem to find their way to the Daises' doorstep.  Since last fall, the network has licensed a series of children's books, videos, CDs and cassettes. The first of the Binyah Binyah Polliwog plush animals hit the stores in April.  The children in the cast are consulted about the dancing and dialogue in the show.  "We use `kiddieography' instead of choreography," said choreographer Ken Grant as he watched Vinson take another angle on the beach.  The cast, which includes three child actors in addition to the Daises' two children, tapes exteriors for about three weeks each year near Beaufort.

Ron, who grew up on St. Helena Island as a native Gullah, wrote a book titled "Reminiscences of Sea Island Heritage" that included a collection of islander memoirs and spirituals. He and Natalie toured the country performing original productions of songs and stories depicting Gullah legends and lore, which eventually spawned the TV series.

There will be familiar songs and stories and children will be encouraged to participate. But Ron doesn't want to say too much about the theme of the low-tech touring show.  "It's to encourage the children to use their imaginations to pretend," is all he will say. "I'd like it to be a surprise for the audience."  A big difference between the television show and the touring show is there's a lot less dialogue without the presence of the show's close-knit "family" of three children and relatives and friends. The Daises' own children, Simeon, 4, and Sara, 7, both act on the television show.  The touring show started as a 30-minute live gig at bookstores and malls. It was called "Nick Jr. Story and Song Play Along." The crowds were so large that in January, Nickelodeon launched a 1-1/2-hour show for larger venues.  Going on the road was old hat for Ron and Natalie, who, before "Gullah Gullah Island," traveled the country for a decade performing "Sea Island Montage," a two-person show featuring the songs and stories of the Gullah people.  They also have toured extensively to promote their independently produced books and records, including Ron's children's book "Little Muddy Waters: A Gullah Folk Tale" and the recently released recording "Sleep Tight: Lullabies &amp; Night-Night Stories."  Ron said that he and Natalie aren't terribly disappointed they won't be making any more "Gullah Gullah Island" shows. After all, he said, they have shot four seasons of shows already, a year more than Nickelodeon's standard three-year production for successful pre-school shows. There may be some specials. And they know the show will inspire generations of pre-schoolers to come through syndication.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Episodes are presented with a unified plot and not separate segments, featuring singing, dancing, learning and encouraging children to think about things like taking care of yourself, animals, telling the truth, social skills, and problem solving.&lt;ref name=Trib /&gt;&lt;ref name=FreelanceStar&gt;{{cite news|last1=Smith|first1=Bruce (AP Writer)|title=GaGa over Gullah|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1298&amp;dat=19960606&amp;id=AtYyAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=ywcGAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5631,1065301|accessdate=8 June 2014|agency=Associated Press|publisher=Freelance-Star|date=June 6, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show also highlights the culture and language of [[Gullah]], descendants of former slaves who live on the Sea Islands off the coast of South Carolina and Georgia.&lt;ref name=MornCall /&gt;

==Reception==

===Critical reception===
Critical reception of the show was consistently positive; both as a children's show and as groundbreaker for African American programming, it was praised for "vividly colored sets, infectious sing-alongs, unique character accents and quirky humor that defined the show and introduced millions of children to an overlooked but centuries-old branch of African American culture."&lt;ref name=Purdue2&gt;{{cite news |last1=Novak |first1=Tom|title=BCC brings creators of '90s nostalgia heavy kids' show 'Gullah Gullah Island' to Fowler |url=http://www.purdueexponent.org/features/article_e67fd4f8-0501-53b0-b84b-2cfe8ced53c1.html|accessdate=8 June 2014|publisher=Purdue University |date=September 5, 2013|quote=Some may be a little too young to remember, but many students won't be able to forget the vividly colored sets, infectious sing-alongs, unique character accents and quirky humor that defined the show and introduced millions of children to an overlooked but centuries-old branch of African American culture.  The Gullah culture exists on the rice plantation islands of South Carolina and southern Georgia, where slaves from Sierra Leone were taken to work at because of their knowledge of rice farming. Because bridges were not built to these islands until the mid 20th century, their culture remained isolated and free to develop on its own. It is one of the most well-preserved African American cultures, even with its own language, a mixture of English and West African dialects – much like Creole is to French.  Just as the TV show was based upon a model of "call-and-response" taken from Gullah culture,}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was described as "a combination summer camp, cheerleading session and music video."&lt;ref name=SSENT2&gt;{{cite news|title=Polliwog Helps Bring Gullah Culture To Life|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1996-07-07/entertainment/9606260243_1_natalie-daise-gullah-gullah-island-preschool-show|accessdate=8 June 2014|agency=Features|publisher=Sun Sentinel|date=July 7, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; The issues, especially with the first season, had to do with show's depiction being unrealistic. "The songs were lively and catchy, the kids were cute and the general theme was unlike other kids' programming," Jenifer Managan of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' wrote. However:

&lt;blockquote&gt;... it stars "perfect" parents, Ron and Natalie Daise, who with their three children (who never fight), neighbors and friends seek to entertain and socially educate kids through a sing-song series. While the show encourages active participation from at-home viewers, the dictionary responses and incomparable energy from the Daises make normal parents look like misfits. Perhaps as the show seasons, the lip-syncing will improve and the characters won't be so picture-perfect.&lt;ref name=Gullahbaloo /&gt;&lt;ref name=Trib /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==''Binyah Binyah!''==
In 1997, five episodes of a ''Gullah Gullah Island'' miniseries titled ''Binyah Binyah!'' were produced at the now-defunct [[Nickelodeon Studios]] in Orlando, Florida, and aired from February 2 to February 6, 1998.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lyonpuppets.com/binyah.html&lt;/ref&gt; A separate theme song written by [[Sean Altman]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.seanaltman.com/sean97b.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; was given to these episodes. The miniseries also featured several new puppet characters in addition to the original cast, and focused on polliwog Binyah Binyah journeying to locations outside of Gullah Gullah. Ron and Natalie Daise were a part of the cast as well.&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.courant.com/1998-02-22/news/9802210141_1_gullah-gullah-island-puerto-rico-perez-family/5&lt;/ref&gt; It was never broadcast again after its initial airing of episodes, nor was it released to home video. A promo advertising the series' debut is the only known footage; all five episodes were believed to be lost until 2017, when snippets of episode 5 and all of episode 4 surfaced online, evidently coming from a homemade VHS tape of old Nickelodeon shows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Yesterworld: 5 Lost, Destroyed, and Locked Away Television Episodes &amp; Broadcasts |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5e4r4qVIEo |website=YouTube |publisher=Yesterworld Entertainment |accessdate=22 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3254">'''Howard Brodie''' (November 18, 1915 – September 19, 2010) was a [[Sketch (drawing)|sketch artist]] best known for his [[World War II]] combat and courtroom sketches.

==Pre-war career==
Brodie was born in [[Oakland, California]], on November 18, 1915. He briefly attended [[California School of Fine Arts]], [[San Francisco]]. When [[World War II]] started, Howard Brodie was a sports artist for the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]''. Brodie also enjoyed success as an illustrator of college football program covers.

==Combat sketches==
[[File:Yank, The Army Weekly, April 13, 1945, Cover art of Rifle Company Medic.jpg|right|thumb|140px|Brodie's 1945 sketch of a Rifle Company Medic]]
With entry of the United States into [[World War II]], Brodie enlisted in the Army. He became one of ''[[Yank, the Army Weekly|Yank]]'' magazine's best-known artists during the war. He sketched everything from [[Guadalcanal]] to the [[Battle of the Bulge]] and had an uncanny ability to capture the emotions of his subjects and record a scene with great attention to detail.

He put himself in combat situations many times and, while he never carried a weapon, he worked as a medic when needed. He received the [[Bronze Star Medal|Bronze Star]] for valor.&lt;ref name="NYT obit"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/24/arts/design/24brodie.html?hpw |title=Howard Brodie, 94, Combat and Courtroom Artist, Dies |author=William Grimes |newspaper=The New York Times |date=September 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Courtroom sketches==
After the war Brodie became a courtroom artist and recorded many famous trials, including those of the [[Chicago Seven]], [[Charles Manson]] and [[General Westmoreland]], the [[Jack Ruby|Ruby trial]] and Senate Civil Rights Debates. He was also a [[CBS]] TV Artist-Correspondent. Brodie never fully severed his ties to the military and was a combat artist in [[Korea]], [[French Indochina]], and [[Vietnam]]. His works can be found in the [[Library of Congress]].

==Famous works==
Two of Brodie's most famous works are "Portrait of a Medic", which appeared on the cover of Yank Magazine, and "Compassion". Another sketch, which depicted an exhausted [[G.I. (military)|G.I.]] dropping his rifle as [[World War II]] ended, appeared on the cover of Yank’s Continental Edition on August 19, 1945.  Brodie's works are collected in ''Drawing Fire: A Combat Artist at War Pacific Europe Korea Indochina Vietnam''.

As ''The New York Times'' has stated, "His sketch of the black militant Bobby Seale gagged and strapped to his chair became the image that epitomized the trial of the Chicago Seven, the leaders of protests at the 1968 Democratic National Convention."&lt;ref name="NYT obit" /&gt;

'''''Jacob wrestling with the Angel''''' is a [[mural]] painted by [[Eugène Delacroix]]. Painted toward the end of his life, from 1854–1861, it depicts a puzzling episode from [[The Bible]]'s [[Book of Genesis]],  XXXII, 22-32 - [[Jacob wrestling with the angel]]. The painting decorates the wall of the Chapel of the Holy Angels in the Paris church of [[Saint-Sulpice, Paris|Saint-Sulpice]].   Another mural by Delacroix, ''Heliodorus Driven from the Temple'', drawn from  the Book of the [[Maccabees]], a scene of someone  taking a beating in the [[Jerusalem Temple]], is also there.
 
[[File:Eugène Ferdinand Victor Delacroix 061.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Eugène Delacroix]]|''Jacob wrestling with the Angel'' 1854-1861]]

[[File:Eugène Delacroix - Heliodoros Driven from the Temple - WGA06222 (cropped).jpg|thumb|230px|''Heliodorus Driven from the Temple'']]

In an invitation sent out by Delacroix in July 1861 to inspect the Chapel of the Holy Angels in the church of Saint-Sulpice he wrote : "Jacob is travelling with the flocks and other gifts he is taking to his brother [[Esau]] in the hope of appeasing his anger. A stranger appears, blocking his path, and engages him in a fierce struggle - The holy books see this struggle as a symbol of the trials God sometimes sends His chosen ones. "  Delacroix does not indicate in what holy books he found such an interpretation.

[[Maurice Barres]] wrote that it was 'a final page of autobiography, a summary of the experience of a great life, the last will and testament written by an old artist on the wall of the Angels'.  He called it Delacroix's  'spiritual testament ' --
although the French writer [[Jean-Paul Kauffmann]] calls Barres' book ''Mystere en pleine lumiere'' [ The mystery in Full Daylight] -- 'certainly questionable on the significance of the scene painted by Delacroix'.&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Paul Kauffmann, Wrestling With the Angel: The Mystery of Delacroix's Mural,  transl. Patricia Clancy (London: Harvill Press, 2003).&lt;/ref&gt;

In Delacroix's composition, a caravan procession--a convoy of servants, flocks, Jacob's sons and wives--appears then fades, only to reappear briefly at the bend of a ravine. Three huge trees dominate the scene; the gorge with misty contours is the painting's final destination.  Thereby, Jacob's life is represented in two parts, as he is not to be the same after the depicted fight.  'He bears the mark for ever in his flesh',  victorious but wounded, whereas before the meeting with the angel he is all tricks and cheating.  Thus Delacroix depicted a pile of clothes left in the foreground by Jacob, as he has still his bulky animal skin, symbol of animal human nature and the lower instincts, and wears a lion skin across his shoulder: one of whose paws can be seen flying in the air near his right calf. [[Paul Claudel]] wrote of the femininity of the angel attacked by a vigorous young man: 'these two bodies becoming aware of each other'

Delacroix's house close to Paris  on the edge of the [[The Forest of Sénart|Sénart forest]] was his retreat during the work and conception of Jacob. He left Champrosay in the morning, took the train to Ris station, and returned in the evening to sleep at the hermitage. "Nature as depicted [here] is not very eastern--the stream, the vegetation, the rise with the three trees definitely belong to the landscape of the [[Ile de France]]--Senart forest.  Delacroix liked to walk in the woods and be around the decomposing organic matter--had a  saprophiliac side to his nature--a fascination with destruction and putrefaction, squelching in mud and breathing in the air of the secluded paths". (Kauffman)

Delacroix wanted to work in the church on Sundays.  There were sung masses and the music inspired him.  When the Abbé Croquant objected, Delacroix went as far as to request the Emperor and Empress to intervene. 
 
Preparing the wall in Sant-Sulpice--worried by absorption (walls swallow liquid preparations)--"the great enemy is the dampness of the walls:in short the walls are dreadful for any paint. Oil, sinking in to a great depth, can compensate for the drawback." The Chapel faces south, so Delacroix played with the light flowing in directly through the window--a solar architecture -  [[Gnomon of Saint-Sulpice]]
Gnomon astronomicus - the threat of lead poisoning, brought on by breathing the lead n paint -  the walls contain [[white-lead]].

'Jacob' is set in an uneven hilly surface.  Delacroix, who above all studied Rubens, admired the thickness of [[Rubens']] paint and the way its impasto stands out from surfaces. The Historic Monuments research laboratory has identified an incredible number of layers: indeed, the Angel's robe has up to thirteen.

In 1856 Delacroix was suffering from tubercular laryngitis,the illness that would kill him.  A [[varicocele]] torments him as its testicular trouble flares up. The nature of his work on the mural 'means that he is always either standing or perched up on a ladder, increasing his discomfort.'

[[File:Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot 047.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Delacroix  admired the way [[Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot|Corot]]  painted trees-  :it was at Champrosay Delacroix came to think they 'should be built up in tints of light like flesh']]  
[[Image:François-Joseph Heim - Study for Destruction of Jerusalem by the Romans - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|280px|[[François-Joseph Heim]] decorated the Chapel of the Souls in Purgatory, the one next to the Holy Angels--his work a ''prayer for the dead'' (now burnt) and ''Religion Exhorting the Christian to Suffer''--above, a work of his called,  Destruction of jerusalem by the Romans]]
"The names of angels - what is your name?" Jacob asks at the end of the fight.

On 28 December 1857 Delacroix moved his lodgings from rue Notre Dame de Lorette to no6 Rue Furstenberg to be nearer Saint-Sulpice, and by 22 July 1861 he had finished the Chapel of the Holy Angels.  He had only two more years to live, time spent most of it in his refuge at Champrosay.

1938 - damaged by sandbags

''Deliver me out of the mire, and let me not sink'' -Psalm 69  verse 14 - this is the inscription over the entrance to the Chapel of the Holy Angels.
In October 1858 Delacroix wrote to Berryer, 'I have made a solid effort. I think it will save the work, which was probably bogged down.'

On 28 April 1849, the Ministry of the Interior officially commissions Delacroix to do the  mural paintings for the Font Chapel  - its name at that time -  he had chosen  subjects to do with [[original sin]], washed away by [[baptism]] -  He is 51. He will get 26,826 francs  - He learns that the chapel, wrongly called Font Chapel because the baptismal font  was temporarily placed there, is dedicated to  St Sulpice - On 2 October 1849, it changes name - and this time invokes the Holy Angels. The change obliges Delacroix to look for other themes. He writes in his journal  'The justifiable anger I felt has really knocked me about.'  On 5 October 1850 he  reveals in a letter to  a friend, the painter [[Constant Dutilleux]] his subjects, and mentions Jacob wrestling with the angel, Heliodorus, and  the ceiling,  which will have as its subject  ''the [[Archangel Michael]]  slaying the Demon''.  From 1850-54 Delacroix is busy with another commission however,  the decoration of the Hall of Peace in the Town Hall and then, on 16 June 1854 writes in his Journal -  "Andrieu has begun work at Saint-Sulpice." Pierre Andrieu, was a pupil of Delacroix,  before becoming his collaborator from 1850 onwards.

Heim's work  in chapel of souls in purgatory on other side of wall to delacroixs mural - 'prayer for the dead' - less looked at- there was a confessional in the chapel of the holy angels - placed beneath wrestling with the angel, enroached on the bottom part of the painting - it was moved - to the heim chapel  beneath heims prayer for the dead -

Kauffmann - [[Titian]] ''The Martyrdom of St Peter'' - inspiration for delacroix?

'''Jonathan Crary''', is an [[art critic]] and [[essayist]], and is Meyer Schapiro Professor of Modern Art and Theory at [[Columbia University in New York]].  His first notable works were ''Techniques of the Observer: On Vision and Modernity in the 19th Century'' (1990), and ''Suspensions of Perception: Attention, Spectacle and Modern Culture'' (2000). He has published critical essays for over 30 [[Exhibition catalogue]]s, mostly on [[contemporary art]].  His style is often classified{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} as observational mixed with scientific, and a dominant theme in his work is the role of the human eye.

==Biography==
Crary attended high school at the [[The Putney School|Putney School]] in Vermont. He graduated from [[Columbia College, Columbia University|Columbia College]] where he was an art history major. In 1987 he received his Ph.D from Columbia as well. Crary also earned a B.F.A. from the [[San Francisco Art Institute]], where he studied film and photography.

He first taught at the Visual Arts Department at [[University of California, San Diego]]. In 1989 he began teaching at Columbia.

==Writing==
His ''Suspensions of Perception'' focuses on the period from about 1880 to 1905, exploring the second half of the nineteenth century in which a new way of seeing was introduced. Crary describes this shift as an emergence of subjective vision. In addition, Crary discusses how Attention became a “new object within the modernization of [[subjectivity]]...”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Crary|first=Jonathan|title=Suspensions of perception : attention, spectacle, and modern culture|year=2001|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts [u.a.]|isbn=0-262-53199-2|edition=1. MIT Press paperback}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crary’s book examines how the perception of various cultures were reconstructed and uncertainties were argued. This new development of vision created [[controversy]] because it implied that seeing was dependent upon one’s subjective thoughts, which were based on what the observer saw. Therefore, this new way of seeing was thought of as unclear, unreliable, and always questioned among a large population of people. ''Suspensions of Perception'' published in 2000 was the winner of the 2001 Lionel Trilling Book Award.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.columbia.edu/cu/arthistory/faculty/Crary.html Meyer Schapiro Professor of Modern Art and Theory and Director of Art Humanities, Jonathan Crary]&lt;/ref&gt;

Crary's ''Techniques of the Observer'' gives a unique study on the origins of modern [[visual culture]]. ''Techniques of the Observer'' was published in 1990 and translated into nine foreign languages.

Crary has also written on present day “art  and culture for publications including [[Art in America]], [[Artforum]], [[October (journal)|October]], [[Assemblage (journal)|Assemblage]], [[Cahiers du cinéma|Cahiers du Cinema]], [[Film Comment]], [[Grey Room]], [[Domus (magazine)|Domus]] and [[Village Voice]].”{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} Crary is also a critic and wrote critical essays for more than thirty exhibition catalogs. Crary has contributed to the Film Theory and Criticism anthology. eds Braudy &amp; Cohen 7th edition.

Crary was one of the founders of [http://www.zonebooks.org/ Zone Books] in 1986, which is a press known for publications in “History, art theory, politics, anthropology and philosophy".{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} In addition, literature by [[Michel Foucault]], [[Giorgio Agamben]], [[Gilles Deleuze]], and others are included. Crary was co-editor of the 1992 volume ''Incorporations'' (Zone Books).

The '''Kentucky Foundation for Women'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kfw.org KFW Home&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; promotes feminist art and [[social justice]] by awarding grants to individual artists and organizations, providing time and space for artists and activists at its retreat center, sharing information, and building alliances.

The Kentucky Foundation for Women is a 501(c)3 private, independent foundation that was established in 1985 by author [[Sallie Bingham]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.salliebingham.com SallieBingham.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Louisville, Kentucky]]. At the time, Ms. Bingham's philanthropic gift of $10 million was the largest endowment to any women's fund in the United States. The mission of the Kentucky Foundation for Women is "to promote positive [[social change]] by supporting varied feminist expression in the arts."&lt;ref name="kfw.org"&gt;Kentucky Foundation for Women website http://www.kfw.org&lt;/ref&gt;

The foundation funds two grant programs annually, they are ''Artist Enrichment'' and ''Arts Meets Activism''. Both grant programs are artist-centered, feminist in nature, and demonstrate high artistic quality. Applicants to both programs are expected to be able to express their commitment to [[feminism]] and their understanding of the relationship between art and social change.

Grant awards range from $1,000 to $7,500 per project. Social change, as defined by the foundation, includes "eliminating societal barriers to women: neutralizing discrimination against women based on age, ethnicity, [[sexual orientation]], physical ability, economic condition, and geographic origin; and producing actions, conditions, policies, attitudes, and behaviors that benefit women."&lt;ref&gt;"The Perfect Marriage" by Kopana Terry, ''Arts Across Kentucky Magazine'', Spring 2003, pages 55-57&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1985 and 2005 the Kentucky Foundation for Women awarded 1298 grants to individuals and organizations totaling $7,140,831.

[[Image:Hopscotch House.JPG|left]]'''Hopscotch House''' is a program of the Kentucky Foundation for Women; it is first and foremost an artist retreat center for feminist artists. It is also used by a variety of groups and organizations that are working to better the lives of women and girls in Kentucky.

Hopscotch House was purchased by the Kentucky Foundation for Women in 1987 and was first used by a group of [[Women\'s fiction|women writers]] known as the Wolf Pen Writer's Colony. In the early 1990s Hopscotch House became available to other [[women artists]] and women's groups. Over the years, Hopscotch House has served hundreds of women including artists, activists, feminists, eco-feminists, art critique groups, drumming circles, quilting groups, social justice groups, girls' empowerment groups, arts organizations, and [[Social work|social service]] organizations.

The property is considered a "classic" Kentucky farmstead and is located 13 miles east of [[downtown Louisville]]. The house has five bedrooms, six bathrooms, a library of women's literature and [[reference work]]s, a large living room/dining area, a sun room, and a deck. The large kitchen is fully furnished and well equipped so that residents can prepare their own meals. Separate studio space for artists is available upon request.&lt;ref name="kfw.org"/&gt;

==Other activities and support==

The Kentucky Foundation for Women has provided financial gifts for special projects such as the '''National Sculpture Conference: Works by Women''' held in [[Cincinnati, Ohio]] in 1987. The conference honored American women sculptors ages 67–88. The honorees were: [[Selma Burke]], [[Elizabeth Catlett]], Clyde Connell, [[Dorothy Dehner]], Louise Bourgeois [https://www.pbs.org/art21/artists/bourgeois/index.html], [[Claire Falkenstein]], Sue Fuller, Louise Nevelson&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.louisenevelsonfoundation.org/ Louise Nevelson Foundation&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Claire Zeisler]].&lt;ref&gt;"Women Sculptors Have Their Say" by Elizabeth Bookser Barkley, ''Tristate Magazine, The Cincinnati Enquirer'', April 26, 1987, pages 3–16.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Hot Flash Fan''', purchased by the foundation, was a collaborative project completed by more than 50 artists. "The project is a fan incorporating needlework, knotting, quilting, and painting in an expression of feelings associated with menopause."&lt;ref&gt;[http://oasis.lib.harvard.edu/oasis/deliver/~sch00326 Chicago, Judy, 1939- . Papers, 1947-2004 (inclusive), 1957-2004 (bulk): A Finding Aid&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Lead artists for the project were: [[Judy Chicago]], facilitator; [[Ann Stewart Anderson]], originator and principal coordinating artist; Ada O'Connor, principal embroidery artist/coordinator; Judith Myers, quilting coordinator. The Hot Flash Fan was on display at the [[Water tower|Water Tower]], home of the Louisville Visual [[Art association|Art Association]], before being added to the Foundation's permanent collection.

The Kentucky Foundation for Women published 50 issues of the [[Literary magazine|literary journal]] '''''The American Voice''''', which featured international and Kentucky writers. The editor of the Pan-American journal was Frederick Smock and was published trianually from 1986 to 1999. During that time ''The American Voice'' published two stories that were awarded the [[Pushcart Prize]] that honors the best poetry, [[Short story|short fiction]], and essays published in the small presses. It was a feminist publication that was known for featuring works by well-known authors such as [[Joyce Carol Oates]], [[Isabel Allende]], and [[Reynolds Price]] alongside Kentuckians [[Wendell Berry]], [[James Still]], and [[Sena Jeter Naslund]]. The journal also nurtured the work of less established, home-grown talent and published early work by the award-winning poet Aleda Shirley, novelist [[Barbara Kingsolver]], playwright [[Naomi Wallace]], and children's author George Ella Lyon.&lt;ref&gt;"Editor aims to bring Kentucky into the literary mainstream" by Ira Simmons, ''The Courier-Journal'', May 1, 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sallie Bingham Award===
The '''Sallie Bingham Award''' was established in 1996 to recognize individuals and groups who have made outstanding contributions toward changing the lives of Kentucky women through feminist expression in the arts. Recipients are given a $500 cash award, a [[Gold plating|gold-plated]] Ginko pin and plaque. The award is announced at KFW Day, an annual celebration held each fall at Hopscotch House.

'''''Klingen''''' (meaning ''Blade'' in English) was a [[Danish language|Danish]] art magazine based in [[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]]. The magazine existed between 1917 and 1920.

==History and profile==
''Klingen'' was established in 1917 and the first issue appeared in October 1917.&lt;ref name=bsb&gt;Bjarne S. Bendtsen.

Major contributors were Otto Gelsted, [[Emil Bønnelycke]], [[Poul Henningsen]] and Sophus Danneskjold-Samsøe.&lt;ref name=bsb/&gt; ''Klingen'' ceased publication in November 1920 and a total of thirty-six issues was published.&lt;ref name="petsa"/&gt; In 1942 an anniversary issue was published.&lt;ref name="petsa"/&gt;

}}'''Lesli Linka Glatter''' (born July 26, 1953) is an American film and television director. She is best known for her work on the American drama series ''[[Homeland (TV series)|Homeland]]''.

==Life and career==
Glatter was born in Dallas, Texas to [[Jewish]] parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jewishjournal.com/old_stories/818/|title=Finding Faith — Jewish Journal|first=William|last=Yelles|publisher=|accessdate=26 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; She began her career as a dancer and [[choreographer]]. Her early choreography credits include [[William Friedkin]]'s ''To Live and Die in L.A'' and the music video for [[Sheila E.]]'s "[[The Glamorous Life]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Birnbaum |first=Debra |date=12 September 2017 |title=Lesli Linka Glatter: 'It's Time That This Isn't an Issue Anymore'|magazine=Variety |location=Los Angeles |publisher= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0322128/bio|title=Lesli Linka Glatter|website=IMDb|access-date=30 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her first film, ''Tales of Meeting and Parting'' (1984), produced by [[Sharon Oreck]], was nominated for an [[Academy Award]] in the [[Academy Award for Live Action Short Film|Live Action Short Film]] category.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=List Of Academy Award Nominations |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1985-02-07/entertainment/ca-5459_1?pg=2 |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=February 7, 1985 |accessdate=October 11, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  She made the film as part of the [[American Film Institute]] Directing Workshop for Women, of which she is an alumna.

In 1995, Glatter directed her first feature film [[Now and Then (film)|''Now and Then'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=From 'Homeland' to 'Mad Men,' Lesli Linka Glatter calls the shots|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/tv/la-et-st-lesli-linka-glatter-20170114-story.html |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=January 14, 2017 |accessdate=October 1, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A coming-of-age story about four 12-year-old girls during an eventful summer in 1970.

She has made several television films for cable networks, but the majority of her work is in television series. Glatter has received four nominations for the [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Directing for a Drama Series]], for the ''[[Mad Men]]'' episode "[[Guy Walks Into an Advertising Agency]]" (2009), and the ''[[Homeland (TV series)|Homeland]]'' episodes "[[Q&amp;A (Homeland)|Q&amp;A]]" (2012), "[[From A to B and Back Again]]" (2014) and "[[The Tradition of Hospitality]]" (2015).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.emmys.com/bios/lesli-linka-glatter |title=Lesli Linka Glatter |publisher=Emmys.com |accessdate=July 15, 2016}},&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018 it was announced that Glatter would serve as chair on the advisory council for [[NBC]]'s Female Forward. An annual initiative to give ten women directors the opportunity to shadow a director on one of [[NBC]]'s scripted television series for up to three episodes. The experience concludes with an in-season commitment for each finalist to direct at least one episode of the series they shadow.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://variety.com/2018/tv/news/nbc-female-forward-directors-lesli-linka-glatter-1202657990/|title=NBC Sets Advisors, Submission Process for Female Forward Directors Initiative|website=Variety|access-date=30 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Liberty Leading the People''''' ({{lang-fr|La Liberté guidant le peuple}} {{IPA-fr|la libɛʁte ɡidɑ̃ lə pœpl|}}) is a painting by [[Eugène Delacroix]] commemorating the [[July Revolution]] of 1830, which toppled King [[Charles X of France|Charles X]] of France. A woman personifying [[Liberty|the concept]] and the [[Liberty (goddess)|Goddess of Liberty]] leads the people forward over a barricade and the bodies of the fallen, holding the flag of the [[French Revolution]] – the [[Flag of France|tricolour]], which again became France's national flag after these events – in one hand and brandishing a bayonetted [[musket]] with the other. The figure of Liberty is also viewed as a symbol of France and the French Republic known as [[Marianne]].

== History ==
By the time Delacroix painted ''Liberty Leading the People'', he was already the acknowledged leader of the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] school in French painting.&lt;ref&gt;Noon et al. 2003, p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt; Delacroix, who was born as the [[Age of Enlightenment]] was giving way to the ideas and style of romanticism, rejected the emphasis on precise drawing that characterised the [[academic art]] of his time, and instead gave a new prominence to freely brushed colour.

Delacroix painted his work in the autumn of 1830. In a letter to his brother dated 21 October, he wrote: "My bad mood is vanishing thanks to hard work. I’ve embarked on a modern subject—a [[barricade]]. And if I haven’t fought for my country at least I’ll paint for her." The painting was first exhibited at the official [[Paris Salon|Salon]] of 1831.

== Symbolism ==
Delacroix depicted Liberty as both an [[allegory|allegorical]] goddess-figure and a robust woman of the people. The mound of corpses acts as a kind of [[pedestal]] from which Liberty strides, barefoot and bare-breasted, out of the canvas and into the space of the viewer. The [[Phrygian cap]] she wears had come to symbolize liberty during the first [[French Revolution]], of 1789. The painting has been seen as a marker to the end of the Age of Enlightenment, as many scholars see the end of the French Revolution as the start of the [[Romanticism|romantic era]].&lt;ref name="Rise of the Romantic Era"&gt;Renwick, William Lindsay (1889). ''The Rise of the Romantics 1789–1815: Wordsworth, Coleridge, and Jane Austen''. Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1990, c1963 {{ISBN|978-0198122371}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fighters are from a mixture of social classes, ranging from the bourgeoisie represented by the young man in a [[top hat]], a student from the prestigious [[École Polytechnique]] wearing the traditional [[bicorne]], to the revolutionary urban worker, as exemplified by the boy holding pistols. What they have in common is the fierceness and determination in their eyes. Aside from the flag held by Liberty, a second, minute [[Flag of France|''tricolore'']] can be discerned in the distance flying from the towers of [[Notre Dame de Paris|Notre Dame]].&lt;ref&gt;Boime, Albert (2004). [https://books.google.com/books?id=24Hgr0U8K3QC&amp;pg=PA237&amp;dq= ''Art in an Age of Counterrevolution, 1815–1848]. Chicago: University of Chicago Press. p. 237. {{ISBN|978-0226063379}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The identity of the man in the top hat has been widely debated. The suggestion that it was a self-portrait by Delacroix has been discounted by modern art historians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Toussaint| first=Hélene| year=1982| title=La Liberté guidant le peuple de Delacroix| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CpnqAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=La%20Libert%C3%A9%20guidant%20le%20peuple%20de%20Delacroix&amp;source=gbs_book_other_versions| location=Paris| publisher=Editions de la Réunion des Musées Nationaux| subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 19th century, it was suggested the model was the theatre director [[Étienne Arago]]; others have suggested the future curator of the [[Louvre]], [[Frédéric Villot]];&lt;ref name="Pool33"&gt;Pool 1969, p.33.&lt;/ref&gt; but there is no firm consensus on this point.

Several of the figures are probably borrowed from a print by popular artist  [[Nicolas Charlet]], a prolific illustrator who Delacroix believed captured, more than anyone else, the peculiar energy of the Parisians.&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt;

== Purchase and exhibition ==
The French government bought the painting in 1831 for 3,000 [[French franc|francs]] with the intention of displaying it in the throne room of the [[Palais du Luxembourg]] as a reminder to the "citizen-king" [[Louis-Philippe of France|Louis-Philippe]] of the July Revolution, through which he had come to power. This plan did not come to fruition and the canvas hung in the palace's museum gallery for a few months, before being removed due to its inflammatory political message. After the [[June Rebellion]] of 1832, it was returned to the artist. According to [[Albert Boime]],

&lt;blockquote&gt;Champfleury wrote in August 1848 that it had been “hidden in an attic for being too revolutionary.” Although Louis-Philippe's Ministry of the Interior initially acquired it as a gesture to the Left, after the uprising at the funeral of Lamarque in June 1832 it was never again openly displayed for fear of setting a bad example.&lt;ref name="boime"&gt;{{cite book| first=Albert| last=Boime| title=Art in an Age of Civil Struggle, 1848–1871| publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]]| location=[[Chicago]]| date=1 February 2008| page=16| asin=B00866AX2K}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; Delacroix was permitted to send the painting to his aunt Félicité for safekeeping. It was exhibited briefly in 1848, after the Republic was restored in the revolution of that year, and then in the [[Salon (Paris)|Salon]] of 1855. In 1874, the painting entered the collection of [[Palais du Louvre]] in [[Paris]].

In 1974–75, the work was the featured work in an exhibit organized by the French government, the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in [[New York City|New York]] and the [[Detroit Institute of Arts]] as a [[United States Bicentennial|Bicentennial]] gift to the people of the United States. The exhibit, entitled ''French Painting 1774–1830: The Age of Revolution'', marked a rare display of the Delacroix painting, and many of the other 148 works, outside France.&lt;ref name="freep"&gt;{{cite news| title= At the Institute of Arts, A Heroic Show from France| work=[[Detroit Free Press]]| page=D1| date=2 March 1975| author=Marsha Miro}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The exhibit was first shown at the [[Grand Palais]] from 16 November 1974 to 3 February 1975. It moved to Detroit from 5 March to 4 May 1975, then New York from 12 June to 7 September 1975.&lt;ref name="wayne"&gt;{{cite book| title=French painting 1774–1830, the Age of Revolution| url=https://books.google.com/books/about/French_painting_1774_1830.html?id=BGbrAAAAMAAJ| author=Detroit Institute of Arts, Metropolitan Museum of Art| publisher=[[Wayne State University Press]]| location=[[Detroit]]| year=1975}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, it was flown on board an [[Airbus Beluga]] from [[Paris]] to [[Tokyo]] via [[Bahrain]] and [[Calcutta]] in about 20 hours. The large canvas, measuring {{convert|2.99|m|ft|abbr=off}} high by {{convert|3.62|m|ft|abbr=off}} long, was too large to fit into a Boeing 747. It was transported in the vertical position inside a special pressurised container provided with isothermal protection and an anti-vibration device.&lt;ref name="guppy"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.allaboutguppys.com/beluga/600stf.htm| title=Airbus A300-600ST Super Transporter| publisher=All About Guppys| accessdate=26 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, it was moved to the new [[Louvre-Lens]] museum in [[Lens, Pas-de-Calais]], as the starring work in the first tranche of paintings from the Louvre's collection to be installed.&lt;ref name="chrisafis"&gt;{{cite news| first=Angelique| last=Chrisafis| title=Louvre opens 'glass river' on Lens slagheap| newspaper=[[The Guardian]]| location=London| url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/dec/03/louvre-lens-art-france-mining| date=4 December 2012| accessdate=4 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 7 February 2013, the painting was vandalized by a visitor in Lens. An unidentified 28-year-old woman allegedly wrote an inscription [[Architects &amp; Engineers for 9/11 Truth|("AE911")]] on the painting.&lt;ref name="IND1"&gt;{{cite news |first=Mathilda |last=Battersby |title=Delacroix Liberty painting defaced by woman with marker pen at Louvre exhibition |work=The Independent |location=London |date=8 February 2013 |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/news/delacroix-liberty-painting-defaced-by-woman-with-marker-pen-at-louvre-exhibition-8487092.html |accessdate=8 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IND2"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/the-mystery-of-ae911-cryptic-code-scrawled-on-delacroixs-vandalised-masterpiece-8487847.html |title=The mystery of AE911 Cryptic code scrawled on Delacroix’s vandalised masterpiece |author=John Lichfield |date=8 February 2013 |publisher=[[The Independent]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The woman was immediately arrested by a [[security guard]] and a visitor. A short time after the incident, the management of the Louvre and its Pas-de-Calais branch published a press release indicating that "at first glance, the inscription is superficial and should be easily removed".&lt;ref name=NouvelObs&gt;{{cite news| language=French| url=http://tempsreel.nouvelobs.com/culture/20130207.OBS8227/la-liberte-guidant-le-peuple-de-delacroix-degradee-au-louvre-lens.html |title=La liberté guidant le peuple de Delacroix dégradée au Louvre-Lens |author=[[Agence France-Presse]] |work=[[Le Nouvel Observateur]]|date=7 February 2013  |accessdate=7 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="France3"&gt;{{cite news| language=French| url=http://nord-pas-de-calais.france3.fr/2013/02/07/louvre-lens-la-liberte-guidant-le-peuple-de-delacroix-ete-tague-l-encre-indelebile-196229.html |title=Louvre-Lens: "La liberté guidant le peuple" de Delacroix a été tagué à l'encre indélébile |first=Emmanuel |last=Magdeleine |work=[[France 3]] Nord Pas-de-Calais |date=7 February 2013 |accessdate=7 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Louvre officials announced the next day that the writing had been removed in less than two hours by a restorer without damaging the original paint, and the piece returned to display that morning.&lt;ref name="IND2"/&gt;

Although Delacroix was not the first artist to depict Liberty in Phrygian cap, his painting may be the best known early version of the figure commonly known as [[Marianne]], a symbol of the [[French Republic]] and of [[France]] in general.&lt;ref name=Marianne&gt;{{cite book| last=Warner| first=Marina| title=Monuments &amp; Maidens: The Allegory of the Female Form| year=2000| publisher=University of California Press| isbn=978-0520227330| pages=270–71| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KUrd5GqffyEC&amp;pg=PA270#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false| authorlink=Marina Warner}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting may have influenced Victor Hugo's novel ''[[Les Misérables]]''. In particular, the character of [[Gavroche]] is widely believed to have been inspired by the figure of the pistol-wielding boy running over the barricade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Mould| first=Michael| title=The Routledge Dictionary of Cultural References in Modern French| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x-FNTmUwfpEC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+Routledge+Dictionary+of+Cultural+References+in+Modern+French&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwib_v728YPcAhUOTawKHTx1DakQ6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=gavroche&amp;f=false| publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis| year=2011| page=112| isbn=978-1136825736}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Berg| first=William| title=Imagery and Ideology: Fiction and Painting in Nineteenth-Century France| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UgSQME4oblsC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Imagery+and+Ideology:+Fiction+and+Painting+in+Nineteenth-Century+France&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi9xpTe8oPcAhVS-qwKHXAYBPYQ6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=gavroche&amp;f=false| publisher=Associated University Presse| year=2007| page=106}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first=Gilles| last=Néret| title=Eugène Delacroix, 1798–1863: The Prince of Romanticism| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=510NakxgJ5EC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Eug%C3%A8ne+Delacroix,+1798%E2%80%931863:+The+Prince+of+Romanticism&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjBserj84PcAhVIgK0KHW4IDYgQ6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=liberty%20leading%20people&amp;f=false| publisher=Taschen| year=2000| page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pool, Phoebe (1969). Delacroix. London: Hamlyn, p.33&lt;/ref&gt; The novel describes the events of the [[June Rebellion]] two years after the revolution celebrated in the painting, the same rebellion that led to its being removed from public view.

The painting inspired [[Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi]]'s ''Liberty Enlightening the World'', known as the [[Statue of Liberty]] in [[New York City]],&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite AV media| url=http://cliponload.com/2010/09/25/bbc-the-private-life-of-a-masterpiece-part-3-masterpieces-1800-1850-2004/| series=The Private Life of a Masterpiece| title=Part 3, Liberty Leading the People| publisher=[[BBC]]| year=2005| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110106055432/http://cliponload.com/2010/09/25/bbc-the-private-life-of-a-masterpiece-part-3-masterpieces-1800-1850-2004/| archivedate=6 January 2011| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was given to the United States as a gift from the French a half-century after ''Liberty Leading the People'' was painted. The statue, which holds a torch in its hand, takes a more stable, immovable stance than that of the woman in the painting. An engraved version of part of the painting, along with a depiction of Delacroix, was featured on the 100 franc note from 1978 to 1995.

The painting has had an influence on classical music. [[George Antheil]] titled his Symphony No. 6 ''After Delacroix'', and stated that the work was inspired by ''Liberty Leading the People''.&lt;ref name="tuttle"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.classical.net/~music/recs/reviews/c/cpo99604a.php| title=George Antheil, Symphonies #1 &amp; 6.

During the 20 October 2011 episode of the [[BBC Radio 4]] series [[In Our Time (radio series)|In Our Time]], host [[Melvyn Bragg]] led a panel discussion of painting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode| title=Delacroix's Liberty Leading the People| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b015zrrj| series=In Our Time| air-date=20 October 2011| network=BBC Radio 4| accessdate=3 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
''Liberty Leading the People'' is considered to be a [[Republicanism|republican]] and [[Anti-monarchism|anti-monarchist]] symbol, and thus was sometimes criticized,&lt;ref name="mobile"&gt;{{cite book| author=MobileReference| title=Paris Sights: A Travel Guide to the Top 45 Attractions in Paris, France| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hK5s6hi9UMEC&amp;pg=PT276| year=2010| publisher=MobileReference| isbn=978-1-60778-976-5| page=276}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="petrey"&gt;{{cite book| first=Sandy| last=Petrey| title=In The Court Of The Pear King: French Culture And The Rise Of Realism| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dLN1ungp3ewC&amp;pg=PA101| year=2005| publisher=Cornell University Press|isbn=978-0-8014-4341-1| page=101}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first=John| last=O'Loughlin| title=Insane But Not Mad| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bkDdC33CaRoC&amp;pg=PT10|publisher=Centretruths Digital Media| date=January 27, 2013| isbn=978-1-4476-6376-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; especially by [[royalist]]s and [[monarchist]]s.

==Notes==
{{refbegin}}
'''A'''{{note label|Davis||1}}{{note label|Muni||2}}[[Bette Davis]]' performance in ''[[Of Human Bondage (1934 film)|Of Human Bondage]]'' (1934) and [[Paul Muni]]'s performance in ''[[Black Fury (film)|Black Fury]]'' (1935) were not nominated for Oscars. As a result of Davis's failure to get a nomination, several influential people campaigned to have her name included on the list, so for that year, and the following year also, the Academy allowed a write-in vote. Technically this meant that any performance was eligible. At the [[6th Academy Awards|6th]], [[7th Academy Awards|7th]] and [[8th Academy Awards]], the Academy publicly announced those that placed second and third in the vote. Davis placed third ahead of one official nominee and Muni placed second, ahead of three official nominees, and both Davis and Muni are listed on the Academy's official database as write-in nominees who placed in the final voting. From the [[9th Academy Awards]], the nominating committees were no longer used and the entire membership of each individual branch voted for the nominees in their respective categories.&lt;br&gt;
'''B'''{{note label|Olivier|1}}[[Laurence Olivier]] received a total of 13 Oscar nominations, winning two. In addition to his 10 acting nominations (one win), he received two [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] nominations; for producing 1944 film ''[[Henry V (1944 film)|Henry V]]'' (released in the US in 1946) and 1948 film ''[[Hamlet (1948 film)|Hamlet]]'' (for which he won), and received a [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] nomination for ''Hamlet''. Olivier also received two [[Honorary Oscar]]s; one for bringing ''Henry V'' to the screen, and a second in 1979 for Lifetime Achievement.&lt;br&gt;
'''C'''{{note label|Washington||1}}{{note label|MacLaine||2}}{{note label|DiCaprio||2}}{{note label|Cooper||3}}[[Denzel Washington]], [[Leonardo DiCaprio]], [[Shirley MacLaine]] and [[Bradley Cooper]] have all received an additional nomination in a non-acting category. MacLaine received an additional nomination in the [[Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature|Best Documentary Feature]] category as co-director of the 1975 documentary ''[[The Other Half of the Sky: A China Memoir]]''. Washington, DiCaprio and Cooper have received an additional nomination in the Best Picture category, Washington for co-producing ''[[Fences (film)|Fences]]'' (2016), DiCaprio for co-producing ''[[The Wolf of Wall Street (2013 film)|The Wolf of Wall Street]]'' (2013), and Cooper for co-producing ''[[American Sniper]]'' (2014)&lt;br&gt;
'''D'''{{note label|Shearer||1}}{{note label|Colman||2}}{{note label|Garbo||3}}Rules at the time of the first three Academy Award ceremonies allowed for a performer to receive a single nomination for their work in more than one film. At the [[1st Academy Awards|1st ceremony]], [[Emil Jannings]] won Best Actor for his work in two films and [[Janet Gaynor]] won Best Actress for her work in three films. [[Richard Barthelmess]] also received a nomination for two films at the 1st ceremony. At the [[3rd Academy Awards|3rd ceremony]], [[George Arliss]], [[Maurice Chevalier]], [[Ronald Colman]], [[Greta Garbo]] and [[Norma Shearer]] all received a single nomination for their work in two films. This is why the Academy lists Colman and Garbo as three-time nominees and Shearer as a five-time nominee. Barthelmess, Arliss and Chevalier are one-time nominees, so do not feature in the above lists. No official reason was ever given as to why Arliss and Shearer were named Best Actor and Best Actress for only one of the two films for which they were listed.&lt;br&gt;
'''E'''{{note label|Muni||1}}{{note label|Chatterton||2}}At the [[2nd Academy Awards]] only the Best Actor and Best Actress winners were announced. There was no announcement of nominations. The official Academy site states that "although not official nominations, the additional names in each category, according to in-house records, were under consideration by various boards of judges". Although unofficial, [[Ruth Chatterton]]'s nomination at the 2nd ceremony (the first of her two) counts towards her total in the above lists, and Paul Muni's nomination at the 2nd ceremony, counts as one of his five nominations in the above lists (his write-in vote from 1935 is not counted).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://awardsdatabase.oscars.org/ampas_awards/BasicSearchInput.jsp |publisher=Academy Awards |title=Academy Awards database |accessdate=17 September 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090208011732/http://awardsdatabase.oscars.org/ampas_awards/BasicSearchInput.jsp |archivedate=8 February 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;
'''F'''{{note label|Clooney||1}}{{note label|Thompson||2}}{{note label|Pitt||3}}{{note label|Damon||4}}[[George Clooney]], [[Emma Thompson]], [[Brad Pitt]] and [[Matt Damon]] have all won Oscars in non-acting categories. Clooney has eight Oscar nominations (four for acting, two for writing, one for directing and one for producing) with two wins. In addition to his win for Best Supporting Actor, he won Best Picture for co-producing ''[[Argo (2012 film)|Argo]]'' (2012). Thompson is a five-time nominee with two wins. In addition to her Best Actress win, she won the [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay]] for ''[[Sense and Sensibility (film)|Sense and Sensibility]]'' (1995). Pitt is a six-time Oscar nominee (three for acting, three for producing). He won an Oscar for co-producing Best Picture winner ''[[12 Years a Slave (film)|12 Years a Slave]]'' (2013). Damon is a five-time nominee (three for acting, one for writing and one for co-producing 2016 Best Picture nominee ''[[Manchester by the Sea (film)|Manchester by the Sea]]''), winning the [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay]] (shared with [[Ben Affleck]]) for ''[[Good Will Hunting]]'' (1997).&lt;br&gt;
'''G'''{{note label|Chaplin||1}}At the 1st Academy Award ceremony, [[Charlie Chaplin]] received four nominations (including Best Actor) for his film ''[[The Circus (film)|The Circus]]'', before the Academy decided to remove his name from the competitive categories and instead honor him with a special award. A letter sent by the Academy to Chaplin told him that they had "Unanimously decided that your name should be removed from the competitive classes, and that a special award be conferred upon you for writing, acting, directing and producing ''The Circus''. The collective accomplishments thus displayed place you in a class by yourself". Chaplin went on to receive nominations for Best Actor, Best Writing and Best Picture (the latter credited to Charlie Chaplin Productions) for the 1940 film ''[[The Great Dictator]]'' and a Best Writing nomination for the 1947 film ''[[Monsieur Verdoux]]''. He received a second Honorary Oscar at the [[44th Academy Awards]] in 1972, before winning his first competitive Oscar at the [[45th Academy Awards]] in 1973 for [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Dramatic Score]] for his 1952 film ''[[Limelight (1952 film)|Limelight]]'', which was eligible for that years Oscars because it was not released in Los Angeles until 1972.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/race/academy-disqualifies-oscar-nominated-song-675480| work=The Hollywood Reporter |title=Academy disqualifies Oscar nominated song |accessdate=6 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Multiverse''', within [[DC Comics]] publications, is a "cosmic construct" collecting many of the fictional universes in which the published stories take place. The worlds in this multiverse share a space and fate in common, and its structure has changed several times in the history of DC Comics.&lt;ref name="dc-ency"&gt;{{Cite book | last=Wallace | first=Dan | contribution=Alternate Earths | editor-last=Dougall | editor-first=Alastair | title=The DC Comics Encyclopedia | pages=20–21 | publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]] | location=[[London]] | date=2008 | isbn=0-7566-4119-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
=== Golden Age ===
The concept of a universe and a multiverse in which the fictional stories take place was loosely established during the Golden Age. With the publication of ''[[All-Star Comics]]'' #3 in 1940, the first crossover between characters occurred with the creation of the [[Justice Society of America]] (JSA), which presented the first superhero team with characters appearing in other publications (comic strips and anthology titles) to bring attention to less-known characters. This established the first shared "universe", as all these heroes now lived in the same world. Prior to this publication, characters from the different comic books seemingly existed in different worlds.

Later, ''Wonder Woman'' #59 (May 1953) presented DC Comics's first story depicting a parallel "mirror" world. [[Wonder Woman]] is transported to a twin Earth where she meets Tara Terruna who is exactly like her. Tara Terruna means "Wonder Woman" in the native language of that world. Wonder Woman describes this world as being a twin world existing alongside Earth with duplicates of everyone but with a different development. The concept of different versions of the world and its heroes was revisited in the pages of ''Wonder Woman'' a few times later.

=== Silver Age ===
Led by editor Julius Schwartz and writer Gardner Fox, DC Comics's super heroes were given a "reboot" with the publication of ''Showcase'' #4 in 1956, where a new version of the [[Flash (comics)|Flash]] made his first appearance. The success of this new Flash led the creation of new incarnations of the Golden Age characters who only shared the names and powers but had different secret identities, origins and stories. Later, new versions of other heroes, [[Superman]], [[Batman]] and Wonder Woman, were also restarted by retelling their origins but keeping their secret identities.
Gardner Fox, who worked before in the creation of the JSA, where other heroes met for the first time, created the story "[[Flash of Two Worlds]]" in ''The Flash'' #123, where Barry Allen, the new Flash, is transported to the Earth where the original Flash, Jay Garrick, existed. To Allen, Jay Garrick's world was a work of fiction as it was in the real world. This story not only presented the encounter of two worlds and the existence of the Multiverse for the first time, it also presented key features of the Multiverse: all the universes vibrate at a specific frequency which keeps them separated; these "barriers" could be trespassed by "tuning" to that vibration. Because people could also "tune-in" these worlds in dreams, some people wrote comic books with the stories from those worlds they dreamed, which explained why Barry Allen knew about Jay Garrick as a fictional character.

The success of this story led to the first team crossover between the new [[Justice League of America]] (JLA) and the Golden Age JSA, in the stories '''"Crisis on Earth-One"''' (''Justice League of America'' #21) and '''"Crisis on Earth-Two"''' (''Justice League of America'' #22). This story arc started the tradition of a yearly crossover between the JLA and the JSA, and established firmly the concept of a Multiverse and the designation of names, Earth-One being the JLA reality and Earth-Two the JSA reality. The success of these crossovers spawned publications telling the further stories of the Golden Age heroes in the present day parting from many of the stories told, thus, establishing a more defined continuity for every Universe.

This concept of parallel Earths with differences in locations, persons and historical events became a very important ingredient within DC Comics' publications. It helped (among other things) to explain continuity errors, to retell and [[Retroactive continuity|retcon]] stories, and to incorporate foreign elements that could actively interact with everything else and allow them to have an "existence". Continuity flaws between the established Earth-Two and several stories from the Golden Age were given separate Earths. "Imaginary" stories and some time divergences of Earth-One were given also separate realities (such as Earth-B and Earth-A). In addition to the stories appearing mainly in the pages of ''JLA'' that created new Earths, the acquisition of other comic book companies and characters by DC Comics incorporated these new properties as Earths in the Multiverse which would interact several times with the "main" Earths, One and Two; two of the most notable being Earth-S for the [[Fawcett Comics]] characters, and Earth-X for the Quality Comics characters. By the 1970s, everything that was published or related officially to DC Comics' titles could become part of the Multiverse, although much of it remained largely uncatalogued.

The names of the worlds were usually in the format ''Earth, hyphen, spelled numeral/letter/name''. In the case of worlds with numerals, the "rule" of spelling the number was not always followed, even within the pages of the same issue.

=== ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'' ===
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2016}}
As the 50th anniversary of DC Comics drew near, major events were proposed for the celebration: an encyclopedia (''[[Who's Who in the DC Universe]]'') and a crossover of the ages, characters, and worlds appearing in DC's comics. As told in the letter section of ''[[Crisis On Infinite Earths]]'' #1, as the research started in the late 1970s, it became evident that there were many flaws in continuity. The way used to circumvent some of these errors was the "Multiple Earths", which also showed a chaotic nature that brought even more continuity problems that were not easily explained or were simply left unexplained. Examples of this included: 1) Black Canary of Earth-One being the daughter of the original Black Canary of WWII even though the original Black Canary was a resident of Earth-Two, and 2) the existence of Golden Age comic books on Earth-One and the people not noticing that some of the characters in those comic books existed in "real-life". In addition, many universes had multiple alternate timelines, such as Kamandi and the Legion of Super-Heroes, both being from Earth-One.

Writer [[Marv Wolfman]] took this crossover event as an opportunity to reform all the fictional universe of DC Comics to avoid further continuity errors and update the DC characters to modern times. The whole Multiverse is destroyed except for five Earths (Silver Age Earth-One, Golden Age Earth-Two, Charlton Comics' Earth-Four, Fawcett Comics' Earth-S and Quality Comics' Freedom Fighters' Earth-X). Later, the universe is recreated as one single universe from those five.

The ''[[Convergence (comics)|Convergence]]'' (2015) crossover event officially retconned the events of ''Crisis'' after heroes in that series went back in time to prevent the collapse of the Multiverse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsarama.com/24643-major-spoilers-dc-s-convergence-concludes-undoes-crisis.html|title=MAJOR SPOILERS: DC's CONVERGENCE Concludes, Undoes [Redacted]|author=|date=|website=newsarama.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Modern Age ===

==== DC Comics ====
After the conclusion of ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'', the concept of a single Universe containing most elements of the "surviving Earths" was established and heavily enforced to avoid the continuity problems of the Multiverse. However, alternate realities that affected the new DC Universe appeared very quickly. In ''Superman'' Vol. 2 #8, a Universe inside the Universe was revealed to have been created to preserve the Legion of Super Heroes' 30th century in New Earth. This world was used to allow [[crossover (comics)|crossovers]] with certain characters of the [[Legion of Super-Heroes]] and recreate characters that otherwise could not exist in the new continuity (such as [[Kryptonian]]s, as in the New Earth [[Superman]] was the only survivor of Krypton). Alternate timelines were also used, the most notable event being ''[[Armageddon 2001]]'' in 1991. An [[Antimatter]] Universe existed as well, which had some "reversed" events in a similar way as the former Earth-Three. The Earth within this Universe was called "Earth 2". In addition, there was a Limbo, where some heroes and characters that could not be brought back to "existence" after the Crisis on Infinite Earths lived outside the Universe.

An important rule in the new DC Universe was that there could only be one timeline, so any change caused by time travelers caused the destruction of their timelines of origin. Changes in the past were often "fixed" or have to comply with the present to prevent continuity errors.

Nonetheless, continuity errors appeared. The retold origin of [[Hawkman]] presented errors regarding the existence of the Golden Age version ([[Hawkman (Carter Hall)|Carter Hall]]) and the Silver Age version ([[Katar Hol]]) in the same continuity without a good explanation. The interaction of "possible timelines" also created continuity holes. This led to a new crisis to address the problem: the [[Zero Hour: Crisis in Time|Zero Hour]]. The resulting universe had a slightly re-written story with no continuity errors even though it was acknowledged that reality-shattering events did happen (including the Crisis on Infinite Earths). This Universe kept the concept of one universe, one timeline. Such timeline was "mapped" from beginning to present (1994) at the back cover of ''Zero Hour'' #0, that also included certain key dates in the future.

The need to publish stories outside the strict DC Universe continuity led to the creation of certain DC [[Imprint (trade name)|imprints]]. Stories that set DC characters in different situations after the Crisis on Infinite Earths, were published by DC Comics under the '''[[Elseworlds]]''' imprint. None of these stories were ever intended to be included in the "real" continuity of the DC Universe.

Certain characters were reinvented in a mature context and were published under the '''[[Vertigo (DC Comics)|Vertigo]]''' imprint. Most of the times, the characters depicted within the Vertigo imprint had no relation to the original DC Universe's versions, nor did the events have influence over the new Universe.

Later, under a special publishing deal with [[Milestone Media]], DC Comics published a new series of comic books that told the stories of the heroes living in [[Dakota City (comics)|Dakota City]], formed mostly by African-American superheroes and other minorities. These characters lived in a universe separated from the DC Universe (known as the Dakotaverse or Milestone Universe). The event known as  ''[[Worlds Collide (comics)|Worlds Collide]]'' presented one of the first modern intercompany crossovers within the established continuity of the Universes instead of being "imaginary" and showed that there could be other universes or even multiverses outside the new DC Universe.

In a similar way to ''[[Worlds Collide (comics)|Worlds Collide]]'', the crossover event ''[[DC vs. Marvel]]'' showed another in-continuity crossover with another reality completely separated from the DC Universe and that has a Multiverse of its own: the universe of Earth-616 of the Marvel Multiverse.

The universes were rarely referred to with specific names within the stories but were named in the "Real World" (both officially and unofficially) using the name of the editorial, imprint or even an element in particular. While in the comic books the concept of a "real" Multiverse was avoided, the Multiverse played an important role in cartoon series and live-action shows (see [[Multiverse (DC Comics)#Other versions|Other versions]]).

In summary, from 1986 to 1999, everything not happening in the "mainstream" continuity appearing in DC comics was either an "apocryphal" story or happened in a completely different and separate reality/universe/multiverse.

In 1999, the unexpected and overwhelming success of Elseworlds's ''[[Kingdom Come (comics)|Kingdom Come]]'' and other stories, led to the creation of the concept known as [[Hypertime]] in order to publish crossovers with those characters and the mainstream continuity. This structure gave "existence" to alternate timelines, stories in Elseworlds, appearances in other media and any other appearance of DC characters in the past. The main timeline or "Central Timeline" was like a river and all of the alternate stories were branches of it. Hypertime was similar to the former Multiverse as it allowed each and every reality ever published to co-exist and interact as most branches tend to return to the original stream (explaining some retcons as well as crossovers). However, all realities existed within only one Universe.

==== WildStorm ====
Originally, the stories appearing in WildStorm Productions' comic books occurred in a Universe that was part of the [[Image Comics|Image Universe]] along with other characters appearing in Image Comics publications. It was separated from it during the event called '''''Shattered Image''''' consolidating the separate WildStorm Universe which had its own multiversal structure. After the purchase of WildStorm by DC Comics, crossovers occurred with the new DC Universe, which were still separated just like Milestone and Marvel.

=== 21st century ===

==== ''52'' ====
{{Main|52 (comics)}}

In 2005, a new universal crisis story arc was published as a way to update once more the super heroes of DC Comics, bring together other "realities" (namely, Milestone and Wildstorm) and bring back the Multiverse, this time with a limited number of Earths instead of infinite.

During the event ''Infinite Crisis'', the Universe was "splintered" and the original Multiverse was restored briefly, showing that the entire Hypertime and many other appearances of the DC characters were part of the original Multiverse, including [[Tangent Comics]] which were published 12 years after the Multiverse was no more. In the end of ''Infinite Crisis'', the multiverse is merged back as a New Earth with a new continuity with many stories re-written and many others from the Modern Age still happening.

In parallel, ''Captain Atom: Armageddon'' tells the story of how Captain Atom of the DC Universe causes the recreation of the Wildstorm Universe upon its destruction (and possibly its Multiverse as well). The recreated universe became part of the newly recreated DC Universe.

The aftermath of ''Infinite Crisis'' and ''Captain Atom: Armageddon'' (''52'', ''Countdown to Final Crisis'' and ''Final Crisis'') showed that a new Multiverse was created. The new Multiverse consisted of 52 positive matter universes, an Antimatter Universe and a Limbo. The main continuity still occurred in New Earth (also called Earth-0), Earths 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 10 resembled Earths One, Two, Three, Four, S, and X of the original Multiverse respectively. Earths 13 and 50 were Vertigo and the rebooted Wildstorm Universe, while Earth-17 became the world of a revived [[post-apocalypse]] [[Atomic Knights]] after a mid-80s [[World War III]] once more. Many important stories from the Elseworlds imprint were later also given their own alternate Earths within this new Multiverse.

In the miniseries, ''Milestone Forever'', in a similar fashion as ''Captain Atom: Armageddon'', the events that led to the end of the Dakotaverse and its integration to the new DC continuity are revealed. Most of the stories that were told in Milestone Comics publications now occurred in New Earth and the Dakotaverse ceased to exist as a separated Universe.

A naming convention was established and followed this time in the format ''Earth, hyphen, numeral'', from Earth-0 to Earth-51.

Even with a new Multiverse, not every published or related work had an "Earth" within the 52 and there were no in-continuity intercompany crossovers.

Taking advantage of the fact that many of these universes were mostly unchronicled or merely glimpsed and that ''Final Crisis'' also changed the Multiverse slightly, many stories featuring alternate worlds and their interactions were published, which led certain inconsistencies and retcons to appear, such as Earth-1 being originally a "mirror" of Earth-One and later being the reality of [[J. Michael Straczynski]]'s ''[[Superman: Earth One]]'' or Earth-16 being the home of an alternate Superman/[[Chris Kent (comics)|Christopher Kent]], the home of the ''[[Super-Sons]]'', and later the reality of the ''[[Young Justice (TV series)|Young Justice]]'' TV series. Also, some universes appearing in the new continuity were never given a proper place within the 52 Universe, such as Prime-Earth.

==== ''The New 52'' ====
{{Main|The New 52}}

The new restored universe with only 52 worlds opened myriad possibilities for new stories and crossovers with different versions of heroes interacting with the main versions of heroes as well as the stories resulting from the new integrated characters from Milestone and Wildstorm. However, it became chaotic in just five years. Many stories and situations of other Universes were not followed well. The number designations could be completely disregarded from story to story and some universes were recreated over and over. In addition, as most of the history of the Modern Age was still being the main continuity, younger readers could not follow the stories of the mainstream versions of the DC heroes, just as had happened prior to the original ''Crisis on Infinite Earths''.

In order to overcome these new problems, a new event was created to restart the DC Comics's Universe. In the ''[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]'' miniseries (May–September 2011), the Flash alters the timeline of Earth-0 creating a ripple effect that affected several past events, Earth-13 (Vertigo Universe) and Earth-50 (new Wildstorm Universe).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ifanboy.com/articles/features/the-definitive-guide-to-the-dc-comics-reboot/|title=The Definitive Guide To The DC Comics Reboot|author=|date=|website=ifanboy.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar to the end result of ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'', a new mainstream Earth is created from the former three, with a whole new history.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comicsalliance.com/2011/08/31/faq-dc-comics-new-52 The New 52 FAQ: Answering Your Questions about the Relaunched DC Universe] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120126043701/http://www.comicsalliance.com/2011/08/31/faq-dc-comics-new-52 |date=2012-01-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the stories have been retold anew but certain events of New Earth remain (such as Batgirl being crippled by the Joker). Since it was established after ''Infinite Crisis'' that if something ever happened to the main Universe, the whole Multiverse could be affected as well, a new Multiverse of 52 worlds was also recreated. This new Multiverse is called ''The New 52''.

This time, not all universes were revealed right away, only a couple were revealed in the first two years of ''The New 52''. In addition, in a similar fashion as the Elseworlds logo would appear in comics that did not occur in the "real" continuity, the logo ''THE NEW 52!'' would only appear in publications with stories occurring in the new continuity, while those taking place outside of this new continuity (such as ''Smallville: Season 11'' or the ''Batman Beyond'' universe) would not bear this distinction. At first it seemed that there was not going to be a naming convention for the Earths as it happened with the 52. The mainstream continuity was known as Prime Earth, although it was not a similar world to the real world as Earth-Prime was. [[J. Michael Straczynski]]'s re-envisioning of classic Batman and Superman stories was released as part of a series called ''Earth One''. In Grant Morrison's ''[[The Multiversity]]'' (2014–2015), the Earths are named in the same format as in the former 52 Multiverse (Earth-6, Earth-7, Earth-8 etc.) Morrison intended for ''[[The Multiversity]]'' to reveal remaining universes of The New 52 multiverse, and the underlying structure for the multiverse was revealed in a detailed map in the back of several comic books, for which an interactive online version is being maintained and updated on the DC Comics website. In addition, the sixth issue of ''The Multiversity'' constituted a 'guidebook' to the worlds of the current DC multiverse and was published in January 2015.&lt;ref&gt;''Multiversity Guidebook'' (January 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

==== ''Convergence'' and ''DC Rebirth'' ====
{{Main|Convergence (comics)}}

On October 2, 2011, Dan DiDio posted on his Facebook page that in The New 52, the three previous "crises" did not occur in this new continuity, but other events such as ''Zero Hour'' still happened, without ending in a crisis/reboot.&lt;ref&gt;Lichman, John (October 4, 2011) [http://www.ugo.com/the-goods/dc-new-52-timeline-so-far.html "DC New 52 Timeline So Far"]. UGO.&lt;/ref&gt; However, writers continued to make references to the crises, and the full history of the structure of the DC Multiverse, detailing previous crisis events, was given in [[Grant Morrison]]'s ''[[The Multiversity]]'' (2014–2015) limited series.

The ''Convergence'' (2015) crossover event later explored this concept within the DCU. This miniseries brought back several heroes from the ages of DC Comics that were obliterated by the crisis events. They were trapped by a godlike incarnation of [[Brainiac (character)|Brainiac]] outside of time (or Vanishing Point as this "place" is called). At the end of the crossover, Brainiac sent these heroes back to their own timelines, and also successfully sent ''Zero Hour'' Hal Jordan, pre-''Flashpoint'' Superman and other heroes back to the events of ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'' so that the collapse of the Multiverse could be averted.

From July 2015 onwards, The New 52 marking ended with the continuation of several publications and new others that did not necessarily take place within ''The New 52'' multiverse. Advertised as ''DC YOU'' (a pun of DCU or DC Universe and the phrase "it's about you, the fans" appearing in the advertisements), DC now has an "open doors" policy to continuity, granting writers greater freedom to explore stories set outside the established New 52 Multiverse continuity, as well as to revisit other characters and concepts from DC's history as the conclusion of ''Convergence'' suggested that although the core 52 universe that now exists is the evolution of the multiverse, all the worlds still exist in some form. This was confirmed by ''Convergence'' writer Jeff King, as he stated that the reconstituted DC Multiverse is now infinite and there might be more than one Multiverse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://comicbook.com/2015/05/27/decoding-convergence-with-jeff-king-the-finale/|title=Decoding Convergence With Jeff King: The Finale|author=|date=|website=comicbook.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2016 ''[[DC Rebirth]]'' initiative returned the original Wally West to Earth from the Speed Force and reveals that time has been stolen from his friends' memories, and the Superman of the pre-''Flashpoint'' world, stranded in the new timeline following ''Convergence'', assumes the role of that Earth's Superman. In ''Action Comics'' #976, the pre-''Flashpoint'' and ''New 52'' Supermen's histories are merged. [[Peter J. Tomasi]] explains that "The events of ''Action'' #976 reset and reshape the entire Superman timeline. Where there had been two Superman, their realities have now been fused into one timeline with just one of them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://comicsalliance.com/superman-reborn-recap/|title=Everything Changed Forever!

== Fictional history, structure and worlds of the DC Multiverse ==
{{See also|List of DC Multiverse worlds}}

=== Infinite Multiverse ===
As told in ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'' #7, the DC Universe was a single positive matter Universe until a scientist named Krona from the planet Oa altered the very moment of the creation of the Universe, causing it to split into countless similar universes and an antimatter universe. Oa, however, had no duplicates in the Multiverse but did have a twin in the antimatter universe: Qward. A satellite on each of these planets was created in the cataclysm and it was there where the embodiments of the Multiverse were born: the Monitor and the [[Anti-Monitor]]. The two battled to a standstill and eventually rendered one another comatose.

The Multiverse had countless&lt;ref&gt;Marv Wolfman, the writer of ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'', estimated that the original Multiverse had consisted of about 3,000 universes.&lt;/ref&gt; duplicates of planet Earth. Every Earth had a different history from one another but they always developed heroes and inspired heroic ages (which, according to Harbinger, it somehow made them a focal point among all the worlds in every universe). Some of the heroes of Earth knew about other Earths and their own counterparts and fought side by side on many occasions.

Later, a scientist from one universe named Kell Mossa (known initially only as [[Pariah (comics)|Pariah]]) created another device that would allow him to attempt the same thing Krona had attempted before. His actions accidentally awakened the Anti-Monitor, who then devoured Pariah's entire universe (aside from Pariah himself) and began to do the same to other universes (Pariah originally believes that the opposite is true; that his experiment destroyed the universes, which awakened the Anti-Monitor, until the truth is revealed to him). The time period of Earth when this takes place or the name of this Earth are never revealed.

The Monitor is awakened by the destruction of the positive matter universes and starts a plan to save the Multiverse but his efforts, and later those of his protégé, Harbinger, with the help of the heroes of the Multiverse, only manage to save five universes. In a desperate effort to save all existence, heroes and villains unite in order to stop Krona from splitting the Universe and stop the Anti-Monitor from altering the moment of creation and make the Antimatter Universe the only one. They succeed in saving all existence but in the process, the Multiverse, its countless duplicate worlds and its history ceased to exist. The five universes that were saved were folded together into a single universe, placing all the heroes and villains into a single timeline. For example, Justice Society of Earth-Two instead became a team active in the 1940s that inspired the Justice League to form decades later. And in the event of any duplicate characters, the original Earth-One version would take precedence.

All the universes existed within the same space but had a unique vibration that kept them separated. Only by "tuning" to the specific frequency of a universe could a person leap to another Earth, as Barry Allen discovered as he tried to perform a disappearing act by vibrating his molecules at super speed (''Flash'' #123). The "speedster" later developed a machine called the "Cosmic Treadmill", which, when it was used by people who controlled the [[Speed Force]], it allowed the users to trespass the "vibrational barriers". Magic and cosmic incidents also made many people to travel to other universes.

Every universe could have its own dimensions, such as the Fifth Dimension (where Mr. Mxyztplk (Earth-Two), Mr. Mxyzptlk and Bat-Mite (both Earth-One) came from), alternate timelines (Kamandi and the 30th Century of Earth-One) and realms (Hell, Heaven, Gemworld, etc.). In addition to the unique Antimatter Universe, the dimension of the New Gods (the Fourth World) was also believed unique, although there is evidence that there could have been alternate versions of them (as those appearing in Earth-17 and Earth-Crossover).

Even though the interaction between multiple Earths was common in the 20th century with relative safety and ease, most of the population of Earth was unaware of the Multiverse until the Crisis on Infinite Earths.

The following is a short list of the most notable universes in the Multiverse.

15 billion years ago, a single universe with a single timestream was created. 4.4 billion years ago, Krona, the renegade Maltusian (a race of highly evolved beings) creates the Antimatter Universe and releases entropy in the universe by linking the beginning and the end of the timeline in his attempts to reveal the secrets of the creation of the universe.

In this single universe, the timeline was destroyed in the early 1990s by Hal Jordan (possessed by Parallax) and created a slightly changed timeline (''Zero Hour'', 1994). It was later revealed that this ''Central Timeline'' was like a river with branches. These branches were like different realities, the history of Earth was different in every branch and everything could be possible in them. They could affect the Central Timeline as they return to the mainstream and the heroes could encounter with different versions of themselves. However, they were somewhat ephemeral as the Central Timeline is the only one that could prevail (''The Kingdom'', 1999).

After ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'', there was no place for alternate realities, although they could exist in the form of ephemeral timelines (Hypertime), dimensions (such as the fifth dimension or the Fourth World) or universes inside the Universe (such as the Legion of Super-Heroes' pocket universe or the Amalgam Universe).

However, there was contact with realities that existed outside the Universe such as those from Marvel, Milestone and Wildstorm. The collection of universes, multiverses and others that are unrelated, is most of the time called the Megaverse. Some{{Who|date=October 2015}} also call it the Omniverse, but tend to include the Real World when using this denomination.

The contact of these worlds usually brought cataclysms, the one being the most common, amalgamation. Traveling between these realities was extremely hard, only two characters were capable of doing so with natural abilities: Rift, who existed in both the DC and Milestone Universes, and Access, who had the task of keeping the DC and Marvel Universes separated to prevent amalgamation.

Most of the time, these events were either forgotten (as shown in the ''Unlimited Access'' miniseries as Access has the power to annul or restore the memories of heroes) or believed to be "dreams" (as shown in ''DC/Milestone: Worlds Collide'' and ''DC/Wildstorm: Dreamwar''), which in the end left few traces of the events in the respective continuities.

The Wildstorm Universe was part of a larger multiverse but was separated after a multiversal cataclysm, forming a multiverse of its own (''Shattered Image''). Organizations known as [[Planetary (comics)|Planetary]] and the Authority were capable of traveling across the Multiverse and were also able to map it. Its structure was described as a web of 196,833 universes arranged in a pattern resembling a [[snowflake]], each universe separated from its neighbors by a medium called the [[Bleed (comics)|Bleed]]. The Bleed prevented the Universes from colliding and was inhabited by "fauna" that despised all different Earths.

=== ''52'' ===
Alexander Luthor Jr. of Earth-Three and Superboy of Earth-Prime grew tired of their exile. After successfully escaping their prison, they seek to restore their worlds and search for a perfect new world, as they believe the happenings at New Earth after the Crisis make it a flawed reality. The whole Multiverse is restored, but with great instability that could cause the end of all existence (''Infinite Crisis''). Parallel to these events, Captain Atom arrives in a different multiverse, jeopardizing its very existence. Void destroys the now-corrupted universe in order to recreate it (''Captain Atom: Armageddon'').

The heroes of Earth manage to merge back the Multiverse into a single universe, but it could not hold so much energy. 52 identical worlds are created to liberate such energy. Mister Mind, finally in his ultimate form, has the power to devour parts of the time continuum, literally eating parts of the Earths' history and creating major differences between each other (''[[52 (comics)|52]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070504180243/http://www.wizarduniverse.com/magazine/wizard/004448945.cfm|title=Wizard Entertainment|author=|date=4 May 2007|website=archive.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;).&lt;ref name="countdownarena"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=124768 |title=WW: Chicago '07: Dan DiDio on 'Countdown: Arena' |work=[[Newsarama]] |accessdate=February 4, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011131246/http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=124768 |archivedate=October 11, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Universe where the city of Dakota existed, a man known as Dharma foresaw the final demise of Earth and searched for a way to avert it. His very efforts were responsible for the apocalypse he tried to prevent. He managed to salvage the remains of his Earth by merging them to the main Earth of the new Multiverse that was reformed after the death of the New Gods (''Milestone Forever'', ''Final Crisis'').

This Multiverse consisted of only 52 worlds, 51 resting upon Earth-0. According to Rip Hunter in ''52 #52'', every universe occupied the same space, each on a different vibrational plane (as it was in the original Multiverse). However, it was stated later that the universes were also separated by a fluid known as the Bleed (just like in the former Wildstorm Universe). The Bleed is interconnected to the Source Wall (which separates existence from the force that created it or "the Source") and the Multiversal Nexus, where the 52 Monitors watched over the Multiverse and had the task of avoiding contacts between the universes that could cause cataclysms. If Earth-0 should be destroyed, it would cause a chain reaction, destroying the rest of the 51 universes and leaving the opposite Antimatter Universe solely in existence. Each of the alternate universes have their own parallel dimensions, divergent timelines, microverses, etc., branching off them.&lt;ref name="Baltimore"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=128569 |title=Baltimore Comic-Con '07: DC Nation Panel Report |work=Newsarama |accessdate=February 4, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070911033901/http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=128569 |archivedate=September 11, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Monitors originated in a world called Nil and were a sort of descendants of the original Monitor, who was created by Overvoid, a limitless intelligence who investigated the Multiverse at the beginning of time. Nix Uotan, the Monitor of Earth-51 erased the Monitors, as they self-proclaimed themselves the judges of what happened in the worlds of the Multiverse.

=== ''The New 52'' ===
The Flash wakes up in an altered timeline. As he tries to find the cause, he discovers that he was responsible for the alteration and attempts to fix it. In doing so, it is revealed that the timelines of Earth-0, Earth-13 and Earth-50 were originally one, but were splintered. The result is a new timeline formed by those three and along with it came a new history for the other 52 worlds within the Multiverse (''Flashpoint'', 2011). It is later revealed that, in actuality, the current timeline was created when a mysterious being (implied to be Doctor Manhattan from ''Watchmen'') entered the Multiverse while the timeline was resetting due to Barry Allen preventing the Flashpoint event and extracted ten years from continuity (''DC Universe: Rebirth'', 2016)

Years later, the Harbinger Program at the House of Heroes gathers several superheroes of the "Orrery of Worlds" to fight against a force known as the "Gentry" who has already decimated Earth-7 and threatens the rest of the worlds of the Multiverse. As the story unfolds, Earths within the Orrery are visited and reveal the new nature of them after the Flashpoint event. Also, mysterious comic books published by DC and Major Comics appear and are believed to be cursed or to be messages from parallel Earths (''[[The Multiversity]]'' (2014)).

Several stories and even the structure of the entire Multiverse have been retold after the events of ''Flashpoint''. As it has been revealed so far, most of the 52 worlds suffered drastic changes such as Earth-2 which is now a reboot in the present day of the heroes that formed the Justice Society or Earth-3 which reverted to be the opposite of the main Earth (Earth-0 in this case), instead of the opposite of Earth-Two. Others retain most of what they were in the 52 multiverse such as Earth-5, Earth-10, or Earth-23. In addition, seven Earths remain undisclosed in composition or purpose, other than their creation by the Monitors for unknown reasons-Earths 14, 24, 25, 27, 28, 46 and 49.

The Monitors are now described as a race of countless members and only 52 remained after the ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'' event, suggesting that there were Monitors for every world in the original Multiverse instead of just one. Several elements that have appeared across the history to what now is DC Comics have also been actively incorporated in the new structure, such as the Source Wall (''The New Gods''), the Bleed (Wildstorm's ''The Authority''), the Speed Force and the vibrational barriers (''The Flash'') and the Rock of Eternity (''Shazam!'').

This new Multiverse has a sphere-like structure with several levels (or vibrational realms) as described in the map''':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://media.dcentertainment.com/sites/default/files/Multiversity_Map_2400_53ee6b4c22d9a9.11031355.jpg |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-02-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150612031510/http://media.dcentertainment.com/sites/default/files/Multiversity_Map_2400_53ee6b4c22d9a9.11031355.jpg |archivedate=2015-06-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''The Source Wall''': the limit of existence, beyond lies the ''Source'' and the ''Unknowable''. The ''Overvoid'' is shown in the map to exist outside it as well.
*'''The Monitor Sphere''': the origin of the ''Monitors'', a race who preserves and studies the universes.
*'''Limbo''': "where matter and memory break down"; the place where the lost and forgotten go.
*'''The Sphere of the Gods''': within it, the realms of old and new gods, demons and even dreams exist.
*'''The Speed Force Wall''': also known as the Speed of Light and is the limit to matter. Within it is the Orrery of Worlds and certain worlds exist in it (such as KRAKKL the Defender's world).
*'''The Orrery of Worlds''': the realm where the 52 universes exist in the same space, vibrating at different frequencies, within the ''Bleed''. In the center of it are the ''Rock of Eternity'' and the ''House of Heroes''.

=== Multi-Multiverse ===
An infinitely powerful and god-like version of [[Brainiac (character)|Brainiac]] abducted multiple superheroes and their core cities from various alternate Earths and eras of the Multiverse and pitted them against one another. Because of the heroes' efforts for the survival of reality during this event, the events of ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'' and ''Zero Hour'' were averted and there is once more an infinite Multiverse beyond the core 52 universes which have made up the local Multiverse since ''Infinite Crisis'' and ''Flashpoint''. The original Multiverse coexists along with the collapsed Earth, the core 52 worlds, and all other versions of the Multiverse that have ever existed.&lt;ref&gt;''Convergence'' #8 (May 2015): DC Comics: New York&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dark Multiverse ===
In the ''[[Dark Nights: Metal]]'' storyline, it is revealed that each reality of the Multiverse has a negative counterpart created by the fears of a universe's people. These Dark Universes are explained to be temporary realities, which motivate the Dark Knights to invade the Multiverse so that they can save their dying realities. Forthcoming "Dark Multiverse" stories will revisit this realm, with mutated versions of [[Superman]], [[Jimmy Olsen]] and [[Lois Lane]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.criticalhit.net/comics-toys/dc-just-getting-started-dark-multiverse-nightmarish-silver-age-designs-revealed-sideways/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other versions ==

=== ''Super Friends'' ===
{{Main|Super Friends}}

In the animated television series ''Super Friends'', the superhero team has encounters with other universes, including the world of Qward. In the episode "Universe of Evil", a freak accident causes [[Superman]] to switch places with his evil counterpart.

=== DC animated universe ===
{{Main|DC animated universe}}
The DC animated universe (DCAU) has depicted the Multiverse many times. Several characters from the main DCAU have visited parallel universes that were similar to the DCAU.

* In the ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]'' episode "Brave New Metropolis", [[Lois Lane]] fell into a parallel Earth where she had died in the car bombing orchestrated by Intergang. As a result, Superman had nothing to keep his morality from becoming corrupted. A much more serious Superman teamed with [[Lex Luthor]] and took over [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]], turning it into a fascist police-state where the Daily Planet and S.T.A.R. Labs were shut down and a rebellion, which Jimmy Olsen is a part of, was started, though Superman was unaware of what Lex Luthor was doing with Metropolis until Lois showed him the truth, which was enough for Superman to turn against Luthor.
* In the ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'' episode "Legends", several members of the League were accidentally sent to a parallel universe where [[John Stewart (comics)|John Stewart]]'s comic book idols, a [[pastiche]] of the [[Justice Society of America]] named the [[Justice Guild of America]], live. Justice Guild member Tom Turbine hypothesized that there are an infinite number of parallel dimensions.
* In the ''Justice League'' episode "A Better World", the Justice League were held captive by their authoritarian counterparts from another universe, the "[[Justice Lords]]". In this universe, Lex Luthor had risen to the U.S. Presidency and had started a war which had killed the Flash, sparking the Lords' takeover of the world, starting with this Superman killing President Luthor. In this world, the Justice Lords labotomized their former enemies, leaving them as harmless workers at Arkham. Later in the series, the regular Lex Luthor ran for President solely to enrage Superman for his amusement.
* In the ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' episode "Question Authority", the [[Question (comics)|Question]] is surfing through [[Project Cadmus|Cadmus]]'s files on a computer. One of the files is titled "Multiverse" and another file shows footage from the episode "A Better World" where the alternate Superman murders Lex Luthor. Ironically, after viewing files on the Justice Lords, he initially believes that instead of looking at an alternate universe, he is looking at the future of the universe in which the League lives. The exact means by how Cadmus came into possession of footage from the death of President Luthor seen in "A Better World" remains unknown.

=== ''Lois &amp; Clark: The New Adventures of Superman'' ===
{{Main|Lois &amp; Clark: The New Adventures of Superman}}

In ''Lois &amp; Clark: The New Adventures of Superman'', the show's primary protagonists, Lois Lane and [[Clark Kent]], encountered an alternative version Clark Kent from a parallel universe in the episodes "Tempus, Anyone?" and "Lois &amp; Clarks". In the episode "Tempus, Anyone?", the dimension included these differences:

* Clark Kent had not assumed the identity of Superman and was engaged to [[Lana Lang]] (prior to the events of "Tempus, Anyone?").
* Lois Lane had been lost on assignment in the Congo and presumed dead since 1993 (prior to the events of "Tempus, Anyone?" and "Lois &amp; Clarks").
* [[Jonathan and Martha Kent]] died when Clark was a child.
* [[Jimmy Olsen]] owns the [[Daily Planet]] and is also [[Perry White]]'s campaign manager for his mayoral election.
* Both [[Elvis Presley]] and [[Charlton Heston]] were elected as [[President of the United States of America]] (not to mention Elvis being alive and well).

The primary version of Lois, who was abducted by the villain Tempus and taken to this dimension, helped the alternate Clark become Superman, only to have Tempus expose his secret identity to the world on television. Despite Clark's alien origin, the world embraces him as their champion.

Later in the episode "Lois &amp; Clarks", the alternate Clark visits the primary ''L&amp;C'' dimension to aid Lois in stopping Tempus while the Clark Kent of her world is trapped in a time vortex. After Tempus' defeat, it is implied that the alternate Clark would travel to the past with [[H.G. Wells]] and take his reality's Lois Lane to his own time thus, under a [[predestination paradox]], explaining her disappearance.

=== Amalgam Comics ===
{{Main|Amalgam Comics}}

* Some issues in the two series from April 1996 and June 1997 (such as ''Spider-Boy Team-Up'' #1) state that a Crisis event known as the Secret Crisis of the Infinity Hour occurred and was related to alternate realities and timelines. The event is an amalgam of four major DC and Marvel crossover events (''Marvel Super Heroes Secret Wars'', ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'', ''The Infinity Gauntlet'' and ''Zero Hour: Crisis in Time'').
* In ''Challengers of the Fantastic'' #1, Reed "Prof" Richards is seen watching the parallel Universe-Two. It is hinted that this universe is an amalgam of DC's Earth-Two and Marvel's New Universe.
* ''Unlimited Access'' #4 shows glimpses of many amalgamated universes.
* The fictional letters in the letter sections of the April 1996 Amalgam Comics issues hint to an Amalgam Prime Earth, where the editor Stan Schwartz (an amalgam of Stan Lee and Julie Schwartz) and the film company Fox Bros. (an amalgam of 20th Century Fox and Warner Bros.) both exist.

=== ''Planetary'' ===
{{Main|Planetary (comics)}}

The [[WildStorm]] comic book series ''Planetary'' also introduced the concept of a multiverse, drawing upon the mathematical concept known as the [[Monster group]] for inspiration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url =http://warren-ellis.livejournal.com/2678.html | title =Mar. 27th, 2005 | accessdate =2006-11-10 | author =Warren Ellis | authorlink =Warren Ellis | date =2005-03-27 | work =Warren Ellis' Live Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The multiverse is described as "a theoretical snowflake existing in 196,833 dimensional space",&lt;ref&gt;{{Comic book reference | Writer =Warren Ellis  | Artist =John Cassaday | Title =Planetary | Issue =#2  | Date = April, 1999 | Publisher = DC Comics }}&lt;/ref&gt; a reference to the visualization method used by some mathematicians when describing the Monster group.

=== ''Smallville'' ===
{{Main|Smallville}}
&lt;!-- DESCRIPTION FOR THIS SECTION REQUIRES INFORMATION FROM THE FOLLOWING STORYLINES: ALIEN, LANTERN, CHAOS AND CONTINUITY. REFERENCES WILL BE NECESSARY.--&gt;

The live-action television series ''Smallville'' also featured the Multiverse concept. In the season 5 episode "Lexmas", Lex Luthor visits an alternate timeline where Lionel cuts Lex out of the family fortune while Lex is married to Lana and has a son named Alexander. Clark Kent is a reporter with the Daily Planet, Chloe is publishing a book exposing LuthorCorp with Lex's help, and Jonathan Kent is a state senator.

In the season 7 episode "Apocalypse," Clark is taken to an alternate timeline where his counterpart had not arrived in Smallville and is killed by [[Brainiac (character)|Brainiac]]. In that dimension, Clark Kent encounters another version of himself who is a human biological son of Martha and Jonathan and never met Lana Lang (who is a cheerleader with a different group of friends). Also in this dimension, Chloe Sullivan is engaged, Lana Lang is a married woman living in Paris, Sheriff Nancy Adams left Smallville and works as a member of the government, and Lex Luthor became President of the United States. While this dimension's Earth is destroyed by President Luthor, Clark travels back in time and sends his infant self to Earth, thus restoring his timeline.

In the season 10 episode "Luthor", Clark Kent travels to an alternate universe dubbed Earth-2 with the help of a Kryptonian mirror box. There, Lionel Luthor is his adopted father instead of Jonathan Kent. Clark is a bloodthirsty tyrant whose persona is [[Ultraman (comics)|Ultraman]]. He has a relationship with his adopted sister, Tess. Clark Luthor killed his adoptive brother Lex. When Clark Kent travels to the alternate earth, his counterpart, Clark Luthor, travels to his. Lois Lane is engaged to [[Green Arrow|Oliver Queen]], who bought land in Smallville for its kryptonite. Lionel lures Clark into Oliver's kryponite trap and beats him. With the help of Oliver (who closes the kryponite portal), Clark uses the mirror box and returns to his world. Unbeknownst to him, Lionel comes with him.

Earth-2 is featured again later in the season in the episode "Kent", as Clark Luthor returns to his counterpart's world once more, and Clark Kent meets Earth-2's Jonathan Kent.  After Clark Kent interacts with his deceased adoptive father's counterpart, he returns to his own world and lures Clark Luthor to the Fortress of Solitude, where he sends his counterpart back to his world.

In the fourth issue of the television series' comic book continuation ''Smallville Season 11'', an alternative version of [[Chloe Sullivan]] from Earth-2 arrives to Clark Kent's world and reveals that her universe is destroyed before her death.&lt;ref&gt;''Smallville Season 11'' vol. 1 #4 (August 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;  In issue #11, it is reveals that the Monitors are responsible for Earth-2's destruction.&lt;ref&gt;''Smallville Season 11'' vol. 1 #10 (February 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

Across this multiverse, there are other Earths featured in the series including:

*; Earth-9: This Earth was destroyed when it was torn asunder by collision with Earth-37, toppling into one another, because of a Bleed quake caused by a Monitor who did not follow the protocol.
*; Earth-13: This Earth was a parallel universe that co-existed as one with the Earth of the main Smallville universe. Not much is known about this universe as it was never shown, only merely mentioned. Its main feature was that its version of Clark Kent was a normal human and a wannabe hero, rather than a Kryptonian with superpowers, and Bruce Wayne, instead of being a superhero, is actually a psychopathic killer. Like many other universes, this Earth was also decimated. Earth-13 was destroyed when Earths-9 and -37 were torn asunder by collision, toppling into one another and shattering reality on Earth-13, because of a Bleed quake caused by a Monitor who did not follow the protocol. Its version of Clark managed to travel to the main Earth of Smallville. Unfortunately, he was followed by Bruce and he was killed by him there. Bruce Wayne remains the last survivor of his Earth, as he is held prisoner on Mars.
*; Earth-37: This Earth was destroyed when it was torn asunder by collision with Earth-9, toppling into one another, because of a Bleed quake caused by a Monitor who did not follow the protocol.
*; Earth-Majestic: This Earth is a parallel universe that co-exists as one with the Earth of the main Smallville universe. It is referred to as Earth-Majestic and its designation is unknown. It derives this name from its greatest superhero Mister Majestic, the alternate version of Superman. This Earth is the latest target of the Monitors, as they have already started the process to decimate it. It was later destroyed like the other Earths before it with the consciousness of Jor-El being the last survivor of this universe.
*; Earth-Omega: This Earth is a parallel universe that co-exists as one with the Earth of the main Smallville universe. It is referred to as Earth "Omega" and its designation is unknown. It derives this name from the Omega symbol, which is used by Darkseid. This Earth was attacked and seized by Apokolips and the two planets have collided with each other. Among the ruins are several fallen ships that belonged to the Monitors, wrecked Manhunters and skeletons of dead people. This Earth has not been destroyed entirely yet, because when the Monitors arrived there, Darkseid had already conquered that world. A catastrophic battle followed between the two parts, destroying almost everything around them. However, the Monitors, who, even though they suffered many casualties, succeeded in breaking Darkseid. After Superman made a deal with Darkseid, he gave him the crystal shard that contains the presence of Jor-El from Earth-Majestic. Darkseid threw the shard into the distance and a Fortress of Solitude formed, with Darkseid saying it could be a new beginning, a "'''New Genesis'''."

=== ''Batman: The Brave and the Bold'' ===
{{Main|Batman: The Brave and the Bold}}

In ''Batman: The Brave and the Bold'', a kind of "multiverse" is referenced in the episodes "Deep Cover for Batman!" and "Game Over for Owlman!", which feature several references to alternate incarnations of DC Comics heroes and villains, including the [[Batman]] and the [[Owlman (comics)|Owlman]]. The Multiverse is briefly revisited in "Night of the Batmen!", with a large group of Batmen gathered from across various Earths coming together to help an injured Bruce Wayne protect Gotham. The army of Multiverse Batmen contained various iterations of the Batman from different media adaptions, such as from ''[[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]]'', the DC Animated Universe, the 1960s ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'' TV series, and ''[[Batman Beyond]]''.

=== ''Justice League: Crisis on Two Earths'' ===
{{Main|Justice League: Crisis on Two Earths}}

The direct-to-video feature ''Justice League: Crisis on Two Earths'' deals with the Multiverse as part of its story. The main story deals with a good Lex Luthor from his Earth (based on the Pre-''Crisis'' [[Earth-Three]]) coming to the Earth where the Justice League are located to help fight their counterparts, the [[Crime Syndicate of America|Crime Syndicate]]. While the two Earths inhabited by the Justice League and Crime Syndicate are not named, names of other Earths are mentioned. These names are not from the official Pre-''Crisis'' nor post-''Infinite Crisis'' Multiverse, but are nods to a degree. Examples include: "Gamma F-1", "Theta-Alpha", "Zeta-Pi", which are all Greek numbers. [[Earth-Prime]] is featured in the film, but is not the same Earth-Prime from the comics, where it was "our" Earth. In the film, Earth-Prime is shown to be the cornerstone of all reality, and that decisions made by humankind on this world caused alternate Earths where the opposite decision was made to come into being. This world is shown to be a desolate barren wasteland of a planet, with ruins as far as the eye can see. It is unknown what exactly caused its desolation, though the Owlman reasons that it was [[Omnicide|mankind who destroyed itself]]. There was also an unnamed Earth that is mostly covered in ice. It was destroyed when the Owlman allowed the bomb to detonate with himself still on it.

=== ''DC Universe Online'' ===
{{Main|DC Universe Online}}

In the video game ''DC Universe Online'', [[Brainiac (character)|Brainiac]] decides to conquer New Earth in order to know the secret of the multiverse. After he was defeated, the heroes have to face the Council of Luthors, who wants to take control of the Nexus of Reality and rule existence through the achievement of ultimate power. But the Council of Batmen wishes to stop the Luthors and undo the damage that has been done.

=== ''Green Lantern: The Animated Series'' ===

{{expand section|date=February 2016}}

=== ''Injustice'' ===
{{Main|Injustice: Gods Among Us|Injustice 2}}

The storyline of ''[[Injustice: Gods Among Us]]'' features an alternate reality where the Joker has tricked Superman into killing Lois Lane and their unborn son and destroying Metropolis with a nuclear explosion. This tragedy completely ruins Superman's moral compass to the point of no return and the Kryptonian murders the Joker in retaliation. As time passes, he establishes a new world order, with himself as the High Councilor. Soon enough, Superman's iron-fisted rule triggers a war between the Regime and those allied with the Batman's Insurgency. High Councilor Superman begins a relationship with Wonder Woman who becomes one of his most devoted followers. Damian Wayne eventually sides with Superman against his father and kills Victor Zsasz. Cyborg also joins the Regime due to sharing his anger over the destruction of Metropolis. Dick Grayson is accidentally killed by Damian Wayne, which creates an even further rift between himself and his father, who mourns the death of his adopted son while Damian eventually adopts Dick's mantle of Nightwing. Harley Quinn leads a group called the Joker Gang who idolizes the Joker and fights alongside the Insurgency against the Regime. Both Black Adam and Billy Batson (Shazam) join the Regime. Hal Jordan becomes Yellow Lantern after joining the Sinestro Corps. which has allied itself with Superman's Regime against the Green Lantern Corps. The Green Arrow is killed by the Regime, leaving behind the Black Canary who is pregnant with their son Connor. The Black Canary is saved by Doctor Fate who transports her to an alternate Earth where Oliver Queen is still alive, though he has lost his Black Canary. Five years into the war, the Insurgency discovers an alternate universe where the Joker's plan did not succeed and transports several of its superheroes (Wonder Woman, the Batman, Aquaman, the Green Arrow, and Green Lantern) to their world in order to help them defeat the Regime. Unfortunately, the Joker of this universe is brought to the Regime universe and is killed. Also in this universe, Lex Luthor never becomes a criminal and instead he is a selfless businessman, best friend of this world's Superman and cares for the people of Metropolis, though he secretly sides with the Batman against the tyrannical Superman, only to be killed in battle. Together with the alternate universe Justice League and the Regime Flash, who defects from the Regime after Superman murders Shazam when he objects to Superman's plans to attack cities, the Regime Superman is defeated and imprisoned in the Red Son prison along with fellow Regime members Cyborg and Damian Wayne (Nightwing). Hal Jordan and Sinestro are imprisoned on Oa by the Guardians. The Flash allows himself to be taken into custody to face charges for his role in the Regime. After the Regime's fall, Bruce Wayne works to rebuild the world after the fall of the Regime. The alternate Justice League return to their universe.

The ''Injustice'' universe is featured at the beginning of ''[[Convergence (comics)|Convergence]]'' as one of the many realities affected by [[Arak (comics)|Telos]]' Blood Moon.

In ''[[Injustice 2]]'', it is revealed that Krypton in this universe was attacked by Brainiac who collects the city of Kandor and destroys Argo City, which Kara Zor-El barely survives. Her mother saves her from Brainiac's Betas and reveals that Brainiac has destabilized the planet's core. Kara is tasked with watching over her baby cousin Kal-El and flees Krypton in a spaceship at the behest of her mother; however, her ship is damaged and knocked off course by the planet's explosion, which puts her into suspended animation. She is later found drifting through space by Black Adam, who takes her to Kahndaq where he and Wonder Woman have been hiding out since Superman was imprisoned. Black Adam and Wonder Woman train her in the hopes that her strength will give them the edge to free Kal-El. A flashback shows how Robin (Damian Wayne) joins Superman after killing the remorseless serial killer Victor Zsasz (which retcons the nature and timing of Damain's murder of Zsasz from the ''Injustice'' prequel comics). In the present, Damian Wayne and Cyborg are also incarcerated with Superman, while Aquaman has distanced himself away from the Regime to protect Atlantis. Meanwhile, Bruce is busy with the rebuilding the world after the Regime, forcing him to enlist other heroes such as the Black Canary, her husband the Green Arrow (from the alternate universe that the Black Canary was sent to by Doctor Fate), Firestorm and the Blue Beetle/Jaime Reyes as well as Harley Quinn, the Flash (who had been pardoned due to his role in taking down the Regime after the murder of Billy Batson by Superman) and Hal Jordan, who was reinstated as Green Lantern by the Guardians of the Universe, who managed to rehabilitate him. The Batman also constructs [[Brother Eye]] to monitor Earth for the Regime, the Society, and other potential threats. The Batman tasks the Black Canary, the Green Arrow, and Harley to deal with the Society, a group of supervillains formed by Gorilla Grodd after the fall of the Regime. During their confrontation with the Society in Gorilla City, they learn of an even greater threat posed by Brainiac which leads to the three being captured, though Harley escapes thanks to the intervention of the Catwoman, who had infiltrated the Society as an undercover mole. Brainiac hacks into Brother Eye and demands that Superman be handed over to him, though Bruce suits up and flees from the Batcave. Supergirl informs Wonder Woman and Black Adam of the threat posed by Brainiac and tells them they must get to her cousin before it is too late. This leads Kara and the Regime to break into the Red Son prison to free Superman, Cyborg, and Damian Wayne. However, the Blue Beetle and Firestorm protect the prison, but they are overwhelmed. Firestorm plans to destroy the Regime with a nuclear explosion, but the Batman tells him to stand down and decides that the threat posed by Brainiac is too great, leading the Insurgency and Regime to join forces to battle a common enemy. However, Supergirl begins to question what she had been told when Wonder Woman stabs Harley for trying to stop her from killing the Cheetah. Kara manages to save Harley's life, confronts her cousin and realizes that he has become a ruthless dictator like General Zod. After a brief battle with Robin, Black Adam, and Superman after her attempts to reason with Superman fail, they are interrupted by Brainiac's attack and Superman tells his cousin she must choose a side when it is over. During the battle with Brainiac's Skull Ship, Metropolis is destroyed again and Superman apparently killed. The Batman consoles Kara and tells her about how Superman was his friend once and refuses to accept Brainiac's proposal that he will spare Earth if Kara is handed over to him. She later joins the Batman in infiltrating Brainiac's ship, but Kara is captured, though Superman is revealed to be alive and he teams up with the Batman to stop Brainiac and save Kara. However, after Brainiac's defeat (which frees Kara) and Superman stopping the Skull Ship from crashing, the Regime and Insurgency clashes over how to deal with Brainiac as the Insurgency believes that if they spare Brainiac they will discover how to restore the collected cities and free their inhabitants, while Superman plans to kill Brainiac and restore the Regime, though Supergirl sides with the Insurgency, understanding that the Regime was planning to betray the Insurgency as soon as Brainiac was defeated. The story has two different endings.

* If Batman is selected, Kara works with the Batman and the Insurgency to defeat her cousin, though the Batman apologizes to Kara that she was not able to save Superman from himself. Superman is then imprisoned in the Phantom Zone though he swears to return, while the Batman convinces Kara that she can be a hero like her cousin had once been.
* If Superman is selected, then he confronts the redeemed Hal Jordan and the Flash, defeating them both. He also tells Kara that he is tired of holding back for fear of hurting others as he believes it is that fear that led to Lois' death. Kara laments that she is thankful that his father is not alive to see the person he has become, though Superman says that if his father had been more like Zod, he might have been able to save Krypton. Superman defeats both Kara and the Batman. The Batman, expecting to be killed, goads him to show him what a true villain he has become, though Superman relents, not wanting to make the Batman a martyr, and believes Kara will come around. He kills Brainiac and becomes one with his ship. Kara is imprisoned in Superman's old Red Son prison cell, where Superman shows her he has completely merged with Brainiac's ship and asks her if she will reconsider his offer to rule alongside him as family, before revealing to Kara's horror that he has gained Brainiac's ability to control others, which he demonstrates by showing her the Batman, who has been brainwashed by Superman, and suggests he will do the same to Kara if she refuses. Superman plans to expand his Regime into a Legion by recruiting beings from Brainiac's collection. He plans to use this Legion to bring peace to his universe and the multiverse. In the game's Multiverse Mode, Brother Eye monitors the infinite Multiverse for threats, sending heroes to combat threats or aid allies from other universes.

=== ''Infinite Crisis'' (video game) ===
{{Main|Infinite Crisis (video game)}}

The video game ''Infinite Crisis'' (which is unrelated to the [[Infinite Crisis|comic book of the same name]]) features a multiverse with 52 different worlds. This multiverse is threatened by a sudden assault and all realities stand on the brink of annihilation. Now, the last hope for Earth lies in the powers of the DC legends.

During the events of the tie-in comic book ''Infinite Crisis: Fight for the Multiverse'', it is said that the Monitors were a race of beings native to the world of Nil that resided outside all realities in the Overvoid. Their existence came following the creation of the Multiverse and the Bleed where they watched the infinite Earths and sought to protect the infinite strands of creation. It was claimed that they were a people that cared little about the existence of the inhabitants of these universes and more for the preservation of their grand order. Such was their existence, until one of their kind turned against the others and became the Anti-Monitor. A Crisis emerged as a result whereby many universes were destroyed, but the Anti-Monitor was defeated at the cost of almost the entire Monitor race. From this Crisis, there existed only 52 universes left in the Multiverse that were kept in perfect balance. The only survivor of their race was Nix Uotan, who detected a new Crisis emerging from an unknown menace who made use of corrupted Monitor technology and struck at Earth-48. Nix Uotan returned to his people's home world in order to reactivate the machinery to help contain the damage from the Crisis. As a result, he began to seek out champions and even villains to help combat this menace from across the Multiverse. These individuals would be charged with recovering artifacts from across the many Earths that were being taken by the mysterious enemy to aid in their assault. Among his agents was a human female from Earth-48 who went by the name of Harbinger.

The featured alternate Earths are those of the [[New 52]] DC Multiverse.

* Prime Earth is Earth-0, DC's core alternate universe.
* "Arcane" Earth is Earth-13.
* "Atomic" Earth is the post-apocalyptic Earth-17.
*  "[[Gotham by Gaslight|Gaslight]]" Earth is the [[Edwardian]] analogue [[steampunk]] Earth-19.
* "Nightmare" Earth is the vampiric metahuman-dominated Earth-43.
* "Mecha" Earth is Earth-44, on which robotics scientists created the Metal/Mecha League, analogues of Prime Earth superheroes.

[[Superman]], [[Supergirl]], [[Poison Ivy (character)|Poison Ivy]], the [[Joker (character)|Joker]], [[Harley Quinn]], the [[Catwoman]],  [[Wonder Woman]], the [[Batman]] and [[Robin (comics)|Robin]] are featured as player possibilities, each with alternate versions amongst the six featured alternate Earth scenarios.

In this reality, the Monitors had access to energy constructs that were able to record messages and transmit communiques across the Multiverse. They also forged orbs that glowed with light and served as a guide across the alternate universes as well as serve as a communicator with the Monitors. On their homeworld of Nil, there were spatial engines that could be used to help prevent large scale universal breaches that would damage the Multiverse.

=== Arrowverse and DC Extended Universe ===
{{Main|Arrowverse|DC Extended Universe}}

In July 2014, DC CCO [[Geoff Johns]] confirmed that the universe present in the publisher's television series, ''[[Arrow (TV series)|Arrow]]'' and ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]'', is separate from the one being built in their films with ''[[Man of Steel (film)|Man of Steel]]'' and ''[[Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice]]''. In October 2014, Johns explained DC's difference in approach to [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]], saying "We look at it as the multiverse. We have our TV universe and our film universe, but they all co-exist. For us, creatively, it's about allowing everyone to make the best possible product, to tell the best story, to do the best world. Everyone has a vision and you really want to let the visions shine through...It's just a different approach."

The Multiverse concept is explored during the second season of ''The Flash'', which is pivotal to the conflicts between Barry Allen ([[Grant Gustin]]) and rogue speedster [[Hunter Zolomon]] ([[Teddy Sears]]). The access points to the Multiverse are portals that were created as a result of an exploding singularity over Central City during the season 2 premiere "The Man Who Saved Central City". In the episode "Enter Zoom", it is revealed that Earth-2's version of the [[Green Arrow]] is Robert Queen ([[Jamey Sheridan]]) instead of his son [[Oliver Queen (Arrow)|Oliver]] ([[Stephen Amell]]), who presumably died on the boat accident. In the season 2 finale "The Race of His Life", Zoom reveals that the universe in which that of ''Arrow'', ''The Flash'' and ''[[Legends of Tomorrow]]'' sets is positioned in the Multiverse's center, and from there one could travel to any of the other infinite numbers of Earths.  After [[Jay Garrick]] is rescued from Zoom, he reveals that he is from yet another Earth, designated Earth-3. In the Season 3 episode "The New Rogues", the Flash team explore the multiverse in search of a [[Harrison Wells]] doppelganger to replace the Earth-2 version. They encounter four others from various Earths, two of which are named Earth-17 and Earth-19, from which their new recruit, Harrison "H.R." Wells, originates.

The television series ''[[Supergirl (TV series)|Supergirl]]'' exists as another alternate universe separate from the main Arrowverse continuity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2016/02/supergirl-the-flash-crossover-official-in-march-1201695796/|title=Crossover Confirmed: 'The Flash' To Meet 'Supergirl' In March Episode|last=Lincoln|first=Ross A.|date=February 3, 2016|accessdate=February 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is confirmed in the ''Supergirl'' episode "[[Worlds Finest]]", when the Flash appears on Supergirl's universe and names heroes from his world (the Green Arrow, the Black Canary, the Atom, Firestorm) that Supergirl does not recognize. In addition, the Flash's allies Dr. Harrison Wells, Caitlin Snow, and Cisco Ramon do not exist in Supergirl's universe, and S.T.A.R. Labs was not founded due to Wells' absence. Barry Allen does note that they do share celebrities, such as singer [[Mariah Carey]] and writer [[Alexandre Dumas]], who wrote ''[[The Three Musketeers]]''. Supergirl's universe is coined Earth-38 by Cisco Ramon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.inverse.com/article/24447-the-flash-supergirl-lives-earth-38-multiverse|title='The Flash' Just Announced That Supergirl Lives on Earth-38|publisher=Inverse|last=Francisco|first=Eric|date=November 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent episodes from ''Legends of Tomorrow,'' ''Supergirl,'' and ''The Flash'' reveal that both Supergirl and Barry's universes also share the existences of the alien races of [[Thanagar]]ians and [[Dominators (DC Comics)|Dominators]].

The 2017 crossover event ''[[Crisis on Earth-X]]''- which sees the heroes from all four shows face an invasion from the titular 'Earth-X', as a world where the Nazis won [[World War II]]- establishes that there are 52 known alternate Earths, with the titular 'Earth-X' being the fifty-third Earth, described by Harrison "Harry" Wells of Earth-2, that those who aware of the multiverse as being so dark and horrific that no interdimensional traveler would dare to journey there. Its history is basically the same as Earth-1, Earth-2, and Earth-38's, except the outcomes of World War II and [[Adolf Hitler]] continued his reign worldwide until his death in 1994. Its inhabitants include counterparts of people from these Earths as well, including Oliver Queen's doppelgänger, who is Hitler's successor as Führer and the villainous archer the Dark Arrow.

=== ''Teen Titans'' ===
{{Main|Teen Titans}}

Issue #48 introduces its own multiverse. Each world pays references to various incarnation of the [[Teen Titans]]. The worlds shown are:

* The majority of the story is set on a world which is menaced by the Teen Tyrants (evil Teen Titans), and is defended by the Brotherhood of Justice (heroic versions of the [[Brotherhood of Evil]]). Similar to [[Crime Syndicate of America|Earth-3]].
* Malchior's (from the ''[[Teen Titans (TV series)|Teen Titans]]'' episode "Spellbound") homeworld.
* A world similar to the past from the ''Teen Titans'' episode "[[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg]] the Barbarian".
* A world containing the teen [[Lobo (DC Comics)|Lobo]].
* A world consisting of the animalistic Teen Titans (from the ''Teen Titans'' episode "Bunny [[Raven (DC Comics)|Raven]]").
* Another future timeline with [[Dick Grayson|Nightwing]] (from the ''Teen Titans'' episode "How Long Is Forever").

== Parodies ==
* [[Bongo Comics]] published a comic book series featuring characters from ''[[The Simpsons]]'' and ''Futurama'' titled ''Futurama/Simpsons Infinitely Secret Crossover Crisis''. One of the conventions of DC's Multiverse that the series parodies is the existence of one universe's characters as fictional comic book characters in another.
* [[IDW Publishing|IDW]]'s ''Super Secret Crisis War!'', parodies DC's ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'' and [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]]'s ''[[Secret Wars|Marvel Super Heroes Secret Wars]]'' in their logo as this is a major crossover event featuring several characters and their worlds from their [[Cartoon Network]]-based publications.

In [[romance languages]], '''''nomen à clef''''' or '''''nomen à clé''''' ({{IPA-fr|nomen‿a kle|}}, French for "name with a key"), is a [[name]] describing a real person, behind a façade of [[fiction]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=VxFomoeKT74C&amp;pg=PA131&amp;dq=film+%C3%A0+clef&amp;lr=&amp;ei=mFMTS4H2FpCuzQSZ3737DA#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false "The films in my life" By François Truffaut, Da Capo Press, 1994, ISBN 0-306-80599-5, ISBN 978-0-306-80599-8, pg 131]&lt;/ref&gt; "Key" in this context means a table one can use to swap out the names.  
It is the nomenclature complement of the [[roman à clef]].

In the [[Typology (archaeology)|typology]] of [[ancient Roman pottery]], the ''olla'' is a vessel distinguished by its rounded “belly,” typically with no or small handles or at times with [[volute]]s at the lip, and made within a Roman sphere of influence; the term ''olla'' may also be used for [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]]&lt;ref&gt;W.J.

In [[Religion in ancient Rome|ancient Roman religion]], ''ollae'' (plural) have ritual use and significance, including as [[cinerary urn]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Entry on “olla,” ''[[Oxford Latin Dictionary]]'' (Oxford: Clarendon Press 1982, 1985 printing), p. 1246; David Noy, “‘Half-Burnt on an Emergency Pyre’: Roman Cremations Which Went Wrong,” ''Greece &amp; Rome'' 47 (2000), p. 186.&lt;/ref&gt; In the study of [[Gallo-Roman art]] and [[Gallo-Roman culture|culture]], an ''olla'' is the small pot carried by [[Sucellus]], by the mallet god often identified with him, or by other gods.

==Cookery==
[[File:Roman Museum 049.jpg|thumb|left|250px|''Ollae'' of varying shapes in a reconstruction of a Roman kitchen; top shelf, and on the rack over the fire]]
''Olla'' is a generic word for a cooking pot, such as would be used for vegetables, porridge, pulse and such.&lt;ref&gt;White, ''Farm Equipment'', p. 176.&lt;/ref&gt; The 1st-century BC scholar [[Varro]] gives an "absurd" etymology&lt;ref&gt;White, ''Farm Equipment'', p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt; that derives the word for vegetables, ''olera'' or ''holera'', from ''olla''; although as a matter of scientific [[linguistics]] the derivation may be incorrect, it indicates that cookery was considered essential to the pot's function.&lt;ref&gt;Varro, ''De lingua latina'' 5.108.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Isidore of Seville]] said that the word ''olla'' derived from ''ebullit'', "it boils up," and describes a [[patera]] as an ''olla'' with the sides flattened out more broadly.&lt;ref&gt;Isidore, ''[[Etymologiae]]'' 20.8.1.&lt;/ref&gt; It was a word of ordinary usage, and does not appear in [[Latin literature|literary works]] by [[Vergil]], [[Horace]], and [[Ovid]].

Unlike the ''aenum'' or cauldron, which hung over the fire from chains, the ''olla'' had a flat bottom for resting on a hot surface, though it might also be placed directly on logs or coals in rustic cookery.&lt;ref&gt;White, ''Farm Equipment'', p. 178, citing [[Martial]].&lt;/ref&gt; The kitchen reconstructed at the [[House of the Vettii]] from [[Pompeii]] shows a large ''olla'' set on a [[tripod]] on the stove.&lt;ref&gt;White, ''Farm Equipment'', p. 179.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Funerary use==
{{See also|Roman funerals and burial}}
''Ollae'' were used for funerary purposes from earliest times. In [[Italic peoples|Italic]] [[inhumation]]s, ''ollae'' might be placed with the body in the tomb as [[grave goods]], sometimes with a ladle or dipper.&lt;ref&gt;Helle W. Horsnaes, ''The Cultural Development in Northwestern Lucania c. 600–274 BC'' («L'Erma» di Bretschneider, 2002), pp. 67–68, 89, 95, 148, 173.&lt;/ref&gt; A tomb from a 7th-century BC [[necropolis]] at [[Civita Castellana]] yielded an ''olla'' decorated with a pair of horses and a [[Faliscan language|Faliscan]] inscription.&lt;ref&gt;Gabriel C.L.M. Bakkum, ''The Latin Dialect of the Ager Faliscus'' (Amsterdam University Press, 2009), p. 414.&lt;/ref&gt; From the 3rd century BC ([[Roman Republic#Mid-Republic (274 BC - 148 BC)|Mid-Republic]]) into the 2nd century AD of the [[Roman Empire|Imperial era]], [[cremation]] was the most characteristic means of disposing of a body among the Romans. ''Ollae'' shifted function to hold cremated remains for entombment, a practice of Etruscan as well as Italic burials.&lt;ref&gt;Giovannangelo Camporeale, ''The Etruscans Outside Etruria'' (Arsenale-EBS, 2001), pp. 162–163, 197.&lt;/ref&gt; The remains of those of modest means might be contained in earthenware ''ollae'' placed on the shelves of an ''ollarium'' or [[columbarium]].&lt;ref&gt;White, ''Farm Equipment'', p. 179.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sacrificial use==
After the performance of an [[animal sacrifice]], a designated portion of the entrails ''([[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#exta|exta]])'' was placed either in an ''olla'' and boiled, or in oldest times on a spit and roasted,&lt;ref&gt;Robert Schilling, "Roman Sacrifice," ''Roman and European Mythologies'' (University of Chicago Press, 1992, from the French edition of 1981), p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt; as part of the "cuisine" of sacrifice. The ''exta'' were the [[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#victima|victim]]'s liver, gall, lungs, and the membrane covering the intestines, with the heart added after 275 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Turcan, ''The Gods of Ancient Rome'' (Routledge, 2001, originally published in French 1998), p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''olla'' was one of the characteristic implements of sacrifice, and appears in [[relief]]s as such, particularly in the [[Roman Gaul|Gallic provinces]].&lt;ref&gt;Duncan Fishwick, ''Imperial Cult in the Latin West'' (Brill, 1990), vol. II.1, p. 527.&lt;/ref&gt; The vessel is mentioned, for instance, in [[Livy]]'s account of a sign ''([[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#prodigium|prodigium]])'' that manifested divine displeasure: the official presiding over the sacrifice himself poured the cooking liquid out of the ''olla'' in order to inspect the remaining entrails, which were intact except for the mysteriously liquified liver.&lt;ref&gt;[[Livy]], 41.15.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arval Brethren===
''Ollae'' figured in the rituals of the [[Arval Brethren]], the "Brothers of the Fields" who constituted a [[collegium|college]] of priests dating from Rome's archaic period. The ''exta'' of the victims used in their sacrifices were placed in an ''olla'' and cooked.&lt;ref&gt;Schilling, "Roman Sacrifice," p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of these earthenware pots have been uncovered by archaeologists in the [[lucus|sacred grove]]s of the Arvals. Their rudimentary technique suggests the great antiquity of the religious traditions associated with them.&lt;ref&gt;Schilling, "The Arval Brethren," p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt; After conducting their rites, the Arval priests opened the door to the temple, and cast the ''ollae'' down the slope leading up to it.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Warde Fowler]], ''The Religious Experience of the Roman People'', (London, 1922), p. 489.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Silvanus and the Mallet God==
[[File:Sucellus MAN St Germain.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Gallo-Roman religion|Gallic]] mallet god with ''olla'', perhaps Sucellus]]
{{expand section|date=May 2011}}
The name of the woodland god [[Silvanus (mythology)|Silvanus]] appears in inscriptions within the [[Roman province|province]] of [[Gallia Narbonensis]] with representations of a mallet, an ''olla'', or both. The mallet is not a regular attribute of Silvanus, and may be borrowed from the Celtic mallet god sometimes identified with [[Sucellus]].&lt;ref&gt;Peter F. Dorcey, ''The Cult of Silvanus: A Study in Roman Folk Religion'' (Brill, 1992), pp. 57–59.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Oper am Gänsemarkt.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Decoration during a festival in honour of [[George I of Great Britain|George I]] of Great Britain]]

The '''Oper am Gänsemarkt''' was a theatre in [[Hamburg]], Germany, built in 1678 after plans of [[Girolamo Sartorio]] at the [[Gänsemarkt]] square. It was the first public opera house to be established in Germany: not a court opera, as in many other towns. Everybody could buy a ticket, like in Venice. Most works were in the German language or translated librettos (from Italian). 

The building was torn down in 1756, but rebuilt in 1765.

==History==
Hamburg was a rich city and hardly affected by the [[Thirty Years' War]]. 

The founding of the Hamburg opera was an initiative of the well-traveled lawyer and alderman Gerhard Schott, who was impressed by Italian opera and [[Johann Adam Reincken]], a local church organist.&lt;ref&gt;Jaacks, G. (1997) Hamburg zu Lust und Nutz. Bürgerliches Musikverständnis zwischen Barock und Aufklärung (1660-1760), p. 81-83.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Haven, K. van der (2008) Achter de schermen van het stadstoneel. Theaterbedrijf en toneelpolemiek in Amsterdam en Hamburg 1675-1750, p. 40, 48.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Johann Theile]], [[Kapellmeister]] of [[Christian Albert, Duke of Holstein-Gottorp]], who lived during the years 1675-1679 and 1684-1689 in exile in the city, organised its first performance. 
For the construction of the stage the Italian engineer and architect [[Girolamo Sartorio]] was attracted by the private company.&lt;ref&gt;Wendt, J.R.M. (2002) Materialien zur Geschichte der frühen Hamburger Oper, p. 21-22&lt;/ref&gt; Protests and accusations by some Hamburg ministers before and after the opening held on for several years, and is known as the first "Hamburger Theaterstreit".

The opening of the house took place on 2 January 1678 with [[Johann Theile]]'s sacred opera ''Adam und Eva'', succeeded by works of [[Nicolò Minato]] and [[Antonio Sartorio]], [[Johann Wolfgang Franck]] with ''Cara Mustapha'' (1686), [[Agostino Steffani]], [[Carlo Pallavicino]] and [[Johann Sigismund Kusser]].&lt;ref&gt;Dean, W. &amp; J.M. Knapp (1995) Handel's Operas 1694-1726, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of an argument with the management, Kusser organized an opera in the [[refectory]] of the [[St. Mary's Cathedral, Hamburg|local Dom]]. 

In 1695 [[Reinhard Keiser]] took over the post of [[Kapellmeister]] until 1718; from 1703 to 1707 he also held the directorship. In 1703 [[George Frideric Handel|Handel]] came from Halle to Hamburg as a cembalist and violin player, and a famous duel took place between Handel and Mattheson, during and after which ''Cleopatra'' was performed. One of the musicians was [[Christoph Graupner]]. In 1705 (?) Handel met with [[Gian Gastone de' Medici]], who invited him to [[Pratolino]].

[[Agostino Steffani]], [[Johann Mattheson]], [[Georg Friedrich Händel]], [[Nicolaus Adam Strungk]], [[Johann Philipp Förtsch]], [[Georg Bronner]], [[Johann Philipp Krieger]], [[Georg Caspar Schürmann]],  and [[Johann Georg Conradi]] composed [[Singspiele]] or [[baroque opera]]'s for the Hamburg opera. There were performances on two or three days a week, and around 90 performances a year. The opera season started in Winter; in Summer and on religious holidays the theatre was closed. Because of the long scene changes each performance took four to six hours and began by afternoon.

In 1722 [[Georg Philipp Telemann]] took over the management of the opera house, which he held until the end of 1738. In 1727 the first German opera "Dafne" (lost) by [[Heinrich Schütz]] was performed. From 1743 till 1750 the building was used by [[Angelo Mingotti]], performing Italian opera's by  [[Johann Adolph Hasse]] and [[Giovanni Battista Pergolesi|Pergolesi]].&lt;ref&gt;Marx, H.J. &amp; D. Schröder (1995) Die Hamburger Gänsemarkt-Oper, p. 502-507.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Christoph Willibald Gluck]] performed his works in 1748.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hamburgballett.de/d/oper.htm Ein Opernhaus für Hamburg] hamburgballett.de {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1750 the building was sold.

==Second house==
Between 1767 and 1770 [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing]] was the dramatist in what was called [[Hamburg National Theatre|Deutsches Nationaltheater]].

'''Persian calligraphy''' ({{lang-fa|خوشنویسی فارسی}}) or '''Iranian calligraphy''' ({{lang-fa|خوشنویسی ایرانی}}) is the [[calligraphy]] of the [[Persian script|Persian language]]. It is one of the most revered arts throughout [[history of Iran]].

==History==
[[File:Nastaliq-proportions.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Example showing Nastaʿlīq's proportion rules.{{ref label|Smith1989|1|a}}]]
{{further information|Nastaʿlīq}}

===History of Nasta'liq===
After the [[Muslim conquest of Persia|introduction of Islam]] in the 7th century, Persians adapted the Arabic alphabet to [[Persian language|Persian]] and developed the contemporary Persian alphabet. The Arabic alphabet has 28 characters. An additional four letters were added by Iranians [http://www.persiancalligraphy.org/History-of-Calligraphy.html [2&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;], which resulted in the 32 letters currently present in the Persian alphabet.

Around one thousand years ago, [[Ibn Muqlah]] ({{lang-fa|{{Nastaliq|ابنِ مقله بيضاوی شيرازی}}}}) and his brother created six genres of Iranian calligraphy, namely "Mohaqiq", "Reyhan", "Sols", "Naskh", "Toqi" and "[[Reqa]]". These genres were common for four centuries in Persia. In the 7th century (Hijri calendar), Hassan Farsi Kateb combined the "Naskh" and "Reqah" styles and invented a new genre of Persian calligraphy named "[[Ta'liq (script)|Ta'liq]]". In the 14th century, Mir Ali Tabrizi combined two major scripts of his time, i.e. Naskh and Taliq, and created a new Persian calligraphic style called "Nas’taliq"[http://www.persiancalligraphy.org/History-of-Calligraphy.html [2&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;]. In the past 500 years [[Nastaʿlīq]] (also anglicized as '''Nastaleeq'''; {{lang-fa|{{Nastaliq|نستعلیق}}}} ''{{transl|fa|nastaʿlīq}}'') has been the predominant style for writing the [[Perso-Arabic script]].

In the 17th century Morteza Gholi Khan Shamlou and Mohammad Shafi Heravi created a new genre called cursive Nastaʿlīq [[Shekasteh Nastaʿlīq]] ([[Persian language|Persian]]: '''&lt;span lang="fa" dir="rtl"&gt;شکسته&lt;/span&gt;''' &lt;span lang="fa" dir="rtl"&gt;'''نستعلیق'''&lt;/span&gt;). Almost a century later, Abdol-Majid Taleqani, who was a prominent artist at the time, brought this genre to its highest level. This calligraphic style is based on the same rules as Nas’taliq. However, cursive Nas’taliq has a few significant differences: it provides more flexible movements, and it is slightly more stretched and curved. Yadollah Kaboli is one of the most prominent contemporary calligraphers within this style.

==Contemporary Persian calligraphy==
In 1950, the ''[[Society of Iranian Calligraphists|Iran's Association of Calligraphers]]'' was founded by Hossein Mirkhani, Ali Akbar Kaveh, Ebrahim Bouzari, Hassan Mirkhani and Mehdi Baiani. For an overview of Persian calligraphy's development within Afghanistan, see "Calligraphy during last two centuries in Afghanistan" (1964), by Azizuddin Vakili.

===Modernist movement===
[[:fa:حسين زنده‌رودي|Zendeh Roudi]], [[Jalil Rasouli]], [[Parviz Tanavoli]], and [[Nima Behnoud]] use Persian calligraphy and Rumi poetry in dress designing.
&lt;br /&gt;

===Post modernism===
[[abol atighetchi, abolghassem]] uses combination of colored naskh, suluth and kufic style calligraphy with large letters in a single large format acrylic painting for his work presentation and circles in gold leaf or simple color to decorate but in the nastaligh style lots of colorful geometrical forms and lines are used to modernize the painting and also the same technique is used to modernize the large format birds of bessmel (مرغ بسمل), all drawn with large letters.this style of work can be classified as post modern.

[[Image:Matthew Arnold - Project Gutenberg eText 16745.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The British poet and cultural critic [[Matthew Arnold]] adapted the German word ''Philister'' to English as the word ''philistine'' to denote [[anti-intellectualism]].]]

In the fields of [[philosophy]] and [[aesthetics|æsthetics]], the derogatory term '''philistinism''' describes “the manners, habits, and character, or mode of thinking of a philistine”, manifested as an [[anti-intellectualism|anti-intellectual]] social attitude that undervalues and despises [[art]] and [[beauty]], [[intellectualism|intellect]] and [[spirituality]].&lt;ref name="Unabridged 1951"&gt;''Webster's New Twentieth Century Dictionary of the English Language – Unabridged'' (1951) p. 1260&lt;/ref&gt; A '''philistine''' person is a man or woman of smugly narrow mind and of [[Convention (norm)|conventional]] morality whose [[Economic materialism|materialistic]] views and tastes indicate a lack of and an indifference to cultural and æsthetic values.&lt;ref&gt;''College Edition: Webster's New World Dictionary of the American Language'' (1962) p. 1099&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 19th century, the contemporary denotation of ''philistinism'', as the behaviour of "ignorant, ill-behaved persons lacking in culture or artistic appreciation, and only concerned with materialistic values" derives from Matthew Arnold's adaptation to English of the German word '''''Philister''''', as applied by university students in their antagonistic relations with the townspeople of [[Jena]], Germany, where, in 1689, a row resulted in several deaths.

In the aftermath, the university cleric addressed the town-vs-gown matter with an admonishing sermon "The Philistines Be Upon Thee", drawn from the ''[[Book of Judges]]'' (Chapt. 16, 'Samson vs the Philistines'), of the [[Tanakh]] and of the Christian [[Old Testament]].&lt;ref&gt;''Benét's Reader's Encyclopedia'' Third Edition (1987) p. 759&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Word Research and Word History'', the philologist [[Friedrich Kluge]] said that the word ''philistine'' originally had a positive meaning that identified a tall and strong man, such as [[Goliath]]; later the meaning changed to identify the "guards of the city".&lt;ref name="Kluge"&gt; Friedrich Kluge, ''Wortforschung und Wortgeschichte''&lt;/ref&gt;  

== History ==
In German usage, university students applied the term '''Philister''' (Philistine) to describe a person who was not trained at university; in the German social context, the term identified the man ('''Philister''') and the woman ('''Philisterin''') who was not of the university social set.&lt;ref name="Unabridged 1951"/&gt;

In English usage, as a descriptor of [[anti-intellectualism]], the term '''philistine'''—a person deficient in the culture of the [[liberal arts]]—was common British usage by the decade of 1820, which described the [[Bourgeoisie|bourgeois]], merchant [[middle class]] of the [[Victorian Era]] (1837–1901), whose wealth rendered them indifferent to culture. In ''[[Culture and Anarchy|Culture and Anarchy: An Essay in Political and Social Criticism]]'' (1869), Matthew Arnold said:

{{Quotation|Now, the use of culture is that it helps us, by means of its spiritual standard of perfection, to regard wealth as but machinery, and not only to say as a matter of words that we regard wealth as but machinery, but really to perceive and feel that it is so. If it were not for this purging effect wrought upon our minds by culture, the whole world, the future, as well as the present, would inevitably belong to the Philistines. The people who believe most that our greatness and welfare are proved by our being very rich, and who most give their lives and thoughts to becoming rich, are just the people whom we call the Philistines. Culture says: “Consider these people, then, their way of life, their habits, their manners, the very tones of their voices; look at them attentively; observe the literature they read, the things which give them pleasure, the words which come forth out of their mouths, the thoughts which make the furniture of their minds; would any amount of wealth be worth having with the condition that one was to become just like these people by having it?”| Culture and Anarchy (1869) pp. 28–29. }}

The denotations and connotations of the terms ''philistinism'' and ''philistine'' have evolved to consistently describe the uncouth person who is hostile to [[art]], [[High culture|culture]], and the [[Intellectualism|life of the mind]], who, in their stead, prefers the life of [[economic materialism]] and [[conspicuous consumption]] as paramount human activities.

;17th century
Whilst involved in a lawsuit, the writer and poet [[Jonathan Swift]] (1667–1745), in the [[slang]] of his time, described a gruff bailiff as a philistine, someone who is considered a merciless enemy.&lt;ref name="Unabridged 1951"/&gt;

;18th century
The [[polymath]] [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]] (1749–1832) described the philistine personality, by asking:

{{quotation| What is a philistine? A hollow gut, full of fear and hope that God will have mercy!}}

Goethe further described such men and women, by noting that:

{{Quotation|... the Philistine not only ignores all conditions of life which are not his own, but also demands that the rest of mankind should fashion its mode of existence after his own.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}}}

In the [[comedy of manners]] play, ''[[The Rivals]]'' (1775), [[Richard Brinsley Sheridan]] (1751–1816) identifies a violent [[Aristocracy|aristocrat]] as 'that bloodthirsty Philistine, Sir Lucius O'Trigger'.

;19th century
The philosopher [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] (1844–1900) identified the philistine as a person who, for a lack of true unity, could only define [[Style (visual arts)|style]] in the negative.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

;20th century
* In the novel ''Der Ewige Spießer'' (The Eternal Philistine, 1930), the Austro–Hungarian writer [[Ödön von Horváth]] (1901–38) derided the cultural coarseness of the philistine man and his limited view of the world. The eponymous philistine is a failed businessman, a salesman of used cars, who aspires to the [[Conspicuous consumption|high-life]] of wealth; to realise that aspiration, he seeks to meet a rich woman who will support him, and so embarks upon a rail journey from Munich to Barcelona to seek her at the World's Fair.
* In the ''Lectures on Russian Literature'' (1981), in the essay 'Philistines and Philistinism' the writer [[Vladimir Nabokov]] (1899–1977) describes the philistine man and woman as:

{{Quotation|A full-grown person whose interests are of a [[Economic materialism|material]] and commonplace nature, and whose mentality is formed of the stock ideas and [[Convention (norm)|conventional]] ideals of his or her [[Social class|group]] and time. I have said “full-grown” person because the child or the adolescent who may look like a small philistine is only a small parrot mimicking the ways of confirmed vulgarians, and it is easier to be a parrot than to be a white heron. “Vulgarian” is more or less synonymous with “philistine”: the stress in a vulgarian is not so much on the conventionalism of a philistine, as on the vulgarity of some of his conventional notions. I may also use the terms “genteel” and “bourgeois”. Genteel implies the lace-curtain refined vulgarity, which is worse than simple coarseness. To burp in company may be rude, but to say “excuse me” after a burp is genteel, and thus worse than vulgar. The term bourgeois I use following [[Gustave Flaubert|Flaubert]], not [[Karl Marx|Marx]]. Bourgeois, in Flaubert's sense, is a state of mind, not a state of pocket. A bourgeois is a smug philistine, a dignified vulgarian . . . generally speaking, philistinism presupposes a certain advanced state of civilization, where, throughout the ages, certain [[tradition]]s have accumulated in a heap and have started to stink.&lt;ref name="NabokovRussianLit"&gt;Nabokov, ''Lectures on Russian Literature'', essay ''Philistines and Philistinism''&lt;/ref&gt;}}

* In the ''Lectures on Literature'' (1982), in speaking of the novel ''[[Madame Bovary]]'' (1856), about the [[Bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] wife of a country doctor, Nabokov said that philistinism is manifest in the [[Prude|prudish]] attitude demonstrated by the man or the woman who accuses a work of [[art]] of being [[obscene]].&lt;ref&gt;Nabokov, ''Lectures on Literature'', lecture on ''Madame Bovary''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Correggio_058.jpg|thumb|''Portrait of a Man with a Book'']]
'''''Portrait of a Man with a Book''''' is an oil on canvas painting by [[Correggio]], dated to around 1522. It was bequeathed to the [[Pinacoteca del Castello Sforzesco]] in Milan (where it now hangs) in 1945 by Lydia Caprara Morando Attendolo Bolognini. It is sometimes instead attributed to [[Parmigianino]] but majority opinion is that it dates to Correggio's first mature period, which is supported by the fact that it was painted directly on top of the sketch, an informal technique suggesting it was made for a close friend of the artist.

It shows a man in a black coat and black cap three-quarter-length against a wooded background, reading from a tiny book held in his right hand, argued by [[Roberto Longhi]] to be a [[book of hours]]&lt;ref&gt;''Edizione delle opere complete'', Roberto Longhi. Author, Roberto Longhi. Publisher, Sansoni, 1985&lt;/ref&gt; and by others such as Muzzi to be a ''Petrarchino'' (ie a miniature edition of [[Petrarch]]'s ''[[Il Canzoniere]]''). If it is the latter, the bee in the background may refer to poems CXC and CCCXIX of the work.

'''Rani Chandra''' is a fictional character played by [[Anjli Mohindra]] in the British [[children's television|children's]] [[science fiction television]] programme ''[[The Sarah Jane Adventures]]'', a [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] from the long-running series ''[[Doctor Who]]''. She first appeared in ''[[The Day of the Clown]]''.

==Conception==
Rani Chandra was introduced into ''The Sarah Jane Adventures'' as a replacement for departing character [[Maria Jackson]] played by [[Yasmin Paige]]. Paige left the series as a regular due to her wanting to complete her GCSE's, thus, Maria moved to America because her Dad had been offered a job there.&lt;ref name="SFX interview"&gt;{{cite web

Rani shares her name with [[The Rani (Doctor Who)|the Rani]], a recurring villain from the classic series of ''[[Doctor Who]]''.  [[Russell T Davies]] told readers of ''[[Doctor Who Magazine]]'' that Rani is "not ''the'' Rani".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Davies |first=Russell T |authorlink=Russell T Davies |date=15 October 2008 |title=Further Investigation! |journal=[[Doctor Who Magazine]] |issue=400 |pages=53 |publisher=[[Panini Publishing]] |location=[[Tunbridge Wells]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appearances==
Rani Chandra first appears in the second story of series two, replacing the character of [[Maria Jackson]] ([[Yasmin Paige]]). In ''[[The Day of the Clown]]'' (2008), Rani and her parents move into the Jacksons' old house at 12 Bannerman Road&lt;ref&gt;''The Invasion of the Bane''&lt;/ref&gt; (sometimes 36 Bannerman Road&lt;ref&gt;''The Last Sontaran''&lt;/ref&gt;), opposite [[Sarah Jane Smith|Sarah Jane]] ([[Elisabeth Sladen]]) and [[Luke Smith (The Sarah Jane Adventures)|Luke Smith]]'s ([[Tommy Knight]]) house, in [[Ealing]], [[London]].&lt;ref name="SFX interview"/&gt; Her father is the new head teacher of the school where she, Luke and his best friend [[Clyde Langer|Clyde]] ([[Daniel Anthony (actor)|Daniel Anthony]]) are pupils; her mother owns Bloomin' Lovely floral shop. An aspiring journalist, Rani soon joins Sarah Jane's investigative gang.&lt;ref name="SFX interview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Digital Spy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Official website"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sja/sites/mrsmith/noflash/personal_data/?video=rani|title=Rani Chandra|accessdate=2008-09-04|publisher=[[BBC]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130419201230/http://www.bbc.co.uk/cbbc/directories/the-sarah-jane-adventures-characters-and-aliens|archivedate=19 April 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the series three première ''[[Prisoner of the Judoon]]'' (2009), Rani and Clyde are banned by extraterrestrial police force the [[Judoon]] from space travel as punishment for interference in their work.&lt;ref&gt;"[[Prisoner of the Judoon]]" part 2&lt;/ref&gt; Although grounded on her terrestrial homeworld, she is nobility of an unspecified alien planet. A humanoid child monarch known as Gavin creates her Lady Rani in appreciation of her assistance in his succession which also saved the whole of humanity.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Empty Planet]]'' part 2&lt;/ref&gt; Coincidentally, she is continually addressed as Lady Rani in the subsequent serial, when she is transported to the court of [[Lady Jane Grey|Queen Jane]] and mistaken for a newly summoned lady-in-waiting.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Lost in Time (The Sarah Jane Adventures)|Lost in Time]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Series three story ''[[The Mad Woman in the Attic]]'' focuses on Rani. Sarah Jane discovers that, in violation of her rules, Rani has shared her adventures in letters to her former schoolfriend Samuel; the events of the episode cause two timelines to occur, one where in 2059, Rani has acquired the Smith home at 13 Bannerman Road and become miserable and alone, and another where she will have a son and grandchildren and still friends with Luke and even her predecessor, Maria, living with her family at the former Smith home. Rani's final appearance comes in series five, in the last episode of the programme, ''[[The Man Who Never Was (The Sarah Jane Adventures)|The Man Who Never Was]]'' (2011).

==Characterisation==
The official ''The Sarah Jane Adventures'' website offers the following description of Rani Chandra:

{{cquote|''15, inquisitive, smart and sassy. Wants to be a [[journalist]], a sort of junior Sarah Jane, and thus idolises Sarah Jane just a little and in return, Sarah Jane takes her happily on her investigations. Rani enjoys Luke's company because they're both quite bright and eager to learn. However, she's equally fond of [[Clyde Langer|Clyde]] because he's cool and a bit rebellious, and has charm.''
|200|50|-[[CBBC]] ''The Sarah Jane Adventures'' website&lt;ref name="Official website"/&gt;}}

In an interview for ''[[SFX magazine|SFX]]'', Mohindra asserts that Rani and Maria are only similar in the extent that they are both girls, live in the same house and "[i]n personality terms...[they are] both quite strong-willed", although she notes that there are "a lot less tears from Rani than there were from Maria." She describes Rani's relationship with Sarah Jane as "a lot different" to that between Sarah Jane and Maria. Mohindra notes that Rani is "very much an apprentice of Sarah Jane...[although] at first...Sarah Jane is not really that interested in taking on another child." Rani [[Job Shadow|shadows]] Sarah Jane and copies her behaviour to help her deal with a situation. She is keen on [[Psychological warfare|fighting mentally]] as opposed to [[Assault|physically]] and Mohindra likes the fact that Rani is "a girl between two guys at times".&lt;ref name="SFX interview"/&gt;

==Reception==
Reviewing the second series of ''The Sarah Jane Adventures'' for [[Digital Spy]], Ben Rawson-Jones writes that: "As Rani, Anjli Mohindra was fine with dialogue, but painfully self-conscious on a physical acting level when compared to the effortless ease with which [[Daniel Anthony (actor)|Daniel Anthony]] and [[Tommy Knight]] portray Clyde and Luke. It was almost as if someone was stood slightly off set operating her with strings. That theory at least fits into the whole 'body possession' procession of the second season."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/cult/a138218/sarah-jane-season-two-the-cult-spy-verdict.html|title= 'Sarah Jane' Season Two: The Verdict|last=Rawson-Jones|first=Ben|date=14 December 2008|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=2008-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Rani’s first appearance, Michael Bush writes for Den Of Geek: “Rani is another asset to the fledgling cast: a gabby young journalist whose inquisitive nature leads to a run in with alien foes. Comparisons between Rani and Sarah Jane's former companion [[Maria Jackson|Maria]] are almost inevitable, and bound to be divisive, but - based on this episode, at least - Mohindra gives as good as she takes, and her character manages to be interesting and endearing without treading on Miss Jackson's toes.” &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.denofgeek.com/tv/9054/the-sarah-jane-adventures-series-2-episode-3-review|title=The Sarah Jane Adventures series 2 episode 3 review|last=|first=|date=|work=Den of Geek|access-date=2018-02-20|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|publisher=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Regional Arts &amp; Culture Council''' (RACC) is an agency that oversees arts activity throughout the [[Portland metropolitan area]] in [[Oregon]], [[United States]]. It was established as an independent [[501(c)(3)]] [[nonprofit organization]] in 1995, replacing a bureau that had been shared by the City of Portland and [[Multnomah County, Oregon|Multnomah County]] – the Metropolitan Arts Commission. Today, RACC serves the tri-county region of Multnomah, [[Clackamas County, Oregon|Clackamas]], and [[Washington County, Oregon|Washington]] counties.

The mission of the organization is to integrate arts and culture in all aspects of community life through vision, leadership and service. RACC is funded by the [[Government of Portland, Oregon|City of Portland]], Multnomah, Clackamas, Washington counties, [[Metro (Oregon regional government)|Metro]], the [[Oregon Arts Commission]], and several private donors. It provides programs and offers grants to artists and arts organizations throughout the region. RACC also manages the 1.33-percent-for-art program for Multnomah County, and the 2%-for-art program for the City of Portland. The most famous of [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]]'s public artworks is ''[[Portlandia (statue)|Portlandia]]'', which was funded in association with the construction of the [[Portland Building]] in the mid-1980s.

RACC funds a variety of not-for-profit, publicly accessible arts activities in the region.&lt;ref name="RACC_PROG"&gt;

RACC also funds a number of individual artists each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Stabler|first=David|title=Regional Arts &amp; Culture Council gives record $732,440 to 66 groups and 94 artists|url=http://www.oregonlive.com/performance/index.ssf/2012/12/regional_arts_culture_gives_73.html|accessdate=March 24, 2018|newspaper=The Oregonian|date=December 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

RACC provides resources for artists through a comprehensive [http://www.racc.org web site] and several newsletters (both printed and electronic). RACC provides several technical assistance programs, including workshops for artists, and convenes public forums and other meetings to discuss important arts and culture issues in the community. In 2004, RACC launched a workplace giving program for arts and culture – [http://www.workforart.org/ Work for Art] – to raise additional funds for local arts organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Work for Art launches 6th annual campaign|url=http://www.oregonlive.com/argus/index.ssf/2011/09/work_for_art_launches_6th_annu.html|accessdate=March 24, 2018|newspaper=Hillsboro Argus|date=September 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2008 the agency launched a public-private initiative to ensure equitable access to arts education for all K-8 students in the region; this collaboration is known as [http://www.therightbraininitiative.org The Right Brain Initiative].

The executive director of RACC is Eloise Damrosch. Former executive directors have included Bill Bulick, Mike Pippi, and David Hudson. RACC is managed by a Board of Directors of approximately 25 persons, with a staff of approximately 28.&lt;ref name="RACC_SNB"&gt;

==History==
In 1856, [[Massachusetts]] businessman Theodore B. Sheldon moved to Red Wing with his first wife, Mary. Sheldon was very prominent in the small, growing town of Red Wing. He first joined Jesse McIntire and established himself in the mercantile business. Sheldon was involved with numerous other industries in Red Wing, including grain, banks, railroads, stoneware, and gas and power. Most prominently, he and McIntire established Red Wing's First National Bank in 1865. Sheldon also unified the Bluff and Diamond flour mills to establish Red Wing Mills, which have been described as the pride of Red Wing.&lt;ref name=Cartwright&gt;{{cite web |last=Cartwright |first=R.L. |title=T.B. Sheldon Memorial Auditorium, Red Wing |url=http://www.mnopedia.org/structure/tb-sheldon-memorial-auditorium-red-wing |work=MNopedia |publisher=Minnesota Historical Society |date=2013-11-20 |accessdate=2016-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Sheldon died in 1900, his will required that half of his estate be used for a public, nonsectarian purpose in the town of Red Wing. On March 3, 1903, Sheldon's trustees proposed the idea of T.B. Sheldon Memorial Auditorium, and the [[city council]] approved it. Eighteen months later, the new theater stood on the corner of Third Street and East Avenue. It was managed by the city of Red Wing.&lt;ref name=Cartwright /&gt;

The theater opened on October 10, 1904, with a performance of the light comic opera ''The Royal Chef''.  The opening ceremonies also included a performance by the Rossiter Orchestra from [[Minneapolis]].&lt;ref name=Cartwright /&gt;

From the beginning, some feared that the theater would have a demoralizing effect on the town. During opening night, several seats were left vacant in protest. In the 1920s, Red Wing church groups took their concerns to the city council. They petitioned, unsuccessfully, for greater censorship and for Sunday shows to be discontinued.&lt;ref name=Cartwright /&gt;

The theater was originally used for live performances. It primarily showed lighter fare, like musical comedies and romantic dramas. In 1911 the theater began projecting silent movies. After a fire in 1918, the theater was refurbished by the original architecture firm, overseen by [[Lowell Lamoreaux]]. Among the improvements was a movie projection box. The theater re-opened with a viewing of the movie ''[[Tom Sawyer (1917 film)|Tom Sawyer]]'', which signaled its shift away from [[live theater]] and toward film.&lt;ref name=Cartwright /&gt;

During the 1920s and 1930s, the theater became a popular and profitable movie house. Red Wing was fortunate not to suffer considerably during the [[Great Depression]]. In 1929, the theater began showing [[sound movie]]s or "talkies". It was remodeled in 1936 to improve the visuals and acoustics for showing films.&lt;ref name=Cartwright /&gt;

The auditorium began to experience trouble in the 1950s. A nationwide slump in moviegoing slowed its profits, and unwise investments in improvements sunk its funds. The theater was further threatened in 1957, when John Wright brought two lawsuits against it. Wright, the owner of a competing theater, alleged that the city had an unfair advantage over private entrepreneurs. He also filed suit to argue that a movie theater was not "public" and the auditorium was therefore in violation of Sheldon's trust.&lt;ref name=Cartwright /&gt;

In 1958 the [[Minnesota Supreme Court]] ordered the auditorium to quit the movie business. The theater's board found a way around the ruling, however, by leasing the theater to James Fraser. Fraser had been the theater's manager, and he continued to show movies there. In 1960 the Minnesota Supreme Court handed down its final decision, which was unanimously in favor of the auditorium.&lt;ref name=Cartwright /&gt;

Poor management caused continued financial problems for the theater in the 1970s and 1980s. In 1984 the board established a task force to raise money to restore the theater. The restored theater re-opened in 1988. The theater projected its last movie in May 1988, but it continued to host live entertainment. In 2012 the auditorium was offering a range of live programming that included both highbrow and middlebrow events.&lt;ref name=Cartwright /&gt;

In [[folklore]], a '''simpleton''' is a person whose foolish actions are the subject of often-repeated stories. Simpletons are also known as '''noodles''', '''fools''', and '''gothamites'''.  Folklore often holds, with no basis in fact, that certain towns or countries are thought to be home to large numbers of simpletons. The [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]] told tales of stupid populations in [[Abdera, Thrace|Abdera]] and other cities; in [[Germany]], men of [[Schilda]] are conspicuous in these stories; in [[Spain]] hundreds of jokes exist about the supposed foolishness of the people from [[Lepe]]; and in [[England]], the village of [[Gotham, Nottinghamshire|Gotham]] in Nottinghamshire is reputed to be populated by simpletons. In [[Sri Lanka]] whole districts in the central, southern, and western provinces are credited with being the abode of foolish people.&lt;ref name='Noodles'&gt;{{cite book | last = Clouston | first = W. A. | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = The Book of Noodles: Stories of Simpletons; or, Fools and Their Follies | publisher = Elliot Stock | date = 1888 | location = London | pages = | url = http://sacred-texts.com/etc/bon/index.htm | doi = | id = | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Tales of simpleton behavior have often been collected into books, and early joke books include many simpleton jokes. In ancient Greece, [[Philogelos|Hierokles]] created such a collection. In England, the famous ''[[Joe Miller (actor)|Joe Miller's Jests]]'' is highly inclusive of simpleton jokes. In Britain the Irish are often stereotyped as stupid&lt;ref name="Noodles"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Joe Miller's Jests|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/40127/40127-h/40127-h.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Worstall|first=Tim|title=Forbes|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2013/01/03/it-would-have-to-be-the-irish-newspapers-trying-something-insanely-stupid-like-charging-for-links-to-websites/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cantwell|first=Billy|title=Irish Echo|url=http://www.irishecho.com.au/2011/07/17/comment-time-for-the-stupid-irish-joke-to-be-laid-to-rest/11036}}&lt;/ref&gt;   and are the butt of [[An Englishman, an Irishman and a Scotsman]] jokes. Books of simpleton tales exist in [[Persian Empire|Persia]], [[Ireland]], [[Turkey]], [[Iceland]], [[Japan]], [[Sicily]], and [[India]].&lt;ref name="Noodles"/&gt; 

Simpleton tales are huge in number, but many of them share the same notions of simple-minded behavior. Many are repeated, with altered names, settings, characters, etc., in language after language and collection after collection. 

A very old such tale from England is&lt;blockquote&gt;There was a man of Gotham that rode to the market with two bushels of wheat, and because his horse should not be damaged by carrying too great a burden, he was determined to carry the corn himself upon his own neck, and still kept riding upon his horse till he arrived at the end of his journey. Now I will leave you to judge which was the wisest, his horse or himself.&lt;ref name='Gotham'&gt;{{cite book | last = Halliwell | first = James Orchard | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = The Merry Tales of the Wise Men of Gotham | publisher = John Russell Smith | date = 1840 | location = London | pages = | url = http://www.presscom.co.uk/gotham.html | doi = | id = | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A famous one from ancient Greece is&lt;blockquote&gt;A man's father having died, the son dutifully took the body to the embalmers. When he returned at the appointed time to take it, there happened to be a number of bodies in the same place, so he was asked if his father had any peculiarity by which his body might be recognised, and the simpleton replied, "He had a cough."&lt;ref name="Noodles"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''''Sobor on the Blood''''' (''Unity on Blood'') is a Ukrainian [[documentary film]] of 2006. Joint project of Ukrainian TV channel [[1+1 (channel)|1+1]] and Studio [[Teleсon]].

In December, 1991 [[Ukraine]] became an independent state. However the young state, which has been held down with economical difficulties and political fights, could not give sufficient attention to learning its own history. The majority of usual citizens of Ukraine even today know almost nothing about greatness and tragedy of the Ukrainian national-liberation movement, and so any discussion about this theme remains at a level of stereotypes of the Soviet epoch.

The series "Sobor on the Blood" for the first time comprehensively and fairly will tell viewer about the struggle for unity and independence of our country for the period from 1919 to 1949. This struggle is considered in the series as a part of the all-European history. In fact [[Yevhen Konovalets]] and [[Andriy Atanasovych Melnyk|Andriy Melnyk]], [[Stepan Bandera]] and [[Andrey Sheptytsky]], [[Taras Bulba-Borovets]] and [[Roman Shukhevych]] lived and acted in a difficult situation of the grandiose geo-political conflict between Hitlerite [[Reich]], [[Joseph Stalin]] Empire and the western democracies. Such approach allows understanding and comprehending the reasons of events and acts in common to all mankind sense, but not from one or another with stereotypes flushed point of view.

'''''The Berlin Affair''''' ({{lang-it|'''Interno Berlinese'''}}) is a [[1985 in film|1985]] [[Italy|Italo]]-[[Germany|German]] [[film]], directed by [[Liliana Cavani]] and starring [[Gudrun Landgrebe]], [[Kevin McNally]] and [[Mio Takaki]].&lt;ref name="Marrone 255"/&gt; Set in [[Berlin]], 1938, it sees the wife of a rising [[Nazi]] diplomat fall in love with Mitsuko Matsugae, the daughter of the [[Japan]]ese [[ambassador]] and an artist. Her husband finds out, and moves to break up the affair. However he soon falls in love with Mitsuko himself, leading to the intervention of officials higher in the system. The film is based upon the novel ''[[Quicksand (Tanizaki novel)|Quicksand]]'' by [[Jun'ichirō Tanizaki]].

==Plot==
Berlin 1938: Louise von Hollendorf is married to Heinz, a German senior diplomat at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. She decides to take drawing lessons at the institute of Fine Arts. At the institute, Louise meets Mitsuko Matsugae, a young and alluring daughter of the Japanese Ambassador. Captivated by Mitsuko's beauty, Louise asks her to model for her sketching practice. Rumor spreads at the institute that the two women are romantically engaged. Rather than driving them apart the rumors bring the two friends closer together and soon they have a passionate affair. As Louise later confides to her former literature professor, "One moment we were laughing, the next, we were making love". They have their romantic encounters first at Louise's house and later at a seedy hotel. After spending more and more time together Louise falls in love with Mitsuko. 

Her husband, Heinz, grows suspicious of the women's relationship. Heinz becomes not only jealous but also worried that his wife's indiscretions might harm his political ambitions. Heinz confronts Louise, who denies his allegation even in the face of clear evidence.

One day, Louise discovers that Mitsuko has had an affair with Joseph Benno, their half-Italian drawing instructor. Louise learns about Mitsuko and Joseph's plan to marry and that the two have spread the lesbian rumors to distract from their own socially unacceptable, mixed-race relationship. Disgusted and disillusioned, Louise breaks away from Mitsuko and returns to her husband, confessing the full extent of what has happened.

Meanwhile, the Nazi regime starts to eliminate dissidents under the cloak of a morality campaign. Wolf von Hollendorf, Heinz’s cousin and a high-ranking [[Gestapo]] officer, forces Louise and Heinz to participate in a plot, which uncovers General Werner von Heiden's homosexuality. Louise and Heinz are forced to set a trap for von Heiden at their house by inviting the older General and his lover, a young handsome pianist. At the visit, Wolf exposes von Heiden's relationship, ruining the general's career. 

A month later, Mitsuko reappears in Louise’s life, faking being ill and pregnant. Louise does not believe Mitsuko, nevertheless they rekindle their affair with even greater intensity. Benno, who still has a relationship with Mitsuko, promises Louise that he will not interfere with Louise's and Mitsuko's relationship if Louise helps them in getting married. Louise reluctantly agrees. Benno then uses their written agreement to blackmail Heinz who, with Wolf's help, deports Benno. 

Heinz is now determined to separate his wife from her Japanese lover. The two women plan to scare Heinz to accept their relationship by faking an attempted suicide. The plan takes an unexpected turn when Mitsuko seduces Heinz in a ménage à trois. Caught in a love triangle Louise, Mitsuko and Heinz grow more and more jealous of each other. Mitsuko, jealous and possessive, dominates Louise and Heinz. At a dinner, Mitsuko drugs the von Hollendorfs with sleeping pills to prevent them from having sex. Mitsuko uses the ruse to turn Heinz and Louise on each other. By now, their self-destructive relationship becomes publicly known to the Nazi regime as the exiled Benno publishes his account abroad. To avoid the scandal, Heinz is asked to resign and leaves Berlin. Wolf temporarily withdraws their passports. However, rather than leave each other, all three drink poison in a ceremonial rite. 

Upon awakening, and to her bewilderment, Louise discovers that both Heinz and Mitsuko are dead, revealing that she was given a sedative instead of poison, and effectively being left behind and betrayed by both her lovers. She confides in her former professor one last time. He urges her to publish her story before he is arrested by the [[Gestapo]].

The story is based upon [[Jun'ichirō Tanizaki]]'s novel ''[[Quicksand (Tanizaki novel)|Quicksand]]'', or ''Manji'', published serial from 1928-1930. Cavani was drawn to the novel because of its dramatic intensity and extreme economy, his capacity to bring us, as nearly breathless spectators, inside the meaning of seemingly insignificant details.&lt;ref name="Marrone 237"&gt;Marrone, ''The Gaze and the Labyrinth'', p. 237&lt;/ref&gt; ''Manji'' was published as a serial novel in a literary magazine between 1928 and 1930. Sonoko, the first-person narrator, recounts her own story to a prominent writer as a long monologue that continues the novel itself.&lt;ref name="Marrone 237"/&gt; It is the story of a passionate love affair with Mitsuko that eventually involves her husband and Watanuki, an impotent effeminate dandy. Mitsuki was actually the name of Tanizaki's third wife. She inspired several of his novels. Cavani brought the story forward in time and set the plot in Germany in 1938.

''The Berlin Affair'' was the first film produced by [[Menahem Golan]] and [[Yoram Globus]] in Italy for Cannon. It was shot in [[Rome]] at the Paolis Studios and [[Vienna]] from April to July 1985. Gudrun Landgrabe, one of the discoveries of the [[New German Cinema]], had appeared in [[Robert van Ackeren]]'s ''[[A Woman in Flames]]'' 1982, [[Edgar Reitz]]’s [[Heimat]] 1984, and [[István Szabó]]’s [[Colonel Redl]] 1985.&lt;ref name="Marrone 238"&gt;Marrone, ''The Gaze and the Labyrinth'', p. 238&lt;/ref&gt; Kevin McNally, a British actor, plays the husband. Casting the role of Mitzuko was challenging. Cavani went to [[Tokyo]] looking for a model of beauty that could balance seductiveness with an iron will. She found it in the 24-year-old actress and pop singer Mio Takaki.&lt;ref name="Marrone 237"/&gt;

==Release==
It was entered into the [[36th Berlin International Film Festival]].&lt;ref name="Berlinale"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.berlinale.de/en/archiv/jahresarchive/1986/02_programm_1986/02_Programm_1986.html |title=Berlinale: 1986 Programme |accessdate=2011-01-15 |work=berlinale.de}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Berlin Affair '' is available in Region 2 DVD. It has not been released on DVD in the U.S.A.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2898">'''Theatre Tulsa, Inc.''' is a [[community theatre]] company in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]], USA. 

[http://www.theatretulsa.org/ Theatre Tulsa], the longest running community theatre west of the Mississippi and seventh in the nation, has had a prosperous but sometimes difficult history. The theatre has survived multiple wars, fires, and economic depressions.  Theatre Tulsa started as a small community theatre that played shows in a tent, and grew to the largest community theatre in the nation in the 1970s, followed by years of decline and a recent re-invigoration that includes the new creation of a Broadway Series main stage season, a Next Stage series season composed of new works, and a Family Series season for children, families, and arts education programming. 

Tulsa Little Theatre was incorporated December. 10, 1922 by Mrs. Bonnie Reed and Mrs. Hope Holway. Despite the [[Great Depression]], the group managed to raise money to build a theater which was christened with a performance of ''[[The Cradle Song]]'' in February 1932. Two years later, the group incorporated as Tulsa Little Theatre. Struggling through the next few years, the theater survived a threatened bank foreclosure in 1935 after a number of donors stepped in, and in 1940 the theater paid off its mortgage. During [[World War II]], it produced shows for military camps and veterans’ hospitals. Tulsa Little Little Theatre prospered, and by 1959 was the largest non-professional theater company in the country. In 1964, its membership was 8,000 strong. By 1972 it had the largest community theater membership in the nation and had counted 1.5 million members over the past 50 years.  In 1974 Tulsa Little Theatre changed its name to Theatre Tulsa, Inc. Theatre Tulsa remains active today producing 10 productions a year that include modern and classic [[drama]]s, [[comedies]], and [[musical theatre|musicals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.theatretulsa.org/|title=Theatre Tulsa|accessdate=2007-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Theatre Tulsa has had many firsts; it was the first community theater in the country to premiere ''[[Our Town]]'' (1939) and ''[[All My Sons]]'' (1947); the musical ''[[Brownstone (musical)|Brownstone]]''(1985); “Miracle on 34th Street: A Musical Adaptation” (a 1993 original musical written for Theatre Tulsa); “''[[I Love You, You’re Perfect, Now Change]]''” (2003); and the first American production of ''[[Pitmen Painters]]'' (2011). Theatre Tulsa’s production of ''[[Forever Plaid]]'' sold out more than 400 shows in 1995 and 1996. Some noted performers, including [[Jeanne Tripplehorn]], [[Kristin Chenoweth]] and [[Sam Harris]], received their first stage experience with Theatre Tulsa.

==Synopsis==

The documentary follows the story of [[Jon Alpert]]'s 1979 trip with Cuban politician [[Fidel Castro]]. Fidel had granted Alpert permission to accompany him on his plane trip to the [[United Nations]], where he was expected to give a speech as the president of the [[Non-Aligned Movement|non-aligned countries]]. Alpert, a young journalist with experience reporting on Cuban affairs, had expected to use the material for a piece with his employer at the time, NBC, only for the piece to never air, something that Suárez claims was done due to NBC not wanting to show Castro as a charismatic person.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.elperiodico.com/es/noticias/tele/castro-viaje-fidel-5659310|title=Castro, en un 'Viaje con Fidel'|date=2016-11-29|work=El Periódico|access-date=2017-03-06|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Castro allowed Alpert access to both himself and his private rooms during the entirety of his trip, something that he had not previously granted to any journalists from North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.20minutos.es/noticia/2901078/0/tcm-emitira-documental-viaje-con-fidel-por-muerte-dirigente-cubano/|title=TCM emitirá el documental Un viaje con Fidel por la muerte del dirigente cubano|first=|date=|work=20 minutos.es - Últimas Noticias|access-date=2017-03-06|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alpert later stated that he was initially extremely nervous but grew more comfortable around Castro.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.clasesdeperiodismo.com/2016/11/26/mira-completo-el-documental-un-viaje-con-fidel/|title=Mira completo el documental “Un viaje con Fidel”|website=Clases de Periodismo|access-date=2017-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Art and video games}}
The concept of '''video games as a form of art''' is a controversial topic within the [[entertainment industry]]. Though [[video game]]s have been afforded legal protection as creative works by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]], the philosophical proposition that video games are works of [[art]] remains in question, even when considering the contribution of expressive elements such as graphics, storytelling and music. Even [[art game]]s, games purposely designed to be a work of creative expression, have been challenged as works of art by some critics.&lt;ref name="Parker"&gt;{{cite journal| title=An Art World for Artgames| author=Felan Parker| url=http://journals.sfu.ca/loading/index.php/loading/article/view/119| journal=Loading...| volume=7| issue=11| pages= 54–55| year=2013| publisher=[[Simon Fraser University]]| issn=1923-2691}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The earliest institutional consideration of the video game as an art form came in the late 1980s when art museums began retrospective displays of then outdated [[History of video games (first-generation systems)|first]] and [[History of video games (second generation)|second generation]] games. In exhibitions such as the [[Museum of the Moving Image (New York City)|Museum of the Moving Image]]'s 1989 "Hot Circuits: A Video Arcade", video games were showcased as preformed works whose quality as art came from the intent of the curator to display them as art.&lt;ref name=stalker&gt;Stalker, Phillipa Jane. ''[http://wiredspace.wits.ac.za/handle/10539/1749 Gaming In Art: A Case Study Of Two Examples Of The Artistic Appropriation Of Computer Games And The Mapping Of Historical Trajectories Of 'Art Games' Versus Mainstream Computer Games]''. [[University of the Witwatersrand]], Johannesburg. 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Further explorations of this theme were set up in the late 1990s and early 2000s with exhibitions like the [[Walker Art Center]]'s "Beyond Interface" (1998),&lt;ref name=holmes2002&gt;Holmes, Tiffany. ''[http://www.crudeoils.us/artwrite/August2002/Holmes.htm Art games and Breakout: New media meets the American arcade]''. Computer Games and Digital Cultures conference (Tampere, Finland); Art Gallery, [[SIGGRAPH|Siggraph 2002]]. August 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; the online "Cracking the Maze - Game Plug-Ins as Hacker Art" (1999),&lt;ref name=pratt&gt;Pratt, Charles J. ''[http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/27133/The_Art_History_Of_Games_Games_As_Art_May_Be_A_Lost_Cause.php The Art History... Of Games? Games As Art May Be A Lost Cause]''. [[Gamasutra]]. 8 February 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[University of California, Irvine|UCI]] Beall Centre's "Shift-Ctrl" (2000),&lt;ref name=stalker/&gt; and a number of shows in 2001.&lt;ref name=holmes2002/&gt;

The concept of the video game as a [[Marcel Duchamp|Duchamp]]-style [[Readymades of Marcel Duchamp|readymade]] or as [[found object]] resonated with early developers of the [[art game]]. In her 2003 [[Digital Arts and Culture]] paper, "Arcade Classics Span Art? Current Trends in the Art Game Genre", professor Tiffany Holmes noted that a significant emerging trend within the [[digital art]] community was the development of playable video game pieces referencing or paying homage to earlier classic works like ''[[Breakout (video game)|Breakout]]'', ''[[Asteroids (video game)|Asteroids]]'', ''[[Pac-Man]]'', and ''[[Burgertime]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes, Tiffany. ''[http://hypertext.rmit.edu.au/dac/papers/Holmes.pdf Arcade Classics Span Art? Current Trends in the Art Game Genre] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130420092835/http://hypertext.rmit.edu.au/dac/papers/Holmes.pdf |date=April 20, 2013 }}''. [[Digital Arts and Culture|Melbourne DAC 2003]]. 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; In modifying the code of simplistic early games or by creating [[art mod]]s for more complex games like ''[[Quake (video game)|Quake]]'', the art game genre emerged from the intersection of commercial games and contemporary digital art.&lt;ref name=stalker/&gt;

At the 2010 Art History of Games conference in Atlanta, Georgia, professor [[Celia Pearce]] further noted that alongside Duchamp's art productions, the [[Fluxus]] movement of the 1960s, and most immediately the [[New Games|New Games Movement]] had paved the way for more modern "art games". Works such as Lantz' ''[[Pac-Manhattan|Pac Manhattan]]'', according to Pearce, have become something like performance art pieces.&lt;ref name=pratt/&gt; Most recently, a strong overlap has developed between art games and [[indie game]]s. This meeting of the art game movement and the indie game movement is important according to Professor Pearce, insofar as it brings art games to more eyes and allows for greater potential to explore in indie games.&lt;ref name=pratt/&gt;

In March 2006, the French [[Minister of Culture (France)|Minister of Culture]] first characterized video games as cultural goods and as "a form of artistic expression," granting the industry a tax subsidy&lt;ref&gt;Crampton, Thomas. ''[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/06/business/worldbusiness/06game.html For France, Video Games Are as Artful as Cinema]''. [[New York Times]]. 2 November 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; and inducting two French game designers ([[Michel Ancel]], [[Frédérick Raynal]]) and one Japanese game designer ([[Shigeru Miyamoto]]) into the [[Ordre des Arts et des Lettres]]. In May 2011, the United States [[National Endowment for the Arts]], in accepting grants for art projects for 2012, expanded the allowable projects to include "interactive games", furthering the recognition of video games as an art form.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/109835-Games-Now-Legally-Considered-an-Art-Form-in-the-USA | title= Games Now Legally Considered an Art Form (in the USA) | first = John | last = Funk | date = 2011-05-06 | accessdate = 2011-05-06 | publisher = [[Escapist (magazine)|Escapist]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the [[United States Supreme Court]] ruled that video games were protected speech like other forms of art in the June 2011 decision for ''[[Brown v. Entertainment Merchants Association]]''. In Germany, prior to August 2018, the [[Unterhaltungssoftware Selbstkontrolle]] (USK) software ratings body enforced [[Strafgesetzbuch section 86a|''Strafgesetzbuch'' (German code) section 86a]] as outlined by the German government, which banned the sale of games that contained imagery of extremist groups such as Nazis; while Section 86a allowed for use of these images in artistic and scientific works, video games were not seen to fall within an artistic use. On August 9, 2018, the German government agreed to recognize some of the artistic nature of video games and softened the restriction on Section 86a, allowing the USK to consider games with such imagery as long as they fell within the social adequacy clause of Section 86a.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2018-08-09-germany-relaxes-stance-on-nazi-symbols-in-video-games | title= Germany relaxes stance on Nazi symbols in video games | first = Matthew | last = Handrahan | date = August 9, 2018 | accessdate = August 9, 2018 | work = [[GamesIndustry.biz]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ars tech ban"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/08/german-ratings-board-starts-allowing-nazi-symbols-in-video-games/ | title = Germany says games with Nazi symbols can get “artistic” exception to ban | first=  Kyle | last= Orland | date = August 10, 2018 | accessdate = August 10, 2018 | work = [[Ars Technica]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=dd44ce45-d5cf-4189-a1b6-7bcc7e31605f | title = German Attorney General: Video game with Swastika does not violate the law; constitutes art | first=  Baker | last=McKinsey | date = May 8, 2018 | accessdate = August 10, 2018 | work = [[Lexology]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lines between video games and art become blurred when exhibitions fit the labels of both [[game]] and [[interactive art]]. The [[Smithsonian American Art Museum]] held an exhibit in 2012, entitled "[[The Art of Video Games]]", which was designed to demonstrate the artistic nature of video games, including the impact of older works and the subsequent influence of video games on creative culture.&lt;ref name="smithsonian exhibit"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.americanart.si.edu/exhibitions/archive/2012/games/ | title = Exhibitions: The Art of Video Games | publisher = [[Smithsonian American Art Museum]] | accessdate = 2011-02-16 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110806051435/http://americanart.si.edu/exhibitions/archive/2012/games/ | archive-date = 2011-08-06 | dead-url = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Smithsonian later added ''Flower'' and ''[[Halo 2600]]'', games from this collection, as permanent exhibits within the museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.polygon.com/2013/12/17/5222078/smithsonian-acquires-flower-halo-2600-for-its-permanent-collection | title = Smithsonian acquires Flower, Halo 2600 for its permanent collection | publisher = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] | first = Michael | last = McWhertor | date = 2013-12-17 | accessdate = 2013-12-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York City [[List of video games in the Museum of Modern Art|aims to collect]] forty historically important video games in their original format to exhibit, showcasing video game interaction design as part of a broader effort to "celebrate gaming as an artistic medium".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = https://www.wired.com/gamelife/2012/11/moma-videogames/ | title = MoMA to Exhibit Videogames, From Pong to Minecraft | first = Olivia | last = Solon | work = [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] | date  = 2012-11-29 | accessdate = 2012-11-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The annual "[[Into the Pixel]]" art exhibit held at the time of the [[Electronic Entertainment Expo]] highlights [[video game art]] selected by a panel of both video game and art industry professionals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/13/arts/video-games/pixels-floating-on-the-art-worlds-margins.html | title = Pixels Floating on the Art World’s Margins | first = Harold | last=  Goldberg | date = 2013-06-12 | accessdate = 2013-06-15 | work = [[New York Times]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Empathy games===
{{anchor|Empathy game}}
While many video games are recognized as art for their visual imagery and storytelling, another class of games has gained attention for creating an emotional experience for the player, generally by having the user role-play as a character under a stress-inducing situation, covering topics associated with poverty, sexuality, and physical and mental illnesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.polygon.com/2013/5/9/4313246/gamings-new-frontier-cancer-depression-suicide | title = Gaming's New Frontier: Cancer, Depression, Suicide | first = Colin | last =Campbell | date = May 9, 2013 | accessdate = November 15, 2016 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324769704579010641205335768 | title = Videogames About Alcoholism, Depression and Cancer | first = Conon | last = Dougherty | date = August 15, 2013 | accessdate = November 15, 2016 | work = [[Wall Street Journal]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such games are considered to be examples of an empathy game, loosely described by Patrick Begley of the ''[[Sydney Morning Herald]]'' as a game that "asks players to inhabit their character's emotional worlds".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.smh.com.au/digital-life/games/empathy-gaming-focuses-on-emotions-and-moral-decisions-20140904-10ch4z.html | title = 'Empathy gaming' focuses on emotions and moral decisions | first = Patrick | last = Begley | date = November 1, 2014 | accessdate = November 15, 2016 | work = [[Sydney Morning Herald]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
The characterization of games as works of art has been controversial. While recognizing that games may contain artistic elements in their traditional forms such as graphic art, music, and story, several notable figures have advanced the position that games are not artworks, and may never be capable of being called art.

===Legal status===
American courts first began examining the question of whether video games were entitled to constitutional guarantees of [[Freedom of speech|free speech]] as under the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]], in March 1982 in the case of ''America's Best Family Showplace Corp. v. City of New York, Dept. of Bldgs.''&lt;ref&gt;''America's Best Family Showplace Corp. v. City of New York, Dept. of Bldgs.'', 536 F.Supp. 170, D.C.N.Y., 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; In a brace of similarly decided lawsuits in 1982 and 1983, [[precedent]] began to be established for finding that video games were no more expressive than pinball, chess, board- or card-games, or organized sports. This began to change in 2000 as some courts began to make rulings in distinction and carving out narrow exceptions for some ''elements'' of video games.&lt;ref&gt;''American Amusement Mach. Ass'n v. Kendrick'', 115 F.Supp.2d 943 (S.D.Ind.2000).&lt;/ref&gt;

By April 2002, controversy over the topic was still a legal reality as Judge [[Stephen N. Limbaugh, Sr.]], upon reviewing gameplay from "'[[Resident Evil (1996 video game)|The Resident of Evil Creek]]'{{sic}}, '[[Mortal Combat]]'{{sic}}, '[[Doom (1993 video game)|DOOM]],' and '[[Fear Effect]]'" ruled in ''Interactive Digital Software Association v. St. Louis County'' that "just like [[Bingo (U.S.)|bingo]], the Court fails to see how video games express ideas, impressions, feelings, or information unrelated to the game itself".&lt;ref&gt;''Interactive Digital Software Ass'n v. St. Louis County, Mo.'', 200 F.Supp.2d 1126, E.D.Mo.,2002.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wagner, James. "[http://www.salon.com/2002/05/06/games_as_speech/ Playing games with free speech]". ''Salon''. 6 May 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011's ''[[Brown v. Entertainment Merchants Ass'n|Brown v. Entertainment Merchants Association]]'' the United States Supreme Court ruled that games are entitled to First Amendment protection, with the majority opinion reading, "Like the protected books, plays, and movies that preceded them, video games communicate ideas—and even social messages—through many familiar literary devices (such as characters, dialogue, plot, and music) and through features distinctive to the medium (such as the player's interaction with the virtual world). That suffices to confer First Amendment protection."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/TECH/gaming.gadgets/06/27/supreme.court.video.game.art/|work=CNN|last=Sutter|first=John D.|title=Supreme Court sees video games as art}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theory of legitimation===
Emerging art forms depend upon existing communities for recognition and legitimation, even as they compete with those incumbents for ideological and material support.&lt;ref name="Parker"/&gt; Games have faced suspicion from critics of established media, just as film, television, and comics were once doubted.&lt;ref name="Parker"/&gt; Keith Stewart, games editor for ''[[The Guardian]]'', sees mainstream media as preferring to approach games from the angle of the human stories surrounding them – making indie games with identifiable creators attractive to journalists.&lt;ref name="bizStewart"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2013-03-13-the-first-guardian-keith-stuart-on-getting-games-into-culture|work=gamesindustry.biz|last=Pearson|first=Dan|title=The First Guardian: Keith Stuart on getting games into Culture}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critical communities devoted to games have likewise embraced [[auteur theory]] of games' artistic potential as underpinned by the creative visions of sole creators.&lt;ref name="Parker"/&gt; John Lanchester of the ''[[London Review of Books]]'' noted that even as video games become a larger market by revenues compared to films and books, the amount of attention given to video games is generally delegated to a limited set of sources and do not readily enter the "cultural discourse".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= John |first=Lanchester |date=January 1, 2009 |title=Is It Art? |url= http://www.lrb.co.uk/v31/n01/john-lanchester/is-it-art  |journal= [[London Review of Books]] |publisher=Nicholas Spice |volume=31 |issue=1 |pages=18–20 |doi= |access-date= October 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Auteur theory has led to some overlap between indie status and artistic cachet, with critics praising stylistic choices in indie games, when those same choices would be deplored in a commercial game.&lt;ref name="ibtimesArtGames"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/why-games-matter-indie-movie-fez-meat-427544|work=International Business Times|last=Smith|first=Edward|title=Indie Games Aren't Art Games}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than defending the medium as a whole, proponents of [[art game]]s attempt to create a separate milieu opposed to video games they accept to be [[low culture]].&lt;ref name="Parker"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ibtimesArtGames"/&gt; In practice, indie auteurs often receive commercial backing, while mainstream creators such as Shigeru Miyamoto and Peter Molyneux are increasingly viewed as auteurs as well.&lt;ref name="Parker"/&gt; The conflation of indieness and artistry has been criticized by some, including [[Anna Anthropy]],&lt;ref name="Parker"/&gt; [[Lucy Kellaway]],&lt;ref name="ibtimesArtGames"/&gt; and [[Jim Munroe]],&lt;ref name="sparkMunroe"/&gt; who argue the characteristics that distinguish indie games from the mainstream are not inherently artistic.

Munroe suggested that video games often face a double standard in that if they conform to traditional notions of the game as a toy for children then they are flippantly dismissed as trivial and non-artistic, but if they push the envelope by introducing serious adult themes into games then they face negative criticism and controversy for failing to conform to the very standards of non-artistic triviality demanded by these traditional notions. He further explained games as a type of art more akin to architecture, in which the artist creates a space for the audience to experience on their own terms, than to a non-interactive presentation as in cinema.&lt;ref name="sparkMunroe"&gt;Young, Nora &amp; Misener, Dan. ''[http://www.cbc.ca/spark/2011/10/repeat-of-spark-126-october-16-19-2011 Repeat of Spark 126 – October 16 &amp; 19, 2011: Games as Art]'' (Podcast available: [http://podcast.cbc.ca/spark/plus-spark_20101107_spark126c.mp3 Games as Art] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141029074320/http://podcast.cbc.ca/spark/plus-spark_20101107_spark126c.mp3 |date=October 29, 2014 }}). ''[[Spark (radio show)|Spark]]''. 7 November 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Video game designer [[Kim Swift]] believes games can be artistic but denies that they need to be art in order to have cultural value. She feels video games should aspire to be toys through which adults can exercise their imaginations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/2012/06/kim-swift-interview/|work=WIRED|last=Rigney|first=Ryan|title=Portal Designer Kim Swift Won't Let You Take Her Toys Away}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Roger Ebert on video games as art===
The question rose to wide public attention in the mid-2000s when film critic [[Roger Ebert]] participated in a series of controversial debates and published colloquies. In 2005, following an online discussion concerning whether or not knowledge of the game ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'' was essential to a proper appreciation of the film ''[[Doom (film)|Doom]]'' (which Ebert had awarded one star) as a commentary on the game,&lt;ref name=moriarty&gt;Moriarty, Brian; Caoili, Eric (ed.). ''[http://www.gamesetwatch.com/2011/03/opinion_brian_moriartys_apolog.php Opinion: Brian Moriarty's Apology For Roger Ebert]''. [[GameSetWatch]]. 15 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Ebert described video games as a non-artistic medium incomparable to the more established art forms:

{{quote|text=To my knowledge, no one in or out of the field has ever been able to cite a game worthy of comparison with the great dramatists, poets, filmmakers, novelists and composers. That a game can aspire to artistic importance as a visual experience, I accept. But for most gamers, video games represent a loss of those precious hours we have available to make ourselves more cultured, civilized and empathetic.|sign=[[Roger Ebert]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.rogerebert.com/answer-man/why-did-the-chicken-cross-the-genders | title = Why did the chicken cross the genders? | date = 2005-11-27 | accessdate = 2010-08-31 | work =[[Chicago Sun-Times]] | first = Roger | last = Ebert }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 2006, Ebert took part in a panel discussion at the [[Conference on World Affairs]] entitled "An Epic Debate: Are Video Games an Art Form?" in which he stated that video games don't explore the meaning of being human as other art forms do.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url  = http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060418/SCANNERS/60418001 | title = Video games: The 'epic debate' | first  =Jim | last =Emerson | date = 2006-04-16 | accessdate =2010-08-31 | work = [[Chicago Sun-Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference | title = An Epic Debate: Are Video Games an Art Form? | conference = 62nd Annual Conference on World Affairs | conferenceurl = http://www.colorado.edu/cwa/search_results.html?date=7&amp;year=2006 | date = 2006-04-13 | accessdate = 2010-08-31 | first = Roger | last = Ebert }}&lt;/ref&gt; A year later, in response to comments from [[Clive Barker]] on the panel discussion, Ebert further noted that video games present a malleability that would otherwise ruin other forms of art. As an example, Ebert posed the idea of a version of ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' that would allow for an optional happy ending. Such an option, according to Ebert, would weaken the artistic expression of the original work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070721/COMMENTARY/70721001 | title=  Games vs. Art: Ebert vs. Barker  | date = 2007-07-21 | accessdate = 2010-08-31 | first = Roger | last = Ebert | work = [[Chicago Sun-Times]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In April 2010, Ebert published an essay, dissecting a presentation made by [[Kellee Santiago]] of [[thatgamecompany]] at the 2009 [[TED (conference)|Technology Entertainment Design Conference]], where he again claimed that games can never be art, due to their rules and goal-based interactivity.&lt;ref name="ebert gamesart"&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://blogs.suntimes.com/ebert/2010/04/video_games_can_never_be_art.html | title = Video games can never be art | work = [[Chicago Sun-Times]] | first = Roger | last = Ebert | date = 2010-04-16 | accessdate = 2010-08-31 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20111010001841/http://blogs.suntimes.com/ebert/2010/04/video_games_can_never_be_art.html | archive-date = 2011-10-10 | dead-url = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|text=One obvious difference between art and games is that you can win a game. It has rules, points, objectives, and an outcome.

Ebert's essay was strongly criticized by the gaming community,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.fastcompany.com/1621426/game-designer-kellee-santiago-responds-to-roger-eberts-video-games-are-not-art-rant | title= Game Designer Kellee Santiago Responds to Roger Ebert's "Video Games Are Not Art" Rant  | first = Dan | last = Nosowitz | date = 2010-04-20 | accessdate =2010-08-31 | publisher = [[Fast Company (magazine)|Fast Company]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.wired.com/underwire/2010/04/alt-text-videogames-as-art/ | title = Alt Text: Are Videogames Art?

Although Ebert did not engage with the issue again and his view remains mired in controversy, the notion that video games are ineligible to be considered [[fine art]] due to their commercial appeal and structure as choice-driven narratives has proved persuasive for many including video game luminary [[Brian Moriarty]] who in March 2011 gave a lecture on the topic entitled ''An [[Apologetics|Apology]] For Roger Ebert''.&lt;ref name=moriarty/&gt; In this lecture Moriarty emphasized that video games are merely an extension of traditional rule-based games and that there has been no call to declare games like [[Chess]] and [[Go (game)|Go]] to be art. He went on to argue that art in the sense that [[Romanticism|Romantics]] like Ebert, [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]], and he were concerned with (i.e. fine art or sublime art) is exceptionally rare and that Ebert was being consistent by declaring video games to be without artistic merit inasmuch as Ebert had previously claimed that "Hardly any movies are art."&lt;ref name=moriarty/&gt; Moriarty decried the modern expansion of the definition of "art" to include [[low art]], comparing video games to [[kitsch]] and describing aesthetic appreciation of video games as [[Camp (style)|camp]]. After addressing the corrupting influence of commercial forces in [[indie games]] and the difficulty of setting out to create art given the "slippery" tools that game designers must work with, Moriarty concluded that ultimately it was the fact that player choices were presented in games that structurally invalidated the application of the term "art" to video games as the audience's interaction with the work wrests control from the author and thereby negates the expression of art.&lt;ref name=moriarty/&gt; This lecture was in turn criticized sharply by noted video game designer, [[Zach Gage]].&lt;ref name=moriarty/&gt;

===Other notable critics===
In a 2006 interview with ''[[Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine|US Official PlayStation 2 Magazine]]'', game designer [[Hideo Kojima]] agreed with Ebert's assessment that video games are not art. Kojima acknowledged that games may contain artwork, but he stressed the intrinsically popular nature of video games in contrast to the niche interests served by art. Since the highest ideal of all video games is to achieve 100% player satisfaction whereas art is targeted to at least one person, Kojima argued that video game creation is more of a service than an artistic endeavor.&lt;ref&gt;Gibson, Ellie. ''[http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/news240106kojimaart Games aren't art, says Kojima]''. Eurogamer. 24 January 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the 2010 Art History of Games conference, Michael Samyn and Auriea Harvey (founding members of indie studio [[Tale of Tales (developer)|Tale of Tales]]), argued in no uncertain terms that games "are not art" and that they are by and large "a waste of time." Central to Tale of Tales' distinction between games and art is the purposive nature of games as opposed to art: Whereas humans possess a biological need that is only satisfied by [[Play (activity)|play]], argues Samyn, and as play has manifested itself in the form of [[game]]s, games represent nothing more than a physiological necessity. Art, on the other hand, is not created out of a physical need but rather it represents a search for higher purposes. Thus the fact that a game acts to fulfill the physical needs of the player is sufficient, according to Samyn, to disqualify it as art.&lt;ref name=pratt/&gt;

Gamers were surprised by this controversial stance due to the frequency of prior third-party characterizations of Tale of Tales' productions as "art games," however Tale of Tales clarified that the games they were making simply expanded the conception of games. The characterization of their games as "art games," noted Samyn, was merely a byproduct of the imaginative stagnation and lack of progressivism in the video game industry. While Tale of Tales acknowledged that old media featuring one-way communication was not enough, and that two-way communication via computers offers the way forward for art, the studio argued that such communication today is being held hostage by the [[video game industry]].&lt;ref name=pratt/&gt; To enable and foment this futuristic two-way art, suggests Tale of Tales, the concept of "the game" must be eviscerated by games that do not fit within the current paradigm and then "life must be breathed into the carcass" through the creation of artworks Samyn and Harvey refer to as "not games."&lt;ref name=pratt/&gt;

In 2011, Samyn further refined his argument that games are not art by emphasizing the fact that games are systematic and rule-based. Samyn identified an industry emphasis on [[gameplay mechanics]] as directly responsible for the marginalization of artistic narrative in games and he described modern video games as little more than digital sport. Pointing to systemic problems, Samyn criticized the current model whereby the putative artist must work through a large and highly efficient [[Video game development|development team]] who may not share the artist's vision. However, Samyn does not reject the idea that games, as a medium, can be used to create art. To create art using the medium of the video game Samyn suggests that the artistic message must precede the means of its expression in the guidance of gameplay mechanics, the development of "[[fun]]ness" or economic considerations must cease to guide the work's creation, and the development process must embrace a model wherein a single artist-author's vision gains central primacy.&lt;ref&gt;Samyn, Michael. ''[http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/issues/issue_291/8608-Almost-Art Almost Art]''. [[The Escapist (magazine)|Escapist]]. 1 February 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, ''[[The Guardian|Guardian]]'' art critic [[Jonathan Jones (journalist)|Jonathan Jones]] published an article arguing that games are more like a playground and not art. Jones also notes that the nature of creating video games robs "one person’s reaction to life" and that "no one owns the game, so there is no artist, and therefore no work of art."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2012/nov/30/moma-video-games-art|title=Sorry MoMA, video games are not art|last=Jones|first=Jonathan|date=2012-11-30|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|access-date=2016-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, video game journalist Patricia Hernandez described a [[Puzzle video game|puzzle]] in the [[interactive fiction]] game ''[[Photopia]]''. The solution of the puzzle involves a [[Reveal (narrative)|reveal]] regarding the player's controlled [[Player character|playable character]], prompting experiences which Hernandez argues could not be made "as powerful as they are" in any other art form without interactivity. Hernandez says that narrations in the interactive medium happen in the [[First-person narrative|first person]] and the [[present tense]], which are "fundamental (and often misunderstood) elements of the interactive medium".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://nightmaremode.thegamerstrust.com/2013/01/19/a-moment-of-perfect-beauty/|title=A Moment of Perfect Beauty|date=2013-01-19|work=Nightmare Mode [Archived]|access-date=2017-10-03|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Washington Square Players''' was a [[Manhattan, New York City]] theatrical production company that existed from 1914 to 1918. 

==Biography==
It was founded in 1914.  Its debut production in 1915 was a collection of one-act plays, some of which had been  written for the event. In 1916 the troupe started presenting full-length plays, among which were [[George Bernard Shaw|Shaw]]'s ''[[Mrs Warren's Profession]]'' and translations of [[Anton Chekhov|Chekhov]]'s ''[[The Seagull]]'' and [[Henrik Ibsen|Ibsen]]'s ''[[Ghosts (play)|Ghosts]]''. That same year it moved into the Comedy Theatre, where it subsequently performed [[Eugene O'Neill]]'s one-act play ''[[Eugene O'Neill#One-act plays|In the Zone]]'' in 1917.  In 1918 the company produced [[Elmer Rice]]'s ''[[Elmer Rice#Works|The Home of the Free]]''.  In the same year, the Washington Square Players disbanded, but its work served as the roots for the foundation of the [[Theatre Guild]] in 1919.

[[Katharine Cornell]] is one of its most famous members.

[[File:Brooklyn Museum - Monk Testing Wine - Antonio Casanova y Estorach.jpg|thumb|''Monk Testing Wine'' by [[:es:Antonio Casanova y Estorach|Antonio Casanova y Estorach]] (c.1886)]]
'''Wine tasting''' is the sensory examination and evaluation of [[wine]]. While the practice of wine tasting is as ancient as its production, a more formalized methodology has slowly become established from the 14th century onwards. Modern, professional wine tasters (such as [[sommelier]]s or buyers for [[retailer]]s) use a constantly evolving specialized terminology which is used to describe the range of perceived flavors, aromas and general characteristics of a wine. More informal, recreational tasting may use similar terminology, usually involving a much less analytical process for a more general, personal appreciation.&lt;ref&gt;Peynaud, Émile (1996) [https://books.google.com/books?id=nzehk2Vu5K8C&amp;pg=PA151&amp;dq=wine+tasting+aims&amp;ei=_9nIRvLrCJSS7QKiu9zfDw&amp;sig=LmyRAwE8FKHf-N4Bz3rOWXEkGsY#PPA2,M1  ''The Taste of Wine: The Art and Science of Wine Appreciation'', London: Macdonald Orbis, p1]&lt;/ref&gt;

Results contradicting the reliability of wine tasting in both experts and consumers have surfaced through scientific [[blind wine tasting]], such as inconsistency in identifying wines based on region and price.&lt;ref&gt;Hodgson, Robert T., [http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=8545711 "How Expert are "Expert" Wine Judges?"], ''Journal of Wine Economics'', Vol. 4; Issue 02 (Winter 2009), pp. 233–241.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The [[Sumer|Sumerian]] stories of [[Gilgamesh]] in the 3rd millennium BCE differentiate the popular beers of [[Mesopotamia]], as well as wines from [[Zagros Mountains]] or [[Lebanon]].&lt;ref&gt;Émile Peynaud, '' The taste of wine '', p.1 Dunod, 2013 [https://books.google.fr/books?id=Wfb7AAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA1&amp;dq=le%20gout%20du%20vin%20peynaud&amp;hl=en&amp;pg=PA1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Google books link]&lt;/ref&gt; In the fourth century BCE, [[Plato]] listed the main flavors of wine, and classified the aromas as "species", or families.

[[Aristotle]] proposed a sensory tasting defined by the [[four elements]] (air, water, fire, and earth) further deepened by the Roman noblewoman [[Lucretia]] in the first century BCE.

Although the practice of tasting is as old as the history of wine, the term "tasting" first appeared in 1519.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Tasting: Definition and etymology | url=http://www.cnrtl.fr/definition/degustation | website=cnrtl.fr | date = | accessdate=2016-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The methodology of wine tasting was formalized by the 18th century when [[Linnaeus]], Poncelet, and others brought an understanding of tasting up to date.

In 2004, [[Richard Axel]] and [[Linda B. Buck]], won the Nobel Prize in Medicine for their contribution to the knowledge of the senses of taste and smell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Cell |date=1991 Apr 5 |volume=65 |issue=1 |pages=175-87 |pmid=1840504}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tasting stages==
[[File:Porto.Grahams02.jpg|thumb|right|Ready tasting room of [[port wine]] in a [[wine cellar]] of a producer]]
The results of the four recognized stages to wine tasting:
* appearance
* "in glass" the [[aroma of the wine]]
* "in mouth" sensations
* "finish" ([[aftertaste]])&lt;ref&gt;Ronald S. Jackson, [https://books.google.com/books?id=n0z8XCvAS9EC&amp;pg=PA188&amp;dq=wine+tasting+aims&amp;ei=md3IRrebI5SE7AKk6tzfDw&amp;sig=_ynh2E9B7eRT7ta9AbrpOL5qpaE#PPA2,M1 ''Wine Tasting: A Professional Handbook'', pp 2–3]&lt;/ref&gt;
– are combined in order to establish the following properties of a wine: 
* complexity and character
* potential (suitability for [[aging (wine)|aging]] or drinking)
* possible [[Wine fault|faults]]
A wine's overall quality assessment, based on this examination, follows further careful description and comparison with recognized standards, both with respect to other wines in its price range and according to known factors pertaining to the region or vintage; if it is typical of the region or diverges in style; if it uses certain [[wine-making]] techniques, such as barrel [[fermentation (wine)|fermentation]] or [[malolactic fermentation]], or any other remarkable or unusual characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;Peynaud, Émile (1996) [https://books.google.com/books?id=nzehk2Vu5K8C&amp;pg=PA151&amp;dq=wine+tasting+aims&amp;ei=_9nIRvLrCJSS7QKiu9zfDw&amp;sig=LmyRAwE8FKHf-N4Bz3rOWXEkGsY#PPA2,M1  ''The Taste of Wine: The Art and Science of Wine Appreciation'', London: Macdonald Orbis, p2]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:NorCal2018 Castello di Amorosa Wine Tasting Napa Valley S0151015.jpg|thumb|Wine tasting at [[Castello di Amorosa]], Napa Valley]]

Whereas wines are regularly tasted in isolation, a wine's quality assessment is more objective when performed alongside several other wines, in what are known as tasting "flights". Wines may be deliberately selected for their [[vintage]] ("horizontal" tasting) or proceed from a single [[winery]] ("vertical" tasting), to better compare [[vineyard]] and vintages, respectively. Alternatively, in order to promote an unbiased analysis, bottles and even glasses may be disguised in a "blind" tasting, to rule out any prejudicial awareness of either vintage or winery.

==Blind tasting==
{{Main|Blind wine tasting}}
To ensure impartial judgment of a wine, it should be served ''blind'' – that is, without the taster(s) having seen the label or bottle shape. Blind tasting may also involve serving the wine from a black wine glass to mask the [[wine color|color]] of the wine. A taster's judgment can be prejudiced by knowing details of a wine, such as geographic origin, price, reputation, color, or other considerations.

Scientific research has long demonstrated the [[Placebo|power of suggestion in perception]] as well as the strong effects of expectancies. For example, people expect more expensive wine to have more desirable characteristics than less expensive wine. When given wine that they are falsely told is expensive they virtually always report it as tasting better than the very same wine when they are told that it is inexpensive.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070928231853/http://www.academie-amorim.com/us/laureat_2001/brochet.pdf Chemical Object Representation in the Field of Consciousness – Frédéric Brochet]&lt;/ref&gt; French researcher Frédéric Brochet "submitted a mid-range Bordeaux in two different bottles, one labeled as a cheap table wine, the other bearing a grand cru etiquette." Tasters described the supposed grand cru as "woody, complex, and round" and the supposed cheap wine as  "short, light, and faulty."

Similarly, people have expectations about wines because of their [[List of wine producing regions|geographic origin]], [[winery|producer]], vintage, color, and many other factors. For example, when Brochet served a white wine he received all the usual descriptions: "fresh, dry, honeyed, lively." Later he served the same wine dyed red and received the usual red terms: "intense, spicy, supple, deep."&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070930210308/http://www.seattleweekly.com/2002-02-20/news/wine-snob-scandal.php Wine Snob Scandal – Brochet's work on dyed wine]&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most famous instances of blind testing is known as the [[Judgment of Paris (wine)|Judgment of Paris]], a [[wine competition]] held in 1976 where French judges blind-tested wines from [[France]] and [[California]]. Against all expectations, [[California wines]] bested [[French wines]] according to the judges, a result which would have been unlikely in a non-blind contest. This event was depicted in the 2008 movie ''[[Bottle Shock]]''.

===Price bias===
Another well-publicized double-blind taste test was conducted in 2011 by [[Richard Wiseman|Prof. Richard Wiseman]] of the [[University of Hertfordshire]].  In a wine tasting experiment using 400 participants, Wiseman found that general members of the public were unable to distinguish expensive wines from inexpensive ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Georgiou | first = Maroulla | title = Expensive and inexpensive wines taste the same, research shows | publisher = [[Phys.Org]] | date = Apr 15, 2011 | url = http://phys.org/news/2011-04-expensive-inexpensive-wines.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  "People just could not tell the difference between cheap and expensive wine".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Sample | first = Ian | title = Expensive wine and cheap plonk taste the same to most people | publisher = The Guardian | date = April 14, 2011 | url = https://www.theguardian.com/science/2011/apr/14/expensive-wine-cheap-plonk-taste?INTCMP=ILCNETTXT3487}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Color bias===
In 2001, the [[University of Bordeaux]] asked 54 undergraduate students to test two glasses of wine: one red, one white. The participants described the red as "jammy" and commented on its crushed red fruit.  The participants failed to recognize that both wines were from the same bottle.  The only difference was that one had been colored red with a flavorless dye.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/jun/23/wine-tasting-junk-science-analysis Wine-tasting: it's junk science; The Guardian; June 22, 2013.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ac.els-cdn.com/S0093934X01924939/1-s2.0-S0093934X01924939-main.pdf?_tid=c6c9ffa6-bc7a-11e5-ae11-00000aacb35f&amp;acdnat=1452967301_69c3ad144ba81882e1b68bbb498d79d2 The Colour of Odors; Morrot, Brochet and Dubourdeiu; 28 August 2001]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
===Geographic origin bias===
For 6 years, [[Texas A&amp;M University]] invited people to taste wines labeled "France", "California", "Texas", and while nearly all ranked the French as best, in fact, all three were the same Texan wine.  The contest is built on the simple theory that if people do not know what they are drinking, they award points differently than if they do know what they are drinking.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.austinchronicle.com/food/2005-04-08/265667/ Liquid Assets - A fair competition; The Austin Chronicle; April 8, 2005.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vertical and horizontal tasting==
'''Vertical and horizontal wine tastings''' are wine tasting events that are arranged to highlight differences between similar wines.
* In a '''vertical tasting''', different vintages of the same [[Wine#Wine styles|wine type]] from the same winery are tasted. This emphasizes differences between various vintages.
* In a '''horizontal tasting''', the wines are all from the same vintage but are from different wineries. Keeping wine variety or type and [[List of wine producing regions|wine region]] the same helps emphasize differences in winery styles.

==Tasting flights==
'''Tasting flight''' is a term used by wine tasters to describe a selection of wines, usually between three and eight glasses, but sometimes as many as fifty, presented for the purpose of sampling and comparison.

==Tasting notes==
A '''tasting note''' refers to a taster's written testimony about the aroma, taste identification, acidity, structure, texture, and balance of a wine. Online wine communities like [[Bottlenotes]] allow members to maintain their tasting notes online and for the reference of others.

==Serving temperature==
The temperature that a wine is served at can greatly affect the way it tastes and smells. Lower temperatures will emphasize [[acidity]] and [[tannins (wine)|tannin]]s while muting the [[aromatic]]s. Higher temperatures will minimize acidity and tannins while increasing the aromatics.

== Glassware ==
{{Main|Wine glass}}
The shape of a wineglass can have a subtle impact on the perception of wine, especially its bouquet.&lt;ref name="glass1"&gt;Huttenbrink, K., Schmidt, C., Delwiche, J., &amp; Hummel, T. (2001). The aroma of red wine is modified by the form of the wine glass. ''Laryno-Rhino-Otologie'', 80(2), 96–100.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="glass2"&gt;Delwiche, J., &amp; Pelchat, M. (2002). Influence of glass shape on wine aroma. ''Journal of Sensory Studies'', 17(1), 19–28.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="glass3"&gt;Hummel, T., Delwiche, J., Schmidt, C., &amp; Huttenbrink, K. (2003). Effects of the form of glasses on the perception of wine flavors: a study in untrained subjects. ''Appetite'', 41(2), 197–202.&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, the ideal shape is considered to be wider toward the bottom, with a narrower aperture at the top (tulip or egg shaped). Glasses which are widest at the top are considered the least ideal. Many wine tastings use [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] XL5 glasses,{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} which are "egg"-shaped. The effect of glass shape does not appear to be related to whether the glass is pleasing to look at.&lt;ref name="glass3"/&gt;

== Wine color ==
Without having tasted the wines, one does not know if, for example, a white is heavy or light. Before taking a sip, the taster tries to determine the order in which the wines should be assessed by appearance and nose alone. Heavy wines will be deeper in [[wine color|color]] and generally more intense on the nose. Sweeter wines, being denser, will leave thick, [[viscous]] streaks (called ''legs'' or ''[[Tears of wine|tears]]'') down the inside of the glass when swirled.

==Process==
[[File:Tempranillowine.jpg|thumb|right|Judging [[wine color|color]] is the first step in tasting wine.]]
There are five basic steps in tasting wine: color, swirl, smell, taste, and savor.&lt;ref name=course&gt;Zraly, Kevin. ''Windows on the World: Complete Wine Course''; Sterling Publishing, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; These are also known as the "five S" steps: see, swirl, sniff, sip, savor. During this process, a taster must look for clarity, varietal character, integration, expressiveness, complexity, and connectedness.&lt;ref name=winebible&gt;MacNeil, Karen. ''The Wine Bible''; Workman Publishing, New York (2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

A wine's color is better judged by putting it against a white background. The wine glass is put at an angle in order to see the colors. Colors can give the taster clues to the grape variety, and whether the wine was aged in wood.

===Characteristics assessed during tasting===
Varietal character describes how much a wine presents its inherent grape aromas.&lt;ref name="winebible"/&gt; A wine taster also looks for integration, which is a state in which none of the components of the wine ([[Acids in wine|acid]], tannin, alcohol, etc.) is out of balance with the other components. When a wine is well balanced, the wine is said to have achieved a harmonious fusion.&lt;ref name="winebible"/&gt;

Another important quality of the wine to look for is its expressiveness. Expressiveness is the quality the "wine possesses when its aromas and flavors are well-defined and clearly projected."&lt;ref name=winebible5&gt;MacNeil, Karen. ''The Wine Bible''; Workman Publishing, New York, p.5 (2001).&lt;/ref&gt; The complexity of the wine is affected by many factors, one of which may be the multiplicity of its flavors. The connectedness of the wine, a rather abstract and difficult to ascertain quality, describes the bond between the wine and its land of origin (terroir).&lt;ref name="winebible"/&gt;

===Connoisseur wine tasting===
A wine's quality can be judged by its bouquet and taste. The bouquet is the total aromatic experience of the wine. Assessing a wine's bouquet can also reveal faults such as [[cork taint]]; [[oxidation]] due to age, overexposure to oxygen, or lack of preservatives; and wild [[yeast (wine)|yeast]] or bacterial contamination, such as those due to [[Acetobacter]] or ''[[Brettanomyces]]'' yeasts.  Although low levels of ''Brettanomyces'' aromatic characteristics can be a positive attribute, giving the wine a distinctive character, generally it is considered a wine spoilage yeast.

The bouquet of wine is best revealed by gently swirling the wine in a wine glass to expose it to more oxygen and release more [[aromaticity|aromatic]]&lt;ref name=Gluckstern&gt;{{cite book | last=Gluckstern |first=Willie |title=The Wine Avenger |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster, Inc.|year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; etheric, ester, and aldehyde molecules that comprise the essential components of a wine's bouquet.&lt;ref name=course/&gt; [[Sparkling wine]] should not be swirled to the point of releasing bubbles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.maisons-champagne.com/encyclopedie/vignes_au_plaisir/erreurs.htm |title=Eviter les erreurs Encyclopédie des Vignes au plaisir |publisher=Maisons-champagne.com |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pausing to experience a wine's bouquet aids the wine taster in anticipating the wine's flavors. The "nose" of a wine – its bouquet or aroma – is the major determinate of perceived flavor in the mouth. Once inside the mouth, the aromatics are further liberated by exposure to body heat, and transferred [[Human nose|retronasally]] to the [[olfactory receptor]] site. It is here that the complex taste experience characteristic of a wine actually commences.

Thoroughly tasting a wine involves perception of its array of taste and [[mouthfeel]] attributes, which involve the combination of textures, flavors, weight, and overall "structure". Following appreciation of its olfactory characteristics, the wine taster savors a wine by holding it in the mouth for a few seconds to saturate the [[taste bud]]s. By pursing ones lips and breathing through that small opening oxygen will pass over the wine and release even more esters. When the wine is allowed to pass slowly through the mouth it presents the connoisseur with the fullest gustatory profile available to the human palate.

The acts of pausing and focusing through each step distinguishes wine tasting from simple quaffing. Through this process, the full array of aromatic molecules is captured and interpreted by approximately 15 million olfactory receptors,&lt;ref name=Gluckstern /&gt; comprising a few hundred olfactory receptor classes. When tasting several wines in succession, however, key aspects of this fuller experience (length and finish, or aftertaste) must necessarily be sacrificed through expectoration.

Although taste qualities are known to be widely distributed throughout the oral cavity, the concept of an anatomical "[[tongue map]]" yet persists in the wine tasting arena, in which different tastes are believed to map to different areas of the tongue. A widely accepted example is the misperception that the tip of the tongue uniquely tells how sweet a wine is and the upper edges tell its acidity.&lt;ref name=Gluckstern /&gt;

==Scoring wine==
{{main|wine rating}}
{{See also|Wine tasting descriptors}}
As part of the tasting process, and as a way of comparing the merits of the various wines, wines are given scores according to a relatively set system. This may be either by explicitly weighting different aspects, or by global judgment (although the same aspects would be considered). These aspects are 1) the appearance of the wine, 2) the nose or smell, 3) the palate or taste, and 4) overall.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.winepros.org/wine101/sensory_guide.htm Professional Friends of Wine]&lt;/ref&gt; Different systems weight these differently (e.g., appearance 15%, nose 35%, palate 50%). Typically, no modern wine would score less than half on any scale (which would effectively indicate an obvious fault). It is more common for wines to be scored out of 20 (including half marks) in Europe and parts of Australasia, and out of 100 in the US. However, different critics tend to have their own preferred system, and some gradings are also given out of 5 (again with half marks).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wine-searcher.com/wine-scores.lml Wine-Searcher]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Visiting wineries ==
Traveling to wine regions is one way of increasing skill in tasting. Many wine producers in wine regions all over the world offer tastings of their wine. Depending on the country or region, tasting at the winery may incur a small charge to allow the producer to cover costs.

It is not considered rude to spit out wine at a winery, even in the presence of the wine maker or owner. Generally, a [[spittoon]] will be provided. In some regions of the world, tasters simply spit on the floor or onto gravel surrounding barrels. It is polite to inquire about where to spit before beginning tasting.

== Attending wine schools ==
A growing number of wine schools can be found, offering wine tasting classes to the public. These programs often help a wine taster hone and develop their abilities in a controlled setting. Some also offer professional training for sommeliers and winemakers. It is even possible to learn how to assess wine methodically via e-learning.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wine Campus]] offers an Honours Brevet via e-learning&lt;/ref&gt;

== Expectoration ==
[[File:Crachoir by JM Rosier.JPG|thumb|upright|Spitting into a [[spittoon]] at a wine tasting.]]
Because intoxication can affect the consumer's judgment, wine tasters generally spit the wine out after they have assessed its quality at formal tastings, where dozens of wines may be assessed. However, since wine is absorbed through the skin inside the mouth, tasting from twenty to twenty-five samplings can still produce an intoxicating effect, depending on the alcoholic content of the wine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last =Walton| first =Stuart| title =Cook's Encyclopedia of Wine| year=2005| publisher =Anness Publishing Limited 2002, 2005| pages = 10, 11| isbn = 0-7607-4220-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sensory analysis ==
Tasting plays an important role in the [[sensory analysis]] (also referred to as [[organoleptic]] analysis) of wine. Employing a [[trained panel|trained]] or consumer panel, [[Oenology|oenologists]] may perform a variety of tests on the taste, aroma, mouthfeel and appeal of wines. [[Discrimination testing|Difference tests]] are important in determining whether different fermentation conditions or new vineyard treatments alter the character of a wine, something particularly important to producers who aim for consistency. Preference testing establishes consumer preference, while descriptive analysis determines the most prominent traits of the wine, some of which grace back labels. Blind tasting and other laboratory controls help mitigate bias and assure statistically significant results. Many large wine companies now boast their own sensory team, optimally consisting of a Ph.D. sensory scientist, a flavor chemist and a trained panel.

== Grape varieties ==
Wine grape varieties are variously evaluated according to a wide range of descriptors which draw comparisons with other, non-grape flavors and aromas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.winepros.org/wine101/grape_profiles/varietals.htm Varietal Profiles | Professional Friends of Wine&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.winestore.com/grape-varieties.php Grape Varieties Explained&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  The following table provides a brief and by no means exhaustive summary of typical descriptors for the better-known varietals.
