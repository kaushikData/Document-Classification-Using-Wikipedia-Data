'''Advisory circular''' (AC) refers to a type of publication offered by the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] (FAA) to provide guidance for compliance with [Airworthiness, pilot certification, operational standards, training standards, and any other rules within the 14 CFR Aeronautics and Space Title.]]. They define acceptable means, but not the only means, of accomplishing or showing compliance with airworthiness regulations.&lt;ref&gt;David B.

{{Listen|filename=Ultrasonic_bat_calls_short.ogg|title=Common Pipistrelle|description=Common Pipistrelle call heard on a heterodyne bat detector - 68&amp;nbsp;KB. This is a typical echolocation call with "feeding buzzes" when it attempts to capture an insect.|format=[[Ogg]]}}

A '''bat detector''' is a device used to detect the presence of [[bat]]s by converting their [[Animal echolocation|echolocation]] [[ultrasound]] signals, as they are emitted by the bats, to audible [[Frequency|frequencies]], usually about 120&amp;nbsp;[[Hertz|Hz]] to 15&amp;nbsp;kHz. There are [[#Other bat detector types|other types of detectors]] which record bat calls so that they can be analysed afterward, but these are more commonly referred to by their particular function.

Bats emit calls from about 12&amp;nbsp;kHz to 160&amp;nbsp;kHz, but the upper frequencies in this range are rapidly absorbed in air. Many bat detectors are limited to around 15&amp;nbsp;kHz to 125&amp;nbsp;kHz at best. Bat detectors are available commercially and also can be self-built.

==Using bat detectors==
Bat detectors are used to detect the presence of bats and also help form conclusions about their species.&lt;ref&gt;Ahlén, I. &amp; Baagøe, H. 1999. Use of ultrasound detectors for bat studies in Europe -- experiences from field identification, surveys and monitoring. Acta Chiropterologica, 1:137-150.&lt;/ref&gt; Some bat calls are distinct and easy to recognise such as the [[Horseshoe bat]]s; other calls are less distinct between similar species. While bats can vary their calls as they fly and hunt, the ear can be trained to recognise species according to the frequency ranges and repetition rates of the echolocation calls. Bats also emit social calls (non-echolocation calls) at ultrasound frequencies.

A major limitation of acoustic bat detectors is their range, which is limited by the absorption of ultrasound in air. At mid range frequencies around 50&amp;nbsp;kHz, the maximum range is only about 25 to 30 metres in average atmospheric conditions when bats fly. This decreases with increasing frequency. Some bat calls have components around 20&amp;nbsp;kHz or even lower and sometimes these can be detected at 2 or 3 times the usual range. However, only the lower frequency components will be detected at a distance. The usable range of bat detectors decreases with humidity and in misty conditions the maximum range can be very low.

It is important to recognise three types of bat echolocation call: [[frequency modulation]] (FM), constant frequency (CF) (sometimes called [[amplitude modulation]]), and composite calls with both FM and CF components. The following illustrates a bat making an FM type call followed by a bat which uses a CF type call:

{{Listen|filename=Keoka050510Bech&amp;LHS.ogg|title=Bat FM call and CF call|description=Frequency modulated call followed by a constant frequency call as heard on a heterodyne bat detector - 190 Kb|format=[[Ogg]]}}

The FM call is heard as rapid dry clicks and the CF call as peeps. These vary in frequency due to the [[Doppler effect]] as the bat flies past. A heterodyne bat detector exaggerates the Doppler effect. As the bat making the CF calls flies toward the detector, the pitch falls.

Several species of bat use a composite FM and CF call starting with a rapid falling FM call which slows to become a CF call at the end, giving a "hockey stick" shape to the graph. This makes the call sound different on a bat detector:

{{Listen|filename=Keoka020524Pip55Stereo.ogg|title=Bat hockey stick call|description=Soprano Pipistrelle call recorded on a heterodyne bat detector set to near the end frequency - 190 Kb|format=[[Ogg]]}}

This gives a much wetter sound that the pure FM call. Pipistrelles generally use the hockey stick call for general echolocation, but use only the FM part at times. The end frequencies for the Common Pipistrelle and the Soprano Pipistrelle are around 45&amp;nbsp;kHz and 55&amp;nbsp;kHz respectively, but these frequencies can vary widely.

There are three types of "real time" audio bat detector in common use: the heterodyne, frequency division, and time expansion. Some bat detectors combine two or all three types.

{{Listen|filename=Chirps20160512.mp3|title=Comparison heterodyn vs. time expansion|description=At second 9.6 the detector was switched from heterodyn mode (45 kHz) to 20 fold time expansion, replaying the 2.5 seconds previously recorded. Only time expansion reveals the presence of two different type of bat calls - 770 Kb|format=[[MP3]]}}

==Bat detector types==

===Heterodyne===

[[Heterodyne]] detectors are the most commonly used, and most self-build detectors are of this type. A heterodyne function is often also built into the other types of detector. A heterodyne bat detector simply shifts all the ultrasound frequencies downward by a fixed amount so we can hear them.

A "heterodyne" is a beat frequency such as can be heard when two close musical notes are played together. A heterodyne bat detector combines the bat call with a constant internal frequency so that sum and difference frequencies are generated. For instance, a bat call at 45&amp;nbsp;kHz and an internal frequency of 43&amp;nbsp;kHz produces output frequencies of 2&amp;nbsp;kHz and 88&amp;nbsp;kHz. The 88&amp;nbsp;kHz frequency is inaudible and is filtered out and the 2&amp;nbsp;kHz frequency is fed to a loudspeaker or headphones. The internal frequency is displayed on a dial or on a display.

A better quality version of a heterodyne, or direct conversion, bat detector is the super-heterodyne detector. In this case the bat signal is mixed with a high frequency oscillator, typically around 450–600&amp;nbsp;kHz. The difference frequency is then amplified and filtered in an 'intermediate frequency' or i.f. amplifier before being converted back to audible frequencies again. This design, which is based on standard radio design, gives improved frequency discrimination and avoids problems with interference from the local oscillator.

In more recent DSP-based detectors, the heterodyne conversion can be done entirely digitally.

The tuning issue can be addressed by using a scanning circuit to enable the detector to scan the spectrum automatically and stop scanning when a bat call is heard. One example of such a detector is the [http://home.earthlink.net/~bat-detector/Scanner/BatScanner.html Bat Scanner].

It is also possible to use a 'comb spectrum' generator as the local oscillator so that the detector is effectively tuned to lots of frequencies, 10&amp;nbsp;kHz apart, all at once.

Some early bat detectors used ex Navy, low frequency radio sets, simply replacing the aerial with a microphone and pre-amplifier. It is also possible to modify a portable Long Wave radio to be a bat detector by adjusting the tuning frequencies and replacing the [[ferrite rod]] aerial with a microphone and pre-amplifier.

====How it is used====

The operator guesses the likely species to be present and tunes the frequency accordingly. Many users will start listening around 45&amp;nbsp;kHz. If a bat is seen or a bat-like call is heard, the frequency is tuned up and down until the clearest sound is heard.

Species like Pipistrelles which end their call with a "hockey stick" CF component can be recognised according to the lowest frequency which gives the clearest "plop" sound. Horseshoe bats give a peeping sound at a frequency depending on their species. FM calls all tend to sound like clicks, but the start and end frequencies and the call repetition pattern can give clues as to the species.

====Pros and cons====

The advantages of a heterodyne bat detector is that it works in real time, exaggerates the frequency changes of a bat call, is easy to use, and is the least expensive. It is easy to recognise a [[Doppler effect|doppler shift]] in CF calls of flying bats due to their speed of flight. Stereo listening and recording is possible with models such as the [http://freenet-homepage.de/CSE-Lenk/welcome.htm CSE stereo heterodyne detector] (broken link!), and this can help to track bats when visibility is poor.

The disadvantages of a heterodyne bat detector are that it can only convert a narrow band of frequencies, typically 5&amp;nbsp;kHz, and has to be continually retuned, and can easily miss species out of its current tuned range.

===Frequency division===

Frequency division (FD) bat detectors synthesise a sound which is a fraction of the bat call frequencies, typically 1/10. This is done by converting the call into a [[square wave]], otherwise called a zero crossing signal. This square wave is then divided using an electronic counter by 10 to provide another square wave. Square waves sound harsh and contain [[harmonic]]s which can cause problems in analysis so these are filtered out where possible. Some recent all-digital detectors can synthesise a sine wave instead of a square wave. One example of a detector which synthesises a sine-wave FD output is the [https://web.archive.org/web/20150512141214/http://www.batbox.com/griffin.asp Griffin]

Some FD detectors output this constant level signal which renders background noise and bat calls at the same high level. This causes problems with both listening and analysis. More sophisticated FD detectors such as the [https://web.archive.org/web/20140808225454/http://www.batbox.com/duet.asp Batbox Duet] measure the incoming volume level, limiting the noise threshold, and use this to restore the output level variations. This and other sophisticated FD detectors also include a heterodyne detector and provide a jack output so that independent outputs can be recorded for later analysis.

====How it is used====

With dual output FD detectors, headphones can be used to monitor both outputs simultaneously, or the loudspeaker used with the heterodyne function and the FD output recorded and analysed later. Alternatively, listening to the FD output gives an audible rendering of the bat call at 1/10 frequency. An example of a dual detector is the [http://www.batplanet.co.uk/page5.html Ciel CDB301].

Dual FD/heterodyne detectors are useful for cross country transects especially when there is a function provided for recording voice notes such as times, locations and recognised bat calls. The output or outputs are recorded on cassette tape, Minidisc or solid state recorders, downloaded to a computer, and analysed using custom software. Calls missed by the heterodyne function, if present, can be seen and measured on the analysis.

====Pros and cons====

Advantages, As with a heterodyne detector, an FD detector works in real time with or without a heterodyne function. Bat calls can be heard in their entirety over their whole range rather than over a limited frequency range. Retuning with an FD detector is not required although this is done with a dual type with heterodyne. By analysing the recording later, the entire call frequency range and the call pattern can be measured.

A serious disadvantage with real time listening is that the speed of a bat call remains fast, often too fast for the species to be recognised. The frequency changes of CF calls are not exaggerated as with a heterodyne detector and so are less noticeable. Also with some species such as the Lesser Horseshoe bat with a call around 110&amp;nbsp;kHz, the resulting frequency is still quite high although it can be recorded. The synthesising of the call means that only one bat call can be reproduced at a time and a muddle is caused by simultaneous calls. Surprisingly, this is not a great disadvantage when analysing a recording later

===Time expansion===

Time expansion (TE) detectors work by digitising the bat calls at a high sampling rate using an [[analog-to-digital converter]] and storing the digitised signal in an on-board memory.

TE detectors are "real time" devices in that they can be monitored at the time of recording, but there is an inevitable delay while the high speed sampled extract is slowed down and replayed.

====How it is used====

In real time mode, with or without an associated heterodyne or FD detector, the slowed down calls can be heard as a drawn-out bat call at audible frequencies. Therefore, fast FM calls can be heard as a descending note instead of a click. Thus it is possible to hear the difference between FM calls which just sound like clicks on the other types of detector.

After downloading an audio recording to a computer, the original calls are analysed as if they were still at the original non-expanded rate.

====Pros and cons====

The output can be recorded with an audio recorder as with FD detectors, or with more recent units, the signal can be recorded directly to an internal digital memory such as a compact flash card. The whole waveform is recorded with the full call range being preserved, rather than 1/10 of the waveform as in a FD detector. Since both frequency and amplitude information are preserved in the recorded call, more data is available for species analysis.

Early units were equipped with small memories which limited the length of time that could be digitised. Once the memory was filled (usually only a few seconds maximum), the unit would then replay the recording at slower rate, typically between 1/10 to 1/32 of the rate of the original recording. While the recorded sample is being played back slowly, nothing is being recorded, so the bat calls are being sampled intermittently. For instance, when a 1-second call is being played back at 1/32 rate, 32 seconds of bat calls are not being recorded.

More recent time-expansion recorders use large flash-based memories (such as removable compact-flash cards) and high-bandwidth direct-to-card recording to provide continuous, full-bandwidth real-time recording. Such units can record continuously for many hours while maintaining the maximum information within the signal.

Some units are also equipped with an auto-record function and these can be left in-the-field for many days.

Some units also include a pre-buffer feature to capture events that happened shortly before the 'record' button was pressed which can be useful for manual surveys.

TE detectors are typically used for professional and research work, as they allow a complete analysis of the bats' calls at a later time.

==Sampling frequency for digital/TE detectors==
Research in 2010 observed that frequencies used by bats can be has high as 250&amp;nbsp;kHz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Breaking the trade-off: rainforest bats maximize bandwidth and repetition rate of echolocation calls as they approach prey | author = Daniela A. Schmieder | publisher = Max Planck Gesellschaft|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;). The [[Nyquist–Shannon sampling theorem]] observes that the minimum sampling frequency required to record a signal successfully must be greater than twice the bandwidth of the signal. To record a bandwidth of 250&amp;nbsp;kHz therefore requires a sampling frequency in excess of 500&amp;nbsp;kHz. Modern Time-Expansion capable units typically sample at between 300&amp;nbsp;kHz and 700&amp;nbsp;kHz. In general, faster is better, though a higher sampling frequency does use more storage space.

==Other bat detector types==

===Zero crossing analysis===

ZCA is best known as an add-on device to the Anabat bat detector. The original bat calls are digitised and the zero crossing points used to produce a data stream which is recorded on a Compact Flash card. There are sophisticated timing controls and the device can be set to respond to bat calls, so that many hours of recording are available in unmanned situations. The purpose of ZCA is to reduce the amount of data which must be recorded to the memory and may be considered as a simple form of [[lossy compression|lossy data compression]]. Historically, to achieve long recording times, such information reduction has been necessary due to memory capacity limitations and memory cost.

The solid state ZCA recording is analysed by custom software to produce a time/frequency plot of each call which can be examined for species recognition in a similar way to FD or TE recordings.

====How it is used====

The ZCA detector is usually placed in a bat roost or bat flight path and left for a number of days to collect data. Thus it is less labour-intensive than using a manned bat detector in real time.

====Pros and cons====

While the ZCA detector can also be used in real time, its value is for remote recording over long periods. The analysis is similar to that for FD recordings, but there is no amplitude data included. However it does accurately record each zero crossing point, rather than only one in ten. As with all recording devices triggered by an input, a ZCA detector recording automatically is prone to ultrasonic interference from insects such as crickets. Filters can be written to select a characteristic frequency of certain species and ignore others; some (CF species) are more easily filtered, others are nigh on impossible.

===High frequency recording===

This can be done by using a high speed digitiser peripheral on a computer such as a laptop. This is not a bat detector as such, but recordings of bat calls can be analysed similarly to TE recordings. This method produces large data files and produces no means of detecting bat calls without the simultaneous use of a bat detector. There are however also more sophisticated systems such as the [http://www.avisoft.com/usg/usg116hm.htm Avisoft-UltraSoundGate] that can replace a conventional bat detector. These advanced systems additionally provide a real-time spectrographic display, automated call parameter measurement and classification tools, integrated GPS functionality and a versatile metadata input tool for documenting the recordings.

===DSP detectors===

DSP bat detectors aim to provide an acoustically accurate portrayal of bat calls by using a [[digital signal processor]] to map bats' ultrasounds signals to audible sounds; different algorithms are being used to accomplish this, and there is active development and tuning of algorithms going on.
One strategy called "frequency shifting" uses a FFT signal analysis in order to find the main frequency and signal power, then using digital simulation a new audible wave is synthesized from the original one divided by a defined value.

The processes of Frequency Division and Heterodyne conversion can also be performed digitally.

===Time domain signal coding===

This type of bat detector is believed to be in pre-production or experimental and is not available commercially.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} Research is in progress for analysing many types of ultrasound calls and sounds besides those of bats.&lt;ref name="TDSC_Paper"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chesmore|first1=E. D|title=Application of time domain signal coding and artificial neural networks to passive acoustical identification of animals|journal=Applied Acoustics|date=1 December 2001|volume=62|issue=12|pages=1359–1374|doi=10.1016/S0003-682X(01)00009-3|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003682X01000093|accessdate=7 July 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A TDSC detector digitises the original calls and derives a two dimensional data string by analysing the parameters of each call with respect to time. This is analysed by a [[Artificial neural network|neural network]] to provide pattern recognition for each species.

==Non-acoustic detection==

'''Visual observation''' is the obvious means of detecting bats, but of course this can only be done in daylight or [[crepuscular]] conditions (i.e., dusk and dawn). Emergence counts are done visually at dusk, using a bat detector for confirmation of species. In lower light conditions a [[night vision device]] can be used but the more affordable generation 1 type has a lag time which fails to provide a suitable image of a flying bat.

'''[[Infrared]] (IR) cameras''' and camcorders are used with an IR illuminator to observe bat emergences and bat behaviour inside and outside roosts. The problem with this method is that deriving a count from a recording is tedious and time consuming, but camcorders can be useful as a backup in roost emergence counts to observe bats re-entering the roost. Many Sony camcorders are sensitive to infrared.

'''[[Infrared]] beam devices''' usually consist of a dual array of invisible IR beams. The size of the roost entrance determines the number of beams necessary and thus the power required and potential for off-mains use. Single beam DIY systems are available for bat boxes but these do not log the direction of transit. Almost all the systems in use today are non-commercial or DIY. A system in use in some mines in Wisconsin uses two arrays of beams however they are spaced quite far apart and consequently only log approximately 50% of the bats although extrapolated figures are achieved through correlation of time stamped video and beam break data. The [[Countryside Council for Wales]] (CCW) uses two similar systems with beams spaced close enough together that every bat transiting the entrance is logged along with the temperature. These systems require either mains power or 12&amp;nbsp;V deep cycle batteries. They can be used in conjunction with an Anabat Zcaim installed in a 6" soil pipe and pointed across the roost entrance to discriminate between species by correlating the time stamp data from the IR array and filtered Anabat Zcaim data for horsehoe bats (relatively easy due to their easily identifiable CF echolocation which can be filtered automatically using Anabat software).

Data from beam break systems must be carefully analysed to eliminate "light sampling behaviour" (environment sampling) where the bats repeatedly leave the roost and return immediately if the conditions are not suitable. Some systems discriminate for bat sized animals; they determine if the beams are broken by a bat sized animal and ignore all other transits. It is important that data is analysed using a methodology which takes light sampling behaviour into account. The method which seems to give the most accurate results is as follows: "out" transit assigned 1, "in" transit assigned -1. Start count is set to zero at 4 p.m. daily. Using a spreadsheet, the counts are added cumulatively from 4 p.m. each day until 9 a.m. the next day. The maximum "positive" count can easily be found for each day. Since every transit is time stamped, the exact time of the maximum daily count is also known. Light sampling counts are eliminated from the data since an "out" 1 is cancelled by an "in" -1, resulting in a cumulative count of zero for light sampling bats.

'''[[Thermography|Thermal imagers]]''' which are of a high enough definition to register bats at over 30 metres range are expensive, but have been used to assess the dangers of wind turbines to birds and bats. "Affordable" thermal imagers have a bat detecting range about the same order of acoustic bat detectors due to the small size and the low heat emissions of bats.

'''[[Passive infrared sensor]]s''' are slow with a response speed of the order of a tenth of a second and will normally not detect a small fast mammal like a bat.

'''Radar''' has been used to detect bats beyond the acoustic limit, but is very costly in equipment and man hours. Bird Aircraft Strike Hazard [https://web.archive.org/web/20070824164536/http://detect-inc.com/bash.html (BASH)] installations are capable of detecting bats, but are usually situated where few bats fly. There are very few suitable mobile terrestrial radars available anywhere. Hand-held doppler radar modules have been used in the field to allow researchers to compensate for the doppler shift imposed on recordings of bat signals due to their flight speed. This allows the researchers to tell whether the bats are changing the pitch of their calls in flight.

[[File:Algae hydrogen production.jpg|thumb|Microbial hydrogen production.]]
'''Biohydrogen''' is H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; that is produced biologically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Biohydrogen|editor=M. Rögner|year=2015|publisher=De Gruyter|isbn=978-3-11-033673-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Interest is high in this technology because H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is a clean fuel and can be readily produced from certain kinds of biomass.&lt;ref&gt;Y.-H. Percival Zhang "Hydrogen Production from Carbohydrates: A Mini-Review" in "Sustainable Production of Fuels, Chemicals, and Fibers from Forest Biomass" ACS Symposium Series, 2011, Volume 1067, pages=203-216.&lt;/ref&gt;  Many challenges characterize this technology, including those intrinsic to H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, such as storage and transportation of a noncondensible gas.  Hydrogen producing organisms are poisoned by O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.  Yields of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are often low.

==Biochemical principles==
The main reactions involve [[fermentation]] of sugars.  Important reactions start with [[glucose]], which is converted to [[acetic acid]]:&lt;ref&gt;Thauer, R. K., "Biochemistry of Methanogenesis: a Tribute to Marjory Stephenson", Microbiology 1998, 144, 2377-2406.  {{DOI|10.1099/00221287-144-9-2377}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;  +  2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O   →  2 CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H  +  2 CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  +  4 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
A related reaction gives [[formate]] instead of [[carbon dioxide]]:
:C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;  +  2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O   →  2 CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H  +  2 HCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H  +  2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
These reactions are exergonic by 216 and 209 kcal/mol, respectively.

H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production is catalyzed by two [[hydrogenase]]s.  One is called [FeFe]-hydrogenase; the other is called [NiFe]-hydrogenase.  Many organisms express these enzymes.  Notable examples are members of the genera [[Clostridium]], [[Desulfovibrio]], [[Ralstonia]], and the pathogen ''[[Helicobacter]]''.  ''[[E. coli]]'' is the workhorse for genetic engineering of hydrogenases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors=Cammack, R.; Frey, M.; Robson, R.|title=Hydrogen as a Fuel: Learning from Nature|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|place=London|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been estimated that 99% of all organisms utilize [[dihydrogen]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). Most of these species are microbes and their ability to use H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as a metabolite arises from the expression of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; [[metalloenzyme]]s known as hydrogenases.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Hydrogenases are sub-classified into three different types based on the active site metal content: iron-iron hydrogenase, nickel-iron hydrogenase, and iron hydrogenase. 
[[File:ActiveSitesCorrected.png|thumb|center|x140px|The active site structures of the three types of hydrogenase enzymes.]]

==History==
In 1933, [[Marjory Stephenson]] and her student Stickland reported that cell suspensions catalysed the reduction of [[methylene blue]] with H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Six years later, [[Hans Gaffron]] observed that the green photosynthetic alga ''[[Chlamydomonas reinhardtii]]'', would sometimes  produce hydrogen.  Gaffron and many other scientists failed to elucidate how it induced hydrogen production. In the late 1990s [[Anastasios Melis]] discovered that deprivation of sulfur induces the alga to switch from the production of oxygen (normal photosynthesis) to the production of hydrogen. He found that the [[enzyme]] responsible for this reaction is [[hydrogenase]], but that the hydrogenase lost this function in the presence of oxygen. Melis also discovered that depleting the amount of sulfur available to the algae interrupted their internal oxygen flow, allowing the hydrogenase an environment in which it can react, causing the algae to produce hydrogen.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/10.04/mustread.html?pg=5 Reengineering Algae To Fuel The Hydrogen Economy]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Chlamydomonas moewusii'' is also a promising strain for the production of hydrogen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| url = http://www.plantphysiol.org/cgi/content/full/127/3/740 |vauthors=Melis A, Happe T|lastauthoramp=yes |year = 2001 | title = Hydrogen Production.

==Industrial hydrogen==
Competing for biohydrogen, at least for commercial applications, are many mature industrial processes.  Hydrogen is usually derived from [[fossil fuels]] by [[steam reforming]] of [[natural gas]] - sometimes referred to as steam methane reforming (SMR) - is the most common method of producing bulk hydrogen at about 95% of the world production.&lt;ref&gt;P.

The '''Bris sextant''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|r|iː|s}} is not a [[sextant]] proper, but is a small angle-measuring device that can be used for navigation. The ''Bris'' is, however, a true [[reflecting instrument]] which derives its high accuracy from the same principle of double reflection which is fundamental to the octant, the true sextant, and other reflecting instruments. It differs from other sextants primarily in being a fixed angle sextant, capable of measuring a few specific angles.

[[Sven Yrvind]] (Lundin) developed his '''Bris sextant''' as part of his quest for low-cost, low-technology equipment for ocean crossings. The ''Bris'' is a low-technology, high-precision, fixed-interval instrument. It is made of two narrow, flat pieces of glass ([[microscope slide]]s) permanently and rigidly mounted in a V-shape to a third flat piece of #12 [[Welding helmet|welding glass]] to make viewing the sun eye safe. When the sun or moon is viewed through the V, it is split into eight images. The instrument is small and rugged enough that it can be kept in a [[35mm film|35mm film canister]] (about 2&amp;nbsp;cm radius, 3&amp;nbsp;cm tall) on a lanyard around one's neck.

The Bris sextant is calibrated at a known geographic position with a good clock and a [[nautical almanac]]. As the day passes, one works the sight reductions backwards to develop exact angles for each of the images' tops and bottoms.   The [[Sun]] and [[Moon]] have approximately the same [[Angular diameter#Use in astronomy|angular size]] from the surface of the [[Earth]], and can use the same [[calibration]]s.

In use, one waits until an image's edge touches the horizon, and then records the time and reduces the sight using the recorded angle for that edge of the image.

==Etymology==

''Bris'' is Swedish for ''breeze''. It would appear that the name ''Bris'' is used by Yrvind for a number of his sail boats and is a favourite of his.

[[File:Professor-SF-Attached.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The Professor SF, made by Bung, was a backup device for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super Famicom]]]]
'''Bung Enterprises Ltd.''' was an electronics company based in [[Hong Kong]]. Its products were controversial [[game backup device|backup and development units]] for videogame consoles, which could allow the user to play a game without owning the original cartridge. Backup units for [[Nintendo Entertainment System]], [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]], [[Neo Geo (console)|Neo-Geo]], [[Neo Geo Pocket]], [[Sega Genesis|Genesis]], [[Game Boy]] and [[Nintendo 64]] were developed and produced by Bung.

"Bung" is the approximate pronunciation of the company's Chinese name 邦谷. Both written forms were used in product packaging and marketing literature, and the somewhat crude connotation of the English word appears to have been an unintended coincidence. Although in business for more than a decade, the company was relatively unknown in the West until the late 1990s. In 1997 it began selling the [[Doctor V64]], the first commercially available copier for the [[Nintendo 64]], which quickly gained popularity in the
United States and Europe.  The following year, it released the V64 Jr, a lower cost model without a CD-ROM drive.  The company also began selling rewritable [[flash memory]] cards for the [[Game Boy]], and a programming interface called the GB Xchanger.

During this time period, [[Nintendo]] became increasingly aggressive at trying to stop Bung and the sale of its products. Nintendo first filed lawsuits in the United States against retailers Carl Industries and Upstate Games, accusing them of contributory [[copyright infringement]] for selling Bung products. This was initially a somewhat difficult case for Nintendo, as under the
[[Sony Corp. of America v. Universal City Studios, Inc.|Betamax]] precedent, copying devices were legal in the United States if they
had non-infringing uses. It turned out that due to a severe shortage of official development hardware from Nintendo, many game developers had been buying from Bung instead. When Bung became aware of this, they began promoting their products for this purpose, and even sponsored a coding competition for amateur game developers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110611190119/http://defaced.co.uk/bung/GBCodingCompetition/1stGBCodingCompetition/1st_results.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; The US lawsuits were eventually settled, with the retailers agreeing to stop selling the copying devices.

Nintendo tried a different tactic to stop sales in Europe by reporting Bung products as not being [[CE mark]] certified. This resulted in Bung having their [[power adapter]]s certified, and sales continued. Nintendo next filed a lawsuit against Bung in Hong Kong.  The owners of Bung Enterprises responded by dissolving the corporation in March 2000. A few months later they formed a new company under the name First Union Technology, and began selling the same products with different labeling, using the brand name Mr. Flash. The V64 Jr. was sold as the E64, and the GB Xchanger became the Flash Linker.

After Nintendo succeeded in having shipments of the new "Mr. Flash" products confiscated by [[U.S. Customs and Border Protection|US Customs]], the company stopped selling directly to US residents, but sales through third parties continued. Nintendo next focused on Hong Kong retailer [[Lik Sang]], which [[Microsoft]] and [[Sony]] were also targeting due to sales of [[modchips]].  This led to a slightly embarrassing incident in February 2002 in which US Customs intercepted a rather innocuous package containing a [[serial cable]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kuro5hin.org/?op=displaystory;sid=2002/2/13/235853/482]&lt;/ref&gt; Package seizures apparently ceased after this incident.  In October 2002, Nintendo, Sony, and Microsoft jointly filed suit against Lik-Sang,&lt;ref&gt;[http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=02/10/03/1623204]&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in the company shutting down for two weeks, and then reopening sans the disputed products.&lt;ref&gt;[http://games.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=02/10/15/1558215]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Game Doctor/Professor SF===
Known in Hong Kong as "超任博士" (literally means ''Super Nintendo Doctor''), this unit was designed for the backing up of [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super Famicom/Super NES]] games.

===GB Xchanger===
This unit was designed for the backing up of [[Game Boy]] and [[Game Boy Color]] games. It was also used to write said backups onto a flash cartridge for use on the consoles in question. The unit was designed with a Game Boy-specific slot on the top of the unit and took 6 AAA batteries or a 9V adapter for power, and it connected to a PC via a parallel port.

===Neo Flash Linker===
This unit was designed for the backing up of [[Neo-Geo Pocket]] and [[Neo-Geo Pocket Color]] games. The physical construction was identical to that of the GB Xchanger unit, save for the Neo-Geo Pocket slot on top, as opposed to the Game Boy slot. NGP flash carts were also available.

[[Image:Burma Shave Tube.jpg|thumb|right|1940s Burma-Shave tube and box]]&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Burma shave.jpg|thumb|100px|A 1960s shaving cream spray can with no [[hyphen]].]] --&gt;

'''Burma-Shave''' was an American brand of [[Shaving brush|brushless]] [[shaving cream]], famous for its advertising gimmick of posting humorous rhyming poems on small sequential highway roadside signs.

==History==
Burma-Shave was introduced in 1925 by the Burma-Vita company in [[Minneapolis]] owned by Clinton Odell. The company's original product was a [[liniment]] made of ingredients described as having come "from the Malay Peninsula and Burma" (hence its name).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first1=Frank |last1=Rowsome |first2=Carl |last2=Rose |title=The Verse by the Side of the Road: The Story of the Burma-Shave Signs and Jingles |location=[[Brattleboro, Vermont]] |publisher=Stephen Greene Press |year=1965 |oclc=656940 |page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sales were sparse, and the company sought to expand sales by introducing a product with wider appeal.

The result was the Burma-Shave brand of brushless shaving cream and its supporting advertising program. Sales increased. At its peak, Burma-Shave was the second-highest-selling brushless shaving cream in the US. Sales declined in the 1950s, and in 1963 the company was sold to [[Altria Group|Philip Morris]]. The signs were removed at that time. The brand decreased in visibility and eventually became the property of the [[American Safety Razor Company]].

In 1997, the American Safety Razor Company reintroduced the Burma-Shave brand with a nostalgic shaving soap and brush kit, though the original Burma-Shave was a brushless shaving cream, and Burma-Shave's own roadside signs frequently ridiculed "Grandpa's old-fashioned shaving brush."

==Roadside billboards==
[[Image:BurmaShaveSigns Route66.jpg|thumb|alt=A set of 6 white-on-red signs with white block text along the side of a road, reading in order "BIG MISTAKE", "MANY MAKE", "RELY ON HORN", "INSTEAD OF BRAKE", and, stylized, "Burma-Shave".|Set of signs promoting Burma-Shave, on [[U.S. Route 66]].]]
Burma-Shave sign series first appeared on U.S. Highway 65 near [[Lakeville, Minnesota]], in 1926, and remained a major advertising component until 1963 in most of the contiguous United States. The first series read: ''Cheer up, face - the war is over!  Burma-Shave''.&lt;ref name="Inc.1959"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kiplinger Washington Editors, Inc.|title=Kiplinger's Personal Finance|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=awAEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA20|date=October 1959|publisher=Kiplinger Washington Editors, Inc.|page=20|issn=1528-9729}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exceptions were [[New Mexico]], [[Arizona]], and [[Nevada]] (deemed to have insufficient road traffic), and [[Massachusetts]] (eliminated due to that state's high land rentals and roadside foliage). Typically, six consecutive small signs would be posted along the edge of highways, spaced for sequential reading by passing motorists. The last sign was almost always the name of the product. The signs were originally produced in two color combinations: red-and-white and orange-and-black, though the latter was eliminated after a few years. A special white-on-blue set of signs was developed for [[South Dakota]], which restricted the color [[red]] on roadside signs to official warning notices.

This use of a series of small signs, each of which bore part of a commercial message, was a successful approach to highway advertising during the early years of highway travel, drawing the attention of passing motorists who were curious to learn the [[Punch line|punchline]]. As the [[Interstate Highway System|Interstate]] system expanded in the late 1950s and vehicle speeds increased, it became more difficult to attract motorists' attention with small signs. When the company was acquired by [[Altria Group|Philip Morris]], the signs were discontinued on advice of counsel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Some of the signs featured safety messages about speeding instead of advertisements.

Examples of Burma-Shave advertisements are at [[The House on the Rock]] in [[Spring Green, Wisconsin]]. Re-creations of Burma-Shave sign sets also appear on [[Arizona State Highway 66]], part of the original [[U.S. Route 66]], between Ash Fork, Arizona, and [[Kingman, Arizona]], (though they were not installed there by Burma-Shave during its original campaigns) and on Old U.S. Highway 30 near Ogden, Iowa. Other examples are displayed at [[The Henry Ford]] in [[Dearborn, Michigan]], the [[Interstate 44 in Missouri]] rest area between Rolla and Springfield (which has [[U.S. Route 66 in Missouri|old Route 66]] building picnic structures), the [[Forney Transportation Museum]] in [[Denver, Colorado]] and the [[Virginia Museum of Transportation]] in [[Roanoke, Virginia]].

===Examples===
The complete list of the 600 or so known sets of signs is listed in ''Sunday Drives'' and in the last part of ''The Verse by the Side of the Road''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first1=Frank |last1=Rowsome |first2=Carl |last2=Rose |title=The Verse by the Side of the Road: The Story of the Burma-Shave Signs and Jingles |location=[[Brattleboro, Vermont]] |publisher=Stephen Greene Press |year=1965 |oclc=656940}}{{Page needed|date=August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The content of the earliest signs is lost, but it is believed that the first recorded signs, for 1927 and soon after, are close to the originals. The first ones were prosaic advertisements. Generally the signs were printed with all capital letters. The style shown below is for readability:
*Shave the modern way / No brush / No lather / No rub-in / Big tube 35 cents - Drug stores / Burma-Shave

As early as 1928, the writers were displaying a puckish sense of humor:
*Takes the "H" out of shave / Makes it save / Saves complexion / Saves time and money / No brush - no lather / Burma-Shave

In 1929, the prosaic ads began to be replaced by actual verses on four signs, with the fifth sign merely a filler for the sixth:
*Every shaver / Now can snore / Six more minutes / Than before / By using / Burma-Shave
*Your shaving brush / Has had its day / So why not / Shave the modern way / With / Burma-Shave

Previously there were only two to four sets of signs per year. 1930 saw major growth in the company, and 19 sets of signs were produced. The writers recycled a previous joke. They continued to ridicule the "old" style of shaving. And they began to appeal to the wives as well:
*Cheer up face / The war is past / The "H" is out / Of shave / At last / Burma-Shave
*Shaving brushes / You'll soon see 'em / On the shelf / In some / Museum / Burma-Shave
*Does your husband / Misbehave / Grunt and grumble / Rant and rave / Shoot the brute some / Burma-Shave

In 1931, the writers began to reveal a "cringe factor" side to their creativity, which would increase over time:
*No matter / How you slice it / It's still your face / Be humane / Use / Burma-Shave

In 1932, the company recognized the popularity of the signs with a self-referencing gimmick:
*Free / Illustrated / Jingle book / In every / Package / Burma-Shave
*A shave / That's real / No cuts to heal / A soothing / Velvet after-feel / Burma-Shave

In 1935, the first known appearance of a road safety message appeared, combined with a punning sales pitch:
*Train approaching / Whistle squealing / Stop / Avoid that run-down feeling / Burma-Shave
*Keep well / To the right / Of the oncoming car / Get your close shaves / From the half pound jar / Burma-Shave

Safety messages began to increase in 1939, as these examples show. (The first of the four is a parody of "[[Paul Revere's Ride (poem)|Paul Revere's Ride]]" by [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]].)
*Hardly a driver / Is now alive / Who passed / On hills / At 75 / Burma-Shave
*Past / Schoolhouses / Take it slow / Let the little / Shavers grow / Burma-Shave
*If you dislike / Big traffic fines / Slow down / Till you / Can read these signs / Burma-Shave
*Don't take / a curve / at 60 per. / We hate to lose / a customer / Burma-Shave&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bryson |first=Bill |title=Mother Tongue: English &amp; How It Got That Way |isbn=0688078958 |lccn=2010655007 |publisher=Penguin Books |page=230}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1939 and subsequent years, demise of the signs was foreshadowed, as busy roadways approaching larger cities featured shortened versions of the slogans on one, two, or three signs &amp;mdash; the exact count is not recorded. The puns include a play on the [[Maxwell House]] Coffee slogan, standard puns, and yet another reference to the "H" joke:
*Good to the last strop
*Covers a multitude of chins
*Takes the "H" out of shaving

The war years found the company recycling a lot of their old signs, with new ones mostly focusing on [[World War II]] propaganda:
*Let's make [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] / And [[Hirohito]] / Feel as bad / as Old [[Benito Mussolini|Benito]] / Buy War Bonds / Burma-Shave
*Slap / The Jap / With / Iron / Scrap / Burma-Shave

1963 was the last year for the signs, most of which were repeats, including the final slogan, which had first appeared in 1953:
*Our fortune / Is your / Shaven face / It's our best / Advertising space / Burma-Shave

Possibly the ultimate in self-referencing signs, leaving out the product name. This one also adorns the cover of the book:
*If you / Don't know / Whose signs / These are / You can't have / Driven very far

===Special promotional messages===
*Free offer! Free offer! / Rip a [[Fender (vehicle)|fender]] off your car / mail it in / for a half-pound jar / Burma-Shave
::A large number of [[Fender (vehicle)|fenders]] were received by the company, which made good on its promise.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first1=Frank |last1=Rowsome |first2=Carl |last2=Rose |title=The Verse by the Side of the Road: The Story of the Burma-Shave Signs and Jingles |location=[[Brattleboro, Vermont]] |publisher=Stephen Greene Press |year=1965 |oclc=656940 |page=56}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Free — free / a trip to Mars / for 900 / empty jars / Burma-Shave
::One respondent, Arlyss French, who was the owner of a [[Red Owl (retail chain)|Red Owl]] grocery store, did submit 900 empty jars; the company at first replied: "If a trip to Mars / you earn / remember, friend / there's no return."  Then Burma-Shave, on the recommendation of Red Owl's publicity team, withdrew the one-way offer and instead sent Mr. and Mrs. French on vacation to the town of [[Moers]] (often pronounced "Mars" by foreigners) near [[Duisburg]], [[North Rhine-Westphalia]], Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Steve Harvey |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1997/jul/19/local/me-17878 |title=Close Shave for a Space Mission |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=19 July 1997 |accessdate=2 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/business/market/mars.asp |title=The Read Planet |work=[[Snopes.com]] |first= David |last=Mikkelson |date=10 May 2011|accessdate=2 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In popular culture===

A number of films and television shows set between the 1920s and 1950s have used the Burma-Shave roadside billboards to help set the scene. Examples include ''[[Bonnie and Clyde (film)|Bonnie and Clyde]]'', ''[[A River Runs Through It (film)|A River Runs Through It]]'', ''[[The World's Fastest Indian]]'', ''[[Stand by Me (film)|Stand By Me]]'', ''[[Sleepy-Time Tom|Tom and Jerry]]'', ''[[M*A*S*H]]'' and the pilot episode ("Genesis") of ''[[Quantum Leap (TV series)|Quantum Leap]]''. The long-running series ''[[Hee Haw]]'' borrowed the style for program [[commercial bumper|bumpers]], transitioning from one show segment to the next or to commercials.

The final episode of the popular television series ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]'' featured a series of road signs in Korea ''"Hawk was gone, now he's here. Dance til dawn, give a cheer. Burma-Shave"'' in the style of Burma-Shave adverts in US roads in the 1950s.

[[Roger Miller]]'s song "Burma Shave" (the B-side to his 1961 single "Fair Swiss Maiden") has the singer musing that he's "seen a million rows of them little red poetic signs up and down the line", while reciting rhymes in the manner of the ads. [[Tom Waits]]' song "Burma-Shave" (from his 1977 album ''[[Foreign Affairs (Tom Waits album)|Foreign Affairs]]'') uses the signs as an allegory for an unknown destination. ("''I guess I'm headed that-a-way, Just as long as it's paved, I guess you'd say I'm on my way to Burma-Shave''") [[Chuck Suchy]]'s song "Burma Shave Boogie" (from his 2008 album ''Unraveling Heart'') incorporates several of the Burma Shave rhymes into its lyrics.

The pedestrian passageway between the [[Times Square – 42nd Street (New York City Subway)#The complex|Times Square and Port Authority Bus Terminal stations]] in the New York City subway system contains a piece of public art inspired by the Burma-Shave ads; Norman B. Colp's ''The Commuter's Lament, or A Close Shave'' consists of a series of signs attached to the roof of the passageway, displaying the following text:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Artwork: "The Commuter's Lament/A Close Shave", Norman B. Colp (1991) | url = http://www.nycsubway.org/perl/artwork_show?185 | accessdate = 22 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:Overslept, / So tired. / If late, / Get fired. / Why bother? / Why the pain? / Just go home / Do it again.

Several highway departments in the United States use signs in the same style to dispense travel safety advice to motorists.

Several writers of doggerel and humorously bad poetry (such as [[David Burge]]), often use "Burma Shave" on the last line of their poems to indicate their non-serious nature.

[[Randall Munroe|Randal Munroe]] author of [[xkcd]] published [https://xkcd.com/491/ xkcd: Twitter]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://xkcd.com/491/|title=xkcd: Twitter|website=xkcd.com|access-date=2018-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; referencing the rhyme pattern of Burma-Shave.

'''Caseless ammunition''' is a type of [[small arms]] [[ammunition]] that eliminates the [[cartridge (firearms)|cartridge]] case that typically holds the primer, propellant, and projectile together as a unit.

Caseless ammunition is an attempt to reduce the weight and cost of ammunition by dispensing with the case, which is typically precision made of [[brass]] or [[steel]], as well as to simplify the operation of repeating firearms by eliminating the need to extract and eject the empty case after firing.&lt;ref name="explosives"&gt;{{cite book |title=Explosives |last1=Meyer |first1=Rudolf |last2=Köhler |first2=Josef |last3=Homburg |first3=Axel |publisher= Wiley-VCH |date=2007| isbn=978-3-527-31656-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its acceptance has been hampered by problems with production expenses, heat sensitivity, sealing, and fragility. Its use to date has been limited to prototypes and low-powered firearms.

==History==
[[File:Rocket-Ball.JPG|thumb|Volcanic .41 cartridge]]
An early predecessor to modern caseless ammunition, [[Walter Hunt (inventor)|Walter Hunt]]'s [[Rocket Ball]] cartridge, was developed in 1850s and guns using them were sold during that time, primarily by [[Volcanic Repeating Arms]]. These cartridges were severely under-powered and never saw wide acceptance for self-protection, hunting, or military use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://winchestercollector.org/?s=volcanic|title=volcanic - Search Results  - Winchester Collector|author=|date=|website=winchestercollector.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

During [[World War II]], Germany began an intensive program to research and develop a practical caseless ammunition for military use, which was driven by the rising scarcity of metals, especially copper used to make cartridge cases. The Germans had some success, but not sufficient to produce a caseless cartridge system during the war.&lt;ref name="cotw10"&gt;{{cite book |title=Cartridges of the World|edition=10th |publisher=Krause Publications |last=Barnes |first=Frank C. |editor1-first=Stan |editor1-last=Skinner |isbn=0-87349-605-1 |page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Japan successfully developed the [[Ho-301 cannon|Ho-301]] 40mm autocannon during the war for mounting on aircraft. It saw active, though relatively limited, use in the defense of the Japanese home islands during the waning months of the war.

==Modern caseless ammunition==
[[File:473and223.png|thumb|upright|Comparison of .223 (5.56 mm) Remington (left) and 4.73 mm caseless (right)]]
Modern caseless ammunition consists of a solid mass of propellant (originally [[nitrocellulose]]) cast to form the body of the cartridge.  Cavities exist in the body to accept the bullet and a primer (both of which are glued into place). The completed cartridge might also contain a booster charge of powdered propellant to help ignite the body and provide initial thrust to the bullet.&lt;ref name="explosives"/&gt;

Many caseless cartridges are also [[telescoped ammunition|telescoped]], with the bulk of the bullet held within the body of the cartridge, to cut down on cartridge length. A shorter cartridge cuts down on the distance the firearm's action must reciprocate to load a new round, which allows for higher cyclic rates and greater probability of multiple hits on a target at long range. Lack of a case also reduces the weight of the cartridge substantially, especially in small bore rifles. For example, the caseless ammunition designed by Austrian inventor Hubert Usel (1926—2010) for the [[Voere VEC-91]] weighs about one third as much as regular ammunition for the same caliber.&lt;ref name="voere"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.voere.com/firearms.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080613193217/http://www.voere.com/firearms.htm |archivedate=2008-06-13 |title=Voere |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="brassey"&gt;{{cite book |title=Brassey's Encyclopedia of Land Forces and Warfare |last=Margiotta |first=Franklin D. |publisher=Brassey's |date=1997 |isbn=9781574880878}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wounds"&gt;{{cite book |title=Gunshot Wounds |last=DiMaio |first=Vincent J.M. |publisher=CRC Press |date=1998 |isbn=978-0-8493-8163-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Issues and practical considerations==
While it seems a simple operation to replace the case with a piece of solid propellant, the cartridge case provides more than just a way to keep the cartridge components together, and these other functions must be replaced if the case is to be replaced. Caseless ammunition is not without its drawbacks, and it is these drawbacks that have kept modern caseless ammunition from achieving wider success.

===Heat sensitivity===
The first major problem, of special concern in military applications, which often involve sustained firing, is the heat sensitivity of the ammunition. Nitrocellulose, the primary component of modern [[gunpowder]], ignites at a relatively low temperature of around 170&amp;nbsp;°C (338&amp;nbsp;°F). One of the functions of the metallic cartridge case is as a [[heat sink]]; when extracted after firing, every metallic case carries away a significant amount of the heat from the combustion of the propellant, slowing the rate at which heat builds up in the chamber. The thermal insulation provided by the case also works the other way around, shielding the propellant from built-up heat in the chamber walls.

Without a case to provide these functions, caseless rounds using nitrocellulose will begin to [[Cooking off|cook off]], firing from the residual chamber heat, much sooner than cased cartridges do. Cooking off can be avoided by designing the weapon to [[Open bolt|fire from an open bolt]], but this greatly impacts accuracy, and thus is only suitable for [[machine gun]]s and [[submachine gun]]s.

The normal solution to the problem of heat is to increase the heat resistance by switching to a propellant with a higher ignition temperature, typically a non-crystalline explosive carefully formulated to provide an appropriate rate of combustion.&lt;ref name="explosives" /&gt;&lt;ref name="brassey"/&gt; [[Heckler &amp; Koch]], in concert with [[Dynamit Nobel]], managed such a task by producing relatively heat-resistant caseless ammunition.

===Sealing===
Another important function provided by the cartridge is to seal the rear of the chamber. During firing of a cased cartridge, the pressure in the chamber expands the metallic case which [[Obturation|obturates]] to the chamber. This prevents gas exiting from the rear of the chamber, and it has also been experimentally shown to provide a significant amount of support to the bolt. Without the case to provide this seal, the firearm design must account for this and provide a means of sealing the rear of the chamber. This problem was also encountered with the [[Dreyse needle gun]]; the French [[Chassepot]] solved the leaking-breech problem with the addition of a [[rubber]] seal to the bolt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Handbook for Shooters &amp; Reloaders |volume=I |last=Ackley |first=P.O.|publisher=Plaza Publishing |date=1962 |isbn=978-99929-4-881-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See main article, [[Chassepot]], for references&lt;/ref&gt;

Telescoping caseless rounds must also deal with the issue of blocking the bore, as the bullet is surrounded by propellant. The booster charge is used to address this issue, providing an initial burst of pressure to force the bullet out of the cartridge body and into the barrel before the body combusts.&lt;ref name="wounds"/&gt;

===Fragility===
Caseless rounds are limited by the fact that the cartridge body is primarily a propellant, and structural properties are secondary to the combustion properties. The primary issue is one of extraction. While caseless ammunition eliminates the need to extract a fired case, unfired caseless rounds must be extractable to unload the firearm or to clear a misfire. With metallic cases, this ability is provided by a [[Rim (firearms)|rim]] or extractor groove machined into the rear of the case. Even in completely [[plastic]] bodied cartridges, such as the ''Activ'' brand [[shotgun shell]]s, a thin metal ring is molded into the rim to provide support for the extractor.&lt;ref name="cotw10"/&gt;&lt;ref name="brassey"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wounds"/&gt;  A secondary issue is that ammunition in use can be exposed to air, water, lubricants, and solvents. Primer and propellant in caseless rounds is unprotected, while cartridge cases provide a high degree of protection.

==Modern caseless firearms==
{{main article|List of caseless firearms}}

One of the first caseless firearm and ammunition systems produced was made by [[Daisy Outdoor Products|Daisy]], the [[airgun]] maker, in 1968. The [[Daisy V/L]] Rifle used a .22 caliber (5.5&amp;nbsp;mm) low-powered caseless round with no primer. The rifle was basically a spring-piston air rifle, but when used with the V/L ammunition the energy from the compression of the piston heated the air behind the caseless cartridge enough to ignite the propellant, and this generated the bulk of the energy of firing. The [[Daisy V/L]] Rifle system was discontinued  in 1969 after the [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives|ATF]] ruled that it was not an airgun, but a firearm, which Daisy was not licensed to produce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Blue Book of Gun Values|edition=13th |last=Fjestad |first=S. P. |publisher=Blue Book Publications}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some [[assault rifle]]s have used caseless ammunition. One of the better-known weapons of this type is the [[Heckler &amp; Koch G11|G11]] made by [[Heckler &amp; Koch]] as a potential replacement for the [[Heckler &amp; Koch G3|G3 battle rifle]]. Although the G11 never entered full production, it went through a number of prototype stages as well as field testing, including testing as part of the American [[Advanced Combat Rifle]] program. While it was scheduled to be adopted by the West German military with a plan set out to procure 300,000 G11K2 rifles over a period from 1990 to 2002, the expenses created by the [[reunification of Germany]] and the impossibility of modifying the G11 to use NATO-standard ammunition led to the cancellation of the G11 project and the adoption of a cheaper, more conventional NATO-standardised assault rifle, the 5.56{{nbsp}}mm [[Heckler &amp; Koch G36|G36]]. The G11's caseless ammunition was later used as the basis for the caseless round development in the US [[Lightweight Small Arms Technologies]] program.

The first commercial caseless rifle featuring [[electronic firing]] was the [[Voere VEC-91]].&lt;ref name="voere"/&gt;

Several Russian grenade launchers use caseless ammunition including the [[GP-25]] under-barrel grenade launcher and the [[AGS‑40 Balkan]] [[automatic grenade launcher]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.armyrecognition.com/weapons_defence_industry_military_technology_uk/new_ags-40_balkan_40mm_automatic_grenade_launcher_will_enter_in_service_with_russian_army_tass_11311161.html|title=New AGS-40 Balkan 40mm automatic grenade launcher will enter in service with Russian army TASS 11311161 - weapons defence industry military technology UK - analysis focus army defence military industry army|first=|last=Administrator|date=|website=www.armyrecognition.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Balkan1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lenta.ru/news/2013/02/18/balkan/|title=Lenta.ru: Оружие: Вооружение: Россия вооружится новым крупнокалиберным гранатометом|publisher=Lenta.ru |language=Russian|accessdate=21 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Balkan2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://world.guns.ru/grenade/rus/balkan-e.html|title=Modern Firearms|publisher=World.guns.ru|accessdate=21 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2016, they announced the acquisition of [[Eat Sleep Play]], the developer best known for Twisted Metal, also in Salt Lake City UT. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2016-11-02-castar-adds-entire-eat-sleep-play-dev-team-to-utah-studio&lt;/ref&gt; 

In December 2016, Parkis, who had been President and COO, was named CEO to replace Rodriguez.  &lt;ref&gt;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/castar-by-technical-illusions#/entity&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Century egg''' or '''Pidan''' ({{zh|s={{linktext|皮蛋}}|p=pídàn}}), also known as '''preserved egg''', '''hundred-year egg''', '''thousand-year egg''', '''thousand-year-old egg''', '''millennium egg, skin egg''' and '''black egg''', is a [[Chinese cuisine|Chinese]] preserved food product and [[delicacy]] made by preserving [[duck egg|duck]], [[chicken egg|chicken]] or [[quail eggs]] in a mixture of [[clay]], [[wood ash|ash]], [[salt]], [[Calcium oxide|quicklime]], and [[rice hulls]] for several weeks to several months, depending on the method of processing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Moskvitch|first=Katia|title=Black eggs and ripe guava lead Taiwan's tech revolution|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-21929307|accessdate=29 March 2013|newspaper=BBC News|date=29 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through the process, the [[Egg yolk|yolk]] becomes a dark green to grey color, with a creamy consistency and strong flavor due to the [[hydrogen sulfide]] and [[ammonia]] present, while the [[Egg white|white]] becomes a dark brown, translucent jelly with a salty flavor. The transforming agent in the century egg is an [[base (chemistry)|alkaline]] [[Salt (chemistry)|salt]], which gradually raises the [[pH]] of the egg to around 9–12, during the curing process.&lt;ref name="McGee117"&gt;{{Cite book |last=McGee |first=Harold |authorlink=Harold McGee |title=On Food and Cooking: The Science and Lore of the Kitchen |publisher=Scribner |year=2004 |isbn=0-684-80001-2 |page=117}}&lt;/ref&gt; This chemical process breaks down some of the complex, flavorless proteins and fats, which produces a variety of smaller flavorful compounds.

Some eggs have patterns near the surface of the egg white that are likened to [[pine]] branches, and that gives rise to one of its Chinese names, the '''pine-patterned egg'''.

==History==
The method for creating century eggs likely came about through the need to preserve eggs in times of plenty by coating them in [[alkali]]ne clay, which is similar to methods of egg preservation in some Western cultures.&lt;ref name=hou&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hou |first=Xiangchuan |year=1981 |title=Hunger and technology: Egg preservation in China |publisher=The United Nations University Press |journal=Food and Nutrition Bulletin |volume=3 |url=http://archive.unu.edu/unupress/food/8F032e/8F032E03.htm |isbn=92-808-0254-2 |issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The clay hardens around the egg and results in the curing and creation of century eggs instead of spoiled eggs.

According to some, the century egg has over five centuries of history behind its production. Its discovery, though not verifiable, was said to have occurred around 600 years ago in [[Hunan]] during the [[Ming Dynasty]], when a homeowner discovered duck eggs in a shallow pool of [[Calcium hydroxide|slaked lime]] that was used for mortar during construction of his home two months before. Upon tasting the eggs, he set out to produce more — this time with the addition of salt to improve their flavor — resulting in the present recipe of the century egg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=益阳市政府网 |title=益阳名优特产：松花皮蛋 |date=2008-07-31 |url=http://zyq.yiyang.hunancom.gov.cn/gqxx/44473.htm }}{{dead link|date=September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods==
[[Image:Century egg1.jpg|thumb|left|160px|Century egg coated in a [[Corrosive substance|caustic]] mixture of mud and rice husk]]

===Traditional===
The traditional method for producing century eggs developed through improvement of the aforementioned primitive process. Instead of using just [[clay]], a mixture of [[wood ash]], [[calcium oxide]], and [[Sodium chloride|salt]] is included in the plastering mixture, thereby increasing its [[pH]] and [[sodium]] content. The addition of calcium oxide and wood ash to the mixture lowers the risk of spoilage and also increases the speed of the process. A recipe for creating century eggs starts with the infusion of three pounds of [[Camellia sinensis|tea]] in boiling water. To the tea, three pounds of [[calcium oxide]] (or seven pounds, if done in winter), nine pounds of [[sea salt]], and seven pounds of ash from burned [[oak]] is mixed into a smooth paste. Each egg is individually covered by hand, with gloves worn to protect the skin from [[chemical burn]]s. It is then rolled in a mass of rice [[chaff]], to keep the eggs from adhering to one another, before the eggs are placed in cloth-covered [[jar]]s or tightly woven [[basket]]s. The mud slowly dries and hardens into a crust over several months. The eggs are then ready for consumption.

===Modern===
[[Image:Century egg snow flake.jpg|thumb|Century egg showing snow-flake/pine-branch (松花, sōnghuā) patterns. These patterns are [[Dendrite (crystal)|dendrites]] of various [[salt (chemistry)|salts.]]]]

Even though the traditional method is still widely practiced, modern understanding of the chemistry behind the formation of century eggs has led to many simplifications in the recipe. For instance, soaking raw eggs in a [[solution]] of [[sodium chloride|table salt]], [[calcium hydroxide]], and [[sodium carbonate]] for 10 days, followed by several weeks of aging while wrapped in plastic, is said{{by whom|date=August 2016}} to achieve the same effect as the traditional method. This is because the reaction needed to produce century eggs is accomplished by introducing [[hydroxide]] and [[sodium]] [[ions]] into the egg, regardless of the method used.

The extremely toxic compound [[lead(II) oxide]] speeds up the reactions which create century eggs, leading to its use by some unscrupulous producers.&lt;ref name=hou/&gt; However, [[zinc oxide]] is now the recommended alternative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last = Chen | first = JrWei | last2=Su |first2=HouPin| title = A new process for preparing spots-free pidan | journal =Journal of the Chinese Society of Animal Science |volume=33 |pages = 79–88 |year=2004 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although zinc is essential for life, excessive zinc consumption can lead to [[copper deficiency]], so the finished product should have its zinc level assessed for safety.

==Uses==
[[Image:Arranged century egg on a plate.jpg|180px|thumb|left|Arranged century egg on a plate]]
[[File:CenturyEgg.JPG|right|180px|thumb|Century egg with congee]]

Century eggs can be eaten without further preparation than peeling and rinsing them -- on their own, or as a side dish. As an ''[[hors d'œuvre]]'', the Cantonese wrap chunks of this egg with slices of pickled [[ginger|ginger root]] (sometimes sold on a stick as [[street food]]). A Shanghainese recipe mixes chopped century eggs with chilled [[tofu]]. In Taiwan, it is popular to eat sliced century eggs placed on top of cold [[tofu]] with ''[[katsuobushi]]'', [[soy sauce]], and [[sesame oil]], in a style similar to [[Japan]]ese ''[[hiyayakko]]''. A variation of this recipe common in northern China is to slice century eggs over chilled silken (soft) [[tofu]], adding liberal quantities of shredded young ginger and chopped spring onions as a topping, and then drizzling light soy sauce and sesame oil over the dish, to taste. They are also used in a dish called old-and-fresh eggs, where chopped century eggs are combined with (or used to top) an [[omelet]] made with fresh eggs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Billy |url=http://www.atablefortwo.com.au/2009/03/23/three-emperor-egg-%E4%B8%89%E7%9A%87%E8%9B%8B/ |title=Three Emperor Egg |publisher=Atablefortwo.com.au |date= |accessdate=2012-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The century eggs may also be cut into chunks and stir fried with vegetables, which is most commonly found in Taiwanese cuisine.

Some Chinese households cut them up into small chunks and cook them with rice porridge to create "century egg and lean pork ''[[congee]]''" ({{zh|c=皮蛋瘦肉粥|p=pídàn shòuròu zhōu}}). This is sometimes served in [[dim sum]] restaurants. Rice congee, lean pork, and century egg are the main ingredients. Peeled century eggs are cut into quarters or eighths and simmered with the seasoned marinated lean slivers of pork until both ingredients are cooked into the rice congee. Fried dough sticks known as ''[[youtiao]]'' are commonly eaten with century egg congee. Another common variation of this dish is the addition of [[salted duck egg]]s into the congee mixture.

At special events like [[wedding reception|wedding banquets]] or birthday parties, a first course platter of sliced [[Char siu|barbecued pork]], [[Pickling|pickled]] [[leek|baby leeks]], sliced [[abalone]], [[Pickling|pickled]] [[Julienning|julienned]] [[carrot]]s, [[pickled]] [[Julienning|julienned]] [[Daikon|daikon radish]], [[Jellyfish as food|seasoned julienned jellyfish]], sliced [[pork]], [[head cheese]] and the quartered century eggs is served. This is called a ''lahng-poon'' in [[Cantonese]], which simply means "cold dish".

==Misconception and etymology==
[[File:Century eggs for sale in Hong Kong by tracyhunter.jpg|thumb|right|Century eggs for sale in Mainland China.]]

According to a [[List of common misconceptions#Food and cooking|common misconception]], century eggs are, or were once, prepared by soaking eggs in [[horse]] [[urine]]. The myth may have arisen from the urine-like odor of [[ammonia]] and other [[amines]] produced by the [[chemical reaction]] used to make century eggs.&lt;ref&gt;Helmenstine, Anne Marie. "[http://chemistry.about.com/b/2008/10/16/are-century-eggs-soaked-in-horse-urine.htm Are Century Eggs Soaked in Horse Urine?]" ''[[About.com]]''. Thursday 16 October 2008. Retrieved on 20 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; However, this myth is unfounded as horse urine has a [[pH]] ranging from 7.5 to 7.9 and therefore would not work for this process.&lt;ref name="equineUrine"&gt;{{cite journal |pages=118–21 |doi=10.1111/j.2042-3306.1990.tb04222.x |title=Equine urine pH: Normal population distributions and methods of acidification |year=1990 |last1=Wood |first1=T. |last2=Weckman |first2=T.

In Thai and [[Lao language|Lao]], the common word for century egg translates to "horse urine egg", due to the distinctive urine-like odor of the delicacy:
*{{lang-th|ไข่เยี่ยวม้า}} {{IPA-th|kʰàj jîaw máː|}} ([[Royal Thai General System of Transcription|RTGS]]: ''khai yiao ma'')
*{{lang-lo|ໄຂ່ຍ່ຽວມ້າ}} {{IPA-lo|kʰāj ɲīaw mâː|}}

==Safety==
Heavy metals were used to speed up the process to turn more profit for less time and artificially increase the quality of the preserved egg.  It was an unscrupulous practice in some small factories but it became rampant in China and forced many honest manufacturers to label their boxes "Lead Free" after the scandal went mainstream in 2013.  Many production factories in China were using industrial quality [[copper sulphate]] which was contaminated with [[arsenic]], [[lead]], [[cadmium]], and other heavy metals and toxic chemicals, to make eggs more translucent, lessen odor, provide smoother texture and encourage faster curing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/unless-you-like-toxic-chemicals-skip-this-chinese-delicacy-696090/|title=Unless You Like Toxic Chemicals, Skip This Chinese Delicacy|first=Rachel|last=Nuwer|date=|website=smithsonianmag.com|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/china/article/1261750/preserved-egg-plants-shut-toxic-chemical-scandal|title=Preserved egg companies shut in toxic chemical scandal|author=|date=|website=scmp.com|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Chinese government has recently{{when|date=July 2017}} been trying to regulate food additives and license law abiding establishments to combat the [[food safety incidents in China]] posed by bad manufacturing practice.

== History ==

'''DTRACS''' was a tracking and control system used by [[United States military]] units in [[Europe]] and [[South West Asia]] (SWA). The system is actually a commercial off the shelf (COTS) product from Omnitracs, and is in use by commercial trucking fleets throughout the world. Initially, when the system was first in use by the [[US Army]] in Europe (USAREUR), it was run through an Alcatel contract out of Paris with a [[data feed]] to the USAREUR G4 Logistics Automation Division (LAD).

After it became more heavily used, it was determined that the [[Army]] needed its own secure hub on a [[military base]] in [[Germany]]. This hub was located in [[Mannheim, Germany]] outside of [[Coleman Barracks]] at a location known as the "tank-farm". This location was chosen because it already housed other satellite hubs, one of which was for AFN.

The Land Earth Station (LES) portion of the system was maintained by a company called Data Path (which was acquired by Rockwell Collins in 2009&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rockwellcollins.com/news/page12220.html&lt;/ref&gt;). The servers that processed the messages and GPS location information through the QTRACS software were initially housed in Friedrichsfeld, [[Germany]] and maintained by the USAREUR G4 office. The G4 contracted this work out to the Titan Corporation (now owned by L3 Communications). Management of the program was eventually turned over to PEO EIS.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eis.army.mil/&lt;/ref&gt;  The servers were eventually moved to [[Kilbourne Kasserne]] in [[Schwetzingen]]. This move was made because the facility at Friedrichsfeld was not robust enough and had a poor communications path with no redundancy. The site in Schwetzingen, also known as "Site-S", had better comms and was also an official military [[Network Operations Center]] (NOC).

At its height, there were three server stacks for processing DTRACS data. One stack for European devices, another for devices in SWA and a third for receiving a split-feed from the KBR (Kellog Brown and Root) owned and operated server. While KBR had their own vehicles and server, all three systems used the same satellite for their communications. As of January 2010 the KBR solution still exists, but was moved to Ramstein Airbase.

On the military side, the system was replaced by a newer system called [[Movement Tracking System]], or MTS. The last use of DTRACS by US military personnel was in early 2007. While some devices are still used by KBR in their deployment, the military decided to switch to MTS instead of DTRACS for its [[military logistics|logistics]] tracking solution. The primary reason for the switch is that MTS provided a mapping capability in the vehicle. Of course this came at a price. A typical DTRACS device cost in the neighborhood of $2,500, while an MTS device cost approximately $20,000 or more. Further funding for MTS from the military allowed the system to have Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) included in the system. This allowed the trucks to read active ANSI and ISO18000 RFID&lt;ref&gt;[[Radio-frequency identification]]&lt;/ref&gt; tags that were included in its cargo and report live locations back to the Radio Frequency - In-Transit Visibility (RF-ITV) system maintained by PEO EIS Product Director Automated Movement and Identification Solutions (PD AMIS)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eis.army.mil/programs/amis&lt;/ref&gt;

== Capabilities ==

DTRACS devices were capable of sending messages to each other and their dispatchers. The dispatchers used either a DTRACS device in a box (referred to as a "Fly Away Kit" or FAK) or online software (QTRACS) to send and receive messages from the drivers. While the DTRACS FAK only allowed limited communications, the QTRACS software allowed the dispatcher to see all communications they sent to and from their trucks as well as their assigned vehicles "truck to truck" messages. It also provided topographical maps, and where necessary, satellite imagery provided by NIMA (now NGA).

Vehicles could send free text messages containing up to 1,900 characters. There were all preformatted or 'canned' messages where the driver only needed to fill in blank fields and hit send. Such messages included NBC1 reports, NEDIVAC message and arrival and departure messages among others.

A '''dental prosthesis''' is an intraoral (inside the [[mouth]]) [[prosthesis]] used to [[dental restoration|restore]] (reconstruct) intraoral defects such as missing [[tooth|teeth]], missing parts of [[teeth]], and missing soft or hard structures of the [[jaw]] and [[palate]]. [[Prosthodontics]] is the dental specialty that focuses on dental prostheses. Such prostheses are used to rehabilitate [[mastication]] (chewing), improve aesthetics, and aid speech. A dental prosthesis may be held in place by connecting to teeth or [[dental implant]]s, by suction, or by being held passively by surrounding muscles.  Like other types of prostheses, they can either be fixed permanently or removable; [[fixed prosthodontics]] and removable [[dentures]] are made in many variations. Permanently fixed dental prostheses use dental adhesive or screws, to attach to teeth or dental implants. Removal prostheses may use friction against parallel hard surfaces and undercuts of adjacent teeth or dental implants, suction using the mucous retention (with or without aid from denture adhesives), and by exploiting the surrounding muscles and anatomical contours of the jaw to passively hold in place. 
==Examples==

Some examples of dental prostheses include:

* [[dentures]]
* [[partial denture]]
* [[palatal obturator]]
* [[orthodontic technology|orthodontic appliance]]
* [[dental implant]]
* [[crown (dentistry)|crown]]
* [[bridge (dentistry)|bridge]]

''' Design history ''' is the study of objects of design in their historical and stylistic contexts.

With a broad definition, the contexts of design history include the social, the cultural, the economic, the political, the technical and the aesthetic. Design history has as its objects of study all designed objects including those of [[architecture]], [[fashion]], [[crafts]], [[interiors]], [[textiles]], [[graphic design]], [[industrial design]] and [[product design]].

Design history has had to incorporate criticism of the 'heroic' structure of its discipline, in response to the establishment of [[material culture]], much as [[art history]] has had to respond to [[visual culture]], (although visual culture has been able to broaden the subject area of art history through the incorporation of the televisual, film and new media). Design history has done this by shifting its focus towards the acts of production and consumption.

== Design history as a component of British practice-based courses ==

Design history also exists as a component of many practice-based courses.

The teaching and study of design history within art and design programs in Britain are one of the results of the National Advisory Council on Art Education in the 1960s. Among its aims was making art and design education a legitimate academic activity, to which ends a historical perspective was introduced. This necessitated the employment or ‘buying in’ of specialists from art history disciplines, leading to a particular style of delivery: “Art historians taught in the only way that art historians knew how to teach;  they switched off the lights, turned on the slide projector, showed slides of art and design objects, discussed and evaluated them and asked (art and design) students to write essays – according to the scholarly conventions of academia”.&lt;ref&gt;Raein, M. (2005). "Integration of studio and theory in the teaching of graphic design." Art, Design &amp; Communication in Higher Education 3(3): 163–174&lt;/ref&gt;

The most obvious effect of the traditional approach design history as sequential, in which X begat Y and Y begat Z. This has pedagogical implications in that the realization that assessment requires a fact-based regurgitation of received knowledge leads students to ignore discussions of the situations surrounding a design’s creation and reception and to focus instead on simple facts such as who designed what and when.

This 'heroic/aesthetic' view – the idea that there are a few great designers who should be studied and revered unquestioningly – arguably instills an unrealistic view of the design profession. Although the design industry has been complicit in promoting the heroic view of history, the establishment of the UK government of [[Creative &amp; Cultural Skills]] has led to calls for design courses to be made less 'academic' and more attuned to the 'needs' of the industry. Design history, as a component of design courses, is under increasing threat in the UK at least and it has been argued that its survival depends on an increased focus on the study of the processes and effects of design rather than the lives of designers themselves.

Ultimately it appears that design history for practice-based courses is rapidly becoming a branch of social and cultural studies, leaving behind its art historical roots. This has led to a great deal of debate as the two approaches forge distinct pedagogical approaches and philosophies.

=== Debates over the merits of different approaches to teaching design history on practice-based courses ===

The debate over the best way to approach the teaching of design history to practice-based students is often heated, but it is notable that the biggest push to adopt a 'realistic' approach (i.e. non-hero-based, analysing the production and consumption of design that would otherwise be viewed as ephemeral) comes from teachers delivering these programmes, while critics are predominantly those who teach 'pure' design history courses.

The biggest criticism of the 'realistic' approach appears to be that it imposes anonymity on designers, while the counter argument is that the vast majority of designers ''are'' anonymous and that it is the uses and users of design that are more important.

The research literature suggests that, contrary to critics' predictions of the death of design history, this realistic approach is beneficial. Baldwin and McLean at the University of Brighton (now at the University of Dundee and Edinburgh College of Art respectively) reported attendance figures for courses using this model rising dramatically,&lt;ref&gt;Baldwin, J and McLean, S "Abandoning History: delivering historical and critical studies to practice-based students" at the New Views conference, LCC 29 October 2005. [http://www.jonathanbaldwin.co.uk/assets/AbandoningHistory.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; and improved interest in the subject, as did Rain at Central St. Martin's. This compares with the often-reported low attendance and low grades of practice-based students facing the 'death by slideshow' model.

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9541">In [[computer programming]], a '''directive''' or '''pragma''' (from "pragmatic") is a [[language construct]] that specifies how a [[compiler]] (or other [[Translator (computing)|translator]]) should process its input. Directives are not part of the [[Formal grammar|grammar]] of a [[programming language]], and may vary from compiler to compiler.  They can be processed by a [[preprocessor]] to specify compiler behavior, or function as a form of [[In-band signaling|in-band]] parameterization.

In some cases directives specify global behavior, while in other cases they only affect a local section, such as a block of programming code. In some cases, such as some C programs, directives are optional compiler hints, and may be ignored, but normally they are prescriptive, and must be followed. However, a directive does not perform any action in the language itself, but rather only a change in the behavior of the compiler.

This term could be used to refer to proprietary third party tags and commands (or markup) embedded in code that result in additional executable processing that extend the existing compiler, assembler and language constructs present in the development environment. The term "directive" is also applied in a variety of ways that are similar to the term ''command''.

==The C preprocessor==
{{Main|C preprocessor}}

In [[C (programming language)|C]] and [[C++]], the language supports a simple [[Macro (computer science)|macro]] [[preprocessor]]. Source lines that should be handled by the preprocessor, such as &lt;code&gt;#define&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;#include&lt;/code&gt; are referred to as ''preprocessor directives''.

Another C construct, the &lt;code&gt;#pragma&lt;/code&gt; directive, is used to instruct the compiler to use pragmatic or implementation-dependent features. Two notable users of this directive are [[OpenMP]] and [[OpenACC]].

Syntactic constructs similar to C's preprocessor directives, such as [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]]'s &lt;code&gt;#if&lt;/code&gt;, are also typically called "directives", although in these cases there may not be any real preprocessing phase involved.

All preprocessor commands begin with a hash symbol (#).

Directives date to [[ALGOL 68]], where they are known as [[ALGOL 68#pr .26 co: Pragmats and Comments|pragmats]] (from "pragmatic"), and denoted '''pragmat''' or '''pr'''; in newer languages, notably C, this has been abbreviated to "pragma" (no 't').

A common use of pragmats in ALGOL 68 is in specifying a [[Stropping (syntax)|stropping]] regime, meaning "how keywords are indicated". Various such directives follow, specifying the POINT, UPPER, RES (reserved), or quote regimes. Note the use of stropping for the '''pragmat''' keyword itself (abbreviated '''pr'''), either in the POINT or quote regimes:
 .PR POINT .PR
 .PR UPPER .PR
 .PR RES .PR
 'pr' quote 'pr'

Today directives are best known in the C language, of early 1970s vintage, and continued through the current [[C99]] standard, where they are either instructions to the [[C preprocessor]], or, in the form of &lt;code&gt;#pragma&lt;/code&gt;, directives to the compiler itself. They are also used to some degree in more modern languages; see below.

==Other languages==
* In [[Ada (programming language)|Ada]], compiler directives are called '''pragmas''' (short for "pragmatic information").
* In [[Common Lisp]], directives are called '''declarations''', and are specified using the &lt;code&gt;declare&lt;/code&gt; construct (also &lt;code&gt;proclaim&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;declaim&lt;/code&gt;).{{sfn|Steele|1990|loc=[http://www.cs.cmu.edu/Groups/AI/html/cltl/clm/node103.html Chapter 9: Declarations], p. 215–237}} With one exception, declarations are optional, and do not affect the semantics of the program. The one exception is &lt;code&gt;special&lt;/code&gt;, which must be specified where appropriate.
* In [[Turbo Pascal]], directives are called '''significant comments''', because in the language [[grammar]] they follow the same syntax as [[comment (computer programming)|comment]]s. In Turbo Pascal, a significant comment is a comment whose first character is a [[dollar sign]] and whose second character is a letter; for example, the equivalent of C's &lt;code&gt;#include "file"&lt;/code&gt; directive is the significant comment &lt;code&gt;{$I "file"}&lt;/code&gt;.
* In [[Perl]], the [[keyword (computer programming)|keyword]] "&lt;code&gt;[http://perldoc.perl.org/functions/use.html use]&lt;/code&gt;", which imports modules, can also be used to specify directives, such as &lt;code&gt;use strict;&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;use utf8;&lt;/code&gt;.
* [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]] pragmas are specified using a specialized comment syntax, e.g. &lt;code&gt;{-# INLINE foo #-}&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=7.20. Pragmas|url=http://www.haskell.org/ghc/docs/7.8.3/html/users_guide/pragmas.html|website=GHC 7.8.3 Documentation|accessdate=18 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Python (programming language)|Python]] has two directives – &lt;code&gt;from __future__ import feature&lt;/code&gt; (defined in [https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0236/ PEP 236 -- Back to the __future__]), which changes language features (and uses the existing module import syntax, as in Perl), and the &lt;code&gt;coding&lt;/code&gt; directive (in a comment) to specify the encoding of a source code file (defined in [https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0263/ PEP 263 -- Defining Python Source Code Encodings]). A more general directive statement was proposed and rejected in [https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0244/ PEP 244 -- The `directive' statement]; these all date to 2001.
* [[ECMAScript]] also adopts the &lt;code&gt;use&lt;/code&gt; syntax for directives, with the difference that pragmas are declared as string literals (e.g. &lt;code&gt;"use strict";&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code&gt;"use asm";&lt;/code&gt;), rather than a function call.
*In [[Visual Basic]], the keyword "&lt;code&gt;Option&lt;/code&gt;" is used for directives:
** &lt;code&gt;Option Explicit On|Off&lt;/code&gt; - When on disallows implicit declaration of variables at first use requiring explicit declaration beforehand. 
** &lt;code&gt;Option Compare Binary&lt;/code&gt; - Results in string comparisons based on a sort order derived from the internal binary representations of the characters - e.g. for the English/European code page (ANSI 1252) A &lt; B &lt; E &lt; Z &lt; a &lt; b &lt; e &lt; z &lt; À &lt; Ê &lt; Ø &lt; à &lt; ê &lt; ø. Affects intrinsic operators (e.g. =, &lt;&gt;, &lt;, &gt;), the Select Case block, and VB runtime library string functions (e.g. InStr).
** &lt;code&gt;Option Compare Text&lt;/code&gt; - Results in string comparisons based on a case-insensitive text sort order determined by your system's locale - e.g. for the English/European code page (ANSI 1252) (A=a) &lt; (À = à) &lt; (B=b) &lt; (E=e) &lt; (Ê = ê) &lt; (Z=z) &lt; (Ø = ø). Affects intrinsic operators (e.g. =, &lt;&gt;, &lt;, &gt;), the Select Case block, and VB runtime library string functions (e.g. InStr).
** &lt;code&gt;Option Strict On|Off&lt;/code&gt; - When on disallows:
*** typeless programming - where declarations which lack an explicit type are implicitly typed as Object.
*** late-binding (i.e. dynamic dispatch to CLR, DLR, and COM objects) on values statically typed as Object.
*** implicit narrowing conversions - requiring all conversions to narrower types (e.g. from  Long to Integer, Object to String, Control to TextBox) be explicit in code using conversion operators (e.g. CInt, DirectCast, CType).
** &lt;code&gt;Option Infer On|Off&lt;/code&gt; - When on enables the compiler to infer the type of local variables from their initializers.
* In [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]], interpreter directives are referred to as '''pragmas''' and are specified by top-of-file comments that follow a &lt;code&gt;key: value&lt;/code&gt; notation. For example, &lt;code&gt;coding: UTF-8&lt;/code&gt; indicates that the file is encoded via the [[UTF-8]] [[character encoding]].

===Assembly language===
* In [[assembly language]], directives, also referred to as pseudo-operations or "pseudo-ops", generally specify such information as the target machine, mark separations between code sections, invoke macros, define reserved memory areas, and so on.  Assemblers use a specific syntax to differentiate pseudo-ops from instruction mnemonics, such as prefacing the pseudo-op with a period, such as the pseudo-op &lt;code&gt;.END&lt;/code&gt;, which might direct the assembler to stop assembling code.

===PL/SQL===
* [[Oracle Corporation]]'s [[PL/SQL]] procedural language includes a set of compiler directives, known as "pragmas".&lt;ref&gt;

'''Fortras''' (''Forschungs und Entwicklungsgesellschaft für Transportwesen'' or: ''Research and Development Corporation for the Transportation Sector'') is an [[Electronic data interchange|EDI]] standard for [[data exchange]] between [[Telephone company|carriers]].

Fortras was the designation of an independent company until 2001, when it merged with System Alliance. The designation 'Fortras' is now solely used for the EDI [[Technical standard|standard]] that also is used outside of System Alliance. 

Important Fortras message types are "BORD" for [[consignment]] information (comparable to [[EDIFACT]]'s IFCSUM), "ENTL" for unloading reports from the receiving carrier, and "STAT" for status information (comparable to EDIFACT's IFTSTA).

Fortras messages consist of a sequence of lines with a fixed number of characters, e.g. 80, 128, or 512 and [[data]] elements are placed on fixed positions on each line. The document type is specified by a letter and a record number at the beginning of the line.

[[File:Belchatow-elektrownia.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|The 5,400&amp;nbsp;[[megawatt|MW]] [[Bełchatów Power Station]] in Poland – one of the [[List of coal power stations|world's largest]] coal-fired power stations.]]
{{Latest pie chart of world power by source}}
A '''fossil fuel power station''' is a [[power station]] which burns a [[fossil fuel]] such as [[coal]], [[natural gas]], or [[petroleum]] to produce [[electricity]]. Central station fossil fuel power plants are designed on a large scale for continuous operation. In many countries, such plants provide most of the [[electrical energy]] used. Fossil fuel power stations have machinery to convert the [[heat energy]] of [[combustion]] into [[mechanical energy]], which then operates an [[electrical generator]]. The [[wikt:prime mover|prime mover]] may be a [[steam turbine]], a [[gas turbine]] or, in small plants, a reciprocating [[internal combustion]] engine. All plants use the energy extracted from expanding gas, either steam or combustion gases. 
Although different energy conversion methods exist, all thermal power station conversion methods have efficiency limited by the [[Carnot efficiency]] and therefore produce [[waste heat]].

By-products of thermal power plant operation must be considered in their design and operation. Waste heat energy, which remains due to the finite efficiency, is released directly to the atmosphere or to a body of water, or indirectly to the atmosphere using a [[cooling tower]] with river or lake water used as a cooling medium. 
The [[flue gas]] from combustion of the fossil fuels is discharged to the air. 
This gas contains [[carbon dioxide]] and water vapor, as well as other substances such as [[nitrogen oxide]]s (NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;), [[sulfur oxide]]s (SO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;), [[mercury (element)|mercury]], traces of other metals, and, for coal-fired plants, [[fly ash]]. 
Solid waste ash from coal-fired boilers must also be removed. 
Some coal ash can be recycled for building materials.&lt;ref name="PCA Manual"&gt;{{cite web|title=PCA Manual|url=http://www.ce.memphis.edu/1101/notes/concrete/PCA_manual/Chap03.pdf|publisher=University of Memphis, Herff College of Civil Engineering|accessdate=8 January 2013|author=Charles Camp|author2=Department of Civil Engineering}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fossil fueled power stations are major emitters of [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), a [[greenhouse gas]] which is a major contributor to [[global warming]]. 
The results of a recent study&lt;ref&gt;N. Heidari &amp; J. M. Pearce. A Review of Greenhouse Gas Emission Liabilities as the Value of Renewable Energy for Mitigating Lawsuits for Climate Change Related Damages. ''Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews'' '''55'''C (2016) pp. 899-908. DOI:10.1016/j.rser.2015.11.025 [https://www.academia.edu/19418589/A_Review_of_Greenhouse_Gas_Emission_Liabilities_as_the_Value_of_Renewable_Energy_for_Mitigating_Lawsuits_for_Climate_Change_Related_Damages open access]&lt;/ref&gt; show that the [[net income]] available to shareholders of large companies could see a significant reduction from the [[greenhouse gas emissions]] liability related to only natural disasters in the United States from a single coal-fired power plant. 
However, as of 2015, no such cases have awarded damages in the United States. 
Per unit of electric energy, [[brown coal]] emits nearly two times as much CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as natural gas, and black coal emits somewhat less than brown. 
[[Carbon capture and storage]] of emissions has been proposed to limit the environmental impact of fossil fuel power stations, but it is still at a demonstration stage.

==Basic concepts==
In a fossil fuel power plant the chemical energy stored in fossil fuels such as [[coal]], [[fuel oil]], [[natural gas]] or [[oil shale]] and [[oxygen]] of the [[air]] is converted successively into [[thermal energy]], [[mechanical energy]] and, finally, [[electrical energy]]. Each fossil fuel power plant is a complex, custom-designed system. Construction costs, {{As of|2004|lc=on}}, run to [[United States dollar|US$]]1,300 per [[kilowatt]], or $650 million for a 500 [[MWe]] unit.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} Multiple generating units may be built at a single site for more efficient use of [[land use|land]], [[natural resource]]s and [[labor (economics)|labor]]. Most [[thermal power station]]s in the world use fossil fuel, outnumbering [[nuclear power|nuclear]], [[geothermal power|geothermal]], [[biomass]], or [[solar energy|solar thermal]] plants.

===Heat into mechanical energy===
The [[second law of thermodynamics]] states that any [[Thermodynamic cycle|closed-loop cycle]] can only convert a fraction of the heat produced during combustion into [[mechanical work]]. The rest of the heat, called [[waste heat]], must be released into a cooler environment during the return portion of the cycle. The fraction of heat released into a cooler medium must be equal or larger than the ratio of [[absolute temperature]]s of the cooling system (environment) and the heat source (combustion furnace). Raising the furnace temperature improves the efficiency but complicates the design, primarily by the selection of alloys used for construction, making the furnace more expensive. The waste heat cannot be converted into mechanical energy without an even cooler cooling system. However, it may be used in [[cogeneration]] plants to heat buildings, produce hot water, or to heat materials on an industrial scale, such as in some [[oil refinery|oil refineries]], plants, and [[chemical synthesis]] plants.

Typical thermal efficiency for utility-scale electrical generators is around 37% for coal and oil-fired plants&lt;ref name="Who Has the World's Most Efficient Coal Power Plant Fleet?"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.powermag.com/who-has-the-worlds-most-efficient-coal-power-plant-fleet/access-date=05 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and 56 – 60% (LEV) for [[combined-cycle]] gas-fired plants. Plants designed to achieve peak efficiency while operating at capacity will be less efficient when operating off-design (i.e. temperatures too low.)&lt;ref name="ELECTRIC GENERATION
EFFICIENCY Page 5"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.npc.org/study_topic_papers/4-dtg-electricefficiency.pdf|title=ELECTRIC GENERATION EFFICIENCY: Working Document of the NP C Global Oil &amp; Gas Study|publisher=High beam Research|access-date=18 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Practical fossil fuels stations operating as heat engines cannot exceed the [[Carnot cycle]] limit for conversion of heat energy into useful work. [[Fuel cell]]s do not have the same thermodynamic limits as they are not heat engines.

'''Temperature of Hot Steam'''.
Using the reported efficiencies and the efficiency of an ideal [[Carnot engine]] one can estimate the engine temperature. This estimate is the minimum heat water/steam temperature as we neglect other losses. For example, the effective temperature of the cooling water can be significantly higher.
Assume the cold temperature &lt;math&gt; T_c &lt;/math&gt; is 10&amp;nbsp;°C, or 280 K than &lt;math&gt; T_h &lt;/math&gt; equals:
: &lt;math&gt; \eta \,=\, 1 - \frac{T_c}{T_h} &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; T_h  \,=\, \frac{T_c}{1 - \eta} &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; T_h  \,=\, \frac{280}{1 - 0.33} &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; T_h  \,=\, 418\, {K} = 145^o {C} &lt;/math&gt;

This temperature is presumably much lower than the actual steam temperature due to several losses.

==Coal==
[[File:Coal fired power plant diagram.svg|thumb|upright=1.3|Diagram of a typical steam-cycle coal power plant (proceeding from left to right)]]
{{main|Thermal power station}}

Coal is the most abundant [[fossil fuel]] on the planet, and widely used as the source of energy in [[thermal power station]]s. It is a relatively cheap fuel, with some of the largest deposits in regions that are stable politically, such as [[China]], [[India]] and the [[United States]]. This contrasts with [[natural gas]], the largest deposits of which are located in Russia, Iran, Qatar, Turkmenistan and the US. Solid coal cannot directly replace natural gas or petroleum in most applications, petroleum is mostly used for [[transportation]] and the natural gas not used for [[electricity generation]] is used for [[space heating|space]], [[water heating|water]] and industrial heating. Coal can be converted to gas or liquid fuel, but the efficiencies and economics of such processes can make them unfeasible.{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}} Vehicles or heaters may require modification to use coal-derived fuels. Coal is an impure fuel and produces more [[greenhouse gas]] and [[pollution]] than an equivalent amount of petroleum or natural gas. For instance, the operation of a 1000-MWe coal-fired power plant results in a nuclear radiation dose of 490 person-rem/year, compared to 136 person-rem/year, for an equivalent nuclear power plant including uranium mining, reactor operation and waste disposal.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ornl.gov/sites/default/files/ORNL%20Review%20v26n3-4%201993.pdf pg28&lt;/ref&gt;

{{As of|2009}} the largest coal-fired power station is [[Taichung Power Plant]] in [[Taiwan]]. The world's most energy-efficient coal-fired power plant is the [[Avedøre Power Station]] in [[Denmark]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dongenergy.com/en/business%20activities/generation/electricity%20generation/primary%20power%20stations/pages/avedore%20power%20station.aspx Avedøre Power Station] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120225021554/http://www.dongenergy.com/en/business%20activities/generation/electricity%20generation/primary%20power%20stations/pages/avedore%20power%20station.aspx |date=25 February 2012 }} from the web page of [[DONG Energy]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fuel transport and delivery===
[[File:Grand Junction Trip 92007 098.JPG|thumb|Coal-fired power plants provide about 32 percent of consumed electricity in the United States, As of September 2017.&lt;ref&gt;Energy Information Administration&lt;/ref&gt; This is the [[Carbon Power Plant|Castle Gate Plant]] near [[Helper, Utah]].]]

Coal is delivered by highway [[truck]], [[railroad|rail]], [[barge]], [[Collier (ship type)|collier]] ship or [[coal slurry pipeline]]. Some plants are even built near coal mines and coal is delivered by conveyors. A large coal [[train]] called a "unit train" may be {{convert|2|km|mi}} long, containing 130-140 cars with around {{convert|100|tonne|ton}} of coal in each one, for a total load of over {{convert|10000|tonnes|ton}}. A large plant under full load requires at least one coal delivery this size every day. Plants may get as many as three to five trains a day, especially in "peak season" during the hottest summer or coldest winter months (depending on local climate) when power consumption is high. A large thermal power plant such as the now decommissioned [[Nanticoke Generating Station|Nanticoke]], Ontario stores several million metric tons of coal for winter use when the lakes are frozen.

Modern unloaders use rotary dump devices, which eliminate problems with coal freezing in bottom dump cars. The unloader includes a train positioner arm that pulls the entire train to position each car over a coal hopper. The dumper clamps an individual car against a platform that swivels the car upside down to dump the coal. Swiveling couplers enable the entire operation to occur while the cars are still coupled together. Unloading a unit train takes about three hours.

Shorter trains may use railcars with an "air-dump", which relies on air pressure from the engine plus a "hot shoe" on each car. This "hot shoe" when it comes into contact with a "hot rail" at the unloading trestle, shoots an electric charge through the air dump apparatus and causes the doors on the bottom of the car to open, dumping the coal through the opening in the trestle. Unloading one of these trains takes anywhere from an hour to an hour and a half. Older unloaders may still use manually operated bottom-dump rail cars and a "shaker" attached to dump the coal. Generating stations adjacent to a mine may receive coal by [[conveyor belt]] or massive [[diesel-electric]]-drive [[haul truck|trucks]].

A collier (cargo ship carrying coal) may hold 40,000 long tons of coal and takes several days to unload. Some colliers carry their own conveying equipment to unload their own bunkers; others depend on equipment at the plant. For transporting coal in calmer waters, such as rivers and lakes, flat-bottomed [[barge]]s are often used. Barges are usually unpowered and must be moved by [[tugboat]]s or [[towboat]]s.

For start up or auxiliary purposes, the plant may use fuel oil as well. Fuel oil can be delivered to plants by [[Pipeline transport|pipeline]], [[Tanker (ship)|tanker]], [[tank car]] or truck. Oil is stored in vertical cylindrical steel tanks with capacities as high as {{convert|90000|oilbbl}}' worth. The [[viscosity|heavier]] no. 5 "bunker" and no. 6 fuels are typically steam-heated before pumping in cold climates.

===Fuel processing===
Coal is prepared for use by crushing the rough coal to pieces less than {{convert|2|in|cm|sigfig=1}} in size. The coal is then transported from the storage yard to in-plant storage silos by [[conveyor belt]]s at rates up to 4,000 short tons per hour.

In plants that burn pulverized coal, silos feed coal to [[pulverizer]]s (coal mills) that take the larger {{convert|2|in|mm|adj=on}} pieces, grind them to the consistency of [[talcum powder]], sort them, and mix them with primary combustion air which transports the coal to the boiler furnace and preheats the coal in order to drive off excess moisture content. A 500 MWe plant may have six such pulverizers, five of which can supply coal to the furnace at 250 tons per hour under full load.

In plants that do not burn pulverized coal, the larger {{convert|2|in|mm|adj=on}} pieces may be directly fed into the silos which then feed either mechanical distributors that drop the coal on a traveling grate or the [[Cyclone furnace|cyclone]] burners, a specific kind of combustor that can efficiently burn larger pieces of fuel.

==Combined heat and power==
[[Combined heat and power]] (CHP), also known as [[cogeneration]], is the use of a [[thermal power station]] to provide both electric power and heat (the latter being used, for example, for [[district heating]] purposes). This technology is practiced not only for domestic heating (low temperature) but also for industrial process heat, which is often high temperature heat. Calculations show that Combined Heat and Power District Heating (CHPDH) is the cheapest method in reducing (but not eliminating) carbon emissions, if conventional fossil fuels remain to be burned.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.claverton-energy.com/carbon-footprints-of-various-sources-of-heat-chpdh-comes-out-lowest.html Claverton-energy.co.uk]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gas turbine plants==

[[File:Currant Creek Power Plant.jpg|thumb|Currant Creek Power Plant near [[Mona, Utah]] is a [[natural gas]] fired electrical plant.]]

One type of fossil fuel power plant uses a [[gas turbine]] in conjunction with a [[heat recovery steam generator]] (HRSG). It is referred to as a [[combined cycle]] power plant because it combines the [[Brayton cycle]] of the gas turbine with the [[Rankine cycle]] of the HRSG. The thermal efficiency of these plants has reached a record [[thermal efficiency|heat rate]] of 5690 Btu/(kW·h), or just under 60%, at a facility in Baglan Bay, Wales.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ge-energy.com/prod_serv/products/gas_turbines_cc/en/h_system/index.htm GE Power’s H Series Turbine] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071111004450/http://www.ge-energy.com/prod_serv/products/gas_turbines_cc/en/h_system/index.htm |date=11 November 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The turbines are fueled either with natural gas, [[syngas]] or fuel oil. While more efficient and faster to construct (a 1,000 MW plant may be completed in as little as 18 months from start of construction), the economics of such plants is heavily influenced by the volatile cost of fuel, normally natural gas. The combined cycle plants are designed in a variety of configurations composed of the number of gas turbines followed by the steam turbine. For example, a 3-1 combined cycle facility has three gas turbines tied to one steam turbine. The configurations range from (1-1), (2-1), (3-1), (4-1), (5-1), to (6-1){{Citation needed|date=January 2013}}

Simple-cycle or open cycle gas turbine plants, without a steam cycle, are sometimes installed as emergency or [[peaking power plant|peaking]] capacity; their thermal efficiency is much lower. The high running cost per hour is offset by the low capital cost and the intention to run such units only a few hundred hours per year. Other gas turbine plants are installed in stages, with an open cycle gas turbine the first stage and additional turbines or conversion to a closed cycle part of future project plans.

===Dash for gas===
The [[dash for gas]] occurred in the 1990s and was when 30 gas-fired power stations were built in [[Great Britain|Britain]] due to plentiful gas supplies from [[North Sea Gas|North Sea oil wells]]. According to the 2012 forecast by the U.S. Energy Information Administration, 27 gigawatts of capacity from coal-fired generators is to be retired from 175 US coal-fired power plants before 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Gerhardt|first=Tina|date=1 November 2012|title=Record Number of Coal Power Plants Retire|url=http://www.emagazine.com/magazine/by-the-numbers-record-number-of-coal-power-plants-retire|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121101010101/http://www.emagazine.com/magazine/by-the-numbers-record-number-of-coal-power-plants-retire|work=[[E-Magazine]]|dead-url=yes|archivedate=1 November 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Natural gas showed a corresponding jump, increasing by a third over 2011.&lt;ref name="epm_312"&gt;Electric Power Monthly, March 2011 (released May 2012), U.S. Energy Information Administration&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[Thermal power station|coal power plants]] such as the 1200 MW [[Hearn Generating Station]] have stopped burning coal by switching the plant to natural gas. Coal's share of electricity generation dropped to just over 36%.&lt;ref name="epm_312" /&gt; Natural gas accounted for 81% of new power generation in the US between 2000 and 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.cfm?id=2070 Most electric generating capacity additions in the last decade were natural gas-fired - Today in Energy - U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  Coal-fired generation puts out about twice the amount of carbon dioxide - around 2,000 pounds for every megawatt hour generated - than electricity generated by burning natural gas at 1,100 pounds of [[greenhouse gas]] per megawatt hour. As the fuel mix in the United States has changed to reduce coal and increase natural gas generation, carbon dioxide emissions have unexpectedly fallen. Carbon dioxide measured in the first quarter of 2012 was the lowest recorded of any year since 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Rachel |last=Nuwer |title=A 20-Year Low in U.S. Carbon Emissions |url=http://green.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/08/17/a-20-year-low-in-u-s-carbon-emissions/ |date=August 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[list of natural gas power stations]] has over 100 power stations that generate between 100 MW and 5,600 MW of electricity. Natural gas plants are increasing in popularity and in 2014 generated 22% of the worlds total electricity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/KeyWorld2014.pdf pg24 Free publications&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reciprocating engines==
[[Diesel engine]] generator sets are often used for prime power in communities not connected to a widespread power grid. Emergency (standby) power systems may use reciprocating internal combustion engines operated by fuel oil or natural gas. Standby generators may serve as emergency power for a factory or data center, or may also be operated in parallel with the local utility system to reduce peak power demand charge from the utility. Diesel engines can produce strong torque at relatively low rotational speeds, which is generally desirable when driving an [[alternator]], but diesel fuel in long-term storage can be subject to problems resulting from water accumulation and [[chemical decomposition]]. Rarely used generator sets may correspondingly be installed as natural gas or LPG to minimize the fuel system maintenance requirements.

Spark-ignition internal combustion engines operating on gasoline (petrol), [[propane]], or [[Liquefied petroleum gas|LPG]] are commonly used as portable temporary power sources for construction work, emergency power, or recreational uses.

Reciprocating external combustion engines such as the [[Stirling engine]] can be run on a variety of fossil fuels, as well as renewable fuels or industrial waste heat. Installations of Stirling engines for power production are relatively uncommon.

==Environmental impacts==

Thermal power plants are one of the main artificial sources of producing toxic gases and [[particulate matter]]. Fossil fuel power plants cause the emission of pollutants such as NOx, SOx, CO2, CO, PM, organic gases and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.&lt;ref name=FouladiFard05&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fouladi Fard|first1=Reza. |last2= Naddafi |first2= K.|last3= Yunesian |first3=M. | last4= Nabizadeh Nodehi |first4=R. et al.|title=The assessment of health impacts and external costs of natural gas-fired power plant of Qom|journal= Environmental Science and Pollution Research |volume=23 |issue=20 |pages= 20922–20936 |date= 2016|url= https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs11356-016-7258-0.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; World organizations and international agencies, like the IEA, are concerned about the [[Environmental impact of fossil fuels|environmental impact of burning fossil fuels]], and coal in particular. The combustion of coal contributes the most to [[acid rain]] and [[air pollution]], and has been connected with [[global warming]]. Due to the chemical composition of coal there are difficulties in removing impurities from the solid fuel prior to its combustion. Modern day coal power plants pollute less than older designs due to new "[[scrubber]]" technologies that filter the exhaust air in smoke stacks; however emission levels of various pollutants are still on average several times greater than natural gas power plants. In these modern designs, pollution from coal-fired power plants comes from the emission of gases such as carbon dioxide, [[nitrogen oxides]], and [[sulfur dioxide]] into the air.

Acid rain is caused by the emission of [[nitrogen oxides]] and [[sulfur dioxide]]. These gases may be only mildly acidic themselves, yet when they react with the atmosphere, they create acidic compounds such as [[sulfurous acid]], [[nitric acid]] and [[sulfuric acid]] which fall as rain, hence the term acid rain. In Europe and the U.S.A., stricter emission laws and decline in heavy industries have reduced the environmental hazards associated with this problem, leading to lower emissions after their peak in 1960s.

===Carbon dioxide===
{{Main|Carbon dioxide}}
[[File:Taichung Thermal Power Plant.JPG|thumb|[[Taichung Power Plant|Taichung coal-fired power plant]] in [[Taiwan]], the world's largest carbon dioxide emitter&lt;ref&gt;[http://thephoenixsun.com/archives/6548 The Phoenix Sun | Dirty numbers | The 200 Most Polluting Power Plants in the World&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Electricity generation using carbon-based fuels is responsible for a large fraction of carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) emissions worldwide and for 34% of U.S. man-made carbon dioxide emissions in 2010. In the U.S. 70% of electricity is generated by combustion of fossil fuels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url= http://www.epa.gov/climatechange/ghgemissions/sources.html
|title=Sources Climate Change
|work= US EPA
|year=2012
|accessdate=August 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coal contains more carbon than oil or natural gas fossil fuels, resulting in greater volumes of carbon dioxide emissions per unit of electricity generated. In 2010, coal contributed about 81% of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions from generation and contributed about 45% of the electricity generated in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url= http://www.epa.gov/climatechange/ghgemissions/sources/electricity.html
|title=Electricity Sector Emissions Climate Change
|work= US EPA
|year=2012
|accessdate=August 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2000, the carbon intensity (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions) of U.S. coal thermal combustion was 2249&amp;nbsp;lbs/MWh (1,029&amp;nbsp;kg/MWh)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/cleanrgy/energy-and-you/affect/coal.html ''US EPA Clean Energy—Coal'']&lt;/ref&gt; while the carbon intensity of U.S. oil thermal generation was 1672&amp;nbsp;lb/MWh (758&amp;nbsp;kg/MWh or 211&amp;nbsp;kg/[[gigajoule|GJ]])&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/cleanrgy/energy-and-you/affect/oil.html ''US EPA Clean Energy—Oil]&lt;/ref&gt; and the carbon intensity of U.S. natural gas thermal production was 1135&amp;nbsp;lb/MWh (515&amp;nbsp;kg/MWh or 143&amp;nbsp;kg/GJ).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/cleanrgy/energy-and-you/affect/natural-gas.html ''US EPA Clean Energy—Gas'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ([[IPCC]]) reports that increased quantities of the [[greenhouse gas]] carbon dioxide within the atmosphere will "very likely" lead to higher average temperatures on a global scale ([[global warming]]). Concerns regarding the potential for such warming to change the global climate prompted IPCC recommendations calling for large cuts to CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions worldwide.&lt;ref name="ipcc summary"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/wg1/ar4-wg1-spm.pdf|title=Summary for policymakers|last=Solomon, S.|year=2007|work=A report of Working Group I of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|publisher=IPCC|accessdate=24 March 2010|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Emissions can be reduced with higher combustion temperatures, yielding more efficient production of electricity within the cycle. [[Carbon capture and storage]] (CCS) of emissions from coal-fired power stations is another alternative but the technology is still being developed and will increase the cost of fossil fuel-based production of electricity. CCS may not be economically viable, unless the price of emitting CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to the atmosphere rises.

===Particulate matter===
Another problem related to coal combustion is the emission of [[Atmospheric particulate matter|particulates]] that have a serious impact on public health. Power plants remove particulate from the flue gas with the use of a [[Dust collector#Fabric filters|bag house]] or [[electrostatic precipitator]]. Several newer plants that burn coal use a different process, [[Combined cycle#Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC)|Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle]] in which [[synthesis gas]] is made out of a reaction between coal and water. The synthesis gas is processed to remove most pollutants and then used initially to power gas turbines. Then the hot exhaust gases from the gas turbines are used to generate steam to power a steam turbine. The pollution levels of such plants are drastically lower than those of "classic" coal power plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Particulate matter from coal-fired plants can be harmful and have negative health impacts. Studies have shown that exposure to particulate matter is related to an increase of respiratory and cardiac mortality.&lt;ref name="Nel, A. 2005"&gt;Nel, A. (2005, May 6). Air Pollution-Related Illness: Effects of Particles. Science, 308(5723), 804-806.&lt;/ref&gt; Particulate matter can irritate small airways in the lungs, which can lead to increased problems with asthma, chronic bronchitis, airway obstruction, and gas exchange.&lt;ref name="Nel, A. 2005"/&gt;

There are different types of particulate matter, depending on the chemical composition and size. The dominant form of particulate matter from coal-fired plants is [[Fly ash|coal fly ash]], but secondary sulfate and nitrate also comprise a major portion of the particulate matter from coal-fired plants.&lt;ref name="Grahame, T. 2007"&gt;Grahame, T., &amp; Schlesinger, R. (2007, April 15). Health Effects of Airborne Particulate Matter: Do We Know Enough to Consider Regulating Specific Particle Types or Sources?. Inhalation Toxicology, 19(6–7), 457–481.&lt;/ref&gt; Coal fly ash is what remains after the coal has been combusted, so it consists of the incombustible materials that are found in the coal.&lt;ref name="Schobert, H. H. 2002"&gt;Schobert, H. H. (2002). ''Energy and Society.'' New York: Taylor &amp; Francis, 241–255.&lt;/ref&gt;

The size and chemical composition of these particles affects the impacts on human health.&lt;ref name="Nel, A. 2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Grahame, T. 2007"/&gt; Currently coarse (diameter greater than 2.5 μm) and fine (diameter between 0.1 μm and 2.5 μm) particles are regulated, but ultrafine particles (diameter less than 0.1 μm) are currently unregulated, yet they pose many dangers.&lt;ref name="Nel, A. 2005"/&gt; Unfortunately much is still unknown as to which kinds of particulate matter pose the most harm, which makes it difficult to come up with adequate legislation for regulating particulate matter.&lt;ref name="Grahame, T. 2007"/&gt;

There are several methods of helping to reduce the particulate matter emissions from coal-fired plants. Roughly 80% of the ash falls into an ash hopper, but the rest of the ash then gets carried into the atmosphere to become coal-fly ash.&lt;ref name="Schobert, H. H. 2002"/&gt; Methods of reducing these emissions of particulate matter include:
# a [[Baghouse#Fabric filters|baghouse]]
# an [[electrostatic precipitator]] (ESP)
# [[Combined cycle#Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC)|cyclone collector]]
The baghouse has a fine filter that collects the ash particles, electrostatic precipitators use an electric field to trap ash particles on high-voltage plates, and cyclone collectors use centrifugal force to trap particles to the walls.&lt;ref name="Schobert, H. H. 2002"/&gt; A recent study indicates that sulfur emissions from fossil fueled power stations in China may have caused a 10-year lull in global warming (1998-2008).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/capital-weather-gang/post/new-study-blames-10-year-lull-in-global-warming-on-china-coal-use-air-pollution/2011/07/05/gHQAwjV8yH_blog.html|title=New study blames 10-year lull in global warming on China coal use, air pollution|last=Freedman|first=Andrew|date=July 5, 2011|website=Washington Post|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Radioactive trace elements===
Coal is a sedimentary rock formed primarily from accumulated plant matter, and it includes many inorganic minerals and elements which were deposited along with organic material during its formation. As the rest of the Earth's [[Crust (geology)|crust]], coal also contains low levels of [[uranium]], [[thorium]], and other naturally occurring [[radioactive isotopes]] whose release into the environment leads to [[radioactive contamination]]. While these substances are present as very small trace impurities, enough coal is burned that significant amounts of these substances are released. A 1,000 MW coal-burning power plant could have an uncontrolled release of as much as 5.2 metric tons per year of uranium (containing {{convert|74|lb|kg}} of [[uranium-235]]) and 12.8 metric tons per year of thorium.&lt;ref name="ORNL"&gt;[http://www.ornl.gov/info/ornlreview/rev26-34/text/colmain.html Coal Combustion: Nuclear Resource or Danger?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070205103749/http://www.ornl.gov/info/ornlreview/rev26-34/text/colmain.html |date=5 February 2007}} by Alex Gabbard, [[ORNL]] Review, Summer/Fall 1993, Vol. 26, Nos. 3 and 4.&lt;/ref&gt; In comparison, a 1,000 MW nuclear plant will generate about 30 metric tons of high-level radioactive solid packed waste per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Thompson|first1=Linda|title=Vitrification of Nuclear Waste|url=http://large.stanford.edu/courses/2010/ph240/thompson2/|website=PH240 - Fall 2010: Introduction to the Physics of Energy|publisher=Stanford University|accessdate=10 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that during 1982, US coal burning released 155 times as much uncontrolled radioactivity into the atmosphere as the [[Three Mile Island incident]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.physics.ohio-state.edu/~aubrecht/coalvsnucMarcon.pdf#page=8 Physics.ohio-state.edu] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327101806/http://www.physics.ohio-state.edu/~aubrecht/coalvsnucMarcon.pdf |date=27 March 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The collective radioactivity resulting from all coal burning worldwide between 1937 and 2040 is estimated to be 2,700,000 curies or 0.101 EBq.&lt;ref name="ORNL" /&gt; During normal operation, the effective dose equivalent from coal plants is 100 times that from nuclear plants.&lt;ref name="ORNL" /&gt; Normal operation however, is a deceiving baseline for comparison: just the [[Chernobyl disaster|Chernobyl nuclear disaster]] released, in iodine-131 alone, an estimated 1.76 EBq.&lt;ref name="newscientist1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn20285-fukushima-radioactive-fallout-nears-chernobyl-levels.html |title=Fukushima radioactive fallout nears Chernobyl levels |publisher=Newscientist.com |accessdate=24 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; of radioactivity, a value one order of magnitude above this value for total emissions from all coal burned within a century, while the iodine-131, the major radioactive substance which comes out in accident situations, has a half life of just 8 days.

===Water and air contamination by coal ash===
A study released in August 2010 that examined state pollution data in the United States by the organizations [[Environmental Integrity Project]], the [[Sierra Club]] and [[Earthjustice]] found that coal ash produced by coal-fired power plants dumped at sites across 21 U.S. states has contaminated ground water with toxic elements. The contaminants including the poisons [[arsenic]] and [[lead]].&lt;ref name="mcclatchydc.com"&gt;[http://www.mcclatchydc.com/2010/08/26/99728/study-of-coal-ash-sites-finds.html "Study of Coal Ash Sites Finds Extensive Water Contamination"] ''McClatchy''; also archived at: [http://www.commondreams.org/headline/2010/08/27-4 commondreams.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

Arsenic has been shown to cause [[skin cancer]], [[bladder cancer]] and [[lung cancer]], and lead damages the [[nervous system]].&lt;ref name=EJ2010&gt;EarthJustice news release, 2010 Sept. 16, [http://unearthed.earthjustice.org/blog/2010-september/new-report-coal-ash-linked-cancer-and-other-maladies "New Report—Coal Ash Linked To Cancer and Other Maladies; Coal's Waste Is Poisoning Communities in 34 States"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100919000203/http://unearthed.earthjustice.org/blog/2010-september/new-report-coal-ash-linked-cancer-and-other-maladies |date=19 September 2010 }} Earthjustice.org and [[Physicians for Social Responsibility]], [http://earthjustice.org/sites/default/files/files/CoalAsh_Earthjustice.pdf "Coal Ash: The Toxic Threat to Our Communities and Our Environment"] 2010 September 16, earthjustice.org&lt;/ref&gt; Coal ash contaminants are also linked to respiratory diseases and other health and developmental problems, and have disrupted local aquatic life.&lt;ref name="mcclatchydc.com"/&gt;  Coal ash also releases a variety of toxic contaminants into nearby air, posing a health threat to those who breath in fugitive coal dust.
&lt;ref name=EJ2010/&gt;

Currently, the EPA does not regulate the disposal of coal ash; regulation is up to the states and the electric power industry has been lobbying to maintain this status quo. Most states require no monitoring of drinking water near coal ash dump sites. The study found an additional 39 contaminated U.S. sites and concluded that the problem of coal ash-caused water contamination is even more extensive in the United States than has been estimated. The study brought to 137 the number of ground water sites across the United States that are contaminated by power plant-produced coal ash.&lt;ref name="mcclatchydc.com"/&gt;

====Mercury contamination====
{{Main|Mercury (element)}}

U.S. government scientists tested fish in 291 streams around the country for [[mercury contamination]]. They found mercury in every fish tested, according to the study by the [[U.S. Department of the Interior]]. They found mercury even in fish of isolated rural waterways. Twenty five percent of the fish tested had mercury levels above the safety levels determined by the [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] for people who eat the fish regularly. The largest source of mercury contamination in the United States is coal-fueled power plant emissions.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/20/science/earth/20brfs-MERCURYFOUND_BRF.html?_r=1&amp;em nytimes.com "Mercury Found in Every Fish Tested, Scientists Say"] ''New York Times'', 2009 Aug. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

==Greening of fossil fuel power plants==
{{Main|Coal pollution mitigation|Landfill#Reclaiming materials}}
{{Further|Zero Emission Fossil Fuel Power Plants}}
Several methods exist to improve the efficiency of fossil fuel power plants. A frequently used and cost-efficient method is to convert a plant to run on a different fuel. This includes conversions of coal power plants to biomass or waste&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archives-suez.com/document/?f=developpement-durable/en/awirs_en.pdf Coal to biomass power plant conversion]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.25x25.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=579&amp;Itemid=191 Coal to biomass conversion by Georgia Power]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ist-world.org/ProjectDetails.aspx?ProjectId=a6556d81d97d41d2be8e31759221b824 Conversion of coal to waste-fired power plant] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090721171617/http://www.ist-world.org/ProjectDetails.aspx?ProjectId=a6556d81d97d41d2be8e31759221b824 |date=21 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and conversions of natural gas power plants to biogas. Conversions of coal powered power plants to waste-fired power plants have an extra benefit in that they can reduce [[landfill]]ing. In addition, waste-fired power plants can be equipped with material recovery, which is also beneficial to the environment. In some instances, [[torrefaction]] of biomass may be needed if biomass is the material the converted fossil fuel power plant will be using.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ecn.nl/nl/nieuws/item/successful-test-with-innovative-renewable-energy-source-at-amer-power-plant/ Torrefaction of biomass sometimes needed when using biomass in converted FFPS]&lt;/ref&gt;

Improving energy efficiency of a coal-fired power plant also reduces emissions. For example, emissions can be reduced by upgrading existing plants or building new high-efficiency, low-emissions plants. Such plants emit almost 20% less CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; than a subcritical unit operating at a similar load. Over the longer term, HELE plants can further facilitate emission reductions because coal-fired plants operating at the highest efficiencies are also the most appropriate option for [[carbon capture and storage]] retrofit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Regardless of the conversion, a truly low-carbon fossil fuel power plant implements carbon capture and storage, which means that the exhaust CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is not released into the environment and the fossil fuel power plant becomes an [https://web.archive.org/web/20090705094616/http://www.zero-emissionplatform.eu/website/library/ emissionless power plant]. A 2006 example of a carbon capture and storage fossil fuel power plant is the pilot Elsam power station near Esbjerg, Denmark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Coal Pollution Mitigation===
[[Coal pollution mitigation|Coal Pollution Mitigation]] is a process whereby coal is chemically washed of [[mineral]]s and impurities, sometimes [[Gasification|gasified]], burned and the resulting flue gases treated with steam, with the purpose of removing sulfur dioxide, and reburned so as to make the carbon dioxide in the flue gas economically recoverable, and storable underground (the latter of which is called "carbon capture and storage"). The coal industry uses the term "clean coal" to describe technologies designed to enhance both the efficiency and the environmental acceptability of coal extraction, preparation and use,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.australiancoal.com.au/cleanoview.htm AustralianCoal.com.au] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071207111230/http://www.australiancoal.com.au/cleanoview.htm |date=7 December 2007 }}—Clean Coal Overview&lt;/ref&gt; but has provided no specific quantitative limits on any emissions, particularly carbon dioxide. Whereas contaminants like sulfur or mercury can be removed from coal, carbon cannot be effectively removed while still leaving a usable fuel, and clean coal plants without carbon sequestration and storage do not significantly reduce carbon dioxide emissions. [[James Hansen]] in an open letter to U.S. President [[Barack Obama]] has advocated a "moratorium and phase-out of coal plants that do not capture and store CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;". In his book ''[[Storms of My Grandchildren]]'', similarly, Hansen discusses his ''Declaration of Stewardship'' the first principle of which requires "a moratorium on coal-fired power plants that do not capture and sequester carbon dioxide".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Hansen, James |title=Storms of My Grandchildren |publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing |location=London |year=2009 |isbn=1-4088-0745-9 |page=242 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Clean gas===
Gas-fired power plants can also be modified to run on [[hydrogen]], the latter of which can be created on-site from natural gas.&lt;ref&gt;[https://energy.gov/eere/fuelcells/hydrogen-production-natural-gas-reforming Natural gas to hydrogen: Natural gas reforming]&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2013, the conversion process has been improved by scientists at Karlsruhe Liquid-metal Laboratory (KALLA) as they succeeded in allowing the soot to be easily removed (soot is a byproduct of the process and damaged the working parts in the past -most notably the nickel-iron-cobaltcatalyst-).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg23230940-200-crack-methane-for-fossil-fuels-without-tears/ The reaction that would give us clean fossil fuels forever]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://phys.org/news/2013-04-hydrogen-methane-co2-emissions.html Hydrogen from methane without CO2 emissions]&lt;/ref&gt; The soot (which contains the carbon) can then be stored underground and is not released into the atmosphere.

==Alternatives to fossil fuel power plants==
[[File:U.S. 2014 Electricity Generation By Type.png|thumb|U.S. 2014 Electricity Generation By Type.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eia.gov/electricity/monthly/epm_table_grapher.cfm?t=epmt_1_01 EIA - Electricity Data&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Alternatives to fossil fuel power plants include [[nuclear power]], [[solar power]], [[geothermal power]], [[wind power]], [[hydropower]], [[Biomass|biomass power plants]] and other [[renewable energy|renewable energies]] (see [[non-carbon economy]]). Some of these are proven technologies on an industrial scale (i.e. nuclear, wind, tidal, hydroelectric and biomass fired power) others are still in prototype form.

Nuclear power, and geothermal power may be classed as heat pollutants as they add heat energy to the biosphere that would not otherwise be released.{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}} The net quantity of energy conversion within the biosphere due to the utilisation of wind power, solar power, tidal power, hydroelectric power (hydroelectricity) is static and is derived from the effects of sunlight and the movement of the moon and planets.

Generally, the cost of electrical energy produced by non fossil fuel burning power plants is greater than that produced by burning fossil fuels. This statement however only includes the cost to produce the electrical energy and does not take into account indirect costs associated with the many pollutants created by burning fossil fuels (e.g. increased hospital admissions due to respiratory diseases caused by fine smoke particles).

===Relative cost by generation source===
{{See also|Relative cost of electricity generated by different sources}}

When comparing power plant costs, it is customary to start by calculating the cost of power at the generator terminals by considering several main factors. External costs such as connections costs, the effect of each plant on the distribution grid are considered separately as an additional cost to the calculated power cost at the terminals.

Initial factors considered are:
* Capital costs, including waste disposal and decommissioning costs for nuclear energy.
* Operating and maintenance costs.
* Fuel costs for fossil fuel and biomass sources, and which may be negative for wastes.
* Likely annual hours per year run or load factor, which may be as low as 30% for wind energy, or as high as 90% for nuclear energy.
* Offset sales of heat, for example in combined heat and power district heating (CHP/DH).

These costs occur over the 30–50 year life of the fossil fuel power plants, using [[discounted cash flow]]s. In general large fossil plants are attractive due to their low initial capital costs—typically around £750–£1000 per kilowatt electrical compared to perhaps £1500 per kilowatt for onshore wind.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

'''High-temperature operating life (HTOL)''' is a reliability test applied to [[integrated circuits]] (ICs) to determine their [[Intrinsic and extrinsic properties |intrinsic]] reliability. This test stresses the IC at an elevated [[Thermodynamic temperature|temperature]], high voltage and dynamic operation for a predefined period of time. The IC is usually monitored under stress and tested at intermediate intervals. This reliability stress test is sometimes referred to as a "lifetime test", "device life test" or "extended [[burn in]] test" and is used to trigger potential failure modes and assess IC [[service life |lifetime]].

There are several types of HTOL:

==Design considerations==
The main aim of the HTOL is to age the device such that a short experiment will allow the lifetime of the IC to be predicted (e.g. 1,000 HTOL hours shall predict a minimum of "X" years of operation). Good HTOL process shall avoid relaxed HTOL operation and also prevents overstressing the IC. This method ages all IC's building blocks to allow relevant failure modes to be triggered and implemented in a short reliability experiment. A precise multiplier, known as the Acceleration Factor (AF) simulates long lifetime operation.

The AF represents the accelerated aging factor relative to the useful life application conditions.

For effective HTOL stress testing, several variables should be considered:
#Digital toggling factor
#Analog modules operation
#I/O ring activity
#Monitor design
#Ambient temperature (Ta)
#Junction temperature (Tj)
#Voltage stress (Vstrs)
#Acceleration factor (AF)
#Test duration (t)
#Sample size (SS)

A detailed description of the above variables, using a hypothetical, simplified IC with several RAMs, digital logic, an analog voltage regulator module and I/O ring, together with the HTOL design considerations for each are provided below.

===Digital toggling factor===
The digital toggling factor (DTF) represents the number of transistors that change their state during the stress test, relative to the total number of gates in the digital portion of the IC. In effect, the DTF is the percentage of transistors toggling in one time unit. The time unit is relative to the toggling frequency, and is usually limited by the HTOL setup to be in the range of 10–20Mhz.

Reliability engineers strive to toggle as many as possible transistors for each time unit of measure. The RAMs (and other memory types) are usually activated using the [[Built-in self-test|BIST]] function, while the logic is usually activated with the [[Scan chain|SCAN]] function, [[Linear feedback shift register|LFSR]] or [[Logic built-in self-test|logic BIST]].

The power and the self-heating of the digital portion of the IC are evaluated and the device's aging estimated. These two measures are aligned so that they are similar to the aging of other elements of the IC. The degrees of freedom for aligning these measures are the voltage stress and/or the time period during which the HTOL program loops these blocks relative to other IC blocks.

===Analog modules operation===
The recent trend of integrating as many electronic components as possible into a single chip is known as system on a chip (SoC).

This trend complicates reliability engineers' work because (usually) the analog portion of the chip dissipates higher power relative to the other IC elements.

This higher power may generate hot spots and areas of accelerated aging. Reliability engineers must understand the power distribution on the chip and align the aging so that it is similar for all elements of an IC.

In our hypothetical [[System on a chip|SoC]] the analog module only includes a voltage regulator. In reality, there may be additional analog modules e.g. [[Power management|PMIC]], oscillators, or [[charge pump]]s. To perform efficient stress tests on the analog elements, reliability engineers must identify the worst-case scenario for the relevant analog blocks in the IC. For example, the worst-case scenario for [[voltage regulator]]s may be the maximum regulation voltage and maximum load current; for charge pumps it may be the minimum supply voltage and maximum load current.

Good engineering practice calls for the use of external loads (external R,L,C) to force the necessary currents. This practice avoids loading differences due to the chip's different operational schemes and operation [[Trimmer (electronics)|trimming]] of its analog parts.

Statistical methods are used to check [[Engineering tolerance|statistical tolerances]], variation and temperature stability of the loads used, and to define the right confidence bands for the loads to avoid over/under stress at HTOL operating range. The degrees of freedom for aligning the aging magnitude of analog parts is usually the [[Duty cycle|duty-cycle]], external load values and voltage stress.

===I/O ring activity===
The interface between the "outside world" and the IC is made via the input/output (I/O) ring. This ring contains power I/O ports, digital I/O ports and analog I/O ports. The I/Os are (usually) wired via the IC package to the "outside world" and each I/O executes its own specific command instructions, e.g. [[Joint Test Action Group|JTAG]] ports, [[IC power supply pin|IC power supply ports]] etc. Reliability engineering aims to age all I/Os in the same way as the other IC elements. This can be achieved by using a [[Boundary scan]] operation.

===Monitor design===
As previously mentioned, the main aim of the HTOL is aging the samples by dynamic stress at elevated voltage and/or temperature. During the HTOL operation, we need to assure that the IC is active, toggling and constantly functioning.

At the same time, we need to know at what point the IC stops responding, these data are important for calculating price reliability indices and for facilitating the [[Failure analysis|FA]]. This is done by monitoring the device via one or more vital IC parameters signals communicated and logged by the HTOL machine and providing continuous indication about the IC's functionality throughout the HTOL run time. Examples of commonly used monitors include the BIST "done" flag signal, the SCAN output chain or the analog module output.

There are three types of monitoring: 
# Pattern matching: The actual output signal is compared to the expected one and alerts about any deviation. The main disadvantage of this monitor type is its sensitivity to any minor deviation from the expected signal. During the HTOL, the IC runs at a temperature and/or voltages that occasionally fall outside its specification, which may cause artificial sensitivity and/or a malfunction that fails the matching but is not a real failure.  
# Activity: Counts the number of toggles and if the results are higher than a predefined threshold the monitor indicates OK. The main disadvantage of this type of monitoring is the chance that unexpected noise or signal could be wrongly interpreted. This issue arises mainly in the case of low count toggling monitor.  
# Activity within a predefine range: Checks that the monitor responds within a predefined limit, for example when then number of toggles is within a predefined limit or the output of the voltage regulator is within a predefined range.

===Ambient temperature (Ta)===
According to JEDEC standards, the environmental chamber should be capable of maintaining the specified temperature within a tolerance of ±5&amp;nbsp;°C throughout while parts are loaded and unpowered. Today's environmental chambers have better capabilities and can exhibit temperature stability within a range of ±3&amp;nbsp;°C throughout. 

===Junction temperature (Tj)===
Low power ICs can be stressed without major attention to self-heating affects. However, due to technology scaling and manufacturing variations, power dissipation within a single production lot of devices can vary by as much as 40%. This variation, in addition to high power IC makes advanced contact temperature controls necessary for facilitating individual control systems for each IC

===Voltage stress (Vstrs)===
The operating voltage should be at least the maximum specified for the device. In some cases a higher voltage is applied to obtain lifetime acceleration from voltage as well as temperature. 

To define the maximum permitted voltage stress, the following methods can be considered:
# Force 80% of breakdown voltage; 
# Force six-sigma less than the breakdown voltage;
# Set the overvoltage to be higher than the maximum specified voltage. An overvoltage level of 140% of the maximum voltage is occasionally used for MIL and automotive applications.  

Reliability engineers must check that V&lt;sub&gt;stress&lt;/sub&gt; does not exceed the maximum rated voltage for the relevant technology, as specified by the FAB.

===Acceleration factor (AF)===
The Acceleration factor (AF) is a multiplier that relates a product’s life at an accelerated stress level to the life at the use stress level. 

An AF of 20 means 1 hour at stress condition is equivalent to 20 hours at useful condition. 

The voltage acceleration factor is represented by AFv. Usually the stress voltage is equal to or higher than the maximum voltage. An elevated voltage provides additional acceleration and can be used to increase effective device hours or achieve an equivalent life point.

There are several AFv models: 
#E model or the constant field/voltage acceleration exponential model;
#1/E model or, equivalently, the anode hole injection model;
#V model, where the failure rate is exponential to voltage
#Anode hydrogen release for the power-law model

AFtemp is the acceleration factor due to changes in temperature and is usually based on the [[Arrhenius equation]]. The total acceleration factor is the product of AFv and AFtemp

===Test duration (t)===
The reliability test duration assures the device’s adequate lifetime requirement. 

For example, with an activation energy of 0.7&amp;nbsp;eV, 125 °C stress temperature and 55 °C use temperature, the acceleration factor (Arrhenius equation) is 78.6. This means that 1,000 hours' stress duration is equivalent to 9 years of use. The reliability engineer decides on the qualification test duration. Industry good practice calls for 1,000 hours at a junction temperature of 125&amp;nbsp;°C.

===Sample size (SS)===
The challenge for new reliability assessment and qualification systems is determining the relevant failure mechanisms to optimize sample size. 

Sample plans are statistically derived from manufacturer risk, consumer risk, and the expected failure rate. The commonly used sampling plan of zero rejects out of 230 samples is equal to three rejects out of 668 samples assuming LTPD =1 and a 90% confidence interval.

==HTOL policy==
===Sample selection===
Samples shall include representative samples from at least three nonconsecutive lots to represent manufacturing variability. All test samples shall be fabricated, handled, screened and assembled in the same way as during the production phase.

===Sample preparation===
Samples shall be tested prior to stress and at predefined checkpoints. It is good engineering practice to test samples at maximum and minimum rating temperatures as well as at room temperature. Data logs of all functional and parametric tests shall be collated for further analysis. 

===Test duration===
Assuming Tj = 125 °C, commonly used checkpoints are after 48, 168, 500 and 1,000 hours. 

Different checkpoints for different temperatures can be calculated by using the Arrhenius equation. For example, with an activation energy of 0.7e V,  T&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; of 135°C and T&lt;sub&gt;use&lt;/sub&gt; of 55&amp;nbsp;°C the equivalent checkpoints will be at 29, 102, 303 and 606 hours. 

Electrical testing should be completed as soon as possible after the samples are removed. If the samples cannot be tested soon after their removal, additional stress time should be applied. The JEDEC standard requires samples be tested within 168 hours of removal. 

If testing exceeds the recommended time window, additional stress should be applied according to the table below:&lt;ref name="JEDEC Standard" /&gt;

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Time above recommended time window !! 0h &lt; h ≤ 168h !! 168h &lt; h ≤ 336h !! 336h &lt; h ≤ 504h !!  Other
|-
| Additional stress hours  || 24h ||  48h || 72h || 24 hours for each 168 hours
|}

===Merit numbers===
The merit number is the outcome of [[Sampling (statistics)|statistical sampling plans]].

Sampling plans are inputted to SENTENCE, an audit tool, to ensure that the output of a process meets the requirements. SENTENCE simply accepts or rejects the tested lots. The reliability engineer implements statistical sampling plans based on predefined Acceptance Quality Limits, LTPD, manufacturer risk and customer risk. For example, the commonly used sampling plan of 0 rejects out of 230 samples is equal to 3 rejects out of 668 samples assuming LTPD=1.

==HTOL in various industries==
The aging process of an IC is relative to its standard use conditions. The tables below provide reference to various commonly used products and the conditions under which they are used.

Reliability engineers are tasked with verifying the adequate stress duration. For example, for an activation energy of 0.7eV, a stress temperature of 125&amp;nbsp;°C and a use temperature of 55&amp;nbsp;°C, an expected operational life of five years is represented by a 557-hour HTOL experiment.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1681">An '''ice pond''' is a large volume of [[ice]] or [[snow]] produced by natural [[winter]] freezing. The ice is then used for cooling or [[air conditioning]].

Before refrigeration was common, ice ponds were [[Ice cutting|mined]] by ice companies, with product transported to consumers and food businesses through much of the year. Refrigeration technology replaced this technology.

In more recent times, ice ponds have been revived as an environmentally friendly way to air condition buildings in the [[summer]].  The best known experiment is the 'Princeton ice pond' by [[Ted Taylor (physicist)|Ted Taylor]] in 1981.  He then persuaded the [[Prudential Financial|Prudential Insurance Company]] to use a bigger pond to provide air conditioning for a larger building.&lt;ref&gt;[[Freeman Dyson]], ''Imagined Worlds'', [[Harvard University Press]], 1998, {{ISBN|978-0-674-53909-9}}, page 41 [https://books.google.com/books?id=MOC8UJPuvO8C&amp;pg=PA42 (sur GoogleBooks]).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carter B.

'''Nanotechnology''' is impacting the field of [[consumer goods]], several products that incorporate [[nanomaterials]] are already in a variety of items; many of which people do not even realize contain [[nanoparticle]]s, products with novel functions ranging from [[easy-to-clean]] to [[Anti-scratch coating|scratch-resistant]]. Examples of that car bumpers are made lighter, clothing is more [[stain repellant]], sunscreen is more radiation resistant, synthetic bones are stronger, cell phone screens are lighter weight, glass packaging for drinks leads to a longer shelf-life, and balls for various sports are made more durable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Current Uses|url=http://www.nanotech-now.com/current-uses.htm|publisher=Nanotechnology Now}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using nanotech, in the mid-term  modern textiles will become "smart", through embedded "wearable electronics", such novel products have also a promising potential especially in the field of cosmetics, and has numerous potential applications in heavy industry. Nanotechnology is predicted to be a main driver of technology and business in this century and holds the promise of higher performance materials, intelligent systems and new production methods with significant impact for all aspects of society.

== Foods ==
A complex set of engineering and scientific challenges in the [[food industry|food]] and [[bioprocessing]] industry for manufacturing high quality and [[food safety|safe food]] through efficient and sustainable means can be solved through nanotechnology. Bacteria identification and [[food quality]] monitoring using [[biosensor]]s; intelligent, active, and smart food packaging systems; nanoencapsulation of [[bioactive compound|bioactive]] food compounds are few examples of emerging applications of nanotechnology for the food industry.&lt;ref&gt;Suresh Neethirajan, Digvir Jayas. 2009. Nanotechnology for food and bioprocessing industries. 5th CIGR International Technical Symposium on Food Processing, Monitoring Technology in Bioprocesses and Food Quality Management, Potsdam, Germany. 8 p.&lt;/ref&gt; Nanotechnology can be applied in the production, processing, safety and packaging of food. A nanocomposite coating process could improve food packaging by placing anti-microbial agents directly on the surface of the coated film.
[[Nanocomposite]]s could increase or decrease gas permeability of different fillers as is needed for different products. They can also improve the mechanical and heat-resistance properties and lower the oxygen transmission rate. Research is being performed to apply nanotechnology to the detection of chemical and biological substances for sensanges in foods.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

In general, food substances are not allowed to be adulterated, according to the [[Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act]] (section 402).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fda.gov/RegulatoryInformation/Legislation/FederalFoodDrugandCosmeticActFDCAct/FDCActChapterIVFood/ucm107527.htm Federal Food, Drug an Cosmetic Act] Retrieved 08/22/2012&lt;/ref&gt; Additives to food must conform to all regulations in the food additives amendment of 1958 as well as the [[Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997|FDA Modernization Act of 1997]]. In addition, color additives are obliged to comply with all regulations stipulated by the Color Additive Amendments of 1960. A safety assessment must be performed on all food substances for submission and approval by the US FDA. The mandatory information in this assessment includes the identity, technical effects, self-limiting levels of use, dietary exposure and safety studies for the manufacturing processes used, including the use of nanotechnology. Food manufacturers are obliged to assess whether the identity, safety or regulatory status of a food substance is affected by significant changes in manufacturing processes, such as the use of nanotechnology. In their guidance document published in April 2012, the US FDA discusses what considerations and recommendations may apply to such an assessment.{{cn|date=August 2015}}

===Nano-foods===
[[designer food|New foods]] are among the nanotechnology-created consumer products coming onto the market at the rate of 3 to 4 per week, according to the [[Project on Emerging Nanotechnologies]] (PEN), based on an inventory it has drawn up of 609 known or claimed nano-products. On PEN's list are three foods—a brand of [[canola]] cooking oil called Canola Active Oil, a tea called Nanotea and a chocolate diet shake called Nanoceuticals Slim Shake Chocolate. According to company information posted on PEN's Web site, the canola oil, by Shemen Industries of Israel, contains an additive called "nanodrops" designed to carry vitamins, minerals and phytochemicals through the digestive system and urea.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nanotechproject.org/inventories/consumer/browse/products/canola_active_oil/ Canola Active Oil]&lt;/ref&gt; The shake, according to U.S. manufacturer RBC Life Sciences Inc., uses cocoa infused "NanoClusters" to enhance the taste and [[health claim|health benefits]] of cocoa without the need for [[extra sugar]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?c=Article_C&amp;pagename=Zone-English-HealthScience%2FHSELayout&amp;cid=1216208224637 Nano-foods: The Next Consumer Scare?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110217100445/http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?c=Article_C&amp;cid=1216208224637&amp;pagename=Zone-English-HealthScience%2FHSELayout |date=2011-02-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consumer goods==

=== Surfaces and coatings ===
The most prominent application of nanotechnology in the household is self-cleaning or "[[easy-to-clean]]" surfaces on ceramics or glasses. [[Nanoceramic]] particles have improved the smoothness and heat resistance of common household equipment such as the [[Hair iron|flat iron]].{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

The first sunglasses using protective and anti-reflective ultrathin polymer coatings are on the market. For optics, nanotechnology also offers scratch resistant surface coatings based on nanocomposites. [[Nanophotonics|Nano-optics]] could allow for an increase in precision of pupil repair and other types of laser eye surgery.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

=== Textiles ===
The use of engineered nanofibers already makes clothes water- and stain-repellent or wrinkle-free. Textiles with a nanotechnological [[textile finishing|finish]] can be washed less frequently and at lower temperatures. Nanotechnology has been used to integrate tiny carbon particles membrane and guarantee full-surface protection from electrostatic charges for the wearer. Many other applications have been developed by research institutions such as the [http://nanotextiles.human.cornell.edu/ Textiles Nanotechnology Laboratory] at [[Cornell University]], and the UK's [[Defence Science and Technology Laboratory|Dstl]] and its spin out company [[P2i]].{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

=== Cosmetics ===
One field of application is in [[sunscreen]]s. The traditional chemical UV protection approach suffers from its poor long-term stability. A sunscreen based on mineral nanoparticles such as [[titanium oxide]] offer several advantages. Titanium oxide nanoparticles have a comparable UV protection property as the bulk material, but lose the cosmetically undesirable whitening as the particle size is decreased.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

=== Sports ===
Nanotechnology may also play a role in sports such as [[Association football|soccer]], [[American football|football]],&lt;ref name="mrsa"/&gt; and [[baseball]].&lt;ref name="eastonnanobat"/&gt; Materials for new athletic shoes may be made in order to make the shoe lighter (and the athlete faster).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.allbusiness.com/company-activities-management/product-management-product/7794245-1.html08| title = Nanocomposite Cushions Make Lighter Athletic Shoes | publisher = AllBusiness | date = | accessdate = 2009-11-02}} {{Dead link|date=July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baseball bats already on the market are made with carbon nanotubes that reinforce the resin, which is said to improve its performance by making it lighter.&lt;ref name="eastonnanobat"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://nanopedia.case.edu/NWPrint.php?page=nw.emw15.008| title = Easton Integrates Nanotechnology into Baseball Bats| publisher = Nanopedia| date = 2006-06-05| accessdate = 2009-11-06| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100613184558/http://nanopedia.case.edu/NWPrint.php?page=nw.emw15.008| archivedate = 2010-06-13| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other items such as sport towels, yoga mats, exercise mats are on the market and used by players in the [[National Football League]], which use antimicrobial nanotechnology to prevent parasuram from illnesses caused by bacteria such as [[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus]] (commonly known as MRSA).&lt;ref name="mrsa"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.azonano.com/news.asp?newsID=4363| title = Antimicrobial Nanotechnology Used by NFL Teams and Promoted to Professional Football Athletic Trainers | publisher = Azonano | date = 2007-06-27| accessdate = 2009-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aerospace and vehicle manufacturers==
Lighter and stronger materials will be of immense use to aircraft manufacturers, leading to increased performance. Spacecraft will also benefit, where weight is a major factor. Nanotechnology might thus help to reduce the size of equipment and thereby decrease fuel-consumption required to get it airborne. [[Hang glider]]s may be able to halve their weight while increasing their strength and toughness through the use of nanotech materials. Nanotech is lowering the mass of [[supercapacitor]]s that will increasingly be used to give power to assistive electrical motors for launching hang gliders off flatland to thermal-chasing altitudes.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

Much like aerospace, lighter and stronger materials would be useful for creating vehicles that are both faster and safer. Combustion engines might also benefit from parts that are more hard-wearing and more heat-resistant.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

== Military ==

===Biological sensors===
Nanotechnology can improve the military’s ability to detect biological agents. By using nanotechnology, the military would be able to create sensor systems that could detect biological agents.&lt;ref name=Calvin&gt;{{cite web|last=Shipbaugh|first=Calvin|title=Offense-Defense Aspects of Nanotechnologies: A Forecast of Potential Milita...|url=http://web.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=454bbd9b-ed72-4921-a823-4604a9f224b4%40sessionmgr114&amp;vid=6&amp;hid=122}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sensor systems are already well developed and will be one of the first forms of nanotechnology that the military will start to use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Soutter|first=Will|title=Nanotechnology in the Military|url=http://www.azonano.com/article.aspx?ArticleID=3028}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Uniform material===
Nanoparticles can be injected into the material on soldiers’ uniforms to not only make the material more durable, but also to protect soldiers from many different dangers such as high temperatures, impacts and chemicals.&lt;ref name=Calvin/&gt; The nanoparticles in the material protect soldiers from these dangers by grouping together when something strikes the armor and stiffening the area of impact. This stiffness helps lessen the impact of whatever hit the armor, whether it was extreme heat or a blunt force. By reducing the force of the impact, the nanoparticles protect the soldier wearing the uniform from any injury the impact could have caused.

Another way nanotechnology can improve soldiers’ uniforms is by creating a better form of camouflage. Mobile pigment nanoparticles injected into the material can produce a better form of camouflage.&lt;ref name="Jürgen"&gt;{{cite web|last=Altmann|first=Jürgen|title=Military Uses of Nanotechnology: Perspectives and Concerns|url=http://sdi.sagepub.com/content/35/1/61}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These mobile pigment particles would be able to change the color of the uniforms depending upon the area that the soldiers are in. There is still much research being done on this self-changing camouflage.

Nanotechnology can improve [[thermal camouflage]]. Thermal camouflage helps protect soldiers from people who are using night vision technology. Surfaces of many different military items can be designed in a way that electromagnetic radiation can help lower the infrared signatures of the object that the surface is on.&lt;ref name="Jürgen"/&gt; Surfaces of soldiers’ uniforms and surfaces of military vehicle are a few surfaces that can be designed in this way. By lowering the [[infrared signature]] of both the soldiers and the military vehicles the soldiers are using, it will provide better protection from infrared guided weapons or infrared surveillance sensors.

===Communication method===
There is a way to use nanoparticles to create coated polymer threads that can be woven into soldiers’ uniforms.&lt;ref name=Defence&gt;{{cite web|title=Defence, Weapons and The Use Of Nanotechnology In Modern Combat Equipment and Warfare Systems|url=http://www.azonano.com/article.aspx?ArticleID=1818}}&lt;/ref&gt; These polymer threads could be used as a form of communication between the soldiers.  The system of threads in the uniforms could be set to different light wavelengths, eliminating the ability for anyone else to listen in.&lt;ref name=Defence/&gt; This would lower the risk of having anything intercepted by unwanted listeners.

===Medical system===
A medical surveillance system for soldiers to wear can be made using nanotechnology. This system would be able to watch over their health and stress levels. The systems would be able to react to medical situations by releasing drugs or compressing wounds as necessary.&lt;ref name="Jürgen"/&gt; This means that if the system detected an injury that was bleeding, it would be able to compress around the wound until further medical treatment could be received. The system would also be able to release drugs into the soldier’s body for health reasons, such as pain killers for an injury. The system would be able to inform the medics at base of the soldier’s health status at all times that the soldier is wearing the system. The energy needed to communicate this information back to base would be produced through the soldier’s body movements.&lt;ref name="Jürgen"/&gt;

===Weapons===
Nanoweapon is the name given to military [[technology]] currently under development which seeks to exploit the power of nanotechnology in the modern [[battle]]field.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldtribune.com/worldtribune/WTARC/2009/lev0244_03_20.asp In the new nanoweapons era, the United States and Britain are Third World countries]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.newsmax.com/archives/articles/2003/9/25/210250.shtml An Interview on Nanoweapons] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120829032252/http://archive.newsmax.com/archives/articles/2003/9/25/210250.shtml |date=2012-08-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.technologyreview.com/read_article.aspx?id=13558&amp;ch=biotech Nano Weapons Join the Fight Against Cancer]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philosophers.co.uk/cafe/provocations5.htm Number Five: The Case for Nanoweapons] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927050343/http://www.philosophers.co.uk/cafe/provocations5.htm |date=September 27, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Risks in military===
* People such as state agencies, criminals and enterprises could use nano-robots to [[Eavesdropping|eavesdrop]] on conversations held in private.&lt;ref name="Jürgen"/&gt;
* [[Grey goo]]: an uncontrollable, self-replicating nano-machine or robot.
* Nanoparticles used in different military materials could potentially be a hazard to the soldiers that are wearing the material, if the material is allowed to get worn out. As the uniforms wear down it is possible for nanomaterial to break off and enter the soldiers’ bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Glenn|first=Jerome|title=Nanotechnology: Future military environmental health considerations|journal=Technological Forecasting and Social Change|date=February 2006|volume=73|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0040162505000909|doi=10.1016/j.techfore.2005.06.010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having nanoparticles entering the soldiers’ bodies would be very unhealthy and could seriously harm them. There is not a lot of information on what the actual damage to the soldiers would be, but there have been studies on the effect of nanoparticles entering a fish through its skin. The studies showed that the different fish in the study suffered from varying degrees of brain damage. Although brain damage would be a serious negative effect, the studies also say that the results cannot be taken as an accurate example of what would happen to soldiers if nanoparticles entered their bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bird|first=Peter|title=Entering the body - Societal Dynamics of Nanotechnology|url=http://web2.clarkson.edu/projects/nanobird/2.3.php|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140930171053/http://web2.clarkson.edu/projects/nanobird/2.3.php|archivedate=2014-09-30|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are very strict regulations on the scientists that manufacture products with nanoparticles. With these strict regulations, they are able to largely decrease the danger of nanoparticles wearing off of materials and entering the soldiers’ systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Guidelines for Safe Handling, Use and Disposal of Nanoparticles|url=http://iopscience.iop.org/1742-6596/170/1/012037/pdf/jpconf9_170_012037.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Catalysis ==

Chemical [[catalysis]] benefits especially from nanoparticles, due to the extremely large [[surface-to-volume ratio]]. The application potential of nanoparticles in catalysis ranges from [[fuel cell]] to [[catalytic converter]]s and [[photocatalytic]] devices. Catalysis is also important for the production of chemicals. For example, nanoparticles with a distinct chemical surrounding ([[ligand]]s), or specific [[optical properties]].{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

[[Platinum nanoparticle]]s are being considered in the next generation of automotive catalytic converters because the very high surface area of nanoparticles could reduce the amount of platinum required.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanelements.com/news_10_03_07.htm Press Release: American Elements Announces P-Mite Line of Platinum Nanoparticles for Catalyst Applications] [[American Elements]], October 3, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; However, some concerns have been raised due to experiments demonstrating that they will [[spontaneous combustion|spontaneously combust]] if [[methane]] is mixed with the ambient air.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nanotechweb.org/cws/article/tech/22075 Platinum nanoparticles bring spontaneous ignition], April 25, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Ongoing research at the [[Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique]] (CNRS) in France may resolve their true usefulness for catalytic applications.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=16694399 Electrocatalytic oxidation of methanol]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nanofiltration]] may come to be an important application, although future research must be careful to investigate possible toxicity.&lt;ref name="Nature"&gt;Hillie, Thembela and Mbhuti Hlophe. "Nanotechnology and the challenge of clean water." Nature.com/naturenanotechonolgy. November 2007: Volume 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Construction ==
Nanotechnology has the potential to make [[construction]] faster, cheaper, safer, and more varied. Automation of nanotechnology construction can allow for the creation of structures from advanced homes to massive skyscrapers much more quickly and at much lower cost. In the near future,
Nanotechnology can be used to sense cracks in foundations of architecture and can send nanobots to repair them.&lt;ref name="Construction"&gt;{{cite web|last=Mann|first=Surinder|title=Nanotechnology and Construction|url=http://www.nanowerk.com/nanotechnology/reports/reportpdf/report62.pdf|publisher=Nanoforum.org European Nanotechnology Gateway|accessdate=2 January 2012|date=31 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Institute of Nanotechnology"&gt;{{cite web|last=Feuer|first=Carl|title=Nanotechnology and Construction|url=http://www.elcosh.org/document/1937/d001104/Nanotechnology%2Band%2BConstruction.html?show_text=1#6|accessdate=23 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nanotechnology is an active research area that encompasses a number of disciplines such as electronics, bio-mechanics and coatings. These disciplines assist in the areas of civil engineering and construction materials.&lt;ref name="Construction"/&gt; If nanotechnology is implemented in the construction of homes and infrastructure, such structures will be stronger. If buildings are stronger, then fewer of them will require reconstruction and less waste will be produced.

Nanotechnology in construction involves using nanoparticles such as alumina and silica. Manufacturers are also investigating the methods of producing nano-cement. If cement with nano-size particles can be manufactured and processed, it will open up a large number of opportunities in the fields of ceramics, high strength composites and electronic applications. 
&lt;ref name="Construction"/&gt;

Nanomaterials still have a high cost relative to conventional materials, meaning that they are not likely to feature in high-volume building materials. The day when this technology slashes the consumption of structural steel has not yet been contemplated.&lt;ref name=NBS&gt;{{cite web|title=Nanotechnology in Construction|url=http://www.thenbs.com/topics/ConstructionProducts/articles/nanotechnologyInConstruction.asp|accessdate=23 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cement===
Much analysis of concrete is being done at the nano-level in order to understand its structure. Such analysis uses various techniques developed for study at that scale such as Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Focused Ion Beam (FIB). This has come about as a side benefit of the development of these instruments to study the nanoscale in general, but the understanding of the structure and behavior of concrete at the fundamental level is an important and very appropriate use of nanotechnology. One of the fundamental aspects of nanotechnology is its interdisciplinary nature and there has already been cross over research between the mechanical modeling of bones for medical engineering to that of concrete which has enabled the study of chloride diffusion in concrete (which causes corrosion of reinforcement). Concrete is, after all, a macro-material strongly influenced by its nano-properties and understanding it at this new level is yielding new avenues for improvement of strength, durability and monitoring as outlined in the following paragraphs

Silica (SiO2) is present in conventional concrete as part of the normal mix. However, one of the advancements made by the study of concrete at the nanoscale is that particle packing in concrete can be improved by using nano-silica which leads to a densifying of the micro and nanostructure resulting in improved mechanical properties. Nano-silica addition to cement based materials can also control the degradation of the fundamental C-S-H (calcium-silicatehydrate) reaction of concrete caused by calcium leaching in water as well as block water penetration and therefore lead to improvements in durability. Related to improved particle packing, high energy milling of ordinary Portland cement (OPC) clinker and standard sand, produces a greater particle size diminution with respect to conventional OPC and, as a result, the compressive strength of the refined material is also 3 to 6 times higher (at different ages).&lt;ref name="Institute of Nanotechnology"/&gt;

===Steel===

Steel is a widely available material that has a major role in the construction industry. The use of nanotechnology in steel helps to improve the physical properties of steel. Fatigue, or the structural failure of steel, is due to cyclic loading. Current steel designs are based on the reduction in the allowable stress, service life or regular inspection regime. This has a significant impact on the life-cycle costs of structures and limits the effective use of resources. Stress risers are responsible for initiating cracks from which fatigue failure results. The addition of [[copper nanoparticle]]s reduces the surface un-evenness of steel, which then limits the number of stress risers and hence fatigue cracking. Advancements in this technology through the use of nanoparticles would lead to increased safety, less need for regular inspection, and more efficient materials free from fatigue issues for construction.&lt;ref name="Construction"/&gt;

Steel cables can be strengthened using carbon nanotubes. Stronger cables reduce the costs and period of construction, especially in suspension bridges, as the cables are run from end to end of the span.&lt;ref name="Construction"/&gt;

The use of vanadium and molybdenum nanoparticles improves the delayed fracture problems associated with high strength bolts. This reduces the effects of hydrogen embrittlement and improves steel micro-structure by reducing the effects of the inter-granular cementite phase.&lt;ref name="Construction"/&gt;

Welds and the Heat Affected Zone (HAZ) adjacent to welds can be brittle and fail without warning when subjected to sudden dynamic loading. The addition of nanoparticles such as magnesium and calcium makes the HAZ grains finer in plate steel. This nanoparticle addition leads to an increase in weld strength. The increase in strength results in a smaller resource requirement because less material is required in order to keep stresses within allowable limits.&lt;ref name="Construction"/&gt;

===Wood===

Nanotechnology represents a major opportunity for the wood industry to develop new products, substantially reduce processing costs, and open new markets for biobased materials.

Wood is also composed of nanotubes or “nanofibrils”; namely, lignocellulosic (woody tissue) elements which are twice as strong as steel. Harvesting these nanofibrils would lead to a new paradigm in sustainable construction as both the production and use would be part of a renewable cycle. Some developers have speculated that building functionality onto lignocellulosic surfaces at the nanoscale could open new opportunities for such things as self-sterilizing surfaces, internal self-repair, and electronic lignocellulosic devices. These non-obtrusive active or passive nanoscale sensors would provide feedback on product performance and environmental conditions during service by monitoring structural loads, temperatures, moisture content, decay fungi, heat losses or gains, and loss of conditioned air. Currently, however, research in these areas appears limited.

Due to its natural origins, wood is leading the way in cross-disciplinary research and modelling techniques. BASF have developed a highly water repellent coating based on the actions of the lotus leaf as a result of the incorporation of silica and alumina nanoparticles and hydrophobic polymers. Mechanical studies of bones have been adapted to model wood, for instance in the drying process.&lt;ref name="Institute of Nanotechnology"/&gt;

===Glass===

Research is being carried out on the application of nanotechnology to glass, another important material in construction. Titanium dioxide (TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) nanoparticles are used to coat glazing since it has sterilizing and anti-fouling properties. The particles catalyze powerful reactions that break down organic pollutants, volatile organic compounds and bacterial membranes. TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is hydrophilic (attraction to water), which can attract rain drops that then wash off the dirt particles. Thus the introduction of nanotechnology in the Glass industry, incorporates the self-cleaning property of glass.&lt;ref name="Construction"/&gt;

Fire-protective glass is another application of nanotechnology. This is achieved by using a clear intumescent layer sandwiched between glass panels (an interlayer) formed of silica nanoparticles (SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), which turns into a rigid and opaque fire shield when heated. Most of glass in construction is on the exterior surface of buildings. So the light and heat entering the building through glass has to be prevented. The nanotechnology can provide a better solution to block light and heat coming through windows.&lt;ref name="Construction"/&gt;

===Coatings===

Coatings is an important area in construction coatings are extensively use to paint the walls, doors, and windows. Coatings should provide a protective layer bound to the base material to produce a surface of the desired protective or functional properties. The coatings should have self healing capabilities through a process of "self-assembly". Nanotechnology is being applied to paints to obtained the coatings having self healing capabilities and corrosion protection under insulation. Since these coatings are hydrophobic and repels water from the metal pipe and can also protect metal from salt water attack.&lt;ref name="Construction"/&gt;

Nanoparticle based systems can provide better adhesion and transparency. The TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; coating captures and breaks down organic and inorganic air pollutants by a photocatalytic process, which leads to putting roads to good environmental use.&lt;ref name="Construction"/&gt;

===Fire Protection and detection===

Fire resistance of steel structures is often provided by a coating produced by a spray-on-cementitious process. The nano-cement has the potential to create a new paradigm in this area of application because the resulting material can be used as a tough, durable, high temperature coating. It provides a good method of increasing fire resistance and this is a cheaper option than conventional insulation.&lt;ref name="Construction"/&gt;

===Risks in construction===

In building construction nanomaterials are widely used from self-cleaning windows to flexible solar panels to wi-fi blocking paint. The self-healing concrete, materials to block ultraviolet and infrared radiation, smog-eating coatings and light-emitting walls and ceilings are the new nanomaterials in construction. Nanotechnology is a promise for making the "smart home" a reality. Nanotech-enabled sensors can monitor temperature, humidity, and airborne toxins, which needs nanotech-based improved batteries. The building components will be intelligent and interactive since the sensor uses wireless components, it can collect the wide range of data.&lt;ref name="Construction"/&gt;

If nanosensors and nanomaterials become an everyday part of the buildings, as with [[smart home]]s, what are the consequences of these materials on human beings?&lt;ref name="Construction"/&gt;

#Effect of nanoparticles on health and environment: Nanoparticles may also enter the body if building water supplies are filtered through commercially available nanofilters. Airborne and waterborne nanoparticles enter from building ventilation and wastewater systems.&lt;ref name="Construction"/&gt;
#Effect of nanoparticles on societal issues: As sensors become commonplace, a loss of privacy and autonomy may result from users interacting with increasingly intelligent building components.&lt;ref name="Construction"/&gt;

==How it worked==
Infone included [[directory assistance]] and other services via a [[toll-free]] phone number. A user could call 888-411-1111 to request directory assistance, directions, traffic information, movie times, call completion, dinner reservation assistance and other services. 

Infone provided a number of innovative 411 '[[concierge]]' like services, including movie listings from a live operator, and offered a feature where they could provide information from a linked [[Microsoft Outlook]] calendar when set up in advance. For a period of time they advertised heavily on U.S. television, featuring ads with then [[Governor of Minnesota]] [[Jesse Ventura]], emphasizing their use of all U.S. based operators. The price offered was $0.89 per call up to 15 minutes (for use when the operator connects you to the requested number, as well as for additional information requests afterwards), with $0.05 for each additional minute, making Infone also a competitively priced long distance service. New users received 5-10 free calls.

Infone identified a registered user (along with billing information; the service was only payable by credit card) by caller ID (numbers were registered on signing up) and by an advanced voiceprint recognition system from [[SpeechWorks]] that identified the user when the user called from an un-registered telephone number (or no caller ID) through the use of a personal phrase spoken by the user (e.g., "Hello Infone!") after the welcome tone.

The '''International Association of Online Engineering''' (IAOE) is an international [[non-profit]] [[organization]] with the objective of encouraging the wider development, distribution and application of Online Engineering (OE) technologies and its influence to the society. The association seeks to foster practices in education and research in universities, higher education institutions and the industry on OE. Moreover, the IAOE promotes OE for the improvement of living and working conditions. The IAOE encourages the exchange of knowledge as well as the exchange of staff and students between co-operating institutions.

== Aim and Vision ==

IAOE proclaims a growing complexity of engineering tasks, increasingly specialized and expensive equipment as well as software tools and simulators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title =IAOE Focus|publisher=IAOE|url=http://online-engineering.org/focus.htm|accessdate = 2007-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also observes the necessary use of expensive equipment and software tools/simulators in short time projects. As a consequence, it is increasingly necessary to allow and organize a shared use of equipment, but also specialized software as for example [[simulators]].

Aims of the association in general are:
* to bundle the activities of the already existing community in the field of Online Engineering,
* spreading of up to date information and knowledge in the field of Online Engineering,
* organizing conferences and publications,
* provision of different services for the members,

The '''International Color Consortium''' ('''ICC''') was formed in 1993 by eight vendors in order to create an open, vendor-neutral [[color management]] system which would function transparently across all [[operating system]]s and software packages.

The ICC specification, currently on version 4.3,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.color.org/specification/ICC1v43_2010-12.pdf Specification ICC.1:2010-12 ], 2010 revision of the [[ICC profile]] standard&lt;/ref&gt; allows for matching of [[color]] when moved between applications and [[operating system]]s, from the point of creation to the final output, whether display or print.  This specification is technically identical to ISO 15076-1:2010, available from [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]].

The [[ICC profile]] which describe the color attributes of a particular device or viewing requirement by defining a mapping between the source or target [[color space]] and a ''profile connection space'' (PCS).

The ICC defines the format precisely but does not define algorithms or processing details. This means there is room for variation between different applications and systems that work with ICC profiles.

ICC has also published a preliminary specification for iccMAX, a next-generation color management architecture with significantly expanded functionality and a choice of colorimetric, spectral or material connection space. Details are at [http://www.color.org/iccmax/index.xalter http://www.color.org/iccmax/]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4952">In [[probability]] and [[statistics]], the '''K-distribution''' is a three-parameter family of continuous probability distributions. 
The distribution arises by compounding two [[gamma distribution]]s. In each case, a re-parametrization of the usual form of the family of gamma distributions is used, such that the parameters are:
:*the mean of the distribution, and
:*the usual shape parameter.

==Density==
The model is that [[random variable]] &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; has a gamma distribution with mean &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; and shape parameter &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;, with &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; being treated as a random variable having another gamma distribution, this time with mean &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; and shape parameter &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt;. The result is that &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; has the following [[probability density function]] (pdf) for &lt;math&gt;x&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;:&lt;ref name=Redding&gt;Redding (1999)&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;f_X(x;\mu,\nu,L)= \frac{2 \, \xi^{(\beta + 1)/2} x^{(\beta - 1)/2}}{\Gamma(L)\Gamma(\nu)} K_\alpha ( 2 \sqrt{\xi x}), &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\alpha = \nu-L,&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\beta = L + \nu - 1,&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\xi = L\nu/\mu ,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; is a [[modified Bessel function]] of the second kind. In this derivation, the K-distribution is a [[compound probability distribution]]. It is also a [[product distribution]]:&lt;ref name=Redding/&gt; it is the distribution of the product of two independent random variables, one having a gamma distribution with mean 1 and shape parameter &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;, the second having a gamma distribution with mean &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; and shape parameter &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt;. 

This distribution derives from a paper by [[Eric Jakeman]] and [[Peter Pusey]] (1978) who used it to model microwave sea echo. Jakeman and Tough (1987) derived the distribution from a biased random walk model. Ward (1981) derived the distribution from the product for two random variables, ''z'' = ''a'' ''y'', where ''a''  has a chi distribution and ''y'' a complex Gaussian distribution. The modulus of ''z'', ''|z|'', then has K distribution.

==Moments==
The moment generating function is given by&lt;ref&gt;Bithas (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; M_X(s) = \left(\frac{\xi}{s}\right)^{\beta/2} \exp \left( \frac{\xi}{2s} \right) W_{-\beta/2,\alpha/2} \left(\frac{\xi}{s}\right), &lt;/math&gt; 

where &lt;math&gt;W_{-\beta/2,\alpha/2}(\cdot)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Whittaker function]].

The n-th moments of K-distribution is given by&lt;ref name=Redding&gt;Redding (1999)&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \mu_n = \xi^{-n} \frac{\Gamma(L+n)\Gamma(\nu+n)}{\Gamma(L)\Gamma(\nu)}. &lt;/math&gt;
 
So the mean and variance are given&lt;ref name=Redding&gt;Redding (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; by
:&lt;math&gt; \operatorname{E}(X)= \mu  &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \operatorname{var}(X)= \mu^2 \frac{ \nu+L+1}{L \nu}  .&lt;/math&gt;

==Other properties==
All the properties of the distribution are symmetric in &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\nu.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name=Redding/&gt;

==Applications==
K-distribution arises as the consequence of a statistical or probabilistic model used in [[Synthetic aperture radar|Synthetic Aperture Radar]] (SAR) imagery. The K-distribution is formed by [[Compound probability distribution|compounding]] two separate [[probability distribution]]s, one representing the [[radar cross-section]], and the other representing speckle that is a characteristic of coherent imaging. It is also used in wireless communication to model composite fast fading and shadowing effects.

'''Kathryn Patricia "Kay" Hire''' (born August 26, 1959 in [[Mobile, Alabama]]) is a [[NASA]] [[astronaut]] and [[Captain (naval)|Captain]] in the [[United States Navy Reserve|U.S. Navy Reserve]] who has flown aboard two [[Space Shuttle]] missions.

==Education==
She attended [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Mobile#Elementary schools|St. Pius X Catholic Elementary School]], Mobile, Alabama, 1973 and [[Murphy High School (Alabama)|Murphy High School]], Mobile, Alabama, 1977.

She received her Bachelor of Science degree in Engineering and Management from the [[United States Naval Academy]], 1981 and her
Master of Science degree in Space Technology from [[Florida Institute of Technology]] in 1991.

==Experience==

===Navy experience===
After earning her [[Naval Flight Officer]] [[Naval Flight Officer insignia|wings]] in October 1982, Hire conducted worldwide airborne oceanographic research missions with Oceanographic Development Squadron Eight ([[VXN-8]]) based at [[NAS Patuxent River]], [[Maryland]]. She flew as Oceanographic Project Coordinator, Mission Commander and Detachment Officer-in-Charge on board specially configured [[P-3 Orion|RP-3A]] and [[P-3 Orion|RP-3D Orion]] aircraft.

Hire later instructed student naval flight officers while assigned to Naval Air Training Unit Mather (NAVAIRTU Mather), a tenant command associated with the [[323d Flying Training Wing]] at [[Mather Air Force Base]], [[California]].  While assigned to NAVAIRTU Mather, Hire progressed from Navigation Instructor and Course Manager to Curriculum Manager while concurrently assigned as a navigator flight instructor in the USAF [[Boeing T-43|T-43A]] aircraft.

In January 1989, Hire resigned her Regular Navy commission and left active duty, accepting a Reserve commission and joining the [[United States Navy Reserve|Naval Reserve]] at [[NAS Jacksonville]], [[Florida]]. Her initial tours of duty included Patrol Squadron Augment Unit VP-0545 and Anti-Submarine Warfare Operations Center 0574 and 0374.

Following the repeal of the [[Title 10 of the United States Code|Title 10 U.S.C.]] combat aircraft restriction for female military aviators in 1993, Hire was the first female in the U.S. military assigned to a combat aircrew, reporting to Patrol Squadron Sixty-Two ([[VP-62 (1970-present)|VP-62]]) on May 13, 1993 as a Navigator/Communicator flying the [[P-3 Orion|P-3C Update III Orion]] maritime patrol aircraft.  VP-62 was also based at NAS Jacksonville and Hire routinely deployed for flight operations throughout the North Atlantic, Europe and the Caribbean.

Hire later served with {{USS|Kitty Hawk|CV-63|6}} Detachment 0482, Tactical Support Center 0682, [[U.S. Seventh Fleet]] Detachment 111, and [[U.S. Naval Forces Central Command]] Detachment 108. Recalled to full-time active military duty from 2001 to 2003, Hire supported [[Operation Enduring Freedom]] and [[2003 invasion of Iraq|Operation Iraqi Freedom]] as a member of the Headquarters, [[U.S. Central Command]] Current Operations and Joint Operations Center (JOC) staffs at [[MacDill AFB]], Florida during Operation Enduring Freedom, followed by reassignment to the U.S. Naval Forces Central Command/[[U.S. Fifth Fleet]] staff for Operation Iraqi Freedom.  She was promoted to her current rank of Captain in the U.S. Navy on December 1, 2002.

===NASA experience===
Hire began work at the [[Kennedy Space Center]] in May 1989,first as an Orbiter Processing Facility 3 Activation Engineer and later as a Space Shuttle Orbiter Mechanical Systems Engineer for [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]] Space Operations Company. In 1991 she was certified as a [[Space Shuttle]] Test Project Engineer (TPE) and headed the checkout of the [[Extravehicular Mobility Unit]]s (spacesuits) and Russian Orbiter Docking System. She was assigned as Supervisor of Space Shuttle Orbiter Mechanisms and Launch Pad Swing Arms in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wsradio.com/wsradio-player.cfm/type/windows/show/Go-Navy-Radio/segment/8308.html Interview on Go Navy Radio] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928071419/http://www.wsradio.com/wsradio-player.cfm/type/windows/show/Go-Navy-Radio/segment/8308.html |date=2007-09-28 }} 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/Bios/htmlbios/hire.html|title=Astronaut Bio: Kay Hire (3/2010)|website=www.jsc.nasa.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spacefacts.de/bios/astronauts/english/hire_kathryn.htm|title=Astronaut Biography: Kathryn Hire|first=Joachim|last=Becker|website=www.spacefacts.de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Selected by NASA in December 1994, Hire reported to the [[Johnson Space Center]] in March 1995. After a year of training, she worked in mission control as a spacecraft communicator ([[capsule communicator|CAPCOM]]). Hire flew as Mission Specialist-2 on [[STS-90]] Neurolab (1998) and logged over 381 hours in space. She served as the Astronaut Office Lead for [[Shuttle Avionics Integration Laboratory]] (SAIL), Shuttle Payloads, and Flight Crew Equipment. Hire was assigned to the Astronaut Support Personnel (ASP) team for Kennedy Space Center Operations. She then journeyed to the [[International Space Station]] as a Mission Specialist for Space Shuttle mission [[STS-130]].

===Space flight experience===
'''[[STS-90]]''' Neurolab (April 17 – May 3, 1998). During the 16-day [[Spacelab]] flight, the seven-member crew aboard [[Space Shuttle Columbia|Space Shuttle ''Columbia'']] served as both experimental subjects and operators for 26 life science experiments focusing on the effects of [[microgravity]] on the [[brain]] and [[nervous system]]. The STS-90 flight orbited the Earth 256 times, and covered 6.3 million miles.

'''[[STS-130]]''' (February 8, 2010 – February 21, 2010) She also journeyed to the International Space Station as a Mission Specialist for Space Shuttle mission STS-130.

As of June 2018, Hire is considered a "NASA Management Astronaut", which means that she is employed at NASA but are no longer eligible for spaceflight assignments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nasa.gov/astronauts/biographies/management |title=NASA Management Astronauts |date=May 25, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kodaikanal [[mercury poisoning]] is a proven case of [[mercury contamination]] by ([[Hindustan Unilever]]) in the process of making mercury [[thermometer]]s for export around the world. The exposure of the environmental abuse led to the closure of the factory in 2001 and opened up a series of issues in India such as [[corporate liability]], [[corporate accountability]] and corporate negligence.

==Kodaikanal==
[[File:Kodai Lake.jpg|thumb|Kodaikanal Lake, the most popular tourist attraction, also contaminated&lt;ref&gt;The Hindu, 
# A study on water quality assessment on diatom indicators 
[http://www.hindu.com/2007/08/23/stories/2007082352980300.htm "Prevent mercury pollution”], (2007-8-23),&lt;/ref&gt;]]

[[Kodaikanal]] is a hill station located 7,000 feet above the sea level in the high ranges of [[Palani Hills]] in the Southern Indian state of [[Tamil Nadu]], often referred as Princess of Hill Stations. It is a popular vacation spot in Southern [[India]] with Indian and international tourists visiting the site in the summer months of March to June. Kodaikanal was established in 1845 by the [[British Raj]] as a place of escape from the high temperatures and [[tropical disease]]s of the plains. The region's economy thrives on tourism and a large number of hotels and restaurants have come up in the region following the growth of the hospitality industry. Kodaikanal also has the rare distinction of being home to Blue Kurinji (''[[Strobilanthes kunthiana]]''), flowering once in 12 years. The flowering season attracts tourists from around the world.

==Mercury and its effects==
[[Mercury (element)|Mercury]] is a [[Heavy metal (chemistry)|heavy metal]] and is commonly known as quicksilver. It is the only metal that is a liquid in standard condition of pressure and temperature. Heavy and silvery, mercury is dangerous to flora and fauna even in small doses. In human beings, continuous exposure to mercury leads to damage or impairment of the brain, kidneys and liver. Mercury is used for industrial purposes such as making [[thermometer]]s, [[barometers]], [[sphygmomanometers]], and [[fluorescent lamps]]. Of late, use of mercury-dependent devices have been phased out around the world and the industry has moved to digital devices replacing mercury devices.

==Mercury pollution in Kodaikanal==
The mercury contamination in [[Kodaikanal]] originated at a [[thermometer]] factory that was owned by [[Hindustan Unilever]]. [[Unilever]] acquired the thermometer factory from cosmetics maker [[Pond's|Pond's India Ltd.]] Pond's moved the factory from the United States to India in 1982 after the plant owned there by its parent, Chesebrough-Pond's, had to be dismantled following increased awareness in developed countries of polluting industries. In 1987, Pond's India and the thermometer factory went to Hindustan Unilever when it acquired Cheseborough-Pond's globally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Los Angeles |first=Times|title=Unilever Acquires Chesebrough Ponds Globally|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1986-12-02/business/fi-665_1_tender-offer|publisher=LA Times|accessdate=5 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The factory imported mercury from the United States, and exported finished thermometers to markets in the United States and Europe. Around 2001, a number of workers at the factory began complaining of [[kidney]] and related ailments. Public interest groups such as Tamil Nadu Alliance Against Mercury (TNAAC) alleged that the Company had been disposing mercury waste without following proper protocols. In early 2001, public interest groups unearthed a pile of broken glass thermometers with remains of Mercury from an interior of part of the [[shola]] forest, which they suspected could have come from the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lawrence M|first=Salinger|title=Encyclopedia of White-Collar &amp; Corporate Crime, Volume 1|url=http://www.sagepub.com/refbooks/Book226269|publisher=Sage Publications|accessdate=6 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March, a public protest led by local workers' union and international environmental organisation [[Greenpeace]] forced the company to shut down the factory. Soon the company admitted that it did dispose of mercury contaminated waste.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Basel Action Network|first=NGO|title=Hindustan Lever admits dumping Mercury Waste|url=http://ban.org/ban_news/hindustanlever.html|publisher=Ban NGO|accessdate=3 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Toxic|first=Link|title=Hindustan Lever Admits Dumping Mercury Waste|url=http://toxicslink.org/?q=article/hindustan-lever-admits-dumping-mercury-containing-wastes|publisher=Toxic Link|accessdate=3 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company said in its 2002 annual report and its latest Sustainability Report that it did not dump glass waste contaminated with mercury on the land behind its factory, but only a quantity of 5.3 metric tonnes of glass containing 0.15% residual mercury had been sold to a scrap recycler located about three kilometers from the factory, in breach of the company procedures. Quoting a report prepared by an international environmental consultant, Unilever said there was no health effect on the workers of the factory&lt;ref name="Unilever report update"&gt;{{cite web|title=Update on Kodai for online sustainability report for Unilever.com|url=http://www.hul.co.in/Images/Update_on_Erstwhile_Kodaikanal_Factory_tcm114-195572.pdf|accessdate=5 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; or any impact on the environment.&lt;ref name="URS Dames &amp; Moore"&gt;{{cite web|title=HINDUSTAN LEVER LIMITED Report and Accounts 2002|url=http://www.hul.co.in/Images/AnnualReport2002_tcm114-309426.pdf|accessdate=5 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reverse dumping==
Once the factory was shut down, public interest groups demanded the return of the remaining mercury waste to the United States for recycling, remediation of the factory site, and address of the health complaints of the workers. Local groups and workers' union under the leadership of [[Greenpeace]], represented to the company, regulatory bodies, and the government, besides initiating legal action against the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=The Hindu|first=Business Line|title=Mercury Waste to Leave for NY|url=http://www.thehindubusinessline.in/2003/05/05/stories/2003050501700300.htm|publisher=The Hindu|accessdate=5 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Greenpeace campaigner Ameer Shahul led the public affairs groups and workers collaboration in forcing the Company to collect 290 tonnes of dumped mercury waste from the shola forest and send back to the United States for recycling in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=New York|first=Times|title=Unilever's Mercury Waste Sends Backs to the US|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/05/07/world/hazardous-waste-is-shipped-from-india-to-us-recycling-plant.html|publisher=NY Times|accessdate=5 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=High|first=Beam|title=Mercury Waste Sends Back to the US|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-73787744.html|publisher=High Beam|accessdate=5 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was widely hailed by the media as ‘reverse dumping’.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Times of India|first=New Delhi|title=First Ever Case of Reverse Dumping|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2003-04-17/india/27275673_1_thermometer-factory-mercury-pollution-mercury-contamination|publisher=Times of India|accessdate=5 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later Greenpeace campaigners Ameer Shahul and Navroz Mody led the groups in lobbying for remediation of the site&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fernando|first=A C|title=Business Ethics And Corporate Governance|date=1 Sep 2010|publisher=Pearson Education India|location=New Delhi|page=9.14|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_32bJs_nfNIC&amp;pg=SA9-PA14&amp;lpg=SA9-PA14&amp;dq=Navroz+Mody,+Ameer+Shahul+Greenpeace&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=7gbY3EKBb6&amp;sig=sPNTWCdZojs7O6nhbwkTgPnN94w&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=NdzxUo_eIYHZige_nYCIBg&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Navroz%20Mody%2C%20Ameer%20Shahul%20Greenpeace&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; and initiated an investigation by the [[Department of Atomic Energy]] of [[Government of India]], which found that the free mercury level in the atmosphere of Kodaikanal was 1000 times more than what is found in normal conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Journal|first=Environmental Pollution|title=Studies of mercury pollution in a lake due to a thermometer factory situated in Kodaikkanal|publisher=Elsevier|accessdate=6 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Deccan|first=Herald|title=Closed Unilver factory source of Mercury Pollution|url=http://archive.deccanherald.com/Deccanherald/jan172004/n9.asp|publisher=Deccan Herald|accessdate=5 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Greenpeace|first=International|title=Mercury Levels in Kodai still High|url=http://www.greenpeace.org/india/en/news/the-department-of-atomic-resea/|publisher=Greenpeace|accessdate=5 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Analysis of water, sediment and fish samples collected from Kodaikanal Lake by a team of scientists of the Department of Atomic Energy showed elevated levels of mercury four years after the stoppage of mercury emissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Journal|first=Environmental Pollution|title=Mercury pollution in a lake due to a thermometer factory situated in Kodaikkanal|url=http://www.journals.elsevier.com/environmental-pollution/|publisher=Elsevier|accessdate=6 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A series of scientific studies have also been carried out by Governmental and non-governmental organisations to determine the extent of damage caused to the environment and to the people who were exposed to mercury in the factory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cuddalore|first=SIPCOT|title=Studies and Reports on environmental pollution and public health hazard caused by Hindustan Lever in Kodaikanal|url=http://www.sipcotcuddalore.com/Kodaikanal/studies.htm|publisher=SipcotCuddalore|accessdate=6 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Remediation of the site==
Greenpeace and workers' unions continued to mount pressure on the company to take responsibility for the dumping crimes it had committed and for meddling with a pristine environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Greenpeace|first=International|title=Prosecute HLL for Forest Crimes|url=http://www.greenpeace.org/india/en/news/prosecute-hll-for-forest-crime/|publisher=Greenpeace|accessdate=5 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; They asked the regulatory bodies to prosecute the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Greenpeace|first=International|title=Prosecute HLL|url=http://www.greenpeace.org/india/en/news/greenpeace-calls-on-hindustan/|publisher=Greenpeace|accessdate=5 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; With these demands, public interest groups led by Greenpeace campaign head Shahul spooked the annual general body meeting of [[Hindustan Unilever]] in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Greenpeace|first=International|title=Greenpeace Spooks Hindustan Unilever Annual General Body Meeting|url=http://www.greenpeace.org/india/en/news/greenpeace-spooks-hll-agm-dem/|publisher=Greenpeace|accessdate=5 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, the company began working with the regulatory body Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board (TNPCB) to remediate the soil, de-contaminate and scrap the thermometer-making equipment at the Kodaikanal site. The company appointed [[National Environmental Engineering Research Institute]] (NEERI) to finalise the scope for remediation, which was vehemently opposed by environmentalists. In 2006, the plant, machinery and materials used in thermometer manufacturing at the site were decontaminated and disposed off as scrap to industrial recyclers. In the following year, NEERI conducted trials at the factory for remediation of the contaminated soil on site, and recommended a remediation protocol of soil washing and thermal retorting. These were hotly contested by environmental groups under the leadership of Nityanand Jayaraman. Ultimately, the [[Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board]] (TNPCB) recommended a remediation standard of up to 20&amp;nbsp;mg/kg of mercury concentration in soil, which means 95% of the samples analysed after the remediation process should be of less than 20&amp;nbsp;mg/kg. Consequently, pre-remediation work started in May 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Unilever|first=Inc|title=Facts About Kodaikanal Thermometer Factory|url=http://www.unilever.com/sustainable-living/Respondingtostakeholderconcerns/India/|publisher=Unilever|accessdate=5 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Public interest groups contested the soil clean-up criteria and alleged that TNPCB is helping Unilever clean up to lower standards to cut costs. The acceptable mercury level being suggested by TNPCB is at least 20 times higher than what Unilever would have been required to do if they had caused the same contamination in the United Kingdom, where they are based. They also called for transparency and public participation in the process of deciding the levels of clean-up and in the process of clean-up.

==Workers' health problems==
After the shut down of the factory, health specialists from Bangalore-based Community Health Centre conducted a survey among the former workers of the factory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Health|first=Problems|title=Workers Health Issues due to Mercury Exposure|url=http://www.indiatogether.org/environment/articles/unilever.htm|publisher=India Together|accessdate=5 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It found that former workers of the factory had visible signs of [[mercury poisoning]] such as gum and skin allergy and related problems, ‘which appeared to be due to exposure to mercury'.

The company claims&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kodaikanal Mercury Factory – Contamination Response, India|url=http://www.hul.co.in/mediacentre/newsandfeatures/2015/Kodaikanal-India.aspx|website=Hindustan Unilever Limited|accessdate=9 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Latest response from HUL|url=https://www.unilever.com/news/news-and-features/2015/update-on-Kodaikanal-India.html|accessdate=14 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; that comprehensive [[occupational safety and health]] systems existed at the Kodaikanal factory prior to its closure in 2001. Internal monitoring within the factory and external audits carried out by statutory authorities during the operations of the factory showed that there were no adverse health effects to the workers on account of their employment at the factory. It says there had been a comprehensive medical examination conducted by a panel of doctors using a questionnaire developed by Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) of the [[United States Department of Labor]]; a study by the Certifying Surgeon from the Inspectorate of Factories; an assessment by Dr P N Viswanathan of [[Indian Institute of Toxicology Research]] (IITR); a study by Dr Tom van Teuenbroek of TNO; and a study by IITR, formerly known as Industrial Toxicology Research Centre(ITRC) as directed by a Monitoring Committee set up by the [[Supreme Court of India]].

The company says its conclusions of its occupational health surveillance were also endorsed by the [[All India Institute of Medical Sciences]] (AIIMS) and the [[National Institute of Occupational Health]] (NIOH).

In February 2006, a group of ex-employees of the factory approached the [[Madras High Court]] seeking directions for conducting a fresh health survey and providing economic rehabilitation. A year later, the [[Madras High Court]] constituted a five-member expert committee, with representatives from ITRC, AIIMS and NIOH to decide whether the alleged health conditions of the workers and their families were related to mercury exposure, and recommend whether there was need for a new health study. The Committee after examining the ex-workers, questioning the [[Hindustan Unilever]] Limited (HUL) officials and after a visit to the factory in October 2007 submitted its report suggesting that there is "no sufficient evidence to link the current clinical condition of the factory workers to the mercury exposure in the factory in the past". Accepting the report, the Madras High Court ruled out the need for any fresh health study. In the meantime, the [[Ministry of Labour and Employment (India)|Ministry of Labour and Employment]], which is also a respondent in the case before the Madras High Court conducted a detailed study by a team comprising experts from various fields found that there is [[prima facie]] evidence to suggest that not only the workers of the factory, but even the children of the workers, have suffered because of exposure to mercury. The Ministry submitted its report to the Madras High Court in 2011. It also recommended setting up a Board to examine the extent of damage or disability suffered by workers and their children because of exposure to mercury, and based on the assessment of the Board workers can approach the Employment Compensation Commissioner to seek compensation. The case before the Madras High Court is still to be decided.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Unilever|title=Workers Health Issues and Unilever's Stand|url=http://www.unilever.com/sustainable-living/Respondingtostakeholderconcerns/India/|publisher=Unilever|accessdate=5 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''LOMO''' ({{lang-ru|Ленинградское Oптико-Mеханическое Oбъединение|Leningradskoye Optiko-Mekhanicheskoye Obyedinenie|Leningrad Optical Mechanical Association}}) is a manufacturer of medical and motion-picture lenses and equipment based in [[St. Petersburg]], Russia. The company was awarded three [[Order of Lenin]] decorations by the [[Soviet Union]].

Its [[Lomo LC-A]] consumer camera was the inspiration for the [[lomography]] photographic movement.

==History==
[[File:LOMO Lubitel-166.jpg|thumb|100px|right|Lubitel 166 Universal twin-lens reflex 120 still camera]]
[[File:Lomo lc-a.JPG|thumb|100px|[[LOMO LC-A]]]]

The company was founded in 1914 in Petrograd (now [[Saint Petersburg]]).

It was established as a French – Russian limited company to produce lenses and cameras. It manufactured gun sights during [[World War I]]. In 1919, it was nationalised. In the ensuing years, the state optical industries were reorganised several times. In 1921, the factory was named the Factory of State Optics, G.O.Z. In 1925, camera production was resumed, and several lens designs tested between 1925 and 1929.  In 1928, the factory was ordered to manufacture a 9x12 camera, known as the FOTOKOR.

Further reorganisations of the Soviet optical factories in several stages finally resulted in that the factory at Leningrad became GOMZ, the Russian Optical and Mechanical Factory.

In the transition period 1932 to 1935 a copy of the [[Leica camera]] was developed, the VOOMP I. It was followed by the VOOMP II or the "Pioneer" that was manufactured in small numbers. Simultaneously designers began the development of a single-lens reflex camera for 35mm cine film, possibly inspired by similar work in Germany, especially at Zeiss Ikon in Dresden, since the lens mount is quite similar to that of the Contax cameras of the time. Zeiss themselves were not allowed to pursue their ideas, due to the German armament.  The new camera, called the [[Sport (camera)|"Sport"]], was introduced at about the same time as the [[Exakta|Ihagee Kine Exakta]] in 1936.

Today LOMO makes [[military]] optics, scientific research instruments, criminological microscopes, medical equipment, and a range of consumer products. It produced the first Russian [[camera]] in 1930.

Known as GOMZ (State Optical-Mechanical Plant), the company was transformed under the direction of [[Mikhail Panfilov]], who united several industries and founded the LOMO Association in 1962. Panfilov was the General Director until 1984, when he retired and was replaced by [[Georgy Khizha]] as Director General. In 1990 - 1997 [[Ilya Klebanov]] was the Director General of LOMO Association.

Amateur movie equipment brands were LOMO and AVRORA for cameras and Russ for projectors. Ritm is also used after LOMO for professional sound equipment. It produced the one and only Super 8 sound camera and projector in the USSR. It was also the main Soviet producer for professional grade cine lenses, including [[Anamorphic format|anamorphic]] lenses.

The company went public in 1993, and was renamed LOMO PLC; it is traded on the [[RTS Index|RTS]] Classic Stock Market.

The company is [[ISO 9001]] certified and exports worldwide. Night-vision devices and telescopes account for 30% of the company's exports. Germany is the largest importer of LOMO products. Medical equipment, fiber optic cables and Endoscopes, optical components and cameras are consumed mainly by the Russian market and other states of the former [[Soviet Union]]. Military equipment and science research instruments make a significant share of production for export to such countries as Israel, India, United States, Canada, Mexico, and other international markets.

Its [[Maksutov telescope]] range is highly regarded by [[amateur astronomy|amateur astronomers]].

The word LOMO is often used to refer to the [[Lomo LC-A]] and other LOMO branded consumer cameras; while the cameras have a large following around the world, the cameras themselves are a minor product for LOMO PLC.

LOMO is also currently a manufacturer of die-cast models in 1:43 scale.  LOMO factory mass-produces 1:43 scale models of the 1930s-1950s vehicles on AMO, ZiS, ZiL and GAZ chassis.

==Social standing==
LOMO is regarded in St. Petersburg for its advanced medical centre, with well equipped facilities for advanced treatment of a range of medical conditions. LOMO medical centre has a steady reputation in general surgery and trauma, oncology and radiology, OB/GYN, pediatrics, physical therapy and other specialties of medicine.

Medical instruments, such as Endoscopes and Surgical Microscopes made by LOMO are used by the doctors at LOMO medical centre, thus providing prompt feedback from doctors to engineers and designers of medical equipment.

A '''lawn aerator''' is a [[garden tool]] designed to create holes in the [[soil]] in order to help [[lawn|lawn grasses]] grow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How to Use a Gas Aerator|url=http://homeguides.sfgate.com/use-gas-aerator-97557.html|website=SFGate|publisher=Hearst Communications, Inc.|accessdate=20 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In compacted lawns, [[aeration]] improves [[soil drainage]] and encourages [[worm]]s, [[microfauna]] and [[microflora]] which require [[oxygen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lauderdale|first1=Danny|last2=Roberson|first2=Sarah|title=Happy Gardening!

==Lawn problems==
Lawn aeration constitutes three things: controlling lawn thatch, and reducing soil compaction, making grass roots multiply. Aerating either by coring or spiking causes the roots to divide or sever apart. This is something rarely done naturally. By severing roots it makes the roots multiply. When roots multiply the blades multiply thereby keeping the lawn thick and rooting deeply. the holes become engorged with roots. Lawn thatch is a layer of dead organic tissue that can protect the lawn by moderating temperature and reducing evapotranspiration when it is a reasonable thickness, but too much thatch can limit soil oxygenation and reduce watering effectiveness. Soil compaction makes it difficult for grass to develop long roots and disturbs both natural rainwater and artificial [[irrigation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tukey|first1=Paul|title=The Organic Lawn Care Manual|date=2007|publisher=Storey Publishing|isbn=1580176496|pages=97-98|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Yg1aAgAAQBAJ|accessdate=20 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two types of lawn aerators. Spike aerators use wedge shaped solid spikes to punch holes in the soil, and core aerators have hollow tines that pull out plugs (or "cores") from soil. 

[[File:Curved Spike Aerator.jpg|thumb|Curved spike aerator]]
'''Core/plug aerator vs. spike aerator'''

A spike aerator creates holes in the ground by pushing the soil sideways as wedge-shaped spikes penetrate the soil. Since there is no soil removed from the ground, watering will cause the compacted soil around the holes to expand and close. A core/plug aerator removes soil from the ground and leaves the core on the turf. This reduces compaction in the soil, and the holes can stay open for a long time allowing air, fertilisers, and water to reach the roots. Core aeration is suitable for heavy clay soils, and spike aeration is more suited to sandy or loamy soils.

'''Powered aerator vs. manual aerator'''

[[File:AIREADORA 04.JPG|thumb|Powered core aerator in use]]
Powered aerators employ the power from ground propulsion to drive multiple tines into ground.  The machines can aerate a large lawn in a relatively short time (similar to mowing speed).

Manual aerators usually have two to five hollow tines mounted on a step bar.  The operator puts one foot on the step bar and push it downward, forcing the tines to penetrate into the soil.  Then he pulls the handle on the step bar upward to remove the soil cores out of the ground.  By repeating the same operation, the cores left in the tines will be pushed out by the next ones.  Manual aerators are much cheaper than powered ones.  The trade-off is the speed.  For a typical residential lawn (1/4 acre lot), it will take hours to finish.  Some products also have issues with the tines becoming clogged with soil, which can slow down the operation even more.  However, a well-made manual aerator offers advantages such as ease of use, selective aeration, and economy.

'''Malibu Hydro System''' was designed to provide [[electricity]] to the [[Malibu Club in Canada]].  This hydro system starts from a high alpine lake where water is diverted from the lake through a [[steel]] [[penstock]] to a power house nearly {{convert|1250|ft|m}} below near the shore of [[Jervis Inlet]].  The flow of water turns a pelton wheel which is attached to a generator to create electricity. The electricity is then transmitted to camp by a submarine cable running under Jervis Inlet at a high voltage to reduce losses. Power is then distributed throughout camp on the existing and upgraded electrical system.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.malibuhydro.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sources ==
The hydro turbine is feed by a yearlong creek called McCannel Creek, which is directly across Jervis Inlet from Malibu.  The creek's source is McCannel Lake, at an elevation of {{convert|2600|ft|m}}.  At the outlet of the lake, a dam was built to maintain the lake level and control the flow of the creek.

[[Image:PowerFlow.jpg|thumb|Malibu Hydro flow diagram]]

== Weir (Item A) ==
A small weir type dam was built at the lake outlet, and, by limiting the discharge into the creek, aids in maintaining the lake level. The weir has a large pipe and valve in its base to pass the minimum {{convert|2|cuft/s|m3/s}} required to maintain the creek. This is in addition to the water which will be spilled to create power.

== Intake (Item B) ==
Water regulated at the lake will flow down the creek from the {{convert|2300|ft|m|adj=on}} level to the {{convert|1200|ft|m|adj=on}} level. Here a second weir was built across the creek that forms a large deep pool from which the {{convert|12|in|mm|adj=on}} penstock draws water at a rate of up to {{convert|7|cuft/s|m3/s|abbr=on}}.

== Power House (Item C &amp; D) ==
The power house contains the turbine, generator, and the necessary equipment to control and distribute the electricity for Malibu. It is located a short distance above the beach. The following diagram and table explains what happens once the water flow reaches the Power house (read the diagram right to left)

== Power Line (Item E) ==
Transformers at the hydro generator raise 600 volts to 15,000 volts for transmission. Power is transmitted  across Jervis inlet, a distance of two miles (3&amp;nbsp;km) via a underwater power line consisting of three parallel conductors.  On the Malibu side of the inlet, a transformer steps the 15,000 volts down to 120 and 208 volts for use at the camp.

==History==
It began installation in 2005.

'''Mitchum''' is a brand of [[deodorant|antiperspirant-deodorant]], later owned by [[Revlon]]. It was widely known for its [[marketing]] [[slogan]], "So effective you can skip a day," but that slogan hasn't been used since 2007.

Mitchum is a brand that was purchased by the Revlon Corporation in the late sixties. Originally known as the Paris Toilet Company and then the Golden Peacock Company,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://americanhistory.si.edu/collections/search/object/nmah_716460 |title=Golden Peacock Shampoo &amp;#124; National Museum of American History |publisher=Americanhistory.si.edu |date=2012-12-17 |accessdate=2015-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; the company carried a full line of cosmetics. Bill McNutt&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ewgrove.com/prhnpic/honors/mcnuttbi.htm |title=Bill McNutt ~ Feature News Article |publisher=Ewgrove.com |date=2004-07-13 |accessdate=2015-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; is credited with inventing the antiperspirant. Other products launched by Mitchum, include "Esoterica" which helped with removing age spots. Before the company was sold to Revlon, it had existed for two generations and was headquartered in [[Paris, Tennessee]].

All versions of their product used to contain 20% of the antiperspirant [[Aluminium zirconium tetrachlorohydrex gly]] and the roll-on still does. In 2007, they re-branded their entire line with a new active ingredient, [[Aluminum sesquichlorohydrate]] 25%.  They went on to release a Smart Solid line, a water-based solid with a differing texture than most deodorants, that contained the original active ingredient.  A standard invisible solid was released with the old active ingredient as well, with the name "Mitchum Advanced Control".

During the 1990 media controversy surrounding [[Arthur Scargill]]'s handling of money donated for striking British miners, Mitchum used an image of the [[National Union of Mineworkers (Great Britain)|NUM]] leader, without his consent, under the slogan "Mitchum, for when you're really sweating!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Routledge |first=Paul |date=1994 |title=Scargill: the unauthorized biography |location=London |publisher=Harper Collins |pages=226 |isbn=0-00-638077-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Scargill complained to the UK's Advertising Standards Association who criticised the advertisement as "highly distasteful".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Routledge |first=Paul |date=1994 |title=Scargill: the unauthorized biography |location=London |publisher=Harper Collins |pages=229 |isbn=0-00-638077-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:CADPAT digital camouflage pattern (Temperate Woodland variant).jpg|upright|thumb|228px|The [[Canadian Forces]] were the first army to issue [[pixellated]] digital multi-scale [[military camouflage|camouflage]] for all units with their disruptively patterned [[CADPAT]], issued in 2002, shown here in its 'Temperate Woodland' variant.]]
{{Use British English|date=April 2014}}

'''Multi-scale camouflage''' is a type of [[military camouflage]] combining patterns at two or more scales, often (though not necessarily) with a '''digital camouflage''' pattern created with computer assistance. The function is to provide [[camouflage]] over a range of distances, or equivalently over a [[scale invariance|range of scales]] (scale-invariant camouflage), in the manner of [[fractal]]s, so some approaches are called '''fractal camouflage'''. Not all multiscale patterns are [[pixellated|composed of rectangular pixels]], even if they were designed using a computer. Further, not all pixellated patterns work at different scales, so being pixellated or digital does not of itself guarantee improved performance.

The first standardized pattern to be issued was the single-scale Italian ''[[telo mimetico]]''. The root of the modern multi-scale camouflage patterns can be traced back to 1930s experiments in Europe for the [[Bundeswehr|German]] and [[Red Army|Soviet]] armies. This was followed by Canadian development of Canadian Disruptive Pattern ([[CADPAT]]), first issued in 2002, and then with US work which created Marine pattern ([[MARPAT]]), launched between 2002 and 2004.

==Principle==
[[File:Army Combat Uniform.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The [[Universal Camouflage Pattern]] provided insufficient contrast to [[disruptive coloration|disrupt]] a soldier's outline effectively, appearing at a moderate distance as a single colour.]]

===Scale invariance===
The scale of camouflage patterns is related to their function. Large structures need larger patterns than individual soldiers to disrupt their shape. At the same time, large patterns are more effective from afar, while small scale patterns work better up close.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Craemer | first=Guy | title=Dual Texture - U.S. Army digital camouflage | url=http://www.uniteddynamics.com/dualtex/ | publisher=United Dynamics Corp. | accessdate=27 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional single scale patterns work well in their optimal range from the observer, but an observer at other distances will not see the pattern optimally. Nature itself is very often [[fractal]], where plants and rock formations exhibit similar [[Patterns in nature|patterns]] across several magnitudes of scale. The idea behind multi-scale patterns is both to mimic the [[self-similar]]ity of nature, and also to offer [[scale invariance|scale invariant]] or so-called fractal camouflage.&lt;ref name="Hambling2012"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Hambling |first1=David |title=Invisibility cloaks are almost a reality with fractal-camouflage clothing |url=https://www.wired.co.uk/article/hiding-in-plain-sight |work=Wired |issue=June 2012 |date=8 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Vergun |first=David |title=Army testing combat boots, camouflage patterns |url=http://www.army.mil/article/121866/Army_testing_combat_boots__camouflage_patterns/ |publisher=United States Army |accessdate=28 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Flounder camo md (cropped).jpg|thumb|A [[flounder]]'s [[disruptive coloration|disruptive]] and [[active camouflage]]]]

Animals such as the [[flounder]] have the ability to [[active camouflage|adapt their camouflage patterns]] to suit the background, and they do so extremely effectively,&lt;ref name=Akkaynak/&gt; selecting patterns that match the spatial scales of the current background.&lt;ref name=Akkaynak&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Akkaynak |first1=Derek|display-authors=etal |title=Changeable camouflage: how well can flounder resemble the colour and spatial scale of substrates in their natural habitats? |journal=Royal Society Open Science |date=March 2017 |issue=4 |page=160824 |doi=10.1098/rsos.160824 |quote=Our results show that all flounder and background spectra fall within the same colour gamut and that, in terms of different observer visual systems, flounder matched most substrates in luminance and colour contrast. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Design trade-offs===
[[File:Scorpion W2, Operational Camouflage Pattern (OCP) swatch.png|thumb|[[Operational Camouflage Pattern]], a disruptive but non-pixellated pattern, replacing the Universal Camouflage Pattern from 2015]]

When a pattern is called digital, this most often means that it is visibly composed of computer-generated [[pixel]]s.&lt;ref name="Hyperstealth"&gt;{{cite web |author=Craemer, Guy |title=CADPAT or MARPAT Camouflage |publisher=Hyperstealth |work=Who did it first; Canada or the US? |url=http://www.hyperstealth.com/CADPAT-MARPAT.htm |year=2007 |accessdate=February 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is sometimes also used of computer generated patterns like the non-pixellated [[Multicam]] and the Italian fractal ''Vegetato'' pattern.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Strikehold |title=Making Sense of Digital Camouflage |year=2010 |url=http://www.strikehold.net/2010/04/04/making-sense-of-digital-camouflage/ |publisher=Strikehold |accessdate=2 September 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121130142620/http://www.strikehold.net/2010/04/04/making-sense-of-digital-camouflage/ |archivedate=30 November 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Neither pixellation nor digitization contribute to the camouflaging effect. The pixellated style, however, simplifies design and eases printing on fabric, compared to traditional patterns. While digital patterns are becoming widespread, critics maintain that the pixellated look is a question of fashion rather than function.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Engber, D. |title=Lost in the Wilderness, the military's misadventures in pixellated camouflage |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/science/2012/07/camouflage_problems_in_the_army_the_ucp_and_the_future_of_digital_camo_.single.html |accessdate=27 September 2012 |newspaper=Slate |date=5 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The design process involves trading-off different factors, including colour, contrast and overall disruptive effect. A failure to consider all elements of pattern design tends to result in poor results. The US Army's [[Universal Camouflage Pattern]] (UCP), for example, adopted after limited testing in 2003–4, performed poorly because of low pattern contrast ("isoluminance"—beyond very close range, the design looks like a field of solid light grey, failing to [[disruptive coloration|disrupt]] an object's outlines) and arbitrary colour selection, neither of which could be saved by quantizing (digitizing) the pattern geometry.&lt;ref name=WTW&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hu |first1=Caitlin |title=The Art and Science of Military Camouflage |url=https://worksthatwork.com/7/the-art-and-science-of-military-camouflage |journal=Works That Work |issue=7 |date=2016 |accessdate=8 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT /&gt; The design was replaced from 2015 with [[Operational Camouflage Pattern]], a non-pixellated pattern.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.army.mil/article/121866/Army_testing_combat_boots__camouflage_patterns/ |title=Army testing combat boots, camouflage patterns |publisher=U.S. Army |date=31 March 2014 |accessdate=22 April 2014 |author=Vergun, David}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Army396739"&gt;{{cite web |title=Army Combat Uniform Summary of Changes |url=https://www.army.mil/e2/c/downloads/396739.pdf |publisher=US Army |accessdate=1 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Wartime Italian M1929.jpg|thumb|upright|Italian ''[[Telo mimetico]]'', first used in 1929]]

===Interwar development in Europe===

The idea of patterned camouflage extends back to the [[interwar period]] in Europe. The first printed camouflage pattern was the 1929 Italian ''[[telo mimetico]]'', which used irregular areas of three colours at a single scale.&lt;ref name=Verny&gt;{{cite web |last1=Verny |first1=Eric |last2=Bocek |first2=Jonathan |title=Italian Camouflage |url=http://www.dererstezug.com/italiancamo.htm |publisher=Der Erste Zug |accessdate=14 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===German WWII experiments===
[[File:Waffen-SS Camouflage.jpg|thumb|[[Waffen-SS]] 1944 ''[[Erbsenmuster]]'' (pea-dot pattern) combines large and small scale patterns.]]
{{main|German World War II camouflage patterns}}

During the Second World War, [[Johann Georg Otto Schick]]{{efn|Schick (1882–) was a professor in Munich in the 1930s, and from 1935 director of the newly formed camouflage department (named "T" for "Tarnung", camouflage).}} designed [[German World War II camouflage patterns|a series of patterns]] such as ''[[Platanenmuster]]'' (plane tree pattern) and ''[[erbsenmuster]]'' (pea-dot pattern) for the [[Waffen-SS]], combining micro- and macro-patterns in one scheme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Peterson | first=D. | title=Waffen-SS Camouflage Uniforms and Post-war Derivatives |year=2001 |publisher=Crowood. | isbn=978-1-86126-474-9 |page=64}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Schick, Johann Georg Otto (1882-)|url=http://kalliope-verbund.info/de/eac?eac.id=1047595591|publisher=Kalliope-Verbund|accessdate=29 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Bundeswehr|German Army]] developed the idea further in the 1970s into [[Flecktarn]], which combines smaller shapes with dithering; this softens the edges of the large scale pattern, making the underlying objects harder to discern.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Turner | first=B. | title=1938 amoeba pattern, green base | url=http://www.kamouflage.net/camouflage/00068.php | publisher=Kamouflage.net | accessdate=28 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Soviet WWII experiments===

Pixel-like shapes pre-date [[computer-aided design]] by many years, already being used in Soviet Union experiments with camouflage patterns, such as "TTsMKK"{{efn|TTsMKK ({{lang-ru|ТЦМКК}}) is short for "three-colour disguise camouflage suit" ("трёхцветный маскировочный камуфлированный костюм", ''tryokhtsvetniy maskirovochniy kamuflirovanniy kostyum'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Dougherty|first= Martin J.|year=2017 |chapter= Chapter 2: Infantry Camouflage in the Modern Era |chapter-url= https://books.google.com/books?id=W7h2DgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA69 |editor1-last=Spilling |editor1-first=Michael |title= Camouflage At War: An Illustrated Guide from 1914 to the Present Day|location= London |publisher=Amber Books Ltd. |page= 69|isbn= 978-1-78274-498-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} developed in 1944 or 1945.

===1976 research by Timothy O'Neill===

In 1976, [[Timothy O'Neill (camoufleur)|Timothy O'Neill]] created a pixellated pattern named "Dual-Tex". He called the digital approach "texture match". The initial work was done by hand on a retired M113 [[armoured personnel carrier]]; O'Neill painted the pattern on with a 2-inch (5 centimetre) roller, forming squares of colour by hand. Field testing showed that the result was good compared to the U. S. Army's existing [[List of military clothing camouflage patterns|camouflage patterns]], and O'Neill went on to become an instructor and camouflage researcher at [[West Point]] military academy.&lt;ref name=Fusco2010&gt;{{cite web |last1=Fusco |first1=Vincent |title=West Point explores science of camouflage |url=https://www.army.mil/article/40245/West_Point_explores_science_of_camouflage |publisher=U.

===2000s fractal-like digital patterns===
[[File:Buxus sempervirens foliage 1.jpg|thumb|left|[[Patterns in nature]], like the [[foliage]] of this ''[[Buxus sempervirens]]'' bush, are often broken into visual elements with small and large scales, such as branches and leaves.]]

By 2000, development was under way to create pixellated camouflage patterns for [[battledress]] like the [[Canadian Forces]]' [[CADPAT]], issued in 2002, and then the US Marines' [[MARPAT]], rolled out between 2002 and 2004. The CADPAT and MARPAT patterns were somewhat [[self-similarity|self-similar]] (in the manner of fractals and patterns in nature such as vegetation), being designed to work at two different scales; a genuinely fractal pattern would be statistically similar at all scales. A target camouflaged with MARPAT takes about 2.5 times longer to detect than older [[NATO]] camouflage which worked at only one scale, while recognition, which begins after detection, took 20 percent longer than with older camouflage.&lt;ref name=Andrews&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=arPl5bUyIVoC&amp;pg=PA100 | work=What Visual Discrimination of Fractal Textures Can Tell Us about Discrimination of Camouflaged Targets | title=Human Factors Issues in Combat Identification | publisher=Ashgate | author=Billock, Vincent A; Cunningham, Douglas W.; Tsou, Brian H.

Okolloh was born into a relatively poor family.&lt;ref name="ind"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/sustainit/modern-networker-using-ict-to-change-kenyan-life-for-the-better-1640467.html|title=Modern networker: using ICT to change Kenyan life for the better|last=Hogg|first=Care Dwyer|date=2009-03-10|work=[[The Independent]]|accessdate=2009-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ted"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/ory_okolloh_on_becoming_an_activist.html|title=Ory Okolloh on becoming an activist|last=Okolloh|first=Ory|date=June 2007|work=[[TED Talks]]|accessdate=2009-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She has said that her parents sent her to a private elementary school that they could "barely afford," which "set the foundation for what ended up being my career."&lt;ref name="ted" /&gt;  She earned an undergraduate degree in Political Science from the [[University of Pittsburgh]] and graduated from [[Harvard Law School]] in 2005.&lt;ref name="citizen" /&gt;&lt;ref name="about"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kenyanpundit.com/about/|title=About|last=Okolloh|first=Ory|work=Kenyan Pundit|accessdate=2009-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Her father died of [[AIDS]] in 1999.&lt;ref name="ind" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ted" /&gt;  Okolloh lives in [[Nairobi]], [[Kenya]], with her husband and three children.&lt;ref name="ind" /&gt;

== Career ==
In 2006 she co-founded the parliamentary watchdog site ''[[Mzalendo]]'' (Swahili: "Patriot").&lt;ref name="mcclatchy" /&gt; The site sought to increase government accountability by systematically recording bills, speeches, MPs, standing orders, etc.&lt;ref name="mcclatchy"&gt;{{cite news | first=Shashank | last=Bengali | title=Native voices blog out of Africa | date=2007-06-21 |  url =http://www.mcclatchydc.com/homepage/v-print/story/17159.html | work =[[McClatchy Newspapers]] | accessdate = 2009-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Andrew | last=Heavens | title=The web watchdog biting Kenya's MPs | date=2007-03-14 |  url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6412143.stm | work =[[BBC News]] | accessdate = 2009-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Kenya was engulfed in violence following a [[2007–2008 Kenyan crisis|disputed presidential election]] in 2007, Okolloh helped create ''[[Ushahidi]]'' (Swahili: "Witness"), a website that collected and recorded eyewitness reports of violence using text messages and [[Google Maps]].&lt;ref name="citizen"&gt;{{cite news | first=Megha | last=Bahree | title=Citizen Voices | date=2008-11-13 |  url =https://www.forbes.com/forbes/2008/1208/083.html | work =[[Forbes]] | accessdate = 2009-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The technology has since been adapted for other purposes (including monitoring elections and tracking pharmaceutical availability) and used in a number of other countries.

Okolloh has a personal blog, ''Kenyan Pundit'', which was featured on [[Global Voices Online]].&lt;ref name="voices"&gt;{{cite news | first=Clark | last=Boyd | title=Global voices speak through blogs | date=2005-04-06 |  url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/4414247.stm | work =BBC News | accessdate = 2009-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''paper machine''' (or '''paper-making machine''') is an industrial machine used in the [[pulp and paper industry]]
to create [[paper]] in large quantities at high speed. Modern paper-making machines are based on the principles of the Fourdrinier Machine, which uses a moving woven [[mesh]] to create a continuous paper web by filtering out the fibres held in a paper stock and producing a continuously moving wet mat of fibre. This is dried in the machine to produce a strong paper web. 

The basic process is an industrialised version of the historical process of hand paper-making, which could not satisfy the demands of developing modern society for large quantities of a printing and writing substrate. The first modern paper machine was invented in Britain by [[Henry Fourdrinier|Henry and Sealy Fourdrinier]], and patented in 1806.

The same process is used to produce [[paperboard]] on a paperboard machine.

==The process sections==

Paper machines usually have at least five distinct operational sections:

* [[#Forming section or wet end|Forming section]], commonly called the wet end, is a continuous rotating wire mesh which removes water from the paper by sucking it out of suspension.
* [[#Press section|Press section]] where the wet fibre web passes between large rolls loaded under high pressure to squeeze out as much water as possible.
* [[#Drying section|Drying section]], where the pressed sheet passes partly around, in a serpentine manner, a series of steam heated drying cylinders.  Drying removes the water content down to a level of about 6%, where it will remain at typical indoor atmospheric conditions. Infra-red driers are also used to supplement cylinder drying where required.
* [[#Calender section|Calender section]] where the dried paper is smoothened under high loading and pressure.  Only one ''nip'' (where the sheet is pressed between two rolls) is necessary in order to hold the sheet, which shrinks through the drying section and is held in tension between the press section (or breaker stack if used) and the calender.  Extra nips give more smoothing but at some expense to paper strength.
* [[#Reel section|Reel section]] where paper coming out of the machine is wound onto individual spools for further processing. 
There can also be a coating section to modify the surface characteristics with coatings such as china clay.

== History ==
Before the invention of [[continuous production|continuous]] paper making, paper was made in individual sheets by stirring a container of pulp slurry and either pouring it into a fabric sieve called a sheet mould or dipping and lifting the sheet mould from the vat. While still on the fabric in the sheet mould, the wet paper is pressed to remove excess water and then the sheet is lifted off to be hung over a rope or wooden rod to air dry.

=== Fourdrinier machine ===
In 1799, [[Louis-Nicolas Robert]] of [[Essonnes]], France, was granted a [[patent]] for a continuous paper making machine.&lt;ref name="Larousse" /&gt; At the time Robert was working for [[Didot family#Saint-Léger Didot|Saint-Léger Didot]], with whom he quarreled over the ownership of the invention. Didot thought that England was a better place to develop the machine. But during the troubled times of the [[French Revolution]], he could not go there himself, so he sent his brother-in-law, John Gamble, an Englishman living in Paris. Through a chain of acquaintances, Gamble was introduced to the brothers [[Sealy Fourdrinier|Sealy]] and [[Henry Fourdrinier]], [[stationers]] of London, who agreed to finance the project. Gamble was granted British patent 2487 on 20 October 1801. The Fourdrinier machine used a specially woven fabric [[mesh]] [[conveyor belt]] (known as a ''wire,'' as it was once woven from bronze) in the forming section, where a slurry of fibre (usually wood or other vegetable fibres) is drained to create a continuous paper web. The original Fourdrinier forming section used a horizontal drainage area, referred to as the ''drainage table''.

With the help particularly of [[Bryan Donkin]], a skilled and ingenious mechanic, an improved version of the Robert original was installed at [[Frogmore Paper Mill]], [[Apsley, Hertfordshire]], in 1803, followed by another in 1804. A third machine was installed at the Fourdriniers' own mill at Two Waters. The Fourdriniers also bought a mill at [[St Neots]] intending to install two machines there and the process and machines continued to develop.

Thomas Gilpin is most often credited for creating the first U.S cylinder type [[papermaking]] machine at [[Brandywine Creek (Christina River)|Brandywine Creek]], [[Delaware]] in 1817. This machine was also developed in England, but it was a cylinder mould machine. The Fourdrinier machine wasn't introduced into the USA until 1827.&lt;ref&gt;Hills, Richard, "Papermaking in Britain 1488–1988", Athlone Press, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Similar designs ===
Records show Charles Kinsey of [[Paterson, NJ]] had already patented a continuous process papermaking machine in 1807.  Kinsey’s machine was built locally by Daniel Sawn and by 1809 the Kinsey machine was successfully making paper at the Essex Mill in Paterson.  Financial stress and potential opportunities created by the [[Embargo of 1807]] eventually persuaded Kinsey and his backers to change the mill’s focus from paper to cotton and Kinsey's early papermaking successes were soon overlooked and forgotten.&lt;ref name="Bidwell"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bidwell|first1=John|title=American Paper Mills, 1690–1832: A Directory of the Paper Trade with Notes...|date=2013|publisher=Dartmouth College Press|isbn=978-1-58465-964-8|pages=154–155|url=http://www.upne.com/1584659648.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HAER NJ-6"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Historic American Engineering Record Essex Mill NJ-6|journal=National American Engineering Record|page=3|url=http://cdn.loc.gov/master/pnp/habshaer/nj/nj0100/nj0180/data/nj0180data.pdf|publisher=National Park Service Department of the Interior Washington D.C. 20240|quote=The Essex Mill is historic as the first new mill site leased by the Society for Establishing Useful Manufacturers, and as the scene of some of the earliest experiments with continuous paper manufacture in the United States.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gilpin's 1817 patent was similar to Kinsey's, as was the John Ames patent of 1822.  The Ames patent was challenged by his competitors, asserting that Kinsey was the original inventor and Ames had been pilfering other peoples' ideas, their evidence being the employment of Daniel Sawn to work on his machine.&lt;ref name=Bidwell /&gt;

== Pulp types and their preparations ==
{{Main|Pulp (paper)}}
The plant fibres used for pulp are composed mostly of cellulose and hemi-cellulose, which have a tendency to form molecular linkages between fibres in the presence of water.  After the water evaporates the fibres remain bonded.  It is not necessary to add additional binders for most paper grades, although both wet and dry strength additives may be added.

Rags of [[cotton]] and [[linen]] were the major source of pulp for paper before wood pulp.  Today almost all pulp is of wood fibre.  Cotton fibre is used in speciality grades, usually in printing paper for such things as resumes and currency.

Sources of rags often appear as waste from other manufacturing such as denim fragments or glove cuts.  Fibres from clothing come from the cotton boll.  The fibres can range from 3 to 7&amp;nbsp;cm in length as they exist in the cotton field.  Bleach and other chemicals remove the colour from the fabric in a process of cooking, usually with steam.  The cloth fragments mechanically abrade into fibres, and the fibres get shortened to a length appropriate for manufacturing paper with a cutting process.  Rags and water dump into a trough forming a closed loop.  A cylinder with cutting edges, or knives, and a knife bed is part of the loop. The spinning cylinder pushes the contents of the trough around repeatedly.  As it lowers slowly over a period of hours, it breaks the rags up into fibres, and cuts the fibres to the desired length.  The cutting process terminates when the mix has passed the cylinder enough times at the programmed final clearance of the knives and bed.

Another source of cotton fibre comes from the [[cotton ginning]] process.  The seeds remain, surrounded by short fibres known as [[linter]]s for their short length and resemblance to lint.  Linters are too short for successful use in fabric.  Linters removed from the cotton seeds are available as first and second cuts.  The first cuts are longer.

The two major classifications of pulp are [[chemical pulp|chemical]] and [[mechanical pulp|mechanical]].  Chemical pulps formerly used a [[sulfite process|sulphite process]], but the [[kraft process]] is now predominant.  Kraft pulp has superior strength to sulphite and mechanical pulps and kraft process spent pulping chemicals are easier to recover and regenerate. Both chemical pulps and mechanical pulps may be bleached to a high brightness.

Chemical pulping dissolves the [[lignin]] that bonds fibres to one another, and binds the outer [[fibril]]s that compose individual fibres to the fibre core.  Lignin, like most other substances that can separate fibres from one another, acts as a debonding agent, lowering strength.  Strength also depends on maintaining long cellulose molecule chains.  The kraft process, due to the alkali and sulphur compounds used, tends to minimize attack on the cellulose and the non-crystalline [[hemicellulose]], which promotes bonding, while dissolving the lignin. Acidic pulping processes shorten the cellulose chains.

Kraft pulp makes superior [[linerboard]] and excellent printing and writing papers.

Groundwood, the main ingredient used in [[newsprint]] and a principal component of magazine papers (coated publications), is literally ground wood produced by a grinder.  Therefore, it contains a lot of lignin, which lowers its strength.  The grinding produces very short fibres that drain slowly.

Thermomechanical pulp (TMP) is a variation of groundwood where fibres are separated mechanically while at high enough temperatures to soften the lignin.

Between chemical and mechanical pulps there are semi-chemical pulps that use a mild chemical treatment followed by refining.  Semi-chemical pulp is often used for corrugating medium.

Bales of [[recycled paper]] (normally old corrugated containers) for unbleached (brown) packaging grades may be simply pulped, screened and cleaned.  Recycling to make white papers is usually done in a deinking plant, which employs screening, cleaning, washing, bleaching and flotation. [[Deinked pulp]] is used in printing and writing papers and in [[tissue paper|tissue]], napkins and [[paper towel]]s. It is often blended with virgin pulp.

At integrated pulp and paper mills, pulp is usually stored in high density towers before being pumped to stock preparation.  Non integrated mills use either dry pulp or wet lap (pressed) pulp, usually received in bales.  The pulp bales are slushed in a [re]pulper.

== Stock (pulp) preparation ==

Stock preparation is the area where pulp is usually refined, blended to the appropriate proportion of [[hardwood]], [[softwood]] or recycled fibre, and diluted to as uniform and constant as possible consistency. The [[pH]] is controlled and various fillers, such as whitening agents, [[sizing|size]] and [[wet strength]] or dry strength are added if necessary.  Additional [[filler (materials)|fillers]] such as [[clay]], [[calcium carbonate]] and [[titanium dioxide]] increase [[opacity (optics)|opacity]] so printing on reverse side of a sheet will not distract from content on the obverse side of the sheet.  Fillers also improve printing quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Pulp is pumped through a sequence of tanks that are commonly called ''chests'', which may be either round or more commonly rectangular.  Historically these were made of special ceramic tile faced reinforced concrete, but mild and stainless steels are also used.  Low consistency pulp slurries are kept agitated in these chests by propeller like agitators near the pump suction at the chest bottom.

In the following process, different types of pulp, if used, are normally treated in separate but similar process lines until combined at a blend chest:

From high density storage or from slusher/pulper the pulp is pumped to a low density storage chest (tank).  From there it is typically diluted to about 4% consistency before being pumped to an unrefined stock chest.  From the unrefined stock chest stock is again pumped, with consistency control, through a refiner.  Refining is an operation whereby the pulp [[slurry]] passes between a pair of discs, one of which is stationary and the other rotating at speeds of typically 1,000 or 1,200 RPM for 50 and 60&amp;nbsp;Hz AC, respectively.  The discs have raised bars on their faces and pass each other with narrow clearance.  This action unravels the outer layer of the fibres, causing the [[fibril]]s of the fibres to partially detach and bloom outward, increasing the surface area to promoting bonding. Refining thus increases tensile strength.  For example, tissue paper is relatively unrefined whereas packaging paper is more highly refined. Refined stock from the refiner then goes to a refined stock chest, or blend chest, if used as such.

Hardwood fibres are typically 1&amp;nbsp;mm long and smaller in diameter than the 4&amp;nbsp;mm length typical of softwood fibres. Refining can cause the softwood fibre tube to collapse resulting in undesirable properties in the sheet.

From the refined stock, or blend chest, stock is again consistency controlled as it is being pumped to a machine chest. It may be refined or additives may be added en route to the machine chest.

The machine chest is basically a consistency levelling chest having about 15 minutes retention. This is enough retention time to allow any variations in consistency entering the chest to be levelled out by the action of the basis weight valve receiving feedback from the on line basis weight measuring scanner. (Note: Many paper machines mistakenly control consistency coming out of the machine chest, interfering with basis weight control.)&lt;ref&gt;Results from dynamic material balance sensitivity analysis: The timing for the basis weight control loop is much slower than that of a consistency loop.  Also, varying pressure of the consistency control dilution water will introduce swings in consistency.  This can be and should be verified for any particular system using dynamic material balance software such as CADSIM Plus. Run model by creating a sharp consistency change ~ 1/2% and observe system stability. [http://www.aurelsystems.com/csplus.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Operation ==
There are four main sections on this paper machine. The forming section makes the pulp into the basis of for sheets along the wire. The press section, which removes much of the remaining water via a system of nips formed by rolls pressing against each other aided by press [[felt]]s that support the sheet and absorb the pressed water. The dryer section of the paper machine, as its name suggests, dries the paper by way of a series of internally [[steam]]-heated cylinders that evaporate the moisture. Calenders are used to make the paper surface extra smooth and glossy. In practice calender rolls are normally placed vertically in a ''stack''.

=== Forming section or wet end ===
[[File:Florida Pulp and Paper Company mill, Cantonment, Florida.jpg|thumb|right|300px| A worker inspecting wet, bleached wood pulp on an old-fashioned Hollander pulper or "beater".]]

From the machine chest stock is pumped to a head tank, commonly called a "head tank" or ''stuff box'', whose purpose is to maintain a constant head (pressure) on the fiber slurry or ''stock'' as it feeds the basis weight valve.  The stuff box also provides a means allowing air bubbles to escape. The consistency of the pulp slurry at the stuff box is in the 3% range.  Flow from the stuff box is by gravity and is controlled by the basis weight valve on its way to the fan pump suction where it injected into main flow of water to the fan pump.  The main flow of water pumped by the fan pump is from a whitewater chest or tank that collects all the water drained from the forming section of the paper machine. Before the fiber stream from the stuff box is introduced, the whitewater is very low in fiber content.  The whitewater is constantly recirculated by the fan pump through the headbox and recollected from the wire pit and various other tanks and chests that receive drainage from the forming wire and vacuum assisted drainage from suction boxes and wet fiber web handling rolls.  On the way to the head box the pulp slurry may pass through centrifugal cleaners, which remove heavy contaminants like sand, and screens, which break up fibre clumps and remove over-sized debris. The fan pump ultimately feeds the headbox, whether or not any centrifugal cleaners or screens are present.&lt;ref name="TAPPI_Machine_ops"&gt;{{cite book

The purpose of the headbox is create turbulence to keep the fibers from clumping together and to uniformly distribute the slurry across the width of the wire. Wood fibers have a tendency to attract one another, forming clumps, the effect being called flocculation.  Flocculation is lessened by lowering consistency and or by agitating the slurry; however, de-flocculation becomes very difficult at much above 0.5% consistency.  Minimizing the degree of flocculation when forming is important to physical [[properties of paper]].&lt;ref name="TAPPI_Wet_End"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TAPPI  Wet End Ops"/&gt;

The consistency in the headbox is typically under 0.4% for most paper grades, with longer fibres requiring lower consistency than short fibres.  Higher consistency causes more fibres to be oriented in the '''z''' direction, while lower consistency promotes fibre orientation in the '''x-y''' direction. Higher consistency promotes higher calliper (thickness) and stiffness, lower consistency promotes higher tensile and some other strength properties and also improves formation (uniformity).&lt;ref name="TAPPI_Wet_End"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TAPPI  Wet End Ops"/&gt;  Many sheet properties continue to improve down to below 0.1% consistency; however, this is an impractical amount of water to handle. (Most paper machine run a higher headbox consistency than optimum because they have been sped up over time without replacing the fan pump and headbox. There is also an economic trade off with high pumping costs for lower consistency).

The stock slurry, often called ''white water'' at this point, exits the head box through a rectangular opening of adjustable height called the ''slice'', the white water stream being called the ''jet'' and it is pressurized on high speed machines so as to land gently on the moving fabric loop or ''wire'' at a speed typically between plus or minus 3% of the wire speed, called ''rush'' and ''drag'' respectively.  Excessive ''rush'' or ''drag'' causes more orientation of fibres in the machine direction and gives differing physical properties in machine and cross directions; however, this phenomenon is not completely avoidable on Fourdrinier machines.&lt;ref name="TAPPI_Wet_End"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TAPPI  Wet End Ops"/&gt;

On lower speed machines at 700 feet per minute, gravity and the height of the stock in the headbox creates sufficient pressure to form the jet through the opening of the slice.  The height of the stock is the head, which gives the headbox its name.  The speed of the jet compared to the speed of the wire is known as the ''jet-to-wire ratio''.  When the jet-to-wire ratio is less than unity, the fibres in the stock become drawn out in the machine direction.  On slower machines where sufficient liquid remains in the stock before draining out, the wire can be driven back and forth with a process known as ''shake''.  This provides some measure of randomizing the direction of the fibres and gives the sheet more uniform strength in both the machine and cross-machine directions.  On fast machines, the stock does not remain on the wire in liquid form long enough and the long fibres line up with the machine.  When the jet-to-wire ratio exceeds unity, the fibers tend to pile up in lumps.&lt;ref name="TAPPI_Wet_End"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TAPPI  Wet End Ops"/&gt;  The resulting variation in paper density provides the antique or parchment paper look.

Two large rolls typically form the ends of the drainage section, which is called the ''drainage table''.  The ''breast roll'' is located under the flow box, the jet being aimed to land on it at about the top centre.  At the other end of the drainage table is the suction (''couch'') roll.  The couch roll is a hollow shell, drilled with many thousands of precisely spaced holes of about 4 to 5&amp;nbsp;mm diameter.  The hollow shell roll rotates over a stationary suction box, normally placed at the top centre or rotated just down machine.  Vacuum is pulled on the suction box, which draws water from the web into the suction box.  From the suction roll the sheet feeds into the press section.&lt;ref name="TAPPI_Wet_End"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TAPPI  Wet End Ops"/&gt;

Down machine from the suction roll, and at  a lower elevation, is the ''wire turning roll''. This roll is driven and pulls the wire around the loop. The wire turning roll has a considerable angle of wrap in order to grip the wire.&lt;ref name="TAPPI_Wet_End"/&gt;

Supporting the wire in the drainage table area are a number of drainage elements.  In addition to supporting the wire and promoting drainage, the elements de-flocculate the sheet.  On low speed machines these table elements are primarily ''table rolls''.  As speed increases the suction developed in the nip of a table roll increases and at high enough speed the wire snaps back after leaving the vacuum area and causes stock to jump off the wire, disrupting the formation.  To prevent this drainage foils are used.  The foils are typically sloped between zero and two or three degrees and give a more gentle action.  Where rolls and foils are used, rolls are used near the headbox and foils further down machine.&lt;ref name="TAPPI_Wet_End"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TAPPI  Wet End Ops"/&gt;

Approaching the dry line on the table are located low vacuum boxes that are drained by a barometric leg under gravity pressure. After the dry line are the suction boxes with applied vacuum.  Suction boxes extend up to the couch roll.  At the couch the sheet consistency should be about 25%.&lt;ref name="TAPPI_Wet_End"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TAPPI  Wet End Ops"/&gt;

=== Variations of the Fourdrinier forming section ===
The forming section type is usually based on the grade of paper or paperboard being produced; however, many older machines use a less than optimum design.  Older machines can be upgraded to include more appropriate forming sections.

A '''second headbox''' may be added to a conventional fourdrinier to put a different fibre blend on top of a base layer.  A ''secondary headbox'' is normally located at a point where the base sheet is completely drained.  This is not considered a separate ply because the water action does a good job of intermixing the fibers of the top and bottom layer.  Secondary headboxes are common on [[linerboard]].

A modification to the basic fourdrinier table by adding a second wire on top of the drainage table is known as a '''top wire former'''.  The bottom and top wires converge and some drainage is up through the top wire.  A top wire improves formation and also gives more drainage, which is useful for machines that have been sped up.

The '''Twin Wire Machine''' or '''Gap former''' uses two vertical wires in the forming section, thereby increasing the de-watering rate of the fibre slurry while also giving uniform two sidedness.&lt;ref&gt;Technology choice in a global industry : the case of the twin-wire in Canada, Ofori-Amoah, Benjamin, 1989
Thesis (Ph.D.) – Simon Fraser University, 1990, http://ir.lib.sfu.ca/handle/1892/6373&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also machines with entire Fourdrinier sections mounted above a traditional Fourdrinier. This allows making multi-layer paper with special characteristics.  These are called '''top Fourdriniers''' and they make multi-ply paper or [[paperboard]]. Commonly this is used for making a top layer of bleached fibre to go over an unbleached layer.

Another type forming section is the '''cylinder mould machine'''&lt;ref&gt;''Paper Machine Clothing: Key to the Paper Making Process'' Sabit Adanur, Asten, CRC Press, 1997, p. 120–136, {{ISBN|978-1-56676-544-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; using a mesh-covered rotating cylinder partially immersed  in a tank of fibre slurry in the wet end to form a paper web, giving a more random distribution of the [[cellulose]] fibres. Cylinder machines can form a sheet at higher consistency, which gives a more three dimensional fibre orientation than lower consistencies, resulting in higher calliper (thickness) and more stiffness in the machine direction (MD).  High MD stiffness is useful in food packaging like cereal boxes and other boxes like dry laundry detergent.

'''Tissue machines''' typically form the paper web between a wire and a special fabric (felt) as they wrap around a forming roll.  The web is pressed from the felt directly onto a large diameter dryer called a ''yankee''.  The paper sticks to the yankee dryer and is peeled off with a scraping blade called a ''doctor''.  [[Tissue paper|Tissue]] machines operate at speeds of up to 2000&amp;nbsp;m/min.

=== Press section ===
[[File:Paper machine.ogv|thumb|Paper machine]]
[[File:Granite Press Roll.JPG|thumb|Granite press roll at a granite quarry site]]

The second section of the paper machine is the press section, which removes much of the remaining water via a system of nips formed by rolls pressing against each other aided by press [[felt]]s that support the sheet and absorb the pressed water.  The paper web consistency leaving the press section can be above 40%.&lt;ref name="Technical Association for the Pulp and Paper Industry"&gt;{{cite book

Pressing is the most efficient method of de-watering the sheet as only mechanical action is required. Press felts historically were made from wool. However, today they are nearly 100% synthetic. They are made up of a [[polyamide]] woven fabric with thick batt applied in a specific design to maximise water absorption.

Presses can be single or double felted. A single felted press has a felt on one side and a smooth roll on the other. A double felted press has both sides of the sheet in contact with a press felt. Single felted nips are useful when mated against a smooth roll (usually in the top position), which adds a two-sidedness—making the top side appear smoother than the bottom. Double felted nips impart roughness on both sides of the sheet.  Double felted presses are desirable for the first press section of heavy paperboard.

Simple press rolls can be rolls with grooved or [[Blind hole|blind drilled]] surface. More advanced press rolls are suction rolls. These are rolls with perforated shell and cover. The shell made of metal material such as bronze stainless steel is covered with rubber or a synthetic material. Both shell and cover are drilled throughout the surface. A stationary suction box is fitted in the core of the suction roll to support the shell being pressed. [[End face mechanical seal]]s are used for the interface between the inside surface of the shell and the suction box. For the smooth rolls, they are typically made of granite rolls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Papermaking: Papermachine – Pressing|pages=2, 3, 12, 13|url=http://www.fibrelab.ubc.ca/files/2013/01/Topic-14-Papermaking-Pressing-text.pdf|accessdate=25 August 2014|publisher=UBC Fibre Lab}}&lt;/ref&gt; The granite rolls can be up to {{Convert|30|ft|adj=on}} long and {{Convert|6|ft}} in diameter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Richter|first1=Dorothy A.|title=Barre granite quarries, Barre, Vermont|journal=Geological Society of America Centennial Field Guide—Northeastern Section|date=1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conventional roll presses are configured with one of the press rolls is in a fixed position, with a mating roll being loaded against this fixed roll. The felts run through the nips of the press rolls and continues around a felt run, normally consisting of several felt rolls. During the dwell time in the nip, the moisture from the sheet is transferred to the press felt. When the press felt exits the nip and continues around, a vacuum box known as an Uhle Box applies vacuum (normally -60 kPa) to the press felt to remove the moisture so that when the felt returns to the nip on the next cycle, it does not add moisture to the sheet.

Some grades of paper use suction pick up rolls that use vacuum to transfer the sheet from the couch to a lead in felt on the first press or between press sections.  Pickup roll presses normally have a vacuum box that has two vacuum zones (low vacuum and high vacuum). These rolls have a large number of drilled holes in the cover to allow the vacuum to pass from the stationary vacuum box through the rotating roll covering. The low vacuum zone picks up the sheet and transfers, while the high vacuum zone attempts to remove moisture. Unfortunately, at high enough speed [[centrifugal force]] flings out vacuumed water, making this less effective for dewatering. Pickup presses also have standard felt runs with Uhle boxes. However, pickup press design is quite different, as air movement is important for the pickup and dewatering facets of its role.

Crown Controlled Rolls (also known as CC Rolls) are usually the mating roll in a press arrangement. They have [[hydraulics|hydraulic]] cylinders in the press rolls that ensure that the roll does not bow. The cylinders connect to a shoe or multiple shoes to keep the crown on the roll flat, to counteract the natural "bend" in the roll shape due to applying load to the edges.

Extended Nip Presses (or ENP) are a relatively modern alternative to conventional roll presses. The top roll is usually a standard roll, while the bottom roll is actually a large CC roll with an extended shoe curved to the shape of the top roll, surrounded by a rotating rubber belt rather than a standard roll cover. The goal of the ENP is to extend the dwell time of the sheet between the two rolls thereby maximising the de-watering. Compared to  a standard roll press that achieves up to 35% solids after pressing, an ENP brings this up to 45% and higher—delivering significant steam savings or speed increases.  ENPs densify the sheet, thus increasing tensile strength and some other physical properties.

=== Dryer section ===

[[File:Papermaking machine at a paper mill near Pensacola.jpg|thumb|right|300px| Dryer section of an older Fourdrinier-style paper-making machine. These narrow, small diameter dryers are not enclosed by a hood, dating the photo to before the 1970s.]]
The dryer section of the paper machine, as its name suggests, dries the paper by way of a series of internally [[steam]]-heated cylinders that evaporate the moisture. Steam pressures may range up to 160 psig. Steam enters the end of the dryer head (cylinder cap) through a steam joint and condensate exits through a siphon that goes from the internal shell to a centre pipe.  From the centre pipe the condensate exits through a joint on the dryer head.  Wide machines require multiple siphons.  In faster machines, centrifugal force holds the condensate layer still against the shell and turbulence generating bars are typically used to agitate the condensate layer and improve heat transfer.&lt;ref name="Technical Association for the Pulp and Paper Industry" /&gt;

The sheet is usually held against the dryers by long felt loops on the top and bottom of each dryer section.  The felts greatly improve heat transfer.  Dryer felts are made of coarse thread and have a very open weave that is almost see through,  It is common to have the first bottom dryer section unfelted to dump broke on the basement floor during sheet breaks or when threading the sheet.

Paper dryers are typically arranged in groups called ''sections''  so that they can be run at a progressively slightly slower speed to compensate for sheet shrinkage as the paper dries. Some grades of paper may also stretch as they run through the machine, requiring increasing speed between sections.  The gaps between sections are called ''draws''.

The drying sections are usually enclosed to conserve heat.  Heated air is usually supplied to the pockets where the sheet breaks contact with the driers.  This increases the rate of drying. The pocket ventilating tubes have slots along their entire length that face into the pocket.  The dryer hoods are usually exhausted with a series of roof mounted hood exhausts fans down the dryer section.

=== Sizer ===
Additional [[sizing]] agents, including [[resin]]s, [[glue]], or [[starch]], can be added to the web to alter its characteristics. [[Sizing]] improves the paper's water resistance, decreases its ability to fuzz, reduces abrasiveness, and improves its printing properties and surface bond strength.  These may be applied at the wet (internal sizing) or on the dry end (surface sizing), or both. At the dry end sizing is usually applied with a ''size press''. The size press may be a roll applicator (flooded nip) or Nozzle applicator .   It is usually placed before the last dryer section.  Some paper machines also make use of a 'coater' to apply a [[coated paper|coating]] of [[fillers]] such as [[calcium carbonate]] or [[china clay]] usually suspended in a binder of cooked starch and [[styrene-butadiene]] latex.  Coating produces a very smooth, bright surface with the highest printing qualities.

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-W1015-015, Technitz, Schreibpapier AROS aus Altrohstoffen.jpg|thumb|right|300px| Paper leaving the machine is rolled onto a ''reel'' for further processing.]]

=== Calender section ===
{{Main|Calender}}
&lt;!-- Note: This is the correct spelling of 'calender' as used in this sense. --&gt;
A [[calender]] consists of two or more rolls, where pressure is applied to the passing paper. Calenders are used to make the paper surface extra smooth and glossy. It also gives it a more uniform thickness. The pressure applied to the web by the rollers determines the finish of the paper.

=== Reel section ===

After calendering, the web has a moisture content of about 6% (depending on the furnish). The paper is wound onto metal spools using a large cylinder called a ''reel drum''. Constant nip pressure is maintained between the reel drum and the spool, allowing the resulting friction to spin the spool. Paper runs over the top of the reel drum and is wound onto the spool to create a ''master roll''.

To be able to keep the paper machine running continuously, the reel must be able to quickly switch from winding a finished roll to an empty spool without stopping the flow of paper. To accomplish this, each reel section will have two or more spools rotating through the process. Using an overhead crane, empty spools will be loaded onto two ''primary arms'' above the reel drum. When the master roll reaches its maximum diameter, the arms will lower the new spool into contact with the reel drum and a machine behind the drum will run a tape along the moving sheet of paper, swiftly tearing it and attaching incoming paper onto the new spool. The spool is then lowered onto the ''secondary arms'', which steadily guide the spool away from the reel drum as the diameter of paper on the spool increases.
 
The [[Roll hardness tester|roll hardness]] should be checked, obtained and adjusted accordingly to insure that the roll hardness is within the acceptable range for the product.


===Winder section===
Reels of paper wound up at the end of the drying process are the full trimmed width, minus shrinkage from drying, of the web leaving the wire.  In the winder section reels of paper are slit into smaller rolls of a width and roll diameter range specified by a customer order. To accomplish this the reel is placed on an unwind stand and the distances between the slitters (sharp cutting wheels), are adjusted to the specified widths for the orders.  The wider is run until the desired roll diameter is reached and the rolls are labeled according to size and order before being sent to shipping or the warehouse.  A reel usually has sufficient diameter to make two or more sets of rolls.

== Glossary ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2018}}

'''broke''': waste paper, either made during a sheet break or trimmings.  It is gathered up and put in a repulper for recycling back into the process.

'''consistency''': the percent dry fibre in a pulp slurry.

'''couch''': French meaning ''to lie down''.  Following the couch roll the sheet is lifted off the wire and transferred into the press section.

'''dandy roll''': a mesh covered hollow roll that rides on top of the Fourdrinier. It breaks up fibre clumps to improve the sheet formation and can also be used to make an imprint, as with [[laid paper]]. See also [[watermark]].

'''fan pump''': the large pump that circulates white water from the white water chest to the headbox.  The pump is a special low pulse design that minimizes the effect of vane pulses which would cause uneven basis weight of paper in the machine direction known as ''barring''. The flow from the fan pump may go through screens and cleaners, if used.  On large paper machines fan pumps may be rated in tens of thousands of gallons per minute.

'''felt''': a loop of fabric or synthetic material that goes between press rolls and serves as a place to receive the pressed out water.  Felts also support the wet paper web and guide it through the press section. Felts are also used in the dryer section to keep the sheet in close contact with the dryers and increase heat transfer.

'''[[filler (materials)|filler]]''': a finely divided substance added to paper in the forming process.  Fillers improve print quality, brightness and opacity.  The most common fillers are clay and calcium carbonate. Titanium dioxide is a filler but also improves brightness and opacity.  Use of calcium carbonate filler is the process called ''alkaline sizing'' and uses different chemistry than acid sizing.  Alkaline sized paper has superior ageing properties.

'''formation''': the degree of uniformity of fiber distribution in finished paper, which is easily seen by holding paper up to the light.

'''[[headbox]]''': the pressure chamber where turbulence is applied to break up fibre clumps in the slurry.  The main job of the headbox is to distribute the fiber slurry uniformly across the wire.

'''nip''': the contact area where two opposing rolls meet, such as in a press or calender.

'''[[pH]]''': the degree of acidity or alkalinity of a solution. Alkaline paper has a very long life.  Acid paper deteriorates over time, which caused libraries to either take conservation measures or replace many older books.

'''[[sizing|size]]''': a chemical (formerly rosin derived but now a different chemical) or starch, applied to paper to retard the rate of water penetration.  Sizing prevents ''bleeding'' of ink during printing, improving the sharpness of printing.

'''slice''': the adjustable rectangular orifice, usually at the bottom of the headbox, through which the whitewater jet discharges onto the wire.  The slice opening and water pressure together determine the amount and velocity of whitewater flow through the slice.  The slice usually has some form of adjustment mechanism to even out the paper weight profile across the machine (CD profile), although a newer methods is to inject water into the whitewater across the headbox slice area, thereby using localized consistency to control CD weight profile.

'''stock''': a pulp slurry that has been processed in the stock preparation area with necessary additives, refining and pH adjustment and ready for making paper

'''web''': the continuous flow of un-dried fibre from the couch roll down the paper machine

'''white water''': filtrate from the drainage table.  The white water from the table is usually stored in a white water chest from which it is pumped by the fan pump to the headbox.

'''wire''': the woven mesh fabric loop that is used for draining the pulp slurry from the headbox. Until the 1970s bronze wires were used but now they are woven from coarse mono-filament synthetics similar to fishing line but very stiff.

==Materials ==

Stainless steels are used extensively in the [[Pulp and paper industry|Pulp and Paper]] industry&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nickelinstitute.org/TechnicalLibrary/Reference%20Book%20Series/11025_StainlessSteelsandSpecialtyAlloysforModernPulpandPaperMills.aspx|title=Stainless Steels and Specialty Alloys for Modern Pulp and Paper Mills|last=A. H. Tuthill|first=|date=2002|website=Nickel Institute|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; for two primary reasons, to avoid iron contamination of the product and their corrosion resistance to the various chemicals used in the paper making process. Type 316 stainless steel is a common material used in paper machines.

'''Pearl River Tower''' ({{zh|s=珠江城大厦|hp=Zhūjiāng chéng dàshà}}; or {{zh|s=珠江大厦|hp=Zhūjiāng dàshà|links=no}}) is a 71-[[storey|story]], {{convert|309.6|m|abbr=on}},&lt;ref name="som" /&gt; [[clean technology]] [[neofuturistic]] [[skyscraper]] at the junction of Jinsui Road/Zhujiang Avenue West, [[Tianhe District]], [[Guangzhou]], [[China]]. The tower's architecture and engineering were performed by [[Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill]] with [[Adrian D. Smith]] and Gordon Gill (now at their own firm, [[Adrian Smith + Gordon Gill Architecture|AS+GG]]) as architects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Smith | first = Adrian | title = The Architecture of Adrian Smith, SOM: Toward a Sustainable Future | publisher = Images Publishing Group Pty Ltd | year = 2007 | isbn = 1-86470-169-2 | page = 556 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ground broke on the tower on 8 September 2006 and construction was completed in March 2011. It is intended for office use and is partially occupied by the [[China National Tobacco Co.|China National Tobacco Corporation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author= | title=The winds of change  | url=http://www.worldarchitecturenews.com/index.php?fuseaction=wanappln.projectview&amp;upload_id=475 | work=World Architecture News | date=22 August 2006 | accessdate=23 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architecture and design==
The design of the Pearl River Tower is intended to minimise harm to the environment and it will extract energy from the natural and passive forces surrounding the building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.som.com/content.cfm/net_zero_energy_design |title=Net Zero Energy Design |publisher=SOM |accessdate=11 April 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090401224816/http://som.com/content.cfm/net_zero_energy_design |archivedate=1 April 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Major accomplishments are the technological integration of form and function in a holistic approach to engineering and architectural design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Kyra Epstein | title=How Far Can You Go? Case Study: Pearl River Tower | url=http://www.nxtbook.com/nxtbooks/ashrae/hpb_2008winter/index.php?startid=23 | publisher=High Performing Buildings Magazine | date=Winter 2008 | accessdate=2 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sustainability===
The building is designed with [[energy conservation]] in mind, including [[wind turbine]]s and [[Solar thermal collector|solar collector]]s, [[photovoltaics|photovoltaic cells]], [[underfloor air distribution]], and [[Radiant heating and cooling system|radiant heating and cooling]] ceilings. It is one of the most [[environmentally friendly]] buildings in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{glasssteelandstone|955}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of Pearl River Tower’s accomplishments, many are related to the sustainable design features include:
* The largest radiant-cooled office building in the world
* Most energy efficient super-tall building in the world
* The tower is an example of China’s goal to reduce the intensity of carbon dioxide emissions per unit of GDP in 2020 by 40 to 45 percent as compared to the level of 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2009-11/26/content_9058731.htm | work=China Daily | title=China to cut 40 to 45% GDP unit carbon by 2020| date=26 November 2009 | accessdate=23 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a report presented at the 2008 [[Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat]] it was reported that the building's sustainable design features will allow a 58% energy usage reduction when compared to similar stand alone buildings.&lt;ref name="Frechette-Gilchrist"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Frechette |first= R|authorlink= |author2=Gilchrist, R|date=March 2008|title=Towards Zero Energy: A case study of the Pearl River Tower, Guangzhou, China|trans_title= |journal= Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat|volume= |issue= |pages=pg. 9 |id= |accessdate= November 14, 2013 |url=http://ctbuh.org/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=%2bpedN46s7Es%3d&amp;tabid=486&amp;language=en-US/|publisher= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The building would have been able to be carbon neutral and actually sell power back to the surrounding neighborhood if the micro-turbines had been installed into the building.  However the local power company in Guangzhou does not allow independent energy producers to sell electricity back to the grid.  Without the financial incentive to add the micro-turbines the developers removed them from the design.  If they had been added excess power would have been produced from the building, at the very least, after office hours when the power needed by the building itself had been reduced.&lt;ref name="Frechette-Gilchrist"/&gt;

[[Image:Itera plastic bicycle.jpg|thumb|The Itera plastic bicycle.]]
A small number of '''plastic bicycle''' models have been produced. A notable example is the ''Itera'' Plastic Bicycle, a 1980s [[Sweden|Swedish]] attempt to modernize the [[bicycle]] by replacing [[metal]] with [[injection moulded]] plastic [[composite materials]]. The project ended in technical and commercial failure after three years.

== History ==
In December 1977, [[Volvo]] in [[Gothenburg]] wanted to produce minicars and investigated conditions and designs. In January 1978, it proposed plastic [[composite materials]] in many parts of the car. Other products were considered, the bicycle one of them. In October 1978, a grant of SEK 54,000 from the Swedish National Board for Technical Development financed a [[prototype]] plastic [[bicycle]].

In February 1980, a rideable bicycle was demonstrated to the state-owned bank and a loan of SEK 6 million granted.
In March 1980, ''Itera Development Center AB'' was born to design, produce, and market composite-material bicycles.

In September 1981, the first bicycles were shown to retailers and the press. Nationwide advertising was scheduled for spring 1982. The bikes were delivered unassembled with tools provided in the box. In autumn 1981, more than 100,000 Swedes indicated they were interested. In February 1982,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www3.lu.se/info/lum/LUM_06_95/LUM6_18_cykel.html Lunds universitet] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719191133/http://www3.lu.se/info/lum/LUM_06_95/LUM6_18_cykel.html |date=2011-07-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; production started in [[Vilhelmina]]. However, sales were slow and the news media lost interest. The fact that not every box contained every part to assemble a bicycle frustrated many customers.

The following year was worse. Boxes of bicycles piled up in shops. Among them were returns, mostly with broken parts. Where metal bends, plastic breaks. Getting replacements was not simple as the parts were incompatible with other bikes. 
Attempts to save the project were unsuccessful.

In 1983, 1,000 ''Itera bicycles'' were purchased for a national five-day [[orienteering]] contest. They were rented to participants who were invited to buy them after the contest. All were sold. It showed there was a market but it was too late. Campaigns such as lower prices failed.

Production ended in 1985. Approximately 30,000 Itera bicycles were produced. The stock was sold to the [[Caribbean]] region where they became popular as rust is a problem with metal bicycles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lassecollin.se/collinads/evighetsmaskinen.html Evighetsmaskinen]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other plastic bikes==
This was not, however, the first attempt at a plastic bicycle.  Popular Science featured ads in 1973 from "The Original Plastic Bike Inc", with plans to make the bicycle - including the chain and hubs, possibly excluding the spokes - entirely from injection-molded [[Lexan]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://mombat.org/MOMBAT/Museum/Plastic_Bike_History.html Original Plastic Bike] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150528055428/http://mombat.org/MOMBAT/Museum/Plastic_Bike_History.html |date=2015-05-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=4bSABo8Akh4C&amp;pg=PA105&amp;lpg=PA105&amp;dq=Original+Plastic+Bike&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=7FrmdQRgF7&amp;sig=bsKFPbdD_pN9dOdrqXQXlaUZJKk&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=3NQRTOOdPMP6lwfZ4ICZCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CCQQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Original%20Plastic%20Bike&amp;f=false Popular Science ad]&lt;/ref&gt; The company was founded on December 15, 1971 by John P. Marzullo, Roger Stark, and William Thompson, based on ideas by  Joseph Dorrity and Charles Cadorette.  It is unknown whether the company sold a single bicycle, but some prototypes were made.  The claim was that it would weigh less than 17 pounds, but would be stronger than steel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.velo-pages.com/main.php?g2_itemId=27603 Everything You Always Wanted to Know About the Original Plastic Bike (1973)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The EADS Airbike is a [[bicycle]] constructed from [[laser]]-formed [[nylon]] powder and made by [[EADS]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-12664422 BBC: Bristol engineers invent nylon bicycle strong as steel]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nyteknik.se/nyheter/automation/cad/article3122392.ece Ny Teknik: Airbike byggs av nylonpulver]&lt;/ref&gt;

The FRII [[Injection molding]] recycled plastic bicycles is a rather new design, from 2011. It is to be made entirely from injection-molded recycled plastic. 
The chair set can be pulled out and replaced to adjust to the height of the rider.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.designboom.com/weblog/cat/8/view/15791/dror-peleg-frii-plastic-bike.html Article about FRII at DesignBoom]&lt;/ref&gt; It is to be produced by local industries for economy and ecological reasons, as its manufacture process is simple and low cost in large quantities.

'''The Polytechnic Museum''' ({{lang-ru|'''Политехнический музей'''}}) is one of the oldest [[science museum]]s in the world, located in [[Moscow]] that emphasizes the progress of [[Russia]]n and [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] technology and science, as well as modern inventions and developments. It was founded in 1872 after the first [[All-Russian Technical Exhibition]] on the bicentennial anniversary of the birth of [[Peter the Great]] at the initiative of the [[Society of Devotees of Natural Science, Anthropology, and Ethnography]].&lt;ref name=PM&gt;Polytechnic Museum, [http://eng.polymus.ru/?s=18&amp;lvl=1 History]&lt;/ref&gt; The first stage of the museum was designed by [[Ippolit Monighetti]] and completed in 1877.&lt;ref name=PM/&gt; Almost from the beginning, the collection was too big for the space. The north wing was added in 1896 and the south wing in 1907. At present the main building of the museum (Novaya sq., 3/4) is closed for reconstruction. The opening of the renovated museum in this building is scheduled for 2018. From 2013 and for the whole period of renovation the museum will work in partnership venues in Moscow.

It is the largest technical museum in Russia, offering a wide array of historical inventions and technological achievements, including humanoid automata of the 18th century and the first Soviet computers. Its collection contains more than 160,000 items in 65 halls including, [[chemistry]], [[mining]], [[metallurgy]], [[transport]], [[energy]], [[optics]], [[automation]], [[computer engineering]], [[radio electronics]], [[communications]], and [[space exploration]].

Highlights include the first [[achromatic telescope]]; an early solar microscope, created by German anatomists [[Johann Nathanael Lieberkühn]]; an early seismograph created by [[Boris Borisovich Galitzine]]; [[Electrotyping|galvanoplastics]] by [[Moritz von Jacobi]]; and early electric lights by [[Pavel Yablochkov]].&lt;ref&gt;Polytechnical museum, [http://eng.polymus.ru/?s=19&amp;lvl=1 The Museum Collections]&lt;/ref&gt; The automobile exhibit includes a [[Russo-Balt]] K12/20 and a [[GAZ-M20 Pobeda]].

== History ==
[[File:N.A.Naidenov (1884). Views of Moscow. 64. Politechnical cropped.png|thumb|The first stage of Polytechnic Museum building, photographed in 1884.]]
The [[Society of Devotees of Natural Science, Anthropology, and Ethnography|Society of Devotees of Natural Science]] was formed in Moscow in 1863. The society's first President was [[Gregory Ephimovich Shchurovsky]] and he together with other leading members of the society discussed having a museum. Their first move in this direction was to establish a library this held books documenting the history of science and technology. This became the Central Polytechnic Library but this established their ambitions. In 1871 Moscow council set aside half a million roubles to create a museum. A committee was formed with [[Grand Duke Konstantin Nikolayevich of Russia|Grand Duke Konstantin Nikolayevich]] as honorary chair. The formation of a museum was timely as [[Peter the Great]]'s 200th anniversary would inspire the [[All-Russian Technical Exhibition]] that would be used to launch the new museum.&lt;ref name=hist&gt;[http://www.prlib.ru/en-us/History/Pages/Item.aspx?itemid=1174 The Polytechnical Museum opened in Moscow], Presidential Library, Retrieved 17 November 2015&lt;/ref&gt; The exhibits at the Exhibition were dedicated to the 200th anniversary of the birth of Peter the Great.

[[File:1872 All-Russian Technical Exhibition in Moscow.jpg|thumb|left|1872 All-Russian Technical Exhibition in Moscow by [[Ivan Dyagovchenko]] ]]

*The museum building in Novaya square in Moscow is a unique architectural monument, built specially for the museum by famous Russian architects [[Ippolit Monighetti]], [[Alexander Kaminsky]], [[:de:August Weber (Architekt)|August Weber]].
*museum of Applied Knowledge is the original purpose of the museum. The first display consisted of 9 departments closely related to applied sciences (physics, chemistry, architecture and others)
*THE AMPHITEATRE (aka Big Lectures Hall) is an important Moscow public site located in the museum building. Its opening in 1907 has enabled public demonstrations of scientific experiments, as well as lectures, debates, literary evenings, conferences. [[Niels Bohr]], [[Élie Metchnikoff]], [[Kliment Timiryazev]], [[Alexander Blok]], [[Vladimir Mayakovsky]], [[Yevgeny Yevtushenko]], [[Bulat Okudzhava]] and many other prominent figures of science and culture gave their speeches and lectures.
*During the [[First World War]] the museum was used as a hospital for the wounded people. It had a radiological office that was used by all Moscow medical facilities. After 1917 it hosted political rallies and meetings with the participation of [[Vladimir Lenin]], [[Felix Dzerzhinsky]].
*In July 1919 the museum was renamed as the Central Institute of polytechnic knowledge. The main focus of its work was research, dissemination of scientific knowledge in the field of natural sciences, mathematics, technology and the economy. It was also supposed to acquaint the public with discoveries and inventions in these areas of knowledge. 
*In the 1929-1930-s the whole display of the museum was distributed between three new sectors: general, industrial and agricultural; the museum laboratories lost their scientific and research meaning and became centers for advanced training of workers.
*The key point in the history of the museum was the All-Union Exhibition "Our Achievements" in 1934 that was opened in the honor of the [[17th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)|XVII Congress of the CPSU(b)]]. The exhibition was a huge demonstration of the victories of socialist industry during Stalin's [[first five-year plan]]. After the reorganization in 1935 the exhibition "Our Achievements" became the basis of a new exhibition in the museum that underwent radical reorganization for this purpose. Permanent exhibits were split up into divisions reflecting the development of major industries in the country: energy, fuel industry, metallurgy, mechanical engineering, chemistry, agriculture, textile and light industry, etc.
*Knowledge for the people! 1947 - museum falls under the control of [[:ru:Знание (общество)|"Znanie" society]] and the mission of education and dissemination of scientific and political knowledge comes to the fore.
*Science and Technology museum. In the 1980-s the museum becomes the main museum of the Soviet Union that stores and displays in the history of Soviet science and technology. 
*Polytechnic Museum today has a unique collection of exhibits - its funds consist of more than 200,000 items. The museum has about 150 thematic collections.
*Polytechnic Museum is also the founder of the Association of scientific and technical museums in Russia, along with the [[Varshavsky railway station|Central museum of Railway Transport]] of the Russian Federation, the [[A.S. Popov Central Museum of Communications]] and "Museum world" magazine. The Polytechnic Museum is a scientific, organizational and methodological center of the Association of scientific and technical museums in Russia.
*Polytechnic Library was founded in 1862 and is a part of the Polytechnic Museum. The library keeps more than 3.5 million books in various fields of science and technology, including rare instances of bibliography dated back to 16th to 18th centuries.
*Start of modernization. In April 2010 the President of the Russian Federation [[Dmitry Medvedev]] instructed the Russian government to develop the concept of a museum of Science on the basis of the Polytechnic Museum. 
*Reconstruction of the historical building. In 2013, the historical building of the museum was closed for renovation. The display of the museum and its collections were moved to a temporary site in Moscow. In 2020 the Polytechnic Museum will be reopened for visitors in a renovated historic building.

== Collections ==
[[File:Russo-balt.JPG|thumb|right|Russo-Balt K12/20 released in 1911 in Polytechnical Museum (Moscow)]]

As of January 1, 2013 the museum fund of the museum consisted of 229,348 items. The museum features about 150 museum collections of national and world importance. The funds of the museum are dominated by scientific and technical typological collections consisting of functional technical objects. They can be used as a source of information about the main stages and directions of development of a particular type of technology.

A highlight of the museum is the collection of vehicles, including the sections Bicycles, Motorcycles, Cars. The pearl of the car collection is the world only surviving Russian car built before the Revolution [[Russo-Balt]] K12/20 released in 1911.

All technologies combined in the thematic fund "Electronics and Communication" is presented in the collections "Exchanges", "Sound recording and playback technique", "TV receivers", "Radio receivers". Museum collection "Telephones" shows the development of terminal telephone systems from Bell's receiver to modern mobile phones. The collection "Telegraph technique" includes all types of telegraph and facsimile technique since creation of the first electromagnetic machine by [[Pavel Schilling|P.L. Schilling]] in 1832 and until 1980-s.

The collection of computing equipment is the most comprehensive display in Russia and includes rare copyrights devices, such as automated [[abacus]] by [[Viktor Bunyakovsky]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://history-computer.com/CalculatingTools/Gadgets/Buniakovski.html Viktor Bunyakovsky]&lt;/ref&gt; one of the first models of [[Odhner Arithmometer|Odner's adding machine]], the only surviving copy of the domestic computer "Ural", [[Water integrator|hydraulic integrator]] by [[:ru:Лукьянов, Владимир Сергеевич (учёный)|Vladimir Lukyanov]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digitaljournal.com/article/338106 In 1936 Soviet scientist Lukyanov built an analog water computer]&lt;/ref&gt; the world's only computer based on [[ternary logic]], "Syetun" and many other rarities.

== Modernization ==
'''Start of modernization'''
In April 2010 the President of the Russian Federation Dmitry Medvedev instructed the Russian government to develop a concept of a museum of science on the basis of the Polytechnic Museum. Modernization of the museum is a large-scale state innovation project. The modernization program for 2017-2018 envisages the creation of a fundamentally new museum and educational center covering the greatest achievements of science, technology and society.
 
'''Modernization goals'''
*To create a modern functional and visitor-friendly museum space that meets the highest international requirements for museums in the 21st century, and to present a new modern display reflecting the most pressing issues of science, technology and civilization in general.
*To implement the project of successful modernization of the largest science museums and technical in the country, the results of which can further be used by other Russian museums.
 
'''Tender for concept development'''
On the basis of the decree of the Ministry of Culture of the Russian Federation the Development fund of the Polytechnic Museum held a tender for the development of the museum concept. As a result of a choice from 14 competitive bids provided by Russian and foreign companies specializing in museum design, British company Event Communications Ltd. was selected.

From October 2010 to February 2011 Event Communications with the active participation of Russian experts and staff of the museum developed the concept of the museum of science on the basis of the Polytechnic Museum. The concept was coordinated by the Board of Trustees of the museum in February 2011 and approved by decree of the Ministry of Culture of the Russian Federation.

The concept of the museum provides, in particular, for the reconstruction of its historic building, extension of educational areas and public spaces, development of educational and other communications programs for visitors of all ages.

The concept also includes updating the content and design of the permanent exhibition and its division into three sections – Matter, Energy and Information. These sections represent all major areas of science and technology, as well as interdisciplinary areas, including developing fields such as life-science.

Moreover, according to the concept, Moscow plans to create a second site - a museum and educational center of the Polytechnic Museum and Lomonosov MSU. that will be located in the campus of Moscow State University on Vorobyevy Gory.

'''Tender for the architectural concept of historical building reconstruction'''
In accordance with the order of the Ministry of Culture of the Russian Federation of 28 April 2011, a two-stage international architectural competition for the completion of an architectural project of reconstruction and restoration of the building of the Polytechnic Museum in Moscow was announced on 6 June 2011. The tender attracted a number of famous Russian and foreign architectural companies.

Finally, the concept of a Japanese architect Junia Ishigami was chosen as a winner.

The concept of a "museum - park" demonstrates a new approach to the historical building of the museum as a more open architectural object that plays an important role in the urban space.

The architectural concept by Junia Ishigami provides for extremely delicate attitude to historical restoration of the building. At the same time the architect offered the covering of museum courtyards with innovative designs constructions that shall keep the same three-dimensional structure of the building, its shape in the urban landscape and at the same time increase the area of public spaces that are required by all contemporary museums. The basement of the building will be open for the visitors, thus creating additional spatial volume that can play an important social role in the composition of the center of Moscow.
 
'''Tender for architectural concepts of the museum and educational center of the Polytechnic Museum and Lomonosov MSU.'''
The tender for architectural concepts of the museum and educational center of the Polytechnic Museum and Lomonosov MSU was announced in October 2012. Projects were evaluated based on a number of criteria such as marketability, quality planning, urban planning and conceptual solutions, as well as the planned level of spending on construction and operation. The winner of the competition was a consortium of two companies: Massimiliano Fuksas Architetto (Italy) and Speech (Russia). The winners the draft of a three-storey building on the glazed two-level basis, 9.2 m high, with the volume of the upper level making up 25 m, a terrace level that is about 6.4 m high, 2 underground levels, as well as an open-plan lounge with passages to different zones.

In the future, the museum and educational center is expected to take an important place in the life of Moscow, to become a multi-functional cultural and educational center, a platform of communication for both the scientific community and the general audience interested in modern science. The project is expected to be completed in 2017.

'''Sites of the Polytechnic Museum at the time of reconstruction'''
On 9 January 2013 permanent exhibitions of the museum were closed to visitors. During the time of reconstruction all fund, exposition and educational activities of the museum will be conducted in three major venues in Moscow.

Exposition "Russia Does It Itself" will be placed in pavilion No. 26 (former transport pavilion) of the WEC. The main idea of the exhibition is to introduce the visitors to the achievements of Russian science and technology as a significant part of the global scientific context. At the time of reconstruction of the historical building the WEC site will not only serve as a representative of the museum, but also become an active space for development and introduction of modern technologies and methods of museum communication that will later be widely used in the modernized museum.

The display in the Transport pavilion is scheduled to open in spring 2014. 
 
The funds of the museum during the period of reconstruction will be located in the former AZLK as well as the museum library.
 
Since autumn 2013 a lecture hall of the museum and a research laboratory for children has been working in the ZIL Cultural Center. 
 
'''Areas of activity'''
During the renovation of the historic building the Polytechnic Museum will operate on temporary and partner sites in Moscow and regions. The main areas of work will be exhibitions, lectures, conferences, festivals and other projects that meet the core mission of the museum - the popularization of science and enlightenment.
 
''Museum exhibition activities'' are implemented jointly with various Russian and foreign partners. For example, the Polytechnic Museum presented the international exhibition Science Tunnel of Max Planck that has been successfully displayed all over the world for 13 years. One of the most vivid and memorable interactive exhibits was Game: A Look into the Future organized by the Polytechnic Museum on the site in ZIL cultural center together with Science Gallery (Dublin, Ireland) and a team of world-famous game designers, artists, game developers and curators. Exhibition Inventing the Bicycle that took place in the WEC gained much popularity. It presented exhibits from the funds of the museum and other private and museum collections.

Polytechnic Museum has an active exhibition program in the regions on the partner sites of other museums (in Yaroslavl, Tula, Vologda, Rybinsk and other cities).
 
''Educational programs'' of the museum include a variety of areas for children and adults. ''Scientific laboratories'' of the Polytechnic Museum are fun and informative workshops that take place in the form of games. The programs have been developed by the best scientists specifically for children and the lessons are given by wonderful young teachers. During training the children not only get additional knowledge about different disciplines, but also carry out their own research, as well as create exhibits for displays. Today the museum offers laboratories in chemistry, physics, biology, mathematics, robotics, as well as a children's center of automotive design and a children's lecture hall. Moreover, in September 2013 a University of Children was opened. This is an educational project of the museum created in partnership with HSE (Higher School of Economics). University of Children is a center of additional education for pupils aged 8–11. During lectures and seminars, university students make experiments and carry out their own research with the help of scientists and experts from different fields of science. 
 
September 2013 was distinguished by the start of the ''Festival of the Science Culture Polifest'' - an outdoor science holiday that was held in the Industry square of WEC. 
 
Since 2011, the Polytechnic Museum has been organizing a ''Contemporary Science Film Festival 360°'', showing visitors from Moscow and other regions the best documentaries from around the world that received awards at major international festivals. Most of the films are Russian premieres, and the festival has always had full houses in cinemas, partner universities and other sites, wherever the screenings take place.
 
In 2013, together with the RIA Novosti news agency the museum launched a topical educational project Science Monday, aimed at the promotion of modern science. The project shows the best documentaries on scientific topics. The purpose of the project is to unite people of different generations that share the ideals of self-education and enlightenment. Also, the project aims to promote the development of science journalism. The viewers are invited to become participants in the dialogue, allies or opponents of the filmmakers.
 
In September 2013, in partnership with The World Science Festival the Polytechnic Museum in Moscow presented a contemporary reading of the legend of Icarus—a multimedia performance ''Icarus at the Edge of Time'', based on [[Icarus at the Edge of Time|the eponymous book]] by the famous scientist, theoretical physicist, professor at Columbia University, [[Brian Greene]], one of the most famous contemporary composers Philip Glass and video artists duo Al + Al. The premiere took place in Moscow in the presence of the author. 
 
In 2013, the Polytechnic Museum joined the board of the International Committee for Museums and Collections of Science and Technology ICIMUSET of International Council of Museums ICOM under the aegis of UNESCO.

== Public lectures ==
In addition to its function as a museum, the Polytechnic Museum has been an important place for dissemination of science and culture in Russian.  From 1913 to 1918 it was the centre of discussions about [[Russian avant-garde]], with public lectures given by [[Vladimir Mayakovsky]], [[David Burlyuk]], [[Andrei Bely]], [[Alexei Kruchenykh]], [[Velimir Khlebnikov]].&lt;ref&gt;Vladimir Markov, Russian Futurism: A History, University of California Press, 1969, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=UVFGmt9EQ3sC]&lt;/ref&gt; In the period of [[Khruschev thaw]], its main auditorium was the place for public performances of [[Andrei Voznesensky]], [[Robert Rozhdestvensky]] and [[Bulat Okudzhava]]. This was also a place for popular science lectures given by [[Élie Metchnikoff]], [[Alexander Fersman]] and [[Niels Bohr]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pmlectures.ru/about About Public Lectures at the Polytechnical Museum (in Russian)]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:OutletPlug.jpg|thumb|upright|Power cord, with plug at end, plugged into a Japanese outlet with ground post, for a washing machine.]]

A '''power cord''', '''line cord''', or '''mains cable''' is an [[electrical cable]] that temporarily connects an [[electrical appliance|appliance]] to the [[mains electricity]] supply via a [[wall socket]] or [[extension cord]]. The terms are generally used for cables using a [[AC power plugs and sockets|power plug]] to connect to a single-phase [[alternating current]] power source at the local line voltage&amp;mdash;(generally 100 to 240 volts, depending on the location). The terms '''[[power cable]]''', '''mains lead''', '''flex''' or '''kettle lead''' are also used. A '''lamp cord''' (also known as a '''[[zip cord]]''') is a light-weight, ungrounded, single-insulated two-wire cord used for small loads such as a table or floor lamp.

A '''cord set''' includes connectors molded to the cord at each end (see [[Appliance coupler]]). Cord sets are detachable from both the power supply and the electrical equipment, and consist of a flexible cord with electrical connectors at either end, one male, and one female. One end of the cord set is attached to a molded electrical plug; the other is typically a molded electrical receptacle to prevent the possibility of having an exposed live prong or pin which would cause electric shock. The female connector attaches to the piece of equipment or appliance while the male plug connects to the electrical receptacle or outlet.

==Features==
Power cables may be either fixed or detachable from the appliance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lzVrAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Power+cables+may+be+either+fixed+or+detachable+from+the+appliance&amp;dq=Power+cables+may+be+either+fixed+or+detachable+from+the+appliance&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjNgeHPnNLUAhVX0mMKHYMSB6EQ6AEILDAB|title=Handbook of bioengineering|last=Skalak|first=Richard|last2=Chien|first2=Shu|date=1987|publisher=McGraw-Hill|isbn=9780070577831|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of detachable leads, the appliance end of the power cord has a female connector to link it to the appliance, to avoid the dangers from having a live protruding pin. Cords may also have twist-locking features, or other attachments to prevent accidental disconnection at one or both ends. A cord set may include accessories such as [[fuse (electrical)|fuses]] for overcurrent protection, a [[pilot lamp]] to indicate voltage is present, or a [[residual-current device|leakage current detector]]. Power cords for sensitive instruments, or audio/video equipment may also include a [[Shielded cable|shield]] over the power conductors to minimize [[electromagnetic interference]].

A power cord or [[appliance coupler]] may have a retaining clamp, a mechanical device that prevents it from inadvertently being pulled or shaken loose. Typical application areas with stricter safety requirements include [[medical technology]], stage and lighting technology, and computing equipment. For specialty equipment such as construction machinery, sound and lighting equipment, emergency medical [[defibrillator]]s and electrical power tools, used in locations without a convenient power source, extension cords are used to carry the electric current up to hundreds of feet away from an outlet.

In North America, the [[National Electrical Manufacturers Association]] develops standards for electrical plugs and receptacles and cables.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nema.org/prod/wire/cords/ NEMA - Flexible Cords Section] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111103090900/http://www.nema.org/prod/wire/cords/ |date=2011-11-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

International power cords and plug adapters are used in conjunction with electrical appliances in countries different from those in which they were designed to operate. Besides a cord with one end compatible to receptacles or a device from one country and the other end compatible with receptacles or devices from another country, a [[voltage converter]] is usually necessary, as well, to protect travelers' electronic devices, such as laptops, from the differing voltages between the United States and places like Europe or Africa.

North American lamp cords have two single-insulated conductors designed for low-current applications. The insulator covering one of the conductors is ribbed (parallel to wire) for the entire length of the cord, while the other conductor's insulator is smooth. The smooth one is hot and the ribbed one is neutral.&lt;ref&gt;Merle Henkenius; Popular Mechanics Dec 1987 How to Repair an Incandescent Lamp:Installing an in-line switch; p.130; [https://books.google.com/books?id=G-MDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA130&amp;lpg=PA130&amp;dq=%2B%22lamp+cord%22+%2B%22ribbed%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ncHjzC3cA2&amp;sig=p08YXQxEGFNbuqgWSujfnggwXBU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=-UFtT-H9Iajq0gGKxoy1Bg&amp;ved=0CE0Q6AEwAzgo#v=onepage&amp;q=%2B%22lamp%20cord%22%20%2B%22ribbed%22&amp;f=false] (retrieved 3/23/12)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Connectors==
[[IEC 60320]] power cables come in normal and high-temperature variants, as well as various rated currents. The connectors have slightly different shapes to ensure that it is not possible to substitute a cable with a lower temperature or current rating, but that it ''is'' possible to use an overrated cable. Cords also have different types of exterior jackets available to accommodate environmental variables such as moisture, temperature, oils, sunlight, flexibility, and heavy wear. For example, a heating appliance may come with a cord designed to withstand accidental contact with heated surfaces.

Worldwide, more than a dozen different types of [[AC power plugs and sockets]] are used for fixed [[Electrical wiring|building wiring]]. Products sold in many different markets can use a standardized IEC 60320 connector and then use a detachable power cord to match the local electrical outlets.  This simplifies safety approvals, factory testing, and production since the power cord is a low-cost item available as a commodity. Since the same types of appliance-side connectors are used with both 110&amp;nbsp;V and 230&amp;nbsp;V power cables, the user must ensure the connected equipment will operate with the available voltage. Some devices have a slide-switch to adapt to different voltages, or wide-ranging power supplies.

==Standards==
National electrical codes may apply to power cords and related items. For example, in the United States, power cords must meet [[UL (safety organization)|UL]] Standards 62&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Power supplies==
Cord sets must be distinguished from [[AC adapter]]s, where the connector also contains a [[transformer]], and possibly rectifiers, filters and regulators. Unwary substitution of a standard mains-voltage connector for the power supply would result in application of full line voltage to the connected device, resulting in its destruction and possible fire or personal injury.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15490">[[File:Active loudspeaker.svg|thumb|250px|right|An active full-range loudspeaker]]
'''Powered speakers''', also known as '''self-powered speakers''' and '''active speakers''', are [[loudspeaker]]s that have built-in [[amplifier]]s. Powered speakers are used in a range of settings, including in [[sound reinforcement system]]s (used at live music concerts), both for the main speakers facing the audience and the [[Foldback (sound engineering)|monitor speakers]] facing the performers; by [[DJ]]s performing at dance events and [[rave]]s; in private homes as part of [[hi-fi]] or [[home cinema]] audio systems and as [[computer speaker]]s. They can be connected directly to a [[mixing console]] or other low-level [[audio signal]] source without the need for an external amplifier. Some active speakers designed for sound reinforcement system use have an onboard [[mixing console]] and [[microphone preamplifier]], which enables microphones to be connected directly to the speaker. 

Active speakers have several advantages, the most obvious being their compactness and simplicity. Additionally the amplifier(s) can be designed to closely match the optimal requirements of the speaker it will power; and the speaker designer is not required to include a passive crossover, decreasing production cost and possibly sound quality. Some also claim that the shorter distances between components can decrease external interference and increase fidelity; although this is highly dubious, and the reciprocal argument can also be made. Disadvantages include heavier [[loudspeaker enclosure]]s; reduced reliability due to active electronic components within; and the need to supply both the audio signal and power to every unit separately, typically requiring two cables to be run to each speaker (as opposed to the single cable required with passive speakers and an external amplifier).

Powered speakers are available with passive or active [[audio crossover|crossovers]] built into them. Since the early 2000s, powered speakers with active crossovers and other DSP have become common in [[Sound reinforcement system|sound reinforcement]] applications and in [[studio monitor]]s.&lt;ref name=Kuells2001&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.livesoundint.com/archives/2001/septoct/active/active.php |title=Amped Up: Active Speaker Designs: Less Cost for a Total System? |last=Kuells |first=Jeff |date=September–October 2001 |work=Live Sound International}}&lt;/ref&gt; Home theater and add-on domestic/automotive [[subwoofer]]s have used active powered speaker technology since the late 1980s.

== Differences ==
[[File:AppleDesign Powered Speakers (M6082) back.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A powered computer speaker.]]
The terms "powered" and "active" have been used interchangeably in loudspeaker designs, however, a differentiation may be made between the terms:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/dec03/articles/qanda.htm#1 |title=Questions &amp; Answers |last=Robjohns |first=Hugh |work=Sound On Sound |date=December 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In a passive loudspeaker system the low-level audio signal is first amplified by an external power amplifier before being sent to the loudspeaker where the signal is split by a passive crossover into the appropriate frequency ranges before being sent to the individual drivers. This design is common in [[home audio]] as well as professional concert audio.
*A powered loudspeaker works the same way as a passive speaker, but the power amplifier is built into the loudspeaker enclosure. This design is common in compact personal speakers such as those used to amplify portable digital music devices.
*In a fully active loudspeaker system each driver has its own dedicated power amplifier. The low-level audio signal is first sent through an active crossover to split the audio signal into the appropriate frequency ranges before being sent to the power amplifiers and then on to the drivers. This design is commonly seen in studio monitors and professional concert audio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_QjxMkx_w1wC&amp;pg=PA70 |page=70 |title=An Introduction to Music Technology |last=Hosken |first=Dan |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |year=2010 |isbn=0-415-87827-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RDfKSh3Q8kAC&amp;pg=PA718 |page=718 |title=Audio Engineering: Know It All |last1=Self |first1=Douglas |last2=Sinclair |first2=Ian |last3=Duncan |first3=Ben |publisher=Newnes |year=2008 |isbn=1-85617-526-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hybrid active designs exist such as having three drivers powered by two internal amplifiers. In this case, an active two-way crossover splits the audio signal, usually into low frequencies and mid-high frequencies. The low-frequency driver is driven by its own amplifier channel while the mid- and high-frequency drivers share an amplifier channel, the output of which is split by a passive two-way crossover.

===Integrated active systems===
The term "active speakers" can also refer to an integrated "active system"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tnt-audio.com/casse/active_speakers_intro1_e.html |title=Sounding passive? Get active! – Part I |publisher=TNT-Audio (online) |last=Wheeler |first=Mark |date=March–June 2006 |issn=1825-4853 |accessdate=November 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which passive loudspeakers are mated to an external system of multiple amplifiers fed by an active crossover. These active loudspeaker systems may be built for professional concert touring such as the pioneering JM-3 system designed in 1971 by [[McCune Audio/Video/Lighting|Harry McCune Sound Service]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prosoundweb.com/chat_psw/transcripts/jmeyer.shtml Transcript PSW LIVE CHAT with John Meyer]&lt;/ref&gt; or they may be built for [[High-end audio|high-end home use]] such as various systems from [[Naim Audio]] and [[Linn Products]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tnt-audio.com/casse/active_speakers_intro1_e.html |title=Sounding passive? Get active! – Part II |publisher=TNT-Audio (online) |last=Wheeler |first=Mark |date=March–June 2006 |issn=1825-4853 |accessdate=November 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Some of the first powered loudspeakers were [[JBL]] monitor speakers.  With the addition of the SE401 Stereo Energizer, introduced in 1964, any pair of monitor speakers could be converted to self-powered operation with the second speaker powered by the first.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lansingheritage.org/images/jbl/catalogs/1964/page43.jpg JBL Solid State Stereo Energizer]&lt;/ref&gt; The first studio monitor with an active crossover was the OY invented 1967 by Klein-Hummel. It was a hybrid three-way design with two internal amplifier channels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sennheiser.com/klein-hummel/icm_en.nsf/root/prof-monitoring_discontinued-monitors_OY |archive-url=https://archive.is/20090612135859/http://www.sennheiser.com/klein-hummel/icm_en.nsf/root/prof-monitoring_discontinued-monitors_OY |dead-url=yes |archive-date=June 12, 2009 |title=OY – Control Monitor |work=Klein + Hummel |publisher=Sennheiser |accessdate=November 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; An early example of a bi-amplified powered studio monitor is the Altec 9846B, introduced in 1971, which combined the passive 9846-8A speaker with the new 771B Bi-amplifier with 60 watts for the [[woofer]] and 30 watts for the high frequency [[compression driver]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lansingheritage.org/images/altec/catalogs/1971-monitor/page6.jpg Altec 1971 Monitor catalog]&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1970s, [[Paramount Pictures]] contracted with AB Systems to design a powered speaker system.&lt;ref name=Kuells2001/&gt;

In 1980, [[Meyer Sound Laboratories]] produced an integrated active 2-way system, the passive UPA-1, which incorporated lessons [[John Meyer (audio engineer)|John Meyer]] learned on the McCune JM-3.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://edition.pagesuite-professional.co.uk/launch.aspx?referral=other&amp;pnum=44&amp;refresh=g06DXd131L4x&amp;EID=d85639f5-d173-4f3e-8889-c046966f2662&amp;skip=&amp;p=44 |title=Classic Gear: The Meyer UPA-1 |work=Lighting &amp; Sound |date=May 2009 |page=44 |last=Halliday |first=Rob}}&lt;/ref&gt; It used active electronics mounted outside of the loudspeaker enclosure, including Meyer's integrated active crossover with feedback comparator circuits determining the level of limiting, often connected to third-party customer-specified amplifiers. In 1990, Meyer produced its first powered speaker: the HD-1, a 2-way studio monitor with all internal electronics.&lt;ref name=Kuells2001/&gt; In the early '90s, after years of dealing with the disadvantages of passive systems, especially varying gain settings on third-party amplifiers, John Meyer decided to stop making passive speakers and devote his company to active designs. Meyer said he "hired an ad agency to research how people felt about powered speakers for sound reinforcement, and they came back after a survey and said that nobody wanted them."&lt;ref name=MeyerPowered&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.meyersound.com/about/our_story/pioneering_self-powered/ |title=Pioneering Self-Powered Loudspeakers for Over 11 Years |publisher=Meyer Sound Laboratories |accessdate=November 13, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161224031916/http://www.meyersound.com/about/our_story/pioneering_self-powered/ |archivedate=December 24, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sound reinforcement system]] operators said they did not want loudspeakers in which they could not see the amplifier meters to determine whether the loudspeakers were working properly during a concert. Nevertheless, Meyer kept to his decision and produced the MSL-4 in 1994, the first powered loudspeaker intended for concert touring.&lt;ref name=MeyerPowered/&gt; The UPA-1 was converted to a self-powered configuration in 1996 and the rest of Meyer's product line followed suit.

==Advantages and disadvantages==
===Fidelity===
The main benefit of active versus passive speakers is in the higher fidelity associated with active crossovers and multiple amplifiers, including less IMD, higher dynamic range and greater output power.&lt;ref name="Duncan1996"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ma7qKuwH-nIC&amp;pg=PA31|title=High performance audio power amplifiers|last=Duncan|first=Ben|publisher=Newnes|year=1996|isbn=0-7506-2629-1|pages=28–31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The amplifiers within the loudspeaker enclosure may be ideally matched to the individual drivers, eliminating the need for each amplifier channel to operate in the entire audio bandpass. Driver characteristics such as power handling and impedance may be matched to amplifier capabilities.&lt;ref name=Kuells2001/&gt; More specifically, active speakers have very short [[speaker cable]]s inside the enclosure, so very little voltage and control is lost in long speaker cables with higher resistance.

An active speaker often incorporates equalization tailored to each driver's response in the enclosure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hometheaterhifi.com/volume_9_4/feature-article-active-speakers-12-2002.html |title=The Benefits of an Active Speaker Lifestyle |date=December 2002 |last=Miller |first=Colin |work=Secrets of Home Theater and High Fidelity |accessdate=November 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This yields a flatter, more neutral sound. Limiting circuits (high-ratio [[Dynamic range compression|audio compression]] circuits) can be incorporated to increase the likelihood of the driver surviving high-SPL use. Such limiters may be carefully matched to driver characteristics, resulting in a more dependable loudspeaker requiring less service. Distortion detection may be designed into the electronics to help determine the onset of protective limiting, reducing output distortion and eliminating [[Clipping (audio)|clipping]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w9B2kgjxl4cC&amp;pg=PA31 |pages=31–32 |title=Sound systems: design and optimization: modern techniques and tools for sound system design and alignment |last=McCarthy |first=Bob |publisher=Focal Press |year=2007 |isbn=0-240-52020-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cabling===
Passive speakers need only one speaker cable but active speakers need two cables: an audio signal cable and an AC power cable. For multiple-enclosure high-power concert systems, the AC cabling is often smaller in diameter than the equivalent speaker cable bundles, so less copper is used. Some powered speaker manufacturers are now incorporating UHF or more frequently [[Wi-Fi]] wireless receivers so the speaker requires only an AC power cable.

===Weight===
A powered speaker usually weighs more than an equivalent passive speaker because the internal amplifier circuitry usually outweighs a speaker-level passive crossover. A loudspeaker associated with an integrated active system is even lighter because it has no internal crossover. A lightweight loudspeaker can be more easily carried and it is less of a load in rigging (flying). However, active speakers using lightweight [[Class-D amplifier]]s have narrowed the difference. Trucking for a sound system involves transporting all of the various components including amplifier racks, speaker cabling and loudspeaker enclosures. Overall shipping weight for an active loudspeaker system may be less than for a passive system because heavy passive speaker cable bundles are replaced by lighter AC cables and small diameter signal cables. Truck space and weight is reduced by eliminating amplifier racks.&lt;ref name=Kuells2001/&gt;

===Cost===
The expense of a large concert active speaker system is less than the expense of an equivalent passive system.&lt;ref name=Kuells2001/&gt; The passive system, or integrated active system with external electronics, requires separate components such as crossovers, equalizers, limiters and amplifiers, all mounted in rolling racks. Cabling for passive concert systems is heavy, large-diameter speaker cable, more expensive than smaller diameter AC power cables and much smaller audio signal cables. For high-end home use, active speakers usually cost more than passive speakers because of the additional amplifier channels required.&lt;ref name=Duncan1996/&gt;

===Ease of use===
In professional audio and some home cinema and hi-fi applications, the active speaker may be easier to use because it eliminates the complexity of properly setting crossover frequencies, equalizer curves and limiter thresholds. Cabling is not as simple, however, because active speakers require two cables instead of one (an AC power cable and a cable with the signal, typically an [[XLR connector|XLR]] cable). In home audio, some audio engineers argue that a passive speaker, in which an unpowered speaker is connected to an amplifier, is the easiest to install and operate.

==Servo-driven speakers==
By including a [[negative feedback]] loop in the amplifier-speaker system, distortion can be substantially reduced. If mounted at the speaker cone, the sensor is usually an accelerometer. It is possible to monitor the back [[Electromotive force|emf]] generated by the driver voice coil as it moves within the magnetic gap. In either case, specialist amplifier designs are needed and so servo speakers are inherently powered speakers.

==Bass amplifiers==
Some [[bass amplifier]] manufacturers sell powered speakers designed for adding to the stage power of a combo bass amp. The user plugs a patch cord or XLR cable from the combo amp into the powered speaker.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="37008">'''Production''' is a process of combining various material inputs and immaterial inputs (plans, know-how) in order to make something for consumption (the output). It is the act of creating [[output (economics)|output]], a [[goods and  services|good or service]] which has [[value (economics)|value]] and contributes to the [[utility (economics)|utility]] of individuals.&lt;ref&gt;"Kotler", P., Armstrong, G., Brown, L., and Adam, S. (2006) ''Marketing'', 7th Ed. Pearson Education Australia/Prentice Hall.&lt;/ref&gt;

Economic well-being is created in a production process, meaning all economic activities that aim directly or indirectly to satisfy human wants and [[need]]s. The degree to which the needs are satisfied is often accepted as a measure of economic well-being. In production there are two features which explain increasing economic well-being. They are improving quality-price-ratio of goods and services and increasing incomes from growing and more efficient market production.

The most important forms of production are:
* [[Market (economics)|market production]]
* [[Public economics|public production]]
* [[household production]]

In order to understand the origin of the economic well-being, we must understand these three production processes. All of them produce commodities which have value and contribute to well-being of individuals.

The satisfaction of needs originates from the use of the commodities which are produced. The need satisfaction increases when the quality-price-ratio of the commodities improves and more satisfaction is achieved at less cost. Improving the quality-price-ratio of commodities is to a producer an essential way to improve the competitiveness of products but this kind of gains distributed to customers cannot be measured with production data. Improving the competitiveness of products means often to the producer lower product prices and therefore losses in incomes which are to compensated with the growth of sales volume.

Economic well-being also increases due to the growth of incomes that are gained from the growing and more efficient market production. Market production is the only production form which creates and distributes incomes to stakeholders. Public production and household production are financed by the incomes generated in market production. Thus market production has a double role in creating well-being, i.e. the role of producing goods and services and the role of creating income. Because of this double role market production is the “primus motor” of economic well-being and therefore here under review.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

==As a source of economic well-being==
In principle there are two main activities in an economy, production and consumption. Similarly there are two kinds of actors, producers and consumers. Well-being is made possible by efficient production and by the interaction between producers and consumers. In the interaction, consumers can be identified in two roles both of which generate well-being. Consumers can be both customers of the producers and suppliers to the producers. The customers’ well-being arises from the commodities they are buying and the suppliers’ well-being is related to the income they receive as compensation for the production inputs they have delivered to the producers.

===Stakeholders of production===

Stakeholders of production are persons, groups or organizations with an interest in a producing company. Economic well-being originates in efficient production and it is distributed through the interaction between the company’s stakeholders. The stakeholders of companies are economic actors which have an economic interest in a company. Based on the similarities of their interests, stakeholders can be classified into three groups in order to differentiate their interests and mutual relations. The three groups are as follows:
[[File:Interactive contributions of a company’s stakeholders.png|400 px|thumb|right|Interactive contributions of a company’s stakeholders (Saari, 2011,4)]]

*Customers
*Suppliers
*Producers.
The interests of these stakeholders and their relations to companies are described briefly below. Our purpose is to establish a framework for further analysis. 
 
''Customers''

The customers of a company are typically consumers, other market producers or producers in the public sector. Each of them has their individual production functions. Due to competition, the price-quality-ratios of commodities tend to improve and this brings the benefits of better productivity to customers. Customers get more for less. In households and the public sector this means that more need satisfaction is achieved at less cost. For this reason the productivity of customers can increase over time even though their incomes remain unchanged.

''Suppliers''

The suppliers of companies are typically producers of materials, energy, capital, and services. They all have their individual production functions. The changes in prices or qualities of supplied commodities have an effect on both actors’ (company and suppliers) production functions. We come to the conclusion that the production functions of the company and its suppliers are in a state of continuous change.

''Producer community''

The incomes are generated for those participating in production, i.e., the labour force, society and owners. These stakeholders are referred to here as producer communities or, in shorter form, as producers. The producer communities have a common interest in maximizing their incomes. These parties that contribute to production receive increased incomes from the growing and developing production.

The well-being gained through commodities stems from the price-quality relations of the commodities. Due to competition and development in the market, the price-quality relations of commodities tend to improve over time. Typically the quality of a commodity goes up and the price goes down over time. This development favourably affects the production functions of customers. Customers get more for less. Consumer customers get more satisfaction at less cost. This type of well-being generation can only partially be calculated from the production data. The situation is presented in this study.
The producer community (labour force, society, and owners) earns income as compensation for the inputs they have delivered to the production. When the production grows and becomes more efficient, the income tends to increase. In production this brings about an increased ability to pay salaries, taxes and profits. The growth of production and improved productivity generate additional income for the producing community. Similarly the high income level achieved in the community is a result of the high volume of production and its good performance. This type of well-being generation – as mentioned earlier - can be reliably calculated from the production data.

===Main processes of a producing company===
A producing company can be divided into sub-processes in different ways; yet, the following five are identified as main processes, each with a logic, objectives, theory and key figures of its own. It is important to examine each of them individually, yet, as a part of the whole, in order to be able to measure and understand them. The main processes of a company are as follows:
[[File:Main processes of a company.png|400px|thumb|Main processes of a producing company (Saari 2006,3)]]
* real process.
* income distribution process
* production process.
* monetary process.
* market value process.
Production output is created in the real process, gains of production are distributed in the income distribution process and these two processes constitute the production process. The production process and its sub-processes, the real process and income distribution process occur simultaneously, and only the production process is identifiable and measurable by the traditional [[accounting]] practices. The real process and income distribution process can be identified and measured by extra calculation, and this is why they need to be analyzed separately in order to understand the logic of production and its performance.

Real process generates the production output from input, and it can be described by means of the [[production function]]. It refers to a series of events in production in which production inputs of different quality and quantity are combined into products of different quality and quantity. Products can be physical goods, immaterial services and most often combinations of both. The characteristics created into the product by the producer imply [[surplus value]] to the consumer, and on the basis of the market price this value is shared by the consumer and the producer in the marketplace. This is the mechanism through which surplus value originates to the consumer and the producer likewise. Surplus values to customers cannot be measured from any production data. Instead the surplus value to a producer can be measured. It can be expressed both in terms of nominal and real values. The real surplus value to the producer is an outcome of the real process, real income, and measured proportionally it means productivity.

The concept “real process” in the meaning quantitative structure of production process was introduced in Finnish management accounting in 1960s. Since then it has been a cornerstone in the Finnish management accounting theory. (Riistama et al. 1971)

Income distribution process of the production refers to a series of events in which the unit prices of constant-quality products and inputs alter causing a change in income distribution among those participating in the exchange. The magnitude of the change in income distribution is directly proportionate to the change in prices of the output and inputs and to their quantities. [[Productivity]] gains are distributed, for example, to customers as lower product sales prices or to staff as higher income pay.

The production process consists of the real process and the income distribution process. A result and a criterion of success of the owner is profitability. The profitability of production is the share of the real process result the owner has been able to keep to himself in the income distribution process. Factors describing the production process are the components of [[Profit (accounting)|profitability]], i.e., returns and costs. They differ from the factors of the real process in that the components of profitability are given at nominal prices whereas in the real process the factors are at periodically fixed prices.

Monetary process refers to events related to financing the business. Market value process refers to a series of events in which investors determine the market value of the company in the investment markets.

===Production growth and performance===
{{Main article|Economic growth}}
Economic growth is often defined as a production increase of an output of a production process. It is usually expressed as a growth percentage depicting growth of the real production output. The real output is the real value of products produced in a production process and when we subtract the real input from the real output we get the real income. The real output and the real income are generated by the real process of production from the real inputs.

The real process can be described by means of the production function. The production function is a graphical or mathematical expression showing the relationship between the inputs used in production and the output achieved. Both graphical and mathematical expressions are presented and demonstrated. The production function is a simple description of the mechanism of income generation in production process.  It consists of two components. These components are a change in production input and a change in productivity.&lt;ref&gt;Genesca &amp; Grifell 1992, Saari 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Components of economic growth.png|left|thumb|300px|Components of economic growth (Saari 2006,2)]]

The figure illustrates an income generation process(exaggerated for clarity). The Value T2 (value at time 2) represents the growth in output from Value T1 (value at time 1). Each time of measurement has its own graph of the production function for that time (the straight lines). The output measured at time 2 is greater than the output measured at time one for both of the components of growth: an increase of inputs and an increase of productivity. The portion of growth caused by the increase in inputs is shown on line 1 and does not change the relation between inputs and outputs. The portion of growth caused by an increase in productivity is shown on line 2 with a steeper slope. So increased productivity represents greater output per unit of input.

The growth of production output does not reveal anything about the performance of the production process. The performance of production measures production’s ability to generate income. Because the income from production is generated in the real process, we call it the real income. Similarly, as the production function is an expression of the real process, we could also call it “income generated by the production function”.

The real income generation follows the logic of the production function. Two components can also be distinguished in the income change: the income growth caused by an increase in production input (production volume) and the income growth caused by an increase in productivity. The income growth caused by increased production volume is determined by moving along the production function graph. The income growth corresponding to a shift of the production function is generated by the increase in productivity. The change of real income so signifies a move from the point 1 to the point 2 on the production function (above). When we want to maximize the production performance we have to maximize the income generated by the production function.

The sources of productivity growth and production volume growth are explained as follows. Productivity growth is seen as the key economic indicator of innovation. The successful introduction of new products and new or altered processes, organization structures, systems, and business models generates growth of output that exceeds the growth of inputs. This results in growth in productivity or output per unit of input. Income growth can also take place without innovation through replication of established technologies. With only replication and without innovation, output will increase in proportion to inputs. (Jorgenson et al. 2014,2) This is the case of income growth through production volume growth.

Jorgenson et al. (2014,2) give an empiric example. They show that the great preponderance of economic growth in the US since 1947 involves the replication of existing technologies through investment in equipment, structures, and software and expansion of the labor force. Further they show that innovation accounts for only about twenty percent of US economic growth.

In the case of a single production process (described above) the output is defined as an economic value of products and services produced in the process. When we want to examine an entity of many production processes we have to sum up the value-added created in the single processes. This is done in order to avoid the double accounting of intermediate inputs. Value-added is obtained by subtracting the intermediate inputs from the outputs. The most well-known and used measure of value-added is the GDP (Gross Domestic Product). It is widely used as a measure of the economic growth of nations and industries.

===Absolute (total) and average income===

The production performance can be measured as an average or an absolute income. Expressing performance both in average (avg.) and absolute (abs.) quantities is helpful for understanding the welfare effects of production. For measurement of the average production performance, we use the known productivity ratio

* Real output / Real input.

The absolute income of performance is obtained by subtracting the real input from the real output as follows:
* Real income (abs.) = Real output&amp;nbsp;– Real input

The growth of the real income is the increase of the economic value which can be distributed between the production stakeholders. With the aid of the production model we can perform the average and absolute accounting in one calculation. Maximizing production performance requires using the absolute measure, i.e. the real income and its derivatives as a criterion of production performance.

Maximizing productivity also leads to the phenomenon called "[[jobless recovery|jobless growth]]" This refers to economic growth as a result of productivity growth but without creation of new jobs and new incomes from them. A practical example illustrates the case. When a jobless person obtains a job in market production we may assume it is a low productivity job. As a result, average productivity decreases but the real income per capita increases. Furthermore, the well-being of the society also grows. This example reveals the difficulty to interpret the total productivity change correctly. The combination of volume increase and total productivity decrease leads in this case to the improved performance because we are on the “diminishing returns” area of the production function. If we are on the part of “increasing returns” on the production function, the combination of production volume increase and total productivity increase leads to improved production performance. Unfortunately we do not know in practice on which part of the production function we are. Therefore, a correct interpretation of a performance change is obtained only by measuring the real income change.

==Production models==
A production model is a numerical description of the production process and is based on the prices and the quantities of inputs and outputs. There are two main approaches to operationalize the concept of production function. We can use mathematical formulae, which are typically used in macroeconomics (in growth accounting) or arithmetical models, which are typically used in microeconomics and management accounting. We do not present the former approach here but refer to the survey “Growth accounting” by Hulten 2009.

We use here arithmetical models because they are like the models of management accounting, illustrative and easily understood and applied in practice. Furthermore, they are integrated to management accounting, which is a practical advantage. A major advantage of the arithmetical model is its capability to depict production function as a part of production process. Consequently, production function can be understood, measured, and examined as a part of production process.

There are different production models according to different interests. Here we use a production income model and a production analysis model in order to demonstrate production function as a phenomenon and a measureable quantity.

===Production income model===
[[File:Profitability of production measured by surplus value.png|left|thumb|400px|Profitability of production measured by surplus value (Saari 2006,3)]]

The scale of success run by a going concern is manifold, and there are no criteria that might be universally applicable to success. Nevertheless, there is one criterion by which we can generalise the rate of success in production. This criterion is the ability to produce surplus value. As a criterion of profitability, surplus value refers to the difference between returns and costs, taking into consideration the costs of equity in addition to the costs included in the profit and loss statement as usual. Surplus value indicates that the output has more value than the sacrifice made for it, in other words, the output value is higher than the value (production costs) of the used inputs. If the surplus value is positive, the owner’s profit expectation has been surpassed.

The table presents a surplus value calculation. We call this set of production data a basic example and we use the data through the article in illustrative production models. The basic example is a simplified profitability calculation used for illustration and modelling. Even as reduced, it comprises all phenomena of a real measuring situation and most importantly the change in the output-input mix between two periods. Hence, the basic example works as an illustrative “scale model” of production without any features of a real measuring situation being lost. In practice, there may be hundreds of products and inputs but the logic of measuring does not differ from that presented in the basic example.

In this context we define the quality requirements for the production data used in productivity accounting. The most important criterion of good measurement is the homogenous quality of the measurement object. If the object is not homogenous, then the measurement result may include changes in both quantity and quality but their respective shares will remain unclear. In productivity accounting this criterion requires that every item of output and input must appear in accounting as being homogenous. In other words, the inputs and the outputs are not allowed to be aggregated in measuring and accounting. If they are aggregated, they are no longer homogenous and hence the measurement results may be biased.

Both the absolute and relative surplus value have been calculated in the example. Absolute value is the difference of the output and input values and the relative value is their relation, respectively. The surplus value calculation in the example is at a nominal price, calculated at the market price of each period.

===Production analysis model===
[[File:Productivity model.png|350px|thumb|[http://www.mido.fi/Index_tiedostot/Production%20Model%20Saari%202004%20e.htm Production Model Saari 2004] (Saari 2006,4)]]
A model &lt;ref&gt;Courbois &amp; Temple 1975, Gollop 1979, Kurosawa 1975, Saari 1976, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; used here is a typical production analysis model by help of which it is possible to calculate the outcome of the real process, income distribution process and production process. The starting point is a profitability calculation using surplus value as a criterion of profitability. The surplus value calculation is the only valid measure for understanding the connection between profitability and productivity or understanding the connection between real process and production process. A valid measurement of total productivity necessitates considering all production inputs, and the surplus value calculation is the only calculation to conform to the requirement. If we omit an input in productivity or income accounting, this means that the omitted input can be used unlimitedly in production without any cost impact on accounting results.

===Accounting and interpreting ===
The process of calculating is best understood by applying the term ''ceteris paribus'', i.e. "all other things being the same," stating that at a time only the impact of one changing factor be introduced to the phenomenon being examined. Therefore, the calculation can be presented as a process advancing step by step. First, the impacts of the income distribution process are calculated, and then, the impacts of the real process on the profitability of the production.

The first step of the calculation is to separate the impacts of the real process and the income distribution process, respectively, from the change in profitability (285.12&amp;nbsp;– 266.00 = 19.12). This takes place by simply creating one auxiliary column (4) in which a surplus value calculation is compiled using the quantities of Period 1 and the prices of Period 2. In the resulting profitability calculation, Columns 3 and 4 depict the impact of a change in income distribution process on the profitability and in Columns 4 and 7 the impact of a change in real process on the profitability.

The accounting results are easily interpreted and understood. We see that the real income has increased by 58.12 units from which 41.12 units come from the increase of productivity growth and the rest 17.00 units come from the production volume growth. The total increase of real income (58.12) is distributed to the stakeholders of production, in this case 39.00 units to the customers and to the suppliers of inputs and the rest 19.12 units to the owners.

Here we can make an important conclusion. Income formation of production is always a balance between income generation and income distribution. The income change created in a real process  (i.e. by production function) is always distributed to the stakeholders as economic values within the review period. Accordingly, the changes in real income and income distribution are always equal in terms of economic value.

Based on the accounted changes of productivity and production volume values we can explicitly conclude on which part of the production function the production is. The rules of interpretations are the following:

The production is on the part of “increasing returns” on the production function, when
* productivity and production volume increase or
* productivity and production volume decrease

The production is on the part of “diminishing returns” on the production function, when
* productivity decreases and volume increases or
* productivity increases and volume decreases.

In the basic example the combination of volume growth (+17.00) and productivity growth (+41.12) reports explicitly that the production is on the part of “increasing returns” on the production function (Saari 2006 a, 138–144).

Another production model ([http://www.mido.fi/Index_tiedostot/Production%20Model%20Saari%201989%20e.htm Production Model Saari 1989]) also gives details of the income distribution (Saari 2011,14). Because the accounting techniques of the two models are different, they give differing, although complementary, analytical information. The accounting results are, however, identical. We do not present the model here in detail but we only use its detailed data on income distribution, when the objective functions are formulated in the next section.

==Objective functions==
An efficient way to improve the understanding of production performance is to formulate different objective functions according to the objectives of the different interest groups. Formulating the [[objective function]] necessitates defining the variable to be maximized (or minimized). After that other variables are considered as constraints or free variables. The most familiar objective function is profit maximization which is also included in this case. [[Profit maximization]] is an objective function that stems from the owner’s interest and all other variables are constraints in relation to maximizing of profits in the organization.

[[File:Income formation.png|300px|right|thumb|Summary of objective function formulations (Saari 2011,17)]]

===The procedure for formulating objective functions===
The procedure for formulating different objective functions, in terms of the production model, is introduced next. In the income formation from production the following objective functions can be identified:
* Maximizing the real income
* Maximizing the producer income
* Maximizing the owner income.
These cases are illustrated using the numbers from the basic example. The following symbols are used in the presentation:
The equal sign (=) signifies the starting point of the computation or the result of computing and the plus or minus sign (+ / -) signifies a variable that is to be added or subtracted from the function. A producer means here the producer community, i.e. labour force, society and owners.

Objective function formulations can be expressed in a single calculation which concisely illustrates the logic of the income generation, the income distribution and the variables to be maximized.

The calculation resembles an [[income statement]] starting with the income generation and ending with the income distribution. The income generation and the distribution are always in balance so that their amounts are equal. In this case it is 58.12 units. The income which has been generated in the real process is distributed to the stakeholders during the same period. There are three variables which can be maximized. They are the real income, the producer income and the owner income. Producer income and owner income are practical quantities because they are addable quantities and they can be computed quite easily. Real income is normally not an addable quantity and in many cases it is difficult to calculate.

===The dual approach for the formulation===
Here we have to add that the change of real income can also be computed from the changes in income distribution. We have to identify the unit price changes of outputs and inputs and calculate their profit impacts (i.e. unit price change x quantity). The change of real income is the sum of these profit impacts and the change of owner income. This approach is called the dual approach because the framework is seen in terms of prices instead of quantities (ONS 3, 23).

The dual approach has been recognized in growth accounting for long but its interpretation has remained unclear. The following question has remained unanswered: “Quantity based estimates of the residual are interpreted as a shift in the production function, but what is the interpretation of the price-based growth estimates?” (Hulten 2009, 18). We have demonstrated above that the real income change is achieved by quantitative changes in production and the income distribution change to the stakeholders is its dual. In this case the duality means that the same accounting result is obtained by accounting the change of the total income generation (real income) and by accounting the change of the total income distribution.

{{globalize|date=June 2013}}
'''Radar MASINT''' is a subdiscipline of [[measurement and signature intelligence]] (MASINT) and refers to [[list of intelligence gathering disciplines|intelligence gathering]] activities that bring together disparate elements that do not fit within the definitions of [[signals intelligence]] (SIGINT), [[imagery intelligence]] (IMINT), or [[Human intelligence (espionage)|human intelligence]] (HUMINT).

According to the [[United States Department of Defense]], MASINT is technically derived intelligence (excluding traditional imagery IMINT and signals intelligence) that – when collected, processed, and analyzed by dedicated MASINT systems – results in intelligence that detects, tracks, identifies, or describes the distinctive characteristics target sources.  in the US MASINT was recognized as a formal intelligence discipline in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

As with many branches of MASINT, specific techniques may overlap with the six major conceptual disciplines of MASINT defined by the Center for MASINT Studies and Research, which divides MASINT into electro-optical, nuclear, geophysical, radar, materials, and radiofrequency disciplines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Radar MASINT is complementary to SIGINT.  While the ELINT subdiscipline of SIGINT analyzes the structure of radar directed on a target, radar MASINT is concerned with using specialized radar techniques that measure characteristics of targets.

Another MASINT subdiscipline, [[radiofrequency MASINT]], considers the unintentional radiation emitted from a radar transmitter (e.g., [[sidelobe]]s)

MASINT radar sensors may be on space, sea, air, and fixed or mobile platforms. Specialized MASINT radar techniques include line-of-sight (LOS), over-the-horizon, [[synthetic aperture radar]] (SAR), [[inverse synthetic aperture radar]] (ISAR) and multistatic. It involves the active or passive collection of energy reflected from a target or object by LOS, bistatic, or over-the-horizon radar systems. RADINT collection provides information on radar cross-sections, tracking, precise spatial measurements of components, motion and radar reflectance, and absorption characteristics for dynamic targets and objectives.

Radar MASINT can be active, with the MASINT platform both transmitting and receiving. In multistatic applications, there is physical separation among two or more receivers and transmitters. MASINT can also passively receive signals reflected from an enemy beam.

As with many intelligence disciplines, it can be a challenge to integrate the technologies into the active services, so they can be used by warfighters.&lt;ref name=Ives&gt;{{cite web

  | accessdate = 2007-10-03  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Still, radar has characteristics especially appropriate for MASINT. While there are radars (ISAR) that can produce images, radar pictures are generally not as sharp as those taken by optical sensors, but radar is largely independent of day or night, cloud or sun.  Radar can penetrate many materials, such as wooden buildings. Improving the resolution of an imaging radar requires that the antenna size is many times that of the radar wavelength. Wavelength is inversely proportional to frequency, so increasing the radar frequency can improve resolution. It can be difficult to generate high power at the higher frequencies, or problems such as attenuation by water in the atmosphere limit performance. In general, for a fixed sensor, electro-optical sensors, in UV, visual, or infrared spectra, will outperform imaging radar.&lt;ref name=LynxMTI&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SAR and ISAR are means of combining multiple radar samples, taken over time, to create the effect of a much larger antenna, far larger than would physically be possible, for a given radar frequency. As SAR and ISAR develop better resolution, there can be an argument if they still are MASINT sensors, or if they create images sufficiently sharp that they properly are IMINT sensors.  Radar can also merge with other sensors to give even more information, such as [[#Moving Target Indicator|moving target indicator]].  Radar generally must acquire its images from an angle, which often means that it can look into the sides of buildings, producing a movie-like record over time, and being able to form three-dimensional views over time.

===Counterartillery radar===

See [[Counter-battery radar]]

Three US radar systems exist for detecting hostile artillery fire and backtracking to its source, serving the dual requirements of warning of incoming fires and counterattacking the firer. While they are intended to be used in three tiers against artillery of different ranges, there can be a problem of having a threat of an unexpected type fired into an area covered by the wrong tier. Proper site selection and preparation is necessary for all types.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web
  | author = Daniel W. Caldwell
  | title = Radar planning, preparation and employment of 3-tiered coverage: LCMR, Q-36 and Q-37
  | url = http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Radar+planning,+preparation+and+employment+of+3-tiered+coverage:...-a0123856463
  | accessdate = 2000-10-19
  | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proper planning includes avoiding clutter sources such as land surfaces, vegetation, buildings, complex terrain, aircraft (particularly rotary wing) and particulate matter kicked up by wind or aircraft. The enemy may attempt to avoid the directional radar systems or even use electronic countermeasures, so active patrolling, and activating the radar at random times and in random directions will act as a counter-countermeasure. Complementary acoustic and electro-optical systems can compensate for the lack of omnidirectional coverage by the AN/TPQ-36 and AN/TPQ-37.

To complement the counterartillery radars, additional MASINT sensors include [[Geophysical MASINT#Modern Acoustic Artillery Locators|acoustic]] and [[Electro-optical MASINT#Tactical counter-artillery sensors|electro-optical systems]].

A variety of ground-to-ground radars serve in counterbattery and surveillance roles, and also have some capability to detect helicopters. The LCMR, AN/TPQ-36, and AN/TPQ-37 radars are ideally used in a layered detection system, for short, medium, and long range detection. LCMR is omnidirectional, but the other two are directional and need cueing from omnidirectional sensors such as the combined electro-optical and acoustic [[Electro-optical MASINT#Rocket launch spotter|Rocket Launch Spotter]] or a pure acoustic system such as [[Geophysical MASINT#HALO|HALO]] or [[Geophysical MASINT#UTAMS|UTAMS]]

====AN/TPQ-36 and −37 counterartillery radars====

These 1980-vintage systems are not man-portable, and are directional, but they do have longer range than the LCMR.

Physically heavier than the LCMR, the [[AN/TPQ-36 Firefinder radar]] can detect cannon, rockets, and mortars within its range:
:*Artillery: 14,500 meters
:*Mortars: 18,000 meters
:*Rockets: 24,000 meters

[[Image:MASINT-AF-Helo-AN-TPQ-36.jpg|thumb|AN/TPQ-36 medium-range Firefinder being positioned]]

It has a moving rather than omnidirectional antenna. Current improvements are intended to replace its old control computer with a laptop, enhance performance in high clutter environments, and increase the probability of detecting certain rockets.

First intended to provide a third tier against long-range threats, the [[AN/TPQ-37 Firefinder radar]] basic software filters out all other radar tracks with signatures of lesser-ranged threats. New software, required by the mortar threat in the Balkans, allows it to duplicate the Q-36 mortar detection range of 18 kilometers, while still detecting longer-range threats. Proper crew training should compensate for the reduced clutter rejection caused by accepting mortar signatures.

Standard TPQ-36/37 radars are semi-manual in their plotting. An Israeli enhancement makes the plotting fully digital

===Ground surveillance radar===

Portable, and intended for tactical use, is the man-portable surveillance and target acquisition radar ([[MSTAR]]), originally developed for British use in artillery spotting, as the primary users of MSTAR, like its predecessor, were and are artillery observation parties, although it may be used for ground reconnaissance and surveillance. The MSTAR entered UK service in early 1991, slightly accelerated for use in the Gulf War. Its official UK designation is Radar, GS, No 22. MSTAR was developed and produced in UK in the mid 1980s by Thorn EMI Electronics (now part of [[Thales Group|Thales]]).

It is a Doppler radar operating in the [[J Band]], and is capable of detecting, recognising and tracking helicopters, slow moving fixed-wing aircraft, tracked and wheeled vehicles and troops, as well as observing and adjusting the fall of shot. The US uses it used as AN/PPS-5B and −5C Ground Surveillance Radar (GSR) Sets, and Australia calls its version AMSTAR.

The GSR is a ground-to-ground surveillance radar set for use by units such as infantry and tank battalions. and [[Brigade Combat Team|BCT]] [[RSTA]] units. It can detect and locate moving personnel at ranges of 6&amp;nbsp;km and vehicles at ranges of 10&amp;nbsp;km, day or night under virtually all weather conditions. The radar has a maximum display range of 10,000 meters and the radar can alert the operator both aurally and visually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

These radars are more MASINT then general purpose radar, as the simpler ones have very little imaging power, but perhaps a light or sound indicating the direction and range of the threat.

===Fixed or semimobile ground installations===

The COBRA DANE ground station radar is an "AN/FPS-108, a phased array L-Band antenna containing 15,360 radiating elements occupying 95% of the roughly 100 by {{convert|100|ft|m|sing=on}} area of one face of the building housing the system. The antenna is oriented toward the west, monitoring the northern Pacific missile test areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

It can be used for observing long-range missiles, but is also appropriate for theater-level weapons, which may be addressed in regional arms limitation agreements, such as the [[Missile Technology Control Regime]] (MCTR). Where COBRA JUDY is built into a ship, this dual frequency (S- and X-band) radar is transportable, capable of operating on ships or on land, and optimized for monitoring medium range ballistic missiles and antimissile systems. It is air-transportable to deal with sudden monitoring contingencies.

=== Active line-of-sight satellite radar ===

The Soviet Union used a number of [[RORSAT|radar-equipped ocean reconnaissance satellites (RORSAT)]], which used strong radar systems, powered by an onboard nuclear reactor, to visualize vessels. These operated in the "pushbroom" manner, scanning a swath straight down.

US radar satellites, however, have emphasized SAR and ISAR.

== Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR) MASINT ==

A [[synthetic aperture radar]] (SAR) system, exploits the fast movement of an aircraft or satellite, simulating a large antenna by combining samples over time. This simulation is called the synthetic aperture.&lt;ref name=LynxMTI /&gt;

Coupled with other MASINT and IMINT sensors, SAR can provide a high-resolution day and night collection capability. Recorded over time, it can be excellent for tracking changes. When operated at appropriate frequencies, it has ground- and water-penetrating capability, and is good for picking objects out of deliberate or natural clutter.

SAR is not, however, a trivial computational task. As the real antenna moves past the target, the range between target and antenna changes, which must be considered in synthesizing the aperture.  In discussing SAR principles, Sandia National Laboratories also notes that, "for fine resolution systems, the range and azimuth processing is coupled (dependent on each other) which also greatly increases the computational processing".&lt;ref name=LynxMTI /&gt;

In spite of the difficulties, SAR has evolved to a size that can fit aboard a UAV. Flying on the [[MQ-1 Predator]], the Northrop Grumman AN/ZPQ-1 Tactical Endurance Synthetic Aperture Radar (Tesar) started operations, in March 1996, over Bosnia. The AN/ZPQ-1 uses a radar signal in the 10 – 20&amp;nbsp;GHz J-band, and can work in strip map, spot map, and MTI modes. These modes are applicable to a wide range of MASINT sensors.

Strip map imaging observes terrain parallel to the flight path or along a specified [[ground path]]. Resolution depends on range and swath width, and can vary from 0.3 to 1.0 metres.&lt;ref name=LynxMTI /&gt;

Compare the two. The radar is not affected by night or weather.

Spot map mode covers 800 x 800 metres or 2400 × 2400 metres. In MTI mode, moving targets are overlaid on a digital map.

As well as large SAR aircraft such as the [[E-8 Joint STARS|E-8 Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System (Joint STARS)]], whose AN/APY-3 radar has multiple modes including ground moving target indication, the US has highly classified radar satellites.  Quill launched in 1964, was the first radar satellite, essentially a prototype. A system originally called Lacrosse (or Lacros), Indigo, and finally Onyx appears to be the only US radar satellite system, using pushbroom scans and "spotlighting" SAR.&lt;ref name=DayRadar&gt;{{cite web

Given that the E-8 is a large aircraft that cannot defend itself, there are US attempts to move the E-8 capability into space, under a variety of names, most recently a simple "Space Radar". In an era of budget demands, however, this extremely costly new generation has not been launched.&lt;ref name=DayRadar /&gt;

The German Armed Forces' ([[Bundeswehr]]) military [[SAR-Lupe]] reconnaissance satellite system has been fully operational since 22 July 2008.

===SAR interferometry===
{{main|Interferometric synthetic aperture radar}}
This technique, first demonstrated in the 1970s from an army airborne system, has evolved considerably.  At first, it estimated the angle-of-arrival of backscatter power from a pixel on the ground by comparing the phase difference of the backscattered wave as measured at two different locations.  This information along with the traditional range and azimuth (Doppler) information allowed one to locate the imaged pixel in three-dimensions, and hence estimate the elevation of that pixel.  Elevation-mapping interferometric SAR systems have since become an important remote sensing technology, with a very specific height-mapping mission.  Interferometric SAR systems can now be obtained as [[Commercial off-the-shelf|commercial off-the-shelf (COTS)]] products.

Detection of mines, both on the active battlefield and in reconstituting nations with unexploded ordnance (UXO) remains a critical problem. As part of the Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program (SERDP), the [[U.S. Army Research Laboratory]] (ARL), starting in 1997, began an effort to collect, under extremely controlled condition, a library of UXO signatures.

==== UWB Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) ====
As part of a research program that began in 1988 to explore new opportunities opened by developments in [[Analog-to-digital converter|analog-to-digital (A/D) converter]] technology, the UWB SAR radar was built by scientists from the Army Research Laboratory to collect data on studies surrounding the foliage and ground-penetrative capabilities of impulse radar.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ressler|first=Marc|last2=Happ|first2=Lynn|last3=Nguyen|first3=Lam|last4=Ton|first4=Tuan|last5=Bennett|first5=Matthew|date=May 1995|title=The Army Research Laboratory ultra-wide band testbed radars|url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/522632/|journal=Proceedings International Radar Conference|volume=|pages=|isbn=0-7803-2121-9|via=IEEE Xplore Digital Library}}&lt;/ref&gt; The instrument is a 20–1100&amp;nbsp;MHz UWB SAR, mounted on a boom that travels, at 1&amp;nbsp;km/h, over a precisely measured range. 

The UWB SAR system allowed surveillance over large areas, which made it appealing to use for minefield detection and finding mine clusters rather than detecting individual mines. Capable of validating electromagnetic models and aiding in the development of target detection algorithms, it could transmit and receive waveforms with usable bandwidth from 50 to 1200 MHz. It was also fully [[Polarimetry|polarimetric]], allowing access to HH, HV, VH, and VV imagery.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Carin|first=Lawrence|last2=Geng|first2=Norbert|last3=McClure|first3=Mark|last4=Sichina|first4=Jeffrey|last5=Nguyen|first5=Lam|date=June 1999|title=Ultra-wideband synthetic aperture radar for mine field detection|url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/818978/|journal=Ultra- Wideband Short-Pulse Electromagnetics 4|volume=|pages=|doi=10.1109/UWBSP.1998.818978|isbn=0-306-46206-0|via=IEEE Xplore Digital Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The SAR is mounted on a 30-ton boom-lift platform, such that it can reproduce, consistently, the depression angles and swath of a representative airborne SAR. Multiple runs can be made with different frequency bands, power levels, resolution, polarization, and motion compensation methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.denix.osd.mil/denix/Public/News/OSD/UXO/Conferences/Forum/Deluca.pdf|title=Unexploded Ordnance Detection Experiments Using Ultra-Wideband Synthetic Aperture Radar|author=Clyde C. DeLuca|author2=Vincent Marinelli|author3=Marc Ressler|author4=Tuan Ton|last-author-amp=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Basic signatures are recorded over an area of ground that is free of buried metal, but otherwise identical to the [[UXO]] test area. Once the ground signatures are complete, runs are made over the test area.

A precursor to the UWB SAR system was the UWB test-bed radar, which acted as the basic sensor system for gathering foliage and ground-penetrating radar data. Constructed using [[Commercial off-the-shelf|commercial-off-the-shelf]] components, this system provided at least 1 GHz of bandwidth as well as the full polarization matrix for its tasks.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

====BoomSAR====
In the mid-1990s, the [[U.S. Army Research Laboratory]] designed and fielded BoomSAR, an ultra-wideband synthetic aperture radar (UWB SAR) technology, to detect and classify targets embedded in foliage or underground.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9WU0Thqk_vIC&amp;pg=PA580&amp;lpg=PA580&amp;dq=boomsar+arl&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=mI6YtO9bSw&amp;sig=ie_Gvm9Lsxts6mL5oULxedxtWoE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwij9pS9-uTbAhVJYK0KHYDYC3EQ6AEIXzAO#v=onepage&amp;q=boomsar%20arl&amp;f=false|title=Ultra-Wideband, Short-Pulse Electromagnetics 7|last=Sabath|first=Frank|last2=Mokole|first2=Eric L.|last3=Schenk|first3=Uwe|last4=Nitsch|first4=Daniel|date=2010-05-30|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=9780387377315|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/510656/|title=Low-frequency ultra-wideband synthetic aperture radar 1995 BoomSAR tests - IEEE Conference Publication|website=ieeexplore.ieee.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/516828/|title=The Army Research Laboratory ultra wideband BoomSAR - IEEE Conference Publication|website=ieeexplore.ieee.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers tested the feasibility of detecting and identifying buried unexploded bombs at low RF frequencies (50 to 1100 MHz). Originally, the system was mounted on a 150-ft-high mobile boom lift that was attached to a rail system on a building at ARL in Adelphi, MD.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Initial data analysis supported the establishment of test sites at the U.S. Army Yuma Proving Ground in Arizona and Eglin Air Force Base in Florida to collect more extensive field measurements.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

Non-DoD applications of BoomSAR include environmental remediation, military base cleanup, mine detection, tunnel detection, and pre-construction site analysis. The system also offers the possibility of high-resolution imaging.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

====Steel crater test area====

Once the basic terrain signature is known, signatures are being collected from terrain that has been disturbed in a controlled manner. One such environment is at the Yuma Proving Grounds, a desert area where an existing Unexploded Ordnance (UXO) test site, the Steel Crater Test Area, has been used for a variety of sensor calibrations. It contains buried land mines, wires, pipes, vehicles, 55-gallon drums, storage containers and arms caches.  For the Army studies to define the signatures of UXO detection, over 600 additional pieces of inert UXO were added to the Steel Crater Test Area, including bombs (250, 500, 750, 1000, and 2000&amp;nbsp;lb), mortars (60 and 81&amp;nbsp;mm), artillery shells (105 and 155&amp;nbsp;mm), 2.75-in. rockets, cluster submunitions (M42, BLU-63, M68, BLU-97, and M118), and mines (Gator, VS1.6, M12, PMN, and POM-Z).

===Coherent change detection (CCD)===

In the 1990s, a new SAR application of coherent SAR showed the ability the detection and measurement of very small changes in the earth's surface.  The simplest form of this technology, known as coherent change detection (CCD), had obvious military and intelligence applications, and is now a valuable tool for analysts.  CCD complements other sensors: knowing that the surface changed may mean that analysts can direct ground-penetrating radar on it, measure thermal signatures to see if something is generating heat under the ground, etc.

Compare radar CCD and optical equivalents of the same subject. The CCD would not have been affected by night or weather.

===Moving target indicator===

[[Moving target indication]]s (MTI), at first, might seem just an adjunct to imaging radar, allowing the operator to focus on the moving target. That which makes them peculiarly MASINT, however is, especially in combination with other sensors and reference material, allows the measurement of a movement signature. For example, a tank and a truck both might be measured at 40&amp;nbsp;km/h when on a road. If both turn onto unpaved ground, however, the signature of the truck is that it might slow significantly, or demonstrate much lateral instability. The tracked vehicle, however, might exhibit a signature of not slowing when going off-pavement.

There are several electronic approaches to MTI. One is a refinement of CCD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Its use in measuring the ground motion of earthquakes can complement seismic sensors for detecting concealed underground explosions, or the characteristics of those above ground.

Current research and development involves multiple coherent SAR collections to make even more sensitive measurements, with the capability to detect motion as small as 1&amp;nbsp;mm per year. The new techniques address many of the limiting factors associated with SAR interferometry, such as atmospheric induced distortions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference

alarm density change detection software to detect vehicles and smaller targets under foliage, under camouflage and in urban clutter, and developed tomographic (3D) imaging to detect and identify targets that have not relocated.  VHF/UHF SAR for building penetration, urban mapping and performing change detection of objects inside buildings.

Terrain characterization technologies were also developed, including the abilities to rapidly generate bald-earth terrain height estimates and to classify terrain features from multipass VHF/UHF SAR imagery. In September 2004, DARPA demonstrated real-time onboard change detection (vehicles and IEDs) and rapid ground-station tomographic processing, as well as rapid generation of bald earth digital elevation models (DEMs) using stereo processing. In parallel, the Air Force Targets Under Trees (TUT) program enhanced the VHF SAR by adding a 10&amp;nbsp;km swath width VHF-only mode, developing a real-time VHF change detection capability/

==Non-cooperative target recognition==
{{see also|Automatic target recognition}}
Driving research into Non-Cooperative Target Recognition (NCTR) is the fratricide problem, which, according to Army Maj. Bill McKean, is that "... our weapons can kill at a greater range than we can identify a target as friend or foe. Yet if you wait until you're close enough to be sure you are firing at an enemy, you've lost your advantage." The procedural approach of more restrictive rules of engagement (ROE), according to McKean, "What they found was, if you tighten the rules of engagement to the point that you reduce fratricide, the enemy begins inflicting greater casualties on you. "Waiting until you're sure in combat could mean becoming a casualty yourself.".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

:#Systems that align with the weapon or weapon sight and are pointed at the intended target, and send an  [[Identification friend or foe|identification friend or foe (IFF)]] signal at it. If it responds correctly, it is treated as friendly, but otherwise unknown. Challenges here include the interrogation becoming a source of electronic targeting for the enemy, and trusting a response.
:#"Don't shoot me" systems use a mesh of IFF interrogators that send challenges at a given position. Friendly forces identify in response, and the interrogators share the data. This may not work in terrain that may mask the challenge, response, or response sharing.
:#Situational awareness systems rely on periodic updates of positional data to help users locate friendly forces, as long as the responses are timely and not masked by terrain
:#Noncooperative target recognition systems measure signature using acoustic and thermal radiation, radio emissions, radar techniques, etc. Comparing the measurements to classic MASINT signatures characterize the target.

Radar offers the potential of non-cooperative target recognition (NCTR). These techniques, which could work if IFF systems fail, have been especially secret.  No one has yet proposed, however, NCTR that will be effective if a coalition partner is flying the same aircraft type as the enemy, as in Desert Storm. IFF, presumably with encryption, probably is the only answer to that problem.

NCTR on JEM specifically depends on the periodic rotation of the blades of a turbine, with variations caused by the geometry of the elements of the engine (e.g., multiple rotors, the cowling, exhaust, and stators). More generally, the idea of "micro-Doppler" mechanisms, from any mechanical movements in the target structure ("micro-motion dynamics"), extends the problem to cover more than rotating aircraft structures, but also automatic gait recognition of human beings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

ISAR is especially useful for NCTR, since it can provide a two-dimensional map of the micromovements.

Moving surfaces cause amplitude, Doppler frequency, and pulse modulation of the return. The amplitude modulation comes from moving surfaces of different reflectivity and angle of reflection. Doppler shifting of the returned signals is a function of the radar carrier frequency, as well as the speed of the radar source and target, with positive Doppler shift from surfaces moving toward the illuminator and negative shift of surfaces moving away from it. Moving surfaces impose a pulse width modulation.

Detecting modulation depends on the angle of the source versus the target; if the source is too far off-center with a turbine or other moving surface, the modulation may not be evident because the moving part of the engine is shielded by the engine mounting. Modulation increases, however, when the source is at right angles to the axis of rotation of the moving element of the target. For fully exposed moving elements, (e.g., propeller blades or helicopter rotors), modulation is a function of the radar beam being off-center to the center of the moving element.&lt;ref name=AnitaMod&gt;{{Cite web

==Multistatic radar MASINT==
The first radars used separate antennas for transmitting and receiving, until the development of the [[diplexer]] allowed the antenna to be shared, producing much more compact radar systems. Until the development of low-observability "[[Stealth technology|stealth]]" technologies, compact antenna size was prized.

One of the first principles of stealth technology was to shape the surface of aircraft so that they did not reflect the transmitted beam directly back at the shared antenna. Another technique was to absorb some of the radar in the coating of the aircraft.

The more separate radar receiving antennas there are, the more likely it is that a reflection will go to a receiver distant from the transmitter. The graphic shows the terminology in [[bistatic radar]], with a separate receiver and transmitter.
[[Image:BistaticAngle.png|thumb|Bistatic radar theory]]

==Passive covert radar==

Human activities generate a great deal of radio energy, as in communications, navigation, and entertainment applications.   Some of these sources provide enough energy such that their reflection or transillumination can enable passive covert radar (PSR) MASINT, which is also called passive coherent location (PCL).

A foreign transmitter, preferably a purpose-built radar transmitter such as used in air traffic control, but really any powerful transmitted such as TV or FM, potentially can produce reflected signals that do not return to the designated receiver of the foreign radar operator. A signal may reflect such that it can be intercepted and fed into a friendly radar receiver, giving at least information on the presence of a radar target illuminated by the foreign transmitter. This is the simple case with the unintended reflection going to a single radar support receiver.

Interferometry is also possible with such systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference

To restate an important difference, basic PCR works with a single radar receiver and conventional display format, from a single reflection. TDOA works with a set of reflections, from the same target, arriving at multiple points.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

This British study tested illumination with a Watchman air traffic control pulse doppler radar, and a Bridgemaster marine radar, against experimental receiver types. The researchers also developed simulations of the system.

Against the marine transmitter, the receiver combined a square-law: Power-level detector with cross-collation of a local copy of the pulse against the received signal.  This method improved sensitivity for poorer time resolution, because correlated peaks are twice the width of uncorrelated peaks.

Using the air traffic control illuminator, the receiver used pulse compression filtering of a chirp signal, which provided processing gain along with the ability to separate closely spaced targets. This also implemented a moving target indicator that suppressed clutter, but it was recognized that an MTI signal would not be available in a noncooperative environment. They concluded their work demonstrated feasible convergence of PCR and TDOA, using a shipborne R-ESM system with communications among the receivers, such that the processed signal is an interferometric process.

[[Walt Mossberg]] and [[Kara Swisher]] founded it in January 2014, after they left [[Dow Jones]] and the similar website they had previously co-founded, ''[[AllThingsD]]''.

In September 2013, technology journalists [[Walt Mossberg]] and [[Kara Swisher]] left [[AllThingsD]], the technology news site they had founded and developed for [[Dow Jones]] and [[News Corp]]. Mossberg left the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' at the end of the year, leaving behind a popular, weekly technology [[newspaper column|column]].&lt;ref name="CNBC: launch" /&gt; The two launched their new, independent technology news website, ''Recode'', on January 2, 2014. Its holding company, Revere Digital, received minority investments from [[NBCUniversal]] and [[Terry Semel]]'s Windsor Media.&lt;ref name="CNBC: launch" /&gt; The total investment was estimated between {{usd|10}} and 15 million. Mossberg and Swisher held the company's majority stake and noted its comfortable financial stance.&lt;ref name="The Verge: launch" /&gt; ''Recode'' also provided breaking technology coverage for NBCUniversal, and received video resources and exposure in return via a formal partnership. Mossberg saw the investment as an opportunity to implement new ways of covering the technology field, and planned to add six employees on technology policy and mobile beats. The CNBC partnership also explored new advertising efforts and shared office space.&lt;ref name="CNBC: launch" /&gt; At launch, the 23-person team included all former members of ''AllThingsD''. The staff also received equity in the company.&lt;ref name="The Verge: launch" /&gt;

Mossberg and Swisher planned to continue their prominent, annual ''AllThingsD'' conference, which they renamed the "Code" conference and scheduled for the same time and location: late May at Terranea Resort in [[Rancho Palos Verdes, California]]. ''Recode'' also kept plans to continue their separate mobile and media conferences. CNBC became a partner in these conferences.&lt;ref name="CNBC: launch" /&gt; A part-time team of 12 employees runs the conferences.&lt;ref name="The Verge: launch" /&gt;

The site developed a reputation for breaking tech industry news but ultimately did not reach the level of popularity it expected, with just 1.5 million regular monthly visitors. [[Vox Media]] acquired the website in May 2015 in a move that ''[[The New York Times]]'' described as a reflection of tumult in online [[technology journalism]].&lt;ref name="NYT: Vox acq" /&gt; Vox purchased all of the company's stock, but the details of the transaction were not released. At the time of the acquisition, ''Recode'' had 44 employees and three additional employees by contract. They were expected to join Vox. Mossberg and Swisher planned to stay with the website. The two were impressed with Vox Media's audience reach. Vox's technology news website, ''[[The Verge]]'', had eight times the traffic, in comparison. The scopes of the two sites were not expected to overlap with ''Recode''{{'s}} emphasis on technology industry business and ''The Verge''{{'s}} on "being a new kind of culture publication".&lt;ref name="NYT: Vox acq" /&gt; An internal study found a three percent overlap in content between the two sites.&lt;ref name="NYT: Vox acq" /&gt; Recode started publishing podcasts in July 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.recode.net/2015/7/8/11614552/hey-serial-lady-shove-over-recode-decode-podcast-debuts-with-slack |title=Hey 'Serial' Lady, Shove Over: Re/code Decode Podcast Debuts With Slack CEO Interview and More! |last=Swisher |first=Kara |date=July 8, 2015 |website=Recode|access-date=August 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 8, 2016, Recode relaunched with a new design under editor-in-chief Dan Frommer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.recode.net/2016/5/8/11617328/introducing-the-new-recode |title=Introducing the new Recode |website=Recode}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Reflecting instruments''' are those that use [[mirror]]s to enhance their ability to make measurements. In particular, the use of mirrors permits one to observe two objects simultaneously while measuring the [[angular distance]] between the objects. While reflecting instruments are used in many professions, they are primarily associated with [[celestial navigation]] as the need to solve navigation problems, in particular the [[Board of Longitude|problem of the longitude]], was the primary motivation in their development.

==Objectives of the instruments==
The purpose of reflecting instruments is to allow an observer to measure the [[altitude]] of a [[celestial object]] or measure the angular distance between two objects.  The driving force behind the developments discussed here was the solution to the problem of finding one's [[Board of Longitude|longitude]] at sea.  The solution to this problem was seen to require an accurate means of measuring angles and the accuracy was seen to rely on the observer's ability to measure this angle by simultaneously observing two objects at once.

The deficiency of prior instruments was well known.  Requiring the observer to observe two objects with two divergent lines of sight increased the likelihood of an error.  Those that considered the problem realized that the use of [[speculum metal|specula]] (mirrors in modern parlance) could permit two objects to be observed in a single view.  What followed is a series of inventions and improvements that refined the instrument to the point that its accuracy exceeded that which was required for determining longitude.  Any further improvements required a completely new technology.

==Early reflecting instruments==
Some of the early reflecting instruments were proposed by scientists such as [[Robert Hooke]] and [[Isaac Newton]].  These were little used or may not have been built or tested extensively.  The van Breen instrument was the exception, in that it was used by the Dutch.  However, it had little influence outside of the [[Netherlands]].

===Joost van Breen's reflecting cross-staff===
Invented in 1660 by the Dutch Joost van Breen, the '''spiegelboog''' (mirror-bow) was a reflecting [[cross staff]].  This instrument appears to have been used for approximately 100 years, mainly in the Zeeland Chamber of the VOC (The [[Dutch East India Company]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dehilster.info/instrumenten/spiegelboog/sis_article_spiegelboog.pdf  De Hilster, N., ''The Spiegelboog (mirror-staff): a reconstruction'', Bulletin of the Scientific Instrument Society, No. 90,  2006].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Robert Hooke's single-reflecting instrument===
[[File:Hooke's reflecting instrument.jpg|thumb|300px|Representative drawing of Hooke's reflecting instrument. It does not accurately depict the fine details of the instrument but rather the basic functionality.&lt;br&gt;The index with telescope mounted is shown in black, the radius arm with the mirror (grey) attached in blue and the chord in green on white. The lines of sight are represented by the red dashed line.]]
Hooke's instrument was a single-reflecting instrument.  It used a single mirror to reflect the image of an [[astronomical object]] to the observer's eye.&lt;ref name="Cotter"&gt;Charles H. Cotter ''The Mariner's Sextant and the Royal Society; Notes and Records of the Royal Society of London'', Vol. 33, No. 1 (Aug., 1978), pp. 23–36.&lt;/ref&gt;  This instrument was first described in 1666 and a working model was presented by Hooke at a meeting of the Royal Society some time later.

The device consisted of three primary components, an index arm, a radial arm and a [[graduation (instrument)|graduated]] chord.  The three were arranged in a triangle as in the image on the right.  A telescopic sight was mounted on the index arm.  At the point of rotation of the radial arm, a single mirror was mounted.  This point of rotation allowed the angle between the index arm and the radial arm to be changed.  The graduated chord was connected to the opposite end of the radial arm and the chord was permitted to rotate about the end.  The chord was held against the distant end of the index arm and slid against it.  The graduations on the chord were uniform and, by using it to measure the distance between the ends of the index arm and the radial arm, the angle between those arms could be determined.  A table of [[Chord (geometry)|chord]]s was used to convert a measurement of distance to a measurement of angle.  The use of the mirror resulted in the measured angle being twice the angle included by the index and the radius arm.

The mirror on the radial arm was small enough that the observer could see the reflection of an object in half the telescope's view while seeing straight ahead in the other half.  This allowed the observer to see both objects at once.  Aligning the two objects together in the telescopes view resulted in the angular distance between them to be represented on the graduated chord.

While Hooke's instrument was novel and attracted some attention at the time, there is no evidence that it was subjected to any tests at sea.&lt;ref name="Cotter"/&gt;  The instrument was little used and did not have any significant effect on astronomy or navigation.

===Halley's reflecting instrument===
[[File:Halley's-instrument.png|thumb|A drawing of Halley's reflecting instrument. The telescope is represented by the blue lines (as if cut open) and the mirrors and lenses are grey. The red dashed lines represent lines of sight.]]

In 1692, [[Edmond Halley]] presented the design of a reflecting instrument to the Royal Society.&lt;ref name="Cotter"/&gt;

This is an interesting instrument, combining the functionality of a [[radio latino]] with a double [[telescope]].  The telescope (AB in the adjacent image), has an eyepiece at one end and a mirror (D) partway along its length with one [[objective lens]] at the far end (B).  The mirror only obstructs half the field (either left or right) and permits the objective to be seen on the other.  Reflected in the mirror is the image from the second objective lens (C).  This permits the observer to see both images, one straight through and one reflected, simultaneously besides each other.  It is essential that the focal lengths of the two objective lenses be the same and that the distances from the mirror to either lens be identical.  If this condition is not met, the two images cannot be brought to a common [[Focus (optics)|focus]].

The mirror is mounted on the staff (DF) of the radio latino portion of the instrument and rotates with it.  The angle  this side of the radio latino's [[rhombus]] makes to the telescope can be set by adjusting the rhombus' diagonal length.  In order to facilitate this and allow for fine adjustment of the angle, a [[screw]] (EC) is mounted so as to allow the observer to change the distance between the two vertexes (E and C).

The observer sights the horizon with the direct lens' view and sights a [[celestial object]] in the mirror.  Turning the screw to bring the two images directly adjacent sets the instrument.  The angle is determined by taking the length of the screw between E and C and converting this to an angle in a table of [[Chord (geometry)|chord]]s.

Halley specified that the telescope tube be rectangular in cross section.  This makes construction easy, but is not a requirement as other cross section shapes can be accommodated.  The four sides of the radio latino portion (CD, DE, EF, FC) must be equal in length in order for the angle between the telescope and the objective lens side (AD-DC) to be precisely twice the angle between the telescope and the mirror (AD-DF) (or in other words – to enforce the [[angle of incidence (optics)|angle of incidence]] being equal to the [[angle of reflection]]).  Otherwise, instrument [[collimation]] will be compromised and the resulting measurements would be in error.

The celestial object's elevation angle could have been determined by reading from graduations on the staff at the slider, however, that's not how Halley designed the instrument.  This may suggest that the overall design of the instrument was coincidentally like a radio latino and that Halley may not have been familiar with that instrument.

There is no knowledge of whether this instrument was ever tested at sea.&lt;ref name="Cotter"/&gt;

===Newton's reflecting quadrant===
{{main article|Octant (instrument)#Newton's_reflecting_quadrant}}
Newton's reflecting quadrant was similar in many respects to Hadley's first reflecting quadrant that followed it.

Newton had communicated the design to [[Edmund Halley]] around 1699.  However, Halley did not do anything with the document and it remained in his papers only to be discovered after his death.&lt;ref name="daumas"&gt;Daumas, Maurice,  ''Scientific Instruments of the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries and Their Makers'', Portman Books, London 1989  {{ISBN|978-0-7134-0727-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, Halley did discuss Newton's design with members of the Royal Society when Hadley presented his reflecting quadrant in 1731.  Halley noted that Hadley's design was quite similar to the earlier Newtonian instrument.&lt;ref name="Cotter" /&gt;

As a result of this inadvertent secrecy, Newton's invention played little role in the development of reflecting instruments.

==The octant==
{{Main article|Octant (instrument)}}

What is remarkable about the octant is the number of persons who independently invented the device in a short period of time.  [[John Hadley]] and [[Thomas Godfrey (inventor)|Thomas Godfrey]] both get credit for inventing the [[octant (instrument)|octant]].  They independently developed the same instrument around 1731.  They were not the only ones, however.

In Hadley's case, two instruments were designed.  The first was an instrument very similar to Newton's reflecting quadrant.  The second had essentially the same form as the modern sextant.  Few of the first design were constructed, while the second became the standard instrument from which the [[sextant]] derived and, along with the sextant, displaced all prior navigation instruments used for [[celestial navigation]].

[[Caleb Smith (astronomer)|Caleb Smith]], an English insurance broker with a strong interest in astronomy, had created an octant in 1734.  He called it an ''Astroscope'' or ''Sea-Quadrant''.&lt;ref name="bedini"&gt;[http://www.profsurv.com/archive.php?issue=17&amp;article=184 Bedini, Silvio,  ''History Corner: Benjamin King of Newport, R.I.-Part II'', Professional Surveyor Magazine, September 1997 Volume 17 Number 6]&lt;/ref&gt; He used a fixed [[Prism (optics)|prism]] in addition to an index mirror to provide reflective elements.  Prisms provide advantages over mirrors in an era when polished [[speculum metal]] mirrors were inferior and both the [[silvering]] of a mirror and the production of glass with flat, parallel surfaces was difficult.  However, the other design elements of Smith's instrument made it inferior to Hadley's octant and it was not used significantly.&lt;ref name="daumas" /&gt;

[[Jean-Paul Fouchy]], a mathematics professor and astronomer in [[France]] invented an octant in 1732.&lt;ref name="daumas" /&gt;  His was essentially the same as Hadley's.  Fouchy did not know of the developments in England at the time, since communications between the two country's instrument makers was limited and the publications of the Royal Society, particularly the ''Philosophical Transactions'', were not being distributed in France.&lt;ref name="fauque"&gt;Fauque, Danielle, ''Un instrument à réflexion pour la marine : deux propositions successives de Fouchy'', presented at Colloque Grandjean de Fouchy, March 23, 2007 at the Observatoire de Paris.&lt;/ref&gt;  Fouchy's octant was overshadowed by Hadley's.

==The sextant==
:''The main article, [[Sextant]], covers the use of the instrument in navigation.  This article concentrates on the history and the development of the instrument''
[[File:Experienced sextant.jpg|thumb|A sextant that has been used for over a half century. This frame shows one standard design – that with three rings. This is one design that has been used to avoid thermal expansion problems while retaining adequate stiffness.]]
The origin of the sextant is straightforward and not in dispute.  [[John Campbell (governor)|Admiral John Campbell]], having used Hadley's octant in sea trials of the [[method of lunar distances]], found that it was wanting.  The 90° angle [[subtend]]ed by the arc of the instrument was insufficient to measure some of the angular distances required for the method.  He suggested that the angle be increased to 120°, yielding the sextant.  [[John Bird (astronomer)|John Bird]] made the first such sextant in 1757.&lt;ref name="turner"/&gt;

With the development of the sextant, the octant became something of a second class instrument.  The octant, while occasionally constructed entirely of brass, remained primarily a wooden-framed instrument.  Most of the developments in advanced materials and construction techniques were reserved for the sextant.

There are examples of sextants made with wood, however most are made from brass.  In order to ensure the frame was stiff, instrument makers used  thicker frames.  This had a drawback in making the instrument heavier, which could influence the accuracy due to hand-shaking as the navigator worked against its weight.  In order to avoid this problem, the frames were modified.  [[Edward Troughton]] patented the double-framed sextant in 1788.&lt;ref name="turnerASI"&gt;Turner, Gerard L'E., ''Antique Scientific Instruments'', Blandford Press Ltd. 1980 {{ISBN|0-7137-1068-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This used two frames held in parallel with spacers.  The two frames were about a centimetre apart.  This significantly increased the stiffness of the frame.  An earlier version had a second frame that only covered the upper part of the instrument, securing the mirrors and telescope.  Later versions used two full frames.  Since the spacers looked like little pillars, these were also called ''pillar sextants''.
 
Troughton also experimented with alternative materials.  The scales were [[plated]] with [[silver]], [[gold]] or [[platinum]].  Gold and platinum both minimized [[corrosion]] problems.  The platinum-plated instruments were expensive, due to the scarcity of the metal, though less expensive than gold.  Troughton knew [[William Hyde Wollaston]] through the Royal Society and this gave him access to the precious metal.&lt;ref name="chaldecott"&gt;Chaldecott, John A., ''Platinum and Palladium in Astronomy and Navigation: The Pioneer Work of Edward Troughton and William Hyde Wollaston'', Platinum Metals Review, Volume 31  Issue 2  April 1987   Pages 91–100 [http://www.platinummetalsreview.com/pdf/pmr-v31-i2-091-100.pdf Online version (pdf)]&lt;/ref&gt;  Instruments from Troughton's company that used platinum can be easily identified by the word ''Platina'' engraved on the frame.  These instruments remain highly valued as collector's items and are as accurate today as when they were constructed.&lt;ref name="catalog"&gt;Catalog 130, Spring 1987, Historical Technology Inc, Marblehead MA, USA&lt;/ref&gt;

As the developments in [[dividing engine]]s progressed, the sextant was more accurate and could be made smaller.  In order to permit easy reading of the [[Vernier scale|vernier]], a small magnifying lens was added.  In addition, to reduce glare on the frame, some had a [[Diffuser (optics)|diffuser]] surrounding the magnifier to soften the light.  As accuracy increased, the circular arc vernier was replaced with a drum vernier.

Frame designs were modified over time to create a frame that would not be adversely affected by temperature changes.  These frame patterns became standardized and one can see the same general shape in many instruments from many different manufacturers.

In order to control costs, modern sextants are now available in precision-made plastic.  These are light, affordable and of high quality.

==Types of sextants==

While most people think of navigation when they hear the term ''sextant'', the instrument has been used in other professions.

;Navigator's sextant:The common type of instrument most people think of when they hear the term ''sextant''.
;Sounding sextants:These are sextants that were constructed for use horizontally rather than vertically and were developed for use in [[hydrographic survey]]s.&lt;ref name="turner"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Turner|first1=Gerald L E|title=Nineteenth Century Scientific Instruments|date=1983|publisher=Sotheby Publications|isbn=0-85667-170-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
;Surveyor's sextants:These were constructed for use exclusively on land for horizontal angular measurements.  Instead of a handle on the frame, they had a socket to allow the attachment of a surveyor's [[Jacob's staff]].
;Box or pocket sextants:These are small sextants entirely contained within a metal case.  First developed by Edward Troughton, they are usually all brass with most of the mechanical components inside the case.  The telescope extends from an opening in the side.  The index and other parts are completely covered when the case cover is slipped on.  Popular with surveyors for their small size (typically only 6.5–8&amp;nbsp;cm in diameter and 5&amp;nbsp;cm deep), their accuracy was enabled by improvements in the [[dividing engine]]s used to graduate the arcs.  The arcs are so small that magnifiers are attached to allow them to be read.&lt;ref name="turnerASI"/&gt;

In addition to these types, there are terms used for various sextants.

A ''pillar sextant'' can be either:
#A double-frame sextant as patented by Edward Troughton in 1788.
#A surveyor's sextant with a socket for a surveyor's staff (the pillar).&lt;ref&gt;''Tesseract – Early Scientific Instruments'', Volume Fifteen, Winter 1987.  Catalogue entry for an "Adams Pillar Octant", a single frame octant used for surveying.  It was made in London circa 1800. The photographs show the socket used for Jacob's staff.&lt;/ref&gt;
The former is the most common use of the term.

==Beyond the sextant==

===Quintant and others===

Several makers offered instruments with sizes other than one-eighth or one-sixth of a circle.  One of the most common was the ''quintant'' or fifth of a circle (72° arc reading to 144°).  Other sizes were also available, but the odd sizes never became common.  Many instruments are found with scales reading to, for example, 135°, but they are simply referred to as sextants.  Similarly, there are 100° octants, but these are not separated as unique types of instruments.

There was interest in much larger instruments for special purposes.  In particular a number of full circle instruments were made, categorized as reflecting circles and [[repeating circle]]s.

&lt;span id="reflecting circle"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

===Reflecting circles===
[[File:Cercle de reflexion img 2600.jpg|thumb|Borda's reflecting circle, on display at Toulon naval museum]]
[[File:Cercle de Mendoça IMG 8791-black.jpg|thumb|Mendoça's reflecting circle on display at the [[Musée national de la Marine]].]]

The reflecting circle was invented by the [[Germany|German]] [[geometer]] and [[astronomer]] [[Tobias Mayer]] in 1752,&lt;ref name="turner" /&gt; with details published in 1767.&lt;ref name="daumas" /&gt;  His development preceded the sextant and was motivated by the need to create a superior surveying instrument.&lt;ref name="daumas" /&gt;

The reflecting circle is a complete circular instrument graduated to 720° (To measure distances between heavenly bodies, there is no need to read an angle greater than 180°, since the minimum distance will always be less than 180°.).  Mayer presented a detailed description of this instrument to the [[Board of Longitude]] and John Bird used the information to construct one sixteen inches in diameter for evaluation by the Royal Navy.&lt;ref name="may"&gt;May, William Edward, ''A History of Marine Navigation'', G. T. Foulis &amp;amp; Co. Ltd., Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire, 1973, {{ISBN|0-85429-143-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This instrument was one of those used by [[John Campbell (governor)|Admiral John Campbell]] during his evaluation of the [[lunar distance method]].   It differed in that it was graduated to 360° and was so heavy that it was fitted with a support that attached to a belt.&lt;ref name="may"/&gt;  It was not considered better than the Hadley octant and was less convenient to use.&lt;ref name="daumas" /&gt;  As a result, Campbell recommended the construction of the sextant.

[[Jean-Charles de Borda]] further developed the reflecting circle.  He modified the position of the telescopic sight in such a way that the mirror could be used to receive an image from either side relative to the telescope.  This eliminated the need to ascertain that the mirrors were precisely parallel when reading zero.  This simplified the use of the instrument.  Further refinements were performed with the help of [[Etienne Lenoir (instrument maker)|Etienne Lenoir]].  The two of them refined the instrument to its definitive form in 1777.&lt;ref name="daumas"/&gt;  This instrument was so distinctive it was given the name ''Borda circle''.&lt;ref name="turner" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The building of such an instrument was somewhat complicated by the strict claims of the various French guilds; the metallic portion was entrusted to the foundry guild, the lenses and mirrors to the glassmakers guild – but in 1788, [[Dominique, comte de Cassini]] established a new guild of astronomical instrument makers, with Lenoir among the first members. Paul Murdin, ''The Revolution and the Meter'' (2009, NY, Springer) pages 92–95.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Josef de Mendoza y Ríos]] redesigned Borda's reflecting circle (London, 1801). The goal was to use it together with his Lunar Tables published by the [[Royal Society]] (London, 1805). He made a design with two concentric circles and a [[vernier scale]] and recommended averaging three sequential readings to reduce the error. Borda's system was not based on a circle of 360° but 400 [[Grad (angle)|grads]] (Borda spent years calculating his tables with a circle divided in 400°). Mendoza's lunar tables have been used through almost the entire nineteenth century (see [[Lunar distance (navigation)]]).

Edward Troughton also modified the reflecting circle.  He created a design with three index arms and [[vernier scale|vernier]]s.  This permitted three simultaneous readings to average out the error.

As a navigation instrument, the reflecting circle was more popular with the French navy than with the British.&lt;ref name="turner" /&gt;

One instrument derived from the reflecting circle is the '''[[repeating circle]]'''. Invented by Lenoir in 1784,&lt;ref name="daumas"/&gt; Borda and Lenoir developed the instrument for [[geodetic surveying]].  Since it was not used for the celestial measures, it did not use double reflection and substituted two telescope sights.  As such, it was not a reflecting instrument.  It was notable as being the equal of the great [[theodolite]] created by the renowned instrument maker, [[Jesse Ramsden]].

===Bris sextant===
{{main article|Bris sextant}}
The '''Bris sextant''' is not a true sextant, but it is a true reflecting instrument based on the principle of double reflection and subject to the same rules and errors as common octants and sextants. Unlike common octants and sextants, the '''Bris sextant''' is a fixed angle instrument capable of accurately measuring a few specific angles unlike other reflecting instruments which can measure any angle within the range of the instrument.  It is particularly suited to determining the altitude of the [[sun]] or [[moon]].

===Surveying sector===
[[Francis Ronalds]] invented an instrument for recording angles in 1829 by modifying the octant. A disadvantage of reflecting instruments in [[surveying]] applications is that [[optics]] dictate that the mirror and index arm rotate through half the angular separation of the two objects. The angle thus needs to be read, noted and a [[protractor]] employed to draw the angle on a plan. Ronalds’ idea was to configure the index arm to rotate through twice the angle of the mirror, so that the arm could then be used to draw a line at the correct angle directly onto the drawing. He used a [[Sector (instrument)|sector]] as the basis of his instrument and placed the horizon glass at one tip and the index mirror near the hinge connecting the two rulers. The two revolving elements were linked mechanically and the barrel supporting the mirror was twice the diameter of the hinge to give the required angular ratio.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sir Francis Ronalds: Father of the Electric Telegraph|last=Ronalds|first=B.F.|publisher=[[Imperial College Press]]|year=2016|isbn=978-1-78326-917-4|location=London|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21018">A '''smart toy''' is a [[toy]] which effectively has its own intelligence by virtue of on-board electronics. These enable it to learn, behave according to pattern, and alter its actions depending upon environmental stimuli. Typically, it can adjust to the abilities of the player. A modern smart toy has electronics consisting of one or more [[microprocessor]]s or [[microcontroller]]s, [[Volatile memory|volatile]] and/or [[non-volatile memory]], [[Data storage device|storage devices]], and various forms of [[Input/output|input–output devices]].&lt;ref name=developing&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.intel.com/technology/itj/archive/2001.htm|title=Developing Smart Toys--From Idea To Product|first=Scott|last=Boss|publisher=Intel Technology Journal|date=November 2001|accessdate=2007-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It may be [[Computer network|networked]] together with other smart toys or a [[personal computer]] in order to enhance its [[play value]] or educational features.&lt;ref name=zowie&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/features/gdcarchive/2000/shwe.doc|title=Smarter Play for Smart Toys:  The Benefits of Technology-Enhanced Play|first=Helen|last=Shwe|publisher=Zowie Intertainment, Inc.|year=1999|accessdate=2007-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=QX3&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.intel.com/technology/itj/archive/2001.htm|title=Dissection of the Intel Play QX3 Computer Microscope|first=Lenka|last=Jelinek|publisher=Intel Technology Journal|date=November 2001|accessdate=2007-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Generally, the smart toy may be controlled by [[Computer software|software]] which is embedded in [[firmware]] or else loaded from an input device such as a [[USB flash drive]], [[Memory Stick]] or [[CD-ROM]].&lt;ref name=Engineer&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.graduatingengineer.com/articles/feature/07-28-00.html|title=Engineers and computer scientists are turning their passion for play into exciting careers at toy companies|first=Paula|last=Lipp|publisher=Graduate Engineer &amp; Computer Careers Online|date=July 28, 2000|accessdate=2007-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smart toys frequently have extensive [[multimedia]] capabilities, and these can be utilized to produce a realistic, animated, simulated personality for the toy.  Some commercial examples of smart toys are ''Amazing Amanda'', [[Furby]] and [[iDog]].&lt;ref name=list&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kei.ki/en/List_of_smart_toys|title= List of smart toys|publisher=keiki: The Free Parenting Guide|accessdate=2007-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Common confusions ==

Smart toys are frequently confused with toys for which it is claimed that children who play with them become smarter.  Examples are [[educational toy]]s that may or may not provide on-board intelligence features.&lt;ref name=family&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scholastic.com/familymatters/rightstuff/smarttoys.htm|title= Making Smart Choices on Electronic Learning|publisher=Scholastic|accessdate=2007-11-04 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070807122055/http://www.scholastic.com/familymatters/rightstuff/smarttoys.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A toy which merely contains a [[Media player (application software)|media player]] for telling the child a story should not be classified as a smart toy even if the player contains its own microprocessor.  What best distinguishes a smart toy is the way the on-board intelligence is  [[Holism|holistically]] integrated into the play experience in order to create [[Simulation|simulated]] human-like intelligence or its facsimile.&lt;ref name=AI&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aboutai.net/DesktopDefault.aspx?tabindex=1&amp;tabid=2&amp;article=aa091300a.htm|title=Smart Toys|publisher=All About Artificial Intelligence On the Net|date=September 13, 2000|accessdate=2007-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

Modern smart toys have their early roots in [[clockwork]]s such as those of the eighteenth and nineteenth century [[cuckoo clock]]s, [[Musical box|music boxes]] of the nineteenth, and Disney [[audio-animatronics]] of the twentieth.  Perhaps the biggest early contribution is from novelty and toy makers from the 1800s who made [[automaton]]s such as [[Jacques de Vaucanson|Vaucanson's]] [[Digesting Duck|mechanical duck]], [[Wolfgang von Kempelen|von Kempelen's]] [[The Turk]], and the [[Silver Swan (automaton)|Silver Swan]]. All pre-twentieth-century precursors had in common that they were mechanical contrivances.  By the second half of the 1900s toys featuring built-in media players became common.  For example, Mattel introduced a variety of dolls in the 1960s and 1970s that used a pull string activated talking device to make the dolls "talk" such as the [[Crissy Doll|talking Crissy doll]] and [[Chatty Cathy]].

However, it remained until the introduction of the microprocessor in the mid-1970s for smart toys to come into their own. Texas Instrument's [[Speak &amp; Spell (toy)|Speak &amp; Spell]] which came on the market in the late 1970s was one of the first full-featured smart toys.  The device is similar to a very limited laptop with LED read-out.  It is used for spelling games and guessing a "mystery code". It speaks and makes a variety of sound effects.  Another early example is [[Teddy Ruxpin]], a robotic teddy bear which came out in the 1980s.  It reads children's stories via a recording device built into its back and swivels its eyes and mouth.

Even the earliest toys, from the nineteenth century on, have in common with their modern-day smart toy counterparts that they appear to be sentient and lifelike, at least to the extent possible using the technology available at the time.  Contemporary smart toys utilize [[speech recognition]] and [[Voice command device|activation]]; that is, they appear to comprehend and react to words that are spoken.&lt;ref name=surveying&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.4c.ucc.ie/web/upload/publications/mastersThesis/Artificial_Intelligence_in_Business.pdf|format=PDF|title=AI Surveying: Artificial Intelligence In Business|first=Tomas Eric|last=Nordlander|publisher=(MS Thesis), De Montfort University|year=2001|accessdate=2007-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Through [[speech synthesis]], smart toys speak prerecorded words and phrases. These kinds of technologies, when combined together, animate the toys and give them a lifelike [[persona]].&lt;ref name=talk&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edn.com/article/CA56245.html|title=Designing Toys that Talk-No Child's Play|first=Erik|last=Soule|publisher=Electronics Design, Strategy, News|date=December 12, 2000|accessdate=2007-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sidney&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/icon/smart-toys/2005/11/30/1133311090876.html|title=Smart Toys|first=Jano|last=Gibson|publisher=The Sidney Morning Herald|date=December 3, 2005|accessdate=2007-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another hardware feature of modern smart toys is [[sensor]]s which enable the smart toy to be aware of what is going on in its environment.  These permit the toy to tell its orientation, determine if it is being played with indoors or outdoors, and know who is playing with it based upon the strength of the squeeze the child's hand gives it or similar factors.
A typical example is [[Lego Mindstorms]], a series of robotic-like devices, which integrate LEGO pieces with sensors and accessories.  These toys include microcontrollers which control the [[robot]]s. They are pre-programmed by a personal computer and utilize light and touch sensors along with [[accelerometer]]s. Accelerometers and temperature, pressure and humidity sensors, can also be used to create various effects by smart toy designers.&lt;ref name=small&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smalltimes.com/Articles/Article_Display.cfm?ARTICLE_ID=267533&amp;p=109|title=Smart Toys Will Break Cost Barrier In Two To Five Years, Analysts Say|first=Tom|last=Henderson|publisher=Small Times|date=July 2, 2001|accessdate=2007-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of smart toys received a major boost in 1998 when semiconductor manufacturer, Intel, and toy maker, Mattel, Inc. entered into a joint venture to open a ''Smart Toy Lab'' in Portland, Oregon.  This led to products that were marketed under the [[Intel Play]] brand. The first product in the line was the ''QX3 Computer Microscope''. The Lab evolved into a toy company known today as Digital Blue, a division of Prime Entertainment, Inc. of Marietta, GA.&lt;ref name=lab&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.intel.com/technology/itj/archive/2001.htm|title=History of the Smart Toy Lab and Intel Play Toys|first=Herman|last=D'Hooge|publisher=Intel Technology Journal|date=November 2001|accessdate=2007-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversies ==

Widespread commercialization of smart toys is mainly a 21st-century phenomenon.  As they have gained acceptance in the marketplace, controversy has been brewing.  One of the chief criticisms has been that despite often being technical marvels, many smart toys have only limited play value.&lt;ref name=software&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.childrenssoftware.com/gettingsmart.html|title=Getting Smart on Smart Toys: Ten Tips for Spotting The Winners and Losers|publisher=Children's Software Review (Renamed Children's Technology Review)|date=June–July 2001|accessdate=2007-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In short, these toys neither involve the child in [[play (activity)|play activity]] nor do they stimulate his or her imagination.&lt;ref name=interact&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paccit.org/public/Publications/IEEE%20Computer.pdf|format=PDF|title=Interactivity, Interface, and Smart Toys|first=Lydia|last=Plowman|publisher=Computer (IEEE)|date=February 2004|accessdate=2007-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Consequently, regardless of store-shelf attractiveness, the child tires quickly of them after only one or two play sessions, and the parents' investment is largely wasted.&lt;ref name=problem&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/26/health/26toys.html|title=The Problem With Some 'Smart' Toys: (Hint) Use Your Imagination|first=Linda|last=Carroll|publisher=The New York Times|date=October 26, 2004|accessdate=2007-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Stevanne Auerbach]], in her book ''Smart Play—Smart Toys'' introduces the notion of ''Play Quotient'' or simply ''PQ''.

Auerbach criticizes smart toys for often having low PQs.  PQ is a rating system based upon a [[Weighted mean|weighted average]] constructed from a comprehensive list of ''play value'' attributes.  Playthings with higher PQs are desirable from the standpoint of stimulating the child's imagination, creativity, and inquisitiveness.  Generally, children choose to play with these products over and over again.  Those toys with low PQs are quickly set aside.  The child finds them boring and uninteresting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= |title=Dr. Toy's Smart Play Smart Toys (How To Raise A Child With a High PQ (Play Quotient)) |publisher=Stevanne Auerbach |year=2004 |isbn=0-9785540-0-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many [[child development]] experts prefer open-ended toys such as [[Construction set|construction toys]], [[Toy block|blocks]], [[doll]]s, etc. over smart toys.
For example, a cardboard box that the child turns into a pretend play house will be played with continuously by the child for many hours whereas an expensive smart toy can quickly exhaust the child's interest once its novelty has worn off.&lt;ref name=not&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kei.ki/en/Toddler_play|title=Smart Toys: Smart or Not|publisher=keiki: The Free Parenting Guide|accessdate=2007-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jillian Trezise typifies the attitude often taken by child development specialists and educators towards smart toys, "...if kids can't take their expensive toys to the sandpit or open them up to see how they work, then they don't provide much educational value. All they do is entertain and they don't hold young people's attention for very long."

Another implicit concern about smart toys is that even when they hold the child's attention they could become so entertaining that parents may be tempted to turn over some of the child-rearing to the smart toys. Thus, children will be deprived of needed parental attention.  In other words, because of their strong multimedia capabilities children may watch presentations provided by the smart toys and be entertained, but will not really play with the devices nor be otherwise engaged by them.

Judy Shackelford, a toy industry veteran, has a more positive view regarding smart toys. She cautions that children may even be deprived should they be not exposed to them. She sees smart toys as part of the surrounding environment that children will need to adapt to as they mature. Should they not be given access to these kinds of toys, they may become less well adapted to thrive and benefit as technology evolves.

Smart toy advocates also point to research indicating that children learn more effectively with good interactive software. This seems to support the idea that smart toys may have many educational benefits as well.&lt;ref&gt;Gibson, op. cit.&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been increasing concerns that smart toys, especially ones that directly connect to the Internet, are becoming easy targets for [[cybercriminal]]s, who can use hacking to easily obtain personal data collected from a smart toy, especially personal names.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/internet-of-things-connected-smart-toys-rsa-security-conference/|title="Playtime is over: Can smart toys ever be safe?"|publisher=[[Cnet]]|date=2016-02-26|accessdate=2016-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stevens|first1=Gina|title=Smart Toys and the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998|date=January 8, 2018|publisher=Congressional Research Service|location=Washington, DC|url=https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/LSB10051.pdf|accessdate=27 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.top10vpn.com/privacy-central/privacy/smart-toys-safety-review/|title=Spies Under the Tree: This Season’s Most Vulnerable Smart Toys|publisher=Top10VPN|date=2017-12-07|accessdate=2018-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Industry ==

Market research company, GfK Australia, found that parents are spending record amounts on electronic and interactive toys.&lt;ref&gt;Gibson, op. cit.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mark Allen states that the greatest impediment to the further growth of the smart toy industry is the lack of development of [[artificial intelligence]] and [[speech recognition]].  At their present stage of evolution smart toys really can't learn so they are limited to predefined actions and speech.  Present artificial intelligence capabilities are too expensive to implement in a toy, but this will change as computational power and speed come down in price.  Eventually, this will result in cheaper technology, enhanced functionality, and a richer play experience. Some toy designers think it could be five years or more before the technology is cheap enough to be widely available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Toys, Games, and Media|last=Goldstein (Ed.)|first=Jeffrey|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum|date=July 2004|isbn=0-8058-4903-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others have cited the high cost of [[Microelectromechanical systems|MEMS]]-based sensors and actuators as a factor constraining the rapid development of smart toys. These costs are expected to come down eventually also, thereby helping toy companies to hit their price targets.&lt;ref&gt;Henderson, op. cit.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to figures from the NPD Group, at the end of 1999, the smart toy segment made up 2.5 percent of the $23 billion toy market.&lt;ref name=ages&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.zdnet.co.uk/itmanagement/0,1000000308,2080296,00.htm|title='Smart' tech toys for kids of all ages|first=Richard|last=Shim|publisher=ZDNet.co.uk|date=July 20, 2000|accessdate=2007-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The smart toy industry grew out of several other product categories, which include children's software, electronic toys, and video games. A 2001 Forrester Research study projected that the smart toy segment would grow to more than $2 billion by the year 2003. Factors enhancing the growth of the smart toy segment include the greatly more sophisticated tastes of children today as well as the spread of home PCs.&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein, op. cit.&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2005 market research study by Tangull America LLC of New York, NY indicated that toys with embedded information technologies—that is, nano, bio and cognitive technologies—are growing over 15% annually, and will grow to sales of US $146 billion by 2015. As an example, one of the "smart toys" the study cites are "interactive puppets" that become "real playmates" through the combination of artificial intelligence and ultrafine sensors.  The latter can measure changes in facial expressions, movements, and environment and the puppets react accordingly.&lt;ref name=nano&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nanovip.com/node/1843|title=Nano Toys and Smart Toys will soar to US$ 146 billion up to 2015|publisher=NANOVIP.com|date=September 27, 2005|accessdate=2007-11-05 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080304161028/http://www.nanovip.com/node/1843 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Selection criteria ==

The issue of balance is often mentioned in connection with smart toys—namely, that their use should be kept in proportion with other play activities. They should also be age appropriate and not become a substitute for interaction with parents.  Playing with smart toys should be a supplement, not a replacement, for traditional play activities.&lt;ref name=early&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.earlylearningcentre.com.au/Store/members/parent009.aspx|title=Development &amp; play|first=Cathrine|last=Neilsen-Hewett|publisher=Early Learning Centre|accessdate=2007-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=goodtoy&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.authorsden.com/visit/viewarticle.asp?AuthorID=461|title=What Makes A Good Toy|first=Stevanne|last=Auerbach|publisher=AuthorsDen.com|date=July 23, 2000|accessdate=2007-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stevanne Auerbach emphasizes smart toys which have strong ''play value'' for the child, and are the "right toy at the right time." She does not favor those toys which fail to encourage discovery and exploration.  Auerbach quips that "a toy playing with a child, as opposed to a child playing with a toy, is not beneficial for the child.&lt;ref&gt;Gibson, op. cit.&lt;/ref&gt;

Those toys that give the child control over interaction are best according to some child development researchers. Kiely Gouley argues that "...some of these toys are very entertaining and they make the child a passive observer." She continues: "...you want the child to engage with the world. If the toy does everything if it sings and beeps and shows pictures, what does the child have to do?"

Smart toys should have very clean, easy-to-understand and navigate [[user interface]]s.  Claire Lerner, a child-development specialist, says that pretend play can be inhibited by highly structured toys: "They superimpose someone else's story on the kids. So kids don't develop their imaginations." In her view, simpler toys are preferable, because they are more flexible.&lt;ref&gt;Carroll, op. cit.&lt;/ref&gt;

From a designer of smart toy's viewpoint, this means that in order to achieve simplicity technologies need to be combined so as to render a very naturalistic user interface within the limits of other design constraints.

Children by nature are unpredictable and often fail to follow the same rules followed by adults. One of the tasks of the designer is to anticipate ways that interaction with children can fail to be as expected and to guide the user into one of the expected responses. This can be achieved by giving the child options to select and other types of cues to follow.

For parents and child development specialists alike, the task remains to select the right toys at the right time.  However, from the toy designer's standpoint, the challenge is to identify the best technologies at a feasible cost, and then to develop products around those capabilities and limitations of the technologies used in smart toys.&lt;ref name=analog&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.planetanalog.com/story/OEG20001201S0069|title=Smart toys pose design challenge|first=Jeff|last=Rogers|publisher=Planet Analog|date=December 1, 2000|accessdate=2007-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anthropologist David Lancy argues that parent-child play is largely an artifact of wealthy developed countries not practiced by most of the world's population.  It results from competitive pressures to ready children for survival in an information-based economy. He views the promotion of interaction between parents and children in "play activities" as a form of cultural imperialism practiced by the upper and upper middle class upon lower income socioeconomic strata.  This is possibly one reservation on a completely unrestricted view that parents should always be involved in selecting appropriate smart toys for their children.&lt;ref name=alone&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boston.com/news/globe/ideas/articles/2007/07/15/leave_those_kids_alone/?page=1|title=Leave those kids alone|first=Christopher|last=Shea|publisher=The Boston Globe|date=July 15, 2007|accessdate=2007-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10912">A '''talking clock''' (also called a '''speaking clock''' and an '''auditory clock''') is a timekeeping device that presents the time as sounds. It may present the time solely as sounds, such as a phone-based time service (see "[[Speaking clock]]") or a clock for the hearing impaired, or may have a sound feature in addition to an analog or digital face.

== History ==
Although they would not be considered to be speaking, clocks have incorporated noisemakers such as clangs, chimes, gongs, melodies, and the sounds of cuckoos or roosters from almost the beginning of the mechanical clock. Soon after [[Thomas Edison]]'s invention of the phonograph, the earliest attempts to make a clock that incorporated a voice were made. Around 1878, Frank Lambert invented a machine that used a voice recorded on a lead cylinder to call out the hours. Lambert used lead in place of Edison's soft tinfoil. In 1992, the Guinness Book of World Records recognized this as the oldest known sound recording that was playable&lt;ref&gt;Aaron Cramer with Allen Koenigsberg [http://www.collectorcafe.com/article_archive.asp?article=670&amp;id=1503] The World’s Oldest Recording: Frank Lambert's Amazing Time Machine – Part 2 (Retrieved on February 2, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; (though that status now rests with a [[Phonautograph|phonautogram]] of [[Leon Scott|Édouard-Léon Scott de Martinville]], recorded in 1857). It is on display at the National Watch and Clock Museum in [[Columbia, Pennsylvania|Columbia]], [[Pennsylvania]].

Although there have been rumors that other talking clocks may have been produced afterward, it is not until around 1910 that another talking clock was introduced, when Bernhard Hiller created a clock that used a belt with a recording on it to announce the time. However, these belts were often broken by the hand-tightening required, and all attempts to reproduce the celluloid ribbon have so far failed.

In 1933, the first practical use of talking clocks was seen when [[Ernest Esclangon]] created a talking telephone time service in [[Paris, France|Paris]], [[France]]. On its first day, February 14, 1933, more than 140,000 calls were received. London began a similar service three years later. This type of talking time service is still around, and more than a million calls per year are received for the [[NIST]]'s Telephone Time-of-Day Service.&lt;ref&gt;National Institute of Standards and Technology ''NIST Telephone Time-of-Day Service'' [http://tf.nist.gov/timefreq/stations/sig.html] (Retrieved on February 2, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Mattel clock.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The Mattell-a-Time Talking Clock]]

In 1954, Ted Duncan, Inc., released the ''Hickory Dickory Clock'', a crank toy intended for children. This clock used a record, needle, and tone arm to produce its sound.

In 1968, the first truly portable talking clock, the ''Mattel-a-Time'' Talking Clock, was released. 

In 1979 [[Sharp Corporation|Sharp]] released the world first quartz-based talking clock, the ''Talking Time CT-660E'' (German version ''CT-660G''). Its  silver transistor-radio-like case contained complex LSI circuitry with 3 SMD ICs (likely clock CPU, speech CPU and sound IC), producing a [[Speak_&amp;_Spell_(toy)|Speak&amp;Spell]]-like synthetic voice. At the front rim was a small LCD. The alarm spoke the time and also had a melody "Boccherini's Minuet"; after 5 minutes the alarm repeated with the words "Please hurry!". It also had stopwatch and countdown timer modes. The tiny controls to turn off alarm or set functions are hard to reach under a small bottom lid.&lt;ref&gt;Tech Toy Playground -  Sharp Talking Time [http://techtoywizard.blogspot.de/2013/08/sharp-talking-time.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Comparing English and German Sharp Talking Time [https://audioboom.com/boos/2497380-comparing-the-english-and-german-sharp-talking-time-ct-660e-and-ct-660g]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984, the [[Seiko|Hattori Seiko Co.]] released their famous pyramid-shaped talking clock, the ''Pyramid Talk''. As a futuristic design object even its LCD was hidden at the bottom, thus people were supposed to always push its top to hear it talk, which is not very practical.

Current talking clocks often include many more features than just giving the time; in these, the ability to speak the time is part of a wide range of voice capabilities, such as reading the weather and other information to the user.

== Uses and purposes ==

=== Teaching timetelling ===

After the telephone time service, the next practical application of the talking clock was in the teaching of timetelling to children. The first talking clock to be used for this purpose was the Mattel "Mattel-a-Time Talking Clock" of 1968. Several other clocks of this type followed, including one featuring [[Thomas the Tank Engine]]. One of the latest ones, the "Talking Clever Clock", includes a quiz button which asks questions such as "What time is it?", "What time will it be in an hour?", and "How much time has passed between 1:00 and 2:30?" Other educational talking clocks come in a kit designed to be assembled by children.

Talking clocks can also be used with children whose learning disabilities may be partially offset by the reinforcement provided by hearing the time as well as seeing it.

=== Assisting the blind===

[[Image:Cube clock.jpg|thumb|left|175px|The Cube Clock, a talking clock designed specifically for blind and visually-impaired users. {{audio|Blue_cube_clock.ogg|listen}}]]

Talking clocks have found a natural home as an [[assistive technology]] for people who are blind or visually impaired. There are over 150 tabletop clocks and 50 types of watches that talk. Manufacturers of such clocks include Sharp, [[Panasonic]], [[RadioShack]], and [[Reizen]].  In addition, one manufacturer purportedly produced a clock that would announce the time upon detecting a user's whistling signal.{{cn|date=November 2016}}

=== Branding/Advertising ===

Many companies have used talking clocks as a novelty item to promote their brand. In 1987, the [[H. J. Heinz Company]] released a clock with the figure of "Mr. Aristocrat", a tomato with a motif similar to [[Mr. Peanut]]. At alarm time, the clock said, "It's time to get up; get up right away! Wait any longer and it's 'ketchup' all day! Remember, Heinz is the thick rich one." At roughly the same time, [[Pillsbury Company|Pillsbury]] created a similar clock with the character of Little Sprout. In recent years, the Coca-Cola polar bear, the Red and Yellow M&amp;M's characters, the Pillsbury Doughboy, a Campbell's Soup girl, and others have at one time appeared on a talking clock. One of the more interesting branded clocks was produced by [[Energizer]] and was a soft, battery-shaped clock whose alarm was turned off by punching it or throwing it against a hard surface.

=== Entertainment/conversation pieces ===
[[Image:Jesus talking clock.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The Talking Jesus Clock. {{audio|Last_supper_clock.ogg|listen}}]]
The inexpensiveness of modern speech technology has allowed manufacturers to include talking clock capabilities into a wide range of products. Many of these are intended as conversation pieces or speak merely for the entertainment of hearing sounds or words spoken by an inanimate object. Such timepieces include Darth Vader clocks, calculators with time features, and even a painting of [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s [[The Last Supper (Leonardo)|The Last Supper]] that announces the time on the hour along with a quote from Jesus.

Other themes of talking timepieces include fortune-telling, astrology, clocks with moving lips, animated creatures, sports and athletes, and movies, among others.

== Technology ==

Most modern talking clocks are based on speech-synthesis [[integrated circuits]] that generate speech from sampled, stored data. The rapid technological progress of the 1980s enabled today's high-quality talking products. Early talking clocks employed chips that linked phonemes to generate speech.  These products could generate unlimited speech, but it was of relatively poor quality that sounded robotic, at worst, unintelligible. Today's higher-quality speech is produced by sampled-data systems that take elements of an actual human voice. Modern voice synthesis technologies can produce synthesized vocabularies that retain the style of the speaker exactly and are not limited to just perfect English, but can be as varied as Scottish accents, Japanese, and even the voice of a young child. Such voices are all generated using tiny, inexpensive voice chips that are readily available. 

Almost all of the latest voice-chipped talking clocks incorporate the female human voice to announce the time. Dr. Mark McKinley, the president of the International Society of Talking Clock Collectors, proposes three possible explanations for this phenomenon. The female voice may be considered more soothing psychologically; it may be a relic of the female voice being historically associated with secretarial (Administrative Assistant) functions; or a feminine voice may possibly simply be softer in a less intrusive way.&lt;ref&gt;McKinley, Mark B. ''The Collected History and Significance of Talking Clocks'' [[NAWCC]] Bulletin June 2004;46:331-8&lt;/ref&gt;

Many talking clocks include a light sensor or a setting that will automatically silence them between certain hours (usually between 10 p.m. and 8 a.m.).

=== Ozen Box ===
[[Image:Ozen box 2.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Ozen box layout.]]
[[Image:Ozen box 1.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Ozen box inside Superman talking clock. {{audio|Superman_clock.ogg|listen}}]]

Many talking clocks of the 1970s utilized an Ozen box, which is a mechanism similar to a [[phonograph]], in which a needle-like stylus tracks on a 2.25 inch platter similar to a vinyl phonograph record. The Janex Corporation produced most of the clocks which use this device, and they are highly prized among collectors.

== Characters ==

A very large number of popular characters have appeared on talking clocks. The following list is not exhaustive, nor is it intended to be---The International Society of Talking Clocks Collectors (ISTCC)has a Museum collection of over 800 talking clocks.

* [[Mickey Mouse]]
* Several [[Looney Tunes]] characters (including Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Tweety, et al.)

A '''ternary computer''' (also called '''trinary computer''') is a [[computer]] that uses [[ternary logic]] (three possible values) instead of the more popular [[Principle of bivalence|binary system]] ("Base 2") in its calculations.

==History==
One early calculating machine, built by [[Thomas Fowler (inventor)|Thomas Fowler]] entirely from wood in 1840, operated in balanced ternary.&lt;ref name="tf1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://myweb.tiscali.co.uk/torrington/fowler.htm|title=Thomas Fowler biography|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070531221517/http://myweb.tiscali.co.uk/torrington/fowler.htm|archivedate=31 May 2007|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tf2"&gt;{{cite journal|url= http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?arnumber=1498715 |first1= Mark |last1= Glusker| first2= David M. |last2= Hogan| first3= Pamela |last3= Vass| title= The Ternary Calculating Machine of Thomas Fowler| journal= IEEE Annals of the History of Computing| volume= 27| number= 3| pages= 4–22| date= July–September 2005 | doi=10.1109/mahc.2005.49}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first modern, electronic ternary computer [[Setun]] was built in 1958 in the Soviet Union at the [[Moscow State University]] by [[Nikolay Brusentsov]],&lt;ref name="cmr"&gt;[http://www.computer-museum.ru/english/galglory_en/Brusentsov.htm Russian Virtual Computer Museum – Hall of Fame – Nikolay Petrovich Brusentsov], retrieved 2010-01-25.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Balanced ternary==
{{Main article|Balanced ternary}}
Ternary computing is commonly implemented in terms of [[balanced ternary]], which uses the three digits −1, 0, and +1. The negative value of any balanced [[ternary digit]] can be obtained by replacing every + with a − and vice versa. It is easy to subtract a number by inverting the + and − digits and then using normal addition. Balanced ternary can express negative values as easily as positive ones, without the need for a leading negative sign as with decimal numbers. These advantages make some calculations more efficient in ternary than binary.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} Considering that digit signs are mandatory, and nonzero digits are magnitude 1 only, notation using only zero and signs alone is more concise than when 1's are used.

{{quote|text=I often reflect that had the Ternary instead of the denary Notation been adopted in the Infancy of Society, machines something like the present would long ere this have been common, as the transition from mental to mechanical calculation would have been so very obvious and simple.|sign=[[Thomas Fowler (inventor)|Thomas Fowler]]|source=&lt;ref name="tf2" /&gt;}}

==Potential future applications==
With the advent of mass-produced binary components for computers, ternary computers have diminished in significance. However, [[Donald Knuth]] argues that they will be brought back into development in the future to take advantage of ternary logic's elegance and efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;Knuth, D.E. ''[[The Art of Computer Programming]] – Volume 2'': Seminumerical Algorithms, pp. 190–192. Addison-Wesley, 2nd ed., 1980. {{ISBN|0-201-03822-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; One possible way this could happen is by combining an [[optical computer]] with the [[ternary logic]] system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.iop.org/EJ/abstract/1402-4896/2005/T118/025/ |title=Ternary Optical Computer Architecture|author1=Jin Yi|author2=He Huacan|author3= Lü Yangtian|year=2005|doi=10.1238/Physica.Topical.118a00098|volume=2005|issue=98|journal=Phys. Scripta}}&lt;/ref&gt; A ternary computer using fiber optics could use dark as 0 and two orthogonal polarizations of light as 1 and −1. IBM also reports infrequently on ternary computing topics (in its papers), but it is not actively engaged in it.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

The [[Josephson junction]] has been proposed as a balanced ternary memory cell, using circulating superconducting currents, either clockwise, counterclockwise, or off.  "The advantages of the proposed memory circuit are capability of high speed computation, low power consumption and very simple construction with fewer elements due to the ternary operation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1109/ISMVL.1998.679270 | title=A Josephson ternary memory circuit | journal=Proceedings. 1998 28th IEEE International Symposium on Multiple- Valued Logic (Cat. No.98CB36138)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, a [[quantum computer]] was proposed which uses a quantum ternary state, a [[qutrit]], rather than the typical [[qubit]].{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} When the number of basic states of quantum element is ''d'', it is called [[qudit]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://nextbigfuture.com/2009/08/qudits-multilevel-versions-of-qubits.html Qudits] at NextBigFuture.com&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|does this make a 4-state "qubit" a qu4it?|date=December 2016}}

==Ternary computers in popular culture==
In [[Robert A. Heinlein]]'s novel ''[[Time Enough for Love]]'', the sapient computers of Secundus, the planet on which part of the framing story is set, including Minerva, use an unbalanced ternary system. Minerva, in reporting a calculation result, says "three hundred forty one thousand six hundred forty... the original ternary readout is unit pair pair comma unit nil nil comma unit pair pair comma unit nil nil point nil".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Heinlein, Robert A.|chapter=Variations on a Theme III: Domestic Problems|title=[[Time Enough for Love]]|publisher=Berkley Books|year=1982|page=99|isbn=0-399-11151-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Virtual Adepts in the roleplaying game ''[[Mage: The Ascension]]'' use ternary computers.

In [[Howard Tayler]]'s webcomic ''[[Schlock Mercenary]]'', every modern computer is a ternary computer.  AIs use the extra digit as "maybe" in boolean (true/false) operations, thus having a much more intimate understanding of [[fuzzy logic]] than is possible with binary computers.

The Conjoiners, in [[Alastair Reynolds]]' ''[[Revelation Space]]'' series, use ternary logic to program their computers and nanotechnology devices.

'''Thrust reversal''', also called '''reverse thrust''', is the temporary diversion of an [[aircraft engine]]'s [[thrust]] so that it is directed forward, rather than backward.  Reverse thrust acts against the forward travel of the aircraft, providing [[deceleration]].  Thrust reverser systems are featured on many [[jet aircraft]] to help slow down just after touch-down, reducing wear on the brakes and enabling shorter landing distances. Such devices affect the aircraft significantly and are considered important for safe operations by [[airline]]s. There have been accidents involving thrust reversal systems, including fatal ones.

Reverse thrust is also available on many [[Propeller (aircraft)|propeller-driven aircraft]] through reversing the [[controllable-pitch propeller]]s to a negative angle. The equivalent concept for a ship is called [[astern propulsion]].

==Principle and uses==
[[File:Rolls Royce RB.199 2.jpg|thumb|Half-deployed [[#Target type|target-type]] reverser of a [[Turbo-Union RB199|RB.199]] engine for the [[Panavia Tornado]], one of a very few fighter aircraft with thrust reversal]]

A landing roll consists of touchdown, bringing the aircraft to taxi speed, and eventually to a complete stop.  However, most commercial jet engines continue to produce thrust in the forward direction, even when idle, acting against the deceleration of the aircraft.&lt;ref name="Airplane handbook2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Federal Aviation Administration|title=Airplane Flying Handbook:Faa-h-8083-3a|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Zd5pt-nu6HUC&amp;pg=PT635|accessdate=9 July 2013|date=1 September 2011|publisher=Skyhorse Publishing Inc.|isbn=978-1-61608-338-0|pages=635–638}}&lt;/ref&gt; The brakes of the [[landing gear]] of most modern aircraft are sufficient in normal circumstances to stop the aircraft by themselves, but for safety purposes, and to reduce the stress on the brakes,&lt;ref name="Croucher2004 JAR" /&gt; another deceleration method is needed. In scenarios involving bad weather, where factors like snow or rain on the runway reduce the effectiveness of the brakes, and in emergencies like [[rejected takeoff]]s, this need is more pronounced.&lt;ref name="Soares2011 Gas turbines"&gt;{{cite book|author=Claire Soares|title=Gas Turbines: A Handbook of Air, Land and Sea Applications|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rTPZp1YCQBkC&amp;pg=PA315| accessdate=11 July 2013|date=1 April 2011|publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann|isbn=978-0-08-055584-3|pages=315–319, 359}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A simple and effective method is to reverse the direction of the exhaust stream of the jet engine and use the power of the engine itself to decelerate. Ideally, the reversed exhaust stream would be directed straight forward.&lt;ref name="MacIsaacLangton2011 Propulsion" /&gt; However, for [[aerodynamic]] reasons, this is not possible, and a 135° angle is taken, resulting in less effectiveness than would otherwise be possible. Thrust reversal can also be used in flight to reduce airspeed, though this is not common with modern aircraft.&lt;ref name=Purdue&gt;{{cite web|title=Thrust Reversing|url=https://engineering.purdue.edu/~propulsi/propulsion/jets/basics/reverse.html|publisher=Purdue AAE Propulsion|accessdate=10 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are three common types of thrust reversing systems used on jet engines: the target, clam-shell, and cold stream systems. Some propeller-driven aircraft equipped with [[variable-pitch propeller]]s can reverse thrust by changing the [[Pitch plane|pitch]] of their propeller blades. Most commercial jetliners have such devices, and it also has applications in military aviation.&lt;ref name="MacIsaacLangton2011 Propulsion"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Bernie MacIsaac|author2=Roy Langton|title=Gas Turbine Propulsion Systems|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cCd_-bNmtmcC&amp;pg=PA152|accessdate=11 July 2013|date=6 September 2011|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-470-06563-1|pages=152–155}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of thrust reversal systems==
Small aircraft typically do not have thrust reversal systems, except in specialized applications. On the other hand, large aircraft (those weighing more than 12,500&amp;nbsp;lb) almost always have the ability to reverse thrust. [[Reciprocating engine]], [[turboprop]] and jet aircraft can all be designed to include thrust reversal systems.

===Propeller-driven aircraft===
[[File:US Navy 060403-N-0499M-151 A Sailor performs maintenance to an E-2C Hawkeye.jpg|thumb|Variable-pitch propellers of an [[Northrop Grumman E-2 Hawkeye|E-2C Hawkeye]]]]

[[File:Klm f100 ph-kle arp.jpg|thumb|Target 'bucket' thrust reverser deployed on the [[Rolls-Royce RB.183 Tay|Tay]] engines of a [[Fokker 100]]]]
Propeller-driven aircraft generate reverse thrust by changing the angle of their [[controllable-pitch propeller]]s so that the propellers direct their thrust forward. This reverse thrust feature became available with the development of controllable-pitch propellers, which change the angle of the propeller blades to make efficient use of engine power over a wide range of conditions. Single-engine aircraft tend not to have reverse thrust. However, single-engine [[turboprop]] aircraft such as the [[PAC P-750 XSTOL]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=P-750 XSTOL Specifications|url=http://www.aerospace.co.nz/aircraft/p-750-xstol/specifications|publisher=Pacific Aerospace|accessdate=9 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cessna 208 Caravan]], and [[Pilatus PC-6 Porter]] do have this feature available.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

One special application of reverse thrust comes in its use on multi-engine [[seaplane]]s and [[flying boat]]s. These aircraft, when landing on water, have no conventional braking method and must rely on [[Zigzag|slaloming]] and/or reverse thrust, as well as the [[Drag (physics)|drag]] of the water in order to slow or stop. In addition, reverse thrust is often necessary for maneuvering on the water, where it is used to make tight turns or even propel the aircraft in reverse, maneuvers which may prove necessary for leaving a dock or beach.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

===Jet aircraft===
On aircraft using jet engines, thrust reversal is accomplished by causing the [[jet blast]] to flow forward. The engine does not run or rotate in reverse; instead, thrust reversing devices are used to block the blast and redirect it forward. High [[Bypass ratio|bypass ratio engines]] usually reverse thrust by changing the direction of only the fan airflow, since the majority of thrust is generated by this section, as opposed to the core. There are three jet engine thrust reversal systems in common use:&lt;ref name=Purdue /&gt;

====Target type====
{{main|Target-type thrust reversal}}
The target thrust reverser uses a pair of [[hydraulic]]ally-operated 'bucket' type doors to reverse the hot gas stream. For forward thrust, these doors form the propelling nozzle of the engine. In the original implementation of this system on the [[Boeing 707]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=zSADAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=-PA24 "Boeing's Jet Stratoliner."] ''Popular Science'', July 1954, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; and still common today, two reverser buckets were hinged so when deployed they block the rearward flow of the exhaust and redirect it with a forward component. This type of reverser is visible at the rear of the engine during deployment.&lt;ref name=Purdue /&gt;

====Clam-shell type====
The clam-shell door, or cascade, system is [[pneumatic]]ally operated. When activated, the doors rotate to open the ducts and close the normal exit, causing the thrust to be directed forward.&lt;ref name="Purdue" /&gt; The cascade thrust reverser is commonly used on turbofan engines. On turbojet engines, this system would be less effective than the target system, as the cascade system only makes use of the fan airflow and does not affect the main engine core, which continues to produce thrust.&lt;ref name="Airplane handbook2011" /&gt;[[File:VC10 Aircraft at an Airfield in the Middle East MOD 45150451.jpg|thumb|Clam-shell outlet grating open (outboard engine) on a [[Rolls-Royce Conway]] turbofan of a [[VC10]]]]

====Cold stream type====
[[File:Airbus A340-313E, Finnair JP7679383.jpg|thumb|Pivoting-door thrust reversal seen on the [[CFM-56]] engines of an Airbus A340-300]]
In addition to the two types used on [[turbojet]] and low-bypass turbofan engines, a third type of thrust reverser is found on some high-bypass turbofan engines. Doors in the [[bypass duct]] are used to redirect the air that is accelerated by the engine's fan section but does not pass through the [[combustion chamber]] (called bypass air) such that it provides reverse thrust.&lt;ref name="Soares2011 Gas turbines" /&gt; The cold stream reverser system is activated by an air motor. During normal operation, the reverse thrust vanes are blocked. On selection, the system folds the doors to block off the cold stream final [[nozzle]] and redirect this airflow to the cascade vanes.&lt;ref name=Purdue /&gt; This system can redirect both the exhaust flow of the fan and of the core.&lt;ref name="MacIsaacLangton2011 Propulsion" /&gt;

The cold stream system is known for structural integrity, reliability, and versatility. During thrust reverser activation, a sleeve mounted around the perimeter of the [[aircraft engine]] [[nacelle]] moves aft to expose cascade vanes which act to redirect the engine fan flow. This thrust reverser system can be heavy and difficult to integrate into nacelles housing large engines.&lt;ref name="AsburyYetter2000 NASA" /&gt;
[[File:PH-BVC KLM (3701878334).jpg|thumb|Cold-stream type thrust reverser being deployed on a Boeing 777-300.]]

==Operation==
[[File:Thrust levers of a Boeing 747-8.jpg|thumb|Reverse thrust levers forward of the main levers, seen on a [[Boeing 747-8]]]]
In most cockpit setups, reverse thrust is set when the thrust levers are on idle by pulling them further back.&lt;ref name="Airplane handbook2011" /&gt; Reverse thrust is typically applied immediately after touchdown, often along with [[Spoiler (aeronautics)|spoiler]]s, to improve deceleration early in the landing roll when residual [[aerodynamic lift]] and high speed limit the effectiveness of the brakes located on the landing gear. Reverse thrust is always selected manually, either using levers attached to the [[thrust lever]]s or moving the thrust levers into a reverse thrust 'gate'.

The early deceleration provided by reverse thrust can reduce landing roll by a quarter or more.&lt;ref name="MacIsaacLangton2011 Propulsion" /&gt; Regulations dictate, however, that an aircraft must be able to land on a runway without the use of thrust reversal in order to be certified to land there as part of [[airline|scheduled airline]] service.

Once the aircraft's speed has slowed, reverse thrust is shut down to prevent the reversed airflow from throwing debris in front of the engine intakes where it can be ingested, causing [[foreign object damage]]. If circumstances require it, reverse thrust can be used all the way to a stop, or even to provide thrust to push the aircraft backward, though [[Pushback|aircraft tug]]s or [[towbar]]s are more commonly used for that purpose. When reverse thrust is used to push an aircraft back from the gate, the maneuver is called a [[powerback]]. Some manufacturers warn against the use of this procedure during icy conditions as using reverse thrust on snow- or slush-covered ground can cause slush, water, and runway deicers to become airborne and adhere to wing surfaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boeing.com/commercial/aeromagazine/articles/2010_q4/2/ |title=Safe Winter Operations |publisher=Boeing Corp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the full power of reverse thrust is not desirable, thrust reverse can be operated with the throttle set at less than full power, even down to idle power, which reduces stress and wear on engine components. Reverse thrust is sometimes selected on idling engines to eliminate residual thrust, in particular in icy or slick conditions, or when the engines' [[jet blast]] could cause damage.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

===In-flight operation===
[[File:C17 Reverse Thrust.JPG|thumb|right|A [[vortex]] made visible as powerback is used on a [[Boeing C-17 Globemaster III]]]]
Some aircraft, notably some Russian and [[Soviet aircraft]], are able to safely use reverse thrust in flight, though the majority of these are propeller-driven. Many commercial aircraft, however, cannot. In-flight use of reverse thrust has several advantages. It allows for rapid deceleration, enabling quick changes of speed. It also prevents the speed build-up normally associated with steep dives, allowing for rapid loss of [[altitude]], which can be especially useful in hostile environments such as combat zones, and when making steep approaches to land.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

The [[Douglas DC-8]] series of airliners has been certified for in-flight reverse thrust since service entry in 1959. Safe and effective for facilitating quick descents at acceptable speeds, it nonetheless produced significant aircraft buffeting, so actual use was less common on passenger flights and more common on cargo and ferry flights, where passenger comfort is not a concern.&lt;ref&gt;https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19950022395.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Hawker Siddeley Trident]], a 120- to 180-seat airliner, was capable of descending at up to 10,000&amp;nbsp;ft/min (3,050&amp;nbsp;m/min) by use of reverse thrust, though this capability was rarely used.

The [[Concorde]] supersonic airliner could use reverse thrust in the air to increase the rate of descent.  Only the inboard engines were used, and the engines were placed in reverse idle only in [[subsonic flight]] and when the aircraft was below 30,000&amp;nbsp;ft in altitude. This would increase the rate of descent to around 10,000&amp;nbsp;ft/min.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

The [[Boeing C-17 Globemaster III]] is one of the few modern aircraft that uses reverse thrust in flight. The Boeing-manufactured aircraft is capable of in-flight deployment of reverse thrust on all four engines to facilitate steep tactical descents up to 15,000&amp;nbsp;ft/min (4,600&amp;nbsp;m/min) into combat environments (a descent rate of just over 170&amp;nbsp;mph, or 274&amp;nbsp;km/h). The [[Lockheed C-5 Galaxy]], introduced in 1969, also has in-flight reverse capability, although on the inboard engines only.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://foxtrotalpha.jalopnik.com/what-it-is-like-to-fly-the-americas-biggest-jet-the-ga-1727650088|title=What It's Like To Fly America's Biggest Jet, The Gargantuan C-5 Galaxy|first=Tyler|last=Rogoway|date=|website=jalopnik.com|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Saab 37 Viggen]] (retired in November 2005) also had the ability to use reverse thrust both before landing, to shorten the needed runway, and taxiing after landing, allowing many Swedish roads to double as [[Highway strip|wartime runways]].

The [[Shuttle Training Aircraft]], a highly modified [[Grumman Gulfstream II]], used reverse thrust in flight to help simulate [[Space Shuttle]] aerodynamics so astronauts could practice landings. A similar technique was employed on a modified [[Tupolev Tu-154]] which simulated the Russian [[Buran (spacecraft)|Buran]] space shuttle.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

==Effectiveness==
The amount of thrust and [[Power (physics)|power]] generated are proportional to the speed of the aircraft, making reverse thrust more effective at high speeds.&lt;ref name="Croucher2004 JAR"&gt;{{cite book|author=Phil Croucher|title=JAR Professional Pilot Studies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KY-MBUeQoZEC&amp;pg=SA3-PA23|accessdate =11 July 2013|date=1 March 2004|publisher=Lulu.com|isbn=978-0-9681928-2-5|pages=3–23}}&lt;/ref&gt; For maximum effectiveness, it should be applied quickly after touchdown.&lt;ref name="Airplane handbook2011" /&gt; If activated at low speeds, [[foreign object damage]] is possible. There is some danger of an aircraft with thrust reversers applied momentarily leaving the ground again due to both the effect of the reverse thrust and the nose-up pitch effect from the [[Air brake (aircraft)|spoilers]]. For aircraft susceptible to such an occurrence, pilots must take care to achieve a firm position on the ground before applying reverse thrust.&lt;ref name="Croucher2004 JAR" /&gt; If applied before the nose-wheel is in contact with the ground, there is a chance of asymmetric deployment causing an uncontrollable [[Aircraft principal axes#Normal axis (yaw)|yaw]] towards the side of higher thrust, as steering the aircraft with the nose wheel is the only way to maintain control of the direction of travel in this situation.&lt;ref name="Airplane handbook2011" /&gt;

Reverse thrust mode is used only for a fraction of aircraft operating time but affects it greatly in terms of [[Aircraft designer|design]], weight, [[Aircraft maintenance|maintenance]], performance, and cost. Penalties are significant but necessary since it provides stopping force for added safety margins, directional control during landing rolls, and aids in rejected take-offs and ground operations on contaminated runways where normal braking effectiveness is diminished. Airlines consider thrust reverser systems a vital part of reaching a maximum level of [[Airplane safety|aircraft operating safety]].&lt;ref name="AsburyYetter2000 NASA"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Scott C.

==Thrust reversal-related accidents and incidents==
In-flight deployment of reverse thrust has directly contributed to the crashes of several transport-type aircraft:

* On 11 February 1978 [[Pacific Western Airlines Flight 314]], a [[Boeing 737-200]], crashed while executing a rejected landing at [[Cranbrook Airport]]. The left thrust reverser had not properly stowed; it deployed during the climbout, causing the aircraft to roll to the left and strike the ground. Out of 5 crew members and 44 passengers, only 6 passengers and a flight attendant survived.
*On 9 February 1982 [[Japan Airlines Flight 350]] crashed {{convert|1000|ft|m|-2}} short of the runway at [[Haneda Airport|Tokyo Haneda Airport]] following the intentional deployment of reverse thrust on two of the [[Douglas DC-8]]'s four engines by the mentally unstable captain, resulting in 24 passenger deaths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.airdisaster.com/cgi-bin/view_details.cgi?date=02091982&amp;reg=JA8061&amp;airline=Japan+Air+Lines|title=Accident Database: Accident Synopsis 02091982&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|author=|date=|website=airdisaster.com|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stokes, Henry Scott.

*On 29 August 1990, a United States Air Force [[Lockheed C-5 Galaxy]] crashed shortly after take-off from [[Ramstein Air Base]] in [[Germany]]. As the aircraft started to climb off the runway, one of the thrust reversers suddenly deployed. This resulted in loss of control of the aircraft and the subsequent crash. Of the 17 people on board, 4 survived the crash.
*On 26 May 1991, [[Lauda Air Flight 004]], a [[Boeing 767|Boeing 767-300ER]], had an accidental deployment of the left engine's thrust reverser, which caused the airliner to go into a rapid dive and break up in mid-air.&lt;ref name="Tailstrike"&gt;{{cite web | title = 26 May 1991 – Lauda 004 | publisher = Tailstrike.com: [[Cockpit Voice Recorder]] Database | url = http://www.tailstrike.com/260591.htm | date = 2004-09-23 | accessdate = 2006-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; All 213 passengers and 10 crew were killed.
*On 31 October 1996, [[TAM Linhas Aéreas Flight 402]], a [[Fokker 100]], crashed shortly after take-off from [[Congonhas-São Paulo International Airport]], [[São Paulo]], [[Brazil]], striking two apartment buildings and several houses. All 90 passengers and 6 crew members as well as 3 people on the ground died in the crash. The crash was attributed to the un-commanded deployment of a faulty thrust reverser on the right engine shortly after take-off.
* On 10 February 2004, [[Kish Air Flight 7170]], a [[Fokker 50]], crashed while on approach to [[Sharjah International Airport]]. A total of 43 out of the 46 passengers and crew on board were killed. Investigators determined that the pilots had prematurely set the propellers to reverse thrust mode, causing them to lose control of the aircraft.
* On 17 July 2007, [[TAM Linhas Aéreas Flight 3054]], a [[Airbus A320]] crashed after landing on [[Congonhas-São Paulo International Airport]], [[São Paulo]], [[Brazil]], hitting a [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]] Gas station, cars, and finally the [[TAM Express]] building, killing a total of 199 people, 187 aboard the plane and 11 on the ground, leaving no survivors. The crash was attributed to a malfunction in the right thrust reverser.
