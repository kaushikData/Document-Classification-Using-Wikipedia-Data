{{History of the Ottoman Empire|expanded=defeat}}
The '''31 March Incident''' ({{lang-tr|31 Mart Vakası}}, {{lang|tr|italic=yes|31 Mart Olayı}}, {{lang|tr|italic=yes|31 Mart Hadisesi}}, or {{lang|tr|italic=yes|31 Mart İsyanı}}) was the defeat of the [[Ottoman countercoup of 1909]] by the ''Hareket Ordusu'' ("Army of Action"), which was the 11th Salonika Reserve Infantry Division of the [[Third Army (Ottoman Empire)|Third Army]] stationed in the [[Balkans]] and commanded by [[Mahmud Shevket Pasha]] on 24 April 1909. The counter coup began on 31 March on the [[Rumi calendar]], which was the official calendar of the [[Ottoman Empire]], corresponding to 13 April 1909 on the Gregorian calendar now used in Turkey. The rebellion had begun on 13 April 1909 and was put down by 24 April 1909. Ottoman historiography link the two events under the name ''31 March Incident'' but refers to the actions by the Hareket Ordusu, the subsequent [[Second Constitutional Era#Constitutional Revision, August 1909|restoration of the constitution]] for a third time (after earlier attempts in 1876 and 1908) and the deposition of [[Abdul Hamid II]] who was then replaced by his younger brother [[Mehmed V]].

==Background ==
The [[Young Turk Revolution]], which began in the [[Balkans|Balkan]] provinces, spread quickly throughout the empire and resulted in the Sultan Abdul Hamid II announcing the restoration of the [[Ottoman constitution of 1876]] on 3 July 1908. The [[Ottoman general election, 1908|Ottoman general election of 1908]] took place during November and December of that year. The [[Senate of the Ottoman Empire]] reconvened for the first time in over 30 years on 17 December 1908. The [[Chamber of Deputies (Ottoman Empire)|Chamber of Deputies]]' first session was on 30 January 1909. The [[Ottoman countercoup of 1909|Ottoman counter-coup of 13 April 1909]] was a rebellion by conservative [[reactionary|reactionaries]] in Constantinople against the restoration of the constitutional system. The counter-coup attempted to put an end to the nascent Second Constitutional Era in order to re-affirm the position of the Sultan Abdul Hamid II as the absolute monarch. The counter-coup, was instigated among some parts of the army primarily by a certain Cypriot Islamic extremist&lt;ref name="Kaylan"&gt;{{cite book|author=Muammer Kaylan|title=The Kemalists: Islamic Revival and the Fate of Secular Turkey|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aEh_IofABkYC&amp;pg=PA74|publisher=Prometheus Books, Publishers|isbn=978-1-61592-897-2|page=74}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dervish Vahdeti]], who reigned supreme in [[Constantinople]] for a few days.

==Event==
The CUP appealed to [[Mahmud Shevket Pasha]], commander of the [[Third Army (Ottoman Empire)|Ottoman Third Army]] based in Salonika to quell the uprising&lt;ref name="Gawrych167"/&gt; by Dervish Vahdeti and his supporters. With support from the commander of the [[Second Army (Ottoman Empire)|Ottoman Second Army]] in [[Edirne]], Mahmud Shevket combined the armies to create a strike force named ''Hareket Ordusu'' ("Army of Action").&lt;ref name="Gawrych167"/&gt; The Army of Action numbered 20,000-25,000 Ottoman troops.&lt;ref name="Gawrych167"/&gt; They were joined by 15,000 volunteers including 4,000 Bulgarians, 2,000 Greeks and 700 Jews.&lt;ref name="Gawrych167"/&gt; Some Albanians supported the Army of Action.&lt;ref name="Gawrych168"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gawrych|first=George|title=The Crescent and the Eagle: Ottoman rule, Islam and the Albanians, 1874–1913|year=2006|location=London|publisher=IB Tauris|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=wPOtzk-unJgC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+crescent+and+the+eagle:+Ottoman+rule,+Islam+and+the+Albanians,+1874-1913+lexicon&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiT94zl8ebXAhWJT7wKHYRLADEQ6AEIJjAA#v=snippet&amp;q=counterrevolution&amp;f=false|isbn=9781845112875|pages=168|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mahmud Shevket was joined by [[Çerçiz Topulli]] and [[Bajram Curri]] who brought 8,000 Albanian men and Major [[Ahmed Niyazi Bey]] with 1,800 men from [[Resne]] for military operations directed by Ali Pasha Kolonja to retake Istanbul.&lt;ref name="Skendi364365"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gawrych167"&gt;{{harvnb|Gawrych|2006|p=167.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among other officers who entered the capital was [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk|Mustafa Kemal]].&lt;ref name=bardakci&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://arsiv.sabah.com.tr/2007/04/16/haber,277FF98A4D72490280439AB4F2A5A2F1.html |accessdate=28 December 2008 |title=Askerin siyasete yerleşmesi 31 Mart isyanıyla başladı |date=16 April 2007 |language=Turkish |first=Murat |last=Bardakci |work=Sabah }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Army of Action laid siege to Constantinople on 17 April 1909. 

The Sultan remained in the Yildiz  and had frequent conferences with Grand Vizier Tewfik Pasha who announced: {{quote|His Sublime Majesty awaits benevolently the arrival of the so called constitutional army. He has nothing to gain or fear since his Sublimity is for the Constitution and is its supreme guardian.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Frederick Knight, The Awakening of Turkey: A History of the Turkish Revolution, page 342&lt;/ref&gt;}} Negotiations continued for six days. The negotiators were Rear Admiral Arif Hikmet Pasha, Emanuel Karasu Efendi (Carasso), Esad Pasha Toptani, Aram Efendi and Colonel Galip Bey (Pasiner).  Finally, at the moment when the conflict showed signs of extending to the public, the Salonikan troops entered Constantinople.

The Macedonian troops attacked the Taksim and Tashkishla barracks. There was fierce street fighting in the European quarter where the guard houses were held by the First Army Corps. There was heavy fire from troops in the Tashkishla barracks against the advancing troops. The barracks had to be shelled and almost destroyed by the artillery located on the heights above the barracks before the garrison surrendered after several hours fighting and heavy losses.  Equally desperate was the defence of the Taksim barracks. The attack on the Taksim barracks was led by Enver Bey. After a short battle they gained control of the palace on 27 April.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Frederick Knight, The Awakening of Turkey: A History of the Turkish Revolution, page 348&lt;/ref&gt;

Sultan Abdul Hamid was deserted by most of his advisors. The parliament discussed the question as to whether he would be permitted to remain on the throne or be deposed or even be executed. Putting the Sultan to death was considered unwise as such a step might rouse a fanatical response and plunge the Empire into civil war. On the other hand, there were those who felt that after all that had happened it was impossible that the Parliament could ever again work with the Sultan.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Frederick Knight, The Awakening of Turkey: A History of the Turkish Revolution, page 350&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 27 the  Assembly held a meeting behind closed doors under the presidency of Said Pasha. A fetva drawn up in the form of question and answer and signed by the Sheikh ul Islam was read to the assembled members:  {{quote|If an imam of the Moslems tampers with and burns the sacred books.&lt;BR&gt; If he appropriates public money.&lt;BR&gt;  If after killing imprisoning and exiling his subjects unjustly, he swears to amend his ways and then perjures himself.&lt;BR&gt;  If he causes civil war and bloodshed among his own people.&lt;BR&gt;  If it is shown that his country will gain peace by his removal and if it be considered by those who have power that this imam should abdicate or be deposed.&lt;BR&gt;  Is it lawful that one of these alternatives be adopted.&lt;BR&gt;  The answer is "Olur" (it is permissible).&lt;ref&gt;Edward Frederick Knight, The Awakening of Turkey: A History of the Turkish Revolution, page 351&lt;/ref&gt;}} Then the Assembly unanimously voted that Abdul Hamid should be deposed.

== Outcome ==
{{unreferenced|section|date=April 2018}}
The counter-coup's failure brought the [[Committee of Union and Progress]] back into power enabling it to form government.

The incident led to a change of [[Grand Vizier]] with [[Ahmed Tevfik Pasha]] assumed the position. Other consequences were [[Second Constitutional Era#Constitutional Revision, August 1909|restoration of constitution]] for a third time (after earlier attempts in 1876 and 1908). The CUP used the events of the counterrevolution to depose [[Abdul Hamid II]] on April 27 in favor of his younger brother [[Mehmed V]].&lt;ref name="Skendi364365"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gawrych167"/&gt; Four CUP members composed of one Armenian, one Jew and two Muslim Albanians went to inform the sultan of his dethronement with [[Essad Pasha Toptani]] saying "the nation has deposed you".&lt;ref name="Gawrych167"/&gt; Some Muslims expressed dismay that non Muslims had informed the sultan of his deposition.&lt;ref name="Gawrych167"/&gt; Abdul Hamid II reserved his anger only toward Toptani calling him a "wicked man" whom he felt betrayed him as the Albanian Toptani family had benefited from royal patronage through privileges and positions in the Ottoman system.&lt;ref name="Gawrych167"&gt;{{harvnb|Gawrych|2006|p=167.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Albanians involved in the counterrevolutionary movement were executed such as Halil Bey from [[Krajë]] which caused indignation among conservative Muslims of [[Shkodër]].&lt;ref name="Skendi364365"&gt;{{cite book|last=Skendi|first=Stavro|title=The Albanian national awakening|year=1967|location=Princeton|publisher=Princeton University Press|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=8QPWCgAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR15&amp;dq=The+Albanian+National+Awakening&amp;ots=zGjQbVyql8&amp;sig=xsmbL-yAAtc-ny3v0E4vN87JOBY&amp;redir_esc=y#v=snippet&amp;q=April%2013&amp;f=false|isbn=9781400847761|pages=364-365.|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the 31 March Incident, the Committee of Union and Progress outlawed societies which supported ethnic minorities' interests within Ottoman society, including the [[Society of Arab Ottoman Brotherhood]], and prohibited the publication of several journals and newspapers that featured radical Islamic rhetoric.

Under the multi-religious "balancing policies", the Committee of Union and Progress believed it could achieve an "[[Ottomanism|Ottomanisation]]" (i.e. Ottoman nationalism rather than ethnic or religious nationalism) of all the subjects of the Empire. These measures were successful in stirring some nationalist sentiment among the non-Turkish populations, further cementing a national sensibility resistant to conservative Islam.

==Memorial==
The [[Monument of Liberty, Istanbul|Monument of Liberty]] ({{lang-ota|Abide-i Hürriyet}}) was erected 1911 in [[Şişli]] district of Istanbul as a memorial to the 74 soldiers killed in action during this event.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2963">'''Abraham Cohen de Herrera''' ({{lang-he-n|רבי אברהם כהן בן דוד דה-הירירה}}), also known as '''Alonso Nunez de Herrera''' or '''Abraham Irira''' (c. 1570 – c. 1635), was a [[Philosophy of religion|religious philosopher]] and [[Kabbalah|cabbalist]]. He is supposed by the historian [[Heinrich Graetz]] to have been born in 1570. He is widely supposed to have been descended from a [[Marrano]] family: place of birth is unknown but may (according to Barbosa Machado the [[List of biographers|biographer]]) have been [[Lisbon]], [[Portugal]]. Other sources link him to [[Italy]], specifically [[Tuscany]], and as the son of the last Chief Rabbi of [[Córdoba, Spain|Córdoba]] in [[Spain]].

He is known to have married a Sara de Herrera in [[Amsterdam]] in 1600; however, it is unlikely that this is the wife's original surname. It is also reasonably certain that he had an uncle, Juan de Marchena, who worked as a factor for the [[List of rulers of Morocco|Sultan of Morocco]] Moulay, [[Ahmad al-Mansur]].

While in [[Cadiz]] on the [[Sultan]]'s business, Herrera is supposed to have been captured by the [[Kingdom of England|English]], was released again after an exchange of [[diplomacy|diplomatic]] correspondence between the Sultan and [[List of monarchs of England|Queen]] [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]], and travelled thereafter to Amsterdam, where he returned to [[Judaism]]. His date of death is between 1635 and 1639: Wiener believes it was 1635. According to Rodriguez de Castro he may have died in [[Vienna]]. He wrote several works, originally in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] but later (in accordance with his will) translated to [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]].

==Works==
*''Epistle on Shiur Qomah'', an attempted reconciliation between [[kabbalah]] and philosophy.  However, as [[Alexander Altmann]], writes "Herrera was too much of a genuine philosopher to believe in the possibility of a fusion of the two realms, and he was too much of a genuine kabbalist to wish for it."
*''Puerta Del Cielo'', a discourse on [[kabbalah]] and religious themes of [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]], and [[Islam]], in relation to Occidentalism and Platonic philosophy.  Among few texts of the Kabbalah written and directed toward common readership; criticized as such.

'''Abraham Polonski''' (aka "Pol" or "Maurice Ferrer") was born in Russia in 1913. He was one of the founders of the French Jewish [[French Resistance|Resistance]] movement, having previously worked as an electrical engineer in Toulouse.

By June 1940, the French army had surrendered to Germany. Polonski and others established an underground organization called La Main Forte, meaning "The Strong Hand".&lt;ref&gt;Jews in France during World War II By Renée Poznanski, Nathan Bracher, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1942 Polonski and [[Labor Movement]] [[Zionist]] activists also established the [[Armee Juive]] (AJ), or Jewish Army, which was a commando force composed of the [[Zionist youth movement]] members.&lt;ref&gt;France: the dark years, 1940-1944 By Julian Jackson&lt;/ref&gt; During 1943–1944, the Jewish Army helped some hundreds of its members to successfully escape to Spain and then [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]. The group fought in [[Toulouse]], [[Nice]], [[Lyon]], and [[Paris]] areas, attacking informers who had collaborated with the [[Gestapo]] and helped liberate France in the summer of 1944. 

They were funded to the sum of tens of millions of francs by the [[Jewish Agency]] and from the [[American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee]].

He went on to become a [[Haganah]] commander of the AJ in France and North Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Guide to unpublished materials of the Holocaust period : Volume 2 / edited by Jacob Robinson and Yehuda Bauer.&lt;/ref&gt;

Biographical information on Adso comes mainly from one single source and has come under question, but the traditional biography depicts him as an abbot who enacted important monastic reform, as a scholar, and as a writer of five [[hagiographies]]. His best-known work was a biography of [[Antichrist]], titled "''De ortu et tempore Antichristi''", which combined exegetical and [[Sibylline Oracles|Sibylline]] lore. This letter became one of the best-known medieval descriptions of Antichrist, copied many times and of great influence on all later apocalyptic tradition, in part because, rather than as an [[exegesis]] of apocalyptic texts, he chose to describe Antichrist in the style of a hagiography.

==Biography==
Biographical knowledge of Adso is limited to the comments made by a chronicler from his abbey, who wrote a half century after him; a successor of his under abbot Bruno finished Adso's final hagiography, on [[Bercharius]], and in the process provided us with biographical detail.&lt;ref name=konrad&gt;{{cite book|first=Robert|last=Konrad|title=De ortu et tempore Antichristi: Antichristvorstellung und Geschichtsbild des Abtes Adso von Montier-en-Der|publisher=Michael Lassleben|location=Kallmünz|year=1964|pages=16-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Supposedly born into a wealthy, noble family&lt;ref name=grey&gt;{{Cite CE1913|wstitle=Adso|first=Francis W.|last=Grey}}&lt;/ref&gt; near Saint-Claude in the early 900s, he was educated at [[Luxeuil Abbey]] and became [[scholaster]] at [[Saint-Epvre]] near [[Toul]].&lt;ref name=omont/&gt; When his colleague Albéric was called from Saint-Epvre to become abbot at [[Montier-en-Der Abbey]], Adso accompanied him there and was elected abbot on Albéric's death, around 968. When [[Hilduin II, Count of Arcis-sur-Aube|Hilduin II]] (brother of Manassès († 991), [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Troyes|bishop of Troyes]], who had committed many acts of violence) turned to him for [[penance]], one of the things he imposed on him was a pilgrimage to [[Jerusalem]]. Following the example of [[Bercharius|Saint Bercharius]], the patron saint of Montier-en-Der who had accompanied one of the murderers of [[Leodegar|Saint Leodegar]] to Jerusalem, he went with him but died at sea. He was buried on an island called ''Astilia'', possibly identified as [[Astypalaia]].&lt;ref name=omont/&gt; Adso was charged with monastic reforms at [[St. Benignus' Abbey, Dijon]], by [[Bruno of Roucy]], which he enacted between 982 and 985.&lt;ref name=konrad/&gt;

Among his friends was Gerbert, afterwards [[Pope Sylvester II]], and their correspondence indicates how Adso took great care in building a library. His collection was noteworthy: the detailed inventory lists (prepared by his monks after his departure, and preserved in an appendix to a copy of the [[Martyrology of Usuard]]) only three complete volumes of theology, and focused heavily on classical literature and commentary thereon.&lt;ref name=omont/&gt;

The accepted biography, however, was questioned by a number of scholars since the late 20th century, with Daniel Verhelst, the most recent editor of the letter on Antichrist, being the first to doubt what is called the "long chronology", followed by Monique Goullet, editor of Adso's hagiographies. Its sourcing was already questionable, with one of the corroborating pieces of evidence a charter that was in fact used by the author of Adso's biographical sketch. This accepted account has Adso lead an extremely long life, going to Jerusalem sometime between age 72 and 82. But if his birth is placed close to 920, to have him on his pilgrimage as young as possible, he could hardly have been a teacher of renown in the 930s at Toul and either way it begs the question of why it took a scholar of such renown over 30 years to gain an abbacy.&lt;ref name=maclean&gt;{{cite journal |last=MacLean |first=Simon |title= Reform, Queenship and the End of the World in Tenth-Century France: Adso's 'Letter on the Origin and Time of the Antichrist' Reconsidered|journal=Revue belge de philologie et d'histoire|volume=86|issue=3-4|year=2008|pages=645–75|url=https://www.persee.fr/doc/rbph_0035-0818_2008_num_86_3_7582}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another complicating factor is the ''Life of Clotilde'', a hagiography of [[Clotilde]] possibly written for [[Gerberga of Saxony]], the recipient of the letter on Antichrist, whose author is argued by a number of scholar to be identical with the author of the letter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Karl-Ferdinand|last=Werner|title=Der Autor der ''Vita Sanctae Chrothildis''. Ein Beitrag zur Idee der 'Heiligen Königin' und der 'römischen Reiches' im X. Jahrhundert|journal=Mittellateinisches Jahrbuch|volume=24/25|year=1989-90|pages=517–51|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Goullet proposes a somewhat shortened biography, with Adso born in the 930s--which would mean that he would have written the letter possibly as a teenager. Simon Maclean proposes a radically different solution: in a nutshell, he suggests two Adsos ("Adso" being a very common name at the time)--the one, of Montier-en-Der, the author of the hagiographies; the other, Adso the abbot of [[St-Basle Abbey]] at [[Verzy]] (c. 970 – c. 991), whose epitaph was written by Adso of Montier-en-Der. Verzy is near [[Rheims]], one of the most important locations in the sphere of influence of Gerberga, and a center of the monastic reform which she was interested in. This Adso, then, could be the author of the letter and of the ''Life of Clotilde''.&lt;ref name=maclean/&gt;

==Works==
The largest remaining part of Adso's literary output consists of hagiographies; he wrote the lives of five saints: [[Mansuetus (bishop of Toul)|Mansuetus]], [[Frobert of Troyes]], [[Waldebert]], [[Basolus]] and [[Bercharius]],&lt;ref name=emmerson/&gt; and a short ''libellus'' on the [[Translation (relic)|translation]] of and miracles associated with Basolus. He also wrote hymns, and a rendering in verse of the second book of [[Pope Gregory I]]'s ''Dialogues'' (that second book is essentially a hagiography of [[St. Benedict]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=H-lrSGeNTAMC |p= xxii |title= The Dialogues of Saint Gregory the Great: Re-edited with an Introduction and Notes |volume=9 |series= Christian Roman Empire |first=Edmund G. |last= Gardner |publisher= Arx Publishing, LLC |isbn= 978-1-8897-5894-7 |origyear= 1911}}&lt;/ref&gt;), and the famous ''Epistola Adsonis ad Gerbergam reginam de ortu et tempore antichristi'', frequently abbreviated ''De antichristo'', a tract on the life and career of the [[Antichrist]] written as a letter to [[Gerberga of Saxony]], the wife of [[Louis IV of France|Louis IV d'Outremer]].&lt;ref name=grey/&gt;

''De antichristo'' was not an original work; it combined exegesis of biblical text with Sibylline (that is, oracular) accounts. The most important exegetical text was the commentary on 2 Thessalonians by [[Haimo of Auxerre]],&lt;ref name=maclean/&gt; but Adso also used [[Jerome]]'s ''De Antichristo in Danielem'', and [[Alcuin]]'s ''De Fide Sanctae et Individuae Trinitatis''. The most important oracular one is the myth of the Last Emperor found in (Latin reworkings of the originally Syriac) ''[[Apocalypse of Pseudo-Methodius]]'', besides the oracles of the [[Tiburtine Sibyl]],&lt;ref name=emmerson/&gt; though some scholars deny the latter as a source.&lt;ref name=latowsky&gt;{{cite book|title=Emperor of the World: Charlemagne and the Construction of Imperial Authority, 800–1229|first=Anne A.|last=Latowsky|publisher=Cornell UP|year=2013|isbn=9780801451485|page=71}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adso's true innovation (an argument proposed by Robert Konrad in 1964 and continued by Rihard Kenneth Emmerson in 1979) was the form in which he structured the material: he wrote it not in the form of a theological tract or exegetical commentary, which could have been organized by scriptural source, but rather as a hagiography, as a saint's life.&lt;ref name=emmerson/&gt; Medieval hagiographies frequently used anti-types to bring out the virtuous characteristics of their protagonists, and Adso's setup of Antichrist as a chronologically organized biography allowed for an easy contrast with the life of Christ, and thus for easy access to a broad audience.&lt;ref name=maclean/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Richard Kenneth|last=Emmerson|title=Antichrist in the Middle Ages|publisher=U of Washington P|location=Seattle|year=1981|chapter=The Life and Deeds of Antichrist|pages=74-107}}&lt;/ref&gt; The saintly biography is "a form easily understood and readily recognizable by every Christian", and his legend is an anti-legend.&lt;ref name=emmerson&gt;{{cite journal|title=Antichrist as Anti-Saint: The Significance of Abbot Adso's ''Libellus de Antichristo''|first=Richard Kenneth|last=Emerson|journal=[[American Benedictine Review]]|pages=175–90|year=1979|volume=30|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The format did suit the times well, with its love of saintly biography: the biography of Antichrist became a standard entry in many saints' legends, including [[Jacobus de Voragine]]'s ''[[Golden Legend]]'', and it appears very frequently in vernacular legendaries, usually translated from the ''Libellus'' quote closely. In later editions of the letter, the prologue and the epilogue (which named Adso and Gerberga) were frequently cut off (which also makes it resemble a saint's life), and thus the letter was easily attributed to others including [[Rabanus Maurus]], [[Alcuin]], [[Jerome]], and [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]]. Emmerson states there are most likely at least 76 versions in Latin between the 10th and 15th centuries.&lt;ref name=emmerson/&gt; It is quoted by [[Ignaz von Döllinger]] among other writings of the medieval conception of Antichrist. It is printed in ''Corpus Christianorum Continuatio Mediaeualis'' vol 45, edited by D. Verhelst (Turnhout, 1976). The letter and Adso's hagiographies are found in [[Jacques Paul Migne]] (''[[Patrologia Latina]]'', [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k54939630 CXXXVII, 597-700]).&lt;ref name=grey/&gt;

'''Albert Shanker''' (September 14, 1928 – February 22, 1997) was president of the [[United Federation of Teachers]] from 1964 to 1985 and president of the [[American Federation of Teachers]] (AFT) from 1974 to 1997.

==Early life==
Shanker was born on [[Lower East Side|Manhattan’s Lower East Side]] (New York City)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.shankerinstitute.org/about/albert-shanker/ |title=About Albert Shanker |publisher=The Albert Shanker Institute |accessdate=August 13, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120727034952/http://www.shankerinstitute.org/about/albert-shanker/ |archivedate=July 27, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; to a Russian Jewish immigrant family. As a toddler, his family moved to [[Long Island City]], in [[Queens]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uft.org/your-union-then-now/class-struggles-uft-story-part-8 |title=Class struggles: The UFT story, part 8|author= Jack Schiernbeck| publisher= United Federation of Teachers |date=January 13, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His parents, Mamie and Morris Shanker, were emigrants from Poland. Both were union members; his father was a union newspaper deliveryman, and his mother, who operated a sewing-machine in a knitting factory, was a member of the [[Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America]]. The Shanker family's deeply held political views were staunchly pro-union, following the socialism of [[Norman Thomas]] and including ardent support of Franklin Roosevelt and the [[New Deal]]. The experience of watching his mother work 70-hour weeks made Shanker aware from an early age that there was a need for societal changes.

Shanker read several newspapers daily as a young boy, with an interest in philosophy. His idols were [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], [[Clarence Darrow]], civil-rights leader [[Bayard Rustin]], and American philosopher [[Sydney Hook]].&lt;ref name="answers.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/albert-shanker |title=Albert Shanker: Biography from |publisher=Answers.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1946, Shanker graduated from [[Stuyvesant High School]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uft.org/your-union-then-now/class-struggles-uft-story-part-8 |title=Class Struggles: The UFT Story |first=Jack |last=Schierenbeck |date=1996-02-16 |accessdate=2007-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he was the head of the debate team, and went to the [[University of Illinois at Champaign-Urbana]]. He joined the [[Congress of Racial Equality]]. Shanker picketed segregated movie theaters and restaurants and was a member of the [[Young People's Socialist League]] and chairperson of the Socialist Study Club.&lt;ref name="answers.com" /&gt; In 1949, he graduated with honors and enrolled in [[Columbia University]]. In order to earn money while writing his dissertation, Shanker became a substitute teacher at Public School 179 on Manhattan's [[upper West Side]].

==Founding the United Federation of Teachers==
Shanker took a year off after graduating from college and taught mathematics at an East Harlem school from 1952 to 1959. He began his tenure as a union organizer in 1959 to help organize the Teacher's Guild, a New York City affiliate of the [[American Federation of Teachers]] that was founded by [[John Dewey]] in 1917. Eventually, the Teacher's Guild merged with New York City's High School Teacher's Association to form the [[United Federation of Teachers]] (UFT) in 1960. During the 1960s, Shanker received national attention and considerable criticism for his aggressive union leadership and skillful negotiation of salary increases for New York City teachers. He left his teaching job to become a full-time union organizer. He felt that a teachers' union would be more effective if it were united with a common set of goals. In 1964, Shanker succeeded [[Charles Cogen]] as the UFT president, a position he held until 1985. In 1967 and again in 1968, he served jail sentences for leading illegal teachers' strikes. The [[New York City teacher's strike of 1968]] closed down almost all New York City schools for 36 days.

Perhaps Shanker is best known for opposing community-control leaders in the Ocean Hill-Brownsville district of New York City, which led to the [[American Federation of Teachers#Ocean Hill–Brownsville strike|1968 strike]] after white teachers were dismissed from the school district by the recently appointed black administrator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/10/16/assessing-the-legacy-of-albert-shanker-tough-liberal/ |title=Assessing the Legacy of Albert Shanker, Tough Liberal |author= Sewell chan |publisher=New York Times |date=October 16, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/02/24/nyregion/albert-shanker-68-combative-leader-who-transformed-teachers-union-dies.html |title=Albert Shanker, 68, Combative Leader Who Transformed Teachers' Union, Dies |author= Joseph berger |publisher=New York Times |date= February 24, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For more than a decade, Shanker wrote more than 1,300 columns in ''[[The New York Times]]'' and essays in other publications. Accompanied by a small photograph of Shanker, the ''Times'' columns, titled "Where We Stand," sought to clarify the union's position on matters of public interest.

==Activist legacy==
Despite Shanker's organizing efforts and the 15 days that he spent in jail due to his organization activities, he was branded a racist by critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UMcJAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT170&amp;dq=%22Albert+Shanker+anti-semitism%22 |title=The Teacher Wars: A History of America's Most Embattled Profession |publisher=Random House |date= 2014-09-02|accessdate=2015-05-09|isbn=9780385536967 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet he persisted in building the [[United Federation of Teachers]] and was elected president of the [[American Federation of Teachers]] in 1974. He was re-elected every two years until his death.

In 1975, the UFT authorized a five-day strike, leading to allegedly saving New York City from bankruptcy after Shanker asked the Teachers' Retirement System to invest $150 million in municipal bonds.

On September 21, 1981, Shanker had dinner with Leon B. Applewhaite, a personal friend and one of the three members of the [[Federal Labor Relations Authority]] (FLRA). Applewhaite was involved in deciding whether to uphold the decertification of the [[Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization (1968)|Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization]] for the strike they had called in August of that year. During the dinner, Shanker urged Applewhaite not to decertify the [[trade union|union]], an action which plainly violated the prohibition on the ''[[ex parte]]'' contact contained in the federal [[Administrative Procedure Act (United States)|Administrative Procedure Act]]. Although the contact was not ultimately found to have legal consequences, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit|D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals]] criticized Shanker's behavior in their review of the FLRA's decision. (See 685 F.2d 547.)

In 1988, Shanker was the first to propose charter schools in the U.S. He was inspired by a visit to a public school in Cologne, Germany, in which teams of teachers had considerable control over how the school was run, and about what and how to teach. They stayed with each class of students for six years. The schools were integrated by ethnic and economic origins, and were originally intended to focus on the neediest students, drop-outs and those most likely to drop out soon.&lt;ref name="nybooks.com"&gt;[http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2010/nov/11/myth-charter-schools/?pagination=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, Shanker turned against the charter school idea when he realized that for-profit organizations saw it as a business opportunity and were advancing an agenda of school privatization.&lt;ref name="nybooks.com"/&gt; Indeed, the charter schools that were finally established in the U.S. were different from Shanker's vision. "On average, charter schools are even more racially and economically segregated than traditional public schools," according to an opinion piece in the ''New York Times'' explaining Shanker's views.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/31/opinion/sunday/albert-shanker-the-original-charter-school-visionary.html The Original Charter School Vision], By RICHARD D. KAHLENBERG and HALLEY POTTER, New York Times, AUG. 30, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Opponents of the Vietnam war have criticized Shanker and other AFL-CIO leaders for supporting the war in Vietnam and other anti-Communist aspects of U.S. foreign policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Paul |last=Buhle |title=Albert Shanker: No flowers |publisher=[[New Politics (magazine)|New Politics]] |url=http://www.wpunj.edu/newpol/issue23/buhle23.htm |year=1997 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080218033150/http://www.wpunj.edu/newpol/issue23/buhle23.htm |archivedate=February 18, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cup.columbia.edu/book/978-0-231-13496-5/tough-liberal/excerpt |title=Tough Liberal |publisher=Cup.columbia.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-08-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140821093542/http://cup.columbia.edu/book/978-0-231-13496-5/tough-liberal/excerpt |archivedate=2014-08-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later years==
Shanker was a visiting professor at [[Hunter College]] and [[Harvard University]] during the 1980s. He continued to work toward organizing teachers throughout his life and attempted to bridge the AFT with the [[National Education Association]], which he never saw happen. In 1991, U.S. President [[George H. W. Bush]] appointed him as a member of the original [[Competitiveness Policy Council]].

Shanker died of [[bladder cancer]] and was posthumously awarded the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] in 1998 by U.S. President [[Bill Clinton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.senate.gov/pagelayout/reference/two_column_table/Presidential_Medal_of_Freedom_Recipients.htm|title=Presidential Medal of Freedom Recipients|publisher=[[United States Senate]]|accessdate=2007-07-26| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070725233841/http://senate.gov/pagelayout/reference/two_column_table/Presidential_Medal_of_Freedom_Recipients.htm| archivedate= 25 July 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Quotations==
"Public schools played a big role in holding our nation together. They brought together children of different races, languages, religions, and cultures and gave them a common language and a sense of common purpose. We have not outgrown our need for this; far from it." ("Where We Stand," March 3, 1997)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nysut.org/shanker/ |title=Al Shanker. The "Where We Stand" Archive |publisher=Nysut.org |date= |accessdate=2014-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"There is no more reason to pay for private education than there is to pay for a private swimming pool for those who do not use public facilities."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,922884,00.html | work=Time | title=A Boost for Private Schools | date=April 26, 1982 | accessdate=April 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"It is as much the duty of the union to preserve public education as it is to negotiate a good contract."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aft.org/pdfs/teachers/wwsrsrabooklet0806.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-01-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140316205410/http://www.aft.org/pdfs/teachers/wwsrsrabooklet0806.pdf |archivedate=2014-03-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"It's dangerous to let a lot of ideas out of the bag, some of which may be bad. But there's something that's more dangerous, and that's not having any new ideas at all at a time when the world is closing in on you." (Speech to the AFT QuEST Conference, 1985)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ashankerinst.org/aboutal.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513180447/http://www.ashankerinst.org/aboutal.html |date=May 13, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disputed quote==

The quote,
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"When schoolchildren start paying union dues, that’s when I’ll start representing the interests of school children."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2011/06/the-failure-of-american-schools/8497/ The Failure of American Schools], By Joel Klein, Atlantic Magazine, June 2011&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

is often attributed to Shanker.

The Albert Shanker Institute attempted to find the source of this quote, and concluded that "we cannot demonstrate conclusively that Albert Shanker never made this particular statement... but, we believe the quote is fiction." The first appearance, which those at the Institute could find, was in the ''Meridian (Mississippi) Star'' newspaper, August 13, 1985, but no source is included in the article.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://shankerblog.org/?p=2562 |title=Quote, Unquote |publisher=Shanker Blog |date= |accessdate=2014-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
*There is a reference to Albert Shanker in the [[Woody Allen]] movie ''[[Sleeper (1973 film)|Sleeper]]'' ([[1973 in film|1973]]).&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uft.org/who-we-are/history/albert-shanker |title=Albert Shanker &amp;#124; United Federation of Teachers |publisher=Uft.org |date= |accessdate=2014-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The protagonist is transported to the future, where he is told that the old world was destroyed when "a man named Albert Shanker got hold of a nuclear warhead."

'''Benjamin Franklin Smallwood''' (1829-December 15, 1891) was Principal Chief of the [[Choctaw Nation]] from 1888 to 1890. From 1847 to 1890, Smallwood held public office in Choctaw Nation, except for the time he served as an officer in the [[United States Civil War|Civil War]].

==Early life==
He was born in 1829 in Choctaw Nation to William and Mary (LeFore) Smallwood in Choctaw Nation in [[Mississippi]].&lt;ref name="Littlefield"&gt;Littlefield, Daniel F., and James W. Parins. ''A Biobibliography of Native American Writers, 1772-1924: A Supplement'', Scarecrow Press, 1895. p. 286-287.&lt;/ref&gt; When he was a young child, his family moved to [[Indian Territory]] on the [[Choctaw Trail of Tears]].&lt;ref name="Meserve"&gt;Meserve, John Bartlett. [http://digital.library.okstate.edu/Chronicles/v019/v019p213.html "Chief Benjamin Franklin Smallwood and Chief Jefferson Gardner,"] ''Chronicles of Oklahoma'', Volume 19, No. 3, September, 1941.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="national-register-nom"&gt;{{cite document

As a child, Smallwood attended [[Spencer Academy]] in Choctaw Nation.&lt;ref name="Littlefield"/&gt;

==Political career==
Smallwood began his political career in 1847, when he served as a ranger in [[Kiamichi County]].&lt;ref name="Meserve"/&gt; Also beginning in 1847, he held the office of representative to the Choctaw Council.&lt;ref name="national-register-nom"/&gt; In his subsequent career, he served as speaker of the lower house and delegate to [[Washington, D.C.]]&lt;ref name="Littlefield"/&gt; As delegate to Washington, he was responsible for negotiating agreements between the Choctaw and the United States government.&lt;ref&gt;''Native Peoples A to Z: A Reference Guide to Native Peoples of the Western Hemisphere'', Native American Book Publishers, 2009. Volume 8, p.2188.&lt;/ref&gt;

He ran for Principal Chief in 1886 as candidate for the National Party but was defeated by Progressive Party candidate [[Thompson McKinney]].&lt;ref name="Meserve"/&gt; In 1888, he was again the National Party's candidate for Principal Chief, this time running against Progressive candidate [[Wilson Nathaniel Jones]].&lt;ref name="Meserve"/&gt; Because of his long career in the house of representatives, he was popular enough to win the election  even though the Progressive Party won the majority of seats in both houses of the Choctaw Council.&lt;ref name="Meserve"/&gt; Because the chief and the council represented different parties, Smallwood was able to accomplish little politically during his years in office.&lt;ref name="Meserve"/&gt;

Politically, Smallwood was very concerned about maintaining the independence of Choctaw Nation and resisting interference from the U.S. Government.&lt;ref name="Meserve"/&gt; He was troubled by the establishment of a federal court in Indian Territory&lt;ref&gt;Mihesuah, Devon Abbott, ''Choctaw Crime and Punishment, 1884-1907'', University of Oklahoma Press: Norman, Oklahoma, 2012, p.60.&lt;/ref&gt; and a law authorizing appeals to the United States authority on matters of Choctaw citizenship after a Choctaw court decision had already been made.&lt;ref name="Meserve"/&gt; He also refused to allow the incorporation of towns established by whites who had moved into Choctaw nation.&lt;ref name="national-register-nom"/&gt; These towns, which included [[Krebs, Oklahoma|Krebs]] and [[Lehigh, Oklahoma|Lehigh]] lacked official status and public services, including water and sewer systems and fire and police protections.&lt;ref name="national-register-nom"/&gt;

Important political meetings of Choctaw legislators, religious leaders, and members of the [[United States Congress]] were held at Smallwood's home on his ranch near Lehigh, the [[Benjamin Franklin Smallwood House]]. This was because Smallwood would not meet with representatives of the U.S. government unless they came to his house.&lt;ref name="national-register-nom"/&gt;

In 1888, the U.S. Government made a payment to Choctaw Nation, and Smallwood called a special session of the Council, which authorized that the funds were to be dispersed without an audit by the Net Proceeds Commission.&lt;ref name="Meserve"/&gt; The payment was for the Leased District, which was originally owned by the Choctaw but had been granted to the United States by treaty in 1855.&lt;ref name="May"&gt;May, Jon D. [http://www.okhistory.org/publications/enc/entry.php?entry=LE002 "Leased District,"] ''Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture'', Oklahoma Historical Society, Accessed July 4, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Smallwood himself pocketed $5,500 of the funds.&lt;ref name="Meserve"/&gt; According to Meserve in the ''Chronicles of Oklahoma'', this "constitutes one of the dark pages in Choctaw history."&lt;ref name="Meserve"/&gt;

He ran for reelection in 1890 but was defeated by Wilson Nathaniel Jones.&lt;ref&gt;May, Jon D. [http://www.okhistory.org/publications/enc/entry.php?entry=JO023 "Jones, Wilson Nathaniel,"] ''Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture'', Oklahoma Historical Society, Accessed July 4, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

During his time in office, Smallwood had advocated for the expansion of Choctaw schools, but due to the divisive political situation, he made little progress.&lt;ref name="Meserve"/&gt; Jones and the new council nonetheless followed his recommendations and added more schools, though Smallwood received no credit.&lt;ref name="Meserve"/&gt;

==Civil War Service==
During the [[United States Civil War]], Smallwood was Captain of the [[Choctaw in the American Civil War|2nd Choctaw Regiment]] in the [[Confederate States Army|Confederate Army]].&lt;ref name="Meserve"/&gt;

==Business and Ranching==
Smallwood first opened a store in Kiamichi County in 1862.&lt;ref name="Meserve"/&gt; The next year, he moved to Lehigh.&lt;ref name="Meserve"/&gt;  Smallwood owned a farm near Lehigh, raised cattle, and ran a dry goods store in town.&lt;ref name="Dary"&gt;Dary, David. ''Stories of Old Time Oklahoma'', University of Oklahoma Press: Norman, Oklahoma, 2015. p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[sandstone]] house on his ranch, constructed in 1875, is known as the [[Benjamin Franklin Smallwood House]].&lt;ref name="national-register-nom"/&gt; It was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1982.&lt;ref name="OK-Register-Handbook"&gt;State Historic Preservation Office: Oklahoma Historical Society.[http://www.okhistory.org/shpo/NRHANDBK.htm ''Oklahoma's National Register Handbook'']. April 1, 2015. Accessed July 2, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Retirement==
After being defeated for reelection, Smallwood retired to his home near Lehigh, where he died on December 15, 1891.&lt;ref name="Meserve"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Littlefield"/&gt;

==Personal life==
In 1849, Smallwood married Annie Burney, a [[Chickasaw]] from the house of Ima-te-po of the family of Okla-pa-nubbii.&lt;ref name="Meserve"/&gt; Annie died during the Civil War. Smallwood later married Abbie James.&lt;ref name="Littlefield"/&gt;

He was also one of the chief founders and head instructors of [[Bakbakan International]] and the eldest brother of the action star [[Ronnie Ricketts]].  

==History and experience==
Christopher Ricketts was a well-known [[martial artist]] in the Philippines, Australia, and the United States. "Topher", as he was called by his peers, was an experienced tournament (both full-contact and point system) and street fighter. He was known for his strict emphasis on using basics and frequent contact sparring. Topher had trained champions, many of whom have become part of Philippine teams in Asian and international competitions. Apart from being Chief Instructor for Bakbakan, Topher had assisted his brother [[Ronnie Ricketts]], a Philippine action star, in choreographing action scenes in many movies. He also acted in a few of them as supporting roles. Numerous Bakbakan members have played cameo roles in Ronnie's movies, lending credibility to the action sequences as well as drawing crowds to the theatersuse of the authentic fight scenes. 

==Personal life==
Christopher "Topher" Ricketts was born and raised in Manila, Philippines. He married Ma. Elizabeth Mercado and had three sons Bruce Edward, Brandon Max and Christopher Joseph. "Topher" and his family relocated and moved to San Diego, California around 2005.

==Notoriety==
Along with Rey Galang, Christopher "Topher" Ricketts was a founder and a major contributor behind the [[Bakbakan]] organization. He gained exposure in 1986 from a project called "''Masters of Arnis''", which also featured [[Rey Galang]], Antonio Diego and [[Edgar Sulite]]. They toured Sydney and Melbourne, Australia giving seminars on the Filipino Martial Arts, particularly those taught as the Bakbakan curriculum. This international exposure for [[Bakbakan]] triggered several articles in mainstream martial arts magazines. Since then, he had collaborated with Antonio Diego on a book about the art of one of his primary teachers, [[Antonio "Tatang" Ilustrisimo]].

==Death==
He succumbed to cancer in [[San Diego]], [[California]] on October 5, 2010 at the age of 55.&lt;ref name=myfma /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3131">'''Dial Duwayne Ryder''' (June 12, 1938 &amp;ndash; October 20, 2011) was an American [[gunsmith]].

==The Assassination of President John Kennedy==
Ryder worked at the [[Irving, Texas]] Sports Shop and stated that he possessed a record of [[Lee Harvey Oswald]]'s name. The [[Warren Commission]], which investigated the [[assassination of John F. Kennedy]], looked into a report that Oswald had a telescopic sight mounted and sighted at the store in which Ryder was employed. Ryder showed agents of the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]], on November 25, 1963, a tag which he claimed was in Oswald's handwriting.&lt;ref name=voll/&gt; The undated tag, with the name ''OSWALD'',&lt;ref&gt;''Who's Who In The JFK Assassination: An A-To-Z Encyclopedia'', Michael Benson, [[Citadel Press]], 1993, 159.&lt;/ref&gt; attested that three holes had been drilled into an unspecified kind of rifle. Further, a telescopic sight had been mounted on the rifle and boresighted.&lt;ref name=lee/&gt; The customer paid $4.50 for drilling and $1.50 for boresighting the rifle.&lt;ref name=gus&gt;''Oswald: Assassin or Fall Guy'', Joachen Joesten, the Merlin Press Ltd., [[London, England]], 1964, 75.&lt;/ref&gt;

Neither Dial or his employer, Charles W. Greener, believed that they had worked on the gun.&lt;ref name=voll&gt;''President John F. Kennedy: Assassination Report of the Warren Commission'', [[Gerald Ford]] Signed Edition, June 30, 2005, 221.&lt;/ref&gt; Dial told author Leo Sauvage the rifle Oswald ordered from [[Chicago, Illinois]] came equipped with a [[telescopic sight]]. He elaborated, saying that the rifle with the undated tag must have been another weapon than the one Oswald received by mail,&lt;ref name=lee/&gt; in March 1963.&lt;ref name=gus/&gt; Dial stated ''either  it was another rifle or another Oswald.''&lt;ref name=lee&gt;''The Oswald Affair'', Leo Sauvage, [[World Publishing Company]], 1966, 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ryder believed that a close inspection of the 6.5&amp;nbsp;mm [[Mannlicher Carcano]] owned by Oswald would reveal that neither he or  his shop worked on the gun.&lt;ref&gt;''Gunsmith Attached Sight for Man Named Oswald'', [[New York Times]], November 29, 1963, 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Ryder was born in [[Claremont, Illinois]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brownmem.com/book-of-memories/1066653/Ryder-Dial/obituary.php?Printable=true Dial Duwayne Ryder-obituary]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1945, Ryder moved with his family to Irving, Texas and graduated from [[Irving High School]]. He served in the Texas National Guard and the United States Army.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mcadams.posc.mu.edu/russ/testimony/ryder.htm Testimony of Dial Duwayne Ryder-Warren Commission]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Elmer Merrifield Keith''' (March 8, 1899 &amp;ndash; February 14, 1984&lt;ref&gt;{{Find a Grave|27813889|Elmer Merrifield Keith}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was an [[Idaho]] [[rancher]], [[firearm]]s enthusiast, and author.  Keith was instrumental in the development of the first magnum revolver cartridge, the [[.357 Magnum]], as well as the later [[.44 Magnum]] and [[.41 Magnum]] cartridges, credited by Roy G. Jinks as "the father of big bore handgunning."&lt;ref&gt;''Gresham, Grits''. Grits on Guns, Cane River Publishing, 1987, p. 294, {{ISBN|0-944438-00-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personality and life==
Keith's trademarks were his cigars, his [[Stetson]], and his outspoken opinions.  Keith was an avid handgun hunter in the earliest days of the sport, and often hunted medium game with a [[Trigger (firearms)#Double-action|double action]] [[Smith &amp; Wesson]] revolver.  In the days when handgun cartridges tended to fire large, slow bullets like the popular [[.45 Colt]], or light, fast bullets like the [[7.63×25mm Mauser|.30 Mauser]], Keith was pushing the limits of existing cartridges, driving large bullets at high velocities.

He was married to Loraine Randall. Elmer Keith was born near Hardin, Missouri but was raised in Montana, Idaho, and eastern Oregon. In the 1930s and early 1940s, he had a ranch on the North Fork of the Salmon River near [[Salmon, Idaho]]. In the late 1940s, Elmer and Loraine left the ranch and moved into the town of Salmon. [The ranch is still owned by the Keith family.]

During World War II, Keith served as an inspector at the Ogden, Utah Arsenal.  The rifles that he inspected were [[cartouche]] stamped with the initials "OGEK"  in a rectangular box, on the buttstock. Rifles stamped OGEK without a rectangular box were inspected by [[Ed Klouser]] at the same Ogden Arsenal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Inspectors Stamps|url=http://m1903.com/isstamps.htm|publisher=m1903.com|accessdate=24 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''The Phantom Of Phu Bai'', a biography of USMC Scout Sniper [[Eric England (sniper)|Eric England]] written by Dr. Joseph B. Turner, one chapter is about Elmer Keith and his influence on the shooting community.

==Magnum revolvers==
Keith's first major contribution, the .357 Magnum, was the result of [[handloading]] the [[.38 Special]] cartridge far beyond normally accepted limits, taking full advantage of the greater strength of the revolvers available in the 1920s compared to those of the late 19th century.  The .357 Magnum first became available in 1935 and quickly became a favorite among law enforcement and civilian users.  The .357 Magnum had a slightly longer case than the .38 Special, but was otherwise identical, so .357 Magnum revolvers could shoot .38 Special or .357 Magnum ammunition, but .38 Special revolvers (most of which are not safe for the pressures generated by the Magnum round) could not chamber .357 Magnum ammunition.  Buying a .357 Magnum revolver gave the shooter all the abilities of the well-established .38 Special, with the ability to double the available power by using the Magnum cartridge. Keith's contributions to the commercial development of the .357 Magnum have been questioned by some writers, and Keith subsequently denigrated the .357 Magnum as he had the .38 Special.

The .44 Magnum was developed in much the same way, and was released commercially in 1956. Keith had earlier determined that the thinner chamber walls of the .45 Colt would not comfortably withstand the pressures generated by his own heavy loads. He therefore started experimenting with the .44 Special revolver, and used the same formula of pushing heavy bullets at high velocities that he had used for the .357 Magnum.  The resulting ".44  Special Magnum" was a formidable cartridge for handgun hunting, firing a 250 grain bullet at {{convert|1200|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}}.

Keith encouraged [[Smith &amp; Wesson]] and [[Remington Arms|Remington]] to produce a commercial version of this new high pressure loading, and revolvers chambered for it. While S&amp;W produced the first prototype revolver chambered in .44 Magnum, the famous Model 29, [[Sturm, Ruger]] actually beat S&amp;W to market by several months in 1956 with a .44 Magnum version of the single action [[Ruger Blackhawk|Blackhawk]] revolver. In fact Remington delivered a more powerful cartridge than Keith asked for, firing a 240 grain bullet at {{convert|1500|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}}, and it remained the most powerful production handgun cartridge until the commercial introduction of the [[.454 Casull]] (based on the [[.45 Colt]]).  The .44 Magnum is still far more popular, as the recoil of .454 Casull rounds is considered excessive by most shooters, and revolvers in .454 Casull were rare and expensive until the introduction of .454 Casull models by [[Sturm, Ruger]] and [[Taurus (manufacturer)|Taurus]] in the late 1990s.

The .41 Magnum, released in 1963, was an attempt to reach a middle ground between the .357 and .44 magnums.  The .357 Magnum was adequate for hunting deer-sized game, but the limited power meant it needed to be used by a skilled marksman.  The .44 Magnum provided far more power, easily taking deer-sized game, but recoil and muzzle blast are substantial, at least in the earliest commercial loadings.  The .41 Magnum, inspired by the older, obsolete [[.41 Long Colt]] cartridge, was intended to provide more power than the .357 Magnum with less recoil and muzzle blast than the .44 Magnum.  The .41 Magnum used a completely new case (unlike the .357 Magnum and .44 Magnum which were based on existing cases), and used a .410" bullet instead of the earlier .41 Colt and [[.38-40]]'s roughly .400" diameter bullet, while pushing the new .410" bullet to similar velocities as achieved by the .357 and .44 Magnum bullets.  However, while there was (and still is) a small community of shooters preferring the .41 Magnum, the round failed to achieve a similar high degree of popularity.  Some police, to whom the .41 Magnum was initially marketed, were happy with the .38 Special or .357 Magnum, and many officers had no interest in anything more powerful, and which also delivered  greater blast and recoil that could place the shooter at a disadvantage in a gunfight requiring fast follow-up shots. Some police departments adopted the 41 Mag with a reduced load designed for police use, and were quite happy the added power required only one hit to put an opponent down. Thus the 41 Magnum saved many officer's lives who were lucky enough to use them{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}. Hunters likewise stayed with the more commonly available .44 Magnum, which could be used with full power factory loads, less powerful handloads, or commercial .44 Special ammunition as needed.

Keith regarded the handgun as a weapon of opportunity. He had plenty of opportunities to use his sixgun on game during his life. He was incredibly skilled with handguns. He shot at a rifle-wounded deer and hit it several times at a range of {{convert|600|yards|m|adj=off}} using his 6½&amp;nbsp;inch [[S&amp;W Model 29]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.handloads.com/articles/default.asp?id=34 Elmer Keith's 600 yard shot]&lt;/ref&gt; It is currently part of the Keith collection with the factory standard {{convert|4|in|mm|adj=on}} barrel length that he more commonly carried. The Keith firearm collection has been dispersed, having been sold individually at auction by James D. Julia in March 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jamesdjulia.com/373_shs/|title=James D. Julia, Inc.|accessdate=August 31, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Keith is also famous for designing and commissioning his No. 5 revolver, fashioned by R. F. Sedgeley, in 1928.

==Keith-style bullets==
Keith was also responsible for a number of bullet designs still popular today, and collectively called "Keith style" bullets.  These bullets were based on the [[semiwadcutter]] (SWC) design, but using a wider than normal front surface, and convex sides.  These changes increased the volume of the bullet ''outside'' the case, thus allowing more room ''inside'' the case, needed for large loads of slower burning powders (see [[internal ballistics]]).  These bullets remain popular for both target shooting and hunting.  When shooting paper targets, they cut a relatively clean hole in the target, yet provide more case volume and a better [[ballistic coefficient]] than a flat front wadcutter.  When used for hunting, the heavy bullets provide excellent penetration; they are often used on dangerous game, for which more reliable penetration is required than is possible with expanding [[hollow point bullet|hollow point]] or [[soft point bullet]]s.

[[File:Keith-Style-45-SWC.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Keith-Style SWC]]Originally Keith specified a [[meplat]] that was 65% of the bullet caliber, but later increased it to a 70% meplat.  The other distinguishing characteristics of a "Keith-style" SWC are a double radius ogive, beveled crimp groove, three equal width driving bands, wide square bottomed grease groove, and a plain base with sharp corners.  The wide forward driving band helps keep the bullet aligned as it jumps across the cylinder gap.  Because of the three wide equal width driving bands, the total bearing surface is half the length of the bullet.  The relatively large bearing surface helps the Keith-style SWC to be an inherently accurate bullet, and minimizes leading from gas blow-by.  The wide square bottom grease groove holds ample lubricant.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lasc.us/Fryxell_Book_Chapter_12_KeithSWC.htm From Ingot to Target: A Cast Bullet Guide for Handgunners© Chapter 12: The Keith Semiwadcutter (SWC)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work with rifles==
Keith was instrumental in the development of various wildcat cartridges, a few of which were later adopted as factory rounds. The .333 OKH ("O'Neil-Keith-Hopkins"), developed in conjunction with Charlie O'Neil and Don Hopkins, was made from [[.30-06 Springfield]] brass necked up to take the .333" 250 and 300-grain bullets of the [[.333 Jeffery]]. There was also a .334 OKH,&lt;ref&gt;Frank C. Barnes, Holt Bodinson, Cartridges of the World: A Complete and Illustrated Reference for Over 1500 Cartridges Cartridges of the World, {{ISBN|978-0-89689-936-0}}, S. 198,66&lt;/ref&gt; based on the shortened [[.300 H&amp;H Magnum]] case. The .333 OKH, necked up slightly to take the more common .338" sized bullets of the older [[.33 Winchester]], led to the creation of the popular [[Wildcat cartridge]] the [[.338-06]], also known as the 338 OKH, and was the inspiration for the 1958 commercial introduction of the [[.338 Winchester Magnum]] based on the larger belted [[.458 Winchester Magnum]] case. The .334 OKH, likewise necked up to accept .338" bullets and given the distinctive [[Weatherby]] "double-radius" shoulder, was introduced by [[Weatherby]] in 1963 as the [[.340 Weatherby Magnum]]. The [[.338-378 Weatherby Magnum]], introduced in 1998, was developed based on another one of Keith's wildcats, the .338-378 KT(Keith-Thomson), which he developed in the 1960s with Bob Thomson.

An admirer of the old British [[double rifle]]s, Keith had numerous examples in his collection. He used two of these doubles, a .476 [[Westley Richards]] and a .500 [[Nitro Express]], to take dangerous game in Africa on two different safaris. Keith documented the first of these hunts in his 1968 tome, ''Safari''.

== Published works ==

Keith was a prolific writer, writing both books and magazine columns. During the 1950s and 1960s, he was especially well known for his regular monthly columns he wrote for ''[[Guns&amp;nbsp;&amp;&amp;nbsp;Ammo]]'' magazine and ''American Rifleman'' typically exploring the performance of the latest new gun offerings, especially those firing large, heavy bullets pushed to high velocities.  He has influenced modern gun writers such as [[Mike Venturino]] and [[John Taffin]].&lt;ref&gt;

}}'''Frank Weston Sandford''' (October 2, 1862 – March 4, 1948)&lt;ref name="autogenerated1989"&gt;Shirley Nelson, ''Fair Clear and Terrible: The Story of Shiloh, Maine'' (Latham, New York: British American Publishing, 1989), 27. A second edition (Eugene, OR: Wipf &amp; Stock, 2016) includes references and an index.&lt;/ref&gt; was an American [[Clergy|religious leader]], preacher, and [[Fundamentalism|religious extremist]], who attained notoriety during the [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostal Era]] as the founder and leader of "[[Frank Sandford#Shiloh|The Kingdom]]".

Sanford was born in [[Bowdoinham, Maine|Bowdoinham]], Maine to a farming family. In his thirties, he gained exposure to [[premillennialism]], the [[Higher Life movement]], the indwelling power of the [[Holy Spirit]], and [[divine healing]]. In August 1891, after executing a successful [[exorcism]] and hearing the voice of god in a forest warn him of "[[Armageddon]]", he established a [[supernatural]] closed commune called [[Frank Sandford#Shiloh|the "Shiloh"]] in [[Durham, Maine|Durham]], Maine. Commune members were forced to [[Prayer|pray]] hours-on-end, [[Fasting|fast]], and obey his orders absolutely. After commune members disagreed about his [[Biblical hermeneutics|biblical interpretations]] he instituted a chain-of-command where he ruled limited by only God and [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]]. After a final divine intervention, he declared himself the [[Incarnation (Christianity)|earthly incarnation]] of prophits [[Elijah]] and King [[David]], and founded "The Kingdom"–an [[Apocalypticism|apocalyptic]] Christian sect.

Considered by former members and many neighbors to be an [[Autocracy|autocrat]] who insisted on unquestioning loyalty, Sandford regularly starved his followers causing deadly outbreaks of [[smallpox]], [[diphtheria]], and other infectious diseases. The death of 14-year-old Leander Bartlett lead to his conviction of [[manslaughter]] and [[Child abuse|cruelty to children]] in 1904. Due to religious laws at the time, a 1905 [[Maine Supreme Judicial Court|Maine Supreme Court]] ruling reversed his convictions. After the ruling, he sailed to [[Jerusalem]] on multiple missionary voyages. In 1910, he traveled aboard the ''Kingdom'', to [[Africa]] with more than seventy men, women, and children. In March 1911, the ''Kingdom'' went aground and was destroyed off the coast of [[French West Africa]] which inspired Sandford to sail to [[Greenland]] to create a [[Mission (station)|mission station]]. Knowingly sailing without sufficient food or supplies, six crew members contracted [[scurvy]] and died upon his return to [[Portland, Maine|Portland]].

He was detained by authorities upon docking and sentenced to seven years in [[United States Penitentiary, Atlanta|Atlanta U.S. Penitentiary]]. While he was in prison, letters sent to his followers were reprinted en masse and distributed among the commune. In 1918, he was released on good behavior and returned to the "Shiloh", resuming his responsibilities after previously attempting to install his son, John, as leader. However, two years later, the death of another commune member saw to "[[Frank Sandford#The Scattering|The Scattering]]". After the commune was [[wikt:evacuation|evacuated by law]], he moved to New York's [[Catskill Mountains]] to be closer to God. On March 4, 1948, Sandford died, which prompted his body to be secretly buried by followers, and all of his belongings burned in various [[Structure fire|house fires]]. His absence retarded the growth of his small sect; but it survived, in [[wiktionary:attenuation|attenuated]] form, into the 21st century with the creation of the Kingdom Christian Ministries in 1998.

==Early life and education==
Sandford was born in [[Bowdoinham, Maine]], the tenth child of a farming family.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1989"/&gt; As a young man Frank was a natural leader.  An early companion recalled that he was always the one who "drove the horse and steered the boat"; if they played ball, "he was always a captain."&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, 30.&lt;/ref&gt; His father died when Frank was fourteen, and by sixteen he was teaching school during an era in which physical prowess was often necessary to establish classroom discipline.&lt;ref&gt;Sandford "learned to get boiling mad with effect—to use his anger to control his circumstances.  It worked in a total of seven schools....Work was more fun when he was in charge.  His pupils adored him for that.  If he was angry, his voice roaring, they did what he said in a hurry.  The result was diligence—and immense pride and elation when they pleased him." Hiss, 42-43; Nelson, 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

During his second year of teaching, Sandford reluctantly attended a revival meeting at his mother's Free Baptist church and was converted on February 29, 1880. He threw away his tobacco and announced his conversion publicly, not only at church but also at [[Nichols Latin School]], where worldly cosmopolitanism was the preferred pose.&lt;ref&gt;Hiss, 44-45; Murray, 33-39. Sandford said he had been struck by the words of an old man who said, "Lord, you know we have no promise of the morrow." Sandford returned the next night and was converted. Nichols was a preparatory school for Bates College and shared its campus. Although the schools were Free Baptist, the student newspaper reported drinking bouts and vandalism, and Sandford was shunned as a "self-righteous humbug."&lt;/ref&gt;

Entering [[Bates College]] on a general scholarship, Sandford was elected class president and served as both coach and catcher of the baseball team.&lt;ref&gt;The ''Lewiston Journal'' wrote of "old reliable Sandord," who suffered repeated dislocations of his fingers as a catcher because mitts were unpadded. Sandford's left hand was "gnarled and crooked for life." Hiss, 47.&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated in 1886 with honors and was chosen to give a commencement address.  For a summer he captained a semi-pro baseball team and was approached by professional scouts.  After a teammate ridiculed him for attending church on the annual State of Maine Fast Day, Sandford returned to Bates to attend [[Cobb Divinity School]].&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, 34-36; Hiss, 50-52. In 1911, the New York Times claimed that Sandford was "one of, if not the greatest college catchers Maine ever saw" and averred that had he "stuck to professional baseball he might have been the idol of thousands of big league fans." ''New York Times'', [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9C0CE5DF1E31E233A2575AC2A9669D946096D6CF October 29, 1911.] Another report likely exaggerated his prowess when it claimed Sandford played his entire senior year without an error. Hiss, 47.&lt;/ref&gt;

Frustrated by the seminary's mixture of formalism and [[Liberal Christianity|religious modernism]], Sandford later said that God had addressed him directly with words from the gospel of Matthew, "Blessed are they that hunger and thirst after righteousness, for they shall be filled." For the rest of his life he distrusted academic religion.&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, 36-37; Hiss, 52; Matthew 5: 6. Sandford said that this occasion was the first on which God had spoken to him directly.&lt;/ref&gt; Soon thereafter the twenty-four-year-old dropped out of seminary after he was called as pastor by the Freewill Baptist church in [[Topsham, Maine]].&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, 37-38.&lt;/ref&gt; Sandford was frenetically energetic, and within three years his revivals resulted in three hundred conversions and more than a hundred baptisms. Besides serving as pastor, he became principal of the Topsham schools and organized sports programs for both local children and workers at a paper mill.&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, 38. Hiss, 53.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early travels==
Beginning in 1887, Sandford's religious views changed dramatically. In July, he attended [[Dwight L. Moody]]’s "College of Colleges" at [[Northfield Mount Hermon School]] in [[Northfield, Massachusetts]], the second annual meeting of the [[Student Volunteer Movement]].&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, 45.&lt;/ref&gt; The college men who attended represented a revival of interest in foreign missions among more privileged Americans.&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, 45-46.  The motto of the Student Volunteer Movement was the "evangelization of the world in this generation."&lt;/ref&gt; Moody himself provided Sandford with three important religious ideas: personal holiness, living by faith, and informal preaching.&lt;ref&gt;Hiss, 63.  Moody also rested on Saturdays and held a year-end watch service, both practices that Sandford adopted.&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly thereafter, Sandford read [[Hannah Whitall Smith]]'s, ''The Christian's Secret of a Happy Life'' (1875).&lt;ref&gt;Hiss, 63-64; Nelson, 41-44.&lt;/ref&gt; Smith was an exponent of [[Higher Life movement|"higher life"]] Christianity; but what most attracted Sandford was Smith's "emphasis on action, on a life that acts on faith, that obeys by doing."&lt;ref&gt;Hiss, 67; ''Everlasting Gospel'', (June 1–30, 1901), 177.&lt;/ref&gt;

Later that fall Sandford was present for a religious conference that featured the Rev. [[Albert Benjamin Simpson|A. B. Simpson]], who had come to Maine specifically to organize the [[Christian and Missionary Alliance]].  Simpson's ministry  emphasized not only missions and deeper life holiness but also [[faith healing]]. (At the latter meeting Sandford also met Helen Kinney, the daughter of a wealthy cotton broker, who had surrendered a career in art to become a foreign missionary.)&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, 47-48.&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, in the summer of 1888, Sandford attended the [[Niagara Bible Conference]], which emphasized the imminent, [[premillennialism|premillennial]] return of Christ.&lt;ref&gt;Hiss, 69-70; Nelson, 49-50; David O. Beale, ''In Pursuit of Purity: American Fundamentalism since 1850'' (Greenville, SC: Bob Jones University Press, 1986), 22-29&lt;/ref&gt;

These diverse, yet related, strands of late 19th-century evangelicalism came together for Sandford after he accepted the pastorate of a more affluent Free Baptist Church in [[Somersworth, New Hampshire]].  Following a period of emotional depression—perhaps a nervous breakdown—he was temporarily released by his church after the denomination invited him and another young minister to travel around the world.&lt;ref&gt;In an interview with Hiss, Frank Murray remembered Sandford saying that he had had "a nervous breakdown, but God wouldn't let me give way to it." Hiss, 80. Sandford's church underwrote part of Sandford's cost for the round-the-world trip.&lt;/ref&gt; Sandford visited Japan, China, India, Egypt, and Palestine.  In China he toured the [[China Inland Mission]] of [[Hudson Taylor]], where he noted with admiration that "all depend upon God for support and divide their supplies equally"—a model for his own Shiloh.&lt;ref&gt;Hiss, 84. Sandford said that he left Taylor's mission "with a burning desire in my heart to see our own work multiply and spread under just such a system of simple reliance upon God."&lt;/ref&gt; Visiting the Holy Land, Sandford developed a lifelong passion for more knowledge about it, but he nearly died when his steamer sank off [[Jaffa]].&lt;ref&gt;Hiss, 80-88; Nelson, 51-54. Sandford became a lasting friend of the Muslim chief boatman who had pulled him to safety despite "the religious gulf between them." Hiss, 88.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pre-Shiloh activities==
After his return to America, the pastorate seemed tame, his congregation narrow-minded.  In August 1891, Sandford had two strange experiences: he tentatively, but (at least according to his own testimony) successfully, cast [[demons]] out of a friend; and the following morning, he heard whispered in the trees the single word, "[[Armageddon]]." Shortly thereafter, Sandford convinced Helen Kinney, whom he had met again as a missionary in Japan, to marry him.  When he suggested leaving the pastorate and preaching the gospel without visible support, she replied, "I think it would be lovely."&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, 54-58. Nevertheless, Sandford's first approach to Kinney was unfortunate.  His first written proposal included the line, "I believe our union will mean the marriage of the Lamb and His bride." She tore up the letter as blasphemy—but kept writing Sandford. Hiss, 91.&lt;/ref&gt;

On New Year's Day, 1893, Sandford told his church that God had told him, "Go."  He resigned his pulpit and gave away his savings in the teeth of an economic panic and depression.&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, 58; Harold U. Faulkner, ''Politics, Reform and Expansion, 1890-1900'' (New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1959), 141-42.&lt;/ref&gt; Sandford and his wife then began holding meetings in rural Maine—at the beginning with virtually no congregations and no financial support. But Sandford continued to preach.&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, 59-63.&lt;/ref&gt;  Eventually he achieved some success among people in the coastal hill regions of Maine, and contributions now came in plentifully, although Sandford did not solicit money or even pass a collection plate.&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, 68.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the fall of 1894, Sandford believed that he no longer bore responsibility for his actions, that he need only respond to the movings of the Holy Spirit.&lt;ref&gt;''Tongues of Fire'' 1 (September 1895): 3, quoted in Hiss, 104).&lt;/ref&gt; Thus abandoning the Free Baptists, he began to issue a monthly magazine in which he advertised for other workers to join him in his ministry.&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, 68; Hiss, 107-08. Sandford called this periodical "Tongues of Fire from the World's Evangelization Crusade on Apostolic Principles."&lt;/ref&gt; A year later with a small but committed following of young people, he announced the opening of a school, soon given the name "Holy Ghost and Us Bible School." The school charged no tuition, offered no courses, and had no teachers except Sandford and no textbooks except the Bible.&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, 72. One early member recalled that with Sandford's dynamic movements and knowledge of the Bible, "he could inspire a wooden Indian.  There was never a boring meeting." Lester McKenzie, quoted in Hiss, 120.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Shiloh==
In 1896, Sandford became convinced that God had told him to build a home for the Bible school on a sandy hill near [[Durham, Maine]].&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, 79. Sandford assured a local journalist that he didn't hear voices but discerned words from "inner consciousness." He said that God spoke to many people like that, but the "trouble with most folks is they won't listen." The journalist, Holman F. Day, was a gifted and imaginative man in his own right.  Though Day did not become a follower of Sandford, he treated Sandford sympathetically, and the two became friends. Hiss, 128.  See Ivan Cecil Sherman, "The Life and Work of Holman Francis Day," MA thesis, University of Maine, 1942.&lt;/ref&gt; At that moment Sandford had three cents in his pocket. Nevertheless, he had plenty of faith that God would provide the means of putting up a building without his explicitly asking for money. Although Sandford eventually decided that publishing a list of needs in his ''Tongues of Fire'' would be acceptable, the manner in which the money and volunteer labor was provided by supporters was nearly miraculous in any case.&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, 77-85.&lt;/ref&gt; Sandford had intended to name only [[Shiloh Temple|the main building]] "Shiloh" (after a [[Shiloh (biblical city)|place in the Bible]]), but the name "Shiloh" was obviously more mellifluous than "The Holy Ghost and Us," and it became the informal name of Sandford's movement.&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, 94.  "Shiloh" almost certainly had a greater significance to the eschatologically attuned Sandford than simply the town where the [[Ark of the Covenant]] had been kept before the building of the [[First Temple]]. In Genesis 49.10, "Shiloh" probably refers to the Messiah. As Hiss says,"Sandford too was much happier with this name than with the man-made implications of the 'World's Evangelization Crusade,' which from now on he used infrequently." Hiss, 174.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:ShilohMaine.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Shiloh (c. 1901)]]
At its height, the Shiloh had more than six hundred residents who attempted to "live in the supernatural." None worked for pay, and all depended on God to supply their material needs. To live at Shiloh meant to "be in a constant state of readiness for the 'Holy Spirit's latest,' as Sandford put it. This meant no settling into ruts of any kind.  It meant being ready to do any job, especially those you were least adept at....It meant being open to last-minute changes in schedule."&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, 86.&lt;/ref&gt; There ''was'' a typical schedule: one or two hours of private devotions in the morning, breakfast and kitchen chores, prayer at 9 AM, classes until noon, lunch before personal household or office duties.  But the schedule might be interrupted at any moment by some special request for prayer.  "God's work could not be crammed into a human schedule, and fussy ideas about order were not appropriate."&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, 87.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theological development===
Except for celebrating [[Jewish Feasts]] and keeping the [[Shabbat|Sabbath]] on Saturday, Sandford's theology was, at this point, not far from mainstream evangelicalism. Nevertheless, because Sandford believed that Thursday was the day on which Jesus was crucified, he and his followers prayed for six hours (from 9 AM to 3 PM) on that day.&lt;ref&gt;Rev. Frank Murray, Sandford's biographer, to the Androscoggin County Historical Society in 1967, at [http://www.fwselijah.com/fmurray.htm Fwselijah website]; White, 203: "[W]e had canned meat each Thursday, since no cooking could be done until after three o'clock. Thursday was considered the day on which Jesus was crucified, so religious service was constant from nine o'clock through the six hours of His suffering, thus commemorating His death weekly. These hours were too sacred to permit any ordinary work, such as cooking food, on the Hilltop."&lt;/ref&gt; In the summer of 1896, Sandford publicly discussed the two prophets mentioned in the [[Book of Revelation]] who would appear before Christ's [[Second Coming]], and he declared that his school would "stand by and if need be die" with them.&lt;ref&gt;Revelation 11.3-12; Nelson, 82.&lt;/ref&gt;  When Sandford's son John was born shortly after the dedication of Shiloh, Sandford said that (like [[John the Baptist]]), the boy had been "filled with the Holy Ghost even from his mother's womb."&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, 85; Luke 1.15.&lt;/ref&gt;

===British Israelism===
By 1898 Sandford had found additional spiritual and material support among Higher Life Christians in Boston and London, and he concluded that God now wanted him to establish an outpost in Palestine. Visiting Jerusalem for the first time, he dashed off a paper announcing that the [[Ten Lost Tribes]] were England and America, blood descendants of the ancient Hebrews who had been carried into captivity by the [[Ancient Assyrians|Assyrians]] in 721 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, 101-05. Sandford even seemed to believe that his Shiloh in Maine was the Shiloh to which the Old Testament referred.  Sandford developed these notions of [[British Israelism]] from the writings of [[C. A. L. Totten]], a former Professor of Military Tactics at [[Yale University]]. Hiss, 166-170.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[British Israelism]] was a religious version of ideas about Anglo-Saxon supremacy that were common to the contemporary English-speaking world, and the doctrine made the Bible all the more relevant because its prophecies seemed to apply to the people of Shiloh and the nation of which it was a part.&lt;ref&gt;Hiss, 170.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Divine healing===
By the early 20th century, the doctrine of divine healing had become an important part of Sandford's teaching. Initially skeptical, Sandford had resolved to “preach that part of the Bible” after attending an 1887 meeting where A.B. Simpson had spoken on the subject.  In 1897 Sandford also witnessed and praised the miracles of contemporary faith healer [[John Alexander Dowie]].&lt;ref&gt;Sandford wrote in ''Tongues of Fire'' (March 1897): "Dr. Dowie of Chicago prays with or for as many as 70,000 sick people a year, and thousands of the most astounding and remarkable miracles have taken place." Nelson, 113-14; [http://www.unitypublishing.com/NewReligiousMovements/WhatSpirtPart6.html Unity Publishing website.]&lt;/ref&gt; Soon ''Tongues of Fire'' reported healings of pneumonia, cancer, diphtheria, catarrh, "sick headache," sprained wrist, dropsy, typhoid, mental derangement, broken bones, and "utter exhaustion."&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, 113.&lt;/ref&gt; A local three-year-old girl who had been pronounced permanently blind by medical authorities suddenly regained her sight after prayer was offered for her at Shiloh.&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, 114-15; Peters, 82.&lt;/ref&gt; But the most spectacular case was the "resurrection" of Olive Mills, who had been seriously ill, perhaps with spinal meningitis. Told Mills was dead, Sandford found her without breath or pulse. In desperation he shouted, "Olive Mills! Come back! In the name of Jesus of Nazareth, come back!" Almost immediately, Mills opened her eyes, and within a few hours she was out of bed and dressed.&lt;ref&gt;Nelson 125-26. Mills, describing her [[near-death experience]] in the school magazine, diagnosed her own disease based on symptoms of a previous bout of cerebro-spinal meningitis.  In 1902, Mills again said she suffered with spinal meningitis. Sandford was shocked at her suffering and delirium, but Mills once more survived. Hiss, 327.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sandford believed the [[Epistle of James]] compelled Christians who were sick to call church elders for prayer and the [[laying on of hands]].  Sandford criticized Christians who sought treatment from physicians. He believed that illness might be the result of either discipline from God or an attack of Satan; but casting out demons required “prevailing prayer,” an exercise that included such protracted fervency and shouting that one skeptic became apprehensive as what sounded “like a hundred people talking at once” concluded with a woman’s screams piercing the din.&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, 115-17.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1899, Sandford received a divine message to complete a hospital in a hasty building drive—a technique frequently employed at Shiloh—but it was a hospital in which doctors were permitted only for diagnoses and consultations.  No medicines of any kind were provided.&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, 119-122.&lt;/ref&gt; Among those influenced by these early religious developments at Shiloh were [[A. J. Tomlinson]], founder of the [[Church of God (Cleveland, Tennessee)|Church of God]], and [[Charles Fox Parham]], one of the founders of the [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostal]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Parham stayed at Shiloh for a month, held meetings with Sandford in [[Winnipeg]] for another and then returned to [[Topeka|Topeka, Kansas]] to found Bethel Bible College, patterned after Shiloh, at which some of the first tongues speaking occurred in January 1901. Hiss, 247. The ''Lewiston Evening Journal'' of January 6, 1900 reported that during Shiloh's New Year's Eve prayer and praise service "the gifts of tongues...descended." Sandford said that there were 120 people present, the same number gathered at the first [[Pentecost]] in the [[Book of Acts]], but he insisted to the newspaper that the "speaking in tongues" was of foreign languages, not [[glossalalia]]. For more on the connections between Sandford, Parham, and Tomlinson see [http://www.unitypublishing.com/NewReligiousMovements/WhatSpirtPart6.html Unity Publishing website.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acting for God===

By end of the century Sandford became convinced "that as the passive agent of God's will, he could require exact and total obedience." Furthermore, as Hiss has written, to skeptics "Sandford's language vibrated with blasphemy, for in describing his own prayers as God's actions, he seemed to regard himself as having divine powers."&lt;ref&gt;Hiss, 233-34.&lt;/ref&gt;

Inevitably Sandford encountered opposition. A brief follower published an exposé, ''Sanfordism Exposed'',&lt;ref&gt;Hiss, 223-28.  The author, C. S. Weiss, a former Methodist minister and student at Moody Bible Institute, charged that Sandford raised large sums through threats of damnation, that sickness at Shiloh was caused by short rations and overwork, and that Sandford was dictatorial and given to unpredictable periods insanity. C. S. Weiss, ''Sandfordism Exposed: A Warning and Protest'' (Lisbon Falls, ME: privately printed, 1899). As Hiss says, although Weiss ended his book with the silliness of a "phrenological delineation" of Sandford, "an audience ready for exposés of Shiloh created a demand that newspapers and other critics continued to fill." (228)&lt;/ref&gt; and relatives of converts who wished to deed their property to Shiloh tried to have them declared insane.&lt;ref&gt;Hiss, 210, 386.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Durham benefited from levying taxes on the residential portions of Shiloh, the town also feared that block voting by Shiloh residents might dominate the town meeting, the school board, or the board of selectmen or, that in the event of bankruptcy, its members might become dependent on town charity.&lt;ref&gt;Hiss, 242-43, 394; Nelson, 139.&lt;/ref&gt;

More serious threats arose from among Sandford's own followers. The movement claimed to follow the leading of the Holy Spirit, but conflict developed when members disagreed about where the Holy Spirit was leading.&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, 144-45. "Higher lines Christians on the whole were not passive sheep, and as a rule they were not expected to be."&lt;/ref&gt;  In September 1900 Sandford announced that there would henceforth be an official chain of authority: God the Father, God the Son, the prophet whom God had chosen, ordained ministers subordinate to the prophet, everyone else subordinate to the ministers, with women and children also subordinate to their husbands and fathers.&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, 146; Hiss, 259.&lt;/ref&gt; Sandford then instituted an organized purge of members that "incorporated not just confession, but long day and night sessions of open and unrelenting criticism of each other.  One's capacity to accept that scouring in a contrite and cooperative spirit, without resentment or defensiveness, was the first step in passing the grade." One by one individuals were then brought before Sandford himself for final scrutiny by "the seven eyes of God."&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, 150. Hiss notes that tickets were printed for those who passed the examination reading, "The bearer 'looketh forth' from the Upper Room 'Fair, Clear, Terrible,'" and the tickets "were often treasured for the rest of the student's life." (262)&lt;/ref&gt;

Sandford also developed a three-tiered membership in his religious system:&lt;ref&gt;Sandford denied that he was starting a new denomination.  He said that he was making it possible for "true, higher-life Christians" to leave "denominational apostasy" and "get under the authority and order of the appointed man of God." Quoted in Nelson, 163.&lt;/ref&gt; those willing to be "100-fold warriors" would be supported by 60- and 30-fold members who would live in their own homes and continue to work. In 1901, to make a clean break with the past, Sandford instituted [[closed communion]] and rebaptized all local members of his society in the nearby [[Androscoggin River]].&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, 162, 166. Sandford performed another baptism of ninety-eight followers after Thanksgiving—through thick ice. No one ever questioned Sandford's stamina.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Identification with Elijah and David===

Shortly thereafter, Sandford announced that God had spoken three words to him "like a thunderbolt": "[[Elijah]] is Here!" And it was as Elijah that Sandford now called down God's judgment on "every lying pen," editors who had written critically "about this man of God."&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, 165. Sandford's erstwhile mentor, [[A. B. Simpson]], is supposed to have remarked that Sandford would not be "satisfied until he is extra-plenipotentiary with the Almighty Himself."&lt;/ref&gt; As usual Sandford was also making an eschatological reference. Sandford believed that he, as Elijah, would be one of the "[[Two Witnesses]]" of Revelation 11, who would be martyred and rise from the dead in Jerusalem before the coming of Christ's kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, 165. [[John Alexander Dowie]], accused of the deaths of "unhealed" persons, had just recently announced that ''he'' was Elijah. When asked about Dowie's claim, Sandford said he knew what God had said to him, and "I presume He knew what He was talking about."  Sandford chose his long-time loyal associate as "[[Moses]]," the other Witness who would be martyred and rise from the dead before Christ's coming. Nelson, 270; Hiss, 298.&lt;/ref&gt; The "Elijah" announcement was met with increased ridicule from the press and led to the breaking of all ties with followers of Moody and A. B. Simpson.&lt;ref&gt;Hiss, 298.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1902, after once again visiting Jerusalem, Sandford received a divine message that indicated that in some way, he was also the biblical [[David]].  Sandford had a portrait of himself printed encircled by the words "David careth for the Sheep," and he immediately renamed his movement "The Kingdom."&lt;ref&gt;Hiss, 319; Nelson, 177-78, 182. At nearly the same moment Sandford also identified himself with [[Melchizedek]] and thereby "in this complicated overlapping of symbols, Sandford, the forerunner of Christ, assumed the qualities of prophet, priest, and king." (180)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Manslaughter trial==
Sandford returned to Maine to find his community at what he considered a low spiritual ebb and with many members ill, most fearfully with [[smallpox]]. Peers were encouraged to closely examine each other's lives for sin, and parents regularly whipped children, a practice Sandford apparently condoned as the "schoolmaster to bring them to Christ."&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, 206.&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1903, Sandford instituted a "Ninevah Fast" forbidding all food or liquid for thirty-six hours even for infants, animals, and the sick. During that period fourteen-year-old Leander Bartlett, who had confessed to the most serious sin of planning to run away from Shiloh, died of [[diphtheria]].&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, 201-216. The "Ninevah Fast" was a reference to [[Book of Jonah|Jonah]] 3.7. Nelson dedicated her book to her uncle Leander, "who almost got away."&lt;/ref&gt; When Sandford's own six-year-old son, John, disobeyed him, Sandford ordered him to fast without food or water until he declared himself glad to be whipped.&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, 213-15 and Peters, 84. Although a glass of water was available to John, and a woman later testified that John asked for it "seventy-five times," he changed his mind when the glass was brought to him.  For three days the boy tried to take his whipping, but "his father felt he had not gotten absolute victory, and so sent him back to his room." Finally when his father decided the child was spiritually ready, Sandford declared that he would receive "three whippings, one for the Father, one for the Son, and one for the Holy Ghost." Then Sandford declared that the punishment would not be meted out because "Jesus had suffered and died for him." Newspaper and other primary sources about John Sandford's fast are reproduced at the [http://www.fwselijah.com/john%27s.htm fwselijah.com website.]&lt;/ref&gt; A prominent defector from the sect, Nathan Harriman, publicized John’s treatment and declared Sandford’s hold over the people of Shiloh a kind of hypnotism, in which God's requirements were "identical with those of Sandford.” &lt;ref&gt;Nelson, 217-224. Sandford replied that he was “heartily sorry” for Harriman, and “so far as I personally am concerned, I do not desire to be the dominant head of the movement . . . . The malevolence of our detractors only shows that the devil fears the work that we are doing and will take any means to balk us.”&lt;/ref&gt;

Many local residents took a dim view of Sandford, and the newspapers engaged in "long-running campaigns against Shiloh." One editor denounced Shiloh as " a damnable institution, a hell upon earth and the worst blot that ever disgraced the fair pages of Maine's history."&lt;ref&gt;Peters, 83.&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1904 Sandford was indicted by [[Androscoggin County]] on charges of [[child abuse|cruelty to children]] and [[manslaughter]]—cruelty in the case of his son and manslaughter for his role in Bartlett's death. A jury convicted Sandford on the cruelty charge but was hung on the charge of manslaughter.&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, 227-242, Peters 83-85. [http://www.fwselijah.com/leander.htm The manslaughter trial record].&lt;/ref&gt; On appeal, the verdict in the cruelty case was upheld; and at retrial, Sandford was convicted of manslaughter. In 1905, the Supreme Judicial Court of Maine reversed the manslaughter conviction because the trial judge had required jurors to make a decision based on their own belief about the "efficacy of prayer as a means to cure the sick."  Another jury trial resulted in another [[hung jury]].&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, 227-56. Sandford's 1905 trial is also covered in Shawn Francis Peters, ''When Prayer Fails: Faith Healing, Children, and the Law'' (Oxford University Press, 2008), 81-86.&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Sandford had his followers sign a ten-foot scroll called the "Pledge of Loyalty," which included among its articles of faith a statement that "F. W. Sandford of Shiloh, Maine, U.S.A." was Elijah and David, and that "I believe in and accept him as such."&lt;ref&gt;Hiss, 363-64. There were 507 signatures. The credo included the following: "I believe not only in the Father—the only Potentate—and in Jesus Christ—the King whose millenial [sic] reign is to prepare the globe for the great God—but also in the prophet-prince-priest who is to prepare the Kingdom for the Christ." The entire pledge may be found in [http://www.fwselijah.com/the1.htm ''The Everlasting Gospel'', March 31, 1904].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Circumnavigation on the ''Coronet''==
[[File:Yacht Coronet (1885)(Detroit-Publishing Co 1894-LOC).jpg|thumb|250px|left|''Coronet'' (1894)]]
While his manslaughter case was still in the courts, Sandford purchased the racing [[yacht]] [[Coronet (yacht)|''Coronet'']], an extravagantly appointed [[schooner]], for $10,000—raised in the usual Shiloh manner by prayer, "in this case, forty days and nights of it, with shifts for eating and sleeping."&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, 259-60. Ten thousand dollars in 1905 is easily the equivalent of two hundred thousand dollars a hundred years later. [http://www.measuringworth.com MeasuringWorth.com]. But ''Coronet'' was worth far more, having been built in 1885 for $75,000.&lt;/ref&gt; Sandford made two quick trips to [[Jerusalem]] in 1905-06, but when his legal difficulties had ended, he and his thirty selected crewmen and passengers (including his wife and five children) circumnavigated the globe on what he described as a missionary journey.&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, 285-86.&lt;/ref&gt; It was an unconventional missionary enterprise. No one went ashore to preach the Gospel or even distribute religious literature. Sandford intended to "subdue the world for Christ" by intercessory prayer, claiming nations and isles for Christ by sounding brass instruments as they passed by.&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, 286-87. Sandford even translated Revelation 6.2 as "a ''coronet'' was given him, and he went forth conquering and to conquer."&lt;/ref&gt; Oddly, Sandford added a [[taxidermy|taxidermist]] to a crew of reasonably experienced seamen, and he included on a ship already filled to capacity both "eyes for stuffed animals and birds" and a large harp on which he took lessons.&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, 287-88, 293. The original harp proved unsatisfactory, and Sandford had Shiloh order a new one for the ''Coronet'' to pick up in Australia, "the most costly [[Sébastien Érard|Erard]] harp obtainable, a No. 7, Louis XVI Model," sheathed in gold and costing a thousand dollars.&lt;/ref&gt; There were moments of real peril, as when the ''Coronet'' fought its way through the thundering seas around [[Cape Horn]] and then again after a powerful gale broke the [[main sheet]] and (indirectly) part of the mast almost immediately after Sandford had shot an [[albatross]].&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, 289-94.&lt;/ref&gt; During calmer periods, Sandford had leisure enough to hunt and receive an occasional vision.&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, 298-99. Off Africa Sandford saw a vision of [[John R. Mott]], an early acquaintance, telling Sandford that Mott's conversion of African multitudes had been made easy by Sandford's prayers. In fact, Mott was not a missionary at all but a recruiter for the [[Student Volunteer Movement]] and a leader in [[ecumenism|ecumenical]] Christianity.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later sea voyages==
Even before returning to Maine, Sandford heard that Florence Whittaker, a member of his outpost in Jerusalem, wanted to abandon the sect whether or not her minister husband (who had just accompanied Sandford on the multi-year circumnavigation) would leave with her.  At this point Sandford decided to bring back all his followers from Palestine, and Whittaker reluctantly agreed to accept passage to the United States on another Shiloh ship, the three-masted [[barquentine]], ''Kingdom''.  She was treated with utmost courtesy until they reached the Maine coast, at which point Sandford refused to let her land until she was "adjusted" to her husband.&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, 263, 295-97, 303-06.&lt;/ref&gt;  Eventually Whittaker was freed by court order and was then given custody of her children.&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, 306-07. Whittaker got word to her brother Rufus, who in turn received assistance from the earlier dissident Nathan Harriman.&lt;/ref&gt;

The story made sensational newspaper fare, especially when Florence Whittaker sued Sandford for forcible detention.  At the time Sandford was aboard the ''Coronet'', and authorities began watching ports to serve him the legal papers.&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, 307.&lt;/ref&gt;  Sandford determined that they would not find him, that a mission station should be opened immediately in Africa and perhaps another in [[Greenland]].&lt;ref&gt;Murray, 471-74, 914-17. It is quite possible that Sandford had been reminded of the first lines of the then famous missionary hymn by [[Reginald Heber]], "From Greenland’s icy mountains, from India’s coral strand;/Where Afric’s sunny fountains roll down their golden sand." (1819)&lt;/ref&gt;  In December 1910 more than seventy men, women, and children headed off to Africa, divided between the ''Kingdom'' and the ''Coronet''. In March 1911, the ''Kingdom'' went aground and was destroyed off the coast of [[French West Africa]].  Sandford blamed the wreck on the spiritual impotence of its passengers and crew, but he took everyone aboard the ''Coronet'', which now became fearfully overloaded with people and undersupplied with food and water.&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, 313-17, 322. Nelson says that everyone on board knew that Sandford considered the ''Kingdom's'' passengers and crew as "second-class citizens" who were "less concerned with obeying God than they were with their physical comfort and who listened to their own thoughts ('silly spawn from men's brains—thoughts') rather than to what God had to say." (322)&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, Sandford heard the supernatural direction, "Continue," which he interpreted to mean to sail on to Greenland. After recrossing the Atlantic to catch the northerly currents, the ''Coronet'' passed up numerous opportunities to take on water and supplies, Sandford announcing that God had ordered him not to put into port in the United States or Canada.&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, 321-28. What Sandford announced was that God had ordered him not to put into port at any country for which they had already prayed—which practically speaking meant the United States and Canada.&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, on September 6, 1911, there was a "quiet mutiny" of some sort off the [[Grand Banks]], and the ''Coronet'' was turned south.&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, 333.&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately, the ship now made little headway, and the passengers and crew were saved from possible starvation only by the fortuitous appearance of the ocean liner, S. S. Lapland, which provided some food—but ominously, no fruit or vegetables.&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, 337.&lt;/ref&gt;

Almost before they knew what was happening, men began to fall victim to [[scurvy]]; and within a few days after the ''Coronet'' reached [[Portland, Maine|Portland]] on October 21, 1911, scurvy had claimed the lives of six crew members.  Sandford was first arrested on Florence Whittaker's warrant and then, a few days later, for being responsible for the deaths—"unlawfully, knowingly, and willingly" allowing a ship to "proceed on a voyage at sea without sufficient provisions."&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, 335-43.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trial, conviction, and imprisonment==
Sandford refused to employ legal counsel at the trial, although he did receive legal advice—which he rejected.&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, 343-44.  During the trial Sandford testified that his attorneys had advised him not to tell the jury that he was acting under God's direction.&lt;/ref&gt; In court, Sandford declared that the sickness and starvation aboard the ''Coronet'' was punishment from God for refusing to obey his command to continue to Greenland. The jury brought in a guilty verdict within an hour. On December 17, 1911, Sanford was sentenced to serve not more than ten years at the federal penitentiary in [[Atlanta, Georgia]].&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, 344-47. Sandford, reveling in his martyrdom, said his "whole being" was "flooded with joy" when he discovered that on the train ride to Atlanta, he was shackled to two thieves. Florence Whittaker's suit for false imprisonment was, of course, overshadowed by the guilty verdict; eventually she received a court-designated award of $2,500 (roughly $50,000 in the early 21st century). Nelson, 348; ''Portland Express Advertiser'', 7 February 1912.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Sandford accepted imprisonment as the will of God, he had difficulty at first bending to prison regulations. But with sleep, proper nourishment, and enforced exercise, his health gradually improved. He even insisted that Shiloh residents drop whatever they were doing at 11:30 and 4:00 and exercise with him. He was made a gatekeeper and given a pass that allowed him to spend some time out of doors. He also volunteered to teach a group of prisoners how to read and write and especially enjoyed conducting a weekly Bible class that began with one student and grew to more than a hundred. Eventually Shiloh was allowed to send him a harp, and Sandford was not only able to practice, he gave at least two concerts at the prison.&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, 355; Hiss, 487-89.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sandford had appointed seven ministers to share responsibility for leading the group, but his letters were treated like "a purse of gold." Many of them, even private letters to his family, were printed and distributed. Because prisoners were only allowed to send two letters a month, a sect member moved to Atlanta and took dictation during weekly visits.&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, 354-55; Hiss, 516.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious downfall==
During his imprisonment, Sandford tried to promote his teenage son John as a Shiloh leader, and John seems to have had some success at editing a new periodical, ''The Golden Trumpet''.&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, 359-60.&lt;/ref&gt; But when in 1915, John was put in charge of an inquisitorial board called the "Eye-of-the-Needle," intended to probe the souls of Shiloh residents, Sandford himself brought the experiment to a halt when his son incurred resentment and, in any case, proved temperamentally unsuited to the task. Shortly thereafter, Marguerite, one of Sandford's daughters, ran away from the community, a serious blow to Sandford's authority because of his insistence that leaders be able to "handle their children."&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, 360-65. Sandford said that he felt "like stone" at his daughter's defection, but he encouraged his followers to consider that they would "laugh and dance for millions of years as we see multitudes worshiping our great God BECAUSE we 'didn't fail or get discouraged' while on earth. Let's clasp hands and ride like lightning on our family charger into the future."(365)&lt;/ref&gt;

Given three years off for good behavior, Sandford was released from prison in September 1918. When he reappeared at Shiloh, he was served a sumptuous meal, although many Shiloh residents had recently suffered serious illness and almost all, hunger. Sandford's return to Shiloh sparked new contributions and new healings, even food enough for two meals a day.&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, 379-84, 393.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, three days after his arrival, another of Sandford's daughters ran away,&lt;ref&gt;Hiss, 529.  Sandford disfellowshipped the girls; much later in life they reestablished relations with the Kingdom.&lt;/ref&gt; and a few months later Sandford left Maine for the sect's Boston headquarters.&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, 382-83, 394. Sandford said that God had spoken the word "Remove" and that the Holy Ghost had "been dethroned on Shiloh Hilltop." (394)&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the sect had conducted virtually no evangelistic outreach since the beginning of Sandford's imprisonment in 1911.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fwselijah.com/boomer.htm fwselijah website].&lt;/ref&gt;

The end of the Shiloh community came suddenly in 1920 after the death of Shiloh resident Elma Hastings and a suit brought by relatives for guardianship of her children on the grounds of non-support by their father.  Then the Children's Protective Society of Maine, having investigated living conditions at Shiloh, urged that all minors be removed from the community.&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, 408-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1920, Sandford sent the message, "Work."&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, 411-12. Nelson writes that Sandford was "in no mood to face the courts about anything.  Since his release from prison, he had been hearing of efforts to resurrect the indictments in the remaining five ''Coronet'' deaths which had been 'continued in 1911."&lt;/ref&gt; No one anticipated that this directive would effectively end the Shiloh community within days.  Two months later the prayer vigils had stopped, the Bible school was closed, and the Shiloh population had dropped from 370 to a handful.&lt;ref&gt;''Lewiston Evening Journal'', May 3, 10, 13, 1920.&lt;/ref&gt; As Nelson has written, once the men went off to the mills, everything changed.  With "the assurance that they would never be hungry again," that their needs would be met in the same way everyone else's were met, "there was no reason to stay.  They could be ordinary Christians anywhere."&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, 412-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Retirement ==
Before Shiloh was finally deserted in May, Sandford heard the heavenly direction to "Retire."&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, 417.&lt;/ref&gt; For the remainder of his life, Sandford lived in seclusion near the village of [[Hobart, New York]] in the [[Catskill Mountains]]. He prayed, farmed, raised sheep, studied astronomy, taught small groups, and gradually regathered his scattered followers into centers in different parts of the country. Messages were delivered to the faithful by a smaller inner circle.&lt;ref&gt;Frank S. Murray, ''The Sublimity of Faith'' (Amherst, NH: The Kingdom Press, 1981), 651-909; Nelson, 417; [http://www.fwselijah.com/timeline.htm#3-%204-1948 fwselijah.com]. Murray is virtually the only source for these years of Sandford's "retirement" because he was present during most of the period, the movement had no publication, and two serious fires destroyed much of Sandford's own personal writings. Hiss, 543. "Over the next several years, the members were trained to keep absolute silence about the Kingdom's affairs, and never under any circumstances to reveal Sandford's presence." Hiss, 544.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sandford continued to be supported by the tithes of his followers, and his retirement was "satisfying and serene," although his papers and books were twice destroyed in house fires.&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, 419: "Rested and relaxed, he was something of a lovable curmudgeon, teasing people, insisting that the middle-aged women join in the games of baseball, calling everyone out into a freezing night to look at something he had just found through his telescope, holding a contest for the discovery of the first spring bluebird and winning it himself." Hiss, 582.&lt;/ref&gt; To some degree Sandford relaxed his earlier rhetoric. On New Year's Eve, 1941, he received a message from God to "remit the sins of each and every person that has been baptized since October 1, 1901."&lt;ref&gt;Hiss, 586. Nelson also notes that in 1943, he included in the Kingdom Army men such as [[D. L. Moody]], the Booths of the [[Salvation Army]], and [[A. B. Simpson]], whom he earlier would have excluded. Nelson, 421.&lt;/ref&gt; But he never renounced his claim to be Elijah; nor did he ever express remorse for those who had died on the ''Coronet'' thirty years earlier.&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, 421.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sandford's death on March 4, 1948 was quiet and peaceful. His funeral and interment, however, were hasty and secretive. The news of his death was not released to the press for six weeks. Sandford had, of course, not died as Elijah in Jerusalem, but as an unheralded inhabitant of a Catskill village.&lt;ref&gt;Hiss notes than when Sandford's death was clearly imminent, "all were thinking not only of the loss of his ministry, but of the apparent failure of prophecy." (597) Nelson, 423-24. Helen Kinney Sandford had died in 1941 and had been buried in the old Shiloh cemetery.(420)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
The Kingdom continued after Sandford's death under the informal leadership of Victor Abram, his personal secretary, although Sandford never had a true successor.&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, 424: "As for a 'successor,' there was none, and there never would be.  The future leadership of the Kingdom would be shared and custodial.&lt;/ref&gt; At Abram’s death in 1977, his son-in-law, Joseph Wakeman, became leader but thought of himself "as more of a caretaker." The membership then gradually learned that Abram had had a series of extra-marital affairs while leading an organization that emphasized moral purity.&lt;ref name="fwselijah website"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fwselijah.com/boomer.htm |title=fwselijah website |publisher=Fwselijah.com |date= |accessdate=2011-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A successor organization, Kingdom Christian Ministries—reorganized in 1998 after a split occasioned by continued debate over Sandford's theology&lt;ref name="fwselijah website"/&gt;—has several hundred members at a few centers in the eastern United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kingdomchristianministries.org/churches/index.htm Kingdom Christian Ministries website].&lt;/ref&gt; An independent evangelical Christian church, Shiloh Chapel, meets in a remaining portion of the original Shiloh building in Durham, Maine; it is no longer affiliated with Kingdom Christian Ministries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shilohchapelmaine.org/ Shiloh Chapel website].&lt;/ref&gt;  The building is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] for its distinctive architecture and history.

'''Gareth''' is a [[fictional character]] from the American television series ''[[The Walking Dead (TV series)|The Walking Dead]]'' portrayed by [[Andrew J. West]]. Gareth is based on '''[[List of The Walking Dead (comics) characters#The Hunters|Chris]]''' from the [[Walking Dead (comics)|comic book series of the same name]], according to West himself.&lt;ref name="tvguide"/&gt; Gareth is introduced at the end of season 4. He is initially introduced as the welcoming yet mysterious leader of Terminus. However, his true motivations are revealed after Gareth forces [[Rick Grimes]] and his fellow survivors into [[train car]] A. At the beginning of season 5, it is revealed Gareth and his entire community are cannibals. As the result of the actions by [[Carol Peletier]], the group escapes, leaving many casualties of Terminus. Gareth, however, leads the remaining survivors to try to hunt down Rick's group and eat them.

===Fictional character biography===

====Season 4====
{{see also|The Walking Dead (season 4)}}
In the season finale "[[A (The Walking Dead)|A]]," Gareth first appears as the leader of Terminus.  When [[Rick Grimes|Rick]], [[Carl Grimes|Carl]], [[Daryl Dixon|Daryl]], and [[Michonne]] sneak into Terminus and introduce themselves, Gareth and Alex welcome them.  Gareth then takes them outside to get food from Mary. Rick notices that items from missing members of his group are being used by Terminus residents, so he suddenly slaps a plate of meat out of Alex's hand and takes him hostage. A shootout ensues, resulting in Alex's death, forcing the group to run for cover. After being herded by gunfire through the complex, they are finally pinned down by snipers and forced to surrender. Gareth orders them one-by-one to enter a train car parked nearby, and they are reunited with the rest of the group.

====Season 5====
{{see also|The Walking Dead (season 5)}}
In the season premiere "[[No Sanctuary (The Walking Dead)|No Sanctuary]]," a flashback shows that Gareth, his brother Alex, and several Terminus residents are locked in a train car after being attacked by unknown visitors. Alex regrets putting up the signs that lead to Terminus, while Gareth retorts that they were only being human. Alex then asks him, "What are we now?" In the present, Rick, Daryl, [[Glenn Rhee|Glenn]], and [[Bob Stookey|Bob]] have been rounded up and led into a butchering room to face a trough alongside several other captives, including [[Indifference (The Walking Dead)|Sam]], two butchers then execute Sam and three other prisoners by [[Exsanguination|bleeding them out]]. Afterwards, Glenn's death is narrowly averted when Gareth shows up to discuss mundane operations with the butchers and interrogate Rick about the bag of weapons he buried in the woods. As the butchers prepare to kill Glenn, gunfire erupts outside followed by an explosion.  Gareth leaves the room, and Rick takes advantage of the chaos and kills the butchers. As the group fights their way out of Terminus, which is partially destroyed and filling with walkers, Rick shoots Gareth, who is leading some of his men out, in the shoulder. In the episode "[[Strangers (The Walking Dead)|Strangers]]," Rick's group has taken refuge inside a church.  Bob steps outside the church alone and is knocked unconscious by a hooded figure. When he wakes up, he is face to face with Gareth, who explains that he and his group of survivors from Terminus were once normal, but with the destruction of Terminus they have evolved into 'hunters.' It is then revealed that the group cut off Bob's left leg in order to eat it. Gareth casually says, "If it makes you feel any better, you taste much better than we thought you would."

[[File:I Made You a Promise.png|thumb|left|250px|Gareth, confronted by [[Rick Grimes]] and [[Sasha Williams (The Walking Dead)|Sasha Williams]] moments before his death.]]
In the episode "[[Four Walls and a Roof]]," Bob, laughing hysterically, informs Gareth and the other Terminus survivors that they just consumed tainted meat as he was bitten by a walker (in "Strangers"). While the other members begin to react in horror and vomit, Gareth angrily kicks Bob unconscious and suggests that they will be fine as the meat was cooked. They later leave Bob on the lawn at Father [[Gabriel Stokes (The Walking Dead)|Gabriel]]'s church where the other survivors find him. Bob tells them that the place the Terminus group was at resembled a school and Rick, Sasha, Abraham, Tara, Glenn and Maggie set off to find an old elementary school while Eugene, Rosita, Tyreese, Bob, Carl and Judith are left behind. Gareth and the Terminus survivors ambush the church and prepare to shoot open the doors to the room they are hiding in after Judith's cry gives away their location. Before they can shoot the doors open, Rick shoots two Terminus members in the head, killing them, revealing that Rick expected the Terminus members would ambush the church once they departed. Rick shoots off two of Gareth's fingers, bringing him to his knees as he pleads with Rick that if he is let go, their paths will never cross again and that he knows what it's like to be hungry. Rick denies the request, knowing that Gareth's group will continue to kill others, and pulls out his red-handled machete that he had previously threatened to kill Gareth with while held captive at Terminus. Rick reminds Gareth of his earlier promise and then hacks Gareth to death with the machete.

==Development and reception==
Andrew West has stated that the character is based on Chris the hunter from the comic series. Several parallels can be drawn between Gareth's and Chris's character arcs, including similar dialogue, events and the outfit.&lt;ref name="tvguide"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/News/The-Walking-Dead-Andrew-J-West-1088184.aspx|title=The Walking Dead Postmortem: Andrew J.

Terri Schwartz of ''[[Zap2it]]'' commented on the episode "[[Strangers (The Walking Dead)|Strangers]]", saying "surprisingly Father Gabriel Stokes wasn't the biggest arrival in the episode. Though he is a man who -- as is repeatedly said in the series -- clearly has something to hide, it's the reveal that Gareth and the Terminans have turned into the Hunters from "The Walking Dead" comics that is the most skin-crawling, stomach-turning moment in the episode."&lt;ref name="zap2it"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.zap2it.com/blogs/the_walking_dead_season_5_strangers_recap_bob_cannibals_hunters_father_gabriel-2014-10|title='The Walking Dead' Season 5: What about Bob?|last=Schwartz|first=Terri|work=Zap2it|date=October 19, 2014|accessdate=October 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''William James Myers''' (April 16, 1937 – February 16, 2017), better known by his [[ring name]] '''George''' "'''The Animal'''" '''Steele''', was an American [[Professional wrestling|professional wrestler]], school teacher, author, and [[actor]]. His career lasted from 1967 until 1988, though he made occasional wrestling appearances into the 1990s and 2000s.

Steele portrayed Swedish wrestler and actor [[Tor Johnson]] in [[Tim Burton]]'s film ''[[Ed Wood (film)|Ed Wood]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9405E0DA143AF930A1575AC0A962958260|title=Ed Wood (1994) Film Festival Review; Ode to a Director Who Dared to Be Dreadful|last=Maslin|first=Janet|publisher=[[New York Times]]|date=September 23, 1994|accessdate=April 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1956, Myers entered [[Michigan State University]] as a football player for the [[Michigan State Spartans]], but his career as a football player was immediately cut short as a result of knee problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.profootballarchives.com/1961uflgr.html|title=1961 Grand Rapids Shamrocks - The Pro Football Archives|website=www.profootballarchives.com|access-date=2018-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1961, he was with the Grand Rapids Blazers ([[United Football League (1961–64)|UFL]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.profootballarchives.com/1961uflgr.html|title=1961 Grand Rapids Shamrocks - The Pro Football Archives|website=www.profootballarchives.com|access-date=2018-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After earning a bachelor of science degree from [[Michigan State University]] and a [[master's degree]] from [[Central Michigan University]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.georgetheanimalsteele.com/biography-of-george-steele.php George "The Animal" Steele :: The Biography] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070703191643/http://www.georgetheanimalsteele.com/biography-of-george-steele.php |date=July 3, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Myers became a teacher, [[Amateur wrestling|amateur wrestling coach]], and football coach at Madison High School in [[Madison Heights, Michigan]]. There he would eventually become a member of the Michigan Coaches Hall of Fame.&lt;ref name=Legends/&gt;&lt;ref name="hall_of_fame"&gt;[http://www.mhsfca.com/hall.of.fame.html hall_of_fame] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070614173057/http://www.mhsfca.com/hall.of.fame.html |date=June 14, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Professional wrestling career==
Looking to supplement his income, he got into the world of Detroit-area professional wrestling, but in order to protect his privacy, he wrestled using a mask and the name '''The Student'''.&lt;ref name=PWHOF&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pwhf.org/halloffamers/bios/steele.asp|title=Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame – George The Animal Steele|publisher=[[Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame and Museum]]|accessdate=2011-09-09|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110907081439/http://www.pwhf.org/halloffamers/bios/steele.asp|archivedate=September 7, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gary Hart (wrestler)|Gary Hart]] served as The Student's manager and had to explain to the announcers why his client could not apply any legitimate holds or maneuvers instead relying on only his undisciplined brute strength.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=My Life In Wrestling: With A Little Help From My Friends|last=Hart|first=Gary|publisher=GEAN Publishing|year=2009|isbn=0692000461|location=United States Of America|pages=15–18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Myers was soon scouted by [[World Wrestling Entertainment|World Wide Wrestling Federation]] (WWWF) champion [[Bruno Sammartino]] and began working in [[Pittsburgh]] in 1967 on the popular ''[[Studio Wrestling]]'' TV show broadcast on WIIC-TV (later [[WPXI]]-TV) Channel 11. Sammartino had liked the character Myers developed of a wild man with incredible strength. However, he had him drop the mask, as well as the title of The Student. Looking to hide his real name, Myers opted for the alias "George Steele". According to Michigan High School Hall of Fame Coach George Steele of Warren, he and Myers were coaching against each other in a high school JV match-up while both were early into their careers. At halftime, Myers approached Steele and told him about his venture into wrestling and that he was looking for a name. Myers allegedly asked Steele if he could use his name, that he liked it a lot and the future Hall of Fame coach told him no problem. Steele states in an interview available on [[YouTube]] that he was in Pittsburgh when he was looking for a stage name. Local wrestler "Jumpin'" John DeFazio suggested Jim Steele since he was in the "Steel City". He didn't like the first name Jim and he suggested George which is what he eventually went with.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pittsburgh.cbslocal.com/2013/06/03/george-the-animal-steele-talks-wrestling-career-pittsburgh-connection/|title=George "The Animal" Steele Talks Wrestling Career, Pittsburgh Connection|publisher=[[KDKA-TV|KDKA]].com|access-date=2017-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Working well with Sammartino, he was invited for a full run in the WWWF. He told WWWF TV commentator Ray Morgan that he was the nephew of [[Peter Sauer|Ray Steele]] ([[kayfabe]]) and had an extensive amateur background. He sold the story by using an array of armlocks on opponents, weakening them for his finisher, the Flying Hammerlock (Steele would lift his opponents off the mat by a hammerlocked arm). He also revealed his teaching background to interviewers that made his in-ring Neanderthal image all the more incongruous. He wrestled Sammartino to an hour-long draw at Madison Square Garden but lost the rematch. In Boston, being set up to face Sammartino for a long series in that city, he got one of the few clean wins over Victor Rivera, a top babyface, with the flying hammerlock submission, at a huge [[Fenway Park]] outdoor show. He was then relegated to a feud with Chief Jay Strongbow, and lost to Edouard Carpentier at the Garden before taking a brief hiatus to reinvent his wildman character.

Steele became a true [[Heel (professional wrestling)#crazy heel|crazy heel]], acting like a wild man in the ring, tearing up the turnbuckle with his teeth and using the stuffing as a weapon as well as sticking out his green tongue (an effect accomplished by eating green [[Clorets]] [[Mint (candy)|breath mints]]).&lt;ref name="hall_of_fame"/&gt; The Animal had a stooped posture and a hairless head, but a thick mat of fur on his back; wrestling broadcasters often speculated that The Animal was indeed "the missing link". At best, The Animal could occasionally manage to utter a word or two during interviews with one of them usually being "Duh-da-dahh" or "YOU! YOU go!"
[[File:Animal in B&amp; W.jpg|thumb|George Steele in 2009]]
As Steele recalled in a later shoot interview, his infamous "Duh-dahh" interview style happened by accident. Throughout his career, Steele prided himself on being able to cut eloquent and effective promos and ranked his mic skills with the best in the business. At a WWF TV taping in the early 1980s, he was cutting one of these promos when Vince McMahon cut him off and reminded Steele that his gimmick was the "Animal", and for an animal, he was "making too much sense". Incensed, Steele did a second take of nothing but garbled and incoherent syllables ("Duhh-dahh"). Steele did this deliberately and out of pure frustration, thinking that McMahon would acquiesce and allow Steele to cut his normal, eloquent promos. Much to Steele's shock, McMahon replied, "That's exactly what I want!", and this would remain Steele's interview style for the rest of his WWF run. Steele started to fully cultivate his gimmick of a menacing imbecile.

Steele eventually became one of the more popular and recognizable wrestlers during most of the [[1980s professional wrestling boom]]. He turned face during the first episode of ''[[Saturday Night's Main Event results#Saturday Night's Main Event I|Saturday Night's Main Event]]'' when his partners in a six-man match, [[Nikolai Volkoff]] and [[The Iron Sheik]], abandoned him to their opponents, [[Ricky Steamboat]] and the U.S. Express ([[Barry Windham]] and [[Mike Rotunda]]), leading to Steele being taken under the wing of the Express' manager, [[Lou Albano|Capt. Lou Albano]], who consoled him following the loss. His most famous feud was in 1986 against [[Randy Savage|"Macho Man" Randy Savage]], after Steele developed a crush on Savage's valet, [[Miss Elizabeth]]. The feud was meant to last only a couple of months (and end with Steele being disappointed), but it proved so popular with fans that it continued well into 1987. During Savage’s Intercontinental Championship match against Steamboat at [[WrestleMania III]], Steele — who was in Steamboat’s corner — twice interfered in the match. First, he took the ring bell from Savage as he attempted to use it off of the top rope. Secondly, after Savage kicked him and took the bell back, Steele shoved Savage off of the top rope, allowing Steamboat to roll up Savage for the pin to win the championship.

In 1988, Steele began carrying a stuffed animal named "Mine" to the ring. He participated in the [[Wrestlemania IV]] Battle Royal but was outside of the ring the whole time. According to Steele, he suffered a knee injury at a house show prior to the event, which was the reason he didn't get in the ring. Late in 1988, Steele retired after being diagnosed with [[Crohn's disease]]. Steele then became a road agent for the WWF until he was released in October 1990 due to budget cuts. Soon after, however, Steele was re-hired by the WWF and continued to work as an agent until the late 1990s. Though he left the WWF without any WWF championships behind him, Steele grew to become one of the most recognized and popular figures in WWF history and was inducted into the [[WWE Hall of Fame|WWF Hall Of Fame]] [[WWE Hall of Fame (1995)|class of 1995]].

In 1998, during the WWF's "[[Attitude Era]]", Steele returned as part of [[The Oddities (professional wrestling)|The Oddities]].&lt;ref name=Legends/&gt; Then on January 10, 2000, he appeared on an episode of ''[[WCW Monday Nitro]]'' as one of three legends [[Jeff Jarrett]] had to face that night.&lt;ref name=PWHOF/&gt; Eight years later, Steele made an appearance at [[TNA Wrestling]]'s 2008 [[Slammiversary (2008)|Slammiversary]] pay-per-view event as a groomsman in the [[Kayfabe|wedding]] for "Black Machismo" [[Jay Lethal]] and [[SoCal Val]], along with [[Koko B. Ware]], [[Kamala (wrestler)|Kamala]], and [[Jake Roberts|Jake "The Snake" Roberts]].

Steele made a surprise appearance on ''[[WWE Raw|Monday Night Raw]]'' on November 15, 2010, during a match between [[Kofi Kingston]] and [[David Otunga]].

In 1998, doctors told Myers that his Crohn's Disease had gone into remission and that he no longer suffered from any of the disease's symptoms.&lt;ref name=Crol. /&gt; In 2002, to prevent the symptoms from returning, Myers had his colon removed.&lt;ref name="Crol."/&gt;

Myers was a devout [[Christian]]. He attended the First Baptist Church Merritt Island and lived in [[Cocoa Beach, Florida]] with his wife Pat,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.georgetheanimalsteele.com/home.php George "The Animal" Steele] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070718174801/http://www.georgetheanimalsteele.com/home.php |date=July 18, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; whom he married before he entered Michigan State in 1956. Together, Pat and Jim had two sons, Dennis and Randy, and a daughter, Felicia.

==Death==
On February 16, 2017, Myers died in hospital care due to [[kidney failure]], at the age of 79.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wrestlinginc.com/wi/news/2017/0217/623327/wwe-hall-of-famer-george-the-animal-steele-passes-away-at-79/ WWE Hall Of Famer George 'The Animal' Steele Passes Away At 79]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.f4wonline.com/wwe-news/george-animal-steele-passes-away-79-years-old-230311|title=George 'The Animal' Steele passes away at 79 years old|date=2017-02-17|work=WON/F4W - WWE news, Pro Wrestling News, WWE Results, UFC News, UFC results|access-date=2018-05-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Acting career==
In 1994, Steele made his professional acting debut as Swedish wrestler-turned-actor [[Tor Johnson]] in [[Tim Burton]]'s ''[[Ed Wood (film)|Ed Wood]]''.&lt;ref name=Legends/&gt; Coincidentally, Steele was often mistaken for Johnson earlier in his career. According to Steele, a New York novelty shop once sold a Tor Johnson mask as a George Steele mask to increase sales, due to Steele's popularity at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.milb.com/content/page.jsp?ymd=20140301&amp;content_id=68542166&amp;vkey=team2|title=George the Animal Steele - June 8 {{!}} MiLB.com Open Category 2 {{!}} The Official Site of Minor League Baseball|website=MiLB.com|language=en|access-date=2018-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008 Steele co-starred with [[Greg Valentine]] in a short film entitled ''Somethin Fishy'', in which the two former wrestlers purchase a fishing camp. The film served as the pilot for a comedy series that was not developed further.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Somethin Fishy Film Pilot|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AoJWUo2FDc|publisher=YouTube.com|accessdate=2017-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Steele also appeared in a [[Minolta]] commercial with actor [[Tony Randall]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=flyinghammerlock|title=ANIMALSP.MOV George The Animal Steele|date=2010-02-20|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVyDV8hotE8|accessdate=2018-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other media==
Steele appears in the video game ''[[WWE SmackDown! Here Comes the Pain]]'' as a legend character. He is also featured in all three games in the ''[[Legends of Wrestling (series)|Legends of Wrestling]]'' series.

His book, "Animal", was released on June 1, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Sonnenberg |first=Maria |editor-last=Stover |editor-first=Bob |title=The Animal pins problems to the mat |date=27 July 2014 |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/113534012/ |newspaper=Florida Today |publisher=Jeff Kiel |location=Cocoa, Florida |via=[[Newspapers.com]] |volume=49 |issue=133 |page=5E}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A song about Steele titled "George Steele" appears on the album ''Charmed Life'' by punk rock band Half Japanese.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.last.fm/music/Half+Japanese/_/George+Steele|title=George Steele — Half Japanese {{!}} Last.fm|website=Last.fm|language=en|access-date=2018-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lyrics include "There's a man who I admire, a man who set his hair on fire."

Steele is referenced in the ''[[Seinfeld]]'' episode, "[[The Bizarro Jerry]]". Repulsed by the "man hands" of his current girlfriend, Jerry complains, "I feel like I'm dating George 'The Animal' Steele."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://theseinfelddictionary.com/2010/07/01/man-hands/|title=man hands|date=2010-07-01|work=The Seinfeld Dictionary|access-date=2018-05-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Himiltrude''' (c. 742-c.780?) was the mother of [[Charlemagne]]'s first-born son [[Pippin the Hunchback]].

==Life==

Little is known about Himiltrude's origins. [[Paulus Diaconus]] calls her a "noble girl".&lt;ref name="Konecny"&gt;Silvia Konecny, ''Die Frauen des karolingischen Königshauses. Die politische Bedeutung der Ehe und die Stellung der Frau in der fränkischen Herrscherfamilie vom 7. bis zum 10. Jahrhundert.'', [http://www.mittelalter-genealogie.de/karolinger_familie_karls/himiltrud_frankenkoenigin_769.html p. 65] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081207182933/http://www.mittelalter-genealogie.de/karolinger_familie_karls/himiltrud_frankenkoenigin_769.html |date=2008-12-07 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; The appearance of her name in the fraternity books of [[Alemannia]]n monasteries may suggest an affiliation with the [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] Alemannian or Alsatian nobility,&lt;ref name="Hägermann"&gt;Dieter Hägermann, ''Karl der Große. Herrscher des Abendlands'', Ullstein 2003, p. 82f.&lt;/ref&gt; while other sources make her the daughter of a Burgundian count and a granddaughter of Grimbert&amp;nbsp;I, Count of Paris. It is not possible, however, to extrapolate any political ramifications from Charlemagne's relationship with Himiltrude.&lt;ref name="Konecny"/&gt; 

Himiltrude probably entered into a relationship with Charlemagne during the lifetime of his father, [[Pepin the Younger]].&lt;ref name="Konecny"/&gt; When Charlemagne acceded to the throne in 768, Himiltrude remained unnamed in official sources &amp;ndash; contrary to the example set by Charlemagne's mother, [[Bertrada of Laon]].&lt;ref name="Konecny"/&gt; Himiltrude bore Charles a son called [[Pepin the Hunchback|Pépin]]. Shortly after Pepin's birth, an alliance was formulated between Charlemagne and the King of the Lombards, [[Desiderius]].  To seal the alliance, it was agreed that Charlemagne should marry Desiderius' daughter (called [[Desiderata of the Lombards|Desiderata]] by modern scholars). 

Himiltrude was dismissed at that time and disappears from historical records. A grave excavated in the monastery of [[Nivelles]] was found to contain the corpse of a forty-year-old woman, possibly identifiable with Himiltrude.  If so, Himiltrude would appear to have died long after 770, although if and when she retired to Nivelles cannot be deduced.&lt;ref name="Konecny"/&gt;

Her son Pépin, who suffered from a spinal deformity and was called "the Hunchback", was eclipsed by Charlemagne's sons from his later marriage to [[Hildegard of Vinzgouw|Hildegard]]. Following an attempted rebellion against his father, Pepin was confined to a monastery.&lt;ref name="Konecny"/&gt;

==Marital status==
The nature of Himiltrude's relationship to Charlemagne is a matter of dispute. Charlemagne's biographer [[Einhard]] calls her a "concubine"&lt;ref&gt;Einhard, ''[[Vita Karoli Magni]]'', ch. 20&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Paulus Diaconus]] speaks of Pippin's birth "before legal marriage",&lt;ref name="Konecny"/&gt; whereas a letter by [[Pope Stephen III]] refers to Charlemagne and his brother Carloman as being already married (to Himiltrude and [[Gerberga, wife of Carloman I|Gerberga]]), and advises them not to dismiss their wives.&lt;ref name="Konecny"/&gt; 

Historians have interpreted the information in different ways. Some, such as [[Pierre Riché]], follow Einhard in describing Himiltrude as a concubine.&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Riché, ''The Carolingians'', p.86.&lt;/ref&gt; Others, Dieter Hägemann for example, consider Himiltrude a wife in the full sense.&lt;ref name="Hägermann"/&gt; Still others subscribe to the idea that the relationship between the two was "something more than concubinage, less than marriage" and describe it as a [[Friedelehe]], a supposed form of marriage unrecognized by the Church and easily dissolvable. This form of relationship is often seen in a conflict between Christian marriage and more flexible Germanic concepts.&lt;ref name="Konecny"/&gt;

'''Ignacio Corsini''' (February 13, 1891 – July 26, 1967) was an [[Italian people|Italian]]-born [[Argentine]] [[Argentine music#Folk music|folklore]] and [[Argentine Tango|tango]] musician.

==Life and work==
Andrés Ignacio Corsini was born in [[Troina]], a village in the [[Enna]] Province of [[Sicily]], in 1891. He was the illegitimate son of Socorro Salomone and a local man whose identity was never revealed publicly—save for his being a Corsini (hence the child's last name). Ms. Salomone left [[Italy]] for [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]] in 1896, and settled in the middle-class [[Almagro, Buenos Aires|Almagro]] section of the city.  They settled in [[Carlos Tejedor, Buenos Aires|Carlos Tejedor]], then a small [[pampas]] town where Corsini would spend the remainder of his childhood, finding work as an [[bullock cart|ox cart]] driver and [[herder|herdsman]].&lt;ref name=tango&gt;[http://www.todotango.com/english/creadores/icorsini.asp Todo Tango: Ignacio Corsini]&lt;/ref&gt;

Corsini returned in 1907 to the Almagro section of Buenos Aires, where he was influenced by folk singer [[José Betinotti]] and a [[circus]] performer, José Pacheco.  Pacheco introduced him to the [[Argentine culture#Cinema and theatre|theatre]] and to his own daughter, Victoria Pacheco, whom Corsini would marry in 1911. He went on to perform in numerous theatre companies and circuses, and in 1912, he was awarded a recording contract by [[RCA Victor]]. His interpretation of traditional folklore standards earned him singing roles in numerous [[Argentine cinema|Argentine films]] in subsequent years, mostly in [[period piece]]s set during Argentina's pastoral 19th century. These included: ''Santos Vega'' (1916), ''¡Federación o muerte!'' (1917) and ''Milonguita'' (1922).&lt;ref name=tango/&gt;

Having never attended a [[music conservatory]], Corsini once attributed his unmistakable [[falsetto]] to his bucolic pampas upbringing, recalling that ''"birds taught me the spontaneity of their singing, without witnesses and in the great scenery of nature."'' &lt;ref name=tango/&gt;

Corsini also earned renown as a [[Argentine tango|tango]] vocalist, however. Initially avoiding the genre, he included one tango piece, "Un lamento," in a 1920 album. Well received, this recording would remain his sole foray into tango until, in 1922, he was persuaded to premiere "Patotero sentimental" in a [[sainete]] (stage comedy), "El bailarín del cabaret." Corsini secured his standing in the world of tango by popularizing [[Juan de Dios Filiberto]]'s soulful [[Milonga (music)|milonga]], "[[Caminito]]," in 1927. Written as an ode to what was then an oft-used shortcut in the blue-collar [[La Boca]] section of Buenos Aires, "Caminito" remains one of the most recognizable Argentine songs of any genre.&lt;ref name=tango/&gt;

"El Caballero Cantor"—the "gentleman singer," as he was known by then—Corsini was also a composer and lyricist of numerous tangos, such as, among others, "Flor marchita," and "Aquel cantor de mi pueblo" (music by [[guitar]]ist [[Enrique Maciel]]). The latter was immortalized by Corsini's one-time film co-star, [[Edmundo Rivero]]. He also composed in other genres, writing folklore pieces (such as "Tradición gaucha" and "A mi palomita"), and a [[waltz]]: "Tristeza criolla," based on a poem by [[Julián de Charras]].

A 1929 songbook written as an ode to the era of 19th century strongman [[Juan Manuel de Rosas]] by poet [[Héctor Blomberg]] and guitarist [[Enrique Maciel]] featured Corsini as the lead vocalist, a performance considered by critics to have been th highlight of the album.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.todotango.com/english/biblioteca/cronicas/la_pulpera.asp Todo Tango: Ignacio Corsini, the one who saved ''La Pulpera''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090815092159/http://www.todotango.com/english/biblioteca/cronicas/la_pulpera.asp |date=2009-08-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His performance of the album's title track, "La pulpera de Santa Lucía," was critical to its being aired on the [[Communications of Argentina#Radio|radio]]. This return to folklore was followed by similar performances on film, including ''Rapsodia gaucha'' (1932), ''Ídolos de la radio'' (1934, memorable also for a duet between two standards of tango, [[Ada Falcón]] and [[Carlos Gardel]]), and the [[western movie]]-styled ''Fortín alto'' (1941), where he was featured with [[Agustín Irusta]] and a then-unknown [[Edmundo Rivero]].&lt;ref name=tango/&gt;

These successes were dealt a bitter turn by the death of his wife Victoria, on May 28, 1949, following which he retired as a performer. Corsini penned his memoirs the following year, in which he wrote that ''"in her I found the great partner of all my life, who encouraged me in my uncertain hours and to whom I owe a great part of my success"'' (the autobiography was never published).&lt;ref name=tango/&gt;

Corsini reappeared in 1961 for a Channel 7 special, "Volver a vivir" ("To Live Again"). This would be his last public performance, however, and on July 26, 1967, the 'gentleman singer' died at age 76.

==Life==

===Early years===
Dölling was born during the [[Second World War]] in [[Leicester]] in [[England]]&lt;ref name=BiographischeDatenbankenID/&gt; with political refugees as parents.&lt;ref name=WegeindieSozID&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=9_KHUfEjd7QC&amp;pg=PA116&amp;lpg=PA116&amp;dq=%22Irene+D%C3%B6lling%22+Leicester&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=jQvGfvBmAI&amp;sig=AUs9PzhAH56uPGGe5l1M4KXAsCo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=980BVafnKabD7gaXkYHoCA&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Irene%20D%C3%B6lling%22%20Leicester&amp;f=false| title=Arbeiten zwischen den Diziplinen| author1=Irene Dölling| work=Wege in die Soziologie und die Frauen- und Geschlechterforschung:  Autobiographische Notizen der ersten Generation von Professorinnen an der Universität|author2= Ulrike Vogel (editor)|date= 2006|accessdate=12 March 2015|publisher=Springer-Verlag GmbH, Heidelberg,Zweigniederlassung der Springer-Verlag GmbH, Berlin (also seems to be accessible online using Google books at present - March 2015)}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The family were ethnic Germans as well as members of the [[Communist Party of Czechoslovakia|Communist Party]].&lt;ref name=WegeindieSozID/&gt;   They had campaigned actively against [[Nazism]] during the 1930s, and had been living in what was at the time [[Czechoslovakia]] with Czechoslovak passports.  However, in 1938 [[Nazi Germany]] started a project through the use of military force to incorporate Czechoslovakia into an enlarged German state.&lt;ref name=WegeindieSozID/&gt;  The Döllings fled to Britain in 1939.&lt;ref name=WegeindieSozID/&gt;

Her father had worked in the textiles industry before the war (and would return to the trade when he was able to return to the European mainland).&lt;ref name=WegeindieSozID/&gt;   Her mother's work lied in the garment industry.&lt;ref name=BiographischeDatenbankenID/&gt;  Irene Dölling would later recall that her mother, as the eldest of six children, had been forced to cut her schooling short when her mother (Irene's grandmother) fell ill, and the eldest daughter was called upon to look after the family.&lt;ref name=WegeindieSozID/&gt;

===Soviet occupation zone/German Democratic Republic===
Dölling was not yet 3 when the war ended in May 1945. During a period of [[Expulsion of Germans from Czechoslovakia|wholesale ethnic cleansing]] there was no longer any question of the German speaking Dölling family returning to Czechoslovakia, where they had lived until 1939. Instead, they established themselves in the [[Soviet occupation zone]] of what remained of Germany.&lt;ref name=WegeindieSozID/&gt; By 1946 her father had returned to work in the textiles industry, and Irene Dölling grew up as one of two children in a family home that she later remembers as "bookish and intellectually stimulating."&lt;ref name=WegeindieSozID/&gt;  Meanwhile, the Soviet occupation zone formally became the [[German Democratic Republic]] in October 1949. A stand-alone East German state [[Group of Soviet Forces in Germany|sponsored]] by the [[Soviet Union]] on which its [[One-party state|one-]] [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|party]] [[Constitution of East Germany|constitutional]] arrangements were modelled. It was here that Dölling made her life until the separate East German [[Die Wende|state dissolved]] in [[German reunification|1989/90]].   In 1961 Dölling passed her school [[Abitur]] final exams in [[Berlin]].&lt;ref name=BiographischeDatenbankenID/&gt;

Between 1961 and 1966 she studied [[Library science]] and [[Philosophy]] at Berlin's [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Humboldt University]].&lt;ref name=BiographischeDatenbankenID/&gt;   The library science represented a job ticket, but the philosophy became a lasting interest.   Philosophy at this time was taught within the framework of [[Marxism]] as officially defined.&lt;ref name=WegeindieSozID/&gt;   After obtaining her degree she remained at the Humboldt as a research assistant and working for her doctorate which she received in 1970.&lt;ref name=BiographischeDatenbankenID/&gt;   Her dissertation was entitled "On Marxist theories of the driving forces of the practical behaviours of individuals: some preconditions of socialist cultural theory and society".&lt;ref&gt;''"Zur marxistischen Theorie der Triebkräfte praktischgeistigen Verhaltens der Individuen : Zu einigen Voraussetzgn d. Kulturtheorie d. sozialist. Gesellschaft "''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DNBIDProm&gt;{{cite web |url=https://portal.dnb.de/opac.htm?method=showFullRecord&amp;currentResultId=%22106719939%22%26any&amp;currentPosition=15 |title=Katalog der Deutschen Nationalbibliothek |publisher=Deutsche Nationalbibliothek, Frankfurt am Main|date=1970|accessdate=13 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Her [[Habilitation]] followed in 1976.&lt;ref name=BiographischeDatenbankenID/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''"Die kulturtheoretische Konzeption der Persönlichkeit : zur Rolle der biologischen Konstitution im Prozess der Persönlichkeitsentwicklung; weltanschauliche und methodologische Aspekte"''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DNBIDHab&gt;{{cite web |url=https://portal.dnb.de/opac.htm?method=showFullRecord&amp;currentResultId=%22106719939%22%26any&amp;currentPosition=14 |title=Katalog der Deutschen Nationalbibliothek |publisher=Deutsche Nationalbibliothek, Frankfurt am Main|date=1975|accessdate=13 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Irene Dölling stayed at the Humboldt, subject to a couple of brief breaks, right up till 1994.   In 1985 she was appointed Professor for [[Culture theory]] in the university's [[Cultural studies]] and [[Aesthetics]] Department.&lt;ref name=BiographischeDatenbankenID/&gt;  By this time she had already started to focus on gender relations and the position of women in East German society.&lt;ref name=EUComID/&gt;   The slaughter of the [[Second World War|war]] had left Germany with a shortage of working age citizens which in the case of [[East Germany]] was exacerbated during the 1940/50s by the emigration of several million working-age East Germans to [[West Germany|the west]].&lt;ref&gt;"In the period between the Second World War and 1961, a total of 3.8 million people emigrated from East to West Germany." Laar, M. (2009). "The Power of Freedom. Central and Eastern Europe after 1945." Centre for European Studies, p. 58. {{cite web|url=http://www.poweroffreedombook.com/preview_PoF.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-04-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111025246/http://www.poweroffreedombook.com/preview_PoF.pdf |archivedate=2013-11-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Partly as a result of this, female participation in the work force was relatively high in the [[German Democratic Republic]], which correlated with a commensurate increased level of economic (though not, at least at higher levels, political) status and empowerment for women.   By the time Dölling's research interests came to focus on gender issues, roughly 90% of women of working age, supported by state organised child care provision, were in full-time employment.&lt;ref name=UniPotID/&gt;   [[German reunification]], formally enacted in 1990, threw into sharp focus a contrast with he situation in (what had till then been) [[West Germany]] where a far higher proportion of women of working age stayed at home looking after families; and if they were in paid employment, often working only part-time.   Many feminist academics expressed a preference for the work/life balance on offer to women in pre-1990 East Germany, but in any case, as equalisation between the two halves of the country came about during the 1990s, there was no shortage of research topics for the academic staff and students in the [[Women's studies]] departments.&lt;ref name=UniPotID/&gt;

===German Federal Republic===
Irene Dölling co-founded, with {{Interlanguage link multi|Hildegard Maria Nickel|de}}, the [[:de:Zentrum für transdisziplinäre Geschlechterstudien|Centre for cross-disciplinary gender studies (ZtG / ''Zentrum für transdisziplinäre Geschlechterstudien'')]]&lt;ref name=wasbedeutetZtG&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.gender.hu-berlin.de/zentrum|title=Das Zentrum für transdisziplinäre Geschlechterstudien |publisher=ZtG, Berlin|date=30 May 2013|accessdate=13 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Humboldt University]] in on 8 December 1989.   In 1990 she became the Centre's first Research Director.&lt;ref name=BiographischeDatenbankenID/&gt;

In 1994 she finally moved, albeit not very far away, becoming Professor for [[Women's studies]] at the Economic and Social Sciences faculty at the [[University of Potsdam]].&lt;ref name=BiographischeDatenbankenID/&gt;   She remained here till her retirement in 2008.&lt;ref name=UniPotID/&gt;   In addition to her teaching, she continued to publish her own work&lt;ref name=DNBIDGes&gt;{{cite web |url=https://portal.dnb.de/opac.htm?method=simpleSearch&amp;query=106719939|title=Katalog der Deutschen Nationalbibliothek |publisher=Deutsche Nationalbibliothek, Frankfurt am Main|date=1970|accessdate=13 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as serving on the scientific advisory boards of various academic journals in Germany&lt;ref name=RosLuxID&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rosalux.de/stiftung/gremien/wissenschaftlicher-beirat.html|title=Wissenschaftlicher Beirat|publisher=Rosa-Luxemburg-Stiftung: Gesellschaftsanalyse und politische Bildung e.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5839">'''James Leander Cathcart''' (1 June 1767 – 6 October 1843) was a diplomat, [[Arab slave trade|slave]], and sailor. He is notable for his narrative as a slave in [[Algiers]] for eleven years.

==Revolutionary War ==
Cathcart was born in Mount Murragh, [[County Westmeath]], [[Ireland]] and emigrated to the North American colonies at eight years of age, under the care of a relative, Captain John Cathcart. He joined the [[American Revolution]] and at the age of twelve served on a [[privateer]]. Three years later, as a midshipman on ''The Confederacy'', he was captured by the British and imprisoned on the [[Prison ship|prisoner ships]], ''The Good Hope'' and {{HMS|Jersey|1736|2}} from which he escaped in 1782. He became fluent in Spanish and French, which he learned from fellow prisoners during his three-year internment.

== Slave in Algiers ==
In 1785 [[Barbary pirates]] captured the American merchant ship ''The Maria Boston'', on its way to Cadiz carrying furs, lumber, and dried codfish. They took Cathcart and twenty other sailors as [[Slavery|slaves]]. During the eleven years of his slavery in [[Algiers]] Cathcart managed by means of good fortune, cleverness, and bribery to improve his circumstances, eventually becoming chief clerk to the [[Dey]].&lt;ref&gt;Sears, Christine. [http://teachinghistory.org/best-practices/examples-of-historical-thinking/24298 The Barbary Pirates: Letter from Tripoli] [http://www.teachinghistory.org Teachinghistory.org]. Accessed 3 June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  In this position, he acted as a mediator between the [[Dey]] and Joseph Donaldson, Jr. agent for Colonel [[David Humphreys (soldier)|David Humphreys]], the U.S. Minister to Portugal, that resulted in [[The Treaty of Algiers of 1796]] and made possible his freedom.

Cathcart, for the first several years of his captivity, endured the same terrible living conditions as his fellow slaves.  One of a few handpicked by the [[Dey]], Cathcart’s first duties were to work in the Dey’s palace garden caring for the lions, tigers, and antelopes. Although his assigned duties were relatively light, his masters provided scant food and administered several beatings, called [[bastinado]], where in one instance Cathcart lost several of his toenails.

As his fortunes and positions in [[Algiers]] improved, Cathcart acquired additional skills that he used later as a diplomat.  He found opportunities to demonstrate his concern for his fellow prisoners. During his slavery he became conversant in Arabic and Turkish. When Cathcart became clerk of the prison, he was able to buy several taverns, a house with servants, and procure more food for his fellow crew members. After the Treaty of Algiers freed them, Cathcart had the means to purchase a ship, which he sailed to Philadelphia in 1796 with twelve surviving members of the original crew.

== Personal==
On 5 June 1798 he married Philadelphia belle Jane Bancker Woodside, and they had twelve children.  His daughter JB Newkirk put together Cathcart’s narrative and published it in 1899, 56 years after his death, under the title of ''The Captives, Eleven Years a Prisoner in Algiers''.

== Professional diplomatic career==
He returned to the [[Barbary Coast]] in December 1798, as special agent to [[William Eaton (soldier)|William Eaton]]. In 1802, he was appointed [[Consul (representative)|US Consul]] to [[Tunis]] and [[Tripoli]]. He participated in the negotiation of additional treaties with [[Algiers]], Tunis, and Tripoli. He served as [[Consul (representative)|Consul-General]] for the United States in [[Cádiz]] from 1807–17, where he operated a merchant business with [[Richard Worsam Meade I|Richard Worsam Meade]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media|last=Atzbach|first=Nicole|date=2016|title=Portraits in Conversation: Francisco de Goya and Vicente López y Portaña|type=lecture|url=https://youtube.com/watch?v=EE0uT5tOAEU&amp;t=40m16s|access-date=September 17, 2018|time=40m16s|publisher=[[Meadows Museum]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cathcart served in the diplomatic corps for the United States during the administrations of [[John Adams]], [[Thomas Jefferson]], and [[James Madison]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2010">Rev Sir '''James Marchant''' [[FRSE]] FLS FRAS KBE LLD (1867-1956) was a British [[Eugenics|eugenicist]], social reformer and author. He was leader of the [[National Vigilance Association]], concerned with social morality, and also the Director of the [[National Council of Public Morals]]. He epitomises the view of the priggish Victorian attitude to sex and morality.&lt;ref&gt;Edwardian Turn of Mind, Samuel Hynes&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==

He was born in [[London]] on 18 December 1867.

==Animal activism==
During February 2014, Rosales became actively involved in a campaign to Free Mali, the lonely elephant who has been living in a small, concrete enclosure at the [[Manila Zoo]] for more that 35 years. The campaign is led by animal rights group [[PETA]] (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) and works toward having Mali transferred to the Boon Lott's Sanctuary in [[Thailand]], where she will be given all of the care and natural surroundings that the Manila Zoo cannot provide her with. Rosales showed his support by posing for a photograph] holding up a sign that reads "JERICHO ROSALES WANTS MALI FREED"."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/350205/showbiz/jericho-rosales-calls-for-mali-the-elephant-s-transfer Jericho Rosales calls for Mali the elephant's transfer], gmanetwork.com; accessed December 15, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John Titor''' is a name  used on several [[Bulletin board system|bulletin boards]] during 2000 and 2001 by a poster claiming to be an American military [[time travel]]er from 2036.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://johntitor.com/Pages/Story.html|title=The John Titor Story|work=johntitor.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Alwyn Scott"&gt;{{cite book|last=Scott|first=Alwyn|title=The nonlinear universe: chaos, emergence, life|year=26 Sep 2007|publisher=Springer|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c91SqmJteo8C&amp;lpg=PA121&amp;ots=sMCm5rvTi9&amp;pg=PA121#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|isbn=978-3-540-34152-9|page=121}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Titor made numerous vague and specific predictions regarding calamitous events in 2004 and beyond, including a nuclear war, none of which came true. Subsequent closer examination of Titor's assertions provoked widespread skepticism. Inconsistencies in his explanations, the uniform inaccuracy of his predictions, and a private investigator's findings all led to the general impression that the entire episode was an elaborate [[hoax]].  A 2009 investigation concluded that Titor was likely the creation of  Larry Haber, a [[Florida]] entertainment lawyer, along with his brother Morey, a computer scientist.&lt;ref name="Telegraph"&gt;Who was John Titor, the time traveler who came from 2036 to warn us of a nuclear war? [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/science/11945420/Who-was-John-Titor-the-time-traveller-who-came-from-2036-to-warn-us-of-a-nuclear-war.html Telegraph.co.uk], retrieved April 22, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Titor's posts ==

The first posts using John Titor's military symbol appeared on the ''Time Travel Institute'' forums on November 2, 2000, under the name ''TimeTravel_0''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://timetravelinstitute.github.io/TTI-Archive//threads/time-travel-paradoxes.943/#post-9496 The original John Titor thread]&lt;/ref&gt; At that time the name "John Titor" was not being used. The posts discussed time travel in general, the first one being the "six parts" description of what a time machine would need to have to work (see below) and responses to questions about how such a machine would work. Early messages tended to be short. A second thread was also made due to shortcomings in the forum software at the time.&lt;ref&gt;https://timetravelinstitute.github.io/TTI-Archive/threads/topics-limited-to-11-pages.1016/ John Titor's second thread&lt;/ref&gt;

The name "John Titor" was not introduced until January 2001, when TimeTravel_0 began posting at the [[Art Bell]] BBS Forums (which required a name or [[pseudonym]] for every account). The Titor posts ended in late March 2001.

Around 2003, various websites reproduced Titor's posts, re-arranging them into narratives. Not all refer to the original dates posted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.johntitor.com|title=John Titor – Time Traveler|accessdate=2007-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:IBM 5100 - MfK Bern.jpg|thumb|right|IBM 5100 computer]]
In his online postings, Titor claimed to be an American soldier from 2036, based in [[Tampa, Florida]]. He was assigned to a governmental time-travel project, and sent back to 1975 to retrieve an [[IBM 5100]] computer, which he said was needed to [[debug]] various legacy computer programs in 2036 – a possible reference to the [[UNIX]] [[year 2038 problem]].&lt;ref name="Telegraph"/&gt; The IBM 5100 runs the [[APL (programming language)|APL]] and [[BASIC]] programming languages.

Titor said he had been selected for this mission specifically, given that his paternal grandfather was directly involved with the assembly and programming of the 5100.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.postbulletin.com/tangent-the-time-warp/article_c762cd83-e010-5b35-9362-519c8a7924fc.html|title=TANGENT The time warp|last=Stephenson|first=Patrick|work=[[Post-Bulletin]]|date=December 4, 2004|accessdate=August 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In support of this, he described unpublicized features of the 5100, leading to assumptions that a computer scientist was behind the postings.&lt;ref name="Telegraph"/&gt; Titor claimed to be on a stopover in the year 2000 for "personal reasons",&lt;ref name="Telegraph"/&gt; to collect pictures lost in the (future) civil war and to visit his family, of whom he spoke often.

Titor also said he had been, for a few months, trying to alert anyone that would listen about the threat of [[Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease]] spread through beef products and about the possibility of civil war within the United States. When questioned about them by an online subscriber, Titor also expressed an interest in mysteries such as [[UFO]]s, which remained unexplained in his time. Titor suggested that UFOs and [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrials]] might be travelers from much further into the future than his own time, with superior time machines.

=== Time machine ===

Titor described his time machine on several occasions. In an early post, he described it as a "stationary mass, temporal displacement unit powered by two top-spin, dual positive singularities", producing a "standard off-set [[Frank J. Tipler|Tipler]] sinusoid".&lt;ref name="Telegraph"/&gt;

The earliest post was more explicit, saying it contained the following:
* Two magnetic housing units for the dual micro singularities
* An electron injection [[manifold]] to alter mass and gravity of the micro [[Gravitational singularity|singularities]]
* A cooling and [[X-ray]] venting system
* Gravity sensors, or a variable gravity lock
* Four main [[cesium clock]]s
* Three main computer units

According to the posts, the device was installed in the rear of a 1967 [[Chevrolet Corvette]] convertible&lt;ref name=tnr&gt;{{cite web|url=https://newrepublic.com/article/116091/physicists-searched-internet-time-travelers|title=Two Physicists are Looking for Time Travelers on Facebook|last=Steadman|first=Ian|work=[[The New Republic]]|date=January 3, 2014|accessdate=August 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later mentioned a 1987 truck having four-wheel drive.&lt;ref name="Telegraph"/&gt;

Titor shared several scans of the manual of a "C204 Time Displacement Unit" with diagrams and schematics and posted some photographs of the device installed in the car.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/ciencia/time_travel/johntitor03.htm|title=John Titor's Time Machine|website=www.bibliotecapleyades.net|access-date=2018-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Predictions ===
Although invoking the [[Multiverse#Level III: Many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics|many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics]], whereby events from his timeline may differ from our own, Titor also expressed assurance that the differences were minimal.  As such, his descriptions have been interpreted as predictions and compared with historical events since 2001.

The most immediate of Titor's predictions was of an [[Second American Revolution|upcoming civil war]] in the United States having to do with "order and rights".&lt;ref name="John Titor, 2/27/01 17:25"&gt;John Titor, 2/27/01 17:25&lt;/ref&gt; He described it as beginning in 2004,&lt;ref name="John Titor, 2/1/01 8:36"&gt;John Titor, 2/1/01 8:36&lt;/ref&gt; with [[civil unrest]] surrounding the [[United States presidential election, 2004|presidential election of that year]]. This civil conflict that he characterized as "having a [[Waco Siege|Waco]] type event every month that steadily gets worse"&lt;ref name="John Titor, 2/1/01 8:36" /&gt; would be "pretty much at everyone's doorstep"&lt;ref name="John Titor, 2/27/01 17:25" /&gt; and erupt by 2008.

As a result of the war, the United States would split into five regions based on various factors and differing military objectives. This civil war, according to Titor, would end in 2015 with a brief but intense [[World War III]].

Titor refers to the exchange as "N Day". [[Washington, D.C.]] and [[Jacksonville, Florida]] are specifically mentioned as being hit. After the war, [[Omaha, Nebraska|Omaha]], [[Nebraska]] would be the new U.S. capital. Titor was vague as to the exact motivations and causes for World War III. At one point, he characterized the hostilities as being led by "border clashes and overpopulation".&lt;ref&gt;John Titor, 2/8/01 9:40&lt;/ref&gt; He also pointed to the contemporary conflict between Arabs and Israel as not a cause, but rather a milestone that precedes a World War III.

Titor claimed that as a 13-year-old in 2011, he joined the Fighting Diamondbacks, a shotgun infantry unit in Florida, for at least four years. In other posts, he described himself as hiding from the war.

Titor claimed that the "Everett–Wheeler model of quantum physics", better known as the [[many-worlds interpretation]], was correct. According to Titor, this caused a new timestream to form because of his time travel.  This gives his predictions the ability to stand up to scrutiny when they fail to pass, since believers can say that the events were averted by Titor's postings.&lt;ref name="Telegraph"/&gt;

== Criticism and discussion ==
''[[The New Republic]]'' called Titor the most famous of several internet forum posters who claimed to be time travelers.&lt;ref name=tnr/&gt;

An Italian television program, ''Voyager – Ai confini della conoscenza'', aired the results of an investigation of John Titor on May 19, 2008. Private investigator Mike Lynch found no registry evidence, past or present, of any individual named John Titor.  He did, however, identify the John Titor Foundation, a for-profit company formed on September 16, 2003, with no office or address other than a rented post box in [[Kissimmee, Florida]].  An IP address connected with Titor also geolocated to Kissimmee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.voyager.rai.it/category/0,1067207,239-1078499,00.html |title=Rai.it – Voyager – Ai confini della conoscenza |publisher=Voyager |date= |accessdate=2010-09-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722050956/http://www.voyager.rai.it/category/0%2C1067207%2C239-1078499%2C00.html |archivedate=2011-07-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, a report by John Hughston of the Hoax Hunter website named Larry Haber, a Florida entertainment lawyer, as the CEO of the foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hoaxhunter.blogspot.com/2009/02/john-titor-aka-razimus-report_13.html|title=JOHN TITOR A.K.A.

== In popular culture ==
* In 2004, the John Titor Foundation published a book, ''John Titor: A Time Traveler's Tale'' ({{ISBN|1-59196-436-9}}), discussing his claims; the book is now out of print.

On Day 38, Brett was nominated alongside Rachel by Bayleigh (the HOH). On Day 59, he was nominated for eviction alongside Scottie by Faysal. He later won the POV and subsequently vetoed himself off of the block, in which Kaycee was nominated by Faysal in Brett's place. On Day 86, Angela used the Veto on JC and removed him from the block in which Tyler, the HOH, put Brett up as the replacement nominee. Brett was evicted with a 3-0 vote and became the sixth member of the Jury. Brett voted for Tyler to win Big Brother. As the America's Favorite Houseguest award was being announced, he was revealed to be one of the top three votegetters, but lost the contest to Tyler.

==Faysal==

In Week One, he was deemed to be the least trending Houseguest, and was thus required to choose a Crap App, in which he selected Hamazon. On Day 31, Faysal won his second POV of the season. He took Haleigh off of the block, and HOH Sam nominated Rockstar in her place. On Day 58, he won HOH, and on the following day (Day 59), nominated Brett and Scottie to be marked for eviction. Upon Brett winning the POV and removing himself from the block, Faysal opted to place Kaycee up as the replacement nominee. On Day 66, Faysal was nominated alongside Haleigh by Angela, the HOH. On Day 72, he was evicted from the Big Brother house on a 4-1 vote, with only Sam voting to evict Haleigh.

'''Notable [[orphan]]s and [[Child abandonment|foundlings]]''' include world leaders, celebrated writers, entertainment greats, figures in science and business, as well as innumerable fictional characters in literature and comics. While the exact [[Orphan#Definitions|definition of orphan]] varies, one legal definition is a child bereft through "death or disappearance of, abandonment or desertion by, or separation or loss from, both parents".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uscis.gov/portal/site/uscis/menuitem.5af9bb95919f35e66f614176543f6d1a/?vgnextoid=17f496981298d010VgnVCM10000048f3d6a1RCRD&amp;vgnextchannel=063807b03d92b010VgnVCM10000045f3d6a1RCRD Iii.

[[Image:Dackestatyn Virserum 20060803.jpg|thumb|300 px|Statue of Nils Dacke in [[Virserum]]]]
'''Nils Dacke''' was a [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[yeoman]] who was the leader of a mid-16th century peasant revolt in [[Småland]], southern [[Sweden]], called the [[Dacke War]] (Swedish: ''Dackefejden''), fought against the [[King of Sweden|Swedish king]] [[Gustav I]] [[Vasa family|Vasa]]. It was the most widespread and serious civil war in Swedish history and almost toppled the king.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tacitus.nu/svenskhistoria/kungar/vasa/gv-5.htm ''Den tyska perioden och Dackefejden'' (Tacitus.Nu)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[Gustav Vasa]] had come to power at the head of a [[peasant]] army in 1523. He had established Sweden's independence from [[Denmark]] and made Protestantism the national religion. Småland found itself on the border between Sweden and Denmark and was hard hit by Vasa's ban on cross-border trade. In addition, the heavyhanded way in which the church was reformed and the increasing tax burden led to much dissatisfaction among the poor peasants. Already in 1536, Nils Dacke was tried at a local court for killing a [[sheriff]]; according to court records he was fined 10 [[oxen]].

==The Dacke War==
The uprising started in June 1542 with the assassination of more sheriffs and tax collectors. Gustav Vasa underestimated the military prowess of the peasants and sent his German [[mercenary|mercenaries]] to quell the revolt. The [[landsknecht]]s were, however, unsuited for battle in the rugged forests and suffered heavy losses. Dacke had devised defensive tactics that allowed the peasants to use their steel [[crossbow]]s with devastating effect. Dacke's successes helped spread the revolt over all the southern provinces of Sweden. The situation was so serious that the king was forced to sue for peace, and a one-year [[ceasefire]] was signed on 8 November. During the ceasefire, Dacke was the de facto ruler of most of southern Sweden and received offers of foreign support from the [[Elector Palatine]] [[Frederick II, Elector Palatine|Frederick II]] (who was the son-in-law of [[Christian II]] and claimed the Swedish throne) and Duke Albrecht of [[Mecklenburg]]. He reinstated the ceremonies of the Roman Catholic Church and reopened the cross-border trade in the areas under his control. With Danish support Gustav Vasa mounted an invasion of Mecklenburg which neutralised the German threat.

The king broke the ceasefire in January 1543 and sent a new and larger army into the rebellious area. Royal propaganda had been spread to win over the population and turn them against Dacke. Dacke himself had become overconfident after earlier successes and met the Royal army in a [[pitched battle]] in March. The trained soldiers fighting on their own terms shattered the peasant army, and Dacke was severely injured. After this defeat, the rebellion was effectively over and Dacke became an [[outlaw]].

==Death==
[[File:NilsDackeshuvud.JPG|thumb|Nils Dacke´s severed head. Drawing by the 16th-century chronicler [[Joen Petri Klint]].]]
Dacke was shot and killed in the high summer of 1543 in the forests which, at the time, surrounded the southeastern border  between Sweden and Denmark (nowadays southern Swedish provinces Småland and [[Blekinge]]). According to contemporary sources, he had been injured in both legs by hits from the king's crossbows during the decisive battle a few months earlier, his forces had been routed, and he was likely trying to escape from the king's mercenaries. There is no doubt that he was killed on the spot.

Dacke was [[posthumous execution|executed posthumously]], quartered, and his limbs were sent for public display in larger communities that had supported him during the rebellion. Gustav Vasa ordered the annihilation of Dacke's entire family, but showed some leniency against those who had given themselves up. Thus, the unity of the realm was restored.

As a result of the war, the king was henceforth more careful when dealing with his subjects. The reliance on foreign mercenaries in the army was reduced in favour of soldiers of Swedish extraction (many of which were recruited in Småland), and this laid the foundation for Sweden's military successes in later wars.

==Legacy==
Today, Nils Dacke is perceived as a Småland freedom hero. His name is often linked to an independent streak in Småland. Statues in memory of him have been erected, including one in [[Virserum]], where the final battle allegedly took place during 1543. The [[:sv:Nils Dacke-partiet|Nils Dacke party]] (''Nils Dacke-partiet'') is a local political party in the county of [[Gnosjö]]. ''[[:sv:M/S Nils Dacke|M/S Nils Dacke]]'' is a vessel, owned by [[:sv:TT-Line|TT-Line]] serving the [[Trelleborg]]-[[Świnoujście]] route. In 1961, a made-for-television film entitled ''Dacke'' was released by Swedish director and screenwriter [[:sv:Bengt Lagerkvist|Bengt Lagerkvist]].

The '''nine sorceresses''' or '''nine sisters''' are a recurring element in [[Arthurian legend]] in variants of the popular [[Nine maidens (mythology)|nine maidens]] theme from world mythologies. Their most important appearances are in [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]]'s introduction of [[Avalon]] and the character that would later become [[Morgan le Fay]], and as the central motif of [[Peredur]]'s story in the ''[[Peredur son of Efrawg]]'' part of the ''[[Mabinogion]]''.

[[Geoffrey of Monmouth]]'s 12-century ''[[Vita Merlini]]'' introduces the magical island of [[Avalon]], the paradisal "Isle of Apples", as ruled by the nine entirely benevolent enchantress-sisters, known as great healers and capable of shape-shifting and other magic: '''Morgen''', '''Moronoe''', '''Mazoe''', '''Gliten''', '''Glitonea''', '''Gliton''', '''Tyronoe''', and either '''Thiten''' and '''Thiton''' or two sisters both named '''Thitis''' of whom one of them distinguished as "best known for her [[cither]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TUpue_j4D5AC&amp;pg=PA32|title=King Arthur's French Odyssey: Avallon in Burgundy|first=Marilyn|last=Floyde|date=2009|publisher=Pegasus Elliot Mackenzie Pu|via=Google Books|page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sisters receive the dying Arthur from [[Taliesin]], delivered to them in a hope they can revive him.&lt;ref name=ga/&gt; Their beautiful, wise and powerful queen, Morgen, would later evolve into [[Morgan le Fay]], Arthur's own sister in later Arthurian tradition, who herself takes the dying Arthur to Avalon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w2Ayg7hw-cgC&amp;pg=PA39|title=Merlin: Knowledge and Power Through the Ages|first=Stephen Thomas|last=Knight|date=2009|publisher=Cornell University Press|via=Google Books|page=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other eight sisters appear only in this text and never return in any known works by other medieval authors.

===Death===
On 24 March 2014 Oleksandr Muzychko was shot dead. There are conflicting stories about how this happened.&lt;ref name=bbcPoliceRaid /&gt; An official inquiry concluded he had shot himself in the heart three times at the end of a police chase.&lt;ref name=bbc-20140402/&gt;

According to Ukrainian MP Oles Doniy,&lt;ref name=bbcPoliceRaid /&gt; a group of unknown armed people arrived in three Volkswagen minivans and kidnapped Muzychko and five other people from a café near [[Rivne]]. They murdered Muzychko behind the café with two gunshots to the heart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ФОТОРЕПОРТАЖ З МІСЦЯ РОЗСТРІЛУ ОЛЕКСАНДРА МУЗИЧКА|url=http://charivne.info/news/Fotoreportazh-z-mistsya-rozstrilu-Oleksandra-Muzichka-}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=KP/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=На Украине убит активист "Правого сектора" Сашко Билый|url=http://vladnews.ru/2014/03/25/78356/na-ukraine-ubili-aktivista-pravogo-sektora-sashko-bilyj.html|accessdate=25 March 2014|newspaper=Vladnews|date=25 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another telling of Doniy's account, a group of attackers forced Muzychko to halt his car, pulled him out of the vehicle, handcuffed him and shot him.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.themoscowtimes.com/news/article/ultranationalist-leader-in-maidan-protests-is-shot-dead-in-ukraine-video/496788.html |title=Ultranationalist Leader in Maidan Protests Is Shot Dead in Ukraine (Video) |last=Dolgov |first=Anna |date=2014-03-25 |publisher=Moscow Times |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6OL2MVd48?url=http://www.themoscowtimes.com/news/article/ultranationalist-leader-in-maidan-protests-is-shot-dead-in-ukraine-video/496788.html |archivedate=2014-03-25 |quote=Ukrainian lawmaker Oleksandr Doniy said on his Facebook page that unknown assailants blocked off Muzychko's car, dragged him out of the vehicle, cuffed his hands behind his back, and shot him twice in the chest. |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.kyivpost.com/content/ukraine/right-sector-coordinator-muzychko-killed-in-ukraines-rivne-340741.html |title=Right Sector coordinator Muzychko killed in Ukraine's Rivne |date=2014-03-25 |publisher=Kyiv Post |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.kyivpost.com%2Fcontent%2Fukraine%2Fright-sector-coordinator-muzychko-killed-in-ukraines-rivne-340741.html&amp;date=2014-03-25 |archivedate=2014-03-25 |quote='Two vehicles cut up his car, after which he was dragged out of his car and forced into one of these vehicles.

'''Peruvians''' ({{lang-es|Peruanos}}) are the citizens of the [[Peru|Republic of Peru]] or their descendants abroad. Peru is a [[Multiethnic society|multiethnic country]] formed by the combination of different groups over five centuries, so people in Peru usually treat their nationality as a citizenship rather than an ethnicity.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} [[Indigenous peoples in Peru|Amerindians]] inhabited Peruvian territory for several millennia before [[Spanish conquest of the Inca Empire|Spanish Conquest]] in the 16th century; according to historian David N. Cook their population decreased from an estimated 5–9 million in the 1520s to around 600,000 in 1620 mainly because of [[infectious disease]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Noble David Cook, ''Demographic collapse: Indian Peru, 1520–1620'', p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Spaniards]] and [[Black people|Africans]] arrived in large numbers under colonial rule, mixing widely with each other and with indigenous peoples. During the Republic, there has been a gradual immigration of European people (specially from [[Spain]] and [[Italy]], and in a less extent from [[France]], [[the Balkans]], [[Portugal]], [[Great Britain]] and [[Germany]]). [[Japan|Japanese]] and [[China|Chinese]] arrived in large numbers at the end of nineteenth century.

With 31.2 million inhabitants according to the [[2017 Peru Census|2017 Census]], Peru is the [[List of South American countries by population|fifth most populous country in South America]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.inei.gob.pe/media/MenuRecursivo/publicaciones_digitales/Est/Lib1539/libro.pdf |title=Perú: Perfil Sociodemográfico |page = 13 |website = Instituto Nacional de Estadística e Informática}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its demographic growth rate declined from 2.6% to 1.6% between 1950 and 2000; population is expected to reach approximately 46 - 51 million in 2050.&lt;ref&gt;Instituto Nacional de Estadística e Informática, ''Perú: Estimaciones y Proyecciones de Población, 1950–2050'', pp. 37–38, 40.&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2017, 79.3% lived in urban areas and 20.7% in rural areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.inei.gob.pe/media/MenuRecursivo/publicaciones_digitales/Est/Lib1539/libro.pdf |title=Perú: Perfil Sociodemográfico |page = 15 |website = Instituto Nacional de Estadística e Informática}}&lt;/ref&gt; Major cities include [[Lima metropolitan area|Lima]], home to over 9.5 million people, [[Arequipa]], [[Trujillo, Peru|Trujillo]], [[Chiclayo]], [[Piura]], [[Iquitos]], [[Huancayo]], [[Cusco]] and [[Pucallpa]], all of which reported more than 250,000 inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.inei.gob.pe/media/MenuRecursivo/publicaciones_digitales/Est/Lib1539/libro.pdf |title=Perú: Perfil Sociodemográfico |page = 27 |website = Instituto Nacional de Estadística e Informática}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The largest expatriate Peruvian communities are in the United States ([[Peruvian Americans]]), [[South America]] ([[Argentina]], [[Chile]], [[Venezuela]] and [[Brazil]]), [[Europe]] (Spain, Italy, France and the United Kingdom), Japan, [[Australia]] and [[Canada]].

==Ethnic structure of Peru==
In the 2017 Census, those of 12 years old and above were asked what ancestral origin they belong too with 60.2% of Peruvians self-identified as [[Mestizos]], 22.3% as [[Quechua people|Quechua]]s, 5.9% as [[White Latin American|White]], 3.6% as [[Afro-Peruvian|Black/Mulatto]], 2.4% as [[Aymara people|Aymara]]s, 0.3% as [[Amazon Basin|Amazonian]]s, 0.1% as [[Chinese Peruvians|Tusán]], 0.1% as [[Japanese diaspora|Nikkei]] and 1.1% as Others.&lt;ref name="census2017"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.inei.gob.pe/media/MenuRecursivo/publicaciones_digitales/Est/Lib1539/libro.pdf |title=Perú: Perfil Sociodemográfico |page = 214 |website = Instituto Nacional de Estadística e Informática}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amerindians are found in the southern [[Andes]], though a large portion, also to be found in the southern and central coast due to the massive internal labor migration from remote Andean regions to coastal cities, during the past four decades.

=== Mestizos ===
[[File:Juan Manuel Vargas (19-02-2011).jpg|thumb|right|160px|[[Juan Manuel Vargas]]]]
'''[[Mestizos]]''' compose 60.2% of the total population. The term traditionally denotes Amerindian and European ancestry (mostly [[Spanish people|Spanish]] ancestry). This term was part of the caste classification used during colonial times, whereby people of exclusive Spanish descent who were born in the colonies were called [[Criollo people|criollos]], people of mixed Amerindian and Spanish descent were called mestizos, those of African and Spanish descent were called [[mulatto]]s, and those of Amerindian and African descent were called [[zambo]]s.
Most mestizos are urban dwellers and show stronger European inheritance in regions like [[Lima Region]], [[La Libertad Region]], [[Callao Region]], [[Cajamarca Region]], [[Piura Region]], [[Lambayeque Region]], and [[Arequipa Region]].

=== Amerindians ===
{{main article|Indigenous peoples in Peru}}
[[File:Alejandro Toledo (8682).jpg|thumb|right|110px|[[Alejandro Toledo]]]]
'''[[Amerindians]]''' constitute 25.7% of the total population.&lt;ref name="census2017"/&gt; The two major [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] or ethnic groups are the [[Quechuas]] (belonging to various cultural subgroups), followed by the [[Aymara people|Aymara]]s, mostly found in the extreme southern Andes. A large proportion of the indigenous population who live in the Andean highlands still speak [[Quechua languages|Quechua]] or [[Aymara language|Aymara]], and have vibrant cultural traditions, some of which were part of the [[Inca Empire]].

Dozens of indigenous cultures are also dispersed throughout the country beyond the [[Andes Mountains]] in the [[Amazon basin]]. This region is rapidly becoming urbanized. Important urban centers include [[Iquitos]], [[Nauta]], [[Puerto Maldonado]], [[Pucallpa]] and [[Yurimaguas]]. This region is home to numerous [[indigenous people]]s, though they do not constitute a large proportion of the total population. Examples of indigenous peoples residing in eastern Peru include the [[Shipibo]], [[Urarina]],&lt;ref&gt;Dean, Bartholomew 2009 ''Urarina Society, Cosmology, and History in Peruvian Amazonia'', Gainesville: University Press of Florida {{ISBN|978-0-8130-3378-5}} [http://www.upf.com/book.asp?id=DEANXS07]&lt;/ref&gt; Cocama, and [[Aguaruna people|Aguaruna]].

=== European ===
{{main article|Peruvians of European descent}}
[[File:Pedro Pablo Kuczynski Godard.jpg|thumb|right|130px|66th President [[Pedro Pablo Kuczynski]].]]
'''[[Peruvian of European descent|European]]''' descendants total 5.9% of the total population. They are mostly descendants of the [[Spanish people|Spanish]] colonizers. And other Europeans such as [[Italian Peruvians|Italians]], [[British Peruvians|British]], [[French Peruvians|French]], [[German Peruvian|Germans]], [[Irish people|Irish]], [[Dutch people|Dutch]], [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]], [[Swiss people|Swiss]], [[Poles]] and [[Croats|Croatians]] (see also [[Croatian Peruvian]]) who arrived in the 19th and 20th centuries. The majority of them live also in the largest cities, usually in the North and Center cities of Peru: [[Lima]], [[Trujillo, Peru|Trujillo]], [[Chiclayo]], and [[Piura]].

The only southern city with a significant white population is [[Arequipa]]. Also [[Oxapampa]] and [[Pozuzo]] in the [[Pasco Region]], and through all [[North macroregion, Peru|Northwest]] (mainly the highlands of the Coast Regions, [[Cajamarca Region]] and part of the [[San Martin Region]]), a considerable white population can be found, mostly descendants of Spanish, German, British, French and Italian settlers. Recently, Peru has seen a migration of American retirees and businessmen come to settle in the country, due to lower cost of living and economic booms from the year 2000 to present.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

=== Asian ===
{{main article|Chinese Peruvians|Japanese Peruvians}}
There is also a large presence of '''[[Asian Peruvian]]s''', primarily [[east Asia]]n [[Chinese Peruvian|Chinese]] and [[Japanese Peruvian|Japanese]] along with more recently arrived [[Filipinos]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csuchico.edu/ncpaso/filipino.htm|title=Filipino American History|work=Northern California Pilipino American Student Organization|publisher=California State University, Chico|date=1999|accessdate=11 January 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19991012012919/http://www.csuchico.edu/ncpaso/filipino.htm|archivedate=12 October 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other Asian immigrants, that constitutes 0.2% of the population. 

Peru has the second largest population of people of Japanese descent in Latin America after [[Brazil]] and the largest population of Chinese descent in [[Latin America]]. Historic communities inhabited by people of Chinese descent are found throughout the Peruvian [[upper Amazon]], including cities such as [[Yurimaguas]], [[Nauta]], [[Iquitos]] and the north central coast (Lambayeque and Trujillo).

In contrast to the Japanese community in Peru, the [[Overseas Chinese|Chinese]] appear to have intermarried much more since they came to work in the [[rice fields]] during the Viceroyalty and to replace the [[Native ethnic groups of Africa|African]] slaves, during the abolition of slavery itself. Despite the presence of Peruvians of Asian heritage being quite recent, in the past decade they have made significant advancements in business and political fields; a past president ([[Alberto Fujimori]]), several past cabinet members, and one member of the Peruvian congress are of Japanese or Chinese origin. Large numbers of [[Arab diaspora|Arab]] Peruvians, mostly of [[Lebanon|Lebanese]], [[Syria]]n and [[Iraqis]] origin and [[Palestinians]] also reside, as well a small [[Jewish]], [[Non-resident Indian and person of Indian origin|Hindustani]] and [[Pakistani people|Pakistani]] communities.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

===Afro-Peruvian===
{{main article|Afro-Peruvians}}
[[File:Schalke Jefferson Farfan 1.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Jefferson Farfán]]]]
The remaining is constituted by '''[[Afro-Peruvian]]s,''' which are around 3.6%&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.inei.gob.pe/media/MenuRecursivo/publicaciones_digitales/Est/Lib1539/libro.pdf |title=Perú: Perfil Sociodemográfico |page = 15 |website = Instituto Nacional de Estadística e Informática}}&lt;/ref&gt; a legacy of Peru's history as an importer of slaves during the colonial period. Today also [[mulatto]]s (mixed African and European) and [[zambos]] (mixed African and Amerindian) constitute an important part of the population as well, especially in [[Piura]], [[Tumbes (city)|Tumbes]], [[Lambayeque, Peru|Lambayeque]], [[Lima]] and [[Ica region|Ica]] regions. The Afro-Peruvian population is concentrated mostly in coastal cities south of Lima, such as that of those found in the Ica Region, in cities like [[Cañete Province|Cañete]], [[Chincha Alta|Chincha]], [[Ica (city)|Ica]], [[Nazca]] and [[Acarí]] in the border with the [[Arequipa Region]].

Another large but poorly promoted segment of Afro-Peruvian presence is in the ''Yunga'' regions (west and just below the Andean chain of northern Peru), (i.e., [[Piura]] and [[Lambayeque, Peru|Lambayeque]]), where sugarcane, lemon, and mango production are still of importance. Important communities are found all over the [[Morropón Province]], such as in the city of [[Chulucanas]]. One of them is Yapatera, a community in the same city, as well as smaller farming communities like Pabur or [[La Matanza Partido|La Matanza]] and even in the mountainous region near Canchaque. Further south, the colonial city of Zaña or farming towns like [[Cappote, Peru|Capote]] and [[Tuman (Peru district)|Tuman]] in [[Lambayeque, Peru|Lambayeque]] are also important regions with Afro-Peruvian presence.

===Immigration after independence===
{{Main article|Immigration to Peru}}
After independence, there has been a gradual [[European ethnic groups|European]] immigration from England, France, Germany, Italy, Austria, Croatia and Spain.&lt;ref&gt;Mario Vázquez, "Immigration and mestizaje in nineteenth-century Peru", pp. 79–81.&lt;/ref&gt;

Polynesians also came to the country lured to work in the Guano islands during the boom years of this commodity around the 1860s. [[Overseas Chinese|Chinese]] arrived in the 1850s as a replacement for slave workers in the sugar plantations of the north coast and have since become a major influence in Peruvian society.&lt;ref&gt;Magnus Mörner, ''Race mixture in the history of Latin America'', p. 131.&lt;/ref&gt; Other immigrant groups include [[Arabs]], [[South Asians]], [[Japanese people|Japanese]] and [[United States|Americans]] from the United States.

==Languages==
{{see also|Peruvian Spanish}}

Every year, in October, hundreds of thousands of faithful from all races and economic backgrounds dresses in purple to celebrate the also known "Black Christ" in a religious procession through the streets of Lima. Without doubt the earthquakes by Lima during the 17th and 18th Centuries, which destroyed most of the city leaving only that mural standing up, contributed to the growth and the solidification of devoted veneration to the mural known as "Christ of Pachacamilla".

{{Main article|Culture of Peru}}
Peruvian culture is primarily rooted in [[Amerindian]] and Spanish traditions,&lt;ref&gt;Víctor Andrés Belaunde, ''Peruanidad'', p. 472.&lt;/ref&gt; though it has also been influenced by various African, Asian, and European ethnic groups. [[Peruvian arts|Peruvian artistic traditions]] date back to the elaborate pottery, textiles, jewelry, and sculpture of [[Pre-Inca cultures]]. The Incas maintained these crafts and made [[Architecture of Peru|architectural]] achievements including the construction of [[Machu Picchu]]. [[Baroque]] dominated colonial art, though modified by native traditions.{{sfn|Bailey|2005|pp=72–74}} During this period, most art focused on religious subjects; the numerous churches of the era and the paintings of the [[Cuzco School]] are representative.{{sfn|Bailey|2005|p=263}} Arts stagnated after independence until the emergence of ''[[Indigenismo]]'' in the early 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Lucie-Smith, ''Latin American art of the 20th century'', pp. 76–77, 145–146.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 1950s, Peruvian art has been [[Eclecticism in art|eclectic]] and shaped by both foreign and local art currents.{{sfn|Bayón|Concha|Martin|1998|pp=425–428|ps=: In Bayón "Art, 1920–c.1980"}}

===Literature===
[[Peruvian literature]] has its roots in the oral traditions of [[pre-Columbian]] civilizations. Spaniards introduced writing in the 16th century; colonial literary expression included [[chronicle]]s and [[Christian literature|religious literature]]. After independence, [[Costumbrism]] and [[Romanticism]] became the most common literary genres, as exemplified in the works of [[Ricardo Palma]].{{sfn|Bayón|Concha|Martin|1998|pp=37–39|ps=: In Martin "Literature, music and the visual arts, c. 1820–1870"}} In the early 20th century, the ''Indigenismo'' movement produced such writers as [[Ciro Alegría]],{{sfn|Bayón|Concha|Martin|1998|pp=151–152|ps=: In Martin "Narrative since 1920"}} [[José María Arguedas]],{{sfn|Bayón|Concha|Martin|1998|pp=178–179|ps=: In Martin "Narrative since 1920"}} and [[César Vallejo]].{{sfn|Bayón|Concha|Martin|1998|pp=250–253|ps=: In Concha "Poetry 1920–1950"}} During the second half of the century, Peruvian literature became more widely known because of authors such as [[List of Nobel laureates in Literature|Nobel laureate]] [[Mario Vargas Llosa]], a leading member of the [[Latin American Boom]].{{sfn|Bayón|Concha|Martin|1998|pp=186–188|ps=: In Martin "Narrative since 1920"}} [[María Jesús Alvarado Rivera]] was a Peruvian rebel feminist, educator, journalist, writer and social activist who was noted by the National Council of Women of Peru in 1969 as the "first modern champion of women's rights in Peru".&lt;ref name="EncWomSocRef2001"&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Women Social Reformers: A-L-v. 2.

===Cuisine===
[[Peruvian cuisine]] is a blend of [[Native American cuisine of South America|Amerindian]] and [[Spanish food]] with strong influences from African, Arab, Italian, Chinese, and Japanese cooking.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tony Custer]], ''The Art of Peruvian Cuisine'', pp. 17–22.&lt;/ref&gt; Common dishes include ''[[anticuchos]]'', ''[[ceviche]]'' and ''[[pachamanca]]''. Because of the variety of climates within Peru, a wide range of plants and animals are available for cooking.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tony Custer]], ''The Art of Peruvian Cuisine'', pp. 25–38.&lt;/ref&gt; Peruvian cuisine has recently received acclaim due to its diversity of ingredients and techniques.&lt;ref&gt;Embassy of Peru in the United States, [https://web.archive.org/web/20080429211108/http://www.peruvianembassy.us/do.php?p=507 ''The Peruvian Gastronomy''].

[[Peruvian music]] has Andean, Spanish and African roots.&lt;ref&gt;Raúl Romero, "Andean Peru", p. 385–386.&lt;/ref&gt; In pre-Hispanic times, musical expressions varied widely from region to region; the ''[[quena]]'' and the ''[[tinya]]'' were two common instruments.&lt;ref&gt;Dale Olsen, ''Music of El Dorado'', pp. 17–22.&lt;/ref&gt; Spanish conquest brought the introduction of new instruments such as the guitar and the harp, as well as the development of crossbred instruments like the ''[[charango]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Turino, "Charango", p. 340.&lt;/ref&gt; African contributions to Peruvian music include its rhythms and the ''[[Cajon|cajón]]'', a percussion instrument.&lt;ref&gt;Raúl Romero, "La música tradicional y popular", pp. 263–265.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peruvian folk dances]] include ''[[marinera]]'', ''[[tondero]]'' and ''[[huayno]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Raúl Romero, "La música tradicional y popular", pp. 243–245, 261–263.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pompeia Plotina Claudia Phoebe Piso''' or '''Pompeia Plotina''' (d. 121/122) was a Roman Empress and wife of [[Roman Emperor]] [[Trajan]]. She was renowned for her interest in philosophy, and her virtue, dignity and simplicity. She was particularly devoted to the [[Epicureanism|Epicurean]] philosophical school in [[Athens]], [[Greece]].&lt;ref name=school&gt;Simon Hornblower and Anthony Spawforth-E.A. (edd.), ''[[Oxford Classical Dictionary]],'' [[Oxford University Press]], 2003, p. 1214.&lt;/ref&gt; She is often viewed as having provided Romans with fairer taxation, improved education, assisted the poor, and created tolerance in Roman society.

== Life ==
Plotina was born and was raised in Tejada la Vieja ([[Escacena del Campo]]) in the province of [[Hispania]], possibly during the reign of Roman Emperor [[Nero]] (r. 54–68). However, she could have been born in the 70s CE. She was the daughter of Lucius Pompeius and Plotia, who had extensive political and familial connections. Trajan married her before his accession and, although a happy marriage, they had no known children.

Upon entering the imperial palace following Trajan's ascension, Plotina is said to have turned to those watching her and carefully announced, "I enter here the kind of woman I would like to be when I depart."&lt;ref&gt;[[Dio Cassius]], LXVIII, 5&lt;/ref&gt; It was through acts like this she sought to dispel the bad taste of domestic strife that had characterized the reign of [[Domitian]] as well as the [[Julio-Claudian dynasty]], where she acted like a traditional Roman matron, and was associated with chaste goddesses like [[Vesta (mythology)|Vesta]], the guardian of Rome's sacred fire, and [[Minerva]], goddess of war and wisdom.&lt;ref&gt;Annalise Freisenbruch, ''Caesars’ Wives: Sex, Power, and Politics in the Roman Empire'' (London and New York: Free Press, 2010), pp. 159-161&lt;/ref&gt; In 100, Trajan awarded her with title of ''[[Augusta (honorific)|Augusta]]'', but she did not accept the title until 105. Plotina did not appear also on the coinage until 112.&lt;ref name=school/&gt;

When the future emperor [[Hadrian]] and his sister lost their parents at 10 or 11 years old, Trajan and the Roman officer [[Publius Acilius Attianus]] became their guardians; Hadrian was a first cousin once removed to Trajan (Trajan's father and Hadrian's paternal grandmother were siblings). Plotina was the matchmaker between Hadrian and his future wife [[Vibia Sabina]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Historia Augusta]]'', "Hadrian", 3; translated by Anthony Birley, ''Lives of the Later Caesars'' (Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1976), p. 59&lt;/ref&gt;

When a letter Trajan was said to have composed on his deathbed appeared in Rome with Plotina's signature on it, in which he adopted Hadrian and naming him successor to the Empire, suspicions were raised. It was rumoured that Attianus and the Empress Plotina had been lovers, both were very fond of Hadrian their ward, both were present at Trajan’s deathbed at [[Selinunte|Selinus]] in [[Sicily|Cilicia]] in August 117, and that the two had helped secure Hadrian's succession by forging Trajan’s will.&lt;ref name="school"/&gt;

Annelise Freisenbruch dismisses this accusation. "Plotina, the silent spouse of the second century, thus joined Livia, Agrippina Minor, and Domitia in the gallery of Roman imperial women accused of covering up or conspiring in their husband's deaths," Freisenbruch acidly writes, noting there are many plausible explanations why Plotina's signature might legitimately be on this declaration: Trajan may have simply been too weak to sign the letter himself. Freisenbruch also notes these kinds of accusations have dogged the spouses of rulers through the centuries, providing two modern examples of these kinds of accusations: in 1919 Edith Wilson was charged with forging the signature of US president [[Woodrow Wilson]] after he was incapacitated by a stroke; and four years later, when president [[Warren Harding]] died from a heart attack, his wife was then accused in a best-selling book of having poisoned him.&lt;ref&gt;Freisenbruch, ''Caesars’ Wives'', pp. 162f&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with Attianus and [[Salonina Matidia|Matidia]], the grieving widow Plotina accompanied Trajan’s body to [[Seleucia Pieria|Seleucia]] and his ashes to Rome.

It was while a widow that Plotina's best documented action took place. During the year 121, while the emperor Hadrian was inspecting the provinces, Plotina and he engaged in a series of letters discussing who should be the new head of the [[Epicurean]] school of philosophy in [[Athens]]. She petitioned for a change in the law, which would allow [[Popillius Theotimus]], the acting head of the school, to become the actual head; in response, Hadrian agreed with her argument, and the relevant letters were preserved in a series of inscriptions. Freisenbruch notes, "In stark contrast to her passive anonymity in the literary record, this inscription from Athens recasts Plotina as a highly educated woman, active on behalf of causes close to her heart and with the kind of access to the emperor once enjoyed by Livia."&lt;ref&gt;Freisenbruch, ''Caesars’ Wives'', pp. 163f&lt;/ref&gt;

When Plotina died of illness, she was [[Imperial cult (Roman Empire)|deified]]. Hadrian built a temple in her honor at [[Nîmes]], in [[Provence]].

In addition to performing, she has her own adult film studio, Savanna Samson Productions. A native of upstate [[New York (state)|New York]], she entered the adult film industry in 2000, after working as a dancer at the [[Manhattan]] strip club, [[Scores New York|Scores]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.scoresny.com/news/page:12 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2016-07-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161004001131/http://www.scoresny.com/news/page:12 |archive-date=2016-10-04 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Samson has gained mainstream recognition with appearances on television shows such as ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', ''[[The Daily Show]]'' and ''[[30 Rock]]''.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1150821/&lt;/ref&gt; Her wide range of activities outside pornography include working as a [[Sex columnist|sex-advice columnist]], a radio presenter and a political correspondent. She also produces her own line of wines, has a recording contract with [[E1 Music]] and is a trained [[ballerina]].

==Early life==
One of five daughters, Samson grew up Roman Catholic in [[Watertown, New York]].&lt;ref name=NewYorkTimes/&gt; She began dancing at a young age and, at 17, moved to [[New York City]] to pursue a career in ballet. However, she eventually gave this up, admitting she "wasn't good enough", and took a job dancing at the [[Manhattan]] strip club Scores,&lt;ref name=NewYorkTimes/&gt; on the recommendation of her sister who worked there. When starting at the club, she chose the stage name Savanna in homage to a character in ''[[The Prince of Tides]]''. The surname Samson, taken from the [[Samson|biblical figure]], was added later in her career to distinguish her from porn actress [[Savannah (actress)|Savannah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.bizarremag.com/sleaze/interviews/1756/savanna_samson.html|title=Sleaze Interview: Savanna Samson|accessdate= 2008-01-16|author= Chris Neiratko|date=April 2005|publisher= ''[[Bizarre (magazine)|Bizarre]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; While at Scores, she met her future husband, wine merchant Daniel Oliveros, with whom she now has a son.

==Adult film career==
Samson's move into the adult film business began in 2000, after she wrote a letter to Italian porn actor and director [[Rocco Siffredi]], asking to work with him. She initially wanted to make a movie in order to fulfill a fantasy, after her husband had given her the idea, and hoped no one she knew would find out. However, after her first movie, ''Rocco Meats An American Angel In Paris'', which was nominated for "Best Foreign Release" at the [[AVN Awards]], she got what she described as "porn fever" and went on to make further movies.&lt;ref name=NewYorkTimes/&gt;&lt;ref name=rock&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rockconfidential.com/Magazine/?p=9655 |title=Exclusive Interview: Savanna Samson|accessdate=2009-06-12|date=2009-06-07|publisher=RockConfidential.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090627192601/http://rockconfidential.com/Magazine/?p=9655 |archivedate=June 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her family soon discovered her film career when she appeared on ''[[The Howard Stern Show]]'' and ''[[Entertainment Tonight]]''. Samson stated in 2006: "My parents are devastated by my career choices".&lt;ref name=NewYorkTimes/&gt;

In April 2002, she signed an exclusive contract with [[Vivid Entertainment]].

==Winemaking==

Despite enjoying her career in the adult film industry, Samson felt it left her unfilled. In 2005, while on vacation in [[Tuscany]], Italy, she decided she could "leave a mark on this world" by making wine.&lt;ref name=NewYorkTimes/&gt; The wife of a wine merchant,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/nypost/access/996225481.html?dids=996225481:996225481&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Mar+02%2C+2006&amp;author=Chris+Wilson&amp;pub=New+York+Post&amp;desc=PAGE+SIX&amp;pqatl=google|title=Page Six|accessdate= 2009-11-17|date= 2006-03-02|publisher= ''New York Post''|author=Edward Duncan}}&lt;/ref&gt; she had frequently traveled to Italy and France, and often fantasized about owning her own vineyard. When she was a child, she had helped her family make wine in their basement.&lt;ref name=rock/&gt;

She formed the company, Savanna Samson Wines, and asked Italian winemaker and consultant Roberto Cipresso to help find a blend of grapes local to Tuscany that would produce her ideal flavor. They eventually chose a mixture of 70 percent [[Cesanese]], 20 percent [[Sangiovese]] and 10 percent [[Montepulciano d'Abruzzo|Montepulciano]], which produced a red wine that she named Sogno Uno, meaning Dream One. Its label played on Samson's notoriety as a porn star, featuring a side view of her wearing only a see-through gown and high heels.&lt;ref name=NewYorkTimes/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.decanter.com/news/71310.html|title=Parker: thumbs up for porn star wine|accessdate= 2009-11-17|date= 2005-11-25|publisher= ''Decanter''|author=Oliver Styles}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wine critic [[Robert M. Parker, Jr.]] gave Sogno Uno a rating of 90 to 91 out of 100, and described it as "awfully good".&lt;ref name=NewYorkTimes/&gt; A gala launch was held for the wine at a Manhattan restaurant on February 27, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://business.avn.com/articles/25580.html|title=New York Times Features Savanna Wine|accessdate= 2009-11-17|date= 2006-02-26|publisher= AVN.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By June 2007, her company had produced a further two wines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://business.avn.com/articles/4971.html|title=Erotica LA: Day One Wrap-Up|accessdate= 2009-11-17|date= 2007-06-23|publisher= AVN.com|author=Nelson X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Shakti Chattopadhyay''' ({{lang-bn|শক্তি চট্টোপাধ্যায়|translit=Shokti Chôţţopaddhae}}) (25 November 1933 – 23 March 1995) was a [[Bengali people|Bengali]] poet and writer.

== Life ==

===Early life===
Shakti Chattopadhyay was born at Baharu village in modern-day [[South 24 Parganas district]], Paschimbanga ([[West Bengal]]), [[India]] to Bamanath Chattopadhyay and Kamala Devi. He lost his father at the age of four and brought up by his maternal grandfather. He came to [[Bagbazar]], [[Calcutta]] in 1948 and got admitted to Maharaja Cossimbazar Polytechnic School in class VIII. Here he was introduced to [[Marxism]] by a teacher. In 1949 he established Pragati Library and started a hand-written magazine, ''Pragati'', which was soon changed into a printed one, changing the name to ''Bahnishikha''. He passed Matriculation Examination in 1951 and got admitted to the [[City College, Kolkata|City College]] to study commerce as his maternal uncle, who was a businessman and also his guardian, promised him a job of an accountant. It was the same year when he got membership of the [[Communist Party of India]] (CPI). In 1953, he passed Intermediate Commerce Examination, but gave up studying commerce and got admitted to the [[Presidency College, Kolkata|Presidency College]] (now [[Presidency University, Kolkata]]) with Honours in [[Bengali literature]] but he did not appear in the examination.

===Early writings===
In 1956, he had to leave his maternal uncle’s home and moved to a slum at [[Ultadanga]] along with his mother and brother. At this time he was solely dependent on the meagre wages of his brother. In March 1956, his poem "Yama" was published in ''Kabita'', a literary magazine published by [[Buddhadeb Bose]]. After that he started writing for ''[[Krittibas (magazine)|Krittibas]]'' and other magazines. Buddhadeb Bose also invited him to join the Comparative Literature course in newly opened [[Jadavpur University]]. He joined the course, but could not complete it either. In 1958, he terminated his relationship with the CPI.

He worked at Saxby Pharma Ltd. as a store assistant and later taught at Bhowanipur Tutorial Home (Harrison Road branch). He also started a business himself and ran it for sometime before he gave up and joined Hind Motors as junior executive. But he could not continue anywhere. He started indulging in a wayward lifestyle and drinking heavily.

===Hungry Generation===
He was one of the founder members of the [[Hungry generation]] movement, along with other prominent writers like [[Malay Roy Choudhury]], [[Samir Roychoudhury]] and [[Debi Roy]].It started with the publication of a one-page bulletin in November 1961. However he left the movement in 1963 due to differences of opinion with the other members.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4599">'''Sir Aubrey (Hunt) de Vere, 2nd Baronet''' (28 August 1788 - 5 July 1846) was an [[Anglo-Irish]] poet and landowner.

De Vere was the son of [[Sir Vere Hunt, 1st Baronet]] and Hon. Eleanor Pery, daughter of [[William Pery, 1st Baron Glentworth]].&lt;ref&gt;ThePeerage.com (entry #84913) http://www.thepeerage.com/p8492.htm#i84913 (Accessed 10 February 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Burke, ''A General and Heraldic Dictionary of the Peerage and Baronetage of the British Empire'' (Volume 1, H. Colburn, 1833), 351.&lt;/ref&gt; He was educated at [[Harrow School]], where he was a childhood friend of [[Lord Byron]], and [[Trinity College, Dublin]]. He married Mary Spring Rice, the daughter of Stephen Edward Rice and Catherine Spring, and sister of [[Thomas Spring Rice, 1st Baron Monteagle of Brandon]], in 1807.&lt;ref&gt;ThePeerage.com (entry #84913) http://www.thepeerage.com/p8492.htm#i84913 (Accessed 10 February 2015)&lt;/ref&gt; He succeeded to his father's title in 1818.

The Hunt/de Vere family estate for 300 years (1657–1957), including the period of the [[De Vere baronets|de Vere Baronetcy of Curragh]], is the present day [[Curraghchase Forest Park]], in [[County Limerick]]. De Vere spent most of his life on the estate and was closely involved in its management. He suffered much trouble from his ownership of  the island of [[Lundy]], which his father, who was not much of a businessman,  had unwisely purchased in 1802, and which became a heavy drain on the family's finances. Sir Vere was never able to find a purchaser for Lundy, and it took his son until 1834 to dispose of it.

Sir Aubrey stood for election in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1820|1820 General Election]] and came in third with 2921 votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Co. Limerick {{!}} History of Parliament Online 1820-32 |url= http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1820-1832/constituencies/co-limerick |website= History of Parliament |accessdate= 5 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He changed his surname from Hunt to de Vere in 1832, in reference to his [[Earl of Oxford]] ancestors, dating back to [[Aubrey de Vere I]], a tenant-in-chief in England of [[William the Conqueror]] in 1086.&lt;ref&gt;John Burke, ''A General and Heraldic Dictionary of the Peerage and Baronetage of the British Empire'' (Volume 1, H. Colburn, 1833), 351.&lt;/ref&gt; He served as [[High Sheriff of County Limerick]] in 1811.

Sir Aubrey was a poet. [[William Wordsworth|Wordsworth]] called his sonnets the most perfect of the age. These and his drama, ''Mary Tudor: An Historical Drama'', were published by his son the poet Mr. [[Aubrey Thomas de Vere]] in 1875 and 1884.

==Works==
De Vere produced numerous works over his lifetime. The most notable are: ''Ode to the Duchess of Angouleme'' (1815), ''Julian the Apostate: A Dramatic Poem'' (1822), ''The Duke of Mercia: An Historical Drama'' [with] ''The Lamentation of Ireland, and Other Poems'' (1823), ''A Song of Faith: Devout Exercises and Sonnets'' and his most famous work, ''Mary Tudor: An Historical Drama''.&lt;ref&gt;‘The Poems of the De Veres’, ''Dublin University Magazine'', XXI, 122 (Feb. 1843), pp.190-204.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''A Book of Irish Verse'', [[W. B. Yeats]] described de Vere's poetry as having "less architecture than the poetry of [[Robert Fergusson|Ferguson]] and [[William Allingham|Allingham]], and more meditation. Indeed, his few but ever memorable successes are enchanted islands in gray seas of stately impersonal reverie and description, which drift by and leave no definite recollection. One needs, perhaps, to perfectly enjoy him, a Dominican habit, a cloister, and a breviary."&lt;ref&gt;‘Modern Irish Poetry’ [prev. in ''A Book of Irish Verse'', 1895, &amp; rep. in] Justin McCarthy, gen. ed., ''Irish Literature'', 1904, Vol. III, p.pp.vii-xiii; p.11.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13690">'''The World's Billionaires 2012''' edition was 26th annual ranking of [[The World's Billionaires]] by ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine.  The list estimated the net worth of the world's richest people, excluding royalty and dictators, as of February 14, 2012.  It was released online on March 7, 2012.

==Annual list==
Telecommunications mogul [[Carlos Slim]] topped the 2012 list, marking this third consecutive year at the top. [[Microsoft]] founder [[Bill Gates]] placed second, but narrowed the gap from 2011 as Slim's fortune fell $5 billion while Gates' rose $5 billion. Investor [[Warren Buffett]] remained in third place. [[Bernard Arnault]] of France was the top-ranking European on the list, placing fourth.&lt;ref name=Telegraph2012 /&gt;  [[Amancio Ortega]] moved up a spot to number five, despite stepping down from [[Zara (retailer)|Zara]]'s top post during the year.&lt;ref name=Forbes2012 /&gt;   [[Ricardo Salinas Pliego]] was the greatest gainer in terms of dollars, adding $9.2 billion to his fortune and moving up to number 37 overall.  [[Facebook]]'s [[Mark Zuckerberg]] was also among the top gainers, adding $4 billion to his fortune.  [[Dustin Moskovitz]], also of Facebook, was the youngest self-made billionaire on the list at age 27.&lt;ref name=Telegraph2012 /&gt;  Making her debut on the list at age 41, [[Spanx]] founder [[Sara Blakely]] became the youngest self-made female billionaire ever.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Spanx creator Sara Blakely becomes youngest woman on Forbes Billionaires List|publisher=Fox News|date=March 8, 2012|url=http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2012/03/08/spanx-creator-sara-blakely-becomes-youngest-woman-on-forbes-billionaires-list/|accessdate=March 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Colombia's [[Alejandro Santo Domingo]] was the highest ranked newcomer, inheriting a $9.5 billion stake in [[Santo Domingo Group]] from his father.  [[Laurene Powell Jobs]], widow of [[Steve Jobs]], was just behind Domingo, inheriting a fortune of $9 billion.&lt;ref name=Telegraph2012 /&gt;

India's [[Lakshmi Mittal]] was the largest loser as his fortune dropped from $31.1 billion to $20.7 billion as the price of steel maker [[ArcelorMittal]] fell sharply.&lt;ref name=Telegraph2012 /&gt;  As a result, he failed to make the top 10 for the first time since 2004 and lost his title of richest Asian.  Hong Kong’s [[Li Ka-shing]] reclaimed that title, despite a slight drop in his own wealth.&lt;ref name=Forbes2012 /&gt;  ''[[Harry Potter]]'' author [[JK Rowling]] and former [[Research In Motion]] CEO [[Jim Balsillie]] were among whose who fell off the list.&lt;ref name=Telegraph2012&gt;{{cite news|title=Forbes rich list 2012: Carlos Slim tops rich list for third year|work=The Telegraph|date=March 8, 2012|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/9130301/Forbes-rich-list-2012-Carlos-Slim-tops-rich-list-for-third-year.html|accessdate=March 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A record total of 1,226 people made the 2012 list, representing 58 different countries.  Of those, 126 were newcomers to the list and 104 were women. The United States had the greatest number of billionaires with 425.  Russia had 96 people on the list, while China had 95.  Three new billionaires from Morocco represented their nation, which did not have any billionaire in 2011.&lt;ref name=Telegraph2012 /&gt;  Georgia and Peru also were newly represented.&lt;ref name=Forbes2012 /&gt;  Moscow was the home to the most billionaire with 78, followed by New York City with 58, and London with 39.&lt;ref name=Telegraph2012 /&gt;  Falling stock prices in Asia contributed to 117 former billionaires falling from the list worldwide.  Twelve others listed in 2011 died.&lt;ref name=Forbes2012 /&gt;

Combined net worth of the billionaire list rose to a record $4.6 trillion.  However, net gainers (460) barely outnumbered net losers (441, including 7 of the top 20).

=== 1979–1986: Early work ===
[[File:TomHanks1989.png|thumb|upright|left|Hanks at the [[61st Academy Awards|Academy Awards]] after party in March 1989]]
In 1979, Hanks moved to New York City, where he made his film debut in the low-budget [[slasher film]] ''[[He Knows You're Alone]]'' (1980)&lt;ref name=tca /&gt;&lt;ref name=HKY&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/movies/movie/21754/He-Knows-You-re-Alone/overview |title=He Knows You're Alone (1980) |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=July 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and landed a starring role in the television movie ''[[Mazes and Monsters]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Kushner |first=David |title=Dungeon Master: The Life and Legacy of Gary Gygax |work=Wired |url=http://archive.wired.com/gaming/virtualworlds/news/2008/03/ff_gygax?currentPage=all |accessdate=October 16, 2008 |date=March 10, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141031210259/http://archive.wired.com/gaming/virtualworlds/news/2008/03/ff_gygax?currentPage=all |archivedate=October 31, 2014 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early that year, he was cast in the lead, Callimaco, in the [[Riverside Shakespeare Company]]'s production of [[Niccolò Machiavelli]]'s ''[[The Mandrake]]'', directed by Daniel Southern. The following year, Hanks landed one of the lead roles, that of character Kip Wilson, on the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] television pilot of ''[[Bosom Buddies]]''.  He and [[Peter Scolari]] played a pair of young advertising men forced to dress as women so they could live in an inexpensive all-female hotel.&lt;ref name=tca /&gt; Hanks had previously partnered with Scolari on the 1970s game show ''[[Make Me Laugh]]''. After landing the role, Hanks moved to Los Angeles. ''Bosom Buddies'' ran for two seasons, and, although the ratings were never strong, television critics gave the program high marks. "The first day I saw him on the set," co-producer Ian Praiser told ''Rolling Stone'', "I thought, 'Too bad he won't be in television for long.' I knew he'd be a movie star in two years."  However, although Praiser knew it, he was not able to convince Hanks. "The television show had come out of nowhere," Hanks' best friend Tom Lizzio told ''Rolling Stone''.

''Bosom Buddies'' and a guest appearance on a 1982 episode of ''[[Happy Days]]'' ("A Case of Revenge," in which he played a disgruntled former classmate of [[Fonzie]]) prompted director [[Ron Howard]] to contact Hanks. Howard was working on the film ''[[Splash (film)|Splash]]'' (1984), a romantic comedy fantasy about a [[mermaid]] who falls in love with a human.&lt;ref name=splash&gt;{{cite book |title=Sensing the Past: Hollywood Stars and Historical Visions |last=Cullen |first=Jim |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |page=152 |date=February 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Tom and Colin Hanks |last=Isle |first=Mick |publisher=[[Rosen Publishing]] |pages=11, 39 |date=October 1, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; At first, Howard considered Hanks for the role of the main character's wisecracking brother, a role that eventually went to [[John Candy]]. Instead, Hanks landed the lead role in ''Splash'', which went on to become a surprise box office hit, grossing more than US$69&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/pictures/tom-hanks-from-big-to-brothers/ |title=From 'Big' To 'Brothers' |publisher=[[CBS News]] |accessdate=August 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also had a sizable hit with the sex comedy ''[[Bachelor Party (1984 film)|Bachelor Party]]'', also in 1984.&lt;ref name="Tom Hanks biography" /&gt; In 1983–84, Hanks made three guest appearances on ''[[Family Ties]]'' as Elyse Keaton's alcoholic brother, Ned Donnelly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Television listings |url=https://books.google.com/?id=Uek4AAAAIAAJ&amp;q=Tom+Hanks+Family+Ties&amp;dq=Tom+Hanks+Family+Ties |work=[[TV Guide (magazine)|TV Guide]] |date=November 27, 2003 |accessdate=January 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Riggs |first=Thomas |title=Contemporary Theatre, Film, and Television |publisher=[[Gale Research]] |year=2002 |page=117 |isbn=0-7876-5116-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With ''[[Nothing in Common]]'' (1986)&amp;nbsp;– a story of a young man alienated from his father (played by [[Jackie Gleason]])&amp;nbsp;– Hanks began to extend himself from comedic roles to dramatic roles. In an interview with ''Rolling Stone'' magazine, Hanks commented on his experience: "It changed my desires about working in movies. Part of it was the nature of the material, what we were trying to say. But besides that, it focused on people's relationships. The story was about a guy and his father, unlike, say, ''[[The Money Pit]]'', where the story is really about a guy and his house."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Encyclopedia of American Cinema |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zlSRS80XIfQC&amp;pg=PT1033&amp;lpg=PT1033&amp;dq=money+pit+Part+of+it+was+the+nature+of+the+material,+what+we+were+trying+to+say.+But+besides+that,+it+focused+on+people's+relationships.+The+story+was+about+a+guy+and+his+father,+unlike,+say,+The+Money+Pit,+where+the+story+is+really+about+a+guy+and+his+house&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=iIBD7s1Rcf&amp;sig=L_9M7MEagWxsKMDunuyXcGfqehM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=wY_7T-WRMoHr6wGZ6vGBBw&amp;ved=0CE0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=money%20pit%20Part%20of%20it%20was%20the%20nature%20of%20the%20material%2C%20what%20we%20were%20trying%20to%20say.%20But%20besides%20that%2C%20it%20focused%20on%20people's%20relationships.%20The%20story%20was%20about%20a%20guy%20and%20his%20father%2C%20unlike%2C%20say%2C%20The%20Money%20Pit%2C%20where%20the%20story%20is%20really%20about%20a%20guy%20and%20his%20house&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1987–2003: Established Star ===
After a few more flops and a moderate success with the comedy ''[[Dragnet (1987 film)|Dragnet]]'', Hanks' stature in the film industry rose.  The broad success of the fantasy comedy ''[[Big (film)|Big]]'' (1988) established Hanks as a major Hollywood talent, both as a box office draw and within the industry as an actor.&lt;ref name="Tom Hanks biography"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.biography.com/people/tom-hanks-9327661#big-break |title=Tom Hanks Biography |publisher=[[Biography.com]] ([[FYI (TV channel)|FYI]] / [[A&amp;E Networks]]) |accessdate=August 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tca /&gt;&lt;ref name=break&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/3983091.stm |title=Hanks' big splash in Hollywood |work=BBC News |date=November 5, 2004 |accessdate=July 31, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; For his performance in the film, Hanks earned his first nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actor.&lt;ref name=Bignom&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1989 |title=The 61st Academy Awards (1989) Nominees and Winners |publisher=[[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] |accessdate=July 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Big'' was followed later that year by ''[[Punchline (film)|Punchline]]'', in which he and [[Sally Field]] co-starred as struggling comedians.

Hanks then suffered a run of box-office underperformers: ''[[The 'Burbs]]'' (1989), ''[[Joe Versus the Volcano]]'' (1990), and ''[[The Bonfire of the Vanities (film)|The Bonfire of the Vanities]]'' (1990).&lt;ref name=tca /&gt; In the last, he portrayed a greedy [[Wall Street]] figure who gets enmeshed in a hit-and-run accident. 1989's ''[[Turner &amp; Hooch]]'' was Hanks' only financially successful film of the period.&lt;!--In a 1993 issue of ''[[Disney Adventures]]'', Hanks said, "I saw ''Turner &amp; Hooch'' the other day in the SAC store and couldn't help but be reminiscent. I cried like a baby." He did admit to making a couple of "bum tickers," however, and blamed his "...&amp;nbsp;deductive reasoning and decision making skills."{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}--&gt;

Hanks climbed back to the top again with his portrayal of a washed-up baseball legend turned manager in ''[[A League of Their Own]]'' (1992).&lt;ref name=tca /&gt; Hanks has stated that his acting in earlier roles was not great, but that he subsequently improved. In an interview with ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'', Hanks noted his ''"modern era of moviemaking&amp;nbsp;... because enough self-discovery has gone on&amp;nbsp;... My work has become less pretentiously fake and over the top"''. This "modern era" began in 1993 for Hanks, first with ''[[Sleepless in Seattle]]'' and then with ''[[Philadelphia (film)|Philadelphia]]''. The former was a blockbuster success about a widower who finds true love over the radio airwaves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/06/25/sleepless-in-seattle-anniversary_n_3496495.html |title='Sleepless in Seattle' Anniversary: Tom Hanks &amp; Meg Ryan Classic Turns 20 |work=[[HuffPost]] |date=June 25, 2013 |accessdate=July 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Schickel]] of ''TIME'' called his performance "charming," and most critics agreed that Hanks' portrayal ensured him a place among the premier romantic-comedy stars of his generation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=SCHICKEL |first=RICHARD |title=Modern Romance |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,978809,00.html |work=Time |date=July 5, 1993 |accessdate=July 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Philadelphia'', he played a [[homosexuality|gay]] lawyer with AIDS who sues his firm for discrimination.&lt;ref name=tca /&gt; Hanks lost 35 pounds and thinned his hair in order to appear sickly for the role. In a review for ''[[People (American magazine)|People]]'', Leah Rozen stated, "Above all, credit for ''Philadelphia''{{'}}s success belongs to Hanks, who makes sure that he plays a character, not a saint. He is flat-out terrific, giving a deeply felt, carefully nuanced performance that deserves an Oscar." Hanks won the 1993 [[Academy Award]] for Best Actor for his role in ''Philadelphia''.&lt;ref name=tca /&gt;&lt;ref name=Philwin&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oscars.org/awards/academyawards/oscarlegacy/1990-1999/66nominees.html |title=Nominees &amp; Winners for the 66th Academy Awards |publisher=[[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] |accessdate=July 10, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131113133558/http://www.oscars.org/awards/academyawards/oscarlegacy/1990-1999/66nominees.html |archivedate=November 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his acceptance speech, he revealed that his high school drama teacher Rawley Farnsworth and former classmate John Gilkerson, two people with whom he was close, were gay.&lt;ref&gt;[http://film.guardian.co.uk/oscars2000/story/0,,147619,00.html Winner Speeches].&lt;/ref&gt;

Hanks followed ''Philadelphia'' with the 1994 hit ''[[Forrest Gump]]'' which grossed a worldwide total of over $600&amp;nbsp;million at the box office.&lt;ref name=Forbox&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=forrestgump.htm |title=Forrest Gump |publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]] |accessdate=July 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hanks remarked: "When I read the script for ''Gump'', I saw it as one of those kind of grand, hopeful movies that the audience can go to and feel&amp;nbsp;... some hope for their lot and their position in life&amp;nbsp;... I got that from the movies a hundred million times when I was a kid. I still do."

After being selected in the [[Central Reserve Police Force]] (CRPF), he was posted in [[Jammu and Kashmir]]. While on duty as a guard at the house of a commandant, he attempted to rape the commandant's daughter. He then fled to Chitradurga district.&lt;ref name="ToI_gallows_2009"/&gt; In 1996, he managed to join the District Armed Reserve (DAR) Police, who were not aware of his background in CRPF.&lt;ref name="ToI_caught_2002"/&gt; Reddy had been charged in a road rage incident, but the local DAR inspector chose to ignore this "petty case".&lt;ref name="ToI_gallows_2009"/&gt; Reddy completed his police training in [[Madhya Pradesh]], and then returned to Karnataka.&lt;ref name="DNA_life_2009"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dnaindia.com/bangalore/report-life-and-times-of-a-psychopath-killer-1232240 |title=Life and times of a psychopath-killer |date=2009-02-19 |author=Srikanth Hunasavadi |newspaper=DNA }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Crimes ==

Reddy carefully selected his victims. He usually targeted [[housewife|housewives]] between 11 am and 3 pm, when there would be no men at home. He would gain entry into the victims' house on the pretext of asking for water or an address. He then threatened them with a knife, forced them to remove their clothes, tied them up, and raped them.&lt;ref name="DNA_life_2009"/&gt; He often choked his victims, and raped them while they were unconscious. After the rape, Reddy killed his victims, and removed their [[jewelry]] to make the crime appear like a robbery.&lt;ref name="ToI_gallows_2009"/&gt; He then escaped with the victim's undergarments.&lt;ref name="DNA_life_2009"/&gt; A [[transvestite]], Reddy was found wearing women's [[lingerie]] under his clothes, whenever the police arrested him.&lt;ref name="ToI_gallows_2009"/&gt;

In November 1996, Reddy attempted raping a high school girl, who was walking at KEB Colony in [[Chitradurga]]. The girl hit him with a stone, and managed to escape.&lt;ref name="ToI_gallows_2009"/&gt; On 6 December 1996, Reddy allegedly raped and murdered 16-year old Roopa, when she was returning to her house in the same locality. The next month, he was arrested and dismissed from service, when his first victim identified him at a [[Republic Day (India)|Republic Day]] police parade by chance.&lt;ref name="DNA_life_2009"/&gt;

Reddy, along with four others, was charged with Roopa's murder, and remanded to judicial custody (later, in 2004, he was acquitted in this case due to lack of sufficient evidence).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thehindu.com/2004/08/08/stories/2004080804100400.htm |title=All six accused in Rupa murder case acquitted |date=2004-08-08 |newspaper=The Hindu }}&lt;/ref&gt; A court asked him to be shifted to [[Bellary]] jail. In March 1997, while the Chitradurga police were handing him over to the Bellary prison authorities, Reddy escaped. He then killed an income tax officer's wife in [[Bangalore]], a girl in [[Ahmedabad]], two girls in [[Baroda]] and a widow in [[Kunigal]].&lt;ref name="ToI_caught_2002"/&gt;

Reddy would steal lingerie put up for drying in the backyards of houses. On 7 July 1997, he was arrested by [[Peenya]] police for stealing women's undergarments. When the police raided his room, they recovered a [[gunny bag]] full of lingerie. At the time of his arrest in Peenya, he told the police that his name was "Ramesh". Reddy escaped within 24 hours, while being transferred to the [[Arekere Mico Layout|MICO Layout]] police station for interrogation in another case. The police initially tried to hush up his escape, but Reddy's father filed a [[habeas corpus]] petition in the High Court. Two police personnel were then suspended, and a lookout notice was issued in the name of Ramesh.&lt;ref name="ToI_gallows_2009"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://epaper.timesofindia.com/Default/Scripting/ArticleWin.asp?From=Archive&amp;Source=Page&amp;Skin=pastissues2&amp;BaseHref=TOIBG%2F2009%2F02%2F19&amp;ViewMode=HTML&amp;PageLabel=1&amp;EntityId=Ar00101&amp;AppName=2 |title=It’s gallows for Umesh Reddy: Sessions Court Sentence Upheld |newspaper=The Times of India |date=2009-02-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 February 1998, Reddy raped and murdered 37-year-old widow Jayashree Maradi Subbaiah in [[Peenya]]. The police believe that he repeatedly [[necrophilia|raped the dead body]].&lt;ref name="ToI_gallows_2009"/&gt; When her 8-year-old son Suresh returned from school, he saw Reddy in his house. Reddy told the boy that an [[evil spirit]] had entered his mother's body, so he had tied her to the window [[grillwork|grill]]. He then fled saying that he was going to get a doctor.&lt;ref name="Telegraph_foul_2009"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1091108/jsp/7days/story_11713568.jsp |title=Murders most foul |author=Varun Verma |date=2009-11-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Reddy then attempted to rape another woman in Peenya. When the woman raised the alarm, he tried to escape by jumping from the first floor of the house. He [[sprained ankle|sprained his ankle]], and was caught by the neighbours, who handed him over to the police.&lt;ref name="ToI_gallows_2009"/&gt;

In 1999, Reddy once again escaped from the police custody near [[Hirekerur]]. Before he could commit any crime, he was arrested by inspector Nyame Gowda, in [[Chikkaballapur]].&lt;ref name="ToI_gallows_2009"/&gt;

On the night of 3–4 March 2002, Reddy escaped from police custody again, while being transferred from Bellary to Bangalore in a [[Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation|KSRTC]] bus. The District Armed Reserve (DAR) personnel of Bellary, who accompanied him, claimed that he was [[handcuffs|handcuffed]] at the time, but Reddy denied this when he was arrested two months later.&lt;ref name="TH_nabbed_2002"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thehindu.com/2002/05/18/stories/2002051802850300.htm |title=Notorious criminal Umesh Reddy nabbed |date=2002-05-18 |newspaper=The Hindu }}&lt;/ref&gt; He stated that he bought rum and chicken for the policemen, and earned their trust. When the bus stopped at a [[dhaba]] near Hiriyur bypass, he requested the policemen to remove his handcuffs on the pretext that he needed to answer the call of nature. Once free, he ran into the fields and escaped.&lt;ref name="ToI_caught_2002"/&gt;

Over the next two months, Reddy raped three girls in [[Davangere]], [[Hubli-Dharwad]] and [[Pune]]. He also stole three mobile phones and two credit cards. He worked as a [[waiting staff|waiter]] in a Pune hotel. He stole cash and clothes from there, and then fled to Dharwad.&lt;ref name="TH_nabbed_2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ToI_caught_2002"/&gt;

On 17 May 2002, Reddy arrived in Bangalore from [[Tumkur]], and left his luggage in the cloakroom at the [[Yesvantpur Junction railway station|Yeshwanthpur railway station]]. Around 8 am, he visited a salon in [[Yeshwanthpur]] area, to get a haircut and a clean shave. As he entered the salon, an [[auto-rickshaw]] driver Sathyavelu recognized him from a newspaper photograph and an earlier court appearance. The driver called his elder brother Rajendran from a telephone booth, and asked him to fetch the police. Meanwhile, he kept a vigil outside the salon. When Reddy exited the salon and started walking towards the railway station, Sathyavelu tipped off the police and followed him. Inspector Nagaraja Urs intercepted Reddy near Sharief Nagar and arrested him. At first Reddy claimed to be somebody else, but admitted that he was the serial killer, after being taken to the police station. The police rewarded the driver with {{INR}} 20,000. Reddy was found wearing a bra and panties. His baggage, seized from the cloakroom, contained several women's garments: 18 pairs of panties, 10 bras, 8 [[churidar]]s, 6 [[sari]]s, 4 [[blouse]]s and 2 [[nightie]]s.&lt;ref name="ToI_caught_2002"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/Rapist-killer-Umesh-Reddy-caught/articleshow/10197747.cms |title=Rapist-killer Umesh Reddy caught |date=2002-05-17 |newspaper=The Times of India }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Death sentence ==

Reddy was tried and convicted in 9 cases, including rape of Jayashree Subbaiah. He was acquitted in 11 cases due to lack of sufficient evidence.&lt;ref name="ToI_gallows_2009"/&gt; On 26 October 2006, Judge K Sukanya of the Bangalore city fast-track court gave him multiple [[sentence (law)|sentences]] including a death sentence, a 7-year sentence plus {{INR}} 25,000 fine and a 10-year sentence plus {{INR}} 25,000 fine. Reddy tried to win the judge's mercy by saying that he wanted to study and take care of his mother, but the judge did not relent. Since the death sentence was the heaviest sentence, the case was referred to the High Court as per procedure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/Bangalores-Jack-the-Ripper-gets-death/articleshow/192549.cms? |title=Bangalore's Jack the Ripper gets death |date=2006-10-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 October 2007, a division bench of the [[Karnataka High Court]] also convicted Reddy, but the judges differed on death sentence. Justice V G Sabhahit upheld the death penalty, but Justice Ravi B Naik advocated [[rigorous imprisonment]] for life with no scope for [[amnesty]]. A third judge, Justice [[S. R. Bannurmath]], was appointed to resolve the tie. On 18 February 2009, Bannurmath upheld the death sentence, and thus, the High Court confirmed death penalty for Umesh Reddy. On 1 February 2011, the Supreme Court also upheld the death sentence. Justices [[Altamas Kabir]] and A K Pathak argued that Reddy was incapable of [[rehabilitation (penology)|rehabilitation]], and that his rape and murder of Jayashree fell under "rarest of the rare" category, a requirement for [[capital punishment in India]].&lt;ref name="ToI_ripper_2011"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/Its-death-for-ripper-Umesh-Reddy/articleshow/7407738.cms |title=It's death for ripper Umesh Reddy |date=2011-02-02 |newspaper=The Times of India }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reddy immediately filed a [[pardon|mercy]] petition before the [[President of India]]. On 7 May 2012, the [[Government of Karnataka]] rejected Reddy's mercy plea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.deccanherald.com/content/247659/karnataka-govt-rejects-mercy-plea.html |title=Karnataka govt rejects mercy plea of serial rapist Umesh Reddy |date=2012-05-07 |newspaper=Deccan Herald }}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, the President of India also rejected his mercy petition on 12 May 2013. Reddy then filed a fresh petition, which is now pending before a Supreme Court [[Constitution Bench (India)|constitution bench]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/mercy-denied-the-execution-list-before-nda/ |title=Mercy denied, the execution list before NDA |date=2014-09-01 |author=Muzamil Jaleel }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In popular culture ==

The [[Kannada language]] movie ''Umesh'' (2013) is a fictionalized version of Umesh Reddy's life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/kannada/movies/news/Umesh-Reddy-inspires-filmmakers-in-Kannada/articleshow/20424926.cms |title=Umesh Reddy inspires filmmakers in Kannada |date=2013-06-04 |newspaper=The Times of India }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Khatarnak'' or ''Khatarnak Umesh Reddy'' (2013), another Kannada movie, was also based on Umesh Reddy's life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/kannada/movies/news/Kannada-film-on-Umesh-Reddy-gets-a-new-name/articleshow/23360516.cms |title=Kannada film on Umesh Reddy gets a new name |date=2013-10-01 |author=Kavya Christopher |newspaper=The Times of India }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.bangaloremirror.com/entertainment/reviews/Movie-review-Khatarnak/articleshow/26223657.cms |title=Movie review: Khatarnak |author=Shyam Prasad S |newspaper=Bangalore Mirror |date=2013-11-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;. His character was also portrayed by Adi Lokesh in [[Dandupalya 2]] &amp; [[Dandupalya 3]], where he is seen as one of the inmates of Dandupalya gang in Hindalga Prison

[[File:CRAWFORD, William H-Treasury (BEP engraved portrait).jpg|thumb|[[Bureau of Engraving and Printing]] portrait of Crawford as Secretary of the Treasury]]
'''William Harris Crawford''' (February 24, 1772 – September 15, 1834) was an [[United States|American]] [[politician]] and judge during the early 19th century. He served as [[United States Secretary of War]] and [[United States Secretary of the Treasury]] before running for president in the [[United States presidential election, 1824|1824 election]].

Born in Virginia, Crawford moved to [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] at a young age. After studying law, Crawford won election to the [[Georgia House of Representatives]] in 1803. He aligned with the [[Democratic-Republican Party]] and U.S. Senator [[James Jackson (Georgia politician)|James Jackson]]. In 1807, the Georgia legislature elected Crawford to the [[United States Senate]]. After the death of [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[George Clinton (vice president)|George Clinton]], Crawford's position as [[President pro tempore of the United States Senate|president pro tempore]] of the Senate made him [[United States presidential line of succession|first in the presidential line of succession]] from April 1812 to March 1813. In 1813, President [[James Madison]] appointed Crawford as the U.S. minister to [[France]], and Crawford held that post for the remainder of the [[War of 1812]]. After the war, Madison appointed him to the position of Secretary of War. In October 1816, Madison chose Crawford for the position of Secretary of the Treasury, and Crawford would remain in that office for the remainder of Madison's presidency and for the duration of [[James Monroe]]'s presidency.

Crawford suffered a severe stroke in 1823, but nonetheless sought to succeed Monroe in the 1824 election. The Democratic-Republican Party splintered into factions as several others also sought the presidency. No candidate won a majority of the electoral vote, so the [[United States House of Representatives]] chose the president in a contingent election. Under the terms of the Constitution, the House selected from the three candidates who received the most electoral votes, leaving [[Andrew Jackson]], [[John Quincy Adams]], and Crawford in the running. The House selected Adams, who asked Crawford to remain at Treasury. Refusing Adams' offer, Crawford accepted appointment to the [[Georgia Superior Courts|Georgia state superior court]]. He considered running in the 1832 presidential election, either for the presidency or the vice presidency, but ultimately chose not to run.

==Early life==
Crawford was born on February 24, 1772 in the portion of [[Amherst County, Virginia]] that later became [[Nelson County, Virginia|Nelson County]], the son of Joel Crawford and Fanny Harris, but at least one source has given his birthplace as [[Tusculum (Amherst, Virginia)|Tusculum]], a house whose site remains in Amherst County.&lt;ref name="sbc.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tusculum.sbc.edu/Household.shtml|title=History of a Household|publisher=|accessdate=23 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He moved with his family to [[Edgefield County, South Carolina]] in 1779 and to [[Columbia County, Georgia]] in 1783. Crawford was educated at private schools in Georgia and at [[Academy of Richmond County|Richmond Academy]] in [[Augusta, Georgia|Augusta]]. After his father's death, Crawford became the family's main financial provider, and he worked on the Crawford family farm and taught school. He later studied law, was admitted to the bar in 1799 and began to practice in [[Lexington, Georgia|Lexington]]. Also in 1799, Crawford was appointed by the state legislature to prepare a digest of Georgia's statutes.

==State politics==
He influenced Georgia politics for decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fair|first1=John D.|title=Governor David B. Mitchell and the 'Black Birds' Slave Smuggling Scandal|journal=Georgia Historical Quarterly|date=2015|volume=99|issue=4|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=aqh&amp;AN=114682494&amp;site=eds-live&amp;scope=site|accessdate=24 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1803, Crawford was elected to the [[Georgia House of Representatives]] as a member of the [[Democratic-Republican Party]], and he served until 1807. He allied himself with Senator [[James Jackson (Georgia politician)|James Jackson]]. Their enemies were the Clarkites, led by [[John Clark (Georgia governor)|John Clark]]. In 1802, he shot and killed Peter Lawrence Van Alen, a Clark ally, in a duel. Four years later, on December 16, 1806, Crawford faced Clark himself in a duel, and Crawford's left wrist was shattered by a shot from Clark, but he eventually recovered.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=2sNp1l1pNroC&amp;pg=PT33 Long, Kim. "''The Almanac of Political Corruption, Scandals &amp; Dirty Politics'', (2008).] {{ISBN|0307481344}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Congress==
In 1807, Crawford joined the [[10th United States Congress]] as the junior [[List of United States Senators from Georgia#Class II Senators|U.S. Senator from Georgia]] when the Georgia legislature elected him to replace [[George Jones (U.S. Senator)|George Jones]], who had held the office for a few months after the death of [[Abraham Baldwin]].

Crawford was elected President pro tempore of the Senate in March 1812, and then, following the April 20, 1812 death of Vice President George Clinton, Crawford, served as the permanent [[presiding officer of the United States Senate]] through March 4, 1813.

In 1811, Crawford declined to serve as [[US Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] in the Madison administration. In the Senate, he voted for several acts leading up to the [[War of 1812]], and he supported the entry into the war, but he was ready for peace:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Green|first1=Philip J.|title=William H. Crawford and the War of 1812|journal=The Georgia Historical Quarterly|date=1942|volume=26|issue=1|page=21|jstor=40576819}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Let it then be the wisdom of this nation to remain at peace, as long as peace is within its option."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gales|first1=Joseph|title=The Debates and Proceedings in the Congress of the United States, Eleventh Congress, First and Second Sessions [volume 1]|date=1853|publisher=Gales and Seaton|location=Washington, D.C.|page=543|url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc30347/|accessdate=24 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Minister to France==
In 1813, President [[James Madison]] appointed Crawford as the [[United States Ambassador to France|US minister to France]] during the waning years of the [[First French Empire]]; Crawford held that ministerial post until 1815, shortly after the end of the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kaplan|first1=Lawrence S.|title=The Paris Mission of William Harris Crawford, 1813–1815|journal=The Georgia Historical Quarterly|date=1976|volume=60|issue=1|page=9|jstor=40580240}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cabinet==
Upon Crawford's return, Madison appointed him as [[US Secretary of War|Secretary of War]]. After slightly more than a year of satisfactory service in that post and after disclaiming interest in the [[United States presidential election, 1816|1816 presidential race]] as the Democratic-Republican nomination, Crawford moved within the [[US Cabinet|Cabinet]] to become [[US Secretary of the Treasury|Secretary of the Treasury]]. He remained in that position through the rest of Madison's term and [[James Monroe]]'s entire administration, which ended in 1825.

==1824 election==
Crawford was again a leading candidate for the Democratic-Republican presidential nomination in the [[United States presidential election, 1824|1824 election]]. However, Crawford was put out of the running due to a paralyzing stroke he had suffered in 1823 as a result of a prescription given to him by his physician.&lt;ref&gt;They Also Ran, Irving Stone, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; The Democratic-Republican Party was now split, and one of the splinter groups nominated Crawford.

Despite Crawford's improved health (and the support of former Presidents Madison and [[Thomas Jefferson]]), he finished third in the electoral vote, behind [[Battle of New Orleans]] hero [[Andrew Jackson]] and Secretary of State [[John Quincy Adams]]. He thus was still in the nominal running when the Presidential election ended up in the House of Representatives because the [[Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twelfth Amendment]] allows the House to choose one of the top three candidates. His stroke ended whatever chance he had of winning.

==Later life==
Refusing Adams' request for him to remain at the Treasury, Crawford then returned to Georgia, where he was appointed as a [[Georgia Superior Courts|state superior court]] judge. Crawford remained an active judge until his death, a decade later.

Crawford was nominated for vice president by the Georgia legislature in 1828 but withdrew after support from other states was not forthcoming. Crawford also considered running for vice president in 1832 but decided against it, in favor of [[Martin Van Buren]]. Crawford also considered running for president again in 1832 but dropped the idea when Jackson decided to seek a second term.

Crawford is buried at the site of his home, about half a mile west of the current Crawford city limit.

==Societies==
During the 1820s, Crawford was a member of the prestigious society [[Columbian Institute for the Promotion of Arts and Sciences]], which had among its members former Presidents Andrew Jackson and John Quincy Adams.&lt;ref name="rathbun"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MY-5AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA118&amp;lpg=PA118&amp;dq=%22columbian+institute%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22columbian%20institute%22&amp;f=false |title=The Columbian institute for the promotion of arts and sciences: A Washington Society of 1816–1838. |first=Richard |last=Rathbun |accessdate=2010-06-20|work=|publisher=Bulletin of the United States National Museum, October 18, 1917}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Crawford also served as a Vice President in the [[American Colonization Society]] from its formation in 1817 to his death.

==Family==
Crawford was a descendent of John Crawford (1600–1676), who had come to [[Virginia]] in 1643 but participated and died in [[Bacon's Rebellion]].
