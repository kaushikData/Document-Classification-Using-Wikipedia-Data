'''1213 Algeria''', provisional designation {{mp|1931 XD}}, is a carbonaceous [[asteroid]] from the outer region of the [[asteroid belt]], approximately 32 kilometers in diameter. Discovered by [[Guy Reiss]] at [[Algiers Observatory]] in 1931, it was named after the North African country of [[Algeria]].

== Discovery ==

''Algeria'' was discovered by French astronomer [[Guy Reiss]] at the North African [[Algiers Observatory]] on 5 December 1931.&lt;ref name="MPC-Algeria" /&gt; Three nights later, the body was independently discovered by Belgian–American astronomer [[George Van Biesbroeck]] at the U.S. [[Yerkes Observatory]] in Wisconsin.&lt;ref name="springer" /&gt;

A first [[precovery]] was taken at Yerkes Observatory, extending the ''Algeria''{{'}}s [[observation arc]] by just 16 days prior to its official discovery observation.&lt;ref name="MPC-Algeria" /&gt;

== Orbit and classification ==

The dark asteroid orbits the Sun in the [[Kirkwood gap|outer]] main-belt at a distance of 2.7–3.5&amp;nbsp;[[Astronomical unit|AU]] once every 5 years and 7 months (2,035 days). Its orbit has an [[orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]] of 0.13 and an [[orbital inclination|inclination]] of 13[[Degree (angle)|°]] with respect to the [[ecliptic]].&lt;ref name="jpldata"/&gt;

== Physical characteristics ==

=== Lightcurve ===

A rotational [[lightcurve]] of ''Algeria'' was obtained from photometric observations made by French amateur astronomer [[Claudine Rinner]] in August 2002. Lightcurve analysis gave a [[rotation period]] of 16 hours with a brightness variation of 0.19 [[Magnitude (astronomy)|magnitude]] ({{small|[[LCDB quality code|U=2]]}}).&lt;ref name="geneva-obs" /&gt;

=== Diameter and albedo ===

According to the space-based surveys carried out by the Infrared Astronomical Satellite [[IRAS]], the Japanese [[Akari (satellite)|Akari]] satellite, and NASA's [[Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer]] with its subsequent [[NEOWISE]] mission, ''Algeria'' measures between 29.2 and 34.5 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an [[astronomical albedo|albedo]] in the range of 0.057 to 0.093.&lt;ref name="Masiero-2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WISE" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ali-Lagoa-2013" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Masiero-2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SIMPS" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AKARI" /&gt;

The ''Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link'' derives an albedo of 0.059 and a diameter of 33.1 kilometers with an [[absolute magnitude]] of 11.1, and characterizes it as a [[C-type asteroid]].&lt;ref name="lcdb" /&gt;

== Naming ==

This [[minor planet]] was named in honour of the North African country [[Algeria]], location of the discovering observatory and a French colony at the time.&lt;ref name="springer" /&gt; Naming citation was published before 1977 ({{small|[[Minor Planet Circulars|M.P.C.]] H 112}}).&lt;ref name="MPC-Circulars-Archive" /&gt;

The '''A4074''' is a British [[A roads in Great Britain|A road]] from the [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]] suburb of [[Caversham, Berkshire|Caversham]] to the Heyford Hill roundabout on the [[Oxford Ring Road]].&lt;ref name=sabre&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.sabre-roads.org.uk/wiki/index.php?title=A4074 | title = A4074 | work = sabre-roads.org.uk | accessdate = 23 October 2015 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151023103016/http://www.sabre-roads.org.uk/wiki/index.php?title=A4074 | archivedate = 23 October 2015 | deadurl = no}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The road starts from a junction with the [[A4155 road|A4155]] close to the northern side of [[Caversham Bridge]] (over the [[River Thames]]) before climbing through the up-market residential area of [[Caversham Heights]]. Crossing the Reading Borough boundary, the road proceeds through the small community of [[Chazey Heath]], where it enters thick woodland for several miles before emerging near the village of [[Woodcote]]. From here it crosses the more exposed ground of the [[Chiltern Hills]] before bypassing both [[Wallingford, Oxfordshire|Wallingford]] and [[Crowmarsh Gifford]] on the Wallingford bypass.  It then passes by [[Benson, Oxfordshire|Benson]], passes through [[Shillingford]], bypasses [[Dorchester, Oxfordshire|Dorchester]] and passes through [[Nuneham Courtenay]]. The road becomes dual-carriageway as it passes [[Sandford-on-Thames]] and remains so to its terminus on the Oxford Ring Road at the Heyford Hill roundabout.&lt;ref name=sabre/&gt;

The road was designated in the 1980s {{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}, when the B479 between Caversham and Crowmarsh Gifford was renumbered.  In 1990 {{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} the [[A423 road|A423]] from Crowmarsh to Heyford Hill was renumbered the A4074, and the road became the primary route between Reading and [[Oxford]] in place of the [[A329 road|A329]] along the [[River Thames]].  The short stretch of the Oxford Ring Road between Heyford Hill and the [[Hinksey Hill]] interchange was not renumbered A4074, and remains an isolated fragment of the A423.

The poor safety record of a particular stretch of this road, roughly between Chazey Heath and Woodcote, is highlighted in its local nickname, ''The 13 Bends of Death''. Its accident rate of 53 per 100 million vehicle kilometres is nearly 70% higher than average for roads of its type.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/driving/features/article716874.ece Times Online. ''Britain's deadliest road: the 13 bends of death.'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Thames Travel]] company operates a half-hourly bus service numbered between Reading and Oxford along the A4074, albeit passing through the centre of Wallingford rather than using the by-pass. Alternate buses are numbered X39 and X40, with the X40 also diverting from the main road to serve Woodcote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://assets.goaheadbus.com/media/cms_page_media/469/X39&amp;X40_Leaflet_Sept2015_WEB.pdf |title=Route X39/40 |publisher=Thames Travel |accessdate=23 October 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151023102905/http://assets.goaheadbus.com/media/cms_page_media/469/X39%26X40_Leaflet_Sept2015_WEB.pdf |archivedate=23 October 2015 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Albury-new-south-wales-aerial.jpg|thumb|Aerial view of the Albury region]]
[[File:Wodonga-victoria-aerial.jpg|thumb|Aerial view of Wodonga, to the left of the stream of water]]
'''Albury–Wodonga''' is the broad settlement incorporating the twin [[List of cities in Australia|Australian cities]] of [[Albury]] and [[Wodonga]], which are separated geographically by the [[Murray River]] and politically by a state border: Albury on the north of the river is part of [[New South Wales]] while Wodonga on the south bank is in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]].

Although in many senses the centre operates as one community, it has parallel municipal governments and state government services. However, the fact that Melbourne is significantly closer than Sydney and the fact that Victorian radio and television broadcasts in the region, resulting (among other things) in the predominance of [[Australian rules football]] in the local media outlets, gives Albury close cultural and social links to Victoria, despite its location in southern New South Wales.

Albury–Wodonga was selected as the primary focus of the federal [[Gough Whitlam|Whitlam]] government's scheme to arrest the uncontrolled growth of Australia's large coastal cities ([[Sydney]] and [[Melbourne]] in particular) by encouraging decentralisation. Grand plans were made to turn Albury–Wodonga into a major inland city. Some industries were enticed to move there, and a certain amount of population movement resulted.  However, due to the subsequent Fraser Government's repudiation of Labor's decentralisation policies, the plan to populate inland areas and cities other than the State capitals was abandoned. No other Commonwealth Government since, either [[Liberal Party of Australia|conservative]] or [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]], has made any attempt at repopulating inland areas. Thus the current Albury–Wodonga population is far below the 300,000 projected by Gough Whitlam in the 1970s.&lt;ref name="Wright2010"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/population-its-time-again-20101022-16xvm.html|title=Population: it's time (again)|last=Wright|first=Tony|date=23 October 2010|work=The Age|publisher=Fairfax Publications|accessdate=2 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The population increased by 1.1% per year on average from  81,540 in 2008 to 86,274 in 2013.&lt;ref name=factsheet&gt;{{cite web | url= https://infrastructure.gov.au/infrastructure/pab/soac/files/factsheets_2014/Albury-Wodonga_Factsheet_2014.pdf | title=Albury Wodonga Factsheet | work = State of Australian Cities 2014-15 | author= Department of Infrastructure and Regional Development | publisher= Commonwealth of Australia | accessdate= 2 October 2016 | date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The industrial employment sector has meant that Albury–Wodonga, unusually for an Australian inland city, is not dependent on agriculture. According to the most recently available figures from the [[Australian Bureau of Statistics]], the average income of the Albury area is $36K per year, below the $42K average for the state of New South Wales.

The '''Arab Forum for Environment and Development''' ('''AFED''') ({{lang-ar|المنتدى العربي للبيئة والتنمية}}) is a not-for-profit regional non-governmental organization, membership-based organization headquartered in [[Beirut]], [[Lebanon]], with the status of international organization; grouping experts together with the civil society, business community and media, to promote prudent [[Environmental policy|environmental policies]] and programmes across the [[Arab world|Arab region]]. 

While it maintains its character as a non-governmental organization, AFED admits, in the capacity of observers, national, regional and international bodies working in the fields of [[Environment (biophysical)|environment]] and [[sustainable development]]. It has been endorsed by the [[League of Arab States]] (LAS) and the [[United Nations Environment Programme]] (UNEP).

AFED was officially proclaimed in [[Beirut]] on 17 June 2006, at the conclusion of a regional conference on Public Opinion and the Environment, organized by Al-Bia Wal-Tanmia ([[Environment and Development (magazine)|Environment &amp; Development magazine]]). The initiative, which started in 2001 by Al-Bia Wal-Tanmia publisher [[Najib Saab]] as an informal gathering of the magazine’s region-wide readers, was established as a regional organization on the occasion of its tenth anniversary. AFED has subsequently earned the status of international non-governmental organization, with the associated amenities for its secretariat based in [[Beirut]]. Al-Bia Wal-Tanmia magazine became an organ of AFED as of January 2013, after [[Najib Saab|Saab]] turned it over to the [[Pan-Arabism|pan-Arab]] organization.

== Mission ==
Since 2007, AFED has been a public forum for influential eco-advocates. During six years, it has become a major dynamic player in the environmental arena. AFED works towards bringing together all parties concerned with environment and development in the [[Arab world]] to discuss regional and national issues related to the [[Environment (biophysical)|environment]], in view of local and global changes, emphasizing the pivotal role of [[civil society]] and the [[private sector]]. It groups regional [[environmental organization]]s and experts with leading academic institutions, media and the business community, on common debate grounds to further the cause of environment and sustainable development.

The [[Forum (Roman)|Forum]], which cooperates with regional and international institutions, aims at spreading [[Environmentalism|environmental awareness]] through promoting sensible information and education programmes, as well as supporting civil society organizations active in the environmental sector.

AFED aims at encouraging Arab societies to protect the environment and use [[natural resource]]s in a sensible manner resulting in sustainable development. An independent periodic report on the State of Arab Environment (SAE) is yearly produced by AFED, to be presented to the General Assembly of the Forum. The high-level annual forum is designed to attract participants from the private and public sectors, academia, experts, media and civil society.

== Goals ==
* '''Bringing together''' those concerned about environment and development in the [[Arab countries]], to discuss problems in the light of changing regional and global conditions, and help addressing challenges, through appropriate policies.
* '''Motivating''' Arab societies to protect the environment, rationally utilize natural resources, and realize sustainable development goals, through positive interaction among policy makers, businessmen, academia, civil society, media, and other stakeholders.
* '''Propagating''' environmental awareness, by supporting [[environmental education]] and information and providing capacity building for civil society organizations.

== Course of action ==
AFED works to achieve its goals through the following course:

* Issuing a periodical report on the state of the environment and natural resources in the [[Arab world]], with an emphasis on evaluating the progress towards the realization of [[sustainable development]] targets, as well as examining Arab contribution to global environmental endeavors.
* Convening regularly to discuss regional reports on environmental matters and to investigate their impact on the process of sustainable development in the Arab world, with subsidiary meetings to discuss issues of special concern or specific sub-regional problems.
* Working with the business community in the Arab world to develop a [[Corporate Environmental Responsibility Programme]], adopt sustainable practices and move towards [[cleaner production]] technologies.
* Encouraging scientific research on current and emerging environmental issues in the Arab world.
* Cooperating with the media and the advertising sectors to promote [[Environmentalism|environmental awareness]] through various tools.
* Working with educational institutions, universities, and research centres towards the development of environmental education programmes at all levels, both for promoting constructive environmental behavior and attitudes, and building up capacities in the domains of environmental sciences and management.
* Supporting networking of [[Non-governmental organization|NGO]]’s active in the domain of environment and development and coordinating joint programmes among them.

==Governance==
The Arab Forum for Environment and Development is governed by a [[Board of directors|Board of Trustees]], representing environmental experts alongside business, media, and civil society leaders. The Board of Trustees elects an [[Committee#Executive committee|Executive Committee]] that includes a [[Chairman]], [[Chairman#Vice chairman and deputy chairman|Vice Chairman]], [[Secretary-General|Secretary General]], [[Treasurer]] and members. It also appoints [[honorary members]] and an [[external auditor]]. It meets annually to decide on AFED policies, programs, and [[budget]]. The Executive Committee oversees the overall management of AFED, including programs and finance, and meets at least twice a year. Responsibility for the daily management of AFED lies with the Secretary General, assisted by a core secretariat.

==Funding==
AFED funds come from:

* Membership fees
* Contributions to AFED [[Financial endowment|Endowment]]
* [[Sponsor (commercial)|Sponsorship]] by corporate partners and organizations
* Income from activities and services

As a not-for-profit organization, any surplus [[Working capital|capital]] is invested in new initiatives or existing programs.

==Membership==
Prospective members and observers must submit their applications to AFED [[Committee#Executive committee|Executive Committee]], which will consider each case according to the set criteria. Membership continues as long as a member meets the criteria and pays the annual dues. AFED membership is open to all those committed to the goals of [[sustainable development]] in Arab countries. The main requirement is acceptance and adoption of AFED [[mission statement]], and commitment to help achieve AFED goals. AFED provides a platform to address and reach a wider audience, in public and private sectors, while allowing networking, exchange of expertise, and exposure to similar initiatives around the world. Working together in such a unique partnership allows members to advance their knowledge of emerging trends and business strategies, while serving a good social and environmental cause. In turn, these efforts will contribute to empowering Arab countries and societies to better tackle the challenges of an increasingly complex world, and embrace the transition to a green economy, that will lead to recession-proof growth, economic vitality, and welfare of Arab societies.

''AFED membership is institutional''
In five years, 110 institutional members joined AFED, including: 40 corporate members, 24 NGOs including one political Green party, 12 universities and research centers, 24 media organizations, and 10 government agencies as observers.

AFED’s expert-written, policy oriented annual reports have become the main reference on the state of Arab environment. Findings and recommendations have been endorsed by national and regional bodies. Alongside the original Arabic and English editions, the reports were translated into other languages, including Japanese and Spanish. AFED’s reports can be downloaded from [https://web.archive.org/web/20150118172851/http://www.afedonline.org/en/innerListing.aspx?menuID=12 AFED website].

==Annual conventions==
The most recent AFED convention, held in [[Sharjah (city)|Sharjah]], [[UAE]], in October 2013, brought together over 600 delegates from the public and private sectors, scientists, civil society and media, who engaged in an open debate on [[Sustainable Energy]] in the Arab region. The 2012 convention, in [[Beirut]], tackled [[Survival Options]] and [[Ecological footprint|Ecological Footprint]]. The 2011 convention discussed [[Green economy|Green Economy]], while the 2010 convention debated AFED’s report Water: Sustainable Management of a Scarce Resource. The 2009 convention discussed the impact of [[climate change]] on Arab countries. The first 2008 convention in [[Bahrain]] tackled future [[environmental challenges]]. All AFED conventions issue recommendations for action, which are discussed with governments and other [[Project stakeholder|stakeholders]], and in many cases have contributed to changes in national policies.

==AFED activities==

===AFED Mag===

AFED and ‘’Al-Bia Wal-Tanmia’’ ([[Environment and Development (magazine)|Environment and Development magazine]]) launched, in March 2013, the first comprehensive online environmental portal in Arabic, making over 35,000 pages of references freely available to readers and researchers. The domain includes a full archive of the magazine contents during the past 18 years. The website is updated daily with news, information and commentaries. The domain’s name [http://www.afedmag.com www.afedmag.com] ('''AFED magazine''') reflects a new epoch of the magazine, which became an organ of AFED as of January 2013, after its publisher [[Najib Saab]] turned it over to the [[Pan-Arabism|pan-Arab]] organization.

===AFED documentaries===

AFED produced six documentaries.

* The latest, “Powering Arab Future”, summarized AFED report on [[Sustainable Energy]], and was shown during [[ESCWA]] [[Renewable Energy]] Conference in [[Morocco]], 2013.
* “That They May Have Life” , discussed [[Ecological Footprint]] and the right of future generations to natural resources. 
* “Green Change” was launched at AFED’s 2011 annual convention.
* A documentary on water scarcity in the Arab world, entitled “The Last Drop”, was screened in its third annual conference in November 2010, and broadcast in [[2010 United Nations Climate Change Conference|Cancun Summit]] and on several Arab televisions networks.
* Its 2009 “Wet and Dry” documentary on climate change was broadcast more than 450 times on national and regional television networks. 
* The earlier “Testimony of an Old Man” in 2008 was broadcast 600 times, and over 6000 DVDs were distributed to schools, civil society organizations, business executives, and governments.

AFED continues to support the capacity building initiatives of its member NGOs, as well as its [[Consciousness raising|awareness campaigns]], school competitions, and training of journalists.

===Environmental education===

AFED has developed a [http://www.afed-ecoschool.org comprehensive environmental education program], supported by a wide-ranging handbook. It provides all material needed to initiate environment activities at schools and incorporate environment in the curricula. Each of the 2 topics is supported by graphics, posters, documentaries, songs and plays, all available online. AFED program includes developing [[Curriculum|curricula]] at the national levels and teacher training workshops.

===Arab Green Economy Initiative===

In May 2009, AFED launched the Arab Green Economy Initiative (AGEI), designed to facilitate the transition of governments and businesses to more environment-friendly practices. The AGEI covers: Public Policy Recommendations, Economics of [[Ecosystem|Eco-system]] Investing, [[Corporate Environmental Responsibility]] (CER), New Business Workshops, Sustainability Reporting, and Web-based [[Consumer Education]]. AFED carried out workshops for stakeholders in seven Arab countries to kick-start the AGEI program and select priorities. The 2011 AFED report Green Economy: Sustainable Transition in a Changing Arab World was one component of the initiative. Other components are 2 handbooks which AFED produced and are in use across the region, on:

* [[Water efficiency|Water Efficiency]], which is a practical guide, providing tips on achieving better sensible use of water in buildings.
* [[Energy conservation|Energy Efficiency]], which is designed to help better environmental housekeeping in office buildings.

In January 2012, the [[United Arab Emirates|UAE]] announced its national initiative «Green Economy for Sustainable Development”.

===Corporate Environmental Responsibility===

AFED launched its Corporate Environmental Responsibility (CER) initiative in [[Abu Dhabi]], on 29 November 2007, at the conclusion of the [[Arab CER Summit]], organized by AFED and [[Environment Agency Abu Dhabi]] (EAD). Over 120 CEOs, representing major business sectors from across the [[Arab world]], have committed to advance the principles of [[Ecosophy|environmental responsibility]] and [[cleaner production]], and set a target to reduce energy and water consumption by 20% in their operations by 2012. The CER program works with business enterprises to institutionalize environmental thinking and action in corporate decision making. It also aims at developing a comprehensible roadmap for navigating a transition to environmental responsibility, by integrating environmental goals more effectively into core business operations and strategy.

===Cooperation with organizations===

AFED has contributed to over 200 regional and international meetings, reports and programs. Its reports, recommendations and initiatives have been discussed and considered at high-level regional and international meetings, including [[UNEP]], the [[Council of Arab Ministers Responsible for Environment]] (CAMRE), the [[World Bank]], [[United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia|ESCWA]] and [[International Labour Organization|ILO]]. AFED gained [[observer status]] with [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change|UNFCCC]], [[United Nations Environment Programme|UNEP]] and [[Arab League|LAS]].

==Quotations==

* '''Dr. [[Andrew Steer]]'''
President, [[World Resources Institute]] (WRI)

“I have seen many environmental organizations in my time and I think the combination that AFED brings is absolutely best practice. You bring a sharp pencil of analysis, together with the right mix of people: private sector, government, academic, civil society, financiers; because we need all hands on deck if we are going to solve the problem. This part of the world has given to all of us two extraordinary leaders in environment. One is Mustafa Kamal Tolba who was the executive director of UNEP and who has been a precursor in these events; and the other one is, Mohamed El-Ashry, who led GEF, the Global Environmental Facility, and who has been a leader in every thought process dealing with the transition to low carbon. It is not just a coincidence that both are AFED veterans.”

* '''[[Kerstin Fritzsche]]'''
[[Center for Near and Middle Eastern Studies]] (CNMS), The Philipp [[University of Marburg]], Germany

“AFED reports have been a valuable source of information and inspiration to my students when learning about the Arab region”

* '''[[José María Figueres]]'''
Former President of [[Costa Rica]] and Chairman of the [[Carbon War Room]]

“The report which has been put out by AFED constitutes a very good footprint for action. And action it is what we are convened to undertake in the world of today."

'''Environmental Defense Fund''' or '''EDF''' (formerly known as '''Environmental Defense''') is a United States-based [[nonprofit]] [[environmental organization|environmental advocacy group]]. The group is known for its work on issues including [[global warming]], [[ecosystem restoration]], oceans, and human health, and advocates using sound [[science]], [[economics]] and [[law]] to find environmental solutions that work. It is nonpartisan, and its work often advocates [[Market (economics)|market]]-based solutions to environmental problems.

The group's headquarters are in [[New York City]], with offices across the US, with scientists and policy specialists working worldwide. Regional offices more focused on local issues and policies include [[Austin, Texas]]; [[Boston]]; [[Boulder, Colorado]]; [[Los Angeles]]; [[Raleigh, North Carolina]]; [[Sacramento, California]]; [[San Francisco]]; [[Washington, D.C.]]

Their research uncovered a link between the spraying of [[DDT]] to kill [[mosquito]]s and thinning egg shells of large birds. Their research was most likely based on the book ''[[Silent Spring]]'' by [[Rachel Carson]] about the dangers of DDT and the effects that it had on birds, published in 1962.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}} Carson, who died in 1964, is noted as the scientist who inspired the environmental movement.

In looking back at passage of the Safe Drinking Water Act of 1974, top EPA officials responsible for implementing the law recall that EDF published a statistical study that supported a link between organic contaminants and cancer rates in the City of New Orleans, a study that received a tremendous amount of media attention and certainly contributed to the enactment of the law.&lt;ref&gt;EPA Alumni Association: Senior EPA officials discuss early implementation of the Safe Drinking Water Act of 1974, [http://www.epaalumni.org/history/video/interview.cfm?id=13 Video], [http://www.epaalumni.org/userdata/pdf/6014106B36AE81EB.pdf#page=3 Transcript] (see p4).&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 11, 2018, the group announced plans for MethaneSAT, a satellite to help identify global methane emissions, concentrating on the 50 major oil and gas regions responsible for 80% of methane production.

==Criticism==
EDF has drawn criticism for its ties to large corporations including [[McDonald's]], [[FedEx]], [[Walmart]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CorpWatch: Greenwashing Walmart|url=http://www.corpwatch.org/article.php?id=15707}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Texas energy company [[TXU Energy|TXU]], with which the organization has negotiated to reduce emissions and develop more environmentally friendly business practices. EDF's philosophy is that it is willing to talk with big business and try new approaches in order to get environmental results.&lt;ref&gt;

===Fisheries conservation===
A 2009 op-ed piece by the Pacific Coast Federation of Fisherman's Association in the trade journal ''Fishermen's News'' argues that EDF's approach to fisheries policy in the Pacific Northwest is likely to damage smaller, local operators who have an interest in protecting [[fishery|fisheries]] and limiting [[by-catch]]. Many fisherman fear that the approach gives a competitive advantage to larger, non-local operations, jeopardizing independent operators, including boats, fisheries, and ports.&lt;ref&gt;
AND THE BIG FOOL SAID "MARCH ON"
Groundfish Ratz and the Fate of Coastal Fishing Communities {{cite web |url=http://www.pcffa.org/fn-aug09.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-11-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100713142344/http://www.pcffa.org/fn-aug09.htm |archivedate=2010-07-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

EDF argues that the way we manage our fisheries needs to change if we want to protect fishermen, fish, and coastal communities. In a report suggesting economic waste in some of the world's commercial fisheries,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fisheries waste costs billions|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/7660011.stm|accessdate=21 June 2011|newspaper=BBC News|date=8 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; EDF advocates an approach:&lt;ref name="costello"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Costello|first=Christopher|author2=Steven D. Gaines |author3=John Lynham |title=Can Catch Shares Prevent Fisheries Collapse?|journal=Science|date=19 September 2008|volume=321|issue=5896|pages=1678–1681|doi=10.1126/science.1159478|pmid=18801999}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[catch share]]s, which sets a scientifically based limit on the total amount of fish that can be caught; that amount is then divided among individuals or groups, who can sell their shares or lease them to fishermen. EDF suggests that concern about consolidation or corporate ownership of fisheries is unwarranted.&lt;ref name="sustaining"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sustaining America's Fisheries and Fishing Communities: An Evaluation of Incentive-Based Management|url=http://www.edf.org/documents/6119_sustainingfisheries.pdf|publisher=Environmental Defense Fund}}&lt;/ref&gt;

EDF has been accused of funding and disseminating studies &lt;ref name="cironline.org"&gt;{{cite web|title=System turns US fishing rights into commodity, squeezes small fishermen|url=http://cironline.org/reports/system-turns-us-fishing-rights-commodity-squeezes-small-fishermen-4250|access-date=2013-03-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130315212121/http://cironline.org/reports/system-turns-us-fishing-rights-commodity-squeezes-small-fishermen-4250|archive-date=2013-03-15|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; that utilize questionable science and economics&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bromley |first=Daniel W.|authorlink=Daniel Bromley |title=Abdicating Responsibility: The Deceits of Fisheries Policy |journal=Fisheries |year=2009 |volume=34 |issue=6 |pages=280–290 |doi=10.1577/1548-8446-34.6.280 |url=http://www.fishsec.org/downloads/1237996663_49692.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150317233112/http://www.fishsec.org/downloads/1237996663_49692.pdf |archivedate=2015-03-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; in their promotion of catch share fishery management. Also, they have employed substantial political lobbying &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/clientsum.php?|id=D000033473|year=2012|title=Environmental Defense Fund}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=U.S. Senate KOs bid to stop catch shares|url=http://www.gloucestertimes.com/fishing/x1265048775/U-S-Senate-KOs-bid-to-stop-catch-shares|publisher=Gloucester Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; to promote fisheries policies that tend to force out smaller fishing businesses in favor of consolidated, corporate owned fleets,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brewer|first=J. F.|title=J. F. Brewer, Paper Fish and Policy Conflict: Catch Shares and Ecosystem-Based|journal=Ecology and Society|year=2011|volume=16|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; while denying any adverse effects these programs have on fishing families and communities.&lt;ref name="Grimm 2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Grimm|first=Dietmar|title=Assessing catch shares' effects evidence from Federal United States|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

EDF has held meetings with private investors &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Milken Institute Global Conference|url=http://www.opc.ca.gov/webmaster/ftp/pdf/public_comment/20110830_Helliwell_email_2_attachment_1_of_2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; where their West Coast vice president, David Festa, promoted the purchase of fishing rights as an investment that can yield 400% profits, and "options value" despite its claims&lt;ref name="Grimm 2011"/&gt; that these rights are designed to provide financial incentives for the fishermen themselves. Multiple non-profit organizations have expressed repeated frustrations &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A cautionary Tale|url=http://ecotrust.ca/fisheries/study-cautions}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Distorting Catch Share Criticism |url=http://www.gloucestertimes.com/fishing/x46885704/Distorting-catch-share-criticism |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130411010815/http://www.gloucestertimes.com/fishing/x46885704/Distorting-catch-share-criticism |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-04-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foodandwaterwatch.org/blogs/catch-shares-ideology-is-a-one-way-street-in-the-wrong-direction/ |title=Catch Shares Ideology is a One-Way Street in the Wrong Direction |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130531182601/http://foodandwaterwatch.org/blogs/catch-shares-ideology-is-a-one-way-street-in-the-wrong-direction/ |archivedate=2013-05-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; with EDF and its promotion of these management policies. Recent studies &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Essington|first=Timothy|title=Catch shares, fisheries, and ecological stewardship: a comparative analysis of resource responses to a rights-based policy instrument|journal=Seattle School of Aquatic Fisheries Science|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Essington|first=T.

The Environmental Defense Fund supports the [[Rigs-to-Reefs]] program in the [[Gulf of Mexico]], in which former offshore oil production platforms are converted to permanent artificial reefs. The EDF sees the program as a way to preserve the existing reef habitat of the oil platforms.&lt;ref&gt;Jack Sterne, [http://blogs.edf.org/edfish/2012/04/24/edf-stands-with-fishermen-in-calling-for-suspension-of-rig-removal-policy/ "EDF stands with fishermen in calling for suspension of rig removal policy"], ''EDF Oceans'', 24 Apr. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Natural gas===
EDF sees natural gas as a way to quickly replace coal, with the idea that gas in time will be replaced by renewable energy.&lt;ref&gt;EDF, [http://www.edf.org/climate/why-natural-gas-important Why natural gas is important], accessed 4 Oct. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The organization presses for stricter environmental controls on gas drilling and [[hydraulic fracturing]], without banning them.&lt;ref&gt;EDF, [http://www.edf.org/energy/natural-gas-policy Natural gas policy], accessed 4 Oct. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2013, after negotiations with the oil industry, EDF representatives joined spokesmen for [[Anadarko Petroleum Corporation]], [[Noble Energy]], and [[Encana]], to endorse Colorado governor [[John Hickenlooper]]'s proposed tighter regulation of emissions of volatile organic compounds by oil and gas production.&lt;ref&gt;Cathy Proctor, [http://www.bizjournals.com/denver/blog/earth_to_power/2013/11/colorado-unveils-new.html "Colorado unveils proposed oil and gas air quality rules" (Video)], ''Denver Business Journal'', 18 Nov. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; EDF has funded studies jointly with the petroleum industry on the environmental effects of natural gas production. The policy has been criticized by some environmentalists.&lt;ref&gt;Larry Bernstein, [https://articles.washingtonpost.com/2013-05-22/national/39441658_1_oil-companies-energy-companies-kennedy-jr Environmental Defense Fund scolded by other green organizations on 'fracking'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131109052409/http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2013-05-22/national/39441658_1_oil-companies-energy-companies-kennedy-jr |date=2013-11-09 }}, Washington Post, 22 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; EDF counsel and blogger Mark Brownstein answered:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Demand for natural gas is not going away, and neither is hydraulic fracturing. We must be clear-eyed about this, and fight to protect public health and the environment from unacceptable impacts. We must also work hard to put policies in place that ensure that natural gas serves as an enabler of renewable power generation, not an impediment to it. We fear that those who oppose all natural gas production everywhere are, in effect, making it harder for the U.S. economy to wean itself from dirty coal.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Brownstein, [http://blogs.edf.org/energyexchange/2012/09/10/why-edf-is-working-on-natural-gas/ Why EDF is working on natural gas], 10 Sept. 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Ernest Frederick '''"'''Fred'''"''' Roots''' {{post-nominals|country=CAN|OC|FRSC}} (5 July 1923 – 18 October 2016)&lt;ref name=GMdeath&gt;{{cite news|title= Ernest Frederick Roots, July 5, 1923 - October 18, 2016 |url= http://v1.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/Deaths.20161025.93381030/BDAStory/BDA/deaths |newspaper= [[The Globe and Mail]] |date= 25 October 2016 |access-date= 4 November 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was a Canadian geologist, polar explorer, educator and public servant. After graduating with undergraduate and master's degrees in geology from the [[University of British Columbia]] and a doctorate from [[Princeton University]], Roots joined the [[Scott Polar Research Institute]] and was appointed Chief Geologist for the 1949 to 1952 [[Norwegian–British–Swedish Antarctic Expedition]]. During the expedition, in addition to ground-breaking geological and glaciological research studies, he made a 189-day, unsupported [[dog sled]] journey across the continent; a record that still stood at the time of his death over six decades later. On his return to Canada he joined the [[Geological Survey of Canada]] with whom he served as a field geologist until 1958, when he left to help found the [[Polar Continental Shelf Program]]. After 14 years with PCSP, Roots left to act as science advisor to the newly created federal Department of the Environment, where he remained on staff until 1989. After retirement, Roots remained an active participant in polar research, and also became a key mentor within the [[Students on Ice]] educational program. He continued to participate in expeditions for Students on Ice well into his tenth decade, his last being to Greenland only two months before his death.

==Early life==

Fred Roots was born in [[Salmon Arm]],&lt;ref name=cbcobit&gt;{{cite news|title= Polar explorer Fred Roots remembered as 'unsung Canadian hero' |author= Tukker, Paul |date= 30 October 2016 |url= http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/fred-roots-polar-explorer-obituary-1.3826145 |website= CBC News |publisher= CBC/Radio-Canada |access-date= 4 November 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Shuswap Country]] of southern [[British Columbia]], Canada, on 5 July 1923.&lt;ref name=GMdeath /&gt; He was the second child of Margaret and Ernest Roots. His father was an engineer with the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]], and while Fred was a small child the family moved to [[Banff, Alberta]], when Ernest was appointed Chief Engineer at the company's [[Banff Springs Hotel]].&lt;ref name=GMobit&gt;{{Cite news|author= Fitterman, Lisa |url= https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/fred-roots-was-modest-brilliant-and-a-legend-of-polar-exploration/article32686729/ |title= Fred Roots was modest, brilliant and a legend of polar exploration |date= 4 November 2016 |access-date= 4 November 2016 |newspaper= [[The Globe and Mail]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, Roots spent much of his childhood surrounded by the high ranges of the [[Canadian Rockies]].&lt;ref name=ottawacitizen&gt;{{cite news|title= Q&amp;A Fred Roots: Canada's 'greatest living explorer' |url= http://ottawacitizen.com/news/local-news/qa-fred-roots-canadas-greatest-living-explorer |author= Crawford, Blair |date= 13 August 2016 |newspaper= [[Ottawa Citizen]] |publisher= Postmedia |access-date= 4 November 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Growing up among the mountains instilled in Roots a lasting love of outdoor exploration and geology.

However, when Roots was only eight years old his father died from [[typhoid fever]], leaving his mother to bring up the family's three children on her own.&lt;ref name=GMobit /&gt; As a young high school student Roots was appointed as an assistant meteorological observer for the [[Banff National Park]]. His duties involved climbing to the summit of a mountain within the park, to service the weather observation station located there. Later in his high school career he moved west to Vancouver, and completed his schooling at Vancouver Technical College.&lt;ref name=GMobit /&gt;

During the Second World War he was a student the [[University of British Columbia]], from where he graduated with a bachelor's degree in geological engineering. He remained at the same institution to continue his postgraduate education, and completed a master's degree thesis on the geology of the [[Aiken Lake]] map-area, in the [[Cassiar Mountains]] of northern British Columbia, in 1947.&lt;ref name=masters&gt;{{Cite thesis|last= Roots |first= Ernest Frederick |date= 1947 |title= Geology of the Aiken Lake map-area, British Columbia |type= MASc |publisher= University of British Columbia |url= https://open.library.ubc.ca/cIRcle/collections/ubctheses/831/items/1.0107001 |access-date= 4 November 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was during this work that he first became involved with the [[Geological Survey of Canada]] (GSC), as he worked alongside the survey's staff geologist J.E. Armstrong to map the mineral-rich district. The same district provided the subject matter for his doctoral research which followed at [[Princeton University]], from where he graduated with a Ph.D. degree in 1950.&lt;ref name=doctorate&gt;{{Cite thesis|last= Roots |first= Ernest Frederick |date= 1950 |title= Geology and mineral deposits of the Aiken Lake map-area, British Columbia |type= PhD |publisher= [[Princeton University]] |url= https://pulsearch.princeton.edu/catalog/2703098 |access-date= 4 November 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Polar and Himalayan exploration==

In 1949, at the age of 26, Roots was appointed Chief Geologist for the [[Norwegian–British–Swedish Antarctic Expedition]], the first exploratory expedition to [[Antarctica]] to involve an international team of scientists.&lt;ref name=cangeo&gt;{{cite web|title= Canada's Greatest Explorers 2015: Fred Roots |url= http://www.canadiangeographic.com/canadian-explorers/canadian-explorer.asp?explorername=Fred-Roots&amp;id=23 |author= Walker, Nick |website= CanadianGeographic.com |publisher= [[Royal Canadian Geographical Society]] |access-date= 4 November 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Roots's role was to study the geology of [[Queen Maud Land]], which he showed was a conjugate part of and had once been attached to the east coast of southern Africa.&lt;ref name=spri&gt;{{Cite web|title= Norwegian-British-Swedish Antarctic Expedition, 1949-1952 |url= http://www.spri.cam.ac.uk/resources/expeditions/nbsx/ |website= Scott Polar Research Institute |publisher= University of Cambridge |access-date= 4 November 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hoffman&gt;{{Cite journal|author= Hoffman, Paul F. |title= The Tooth of Time: Charlie Roots |url= https://journals.lib.unb.ca/index.php/gc/article/view/20078/23208 |journal= [[Geoscience Canada]] |volume= 39 |issue= 4 |pages= 185–194 |year= 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to his geological observations, Roots also helped to show that the glaciers of Antarctica had once been much more extensive, and that the phenomenon of climate change was a global effect and not limited to discrete locations. During the course of the expedition, Roots undertook a 189-day, unsupported [[dog sled]] journey across the continent. This feat of endurance remained a record even at the time of his death, over six decades later.&lt;ref name=cbcobit /&gt; For the rest of his life, Roots regularly wore a belt made from leather taken from the [[Trace (tack)|traces]] of his lead dog of that expedition, Rachel.&lt;ref name=cbcobit /&gt;

==Public service==

Following his return from the southern hemisphere in 1952, Roots completed the remainder of his fellowship at the [[Scott Polar Research Institute]] at [[Cambridge University]]. It was during this time that he met and fell in love with one of the Institute's librarians, June Blomfield, herself a highly educated geographer and passionate outdoorswoman.&lt;ref name=GMobit /&gt;

===Geological Survey of Canada===
At the end of his fellowship in Cambridge, Roots was appointed as a field geologist with the GSC, based at the survey's head office in [[Ottawa]], Ontario. His first major publication for the survey in 1953 was essentially a reworking of his extensive research in the Cassiar Mountains, conducted during his MSc and PhD studies, but he rapidly became a part of the GSC's active field research programs at the time. Fred and June eventually married in 1955, and June moved out to Canada to be with her new husband.

Under [[Yves Fortier (geologist)|Y.O. Fortier]], he was co-leader of the GSC's [[Operation Franklin]] in 1955, that first established the potential for economic petroleum deposits in the high Arctic islands of Canada.&lt;ref name=above&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://arcticjournal.ca/tribute-to-an-explorers-life/ |title= Tribute to an Explorer’s life |date= 1 March 2016 |website= Above &amp; Beyond  – Canada's Arctic Journal |access-date= 4 November 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1956 and 1958 Roots was, in turn, head of [[Operation Stikine]], the GSC's first systematic attempt to map the geology of the northern portion of the [[Canadian Cordillera]] of British Columbia and [[Yukon]].&lt;ref name=above /&gt;

===Polar Continental Shelf Program===
In 1958, Roots left the GSC to become the founding head of the Government of Canada's new [[Polar Continental Shelf Program]] (PCSP). PCSP was set up to promote research in Canada's Arctic north, principally by providing logistical and practical support for government and academic scientists active in the area, and Roots had largely been responsible for conceiving of and establishing the novel organization.&lt;ref name=hoffman /&gt; During his time with PCSP, Roots was a key part of the team that outlined the need for a permanent establishment to conduct research on the icefields of the [[Kluane National Park]] of southwest Yukon, part of the largest non-polar icefield in the world. In the years that followed, the Kluane Lake Research Station also became a hub for exploration across Canada's north, and Roots himself used it as a base from which to organize expeditions through the [[Saint Elias Mountains]], Canada's highest mountain range, as part of the [[Canadian Centennial]] celebrations in 1967.&lt;ref name=whstar&gt;{{Cite news|author= Reynolds, Christopher |title= Geologist traversed Yukon by bike, canoe before diagnosis |url= http://whitehorsestar.com/News/geologist-traversed-yukon-by-bike-canoe-before-diagnosis |newspaper= [[Whitehorse Daily Star]] |date= 29 August 2014 |access-date= 11 November 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Roots served as head of PCSP for 14 years, until 1971, when he left to join what was to eventually become [[Environment Canada]].

===Department of the Environment===
At the time, the newly established government department was in a state of flux. As science advisor to the [[Minister of the Environment (Canada)|Minister of the Environment]], Roots was instrumental in helping design the department's structure and objectives, and has been credited with giving it "the scientific credibility, the moral authority and knowledge that enabled it to play its role."&lt;ref name=ottcitobit&gt;{{Cite news|author= Spears, Tom |title= Obituary: Revered explorer Fred Roots was also key to development of environment ministry |url= http://ottawacitizen.com/news/local-news/obituary-revered-explorer-fred-roots-was-also-key-to-development-of-environment-ministry |newspaper= [[Ottawa Citizen]] |publisher= Postmedia |date= 27 October 2016 |access-date= 4 November 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He remained with Environment Canada until his retirement from public service in 1989, and subsequently retained a role with the department as an emeritus scientist and advisor until 2003.&lt;ref name=GMobit /&gt;

==Life after retirement==

Following his retirement, Roots and his wife moved back to British Columbia from their home in [[Gatineau]], [[Quebec]].

In the mid-1990s, at a meeting of the [[Canadian Polar Commission]] in Ottawa, Roots met explorer and educator [[Geoff Green (explorer)|Geoff Green]]. At the time, Green was attempting to launch a new educational initiative aimed at providing opportunities for secondary school students to visit and explore polar regions. The scheme, [[Students on Ice]], struck a chord with Roots and he agreed to support its formation. Green has credited Roots with being one of the program's "founding fathers".&lt;ref name=cbcobit /&gt; Over the following two decades, Roots participated in many polar expeditions for Students on Ice, and acted as a mentor to hundreds of students from around the world.

Roots's final Arctic exploration was as part of a Students on Ice expedition to [[Greenland]] in August 2016. Later the same month he travelled to New York to receive the [[Explorers Club Medal]] from [[The Explorers Club]]. Previous recipients of the award include explorers Sir [[Edmund Hillary]] and [[Roald Amundsen]], primatologist [[Jane Goodall]], and astronaut [[Neil Armstrong]].&lt;ref name=cbcobit /&gt;

E.F. "Fred" Roots died peacefully in his sleep at home in [[East Sooke]] on [[Vancouver Island]], British Columbia, on 18 October 2016. He was 93 years old. He was survived by June and four of their five children. He was predeceased earlier the same year by his son, Charlie Roots, who had himself been a geologist and explorer with the Geological Survey of Canada.

==Awards and recognition==

*[[Polar Medal]] awarded by the [[Sovereign of the United Kingdom]] (1956)&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue= 40692 |date= 24 January 1956 |page= 499 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*[[Gold Medal (RGS)|Gold Medal]] of the [[Royal Geographical Society]] (1965)
*[[Massey Medal]] of the [[Royal Canadian Geographical Society]] (1979)
*Officer of the [[Order of Canada]] (1987)
*Fellow of the [[Royal Society of Canada]] (1990)
*[[Explorers Club Medal]] of [[The Explorers Club]] (2016)

===Namesake locations===
In recognition of his exemplary service in the exploration and scientific investigation of the Antarctic continent, a number of places and geographic features on the landmass have been named in honour of Roots. [[Roots Heights]] ([[Norwegian language|Norwegian]]: ''{{lang|no|Rootshorga}}''; {{coord|72|37|S|00|27|E|display=inline}}), named in 1966, is an area of high ground at the top of an ice-free, flat-topped mountain, approximately central within the [[Sverdrup Mountains]] of Queen Maud Land.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title= GNIS Detail – Roots Heights |url= http://geonames.usgs.gov/apex/f?p=136:3:0::NO::P3_ANTAR_ID,P3_TITLE:12885,Roots%20Heights |work= Geographic Names Information System |publisher= [[United States Geological Survey]] |access-date= 4 November 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the western side of Roots Heights is a large glacial [[cirque]], named [[Fred Cirque]] ([[Norwegian language|Norwegian]]: ''{{lang|no|Fredbotnen}}''; {{coord|72|34|S|00|25|E|display=inline}}) also in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title= GNIS Detail – Fred Cirque |url= http://geonames.usgs.gov/apex/f?p=136:3:0::NO::P3_ANTAR_ID,P3_TITLE:5270,Fred%20Cirque |work= Geographic Names Information System |publisher= [[United States Geological Survey]] |access-date= 4 November 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both features were mapped by Norwegian cartographers during the course of the Norwegian–British–Swedish Antarctic Expedition for which Roots was Chief Geologist. Multiple biographical articles and obituaries claim that an entire range of mountains on Antarctica is named for Roots, but there appears to be no evidence for this in gazetteers and geographic name directories.

===Namesake fossil===
During his master's thesis research in the Aiken Lake area of northern British Columbia, Roots collected samples of fossils to assist in correlation and dating of the various rock units that he examined there. One of these samples contained a sponge reef fauna which included a species of [[Archaeocyatha]] that had not yet been formally described. Fortunately for Roots, on the faculty of the Department of Geology at the University of British Columbia was [[Vladimir Okulitch]], a paleontologist who specialized in Archaeocytha fossils. Okulitch named the species ''Protopharetra rootsi'', meaning 'Roots's first [[quiver]]',&lt;ref name=okulitch&gt;{{Cite journal|title= Lower Cambrian fossils from Aiken Lake area, British Columbia |author1= Okulitch, V.L. |author2= Roots, E.F. |year= 1947 |journal= Royal Society of Canada, Transactions |volume= 41 |pages= 37–46 }}&lt;/ref&gt; recognizing both the finder of the fossil as well as its shape.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8942">[[File:Congo Brazzaville Topography.png|thumb|right|Topography of the Republic of the Congo]]
The '''geology of the Republic of the Congo''', also known as Congo-Brazzaville, to differentiate from the [[geology of the Democratic Republic of the Congo|Democratic Republic of the Congo]], formerly Zaire, includes extensive [[igneous rock|igneous]] and [[metamorphic rock|metamorphic]] [[basement (geology)|basement rock]], some up to two billion years old and sedimentary rocks formed within the past 250 million years. Much of the country's geology is hidden by sediments formed in the past 2.5 million years of the [[Quaternary]].

== Stratigraphy &amp; tectonics ==
[[File:Cratons West Gondwana.svg|thumb|right|Cratons of Western Gondwana]]
The [[Congo Craton]] is the geologically stable remnant of an early continent. It is the basement rock for much of central Africa and extends through the Republic of Congo and into Gabon, as far as Cameroon, as the [[granitoid]] [[Chaillu Massif]]. The Massif has two generations of 2.7 billion year old granitoids dating to the [[Archean]] and a north-south [[foliation]]. The rocks range from gray [[granodiorite]] to [[quartz biotite]] or [[biotite]] and [[amphibole]] rich endmembers. Pink-colored potassic [[migmatite]] is found in veins within the rock. At a few points, much older greenstone and granitoid schist remain in place and never experienced full [[granitization]].

Republic of Congo has two relict [[greenstone belts]] at Mayoko and Zanago. Greenstone belts have sequences of metamorphic and volcanic rock that preserve ancient tectonics from the Archean. The Mayoko greenstone belt has banded iron, amphibolite, biotite gneiss and pyroxene-rich amphibolite sequences. At Zanago, the belt is slightly different, with amphibolite-bearing quartzite, residual [[pyroxenite]] in amphibolites and small amounts of [[dunite]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Schluter |first=Thomas |year=2006 |title=Geological Atlas of Africa |url=http://www.geokniga.org/bookfiles/geokniga-geological-atlas-africa.pdf |publisher=Springer |p=84-85}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Proterozoic ===
In the northwest of the country, the [[Sembe-Ouesso Group]] spans into Gabon and Cameroon, beneath overlying [[mixtite]] formations. The Sembe-Ouesso Group  has ascending sequences of [[quartzite]], [[shale]], [[phyllite]], calc-shale, [[dolomite]] and another layer of quartzite. Some geologists debate whether the sequence dates to the [[Paleoproterozoic]] or [[Neoproterozoic]].
 
The Neoproterozoic West Congolian Supergroup, is one of three parts of the West Congolian mobile belt, a tectonic feature that runs for 1300 kilometers from Gabon through southwest Republic of Congo to Angola. Geologists subdivide the West Congolian Supergroup into the [[Haut Shiloango Group]], the [[Schisto-Calcaire Group]], [[Sansikwa Group]], [[Mpioka Group]] and [[Inkisi Group]]. Previously, geologists interpreted two pebbly schist and mixtite layers, that separate the Sansikwa Group, Haut Shiloango Group and the Schisto-Calcaire Group as glacial deposits, but now they are believed to be the remains of mud flows. {{sfn|Schluter|2006|p=84}}

=== Paleozoic-Mesozoic ===
As central Africa entered the [[Phanerozoic]], the current geologic eon in which multicellular plant and animal life is commonplace, sedimentary rocks were deposited in what may have been failed rift valleys. These rocks are mainly found in the Congo Basin, a structural tectonic feature that extends into neighboring [[Democratic Republic of Congo]], formed within the Congo Craton. Because of thick layers of sediment atop the craton in central Africa, remoteness and sparse research from boreholes and seismic lines, the exact origins of many of these sedimentary units remains unclear. Geologists currently interpret many of the sedimentary sequences from the [[Late Permian]] into the [[Triassic]] as the remains of the Karoo rifting period. During the Karoo period, southern Gondwana rifted across a large area encompassing what is now southern South America and South Africa. The rift basin and surrounding regions were cloaked in thick layers of continental sediment and sedimentation accelerated when Gondwana drifted over the South Pole, causing massive glaciation of Africa in the [[Karoo Ice Age]]. Ultimately, the glaciers melted at the end of the Permian, creating a swampy delta environment. Rocks directly preserving this sequence are found in the [[Karoo Supergroup]], one of the most extensive stratigraphic units in southern Africa. 
With slow subsidence in the [[Cretaceous]] at the [[Mesozoic]], the Congo Basin experienced slow subsidence and filled with one kilometer of sediments. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite article |author=Kadima et. al. |year=2011|title=Structure and geological history of the Congo Basin: an integrated interpretation of gravity, magnetic and reflection seismic data|publisher=Basin Research|url=http://www.africamuseum.be/publication_docs/2011_Kadima-al_BasinResearch.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cenozoic ===
Within the past 66 million years, the Congo Basin has continued to sag, surrounded by topographic highs on all sides. In the [[Miocene]], the basin closed due to flank uplift at the Atlantic rifted margin and gorges and rapids formed in the [[Mayombe]] mountains. {{sfn|Kadima et. al.|2011|p=499}}

== Hydrogeology ==
In the interior, along the [[Congo River]], most groundwater is stored in permeable unconsolidated Congo Basin alluvium, which can be up to {{convert|400|m|ft}} thick. Small areas of this unconsolidated Quaternary alluvium are also found near the Atlantic coast. The Coastal basin aquifer is made up of Cenozoic clay-rich sands, dolomitic sandstones and dolomitic limestone with low hardness and a neutral pH but relatively high salinity and sulfide. The unit is known from exploratory wells drilled in search of potash, water and petroleum. The Stanley Pool series beneath Brazzaville is primarily sandstone with some [[kaolinite]] and [[marl]] mixed in. In other parts of the center of the country, shallow boreholes into the [[Bateke Plateau]] sandstone series are used for local water supplies. Groundwater is also found in the Late [[Precambrian]] Inkisi series, Mpioka series and schist-limestone in the [[Djoue Valley]] as well as some fractured [[schist]], [[granite]], [[gneiss]] and quartzite basement rock. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite article |title=Hydrogeology of Republic of Congo|publisher=British Geological Survey|url=http://earthwise.bgs.ac.uk/index.php/Hydrogeology_of_Republic_of_Congo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of geologic research ==
The Republic of Congo was included in widespread stratigraphic research of the [[Congo Basin]] in the late 1950s, with drill cores preserved at the Royal Museum for Central Africa in Belgium. Oil related research continued in the 1970s and up until 1984, spanning into [[Zaire]] (the former name of the Democratic Republic of Congo), by [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]], [[Texaco]] and Japan National Oil Company.{{sfn|Kadima et. al.|2011|p=499}}

== Natural resource geology ==

[[File:Cominco location ROC.jpg|thumb|right|Map of Hinza phosphate prospect in the Republic of the Congo]]
Natural resources, both minerals and petroleum, are important contributors to the [[economy of the Republic of Congo]]. Crude oil makes up 50% percent of the government's revenue and 90% of exports, with almost all drilling offshore. 
Two metal mines, at Djenguile and Yanga-Koubenza, {{convert|290|km|mi}} west of Brazzaville extract [[zinc]], [[lead]] and [[copper]]. Unexploited [[niobium]], [[tantalum]], [[uranium]], [[manganese]], [[titanium]], [[nickel]], [[chromium]], [[thorium]], [[gold]] and [[tungsten]] are known from geochemical analysis of the [[Mayombe Supergroup]]. Many of the same minerals may also be found in the [[Paleoproterozoic]] [[Sembe-Ouesso Group]].

Placer [[diamond]]s are found in the [[Bikosi Conglomerate]], likely dating to the [[Early Cretaceous]]. The [[Archean]] [[Caillu Massif]] hosts [[itabirite]] iron ore and gold, associated with [[amphibolite]], although these resources are not extensively mined except by artesanal methods. 

The Republic of Congo also has a {{convert|50|km|mi}} belt of phosphate outcrops along the coast, with large deposits at Sintou Kola and Holle, 50 kilometers from Pointe Noire. Phosphate nodules, {{convert|110|km|mi}} west of Brazzaville, close to Comba, are believed to be of [[Neoproterozoic]] age.{{sfn|Schluter|2006|p=86-87}}

{{refimprove|date=November 2012}}
The '''Great Rift Valley''' is a continuous geographic trench, approximately {{convert|6000|km|mi|-2}} in length, that runs from [[Lebanon|Lebanon's]] [[Beqaa Valley]] in Asia to [[Mozambique]] in Southeastern Africa.&lt;ref name="webster1997"&gt;{{cite book|author=Merriam-Webster, Inc 편집부|title=MERRIAM WEBSTER'S GEOGRAPHICAL DICTIONARY 3/E(H)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Co_VIPIJerIC&amp;pg=PA444|accessdate=22 November 2012|year=1997|publisher=Merriam-Webster|isbn=978-0-87779-546-9|pages=444}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name continues in some usages, although it is today considered geologically imprecise as it combines features that are today regarded as separate, although related, [[rift]] and [[fault (geology)|fault]] systems.

Today, the term is most often used to refer to the valley of the [[East African Rift]], the divergent [[plate boundary]] which extends from the [[Afar Triple Junction]] southward across eastern [[Africa]], and is in the process of splitting the [[African Plate]] into two new separate plates. Geologists generally refer to these incipient plates as the [[Nubia]]n Plate and the [[Somali Plate]].

==Theoretical extent==

[[File:MapGreatRiftValley.png|thumb|Map of the Great Rift Valley]]
The Great Rift Valley as originally described was thought to extend from [[Lebanon]] in the north to [[Mozambique]] in the south, where it constitutes one of two distinct physiographic provinces of the [[East African mountains]]. It included what we would call today the Lebanese section of the [[Dead Sea Transform]], the [[Jordan Rift Valley]], [[Red Sea Rift]] and the [[East African Rift]].&lt;ref name="BriggsBlatt2009"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Philip Briggs|author2=Brian Blatt|title=Ethiopia: the Bradt travel guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QFb6pacaczsC&amp;pg=PA450|accessdate=22 November 2012|date=15 July 2009|publisher=Bradt Travel Guides|isbn=978-1-84162-284-2|pages=450}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today these rifts and faults are seen as distinct, although connected. These were only formed 35 million years ago.

==Asia==
{{Further|Sinai Peninsula}}
[[File:Greatrift.jpg|thumb|150px|left|The [[Sinai Peninsula]] at center and the [[Dead Sea]] and [[Jordan Valley (Middle East)|Jordan Valley]] above]]
The northernmost part of the Rift corresponds to the central section of what is called today the [[Dead Sea Transform]] (DST) or Rift. This midsection of the DST forms the [[Beqaa Valley]] in Lebanon, separating the [[Lebanon Mountains|Lebanon]] from the [[Anti-Lebanon Mountains]]. Further south it is known as the [[Hula Valley]] separating the [[Galilee]] mountains and the [[Golan Heights]].&lt;ref name="YirguEbinger2006"&gt;{{cite book|author1=G. Yirgu|author2=C. J. (Cindy J.) Ebinger|author3=P. K. H. Maguire|title=The Afar Volcanic Province Within the East African Rift System: Special Publication No 259|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-NoKEx_AnUEC&amp;pg=PA133|accessdate=22 November 2012|year=2006|publisher=Geological Society|isbn=978-1-86239-196-3|pages=306–307}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Jordan River]] begins here and flows southward through [[Lake Hula]] into the [[Sea of Galilee]] in [[Israel]]. The Rift then continues south through the [[Jordan Rift Valley]] into the [[Dead Sea]] on the [[Israel]]i-[[Jordan]]ian border. From the Dead Sea southwards, the Rift is occupied by the Wadi [[Arabah]], then the [[Gulf of Aqaba]], and then the [[Red Sea]].&lt;ref name="YirguEbinger2006" /&gt;

Off the southern tip of Sinai in the Red Sea, the [[Dead Sea Transform]] meets the [[Red Sea Rift]] which runs the length of the Red Sea. The Red Sea Rift comes ashore to meet the [[East African Rift]] and the [[Aden Ridge]] in the [[Afar Depression]] of East Africa. The junction of these three rifts is called the [[Afar Triple Junction]].&lt;ref name="YirguEbinger2006" /&gt;

==Africa==
{{Main|East African Rift}}
[[File:Great Rift Valley.png|thumb|East African Rift Valley]]
[[File:EAfrica.png|thumb|550px|A map of East Africa showing some of the historically active [[volcano]]es (red triangles) and the [[Afar Triangle]] (shaded, center)—a [[triple junction]] where three plates are pulling away from one another: the [[Arabian Plate]], and the two parts of the [[African Plate]] (the Nubian and the Somali) splitting along the East African Rift Zone ([[USGS]]).]] The East African rift has two branches, the [[Western Rift Valley]] and the [[Eastern Rift Valley]].

The Western Rift, also called the [[Albertine Rift]], is bordered by some of the highest mountains in Africa, including the [[Virunga Mountains]], [[Mitumba Mountains]], and [[Ruwenzori Range]]. It contains the [[Rift Valley lakes]], which include some of the deepest lakes in the world (up to {{convert|1470|m}} deep at [[Lake Tanganyika]]).

Much of this area lies within the boundaries of national parks such as [[Virunga National Park]] in the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]], [[Rwenzori National Park]] and [[Queen Elizabeth National Park]] in [[Uganda]], and [[Volcanoes National Park]] in [[Rwanda]]. [[Lake Victoria]] is considered to be part of the rift valley system although it actually lies between the two branches. All of the [[Great Lakes (Africa)|African Great Lakes]] were formed as the result of the rift, and most lie within its rift valley.

In [[Kenya]], the valley is deepest to the north of [[Nairobi]]. As the lakes in the Eastern Rift have no outlet to the sea and tend to be shallow, they have a high [[mineral]] content as the evaporation of water leaves the salts behind. For example, [[Lake Magadi]] has high concentrations of soda ([[sodium carbonate]]) and [[Lake Elmenteita]], [[Lake Bogoria]], and [[Lake Nakuru]] are all strongly [[alkaline]], while the freshwater springs supplying [[Lake Naivasha]] are essential to support its current biological variety.

The southern section of the Rift Valley includes [[Lake Malawi]], the third-deepest freshwater body in the world, reaching {{Convert|706|m|}} in depth and separating the [[Niassa Province|Nyassa]] plateau of Northern Mozambique from Malawi; it ends in the [[Zambezi]] valley.

'''Gu Yanwu''' ({{zh|t=顧炎武}}) (July 15, 1613 – February 15, 1682), also known as '''Gu Tinglin''' ({{zh|c=顧亭林}}), was a Chinese philologist and geographer. He spent his youth during the [[Manchu conquest of China]] in [[anti-Manchuism|anti-Manchu]] activities after the [[Ming Dynasty]] had been overthrown. He never served the [[Qing Dynasty]]. Instead, he traveled throughout the country and devoted himself to studies.

==Biography==
[[File:Statue of Gu Yanwu in Tinglin Park, Kunshan.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Statue of Gu Yanwu in Tinglin Park, Kunshan]]
Gu, a native of [[Jiangsu]], was born as '''Gu Jiang''' ({{zh|t=顧絳|s=顾绛|p=Gù Jiàng}}). Gu began his schooling at the age of 14. In the spring of 1645, Gu was recommended to be the position of ''Bingbu Siwu'' in the royal court at [[Nanjing]]. There he proposed many ideas. Unsatisfied with the royal court's organisation, Gu resigned and returned to his hometown. In 1655, local officials laid charges against him and threw him into prison. He was released from prison with the help of a friend.

Inspired by [[Chen Di]], who had demonstrated that the [[Old Chinese]] has its own phonological system, Gu divided the words of Old Chinese into 10 rhyme groups, the first one to do so. His positivist approach to a variety of disciplines, and his criticism of [[Neo-Confucianism]] had a huge influence on later scholars. His works include ''Yinxue Wushu'' (音學五書), ''Ri Zhi Lu'' (日知錄) and ''Zhao Yu Zhi'' (肇域志).

Along with [[Wang Fuzhi]] and [[Huang Zongxi]], Gu was named as one of the most outstanding Confucian scholars of the late Ming and early Qing Dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guoxue.com/rw/guyanwu/gyw02.htm |script-title=zh:顾炎武 |trans-title=Gu Yanwu |work=Guoxue |publisher=Beijing Culture Communication Company [北京国学时代文化传播] |accessdate=2011-10-10|language=zh}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1682, while returning from a friend's home to [[Huaying]], Gu fell from horseback and died the next day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.163.com/06/1229/10/33GKUMB100011KUQ.html |script-title=zh:顾炎武：天下兴亡，匹夫有责_网易新闻中心 |trans-title=Gu Yanwu: the rise and fall of every man's duty |work=163 |date=2006-12-29 |accessdate=2011-10-10|language=zh}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aphorism==
"''Everybody is responsible for the fate of the world''" ({{zh|c=天下興亡，匹夫有責|p=tiān xià xīng wáng, pǐ fū yǒu zé}})

Alternatively, ''The rise and fall of the nation concerns everyone''; or ''Everyone bears responsibility for the prosperity of society''.

==Legacy==
Gu is commemorated by [[Tinglin Park]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.ks.js.cn/a/zt/2010/1010/62977.html |script-title=zh:历史悠久的亭林公园 |trans-title=Historic Tinglin Park |date=2010-10-10 |work=News Kunshan |publisher=China Telecom|language=zh}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Gu Yanwu Museum in Tinglin Park of [[Kunshan]]. In 2005, the [[Publicity Department of the Communist Party of China|Central Propaganda Department]] of China named the Gu Yanwu Museum located at Gu's former residence in [[Qiandeng town]] as a "national patriotism education base".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/ziliao/2004-10/14/content_2088215_15.htm |work=Xinhuanet |publisher=Xinhua |title=江苏省爱国主义教育示范基地 |trans-title=Patriotism education bases in Jiangsu Province |date=2004-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Former residence of Gu Yanwu==
The former residence of Gu Yanwu is located in [[Qiandeng town]] of [[Kunshan]], a Ming dynasty complex with main hall, living quarter, a study
and a garden. Gu Yanwu's grave is located in a quiet corner of the garden.

The '''Hellenic Military Geographical Service''' or '''HMGS''' ({{lang-el|Γεωγραφική Υπηρεσία Στρατού}} or Γ.Υ.Σ.), is the [[Hellenic Army|Greek military]] mapping agency.

==History==
Established in 1889 as the “Geodetic Mission” with the purpose of compiling the “Topographic and Cadastral Map of the Country”, the service acquired its current name in 1926. Today it supports both the [[Greek Army]] and the general public with cartographic products.&lt;ref&gt;a brief history of GYS can be found in the Service's website (in Greek/English), http://web.gys.gr/portal/page?_pageid=33,36335&amp;_dad=portal&amp;_schema=PORTAL&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1966 until the 1980s, the service housed the [[Armed Forces Information Service]], Greece's second state-run broadcaster alongside the [[National Radio Foundation]].

==Maps==

===City plans===

HMGS supplies City Plans of scales 1:5.000, 1:10.000 and 1:25.000 in Greek and Latin series

*1:5.000 scale: covers 20 cities in [[Greece]]
*1:10.000 scale: covers 16 cities in [[Greece]]

===Topographic maps===

HMGS produces and supplies topographic maps of various scales that cover the whole country and occasionally parts of neighbouring countries. It should be emphasised that not all maps noted below are available to public, since part of them is confidential and available only upon approval of HMGS. Although not a state monopoly and not very famous among hikers, certainly HMGS maps have a much wider coverage in small scales than commercial leisure maps. The maps used the [[Hellenic Geodetic Reference System 1987]] (HGRS87 or ΕΓΣΑ'87) which specifies a Transverse Mercatorial Projection mapping Greece in one zone. 

*1:25.000 scale - 26 maps available for regions near [[Athens]]
*1:50.000 scale - approximately 385 maps
*1:100.000 scale - around 130 maps available
*1:250.000 scale - 32 maps available
*1:500.000 scale - 10 maps available
*1:1.000.000 scale - 5 maps available

==Availability==
The products and services of HMGS are not available in the market. They can either be purchased using the e-shop of the service or collected from the offices of the service upon submitting the relevant request form.&lt;ref&gt;http://web.gys.gr/portal/page?_pageid=33,36288&amp;_dad=portal&amp;_schema=PORTAL&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Muḥammad Abū’l-Qāsim Ibn Ḥawqal''' ({{lang|ar|محمد أبو القاسم بن حوقل}}), also known as  '''Abū al-Qāsim b. ʻAlī Ibn Ḥawqal al-Naṣībī''',  born in [[Nisibis]], [[Upper Mesopotamia]];&lt;ref&gt;[[Svat Soucek|Soucek, Svat]], ''A History of Inner Asia'' ([[Cambridge University Press]]:2000), p.73.&lt;/ref&gt; was a 10th-century [[Arab]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jean-Charles|first1=Ducène,|title=Ibn Ḥawqal|url=http://referenceworks.brillonline.com/entries/encyclopaedia-of-islam-3/ibn-hawqal-COM_30810|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Muslim]] writer, geographer, and chronicler who travelled 943-969 AD.&lt;ref name="Ludwig 2009"&gt;[[Ludwig W. Adamec]] (2009), ''Historical Dictionary of Islam'', p.137. Scarecrow Press. {{ISBN|0810861615}}.&lt;/ref&gt; His famous work, written in 977 AD, is called ''Ṣūrat al-’Arḍ'' ({{lang|ar|صورة الارض}}; "The face of the Earth"). The date of his death, known from his writings, was after 368AH/978AD.

==Biography== 
Details known of Ibn Hawqal's life are extrapolated from his book.  He spent the last 30 years of his life traveling to the remote parts of [[Asia]] and [[Africa]] and writing about what he saw. One journey brought him 20° south of the equator along the [[East Africa]]n coast where he discovered large populations in regions the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] writers had deemed, from logic rather than knowledge, were uninhabitable.

==Ṣūrat al-’Arḍ==
Ibn Hawqal based his great work of geography on a revision and augmentation of the text called ''Masālik ul-Mamālik'' by [[Istakhri]] (951 AD), which itself was a revised edition of the ''Ṣuwar al-aqālīm'' by [[Ahmed ibn Sahl al-Balkhi]], (ca. 921 AD).  However Ibn Hawqal was more than an editor, he was travel writer writing in the style followed later by [[Abu Ubaydallah al-Bakri]] in his ''Kitab al-Masālik wa-al-Mamālik'' ("Book of Routes and Realms"), a literary genre which uses reports of merchants and travellers. Ibn Hawqal introduces 10th century humour into his account of Sicily during the [[Kalbids|Kalbid-Fatimid]] dynasty. As a primary source his medieval geography tends to exaggeration and his depiction of the barbaric uncivilised Christians of Palermo, reflects the prevailing politics of his time.  Yet his geographic accounts of his personal travels were relied upon, and found useful, by medieval Arab travellers. 

The chapters on [[Al-Andalus]], in Muslim-held [[Spain]], and particularly on [[Sicily]], describe  the richly cultivated area of [[Fraxinet]] ([[La Garde-Freinet]]), and detail a number of regional innovations practiced by Muslim farmers and fishermen.
The chapter on the [[Byzantine Empire]] - known in the Muslim world as, and called by the Byzantines themselves, the "Lands of the Romans" - gives his first-hand observation of the 360 languages spoken in the [[Caucasus]], with the [[Lingua franca|Lingua Franca]] being  [[Azeri language|Azeri]] and [[Persian language|Persian]] across the region.  With the description of [[Kiev]], he may have mentioned the route of the [[Volga Bulgars]] and the [[Khazar]]s, which was perhaps taken from [[Sviatoslav I of Kiev]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/pages/A/R/Arabs.htm Encyclopedia of Ukraine]&lt;/ref&gt; He also published a cartographic map of [[Sindh]] together with accounts of the geography and culture of Sindh and the [[Indus River]].

==Editions==
An anonymous epitome of the book was written in 1233 AD.

In the 1870s the celebrated dutch orientalist [[Michael Jan de Goeje]] edited a selection of MS texts by Arab geographers, which was published by [[Brill publishers|Brill]], [[Leiden]] in an 8-volume series   titled ''Bibliotheca geographorum Arabicorum''.  Ibn Haukal's text was the second volume published in 1873 under the Latin title ''Viae et Regna, descriptio ditionis Moslemicae auctore Abu'l-Kásim Ibn Haukal'' - "Routes and Realms, a description of Muslim territories by the author Abu'l-Kásim Ibn Haukal".

'''Ishango''' is a sub-station of [[Virunga National Park]], situated on the Northern Shores of [[Lake Edward]] in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]].  The station was created in the 1950s and is famous for many reasons:  
*It was referred to by [[George Schaller]] as the most beautiful place in the world for its stunning landscapes.  
*As the source of the [[Semliki River]], where the waters of Lake Edward begin to flow down the [[Albertine Rift]] into [[Lake Albert (Africa)|Lake Albert]], Ishango is one of the sources of the Nile. 
*The [[Ishango Bone]] was discovered there in 1960. This fossilised baboon bone, which was dated at 18,000 BC, has clear markings suggested to be either tally marks, a series of prime numbers, or a lunar calendar.
*In 2005, Ishango became the centre for training congolese park rangers, and programme surported by the [[Frankfurt Zoological Society]] and [[WildlifeDirect]].  
*Ishango is home to the last significant population of hippos on Lake Edward, a lake which formerly held the biggest hippo population in the world.
*[[Human]] bones have been found at Ishango which, although dating only to 20,000 BC, show robust, archaic features.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=I. Crevecoeur et al.|title=Late Stone Age human remains from Ishango (Democratic Republic of Congo): New insights on Late Pleistocene modern human diversity in Africa|journal=Journal of Human Evolution|date=Jul 2016|doi=10.1016/j.jhevol.2016.04.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=[[Eleanor Scerri]]|title=Origin of our species: Why humans were once so much more diverse|journal=New Scientist|date=28 Apr 2018|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg23831750-200-origin-of-our-species-why-humans-were-once-so-much-more-diverse/}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Ishango is currently managed under the leadership of a park warden and five rangers.  It has an airstrip, and administrative building, four houses and some tented accommodations for visitors.  The buildings were rehabilitated by the [[European Development Fund]] in 2007.

Rees|last=Shapiro|date=November 10, 2016|accessdate=April 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an American [[landscape artist]] and [[cartographer]] best known for painting ski [[trail map]]s for ski resorts. He has painted 255 maps for 175 ski resorts around the world.

==Early life==
Niehues was raised on a farm in [[Loma, Colorado]],&lt;ref name=post/&gt; and attended [[Fruita Monument High School]].&lt;ref name=cabinet&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cabinetmagazine.org/issues/15/weyland.php|title=En Piste: An Interview with James Niehues|date=Fall 2004|first=Jocko|last=Weyland|work=[[Cabinet (magazine)|Cabinet]]|accessdate=April 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He began painting at the age of 15, when he fell ill with [[nephritis]] and his mother gave him an oil painting set to keep him occupied while he was bedridden for three months.&lt;ref name=cabinet/&gt;&lt;ref name=nasja&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nasja.org/Awards/16CarsonWhiteNiehaus.html|title=Trail map artist James Niehues has been selected as the recipient of the 2016 North American Snowspnorts Association's James Niehues Carson White Snowsports Achievement Award|publisher=North American Snowsports Journalists' Association|year=2016|accessdate=April 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
After serving in the U.S. Army from 1965 to 1969,&lt;ref name=post/&gt; Niehues worked in advertising, printing and graphic design. In 1987,&lt;ref name=nasja/&gt; while working at a [[Denver]] print shop, he met Bill Brown, a painter of ski resort maps who was nearing retirement. Brown gave him his first assignment as a map painter: a small inset map commissioned by [[Winter Park Resort]] in Colorado.&lt;ref name=flat&gt;{{cite web|url=http://flatheadbeacon.com/2014/11/18/cold-cartography/|title=Cold Cartography|first=Justin|last=Franz|work=Flathead Beacon|date=November 18, 2014|accessdate=April 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his map was accepted by Winter Park, Niehues printed copies of his illustration and sent them to the marketing managers of ski resorts across the U.S. to advertise his map-painting services. The first resort to respond was [[Vail Ski Resort]], which hired him to paint a new trail map.&lt;ref name=99u&gt;{{cite web|url=http://99u.com/articles/52181/monet-of-the-mountain-how-a-ski-maps-painter-owns-his-niche-market|title=Monet of the Mountain: How a Ski Maps Painter Owns His Niche Market|first=Matt|last=McCue|publisher=99U|accessdate=April 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first ski map that he designed and painted by himself was [[Boreal Mountain Resort]] in California; as of 2016, Niehues' map was still in use, 29 years after it was created.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://journal.alpsandmeters.com/journal/2016/2/8/interview-with-jim-niehues-trail-map-artist|title=The Man Behind the Map|date=February 10, 2016|work=Alps &amp; Meters Journal|accessdate=April 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Niehues' method of painting ski trails begins with aerial photographs of the mountain that he either takes himself or obtains from [[Google Earth]].&lt;ref name=post/&gt; He then sketches the mountain based on the photographs and adds color and detail with watercolor paints and an airbrush.&lt;ref name=times&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/16/travel/ski-trail-map-artist-james-niehues.html?_r=0|work=[[The New York Times]]|title=Rembrandt of the Ski Trail 'Interprets' the Mountainside|date=February 16, 2017|first=Alyson|last=Krueger|accessdate=April 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2016, Niehues had painted 255 maps for 175 ski resorts around the world. The largest resorts he has painted for include [[Aspen Mountain (ski area)|Aspen]] in Colorado, [[Big Sky Resort]] in Montana, [[Boyne Mountain Resort]] in Michigan, [[Killington Ski Resort]] in Vermont, [[Sugarloaf (ski resort)|Sugarloaf]] in Maine, and [[Mont Tremblant Resort]] and [[Whistler Blackcomb]] in Canada.&lt;ref name=nasja/&gt; He estimates that he has created trail maps for 75% of the large ski resorts in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.fortune.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2006/03/06/8370665/index.htm|title=Ski Trail Map Painter |date=March 6, 2006 |work=[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]] |last=Harris|first=Armin}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, his work was displayed in an exhibition at [[Apexart]] in New York City.&lt;ref name=times/&gt; He semi-retired in 2014,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scoutski.com/the-mountain-map-man|title=The Mountain Map Man|date=September 26, 2014|work=Scout|accessdate=April 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and lives in [[Loveland, Colorado]].&lt;ref name=flat/&gt;

Niehues' work has drawn numerous comparisons to famous artists: he has been called "the [[Michelangelo]] of snow",&lt;ref name=post/&gt; "[[Rembrandt]] of the ski trail",&lt;ref name=times/&gt; "[[Monet]] of the mountain",&lt;ref name=99u/&gt; and the "[[Norman Rockwell]] of ski resorts".&lt;ref name=flat/&gt;

'''John Schenebly Kyser''' (September 8, 1900 &amp;ndash; July 14, 1975)&lt;ref name=ssdi&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ssdi.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/ssdi.cgi|title=Social Security Death Index|publisher=ssdi.rootsweb.ancestry.com|accessdate=December 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; was an [[Americans|American]] [[historian]] and [[geographer]] who served as the president of [[Northwestern State University]] in [[Natchitoches, Louisiana|Natchitoches]], [[Louisiana]], from 1954-1966.&lt;ref&gt;''Who's Who in American Education, XXI (1963-1964)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

Kyser was born in [[El Paso, Illinois|El Paso]], a small city in [[Woodford County, Illinois|Woodford County]] in north central [[Illinois]]. His parents were John Hamilton Kyser and the former Elizabeth Schuman. He was educated in Illinois public schools and received his [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree in 1921 from the [[University of Michigan]] at [[Ann Arbor, Michigan|Ann Arbor]], [[Michigan]]. He obtained further education at the [[University of Chicago]], the [[University of California, Berkeley]], and the [[University of Heidelberg]] in [[Heidelberg, Germany|Heidelberg]], [[Germany]], before receiving his [[Ph.D.]] in 1937 from [[Louisiana State University]] at [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana|Baton Rouge]]. His doctoral [[dissertation]] is entitled "The Evolution of Louisiana Parishes in Relation to Growth and Distribution in Population."&lt;ref name=lahist&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lahistory.org/site28.php|title=Kyser, John S.|publisher=[[Louisiana Historical Association]], ''A Dictionary of Louisiana Biography'' (lahistory.org)|accessdate=December 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
From 1921-1923, Kyser served a year each on the faculty of LSU and [[Tulane University]] in [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]].&lt;ref name=lahist/&gt;

==Northwestern State University==

In 1923, he came to Northwestern State, then known as Louisiana [[Normal school|Normal]] College, a teachers' institution. He headed the Department of Social Sciences from 1924 until May 15, 1954,&lt;ref&gt;''Minden Press'', [[Minden, Louisiana]], January 4, 1960, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; at which time he was elevated to the presidency of the institution, then known as Northwestern State College.&lt;ref name=lahist/&gt; Along with several other four-year institutions in the state, NSU was elevated to university status in 1970, when Kyser's successor, [[Arnold R. Kilpatrick]], was serving as the NSU president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nsula.edu/history/|title=Northwestern State University: History|publisher=nsula.edu|accessdate=December 27, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110103053752/http://www.nsula.edu/history|archivedate=January 3, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1935, Kyser organized and developed the first statewide field study-tours with college credit. He was a pioneer of audio-visual education and was instrumental in the development of first closed-circuit television instruction program in Louisiana.&lt;ref name=lahist/&gt; Kyser also launched the first graduate program in any four-year state institution of higher education below the level of LSU. Such programs are now widespread.&lt;ref name=lahist/&gt;

Kyser was the chairman of the Geography Section of the Southwestern Social Sciences Association. He was a president of the North Louisiana Historical Association&lt;ref name=lahist/&gt; and in 1960 headed the [[Louisiana Historical Association]].
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lahistory.org/site8.php|title=Presidents of the Louisiana Historical Association|publisher=lahistory.org|accessdate=December 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family, death, legacy==
On September 8, 1924, Kyser married the former Thelma Zelenka (1898–1998) of [[Houma, Louisiana|Houma]], the seat of [[Terrebonne Parish, Louisiana|Terrebonne Parish]] in south Louisiana. She was a daughter of Dr. Rudolph Louis Zelenka and the former Eva Bazet. The couple had one child, Janet (born 1929).&lt;ref name=lahist/&gt; Thelma Kyser died ten days before her 100th birthday.&lt;ref name=ssdi/&gt; 
  
Kyser died in [[Shreveport, Louisiana|Shreveport]], Louisiana. He is interred beside his wife at Memory Lawn Cemetery in Natchitoches.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Times (Shreveport)|Shreveport Times]]'', ''[[The Town Talk (Alexandria)|Alexandria Daily Town Talk]]'', July 16, 1975&lt;/ref&gt; His papers are located at the [[Eugene P. Watson]] Memorial Library on the NSU campus. A tribute to Kyser is found in a 1975 issue of ''[[North Louisiana History]].''&lt;ref&gt;"In Memoriam: John S. Kyser," ''[[North Louisiana History]]'', then known as the ''Journal of the North Louisiana Historical Association,'' VII, No. 1 (1975), p. 26&lt;/ref&gt;

Kyser Hall, which houses the department of history at NSU, is named in his honor.&lt;ref name=lahist/&gt;

}}'''Lake Parime''' or '''Lake Parima''' is a legendary lake located in [[South America]]. It was reputedly the location of the fabled city of [[El Dorado]], also known as Manoa, much sought-after by European explorers. Repeated attempts to find the lake failed to confirm its existence, and it was dismissed as a myth along with the city. The search for Lake Parime led explorers to map the rivers and other features of southern Venezuela, northern Brazil, and southwestern Guyana before the lake's existence was definitively disproved in the early 19th century. Some explorers proposed that the seasonal flooding of the [[Rupununi savannah]] may have been misidentified as a lake. Recent geological investigations suggest that a lake may have existed in northern Brazil, but that it dried up some time in the 18th century. Both "Manoa" ([[Arawak language]]) and "Parime" ([[Carib language]]) are believed to mean "big lake".&lt;ref name = "Humboldt"&gt;[https://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/h/humboldt/alexander/travels/chapter25.html  Alexander von Humboldt, ''Personal Narrative of Travels to the Equinoctial Regions of America During the Years 1799–1804,'' (chapter 25).

==First attempts at discovery==
===Walter Raleigh, 1595===
{{Further|Raleigh's El Dorado Expedition}}
[[Sir Walter Raleigh]] began the exploration of the [[Guianas]] in earnest in 1594 and described the city of Manoa, which he believed to be the legendary city of [[El Dorado]], as being located on Lake Parime far up the [[Orinoco River]] in [[Venezuela]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=z-_PFgv44QIC&amp;dq= Marc Aronson, ''Sir Walter Ralegh and the Quest for El Dorado'', Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2000.] {{ISBN|039584827X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of his exploration is documented in his books ''The Discoverie of the Large, Rich, and Bewtiful Empyre of Guiana'',&lt;ref name = "Raleigh"&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/2272/2272-h/2272-h.htm Sir Walter Raleigh, ''The Discoverie of the Large, Rich, and Bewtiful Empyre of Guiana''] (1596; repr., Amsterdam: Theatrum Orbis Terrarum, 1968)&lt;/ref&gt; published first in 1596, and ''The Discovery of Guiana, and the Journal of the Second Voyage Thereto'', published in 1606.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=7uFKAAAAYAAJ Sir Walter Raleigh, ''The Discovery of Guiana, and the Journal of the Second Voyage Thereto''] (1606; repr., London: Cassell, 1887)&lt;/ref&gt; How much of Raleigh's work is true and how much is fabricated remains unclear:&lt;ref&gt;Paul R. Sellin, ''Treasure, Treason and the Tower: El Dorado and the Murder of Sir Walter Raleigh''. Burlington, VT: Ashgate, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; His account indicates that he only succeeded in navigating up the Orinoco as far as Angostura, (what is now [[Ciudad Bolívar]]) and did not come close to the supposed location of Lake Parime.&lt;ref name = "Discovery"/&gt; Raleigh says of the lake:

{{quote|I have been assured by such of the Spaniards as have seen Manoa, the imperial city of Guiana, which the Spaniards call El Dorado, that for the greatness, for the riches, and for the excellent seat, it far exceedeth any of the world, at least of so much of the world as is known to the Spanish nation. It is founded upon a lake of salt water of 200 [[League (unit)|leagues]] long, like unto [[Caspian Sea|Mare Caspium]].&lt;ref name = "Raleigh"/&gt;}}

According to Raleigh, the lake itself was the source of the gold possessed by the people of Manoa:
{{quote|Most of the gold which they made in plates and images was not severed from the stone, but on the lake of Manoa, and in a multitude of other rivers, they gathered it in grains of perfect gold and in pieces as big as small stones.&lt;ref name = "Raleigh"/&gt;}}

===Lawrence Kemys, 1596===
In 1596 Raleigh sent his lieutenant, [[Lawrence Kemys]], back to Guyana in the area of the Orinoco River, to gather more information about the lake and the golden city.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guyana.org/features/guyanastory/chapter7.html "Raleigh's Second Expedition to Guiana."]&lt;/ref&gt; During his exploration of the coast between the Amazon and the Orinoco, Kemys mapped the location of Amerindian tribes and prepared geographical, geological and botanical reports of the country. Kemys described the coast of Guiana in detail in his ''Relation of the Second Voyage to Guiana'' (1596)&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Kemys, Lawrence (DNB00)|John Knox Laughton, "Kemys, Lawrence" Dictionary of National Biography, 1885–1900, Volume 30.]]&lt;/ref&gt; and says that indigenous people of Guiana traveled inland by canoe and land passages towards a large body of water on the shores of which he supposed was located Manoa, Golden City of El Dorado. One of these rivers leading south into the interior of Guiana was the [[Essequibo River|Essequibo]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ufdc.ufl.edu/UFE0041100/00001 Renzo Duin, ''Wayana Socio-Political Landscapes: Multi-Scalar Regionality and Temporality in Guiana'', doctoral dissertation, University of Florida: Gainesville; 2009.]&lt;/ref&gt; Kemys wrote that the Indians called this river "brother of the Orenoque [Orinoco]" and that this river of Essequibo, or Devoritia,

There be infinite numbers of canoas in this lake, and (as I suppose) it is no other than that, whereon Manoa standeth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;res_id=xri:eebo&amp;rft_id=xri:eebo:image:9768 Lawrence Keymis, ''A Relation of the Second Voyage to Guiana'', Theatrum Orbis Terrarum, 1596.]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Early maps==
[[File:1599 Guyana Hondius.jpg|thumb|left|''Nieuwe caerte van het Wonderbaer ende Goudrjcke Landt Guiana'' by Jodocus Hondius (1598) shows an enormous Lake Parime. Manoa is shown on the northeastern shore.

"Manoa, o el Dorado", appears on the northwestern corner of the lake.]]

As a result of Raleigh's work, maps began to appear depicting El Dorado and Lake Parime. One of the first was the elder [[Jodocus Hondius]]' ''Nieuwe Caerte van het Wonderbaer ende Goudrycke Landt Guiana'', which was published in 1598. Hondius' map depicts an elongated Lake Parime south of the Orinoco River, with the majority of the lake positioned south of the equator, and with Manoa on the northern shore, towards the eastern half of the lake. Manoa is noted as "the greatest city in the entire world". Hondius' map was subsequently copied by [[Theodore de Bry]] and published in his popular ''Grands Voyages'' in 1599.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sanderusmaps.com/en/our-catalogue/detail/160243&amp;e=antique-map-of-guiana-by-de-bry-th/ Theodore de Bry, "The map of 'the powerful and gold-bearing kingdom of Guiana", 1599.]&lt;/ref&gt; When Hondius published a completely revised edition of Mercator's Atlas in 1608,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swaen.com/antique-map-of.php?id=14384 Jodocus Hondius, "Typus Orbis Terrarum", Amsterdam, 1608.]&lt;/ref&gt; it included a map of South America featuring Lake Parime with the majority of the lake located south of the equator, and with Manoa again along the northern shore, although not quite so far east.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.washmapsociety.org/000/0/9/8/22890/userfiles/file/Lake_Parime.pdf Eliane Dotson, Lake Parime and the Golden City]".&lt;/ref&gt;

Cartographer [[Guillaume Delisle]] was among the first to cast doubts on the lake's existence. In a [http://www.geographicus.com/P/AntiqueMap/SouthAmerica-covensmortier-1730 map of Guyana printed in 1730], he included an outline of the lake, then replaced it with the notation: "It is in these regions that most authors place the Lake Parime and the City of Manoa of El Dorado."&lt;ref&gt; Original French: "C'est dans ces quartiers que la pluspart des autheurs placent le Lac de Parime et la Ville de Manoa del Dorado."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ufdc.ufl.edu/UFE0041100/00001 Renzo Duin, ''Wayana Socio-Political Landscapes: Multi-Scalar Regionality and Temporality in Guiana'' PhD dissertation, University of Florida, Gainesville, 2009; p. 70.]&lt;/ref&gt; Delisle reluctantly included a lake in southwestern Guyana on several subsequent maps, but did not name it or the city of Manoa.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.raremaps.com/gallery/enlarge/0184 Guillaume De L'Isle and Philippe Buache: ''Carte D'Amerique Dressee pour l'usage du Roy en 1722...Et augmentee desa Nouvelles Decovertes en 1763.'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The lake was printed on maps throughout the 17th and 18th centuries and up until the early 19th century. Some cartographers and naturalists moved the lake more to the southeast of the [[Orinoco River]] and north of the [[Amazon river]], often situating it south of the mountains that border [[Venezuela]], Guiana, and [[Brazil]]. However, by the late 18th century, failure to confirm the lake's existence led to its removal from most maps.&lt;ref name = "Winsor"&gt;Justin Winsor, [https://books.google.com/books?id=x0NEAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA589&amp;lpg ''Spanish Explorations and Settlements in North America from the Fifteenth to the Seventeenth Century: Volume 2 of Narrative and critical history of America''], Houghton, Mifflin, 1886; p. 589.&lt;/ref&gt; A 1792 map of the [[Branco River|Rio Branco]] by José Joaquin Freire shows no sign of a lake, although there is now a [[Parimé River]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wdl.org/en/item/816/ Jose Joaquin Freire, "Map of the Branco or Parimé River and of the Caratirimani, Uararicapará, Majari, Tacutú and Mahú Rivers," 1792]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Guiana and Caribana WDL11336.png|thumb|left|A 1650 Dutch copy of a French map by Nicolas Sanson, showing Lake Parime. "Manoa [[el Dorado]]" appears on the northwest corner of the lake. Lake Cassipa is to the north of the city.]]

In early 1611 [[Sir Thomas Roe]], on a mission to the [[West Indies]] for [[Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales]], sailed his 200-ton ship, the ''Lion's Claw'', some {{convert|320|km|mi}} up the Amazon,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?pid=S0102-01882011000100016&amp;script=sci_arttext&amp;tlng=en#nt1 Alírio Cardoso, "The conquest of Maranhão and Atlantic disputes in the geopolitics of the Iberian Union (1596–1626)," ''Rev. Bras. Hist.'' vol.31 no.61, São Paulo,  2011.]&lt;/ref&gt; then took a party of canoes up the [[Oyapock River]] in search of Lake Parime, negotiating thirty-two rapids and traveling about one hundred miles before they ran out of food and had to turn back.&lt;ref&gt;James Seay Dean, ''Tropics Bound: Elizabeth's Seadogs on the Spanish Main,'' The History Press, 2013. {{ISBN|0752496689}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/englishcoloniesi00will James Alexander Williamson, ''English colonies in Guiana and on the Amazon, 1604–1668,'' Oxford, 1923; p. 54.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Roe, Thomas (DNB00)|Stanley Lane-Poole, "Roe, Thomas"; Dictionary of National Biography, 1885–1900, Volume 49]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael J.

===Raleigh and Kemys, 1617===
In March 1617, Raleigh and Kemys returned to Venezuela in search of Lake Parime and El Dorado. The expedition failed to uncover any new evidence of the lake and ended with the death of Raleigh's son Walter and the suicide of Captain Kemys.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nndb.com/people/106/000049956/ "Sir Walter Raleigh," NNDB Database]&lt;/ref&gt;

==18th century explorations==
===Nicholas Horstman, 1739===
In November 1739, Nicholas Horstman (sometimes spelled "Hortsman"), a surgeon from [[Hildesheim|Hildesheim, Germany]] who was secretly commissioned by the Dutch Governor of Guiana (Laurens Storm van's Gravesande), traveled up the Essequibo River accompanied by two Dutch soldiers and four Indian guides.&lt;ref name = "Harris"&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/riseofbritishguiana01stor/riseofbritishguiana01stor_djvu.txt C. A. Harris and John Abraham Jacob De Villiers, ''Storm Van's Gravesande: The Rise of British Guiana, Compiled from his Works'',  Hakluyt Society, 1911; University of Michigan.]&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1741 one of the Indian guides returned reporting that in 1740 Horstman had crossed over to the Rio Branco and descended it to its confluence with the Rio Negro. Rumors at the time held that Horstman had planted the Dutch Flag on the shores of Lake Parime, however later explorers determined that he had in fact visited Lake Amucu on the [[North Rupununi]]. Nothing further was heard until late November, 1742 when the other guides returned, reporting that Horstman and one of the Dutch soldiers had spent four months in a village on the [[Pará River]], where they were discovered and arrested by the Portuguese authorities, and that they had "entered into the Portuguese service". In August 1743 [[Charles-Marie de La Condamine]] met and conversed with Horstman,&lt;ref name = "Condamine"&gt;Charles Marie de La Condamine, [https://archive.org/details/relationabrg00laco ''Relation abrégée d'un voyage fait dans l'intérieur de l'Amérique méridionale: depuis la côte de la mer du Sud, jusqu'aux côtes du Brésil et de la Guyane, en descendant la rivière des Amazones...''], Jean-Edme Dufour and Philippe Roux, 1778; University of Lausanne [French]&lt;/ref&gt; who appeared to be living freely with the Portuguese in [[Pará]], and Horstman gave him his fragmentary diary, titled "Journey which I made to the Imaginary Lake of Parima, or of Gold, in the Year 1739". Horstman states that on May 8, 1740,

{{quote|We entered the lake, in which we spent this entire day, and the next likewise, and after having passed an island, again dragging the canoe and also the cargo, we entered the great lake, called by the Indians Amucu, in which we proceeded constantly over reeds, with which the lake is entirely filled, and it has two islands in the middle...

Horstman also gave La Condamine a remarkably accurate hand-drawn map of his route from the coast through the interior of Northern Brazil.&lt;ref name = "Condamine"/&gt; La Condamine then gave the map to the French geographer [[Jean Baptiste Bourguignon d'Anville]].

===Manuel Centurion, 1740===
In 1740, Don Manuel Centurion, Governor of [[Ciudad Bolívar|Santo Tomé de Guayana de Angostura del Orinoco]] in Venezuela, hearing a report from an Indian regarding Lake Parima, embarked on a journey up the [[Caura River (Venezuela)|Caura River]] and the [[Paragua River]].&lt;ref name = "Pierce"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Td4MAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq= Edward M.

===Charles Marie de La Condamine, 1743===
Between June and September 1743 the scientist and geographer Charles de La Condamine traveled from [[Quito]] to the Atlantic coast via the [[Amazon River]], charting its course and making scientific observations. In his subsequent account of this journey, ''Abbreviated Relation of a Journey made in the Interior of South America'' (1745), Condamine discussed the existence of Lake Parime, stating that although the Indians had extracted "small flakes" of gold from the rivers, these stories had been greatly exaggerated to concoct the myth of a golden city:

{{quote|The Manaus were neighbors of a large lake, &amp; even several Great Lakes; because they are very frequent in a low country [which is] subject to flooding. The Manaus pulled gold from the [[Vaupés River|Yquiari]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=HpMmXM1OJuYC&amp;dq= ''Revista do Instituto Histórico e Geográfico Brasileiro,'' Issue 1, Instituto Histórico e Geográfico Brasileiro, 1856.] [Portuguese]&lt;/ref&gt; &amp; seized small flakes: these are real facts, which were used in exaggeration, giving rise to the fable of the city of Manoa &amp; Golden Lake. If we find that there is still a long way from the small flakes of gold of the Manaus, to the [golden] roofs of the town of Manoa, &amp; that there is nonetheless far from the glitter of this metal, ripped from the waters of the Yquiari, to the fable of Parime gold; one cannot deny that on the one hand greed &amp; concern of Europeans who wanted by any force to find what they were looking for, and on the other, clever liars &amp; exaggerating Indians [who], interested in sending away the uncomfortable visitors, might alter &amp; deface [the facts] to the point of making them unrecognizable. The history of the discoveries of the new world provides more than one example of similar metamorphoses.&lt;ref name = "Condamine"/&gt;}}

During his journey La Condamine met and conversed with Nicholas Horstman and determined that he had found Lake Amucu in approximately the location of the reputed Lake Parime. On [http://www.swaen.com/zoomV2.php?id=15856&amp;referer=antique-map-of.php the map of his own travels included in his book], La Condamine placed a small lake as a source of the [[Takutu River]], designating it only "Lac".&lt;ref name = "Condamine"/&gt;

==19th century explorations==
===Humboldt and Bonpland, 1799–1803===
[[File:Humboldt-Bonpland Chimborazo.jpg|thumb|right|Humboldt and Bonpland in Ecuador, early 1802.]]
[[Alexander von Humboldt]] and [[Aimé Bonpland]] considered Lake Amucu in the [[North Rupununi]], which had been visited by the German surgeon Nicholas Horstman, to be the Lake Parime described by Sir Walter Raleigh.&lt;ref&gt;Graham Watkins, Pete Oxford, and Reneé Bish, [http://rupununi.org/el-dorado/ "Raleigh's El Dorado"], from ''Rupununi: Rediscovering a Lost World'', ''Earth in Focus Editions, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; In his ''Relation historique du voyage aux régions équinoxiales du nouveau continent'' (1825), Humboldt indicated that Lake Amucu was in the same location as the purported Lake Parime (or Roponowini) described to Raleigh, and was also a "large inland sea" when flooded; he noted that:
{{quote|All fables have some real foundation; that of El Dorado resembles those myths of antiquity ... No man in Europe believes any longer in the wealth of Guiana and the ... town of Manoa and its palaces covered with plates of massy gold have long since disappeared; but the geographical apparatus serving to adorn the fable of El Dorado, the lake Parima, which ... reflected the image of so many sumptuous edifices, has been religiously preserved by geographers.&lt;ref name = "Humboldt"/&gt;}}

===Charles Waterton, 1812===
In 1812 [[Charles Waterton]] independently came to a similar conclusion and proposed that seasonal flooding of the [[Rupununi savannah]] could be the famed Lake Parime. Waterton wrote:
{{quote|According to the new map of South America, Lake Parima, or the White Sea, ought to be within three or four days' walk from this place. On asking the Indians whether there was such a place or not, and describing that the water was fresh and good to drink, an old Indian, who appeared to be about sixty, said that there was such a place, and that he had been there ... [but] probably the Lake Parima they talked of was the Amazons ... In crossing the plain at the most advantageous place you are above ankle-deep in water for three hours; the remainder of the way is dry, the ground gently rising. As the lower parts of this spacious plain put on somewhat the appearance of a lake during the periodical rains, it is not improbable but that this is the place which hath given rise to the supposed existence of the famed Lake Parima, or El Dorado ... On asking the old officer if there were such a place as Lake Parima, or El Dorado, he replied, he looked upon it as imaginary altogether. "I have been above forty years," added he, "in Portuguese Guiana, but have never yet met with anybody who has seen the lake. So much for Lake Parima, or El Dorado, or the White Sea. Its existence at best seems doubtful; some affirm that there is such a place, and others deny it."&lt;ref name="Waterton"&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/31811/31811-h/31811-h.htm Charles Waterton, ''Wanderings in South America,'' Cassell &amp; Co, Ltd: London, Paris &amp; Melbourne. 1891.]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Robert Schomburgk, 1840===
In 1840 explorer [[Robert Hermann Schomburgk]] visited Pirara on the edge of Lake Amucu.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Hermann Schomburgk, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1798133?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents "Sources of the Takutu in British Guiana, in the year 1842"], ''Journal of the Royal Geographical Society of London'', Vol. 13, pp 18–75, 1843&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peter Rivière, ed.

===Jacob van Heuvel, 1844===
In 1844 the American author Jacob Adrien van Heuvel, a graduate of [[Yale University|Yale]] and a law student, published an account of his travels in Guiana in which he investigated evidence for the existence of El Dorado and Lake Parima. The book described a journey to Guiana he had made in 1819–20 during which he questioned a "Charibe chief" named Mahanerwa about the existence of the lake. Mahanerwa drew a map in the sand, and stated that a large body of water lay southeast of the Orinoco. Van Heuvel superimposed this drawing onto [[John Arrowsmith (cartographer)|John Arrowsmith]]'s 1840 map of [[British Guyana]], claiming that much of this body of water, some {{convert|250|mi|km}} in length, was likely a "temporary [[flood|inundation]]" but that "water must fill the [[savanna]]h" for half the year at least and probably more. Van Heuvel considered Lake Parima and Lake Cassipa to be identical.&lt;ref&gt;Jacob Adrien Van Heuvel, [https://books.google.com/books?id=FY70hOQbVx8C&amp;dq= ''El Dorado: Being a Narrative of the Circumstances which Gave Rise to Reports, in the Sixteenth Century, of the Existence of a Rich and Splendid City in South America, to which that Name was Given, and which Led to Many Enterprises in Search of it; Including a Defence of Sir Walter Raleigh, in Regard to the Relations Made by Him Respecting It, and a Nation of Female Warriors, in the Vicinity of the Amazon, in the Narrative of His Expedition to the Oronoke in 1595''], J. Winchester, 1844.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1848 edition of Raleigh's ''The Discovery of the Large, Rich, and Beautiful Empire of Guiana,'' Schomburgk dismissed Van Heuvel's propositions:

{{quote|Mr. Van Heuvel visited the coast regions of Guiana without penetrating into the interior, and his conclusions respecting this lake rest only upon what he learned from some Indians, whose language he did not understand, and upon the maps of [[Nicolas Sanson|Sanson]], [[Jean Baptiste Bourguignon d'Anville|D'Anville]] and others of the last century; and although fully acquainted with Humboldt's writings, "who," he says, "effaced without sufficient grounds that wondrous lake," Mr. Van Heuvel has fully restored it, and gives to it a length of from two hundred to two hundred and fifty miles, and a breadth of about fifty miles. Out of it flow the rivers [[Parima River|Parima]] and [[Takutu River|Takutu]] into the [[Rio Negro (Amazon)|Rio Negro]] and the Amazon; the [[Cuyuni River|Cuyuni]], the [[Siparuni River|Siparuni]], and the [[Mazaruni River|Mazaruni]], into the Essequibo; and the [[Paragua River|Paragua]] into the Orinoco. A single step backwards in our geographical knowledge is much to be regretted, and all who take interest in that science ought to aid in preventing the dissemination of such absurdities.&lt;ref name = "Discovery"&gt;Robert H.

In spite of well-publicized evidence disproving the existence of Lake Parime, the [[Encyclopædia Britannica#1827.E2.80.931901|1853 edition]] of the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' described the lake under the entry for "America:"

==Evidence for an ancient lake==
===Nhamini-wi and the Lake of Milk===
The [[Tucano people|Tucano]] and [[Piratapuia]] tribes of the upper Rio Negro tell a story of the [[Nhamini-wi]] (the "narrow path"). The Nhamini-wi was a pre-Columbian road that traveled from the mountains in the west where the "house of the night" was located.&lt;ref name = "Maziero"/&gt; The trail began at ''axpeko-dixtara'', or the "lake of milk"{{#tag:ref|So-called because of inorganic sediments carried by the river.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amazonian-fish.co.uk/indexc30.html Comparison between white and black waters]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] mentions this peculiar coloration in [http://people.wku.edu/charles.smith/wallace/S011.htm "On the Rio Negro,"] a paper read at the 13 June 1853 meeting of the [[Royal Geographical Society]], in which he says: "[The Rio Branco] is white to a remarkable degree, its waters being actually milky in appearance." Humboldt attributed the color to the presence of [[silicate]]s in the water, principally [[mica]] and [[talc]].&lt;ref name = "Humboldt"/&gt;|group="Note"}} in the east. In 1977 artist and explorer [[Roland Stevenson]] found ruins north of the Rio Negro in the [[Vaupés River|Uaupés River]] basin that are believed to be the remnants of the Nhamini-wi.&lt;ref&gt;Roland Stevenson, ''Uma Luz nos Mistérios Amazônicos.''  Manaus: SUFRAMA, 1994. [Portuguese]&lt;/ref&gt; Led by indigenous guides Stevenson found old and collapsed stone walls that were dotted every twenty kilometers along an east-to-west line.

Stevenson followed the vestiges of the road eastward to find the lake and ended up in [[Roraima]], [[Brazil]], in the plains of [[Boa Vista, Roraima|Boa Vista]]. Upon examining the region Brazilian geologists Gert Woeltje and Frederico Guimarães Cruz along with Roland Stevenson&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.netium.com.br/parime/Parime_English.htm Roland Stevenson, "Parime: Finding the Legendary Lake."]&lt;/ref&gt; found that on all the surrounding hillsides a horizontal line appears at a uniform level approximately {{convert|120|m|ft}} above sea level.&lt;ref name = "Maziero"&gt;[http://www.arqueologiamericana.com.br/artigos/artigo_01.htm Dalton Delfini Maziero, "El Dorado Em busca dos antigos mistérios Amazônicos," ''Arqueologiamericana.''] [Portuguese]&lt;/ref&gt; This line registers the water level of an extinct lake which existed until relatively recent times. Researchers who studied it found that the lake's previous diameter measured {{convert|400|km|mi}} and its area was about {{convert|80000|km2|mi2}}. About 700 years ago this giant lake began to drain due to [[epeirogenic movement]] and by the early 19th century it had dried up.&lt;ref&gt;[https://explorers.org/pdf/SHEA_FLAG_REPORT_V35-C_013014.pdf Jeff Shea, ''The March 2013 Paragua River Expedition: Penetration into The Meseta de Ichún of Venezuela,'' Explorers Club Report #60.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Geological evidence===
Geologic research suggests that, thousands of years ago, conditions existed for the formation of a lake. [[Sedimentary rock]] in this region, known as the Takutu Basin or the [[Takutu Formation]], dates back to the late [[Paleozoic]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cprm.gov.br/publique/media/capII.pdf A. J. Pedreira et al, (2003), "Bacias Sedimentares Paleozóicas e Meso-Cenozóicas Interiores," (Paleozoic and Meso-Cenozoic Sedimentary Basins) in ''Geologia, Tectônica e Recursos Minerais do Brasil.'' A. Bizzi, C. Schobbenhaus, R. M. Vidotti e J. H. Gonçalves (eds.) CPRM, Brasília, 2003.] [Portuguese]&lt;/ref&gt; roughly 250 million years ago, and the basin connected with the Atlantic via the Takutu [[Graben]].&lt;ref&gt;C. D. Frailey et al, "A proposed Pleistocene/Holocene lake in the Amazon Basin and its significance to Amazonian geology and biogeography." ''Acta Amazonica'', vol. 18, p. 119-143, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; The geologic history of the Takutu Graben is characterized by one phase of volcanic activity and three [[Deposition (geology)|depositional]] phases of sedimentary rocks. [[Rifting]] (due to divergent [[tectonic plate]] movements) occurred in ''a lake or [[River delta|delta]] environment'' in the Late [[Triassic]] to Early [[Jurassic]] periods, between 200 million and one hundred and fifty million years ago.&lt;ref&gt;[http://guyanachronicle.com/earth-matters-13/ "The Takutu Graben," ''The Guyana Chronicle Online,'' June 2, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; Starting around 66,000 years ago, sea level rise and more humid conditions created flooded zones north of the confluence of the Rio Negro and the [[Solimões River]], in what is now Roraima.&lt;ref&gt;Emilio Alberto Amaral Soares, "Depósitos pleistocenos da região de confluência dos rios Negro e Solimões, Amazonas," Doctoral thesis, University of São Paulo, Institute of Geosciences, 2007. [Portuguese]&lt;/ref&gt;

Seasonal flooding was probably misidentified as a lake by some observers. The drainage system of the Rupununi Savannahs is unable to carry a high volume of [[surface runoff]] and as a result, most rivers flood in the [[wet season]]. In a few places [[ground water]] drainage is impeded by clay, and ponds and lakes persist for several months.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guianashield.org/index.php/publications-home/doc_view/149-preliminary-analysis-largescale-forest-inventory-data Hans ter Steege, Gerold Zondervan, "A Preliminary Analysis of Large-Scale Forest Inventory Data of the Guiana Shield," unpublished research.]&lt;/ref&gt;

An additional theory is that Lake Parime did actually exist, and was drained abruptly in June 1690 when an intensity [[Mercalli intensity scale|IX (''Violent'')]] earthquake opened a bedrock [[Fault (geology)|fault]], forming a [[rift]] or a graben that permitted the water to flow into the Rio Branco.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?pid=S0001-37652014000301115&amp;script=sci_arttext Alberto V.

[[Image:Military Laser rangefinder LRB20000.jpg|thumb|A long range laser rangefinder is capable of measuring distance up to 20 km; mounted on a tripod with an angular mount. The resulting system also provides [[azimuth]] and [[elevation]] measurements.]]A '''laser rangefinder''' is a [[rangefinder]] that uses a [[laser]] beam to determine the [[distance]] to an object. The most common form of laser rangefinder operates on the [[time of flight]] principle by sending a laser pulse in a narrow beam towards the object and measuring the [[time]] taken by the pulse to be reflected off the target and returned to the sender. Due to the high [[speed of light]], this technique is not appropriate for high precision sub-millimeter measurements, where [[triangulation]] and other techniques are often used.

==Pulse==

The pulse may be coded to reduce the chance that the rangefinder can be [[Electronic countermeasures|jammed]]. It is possible to use [[Doppler effect]] techniques to judge whether the object is moving towards or away from the rangefinder, and if so, how fast.

==Precision==

The precision of the instrument is determined by the [[Rise time|rise or fall time]] of the laser pulse and the speed of the receiver. One that uses very sharp laser pulses and has a very fast detector can range an object to within a few millimeters.

==Range and range error==

Despite the [[Light beam|beam]] being narrow, it will eventually spread over long distances due to the [[Beam divergence|divergence]] of the laser beam, as well as due to scintillation and beam wander effects, caused by the presence of air bubbles in the air acting as lenses ranging in size from microscopic to roughly half the height of the laser beam's path above the earth.

These atmospheric [[distortions]] coupled with the divergence of the laser itself and with transverse winds that serve to push the [[atmospheric]] heat bubbles laterally may combine to make it difficult to get an accurate reading of the distance of an object, say, beneath some trees or behind bushes, or even over long distances of more than 1&amp;nbsp;km in open and unobscured desert terrain.

Some of the laser light might reflect off leaves or branches which are closer than the object, giving an early return and a reading which is too low. Alternatively, over distances longer than 1200&amp;nbsp;ft (365 m), the target, if in proximity to the earth, may simply vanish into a [[mirage]], caused by temperature [[gradients]] in the air in proximity to the heated surface bending the laser light. All these effects have to be taken into account.

==Calculation==

The distance between point A and B is given by
:&lt;math&gt;D=\frac{ct}{2}&lt;/math&gt;
where ''c'' is the speed of light and ''t'' is the amount of time for the round-trip between A and B.

:&lt;math&gt;t=\frac{\varphi}{\omega}&lt;/math&gt;
where ''φ'' is the phase delay made by the light traveling and ''ω'' is the angular frequency of optical wave.

Then substituting the values in the equation,

:&lt;math&gt;D=\frac{1}{2} ct = \frac{1}{2} \frac{c \varphi}{\omega} = \frac{c}{4 \pi f}  (N \pi + \Delta \varphi) = \frac{\lambda}{4}(N+ \Delta N)&lt;/math&gt;

In this equation, ''λ'' is the wavelength ''c/f''; ''Δφ'' is the part of the phase delay that does not fulfill ''π'' (that is, ''φ'' modulo ''π''); ''N'' is the integer number of wave half-cycles of the round-trip and Δ''N'' the remaining fractional part.

==Technologies==
[[File:Su-27UB cockpit.jpg|thumb|An OLS-27 [[IRST]] with laser rangefinder on the [[Sukhoi Su-27]]]]
'''[[Time of flight]]''' - this measures the time taken for a light pulse to travel to the target and back. With the speed of light known, and an accurate measurement of the time taken, the distance can be calculated. Many pulses are fired sequentially and the average response is most commonly used. This technique requires very accurate sub-[[nanosecond]] timing circuitry.

'''Multiple frequency phase-shift''' - this measures the phase shift of multiple frequencies on reflection then solves some simultaneous equations to give a final measure.

'''[[Interferometry]]''' - the most accurate and most useful technique for measuring changes in distance rather than absolute distances.

==Applications==

===Military===

[[Rangefinders]] provide an exact distance to targets located beyond the distance of [[Point-blank range|point-blank]] shooting to snipers and artillery. They can also be used for military reconciliation and engineering.

Handheld military rangefinders operate at ranges of 2&amp;nbsp;km up to 25&amp;nbsp;km and are combined with [[binoculars]] or [[monocular]]s. When the rangefinder is equipped with a digital magnetic compass (DMC) and inclinometer it is capable of providing magnetic azimuth, inclination, and height (length) of targets. Some rangefinders can also measure a target's speed in relation to the observer. Some rangefinders have cable or wireless interfaces to enable them to transfer their measurement(s) data to other equipment like fire control computers. Some models also offer the possibility to use add-on [[night vision]] modules. Most handheld rangefinders use standard or rechargeable  batteries.

[[Image:AI AWSM .338 Lap. Mag. Dutch ISAF sniper team.jpg|thumb|left|A Dutch [[International Security Assistance Force|ISAF]] sniper team displaying their [[Accuracy International AWM|Accuracy International AWSM]] .338 Lapua Magnum rifle and VECTOR IV&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://rangefindertoday.com/rangefinder/|title=Military Laser rangefinders|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leica/Vectronix laser rangefinder binoculars]]
The more powerful models of rangefinders measure distance up to 25&amp;nbsp;km and are normally installed either on a tripod or directly on a vehicle or gun platform. In the latter case the rangefinder module is integrated with on-board thermal, night vision and daytime observation equipment. The most advanced military rangefinders can be integrated with computers.

To make laser rangefinders and [[laser-guided]] weapons less useful against military targets, various military arms may have developed laser-absorbing paint for their vehicles. Regardless, some objects don't reflect laser light very well and using a laser rangefinder on them is difficult.

===3-D modeling===
[[Image:Lidar P1270901.jpg|thumb|This [[LIDAR]] scanner may be used to scan buildings, rock formations, etc., to produce a 3D model. The LIDAR can aim its laser beam in a wide range: its head rotates horizontally, a mirror flips vertically. The laser beam is used to measure the distance to the first object on its path.]]

Laser rangefinders are used extensively in 3-D object recognition, 3-D object modelling, and a wide variety of [[computer vision]]-related fields. This technology constitutes the heart of the so-called ''time-of-flight'' [[3D scanner]]s. In contrast to the military instruments described above, laser rangefinders offer high-precision scanning abilities, with either single-face or 360-degree scanning modes.

A number of algorithms have been developed to merge the range data retrieved from multiple angles of a single object to produce complete 3-D models with as little error as possible. One of the advantages that laser rangefinders offer over other methods of computer vision is that the computer does not need to correlate features from two images to determine depth information as in [[stereoscopic]] methods.

Laser rangefinders used in computer vision applications often have depth resolutions of tenths of millimeters or less. This can be achieved by using triangulation or refraction measurement techniques as opposed to the time of flight techniques used in [[LIDAR]].

===Forestry===
[[File:Field-Map birdie.jpg|thumb|Laser rangefinder TruPulse used for forest inventories (in combination with [[Field-Map]] technology)]]

Special laser rangefinders are used in [[forestry]]. These devices have anti-leaf filters and work with [[Retroreflector|reflector]]s. Laser beam reflects only from this reflector and so exact distance measurement is guaranteed. Laser rangefinders with anti-leaf filter are used for example for [[Forest inventory|forest inventories]].

===Sports===
Laser rangefinders may be effectively used in various sports that require precision distance measurement, such as [[golf]], [[hunting]], and [[archery]].  Some of the more popular manufacturers are Caddytalk, Opti-logic Corporation, Bushnell, Leupold, LaserTechnology, Trimble, Leica, Newcon Optik, Op. Electronics, [[Nikon]], and Swarovski Optik.
Many rangefinders from Bushnell come with advanced features, such as ARC (angle range compensation), multi-distance ability, slope, JOLT (Vibrate when the target is locked), and Pin-Seeking. ARC Can be calculated by hand using the [[rifleman's rule]], but it's usually much easier if you let a rangefinder do it when you are out hunting. In golfing where time is most important, a laser rangefinder comes useful in locating distance to the flag. Many hunters in the eastern U.S. don't need a rangefinder, although many western hunters need them, due to longer shooting distances and more open spaces.

===Industrial production processes===
An important application is the use of laser rangefinder technology during the automation of stock management systems and production processes in steel industry.

===Laser measuring tools===
[[File:Bosch GLM 50 C.jpg|thumb|Laser rangefinder: Bosch GLM 50 C]]

Laser rangefinders are also used in several industries like construction, renovation and real estate as an alternative to a [[tape measure]], and was first introduced by [[Leica Geosystems]] in 1993 in [[France]].  To measure a large object like a room with a tape measure, one would need another person to hold the tape at the far wall and a clear line straight across the room to stretch the tape.  With a laser measuring tool, the job can be completed by one operator with just a line of sight. Although the tape measure is typically more accurate, laser measuring tools can be calibrated to be generally reliable when taking several measurements. Laser measuring tools typically include the ability to produce some simple calculations, such as the [[area]] or [[volume]] of a room, as well as switch between imperial and metric units. These units can be found in a hardware stores and online marketplaces.

==Price==
Laser rangefinders can vary in price, depending on the quality and application of the product. Military grade rangefinders need to be as accurate as possible and must also reach great distances. This could be in excess of hundreds of thousands of dollars. In other civilian applications, such as hunting or golf, they are more affordable and much more readily accessible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.criticalgolf.com/laser-rangefinder-cost-price/|title=Laser Rangefinder Cost|last=|first=|date=|work=OpticsPlanet|access-date=2017-04-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Safety==
Laser rangefinders are divided into four classes and several subclasses. Laser rangefinders available to consumers are usually laser [[Laser safety#Class 1|class 1]] or [[Laser safety#Class 2|class 2]] devices and are considered relatively eye-safe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rli.com/resources/articles/classification.aspx|title=Laser Standards and Classifications|website=www.rli.com|access-date=2017-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless of the safety rating, direct eye contact should always be avoided. Most laser rangefinders for military use exceed the laser class 2 energy levels.

''[[Ratatouille (film)|Ratatouille]]'' is a [[computer-animated]] [[film]] produced by [[Pixar]] and distributed by [[Walt Disney Pictures]]. The film was released on June 29, 2007 in the United States as the eighth film produced by Pixar. It was directed by [[Brad Bird]], who took over from [[Jan Pinkava]] in 2005. The plot follows Remy, a rat who dreams of becoming a chef and tries to achieve his goal by forming an alliance with a [[Paris]]ian restaurant's garbage boy. ''Ratatouille'' was released to both critical acclaim and box office success, opening in 3,940 theaters domestically and debuting at #1 with $47&amp;nbsp;million,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Pamela McClintock |title=Audiences chow down on "Ratatouille" |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=July 1, 2007 |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117967918.html?categoryid=13&amp;cs=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; grossing $206,445,654 in North America and a total of $624,445,654 worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/series/Pixar.php |title=Pixar Box Office History |accessdate=January 13, 2008 |publisher=The Numbers}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film is on the 2007 top ten lists of multiple critics, including Michael Sragow of ''[[The Baltimore Sun]]'' as number one, A.O.

This is a '''list of post-nominal letters used in Canada'''. The order in which they follow an individual's name is: 1. Distinctions conferred directly by the Crown; 2. University degrees: 3.
Memberships of societies and other distinctions. Normally no more than two are given, representing the highest award of each type.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.btb.termiumplus.gc.ca/tcdnstyl-chap?lang=eng&amp;lettr=chapsect1&amp;info0=1.08#zz1|title=1.08 University degrees, professional designations, military decorations, honours, awards and memberships|work=The Canadian Style|accessdate=26 March 2017|date=2017|publisher= Public Works and Government Services Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt; For decorations and medals, the order of precedence is the same as the [[Canadian order of precedence (decorations and medals)|order of precedence for the wearing of order insignias, decorations, and medals]], as laid out by the [[Department of Canadian Heritage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gg.ca/document.aspx?id=14979|title=Order of Precedence|publisher=[[Governor General of Canada]]|accessdate=26 March 2017|date=9 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

| '''VC''' || [[Victoria Cross (Canada)|Victoria Cross]] || Currently there are no living Canadians permitted to use the post-nominal letters ''VC''. Since its creation in 1993, the [[Victoria Cross (Canada)|Canadian Victoria Cross]] has never been awarded.

The post-nominal letters are necessary to denote that someone is a privy councillor because in Canada holding a certain office can also allow the use of ''The Honourable'' title. Unlike what is done in the United Kingdom, the post-nominals "PC" have precedence over all Crown honours with two notable exceptions: the Victoria Cross ("VC") and the Cross of Valour ("CV").&lt;ref name=GWODM&gt;{{citation| last=The Chancellery of Honours, Rideau Hall| title=Guide for the Wearing of Orders, Decorations and Medals| pages=23| publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada| url=https://www.gg.ca/pdf/Honours%20Wearing%20Guide%202013E_web.pdf| accessdate=1 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In practice, post-nominals are not usually translated from one language to another, but this is an exception.

==British post-nominals used alongside Canadian ones==
Any person who, prior to 1 June 1972, was a member of a British order or the recipient of a British decoration or medal may use the post-nominal letters for the decoration or medal together with those of any Canadian order, decoration or medal.

Canadians can still be awarded British medals, as well as those from other countries, but this must first be approved by the [[Government of Canada]]. (See [[Nickle Resolution]])

The film would be the first theatrical animated feature-length film of Disney. It was planned to be a [[Films with live action and animation|combination of animation with live-action]]. [[Mary Pickford]] was attached to star as [[Alice (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Alice]].&lt;ref&gt;''Alice in Wonderland: 50th Universary Edition'', 2005 DVD&lt;/ref&gt; However, the project was scrapped in favor of ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]''.

During the development of the cartoon, the kangaroo was dropped in favor of an ostrich. At one time, Mickey was supposed to help Donald with the ostrich, before he was omitted from the plot altogether in favor of the duck. The original kangaroo elements ended up in "[[Mickey's Kangaroo]]," which was released in 1935, minus the train station.

The magic act is followed by a [[grand opera]], featuring Mickey, Donald, [[Clara Cluck]], and Pluto, and exposing the hat again. During the development, this was split into two cartoons, since the plot was considered too thick for a standard short, and it became "Mickey's Magic Hat". During the development of the former short, Donald was downgraded from Mickey's helper to a frustrated spectator role. It was released in 1937 as "Magician Mickey". Somewhere during the development after the split, "Mickey's Grand Opera" was produced first and kept most of the original elements, and it was released in 1936.&lt;ref name=DavidGerstein/&gt;

{{History of the Philippines}}

The '''Manila Galleons''' ({{lang-es|Galeón de Manila}}; {{lang-fil|Kalakalang Galyon ng Maynila at Acapulco}}) were [[Spain|Spanish]] trading [[sailing ship|ship]]s which for two and a half centuries linked the [[Philippines]] with [[Mexico]] across the [[Pacific Ocean]], making one or two round-trip voyages per year between the ports of [[Acapulco]] and [[Manila]], which were both part of [[New Spain]]. The name of the [[galleon]] changed to reflect the city that the ship sailed from.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Williams, Glyn |year=1999 |title=The Prize of All the Oceans |publisher=Viking |location=New York |isbn=0-670-89197-5 |page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''Manila Galleons'' is also used to refer to the trade route itself between Acapulco and Manila, which lasted from 1565 to 1815.

The Manila Galleons were also known in New Spain as "La Nao de la China" (The China Ship) because it carried largely Chinese goods, shipped from Manila.&lt;ref&gt;[[:es:Nao#La nao de China|La Nao de China]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Manila Galleon trade route was inaugurated in 1565 after Augustinian friar and navigator [[Andrés de Urdaneta]] discovered the ''tornaviaje'' or return route from the Philippines to Mexico. The first successful round trips were made by Urdaneta and by [[Alonso de Arellano]] that year. The route lasted until 1815 when the [[Mexican War of Independence]] broke out. The Manila galleons sailed the Pacific for 250 years, bringing to the Americas cargoes of luxury goods such as spices and porcelain, in exchange for silver. The route also created a cultural exchange that shaped the identities and culture of the countries involved.

In 2015, the Philippines and Mexico began preparations for the nomination of the Manila-Acapulco Galleon Trade Route in the [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage List]], with backing from Spain. Spain has also suggested the tri-national nomination of the Archives on the Manila-Acapulco Galleons in the [[UNESCO]] [[Memory of the World Register]].

==Discovery of the route==
[[File:Urdaneta marinela txikia.jpg|thumb|left|upright|left|Explorer Andrés de Urdaneta]]
[[File:Puerto_de_Acapulco_Boot_1628.png|thumb|left|[[Acapulco]] in 1628, Mexican terminus of the Manila galleon]]
In 1521, a Spanish expedition led by [[Ferdinand Magellan]] sailed west across the Pacific using the westward [[trade winds]]. The expedition discovered the [[Mariana Islands]] and the [[Philippines]] and claimed them for Spain. Although Magellan died there, one of his ships made it back to Spain by continuing westward.

In order to settle and trade with these islands from the Americas, an eastward maritime return path was necessary. [[Trinidad (ship)|The first ship to try this]] a few years later failed. In 1529, [[Álvaro de Saavedra Cerón]] also tried sailing east from the Philippines, but could not find the eastward winds across the Pacific. In 1543, [[Bernardo de la Torre]] also failed. In 1542, however, [[Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo]] helped pave the way by sailing north from Mexico to explore the Pacific coast, reaching as far north as the [[Russian River (California)|Russian River]], just north of the [[38th parallel north|38th parallel]].

The Manila-Acapulco galleon trade finally began when Spanish navigators [[Alonso de Arellano]] and [[Andrés de Urdaneta]] discovered the eastward return route in 1565. Sailing as part of the expedition commanded by [[Miguel López de Legazpi]] to conquer the Philippines in 1565, Arellano and Urdaneta were given the task of finding a return route. Reasoning that the [[trade winds]] of the Pacific might move in a [[gyre]] as the Atlantic winds did, they had to sail north to the [[38th parallel north]], off the east coast of Japan, before catching the eastward-blowing winds ("[[westerlies]]") that would take them back across the Pacific.

Reaching the [[History of the west coast of North America|west coast of North America]], Urdaneta's ship the ''San Pedro'' hit the coast near [[Cape Mendocino]], [[California]], then followed the coast south to [[San Blas, Nayarit|San Blas]] and later to [[Acapulco]], arriving on October 8, 1565.&lt;ref name="pg18"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0Z26YL407SkC&amp;pg=PA152 |author=Derek Hayes|title=Historical atlas of the North Pacific Ocean: maps of discovery and scientific exploration, 1500–2000|page=18|publisher=Douglas &amp; McIntyre|year=2001|isbn=9781550548655}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of his crew died on the long initial voyage, for which they had not sufficiently provisioned. Arellano, who had taken a more southerly route, had already arrived.

The English privateer [[Francis Drake]] also reached the California coast, in 1579. After capturing a Spanish ship heading for Manila, Drake turned north, hoping to meet another Spanish treasure ship coming south on its return from Manila to Acapulco. He failed in that regard, but staked an English claim somewhere on the northern California coast. Although the ship's log and other records were lost, the officially accepted location is now called [[Drakes Bay]], on [[Point Reyes]] south of Cape Mendocino.{{efn|The Drakes Cove site began its review by the National Park Service (NPS) in 1994,&lt;ref name="nps.gov"&gt;[http://www.nps.gov/nhl/Fall11Noms/DrakesBayES.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; thus starting an 18-year study of the suggested Drake sites. The first formal Nomination to mark the Nova Albion site at Drake's Cove as a National Historic Landmark was provided to NPS on January 1, 1996. As part of its review, NPS obtained independent, confidential comments from professional historians. The NPS staff concluded that the Drake's Cove site is the "most probable"&lt;ref name="nps.gov" /&gt; and "most likely"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nps.gov/nhl/Fall11Noms/RedactedDrakesBay.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.winepi.com/NHLDrakesBay9-8-11.doc]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.winepi.com/NHLAppendices9-8-11.doc]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.winepi.com/NHLAppendices9-8-11a.doc]&lt;/ref&gt; Drake landing site. The National Park System Advisory Board Landmarks Committee sought public comments on the Port of Nova Albion Historic and Archaeological District Nomination &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2011/09/08/2011-22904/landmarks-committee-of-the-national-park-system-advisory-board-meeting#h-9]&lt;/ref&gt; and received more than two dozen letters of support and none in opposition.  At the Committee's meeting of November 9, 2011 in Washington, DC, representatives of the government of Spain, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and Congresswoman Lynn Wolsey all spoke in favor of the nomination:  there was no opposition.  Staff and the Drake Navigators Guild’s president, Edward Von der Porten, gave the presentation. The Nomination was strongly endorsed by Committee Member Dr. James M. Allan, Archaeologist, and the Committee as a whole which approved the nomination unanimously. The National Park System Advisory Board sought further public comments on the Nomination,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2011-09-29/html/2011-25046.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; but no additional comments were received. At the Board's meeting on December 1, 2011 in Florida, the Nomination was further reviewed: the Board approved the nomination unanimously. On October 16, 2012 Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar signed the nomination and on October 17, 2012, The Drakes Bay Historic and Archaeological District was formally announced as a new National Historic Landmark.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.doi.gov/news/pressreleases/Interior-Designates-27-New-National-Landmarks.cfm]&lt;/ref&gt;}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The Drake Navigators Guild Press Release | url=http://www.winepi.com/DNG8.htm | accessdate=February 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Andres Urdaneta Tornaviaje.jpg|thumb|Northerly trade route as used by eastbound Manila galleons]]

By the 18th century, it was understood that a less northerly track was sufficient when nearing the North American coast, and galleon navigators steered well clear of the rocky and often fogbound northern and central California coast. According to historian William Lytle Schurz, "They generally made their landfall well down the coast, somewhere between [[Point Conception]] and [[Cabo San Lucas|Cape San Lucas]]&amp;nbsp;... After all, these were preeminently merchant ships, and the business of exploration lay outside their field, though chance discoveries were welcomed".&lt;ref name=Schurz1917&gt;Schurz 1917, p.107-108&lt;/ref&gt;

The first motivation for land exploration of present-day California was to scout out possible way-stations for the seaworn Manila galleons on the last leg of their journey. Early proposals came to little, but in 1769, the [[Portola expedition]] established [[Alta California]] ports at [[San Diego, California|San Diego]] and [[Monterey, California|Monterey]], providing safe harbors for returning Manila galleons.

In Manila, the safety of ocean crossings was commended to the virgin [[Nuestra Señora de la Soledad de Porta Vaga]] in masses held by the Archbishop of Manila. If the expedition was successful the voyagers would go to the La Ermita (church) to pay homage, and offer gold and other precious gems or jewelries from Hispanic countries, to the image of the virgin. So it came to be that the Virgin was named the "Queen of the Galleons".

==Spice trade==
[[Image:16th century Portuguese Spanish trade routes.png|thumb|right|upright=1.3|White represents the route of the Manila Galleons in the Pacific and the [[Spanish treasure fleet|flota]] in the Atlantic. (Blue represents [[Portuguese India Armadas|Portuguese routes.)]]]]

Trade with [[Ming Dynasty|Ming China]] via Manila served a major source of revenue for the [[Spanish Empire]] and as a fundamental source of income for Spanish colonists in the Philippine Islands. Until 1593, two or more ships would set sail annually from each port.&lt;ref&gt;Schurz, William Lytle. ''The Manila Galleon'', 1939. P 193.&lt;/ref&gt; The Manila trade became so lucrative that [[Seville]] merchants petitioned king [[Philip II of Spain]] to protect the monopoly of the [[Casa de Contratación]] based in Seville. This led to the passing of a decree in 1593 that set a limit of two ships sailing each year from either port, with one kept in reserve in Acapulco and one in Manila. An "armada" or armed escort of galleons, was also approved. Due to official attempts at controlling the galleon trade, contraband and understating of ships' cargo became widespread.&lt;ref name="CharlesMann"&gt;{{citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IqaMEWNvsJQC|title=1493: Uncovering the New World Columbus Created|pages=123–163|author=[[Charles C. Mann]]|publisher=Random House Digital|year=2011|isbn=9780307596727}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1609 and 1616, 9 galleons and 6 galleys were constructed in Philippine shipyards. The average cost was 78,000 pesos per galleon and at least 2,000 trees. The galleons constructed included the ''San Juan Bautista'', ''San Marcos'', ''Nuestra Senora de Guadalupe'', ''Angel de la Guardia'', ''San Felipe'', ''Santiago'', ''Salbador'', ''Espiritu Santo'', and ''San Miguel''. "From 1729 to 1739, the main purpose of the [[Cavite]] shipyard was the construction and outfitting of the galleons for the Manila to Acapulco trade run."&lt;ref name=Fish&gt;{{Cite book |last=Fish |first=Shirley |title=The Manila-Acapulco Galleons: The Treasure Ships of the Pacific |publisher=AuthorHouse |year=2011 |isbn=9781456775421 |pages=128–130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the route's high profitability but long voyage time, it was essential to build the largest possible galleons, which were the largest class of ships known to have been built.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Chinese treasure ship]] for Chinese vessels that might have been larger.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 16th century, they averaged from 1,700 to 2,000 tons, were built of Philippine hardwoods and could carry 300 - 500 passengers. The ''Concepción'', wrecked in 1638, was {{convert|43|to|49|m|ft|abbr=on}} long and displacing some 2,000 tons. The [[Spanish ship Santísima Trinidad (1751)|''Santísima Trinidad'']] was 51.5 m long. Most of the ships were built in the Philippines and only eight in Mexico. The Manila-Acapulco galleon trade ended in 1815, a few years before Mexico gained independence from Spain in 1821. After this, the Spanish Crown took direct control of the Philippines, and governed directly from Madrid. This became manageable in the mid-19th century upon the invention of steam power ships and the opening of the [[Suez Canal]], which reduced the travel time from Spain to the Philippines to 40 days.

The galleon trade was supplied by merchants largely from port areas of [[Fujian]] who traveled to Manila to sell the Spaniards spices, [[porcelain]], [[ivory]], [[lacquerware]], processed [[silk]] cloth and other valuable commodities. Galleons transported the goods to be sold in the Americas, namely in [[Viceroyalty of New Spain|New Spain]] and [[Viceroyalty of Peru|Peru]] as well as in European markets. [[East Asia]] trading primarily functioned on a [[silver standard]] due to Ming China's use of [[sycee|silver ingots]] as a medium of exchange. As such, goods were mostly bought by silver mined from Mexico and [[Potosí]].&lt;ref name="CharlesMann" /&gt; In addition, [[Slavery in the Spanish New World colonies|slaves]] from various origins were transported from Manila.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Tatiana Seijas|title=Asian Slaves in Colonial Mexico: From Chinos to Indians|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d-DGAwAAQBAJ|date=23 June 2014|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-95285-9}}&lt;br/&gt;{{cite web |url=https://15minutehistory.org/2016/01/13/episode-76-the-trans-pacific-slave-trade/ |title=Episode 76: The Trans-Pacific Slave Trade |last1=Rose |first1=Christopher |date=13 January 2016 |website=15 Minute History |publisher=University of Texas at Austin |access-date=13 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cargoes arrived in Acapulco and were transported by land across Mexico to the port of [[Veracruz (city)|Veracruz]] on the [[Gulf of Mexico]], where they were loaded onto the [[Spanish treasure fleet]] bound for Spain. This route was the alternative to the trip west across the [[Indian Ocean]], and around the [[Cape of Good Hope]], which was reserved to Portugal according to the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]]. It also avoided stopping over at ports controlled by competing powers, such as Portugal and the Netherlands. From the early days of exploration, the Spanish knew that the American continent was much narrower across the [[Geography of Panama|Panamanian isthmus]] than across Mexico. They tried to establish a regular land crossing there, but the thick jungle and [[malaria]] made it impractical.

It took at least four months to sail across the [[Pacific Ocean]] from Manila to Acapulco, and the galleons were the main link between the Philippines and the viceregal capital at [[Mexico City]] and thence to Spain itself. Many of the so-called "Kastilas" or Spaniards in the Philippines were actually of Mexican descent, and the Hispanic culture of the Philippines is somewhat close to Mexican culture.&lt;ref&gt;Guevarra, Rudy P. (2007). ''Mexipino: A History of Multiethnic Identity and the Formation of the Mexican and Filipino Communities of San Diego, 1900–1965''. University of California, Santa Barbara. {{ISBN|0549122869}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even after the galleon era, and at the time when Mexico finally gained its independence, the two nations still continued to trade, except for a brief lull during the [[Spanish–American War]].

The wrecks of the Manila galleons are legends second only to the wrecks of [[Spanish treasure fleet|treasure ships]] in the Caribbean. In 1568, Miguel López de Legazpi's own ship, the ''San Pablo'' (300 tons), was the first Manila galleon to be wrecked en route to Mexico. Between the years 1576 when the ''Espiritu Santo'' was lost and 1798 when the ''San Cristobal (2)'' was lost there were twenty Manila galleons&lt;ref&gt;http://shipwrecks-Philippines.com&lt;/ref&gt; wrecked within the Philippine archipelago.

Between 1565 and 1815 Spain owned 108 galleons, of which 26 were lost at sea for various reasons. Significant galleon captures by the British occurred in 1587 when the ''Santa Anna'' was captured by [[Thomas Cavendish]], in 1709 with the ''Encarnacion'', in 1743 when the ''Nuestra Senora de la Covadonga'' was taken by [[George Anson, 1st Baron Anson|George Anson]] on his [[George Anson's voyage around the world|voyage around the world]], and in 1762 with the ''[[Spanish ship Santisima Trinidad (1751)|Nuestra Senora de la Santisima Trinidad]]''. Until 1593, four galleons travelled at the same time, later only two.&lt;ref name=Fish/&gt;{{rp|492}}

==Possible discovery of Hawaii==
{{further|Filipinos in Hawaii|Paniolo}}
For 250 years, hundreds of Manila galleons traveled from present-day Mexico to the Philippines, with their route taking them south of the [[Hawaiian Islands]]. And yet, no historical records of any contact between the two cultures exist. British historian [[Henry Kamen]] maintains that the Spanish did not have the ability to properly explore the Pacific Ocean, and were not capable of finding the islands which lay at a latitude 20° north of the westbound galleon route and its currents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Kamen| first = Henry| authorlink = Henry Kamen| title = Empire: How Spain Became a World Power, 1492–1763| publisher = [[HarperCollins]]| year = 2004| isbn = 0060932643}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Spanish activity in the Pacific was paramount until the late 18th century. [[Andrés de Urdaneta]] was the first to sail the Pacific from west to east, establishing the maritime route from Asia to America in 1565, which lasted until 1815. Spanish expeditions discovered [[Guam]], the [[Marianas]], the [[Caroline Islands|Carolines]] and the Philippines in the North Pacific, as well as [[Tuvalu]], the [[Marquesas Islands|Marquesas]], the [[Solomon Islands]] and [[New Guinea]] in the South Pacific. Spanish navigators also discovered the [[Pitcairn Islands|Pitcairn]] and [[Vanuatu]] archipelagos during their search for [[Terra Australis]] in the 17th century.

This navigational activity poses questions as to whether Spanish explorers did arrive in the Hawaiian Islands two centuries before Captain [[James Cook]]'s first visit in 1778. [[Ruy López de Villalobos]] commanded a fleet of six ships that left Acapulco in 1542 with a Spanish sailor named Ivan Gaetan or Juan Gaetano aboard as pilot. Depending on the interpretation, Gaetano's reports seem to describe either the discovery of Hawaii or the Marshall Islands in 1555.&lt;ref name=Kane&gt;{{cite book| last = Kane| first = Herb Kawainui| authorlink = Herb Kawainui Kane| editor = Bob Dye| chapter = The Manila Galleons| title = Hawaiʻ Chronicles: Island History from the Pages of Honolulu Magazine| volume = I| publisher = [[University of Hawaii Press]]| year = 1996| location = Honolulu| pages = 25–32| isbn = 0-8248-1829-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; If it was Hawaii, Gaetano would have been one of the first Europeans to find the islands.

[[File:Mauna Kea carte.JPG|thumb|300px|left|Pacific Ocean with [[Mauna Kea]] highlighted]]
After 1565, Urdaneta's new route allowed Manila galleons to sail regularly between Mexico and the Philippines for two and a half centuries, ending in 1815. The westward route from Mexico passed south of Hawaii, making a short stopover in Guam before heading for Manila. The exact route was kept secret to protect the Spanish trade monopoly against competing powers, and to avoid Dutch and English pirates. Due to this policy of discretion, if the Spanish did find Hawaii during their voyages, they would not have published their findings and the discovery would have remained unknown. From Gaetano's account, the Hawaiian islands were not known to have any valuable resources, so the Spanish would not have made an effort to settle them.&lt;ref name=Kane /&gt; This happened in the case of the Marianas and the Carolines, which were not effectively settled until the second half of the 17th century. Spanish archives{{when|date=March 2017}} contain a chart that depicts islands in the latitude of Hawaii but with the longitude ten degrees east of the Islands ([[longitude problem|reliable methods of determining longitude]] were not developed until the mid-eighteenth century). In this manuscript, the Island of [[Maui]] is named "La Desgraciada" (the unhappy, or unfortunate), and what appears to be the Island of [[Hawaii (island)|Hawaii]] is named "La Mesa" (the table). Islands resembling [[Kahoolawe]], [[Lanai]], and [[Molokai]] are named "Los Monjes" (the monks).&lt;ref&gt;Hawaii National Park. (June 1959). "[http://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/hawaii-notes/vol6-59h.htm Hawaii Nature Notes]". The Publication of the Naturalist Division, Hawaii National Park, and the Hawaii Natural History Association.&lt;/ref&gt;

The theory that Hawaii was discovered by the Spanish is reinforced by the findings of [[William Ellis (missionary)|William Ellis]], a writer and missionary who lived in early 19th century Hawaii, and recorded several folk stories about foreigners who had visited Hawaii prior to first contact with Cook. According to Hawaiian writer [[Herb Kawainui Kane]], one of these stories:
&lt;blockquote&gt;concerned seven foreigners who landed eight generations earlier at [[Kealakekua Bay]] in a painted boat with an awning or canopy over the stern. They were dressed in clothing of white and yellow, and one wore a sword at his side and a feather in his hat. On landing, they kneeled down in prayer. The [[Hawaiians]], most helpful to those who were most helpless, received them kindly. The strangers ultimately married into the families of chiefs, but their names could not be included in genealogies".&lt;ref name=Kane /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Some scholars, particularly American, have dismissed these claims as lacking credibility.&lt;ref&gt;By Oliver, Douglas L. (1989). ''The Pacific Islands''. University of Hawaii Press. p. 45. {{ISBN|0824812336}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Coulter, John Wesley. (Jun, 1964) "Great Britain in Hawaii: The Captain Cook Monument". ''The Geographical Journal'', Vol. 130, No. 2. {{doi|10.2307/1794586}}&lt;/ref&gt; Debate continues as to whether the Hawaiian Islands were actually visited by the Spanish in the 16th century&lt;ref&gt;Horwitz, Tony.

==Pending transboundary nominations==
[[File:Manilajf9742 16.JPG|thumb|The Manila-Acapulco Galleon Memorial at Plaza Mexico in Intramuros, Manila.]]

In 2014, the idea to nominate the Manila-Acapulco Galleon Trade Route was initiated by the Mexican ambassador to UNESCO with the Filipino ambassador to [[UNESCO]].

An Experts' Roundtable Meeting was held at the [[University of Santo Tomas]] (UST) on April 23, 2015 as part of the preparation of the Philippines for the possible transnational nomination of the Manila-Acapulco Galleon Trade Route to the World Heritage List. The nomination will be made jointly with Mexico.

The following are the experts and the topics they discussed during the roundtable meeting: Dr. Celestina Boncan on the Tornaviaje; Dr. Mary Jane A. Bolunia on Shipyards in the Bicol Region; Mr. Sheldon Clyde Jago-on, Bobby Orillaneda, and Ligaya Lacsina on Underwater Archaeology; Dr. Leovino Garcia on Maps and Cartography; Fr. Rene Javellana, S.J. on Fortifications in the Philippines; Felice Sta. Maria on Food; Dr. Fernando Zialcita on Textile; and Regalado Trota Jose on Historical Dimension. The papers presented and discussed during the roundtable meeting will be synthesized into a working document to establish the route's Outstanding Universal Value.&lt;ref name="gov.ph"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.ph/2015/04/28/ph-mexico-push-to-nominate-manila-acapulco-galleon-trade-route-to-world-heritage-list/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161014061744/https://www.gov.ph/2015/04/28/ph-mexico-push-to-nominate-manila-acapulco-galleon-trade-route-to-world-heritage-list/|archivedate=14 October 2016|title=PH, Mexico push to nominate Manila-Acapulco Galleon Trade Route to World Heritage List |publisher=Official Gazette of the Republic of the Philippines |date=28 April 2015 |accessdate=14 December 2017}} {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mexican side reiterated that they will also follow suit with the preparations for the route's nomination.

Spain has also backed the nomination of the route in the World Heritage List and has also suggested the archives related to the route under the possession of the Philippines, Mexico, and Spain to be nominated as part of another UNESCO list, the Memory of the World Register.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2015/07/05/1473367/spain-backs-inclusion-galleon-trade-route-world-heritage-list&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, the Philippines established the [[The Galeón|Manila-Acapulco Galleon Museum]] in Metro Manila, one of the necessary steps in nominating the trade route to UNESCO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://businessmirror.com.ph/manila-acapulco-galleon-museum-rises-in-sm-moa/|title=Manila-Acapulco Galleon Museum rises in SM MOA|author=|date=|website=businessmirror.com.ph}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mont Idoukal-n-Taghès''' (also '''Mont Bagzane''', '''Mont Bagzan''') is the highest mountain in [[Niger]]. Mont Idoukal-n-Taghès is located in the south central [[Aïr Mountains]], and is at the northern end of the [[Bagzane plateau]].  The village and pilgrimage site of [[Abatol]] sits at the base of the peak.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nigerianfield.org/lagos_files/photos-niger.htm The Nigerian Field Society: Lagos Branch. Trip to Niger Republic, October 2003] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080519010621/http://www.nigerianfield.org/lagos_files/photos-niger.htm |date=2008-05-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;    The Aouderas valley, the path of a seasonal wash (or [[Wadi|Kouri]]) runs south from the foot of Idoukal-n-Taghès towards [[Agadez]], the regional capital.  The oasis town of [[Aouderas]] is just southwest of the mountain. Due to its high elevation, mount Idoukal'n'Taghes has been found to host a number of Saharan-Mediterranean and Tropical plant species that have never been recorded elsewhere in Niger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Anthelme | first1 = F. | last2 = Waziri Mato | first2 = M. | last3 = Maley | first3 = J. | year = 2008 | title =  Elevation and local refuges ensure persistence of mountain specific vegetation in the Nigerien Sahara| url = | journal = Journal of Arid Environments| volume =  72| issue = 12| pages =  2232–2242| doi = 10.1016/j.jaridenv.2008.07.003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Official Nigerien and international sources believed [[Mont Gréboun]], far to the north, to be the highest peak in the nation as late as 2001, when Gréboun's long standing lower measurement confirmed at 1944 m, which had variously been measured as high as 2310 m.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peakbagger.com/peak.aspx?pid=11062 Peakbagger listing].  Compare  Jolijn Geels (2006) pp 177, 183-84 and Decalo (1997) p. 216.&lt;/ref&gt;  Greboun has a much greater local relief, rising from near the desert floor, while Idoukal-n-Taghès sits atop a high massif with an average altitude above 1600 meters.

To honour the highest point in Niger, the official aircraft of the [[President of Niger]] is named ''Mont Bagzane''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.airliners.net/search/photo.search?regsearch=5U-BAG&amp;distinct_entry=true Photos of the Boeing 737-2N9C numbered 5U-BAG], with readable title on nose.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''NMEA 2000''', abbreviated to '''NMEA2k''' or '''N2K''' and standardised as '''IEC 61162-3''', is a plug-and-play communications standard used for connecting marine sensors and display units within ships and boats. Communication runs at 250 kilobits-per-second and allows any sensor to talk to any display unit or other device compatible with NMEA 2000 protocols.  Electrically, NMEA 2000 is compatible with the [[Controller Area Network]] ("CAN Bus") used on road vehicles and fuel engines.  The higher-level protocol format is based on [[SAE J1939]], with specific messages for the marine environment.  [[Seatalk#Seatalk2|Raymarine SeaTalk 2]], [[Seatalk#SeatalkNG|Raymarine SeaTalk&lt;sup&gt;NG&lt;/sup&gt;]], Simrad Simnet, and Furuno CAN are rebranded implementations of NMEA 2000, though may use physical connectors different from the standardised [[DeviceNet]] Micro-C M12 5-pin screw connector, all of which are electrically compatible and can be directly connected.

The protocol is used to create a network of electronic devices—chiefly marine instruments—on a boat. Various instruments that meet the NMEA 2000 standard are connected to one central cable, known as a backbone. The backbone powers each instrument and relays data among all of the instruments on the network. This allows one display unit to show many different types of information. It also allows the instruments to work together, since they share data. NMEA 2000 is meant to be "plug and play" to allow devices made by different manufacturers to communicate with each other.

Examples of marine electronic devices to include in a network are [[GPS]] receivers, [[auto pilots]], wind instruments, depth sounders, [[navigation]] instruments, [[engine]] instruments, and [[nautical chart]] plotters. The interconnectivity among instruments in the network allows, for example, the [[GPS]] receiver to correct the course that the autopilot is steering.

== History ==
The NMEA 2000 standard was defined by, and is controlled by, the US-based [[National Marine Electronics Association]] (NMEA). Although the NMEA divulges some information regarding the standard, it claims copyright over the standard and thus its full contents are not publicly available. For example, the NMEA publicizes which messages exist and which fields they contain, but they do not disclose how to interpret the values contained in those fields. However, enthusiasts are slowly making progress in discovering these PGN definitions.&lt;ref&gt;https://github.com/canboat/canboat/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Functionality ==
NMEA 2000 connects devices using [[Controller Area Network]] (CAN) technology originally developed for the auto industry.  NMEA 2000 is based on the [[SAE J1939]] high-level protocol, but defines its own messages.  NMEA 2000 devices and J1939 devices can be made to co-exist on the same physical network.

NMEA 2000 ([[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] 61162-3) can be considered a successor to the [[NMEA 0183]] (IEC 61162-1) serial data bus standard.  It has a significantly higher data rate (250k bits/second vs. 4800 bits/second for NMEA 0183).  It uses a compact binary message format as opposed to the ASCII [[serial communication]]s protocol used by NMEA 0183.  Another improvement is that NMEA 2000 supports a disciplined multiple-talker, multiple-listener data network whereas NMEA 0183 requires a single-talker, multiple-listener ([[simplex]]) serial [[communications protocol]].

==Network construction==
The NMEA 2000 network, like the SAE J1939 network on which it is based, is organized around a bus topology, and requires a single 120Ω termination resistor at each end of the bus. (The resistors are in parallel, so a properly terminated bus should have a total resistance of 60Ω).  The maximum distance for any device from the bus is six metres. The maximum backbone cable length is 100 m (328 ft)
[[File:NMEA2000 Modified motor yacht.jpg|thumb|right|Typical NMEA 2000 Network Installation]]

==Cabling and interconnect==
The only cabling standard approved by the NMEA for use with NMEA 2000 networks is the [[DeviceNet]] cabling standard, which is controlled by the [[Open DeviceNet Vendors Association]]. Such cabling systems are permitted to be labeled "NMEA 2000 Approved". The DeviceNet standard defines levels of shielding, conductor size, weather resistance, and flexibility which are not necessarily met by other cabling solutions marketed as "NMEA 2000" compatible.

There are two sizes of cabling defined by the DeviceNet/NMEA 2000 standard. The larger of the two sizes is denoted as "Mini" (or alternatively, "Thick") cable, and is rated to carry up to 8 Amperes of power supply current.  The smaller of the two sizes is denoted as "Micro" (or alternatively, "Thin") cable using the M12 5-pin barrel connector specified in IEC 61076-2-101, and is rated to carry up to 3 Amperes of power supply current.

Mini cable is primarily used as a "backbone" (or "trunk") for networks on larger vessels (typically with lengths of 20 m and above), with Micro cable used for connections between the network backbone and the individual components.  Networks on smaller vessels often are constructed entirely of Micro cable and connectors.

An NMEA 2000 network is not electrically compatible with an NMEA 0183 network, and so an interface device is required to send messages between devices on the different types of network. An adapter is also required if NMEA 2000 messages are to be received by or transmitted from a PC.

==Message format and parameter group numbers (PGNs){{anchor|PGN}}==
{{unreferenced|section|date=June 2017}}
In accordance with the SAE J1939 protocol, NMEA 2000 messages are sent as packets that consist of a header followed by (typically) 8 bytes of data. The header for a message specifies the transmitting device, the device to which the message was sent (which may be all devices), the message priority, and the PGN (Parameter Group Number). The PGN indicates which message is being sent, and thus how the data bytes should be interpreted to determine the values of the data fields that the message contains.

A parameter group definition may describe a data record that consists of more data than can be contained within a single CAN frame.&lt;ref&gt;Spitzer 2009, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; NMEA 2000 transfer methods include transmitting single-frame parameter groups and two methods of transmitting multi-frame parameter groups. These transfer methods are compared below:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Single frame
! ISO 11783 multi-packet
! NMEA 2000 fast packet
|-
| 8 bytes
| Up to 1,785 bytes
| Up to 223 bytes
|-
| Broadcast by default unless pf &lt; 0xF0
| Can be used to send any message up to 1,785 to a specific device with flow control (RTS/CTS) or broadcast (BAM)
| Broadcast by default unless pf &lt; 0xF0
|-
| CAN layer assures all (connected) nodes received the message and validated its CRC
| With handshaking (RTS/CTS) / time based (50&amp;nbsp;ms) in case of BAM (broadcast)
| No handshaking
|-
| No transfer protocol delays
| Takes longer to send the same amount of data as fast packet
| Takes less time to send up to 223 bytes; no transfer protocol delays; no guarantee it is received by all nodes
|-
| Implemented by all industries
| Implemented by all industries
| NMEA 2000 and adopted by ISO for GNSS Con/Ag applications
|}

The Multi-Packet protocol specified in ISO 11783-3 provides for the transmission of multi-frame parameter groups up to 1,785 bytes. The protocol encapsulates the parameter group in a transport protocol, either globally or to a specific address. In case of address specific transfer (RTS/CTS), the receiving device can control the data flow in accordance with the receiving device’s available resources. In both cases (RTS/CTS) verus BAM. the message being transferred is announced in the first message. In case of CTS/RTS the receiver can refuse the message. In case of a BAM the message can simply be ignored.

The Fast Packet protocol defined in NMEA 2000 provides a means to stream up to 223 bytes of data, with the advantage that each frame retains the parameter group identity and priority. The first frame transmitted uses 2 bytes to identify sequential Fast Packet parameter groups and sequential frames within a single parameter group transmission. The first byte contains a sequence counter to distinguish consecutive transmission of the same parameter groups and a frame counter set to frame zero. The second byte in the first frame identifies the total size of the parameter group to follow. Successive frames use just single data byte for the sequence counter and the frame counter. Because many of the NMEA 2000 parameter groups exceed 8 bytes but do not require the 1,785-byte capacity of multi-packet, the default method of transmitting multi-frame parameter groups in NMEA 2000 is using the Fast Packet protocol.

Regardless of which protocol is used, multi-frame parameter groups are sent on a frame-by-frame basis and may be interspersed with other higher priority parameter groups using either protocol, or even single- frame parameter groups. Each device is responsible for reassembling the parameter group once all the frames for the parameter group are transmitted.

==Device certification==
Devices go through a certification process overseen by the NMEA, and are permitted to display the "NMEA 2000 Certified" logo once they have completed the certification process. The certification process does not guarantee data content, that is the responsibility of the manufacturers. However, the certification process does assure that products from different manufacturers exchange data in a compatible way and that they can coexist on a network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nmea.org/Assets/20160104%20final%20nmea2000%20certification%20process%20and%20license%20agreement.pdf |title=NMEA 2000® Certification Process Overview and License Agreement |accessdate=2017-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== NMEA 2000 and proprietary networks ==
Several manufacturers, including [[Simrad Yachting|Simrad]], [[Raymarine]], [[Stowe Marine|Stowe]], and [[Mastervolt]], have their own proprietary networks that are compatible with or akin to NMEA 2000. Simrad's is called SimNet, and Raymarine's is called [[Seatalk#SeatalkNG|''SeaTalk NG'']]. Stowe's is called ''Dataline 2000''. Some of these, such as SimNet and Seatalk NG, are a standard NMEA 2000 network but use non-standard connectors and cabling; adapters are available to convert to standard NMEA 2000 connectors, or the user can simply remove the connector and make a direct connection.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.panbo.com/archives/2008/02/n2k_cable_mixing_not_a_big_woop.html N2K, cable mixing not a big woop , Panbo, Feb 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Trademarks ==
The term "NMEA 2000" is a registered trademark of the National Marine Electronics Association. Devices which are not "NMEA 2000 Certified" may not legally use the NMEA 2000 trademark in their advertising.

[[File:NWPDX.tif|thumb|The Northwest Passage Drive Expedition (NWPDX) (2009-2011)]]
[[Image:NWPDX-2010 Moon-1.JPG|thumb|right|The ''HMP Okarian'' during the NWPDX.]]
The '''Northwest Passage Drive Expedition''' (NWPDX) (2009-2011) was a multi-stage vehicular expedition from the North American mainland to [[Devon Island]] in the high [[Arctic]], by way of the [[Northwest Passage]]. The expedition was led by planetary scientist [[Pascal Lee]]. Although the expedition was primarily logistical and was not intended to be a high fidelity simulation of a crewed pressurized rover traverse on the Moon or Mars, it was the first long-distance road trip dedicated to planetary exploration studies and provided important lessons for planning future long-range vehicular traverses off Earth. The expedition was also the first crossing of the [[Northwest Passage]] in a road vehicle. The first stage of the expedition, NWPDX-2009, established a record for the longest distance driven continuously on sea-ice in a road vehicle: {{Convert|496|km|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="ab2010"&gt;Lee, P. 2010. Northwest Passage Drive : Preparing for Mars. ''Above &amp; Beyond – Canada’s Arctic Journal''. Sept–Oct 2010, 35–39.&lt;/ref&gt;

The expedition’s main objective was to deliver the [[Mars Institute]]’s ''HMP Okarian'' rover (aka ''Moon-1 Humvee Rover''), a modified [[Humvee]] serving as a planetary pressurized rover simulator, from the North American mainland to the [[Haughton-Mars Project]] Research Station on [[Devon Island]]. Once delivered, the ''HMP Okarian'' would be used for research - through simulations of planetary excursion missions - to plan future human Moon and Mars exploration. The Northwest Passage Drive Expedition was proposed by HMP principal investigator [[Pascal Lee]] when rover operations on [[Devon Island]] using the HMP’s first [[Humvee]] alone, the ''Mars-1'', proved too risky, and a second [[Humvee]] (the ''HMP Okarian'') became needed at the HMP site.

The expedition’s secondary objectives were scientific: to measure the thickness of the sea-ice along the [[Northwest Passage]] to document [[Climate change in the Arctic]], to quantify the potential microbial forward contamination of future pressurized rover traverses on the Moon and Mars,&lt;ref name="astrobio2010"&gt;{{cite conference |last=Schuerger |first=Andrew|last2=Lee |first2=Pascal |title=Extremely low levels of dispersal observed for human-associated microbes into a local pristine terrain during a simulated moon traverse on sea-ice along the Northwest Passage in the Arctic |url=http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/abscicon2010/pdf/5377.pdf |format=PDF |conference=Astrobiology Science Conference 2010 (2010) |conferenceurl=http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/abscicon2010/ |date=April 26–29, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="astrobio2015"&gt;Schuerger, A.

''Astrobiology'', 15, 6, 478-491.&lt;/ref&gt; and to study the logistics of planning and implementing pressurized rover traverses on the Moon and Mars.&lt;ref name="ab2010" /&gt;

The expedition was supported by [[NASA]], the [[Mars Institute]], and the [[SETI Institute]]. Other government agencies ([[Air National Guard]], [[Canadian Space Agency]], Nunavut Research Institute, Polar Continental Shelf Project, and others) and private partners ([[AM General]], [[Bombardier Recreational Products]], [[Mattracks Inc.]], [[First Air]] and others) provided additional support.

==Overview==
The Northwest Passage Drive Expedition took place in three stages over the course of three arctic field seasons, departing [[Kugluktuk]] on the North American mainland in April 2009, and ending at the [[Haughton-Mars Project]] Research Station on [[Devon Island]] in July 2011. The three stages of the expedition are designated NWPDX-2009, NWPDX-2010, and NWPDX-2011. 
The NWPDX-2009 expedition departed [[Kugluktuk]] on 10 April 2009, and reached [[Cambridge Bay]] on [[Victoria Island (Canada)|Victoria Island]] on 17 April 2009. The ''HMP Okarian'' was then flown by the US [[Air National Guard]] from [[Cambridge Bay]] to [[Resolute Bay]] on [[Cornwallis Island (Nunavut)|Cornwallis Island]] in May 2009. The NWPDX-2010 expedition departed [[Resolute Bay]] on 5 May 2010, and reached the West coast of [[Devon Island]] on 16 May 2010. The NWPDX-2011 expedition departed the West coast of [[Devon Island]] on 18 July 2011, and reached the HMP Research Station on 20 July 2011. The NWPDX-2009 and 2010 expeditions consisted of the ''HMP Okarian'' equipped with tracks, and two snowmobiles, each vehicle towing a [[qamutiik]] [[sled]] loaded with equipment and supplies. The NWPDX-2011 expedition consisted of the ''HMP Okarian'' on wheels, escorted by two [[all-terrain vehicle]]s or quad bikes.

==Preparations==
Initial planning of the expedition took place in 2008 and 2009.  The ''HMP Okarian'' was originally a military ambulance [[Humvee]] on loan from [[AM General]] to Hollywood where it was featured in many films and TV shows, notably in ''[[The Rock (film)|The Rock]]'' (1996). When the Northwest Passage Drive Expedition project was approved, the vehicle was called back to the [[AM General]] factory to be refurbished and modified to become the ''HMP Okarian''.&lt;ref name="ab2010" /&gt;

==Journey==

===NWPDX-2009===

The 2009 campaign was led by Lee and included geologist and explorer [[John Schutt]] as expedition navigator and field guide, arctic expert Joe Amarualik as expedition scout, vehicle engineer Jesse Weaver as expedition technician, and documentary filmmaker Mark Carroll as cameraman. The expedition departed [[Kugluktuk]] on 10 April 2009 but soon encountered difficulties with weather and thick snow cover on the sea-ice which slowed down progress and increased fuel consumption. On 15 April 2009, the ''HMP Okarian'' was almost lost in an ice lead incident, but was successfully salvaged by the expedition team. The expedition reached [[Cambridge Bay]] on 17 April 2009.&lt;ref name="ab2010" /&gt; The ''HMP Okarian'' was subsequently airlifted by the US [[Air National Guard]] from [[Cambridge Bay]] to [[Resolute Bay]] in May 2009.

===NWPDX-2010===
The 2010 campaign was led by Lee and included the same team members as the NWPDX-2009 expedition, plus filmmaker [[Jean-Christophe Jeauffre]] as documentary film director. The expedition departed [[Resolute Bay]] on 5 May 2010 but the ''HMP Okarian'' soon experienced a series of mechanical problems, including the breakage of critical parts on 6 May 2010 and again on 13 May 2010. The expedition was ultimately completed when Lee sent Amarualik back to Resolute Bay solo by snowmobile to retrieve a replacement part, and later Schutt and Weaver to the HMP Research Station on Devon Island, also by snowmobile, to scavenge a replacement part from the ''Mars-1 Humvee Rover''. The expedition, including the ''HMP Okarian'', eventually reached the west coast of [[Devon Island]] on 16 May 2010, at a location subsequently named Humvee Beach.&lt;ref name="ab2010" /&gt;

===NWPDX-2011===
The 2011 campaign was led by Lee and included space engineer Robert Mueller of NASA [[Kennedy Space Center]] as navigator, vehicle engineer Jesse Weaver as expedition technician, and filmmaker Jody Shapiro as cameraman. The expedition departed Humvee Beach on 18 July 2011, and reached the HMP Research Station on 20 July 2011.

==Accomplishments==
Although the expedition experienced a number of challenges, including an instance where the ''HMP Okarian'' was almost lost in a sea-ice lead, it was successful in achieving its primary goal of safely delivering the rover to the [[Haughton-Mars Project]] Research Station on [[Devon Island]]. The expedition was also successful in meeting its secondary goal of collecting new data relating to the planning and implementation of future long-range crewed pressurized rover traverses on the Moon and Mars,&lt;ref name="ab2010" /&gt; including the first field study of the risk of forward contamination during future crewed rover operations.&lt;ref name="astrobio2010"&gt;{{cite conference |last=Schuerger |first=Andrew|last2=Lee |first2=Pascal |title=Extremely low levels of dispersal observed for human-associated microbes into a local pristine terrain during a simulated moon traverse on sea-ice along the Northwest Passage in the Arctic |url=http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/abscicon2010/pdf/5377.pdf |format=PDF |conference=Astrobiology Science Conference 2010 (2010) |conferenceurl=http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/abscicon2010/ |date=April 26–29, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="astrobio2015"&gt;Schuerger, A. C. &amp; P. Lee 2015. Microbial Ecology of a Crewed Rover Traverse in the Arctic: Low Microbial Dispersal and Implications for Planetary Protection on Human Mars Missions. ''Astrobiology'', 15, 6, 478-491.&lt;/ref&gt; While the ''HMP Okarian'' experienced a series mechanical problems during its journey, some requiring that crew members be dispatched to retrieve spare parts and supplies, all such retrievals and repairs were carried out by the expedition crew alone, as a crew on the Moon or Mars would need to were it stranded some distance away from a base or a cache of supplies.
Ancillary to its main goals, the expedition achieved the first crossing of the [[Northwest Passage]] in a road vehicle. The first stage of the expedition, NWPDX-2009, established a record for the longest distance driven continuously on sea-ice in a road vehicle: {{Convert|496|km|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="ab2010"&gt;Lee, P. 2010. Northwest Passage Drive : Preparing for Mars. ''Above &amp; Beyond – Canada’s Arctic Journal''. Sept–Oct 2010, 35–39.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Outreach==

===Okarian Name===
The ''HMP Okarian'' was originally named ''Moon-1 Humvee Rover'' and painted yellow, to distinguish it from the red-colored ''Mars-1 Humvee Rover'' already is use on the [[Haughton-Mars Project]]. The ''Moon-1'' was subsequently renamed ''Okarian'', in reference to the ''Okarians'' imagined by [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]] in ''[[The Warlord of Mars]]'', a race of Yellow Martians who migrated to the North Pole of Mars and lived there in domed cities.

===Passage To Mars===
The Northwest Passage Drive Expedition is captured in the 2016 documentary film ''Passage to Mars'' directed by [[Jean-Christophe Jeauffre]], and narrated by [[Zachary Quinto]] as [[Pascal Lee]].

'''Otto Kersten''' (23 December 1839 in [[Altenburg]] &amp;ndash; 22 November 1900 in Altenburg) was a German chemist and geographer.

He studied chemistry and natural sciences at the [[University of Leipzig]], and after graduation, worked as an assistant at the vocational school in [[Chemnitz]]. In 1862 he took part in [[Karl Klaus von der Decken]]'s expedition in East Africa, where the two men made a partial ascent (4280 m) of [[Mount Kilimanjaro]]. In 1863 he traveled with von der Decken to the [[Seychelles]] and the [[Mascarenes]], and during the following year, Kersten visited [[Madagascar]], the [[Comoros]] and [[Mafia Island]]. In 1865 he returned to Europe.&lt;ref name=ME&gt;[http://www.zeno.org/Meyers-1905/A/Kersten "Kersten"] ''Meyers Großes Konversations-Lexikon''. (in German).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AC&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=nxANAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA79&amp;lpg=PA79&amp;dq=%22Kersten,+Otto%22+1839+Altenburg&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=yZZ7w3zjnm&amp;sig=D8Y9E824uSeZf984ahzrW4wPkz8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwimkM685enOAhXI5SYKHV8wBs8Q6AEIPzAF#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Kersten%2C%20Otto%22%201839%20Altenburg&amp;f=false ''Biographisches Jahrbuch und Deutscher Nekrolog''] edited by Anton Bettelheim. (in German).&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1870 he served at [[List of German consuls in Jerusalem, Jaffa, Haifa and Eilat#German consuls and consuls general|the German consulate in]] [[Jerusalem]], and in 1875 became manager of a chemical factory in [[Berlin]]. In 1878, with Robert Jannasch, he founded the ''Zentralverein für Handelsgeographie'' (Central Association for Economic Geography). In 1883 he carried out [[economic geography]] research in [[Morocco]].&lt;ref name=ME/&gt;&lt;ref name=AC/&gt;

In 1869–79 he published [https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/001609571 ''Baron Carl Claus von der Decken's Reisen in Ost-Afrika in den Jahren 1859 bis 1865''] ("Decken's journeys in East Africa in 1859–65"; 4 volumes). Its editors included [[Wilhelm Peters]], [[Jean Cabanis]], [[Franz Martin Hilgendorf]], [[Eduard von Martens]], [[Carl Eduard Adolph Gerstaecker]], [[Otto Finsch]], [[Gustav Hartlaub]], et al.

Keall |accessdate=23 November 2017|publisher=Pleiades}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name is first mentioned by [[Herodotus]], who calls one of the tribes of the [[Medians]] ''Paraetaceni''.&lt;ref&gt;Herod., i. 101.&lt;/ref&gt; The same district comprehended what are now called the [[Bakhtyari]] mountains and tribes. The whole country was rugged and mountainous&lt;ref&gt;[[Strabo]], ii. p. 80, xi. p. 522, xv. p. 723; [[Pliny the Elder|Plin.]] vi. 27. s. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; and appears to have been inhabited, like the adjacent province of [[Cossaea]], by wild and robber tribes.&lt;ref&gt;Strabo, xvi. p. 744.&lt;/ref&gt; The inhabitants were called ''Paraetaceni''&lt;ref&gt;Herod., i. 101; Strab., xv. p. 732&lt;/ref&gt; or ''Paraetacae.''&lt;ref&gt;Strab. xv. p. 736; [[Arrian]], iii. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been considerable discussion with regard to the origin of this name. The best determination seems to be that it is derived from a [[Persian language|Persian]] word, ''Paruta'', signifying mountain; and this again, from the [[Sanskrit]] ''Parvata''. It will be observed that while Herodotus gives the Paraetceni a Median origin,&lt;ref&gt;Herod., i. 101.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Stephanus of Byzantium]] calls Paraetaca a Median town, [[Strabo]] gives one portion of the district so named to the [[Assyria]]n province of Apolloniatis or [[Sittacene]].&lt;ref&gt;Strab., xvi. p. 736.&lt;/ref&gt; There were, however, other places of the same name at considerable distances from the Median or Persian province. Thus, one is mentioned between [[Bactriana]] and [[Sogdiana]], between the [[Oxus]] and [[Jaxartes]],&lt;ref&gt;Arrian, iv. 21; [[Quintus Curtius Rufus|Curt]]. viii. 14. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; and another between [[Drangiana]] and [[Arachosia]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Isidore of Charax|Isid. Char.]] p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[India]], too, we find the ''Paryeti Montes'', one of the outlying spurs of the still greater chain of the [[Paropamisus]] (or Hindu Kush).&lt;ref&gt;Lassen, in Ersch and Grüber, Encycl. ''s. v. Paraetacene''.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ponta do Seixas''' ({{IPA-pt|ˈpõtɐ du ˈsejʃɐs}}), also known as '''Cape Branco''',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/77600/Cape-Branco|title = Cape Branco {{!}} cape, Brazil|website = Encyclopædia Britannica|access-date = 2016-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Headlands and bays|cape]] on the [[Atlantic]] coast of [[Paraíba]] state, eastern [[Brazil]], that forms the easternmost point of the [[Americas|American]] continents, roughly 8&amp;nbsp;km (5&amp;nbsp;mi) southeast of [[João Pessoa, Paraíba|João Pessoa]], the state capital.

It is surrounded by white sand beaches bordered by flat-topped forms of sedimentary strata called "tabuleiros", which rise sharply above the beaches to heights between 150 and 500&amp;nbsp;ft, and enjoys abundant rainfall. It lies on the coastal highway connecting João Pessoa and the port of [[Cabedelo]] farther north.

 [[File:River Orchy erosion potholes.jpg|thumb|[[River Orchy]], Scotland, showing erosion potholes in bedrock]]
The [[Earth science|Earth scientists]], who study [[river]]s and streams, define a '''pothole''' as a smooth, bowl-shaped or cylindrical hollow, generally deeper than wide, found carved into the rocky bed of a watercourse. Other names used for riverine potholes are '''pot''', (stream) '''kettle''', '''[[giant's kettle]]''', '''evorsion''', '''hollow''', '''rock mill''', '''churn hole''', '''eddy mill''', and '''kolk'''.&lt;ref name="NeuendorfOthers2011a"&gt;Neuendorf, K.K.E., J.P. Mehl, Jr., and J.A. Jackson, eds., 2011. ''Glossary of Geology'' (5th ed.). Alexandria, Virginia, American Geological Institute. 800 pp. {{ISBN|0-922152-89-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although somewhat  related to a pothole in origin, a '''[[plunge pool]]''' (or '''plunge basin''' or '''waterfall lake''') is the deep depression in a stream bed at the base of a [[waterfall]]; it is created by the [[erosion|erosional]] forces of [[turbulence]] generated by water falling on rocks at a waterfall's base where the water impacts.&lt;ref name= Marshak2009a&gt;Marshak, Stephen, 2009. ''Essentials of Geology,'' W. W. Norton &amp; Company, 3rd ed. {{ISBN|978-0393196566}}&lt;/ref&gt; Potholes are also sometimes referred to as '''swirlholes'''. This word was created to avoid confusion with an English term for a vertical or steeply inclined [[karst]]ic shaft in [[limestone]]. However, given widespread usage of this term for a type of fluvial sculpted bedrock landform, ''pothole'' is preferred in usage to ''swirlhole''.&lt;ref name="RichardsonOthers2005a"&gt;Richardson, K. and Carling, P., 2005. ''A typology of sculpted forms in open bedrock channels.'' ''Special Paper'' 392. Boulder, Colorado: Geological Society of America. 108 pp. {{ISBN|0-813723-92-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''pothole'' is also used to refer to other types of depressions and basins that differ in origin.&lt;ref name="NeuendorfOthers2011a"/&gt; For example, some authors&lt;ref name="ChanOthers2005a"&gt;Chan, M.A., Moser, K., Davis, J.M., Southam, G., Hughes, K. and Graham, T., 2005. ''Desert potholes: ephemeral aquatic microsystems.'' ''Aquatic Geochemistry'', 11(3), pp. 279-302.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hughes2012a"&gt;Hughes, Kebbi A., 2012.

Paper 543.&lt;/ref&gt; refer to ''[[panhole]]s'' found in the [[Colorado Plateau]] also as ''potholes''. Other terms used for panholes are ''gnamma'' (Australia), ''opferkessel'' (German, roughly “sacrificial basin”), ''armchair hollows'', ''weathering pans'' (or ''pits'') and ''solution pans'' or ''solution pits''.&lt;ref name=TwidaleOthers2018a&gt;Twidale, C.R., and Bourne, J.A., 2018.

==Origin==
The consensus of geomorphologists and sedimentologists is that fluvial potholes are created by the grinding action of either a stone or stones or coarse [[sediment]] ([[sand]], [[gravel]], [[pebble]]s, [[boulder]]s), whirled around and kept in motion by eddies within and force of the stream current in a given spot. Being a spectacular feature of bedrock river [[Channel (geography)|channel]]s, they have been and still are studied extensively and considered as a key factor in bedrock channel development and morphology and important factor in the incision of  bedrock channels.&lt;ref name="RichardsonOthers2005a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Das2018a"&gt;Das, B.C., 2018.

A '''princely state''', also called '''native state''', '''feudatory state''' or '''Indian state''' (for those states on the subcontinent), was a [[vassal state]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ramusack|2004|pp=85}} Quote: "The British did not create the Indian princes. Before and during the European penetration of India, indigenous rulers achieved dominance through the military protection they provided to dependents and their skill in acquiring revenues to maintain their military and administrative organisations. Major Indian rulers exercised varying degrees and types of sovereign powers before they entered treaty relations with the British. What changed during the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries is that the British increasingly restricted the sovereignty of Indian rulers. The [[East India Company|Company]] set boundaries; it extracted resources in the form of military personnel, subsidies or tribute payments, and the purchase of commercial goods at favourable prices, and limited opportunities for other alliances. From the 1810s onwards as the British expanded and consolidated their power, their centralised military despotism dramatically reduced the political options of Indian rulers." (p. 85)&lt;/ref&gt; under a local or regional ruler in a [[subsidiary alliance]] with the [[British Raj]]. Though the history of the princely states of the subcontinent dates from at least the [[Middle kingdoms of India|classical period of Indian history]], the predominant usage of the term ''princely state'' specifically refers to a semi-sovereign principality on the [[Indian subcontinent]] during the [[British Raj]] that was not directly governed by the British, but rather by a local ruler, subject to a form of [[indirect rule]] on some matters. In actual fact, the imprecise doctrine of [[British paramountcy|paramountcy]] allowed the government of British India to interfere in the internal affairs of princely states and edict laws that applied to all of India when it deemed it necessary.

At the time of the British withdrawal, 565 princely states were officially recognised in the Indian subcontinent,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.worldstatesmen.org/India_princes_A-J.html&lt;/ref&gt; apart from thousands of [[Thakur (title)|thakurs]], [[taluqdar]]s, [[zamindar]]is and [[jagir]]s. In 1947, princely states covered 48% of area of pre-Independent India and constituted 28% of its population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/who-betrayed-sardar-patel/article5366083.ece|title=Who betrayed Sardar Patel?}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most important states had their own British Political Residencies: [[Hyderabad State|Hyderabad]], [[Mysore State|Mysore]] and [[Travancore State|Travancore]] in the South followed by [[Jammu and Kashmir (princely state)|Jammu and Kashmir]] and [[Kingdom of Sikkim|Sikkim]] in the Himalayas, and [[Indore State|Indore]] in Central India. The most prominent among those – roughly a quarter of the total – had the status of a [[salute state]], one whose ruler was entitled to a set number of [[gun salute]]s on ceremonial occasions.

The princely states varied greatly in status, size, and wealth; the premier 21-gun salute states of Hyderabad, Jammu and Kashmir were each over 200,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in size. In 1941, Hyderabad had a population of over 16 million, while Jammu and Kashmir had a population of slightly over 4 million. At the other end of the scale, the non-salute principality of [[Lawa Thikana|Lawa]] covered an area of 49&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, with a population of just below 3,000. Some two hundred of the lesser states had an area of less than 25&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (10&amp;nbsp;mi&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref name="Markovits2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Markovits, Claude |title=A history of modern India, 1480–1950|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uzOmy2y0Zh4C|year=2004|publisher=Anthem Press|pages=386–409}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="scale"&gt;{{cite book|pages=33–37|title=The India Office and Burma Office List: 1945|first= |last=|publisher=Harrison &amp; Sons, Ltd.|year=1945|ISBN=|subject=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The era of the princely states effectively ended with Indian independence in 1947. By 1950, almost all of the principalities had [[Instrument of Accession|acceded]] to either India or Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;Ravi Kumar Pillai of Kandamath in the Journal of the Royal Society for Asian Affairs, pages 316–319 https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03068374.2016.1171621&lt;/ref&gt; The accession process was largely peaceful, except in the cases of [[Jammu and Kashmir (princely state)|Jammu and Kashmir]] (whose ruler opted for independence but decided to accede to India following an invasion by Pakistan-based forces),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bajwa|first=Kuldip Singh|title=Jammu and Kashmir War, 1947–1948: Political and Military Perspectiv|year=2003|publisher=Hari-Anand Publications Limited|location=New Delhi|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=7bREjE5yXNMC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA21&amp;dq=dogra+1948+tribal+pakistan+invasion&amp;ots=B8Ib4XPpLr&amp;sig=y_lQsLt4gQB-c32WiCgbnb7ZNh8#v=onepage&amp;q=dogra%201948%20tribal%20pakistan%20invasion&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hyderabad]] (whose ruler opted for independence in 1947, followed a year later by [[Operation Polo|the police action and annexation]] of the state by India), [[Junagadh State|Junagadh]] (whose ruler acceded to Pakistan, but was annexed by India).&lt;ref name="Pande2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Aparna Pande|title=Explaining Pakistan’s Foreign Policy: Escaping India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HPWrAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT31|date=16 March 2011|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1-136-81893-6|pages=31–}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Khanate of Kalat|Kalat]] (whose ruler declared independence in 1947, followed in 1948 by the state's annexation).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Jalal |first=Ayesha |authorlink=Ayesha Jalal |title=The Struggle for Pakistan: A Muslim Homeland and Global Politics |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=87VnBAAAQBAJ |year=2014 |publisher=Harvard University Press |ISBN=978-0-674-74499-8 |ref={{sfnref|Jalal, Struggle for Pakistan|2014}} |p=72}}: "Equally notorious was his high-handed treatment of the state of Kalat, whose ruler was made to accede to Pakistan on threat of punitive military action."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Samad |first1=Yunas |authorlink=Yunas Samad |title=Understanding the insurgency in Balochistan |journal=Commonwealth &amp; Comparative Politics |volume=52 |issue=2 |year=2014 |pages=293–320 |doi=10.1080/14662043.2014.894280 |ref={{sfnref|Samad, Understanding the insurgency in Balochistan|2014}}}}: "When Mir Ahmed Yar Khan dithered over acceding the Baloch-Brauhi confederacy to Pakistan in 1947 the centre’s response was to initiate processes that would coerce the state joining Pakistan. By recognising the feudatory states of Las Bela, Kharan and the district of Mekran as independent states, which promptly merged with Pakistan, the State of Kalat became land locked and reduced to a fraction of its size. Thus Ahmed Yar Khan was forced to sign the instrument of accession on 27 March 1948, which immediately led to the brother of the Khan, Prince Abdul Karim raising the banner of revolt in July 1948, starting the first of the Baloch insurgencies."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Harrison |first=Selig S. |authorlink=Selig S. Harrison |title=In Afghanistan's Shadow: Baluch Nationalism and Soviet Temptations |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LLnCAAAAIAAJ |year=1981 |publisher=Carnegie Endowment for International Peace |ISBN=978-0-87003-029-1 |ref={{sfnref|Selig Harrison, In Afghanistan's Shadow|1981}} |p=24}}: "Pakistani leaders summarily rejected this declaration, touching off a nine-month diplomatic tug of war that came to a climax in the forcible annexation of Kalat.... it is clear that Baluch leaders, including the Khan, were bitterly opposed to what happened."&lt;/ref&gt;

As per the terms of accession, the erstwhile Indian princes received [[Privy Purse in India|privy purses]] (government allowances), and initially retained their statuses, privileges, and autonomy in internal matters during a transitional period which lasted until 1956. During this time, the former princely states were merged into unions, each of which was headed by a former ruling prince with the title of ''Rajpramukh'' (ruling chief), equivalent to a state governor.&lt;ref&gt;Wilhelm von Pochhammer, ''India's road to nationhood: a political history of the subcontinent'' (1981) ch 57&lt;/ref&gt; In 1956, the position of ''Rajpramukh'' was abolished and the federations dissolved, the former principalities becoming part of Indian states. The states which acceded to Pakistan retained their status until the promulgation of a new constitution in 1956, when most became part of the province of [[West Pakistan]]; a few of the former states retained their autonomy until 1969 when they were fully integrated into Pakistan. The Indian Government formally derecognised the princely families in 1971, followed by the Government of Pakistan in 1972.

==History==
Though principalities and chiefdoms existed on the Indian subcontinent from at least the [[Iron Age]], the history of princely states on the Indian subcontinent dates to at least the 5th–6th centuries C.E., during the rise of the [[middle kingdoms of India]] following the collapse of the [[Gupta Empire]].&lt;ref name="aa"&gt;Agarwal, Ashvini (1989). ''Rise and Fall of the Imperial Guptas'', Delhi:Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|81-208-0592-5}}, pp.264–9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Rene&gt;{{Cite book |last=Grousset |first=Rene |title=The Empire of the Steppes |publisher=Rutgers University Press |year=1970 |isbn=0-8135-1304-9 |pages=69}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the future ruling clan groups – notably the [[Rajputs]] – began to emerge during this period; by the 13th–14th centuries, many of the Rajput clans had firmly established semi-independent principalities in the north-west, along with several in the north-east. The widespread expansion of Islam during this time brought many principalities into tributary relations with Islamic sultanates, notably the Delhi Sultanate and [[Bahmani Sultanate]]. In the south, however, the Hindu [[Vijayanagara Empire]] remained dominant until the mid-17th century; among its tributaries was the future [[Mysore Kingdom]].

The Turco-Mongol Mughal Empire brought a majority of the existing Indian kingdoms and principalities under its suzerainty by the 17th century, beginning with its foundation in the early 16th century. The advent of [[Sikhism]] resulted in the creation of the [[Sikh Empire]] in the north by the early 18th century, by which time the Mughal Empire was in full decline. At the same time, the [[Maratha]]s carved out their own states to form the [[Maratha Empire]]. Through the 18th century, former Mughal governors formed their own independent states. In the north-west, some of those – such as Tonk – allied themselves with various groups, including the Marathas and the [[Durrani Empire]], itself formed in 1747 from a loose agglomeration of tribal chiefdoms that composed former Mughal territories. In 1768, [[Prithvi Narayan Shah]], ruler of a small principality in [[Gorkha, Nepal|Gorkha]] likewise established the [[Kingdom of Nepal]] from a federation of small states, expanding its influence over much of north-eastern India; in the south, the principalities of Hyderabad and Arcot were fully established by the 1760s, though they nominally remained vassals of the Mughal Emperor.

==British relationship with the princely states==
[[British Raj|India under the British ''Raj'']] (the "Indian Empire") consisted of two types of territory: [[British India]] and the ''Native states'' or ''Princely states''.  In its [[Interpretation Act 1889]], the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|British Parliament]] adopted the following definitions:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
(4.) The expression "British India" shall mean all territories and places within Her Majesty's dominions which are for the time being governed by Her Majesty through the Governor-General of India or through any governor or other officer subordinate to the Governor-General of India.&lt;br /&gt;
(5.) The expression "India" shall mean British India together with any territories of any native prince or chief under the suzerainty of Her Majesty exercised through the Governor-General of India, or through any governor or other officer subordinate to the Governor-General of India.&lt;ref&gt;Interpretation Act 1889 (52 &amp; 53 Vict. c. 63), s. 18&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In general the term "[[British India]]" had been used (and is still used) also to refer to the regions under [[Company rule in India|the rule of the East India Company]] in India from 1774 to 1858.&lt;ref&gt;'''1.''' ''Imperial Gazetteer of India, volume IV, published under the authority of the [[India Office|Secretary of State for India-in-Council]]'', 1909, Oxford University Press. page 5. Quote: "The history of British India falls, as observed by Sir C. P. Ilbert in his ''Government of India'', into three periods.  From the beginning of the seventeenth century to the middle of the eighteenth century the East India Company is a trading corporation, existing on the sufferance of the native powers and in rivalry with the merchant companies of Holland and France.  During the next century the Company acquires and consolidates its dominion, shares its sovereignty in increasing proportions with the Crown, and gradually loses its mercantile privileges and functions.  After the mutiny of 1857 the remaining powers of the Company are transferred to the Crown, and then follows an era of peace in which India awakens to new life and progress." '''2.'''

The [[British Crown]]'s suzerainty over 175 princely states, generally the largest and most important, was exercised in the name of the British Crown by the central government of British India under the Viceroy; the remaining approximately 400 states were influenced by Agents answerable to the provincial governments of British India under a Governor, Lieutenant-Governor, or Chief Commissioner.&lt;ref name=igi-60&gt;{{Harvnb|Imperial Gazetteer of India vol. IV|1907|p=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; A clear distinction between "dominion" and "suzerainty" was supplied by the jurisdiction of the courts of law: the law of British India rested upon the legislation enacted by the British Parliament, and the legislative powers those laws vested in the various governments of British India, both central and local; in contrast, the courts of the princely states existed under the authority of the respective rulers of those states.&lt;ref name=igi-60/&gt;

==Princely status and titles==
[[File:Sayajirao Gaekwad III, Maharaja of Baroda, 1919.jpg|thumb|[[Sayajirao Gaekwad III|His Highness Sayajirao Gaekwad III Sena Khas Khel Shamsher Bahadur GCSI, GCIE, KIH (21-gun salute) – the Maratha Maharaja of Baroda]]]]

The Indian rulers bore various titles – including [[Chhatrapati]] (exclusively used by the 3 [[Bhonsle]] dynasty of the [[Maratha]]s) ("emperor"), [[Maharaja]] or [[Raja]] ("king"), [[Sultan]], [[Nawab]], [[Emir]],  [[Raje]], [[Nizam]], [[Wadiyar dynasty|Wadiyar]] (by the Maharajas of [[Mysore]]), Agniraj Maharaj for the rulers of [[Bhaddaiyan Raj]], [[Chogyal]], [[Nawab]] ("governor"), Nayak, [[Wāli]], [[Inamdar (feudal title)|Inamdar]],&lt;ref name="CommissionSimon1930"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Great Britain.

Chitaley}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many others. Whatever the literal meaning and traditional prestige of the ruler's actual title, the British government translated them all as "prince," to avoid the implication that the native rulers could be "kings" with status equal to that of the British monarch.
[[File:British Residency in Kollam.jpg|right|thumb|An old image of the [[British Residency]] in the city of [[Quilon]], [[Kerala]]]]

More prestigious Hindu rulers (mostly existing before the Mughal Empire, or having split from such old states) often used the title "[[Raja]],"[[Raje]]" or a variant such as  [[Rai (title)|Rai]], "Rana," "Rao," "Rawat" or [[Rawal]]. Also in this 'class' were several [[Thakur (Indian title)|Thakurs or Thai ores]] and a few particular titles, such as [[Sardar]], [[Mankari]] (or Mānkari/Maankari), [[Deshmukh]], [[Sar Desai]], Raja Inamdar, [[Saranjamdar]].

The most prestigious Hindu rulers usually had the prefix "maha" ("great", compare for example Grand Duke) in their titles, as in ''Maharaja, Maharana, Maharao'', etc. The states of [[Travancore]] and [[Cochin]] had [[queen regnant|queens regnant]] styled [[Maharani]], generally the female forms applied only to sisters, spouses and widows, who could however act as [[regent]]s.

There were also compound titles, such as (Maha)rajadhiraj, Raj-i-rajgan, often relics from an elaborate system of hierarchical titles under the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal emperors]]. For example, the addition of the adjective ''Bahadur'' raised the status of the titleholder one level.

Furthermore, most dynasties used a variety of additional titles, such as [[Varma (name)|Varma]] in South India. This should not be confused with various titles and suffixes not specific to princes but used by entire (sub)castes.

The '''[[Sikh]] princes''' concentrated at [[Punjab region|Punjab]] usually adopted Hindu type titles when attaining princely rank; at a lower level [[Sardar]] was used.

'''[[Muslim]] rulers''' almost all used the title "[[Nawab]]" (the Arabic honorific of ''naib'', "deputy," used of the Mughal governors, who became de facto autonomous with the decline of the Mughal Empire), with the prominent exceptions of the [[Nizam]] of [[Hyderabad &amp; Berar]], the [[Wāli]]/[[Khan (title)|Khan]] of [[Kalat (princely state)|Kalat]] and the [[Wāli of Swat]].
Other less usual titles included [[Darbar (title)|Darbar Sahib]], [[Dewan]], Jam, [[Chitral (princely state)|Mehtar]] (unique to [[Chitral (princely state)|Chitral]]) and Mir (from [[Emir]]).

==Precedence and prestige==
However, the actual importance of a princely state cannot be read from the title of its ruler, which was usually ''granted'' (or at least recognised) as a favour, often in recognition for loyalty and services rendered to the [[Mughal Empire]].  Although some titles were raised once or even repeatedly, there was no automatic updating when a state gained or lost real power. In fact, princely titles were even awarded to holders of domains (mainly [[jagir]]s) and even [[taluqar]]s and [[zamindar]]s (tax collectors), which were not states at all. Various sources give significantly different numbers of states and domains of the various types. Even in general, the definition of titles and domains are clearly not well-established.

In addition to their titles all princely rulers were eligible to be appointed to certain British orders of chivalry associated with India, the [[Order of the Star of India|Most Exalted Order of the Star of India]] and the [[Order of the Indian Empire|Most Eminent Order of the Indian Empire]]. Women could be appointed as "Knights" (instead of Dames) of these orders. Rulers entitled to 21-gun and 19-gun salutes were normally appointed to the highest rank, Knight Grand Commander of the Order of the Star of India.

Many Indian princes served in the [[British Army]], the [[British Indian Army|Indian Army]], or in local guard or police forces, often rising to high ranks; some even served while on the throne. Many of these were appointed as an [[Aide de camp]], either to the ruling prince of their own house (in the case of relatives of such rulers) or indeed to the British King-Emperor. Many saw [[active service]], both on the subcontinent and on other fronts, during both World Wars.

Apart from those members of the princely houses who entered military service and who distinguished themselves, a good number of princes received honorary ranks as officers in the British and Indian Armed Forces. Those ranks were conferred based on several factors, including their heritage, lineage, gun-salute (or lack of one) as well as personal character or martial traditions. After the First and Second World Wars, the princely rulers of several of the major states, including Gwalior, [[Patiala State|Patiala]], [[Bikaner State|Bikaner]], [[Jaipur State|Jaipur]], [[Jodhpur State|Jodhpur]], [[Kashmir and Jammu (princely state)|Jammu and Kashmir]] and Hyderabad, were given honorary general officer ranks as a result of their states' contributions to the war effort.
* Lieutenant/Captain/Flight Lieutenant or Lieutenant-Commander/Major/Squadron Leader (for junior members of princely houses or for minor princes)
* Commander/Lieutenant-Colonel/Wing Commander or Captain/Colonel/Group Captain (granted to princes of salute states, often to those entitled to 15-guns or more)
* Commodore/Brigadier/Air Commodore (conferred upon princes of salute states entitled to gun salutes of 15-guns or more)
* Major-General/Air Vice-Marshal (conferred upon princes of salute states entitled to 15-guns or more; conferred upon rulers of the major princely states, including Baroda, [[Kapurthala State|Kapurthala]], Travancore, [[Bhopal State|Bhopal]] and [[Mysore Kingdom|Mysore]])
* Lieutenant-General (conferred upon the rulers of the largest and most prominent princely houses after the First and Second World Wars for their states' contributions to the war effort.)
* General (very rarely awarded; the Maharajas of Gwalior and Jammu &amp; Kashmir were created honorary Generals in the British Army in 1877, the Maharaja of Bikaner was made one in 1937, and the Nizam of Hyderabad in 1941)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.royalark.net/India/salute.htm Royalark.net: "Salute States"]&lt;/ref&gt;

It was also not unusual for members of princely houses to be appointed to various colonial offices, often far from their native state, or to enter the diplomatic corps.

===Salute states===
{{main|Salute state}}

The [[gun salute]] system was used to set unambiguously the precedence of the major rulers in the area in which the British East India Company was active, or generally of the states and their dynasties. As heads of a state, certain princely rulers were entitled to be saluted by the firing of an odd number of guns between three and 21, with a greater number of guns indicating greater prestige. Generally, the number of guns remained the same for all successive rulers of a particular state, but individual princes were sometimes granted additional guns on a personal basis. Furthermore, rulers were sometimes granted additional gun salutes within their own territories only, constituting a semi-promotion. The states of all these rulers (about 120) were known as [[salute states]].

After [[Partition of India|Indian Independence]], the Maharana of [[Udaipur State|Udaipur]] displaced the [[Nizam]] of Hyderabad as the most senior prince in India, because [[Hyderabad State]] had not acceded to the new [[Dominion of India]], and the style ''Highness'' was extended to all rulers entitled to 9-gun salutes. When the princely states had been integrated into the [[Indian Union]] their rulers were promised continued privileges and an income (known as the [[Privy Purse in India|Privy Purse]]) for their upkeep. Subsequently, when the Indian government abolished the Privy Purse in 1971, the whole princely order ceased to be recognised under Indian law, although many families continue to retain their social prestige informally; some descendants of the rulers are still prominent in regional or national politics, diplomacy, business and high society.

At the time of Indian independence, only five rulers – the [[Nizam]] of [[Hyderabad State|Hyderabad]], the Maharaja of [[Kingdom of Mysore|Mysore]], the Maharaja of [[Kashmir and Jammu (princely state)|Jammu and Kashmir state]], the Maharaja [[Gaekwad]] of [[Baroda State|Baroda]] and the Maharaja [[Scindia]] of [[Gwalior State|Gwalior]] – were entitled to a 21-gun salute. Five more – the Nawab of [[Bhopal State|Bhopal]], the [[Holkar|Maharaja Holkar]] of [[Indore State|Indore]], the Maharana of [[Udaipur State|Udaipur]], the Maharaja of [[Kolhapur State|Kolhapur]] and the Maharaja of [[Travancore]] – were entitled to 19-gun salutes.  The most senior princely ruler was the [[Nizam of Hyderabad]], who was entitled to the unique style ''[[Exalted Highness]]'' and [[21-gun salute]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=King of all rewinds |url=https://www.theweek.in/theweek/cover/king-of-all-rewinds.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=SALUTE STATES |url=https://www.royalark.net/India/salute.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other princely rulers entitled to salutes of 11 guns (soon 9 guns too) or more were entitled to the style ''Highness''. No special style was used by rulers entitled to lesser gun salutes.

As ''paramount ruler'', and successor to the Mughals, the British ''[[King-Emperor]]'' of India, for whom the style of [[Majesty]] was reserved, was entitled to an 'imperial' 101-gun salute—in the European tradition also the number of guns fired to announce the birth of an heir (male) to the throne.

===Non-salute states===
There was no strict correlation between the levels of the titles and the classes of gun salutes, the real measure of precedence, but merely a growing percentage of higher titles in classes with more guns.
As a rule the majority of gun-salute princes had at least nine, with numbers below that usually the prerogative of Arab Sheikhs of the [[Aden protectorate]], also under British protection.

There were many so-called non-salute states of lower prestige. Since the total of salute states was 117 and there were more than 500 princely states, most rulers were not entitled to any gun salute. Not all of these were minor rulers – [[Surguja State]], for example, was both larger and more populous than [[Karauli State]], but the Maharaja of Karauli was entitled to a 17-gun salute and the Maharaja of Surguja was not entitled to any gun salute at all.

A number of princes, in the broadest sense of the term, were not even acknowledged as such.{{example needed|?}}  On the other hand, the dynasties of certain defunct states were allowed to keep their princely status – they were known as [[political pensioner]]s, such as the Nawab of [[Oudh]]. There were also certain estates of British India which were rendered as [[political saranjam]]s, having equal princely status.&lt;ref name="Patel1957"&gt;{{cite book|author=Govindlal Dalsukhbhai Patel|title=The land problem of reorganized Bombay state|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XvQCAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=9 June 2012|year=1957|publisher=N. M. Tripathi}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though none of these princes were awarded gun salutes, princely titles in this category were recognised as a form of [[vassal state|vassals]] of salute states, and were not even in direct relation with the paramount power.

==Doctrine of lapse==
{{Main|Doctrine of lapse}}

A controversial aspect of East India Company rule was the [[doctrine of lapse]], a policy under which lands whose feudal ruler died (or otherwise became unfit to rule) without a male biological heir (as opposed to an adopted son) would become directly controlled by the Company and an adopted son would not become the ruler of the princely state. This policy went counter to Indian tradition where, unlike Europe, it was far more the accepted norm for a ruler to appoint his own heir.

The doctrine of lapse was pursued most vigorously by the Governor-General [[James Andrew Broun-Ramsay, 1st Marquess of Dalhousie|Sir James Ramsay]], 10th Earl (later 1st Marquess) of [[Earl of Dalhousie|Dalhousie]]. Dalhousie annexed seven states, including [[Awadh]] (Oudh), whose Nawabs he had accused of misrule, and the [[Maratha]] states of [[Nagpur]], [[Jhansi]] and [[Satara State|Satara]] and [[Sambalpur]] and [[Thanjavur]]. Resentment over the annexation of these states turned to indignation when the heirlooms of the Maharajas of Nagpur were auctioned off in Calcutta. Dalhousie's actions contributed to the rising discontent amongst the upper castes which played a large part in the outbreak of the [[Indian mutiny of 1857]]. The last Mughal Badshah (emperor), whom many of the mutineers saw as a figurehead to rally around, was deposed following its suppression.

In response to the unpopularity of the doctrine, it was discontinued with the end of Company rule and the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|British Parliament]]'s assumption of direct power over India.

==Imperial governance==
{{Main|Agencies of British India|Residencies of British India}}
[[File:Group at Residency including the Maharaja of Kolhapur.jpg|thumb|Photograph (1894) of the 19-year-old [[Shahaji II|Shahaji II Bhonsle]] Maharajah of [[Kolhapur (princely state)|Kolhapur]] visiting the British resident and his staff at the Residency]]

By treaty, the British controlled the external affairs of the princely states absolutely. As the states were not British possessions, they retained control over their own internal affairs, subject to a degree of British influence which in many states was substantial.

By the beginning of the 20th century, relations between the British and the four largest states – [[Hyderabad State|Hyderabad]], [[Kingdom of Mysore|Mysore]], Jammu and Kashmir, and [[Baroda State|Baroda]] – were directly under the control of the [[Governor-General of India]], in the person of a British [[resident (title)|Resident]]. Two agencies, for [[Rajputana]] and [[Central India Agency|Central India]], oversaw twenty and 148 princely states respectively. The remaining princely states had their own British political officers, or Agents, who answered to the administrators of India's provinces. The Agents of five princely states were then under the authority of [[Madras Presidency|Madras]], 354 under [[Bombay Presidency|Bombay]], 26 of [[Bengal Presidency|Bengal]], two under [[Assam]], 34 under [[Punjab (British India)|Punjab]], fifteen under [[Central Provinces and Berar]] and two under [[Uttar Pradesh|United Provinces]].
[[File:Chamber of Princes 17-03-1941 detail.png|thumb|Chamber of Princes meeting in March 1941]]
The [[Chamber of Princes]] (''Narender Mandal'' or ''Narendra Mandal'') was an institution established in 1920 by a [[Royal Proclamation]] of the [[George V of the United Kingdom|King-Emperor]] to provide a forum in which the rulers could voice their needs and aspirations to the government. It survived until the end of the [[British Raj]] in 1947.&lt;ref&gt;Vapal Pangunni Menon (1956) ''The Story of the Integration of the Indian States'', Macmillan Co., pp. 17–19&lt;/ref&gt;

By the early 1930s, most of the princely states whose Agencies were under the authority of India's provinces were organised into new Agencies, answerable directly to the Governor-general, on the model of the Central India and Rajputana agencies: the [[Eastern States Agency]], [[Punjab States Agency]], [[Baluchistan Agency]], [[Deccan States Agency]], [[Madras States Agency]] and the [[Northwest Frontier States Agency]]. The [[Baroda Residency]] was combined with the princely states of northern Bombay Presidency into the [[Baroda, Western India and Gujarat States Agency]]. [[Gwalior]] was separated from the Central India Agency and given its own Resident, and the states of [[Rampur, Uttar Pradesh|Rampur]] and [[Benares]], formerly with Agents under the authority of the United Provinces, were placed under the [[Gwalior Residency]] in 1936. The princely states of [[Sandur, India|Sandur]] and [[Banganapalle]] in Mysore Presidency were transferred to the agency of the Mysore Resident in 1939.

==Principal princely states in 1947==
The native states in 1947 included five large states that were in "direct political relations" with the Government of India. For the complete list of princely states in 1947, see [[List of princely states of India]].

==State military forces==
''See article: [[Indian State Forces]]''

The armies of the [[Native States]] were bound by many restrictions that were imposed by [[subsidiary alliance]]s. They existed mainly for ceremonial use and for internal policing, although certain units designated as Imperial Service Troops, were available for service alongside the regular Indian Army upon request by the British government.&lt;ref&gt;Lt. Gen. Sir George MacMunn, page 198 "The Armies of India", {{ISBN|0-947554-02-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the {{Harvnb|Imperial Gazetteer of India vol. IV|1907|p=85}}, &lt;blockquote&gt;Since a chief can neither attack his neighbour nor fall out with a foreign nation, it follows that he needs no military establishment which is not required either for police purposes or personal display, or for cooperation with the Imperial Government.  The treaty made with Gwalior in 1844, and the instrument of transfer given to Mysore in 1881, alike base the restriction of the forces of the State upon the broad ground of protection.  The former explained in detail that unnecessary armies were embarrassing to the State itself and the cause of disquietude to others: a few months later a striking proof of this was afforded by the army of the Sikh kingdom of Lahore.  The British Government has undertaken to protect the dominions of the Native princes from invasion and even from rebellion within: its army is organised for the defence not merely of [[British India]], but of all the possessions under the [[suzerainty]] of the King-Emperor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Imperial Gazetteer of India vol. IV|1907|p=85}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In addition, other restrictions were imposed:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The treaties with most of the larger [[Native States|States]] are clear on this point.  Posts in the interior must not be fortified, factories for the production of guns and ammunition must not be constructed, nor may the subject of other States be enlisted in the local forces. ... They must allow the forces that defend them to obtain local supplies, to occupy cantonments or positions, and to arrest deserters; and in addition to these services they must recognise the [[British Empire|Imperial]] control of the railways, telegraphs, and postal communications as essential not only to the common welfare but to the common defence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Imperial Gazetteer of India vol. IV|1907|pp=85–86}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Imperial Service Troops were routinely inspected by British army officers and generally had the same equipment as soldiers in the Indian Army.&lt;ref name=IGI-4-87&gt;{{Harvnb|Imperial Gazetteer of India vol. IV|1907|p=87}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although their numbers were relatively small, the Imperial Service Troops were employed in China and [[British Somaliland]] in the first decade of the 20th century, and later saw action in the [[First World War]] and [[Second World War]] .&lt;ref name=IGI-4-87/&gt;

At the time of [[Partition of India|Indian independence]] in August 1947, [[India]] was divided into two sets of territories, the first being the territories of "[[British India]]," which were under the direct control of the [[India Office]] in London and the [[Governor-General of India]], and the second being the "[[Princely states]]," the territories over which [[the Crown]] had [[suzerainty]], but which were under the control of their hereditary rulers. In addition, there were several colonial enclaves controlled by France and [[Portugal]]. The integration of these territories into [[Dominion of India]], that had been created by the Indian Independence Act 1947 by the British parliament, was a declared objective of the [[Indian National Congress]], which the [[Government of India]] pursued over the years 1947 to 1949. Through a combination of tactics, [[Sardar]] [[Vallabhbhai Patel]] and [[V. P. Menon]] in the months immediately preceding and following the independence convinced the rulers of almost all of the hundreds of [[princely states]] to accede to India. In a speech in January 1948, Vallabhbhai Patel said:

{{quote|As you are all aware, on the lapse of Paramountcy every Indian State became a separate independent entity and our first task of consolidating about 550 States was on the basis of accession to the Indian Dominion on three subjects. Barring Hyderabad and Junagadh all the states which are contiguous to India acceded to Indian Dominion. Subsequently, Kashmir also came in... Some Rulers who were quick to read the writing on the wall, gave responsible government to their people; Cochin being the most illustrious example. In Travancore, there was a short struggle, but there, too, the Ruler soon recognised the aspiration of his people and agreed to introduce a constitution in which all powers would be transferred to the people and he would function as a constitutional Ruler.&lt;ref&gt;R. P. Bhargava (1992) ''The Chamber of Princes'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=BAQgNE1uSEgC&amp;pg=PA313#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 313]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Although this process successfully integrated the vast majority of princely states into India, it was not as successful in relation to a few states, notably the former princely state of [[Kashmir and Jammu (princely state)|Kashmir]], whose Maharaja delayed signing the instrument of accession into India until his territories were under the threat of invasion by Pakistan, the state of [[Hyderabad State|Hyderabad]], whose ruler decided to remain independent and was subsequently defeated by the [[Operation Polo]] invasion.

Having secured their accession, Sardar Patel and V. P. Menon then proceeded, in a step-by-step process, to secure and extend the central government's authority over these states and to transform their administrations until, by 1956, there was little difference between the territories that had formerly been part of British India and those that had been princely states. Simultaneously, the Government of India, through a combination of diplomatic and military means, acquired control over the remaining European colonial enclaves, such as [[Goa]], which were also integrated into India.

As the final step, in 1971, the 26th amendment&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://indiacode.nic.in/coiweb/amend/amend26.htm|title=The Constitution (26 Amendment) Act, 1971|publisher=Government of India|work=indiacode.nic.in|year=1971|accessdate=9 November 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111206041333/http://indiacode.nic.in/coiweb/amend/amend26.htm|archive-date=6 December 2011|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the [[Constitution of India]] withdrew official recognition of all official symbols of princely India, including titles and privileges, and abolished the remuneration of the princes by [[Privy Purse in India|privy purses]].

{{Other uses}}

A '''province''' is almost always an [[administrative division]] within a [[country]] or [[sovereign state|state]]. The term derives from the [[ancient Roman]] ''[[Roman province|provincia]]'', which was the major territorial and administrative unit of the [[Roman Empire|Roman Empire's]] territorial possessions outside [[Roman Italy|Italy]]. The term ''province'' has since been adopted by many countries. In some countries with no actual provinces, "the provinces" is a metaphorical term meaning "outside the [[capital city]]".

While some provinces were produced artificially by [[Colonialism|colonial powers]], others were formed around local groups with their own ethnic identities. Many have their own powers independent of central or [[Federation|federal]] authority, especially [[Provinces of Canada|in Canada]]. In other countries, [[Provinces of China|like China]], provinces are the creation of central government, with very little autonomy.

==Etymology==
The [[English language|English]] word "province" is attested since about 1330 and derives from the 13th-century [[Old French]] "''province''{{-"}}, which itself comes from the [[Latin]] word "''provincia''{{-"}}, which referred to the sphere of authority of a [[magistrate]]; in particular, to a foreign territory.

A [[popular etymology]] is from [[Latin]]"''pro-''{{-"}} ("on behalf of") and "''vincere''{{-"}} ("to triumph" or "to take control of"). Thus a "province" would be a territory or function that a [[Roman Magistrates|Roman magistrate]] held control of on behalf of his government. In fact, the word Province is an ancient term from public law, which means: "office belonging to a magistrate". This agrees with the Latin term's earlier usage as a generic term for a jurisdiction under [[Roman law]].

==History and culture==
It was first used in Iran and In [[France]], the expression "''en province''{{-"}} still tends to mean "outside the [[Paris]] region". Equivalent expressions are used in [[Peru]] ("''en provincias''{{-"}}, "outside the city of [[Lima]]"), [[Mexico]] ("''la provincia''{{-"}}, "lands outside [[Mexico City]]"), [[Romania]] ("''în provincie''{{-"}}, "outside the [[Bucharest]] region"), [[Poland]] ("''prowincjonalny''{{-"}}, "provincial"), [[Bulgaria]] ("''в провинцията''{{-"}}, "''v provintsiyata''{{-"}}, "in the provinces"; "''провинциален''{{-"}}, "''provintsialen''{{-"}}, "provincial") and the [[Philippines]] (''taga-probinsiya'', "from outside [[Metro Manila]]", ''sa probinsiya'', "in the provinces"). Similarly, in Australia "provincial" refers to parts of a state outside of the state capital.

Before the [[French Revolution]], France comprised a variety of jurisdictions (e.g., [[Île-de-France]], built around the early [[House of Capet|Capetian]] royal [[demesne]]), some being considered "provinces", though the term was also used colloquially for territories as small as a [[Manorialism|manor]] (''[[châtellenie]]''). Most commonly referred to as "provinces", however, were the ''Grands Gouvernements'', generally former medieval feudal principalities, or agglomerations of such. Today the expression "''province''{{-"}} is sometimes replaced by "''en région''{{-"}}, "''région''{{-"}} now being the term officially used for the secondary level of government.

In [[Italy]], "''in provincia''{{-"}} generally means "outside the biggest regional capitals" (like [[Rome]], [[Milan]], [[Naples]], etc.).
 
The historic European provinces—built up of many small regions, called "''pays''{{-"}} by the French and "[[Swiss canton|cantons]]" by the Swiss, each with a local cultural identity and focused upon a [[market town]]—have been depicted by [[Fernand Braudel]] as the optimum-size political unit in pre-industrial [[Early Modern Europe]]. He asks, "Was the province not its inhabitants' true '[[fatherland]]'?"&lt;ref&gt;''The Perspective of the World'', 1984, p. 284.&lt;/ref&gt; Even centrally-organized France, an early [[nation-state]], could collapse into autonomous provincial worlds under pressure, as during the sustained crisis of the [[French Wars of Religion]] (1562–98).
 
The British colonies in North America were often named provinces. Most (but not all) of the [[thirteen colonies]] that eventually formed the United States were called provinces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.loc.gov/resource/g3800.ar107003/|publisher=Library of Congress|title=A chorographical map of the Province of New-York in North America, divided into counties, manors, patents and townships; exhibiting likewise all the private grants of land made and located in that Province|accessdate=December 4, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; All declared themselves "states" when they became independent. The [[Connecticut Colony]], the [[Delaware Colony]], [[Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations|Rhode Island]] and the [[Colony of Virginia]] never used the title "province". The British colonies further north, which remained loyal to Britain and later [[Canadian Confederation|confederated]] to form the original [[Canada]], retained the title  of "province" and are still known as such to the present day. At the time of confederation, only the [[United Province of Canada]] was called a province, although the provinces of [[Lower Canada]] and [[Upper Canada]] had previously existed. Other colonies only started to use the name "province" on becoming constituent provinces of the Canadian confederation.

To 19th- and 20th-century historians, in Europe, [[centralized government]] was a sign of modernity and political maturity. In the late 20th century, as the [[European Union]] drew [[nation-state]]s closer together, centripetal forces seemed simultaneously to move countries toward more flexible systems of more localized, provincial governing entities under the overall European Union umbrella. [[Spain]] after [[Francisco Franco]] has been a "State of Autonomies", formally unitary but in fact functioning as a federation of [[Autonomous Communities of Spain|Autonomous Communities]], each exercising different powers. (See [[Politics of Spain]].)

While [[Serbia]], the rump of former [[Yugoslavia]], fought the separatists in the province of [[Kosovo]], the [[United Kingdom]], under the political principle of "[[devolution]]", produced (1998) local [[parliament]]s in [[Scotland]], [[Wales]] and [[Northern Ireland]]. Strong local [[nationalism]]s have surfaced or developed in Britain's [[Cornwall]], France's [[Brittany]], [[Languedoc]] and [[Corsica]], Spain's [[Catalonia]] and [[the Basque Country]], Italy's [[Lombardy]], Belgium's [[Flanders]]; and, east of Europe, in [[Abkhazia]], [[Chechnya]] and [[Kurdistan]]. In [[ancient India]], unlike the [[Maurya Empire|Mauryas]], the [[Gupta Empire]] gave local areas a great deal of independence and divided the empire into 26 large provinces, styled as Bhukti, Pradesha and Bhoga.

==Legal aspects==
In many [[federation]]s and [[confederation]]s, the province or state is not clearly subordinate to the national or central government. Rather, it is considered to be [[sovereignty|sovereign]] in regard to its particular set of constitutional functions. The central- and provincial-government functions, or areas of jurisdiction, are identified in a [[constitution]]. Those that are not specifically identified are called "residual powers." In a decentralized federal system (such as the [[United States]] and [[Australia]]) these residual powers lie at the provincial or state level, whereas in a centralized federal system (such as [[Canada]]) they are retained at the federal level.

Some of the [[enumerated power]]s can be quite important. For example, [[Provinces and territories of Canada|Canadian provinces]] are sovereign in regard to such important matters as [[property]], [[civil rights]], [[education]], [[social welfare]] and [[medical services]]. The growth of the modern [[welfare state]] has resulted in these functions, [[Section 92 of the Constitution Act, 1867|assigned to the provinces]], becoming more important compared to those [[Section 91 of the Constitution Act, 1867|assigned to the federal government]] and thus provincial governments have become more important than the [[Fathers of Confederation]] originally intended.

Canada's status as a federation of provinces under the [[Dominion]] of the British Empire rather than an independent country also had certain legal implications. [[History of the Supreme Court of Canada|Provinces could appeal court rulings]] over the heads of the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] to the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]] in [[London]]. As well, provinces could bypass the Supreme Court and go directly to London from any [[Provincial Court]]. The Canadian Supreme Court tended to support the view that the [[Canadian Constitution]] was intended to create a powerful central government, but the Privy Council in London held a distinctly opposite view that the Constitution provided for stronger provincial powers. This provided an opportunity for [[forum shopping]] for provinces who opposed federal laws. Until appeals from Canada to the Privy Council were abolished in 1949, in legal disputes the provincial governments tended to win powers at the expense of the federal government.

In addition, while the Canadian federal government has unlimited taxing power while province governments are restricted to imposing [[direct taxes]], the Canadian government introduced an [[income tax]] during [[World War I]], and since it is a direct tax it also became a major revenue generator for provinces. In most provinces, the federal government now collects income tax for both levels of government and transfers to the provincial governments whatever surcharge they ask for. The [[sales tax]] also become a major revenue generator for provinces, so in 1991 the Canadian government introduced a [[Goods and Services Tax (Canada)|Goods and Services Tax]] (GST) to share the revenues, which proved unpopular both with provincial governments and taxpayers. The Canadian government has tried to harmonize the two levels of sales taxes, but three provinces continue to impose a separate sales tax (British Columbia after harmonizing it, and shortly thereafter de-harmonizing it after it was struck down by a referendum), while the province of Alberta still does not impose a provincial sales tax.

The evolution of federations has created an inevitable tug-of-war between concepts of federal supremacy versus states' &amp; provinces' rights. The historic division of responsibility in federal constitutions is inevitably subject to multiple overlaps. For example, when central governments, responsible for [[foreign policy]], enter into international agreements in areas where the state or province is sovereign, such as the environment or health standards, agreements made at the national level can create jurisdictional overlap and conflicting laws. This overlap creates the potential for [[internal dispute]]s that lead to [[constitutional amendment]]s and judicial decisions that alter the balance of powers.

Though foreign affairs do not usually fall under a province’s or a federal state’s competency, some states allow them to legally conduct international relations on their own in matters of their constitutional prerogative and essential interest. Sub-national authorities have a growing interest in [[paradiplomacy]], be it performed under a legal framework or as a trend informally admitted as legitimate by the central authorities.

In [[unitary state]]s such as [[France]] and [[China]], provinces are subordinate to the national, central government. In theory, the central government can create or abolish provinces within its jurisdiction. On the other hand, although Canada is now considered a [[federation|federal state]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.parl.gc.ca/sites/lop/aboutparliament/forsey/fed_state_01-e.asp |title=How Canadians Govern Themselves,. 7th ed |publisher=.parl.gc.ca |accessdate=May 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and not a [[confederation]], in practice it is among the world's more [[decentralization|decentralized]] federations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pco-bcp.gc.ca/aia/index.asp?lang=eng&amp;Page=archive&amp;Sub=speeches-discours&amp;Doc=19990422-eng.htm |title=Collaborative Federalism in an era of globalization |publisher=Pco-bcp.gc.ca |date=April 22, 1999 |accessdate=May 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Canadian Confederation]] and the [[Constitution Act, 1867]] conferred considerable power on the provincial governments which they often use to pursue their own goals independently of the federal government.

In Canada, local governments have been called "creatures of the province" because the authority of a local government derives solely from the provincial government. Provinces can create, merge, and dissolve local governments without the consent of the federal government or the people in the affected locality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://portal.publicpolicy.utoronto.ca/EN/CONCEPTSANDTERMS/KLM/MUNICIPALITIESASCREATURESOFPROVINCES/Pages/default.aspx| title=Municipalities as creatures of the provinces}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alberta in particular dissolved and merged [[List of municipal districts in Alberta|hundreds of local governments]] during the 1940s and 1950s as a consequence of the [[Great Depression]]. Other provinces have arbitrarily merged and annexed independent suburbs to major Canadian cities such as [[Toronto]] or [[Montreal]] without the approval of local voters.

== Current provinces ==
{{see also|Administrative divisions}}
Not all first-level political entities are termed "provinces." In [[Arab]] countries, the first administrative level of government—called a ''muhafazah''—is usually translated as a "[[governorate]]." In [[Poland]], the equivalent of "province" is "''[[Voivodeships of Poland|województwo]]''," sometimes rendered in English as "[[voivodeship]]."&lt;ref&gt;Also spelled "voivodship," "voi'''''e'''''vodship," "voi'''''e'''''vod'''''e'''''ship".&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, [[New Zealand]] was divided into [[Provinces of New Zealand|provinces]], each with its own Superintendent and Provincial Council, and with considerable responsibilities conferred on them.  However, the colony (as it then was) never developed into a federation; instead, the provinces were abolished in 1876. The old provincial boundaries continue to be used to determine the application of certain [[public holiday]]s. Over the years, when the central Government has created special-purpose agencies at a sub-national level, these have often tended to follow or approximate the old provincial boundaries. Current examples include the 16 [[Regions of New Zealand|Regions]] into which New Zealand is divided, and also the 21 District Health Boards. Sometimes the term ''the provinces'' is used to refer collectively to rural and regional parts of New Zealand, that is, those parts of the country lying outside some or all of the "main centres"—[[Auckland]], [[Wellington]], [[Christchurch]], [[Hamilton, New Zealand|Hamilton]] and [[Dunedin]].

===Modern provinces===
In many countries, a province is a relatively small non-constituent level of sub-national government, such as a [[Counties of the United Kingdom|county in the United Kingdom]]. In China, a province is a sub-national region within a unitary state; this means that a province can be created or abolished by the central government.

In some nations, a province (or its equivalent) is a first-level administrative unit of sub-national government—as in the [[Netherlands#Administrative divisions|Netherlands]]—and a large constituent autonomous area, as in [[Argentina#Provinces|Argentina]], [[#Canada|Canada]], [[South Africa#Administrative divisions|South Africa]], and the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo#Provinces|Democratic Republic of the Congo]]. It can also be a constituent element of a [[federation]], [[confederation]], or [[republic]]. For example, in the [[United States#Political divisions|United States]], no [[U.S. state|state]] may [[United States#Civil War and Reconstruction Era|secede]] from the [[federal union|federal Union]] without the permission of the [[federal government of the United States|federal government]].

In other nations—such as [[Belgium#Communities and regions|Belgium]], [[Chile#Administrative divisions|Chile]], [[Italy#Administrative divisions|Italy]], [[Peru]], the [[Philippines#Administrative divisions|Philippines]], and [[Spain#Administrative divisions|Spain]]—a province is a second-level administrative sub-division of a [[region#Political regions|region]] (which is the first-order administrative sub-division of the nation). [[Italy|Italian]] provinces are mainly named after their principal town and comprise several administrative sub-divisions called ''[[comune|comuni]]'' (communes). In Chile, they are referred to as ''[[comuna]]s''. Chile has [[regions of Chile|15 regions]], subdivided into 53 provinces, of which each is run by a governor appointed by the president. Italy has [[regions of Italy|20 regions]], subdivided into [[metropolitan cities of Italy|14 metropolitan cities]] and [[provinces of Italy|96 provinces]]. Peru has [[regions of Peru|25 regions]], subdivided into 194 provinces. Spain has [[autonomous communities of Spain|17 autonomous communities]] and 2 autonomous cities, subdivided into [[provinces of Spain|50 provinces]].

The island of [[Ireland#Politics|Ireland]] is divided into four historic provinces (see [[Provinces of Ireland]]), each of which is sub-divided into [[Counties of Ireland|counties]]. These provinces are [[Connacht]] (in the west), [[Leinster]] (in the east), [[Munster]] (in the south) and, [[Ulster]] (in the north). Nowadays these provinces have little or no administrative function, though they do have [[sport in Ireland|sporting]] significance.

From the 19th century, the [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese colonies]] were considered overseas provinces of [[Portugal]].

Similarly, some overseas parts of the [[British Empire]] bore the colonial title of "province" (in a more Roman sense), such as the [[Province of Canada]] and the [[South Australia|Province of South Australia]] (the latter, to distinguish it from the penal "colonies" elsewhere in [[Australia]]). Likewise, prior to the [[American Revolution]], most of the original [[Thirteen Colonies]] in [[British America]] were provinces as well, such as the [[Province of Georgia]] and the [[Province of New Hampshire]].

===Canada===
The constituent entities of [[Canada#Provinces and territories|Canada]] are known as provinces. At the time of confederation, only the [[United Province of Canada]], New Brunswick, and [[Nova Scotia]] were called provinces, although the provinces of [[Lower Canada]] and [[Upper Canada]] had previously existed. Other colonies and territories only started to use the title "province" on becoming constituent entities of the Canadian confederation.

Because Canada is the [[List of countries and dependencies by area|second-largest country in the world by area]], most [[Provinces and territories of Canada|Canadian provinces]] are very large—[[List of Canadian provinces and territories by area|six of its ten provinces]] are [[List of European countries by area|larger than any country in Europe]] except [[Russia]], and its largest province [[Quebec]]—{{convert|1542056|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}—is almost two and a half times as large as [[France]]—{{convert|640679|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}. Five of the older Canadian provinces—[[Ontario]], [[Quebec]], [[New Brunswick]], [[Nova Scotia]] and [[Prince Edward Island]]—have "counties" as administrative sub-divisions. The actual local government form can vary widely. Since the [[Constitution Act, 1867|Canadian Constitution]] assigns local government to provincial jurisdiction, the various provinces can create, dissolve, and reorganize local governments freely and they have been described as "creatures of the province". The [[Western provinces]] have more varied types of administrative sub-divisions than the [[Eastern Canada|Eastern provinces]] and invent new types at will. The province of [[British Columbia]] has "regional districts" which function as equivalents of counties. [[Manitoba]] and [[Saskatchewan]] have "urban municipalities", rural municipalities, and "special municipalities" or "northern municipalities". Most of [[Alberta]]'s rural municipalities brand themselves "counties", although in Alberta the word has no legal significance and does not describe the government type.

The province of Alberta has some unusually creative solutions formed in response to local conditions. For instance, [[Sherwood Park]] is an unincorporated "urban service area" of 65,465 within [[Strathcona County]], which has most of the oil refining capacity in Western Canada; [[Fort McMurray]] was once a city but dissolved itself and became an "urban service area" of 70,964 people within the [[Regional Municipality of Wood Buffalo|Regional Municipality (R.M.) of Wood Buffalo]], which has several multibillion-dollar [[oil sands]] plants; and [[Lloydminster]], a city of 31,483 which sits directly astride the provincial border between Alberta and Saskatchewan. Unlike most such cases, Lloydminster is not a pair of twin cities on opposite sides of a border, but is actually incorporated by both provinces as a single city with a single municipal administration. The residents objected to the federal government splitting the city in two when it created the two provinces, so the two provinces reunified it by declaring it to be a single city in two provinces, thereby bypassing the limitations of federal boundaries.

===Russia===
The term "province" is sometimes used to refer to the historic governorates (''[[guberniya]]s'') of [[Russia]]. This terms also refers to the ''provinces'' ({{lang|ru|провинции}}), which were introduced as the subdivisions of the governorates in 1719 and existed until 1775. In modern parlance, the term is commonly used to refer to the [[oblast]]s and [[krai]]s of Russia.

==Historic provinces==

===Ancient, medieval and feudal===
* The [[Roman Empire]] was divided into provinces (''[[Roman province|provinciae]]''); this is where the term originated
* [[Caliphate]] and subsequent [[sultanate]]s: see [[Emirate]]
* [[Khanate]] can also mean a province as well as an independent state, as either can be headed by a Khan
* [[Byzantine Empire]]: see [[exarchate]], [[Theme (Byzantine district)|thema]]
* Pharaonic [[Egypt]]: see [[nome (Egypt)]]
* Frankish (Carolingian) 're-founded' [[Holy Roman Empire]]: see [[Gau (country subdivision)|gau]] and [[county]]
* In the [[Habsburg]] territories, the traditional provinces are partly expressed in the ''Länder'' of 19th-century [[Austria-Hungary]].
* [[Mughal Empire]]: [[Subah (province)|subah]]
* The [[subdivisions of the Ottoman Empire|provinces of the Ottoman Empire]] had various types of governors (generally a [[pasha]]), but mostly styled [[wali|vali]], hence the predominant term ''[[vilayet]]'', generally subdivided (often in [[bey]]liks or [[sanjak]]s), sometimes grouped under a governor-general (styled [[beylerbey]]).
* Achaemenid [[Persia]] (and probably before in Media, again after conquest and further extension by Alexander the Great, and in the larger Hellenistic [[successor state]]s: see [[satrapy]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4010">The '''QRA locator''', also called '''QTH locator''' in some publications, is an obsolete [[geographic coordinate system]] used by amateur radio operators in Europe before the introduction of the [[Maidenhead Locator System]]. As a radio transmitter or receiver location system the QRA locator is considered defunct, but may be found in many older documents.

== History ==
The QRA locator system in the 4-character format was introduced at a meeting of the VHF Working Group in The Hague in October 1959. The QRA locator was further developed with the addition of the fifth character at the Region 1 Conference in Malmö (1963).

The QRA locator was officially adopted by [[International Amateur Radio Union|IARU]] Region 1 in 1966 and was renamed "QTH-locator" a year later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qrz.ru/vhf/qth_h.pdf|title=The Locator System|format=PDF|accessdate=2013-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
QRA locator references consist of a string of two capital letters, two numerical digits and one lower case letter, e.g. FG32c.

* The two capital letters mark an area, or ''square'', of two degrees longitude by one degree latitude, like the squares of Maidenhead Locator. The bottom left corner of square AA was at 40.0°&amp;nbsp;N - 0.0°&amp;nbsp;E.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=R. J. Eckersley, G4FTJ |title=Amateur Radio Operating Manual (third edition) |publisher=[[Radio Society of Great Britain]] |year=1985|location=Potters bar, UK |isbn=0-900612-69-X | pages=64}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, square "AA" of the QRA locator corresponds to square "JN00" of Maidenhead locator. Maidenhead locator square "IO91", which covers part of Greater London, belongs to QRA locator square "ZL".
* The main squares are subdivided to 80 smaller squares, each one covering 12' by 7'30", and which are numbered from 01 to 80. The small squares are numbered from North to South and West to East. The northwest corner of the main square is indicated with "01" and the southeastern corner with 80.

With this system, a location at 52° 26' 12" N - 0° 13' 6"E would have a QRA locator reference AM52g.

== Disadvantages ==

The QRA locator system has two disadvantages, which led to its replacement by the current Maidenhead system:

* The main disadvantage of the QRA Locator system is that it covers only an area with a Longitude of 52° and a Latitude of 26° so within Europe this does not present a problem, but the coverage cannot not be extended to cover other regions without location ambiguity. 
* Conversion from longitude and latitude to locator reference and vice versa is somewhat complicated.

'''Survey of [[Pakistan]]''' is the sole national mapping and land surveying [[government agency]] of [[Pakistan]]. Its head of department is titles as "[[Surveyor General of Pakistan]]".

==About Survey of Pakistan==
Survey of Pakistan, which emerged as successor to pre-partition Royal Survey of [[India]], is a National Surveying and Mapping Organization of the country. It is primarily responsible for all sorts of topographical land surveys of cis-frontier areas of the entire country. The basic products include map sheets on scale 1:50,000 and 1:250,000. The department is actively participating in the national development projects and thus fulfilling the ever growing surveying and mapping demands of various government / semi-government and autonomous bodies. The geodetic data prepared and maintained by the department is matchless in its accuracy and use. Over the past years, the department has taken a mile stone turn by gradually switching over to surveying and mapping using modern techniques, methods and equipment. This resulted in the outstanding capability of using and manipulating topographical data to develop wide range of applications including [[Geographic Information System]].

===Mission===
To delineate and demarcate International Borders, carry out topographic survey, prepare national geographical data base and publish maps of Pakistan
===Functions===
To survey, print and publish topographical maps of cis-frontier terrain of Pakistan on scale 1:50,000 and derived maps on scales 1:250,000 and 1:1,000,000 for general public use and the defence forces of Pakistan. To establish and maintain geodetic network in the entire country. To delineate and demarcate international borders of Pakistan. To carry out cantonment surveys and others surveys on any desired scale which government / semi government/ autonomous bodies may demand. In addition to above maps preparation of other derived products like Provincial, [[District]], Tehsil maps, Guide maps, Street Maps. A ~ Z Maps and Atlases of desired information for national development projects and general public.

Until September 1999, [[East Timor]] formed part of the [[Indonesia]]n numbering plan, using the [[Country calling code|country code]] '''+62''', followed by area codes for the two largest cities, [[Dili]] (390) and [[Baucau]] (399). Following the [[1999 East Timorese crisis|violence]] in the wake of [[East Timor (province)|Indonesia's departure from the territory]], most of the telecommunications infrastructure was destroyed, and [[Telkom Indonesia]] withdrew its services from East Timor. 

A new country code, '''+670''', was allocated to East Timor, but international access often remains severely limited. A complicating factor is that 670 was previously used by the [[Northern Marianas]], with many carriers not aware that the code is now used by East Timor. (The Northern Marianas, now part of the [[North American Numbering Plan]], use the code 1 and the [[area code 670]].)

East Timor now has a closed numbering plan; all fixed line subscribers' numbers are seven digits, while mobile phone subscribers' numbers are now eight digits, with a '7' being added to the old seven-digit number.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timortelecom.tl/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=176 Timor Telecom]&lt;/ref&gt;

Telephone numbering in East Timor is as follows:

'''Victoria Falls''' ([[Lozi language|Lozi]]: ''Mosi-oa-Tunya'', "The Smoke that Thunders") is a [[waterfall]] in southern [[Africa]] on the [[Zambezi River]] at the border between [[Zambia]] and [[Zimbabwe]].

==Name origins==
[[File:Statue of David Livingstone at Victoria Falls.jpg|thumb|left|upright|L1000609 – Version 2|David Livingstone gazing upon the Falls, in bronze, from the Zambian shore]]
[[David Livingstone]], the Scottish missionary and explorer, is believed to have been the first European to view Victoria Falls on 16 November 1855, from what is now known as Livingstone Island, one of two land masses in the middle of the river, immediately upstream from the falls near the Zambian shore.&lt;ref name="LTA"&gt;{{Cite web | title = Livingstone Tourism Association, Victoria Falls, Zambia |location= Livingstone, Zambia | author =  | work = livingstonetourism.com | date =  | accessdate = 2018-08-07 | url = http://www.livingstonetourism.com/ | language =   | quote =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Livingstone named his discovery in honour of [[Queen Victoria|Queen Victoria of Britain]], but the indigenous [[Lozi language]] name, ''Mosi-oa-Tunya''—"The Smoke That Thunders"—continues in common usage as well.  The [[World Heritage List]] officially recognizes both names.&lt;ref name="WW"/&gt;  Livingstone also cites an older name, ''Seongo'' or ''Chongwe'', which means "The Place of the Rainbow" as a result of the constant spray.&lt;ref name="Wellington1955"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wellington|first=John H. |title=Southern Africa: A Geographical Study|url={{google books|id=mFoBAAAAMAAJ|page=392|keywords=mosi-oa-yunya|plainurl=yes}}|volume=Vol. 1|year=1955|publisher=University Press|location=Cambridge|page=392}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The nearby national park in Zambia is named ''Mosi-oa-Tunya'', whereas the national park and town on  the Zimbabwean shore are both named Victoria Falls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Medium Term Plan (MTP): January 2010 – December 2015|publisher=Government of Zimbabwe|url=http://www.kubatana.net/docs/econ/goz_medium_term_plan_100706.pdf|accessdate=15 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Victoria falls.ogv|title=Victoria Falls Dry Season|thumb|Victoria Falls seen from Zimbabwe in July.]]
While it is neither the highest nor the widest waterfall in the world, Victoria Falls is classified as the largest, based on its combined width of {{convert|1,708|m|ft}}&lt;ref&gt;Southern Africa Places (2009). Victoria Falls. Retrieved on 18 May 2009 from [http://www.places.co.za/html/vicfalls.html Victoria Falls] – South Africa Places&lt;/ref&gt; and height of {{convert|108|m|ft}},&lt;ref name="WDL"&gt;{{cite web |url = {{wdl|550}} |title = Victoria Falls |work = [[World Digital Library]] |date = 1890–1925 |accessdate = 1 June 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in the world's largest sheet of falling water. Victoria Falls is roughly twice the height of North America's [[Niagara Falls]] and well over twice the width of its [[Horseshoe Falls]]. In height and width Victoria Falls is rivalled only by Argentina and Brazil's [[Iguazu Falls]]. See [[#Statistics|table for comparisons]].&lt;ref name="WW"&gt;{{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070714073724/http://www.world-waterfalls.com/index.php|title= World Waterfalls Database}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For a considerable distance upstream from the falls, the Zambezi flows over a level sheet of [[basalt]], in a shallow [[valley]], bounded by low and distant [[sandstone]] hills. The river's course is dotted with numerous tree-covered [[island]]s, which increase in number as the river approaches the falls. There are no mountains, [[escarpments]], or deep valleys; only a flat [[plateau]] extending hundreds of kilometres in all directions.

The falls are formed as the full width of the river plummets in a single vertical drop into a transverse chasm {{convert|1708|m}} wide, carved by its waters along a fracture zone in the basalt plateau. The depth of the chasm, called the '''First Gorge''', varies from {{convert|80|m|ft}} at its western end to {{convert|108|m|ft}} in the centre. The only outlet to the First Gorge is a {{convert|110|m|ft|adj=on}} wide gap about two-thirds of the way across the width of the falls from the western end. The whole volume of the river pours into the Victoria Falls gorges from this narrow cleft.&lt;ref name="readersnatural"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Natural Wonders of the World|publisher=Reader's Digest Association, Inc|year=1980|isbn=0-89577-087-3|editor-last=Scheffel|editor-first=Richard L.|location=United States of America|pages=402-403|quote=|editor-last2=Wernet|editor-first2=Susan J.|url={{google books|plainurl=yes|id=5gopAQAAMAAJ|page=402|keywords=Victoria Falls}} }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two islands on the crest of the falls that are large enough to divide the curtain of water even at full flood: Boaruka Island (or Cataract Island) near the western bank, and Livingstone Island near the middle—the point from which Livingstone first viewed the falls. At less than full flood, additional islets divide the curtain of water into separate parallel streams. The main streams are named, in order from Zimbabwe (west) to Zambia (east): ''Devil's Cataract''&lt;ref name="readersnatural" /&gt; (called ''Leaping Water'' by some), ''Main Falls'', ''Rainbow Falls'' (the highest) and the ''Eastern Cataract''.

The Zambezi river, upstream from the falls, experiences a [[rainy season]] from late November to early April, and a [[dry season]] the rest of the year. The river's annual [[flood]] season is February to May with a peak in April,&lt;ref name="WCD"&gt;[http://www.dams.org/docs/kbase/studies/cszzanx.pdf World Commission on Dams website:] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070701005448/http://www.dams.org/docs/kbase/studies/cszzanx.pdf |date=1 July 2007 }} "Case Study – Kariba Dam-Zambezi River Basin" Annex 13 &amp; 14 Victoria Falls Mean Monthly Flows. Website accessed 1 March 2007. This website gives mean monthly flow rates in cubic metres per second (i.e., the total volume of water passing in each calendar month divided by the number of seconds in the month), the standard measure used in hydrology to indicate seasonal variation in flow. A figure of around 9,000 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/s (318,000 cu ft) is quoted by many websites for Victoria Falls but this is the mean maximum instantaneous rate, which is only achieved for a few days per year. The figure of 536 million m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/minute (18.9 billion cu ft/min) on some websites (e.g. ZNTB) is an error for 536 million litres/minute (equivalent to 9100 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/s or 142 million U.S. gallons/min). The '10-year maximum' is the mean of the maximum monthly rate returned in a ten-year period.&lt;/ref&gt; The spray from the falls typically rises to a height of over {{convert|400|m}}, and sometimes even twice as high, and is visible from up to {{convert|48|km|mi|abbr=on}} away. At full moon, a "moonbow" can be seen in the spray instead of the usual daylight rainbow. During the flood season, however, it is impossible to see the foot of the falls and most of its face, and the walks along the cliff opposite it are in a constant shower and shrouded in mist. Close to the edge of the cliff, spray shoots upward like inverted rain, especially at Zambia's Knife-Edge Bridge.&lt;ref name="Spectrum1996"&gt;{{cite book|title=Spectrum Guide to Zambia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xlUwAQAAIAAJ|year=1996|publisher=Camerapix Publishers International|location=Nairobi|isbn=978-1-86872-012-5|via=Struik Publishers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the dry season takes effect, the islets on the crest become wider and more numerous, and in September to January up to half of the rocky face of the falls may become dry and the bottom of the First Gorge can be seen along most of its length. At this time it becomes possible (though not necessarily safe) to walk across some stretches of the river at the crest. It is also possible to walk to the bottom of the First Gorge at the Zimbabwean side. The minimum flow, which occurs in November, is around a tenth of the April figure; this variation in flow is greater than that of other major falls, and causes Victoria Falls' annual average flow rate to be lower than might be expected based on the maximum flow.&lt;ref name="Spectrum1996" /&gt;

==Gorges==
[[File:Cataratas Victoria, Zambia-Zimbabue, 2018-07-27, DD 36-43 PAN.jpg|thumb|left|First Gorge, from Zambian side]]
The entire volume of the Zambezi River pours through the First Gorge's {{convert|110|m}} wide exit for a distance of about {{convert|150|m}}, then enters a zigzagging series of gorges designated by the order in which the river reaches them. Water entering the ''Second Gorge'' makes a sharp right turn and has carved out a deep pool there called the ''Boiling Pot''. Reached via a steep footpath from the Zambian side, it is about 150 metres (500&amp;nbsp;ft) across. Its surface is smooth at low water, but at high water is marked by enormous, slow swirls and heavy boiling turbulence.&lt;ref name="Spectrum1996" /&gt; Objects and humans that are swept over the falls, including the occasional hippopotamus or crocodile, are frequently found swirling about here or washed up at the north-east end of the Second Gorge. This is where the bodies of Mrs Moss and Mr Orchard, mutilated by crocodiles, were found in 1910 after two canoes were capsized by a hippo at Long Island above the falls.&lt;ref name="NRJ4"&gt;{{cite journal|first=B.

==Formation==
[[File:Victoria Falls National Park marker.jpg|thumb|left|Victoria Falls National Park marker]]

The Upper Zambezi River originally drained south through present day Botswana to join the Limpopo River.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |authors=Moore, A.E., Cotterill, F. P.

This lake was originally [[Endorheic basin|endorheic]] and had no natural outlet, Under wetter climate conditions about 20,000 years BP, it eventually overflowed and began to drain to the east cutting the Batoka Gorge  through the basalt as it went.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/92394/makgadikgadi-salt-pans|title=Makgadikgadi Salt Pans |date=2018 |website=earthobservatory.nasa.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.botswana-travel-guide.com/bradt_guide.asp?bradt=1171|title=Geological history - Botswana Travel Guide|website=www.botswana-travel-guide.com|access-date=2018-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Moore |first1=Andy |editor1-last=Viljoen |editor1-first=Richard |editor2-last=Anhaeusser |editor2-first=Carl |editor3-last=Viljoen |editor3-first=Morris |title=The Victoria Falls and gorges, in Africa's Top Geological Sites |date=2016 |publisher=Struik Nature |location=Cape Town |isbn=9781775844488 |pages=16-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The recent geological history of Victoria Falls can be seen in the overall form of the Batoka Gorge, with its six individual gorges and eight past positions of the falls. The east-west oriented gorges imply [[structural geology|structural control]] with alignment along [[joint (geology)|joints]] of shatter zones, or [[fault (geology)|faults]] with {{convert|50|m}} of vertical displacement as is the case of the second and fifth gorges.  [[Headward erosion]] along these structural lines of weakness would establish a new fall line and abandonment of the earlier line.  North-south oriented joints control the south flowing sections of the river.  One of these is the "Boiling Pot", which links the First Gorge with the Second Gorge.&lt;ref name="VF" /&gt;{{rp|147,149}}&lt;ref name="Spectrum1996" /&gt;

The falls may have already started cutting back the next major gorge, at the dip in one side of the "Devil's Cataract", between the western river bank and Cataract Island. The lip in the current falls is lowest here and carries the greatest concentration of water at flood stage.&lt;ref name=VF/&gt;{{rp|149}}

[[Image:Satellite view of Victoria Falls.jpg|thumb|Satellite image showing the broad Zambezi falling into the narrow cleft and subsequent series of zigzagging gorges (top of picture is north).]]
The [[stratigraphic column|sedimentary sequence]] overlying the basalt at the Zambezi River margins is called the Victoria Falls [[formation (geology)|Formation]], which consists of [[gravel]], the Pipe [[sandstone]], [[Kalahari Basin|Kalahari]] Sands, and [[aeolian processes|aeolian]] sand and [[alluvium]].  A 15-45 m [[escarpment|scarp]] bounds the river about 5-6 km from the main channel, and a series of [[river terrace]]s are evident between the scarp and the channel.&lt;ref name=VF/&gt;{{rp|144-145}}

==History==

===Pre-colonial history===
Archaeological sites around the falls have yielded [[Early Stone Age]] [[Acheulean]] stone artifacts and [[Oldowan]] tools, plus [[Sangoan]] tools and [[Lupemban]] artifacts of [[Middle Stone Age]].&lt;ref name=VF/&gt;{{rp|146}}&lt;ref name="UNEP"&gt;[https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20080510070551/http://www.unep-wcmc.org/sites/wh/mosi-oa-.html United Nations Environment Programme: Protected Areas and World Heritage World Conservation Monitoring Centre]. Website accessed 1 March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Iron-using [[Khoisan]] [[hunter-gatherer]]s displaced these Stone Age people and in turn were displaced by [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]] tribes such as the southern Tonga people known as the [[Tokaleya|Batoka/Tokalea]], who called the falls ''Shungu na mutitima''. The [[Northern Ndebele people|Matabele]], later arrivals, named them ''aManz' aThunqayo'', and the [[Batswana]] and [[Makololo]] (whose language is used by the [[Lozi people]]) call them ''Mosi-o-Tunya''. All these names mean essentially "the smoke that thunders".&lt;ref name="NRJ"&gt;[http://www.nrzam.org.uk/NRJ/V1N4/V1N4.htm ''The Northern Rhodesia Journal'' online]: "Native Name of Victoria Falls", Vol I No 6 p. 68 (1952). Accessed 28 February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

A map from c. 1750 drawn by [[Jacques Nicolas Bellin]] for Abbé Antoine François Prevost d'Exiles marks the falls as "cataractes" and notes a settlement to the north of the Zambezi as being friendly with the Portuguese at the time.  Earlier still [[Nicolas de Fer]]'s 1715 map of southern Africa has the fall clearly marked in the correct position.  It also has dotted lines denoting trade routes that [[David Livingstone]] followed 140 years later.

The first European to see the falls was [[David Livingstone]] on 17 November 1855, during his 1852–56 journey from the upper Zambezi to the mouth of the river. The falls were well known to local tribes, and [[Voortrekker]] hunters may have known of them, as may the Arabs under a name equivalent to "the end of the world". Europeans were sceptical of their reports, perhaps thinking that the lack of mountains and valleys on the plateau made a large falls unlikely.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrzam.org.uk/NRJ/V1N4/V1N4.htm ''The Northern Rhodesia Journal'' online]: "Native Name of Victoria Falls", Vol I No 4 pp. 80–82 (1951).

Accessed 1 September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Livingstone had been told about the falls before he reached them from upriver and was paddled across to a small island that now bears the name Livingstone Island in Zambia. Livingstone had previously been impressed by the [[Ngonye Falls]] further upstream, but found the new falls much more impressive, and gave them their English name in honour of [[Queen Victoria]]. He wrote of the falls, "No one can imagine the beauty of the view from anything witnessed in England. It had never been seen before by European eyes; but scenes so lovely must have been gazed upon by angels in their flight."&lt;ref name="Spectrum1996" /&gt;

In 1860, Livingstone returned to the area and made a detailed study of the falls with [[John Kirk (explorer)|John Kirk]]. Other early European visitors included [[Portugal|Portuguese]] explorer [[Serpa Pinto]], [[Czech Republic|Czech]] explorer [[Emil Holub]], who made the first detailed plan of the falls and its surroundings in 1875 (published in 1880),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radio.cz/en/article/70921 ''The international service of Czech Radio online:] "Statue of explorer Emil Holub unveiled in Livingstone, Zambia" accessed 28 February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; and British artist [[Thomas Baines]], who executed some of the earliest paintings of the falls. Until the area was opened up by the building of the railway in 1905, though, the falls were seldom visited by other Europeans. Some writers believe that the Portuguese priest [[Gonçalo da Silveira]] was the first European to catch sight of the falls back in the sixteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Anderson Walker.

====Victoria Falls Bridge initiates tourism====

European settlement of the Victoria Falls area started around 1900 in response to the desire of [[Cecil Rhodes]]' [[British South Africa Company]] for [[mineral rights]] and imperial rule north of the Zambezi, and the exploitation of other natural resources such as timber forests north-east of the falls, and ivory and animal skins. Before 1905, the river was crossed above the falls at the [[Old Drift cemetery|Old Drift]], by [[Dugout (boat)|dugout canoe]] or a barge towed across with a steel cable.&lt;ref name="NRJ4"/&gt; Rhodes' vision of a [[Cape-Cairo railway]] drove plans for the first bridge across the Zambezi and he insisted it be built where the spray from the falls would fall on passing trains, so the site at the Second Gorge was chosen. See the main article [[Victoria Falls Bridge]] for details.&lt;ref name="Spectrum1996" /&gt; From 1905 the railway offered accessible travel from as far as the [[Cape Town|Cape]] in the south and from 1909, as far as the [[Belgian Congo]] in the north. In 1904 the [[Victoria Falls Hotel]] was opened to accommodate visitors arriving on the new railway.  The falls became an increasingly popular attraction during [[British Empire|British]] colonial rule of [[Northern Rhodesia]] (Zambia) and [[Southern Rhodesia]] (Zimbabwe), with the town of [[Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe|Victoria Falls]] becoming the main tourist centre.

====Zambia's independence and Rhodesia's UDI====

In 1964, Northern Rhodesia became the independent state of Zambia. The following year, [[Rhodesia]] [[Rhodesia#UDI|unilaterally declared independence]].  This was not recognized by Zambia, the United Kingdom nor the vast majority of states and led to [[United Nations]]-mandated sanctions.  In response to the emerging crisis, in 1966 Zambia restricted or stopped border crossings; it did not re-open the border completely until 1980.  [[Guerilla warfare]] arose on the southern side of the Zambezi from 1972: the [[Rhodesian Bush War]]. Visitor numbers began to drop, particularly on the Rhodesian side. The war affected Zambia through military incursions, causing the latter to impose security measures including the stationing of soldiers to restrict access to the gorges and some parts of the falls.

Zimbabwe's internationally recognised independence in 1980 brought comparative peace, and the 1980s witnessed renewed levels of tourism and the development of the region as a centre for [[Extreme sports|adventure sports]]. Activities that gained popularity in the area include [[whitewater rafting]] in the gorges, [[bungee jumping]] from the bridge, [[game fishing]], [[horse riding]], [[kayaking]], and flights over the falls.&lt;ref name="UNEP"/&gt;

====Tourism in recent years====
[[Image:Tourists swimming at Victoria Falls.jpg|thumb|The naturally formed "Devil's Pool", where some tourists swim despite a risk of plunging over the edge]]
By the end of the 1990s almost 400,000 people were visiting the falls annually, and this was expected to rise to over a million in the next decade. Unlike the game parks, Victoria Falls has more Zimbabwean and Zambian visitors than international tourists; the attraction is accessible by bus and train, and is therefore comparatively inexpensive to reach.

Both countries permit tourists to make day trips across the border to view the falls from both viewpoints.  Visitors with single-entry visas are required to purchase a visa each time they cross the border; visas can be obtained at both border posts. Costs vary from US$50–$80 ({{as of|2017|1||lc=y}}).  Visa regulations change frequently; visitors are advised to check the rules currently in effect in both countries before crossing the border in either direction. Additionally, foreign tourists may purchase a KAZA visa for US$50 that will permit visitors to travel between Zambia and Zimbabwe for up to 30 days as long as they remain within the covered countries.

{{anchor|Devil's Pool}}A famous feature is the naturally formed "Armchair" (now sometimes called "Devil's Pool"), near the edge of the falls on Livingstone Island on the Zambian side. When the river flow is at a certain level, usually between September and December, a rock barrier forms an eddy with minimal current, allowing adventurous swimmers to splash around in relative safety a few feet from the point where the water cascades over the falls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-561261/Is-ultimate-dangerous-infinity-pool-world-The-natural-water-hole-perched-edge-Victoria-Falls.html|publisher=[[The Daily Mail]]|title=Is this the ultimate (and most dangerous) infinity pool in the world?|date=23 April 2008|accessdate=22 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Occasional deaths have been reported when people have slipped over the rock barrier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newzimbabwe.com/news-1052-Tour%20guide%20in%20Vic%20Falls%20plunge/news.aspx|publisher=New Zimbabwe|title=Tour guide in Vic Falls plunge|date=28 September 2009|accessdate=22 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The numbers of visitors to the Zimbabwean side of the falls has historically been much higher than the number visiting the Zambia side, due to the greater development of the visitor facilities there. However, the number of tourists visiting Zimbabwe began to decline in the early 2000s as political tensions between supporters and opponents of president [[Robert Mugabe]] increased. In 2006, hotel occupancy on the Zimbabwean side hovered at around 30%, while the Zambian side was at near-capacity, with rates in top hotels reaching [[United States dollar|US$]]630 per night.&lt;ref name="wsj_20061229"&gt;"[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB116734273561861856 At African Waterfall, Visitors Confront A Tale of Two Cities]."

''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''. 29 December 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9502E0D91239F932A15755C0A9629C8B63 Victoria Falls Journal; The Best of Times, and the Worst, for Two Tourist Towns]&lt;/ref&gt; The rapid development has prompted the [[United Nations]] to consider revoking the Falls' status as a [[World Heritage Site]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/africa/victoria-falls-at-risk-un-warns-431122.html Victoria Falls 'at risk', UN warns ''[[The Independent]],'' 7 January 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, problems of waste disposal and a lack of effective management of the falls' environment are a concern.&lt;ref name="ENS"/&gt;

==Natural environment==
[[Image:White rhino Livingstone.jpg|thumb|right|Two [[white rhino]]s at Mosi-oa-Tunya national park in May 2005. They are not [[endemic (ecology)|indigenous]], but were imported from [[South Africa]].]]

===National parks===
The two national parks at the falls are relatively small&amp;nbsp;– [[Mosi-oa-Tunya National Park]] is {{convert|66|km2|}} and [[Victoria Falls National Park]] is {{convert|23|km2|}}. However, next to the latter on the southern bank is the [[Zambezi National Park]], extending {{convert|40|km|mi}} west along the river.&lt;ref name="Spectrum1996" /&gt; Animals can move between the two Zimbabwean parks and can also reach [[Matetsi Safari Area]], [[Kazuma Pan National Park]] and [[Hwange National Park]] to the south.&lt;ref name="UNEP"/&gt;

On the Zambian side, fences and the outskirts of Livingstone tend to confine most animals to the Mosi-oa-Tunya National Park. In addition fences put up by lodges in response to crime restrict animal movement.&lt;ref name="ENS"&gt;[http://www.ens-newswire.com/ens/mar2002/2002-03-05-01.asp S Hanyona: "Zambia's Ecotourism Venture Clouded by Ecotroubles."] 5 March 2002. ENS website accessed 9 March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004 a separate group of police called the Tourism Police was started. They are commonly seen around the main tourist areas, and can be identified by their uniforms with yellow reflective bibs.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.victoriafalls-guide.net/victoria-falls-tourism-police-december-2011.html.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vegetation===
[[Mopane|Mopane woodland savannah]] predominates in the area, with smaller areas of [[miombo]] and [[Rhodesian teak]] woodland and [[tropical and subtropical grasslands, savannas, and shrublands|scrubland savannah]]. Riverine forest with palm trees lines the banks and islands above the falls. The most notable aspect of the area's vegetation though is the [[rainforest]] nurtured by the spray from the falls, containing plants rare for the area such as [[Afzelia|pod mahogany]], [[ebony]], [[ivory palm]], [[Phoenix reclinata|wild date palm]], [[batoko plum]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Victoria Falls in Zimbabwe, October 2017|url=https://independent-travellers.com/zimbabwe/victoria_falls/|website=Independent Travellers|publisher=independent-travellers.com|accessdate=April 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a number of creepers and lianas.&lt;ref name="UNEP"/&gt; Vegetation has suffered in recent droughts, and so have the animals that depend on it, particularly antelope.

===Wildlife===
The national parks contain abundant wildlife including sizable populations of [[elephant]], [[Cape buffalo]], [[giraffe]], [[Grant's zebra]], and a variety of [[antelope]]. [[Panthera leo melanochaita|lion]]s, [[African leopard]]s and [[South African cheetah]]s are only occasionally seen. [[Vervet monkey]]s and [[baboons]] are common. The river above the falls contains large populations of [[hippopotamus]] and [[crocodile]]. [[African bush elephant]]s cross the river in the dry season at particular crossing points.&lt;ref name="UNEP"/&gt;

[[Klipspringer]]s, [[honey badger]]s, [[lizard]]s and [[African clawless otter|clawless otters]] can be glimpsed in the gorges, but they are mainly known for 35 species of [[Bird of prey|raptor]]s. The [[Taita falcon]], [[black eagle]], [[peregrine falcon]] and [[augur buzzard]] breed there. Above the falls, [[heron]]s, [[African fish eagle|fish eagle]]s and numerous kinds of [[waterfowl]] are common.&lt;ref name="UNEP"/&gt;

===Fish===
The river is home to 39 species of [[fish]] below the falls and 84 species above it. This illustrates the effectiveness of the falls as a dividing barrier between the upper and lower Zambezi.&lt;ref name="UNEP"/&gt;
