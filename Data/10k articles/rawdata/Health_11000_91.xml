'''5-Oxo-eicosatetraenoic acid''' (i.e. 5-oxo-6''E'',8''Z'',11''Z'',14''Z''-eicosatetraenoic acid; also termed '''5-oxo-ETE''' and '''5-oxoETE''') is a [[Nonclassic eicosanoid]] metabolite of [[arachidonic acid]] and the most potent naturally occurring member of the [[5-HETE]] family of [[cell signaling]] agents.  Like other cell signaling agents, 5-oxo-ETE is made by a cell and then feeds back to stimulate its parent cell (see [[Autocrine signaling]]) and/or exits this cell to stimulate nearby cells (see [[paracrine signaling]]). 5-Oxo-ETE can stimulate various cell types particularly human [[leukocytes]] but possesses its highest potency and power in stimulating the human [[eosinophil]] type of leukocyte. It is therefore suggested to be formed during and to be an important contributor to the formation and progression of eosinophil-based allergic reactions;&lt;ref name="Biochim Biophys Acta 2014"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Powell WS, Rokach J | title = Biosynthesis, biological effects, and receptors of hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (HETEs) and oxoeicosatetraenoic acids (oxo-ETEs) derived from arachidonic acid | journal = Biochimica et Biophysica Acta | volume = 1851 | issue = 4 | pages = 340–55 | date = April 2015 | pmid = 25449650 | doi = 10.1016/j.bbalip.2014.10.008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cossette C, Gravel S, Reddy CN, Gore V, Chourey S, Ye Q, Snyder NW, Mesaros CA, Blair IA, Lavoie JP, Reinero CR, Rokach J, Powell WS | title = Biosynthesis and actions of 5-oxoeicosatetraenoic acid (5-oxo-ETE) on feline granulocytes | journal = Biochemical Pharmacology | volume = 96 | issue = 3 | pages = 247–55 | date = August 2015 | pmid = 26032638 | doi = 10.1016/j.bcp.2015.05.009 | pmc=4830392}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is also suggested that 5-oxo-ETE may also contribute [[inflammation]], cancer cell growth, and other pathophysiological responses.&lt;ref name="Biochim Biophys Acta 2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Prog Lipid Res 2013. p 19"/&gt;

== Biochemistry and production ==
In the most common means for its production, cells make 5-oxo-ETE in a four step pathway that involves their stimulus-induced activation of the following pathway: '''a)''' the release of arachidonic acid (i.e. 5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z-eicosatetraenoic acid) from its storage sites in membrane [[phospholipids]] due to the activation of [[phospholipase A2]] enzymes; '''b)''' oxygenation of this arachidonic acid with by activated [[arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase]] (ALOX5) to form 5(''S'')-hydroperoxy-6''E'',8''Z'',11''Z'',14''Z''-eicosatetraenoic acid (5(''S'')-HpETE); '''c)''' reduction of this 5(''S'')-HpETE by ubiquitous cellular peroxidases to form 5(''S'')-hydroxy-6''E'',8''Z'',11''Z'',14''Z''-eicosatetraenoic acid (5(''S'')-HETE); and ('''d''') the oxidation of 5(''S'')-HETE by a [[microsome]]-bound [[nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate]] (NADP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;)-dependent dehydrogenase enzyme viz., ([[5-Hydroxyeicosanoid dehydrogenase]] or 5-HEDH) to form 5-oxo-ETE:&lt;ref name="Biochim Biophys Acta 2014"/&gt;  
&lt;center&gt;
'''a)''' Phospholipid-bound arachidonic acid  → free arachidonic acid&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
'''b)''' Free arachidonic acid + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 5''(S'')-HpETE&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
'''c)''' 5''(S)''-HpETE → 5(''S'')-HETE&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
'''d)''' 5''(S)''-HETE + NADP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;  &lt;math&gt;\rightleftharpoons&lt;/math&gt; 5-oxo-ETE + NADPH&lt;/center&gt;

5-HEDH has little or no ability to metabolize the ''R'' [[stereoisomer]] of 5(''S'')-HETE viz., 5(''R'')-HETE, to 5-oxo-ETE.  Furthermore, it acts in a fully reversible manner, readily converting 5-oxo-ETE back to 5(''S'')-HETE. Since cells typically maintain very high levels of NADPH compared to their NADP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; levels, they generally have little or no ability to convert 5(''S'')-HEE to 5-oxo-ETE, and when confronted with 5-oxo-ETE rapidly metabolize it to 5(''S'')-HETE.&lt;ref name="Biochim Biophys Acta 2014"/&gt;  However, cells undergoing aging, senescence, [[apoptosis]], [[oxidative stress]], or other conditions that raise their levels of [[reactive oxygen species]] (e.g. [[superoxide]] anion, [[oxygen radicals]], and [[peroxides]]) either physiologically (e.g. human [[phagocytes]] engulfing bacteria) or pathologically (e.g. oxidatively challenged [[B-lymphocytes]]) use up NADP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, have low NADPH/NADP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ratios, and therefore readily convert 5(''S'')-HETE to 5-oxo-ETE.&lt;ref name="Biochim Biophys Acta 2014"/&gt; Thus, many pathological conditions oxidative stress such as occurs in rapidly growing cancers may be important promoters of 5-oxo-ETE accumulation in vivo.

5-Oxo-ETE can also be made form either 5(''S'')-HpETE (and possibly 5(''R'')-HpEPE) by the action of [[cytochrome P450]] (CYP) enzymes such as [[CYP1A1]], [[CYP1A2]], [[CYP1B1]], and [[CYP2S1]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bui P, Imaizumi S, Beedanagari SR, Reddy ST, Hankinson O | title = Human CYP2S1 metabolizes cyclooxygenase- and lipoxygenase-derived eicosanoids | journal = Drug Metabolism and Disposition | volume = 39 | issue = 2 | pages = 180–90 | date = February 2011 | pmid = 21068195 | pmc = 3033693 | doi = 10.1124/dmd.110.035121 }}&lt;/ref&gt; from 5(''S'')-HETE (and probably 5(''R'')-HETE) by the non-enzymatic attack with [[heme]] or various other dehydrating agents;&lt;ref name="Biochim Biophys Acta 2014"/&gt; It may also form by the conversion of 5-(''S'')-HpETE or 5(''R'')-HpETE to 5-oxo-ETE due to the action of a mouse [[macrophage]] 50-60 [[kilodalton]] cytosolic protein.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zarini S, Murphy RC | title = Biosynthesis of 5-oxo-6,8,11,14-eicosatetraenoic acid from 5-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid in the murine macrophage | journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 278 | issue = 13 | pages = 11190–6 | date = March 2003 | pmid = 12547823 | doi = 10.1074/jbc.M208496200 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The contribution of the latter three pathways to the physiological production of 5-oxo-ETE has not been fully evaluated.

An isomer of 5-oxo-ETE, 5-oxo-(7''E'',9''E'',11''Z'',14''Z'')-eicosatetraenoic acid, forms non-enzymatically as a byproduct of hydrolyses of the 5-lipooxgenase metabolite, [[Leukotriene A4]].  This byproduct differs from 5-oxo-ETE not only in the position and geometry of its double bounds but also in its activity: it stimulates human neutrophils apparently by acting on one or more LTB4 receptors rather than OXER1.&lt;ref name="Biochim Biophys Acta 2014"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Falgueyret J, Riendeau D | title = LTA(4)-derived 5-oxo-eicosatetraenoic acid: pH-dependent formation and interaction with the LTB(4) receptor of human polymorphonuclear leukocytes | journal = Biochimica et Biophysica Acta | volume = 1484 | issue = 1 | pages = 51–8 | date = February 2000 | pmid = 10685030 | doi = 10.1016/s1388-1981(99)00198-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tissue sources ==

=== Cellular production ===
Human [[neutrophil]]s, [[monocyte]]s, [[eosinophil]]s, [[B-lymphocyte]]s, [[dendritic cell]], [[platelets]], airway [[epithelial cell]]s and [[smooth muscle cell]]s, vascular [[endothelial cell]]s, and skin [[keratinocytes]] have been found and/or suggested to make 5-oxo-ETE from endogenous or exogenous 5-HETE, particularly under conditions of oxidative stress; cell lines derived from human cancers such as those from breast, prostate, lung, colon, and various types of leukemia have likewise been shown to be producers of 5-oxo-ETE.&lt;ref name="Prog Lipid Res 2013. p 19"/&gt;

=== Transcellular production ===
Cells of one type may release the 5(''S'')-HETE that they make to nearby cells of a second type which then oxidize the 5(''S'')-HETE to 5-oxo-ETE.  This '''transcellular production''' typically involves the limited variety of cell types that express active 5-lipoxygenase, lack HEDH activity because of their high levels of NADPH compared to NADP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; levels, and therefore accumulate 5(''S'')-HETE, not 5-oxo-ETE, upon stimulation; this 5(''S'')-ETE can leaves these cells, enter various cell types that possess 5-HEDH activity along with lower NADPH to NADP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; levels, and thereby is converted to 5-oxo-ETE.  This transcellular production of 5-oxo-eicosatetraenoates has been demonstrated '''in vitro''' with human neutrophils as the 5(''S'')-HETE producing cells and human [[PC-3]] prostate cancer cells, [[platelets]], and [[monocyte]]-derived [[dendritic cell]]s as the oxidizing cells.&lt;ref name="Prog Lipid Res 2013. p 19"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Powell WS, Rokach J | title = The eosinophil chemoattractant 5-oxo-ETE and the OXE receptor | journal = Progress in Lipid Research | volume = 52 | issue = 4 | pages = 651–65 | date = October 2013 | pmid = 24056189 | doi = 10.1016/j.plipres.2013.09.001 | pmc=5710732}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zimpfer U, Dichmann S, Termeer CC, Simon JC, Schröder JM, Norgauer J | title = Human dendritic cells are a physiological source of the chemotactic arachidonic acid metabolite 5-oxo-eicosatetraenoic acid | journal = Inflammation Research | volume = 49 | issue = 11 | pages = 633–8 | date = November 2000 | pmid = 11131304 | doi = 10.1007/s000110050641 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is theorized that this transcellular metabolism occurs in vivo and provides a mechanism for controlling 5-oxo-ETE production by allowing it to occur or be augmented at sites were 5-lipoxygenase-containg cells congregate with cell types possessing 5-HEDH and favorable NADPH/NADP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ratios; such sites, it is theorized, might include those involving allergy, inflammation, oxidative stress, and rapidly growing cancers.&lt;ref name="Biochim Biophys Acta 2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Prog Lipid Res 2013. p 19"/&gt;

== Metabolism ==

As indicated in the previous section, 5-oxo-ETE is readily converted to 5(''S'')-HETE by 5-HEDH in cells containing very low NADPH/NADP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ratios. Human [[neutrophils]], an important model cell for investigating 5-oxo-ETE production, take up 5-oxo-ETE and reduce it to 5(''S'')-HETE; they also form appreciable amounts of 5(''S''),20-dihydroxy-ETE and small amounts of 5-oxo,20-hydroxy-ETE probably by the action of the ω-hydroxylase [[cytochrome P450]] enzyme, CYP453A on 5(''S'')-HETE and 5-oxo-ETE, respectively.&lt;ref name="Prog Lipid Res 2013. p 19"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = O'Flaherty JT, Taylor JS, Thomas MJ | title = Receptors for the 5-oxo class of eicosanoids in neutrophils | journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 273 | issue = 49 | pages = 32535–41 | date = December 1998 | pmid = 9829988 | doi = 10.1074/jbc.273.49.32535 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The cells also incorporate the 5(''S'')-HETE product of 5-oxo-ETE but little or no 5-oxo-ETE itself as an [[ester]] into their various [[phospholipid]] and [[glycerolipid]] pools; however, isolated neutrophil [[plasma membrane]]s, which lack appreciable 5-HEDH activity, do esterify 5-oxo-ETE into these lipid pools.&lt;ref name="Biochim Biophys Acta 2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

Several other pathways can metabolize 5-oxo-ETE.  First, human [[eosinophils]] use [[Arachidonate 15-lipoxygenase]]-1 (or possibly [[Arachidonate 15-lipoxygenase-2]] to metabolize 5-oxo-ETE to 5-oxo-15-(''S'')-hydroperoxy-ETE which is rapidly reduced to 5-oxo-15(''S'')-hydroxy-ETE; 5-oxo-15(''S'')-hydroxyl-ETE is about one-third as potent as 5-oxo-ETE in stimulating cells.&lt;ref name="Biochim Biophys Acta 2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Prog Lipid Res 2013. p 19"/&gt; Second, human platelets use [[12-lipoxygenase]] to metabolize 5-oxo-ETE to 5-oxo-12(''S'')-hydroperxy-eicosatetraenoat which is rapidly converted to 5-oxo-12(''S'')-hydroxy-eicosatetraenoate (5-oxo-12)''S'')-hydroxy-ETE); 5-oxo-12(''S'')-hydroxyl-ETE is a weak antagonist of 5-oxo-ETE.&lt;ref name="Prog Lipid Res 2013. p 19"/&gt; Third, mouse [[macrophages]] use '''a)''' a [[cytochrome P450]] enzyme to metabolize 5-oxo-ETE to 5-oxo-18-hydroxy-ETE (5-oxo-18-HETE) which is either attacked by a 5-keto-reductase (possibly 5-HEDH) to form 5,18-dihydroxy-eicosatetraenoic acid (5,18-diHETE) or by a Δ6-reductase to form 5-oxo-18-hydroxy-eicosatrienoic acid (5-oxo-18-HETrE) which is then reduced by a 5-keto-reductase (possibly 5-HEDH) to 5,18-dihydroxy-eicosatetrienoic acid (5,18-diHETrE); '''b)''' a cytochrome P450 enzyme converts 5-oxo-ETE to 5-oxo-19-hydroxy-eicosatetraenoic acid (5-oxo-19-HETE) which is then either reduced by a keto reductase (possibly 5-HEDH) to 5,19-dihydroxy-eicosatetraenoic acid (5,19-diHETE) or by a Δ6 reductase to 5-oxo-19-hydroxy-eicosatrienoic acid (5-oxo-19-HETrE);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hevko JM, Bowers RC, Murphy RC | title = Synthesis of 5-oxo-6,8,11,14-eicosatetraenoic acid and identification of novel omega-oxidized metabolites in the mouse macrophage | journal = The Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics | volume = 296 | issue = 2 | pages = 293–305 | date = February 2001 | pmid = 11160610 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or '''c)''' leukotriene C4 synthase to metabolize 5-oxo-ETE to 5-oxo-7-glutathionyl-8,11,14-eicosatrienoic acid (FOG7).

== Mechanism of action ==

=== The OXER1 receptor ===
Studies in human neutrophils first detected a [[plasma membrane]]-localized site which reversibly bound 5-oxo-ETE and had the attributes of a [[Gi alpha subunit]]-linked [[G protein-coupled receptor]] based on the ability of 5-oxo-ETE to activate this class of membrane G proteins by a [[pertussis toxin]]-sensitive mechanism.&lt;ref name="Prog Lipid Res 2013. p 19"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;  Subsequently, this receptor was cloned by several groups who termed it the [[oxoeicosanoid receptor 1]] (OXER1), OXE, OXE-R, hGPCR48, HGPCR48, or R527 (its gene is termed ''OXE1'' or ''OXER1''), and found it coupled with and activated the [[G protein]] complex composed of the [[Gi alpha subunit]] (Gαi) and [[G beta-gamma complex]] (Gβγ).&lt;ref name="Biochim Biophys Acta 2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Prog Lipid Res 2013. p 19"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brink C, Dahlén SE, Drazen J, Evans JF, Hay DW, Rovati GE, Serhan CN, Shimizu T, Yokomizo T | title = International Union of Pharmacology XLIV.

=== Other GPCR receptors ===
Mouse MA-10 cells respond to 5-oxo-ETE but lack OXER1.  It has been suggested that these cells' responses to 5-oxo-ETE are mediated by an ortholog to OXER1, mouse [[niacin receptor 1]], Niacr1, which is a G protein-coupled receptor for [[niacin]], or, alternatively, by one or more of the mouse hydroxycarboxylic acid (HCA) family of the G protein-coupled receptors, HCA1 ([[GPR81]]), HCA2 ([[GPR109A]]), and HCA3 ([[GPR109B]]), which are G protein-coupled receptors for fatty acids.&lt;ref name="Prog Lipid Res 2013. p 19"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid23159987"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cooke M, Di Cónsoli H, Maloberti P, Cornejo Maciel F | title = Expression and function of OXE receptor, an eicosanoid receptor, in steroidogenic cells | journal = Molecular and Cellular Endocrinology | volume = 371 | issue = 1–2 | pages = 71–8 | date = May 2013 | pmid = 23159987 | doi = 10.1016/j.mce.2012.11.003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== PPARγ ===
5-Oxo-ETE and 5-oxo-15(''S'')-hydroxy-ETE but not 5-hydroxy members of the 5-HETE family such as 5-(''S'')-HETE activate [[peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma]] (PPARγ).  This activation does not proceed through OXER1; rather, it involves the direct binding of the oxo analog to PPARγ with 5-oxo-15-(''S'')-hydroxy-ETE being more potent than 5-oxo-ETE in binding and activating PPARγ.&lt;ref name="Biochim. Biophys 2005"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = O'Flaherty JT, Rogers LC, Paumi CM, Hantgan RR, Thomas LR, Clay CE, High K, Chen YQ, Willingham MC, Smitherman PK, Kute TE, Rao A, Cramer SD, Morrow CS | title = 5-Oxo-ETE analogs and the proliferation of cancer cells | journal = Biochimica et Biophysica Acta | volume = 1736 | issue = 3 | pages = 228–36 | date = October 2005 | pmid = 16154383 | doi = 10.1016/j.bbalip.2005.08.009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Activation of OXER1 receptor and PPARγ by the oxo analogs can have opposing effects on cell function.  For example, 5-oxo-ETE-bound OXER1 stimulates whereas 5-oxo-ETE-bound PPARγ inhibits the proliferation of various types of human cancer cell lines; this results in 5-oxo-ETE and 5-oxo-15-(''S'')-HETE having considerably less potency than anticipated in stimulating these cancer cells to proliferate relative to the potency of 5-(''S'')-HETE, a relationship not closely following the potencies of these three compounds in activating OXER1.&lt;ref name="Prog Lipid Res 2013. p 19"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Biochim. Biophys 2005"/&gt;

=== Other mechanisms ===
5-Oxo-ETE relaxes pre-contracted human bronchi by a mechanism that does not appear to involve OXER1 but is otherwise undefined.&lt;ref name="Prog Lipid Res 2013. p 19"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid17499751"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Morin C, Sirois M, Echave V, Gomes MM, Rousseau E | title = Relaxing effects of 5-oxo-ETE on human bronchi involve BK Ca channel activation | journal = Prostaglandins &amp; Other Lipid Mediators | volume = 83 | issue = 4 | pages = 311–9 | date = June 2007 | pmid = 17499751 | doi = 10.1016/j.prostaglandins.2007.03.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Target cells ==

=== Inflammatory cells ===
5-Oxo-ETE is a potent in vitro stimulator and/or enhancer of [[chemotaxis]] (i.e. directional migration) and, depending on the cell type, various other responses such as [[degranulation]] (i.e. release of granule-bound enzymes), oxidative metabolism (i.e. generation of [[reactive oxygen species]]), and production of mediators such as various arachidonic acid metabolites and [[platelet-activating factor]] in human eosinophils, [[basophil]]s, neutrophils, and [[monocyte]]s.&lt;ref name="Prog Lipid Res 2013. p 19"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid8906847"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sozzani S, Zhou D, Locati M, Bernasconi S, Luini W, Mantovani A, O'Flaherty JT | title = Stimulating properties of 5-oxo-eicosanoids for human monocytes: synergism with monocyte chemotactic protein-1 and -3 | journal = Journal of Immunology | volume = 157 | issue = 10 | pages = 4664–71 | date = November 1996 | pmid = 8906847 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the injection of 5-oxo-ETE into the skin of humans causes the local accumulation of circulating blood cells, particularly  eosinophils but also to lesser extents neutrophils and [[monocyte]]-derived [[macrophages]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Muro S, Hamid Q, Olivenstein R, Taha R, Rokach J, Powell WS | title = 5-oxo-6,8,11,14-eicosatetraenoic acid induces the infiltration of granulocytes into human skin | journal = The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology | volume = 112 | issue = 4 | pages = 768–74 | date = October 2003 | pmid = 14564360 | doi = 10.1016/S0091-6749(03)01888-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The activity of 5-oxo-ETE on the two cell types known to be involved in allergy-based inflammation, eosinophils and basophils, suggests that it may be involved in promoting allergic reactions possibly by attracting through [[chemotaxis]] these cells to nascent sites of allergy and/or through stimulating these cells to release granule-bound enzymes, reactive oxygen species, or other promoters of allergic reactions.&lt;ref name="Prog Lipid Res 2013. p 19"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;  5-Oxo-ETE's activity on human cells involved in non-allergic inflammatory diseases viz., neutrophils and monocytes, as well as its ability to attack these cell types to the skin of humans suggest that 5-oxo-ETE may also be involved in the broad category of non-allergic inflammatory diseases including those involving host defense against pathogens.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

=== Lung airway smooth muscle cells ===
5-Oxo-ETE contracts smooth muscle and organ-cultured bronchi isolated from guinea pigs but relaxes bronchi isolated from human lung; the relaxation of human bronchi caused by 5-oxo-ETE may not involve its OXER1.&lt;ref name="Prog Lipid Res 2013. p 19"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 17499751 | year = 2007 | author1 = Morin | first1 = C | title = Relaxing effects of 5-oxo-ETE on human bronchi involve BK Ca channel activation | journal = Prostaglandins &amp; Other Lipid Mediators | volume = 83 | issue = 4 | pages = 311–9 | last2 = Sirois | first2 = M | last3 = Echave | first3 = V | last4 = Gomes | first4 = M. M. | last5 = Rousseau | first5 = E | doi = 10.1016/j.prostaglandins.2007.03.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  These results suggest that 5-oxo-ETE is not directly involved in the [[bronchoconstriction]]) that occurs in eosinophil-based allergic [[asthma]] reactions in humans.

=== Cancer cells ===
5-Oxo-ETE (or other 5-HETE family member) stimulates the growth and/or survival of human cell lines derived from cancers of the prostate, breast, lung, ovary, colon and pancreas&lt;ref name="Biochim Biophys Acta 2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Prog Lipid Res 2013. p 19"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Biochim. Biophys 2005"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Grant GE, Rubino S, Gravel S, Wang X, Patel P, Rokach J, Powell WS | title = Enhanced formation of 5-oxo-6,8,11,14-eicosatetraenoic acid by cancer cells in response to oxidative stress, docosahexaenoic acid and neutrophil-derived 5-hydroxy-6,8,11,14-eicosatetraenoic acid | journal = Carcinogenesis | volume = 32 | issue = 6 | pages = 822–8 | date = June 2011 | pmid = 21393477 | pmc = 3146358 | doi = 10.1093/carcin/bgr044 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These preclinical studies suggest that 5-oxo-ETE (or other 5-HETE family member) may contribute to the cited cancers progression in humans.

=== Steroidogenic cells ===
5-oxo-ETE stimulates human [[H295R]] adrenocortical cells to increase transcription of steroidogenic acute regulatory protein messenger RNA and produce [[aldosterone]] and [[progesterone]] by an apparent OXER1-dependent pathway.&lt;ref name="pmid23159987"/&gt;

=== Other cell types ===
5-Oxo-ETE induces an isotonic volume reduction in guinea pig intestinal crypt epithelial cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = MacLeod RJ, Lembessis P, Hamilton JR, Powell WS | title = 5-Oxo-6,8,11,14-eicosatetraenoic acid stimulates isotonic volume reduction of guinea pig jejunal crypt epithelial cells | journal = The Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics | volume = 291 | issue = 2 | pages = 511–6 | date = November 1999 | pmid = 10525065 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Interaction with other stimuli ==
5-Oxo-ETE and another potential mediator of human allergic reactions, [[platelet-activating factor]], act in [[synergy]] in stimulating human eosinophils and neutrophils: the combined agents elicit responses that are greater than the simple sum of their individual actions and do so at relatively low.&lt;ref name="pmid8683135"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = O'Flaherty JT, Kuroki M, Nixon AB, Wijkander J, Yee E, Lee SL, Smitherman PK, Wykle RL, Daniel LW | title = 5-Oxo-eicosatetraenoate is a broadly active, eosinophil-selective stimulus for human granulocytes | journal = Journal of Immunology | volume = 157 | issue = 1 | pages = 336–42 | date = July 1996 | pmid = 8683135 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid7803484"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = O'Flaherty JT, Cordes JF, Lee SL, Samuel M, Thomas MJ | title = Chemical and biological characterization of oxo-eicosatetraenoic acids | journal = Biochimica et Biophysica Acta | volume = 1201 | issue = 3 | pages = 505–15 | date = December 1994 | pmid = 7803484 | doi = 10.1016/0304-4165(94)90083-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 5-Oxo-ETE also greatly increases the potencies of [[complement component 5a]], [[LTB4]], and [[FMLP]] in stimulating human eosinophils to degranulate and its degranulating activity is greatly increase by pretreating human eosinophils with [[granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor]] or human neutrophils with either the latter [[cytokine]] or with [[granulocyte colony-stimulating factor]], [[tumor necrosis factor α]], or various [[nucleotides]] including [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]].&lt;ref name="pmid8683135"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid7803484"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = O'Flaherty JT, Kuroki M, Nixon AB, Wijkander J, Yee E, Lee SL, Smitherman PK, Wykle RL, Daniel LW | title = 5-Oxo-eicosanoids and hematopoietic cytokines cooperate in stimulating neutrophil function and the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway | journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 271 | issue = 30 | pages = 17821–8 | date = July 1996 | pmid = 8663432 | doi = 10.1074/jbc.271.30.17821 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = O'Flaherty JT, Cordes JF | title = Human neutrophil degranulation responses to nucleotides | journal = Laboratory Investigation; A Journal of Technical Methods and Pathology | volume = 70 | issue = 6 | pages = 816–21 | date = June 1994 | pmid = 8015286 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Pretreament of eosinophils with [[interleukin 5]] (a key mediator in eosinophil activation) also increases their in vitro chemotactic response to 5-oxo-ETE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Guilbert M, Ferland C, Bossé M, Flamand N, Lavigne S, Laviolette M | title = 5-Oxo-6,8,11,14-eicosatetraenoic acid induces important eosinophil transmigration through basement membrane components: comparison of normal and asthmatic eosinophils | journal = American Journal of Respiratory Cell and Molecular Biology | volume = 21 | issue = 1 | pages = 97–104 | date = July 1999 | pmid = 10385597 | doi = 10.1165/ajrcmb.21.1.3517 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 5-Oxo-ETE also acts in synergy with two [[chemokines]], [[CCL2]] and [[CCL8]], in stimulating monocyte chemotaxis.&lt;ref name="pmid8906847"/&gt;  The interactions of 5-oxo-ETE with these mediators of allergy (e.g. platelet-activating factor, interleukin 5) in eosinophils further suggests that it plays a role in allergic diseases while its interactions with mediators of inflammatory reactions (e.g. tumor necrosis factor α, the colony stimulating factors, and the two CCL chemokines) in neutrophils and monocytes further suggest that it plays a role in inflammatory responses and host defense mechanisms.

== Clinical significance ==
Essentially all of the studies on 5-oxo-ETE's activities and target cells, similar to those on other members of the 5(''S'')-HETE family of agonists, are best classified as [[pre-clinical development]] studies: they have not yet been determined to be important in human pathophysiology. [[Translation studies]] are needed to learn if the preclinical studies implicating 5-Oxo-ETE and other 5(''S'')-HETE family members in allergic diseases, inflammatory diseases, cancer, steroid production, bone remodeling, parturition, and other pathophysiological events, as outlined here and on the [[5-HETE]] page, are relevant to humans and therefore of clinical significance.

The '''American Medical Student Association''' ('''AMSA'''), founded in 1950 and based in [[Washington, D.C.]], is the oldest and largest independent association of [[physician]]s-in-training in the [[United States]].  AMSA is a student-governed, national organization.  They have a membership of 68,000 [[medical student]]s, premedical students, interns, [[Medical residency|medical residents]] and practicing [[physician]]s from across the country. 

AMSA's action committees and interest groups help expose medical students to information on subjects not generally covered in traditional curricula, and is the only major national medical organization in the US that accepts no sponsorship or funding from any [[pharmaceutical company]].&lt;ref name="pmid16435890"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Moghimi Y |title=The "PharmFree" campaign: educating medical students about industry influence |journal=PLoS Med. |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=e30 |date=January 2006 |pmid=16435890 |pmc=1360625 |doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.0030030 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Strategic priorities==
In November 2007, AMSA leaders decided upon four strategic priorities:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amsa.org/AMSA/Homepage/About/Priorities.aspx|title=Mission &amp; Aspirations - AMSA|publisher=|access-date=2013-07-18|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130407003809/http://www.amsa.org/AMSA/Homepage/About/Priorities.aspx|archive-date=2013-04-07|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[universal health care|Quality, Affordable Health Care for All]]'' through advocacy for [[health care reform]] and a [[single-payer health care|single-payer universal health care system]]
* ''[[global health|Global Health]] Equity'' through education about our responsibility for rational and proportional assistance for all people
* ''Enriching Medicine Through [[Multiculturalism|Diversity]]'' by improving recruitment and retention into medicine of under-reperesented minorities, while increasing the diversity of its own leadership
* ''Professional Integrity, Development and Student Well-Being'' that creates a humane and cooperative learning environment, one that will develop physicians worthy of the public trust, through work hour reform, revitalization of professionalism in the medical field, and through AMSA's [[PharmFree]] campaign

==History==
The American Medical Student Association (AMSA) was founded in 1950, as the Student American Medical Association (SAMA), under the auspices of the [[American Medical Association]] (AMA). The main purpose of the organization was to provide medical students a chance to participate in organized medicine.

The late 1960s saw dramatic changes in the organization's objectives and philosophy.  In 1967, AMSA established its independence from the AMA,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.startribune.com/business/49206527.html?refer=y |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130203012838/http://www.startribune.com/business/49206527.html?refer=y |dead-url=yes |archive-date=February 3, 2013 |title=Doctors deeply divided over national health care reform |work=StarTribune |date=June 27, 2009 |accessdate=November 10, 2012 |author=Yee, Chen May }}&lt;/ref&gt; became student-governed, and began to raise its own voice on a variety of socio-medical issues, including [[civil rights]], [[abortion rights]], [[universal health care]] and [[Vietnam]].&lt;ref name="History"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amsa.org/AMSA/Homepage/About/History.aspx|title=History of AMSA - AMSA|publisher=|access-date=2013-07-18|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130705100307/http://www.amsa.org/AMSA/Homepage/About/History.aspx|archive-date=2013-07-05|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a collaboration with medical educators that began in 1968, AMSA proposed numerous reforms and model curricula, to transform medical education in order to make the profession more responsive to community and societal needs.  AMSA was also instrumental in the introduction of the original [[Family Practice Act of 1970]], and supported legislation establishing the [[National Health Service Corps]].

AMSA has led a campaign to reform [[medical resident work hours]], long a controversial issue in the field.  In 2001 AMSA joined the [[Committee of Interns &amp; Residents]] and [[Public Citizen]] in filing a petition with the [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] asking for federal oversight of resident work hours as a matter of workplace safety. AMSA authored the [[Patient and Physician Safety and Protection Act of 2005]], introduced by Senator [[Jon Corzine]] (S. 1297) and Representative [[John Conyers]] (H.R.1228). AMSA and the [[Committee of Interns &amp; Residents]] also jointly maintain a website advocating for work hours reform called [http://www.hourswatch.org Hours Watch] that presents the latest scientific research on the topic.

In addition to sponsoring events highlighting prospects for universal health care, medical technology and [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]], AMSA also has organized the [[PharmFree|PharmFree Campaign]] to educate and train its members to interact professionally and ethically with the [[pharmaceutical industry]].

In September, 2005, AMSA led the National Conference on the Financing of Undergraduate Medical Education, an event that brought together legislators, medical organizations, medical students and others to address skyrocketing [[medical debt]].

==Annual convention==
[[File:USCapitolDome.jpg|thumb|right]]
Each spring, AMSA's Annual Convention brings together nearly 1,500 physicians-in-training and leaders in medical education and health policy.

The location of the convention alternates from year to year between the DC metro area and other locations. At the Convention, are renowned Keynote Speakers and many healthcare related exhibitors.

Also, at convention the House Of Delegates (HOD) meets.  The HOD is where AMSA's members take ownership of the Association. As AMSA's official policy-making body, the HOD is a delegation of AMSA members from each local medical chapter who meet once a year at the Annual Convention to vote on AMSA's policies and to elect our national officers. The HOD is open to all members of AMSA to speak and vote. The members debate the issues, make the amendments and cast the votes that shape AMSA's policies. Any member of AMSA has the ability to write and submit resolutions to the HOD.

==Action committees==
AMSA has ten Action Committees (AC's).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amsa.org/AMSA/Homepage/About/Committees.aspx|title=AMSA Action Committees - AMSA|publisher=|access-date=2013-07-18|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130621202451/http://www.amsa.org/amsa/homepage/About/Committees.aspx|archive-date=2013-06-21|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the Board of Trustees governs the organization, the Action Committees produce ideas and projects. They promote these areas of interest and associated projects to AMSA members on national, regional and local levels and are integral in helping AMSA maintain its view of medicine.

==IFMSA partnership==

In 2008, IFMSA-USA merged with AMSA.&lt;ref name="History" /&gt; IFMSA-USA used to be the US representative to the [[International Federation of Medical Students' Associations]] (IFMSA).  Since the merger, AMSA now is able to offer international exchanges for research&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amsa.org/ifmsa/research.cfm|title=Page Not Found - (404 Error) - AMSA|publisher=|access-date=2009-05-10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090303064514/http://www.amsa.org/ifmsa/research.cfm|archive-date=2009-03-03|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and clinical&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amsa.org/ifmsa/clinical.cfm|title=Page Not Found - (404 Error) - AMSA|publisher=|access-date=2009-05-10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090411085032/http://www.amsa.org/ifmsa/clinical.cfm|archive-date=2009-04-11|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; electives to nearly 70 countries through SCORE and SCOPE respectively.   The exchanges are available to medical student members.  Research exchanges are also available to select pre-med members.  AMSA also now sends a delegation of students to the semi-annual [[IFMSA]] General Assemblies (GA) of IFMSA.

The PharmFree project, established by the AMSA in 2002, was created from the belief that the medical profession needs more detachment from pharmaceutical firms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2005/1228/p20s01-lire.html |title=Backstory: A pill they won't swallow / The Christian Science Monitor |publisher=CSMonitor.com |date=2005-12-28 |accessdate=2012-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Spending on marketing to physicians, which includes gifts to med students, rose from $12.1 billion in 1999 to $22 billion in 2003.  Based on the premise that taking gifts from [[pharmaceutical companies]] creates a [[conflict of interest]] for doctors, AMSA now urges both students and practising physicians to 'just say no' to all personal gifts from Pharmaceutical companies.

The PharmFree campaign has included a march on Pfizer offices in [[New York City]], where members assembled at the firm's front doors and dumped thousands of pens marked with the company's logo on the doorstep.  Additionally, under the leadership of then-President [[Leana Wen]], AMSA started the Counterdetailing Campaign in 2005 to encourage physicians-in-training to educate practicing physicians about alternative sources of information regarding pharmaceuticals.  As "detailing" is the concept of drug representatives selling biased information to physicians, AMSA came up with the concept of "counterdetailing" as an opposing concept, for students to bring physicians evidence-based sources of information.  In May 2007, AMSA released the  PharmFree Scorecard,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amsascorecard.org/|title=AMSA Scorecard|website=www.amsascorecard.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; the first to evaluate medical schools according to their pharmaceutical interaction policies.  Of all the medical schools in the United States, five received a grade of “A,” which translates into comprehensive school policy that restricts pharmaceutical representatives to both the medical school campus and its academic medical centers.  Forty schools received an “F” for their lack of policies or encouraging physicians-in-training to obtain information from drug representatives.

Allies and supporters of this campaign include [[No Free Lunch (organization)|No Free Lunch]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nofreelunch.org/ |title=No Free Lunch |publisher=No Free Lunch |date= |accessdate=2012-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[AARP]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aarp.org/ |title=Health, Travel Deals, Baby Boomers, Election News, Over 50, Online Games, Retirement Plan |publisher=AARP |date= |accessdate=2012-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Consumers Union]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.consumersunion.org/health/health-prescription.html |title=Consumers Union |publisher=Consumers Union |date= |accessdate=2012-11-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121021081300/http://www.consumersunion.org/health/health-prescription.html |archivedate=2012-10-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Medical Letter]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medicalletter.org/ |title=Prescription drug information and drug facts since 1959 |publisher=The Medical Letter |date= |accessdate=2012-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[National Physicians Alliance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://npalliance.org/ |title=National Physicians Alliance |publisher=Npalliance.org |date= |accessdate=2012-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===AMSA Academy===
[[File:AMSAacademy.jpg|thumb|right]]
AMSA Academy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amsa.org/academy/|title=Career Development - AMSA|publisher=|access-date=2009-04-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090412131227/http://www.amsa.org/academy/|archive-date=2009-04-12|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a training ground for physician leaders, established by and for students. The Academy strives to empower medical students to effect change in medicine. Combining didactic with experiential learning, AMSA Academy courses take medical students through the core competencies of leadership and project implementation, while building on key principles of important topics in medicine.

Each program fosters the value of health care must be patient-centered, effective, efficient, safe, equitable, and timely, as identified by the Institute of Medicine. AMSA identifies their mission as training physician leaders in order to transform the face of medicine.

===AMSA Foundation===
The Foundation was established by AMSA in 1964 as a means to address issues in medical education and to provide low cost small emergency loans to medical students in need. In 1974, the Board of Trustees of the Association and the Board of Directors of the Foundation decided to broaden its role. Since then, the Foundation has functioned as the programming arm of AMSA.

During its history, the AMSA Foundation has developed a national reputation for designing and conducting quality and innovative programming. It has managed over $75,000,000 of grant and contract funds during this period. Much of the organization's early work was performed under contract with the U.S. Public Health Service. From 1971 through 1980, the AMSA Foundation was the primary recruiter of physicians for the [[National Health Service Corps]], [[Bureau of Medical Services]] and the [[Indian Health Service]].

The AMSA Foundation has also worked extensively with private foundations and corporations on programs designed to augment physician development and innovations in medical education. The organization was one of the original innovators of interdisciplinary health team training for medical and health professions students-an initiative that has continued to this day. AMSA has also launched programs in primary care, complementary and alternative medicine, international health, health policy, HIV/AIDS education, substance abuse prevention, breast cancer prevention, health services management and end of life care for medical and other health professions students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amsafoundation.org|title=AMSA Foundation|website=www.amsafoundation.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Leadership==
AMSA was always led by students. The National President is elected by members to serve a one-year term during which he/she is based in AMSA's Reston offices. The President takes a year's leave from medical school in order to serve AMSA and its mission.

AMSA also has staff that work in its Reston offices, including an executive director. In 2006, AMSA's long-time executive director, Paul R. Wright, retired.

Past AMSA presidents have gone on to many leadership positions in the government and in academia.

==Logo==
[[File:AMSA logo.jpg|thumb|right|The 2009 AMSA logo, combining the newer [[shield (heraldry)|shield]] featuring the [[Rod of Asclepius]] and "AMSA" in text reminiscent of the older logo]]

[[File:AMSA OLD LOGO.jpg|thumb|right|The older AMSA logo, no longer used, in effect from 1950-2009]]

To celebrate AMSA's 60th anniversary, a new [[logo]] was designed to commemorate the occasion.  Importantly, the [[Rod of Asclepius]] has been incorporated into a shield, beside which "AMSA" is spelled out (using a custom [[font]] which differs from the original logo).  The letters AMSA rest upon the fully spelled out name of the organization, using the font "Today."

The crest contains four colours; from top right clockwise, they are and represent:
*Blue - (although it is not explicitly explained why the blue is in the shield, the colour blue in general represents AMSA's history and tradition, since its logo has always been blue)
*Purple - Purple illustrates the advocacy efforts on behalf of [[LGBT]] medical students and those discriminated against based on gender and sexuality
*Red - Red was incorporated into the new logo to reflect the organization’s dedication to fighting the global AIDS pandemic
*Green - Green exemplifies AMSA’s commitment to a better environment and environmental health and the organization’s commitment to reducing its carbon footprint&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.amsa.org/AMSA/Homepage/About/AMSA_logo.aspx |title=AMSA Logo |publisher=Amsa.org |date= |accessdate=2012-11-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120712005730/http://www.amsa.org/AMSA/Homepage/About/AMSA_logo.aspx |archive-date=2012-07-12 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also a [[blazon]] as to the usage of the logo, including size, dimensions and colours.  These can be found at AMSA's website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amsa.org/AMSA/Homepage/About/AMSA_logo/AMSALogoGuidelines.aspx|title=Page Not Found - (404 Error) - AMSA|publisher=|access-date=2009-10-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100124065911/http://www.amsa.org/AMSA/Homepage/About/AMSA_logo/AMSALogoGuidelines.aspx|archive-date=2010-01-24|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2197">'''Aortocaval compression syndrome''' is compression of the [[abdominal aorta]] and [[inferior vena cava]] by the [[pregnant|gravid]] [[uterus]] when a pregnant woman lies on her back, i.e. in the [[supine position]]. It is a frequent cause of low maternal [[blood pressure]] ([[hypotension]]), which can be result in loss of [[consciousness]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kiefer R, Ploppa A, Dieterich H | title = [Aortocaval compression syndrome] | journal = Anaesthesist | volume = 52 | issue = 11 | pages = 1073–83; quiz 1084 | year = 2003 | pmid = 14992095 | doi=10.1007/s00101-003-0596-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in extreme circumstances [[fetus|fetal]] demise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Banaś T, Godula Z, Herman R | title = [Aortocaval compression syndrome as an explanation of sudden intrauterine death of mature twins at term. Case report] | journal = Ginekol Pol | volume = 75 | issue = 8 | pages = 633–7 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15517787}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aortocaval compression is thought to be the cause of '''supine hypotensive syndrome'''. Supine hypotensive syndrome  is characterized by [[pallor]], [[tachycardia]], [[sweating]], [[nausea]], [[hypotension]] and [[dizziness]] and occurs when a pregnant woman lies on her back and resolves when she is turned on her side.&lt;ref&gt;Sharma S. Shock and Pregnancy. eMedicine.com. URL: [http://www.emedicine.com/med/topic3285.htm http://www.emedicine.com/med/topic3285.htm]. Accessed on: March 11, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The aorta and inferior vena cava are central vessels, the largest artery and vein. They supply blood to the heart, and the rest of the body. Thus, when there is compression due to the weight of the fetus, signs of [[Shock (circulatory)|shock]] (sweating, pallor, fast and weak pulse) may be experienced. Patients should be placed in a [[Left lateral decubitus position|left lateral recumbent position]] and emergency help summoned immediately.

'''Aparicio Méndez Manfredini''' (August 24, 1904 – June 27, 1988) was a Uruguayan political figure. He was a [[De facto government doctrine|de facto]] [[President of Uruguay|President]]  of [[Uruguay]] from 1976–1981 as a non-democratically elected authority of the [[civic-military dictatorship of Uruguay (1973-1985)|Civic-military dictatorship (1973–1985)]].

==Background==
Born in the northern city of [[Rivera]], Méndez was a member of the [[National Party (Uruguay)|National Party]], traditionally strong in the interior of the country from whence he originated. He built up a reputation as an expert in administrative law.

Méndez served as Health Minister from 1961–1964.

In addition to his political life, Méndez was a close personal friend of the Spanish classical guitarist [[Andrés Segovia]].  Segovia lived in [[Montevideo]] during the 1940s, and came into contact with Méndez during this time.  Segovia composed two original pieces for Méndez, the Anecdote #4 (published in ''Guitar Review Magazine'' in 1947), and the Preludio #8 (subtitled "on a theme by Aparicio Méndez") which was published by Edizioni Musicali Bèrben in 1998.

==President of Uruguay==
Méndez was one of various civilian political figures who participated in the civilian-military administration which took office following President [[Juan Maria Bordaberry]]'s [[coup]] in 1973 at a time of great social tension. It was as one who had built a reputation for reliability with its military participants that he subsequently served as President for five years.

===Free constitutional referendum===
In 1980, Méndez's government held a constitutional referendum, the free nature of which was underlined by the fact that the electorate rejected the government's proposals.

==Death and legacy==
Méndez died in [[Montevideo]] in 1988. Some would argue that, in agreeing to serve as President with military support, Aparicio Méndez was effectively repudiating the principles of the National Party with which he had been associated. Others would point out that Méndez was far from alone among the various civilian party political figures who participated in the [[Civic-military dictatorship of Uruguay (1973-1985)|Civic-military dictatorship (1973–1985)]], and that he presided over a free referendum.

'''Capital punishment in South Africa''' was abolished on 6 June 1995 by the ruling of the [[Constitutional Court of South Africa|Constitutional Court]] in the case of ''[[S v Makwanyane]]'', following a five-year and four-month moratorium since February 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=South Africa's Supreme Court Abolishes Death Penalty |first=Howard W. |last=French |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/06/07/world/south-africa-s-supreme-court-abolishes-death-penalty.html |newspaper=New York Times |date=6 June 1995 |accessdate=18 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The standard method for carrying out executions was [[hanging]], sometimes of several convicts at the same time. Mandatory death penalty for murder was abolished in 1935. At the same time, criminal justice saw an increased racialisation in disfavour of the non-white majority, who represented the vast majority of accused and convicted in capital cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chs.revues.org/index312.html |title=Robert Turrell, White Mercy. A Study of the Death Penalty in South Africa |website=Chs.revues.org |date= |accessdate=2016-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hanging was maintained following the [[South African republic referendum, 1960|instatement of a republic in 1961]]. At approximately the same time South Africa saw mounting international criticism against purposely political executions of anti-apartheid activists convicted of violent crimes, mainly of blacks, but in some cases of whites, such as [[John Frederick Harris]] in 1965.

The 1980s saw a rapid increase in the number of executions; 164 in 1987 alone (an official tally higher than that of any other country, including the [[People's Republic of China]] and [[Iran]]). Since 1959, the South African government officially performed 2,949 hangings (14 of women), including 1,123 in the 1980s.&lt;ref name="capitalpunishmentuk.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.capitalpunishmentuk.org/sandra.html |title=Sandra Smith – the last woman to be hanged in South Africa |website=Capitalpunishmentuk.org |date=1989-11-14 |accessdate=2016-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Out of more than one hundred South Africans executed in 1988, only three were white.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/12/01/world/hangings-now-the-routine-at-pretoria-prison.html | work=The New York Times | first=John D. | last=Battersby | title=Hangings Now the Routine at Pretoria Prison | date=1 December 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the grim statistics, not all capital cases ended with execution; of 83 black South Africans convicted of killing whites between June 1982 and June 1983 some 38 were hanged, as well as one white convicted of killing a white (out of 52). Executions were carried out in [[Pretoria Central Prison]]; condemned prisoners were held in a section of the prison called "The Pot".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=igpeefRMWKsC&amp;pg=PA178 |page=178 |title=The Abuses of Punishment|author=Robert Adams|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |year=1998 |isbn=0-312-17617-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The last execution carried out by the South African government was the hanging of [[Solomon Ngobeni]] in November 1989. The last woman executed was Sandra Smith on 2 June the same year along with her boyfriend Yassiem Harris, in all cases following a murder conviction.&lt;ref name="capitalpunishmentuk.org"/&gt; In February 1990, a moratorium was declared by President [[FW de Klerk|De Klerk]]. Two further executions were, however, carried out in the nominally independent "[[bantustan|homelands]]" of [[Boputhatswana]] and [[Venda]] in 1990 and 1991 respectively.&lt;ref name="cpuk"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.capitalpunishmentuk.org/common.html |first=Richard |last=Clark |title=Capital punishment in the Commonwealth |work=Capital Punishment UK |accessdate=18 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the death penalty was abolished in 1995, opinion polls suggest significant public support for its reinstatement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.angusreidglobal.com/polls/10342/south_africans_support_death_penalty/ |archive-url= https://archive.is/20140422162953/http://www.angusreidglobal.com/polls/10342/south_africans_support_death_penalty/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=22 April 2014 |title=South Africans Support Death Penalty |publisher= Angus Reid Global |date=14 May 2006 |accessdate=22 April 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/Youth-want-death-penalty-reinstated-20130222 |title=Youth 'want death penalty reinstated' |date=22 February 2013 |agency=SAPA |accessdate=22 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2014 poll in South Africa found that 76 percent of [[Millennials|millennium generation]] South Africans support re-introduction of the death penalty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Location Settings |url= http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/Youth-want-death-penalty-reinstated-20130222 |title=Youth 'want death penalty reinstated' |publisher=News24 |date=2013-02-22 |accessdate=2014-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current situation==

There are a number of parties in South Africa that currently support the return of the death penalty. They are the [[National Party South Africa]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.nationalparty.co.za/death%20penalty.htm |title=National Party South Africa (NP) |website= Nationalparty.co.za |date= |accessdate=2016-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[African Christian Democratic Party]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acdp.org.za/policies/justice/ |title=Justice |publisher=ACDP |date= |accessdate=2016-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Economic Freedom Fighters]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://news.iafrica.com/sa/883240.html |title=iafrica.com Juju wants death penalty |website=News.iafrica.com |date= |accessdate=2016-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url = http://www.economicfreedomfighters.org/malema-wants-death-penalty-efflaunch/ |title=Malema wants death penalty #EFFlaunch &amp;#124; Economic Freedom Fighters - EFF |publisher=Economic Freedom Fighters |date=2013-10-13 |accessdate=2016-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[National Conservative Party of South Africa]].

2018 saw growing calls for the return of the death penalty. On 20 July the [[Inkatha Freedom Party]] (IFP) stated that the time had come to discuss the possibility of reinstating the [[death penalty]] in South Africa,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.thesouthafrican.com/should-sa-bring-back-the-death-penalty-ifp-believes-it-may-be-time/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://citizen.co.za/news/south-africa/1984017/lets-talk-about-bringing-back-the-death-penalty-says-ifp//&lt;/ref&gt; and on the 8th of August the [[National Freedom Party]] called for the restoration of the death penalty in South Africa after the death of Khensani Maseko, in a call similar to that of the IFP weeks before.&lt;ref&gt;https://citizen.co.za/news/south-africa/1992519/nfp-echoes-ifp-calls-for-death-penalty-after-rape-victims-suicide/&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Chilean Pharmaceutical Policy''' was an attempt in the 1960s and 1970s to introduce a rational [[national pharmaceuticals policy]]. [[Chile]] was perhaps the first country in the world to introduce the concept of a limited number of [[essential drugs]]. 

In 1965 the government of President [[Eduardo Frei Montalva|Eduardo Frei]] took measures to rationalise drug supply and use and in 1967, a [[national formulary]] with a limited list of drugs came into being. In 1970, [[Salvador Allende]] was elected to power and rationalisation of the pharmaceutical supply system continued. 

The next step was to organise centralised bulk procurement. The first international [[Call for bids|tender]] for raw materials was called in 1971. However, the [[pharmaceutical industry]] struck back: in the three months following the call for tender, widely used drugs, including [[analgesics]] and [[antibiotics]], disappeared from the market. The manufacturers had cut their production. They agreed to replenish the market within one week only if the international tenders were called off. 

In 1972, the government was forced to succumb and called off the tenders. In 1973, the government of Allende [[1973 Chilean coup d'état|was toppled]] and the first essential drug programme hitherto known was dead.{{reflist}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8156">The '''Chukwu octuplets''' were the first set of [[multiple birth|octuplets]] live-born in the [[United States]] in [[recorded history]]. The birth happened in 1998.

==Family history==
The six girls and two boys were born in December 1998 at [[St. Luke's Episcopal Hospital]] in [[Houston, Texas]].  Their parents — mother, Nkem Chukwu (then 27) and father, Iyke Louis Udobi (then 41) — are both [[Nigeria]]n-born American citizens.&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D06E5D6133FF932A05751C1A96E958260&amp;pagewanted=print "Mother of the Octuplets Goes Home to Recover"], by Rick Lyman, ''[[The New York Times]],'' December 31, 1998; retrieved January 10, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

All weighed under two pounds at the time of birth.&lt;ref name="HChron"/&gt; The first born, Ebuka, was delivered on December 8, 15 weeks [[Preterm birth|premature]]. The remaining 7 octuplets were born by [[Caesarean section]] on December 20, 13 weeks premature. The smallest of the octuplets, Odera, died on December 27, a week after birth (she was the lightest of the 8 babies, weighing just over 300 grams (10&amp;nbsp;oz).  The obstetrician was Brian Kirshon, a well-known physician practicing in Houston.

The seven remaining octuplets celebrated their 10th birthday in Houston on December 20, 2008, in the company of volunteers who helped in their early years. The five girls and two boys are reported to be "normal, active and bright fourth-graders."&lt;ref name="HChron"&gt;[http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/headline/metro/6175553.html "Houston octuplets celebrate 10th birthday"], by Jennifer Leahy, from the [[Houston Chronicle]] website, December 20, 2008, retrieved February 2, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media appearances==
Early January 2009, Nkem Chukwu and her husband, Iyke Louis Udobi, appeared January 27, 2009, for the first time in 10 years on national TV on ABC's ''[[Good Morning America]]'' in a prerecorded segment where they commented on the birth of the new [[Suleman octuplets]]. The next day, January 28, 2009, the whole family along with grandmother Janet Chukwu appeared on NBC's ''[[Today (NBC program)|The Today Show]]'',&lt;ref name="The Today Show"&gt;[http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/28891400/ "Houston octuplets visit The Today Show"], by Michael Inbar, from [[Today (NBC program)|The Today Show]] website, January 28, 2009, retrieved February 7, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; which was the first time the octuplets appeared on national television since their first birthdays. Later that day, they were whisked to the [[Associated Press]] (AP) World Headquarters for a TV interview for the world newswires. On Monday February 2, they also appeared on the ''[[Larry King Live]]'' show in a segment titled "Octuplet Outrage" focusing on the worldwide coverage generated by Nadya Suleman's 14 children and the ethical and medical controversy.&lt;ref name="Larry King Live"&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcTGQFHnUXY "Chukwu Octuplets visit Larry King Live"]&lt;/ref&gt; On February 9, 2009, Nkem and Iyke Chukwu appeared on Radio One's talk show ''The [[Mo'Nique]] show''.&lt;ref name="Mo'Nique Show"&gt;[http://www.firstoctuplets.com/2009/02/our-interview-with-comedienne-and-radio.html "Chukwu Octuplets parents on the Mo'Nique radio show"] February 9, 2009, retrieved February 10, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; They also appeared Sunday February 15, 2009, on a local TV segment on KHOU-TV, Houston, Texas, on a family update.&lt;ref name="KHOU-TV"&gt;[http://www.khou.com/topstories/stories/khou090216_tnt_houston-octuplets.1f895e89.html "Houston Octuplets weigh in on California multiples"] {{webarchive |url=https://archive.is/20090219165728/http://www.khou.com/topstories/stories/khou090216_tnt_houston-octuplets.1f895e89.html |date=February 19, 2009 }}, by KHOU-TV, Houston from the KHOU-TV website, February 16, 2009, retrieved February 18, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; They also appeared on CNN's AC360 on February 18, 2009. The family Publicist, Kemi Omololu-Olunloyo, told media that Nkem Chukwu only wanted to address the health and well-being of the Suleman octuplets rather than the controversy about the number of children Suleman had. Nkem Chukwu later addressed the Nadya Suleman octuplet row with Randi Kaye of CNN's ''Anderson Cooper 360'' show on February 18, 2009.&lt;ref name="AC360"&gt;[http://ac360.blogs.cnn.com/2009/02/18/growing-up-in-a-family-of-octuplets/ "Growing up as Octuplets"], by CNN-TV's Anderson Cooper 360, from the AC360 blog, February 18, 2009, retrieved February 18, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 2, 2009, Nkem Chukwu released the statement:
: In light of the Bellflower mom, Nadya Suleman's story, I spoke on ''The Today Show''.&lt;ref name="The Today Show" /&gt; When asked, Iyke Louis Udobi stated in their recent AP interview that 'if you can take care of one, you can take care of eight'.&lt;ref name="AP Interview"&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-alvC4AW3I&amp;feature=channel_page "Houston Octuplet dad tells AP parents who can take care of one baby can do the same with 8!"], by Bonny Goach, from [[Associated Press]] TV website, January 28, 2009, retrieved February 7, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chukwu octuplets embarked on a world tour themed "Promoting Healthy Families". The tour, which began in mid-2009 and included the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, England ,and the parents' native Nigeria, included visits to TV talk shows, health clinics, summer camps, and supermarket seminars on large families for the children and speaking engagements at prenatal and postnatal clinics for Nkem.&lt;ref name="The Today Show"/&gt; In a March 18, 2009, interview in ''[[The Daily Sentinel (Texas)|The Daily Sentinel]]'', Iyke Louis and Nkem stated said that they did not intend to have so many children but accepted the children as a gift from God. Several projects are in the works for the Chukwus, including a book, magazine deals, and even a possible documentary.{{dead link|date=November 2012}}&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, Trent (March 18, 2008).

He had a degree from the [[University of Nottingham]] and pursued climbing as a hobby.&lt;ref name="usatoday30.usatoday.com"/&gt; He had worked for an engineering firm and took time off to go on adventures and climbing expeditions,&lt;ref name=indp/&gt; but had been planning to start work as a school teacher in the autumn of 2006.&lt;ref name="usatoday30.usatoday.com"/&gt;

==Overview==
David Sharp was born in [[Harpenden]], near London, and later attended [[Prior Pursglove College]] and the [[University of Nottingham]].&lt;ref name="peterleni.com"&gt;http://www.peterleni.com/David%20Sharp%20Sunday%20Times%20Magazine.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated with a [[Mechanical Engineering]] degree in 1993.&lt;ref name="peterleni.com"/&gt; He worked for the Global security company [[Qinetiq|QinetiQ]].&lt;ref name="indp"/&gt; In 2005 he quit this job and took a teacher training course, and was planning to start work as a teacher in the autumn of 2006.&lt;ref name="peterleni.com"/&gt; David Sharp was also an experienced and accomplished mountaineer, and had climbed some of the world's tallest mountains including Cho Oyu in the Himalayas. Sharp was more of a purist related to mountaineering, and did not believe in using a guide for mountains he was familiar with, local climbing assistance or artificial enhancements, such as high altitude drugs or supplementary oxygen, to reach the top of a mountain.&lt;ref name="Dying for Everest"/&gt;

==Expeditions and summits==
===Mountaineering summary===
While growing up in England, Sharp climbed [[Roseberry Topping]].&lt;ref name="usatoday2" /&gt; At university, he was a member of the Mountaineering Club.&lt;ref name= usatoday2&gt;{{cite news|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/tech/science/2006-07-16-everest-david-sharp_x.htm|title=Everest remains deadly draw for climbers – USA TODAY|accessdate=1 October 2016|date=July 16, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sharp also took a six-month sabbatical from his job to go on a [[Backpacking (wilderness)|backpacking]] trip through [[South America]] and Asia.&lt;ref name="indp"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/2006/07/23/a-climbers-highest-ambition-span-classbankheadtwice-briton-david-sharp-attempted-to-conquer-the-worlds-tallest-mountain-then-he-made-his-third-tryspan/45b59a4e-5158-44a1-bedf-cacbc831f367/|title=A Climber's Highest Ambition |first=Allen G.

===2001 Gasherbrum II expedition===
In 2001, Sharp went on an expedition to Gasherbrum II, an {{convert|8035|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} mountain located in the [[Karakoram]], on the border between [[Gilgit-Baltistan|Gilgit–Baltistan province]], [[Pakistan]], and [[Xinjiang]], China.&lt;ref name=times/&gt; The expedition, led by Henry Todd, did not summit due to bad weather.&lt;ref name=times/&gt;

===2002 Cho Oyu expedition===
In 2002, Sharp went on an expedition to Cho Oyu, an {{convert|8201|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} peak in the Himalayas, with a group led by Richard Dougan and Jamie McGuinness of the Himalayan Project.&lt;ref name=times/&gt; They did make it to the summit, but one member died from falling into a crevasse; this opened up a slot on the group's trip to Everest the next year.&lt;ref name=times/&gt; Dougan regarded Sharp as a strong climber, but noted that he was tall and skinny, possessing a light frame with little [[body fat]]; in cold-weather mountaineering, body fat can be critical to survival.&lt;ref name="times" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mensfitness.com/life/outdoor/what-its-actually-climb-everest-no-oxygen-and-document-whole-thing-snapchat|title=What it's Actually Like to Climb Everest With No Oxygen—and Document the Whole Thing on Snapchat|last=Carlson|first=Caitlin|work=mensfitness.com|accessdate=1 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2003 Mount Everest expedition===
Sharp's first Mount Everest expedition was in 2003 with a group led by British climber Richard Dougan.&lt;ref name="everest1953.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.everest1953.co.uk/2000-to-2009|title=Mount Everest Expeditions 2000 to 2009|work=everest1953.co.uk|accessdate=1 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The party also included Terence Bannon, Martin Duggan, Stephen Synnott, and Jamie McGuinness. Only Bannon and McGuinness reached the summit, but the group incurred no fatalities.&lt;ref name="everest1953.co.uk"/&gt; Dougan noted that Sharp had acclimatized well and was their strongest team member.&lt;ref name="usatoday30.usatoday.com"/&gt; In addition, Sharp was noted for being a pleasant person at camp and had a talent for rock climbing.&lt;ref name="usatoday30.usatoday.com"/&gt; However, when Sharp started to get frostbite on the group's ascent, most of the group agreed to turn back with him from the summit.&lt;ref name="usatoday30.usatoday.com"/&gt;

Dougan and Sharp helped a struggling Spanish climber who was heading up at that time, and gave him some extra oxygen.&lt;ref name="usatoday30.usatoday.com"/&gt; Sharp lost some of his toes to frostbite on this climb (including the [[big toe]] on his left foot), which led him to buy top-of-the line Millet boots for the 2004 season.&lt;ref name="usatoday30.usatoday.com"/&gt;

===2004 Mount Everest expedition===
In 2004, Sharp joined a Franco-Austrian expedition to the north side of Mount Everest,&lt;ref name=times&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peterleni.com/David%20Sharp%20Sunday%20Times%20Magazine.pdf|title=The Sunday Times – Left to die at the top of the world |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; climbed to {{convert|8500|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, but did not reach the summit.&lt;ref name="everest1953.co.uk"/&gt; Sharp could not keep up with the others and stopped before the [[Three Steps|First Step]].&lt;ref name=times/&gt; The expedition's leader was Hugues d’Aubarede, a French climber who was later killed in the [[2008 K2 disaster]] (his third attempt to climb that mountain),&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2010/nov/13/k2-accident-himalayas-climbers-families|title=K2 tragedy: 'We had no body, no funeral, no farewell ...'|first=Graham|last=Bowley|date=12 November 2010|publisher=|accessdate=1 October 2016|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; but who became, on this 2004 expedition, the 56th French person to summit Everest.&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"/&gt; D'Aubarede's group reached the summit on the morning of 17 May&lt;ref name="himalayandatabase.com1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.himalayandatabase.com/2004%20Season%20Lists/2004%20Spring%20A3.html|title=Himalayan Database Expedition Archives of Elizabeth Hawley|work=himalayandatabase.com|accessdate=1 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and included Austrians Marcus Noichl, Paul Koller, and Fredrichs "Fritz" Klausner as well as Nepalis [[Chhang Dawa Sherpa]], Lhakpa Gyalzen Sherpa, and Zimba Zangbu Sherpa (also known as Ang Babu).&lt;ref name="himalayandatabase.com1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.everestnews2004.com/everestnews4/summitsbyteamnortheverest2004.htm|title=158 Summit Everest from Nepal in 2004: South Side Summits|work=everestnews2004.com|accessdate=1 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Sharp died in 2006, d'Aubarede was on an expedition to K2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.explorersweb.com/everest_k2/news.php?id=10138|title=Everest K2 News ExplorersWeb – ExplorersWeb Week in Review|work=explorersweb.com|accessdate=1 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

D'Aubarede said Sharp disagreed with him that it was wrong to climb alone and to attempt summiting without using supplementary oxygen.&lt;ref name="peterleni.com1"&gt;http://www.peterleni.com/David%20Sharp%20Sunday%20Times%20Magazine.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; This is confirmed by Sharp's emails to other climbers in which he stated he did not believe in using extra oxygen.&lt;ref name="peterleni.com1" /&gt; He joined four climbers on this expedition, so Sharp relented on that point of disagreement, but only for a time, as he would return in 2006 for his solo attempt.&lt;ref name="peterleni.com1" /&gt; As a result of his 2004 attempt, Sharp incurred frostbite on his fingers during the expedition.

===2006 Mount Everest expedition===
Two years later during the 2006 climbing season, Sharp returned to Everest a third time in an attempt to reach the summit on a solo climb arranged through [[Asian Trekking]]. However, the attempt ultimately cost him his life on 15 May 2006.&lt;ref name="everest1953.co.uk"/&gt;  Sharp was climbing alone, and had intended to attempt reaching the summit without using supplementary oxygen, which is considered to be extremely risky even for very strong acclimatized mountain climbers or Sherpas.&lt;ref name="Dying for Everest"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Master&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZzKGCgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=master+of+this+air&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiy-q3c3LjQAhUi7oMKHe03DMgQ6AEIKzAB#v=onepage&amp;q=master%20of%20this%20air&amp;f=false|title=Master of Thin Air: Life and Death on the World's Highest Peaks|work=by Andrew Lock and Peter Hillary, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Sharp apparently did not consider it a challenge to climb Everest with supplementary oxygen.&lt;ref name=times/&gt;
Sharp was climbing with a bare-bones "basic services" package from [[Asian Trekking]] that cost Sharp only about US$7,000 which does not offer support after a certain altitude is reached on the mountain or a Sherpa to climb with as a partner, although this option was available to Sharp for an additional fee.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; He was grouped with 13 other independent climbers – including [[Vitor Negrete]], Thomas Weber, and Igor Plyushkin who also [[List of people who died climbing Mount Everest|died attempting to summit]] that year – on the ''International Everest Expedition''.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; This package only provided a permit, a trip into Tibet, oxygen equipment and then transportation, food, and tents up to the Mount Everest "Advance Base Camp" (ABC) at an elevation of about {{convert|6340|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The group Sharp was with was not really an "expedition" and had no leader, although it is considered good climbing ethics that members of the group make some effort to keep track of each other.&lt;ref name="explorersweb.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.explorersweb.com/everest_k2/news.php?id=10049|title=Everest K2 News ExplorersWeb – Turkish climbers about David Sharp: "He was not part of a team"|work=explorersweb.com|accessdate=1 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before Sharp booked his trip with Asian Trekking, his friend Jamie McGuinness, an experienced climber and guide, had invited him to join his organized expedition for only US$1,000 more than Sharp was paying Asian Trekking. Normally, McGuinness's expedition fee ranged from US$20,000 to $30,000, and Sharp would have realized a discount of more than US$10,000. Sharp acknowledged this as a good deal, but he would be tied into working with a group and would not be able to do things independently and climb at his own pace, so he declined the offer.&lt;ref name="times" /&gt;  Critically, Sharp opted to climb alone without a climbing Sherpa, without sufficient supplementary oxygen (reportedly only two bottles, which is only enough for about 8 to 10 hours of climbing at high altitude) and without even a radio to call for help if he did encounter problems.&lt;ref name="Dying for Everest"/&gt;&lt;ref name=times/&gt;&lt;ref name="washingtonpost 2006-07-30" /&gt;&lt;ref name="washingtontimes.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2006/may/22/20060522-110420-9433r/|title=Everest climber left to die alone|work=The Washingtion Times|accessdate=20 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=top&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.outsideonline.com/1909966/over-top|title=Over the Top|work=Outside Online|accessdate=20 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sharp was transported by vehicle to the Base Camp and then his equipment was transported by yak train to the Advance Base Camp, as part of the Asian Trekking "basic services" package, where he remained for five days to acclimatize to the altitude.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; He then began making several trips up and down the mountain to set up and stock his upper camps and further acclimatize himself. Sharp likely set out from a camp high on the mountain below the northeast ridge to make a summit attempt during the late evening of 13 May 2006, and reportedly only had a very limited supply of supplementary oxygen he intended to use only in an emergency.  Sharp either reached the summit or turned back near the summit to descend very late in the day on 14 May 2006, and was forced to camp out exposed, or "bivouac", during his descent in the dark at about {{convert|8500|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} under a rock overhang known as [[Green Boots|Green Boots' Cave]].  There he was overcome by the elements without any remaining supplementary oxygen, possibly combined with equipment problems, on one of the coldest nights of the season.

Sharp's predicament was not immediately known for several reasons: he was not climbing with an expedition that would monitor climbers' locations; he had not told anyone beforehand of his summit attempt (although other climbers spotted him on his ascent); he did not have a radio or satellite phone with him to let anyone know where he was or that he was in trouble; and two other more inexperienced climbers from his group went missing at around the same time.&lt;ref name="usatoday30.usatoday.com"/&gt; One of the two missing climbers was Malaysian Ravi Chandran, who was eventually found but required medical attention after getting frostbite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.everestnews.com/everest2006/brazilnortheverest05222006.htm|title=Everest 2006: Eight dead on Everest|work=everestnews.com|accessdate=1 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some members of the group of climbers Sharp was with, including [[George Dijmarescu]], figured out that Sharp was missing when he did not return later in the evening on 15 May 2006 and there were no reports of anyone seeing him.  However it was not known where he could be. Sharp was a more experienced climber who had previously turned around attempting to summit when he started experiencing problems, and it was surmised that Sharp likely crawled into an unoccupied tent at one of the higher camps or decided to bivouac somewhere higher up on Everest, so his failure to return to camp did not initially cause serious concern.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=20060717&amp;slug=webeverest17|title=Nation &amp; World – Near the summit, David Sharp waved off fellow climbers: "I just want to sleep" – Seattle Times Newspaper|work=nwsource.com|accessdate=1 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; High-altitude bivouacs are known to be very risky, but are sometimes recommended in certain extreme situations;&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZzKGCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT135&amp;lpg=PT135&amp;dq=reinburger%20high-altitude%20bivouac&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=5xc_p3Jhm_&amp;sig=QlqpxJbLJfX1av-zDAP80elpZbg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwir74WqiLfNAhXGPiYKHWjCB_AQ6AEINzAD#v=onepage&amp;q=reinburger%20high-altitude%20bivouac&amp;f=false|title=Master of Thin Air: Life and Death on the World's Highest Peaks|first=Andrew|last=Lock|date=1 September 2015|publisher=Skyhorse Publishing, Inc.|accessdate=1 October 2016|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mike Rheinberger and Mark Whetu had summited and successfully camped at high altitude just below the summit in 1994, as documented in the 1995 film "Mount Everest – The Summit of Dreams".  However, Rheinberger became overcome by altitude sickness and died during the descent on the following day, and Whetu barely made it down, suffering from severe frostbite.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt;

Sharp may have decided to bivouac or just rest at Green Boots' Cave due to the extreme cold and exhaustion, combined with problems with his equipment and no supplementary oxygen. He was likely also suffering some degree of altitude sickness due to a lack of supplementary oxygen. He was never able to get up and continue his descent, even with the help of other climbers and supplementary oxygen later in the morning on 15 May 2006, and he subsequently died in Green Boots' Cave.

==Details of Sharp's 2006 Everest incident==
===Problems at high altitudes===
[[File:Everest Oxygen Graph.jpg|thumb|Available oxygen at Everest]]
The top of Everest is nearly 9000 m above sea level. The peak was officially recognized in 2010 to be at an elevation of {{convert|8848|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} with the usual presence of snow and ice.&lt;ref&gt;
{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/8608913.stm|title=Official height for Everest set|date=2010-04-08|newspaper=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Above about {{convert|8000|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, which is approaching the cruising altitude of pressurized commercial jetliners, the air pressure is so low that the amount of available oxygen to breathe is less than one-third than at sea level, and there are significantly lower ambient air temperatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adlers.com.au/oxygen.php|title=Oxygen at Altitude|work=www.adlers.com.au}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lack of oxygen, in addition to the extreme cold, leaves climbers bewildered and very weak, makes them very susceptible to [[hypothermia]] or getting [[frostbite]], and can cause them to succumb to altitude sickness (or [[Altitude sickness|Acute Mountain Sickness]] leading to [[High-altitude pulmonary edema|HAPE]] or [[High-altitude cerebral edema|HACE]]) and pass out.

Even using supplementary oxygen (with a mask connected to a tank of oxygen) only partially compensates for the thin air, and the only way that climbers experiencing the effects of altitude sickness can recover is to descend much lower as quickly as possible with supplementary oxygen. Above about {{convert|6000|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} is considered to be uninhabitable for any period of time as, physiologically, the human body is unable to survive such hypoxic conditions, much less adapt to them.&lt;ref name=Master/&gt; Many climbers lose their lives due to the debilitating effects of very limited oxygen at high altitudes, and since the rescue of someone who is not mobile at high altitudes is extremely difficult, it is potentially fatal for the rescuer and the climber. Even for someone in trouble who is able to walk at high altitudes, rescue can be a monumental undertaking given that simple tasks, such as picking up a wrapper, can be a significant effort.&lt;ref name=Cost&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2016/05/27/the-extraordinary-cost-of-retrieving-dead-bodies-from-mount-everest|title=The extraordinary cost of retrieving dead bodies from Mount Everest|work=Washington Post, 27 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the rescue of a stricken climber at high altitudes is sometimes possible, as the cases of [[Lincoln Hall (climber)|Lincoln Hall]] and Usha Bista illustrate.

In late May 2006 Lincoln Hall (another Asian Trekking client) was [[Lincoln Hall (climber)#Rescue on Everest|rescued]] from a height of about {{convert|8700|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} on the northeast ridge, after being left by the four climbing Sherpas who were trying to rescue him. The Sherpas were running out of oxygen and could not get him down before nightfall, as at that time Hall was not mobile. After surviving the night (which was about 25 degrees Celsius warmer than the night of Sharp's bivouac), and regaining consciousness, Hall was rescued on the following day – involving over a dozen rested climbing Sherpas, about 40–50 bottles of oxygen for Hall, and taking over 20 hours.&lt;ref name="Dying for Everest"/&gt; Hall descended in reasonably good health although suffering from frostbite and the lingering effects of altitude sickness. Hall ultimately lost the tips of his fingers and a toe to frostbite, but otherwise eventually fully recovered. However, similar to other successful high altitude rescues, Hall was able to walk even though he was suffering from exposure and altitude sickness.

Also, on 21 May 2007 Canadian climber Meagan McGrath initiated the successful high-altitude rescue of Nepali Usha Bista who was suffering the effects of altitude sickness on the south side of Everest at a height of about {{convert|8300|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, just above the high camps at the South Col around {{convert|8000|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} high. McGrath realized Bista was in trouble and flagged down two other climbers to start assisting Bista, and called down to the high camps for additional climbers to assist.  However, it was daytime and Bista was initially mobile. In addition, unlike where Sharp and Hall became incapacitated (around the First Step and above the Exit Cracks on the north side of Everest), Bista was discovered in trouble at a [[Everest#Southeast ridge|location where there were not very technical sections]] below to reach a higher camp where additional help was available.  The rescue climbers were eventually able to help Bista descend down and then put her in a sleeping bag to drag her down to a location where further help was available.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/canadian-honoured-for-heroic-mount-everest-rescue-1.686547|title=Canadian honoured for heroic Mount Everest rescue|work=CBC News, Posted May 28, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

However, other rescue attempts of stricken climbers high on Everest who were not mobile have resulted in not only the death of the stricken climber, but also resulted in the death of those attempting to rescue them.  For example, in 1996 climber [[1996 Mount Everest disaster|Doug Hansen]] became incapacitated during a descent at a high elevation on the south side of Everest. [[Rob Hall]], an experienced Everest climber and expedition guide with Hansen, was able to assist Hansen down to a point below the base of the [[Hillary Step]] on the south side around the [[South Summit (Mount Everest)|South Summit]], but could not continue due to Hansen being immobile and a severe storm, combined with Hall being exhausted and likely suffering from exposure from helping Hansen down, even though they had supplementary oxygen. Hall refused to leave Hansen, and instead requested that additional supplementary oxygen be brought up to them.  Fellow expedition guide Andrew Harris, who was lower on the mountain, turned around in an attempt to reach Hansen and Hall with additional supplementary oxygen.  However, the rescue attempt was not successful and resulted in death of Hansen, Hall and Harris.&lt;ref&gt;
{{citation |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/everest/exposure/epilogue.html|title=High Exposure|work= David Breashears}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For stricken climbers above {{convert|8000|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} some experienced climbers have said that if you cannot walk at such a high altitude, you might as well be on the moon in terms of a possible successful rescue.  That is why the area above {{convert|8000|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} is referred to as the [[Mount Everest#Death zone|"death zone"]]. Even attempting to move a dead climber's body takes significant effort, and the recovery of a dead climber's body at high altitude is a monumental effort at a very slow pace.  The recovery sometimes must be abandoned, and risks the lives of those attempting the recovery since these attempts have resulted in additional deaths while just attempting to move a dead climber's body.&lt;ref name=Cost/&gt; That is why bodies of dead climbers high on Everest are left where they died or just moved off the main climbing routes.&lt;ref name=Graveyard&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/28139/mount-everest-graveyard|title=The Mount Everest Graveyard|work=MentalFloss Article by Stacy Conradt}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalpost.com/news/canada/canadian-womans-body-recovered-on-mount-everest-by-sherpas|title=Canadian woman's body recovered on Mount Everest by Sherpas|work=National Post, 28 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/reclaiming-the-dead-on-mt-everest-1.1206082|title=Reclaiming the dead on Mt.

Also, the human body's response to increasingly high altitudes is difficult to predict, regardless of prior instances of functioning at lower altitudes or previous experience at high altitudes.&lt;ref name="independent.co.uk" /&gt; For example, Igor Plyushkin, a [[Snow Leopard award]]-winning climber (having summited all five {{convert|7000|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} mountains in the former Soviet Union), died on 22 May 2006 while attempting to summit Everest, despite being with a group who gave him extra oxygen and medicine at just {{convert|7800|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="independent.co.uk"&gt;

Negrete was aware that Sharp had died as he set out on his own fatal summit climb.&lt;ref name="explorersweb.com"/&gt; Just days after Sharp's demise, and after several unfortunate occurrences,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; he reached the summit alone — without oxygen, a sherpa, radio, or a satellite phone&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;

The fate of climbers like Negrete illustrates why climbers are advised to bring a radio, use bottled oxygen at higher altitudes and have at least one climbing partner: altitude sickness can occur suddenly and without warning, leaving a climber disoriented and "nutty".&lt;ref name="online.liebertpub.com"&gt;

The high altitudes of Everest can have a dramatic effect on the human body. One climber who summited Everest in 2016 described his coming back down this way:&lt;ref name="netnebraska.org"&gt;

There are significant risks associated with climbing into the "death zone" of Everest, which has claimed many lives, as well as many limbs. One survivor of the [[1996 Mount Everest disaster]], Beck Weathers, was left on the mountain exposed at a high altitude on the south side of Everest because he was overcome by the elements and initially could not walk any further or be rescued after descending to about {{convert|7900|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} during a storm following an unsuccessful summit attempt.  He miraculously woke up later and was able to stumble into a nearby camp.  Although it was a monumental effort to bring him further down the mountain and airlift him off the mountain by helicopter where that was possible at a lower altitude, he would ultimately lose his nose, parts of both feet and his hands due to frostbite, but he did survive. Afterwards, Weathers said that his view on climbing Everest had changed "fairly dramatically. If you don’t have anyone who cares about you or is dependent on you, if you have no friends or colleagues, and if you’re willing to put a single round in the chamber of a revolver and put it in your mouth and pull the trigger, then yeah, it’s a pretty good idea to climb Everest.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20151008-the-graveyard-in-the-clouds-everests-200-dead-bodies|title=Death in the clouds: The problem with Everest’s 200+ bodies|first=Rachel|last=Nuwer|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Accounts of Sharp's fatal climb===
It is believed that Sharp set out to make a summit attempt during the evening of 13 May 2006.&lt;ref name="times" /&gt; His high camp was just below the Northeast Ridge, and he needed to first climb what is referred to as the "Exit Cracks", and then traverse the Northeast Ridge including the [[Three Steps]] before being able to reach the summit, and then climb down to return to his high camp.&lt;ref name=times/&gt;

American climber and Himex guide Bill Crouse and his group encountered someone, later believed to be Sharp, at the base of the Third Step in the afternoon on 14 May 2006 as they descended from the summit, and then later during their descent saw him higher on the mountain.&lt;ref name="usatoday30.usatoday.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Himex1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cartoonhd.watch/watch/everest-beyond-the-limit/season/1/episode/3|title=Watch Movies Online Free – Watch TV Shows|website=cartoonhd.watch}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other climbers had also observed a lone climber, later believed to be Sharp, beginning his ascent along the northeast ridge on the way up to the summit late in the day on 14 May 2006. Back at base camp, other climbers who knew Sharp felt he was experienced enough to turn back if he became fatigued or had a problem, as he had done in previous expeditions.&lt;ref name="usatoday30.usatoday.com"/&gt;

Sharp likely either reached the summit very late in the day on 14 May 2006 and then began to descend, or he turned back near the summit to descend very late in the day on 14 May 2006.  Due to how late in the day Sharp was descending along with other potential problems, such as issues with his equipment (problems with his head lamp descending in the dark as well as frozen oxygen supply equipment reported by others later), along with potential exhaustion and running out of oxygen,&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Sharp apparently had to seek shelter on his way back down.  The extreme cold that day, fatigue, lack of oxygen and darkness likely made a descent to the high camp very dangerous or just not possible for Sharp due to the circumstances.

Sharp ultimately died under a rock overhang below the summit along the Northeast Ridge known by climbers as "[[Green Boots]]' Cave" near the First Step at {{convert|8500|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} along the northeast ridge approach to the summit, sitting with arms clasped around his legs, next to and to the right of a [[Green Boots|green-booted body]], who is commonly believed to be Indian climber [[Tsewang Paljor]] who died 10 years earlier in the same place in 1996, under somewhat similar circumstances related to seeking shelter in the harsh environment near the top of Everest, and whose body remained on the mountain.&lt;ref name=Graveyard/&gt; The overhang or "cave"  at about {{convert|8500|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} is located alongside the main northeast climbing trail approximately {{convert|350|m|abbr=on}} below the summit and approximately {{convert|250|m|abbr=on}} above the high camps, commonly called Camp 4 above ABC, with the high camps located below the "Exit Cracks" that are just before the beginning of the Northeast Ridge route up to the summit.

The first climbers to actually encounter Sharp in the early morning on 15 May 2006 just after midnight in "Green Boots' Cave" were climbers making their summit push for later that day.&lt;ref name="usatoday30.usatoday.com"/&gt;  Most of the climbers either did not notice Sharp in the dark, thought he was just another one of the dead bodies encountered climbing Everest, or thought he was almost dead and beyond help at such an extreme altitude to even attempt a rescue. After climbers on the northern Tibetan side of Everest passed the rock overhang or "cave" in which Sharp lay incapacitated, in the early morning on 15 May 2006 and later that day during their descents, they returned with a series of accounts and events that resulted in international media attention focused on Sharp's death and the climbers who saw him there.&lt;ref name="usatoday30.usatoday.com"/&gt;

====Himex Expedition – first team====
[[Himex]] (a truncated version of the full name "Himalayan Experience") organized several teams to climb Everest during the 2006 climbing season expedition.  The first team was guided by mountain climber and guide Bill Crouse.  At about 01:00 on 14 May 2006, Bill Crouse's expedition team passed by David Sharp on his way up to the summit during their own ascent.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; They passed at a location on the common North route by a spot known as the "Exit Cracks"&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; This is on the north route above the last camps, or high camps, for groups on the ascent prior to reaching and then traversing what is referred to as the Northeast Ridge which includes ascending several "steps" prior to reaching the summit of Everest.

Around 10:00 on the morning of 14 May 2006, Crouse's Himex team reached the summit, as recorded by the Himalayan Database.&lt;ref name="himalayandatabase.com"/&gt; When Crouse's team descended, they saw Sharp again at the base of the Third Step around 11:00 on 14 May.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; By the time Crouse's expedition had descended to the Second Step, more than one hour later, they looked back to see that Sharp was above the Third Step, but was climbing very slowly and had only moved about {{convert|90|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

====Turkish team====
Another source of reports about Sharp was a team of Turkish climbers.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.everestnews.com/everest2006/davidsharp07272006.htm|title=Everest 2006: The investigation into the death of David Sharp: The Turkish Expedition speaks in detail |work=everestnews.com|accessdate=1 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; They left their high camp in the evening on 14 May 2006 at about 10:30 pm to attempt reaching the summit, and were essentially traveling in three separate groups. Late in the evening on 14 May to early morning on 15 May, the Turkish team members encountered Sharp in the dark while ascending. The first group encountered Sharp at around midnight, noticed he was alive but thought that he appeared to just be a climber taking a short break, and Sharp waved those Turkish team members on. Some time later the others who noticed Sharp thought he was just another dead climber high on the mountain, which are encountered high up on Everest where recovery of a dead climber's body is almost impossible due to the conditions.&lt;ref name="explorersweb.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Graveyard/&gt; It is thought Sharp fell asleep between these two times.&lt;ref name="explorersweb.com"/&gt; That Sharp wanted to sleep was noted by other climbers who encountered him later on, and a quote telling people that he wanted to sleep was reported in some news media stories.&lt;ref name="m.nzherald.co.nz"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m.nzherald.co.nz/world/news/article.cfm?c_id=2&amp;objectid=10383743|title='Let me sleep' plea by dying climber|first=New Zealand|last=Herald|work=nzherald.co.nz|accessdate=1 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the Turkish team summited early in the morning on 15 May 2006, and some of the team turned back near the summit due to difficulties one of the team members was having.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="himalayandatabase.com"/&gt; The Turkish team members who turned back encountered Sharp again at about 7:00 am. One of them was the Turkish team leader, Serhan Pocan, who had previously passed Sharp in the night and thought Sharp was a climber who had recently died.  In the daylight Pocan realized that Sharp was actually alive when he noticed movement of one of Sharp's arms, and also that Sharp was in serious trouble.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

They observed that Sharp had no oxygen left, had serious frostbite and that some limbs were frozen. At that time, two of the Turkish team members stayed and attempted to assist him by giving him something to drink and tried to help him move. However, these members of the team were now running out of oxygen, so they left with the intent to get more oxygen and then return. The Turkish team's initial effort to help was complicated by their own problems trying to get [[Burçak Özoğlu Poçan]] down safely; she was a climber in their group having medical problems.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;  The team leader placed radio calls to the rest of the team coming down from the summit about Sharp, and then continued descending with the Turkish climber who needed help.  At about 8:30 am two other members of the Turkish team descending cleaned out Sharp's iced up mask to try and give him some oxygen, but they started to run out of oxygen themselves and had to descend. The remaining Turkish team members later attempted to further help Sharp along with other Himex expedition members.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

====Himex Expedition – second team====
The vanguard of the second team of Himex climbers included [[Maxime Chaya|Max Chaya]], [[New Zealand]] double-[[amputee]] [[Mark Inglis]], Wayne Alexander (who designed Inglis' [[prosthetic legs|prosthetic climbing legs]]), Discovery cameraman Mark Whetu, and experienced climbing guide Mark Woodward along with their Sherpas including renowned climbing Sherpa [[Phurba Tashi]].  The team left their high camp around {{convert|8200|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} late in the evening near midnight on 14 May 2006, with Chaya and the Sherpa he was climbing with out in front by about a half hour.&lt;ref name=Journal&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mountainzone.com/2006/david_sharp/index.html|title=Left to Die on Everest|work=[[Men's Journal]]|author=Nick Heil |date=August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At about 1:00 am in the bitterly cold early morning of 15 May 2006, Woodward and his group (including Inglis, Alexander, Whetu and some Sherpas) encountered Sharp, who Woodward knew shouldn't be there.  He wasn't conscious or moving, and had severe frostbite, but they could see that he was breathing. Woodward noticed Sharp had thin gloves and no oxygen, and indicated that they yelled at Sharp to get up, get moving and follow the headlamps back to the high camps. Woodward shined a headlamp in Sharp's eyes, but Sharp was unresponsive.&lt;ref name=Journal/&gt;

Woodward thought he was almost dead and in a [[hypothermic]] [[coma]], commenting, "Oh, this poor guy, he's stuffed", and that Sharp couldn't be rescued due to his condition and the impossibility of even attempting a night-time rescue.&lt;ref name=times/&gt;&lt;ref name="washingtonpost 2006-07-30"/&gt;  Alexander commented, "God bless... Rest in peace", before the group moved on after Woodward attempted to radio their advanced base camp about Sharp but got no reply.&lt;ref name=Journal/&gt; Woodward noted that it was not an easy decision to make, but his chief responsibility was the safety of his team members (and stopping in the extreme cold at that time would have risked the lives of his team who would have also been susceptible to hypothermia or frostbite), without the possibility of even being able to attempt a rescue due to the darkness.  Woodward further noted that deciding to move on was one of the hard calls one has to make in mountaineering at {{convert|8000|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} in the death zone, given the conditions and the severe cold (due to an atmospheric low near the top of Everest that day), with Sharp being almost dead in a hypothermic coma, and that at that elevation, one has to be conscious and able to walk to even attempt a rescue.&lt;ref name="Dying for Everest"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Journal/&gt;

[[Maxime Chaya]] reached the summit at around 6:00 am on 15 May 2006.&lt;ref name="himalayandatabase.com"/&gt; During his descent Chaya and the Sherpa he was with, Dorjee, encountered Sharp a little after 9:00 am, noticed he was shivering, and tried to help him; he also notified the Himex expedition manager [[Russell Brice]] over the group's radio.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost 2006-07-30"/&gt; Chaya had not seen Sharp in the darkness of the ascent, but Chaya and Dorjee did try to help on the way down when they saw him in the daylight shivering.  Chaya observed that Sharp was unconscious but was shivering severely, and was wearing a thin pair of wool gloves with no hat, glasses or goggles. Sharp was severely frostbitten, and had frozen hands and legs, and he found only one oxygen bottle with the gauge on empty.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost 2006-07-30"/&gt;

At one point Sharp stopped shivering leading Chaya to believe he had died; then some time later he started shivering again.  They attempted to give him oxygen, but there was no response, and after about an hour Brice advised Chaya that he was running out of oxygen and that there was nothing he could do, so he needed to come down.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost 2006-07-30"/&gt; Later, Chaya told the ''[[Washington Post]]'': "it almost looks like he [David Sharp] had a death wish" and noted some issues with Sharp's climb: he went alone, tried to summit too late in the day, and had too little bottled oxygen and no radio.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost 2006-07-30"/&gt;

Soon after Chaya descended, some of the others from the second Himex group and a Turkish group encountered Sharp again during their descent and also attempted to help him as they overheard Chaya's radio calls that Sharp was still alive and shivering.&lt;ref name="Dying for Everest"/&gt;&lt;ref name="washingtonpost 2006-07-30"/&gt; Phurba Tashi, the lead Sherpa for Himex, and a Turkish Sherpa gave Sharp oxygen from a spare bottle they found, patted him to try to get circulation going and tried to give him something to drink. At one point Sharp was able to mumble a few sentences. The group tried to get Sharp to his feet, but he kept collapsing and wasn't able to stand even with assistance.  They moved Sharp into the sunlight and then descended.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost 2006-07-30"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Journal/&gt; It took the two strongest Sherpas about 20 minutes just to move Sharp about four steps into the sunlight, so they were not going to be able to get Sharp down.&lt;ref name="Dying for Everest"/&gt;

====Mark Inglis controversy====
Following David Sharp's death, [[Mark Inglis]] was initially severely criticized by the media and others, including [[Sir Edmund Hillary]], for not helping Sharp.&lt;ref name="Dying for Everest"/&gt;  Inglis stated in an interview on 23 May 2006 that Sharp had been passed by 30 to 40 other climbers heading for the summit who made no attempt at a rescue, but that he was criticized for not helping Sharp, even though he was a double amputee and was probably the least likely person to have been able to help anyone, simply because he was more well known.  Inglis said he believed that Sharp was ill-prepared, lacking proper gloves and [[oxygen]], and was already doomed by the time of their ascent. He also initially stated, "I... radioed, and Russ [expedition manager [[Russell Brice]]] said, 'Mate, you can't do anything. He's been there x number of hours without oxygen. He's effectively dead.' Trouble is, at 8500 meters it's extremely difficult to keep yourself alive, let alone keep anyone else alive".&lt;ref name="nzherald.co.nz"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/story.cfm?c_id=1&amp;ObjectID=10383276 |title=Wrong to let climber die, says Sir Edmund |author=McKinlay, Tom |date=24 May 2006 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=27 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Statements by Inglis suggest that he believed that Sharp was probably so close to death as to have been beyond help by the time the Inglis party passed him during his group's ascent and the reported radio calls to their base camp.&lt;ref name="NZ_Herald_10383436"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/story.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10383436 |title=Dying Everest climber was frozen solid, says Inglis |author=Cheng, Derek |date=25 May 2006 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=27 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However Brice, who was initially criticized for reportedly advising Inglis during his ascent to move on without assessing the situation at that time or the possibility of rescue for Sharp, denies the claim that any radio call was received about the stranded climber until he was notified some eight hours later by the [[Lebanese people|Lebanese]] climber [[Maxime Chaya]], who had not seen Sharp in the darkness of the ascent.&lt;ref name="Dying for Everest"/&gt; At this time Sharp was unconscious and shivering violently with severe [[frostbite]], and had no gloves or oxygen.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost 2006-07-30"/&gt; It was revealed that Brice kept detailed logs of radio calls with his expedition members, recorded all radio traffic, and that the Discovery channel was filming Brice during this time, all of which confirmed that Brice was first notified of Sharp being in trouble when climber [[Maxime Chaya]] contacted Brice at about 9:00 am on 15 May 2006.&lt;ref name="Dying for Everest"/&gt;

In the documentary ''Dying For Everest'', Mark Inglis stated:  "From my memory, I used the radio. I got a reply to move on and there is nothing that I can do to help. Now I'm not sure whether it was from Russell [Brice] or from someone else, or whether you know... it's just hypoxia and it's ... it's in your mind."&lt;ref name="Dying for Everest"/&gt;  It is believed that if Inglis did in fact have a radio conversation where he was told that "he's been there x number of hours without oxygen" that it must have been on Inglis' descent, as there was no way for Brice or other climbers to have known how long Sharp had been where he was found during the climbers ascent, and in July 2006 Inglis retracted his claim that he was told to continue his ascent after informing Brice of a climber in distress, blaming the extreme conditions at altitude for the uncertainty in his memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5542011|title=Amputee Lauded, Criticized for Everest Climb|work=npr.org|accessdate=1 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://outside.away.com/outside/destinations/200609/mount-everest-climbing-ethics-2.html Mount Everest Climbing Ethics | Outside Online&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061018134455/http://outside.away.com/outside/destinations/200609/mount-everest-climbing-ethics-2.html |date=18 October 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Discovery Channel]] was filming the Himex expedition for a documentary ''[[Everest: Beyond the Limit]]'', including an HD camera carried by Whetu (that became unusable during the ascent due to the extreme cold) and helmet cameras for some of the Himex Sherpas, which included footage indicating that Sharp was only found by Inglis's group on their descent. However, the group of climbers with Inglis confirmed that they did discover Sharp on the ascent, but they do not confirm that Brice was contacted regarding Sharp during the ascent. By the time the Inglis group reached him on the descent and contacted Brice they were low on oxygen and heavily fatigued, with several cases of severe frostbite and other problems on the mountain, making any rescue by them impossible.

====Jamie McGuinness====
New Zealand mountaineer [[Jamie McGuinness (mountaineer)|Jamie McGuinness]] reported about a Sherpa that reached Sharp on the descent, "...&amp;nbsp;Dawa from Arun Treks also gave oxygen to David and tried to help him move, repeatedly, for perhaps an hour. But he could not get David to stand alone or even stand resting on his shoulders ... Dawa had to leave him too. Even with two Sherpas it was not going to be possible to get David down the tricky sections below"&lt;ref name="m.nzherald.co.nz"/&gt;

McGuinness was part of an expedition that successfully climbed Cho Oyu with Sharp in 2002.&lt;ref name="everestnews2002"/&gt; He also was on the 2003 expedition to Mount Everest with Sharp and other climbers,&lt;ref name="everest1953.co.uk"/&gt; and in 2006 offered Sharp the opportunity to climb Everest with his organized expedition for little more than what he ultimately paid Asian Trekking, which Sharp declined as he wanted to climb Everest independently.&lt;ref name="times" /&gt; In the documentary ''Dying For Everest'', McGuiness noted that Sharp did not expect to be rescued ... "absolutely not, he was clear to me that he understood the risks and he did not want to endanger anyone else".&lt;ref name="Dying for Everest"/&gt;

====Discovery Channel TV series====
David Sharp was briefly caught on a camera in the morning on 15 May 2006 during filming of the first season of a television show ''[[Everest: Beyond the Limit]]'', which was filmed the same season as his ill-fated expedition.&lt;ref name="Everest: Beyond the Limit"/&gt; The footage was from the helmet camera of a Himex Sherpa who encountered Sharp, along with one of the Himex group of climbers who included Mark Inglis, during their descent on 15 May 2006, and was attempting to help Sharp along with a Turkish Sherpa.

After Sharp was given additional oxygen and attempts were made to revive him and get him walking again, he was reportedly videotaped mumbling his name, that he was from Asian Trekking, and that he just wanted to sleep.  The video from the helmet camera of Sharp and the climbers attempting to help him has not been released, reportedly as requested by Sharp's family who wanted him to be remembered as an astute mountaineer and not as an incapacitated incoherent person at the end of his life.  There is apparently no video of Sharp from the Discovery Channel videographer, Mark Whetu, who was with that Himex group videotaping Inglis' climb, as it was reported that the camera he was using became unusable due to the extremely low temperatures that day.

===Reactions===
====Sir Edmund Hillary====
[[Sir Edmund Hillary]] was highly critical of the decision not to try to rescue Sharp, as incorrectly reported by the media at that time, saying that leaving other climbers to die is unacceptable, and the desire to get to the summit has become all-important. He also said, "I think the whole attitude towards climbing Mount Everest has become rather horrifying. The people just want to get to the top. It was wrong if there was a man suffering altitude problems and was huddled under a rock, just to lift your hat, say good morning and pass on by". He also told the ''[[New Zealand Herald]]'' that he was horrified by the callous attitude of today's climbers. "They don't give a damn for anybody else who may be in distress and it doesn't impress me at all that they leave someone lying under a rock to die", and that, "I think that their priority was to get to the top and the welfare of one of the&amp;nbsp;... of a member of another expedition was very secondary."&lt;ref name="nzherald.co.nz"/&gt; Hillary also called Mark Inglis "crazy",&lt;ref name="Dying for Everest" /&gt; even though Inglis was not a guide or in charge of his group, and was a double-amputee struggling himself, with severe frostbite and problems with his oxygen.  Apparently, Hillary was just responding to initial media reports which were not correct, and Inglis' initial comments to the media, which turned out to be incorrect.

====Sharp's mother====
Linda Sharp, David's mother, however, does not blame other climbers. She has said to ''[[The Sunday Times]]'', "David had been noticed in a shelter. People had seen him but thought he was dead. One of Russell's [Brice's] Sherpas checked on him and there was still life there. He tried to give him oxygen but it was too late. Your responsibility is to save yourself&amp;nbsp;– not to try to save anybody else."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article669198.ece | location=London | work=The Times | first=Ben | last=Webster | title=Focus: Has the once heroic sport of climbing been corrupted by big money? – Times Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====David Watson====
Mountaineer David Watson, who was on Everest that season on the North side, commented to ''[[The Washington Post]]'': "It's too bad that none of the people who cared about David knew he was in trouble", because "the outcome would have been a lot different."&lt;ref name="washingtonpost 2006-07-30"&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/07/29/AR2006072900922_pf.html ''On Top of the World, But Abandoned There''], The Washington Post, 30. Juli 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Watson thought it was possible to save Sharp, and he noted Sharp had worked with other climbers in 2004, to save a Mexican climber who had also gotten into trouble.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost 2006-07-30"/&gt; Watson was alerted the morning of 16 May 2006 by [[Phurba Tashi]].&lt;ref name="washingtonpost.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/07/16/AR2006071600309_pf.html|title=Did Everest Climber Sharp Have to Die?|work=washingtonpost.com|accessdate=1 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Watson went to Sharp's tent and showed Sharp's passport to Tashi, who confirmed his identity.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost.com"/&gt; Around this time, though, a Korean team gave a radio report that the climber in red boots [Sharp] was dead.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost.com"/&gt; He had his rucksack with him, but his camera was missing, so it is not known if he summited.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost.com"/&gt;

===Fate of the body===
Sharp's body remains on the mountain, but was removed from sight in 2007.&lt;ref name= usatoday2/&gt;&lt;ref name="washingtonpost 2006-07-30"/&gt;&lt;ref name=britb&gt;{{cite web|author=Rachel Nuwer|publisher=BBC|work=BBC Future|url=http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20151008-the-graveyard-in-the-clouds-everests-200-dead-bodies|title=Death in the Clouds: The problem with Everest's 200+  bodies|date=9 October 2015|accessdate=28 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==About the 2006 Everest season==
The following week after Sharp's death, three additional climbers from Asian Trekking died during summit attempts: [[Vitor Negrete]], Igor Plyushkin, and Thomas Weber.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mounteverest.net/news.php?id=2112 "Jamie McGuiness about David Sharp: 'Crying, Dawa had to leave him'"] – mounteverest.net&lt;/ref&gt; Two Asian Trekking Sherpas and one IMG Sherpa had died earlier in the season, in the [[Khumbu Icefall]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greatoutdoors.com/published/dispatch-19-massive-collapse-in-khumbu-icefall-claims-the-lives-of-three-sherpa-climbers|title=Dispatch 19: Massive Collapse in Khumbu Icefall Claims the Lives of Three Sherpa Climbers|work=greatoutdoors.com|accessdate=20 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Washington Post'' noted that 2006 was the worst season in terms of deaths since 1996 up to that time, with at least eleven climbers on Everest dying.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost 2006-07-30"/&gt; Of the 11 deaths that season on Everest, 7 were climbers on the northeast ridge (with 4 being with Asian Trekking, along with 2 other climbers and 1 Sherpa), one died attempting to ski down the north face, and three Sherpas died on the south side (including 2 climbing Sherpas from Asian Trekking) as a result of an icefall avalanche.  Accordingly, Asian Trekking essentially lost 6 climbers of the 11 that died on Everest that season.  There was also one death of a climber on the adjacent [[Lhotse]] mountain that season.&lt;ref name="Deaths - Spring 2006"/&gt;

On 26 May, Australian climber [[Lincoln Hall (climber)|Lincoln Hall]] was found alive having been declared dead the day before. He was found by a party of four climbers ([[Dan Mazur]], Andrew Brash, Myles Osborne, and Jangbu Sherpa) who, giving up their own summit attempt, stayed with Hall and descended with him and a rescue party of over a dozen Sherpas sent up to help him down. Hall descended in reasonably good health although suffering from [[frostbite]] and the lingering effects of cerebral edema. Hall ultimately lost the tips of his fingers and a toe to frostbite,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| publisher=''Sydney Morning Herald''| url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/world/climber-walks-into-base-camp/2006/05/27/1148524925275.html| title=Climber safe, speaks to wife| date=27 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; but otherwise eventually fully recovered.  Critically, similar to other successful high altitude rescues, Hall was able to walk even though he was suffering from exposure and some degree of altitude sickness.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22345">Women with disabilities have the same health issues as any other women, such as routine [[breast cancer|breast]] and [[cervical cancer]] screening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ucp.org/resources/health-and-wellness/womens-health/ |title=Women's Health |publisher=UCP |date=2015-07-31 |accessdate=2017-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women with impaired mobility are often not given basic tests, such as weight monitoring, due to the lack of [[accessibility|accessible]] equipment.{{Sfn|Lehman|2009|p=191}}

Women with disability, especially individuals who belong to minority groups or who live in rural settings are often underserved in their healthcare needs.{{Sfn|Lin|Lin|Chu|Chen|2011|p=149}} In addition, women with disabilities are more likely to live in [[poverty]], which puts them at a greater health risk.{{Sfn|Parish|Ellison-Martin|2007|p=109}}{{Sfn|Nosek|Hughes|2003|p=228}} In general, because of a lack of [[social connectedness]] that many disabled women experience, they often become disconnected from sources of support which can include [[healthcare]] providers.{{Sfn|Nosek|Hughes|2003|p=228-229}} In [[Brazil]], women with disabilities are also less likely to seek out [[gynaecology|gynecological]] health care, due to various reasons, including cultural attitudes and cost.{{Sfn|Carvalho|Brito|Medeiros|2014|p=115}}

Article 12 of the [[United Nations]] [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women]] outlines women's protection from gender discrimination when receiving health services and women's entitlement to specific gender-related healthcare provisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women|url=https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/cedaw/text/econvention.htm|year=1979|publisher=United Nations|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Article 25 of the [[Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]] specifies that "persons with disabilities have the right to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health without discrimination on the basis of disability."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Article 25 - Health {{!}} United Nations Enable|url=https://www.un.org/development/desa/disabilities/convention-on-the-rights-of-persons-with-disabilities/article-25-health.html|website=www.un.org|accessdate=20 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because traditionally, men have been used to model and test health treatments, approaches to health services, such as [[physical therapy]], have not been properly aligned with disabled women's needs.{{Sfn|Nosek|Hughes|2003|p=225}} It wasn't until after the 1990s that [[women's health]] issues were studied in-depth in the [[United States]].{{Sfn|Parish|Ellison-Martin|2007|p=109}} In addition, researching the health issues of women with disabilities is also understudied.{{Sfn|Parish|Ellison-Martin|2007|p=110-111}} Starting in the early 2000s, health issues for people with disabilities began to be studied in the United States.{{Sfn|Wisdom|McGee|Horner-Johnson|Michael|2010|p=369}} The first long term study involving the experiences of women with disability and gynecological services was published in 2001.{{Sfn|Kaplan|2006|p=450-451}}

When disabled women need to access routine services for anything other than their main impairment(s), they can be perceived as "problematic patients" by healthcare providers.{{Sfn|Thomas|2001|p=247}} Women with disabilities have reported that they are seen through the lens of their disability first, and as a person second, by healthcare providers.{{Sfn|Thomas|2001|p=252}} One woman with [[cerebral palsy]] reported that it was perceived by her doctor that every health concern was because of her CP, including a [[toothache]].{{Sfn|Thomas|2001|p=252}} Conversely, a 2003 report  found that not only did health care providers in general have positive attitudes towards people with physical disabilities in [[Saudi Arabia]], regardless of gender and which cited that most health care professionals worldwide have positive attitudes.{{Sfn|Al-Abdulwahab|Al-Gain|2003|p=67}}

In countries with strict [[Sex segregation|gender segregation]], such as [[Saudi Arabia]], women must use women-only clinics, many of which do not have access for people with physical disabilities.{{Sfn|Aldosari|2017|p=11}}

==Sexual health and contraception==
{{see also|Sexuality and disability}}Women, including young women with disabilities, use [[Birth control|contraceptives]] for various reasons. These include for prevention of pregnancy, [[Extended cycle combined hormonal contraceptive|menstrual suppression]] or because of the use of [[Teratology|teratogenic]] medications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=|first=|date=29 September 2014|title=Contraception for Adolescents|url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/134/4/e1244|journal=Pediatrics|volume=134|issue=4|pages=e1244–e1256|doi=10.1542/peds.2014-2299|pmid=25266430|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women with [[Intellectual disability|intellectual disabilities]] (ID) are more likely to use contraceptives or even to request a hysterectomy in order to manage [[menstruation]].{{Sfn|Greenwood|Wilkinson|2013|p=3}}&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Welner|first1=Sandra L.|last2=Hammond|first2=Cassing|date=2009|title=Gynecologic and Obstetric Issues Confronting Women with Disabilities|journal=The Global Library of Women's Medicine|doi=10.3843/GLOWM.10076}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various types of contraception are available to women with disabilities, however, prescription of a specific type of birth control largely rests on the kind of disability a woman has and the types of associated side-effects of the method of contraception.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Menstrual cycles are sometimes affected by different types of disabilities.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In addition, women who become disabled later in life sometimes experience transient menstrual disorders.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Healthcare professionals are less likely to refer women with disabilities for various gynecological screenings.{{Sfn|Carvalho|Brito|Medeiros|2014|p=116}} This is an attitudinal barrier which can come from a healthcare provider's unfamiliarity with disability or because they assume women with disabilities are [[Asexuality|asexual]] in nature.{{Sfn|Kaplan|2006|p=450}} Women with disabilities are less likely than women without disabilities to receive recommended [[Pap test|Pap smears]]. Women who have a [[spinal cord injury]] above the T6 [[vertebra]] can have [[autonomic dysreflexia]] during a [[Pelvic examination|pelvic exam]] which can be life-threatening.{{Sfn|Kaplan|2006|p=453}} Women with ID are less likely to be given Pap smears because the process itself may be upsetting to the patient.{{Sfn|Greenwood|Wilkinson|2013|p=5}}{{Sfn|Drew|Short|2010|p=262}}

Women with physical disabilities may be unable to get a Pap smear if the [[examination table]] cannot be lowered.{{Sfn|Parish|Ellison-Martin|2007|p=114}} There are a number of alternative examination procedures that can be used, including knee-chest position, diamond-shaped position, M-shaped position and V-shaped position.{{Sfn|Kaplan|2006|p=451}}These alternative procedures can help accommodate women who have difficulty putting their feet into stirrups or who need greater body support.{{Sfn|Kaplan|2006|p=451}} In addition, OB stirrups can be used for additional comfort.{{Sfn|Kaplan|2006|p=452}} The [[Welner table]], designed by American [[obstetrician]]-[[gynecologist]] and [[disability rights]] activist [[Sandra Welner]], is an examination table designed with a wider range of adjustments and positions to facilitate [[accessibility]] for both patients and doctors with physical disabilities.&lt;ref name=Courant&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.courant.com/1998-03-03/features/9803030035_1_disabilities-health-care-clinics |date=1998-03-03 |first=Hilary |last=Waldman |title=New Equipment, New Outlook|newspaper=[[Hartford Courant]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Welner also compiled the handbook, ''Welner's Guide to the care of women with disabilities''. Welner died before the book was finished, Florence Haseltine completed it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1=Sandra L. Welner |editor2=Florence Haseltine |title=Welner's Guide to the care of women with disabilities|date=2004|publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|location=Philadelphia|isbn=978-0781735322}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study conducted in 1989 found that only 19% of women with physical disabilities had been counseled on sexuality in a medical setting and were rarely offered information about contraceptives.{{Sfn|Nosek|Hughes|2003|p=225}} Women with ID often lack both education about sexual health and the ability to learn about it informally.{{Sfn|Greenwood|Wilkinson|2013|p=2}} In addition, their medical providers are less likely to discuss contraception with them.{{Sfn|Greenwood|Wilkinson|2013|p=3}}

Women in [[Zimbabwe]], where people with disabilities are often treated as second-class citizens, face increased barriers in having access to services for sexual health.{{Sfn|Rugoho|Maphosa|2017|p=2}} When the National Reproductive Health Policy was implemented in 2006, women with disabilities were virtually ignored.{{Sfn|Rugoho|Maphosa|2017|p=3}} Zimbabwean women with disabilities faced negative attitudes about their reproductive health, especially from female nurses who expressed the idea that "sex was not meant for the disabled."{{Sfn|Rugoho|Maphosa|2017|p=4}}

Some disabled women have been advised to become sterilized or to have an abortion because doctors feel that they are unsuited or unfit to become mothers.{{Sfn|Thomas|2001|p=255}} In the United States, a 1927 [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] case, ''[[Buck v. Bell]]'', allowed the forced sterilization of women with intellectual disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://daily.jstor.org/when-forced-sterilization-was-legal-in-the-u-s/|title=When Forced Sterilization was Legal in the U.S.|last=Wills|first=Matthew|date=2017-08-03|work=JSTOR Daily|access-date=2017-08-03|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Singapore]], the Voluntary Sterlisation Act (VSA) was passed in 1970 and which allowed any spouse, parent or guardian of persons who are "afflicted with any hereditary form of illness that is recurrent, mental illness, mental deficiency or epilepsy" to consent to the sterilization on their behalf.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VCAlDwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA185&amp;dq=disability%20in%20singapore&amp;pg=PA170#v=onepage&amp;q=disability&amp;f=false|title=A History of Human Rights Society in Singapore: 1965-2015|last=Wong|first=Meng Ee|last2=Ng|first2=Ian|last3=Lor|first3=Jean|last4=Wong|first4=Reuben|publisher=Routledge|year=2017|isbn=9781315527406|editor-last=Song|editor-first=Jiyoung|location=New York|pages=173|chapter=Navigating Through the 'Rules' of Civil Society: In Search of Disability Rights in Singapore}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Brazil, many healthcare providers and individuals with disabilities both see sterilization as the only option for contraception.{{Sfn|Carvalho|Brito|Medeiros|2014|p=116}}

== Maternity care==
A 1996 study regarding [[Pregnancy|pregnant]] women with disability found that more than 50% of hospitals in the United States could not accommodate women with physical disabilities due to accessibility issues.{{Sfn|Lehman|2009|p=186}}

A study published in the ''[[Journal of Applied Research in Intellectual Disabilities]]'' demonstrated that pregnant women and mothers with ID benefit from the inclusion of a [[doula]] both before and after they gave birth.{{Sfn|McGarry|Kroese|Cox|2016|p=32}} This approach contrasts with "crisis driven" services that are more often given to parents who have intellectual disabilities.{{Sfn|McGarry|Kroese|Cox|2016|p=31}} Participants in the small study felt that they gained a trusting relationship with their doulas and that helped them stay calm both during labor and after.{{Sfn|McGarry|Kroese|Cox|2016|p=29}} The women were able to make better, more informed choices about their own care because of the information and support they received from their doulas.{{Sfn|McGarry|Kroese|Cox|2016|p=29}} In the [[Netherlands]], women with ID are provided support in order to become successful parents.{{Sfn|Greenwood|Wilkinson|2013|p=5}}

In planning for childcare after birth, some doctors overplan and take agency away from women with disability. Healthcare providers plan for people to do jobs for the new mother, rather than assisting the new mother or helping her adapt.{{Sfn|Thomas|2001|p=254}}

== Breast health ==
Many women with a disability do not regularly receive or are not regularly referred for [[breast cancer]] screenings.{{Sfn|Todd|Stuifbergen|2012|p=74}} Women with some physical disabilities may need to be referred to special [[mammography]] centers because most equipment is not designed to accommodate women who are unable to stand.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{Sfn|Todd|Stuifbergen|2012|p=75}} Some women with disabilities do not get breast cancer screening due to financial concerns.{{Sfn|Todd|Stuifbergen|2012|p=75}} [[Major depressive disorder|Clinical depression]] is also a complication involved in whether or not women with disabilities get annual mammograms.{{Sfn|Todd|Stuifbergen|2012|p=76}} Women who have had [[ionizing radiation]] applied to the spine during health procedures are at an increased risk of developing breast cancer.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Later life==
The model of [[successful aging]] often includes the problematic (and likely [[Ableism|abelist]]) idea of being free from chronic illness.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Molton|first1=Ivan R.|last2=Yorkston|first2=Kathryn M.|date=4 October 2016|title=Growing Older With a Physical Disability: A Special Application of the Successful Aging Paradigm: Table 1.|url=|journal=The Journals of Gerontology Series B: Psychological Sciences and Social Sciences|volume=72|issue=2|pages=290–299|doi=10.1093/geronb/gbw122|pmid=27702838|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Limited studies looking at successful aging among people with disability found that they could also age successfully, though in a somewhat different manner than non-disabled individuals.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Older women are more likely to be disabled than younger women.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The most common disability affecting elderly women worldwide is [[osteoarthritis]].{{Sfn|Mohamed|2013|p=408}} Older women who have disabilities that affect their mobility are at risk of losing contact with their communities and have poor quality of life outcomes.{{Sfn|Mohamed|2013|p=414}}

Women with physical disabilities are at a greater risk of having lower [[Bone density|bone mass]] and are at risk for [[osteoporosis]].{{Sfn|Dormire|Becker|2007|p=98}} Women with ID and [[Down syndrome]] often go through menopause at an earlier age than other women.{{Sfn|Chou|Lu|Pu|2013|p=114-115}} Women with various disabilities sometimes show different symptoms from decreased estrogen levels during [[menopause]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Loss of estrogen after menopause can also lead to a greater likelihood of [[urinary incontinence]].{{Sfn|Dormire|Becker|2007|p=100}} Treatment and therapy interventions for incontinence have not been tested or modified for women with disabilities.{{Sfn|Dormire|Becker|2007|p=100}}

'''Donate Life America''', founded in 1992 as the '''Coalition on Donation''', is a [[501(c) organization|501(c)3]] not-for-profit alliance of national organizations and 47 state-based organizations across the [[United States]] called Donate Life State Teams dedicated to educating the public and advocating for [[Organ donation|organ, eye and tissue donation]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.cnn.com/2012/05/01/health/facebook-organ-donors/|title = Facebook Encouraging Organ Donations|date = |accessdate = 2015-10-20 |website = CNN|publisher = |last = Almasy|first = Steve}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Donate Life Info {{!}} Donate Life America|url = http://donatelife.net/donate-life-info/|website = donatelife.net|accessdate = 2015-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Donate Life America is funded by contributions from the public, corporations, and affiliated organizations. The organization works toward creating a more aware and educated population on the importance of organ, eye, and tissue donation through many different mediums.

Donate Life America publishes brochures, program kits, and educational materials, along with print, radio, and television advertising in order to spread awareness. The organization also provides technical assistance and referral services, coordinates the national campaign for organ donation, identifies best practices, and leads the Donor Designation Collaborative.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Donor Designation Collaborative|url = https://www.donatelifenc.org/partner-programs/donor-designation-collaborative|website = Donate Life NC|accessdate = 2015-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current President and CEO of Donate Life America is David Fleming.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 2003, Donate Life America helped institute National Donate Life Month, which was first officially proclaimed by President [[George W. Bush]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Presidential Proclamation -- National Donate Life Month, 2003|url = https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2003/04/20030402.html|website = whitehouse.gov|accessdate = 2015-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, Donate Life America has launched awareness campaigns targeted at [[millennials]] through social media and texting campaigns.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|url = http://www.post-gazette.com/local/city/2012/02/06/Goal-of-20-million-new-organ-donors-set/stories/201202060273|website = www.post-gazette.com|accessdate = 2015-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some examples of this are the campaign on Facebook where users share one's donor status and subsequently redirect followers to their local donor registry, and the Text2DonateLife Project.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Dayton Daily News|url = http://www.daytondailynews.com/news/lifestyles/social-media-boosts-organ-donations/nPR9j/|website = daytondailynews.com|accessdate = 2015-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Donate Life ECHO is an important aspect of this organization, "Donate Life ECHO was started with the aim of giving voice to the experience of multicultural communities with donation and transplantation," says Bobby Howard, DLA board member and past president of AMAT. "To increase our educational outreach efforts and donor registrations, voices and stories from these communities need to be heard."&lt;ref&gt;America, D. L.

==Donate Life Month==
National Donate Life Month is about saving and healing lives through organ, eye, tissue and living donation. Every April, Donate Life America focuses national attention on how every individual has the potential to make LIFE possible by registering their decision to be an organ, eye and tissue donor and by considering being a living donor.

Each year, Donate Life America creates artwork for National Donate Life Month that illustrates the power of donation. The 2017 National Donate Life Month (NDLM) art uses pinwheels to tell the donation story. Pinwheels capture and pass on energy. Each Donate Life pinwheel has four sails supported by one stem. The one stem symbolizes the power of one person to save and heal lives through donation. The four sails represent organ, eye, tissue and living donation, the four ways one person can save and heal more than 75 lives through organ, eye and tissue donation, and even save a life through the gift of living donation.

Pinwheels are also symbolic of transformation, turning obstacles into opportunities. The image of the pinwheel reminds us that we all have the potential power to save and heal lives. This April, we encourage you to watch the pinwheels transform the breeze into colorful motion, think of the lives touched by donation and transplantation and register to be a donor.&lt;ref&gt;News, C. (2017, March 31). Donate Life America Celebrates National Donate Life Month.

'''Dorothea Nancy Waddingham''' (1899 – 16 April 1936) was an English nursing home matron who was convicted of murder in the United Kingdom.

==Life==
Dorothea Waddingham was born on a farm near Nottingham. She has been referred to as "Nurse" Waddingham, because the two murders she was accused and convicted of were committed in a nursing home she ran near [[Nottingham]] in England. However, she was not a qualified nurse and the only medical training she received was as a ward-maid at an infirmary near [[Burton-on-Trent]]. In 1925 she married Thomas Willoughby Leech. He was twice her age and dying of [[cancer]]. During their marriage she served two prison terms, for [[fraud]] and for theft.&lt;ref&gt;Rowland, p. 138-139.&lt;/ref&gt;  Leech died in 1930, at which time Waddingham was seeing another man named Ronald Joseph Sullivan. Sullivan had fought in [[World War I]] and had been awarded the [[Military Medal]] for gallantry and also served in [[Ireland]] after the war.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson and Pitman, p. 534; Rowland, p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt;  They would marry and have four children.&lt;ref&gt;There is some confusion about the parentage of the children. Wilson and Pitman say that Leech was the father of some children (p. 533-534) while Rowland said she only bore Sullivan children (p.149).&lt;/ref&gt;  While married to Sullivan she began to take in elderly and infirm patients, and turned her home at 32 Devon Drive, Nottingham into a nursing home.

==Activities==
Mrs Blagg, the Honorary Secretary of the County Nursing Association, approved of Waddingham's work, and arranged for Mrs Baguley who was 89 and her daughter Ada, who had [[multiple sclerosis]] or "creeping paralysis", to become patients. In February 1935 another patient named Mrs Kemp died from an illness which required large dosages of [[morphine]]. Plenty of the drug remained on the premises of Waddingham's nursing home.

Ada Baguley had made a will leaving her estate of £1,600 in trust for her mother after her death, and with the rest to be divided between two [[cousin]]s, Lawrence Baguley and Fred Gilbert, after her mother died. Ada had been informed that it was likely she would precede her mother in death. However, this will was destroyed by Ada in May 1935, and a new will created that left all the money to Dorothea Waddingham and Ronald Sullivan when Ada and her mother both died (it being in recompense for the nurse's care of them). The elderly Mrs Baguley died in the second week of May.

Ada lasted through the spring and summer of 1935. Later it was said{{by whom|date=August 2014}} that Waddingham was quite attentive to her. In September 1935 Ada received a visit from an old family friend, Mrs Alice Briggs, who spent an afternoon cheering her up. Mrs Briggs told Waddingham that she would have Ada over for tea at her home in a couple of days. But on 11 September (the next day) Sullivan advised Dr H. H. Mansfield that his patient Ada was in a [[coma]]. Mansfield came and found Ada was dead. As this was expected the doctor was not suspicious, and after getting further details from Waddingham he filled out a [[death certificate]] that Ada died of [[cardiovascular]] degeneration.

Ada had given her permission to be [[cremate]]d and if the cremation had gone through it is probable that Waddingham could not have been proved guilty of Ada's death. But for the body to be cremated needed two doctors to sign the certificate, and this could only be done after the family of the deceased was notified. Ada had noted in her will a request not to notify her relatives. Waddingham said there were no relatives, which was a lie.

Unfortunately for Waddingham, the man in charge of [[cremation]]s was Dr Cyril Banks, who was also the [[Medical Officer for Health]] in [[Nottingham]]. Banks had never thought highly of Waddingham's establishment as a so-called "nursing home", and knew there was no [[State Registered Nurse]] on the staff (as there should have been). He became suspicious at the note from Ada Baguley that authorised cremation&lt;ref&gt;Wilson and Pitman, p.534-535.&lt;/ref&gt; and ordered a [[post-mortem]]. The post-mortem found no traces of anything connected to Ada's physical conditions that could have immediately caused death. This led to an analysis of the organs of the deceased by Dr W. W. Taylor, Senior Assistant to the Nottingham Analyst. He found considerable traces of morphine (over three [[grain (measure)|grains]]) in her [[stomach]], [[liver]], [[kidney]]s and her heart.

Suspicions were now raised about the death of Mrs Baguley, and an [[exhumation]] ordered by the [[Home Office]] occurred. This was handled by Dr Roche Lynch, who found the mother had also died of [[morphine]] poisoning. This led to the arrests of Waddingham and Sullivan for the two murders.

==Trial==
Waddingham's trial started on 4 February 1936 before [[Rayner Goddard, Baron Goddard|Mr Justice Goddard]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.real-crime.co.uk/Murder1/JUDGE.HTML Real Crime]&lt;/ref&gt; Her barrister was Mr Eales,&lt;ref&gt;Rowland, p.148.&lt;/ref&gt; with the prosecution by [[Norman Birkett]] (a rarity, for Birkett normally handled criminal defence). Birkett brought out much damaging testimony, including how Ada Baguley's last meal was heavy and rich for a woman in her condition: Waddingham admitted that she gave Ada pork, baked potatoes, kidney beans and two portions of fruit pie. It was suggested as an effort to disguise the cause of death and showed a lack of concern for the patient's welfare.&lt;ref&gt;O'Donnell, p.91.&lt;/ref&gt; The result was that Waddingham was convicted of using morphine to poison Mrs Baguley and Ada. The purported motive behind the murders was to gain the Baguleys' estate. It was also revealed that Waddingham claimed that Dr. Mansfield gave her surplus [[morphine]] tablets for Ada Baguley, which that doctor denied.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson and Pitman, p.535.&lt;/ref&gt;  In trial, Sullivan was discharged for insufficient evidence, although the so-called note from Ada Baguley regarding cremation was written by him.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson and Pitman, p.534.&lt;/ref&gt;

Waddingham was found guilty on 27 February. Despite recommendation of mercy, due to her being a mother of several young children, she was hanged on 16 April 1936, having confessed to the crime shortly before her execution.&lt;ref name=Archives&gt;[http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/releases/2004/may4/highlighted.htm National archives]&lt;/ref&gt; Her execution was carried out at [[Winson Green Prison]] and her hangman was [[Thomas Pierrepoint]], assisted by his nephew [[Albert Pierrepoint]].

Waddingham was a mother of five and was still [[breastfeeding]] her 3-month old baby at the time of her execution. 10,000 people gathered outside the gaol to demonstrate against the execution, chanting "Stop this mother murder!".&lt;ref name=Archives/&gt; The protests were led by the prominent abolitionist [[Violet Van der Elst]].

The fiancé of Ada Baguley, the daughter, committed [[suicide]] after her death.&lt;ref name=Archives/&gt;

==Popular culture==
The execution is dramatised in the 2005 film ''[[Pierrepoint (film)|Pierrepoint]]'', in which Waddingham is played by [[Lizzie Hopley|Elizabeth Hopley]]. Although the film shows [[Timothy Spall]] as [[Albert Pierrepoint]] carrying out the execution, in fact the hangman was [[Thomas Pierrepoint]] (Albert's uncle); Albert acted as his uncle's assistant. Furthermore, the execution took place at [[Birmingham]]'s [[Birmingham (HM Prison)|Winson Green prison]], not [[Holloway Prison]] in [[London]] as is implied in the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Pierrepoint: A family of Executioners|last=Fielding|first=Steve|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=148|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film is also incorrect in that it depicts the execution taking place during the war years.

'''Electronic Distributed Monitoring and Evaluation Solution''' ('''EDMES''') is a system used specifically for the monitoring and [[evaluation]] of [[socio-economic]] programmes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.e-soul.co.za/PopUpDisplay.php?ObjectID={0E51EE8F-8079-4F4F-B99A-F678B6BC1470} EDMES], [http://www.e-soul.co.za/ e-Soul Technologies], [[South Africa]].&lt;/ref&gt; It is a component-based [[Information technology|IT]] solution developed to fit the requirements of diverse programmes of multiple distributed organizations.

It was initially designed and developed by [[e-Soul]] (Pty) Ltd for a [[USAID]]-funded organization ([[HOPE Worldwide]]) to monitor disparate services in [[HIV]] and [[AIDS]] projects across the continent of [[Africa]]. The EDMES solution provides an infrastructure basis for the deployment of an [[M&amp;E Framework]].

[[Open-source software|Open-source application]] used for the configuration of the solution are [[FreeBSD]], [[MySQL]], and [[Pentaho]]. A [[Crippleware]] version was made available to the sector via [[SAGONET]].{{citation needed|date=September 2009}} Other versions exists that addresses professional and enterprise requirements.

&lt;!-- Cause and diagnosis --&gt;
Endometritis is divided into acute and chronic forms.&lt;ref name=Dal2010&gt;{{cite book |last1=Dallenbach-Hellweg |first1=Gisela |last2=Schmidt |first2=Dietmar |last3=Dallenbach |first3=Friederike |title=Atlas of Endometrial Histopathology |date=2010 |publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media |isbn=9783642015410 |page=135 |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=q5iDbKMK5Q0C&amp;pg=PA135 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The acute form is usually from an [[infection]] that passes through the [[cervix]] as a result of an [[abortion]], during [[menstruation]], following [[childbirth]], or as a result of [[douching]] or placement of an [[IUD]].&lt;ref name=Dal2010/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lobo2016/&gt; Risk factors for endometritis following delivery include [[Caesarean section]] and [[prolonged rupture of membranes]].&lt;ref name=Hac2015/&gt; Chronic endometritis is more common after [[menopause]].&lt;ref name=Dal2010/&gt; The diagnosis may be confirmed by [[endometrial biopsy]].&lt;ref name=Lobo2016&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lobo |first1=Rogerio A. |last2=Gershenson |first2=David M. |last3=Lentz |first3=Gretchen M. |last4=Valea |first4=Fidel A. |title=Comprehensive Gynecology E-Book |date=2016 |publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences |isbn=9780323430036 |page=548 |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=2xN9DAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA548 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ultrasound]] may be useful to verify that there is no retained tissue within the uterus.&lt;ref name=Fer2014/&gt;

&lt;!-- Treatment and epidemiology --&gt;
Treatment is usually with [[antibiotic]]s.&lt;ref name=Hac2015/&gt; Recommendations for treatment of endometritis following delivery includes [[clindamycin]] with [[gentamicin]].&lt;ref name=Mac2015&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mackeen |first1=AD |last2=Packard |first2=RE |last3=Ota |first3=E |last4=Speer |first4=L |title=Antibiotic regimens for postpartum endometritis. |journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |date=2 February 2015 |issue=2 |pages=CD001067 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD001067.pub3 |pmid=25922861}}&lt;/ref&gt; Testing for and treating [[gonorrhea]] and [[chlamydia]] in those at risk is also recommended.&lt;ref name=Wil2016/&gt; Chronic disease may be treated with [[doxycycline]].&lt;ref name=Wil2016&gt;{{cite book |title=Williams Gynecology |date=2016 |publisher=McGraw Hill Professional |isbn=9780071849081 |edition=3 |chapter=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Outcomes with treatment are generally good.&lt;ref name=Fer2014/&gt;

&lt;!-- Epidemiology and history --&gt;
Rates of endometritis are about 2% following [[vaginal delivery]], 10% following scheduled C-section, and 30% with rupture of membranes before C-section if preventative antibiotics are not used.&lt;ref name=Gab2012/&gt; The term "endomyometritis" may be used when inflammation of the endometrium and the [[myometrium]] is present.&lt;ref name=Hub2007&gt;{{cite book |author1=Hubert Guedj |author2=Baggish, Michael S. |author3=Valle, Rafael Heliodoro |title=Hysteroscopy: visual perspectives of uterine anatomy, physiology, and pathology |publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins |location=Hagerstwon, MD |year=2007 |pages=488 |isbn=0-7817-5532-8 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The condition is also relatively common in other animals such as [[cows]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Noakes |first1=David E. |title=Arthur's Veterinary Reproduction and Obstetrics E-Book |date=2009 |publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences |isbn=9780702039904 |page=411 |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=W5TdAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA411 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Acute endometritis ==
Acute Endometritis is characterized by infection. The organisms most often isolated are believed to be because of compromised abortions, delivery, medical instrumentation, and retention of placental fragments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pregmed.org/endometritis.htm|title=Endometritis - Pregnancy Articles|author=|date=21 November 2013|website=pregmed.org|accessdate=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is not enough evidence for the use of prophylactic antibiotics to prevent endometritis after manual removal of placental in vaginal birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chongsomchai|first1=C|last2=Lumbiganon|first2=P|last3=Laopaiboon|first3=M|title=Prophylactic antibiotics for manual removal of retained placenta in vaginal birth|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=Oct 20, 2014|volume=10|issue=10|pages=CD004904|pmid=25327508|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD004904.pub3}}&lt;!--|accessdate=28 October 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Histologically, neutrophilic infiltration of the endometrial tissue is present during acute endometritis. The clinical presentation is typically high fever and purulent vaginal discharge. Menstruation after acute endometritis is excessive and in uncomplicated cases can resolve after 2 weeks of [[clindamycin]] and [[gentamicin]] [[intravenous|IV antibiotic treatment]].

In certain populations, it has been associated with ''[[Mycoplasma genitalium]]'' and [[pelvic inflammatory disease]].&lt;ref name="pmid11888591"&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Cohen CR, Manhart LE, Bukusi EA, etal |title=Association between Mycoplasma genitalium and acute endometritis |journal=Lancet |volume=359 |issue=9308 |pages=765–6 |date=March 2002 |pmid=11888591 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(02)07848-0 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0140-6736(02)07848-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sternak&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ljubin-Sternak|first1=Suncanica|last2=Mestrovic|first2=Tomislav|title=Review: Clamydia trachonmatis and Genital Mycoplasmias: Pathogens with an Impact on Human Reproductive Health|journal=Journal of Pathogens|page= 3 |date=2014|volume=2014|issue=183167|doi=10.1155/2014/183167|pmid=25614838|pmc=4295611}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Chronic endometritis ==

Chronic Endometritis is characterized by the presence of [[plasma cells]] in the stroma. Lymphocytes, eosinophils, and even lymphoid follicles may be seen, but in the absence of plasma cells, are not enough to warrant a histologic diagnosis. It may be seen in up to 10% of all endometrial biopsies performed for irregular bleeding. The most common organisms are [[Chlamydia trachomatis]] ([[Chlamydia infection|chlamydia]]), [[Neisseria gonorrhoeae]] ([[gonorrhea]]), Streptococcus agalactiae ([[Group B Streptococcus]]), [[Mycoplasma hominis]], [[tuberculosis]], and various viruses. Most of these agents are capable of causing chronic [[pelvic inflammatory disease]] (PID). Patients suffering from chronic endometritis may have an underlying cancer of the cervix or endometrium (although infectious cause is more common). Antibiotic therapy is curative in most cases (depending on underlying cause), with fairly rapid alleviation of symptoms after only 2 to 3 days.

Chronic granulomatous endometritis is usually caused by tuberculous. The granulomas are small, sparse, and without caseation. The granulomas take up to 2 weeks to develop and since the endometrium is shed every 4 weeks, the granulomas are poorly formed.

In human medicine, pyometra (also a veterinary condition of significance) is regarded as a form of chronic endometritis seen in elderly women causing stenosis of the cervical os and accumulation of discharges and infection. Symptom in chronic endometritis is blood stained discharge but in pyometra the patient complaints of lower abdominal pain.

== Pyometra ==
{{main|Pyometra}}
Pyometra describes an accumulation of pus in the uterine cavity.  In order for pyometra to develop, there must be both an infection ''and'' blockage of cervix. Signs and symptoms include lower abdominal pain (suprapubic), rigors, fever, and the discharge of pus on introduction of a sound into the uterus.
Pyometra is treated with antibiotics, according to culture and sensitivity.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9376">The '''European Society of Gene and Cell Therapy ([http://www.esgct.eu ESGCT])''' is a non-profit organisation for educational and scientific purposes. The aim of ESGCT is to promote fundamental and clinical research in [[gene therapy]], [[cell therapy]], and genetic vaccines by facilitating education, the exchange of information and technology and by serving as a professional adviser to stakeholder communities and regulatory bodies in Europe.

== History ==
ESGCT was founded in January 1992 as the European Working Group on Human Gene Transfer and Therapy (EWGT)&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cohen-Haguenauer|first=Odile|date=2013-01-01|title=A Historical View on the Creation of the European Society for Cell and Gene Therapy|url=http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/hum.2012.2524|journal=Human Gene Therapy|volume=24|issue=1|pages=4–11|doi=10.1089/hum.2012.2524|issn=1043-0342}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The Society was renamed the European Society of Gene Therapy (ESGT) in 1998&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Axelrod|first=Jonathon H.|date=1999-01-01|title=Sixth meeting of the European Working Group on Human Gene Transfer and Therapy (EWGT) Jerusalem, Israel, November 21–24, 1998|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/(SICI)1521-2254(199901/02)1:13.0.CO;2-Z/abstract|journal=The Journal of Gene Medicine|language=en|volume=1|issue=1|pages=74–76|doi=10.1002/(SICI)1521-2254(199901/02)1:13.0.CO;2-Z|issn=1521-2254}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In 2007, the Society's name was changed again to ESGCT to better reflect that the fields of gene and cell therapy can not be readily separated from one another. In 2017 ESGCT celebrated its 25th anniversary at the Annual Congress in Berlin&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/esgct/videos/1396159973754645/|title=European Society for Gene and Cell Therapy|website=www.facebook.com|language=en|access-date=2017-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.esgct.eu/Congress.aspx|title=Current Congress Information|website=www.esgct.eu|access-date=2017-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

== Mission ==
ESGCT seeks to support scientists and clinicians working in the fields of gene and cell therapy and to promote awareness and understanding of gene and cell therapy and the vast amount of related research in Europe&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.esgct.eu/About-ESGCT.aspx|title=About ESGCT|website=www.esgct.eu|access-date=2017-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.esgct.eu/About-ESGCT/Presidents-letter.aspx|title=President's letter|website=www.esgct.eu|access-date=2017-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;. For the past 25 years, the society has seen many developments in gene and cell therapy. The development of new and improved delivery vectors and advances in genome engineering have opened up new possibilities, while the knowledge gained through clinical trials and long-term follow up of patients has contributed not only to the fields of gene and cell therapy, but also to the wider medical and life sciences. With these developments, more potential applications of gene and cell therapy and more elegant and life-changing treatments than ever before are within our grasp. With these possibilities come challenges both for the field and the wider society as treatments need to make the transition from lab bench to patient bedside and ethical questions need to be answered. Through its activities, ESGCT seeks to stimulate further exchange of scientific knowledge and expertise, promote collaboration between and within clinics, academic research and the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry. Furthermore, ESGCT is committed to the training and support of young investigators entering the field and to facilitating an informed dialogue between the scientific community, policy makers and society as a whole.

== Activities ==
ESGCT organises an Annual Congress, which brings together scientists working in the fields of gene and cell therapy from throughout Europe and beyond&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.esgct.eu/Congress.aspx|title=ESGCT Congress page|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The Congress is typically held in October or November in a major European city. The Congress is a platform for highlighting the latest research and techniques through the scientific sessions, which include keynote lectures, invited speakers, selected speakers, poster sessions and exhibitions. Furthermore, the Congress is an opportunity to develop relationships and collaborations. The public day, where key concepts in gene and cell therapy along with the latest research are presented in the local language to a general audience, is an integral part of the Congress. The Congress may be organised solely by ESGCT, but is often organised in collaboration with a national society for gene and cell therapy in Europe, for example the German Society for Gene Therapy DG-GT in 2017, or with closely related scientific societies, such as the [[International Society for Stem Cell Research]] (ISSCR) in 2016&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.esgct.eu/home/Florence%20meeting%20Program%20web%281%29.pdf|title=ESGCT and ISSCR Congress|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Since 2016, ESGCT also organises an annual Spring School. This meeting is aimed at students and young investigators who are new to the field of gene and cell therapy. The Spring School aims to provide an intensive training course and the opportunity to interact with current and future leaders in the field. Recently, ESGCT has started initiatives to engage its members and the wider community, including patients and members of the public. These initiatives include a heatmap that shows the location and details of gene and cell therapy research in Europe, blogs written by the society's members and news items accessible to non-specialists available on the [http://www.esgct.eu ESGCT website].

== Board and Presidents ==
The Board of ESGCT consists of 10 eminent scientists working in the fields of gene and/or cell therapy. Furthermore, one or two graduate students may be co-opted, non-voting, members of the Board. The presidency of ESGCT normally runs for 2 years. Presidents are elected at the Annual General Meeting that takes place at the Annual Congress. The following people have been elected President of the Society&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=_jGSBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT172&amp;lpg=PT172&amp;dq=ewgt+odile&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=077VWICr9b&amp;sig=ZgzeemR0tCXQUl0BoMHVzM9wc8Y&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiGn4SyiLvUAhUHDMAKHXG8D0EQ6AEIOjAG#v=onepage&amp;q=odile&amp;f=false|title=Interdisciplinary Approaches to Gene Therapy: Legal, Ethical and Scientific Aspects|last=Müller|first=Stefan|last2=Simon|first2=Jürgen W.|last3=Vesting|first3=Jan W.|date=2012-12-06|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=9783642608292|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.weizmann.ac.il/chimera/ECgrant_partC.htm|title=EC Grant Part C|website=www.weizmann.ac.il|language=he|access-date=2017-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=GCM7gB3rPycC&amp;pg=PA540&amp;lpg=PA540&amp;dq=gansbacher+1998-2004&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=n15yS9ng6K&amp;sig=hQXjmZqiZZxNCx-Smj1uNJK-doY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj476nzhbvUAhWrI8AKHer9DZIQ6AEIJjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=gansbacher%201998-2004&amp;f=false|title=The Clinibook: Clinical gene transfer state of the art|last=Cohen-Haguenauer|first=Odile|date=2013-05-03|publisher=EDK Editions|isbn=9782842542375|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.esgct.eu/About-ESGCT/Board-Members.aspx|title=Board Members|website=www.esgct.eu|access-date=2017-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Federal Meat Inspection Act of 1906''' ('''FMIA''') is an American law that makes it a crime to adulterate or misbrand meat and meat products being sold as food, and ensures that meat and meat products are slaughtered and processed under sanitary conditions.&lt;ref name="FMIA_1906"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://legisworks.org/congress/59/session-1/publaw-382.pdf |title=Federal Meat Inspection Act of 1906 ~ P.L. 59-382 |date=June 30, 1906 |series=34 Stat. 669 ~ House Bill 18537 |publisher= Legis★Works}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These requirements also apply to imported meat products, which must be inspected under equivalent foreign standards. [[USDA]] inspection of poultry was added by the [[Poultry Products Inspection Act of 1957]]. The [[Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act]] authorizes the [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] to provide inspection services for all livestock and poultry species not listed in the FMIA or PPIA, including venison and buffalo. The [[Agricultural Marketing Act]] authorizes the USDA to offer voluntary, fee-for-service inspection services for these same species.

== Historical motivation for enactment ==
The original 1906 Act authorized the [[United States Secretary of Agriculture|Secretary of Agriculture]] to inspect and condemn any meat product found unfit for human consumption.&lt;ref name=FMIA_1906/&gt;  Unlike previous laws ordering meat inspections, which were enforced to assure European nations from banning pork trade, this law was strongly motivated to protect the American diet.  All labels on any type of food had to be accurate (although not all ingredients were provided on the label). Even though all harmful food was banned, many warnings were still provided on the container.  The law was partly a response to the publication of [[Upton Sinclair]]'s ''[[The Jungle]]'', an exposé of the Chicago [[meat packing industry]], as well as to other [[Progressive Era]] [[muckraker|muckraking]] publications of the day.&lt;ref&gt;David Greenberg. [https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/01/how-teddy-roosevelt-invented-spin/426699/?google_editors_picks=true How Teddy Roosevelt Invented Spin: He used public opinion, the press, leaks to Congress, and Upton Sinclair to reform unconscionable industries, like the meatpackers.], ''The Atlantic Monthly,'' 2016&lt;/ref&gt; While Sinclair's dramatized account was intended to bring attention to the terrible working conditions in Chicago, the public was more horrified by the prospect of bad meat.&lt;ref&gt;Powell, Jim. "Bully Boy" Crown Forum Publishing Group. 2006. p.166&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The New England magazine (1907) (14776552555).jpg|thumb|James Bronson Reynolds, 1907]]
The book's assertions were confirmed in the Neill-Reynolds report, commissioned by [[President of the United States|President]] [[Theodore Roosevelt]] in 1906.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=69670 |title = Theodore Roosevelt: "Special Message," June 4, 1906 |author1= Gerhard Peters |author2 = John T. Woolley |publisher = University of California - Santa Barbara |work = The American Presidency Project}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Roosevelt was suspicious of Sinclair's [[socialist]] attitude and conclusions in ''The Jungle'', so he sent labor commissioner [[Charles P. Neill]] and social worker James Bronson Reynolds, men whose honesty and reliability he trusted, to Chicago to make surprise visits to meat packing facilities.

Despite betrayal of the secret to the meat packers, who worked three shifts a day for three weeks to thwart the inspection, Neill and Reynolds were still revolted by the conditions at the factories and at the lack of concern by plant managers (though neither had much experience in the field).  Following their report, Roosevelt became a supporter of regulation of the meat packing industry, and, on June 30, signed the Meat Inspection Act of 1906.&lt;ref&gt;Powell, Jim. "Bully Boy" Crown Forum Publishing Group. 2006. p.167&lt;/ref&gt;

==Provisions==
The FMIA mandated the [[United States Department of Agriculture]] (USDA) inspection of meat processing plants that conducted business across state lines.&lt;ref&gt;34 Stat. 674 (amended by Pub. L. No. 59-242, 34 Stat. 1260 (1967)) (codified at 21 U.S.C. §§ 601 et seq.).&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Pure Food and Drug Act]], enacted on the same day in 1906, also gave the government broad jurisdiction over food in [[interstate commerce]].&lt;ref&gt;Pub. L. No. 59-384, 34 Stat. 768 (1906), (codified at 21 U.S.C. §§ 1-15) (1934) (repealed in 1938 by 21 U.S.C. § 392(a)).&lt;/ref&gt;

The four primary requirements of the Meat Inspection Act of 1906 were:

#Mandatory inspection of [[livestock]] before slaughter (cattle, [[sheep]], [[goat]]s, [[equine]]s, and [[swine]]);
#Mandatory [[postmortem]] inspection of every [[Cadaver|carcass]];
#Sanitary standards established for [[slaughterhouse]]s and [[meat processing]] plants; and
#Authorized U.S. Department of Agriculture ongoing monitoring and inspection of slaughter and processing operations.

After 1906, many additional laws that further standardized the [[meat industry]] and its inspection were passed.

== Preemption of state law ==
In 2012, the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] ruled in ''[[National Meat Assn. v. Harris]]'', that the FMIA preempts a California law regulating the treatment of non-ambulatory livestock.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/national-meat-association-v-brown/ National Meat Association v. Harris]. SCOTUSblog (2012-01-23). Retrieved on 2014-01-14.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In the pre-colonial era, inhabitants of what is now Ghana primarily drew their water directly from natural sources such as streams, lakes, and rivers. Prior to [[World War I]], the first public water system was established in the then [[Gold Coast (British colony)|Gold coast]] by the [[United Kingdom|British]] who were then colonizing the [[Gold Coast (region)|Gold Coast]]. In by that time the 1920s, other major towns and cities started having water systems which were built purposely to be used in some urban areas, including [[Winneba]], [[Kumasi]], and the then colonial capital [[Cape Coast]].

Ghana Water Company Limited was established on 1 July 1999, following the conversion of Ghana Water and Sewerage Corporation into a state-owned limited liability company under the Statutory Corporations (Conversion to Companies) Act 461 of 1993 as amended by LI 1648.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = GHANA WATER COMPANY LIMITED - GWCL|url = http://www.gwcl.com.gh/pgs/history.php|website = www.gwcl.com.gh|accessdate = 2015-04-22|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150506101950/http://www.gwcl.com.gh/pgs/history.php|archivedate = 6 May 2015|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bream trains students and coordinates interdisciplinary research, education, and service programming involving the Penn Schools of Nursing, Medicine, Arts and Sciences, Engineering and Applied Sciences, and Wharton to improve the health of the Atitlan community&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.upenn.edu/provost/guatemala/http://sa.oip.upenn.edu/_customtags/ct_FileRetrieve.cfm?File_ID=06057B724F0077720D017772761F01700D081B09747D006B71020477050073700E02717077710602 |title=Penn: Office of the University Provost &amp;#124; Guatemala |publisher=Upenn.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; GHI partners with Hospitalito Atitlán, a small, private, non-profit hospital in Santiago Atitlan in the western highlands of Guatemala.&lt;ref name="hospitalitoatitlan1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hospitalitoatitlan.org/ |title=Hospitalito Atitlan |publisher=Hospitalito Atitlan |date= |accessdate=2011-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Santiago Atitlan, the largest indigenous village in Central America, sits on the southern shore of beautiful Lake Atitlán. It is rugged land with three majestic volcanoes surrounded by a dense jungle. The word "atitlan" is a Mayan word that translates as "the place where the rainbow gets its colors".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atitlan.net/ |title=Lake Atitlan Guatemala |publisher=Atitlan.net |date= |accessdate=2011-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Santiago Atitlán is a poor, close-knit community of 44,220 Tz'utujil Maya speaking inhabitants, of which ninety eight percent are indigenous. The primary language for ninety four percent of the residents is Tz'utujil; however, fifty four percent speak and thirteen percent read some Spanish.&lt;ref name="upenn2"&gt;[http://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1006&amp;context=uhf_2008]{{Dead link|date=August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Residents of Santiago Atitlán are referred to as Atitecos. Eighty percent are Catholics, but the traditional Mayan beliefs have endured. Their Mayan rituals, including sacrifices, ensure that the sun, moon, and planets will continue on their paths. In the highlands of Guatemala, especially around Lake Atitlán, the Maya culture still rules. Atitecos are hard-working individuals sustained mainly by agriculture, fishing, and by tourism. According to the World Bank, Guatemala has one of the most unequal income distributions with fifty one percent of the population living on less than $2 a day and fifteen percent on less than $1 a day.&lt;ref name="state1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/2045.htm |title=Guatemala |publisher=State.gov |date=2011-07-27 |accessdate=2011-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; While over half of the population of Guatemala lives in extreme poverty, within the rural indigenous Maya areas of Santiago Atitlán this poverty level raises to ninety one percent.&lt;ref name="upenn3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.med.upenn.edu/ghi/documents/MelissaGradillaThesis.doc|title=Attitudes of the Public|author=|date=|website=www.med.upenn.edu|accessdate=7 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Guatemala's social development indicators, such as maternal and infant mortality, chronic child malnutrition, and illiteracy, are among the worst in the hemisphere. Santiago Atitlán has the worst access to healthcare in Guatemala.&lt;ref name="state1"/&gt; Childhood diseases include respiratory and diarrheal illnesses and malnutrition. In the adult population, diabetes, hypertension, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease are common occurrences.
Santiago Atitlán has the third highest maternal mortality (MM) rates in all of Guatemala. This and other indigenous communities in the Guatemala highlands suffer extremely high rates of maternal and infant mortality with many [[obstetrical complications]], and high levels of pre-eclampsia. Over a woman's lifetime, the expected maternal morbidity is 1 in 71; and maternal mortality is 290 deaths per 100,000 live births with a range of 100 to 650 deaths.&lt;ref name="state1"/&gt; In Guatemala, the most precarious living conditions, the highest fertility rates, and the smallest percentage of births attended by doctors belong to indigenous women. Approximately 80% of all childbearing women are attended by traditional birth attendants (TBA's) who have little or no formal education. A traditional birth attendant is defined as "a person who assists the mother during childbirth and initially acquired her skills by delivering babies herself or through apprenticeship. Women in Santiago Atitlán, a medically pluralistic community, remain strongly skewed towards traditional medicine, despite the associated risks.&lt;ref name="upenn3"/&gt;

Santiago Atitlán has the fourth highest malnutrition in the world and seventy percent of children in western highlands have stunted growth from chronic malnutrition. www.santiagoatitlan.com Extreme poverty and severe gastrointestinal illnesses are main contributors to malnutrition. Gastrointestinal illnesses result from contaminated water sources. In 1990, the Santiago Atitlan water supply was chlorinated after a cholera outbreak, but social determinants affect drinking water beliefs and practices among the Tz'utujil Maya. Memories of the Guatemalan Civil War and Hurricane Stan, attitudes about Lake Atitlán water, and the taste and smell of chlorinated tap water, as well as, differences in ethnicity, literacy, years of schooling, and tap water quality influence Tz'utujil Maya water preferences. Despite criticism of chlorination, ninety percent of residents do get their drinking water from household or public taps, but many still drink from contaminated sources or self treat the water. Demographic, socioeconomic, social, cultural, political, and historical factors continue to be significant determinants of water-related health. Public health water interventions need to address the inequalities related to these underlying factors in order to achieve maximum effectiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.scielosp.org/pdf/rpsp/v29n1/02.pdf|title=Criticisms of chlorination: social determinants of drinking water beliefs and practices among the Tz'utujil Maya|first1=Jason M.|last1=Nagata|first2=Claudia R.|last2=Valeggia|first3=Nathaniel W.|last3=Smith|first4=Frances K.|last4=Barg|first5=Mamie|last5=Guidera|first6=Kent D.

Both the forty four percent rates of obesity and chronic malnutrition are significant health problems. In Guatemala, twenty three percent of households contain a growth stunted child with an overweight mother. Poor diets were associated with these disparities.&lt;ref name="upenn4"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.med.upenn.edu/ghi/documents/CocaColaColonization.pdf |title=Article |website=www.med.upenn.edu |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Biomedical health professionals express increasing concern that rising consumption of soft drinks and processed foods in Mayan and Latin American lead to detrimental nutritional and health consequences. Scholars debate whether the pervading presence of Coca-Cola and Pepsi in developing countries represents "Coca-Colonization," synonymous with cultural imperialism, or cultural hybridization. Coca-Cola has been uniquely hybridized into the health beliefs, religion, culture, and environment of the Tz'utujil Maya eating patterns.&lt;ref name="upenn4"/&gt; The Atitecos have been Americanized as they have incorporated Coke into their daily drinking habits. They drink it in place of alcohol and instead of contaminated water and use it in celebrations and to cure sore throat and coughs. This dietary inclusion likely increases malnutrition, diabetes and body mass index (BMI). The BMI of the Tz'utujil Maya of Santiago Atitlán, Guatemala is positively associated schooling, income, literacy, marriage, market visits per week, and water drinking. Two-thirds of the high-income respondents were obese, whereas slightly over half of low-income respondents had either normal or underweight BMI. Public health interventions for obesity should target high income, married Atitecos who visit the market frequently.&lt;ref name="upenn2"/&gt; This coca-Colonization and cultural hybridization appear to be complementary rather than mutually exclusive processes that contribute to dietary transitions, economic development, and differential health beliefs related to soft drink consumption.

Many Global Health Programs: governmental, non-governmental (NGO), private, and voluntary organizations work to support the people of Guatemala. The World Health Organization (WHO) directs international health activities, supplies training and technical assistance, develops standards, disseminates health information, promotes research, collects and analyzes epidemiologic data, and develops systems for monitoring and evaluating health programs in Guatemala.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wpro.who.int/NR/rdonlyres/6F9A7F3A-6717-432F-92D2-F2A9DFCF3BCB/0/17_Chapter12Publichealthfunctions.pdf |title=biregional CH-10 till end (Pages 397-539).pdf |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2011-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Global Health Initiative sponsored by United States Government, targets women, newborns and children under five in Guatemala. It concentrates support efforts, aligning the NGOs and engaging the private sector in reducing maternal and infant mortality, reducing the pervasive levels of chronic malnutrition that affect fifty percent of all Guatemalan children, increasing access to voluntary family planning services, prevention of HIV and other communicable diseases and improving health systems and health services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ghi.gov/country/guatemala/documents/160169.htm |title=Global Health Initiative: Guatemala Strategy |publisher=Ghi.gov |date=2011-04-11 |accessdate=2011-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to these large organizations, private voluntary organizations contribute twenty percent of the external health aid to distressed areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imva.org |title=International Medical Volunteers Association |publisher=Imva.org |date= |accessdate=2011-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

GHI, a voluntary organization, established a partnership with the Hospitalito Atitlán in the summer of 2005, when University of Pennsylvania medical and nursing student volunteers conducted a community health assessment in Guatemala. The predecessor to Hospitalito Atitlán, Clínica Santiaguito, opened in the 1960s. The Clinica was abandoned, after the massacre of thirteen Atitecos by the Guatemalan Army in 1990, leaving the town without medical services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gslis.utexas.edu/~gpasch/tesis/pages/guatemala/otr04/hmnrts.htm |title=Santiago Atitlan, Guatemala - a Human Rights Victory |publisher=Gslis.utexas.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, K'aslimaal, a grassroots organization, began to raise funds and make plans to reconstruct the hospital. Through their efforts, Hospitalito Atitlán opened on April 1, 2005, providing in-patient, surgical, and 24-hour emergency care to the people of Santiago Atitlán. Unbelievably, barely six months after opening, on October 5, 2005, mudslides triggered by Hurricane Stan, buried Hospitalito Atitlán in eight feet of mud. The mud slide destroyed the town and killed hundreds and the area was declared a mass grave. Two Penn medical students were present during the disaster and participated in the relief efforts. Through the heroism of hospital staff and volunteers, and the generosity of donors, Hospitalito Atitlán, amazingly, re-opened just two weeks later in a temporary location. Groundbreaking for a new permanent building for Hospitalito Atitlán began on September 30, 2006. In November 2010, the first floor of the new hospital opened.&lt;ref name="hospitalitoatitlan1"/&gt;
Today, Hospitalito Atitlán is a flourishing health organization that offers curative and preventative hospital services in the poverty stricken Atitlán area. Medical care is accessible to all, with a focus on women and children. Social Workers are available to evaluate the resources of the patient and family and provide up to a one hundred percent discount for those with limited resources Local physicians, nursing, and administrative staff work closely in collaboration with volunteer medical personnel from around the world to provide a comprehensive scope of care, including the only 24/7 emergency and surgical obstetrical care within a 2-hour radius. For the many patients that speak only Tz'utujil. Hospitalito Atitlán staff translates Tz'tujil to Spanish.&lt;ref name="hospitalitoatitlan2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.hospitalitoatitlan.org/2011/08/08/guatemalan-health-initiative-2011/ |title=Hospitalito Atitlán Blog » Blog Archive » Guatemalan Health Initiative - 2011 |publisher=Blog.hospitalitoatitlan.org |date=2011-08-08 |accessdate=2011-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hospital Atitlán is truly the lifeline for the people in the remote community of Santiago Atitlan.

The mission of Guatemala Health Initiative is to work with Hospitalito Atitlán to strengthen the medical services in a socially relevant and ethically acceptable way in resource-poor Tz'ulujil Maya community of Santiago Atitlán in Guatemala. GHI collaborates with the Hospitalito Atitlán to improve the health of Atitecos by increasing clinical activities and community health promotion via community health research, personnel, and material support.&lt;ref name="upenn3"/&gt; GHI provides education through video tapes, lectures and community health projects. GHI strives to educate mothers on the importance of prenatal care, safe deliveries, and postnatal care. GHI informs residents about the pulmonary problems that arise from the open cooking fires in homes and the importance of safe drinking water. Central to the goal of GHI is to put the knowledge gained through participatory research and clinical and cultural experiences into developing effective, sustainable, and culturally sensitive health interventions.
A number of potential collaborative projects between Penn and its Guatemalan partners are being conducted or explored, including scientific and clinical training with bilateral exchanges of students and faculty, as well as research on issues related to: violence prevention, food and nutrition, road traffic safety, chronic disease and trauma treatment.&lt;ref name="upenn1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.upenn.edu/provost/guatemala/ |title=Penn: Office of the University Provost &amp;#124; Guatemala |publisher=Upenn.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, Dr. Kent Bream, students, medical school librarians, and hospital IT specialists brought the Penn mobile technology project to Hospitalito Atitlán. The Penn mobile technology project, a most promising telemedicine program, uses smart phones and other mobile technologies to improve physicians' access to clinical information in Guatemala. The smart phone technology allows images and information to be relayed to Penn doctors for instantaneous diagnosis and second opinions.&lt;ref name="hospitalitoatitlan2"/&gt; They can also use electronic devices to tap into extensive electronic medical databases and e-journals to get information on diseases and treatment options. This immediate access to medical information will advance the quality of care in this rural area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thedp.com/index.php/article/2011/04/penn_assists_guatemalan_hospitalito |title=The Daily Pennsylvanian :: Penn assists Guatemalan 'Hospitalito' |publisher=Thedp.com |date=2011-04-01 |accessdate=2011-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

GHI raises funds, procures medical supplies, and provides personnel support for Hospitalito Atitlán.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://puebloapueblo.blogspot.com/2007/06/dr.html |title=Pueblo a Pueblo |publisher=Puebloapueblo.blogspot.com |date=2007-06-09 |accessdate=2011-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Penn medical and nursing student rotations benefit both Penn and Hospitalito Atitlán. The GHI also informs the Penn community about health and human rights in Guatemala. Contributions from the Guatemala Health Initiative, a voluntary organization, positively impact both the Penn and Guatemalan communities.
Global health programs, albeit, large or small, governmental or private, although mostly valuable, must be evaluated for their tangible value. Just like a noble deed may be of great importance and worthy of high praise or it may, no matter how well-intentioned, be worthless. In all types of organizations and at all levels, volunteering or donating is not necessarily a valuable service unless it is addressing an identified need and the purpose is valid. The verifiable need must be adequately and efficiently met and it must be sustainable. Health research plays a critical role by identifying needs; developing and evaluating interventions and applying knowledge and put it into action. Monitoring and evaluating the results of the system is essential and open sharing of knowledge and communication is a main objective. Nonprofit, voluntary organizations form the bedrock of the global health care delivery system, but they are not alone in their efforts as global health care systems are pluralistic.
The Guatemala Health Initiative (GHI) of the University of Pennsylvania, through its humanitarian contributions to Hospital Atitlán and the people of the Santiago Atitlán region of Guatemala, is significant and its importance should be recognized. GHI was born of good intent, with solid direction, expanding endeavors, and is succeeding in its mission to improve the health of the indigenous people of Santiago Atitlán, Guatemala. The health care and community outreach has its roots deep in the Penn community. The earliest hospitals were founded by religious and civic communities. The Pennsylvania Hospital was founded in 1751, through the philanthropic efforts of Benjamin Franklin, founder of the University of Pennsylvania. GHI carries on this proud Penn tradition in its mission to improve access to healthcare for the people of rural Guatemala. Through education, research, medical care, and the use of new technologies, GHI continues to advance the health of the Santiago Atitlán people, primarily through its support of the Hospitalito Atitlán, an essential part of the vulnerable community's safety net.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4061">'''Health For All''' is a programming goal of the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO), which envisions securing the health and well being of people around the world that has been popularized since the 1970s. It is the basis for the World Health Organization's [[primary health care]] strategy to [[health promotion|promote health]], human dignity, and enhanced quality of life.

== Definition ==
&lt;!--≥== Definition==--&gt;

[[Halfdan Mahler]], Director General (1973-1983) of the WHO, defined Health For All in 1981, as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Mahler, Halfdan (1981) "The meaning of Health For All by the year 2000", World Health Forum, Vol. 2, No. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Health For All means that health is to be brought within reach of everyone in a given country. And by "health" is meant a personal state of well being, not just the availability of health services – a state of health that enables a person to lead a socially and economically productive life. Health For All implies the removal of the obstacles to health – that is to say, the elimination of [[malnutrition]], ignorance, contaminated [[drinking water]] and unhygienic housing – quite as much as it does the solution of purely medical problems such as a lack of doctors, hospital beds, drugs and  [[vaccines]].
*Health For All means that health should be regarded as an objective of [[economic development]] and not merely as one of the means of attaining it.
*Health For All demands, ultimately, [[literacy]] for all. Until this becomes reality it demands at least the beginning of an understanding of what health means for every individual.
*Health For All depends on continued progress in medical care and [[public health]]. The health services must be accessible to all through [[primary health care]], in which basic medical help is available in every village, backed up by referral services to more specialised care. [[Immunisation]] must similarly achieve universal coverage.
*Health For All is thus a holistic concept calling for efforts in [[agriculture]], industry, education, housing, and [[communications]], just as much as in medicine and public health. Medical care alone cannot bring health to in hovels. Health for such people requires a whole new way of life and fresh opportunities to provide themselves with a higher standard of living.

The adoption of Health For All by government, implies a commitment to promote the advancement of all citizens on a broad front of development and a resolution to encourage the individual citizen to achieve a higher quality of life.

The rate of progress will depend on the political will. The [[World Health Assembly]] believes that, given a high degree of determination, Health For All could be attained by the year 2000. That target date is a challenge to all WHO's Member States.

The basis of the Health For All strategy is primary health care.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Two decades later, WHO Director General [[Lee Jong-wook]] (2003–2006) reaffirmed the concept in the ''[[World Health Report]] 2003'':&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization. [http://www.who.int/whr/2003/en/overview_en.pdf ''Overview of the World Health Report 2003: Shaping the future''] Geneva, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Health for all became the slogan for a movement. It was not just an ideal but an organizing principle: everybody needs and is entitled to the highest possible standard of health. The principles remain indispensable for a coherent vision of [[global health]]. Turning that vision into reality calls for clarity both on the possibilities and on the obstacles that have slowed and in some cases reversed progress towards meeting the health needs of all people. We have a real opportunity now to make progress that will mean longer, healthier lives for millions of people, turn despair into realistic hope, and lay the foundations for improved health for generations to come.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Jacques Herbrand''' (12 February 1908 – 27 July 1931) was a French mathematician. Although he died at age 23, he was already considered one of "the greatest mathematicians of the younger generation" by his professors [[Helmut Hasse]], and [[Richard Courant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Chevalley |first=Claude |last2=Lautman |first2=Albert |title=Logical Writings |chapter=Biographical Note on Jacques Herbrand |editor-last=Goldfarb |editor-first=Warren D. |editor2-last=Van Heijenoort |editor2-first=Jean |location=Berlin |publisher=Springer |year=1971 |pages=21–23 |isbn=90-277-0176-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He worked in [[mathematical logic]] and [[class field theory]]. He introduced [[recursion#Functional recursion|recursive function]]s. ''[[Herbrand's theorem]]'' refers to either of two completely different theorems. One is a result from his doctoral thesis in [[proof theory]], and the other one half of the [[Herbrand–Ribet theorem]]. The [[Herbrand quotient]] is a type of [[Euler characteristic]], used in [[homological algebra]]. He contributed to [[Hilbert's program]] in the foundations of mathematics by providing a constructive consistency proof for a weak system of arithmetic. The proof uses the above-mentioned, proof-theoretic Herbrand's theorem.

==Biography==
Herbrand finished his doctorate at [[École Normale Supérieure]] in Paris under [[Ernest Vessiot]] in 1929. He joined the army in October 1929, however, and so did not defend his thesis at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]] until the following year. He was awarded a [[Rockefeller Foundation|Rockefeller fellowship]] that enabled him to study in Germany in 1931, first with [[John von Neumann]] in Berlin, then during June with [[Emil Artin]] in Hamburg, and finally with [[Emmy Noether]] in [[Göttingen]].

He submitted his principal study of proof theory and general recursive functions "On the consistency of arithmetic" early in 1931. While the essay was under consideration, [[Gödel]]'s "On formally undecidable sentences of ''Principia Mathematica'' and related systems I" announced the impossibility of formalizing within a theory that theory's consistency proof. Herbrand studied Gödel's essay and wrote an appendix to his own study explaining why Gödel's result did not contradict his own. In July of that year he was mountain-climbing in the French [[Alps]] with two friends when he fell to his death in the granite mountains of [[Massif des Écrins]]. "On the consistency of arithmetic" was published posthumously.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9788">The '''Jukes family''' was a [[New York (state)|New York]] "hill family" studied in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.  The studies are part of a series of other family studies, including the [[Kallikaks]], the Zeros and the Nams, that were often quoted as arguments in support of [[eugenics]], though the original Jukes study, by [[Richard L. Dugdale]], placed considerable emphasis on the environment as a determining factor in criminality, disease and poverty ([[euthenics]]).

==Harris' reports==
Elisha Harris, a doctor and former president of the American Public Health Association, published reports that Margaret, in Upstate New York, was the "mother of criminals" and he described her children as "a race of criminals, paupers and harlots".
&lt;ref name=vergano&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/tech/science/columnist/vergano/story/2012-07-02/eugenics-jukes-family/55944082/1 |newspaper=USA Today |date=2012-06-30|author=Dan Vergano|title=Most Popular E-mail Newsletter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dugdale's study ==
In 1874, [[sociologist]] [[Richard L. Dugdale]], a member of the executive committee of the Prison Association of [[New York (state)|New York]], and a colleague of Harris' was delegated to visit jails in [[upstate New York]].&lt;ref name=vergano/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; In a jail in [[Ulster County, New York|Ulster County]] he found six members of the same "Juke" family (a pseudonym), though they were using four different family names.  On investigation he found that, of 29 male "immediate blood relations", 17 had been arrested, and 15 convicted of crimes.&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{Citation

He studied the records of inmates of the thirteen county jails in [[New York State]], as well as poorhouses and courts, while researching the New York hill family's ancestry in an effort to find the basis for their criminality.  His book claimed Max, a frontiersman who was the descendant of early Dutch settlers and who was born between 1720 and 1740,&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; had been the ancestor of more than 76 convicted criminals, 18 brothel-keepers, 120 prostitutes, over 200 relief recipients, and 2 cases of "feeble-mindedness".&lt;ref name=keely&gt;{{Citation

Many of the criminals could also be linked to "Margaret, the Mother of Criminals", renamed "Ada" in his report, who had married one of Max's sons.&lt;ref name=vergano/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;  Dugdale created detailed genealogical charts and concluded that poverty, disease, and criminality plagued the family.  Dugdale estimated to the [[New York legislature]] that the family had cost the state $1,308,000. He published his findings in ''The Jukes: A Study in Crime, Pauperism, Disease and Heredity'' in 1877.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;
Dugdale debated the relative contribution of environment and heredity and concluded that the family's poor environment was largely to blame for their behavior:  "environment tends to produce habits which may become hereditary" (page 66). He noted that the Jukes were not a single family, but a composite of 42 families and that only 540 of his 709 subjects were apparently related by blood.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;

He urged public welfare changes and improvements in the environment in order to prevent criminality, poverty and disease, writing: "public health and infant education... are the two legs upon which the general morality of the future must travel"(page 119).&lt;ref name="keely" /&gt; The book was widely read in the nineteenth century and stimulated discussion about the roles of heredity and environment.&lt;ref name =estabrook&gt;{{Citation

Legal historian [[Paul A. Lombardo]] states that very soon the Jukes family study was turned into a "genetic morality tale" which combined religious notions of the sins of the father and eugenic pseudoscience.&lt;ref name=vergano/&gt;

==Estabrook's study==
A follow-up study was published by Arthur H. Estabrook of the [[Eugenics Record Office]] at [[Cold Spring Harbor, New York]] in 1916 as ''The Jukes in 1915''.  Estabrook noted that Dugdale's conclusions were that the 1877 study "does not demonstrate the inheritance of criminality, pauperism, or harlotry, but it does show that heredity with certain environmental conditions determines criminality, harlotry, and pauperism".&lt;ref name =estabrook/&gt;  Estabrook reanalyzed Dugdale's data and updated it to include 2,820 persons, adding   2,111 Jukes to the 709 studied by Dugdale.  He claimed that the living Jukes were costing the public at least $2 million.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;

Estabrook's data suggested that the family had actually shown fewer problems over time, but he pronounced that the Jukes family were  "unredeemed" and suffering from just as much "feeblemindedness, indolence, licentiousness and dishonesty" as they had been in the past.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; Strongly emphasizing heredity, Estabrook's conclusions reversed Dugdale's argument about the environment, proposing that such families be prevented from reproducing, since no amount of environmental changes could alter their genetic inheritance towards criminality.&lt;ref name="keely"/&gt;

Photographs of members of the Jukes family and their homes as well as family trees of some branches of the Jukes family were displayed at the Second International Congress of Eugenics, held at the [[American Museum of Natural History]] in New York City in 1921.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; 
Historians have noted that Dugdale's conclusions have been misused by subsequent generations: "Estabrook's version is the one that carried the day. After 1915, the Jukes cames to symbolize the futility of social change and the need for eugenic segregations and sterilization".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

American scientists, doctors, politicians, clergy and the legal profession all embraced the eugenic movement, and the Jukes family research was used as evidence in [[Buck v. Bell]] a 1927 [[US Supreme Court]] case which made forced sterilizations legal in the United States.&lt;ref name=vergano/&gt;  In the 1930s eugenics was widely repudiated by geneticists, and after the Nazi World War II eugenics program became known, its influence died out.&lt;ref name=vergano/&gt;

==Further research==
Research in the 1960s pointed out fundamental problems with the studies, such as the subjects were not one family and not necessarily related. In addition, the attempt to link a trait such as poverty to genetic makeup, ignoring environmental issues, has been "totally discredited", as noted by geneticist Andrés Ruiz Linares in a 2011 historical review.&lt;ref name=vergano/&gt;

In 2001 a [[poorhouse]] graveyard was discovered in [[New Paltz]], in Ulster County. Some of the unmarked graves belonged to members of the so-called Jukes family. Further information was found in the archives at the [[State University of New York at Albany]] and in records of a forgotten Ulster County poorhouse. A code book, labeled "classified", was found and listed the real surnames of the "Jukes" family.  Hundreds of names were listed, including Plough, Miller, DuBois, Clearwater, Bank and Bush. Max, the "founder", was identified as Max Keyser.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;
However, "the mythology of so-called 'genetically problematic families' is still with us," said Paul A. Lombardo of the Center for Biomedical Ethics at the University of Virginia. "Even today, the Jukeses seem to be getting a third life on the Internet as we see some religious and political groups invoking them as examples of inherited immorality."&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;

'''Kalipada Pahan''' is a Professor of Neurological Sciences, Biochemistry and Pharmacology, and the Floyd A. Davis, M.D., Endowed Chair in Neurology in [[Rush University Medical Center]]. He is also a Veterans Affairs (VA) Scientist at the Jesse Brown VA Medical Center. He is an eminent Indian American neuroscientist involved in translational research on multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, dementia, and Batten disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pahanlab.com |title=Home |publisher=Pahanlab.com |date= |accessdate=2014-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is known for his research on [[statins]], cholesterol-lowering drugs. He first explored the application of statins in suppressing the inflammatory events in microglia, astroglia and macrophages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.jci.org/articles/view/119812 |title=Lovastatin and phenylacetate inhibit the induction of nitric oxide synthase and cytokines in rat primary astrocytes, microglia, and macrophages |doi=10.1172/JCI119812 |publisher=J Clin Invest|volume=100|issue=11|pages=2671–2679 |date=1997-12-01 |accessdate=2014-02-03|author=K Pahan|others= F G Sheikh, A M Namboodiri and I Singh |pmid=9389730 |pmc=508470}}&lt;/ref&gt; This finding has revolutionized the research on statin drugs. Later his lab has shown that statins may be beneficial in protecting neurons and improving locomotor activities in Parkinson's disease by suppressing the activation of [[Ras subfamily|p21/Ras]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Ghosh A|others=Roy A, Matras J, Brahmachari S, Gendelman HE, Pahan K.|title=Simvastatin inhibits the activation of p21ras and prevents the loss of dopaminergic neurons in a mouse model of Parkinson's disease.|journal=J.

Recently his lab has delineated a unique crosstalk between fat and memory in which the lipid-lowering transcription factor PPARalpha controls the formation of hippocampal memory via transcriptional regulation of CREB (Roy et al., 2013, Cell Reports 4: 724-737), suggesting a possible reason for the connection between excess belly fat and memory loss.

He has written many book chapters and published more than 160 papers in many peer-reviewed journals including  Journal of Biological Chemistry,  Journal of Immunology, Journal of Neuroscience, Cell Death and Differentiation, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the USA, Journal of Clinical Investigation, Cell Reports, Cell Metabolism, and Nature Chemical Biology. He is the recipient of "D. H. Reinhardt Scholar" award from the University of Nebraska Medical Center (UNMC) College of Dentistry, the "Silver U" award from the UNMC Chancellor's council, and the outstanding teaching award from the UNMC College of Dentistry. He also received the Zenith Fellows Award from the Alzheimer's Association.

'''Kashinhou''' (化審法), short for {{nihongo|化学物質の審査及び製造等の規制に関する法律|Kagaku Busshitsu no Shinsa Oyobi Seizoutou no Kisei ni Kansuru Houritsu}}, ("Law Concerning the Examination and Regulation of Manufacture, etc. of Chemical Substances") (Showa Act No. 117, 昭和48年法律第117号) is the current Chemicals and dangerous substances regulation law in Japan.  The more concise abbreviated name is {{nihongo|化学物質審査規制法|Kagaku Busshitsu Shinsa Kiseihou}}, or "Chemical Substances Control Law". This law featured the world's first new chemical pre-examination system.

== Coverage ==
This law was established to provide a framework to examine the import, manufacture, and use of industrial chemicals and refractory organic substances for persistence and health consequences, as well as the necessary legal restrictions in order to achieve those aims.

== History ==
The law has its origins in 1968, with an illness related to [[polychlorinated biphenyls]] poisoning in the [[Kanemi Oil Incident]]. In 1973, this law was established, radically overturning a prevailing attitude that long term contaminants bioaccumulating in humans was not problematic. Refractory organic substances, highly enriched uranium, and substances that possess long term toxicity to humans were classified as Section 1 Chemical Substances. Section 1 items were banned from manufacture or importation.

In 1986, a Section 2 Chemical Substances was added, which included [[trichloroethylene]] and [[tetrachloroethylene]], which had contaminated groundwater. Questionable chemical substances that did not fall into above categories were introduced into a Section 2 Questionable Chemical substances category.

In 1999, the government ministries were reorganized, and the [[Ministry of the Environment (Japan)|Ministry of the Environment]] was added as an overseer to the precursor ministries of the current [[Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare]], [[Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry]].

In 2003, under pressure from the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]], a third Section was created to surveillance of chemical substances harmful to flora and fauna but not to humans.

Regulation, policing, and surveillance of other laws, namely the Poisonous and Deleterious Substance Control Law, Stimulant Control Law, and Narcotics and Psychotropics Control Law were transferred to the current ministries as mentioned above.

'''Kedung Ombo Reservoir''' is one of the major reservoirs in [[Indonesia]] . It is located on the border of three regencies in [[Central Java]]  Province namely [[Grobogan Regency]] , [[Sragen Regency]] and [[Boyolali Regency]] precisely in District Geyer , Grobogan District . The main dam of Kedungombo Reservoir is located on the border of Rambat Village and Juworo Village , Geyer Sub-District , Grobogan District . This reservoir uses [[Serang River]] as its main source of water for a moment with the Uter / Sungai Kombo / Banjaran River. Other water sources are supplied from several large and small rivers that supply water to Kedungombo Reservoir, including Braholo River, Central River, Nglanji River, Tapen River and Sambas River.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2015/08/03/ri-prepares-worst-el-ni-o-causes-prolonged-dry-season.html|title=RI prepares for worst as El NiÃ±o causes prolonged dry season|newspaper=The Jakarta Post|accessdate=5 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Development==
In 1985 the government planned to build a new reservoir in Central Java for a 22.5 Megawatt (MW) power plant and could accommodate water for the surrounding 70 Hectare rice fields. The construction of Kedungombo Reservoir is funded by USD 156 million from the World Bank, USD 25.2 million from Japan Exim Bank, and APBN, starting from 1985 until 1989. The reservoir began to be irrigated on January 14, 1989. Cangkupan puddle reservoir reaches 6,576 hectares (Waters 2,830 hectares and land area 3.746 hectares) by drowning 37 villages, 7 districts in 3 districts, namely Sragen, Boyolali, Grobogan. A total of 5,268 families at that time lost their land due to the construction of this dam. This reservoir was finally inaugurated by President Soeharto, May 18, 1991. Events refusal of displacement and resettlement of residential location by residents because the land will be used as Reservoir Kedungombo because the small amount of compensation is given known as Kedung Ombo Case.
==Utilization==
* Irrigation: With a pool area of ± 4,500 Ha and a normal water reservoir volume of 723 million M3, Kedungombo Reservoir is able to irrigate more than 60 thousand hectares of agricultural land in Grobogan District , Demak Regency , Kudus Regency , Pati Regency and Jepara Regency . The area is served from three weirs along the Kali Serang of Bendore Sidorejo, Bend Sedadi and Klambu Dam, which is a river that has been used as a channel to drain the water of Kedungombo Reservoir since the first of January 14, 1989 until now. For irrigation water needs served by taking into account the effect of water availability on other rivers downstream of the reservoir and also calculated the lateral flow of the Water Catchment Area (DTA) on the regulating gates of the Bend.

In [[France]], the '''Melun Act''' (1850–1851) was one of the first laws regarding [[Public Health]]. It was presented by the Viscount André de [[Melun]].

It introduced a range of measures regarding unhealthy and unfit for habitations buildings. The law was actually optional, and was only fully applied in [[Paris]] by [[Baron Haussmann]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9147">'''Minimal intervention dentistry''' is a modern dental practice designed around the principal aim of preservation of as much of the natural tooth structure as possible. It uses a disease-centric philosophy that directs attention to first control and management of the disease that causes tooth decay&amp;mdash;[[dental caries]]&amp;mdash;and then to relief of the residual symptoms it has left behind&amp;mdash;the decayed teeth. The approach uses similar principles for prevention of future caries, and is intended to be a complete management solution for tooth decay.

==History==

Classical [[restorative dentistry]] has traditionally followed the century old approach of [[Greene Vardiman Black|GV Black]] in classification and treatment of [[tooth decay]]. This was based on very limited knowledge at the time about the pathology of the underlying [[dental caries]] disease, and the need to specially prepare a cavity to repair a lesion (decayed area) with the limited available materials. Therefore, the only approach was to treat the symptoms&amp;mdash;to remove the decay and restore the tooth surgically. Modern science has since allowed for better understanding of the pathology, thus opening the door for new methodologies and approaches to treatment. The practice of minimal intervention dentistry was designed to utilise these new possibilities by implementing a disease-centric philosophy to management of tooth decay. While advances in dental science are of course used in mainstream dental practice, MI dentistry has redesigned the treatment guidelines beginning with a new classification of caries lesions. This classification was intended to reflect the possibility of curing the disease and remineralising (hardening) early lesions before irreversible damage has been done. It was first published by Mount and Hume in 1997&lt;ref name="Quint 97"&gt;{{citation | title = A new classification for dentistry | author = Mount GJ, Hume RW | journal = [[Quintessence International]]|year= 1997 |volume=28 |pages=301–303}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has subsequently been revised.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title="Preservation and Restoration of tooth structure" 2nd edition | author=Mount GJ, Hume WR | year= 2005 | isbn=1-920824-74-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some see MI dentistry as merely a philosophical change, but since the practice has been in mainstream discussion in the late 90s it has acquired some respectable international academic backing.

==Approach to restorative dentistry==

The approach of minimal intervention dentistry is centred on management of the [[dental caries]] disease responsible for [[tooth decay]], first ''controlling and curing'' the disease, then ''restoring'' the tooth, filling only where necessary, and finally ''prevention'' from future caries.

===Treatment: controlling and curing===

Classical dietary and [[oral hygiene]] techniques of reducing sugar content and eating frequency, and removing plaque by effective brushing, are still very important practices for treatment as well as prevention. Also, biochemical techniques can be used to treat the bacterial infection directly.{{Clarify|date=April 2009}} Agents such as [[chlorhexidine]] can help fight gum disease and thus reduce the amount of bacteria in the mouth that are responsible for tooth decay. After a wave of empirical studies on the efficacy of [[Xylitol]] (a [[sugar alcohol]]) a consensus report in the ''British Dental Journal'' considered it to give a reduction in the risk of caries.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title = Xylitol cleared for anti-caries health claims | url = http://www.nature.com/bdj/journal/v206/n3/full/sj.bdj.2009.91.html | journal = British Dental Journal |year=2009 |volume=206 |page=123 | doi=10.1038/sj.bdj.2009.91}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also increasing use of newer technologies such as ''photo-activated disinfection'' and treating with ozone.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title=Restorative Dentistry: An Integrated Approach | first=Peter | last=Jacobsen | year=2008 | isbn=1-4051-6799-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also an aspect of minimising the effect of the caries to control the symptoms of decay. Constant ''remineralisation'' (hardening) with continuous application of [[Fluoride therapy|fluoride]] toothpaste is highly common practice that reduces the impact of the caries on decay. Changing the biochemical properties of saliva, potentially through the use of appropriate drugs, can help the [[buffer capacity|buffering capacity]] of the saliva to resist changes in [[pH]] caused by [[dental plaque|plaque]] acid, resisting the acid attack caused by the active caries.

===Restoration===

Decay is the process or result of ''demineralisation'' (softening) of an area of dental tissue, creating a decayed ''lesion'' on the tooth. The process of restoring decay begins with an analysis of the decayed lesions together with their location and severity, with particular regard to the state of reversibility. Where decay is reversible, it is referred to as ''non-cavitated'' decay, where healing is possible by the hardening process of ''remineralisation''. Where a ''cavity'' has formed from excessive demineralisation, the decay has reached the point of no return where the tooth structure has been lost and the decay is permanent and non-reversible. In this situation of ''cavitated'' decay, the cavity will have to be filled to restore the tooth. Minimal intervention dentistry is focused on filling only cavitated regions, leaving non-cavitated decay to be remineralised, thus restoring the tooth while removing as little of the tooth structure as possible, enhancing the strength and aesthetics of the restoration.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. {{citation | title = Resin composite contours | author = H. Sidelsky | url = http://www.nature.com/bdj/journal/v208/n9/abs/sj.bdj.2010.398.html | journal = British Dental Journal |year=2010 |volume=208 |page=10 | doi=10.1038/sj.bdj.2010.398}}&lt;/ref&gt; Classifications of the location and severity of decay are made in order to establish guidelines for suitable treatment methods.

====Identification and classification of carious lesions====

The minimal intervention approach to classification was originally introduced by GJ Mount and RW Hume in ''“A new classification for dentistry”'',&lt;ref name="Quint 97" /&gt; and later modified by other journal articles and books mainly by Mount and Hume. This classification aims to provide a useful guide to the clinical approach required in treatment, depending on the characteristics of the lesion.&lt;ref&gt;Classification grid &amp;mdash; http://www.midentistry.org/grid.html#newclassification&lt;/ref&gt; The first stage is to determine cavitation, then followed by determining the restorative approach to any cavitated areas, with suitable treatment for remineralisation of the non-cavitated areas.

====Remineralisation of non-cavitated lesions====

Various techniques exists for remineralisation, varying from simple application of [[Fluoride therapy|fluoride]] to using special substances for filling materials that interact with the tooth to aid the process from within. [[Glass ionomer cement|Glass Ionomer Cements]] (GICs) have been shown to undergo ion exchange with the surrounding tooth structure, and also engage in fluoride feeding. Research by Prof. Hien Ngo and others has shown that these methods can in practice heal some non-cavitated lesions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title=Chemical exchange between glass-ionomer restorations and residual carious dentine in permanent molars: An in vivo study | author1= Hien Ngo| author2=Graham Mount | author3=John Mc Intyre | author4=J. Tuisuva | author5=R.J. Von Doussa | publisher=ScienceDirect, Journal of Dentistry 34 (2006) 608-613}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prevention===

The same methods for cure of the disease can be used for prevention, as well as other techniques such as the use of fissure sealants in high risk individuals.

In Québec, the [[Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms]] recognizes the fundamental rights and freedoms of all individuals, whatever their age. These rights include:
*the right to life and personal security;
*the right to personal inviolability and freedom;
*the right to receive assistance when their life is in peril.
In addition, the Charter specifically recognizes that every child has a right to the protection, security and attention that his or her parents, or the persons acting in their stead, are capable of providing.

The Youth Protection Act came into force in 1979. In 1995, the Commission, in addition to the duties defined in the Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms, was made responsible for taking action to ensure respect for the rights of children and adolescents, as defined in the Youth Protection Act.

The [[Youth Criminal Justice Act]] applies to young people aged 12 to 17 who commit an offence under the Criminal Code or another federal law (theft, vandalism, break and enter, possession of drugs, etc.).

'''Mucinous cystadenoma''' is a benign cystic tumor lined by a mucinous epithelium. It is a type of cystic [[adenoma]] ([[cystadenoma]]).

Mucinous cystadenomata may arise in a number of locations; however, mucinous cystadenoma at different locations are not generally considered to be related to one another.

==Overview==
Mucinous cystadenomas may be found in the: 

*[[Ovary]]—[[ovarian mucinous cystadenoma]]
*[[Pancreas]]—[[pancreatic mucinous cystadenoma]]
*[[Peritoneum]]—[[peritoneal mucinous cystadenoma]]
*[[Liver]]—[[mucinous cystadenoma of the liver]]&lt;ref&gt; {{Cite journal  | last1 = Grubor | first1 = NM. | last2 = Colovic | first2 = RB. | last3 = Atkinson | first3 = HD. | last4 = Micev | first4 = MT. | title = Giant biliary mucinous cystadenoma of the liver. | journal = Ann Hepatol | volume = 12 | issue = 6 | pages = 979-83 | doi =  | PMID = 24114831 | year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*[[Vermiform appendix]]—[[appendiceal mucinous cystadenoma]] (see [[cystadenoma]])

==Ovarian mucinous cystadenoma==
Mucinous cystadenomas make up 15–20% of all ovarian tumors. They often become very large and can extend up into the abdomen. 

These tumors are usually evaluated using ultrasound, CT scan, or MRI. Findings on imaging studies are nonspecific. These ovarian tumors are usually multi-septated, cystic masses with thin walls. They also contain varying amounts of solid tissue which consists of proliferating stromal tissue, papillae, or malignant tumor cells. 

Benign mucinous cystadenomas compose 80% of mucinous ovarian tumors&lt;ref name=pmid15626914&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hart WR |title=Mucinous tumors of the ovary: a review |journal=Int. J. Gynecol. Pathol. |volume=24 |issue=1 |pages=4–25 |date=January 2005  |pmid=15626914 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 20–25% of benign ovarian tumors overall. The peak incidence occurs between 30 and 50 years of age. Benign tumors are bilateral in 5–10% of cases.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5506">A '''National Health Service trust''' is an organisation within the [[National Health Service (England)|English NHS]] generally serving either a geographical area or a specialised function (such as an ambulance service). In any particular location there may be several trusts involved in the different aspects of healthcare for a resident.
==Nature of a trust==
NHS trusts were established under the [[National Health Service and Community Care Act 1990]] and were set up in five waves.  Each one was established by a [[Statutory Instrument]].

The trusts are not [[Trust law|trusts]] in the legal sense but are in effect public sector corporations. Each trust is headed by a [[board of directors|board]] consisting of [[executive director|executive]] and [[non-executive director]]s, and is [[chairman|chaired]] by a non-executive director. There were about 2,200 non-executives across 470 organisations in the NHS in England in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Make the most of non-executives and the independent sector|url=http://www.hsj.co.uk/resource-centre/supplements/supplement-make-the-most-of-non-executives-and-the-independent-sector/5085356.article#.VYFl2ba_UYA|accessdate=17 June 2015|publisher=Health Service Journal|date=28 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Non-executive directors are recruited by open advertisement. All trusts ([[NHS foundation trust|Foundation trusts]] and those which have yet to reach foundation trust status) are regulated by [[NHS Improvement]]. Board members are, from November 2014, subject to a [[Fit and proper person test]].

All trust boards are required to have an audit committee consisting only of non-executive directors, on which the chair may not sit. This committee is entrusted not only with supervision of financial [[audit]], but of systems of [[corporate governance]] within the trust.  Hospital board members have a duty to act on signals of poor performance on quality and safety data, and yet many of the papers presented to them have been found to be lacking good data visualisations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schmidtke|first1=Kelly Ann|last2=Poots|first2=Alan J|last3=Carpio|first3=Juan|last4=Vlaev|first4=Ivo|last5=Kandala|first5=Ngianga-Bakwin|last6=Lilford|first6=Richard J|title=Considering chance in quality and safety performance measures: an analysis of performance reports by boards in English NHS trusts|journal=BMJ Quality &amp; Safety|date=31 March 2016|pages=bmjqs-2015-004967|doi=10.1136/bmjqs-2015-004967|url=http://qualitysafety.bmj.com/content/early/2016/03/31/bmjqs-2015-004967.abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Future development==
In September 2015 [[Jeremy Hunt]] was reported as saying “I think we do have too many trusts as independent organisations" in a context where mergers between trusts and the establishment of chains of hospitals were being discussed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The NHS has 'too many trusts', says Hunt|url=http://www.hsj.co.uk/news/acute-care/the-nhs-has-too-many-trusts-says-hunt/5090168.article#.VilPbkpup1A|accessdate=22 October 2015|publisher=Health Service Journal|date=9 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Subsequently [[Simon Stevens (civil servant)|Simon Stevens]] made it clear that he did not expect the remaining NHS trusts to become Foundation Trusts, saying "We are frankly kidding ourselves if we think the non-FTs are going to pass the kinds of criteria that have been set by Monitor."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Stevens: Funding growth may depend on 'transformation' plans|url=http://www.hsj.co.uk/news/finance/stevens-funding-growth-may-depend-on-transformation-plans/5091115.article#.VilQy0pup1A|accessdate=22 October 2015|publisher=Health Service Journal|date=13 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==

There are several types of NHS trusts:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhs.uk/NHSEngland/thenhs/about/Pages/authoritiesandtrusts.aspx|title=NHS authorities and trusts|date=28 January 2013|work=The NHS in England|publisher=NHS Choices|accessdate=7 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

*[[NHS hospital trust]] (also known as an '''acute trust'''), which provides [[secondary care]] services
*[[NHS mental health trust]]
*[[NHS ambulance services trust]]
*[[Community Health NHS Trust]]

Over time the distinction between different types has eroded, and both hospital and mental health trusts have taken on responsibility for various community services.  [[Sustainability and transformation plan]]s all propose to move services out of hospitals into the community and the hospital trusts are generally planning to follow these initiatives.

===Foundation trusts=== 
{{Main|NHS foundation trust}}
Foundation trust status may be applied for by the above categories of NHS trust. Successive governments have announced that all NHS Trusts should become NHS Foundation Trusts, and deadlines have been set for this transformation, which have repeatedly been missed.{{cn|date=November 2013}}

===Former types===

*[[NHS primary care trust]] (PCT) (abolished 1 April 2013), which provided [[primary care]] services, public health functions and commissioned [[secondary care]] services
*[[NHS care trust]] (abolished 1 April 2013), provided/commissioned health and social care services, usually with responsibilities of both a PCT and a [[Local government in England|local authority]]

==Other types of NHS organisation==

===Special health authorities===

*[[NHS special health authority]], organised on a national basis, dealing with NHS-wide issues

The '''National Herbal Park''' ({{lang-my|အမျိုးသား ဆေးဖက်ဝင် အပင်များ ပန်းခြံ}}) is a {{convert|200|acre|km2|sing=on}} park located near the Naypyidaw-Taungnyo Road in [[Naypyidaw]], [[Burma|Myanmar]]. Over 20,000 herbal and [[Herbalism|medicinal plants]], representing over 700 species from the various [[Administrative divisions of Burma|states and divisions of Myanmar]], are grown in the park.  The herbal park is part of the government's efforts to protect and preserve the herbs from depletion and extinction and to keep alive the country's traditional system of medicines. It opened on 4 January 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aseancultureandinformation.org/coci/atn1.php?id=219 Myanmar National Herbal Park]&lt;/ref&gt; There is no entry fee.

==History==
In 1947 the hospital had 137 beds with an average occupancy of 122 patients. The Cubbon Wing, for chronically sick patients, financed by the estate of the late Thomas Cubbon, was added in 1951. A new Nurses' Home was built in 1953. At the end of 1955, there was a waiting list for admission of 279 patients.  Some patients had to be transferred to the White Hoe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gellion |first1=Donald |title=Birth of a Service |date=2008 |location=Isle of Man |url=http://www.isle-of-man.com/manxnotebook/fulltext/nhs2008/ch07.htm |accessdate=31 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==New location==
The hospital relocated in 2003 from its previous location at Westmoreland Road into a new building constructed on a [[greenfield land|greenfield site]] at the outskirts of the main town of [[Douglas, Isle of Man|Douglas]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hospitalmanagement.net/projects/nobles/ Nobles Hospital, Braddan] www.hospitalmanagement.net Retrieved 12 May 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

==Facilities==
There are 20 wards with 314 beds. Tertiary services are handled by [[NHS trust]]s in the North West of England. The pharmacy budget, which also covers Ramsey and District Cottage Hospital, Mental Health Services, Hospice Isle of Man, Community Nursing, Chiropody, Family Planning, Dental Clinics and the School Health Advisors is £2,500,000

It has been using the Medway patient administration system provided by [[System C]] since 2015. It has an electronic document management system with more than 100,000 records. The electronic record system extends to mental health, community, GP and social care services.  It is intended to remove paper records by the end of 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Isle of Man hospital aims to be paperless by 2018|url=https://www.digitalhealth.net/2016/09/isle-of-man-hospital-aims-to-be-paperless-by-2018/|accessdate=23 April 2017|publisher=Digital Health|date=28 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 the West Midlands Quality Review Service found that the critical care department was underperforming with a "culture of blame".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Isle of Man hospital 'not meeting standards'|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-isle-of-man-26937769|accessdate=23 April 2017|publisher=BBC News|date=9 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Physique 57 is a fitness studio, fitness DVD producer and distributor. Launched in 2006, Physique 57 owns and operates nine studios in New York City, the Hamptons, Los Angeles, Dubai and Bangkok.

Physique 57 co-founder Jennifer Vaughan Maanavi is a dance enthusiast, Columbia MBA and former Wall Street professional.  In 2005, upon the sudden closing of The Lotte Berk Method (a fitness studio that offered the eponymous technique created in the 1950s by a former ballet dancer) Jennifer realized that she and other Lotte Berk followers needed a new home. Teaming up with Tanya Becker, one of the foremost instructors of The Lotte Berk Method for over a decade, Physique 57 was born.{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}}

===Expansion===
In February 2006, Physique 57 began at 24 W. 57th Street in New York City, United States.

The Bridgehampton outpost opened in Lotte Berk’s former space at 264 Butter Lane Barn.  In the fall of 2007, the [[Spring Street (Manhattan)|Spring Street]] location in Soho’s historic Butterick building.

In June 2010, Physique 57 Beverly Hills launched its studio just steps from Rodeo Drive, and was honored as Best New Fitness Class by Los Angeles Magazine.

In August 2011, Physique 57 opened its third Manhattan, NY, studio on the Upper West Side, in the famous [[The Ansonia|Ansonia]].

In November 2012, Physique 57 raised the barre again by launching an online workout program, giving clients around the world the chance to benefit from their signature workouts – anywhere, anytime.

In the summer of 2013, Physique 57 opened its first international studio in Dubai.

In 2014, Physique 57 opened its second international studio in Bangkok.

In 2015, Physique 57 opened another international studio in Dubai.

In January 2016, Physique 57 opened its fourth Manhattan, NY, studio in the Financial District.

==DVDs==
In June 2009, Physique 57 launched its first DVD Workout Series. In December 2010, building on the success of the award winning{{which|date=October 2012}} and best-selling{{clarify|date=October 2012}} Volume 1 results, the Physique 57 DVD Workout Series Volume 2 was released.

==Partnerships==
In 2013, Physique 57 partnered with Fox Sports' [[Erin Andrews]] to bring a new online workout, Physique's Get Fit Quick featuring Erin Andrews, to their online workout program.

==The Physique 57 Solution book==
In January 2012, Co-Founders Tanya Becker and Jennifer Maanavi wrote their first book, ''The Physique 57 Solution: The Groundbreaking 2-Week Plan for a Lean, Beautiful Body''. This combination of a workout with an effective meal plan, created a two-week program from which readers quickly dropped pounds and lost up to 10 inches.{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8152">'''Polyunsaturated fatty acids''' ('''PUFAs''') are [[fatty acids]] that contain more than one [[double bond]] in their backbone.  This class includes many important compounds, such as [[essential fatty acid]]s and those that give [[drying oil]]s their characteristic property.

Polyunsaturated fatty acids can be classified in various groups by their chemical structure:
* [[methylene-interrupted polyene]]s
* [[conjugated fatty acids]]
* other PUFAs

== Types ==

=== Methylene-interrupted polyenes ===
These fatty acids have 2 or more ''[[Cis-trans isomerism|cis]]'' double bonds that are separated from each other by a single [[methylene bridge]] (-{{chem|CH|2}}-).  This form is also sometimes called a ''divinylmethane pattern''.&lt;ref name=baggott&gt;

[[File:Amino acids.png|thumb|220px|Amino acids are necessary nutrients. Present in every cell, they are also precursors to nucleic acids, co-enzymes, hormones, immune response, repair and other molecules essential for life.]] 
'''Proteins''' are essential nutrients for the [[human body]].&lt;ref name=proteinbody/&gt; They are one of the building blocks of body tissue and can also serve as a fuel source. As a fuel, proteins provide as much [[energy density]] as [[carbohydrate]]s: 4 [[Calories|kcal]] (17 [[Joule|kJ]]) per gram; in contrast, [[lipid]]s provide 9 kcal (37 kJ) per gram.  The most important aspect and defining characteristic of protein from a nutritional standpoint is its [[amino acid]] composition.&lt;ref name="DRIProteinChpt" /&gt;

[[Protein]]s are [[polymer]] chains made of [[amino acid]]s linked together by [[peptide bonds]]. During human [[digestion]], proteins are broken down in the stomach to smaller [[polypeptide|polypeptide chains]] via [[hydrochloric acid]] and [[protease]] actions. This is crucial for the [[absorption (small intestine)|absorption]] of the [[essential amino acid]]s that cannot be [[biosynthesis|biosynthesized]] by the body.&lt;ref name=genton&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Genton L, Melzer K, Pichard C | title = Energy and macronutrient requirements for physical fitness in exercising subjects | journal = Clinical Nutrition | volume = 29 | issue = 4 | pages = 413–23 | date = August 2010 | pmid = 20189694 | doi = 10.1016/j.clnu.2010.02.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are nine [[essential amino acids]] which humans must obtain from their diet in order to prevent [[protein-energy malnutrition]] and resulting death. They are [[phenylalanine]], [[valine]], [[threonine]], [[tryptophan]], [[methionine]], [[leucine]], [[isoleucine]], [[lysine]], and [[histidine]].&lt;ref name="DRIProteinChpt" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Young VR | title = Adult amino acid requirements: the case for a major revision in current recommendations | journal = The Journal of Nutrition | volume = 124 | issue = 8 Suppl | pages = 1517S-1523S | date = August 1994 | pmid = 8064412 | doi = 10.1093/jn/124.suppl_8.1517S | url = http://jn.nutrition.org/cgi/reprint/124/8_Suppl/1517S.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; There has been debate as to whether there are 8 or 9 essential amino acids.&lt;ref&gt;Rosane Oliveira, [http://ucdintegrativemedicine.com/2016/02/the-essentials-part-one/#gs.Sy6ae48 "The Essentials–Part One"], ''UC Davis Integrative Medicine'', Feb 4, 2016.

These five are [[alanine]], [[aspartic acid]], [[asparagine]], [[glutamic acid]] and [[serine]]. There are six conditionally essential amino acids whose synthesis can be limited under special pathophysiological conditions, such as prematurity in the infant or individuals in severe catabolic distress. These six are [[arginine]], [[cysteine]], [[glycine]], [[glutamine]], [[proline]] and [[tyrosine]].&lt;ref name="DRIProteinChpt" /&gt;

Dietary sources of protein include both animals and plants: meats, dairy products, fish and eggs, as well as [[grain]]s, [[legumes]] and [[nut (fruit)|nuts]]. [[Vegans]] can get enough essential amino acids by eating plant proteins.&lt;ref name=nih1&gt;{{cite web|title=Protein in diet|publisher=United States National Library of Medicine, National Institutes of Health|year=2009|url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002467.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Protein functions in human body==
Protein is a nutrient needed by the human body for growth and maintenance. Aside from water, proteins are the most abundant kind of molecules in the body. Protein can be found in all cells of the body and is the major structural component of all cells in the body, especially muscle. This also includes body organs, hair and skin. Proteins are also used in membranes, such as [[glycoprotein]]s. When broken down into amino acids, they are used as precursors to [[nucleic acid]], co-enzymes, hormones, immune response, cellular repair, and other molecules essential for life. Additionally, protein is needed to form blood cells.&lt;ref name=proteinbody&gt;{{cite journal | last = Hermann | first = Janice R. | title = Protein and the Body | journal = Oklahoma Cooperative Extension Service, Division of Agricultural Sciences and Natural Resources • Oklahoma State University | pages = T–3163–1 – T–3163–4 | url = http://pods.dasnr.okstate.edu/docushare/dsweb/Get/Document-2473/T-3163web.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DRIProteinChpt" /&gt;

Protein can be found in a wide range of food. The best combination of protein sources depends on the region of the world, access, cost, amino acid types and nutrition balance, as well as acquired tastes. Some foods are high in certain amino acids, but their digestibility and the [[anti-nutritional factor]]s present in these foods make them of limited value in human nutrition. Therefore, one must consider digestibility and secondary nutrition profile such as calories, cholesterol, vitamins and essential mineral density of the protein source.&lt;ref name=vernon&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Young VR, Pellett PL | title = Plant proteins in relation to human protein and amino acid nutrition | journal = The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition | volume = 59 | issue = 5 Suppl | pages = 1203S-1212S | date = May 1994 | pmid = 8172124 | doi = 10.1093/ajcn/59.5.1203s | url = http://www.ajcn.org/content/59/5/1203S.full.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; On a worldwide basis, plant protein foods contribute over 60 percent of the per capita supply of protein, on average. In North America, animal-derived foods contribute about 70 percent of protein sources.&lt;ref name=vernon&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Young VR, Pellett PL | title = Plant proteins in relation to human protein and amino acid nutrition | journal = The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition | volume = 59 | issue = 5 Suppl | pages = 1203S-1212S | date = May 1994 | pmid = 8172124 | doi = 10.1093/ajcn/59.5.1203s | url = http://www.ajcn.org/content/59/5/1203S.full.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meat, products from milk, eggs, [[Soybean|soy]], and fish are sources of [[complete protein]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Steinke | first = Waggle | name-list-format = vanc |title=New protein foods in human health: nutrition, prevention and therapy|publisher=CRC Press|year=1992|pages=91–100|isbn=978-0-8493-6904-9|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whole grains and cereals are another source of proteins. However, these tend to be limiting in the amino acid lysine or threonine, which are available in other vegetarian sources and meats. Examples of [[food staple]]s and [[cereal]] sources of protein, each with a concentration greater than 7.0%, are (in no particular order) buckwheat, oats, rye, millet, maize (corn), rice, wheat, sorghum, amaranth, and quinoa.

Vegetarian sources of proteins include legumes, nuts, seeds and fruits. [[Legume]]s, some of which are called [[Pulse (legume)|pulse]]s in certain parts of the world, have higher concentrations of amino acids and are more complete sources of protein than whole grains and cereals. Examples of vegetarian foods with protein concentrations greater than 7 percent include soybeans, lentils, kidney beans, white beans, mung beans, chickpeas, cowpeas, lima beans, pigeon peas, lupines, wing beans, almonds, Brazil nuts, cashews, pecans, walnuts, cotton seeds, pumpkin seeds, hemp seeds, sesame seeds, and sunflower seeds.&lt;ref name=vernon/&gt;

Food staples that are poor sources of protein include roots and tubers such as [[Yam (vegetable)|yams]], [[cassava]] and [[sweet potato]]. [[Plantain (cooking)|Plantain]]s, another major staple, are also a poor source of essential amino acids. Fruits, while rich in other essential nutrients, are another poor source of amino acids. The protein content in roots, tubers and fruits is between 0 and 2 percent. Food staples with low protein content must be complemented with foods with complete, quality protein content for a healthy life, particularly in children for proper development.&lt;ref name=proteinbody/&gt;&lt;ref name=fao85/&gt;&lt;ref name=latham/&gt;

A good source of protein is often a [[protein combining|combination]] of various foods, because different foods are rich in different amino acids. A good source of dietary protein meets two requirements:&lt;ref name=vernon/&gt;
*The requirement for the nutritionally indispensable amino acids (histidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, tryptophan, and valine) under all conditions and for conditionally indispensable amino acids (cystine, tyrosine, taurine, glycine, arginine, glutamine, proline) under specific physiological and pathological conditions
*The requirement for nonspecific nitrogen for the synthesis of the nutritionally dispensable amino acids (aspartic acid, asparagine, glutamic acid, alanine, serine) and other physiologically important nitrogen-containing compounds such as nucleic acids, creatine, and porphyrins.

Healthy people eating a balanced diet rarely need protein supplements.&lt;ref name=nih1/&gt;&lt;ref name=vernon/&gt;&lt;ref name=fao85&gt;{{cite book|title=Amino acid content of foods and biological data on proteins (FAO nutritional studies number 24)|publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization|year=1985|isbn=92-5-001102-4|url=http://www.fao.org/DOCREP/005/AC854T/AC854T00.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It also lists their respective performance as source of the commonly limiting amino acids, in milligrams of limiting amino acid per gram of total protein in the food source.&lt;ref name=fao85/&gt; The table reiterates the need for a balanced mix of foods to ensure adequate amino acid source.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

[[File:Protein shake.jpg|thumb|Protein milkshakes, made from protein powder (center) and milk (left), are a common [[bodybuilding supplement]].]]
[[Bodybuilding supplement#Protein Sources|Protein powders]] – such as [[casein]], [[whey]], [[Egg (food)|egg]], [[rice]] and [[soy]] – are processed and manufactured sources of protein.&lt;ref name=lemon/&gt; These protein powders may provide an additional source of protein for bodybuilders. The type of protein is important in terms of its influence on protein metabolic response and possibly on the muscle's exercise performance. The different physical and/or chemical properties within the various types of protein may affect the rate of protein digestion. As a result, the amino acid availability and the accumulation of tissue protein is altered because of the various protein metabolic responses.&lt;ref name=lemon/&gt;

==Testing in foods==
The classic [[assays]] for protein concentration in food are the [[Kjeldahl method]] and the [[Dumas method]]. These tests determine the total nitrogen in a sample. The only major component of most food which contains nitrogen is protein (fat, carbohydrate and dietary fiber do not contain nitrogen). If the amount of nitrogen is multiplied by a factor depending on the kinds of protein expected in the food the total protein can be determined. This value is known as the "''crude protein''" content. On food labels the protein is given by the nitrogen multiplied by 6.25, because the average nitrogen content of proteins is about 16%. The Kjeldahl test is typically used because it is the method the [[AOAC International]] has adopted and is therefore used by many food standards agencies around the world, though the Dumas method is also approved by some standards organizations.&lt;ref name="ProtAnaweb"&gt;{{cite web

Accidental [[contamination]] and intentional adulteration of protein meals with [[non-protein nitrogen]] sources that inflate crude protein content measurements have been known to occur in the [[food industry]] for decades. To ensure [[food quality]], purchasers of protein meals routinely conduct [[quality control]] tests designed to detect the most common non-protein nitrogen contaminants, such as [[urea]] and [[ammonium nitrate]].&lt;ref name=USAToday&gt;{{cite news

In at least one segment of the food industry, the dairy industry, some countries (at least the U.S., Australia, France and Hungary) have adopted "''true protein''" measurement, as opposed to crude protein measurement, as the standard for payment and testing: "True protein is a measure of only the proteins in milk, whereas crude protein is a measure of all sources of nitrogen and includes nonprotein nitrogen, such as urea, which has no food value to humans. ... Current milk-testing equipment measures peptide bonds, a direct measure of true protein."&lt;ref name="USDAweb"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://aipl.arsusda.gov/reference/trueprot.htm | vauthors = VanRaden PM, Powell RL | title = Genetic evaluations for true protein | publisher = [[United States Department of Agriculture]] | access-date = 27 April 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Measuring peptide bonds in grains has also been put into practice in several countries including Canada, the UK, Australia, Russia and Argentina where near-infrared reflectance (NIR) technology, a type of [[infrared spectroscopy]] is used.&lt;ref name=SciAmProt&gt;{{cite news

The testing method for protein in beef cattle feed has grown into a science over the post-war years. The standard text in the United States, ''Nutrient Requirements of Beef Cattle'', has been through eight editions over at least seventy years.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nap.edu/catalog/19014/nutrient-requirements-of-beef-cattle-eighth-revised-edition nap.edu: "Nutrient Requirements of Beef Cattle Eighth Revised Edition (2016)"]&lt;/ref&gt; The 1996 sixth edition substituted for the fifth edition's ''crude protein'' the concept of "''[[metabolizeable protein]]''", which was defined around the year 2000 as "the ''true protein'' absorbed by the intestine, supplied by microbial protein and undegraded intake protein".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.uaex.edu/publications/PDF/MP391.pdf uaex.edu: "Beef cattle nutrition series - Part 3: Nutrient Requirement Tables"], University of Arkansas Division of Agriculture publication MP391&lt;/ref&gt;

The limitations of the Kjeldahl method were at the heart of the [[Chinese protein adulteration#Protein testing|Chinese protein export contamination]] in 2007 and the [[2008 China milk scandal]] in which the industrial chemical [[melamine]] was [[2008 Chinese milk scandal#Melamine|added to the milk]] or glutens to increase the measured "protein".&lt;ref name="melamine"&gt;{{cite news|author=Stephen Chen |title=Melamine – an industry staple |pages=Page A2 |work=South China Morning Post |date=18 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Moore |first1=Jeffrey C. |last2=DeVries |first2=Jonathan W. |last3=Lipp |first3=Markus |last4=Griffiths |first4=James C. |last5=Abernethy |first5=Darrell R. | name-list-format = vanc |title=Total Protein Methods and Their Potential Utility to Reduce the Risk of Food Protein Adulteration |journal=Comprehensive Reviews in Food Science and Food Safety |date=17 August 2010 |volume=9 |issue=4 |pages=330–357 |doi=10.1111/j.1541-4337.2010.00114.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Protein quality===
{{see further|Protein quality|Amino acid score}}
The most important aspect and defining characteristic of protein from a nutritional standpoint is its [[amino acid]] composition.&lt;ref name="DRIProteinChpt" /&gt; There are multiple systems which rate proteins by their usefulness to an organism based on their relative percentage of amino acids and, in some systems, the digestibility of the protein source. They include [[biological value]], [[net protein utilization]], and [[PDCAAS]] (Protein Digestibility Corrected Amino Acids Score) which was developed by the FDA as a modification of the [[Protein efficiency ratio]] (PER) method. The PDCAAS rating was adopted by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations/[[World Health Organization]] (FAO/WHO) in 1993 as "the preferred 'best'" method to determine protein quality. These organizations have suggested that other methods for evaluating the quality of protein are inferior.&lt;ref name=FAO&gt;[http://www.fao.org/docrep/U5900t/u5900t07.htm Boutrif, E., Food Quality and Consumer Protection Group, Food Policy and Nutrition Division, FAO, Rome: "Recent Developments in Protein Quality Evaluation" ''Food, Nutrition and Agriculture'', Issue 2/3, 1991]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 FAO proposed changing to [[Digestible Indispensable Amino Acid Score]].

==Digestion==
Most proteins are decomposed to single amino acids by digestion in the gastro-intestinal tract.&lt;ref name="mehta"&gt;[http://pharmaxchange.info/press/2013/07/digestion-of-dietary-proteins-in-the-gastro-intestinal-tract-gi-tract/ Digestion of Dietary Proteins in the Gastro-Intestinal Tract]&lt;/ref&gt;

Digestion typically begins in the stomach when [[pepsinogen]] is converted to [[pepsin]] by the action of [[hydrochloric acid]], and continued by [[trypsin]] and [[chymotrypsin]] in the small intestine.&lt;ref name="mehta" /&gt;
Before the absorption in the [[small intestine]], most proteins are already reduced to single amino acid or peptides of several amino acids. Most peptides longer than four amino acids are not absorbed. Absorption into the [[enterocyte|intestinal absorptive cells]] is not the end. There, most of the peptides are broken into single amino acids.

Absorption of the amino acids and their [[Derivative (chemistry)|derivatives]] into which dietary protein is degraded is done by the [[gastrointestinal tract]]. The absorption rates of individual amino acids are highly dependent on the protein source; for example, the digestibilities of many amino acids in humans, the difference between [[soy]] and milk proteins&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gaudichon C, Bos C, Morens C, Petzke KJ, Mariotti F, Everwand J, Benamouzig R, Daré S, Tomé D, Metges CC | title = Ileal losses of nitrogen and amino acids in humans and their importance to the assessment of amino acid requirements | journal = Gastroenterology | volume = 123 | issue = 1 | pages = 50–9 | date = July 2002 | pmid = 12105833 | doi = 10.1053/gast.2002.34233 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and between individual milk proteins, [[beta-lactoglobulin]] and casein.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mahé S, Roos N, Benamouzig R, Davin L, Luengo C, Gagnon L, Gaussergès N, Rautureau J, Tomé D | title = Gastrojejunal kinetics and the digestion of [15N]beta-lactoglobulin and casein in humans: the influence of the nature and quantity of the protein | journal = The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition | volume = 63 | issue = 4 | pages = 546–52 | date = April 1996 | pmid = 8599318 | doi = 10.1093/ajcn/63.4.546 | url = http://www.ajcn.org/cgi/content/abstract/63/4/546 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For milk proteins, about 50% of the ingested protein is absorbed between the stomach and the [[jejunum]] and 90% is absorbed by the time the digested food reaches the [[ileum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mahé S, Marteau P, Huneau JF, Thuillier F, Tomé D | title = Intestinal nitrogen and electrolyte movements following fermented milk ingestion in man | journal = The British Journal of Nutrition | volume = 71 | issue = 2 | pages = 169–80 | date = February 1994 | pmid = 8142329 | doi = 10.1079/BJN19940124 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Biological value (BV) is a measure of the proportion of absorbed protein from a food which becomes incorporated into the proteins of the organism's body.

=== Newborn ===
[[Newborns]] of [[mammals]] are exceptional in protein digestion and [[assimilation (biology)|assimilation]] in that they can absorb intact proteins at the small intestine. This enables [[passive immunity]], i.e., transfer of immunoglobulins from the mother to the newborn, via milk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hurley WL, Theil PK | title = Perspectives on immunoglobulins in colostrum and milk | journal = Nutrients | volume = 3 | issue = 4 | pages = 442–74 | date = April 2011 | pmid = 22254105 | pmc = 3257684 | doi = 10.3390/nu3040442 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dietary requirements==
[[File:"Eat More Cottage Cheese...You'll Need Less Meat...A Postal Card Will Bring Recipes...Cottage Cheese or Meat^ Ask... - NARA - 512542.jpg|thumb|An education campaign launched by the United States Department of Agriculture about 100 years ago, on cottage cheese as a lower-cost protein substitute for meat.]]
Considerable debate has taken place regarding issues surrounding protein intake requirements.&lt;ref name="IJSNEM"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bilsborough S, Mann N | title = A review of issues of dietary protein intake in humans | journal = International Journal of Sport Nutrition and Exercise Metabolism | volume = 16 | issue = 2 | pages = 129–52 | date = April 2006 | pmid = 16779921 | doi = 10.1123/ijsnem.16.2.129 | url = http://journals.humankinetics.com/doi/abs/10.1123/ijsnem.16.2.129 | access-date = 6 December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=JACN&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lemon PW | title = Beyond the zone: protein needs of active individuals | journal = Journal of the American College of Nutrition | volume = 19 | issue = 5 Suppl | pages = 513S-521S | date = October 2000 | pmid = 11023001 | doi = 10.1080/07315724.2000.10718974 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The amount of protein required in a person's diet is determined in large part by overall energy intake, the body's need for nitrogen and essential amino acids, body weight and composition, rate of growth in the individual, physical activity level, the individual's energy and carbohydrate intake, and the presence of illness or injury.&lt;ref name=genton/&gt;&lt;ref name=lemon/&gt; Physical activity and exertion as well as enhanced muscular mass increase the need for protein.

If not enough energy is taken in through diet, as in the process of [[starvation]], the body will use protein from the muscle mass to meet its energy needs, leading to muscle wasting over time. If the individual does not consume adequate protein in nutrition, then muscle will also waste as more vital cellular processes (e.g., respiration enzymes, blood cells) recycle muscle protein for their own requirements.{{citation needed|reason=Unsubstantiated scientific claim.|date=March 2016}}

==Dietary recommendations==
According to US &amp; Canadian [[Dietary Reference Intake]] guidelines, women aged 19–70 need to consume 46&amp;nbsp;grams of protein per day while men aged 19–70 need to consume 56&amp;nbsp;grams of protein per day to minimize risk of deficiency. These Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) were calculated based on 0.8 grams protein per kilogram body weight and average body weights of 57&amp;nbsp;kg (126 pounds) and 70&amp;nbsp;kg (154 pounds), respectively.&lt;ref name="DRIProteinChpt"&gt;{{citation| title = Dietary Reference Intakes for Energy, Carbohydrate, Fiber, Fat, Fatty Acids, Cholesterol, Protein and Amino Acids| publisher = Institute of Medicine. National Academy Press| year = 2005| url = https://www.nap.edu/read/10490/chapter/12}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this recommendation is based on structural requirements but disregards use of protein for [[energy metabolism]].&lt;ref name=IJSNEM/&gt; This requirement is for a normal sedentary person.&lt;ref name=tarnopolsky&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tarnopolsky MA, Atkinson SA, MacDougall JD, Chesley A, Phillips S, Schwarcz HP | title = Evaluation of protein requirements for trained strength athletes | journal = Journal of Applied Physiology | volume = 73 | issue = 5 | pages = 1986–95 | date = November 1992 | pmid = 1474076 | doi = 10.1152/jappl.1992.73.5.1986 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, average protein consumption is higher than the RDA. According to results of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES 2013-2014), average protein consumption for women ages 20 and older was 69.8 grams and for men 98.3 grams/day.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| title = What We Eat in America, NHANES 2013-2014| publisher = U.S. Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service | year = 2016| url = https://www.ars.usda.gov/ARSUserFiles/80400530/pdf/1314/Table_1_NIN_GEN_13.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Active people===
Several studies have concluded that active people and athletes may require elevated protein intake (compared to 0.8 g/kg) due to increase in muscle mass and sweat losses, as well as need for body repair and energy source.&lt;ref name=IJSNEM/&gt;&lt;ref name=JACN/&gt;&lt;ref name=tarnopolsky/&gt; Suggested amounts vary between 1.6 g/kg and 1.8 g/kg,&lt;ref name=JACN/&gt; while a proposed ''maximum'' daily protein intake would be approximately 25% of energy requirements i.e. approximately 2 to 2.5 g/kg.&lt;ref name=IJSNEM/&gt; However, many questions still remain to be resolved.&lt;ref name=JACN/&gt;

In addition, some have suggested that athletes using [[Calorie restriction|restricted-calorie]] diets for weight loss should further increase their protein consumption, possibly to 1.8–2.0 g/kg, in order to avoid loss of lean muscle mass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Phillips SM, Van Loon LJ | title = Dietary protein for athletes: from requirements to optimum adaptation | journal = Journal of Sports Sciences | volume = 29 Suppl 1 | issue = sup1 | pages = S29-38 | date = 2011-01-01 | pmid = 22150425 | doi = 10.1080/02640414.2011.619204 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aerobic exercise protein needs===
Endurance athletes differ from strength-building athletes in that endurance athletes do not build as much muscle mass from training as strength-building athletes do.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} Research suggests that individuals performing endurance activity require more protein intake than sedentary individuals so that muscles broken down during endurance workouts can be repaired.&lt;ref name=phillips&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Phillips SM | title = Dietary protein for athletes: from requirements to metabolic advantage | journal = Applied Physiology, Nutrition, and Metabolism = Physiologie Appliquee, Nutrition Et Metabolisme | volume = 31 | issue = 6 | pages = 647–54 | date = December 2006 | pmid = 17213878 | doi = 10.1139/H06-035 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the protein requirement for athletes still remains controversial (for instance see Lamont, Nutrition Research Reviews, pages 142 - 149, 2012), research does show that endurance athletes can benefit from increasing protein intake because the type of exercise endurance athletes participate in still alters the protein metabolism pathway. The overall protein requirement increases because of amino acid oxidation in endurance-trained athletes.&lt;ref name=phillips/&gt; Endurance athletes who exercise over a long period (2–5 hours per training session) use protein as a source of 5–10% of their total energy expended. Therefore, a slight increase in protein intake may be beneficial to endurance athletes by replacing the protein lost in energy expenditure and protein lost in repairing muscles. One review concluded that endurance athletes may increase daily protein intake to a maximum of 1.2–1.4 g per kg body weight.&lt;ref name=lemon&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lemon PW | title = Do athletes need more dietary protein and amino acids? | journal = International Journal of Sport Nutrition | volume = 5 Suppl | pages = S39-61 | date = June 1995 | pmid = 7550257 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anaerobic exercise protein needs===
Research also indicates that individuals performing strength-training activity require more protein than sedentary individuals. Strength-training athletes may increase their daily protein intake to a maximum of 1.4–1.8 g per kg body weight to enhance muscle protein synthesis, or to make up for the loss of amino acid oxidation during exercise. Many athletes maintain a high-protein diet as part of their training. In fact, some athletes who specialize in anaerobic sports (e.g., weightlifting) believe a very high level of protein intake is necessary, and so consume high protein meals and also protein supplements.&lt;ref name=genton/&gt;&lt;ref name=lemon/&gt;&lt;ref name=phillips/&gt;&lt;ref name=IOC&gt;[https://hub.olympic.org/athlete365/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/1378_IOC_NutritionAthleteHandbook_1e.pdf Nutrition for Athletes, International Olympic Committee] Nutrition Working Group of the Medical and Scientific Commission of the International Olympic Committee, Revised and Updated in June 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Protein allergies====
{{Main|Food allergy}}
A food allergy is an abnormal [[immune system|immune response]] to proteins in food. The signs and symptoms may range from mild to severe. They may include [[pruritus|itchiness]], swelling of the tongue, vomiting, diarrhea, hives, trouble breathing, or low blood pressure. These symptoms typically occurs within minutes to one hour after exposure. When the symptoms are severe, it is known as [[anaphylaxis]]. The following eight foods are responsible for about 90% of allergic reactions: [[cow's milk]], [[egg as food|eggs]], [[wheat]], [[shellfish]], [[fish]], [[peanut]]s, [[tree nuts]] and [[soybean|soy]].&lt;ref name=NIH2012pdf&gt;{{cite web|author =National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases|title=Food Allergy An Overview|url=https://www.niaid.nih.gov/topics/foodAllergy/Documents/foodallergy.pdf|format=pdf|date=July 2012|deadurl=yes|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305145206/http://www.niaid.nih.gov/topics/foodallergy/documents/foodallergy.pdf|archive-date=2016-03-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Chronic kidney disease ====
While there is no conclusive evidence that a high protein diet can cause [[chronic kidney disease]], there is a consensus that people with this disease should decrease consumption of protein. According to one 2009 review, people with chronic kidney disease who reduce protein consumption have a 32% lower risk of death in comparison to affected people who do not make these dietary changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fouque D, Laville M | title = Low protein diets for chronic kidney disease in non diabetic adults | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | issue = 3 | pages = CD001892 | date = July 2009 | pmid = 19588328 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD001892.pub3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Update inline|reason=Updated version https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30284724|date = December 2018}}&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Schwingshackl L, Hoffmann G | title = Comparison of high vs. normal/low protein diets on renal function in subjects without chronic kidney disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis | journal = PLOS One | volume = 9 | issue = 5 | pages = e97656 | date = 2014 | pmid = 24852037 | pmc = 4031217 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0097656 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, people with this disease while using a low protein diet (0.6 g/kg/d - 0.8 g/kg/d) may develop [[Metabolism#Amino_acids_and_proteins|metabolic compensations]] that preserve kidney function, although in some people, [[malnutrition]] may occur.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

====Phenylketonuria====
Individuals with [[phenylketonuria]] (PKU) must keep their intake of phenylalanine - an essential amino acid - extremely low to prevent a mental disability and other metabolic complications. Phenylalanine is a component of the artificial sweetener aspartame, so people with PKU need to avoid low calorie beverages and foods with this ingredient.&lt;ref name=NIH2016&gt;{{cite web|title=phenylketonuria|url=https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/phenylketonuria|website=Genetics Home Reference|access-date=12 September 2016|date=September 8, 2016|deadurl=no|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160727233812/https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/phenylketonuria|archive-date=27 July 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Maple syrup urine disease====
[[Maple syrup urine disease]] is associated with genetic anomalies in the metabolism of [[branched-chain amino acids]] (BCAAs). They have high blood levels of BCAAs and must severely restrict their intake of BCAAs in order to prevent mental retardation and death. The amino acids in question are leucine, isoleucine and valine. The condition gets its name from the distinctive sweet odor of affected infants' urine. Children of [[Amish]], [[Mennonite]], and Ashkenazi Jewish descent have a high prevalence of this disease compared to other populations.&lt;ref name="DRIProteinChpt" /&gt;

==Excess consumption==
The U.S. and Canadian Dietary Reference Intake review for protein concluded that there was not sufficient evidence to establish a [[Tolerable upper intake level]], i.e., an upper limit for how much protein can be safely consumed.&lt;ref name="DRIProteinChpt" /&gt;

Dietary protein is converted by the digestive process to individual amino acids, which are then absorbed. When amino acids are in excess of needs, the liver takes up the amino acids and [[deamination|deaminates]] them, a process converting the nitrogen from the amino acids into [[ammonia]], further processed in the liver into urea via the [[urea cycle]]. Excretion of urea occurs via the kidneys. Other parts of the amino acid molecules can be converted into [[glucose]] and used for fuel.&lt;ref name=tarnopolsky/&gt;&lt;ref name=absorptionkinetics&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ten Have GA, Engelen MP, Luiking YC, Deutz NE | title = Absorption kinetics of amino acids, peptides, and intact proteins | journal = International Journal of Sport Nutrition and Exercise Metabolism | volume = 17 Suppl | pages = S23-36 | date = August 2007 | pmid = 18577772 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="isbn0-495-11657-2"&gt;{{cite book | first1 = Sareen S. | last1 = Gropper | first2 = Jack L. | last2 = Smith | first3 = James L. | last3 = Groff | name-list-format = vanc |title=Advanced nutrition and human metabolism |publisher=Wadsworth Cengage Learning |location=Belmont, CA |year=2009 |isbn=0-495-11657-2 |oclc= }}&lt;/ref&gt; When food protein intake is periodically high or low, the body tries to keep protein levels at an equilibrium by using the "labile protein reserve" to compensate for daily variations in protein intake. However, unlike body fat as a reserve for future caloric needs, there is no protein storage for future needs.&lt;ref name="DRIProteinChpt" /&gt;

Excessive protein intake may increase calcium excretion in urine, occurring to compensate for the pH imbalance from oxidation of sulfur amino acids. This may lead to a higher risk of kidney stone formation from calcium in the renal circulatory system.&lt;ref name="DRIProteinChpt" /&gt; One meta-analysis reported no [[adverse effect]]s of higher protein intakes on bone density.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Shams-White MM, Chung M, Du M, Fu Z, Insogna KL, Karlsen MC, LeBoff MS, Shapses SA, Sackey J, Wallace TC, Weaver CM | title = Dietary protein and bone health: a systematic review and meta-analysis from the National Osteoporosis Foundation | journal = The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition | volume = 105 | issue = 6 | pages = 1528–1543 | date = June 2017 | pmid = 28404575 | doi = 10.3945/ajcn.116.145110 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another meta-analysis reported a small decrease in systolic and diastolic blood pressure with diets higher in protein, with no differences between animal and plant protein.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rebholz CM, Friedman EE, Powers LJ, Arroyave WD, He J, Kelly TN | title = Dietary protein intake and blood pressure: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials | journal = American Journal of Epidemiology | volume = 176 Suppl 7 | issue =  | pages = S27-43 | date = October 2012 | pmid = 23035142 | doi = 10.1093/aje/kws245 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

High protein diets have been shown to lead to an additional 1.21&amp;nbsp;kg of weight loss over a period of 3 months versus a baseline protein diet in a meta-analysis.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Santesso N, Akl EA, Bianchi M, Mente A, Mustafa R, Heels-Ansdell D, Schünemann HJ | title = Effects of higher- versus lower-protein diets on health outcomes: a systematic review and meta-analysis | journal = European Journal of Clinical Nutrition | volume = 66 | issue = 7 | pages = 780–8 | date = July 2012 | pmid = 22510792 | pmc = 3392894 | doi = 10.1038/ejcn.2012.37 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Benefits of decreased [[body mass index]] as well as [[HDL cholesterol]] were more strongly observed in studies with only a slight increase in protein intake rather where high protein intake was classified as 45% of total energy intake.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Detrimental effects to cardiovascular activity were not observed in short-term diets of 6 months or less. There is little consensus on the potentially detrimental effects to healthy individuals of a long-term high protein diet, leading to caution advisories about using high protein intake as a form of [[weight loss]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Schwingshackl L, Hoffmann G | title = Comparison of high vs. normal/low protein diets on renal function in subjects without chronic kidney disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis | journal = PLOS One | volume = 9 | issue = 5 | pages = e97656 | date = 2014 | pmid = 24852037 | pmc = 4031217 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0097656 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ko GJ, Obi Y, Tortorici AR, Kalantar-Zadeh K | title = Dietary protein intake and chronic kidney disease | journal = Current Opinion in Clinical Nutrition and Metabolic Care | volume = 20 | issue = 1 | pages = 77–85 | date = January 2017 | pmid = 27801685 | doi = 10.1097/MCO.0000000000000342 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''2015–2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans'' (DGA) recommends that men and teenage boys increase their consumption of fruits, vegetables and other under-consumed foods, and that a means of accomplishing this would be to reduce overall intake of protein foods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://health.gov/dietaryguidelines/2015/guidelines/chapter-2/a-closer-look-at-current-intakes-and-recommended-shifts/|title=2015 – 2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans: Shifts Needed To Align With Healthy Eating Patterns: A Closer Look at Current Intakes and Recommended Shifts: Protein Foods|date=December 2015|publisher=U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and U.S. Department of Agriculture.|access-date=January 9, 2016|edition=8|quote=Some individuals, especially teen boys and adult men, also need to reduce overall intake of protein foods by decreasing intakes of meats, poultry, and eggs and increasing amounts of vegetables or other under-consumed food groups}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2015 - 2020 DGA report does not set a recommended limit for the intake of red and processed meat. While the report acknowledges research showing that lower intake of red and processed meat is correlated with reduced risk of [[cardiovascular diseases]] in adults, it also notes the value of nutrients provided from these meats. The recommendation is not to limit intake of meats or protein, but rather to monitor and keep within daily limits the sodium (&lt; 2300&amp;nbsp;mg), [[saturated fat]]s (less than 10% of total calories per day), and added sugars (less than 10% of total calories per day) that may be increased as a result of consumption of certain meats and proteins. While the 2015 DGA report does advise for a reduced level of consumption of red and processed meats, the 2015-2020 DGA key recommendations recommend that a variety of protein foods be consumed, including both vegetarian and non-vegetarian sources of protein.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Agata|first=Dabrowska,|date=2016-02-02|title=Dietary Guidelines for Americans: Frequently Asked Questions|url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc824573/?q=protein%20diet|journal=Digital Library|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Protein deficiency ==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3706">'''The Renal Support Network''' (RSN) is an American nonprofit, kidney patient-focused, kidney patient-run organization that works to benefit individuals affected by [[chronic kidney disease]] (CKD). RSN's mission is to help patients develop their personal coping skills, special talents, and employability by educating and empowering them (and their family members) to take control of the course and management of the disease.&lt;ref name="nephrologynursing.net"&gt;[http://nephrologynursing.net/current/dept/perspective/default.htm Patients Helping Patients: The Renal Support Network] Nephrology Nursing Journal, January 1, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

RSN works to achieve their mission through their national patient meeting and regional patient lifestyle meetings and the RSN Patients Educating Patients &amp; Professionals (PEPP) Patient Speakers Program. Information and education programs include the Kidney Times website and the KidneyTalk biweekly podcast. RSN sponsors Renal Teen Proms in Los Angeles and Washington DC.

A vital role of RSN is to provide lawmakers and policymakers with the patients’ perspective on the needs and capabilities of people with CKD. RSN does this through their Wellness &amp; Education Kidney Advocacy Network (weKAN).

== History ==
The Renal Support Network was founded in 1993 by [[Lori Hartwell]] to instill health, happiness, and hope into the lives of those affected by [[Chronic kidney disease|CKD]].

== Meetings ==
The national meeting is a three-day conference held in conjunction with the [[National Renal Administrators Association]] (NRAA) annual meeting. Regional Patient Lifestyle meetings are free to attend.

== Activities ==
The Wellness &amp; Education Kidney Advocacy Network (weKAN) consists of CKD patient activists from across the country whose common goal is to ensure that people with CKD receive quality care.&lt;ref&gt;[http://waysandmeans.house.gov/hearings.asp?formmode=view&amp;id=6323 Renal Support Network Statement to the House Ways &amp; Means Subcommittee on Health June 26, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

The PEPP Patient Speakers Program was initiated by RSN in 2005.  Since then, there have been over 100 speaking engagements to more than 9800 listeners.  These educational programs are led by [[chronic kidney disease|CKD]] patient-speakers who have been professionally trained, tested and certified to deliver these programs at meetings of renal patients and healthcare professionals. PEPP speakers are available at no charge to organizations that meet the RSN criteria.&lt;ref name="nephrologynursing.net"/&gt;

"Kidney Times"  is the organization's CKD information website; all articles are all written by people with CKD or health care professionals. A stipend is paid for articles published. "KidneyTalk" is a biweekly webcast hosted by [[Stephen Furst]] and [[Lori Hartwell]].

Renal Teen Proms are free events are for teens ages 14 to 24 who have [[chronic kidney disease]] and a guest of their choice.  Attendees are treated to dancing and limo rides, dinner and appetizers, glamor photos and a DJ.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.venturacountystar.com/news/2008/jan/28/a-dance-to-remember/ Ventura County Star] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080524220649/http://www.venturacountystar.com/news/2008/jan/28/a-dance-to-remember/ |date=2008-05-24 }} 2008 Renal Teen Prom coverage&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28980">[[File:Latin_America_(orthographic_projection).svg|thumb|Latin America is a predominantly Spanish
speaking and predominantly [[Roman Catholic]] region]]
While feminist movements became prevalent in Europe and North America in the 1960s and 1970s, the women of [[Latin America]] were gathering to oppose dictatorships and civil wars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fernandez Anderson|first=Cora|title=The Politics of Abortion in Latin America|url=http://rhrealitycheck.org/article/2013/07/17/the-politics-of-abortion-in-latin-america/|work=RH Reality Check}}&lt;/ref&gt; As democracy began to spread across the region, feminist movements gradually began to push for more reproductive rights.

In the 1990s, many of the groups that made up the women's movement began to evolve in order to adapt to a changing political climate. These groups focused on specific policy issues, such as [[abortion]], and were not composed exclusively of civil society actors. During this same time period, [[opposition to abortion|anti-abortion activism]] was also beginning to gain momentum. The [[Holy See|Vatican]] replaced hundreds of progressive clergy and summarily repressed discussions of reproductive issues. Groups continuing to fight for legal abortion across the region have faced a strong resistance from the [[Catholic church]] as well as the religious right in the [[United States]]. Although a majority of countries within the region are officially secular, the church continues to have an extensive influence within the region due to Latin America being the largest Catholic region in the world. The [[Christian right|religious right]] in the United States holds substantial clout over the political right in its own country, which has resulted in the United States banning federal funding for international NGOs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pothecary|first=Sam|title=Abortion Rights in Latin America: A Tale of Varying Woes|url=http://truth-out.org/opinion/item/19272-abortion-rights-in-latin-america-a-tale-of-varying-woes}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Considerably damaging to groups in Latin America was [[Ronald Reagan]]'s 1984 [[Mexico City Policy|Global Gag Rule]] which prohibited international organizations receiving US federal funds from performing or promoting [[abortion]] as a method of [[family planning]].

Latin America is home to some of the few countries of the world with a complete ban on abortion, without an exception for saving [[maternal mortality|maternal life]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-41005517&lt;/ref&gt;

== Defining reproductive rights ==
During the [[Cold War]], reproductive restrictions were directed at controlling [[overpopulation]] through technocratic regulatory mechanisms and vertical population control campaigns. The United Nations International Conference on Population and Development of 1994 held in Cairo, Egypt established the first global agenda for sexual and reproductive health and rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sexual and Reproductive Health|url=http://www.ghwatch.org/sites/www.ghwatch.org/files/B4.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The agreement marked a paradigm shift away from a narrow approach based on delivery of services and numbers rather than well-being. It placed rights at the center of population and development and defined reproductive health as "a state of complete, physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease of infirmity, in all matters relating to the reproductive system and to its functions and processes." This broader approach to reproductive health moved the Cairo Agenda into political and economic debates over access and rights to knowledge, resources, and appropriate services.

Thus, women and health movements in civil society and their allies in the United Nations and national bureaucracies have undertaken strong campaigns to link public health, gender equality, and development policy. By understanding reproductive rights in the broader context of human rights, governments are able to create a standard of health that ensures development.&lt;ref name=":66"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Raguz|first=Maria|date=2001|title=Adolescent Sexual and Reproductive Rights in Latin America|jstor=4065364|journal=Health and Human Rights|volume=5|pages=30–63|doi=10.2307/4065364}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, this broader understanding of reproductive health places a certain level of responsibility on the government in ensuring this aspect of health for its citizens.

This cross-cultural consensus focuses on the importance of one particular capability, that of bodily health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nussbaum|first=Martha|title=Promoting Women's Capabilities}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Recognizing the many areas reproductive health has influence over serves to exemplify its importance as well as gives some understanding as to what necessary improvements need to be made to a society.

Reproductive health also encompasses knowledge production and knowledge consumption. In order to obtain reproductive rights, quality information and services must be made available to all citizens of a society.&lt;ref name=":66"/&gt;

== Current strategies ==

=== International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) ===
The 1994 [[International Conference on Population and Development]] defined reproductive health as noted above. It also defined strategies and goals for advancing such reproductive health and rights in Latin America through what is called the [[Reproductive rights|Cairo Programme of Action]] (CPA). The CPA has three quantitative targets: (1) Reducing overall mortality, which implies an increase in life expectancy, reducing specific mortalities (2) Universal access to education, especially for girls (3) Universal access to [[reproductive health services]], including [[family planning]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Implementation of the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development in Latin America and the Caribbean: Review of the period 2009-2013 and lessons learned|url=http://www.eclac.cl/publicaciones/xml/2/50562/CRPDSummary.pdf|publisher=Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Adopted by the region at the conference, some improvements have been seen since the adoption of the CPA. Reproductive rights have become recognized in the constitutions of [[Bolivia]], [[Ecuador]] and [[Venezuela]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Richardson|first=Emma|author2=Anne-Emanuelle Birn |title=Sexual and Reproductive health and rights in Latin America: an analysis of trends, commitments and achievements|journal=Reproductive Health Matters|year=2011|pages=183–187}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Environmental Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean Ad Hoc Committee on Population and Development is responsible for official follow-up to the implementation of the CPA in [[Latin America]] as well as the [[Caribbean]].

=== Millennium Development Goals in Latin America ===
The [[Millennium Development Goals]] are a descriptive framework by which to monitor response to eight specific goals. They were announced in the [[Millennium Declaration]] in September 2000. Whether or not a country is on track to meeting these goals—in the case of Latin America—is tracked by the [[Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean]] (ECLAC). One particular goal in regard to reproductive health, Goal 5, seeks to improve maternal health within the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MDG Goals, targets and indicators|url=http://www.cepal.org/cgi-bin/getProd.asp?xml=/mdg/noticias/paginas/7/35557/P35557.xml&amp;xsl=/mdg/tpl/p18f-st.xsl&amp;base=/mdg/tpl-i/top-bottom.xsl|work=Millennium Development Goals in Latin America and the Caribbean|publisher=Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first target of Goal 5 is to reduce the [[maternal mortality]] ratio by three quarters between 1990 and 2015. In order to assess the progress towards this goal, ECLAC monitors maternal mortality ratios and the proportion of births attended by skilled health personnel. The second target of Goal 5 is to achieve universal access to reproductive health by 2015. This target is assessed by viewing contraceptive prevalence rates, adolescent birth rates, antenatal care coverage and percentages of unmet need for family planning. In order to achieve these goals, many actions have been taken, including the growing institutionalization of deliveries and the increased number of personnel trained to provide care during childbirth and emergency obstetric care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Maternal Mortality in Central America: The need to accelerate efforts by 2035|url=http://www.mhtf.org/tag/latin-america/|work=The Maternal Health Task Force|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140429080613/http://www.mhtf.org/tag/latin-america/|archivedate=2014-04-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Maternal health and mortality ==
According to the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2010, about 9,200 women are dying annually from pregnancy-related causes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kulczycki|first=Andrzej|title=Abortion in Latin America: Changes in Practice, Growing Conflict, and Recent Policy Developments|journal=Studies in Family Planning|date=21 September 2011|volume=42|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; These deaths have a variety of causes that can occur as a result of complications during and following pregnancy and childbirth. The World Health Organization estimates that around 80% of all maternal deaths are a result of severe bleeding, infections, high blood pressure during pregnancy and unsafe abortions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Maternal Mortality|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs348/en/|publisher=World Health Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a report by the Guttmacher Institute, more than 20% of women who gave birth in 2008 did not make the recommended four  antenatal visits and 13% did not deliver in a health facility.

None of the Latin American countries will reach the Millennium Development goal target specifically for maternal mortality, as well as it continues to be both a health and social challenge in Latin America. Research indicates that the numbers are disproportionately high within the [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous]] and afro-descendant populations among the very poor. For indigenous populations as well as adolescents and young people, the rate of unmet family planning need also remains high. Latin America has the second highest [[fertility rates]] among adolescents and the highest unsafe abortion rates in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Latin America and the Caribbean|url=http://icpdbeyond2014.org/pages/view/4-latin-america-and-the-caribbean|work=International Conference on Population and Development Beyond 201|publisher=International Conference on Population and Development Beyond 201}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Overall, the maternal mortality rate in Latin America is relatively low compared to other regions with a rate of 80 deaths per 100,000 live births. However, if one were to break down the region's mortality rate by country, one could easily demonstrate that there exists a large disparity between affluent and poor countries. For example, in Haiti the rate was closer to 350 deaths per 100,000 live births. The disparity between wealthy and poor areas likely exists due to the differences in access to services and skilled professionals. Women in the highest income quintile have far easier access to such health services than women in the lowest income quintile. The same class-based disparity exists when analyzing the use of contraceptive  methods.{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}

=== Adolescent maternity and reproductive health ===
Protecting the health of adolescents is an important public health priority. Increased investment in adolescent reproductive health contributes to improving the overall status of women as well as the reduction in poverty among families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Facts on the Sexual and Reproductive Health of Adolescent Women in the Developing World|url=http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/FB-Adolescents-SRH.pdf|work=Guttmacher Institute|publisher=International Planned Parenthood Federation}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adolescent health must be contextualized within reproductive health and thus public health. Latin American government as a whole did not recognize early pregnancy in adolescents to be an issue until 1984 during the International Conference on Population in Mexico City.&lt;ref name=":66"/&gt;

In Latin America, 38% of women become pregnant before the age of 20 and almost 20% of births are to teenage mothers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Maternal Health: A Priority to Ensure the Health and Rights of Women|url=http://www.ippfwhr.org/en/speech/maternal-health-priority-ensure-health-and-rights-women|publisher=International Planned Parenthood Federation}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each year there are estimated to be 1.2 million unintended pregnancies among adolescent women living in Latin America and the Caribbean. Although overall fertility rates have largely dropped within the region, adolescent maternity is following an opposite trend. The Gender Equality Observatory for Latin America and the Caribbean reports that as of 2011, in [[Nicaragua]] approximately 2 in 10 women between the ages of 15 and 19 is a mother. In places such as [[Chile]], [[Mexico]], [[Paraguay]] and [[Peru]] the percentage is close to 12% while in [[Belize]], [[Venezuela]], [[Colombia]], [[Guatemala]] and [[El Salvador]] reach percentages close to 15%. Inequality is also present in the issue of adolescent maternity, with pregnancy rates being three to five times higher among poor adolescents.{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}} While an overall universal trend towards earlier average age of menstruation can be seen, the mean age of marriage has declined. This implies that adolescents who are coerced into marriage are unprotected in terms of reproductive rights for longer periods of time.&lt;ref name=":66"/&gt;

According to the [[United Nations Population Fund|UN Population Fund]], education and access to information and services young people need in order to make responsible decisions remains insufficient. The importance of education is exemplified by how girls in Latin America who have completed only up to primary education or less have a higher probability of adolescent pregnancy.&lt;ref name=":66"/&gt; Further, many young girls are dying because their bodies cannot support pregnancies. The same fund reports that the risk of complications during pregnancy and delivery for girls aged 15 to 19 is double the rate for women in their 20s, and five times as high for girls under 15.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Edgerton|first=Anna|author2=Ina Sotirova |title=Sex and the Barrio: A Clash of Faith in Latin America|journal=World Policy Journal|issue=Winter 2011/2012 Faith Issue|url=http://www.worldpolicy.org/journal/winter2011/sex-and-the-barrio}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Research reveals that there are several major barriers that young people face to accessing [[contraception]], primarily with acquiring services. For example, facilities are frequently in areas inaccessible to young individuals. Due to a lack of information, adolescents often incorrectly use or do not use contraceptives at all.&lt;ref name=":66"/&gt; For the purpose of privacy from their communities and families, young persons often seek services from facilities not located directly in their own neighborhoods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Moya|first=Cecilia|title=Improving Youth's Access to Contraception in Latin America|url=http://www.advocatesforyouth.org/publications/517?task=view|work=Advocates for Youth|publisher=Advocates for Youth}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
There are also legal barriers preventing youth's access. Many policies limit or prohibit confidential services for youths.{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}

There is also a swath of data that is not collected by hospitals on abortions that are particularly "clandestine" / "backstreet". Studies have shown that in several Latin American countries, young single women are at a high risk for abortion which is not reflected by the amount of married, older women who were hospitalized for abortions.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Strickler|first=Jennifer, et al|date=2001|title=Clandestine Abortion in Latin America: A Clinic Profile|jstor=2673803|journal=International Family Planning Perspectives|volume=27|pages=34–36|doi=10.2307/2673803}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aside from a lack of information, young people who seek contraception are often denied by health workers acting out of their own moral convictions. It is clear that religious attitudes are very much present in society, which often deters young persons from seeking reproductive services and contraception.{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}

== Family Planning ==

=== Contraceptives ===

Use of modern contraceptives has increased to 62.5% (CITE: Population action) giving the region as a whole the highest contraceptive prevalence rate in the developing world. The increased uptake of sexual and reproductive health and family planning services has resulted in a marked drop in total [[fertility]] rates from approximately 4.6 children per woman in the 1970s to about 2.5 in 2013. 
In Latin America, multiple court decisions have granted personhood to fertilized eggs. These court decisions have been responsible for the extreme restrictions on access to emergency contraception within the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Access to EC in Latin America Takes Center Stage at the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights|url=http://reproductiverights.org/en/press-room/access-to-EC-in-Latin-America-at-IACHR|work=Center For Reproductive Rights}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The legal status of [[oral contraception]] in Latin America varies by country. In 2009 [[Honduras]] banned the free distribution and sale of emergency contraceptives That same year, the [[Constitutional Court of Peru]] ordered the [[Ministry of Health (Peru)|Health Ministry]] to refrain from distributing [[Emergency contraception|emergency contraceptives]] to the public sector. In [[Costa Rica]], where emergency contraceptives are not blatantly prohibited, the popular emergency contraceptive levonorgestrel is not registered as a product, which impedes access to the drug from within the public health system as well as the private market.  
Although the remaining countries in the region allow for the free distribution of emergency contraceptives, they do not have uniform regulations. In [[Chile]], [[Colombia]] and [[Ecuador]], the right to have access to emergency contraceptives is recognized. In [[Nicaragua]] and [[Bolivia]], the protocols of their respective health ministries are essentially law. In Argentina and Brazil, the distribution of emergency contraceptives is not legally recognized except in protocols and informative guides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hevia|first=Martin|title=The legal status of emergency contraception in Latin America|journal=International Journal of Gynecology and Obstetrics|year=2012|pages=87–90|url=http://www.ossyr.org.ar/pdf/bibliografia/190.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Abortion ===
{{See|Category:Abortion by country}}Abortion is a highly controversial aspect of reproductive rights. While every country in Latin America has differing laws and regulations regarding abortion, the general sentiment is that of disapproval. Abortions in Latin America have had a history of being unsafe and illegal (especially for poor women), with recent improvements in both of those areas.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kulczycki|first=A|date=2011|title=Abortion in Latin America: Changes in Practice, Growing Conflict, and Recent Policy Developments.|url=|journal=Studies in Family Planning|volume=42|pages=199–220|doi=10.1111/j.1728-4465.2011.00282.x|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of these improvements can be attributed to modern contraception, emergency care, as well as education. Similarly, advocacy and national conflict has grown surrounding abortion rights in Latin America. The region has seen a steady increase of feminist abortion activists, despite religion making the issue taboo.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Even when legislation has become more lenient (as has been the case recently with Mexico City and Chile), women often face institutional barriers to gaining access to abortions. When it comes to reporting data on abortions in Latin America, estimated abortion levels are often heterogeneous and highly variable due to legal frameworks and social stigmas.

According to the World Health Organization, in 2008, approximately "4.2 million abortions were conducted in Latin America and the Caribbean, almost three-fourths of them in South America. Virtually all these procedures were illegal and many were unsafe."&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

In 2011, the number of [[unsafe abortion]]s in Latin America rose to 4.2 million annually. Unsafe abortions account for a large proportion of [[maternal death]]s. For example, in [[Argentina]] [[unsafe abortions]] account for 31% of the maternal mortality rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Caivano|first=Joan|author2=Jane Marcus-Delgado|title=Time for Change: Reproductive rights in Latin America in the 21st Century|journal=Reproductive Laws for the 21st Century Papers|date=May 2012|url=http://centerwomenpolicy.org/programs/health/statepolicy/documents/REPRO_Time_for_Change.pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140307200146/http://www.centerwomenpolicy.org/programs/health/statepolicy/documents/REPRO_Time_for_Change.pdf|archivedate=2014-03-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Latin America abortion is:&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20160415084202/http://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/publications/pdf/policy/WorldAbortionPolicies2013/WorldAbortionPolicies2013_WallChart.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
*completely prohibited: El Salvador, Dominican Republic, Nicaragua 
*allowed only to save the mother's life: Guatemala, Honduras, Paraguay, Venezuela,
*allowed only to save the mother's life and in case of rape: Brazil 
*allowed only to save the mother's life or health: Costa Rica, Peru, Ecuador (and rape of [[disabled]] woman)
*allowed only to save the mother's life and in case of rape or fetal malformation: Chile (since 2017), Panama
*allowed only to save the mother's life or health, and in case of rape: Argentina, Bolivia
*allowed only to save the mother's life or health, and in case of rape, or fetal malformation: Colombia
*allowed on request: Cuba, Uruguay, Mexico City (in Mexico law varies by state)

Only two countries within Latin America allow for legal abortion without restriction. However, these countries are home to less than 5% of women between the ages of 15-44. According to a report released by the [[Guttmacher Institute]], 95% of abortions in Latin America are unsafe. Nearly one million women are hospitalized each year because of complications from unsafe abortion. Overall, Latin American rates of death related to illegal abortions rank among the highest in the world.

Strict abortion laws are accompanied by strict punishments. In El Salvador, for example, a woman can be jailed for up to 40 years for aborting while in Mexico, she could be jailed for up to 50 years. These punishments do not take into consideration the cause of the pregnancy, due to the fact that many of the imprisoned women were raped or had involuntary abortions&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.internationalhealthpolicies.org/the-right-to-health-and-safe-abortion-in-latin-america-still-a-long-way-to-go/|title=The right to health and safe abortion in Latin America: still a long way to go|date=2017-09-29|work=IHP|access-date=2018-04-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

International legislations also have an effect on abortion rights in Latin America. When U.S. President Donald Trump reinstated the Global Gag Rule on January 23, 2017, he prohibited all U.S. federal money from funding international organizations such as NGOs that "perform or actively promote abortion as a method of family planning".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://theglobalamericans.org/2017/03/global-gag-rule-womens-health-risk-latin-america/|title=The global gag rule: Women’s health at risk in Latin America?|work=Global Americans|access-date=2018-04-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the fact that abortion regulations are already extremely strict in Latin America, this legislation disproportionately affects Latin American organizations that try to provide abortion services to women either legally, or illegally.

=== Comprehensive Sexual Education ===

In 2012 a report presented to the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) found that access to information remains a significant roadblock to sexual and reproductive health, particularly in Latin America.(CITE HR BRIEF) The report noted that even when a state has a comprehensive legal framework guaranteeing access to information, in practice the individual's health is endangered by uninformed decisions made by individuals and policymakers based on inadequate information regarding sexual and reproductive health. In 2011, IACHR issued a report on access to information on reproductive health and found that the situation is compounded when women are poor, indigenous, of African descent, live in a rural area, or are a migrant.

In 2008, the region adopted "Miniseria Declaration, 'Prevention through Education,'" in response to a lack of comprehensive sexuality education. While there have been some setbacks and delays regarding implementation, there have also been key improvements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Five Sex Education Successes in Latin America|url=http://www.ippfwhr.org/en/blog/five-sex-education-successes-latin-america|work=International Planned Parenthood Federation}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, the ministries of health and education of Guatemala reaffirmed their commitment to working together in order to ensure the goals of the Ministerial Declaration are the met. In addition, the government of Guatemala is implementing a comprehensive sexuality education program for young people in nine regions of the country. Actions aimed at promoted comprehensive sexual education can be seen in multiple areas of the region, demonstrating that leaders are indeed dedicated to making such improvements. Earlier in 2012, Costa Rica adopted a national sexuality program for the first time in history. The curriculum approaches human sexuality in a comprehensive way; it includes lessons on human rights, gender equality, power, interpersonal communication, respect for diversity and pleasure. Also making a critical first step that year was El Salvador with its General Youth Act, legislation which recognizes and guarantees the right of young persons to receive comprehensive sex education. Implementation will be an ongoing challenge, however, recognition is important step toward meeting the needs of youth.

==Religion in Latin America==
{{See|Religion in Latin America|Catholic Church in Latin America}}
Religion in Latin America is characterized by the predominance of [[Roman Catholicism]], although there is also increasing [[Protestantism|Protestant]] influence (especially in Central America and Brazil) as well as by the presence of other world religions. Catholicism was introduced in Latin America with the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas]] and continued through the independence movements of the Spanish-American colonies up to the present day. Critics of the restrictive abortion laws of Latin America argue that this situation is created by the strong influence of  the Catholic church in the region.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/aug/27/abortion-rights-latin-america&lt;/ref&gt; [[Abortion in El Salvador|El Salvador]] and [[Abortion in Nicaragua|Nicaragua]] have drawn international attention for strong enforcement of their complete bans on abortion. In 2017, [[Abortion in Chile|Chile]] relaxed its total ban, allowing abortion to be performed when the woman's life is in danger, when a fetus is unviable, or in cases of rape.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/politics/chile-the-long-road-to-abortion-reform-a7917791.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== International Influence ==
While many of Latin America's reforms in regards to reproductive rights have happened internally, the broader international community plays an important role as well. The [[Center for Reproductive Rights]], for example, has used international litigation as a way to reinforce national legislation surrounding reproductive rights.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cabal, et al.|first=Louisa|date=2003|title=What Role Can International Litigation Play in the Promotion and Advancement of Reproductive Rights in Latin America?|jstor=4065417|journal=Health and Human Rights|volume=7|pages=50–88|doi=10.2307/4065417}}&lt;/ref&gt; Legal policy plays an important role in establishing a standard of reproductive rights internationally as well as within Latin America itself. This implies that over time, reproductive rights will be integrated into a broader framework of human rights.

'''Richard Luchsinger''' (1900–1993) was a [[Swiss]] [[physician|Doctor]] who made early contributions to the field of [[Speech and language pathology|Speech Language Pathology]], specifically in "[[phoniatry]]" or the study of [[voice]]. He was born in [[Switzerland]] and specialized in [[otorhinolaryngology]]. His most notable contribution to the field of voice was a textbook that he published with Dr. [[Gottfried E. Arnold]]. The textbook was originally published in [[German language|German]], however the second edition, published in 1965, was translated into English under the title: ''Voice-Speech-Language''.

Although the text was written over 40 years ago, the topics covered in the text are quite similar to those that would be covered in a contemporary voice textbook, which shows how much further along the study of [[phoniatry]] was compared to other subdivisions of [[Speech and language pathology|Speech Language Pathology]] at the time. For example, topics covered in this text included: [[speech]] [[acoustics]], [[observational methods]], treatment of [[laryngeal electromyography]], physiology of [[respiration (physiology)|respiration]] and voice production, [[genetics|genetic]] factors in voice, development of voice throughout the lifespan, professional voice, [[Speech therapy|voice therapy]]; pathology of the [[larynx]], [[Nodule (medicine)|nodules]], [[asymetries]], genetic defects of voice and [[laryngeal web]], [[sulcus glottides]], voice related [[endocrine]] problems, the effects of [[peripheral nerve lesions]], the [[sympathetic nervous system]]; [[laryngeal myopathy]], central lesions of the nervous system, [[laryngeal trauma]], [[cordectomy]], [[joint disorder]]s, [[alaryngeal voice]], [[vasomotor effect]]s on vocal fold function, [[functional dysphonias]], [[contact ulcer]]s, [[ventricular voice]], and [[psychogenic voice disorder]]s.

Luchsinger founded one of the first scholarly journals devoted to the study of voice, called the ''[[Folia Phoniatrica]]''. He also founded the ''[[Swiss Society for Phoniatrics, Logopedics, and Audiology]]''. Luchsinger published more than 120 research articles, ranging in topic from [[Cri Du Chat Syndrome]] to [[laryngeal surgery]]. He continued to be an active participant in the [[Speech and language pathology|Speech Language Pathology]] community until his death in 1993.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8575">'''Sleep induction''' is the deliberate effort to bring on [[sleep]] by various techniques or medicinal means, is practiced to lengthen periods of sleep, increase the effectiveness of sleep, and to reduce or prevent [[insomnia]].

==Darkness and quiet==
[[File:Sleep mask.jpg|thumb|[[Blindfold|Sleep mask]]]]Dim or dark surroundings with a peaceful, quiet sound level are conducive to sleep.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=The Practicing physician's approach to headache |author1=Seymour Diamond |author2=Donald J. Dalessio |page=53 |year=1992 |isbn=978-0-683-02506-4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f8BrAAAAMAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; Retiring to a bedroom, drawing the curtains to block out daylight and closing the door are common methods of achieving this. When this is not possible, such as on an airplane, other methods may be used, such as [[domino mask|masks]] and earplugs for sleeping which airlines commonly issue to passengers for this purpose.

==Activities==

===Guided imagery===
To relax and encourage sleep, a [[meditation]] in the form of [[guided imagery]] may be used. The stereotypical method is by [[counting sheep]], imagining [[sheep]] jumping over a fence, while counting them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Martin|first1=Paul|title=Counting sheep : the science and pleasures of sleep and dreams|date=Jul 2, 2013|publisher=St. Martin's Press|isbn=1466848146}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In most depictions of the activity, the person envisions an endless series of identical white sheep jumping over a fence, while counting the number that do so. The idea, presumably, is to induce boredom while occupying the mind with something simple, repetitive, and rhythmic, all of which are known to help humans sleep. It may also simulate [[REM sleep]], tiring people's eyes.

According to a BBC experiment conducted by researchers at [[Oxford University]], counting sheep is actually an inferior means of inducing sleep.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/cbbcnews/hi/sci_tech/newsid_1780000/1780803.stm |work=BBC News |title=Counting sheep keeps you up |date=2002-01-24 |accessdate=2010-05-12|postscript= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hot bath===
[[File:Clawfoot_bathtub.jpg|thumb|Tub]]The daily sleep/wake [[circadian rhythm|cycle]] is linked to the daily body temperature cycle. For this reason, a hot [[bathing|bath]] which raises the [[core body temperature]] has been found to improve the duration and quality of sleep. A 30-minute soak in a bath of {{convert|40|C|F|abbr=out}}&amp;nbsp;– which raises the core body temperature by one degree&amp;nbsp;– is suitable for this purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IZL_eUNZN8UC |chapter=ch 2. Sleep Promotion in Adults |author=Judith Floyd |title=Annual Review of Nursing Research |volume=17 |year=1999 |isbn=978-0-8261-8236-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sex===
Sex, and specifically [[orgasm]], may have an effect on the ability to fall asleep for some people.&lt;ref name="Saltz"&gt;{{Citation |url=http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/19696794/ |title=Jump in bed: Sex can help you stay healthy |last=Saltz |first=Gail |date=2007-07-11 |accessdate=2009-08-29 |quote=Having fun in bed is not only good for a relationship, but also good for you}}&lt;/ref&gt; The period after orgasm (known as a [[refractory period (sex)|refractory period]]) is often a time of increased relaxation, attributed to the release of the [[neurohormone]]s [[oxytocin]] and [[prolactin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|author=Exton MS |title=Coitus-induced orgasm stimulates prolactin secretion in healthy subjects |journal=Psychoneuroendocrinology |volume=26 |issue=3 |pages=287–94 |date=April 2001 |pmid=11166491 |doi=10.1016/S0306-4530(00)00053-6|name-list-format=vanc|author2= Krüger TH |author3= Koch M  |displayauthors=etal  |postscript= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Yawning===
Yawning is commonly associated with imminent sleep, but it seems to be a measure to maintain arousal when sleepy and so prevents sleep rather than inducing it.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.baillement.com/texte-baenninger-yawning.pdf |title=On Yawning and its functions |author=Ronald Baenninger |journal=Psychonomic Bulletin &amp; Review |year=1997 |volume=4 |pages=198–207 |doi=10.3758/bf03209394}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yawning may be a cue that the body is tired and ready for sleep, but deliberate attempts to yawn may have the opposite effect of sleep induction.

==Sleeping pills==
[[File:Tylenolss.jpg|thumb|Sleeping pills utilizing [[diphenhydramine]]]]{{Main|Hypnotic}}
Hypnotics, sometimes referred to as sleeping pills, may be prescribed by a physician, but their long-term efficacy is poor and they have numerous adverse effects including daytime drowsiness, accidents, memory disorders and withdrawal symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Sleep complaints: Whenever possible, avoid the use of sleeping pills. |journal=Prescrire Int. |year=2008 |volume=17 |issue=97 |pages=206–12 |pmid=19536941}}&lt;/ref&gt; If they are to be taken, the preferred choices are [[benzodiazepine]]s with short-lasting effects such as [[temazepam]] or the newer [[Z-medicine]]s such as [[zopiclone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Insomnia/Pages/Treatment.aspx |title=Sleeping tablets |publisher=NHS |accessdate=2014-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, in isolated cases sedatives such as [[barbiturates]] may be prescribed.

===Nonprescription medications===
A number of nonprescription medications have shown to be effective in promoting sleep. The amino acid [[tryptophan]] and its related compounds [[5-Hydroxytryptophan|5-HTP]] and [[melatonin]], have common use, with the prescription medication [[ramelteon]] operating on the same biochemical pathway.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|vauthors=Wurtman RJ, Hefti F, Melamed E | title = Precursor control of neurotransmitter synthesis | journal = Pharmacol. Rev. | volume = 32 | issue = 4 | pages = 315–35 | year = 1980 | pmid = 6115400 | doi = | issn = | url = http://wurtmanlab.mit.edu/publications/pdf/466.pdf | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927214709/http://wurtmanlab.mit.edu/publications/pdf/466.pdf | archivedate = 2007-09-27 | postscript =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The herb [[Valerian (herb)|valerian]] can also be effective in gently inducing a relaxed state which is conducive to sleep.

==Food and drink==
An [[Postprandial somnolence#Turkey and tryptophan|urban legend]] states that certain foods such as [[turkey meat|turkey]] and [[bananas]] are rich in [[tryptophan]] and thus assist sleep, although this has not been confirmed by research.

===Alcohol===
{{see also|Alcohol use and sleep}}
An alcoholic drink or [[nightcap (beverage)|nightcap]] is a long-standing [[folk remedy|folk method]] which will induce sleep, as alcohol is a [[sedative]]. However, when the alcohol blood level subsides, there is a rebound effect: the person becomes more alert and so tends to wake up too soon. Also, if they continue to sleep, [[REM sleep]] is promoted, and this may cause vivid [[nightmare]]s which can reduce the quality of the sleep.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MlvZGm16RMEC&amp;pg=PA210 |page=210 et seq. |year=1998 |title=The consequences of alcoholism |isbn=978-0-306-45747-0 |author=Marc Galanter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''spermatid''' is the [[haploid]] male [[gametid]] that results from division of secondary [[spermatocyte]]s.  As a result of [[meiosis]], each spermatid contains only half of the genetic material present in the original primary spermatocyte.  

Spermatids are connected by cytoplasmic material and have superfluous cytoplasmic material around their nuclei.

When formed, ''early round spermatids'' must undergo further maturational events to develop into [[spermatozoa]], a process termed [[spermiogenesis]] (also termed ''spermeteliosis''). 

The spermatids begin to grow a living thread, develop a thickened mid-piece where the [[mitochondria]] become localised, and form an [[acrosome]].  Spermatid DNA also undergoes packaging, becoming highly condensed.  The DNA is packaged firstly with specific nuclear basic proteins, which are subsequently replaced with [[protamines]] during spermatid elongation.  The resultant tightly packed [[chromatin]] is transcriptionally inactive.

In 2016 scientists at [[Nanjing Medical University]] claimed they had produced cells resembling mouse spermatids artificially from [[stem cells]].  They injected these spermatids into mouse eggs and produced pups.&lt;ref name="Nature"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cyranoski|first1=David|title=Researchers claim to have made artificial mouse sperm in a dish|journal=Nature|date=25 February 2016|doi=10.1038/nature.2016.19453|url=http://www.nature.com/news/researchers-claim-to-have-made-artificial-mouse-sperm-in-a-dish-1.19453|accessdate=4 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==DNA repair==

As postmeiotic [[germ cell]]s develop to mature [[sperm]] they progressively lose the ability to repair [[DNA damage (naturally occurring)|DNA damage]] that may then accumulate and be transmitted to the [[zygote]] and ultimately the embryo.&lt;ref name="pmid18282746"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Marchetti F, Wyrobek AJ |title=DNA repair decline during mouse spermiogenesis results in the accumulation of heritable DNA damage |journal=DNA Repair (Amst.) |volume=7 |issue=4 |pages=572–81 |year=2008 |pmid=18282746 |doi=10.1016/j.dnarep.2007.12.011 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In particular, the [[DNA repair|repair of DNA]] double-strand breaks by the [[non-homologous end joining]] pathway, although present in round spermatids, appears to be lost as they develop into elongated spermatids.&lt;ref name="pmid26694360"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ahmed EA, Scherthan H, de Rooij DG |title=DNA Double Strand Break Response and Limited Repair Capacity in Mouse Elongated Spermatids |journal=Int J Mol Sci |volume=16 |issue=12 |pages=29923–35 |year=2015 |pmid=26694360 |pmc=4691157 |doi=10.3390/ijms161226214 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A vestibulectomy is a gynecological surgical procedure that can be used to treat [[vulvodynia|vulvar pain]] and specifically in case of vulvadina and  vestibulodynia. Vulvadina is a chronic pain syndrome. It refers to the severe pain caused in the vulvar area and the causes are usually difficult to diagnose. The symptoms also include burning sensations and feelings of irritation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Vulvodynia|date=2018-07-24|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Vulvodynia&amp;oldid=851748332|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2018-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Buttocks and Inner thighs are also affected by Vulvadina. Vestibulodynia is similar to Vulvadina, except that the chronic pain and irritation is present in the vestibule, which is near the entrance of the vagina, while in case of Vulvadina, the pain is localised near the vulva.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://skinsupport.org.uk/conditions-details/vulvodynia-and-vestibulodynia|title=Vulvodynia and vestibulodynia {{!}} Skin Support|website=skinsupport.org.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vestibulectomy may be partial or complete.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.austinurogynecology.com/vulvar-vestibulitis/|title=Vulvar Vestibulitis - Austin Urogynecology|date=2015-02-10|work=Austin Urogynecology|access-date=2018-10-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vulvar vestibulectomy is also used to help people who suffer from provoked vestibulodynia, which causes sexual pain to people with vaginas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lavy|first=Yuval|last2=Lev-Sagie|first2=Ahinoam|last3=Hamani|first3=Yaron|last4=Zacut|first4=David|last5=Ben-Chetrit|first5=Avraham|date=2005-05-01|title=Modified vulvar vestibulectomy: simple and effective surgery for the treatment of vulvar vestibulitis|journal=European Journal of Obstetrics, Gynecology, and Reproductive Biology|volume=120|issue=1|pages=91–95|doi=10.1016/j.ejogrb.2004.04.039|issn=0301-2115|pmid=15866093}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

It is considered as an effective treatment for the long-run and has recorded high levels of satisfaction from the patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vulvalpainsociety.org/vps/index.php/research/published-research#Vestibulectomystudy|title=Published research - Vulval Pain Society|last=richcolour|website=Vulval Pain Society|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of the high successful rates, vestibulectomy is often only regarded as a last resort due to baseless cautions present in the society.

== Procedure ==
The surgery takes place below the urinary meatus, down to the border of the perineal area and includes the fourchette. [[Incisions]] are made on each side adjacent and parallel to the [[labia minora]]. The structures removed are the [[hymen]], [[mucous membrane]], [[Bartholin glands]] ducts and minor vestibular glands. In some surgeries, the amount of tissue removed is not so extensive. [[Vaginal mucosa]] tissue remains attached and then is pulled downward to cover the area where tissue was removed. This surgery is also used to treat [[lichen sclerosus]].{{sfn|Hoffman|page=1070}} "The complete surgery removes the entire lateral hymenal tissues to the lateral vestibular walls at Hart’s line, and involves removal of the entire posterior fourchette from the posterior hymenal remnants down to the perineum" which barring complications, enables the entire procedure to be over within an hour. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sandiegosexualmedicine.com/female-treatments/vestibulectomy|title=Vestibulectomy {{!}} San Diego Sexual Medicine|website=www.sandiegosexualmedicine.com|access-date=2018-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The procedure involves minimal bleeding and is usually done using local anesthesia. The amount of tissue removed during the surgery can vary with respect to the pain.

== Complications ==
Complications related to vestibulectomy include bleeding, infection. Long-term complications can be weakness of the anal muscles, cosmetic changes, development of a Bartholin's cyst, a decline in vaginal lubrication. Reports of satisfaction with the outcome of the surgical procedure can be as high as 90%.{{sfn|Unger|page=S45}}

The procedure has has been known to be unsuccessful in rare cases, where the pain remained constant even after surgery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vulvalpainsociety.org/vps/index.php/treatments/surgery-for-vulval-pain|title=Surgery for vulval pain - Vulval Pain Society|website=Vulval Pain Society|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In such cases, alternative treatments like oral medicines or more surgeries may be considered, depending on the severity of the persisting pain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://images.biomedsearch.com/21811531/jocmr-03-59.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAIBOKHYOLP4MBMRGQ&amp;Expires=1540771200&amp;Signature=gITKW8XlZbbw13u%2FrTSznlokG%2FA%3D|title=|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Recovery ==
The recovery period is about 6-12 weeks, depending on the amount of vulvar tissues removed. Post-surgery, the patient might need further physical and possible mental therapy to avoid scarring and lead a regular sexual life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vulvalpainsociety.org/vps/index.php/treatments/surgery-for-vulval-pain|title=Surgery for vulval pain - Vulval Pain Society|website=Vulval Pain Society|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Epidemiology ==
In a [https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1743-6109.2006.00303.x study] done in 2006, it was discovered that 93% of patients who had undergone the surgery recommended it for vulvar pain. Only 11% of women continued to have issues in their sex lives post-surgery.

'''William Dameshek''' (1900, [[Voronezh]] – 1969) was an [[United States|American]] [[hematology|hematologist]]. Trained at [[Harvard]], he was the founder of ''[[Blood (journal)|Blood]]'', the prime core clinical journal of hematology, in 1946. He is also credited with describing the concept of [[myeloproliferative disease]]s in 1951. In addition, he participated in the first studies of [[nitrogen mustard]] in various [[hematological malignancy|hematological malignancies]], widely considered the first uses of [[chemotherapy]] in malignant diseases. Dr Dameshek was also the first one who described [[chronic lymphocytic leukemia]] (CLL), a common form of leukemia in adults.

Dr. Dameshek served as president of the [[American Society of Hematology]] (ASH) in 1964.  He made numerous contributions to ASH as well as the field of hematology and was the first editor of its journal ''[[Blood (journal)|Blood]]''. Given Dr. Dameshek's accomplishments, ASH has named the Dameshek Prize in his honor. Each year the Dameshek Prize is awarded to individual who has made an outstanding contribution in hematology.
