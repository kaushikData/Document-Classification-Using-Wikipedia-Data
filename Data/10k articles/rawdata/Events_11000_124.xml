The '''1916 Summer Olympics''' (German: ''Olympische Sommerspiele 1916''), officially known as the '''Games of the VI Olympiad''', were scheduled to be held in [[Berlin]], [[Germany]], but were eventually cancelled due to the outbreak of [[World War I]]. Berlin was selected as the host city during the 14th IOC Session in [[Stockholm]] on 4 July 1912,&lt;ref&gt;Bill Mallon and Jeroen Heijmans, Historical Dictionary of the Olympic Movement (Scarecrow Press, 2011) xiv&lt;/ref&gt; defeating bids from [[Alexandria]], [[Amsterdam]], [[Brussels]], [[Budapest]] and [[Cleveland]].&lt;ref name=votes&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesbids.com/english/archives/past.shtml |title=Past Olympic host city election results |publisher=[[GamesBids]] |accessdate=17 March 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5xFvf0ufx?url=http://www.gamesbids.com/eng/past.html |archivedate=17 March 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; After the 1916 Games were cancelled, Berlin would eventually host the [[1936 Summer Olympics]], twenty years later.

==History==
Work on the stadium, the [[Deutsches Stadion (Berlin)|Deutsches Stadion]] ("German Stadium"), began in 1912 at what was the [[Grunewald Race Course]]. It was planned to seat more than 18,000 spectators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Berlin Stadium Is Begun.

At the outbreak of World War I in 1914, organization continued as no one expected that the war would continue for several years. Eventually, though, the Games were cancelled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Pelle, Kimberly D. |author2=Findling, John E. |title=Historical dictionary of the modern Olympic movement |edition= |publisher=Greenwood Press |location=Westport, Conn |year=1996 |origyear= |pages= 47–53|quote= |isbn=0-313-28477-6 |oclc= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=InQ_9QaRTlMC&amp;pg=PA52&amp;dq=1916+Summer+Olympics+berlin&amp;ei=Xgu_SJqJDpKQzQTyyqGKDg&amp;sig=ACfU3U0zyPFfvQ-DHSQKUD46oNB3ygeznQ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A winter sports week with [[speed skating]], [[figure skating]], [[ice hockey]] and [[Nordic skiing]] was planned; the concept of this week eventually gave rise to the [[1924 Winter Olympics|first]] [[Winter Olympic Games]]. The central venue was to have been the Deutsches Stadion.

Berlin returned to Olympic bidding in 1931, when it beat [[Barcelona]], [[Second Spanish Republic|Spain]], for the right to host the [[1936 Summer Olympics]], the last Olympics before the outbreak of [[World War II]].&lt;ref name="isbn0-252-07046-1"&gt;{{cite book |author=Guttmann, Allen |title=The Olympics, a history of the modern games |edition= |publisher=University of Illinois Press |location=Urbana |year=2002 |origyear= |pages= 53|quote= |isbn=0-252-07046-1 |oclc= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TbLmQQG-2bQC&amp;pg=PA53&amp;vq=1931&amp;dq=1931+Summer+Olympics+berlin+barcelona&amp;source=gbs_search_s&amp;sig=ACfU3U2E0IXGK2lc0RdxUps0oscnR1fJsA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''1968 London–Sydney Marathon''', officially '''Daily Express-Daily Telegraph London-Sydney Marathon''' was the first running of the [[London-Sydney Marathon]]. The rally took place between the 24th of November and the 17th of December 1968. The event covered 9,900 miles (16,000&amp;nbsp;km) through [[Europe]], [[Asia]] and [[Australia]]. It was won by [[Andrew Cowan]], Colin Malkin and Brian Coyle, driving a [[Rootes Arrow|Hillman Hunter]].

==Background==
The original Marathon was the result of a lunch in late 1967, during a period of despondency in Britain caused by the [[devaluation]] of the [[Pound sterling|pound]].&lt;ref name="began"&gt;[http://marathon68.homestead.com/Page3.html "How It All Began"], transcript of contemporary ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'' report, marathon68.homestead.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="marsh"&gt;[http://www.citroen.mb.ca/cItROeNeT/sport/london-sydney-marathon-68.html "The great adventure of the decade"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061207051259/http://www.citroen.mb.ca/cItROeNeT/sport/london-sydney-marathon-68.html |date=7 December 2006 }}, Julian Marsh, Citroënët, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sir Max Aitken, 2nd Baronet|Sir Max Aitken]], proprietor of the ''[[Daily Express]]'', and two of his editorial executives, Jocelyn Stevens and [[Tommy Sopwith (racing driver)|Tommy Sopwith]], decided to create an event which their newspaper could sponsor, and which would serve to raise the country's spirits. Such an event would, it was felt, act as a showcase for British engineering and would boost export sales in the countries through which it passed.

The initial UK£10,000 winner's prize offered by the ''Daily Express'' was soon joined by a £3,000 runners-up award and two £2,000 prizes for the third-placed team and for the highest-placed Australians, all of which were underwritten by the ''[[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|Daily Telegraph]]'' newspaper and its proprietor [[Sir Frank Packer]], who was eager to promote the Antipodean leg of the rally.&lt;ref name="began"/&gt;

==The route==
An eight-man organising committee was established to create a suitably challenging but navigable route. [[Jack Sears]], organising secretary and himself a former racing driver, plotted a 7,000-mile course covering eleven countries in as many days, and arranged that the [[Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company|P&amp;O]] liner ''S.S. Chusan'' would ferry the first 72 cars and their crews on the nine-day voyage from India, before the final 2,900 miles across Australia:&lt;ref name="timetable"&gt;[http://marathon68.homestead.com/Page15.html "Timetable of the Marathon"], marathon68.homestead.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="route"&gt;[http://marathon68.homestead.com/Page6.html "The Route"], Alan Sawyer, marathon68.homestead.com&lt;/ref&gt;

'''99ers''' is a colloquial term for unemployed people in the United States, mostly citizens, who have exhausted all of their [[unemployment benefits]], including all [[unemployment extension]]s.  As a result of the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act]] passed by [[United States Congress|Congress]] in February 2009, many unemployed people could receive up to 99 weeks of unemployment insurance benefits, hence the name "99ers".&lt;ref name="99ers1"&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/07/12/AR2010071205144.html | work=The Washington Post | first=Michael A. | last=Fletcher | title=No unemployment extension: Benefits not in sight for the long-term jobless | date=July 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="99ers2"&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/37404685/ns/business-economy_at_a_crossroads MSNBC News], MSNBC Article on "99ers"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="99ers3"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://articles.latimes.com/2010/apr/30/business/la-fi-0430-99ers-20100430 | work=Los Angeles Times | first=Alana | last=Semuels | title='99Ers' Exhaust Jobless Benefits | date=April 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="99ers4"&gt;[http://www.aolnews.com/article/2010-unemployment-extension-faq-tier-5-99ers-explained-and-de/19555874 AOL News] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100817165752/http://www.aolnews.com/article/2010-unemployment-extension-faq-tier-5-99ers-explained-and-de/19555874 |date=August 17, 2010 }}, AOL News Article on "99ers"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="99ers5"&gt;[http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/video/99ers-left-benefits-extension-11203881 ABC News], ABC News Video on "99ers"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="99ers6"&gt;[http://www.epi.org/publications/entry/for_four_out_of_five_unemployed_workers_there_are_no_jobs/ Economics Policy Institute], EPI article on "99ers"&lt;/ref&gt; An estimated 7 million people are affected.&lt;ref name="99ers7"&gt;[http://globaleconomicanalysis.blogspot.com/2010/09/question-of-day-how-many-people-have.html], Mike Shedlock's blog, describing estimation methodology&lt;/ref&gt;

==Unemployment benefits==

United States unemployment benefits during the [[financial crisis of 2007-2010]] were calculated as follows (with the availability of extensions dependent on a state's unemployment rate (see: [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]]):

==Legislation==

Legislation to extend unemployment benefits had been blocked from coming to a vote on the floor of the Senate through minority Republican [[filibuster]] or holds.  This began in February 2010 with the block of an unemployment benefit funding bill vote for already authorized and granted unemployment checks for those who had not exhausted their benefits by a single Senator, [[Jim Bunning]] (R-KY).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0210/33566.html Politico], Sen. Jim Bunning holds floor, Politico (February 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

Following that [[precedent]], Senate floor votes on unemployment have required a [[supermajority]] of sixty votes to bring the bills to the floor.  Bunning's position was that he wanted the bill paid for out of previously allocated funds from the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009]]. Senators who did not initially support Bunning's position since used this argument to block or delay votes on unemployment extensions that could not achieve a supermajority to reach the floor for a vote.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/economy-a-budget/111057-unemployment-extension-should-have-been-paid-for-sen-mike-johanns The Hill], Unemployment extension should have been paid for (Sen. Mike Johanns) The Hill&lt;/ref&gt;

Economists have cited that unemployment should not have the requirement of being paid for out of an existing stimulus package because it is stimulative and, therefore, to take away allocated funds from other projects would have a self-canceling effect.&lt;ref name='cbpp'&gt;[http://www.cbpp.org/cms/?fa=view&amp;id=863 Center on Budget and Policy Priorities ], The Four Pieces of Effective Fiscal Stimulus  Unemployment Insurance, State Relief, Food Stamps, and Tax Refunds, Center on Budget and Policy Priorities&lt;/ref&gt;

The passage of the bill to fund eligible (non-exhausted) unemployment benefits required a special appointment of a replacement senator, [[Carte Goodwin]], by [[West Virginia]] Governor [[Joe Manchin]], after the death of Senator [[Robert Byrd]] (D-WV), whose vote was needed for the supermajority.  This gave the Senate its 60th vote for the legislation and the funds were released to the states to pay unemployment compensation to those who were eligible and who had not yet exhausted benefits as of July 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100726004940/http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20100722/ap_on_bi_ge/us_unemployment_benefits Associated Press], Checks are coming: Obama signs unemployment bill, AP (22 July 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

The passage of the bill did not provide for those who exhausted their benefits, the 99ers.

On August 4, 2010, [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Debbie Stabenow]] (D-MI) introduced a bill (S.3706) to extend unemployment past 99 weeks.  The bill was referred to the [[Senate Finance Committee]] prior to the Senate breaking for their summer vacation:

===The Americans Want to Work Act (S.3706)===

A Senate bill introduced by Senator Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) on August 4, 2010 will, if passed, benefit those who have exhausted all of their benefits by providing an additional 20 weeks of unemployment benefits under a Tier 5. The bill has an unemployment rate threshold of 7.5% which requires states to have an unemployment rate at 7.5% or higher to qualify.  The bill was announced by Senator Stabenow on [[MSNBC]]'s ''The [[Ed Schultz]] Show'' [http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/21134540/vp/38584698#38565782 (video)].&lt;ref name="ed"&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/21134540/vp/38584698#38565782 The Ed Shultz Show], MSNBC News, Senator Stabenow Announces 99er Bill&lt;/ref&gt;  The bill is co-sponsored by Senators [[Charles Schumer]] (D-NY), [[Harry Reid]] (D-NV), [[Dick Durbin]] (D-IL), [[Carl Levin]] (D-MI), [[Bob Casey, Jr.]] (D-PA), [[Christopher Dodd]] (D-CT), [[Sherrod Brown]] (D-OH), [[Jack Reed (politician)|Jack Reed]] (D-RI), and [[Sheldon Whitehouse]] (D-RI).&lt;ref name="S.3706 Senator Stabenow Official Press Release"&gt;[http://stabenow.senate.gov/press/2010/080410Americanswanttoworkact.htm S.3706 Senator Stabenow Press Release] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100819062613/http://stabenow.senate.gov/press/2010/080410Americanswanttoworkact.htm |date=August 19, 2010 }}, S.3706 Senator Stabenow Press Release&lt;/ref&gt;

The proposed bill was designed to help 99ers by:
* Creating an additional tier of benefits for those who have exhausted their unemployment insurance.
* Extends the HIRE Act payroll tax exemption through the end of 2011.
* Doubles the general business tax credit to encourage businesses to hire the hardest hit Americans.

Tier 5 Unemployment Insurance (Under S.3706 Bill):  What it does: Provides 20 weeks of additional unemployment insurance for states with 7.5% or higher unemployment. This tier will benefit the people who have exhausted all of their benefits.

Retroactive Eligibility: Would apply retroactively to everyone who has exhausted all of their previous tiers in recent months. However, benefits would not be paid retroactively. (Example: a claimant who exhausted his or her benefits three months ago would be eligible to begin Tier 5 at the date of enactment. He or she would not, however, be paid out for the three months in which no benefits were received. If a claimant is going to exhaust benefits in two weeks, he or she will move right onto Tier 5 and receive 20 weeks of benefits.)

Requirements: People who are unemployed still need to meet current UI law requirements such as job searches.

On August 10, 2010, Representative [[Shelley Berkley]] (D-NV) introduced a House bill (H.R. 6901) to extend benefits for another 20 additional weeks for states whose unemployment rate exceeds 10 percent:

===The Emergency Unemployment Compensation Act (H.R. 6091)===
A House bill introduced by Representative [[Shelley Berkley]] (D-NV-1) on August 10, 2010 will, if passed, benefit those who have exhausted all of their benefits by providing an additional 20 weeks of unemployment benefits under a Tier 5.  The bill has an unemployment rate threshold of 10% which requires states to have an unemployment rate at 10% or higher to qualify. The bill is co-sponsored by Representatives [[Michael F. Doyle]] (D, PA-14), [[Bob Filner]] (D, CA-51), [[Barney Frank]] (D, MA-4), [[Phil Hare]] (D, IL-17), [[Dale Kildee]] (D, MI-5), [[Carolyn Kilpatrick]] (D, MI-13), [[John Lewis (Georgia politician)|John Lewis]] (D, GA-5), [[Jim McDermott]] (D, WA-7), [[Laura Richardson]] (D, CA-37), [[Linda Sánchez]] (D, CA-39), [[Janice Schakowsky]] (D, IL-9) and [[Diane Watson]] (D, CA-33).&lt;ref name="H.R. 6091 Open Congress"&gt;[http://berkley.house.gov/2010/08/new-berkley-bill-extends-unemployment-help-to-nevadans-who-have-exhausted-benefits.shtml Berkley.House.Gov] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101007050130/http://berkley.house.gov/2010/08/new-berkley-bill-extends-unemployment-help-to-nevadans-who-have-exhausted-benefits.shtml |date=October 7, 2010 }}, Shelly Berkley (H.R. 6091) Press Release&lt;/ref&gt;

News reports and interviews have been presented by various media outlets that include ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[The Washington Post]]'' and [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]]'s ''NewsHour''.  The 99er cause has been championed by [[Ed Schultz]] on his MSNBC television show, where he lashed out at Congress, and hosted the announcement of Senator Stabenow's 99er bill on his MSNBC television show [http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/21134540/vp/38584698#38565782 (video)]&lt;ref name="ed"/&gt; and his radio program&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bigeddieradio.com/videoblog/details.asp?BID=353 The Ed Schultz Radio Show] The Ed Schultz Radio Show's Stabenow Announcement on 99ers, August 4, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; and by [[Rachel Maddow]] on her television program where she replayed [[99ers#Controversy|negative statements]] about the unemployed by [[Sharron Angle]], Senator [[Jon Kyl]] (R-AZ), Rep. [[Steve King]], (R-IA), Rep. [[Dean Heller]] (R-NV), Lt. Gov. [[Andre Bauer]] (R-SC). Examiner

Both ''The New York Times'' and [[PBS NewsHour]] have covered the story.&lt;ref name="99ers10"&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/03/us/03unemployed.html | work=The New York Times | first=Michael | last=Luo | title=Desperation Grows as Jobless Benefits Run Out | date=August 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="99ers11"&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/business/july-dec10/99ers_08-06.html PBS NewsHour], PBS Video on "99ers"&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 19, 2010, ''[[The Daily Beast]]'' published "Get America Back to Work" which has gathered signatures&lt;ref name="sigs"&gt;[http://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/2010-08-13/the-daily-beast-manifesto/ "Get America Back to Work"] ''The Daily Beast'', 100 Signatures&lt;/ref&gt; of prominent economists, academics, journalists and historians, including five [[Nobel Prize]] [[Laureate]]s, in support of a statement calling for further stimulus to deal with long-term unemployment, citing [[Keynesian economics]] in support of their position:&lt;ref name="Daily Beast"&gt;[http://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/2010-07-19/save-the-economy-a-manifesto-by-harry-evans-joseph-stiglitz-alan-blinder-and-other-leaders/ The Daily Beast], ''Get America Back to Work'', The Daily Beast&lt;/ref&gt; The article was signed by one hundred prominent economists, historians, academics and journalists,&lt;ref name="sigs"/&gt; including: [[Joseph Stiglitz]], [[Alan Blinder]], [[John Cassidy (journalist)|John Cassidy]], [[Lizabeth Cohen]], [[Jim Hoge]], [[Robert Reich]], [[Richard Parker (economist)|Richard Parker]], [[Laura Tyson]], Sir [[Harold Evans]], [[Sean Wilentz]], [[Kenneth Arrow]], [[Peter Beinart]], [[Sidney Blumenthal]], [[Nancy Folbre]], [[Simon Schama]] and [[Robert Solow]] ([http://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/2010-08-13/the-daily-beast-manifesto/ list]).&lt;ref name="sigs"/&gt;

On August 15, 2010, ''[[The Plain Dealer]]'' ([[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]]) published an article entitled "They're Known as 'the 99ers,' and their numbers are growing in Ohio and nationwide".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cleveland.com/business/index.ssf/2010/08/theyre_known_as_the_99ers_and.html ''The Plain Dealer''], They're known as 'the 99ers,' and their numbers are growing in Ohio and nationwide, The Plain Dealer&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2010 the BBC ran a story about the 99ers titled "What happens when your unemployment benefits stop?"  The article included the views of [[Heidi Shierholz]] "We can kick people off and it will certainly make people more desperate to find a job. But in a labour market like this it's not going to make them more likely to find a job because the jobs aren't there."  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url =https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-11894634 | work= BBC| first=Rajini | last=Vaidyanathan| title=What happens when your unemployment benefits stop | date=December 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==

Republican legislators insisted that additional unemployment benefits be paid for out of existing funds. This is a departure from how unemployment benefits have been funded in the past.&lt;ref name="cbpp"/&gt;

Democratic supporters of additional unemployment extensions {{Who|date=June 2011}} have pointed out that Republicans who are calling for unemployment benefits to be paid for out of existing funds are, in some cases, the same legislators who insist the [[Bush tax cuts]] be renewed without funding.  Republicans have countered the Bush tax cuts are stimulative and therefore do not require funding.&lt;ref name="gma"&gt;[http://blogs.abcnews.com/george/2010/07/bachmann-pay-for-unemployment-benefits-not-tax-cuts.html ABC News], Bachmann: Pay for Unemployment Benefits, Not Tax Cuts, ABC News (July 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

The requirement of a supermajority to bring bills to the floor has led to heated and controversial comments, including this exchange between Senators [[Jim Bunning]] (R-KY) and [[Jeff Merkley]] (D-OR), where Senator Merkley asked Senator Bunning to stop his repeated blocks of a unanimous consent motion to extend unemployment benefits, to which Senator Bunning replied: "Tough shit."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/02/26/jim-bunning-repeatedly-bl_n_477910.html Huffington Post (26 February 2010), Politico], Jim Bunning Repeatedly Blocks Unemployment Benefits Extension, Huffington Post, Politico&lt;/ref&gt;

Several other politicians, lawmakers and commentators have made controversial statements portraying the long-term unemployed as lazy, unwilling to work, and/or on drugs,&lt;ref name="wm"&gt;[http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2010_06/024378.php Washington Monthly], Washington Monthly: "Republicans Don't Like the Unemployed"&lt;/ref&gt; while some in favor of long term unemployment benefits have called opponents pro-death and pro-child hunger.

* [[Orrin Hatch]] proposed an amendment that would require unemployment beneficiaries to pass a drug test to qualify for programs: "Drugs are a scourge on our society – hurting children, families and communities alike. This amendment is a way to help people get off of drugs to become productive and healthy members of society, while ensuring that valuable taxpayer dollars aren’t wasted.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/103357-hatch-wants-drug-tests-for-recipients-of-federal-benefits Sen. Hatch wants unemployed to face mandatory drug tests], Sen. Hatch wants unemployed to face mandatory drug tests, The Hill&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Glenn Beck]]: "Some of [the 99ers] I – frankly, I bet, should be ashamed to call them Americans"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lexisnexis.com.stlcopisa.stlcop.edu/hottopics/lnacademic LexisNexis BECK for August 16, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Alan Grayson]]: "I will say this to Republicans who will block this [unemployement benefits extension] bill now for months, and kept food out of the mouths of children. I will say to them now, may God have mercy on your souls." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/rep-alan-grayson/final-score-compassion-1_b_657491.html Huffington Post], Alan Grayson: Final Score: Compassion 1, Bullying 0&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Sharron Angle]]: "“You can make more money on unemployment than you can going down and getting one of those jobs that is an honest job, but it doesn’t pay as much.  And so that’s what’s happened to us is that we have put in so much entitlement into our government that we really have spoiled our citizenry and said you don’t want the jobs that are available.” &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.politicsdaily.com/2010/06/23/republicans-to-the-unemployed-youre-lazy/ Republicans to the Unemployed: You're Lazy], Republicans to the Unemployed: You're Lazy, Politics Daily&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Rand Paul]]: "As bad as it sounds, ultimately we do have to sometimes accept a wage that's less than we had at our previous job in order to get back to work and allow the economy to get started again.  Nobody likes that, but it may be one of the tough love things that has to happen." &lt;ref name="refhill"&gt;[http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/gop-primaries/109443-dems-seize-on-gop-candidates-comments-about-unemployed Dems seize on GOP candidates' comments about unemployed], Dems seize on GOP candidates' comments about unemployed, The Hill&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Tom Corbett]]: "People don’t want to come back to work while they still have some unemployment.  That’s becoming a problem.  The jobs are there, but if we keep extending unemployment, people are just going to sit there."&lt;ref name="refhill"/&gt;
* [[Rush Limbaugh]]: "Extended unemployment benefits do nothing but incentivize people not to look for work"&lt;ref&gt;''The Rush Limbaugh Show'', June 29, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 24, 2010, [[Cynthia Tucker]] of the ''[[Atlanta Journal-Constitution]]'', published: ''Unemployment benefits make people lazy? Not so'', where she reported how the economist [[Mark Zandi]] cited the lack of available jobs&lt;ref name="epi"/&gt; in response to a statement by Senator [[Judd Gregg]] (R-NH) that unemployment benefits discouraged the unemployed from looking for work.&lt;ref name="ajc"&gt;[http://blogs.ajc.com/cynthia-tucker/2010/05/24/unemployment-benefits-make-people-lazy-not-so The Atlanta Journal-Constitution] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100529181119/http://blogs.ajc.com/cynthia-tucker/2010/05/24/unemployment-benefits-make-people-lazy-not-so/ |date=May 29, 2010 }}, Unemployment benefits make people lazy? Not so, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution&lt;/ref&gt;

Several prominent economists have argued long term unemployment benefits are an incentive not to work, including President Obama's former White House economic adviser [[Lawrence Summers]], who once wrote in the Concise Encyclopedia of Economics: "The second way government assistance programs contribute to long-term unemployment is by providing an incentive, and the means, not to work. Each unemployed person has a 'reservation wage' — the minimum wage he or she insists on getting before accepting a job." &lt;ref name="econlib"&gt;[http://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/Unemployment.html Library of Economics and Liberty], Concise Encyclopedia of Economics&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Brookings Institution]] panel on economic activity said in March 2010 that jobless insurance extensions "correspond to between 0.7 and 1.8 percentage points of the 5.5 percentage point increase in the unemployment rate witnessed in the current recession." Alan Reynolds of the [[Cato Institute]] found nearly two percent of the current jobless rate is due to extensions of unemployment insurance and other federal policies.&lt;ref name="wsj"&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303828304575180243952375172 Wall Street Journal], Incentives Not to Work&lt;/ref&gt;

99ers have responded to these and similar statements with their own stories of repeated and unsuccessful job hunting efforts where the number of applicants have far exceeded the available positions.&lt;ref name="99ers11"/&gt;  The Economic Policy Institute's data supports the 99ers' and Mark Zandi's position in their March 2010 report of an average of five applicants for each opening.&lt;ref name="epi"&gt;[http://www.epi.org/publications/entry/job_openings_improve_but_still_more_than_5_unemployed_workers_per_avai/ Economic Policy Institute], EPI 5 applicants for each job stats&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Economic Policy Institute]], using data provided by the [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]], has verified that, as of September 2010, the U.S. economy would need to add 11.5 million jobs to make up for the shortfall due to the recession. In September 2010, the private sector added 64,000 jobs.&lt;ref name="epi1"&gt;[http://www.epi.org/publications/entry/september_jobs_picture/ Fifteen months since recession’s official end, economy short 11.5 million jobs], Fifteen months since recession’s official end, economy short 11.5 million jobs, Economic Policy Institute&lt;/ref&gt;{{Update inline|date=November 2015}}

==Hiring==

Proponents of benefits extension point out that corporations are sitting on approximately 1.8&amp;nbsp;trillion in cash while not hiring.&lt;ref&gt;[http://abcnews.go.com/Business/hoarding-hiring-corporations-stockpile-mountain-cash/story?id=10250559 ABC News Report], Hoarding, Not Hiring – Corporations Stockpile Mountain of Cash – ABC News&lt;/ref&gt; [[MSNBC]] reported in June 2010, that, for 99ers, a job can feel like a mirage:&lt;ref&gt;[http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/37404685/ns/business-economy_at_a_crossroads/ MSNBC News] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100806230103/http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/37404685/ns/business-economy_at_a_crossroads/ |date=August 6, 2010 }}, MSNBC News, For 99ers, a job can seem like a mirage&lt;/ref&gt; The Economic Policy Institute's March 2010 report cites an average of five applicants for each job opening.&lt;ref name="epi"/&gt;

==Discrimination==

Job postings with statements that only workers who are currently employed or those who've been unemployed for less than six months will be considered – thereby decreasing opportunities for the long-term unemployed – have been documented.  ''[[The Huffington Post]]'', which has chronicled the phenomenon by combing through online employment listings on sites such as [[Craigslist]] and [[Monster.com]], has found multiple listings that use the terms: "Must be currently employed, "no unemployed applicants will be considered" or "must have been employed within the last 6 months."  &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/10/22/this-week-in-jobless-disc_n_772571.html This Week In Jobless Discrimination: Unemployed Applicants Might 'Be Tempted To Steal'], This Week in Jobless Discrimination: Unemployed Applicants Might 'Be Tempted To Steal', The Huffington Post&lt;/ref&gt;

An employment recruiter for the search firm Goodwin and Associates told ''The Huffington Post'' that "some companies think that the best people are already working" and "Maybe the ones looking for jobs for some reason had a problem, or were let go for a reason, or quit for a reason, but the people companies want are the type that already have a job."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/10/08/employers-continue-to-dis_n_756136.html Employers Continue to Discriminate Against Jobless, Think 'The Best People Are Already Working], Employers Continue to Discriminate Against Jobless, Think 'The Best People Are Already Working, The Huffington Post&lt;/ref&gt;

Statistics provided by the Economic Policy Institute and the Bureau of Labor Statistics indicate the majority of long-term unemployed who lost their jobs due to the recession have been let go through no fault of their own in mass lay-offs that were cited by their companies as having been for economic reasons.&lt;ref name="epi1"/&gt;

The exclusionary jobs postings have prompted [[New Jersey]] Assemblyman Peter Barnes (D-[[Middlesex, New Jersey|Middlesex]]) to propose legislation that would impose fines of $10,000 per incident for companies that post job advertisements which say the unemployed shouldn't bother applying.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/10/13/new-law-proposed-in-new-j_n_761570.html Proposed New Jersey Law Would Penalize Employers For Discriminating Against Unemployed], Proposed New Jersey Law Would Penalize Employers For Discriminating Against Unemployed, The Huffington Post&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]] has released a report on the long-term experience of the jobless&lt;ref name="bls"&gt;[http://www.bls.gov/opub/ils/pdf/opbils82.pdf BLS (PDF)], Bureau of Labor Statistics, Long-term unemployment experience of the jobless&lt;/ref&gt; which states that, while more younger workers were unemployed, the [[Ageism#Employment|older worker]] was the most impacted by long-term unemployment, leading to concerns that ageism may factor in hiring discrimination.&lt;ref name="bls"/&gt;

==Americans with disabilities, and the long-term unemployed==

As [[Political positions of Hillary Clinton|Hillary Clinton]] asserted during the summer of 2015, "a quarter-century after passage of the [[Americans with Disabilities Act]] in 1990, it often remains difficult for [[persons with disabilities]] to gain access to meaningful and gainful employment". Many, become "99ers", as they continue to be left out of the workforce, and for those who are employed, many are in under-stimulating jobs that don't fully utilize their talents and abilities".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.hillaryclinton.com/issues/disability-rights/ |title=HillaryClinton.com - Issues - Disability Rights |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=July 26, 2015 |website=hillaryclinton.com |publisher=hillaryclinton.com |access-date=November 7, 2015 |quote="Now, 25 years after the passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act ... there is still much work to do, including improving access to meaningful and gainful employment for people with disabilities.

When you include workers who have given up looking for jobs, or those who are working part time when they want to work full time, the real number is much higher than official figures would suggest."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://berniesanders.com/issues/creating-decent-paying-jobs/ |title=Bernie 2016 - Issues - Creating Decent Paying Jobs |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website=berniesanders.com |access-date=2015-11-17 |quote= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151118023313/http://berniesanders.com/issues/creating-decent-paying-jobs/ |archivedate=November 18, 2015 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organizing==

The 99ers have begun to organize, both online and in rallies. 99ers have testified before Congress&lt;ref&gt;[http://washingtonindependent.com/86700/as-long-term-unemployment-deepens-99ers-look-for-answers Washington Independent] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100728082557/http://washingtonindependent.com/86700/as-long-term-unemployment-deepens-99ers-look-for-answers |date=July 28, 2010 }}, Washington Independent, As Long Term Unemployment Deepens, 99ers Look for Answers&lt;/ref&gt; and have started numerous online sites from which to organize, meet others in their situation&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/04/09/unemployed-friends-jobles_n_532077.html Huffington Post], Unemployed Friends: Jobless Find Support Online, Huffington Post&lt;/ref&gt; and to share links to resources.

On September 16, 2010 a coalition of numerous 99er activist groups was formed to become one large united force to lobby Washington to pass legislation that would add weeks of benefits for all those who had exhausted all benefits without yet finding a job. They called themselves the American 99ers Union&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cleveland.com/business/index.ssf/2010/09/long-term_jobless_lobby_congre.html ''The Plain Dealer''], Jobless Americans lobby Congress for extended benefits&lt;/ref&gt; and have held a number of campaigns in which they encouraged thousands of 99er activists to fax, call and email Congress in support of a Tier 5 or other method of adding extended benefits for 99ers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prlog.org/11064903-the-american-99ers-union-urges-washington-dc-to-save-america-now.html PRLog], The American 99ers Union Urges Washington, D.C. to Save America Now&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''A Man for All Seasons''''' is a play by [[Robert Bolt]] based on the life of [[Sir Thomas More]]. An early form of the play had been written for [[BBC Radio]] in 1954, and a one-hour live television version starring [[Bernard Hepton]] was produced in 1957 by the BBC,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1667059/ "''A Man for All Seasons'' Listing"] InternetMovieDatabase, accessed 23 August 2011&lt;/ref&gt; but after Bolt's success with ''The Flowering Cherry'', he reworked it for the stage.

It was first performed in London opening at the [[Gielgud Theatre|Globe Theatre]] (now Gielgud Theatre) on 1 July 1960. It later found its way to Broadway, enjoying a critically and commercially successful run of over a year. It has had several revivals, and was subsequently made into a multi-[[Academy Award]]-winning [[A Man for All Seasons (1966 film)|1966 feature film]] and a [[A Man for All Seasons (1988 film)|1988 television movie]].

The plot is based on the historical events leading up to the execution of [[Sir Thomas More]], the 16th-century [[Lord Chancellor|Chancellor of England]], who refused to endorse King [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]'s wish to divorce his wife [[Catherine of Aragon]], who did not bear him a son, so that he could marry [[Anne Boleyn]], the sister of his former mistress.
The play portrays More as a man of principle, envied by rivals such as [[Thomas Cromwell, 1st Earl of Essex|Thomas Cromwell]] and loved by the common people and by his family.

== Title ==
The title reflects 20th century agnostic playwright [[Robert Bolt]]’s portrayal of More as the ultimate man of [[conscience]]. As one who remains true to himself and his beliefs while adapting to all circumstances and times, despite external pressure or influence, More represents "a man for all seasons."  Bolt borrowed the title from [[Robert Whittington]], a contemporary of More, who in 1520 wrote of him:

::"More is a man of an angel's wit and singular learning. I know not his fellow. For where is the man of that gentleness, lowliness and affability? And, as time requireth, a man of marvelous mirth and pastimes, and sometime of as sad gravity. A man for all seasons."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholiceducation.org/en/controversy/politics-and-the-church/a-man-for-all-seasons-an-historian-s-demur.html|title=A Man for all Seasons: an Historian's Demur |publisher=Catholiceducation.org |date=4 December 1977 |accessdate=28 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File: Hans Holbein, the Younger - Sir Thomas More - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|right|Sir [[Thomas More]], one of the most famous early Lord Chancellors, served and was executed under King [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]].]]

''A Man for All Seasons'' struggles with ideas of identity and conscience. More argues repeatedly that a person is defined by his [[conscience]]. His own position is depicted as almost indefensible; the [[Pope Clement VII|Pope]] is described as a "bad" and corrupt individual, forced by the [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Charles V]] to act according to his will. But as More says to Norfolk, "What matters is not that it's true, but that I believe it; or no, not that I '''believe''' it, but that '''I''' believe it."  More fears that if he breaks with his conscience, he will be damned to hell, while his associates and friends are more concerned with holding onto their own temporal power.

At another key point of the play, More testifies before an inquiry committee and Norfolk attempts to persuade him to sign the [[Act Respecting the Oath to the Succession|Succession to the Crown Act 1534]] (pp.&amp;nbsp;78, Heinemann edition):

Norfolk:
: Oh, confound all this. ... I'm not a scholar, as Master Cromwell never tires of pointing out, and frankly, I don't know whether the marriage was lawful or not. But damn it, Thomas, look at those names. ... You know those men! Can't you do what I did, and come with us, for fellowship?

More:
: And when we stand before God, and you are sent to Paradise for doing according to your conscience, and I am damned for not doing according to mine, will you come with me, for fellowship?

More's persecution is made to seem even more unjust by the inclusion of [[Eustace Chapuys]], the long-time Imperial ambassador to England, in the story. Chapuys recognizes More as a stout man of the church, and in Act II, after More's resignation from the Chancellorship, he informs More of a planned rebellion along the Scottish border, expecting More to be sympathetic. Instead, More informs Norfolk of the plot, showing him to be patriotic and loyal to the King. This, along with More's refusal to speak out against the King, shows him to be a loyal subject, and thus Cromwell appears to prosecute him out of personal spite and because he disagrees with the King's divorce.

Bolt also establishes an anti-authoritarian theme which recurs throughout his works. All people in positions of power – King Henry, Cromwell, Wolsey, Cranmer, Chapuys, even Norfolk – are depicted as being either corrupt, evil, or at best expedient and power-hungry. Bolt's later plays and film screenplays also delve into this theme. The theme of corruption is also illustrated, in Rich's rise to power, the Common Man being drawn into the events of the storyline, and in the (deliberately) anachronistic portrayal of Henry as a younger, athletic man (in 1530 he would have been almost forty and already putting on weight).

Although it is the law that eventually forces More's execution, the play also makes several powerful statements in support of the rule of law. At one point More's future son-in-law, Roper, urges him to arrest Richard Rich, whose perjury will eventually lead to More's execution. More answers that Rich has broken no law, "And go he should if he were the Devil himself until he broke the law!"  Roper is appalled at the idea of granting the Devil the benefit of law, but More is adamant.

:"What would you do? Cut a great road through the law to get after the Devil? ... And when the last law was down, and the Devil turned round on you – where would you hide, Roper, the laws all being flat? This country is planted thick with laws from coast to coast, Man's laws, not God's, and if you cut them down – and you're just the man to do it – do you really think you could stand upright in the winds that would blow then? Yes, I give the Devil benefit of law, for my own safety's sake!"

The character of the Common Man serves as a narrator and framing device. A [[Brecht]]ian character, he plays various small parts – More's servant, a publican, a boatman, More's jailer, jury foreman and executioner—who appear throughout the play, both taking part in and commenting on the action. Several sequences involving this character break the [[fourth wall]]—most notably, a sequence where the Common Man attempts to exit the stage and is addressed by Cromwell, who identifies him as a jury foreman. (Indeed, the "jury" consists of sticks or poles with the hats of the Common Man's various characters put on top.) The place of the Common Man in history is emphasized when he says in his opening speech,

"the sixteenth century was the century of the Common Man-like all the other centuries."

Bolt created the Common Man for two main reasons: to illustrate the place and influence of the average person in history, even though they are usually overlooked, and to try to prevent the audience from sympathising with the more titled characters such as More, realising that the audience is more closely related to him—a classic case of Brechtian [[alienation effect|alienation]]. The character's role in the story has been interpreted in many different ways by different critics, from being a positive to a negative character. Bolt's own view (expressed in the preface to the play) was that he was intended to draw the audience into the play and that "common" denoted "that which is common to us all." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Man for All seasons|last=Bolt|first=Robert|publisher=Heinemann|year=1963|isbn=|editor-last=Wood|editor-first=E.R.|edition=The Hereford Plays|location=London|pages=xviii|orig-year=1960}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several of Bolt's subsequent works feature similar characters (e.g. ''The Thwarting of Baron Bolligrew,'' ''[[State of Revolution]]'').

== Endings ==
{{Refimprove section|date=July 2015}}
Two different endings were written by Bolt. The original ending, performed during the show's preliminary run in England, had Cromwell and Chapuys confront each other after More's execution and then exit the stage, hand in hand, chuckling with "the self-mocking, self-indulgent, rather rueful laughter of the men who know what the world is and how to be comfortable in it".

This particular ending is exemplary of Bolt's notion of "riding with the current", as is demonstrated by "men who know what the world is and how to be comfortable in it", forsaking one's conscience in exchange of a life of "convenience". For the show's London production – and most, if not all, subsequent runs of the show – the Common Man sheds his executioner's garb and addresses the audience one final time:

:"... It isn't difficult to keep alive, friends – just don't make trouble – or if you must make trouble, make the sort of trouble that's expected... If we should bump into one another, recognize me."

The [[A Man for All Seasons (1966 film)|film version]] of the play ends with More's execution, followed by a narrator reading off the fates of the various characters involved (originally, this was dialogue spoken by the Common Man prior to the Tower of London Inquiry).

==Stage productions==
[[Paul Scofield]], who played the leading role in the West End premiere, reprised it on Broadway in 1961, winning a [[Tony Award]]. Both productions were directed by [[Noel Willman]].

The original West End cast, playing at the [[Gielgud Theatre|Globe Theatre]] (now Gielgud Theatre), included:
*The Common Man – [[Leo McKern]]
*[[Thomas More|Sir Thomas More]] – [[Paul Scofield]]
*[[Richard Rich, 1st Baron Rich|Richard Rich]] – John Brown
*[[Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk|Duke of Norfolk]] – [[Alexander Gauge]]
*[[Alice, Lady More|Alice More]] – Wynne Clark
*[[Margaret Roper|Margaret]] – [[Pat Keen]]
*[[Thomas Wolsey|Cardinal Wolsey]] – [[Willoughby Goddard]]
*[[Thomas Cromwell, 1st Earl of Essex|Thomas Cromwell]] – [[Andrew Keir]]
*[[Eustace Chapuys|Chapuys]] – Geoffrey Dunn
*Attendant – Brian Harrison
*[[William Roper (biographer)|Will Roper]] – [[John Carson (actor)|John Carson]]
*[[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] – [[Richard Leech]]
*Woman – Beryl Andrews
*[[Thomas Cranmer|Archbishop Cranmer]] – William Roderick

In London, ''Man'' ran simultaneously to another of Bolt's plays, ''[[The Tiger and the Horse]]''. Both plays were major hits, although ''Horse'' was the more successful of the two. British critical reaction was largely positive, albeit reservedly so; few reviews at the time regarded the play as a classic. The show ran for 320 performances.

In the USA, the play was first performed on Broadway on 22 November 1961, at the [[ANTA Playhouse]]

'''Original Broadway cast'''
*The Common Man – [[George Rose (actor)|George Rose]]
*[[Thomas More|Sir Thomas More]] – [[Paul Scofield]]
*[[Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk|The Duke of Norfolk]] – [[Albert Dekker]]
*[[Thomas Cromwell, 1st Earl of Essex|Thomas Cromwell]] – [[Leo McKern]] (later [[Thomas Gomez]])
*[[Henry VIII of England|King Henry VIII]] – [[Keith Baxter (actor)|Keith Baxter]]
*[[Margaret Roper|Margaret More]] – Olga Bellin
*[[William Roper (biographer)|William Roper]] – Peter Brandon
*Catherine Anger – Sarah Burton
*Attendant – John Colenback
*[[Thomas Wolsey|Cardinal Wolsey]] – Jack Creley
*[[Alice, Lady More|Alice More]]- [[Carol Goodner]]
*[[Thomas Cranmer]] – Lester Rawlins
*[[Richard Rich, 1st Baron Rich|Richard Rich]] – [[William Redfield (actor)|William Redfield]]
*[[Eustace Chapuys|Signor Chapuys]] – [[David J. Stewart]]

The Broadway production was a huge hit, running for 620 performances. While the play had drawn mixed critical reviews in London, it was almost unanimously praised by the New York critics, who showered it with plaudits and awards.

Leo McKern played the Common Man in the West End version of the show, but was shifted to the role of Cromwell for the Broadway production – a role he later reprised in the film. While playing Cromwell, he appeared with one brown and one blue eye (McKern of course had lost an eye in an accident and wore a glass one) to accentuate his character's evil nature.

[[Charlton Heston]] played More in several versions of the play-off-Broadway in the 1970s and 1980s, eventually playing it on the West End. The play was a success and the West End production was taken to Aberdeen, Scotland, for a week where it was staged at His Majesty's Theatre. Heston considered it among his favourite roles. He also produced, directed, and starred in a film version of it (see below). The production gained a sort of notoriety when Dustin Hoffman spread the story that Heston, who was bald, was so vain that he wore a wig over his hairpiece, rather than let the public view his actual bald pate.

Another famous graduate of the play is [[Ian McKellen]], whose first theatrical role was as Will Roper in a revival production in the late 1960s. He would go on to play More in a later run of the show. [[Faye Dunaway]] also made her stage debut as a replacement Margaret in the original Broadway run.

An acclaimed Canadian production starring [[William Hutt (actor)|William Hutt]] and directed by [[Walter Learning]] was presented at the [[Vancouver Playhouse (theatre venue)|Vancouver Playhouse]] and the [[Stratford Festival]] in 1986. At Stratford the production was paired with a production of Shakespeare's ''Henry VIII'', with both plays sharing many actors, and showing two perspectives on historical events.

The play was staged in London's West End at the [[Haymarket Theatre|Theatre Royal, Haymarket]] starring [[Martin Shaw]] and produced by [[Bill Kenwright]]. It closed on 1 April 2006.

A Broadway revival of the show, produced by the [[Roundabout Theatre Company]], starring [[Frank Langella]] as More and directed by [[Doug Hughes]], played at the [[American Airlines Theatre]] through December 2008. In this production, the character of The Common Man was deleted by the director (as Bolt had done when adapting his play for the first film version).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cox |first=Gordon |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117986277.html?categoryid=15&amp;cs=1&amp;nid=2563 |title=Frank Langella to be 'Man' on B'way – Entertainment News, Legit News, Media – Variety |publisher=Variety.com |date=21 May 2008 |accessdate=23 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{anchor|HK-antiCommunist01a}}In 2008, Thomas More was also portrayed on stage in [[Hong Kong]] as an [[allegorical]] symbol of the [[Pro-democracy camp in Hong Kong|Pan-democracy camp]] resisting [[Chinese Communism]] when Hardy Tsoi, after translating ''A Man for All Seasons'', mainly into [[Cantonese]], but also with some parts in [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Latin]], and English, produced it as a play within a play.&lt;ref name=ChapmanChen01a/&gt; Similarities were noted between More and contemporary pro-democracy politicians in Hong Kong such as [[Martin Lee]] and [[Szeto Wah]], with the [[Holy See|Vatican]] being seen as representing [[British Hong Kong|British colonialism]] while Henry VIII and his regime were seen as representing [[China|Communist China]] "suppressing democracy and freedom" in Hong Kong.&lt;ref name=ChapmanChen01a&gt;{{cite book

==Film and TV movies==
The play was [[A Man for All Seasons (1964 film)|adapted for Australian television in 1964]].
===1966 film===
{{main article|A Man for All Seasons (1966 film)}}

[[Paul Scofield]], who played the leading role in the West End and Broadway stage premieres, played More again in the first of two film versions (1966), winning an [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Oscar]] in the process. The film also stars [[Robert Shaw (British actor)|Robert Shaw]] as Henry VIII, [[Orson Welles]] as [[Thomas Wolsey|Wolsey]], [[Corin Redgrave]] as Will Roper, [[Nigel Davenport]] as Norfolk, a young [[John Hurt]] as [[Richard Rich, 1st Baron Rich|Richard Rich]], and an older [[Wendy Hiller]] as Lady Alice, More's second wife. It was directed by [[Fred Zinnemann]]. In addition to the [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor Oscar]] won by Scofield, the film won [[Academy Awards]] for screenplay, [[Academy Award for Best Cinematography|cinematography]], costume design, [[Academy Award for Directing|Best Director]], and [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]].

===1988 film===
{{main article|A Man for All Seasons (1988 film)}}

The 1988 version starred [[Charlton Heston]] (who also directed it) as More, [[Vanessa Redgrave]] (who appeared briefly and mutely in the 1966 version as [[Anne Boleyn]]) as More's wife, and Sir [[John Gielgud]] as Cardinal Wolsey. By coincidence, Gielgud's name now graces the former [[Gielgud Theatre|Globe Theatre]], where the original play premiered in 1960.

'''AboveNet''' was a provider of high [[Bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]] [[telecommunication circuit]]s primarily for large corporate enterprises and communications carriers in 17 markets in the United States and four markets in Europe. Its private optical network delivered key network and IP services and was used in financial and legal services, media, health care, retail, and government.

The company was formerly named Metromedia Fiber Network and changed its name to AboveNet in 2003 after emerging from [[bankruptcy]].

Before its bankruptcy in 2002, the company was financially backed by [[John Kluge]] and [[Verizon]].

In 2012, the company was acquired by [[Zayo Group]] for $2.2 billion in cash.

==History==
The company was founded in 1993 as National Fiber Network. It initially focused on providing [[dark fiber]] to communications carrier customers in the U.S. and Europe. 

In 1997, the company changed its name to Metromedia Fiber Network.

In 1999, Metromedia acquired Abovenet Communications, including its subsidiary [[PAIX]], an operator of Internet [[peering]] exchanges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB930142020565956674 | title=Metromedia Fiber Network Plans To Buy AboveNet for $1.76 Billion | work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] | date=June 24, 1999}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/06/24/business/company-news-metromedia-to-buy-abovenet-for-1.55-billion.html | title=Metromedia to Buy Abovenet for $1.55 Billion | agency=[[Reuters]] | publisher=[[The New York Times]] | date=June 24, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://money.cnn.com/1999/06/23/deals/metromedia/ | title=Metromedia buys AboveNet | work=[[CNNMoney]] | date=June 24, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abovenet Communications had become a [[public company]] via an [[initial public offering]] in December 1998 and soared 32% in one day in March 1999 during the [[dot-com bubble]] after announcing a [[stock split]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/03/31/business/abovenet-to-split-stock.html | title=Abovenet to Split Stock | agency=[[Dow Jones &amp; Company]] | publisher=[[The New York Times]] | date=March 31, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, the company acquired M.I.B.H., a networking consultancy operated by [[Paul Vixie]], for $51 million in cash and stock.

Also in 2000, [[Verizon]] invested $970 million in [[convertible bond]]s and $715.4 million in common stock of the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/07/31/business/technology-verizon-may-write-down-big-fiber-optic-investment.html | title=Verizon May Write Down Big Fiber Optic Investment | first=Simon | last=Romero | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=July 21, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, the company acquired SiteSmith, a provider of managed web-hosting services, for $1.36 billion in stock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://money.cnn.com/2000/10/10/deals/metromedia/ | title=Metromedia buys SiteSmith | work=[[CNNMoney]] | date=October 10, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://articles.latimes.com/2000/oct/11/business/fi-34755 | title=Metromedia Fiber Network Plans Acquisition of SiteSmith | agency=[[Reuters]] | publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]] | date=October 11, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2002, the company filed [[bankruptcy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/05/21/business/technology-metromedia-fiber-files-for-bankruptcy.html | title=Metromedia Fiber Files for Bankruptcy | first=Simon | last=Romero | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=May 21, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2003, the company emerged from bankruptcy and changed its name to Abovenet, with [[Craig McCaw]], Franklin Mutual Advisers, and [[John Kluge]] among its largest shareholders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/09/09/business/technology-briefing-hardware-abovenet-emerges-from-bankruptcy.html | title=AboveNet Emerges From Bankruptcy | agency=[[Bloomberg News]] | publisher=[[The New York Times]] | date=September 9, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2006, [[Digital Realty]] acquired the east coast [[data center]]s of the company for $40 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | url=http://investor.digitalrealty.com/investor-relations/news-and-events/news/news-details/2006/Digital-Realty-Trust-Inc-Acquires-Datacenters-in-New-York-City-and-Northern-Virginia-From-AboveNet/default.aspx | title=Digital Realty Trust, Inc.

Following the failed attempt to reopen the Castello Road, there were reports of a crisis between the [[Army of Conquest]] and [[Fatah Halab]] due to disagreements over Aleppo. Jaysh al-Fateh reportedly wanted to stop the fighting at Mallah altogether and were trying to organize Fatah Halab, but little if anyone inside Aleppo wanted to accept orders from Idlib commanders, and therefore Jaysh al-Fateh's was losing patience as Aleppo commanders were preferring to lose men, ammunition and materials for what they saw as a lost battle. Jaysh al-Fateh wanted to begin an offensive south of Aleppo rather than at Mallah with a serious strategy, but Fatah Halab reportedly wouldn't agree to this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite tweet|user=Syria_Rebel_Obs|author=Syrian Rebellion Obs|number=752067232319082496|date=10 July 2016|title=#SRO - IMPORTANT - Jaysh al-Fateh want to put its plan for South #Aleppo with a serious strategy but Fatah #Halab don't want obey...(5).

On 11 July, the rebels made an attempt to relieve pressure on the Mallah front by attacking Aleppo's city center. The assault started with the detonation of a [[Tunnel warfare|tunnel bomb]] that killed 19 soldiers. After the tunnel blast, a group of 7 rebel fighters emerged behind Army lines from another tunnel on a suicide mission to inflict maximum casualties.

Following the second failed rebel counter-attack against the Castello Road, the [[Ahrar al-Sham]] rebel group, which had not participated in the offensive, criticized rebel forces who were attempting to retake the Mallah Farms by stating it was "military suicide.

Ahrar al-Sham was itself criticized by other rebel groups for not participating in the fighting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.almasdarnews.com/article/us-backed-rebel-group-disavows-northern-aleppo-offensive/|title=US-backed rebel group disavows northern Aleppo offensive|first=Zen|last=Adra|date=13 July 2016|publisher=|accessdate=15 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Alien Autopsy''''' is a 2006 British comedy film with elements of science fiction, directed by [[Jonny Campbell]]. Written by [[William Davies (screenwriter)|William Davies]], it relates the events surrounding the famous "[[alien autopsy]]" film promoted by [[Ray Santilli]] and stars [[Ant McPartlin]] and [[Declan Donnelly]], also known as [[Ant &amp; Dec]]. The film was a moderate commercial success domestically, making no. 3 on the British box office chart.

==Plot==
The film is framed by [[Ray Santilli]] and his friend [[Gary Shoefield]] retelling the events to a documentary maker.

In 1995, Ray and Gary go to America to find [[Elvis]] memorabilia to sell on the market stall Ray runs in London. A former [[US Army]] [[cameraman]], Harvey, sells them a silent [[black and white]] film of Elvis performing live, but later return with an intriguing offer. Harvey takes Ray to [[Miami, Florida]] to see a film from 1947 showing the [[autopsy]] of an [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] supposedly killed in a [[UFO]] crash in [[Roswell, New Mexico]]. Harvey want to sell the film for $30,000.

Gary and Ray return to England to look for an investor to give them the money. Ray convinces Laszlo Voros, a Hungarian art dealer obsessed with [[crop circles]], to give him the $30,000 and retrieves the film from Harvey. Back in England, the pair discover that the film has [[Cellulose acetate film#Decay and the "vinegar syndrome"|degraded]] from humidity and heat and is now completely unwatchable. In order to avoid serious repercussions from Voros, they decide to make their own recreation of it. They base the content on Ray's memories of the original, and, with the help of some friends, fashion a convincing replica of the dead alien using a mannequin and meat products obtained from a friend's butcher's shop, turn the living room of Gary's sister into a [[film set]], and shoot the film on a [[Bell and Howell]] spring-wound camera. Ray gives a copy of the final product to Voros, who believes it to be real.

Having convinced Voros, Ray and Gary decide to sell the film to other venues, earning them a large sum of money. However, when Voros hears about its international distribution, he demands 80% of the profits. A potential clash is averted when Voros killed by a green [[Land Rover]] while standing naked in the middle of a crop circle, leading to speculation that he has been killed by a [[CIA]] agent.

Ray and Gary travel to [[Argentina]] to promote the film, followed by reporter Amber Fuentes, who seduces Ray. She eventually tracks down Harvey, who demands from Ray and Gary that they maintain his anonymity. To fulfil this obligation, they produce an interview with a homeless former actor playing Harvey, which convinces Amber. She remains sceptical, however, about the film's authenticity.

Ray and Gary are now persuaded that some of the original 1947 footage might actually be recovered by [[film restoration]] experts in order to be viewed. However, after viewing the results, the pair bury the film, telling each other that they cannot continue with the endeavour.

==Biography==
Born in [[Shibpur Upazila|Shibpur]], Asaduzzaman graduated from Shibpur High School in 1960 and subsequently studied at [[Jagannath University]] (then known as Jagannath College) and [[Murari Chand College]]. After passing the latter in 1963, he entered the [[University of Dhaka]], receiving a Bachelor of Arts (Hons.) in 1966 and a [[Master of Arts|Masters of Arts]] in 1967. In that year, he organised the [[Jatiya Krishak Samity|Krishak Samity]] in [[Shibpur Upazila|Shibpur]], [[Monohardi Upazila|Monohardi]], [[Raipura Upazila, Narsingdi|Raipura]] and [[Narsingdi District|Narsingdi]] areas at the direction of [[Maulana Abdul Hamid Khan Bhashani]], President of [[National Awami Party]] and Krishak Samity.

After studying at City Law College in Dhaka, Asaduzzaman sat in 1968 for a second M.A. exam in an effort to receive a better result.&lt;ref name="BoiAsad"&gt;[http://shaheedasad.com/biography.html Biography of Shaeed Asad]{{Dead link|date=October 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of his death in 1969, he was in the final year of his M.A. at Dhaka University's Department of History.&lt;ref name="banglapedia"/&gt; He was the president of the Dhaka Hall unit of [[East Pakistan]] Students Union and General Secretary of the Dhaka branch of what was at the time the [[East Pakistan]] Students Union (EPSU, Menon group).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Promises to Keep |url=http://archive.thedailystar.net/magazine/2009/07/05/cover.htm |work=Star Weekend Magazine |publisher=The Daily Star |date=31 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his political activities, Asaduzzaman was interested in the educational rights of the poor and powerless. He founded a night school named Shibpur Naisha Biddalaya and collected funds for setting up a college (Shibpur College) for local people.&lt;ref name="banglapedia"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BoiAsad"/&gt;

==20 January 1969==

===Background===
The catalyst for the events leading to Asaduzzaman's death include the [[Six point movement]] of [[Sheikh Mujibur Rahman]] and the [[Agartala Conspiracy Case]] at which Rahman and dozens of others were charged with [[sedition]] by the [[Government of Pakistan]]. Student groups were already experiencing considerable unrest when, in December 1968, [[Maulana Abdul Hamid Khan Bhashani]] organised a march against the Governors House, in conjunction with several [[trade unions|labour associations]] arranged a Repression Resistance Day on 6 December 1968, and proclaimed a [[hartal]] against merchants.&lt;ref name="banglapedia2"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kamal |first1=Mesbah |last2=Kibria |first2=Arifatul |year=2012 |chapter=Mass Upsurge, 1969 |chapter-url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Mass_Upsurge,_1969 |editor1-last=Islam |editor1-first=Sirajul |editor1-link=Sirajul Islam |editor2-last=Jamal |editor2-first=Ahmed A. |title=Banglapedia: National Encyclopedia of Bangladesh |edition=Second |publisher=[[Asiatic Society of Bangladesh]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 4 January 1969, an 11-point programme—an expansion of Rahman's six-point movement—was publicised by a coalition of student group leaders, including the group for which Asaduzzaman served as an officer. In a meeting at Dhaka University on 17 January 1969, student protestors decided to unite all campuses of East Pakistan on 20 January 1969, in strike.&lt;ref name="banglapedia"/&gt; Governor [[Abdul Monem Khan|Monem Khan]] sought to prevent the action by imposing Section 144 on the students, under which no more than four persons were permitted to assemble.&lt;ref name="banglapedia"/&gt;

===Procession and death===
At around noon on 20 January 1969, the students enacted their planned protest, with a procession in front of [[Dhaka Medical College Hospital]] heading towards Chan Khar Pool. Police charged near Chand Khan's bridge, but the protestors resisted. About an hour into the conflict, Asaduzzaman and other student leaders tried to continue the procession. Asaduzzaman was shot from very close range by a police officer. Seriously injured, Asaduzzaman was admitted to the hospital, where he was declared dead.&lt;ref name="banglapedia"/&gt;&lt;ref name="newagebd"&gt;{{cite news|title=Shaheed Asad Day today |url=http://www.newagebd.com/2005/jan/20/front.html |newspaper=[[New Age (Bangladesh)|New Age]] |date=20 January 2005 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050226172308/http://www.newagebd.com/2005/jan/20/front.html |archive-date=26 February 2005 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Shaheed Asad Day observed |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/2006/01/21/d60121061374.htm |newspaper=The Daily Star |date=21 January 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="StarCampus"&gt;{{cite news |title=Sixty Three Years of Dhaka Medical College |url=http://archive.thedailystar.net/campus/2009/07/03/camspotlight.htm |work=Star Campus |publisher=The Daily Star |date=19 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
Thousands of students and common people mourned Asaduzzaman together in procession, carrying his blood-stained shirt to [[Shaheed Minar, Dhaka|Shaheed Minar]]. The Central Action Committee announced the 22, 23 and 24 January as a "mourning-period" for him, also striking on those days. On the final day, police once again opened fire. As a result, the administration of Field Marshal Ayub Khan was forced to terminate within two months from the day Asad died.&lt;ref name="banglapedia"/&gt;&lt;ref name="StarCampus"/&gt;&lt;ref name="holiday"&gt;{{cite news|title=Shaheed Asad's dreams remain unfulfilled |url=http://www.weeklyholiday.net/2010/220110/met.html |newspaper=[[Holiday (newspaper)|Holiday]] |date=22 January 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720024314/http://www.weeklyholiday.net/2010/220110/met.html |archive-date=20 July 2011 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Remembrance==
In many places of the country, people replaced the nameplates of Ayub Khan with the name of Shaheed Asad. In time, Ayub Gate was renamed [[Mohammadpur Thana|Asad Gate]], Ayub Avenue as Asad Avenue and Ayub Park as Asad Park.

In 1970, on the first Asad Day, people constructed a monument, Unsatturer Gono-aubyuthaner Swarak O Aumor Asad, at the point in front of the central gate of Dhaka Medical College Hospital where Asad was shot dead. The local people of Shibpur and Dhanua established Shibpur Shaheed Asad College in 1970. In 1991, the inhabitants of Asad's own village Dhauna founded Shaheed Asad Collegiate Girls School and College.&lt;ref name="banglapedia"/&gt;{{failed verification|date=January 2017}}&lt;ref name="BoiAsad"/&gt;

Shaheed Asad Day is observed on 20 January each year in recognition of Shaheed Asad's sacrifice, which led the nation towards mass upsurge and independence.&lt;ref name="newagebd"/&gt;

The '''Aranmula Boat Race''' the oldest river boat fiesta in [[Kerala]], the south western State of [[India]] is held during Onam (August–September). It takes place at [[Aranmula]], near a Hindu temple dedicated to [[Lord Krishna]] and [[Arjuna]] in Pathanamthitta district of Kerala State.  The [[snake boat]]s move in pairs to the rhythm of full-throated singing and shouting watched by an exciting crowd.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Kerala]] Companion, [[Kerala]] Tourism Dept. Page 40.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1972, [[snake boat]] races were also added to the program of the festival. Thousands of people gather on the banks of the river [[Pampa]] to watch the [[snake boat races]]. In 2009 forty one [[snake boat]]s or [[chundan vallam]]s had participated in the festival. The oarsmen sing traditional boat songs and wear white [[mundu]] and [[turbans]]. The golden lace at the head of the boat, the flag and the ornamental umbrella at the center make it a show of pageantry too.

==Aranmula temple==
[[Aranmula]] is about 128&amp;nbsp;km from [[Trivandrum]], capital city of [[Kerala]]. It is situated on the banks of the river [[Pampa]] in Pathanamthitta district of Kerala. The famous temple at [[Aranmula]] is dedicated to Sree Parthasarathy of Lord [[Krishna]] as the divine charioteer of [[Arjuna]]. A rough estimate puts the age of this temple to 1700 years.

==Palliyodams (snake boats)==
[[Image:Kerala boatrace.jpg|thumb|500px|right|Aranmula Uthrattathi Boat Race]]
Palliyodams are [[Aranmula]]’s unique [[snake boat]]s (‘’[[Chundan Vallam]]’’) which devotees hold in reverence, considering it as the divine vessel of the presiding deity in Sree Parthasarathy temple. These Palliyodams belong to different ‘’karas’’ (rustic parts) on the banks of river [[Pampa]]. Each one will usually have 4 helmsmen, rowers and singers. It is decorated with golden lace.  There will be a flag and two or three ornamental [[umbrella]]s.

===Construction===
Locating a suitable tree preferably Anjili, cutting it down and bringing to the location for construction is the first step. Selecting an auspicious day and time work begins. All these are according to [[Vedas]], an ancient treatise on building of wooden boats. These boats are about 100 to 138 ft in length, with the rear portion towering to a height of about 20 ft. and a long tapering front portion. When completed it resembles a [[snake]] with its hood raised. Its hull is built of planks precisely 83 feet in length and six inches wide.

===Care of a snake boat===
Every year the boats are oiled mainly with fish oil, [[coconut]] shell, and carbon, mixed with eggs to keep the wood strong and the boat slippery in the water. The village [[carpenter]] carries out annual repairs and people take pride in their boat, which is named after and represents their village.

===Getting onto a snake boat===
#Only men of the village are allowed to be in the boat.
#Dress. White loin cloth ([[Mundu]]) and [[turban]].
#No shirt and footwear.

Traditionally it will be commanded by a Kaarnavan / Karanaadhan (Village leader) with ''First Adanayampu'' and under him there will be three main oarsmen who control the movement of the boat with 12 feet long main rudder-oar (Adanayampu). Sitting two in row along the length of the Boat  there will be the oarsmen, They row in rhythm of the vanchipattu (boatman's song).  Standing on the platform in the middle of the boat, the main singer will lead the vanchipattu. A few singers will be with the main leader while others will stand at the middle between the oarsmen.

===Vanchipattu===
The singers lead the ‘’Vanchipattu’’ (song) which the oarsmen will repeat and they move the oars in circular form according to its rhythm. Usually the selection will be from ‘’Kuchela vrythom Vanchipattu.’’

Example: (in Malayalam)
Note that The oar should make one full circle between the dashes (-).

==Festivals==
A number of colourful festivals rich in traditions are held at [[Aranmula]] temple every year. The most important festival is the traditional palliyodam [[regatta]] (boat festival). Three important events take place in which the Palliyodams participate. All these are solemn religious custom and there were no competitive races.

===Thiruvonam===
On ‘’Thiruv[[onam]]’’ day people of [[Kerala]] celebrate it with a feast. [[Aranmula]] celebrations begin with the arrival of Thiruvonathoni (special boats) from [[Kattoor, Pathanamthitta|Kattoor]]. For a sumptuous meal for the Lord at [[Aranmula]], a boat with the necessary provisions, and an ever-burning lamp, set off its journey from the temple at [[Kattoor, Pathanamthitta|Kattoor]] at 6 pm so that it could reach [[Aranmula]] temple by 4 am the next day, the Thiruonam day. At 6 pm long main rudder-oar (Adanayampu) will be presented to the temple at [[Kattoor, Pathanamthitta|Kattoor]] and then it will be handed over to the leading oarsman. Mr. [[Bhattathiri]] of Mangaatt [[Illam]] with 18 men will get into the boat and it will begin its journey to [[Aranmula]]. The boat is expected to float according to the speed of the current. The sound of the [[nagaswaram]] (musical pipe) could be heard from a distance. People from all walks of life, age and religion will assemble on the river bank and they will float lighted lamps on the river welcoming the Thiruvonathoni. It is believed that the palliyodams were built to protect this Thiruvonathoni. So early morning on Thiruv[[onam]] day all these palliyodams will accompany the Thiruvonathoni.

===Uthrittathi===
It is considered that ‘’Uthrittathi’’ day is the anniversary of the installation of the idol consecrated in the south, by [[Pandava]]s. So on that day, there will be a [[Snake boat]] [[regatta]] in front of the [[Aranmula]] temple.

===Aranmula Vallasadya===
[[File:Sadhya DSW.jpg|thumb|250px|right|A Typical [[Onam]] Feast. Onam is a major festival of Kerala.]]
Another important event is the ''Aranmula Valla[[sadya]]’’ (banquet). It is served to the oarsmen of [[snake boat]]s at the Parthasarthy temple premises and at nearby dining hall and auditorium. it starts in mid july (karkitakam) and will last till September.( kanni month) 
254 valla[[sadya]]s were held in 2008 besides the mega feast on Ashtami Rohini. For this mega feast as many as 50,000 people from different parts of the state took part. Rice with 68 side dishes were served at the [[Sadya]] on banana leaves including the following side dishes.&lt;ref&gt;Desabhimani, December 30, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Valla sadya is performed with a strict style. First, one who offers the feast has to invite the ''karanathan''. On the day he has to put two 'nirapara's down the 'kodimaram' flag post, with betel, and tobacco and aracca nut. Around 11 o'clock the boat people will come in the decorated boat with vallapattu. They are welcomed with thalappoli and these offerings, and are marched with rhythmic slogans first in front to the god and then to the separate hall arranged for the feast. They are treated with whatever they ask, and after the feast they are sent back following up to the river.

'''Bankocracy''' (from the English word [[bank]] and [[Ancient Greek]] κράτος - ''kratos'', "power, rule") or '''trapezocracy'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://yanisvaroufakis.eu/2011/03/02/the-road-to-bankruptocracy-how-events-since-2009-have-led-to-a-new-mode-of-reproduction/ |title=The Road to Bankruptocracy: How events since 2009 have led to a new mode of reproduction |author=[[Yanis Varoufakis]] |date= 2 March  2011|work= |publisher= |accessdate=19 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; (from Greek τράπεζα -  ''trapeza'', "bank") is a polemic term referring to the excessive power or influence of [[bank]]s on [[public policy]]-making.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Britain is ruled by the banks, for the banks |author=Chakrabortty, Aditya |url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/dec/12/britain-ruled-by-banks |newspaper=The Guardian |date= 12 December 2011 |accessdate=18 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can also refer to a [[form of government]] where [[financial institution]]s rule society.

==Usage==
One of the first uses of the term was by British Member of Parliament [[William Fullarton]] (1754–1808), who in a parliamentary debate on April 10, 1797 characterized the monopoly of the [[Bank of England]] as being a more important issue to solve than the peace attempts to end the [[Campaigns of 1797 in the French Revolutionary Wars|war against France]]:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1790-1820/member/fullarton-william-1754-1808 FULLARTON,  William (1754-1808), of Fullarton, Ayr. | History of Parliament Online]&lt;/ref&gt; {{cquote|It is Bankocracy that threatens the destruction of social order ... that turns and overturns all questions respecting war, negotiations, and peace.}}

United States Senator [[Robert J. Walker]] (1801–1869), a staunch opponent of the [[Second Bank of the United States|Bank of the United States]], delivered a speech in the [[US Senate|Senate]] on January 21, 1840, where he warned that the acceptance of [[Banknote|paper money]] as legal tender would "overthrow the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]], subvert the liberties of the country, and the rights of the people, and establish the reign of a bankocracy, more sordid, ruinous, and despotic, than that of any monarch, however absolute."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Speech of Mr. Walker, of Mississippi, on the bill to provide for the collection, safe-keeping, and disbursement of the public money: Senate U.S. January 21, 1840.

[[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] used the term in his work ''Les Confessions d’un révolutionnaire'' (1849), in reference to the [[July Monarchy]]:&lt;ref&gt;[https://en.wikisource.org/w/index.php?title=Confessions_of_a_Revolutionary/5 Proudhon, Pierre-Joseph (1849). Confessions of a Revolutionary V. 1830-1848: Government Corruption]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{cquote|The principle of the July government, founded by and for the middle class, was therefore property, the capital. Under a monarchical form, the essence of that government was ''bankocracy''.}}

The term was also used by [[Karl Marx]] in his work ''[[Das Kapital|Das Kapital, Kritik der politischen Ökonomie]]'' (1867). He theorizes the birth of [[national debt]] as the catalyst for the [[primitive accumulation of capital]]:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch31.htm Marx, Karl (1867). Capital, Vol. I. Chapter Thirty-One: Genesis of the Industrial Capitalist]&lt;/ref&gt; {{cquote|The public debt becomes one of the most powerful levers of primitive accumulation. ... [T]he national debt has given rise to joint-stock companies, to dealings in negotiable effects of all kinds, and to agiotage, in a word to stock-exchange gambling and the modern bankocracy.}}

In [[Marxian economics]], the term cognates with [[finance capitalism]] in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Dictionary of Philosophical Terms vol. II - English-German / Englisch-Deutsch

The '''Carrollton bus collision''' occurred on May 14, 1988, on [[Interstate 71]] in unincorporated [[Carroll County, Kentucky]]. Involving a former [[school bus]] in use by a church youth group and a pickup truck driven by an impaired driver, the head-on collision was the deadliest incident involving [[Driving under the influence|drunk driving]] and the third-deadliest bus crash in United States history. Of the 67 people on the bus (counting the driver), there were 27 fatalities in the accident, the same number as the 1958 [[Prestonsburg bus disaster|Prestonsburg, Kentucky, bus disaster]] and behind the 1976 [[Yuba City bus disaster]] (29) and 1963 [[1963 Chualar bus crash|Chualar bus crashes]] (32).

In the aftermath of the disaster, several family members of victims became active leaders of [[Mothers Against Drunk Driving]] (MADD), and one ([[Karolyn Nunnallee]]) became national president of the organization. The standards for both operation and equipment for school buses and similar buses were improved in Kentucky and many other states. These include an increased number of emergency exits, higher standards for structural integrity, and the use of less volatile [[diesel fuel]] (over gasoline). On [[Interstate 71]], the crash site is marked with a highway sign erected by the [[Kentucky Transportation Cabinet]] (KYTC).Memorial items such as crosses and flower arrangements are regularly placed at the site by families and friends.

==Background==

On May 14, 1988, a youth group consisting of mostly teenagers who attended [[North Hardin High School]], James T. Alton Middle School, Radcliff Middle School and four adults from [[Assemblies of God USA|Assembly of God]] in [[Radcliff, Kentucky]] boarded their church activity bus and headed to [[Kings Island]] [[amusement park|theme park]] in [[Mason, Ohio]] (north of [[Cincinnati]], about 170 miles from Radcliff). The group included church members and their invited guests. As everyone arrived early that Saturday morning, those wanting to go on the trip had grown to more than originally anticipated. The church's principal pastor (who stayed behind) restricted the ridership to the legal limit of 66 persons plus the driver.

===Bus===

The church bus involved in the crash was a conventional type body-on-chassis [[school bus]] model. The 1977 [[Ford B-Series|Ford B700]] school bus chassis was equipped with a [[Superior Coach Company|Superior]] school bus body, a model with 11 rows of {{convert|39|in|cm}} wide seats on either side of a central aisle {{convert|12|in|cm}} wide. The bus was ordered by the Kentucky Department of Schools in 1976, as part of an order of over 600 units for districts throughout the state.

The chassis was manufactured at Ford's expansive [[Kentucky Truck Assembly|Kentucky Truck Plant]] located in [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]] and then was shipped to [[Lima, Ohio]], where the body was installed at [[Superior Coach Company]], a company owned by industrial conglomerate [[Sheller-Globe Corporation]]. It was certified as a "[[school bus]]" with an effective build date of "March 23, 1977," which is when the chassis began production, as required by federal regulations. Both the vehicle type and the build date were important legal distinctions. March 23 was just nine days before fuel tank guard frames and greater access to emergency exits and a number of other improved safety standards, notably better clear space access to rear emergency exits, were required by revised federal regulations on all school buses built for use in the U.S. with beginning production dates of the chassis on or after April 1 of that year.

The completed bus was delivered in time for use during the 1977-78 school year, and served ten years in use as a school bus. Radcliff Assembly of God acquired the used [[school bus]] as surplus from the [[Meade County, Kentucky|Meade County]] school district, and it had been owned by the church for about one year. In use with the church, the bus had successfully made the same round-trip to Kings Island in July 1987, was used daily for short local moves on school days, and had made several other long trips. It was checked over regularly by mechanically-inclined church members, including a civilian motor pool supervisor from nearby [[Fort Knox]]. Two new tires of a good commercial quality had been installed a week before the ill-fated trip, and front end suspension and steering parts examined at that time. By all indications, the bus was in good condition mechanically on May 14, 1988.

===Trip===

On the trip, the bus was driven by John Pearman, a part-time associate [[pastor]] of the church who was a local court clerk. The group left the church early that morning and traveled uneventfully to the park. They spent the whole day and early evening at Kings Island, then boarded the bus and began traveling out of Ohio and back into [[Northern Kentucky]] toward Radcliff. After about an hour, they stopped to fill the 60-gallon (227-litre) [[fuel tank]] with [[gasoline]], then resumed the trip southward.

====Collision====
At 10:55&amp;nbsp;p.m., while heading south on [[Interstate 71]] outside of [[Carrollton, Kentucky]], the bus collided almost head-on with a black [[Toyota Hilux|Toyota pickup truck]] which was traveling the wrong way (north in the southbound lanes) at a high speed on a curved stretch of the highway. The small truck was driven by Larry Wayne Mahoney, a 34-year-old factory worker who was [[driving under the influence|intoxicated]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Larry Copeland, @ByLarryCopeland, USA TODAY |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/05/12/survivors-recall-deadliest-drunken-driving-crash/2154291/ |title=Survivors recall deadliest drunken-driving crash |publisher=Usatoday.com |date= |accessdate=2018-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The right front of the pickup truck struck the right front of the bus, breaking off the bus's suspension and driving the leaf spring backward into the gas tank mounted behind an exterior panel but outside the heavier frame, just behind the step well for the front door rendering the door inoperative. Leaking gasoline from the punctured fuel tank was ignited by sparks caused from metal parts of the suspension scraping along the road. As the seat covers and the highly flammable polyurethane foam padding ignited, the temperature inside the bus rose to an estimated 2,000 degrees and a thick cloud of noxious smoke enveloped the area from the ceiling down to seat level within a minute or two creating unsurvivable flash fire conditions.

===Evacuation difficulties===

Nobody aboard the bus was seriously injured by the actual collision between the two vehicles (though both vehicle drivers sustained injuries). However, the impact of the collision created a secondary situation, as the right front suspension of the Ford chassis broke off through the bus stepwell, puncturing the gasoline fuel tank and igniting the fuel supply. To quickly evacuate the bus in smoke and darkness, all 67 individuals could only use a single designated point of exit: the rear emergency door. In total, 26 passengers and the bus driver died, 34 passengers were injured, and 6 passengers escaped the bus without serious injury. Larry Mahoney, the driver of the Toyota pickup, sustained injuries from the collision.

Almost all of the occupants of the bus began trying to exit through the single rear emergency door. Exceptions were the driver, one [[chaperone (social)|chaperone]] who was said by many survivors to have tried to douse the flames with the fire extinguisher of the bus, and another chaperone, a small-bodied woman who managed to squeeze out a {{convert|9|x|24|in|cm|abbr=on}} window opening on the left side immediately adjacent to her seating position near the front. Of the four adults aboard the bus, she was the only survivor. Attempts by some of the other passengers to break or kick out any of the split-sash type side windows were unsuccessful.

According to the NTSB investigation, more than 60 persons trying to reach the only available exit—the rear emergency door—created a crush of bodies in the {{convert|12|in|cm}} aisle. Many passengers found themselves unable to move. A beverage cooler which had been earlier placed in the aisle near row 10 (of 11 rows of seats) further exacerbated this problem.

Passersby and some of the escaped passengers helped to extract immobilized children through the rear door, and help them to ground level about {{convert|3|ft|m|abbr=on}} below. Soon the entire interior of the bus flashed over, ultimately burning the trapped 27 people remaining aboard. At that point, no more passengers were accessible from outside the bus. Emergency vehicles had not yet arrived.

===Post-collision===
When fire first broke out immediately after the collision, bus driver John Pearman tried to put it out with a small [[fire extinguisher]] while passengers began to evacuate through the center rear emergency door, squeezing through the narrow opening between the two rear seats and jumping approximately 3 feet to the ground. The front door was blocked by collision damage, and there were no emergency exit windows or roof hatches, as found on commercial buses and some school buses of the time. Only one adult, a woman who was of small stature, managed to escape through a nine-inch opening side window. When she looked back up from the ground, the window opening was filled with flames. The other three adults aboard, including Pearman, died.

Survivors stated that after emptying the small fire extinguisher, Pearman helped some of the many children find their way down the narrow and dark aisle to the only practical way out of the smoke-filled bus. Several older boys attempted to kick out side windows without success. A pileup of passengers formed in and adjacent to the twelve inch aisle leading to the rear door, which was partially blocked by seat backs from the last row and a cooler stored in the aisle near row 10.

Many of those who made it to the area adjacent to the rear door were wedged in so tightly that passersby had to help pull children out from the human jam at the rear emergency door by force. However, within four minutes or less, the entire bus was on fire, and soon the exodus of passengers stopped. At that point, the passersby who had stopped to help could not reach those still aboard due to the raging fire, and turned their efforts to tending to the crowd of 40 mostly injured survivors.

===Emergency response===

After fire, rescue, and [[Kentucky State Police]] troopers responded to the scene, treated and transported survivors, and extinguished the fire, a crane was used to load the bus onto a flatbed truck that transported the bus and those persons killed to the [[United States National Guard|National Guard]] Armory in Carrollton. There, the KSP and the Carroll County coroner went through the interior of the bus seat by seat to find and remove bodies. Most of the bodies were burned beyond recognition. Many bodies were found facing the only exit, the rear door. The coroner later determined that none of the bus occupants suffered broken bones or mortal injuries from the crash impact; all had died from the fire and smoke.

Among the bus survivors, one person's leg from just below the knee had to be amputated, and about ten others suffered disfiguring burns. Only 6 bus passengers were uninjured and virtually all suffered varying degrees of emotional trauma and [[survivor guilt]] syndrome. When authorities were able to tally the counts from the various hospitals and the bodies aboard the bus, and autopsies had been conducted, it was determined that 27 persons had been killed by the fire, and another 34 aboard the bus injured, as well as the pickup truck driver who was also injured. As of February 2010, this collision had the highest death and injury toll of any school bus crash in United States history; [[Prestonsburg, Kentucky, bus disaster|a crash near Prestonsburg, Kentucky]] in 1958 also claimed 27 lives, but there were not as many additional injuries.

==Aftermath==
===NTSB report===

The [[National Transportation Safety Board]] responded, conducted an investigation and issued a report on March 28, 1989.

{{quote|About 10:55 p.m. [[Eastern Daylight Time|EDT]] on May 14, 1988, a pickup truck traveling northbound in the southbound lanes of Interstate 71 struck head-on a church activity bus traveling southbound in the left lane of the highway near Carrollton, Kentucky. As the pickup truck rotated during impact, it struck a passenger car traveling southbound in the right lane near the church bus. The church bus fuel tank was punctured during the collision sequence, and a fire ensued, engulfing the entire bus. The bus driver and 26 bus passengers were fatally injured. Thirty-four bus passengers sustained minor to critical injuries, and six bus passengers were not injured. The pickup truck driver sustained serious injuries, but neither occupant of the passenger car was injured.}}

The NTSB determined that "the probable cause of the collision between the pickup truck and the church activity bus was the alcohol-impaired condition of the pickup truck driver who operated his vehicle opposite to the direction of traffic flow on an interstate highway."

===School bus and church bus standards and regulations===
A contributing factor to the crash itself and the severity seemed to be loopholes between the laws and procedures for a [[school bus]] and those involving the same vehicle after it was released from school service, but continued to be used for transporting passengers in non-school use. (Had the bus been built new in March 1977 for the non-school use such as a church activity bus, the applicable federal motor vehicle standards in place at that time would have required it to have been built with more emergency exits than were required for school buses). One of the NTSB recommendations after the Carrollton Bus Disaster was that school buses have no fewer emergency exits than required of non-school buses.

Some states also require that the usually different seating capacities for children and adults be displayed near the service door of school buses and non-school buses. Most states consider secondary school (middle and high school) age students to be adults with regards to the space occupied in bus seats and aisles by their bodies.

===Sentencing of Larry Mahoney===

Mahoney had been arrested for [[DUI]] once before. His [[blood alcohol concentration]] (BAC) the night of the crash was .24 percent—substantially more than the 1988 Kentucky legal limit of .10. Mahoney had no memory of the crash and learned of the collision after waking in the hospital the next day.

He was sentenced to imprisonment for 16 years after a jury of the [[Kentucky Circuit Courts|Carroll Circuit Court]], under Indictment No. 88-CR-27, convicted him of 27 counts of [[manslaughter]] in the second degree, 16 counts of assault in the second degree, and 27 counts of wanton endangerment in the first degree.&lt;ref name="DDLO"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.enquirer.com/editions/2003/05/14/loc_mahoney.html | title=Drunken driver lives in obscurity | publisher=The Cincinnati Enquirer | date=May 14, 2003 | accessdate=March 30, 2014 | author=Crowley, Patrick | archive-url=https://archive.today/20130122151127/http://www.enquirer.com/editions/2003/05/14/loc_mahoney.html# | archive-date=January 22, 2013 | dead-url=bot: unknown | df=mdy-all }}()&lt;/ref&gt; At trial, he was represented by the Cleveland, Ohio criminal defense lawyer, [[William L. Summers]]. On appeal, in Case No. 1988-CA-1635, Judge Anthony M. Wilhoit of the [[Kentucky Court of Appeals]] reversed Mahoney's conviction for drunk driving on the grounds that it constituted [[double jeopardy]] under the [[Kentucky Constitution]], ruling that the 27 counts of manslaughter in the second degree subsumed the drunk driving conviction. The court ruled that, under Kentucky law, the elements of drunk driving were substantially similar to those of manslaughter. This meant that Mahoney's driver's license could be reinstated, even during his imprisonment. The [[Kentucky Supreme Court]] subsequently reversed this line of reasoning in another case, ''Justice v. Commonwealth'', 987 S.W.2d 306 (Ky. December 17, 1998). On May 6, 1992, the Kentucky Supreme Court denied review of Mahoney's appeal in Case No. 1992-SC-98.

At the [[Kentucky State Reformatory]], Mahoney worked in the medium-security facility as a [[janitor]]. He earned his [[GED]] [[high school]] equivalency [[diploma]] and participated in [[Alcoholics Anonymous]] and [[Narcotics Anonymous]] programs. Described by authorities as a model prisoner, Mahoney reduced his incarceration by six years with good behavior, known under Kentucky law as "good time" credit. He declined the Kentucky Parole Board's parole recommendation and served out his sentence, before leaving the prison in [[La Grange, Kentucky|La Grange]], on September 1, 1999, having served 10 years and 11 months. Local television stations broadcast video of him walking out of the prison.

That week, according to a published account in ''[[The Courier-Journal]]'' (Louisville), some survivors of the crash and families of the victims had said that they were willing to forgive Mahoney though the disaster marked forever the congregation of the First Assembly of God, which had many members on the bus.  "I feel a little bit sorry for him", Katrina Henderson, then 23, told ''The Courier-Journal'' in 1998. "He didn't wake up one day and say 'I'm going to kill 27 people.' That's not to take any blame away from him. I think that he is a person who made some very bad choices and he paid for those choices", said Henderson, who was age 12 when she survived the wreck. The victims were members of a church, and many felt called by their religious beliefs to forgive him.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

During his trial, the idea was discussed that Mahoney could save lives by talking to school groups, but Mahoney has so far declined.

According to a story by ''[[The Cincinnati Enquirer]]'' in 2003, Mahoney was living in quiet, self-imposed obscurity in rural [[Owen County, Kentucky]], about {{convert|10|mi|km|spell=in}} from the crash site.&lt;ref name="DDLO"/&gt;

===MADD and drunk driving prevention===

The collision riveted the nation's attention on the problem of drunken driving as never before and has been credited in part with causing the steady decline in the number of alcohol-related fatalities.

One of the victims, the youngest killed on the fatal bus, was ten-year-old Patricia "Patty" Susan Nunnallee. Patty's mother, [[Karolyn Nunnallee]] became an active member of [[Mothers Against Drunk Driving|MADD]] after the crash, eventually becoming MADD's national president. Patty's mother wrote on MADD's memorial web page to Patty: ''They were traveling on a school bus, so I thought she'd be safe''.

Janey Fair, whose 14-year-old daughter Shannon was killed, become a national volunteer for MADD, and rose within the organization to become a member of the Board of Directors. She was also head of the Kentucky Victims Coalition. According to the MADD website, "MADD helped me find my inner strength and see that life could go on," Janey said. "I have found I can make real changes in people's attitudes about drinking and driving and in how our government addresses this critical problem. Additionally, I can help other victims move forward in their lives." Her husband also became active locally in MADD.

Joy Williams, wife of Lee Williams, a pastor of the church, and their two young daughters, Kristen and Robin, were among those killed. Dotty Pearman's husband, John Pearman was associate pastor at the church and the bus driver, was also killed while their daughter, Christy, was involved in the crash and survived.

In the year after the crash, Lee Williams and Dotty Pearman, who barely knew each other before the crash, became friends and eventually married.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.corydondemocrat.com/Articles-i-2002-12-25-39145.231111-14-years-later-Carrollton-bus-crash-still-vivid.html | title=14 years later, Carrollton bus crash still vivid | publisher=The Corydon Democrat | date=December 25, 2002 | accessdate=March 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lee and Dotty Williams also volunteer for MADD. Lee is a former chapter president of MADD in [[Hardin County, Kentucky]], and Dotty is the current president. The couple often speaks to school groups, assists with health fairs and participates in other local events. "If I can persuade one person not to drink and drive, I've won", said Dotty. "I especially think it is important to educate children early on about the dangers of drinking and driving. We need to address the issue of alcohol with youth before it becomes a problem."

===Changes in Kentucky===
Kentucky now requires all school buses to have nine emergency exits—more than any other federal or state standard. This includes front and back doors, a side door, four emergency windows and two roof exits. The bus that crashed at Carrollton had only front and back exits, and 11 rows of 39" seats, including the crucial area near the rear door.

Buses used by Kentucky schools must also have a cage around the fuel tank, a stronger frame and roof to resist crumpling on impact and rollover, high-backed seats, extra seat padding, a fuel system that slows leaks, flame-retardant seats and floors, reflective tape on all emergency exits, an 8" wide black band with the district name in white letters on the side, and strobe lights on the exterior. Schools also must have a [[diesel engine|diesel]]-powered fleet. (Unlike gasoline, diesel fuel is not highly [[flammable]].)

In 1991, Kentucky enacted stricter drunk driving laws.

===Memorials===
Ford Motor Company paid for a black marble memorial in North Hardin Memorial Gardens Cemetery in Radcliff, Kentucky. The stone lists the names of all of the persons who were aboard the bus during the crash.

The Kentucky Department of Transportation has 2 small signs, 1 in each direction of I-71, reading "SITE OF FATAL BUS CRASH MAY 14, 1988" at the site of the crash. There has been some controversy over the signs.&lt;ref name=DDLO/&gt;

==Media coverage==
Among the many media agencies that provided thorough coverage, ''[[The Courier-Journal]]'' of [[Louisville, Kentucky]] received the [[1989 Pulitzer Prize|1989]] [[Pulitzer Prize for Breaking News Reporting|Pulitzer Prize for General News Reporting]] for its coverage.

Following the NTSB report, and much sooner in many instances, many federal, state, and local agencies and bus manufacturers changed regulations, vehicle features, and operating practices.

[[Mothers Against Drunk Driving]], a [[grassroots]] organization, worked both before and after the Carrollton crash to reduce the hazards created by drunk (or drinking) drivers. Two mothers of Carrollton victims became national president and vice president of the organization.

There was considerable [[civil litigation]]. [[Ford Motor Company]], [[Sheller-Globe Corporation]], and others eventually contributed to settlements with all victims and/or their families.

The collision and its aftermath, including efforts of some of the families to obtain more than financial settlements, were chronicled by author James S. Kunen in his 1994 book ''Reckless Disregard: Corporate Greed, Government Indifference, and the Kentucky School Bus Crash''.

The Carrollton bus crash is the subject of the 2013 documentary film ''Impact After the Crash''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2076229/ | title=Impact After the Crash | publisher=IMDb | accessdate=March 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Catherine de' Medici's patronage of the arts''' made a significant contribution to the [[French Renaissance]]. [[Catherine de' Medici|Catherine]] was inspired by the example of her father-in-law, [[Francis I of France|King Francis I of France]] (reigned 1515–1547), who had hosted the leading artists of Europe at his court. As a young woman, she witnessed at first hand the artistic flowering stimulated by his patronage.&lt;ref name =K244&gt;Knecht, 244.&lt;/ref&gt; As governor and [[regent]] of France, Catherine set out to imitate Francis's politics of magnificence. In an age of civil war and declining respect for the monarchy, she sought to bolster royal prestige through lavish cultural display.

After the death of her husband, [[Henry II of France|Henry II]], in 1559,  Catherine governed France on behalf of her young sons [[Francis II of France|King Francis II]] (1559–60) and [[Charles IX of France|King Charles IX]] (1560–74). Once in control of the royal purse, she launched a program of artistic patronage which lasted for three decades. She continued to employ Italian artists and performers, including the artist-architect [[Primaticcio]]. By the 1560s, however, a wave of home-grown talent—trained and influenced by the foreign masters brought to France by Francis—came to the fore. Catherine patronised these new artists and presided over a distinctive late French-Renaissance culture. New forms emerged in literature, architecture, and the performing arts.&lt;ref&gt;Knecht, 220.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, as art historian Alexandra Zvereva suggests, Catherine became one of the great art collectors of the [[Renaissance]].&lt;ref name = z6&gt;Zvereva, 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Catherine spent ruinous sums on the arts, the majority of her patronage had no lasting effect. The end of the Valois dynasty shortly after her death brought a change in priorities. Her collections were dispersed, her palaces sold, and her [[Catherine de' Medici's building projects|buildings]] were left unfinished or later destroyed. Where Catherine had made her mark was in the magnificence and originality of her famous [[Catherine de' Medici's court festivals|court festivals]]. Today's ballets and operas are distantly related to Catherine de' Medici's court productions.&lt;ref&gt;Knecht, 245.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Visual arts==

An inventory drawn up at the [[Hôtel de la Reine]] after [[Catherine de' Medici]]'s death shows that she was a keen collector of art and curiosities. Works of art included [[tapestries]], hand-drawn maps, sculptures, and hundreds of pictures, many by Côme Dumoûtier and [[Benjamin Foulon]], Catherine's last official painters. There were rich fabrics, [[ebony]] furniture inlaid with [[ivory]], sets of china (probably from [[Bernard Palissy]]'s workshop), and [[Limoges]] pottery. Curiosities included fans, dolls, caskets, games, pious objects, a stuffed [[chameleon]], and seven stuffed crocodiles.&lt;ref&gt;Knecht, 240–41.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the time of Catherine's death in 1589, the Valois dynasty was in a terminal crisis; it became extinct with the death of Henry III only a few months later. Catherine's properties and belongings were sold off to pay her debts and dispersed with little ceremony. She had hoped for a far different posterity. In 1569, the [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] ambassador had identified her with her [[House of Medici|Medici]] forebears: "One recognises in the queen the spirit of her family. She wishes to leave a legacy behind her: buildings, libraries, collections of antiquities".&lt;ref name = z6&gt;Zvereva, 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the destruction, loss, and fragmentation of Catherine's heritage, a collection of portraits formerly in her possession has been assembled at the [[Château de Chantilly|Musée Condé, Château de Chantilly]].

===Portraits===

[[File:Margot 001.jpg|thumb| Catherine's daughter [[Marguerite de Valois]], by [[François Clouet]], c. 1560]]

The vogue for portrait drawings intensified during Catherine de' Medici's life, and she may have regarded part of her collection as the equivalent of today's family photograph album. Catherine loved having her children painted: "I would like", she wrote in 1547 to her children's governor, Jean d'Humières, "to have paintings of all the children done . . . and sent to me, without delay, as soon as they are finished".&lt;ref&gt;Frieda, 109.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the more formal pictures include a high proportion of portraits of European kings and queens, past and present, most of which she probably commissioned personally.&lt;ref&gt;Dimier, 195. The similarity in sizes suggests that they were ordered to her specifications.&lt;/ref&gt; On 3 July 1571, Catherine wrote to Monsieur de la Mothe-Fénelon, ambassador in London, discussing the work of [[François Clouet]] and requesting a portrait of [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth]]. Catherine gave detailed instructions: "I pray you do me the pleasure that I may soon have a painting of the queen of England of small volume, in great [''de la grandeur''], and that it be well portrayed and done in the same fashion as the one sent be by the earl of Leicester, and ask, as I already have one in full face, it would be better to have her turning to the right."&lt;ref&gt;Jollet, 50: [https://archive.org/stream/correspondancedi00feneuoft#page/229/mode/1up ''Correspondance Diplomatique De Bertrand De Salignac De La Mothe Fenelon'', vol. 6, (1840), 229-231, 3 July 1571]&lt;/ref&gt;
The large group of portraits from Catherine's collection, now at the [[Château de Chantilly|Musée Condé, Château de Chantilly]], reveals her passion for the genre.&lt;ref&gt;See Zvereva, ''Les Clouet de Catherine de Médicis'', 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; These include portraits by [[Jean Clouet]] (1480–1541) and by his son François Clouet (c. 1510–1572). Jean drew and painted in the style of the Italian High Renaissance, but in the portraits of François, a northern-European [[naturalism (arts)|naturalism]] is apparent, and a flatter, more meticulous technique.&lt;ref&gt;Blunt, 73.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Anjou 1570louvre.jpg|thumb |left| Catherine's son [[Henry III of France|Henry, duke of Anjou]], by [[Jean Decourt]], c. 1573. The contemporary writer [[Jean Papire Masson]] passed on the story that as [[Charles IX of France|Charles IX]] was dying, he asked for this portrait to be brought from the artist's studio, in order to say goodbye to his brother, who was then in Poland.&lt;ref&gt;Dimier, 239.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

François Clouet drew and painted portraits of all Catherine's family as well as of many members of the court. His drawing has been called profound, owing to its accuracy and harmony of form and its psychological penetration.&lt;ref&gt;Dimier, 205–6.&lt;/ref&gt; This tradition of court portraiture was carried on by [[Jean Decourt]], Étienne, Côme, and Pierre Dumoûtier, and by the less polished [[Benjamin Foulon]] (François Clouet's nephew) and [[François Quesnel]]. The last two artists, plus another known as ''"Anonyme Lécurieux"'', tended to use a more stylised technique, producing flatter portraits, with less three-dimensional modelling.&lt;ref&gt;Blunt, 100; Jollet, 249–52.&lt;/ref&gt; After the death of Catherine de' Medici, a decline in the quality of portraiture set in; and by 1610, the native school patronised by the late Valois court and brought to its pinnacle by François Clouet had all but died out, and the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] became reliant on foreign artists.&lt;ref&gt;Dimier, 308–19; Jollet, 17–18. Technically, François Clouet's origins were [[Flemish people|Flemish]], since his father had arrived in Paris from Flanders prior to 1528; but François lived almost all of his life in France&lt;/ref&gt;

===Painting===

[[File:Caron-Antoine-triumph-of-winter.jpg| thumb| ''Triumph of Winter'', by [[Antoine Caron]], c. 1568.]]

Little is known about the painting at Catherine de' Medici's court.&lt;ref&gt;"There are few periods at which French painting was at a lower ebb than in the last quarter of the sixteenth century and the first quarter of the seventeenth, and few periods about which we are more ignorant." Blunt, 98.&lt;/ref&gt; In the last two decades of Catherine's life, only two painters stand out as recognisable personalities, [[Antoine Caron]] and [[Jean Cousin the Younger]]. The majority of paintings and portrait drawings that have survived from the late Valois period remain difficult or impossible to attribute to particular artists.

Antoine Caron became painter to Catherine de' Medici after working at [[Fontainebleau]] under [[Primaticcio]]. His vivid [[Mannerist]] style, with its love of ceremonial and [[allegory]],  perhaps reflects the peculiarly neurotic atmosphere of the French court during the [[French Wars of Religion|Wars of Religion]].&lt;ref&gt;Blunt calls Caron's style "perhaps the purest known type of Mannerism in its elegant form, appropriate to an exquisite but neurotic society". Blunt, 98, 100.&lt;/ref&gt; He adopted from [[Niccolò dell'Abbate]] the technique of elongated and twisted figures, placing them in spaces dominated by fantastical fragments of architecture borrowed from the drawings of [[Androuet du Cerceau|Jacques Androuet du Cerceau]] and painted in surprising rainbow contrasts. The effect makes Caron's pin-headed figures appear puny and lost in the landscapes.&lt;ref name = B100&gt;Blunt, 100.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of Caron's paintings, such as those of the ''Triumphs of the Seasons'', are of [[allegory|allegorical]] subjects that echo the festivities for which Catherine's court was famous. His designs for the [[Valois Tapestries]] depict the ''fêtes'', picnics, and mock battles of the "magnificent" entertainments for which Catherine was famous.&lt;ref name = "biic"&gt;Blunt, 98.&lt;/ref&gt; Caron often painted scenes of massacres, reflecting the background of civil war that cast a shadow over the magnificence of the court. Caron also painted [[astrology|astrological]] and [[prophecy|prophetical]] subjects, such as ''Astrologers Studying an Eclipse'' and '' Augustus and the Sibyl''. This theme may have been inspired by Catherine de' Medici's obsession with horoscopes and predictions.&lt;ref name = B100&gt;Blunt, 100.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The Last Judgement. Jean Cousin..jpg| thumb| left|''The Last Judgement.'' by [[Jean Cousin the Younger]].]]

Jean Cousin, to judge by contemporary praise for his work, may have been as highly regarded at the time as Caron. The royal accounts show large payments made to Cousin: he was among those who decorated Paris for the entry of [[Henry II of France|Henry II as king]]. Little of his work, however, survives. His most important surviving work is ''The Last Judgement'' in the [[Louvre]], which like Caron's art, depicts human beings dwarfed by the landscape and, in Blunt's words, "made to swarm over the earth like worms".&lt;ref name = B100&gt;Blunt, 100.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tapestries===

{{main| Valois tapestries}}

Missing from the inventory drawn up after Catherine's death were the eight huge tapestries, known as the [[Valois tapestries]], now held at the [[Uffizi]] gallery in Florence, which depict "[[magnificences]]" such as those at Bayonne in 1565 during the summit meeting between the French and Spanish courts and the ball laid on at the [[Tuileries]] palace in 1573 by Catherine for the Polish envoys who offered the crown of their country to her son [[Henry III of France|Henry of Anjou]].&lt;ref name =K2423&gt;Knecht, 242–43.&lt;/ref&gt;  These magnificent hangings, originally designed during the reign of [[Charles IX of France|King Charles IX]] by [[Antoine Caron]] in the early 1570s,&lt;ref&gt;Dimier, 190. Caron was also responsible for a series of [[cartoons]] for tapestries on the theme of [[Artemisia II of Caria|Artemisia]], in honour of Catherine de' Medici.&lt;/ref&gt; were woven later in the [[Spanish Netherlands]] with additions, possibly designed by [[Lucas de Heere]],&lt;ref&gt;See ''The Valois Tapestries'' (1959), by [[Frances Yates]], who proposed de Heere as the designer of the additions.&lt;/ref&gt; who worked for Catherine between 1559 and 1565,&lt;ref&gt;Dimier, 216. The information about de Heere comes from [[Karel van Mander]] (1548–1606).&lt;/ref&gt; that show fashions as late as 1580 and depict Henry III as king rather than Charles IX.&lt;ref name =K2423&gt;Knecht, 242–43.&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian [[Frances Yates]] has suggested that these tapestries may have been produced in connection with the intervention of Catherine's son [[François, Duke of Anjou]], who was elected [[duke of Brabant]], in the Spanish Netherlands in 1580, in defiance of the Spanish administration. Anjou figures prominently in the tapestries. Catherine de’ Medici herself appears as a central figure in black in most of them.&lt;ref name=K242&gt;Knecht, 242.&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed that she gave them to her granddaughter [[Christina of Lorraine]] in advance of her wedding to [[Ferdinando I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany|Ferdinand de’ Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany]] in 1589.&lt;ref name=K242 /&gt; The tapestries glorify the house of Valois by celebrating its magnificent festivals.&lt;ref name =K244&gt;Knecht, 244.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sculpture==

According to the contemporary art historian [[Vasari]], Catherine wanted [[Michelangelo]] to make her husband Henry II's [[equestrian statue]]; but Michelangelo passed the commission on to [[Daniele da Volterra]], and only the horse was ever made.&lt;ref&gt;Blunt, 282; Knecht, 225. Da Volterra died in 1566. The horse did not reach France until the seventeenth century, when it was utilised for an equestrian statue of [[Louis XIII of France|Louis XIII]]. It was melted down during the [[French revolution]].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Monument du coeur d'Henri II.jpg|thumb|left| Monument containing the heart of [[Henry II of France]], by [[Germain Pilon]] and [[Domenico del Barbieri|Domenico del Barbiere]].]]

On commission from Catherine, [[Germain Pilon]] carved the marble sculpture that contains Henry II's heart. The Florentine [[Domenico del Barbieri|Domenico del Barbiere]], who had worked at Fontainebleau, carved the base. Pilon's fluid style echoes Primaticcio's stucco work at Fontainebleau. The piece may also have been influenced by [[Pierre Bontemps]]'s monument for the heart of Francis I.&lt;ref name = "bxivc"&gt;Blunt, 94.&lt;/ref&gt; Pilon set the bronze urn on the heads of the [[Charites|Three Graces]], who are poised back to back, as if to dance.&lt;ref&gt;Hoogvliet, 110.&lt;/ref&gt; He may have based the design on that for an incense burner for Francis I, engraved by [[Marcantonio Raimondi|Marcantonio]]. Pilon's figures, however, with their long necks and small heads, are more like nymphs.&lt;ref name = "bxivc"&gt;Blunt, 94.&lt;/ref&gt; A poem by Ronsard is engraved at the foot of the sculpture. It asks the reader not to wonder that so small a vase can hold so large a heart, since Henry's real heart resides in Catherine's breast.&lt;ref&gt;Hoogvliet, 111. Ronsard may refer to [[Artemisia II of Caria|Artemisia]], who drank the ashes of her dead husband, which fused with her own body.&lt;/ref&gt; Henri Zerner has called the monument, which can be seen at the [[Louvre]], "one of the summits of our sculpture".&lt;ref&gt;Knecht, 225, quotes Henri Zerner, ''L’art de la Renaissance en France. L'invention du classicisme'', Paris: Flammarion, 1996, 354. The urn is a nineteenth-century restoration.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1580s, Pilon began work on statues for the chapels that were to circle the tomb of Catherine de' Medici and Henry II at the [[Basilique Saint-Denis|basilica of Saint Denis]]. Among these, the fragmentary ''Resurrection'', now in the Louvre, was designed to face the tomb of Catherine and Henry from a side chapel.&lt;ref&gt;Zerner, 383. Whereas the ''Resurrection'' for the tomb of Francis I had been positioned close to the corpses, this design would have involved the visitor.&lt;/ref&gt; This work owes a clear debt to [[Michelangelo Buonarroti|Michelangelo]], who had designed the tomb and funerary statues for Catherine's father at the [[Basilica of San Lorenzo, Florence|Medici chapels]] in Florence.&lt;ref&gt;Blunt, 95. Pilon based the Christ on [[Michelangelo Buonarroti|Michelangelo's]] cartoon for ''Noli me tangere'' (1531) and carved the soldiers in Michelangelo's ''[[contrapposto]]'' style.&lt;/ref&gt; Pilon openly depicted extreme emotion in his work, sometimes to the point of the grotesque. His style has been interpreted as a reflection of a society torn by the conflict of the [[French Wars of Religion|French wars of religion]].&lt;ref&gt;Blunt, 96–97.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architecture==

{{main| Catherine de' Medici's building projects}}

[[File:Drawing of an enlarged project of 1578 to 1579 for the Tuileries, by Jacques Androuet du Cerceau.jpg| thumb| Drawing by [[Androuet du Cerceau|Jacques Androuet du Cerceau]] of an enlarged project of 1578–1579 for the Tuileries, with oval halls]]

Architecture was Catherine de' Medici's first love among the arts.  "As the daughter of the Medici", suggests French art historian Jean-Pierre Babelon, "she was driven by a passion to build and a desire to leave great achievements behind her when she died."&lt;ref&gt;Babelon, 263.&lt;/ref&gt; Having witnessed in her youth the huge architectural schemes of [[Francis I of France|Francis I]] at [[Château de Chambord|Chambord]] and [[Château de Fontainebleau|Fontainebleau]], Catherine set out, after [[Henry II of France|Henry II's]] death, to enhance the grandeur of the [[House of Valois|Valois]] monarchy through a series of costly building projects.&lt;ref&gt;Frieda, 79, 455; Sutherland, ''Ancien Régime'', 6.&lt;/ref&gt; These included work on châteaux at Montceaux-en-Brie, [[Saint-Maur-des-Fossés]], and [[Château de Chenonceau|Chenonceau]], and the building of two new palaces in Paris: the [[Tuileries palace|Tuileries]] and the Hôtel de la Reine. Catherine was closely involved in the planning and supervising of all her architectural schemes.&lt;ref&gt;De l'Orme wrote that Catherine, with "an admirable understanding combined with great prudence and wisdom", took the trouble "to order the organization of her said palace [the Tuileries] as to the apartments and location of the halls, antechambers, chambers, closets and galleries, and to give the measurements of width and length". Quoted by Knecht, 228.&lt;/ref&gt; Architects of the day dedicated treatises to her in the sure knowledge that she would read them.&lt;ref&gt;Blunt, 91. For example, [[Androuet du Cerceau|Jacques Androuet du Cerceau]] dedicated his ''Les Plus Excellents Bastiments de France'' (1576 and 1579) to Catherine.&lt;/ref&gt; The poet [[Pierre de Ronsard|Ronsard]] accused her of preferring masons to poets.&lt;ref&gt;Knecht, 228.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Basilica di saint Denis tomba enrico II e caterina de' Medici 03.JPG| thumb| left| Effigies on the tomb of [[Henry II of France|Henry II]] and [[Catherine de' Medici]] at the [[Basilique Saint-Denis|basilica of Saint Denis]], carved by [[Germain Pilon]]&lt;ref&gt;Knecht, 227. Henry's gesture is now unclear, since a [[missal]], resting on a [[prie-dieu]] (prayer desk), was removed from the sculpture during the French revolution and melted down.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Catherine was intent on immortalising her sorrow at the death of her husband and had emblems of her love and grief carved into the stonework of her buildings.&lt;ref name="Knecht, 223"&gt;Knecht, 223.&lt;/ref&gt; As the centrepiece of an ambitious new chapel, she commissioned a magnificent tomb for Henry at the [[Basilique Saint-Denis|basilica of Saint Denis]], designed by 
[[Francesco Primaticcio]]. In a long poem of 1562, Nicolas Houël, laying stress on her love for architecture, likened Catherine to [[Artemisia II of Caria|Artemisia]], who had built the [[Mausoleum of Maussollos|Mausoleum]] at [[Halicarnassus]], one of the [[Seven Wonders of the Ancient World]], as a tomb for her dead husband.&lt;ref&gt;Frieda, 266; Hoogvliet, 108. Louis Le Roy, in his ''Ad illustrissimam reginam D. Catherinam Medicem'' of 1560, was the first to call Catherine the "new Artemisia".&lt;/ref&gt;
Primaticcio's circular plan for the Valois chapel, by allowing the tomb to be viewed from all angles, solved the problems faced by the Giusti brothers and [[Philibert de l'Orme]], builders of previous royal tombs.&lt;ref&gt;Blunt, 56.&lt;/ref&gt;  Art historian Henri Zerner has called the design "a grand ritualistic drama which would have filled the rotunda's celestial space" and "the last and most brilliant of the royal tombs of the Renaissance".&lt;ref&gt;''L’art de la Renaissance en France. L'invention du classicisme'' (Zerner, 1996: 349–54), quoted by Knecht, 227; Zerner, 379.&lt;/ref&gt; Work on the building was abandoned in 1585, as the monarchy faced bankruptcy and a series of rebellions. Over two hundred years later, in 1793, a mob tossed Catherine and Henry's bones into a pit with the rest of the French kings and queens.&lt;ref&gt;Knecht, 269.&lt;/ref&gt;

Catherine de' Medici spent extravagant sums on the building and embellishment of monuments and palaces, and as the country slipped deeper into anarchy, her plans grew ever more ambitious.&lt;ref&gt;Thomson, 168.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet the Valois monarchy was crippled by debt and its [[moral authority]] in steep decline. The popular view condemned Catherine's building schemes as obscenely wasteful. This was especially true in Paris, where the ''[[parlement]]'' was often asked to contribute to her costs.

[[Pierre de Ronsard|Ronsard]] captured the mood in a poem:

:''The queen must cease building,''
:''Her lime must stop swallowing our wealth…''
:''Painters, masons, engravers, stone-carvers''
:''Drain the treasury with their deceits.''
:''Of what use is her Tuileries to us?''
:''Of none, Moreau; it is but vanity.''
:''It will be deserted within a hundred years.''&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Knecht, 233. Ronsard addressed these lines to the financial official Raoul Moreau. ''Au tresorier de l'esparne'' (ca. 1573).&lt;/ref&gt;

Ronsard was in many ways proved correct. Little remains of Catherine de' Medici's investment today: one [[Doric order|Doric]] column, a few fragments in the corner of the [[Tuileries]] gardens, an empty tomb at Saint Denis.

==Literature==

[[File:Antoine Caron Astronomers Studying an Eclipse.jpg|thumb|''Astrologers Studying an Eclipse'', by [[Antoine Caron]]: Catherine was fascinated by [[astronomy]] and [[astrology]] and had a tower built, the Colonne de l'Horoscope, possibly used for observation of the stars.&lt;ref name="Knecht, 223"/&gt;]]

Catherine believed in the humanist ideal of the learned Renaissance prince whose power depended on letters as well as arms, and she was familiar with the writing of [[Desiderius Erasmus|Erasmus]], among others, on the subject.&lt;ref&gt;Hoogvliet, 109.&lt;/ref&gt; She enjoyed and collected books, and moved the royal collection to the [[Louvre]], her principal residence. She delighted in the company of learned men and women, and her court was highly literary. Her government officials, such as secretary-of-state [[Nicolas de Neufville, seigneur de Villeroy]], whose wife translated the epistles of [[Ovid]], were perfectly at home in literary circles.&lt;ref&gt;Sutherland, ''Secretaries of State'', 153–56.&lt;/ref&gt; When she could find the time, Catherine occasionally wrote verses herself, which she would show to the court poets.&lt;ref&gt;Heritier, 460.&lt;/ref&gt; Her reading was not entirely highbrow, however. A superstitious woman, she believed implicitly in astrology and [[Fortune-telling|soothsaying]], and her reading matter included ''The Book of Sibyls'' and the [[almanacs]] of [[Nostradamus]].&lt;ref&gt;Knecht, 221, 244–45&lt;/ref&gt;

Catherine patronised poets such as [[Pierre de Ronsard]], [[Rémy Belleau]], [[Jean-Antoine de Baïf]], and [[Jean Daurat|Jean Dorat]], who wrote verses, scripts, and associated literature for her court festivals, and for public events such as [[royal entries]] and royal weddings.&lt;ref&gt;Frieda, 105.&lt;/ref&gt; Catherine even had Ronsard write a poem to [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth of England]], honouring a new peace treaty.&lt;ref&gt;Heritier, 238–39.&lt;/ref&gt; These poets were part of a group sometimes known as the ''[[Pléiade]]'', who forged a vernacular French literature on Greek and Latin models. They gave form to their interest in ancient poetry in ''vers mesurés'', a metric system that aspired to imitate classical poetic rhythms. Catherine de' Medici was also interested in Italian literature: [[Torquato Tasso|Tasso]] presented his ''Rinaldo'' to her, and [[Pietro Aretino|Aretino]] [[eulogy|eulogised]] her as "woman and goddess serene and pure, the majesty of beings human and divine".&lt;ref name =K234&gt;Knecht, 234.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theatre==

In 1559, Catherine and Henry II attended a performance of the tragedy ''Sophonisba'' by [[Gian Giorgio Trissino|Trissino]], adapted earlier by the poet [[Mellin de Saint-Gelais]] to Catherine's commission.&lt;ref&gt;Plazenet, 261.&lt;/ref&gt; The performance style of the day inserted musical interludes unrelated to the plot between the acts, devoted to praise of the royal court. Princesses and other high-ranking ladies performed on this occasion, which celebrated royal and noble marriages.&lt;ref name =K234&gt;Knecht, 234.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pierre de Bourdeille, seigneur de Brantôme]], claimed in his memoirs that having seen ''Sophonisba'' shortly before her husband's death, Catherine refused to watch any more tragedies, believing the play had brought him bad luck. [[Tragedy]] went out of fashion at the court soon afterwards, replaced by the new genre of [[tragicomedy]], though the change in taste may have had less directly to do with Catherine than with the revulsion of the court against the violence of the times.&lt;ref name =K234&gt;Knecht, 234.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Genevra'', staged at [[Château de Fontainebleau|Fontainebleau]] on 13 February 1564, adapted into French from an episode of [[Ludovico Ariosto|Ariosto's]] ''[[Orlando Furioso]]'', was the first tragicomedy known to have been performed for the French court.&lt;ref name =K234&gt;Knecht, 234.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Commedia dell'arte - troupe Gelosi.JPG| thumb| [[I Gelosi]] performing ''[[commedia dell'arte]]'', perhaps featuring [[Isabella Andreini]], in the late sixteenth century]]

Catherine enjoyed comedy and ''[[wiktionary:risqué|risqué]]'' humour.  She drew the line at obscenity, however: in 1567, after seeing ''Le Brave'', an adaptation of [[Plautus| Plautus's]] ''[[Miles Gloriosus (play)|Miles Gloriosus]]'' by one of her official poets [[Jean-Antoine de Baïf]], Catherine told the author to cut the "lascivious talk" of the classical writers.&lt;ref&gt;Knecht, 235.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1570s, the Italian ''[[commedia dell'arte]]'' rose to popularity in France and became all the rage.&lt;ref&gt;Heller, 104.&lt;/ref&gt; Catherine was not, as has sometimes been supposed, the first to bring Italian comedy to France: [[Louis Gonzaga, Duke of Nevers]], himself an Italian, was the first to invite high-quality Italian players to France in 1571. The following year, two companies called [[I Gelosi]] appeared in Paris, and a performance was given to the court in [[Blois]]. A year later, I Gelosi performed during the celebrations for the marriage of Catherine's daughter [[Marguerite de Valois]] and [[Henry IV of France|Henry of Navarre]]. Further groups appeared under the same name in the reign of Catherine's son [[Henry III of France|Henry III]] (1574–89).

==Court festivals==
{{main| Catherine de' Medici's court festivals}}

As queen consort of France, Catherine patronised the arts and the theatre, but not until she attained real political and financial power as queen mother did she begin the series of [[Tournament (medieval)|tournaments]] and entertainments, sometimes called "magnificences", that dazzled her contemporaries and continue to fascinate scholars. The most famous of these were the court festivals mounted at [[Château de Fontainebleau|Fontainebleau]] and at [[Bayonne]] during [[Charles IX of France|Charles IX's]] royal progress of 1564–65; the entertainments for the Polish ambassadors at the [[Tuileries palace|Tuileries]] in 1573; and the celebrations following the marriages of Catherine's daughter [[Marguerite of Valois|Marguerite]] to [[Henry IV of France|Henry of Navarre]] in 1572 and of her daughter-in-law's sister, Marguerite of Lorraine, to [[Anne de Joyeuse|Anne, Duke of Joyeuse]], in 1581. On all these occasions, Catherine organised sequences of lavish and spectacular entertainments. Biographer Leonie Frieda suggests that "Catherine, more than anyone, inaugurated the fantastic entertainments for which later French monarchs also became renowned".&lt;ref name =FF&gt;Frieda, 225.&lt;/ref&gt;

For Catherine, these entertainments were worth their colossal expense, since they served a political purpose. Presiding over the royal government at a time when the French monarchy was in steep decline, she set out to show not only the French people but foreign courts that the Valois monarchy was as prestigious and magnificent as it had been during the reigns of [[Francis I of France|Francis I]] and her husband [[Henry II of France|Henry II]].&lt;ref name =St&gt;Strong, 99.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, she believed these elaborate entertainments and sumptuous court rituals, which incorporated martial sports and tournaments of many kinds, would occupy her feuding nobles and distract them from fighting against each other to the detriment of the country and the royal authority.&lt;ref&gt;Yates, 51–52.&lt;br /&gt;• Catherine wrote to Charles IX: "I heard it said to your grandfather the King that two things were necessary to live in peace with the French and have them love their King: keep them happy, and busy at some exercise, notably tournaments; for the French are accustomed, if there is no war, to exercise themselves and if they are not made to do so they employ themselves to more dangerous [ends]". Quoted in Jollet, 111.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is clear, however, that Catherine regarded these festivals as more than a political and pragmatic exercise; she revelled in them as a vehicle for her creative gifts. A highly talented and artistic woman, Catherine took the lead in devising and planning her own musical-mythological shows and is regarded as their creator as well as their sponsor. Historian Frances Yates has called her "a great creative artist in festivals".&lt;ref name="Yates, 68"&gt;Yates, 68.&lt;/ref&gt; Though they were [[ephemeral]], Catherine's "magnificences" are studied by modern scholars as works of art.&lt;ref name =FF&gt;Frieda, 225.&lt;/ref&gt; Catherine employed the leading writers, artists, and architects of the day, including [[Antoine Caron]], [[Germain Pilon]], and [[Pierre Ronsard]], to create the dramas, music, scenic effects, and decorative works required to animate the themes of the festivals, which were usually [[mythological]] and dedicated to the ideal of peace in the realm. It is difficult for scholars to reconstruct the exact form of Catherine's entertainments, but research into the written accounts, scripts, artworks, and [[tapestries]] that derived from these famous occasions has provided evidence of their richness and scale.

In the tradition of 16th-century royal festivals, Catherine de' Medici's magnificences took place over several days, with a different entertainment on each day. Often individual lords and ladies and members of the royal family were responsible for preparing one particular entertainment. Spectators and participants, including those involved in martial sports, would dress up in costumes representing mythological or romantic themes. Catherine gradually introduced changes to the traditional form of these entertainments. She forbade heavy [[jousting|tilting]] of the sort that led to the death of her husband in 1559; and she developed and increased the prominence of dance in the shows that climaxed each series of entertainments.

===Dance===

A distinctive new art form, the ''[[ballets de cour|ballet de cour]]'', emerged from the creative advances in court entertainment devised by Catherine de' Medici.&lt;ref&gt;Yates, 51; Strong, 102, 121–22.&lt;/ref&gt; The Italian influence on the ''ballet de cour'' owed much to Catherine, who was Italian herself and had grown up in [[Florence]], where ''[[intermedio|intermedii]]'', patronised by her rich relatives, were a staple of court entertainments and a focus of innovation. These between-acts entertainments had evolved a unique artistic form of their own, with choral dances, masquerades (''mascherate''), and consecutive themes.&lt;ref&gt;Shearman, 105.&lt;/ref&gt; Once in France, Catherine kept in touch with artistic innovations in Italy. She encouraged Italian dancing masters to accept posts in France, among them the Milanese [[Cesare Negri]], who introduced the skills of [[Dance figure|figured dancing]] to France, and Pompeo Diobono, whom Catherine employed as dancing master to her four sons.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, 39.&lt;/ref&gt; The most significant figure was [[Balthasar de Beaujoyeulx]] (his name gallicised from the Italian Baldassare da Belgiojoso), whom Catherine placed in charge of training dancers and producing performances at court.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, 40–42.&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian [[Frances Yates]] has credited Catherine as the guiding light of the ''ballets de cour'':
 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
It was invented in the context of the chivalrous pastimes of the court, by an Italian, and a Medici, the Queen Mother. Many poets, artists, musicians, choreographers, contributed to the result, but it was she who was the inventor, one might perhaps say, the producer; she who had the ladies of her court trained to perform these ballets in settings of her devising.&lt;ref name="Yates, 68"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Siren from Ballet Comique de la Reine.jpg|thumb|left| A [[Siren (mythology)|siren]] from the ''[[Ballet Comique de la Reine]]'', 1581]]

The dance performances at the [[House of Valois|Valois]] court were conceived on a large scale, as elaborate, choreographed showpieces, sometimes performed by considerable forces. At the Château of Fontainebleau in 1564, the court attended a ball in which 300 "beauties dressed in gold and silver cloth" performed a choreographed dance.&lt;ref&gt;Frieda, 211.&lt;/ref&gt; In his illustrated ''Magnificentissimi spectaculi'', [[Jean Daurat|Jean Dorat]] described an intricate ballet, ''The Ballet of the Provinces of France'', performed for the Polish ambassadors at the Tuileries palace in 1573, in which sixteen nymphs, each representing a French province, distributed devices to the spectators as they danced. Choreographed by Beaujoyeulx, the dancers performed complex, interlaced figures and patterned movements, each expressing a certain moral or spiritual truth that the spectators, assisted by printed programmes, were expected to recognise.&lt;ref name="Lee, 42"&gt;Lee, 42.&lt;/ref&gt; The chronicler [[Agrippa d'Aubigné]] recorded that the Poles marvelled at the ballet.&lt;ref name="Knecht, 239"&gt;Knecht, 239.&lt;/ref&gt; Brantôme called the performance "the finest ballet that was ever given in this world" and praised Catherine for bringing prestige to France with "all these inventions".&lt;ref name="Knecht, 239"/&gt; Jean Dorat described the movements of the dancers in verse:

:They blend a thousand flights with a thousand pauses of the feet
:Now they stitch through one another like bees by holding hands
:Now they form a point like a flock of voiceless cranes.
:Now they draw close, intertwining with one another
:Creating an entangled hedge like a kind of bramble bush.
:Now this one and now that switches to a flat figure
:Which describes many letters without a tablet.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Lee,  43.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the dance was over, Catherine invited the spectators to join  with the performers in a social dance.

[[File:Ballet 1582.png|thumb| The ''[[Ballet Comique de la Reine]]'', from an engraving of 1582]]

Over the years, Catherine increased the element of dance in her festive entertainments, and it became the norm for a major ballet to climax each series of magnificences. The ''[[Ballet Comique de la Reine]]'', devised under Catherine's influence, by [[Louise of Lorraine|Queen Louise]] for the Joyeuse Magnificences of 1581, is regarded by historians as the moment when the ''[[ballets de cour|ballet de cour]]'' assumed the character of a new art form. The theme of the entertainment was an invocation of cosmic forces to aid the monarchy, which at that time was threatened by the rebellion not only of Huguenots but of many Catholic nobles. Men were shown as reduced to beasts by [[Circe]], who held court in a garden at one end of the hall. Louise and her ladies, costumed as [[naiad]]s, entered on a chariot designed as a fountain and then danced a ballet of thirteen geometric figures. After being turned to stone by Circe, they were freed to dance a ballet of forty geometric figures. Four groups of dancers, each wearing a different-coloured costume, moved through a sequence of patterns, including squares, triangles, circles, and spirals.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, 45; Strong, 120–21.&lt;/ref&gt;

The figured choreography that enacted the mythological and symbolic themes reflected the principle, derived from the ''[[Enneads]]'' of [[Plotinus]] (c. 205–270), of "cosmic dance", the imitation of heavenly bodies by human motion to produce harmony. This imitation was achieved in the dance through geometric choreography and figures based on the harmony of numbers.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, 41–42.&lt;/ref&gt; The dance elements in the court festivities represented a response to the increasing political disharmony of the country.&lt;ref name="Lee, 42"/&gt; The ''Ballet Comique de la Reine'' marked the final transformation of court dance as a purely personal and social activity into a unified theatrical performance with a philosophical and political agenda.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, 41. See also [http://www.graner.net/nicolas/arbeau/ ''Orchésographie''] (1588) by [[Thoinot Arbeau]], the first publication to [[dance notation|notate]]—in relation to music—the steps taken from social dances.&lt;/ref&gt; Owing to its synthesis of dance, music, verse, and setting, the production is regarded by scholars as the first authentic ballet.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, 44.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music===

The dance, verse, and musical elements of Catherine's entertainments increasingly reflected the principles of an academic movement—also influential in the [[Florentine Camerata]]—to unify the performing arts in what was believed to be the classical, Greek way. In 1570, [[Jean-Antoine de Baïf]] founded the [[Académie de Poésie et de Musique]], whose aim was to revive ancient metrical practices, and, though the academy was short lived, similar aims were adopted by the ''Académie du Palais'', founded in 1577. Both enterprises were supported by the Valois court. One result of this movement was ''[[Musique mesurée| Musique mesurée à l'antique]]'', in which the metres of music and verse were matched precisely, to create a new harmony. The theory was not merely technical but [[Renaissance humanism|humanistic]]; practitioners believed a harmonious combination of elements would produce benign moral and ethical effects on the audience. Dance was also subject to the new system and was designed to match the rhythms of the music and verse. The result was a new unified approach to the interrelationship between the performing arts.&lt;ref&gt;Strong, 102.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Клод Лежен.jpg|right|thumb|[[Claude Le Jeune]], the leading composer of the day, wrote music for Catherine de' Medici's entertainments and for court ceremonies and religious occasions]]

The well-documented Joyeuse magnificences of 1581 provide the clearest evidence of the influence of this artistic movement on Catherine de' Medici's entertainments. The chief composer of music for the performances was [[Claude Le Jeune]] (1528–1600). His ''musique mesurée'' was played at the wedding itself, and his song "La Guerre" was sung during a foot-combat in the Louvre. He also wrote the music for an elaborate show on a sun-moon theme, once again setting ''vers mesurés'' to ''musique mesurée''.&lt;ref&gt;Strong, 118.&lt;/ref&gt; For the ''Ballet Comique de la Reine'', the music was composed by the Sieur de Beaulieu. The musicians were fully incorporated in the dramatic whole: on one side of the performing space was a cloud containing costumed singers and musicians, and on the other, a [[grotto]], guarded by [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]], containing a second band of musicians. Further groups of singers and musicians made various entries and exits during the five-and-a-half-hour performance. At one stage, [[Circe]] turned the dancers and musicians to stone.&lt;ref&gt;Strong, 119–20.&lt;/ref&gt; When, at the climax of the show, [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] descended from the heavens, forty singers and musicians performed a song in honour of the wisdom and virtue of the Valois monarchy.&lt;ref&gt;Strong, 121.&lt;/ref&gt; Published accounts praised the length and variety of the music. The Jupiter music was called the "most learned and excellent music that had ever been sung or heard".&lt;ref&gt;Knecht, 241.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''"Cold Sunday"''' was a [[meteorology|meteorological]] event which took place on January 17, 1982, when unprecedentedly cold air swept down from Canada and plunged temperatures across much of the United States far below existing all-time record lows.

The phenomenon was caused by an unusually strong [[High pressure area|high pressure system]] over [[Saskatchewan]] with a core pressure of 1055[[millibar|mb]] (31.15 inHg), a level rarely seen outside of permanent [[polar region|polar]] areas such as [[Siberia]] and Antarctica. A recent [[snow]]fall had left the ground without any way to hold on to its heat and temperatures dropped precipitously. This mass of cold air was so strong that the temperature at [[Mequon, Wisconsin]], dropped to &amp;minus;40&amp;nbsp;°F (&amp;minus;40&amp;nbsp;°C). The previous record was &amp;minus;28&amp;nbsp;°F (&amp;minus;33&amp;nbsp;°C) and temperatures below &amp;minus;20&amp;nbsp;°F (&amp;minus;29&amp;nbsp;°C) had been felt there only six times in the previous 100 years. The lowest temperature recorded that day in the United States was &amp;minus;52&amp;nbsp;°F (&amp;minus;47&amp;nbsp;°C), measured near [[Tower, Minnesota]].

Below is a partial list of cities which set all-time record low temperatures in the United States. This is only a small fraction of all locales setting record low temperatures: Hundreds of towns and cities from [[North Dakota]] to [[New Jersey]] to [[Mississippi]] broke records, and the vast majority of the records set on "Cold Sunday" still stand. The cold was not confined to the night, either. In [[Princeton, New Jersey]], and [[Cincinnati, Ohio]], the ''daytime high temperatures'' were 2&amp;nbsp;°F (&amp;minus;17&amp;nbsp;°C) and &amp;minus;9&amp;nbsp;°F (&amp;minus;23&amp;nbsp;°C). The average high temperature in January is 39&amp;nbsp;°F (4&amp;nbsp;°C) in both cities.

While much of [[South Florida]] escaped the deep freeze, enough damage was done to [[citrus crop]]s in [[Central Florida]] during the month of January  to write off the 1982 harvest as a disaster.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9199">'''Concealing a birth''' is the act of a parent (or other responsible person) failing to report the birth of a [[child]].  The term is sometimes used to refer to hiding the birth of a child from friends or family, but is most often used when the appropriate authorities have not been informed about a [[stillbirth]] or the death of a newborn.  This is a [[crime]] in many countries, with varying punishments.

==Australia==

'''Australian Capital Territory'''

==Canada==

Section 242 of the Canadian [[Criminal Code (Canada)|''Criminal Code'']] (injury to, or death of, a child due to its mother neglecting to obtain assistance in child birth with intent that it should not live or to conceal its birth).[http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/ShowDoc/cs/C-46/bo-ga:l_VIII::bo-ga:l_IX//en?page=6&amp;isPrinting=false#codese:242] (English) [http://laws.justice.gc.ca/fr/ShowDoc/cs/C-46/bo-ga:l_VIII::bo-ga:l_IX//fr?page=6&amp;isPrinting=false#codese:242] (French)

Section 243 of that Code (concealing the dead body of a child with intent to its conceal birth).
[http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/ShowDoc/cs/C-46/bo-ga:l_VIII::bo-ga:l_IX//en?page=6&amp;isPrinting=false#codese:243] (English) [http://laws.justice.gc.ca/fr/ShowDoc/cs/C-46/bo-ga:l_VIII::bo-ga:l_IX//fr?page=6&amp;isPrinting=false#codese:243] (French)

==China==
A birth could have been concealed when there was a violation of the country's previous [[one-child policy]] in the [[People's Republic of China]].

==England and Wales, and Northern Ireland==
In England and Wales, and in Northern Ireland, section 60 of the [[Offences against the Person Act 1861]] creates the offence of concealing the birth of a child:

{{quote|If any woman shall be delivered of a child, every person who shall, by any secret disposition of the dead body of the said child, whether such child died before, at, or after its birth, endeavour to conceal the birth thereof, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, and being convicted thereof shall be liable, at the discretion of the court, to be imprisoned for any term not exceeding two years, ... }}

The words "with or without [[penal labour|hard labour]]" omitted in the first place were repealed for England and Wales by section 1(2) of the [[Criminal Justice Act 1948]].

The proviso to this section, as extended by any subsequent enactment, was repealed for England and Wales by section 10 of, and [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1967/58/schedule/2/paragraph/13 paragraph 13(1)(a)] of Schedule 2 to, and [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1967/58/schedule/3/part/III Part III] of Schedule 3 to, the [[Criminal Law Act 1967]]. Originally, the proviso allowed the jury to find an [[alternative verdict]] of this offence on a charge of [[murder in English law|murder]]. In England and Wales, it was subsequently extended to allow the jury to find an alternative verdict of this offence on a charge of [[child destruction]]&lt;ref&gt;The [[Infant Life (Preservation) Act 1929]], [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo5/19-20/34/section/2/enacted section 2(4)]&lt;/ref&gt; or a charge of [[infanticide]].&lt;ref&gt;It was initially extended by the [[Infanticide Act 1922]] and then by [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo6/1-2/36/section/1/enacted section 1(4)] of the [[Infanticide Act 1938]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Section 60 of the Offences against the Person Act 1861 is framed on section 14 of the [[Offences against the Person Act 1828]] (which applied to England, including [[Wales and Berwick Act 1746|Wales and Berwick]]) and section 17 of the [[Offences against the Person (Ireland) Act 1829|10 Geo 4 c 34]], which applied to Ireland.&lt;ref name="Davis 1861"&gt;[[James Edward Davis]]. [[The Criminal Law Consolidation Statutes of the 24 &amp; 25 of Victoria, Chapters 94 to 100: Edited with Notes, Critical and Explanatory]]. Butterworths. 1861. [https://books.google.com/books?pg=PA279&amp;id=HMw0AAAAIAAJ&amp;output=html Page 279].&lt;/ref&gt; This offence was previously created by section 4 of the [[Lord Ellenborough's Act]] (43 Geo 3 c 58) (1803). This in turn replaced "An Act to prevent the Murthering of Bastard Children" (21 Jac 1 c 27) (1623)&lt;ref&gt;Ormerod, D. ''Smith and Hogan's Criminal Law''. Thirteenth Edition. Oxford University Press. 2011. Section 16.1.3 at pages 581 and 582.&lt;/ref&gt; and another Act applying to Ireland, which were repealed by section 3.

The words "if any woman shall be delivered of a child, every person" were retained in section 60 after a division in the select committee of the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]], and the members were equally divided upon the subject. The word "secret" was in like manner retained after a division in the committee.&lt;ref name="Davis 1861"/&gt;

An offence under section 60 of the Offences against the Person Act 1861 could not be tried at [[Quarter Sessions]].&lt;ref&gt;The [[Quarter Sessions Act 1842]] (5 &amp; 6 Vict c 38)&lt;/ref&gt;

Section 31 of the Offences against the Person Act 1828 made provision in relation to any person who should counsel, aid or abet the commission of, amongst other things, a misdemeanour under section 14.

==South Africa==
In South Africa, section 113 of the [[General Law Amendment Act, 1935]], amended by the [[Judicial Matters Amendment Act 66, 2008]],&lt;ref name=jma2008_gg_rsa&gt;{{cite web|title=Judicial Matters Amendment Act, No. 66 of 2008, G 31908, 17 February 2009|url=http://www.info.gov.za/view/DownloadFileAction?id=96528|publisher=Government Gazette - Republic of South Africa|accessdate=30 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  creates the offence of concealing the birth of a child:

{{quote|'''Concealment of birth of newly born child'''
113. (1) Any person who, without a lawful burial order, disposes of the body of any newly born child with intent to conceal the fact of its birth, whether the child died before, during or after birth, shall be guilty of an offence and liable on conviction to a fine or to imprisonment for a period not exceeding three years.
(2) A person may be convicted under subsection (1) although it has not been proved that the child in question died before its body was disposed of.}}

==United States==
In the [[United States]], concealing birth was once a crime punishable by [[capital punishment]]. In 1785, [[Hannah Piggen]] from [[Massachusetts]] was the last person to be [[capital punishment in the United States|put to death]] for concealing the birth/death of an infant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://users.bestweb.net/~rg/execution/FEMALES.htm |title=Female Executions |work=The Espy File   1632-1962 |accessdate=2008-09-10 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080514035210/http://users.bestweb.net/~rg/execution/FEMALES.htm |archivedate=2008-05-14 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Concealing birth remains illegal in many states. Its seriousness as a crime, however, differs from state to state, ranging from a [[felony]] in [[Arkansas]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=§ 5-26-203 - Concealing birth.|url=http://law.justia.com/codes/arkansas/2010/title-5/subtitle-3/chapter-26/subchapter-2/5-26-203/|publisher=Justia|accessdate=6 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; to a [[misdemeanor]] in [[Washington (state)|Washington]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=9.02.050 Concealing birth|url=http://law.justia.com/codes/washington/2011/title9/9-02/9-02-050.html|publisher=Justia|accessdate=6 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2879">The '''Cruelty to Animals Act 1835''' was an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] (citation 5 &amp; 6 Will. 4, c. 59), intended to protect animals, and in particular cattle, from mistreatment. Its [[Long title|full title]] is An Act to Consolidate and Amend the Several Laws Relating to the Cruel and Improper Treatment of Animals, and the Mischiefs Arising from the Driving of Cattle, and to Make Other Provisions in Regard Thereto.{{r|StatutesProject}}

The British legal action to protect animals began with the passing of the [[Cruel Treatment of Cattle Act 1822]] to Prevent Cruel and Improper Treatment of Cattle.&lt;ref&gt;''The Rights of Persons, According to the Text of Blackstone: Incorporating the Alterations Down to the Present Time'', Sir [[William Blackstone]] and James Stewart, 1839, p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt; The 1835 Act amended the existing legislation to prohibit the keeping of premises for the purpose of staging the baiting of bulls, dogs, bears, badgers or "other Animal (whether of domestic or wild Nature or Kind)",{{r|StatutesProject}} which facilitated further legislation to protect animals, create shelters, veterinary hospitals and more humane transportation and slaughter.

The law was passed in part due to lobbying by the [[Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals]] (founded 1824). The Act was repealed and replaced by the [[Cruelty to Animals Act 1849]] 12 &amp; 13 Vict. c. 92.

'''Fronteiras do Pensamento''' ''(Portuguese: Frontiers of Thought)'' is a Brazilian cultural project that promotes conferences featuring internationally known intellectuals in order to discuss issues of contemporaneity. Scientific discovery, social research, sustainable solutions, philosophical theses, influences on the ways of understanding and interpreting the world, social/political leadership and activism, are a few of the issues discussed during Frontiers of Thought’s annual conference seasons. The project’s online content is freely available worldwide, and offers hundreds of videos, subtitled in Portuguese, Spanish and English, as well as articles, news and interviews.

== History ==
Frontieiras do Pensamento is a cultural project conceived in 2006, in the city of [[Porto Alegre]], Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 'O mundo das ideias pode ser um ponto de encontro, não só de divergência' diz criador do Fronteiras do Pensamento|url = http://brasileiros.com.br/2015/06/o-brasil-nao-vive-necessariamente-uma-crise-diz-criador-fronteiras-pensamento/|accessdate = 2015-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, during its sixth edition, [[Christopher Hitchens]], [[Jorge Castañeda Gutman|Jorge Castañeda]], [[Luc Ferry]], [[Michel Maffesoli]] and [[Michel Houellebecq]] – among others – spoke on the stage of the Salão de Atos in the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS) giving the project international projection. In 2008, the second edition featured 25 lecturers. [[Edgar Morin]], [[David Lynch]], [[Philip Glass]] and [[Wim Wenders]] were among them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Fronteiras do Pensamento - Revista Cult|url = http://revistacult.uol.com.br/home/2010/12/fronteiras-do-pensamento/|website = Revista Cult|accessdate = 2015-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; During that year, the project also took place at the city of [[Salvador, Brazil]]. In 2009, lectures featured [[Eric Maskin]], [[Howard Gardner]], [[Steven Pinker]] and [[Tom Wolfe]] and, in 2010, [[Carlo Ginzburg]], [[Daniel Dennett]], [[Daniel Cohn-Bendit]] and [[Mario Vargas Llosa]], who spoke only a few days after being awarded the Nobel Literature Prize. Until 2011, Frontiers of Thought had already featured 98 internationally known guests. During that year, seasons extended to the city of [[São Paulo]]. The special season kept taking place in Salvador and, now, in [[Florianópolis]]. In 2011, [[Edgar Morin]] and [[Luc Ferry]] returned to Frontiers of Thought's stage, with them, [[Fredric Jameson]], [[Garry Kasparov]], [[Mohsen Makhmalbaf]], [[Orhan Pamuk]] and [[Shirin Ebadi]].

Among the 2012 edition lecturers were the Nobel Peace Prize [[Mohamed ElBaradei]], from Egypt, and Nobel Economy Prize Winner [[Amartya Sen]], from India. Also, Mozambican writer [[Mia Couto]], Colombian urbanist [[Enrique Peñalosa]] and British philosopher [[Simon Blackburn]], among others such as [[Vandana Shiva]] and  [[Susan Greenfield]].

In 2013, under the theme "Ideas make a difference", the project had 24 guests. Among them, Portuguese neuroscientist [[António Damásio]], Nobel Peace Prize winner [[José Ramos-Horta]] and the Spanish sociologist [[Manuel Castells]].

In 2014, discussing the theme "The reinvention of the world", Frontiers of Thought invited [[Salman Rushdie]], [[Gro Brundtland]], [[Brian Greene]], [[Michael Sandel]], and others.

The 2015 edition features the theme "How to live together", and guests [[Richard Dawkins]], [[Jimmy Wales]], [[Fernando Savater]], [[John Gray (philosopher)|John Gray]], [[Saskia Sassen]], [[Richard Sennett]], [[Valter hugo mãe|Valter Hugo Mãe]], [[Suzana Herculano-Houzel]], [[Janette Sadik-Khan]], [[Ferreira Gullar]], [[Camille Paglia]], [[Joseph Stiglitz]], [[Contardo Calligaris]], [[Luc Ferry]], [[Manuel Castells]], [[Pierre Lévy]] and [[John Elkington (business author)|John Elkington]], touring the four cities that host the project – not all cities will have the same lecturers.

== Formats ==
Fronteiras do Pensamento has two different formats: annual seasons and special series. The annual seasons take place in Porto Alegre and São Paulo, Brazil, during the whole year. In both cities, the audience buys tickets for all lectures. The special series take place in Florianópolis and Salvador, in specific times, and tickets can be bought for a single event.

Brigadier general '''Giora "Hawkeye" Epstein''' ({{lang-he|גיורא אפשטיין}}; born May 20, 1938), today '''Giora Even''' ({{lang-he|גיורא אבן}}), is a retired brigadier General in the [[Israeli Air Force]] (IAF) and a fighter ace credited with 17 victories, 16 against Egyptian jets, making Epstein the [[List of aces of aces#Fighter Aces|ace of aces]] of supersonic fighter jets and of the Israeli Air Force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode

Epstein was an active IAF pilot from 1963 until 1998, when he retired at age 60. He, like many retired IAF flyers, later worked as captain for [[El Al]] Airlines.

== Early career ==
Epstein joined the Israeli Defense Force (IDF) in 1956 during the [[Sinai War]]. He was initially rejected from flight school because of a heart condition and began his military career as a paratrooper. While traveling with the IDF's parachute demonstration team, Epstein changed his last name to Even ("stone" in Hebrew). He left the IDF in 1959 before returning two years later to again apply for flight school.

After gaining medical clearance (mostly through his own stubbornness), Epstein began fighter training. He soon gained the nickname "Hawkeye" due to his extraordinary eyesight. Epstein was allegedly able to spot aircraft at a distance of 24 miles (44&amp;nbsp;km) — nearly three times further than a normal pilot.

== Victories: 1967–1973 ==
[[File:Hatzerim Mirage 20100129 1.jpg|thumb|Israeli Air Force Mirage IIICJ]]

Epstein's first kill came on June 6, 1967 during the [[Six-Day War]], when he downed an Egyptian [[Sukhoi Su-7|Sukhoi-7]] at El Arish. During the [[War of Attrition]] in 1969–70, Epstein downed a [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-17|MiG-17]], another Sukhoi-7 and two [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21|MiG 21]]s. The rest of his kills came during 1973's [[Yom Kippur War]]. Between October 18 and 20, 1973, he downed an [[Mil Mi-8|Mi-8]] helicopter and eight jets: two Sukhoi-7s, two [[Su-20|Sukhoi-20]]s and four MiG 21s. Then, on October 24, 1973, Epstein downed three more MiG-21s west of the [[Great Bitter Lake]]. Eight of these victories were with the French-built [[Dassault Mirage III|Mirage III]], a [[delta wing]] fighter designed primarily as a high altitude interceptor. His other nine victories came in an [[IAI Nesher]], an Israeli-built version of the [[Dassault Mirage 5|Mirage 5]]. Five of his claims were downed using air-to-air missiles, the rest with cannon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amazing-airplanes.com/amazing_acheivements/best_pilot.php |title=The best pilot|website=amazing-airplanes.com|accessdate=6 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Later career and retirement ==
After the Yom Kippur War, Epstein received the [[Medal of Distinguished Service]], one of Israel's highest military honors. He went on to command [[Mirage (aircraft)|Mirage]] and [[IAI Kfir|Kfir]] squadrons and was flying "ready" missions in the [[F-16]] up until his 60th birthday. After retiring from the IAF, Epstein became a captain for [[El Al]] Airlines.

Epstein was the primary subject of the "Desert Aces" episode of The History Channel series ''[[Dogfights (TV series)|Dogfights]]''. The episode first aired on August 10, 2007.

'''Goojje''' ({{zh|c={{linktext|谷|姐}}|p=Gǔjiě}}, {{IPA-cmn|ku˧˥tɕjɛ˨˩|IPA}}) is a [[spoof website]]{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} of [[Google China]], which encourages the real site to stay online and comply with [[Internet censorship in the People's Republic of China]].&lt;ref name="BBC 27 January"&gt;{{cite news

| title= Google 'sister' launches in China 
| publisher= [[BBC News]]
| date= January 27, 2010
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site was created after Google executives publicly threatened to shut down the Chinese site following the [[Operation Aurora]] [[cyber attack]] on Google China,&lt;ref name="Reuters 27 January"&gt;{{cite news 
| url= http://ca.reuters.com/article/technologyNews/idCATRE60Q1ZC20100127
| title= Google's "older sister" in China urges it to stay

| date= January 27, 2010
}}&lt;/ref&gt; which some [[computer security]] experts believe may have come from [[Chinese intelligence activity in other countries|within China]] as in the [[GhostNet]] [[cyber spying]] operation. Google China executives had also publicly condemned the necessity of [[Censorship by Google|filtering search results]] in line with the [[Golden Shield Project]] (also known as the Great Firewall of China), which some commentators have stated appears to run counter to Google's [[mantra]], ''[[Don't be evil]]''.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}{{clarify|date=November 2013}}

Goojjee, founded on January 14, 2010 also allows searches to be run, but apparently uses Google and [[Baidu]] to do the actual searches.  Google has demanded that Goojje stop using its logo, but Goojje has refused.&lt;ref name="Goojje 'will not change'"&gt;Jie, Yan, "[http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2010-02/10/content_9453554.htm Goojje 'will not change']", ''[[China Daily]]'', February 10, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
[[File:IllegalFlowerTribute1.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Illegal flower tribute]] (非法献花) left outside Google China's headquarters after its announcement it may leave the country]]
Google in Chinese is {{lang|zh|谷歌}} ([[pinyin]]: {{lang|pny|Gǔgē}}), a [[Transcription (linguistics)|transcription]] without regard to its meaning of "[[:wikt:谷|valley]] [[:wikt:歌|song]]". The [[Chinese name]] of ''Goojje'' can be interpreted as having meaning of "the sister of Google". The ''jje'' phoneme is from the word for sister, "jie jie (姐姐)", which mirrors how Google's last syllable (歌) [[Homophone|sounds like]] "ge ge (哥哥)" (brother).

It is said that Goojje is created by a [[female]] who is infatuated with [[Google]]. Due to Google's withdrawal from [[China]], she decided to build Goojje in memory of it. The website's [[propaganda]] is "Goojje it, loneliness all eliminated"

==Staff==
All staff members of Goojje were born in the generation after the 1980s. Goojje appears to be run by just one person, Huang Jiongxuan, a female [[List of universities in China|college student]] from [[Guangdong]].&lt;ref name="shanghaiist 28 jan"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Huang stated in February 2010 that the website had yet to turn a profit,&lt;ref name="Goojje 'will not change'"/&gt; however as of February 2016 it is estimated it now has a net worth of 1530.85CYN (235USD).&lt;ref&gt;http://userexp.org/goojje.net.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synthesis==
The preparation of quinolones bearing a substituent at position 5 is complicated by the greater electrophilic character of the 8 position. One scheme for resolving the problem consists in blocking access to position 8 by first adding a readily removable group to that center.
[[File:Grepafloxacin synthesis.svg|thumb|center|700px|Grepafloxacin synthesis:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1021/jm00107a040| pmid = 2002456| title = Synthesis and biological activity of 5-alkyl-1,7,8-trisubstituted-6-fluoroquinoline-3-carboxylic acids| journal = Journal of Medicinal Chemistry| volume = 34| issue = 3| pages = 1155| year = 1991| last1 = Hagen | first1 = S.

The scheme starts with the conversion of the carboxylic acid in ('''1''') to its dimethyloxazoline derivative ('''3''') by reaction with the [[aminomethyl propanol]] ('''2'''). [[Lithium diisopropylamide]] (LDA) then removes a proton from the 8 position; treatment of that anion with [[trimethylsilyl iodide]] leads to the silylated intermediate ('''4'''). A second round of LDA then generates a [[carbanion]] at the only open position; reaction with [[methyl iodide]] leads to the corresponding 5 methyl derivative ('''5'''). Treatment of that product with [[cesium fluoride]] breaks the carbon–silicon bond, removing the silyl group; aqueous acid then hydrolyzes the [[oxazoline]] to afford the free acid ('''6'''). This last intermediate is then taken on to the quinolone ('''9''') &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1002/jhet.5570270616| title = Synthesis of 5-methyl-4-oxo-quinolinecarboxylic acids| journal = Journal of Heterocyclic Chemistry| volume = 27| issue = 6| pages = 1609| year = 1990| last1 = Hagen | first1 = S. E. | last2 = Domagala | first2 = J. M. }}&lt;/ref&gt; by essentially the same scheme as that used to prepare [[difloxacin]], with the difference that the chain elongation is by means of Grignard reagent of [[ethyl bromoacetate]]. Treatment of ('''9''') with 2-methylpiperazine proceeds by reaction at the less hindered of the two amino groups; [[saponification]] then affords grepafloxacin ('''10''').

== Stereochemistry ==
Grepafloxacin contains a stereocenter and consists of two enantiomers. This is a [[racemate]], ie a 1: 1 mixture of (''R'')- and the (''S'')-forms:

'''Health care fraud''' includes health insurance fraud, [[drug fraud]], and [[quackery|medical fraud]]. Health insurance fraud occurs when a company or an individual defrauds an insurer or government health care program, such as [[Medicare (United States)]] or equivalent State programs. The manner in which this is done varies, and persons engaging in fraud are always seeking new ways to circumvent the law. Damages from fraud can be recovered by use of the [[False Claims Act]], most commonly under the ''[[qui tam]]'' provisions which rewards an individual for being a "[[whistleblower]]", or [[relator (law)]].&lt;ref name="DOJHealthCareFraudReport"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justice.gov/usao/tne/health_care.html|title=Department of Justice|publisher=Department of Justice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recent news and statistics==
The [[FBI]] estimates that ''Health Care Fraud'' costs American tax payers $80 billion a year.&lt;ref name="FBIHealthCareGeneral"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/investigate/white_collar/health-care-fraud|title=FBI-Health Care Fraud|publisher=FBI}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of this amount $2.5 billion was recovered through ''False Claims Act'' cases in FY 2010. Most of these cases were filed under ''qui tam'' provisions.

Over the course of FY 2010, ''whistleblowers'' were paid a total of $307,620,401.00 for their part in bringing the cases forward.&lt;ref name="FY2010Stats"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oig.hhs.gov/publications/docs/hcfac/hcfacreport2010.pdf|title=The Department of Health and Human Services and The Department of Justice; Health Care Fraud and Abuse Control Program Annual Report for Fiscal Year 2010|date=January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
There are several different schemes&lt;ref name="FBIFraudTypes"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/stats-services/publications/fcs_report2006/financial-crimes-report-to-the-public-fiscal-year-2006#Health|publisher=FBI|year=2006|title=Financial Crimes to the Public Report 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; used to defraud the [[Health care system]].

*Unnecessary services

*Copied and pasted entries into the medical record&lt;ref&gt;VA inspector says Alabama doctor's acts may be insurance fraud.  USA TODAY NETWORK
Mary Troyan. Montgomery Advertiser July 29, 2014. http://usat.ly/1mYBGqf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Billing for services not rendered===
Often done as a way of billing Medicare for things that never happened. This can involve forging the signature of those enrolled in Medicare, and the use of bribes or "[[kickbacks]]" to corrupt medical professionals.&lt;ref name="FBIFraudTypes"/&gt;

===Upcoding of services===
Billing Medicare programs for services that are more costly than the actual procedure that was done.&lt;ref name="FBIFraudTypes"/&gt;

===Upcoding of items===
Similar to upcoding of services, but involving the use of medical equipment. An example is billing Medicare for a power-assisted [[wheelchair]] while only giving the patient a manual wheelchair.&lt;ref name="FBIFraudTypes"/&gt;

===Duplicate claims===
In this case a provider does not submit exactly the same bill, but changes some small portion like the date in order to charge Medicare twice for the same service rendered. Rather than a single claim being filed twice, the same service is billed two times in an attempt to be paid twice.&lt;ref name="FBIFraudTypes"/&gt;

===Unbundling===
Bills for a particular service are submitted in piecemeal, that appear to be staggered out over time. These services would normally cost less when bundled together, but by manipulating the claim, a higher charge is billed to Medicare resulting in a higher pay out to the party committing the fraud.&lt;ref name="FBIFraudTypes"/&gt;

===Excessive services===
Occurs when Medicare is billed for something greater than what the level of actual care requires. This can include medical related equipment as well as services.&lt;ref name="FBIFraudTypes"/&gt;

===Unnecessary services===
Unlike excessive services, this fraudulent scheme occurs when claims are filed for care that in no way applies to the condition of a patient, such as an echo cardiogram billed for a patient with a sprained ankle.&lt;ref name="FBIFraudTypes"/&gt;

===Kickbacks===
[[Kickbacks]] are rewards such as cash, jewelry, free vacations, corporate sponsored retreats, or other lavish gifts used to entice medical professionals into using specific medical services. This could be a small cash kickback for the use of an MRI when not required, or a lavish doctor/patient retreat that is funded by a pharmaceutical company to entice the prescription and use of a particular drug.&lt;ref name="FBIFraudTypes"/&gt;

People engaging in this type of fraud are also subject to the federal Anti-Kickback statute.

==Examples==
In the case United States ex rel. Donigian v. St. Jude Medical, Inc., No. 06-CA-11166-DPW (D. Mass.) St. Jude Medical, Inc. agreed to pay $16 million to quiet allegations of paying kickbacks to physicians. The whistleblower was able to provide detailed insider information as to the nature of the kickbacks, which ranged from entertainment to sporting event tickets and other gifts. The relator in this case was awarded $2.64 million.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}&lt;!--- PRWeb is not a reliable source. &lt;ref name="StJudeSettleRelease"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prweb.com/releases/2011/1/prweb8082432.htm|title=St. Jude Medical, Inc. Settlement|publisher=PRWeb|date=2011-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DOJJudeSettle"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2011/January/11-civ-078.html|title=Justice News|publisher=Department of Justice|date=2011-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;

The case United States et al., ex rel. Jim Conrad and Constance Conrad v. Forest Pharmaceuticals, Inc, et al., No. 02-cv-11738-NG (D. Mass.) involved a drug manufacturer selling a drug, Levothroid, that had never been approved by the FDA. These allegations settled for $42.5 million due to multiple whistleblowers stepping forward to provide detailed information on the alleged fraud. The collective reward to the relators in this case was over $14.6 million.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}&lt;!--- PRWeb is not a reliable source.&lt;ref name="ForestSettleRelease"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prweb.com/releases/2010/09/prweb4525334.htm|title=Forest Whistleblower Cases Settle for Over $300 million|publisher=PRWeb|date=2010-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;&lt;ref name="DOJForestSettle"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2010/September/10-civ-1028.html|title=Drug Maker Forest Pleads Guilty|publisher=Department of Justice|date=2010-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Copied and pasted entries into the Electronic Medical Record may constitute fraud. A U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, Veterans Health Administration pulmonologist at the Montgomery, Alabama facility copied and pasted data entered by other physicians into electronic medical records that he signed. The VA Office of the Medical Inspector reported this finding to Congress in 2013.

==Reporting fraud==
There are many ways to report cases of fraud. If a patient or health care provider believes they have witnessed Health Care Fraud, they are encouraged to contact the FBI via either their local office, telephone, or the online tips form.

If, however, they want to ensure the government actively investigates the alleged fraud, they are encouraged to contact legal counsel from an experienced firm that specializes in ''[[qui tam]]'' litigation under the [[False Claims Act]]. A good legal team can advise potential [[whistleblower]]s of their rights, protections, and what evidence is necessary to solidify a case against the group leading the fraud.

A '''LAN Gaming Center''' is a business where one 
can use a [[computer]] connected over a [[Local Area Network|LAN]] to 
other computers, primarily for the purpose of playing [[Multiplayer video game|multiplayer]] 
[[computer games]]. Use of these computers or game consoles costs a fee, usually per hour or minute; sometimes one can have unmetered access with a pass for a day or month, etc. It may or may not serve as a 
regular [[café]] as well, with food and drinks being served. Many game 
centers have evolved in recent years to also include console gaming 
([[Xbox (console)|Xbox]], [[Nintendo GameCube|GameCube]], [[PlayStation 2]]).  Other 
centers offer computer repair and [[Consultant|consulting]], custom 
built computers ([[White box computer]]), [[web design]], [[Computer programming|programming]] 
classes or [[summer camp]]s, and many other [[technology]] related 
services. Centers are starting to offer [[PS3]]s, [[Wii]]s and 
[[Xbox 360]]s that are playable in store.

[[LAN]] gaming centers can come in various sizes and styles, from the 
very small (6-8 computers) to the very large (400+ computers).  Most 
have computer systems with higher-end hardware built specifically for 
computer gaming.  Customers can play games with (or against) in-house 
opponents and most also include a [[Broadband|high-speed]] [[Internet]] 
connection to allow customers to play games with online opponents as 
well (usually at the same time).  Most also host a number of special 
events such as [[tournaments]] and [[LAN party|LAN parties]], some 
lasting throughout the night.  Another typical feature is the ability to browse the [[World Wide Web|Web]] and use [[instant messaging]] clients.  Often these gaming centers allow customers the option of 
renting out the whole or part of the store for private LAN parties. LAN 
centers are typically decorated in such a way as to enhance the already 
present gaming atmosphere, such as adding black-light lightbulbs and 
gaming paraphernalia and posters around the center. A standard LAN 
gaming center will have rows of computers next to each other with 
highback leather computer chairs.

There are over 650 LAN centers in the US, while 90% of the LAN Centers 
in the world are in China, the largest having over 1777 
seats.&lt;ref name="jones"&gt;{{cite web

It is common for a LAN gaming centers to sell the games that they had already installed for their in-house computers, most notably [[MMORPGs]] and many FPS games.

The first LAN Gaming center located on a college campus was Savage 
Geckos which was opened by [[Bruce McCulloch Jones]] as a tenant of 
[[Eastern Michigan University]]'s Student Center, both opening on 
November 6, 2006.&lt;ref name="soltis"&gt;{{cite web

PS3s, Wiis, 10 networked gaming PCs and theatre seating (with cup 
holders) for game play, LCD screens, video projectors and a 
retail/arcade/hang out area.   This center hosted some of the first 
on-campus intercollegiate play with a [[Halo 3]] tournament between 
students from [[Eastern Michigan University]], [[University of Michigan]], 
[[Michigan State University]] and [[Oakland University]].  
The operation lasted until Spring of 2008 when it was purchased by the 
university.&lt;ref name="soltis" /&gt; Mr. Jones made a series of presentations to the Association of College

'''Lyrical ballet''' is an offshoot of the now-obsolete Russian lyrical (Soviet ballroom) dances.  It is a lilting style of dance that uses the ballet technique along with the Soviet ballroom dance forms. The word lyrical refers to a lilting, poetic feel associated with the movements and the steps flow from the one to the next. It belongs to the genre of classical folk dance.

==History==

The origins of lyrical ballet lie in the [[Soviet ballroom dances]], the Russian lyrical dance in particular. The Russian lyrical dance was a progressive dance based on Russian folk tunes with a soft and smooth character, danced at medium tempo, in 2/4 or 4/4 time. Today, the nomenclature 'Russian lyrical' has lost its relevance but the dance form remains and continues to flourish under the term of lyrical ballet.

==Form and technique==

The technique is that of ballet abiding by the rules of turnout and body alignment in which is also incorporated the different Soviet ballroom dance steps.  A distinguishing feature of lyrical ballet as opposed to [[lyrical dance]] is that it does not make any departure from the classical style and takes no liberties with its rigid structure.  Therefore, it is unlikely to find the turning-in of legs or finger-gestures that are common in [[jazz dance]] choreography.

==Costume==

The costume of this dance is a flared skirt (usually knee length between the long ball-gowns and the short tutu) allowing free flow of movement between the legs.

'''''Made in Dagenham''''' is a musical with music by [[David Arnold]], lyrics by [[Richard Thomas (musician)|Richard Thomas]], and a book by [[Richard Bean]]. Based on the 2010 [[Made in Dagenham|film of the same name]], which in turn was based on the real events of the [[Ford sewing machinists strike of 1968]],&lt;ref name="film"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/157962-Made-in-Dagenham-Film-Being-Adapted-as-West-End-Musical-Rupert-Goold-Will-Direct | title="Made in Dagenham" Film Being Adapted as West End Musical; Rupert Goold Will Direct |work=Playbill | date=23 December 2011 | accessdate=1 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; the musical made its [[West End Theatre|West End]] and world premiere at the [[Adelphi Theatre]] in 2014.

The 2010 film received several award nominations, and the following year, it was announced that a musical was under development. Former [[Bond girl]] [[Gemma Arterton]] was cast in the role of Rita, a working woman and mother who becomes a union leader amidst the strike, despite the wishes of her husband and children, who feel neglected by her focus on labour issues.

''Made in Dagenham'' opened for previews on 5 October 2014 at the [[Adelphi Theatre]].  It opened on 9 November to mixed but generally positive reviews.  Despite the good reception, it is closed on 11 April 2015, due to poor ticket sales.

== Critical reception ==

The musical received mixed but generally positive reviews. [[Quentin Letts]] deemed it "witty, fun, fitfully inventive and distinctly English".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Letts | first=Quentin | authorlink=Quentin Letts | url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2822881/Bond-girl-conveyor-belt-raucous-fun-Quentin-Letts-night-review-Dagenham-Musical.html | title=Bond girl and a conveyor belt of raucous fun | publisher=[[Daily Mail]] | work=dailymail.co.uk | date=6 November 2014 | accessdate=8 November 2014 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Henry Hitchings]], for the ''[[Evening Standard]]'', regarded it as "robustly likeable — mixing passionate populism with bursts of big-budget flamboyance".&lt;ref name = "hitchings"&gt;{{cite web | last=Hitchings | first=Henry | authorlink= Henry Hitchings | url=https://www.standard.co.uk/goingout/theatre/made-in-dagenham-adelphi-theatre--theatre-review-gemma-arterton-is-radiant-in-this-deeply-british-musical-9843096.html | title='Gemma Arterton is radiant in this unapologetically British musical' | publisher=[[Evening Standard]] | work=standard.co.uk | date=6 November 2014 | accessdate=8 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paul Taylor, for ''[[The Independent]]'', called it "a West End musical you can be pleased to acknowledge was 'made in Britain'&amp;nbsp;".&lt;ref name = "taylor"&gt;{{cite news | last=Taylor | first= Paul |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/theatre-dance/reviews/made-in-dagenham-first-night-review-gemma-arterton-leads-the-cast-beautifully-9841220.html | title=This pleasing West End musical really was Made in Britain | publisher=[[The Independent]] | work=independent.co.uk | date=6 November 2014 | accessdate=24 January 2015 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, even some of those who praised the musical criticised some aspects of the production, with Hitchings calling it "occasionally crass and a little too manipulative (the final number ["Stand Up"] is an especially brazen bid to get us on our feet)".&lt;ref name = "hitchings" /&gt; Taylor suggested ''Made in Dagenham'' was "uneven but captivating".&lt;ref name = "taylor" /&gt;

Others were more critical. Simon Edge, for the ''[[Daily Express]]'', complained of an "underpowered central performance from Gemma Arterton as Rita&amp;nbsp;... she lacks any of the goofy charisma that Sally Hawkins brought to the film role, so that it's hard to see how her character ever came to the fore of this dispute".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last= Edge | first = Simon | url=http://www.express.co.uk/entertainment/theatre/532169/Made-In-Dagenham-Gemma-Arterton | title=Gemma Arterton is 'underpowered' as ringleader Rita  4 / 5 stars | publisher=[[Daily Express]] | work=express.co.uk | date=6 November 2014 | accessdate=8 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael Billington (critic)|Michael Billington]], in his review for ''[[The Guardian]]'', opined that Arnold's score "rarely rises above the functional".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/nov/05/made-in-dagenham-play-adelphi-gemma-arterton | title=Brassy Gemma Arterton musical lacks passion | publisher=[[The Guardian]] | work=theguardian.com | date=5 November 2014 | accessdate=8 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Major general (United States)|Major General]] '''Marion Eugene Carl''' (November 1, 1915 – June 28, 1998) was a World War II [[fighter ace]], record-setting [[test pilot]], and [[naval aviator]]. He was the [[United States Marine Corps]]' first ace in World War II.

==Early years==
Born on the family dairy farm near [[Hubbard, Oregon]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/06/30/us/maj-gen-marion-e-carl-82-marine-air-ace-in-world-war-ii.html|title=Maj. Gen. Marion E. Carl, 82, Marine Air Ace in World War II|last=Goldstein|first=Richard|date=1998-06-30|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-05-13|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carl was always attracted to [[aviation]]. He learned to fly while attending college and soloed after only 2½ hours of instruction; eight to ten hours is typical. He studied engineering at [[Oregon State University|Oregon State College]] (now a university) and, in 1938, graduated as a lieutenant in the Army Reserve.

==Marine Corps career==
Carl resigned his commission to become a naval aviation cadet and received his "wings of gold" and [[Marine Corps]] commission in December 1939. His first posting was to Marine Fighting Squadron One ([[VMF-1]]) at [[Quantico, Virginia]]. After a year there, he was posted back to [[Naval Air Station Pensacola|Pensacola]] as an instructor pilot helping to train the rapidly growing number of naval aviators, before receiving orders to the newly formed Marine Fighting Squadron 221 ([[VMF-221]]) at [[NAS North Island]] in [[San Diego]], [[California]].

===World War II===
The 7 December 1941 [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] found VMF-221 preparing to embark aboard the [[aircraft carrier]] {{USS|Saratoga|CV-3|6}} for transport to [[Marine Corps Air Station Ewa]] on the island of [[Oahu]], [[Hawaii]]. The unit was rushed to Hawaii, then to Wake Island as part of the WI Relief Task Force, still aboard ''Saratoga''. After the relief attempt was canceled, VMF-221 was deployed to [[Midway Atoll]] on Christmas Day, 1941. Carl's first combat occurred six months later during the [[Battle of Midway]] on June 4, 1942,&lt;ref&gt;Carl's action on that memorable day is documented in [[Edward H. Sims]]' book ''Greatest Fighter Missions'', as the first chapter of that compilation.&lt;/ref&gt; when 15 of the 25 aircraft VMF-221 put into the air that morning were destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;Because of the unexpected resistance offered by the defending VMF-221 fighters, the Japanese fleet admiral decided to launch another (previously unplanned) attack on the island, a decision which led to a bizarre string of activities, at last resulting in the near-complete destruction of the Japanese attack force.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Carl was credited with destroying one enemy aircraft, a [[Mitsubishi Zero]]. All the survivors of VMF-221 were returned to Hawaii shortly after the battle.

After a short rest, Carl was reassigned to Marine Fighting Squadron 223 ([[VMF-223]]), led by former VMF-221 pilot Captain (later Major) [[John Lucian Smith|John L. Smith]]. On August 20, VMF-223 was deployed to [[Battle of Guadalcanal|Guadalcanal]], the first fighter unit ashore with the [[Cactus Air Force]]. Over the next two months, Carl became the Marines' first ace, running his tally to 16.5 victories, during which time he had to bail out once from a badly-damaged airplane. It is believed that on August 26 Carl shot down the famous Japanese Navy ''[[Tainan Air Group|Tainan Kōkūtai]]'' ace [[Junichi Sasai]] over Henderson Field. When the squadron left Guadalcanal in October, Carl was America's second-ranking ace behind Major Smith.

In 1943, then-[[Major (United States)|Major]] Carl returned to the Pacific and led VMF-223 until the following summer. During combat in the [[Solomon Islands]], he claimed two more enemy planes, finishing as the Corps' seventh-ranking ace with 18.5 victories.

===Test pilot===
In 1945, Carl graduated in the first [[test pilot]] class at [[Naval Air Station Patuxent River]], [[Maryland]]. As a [[Lieutenant colonel (United States)|lieutenant colonel]], he conducted pioneering [[jet aircraft|jet]] operations from [[aircraft carriers]] and later commanded [[VMF-122]], the first Marine jet squadron.
[[File:Douglas D-558-I with pilots Carl and Cladwell 1947.jpg|thumb|Carl and Commander Caldwell with a D-558-1 at Muroc (1947)]]
In 1947, Carl was one of two pilots selected to fly the [[Douglas D-558-1 Skystreak|Douglas D-558/I Skystreak]] in record-setting speed attempts. That August, he was recorded at {{convert|650|mph|kph}}, establishing a new world record for a conventional aircraft. When [[United States Air Force|Air Force]] [[Captain (United States)|Captain]] [[Chuck Yeager]] broke the [[sound barrier]] in October, he also broke Carl's record.

At Patuxent River on April 1, 1952, Carl had a close brush with death. He was performing a series of check spins in the new [[Grumman AF Guardian|Grumman AF-2S Guardian]] anti-submarine attack aircraft. The anti-spin parachute that had been fitted in earlier tests had been removed. Climbing to {{convert|10000|ft|m}} over Chesapeake Bay, Carl commenced the spin. The aircraft entered a flat spin with strong centrifugal forces. Carl could not break the spin and rode it down to {{convert|4000|ft|m|abbr=on}}. He tried to operate the ejection seat, but the face blind ripped away in his hands and the seat failed to fire. He climbed out at {{convert|3000|ft|m}}. He then tried the wind-tunnel approved method of getting out on the inside of the spin, but was forced back due to airflow. He finally got out on the other side and felt his parachute open as he fell into the splash of the aircraft. The success of this proved bailing out on the inside of the spin to avoid being hit by the tail was an incorrect theory.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eric Brown (pilot)|Eric Brown]], ''Wings on my Sleeve'', Phoenix Press 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

During a second test pilot tour in 1953, Carl set an unofficial altitude record of {{convert|83000|ft|m}} in the [[Douglas Skyrocket|Douglas D-558/II]].

Between test pilot duties, Carl commanded other units including a [[reconnaissance]] squadron based on [[Taiwan]]. In 1954, he led missions over [[Mainland China]], photographing [[Communist]] forces along the coast. After his death, an incorrect version of his reconnaissance missions appeared in several obituaries, stating that he had flown [[Lockheed U-2|U-2]] spy planes.

===Vietnam War===
[[File:Marine general officers symposium group photo 1967.jpg|thumb|Carl (1st from left, middle row) at the 1967 General Officers Symposium]]
Though still a [[colonel]], Carl became Director of Marine Corps Aviation for five months in 1962. In 1964 he was promoted to [[Brigadier general (United States)|brigadier general]]; in 1965, he took the First Marine [[Brigade]] to [[Danang]], [[South Vietnam]].  Despite his seniority, he repeatedly flew combat missions in [[helicopter gunships]] and jet fighters.

Carl received his second star as a [[Major general (United States)|major general]] in 1967, commanding the [[2nd Marine Aircraft Wing]] at [[Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point|MCAS Cherry Point]], [[North Carolina]] from 1968 to 1970. He subsequently served as [[Inspector General]] of the Marine Corps, until retiring in 1973. By then he had logged some 13,000 flying hours, more than twice as much as most contemporaries.

==Murder==
Carl returned to his native Oregon, where he and his wife Edna settled near [[Roseburg, Oregon|Roseburg]].

His murderer, 19-year-old Jesse Fanus, was apprehended one week later. In April 1999, he was convicted on two counts of aggravated murder (and 11 additional felony charge) and sentenced to death. In 2003, his conviction and death sentence were upheld by the Oregon Supreme Court.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4177">[[File:Joseph asked for the body of Christ from Pilate.jpg|right|thumb|250px|A medieval depiction of Joseph asking for the body of Christ from Pilate]]
'''Matthew 27:58''' is the fifty-eighth verse of the twenty-seventh chapter of the [[Gospel of Matthew]] in the [[New Testament]]. This verse describes [[Joseph of Arimathea]] meeting with [[Pontius Pilate]] to secure the [[burial of Jesus]].

The original [[Koine Greek]], according to [[The New Testament in the Original Greek|Westcott and Hort]], reads:
:ουτος προσελθων τω πιλατω ητησατο το σωμα 
:του ιησου τοτε ο πιλατος εκελευσεν αποδοθηναι

In the [[King James Version]] of the Bible it is translated as:
:He went to Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus. 
:Then Pilate commanded the body to be delivered.

The modern [[World English Bible]] translates the passage as:
:This man went to Pilate, and asked for Jesus' body. 
:Then Pilate commanded the body to be given up. 

For a collection of other versions see [http://bibref.hebtools.com/?book=%20Matthew&amp;verse=27:58&amp;src=! BibRef Matthew 27:58]

These same events are related by [[Mark 15:43]]-[[Mark 15:45|45]], [[Luke 23:52]], and [[John 19:38]]. Mark has some more details, noting that it was "bold" of Joseph to approach Pilate, and also has Pilate exclaiming on how quickly Jesus died. Matthew, Luke, and John do not have these details. Gundry notes that at the time Mark was written the question posed by skeptics was whether Jesus really was dead. By the time Matthew was written this had faded as an issue, to be replaced by the allegation that the disciples had stolen Jesus' body. Thus Matthew drops the sections emphasizing that Jesus was truly dead, and adds much evidence that the body could not have been stolen.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert H. Gundry|Gundry, Robert H.]] ''Matthew a Commentary on his Literary and Theological Art.'' Grand Rapids: William B. Eerdmans Publishing Company, 1982. pg. 580&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a much longer version of this scene found in the non-canonical [[Gospel of Peter]] that explains the special access by claiming that Joseph was a friend of Pilate. The Gospel of Peter version also puts the blame for Jesus' death more clearly on the Jewish leaders than on Pilate.&lt;ref&gt;[[R. T. France|France, R.T.]]. ''The Gospel of Matthew.'' Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 2007 pg. 1090&lt;/ref&gt;

Approaching Pilate was a bold move, it would publicly associate Joseph with a criminal executed for defying the empire. France notes that this is somewhat explained by Matthew's presentation of Pilate as being ambivalent towards the execution, with the true driving force being the Jewish leaders.&lt;ref&gt;[[R. T. France|France, R.T.]]. ''The Gospel of Matthew.'' Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 2007 pg. 1090&lt;/ref&gt;

Roman law and tradition was to leave the bodies of executed criminals to decompose upon the cross. This violated Jewish custom that all bodies be buried by sundown on the same day. There is evidence that Roman governors of Palestine did regularly compromise the rules to allow the bodies of Jewish criminals to be buried according to custom. Contemporary sources make special note of cases where this exception was not allowed. Typically the body would have been handed over to the Jewish authorities, who would have buried it in a mass grave set aside for criminals. There are contemporary records of bodies being handed over to other individuals, so these events are not impossible.&lt;ref&gt;Keener, Craig S. ''A commentary on the Gospel of Matthew'' Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 2005 pg. 693&lt;/ref&gt;

Keener notes that proper burials were not just part of Jewish tradition. Greco-Roman literature of the period has several examples of noble heroes taking great risks to ensure a proper burial.&lt;ref&gt;Keener, Craig S. ''A commentary on the Gospel of Matthew'' Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 2005 pg. 693&lt;/ref&gt;

What has become known as the first [[Miss America]] pageant was, at its start in 1921, an activity designed to attract tourists to extend their [[Labor Day]] holiday weekend and enjoy festivities in [[Atlantic City]], [[New Jersey]]. Atlantic City's Inter-City Beauty Contest, as it was initially called, attracted over 1,500 photographic entries from around the country, all vying to win the "Golden Mermaid" award and cash prizes.

Six "Inter-City Beauties," arrived in Atlantic City and entered a new event: The "Inter-City Beauty" Contest. It was judged in stylish afternoon attire not only by the judges, but also the public, who shared in 50 percent of the final score. Personality played a large role in the voting as masses of people surrounded each entrant to get to know her better and throw questions at them throughout the event. Later, the entrants were escorted and presented on the stage of the Keith Theatre on the Garden Pier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.missamerica.org/our-miss-americas/1920/1921.aspx | title= Miss America History 1921 | accessdate= 2012-04-13 | deadurl= yes | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120417222234/http://www.missamerica.org/our-miss-americas/1920/1921.aspx | archivedate= 2012-04-17 | df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The amateur prize, the Watkins Trophy, was awarded to [[Miss District of Columbia|Miss Washington, DC]], Margaret Gorman, [[Miss New Jersey|Miss South Jersey]], Kathryn M. Gearon placed second, receiving $100 in gold. A special professional prize, the Endicott Trophy, was awarded to [[Miss New York]], silent film actress Virginia Lee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.missamerica.org/our-miss-americas/1920/1921.aspx | title= Miss America History 1921 | accessdate= 2012-04-13 | deadurl= yes | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120417222234/http://www.missamerica.org/our-miss-americas/1920/1921.aspx | archivedate= 2012-04-17 | df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An immediate hit with the crowds, the "Inter-City Beauties" were later judged head-to-head against two other "Beauty" winners in selected classes of the now famous Bather's Revue: an "amateur winner" from over two hundred local women and tourists, and a "professional winner," which included a field of eleven professional models and actresses. In this extravagant and much-hyped final event, [[Margaret Gorman]] won the Grand Prize: the Golden Mermaid trophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.missamerica.org/our-miss-americas/1920/1921.aspx | title= Miss America History 1921 | accessdate= 2012-04-13 | deadurl= yes | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120417222234/http://www.missamerica.org/our-miss-americas/1920/1921.aspx | archivedate= 2012-04-17 | df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gorman&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fairest In A 1000!| date=1921-09-09|publisher=Spartanburg Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt; decided to enter the contest the following year and, since Washington D.C. had already selected another contestant to represent their area in the 1922 contest, officials allowed Gorman to compete as "Miss America" just two weeks prior to the competition which marks the first time the title was actually used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Maxim Bars Perfume for Girls in Pageant| date=1922-08-29|publisher=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A Row of Beauties in Atlantic City Pageant| date=1921-09-17|publisher=Nevada State Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He had a long history of violent crime, and had been imprisoned for burglary. Hagans was sentenced to life imprisonment for Anna's murder, with a concurrent 10-year sentence for the rape.

Following a campaign by Kay Potts, Anna McGurk's mother, the crime led to changes in English law. [[Michael Stephen]], then MP for Shoreham, moved the Bail (Amendment) Bill, which became the Bail (Amendment) Act 1993. The police and Crown Prosecution Service can now challenge a decision by magistrates to grant bail to an alleged offender.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/gloucestershire/4210928.stm|title=BBC NEWS – UK – England – Gloucestershire – Protest against bail hostel plan|publisher=|accessdate=18 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Anna McGurk Trust, founded in her memory, awards bursaries to pupils of St Peter's High School, where McGurk had been a pupil. There is a small memorial stone in Gloucester.

'''Nina Dotti''' is a character created and interpreted by Venezuelan-born conceptual and performance artist, [[Nina Fuentes]].

== Character profile ==
In her role as Nina Dotti, Fuentes employs a multi-dimensional approach to critically exploring social, cultural and political issues confronting contemporary society.

Dotti was a multimedia, Miami-based contemporary artist. A pioneering artist in her native [[Venezuela]] working for the rights of the [[LGBT community]], she has been described as a feminist artist. Her message is critical, intimate and personal. Her work is neo-conceptual, influenced by [[Marcel Duchamps]], with a pop and surrealistic aesthetic. Her installations are characterized by the use of non-traditional materials and domestic items, making them particularly political.

== Early career ==
Nina was interested in the representation of social stereotypes (especially feminist issues) and the defense of sexual minorities. This gave her the opportunity to assume an artistic alter-ego who would make a blunt statement regarding her identity: Nina Dotti would be her new name, inspired by Italian photographer [[Tina Modotti]], who had to change her identity to work as an artist. This represented an analogy for what Nina had always stood for: equal rights, end of discrimination and the opportunity for people to be whoever they want to be. She signed her new work "Plataforma: Forma de hacer plata" (Money-making Platform) (2005) produced for the "Transito" NGO (2005) and inspired from the [[platform shoes]] used by [[transsexual]]s. That year, Nina performed the streets of Chicago wearing a wedding dress, during which symbolic blessings were given to both [[homosexual]] and [[heterosexual]] couples as a way to express equality.

== Performances, exhibits and installations 2006–2014 ==
[[File:Let it Go the Best is yet to come.jpg|thumb|right|Let it Go the Best is yet to come]]

=== Pastel de Boda (Wedding Cake) ===
"Pastel de Boda" (Wedding Cake) was presented in Miami's Hardcore Art Contemporary Spaces (HACS), in a performance in which Dotti would "marry" her crowd. This was followed by "Hot Flashes Bar", presented during the Arte Americas Art Fair in 2006 where Dotti shared her positive views of [[menopause]] with women in a bar, suggesting humor as a way to replace unhealthy medical treatment like [[hormone replacement therapy]] in what she called Humor Replacement Therapy, thus empowering women to face menopause as a normal part of life and experience a new kind of sexuality. 

Other installations such as The Wedding Cake were presented in the gardens of the International Community Church at [[Lincoln Road]] in [[South Beach]], Miami during the city's [[Art Basel]] 2006. This piece consisted of an immense wedding cake topped with real couples. From here onwards, "Picture Perfect Wedding Toppers" would become her means to express her firm belief that anyone can stand atop a wedding cake and experience life from above, from the most idealistic and [[romance (love)|romantic]] vantage point. The cake had three huge tiers that people climbed up to, "Groom" and "Bride" accessories and wedding rings were available to wear and exchange. Couples from all sexual orientations and entire families climbed up the challenging wooden stairs situated behind the decorated cake. The piece was accompanied by a music piece created in collaboration with Franchesca Saiden and Iris Cegarra with more than 480 wedding songs of all religions and many countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://av.celarg.org.ve/Albumdebodas/portalAlbum.htm CELARG]&lt;/ref&gt; 

In March 2007 she performed at the "Circa '07" art in [[San Juan, Puerto Rico]], in which she received favorable critical reviews with "Blue Pillar Bar", calling it a Celebration of Menopause and Andropause. This was followed by "Dotti's 99 Cent Clichés" presented at Miami's Hard Core Art Space (HCAS), with a kitsch ensemble of the now famous Dollar stores, Dotti mocks consumer frenzy in society.

=== Superwoman ===
Her Superwoman project was based on the [[Supergirl]] [[comics]], transformed into her own interpretation of what a [[superwoman]] should be: "free, capable of living with her complexity in a non-conflictive way". Also in 2006, and as the result of her simultaneous endeavors as art merchant and gallery owner, Nina was invited to exhibit two of her best-known installations "Wedding Cake" and "P.M.S." at Gallerie 13 Jeanette Mariani in Paris. 

Her pieces revealed a three-edged speech symbolized by the three roles a modern woman must juggle simultaneously: a princess to her parents, a mother to her children and a superwoman in front of life. Nina has explored all major artistic disciplines from [[sculpture]] to [[photography]] and from [[mixed media]] to [[painting]]. She uses diverse materials freely on her installations and this pattern is consistent with her attitude towards life, where freedom to choose always prevails. 

In 2008 Nina took part in an exhibition called "Cartografías Meridionales" (Southern Cartography) presented at the Museum of Contemporary Art of Rosario, in the city of Rosario, Argentina, in which her P.M.S. performance was shown again.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.macromuseo.org.ar/archivo/2008/08/cartografias.htm Romer, Marcella. "Cartografias Meridionales" 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Golden Nina ===
By 2012, Nina had expanded her horizons in terms of Plastic Arts. Dot 51 Gallery in Miami was the setting in which her project The Tipping Point&lt;ref&gt;[http://artpulsemagazine.com/nina-dotti-tipping-point. Leyva-Perez, Irina. ARTPULSE Magazine]&lt;/ref&gt; was showcased, presenting a blend of different techniques ranging from video installations to sculpture and photography, all encased in gold, a metaphor for the power of wealth and its impact on everyday life, as expressed on Dotti's series of photographs titled Golden Nina.

=== Doña Delincuente ===
[[File:D Delincuente.png|right|thumb|D Delincuente]]
During one of Dotti's many trips to Colombia, she spoke with her grandmother about her origins. She learned that her great-grandfather owned brothels, that some lands under her family's name are yet to be claimed, as well as learning of her origins as a [[Sephardic Jew]]. This generated an exhibit in the city of Bucaramanga (2014) titled "Doña Delincuente – 13 historias" (Madame Delinquent – 13 Stories),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.senalradiocolombia.gov.co/noticia/do-delincuente-y-el-secreto-de-la-familia-mac. Cristancho, Andres. Señal Radio Colombia. 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; and later her works are represented by Artemisia gallery. This new character created by Nina is inspired by modern Latin American [[Syncretism]] in which criminals are revered as saints, with statues for veneration and prayer, as well as a prayer dedicated to Doña Delincuencia. This captured the attention of the citizens, leading to the production of a brand of drink, as well as a local tobacco brand.

=== Miss Wynwood ===
[[File:Miss Wynwood.png|right|thumb|Miss Wynwood]]
Nina developed a character based on the story of a Venezuelan [[Miss Universe]]-turned-politician called Irene Sáez, who after serving as Mayor of Chacao (Caracas' highest-end municipality), was lured by one of the old establishment parties to oppose [[Hugo Chávez]] only to later be dumped by her party shortly before Election Day. Nina turned herself into a beauty queen elected as the Mayor of Wynwood and walking the streets in a provocative performance called "Miss Wynwood", presented at Miami's [[Art Basel]] 2014 edition.

== Wynwood Times ==
In May 2015, Nina started editing a newspaper, ''The Wynwood Times'' that covers news, art, dining, trends and social issues with humor and irony.

== Depójate ==
In July 2015, Nina took her exhibit Depójate/Take The Load Off to Kiosco Galería in Santa Cruz de La Sierra, Bolivia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eldeber.com.bo/escenas/nina-dotti-y-obra-invita.html Manjón, Adhemar. "Nina Dotti y una obra que invita a olvidar el pasado" Diario El Deber, Bolivia]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Popular culture ==
* On 16 February 2015, [[President Day]], "Nina Fuentes Day" was declared by the Board of [[Miami-Dade]] County Commissioners, recognizing the artist as an "ambassador of the arts" in the South Florida community and accepted by Miss Wynwood during a performance at The Chill Concept, where a copy of the document is buried on the grounds in a time capsule before a live audience.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.diariolasamericas.com/5021_tiempo-libre/2825682_nina-dotti-sera-alcalde-de-wynwood-en-un-performance.html miss wynwood performance]&lt;/ref&gt;

Sgt '''Per Bergsland''' (17 January 1918 – 9 June 1992) was a [[Norwegians|Norwegian]] [[POW]] in the [[Nazi Germany|German]] [[POW camp]] [[Stalag Luft III]] and one of only three men to escape to freedom in the "[[Stalag Luft III#The "Great Escape"|Great Escape]]".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/greatescape/three.html ''The Great Escape - The Three That Got Away''(Nova)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sports career==
During in the 1930s Bergsland competed in [[orienteering]], representing the club [[IL Heming]]. In 1939 he placed second at the individual Norwegian championship in orienteering held at [[Modum]].&lt;ref name=o90&gt;{{cite book |title=Orienteringsidretten i Norge gjennom 90 år |editor1=Berglia, Knut |editor2=Brohaug, Tom-Erik |editor3=Staver, Kristoffer |editor4=Thuesen, Kaare |editor5=Strandhagen, Torgeir |pages=71–76 |year=1987 |language=Norwegian |publisher=[[Norges Orienteringsforbund]] |location=Oslo }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was born in Bærum, but resided at [[Ullern]]åsen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Dagens navn|work=Aftenposten|date=16 January 1988|page=20|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==World War II==
Per Bergsland served as an instructor at flight school in [[Canada]] before he transferred to the [[RAF Ferry Command]], where he was assigned to fly with a combat unit. As a member of [[No. 332 Squadron RAF]] (332 Sqn) stationed at [[North Weald]] airfield, Bergsland's [[Supermarine Spitfire Mk.Vb]], (serial no AB269, coded AH:D) was shot down by a German [[Focke-Wulf Fw 190]] during the [[Dieppe Raid]] on 19 August 1942. After arriving at the POW camp, he gave his name as "Peter Rockland" (''Per'' = [[Petrus (given name)|Petrus]], meaning rock in [[Greek language|Greek]], and ''Berg'' meaning mountain or rock in [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]]), in order to protect his family in Norway from German reprisals.

[[File:Model Stalag Luft III.jpg|thumb|300px|''Stalag Luft III'' mockup.]]

In what later became known as the "Great Escape", he was escapee #43 among the 76 prisoners of war who managed to escape from the camp via tunnel with another Norwegian pilot, escapee #44 [[Jens Müller (pilot)|Jens Müller]],

{{Quote
|text="Bergsland was wearing a civilian suit he had made for himself from a Royal Marine uniform, with an RAF overcoat slightly altered with brown leather sewn over the buttons. A black RAF tie, no hat. He carried a small suitcase which had been sent from Norway. In it were Norwegian toothpaste and soap, sandwiches, and 163 reichsmarks given to him by the Escape Committee.

We caught the 2:04 train to [[Frankfurt an der Oder]]. Our papers stated that we were Norwegian electricians from the Arbeitslager [labor camp] in Frankfurt working in the vicinity of Sagan. For the journey from Frankfurt to [[Stettin]] we had other papers ordering us to change our place of work from Frankfurt to Stettin, and to report to the Birgermeister of Stettin."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/greatescape/three.html ''The Great Escape - The Three That Got Away''(Nova)]&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

Bergsland and Müller made it to the nearby town, where they caught a train to [[Szczecin|Stettin]] in Germany (now: [[Szczecin]], Poland). At the port, the pair were snuck onto a Swedish ship by friendly sailors and made it to the safety of [[Gothenburg]]. There, they met the British consulate, who arranged travel by train to [[Stockholm]], where they were flown to [[Scotland]] from [[Bromma]] airport. From there they were sent by train to [[London]] and shortly afterwards to '[[Little Norway]]' in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.profero.no/littlenorway/Personell_Little_Norway_1940-1945.pdf ''List of personnel associated with Little Norway'' (Edvard Omholt-Jensen "The Spirit of Little Norway" Atheneum. 1986)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In total, only three POWs from Stalag Luft III made it to [[Neutral country|neutral countries]] and freedom. 

The third escapee was the [[Netherlands|Dutchman]] [[Bram van der Stok]], who crossed most of occupied Europe and escaped to Spain with the help of the [[French resistance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/military-obituaries/air-force-obituaries/5648616/Bram-van-der-Stok.html|work=Daily Telegraph|title=Obituary - Bram van der Stok|date=1 July 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The remaining 73 escapees were captured. [[Adolf Hitler]] wanted to [[Execution (legal)|execute]] them all, but [[Hermann Göring]] persuaded him not to: in the end, fifty were shot as an example. The remaining 23 were held in the custody of the [[Gestapo]] before being sent off to other camps. 17 were returned to [[Stalag Luft III]], four were sent to [[Sachsenhausen (detention camp)|Sachsenhausen]], and two to [[Oflag IV-C|Colditz Castle]].

==Postwar career==
In 1946, Per Bergsland began as a pilot in [[Fred Olsen Air Transport]]. He later became Chief Pilot and Operational Manager. Per Bergsland became CEO of [[Fred Olsen Air Transport]] in 1968 and CEO of [[Widerøe]] from 1970 to 1981.

The '''Perkins Opera House''' (also known as the '''Monticello Opera House''') is a historic [[opera house|theatre]] in [[Monticello, Florida]]. It is located at the corner of [[U.S. Route 90 in Florida|Washington Street]] and [[U.S. Route 19 in Florida|Jefferson Street]].

== History ==
The ''Perkins Block'' was built in 1890 by Monticello businessman John H. Perkins.  This building included three first floor bays housing Perkins' mercantile interests - a [[general store]] and sewing machine shop, a [[hardware store]] and a farm implement supply store.  In addition, Perkins built a stable behind the building from which horses, mules and wagons were sold.  The second floor of the Perkins Block included a large foyer and an opera house boasting unparalleled [[acoustics]] and the largest [[Stage (theatre)|stage]] in the region.

Perkins had hopes of establishing the opera house as a major theater in the [[Southern United States|South]]. For several years, performances included both professional touring groups and local productions.  Shortly after the turn of the century, however, the [[railroads]] were re-routed, by-passing Monticello. The wealthy patrons who had once wintered in south Georgia and north Florida sought destinations further south in Florida, and the opera house faced financial disaster.

Unable to attract the once-popular theatre productions, Perkins discontinued live performances.  A failed attempt to utilize the building as a movie theater led to the abandonment of the auditorium.  Although the downstairs bays saw continuous occupation for a variety of uses, the opera house stood idle and soon fell into disrepair.

In 1972, the vision of a handful of interested people saved the opera house, with its falling plaster and leaking roof, from the destruction of the wrecker's ball. An organization was formed to provide opportunities for young performers and restore the opera house.

The Monticello Opera Company was formed in March of that year and performed at the first fund-raising event at the home of Mr. and Mrs. John H. Phipps.

[[File:Monticello opera house02.jpg|thumb|left|The Perkins opera house, seen from the east side]]

The purchase of the Perkins Block was consummated on October 17, 1973.  On that date, the Monticello Opera House, Inc. purchased the building with money raised through fund-raising efforts, a grant from the State of Florida and a private donation from Mrs. Dorothy Simpson, who held one-half interest in the building.

Maintenance and restoration of the facility continues to this day.  In a joint effort with the Florida Department of State, Division of Historic Resources, a restoration project was completed in the area of the original stairway leading to the auditorium balcony.  The construction brought the facility into compliance with fire code regulations to allow the lawful use of seating in the balcony.  The project was completed with a sensitivity to the original architectural features and makes use of original molding and wainscoting wherever possible.  Although the original seating in the balcony remained intact, the seats on the main level of the theater had to be replaced.  The current seating was donated by [[Tallahassee Community College]] President during the school's renovation of its theater.  Installation of the "new" seats was accomplished entirely with volunteer labor from members of the community.

Although the downstairs had been remodeled to accommodate those with disabilities, it was not until May 2004, that the theater became accessible. In 1999 $25,000 was donated in the memory of Dr. Gerald M. Cathey to institute fund raising efforts for installation of an elevator. An additional $25,000 was raised over the course of the next two years through donations from benefactors and production proceeds from the Opera House Stage Company.  A $50,000 matching grant from the Department of State, Division of Historical Resources resulted in the hiring of Riley Palmer Construction to complete this long desired renovation.

==Present usage==

The Monticello Opera House is commonly used for a variety of events including [[children's theater]], [[Mystery dinner|murder mystery dinners]] and large [[musicals]]. There is also a patio and gazebo in the back where weddings and receptions are held.

==Plot==
''Princess Principal'' is set in a fictional analogue of England called [[Albion]]. During the early 20th Century, the Kingdom of Albion monopolized a mysterious substance called "[[Cavorite]]" to construct a fleet of heavily armed airships that made Albion the dominant power in the world. However, the proletariat of Albion grew angry at their country's ruling class for largely ignoring their plight, sparking the "London Revolution" where the lower classes attempted to overthrow the royal family. Eventually, the two sides reached a stalemate, and a great wall was erected through the middle of London, splitting Albion into two nations: the Commonwealth and the Kingdom.

Several years later, the Commonwealth launches "Operation Changeling," a plan to replace the Kingdom's Princess Charlotte with Ange, a girl who bears a strong resemblance to her, in order to have a highly placed agent within the royal family. However, the Princess turns the plan on the spies, offering to work with the Commonwealth if Ange and her friends will help her become the Queen of the Kingdom. So begins the story as five girls, including the Princess herself, serve as undercover spies in the Kingdom working for the Commonwealth, while enrolled as students at the prestigious Queen's Mayfair school.

 |ShortSummary    = Eric, a scientist, seeks to defect to the Commonwealth. Ange and her fellow spies Dorothy, Beatrice, Chise, and Princess smuggle him to safety inside the Queen's Mayfair School,  a prestigious academy where they are posing as students. However, Eric also requests that they bring his little sister Amy as well. Ange and Beatrice go to investigate Amy, and discover that she is suffering from Cavorite poisoning, which requires an expensive procedure to cure. However, after observing several clues and Eric's odd behavior, Ange concludes that Eric is in fact a double agent meant to lure them out into the open. Her suspicions are confirmed when Eric attempts to send a carrier pigeon to his handler. Dorothy, Beatrice, and Chise capture Eric's handler while Ange takes Eric to a secluded park, where she exposes his plan. Eric admits he went to the Duke of Normandy to request the funds to cure Amy, but in return he had to agree to fake his defection. Ange has Eric sign a life insurance policy before executing him. A week later, Eric's body is found and the money from the insurance policy is used to pay for Amy's operation.

 |ShortSummary    = In the past, Ange begins attending Queen's Mayfair school as a transfer student. Ange links up with fellow agent Dorothy; their primary mission is to secretly replace the Princess with Ange. That night, Ange and Dorothy attend a ball at the school and are given an impromptu mission to keep a key away from the Duke of Normandy. Dorothy approaches Morgan, who is in possession of the key, but is turned away by his bodyguards. Ange then goes over to the Princess to befriend her, while "accidentally" spilling a "drink" on her dress. While Princess waits for a new dress, Ange impersonates her to get the key from Morgan. However, Princess is already aware that Ange and Dorothy are spies, and offers to work with them if they help her become Queen of the Kingdom. Ange signals to her handlers to ring a nearby church bell if they accept Princess's terms. The Duke of Normandy realizes the key has been taken from Morgan and orders a search of everyone at the party. As he approaches Ange, the bell tower chimes, distracting the Duke and sealing Ange's bargain with Princess. Princess uses the diversion to secretly take the key from Ange and then excuses herself from the ballroom. The next day, Ange and Princess meet on the roof of the school, revealing that Ange was the one who tipped Princess off to her identity as a spy. It is also revealed that Ange's real name is Charlotte and Princess' real name is Ange, and that both girls had known each other ten years ago.

 |ShortSummary    = It is revealed that Ange became a spy so she could cross the wall and reunite with Princess and smuggle her out of the country. However, Princess tells her that her desire to be Queen was genuine, as she wants to tear down the London Wall and create world where they both can live together without having to hide. Ange agrees to carry out her wish. Ange and Dorothy then receive a mission to board the HMS Gloucester and recover stolen printing plates. They decide to use Princess as way to board the ship, though Beatrice protests her participation in the mission. However, Beatrice's voice becomes odd as she shouts, and she flees in embarrassment. Princess reveals that Beatrice had been experimented on by her father, and her vocal chords were replaced by machinery. With Princess and Dorothy's help, Ange manages to sneak onto the airship, with Beatrice inadvertently following her. Ange assaults the agent transporting the plates but is injured and insists that Beatrice take the plates and leave her behind. Beatrice instead uses her mechanical voice-box to impersonate the agent's voice and call off the guards, giving her and Ange the time to escape together. Realizing that Ange cares as much for Princess as she does, Beatrice decides to join the spy team.

L also warns Dorothy to keep an eye on Princess, as she might be a double agent. Meanwhile, Ange is training Beatrice and Chise when Princess suggests they come up with a name for their team. Dorothy informs them of their mission and they use Princess' status to infiltrate a ceremony at the mine where the Cavorite device is being held. At the ceremony, it is revealed that Chise is there to observe the Kingdom and Commonwealth on the behalf of Japan so it can determine which country to ally with, and the Duke of Normandy wants to marry Princess off to Russia to secure an alliance. Ange searches for the device but finds out it is being transported out of the city by boat. Princess volunteers to assist in the assault on the boat, which convinces Dorothy that she is not a double agent. The team is able to secure the Cavorite device and capture the entire research team. Dorothy relays the results to L, but he warns her that even though Princess may not be a double agent, she will always be a potential threat. At school, the team decides to name themselves Team White Pigeon.

During the train ride to London, a stranger boards the train and Ange and Dorothy confront her, only to find out the stranger is Chise, one of Lord Horikawa's bodyguards who has a personal grudge against Jūbei. Princess has Ange partner up with Chise to get the pair to trust each other more, and Chise reveals she wants to defeat Jūbei since he killed her father. Meanwhile, the Duke of Normandy is secretly working with Jūbei in the hopes that Princess will be caught up in the assassination attempt, since he does not want to risk her ascending the throne. Jūbei and his assassins then attack the train, though Ange and Chise are able to fight them off. Princess and Ange work together to stop the train to prevent a collision with another train, while Chise duels with Jūbei. Chise emerges the victor by killing Jūbei, and Ange deduces that Jūbei was Chise's father. Afterwards, Dorothy introduces Lord Horikawa to Control, and Chise joins the spy team as a new transfer student.

Dorothy asks why she was chosen specifically, and it is revealed that the man tasked by the Duke of Normandy to find the agent's body is Danny MacBean, Dorothy's father. Dorothy (whose real name is revealed to be Daisy), has a tense reunion with her father, who has become an angry and unpleasant man due to the loss of his right hand. She confides to Beatrice that Danny used to be brilliant steam engineer before losing his hand in an accident, and began taking out his anger on everybody around him, including Dorothy, which caused her to run away from home. In a drunken stupor, Danny tells Dorothy how to find the body. She and Beatrice find the body and copy the cipher both so the Duke of Normandy won't be aware of its theft and so that Danny can pay off the loan sharks. While Danny goes to deliver the cipher, the loan sharks attempt to kidnap Dorothy and Beatrice but are easily defeated by Dorothy, and she finds out how far her father was willing to go to protect her from the loan sharks. Meanwhile, Danny attempts to negotiate more money from Gazelle to give to Dorothy, but is killed instead. As Danny's body is taken to the morgue, Dorothy and Beatrice wait for him at his favorite pub.

 |ShortSummary    = The team is tasked with tracking down a serial killer dubbed "Poison Gas Jack", who is using nerve gas to assassinate people who are sympathetic to the Commonwealth. They surmise that the killer is a soldier stationed at a base that stores stocks of nerve gas. Knowing that they can find the killer by finding nerve gas residue on his clothes, the team infiltrates the local laundry mill that services the base, but quickly find that efficiency is poor due to poorly maintained equipment and sloppy layout. In addition, the laundry mill is deeply in debt and on the verge of closing, threatening the mission. Princess decides to purchase the laundry mill and its debt, and the team goes about fixing and rearranging the machinery, which vastly increases efficiency and productivity. Meanwhile, the killer's uniform is inadvertently sent to the laundry mill, and he heads there to recover it. Princess finds his uniform and discovers his true identity, while Chise knocks him out. With their mission done, Princess steps down as the laundry mill's foreman and promotes Marilla, the most veteran laundry mill worker, to take her place. Despite leaving, the team is confident that the laundry mill workers will be able to take care of themselves from now on.

 |ShortSummary    = The team must keep surveillance on Lord O'Reilly in order to find out the identity of the mysterious person he is meeting in secret. While the other team members keep watch from a hotel room, Ange poses as an artist outside O'Reilly's hotel. While on her post, Ange sees an impoverished girl named Julie who unsuccessfully tries to pickpocket people. Feeling pity for Julie, Ange teaches her how to properly pickpocket. She then tells Julie her past, veiled as a fairy tale. Ten years ago, Ange was the real Princess, who had quickly gotten bored with her dull and sheltered life. One day, she discovered a crack in the castle wall where she met Princess, the real Ange, who was a poor pickpocket at the time and looked identical to her. They both quickly became friends. Eventually, Ange grew curious about life outside the castle, and switched places with Princess, and quickly discovered the poor living conditions of the rest of the country. Back in the present, with Julie's help, Ange figures out that O'Reilly's contact is Gazelle. In return, Ange frees Julie from her abusive guardian and helps enroll her into an orphanage. Ange finishes her story, where both she and Princess were separated after the Revolution, and how Princess had to live in constant fear of discovery for ten years. Meanwhile, Princess meets O'Reilly and warns him that Gazelle is attempting to trick him defecting to the Commonwealth to trap him, and offers her help instead. Afterwards, Ange admits to Princess that she considers her the true Princess now due to her dream to change Albion for the better. The two then play piano together like they used to do as children.

 |ShortSummary    = Chise writes a letter to her sister back in Japan, telling her about her new life in Albion as well as being part of Princess' spy team. For most of the day, she attends regular school activities, though her differing cultural values make her appear odd to her classmates. Chise is also wary of Lily Gaveston, one of Princess' classmates who has connections to the Duke of Normandy and is possibly spying on them. After school, Chise participates in spy missions with Ange, Dorothy, and Beatrice, though she feels insecure about the fact that her fighting skills aren't always needed. She also regularly reports to Lord Horikawa, who wants to know whether Princess' plan to become Queen will succeed so he knows whether to side with the Kingdom or the Commonwealth. One day, Chise is admiring a butterfly when another student, Cameron, arrogantly kills it in front of her and then insults Japan. Incensed, Chise attempts to challenge Cameron to a duel but Princess intervenes. Rather than stop Chise, Princess teaches Chise the rules for a Western-style duel and helps arrange it, nominating Lily to be the witness. Chise and Cameron use antique pistols for the duel, but Chise quickly finds out that her gun has been sabotaged, so she instead uses her necktie as a makeshift sling to injure Cameron and intimidate him into apologizing. The rest of the spy team celebrate Chise's victory, and reveal that they also used the duel as a distraction to sneak into Lily's room to tap the phone she uses to report to the Duke of Normandy. In her next report to Lord Horikawa, Chise admits that she's not sure if Princess will succeed, but she genuinely wants her to.

 |ShortSummary    = Ange, Dorothy, and Beatrice are sent on a mission to steal secret documents from the First Lord of the Admiralty. They gain assistance from the inside by another Commonwealth agent, Prefect, who was trained in the same class as Ange and Dorothy. During the mission, Beatrice learns that Prefect always ended up being second best to Ange, and the two don't get along because of that rivalry. The mission ends up being a success, and the group celebrates at a pub. Ange and Beatrice leave early while Prefect and Dorothy reminisce about their final exam where, believing that they had failed the exam, Dorothy took Prefect to a local carnival to have some fun. Meanwhile, Ange takes Beatrice to Prefect's room, revealing that Control suspects Prefect is a double agent. Ange deliberately triggers one of Prefect's traps, causing her to flee and confirming the team's suspicions. Prefect is able to evade Ange and reach a train, but Dorothy catches up to her and holds her at gunpoint. Prefect admits that she was poisoned and forced to work for the enemy in return for the cure, and that the woman she looked up the most to and wished to be was in fact Dorothy, not Ange. Prefect then commits suicide so as to spare Dorothy the task of executing her. Ange and Dorothy return to Control to report their success when they discover that L has been replaced by a new superior, General. General congratulates them and then tasks them with a new mission: assassinate Princess.

 |ShortSummary    = Ange and Dorothy reluctantly accept General's mission and return to the school. Dorothy lets Ange go on ahead since she cannot accept having to kill Princess. Ange approaches Princess' room and finds out that Control has assigned a new team to act as her bodyguards, led by a new agent named Zelda. Ange realizes that Control no longer trusts her, as Dorothy and Chise are reassigned and replaced with new agents. Ange secretly meets with Seven, who warns her that the military has seized control of operation and put its own plan in motion. Zelda then instructs Ange to carry out the assassination on Princess in order to prove her loyalty. Ange leads Princess to a nearby airport, where she causes a distraction and both of them switch appearances to confuse Zelda's agents and escape. Ange leads Princess to a departing airship and tells her that they will be running away to [[Casablanca]]. Princess however refuses to leave since she is still dedicated to her dream to become Queen and reform the Kingdom. She locks Ange in the airship's cargo hold and returns to Zelda, posing as Ange. Zelda explains to the disguised Princess that they will use her as a symbol to rally rebellious soldiers in the Royal Army and stage a coup to kill the current Queen and replace her with the fake Princess.

Back on the airship, Ange manages to escape and return to the school, where she finds Dorothy and Beatrice waiting for her. Dorothy reveals she was given a separate mission from the Commonwealth government to stop General and Zelda's plan. The three of them head to the Royal Cathedral, where they are quickly cornered by Gazelle and contingent of soldiers. Chise provides a distraction for them to escape and proceed to the Cathedral. Meanwhile, Princess tries to convince the rebel soldiers not to go through the assassination, promising them that she will become the next and last queen to reform the Kingdom. Zelda shoots Princess in an attempt to keep her quiet and is prepared to kill her right when Ange and Chise arrive. Ange takes Princess to safety while Chise chases Zelda off and Dorothy and Beatrice throw smoke bombs into the cathedral crowd to force them to evacuate. In the aftermath, the Duke of Normandy finds Princess' hat, causing him to suspect her involvement. Back at Control, L returns and removes General from his post before asking where the Principal Team is. It is revealed that they are taking a vacation in [[Casablanca]] before they are given a new mission.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1780">'''Red Bull Paper Wings''' is a world [[paper airplane]] championship which is held by [[Red Bull]] under the rules developed by the [[Paper Aircraft Association]] (PAA). The competition was first held in 2006. Contestants from 99 countries from around the world qualified for the 2009 competition. The third Red Bull Paper Wings world finals took place on May 4–5, 2012. The final round of the competition takes place in Red Bull's [[Hangar 7]] in [[Salzburg]], [[Austria]], and is monitored by [[Guinness Book of World Records]] officials.

The competition crowns champions in three categories: distance, hangtime, and aerobatics.

The two-time defending champion of the Paper Wings Distance competition is Ronin Ivan from [[Split, Croatia]].

Historically, the representatives from the United States do poorly despite having fifteen representatives relative to the three from every other country.  This trend has been questioned for the 2012 competition as John Hart was the 7th ceded player in the distance competition.  In the first event in 2006, Randy Fischer (Team USA West) placed 5th in the hangtime competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Red Bull PaperWings 2012|work=[[Indo-Asian News Service]]|publisher=[[Hindustan Times]]|date=4 May 2012|url=http://www.redbullpaperwings.com/en/news/red-bull-paper-wings-2012-hangar-7-salzburg-austria|accessdate=5 May 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120506180414/http://www.redbullpaperwings.com/en/news/red-bull-paper-wings-2012-hangar-7-salzburg-austria|archivedate=6 May 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Camp Crame, 2013–2016===
After serving as Davao City Police Chief, Dela Rosa was assigned to the national headquarters of the Philippine National Police in [[Camp Crame]] where he worked for the PNP Intelligence Group from October 2013 to December 2014.&lt;ref name="pdi" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Rappler /&gt;&lt;ref name="command"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Alvarez|first1=Kathrina Charmaine|title='Bato' Dela Rosa assumes command of PNP|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/571996/news/nation/bato-dela-rosa-assumes-command-of-pnp|accessdate=7 February 2017|publisher=''GMA News''|date=July 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Dela Rosa became a member of the PNP Board of Inquiry which investigated the [[Mamasapano clash]].

Dela Rosa also served as the  executive officer of the Directorate for Human Resource and Doctrine Development (HRDD).&lt;ref name="pdi" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Rappler /&gt;&lt;ref name="command" /&gt;

A few days before the [[Philippine general election, 2016|May 9, 2016 Philippine general election]], Dela Rosa was relieved as brigade commander of the Reactionary Standby Support Force (RSSF) of the Philippine National Police allegedly due to his [[Facebook]] posts seen to be in favor of then presidential candidate [[Rodrigo Duterte]]. A Facebook status posted on May 1, 2016 which had gone [[Viral phenomenon|viral]] read: {{quote|I am the Brigade Commander of the PNP RSSF composed of 8 battalions close to 5,000 personnel based in Camp Crame. ''Kayong mga mangdadaya at mangliligalig ngayong'' ("those who would cheat and terrorize on the") May 9 elections, ''humanda na kayo'' ("be warned")! WE WILL CRUSH YOU!!!}} Another Facebook post dated April 26, 2016 said: {{quote|It’s time for Batman vs Emilio Aguinaldo. Who will win? The fictional superhero or the real Filipino hero?}} During the [[PiliPinas Debates 2016 – Luzon leg]], the  third and final presidential debate, Duterte said that his main campaign donor was [[Emilio Aguinaldo]], while [[Liberal Party (Philippines)|Liberal Party]] standard-bearer [[Mar Roxas]] quoted [[Batman]]. However, Dela Rosa's commanding officer at that time, PNP deputy chief for operations Deputy Director General Danilo Constantino, denied that Dela Rosa's Facebook posts were the main reasons why he was relieved of his duty. According to [[Police rank#Philippines|Deputy Director General]] Constantino, [[Police rank#Philippines|Chief Superintendent]] Dela Rosa was relieved from the Reactionary Standby Support Force (RSSF) so that he could focus on his responsibilities as executive officer of the PNP Directorate for Human Resource and Doctrine Development (HRDD). Nonetheless, Constantino stated that the PNP Internal Affairs Service will investigate Dela Rosa's Facebook posts for possible administrative liabilities as the officers of the Philippine National Police are required to be neutral and apolitical during the elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mellejor/Carillo|first1=Ayan/Lovely|title=Davao’s The Rock ‘bato’ and Vin Diesel  Gen.

"'''Sinclairvisan'''" or "'''Sinclairsvisan'''" ("The Sinclair Song") is a [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[propaganda song]] with 90 verses, written by [[Anders Odel]] in 1739 to the "[[La Folia]]" melody. The song describes the murder of the Swedish [[diplomat]], ''[[friherre]]'', and [[major]] [[Malcolm Sinclair (Swedish nobleman)|Malcolm Sinclair]]. Sinclair was murdered in 1739, while on a diplomatic mission, by two Russian officers acting on orders from the Russian government.

==Synopsis==
The song is narrated by the shepherd Celadon, who describes how he is brought by a "strange old man" into the [[Elysium|Elysian Fields]]. He watches as the murdered Sinclair enters a great castle, where he is greeted by 12 kings ("twelve Swedish Carls", i.e. [[Mythological kings of Sweden|Charles I]]–[[Charles XII of Sweden|XII]]), to whom he relates the circumstances of his death.

==Authorship==
The song is included as an uncharacteristic entry in [[Erik Gustaf Geijer]] and [[Arvid August Afzelius]]'s influential folk song collection ''[[Svenska folk-visor från forntiden]]''. According to the authors, the song was popularly held to have been penned by [[Jacob Henrik Mörk]], author of ''Adelriks och Giöthildas äfwentyr'' (1742-44), until a draft of the song was found among Odel's manuscripts. They also note that older publications of the song include an epilogue, in which the ''A'' and ''O'' in "Celadon" are emphasized, hinting at the author's initials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Geijer |first1=Erik Gustaf |author-link1=Erik Gustaf Geijer |last2=Afzelius |first2=Arvid August |author-link2=Arvid August Afzelius |year=1814 |chapter=Malcom Sinclair |chapter-url=https://archive.org/stream/svenskafolkviso02geijgoog#page/n272/mode/2up |title=Svenska folk-visor från forntiden |url= |dead-url= |format= |language=Swedish |volume=1 |location=Stockholm |publisher=Strinnholm och Häggström |publication-date= |pages=220-243 |oclc=23555964 |archive-url= |archive-date= |access-date= 15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Strikeforce: Cormier vs. Mir''''' was a planned [[mixed martial arts]] event that was to be held by [[Strikeforce (mixed martial arts)|Strikeforce]]. The event was scheduled to take place on November 3, 2012 at the [[Chesapeake Energy Arena]] in [[Oklahoma City, Oklahoma]].&lt;ref name="sf1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mmajunkie.com/news/30489/strikeforce-heads-to-oklahoma-city-for-daniel-cormier-vs-frank-mir.mma|title=USA TODAY: Strikeforce heads to Oklahoma City for Daniel Cormier vs. Frank Mir|publisher=MMAjunkie.com|date=2012-09-03|accessdate=2012-09-03|last=Morgan|first=John|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121108025752/http://mmajunkie.com/news/30489/strikeforce-heads-to-oklahoma-city-for-daniel-cormier-vs-frank-mir.mma|archivedate=2012-11-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sf2"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.mmafighting.com/2012/9/3/3289620/first-ufc-vs-strikeforce-match-looks-to-be-early-november-in-oklahoma |title=Strikeforce: Mir vs. Cormier Heavyweights |publisher=MMAFighting.com |date=2012-09-03 |accessdate=2012-09-03 |last=Meltzer |first=Dave}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The main event was expected to be see Strikeforce Heavyweight Grand Prix champion [[Daniel Cormier]] face former UFC Heavyweight Champion [[Frank Mir]].&lt;ref name="sf1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sf2"/&gt; However, Mir was forced to withdraw due to injury. Though fellow UFC fighters [[Matt Mitrione]] (who declined the fight) &amp; [[Pat Barry (fighter)|Pat Barry]] were possible replacements for Mir,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mmajunkie.com/news/30688/frank-mir-injured-out-of-strikeforce-heavyweight-fight-against-daniel-cormier.mma|title=Frank Mir injured, out of Strikeforce heavyweight fight against Daniel Cormier|publisher=MMAjunkie.com|date=2012-09-19|accessdate=2012-09-19|last=Marrocco|first=Steven}}&lt;/ref&gt; the bout was eventually cancelled. The Cormier/Mir bout would eventually take place at [[UFC on Fox: Henderson vs. Melendez]] in April 2013, following Strikeforce's closure and Cormier's signing with the UFC. In the rescheduled match-up, Cormier won by unanimous decision.

A middleweight championship bout between champion [[Luke Rockhold]] and [[Lorenz Larkin]] was originally scheduled for this event,&lt;ref name="staff"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ufc.com/news/SF5-venue-news|title=Strikeforce Heads to OKC with Cormier vs. Mir, Rockhold vs. Larkin November 3|publisher=UFC.com|date=2012-09-04|author=staff}}&lt;/ref&gt; but was called off due to an injury to Rockhold. The bout was rescheduled for the promotion's last event [[Strikeforce: Marquardt vs. Saffiedine]] in January 2013, but both Rockhold and Larkin were replaced by [[Ronaldo Souza]] and UFC middleweight [[Ed Herman (mixed martial artist)|Ed Herman]] due to their own respective injuries.

On October 12, 2012, Strikeforce announced it was cancelling this event, the second in a row. Injuries to headliner Frank Mir, as well as co-headliner and middleweight champion [[Luke Rockhold]] were cited as the deciding factors for the cancellation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mmajunkie.com/news/31099/strikeforce-cancels-nov-3-event-in-oklahoma-city-plans-january-return.mma|title=Strikeforce cancels Nov. 3 event in Oklahoma City, plans January return|publisher=MMAjunkie.com|date=2012-10-12|last=Stupp|first=Dann|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121109000532/http://mmajunkie.com/news/31099/strikeforce-cancels-nov-3-event-in-oklahoma-city-plans-january-return.mma|archivedate=2012-11-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the cancellation, the bout between [[Tim Kennedy (fighter)|Tim Kennedy]] &amp; [[Trevor Smith (fighter)|Trevor Smith]] was rescheduled for [[Strikeforce: Marquardt vs. Saffiedine]] in January 2013, where Kennedy won via third round submission.

The '''Teatro Argentino de La Plata''' is the second most important lyric [[List of opera houses|opera house]] in Argentina, after the [[Teatro Colón]] in [[Buenos Aires]]. The theatre is located in a central block of the city of [[La Plata]], the capital of [[Buenos Aires Province]]. The venue occupies the block bounded by the 9 and 10 streets and 51 &amp; 53 avenues; it belongs to the ''Monumental Axis'' of public buildings in La Plata. 

==The original building==

The original building was a classic Italian opera house, conceived in renaissance style by the Italian architect [[Leopoldo Rocchi]]. Construction began in 1887, five years after the foundation of the city of [[La Plata]] itself. The main hall had a capacity of ''ca.'' 1,500 seats. It was inaugurated on November 19, 1890, with [[Giuseppe Verdi]]'s ''[[Otello]]''; in leading roles were the Italian soprano [[Elvira Colonnese]] (Desdemona) and the Uruguayan tenor [[José Oxilia]] (Othello).
The theatre grew to accommodate a renowned stable orchestra and chorus. A stable ballet company was added in 1946. Among the great artists that performed at the Teatro Argentino we find singers such as [[Maria Barrientos]], [[Luisa Tetrazzini]], [[Marian Anderson]], [[Emma Carelli]], [[Fedora Barbieri]], [[Tito Schipa]], [[Beniamino Gigli]], [[Titta Ruffo]],  and [[Mario del Monaco]], classical ballet dancers such as [[Anna Pavlova]], [[Dore Hoyer]] and [[Iris Scaccheri]], as well as musicians such as [[Pietro Mascagni]], [[Richard Strauss]] (with the [[Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra]]), [[Arthur Rubinstein]], [[Andrés Segovia]], [[Alexander Brailowsky]], [[Claudio Arrau]], [[Pablo Casals]], and [[Yehudi Menuhin]].

==The New Building==

Unfortunately, a major fire destroyed the original building in 1977, leaving only the badly damaged exterior walls standing. Against national and international outcry, the ''de facto'' government of the military dictatorship at the time (the so-called ''[[Proceso de Reorganizacion Nacional]]'') decided against rebuilding the original classic structure. Instead, it chose to replace it with a massive Theatre &amp; Cultural Centre designed in a [[brutalist]] style, located on the same city block. During the intervening years (1977–1999), the Teatro Argentino companies continued to produce performances in various La Plata venues, notably the former [[movie theatre]], the Cine Gran Rocha. After much planning and rescheduling due to economic difficulties, the new building was finished and inaugurated on October 12, 1999 with a performance that included excerpts from works of [[Giuseppe Verdi]], [[Charles Gounod]], [[Umberto Giordano]] and [[Gaetano Donizetti]], as well as the ballet ''Tango en gris'' ("Tango in grey"), with music by [[Atilio Stampone]] and ''régie'' by [[Oscar Araiz]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clarin.com/diario/1999/10/13/e-04001d.htm Gala Night in the Return of the Teatro Argentino de La Plata] ''Clarin'' newspaper {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lanacion.com.ar/Archivo/Nota.asp?nota_id=157229 Dance and Opera for a Historic Day] ''La Nacion'' newspaper {{es}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The new complex includes today a 2,000-seat operatic venue with a typical European horseshoe structure, named [[Alberto Ginastera]] Hall after the famous Argentine composer. An enormous three-tonne bronze chandelier with 400 light-bulbs hangs over the main floor, in an exact replica of the one featured in the original building.

The complex also includes the smaller 300-seat [[Ástor Piazzolla]] Hall, as well as rehearsal areas, and space for the associated technical shops. The lower level includes the [[Emilio Pettoruti]] Exhibition Hall for permanent and transient art collections.

Despite the excellent technical facilities and the superb acoustics of the main hall, the complex itself, built in [[brutalist]] style, continues to be regarded as a sort of eyesore by the local population.&lt;ref&gt;“El Teatro Argentino: La construcción actual perdió el estilo de la obra original]” Diario Hoy, 24 October 2003, 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5177">The '''Texas Shakespeare Festival''' is a professional summer theatre housed in the Anne Dean Turk Fine Arts Center on the campus of [[Kilgore College]], [[Kilgore, Texas]]. TSF presents four weeks of performances during late June and July of five productions in [[repertory]]: two plays by [[Shakespeare]], a classic, a musical, and a children's show.

==History==
Established in 1986, the Texas Shakespeare Festival began as Kilgore College's contribution to the Texas [[Sesquicentennial]] celebration.&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt; The brainchild of Raymond Caldwell, a faculty member within the theatre program at Kilgore College and subsequent Artistic Director of the Festival,&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/05/theater/newsandfeatures/05calh.html|title=Don't Mess with Shakespeare|accessdate=2008-02-22|date=2005-06-05|author=Ada Calhoun|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; the first season of TSF consisted of two plays by Shakespeare and ''The Daisy Bradford 3'', a regional work commissioned for the celebration telling the story of the East Texas oil boom by Gifford Wingate, all performed by a small company of professional actors. The overwhelming popularity and quality of the summer theatre experience for the people of East Texas catapulted what was to have been a one-time event into an organization that is celebrating its second decade of performances.
More than 1000 theatre artists have worked at TSF including such well-known personalities as [[Michael C. Hall]] (''[[Six Feet Under (TV series)|Six Feet Under]]''; ''[[Dexter (TV series)|Dexter]]''); [[Danny Pino]] (''[[Cold Case]]''); [[Glenn Fleshler]] (''[[Spring Awakening (musical)|Spring Awakening]]''; ''[[Guys and Dolls]]''); Rick Holmes (''[[Spamalot]]''); Andrew Samonsky (''[[South Pacific (musical)|South Pacific]]''; ''[[Tick, Tick... Boom!]]''); [[Glenn Kessler (screenwriter)|Glenn Kessler]] (Creator, Producer, Director and Actor for ''[[Damages (TV series)|Damages]]''); and [[Keythe Farley]] (co-author, ''[[Bat Boy: The Musical]]'').

The Texas Shakespeare Festival is listed as a Major Festival in the book ''Shakespeare Festivals Around the World'' by Marcus D. Gregio ([[editing|Editor]]), 2004.

===Productions===
In more than twenty years, the Texas Shakespeare Festival has produced twenty-nine plays of Shakespeare’s canon, as well as multiple American and European classics, original works, numerous musicals, and very successful shows for young audiences. Their work with young audience led to them being awarded a grant in 2005 to further support youth activities.&lt;ref name="grant"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kilgorenewsherald.com/news/2005/0617/Front_Page/001.html|title=Texas Shakespeare Festival Receives Grant|accessdate=2008-02-22|date=2005-06-17|work=Kilgore News Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Festival continues to audition and employ professional directors, actors, designers, and technicians, as well as giving many university students from all across America their first summer theatre experience. The Festival has attracted a range of attention throughout its more than two-decades of performances. In 1999 a production of ''[[Angels in America: A Gay Fantasia on National Themes|Angels in America]]'' produced by the Kilgore College Theatre Department and directed by Caldwell, led to death threats, [[LGBT rights opposition|anti-gay]] protests and a withdrawal of more than $50,000 in funding by the [[Gregg County]] Commissioners. Subsequently, however, the Festival received grants from both [[Paul Newman]]'s Own PEN Center, the Dramatists Guild of America, and other sympathetic sources nationwide.&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt;

==Support==
Kilgore College provides the majority of the funding for the Festival, and provides a range of other support for the festival including: rehearsal facilities, office spaces, the [[Van Cliburn]] Auditorium, dormitory housing and meals for the entire company, scholarships for the apprentices, printing, publicity and public relations. Additional grants and foundations enable the Texas Shakespeare Festival to continue as a strong and vital cultural asset and tourist attraction for all of [[East Texas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Plot==
In 1940, the [[Nazis]] invade the Netherlands. [[Miep Gies]] is a young woman, and an office assistant of [[Otto Frank]], who is [[Jewish]]. As the Nazis begin to kill the Jews, Otto Frank becomes worried about his family. In July 1942, Otto Frank decides to hide his family after his daughter [[Margot Frank|Margot]] is called to appear for transport to a Nazi labor camp. Miep, who is trusted by Otto, hides them in the attic above the office, that was called [[Anne Frank House|The Annexe]]. The film tells the true story of Gies' struggle to keep the family hidden and safe, as the Nazis turn Amsterdam upside-down.

A few days later, the van Daans join the Franks in hiding, and after some months [[Fritz Pfeffer|Albert Dussel]], a Jewish dentist, joins them in hiding. Miep, her husband [[Jan Gies]], along with Miep's fellow office workers [[Victor Kugler|Mr Kraler]], [[Johannes Kleiman|Mr Koophuis]], and [[Bep Voskuijl|Elli]] actively helps the innocent Jews to hide. Miep is never able to keep these hiders out of her thoughts, and she does her best to protect them. But all her efforts are destroyed on August 4, 1944. The [[Gestapo]] is informed about the hiders, and they come to the building to arrest them. Mr Kraler and Mr Koophuis are arrested with the hiders, while Miep is spared because she is [[Austrians|Austrian]] (which was pro-Nazi since the [[Anschluss]] took over in 1938, the year before the war started as it is German-speaking and the birthplace of [[Hitler]]) as well as a [[Gentile]], and [[Karl Silberbauer]], the Gestapo officer who arrested the hiders, was also an Austrian Gentile. So, out of mercy, Silberbauer spares Miep. After the arrest, Miep and Jan go to the annex, and Miep finds [[Anne Frank]]'s diary in the floor of Anne's room, and she collects it before the Annex is emptied by the Nazis. A day later, Miep decides to bribe Silberbauer in return of her friends, but Silberbauer denies. The war is finished a few months later, and Otto Frank safely returns to Amsterdam. Miep and Jan shelter him. Otto tells Miep that [[Edith Frank|Mrs Frank]] had died in the [[Auschwitz]] concentration camp, and [[Hermann van Pels|Mr van Daan]] was gassed by the Nazis in Auschwitz. However, Anne, Margot and [[Auguste van Pels|Mrs van Daan]] were sent to the [[Bergen-Belsen concentration camp|Bergen-Belsen]] concentration camp, which was not a death camp, and Otto has high hopes for them. But a few days later, a letter comes to Otto informing him that Anne and Margot died in Bergen-Belsen. Otto tells Miep, who is distraught. Miep takes Anne's diary, which she has not read, from her drawer and gives it to Otto Frank. While Otto reads Anne's diary, Miep goes to Anne's room in the hiding place, and sits in a chair. She then leaves the building, and the films ends with her cycling home, as we hear her speak in a voice-over.

'''''W*A*L*T*E*R''''' is a failed 1984 [[television pilot]] for a [[spin-off (media)|spin-off]] of ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]'' that was never picked up. It starred [[Gary Burghoff]], who reprised his ''M*A*S*H'' character.

The episode relates the adventures of [[List of M*A*S*H characters#Radar O.27Reilly|Corporal Walter "Radar" O'Reilly]] after he returns home from the [[Korean War]]. He is no longer calling himself "Radar" and has moved away from [[Iowa]] after he sent his mother to live with his aunt. Settling in [[St. Louis, Missouri]], by the beginning of the series he has become a police officer, though his character is still as in the original series.&lt;ref&gt;David Scott Diffrient, ''M*A*S*H'' ([[Wayne State University Press]], 2008), {{ISBN|978-0814335529}}, p. 142.

The episode opens with Walter O'Reilly in his cousin Wendell Micklejohn's apartment. They are getting ready for their workday while watching the start of a television interview. The interview shows journalist [[Clete Roberts]] following up on the members of the M*A*S*H 4077th.  The previous week Roberts had interviewed [[Hawkeye Pierce]], and this week he is catching up with O'Reilly. At the police department and through store windows on the street, O'Reilly and Micklejohn catch pieces of the television interview, giving viewers of the pilot a chance to sample the potential series and to build a bridge between the events of ''M*A*S*H'' and ''W*A*L*T*E*R''.

Viewers learn that O'Reilly returned to [[Iowa]], where he failed at farming. He sold the farm and the livestock and sent his mother off to live with his aunt. His bride left him for another man during their honeymoon. O'Reilly decided to commit suicide, and went to a drug store to buy sleeping pills for an overdose (as well as aspirin, because sleeping pills give him headaches). The drugstore clerk, Victoria, cheered him up and they became good friends. His cousin Wendell helped him get a job on the police force. Walter solves a dispute between two strippers, and gets his wallet back from a young would-be thief whose father had died in Korea.&lt;ref name=" Best Care Anywhere "&gt;{{cite web|url =http://www.bestcareanywhere.net/walter.htm|title =W*A*L*T*E*R|accessdate = 2013-08-21|date = 2006-06-02|publisher = Best Care Anywhere }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Timeline===
The episode takes place after the series finale of ''M*A*S*H'', and a two part guest appearance on ''[[AfterMASH]]'', in which Radar was forced to leave the family farm.

===Broadcast difficulties===
Since the pilot was never picked up by [[CBS]] as a series, it was shown as a "CBS [[Television special|Special]] Presentation" on July 17, 1984. It was shown once in the Eastern and [[Central time zone]]s of the United States, but pre-empted on the West Coast by [[CBS News]] coverage of the [[1984 Democratic National Convention|Democratic National Convention]].

The inaugural event in 2003 was organised by the IWCC and branded as the '''IWCC Trophy'''. The IWCC was subsumed by the [[International Cricket Council]] (ICC) in 2005, and all other editions have been known simply as the World Cup Qualifier. The number of teams and qualifying places has varied at each tournament – in 2003, six teams competed for two qualifying spots, while at the next edition (in 2008) eight teams contested two qualifying spots. The 2011 event saw ten teams compete for three qualifying places, and the 2017 tournament featured ten teams and four qualifying places.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/cricket/28158473 |title=World Cup 2017: Women's Championship will form qualifying |accessdate=30 June 2015 |work=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{UDP|date=January 2018}}'''The Yidan Prize''' (/ji: ‘dan/） is an educational prize founded in 2016 by [[Chen Yidan|Dr. Charles Chen]]. The prize is awarded each year to two individuals or organizations whose work has made profound contributions to education [[research]] and development. The prize comprises two categories: the Yidan Prize for Education Research, which recognizes outstanding research that makes significant contributions to education, and the Yidan Prize for Education Development, which recognizes innovative ideas that tackle pressing challenges in the field of education.

The prize is financed and governed by a HK$2.5 billion (about US$320 million) independent trust. Each prize carries an award of HK$30 million (about US$3.87 million)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-38639891|title=Chinese billionaire offers biggest education prize - BBC|website=www.bbc.com|access-date=2017-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; – half cash award and half project fund – as well as a gold medal. Through a series of initiatives, the prize serves to provide a platform that allows the global community to engage in conversation around education and to play a role in education philanthropy.

Nominees can be either individuals or teams of up to three representatives, who can be teachers, researchers, academics, policy makers and advocates among others. The two independent judging panels will screen valid nominations and select a candidate for each prize category. Candidates are assessed on four criteria: [[future orientation]], [[innovation]], transformation and [[sustainability]].

The Yidan Prize unveiled its inaugural laureates on 19 September 2017 in [[Hong Kong]]. They are [[Carol Dweck|Carol S. Dweck]] of Stanford University and [[Vicky Colbert]],&lt;ref&gt;https://ie-today.co.uk/Article/carol-dweck-and-vicky-colbert-win-largest-education-prize&lt;/ref&gt; founder and director of Fundación Escuela Nueva. At the inaugural Yidan Prize Award Presentation Ceremony and the Yidan Prize Summit, they shared their ground-breaking work in education.

== The Worldwide Educating for the Future Index ==
On September 19, 2017, the Yidan Prize Foundation launched the first Worldwide Educating for the Future Index. The index was commissioned by the Yidan Prize Foundation and conducted by the [[Economist Intelligence Unit]]. It evaluates how 35 developed and developing economies, representing 88% of global GDP and 77% of global population, are preparing the next generation with the skills needed for the future. The index is based on 16 indicators across three thematic categories: education policy, teaching environment and socio-economic environment. It's the world’s first ever comprehensive benchmarking tool that focuses on inputs to education systems, as opposed to outputs such as test scores. The index examines the strengths and weaknesses of education systems for the next generation and creates a blueprint for governments to improve.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/edtechresearcher/2017/10/a_blueprint_for_the_future_of_education_-_the_worldwide_educating_for_the_future_index.html|title=The Worldwide Educating for the Future Index - A Blueprint for Change|website=www.edweek.org|access-date=2017-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Teatro Zorrilla''' or '''Zorrilla Theatre''', also known as the '''''Duláang Zorrilla sa Maynila''''' ("Zorrilla Theater in Manila") in [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]], was a prominent theatre in the [[Philippines]]. Once located along Calle Iris (now a part of [[C.M. Recto Avenue]]), [[Manila]], the theatre was named after [[José Zorrilla]] (1817 - 1893), a [[Spanish people|Spanish]] poet and playwright. The building, which had a seating capacity of 900 people, was officially opened on 17 August 1893, and it was the venue for [[Spanish-language]] and Tagalog-language stage performances.&lt;ref name=Retrato&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.retrato.com.ph/photodtl.asp?id=AR00382 |title=Zorrilla Theater |publisher=Filipinas Heritage Library (A Division of Ayala Foundation, Inc.), Retrato.com |accessdate=19 June 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722141049/http://www.retrato.com.ph/photodtl.asp?id=AR00382 |archivedate=July 22, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
