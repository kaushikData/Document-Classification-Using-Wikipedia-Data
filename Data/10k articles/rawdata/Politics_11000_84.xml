{{Politics of Ukraine}}
The '''2006 Parliamentary crisis in [[Ukraine]]''' started in March 2006 as a result of inconclusive [[Ukrainian parliamentary election, 2006|parliamentary elections]], and ended on 3 August 2006 with [[Viktor Yanukovych]] (as part of the [[Alliance of National Unity]]) being chosen as a [[Prime Minister of Ukraine|Prime Minister]] to replace [[Yuriy Yekhanurov]], who resigned right after the parliamentary elections.

Many speculated that [[Bloc Yulia Tymoshenko]] (BYuT) might form a coalition with [[Our Ukraine (political party)|Our Ukraine]] party and the [[Socialist Party of Ukraine]] (SPU) to prevent the [[Party of Regions]] from gaining power.&lt;ref name=pm2006/&gt; [[Yulia Tymoshenko]] solicited to become Prime Minister.&lt;ref name=pm2006&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4848958.stm Ukraine leaders jostle for power], [[BBC News]] (27 March 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; However, negotiations with Our Ukraine and SPU faced many difficulties as the various blocs scrapped over posts and engaged in counter-negotiations with other groupings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/country_profiles/1107869.stm Timeline: Ukraine], [[BBC News]] (Page last updated at 26 October 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; Apparently [[President of Ukraine|President]] [[Viktor Yushchenko]] did not want Tymoshenko to become [[Prime Minister of Ukraine|Prime Minister]].&lt;ref name=NoTymo&amp;Moroz!!!&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=C8C3xuqd6aMC&amp;pg=PA214&amp;lpg=PA214&amp;dq=How+Ukraine+became+a+market+economy+and+democracy+%22Yushchenko+did+not+want+Tymoshenko+as+prime+minister+again%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ui4As88O33&amp;sig=403m68VYBSON1LFEid_-_vEAwn4&amp;hl=nl&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=v1IGT7OiKIPtOdeDpPwC&amp;ved=0CB4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false How Ukraine Became a Market Economy and Democracy] by [[Anders Åslund]], [[Peterson Institute for International Economics]], 2009, {{ISBN|0-88132-427-2}} (page 214)&lt;/ref&gt; Initially SPU's [[Oleksandr Moroz]] wanted the post of [[Chairman of the Verkhovna Rada]].&lt;ref name=NoTymo&amp;Moroz!!!/&gt;

On Wednesday 21 June 2006, the Ukrainian media reported that the three parties had finally reached a coalition agreement, which appeared to have ended nearly three months of political uncertainty.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/5101380.stm Ukraine allies 'agree coalition'], [[BBC News]] (21 June 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/5105192.stm Ukraine coalition deal confirmed], [[BBC News]] (22 June 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

Tymoshenko's nomination and confirmation as new Prime Minister was expected to be straightforward. However, the nomination was preconditioned on an election of her long-term rival [[Petro Poroshenko]] from Our Ukraine as the speaker of the parliament. Tymoshenko stated that she would vote for any speaker from the coalition.&lt;ref name=Poro/&gt; Within a few days after the coalition agreement had been signed, it became clear that the coalition members mistrusted each other,&lt;ref name=Poro&gt;{{uk icon}} [http://www.day.kiev.ua/164705/ Парламент почав працювати, але коаліції в ньому більше немає], День (7 July 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; since they considered it to be a deviation from parliamentary procedures in order to hold a simultaneous vote on Poroshenko as the speaker and Tymoshenko as Prime Minister.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.europeanforum.net/news/166/oleksandr_moroz_announced_a_new_coalition_for_ukraine Oleksandr Moroz announced a new coalition for Ukraine] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725235037/http://www.europeanforum.net/news/166/oleksandr_moroz_announced_a_new_coalition_for_ukraine |date=25 July 2011 }}, [[European Forum for Democracy and Solidarity]] (11 July 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jamestown.org/single/?no_cache=1&amp;tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D%3D31839 {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101226121532/http://www.jamestown.org/single/?no_cache=1&amp;tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=31839 |date=26 December 2010 }}, [[Jamestown Foundation]] (4 July 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Party of Regions announced an ultimatum to the coalition, demanding that the parliamentary procedures be observed, asking membership in parliamentary committees to be allocated in proportion to seats held by each fraction, chairmanship in certain Parliamentary committees as well as Governorships in the [[Subdivisions of Ukraine|administrative subdivisions]] won by the Party of Regions.&lt;ref name=PORL/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kyivpost.com/news/business/bus_general/detail/24728/ Ukrainian coalition, opposition to hold round table aimed to solve political crisis], [[Kyiv Post]] (3 July 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; The Party of Regions complained the coalition agreement deprived the Party of Regions and the communists of any representation in the executive and leadership in parliamentary committees while in the local regional councils won by the Party of Regions, the coalition parties were locked out of all committees as well.&lt;ref name=PORL&gt;[http://www.rferl.org/content/article/1069496.html Opposition Blocks Ukrainian Parliament Session], [[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]] (27 June 2006 )&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, a [[solar energy]] company, Team Solar, in [[Kerala]], India, used two women to create political contacts with links even to the [[Chief Minister (India)|Chief Minister's]] office, duped several influential people to the tune of 70 lakhs &amp;nbsp;, by offering to make them business partners, or by offering to install solar power units for them, and receiving advance payments for the same. Team Solar was unsuccessful in lobbying Kerala Govt to get include in [[Agency for Non-conventional Energy and Rural Technology|ANERT]] programmes.

==Incident==
The Team Solar Energy Company (Team Solar),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.outlookindia.com/website/story/one-woman-many-powerful-men/296798|title=One Woman &amp; Many Powerful Men|publisher=[[Outlook Magazine]]|accessdate=2016-08-31|date=Apr 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; floated by the main accused [[Biju Radhakrishnan]] and [[Saritha. S. Nair]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Saritha Nair's 10 tips to people who are in love|url=http://www.cochintalkies.com/celebrity/saritha-s-nair.html|accessdate=19 June 2015|newspaper=Cochin Talkies|date=19 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; directors of the company, allegedly collected advance amounts from large number of people and investors by offering to make them business partners, or in the guise of installing alternate sources of energy and failed to deliver the goods. The company awarded a "Virgin Earth Golden Feather Environment Award" to several prominent people of Kerala to gain media coverage and credibility.&lt;ref name=award&gt;{{cite news|title=Solar panel scam: Saritha makes statement in court|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/solar-panel-scam-saritha-makes-statement-in-court/article4935243.ece|accessdate=25 July 2013|newspaper=The Hindu|date=20 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scam came to light when one of the customers who had paid for the installation filed a case against the company. The arrangement has defrauded several agencies and people to the tune of crores of rupees and at least one lady actor was used as "brand ambassador" to lure gullible people.&lt;ref name=today1&gt;{{cite news|last=PTI|title=Name of another starlet crops up in solar panel scam   |url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/name-of-another-starlet-crops-up-in-solar-panel-scam/1/290943.html|accessdate=25 July 2013|newspaper=India Today|date=12 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were widespread protests across the state, mainly by Leftist youth groups, after an interview with an industrialist was aired on television, which alleged fraud by the company.&lt;ref name=boil&gt;{{cite news|title=Kerala boils over solar panel scam|url=http://www.deccanherald.com/content/343860/kerala-boils-over-solar-panel.html|accessdate=25 July 2013|newspaper=Deccan Herald|date=9 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The incident drew much attention because most of those who lost big money were all influential people, the women allegedly involved fueled the imagination/ jealousy of the depraved Malayalam Media{{citation needed|reason= Insulting towards M→→←→alayali media, without reason|date=December 2015}} and the alleged involvement of three officials from the office of the Chief Minister of [[Kerala]], [[Oommen Chandy]], who made several phone calls to Saritha. It caused great embarrassment to Chandy, who faced demands for his resignation; two of the officials involved in phone conversation, lost their positions.&lt;ref name=gather&gt;{{cite news|title=Solar panel scam: Demand for Kerala CM's resignation gathers momentum|url=http://www.business-standard.com/article/news-ani/solar-panel-scam-demand-for-kerala-cm-s-resignation-gathers-momentum-113071300109_1.html|accessdate=25 July 2013|newspaper=Business Standard|date=13 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The total amount involved in the scam, calculated on the basis of complaints, is less than {{INRConvert|100|m}} but the aggressive protests by Leftist political parties and the ''modus operandi'' used by the company has made the scam notorious.&lt;ref name=total1&gt;{{cite news|title=Solar scam eclipses a sunshine industry|url=http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/news/states/solar-scam-eclipses-a-sunshine-industry/article4898713.ece|accessdate=25 July 2013|newspaper=Business LIne|date=10 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The chief accused, Saritha Nair&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Solar panel cheating: Sarita S Nair under judicial custody|url=http://www.mathrubhumi.com/english/story.php?id=136988|publisher=Mathrubhumi|accessdate=15 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and one of the Chief Minister’s personal aides Tenny Joppan&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Solar panel scam: Tenny Joppen remanded to judicial custody|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/solar-panel-scam-tenny-joppan-remanded-to-judicial-custody/article4863120.ece|work=The Hindu|accessdate=15 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; has been fired and arrested.

===Biju Radhakrishnan===
Biju Radhakrishnan was already caught in a case pertaining to the murder of his wife Rashmi. However, despite having evidence of his involvement in the murder, he was not arrested&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Biju Radhakrishnan walked free despite evidence|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2013-06-22/thiruvananthapuram/40133428_1_reshmi-crime-branch-forensic-report|work=Times of India|accessdate=15 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
After his arrest, at Coimbatore, by the Kollam Crime Branch CID, he admitted to Rashmi's murder by giving her poisoned liquor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Biju admits to killing his wife Reshmi|url=http://www.mathrubhumi.com/english/story.php?id=137137|accessdate=15 July 2013|newspaper=Mathrubhumi|date=19 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Saritha S Nair===
Saritha Nair was a director of the Team Solar Renewable Energy Co. and an accomplice of the Biju Radhakrishnan in the Solar Scam.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.manoramaonline.com/news/kerala/2017/11/08/solar-commission-report-public-pinarayi-chandy.html Saritha Nair Letter]&lt;/ref&gt; She was arrested on the complaint of one of the persons who she had defrauded, in Ambalapuzha&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Saritha Nair in police custody|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/saritha-nair-in-police-custody/article4826121.ece|accessdate=15 July 2013|newspaper=The Hindu|date=18 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
She later requested the Economic Offences court where her case is being heard, that she wanted to give a secret statement,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Saritha makes secret statement|url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/130721/news-current-affairs/article/saritha-makes-secret-statement|work=Deccan Chronicle|accessdate=21 July 2013|date=21 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; which would help to broaden the scope of the investigation. Her attorney, Fenny Balakrishnan termed the revelations as very crucial and capable of changing the direction of the investigation. She was released on bail in February 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Kerala: Solar panel scam accused Saritha Nair released on jail|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/india/crime/kerala-solar-panel-scam-accused-saritha-nair-released-on-bail/|accessdate=24 February 2014|newspaper=The Indian Express|date=21 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her name reappeared in the news after her scandal video was released and went viral on social media including [[WhatsApp]] on 12 October 2014. On 2015 June 2 her short film [[Anthyakoodasha]] was released on YouTube, which has crossed 500k views as on 18 May 2016
===Premchand===
Television and film actress [[Shalu Menon]], a close associate of Biju Radhakrishnan, initially denied any knowledge or relationship with Biju Radhakrishnan. Photographs showing the two of them posing together or Biju handing over keys to a new vehicle she had purchased recently were explained away, on TV, as pictures taken at his request.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Shalu Menon denies involvement in solar scam|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/shalu-menon-denies-involvement-in-solar-scam/article4823751.ece|work=The Hindu|accessdate=15 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, she came under the scanner of the Police and was arrested upon concluding that she was also an accomplice to the scam and had used her popularity to entice customers into parting with their money. She was released on bail in August 2013.&lt;ref name="thehindu.com"&gt;{{cite news|title=Solar scam case: Joppan, Shalu walk out of jail|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/solar-scam-case-joppan-shalu-walk-out-of-jail/article5056778.ece|accessdate=24 February 2014|newspaper=The Hindu|date=25 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was released on bail in August 2013.&lt;ref name="thehindu.com"/&gt;

===A Firoze===
A Firoz, a government servant, surrendered himself on 18 July, after the court rejected his plea for anticipatory bail. He was accused of helping to dupe a builder of 4&amp;nbsp;million Rupees along with Biju and Saritha, by claiming one of them was an ADB official and they could arrange a contract with the ADB.

At least four Kerala Cabinet ministers, three MLAs and hordes of government officials besides a junior Central Minister had been roped in by the women and their phone calls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Solar Scam: ADGP seeks explanation on leakage of phone calls details|url=http://www.keralanext.com/news/2013/07/06/article130.asp|publisher=Kerala Next|accessdate=15 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Action against IG T J Jose for leaking phone details|url=http://kaumudiglobal.com/innerpage1.php?newsid=38465|publisher=Kerala Kaumudi|accessdate=15 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Allegations against the Chief Minister==
Allegations against the Chief Minister [[Oommen Chandy]] have been raised, due to phone calls made by his personal staff and forged letters&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Scam-accused had forged Kerala CM's letterhead: Aide|url=http://newindianexpress.com/states/kerala/Scam-accused-had-forged-Kerala-CMs-letterhead-Aide/2013/06/27/article1654794.ece|publisher=The New Indian Express|accessdate=15 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; which were used by the fraudsters to defraud customers.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4957">On 1 December 2018, a [[motion of no confidence]] in the government of [[Nicola Zingaretti]] tabled by [[Centre-right coalition]] was defeated 22 to 26, with one no-vote of Forza Italia and a few absent.

==History==
After the [[Lazio regional election, 2018]] it came to a [[hung parliament]]. The [[Centre-left coalition]] only won 25 of the 51 seats, but won the presidential election, just ahead of the [[Centre-right coalition|center-right]] candidate [[Stefano Parisi]] with 32.9% to 31.2%. The Zingaretti's government is supported by two splits from [[Forza Italia (2013)|Forza Italia]] ([[Pino Cangemi]]) and the [[Lega Nord|League]] ([[Enrico Cavallari]]).&lt;ref name="Pirozzi"&gt;[https://www.latinaquotidiano.it/sfiducia-a-zingaretti-pirozzi-propone-il-notaio-e-il-centrodestra-litiga/ Sfiducia a Zingaretti, Pirozzi propone il notaio e il centrodestra litiga], LatinaQuotidiano.it from 23 November 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

In the other [[Italian regional elections, 2018|regional elections in 2018]] in the [[Lombard regional election, 2018|Lombardy]], in [[Molise regional election, 2018|Molise]], the in [[Friuli-Venezia Giulia regional election, 2018|Friuli-Venezia Giulia]] and in [[Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol provincial elections, 2018|Trentino]] won the [[Centre-right coalition]].

On November 22, the Centre-right parties announced the motion of no confidence.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.alessioporcu.it/articoli/mozione-sfiducia-zingaretti-trappola-per-cangemi/ La mossa perfetta per incastrare Cangemi], Alessioporcu.it from 22 November 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 23, [[Sergio Pirozzi]] declared his support for the Motion of no confidence.&lt;ref name="Pirozzi"/&gt;

On November 29, [[Enrico Cavallari]] declared that he didn't support the Motion of no confidence, [[Claudio Fazzone]] the regional coordinator of Forza Italia sayed, that the motion can not be reached by Cavallari anymore&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.affaritaliani.it/roma/regione-cavallari-salva-zingaretti-no-alla-sfiducia-forza-italia-si-sfila-574855.html  Regione, Cavallari salva Zingaretti: “No alla sfiducia”. Forza Italia si sfila], {{ill|Affaritaliani.it|it|Affaritaliani.it}} from 29 November 2018&lt;/ref&gt; and Pino Cangemi declared his support.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.askanews.it/cronaca/2018/11/29/consiglio-lazio-cangemi-seguirò-fi-su-sfiducia-a-zingaretti-pn_20181129_00173/ Consiglio Lazio, Cangemi: seguirò FI su sfiducia a Zingaretti], {{ill|askanews|it|askanews}} from 29 November 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 1, the opposition failed with the vote of no confidence against Zingaretti, by the absence of Sergio Pirozzi, [[Pasquale Ciacciarelli]] (FI) and Enrico Cavallari and the no-vote of [[Laura Cartaginese]] (FI).

'''The Banking Lobby''' refers to the representatives from various firms and organizations seeking favorable terms from governments for big [[bank]]s and other [[financial service]] companies through [[lobbying]] and [[advocacy group]]s.

The banking lobby generally opposes stricter [[government regulation]] of [[financial markets]] while tending to stress the importance of banks in the economy. Some are concerned, however, that they may seek terms that do not necessarily increase performance of the economy as a whole, but only benefit the large banks.

In the US the [[finance industry|finance]], [[real estate]], and [[insurance industry|insurance industries]] reportedly spent a collective [[Orders_of_magnitude_(currency)#1_billion_to_100_billion|$6.8 Billion]] from 1998 through 2011, far more than any other lobbying sector.&lt;ref name=Huff&gt;{{cite web

The Commission is independent of Government and the Civil Service.

The Civil Service Commission was established by Gladstone through an order in council on 21 May 1855 following publication of the [[Northcote–Trevelyan Report]] by [[Sir Charles Trevelyan, 1st Baronet|Charles Trevelyan]] and [[Stafford Northcote]] that advocated the decoupling of appointments of senior civil servants from ministers to insure the impartiality of the [[Her Majesty's Civil Service|Civil Service]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =Walker | first =David | title = Fair game| pages = | work=The Guardian | date = 2003-07-09| url =https://www.theguardian.com/society/2003/jul/09/publicsector.guardiansocietysupplement | accessdate =2003-07-09 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following a report of the [[Committee on Standards in Public Life]], ''"Defining the Boundaries within the Executive: Ministers, special advisers and the permanent Civil Service"'' in 2003, the appointment of the First Civil Service Commissioner is made by Government after consultation with the leaders of the main opposition parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Government publishes response to the ninth report of the committee on standards in public life |publisher=10 Downing Street |date=2003-09-11 |url=http://www.number-10.gov.uk/output/Page4447.asp |accessdate=2008-02-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070611003421/http://www.number-10.gov.uk/output/Page4447.asp |archivedate=2007-06-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; They are then appointed by the [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen]] under Royal Prerogative.&lt;ref name=Janet /&gt; The First Civil Service Commissioner is appointed for a fixed term of five years, although another Commissioner may act as an interim First Commissioner when necessary.

{{Marxism|History}}

In [[marxism|Marxist]] thought, '''communist society''' or the '''communist system''' is the type of [[society]] and [[economic system]] postulated to emerge from technological advances in the [[productive forces]], representing the ultimate goal of the political ideology of [[Communism]]. A communist society is characterized by [[common ownership]] of the [[means of production]] with free access&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Steele|first= David Ramsay |title= From Marx to Mises: Post Capitalist Society and the Challenge of Economic Calculation |publisher= Open Court|date=September 1999|isbn= 978-0875484495|page = 66|quote= Marx distinguishes between two phases of marketless communism: an initial phase, with labor vouchers, and a higher phase, with free access.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Busky|first= Donald F.|title= Democratic Socialism: A Global Survey|publisher= Praeger|date=July 20, 2000|isbn= 978-0275968861|page = 4|quote=Communism would mean free distribution of goods and services.

Communism is a specific stage of [[socioeconomic development]] predicated upon a superabundance of material wealth, which is postulated to arise from advances in production technology and corresponding changes in the social [[relations of production]]. This would allow for [[From each according to his ability, to each according to his need|distribution based on need]] and social relations based on [[Free association (communism and anarchism)|freely-associated individuals]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''Critique of the Gotcha Programme'', Karl Marx.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090605001014/http://www.economictheories.org/2009/05/full-communism-ultimate-goal.html ''Full Communism: The Ultimate Goal'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "communist society" should be distinguished from the Western concept of the "[[communist state]]", the latter referring to a state ruled by a party which professes a variation of [[Marxism–Leninism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Busky|first= Donald F.|title= Democratic Socialism: A Global Survey|publisher= Praeger|date=July 20, 2000|isbn= 978-0275968861|page = 9|quote=In a modern sense of the word, communism refers to the ideology of Marxism-Leninism.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Economics of Socialism after World War Two: 1945-1990"&gt;{{cite book |last= Wilczynski|first= J. |title= The Economics of Socialism after World War Two: 1945-1990 |publisher= Aldine Transaction|date= 2008|isbn= 978-0202362281|pages = 21|quote=Contrary to Western usage, these countries describe themselves as ‘Socialist’ (not ‘Communist’). The second stage (Marx’s ‘higher phase’), or ‘Communism’ is to be marked by an age of plenty, distribution according to needs (not work), the absence of money and the market mechanism, the disappearance of the last vestiges of capitalism and the ultimate ‘whithering away of the state.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economic aspects==
{{Economic systems sidebar}}
A communist economic system would be characterized by advanced productive technology that enables material abundance, which in turn would enable the free distribution of most or all economic output and the holding of the means of producing this output in common. In this respect communism is differentiated from [[socialism]], which, out of economic necessity, restricts access to articles of consumption and services based on [[To each according to his contribution|one's contribution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Gregory and Stuart |first= Paul and Robert |title= Comparing Economic Systems in the Twenty-First |publisher= South-Western College Pub |year= 2003|isbn= 0-618-26181-8|page = 118|quote=Communism, the highest stage of social and economic development, would be characterized by the absence of markets and money and by abundance, distribution according to need, and the withering away of the state…Under socialism, each individual would be expected to contribute according to capability, and rewards would be distributed in proportion to that contribution. Subsequently, under communism, the basis of reward would be need.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In further contrast to previous economic systems, communism would be characterized by the holding of natural resources and the means of production in common as opposed to them being privately owned (as in the case of [[capitalism]]) or owned by public or cooperative organizations that similarly restricts their access (as in the case of socialism). In this sense, communism involves the "negation of property" insofar as there would be little economic rationale for exclusive control over production assets in an environment of material abundance.&lt;ref name="Clark1998"/&gt;

The fully developed communist economic system is postulated to develop from a preceding socialist system. Marx held the view that socialism—a system based on [[social ownership]] of the means of production—would enable progress toward the development of fully developed communism by further advancing productive technology. Under socialism, with its increasing levels of automation, an increasing proportion of goods would be distributed freely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Wood|first= John Cunningham |title= Karl Marx’s Economics: Critical Assessments I |publisher= Routledge|date=1996|isbn=978-0415087148|page = 248|quote=In particular, this economy would possess (1) social ownership and control of industry by the ‘associated producers’ and (2) a sufficiently high level of economic development to enable substantial progress toward ‘full communism’ and thereby some combination of the following: super affluence; distribution of an increasing proportion of commodities as if they were free goods; an increase in the proportion of collective goods...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A communist society would free individuals from long working hours by first automating production to an extent that the average length of the working day is reduced&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Peffer|first= Rodney G. |title= Marxism, Morality, and Social Justice |publisher= Princeton University Press|date=2014|isbn= 9780691608884|page = 73|quote= Marx believed the reduction of necessary labor time to be, evaluatively speaking, an absolute necessity. He claims that real wealth is the developed productive force of all individuals. It is no longer the labor time but the disposable time that is the measure of wealth.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and second by eliminating the exploitation inherent in the division between workers and owners. A communist system would thus free individuals from alienation in the sense of having one's life structured around survival (making a wage or salary in a capitalist system), which Marx referred to as a transition from the "realm of necessity" to the "realm of freedom." As a result, a communist society is envisioned as being composed of an intellectually-inclined population with both the time and resources to pursue its [[creativity|creative]] hobbies and genuine interests, and to contribute to creative social wealth in this manner. Karl Marx considered "true richness" to be the amount of time one has at his disposal to pursue one's creative passions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Jessop and Wheatley|first= Bob and Russell|title= Karl Marx's Social and Political Thought, Volume 6|publisher= Routledge|date=1999|isbn= 9780415193283|page = 9|quote=Marx in the Grundrisse speaks of a time when systematic automation will be developed to the point where direct human labor power will be a source of wealth.

K. Kautsky (Stuttgart, 1910), pp. 303-4.&lt;/ref&gt; Marx's notion of communism is in this way radically individualistic.&lt;ref name="Karl Marx on Equality"&gt;{{cite web|title='Karl Marx on Equality|last=Woods|first=Allen.

It would instead be a society in which individuals freely act as the truly human individuals they are. Marx’s radical communism was, in this way, also radically individualistic.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marx's concept of the "realm of freedom" goes hand-in-hand with his idea of the ending of the [[division of labor]], which would not be required in a society with highly automated production and limited work roles.

In a communist society, economic necessity and relations would cease to determine cultural and social relations. As [[scarcity]] is eliminated,&lt;ref name="Clark1998"/&gt; [[alienated labor]] would cease and people would be free to pursue their individual goals.&lt;ref name="Calhoun2002-20-23"&gt;{{cite book|author=Craig J. Calhoun|title=Classical sociological theory|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6mq-H3EcUx8C=PA20|accessdate=5 March 2011|year=2002|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|isbn=978-0-631-21348-2|pages=23-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Politics, law, and governance===
Marx and Engels maintained that a communist society would have no need for the state as it exists in contemporary capitalist society. The capitalist state mainly exists to enforce hierarchical economic relations, to enforce the exclusive control of property, and to regulate capitalistic economic activities—all of which would be non-applicable to a communist system.&lt;ref name="Clark1998"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Calhoun2002-20-23"/&gt;

Engels noted that in a socialist system the primary function of public institutions will shift from being about the creation of laws and the control of people into a technical role as an administrator of technical production processes, with a decrease in the scope of traditional politics as scientific administration overtakes the role of political decision-making.&lt;ref&gt;''Socialism: Utopian and Scientific'', on Marxists.org: http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1880/soc-utop/ch01.htm: "In 1816, he declares that politics is the science of production, and foretells the complete absorption of politics by economics. The knowledge that economic conditions are the basis of political institutions appears here only in embryo. Yet what is here already very plainly expressed is the idea of the future conversion of political rule over men into an administration of things and a direction of processes of production."&lt;/ref&gt; Communist society is characterized by democratic processes, not merely in the sense of electoral democracy, but in the broader sense of open and collaborative social and workplace environments.&lt;ref name="Clark1998"/&gt;

Marx never clearly specified whether or not he thought a communist society would be [[justice|just]]; other thinkers have speculated that he thought communism would transcend justice and create society without conflicts, thus, without the needs for rules of justice.&lt;ref name=sep&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/marx/|title=Karl Marx – Stanford Encyclopaedia of Philosophy}}. First published Tue Aug 26, 2003; substantive revision Mon Jun 14, 2010. Accessed March 4, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transitional stages===
Marx also wrote that between [[capitalist]] and communist society, there would be a transitory period known as the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]].&lt;ref name="Clark1998"&gt;{{cite book|author=Barry Stewart Clark|title=Political economy: a comparative approach|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3bJHvA1H-2kC&amp;pg=PA57|accessdate=7 March 2011|year=1998|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-0-275-96370-5|pages=57–59}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this preceding phase of societal development, capitalist economic relationships would gradually be abolished and replaced with socialism. Natural resources would become [[public property]], while all manufacturing centers and workplaces would become socially owned and [[Workplace democracy|democratically]] [[Workers' self-management|managed]]. Production would be organized by scientific [[Program evaluation|assessment]] and [[Planned economy|planning]], thus eliminating what Marx called the "anarchy in production". The development of the productive forces would lead to the marginalization of human labor to the highest possible extent, to be gradually replaced by [[Automation|automated]] labor.

==Open-source and peer production==

Many aspects of a communist economy have emerged in recent decades in the form of [[open-source software]] and [[Open source hardware|hardware]], where source code and thus the means of producing software is held in common and freely accessible to everyone; and to the processes of [[peer production]] where collaborative work processes produce freely available software that does not rely on monetary valuation. [[Michel Bauwens]] juxtaposes open source and peer production with "market production".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.p2pfoundation.net/from-the-communism-of-capital-to-a-capital-for-the-commons/2014/03/22 |title=From the Communism of Capital to a Capital for the Commons |author=Michel Bauwens |date=22 March 2014 |publisher=P2P Foundation |accessdate=26 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ray Kurzweil]] posits that the goals of communism will be realized by advanced technological developments in the 21st century, where the intersection of low manufacturing costs, material abundance and open-source design philosophies will enable the realization of the maxim "from each according to his ability, to each according to his needs".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |people= Ray Kurzweil |date= February 1, 2012 |title=  Kurzweil: Technology Will Achieve the Goals of Communism  |url= http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xm7xnn_kurzweil-technology-will-achieve-the-goals-of-communism_news|format= |medium= |language= English |publisher= FORA TV |location= |accessdate= |time= |id= |isbn= |oclc= |quote= |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Soviet ideology==
{{Communism sidebar|Theory}}
{{Overquotation|section|date=September 2017}}
The communist economic system was officially enumerated as the ultimate goal of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] in its party platform. According to the 1986 Programme of the CPSU:
{{quote|Communism is a classless social system with one form of public ownership of the means of production and with full social equality of all members of society. Under communism, the all-round development of people will be accompanied by the growth of the productive forces on the basis of continuous progress in science and technology, all the springs of social wealth will flow abundantly, and the great principle "From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs" will be implemented. Communism is a highly organised society of free, socially conscious working people a society in which public self-government will be established, a society in which labour for the good of society will become the prime vital requirement of everyone, a clearly recognised necessity, and the ability of each person will be employed to the greatest benefit of the people.

The material and technical foundation of communism presupposes the creation of those productive forces that open up opportunities for the full satisfaction of the reasonable requirements of society and the individual. All productive activities under communism will be based on the use of highly efficient technical facilities and technologies, and the harmonious interaction of man and nature will be ensured.

In the highest phase of communism the directly social character of labor and production will become firmly established. Through the complete elimination of the remnants of the old division of labor and the essential social differences associated with it, the process of forming a socially homogeneous society will be completed.

Communism signifies the transformation of the system of socialist self-government by the people, of socialist democracy into the highest form of organization of society: communist public self-government. With the maturation of the necessary socioeconomic and ideological preconditions and the involvement of all citizens in administration, the socialist state—given appropriate international conditions—will, as Lenin noted, increasingly become a transitional form "from a state to a non-state." The activities of state bodies will become non-political in nature, and the need for the state as a special political institution will gradually disappear.

The inalienable feature of the communist mode of life is a high level of consciousness, social activity, discipline, and self-discipline of members of society, in which observance of the uniform, generally accepted rules of communist conduct will become an inner need and habit of every person.

Communism is a social system under which the free development of each is a condition for the free development of all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eurodos.home.xs4all.nl/docu/cpsu-texts/cpsu86-21.htm#CPSUTasks |title=The CPSU's Tasks In Perfecting Socialism And Making A Gradual Transition To Communism |work=Program of the CPSU, 27th Congress, 1986 – Part Two|author= |date=1998 |publisher=Eurodos |accessdate=26 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In [[Vladimir Lenin]]'s political theory, a classless society would be a society controlled by the direct producers, organized to produce according to socially managed goals. Such a society, Lenin suggested, would develop habits that would gradually make political representation unnecessary, as the radically democratic nature of the Soviets would lead citizens to come to agree with the representatives' style of management. Only in this environment, Lenin suggested, could [[Withering away of the state|the state wither away]], ushering in a period of stateless communism. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The State and Revolution|last=Lenin|first=Vladimir|publisher=|year=1917|isbn=|location=|pages=106}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In [[Ideology of the Soviet Union|Soviet ideology]], Marx's concepts of the "lower and higher phases of communism" articulated in the ''[[Critique of the Gotha Program]]'' were reformulated as the stages of "socialism" and "communism".&lt;ref&gt;Lenin, V.I.

Marxists.org. https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1917/staterev/ch05.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviet state claimed to have begun the phase of "socialist construction" during the implementation of the first [[Five-year plans for the national economy of the Soviet Union|Five-Year Plans]] during the 1930s, which introduced a centrally planned, nationalized/collectivized economy. The 1962 Program of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, published under the leadership of [[Nikita Khrushchev]], claimed that socialism had been firmly established in the USSR, and that the state would now progress to the "full-scale construction of communism",&lt;ref&gt;Program of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. With a special pref. to the American ed. by N. S. Khrushchev. New York: International Publishers, 1963. https://archive.org/details/ProgramOfTheCommunistPartyOfTheSovietUnion_150&lt;/ref&gt; although this may be understood to refer to the "technical foundations" of communism more so than the withering away of the state and the division of labor per se. However, even in the final edition of its program before the party's dissolution, the CPSU did not claim to have fully established communism,&lt;ref&gt;Program of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. A New Edition. 1986. https://archive.org/details/ProgramOfTheCommunistPartyOfTheSovietUnion&lt;/ref&gt; instead claiming that the society was undergoing a very slow and gradual process of transition.

"Condominium" is a legal term used  in most provinces of Canada.  in  British Columbia, it is referred to as "strata title" and  in Quebec, the term "divided co-property" (French: copropriété divisée) is used, although the colloquial name remains "condominium".

With regular condominiums, the unit owner usually owns the internal unit space and a share of the corporation; the corporation owns the exterior of the building land and common area; in the case of a ''freehold condominium'' the owner owns the land and building and the corporation owns common shared roadways and amenities.&lt;ref name=cmhc&gt;{{cite web

== History ==
Before 1981 condominiums made up less than ten percent of homes built in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macleans.ca/society/life/condo-hell/|title=Condo hell|date=22 April 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==British Columbia Strata Housing==

Over a million people live in strata housing in British Columbia. Strata properties are a popular housing choice in B.C. because it is  convenient, provides security and added amenities and is  usually less costly than buying a [[single-family home]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/housing-tenancy/strata-housing|title=Strata Housing - Province of British Columbia|first=Office of Housing and Construction|last=Standards|date=|work=gov.bc.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the price of single-family housing has soared to unprecedented levels in [[Vancouver]], the number of new condominium sales has increased, along with prices. According to the [[Real Estate Board of Greater Vancouver]], the benchmark price for a condo in July, 2016 was $510,600 in the region, up 27.4 per cent from the same month in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/real-estate/vancouver/financial-fault-lines-the-earthquake-risk-of-vancouvers-condo-boom/article31354381/|title=Financial fault lines: The earthquake risk of Vancouver's condo boom|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Insurance under the Strata Property Act===
The Strata Property Act requires all stratas to maintain an insurance policy for a minimum of $2 million (property and liability) that covers the common elements and the units as originally buïlt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/housing-tenancy/strata-housing/operating-a-strata/finances-and-insurance/insurance#for|title=Insurance  - Province of British Columbia|first=Office of Housing and Construction|last=Standards|date=|work=gov.bc.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ontario ==

There are over 1.3 million condo owners and/or residents living in more than 587,000 condominium units in Ontario. One-half of new construction in 2013 was condominium-related.&lt;ref&gt;In, ''Condo Owners Association'', [http://www.COAtoronto.com.html COA Toronto], March 10, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, the condominium industry has been booming in Canada, with dozens of new towers being erected each year. Toronto is the centre of this boom, with 17,000 new units being sold in 2005, more than double second place Miami's 7,500 units.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070929100019/http://www.thestar.com/NASApp/cs/ContentServer? pagename=thestar%2FLayout%2FArticle_Type1&amp;c=Article&amp;cid=1148507412275&amp;call_pageid=968332188492&amp;col=968793972154&amp;t=TS_Home ]&lt;/ref&gt; Toronto's condo population has grown from 978,125 in 2011 to 1.478 million people in 2016 representing 54.7% of the city population according to [http://www.TOcondonews.com Toronto Condo News].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tocondonews.com/archives/torontos-condo-population/|title=Toronto's Condo Population - Toronto Condo News|author=|date=March 2017|work=TOcondonews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Outside of Toronto, the most common forms of condominium have been townhomes rather than highrises, although that trend may be altered as limitations are placed on "Greenfields" (see [[Greenfield land]]) developments in those areas (in turn, forcing developers to expand upward rather than outward and to consider more condominium conversions instead of new housing). Particular growth areas are in Kitchener/Waterloo, Barrie, and London. In fact, after Toronto, the Golden Horseshoe Chapter of the Canadian Condominium Institute is one of that organization's most thriving chapters.[http://www.ghccci.org/]

===Ontario Condominium Act===

====Condominium Authority of Ontario====
Condominium Authority of Ontario (CAO) was established, in 2017, by the Province of Ontario to address concerns about condo living and management in the province.  Its goal is to minimize issues before they become disputes to help with community building.  To do this they have implemented three pillars; education, mandated reporting and disclosure of information, and a tribunal for handling disputes that arise&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why the Condominium Authority of Ontario Exists|url=http://tocondonews.com/archives/why-the-condominium-authority-of-ontario-exists/|website=Toronto Condo News|publisher=Toronto Condo News}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In a March 2018 [http://www.TOcondonews.com Toronto Condo News] article, the Executive Director of the Condominium Authority of Ontario explains it has an "overarching goal to enhance consumer protection for condominium owners, directors and residents. This is made possible through a comprehensive offering of information about condominium ownership including self-help tools, mandatory director training, and a new online dispute resolution service, the Condominium Authority Tribunal (CAT)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Condominium Authority of Ontario – Supporting Condominium Communities|url=http://tocondonews.com/archives/condominium-authority-ontario-supporting-condominium-communities/|accessdate=16 May 2018|issue=March 2018|publisher=Toronto Condo News|date=March 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ontario Condominium Act, 1998====
Until December 2015,  condominiums  in Ontario were governed by the Ontario Condominium Act, 1998&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canlii.org/en/on/laws/stat/so-1998-c-19/latest/so-1998-c-19.html|title=Condominium Act, 1998, S.O. 1998, c. 19|accessdate=2009-10-06|last=|first=|date=Version in force as of access date|work=|publisher=Queen's Printer for Ontario|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091020020012/http://www.canlii.org/en/on/laws/stat/so-1998-c-19/latest/so-1998-c-19.html|archivedate=2009-10-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; with each development establishing a corporation to deal with day-to-day functions (maintenance, repairs, etc.). A board of directors is elected by the owners of units (or, in the case of a common elements condominium corporation, the owners of the common interest in the common elements) in the development on at least a yearly basis. A general meeting is held annually to deal with board elections and the appointment of an auditor (or waiving of audit). Other matters can also be dealt with at the Annual General Meeting, but special meetings of the owners can be called by the board and, in some cases, by the owners themselves, at any time.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|LeW2HJs7JRw|Linda Pinizzotto, Founder, President and CEO of the Ontario Condo Owner's Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ontario Condominium Act, 1998 provided an effectively wide range of development options, including Standard, Phased, Vacant Land, Common Element and Leasehold condominiums. Certain existing condominiums can amalgamate, and existing properties can be converted to condominium (provided municipal requirements for the same are met). Accordingly, the expanded and expanding use of the condominium concept is permitting developers and municipalities to consider newer and more interesting forms of development to meet social needs.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

On this issue, Ontario condominium lawyer Michael Clifton writes, "Condominium development has steadily increased in Ontario for several years. While condominiums typically represent attractive lifestyle and home-ownership alternatives for buyers, they also, importantly, introduce a new approach to community planning for home builders and municipal approval authorities in Ontario. ...[There are] opportunities for developers to be both creative and profitable in building, and municipalities more flexible and imaginative in planning and approving, developments that will become sustainable communities."&lt;ref&gt;In, ''A Comment about Condominiums, Community Planning and Sustainability'', [http://www.forummagazine.ca/magazine/index.htm Forum Magazine], Dec 06/Jan 07, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

Reserve fund contributions are ten percent of the condominium fees collected or higher. {{citation needed|date=January 2017}} Contrary to other jurisdictions such as Alberta, Ontario does not provide flexibility for small condo corporations to conduct their own [[reserve fund study]], or to update it less frequently than required for large corporations.  Managers of small condominium corporations have asked the Ontario Ministry of Consumer Services to review this requirement as it becomes burdensome for the management of smaller buildings.

====Ontario - Condo Owners Association &amp; Condo Act Review====
To assist the public to know more about condominiums and condominium operations, the Condo Owners Association provides information for condo owners, buyers and the general public.&lt;ref&gt;In ''Condominium Information'', [http://coaontario.com], December 15, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Ontario]], the provincial Condominium Act 1998 was under review, as of August, 2015, and the Condo Owners Association (COA Ontario) was a stakeholder in the process. COA Ontario&lt;ref&gt;In, ''Condo Owners Association'', [http://www.COAontario.com.html [COA Ontario], March 10, 2010/.March 10, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; had been working with the [[Ministry of Consumer Services]] of the [[provincial government]] to help build a better Condo Act as announced by the [[Dalton McGuinty]] [[Government of Ontario|Government]] in June 2012.&lt;ref&gt;In ''Building a Better Condo Act'', [http://news.ontario.ca/mcs/en/2012/06/building-a-better-condominium-act.html Province of Ontario], June 8, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; COA represents and advocates for condominium owners and buyers. They are a growing force in Ontario with divisions across the province. The new Act has passed [[David Orazietti#Protecting Condominium Owners Act 2015 .C2.A0|first reading]].

The [[Association of Condominium Managers of Ontario]] is the  association of Professional [[Condominium Manager]]s across [[Ontario]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.acmo.org|title=Main Home|author=|date=|work=acmo.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Protecting Condominium Owners Act, 2015====
On May 27, 2015, [[David Orazietti]], Ontario's  [[Minister of Government and Consumer Services]],  introduced a new bill called Protecting Condominium Owners Act, 2015. The bill called for the creation of a new Condominium Authority, which would be funded   by a $1 a month fee on individual condo owners and by condo developers, that would provide advice for condo owners, facilitate dispute resolution between owners and boards regarding issues such as noise complaints, [[bylaw infraction]]s or an inability to get [[financial statement]]s from the [[board of director]]s. Critics of the bill said that the bill would result in increased fees and more special assessments. The aim of the Act is to make it less expensive to resolve disputes. The Act will require boards to issue reports to owners on things such as [[insurance]] or  [[legal proceeding]]s. Clear language will  spell out the amount of an adequate [[Reserve fund study]] and  help eliminate surprise hikes in [[condo fee]]s or [[special assessment]]s levied against each unit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Ontario condo owners to get cheaper way to resolve disputes |url=https://www.thestar.com/business/real_estate/2015/05/27/ontario-condo-owners-to-get-cheaper-way-to-resolve-disputes.html |first=Susan |last=Pigg |newspaper=Toronto Star |date=May 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/toronto-daystarter-wednesday-may-27-2015-1.3088981|title=Toronto Daystarter: Wednesday, May 27, 2015|author=|date=|work=cbc.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 2, 2015  [[Third Reading]] of this Act was [[Carried on division]] and on  December 3, 2015   [[Royal Assent]] was received,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ontla.on.ca/web/bills/bills_detail.do?locale=en&amp;BillID=3399&amp;detailPage=bills_detail_status|title=Legislative Assembly of Ontario - Bills &amp; Lawmaking - Current Parliament - Bill 106, Protecting Condominium Owners Act, 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Condo Manager Licensing Authority =====
The Act introduces a new body, the '''Condo Manager Licensing Authority'''. There will be training and licensing of [[condominium management companies]] and individuals to ensure those hired to run multimillion-dollar condominium corporations are adequately trained to reduce the risk of fraud and mismanagement.The Act also introduces a code of ethics for condo managers.There were 2,500 people managing  10,000 condominium developments in Ontario, with  700,000 individual units.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://business.financialpost.com/personal-finance/mortgages-real-estate/condo-disputes-in-ontario-will-be-less-costly-to-resolve-under-a-new-provincial-plan|title=Condo disputes in Ontario will be less costly to resolve under a new provincial plan|author=|date=|work=financialpost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Saskatchewan ==
In [[Saskatchewan]], condominiums are registered as a special type of non-profit corporation that is owned by the unit owners; the owners elect a board of directors; the operation of the corporation is governed by ''The Condominium Property Act, 1993''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|publisher = [[Queen's Printer]]
|accessdate = 2011-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism and controversy==
According to  [[Maclean]]'s:
:::Canadian condos are rife with internal politics, neighbour infighting and power struggles stemming from the complicated network of condo boards, owners, investors, tenants and property managers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macleans.ca/society/life/condo-hell/|title=Condo hell|author=|date=22 April 2014|work=macleans.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:DD classification 1988 dataset Cheibub visualized hanteng en.png|360px|right|thumb|Democracies and dictatorships in 1988{{R|Cheibub2010}}]]

'''Democracy-Dictatorship''' ('''DD'''){{R|Cheibub2010}}, '''index of democracy and dictatorship'''&lt;ref name= "GugiuCentellas 2013"/&gt; or simply the '''DD index'''&lt;ref name="Keech2013"/&gt; or the '''DD datasets''' refers to the binary measure of [[democracy]] and [[dictatorship]] first proposed by [[Adam Przeworski]] ''et al.'' (2010), and further developed and maintained by Cheibub, Gandhi, and Vreeland (2009).&lt;ref name= "Haggard&amp;Kaufman2013"/&gt;

Based on the regime binary classification idea proposed by Alvarez in 1996{{R|Alvarez1996}}, and the Democracy and Development (or DD measure, ACLP datatset) proposed by Przeworski ''et al.'' (2010), Cheibub, Gandhi, and Vreeland developed a six-fold regime classification scheme, resulting what the authors called as  the '''DD datasets'''.{{R|Cheibub2010|page1=68|quote1=The regime classification that appeared in Alvarez ''et al.'' (1996) served as the basis for the work in Przeworski ''et al.'' (2000) and has been variously referred to as the ACLP, the Przeworski, the Democracy and Development, or DD measure. Here we will use the latter, to denote the fact that it classifies political regimes asdemocracies or dictatorships. We will also refer to the dataset that accompanies this paper as the DD dataset.}}

The DD dataset covers the annual data points of 199 countries from 1946 (or date of independence) to 2008.{{R|Cheibub2010|page1=68|quote1=covering 199 countries from January 1, 1946 (or date of independence) to December 31, 2008}} The figures at the left show the results in 1998 and 2008.

==Six-fold regime classification scheme and its rules==
The DD index first classifies the regimes into two types: democracies and dictatorships. For democracies, it categorizes them into three types: parliamentary, semi-presidential and presidential democracies. For dictatorships, monarchic, military and civilian dictatorship.{{R|Cheibub2010}}

Based on a “minimalist” theory of democracy, the index relies on rules regarding the existence of competitive elections.{{R|Cheibub2010}}&lt;ref name="Keech2013"/&gt; Resorting to democratic concepts by [[Karl Popper]] and [[Joseph Schumpeter]], Przeworkski defended the minimalist approach, citing Popper that "the only system in which citizens can get rid of governments without bloodshed."{{R|Przeworkski 2003}}

===Four rules===
For a regime to be considered as a democracy by the DD scheme, it must meet the requirement of four rules below:{{R|Cheibub2010|page1=69|quote1=A regime is classified as a democracy if it meets the requirements stipulated in all of the following four rules:1. The chief executive must be chosen by popular election or by a body that was itself popularly elected. 2. The legislature must be popularly elected. 3. There must be more than one party competing in the elections. 4. An alternation in power under electoral rules identical to the ones that brought the incumbent to office must have taken place.}}&lt;ref name="Keech2013" /&gt;
{{quote|
#The chief executive must be chosen by popular election or by a body that was itself popularly elected. 
#The legislature must be popularly elected. 
#There must be more than one party competing in the elections. 
#An alternation in power under electoral rules identical to the ones that brought the incumbent to office must have taken place.
}}

Some regimes may meet the first three rules, but lack an alternation in power in its historical past; these regimes are classified as dictatorships and marked with a type II value, signalling potential classification errors where a democratic regime may be falsely classified as dictatorship{{R|Cheibub2010|page1=70|quote=But we also identify these cases through a variable called “Type II,” an indicator variable coded one if the dictatorship represents a possible Type II error—i.e., a false negative}}.

The authors acknowledged that the last rule is more complicated to implement but argued that it helps researchers to control potential errors and enhance the classification schemes' scientific reproducibility.{{R|Cheibub2010|page1=70|quote=The implementation of the last rule is more complicated since it requires that we make one assumption and one decision about what kind of error we are willing to accept. It does not, however, require any subjective judgment on the part of the analyst and hence does not compromise the classification’s reproducibility.}}

In DD dataset, the Type II variable does not indicate cases of semi-democracy or cases of semi-dictatorship.{{R|Cheibub2010|page1=71|quote1="This enables users of our dataset either to recode these cases as democracies—risking type I errors (false positives)—or to remove them from the analysis. Note that the Type II variable does not identify “intermediate” or “hybrid” cases, cases of semi-democracy or cases of semi-dictatorship. Under our conception of regime, all regimes are either democracy or dictatorship; but in these key cases we simply cannot tell which one given what we observe about the country (so far). "}}.

===The regimes with type2 value of 1 (2008)===
For the regimes with type2 of 1, the following list compares the similarities and contrasts between the 2008 data points from the DD dataset and the [[Polity data series|Polity IV]].{{R|Cheibub2010}}

==Comparison with other democracy-measuring data sets==
The DD dataset is limited to 199 countries after 1946, whereas Boix, Miller, &amp; Rosato, 2013 proposed a data set from 1800 to 2007, covering 219 countries. The 2010 version of [[Polity data series]] covers 189 countries from 1800 to 2009.&lt;ref name= "Boix, Miller, &amp; Rosato, 2013"/&gt;

Gugiu &amp; Centellas developed the [[Democracy Cluster Classification]] Index that integrates five democracy indicators (including the DD dataset, Polity dataset, etc.), clustering 24 American and 39 European regimes over 30 years.&lt;ref name= "GugiuCentellas 2013"/&gt;

{{Forms of government}}
'''Demokratia''' ({{lang-el|δημοκρατία}}) is a [[direct democracy]], as opposed to the modern [[representative democracy]].

It was used in ancient [[Greece]], most notably [[Athens]], and began its use around 500 BCE. In a participant government, citizens who wish to have a say in government can participate in it. Demokratia excluded women, foreigners, and slaves. It barred between 80 and 90 percent of the population from political rights.&lt;ref&gt;Morris &amp; Raaflaub ''Democracy 2500?: Questions and Challenges''&lt;/ref&gt;

The word demokratia comes from δῆμος ''demos'' "people" and ''kratos'' "power": "the people hold power." ''Demos'', including the lower classes, had political equality and notwhile respecting laws and institutions, was given full and absolute control of power and government."&lt;ref&gt;Morris &amp; Raaflaub ''Democracy 2500?: Questions and Challenges''p.34&lt;/ref&gt;

In some languages, including Finnish, Demokratia is a word simply meaning democracy.

Quoted from [https://web.archive.org/web/20070808234819/http://car.owu.edu/Vol.%2018%20No.%201.htm MODERN AMERICA AND THE RELIGION OF DEMOCRACY (Internet archive)] by Loren J Samons II:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
In classical Athens, religion suffused every aspect of public life, from the theater to the military to the political assembly. The state (that is, the citizens) sponsored religious festivals and actively participated in the propitiation and worship of the gods. This fact well illustrates the way the various aspects of Athenian society&amp;nbsp;— religious, political, economic, and social&amp;nbsp;— overlapped with and affected one another, and the way every Athenian found himself set firmly within a matrix of duties to the gods, to his family, and to his fellow citizens. The principle of necessary duties (especially to protect the family, to serve the polis, and to propitiate the gods) formed the basic structure of Athenian society, and gave meaning to each religious, economic, military, and political act. In such an environment, it was impossible for the Athenians abjectly to worship a form of government, demokratia, even after they had made it a goddess. The idea that the "freedom to make choices" or "diversity" were absolute goods and thus could serve as goals or ideals (on a level with, much less above, family, gods, or polis) contradicted the very premises of Athenian society. Thus while democratic practices ultimately had a marked and deleterious effect on Athenian national strength and public morale and arguably contributed to the loss of Athenian independence, Athenian society managed to stave off the most harmful aspects of democratic theory. Even after they lost their democracy and autonomy, there is little evidence that the Athenians completely lost their fundamental conception of a society based on the principle of duties.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

{{Basic Forms of government}}

'''Devolution''' is the [[statutory]] delegation of powers from the [[central government]] of a [[sovereign state]] to govern at a [[subnational]] level, such as a [[regional government|regional]] or [[local government|local]] level. It is a form of administrative [[decentralization]]. Devolved territories have the power to make [[legislation]] relevant to the area.

Devolution differs from [[federalism]] in that the devolved powers of the subnational authority may be temporary and are reversible, ultimately residing with the central government. Thus, the state remains ''[[de jure]]'' [[unitary state|unitary]]. [[Legislation]] creating devolved [[parliament]]s or [[Deliberative assembly|assemblies]] can be [[repeal]]ed or amended by central government in the same way as any statute. In [[federal system]]s, by contrast, sub-unit government is guaranteed in the [[constitution]], so the powers of the sub-units cannot be withdrawn unilaterally by the central government (i.e. without the consent of the sub-units being granted through the process of constitutional amendment). The sub-units therefore have a lower degree of protection under devolution than under [[federalism]].

==Australia==
[[Australia]] is a federation. It has six states and two territories with less power than states.

The [[Australian Capital Territory]] refused self-government in a 1978 referendum, but was given limited self-government by a [[Australian Capital Territory House of Assembly|House of Assembly]] from 1979, and a [[Australian Capital Territory Legislative Assembly|Legislative Assembly]] with wider powers in 1988.

The [[Northern Territory]] of Australia refused [[Government of the Northern Territory|statehood]] in a [[Northern Territory referendum, 1998|1998 referendum]]. The rejection was a surprise to both the Australian and Northern Territory governments.

Territory legislation can be disallowed by the Commonwealth Parliament in Canberra, with one notable example being the NT's short lived [[voluntary euthanasia]] [[Rights of the Terminally Ill Act 1995|legislation]].

==Canada==
Although [[Canada]] is a federal state, a large portion of its land mass in the north is under the legislative jurisdiction of the federal government. This has been the case since 1870. In 1870 the Rupert’s Land and North-Western Territory Order effected the admission of [[Rupert’s Land]] and the North-Western Territory to Canada, pursuant to section 146 of the ''Constitution Act, 1867'' and the ''Rupert’s Land Act, 1868''. The ''Manitoba Act, 1870'', which created [[Manitoba]] out of part of Rupert’s Land, also designated the remaining territories the Northwest Territories (NWT), over which Parliament was to exercise full legislative authority under the ''Constitution Act, 1871''.

Since the 1970s, the federal government has been transferring its decision-making powers to northern governments. This means greater local control and accountability by northerners for decisions central to the future of the territories. [[Yukon]] was carved from the Northwest Territories in 1898 but it remained a federal territory. Subsequently, in 1905, the provinces of [[Alberta, Canada|Alberta]] and [[Saskatchewan]] were created from the [[Northwest Territories]]. Other portions of [[Rupert's Land]] were added to the provinces of Ontario and Quebec, extending the provinces northward from their previous narrow band around the St. Lawrence and lower Great Lakes. The [[District of Ungava]] was a regional administrative district of Canada's Northwest Territories from 1895 to 1912. The continental areas of said district were transferred by the [[Parliament of Canada]] with the adoption of the ''Quebec Boundary Extension Act, 1898'' and the ''Quebec Boundaries Extension Act, 1912''. The status of the interior of Labrador which was believed part of Ungava was settled in 1927 by the British Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, which ruled in favour of [[Newfoundland]].

In 1999, the federal government created [[Nunavut]] pursuant to a land claim agreement reached with Inuit, the indigenous people of Canada’s Eastern Arctic. The offshore islands to the west and north of Quebec remained part of the Northwest Territories until the creation of Nunavut in 1999.

Since that time, the federal government has slowly devolved legislative jurisdiction to the territories. Enabling the territories to become more self-sufficient and prosperous and to play a stronger role in the Canadian federation is considered a key component to development in Canada’s North. Among the three territories, devolution is most advanced in Yukon.

===Northwest Territories===
The [[Northwest Territories]] (NWT) was governed from [[Ottawa]] from 1870 until the 1970s, except for the brief period between 1898 and 1905 when it was governed by an elected assembly. The [[Carrothers Commission]] was established in April 1963 by the government of [[Lester B. Pearson]] to examine the development of government in the NWT. It conducted surveys of opinion in the NWT in 1965 and 1966 and reported in 1966. Major recommendations included that the seat of government of the territories should be located in the territories. [[Yellowknife]] was selected as the territorial capital as a result. Transfer of many responsibilities from the federal government to that of the territories was recommended and carried out. This included responsibility for education, small business, public works, social services and local government. Since the report, the transfer of the government of Northwest Territories has taken over responsibilities for several other programs and services including the delivery of health care, social services, education, administration of airports, and forestry management. The legislative jurisdiction of the territorial legislature is set out in section 16 of the Northwest Territories Act.

Now, the government of Canada is negotiating the transfer of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development's remaining provincial-type responsibilities in the NWT. These include the legislative powers, programs and responsibilities for land and resources associated with the department's Northern Affairs Program (NAP) with respect to:

* Powers to develop, conserve, manage, and regulate of surface and subsurface natural resources in the NWT for mining and minerals (including oil and gas) administration, water management, land management and environmental management;
* Powers to control and administer public land with the right to use, sell or otherwise dispose of such land; and
* Powers to levy and collect resource royalties and other revenues from natural resources.

The Government of the Northwest Territories, the Aboriginal Summit and the Government of Canada have each appointed a Chief Negotiator to work on devolution. A Framework Agreement was concluded in 2004. The target date for the completion of devolution talks for the NWT was March 2007. However, stumbling blocks associated with the transfer of current federal employees to the territorial government, and the unresolved issue of how much money the Northwest Territories will receive for its resources has delayed the conclusion of a devolution agreement for the NWT.

===Nunavut===
In 1966, the federal government established the [[Carrothers Commission|Carruthers Commission]] to look at the issue of government in the north. After extensive study and consultation, the Commission concluded that division of the NWT was probably both advisable and inevitable. There was a recognition that Northerners wanted to run their own affairs and must be given the opportunity to do so. At the same time, however, it noted that governmental reform was required before this could happen. It recommended the establishment of a new system of representative government. As a result, in the late 1960s and in the 1970s, the federal government gradually created electoral constituencies and transferred many federally run programs to the territorial government. Northerners took on more and more responsibility for the day-to-day running of their own affairs.
In 1982 a [[plebiscite]] was held in the NWT asking the question, "Do you think the NWT should be divided?" Fifty-three percent of eligible voters participated in the plebiscite, with 56.4 percent of them voting "yes". Voter turnout and support for division was particularly strong in the Eastern Arctic. The Inuit population of the eastern section of the territory had become increasingly receptive of the idea of self-government. It was viewed as the best way to promote and protect their culture and traditions and address their unique regional concerns.

Both the NWT Legislative Assembly and the federal government accepted the idea of dividing the territory. The idea was viewed as an important step towards enabling the [[Inuit]], and other residents of the Eastern Arctic, to take charge of their own destiny. There were some reservations, however. Before action could be taken, certain practical considerations had to be addressed. First of all, outstanding land claims had to be settled. Second, all parties had to agree on a new boundary. Finally, all parties had to agree on the division of powers between territorial, regional and local levels of government. The various governments and native groups worked closely together to realize these goals.
The ''[[Nunavut Land Claims Agreement]]'' was ratified by the Inuit in November 1992, signed by the Prime Minister of Canada on May 25, 1993, and passed by the Canadian Parliament in June of the same year. It was the largest native land claim settlement in Canadian history. It gave the Inuit title over 350,000 square kilometres of land. It also gave the Inuit capital transfers from the federal government of over $1.1&amp;nbsp;billion over the next 14 years. This money will be held in trust with the interest to be used in a variety of different projects, including financing for regional businesses and scholarships for students. The Inuit also gained a share of resource royalties, hunting rights and a greater role in managing the land and protecting the environment. The land claims agreement also committed the Government of Canada to recommend to Parliament legislation to create a new territory in the eastern part of the Northwest Territories.

While negotiations on a land claims settlement progressed, work was also taking place to determine potential jurisdictional boundaries for a new Eastern Territory. A proposal was presented to all NWT voters in a May 1992 plebiscite. Of those voting, 54 percent supported the proposed boundary. The Government of the Northwest Territories, the Tungavik Federation of Nunavut (the Inuit claims organization) and the federal government formally adopted the boundary for division in the Nunavut Political Accord.
The final piece of the equation fit into place on June 10, 1993, when the Nunavut Act received Royal Assent. It officially established the territory of Nunavut and provided a legal framework for its government. It fixed April 1, 1999, as the day on which the new territory would come into existence.

The government of [[Nunavut]] is currently negotiating with the government of Canada on a devolution agreement. [[Nunavut Tunngavik]], the organization of Inuit of Nunavut, is also a participant to negotiations to ensure that Inuit interests are represented.

Devolution over natural resources to the government of [[Nunavut]] moved forward with the appointment of a Ministerial Representative for Nunavut Devolution. The Representative has held meetings with interested parties including the Boards established under the [[Nunavut Land Claims Agreement]] (NLCA), territorial and federal government departments in order to determine if devolution will occur and if so the future mandate of devolution. The government of Nunavut and Nunavut Tunngavik have appointed negotiators.

===Yukon===
In 1896 prospectors discovered gold in [[Yukon]]. There ensued what is often considered{{by whom?|date=October 2017}} the world's greatest [[Klondike Gold Rush|gold rush]], which saw the population of Yukon grow rapidly. Indeed, by 1898, [[Dawson City, Yukon|Dawson]] grew into the largest Canadian city west of [[Winnipeg]], with a population of 40,000. In response, the Canadian government officially established the Yukon Territory in 1898. The [[North-West Mounted Police]] were sent in to ensure Canadian jurisdiction and the Yukon Act provided for a commissioner to administer the territory. The 1898 statute granted the Commissioner in Council "the same powers to make ordinances... as are possessed by the Lieutenant Governor of the North-west Territories, acting by and with the advice and consent of the Legislative Assembly thereof". In 1908 amendments to the Yukon Act transformed the Council into an elected body.

Over time the territorial government exercised expanded functions. Relevant developments include the following:

* By the mid-1960s, schools, public works, welfare, and various other matters of a local nature had come under territorial administration.
* Increased authority of elected Council members over the ensuing period contributed to significant changes in the Yukon Commissioner's role. In 1979, instructions from the [[Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development]] (Minister) directed the Commissioner to allow elected members and the Executive Council to make important policy decisions, specifying that his/her actions should normally be based on the advice and taken with the consent of the elected Executive Council.
* As in the Northwest Territories, federal responsibilities were transferred to the Yukon government in the 1980s. In 1988 the Minister and the Yukon Government Leader signed a [[Memorandum of Understanding]] committing the parties to smooth the progress of devolution of remaining province-like responsibilities to the Yukon Government. Responsibilities transferred since then include fisheries, mine safety, intra-territorial roads, hospitals and community-health care, oil-and-gas and, most recently, natural resources.
* Discussion to transfer land- and resource-management responsibilities to the [[Legislature of Yukon|Yukon Government]] began in 1996, followed by a formal federal devolution proposal to the Yukon Government in January 1997. In September 1998 a Devolution Protocol Accord to guide devolution negotiations was signed. On August 28, 2001 a final draft of the Devolution Transfer Agreement was completed for consideration. The Yukon Devolution transfer Agreement was concluded on October 29, 2001, with the Government of Canada enabling the transfer of remaining province-like responsibilities for land, water and resource management to the Government of Yukon on April 1, 2003.

==Mexico==

===The Federal District===
All constituent [[political divisions of Mexico|states of Mexico]] are fully autonomous and comprise a federation. The Federal District, originally integrated by [[Mexico City]] and other municipalities, was created in 1824 to be the capital of the federation. As such, it was governed directly by the central or federal government and the [[president of Mexico]] appointed its governor or executive regent. Even though the municipalities within the Federal District were autonomous, their powers were limited. In 1928, these municipalities were abolished and transformed into non-autonomous ''[[delegación|delegaciones]]'' or boroughs and a "Central Department", later renamed as Mexico City. In 1970 this department was split into four new ''delegaciones'', and Mexico City was constitutionally defined to be synonymous and coterminous with the entire Federal District.&lt;ref&gt;[http://constitucion.gob.mx/index.php?art_id=44 Article 44, Political Constitution of the United Mexican States, Second Title, Second Chapter, 44th article]&lt;/ref&gt; (As such, the [[boroughs of the Mexican Federal District|boroughs of the Federal District]] are boroughs of Mexico City).

In the 1980s, the citizens of the Federal District, being the most populated federal entity in Mexico, began to demand for home rule; a devolution of autonomy in order to directly elect their head of government and to set up a Legislative Assembly. In 1987, an Assembly of Representatives was created, by constitutional decree, whose members were elected by popular vote.  The devolution of the executive power was not granted until 1997 when the first [[head of Government of the Federal District|head of government]] was elected by popular vote. Finally, in 2000, power was devolved to the ''delegaciones'', though limited: residents can now elect their own "heads of borough government" (''jefes delegacionales'', in Spanish), but the ''delegaciones'' do not have regulatory powers and are not constituted by a board of trustees, like the [[municipalities of Mexico|municipalities of the constituent states]].

The autonomy, or home rule, of the Federal District, was granted by the federal government, which in principle, has the right to remove it. The president of Mexico still holds the final word in some decisions (e.g. he must approve some posts), and the [[Congress of Mexico|Congress of the Union]] reviews the budget of the Federal District and sets the limit to its debt.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finanzas.df.gob.mx/documentos/CodigoFinanciero_2007.pdf Código Financiero del Distrito Federal]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some left-wing groups and political parties have advocated, since the 1980s, for a full devolution of powers by transforming the Federal District into the thirty-second constituent state of the Federation (with the proposed name of "State of the Valley of Mexico", to be distinguished from the [[state of México]]. Another proposed name is "State of the Anahuac").

===Indigenous peoples===
In a recent amendment to the [[Constitution of Mexico]], the country was defined as a "pluricultural nation" founded upon the "indigenous peoples".&lt;ref&gt;[http://info4.juridicas.unam.mx/ijure/fed/9/3.htm?s= Second Article of the Political Constitution of the United Mexican States] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070811193236/http://info4.juridicas.unam.mx/ijure/fed/9/3.htm?s= |date=2007-08-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They are granted "free-determination" to choose the social, economic, cultural and political organization for which they are to elect representatives democratically in whatever manner they see fit, traditionally or otherwise, as long as women have the same opportunities to participate in their social and political life. There are, however, no prescribed limits to their territories, and they are still under the jurisdiction of the municipalities and states in which they are located; the indigenous peoples can elect representatives before the municipal councils. In practice, they are allowed to have an autonomous form of self-government, but they are still subject to the rights and responsibilities set forth by the federal constitution and the constitution of the states in which they are located.

==France==
{{main article|Décentralisation in France}}

In the late 1980s a process of [[decentralisation]] was undertaken by the French government. Initially regions were created and elected regional assemblies set up. Together with the departmental councils these bodies have responsibility for infrastructure spending and maintenance (schools and highways) and certain social spending. They collect revenues through property taxes and various other taxes. In addition a large part of spending is provided by direct grants to such authorities.

There also are groups calling for devolution or full independence for [[Occitania]], [[Alsace]], and [[Brittany]].

==Spain==
{{main article|Nationalities and regions of Spain}}

The [[Spanish Constitution]] of 1978 granted [[self-government|autonomy]] to the ''nationalities'' and regions of which the [[Kingdom of Spain]] is composed. (See also ''[[autonomous communities of Spain|autonomous communities]] and [[autonomous cities of Spain|cities of Spain]]'')

Under the "system of autonomies" ({{lang-es|Estado de las Autonomías}}), Spain has been quoted to be "remarkable for the extent of the powers peacefully devolved over the past 30 years"&lt;ref name="Mallet"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/de6c00f0-8c25-11de-b14f-00144feabdc0.html|title=Flimsier footings|last=Mallet|first=Victor|date=18 August 2010|publisher=''Financial Times''|accessdate=25 August 2010}}{{Registration required}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "an extraordinarily decentralised country", with the central government accounting for just 18% of public spending; the regional governments 38%, the local councils 13% and the social-security system the rest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/specialreports/displaystory.cfm?story_id=12501023|title=A survey of Spain: How much is enough?|publisher=The Economist|accessdate=25 August 2010|date=6 November 2008}}{{Subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 the Constitutional Court had ruled  that non-binding referendums could be held and subsequently several municipalities held such referendums.{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}}

On December 12, 2013 the [[Government of Catalonia|Catalan Government]] announced that a [[Catalan self-determination referendum, 2014|referendum]] would be held on self-determination. The central government of Spain considers that a binding referendum is unconstitutional and cannot be held.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-25353086|title=Spain to block Catalonia independence referendum|date=2013-12-12|newspaper=BBC News|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 1, 2017 the regional government held a referendum despite having been declared illegal by the Spanish courts. Subsequently, several leaders were arrested and imprisoned on charges of "sedition" and "rebellion". The regional president fled to Brussels, but has so far escaped extradition as those offenses are not part of Belgian law or the European Arrest Warrant.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-20345071 BBC Catalonia region profile]&lt;/ref&gt; On December 21, 2017 fresh elections were held in which pro-independence parties held a slim majority and a broad coalition of constitutionalist parties expressed disappointment and concern for the future.

==United Kingdom==
{{main article|Devolution in the United Kingdom}}

In the [[United Kingdom]], devolved government was created following [[majority|simple majority]] [[referendum|referenda]] in [[Wales]] and [[Scotland]] in September 1997 and in [[London]] in May 1998. Between 1998 and 1999, the [[Scottish Parliament]], [[National Assembly for Wales]], [[Northern Ireland Assembly]] and [[London Assembly]] were established by law. The [[Campaign for an English Parliament]], which supports [[English devolution]] (i.e. the establishment of a separate English parliament or assembly) was formed in 1998.

A referendum was held in Scotland on 18 September 2014 which asked citizens whether Scotland should be an independent country.&lt;ref name="BBC 2013-03-21"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-16478121|title=Salmond calls for independence referendum in 2014 |date=10 January 2012|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=30 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; By a margin of approximately 55 percent to 45 percent, people living in Scotland rejected the proposal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.bbc.com/news/events/scotland-decides|title = Scotland votes no to independence|date = September 19, 2014|accessdate = September 19, 2014|website = BBC News - Scotland decides|publisher = BBC|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The leaders of the three largest British political parties pledged on 16 September 2014 a new devolution settlement for Scotland in the event of a No vote, promising to deliver “faster, safer and better change”,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/scottish-independence/scottish-independence-cameron-miliband-and-clegg-sign-devolution-vow-but-scots-sceptical-9736090.html|title=Scottish independence: Cameron, Miliband and Clegg sign devolution|date=2014-09-16|newspaper=The Independent|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as a result of this vote and promises made during the referendum campaign, British Prime Minister David Cameron announced plans to devolve additional powers to the Scottish government, the nature of which would be determined by the [[Smith Commission]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/sep/19/scottish-referendum-david-cameron-devolution-revolution|title=Scottish Referendum David Cameron Devolution Revolution|accessdate=19 September 2014|publisher=The Guardian|date=19 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; These powers were subsequently transferred in the [[Scotland Act 2016]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2016/11/contents/enacted|title=Scotland Act 2016|publisher=legislation.gov.uk|date=2016|accessdate=11 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the outcome of the [[United Kingdom European Union membership referendum]] on 23 June 2016, calls for further devolution have been raised,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-36747715|title=Growing calls for federal UK in wake of Brexit vote|last=Taylor|first=Brian|date=2016-07-09|newspaper=BBC News|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; including differential membership of the [[European single market]] for the devolved areas of the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/dec/20/nicola-sturgeon-make-scotlands-place-in-single-market-integral-to-talks|title=Nicola Sturgeon: make Scotland's place in single market 'integral' to talks|last=correspondent|first=Libby Brooks Scotland|date=2016-12-20|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|access-date=2017-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States==
{{see also|State constitution (United States)|Home Rule in the United States|Municipal corporation}}

In the United States only the federal government and state governments are sovereign. Legal relationships with Indian tribes and their government structures are the jurisdiction of the federal government. Territories are under the direct jurisdiction of Congress. Territorial governments are thus devolved by acts of Congress. Political  subdivisions of a state, such as a county or municipality, are a type of devolved government and are defined by individual state constitutions and laws. 

===District of Columbia===
{{Main article|District of Columbia home rule}}
In the United States, the [[District of Columbia]] offers an illustration of devolved government. The District is separate from any state, and has its own elected government; in many ways, on a day-to-day basis, it operates much like another state, with its own laws, court system, Department of Motor Vehicles, public university, and so on. However, the governments of the 50 states reserved a broad range of powers in the [[U.S. Constitution]], and most of their laws cannot be voided by any act of U.S. federal government. The District of Columbia, by contrast, is constitutionally under the sole control of the [[United States Congress]], which created the current District government by statute. Any law passed by the District legislature can be nullified by congressional action, and indeed the District government could be significantly altered or eliminated entirely by a simple majority vote in Congress.

The '''Federal Marriage Amendment''' ('''FMA''') (also referred to by proponents as the '''Marriage Protection Amendment''') was a proposed [[Article Five of the United States Constitution|amendment]] to the [[United States Constitution]] that would define [[marriage]] in the [[United States]] as a union of one man and one woman. The FMA would also prevent judicial extension of marriage rights to [[same-sex couple|same-sex]] or other unmarried heterosexual couples. An amendment to the U.S. Constitution requires the support of two thirds of each house of Congress and ratification by three fourths of the states. The last Congressional vote on the proposed amendment occurred in the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] on July 18, 2006, when the motion failed 236 to 187, falling short of the 290 votes required for passage in that body. The [[United States Senate|Senate]] has only voted on [[cloture]] motions with regard to the proposed amendment, the last of which was on June 7, 2006, when the motion failed 49 to 48, falling short of the 60 votes required to allow the Senate to proceed to consideration of the proposal and the 67 votes required to send the proposed amendment to the states for ratification.

==Background and current law==
{{Refimprove section|date=January 2009}}

===Role of states===
In the United States, civil marriage is governed by [[state law]]. Each state is free to set the conditions for a valid marriage, subject to limits set by the state's own constitution and the [[United States Constitution|U.S. Constitution]]. Traditionally, a marriage was considered valid if the requirements of the marriage law of the state where the marriage took place were fulfilled. (First Restatement of Conflicts on Marriage and Legitimacy s.121 (1934)). However, a state can refuse to recognize a marriage if the marriage violates a strong public policy of the state, even if the marriage was legal in the state where it was performed. (Restatement (Second) Of Conflict of Laws § 283(2) (1971).) States historically exercised this "public policy exception" by refusing to recognize out-of-state polygamous marriages, underage marriages, incestuous marriages, and interracial marriages. Following the Windsor decision in 2013, nearly all courts that have addressed the issue have held that states with laws defining marriage as a one-man, one-woman union cannot refuse to recognize same-sex marriages that were legally performed elsewhere and must permit all people, regardless of gender or sexual orientation, the right to marry.

Same-sex marriage is currently legal in [[Same-sex marriage in the United States#Tables|all US States]].  In 2003 and 2008 respectively, the [[Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court|Massachusetts]] and [[Supreme Court of California|California]] Supreme courts ruled in ''[[Goodridge v. Department of Public Health]]'' and ''[[In Re Marriage Cases]]'' that the states' constitutions required the state to permit same-sex marriage. The Massachusetts decision could be reversed by an amendment to the state constitution; to date, no such amendment has successfully been passed in Massachusetts. On June 2, the [[California Proposition 8|''California Marriage Protection Act'']], commonly referred to as Prop 8 qualified for the 2008 General Election ballot.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/elections_j.htm#2008General California 2008 General Election ballot propositions] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090617213215/http://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/elections_j.htm |date=June 17, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Voted into law on November 4, 2008, it amended the California Constitution to provide that "Only marriage between a man and a woman is valid or recognized in California". Prop 8 was later found to be unconstitutional and marriage equality took effect.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ag.ca.gov/cms_pdfs/initiatives/i737_07-0068_Initiative.pdf California Marriage Protection Act]&lt;/ref&gt;  Thirty states passed state constitutional amendments defining marriage as being between one man and one woman.  On June 26, 2015, all amendments banning sex-same marriage were invalidated by the Supreme Court's ruling on ''[[Obergefell v. Hodges]]''.

Although individual U.S. states have the primary regulatory power with regard to marriage, the [[United States Congress]] has occasionally regulated marriage. The 1862 [[Morrill Anti-Bigamy Act]], which made bigamy a punishable federal offense in U.S. territories, was followed by a series of federal laws designed to end the practice of polygamy. In 1996 as a reaction to a state level judicial ruling prohibiting same-sex couples from marrying that may violate Hawaii's constitutional equal protection clause (Baehr v. Miike, 80 Hawai`i 341), Congress passed the [[Defense of Marriage Act]] (DOMA), section 3 of which defined marriage as a legal union of one man and one woman for the purpose of interpreting federal law. Under DOMA section 3, the federal government did not recognize same-sex marriages, even if those unions were recognized by state law. For example, members of a same-sex couple legally married in Massachusetts could not file joint [[Income tax in the United States|federal income tax returns]] even if they filed joint [[State income tax|state income tax returns]]. DOMA section 3 was struck down by the U.S. Supreme Court in ''[[United States v. Windsor]]'' on June 26, 2013.

===The United States Constitution and federal courts===
Federal courts have interpreted the U.S. Constitution to place some limits on states' ability to restrict access to marriage. In ''[[Loving v. Virginia]]'', the United States Supreme Court overturned state marriage laws that barred interracial marriages on the basis that marriage is a "basic civil right..." and that "...the freedom to marry, or not marry, a person of another race resides with the individual and cannot be infringed by the State." The Supreme Court struck down a 1992 Colorado constitutional amendment that barred legislative and judicial remedies to protect homosexuals from discrimination solely on the basis of their sexual orientation in ''[[Romer v. Evans]]''.

In 1972, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] dismissed, "for want of a substantial question," an appeal by two men who unsuccessfully challenged Minnesota's marriage statutes in state court. Because the case, ''[[Baker v. Nelson]],'' came to the Court through mandatory appellate review (not ''[[certiorari]]''), the summary dismissal established ''Baker v. Nelson'' as a binding precedent.&lt;ref&gt;Project, ''Developments in the Law: The Constitution and the Family,'' 93 Harv. L. Rev. 1156, 1274 (1980) (discussing ''Baker's'' posture as precedent); ''see, e.g.'' Pamela R. Winnick, Comment, ''The Precedential Weight of a Dismissal by the Supreme Court for Want of a Substantial Federal Question: Some Implications of Hicks v. Miranda,'' 76 Colum. L. Rev. 508, 511 (1976); ''Baker v. Nelson,'' 409 U.S. 810 (1972).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of California]] ruled&lt;ref&gt;http://msnbcmedia.msn.com/i//MSNBC/Sections/NEWS/A_U.S.%20news/Life/gaymarriage.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; that Proposition 8, passed two years earlier by a majority of voters, was unconstitutional. As in Judge Baitaillon's decision about the Nebraska law, Judge [[Vaughn Walker]] stated in his ruling that moral opposition to same-sex marriage is not sufficient reason to make a law valid. Judge Walker ruled the law violated the 14th Amendment's Equal Protection clause, as well as the Due Process Clause. The proponents of Proposition 8 appealed to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]], which affirmed the lower court's decision on February 7, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hagan |first=Robyn |url=https://blogs.findlaw.com/ninth_circuit/2012/02/perry-v-brown-ninth-circuit-says-prop-8-is-unconstitutional.html |title=Perry v.

Two days later the Ninth Circuit dissolved its stay of the district court's ruling, allowing same-sex marriage to resume in California.&lt;ref name="latimes.com"&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-prop-8-gay-marriage-20130628,0,1889039.story Prop 8: Gay marriages can resume in California, court rules]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015 the Supreme Court held in ''[[Obergefell v. Hodges]]'' that the government could not refuse to recognize same-sex marriage.

==Legislative history==
The Federal Marriage Amendment has been introduced in the [[United States Congress]] many different times: in 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2008, 2013, and 2015.

The bill was introduced in the Senate by Senator [[Wayne Allard]] ([[Republican Party (United States)|R]]-[[Colorado|Colo.]]) on November 25, 2003, and designated S.J.Res.26. The amendment changed the language of the proposed amendment, substituting "marriage" for "marital status" and specifying that it applied to "any union other than the union of a man and a woman" rather than "unmarried couples or groups". The changes were intended to make it clear that state legislatures could still recognize civil unions if the amendment were to pass. "This new language makes the intent of the legislation even clearer: to protect marriage in this country as the union between a man and a woman, and to reinforce the authority of state legislatures to determine benefits issues related to civil unions or domestic partnerships," said Sen. Wayne Allard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Federal Marriage Amendment Reworded to Allow Civil Unions|url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2004/marchweb-only/3-22-22.0.html|accessdate=August 3, 2013|newspaper=Christianity Today|date=March 1, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was immediately referred to the [[United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary|Senate Committee on the Judiciary]].&lt;ref name=sjres26/&gt;

===Bush administration's stance===
In 2003, the White House declined to take a stand on the amendment, although Press Secretary [[Ari Fleischer]] relayed that President [[George W.

===Influence on 2004 presidential election===
By the time Americans went to the polls, [[John Kerry]] opposed the Federal Marriage Amendment and affirmatively supported civil unions, while [[George W.

Previously, on February 24, 2004, Bush called for an amendment which would have outlawed same-sex marriage, and which would have disallowed states from recognizing or enforcing same-sex civil unions. Bush's statement included a requirement that any amendment "leav[e] the state legislatures free to make their own choices in defining legal arrangements other than marriage."&lt;ref&gt;Bush, George W.

Retrieved June 30, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; with White House Press Secretary [[Scott McClellan]], who stated that by calling on the FMA to permit states the possibility of creating other "legal arrangements," Bush specifically meant to permit states the chance of enacting civil unions. (McClellan also stated, however, that Bush did not personally support civil unions.) Similarly, at the February 25, 2004 press conference,&lt;ref&gt;McClellan, Scott.

Retrieved June 30, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; McClellan stated that the White House intended to work with Congress to develop language for the FMA that permitted states to enact civil unions. Although Bush frequently spoke about FMA on the campaign from February and November 2004, he avoided mention of the phrase "civil unions" until an ABC News interview of October 26, 2004, aired one week before the election.&lt;ref&gt;(October 26, 2004) [http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6338458/ "Bush's gay union stance irks conservatives"] [[Associated Press]]. Retrieved June 30, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

The FMA's Republican co-sponsors, Senator [[Wayne Allard]] (R-CO) and Representative [[Marilyn Musgrave]] (R-CO), announced new language for the proposed amendment on March 23, 2004, replacing the second sentence of the amendment with "Neither this Constitution, nor the constitution of any State, shall be construed to require that marriage or the legal incidents thereof be conferred upon any union other than the union of a man and a woman." Both Allard and Musgrave called the change purely "technical."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.religioustolerance.org/mar_amend4.htm Federal Marriage Amendment to the U.S. Constitution: Recent events up to 2004 MAY] ReligiousTolerance.org. Retrieved June 30, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Opponents of the FMA claim polling of the public has shown a cautious response, with many polls indicating opposition, even in states such as [[Arizona]] and [[Colorado]] which are normally thought of as socially conservative. They cite [[Pew Research Center]] exit polls from the 2004 elections finding that 25% of polled voters support same-sex marriage and another 35% support civil unions.&lt;ref&gt;Goodstein, Laurie; Yardley, William.

Retrieved April 26, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, of the 11 states in which amendments defining marriage were on the ballot, all passed handily. Bush won in nine, including [[Ohio]]. Interpretation of some exit polling suggests that the amendments may have brought out one million additional voters, most of which came out for the first time to cast their ballots for Bush.&lt;!-- Dead Link&lt;ref&gt;[http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&amp;u=/afp/20041105/ts_alt_afp/us_vote_bush_religion&amp;cid=1506&amp;ncid=1963&amp;sid=96378801]&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt; Notably, a vast majority of these states have not voted for a Democrat in many years. The two states that Bush did not win, Michigan and Oregon, still passed amendments limiting official recognition of marriage to one man one woman unions.

However, Roberta Combs, President of the Christian Coalition of America claims, "Christian evangelicals made the major difference once again this year." In the [[United States presidential election, 2000|2000 Presidential Election]], there was some speculation that many evangelicals did not go to the polls and vote because of the [[October surprise]] of George W. Bush's drunk-driving arrest record. In a dozen swing states that decided the presidential election, moral values tied with the economy and jobs as the top issue in the campaign, according to Associated Press exit polls.&lt;!-- Dead Link&lt;ref&gt;https://news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&amp;u=/ap/20041104/ap_on_el_pr/eln_how_bush_won_2&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;

==Arguments against the Federal Marriage Amendment==
:''This section contains arguments specific to the Federal Marriage Amendment. For arguments for and against same-sex marriage in general, see [[Same-sex marriage#Controversies]]''

The first sentence of H.J. Res. 56 would provide an official definition of legal marriage in the United States. Proponents{{Who|date=June 2010}} claim that this is a reasonable measure, based on established custom, which defends the family and the institution of marriage.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} To others, it is an unfair means of excluding same-sex couples from receiving benefits from that institution. Civil right activists and supporters of the LGBT (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender) community feel that the Federal Marriage Amendment has no place in the United States constitution.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

===Federalism===
Opponents of the FMA argue that it would violate the [[states' rights]] to regulate marriage by [[Federal government of the United States|federalizing]] the issue, which they say should be left to the states. Many have used the federalism argument, including Senator [[John Kerry]], Senator [[John McCain]], and Representative [[Ron Paul]], who opposes the FMA for several reasons, one of which that regulating marriage is not a proper role of the federal government. Constitutionally defining marriage would not only remove the states' choice, but it would reverse the choices already made in some states and territories, i.e., Massachusetts, Vermont, Connecticut, New Hampshire, New York, Iowa, and the District of Columbia.

===Unmarried heterosexual couples===
It is argued that the 2002 version of the FMA would have severely affected the ability of heterosexual unmarried couples to seek some degree of legal protection and/or provisions.&lt;ref&gt;(May 28, 2003) [https://www.aclu.org/lgbt/relationships/11820res20030528.html "Marriage Amendment: Oppose Writing Intolerance into the Constitution"], [[American Civil Liberties Union]]. Retrieved June 30, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Opponents of the FMA argue that it may complicate efforts to enforce laws against [[domestic abuse]] in [[heterosexual]] relationships involving unmarried couples.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legalmomentum.org/congress/FMADV2pager060206.pdf "Passage of the Federal Marriage Amendment will harm victims of domestic violence"] [[Legal Momentum]]. Retrieved August 13, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;
They note that two Ohio courts ruled that Ohio's similar amendment made the state's domestic violence laws unconstitutional as applied to unmarried couples, because they created a "quasi-marital relationship". (although the decisions were later reversed).&lt;ref&gt;Bischoff, Laura A. (October 15, 2006) [http://www.middletownjournal.com/hp/content/oh/story/news/local/2006/10/15/mj101606carswellinside.html "Challenge to gay marriage ban makes some unlikely bedfellows: Top court must decide if unwed couples can be treated as spouses in domestic-violence cases."] ''Middletown Journal''. Retrieved August 18, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  Supporters of the FMA assert that this argument was an invalid scare tactic from the outset and that the FMA would not prevent laws against domestic abuse from being applied to unmarried couples.&lt;ref name="McDonnell"&gt;McDonnell, Robert F.

Retrieved August 18, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In Ohio, 8 of the 10 Ohio Courts that addressed the effect of the State Amendment on Domestic Violence Laws found no conflict.

===Separation of church and state===
Some religious groups argue that having the government decide whether a same-sex marriage should be legally binding on the grounds of the ideology of other religious groups restricts their religious freedom. They argue that marriage is a religious term that should not be defined by the government. Where same-sex marriage is recognized in the United States, no church or other religious institution is forced to perform same-sex marriages, but the FMA would deny the opportunity for religions which approve of same-sex marriage to perform legally binding same-sex marriages.

===Unnecessary and ineffective===
Opponents of the FMA have claimed that life for those in a heterosexual marriage are not materially affected by a constitutional marriage definition or legalization of same-sex marriage. They stated that the FMA was totally unnecessary because federal and state laws, combined with the state of the relevant constitutional doctrines at the time, already made court-ordered nationwide same-sex marriage unlikely for the foreseeable future. It was claimed therefore, that such an amendment was a solution in search of a problem. It was claimed that neither federal nor state courts were likely to order same-sex marriage under the traditional interpretation of the Constitution's [[Full Faith and Credit Clause]]. Nor, for the foreseeable future, it was claimed, were courts likely to mandate same-sex marriage under substantive federal constitutional doctrines, such as the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause or the Equal Protection Clause. However, in light of the legalisation of same-sex marriage in several states since 2012, this claim is no longer true.

===Institution of Marriage Amendment===
The Concerned Women for America (CWA) were concerned about the wording of the 2004 Federal Marriage Amendment. CWA did not support the language in the amendment because the second sentence is open to differing interpretations, and its drafters acknowledged that it was specifically worded so state legislators could create civil unions and domestic partnerships, because the CWA opposes any legal recognition of same-sex couples. CWA preferred the Institution of Marriage Amendment crafted by Home School Legal Defense Association President Michael Farris. That amendment, which has not been introduced by any member of Congress, states:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bpnews.net/BPnews.asp?ID=17217 Should a marriage amendment also ban civil unions?]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arguments in favor of the Federal Marriage Amendment==
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2009}}
:''This section contains arguments specific to the Federal Marriage Amendment. For arguments for and against same-sex marriage in general, see [[Same-sex marriage#Controversies]]''

===Restriction of perceived judicial overreach===
Proponents of the FMA initially argued that if it were not for judicial overreach, there would be no need for an FMA; states' rights would not be violated since no state legislatures had recognized same-sex marriage. However, by the end of 2012, a number of states had enacted same-sex marriage both through the actions of their state legislatures ([[Same-sex marriage in Vermont|Vermont]], [[Same-sex marriage in New Hampshire|New Hampshire]], [[Same-sex marriage in New York|New York]]), and through popular vote ([[Same-sex marriage in Maine|Maine]], [[Same-sex marriage in Maryland|Maryland]], [[Same-sex marriage in Washington|Washington]]).

Prior to these legislative enactments and popular vote outcomes, proponents of the FMA argues that the federalism proposed by the opponents of a constitutional amendment was a contrivance for permitting federal courts to force same-sex marriage upon the whole nation, no matter what the people of the individual states desire. Proponents supported this claim with ''[[Citizens for Equal Protection v. Bruning]]'', in which a district court struck down Nebraska's marriage amendment, even though it had been passed by a margin of seventy percent (although the amendment was later reinstated.)  Opponents of the FMA argued that no federal court has ever ordered a state to permit same-sex marriage.  However, on February 7, 2012 a federal appeals court in a 2-to-1 decision threw out California's voter-approved restriction on same-sex marriage (Proposition 8) saying that it violated the Equal Protection clause of the U.S. Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Nagourney|first=Adam|title=Court Strikes Down Ban on Gay Marriage in California|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/08/us/marriage-ban-violates-constitution-court-rules.html|accessdate=July 2, 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=July 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Uniform application of Full Faith and Credit===
Under the [[Full Faith and Credit Clause]], with certain exceptions, a state is obligated to honor the judgments and declarations of other states. While some assert that a "license" could be construed as a "judgment", the majority of legal scholars disagree. However, it is pointed out that a judgment for divorce is required to be honored because judgments are required to be enforced by out-of-state jurisdictions, regardless of whether those judgments are against the public policy of the out state forum (see ''Williams v. North Carolina'', 317 U.S. 287 (1942) (the case also stated that there is no "authority which lends support to the view that the full faith and credit clause compels the courts of one state to subordinate the local policy of that state, as respects its domiciliaries, to the statutes of any other state")). Because of the intricacies of family law and the mobility of married couples, the recognition of marriages in other states varies. The need for clarification on state uniformity in this issue requires a constitutional amendment at the federal level, particularly considering there will be a flood of marriages in out-of-state jurisdictions for purposes of obtaining a same-sex marriage license.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

===Protection of conjugal marriage===
FMA proponents argue that opposite-sex marriage in the United States has been given special legal protection. This protection has historically been granted only to the unique institution of marriage as the cradle for the family and to legitimize lines of inheritance.&lt;!-- Dead Link&lt;ref&gt;[http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=CASE&amp;court=US&amp;vol=114&amp;page=15]&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt; Proponents of FMA argue that same-sex marriage advocates want to disregard [[federalism]] and use the judicial system to make same-sex marriage legal nationwide, which only the Federal Marriage Amendment can forestall.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

===Nationwide polling===

Polling on the subject has fluctuated widely, with opposition for such an amendment increasing steadily for more than a decade.  Beginning in 2010 polls have found majority support for legal recognition of [[same-sex marriage in the United States|same-sex marriage]]. A [[Gallup (company)|Gallup]] poll conducted in May 2014 found that 55% of Americans support allowing marriage for same-sex couples, the largest percentage ever measured by the organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Same-Sex Marriage Support Reaches New High at 55%|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/169640/sex-marriage-support-reaches-new-high.aspx|publisher=Gallup Polling|accessdate=May 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same poll found only 42% opposed, and 4% had no opinion on the issue.

A 2012 Fox News poll found that 38% of American voters support a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage, while 53% oppose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fox News poll: Majority opposes gay marriage, doesn't want constitutional amendment|url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2012/05/16/fox-news-poll-majority-oppose-gay-marriage-dont-want-constitutional-amendment/|accessdate=August 3, 2013|newspaper=CNN|date=May 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2012 United Technologies/National Journal Congressional Connection poll found that only 24% of Americans agreed that Congress should "pass a constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage in every state regardless of state law."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Public Opposes Gay Weddings at Military Facilities|url=http://www.nationaljournal.com/daily/public-opposes-gay-weddings-at-military-facilities-20120521|accessdate=August 3, 2013|newspaper=National Journal|date=May 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2011 AP-NCC poll found that 48% of Americans said they would favor such an amendment defining marriage as between a man and a woman, with about 40% strongly favoring such a change.  However, 55% believe the issue should be handled at the state level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=AP-NCC Poll: Narrow majority supports legal recognition of gay marriage, as issue roils states|url=http://ap-gfkpoll.com/featured/ap-ncc-poll-narrow-majority-supports-legal-recognition-of-gay-marriage-as-issue-roils-states|accessdate=August 3, 2013|newspaper=ap-gfkpoll|date=September 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2006 APR poll found that 33% of Americans favored amending the U.S. Constitution to ban same-sex marriage, while 49% felt each state should make its own laws on marriage, and 18% were unsure. In May 2006, a Gallup poll found that 50% of Americans would favor amending the federal Constitution to ban same-sex marriage, while 47% were opposed, and 3% were undecided or did not respond.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=FEDERAL MARRIAGE AMENDMENTS (FMA) TO THE U.S. CONSTITUTION|url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/maramend14.htm#|accessdate=August 3, 2013|newspaper=religioustolerance}}&lt;/ref&gt; An ABC News poll that year found that 42% of Americans supported amending the U.S. Constitution, banning same-sex marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Most Oppose Gay Marriage; Fewer Back an Amendment|url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/Politics/story?id=2041689&amp;page=1|accessdate=August 3, 2013|newspaper=CNN|date=June 5, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===State polling===
{{refimprove section|date=October 2014}}
{{Main|Public opinion of same-sex marriage in the United States#Demographic differences}}

Public opinion varies widely between different states. Only 2 states, [[Mississippi]] and [[Alabama]], had public opinion generally more opposed to same sex marriage than in favour in 2017, with only Alabama having an absolute majority, 51%, opposed; in Mississippi, there was plurality opposition.&lt;ref&gt;http://ava.prri.org/#lgbt/2017/States/lgbt_ssm/2,3,9&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Louisiana]], [[Tennessee]], [[North Carolina]], and [[West Virginia]], there was plurality support; in all other states, there was absolute majority support. The lowest approval of same sex marriage was 41% in Alabama. The highest was 80% in [[Vermont]] and [[Massachusetts]]. With 48 states more in favour of same sex marriage than opposed, and 44 with absolute majorities in favour, this amendment is very unlikely to ever pass.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="769">The '''good-faith provisions''', enacted in the [[2002 farm bill]] (P.L. 107–171, Sec. 1613), allow the USDA to forgive a participant from the loss of commodity and conservation program benefits when it is determined that the participant either tried but failed to fully comply with program requirements, or relied on faulty (incorrect) advice from the [[USDA]]. This provision applies to conservation and commodity programs, but not to credit or crop insurance programs.

[[File:HAJJ BOUND PEOPLE AT LUCKNOW.jpg|thumb|300px|Indian Muslims in Lucknow on their way to Saudi Arabia, covered by Hajj subsidy (air tickets)]]
The '''Haj subsidy''' was a subsidy that was given to [[Islam in India|Indian Muslim]] [[Hajj]] pilgrims by the Government of India in form of discounted Air fares on Indian Government owned Air India.  The program has its origins in British colonial era.&lt;ref name=uphaj/&gt; In post-colonial era, the Government of India expanded the program in 1959 with the Hajj Act.&lt;ref name=ha1959&gt;[http://indiankanoon.org/doc/102428/ The Haj Committee Act, 1959] Government of India&lt;/ref&gt; The subsidy initially applied to Indian Muslim pilgrims traveling for religious reasons to Saudi Arabia, Syria, Iraq, Iran and Jordan. Haj subsidy started in 1954, as an idea initiated by the then government, with flights between Mumbai and Jeddah. Additional flight legs were added over the years, and since 1984, all Haj traffic has been shared by Air India and Saudia, the national carriers of India and Saudi Arabia. The monopoly of these airlines has proven the most contentious point of the subsidy with some Muslims objecting to it by claiming that the real beneficiary is Air India as the subsidy is actually a discount on an overpriced air fare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://kafila.org/2011/02/28/the-myth-of-indias-hajj-subsidy-muhammad-farooq/|title=The myth of India’s Hajj subsidy: Muhammad Farooq|last=Vij|first=Shivam|date=2011-02-28|website=Kafila|access-date=2016-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There have also been requests by Muslims to withdraw subsidy including some Muslim Parliament members as it is against Islam even it was beneficial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zeenews.india.com/news/delhi/muslim-mps-demand-withdrawal-of-subsidy-on-haj-travel_691824.html|title=Muslim MPs demand withdrawal of subsidy on Haj travel|date=2011-03-07|access-date=2016-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2000, over 1.5 million Muslims have used the subsidy; since 2008, over 120,000 Indian Muslim every year make use of the subsidy.&lt;ref name="govtofindia2011"/&gt; The Hajj subsidy includes an airfare subsidy as well as assistance to Muslim pilgrims for domestic travel to reach specially designed Haj departure airport terminals, meal, medical care and lodging assistance&lt;ref name=moeahaj/&gt; provided by the Government of India.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mea.gov.in/Images/pdf/India-foreign-relation-2011.pdf Annual Report] Ministry of External Affairs, India&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icf.indianrailways.gov.in/works/uploads/files/icffiles/PB/pbhome/announce/haj2014a.pdf Haj Assistant Travel Advertisement] Ministry of Railways, Government of India, January 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The average airfare subsidy was about {{INRConvert|73526}} per Muslim pilgrim in 2008; while the average non-airfare financial assistance was {{INRConvert|2697}} per pilgrim.&lt;ref name="govtofindia2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name=moeahaj&gt;Ministry of External Affairs, Government of India, [http://164.100.47.132/LssNew/psearch/QResult15.aspx?qref=104040 LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION 300 ANSWERED ON 16.03.2011], See ANNEXURES-I&lt;/ref&gt; The total subsidy provided by the Government of India was US$1,815 per Muslim pilgrim in 2008. In a Central Haj Committee meeting in November 2017, it was decided that Haj subsidy will be completely phased out in 2018 and  funds will be utilised on educational programmes especially for girl children of the minority community.On 16th January 2018 Union minister for minority affairs said that the Hajj subsidy has been completely taken off (Rs 700crore) and this amount will be made used for educational purposes of the children belonging to minority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/haj-subsidy-to-be-phased-out-next-year/article19977130.ece|title=Haj subsidy to be phased out next year}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/women-over-45-years-no-longer-need-mehram-to-go-on-haj/story-rDkzkUI2KFHN0VZSyLnIzH.html|title=Women over 45 years no longer need mehram to go on Haj}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2012, the [[Supreme Court of India]] bench, composed of [[Altamas Kabir]] and [[Ranjana Desai]], ordered the government to end the practice by 2022.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livemint.com/Politics/trXuDTfMqI7qMUip3wNd7H/SC-strikes-down-Haj-subsidy.html|title=SC STRIKES DOWN HAJ SUBSIDY}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="voa120510"/&gt; "We direct the Central government to progressively reduce the amount of subsidy so as to completely eliminate it within a period of 10 years from today," said a bench of Justices Aftab Alam and Ranjana P Desai.&lt;ref name="m.timesofindia.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m.timesofindia.com/india/Abolish-haj-subsidy-in-10-years-Supreme-Court-to-government/articleshow/13059420.cms |title=Abolish haj subsidy in 10 years: Supreme Court to government - The Times of India |publisher=M.timesofindia.com |date=2012-05-09 |accessdate=2016-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
"The subsidy money may be more profitably used for uplift of the community in education and other indices of social development," said Justice Alam, who wrote the order. The court said it has no authority to speak on the minority community's behalf and that it would be presumptuous to tell the Muslims what was a good or bad religious practice even though it cited Quran to say that haj pilgrimage was mandatory only for those who could afford the expenses for traveling, food and accommodation.&lt;ref name="m.timesofindia.com"/&gt;

==History==

===Pre-1947 British Raj era===
The Haj subsidy traces its origins to the British colonial era. In 1932, the British colonial government enacted The Port Haj Committees Act, which provided for government funded Haj Committee and named Bombay and Calcutta as two embarkation points for Haj by Muslims in British India.&lt;ref name=uphaj/&gt; Along with Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act of 1937, the Haj Committees Act was one of a series of laws passed by the British colonial government to address Muslim demands in a riot torn, pre-partition South Asia.&lt;ref name=uphaj&gt;[http://uphajcommittee.com/history.htm History of Haj Announcement India] Government of Uttar Pradesh, India&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Duncan and Derrett (1968), Religion, Law and the State in India, Free Press, New York&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act, 1937; Universal Law Publishing, New Delhi; pp 3-7&lt;/ref&gt; The colonial government also granted a monopoly for sea-based Haj pilgrimage by South Asian Muslims to Mogul Line ships, owned by the British company Turner Morrison &amp; Co. Ltd.

===Post-colonial era===
In 1959, Indian government repealed and replaced the 1932 Act, enacting ''Haj Committee Act'', to establish a Committee in the Port of Bombay for assisting Muslim pilgrims to Saudi Arabia, Syria, Iraq, Iran and Jordan and for matters connected therewith. The purpose of this Act was to manage all affairs of pilgrims like disseminating information, to negotiate travel arrangements, arranging guides, helping the needy and to address grievances of pilgrims. &lt;ref name=ha1959/&gt; Article 16 of the 1959 law also created a taxpayer financed Haj Fund to cover overhead expenses.&lt;ref name=ha1959/&gt;

===From sea travel to air travel===
The Haj subsidy was modified in 1973, when the Indian government abolished sea travel as a means of making the Hajj for two reasons - rising oil prices after formation of OPEC and a ship accident that killed 39 pilgrims in June 1973 during the government managed Haj trip.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theshipslist.com/ships/lines/mogul.shtml Mogul Line History] Ship List&lt;/ref&gt; The government of India replaced the means of travel to Saudi Arabia from ships to aircraft. The government simultaneously increased the subsidy to cover the difference between sea and air fares.&lt;ref name="voa120510"/&gt;

Since 1994 the round trip cost to [[Jeddah]], Saudi Arabia has been fixed at {{INRConvert|12000}} per pilgrim, and the government has footed the rest of the bill. In 2007 the government spent {{INRConvert| 47454}} per passenger.&lt;ref&gt;Shauvik Ghosh, [http://www.financialexpress.com/printer/news/360651/ "Haj subsidy has Air India fuming"], ''The Financial Express'', 13 September 2008.

Ministry of Civil Aviation provides subsidy for air travel to the pilgrims through the Haj Committee of India. The amount on air travel charged per pilgrim during Haj 2014 was Rs. 35,000/- whereas the actual air fare ranged from Rs. 63,750 to Rs. 1,63,350 depending on the embarkation point in India which were always higher than normal charges of air tickets. For Haj-2015, an amount of Rs. 42,000/- will be charged as airfare from each pilgrim performing Haj through HCOI.
The subsidy amount extended was Rs.836.56 crores in 2012 to Rs. 680.03 crores in 2013. In 2014, it has further reduced to Rs. 533 crores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://factly.in/hajj-pilgrimage-subsidy-india/|title=How much Subsidy does the Government extend to Haj Pilgrims?|date=12 August 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the [[Supreme Court of India]] ordered that Haj subsidy must end by 2022.&lt;ref name=scoi2012&gt;[http://supremecourtofindia.nic.in/outtoday/39296.pdf SPECIAL LEAVE PETITION (CIVIL) NO.28609 OF 2011] Supreme Court of India&lt;/ref&gt; The Supreme Court found that Hajj by Indian Muslims is funded to a substantial extent by the Indian Government. The Court ruled that this subsidy is not only unconstitutional but inconsistent with the teachings of Quran. The Court cited Quran verse 97 in Surah 3, Al-e-Imran ordains as under: "In it are manifest signs (for example), the Maqam (place) of Ibrahim (Abraham); whosoever enters it, he attains security. And Hajj (pilgrimage to Makkah) to the House (Ka’bah) is a duty that mankind owes to Allah, those who can afford the expenses (for one’s conveyance, provision and residence); and whoever disbelieves [i.e. denies Hajj (pilgrimage to Makkah), then he is a disbeliever of Allah], then Allah stands not in need of any of the Alamin (mankind, jinn and all that exists)."&lt;ref name=scoi2012/&gt;

The Court directed the Central Government to progressively reduce the amount of Haj subsidy and abolish it by 2022. The Court, in its 2012 order, said the Centre should invest that amount in education and other development measures for the minority community.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;http://www.newindianexpress.com/thesundaystandard/Centre-Mulls-Ending-All-Pilgrimage-Subsidies/2015/01/18/article2623888.ece&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; also directed the Indian government to stop providing Hajj subsidies to Muslims identified by central government as ''very important person'' (VIP), ''very very important person'' (VVIP), and the special ''dignitaries and eminent persons'' nominations of 3,000 Muslims per year under so-called Goodwill Delegation to Saudi Arabia.&lt;ref name=scoi2012/&gt;

In August 2010, the Minority Affairs Ministry formally opposed providing subsidy for Haj pilgrimage, saying the scheme, was contrary to the teachings of Islam. The Government of India has proposed that starting from 2011, the amount of government subsidy per person will be decreased, and by 2017 will be ended completely. (Instead, "a premium would be charged from better-off Hajis to cross-subsidise the travel cost for the less well-off Hajis".)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ranjan|first=Amitav|title=Haj subsidy cuts start soon|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/haj-subsidy-cuts-start-soon/696844/|accessdate=14 July 2011|newspaper=The India Express|date=13 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Centre had informed the Supreme Court that it had decided to restrict Haj pilgrimage at government subsidy to Muslims only as a "once in a lifetime" affair as against the existing policy of "once in five years".  In an affidavit filed before the apex court, the government said the new guidelines have been framed to ensure that priority is given to those applicants who have never performed Haj.  The apex court was hearing an appeal filed by the Centre challenging a Bombay high court judgement which had directed the Ministry of External Affairs to allow certain private operators to operate the services of 800 of the 11,000 pilgrims earmarked under the VIP quota subsidised by the government.  Earlier, the bench had pulled up the Centre's practice of "politicising" the annual Haj pilgrimage by permitting official delegations to accompany the pilgrims, for which the government offers huge subsidy, saying, "It's a bad religious practice."

On 27 July 2012, the Supreme Court declined Centre's request to defer till next year its 23 July order down sizing the government's discretionary quota to 300 from the proposed 5,050 seats and had hoped these would be allotted on "reasonable basis".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-07-27/india/32888401_1_haj-policy-haj-pilgrims-haj-committee|title= SC says no to Centre's plea to relax Haj pilgrims quota order
| date= 27 July 2012 | work=The Times Of India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Phase-out===

The subsidy had been reduced from Rs. 685 crore in 2011 to Rs 200 crore by 2017.&lt;ref&gt;http://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/haj-subsidy-haj-india-modi-mukhtar-abbas-naqvi-5027434/&lt;/ref&gt; It was stopped by the government from 2018 onwards and will be used instead for education of Muslim girls. Union minister [[Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi]] confirmed it had been withdrawn.&lt;ref&gt;https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/government-ends-subsidy-for-haj-pilgrims/articleshow/62523061.cms&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Considerable criticism has been levelled against this practice, both by Hindu organisations opposed to state funding of private pilgrimage outside India and by Muslim pressure groups. As an example of the latter, Mohib Ahmad contends that even [[Air India]]'s subsidised fare is higher than competing airlines' ordinary fare.&lt;ref&gt;Mohib Ahmad,  [http://indianmuslims.in/haj-subsidy-anyone/ "Haj Subsidy, Anyone?"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090225144807/http://indianmuslims.in/haj-subsidy-anyone/ |date=25 February 2009 }}, ''Indian Muslims'' blog, 18 January 2006. Retrieved 25 June 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the government has continued offering the Haj subsidy despite protests from the Muslim community at large. Syed Shahabuddin claims that Air India's rising costs for travel, and the consequent increases in the Government of India's subsidy, have resulted partly from differences in [[exchange rate|foreign exchange rate]]s beyond the airline's control. He suggests charter fares should be set at two-thirds of regular [[IATA]] fares, but points out that the Haj has higher costs than other charters because two empty flights are required to return the aircraft to India and to position the aircraft in Arabia for the pilgrims' return journey.&lt;ref name=syed&gt;Syed Shahabuddin, [http://www.milligazette.com/Archives/15092002/1509200242.htm "Haj subsidy is a fact and must go eventually"], ''The Milli Gazette'', 15 September 2002. Retrieved 26 June 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Shahabuddin maintains that the subsidy ought to be phased out because Hindus view the subsidy as preferential treatment of India's Muslim minority.&lt;ref name=syed /&gt; [[Zafarul Islam Khan]] states that,''"Muslims in general are not in favour of the Hajj subsidy.  We consider the subsidy as a subsidy to Air India and not to the Muslim community."''&lt;ref name="voa120510"/&gt;

Syed Ahmed Bukhari, the Shahi Imam of Delhi's Jama Masjid mosque, said a decade was far too long for the subsidy to be phased out. "It should be done away with within a year," he told reporters.
Salman Khurshid, minister for minority affairs and a member of the Congress party, which heads the coalition government, expressed no surprise about the court's decision, telling reporters that discussions to "roll back the Haj subsidy" had been under way for four years. 
Asaduddin Owaisi, a member of parliament from the city of Hyderabad said, this amount of subsidy is to simply being a subsidy for Air India. Ticket prices would be far lower, he said yesterday, if Air India's monopoly were broken and pilgrims simply bought their own, unsubsidised tickets on other airlines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m.thenational.ae/news/world/south-asia/muslim-support-for-end-of-subsidies-for-indias-haj-pilgrims|title=Muslim support for end of subsidies for India's Haj pilgrims - The National|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other Muslim leaders have argued that the Hajj subsidy is "un-Islamic" and that Hajj money should be invested in education and health instead. Maulana [[Mahmood A. Madani]], a member of the [[Rajya Sabha]] and general secretary of the [[Jamiat-e-Ulema-e-Hind]], declared that the Hajj subsidy is a technical violation of Islamic [[Sharia]], since the [[Koran]] declares that Hajj should be performed by Muslims using their own resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/haj-subsidy-unislamic-use-that-money-on-our-education-health/16740/ |title='Haj subsidy unIslamic, use that money on our education, health' |work=The Indian Express |date=17 November 2006 |accessdate=2012-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Influential Muslim lobbies in India have regularly insisted that the Hajj subsidy should be phased out as it is UnIslamic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/News-Feed/newdelhi/Muslim-leaders-back-cutting-Haj-subsidy/Article1-529806.aspx |title=Muslim leaders back cutting Haj subsidy |work=Hindustan Times |date=11 April 2010 |accessdate=2012-05-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120121122532/http://www.hindustantimes.com/News-Feed/newdelhi/Muslim-leaders-back-cutting-Haj-subsidy/Article1-529806.aspx |archivedate=21 January 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Praveen Togadia]] of [[Vishwa Hindu Parishad]] has argued that the government sponsored Haj subsidy is provided from taxes of Hindus to pay for Muslim religious pilgrimages, and demanded that it be abolished or similar grants be extended to Hindus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/why-cant-hindus-get-subsidies-like-muslims-asks-praveen-togadia/articleshow/57841116.cms|title=Why can't Hindus get subsidies like Muslims, asks Praveen Togadia|publisher=Economic Times |date=26 March 2017 |accessdate=2017-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2661">In medieval Europe, within the [[Holy Roman Empire]], a '''Hofmeister''' (literally "court-master" or "house-master" in [[German language|German]]; {{lang-la|Magister, Praefectus curiae}}; {{lang-da|hofmester, hovmester}}, {{lang-sv|hovmästare}}, {{lang-cs|hofmistr}}, {{lang-pl|ochmistrz}}; {{lang-fr|précepteur}}; {{lang-it|precettore / istitutore}}) was an official who acted as an aide to royalty or to a senior nobleman or cleric. Later it became a term for a schoolmaster who looked after the welfare of students in addition to their education.

== Roles ==
=== In the service of royalty and other magnates ===
A ''Hofmeister'' was one of the highest offices in the courts of German emperors and kings, and also existed in other princely [[court]]s and the courts of smaller dynasties. His official role was initially in the direction of the royal household and serving privately on the monarch's person.
In the 15th century it became a government office and in the German princely courts finally became equivalent to a privy counsellor or cabinet minister, and sometimes as something like the [[Master of the Household]] in the modern British royal court.

=== In the service of prelates ===
A ''Hofmeister'' was also the title given to someone who acted as an ''adlatus'' or aide to his abbot in a [[monastery]]. 

=== In service of education ===
Later a ''Hofmeister'' could also be a [[Tutor#Private tutors|house-tutor]], also responsible for the care of his students beyond their education. Even now, in some areas, an administrator for a greater good is known as a ''hofmeister'' when he would otherwise be called a ''house-tutor''.

== Theatre ==
It gave its name to ''[[The Tutor|Der Hofmeister]]'', a play by [[Jakob Michael Reinhold Lenz]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1803">In the [[Russian Empire]], '''inorodtsy''' (singular: '''inorodets''', Literally meaning "of different descent/nation") was an ethnicity-based category of population. Informally, the term referred to non-Russian ([[Triune Russian people|in the broad sense]]) population of the empire. In strict legal sense it referred for certain indigenous ethnicities of non-European descent specifically listed in the corresponding code of law. 

The term is sometimes translated as '''allogeneous (people)''' (cf. "[[allogenes]]") and sometimes as "aliens". The latter translation is misleading, since in most cases the term was applied to the [[demographics of Siberia|indigenous population of Siberia]], [[Central Asia]], and [[Russian Far East]]. 

Initially, a legal statute was introduced for special treatment of certain peoples of Russia (including a certain degree of protection of their traditional life), for which some laws of the empire were deemed inappropriate. Over time the term acquired a [[pejorative]] connotation of "lacking culture, uncivilized peoples". Privileges and special treatment for ''inorodtsy'' included exemption of [[military service]], protection of [[grazing land]]s, and religious and governmental self-administration.&lt;ref&gt;James R. Millar (ed.) (2004) ''Encyclopedia of Russian History'', MacMillan Reference,  {{ISBN|0-02-865693-8}} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John W. Slocum, "Who, and When, Were the ''Inorodtsy''?

'''International finance''' (also referred to as '''international monetary economics''' or '''international macroeconomics''') is the branch of [[financial economics]] broadly concerned with [[monetary economics|monetary]] and [[macroeconomics|macroeconomic]] interrelations between two or more countries.&lt;ref name="Gandolfo 2002"&gt;{{Cite book | title = International Finance and Open-Economy Macroeconomics | author = Gandolfo, Giancarlo | year = 2002 | publisher = Springer | location = Berlin, Germany | isbn = 978-3-540-43459-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pilbeam 2006"&gt;{{Cite book | title = International Finance, 3rd Edition | author = Pilbeam, Keith | year = 2006 | publisher = Palgrave Macmillan | location = New York, NY | isbn = 978-1-4039-4837-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; International finance examines the dynamics of the [[global financial system]], [[international monetary systems]], [[balance of payments]], [[exchange rates]], [[foreign direct investment]], and how these topics relate to [[international trade]].&lt;ref name="Gandolfo 2002" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Pilbeam 2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Feenstra &amp; Taylor 2008"&gt;{{Cite book | title = International Macroeconomics | author = Feenstra, Robert C. | author2 = Taylor, Alan M. | year = 2008 | publisher = Worth Publishers | location = New York, NY | isbn = 978-1-4292-0691-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes referred to as multinational finance, international finance is additionally concerned with matters of international [[corporate finance|financial management]]. Investors and [[multinational corporation]]s must assess and manage international risks such as [[political risk]] and [[foreign exchange risk]], including transaction exposure, economic exposure, and translation exposure.&lt;ref name="Madura 2007"&gt;{{Cite book | title = International Financial Management: Abridged 8th Edition | author = Madura, Jeff | year = 2007 | publisher = Thomson South-Western | location = Mason, OH | isbn = 0-324-36563-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Eun &amp; Resnick 2011"&gt;{{Cite book | title = International Financial Management, 6th Edition | author = Eun, Cheol S. | author2 = Resnick, Bruce G. | year = 2011 | publisher = McGraw-Hill/Irwin | location = New York, NY | isbn = 978-0-07-803465-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some examples of key concepts within international finance are the [[Mundell–Fleming model]], the [[optimum currency area]] theory, [[purchasing power parity]], [[interest rate parity]], and the [[international Fisher effect]]. Whereas the study of international trade makes use of mostly [[microeconomics|microeconomic]] concepts, international finance research investigates predominantly [[macroeconomics|macroeconomic]] concepts.

The three major components setting international finance apart from its purely domestic counterpart are as follows:
# [[International trade|Foreign exchange]] and political risks.
# [[Market imperfection]]s.
# Expanded [[opportunity set]]s.

These major dimensions of international finance largely stem from the fact that sovereign nations have the right and power to issue currencies, formulate their own economic policies, impose taxes, and regulate movement of people, goods, and capital across their borders.&lt;ref name="Eun &amp; Resnick 2015"&gt;{{Cite book | title = International Financial Management, 7th Edition | author = Eun, Cheol S. | author2 = Resnick, Bruce G. | year = 2015 | publisher = McGraw-Hill/Irwin | location = New York, NY | isbn = 978-0-07-786160-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kirovsk''' ({{lang-uk|Кіровськ}}, {{lang-ru|Kировск}}) is a city in [[Luhansk Oblast]] ([[oblast|province]]) of [[Ukraine]]. It is incorporated as a [[city of regional significance (Ukraine)|city of oblast significance]]. Population: {{Ua-pop-est2013|28,529}}.

==History==
The populated place was founded in 1764 as a village '''Golubovka''' by the Russian colonel and a native of Serbia Peter Golub. Its history follows closely the history of industrial development in the Eastern Ukraine. 

The town grew when coal mines were set up in the area and the village was known as a settlement Golubovskiy Rudnik; reaching its peak size in the 1980s. When the area was recaptured from Nazi Germany in 1944, the settlement was renamed as '''Kirovsk''' after the Russian mayor of Leningrad. In 1962 the settlement was granted the city rights. 

The landscape around the town still has pyramid-shaped manmade hills, they are the by-products of the coal mine development and make the area look somewhat surreal. The best time to visit Kirovsk is August; a few national and local holiday celebrations take place during this month, such as the Independence Day and the Coal Miner Day. During the holidays the nightlife is booming; there are live concerts performed by regional, sometimes national, artists on the town stadium with many festivities in the town park. The town's population would grows noticeably during the holidays when many friends and families come to visit.

Popular outdoor activities are hunting in the prairies surrounding Kirovsk and fishing on the nearby lakes. Local terrain is very hilly and has many roads and paths that makes it perfect for mountain biking. The area has a few historic sites that include beautiful churches, a museum and a World War II memorial. Town swimming pool is popular among locals and has a gym. Most popular nightlife destinations are the small cafes and the discothèque in the town park that are open only during the summer.

Since 2014, Kirovsk has been located on the territory of the [[Luhansk People's Republic]] and is not controlled by Ukrainian authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gkslg.info/files/chisl_0915.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160204211939/http://gkslg.info/files/chisl_0915.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=4 February 2016|title=Численность населения по состоянию на 1  октября  2015 года по  Луганской Народной Республ ике|publisher=[[Luhansk People's Republic]]|language=Russian|accessdate=21 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city was renamed to '''Holubivka''' by Ukrainian authorities, however, the Luhansk People's Republic does not recognize this name.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5527">In [[economics]], the '''local knowledge problem''' is the observation that the data required for rational economic planning are distributed among individual actors, and thus unavoidably exist outside the knowledge of a central authority.

== Hayek's description ==
{{quotefarm|section|date=February 2013}}
[[Friedrich Hayek]] described this distributed local knowledge:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Today it is almost heresy to suggest that scientific knowledge is not the sum of all knowledge. But a little reflection will show that there is beyond question a body of very important but unorganized knowledge which cannot possibly be called scientific in the sense of knowledge of general rules: the knowledge of the particular circumstances of time and place. It is with respect to this that practically every individual has some advantage over all others because he possesses unique information of which beneficial use might be made, but of which use can be made only if the decisions depending on it are left to him or are made with his active coöperation. We need to remember only how much we have to learn in any occupation after we have completed our theoretical training, how big a part of our working life we spend learning particular jobs, and how valuable an asset in all walks of life is knowledge of people, of local conditions, and of special circumstances. To know of and put to use a machine not fully employed, or somebody's skill which could be better utilized, or to be aware of a surplus stock which can be drawn upon during an interruption of supplies, is socially quite as useful as the knowledge of better alternative techniques. And the shipper who earns his living from using otherwise empty or half-filled journeys of tramp-steamers, or the estate agent whose whole knowledge is almost exclusively one of temporary opportunities, or the arbitrageur who gains from local differences of commodity prices, are all performing eminently useful functions based on special knowledge of circumstances of the fleeting moment not known to others.&lt;ref name="AER519-30"&gt;Friedrich A. Hayek, "[[The Use of Knowledge in Society|The Use of Knowledge]]", ''American Economic Review''. XXXV, No. 4. pp. 519-30 (1945).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Because this distributed knowledge, while incomplete, is essential to economic planning, its necessity is cited as evidence in support of the argument that economic planning must be performed in a similarly distributed fashion by individual actors.  In other words, economic planning by a central actor (e.g. a government bureaucracy or a central bank) necessarily lacks this information because, as Hayek observed, statistical aggregates cannot accurately account for the universe of local knowledge:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
One reason why economists are increasingly apt to forget about the constant small changes which make up the whole economic picture is probably their growing preoccupation with statistical aggregates, which show a very much greater stability than the movements of the detail. The comparative stability of the aggregates cannot, however, be accounted for—as the statisticians occasionally seem to be inclined to do—by the "law of large numbers" or the mutual compensation of random changes. The number of elements with which we have to deal is not large enough for such accidental forces to produce stability. The continuous flow of goods and services is maintained by constant deliberate adjustments, by new dispositions made every day in the light of circumstances not known the day before, by B stepping in at once when A fails to deliver. Even the large and highly mechanized plant keeps going largely because of an environment upon which it can draw for all sorts of unexpected needs; tiles for its roof, stationery for its forms, and all the thousand and one kinds of equipment in which it cannot be self-contained and which the plans for the operation of the plant require to be readily available in the market.&lt;ref name="AER519-30"/&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
As such, the local knowledge problem is a microeconomic counterargument to macroeconomic arguments that favor central planning and regulation of economic activity.

The Wikipedia library itself represents a tool which [[Jeffrey Tucker|Jeffrey A. Tucker]] considers the "realization of Hayek's solution to the localized knowledge problem".  In economic terms, Wikipedia is a platform that created a market of knowledge.  In this platform reliable information is gathered from individual, distributed agents; local knowledge becomes public knowledge.  Wikipedia founder [[Jimmy Wales]] explains this further: "the old way of gathering reliable information was to gather it from the outside in, and then the expert sorted through what is valuable and became the distribution source. The new way gives opportunities for anyone who knows anything to contribute to building." &lt;ref name="FEE"&gt;Jeffrey Tucker. [https://fee.org/articles/wikipedia-is-the-wonder-of-the-world-that-wasn-t-supposed-to-work/ "Wikipedia Is the Wonder of the World that Wasn’t Supposed to Work"], ''[[Foundation for Economic Education]]'', March 10, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:London Psychogeographical Association.jpg|thumb|200px|logo of the East London Section of the London Psychogeographical Association]]

The '''London Psychogeographical Association''' ('''LPA'''), sometimes referred to as the ''London Psychogeographical Committee'', is an organisation&lt;ref&gt;'[http://www.unpopular.demon.co.uk/lpa/elpan001/001weareback.html We're Back]', ''LPA Newsletter'', No.1 Imbolc 1993 p1&lt;/ref&gt; devoted to [[psychogeography]]. The LPA is perhaps best understood in the context of [[psychogeographical]] [[Praxis (process)|praxis]].

==London Psychogeographical Institute==
The LPA was first mentioned in 1957 by the British artist [[Ralph Rumney]], as one of the organisers of the "First Exhibition of Psychogeography" in Brussels, which included his work.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cddc.vt.edu/sionline/chronology/1957.html Situationist International Online]&lt;/ref&gt; According to many accounts the group (which was also referred to as the London Psychogeographical Institute, Society or Committee) eventually merged into the [[Situationist International]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Smith|first=Jeremy|title=The situationist city|url=http://www.sfbg.com/lit/aug02/sit.html|work=The Guardian Literary Supplement|accessdate=7 November 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040319114543/http://www.sfbg.com/lit/aug02/sit.html|archivedate=19 March 2004|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rumney was in fact the only member of the 'Association'.

==LPA East London Section==
In the 1990s, the LPA was reinvoked as the LPA East London Section by [[Fabian Tompsett]], using the pseudonym Richard Essex, who published a series of newsletters and pamphlets under its name, as well as the writers grouped around the multiple user name [[Luther Blissett (nom de plume)|Luther Blissett]], including [[Stewart Home]]. Activities of the ELS also included trips to destinations of psychogeographical interest and the organisation of [[three sided football]] matches.

This version of the LPA has been described by the writer [[Iain Sinclair]], whose work is often described as [[psychogeography|psychogeographical]], as useful in "branding" that kind of practice.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.forteantimes.com/articles/147_iainsinclair.shtml Fortean Times Magazine | Articles |]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060504215741/http://www.forteantimes.com/articles/147_iainsinclair.shtml |date=May 4, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spoiledink.com/FEATURES/author_interviews_007.php Edit Red Writing Community]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060508072216/http://www.spoiledink.com/FEATURES/author_interviews_007.php |date=May 8, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994 Barry Hugill wrote an article for ''[[The Observer]]'' covering the LPA. He depicted their ideas as "so cranky that to mention [[Peter Ackroyd|Mr Ackroyd]]'s name in the same breath is to invite a writ." However he also states that "the psychogeographers fear that in 2000 there may be an attempt to perpetuate [[patriarchy]] through the [[ritual murder]] of a top member of royalty." &lt;ref&gt;'Cultists' Go Round in Circles', Barry Hugill, ''The Observer'' Sunday 28 August 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

The work of Luther Blissett, Stewart Home and other psychogeographical groups is said to involve the issuing of numerous leaflets and letters under a series of aliases, both personal and organisational, and the description of interactions, including collaborations and feuds, between both these and other, real people and groups (for example between Luther Blissett and the parapolitical researcher [[Larry O'Hara]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stewarthomesociety.org/feud.htm Stewart Home: Feuds]&lt;/ref&gt;

The last LPA Newsletter was issued around the year 2000.

'''Manuel António de Sousa''' (10 November 1835 in [[Mapuçá]], [[Goa]], [[Portuguese India]] &amp;ndash; 20 January 1892 in [[Portuguese Mozambique]]), also known as Gouveia, was a [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] [[merchant]] of [[Goan]] origin and military captain of [[Manica, Mozambique|Manica]] and [[Quiteve]] ([[Kiteve]]).'''&lt;ref name="boletim"&gt;''Boletim Geral do Ultramar. XXXVII - 427 e 428''. Lisboa, 1961. pp. 445-447&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Manuel António de Sousa was born in [[Mapuçá]], [[Bardez]] municipality ([[Goa]]) in 1835. He was the son of Félix de Sousa, [[landlord]] and proprietor, and D. Doroteia Tomásia Mascarenhas. He studied at the [[Rachol Seminary]] in [[Salcete]], [[Goa]], until he reached the age of 16.{{cn|date=July 2015}}

==Migration to Africa==

In 1853 he emigrated to [[Zambézia]], to assist in the administration of the estate of his uncle Félix Mascarenhas. On his arrival in Portuguese Mozambique, he married his cousin, Maria Anastácia Mascarenhas, the only daughter of his uncle.{{cn|date=July 2015}} He became established as a businessman in the [[Vila de Sena|Sena]] region. Speedily, he made a fortune in the [[ivory trade]] and gained power in the region. Armed elephant hunters formed the core of his personal militia. 

He won a reputation for his loyalty both to the governor-general and the [[Kingdom of Portugal]], and relentlessly fought the chiefs and indigenous kings to expand his personal empire.&lt;ref name="gali"&gt;Galli, Rosemary. ''Peoples' spaces and state spaces: land and governance in Mozambique''. Lanham: Lexington Books, 2003. pp. 54-55. {{ISBN|0739106325}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1856 he took part in the war of succession of the local kingdom of [[Gaza Empire|Gaza]] and settled in the mountains of [[Gorongosa]], where he established the basis of an [[aringas]] system which, together with his private army, was used to defend his interests.&lt;ref name="gali"/&gt;

==Help in battles==

Several times Gouveia's forces helped the Portuguese official forces their battles, particularly in campaigns against the Bonga.&lt;ref name="rasmussen"&gt;Rasmussen, R. Kent e Lipschultz, Mark. R. ''Dictionary of African historical biography''. Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1989. pp. 223. {{ISBN|0520066111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1863, on account of the services rendered, he succeeded [[Isidoro Correia Pereira]] as the chief captain of [[Manica, Mozambique|Manica]] and Quiteve ([[Kiteve]]).&lt;ref name="gali"/&gt;

During his absence from [[Vila de Sena|Sena]], to receive the commission, his position in [[Gorongosa]] was taken by [[Umzila]], the winner of the [[Gazaland]] throne winner, and only at a cost could he recover the territories.&lt;ref name="rasmussen"/&gt;

==Lord of Manica==

Around 1874 he was recognized as the Lord of [[Manica, Mozambique|Manica]], and married the daughter of the [[Báruè District|Báruè]] [[king]]. Their son was later recognized as king of that region.&lt;ref name="rasmussen"/&gt;

Manuel António de Sousa became a close friend of artillery captain [[Joaquim Carlos Paiva de Andrada]], one of the mentors of the [[Companhia de Moçambique]]. A raid in support of the [[Mutassa]] chief, on land disputed by [[Cecil Rhodes]]'s [[British South African Company]], led to them being taken prisoner by the police of that company, which resulted in a diplomatic conflict between the Portuguese and [[British Empire]]s. They were eventually released following the intervention of the [[Portuguese government]].&lt;ref name="newit"&gt;Newitt, Malin. ''A history of Mozambique''. London: C. Hurst &amp; Co. Publishers, 1995. pp. 288-9. {{ISBN|185065171X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his arrest a rumour surfaced that he had been killed, and this led to an agitation among the Báruè population. Gouveia died in combat while trying to regain control of Báruè.&lt;ref name="rasmussen"/&gt;&lt;ref name="newit"/&gt;

==Role in history==

Malyn Newitt&lt;ref name="Newitt"&gt;''A History of Mozambique'', 1995: C. Hurst &amp; Co, p.288-289 &lt;/ref&gt; describes Manuel António de Sousa as "a new name ...  beginning to be heard in the 1850s" who was to become "in some ways the greatest of the ''muzungo''&lt;ref&gt;Non-African, generally Portuguese but could refer to Asians&lt;/ref&gt; warlords, but he did not belong to a traditional [[Zambesi]]an family and cannot strictly be called [[Afro-Portuguese]]. In Portuguese parlance he was a ''Canarin'', an [[India]]n from [[Goa]]." &lt;ref name="Newitt" /&gt;(p 288) Newitt writes that Sousa "made a fortune in ivory trading and his armed elephant hunters formed the nucleus of a private army which he repeatedly made available to the Portuguese authorities during the [[Zambesi]] wars." (p 288)&lt;ref name="Newitt" /&gt; He is said to have built up the reputation of working with the government and being a loyal subject of Portugal while "ruthlessly building up his own private empire on the fringes of the Portuguese colony." (p 289)&lt;ref name="Newitt" /&gt;

Souza took advantage of the death of [[Gaza Empire|Gazaland]] king [[Soshangane]] in 1856, and the subsequent succession dispute, to establish himself in the interior in [[Gorongosa]]. Around 1875, says Newitt,&lt;ref name="Newitt" /&gt; "Souza (sic) had by that time become as important a figure as the Gaza king in the politics of the area."

== Tributes ==
On 28 November 1960 a statue of Manuel António de Sousa sculpted by {{ILL|Martins Correia|pt}} was inaugurated in the north [[Goa]] town of [[Mapuçá]], in commemoration of the 125th anniversary of his birth.&lt;ref name="boletim"/&gt; This statue was destroyed on 15 December 1961 by a bombing just prior to the military action that led to the integration of [[Goa]] into the [[Indian Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mail-archive.com/goanet@goanet.org/msg07284.html|title=RE: [Goanet]RE: Manuel Antonio de Sousa|author=A.

The '''Ministry of Education, Universities and Research''' (in {{lang-it|'''Ministero dell'Istruzione, dell'Università e della Ricerca'''|italic=no}} or '''MIUR''') is the ministry of the [[Council of Ministers (Italy)|Italian government]] for the national education system, the Italian universities and research agencies.  The current [[Italian Minister of Education]] is [[Marco Bussetti]].

==History==
In 1988, the Ministero dell'Università e della Ricerca was split off from the [[Ministry of Public Education (Italy)|Ministry of Public Education]].  In the first [[Romano Prodi]] cabinet the two were merged back into the Ministero della Pubblica Istruzione, Università, Ricerca Scientifica e Tecnologica, then as the Ministero dell'istruzione, dell'università e della ricerca (MIUR) in the second and third [[Silvio Berlusconi]] cabinets.  The two were re-separated in the second Prodi cabinet of 17 May 2006, but then re-merged in the fourth Berlusconi cabinet of 7 May 2008.

==Structure==

===National level===
*Department for ministerial planning and for ministerial management of the education budget, human resources and information 
*Department for education 
*Department for the universities, higher education establishments in art, music and dance,

The three Departments carry out policies dictated by the Ministry and form the body which directs and programs educational policy.

===Local level===
Regional education "uffici", which are autonomous administrative centres, carrying out the instructions of the Departments, directly supporting individual schools, and articulating the policies on the ground.

==Ministers==

===Since 2001===

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6138">'''Model Arab League''', also known as '''MAL''', is a multi-regional model competition in which high school and university students from across the world learn about and compete as representatives from Member States of the [[Arab League]].  Participants are encouraged to use the experience to hone their skills in public speaking and diplomacy, in addition to the primary goal of learning about the politics and history of the Arab world.  In the [[United States]], the competitions are administered by [[The National Council on U.S.-Arab Relations]] [http://www.ncusar.org/ (NCUSAR)].  Outside the United States, the [http://www.uop.gr University of Peloponnese] hosts the [http://www.corinthmal.org Corinth Model Arab League] and the [[American University in Cairo]] hosts the [http://www.modelarableague.org/ Cairo International Model Arab League (CIMAL)]. In the UK, the longest running Model Arab League Conference in Europe [http://uobmal.co.uk/ UoBMAL] [previously named EuroMAL] has been run by the University of Birmingham UN Society [a UNA Youth UK Branch]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=UNA-UK|title=UNA Youth Birmingham|url=http://una.org.uk/members/branches/una-youth-birmingham|publisher=UNA-UK|accessdate=29 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; since 2004.

== Councils and Topics ==

Model Arab League conferences are divided into councils that each focus on a specific area of Arab League policy.  While the councils at CIMAL and other international MAL simulations tend to fluctuate, the central organization of the NCUSAR in the United States assures that most simulations within the US share common councils from year to year.

The NCUSAR-sponsored council list consists of eight councils, though not all of the councils are simulated at all models.&lt;ref name="agenda"&gt;[http://www.ncusar.org/modelarableague/agenda.html Mal | Agenda&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

*Joint Defense Council (JDC)
**The Joint Defense Council primarily deals with matters of [[collective security]] within the Arab League.  The JDC operates under the guidelines of the ''Treaty of Joint Defense and Economic Cooperation Between the States of the Arab League, June 17, 1950''&lt;ref name="jdtreaty"&gt;[http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/mideast/arabjoin.htm The Avalon Project : Treaty of Joint Defense and Economic Cooperation Between the States of the Arab League, June 17, 1950&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Council on Palestinian Affairs
**The Council on Palestinian Affairs is charged with evaluating and responding to the plethora of issues involving the Palestinian people and their interaction with their neighbors.  As Palestine is a fully recognized Member State of the Arab League,&lt;ref name="palestine_status"&gt;[[Arab League#Status of Palestine]]&lt;/ref&gt; the representative from Palestine has considerable influence in this council.
*Council of Arab Social Affairs Ministers
**This council deals primarily with social matters relating to the Arab world, such as human rights, refugees, etc.
*Council on Political Affairs
**The Council on Political Affairs focuses on matters related to political interactions between Member States of the Arab League and between the Arab League or certain Member States and states outside of the Arab League.
*Council of Arab Environmental Affairs Ministers
**This council is concerned with environmental conditions within and related to Member States of the Arab League.  Issues such as water rights, agricultural chemicals, and long-term environmental sustainability are often discussed in this council.
*Council of Arab Economics Affairs Ministers
**The Council of Arab Economics Affairs Ministers focuses its efforts on ensuring the economic success of the Arab world.  This council has historically focused on topics such as long-term economic stability, diversification away from primarily oil-based economies, and ensuring adequate employment opportunities for persons living in the Arab world.
*Special Summit of Arab Heads of State
**The Special Summit was available in certain regional competitions, as well as the national competition in Washington, D.C., for the 2008 competition. This simulation is unique from the others in that instead of simply role-playing a diplomat from a Member State, individuals working in this Special Summit are actually asked to role-play a [[Head of state]] of a specific Arab League Member State.  This leads to a unique experience for everyone involved in the Special Summit as they are the final authority on all policy matters for their respective state, and therefore must be careful of their announced decisions and negotiations in this body as they may impact all of the delegates from the same Member State assigned to the other councils.
*Special Summit of Arab Ministers of Justice
**This Special Summit will replace the Special Summit of Arab Heads of State in certain regional competitions and the national competition in Washington, D.C., for the 2009 competition. This simulation would be more accurately called "Special Summit of Arab Ministers of Social Justice;" delegates representing member nations are asked to debate policies as diverse as human rights, freedom of information, intellectual property rights, the International Criminal Court, etc.
*Arab Court of Justice (ACJ)
**The Arab Court of Justice is an idealized body that does not actually have a counterpart in the Arab League.  The ACJ is simulated at Model Arab League conferences in order to demonstrate the potential effectiveness of such an entity to the Arab League.  The ACJ typically deals with controversial matters within the Arab world and attempts to provide solutions for these problems.  Court cases have historically ranged from refugee and employment disputes to questions of resource allocation and territorial disputes, particularly with regard to [[Western Sahara]].  Much of how the ACJ functions is modeled after the [[International Court of Justice]].

The '''Monument to the Victims of the Soviet Occupation''' ({{lang-ro|Monument în memoria victimelor ocupaţiei sovietice}}) is a proposed [[monument]] in [[Chişinău]], [[Moldova]].

A commemorative stone was unveiled on 28 June 2010, as a monument to the victims of the [[Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina|Soviet occupation]] and the totalitarian communist regime, [[Soviet Occupation Day, Moldova|Soviet Occupation Day]] in Moldova.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.ura-inform.com/politics/2010/06/24/moldov?nocache# June 28 Moldova would seek the withdrawal of Russian occupiers] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717173114/http://en.ura-inform.com/politics/2010/06/24/moldov?nocache |date=2011-07-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is located on [[National Assembly Square, Chișinău|Great National Assembly Square]], formerly known as Victory Square and once home to the central monument to [[Lenin]] of [[Soviet Moldavia]].

{{Use dmy dates|date=May 2013}}
'''Morten Kjærum''' (born 30 March 1957) is a Danish lawyer, who is the new head of the [[Raoul Wallenberg Institute of Human Rights and Humanitarian Law]] in Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;http://rwi.lu.se/morten-kjaerum-named-new-director/&lt;/ref&gt; He is also a former director of the [[Danish Institute for Human Rights]] and of the [[EU Agency for Fundamental Rights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2009-03-31-homophobia-europe_N.htm|title=Gays, lesbians face harassment in Europe|date=31 March 2009|work=[[USA Today]]|accessdate=31 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life ==
Kjærum obtained his degree in law from [[Aarhus University]] in 1984. He was the Head of the Danish Refugee Asylum Department from 1984–1991, and in 1991 he became director of the Danish "Centre for Human Rights". When the Centre closed in 2002, Kjærum became director of the newly established Institute for Human Rights at the Danish Centre for International Studies and Human Rights, where he worked until May 2008.

In March 2008 he was appointed director of the Vienna-based EU Agency for Fundamental Rights (FRA), taking up the post in June that year.&lt;ref&gt;http://fra.europa.eu/en/about-fra/structure/director&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2013, the FRA Management Board extended his contract as Director of the Agency for another 3 years, with effect from 1 June 2013.&lt;ref&gt;http://fra.europa.eu/en/press-release/2013/fra-directors-contract-extended-another-3-years&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of March 2015, Kjærum left the FRA to become head of the Raoul Wallenberg Institute in Lund, Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jyllands-posten.dk/navne/ECE6752304/dansk-ildsjael-far-nyt-internationalt-job/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-06-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141029073115/http://jyllands-posten.dk/navne/ECE6752304/dansk-ildsjael-far-nyt-internationalt-job/ |archivedate=29 October 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002 he became a member of the UN [[Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination]] (CERD) and in 2004 Chairman of the [[International Coordinating Committee of National Human Rights Institutions]] (ICC).

In August 2008, Kjærum received a prize from the Danish National Association for Gays and Lesbians for promoting the rights of gays and lesbians.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lgbt.dk/2473/&lt;/ref&gt;

Founded in 1990 by [[Ken Saro-Wiwa]], Ogoni Chiefs of MOSOP initiated efforts with the [http://www.ogoniyouthnetwork.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Ogoni-Bill-of-Rights.pdf Ogoni Bill of Rights].&lt;ref name="Ogoni Bill of Rights"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ogoniyouthnetwork.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Ogoni-Bill-of-Rights.pdf| title= Ogoni Bill of Rights|website=ogoniyouthnetwork.org|publisher=Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People |accessdate=December 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saro-Wiwa led its submission to the government of the [[Federal Republic of Nigeria]] and the [[United Nations Working Group on Indigenous Peoples]] in Geneva.

==Background==
{{expand section|date=December 2014}}

The Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People began as a struggle against the [[exploitation of natural resources]] of [[Ogoniland]] by [[Shell Oil Company]], a subsidiary of [[Royal Dutch Shell]], when in 1957 its Nigerian operations, [[Shell Nigeria]], known as Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria Limited (SPDC), struck oil in the [[Niger River Delta]].

=== Environmental Impact on the Niger River Delta Region ===

Communities of the Niger River Delta which had sustained their economy on farming and fishing, saw the takeover of their land by multinational oil companies was causing devastating [[environmental degradation]]. Saro-Wiwa called it an 'ecological war'.&lt;ref name="Trial Speech of Ken Saro-Wiwa"&gt;{{cite wikisource |url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Trial_Speech_of_Ken_Saro-Wiwa |title=Trial Speech of Ken Saro-Wiwa |date=November 10, 1995 |accessdate=19 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The Ogoni country has been completely destroyed by the search for oil.... Oil blowouts, spillages, oil slicks, and general pollution accompany the search for oil.... Oil companies have flared gas in Nigeria for the past thirty three years causing acid rain.... What used to be the bread basket of the delta has now become totally infertile. All one sees and feels around is death. Environmental degradation has been a lethal weapon in the war against the indigenous Ogoni people.&lt;ref name="Pipe Dreams"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://english.wisc.edu/rdnixon/files/pipe_dreams.pdf |title=Pipe Dreams: Ken Saro-Wiwa, Environmental Justice, and Micro-Minority Rights |last=Nixon |first=Rob |website=english.widc.edu |date=January 1996 |publisher=University of Wisconsin-Madison |accessdate=December 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

—Ken Saro-Wiwa, Interview on Channel 4 (U.K.) on November 15, 1995
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Bronwen Manby, then researcher in the Africa Division of Human Rights Watch, documented in July 1997 that "according to the official estimates of the [[Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation]] (NNPC), based on the quantities reported by the operating companies, approximately 2,300 cubic meters of oil are spilled in 300 separate incidents annually. It can be safely assumed that, due to under-reporting, the real figure is substantially higher: conservative estimates place it at up to ten times higher. Statistics from the [http://dpr.gov.ng Department of Petroleum Resources] indicate that between 1976 and 1996 a total of 4,835 incidents resulted in the spillage of at least 2,446,322 barrels (102.7 million U.S. gallons), of which an estimated 1,896,930 barrels (79.7 million U.S. gallons; 77 percent) were lost to the environment. Another calculation, based on oil industry sources, estimates that more than 1.07 million barrels (45 million U.S. gallons) of oil were spilled in Nigeria from 1960 to 1997. Nigeria's largest spill was an offshore well [[blowout (well drilling)]] in January 1980, when at least 200,000 barrels of oil (8.4 million U.S. gallons), according to oil industry sources, spewed into the Atlantic Ocean from a Texaco facility and destroyed 340 hectares of mangroves. DPR estimates were that more than 400,000 barrels (16.8 million U.S. gallons) were spilled in this incident."&lt;ref name="HRW Reports"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.hrw.org/reports/1999/nigeria/Nigew991-05.htm#P526_156650 |title=The Price of Oil |last=Manby |first=Bronwen |date=January 1999 |publisher=Human Rights Watch |accessdate=December 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Ogoni has suffered and continues to suffer the degrading effects of oil exploration and exploitation: lands, streams and creeks are totally and continually polluted; the atmosphere is for ever charged with hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide; many villages experience the infernal quaking of the wrath of gas flares which have been burning 24 hours a day for 33 years; acid rain, oil spillages and blowouts are common. The result of such unchecked environmental pollution and degradation are that (i) The Ogoni can no longer farm successfully. Once the food basket of the eastern Niger Delta, the Ogoni now buy food (when they can't afford it); (ii) Fish, once a common source of protein, is now rare. Owing to the constant and continual pollution of our streams and creeks, fish can only be caught in deeper and offshore waters for which the Ogoni are not equipped. (iii) All wildlife is dead. (iv) The ecology is changing fast. The mangrove tree, the aerial roots of which normally provide a natural and welcome habitat for many a sea food – crabs, periwinkles, mudskippers, cockles, mussels, shrimps and all – is now being gradually replaced by unknown and otherwise useless plants. (v) The health hazards generated by an atmosphere charged with hydrocarbon vapour, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide are innumerable.&lt;ref name="Ogoni Bill of Rights" /&gt;

—Dr. G. B. Leton, President of MOSOP, addendum statement in the Ogoni Bill of Rights&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Mangrove]] forest is particularly vulnerable to oil spills, because the soil soaks up the oil like a sponge and re-releases it every rainy season.&lt;ref name="HRW Reports" /&gt;

Water contamination of local water supply resulted in fish kills and ruinous effects on farmland.&lt;ref name="HRW Reports"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.hrw.org/legacy/reports/1995/Nigeria.htm |title=Nigeria, The Ogoni Crisis, Vol. 7, No. 5 |date=July 1995 |publisher=Human Rights Watch |accessdate=December 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Human Rights Watch]] interview with Uche Onyeagocha, staff attorney, Civil Liberties Organisation (Port Harcourt), Washington, D.C., May 12, 1995, documented that members of minority groups in the Niger Delta, whose land is the source of over 90% of Nigeria's oil, especially opposed the prevailing revenue allocation formula, under which the federal, state, and local governments had almost complete discretion over the distribution of oil proceeds.&lt;ref name="HRW Reports"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.hrw.org/legacy/reports/1995/Nigeria.htm#P181_20149 |title=Nigeria: The Ogoni Crises |date=July 1995 |publisher=Human Rights Watch |accessdate=December 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 80% of Nigeria's federal government revenue comes from this resource rich region.&lt;ref name="Nigerian Economy"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nigerianembassy.nu/economy/ |title=Nigerian Economy |publisher=Embassy of Nigeria, Stockholm Sweden |accessdate=December 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The World Bank estimates this accrues to only 1% of the general population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://priceofoil.org/content/uploads/2011/01/DrillingIntoDebt.pdf|last1=Kretzmann|first1=Stephen|last2=Noouruddin|first2=Irfan|title=Drilling into Debt - An Investigation into the Relationship Between Debt and Oil|website=priceforoil.org|publisher=Oil Change International|accessdate=December 22, 2014|ref=Drilling Into Debt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ogoni people will make representation to the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund to the effect that giving loans and credit to the Nigerian Government on the understanding that oil money will be used to repay such loans is to encourage the Nigerian government to continue to dehumanise the Ogoni people and to devastate the environment and ecology of the Ogoni and other delta minorities among whom oil is found.
The Ogoni people will inform the United Nations and the Organisation of African Unity that the Nigerian Constitution and the actions of the power elite in Nigeria flagrantly violate the UN Declaration of Human Rights and the African Charter of Human and Peoples Rights; and that Nigeria in 1992 is no different from Apartheid South Africa. The Ogoni people will ask that Nigeria be duly chastised by both organizations for its inhuman actions and uncivilized behaviour. And if Nigeria persists in its perversity, then it should be expelled from both organizations.&lt;ref name="Ogoni Bill of Rights" /&gt;

Former World Bank Vice-President for Africa, Dr. Oby Ezekwesili, gave an estimation of $400 billion of Nigeria's oil revenue that was stolen or misspent from 1960 to 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Soniyi |first1=Tobi| title=Nigeria: U.S.$400 Billion of Oil Revenue Stolen, Says Ezekwesili |url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201208290453.html |publisher=allafrica.com |accessdate=December 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around 70% of the oil revenues were estimated by a Nigerian anti-corruption agency to have been wasted or lost to corruption. The [[Nuhu Ribadu]] led Task Force on Oil Revenue, produced a 146-page study covering 2002–2011. The report validated that "Nigeria lost out on tens of billions of dollars in oil and gas revenues over that decade from cut price deals struck between multinational oil companies and government officials cut-price gas, while Nigerian oil ministers handed out licenses at their own discretion. The report alleges international oil traders sometimes buy crude without any formal contracts, and the state oil firm had short-changed the Nigerian treasury billions over the last 10 years by selling crude oil and gas to itself below market rates." The Ribadu report also noted in a ten-year span: "The estimated cumulative of the deficit between value obtainable on the international market and what is currently being obtained from NLNG, over the 10 year period, amounts to approximately $29 billion."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://reuters.com/article/2012/10/24/us-nigeria-oil-idUSBRE89N0VV20121024 |title=Exclusive: Nigeria loses billions in cut price oil deals - report |publisher=Reuters |date=October 24, 2012|accessdate=December 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shell Oil's [[Greenwashing]] efforts prompted [[Friends of the Earth]] Europe, on May 8, 2007, to file simultaneous complaints in three European countries to the national advertising standards authorities of Belgium, the Netherlands, and the UK about Shell's advertisements that depicted the outline of an oil refinery emitting flowers rather than smoke and claimed that it uses its "waste CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to grow flowers and [its] waste sulphur to make concrete".&lt;ref name="Shell's Misleading Ad: Complaint Submitted"&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://foeeurope.org/press/2007/May8_PDC_Shell_advert.htm |title= Shell's misleading ad: complaint submitted: Oil refineries emit smoke not flowers |date=May 8, 2007 |publisher=Friends of the Earth Europe |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071020013905/http://www.foeeurope.org/press/2007/May8_PDC_Shell_advert.htm |archivedate=October 20, 2007 |accessdate=December 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shell Oil has maintained that the issues of pollution of the Niger Delta is brought about by illegal refining of crude oil, sabotage and theft of oil field infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Shell in Nigeria - The UNEP Report|url=http://s02.static-shell.com/content/dam/shell-new/local/country/nga/downloads/pdf/2014bnotes/unep.pdf|website=shell.com|publisher=SpDC, SNEP and Shell Nigeria Gas|accessdate=December 22, 2014|date=April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research by Amnesty International, CEHRD and Friends of the Earth provide examples of cases where Shell claimed the cause of a spill was sabotage, but this claim was subsequently called into question by other investigations or the courts. This evidence, which includes video footage of an oil spill investigation where the cause of the spill was changed, by Shell, from "equipment failure" to "sabotage, following the field investigation, has been shared with Shell.&lt;ref name="No Progress"&gt;{{cite web|title=No Progress|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/afr44/013/2014/en/ |publisher=Amnesty International |accessdate=December 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under Nigerian law the operating company is responsible for cleaning up oil spills from its facilities, even if the spill is the result of third-party action. Therefore, the human and environmental impact of Shell's failure to properly clean up pollution cannot be defended by reference to illegal activity that, allegedly, caused the oil spills.&lt;ref name="No Progress" /&gt;

Because of the oil-related suffering of the Ogoni people, governmental neglect, lack of social services, and political marginalization, these concerns were placed in the context of Ogonis as "a separate and distinct ethnic nationality". On this basis they sought [[Autonomous entity|autonomy]], environmental protection, control of a fair share of the revenues from their resources, and cultural rights (such as the use of their local languages).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Social problems in Africa: new visions |last=Rwomire |first=Apollo |year=2001 |publisher=[[Greenwood Publishing Group]] |isbn=978-0-275-96343-9 |pages=83–85 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{expand section|date=December 2014}}

In 1970, Ogoni Chiefs and Elders of the Ogoni Divisional Commission ( W. Nzidee, F. Yowika, N. Ndegwe, E. Kobani, O. Nalelo, Chief A. Ngei and O. Ngofa), [http://www.hartford-hwp.com/archives/34a/022.html submitted a petition]&lt;ref name="Shell in Ogoni"&gt;{{cite web|last1=|first1=|author1=Ken Saro-Wiwa|title=Shell in Ogoni 1992 (Excerpt)|url=http://www.hartford-hwp.com/archives/34a/022.html|website=|accessdate=December 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the local Military Governor as a formal complaint against Shell, then operating a joint venture with BP. It brought notice that the company was "seriously threatening the well-being, and even the very lives" of the Ogoni.

Shell's response was that the petition was an attempt to place development and other responsibilities on the company and that the "contentions ... bear little relation to what is actually taking place".&lt;ref name="Shell in Ogoni" /&gt;

In July, there was a major blow-out at the Bomu oilfield in Ogoni, which continued for three weeks, causing widespread pollution and outrage. P. Badom, of the Dere Youths Association, issued a letter of protest citing:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Our rivers, rivulets and creeks are all covered with crude oil" wrote the Dere Youths Association, "We no longer breathe the natural oxygen, rather we inhale lethal and ghastly gases. Our water can no longer be drunk unless one wants to test the effect of crude oil on the body. We no longer use vegetables, they are all polluted."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Badom|first1=P.|title=A Protest Presented to Representatives of the Shell-BP Dev.Co of Nig.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Iko people wrote to Shell in 1980 demanding "compensation and restitution of our rights to clean air, water and a viable environment where we can source for our means of livelihood".&lt;ref name="All for Shell" /&gt;

In 1987, when the Iko once again held a peaceful demonstration against Shell, the notorious [[Nigerian Mobile Police|Mobile Police Force (MPF)]], locally known as "kill-and-go" was called, and 40 houses were destroyed, with 350 people made homeless by the MPF's attack.&lt;ref name="All for Shell" /&gt;

In August 1990, the Ogoni elders signed the Ogoni Bill of Rights, which rang for "political control of Ogoni affairs by Ogoni people, control and use of Ogoni economic resources for Ogoni development, adequate and direct representation as of right for Ogoni people in all Nigerian national institutions, and the right to protect the Ogoni environment and ecology from further degradation".&lt;ref name="All for Shell" /&gt;

MOSOP was the outgrowth of these protest demonstrations in the Delta. Goodluck Diigbo, a journalist, was the National President of the National Youth Council of Ogoni People, NYCOP. Saro-Wiwa had charged him with the responsibility of establishing seven of the ten affiliates that made up MOSOP. Before the affiliates came into being, Ken Saro-Wiwa who initiated the idea of MOSOP had attracted a mix of educated Ogoni elites and chiefs, including its first president Dr. Garrick Barile Leton .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Legitimizing human rights NGOs: lessons from Nigeria |last=Okafor |first=Obiora Chinedu |year=2006 |publisher=Africa World Press |isbn=978-1-59221-286-6 |pages=39–41 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Chief E. N. Kobani became vice president of MOSOP.

MOSOP succeeded in organizing its first efforts with the 1990 Ogoni Bill of Rights addressed to the Government of the Federal Republic and the People of Nigeria, General [[Ibrahim Babangida]], the former military president of Nigeria and members of the [[Armed Forces Ruling Council (Nigeria)|Armed Forces Ruling Council]], but received no reply to its demands for autonomy. The Ogoni lists their concerns: political autonomy to participate in the affairs of the Republic as a distinct and separate unit (by whatever name called), provided that this autonomy guarantees political control of Ogoni affairs by Ogoni people; the right to control and use a fair proportion of Ogoni economic resources for Ogoni development; adequate representations, as of right, in all Nigerian national institutions, and the right to protect the Ogoni environment and ecology from further degradation.&lt;ref name="Ogoni Bill of Rights"/&gt;

The Niger Delta was brought to international attention with the protest at Shell's facility in the Umuechem community of [[Etche]], east of [[Port Harcourt]], [[Rivers State]] on October 30 and 31, 1990. Shell specifically requested the presence of the MPF.&lt;ref name="All for Shell" /&gt; This incident saw approximately 80 unarmed demonstrators killed and the destruction and severe damage of 495 houses by the [[Nigerian Mobile Police]].&lt;ref name="HRW Reports"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.hrw.org/reports/1999/nigeria/Nigew991-08.htm#P989_341696 |title=The Price of Oil |last=Manby |first=Bronwen |date=January 1999 |publisher=Human Rights Watch |accessdate=December 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Early 1990s and The Ogoni Crises ===

'''1992'''
* July 1992 – Saro-Wiwa addresses the United Nations Working Group on Indigenous Peoples in Geneva.&lt;ref name="All for Shell" /&gt;
* Early December 1992 – The conflict escalated to a level of greater seriousness and intensity on both sides. It was in this phase of the conflict that overt violence was applied on the large scale by the Nigerian government. In December 1992, MOSOP sent its demands to SPDC, Chevron, and the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, along with an ultimatum to pay back royalties and compensation within thirty days or quit Ogoniland.&lt;ref name="HRW Reports"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.hrw.org/legacy/reports/1995/Nigeria.htm |title=Nigeria, The Ogoni Crisis, Vol.7, No.5 |date=July 1995 |publisher=Human Rights Watch |accessdate=December 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The collision course between the two parties was set with an ultimatum to the oil companies ([[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]], [[Chevron Corporation|Chevron]], and the [[Nigerian National Petroleum Company]]), which demanded some $10 billion in accumulated [[royalties]], damages and compensation, and "immediate stoppage of environmental degradation", and negotiations for mutual agreement on all future drilling. If the companies failed to comply, the Ogonis threatened to embark on mass action to disrupt their operations. By this act, the Ogonis shifted the focus of their actions from an unresponsive federal government to oil companies actively engaged in their own region. The bases for this assignment of responsibility were the vast profits accrued by the oil companies from extracting the natural wealth of the Ogoni homeland, none of which were trickling down to the Ogoni.&lt;ref name="Niger Delta Affairs"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nigerdeltaaffairs.org/index.php/ogoni-bill-of-rights |title=Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People |website=nigerdeltaaffairs.org |accessdate=December 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1993'''
* January 4 – The national government responded by banning public gatherings and declaring that disturbances of oil production were acts of treason. In spite of the ban, MOSOP went ahead with a massive public mobilization on January 4, 1993. The event, called the first Ogoni Day, attracted about 300,000 people in massive festivities. Over the next month as the mobilization continued, one Shell employee (out of thousands) was beaten by an Ogoni mob. As a security measure, [[Shell Petroleum Development Company]] withdrew its employees from Ogoniland. This action had very mixed consequences. Oil extraction from the territory has slowed to a trickle of {{convert|10000|oilbbl/d|m3/d}} (.5% of the national total). However, because the withdrawal was a temporary security measure, it provided the government with a compelling reason to "restore order": resume the flows of oil from Ogoniland and of oil money to national coffers.&lt;ref name="Niger Delta Affairs"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nigerdeltaaffairs.org/index.php/ogoni-bill-of-rights |title=Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People |website=nigerdeltaaffairs.org |accessdate=December 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* February 15–16, 18 – Shell International advisors meet with the Shell Petroleum Development Company (SPDC) in London and the Hague to consider strategies for countering the "possibility that internationally organized protest could develop" over Shell's activities in Ogoni.
* April 18 – Ken Saro-Wiwa, chairman of the resistance group "Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People (MOSOP)", is held by the Nigerian State Security Service at Port Harcourt Airport for 16 hours without charges, is released, but then arrested 5 days later.
* April 30 – Construction work on Shell's Rumuekpe-Bomu Pipeline destroys freshly planted Ogoni farmland sparking a peaceful demonstration of approximately 10,000 Ogoni villagers. Nigerian Federal government soldiers open fire on the crowd of demonstrators, wounding at least 10.
* May 1 – Mass demonstrations along Bori Road against the pipeline construction continue. Shell decides to withdraw American workers and equipment.
* May 3 – Agbarator Otu is shot and killed by members of the Nigerian military while protesting work on the pipeline at Nonwa.
* May 16 – Saro-Wiwa has his passport seized while trying to leave for London.
* May 18 – Amnesty International issues an Urgent Action concerning the extra judicial killing of Otu and the Nigerian government's use of force against peaceful Ogoni protests.
* May 24 – Saro-Wiwa begins a European tour and succeeds in drawing attention to the struggle of the Ogoni people. Shell responds to the international attention and is "happy to discuss these matters further...."
* June 12 – Presidential elections are boycotted by the Ogoni. A ruptured pipeline begins to spray oil in Bunu Tai, Ogoni land. Forty days later, the flow is yet to be stopped. Saro-Wiwa is prevented from traveling to the UN conference in Vienna by Nigerian SSS, and his passport is seized.
* June 21 – Saro-Wiwa and other MOSOP officials are arrested.
* June 22 – Ogoni people march in Bori, in protest against MOSOP arrests. In reaction, Federal government soldiers are moved from Port Harcourt and stationed in Bori. Indiscriminate beatings and arrests of Ogoni people by "heavy[ily] armed and unfriendly Nigerian soldiers and police" are frequent.
* June 30 – Amnesty International issues a Fast Action concerning Saro-Wiwa.
* July 9 – At least 60 Ogoni people are killed, allegedly by Andoni, when arriving back from the Cameroon Republic by boat. This "incident" marks the beginning of Ogoni-Andoni violence.
* Mid-July – Saro-Wiwa is moved to a hospital and later released on bail, but charges still stand.
* August 5 – Kaa is the first village attacked in the Andoni-Ogoni conflict, resulting in 33 deaths and 8,000 refugees. Over the coming months, similar incidents occur in over 20 other villages. MOSOP accuses Shell of being behind the Andoni-Ogoni violence.
* August 31 – MOSOP leaders are summoned to Abuja for a meeting with the Interim government, installed by former head of state Babangida after the annulment of the June 12 election results. This is the first time that the Nigerian government officially discussed the situation in Ogoniland with MOSOP.
* Beginning September – Saro-Wiwa, Senator Birabi, and representatives of the Rivers State Security Council visit the destroyed village of Kaa and urge Governor Ada George to take measures to curb Andoni-Ogoni violence. Meetings are arranged between Andoni and Ogoni leaders and government representatives. This leads to the creation of a Peace Committee, headed by Professor Claude Ake.
* September 15 – General Sani Abacha promises Saro-Wiwa that Federal troops will be sent to Ogoniland to help curb Andoni-Ogoni violence.
* October 6 – A Peace Agreement is signed concerning the Ogoni-Andoni troubles, but without the signature of Saro-Wiwa, or the "consultation of the communities involved".
* October 17 – An oil spill at Korokoro oil fields in Ogoni, operated by Shell. Baritonle Kpormon is shot dead at a checkpoint in Bori by a Federal soldier who has been sent to ensure peace at the Ogoni-Andoni border; however Bori is not at the border. A MOSOP Steering Committee meeting accepts the Peace Agreement but for two paragraphs, and calls for a Judicial Commission of Inquiry to be installed by the Federal government.
* October 19 – Professor Ake, chairman of the Peace Conference, send a letter to Governor Ada George, stating that he does not agree with the Peace Agreement. According to him, it was drafted in haste and without proper consultation of the communities involved.
* October 23 – Two fire trucks from SPDC are seized at Korokoro by local inhabitants.
* October 25 – Three Ogoni men are shot at Korokoro oil fields by Federal government soldiers accompanying Shell workers who went back to retrieve the fire trucks. One man dies (Uebari Nna), and two are wounded (Pal Sunday and Mboo Ndike).
* November 17 – The interim government resigns. General Abacha becomes the new Nigerian head of state.
* December 13 – Governor Ada George is replaced by Lt. Col. Dauda Komo. Violent clashes between Ogoni and Okirika over crowded land at waterfronts, Port Harcourt. Over 90 people are reported dead, many more wounded.
* December 28 – Probably to prevent the start of the Ogoni Week, MOSOP leaders Dr. Owen Wiwa and Ledum Mitee, a lawyer, are arrested without being charged. The Ogoni Assembly is dispersed by Nigerian soldiers. Lt. Col. Komo states that Ogoni Week was aborted because MOSOP did not apply for a permit.

'''1994'''
* January 2 – Saro-Wiwa is placed under house arrest.
* January 4 – Owen Wiwa and Ledum are released and Saro-Wiwa's house arrest is lifted.
* January 11 – A seven-member Commission of Inquiry is installed by the Rivers State government to investigate Ogoni-Okirika clashes, and starts public sittings in Port Harcourt.
* January 20 – A three-member ministerial team starts a two-day tour of Rivers State to investigate the hostilities between the communities there, as part of a general inquiry of community clashes. The Nigerian government is especially worried about troubles in oil producing areas.
* January 21 – A $500 million contract is signed in Port Harcourt between Shell Nigeria and ABB Global Engineering UK, allowing the latter to collect gas from 10 flow stations in Rivers State.
* January 24 – The three major oil companies in Port Harcourt estimate to have lost over $200 million during 1993, due to "unfavorable conditions in their areas of operation", and call for urgent measures to combat the situation.
* April – A memo was sent from Komo to Okuntimo, entitled "Restoration of Law and Order in Ogoniland" It gave details for an extensive military presence in Ogoni, drawing resources from the army, air force, navy, and police, including both the Mobile Police Force and conventional units. In a move meant to facilitate the reopening of oil installations, one of the missions of this operation was to ensure that those "carrying out business ventures ... within Ogoniland are not molested". Saro-Wiwa, commenting on the memo above, said: "This is it – they are going to arrest us all and execute us. All for Shell." The following month Okuntimo sent a "restricted" memo back to Komo remarking, "Shell operations still impossible unless ruthless military operations are undertaken for smooth economic activities to commence." To counter this, Okuntimo recommended: "Wasting operations during MOSOP and other gatherings making constant military presence justifiable."&lt;ref name="All for Shell" /&gt;
* Beginning April – A small conflict between Ogoni and Okoloma leads to serious clashes; Lt. Col. Komo is reported to have said that soldiers have been directed to deal with aggressive communities, and if necessary shoot trouble makers. Fifteen Ogoni people are arrested without being charged, including Dr. Wiwa.

On May 21, 1994, four Ogoni chiefs (all on the conservative side of a schism within MOSOP over strategy) were murdered. Saro-Wiwa, head of the opposing faction, had been denied entry to Ogoniland on the day of the murders, but was then detained in connection with the killings. Rivers State Military Administrator Lt. Col. [[Dauda Komo]] did not wait for a judicial investigation to blame the killings on "irresponsible and reckless thuggery of the MOSOP element".&lt;ref&gt;Videotape, press conference, Port Harcourt, Nigerian Television Authority, May 22, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

Led by Major [[Paul Okuntimo]] of [[Rivers State]] Internal Security, who claimed to be "searching for those directly responsible for the killings of the four Ogonis", witnesses say that they engaged in terror operations against the general Ogoni population. [[Amnesty International]] characterized the policy as deliberate terrorism. By mid-June, 30 villages had been completely destroyed, 600 people had been detained, and at least 40 had been killed. An eventual total of around 100,000 internal refugees and an estimated 2,000 civilian deaths was recorded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://allafrica.com/stories/200807250063.html |title=Nigeria: Deriving Benefits From Oil Revenue |last=Ayodele |first=Thompson |date=July 28, 2008 |website=allafrica.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ken Saro-Wiwa, N. G. Dube and Kobari Nwilewas were arrested in Port Harcourt in Rivers State in eastern Nigeria on June 21, 1993. Following their arrest, Ken Saro-Wiwa, N. G. Dube and Kobari Nwile were first transferred to Lagos, then to Owerri in Imo State and finally to Port Harcourt where they are currently in prison. The three were charged on 13 July 1993 under the Criminal Code of Eastern Nigeria in connection with their activities on behalf of the Ogoni community. Charges on six counts relating to unlawful assembly, seditious intention and seditious publication. Bail was not set and all three remanded in custody until September 20. On June 11, Saro-Wiwa's passport was confiscated at Lagos airport, preventing him from traveling to Vienna to represent MOSOP at the United Nations World Conference on Human Rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/library/info/AFR44/007/1993/en |work=Amensty International |title=UA 238/93 - Nigeria: health concern / legal concern: Ken Saro-Wiwa, N.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I repeat that we all stand before history. I and my colleagues are not the only ones on trial. Shell is here on trial and it is as well that it is represented by counsel said to be holding a watching brief. The Company has, indeed, ducked this particular trial, but its day will surely come and the lessons learnt here may prove useful to it for there is no doubt in my mind that the ecological war that the Company has waged in the Delta will be called to question sooner than later and the crimes of that war be duly punished. The crime of the Company's dirty wars against the Ogoni people will also be punished.

==== Saro-Wiwa vs. Shell ====

On November 10, 2014, MOSOP President Legborsi Saro Pyagbara, at the 19th anniversary commemoration of the "Ogoni Martyrs" held in Port Harcourt, Rivers State, called on the federal government to clear the late activist, Ken Saro-Wiwa, and the other nine Ogoni people executed by General Sani Abacha's government for murder. Pyagbara recalled that the UN, which monitored the trial of Saro-Wiwa and the Ogoni Nine, observed that the returned verdict did not follow any known local or international standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201411111319.html |title=Nigeria: Clear Ken Saro-Wiwa, Others of Murder, MOSOP Urges Govt |last=Chinwo |first=Ernest |date=November 11, 2014 |website=allafrica.com |accessdate=December 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Communist Parties}}
The '''New Communist Party of Britain''' is a [[communist]] [[political party]] in [[United Kingdom|Britain]]. The origins of the NCP lie in the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]] from which it split in 1977. The organisation takes an [[anti-revisionist]] stance on [[Marxist-Leninism]] and is opposed to [[Eurocommunism]]. Following the fall of the [[Soviet Union]], the party signed up to the [[Pyongyang Declaration]] in 1992. It publishes a newspaper named ''[[The New Worker]]''.

==Formation==
The driving force behind the formation of the New Communist Party in 1977 was [[Sid French]], who had been the CPGB's [[Surrey]] district secretary for many years.&lt;ref&gt;Eurocommunism: A New Kind of Communism? Annie Kriegal- Page 65&lt;/ref&gt; French was born into a [[class consciousness|class-conscious]] [[working class]] family in 1920 and joined the [[Young Communist League (Britain)|Young Communist League]] in 1934, at the age of 14. In 1941, during the [[Second World War]], he was called up and served in the [[Royal Air Force]]. Promoted to sergeant in 1942, French was posted to [[Gibraltar]] and later to [[North Africa]] and [[Italy]]. While on active service he wrote an article for ''[[Labour Monthly]]'' about the problems facing the [[Gibraltarian people|Gibraltarians]] [[Military history of Gibraltar during World War II|under war conditions]]. In [[Algiers]] he met Henri Alleg, a French Communist journalist, who later joined the Algerian resistance against French colonialism and spent five years in prison for his activities. After postwar [[demobilisation]] French's commitment to the Communist movement led to his appointment as Secretary of the newly formed Surrey District Committee of the CPGB in 1950.&lt;ref&gt;Reuben Falber

Sid French was a member of the [[General and Municipal Workers Union]] (G&amp;MWU) and an active co-operator. He was elected to the Political Purposes Committee of the [[Royal Arsenal Co-operative Society]] (RACS) in 1967&lt;ref&gt;Minute Books and Papers of the Royal Arsenal Co-operative Society, 1868-1994&lt;/ref&gt; and elected to the RACS Members' Council in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;''Sid French: Reminiscences'' -- NCPB, London 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Divisions within the CPGB==
Divisions within the CPGB had emerged following the Soviet intervention to quell the [[1956 Hungarian Revolution|Hungarian uprising in 1956]]&lt;ref&gt;MacDiarmid: Christopher Murray Grieve, a Critical Biography - by Alan Bold, Alan Norman Bold 1990 p409&lt;/ref&gt; and the subsequent moves by the [[Nikita Khrushchev]] leadership in the [[USSR]] to denounce [[Joseph Stalin]]. [[Sino-Soviet split|The split]] within the international communist movement that eventually polarised between the positions of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] and the [[Communist Party of China]] was not a major contributing factor and the groups that supported the Chinese position had little support within the CPGB. French remained staunchly loyal to the Soviet Union though privately he opposed the Khrushchev line. What he did have in common with those who eventually left to form their own organisations was a common belief that the CPGB's policy, known as the ''[[British Road to Socialism]]'' (BRS), was a major revision of [[Marxist-Leninist]] principles and was essentially a left [[social democratic]] and [[reformist]] programme.

In the eyes of French and like-minded observers, the CPGB leadership under John Gollan used the Hungarian crisis and the denunciation of what Khrushchev called Stalin's "[[cult of personality]]" to weaken and divide the party as a whole. The ''British Road to Socialism'', was first revised in 1957 - the start of a process culmination in 1977 which, for French, deprived it of all revolutionary content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/history/etol/newspape/isj/1977/no101/briefing.htm|title=Briefing: The Crisis in the British Communist Party (September 1977)|work=marxists.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1966, the ''Daily Worker'' was re-launched as ''[[Morning Star (British newspaper)|The Morning Star]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.morningstaronline.co.uk/about-us/|title=About Us|work=morningstaronline.co.uk|accessdate=October 29, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161030000307/http://www.morningstaronline.co.uk/about-us/|archive-date=2016-10-30|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; - French had been among those who had campaigned against this change. The CPGB leadership's decision to support the [[Alexander Dubček|Dubček]] leadership in [[Czechoslovakia]] and oppose the Soviet-led [[Warsaw Pact]] intervention in 1968 that led to Dubček's removal widened the divisions within the CPGB.&lt;ref&gt;East West Digest By Foreign Affairs Circle, Petersham, England 1972&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1964 [[Labour Party(UK)|Labour]] returned to power after 13 years of [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] rule but the new government under [[Harold Wilson]] pursued policies seen by many leftists as anti-union (including an attempt to introduce "[[In Place of Strife]]" compulsory arbitration), while in [[Northern Ireland]] the government was seen by many in the Catholic community as supporting its oppression following the collapse of the [[civil rights]] campaign. The Tories, under [[Edward Heath]], returned to power in 1970 with policies even more unpopular with the British left, contributing to the largest number of strikes involving the greatest number of workers in British history. [[UK miners' strike (1972)|Miners' strikes in 1972]] and [[UK miners' strike (1974)|1974]] featured widespread participation from the working class and other sectors. Heath was defeated in 1974 and in the eyes of many on the British left, the second Wilson government continued where it left off.

French and like-minded British communists saw the Wilson/[[James Callaghan|Callaghan]] government of 1974-79 as implementing "[[class collaboration]]ist" policies and felt this was becoming more obvious to the working class, but believed the CPGB was incapable of presenting a clear revolutionary perspective, and had no capacity to rally workers on a mass scale against the capitalist offensive. French and others believed that at a moment of profound crisis for social democracy, their party was impotent and unable to wage a struggle for communist policies.

It was during this period of struggle and change that the CPGB declined at an alarming rate. It became more isolated from the people than at any other time in its history. The decline in membership and ''Morning Star'' circulation accelerated. The Young Communist League collapsed, while the growing crisis in the party also affected the credibility of its leadership as formerly senior and influential members left its ranks. In 1976, four of the party's top engineering activists resigned: Bernard Panter, Cyril Morton, [[Jimmy Reid]] and John Tocher, who had all been members of the Political Committee. At the base of the party the crisis in organisation was even more clear. Thousands of members were no longer organised and many did not even pay their nominal 25p monthly dues.&lt;ref&gt;[[Yearbook on International Communist Affairs]] By Richard F. Staar, Milorad M. Drachkovitch, Hoover Institution&lt;/ref&gt;

Warring camps emerged within the party. Since the 1960s a secret faction known as the "Smith Group"&lt;ref&gt;Smith group CPGB Archive cat CP/ORG/MISC/6/8 1970&lt;/ref&gt; and later as the "Party Group" had operated within the CPGB based around the theories of the Italian communist leader [[Antonio Gramsci]]. This provided the political base for the emergence of an open [[Eurocommunist]] faction in the early 1970s. The Gollan leadership sought to prop itself up by aligning itself with the Eurocommunist forces further to their right. Within that camp was an active faction that called itself the "Revolutionary Democratic Current".

On the other side, a group led by former CPGB student organiser Fergus Nicholson was emerging&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.osa.ceu.hu/files/holdings/300/8/3/text/135-4-162.shtml EUROCOMMUNISTS PREVAIL IN BRITISH CP STRUGGLE 1983]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; that later became "[[Straight Left]]"; while French's Surrey District committee refrained from faction fighting which would have led to disciplinary action.

But the crisis came to a head the following year in the run-up to the Congress in November. The Gollan leadership had redrawn the British Road to Socialism aimed at - according to its detractors - adopting a social-democratic platform that sought the respectability and acceptance of academic and intellectual circles. The hardliners claimed it was the party's entrance fee into the reformist and social democratic traditions of the official labour movement. The publication of the draft and the beginning of the pre-Congress discussion period led to furious arguments within the party - with the majority saying that the new programme was about building a broad alliance for revolutionary social change, though implicitly or explicitly agreeing that the proposals broke with the [[Leninist]] tradition.

The Nicholson group argued that all the opposition should focus on making a stand at the November 1977 Congress. French led discussions with Nicholson and he was ready to go along with this strategy. But when it became clear that the party leadership was going to strike the first blow by expelling Sid French and a number of others in the Surrey district the formation of a new party became inevitable. On 15 July 1977 the New Communist Party was established at an emergency meeting in London called by French and other members of the Surrey district committee.

Support came largely from French's Surrey district stronghold though other supporters of his position, who had been contacted during the campaign against the new draft of the BRS, also joined immediately. But the decision to form the party in July had been made at the last moment. It took a further six weeks to organise the production of a party weekly, the New Worker, and issue the first pamphlet arguing the case for the new party.&lt;ref&gt;The Case for the New Communist Party - NCP Sept 1977&lt;/ref&gt;

The NCP failed to take many members in key districts of the CPGB, such as London, Scotland and South Wales in the run-up to the November CPGB Congress. There, Nicholson's supporters were overwhelmingly defeated and the new draft BRS adopted. The Nicholson group continued to oppose the CPGB leadership in an increasingly factional way while claiming that French's move had undermined the overall opposition at Congress. But the opposition had no chance of defeating the draft. Even if French's supporters had been at Congress their numbers together with Nicholson's group were still not enough to defeat the leadership bloc's support.

Some 6,000 members had left the CPGB by the end of 1977 in a membership decline that would accelerate throughout the 1980s. But only a fraction of them, put at around 700,&lt;ref&gt;487:Encyclopedia of British and Irish Political Organisations, Parties, Groups and Movements.Ed: McHugh, Tyldesley, Pendry, Bareris. Pinter Publishers 2000&lt;/ref&gt; joined the NCP.&lt;ref&gt;Marxism in Britain By Keith Laybourn P156&lt;/ref&gt;

==The New Communist Party==
Sid French became the first General Secretary of the NCP and [[Surrey]] became its strongest area. The first national chairman was Joe Parker, a full-time official in the [[National Union of Sheet Metal Workers and Coppersmiths]] (NUSMWC) until he retired in 1982. Joe Parker stepped down as Party Chairman soon after but remained an active NCP member until his death in 2004.

French died in 1979 and was succeeded by [[Eric Trevett]]. Trevett retired from full-time Party work in 1995 but remained on the [[Politburo]] of the Central Committee of the NCP as Party President, a post created in that year, until his death in September 2014.

Like the rest of the British communist movement the NCP from the beginning had to deal with what they saw as [[ultra-leftism]] and right-wing deviation. All were defeated at congresses over the years and many were expelled for factionalism. In the early 1980s an extreme pro-Soviet faction called "[[Proletarian (journal)|Proletarian]]"&lt;ref&gt;"ECONOMISM, TAILISM AND THE NEW COMMUNIST PARTY" 1981 gives their view&lt;/ref&gt; was expelled. In the early 1990s another small group was expelled which later formed the [[Communist Action Group]].

The party's 'Vote Labour Everywhere' strategy was changed in 2000 to support Ken Livingstone for London Mayor and this ultimately led to the biggest purge in the party's history. A vote at the central committee with a one-vote majority led to nine expulsions from the party of those opposed to the Livingstone decision for factionalism, and some subsequent resignations, including nine members of the central committee. The North West District was dissolved and altogether around 25 members were either expelled for factionalism or resigned from the party.

One of the NCP's better-known members was [[Ernie Trory]] (1913–2000), who founded the Crabtree Press to publish his political and historical writings. Three volumes, ''Between the Wars, Imperialist War'' and ''War of Liberation'', all sub-titled ''Recollections of a Communist Organiser'', cover unfolding political events from the Depression to the end of the [[Second World War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Books/s?ie=UTF8&amp;rh=n%3A266239%2Cp_27%3AErnie%20Trory&amp;field-author=Ernie%20Trory&amp;page=1|title=Amazon.co.uk: Ernie Trory: Books|work=amazon.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The General Secretary is [[Andy Brooks]], a founder member of the NCP and a member of the Central Committee since 1979. He had previously been international secretary, editor of the New Worker and deputy general secretary.

The NCP has never stood candidates in general or local [[Elections in the United Kingdom|elections]] and calls for support for the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] candidates. This policy was amended in 2000 to permit support for independent Labour candidates with mass support and the NCP backed [[Ken Livingstone]]'s successful bid for the [[Mayor of London|London Mayorship]].

The NCP is an affiliate of the [[Labour Representation Committee (2004)|Labour Representation Committee]] (LRC), a grass-roots membership organisation with around a thousand individual members and affiliates that was established in 2004. Four left Labour MPs are members of the LRC including the chair, [[John McDonnell (politician)|John McDonnell]] MP. The aim of the LRC is to set up socialist groups at every level of the Labour Party to confront "New Labour", oppose the war in Iraq, and resist privatisation and job cuts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.l-r-c.org.uk/|title=The Labour Representation Committee|work=l-r-c.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NCP is also a supporter of the Liaison Committee for the Defence of Trade Unions, a rank and file union committee supported by a number of left-leaning trade union leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lcdtu.co.uk/|title=Liaison Committee For The Defence Of Trade Unions|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|accessdate=October 2, 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080907205451/http://www.lcdtu.co.uk/|archivedate=September 7, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NCP is opposed to the [[European Union]] and the [[Treaty of Rome]], and calls on its supporters to boycott the European elections.

The organisational structure of the NCP consists of [[Fraction (politics)|Fractions]], Cells, District Committees, [[Central Committee]], and Political Bureau ([[Politburo]]). The highest body of the party is the National Congress, which determines policy and elects the Central Committee.

It produces a weekly newspaper called ''[[The New Worker]]''. Content is written either internally, or comes from other sources, particularly organs of fraternal parties. It no longer has a theoretical journal, having ended publication of the ''New Communist Review'' in the mid-1990s following the death of its editor George Woolley. In the 1980s and early 1990s the NCP also published an ''Industrial Bulletin'', ''Irish Bulletin'' and ''Economic Bulletin''. It produces ''Internal Bulletin'' for members and supporters, as well as various pamphlets on different subjects.

==Ideology==
The NCP began to internally criticise [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]'s leadership of the Soviet Union in 1988 and following the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] the party established relations with communist and workers parties throughout the world. In the 1990s Party Congresses adopted resolutions repudiating and denouncing [[Nikita Khrushchev]]'s anti-Stalin [[20th Party Congress|20th Congress]] [[Secret Speech|speech]] and defining its ideology around the "great revolutionary teachers of humanity, Marx, Engels, Lenin and Stalin" and the "great revolutionary leaders of the struggling masses, Mao Zedong, Kim Il Sung, Fidel Castro and Ho Chi Minh".

In April 1992 the New Communist Party was one of the initial signatories of the [[Pyongyang Declaration]], along with 77 other communist, workers, socialist and progressive parties worldwide. Entitled ''Let Us Defend and Advance the Cause of Socialism'', the declaration was the first statement made by the international communist movement since the dissolution of the Soviet Union, and to date has been signed by around 250 parties.&lt;ref&gt;http://harikumar.brinkster.net/AllianceIssues/AppendicesFinal.html{{dead link|date=March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003 the NCP adopted an entirely new rule book, with the aim of building a monolithic party and based on the principles laid down by the old [[Communist International]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.geocities.com/ncpcentral/ncprules.htm|title= Rules of the NCPB|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091027122316/http://www.geocities.com/ncpcentral/ncprules.htm|archivedate=2009-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The party is politically closest to what it sees as [[anti-revisionist]] Communist Parties who would see the Soviet leadership from [[Nikita Khrushchev]] onwards as stepping away from socialism. Internationally it supports [[Cuba]], [[China]], [[Vietnam]], [[Laos]] and the [[Democratic People's Republic of Korea]].

The NCP regularly attends the international conferences organised by the [[Communist Party of Greece]] (KKE),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.solidnet.org/redlink.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-10-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080929055025/http://www.solidnet.org/redlink.html |archivedate=2008-09-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and May Day events organised by the [[Workers Party of Belgium]] (PTB/PvdA).

In the UK, the NCP has very close relations with the [[Revolutionary Communist Party of Britain (Marxist-Leninist)]], despite having major programmatic differences on the question of the Labour Party and how to engage with DPRK.

The NCP is also involved in the anti-war movement, and supports the [[Stop the War Coalition]]
demonstrations.

The NCP has endorsed in March 2016 [[Grassroots Out]], the cross-party movement launched to campaign in favour of leaving the European Union.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

==Ancient era==

St. [[Mark the Evangelist]] is said to have founded the Holy Apostolic [[See of Alexandria]] and to have become its first [[List of Coptic Popes|Patriarch]].&lt;ref name="georgetown1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://berkleycenter.georgetown.edu/resources/countries/egypt|title=Egypt|publisher=[[Berkley Center for Religion, Peace, and World Affairs]]|date=|accessdate=December 14, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111220145046/http://berkleycenter.georgetown.edu/resources/countries/egypt|archivedate=December 20, 2011|df=}} See drop-down essay on "Islamic Conquest and the Ottoman Empire"&lt;/ref&gt; Within 50 years of St. Mark's arrival in Alexandria, a fragment of [[New Testament]] writings appeared in [[Oxyrhynchus]] (Bahnasa), which suggests that Christianity already began to spread south of Alexandria at an early date. By the mid-third century, a sizable number of Egyptians were persecuted by the Romans on account of having adopted the new Christian faith, beginning with the Edict of [[Decius]]. Christianity was tolerated in the Roman Empire until AD 284, when the Emperor [[Diocletian]] persecuted and put to death a great number of Christian Egyptians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jstor.org/pss/636357|title=Some Coptic Legends about Roman Emperors|publisher=|accessdate=2 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This event became a watershed in the history of Egyptian Christianity, marking the beginning of a distinct Egyptian or [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic Church]]. It became known as the '[[Era of Martyrs]]' and is commemorated in the [[Coptic calendar]] in which dating of the years began with the start of Diocletian's reign. When Egyptians were persecuted by Diocletian, many retreated to the desert to seek relief, though relief of the spirit and of its worldly desires to attain peace and unity with Christ the Creator, not escaping the persecutions. The practice precipitated the rise of [[monasticism]], for which the Egyptians, namely [[Anthony the Great|St. Antony]], [[Pachomius|St. Bakhum]], [[Saint Shenouda the Archimandrite|St. Shenouda]] and [[Saint Amun|St. Amun]], are credited as pioneers. By the end of the 4th century, it is estimated that the mass of the Egyptians had either embraced Christianity or were nominally Christian.&lt;ref&gt;Jankowski, James, ''Egypt: A Short History'' (One World (Oxford)), 2000, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt;

In 451 A.D., following the [[Council of Chalcedon]], the [[Church of Alexandria]] was divided into two branches. Those who accepted the terms of the Council became known as [[Chalcedonian]]s or [[Melkites]]. Those who did not abide by the Council's terms were labeled [[non-Chalcedonian]]s or [[Monophysites]] (and later ''Jacobites'' after [[Jacob Baradaeus]]). The [[non-Chalcedonian]]s, however, rejected the term [[Monophysites]] as erroneous and insisted on being called [[Miaphysitism|Miaphysites]]. The majority of the [[Egyptians]] belonged to the [[Miaphysitism|Miaphysite]] branch, which led to their persecution by the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] imperial authorities in [[Byzantine Egypt|Egypt]]. First persecutions occurred  during reigns of emperors [[Marcian]] (450-457) and [[Leo I the Thracian|Leo I]] (457-474).{{sfn|Meyendorff|1989|p=187-194}} This continued until the Arab conquest of Egypt. Tragic conflicts between Eastern-Orthodox Greeks and Oriental-Orthodox Copts during that era, from the middle of 5th to the middle of 7th century, resulted in permanent divisions and consequent emergence of ''anti-Eastern Orthodox'' sentiment among Copts and ''anti-Oriental Orthodox'' sentiment among Greeks.

==Islamic era==
{{Modern persecution of Coptic Christians}}

===Arab-Muslim conquest of Egypt===
The [[Muslim conquest of Egypt]] took place in AD 639. Despite the political upheaval, Egypt remained a mainly Christian land, but Copts lost their majority status after the 14th century. 


This process was sped along by persecutions during and following the reign of the [[Fatimid]] caliph [[Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah]] (reigned 996–1021). Later on Copts were forced to accept [[Arabic language|Arabic]] as a liturgical language by the [[Coptic Orthodox Patriarch of Alexandria|Pope of Alexandria]] [[Pope Gabriel II of Alexandria|Gabriel ibn-Turaik]].&lt;ref name="FA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shea|first1=Nina|title=Do Copts have a future in Egypt|journal=Foreign Affairs|date=June 2017|url=https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/egypt/2017-06-20/do-copts-have-future-egypt|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170620201311/https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/egypt/2017-06-20/do-copts-have-future-egypt|archivedate=2017-06-20|df=}}{{subscription required|via=Foreign Affairs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern era===
Observers note a large gap between&amp;nbsp;rights for Copts and other minorities that exists under the law and what exists in practice.&lt;ref name="Yerkes-20-6-2016" /&gt; (For example, while in 2016 the parliament worked to pass a bill making it easier for Christians to get government permission to build churches, in practice security officials have stopped actual construction.)&lt;ref name="economist-9-4-2017" /&gt;

In [[Egypt]] the government does not officially recognize conversions from Islam to Christianity; also certain interfaith marriages are not allowed either, this prevents marriages between converts to Christianity and those born in Christian communities, and also results in the children of Christian converts being classified as Muslims and given a Muslim education.

The government also requires permits for repairing churches or building new ones, which are often withheld.&lt;ref name="georgetown2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://berkleycenter.georgetown.edu/resources/countries/egypt|title=Egypt|publisher=[[Berkley Center for Religion, Peace, and World Affairs]]|accessdate=December 14, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111220145046/http://berkleycenter.georgetown.edu/resources/countries/egypt|archivedate=December 20, 2011|df=}} See drop-down essay on "Religious Freedom in Egypt"&lt;/ref&gt; Article 235 of the 2013 draft constitution requires the next legislative body to create a law that would remove the restrictions on the building of churches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/egyptsource/english-translation-of-egypt-s-2013-draft-constitution|title=English Translation of Egypt's 2013 Draft Constitution|work=Atlantic Council|date=6 December 2013|accessdate=24 December 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131218070420/http://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/egyptsource/english-translation-of-egypt-s-2013-draft-constitution|archivedate=18 December 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Foreign missionaries are allowed in the country only if they restrict their activities to social improvements and refrain from proselytizing.

Copts complain that disputes between Christians and Muslims are often put before "reconciliation councils", and that these councils invariably favour Muslims. Some Copts complain that the police do not respond when crimes are committed against them. Copts also have little representation in government, leading them to fear there is little hope of progress.&lt;ref name="economist-9-4-2017"/&gt;

In 1981, President [[Anwar Sadat]], internally exiled the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic]] [[Pope Shenouda III]] accusing him of fomenting inter-confessional strife. Sadat then chose five Coptic bishops and asked them to choose a new pope. They refused, and in 1985 President [[Hosni Mubarak]] restored Pope Shenouda III.

The government and other Egyptian sources blame tribal behavior in rural Egypt for much of the violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/WriterArticles/NewsContentP/1/749/Egypt/In-Qena-elections,-Copts-have-no-fear.aspx|title=In Qena elections, Copts have no fear|publisher=|accessdate=2 January 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160125080804/http://english.ahram.org.eg/WriterArticles/NewsContentP/1/749/Egypt/In-Qena-elections%2C-Copts-have-no-fear.aspx|archivedate=25 January 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://english.alarabiya.net/en/perspective/analysis/2014/04/11/Tribal-infighting-plagues-Upper-Egypt.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-07-20 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304105717/http://english.alarabiya.net/en/perspective/analysis/2014/04/11/Tribal-infighting-plagues-Upper-Egypt.html |archivedate=2016-03-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2015/02/egypt-tribes-families-role-parliamentary-elections.html#|title=Egyptian tribes shift their approach to politics – Al-Monitor: the Pulse of the Middle East|work=Al-Monitor|accessdate=2 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arabwestreport.info/en/year-1999/week-9/10-tribal-fanaticism-reigns-supreme-southern-egypt|title=10.

During Mubarak's regime (following that of [[Anwar Sadat]]), Copts were still struggling to avoid persecution but there were two appointed Coptic Ministers and one governor, in addition to one Copt ([[Naguib Sawiris]]) known as one the most successful businessmen in the world residing in Egypt, at the time. Today (early 2018) Copts face heightened persecution and marginalization as their churches get systematically attacked. Naguib Sawiris does not reside in Egypt anymore.&lt;ref name="″MAR″"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mar.umd.edu/assessment.asp?groupId=65101|title=MAR - Data - Assessment for Copts in Egypt|website=www.mar.umd.edu|accessdate=20 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However the killings were not committed in the village of Al Kosheh only in surrounding villages of Al Kosheh where Muslims are the majority. In the aftermath 38 Muslim defendants are charged with murder and possession of guns in connection with the deaths of the 20 Copts. But all are acquitted of murder charges, and only four are convicted of any (lesser) charges, with the longest sentence given being 10 years."

Morsi threatened but stopped short of decriminalizing Egypt's practice of female genital mutilation, carried out on almost three-quarters of Egyptian girls, making it clear he would not tackle an issue he called "a family matter".

'''Planned giving''' (less commonly known as gift planning [http://www.plannedgiving.com/downloads/whitepapers/planned-giving-vs-gift-planning.pdf]) is an area of [[fundraising]] that refers to several specific gift types that can be funded with cash, equity, or property.  These gift vehicles are commonly based on [[United States]] [[tax law]], but [http://www.cagp-acpdp.org/en/default.aspx Canada], the [[United Kingdom]], and [http://www.labforculture.org/en/funding/contents/philanthropy/european-association-for-planned-giving other nations] are beginning to establish similar laws. In the United States the specific rules of planned giving are defined by the [[United States Congress]] and the [[Internal Revenue Service]].

The term "planned giving" was coined {{Years ago|1972}} years ago by Robert F. Sharpe:

"A donor usually considers a current gift to your institution as a cash outlay now. To make a deferred gift, a person decides to give at some future date, either a number of years from now or at death. A deferred gift is a present decision to make a future gift, evidenced by a legal contract.

"While the name 'deferred giving' is best known to professionals in the field, it is not a term that communicates very much to the average donor. Therefore, we suggest the term 'planned giving.' When a person makes a planned gift, it suggests forethought."

—''[http://www.sharpenet.com/resources/give-and-take Give &amp; Take]'', a publication of the Sharpe Group, August 1972

Planned gifts are referred to as such because they require more planning, negotiation and counsel than many other gifts. Planned gifts can result in immediate income, income to charity over time or serve to delay a gift for life or other period of time while the donor or others retain income and/or access to the assets used to fund the gift. Because of the current or future charitable benefits, a number of state and/or federal income tax, capital gains, estate and gift benefits are associated with giving in this way.

Parents who have a child with a disability should ensure that the inheritance they leave for their child does not affect their child's eligibility to social assistance programs such as the [[Ontario Disability Support Program]] (ODSP). A [[Henson trust]] can be useful to ensure this.

Efforts to encourage planned gifts are popular among thousands of colleges, universities, hospitals, museums and community foundations in the United States. Funds generated through planned gifts are devoted to current funding needs as well as capital projects and endowments.

Reports published during and after the Great Depression of the 1930s indicate that planned gifts provided a higher percentage of philanthropic dollars than in times of economic prosperity. See "[http://www.sharpenet.com/images/UncertainTimes2.pdf Philanthropy in Uncertain Times - A Retrospective 1931-1949]" and "[http://www.sharpenet.com/oldsite/resources/pdf/sharpesummary.pdf Summary of Recent Research on Depression Giving]," from the Sharpe Group.

Research shows that planned giving may become considerably more important as a type of philanthropy in the United States due to the aging Baby Boomer population. This is often referred to as the "Great Wealth Transfer." See "[https://ssir.org/articles/entry/philanthropys_missing_trillions Philanthropy's Missing Trillions in the ''Stanford Social Innovation Review''.]

==Types of planned gifts==
By far, the most commonly utilized planned gift is the [[bequest]] of property through a person's final will. Other types include:

*[[Charitable bargain sale]]
*[[Charitable Gift Annuity (CGA)]]
*[[Charitable Remainder Annuity Trust (CRAT)]]
*[[Charitable remainder unitrust|Charitable Remainder Unitrust (CRUT)]]
*[[Charitable remainder trust]]
*[[Charitable lead annuity trust]]
*[[Charitable lead trust]]
*[[Donor Managed Investment Account]]
*[[Pooled income fund]]
*[[Retained life estate]]
*[[Testamentary life income]]

==Assets to give==
*[[Security (finance)|Securities]]
*[[Company|Business Interests]]
*[[Cash]]
*[[Life insurance]]
*[[Personal property]]
*[[Real estate]]
*[[Retirement plan]]

'''Poale Zion''' (also spelled '''Poalei Tziyon''' or '''Poaley Syjon''', meaning "Workers of Zion") was a movement of [[Marxism|Marxist]]–[[Zionism|Zionist]] [[Jew]]ish workers founded in various cities of [[Poland]], [[Europe]] and the [[Russian Empire]] in about the turn of the 20th century after the [[General Jewish Labour Bund in Lithuania, Poland and Russia|Bund]] rejected [[Zionism]] in 1901.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.yivoarchives.org/inholocdex.php?p=collections/controlcard&amp;id=34182&amp;q=p&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/po-alei-zion&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sztetl.org.pl/en/term/480,poale-zion/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formation and early years==
[[File:A group of Poalei Zion from Warsaw, 1905 -1.jpg|thumb|Poalei Zion members in [[Warsaw]], [[Congress Poland]], 1905]]
Poale Zion parties and organisations were started across the Jewish [[diaspora]] in the early 20th century. A branch of Poale Zion came into existence in [[New York City]] in 1903.&lt;ref&gt;Martin J Raffel “History of Israel Advocacy” in Alan Mittleman, Jonathan D Sarna and Robert Licht, eds, ''Jewish Polity and American Civil Society: Communal Agencies and Religious Movements in the American Public Sphere'' Lanham: Rowman &amp; Littlefield, p.106&lt;/ref&gt; Branches were formed in London and Leeds in 1903/04 and 1905 respectively&lt;ref&gt;Stuart A Cohen English Zionists and British Jews: ''The Communal Politics of Anglo-Jewry, 1895-1920'' Princeton University Press, p.59-60; William Fishman ''East End Jewish Radicals'' London: Duckworth 1975 p.306&lt;/ref&gt; and on a national basis in 1906.&lt;ref&gt;P. Mendes ''Jews and the Left: The Rise and Fall of a Political Alliance'', Springer, 20 May 2014, p.217&lt;/ref&gt; An Austrian group was formed in 1904, and published a newspaper, ''[[Yidisher Arbeyter]]''.&lt;ref&gt;P. Mendes ''Jews and the Left: The Rise and Fall of a Political Alliance'', Springer, 20 May 2014, p.158&lt;/ref&gt; In November 1905 the Poale Zion (Workers of Zion) Party was founded in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] and a month later the Socialist Jewish Labour Party (Poale Zion) was formed in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]].&lt;ref name="Jewish Labour Movement"&gt;[http://www.jlm.org.uk/cgi-bin/sitetools.cgi?task=servepage&amp;id=33 Jewish Labour Movement] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927211412/http://www.jlm.org.uk/cgi-bin/sitetools.cgi?task=servepage&amp;id=33 |date=2007-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1906 the [[Jewish Communist Labour Party (Poalei Zion)|Jewish Social Democratic Labour Party (Poale Zion)]] was created in Russia.&lt;ref name="Jewish Labour Movement"/&gt; In 1906 a formal Poale Zion party was formed in [[Poltava]], Ukraine,&lt;ref&gt;[[Geoffrey Alderman]] ''Modern British Jewry'', Clarendon Press, 1998, p.175&lt;/ref&gt; under the leadership of [[Ber Borochov]] and [[Itzhak Ben-Zvi]], and other groups were soon formed elsewhere in Europe. A French group was formed, under the leadership of [[Marc Jarblum]], which was influential on the [[SFIO]] and its leader [[Leon Blum]].&lt;ref&gt;June Edmunds ''[http://etheses.lse.ac.uk/2847/1/U615796.pdf The Left’s Views on Israel: From the establishment of the Jewish state to the intifada]'', LSE doctoral thesis, p.180&lt;/ref&gt;

The key features of the ideology of early Poale Zion were acceptance of the [[Marxist]] view of history with the addition of the role of [[nationalism]], which Borochov believed could not be ignored as a factor in historical development. A Jewish proletariat would come into being in the land of Israel, according to Poale Zion, and would then take part in the [[class struggle]]. These views were set out in Borochov's ''Our Platform'', published in 1906.

A World Union of Poale Zion was formed. The first World Congress took place in August 1907 in [[The Hague]]. Its second congress in 1909 in [[Kraków]] emphasised practical socialist projects in Palestine, further congresses followed in [[Vienna]] (1911 and 1920) and [[Stockholm]] (1919). 

In Ottoman Palestine, Poale Zion founded the [[Hashomer]] guard organization that guarded settlements of the ''[[Yishuv]]'', and took up the ideology of "conquest of labor" (''Kibbush Ha'avoda'') and ''Avoda Ivrit'' ("[[Hebrew labor]]"). The first formal congress of "The Jewish Social Democratic Workers party in the Land of Israel- Poalei Tziyon" was held in early 1907. Poale Zion set up employment offices, kitchens and health services for members. These eventually evolved into the institutions of labor Zionism in Israel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zionism-israel.com/dic/Poalei_Tziyon.htm Zionism and Israel - Encyclopedic Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1907, the party had 25,000 members in Russia.&lt;ref&gt;P. Mendes ''Jews and the Left: The Rise and Fall of a Political Alliance'', Springer, 20 May 2014, p.134&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[World War I]], Poale Zion was instrumental in recruiting members to the [[Jewish Legion]].{{cn|date=September 2017}} Poale Zion was active in Britain during the war, under the leadership of J Pomeranz and [[Morris Meyer]], and influential on the British labour movement, including on the drafting (by [[Sidney Webb]] and [[Arthur Henderson]]) of the [[Labour Party (Britain)|Labour Party]]’s War Aims Memorandum, recognising the '[[right of return]]' of Jews to Palestine, a document which preceded the [[Balfour Declaration of 1917|Balfour Declaration]] by three months.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Gorny The British Labour Movement and Zionism: 1917-1948 London: Frank Cass, ch.1&lt;/ref&gt; [[Poale Zion (Great Britain)|Poale Zion in Britain]] formally affiliated to the [[British Labour Party]] in 1920. The American party was led by veteran socialist Zionist thinker [[Nachman Syrkin]]. Whilst the Bund was forcibly disbanded in 1921, Poale Zion and [[Hechalutz]] were allowed to operate freely in the Soviet Union until 1928.&lt;ref&gt;P. Mendes ''Jews and the Left: The Rise and Fall of a Political Alliance'', Springer, 20 May 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Split==

Poale Zion was torn between Left and Right factions in 1919-1920, which formally split at the Poale Zion fifth world congress in Vienna in 1920, following a similar division that occurred in the [[Second International]].&lt;ref&gt;P. Mendes ''Jews and the Left: The Rise and Fall of a Political Alliance'', Springer, 20 May 2014, p.217&lt;/ref&gt;

The right wing was less Marxist and more nationalist, and favoured a more moderate socialist program and supported the [[International Working Union of Socialist Parties]] to continue the work of the Second International, essentially becoming a [[social democratic]] party. The left wing faction did not consider the Second International radical enough and some accused its members of betraying Borochov's revolutionary principles{{cn|date=September 2017}} (although  Borochov had begun to modify his ideology as early as 1914, and publicly identified as a social democrat the year before his death{{cn|date=September 2017}}). Poale Zion Left, which supported the [[Bolshevik revolution]], continued to be sympathetic to [[Marxism]] and [[Communism]], and attended the second and third congresses of the [[Communist International]] in a consultative capacity.&lt;ref&gt;P. Mendes ''Jews and the Left: The Rise and Fall of a Political Alliance'', Springer, 20 May 2014, p.100&lt;/ref&gt; They lobbied for membership, but their attempts were unsuccessful, as the internationalist communist movement under Lenin and Trotsky was opposed to Zionist nationalism. The Comintern advised individual members of Left Poale Zion to join their national Communist parties as individuals; at their 1922 Danzig conference, these terms were rejected by the party and the Comintern declared it an enemy of the workers' movement.&lt;ref&gt;P. Mendes ''Jews and the Left: The Rise and Fall of a Political Alliance'', Springer, 20 May 2014, p.100&lt;/ref&gt;

Poale Zion Left opposed the decision by Poale Zion to rejoin the World [[Zionist Organization]], viewing it as essentially [[bourgeois]] in character, and viewed the [[Histadrut]] as [[reformist]] and non-socialist. Aside from differing attitudes towards [[Zionism]] and [[Stalinism]], the two wings of Poale Zion parted ways over [[Yiddish]] and Yiddish culture. The Left was more supportive of the latter, similar to the members of the [[Jewish Bund]], while the Right bloc identified  strongly with the emerging [[Hebrew#Modern Hebrew|modern Hebrew]] movement in the early 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.yivoarchives.org/index.php?p=collections/controlcard&amp;id=34182&amp;q=p&lt;/ref&gt;

In Palestine, the major leaders of Poale Zion since their immigration in 1906 and 1907 had been [[David Ben-Gurion]], who joined a local Poalei Tziyon group in 1904 as a student at the [[University of Warsaw]], and [[Yitzhak Ben-Zvi]], a close friend of Borochov's and early member of the Poltava group. After the split the two ''Benim'' ("the Bens") continued to control and direct Poale Zion Right in Palestine. The party in Palestine split into right and left wings at its February 1919 conference. In October 1919, a faction of the Left Poale Zion founded ''Mifleget Poalim Sozialistiim'' (Socialist Workers Party) which became the [[Jewish Communist Party (Palestine)|Jewish Communist Party]] in 1921, split in 1922 over the Zionist issues, with one faction taking the name [[Palestinian Communist Party (1922)|Palestine Communist Party]] and the more anti-Zionist faction becoming the [[Communist Party of Palestine]]. The former retained its links to Poale Zion left. These two factions reunited as the [[Palestine Communist Party]] in 1923 and become an official section of the [[Communist International]]. Another faction of  Poale Zion Left, aligned with the kibbutz movement [[Hashomer Hatzair]], founded in Europe in 1919, became the [[Mapam]] party. Poale Zion Right, under Ben Gurion's leadership, formed [[Ahdut HaAvoda]] in March 1919. In January 1930 it merged with another party to become [[Mapai]], predecessor of the modern [[Israeli Labor Party]].

In Russia, the Poale Zion Left participated in the [[Bolshevik Revolution]]  and organized a brigade of Poale Zion activists &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hagshama.org.il/en/resources/view.asp?id=1343 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-09-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928004042/http://www.hagshama.org.il/en/resources/view.asp?id=1343 |archivedate=2007-09-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; nicknamed the "Borochov Brigade" to fight in the [[Red Army]]. The party remained legal until 1928 when it was liquidated by the [[NKVD]]. Most other Zionist organizations had been closed down in 1919, but Poale Zion Left remained untouched because it was recognized as a Communist party. In 1919, the Communists of Poale Zion Left split to form the [[Jewish Communist Party (Poalei Zion)|Jewish Communist Party]] which ultimately joined the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]], leading to a sharp loss of membership in Russia. 

In Poland, for a brief period following the war, both factions of Poale Zion were reported as legal and functioning political parties. The Polish Left party was the largest Left Poale Zion party in the world. It worked closely with the Bund in developing Yiddish schools in Poland and supporting secular Yiddish culture, although they had political differences (e.g. the Bund was more supportive of the Polish Socialist Party than LPZ). &lt;ref&gt;P. Mendes ''Jews and the Left: The Rise and Fall of a Political Alliance'', Springer, 20 May 2014, p.138&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the large-scale ban on Jewish political parties in post-war Poland by the Communist leadership, both Poale Zion groups were disbanded in February 1950.

In Austria, the left faction was led by [[Michael Kohn-Eber]], who joined the [[Austrian Communist Party]] in 1938. The right faction also remained active until 1938.&lt;ref&gt;P. Mendes ''Jews and the Left: The Rise and Fall of a Political Alliance'', Springer, 20 May 2014, p.158&lt;/ref&gt;

In America, the right faction was dominant, and initiated the [[National Labor Committee for Palestine]], raising money for Histadrut.&lt;ref&gt;P. Mendes ''Jews and the Left: The Rise and Fall of a Political Alliance'', Springer, 20 May 2014, p.217&lt;/ref&gt;

Globally, Poale Zion, under the leadership of [[Shlomo Kaplansky]] was involved in the 1921 formation of the centrist [[International Working Union of Socialist Parties]],&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Gorny The British Labour Movement and Zionism: 1917-1948 London: Frank Cass&lt;/ref&gt;  then between 1923 and 1930 the World Union of Poalei Zion (i.e. the PZ right) joined the [[Labour and Socialist International]] (as its Palestine section).&lt;ref name="kow"&gt;Kowalski, Werner. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=83QdPwAACAAJ Geschichte der sozialistischen arbeiter-internationale: 1923 - 19]''. Berlin: Dt. Verl. d. Wissenschaften, 1985. p. 314&lt;/ref&gt; As of 1928, it claimed to have 22,500 members in branches around the world; 5,000 in Poland and the United States, 4,000 in Palestine, 3,000 in Russia, 1,000 in Lithuania, Romania, Argentina and the United Kingdom, 500 in Latvia and another 1,000 scattered across countries such as Germany, Austria, Czechoslovakia, Belgium, France and Brazil. The general secretary of the World Union of Poalei Zion at the time was [[Berl Locker]]. The World Union had a women's wing, the Women's Organization for the Pioneer Women in Palestine.&lt;ref name="kon"&gt;[[Labour and Socialist International]].

IV. 100&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ihud Olami==
In 1932, Poale Zion's world federation merged with [[Hitahdut Olamit]], the World Union of [[Hapoel Hatzair]] and [[Zeirei Zion]] (which had been formed in 1920), to create '''Ihud Olami''', the World Union of Zionists-Socialists.&lt;ref&gt;Rafael Medoff, Chaim I. Waxman, ''Historical Dictionary of Zionism'', Routledge, 5 Sep 2013&lt;/ref&gt; In this period, several well-known Zionist leaders and politicians were active in Poale Zion, including Ben-Gurion, Ben-Zvi, kibbutz movement leader [[Yitzhak Tabenkin]], [[Jewish Agency]] Executive member [[Shlomo Kaplansky]], and future Israeli politicians [[Moshe Sharett]] and [[Dov Hoz]].

==The Holocaust==

The Holocaust-era Jewish resistance group [[ŻOB]] was formed from a coalition including [[Hashomer Hatzair]], [[Habonim Dror|Dror]], [[Bnei Akiva]], the [[General Jewish Labor Union|Jewish Bund]], various Jewish [[Communist]] groups, and both factions of Poale Zion. Poale Zion was also active in the [[Anti-Fascist Bloc]]. 

Several notable Jewish resistance fighters during the [[Holocaust]], particularly those involved in the [[Warsaw Ghetto Uprising]], were members of Poale Zion. They include:
* [[Adolf Berman]], Warsaw ŻOB fighter; Secretary of [[Zegota]]. (Poale Zion Left)
* Hersz Berlinski, member of Warsaw ŻOB Command (Poale Zion Left)
* Yochanan Morgenstern, member of Warsaw ŻOB Command (Poale Zion Right)
* [[Emanuel Ringelblum]], member of Warsaw ŻOB; chronicler of the Warsaw Ghetto. (Poale Zion Left)

==Poale Zion's legacy==

After [[World War I]], [[David Ben-Gurion]] integrated most of Poale Zion Right in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] into his [[Ahdut HaAvoda]] party, which became [[Mapai]] by the 1930s. The Poale Zion Left merged with the kibbutz-based [[Hashomer Hatzair Workers Party of Palestine]] and the urban-based [[Socialist League of Palestine]] to form [[Mapam]] in 1948, which in the 1990s merged with two smaller parties, [[Ratz (political party)|Ratz]] and [[Shinui]], to form [[Meretz]]. In 1946, a split in Mapai led to the creation of another small party, [[Ahdut HaAvoda|Ahdut HaAvoda - Zion Workers]], which united with Mapam in 1948. In 1954, a small group of Mapam dissidents left the party, again assuming the [[Ahdut HaAvoda|Ahdut HaAvoda - Zion Workers]] name. That party eventually became part of the [[Alignment (political party)|Alignment]] in a 1965 merger with [[Mapai]] (and later included [[Rafi (political party)|Rafi]] and [[Mapam]]). In 1992, the Alignment became the [[Labor Party (Israel)|Israeli Labour Party]].

Several youth movements have emerged out of Poale Zion: the Marxt [[Hashomer Hatzair]] (the largest, with 70,000 members on the eve of the Holocaust), the socialist [[Habonim Dror]], the Left Poale Zion's [[Yugent]], and [[Zeire Zion]].&lt;ref&gt;P. Mendes ''Jews and the Left: The Rise and Fall of a Political Alliance'', Springer, 20 May 2014, p.218&lt;/ref&gt;

In North America, Poale Zion founded the [[HeHalutz]] movement, the [[Farband]] and [[Habonim Dror]], and later the Labor Zionist Organization of America, which merged with other groups into the Labor Zionist Alliance, which rebranded itself in 2007 as [[Ameinu]]. US Poale Zion published a Yiddish newspaper, the ''[[Yidisher Kempfer]]'', and an English journal, ''[[Jewish Frontier]]'', edited by [[Hayim Greenberg]] and [[Marie Syrkin]].&lt;ref&gt;David Bridger, Samuel Wolk, ''The New Jewish Encyclopedia'', Behrman House, Inc, 1976, p.381&lt;/ref&gt;

In Britain, Poale Zion rebranded itself in 2004 as the [[Jewish Labour Movement]].

Internationally, the Poale Zion right is represented within the [[World Zionist Organization]] by the '''[[World Labour Zionist Movement]]'''; the group "to the left" of the WLZM within the WZO is Mapam's successor, the World Union of [[Meretz]]. Meretz and Mapam are both members of the [[Socialist International]]&lt;ref name=israel&gt;{{cite web|title=Israel|url=http://www.europeanforum.net/country/israel|publisher=European Forum for Democracy and Solidarity|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150115080802/http://www.europeanforum.net/country/israel|archivedate=2015-01-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, since 2013, the [[Progressive Alliance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://progressive-alliance.info/network/parties-and-organisations/|title=Parties &amp; Organisations|publisher=|accessdate=2 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Resistencia Ancestral Mapuche''' ({{lang-en|"Mapuche Ancestral Resistance"}}, RAM) is a [[separatist]] organization{{fact|date=May 2018}} group that operates near [[Patagonia]] in Argentina and Chile,{{fact|date=May 2018}} seeking to secede territories of both countries to create a [[Wallmapu|Mapuche nation]].

==Attacks==
In 2012, policeman José Aigo was killed when he tried to check a truck heading to [[Aluminé]]. Two Chilean organizations belonging to RAM, "[[Frente Patriótico Manuel Rodríguez]]" and the "Ejército Guerrillero de los Pobres", took credit for the killing of the officer.&lt;ref name="funciona"&gt;{{cite news|title=Cómo funciona la Resistencia Ancestral Mapuche, la organización que preocupa al Gobierno - TN.com.ar|url=http://tn.com.ar/politica/como-funciona-la-resistencia-ancestral-mapuche-la-organizacion-que-preocupa-al-gobierno_811403|accessdate=4 September 2017|work=Todo Noticias|date=7 August 2017|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{dubious|date=October 2018}} However, years before, different media attributed their murder to poachers, which led to the arrest of the son of the mayor of San Martín de los Andes who would be one of the hunters who shot the policeman&lt;ref&gt;{{cita web |url=http://www.laprensa.com.ar/388580-Un-policia-fue-asesinado-en-Neuquen-detienen-al-hijo-del-intendente-de-San-Martin-de-los-Andes.note.aspx |title=Un policía fue asesinado en Neuquén: detienen al hijo del intendente de San Martín de los Andes |trans-title= A policeman was killed in Neuquén: the son of the mayor of San Martín de los Andes is arrested | editor=La Prensa |date=7 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the first attacks of 2017 was committed at the [[National Route 40 (Argentina)|National Route 40]], burning a truck. The driver, Luis Rastrelini, 
commented that he was surprised by an improvised rock roadblock, and then was attacked by hooded men. They filled the truck with oil, and then made it explode with a [[molotov cocktail]].&lt;ref name="funciona" /&gt; Another attack took place in [[Bariloche]]. They burned two buildings, and left banners asking for the freedom of their leader, Facundo Jones Huala. Those banners featured their logo, composed by a mapuche shield and a rifle.&lt;ref name="funciona" /&gt; They also attacked the [[estancia]]s of the Italian clothing company [[Benetton Group]] at the [[Chubut Province]]. The watchman Evaristo Jones reported that they attacked and tortured him, stole his weapons and burned his shed, claiming that it was not an action against him but against the owners of the estancia.{{dubious|date=October 2018}}&lt;ref name="funciona" /&gt; The organization has been accused of committing similar attacks against other employees and their families, burned forests and farming grounds, vandalized the farming vehicles and the electric service, and the vehicles in the nearby roads.&lt;ref name="Maiten" /&gt;

==Disappearance of Santiago Maldonado==
{{Main article|Santiago Maldonado case}}
On August 1, 2017 people of the [[Lof]] [[Cushamen Department|Cushamen]] community protested for the freedom of the imprisoned member of the 
RAM, Facundo Jones Huala, blocking a road near [[El Maitén]], and were dispersed by the [[Argentine National Gendarmerie]]. Santiago Maldonado, a protester who supported the claims of the people blocking the road, was reported missing after that.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Goñi|first1=Uki|title=Argentina activist missing after indigenous people evicted from Benetton land|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/aug/08/argentina-santiago-maldonado-benetton-missing-activist|accessdate=26 August 2017|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=8 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Witnesses testified before judicial authorities that Maldonado was taken by Gendarmerie agents,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Devanna|first1=Cecilia|title=Los primeros testigos declararon ante fiscales|trans-title=The first witnesses declared before prosecutors|url=http://www.perfil.com/politica/los-primeros-testigos-declararon-ante-fiscales.phtml|accessdate=26 August 2017|work=[[Perfil]]|date=13 August 2017|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; and with the disappearance of Maldonado the RAM became known at national level in Argentina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Qué es y cómo actúa Resistencia Ancestral Mapuche, el grupo que se enfrenta al Gobierno en el Sur|trans-title=What is and how proceeds Resistencia Ancestral Mapuche, the group that confronts the government in the South|url=https://www.diariopopular.com.ar/general/que-es-y-como-actua-resistencia-ancestral-mapuche-el-grupo-que-se-enfrenta-al-gobierno-el-sur-n316804|accessdate=26 August 2017|work=[[Diario Popular]]|date=9 August 2017|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 4, a group of hooded vandals attacked the "Casa del [[Chubut Province|Chubut]]" building in [[Buenos Aires]], with some media{{who|date=May 2018}} attributing the attack to a reaction of members of the RAM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Un grupo de encapuchados destrozó la Casa del Chubut en Buenos Aires|trans-title=A group of hooded people destroyed the Casa del Chubut in Buenos Aires|url=http://www.infobae.com/sociedad/2017/08/04/un-grupo-de-encapuchados-destrozo-la-casa-del-chubut-en-buenos-aires/|accessdate=26 August 2017|work=[[Infobae]]|date=4 August 2017|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United Nations Committee on Enforced Disappearances has urged the Argentine government to search and locate Maldonado.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Santiago Maldonado’s Disappearance in Argentina: The UN Committee on Enforced Disappearances demands urgent state action.|url=http://www.cels.org.ar/web/en/2017/08/el-comite-contra-la-desaparicion-forzada-de-la-onu-exige-la-accion-}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prosecution is investigating the disappearance of Maldonado as a case of [[forced disappearance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cambiaron la carátula de la causa por Santiago Maldonado: lo buscan por "desaparición forzada".|url=https://www.minutouno.com/notas/3038878-cambiaron-la-caratula-la-causa-santiago-maldonado-lo-buscan-desaparicion-forzada|work=Minuto Uno|date=24 August 2017|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death of Rafael Nahuel==
On 25 November, 2017 the federal forces carried out an eviction. In this context, the Albatross group of the Prefecture repressed rubber bullets and lead bullets to the members of the Lafken Winkul Mapu community. Rafael Nahuel, aged 22, died in the shooting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Quién era Rafael Nahuel, el joven que murió en una represión de Prefectura|url=http://www.perfil.com/politica/quien-era-rafael-nahuel-el-joven-que-murio-en-un-operativo-de-prefectura.phtml?fb_comment_id=1474512455999133_1474514622665583#f37fcec58bd065|accessdate=5 January 2018|work=[[Perfil]]|date=26 November 2017|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; The autopsy confirmed that he died with a 9mm bullet, as those used by the Albatross group, ruling out a [[friendly fire]].&lt;ref name="9mm"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lanacion.com.ar/2086149-la-bala-que-mato-a-rafael-nahuel-es-una-9-mm-como-las-que-usa-el-grupo-albatros|title= La bala que mató a Rafael Nahuel es una 9 mm, como las que usa el grupo Albatros|trans-title= The bullet that killed Rafael Nahuel was a 9mm, as those used by the Albatross group|language= Spanish|author=Loreley Gaffoglio|date= November 27, 2017|publisher=La Nación |accessdate=January 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Minister of Security said that the death of the young Mapuche had taken place in the context of a confrontation, and that the Mapuche possessed weapons of war. The search took place some time later, and no weapon was found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mapuches denuncian que testigos del asesinato fueron detenidos y torturados|url=https://www.cronica.com.ar/policiales/Mapuches-denuncian-que-testigos-del-asesinato-fue-detenido-y-torturado-20171126-0045.html|accessdate=5 January 2018|work=[[Crónica (newspaper)|Crónica]]|date=26 November 2017|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as the RAM kept control of the crime scene after the event, it was suspected that it could have been altered.&lt;ref name="9mm" /&gt;

==Ideology==
The RAM released their [[manifesto]]{{dubious|date=October 2018}} on November 11, 2014. Their goal is to establish a mapuche nation, and they do not consider themselves Argentines or Chileans. They declared themselves enemies of [[capitalism]] and the state, and reject bureaucracy and the Argentine law. They also reject the [[Catholic Church]], as the religion of a "winka" god. They call themselves "Weichafes", a term in [[Mapuche language]] that means "warrior". They consider the RAM prisoners to be [[political prisoner]]s, and that they are victims of [[state terrorism]]. Aiming for [[self-determination]], they consider that the [[armed insurrection]] would be a legitimate action. They welcome the help of non-Mapuche people, as long as they follow their leadership.&lt;ref name="manifest"/&gt; 

Facundo Jones Guala is the visible face and member of the RAM. He is currently held prisoner in [[Esquel]], [[Chubut Province]]. He was interviewed by the TV program ''[[Periodismo para todos]]'', and said: "There are things that I can not conceal, like my political and ideological doctrine. We support the use of political violence as a weapon of self-defense. We plan the Mapuche liberation as the reconstruction of our world. We are the armed wing of the Mapuche movement: we use molotovs, knives, sticks. More than that, we can't afford".&lt;ref name="funciona" /&gt;

==Reactions==
Facundo Jones Huala is currently held prisoner in Argentina, and is on trial on terrorism charges. Chile asked for his extradition, to judge him for similar charges, but Argentina has refused to do so.&lt;ref name="terrorism"&gt;{{cite web |url= 
https://elpais.com/internacional/2017/08/03/argentina/1501790093_426310.html|title= Facundo Jones Huala: el líder mapuche que descoloca a Argentina y Chile|trans-title= Facundo Jones Huala: the mapuche leader who unsettles Argentina and Chile|language= Spanish|author= Ramiro Barreiro|date= August 6, 2017|publisher= El País|accessdate=August 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Argentine police has tried to drive them away from the estancias of the Benetton family, but were unsuccessful so far.&lt;ref name="terrorism" /&gt; The mapuche ''lonkos'' Camilo Nahuelquir and Raducindo Calfupan rejected the actions of the RAM, and pointed that their actions are not endorsed by the Mapuche populations.&lt;ref name="Maiten"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lanacion.com.ar/2051105-el-maiten-exige-el-regreso-de-la-gendarmeria-y-declara-como-actos-terroristas-a-las-acciones-de-ram|title= El Maitén exige el regreso de Gendarmería y declara como "actos terroristas" las acciones de RAM|trans-title= El Maitén demands the return of the gendarmerie and declares the actions of the RAM as "terrorist acts"|language= Spanish|author= Loreley Gaffoglio|date= August 8, 2017|publisher= La Nación|accessdate=August 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These coats of arms include the [[City of Salford]], the [[London Borough of Lewisham]], [[Eastleigh]], [[London Borough of Harrow|Harrow]], [[Lytham St. Anne's]], [[Tipton]], [[Mid Sussex]], [[West Lancashire]], [[Swinton and Pendlebury]], [[Urmston]] and [[Willenhall]];&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[http://www.ngw.nl/heraldrywiki/index.php?title=Mottoes_in_Latin Mottoes in Latin]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Manassas Park, Virginia]], the [[Duquesne University School of Law]], and is used as the motto of the [[Vlaams Belang|Vlaams Belang political group]] in the [[Belgian Chamber of Representatives]]{{fact|date=May 2015}}. The phrase is also used by the [http://portal.minv.sk/wps/wcm/connect/sk/site/top/uvod Ministry of Interior of the Slovak Republic] as an element on [https://www.google.sk/search?q=min+v+sk&amp;client=firefox-b-ab&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi75aOQ27rRAhWoE5oKHVkOBtkQ_AUICCgB&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=643#tbm=isch&amp;q=ministerstvo+vutra+sr&amp;imgrc=cLMtxLR0qPhA-M%3A its coat of arms]. It is present in a shortened form in an engraving of Oliver Cromwell by William Faithorne.

[[John Locke]] uses it as the [[Epigraph (literature)|epigraph]] in the form {{lang|la|Salus populi suprema lex}} in his ''[[Second Treatise on Government]]'' and refers to it as a fundamental rule for government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Locke |first=John |year=1689 |title=An Essay Concerning the True Original, Extent and End of Civil Government |at=Chapter XIII, section 158 |url=http://www.johnlocke.net/two-treatises-of-government-book-ii/}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the inscription on the cornet of [[Roundhead]] and [[Leveller]] [[William Rainsborowe]] during the [[English Civil War]]. This motto was also endorsed by Hobbes at the beginning of Chapter 30 of ''Leviathan'' and by Spinoza in Chapter 19 of his ''Theological-Political Treatise.'' It was frequently quoted as {{lang|la|'''Salus populi est suprema lex'''}}} since at least 1737.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/search?q=%22Salus+populi+est+suprema+lex%22&amp;tbs=cdr:1,cd_max:1850,sbd:1&amp;tbm=bks Google Books search] of books published before 1850&lt;/ref&gt;

The motto was featured on the masthead of the Irish medical journal [[Medical Press and Circular]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.ie/books?id=Sh5AAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The Dublin medical press|volume=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Commissioned Officers Association of the U.S. Public Health Service has adopted the phrase as its motto.

The [[Italian Army]] uses a similar motto, {{lang|la|'''Salus Rei Publicae Suprema Lex Esto'''}} ("The safeguard of the republic shall be the supreme law").

Madrid Regional Fire Service uses a similar motto, '''''Salus populi suprema Lex'''''

The '''School Breakfast Program''' provides federally subsidized [[breakfast]]s to children at schools and child care facilities in the United States. The program began as a 2 year  pilot in 1966. The program was supposed to serve schools in poor neighborhoods and in areas where kids had to travel a long distance in order to make it to school.  To get schools to participate Congress allowed for higher payments to schools that were defined as being in "severe need".  In its first year, the SBP spent [[US$]]573,000 serving about 80,000 children.  In 1971 Congress modified the program, making it available to schools who needed to improve the nutrition and dietary needs of children in low income families and with working parents.  They also changed the way funding was reimbursed, from categorical grant reimbursement to per-meal reimbursement.  The SBP was permanently authorized in 1975 for all schools who needed to provide better nutrition for their students and for higher reimbursement of the school.  Federal funding is provided in the form of cash reimbursements for each breakfast served, varied in amount by the family income of the participating child. &lt;ref name = "USDA"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.fns.usda.gov/cnd/breakfast/AboutBFast/SBPFactSheet.pdf |title= The School Breakfasat Program |publisher= [[USDA]] |author= Jay Rayner |date = 2012-08-01 |accessdate=2013-04-20}}
&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor= William A Dando |author=  Maria Cross, Barbara MacDonal |title= Nutrition in Institutions |pages = 89 |year=2009 |isbn=1405121254 |publisher = [[Wiley-Blackwell]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

All children in participating schools and residential institutions are eligible for a federally subsidized meal, regardless of family income. However, free meals must be offered to children from families with incomes below 130% of the [[federal poverty level]], and [[reduced price meal]]s to those with family incomes between 130% and 185% of the poverty level. Those families over the 185% poverty level have to pay full price for their meals which are set by the school.  Even though the children have to pay for their own meals, the school is still reimbursed.  The most current reimbursement rates for participating schools are $1.55 for each free breakfast, $1.25 for each reduced-price breakfast, and $0.27 for each paid breakfast.  A school may receive a higher reimbursement rate for serving free or reduced-price meals to more than 40% of their students in the previous year.  The higher rates can be as much as $0.30 more than standard rates.  Schools in Hawaii and Alaska receive higher reimbursement rates than the schools in the contiguous United States.  The percentage of meals being served at these higher rates is about 77%.  These reimbursements are active from July 1, 2010 through June 30, 2013. The program is administered by the [[United States Department of Agriculture]] (USDA) [[Food and Nutrition Service]] and funded by annual agricultural appropriations. &lt;ref name = "USDA"/&gt;

The USDA has to formulate their meal patterns and nutrition according to the Dietary Guidelines of Americans as directed by The Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010.  There are plans in place for the SBP to gradually start changing their meals in 2013.  Some of the changes include more whole grains, appropriate calorie counts according to grade, and lower sodium content.  The sodium content must be reduced enough to meet standards, at the latest, by the 2022-2023 school year. &lt;ref name = "USDA"/&gt;

As of 2010, the School Breakfast Program was the second largest of the targeted food aid programs administrated by the [[Food and Nutrition Service]], feeding 16 million children. This compares with the [[National School Lunch Act|School Lunch program]], which  helped feed 32 million children a day in 2010.  &lt;ref name = "walter"&gt;{{cite book

==Breakfast programs' effect on academic success==

Researchers have extensively studied the relationship between breakfast consumption and academic performance. It has been noted that breakfast consumption has a positive impact on student’s academic achievement. There is evidence that school breakfast programs have positive effects on a student’s ability to learn and function in school.&lt;ref name=Olsta&gt;Olsta, J. (2013). Bringing breakfast to our students: A program to increase school breakfast participation. The Journal of School Nursing, 29(4), 263-270. &lt;/ref&gt; Past discoveries have been made that students who participate in school breakfast programs have higher standardized test scores and lower levels of absenteeism.&lt;ref&gt;Meyers, A., Sampson, A., Weitzman, M., Rogers, B., &amp; Kayne, H. (1989). School breakfast program and school performance. American Journal of Diseases of Children, 143, 1234–1239.&lt;/ref&gt; More recent research has found a positive correlation between school breakfast program participation and academic grades, specifically in the subject of mathematics, along with a decrease in absences and lateness.&lt;ref name=Olsta /&gt; This was demonstrated by a research study on sixth-grade students in a Midwest urban school district who ate breakfast and had significantly higher math scores than their peers who had low nutrient intakes.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, J., Mauch, L., &amp; Winkelman, M. (2011). Relationship of nutrition and physical activity behaviors and fitness measures to academic performance for sixth graders in a midwest city school district. Journal of School Health, 81, 65–73.&lt;/ref&gt; According to recent research studies at Tufts University and the Bogalusa (LA) Heart Study, children and adults who eat a healthy breakfast are more likely to improve their memory, concentration, energy, endurance and mood as well as attend school more often.&lt;ref&gt;Rubin, K. (2003). Start the day off right: Healthy breakfast. Foodservice Director, 16(8), 38.&lt;/ref&gt; Breakfast consumption is also associated with cognitive abilities such as creativity, reasoning, vocabulary, and problem solving.&lt;ref&gt;Haesly, B., Nanney, M. S., Coulter, S., Fong, S., &amp; Pratt, R. J. (2014). Impact on staff of improving access to the school breakfast program: A qualitative study. Journal of School Health, 84(4), 267-274. &lt;/ref&gt; 

Engagement in a breakfast program has also shown to have a positive influence on psychosocial behavior.&lt;ref name=Olsta /&gt; In a study on high school students, male participants reported feeling more positive after eating a nutritious breakfast.&lt;ref&gt;Widenhorn-Muller, K., Hille, K., Klenk, J., &amp; Weiland, U. (2008). Influence of having breakfast on cognitive performance and mood in 13- to 20-year-old high school students: Results of a crossover trial. Pediatrics, 122, 279–84.&lt;/ref&gt; Within the same study, both male and female student participants reported feeling more alert after breakfast consumption.&lt;ref name=Olsta /&gt; All in all, healthy eating is essential for the growth and development of children and youth and schools have long been recognized as a setting for public health intervention. School breakfast programs have benefits for students’ academic, behavioral and social development.&lt;ref name=Valaitis&gt;Valaitis, R. F., Hanning, R. M., &amp; Herrman, I. S. (2013).

== School lunch nutrition program ==

The Trump Administration has eased certain policies to make American school lunches healthier. Some health advocates perceive the move as a significant change on lunch policies of former President Barack Obama&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usda-education-lunch/trump-administration-relaxes-some-obama-era-school-lunch-rules-idUSKBN17X2DG|title=Trump administration relaxes some Obama-era school lunch rules|last=Baertlein|first=Lisa|work=U.S.|access-date=2018-07-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;. There are fewer whole grains, more sugary chocolate milk, and an additional 300 milligrams of salt. According to Department of Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue, healthy meals given to school children since 2012 resulted in choosy kids who refused meals offered in their respective schools&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schwartz|first=Marlene B.|last2=Henderson|first2=Kathryn E.|last3=Read|first3=Margaret|last4=Danna|first4=Nicole|last5=Ickovics|first5=Jeannette R.|date=2015-6|title=New school meal regulations increase fruit consumption and do not increase total plate waste |journal=Childhood Obesity (Print)|volume=11|issue=3|pages=242–247|doi=10.1089/chi.2015.0019|issn=2153-2176 |pmc=4484709|pmid=25734372}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This resulted to more food being thrown away and wasted. Recent research disputed the claim of Perdue citing the findings that youngsters consume more veggies and a smaller amount of saturated fat at school&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/trump-administration-relax-school-lunch-rules-2018-1|title=Kids are eating less whole grains and more sugary milk in school lunches this year — see how federal rules have changed for the worse|work=Business Insider|access-date=2018-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Office of Budget Management Director Mick Mulvaney argued that proposed budget cuts for after-school programs came out because there is no clear proof the practice of feeding and educating children to perform better does not actually work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/budget-director-explains-trumps-proposed-cuts-meals-on-wheels-omb-white-house-press-briefing-2017-3|title=Watch Trump's budget director explain proposed cuts for after-school programs that feed children|work=Business Insider|access-date=2018-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Experts believe the proposal of Trump’s administration will set back the next stage of salt reduction by at least three years and eliminate further reductions that will happen following that development. Reductions of salt in school meals are based on recommendations from nutrition specialists of the World Health Organization, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, American Heart Organization, and Dietary Guidelines for Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://thehill.com/opinion/healthcare/371466-trump-puts-healthy-school-meals-at-risk|title=Trump puts healthy school meals at risk|last=Bachai|first=Sabrina|date=2018-01-30|work=TheHill|access-date=2018-07-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Singaporean Certificate of Identity''' is an international [[travel document]] issued by the [[Immigration and Checkpoints Authority]] to Singaporean permanent residents who are stateless.

==Use==
A holder of a Certificate of Identity can enter [[Germany]] and [[Hungary]] visa-free for a maximum of 90 days within a 180-day period.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2008:074:0040:0061:en:PDF Information pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 listing the third countries whose nationals must be in possession of visas when crossing the external borders and those whose nationals are exempt from that requirement]&lt;/ref&gt;  In the case of Germany, for holders of a COI to enter visa-free, their travel document must be endorsed and issued under the terms of the Convention relating to the Status of Stateless Persons of 28 September 1954.  However, as Singapore is not a signatory to the 1954 Stateless Persons Convention, in practice the visa exemption to Germany does not apply to any holder of the COI.  However, COI holders can nonetheless qualify for a visa exemption to [[Hungary]] since the Hungarian government does not require their travel document to be issued under the terms of the 1954 Stateless Persons Convention.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7397">The '''Standards and Privileges Committee''' of the [[United Kingdom]] [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] was established in 1995 to replace the earlier Committee of Privileges. Ten [[Member of Parliament|Members of Parliament]] sit to make recommendations to the House on complaints of breach of [[Parliamentary privilege]]. It was itself replaced on 7 January 2013, when it was split into the [[Committee on Standards]] and the [[Committee of Privileges]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title = Standards Committee |url = http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/standards/ |publisher = parliament.uk |accessdate = 5 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Committee was appointed by the House of Commons to oversee the work of the [[Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards]]. It examined the arrangements for the compilation, maintenance and accessibility of the Register of Members' Interests and considered specific complaints made in relation to the registering or declaring of interests and any matter relating to the conduct of Members, including specific complaints in relation to alleged breaches in the Code of Conduct which were drawn to the Committee's attention by the Commissioner.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5199">Water accounting is a discipline that seeks to provide comprehensive, consistent and comparable policy relevant information related to water.  Based on the experience of more than fifty years of national accounts, the discipline that provides the elements to calculate the [[Gross Domestic Product]] (GDP), the [[United Nations Statistics Division]] (UNSD) developed the '''System of Environmental and Economic Accounting for Water''' ('''SEEA-Water'''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://unstats.un.org/unsd/envaccounting/seeaw|title= System of Environmental-Economic Accounting for Water}}&lt;/ref&gt; which has been adopted by the [[United Nations Statistical Commission]] (UNSC) as a statistical interim standard in 2007.

The SEEA-Water is a conceptual framework for the organization of physical and economic information related to water using concepts, definitions and classifications consistent to those of the [[System of National Accounts]] 2008 (2008 SNA). The SEEA-Water framework is an elaboration of the handbook on Integrated Environmental and Economic Accounting 2003 (SEEA 2003) which describes the interaction between the economy and the environment and covers the whole spectrum of natural resources and the environment.

To support the implementation of SEEA-Water the [[United Nations Statistics Division]] (UNSD) developed the [[International Recommendations on Water Statistics]] (IRWS), &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://unstats.un.org/unsd/envaccounting/irws/|title= International Recommendations for Water Statistics}}&lt;/ref&gt; which has also been adopted by the UN Member States through the Statistical Commission.  The IRWS consolidates the experiences and practices of countries and international organizations.

In Australia, the Water Accounting Standards Board has released standards for producing general purpose water accounting reports.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bom.gov.au/water/standards/wasb.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; These standards are designed to complement the SEEA-Water, but to support the preparation of reports for a wider audience than statisticians and economists. The development of these type of standards is continuing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=  http://riskaudit.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Water-Accounting-Australia.pdf|title= Water accounting in Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Today more than fifty countries around the world are implementing of planning to implement water accounts.

==Background==
Water problems around the world are increasing; however, information useful for decision makers within the water sector and related to the water sector seems to be decreasing.  Solving water problems requires information from many disciplines.  The information has to be coherent and harmonized in order to provide an integrated picture useful for the assessment of the problems.

The SEEA-Water was designed specially to provide this much needed framework.  This framework is fully compatible with the framework used in the analysis of macro-economic variables throughout the world, which is the System of National Accounts (SNA), which allows to combine hydrologic and water use information with economic information.

The SEEA-Water has been adopted as an interim international standard.  It will become a standard once it is reviewed in the light of the new version of the [[System of Environmental and Economic Accounting]] (SEEA),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=  http://unstats.un.org/unsd/envaccounting|title= SEEA 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; which will be submitted for adoption in 2012.

==Main features==
The SEEA-Water covers all of the stocks and flows associated with water, which are organized in two main systems, the Inland Water Resources System and the Water Use System or Economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=  http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0021/002112/211296e.pdf|title= Monitoring Framework for Water}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The '''Inland Water Resources System''' includes all the elements of the natural hydrologic cycle: precipitation, evapotranspiration, surface water, groundwater, etc.  The '''Economy''' covers all the industries that use water, including agriculture, electricity production, all the different types of services, etc., as specified in the [[International Standard Industrial Classification]] of All Economic Activities (ISIC),&lt;ref&gt;ISIC rev 4 http://unstats.un.org/unsd/cr/registry/isic-4.asp&lt;/ref&gt; and households. 

All these elements are designated with a harmonized terminology and set up in standard tables.  This allows for the construction of comprehensive, consistent, and comparable indicators relevant for water policy making throughout the world.  The [[International Recommendations for Water Statistics]] (IRWS) provide further elements regarding terminology, definitions and data sources.

The integration of the water accounts in countries requires the combined efforts of different agencies and experts from different disciplines, which often requires special institutional arrangements.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9926">A '''tariff-rate quota''' ('''TRQ''') is a two-tiered international trade tariff that combines two policy instruments used historically to protect domestic production by restricting imports−[[Import quota]]s and [[tariff]]s. The quotas set a quantitative threshold for a designated time period for imports of a protected domestic product. Under that threshold, tariffs applied to imports are either very low or nonexistent.&lt;ref name="CRS_Womach_2005"/&gt;{{rp|254}} Over that threshold, imports are subject to a significantly higher tariff that is intentionally prohibitive.&lt;ref name="CRS_Womach_2005"/&gt;{{rp|254}} TRQs have been required by the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO) since the 1995 [[Uruguay Round|Uruguay Round Agreement]] 123 contract party nations engaged in international trade.&lt;ref name="CRS_Womach_2005"&gt;{{cite report |title = Report for Congress: Agriculture: A Glossary of Terms, Programs, and Laws Agriculture: A Glossary of Terms, Programs, and Laws, 2005 Edition |date=June 2005|url = https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metacrs7246/m1/1/high_res_d/97-905_2005Jun16.pdf |format=PDF|first= Jasper |last=Womach |pages=282 |quote="Tariff-rate quota — A trade policy tool used to protect a domestically-produced commodity or product from competitive imports.

Imports above the quota's quantitative threshold face a much higher (usually prohibitive) tariff.

==Tariff mechanisms==

In a TRQ, the quota component works together with a specified tariff level to provide the desired degree of import protection. Essentially, a TRQ is a two-tiered tariff. The first Q imports entering within the quota portion of a TRQ are usually subject to a lower tariff rate called the Inside tariff quota rate or ITQR. Imports above the quota's quantitative threshold (Q) face a much higher (usually prohibitive) Outside tariff quota rate or OTQR.&lt;ref name="CRS_Womach_2005"/&gt;{{rp|254}} The Q units are called the quota volume, and this volume serves as the cut off between the ITQR and the OTQR.

==Background==
Prior to the 1995 [[Uruguay Round|Uruguay Round Agreement]] signed by 123 countries, countries used import controls the 1983 World Trade Organization's [[Agreement on Agriculture]] (AoA), to the system of tariff-rate quotas (TRQs) required by WTO which came into effect in 1995.&lt;ref name="GC_TRQ"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.international.gc.ca/controls-controles/prod/agri/tarif.aspx?lang=eng |title=Tariff Rate Quotas : Agricultural Products |publisher=Government of Canada |date=September 26, 2013 |access-date=June 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under WTO authorized TRQs, rates of duty or tariffs up to a predetermined limit, are lower. Once the limit is reached, imported products can be subject a significantly higher tariff.&lt;ref name="CRS_Womach_2005"/&gt;{{rp|254}}&lt;ref name="GC_TRQ"/&gt; ]]By 2018, about 41 countries, including [[Canada]] and the [[U.S.]], had WTO approved tariff-rate quotas.&lt;ref name="Grey_2018"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/american-dairy-farmers-depend-on-government-subsidies-673374473.html |work=Grey, Clark, Shih and Associates Limited |date=February 8, 2018 |title=American dairy farmers depend on government subsidies |access-date=June 25, 2018 |quote="he study, which focuses on changes introduced by the 2014 Farm Bill, shows that in 2015, the American government doled out approximately $22.2 billion dollars in direct and indirect subsidies to the U.S dairy sector."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tariff-rate quota by country==
===United States===
According to the [[United States Department of Agriculture]] (USDA)'s [[Foreign Agricultural Service]] (FAS), the dairy products tariff-rate quota (TRQ) system is administered through import licensing through lower and higher tier tariff-rates. Importers of dairy products that are identified as eligible for the low-tier tariff rate must apply annually to the FAS for a license.&lt;ref name="FAS_USDA"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fas.usda.gov/programs/dairy-import-licensing-program |title=Dairy Import Licensing Program |publisher=[[United States Department of Agriculture]] (USDA) [[Foreign Agricultural Service]] (FAS) |date=nd |access-date=July 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===South Africa===
For example, in 2013, [[South Africa]] applied the following TRQ on imports of "Frozen cuts and edible offal of fowls of the species ''Gallus domesticus''", a type of chicken (HS code 02071420) originating from the United States of America:

*Inside tariff quota rate  (ITQR): 16.4%
*Outside tariff quota rate  (OTQR): 27.0%
In 2013, the cut-off for this quota rate was 29,033 tonnes of imported offal / year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macmap.org/QuickSearch/FindTariff/FindTariffResults.aspx?product=SimpleProduct%7C%7C02071420%7CINCpsep02071420+-+Meat+and+edible+offal,+of+the+poultry+of+heading+01.05,+fresh,+chilled+or+frozen+:+Of+fowls+of+the+species+GALLUS+DOMESTICUS+:+Cuts+and+offal,+frozen+:+Offal&amp;country=SCC710%7CSouth+Africa&amp;partner=SCC842%7CUnited+States+of+America&amp;year=2013&amp;source=1%7CITC&amp;AVE=1|title=Market Access Map - Improving transparency in international trade and market access|first=International Trade Centre|last=(ITC)|website=www.macmap.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several different ways in which quotas can be administered by governments:&lt;ref&gt;International Trade Centre (ITC), Market Analysis &amp; Research section, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Quota administration method !! Explanation
|-
| First-come, first-served  || No shares are allocated to importers.  Imports are permitted entry at the in-quota tariff rates until such a time as the tariff quota is filled; then the higher tariff automatically applies.  The physical importation of the good determines the order and hence the applicable tariff. 
|-
| Licenses on demand || Importers' shares are generally allocated, or licenses issued, in relation to quantities demanded and often prior to the commencement of the period during which the physical importation is to take place.  This includes methods involving licenses issued on a first-come, first-served basis and those systems where license requests are reduced pro rata where they exceed available quantities. 
|-
| Auctioning || Importers' shares are allocated, or licenses issued, largely on the basis of an auctioning or competitive bid system. 
|-
| Historical importers || Importers' shares are allocated, or licenses issued, principally in relation to past imports of the product concerned. 
|-
| Imports undertaken by state trading entities || Import shares are allocated entirely or mainly to a state trading entity which imports (or has direct control of imports undertaken by intermediaries) the product concerned. 
|-
| Producer groups or associations || Import shares are allocated entirely or mainly to a producer group or association which imports (or has direct control of imports undertaken by the relevant Member) the product concerned.

As part of the 1995 [[Uruguay Round Agreement on Agriculture]], the [[World Trade Organization]] prohibited agricultural trade quotas among its member nations. TRQs, however, were permitted as a form of transition to simple tariffs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/international-markets-trade/trade-policy/world-trade-organization-%28wto%29/agreement-on-agriculture-and-beyond.aspx|publisher=[[USDA]]|title=AoA Issues Series: Tariff-Rate Quota Administration|accessdate=2009-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Asof|2005}}, TRQs apply to U.S. imports of certain dairy products, beef, cotton, green olives, peanuts, peanut butter, sugar, certain sugar-containing products, and tobacco.&lt;ref name="CRS_Womach_2005"/&gt; A TRQ was applied to US [[steel]] imports in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tariff Rate Quotas on U.S. Steel Imports: The Implications on Global Trade and Relative Competitiveness of Industries|url=https://www.gtap.agecon.purdue.edu/resources/download/1529.pdf|publisher=[[Purdue University]]|accessdate=2009-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===European Union===
For [[Brexit]], the paragraph 13 of the EU's negotiating guidelines consider that the UK and the EU have to agree to manage the TRQ.

===China===
The [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO)'s [[Dispute settlement in the World Trade Organization|Dispute Settlement System]] agreed in September 2017 to create a panel to rule on the United States' complaint against China's TRQs on agricultural products.&lt;ref name="WTO_China_report_2018"&gt;{{cite report |url=https://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/tpr_e/s375_e.pdf |format=PDF |series=Trade Policy Review Body |title=Trade Policy Review Report by the Secretariat China |work=[[World Trade Organization]] (WTO) |date=June 6, 2018 |access-date=July 26, 2018 |pages=193 |number=18-3455}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The effect of [[social welfare]] on [[poverty]] is controversial in the [[United States]]. Since the goal of welfare programs is to [[Poverty reduction|reduce poverty]], it has been debated whether or not welfare programs achieve this goal. Welfare programs enjoy more popularity in virtually every other developed country.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/government_programs/july-dec06/welfare_08-22.html Debate over Welfare Reform Lingers 10 Years Later], PBS Newshour&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brookings.edu/speeches/2005/0304childrenfamilies_waller.aspx The Federal Welfare Debate: Is Congress Deserting Working Families?], Brookings Institution&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents argue welfare has reduced poverty in developed countries while opponents argue welfare creates a negative [[incentive]] to not find work and thus sustains or even creates poverty.

Two studies compare countries internationally before and after implementing social welfare programs. Using data from the Luxembourg Income Study, Bradley et al. and Lane Kenworthy measure the poverty rates both in relative terms (poverty defined by the respective governments) and absolute terms (poverty defined by 40% of [[Household income in the United States|United States median income]]), respectively. Kenworthy's study also adjusts for economic performance and shows that the economy made no significant difference in uplifting people out of poverty.

The studies look at the different countries from 1960 to 1991 (Kenworthy) and from 1970 to 1997 (Bradley et al.). Both these periods are roughly when major welfare programs were implemented such as the [[War on Poverty]] in the United States. The results of both studies show that poverty has been significantly reduced during the periods when major welfare programs were created.

A study done by [[Columbia University]] found that since the beginning of the War on Poverty the American poverty rate was reduced "from 26 percent in 1967 to 16 percent in 2012".&lt;ref name="Goldfarb"/&gt; However, Kevin Drum has criticized the study for combining elderly (in which most of the reduction happened) with non-elderly poverty reduction which was much less significant.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2013/12/new-study-says-poverty-rate-hasnt-budged-40-years New Study Says Poverty Rate Hasn't Budged For 40 Years], Mother Jones.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the book ''Losing Ground'', [[Charles Murray (political scientist)|Charles Murray]] argues that welfare not only increases poverty, but also increases other problems such as [[single-parent household]]s, and crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|year=1984|url=|title=Losing Ground: American Social Policy 1950–1980|publisher=Basic Books|last=Murray|first=Charles|authorlink=Charles Murray (political scientist)|pages=58, 125, 115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some [[Socialism|socialists]] and [[Marxism|Marxists]] argue that welfare states and modern [[Social democracy|social democratic]] policies limit the incentive system of the market by providing things such as minimum wages, unemployment insurance, taxing profits and reducing the reserve army of labor, resulting in capitalists having little incentive to invest. In essence, social welfare policies cripple the capitalist system and increase poverty. By implementing public or [[Worker cooperative|cooperative ownership]] of the [[means of production]], some socialists believe there will be no need for a welfare state.&lt;ref&gt;[http://marxists.org/glossary/terms/w/e.htm#welfare Encyclopedia of Marxism: Glossary of Terms]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard D.

"...the best solutions to pressing social problems lie in going well beyond the state and welfare ("socialist") reforms of the past in the precise sense of changing the organization of enterprises, democratizing them into WSDEs (workers' self-directed enterprises)."&lt;/ref&gt;

== Public opinion ==
In 2013, a NBC News/''Wall Street Journal'' poll found that a plurality of Americans (24 percent) said "too much government welfare that prevents initiative" was the leading cause of poverty.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://tv.msnbc.com/2013/06/06/poll-americans-blame-government-welfare-for-poverty/ Poll: Americans blame ‘government welfare’ for poverty]," msnbc.com&lt;/ref&gt;

A January 2014 Pew Research poll found that 49% of Americans believe government aid to the poor does more good than harm as people can not escape poverty until [[basic needs]] are met and 54% believe taxes should be increased on the wealthy and corporations to expand anti-poverty programs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.people-press.org/2014/01/23/most-see-inequality-growing-but-partisans-differ-over-solutions/ Most See Inequality Growing, but Partisans Differ over Solutions].

'''Wouter Basson''' (born 6 July 1950) is a South African  [[cardiology|cardiologist]] and former head of the country's secret [[chemical warfare|chemical]] and [[biological warfare]] project, [[Project Coast]], during the [[South Africa under apartheid|apartheid era]].&lt;ref name="unidir.org"&gt;[http://www.unidir.org/pdf/ouvrages/pdf-1-92-9045-144-0-en.pdf Project Coast: Apartheid's Chemical and Biological Warfare Programme.

Among other charges, Basson was alleged to have supplied a "lethal triple cocktail of powerful muscle relaxants which were used during [[Project Coast|Operation Duel]] (the systematic elimination of [[SWAPO]] prisoners of war and [[South African Defence Force]] (SADF) members who posed a threat to South African covert operations).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

==Project Coast==
{{main article|Project Coast}}
Much of what Basson was working on is still secret. It is known that in 1981, when he was working as a personal physician to state president [[P. W. Botha]], the country's Surgeon-General hired Basson to work for and form [[7 Medical Battalion Group]], a specialist unit of the [[South African Military Health Service]]. His job was to collect information about other countries' [[Chemical weapon|chemical]] and [[biological warfare]] capabilities under the name [[Project Coast]]. After his preliminary report, Basson became the head project officer and began to work on the country's chemical and biological weapons capability. He recruited about 200 researchers from around the world and received annual funds equivalent to [[USD|$]]10 million. In 1982, Basson is alleged to have arranged the killing of 200 [[SWAPO]] prisoners in ''Operation Duel''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Project Coast secretly researched chemical and biological warfare in violation of the international [[BTWC]] agreement. Basson created four [[front company|front companies]]; [[Delta G Scientific Company]]; [[Roodeplaat Research Laboratories]] (RRL), [[Protechnik]] and [[Infadel]], which in 1989 was split into two companies – D. John Truter Financial Consultants and Sefmed Information Services. The companies were used to officially distance the military from the project, to procure necessary chemicals and channel funds for the research. According to later investigation, Basson had a free rein to do what he wanted. Delta G did most of the research, production and development of the chemical agents, while RRL developed chemical and biological [[pathogen]]s and allegedly was involved with [[genetic engineering]]. Protechnik was a large nuclear, biological and chemical warfare plant developing defences against chemical weapons. Infadel dealt with those on a smaller scale and concentrated on financing and administration of other units and possibly channelling funds between military and research facilities. Many of the employees were not aware of what they were involved with.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s Basson and the project were allegedly involved with attacks and assassinations against members of [[Internal resistance to South African apartheid|anti-apartheid movements]]. Leaders in South Africa, Angola and Namibia also claimed that the more dangerous chemicals were used for [[crowd control]] in the country, although the government claimed otherwise and claimed that chemical weapons were used against South African troops. Basson provided the [[Civil Cooperation Bureau]] (CCB) with lethal chemicals to be used against prominent anti-apartheid activists. Basson continued to travel all over the world to gather information about chemical and biological warfare programs and set up other [[shell company|shell]] and [[paper company|paper companies]] as additional front companies, possibly for [[money laundering]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[F. W. de Klerk]] became president in 1990, he ordered that production of the chemicals be stopped and the lethal agents destroyed. Basson concentrated on non-lethal chemical agents and chemicals the government had not banned. That included a large amount of [[methylenedioxymethamphetamine|ecstasy]] and [[Mandrax]] that were apparently exported or allegedly sold to drug dealers in communities active in the anti-apartheid movement (cf. Basson brownies).  Most of the stockpile disappeared afterwards. Scientists working on the project later stated that they believed it was to be used to create drug-laced [[tear gas]]. In January 1992, FRELIMO troops conducted an operation near the South African border. During the course of the operation, they were allegedly exposed to what was thought to have been a chemical agent. Some of the soldiers died during the incident and others required hospitalisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nelsonmandela.org/omalley/index.php/site/q/03lv02167/04lv02264/05lv02335/06lv02357/07lv02372/08lv02378.htm|title=Chapter 6: Special Investigation into the death of President Samora Machel - The O'Malley Archives|website=www.nelsonmandela.org|access-date=2017-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Investigation by the [[United Nations]], United States and the United Kingdom identified it as [[3-quinuclidinyl benzilate|BZ]] nerve agent. US and Britain began to pressure the South African government and in January 1993 Project Coast was wound down. Basson was officially retired and hired to dismantle the project, and allegedly profited when some of the South African front companies were [[privatisation|privatised]]. Later government investigation found that there were large amounts of chemicals and agents missing.

==TRC investigation==
In 1993 the [[Office of Serious Economic Offences]] (OSEO) began to investigate Basson's business dealings in an unheard of seven year [[forensic audit]]. In 1995 the South African government hired Basson to work for [[Transnet]], a transportation and infrastructure company and possibly for other more secretive jobs. The US and UK governments suspected that during his visits to [[Libya]] between 1993-1995, Basson might have sold chemical and biological weapons secrets. In 1995, the government of [[Nelson Mandela]] rehired Basson as an army surgeon, allegedly due to US and UK pressure and possibly because the government wanted to keep an eye on him.

In 1996, South Africa’s [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (South Africa)|Truth and Reconciliation Commission]] (TRC) began to investigate the SADF and determined that the army had probably used lethal toxins against ANC activists. Basson was connected to many of these attacks. In 1997, the CIA told the South African government that Basson intended to leave the country. When Basson was arrested in a [[sting operation]] in [[Pretoria]] in 1997, he had 1000 [[MDMA|ecstasy]] tablets with him. At the time, he had hundreds of secret [[Project Coast]] documents in his car. TRC began to investigate Project Coast which led them to suspect that Basson had sold his secrets to governments of countries like Libya and [[Iraq]]. In 1997 they asked the help of the [[Netherlands Institute for Southern Africa]] (NIZA) whose investigation report was included in the Truth Commission Files.

At the same time, the Office for Serious Economic Offences, the [[National Intelligence Agency (South Africa)|National Intelligence Agency]] (NIA) and the Gauteng Attorney-General's Special Investigation Team investigated Basson's affairs. Conflict of interest slowed down the Commission investigation but the TRC gained more information from OSEO. Basson appeared before the TRC on 31 July 1998 and gave evidence for 12 hours.&lt;ref name="unidir.org"/&gt; While his  lawyers constantly interrupted the questioning with legal technicalities, the Commission determined that Basson had been the primary decision maker in Project Coast and should be put on trial.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZJ7eAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22Secrets+and+Lies:+Wouter+Basson+and+South+Africa%27s+Chemical+and+Biological+Warfare+Programme.%22&amp;dq=%22Secrets+and+Lies:+Wouter+Basson+and+South+Africa%27s+Chemical+and+Biological+Warfare+Programme.%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=_h8CU6uhJ8KstAaXoIGYDw&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAA/ Secrets and Lies: Wouter Basson and South Africa's Chemical and Biological Warfare Programme] Gould &amp; Marlene Burger, Struik Publishers, 2002
{{ISBN|9781868723416}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trial==
Basson’s trial began on 4 October 1999 in [[Pretoria]]. At the time, the South African media had dubbed him "Dr Death". Basson faced 67 charges, including [[drug possession]], [[drug trafficking]], [[fraud]] and [[embezzlement]] of a total of R36,000,000, 229 [[murder]]s and [[conspiracy to murder]] and [[theft]]. Basson refused to seek [[amnesty]] from the Truth Commission. The prosecution presented 153 witnesses, but the case soon began to turn against them. On 11 October 1999 Judge [[Willie Hartzenberg]] dismissed six important charges, including four charges of murder and possible involvement in 200 deaths in Namibia, because he stated that the South African court could not prosecute crimes committed in other countries. Basson was also included in the Namibian amnesty of 1989. Hartzenberg then adjourned the trial for two weeks. After 18 months of trial, he reduced the number of charges to 46.

Basson called only one witness – himself. In July 2001 Basson began to present his own evidence, speaking for 40 days. He stated that he had learned about [[weapons of mass destruction]] from [[Saddam Hussein]], that he had indeed had free rein in the project and that he had exchanged information with foreign governments. Technically, all that was legal. The defence argued that Basson should have immunity for anything that had happened in Namibia. On 22 April 2002 Judge Hartzenberg dismissed all the remaining charges against Basson and granted him [[amnesty]]. In his judgement, the judge called the state's case "fragmented and confusing", and that it was largely superficial, hoping to convince the court of Basson's guilt in a manner which fell far short of the standard "beyond reasonable doubt". Judge Hartzenberg further added that the state seemed to have decided what the truth was and had urged the court not to believe anything that contradicted the state's version of the truth.&lt;ref&gt;'Dr Death' walks free&lt;/ref&gt; The trial had lasted 30 months. The state tried to appeal the judgement due to legal inaccuracies, but the Supreme Court of Appeal refused to order a retrial in 2003, a step reserved for appeals that had no chance of success.{{fact|date=April 2018}}

After his release, Basson continued to travel all over the world as a guest speaker, and has founded his own private medical practice. In June 2005, a group of Swiss investigators questioned him about illegal trade in weapons and nuclear material and asked the South African government to stop cooperating with him.{{clarify|date=April 2018}}{{fact|date=April 2018}}

Later that year the [[Constitutional Court of South Africa|Constitutional Court]], South Africa's highest court, overturned the judgement of the [[Supreme Court of Appeal of South Africa|Supreme Court of Appeal]]. It ruled that crimes allegedly committed outside the country could be prosecuted in South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

|accessdate=9 February 2009
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then the [[National Prosecuting Authority]] has not instituted proceedings against Basson for [[crimes against humanity]].

==HPCSA ruling==
In 2006, the [[Health Professions Council of South Africa]] (HPCSA) started its own process of investigating Basson’s conduct. A charge sheet was drawn up and the inquiry began in November 2007.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;TRC evidence at Basson hearing: http://www.iol.co.za/news/politics/trc-evidence-at-basson-hearing-1.1547820#.UeV3To2mh3p&lt;/ref&gt; Out of the seven charges levelled against Basson, four full indictments remain after the HPCSA discharged two charges and part of a third charge against him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| newspaper = BBC| url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-16756908| date = 27 January 2012| title = South Africa: Walter Basson to answer misconduct case}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 May 2010 the application by Wouter Basson to the South African High Court was rejected. The application to the High Court attempted to have the charges set aside as unlawful, unreasonable and unfair. The judge found that there was no evidence to suggest that the Council was in any way biased or prejudiced against the doctor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hpcsa.co.za/downloads/press_releases/current/hpcsa_applauds_high_court%20_ruling_on_dr_dasson.pdf HPCSA applauds High Court ruling on Basson] May 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 December 2013, the HPCSA found Basson guilty of unprofessional conduct on four charges.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.politicsweb.co.za/politicsweb/view/politicsweb/en/page71651?oid=485471&amp;sn=Detail&amp;pid=71651/ HPCSA finds Basson guilty of unprofessional conduct] 18 December 2013&lt;/ref&gt; On 4 June 2014 sentencing procedure was postponed due to unavailability of counsel.
