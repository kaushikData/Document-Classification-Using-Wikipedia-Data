The right one depicts mournful Aino weeping on the shore and listening to the call of the maids of [[Vellamo]] who are playing in the water. The central pane depicts fishing Väinämöinen having thrown away a small fish, now turning out to be Aino, who laughs at him and vanishes forever.]] 

'''Aino''' is a figure in the [[Finland|Finnish]] [[national epic]] [[Kalevala]]. It relates that she was the beautiful sister of [[Joukahainen]]. Her brother, having lost a singing contest to the storied [[Väinämöinen]], promised Aino's "hands and feet" in marriage if Väinämöinen would save him from drowning in the swamp into which Joukahainen had been thrown. Aino's mother was pleased at the idea of marrying her daughter to such a famous and well born person, but Aino did not want to marry such an old man. Rather than submit to this fate, Aino drowned herself (or ended up as a [[Neck (water spirit)|nix]]). However, she returned to taunt the grieving Väinämöinen as a [[salmon]].

The name ''Aino'', meaning "the only one",  was invented by [[Elias Lönnrot]] who composed the Kalevala. In the original poems she was mentioned as "the only daughter" (''aino tytti'').

==National romanticism==

During the [[Romantic nationalism|national romantic]] period at the end of the 19th century the mythological [[Aino (given name)|name Aino]] was adopted as a [[Christian name]] by [[Fennoman]] activists. Among the first to be named so were [[Aino Järnefelt]] ([[Aino Sibelius]]), born 1871 and Aino Krohn (the later [[Aino Kallas]]), born 1878.

According to the Finnish Population Register Centre, over 60,000 women have been given the name. It was especially popular in the early 20th century, and the most common first name for women in the 1920s. &lt;sup&gt;[http://www.vaestorekisterikeskus.fi/vrk/home.nsf/pages/index_eng]&lt;/sup&gt; It has returned to favor in the 21st century; it was the most popular name for girls in Finland in 2006 and 2007.&lt;sup&gt;[http://www.hs.fi/english/article/Aino+and+Eetu+top+list+of+most+popular+childrens+names+/1135231071996]&lt;/sup&gt;

'''"Als het om de liefde gaat"''' ("When it's all about love") was the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] entry in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1972]], performed in [[Dutch language|Dutch]] by the duo [[Sandra Reemer|Sandra]] &amp; [[Dries Holten|Andres]], Sandra Reemer and Dries Holten. The Eurovision performance of this entry is memorable for being one of the first in Eurovision history wherein the audience clapped to the rhythm of the song.

The song is a duet, with the singers making a series of attempts at chatting each other up. They explain their difficulties by saying that it is difficult enough to be honest in general life, let alone when "making a pass". Sandra &amp; Andres also recorded the song in English (as "What Do I Do?"), German ("Was soll ich tun?") and French ("C'est pour demain").

The song was performed eighteenth on the night, following [[Luxembourg]]'s [[Vicky Leandros]] with "[[Après toi]]". By the close of voting, it had received 106 points, placing it 4th in a field of 18.

It was succeeded as [[Netherlands in the Eurovision Song Contest|Dutch representative]] at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1973]] by [[Ben Cramer]] with "[[De oude muzikant]]". Sandra Reemer returned to the Contest as a solo artist in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1976|1976]] with "[[The Party's Over (Sandra Reemer song)|The Party's Over]]" and again in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1979|1979]] with "[[Colorado (song)|Colorado]]", then as the front figure of the band Xandra.

The AFN worldwide radio and television broadcast network serves American servicemembers, Department of Defense and other U.S. government civilians and their families stationed at bases overseas, as well as U.S. Navy ships at sea. AFN broadcasts popular American radio and television programs from the major U.S. networks. It is sometimes referred to as the Armed Forces Network. AFRTS, American Forces Network and AFN are registered trademarks of the U.S. Department of Defense. It is based at [[Fort George G. Meade]] in [[Maryland]] and is part of the [[Defense Media Activity]].

==Organization==
The American Forces Network (AFN) is the operational arm of the American Forces Radio and Television Service (AFRTS), an office of the [[Defense Media Activity]] (DMA). AFN falls under the operational control of the Office of the [[Assistant Secretary of Defense]] for [[Public affairs (military)|Public Affairs]] (OASD-PA). Editorial control is by the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]], whereas the [[British Forces Broadcasting Service|British Forces Broadcasting Service (BFBS)]], for example, is independent of the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] and the British armed forces.

AFN employs military broadcasters as well as Department of Defense civilians and contractors. Service personnel hold broadcasting [[military occupational specialty|occupational specialties]] for their military branch.

Since 1997, all of AFN's military personnel receive primary training at the [[Defense Information School]] (DINFOS) at [[Fort George G. Meade]] in [[Maryland]]. Before 1997, DINFOS was located at [[Fort Benjamin Harrison]] in [[Indianapolis, Indiana|Indianapolis]], [[Indiana]]. In 1997, Fort Benjamin Harrison was largely closed as a function of the 1991 [[Base Closure and Realignment Commission]]. Additional/Advanced training is also available at Fort George G. Meade.

In the 1960s, DINFOS was located at Fort Slocum, NY on a small island just off the harbor at New Rochelle. At its peak in 1965, the Army Chaplain school was also located here. In 1963 this campus operated in a "university" setting with a relaxed military environment. The Army ran the Information School although training was offered to members of all military branches. Radio types took a rather severe audition written by CBS for their network announcers. Those who survived the audition became "Broadcast Specialists" with a 703 MOS and went on to an AFRTS assignment.

Some of AFN's broadcasters have previous [[commercial broadcasting]] experience before enlisting in the military, but it is not a prerequisite for enlistment in the military as a broadcaster. During their training, the broadcasters are taught to use state-of-the-art audio and visual editing equipment similar to their civilian counterparts.

AFN management is located at DMA headquarters at Fort Meade. Day-to-day AFN broadcast operations are conducted at the AFN Broadcast Center/Defense Media Center in [[Riverside, California|Riverside]], California, from where all global radio and television satellite feeds emanate.

==History==
The American Forces Network can trace its origins to May 26, 1942, when the [[United States Department of War|War Department]] established the Armed Forces Radio Service (AFRS).&lt;ref name="afrts.dodmedia.osd.mil"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://afrts.dodmedia.osd.mil/facts/1.pdf |title=Historical Summary: American Forces Radio and Television Service (AFRTS) |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=March 14, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120220153149/http://afrts.dodmedia.osd.mil/facts/1.pdf |archivedate=February 20, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A television service was first introduced in 1954 with a pilot station at [[Loring Air Force Base|Limestone Air Force Base]], [[Maine]]. In 1954, the television mission of AFRS was officially recognized and AFRS (Armed Forces Radio Service) became AFRTS (Armed Forces Radio and Television Service).&lt;ref name="afrts.dodmedia.osd.mil"/&gt; All of the Armed Forces broadcasting affiliates worldwide merged under the AFN banner on January 1, 1998. On November 21, 2000, the American Forces Information Service directed a change of the AFRTS organizational title from Armed Forces Radio and Television Service back to American Forces Radio and Television Service. A timeline of the history of AFN is available online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://afrts.dodmedia.osd.mil/heritage/heritage.asp |title=AFRTS |publisher=Afrts.dodmedia.osd.mil |date= |accessdate=December 31, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091215134713/http://afrts.dodmedia.osd.mil/heritage/heritage.asp |archivedate=December 15, 2009 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Origins===
KODK began broadcasting from the U.S. Army base [[Coast Guard Base Kodiak|Fort Greely]] at [[Kodiak, Alaska|Kodiak]], [[Alaska]], before the inception of the AFRS. Fort Greeley was built to defend and was an integral part of the Kodiak Naval Air Station, sometimes called Naval Operating Base. Construction of both was under way in 1940. The naval station and AFRS radio remained in operation, but Fort Greely closed at the end of World War II. Years later the name Fort Greely was resurrected for the Big Delta (near Delta Junction) Army base. The small town of Kodiak, located six miles away, had no radio station, while Anchorage and Fairbanks, where Army and Army Air Force bases soon would be established, had civilian radio stations. Thus KODK had a primary role to bring radio to the armed forces and civilians in the Kodiak area.  The sign-off at KODK was the memorable "Goodnight, Sweetheart" set to a stirring melody from Liszt's Les Preludes. The station lived on to bring the first television to Kodiak.

The first radio station began in [[Delta Junction, Alaska]], on what was then known as Fort Greely. It was called KODK and was operated by on base personnel. In the years just before World War II, there were several radio stations based in American [[military base]]s, but none were officially recognized until 1942. The success of these individual radio stations helped pave the way for the AFN. As such, there was no single station that could be called the "first" to sign on as an AFN station. About two months before formal establishment of AFN, however, a station called "PCAN" began regular broadcast information service in the [[Panama Canal Zone]], primarily for troops on jungle [[bivouac shelter|bivouac]]. The station, located at [[Fort Clayton]], was later to become part of AFRS, first simply as "Armed Forces Network" located at [[Albrook Air Force Base|Albrook Field]].

The U.S. Army began broadcasting from London during World War II, using equipment and studio facilities borrowed from the [[British Broadcasting Corporation]] (BBC).

The first transmission to U.S. troops began at 5:45&amp;nbsp;p.m. July 4, 1943, and included less than five hours of recorded shows, a [[BBC news]] and sports broadcast.  That day, [[Corporal]] [[Syl Binkin]] became the first U.S. military broadcaster heard over the air. The signal was sent from London via telephone lines to five regional [[transmitter]]s to reach U.S. troops in the United Kingdom as they made preparations for the [[Operation Overlord|invasion]] of [[Nazi-occupied Europe]].

Fearing competition for civilian audiences, the BBC initially tried to impose restrictions on AFN broadcasts within Britain (transmissions were allowed only from American Bases outside London and were limited to 50 watts of transmission power) and a minimum quota of British produced programming had to be carried. Nevertheless, AFN programs were widely enjoyed by the British civilian listeners who could receive them, and once AFN operations transferred to continental Europe (shortly after D-Day) AFN was able to broadcast with little restriction with programs available to civilian audiences across most of Europe, (including Britain), after dark.

As [[Normandy landings|D-Day]] approached, the network joined with the BBC and the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] to develop programs especially for the [[Allied Expeditionary Forces]]. Mobile stations, complete with personnel, broadcasting equipment and a record library, were deployed to broadcast music and news to troops in the field. The mobile stations reported on front-line activities and fed the news reports back to studio locations in London.

Although the network's administrative headquarters remained in London, its operational headquarters soon moved to AFN Paris.

As Allied forces continued to push German troops back into their homeland, AFN moved east as well. The liberation of most of Western Europe saw AFN stations serving the forces liberating [[Biarritz]], [[Cannes]], [[Le Havre]], [[Marseille]], [[Nice]], Paris and [[Reims]].

During the period between 1943 and 1949 the AFN also broadcast programs developed through a collaboration of the [[Department of State]]'s [[Office of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs]] and the [[Columbia Broadcasting System|CBS]] network while supporting America's [[cultural diplomacy]] initiatives. Included among the programs was ''[[Viva America]]'' which showcased leading musical talents from both North and South America and was transmitted for the benefit of armed forces throughout Europe and to South America over CBS's short wave network "La Cadena de Las Americas".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=L3WyZ9A4_XEC&amp;pg=PA198&amp;dq=Seventh+Army+Symphony+Orchestra&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjGr83up4bdAhUGy1kKHTBxDZMQ6AEIMTAC#v=onepage&amp;q=VIva%20America&amp;f=false ''The Directory of the Armed Forces Radio Service Series'' Mackenzie, Harry.

===Post-war contraction and expansion===
[[File:Lionel Barrymore.gif|thumb|[[Lionel Barrymore]] broadcasting the Armed Forces Radio Service's ''Concert Hall'' radio show (1947)]]
On July 10, 1945, the first AFN station in occupied Germany started broadcasting, the [[AFN Munich]]. Its first broadcast was however incorrect as it began with the sentence "Good morning! This is AFN Munich, the voice of the 7th Army!". General [[George S. Patton]], commander of the 3rd Army, was furious with the opening as his army had taken control over [[Munich]] the previous night, and demanded that the responsible person be [[court-martial]]ed.&lt;ref name="Compre" &gt;{{cite web |url= http://german.about.com/library/listening/bllisten-sil-AFNTransl.htm |title=German Listening: Amerikanischer Soldatensender AFN |work=about.com |year=2015 |accessdate=June 22, 2015 |language=German, English}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Book" &gt;{{cite book |last=Graeber |first=Stephanie |title=Der amerikanische Einfluss auf die Rolle des Radios in Nachkriegsbayern |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uvnSZ1VCWRUC&amp;pg=PA73 |accessdate=June 22, 2015 |year=2010 |publisher=GRIN Verlag |isbn=978-3-640-59161-9 |page=73 |language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after AFN Munich signed on the air in the southern part of occupied Germany, in northern Germany, AFN Bremen begin broadcasting a few weeks later with its first radio broadcast occurring on Saturday, July 28, 1945. (In 1949, the station moved from the city of Bremen north to the port city of Bremerhaven and became [[AFN Bremerhaven]].)

On December 31, 1945, AFN London signed off the air, and in 1948 AFN closed all its stations in France. This started the cycle of AFN stations where they would be built up during wartime, then torn down or moved after the war was over. Of the 300 stations in operation worldwide in 1945, only 60 remained in 1949.

===Post-War Europe===
A large number of AFN stations continued broadcasting from American bases in Europe, (particularly Germany) after World War II. (Eight remain on the air today. See article on [[:de:American Forces Network#Frequenzen in Deutschland und Benelux AFN Europe Frequencies|German Wikipedia]].)

During the [[Berlin Blockade]] of 1948–1949, planes headed for [[Tempelhof]] in West Berlin tuned their radios to AFN-Berlin because the station's transmission tower was in the glidepath to the airfield and was not jammed by the Soviets.

During the 1950s and 1960s, civilian audiences in Europe widely listened to AFN, as American music was very popular but rarely played on most European broadcasting stations, which at the time were generally state-operated. This was particularly the case in [[Communist bloc]] countries, where, despite the language barrier, it was seen as an alternative way of maintaining contact with the west, and had the added bonus of not being subjected to [[radio jamming]], unlike stations such as [[Radio Free Europe]], which carried news in Eastern European languages.

Especially popular was ''Music in the Air'', which aired on the full European network at 19:00 CET. The host was the AFN-Frankfurt (civilian) manager John Vrotsos, who had an especially warm baritone voice and began each program after an introductory piano phrase from the theme, "Listen ... [pause for more piano] ... there's music in the air". The theme was "Music Everywhere" in an arrangement by [[Victor Young]]. Also popular were live performances of classical music and jazz by [[Samuel Adler (composer)|Samuel Hans Adler]]'s [[Seventh Army Symphony Orchestra]] in support of America's [[cultural diplomacy]] initiatives in the post war period.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=L3WyZ9A4_XEC&amp;pg=PA198&amp;dq=Seventh+Army+Symphony+Orchestra&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjGr83up4bdAhUGy1kKHTBxDZMQ6AEIMTAC#v=onepage&amp;q=Seventh%20Army%20Symphony%20Orchestra&amp;f=false ''The Directory of the Armed Forces Radio Service Series''] Harry MacKenzie, Greeenwood Press, CT. 1999, p. 198 {{ISBN|0-313-30812-8}} "Seventh Army Symphony on Armed Forces Radio in 1961 performing works by Vivaldi and Dvorak" on http://books.google.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=RzxEAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=Seventh+Army+Symphony+Orchestra&amp;dq=Seventh+Army+Symphony+Orchestra&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwitq-bq6YvdAhVrpVkKHevzB3gQ6AEISzAH ''Seventh Army Symphony Orchestra''] on http://books.google.com&lt;/ref&gt;

In France, about a dozen AFN stations operated, with AFN Orléans, as the studio control station. The network broadcast music, shows, and news relayed from AFN Frankfurt, locally produced shows and other features aimed at the American soldiers and their families stationed in France. In particular, a whole team of reporters and technicians was sent to [[Le Mans]], [[France]], to report the 24-hour auto race, at a time when Ford was doing its best to beat the Ferraris, and finally succeeded. AFN France broadcast in 50-watts, frequency modulated transmitters purchased from a French manufacturer (TRT), type OZ 305. The network employed a technical director, a program director, several military American broadcast professionals, and some French studio operators, record librarians, secretaries and maintenance technicians. The Frankfurt network programming was received, then re-fed from AFN Orléans studios to another studio-equipped affiliate, AFN Poitiers, and its slave transmitters via modulation lines rented from the French postmaster department. AFN Poitiers, based at Aboville Caserne, Poitiers, France, home of an Army logistical command and a major Communication Zone Signal Corps agency, served Army depots and installations in Southwestern France with locally originated programs and network feeds from AFN Orlean via Frankfurt, Germany. It was the only other studio station affiliate of AFN Orleans because of the large American military presence and it's resident Department of Defense dorm school for children of American military and civilian families assigned to Poitiers, and the American installations located throughout Southwestern France. Children living in outlying American military installations and communities commuted to Poitiers once a week for daily classes and departed for home by bus and train. AFN France was dismantled in 1967, when U.S. forces left France due to the French government's decision of President (General) Charles de Gaulle to withdraw its forces from [[NATO]]'s military command. The French employees were dismissed but were granted a severance pay (in [[French franc]]s and taxable) of one month per year of service, paid by the U.S. Army to the French government, in dollars (all the French employees were managed by a specially created service: le Bureau d'Aide aux Armées Alliées AAA).{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

===Korean War===
When war broke out in [[Korea]], Army broadcasters set up in [[Seoul]] in the Banto Hotel (the old American Embassy Hotel). When the Chinese entered Seoul in December 1950, the crew moved to a mobile unit that was just completed and retreated to [[Daegu, South Korea|Daegu]]. Due to the large number of American troops in Korea, a number of stations were started. Mobile units followed combat units to provide news and entertainment on the radio. By the time the 1953 armistice was signed, these mobile units became buildings with transmitters, and a network, American Forces Korea Network, was born.

Canadian and American television personality [[Jim Perry (television personality)|Jim Perry]] began his broadcasting career fresh out of high school with the Armed Forces Korea Network, under his birthname of Jim Dooley, spending one year in Korea before attending the [[University of Pennsylvania]] to further his education.

===Iran===
An AFRTS radio station became operational in [[Tehran]], [[Pahlavi dynasty|Iran]] in 1959.&lt;ref name="Factbook"/&gt; This was followed by a television station in 1960,&lt;ref name="Naficy"&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=CPtUfi3K_JYC&amp;lpg=PA46&amp;dq=afrts%20iran&amp;pg=PA46#v=onepage&amp;q=afrts%20iran&amp;f=false ''A Social History of Iranian Cinema, Volume 2: The Industrializing Years, 1941–1978''], Hamid Naficy, Duke University Press, 2011, page 46&lt;/ref&gt; known as AFTV.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=PjFKAQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=%22AFTV%22+%22Iran%22&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=%22Persian%22 ''Journal of the Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers''], Volume 77, SMPTE, 1968, page 512&lt;/ref&gt; It broadcast a radio service on 1555 kHz and a television service on Channel 7 in Tehran and the surrounding area from its studios in the city.&lt;ref name="CommDev"&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=mg1RAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22NIRT+International%22&amp;dq=%22NIRT+International%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwimk9fKjsbeAhXJJsAKHRK5CK0Q6AEIKjAA ''Communications and Development Review''], Volume 1, Issues 1-4, Iran Communications and Development Institute, 1977&lt;/ref&gt;

Its listeners (and viewers) were American military personnel stationed in Iran as part of [[ARMISH]] (the [[US Army]] mission) and [[MAAG|Military Assistance Advisory Group (MAAG)]] programs.&lt;ref name="Factbook"&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=XkIqAQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=%22AFRTS%22+%22ARMISH%22&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=%22ARMISH%22 ''Television Factbook''], Issues 39-40, Television Digest, inc., 1969&lt;/ref&gt; AFTV was also popular with Iranian viewers, particularly children.&lt;ref name="Cam"&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=H20Xt157iYUC&amp;lpg=PA811&amp;dq=%22Television%20Iran%22%20%22dubbed%22&amp;pg=PA811#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Television%20Iran%22%20%22dubbed%22&amp;f=false ''The Cambridge History of Iran''], Volume 7, Cambridge University Press, 1989, pages 810-811&lt;/ref&gt;

As the TV service only had a power of 1000 watts, it was only on air for a few hours each day, whereas the radio service operated for around 18 hours a day.&lt;ref name="Almanac1974"&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=FAggAQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=%22American+community%22+%22Tehran%22+%22radio%22&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=%22American+Community%22 ''Iran Almanac and Book of Facts''], Echo of Iran, 1974, page 129&lt;/ref&gt; In deference to Iranian sensitivities, AFRTS avoided carrying programming that might be construed as offensive on political or religious grounds, instead carrying cowboy or detective movies.&lt;ref name="Zonis"&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=AG99BgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA247&amp;dq=%22AFRTS%22%20%22Iran%22&amp;pg=PA247#v=onepage&amp;q=%22AFRTS%22%20&amp;f=false ''Political Elite of Iran''], Marvin Zonis, Princeton University Press, 1976, page 247&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the nationalization of the privately owned [[Television in Iran#Television Iran|Television Iran]] network in 1969, AFTV was the only television service not in the Iranian government's hands.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=lgA0AQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=%22AFTV%22+%22Iran%22&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=%22AFTV%22++ ''Iran 69: An Independent Survey of the Iranian Economy''], 1969, page 88&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 1976, it was decided by the Iranian government that AFRTS should close down its radio and TV services, which it did on October 25 of that year, the day before the [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi|Shah]]'s 57th birthday.&lt;ref name="Almanac"&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=9ybVAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=%22NIRT%22+%22International%22+%22Iran%22&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=%22NIRT%27s+new+international+services%22 ''Iran Almanac and Book of Facts''], Volume 16, Echo of Iran., 1977, page 125&lt;/ref&gt;

Radio 1555 closed with presenter Air Force Staff Sergeant Barry Cantor playing [[Roger Whittaker]]'s "[[Durham Town (The Leavin')]]". This was followed by a closing announcement by Chief Master Sergeant and Station Manager Bob Woodruff, ending with the [[The Star-Spangled Banner|U.S. national anthem]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Ladies and Gentlemen, I'm Chief Master Sargent Bob Woodruff Station Manager of the American Forces Radio and Television Service in [[Tehran]]. After 22 years of radio broadcasting and 17 years of telecasting in Tehran, AFRTS Radio 1555 and TV Channel 7 cease all operations in this country at this time. I give you all goodbye and thank you for letting us serve you. And now the national anthem of the United States of America."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Jonny|title=American Forces Network Radio (1950-2012)|date=2017-10-21|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD-4sJIsK5M&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=222|accessdate=2017-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Bahram9821|title=NIRT International Radio|date=2012-02-11|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4Rvgr14sng&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=15|accessdate=2017-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|R4Rvgr14sng|Iran "NIRT International Radio"}}, 11 February 2012&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The following day, AFRTS radio and television services in Iran were replaced by those operated by the state broadcaster [[National Iranian Radio and Television]] (NIRT), which were similar in content,  appealing to the 60 000 [[US Army]] and civilian personnel then stationed in Iran, as well as the wider population of foreign nationals resident in the country.&lt;ref name="Intermedia89"&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=aiO4AAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=%22Reza+Ghotbi%22+%22NIRT%22+%221971%22&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=%22NIRT%27s+budget%22 ''Intermedia''], Volume 17, International Institute of Communications, 1989, page 37&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vietnam===
As the American military presence in [[Vietnam]] increased, AFRTS opened radio and later television stations there.&lt;ref name="geocities.com"&gt;{{cite web |title=AFVN - American Forces Vietnam Network |url=http://www.geocities.com/afvn |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5knHIhPoV?url=http://www.geocities.com/afvn |archivedate=October 25, 2009 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

AFRTS stations in Vietnam were initially known by the name "AFRS" (Armed Forces Radio Saigon), but as the number of stations quickly expanded throughout [[Republic of Vietnam|South Vietnam]] became known as "AFVN" (American Forces Vietnam Network)&lt;ref name="geocities.com"/&gt; and had several stations, including [[Qui Nhơn]], [[Nha Trang]], [[Pleiku]], [[Da Nang]] and [[Huế]], the latter being overrun by the NVA in 1968 and replaced by a station in [[Quảng Trị]]. AFVN's headquarters station was located in [[Saigon]].

In Vietnam, AFVN had a number of war-related casualties. After a fierce fire fight that killed two soldiers and a civilian contractor, the remaining AFVN station staff at Huế was captured and spent five years as prisoners of war. At the height of American involvement in the war, Armed Forces Vietnam Network served more than 500,000 fighting men and women at one time. AFVN developed a program along the lines of "[[GI Jive]]" from World War II. A number of local [[disc jockey]]s helped make hourlong music programs for broadcast. Perhaps the best-known program became the morning "Dawn Buster" program, (the brainchild of Chief Petty Officer Bryant Arbuckle in 1962) thanks to the popularity of the sign-on slogan "Gooooood Morning, Vietnam" (which was initiated by [[Adrian Cronauer]] and later became the basis for the film ''[[Good Morning, Vietnam]]'' starring [[Robin Williams]]). Among the notable people who were AFVN disc jockeys were Don L. "Scotty" Brink,  [[Lee Hansen (radio)|Lee Hansen]], Les Coleman and [[Pat Sajak]] and Denny Woytek. Harry Simons hosted the ''GO Show'' at both AFVN Saigon and Danang in 1968 and 1969. Simons along with broadcaster Mike Bates created and produced a 10-hour radio documentary (''AFVN: The GI's Companion'') as a tribute to AFVN and to honor all Vietnam Veterans. It aired and streamed on Veterans Day 2015 on WEBY Radio in Pensacola, Florida.  The documentary is archived at http://RockRadioScrapbook.ca/afvn.html

Beginning in 1971, AFVN began to close some stations in Vietnam. The last station to close was the key station in [[Saigon]] in 1973. Broadcasting continued under civilian leadership on FM only and using the name American Radio Service (ARS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Engelmann |first=Larry |title=Tears before the Rain: An Oral History of the Fall of South Vietnam |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zXiJy6aAr2oC&amp;pg=PT372 |accessdate=June 22, 2015 |date=August 30, 1990 |publisher=Oxford University Press, USA |isbn=978-0-19-987892-5 |page=372}}&lt;/ref&gt; The civilian engineers were provided by Pacific Architects and Engineers (PAE). ARS stayed on the air until the [[Fall of Saigon]] in April 1975. It was to play [[Bing Crosby]]'s version of [[Irving Berlin]]'s "[[White Christmas (song)|White Christmas]]" as a signal for Americans that the [[Operation Frequent Wind|final evacuation of Saigon]] had begun. The Crosby version of the record could not be found so Tennessee Ernie Ford's record was played.

===Thailand===
In [[Thailand]], the Department of Defense began the planning for the Armed Forces Thailand Network in 1964 with Project Lamplighter and Project Limelight. By late 1966, implementation of the network began by the U.S. Air Force with stations on the air at Korat, U-Tapao, [[Ubon]], Udon, Tahkli and Nahkon Phanom (NKP). In addition, there were more than 20 satellite stations that rebroadcast one or more of the primary stations, and that included one or more clandestine locations in [[Laos]].

In April 1970, a battle-damaged [[F-4 Phantom II]] fighter-bomber, returning from a reconnaissance mission to survey a road being built by the Chinese toward [[Burma]] in northwest Laos, crashed into the AFTN station, killing nine of the Air Force broadcasters. This incident was the single worst catastrophe in the history of military broadcasting.

AFTN became the American Forces Thailand Network in the summer of 1969, and continued operations until the spring of 1976 when the remaining U.S. troops in Thailand were withdrawn at the request of the Thai government. More than 600 broadcasters from the Air Force, Navy and Army had served during the ten years that AFTN operated.

The history of AFTN can be found at this website&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.aftn.net/ |title=AFTN-The American Forces Thailand Network |work=aftn.net |year=2015 |accessdate=June 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with a memorial to the nine broadcasters who gave their lives in the service of their country.

===Taiwan===
{{see also|International Community Radio Taipei|l1=ICRT}}
Before 1979, the AFN branch in [[Taiwan]] was Armed Forces Network Taiwan (AFNT), which had a main station in [[Yangmingshan American Military Housing]], [[Taipei]]. After the [[U.S. armed forces]] withdrew all its troops stationed in Taiwan (including the [[United States Taiwan Defense Command]]), the station was reorganized under the name of [[International Community Radio Taipei]] (ICRT) by the [[American Chamber of Commerce in Taipei]] and the [[ROC government]]. Today, ICRT is the only [[English-language radio]] service in Taiwan.

===Caribbean===

Then still known as the Armed Forces Radio and Television Service, military bases and facilities throughout Puerto Rico received radio programming from Army studios at Ft. Brooke in San Juan, as well as their local playback of Stateside entertainment radio shows.  This radio service, known as AFCN...the Armed Forces Caribbean Network, served military bases and facilities throughout Puerto Rico from  transmitters in San Juan (Fort Brooke, Fort Buchanan), Roosevelt Roads, and Ramey Air Force Base.  Each of these bases also had their own television transmitters or cable systems which played back stateside TV programming delivered to each location in weekly "packages" of 16mm film and kinescope recordings.

===Central America===
Radio, and later television, to U.S. troops stationed in the [[Panama Canal Zone]] was provided initially by Armed Forces Radio (AFN) at [[Albrook Field]] and later as the [[Caribbean Forces Network]] at [[Fort Clayton]] with translators on the Atlantic side of the Canal Zone. In the early 1960s with reorganization of the command located in the Canal Zone, CFN became the Southern Command Network (SCN). SCN also broadcast to U.S. troops stationed in [[Honduras]] starting in 1987. SCN discontinued broadcasting in 1999 just before the turnover of the Canal Zone to the [[Republic of Panama]] when U.S. troops were removed from that country under the [[Torrijos-Carter Treaties]].

AFN [[Honduras]], which began in 1987 as SCN Honduras, now broadcasts from [[Soto Cano Air Base]] on 106.5 FM, and serves more than 600 American service members stationed at the installation, as well as numerous civilian employees and contractors. The station's primary mission is radio, originating programming including two daily live shows following the "Eagle" format. Personnel also occasionally produce video news packages. As of January 15, 2013, AFN Honduras is one of 18 stations under the operational control of AFN Europe.

===Shortwave radio===
With the advent of [[satellite broadcasting]], AFRTS has shifted its emphasis away from [[Shortwave radio|shortwave]].  Currently, the U.S. Navy provides the only shortwave [[single sideband]] [[shortwave]] AFN radio broadcasts via relay sites around the world to provide service to ships, including [[Diego Garcia]], [[Guam]], [[Naval Air Station Sigonella]] in Italy, [[Puerto Rico]], [[Hawaii]] and others.

==Television services==

===European operations===
Until the early 1970s, U.S. military television service was provided in [[Central Europe]] by [[United States Air Force|Air Force]] Television at [[Ramstein Air Base]], Germany. In the early 1970s, AFN assumed this responsibility for the Armed Forces Radio and Television Service (AFRTS).

[[AFN Bremerhaven]] was the first AFN television station in Europe to broadcast its programming in color. The U.S. European Edition of "Stars and Stripes" (S&amp;S) reported in its Thursday, August 21, 1975 edition that the AFN-Europe Commander, Lt. Col. Floyd A. McBride, announced that AFN's first color TV broadcast would begin in Bremerhaven on Monday August 25, 1975.  As S&amp;S reported, because Bremerhaven's TV operation was so small, only a "Class C" operation, and, at the time, served only one area with TV programming, it was easy to establish the color TV broadcast operation without extensive expense or expansion.&lt;ref name="stripes.com"&gt;Stars and Stripes (European Edition Archives) http://www.stripes.com/customer-service/archives&lt;/ref&gt;

That next year, S&amp;S reported in its Wednesday, June 23, 1976 edition, that "the long-awaited switch to color by AFN-TV could come by the end of the year for viewers in most of West Germany.  The only viewers enjoying color right now are those watching the pilot color TV station in [[Bremerhaven]], which went on the air in…1975".&lt;ref name="stripes.com"/&gt;

Finally, on October 28, 1976, AFN television moved from AFTV's old black-and-white studios at Ramstein to the network's new color television studios in Frankfurt. In the 1980s the network added affiliates with studio capabilities in [[Würzburg]], Germany, and [[Soesterberg]], the Netherlands, expanding the network to 12 affiliate stations serving American military, DOD-employed civilians and their families estimated to be well-above 350,000 stationed in West Germany, the Netherlands, and Belgium.  This was accomplished by a system of 112 microwave transmitters operated and maintained by the Army's 5th Signal Command.  Embassies and other entities of the American government without access to AFN TV signals received a 30-plus hour package mailed weekly of AFN and U.S. programming.  In April, 1984 AFN began broadcasting live news, information and entertainment programming received through a 9-meter satellite dish downlink at AFN network headquarters, in addition to primetime pre-recorded shows and movies received from the Armed Forces Radio-Television Service broadcast center in Hollywood.  For outlying areas, broadcast feeds of live American sports events were frequently provided by European contractors.

AFN TV was available in [[West Berlin]] via  [[cable television|cable]] until 1994.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?ei=V88eVfagItb7apaQgtAO&amp;id=w5kjAQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=ssvc+berlin+zitty&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=AFN-TV ''Zitty''], Volume 18, Issues 23-25, Zitty Verlag GmbH, 1994&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was only available in the [[History of Berlin#West and East Germany (1945–1990)|American Sector]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=hgwcAQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=franz%C3%B6sischen++in+Berlin+radio+%22FFB%22&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=+%22SSVC%22 ''Medienlandschaft im Umbruch: Medien- und Kommunikationsatlas Berlin''], Günter Bentele, Otfried Jarren, Ulrich Kratzsch, Vistas Verlag, 1990, page 260&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, AFN Europe headquarters relocated to [[Coleman Army Airfield|Coleman Barracks]] in [[Mannheim]], Germany.

In 2014, AFN Europe headquarters relocated to [[Sembach Kaserne]] in [[Sembach]], Germany.

===Pacific operations===
Over-the-air TV for U.S. Forces in the Pacific is currently provided by AFN-Korea, AFN-Japan and AFN-Kwajalein. All local operations merged under the AFN banner effective January 1, 1998.

====Korea====
AFN-Korea, formerly American Forces Korea Network (AFKN), was the largest of AFN's Pacific TV operations, although there are also AM and FM operations from military bases around Korea. AFKN began TV operations on September 15, 1957, and consisted of an originating studio at [[Yongsan Garrison]], Seoul, and six relay transmitters throughout the peninsula. AFKN's first live television newscast aired on January 4, 1959. Until December 2007, the channel was widely available to non-military audiences on [[cable television]], but following complaints from U.S. companies trying to sell programs in [[South Korea]], USFK requested that the [[Korean Broadcasting Commission]] direct the removal of Pacific Prime from the Korean cable lineups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stripes.com/news/korean-cable-firms-to-stop-afn-broadcasts-1.70882 |title=Korean cable firms to stop AFN broadcasts |publisher=[[Stars and Stripes (newspaper)|Stripes.com]] |date=November 7, 2007 |accessdate=December 31, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; American Forces Network-Korea discontinued analog over-the-air TV broadcast May 1, 2012, due to request from the Korean government because many local residents could receive current over-the-air U.S. network programming, resulting in decreased sales of U.S. programs to Korean stations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afnkorea.net/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=MNmAXjYs0AA%3d AFN to discontinue over-the-air television broadcast in Korea ]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141213035803/http://www.afnkorea.net/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=MNmAXjYs0AA%3D |date=December 13, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Japan====
AFN-Japan, formerly the [[Far East Network]] (FEN), had one full-power [[VHF]] terrestrial TV outlet—located on [[Okinawa]] atop the Rycom Plaza Housing area in the central part of the island, AFN-Okinawa's ([[NTSC System|U.S. channel 8]]) TV signal served [[United States Marine Corps|Marines]], [[United States Air Force|Airmen]], [[United States Navy|Sailors]], [[United States Army|Soldiers]], and their families stationed on-island. TV viewers on military bases in the Tokyo and Kanto Plain area of Japan can view AFN via contractor-operated base [[cable TV]] services, or through AFN Direct-To-Home (DTH) dish services if they reside off-base.

AFN-Japan's radio services consist of AM and FM stereo operations at [[Yokota Air Base]] (810 AM &amp; cable FM), MCAS Iwakuni (1575 AM), FLTACTS Sasebo (1575 AM), Okinawa (648 AM &amp; 89.1 FM) and Misawa Air Base (1575 AM).

AFN-Okinawa ceased over-the-air analog TV operations in 2011.

====Latin America====
AFN-Latin America, formerly the Las CableVision (LCV), has one full-power [[VHF]] terrestrial TV outlet. Located on [[HDTV]].

====Kwajalein Atoll====
AFN-Kwajalein at the Reagan Missile Test Range on [[Kwajalein Atoll]] is the only civilian-run affiliate in AFN, broadcasting on U.S. channel 13 for military personnel and civilian contractor employees and their families. AFN-Kwajalein's signal is beamed by microwave to the nearby island of [[Roi-Namur]] and rebroadcast on channel 8.

With the availability of AFN's DTH service, terrestrial over-the-air TV broadcasts at all AFN outlets are slated for deactivation in the near future.

===Gulf War===
In January 1991, the network dispatched news teams and technicians to [[Kuwait]] and [[Saudi Arabia]] for Operations [[Operation Desert Shield (Gulf War)|Desert Shield]] and [[Desert Storm]]. These broadcasters reported to families of soldiers deployed from Europe and staffed a number of the U.S. radio stations making up the Armed Forces Desert Network. The first song on the air after the start of the ground offensive was "[[Rock the Casbah]]" by [[The Clash]].

===Operation Iraqi Freedom===
[[File:AFNBaghdad.jpg|thumb|right|248px|AFN Iraq on-air radio studio. Baghdad, Iraq (April 2004).]]
AFN-Iraq began broadcasting in December 2003 on the [[FM band]] shortly after the fall of [[Saddam]]. The first song on the air was ''Freedom'' by [[Paul McCartney]]. Within a short time, Freedom Radio was broadcasting on multiple FM channels from as far south as Basra to as far north as Mosul.

AFN-Iraq, Freedom Radio began as a joint effort between the Air Force, the Marines and the Army. The first unit to operate the station was the [[222nd Broadcast Operations Detachment (BOD)|222nd Broadcast Operations Detachment]], an Army Reserve unit based in southern California. ''"Always There and On The Air"'' was the phrase that started it all, even though there were only eight hours of live radio to kick things off.

After an introduction from [[Lieutenant General (United States)|Lt. Gen.]] [[Ricardo Sanchez]], the commander of Coalition Ground Forces in Iraq, Air Force Master Sergeant Erik Brazones was the first DJ on the air. When the 222nd BOD took the reins of the radio operations, the first two regular radio shows were "Niki Cage in the Morning" and "Abbey in the Afternoon".
AFN-Iraq signed off in 2011.

===Operation Enduring Freedom===
AFN Afghanistan operates out of a building on [[Bagram Air Base]]. Its radio frequency throughout Afghanistan is 94.1 and 97.1 in Manas and produces live local shows. Its first radio transmission was at 06 o'clock 30 min on Friday, July 21, 2006. Beyond radio, AFN Afghanistan also does television news. It produces a daily five-minute newscast called Freedom Watch Afghanistan and airs on the [[Pentagon Channel]].

The station is typically staffed with Air Force broadcasters but also slots Army, Navy and Marine broadcasters as well. For support there is usually a four-man team of engineers to handle all transmission, decoder and satellite issues.

===Operations in Western Europe===
AFN in Germany and SEB (Southern European Broadcasting) in Italy provided broadcasting to U.S. troops in Western Europe throughout the [[Cold War]]. The U.S. defense drawdown began in earnest after the Gulf War, and affected AFN stations across Europe, as many stations were consolidated or deactivated with the closing of bases. In Europe, AFN is still on the air from [[Tuzla]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]], and [[Taszár]], [[Hungary]], to inform and entertain U.S. forces.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}

AFN went on the air May 29 &lt;!-- Which year? --&gt; with service at the [[Tirana]] airport in [[Albania]] with satellite decoders and large-screen televisions placed in high traffic areas. At the same time, the AFN also advanced into the Yugoslav province of [[Kosovo]] along with [[NATO]].

AFN viewers abroad witnessed live television coverage of the [[September 11, 2001 attacks|terrorist attacks]] on [[The Pentagon]] and [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]] on September 11, 2001.

During military operations in [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|Afghanistan]] and Iraq AFN provided non-stop coverage of the campaigns. AFN broadcast personnel from Europe deployed with the troops to cover events. Today AFN has a staffed affiliate in Iraq, AFN-[[Baghdad]] (launched in 2003).

Wherever large numbers of U.S. troops are deployed, the AFN sets up operation, providing news and entertainment from home. Today AFN has several satellites and uses advanced [[digital compression]] technology to broadcast TV and radio to 177 countries and territories, as well as on board U.S. Navy vessels.

==Media services==
There have been ongoing plans for transitioning AFN TV to [[High-definition television|HDTV]] with an estimated completion timeframe between 2015 and 2017. So far, AFN has added one HD channel, with more being planned. However, the conversion to HD is an expensive project, so timelines and actual transition of channels is highly dependent on availability of funds. With the additional Department of Defense budget cuts looming, this project could easily be required to slip. However, AFN is continuing to research more efficient delivery methods in hopes of continuing along the planned path.

AFN's television service is broadcast in standard North American [[NTSC]] format of 525 lines. All programming delivered by satellite is [[PowerVu]] [[encrypted]] [[Digital Video Broadcasting|DVB]]. While programming is provided to AFN by major American TV networks and program syndicators at little to no cost, for [[copyright]] and [[licensing]] reasons it is intended solely for U.S. forces personnel, authorized Department of Defense civilian employees, [[United States Department of State|State Department]] diplomatic personnel and their families overseas.

AFN-TV is available to authorized viewers by "[[Direct-To-Home]]" (DTH) service with set-top decoders purchased or leased through military exchanges (similar to a membership store), licensed/contracted commercial cable operators, purchased used from other military members (the cheapest option) or [[Terrestrial television|terrestrial signal]]. The advent of DTH service coincides with the phasing-out of AFN terrestrial TV broadcasts due to reclamation of frequencies by host nations.

AFN is considered a non-essential service, and programming ceases during [[government shutdowns in the United States|government shutdowns]]. Sports programming to which the AFN has already purchased rights continues to be carried, as the skeleton crew operating AFN for essential programming does not save any money by [[blackout (broadcasting)|blacking out]] the programs.

===AFN programming===
While the audience tunes into AFN to watch their favorite shows or listen to the latest stateside hits, entertainment is the "candy coating" used to attract the military viewer/listener. AFN's primary mission is to provide access for worldwide, regional and local command information (CI) spots, which air during commercial breaks in programming instead of commercial advertisements. These CI spots run the gamut from reminding service members to register to vote, promoting local command-sponsored recreation events and off-duty educational programs, providing health and wellness tips, and listing what's playing at local base movie theaters.

AFN also inserts [[public service announcements]] from the [[Ad Council]]. Some of the 35 overseas AFN affiliates have the capability to cover the "worldwide" CI spots placed by the AFN Broadcast Center in California with regional or locally produced CI spots (such as localized messages from senior leadership).

Many service members welcome this approach, while others find it troublesome, especially during the airing of the [[Super Bowl]].

The network is allowed to broadcast commercial movie promotion trailers provided by the Army &amp; Air Force Exchange Service ([[AAFES]]) and the Navy Motion Picture Service (NMPS) to promote the latest film releases in base theaters worldwide. Previously these were the only true "commercials" authorized for broadcast.

AFN Radio and TV schedules are available here.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://v3.myafn.dodmedia.osd.mil/ |title=myAFN Schedule |work=Defense Media Activity |year=2015 |accessdate=June 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Radio====
AFN also offers a variety of radio programming over its various frequencies throughout the world. Not only is there local programming (with military disc jockeys), but there is satellite programming, as well. Music programming spans [[classic rock]], [[rhythm and blues]], [[Jack FM]] and [[country music]]. [[Ryan Seacrest]]'s ''[[American Top 40]]'' ('''Hot AC'''), [[WoodSongs Old-Time Radio Hour]] ('''Today's Best Country'''), [https://web.archive.org/web/20121102204016/http://remixtop30countdown.com/  Hollywood Hamilton's Remix Top 30] ('''AFN Eagle'''), [[Casey Kasem]]'s [[American Top 40]] ('''Joe Radio''') and the ''[[American Country Countdown]]'' with [[Kix Brooks]] ('''Today's Best Country''') are broadcast weekly over AFN Radio. In addition to music, AFN broadcasts [[radio syndication|syndicated]] [[talk radio]] programs such as ''[[Car Talk]]'' ('''NPR'''), [[John Tesh]] ('''Hot AC'''), ''[[The Bob and Sheri Show]]'' ('''Joe Radio'''), ''[[Le Show]]'' ('''NPR'''), ''[[Kidd Kraddick in the Morning]]'' ('''Hot AC'''), ''[[Kim Komando]]'' ('''The Voice'''), ''[[The Rush Limbaugh Show]]'' ('''Power Talk'''), [[Delilah (radio host)|Delilah]] ('''Hot AC'''), ''The [[Motley Fool]] Radio Show'' ('''The Voice'''), ''[[A Prairie Home Companion]]'' ('''NPR'''), ''[[Doug Stephan]]'' ('''The Voice'''),''Titillating Sports with Rick Tittle'', ''[[Sports Overnight America]]'' ('''Fans'''), ''[http://mrdad.com/category/positiveparenting-afn/ Mr Dad: Positive Parenting]'' ('''The Voice'''), and other programs from a variety of sources. Weekly religious programming is offered to AFN stations via closed-circuit.

On December 5, 2005, liberal/progressive [[Ed Schultz]] and conservative talk show host [[Sean Hannity]] were added to the radio programs provided by the AFN Broadcast Center to its affiliate stations. Liberal [[Alan Colmes]] rounds out the political talk lineup on The Voice channel.

On April 24, 2006, AFN Europe launched AFN The Eagle, a virtually 24-hour-a-day radio service format initially modeled after "Jack FM" but most recently a "Hot AC" format. This replaced ZFM, which had more of a contemporary hit radio flavor. When the Eagle was launched, AFN Europe took control of what local DJs could play.

Altogether, AFN produces ten general-use streams for AFN stations to use. Of these, five are music-based, two are sports-based and three general news/talk channels, including The Voice, which features live play-by-play of American sports (it's also the one heard on shortwave, if the shortwave radio has [[Single sideband]] installed). How these stations use these formats is up to them. These formats are:

*'''Hot AC''' (mainstream hits and yesterday's favorites)
*'''Today's Best Country''' (country/western)
*'''Gravity''' (urban rhythmic)
*'''AFN Legacy - Deep Classic Rock Gems'''
*'''Joe Radio''' ('80s, '90s)
*'''The Voice''' (News, talk and information)
*'''AFN Clutch''' (sports programming from ESPN and [[Yahoo! Sports Radio]])
*'''AFN Fans''' (sports programming from [[FOX Sports Radio]] and [[Sports Byline USA]])
*'''Power Talk''' (liberal and conservative talk programming)
*'''NPR''' (public radio programs from [[NPR]] and others)
*'''Parenting''' (Positive Parenting)

====Television====
Like its radio counterpart, AFN TV tries to air programming from a variety of sources to replicate programming on a typical U.S. TV channel; sourcing from U.S. commercial networks (including PBS), and program syndicators at little to no cost since AFN does not air commercials and in that regard cannot profit from airing shows like stations in the United States can. In their place, AFN inserts public service announcements on various subjects; these can be civilian "agency spots" created by [[The Ad Council]], nationally recognized religious and public health charities, AFN's own "command information" spots produced by the AFRTS Radio-Television Production Office (RTPO) or announcements by a regional/local AFN affiliate. The most common PSAs shown deal with [[sexual harassment]], public health and safety, force protection/anti-terrorism, pride in service and messages to the troops.

AFN produces and broadcasts eight core satellite television channels in [[NTSC]] color. They are accessible to both military and foreign service personnel abroad. All eight feeds are accessible in core areas, including but not limited to European, Korean and Japanese posts. Much of the rest of the world is limited to a smaller but more widespread naval broadcast.

=====Channels=====
Unless specified, the first telecast of each channel targets the Japan/Korea region, then replayed several hours later for the Central European time zone.

*'''AFN Prime'''. Formerly AFN Atlantic and AFN Pacific. The standard AFN feed airs current [[sitcom]]s, [[drama]]s, syndicated [[court show]]s, [[talk show]]s, [[game show]]s and [[reality show]]s popular in the United States, with a time delay from 24 hours to six months or more behind the United States airdates. In addition, popular U.S. [[soap opera]]s such as ''[[General Hospital]]'' are aired by AFN on a one-week tape delay. This stream is divided into three feeds ('''AFN Prime Atlantic,''' '''AFN Prime Freedom''' (Middle East) and '''AFN Prime Pacific'''); the difference between the three is that they are time-shifted so that programs air at the same local time in each of the major regions served: Japan/Korea, Central Europe and Iraq. Many regional feeds (such as AFN-Europe and AFN-Korea) are based on AFN Prime and add local programming to it; thus, in a way, AFN Prime mimics the regular network TV concept.
*'''AFN Spectrum'''. AFN Spectrum started as more of a conservative culture-oriented channel with programming from cable networks and classic TV series. In a way, it mimicked the "superstation" concept from cablecasters [[TBS (U.S. TV channel)|TBS]] and [[WGN America]]. However, the Spectrum lineup currently contains more conventional programming, like ''[[American Idol]]'' and ''[[Ugly Betty]]'', as some of the public television and classic fare that made up Spectrum is being reduced but remain the primary constant on the channel.
*'''AFN News'''. AFN News is a rolling-news channel providing news from all major news outlets.  Newscasts, such as the ''[[NBC Nightly News]]'', ''[[Fox News]]'', ''[[ABC World News Tonight]]'' and ''[[CBS Evening News]]'', were all scheduled to air in the mornings so viewers could watch the headlines live, but now they air on a tape delay in the regular early evening slot, back to back.
*'''AFN Family/AFN Pulse'''. AFN Family is a general entertainment channel providing programming for children ages 2 to 17. Although the name of the channel suggests programming appropriate for all family members at any time, the channel more closely resembles [[Freeform (TV channel)|Freeform]] or [[Nickelodeon]], with programming targeted at specific age groups during the course of the day. Programming during after school from 3 p.m. local time to 1 a.m. local time targets pre-schoolers but "ages" as older children become available to watch in the late morning and day. By 1 a.m. local time, programming is targeted at older teens. In September 2013, AFN launched a split in Family, which was branded AFN Pulse. About half of the day's programming remains aimed at the 2-to-13 age group. During primetime hours, the channel becomes AFN Pulse, and showcases programming primarily aimed at the older teen demographic, though it remains suitable for family viewing.
*'''AFN Movie'''. AFN Movie is a channel showcasing movies as well as film-oriented programming.
*'''AFN Sports'''. AFN Sports is a rolling-sports channel, providing sports news and events, including [[ESPN]]'s ''[[SportsCenter]]'' and live and delayed broadcasts of the NFL, NBA, NASCAR, MLB, NHL, NCAA college football, men and women's NCAA college basketball, FIFA soccer and PGA Tour, as well as other highly rated team competitions.
*'''AFN Sports 2'''. Launched in February 2006, as AFN Xtra. It is AFN's exclusive home for [[Ultimate Fighting Championship|UFC]] and [[World Wrestling Entertainment|WWE]] programming, including all pay-per-view events, as well as motor sports, including NASCAR, NHRA, Motocross and other auto and motorcycle racing series. 
*'''AFN Sports HD.''' AFN Sports is also now available in digital high definition using the new Cisco D9865 receiver/decoder.

==Internet radio==
In November 2013, the American Forces Network launched Internet radio streams expanding the reach of the military network's radio programming overseas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=AFN Internet radio service goes global Tuesday |date=November 29, 2013 |publisher=Stars and Stripes |url=http://www.stripes.com/news/afn-internet-radio-service-goes-global-tuesday-1.255159}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3156">'''Ariel''' was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[satellite]] research programme conducted between the early 1960s and 1980s. Six [[satellite]]s were launched as part of the programme, starting with the first British satellite, [[Ariel 1]], which was launched on 26 April 1962, and concluding with the launch of [[Ariel 6]] on 2 June 1979. The first four were devoted to studying the ionosphere, the remaining two to X-ray astronomy and cosmic-ray studies.

The programme was conducted by the [[Science Research Council]]. The first two spacecraft were constructed by the [[United States]] [[NASA|National Aeronautics and Space Administration]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.space.co.uk/Features/UKSpaceExploration/ARIEL1/tabid/245/Default.aspx |title=Ariel 1 |date=2008-01-02 |publisher=Space.co.uk |accessdate=2009-06-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425173105/http://www.space.co.uk/Features/UKSpaceExploration/ARIEL1/tabid/245/Default.aspx |archivedate=25 April 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; with subsequent spacecraft being produced in Britain. All launches were conducted using American rockets; Ariel 1 on a [[Thor-Delta]], and the remainder on [[Scout (rocket family)|Scouts]].

'''"Aurinko laskee länteen"''' ("The sun sets in the west") was the [[Finland|Finnish]] entry in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1965]], performed in [[Finnish Language|Finnish]] by [[Viktor Klimenko (singer)|Viktor Klimenko]].

The song was performed sixteenth on the night, following [[Luxembourg]]'s [[France Gall]] with "[[Poupée de cire, poupée de son]]" and preceding [[Yugoslavia]]'s [[Vice Vukov]] with "[[Čežnja]]". At the close of voting, it had received the dreaded ''nul points'', placing 15th. This was Finland's second ''nul points'' and second appearance in last place.

The song deals with Klimenko experiencing a very brief love affair and coming to the conclusion that the setting of the sun signals the end of "the time of love".

It was succeeded as [[Finland in the Eurovision Song Contest|Finnish representative]] at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1966|1966 Contest]] by [[Ann-Christine Nyström|Ann Christine]] with "[[Playboy (Ann Christine song)|Playboy]]".

The '''Awadhi people'''  or '''Awadhis''' ([[Awadhi]]/[[Hindi]]: अवधी) are an [[Indo-Aryan peoples|Indo-Aryan]] ethno-linguistic group who speak [[Awadhi]] and reside in the [[Awadh]] region of [[Uttar Pradesh]] and they are part of the larger [[Hindustani people|Hindustani]] ethno-linguistic group. Many Awadhis also migrated to [[Madhya Pradesh]], [[Bihar]], [[Jharkhand]], [[Gujarat]], [[Maharashtra]] in [[India]] and some adjoining regions of the [[Terai]] in [[Nepal]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.india9.com/i9show/Awadhis-48116.htm |title=Awadhis in India}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in addition 1.9 per cent of [[Nepali people|Nepalis]] are Awadhi speakers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/resources/the-world-factbook/geos/np.html |title=CIA - The World Factbook -- Nepal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Awadhi people can be found throughout the world, most notably in the islands of the [[Caribbean]], [[Fiji]], [[Guyana]], [[Mauritius]], [[South Africa]], [[Suriname]], and [[Trinidad and Tobago]]. [[Bollywood]] actor and superstar [[Amitabh Bachchan]] is Awadhi from his father's ([[Harivansh Rai Bachchan]]) side. Historically, [[Indo-Aryans]] dominated the North Indian Gangetic Planes; thus, the [[Awadhi]] language continuously evolved over the centuries in the [[Awadh]] region of Uttar Pradesh.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5123">&lt;!-- EDIT BELOW THIS LINE --&gt;
The '''CAGE Distance Framework''' identifies Cultural, Administrative, Geographic and Economic  differences or distances between countries that companies should address when crafting international strategies.&lt;ref name=cases&gt;''Cases about Redefining Global Strategy'', Pankaj Ghemawat and Jordan Siegel, Harvard Business Review Press, 2011, Chapter 2&lt;/ref&gt; It may also be used to understand patterns of trade, capital, information, and people flows.&lt;ref name=world&gt;''World 3.0: Global Prosperity and How to Achieve it'', Pankaj Ghemawat, Harvard Business Review Press, 2011, pp.54-60&lt;/ref&gt; The framework was developed by [[Pankaj Ghemawat]], a professor at the [[University of Navarra]] - [[IESE Business School]] in Barcelona, Spain.&lt;ref&gt;Pankaj Ghemawat official website: http://www.ghemawat.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

The impacts of CAGE distances and differences have been demonstrated quantitatively via gravity models.  Such models "resemble [[Newton's law of universal gravitation|Newton's law of gravitation]] in linking interactions between countries to the product of their sizes (usually their gross domestic products) divided by some composite measure of distance."&lt;ref name=world /&gt;

==Components==

The table&lt;ref name=redefining /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Distance still matters. The hard reality of global expansion.'', Pankaj Ghemawat, Harvard Business Review , 79, no.8, 2001, p137-147&lt;/ref&gt; shown below provides more detail on each of the CAGE categories, and how they can manifest themselves depending on whether one is comparing a pair of countries or looking at one in isolation.  One of the distinctions between the CAGE Framework and other country analysis frameworks is its inclusion of '''bilateral''' as well as '''unilateral factors'''.&lt;ref name=cases /&gt;

{| class="wikitable"
|-
!
! Cultural Distance
! Administrative Distance
! Geographic Distance
! Economic Distance
|-
| '''Country Pairs (Bilateral)'''
|
* Different languages
* Different ethnicities; lack of connective ethnic or social networks
* Different religions
* Lack of trust
* Different values, norms, and dispositions
| 
* Lack of colonial ties
* Lack of shared regional trading bloc
* Lack of common currency
* Political hostility
| 
* Physical distance
* Lack of land border
* Differences in time zones
* Differences in climates / disease environments
| 
* Rich/poor differences
* Other differences in cost or quality of natural resources, financial resources, human resources, infrastructure, information or knowledge
|-
| '''Countries (Unilateral / Multilateral)'''
| 
* Insularity
* Traditionalism
| 
* Nonmarket/closed economy (home bias vs. foreign bias)
* Lack of membership in international organizations
* Weak institutions, corruption
| 
* Landlockedness
* Lack of internal navigability
* Geographic size
* Geographic remoteness
* Weak transportation or communication links
| 
* Economic size
* Low per capita income
|}&lt;ref name=redefining&gt;''Redefining Global Strategy: Crossing Borders in a World Where Differences Still Matter'', Pankaj Ghemawat, Harvard Business School Press, 2007, p.41&lt;/ref&gt;

==Practical Use==
Ghemawat offers some advice on how the CAGE Framework can help managers considering international strategies:
* It makes distance visible for managers.&lt;ref name=cases /&gt;
* It helps to pinpoint the differences across countries that might handicap multinational companies relative to local competitors.&lt;ref name=cases /&gt;
* It can shed light on the relative position of multinationals from different countries.  For example, it can help explain the strength of Spanish firms in many industries across Latin America.&lt;ref name=cases /&gt;
* It can be used to compare markets from the perspective of a particular company.  One method to conduct quantitative analysis of this type is to discount (specifically, divide) raw measures of market size or potential with measures of distance, broadly defined.&lt;ref name=cases /&gt;

Ghemawat emphasizes that different types of distance matter to different extents depending on the industry.  Because geographic distance, for instance, affects the costs of transportation, it is of particular importance to companies dealing in heavy or bulky products.  Cultural distance, on the other hand, affects consumers’ product preferences. It should be a crucial consideration for a consumer goods or media company, but it is much less important for a cement or steel business.&lt;ref name=cases /&gt;

To facilitate quantitative analysis based on the CAGE framework, Prof. Ghemawat has developed an online tool called the CAGE Comparator. The CAGE Comparator covers 163 home countries and 65 industries, and allows users to customize the impacts of 16 types of CAGE distance.&lt;ref name=cage&gt;CAGE Comparator: http://www.ghemawat.com/cage/&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor Ghemawat recommends using the CAGE framework together with the '''ADDING Value Scorecard''' and the '''AAA Strategies'''.&lt;ref name=casesone&gt;''Cases about Redefining Global Strategy'', Pankaj Ghemawat and Jordan Siegel, Harvard Business Review Press, 2011, Chapter 1&lt;/ref&gt;

'''CGTN''' ('''China Global Television Network'''), formerly known as '''CCTV-9''' and '''CCTV News''', is a Chinese international English-language news channel of the State-owned [[China Global Television Network]] group, part of the [[China Central Television]] (CCTV), based in [[Beijing]]. The channel was launched on 25 September 2000. Coverage includes newscasts, in-depth reports, and commentary programs, as well as feature presentations.  Its [[free-to-air]] satellite signal can be received by more than 85 million viewers, in over 100 countries and regions.&lt;ref name="received"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://china-screen-news.com/2010/04/the-cctvs-international-news-channel-cctv-9-is-renamed-cctv-news|title=About The Heat|accessdate=2012-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is focused towards the [[overseas Chinese|Chinese diaspora]] and English-speaking audience on the international ground.

==History==
CCTV began considering English-language international news programming on 1 January 1979, at the start of China's "[[Reform and opening up]]" period. English news bulletins began on [[CCTV-2]] in 1986 and became available to overseas viewers when they moved to [[CCTV-4]] in February 1991.  CCTV-9 began broadcasting across China on 25 September 2000, becoming the country's first all-English television station.

On 1 January 2003, CCTV-9 entered the United States cable market, as part of a deal that allowed [[AOL]], [[Time Warner]], and [[News Corporation]] access to cable systems in [[Guangdong]].  In its early years, CCTV-9 broadcast English language news bulletins and cultural interest shows for most of each day, and aired mostly [[rerun]]s during the overnight hours in China. One of its biggest projects was covering the [[2008 Beijing Olympics]].

Until April 2010, CCTV-9 was a mixed general interest channel featuring news, travel programming, and language training.  But on the 26th of that month, CCTV-9 was relaunched as a 24-hour English-language news service, and its name was changed to "CCTV News."&lt;ref name="launched"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://english.cctv.com/english/about/index.shtml|title=About CCTV News |accessdate=2009-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 31 December 2016 at midday [[Time in China|Beijing time]], the channel was relaunched as '''CGTN''' (''China Global Television Network''), and new programs debuted.

==Revamp==
[[File:CCTV-NEWS.png|thumb|200px|Original CCTVNEWS logo]]

The channel name of CCTV-9 was changed to CCTV News at 7 pm (Beijing Time) on 26 April 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.cntv.cn/20100426/104481.shtml CCTV News, Your Link to Asia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100512133051/http://english.cntv.cn/20100426/104481.shtml |date=12 May 2010 }} CCTV Press Release, 26 April 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Some  shows were rebranded while other new programs were added. The English website is managed by [[China Network Television]] (CNTV), a web streaming service of CCTV.  On 1 January 2011, the channel's former name CCTV-9 was taken over by [[CCTV-9|CCTV's two documentary channels]].

With new faces, new studios, and new equipment, the channel's upper managers said they hoped to strengthen the network's news gathering abilities, while aiming to present more perspectives from throughout China, and across Asia, to the rest of the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.cntv.cn/program/newsupdate/20100426/104972.shtml China's English news channel relaunches April 26] CCTV Press Release, 26 April 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  The next steps in this process included hiring additional foreign correspondents and setting up a number of international bureaus.

On 6 February 2012, the channel launched “[[CCTV America]]” and a schedule of daily programming originating from a production center in [[Washington, D.C.]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://cctv.cntv.cn/lm/cctvamerica/01/index.shtml About CCTV America] CCTV America&lt;/ref&gt;  On 11 October 2012, CCTV News launched its Africa operation in [[Nairobi, Kenya]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://cctv.cntv.cn/lm/cctvafrica/01/index.shtml About CCTV Africa] CCTV Africa&lt;/ref&gt;  CCTV News currently has three broadcast centers—Beijing (main), Nairobi, and Washington—with 70 additional bureaus across the globe.

The revamp also saw the permanent addition of news and world financial markets tickers, similar to those seen on leading news channels, although these features had already been used intermittently in the previous decade.

==Programming==
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2010}}
CGTN usually airs a live news bulletin in the first half of each hour. As well as a generic news program, there are specialist bulletins focusing on Chinese and Asian news, such as ''China 24'' and business news ''BIZ ASIA''. Programming in the second half of each hour includes, sports bulletins, a travel show called [[Travelogue (TV show)|Travelogue]] which takes viewers to destinations around China and the world, and magazines covering the arts, science and sports.

The programs on CGTN include ''News Update'' and ''News Hour'', providing comprehensive global coverage; and ''China 24'' and ''Asia Today'', delivering the latest domestic and regional developments. Specialized programs include ''Biz Asia'', ''Biz Talk'', ''New Money'', ''Culture Express'' and ''Sports Scene'', providing news and information on business, finance, economics, culture, and sports. Shows such as ''Dialogue'' and ''World Insight'' extend balanced and critical perspectives on current affairs affecting all corners of the globe.

CGTN also provides programs on culture, history, and modern society of China and Asia. In ''Crossover'', hosts and guests of various backgrounds and experiences talk about issues throughout China. ''Travelogue'' is the ticket to dynamic and exciting landscapes in China and abroad. ''Rediscovering China'' explores contemporary Chinese and Asian culture and social changes through the eyes of international visitors. And ''Story Board'' delivers a visual profile of all Asian countries.

==Staff==
The Chinese staff members at CGTN English range in experience from interns to media professionals with years in the business. [[Executive producers]], producers and senior [[news anchors]] typically have higher education, often from universities in other countries. By 2007, the channel had about 300 staff members, of whom 70 were full-time with about 30 foreigners on contract. Ahead of the channel's 2010 relaunch, it began to hire foreign correspondents based in countries around the world, and in 2011 CCTV News started to hire English-speaking Chinese reporters based in 30 provincial bureaus across China.

==Foreign news anchors==
In addition to Chinese anchors, CGTN employs foreigners as [[news presenters]], some of whom have extensive experience, such as [[Edwin Maher]] (a former newsreader and weatherman from the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]), while others may be recent university graduates just embarking upon their careers.

Former comptroller [[Jiang Heping]] defended the policy of putting foreigners on air, arguing that “we feel international on-air personalities boost the credibility of CGTN and befit its image as an international channel. In this regard, CGTN will not restrict the origin of its employees and choose to build its unique identity through its programming.”&lt;ref name=JiangHeping&gt;{{cite book |last=Jiang Heping |editor=Sucharita S. Eashwar |title=Asia Media Summit 2005: Promoting Peace and Prosperity in a Globalised World |url=http://download.aibd.org.my/books/AMS_05_Promoting_Peace_and_Prosperity.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2007-09-13 |year=2005 |publisher=Asia-Pacific Institute for Broadcasting Development |isbn=983-41053-3-9 |pages=173–75 |chapter=Window on China and the World: CCTV News |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071129114254/http://download.aibd.org.my/books/AMS_05_Promoting_Peace_and_Prosperity.pdf |archivedate=29 November 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first foreign news anchor on what was then known as CCTV-9 was [[Chris Gelken]], who joined the channel from [[Hong Kong]]'s [[TVB]] and presented the 30-minute business show, ''BizChina.'' Gelken left CCTV News in 2005, and returned to [[TVB News|TVB]] from 2010 to 2013.

Another prominent personality in CCTV-9's first decade was [[Mark Rowswell]], otherwise known as [[Dashan]]. He hosted ''Travel in Chinese'' on CCTV News and has been honored for his work in promoting cancer awareness in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |accessdate=2007-05-04|title=China’s Most Famous Foreigner to Receive Prestigious&amp;nbsp;– Mark Rowswell ("Dashan") to be Honoured for Raising Awareness of Cancer in China |first=Sophie |last= Welter |url=http://www.cancer.ca/ccs/internet/mediareleaselist/0,,3543_434465_288488355_langId-en.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to those individuals, the channel later recruited [[Phillip TK Yin|Phillip Yin]] of [[Bloomberg Television]], and [[Mike Walter (newsman)|Mike Walter]] from [[USA Today]], to helm Biz Asia America and The Heat, respectively, when the Washington bureau opened in 2012.

The weather on CGTN is hosted by a rotating cast of presenters, so the staff changes on a frequent basis, partially because these updates are produced by an outside company which supplies content for several English-language media outlets around China.

==CGTN Africa==
{{main|CGTN Africa}}
CCTV Africa is China Central Television's news productions center which was launched in Kenya on 11 January 2012. CGTN Africa focuses on African news and perspectives as well as international news.

CGTN Africa is responsible for newsgathering and task assignments on the African continent. CGTN Africa initially produce a one-hour program every day, including Africa news, Talk Africa and Face of Africa editions, and broadcast through CGTN's English news channel.

==CGTN America==
{{main|CGTN America}}

CGTN America is the Americas division of CGTN the English-language news channel run by Chinese state broadcaster China Central Television. It is based in Washington, DC and runs bureaus across North and South America. The service employs a mix of American and Chinese journalists and produces Americas-based programming for CGTN and CCTV.

CGTN America is led by director general Ma Jing with veteran Asia journalist Jim Laurie as executive consultant. It began broadcasting on 6 February 2012.

==Criticisms==
Despite its revamp launching of CCTV America, critics have voiced concerns over the level of self-censorship exercised by the channel, especially on sensitive domestic issues in China. Philip Cunningham of Cornell University, who has appeared more than 100 times on China Central Television talk shows said sensitive issues such as Tibet and Xinjiang were heavily edited on various programs.&lt;ref name="pbs.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/world-jan-june12-cctv_03-23 |title=China's Programming for U.S. Audiences: Is it News or Propaganda? |date=22 March 2012 |work=PBS NewsHour |accessdate=2 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{

Ma Jing, Director of CCTV America defends such allegation by saying that the channel edits stories the same way other news organizations do. She said: "We uphold the traditional journalistic values. We consider accuracy, objectivity, truthfulness, and public accountability very important, more important than anything else."&lt;ref name="pbs.org"/&gt;

On November 23, 2018, a British corporate investigator submitted a formal complaint &lt;ref&gt;https://www.washingtonpost.com/pb/business/british-man-seeks-china-state-tv-ban-for-forced-confession/2018/11/23/72acfdd0-ef42-11e8-8b47-bd0975fd6199_story.html?nid=menu_nav_accessibilityforscreenreader&amp;outputType=accessibility&amp;utm_term=.1c2eafc3ada0&lt;/ref&gt; to the United Kingdom's government communications regulator The Office of Communications, or Ofcom, maintaining he was forced under duress to confess on air over Chinese state broadcaster China Central Television's (CCTV) network and that, as the confession was subsequently broadcast&lt;ref&gt;https://www.scmp.com/news/world/europe/article/2174927/uk-watchdog-may-probe-china-state-medias-role-confession-peter&lt;/ref&gt; over the international arm of CCTV, China Global Television Network (CGTN), CGTN itself should be held culpable by Ofcom and denied the right to operate its broadcast service in the U.K. Reportedly Ofcom has said it is investigating the complaint and would "take necessary enforcement action" if rules are determined to have been violated.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.apnews.com/6ba64ce1f5294262a05c055dea5c3576&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Cantino planisphere''' or '''Cantino world map''' is the earliest surviving map showing [[Portuguese discoveries|Portuguese geographic discoveries]] in the east and west. It is named after '''Alberto Cantino''', an agent for the [[Ercole I d'Este, Duke of Ferrara|Duke of Ferrara]], who successfully smuggled it from [[Portugal]] to [[Italy]] in 1502. The map is particularly notable for portraying a fragmentary record of the [[Brazil]]ian coast, which the Portuguese explorer [[Pedro Álvares Cabral]] explored in 1500, and for depicting the African coast of the Atlantic and Indian Oceans with a remarkable accuracy and detail. It was valuable at the beginning of the sixteenth century because it showed detailed and up-to-date strategic information in a time when geographic knowledge of the world was growing at a fast pace. It contains unique historical information about the maritime exploration and the evolution of nautical cartography. The Cantino planisphere is the earliest extant nautical chart where places (in Africa and parts of Brazil and India) are depicted according to their astronomically observed latitudes.

==History==
[[File:Cantino west.jpg|thumb|180px|left|West and the recently reached Americas, [[Treaty of Tordesillas|Tordesillas]] line depicted - Cantino planisphere detail]]
[[File:Compass rose Cantino.jpg|thumb|180px|Major wind rose of the Cantino planisphere]]
In the beginning of the 16th century, [[Lisbon]] was a buzzing metropolis where people from diverse backgrounds came in search of work, glory or fortune. There were also many undercover agents looking for the secrets brought by the Portuguese voyages to remote lands. Among them was Alberto Cantino, who was sent to Portugal by [[Ercole I d'Este, Duke of Ferrara]], with the formal intention of [[horse trading]], while secretly collecting information on [[History of Portugal (1415–1578)|Portuguese Discoveries]]. Cantino’s diligence is shown in two of his letters to the Duke, dated from 17 and 18 October 1501, where he describes, amongst other things, hearing Portuguese explorer [[Gaspar Corte-Real]] detailing his latest voyage to [[Newfoundland]] (Terra Nova) to [[Manuel I of Portugal|King Manuel I]].

A popular theory, introduced in the earliest studies of the map,&lt;ref&gt;Duarte Leite (1923), 225-32&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that the Cantino Planisphere was ordered to an official Portuguese mapmaker, who made a copy of the royal cartographic pattern, the so-called ''Padrão Real'', kept in the ''Armazéns da Índia''. However, there is no historical evidence that such order was ever made and the theory is weakened by the presence of numerous mistakes. One would expect a carefully made copy of an official standard, if it existed in Portugal at that time, would be accurate.&lt;ref&gt;Gaspar (2012), 181-82&lt;/ref&gt; A more plausible explanation is that the map was surreptitiously acquired shortly after it was made for some nobleman or official client.&lt;ref&gt;Gaspar (2010), 182; 195&lt;/ref&gt; From a letter sent by Cantino to his patron, the Duke of Ferrara, on 19 November 1502, we know that he paid 12 golden [[ducat]]s for it, which was a considerable amount for the time. An Italian inscription in the back of the map reads: ''Carta de navigar per le Isole nouam trovate in le parte de India: dono Alberto Cantino al S. Duca Hercole'', which translates as 'Navigational chart of the islands recently [discovered]... in part of the Indies: from Alberto Cantino to Duke Hercole'.

While it enlightened the Italians to many new territories yet unknown to them, it was obsolete within months due to subsequent mapping voyages by the Portuguese. Nevertheless, its importance to the Portuguese–Italian trade relations should not be understated; this map provided the Italians with knowledge of Brazil's coastline and that of much of the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] Coast of [[South America]] long before other nations even knew South America extended so far to the south. It also supplied great details of the [[Indian Ocean]]. It also maps the east coast of North America, at least from Florida to New York, and includes descriptive place names such as Rio de las Almadias (River of Rafts), which describes the unique vegetation rafts in the [[St. Johns River]] in Florida.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}  Others argue that this peninsula was actually intended to represent part of [[China]], [[Cuba]], or the [[Yucatan Peninsula]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://journals.fcla.edu/flgeog/article/view/77942/75378 | title=THE FIRST EUROPEAN CHARTING OF FLORIDA AND THE ADJACENT SHORES | author=Peck, Douglas T. | journal=The Florida Geographer | year=2003 | volume=34 | pages=82–113}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The geographical information given on the Cantino map was copied into the Italian-made [[Caverio map|Canerio (or Caveri) map]] shortly after the Cantino map arrived in Italy and the Canerio, in turn, became the primary source for the design of the newly discovered western lands on the highly influential wall map of the world produced by [[Martin Waldseemüller]] in 1507 under the auspices of Rene, Duke of Lorraine.

This old map, made-up by 6 glued [[parchment]] sheets, was kept in the Ducal Library, [[Ferrara]], for about 90 years, until [[Pope Clement VIII]] transferred it to another palace in [[Modena]], Italy. More than two centuries later, in 1859, the palace was ransacked and the Cantino Map lost. It was found by Giuseppe Boni, Director of the Biblioteca Estense, in that same year, in a butcher’s store in Modena. The Cantino world map can currently be found in [[Modena]], Italy, at the [[Biblioteca Estense]].

== Construction ==
[[File:Cantino rhumb line system.JPG|thumb|300px|The rhumb-line construction scheme and geographic lines in the Cantino planisphere. Adapted from Gaspar (2012), Plate 3]]
The Cantino planisphere is the earliest extant example of the so-called ''latitude chart'', which was developed following the introduction of astronomical navigation, during the second half of the fifteenth century. Contrarily to the portolan charts of the Mediterranean, which were constructed on the basis of magnetic courses and estimated distances between places, in the latitude chart places were represented according to their latitudes. In the Cantino planisphere, latitudes were incorporated only in the coasts of Africa, Brazil and India, while Europe and the Caribbean Sea continued to be represented according to the portolan-chart model &lt;ref&gt;Gaspar (2012), 129-82&lt;/ref&gt;).

The construction of the [[rhumb lines|rhumb line]] system in the Cantino planisphere uses two circles (some charts use only one, others use as many as three, depending of size): the western circle is centered on the [[Cape Verde|Cape Vert]] Islands, the eastern circle is centered in India. The circumference of each circle is marked with sixteen equally spaced points, from which radiate the 32 classic rhumbs: 0°, 11 1/4°, 22 1/2°, 33 3/4°, etc. The western and eastern outer circles are tangent to each other at a large wind-rose in central Africa, with a [[fleur-de-lis]] indicating North. This dense rhumb-line mesh was used in navigation as a reference, for reading and marking directions (courses) between places. Six scale bars graduated in Iberian leagues, with a variable number of sections (or ''logs''), are distributed over the chart's area. These were used to measure distances between places.

Illustrations are few, but elaborate. Two cities are grandly depicted - [[Venice]] and [[Jerusalem]]. There is also an elaborate depiction of the Portuguese castle of São Jorge da Mina ([[Elmina Castle]], on the [[Portuguese Gold Coast|Gold Coast]] of [[west Africa]]), flanked by two African towns. Other illustrations include a lion-shaped mountain representing the [[Sierra Leone]] mountain range, the [[Pharos of Alexandria|Alexandria lighthouse]] (laid horizontal), the mythical [[Mountains of the Moon (Africa)|Mountains of the Moon]] (legendary source of the [[Nile River]]) in central Africa, and either the [[Table Mountain]] or [[Drakensberg]] range in South Africa. Along the central African coast are the various cross stone markers (''[[Padrão|padrões]]'') erected by [[Diogo Cão]] and [[Bartolomeu Dias]] in the 1480s.

In north Africa, there is the "Montes Claros" in the usual place of the [[Atlas mountains]], the legend below on the left reading that "this is the land of King Organo, whose king is very noble and very rich", and to the right that this is the "land of the King of Nubia, the king of which is continuously making war on [[Prester John]] and is a moor and a great enemy of Christians".

== Discoveries ==
The Brazilian coast was certainly the last to be added and reached its present form in three phases: to the first belong an initial coastline running to southeast from ''Golfo fremosso'' to ''Cabo Sam Jorge'', and from there, to north of ''Porto Seguro'', continuing further south to the tip of the landmass. Only a relatively small portion of the coast, between the flag near the ''Vera cruz'' inscription and the northern side of the ''baia de todos os santos'' would have been surveyed, in 1500, by the fleet of Pedro Álvares Cabral. To the second phase belongs the pasting of the strip of parchment between ''Rio de sã franc°'' and ''Golfo fremosso'', which would have been based on the information brought by the fleet of João da Nova, who arrived in Lisbon in September 1502. In the third phase the island named ''quaresma'', together with some names written in cursive would have been added .&lt;ref&gt;Roukema (1963), p. 7-8&lt;/ref&gt;

The European rediscovery of [[Greenland]] is thought to have been by João Fernandes Labrador and Pedro de Barcelos between 1495 and 1498, and also visited by [[Giovanni Caboto]] (John Cabot), in the English expedition of 1498. But the depiction of the island on the map suggests it was based on the Portuguese mission of Labrador and Barcelos. [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] was probably visited by an English expedition in 1497-98, and again, by the Portuguese explorer [[Gaspar Corte-Real]] in 1500 and 1501. The map makes clear that the land was discovered and charted for Portugal by [[Gaspar Corte-Real]], for King [[Manuel I of Portugal]].

== North American section ==

[[File:Cantino Map - 1502 - Florida.jpg|thumb|200px|A depiction of what might be Florida from the 1502 Cantino map]]
The North American section of the Cantino map is historically very important. It represents one of the very first mappings of America's East Coast, and includes descriptive place names. It may map both coasts of [[Florida]], and 11 years before [[Juan Ponce de León|Ponce de León]] got credit for discovering Florida in 1513. Other suggestions include the possibility it reflects the belief that Columbus reached Asia and it is meant to show the mainland of Asia or that it represents [[Yucatán Peninsula|Yucatán]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Allen|first=John Logan|title=A New World Disclosed|year=1997|publisher=University of Nebraska Press|isbn=978-0803210158|page=198}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Newfoundland]], which was visited in 1500 and 1501 by [[Gaspar Corte-Real]] and his brother Miguel, members of the Portuguese royal household, is labeled as ''Terra del Rey de Portuguall'' on the Cantino map.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.loc.gov/rr/hispanic/portam/coast.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dalia''' is the [[goddess]] of [[destiny|fate]] in the [[Lithuanian mythology]]. She is the giver and taker of goods and property. Dalia is often confused with and hard to distinguish from [[Laima]], another goddess of fate. Sometimes Dalia is thought of as a different manifestation of Laima.&lt;ref name=greimas127/&gt; However, Laima is more involved in predicting the length of a person's life while Dalia is more concerned with material wealth a person would earn during the lifetime – allotting a proper share (Lithuanian: ''dalis'') to everyone.&lt;ref name=gimbu/&gt; According to myths, just as a father divides his estate among the children, so Dievas Senelis (manifestation of supreme god [[Dievas]]) allots each newborn with a proper share.&lt;ref name=greimas127/&gt; Dalia is seen more as an enforcer of Dievas' will rather than a decision maker.&lt;ref name=greimas127/&gt; She can appear as a woman, lamb, dog, swan, or duck.&lt;ref name=zinkus/&gt;

'''''Dáithí Lacha''''' ({{IPA-ga|d̪ˠaːhiː l̪ˠaxa}}, meaning "David Duck") was an [[Irish language]] television cartoon series for children broadcast on [[RTÉ One|RTÉ]] during the 1960s. The series was not animated, however. For each five-minute episode, the creator, illustrator, and camera operator, Flann Ó Riain, produced a static comic strip which was shown one frame at a time.&lt;ref&gt;''The Irish Times'', "Exhibition of cartoons", 23 November 1972&lt;/ref&gt; A single narrator, Pádraic Ó Gaora, described the action and spoke the dialogue.

As well as the central character, the series featured Maidhc the dog and Puisín the cat.

The first episode was broadcast on 31 December 1962.&lt;ref&gt;''The Irish Times'', "Today's TV programmes", 31 December 1962&lt;/ref&gt; For the first few years of its run, the series was transmitted three days a week. By the time the final episode appeared in July 1969, ''Dáithí Lacha'' had become a weekly show.

Today, [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]'s first home-grown television cartoon star is remembered by viewers of that generation for his frequent cries of ''"Aililiú!"'' ({{lang-en|Good heavens!}}),&lt;ref&gt;''The Irish Times'', "SOCK HORROR", 14 December 1996&lt;/ref&gt; as well as for his large striped underpants — the only garb he wore.

The '''Electoral Union''' ({{lang-pt|União Eleitoral}}, UE) was a political alliance in [[Guinea-Bissau]].

==History==
The UE was established in 2002 as an alliance of the [[Guinean League for Ecological Protection]] (LIPE), the [[Party of Renewal and Progress]] (PRP), the [[Social Democratic Party (Guinea-Bissau)|Social Democratic Party]] (PSD) and the [[Socialist Party of Guinea-Bissau|Socialist Party]] (PSGB), as well as a dissident faction of the [[Resistance of Guinea-Bissau-Bafatá Movement]]. It was initially headed by [[Joaquim Baldé]] of the PSD,&lt;ref name=HD&gt;Peter Karibe Mendy (2013) ''Historical Dictionary of the Republic of Guinea-Bissau'', Scarecrow Press, p398&lt;/ref&gt; but was designed to have a rotating presidency.&lt;ref name=M1&gt;Mendy, p399&lt;/ref&gt;

The Union received 4% of the vote in the [[Guinea-Bissau legislative election, 2004|2004 parliamentary elections]], winning two seats.&lt;ref&gt;Bogdan Szajkowski (2005) ''Political Parties of the World'', p272&lt;/ref&gt; It supported [[African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde|PAIGC]] candidate [[Malam Bacai Sanhá]] in the [[Guinea-Bissau presidential election, 2005|2005 presidential elections]], which were won by [[João Bernardo Vieira]].

Leadership crises prevented the party from contesting elections in [[Guinea-Bissau legislative election, 2008|2008]] and [[Guinea-Bissau presidential election, 2009|2009]], after which it was dissolved.&lt;ref name=M1/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1498">'''Emma of Paris''' (943 – 19 March 968), was a duchess consort of [[Normandy]], married to [[Richard I, Duke of Normandy]]. She was the daughter of Count [[Hugh the Great]] of Paris and [[Hedwige of Saxony|Hedwiga de Sachsen]] and sister of [[Hugh Capet]], king of France.  

Emma was betrothed to Richard I in her childhood as a part of an alliance between Normandy and Paris against the French royal house. The marriage took place in 960. The union gave a permanent and useful status to Normandy, especially since the brother of Emma became king in 987. Emma has been pointed out as the mother of [[Emma of Normandy]], but this is not chronologically possible. Emma died childless.

==Culture and technology==
[[Economics|Economically]] and [[Technology|technologically]], Faerûn is comparable to Western [[Europe]] during the late [[Middle Ages]], giving most new players using this campaign setting an intuitive grasp of the way the society functions. [[Gunpowder]], known here as the magical substance ''smoke powder'' and different in its composition from historical gunpowder, is starting to make an appearance, but much of the armament is still dominated by pre-gunpowder weaponry such as [[sword]]s, [[spear]]s, and [[bow (weapon)|bow]]s. Most of the population of Faerûn consists of [[farmer]]s, who are organized somewhat loosely in a semi-[[feudal system]]. There are also a number of notable [[City|cities]], and [[trade]] between [[nation]]s is common, as in the [[Renaissance]] era. Likewise, there are regions where more barbaric tribes and customs persist.&lt;ref name="FRCS"/&gt;

A major difference between the setting and Earth is the presence of [[Magic of Dungeons &amp; Dragons|magic]]. The system of magic is subdivided into divine and arcane categories, with the former empowered by a [[List of Forgotten Realms deities|Faerûnian deity]], and the latter by rituals or innate abilities which manipulate a mystical field called the [[Weave (Forgotten Realms)|Weave]], the source of magical energies on [[Abeir-Toril|Toril]]. Faerûn has a pantheon of deities that are worshipped by the inhabitants of this region. These are comparable to mythological deities of the ancient Greek pantheon, and cover a range of ethical beliefs and portfolios of interests.

Faerûn is home to a number of non-human creatures of varying degrees of civilization or barbarism. Among these are several different races of [[Dwarf (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|dwarves]], [[Gnome (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|gnomes]], [[halfling]]s and [[Elf (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|elves]], as well as [[Goblin (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|goblins]], [[Orc (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|orcs]], [[lizardfolk|lizardmen]], [[Ogre (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|ogres]], various [[Giant (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|giants]], and even [[Dragon (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|dragons]].

There are a number of organized alliances in Faerûn, with each pursuing their own particular agenda. A few are dedicated to decent and honest causes, such as the [[Harpers (Forgotten Realms)|Harpers]], who protect the good-natured races and seek a balance between civilization and nature. The Harpers are opposed by evil organizations, including the [[Red Wizards of Thay]] and the [[nihilism|nihilistic]] [[Cult of the Dragon]]. In the northern lands, the [[Zhentarim]] is an evil network seeking to dominate the region. Their efforts are being resisted by the Lords' Alliance, a council of knights that pursues the interests of the northern cities. Other organizations of Faerûn include the magical Seven Sisters, a band of assassins called the Fire Knives, a group of ruthless thieves operating out the city of Waterdeep named Xanathar's Guild, and the mysterious Shades—-the returning survivors of the long-fallen Netheril empire.&lt;ref name="FRCS"/&gt;

==Geography==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Forgotten Realms]] --&gt;
{{see also|Geographical index of Toril}}

The sub-continent of Faerûn is set on the planet [[Abeir-Toril|Toril]], or, more formally, "Abeir-Toril." Faerûn is the western part of an unnamed supercontinent that is quite similar to real-world [[Afro-Eurasia]]. This continent also includes [[Kara-Tur]], which was the original setting of the D&amp;D [[Oriental Adventures]] campaign setting, and [[Zakhara]], home to the ''Arabian Nights'' setting [[Al-Qadim]]. [[Maztica]], home of a tribal, [[Aztec]]-like civilization is far to the west, across an Atlantic-like ocean called the Trackless Sea. The subterranean regions underneath Faerûn are called the [[Underdark]].&lt;ref name="FRCS"/&gt;

Faerûn includes terrain that is as varied as that of [[Europe]], western [[Asia]], and much of [[Africa]] is on our planet [[Earth]]. Role-playing [[Campaign (role-playing games)|campaigns]] in Faerûn can be set in a wide variety of locations, each with its own hazards and potential rewards for the participants. Likewise, the region that the [[Player character|player]]s explore can determine what types of monsters they will face, which famous [[Non-player character|individuals]] they will encounter, and what types of [[Quest (gaming)|missions]] they assume.

Besides the exterior coastline to the west and south, the most dominant feature on the continent is the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]]. This is an irregular inland sea that keeps the neighboring lands fertile and serves as a major trade route for the bordering nations. Next in significance is the Shaar, a broad region of grasslands in the south that, together with a large body of water called the Lake of Steam, separates the area around the inland sea from the coastal nations at the southern edge of the continent. To the east, Faerûn is bordered by a vast region of [[steppe]] that separates it from [[Kara-Tur]]. In the north are massive glaciers, named Pelvuria and Reghed, and a region of [[tundra]]. South of the continent, separated by the Great Sea, is a sub-tropical land called Zakhara.

===Northern regions===

To the northwest, Faerûn is a region of wilderness, difficult winter weather, hordes of orcs, and barbarous human tribes. This region is generally referred to as "The North". It is a mostly-untamed region that lies between the large Anauroch desert in the east and the expansive Sea of Swords to the west. This area contains huge wooded regions such as the [[High Forest (Forgotten Realms)|High Forest]] and the Lurkwood, the frozen [[Icewind Dale (region)|Icewind Dale]] to the north, and an untamed region called the Savage Frontier, which includes the Silver Marches (Luruar). The coastal region is called the Sword Coast. Here lies the city-state of Neverwinter and the large port city of Waterdeep.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Northeastern Faerûn is a remote area that begins in the cold, forbidding lands along the great ice sheets and continues south toward the northeastern shores of the Sea of Fallen Stars. It is bordered on the west by the mountain-hemmed land of Vaasa and stretches east to the vast steppes of the Hordelands. This region also contains the lightly populated kingdom of Damara, the [[Druid (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|druidic]] forests of the Great Dale, the coastal kingdom of Impiltur, the fallen and once evil empire of Narfell, and the trading nation of Thesk. Mystical Rashemen is a land ruled from behind the scenes by spiritual witches,&lt;ref name="unapproachable_east"/&gt; and it is the location of the ''[[Neverwinter Nights 2: Mask of the Betrayer]]'' computer game. The lands of Damara and Vaasa were described in a 1989 publication, ''FR9, [[The Bloodstone Lands]]''.&lt;ref name="schick"/&gt; This area formed the setting for the "[[List of Dungeons &amp; Dragons modules|H Series]]" of modules that used the [[Battlesystem]] rules to resolve battles.

===Middle lands===
The western part of Faerûn includes the nations south of Waterdeep and north of the ''Shining Sea'', that border along the Sea of Swords. The west includes the city of [[Baldur's Gate (city)|Baldur's Gate]], the nations of Amn, Tethyr, Calimshan,  the region of Western Heartlands and the elven stronghold of Evereska. These regions were the setting for the ''[[Baldur's Gate (series)|Baldur's Gate]]'' series of computer games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

[[File:Bloodstone lands book cover.jpg|left|thumb|150px|The Bloodstone Lands module from TSR.]]

With the exception of the Shining Plains, the interior lands of Faerûn lie along the irregular coastline of the western Sea of Fallen Stars. In the north the Dragonmere arm of the sea extends far to the west, ending close to the Western Heartlands. To the south, the Vilhon Reach forms a second arm leading to the southwest. The notable areas within this region include Chondath, Cormyr,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Baker |first1=Rich |authorlink1=Richard Baker (game designer) |last2=Cordell |first2=Bruce R. |authorlink2=Bruce R.

Along the eastern expanses of the Sea of Fallen Stars, the water forms a long arm that travels to the east before turning south to become the Alamber Sea. The northern nations of this mysterious area are termed the "Unapproachable East" and the southern nations the "Old Empires" in campaign setting publications. This region includes the nations of Aglarond, Altumbel, Mulhorand, Murghôm, Thay and Unther. Chondalwood is a long, forested region to the south of Chondath and Chessenta.&lt;ref name="unapproachable_east"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Baker |first1=Richard |authorlink1=Richard Baker (game designer) |last2=Forbeck |first2=Matt |authorlink2=Matt Forbeck |last3=Reynolds |first3=Sean K. |authorlink3=Sean K. Reynolds |date=2003 |title=[[Unapproachable East (supplement)|Unapproachable East]] |publisher=Wizards of the Coast |isbn=0-7869-2881-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Southern nations===
To the southwest lies along the great Chultan peninsula that juts out toward the west. The waters to the north are named the Shining Sea, a body bounded by Calimsham to the north and joined to the Lake of Steam through the Straits of Storm. To the south of the land is the Great Sea. Located in this area are Chult, Lapaliiya, Samarach, Tashalar, and Thindol.

South of the Sea of Fallen Stars is a region somewhat isolated by the Lake of Steam in the west, and the vast length of the Shaar. It is bordered along the south by the Great Sea; to the west by the Chultan peninsula region, and in the east by Luiren. The south includes the Border Kingdoms, Dambrath, the Great Rift, Halruaa, the Lake of Steam, and The Shaar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Reid |first=Thomas M. |authorlink=Thomas M. Reid|date=2004 |title=[[Shining South (accessory)|Shining South]] |publisher=Wizards of the Coast |isbn=0-7869-3492-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

South and east of the grassy plains is an area known as the Shaar, along the shores of the Great Sea opposite the land of Zakhara. The region includes the lands of Durpar, Estagund and Var the Golden (collectively called the ''Shining Lands''), Luiren, the land of Halflings, Ulgarth, the easternmost extent of Faerûn, and Veldorn, the land of monsters, as well as The Great Rift, a large, powerful nation of dwarves, within a titanic canyon.

===Underdark===
{{main|Underdark}}
The immense complex of caverns and passages that lie beneath many parts of the continent of Faerûn is known as the Underdark. It contains cities of the elf-related [[Drow (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|drow]] including the infamous [[Menzoberranzan]] and the ruins of Ched Nasad, as well as Maerdrimydra, Llurth Dreir and Sshamath; cities of [[Duergar (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|duergar]] such as Gracklstugh and Dunnspeirrin; and almost unpronounceable cities of creatures called the [[kuo-toa]], [[illithid]]s, and [[Beholder (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|beholders]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cordell |first1=Bruce R. |authorlink1=Bruce R.

==Changes in geography==

===Third Edition===
When the third edition of the ''Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting'' was released in 2001, the designers took the opportunity to redesign the continent of Faerûn. Its size was reduced slightly to remove 'empty space' from the map and the Chultan Peninsula was moved several hundred miles north, reducing the size of the empty grassplain known as the Shaar. Additionally, the designers slightly adjusted the projection of the map to better reflect the curvature of the planet. There was no in-universe explanation given for these changes as it was classified as a [[retcon]].

===Fourth Edition===
The fourth edition of the ''Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting'', released in 2008, saw major changes to the geography of Faerûn and the world of [[Abeir-Toril]]. Due to a magical cataclysm known as the Spellplague, the southern parts of Faerûn were devastated. Chult became an island detached from the mainland, the kingdom of Halruaa was utterly destroyed, and parts of the Sea of Fallen Stars drained into the Underdark. The northern Realms were less affected by the Spellplague, but during the 100-year gap between the third and fourth editions of the setting it was revealed that the Netherese wizards of the city of Shade had eliminated the desert of Anauroch, returning the land to its pre-Fall state. The borders of some of the kingdoms were changed to reflect this. In addition to these changes, floating islands of earth known as 'earthmotes' appeared in the skies above Faerûn and the continent of Maztica across the western ocean vanished along with the Faerûnian colonies on its east coast.&lt;ref name="FRCG"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Greenwood |first1=Ed |authorlink1=Ed Greenwood |last2=Cordell |first2=Bruce R. |authorlink2=Bruce R.

'''''Federmesser'' group''' is an archaeological umbrella term 
including the late [[Upper Paleolithic]] to [[European Mesolithic|Mesolithic]] cultures of the  [[Northern European Plain]], dating to between 14,000  and 12,800 years ago (the late [[Magdalenian]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The British Palaeolithic: Human Societies at the Edge of the Pleistocene World|first1=Paul|last1=Pettit|first2=Mark|last2=White|pages=479-80|publisher=Routledge|year=2012|location=Abingdon, UK|isbn=978-0-415-67455-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is closely related to the Tjongerian culture, as both have been suggested&lt;ref&gt;
J.-G. Rozoy, trans. L.G. Strauss, "The (Re-)Population of Northern France between 13,000 and 8000 BP", ''Quaternary International'', Vol. 49j/50 (1998), 69&amp;ndash;86, 1998.  {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120804222518/http://www.membres.lycos.fr/rozoyprehistoire/Travaux/repop/cadre.html |date=2012-08-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
It includes the ''Tjongerian''-sites at [[Lochtenrek]] in the Frisian part of the Netherland, , ''[[Tarnów|Tarnowian]]'' and ''Witowian'' cultures, spanning the area of  Belgium, the Netherlands, northern France, northern Germany and Poland.
It is closely related to the adjacient [[Bromme culture]] to the north, the 
[[Creswellian]] to the west, and the [[Azilian]] to the south.
The name is derived from the characteristic small backed flint blades, in German termed  ''Federmesser'' ("quill knife").
It is succeeded by the [[Ahrensburg culture]] after 12,800 BP.

'''Finnish science fiction fandom''' started getting organized in [[Finland]] when the first science fiction [[Club (organization)|club]] (the Turku Science Fiction Society) was founded in [[Turku]] in 1976. The first fan conventions were in 1982 and 1985. The Finnish national convention, [[Finncon]], was established in 1986. One of the main actors to start an active fan culture in Finland was [[Tom Ölander]].

Biggest [[semiprozine]]s in Finland are ''Portti'', edited by Raimo Nikkonen, and ''[[Tähtivaeltaja]]'', edited by [[Toni Jerrman]].

The '''flag of [[Mohéli]]''' is a yellow field with a red star. It was adopted in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cahoon|first=Ben|title=Comoros|url=http://www.worldstatesmen.org/Comoros.html#Moheli|work=World Statesmen.org|accessdate=15 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It replaced the previous flag, which was adopted when Mohéli became an autonomous island in 2002.

Mohéli separatists formerly flew plain a red flag with a yellow hoist, based on the flag used during the reign of Sultan [[Jumbe Fatima bint Abderremane]] in the 19th century.

The '''flag of Sogn og Fjordane''' is the official flag for [[Sogn og Fjordane]] county in [[Norway]].  It was introduced on 23 September 1983. The flag is a banner of the [[Coat of arms of Sogn og Fjordane]].  The design of the flag shows the geographical layout of the county: three large [[fjord]]s (in blue) protruding into the land (in white). The three fjords are the [[Nordfjorden (Sogn og Fjordane)|Nordfjord]], [[Sunnfjord]], and [[Sognefjord]]. Nearly all villages and towns are situated on one of these fjords and the name of the county is based on the fjords.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ngw.nl/int/nor/sognfjord.htm|title=Sogn og Fjordane|publisher=Norske Kommunevåpen|accessdate=23 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The flag is almost exclusively used by the [[Sogn og Fjordane County Municipality|County Administration]]. As with other counties in Norway the general public uses the [[Flag of Norway]]. 

The company flag of [[Fjord1 Fylkesbaatane]] (in use from 1858 to 2009) has received some attention as a flag that represents Sogn og Fjordane county.  Even though the company has adopted a new flag as part of a modern re-branding, the old Fylkesbaatane flag is still more prevalently seen than the official county flag.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.firda.no/nyhende/article4743419.ece|title=Article on the Fylkesbaatane flag|publisher=Newspaper Firda|accessdate=23 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The GSD had ten candidates (all of which were elected), Bossano's party the [[Gibraltar Socialist Labour Party]] (GSLP) had seven candidates (four of which were elected) and the [[Gibraltar Liberal Party]] (GLP) led by [[Joseph Garcia (Gibraltarian politician)|Dr. Joseph Garcia]] had three candidates (all of which were elected). The [[Progressive Democratic Party (Gibraltar)|Progressive Democratic Party]] (PDP) fielded six candidates, five of whom obtained the fewest votes in the election after a lacklustre campaign. Two independents were unable to break through Gibraltar's party block vote system but did relatively well. They were the [[right-wing politics|right wing]] lawyer [[Charles Gomez]] of [[New Gibraltar Democracy]] and Richard Martinez of the Parental Support Group.

An [[exit poll]] organised by the [[Gibraltar Broadcasting Corporation]] (GBC) had given victory to the GSLP/Liberal [[political coalition|coalition]], but as counting progressed this proved incorrect.

'''Intelsat IV F-3''' was a [[geostationary]] [[communication]] [[satellite]] built by [[Hughes Aircraft Company|Hughes]], it was owned by [[Intelsat]]. The satellite was based on the [[Spacebus|HS-353]] platform and its estimated useful life was 7 years.

== History ==
The Intelsat IV F-3 was part of the Intelsat IV series which consisted of 6 satellites, of which five were successfully placed into orbit. All five satellites in the series were retired and operated an average of almost 4 years beyond their life expectancies. The satellite antenna allowed coverage from the land masses on both sides of the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] basin with four point beams and had sufficient insulation between the east beams and the western beams that used the same frequencies in the east and west. The separation of the beam by directional [[Antenna (radio)|antenna]] allowed this dual use of the frequency, significantly increasing the capacity of satellite communication within an assigned frequency range. Although the initial requirement Intelsat VAT series was only for the Atlantic service, but also was given special attention during the project to provide service on the [[Indian Ocean]] and [[Pacific Ocean]].

The satellite had 20 transponders (individual radio transmitters) compared to 12 on board each Intelsat IV satellite. It had a total height of 22 feet, 11 inches (7.01 meters) and a diameter of 7 feet, 9 inches (2.38 meters). The solar panels, covered with about 17,000 solar cells, provided primary energy of 600 watts. The weight of the satellite, which had an orbiting life project of 7 years, was about £3335 (1,515&amp;nbsp;kg).

The satellite was successfully launched into space on December 21, 1971, by means of an [[Atlas-Centaur]] vehicle from the [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station]], [[United States]]. It had a launch mass of 1,515&amp;nbsp;kg.&lt;ref&gt;Krebs, Gunter. [http://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/intelsat-4a.htm Intelsat-4A]. ''Gunter's Space Page''. Retrieved 21 April 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1534">'''Kileken''' (sometimes ''Kileghen'') is the subject of a [[Mythology|myth]] of the [[Maasai people]] concerning the [[planet]] [[Venus]]. 

In the myth, the planet Venus is called Kileken, and visits the [[Earth]] in the form of a small boy. The boy befriends an old farmer and tends his [[cattle]], the man agreeing to let the boy keep the only thing he has: the secret of his origin. When the man betrays his trust and spies on Kileken, the boy vanishes in a bright light and returns to the heavens. The myth explains why the planet Venus is seen during the morning and evening. The [[oral tradition]] was captured in a book by the [[Tanzania]]-born author Tololwa M. Mollel.

In common with other societies, the Maasai believed Venus to be two separate bodies when seen at morning and in the evening. Kileken was the appearance of the 'morning star'. When it could be seen and the men had not yet returned from the hunt, the women would pray for their safekeeping. The 'evening star' was known as '''Leken''' and its appearance heralded the rising of the [[moon]].

'''''Les Bêtises''''' (''"The stupid things"'') is a 1971 novel by the French writer [[Jacques Laurent]]. It recounts 47 years in the life of an adventurous and well-travelled man, in the forms of his own notes, diary entries, an unfinished novel and comments, collected by a friend after the man's death. Laurent wrote the novel over a period of 22 years.&lt;ref name="Rambaud"&gt;{{Cite web|last=Rambaud|first=Patrick|authorlink=Patrick Rambaud|date=2003-07-17|url=http://www.lexpress.fr/informations/jacques-laurent-le-marginal_652573.html|title=Jacques Laurent, le marginal|language=French|work=[[L'Express]]|accessdate=2015-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The novel received the [[Prix Goncourt]], with five votes against four in the sixth voting round. It was also the first choice for the [[Prix Renaudot]], but the Renaudot can never go to the same book as the Goncourt, so the award went to the jury's second choice, ''Le Sac du palais d'été'' by [[Pierre-Jean Rémy]]. Although there are no political themes in ''Les Bêtises'', the Goncourt jury's decision proved controversial within the leftist press due to Laurent's right-wing sympathies, and journalists complained that there were no working-class people in the novel.&lt;ref name="Rambaud" /&gt;

'''Muluku''' is the creator god of the [[Benue–Congo]]-speaking [[Makua (people)|Makua]] and [[Banayi]] people of [[Mozambique]]. Muluku created men and women, and gave them the art of using tools, but the humans were disobedient. So Muluku called up [[monkey]] and she monkey. He gave them tools, and the monkeys used them well. So Muluku cut off the tails of the monkeys and fastened them to the man and the woman, saying to the monkeys, "Be men," and to the humans, "Be monkeys."

'''Ningwaphuma''' or Ningwaphumang (niŋwaphumaŋ) is the almighty [[god]] in [[Kirati people|Kirat]] [[mythology]], who first created the [[universe]] and [[Earth]], per this [[myth|story]]:

In the beginning, the earth was without form and void, and darkness was upon the face of the deep. In the middle of such darkness, a forceful power existed. He was the omnipresent God Almighty about whom nothing can be said.

Almighty God caused the creation of the small burning [[fire]], of the great light, of [[water]], and of [[wind]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3096">The '''''three-field system''''' is a regime of [[crop rotation]] that was used in medieval and early-modern [[Europe]].  Crop rotation is the practice of growing a series of different types of crops in the same area in sequential seasons. 

[[File:Three Field System.svg|thumb|400px|Three Field System with [[Ridge and furrow]]-Fields (Furlongs)]] 

The three field system let farmers plant more crops and therefore increase production. Under this system, the arable land of an estate or village was divided into three large [[Field (agriculture)|fields]]: one was planted in the autumn with [[Winter cereal|winter]] [[wheat]] or [[rye]]; the second field was planted with other crops such as [[pea]]s, [[lentil]]s, or [[bean]]s; and the third was left [[fallow]] (unplanted). [[Cereal]] crops deplete the ground of nitrogen, but legumes can [[nitrogen fixation|fix nitrogen]] and so fertilize the soil. The fallow fields were soon overgrown with weeds and used for grazing farm animals. Their excrement fertilized that field's soil to regain its nutrients. Crop assignments were rotated every year, so each field segment would be planted for two out of every three years. 

Previously a "two field system" had been in place, with half the land being left fallow.  With more crops available to sell and agriculture dominating the economy at the time, the three-field system created a significant surplus and increased economic prosperity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Noble | first = Thomas | title = The foundations of Western civilization | publisher = Teaching Co | location = Chantilly, VA | year = 2002 |chapter-format=33| isbn = 978-1565856370 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The three field system needed more plowing of land and its introduction coincided with the adoption of the [[moldboard plow]]. These parallel developments complemented each other and increased agricultural productivity. The legume crop needed summer rain to succeed, and so the three-field system was less successful around the Mediterranean. [[Oats]] for horse food could also be planted in the spring, which, combined with the adoption of [[horse collar]]s and [[horseshoe]]s, led to replacement of oxen by horses for many farming tasks, with a concomitant increase in agricultural productivity and the nutrition available to the population.&lt;ref&gt;Wigelsworth, Jeffrey R. (2006). ''Science and technology in medieval European life''. Greenwood Publishing Group. p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the first Germans to question this system, and new ways of expanding beyond this medieval system was [[Johann Friedrich Mayer (agriculturist)|Johann Friedrich Mayer]], in his 1769 work ''Lehre vom Gyps als vorzueglich guten Dung zu allen Erd-Gewaechsen auf Aeckern und Wiesen, Hopfen- und Weinbergen''.&lt;ref&gt;Roeber, A. G. (1998). ''Palatines, Liberty, and Property: German Lutherans in Colonial German America''. p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''World Football Daily''''' (formerly known as '''''World Soccer Daily''''' and '''''World Soccer Weekly''''') was a sports radio talk show hosted by Martin Rogers and Sophie Nicolaou. The show broadcasts live on the show's official website, WorldFootballDaily.com, Monday through Friday 9&amp;ndash;11 a.m, [[Pacific Time Zone|PST]], and is later made available as a podcast. The show is streamed online live in both a video or audio-only format, and the live audio feed is given away free. When known as ''World Soccer Daily'', it aired live on weekdays 10:00 a.m.&amp;ndash;12:00 p.m. PST on [[Sirius Satellite Radio|Sirius]] Channel 125. After the show left Sirius in August 2009, it returned as a web-only, subscription-based show through the show's official website.

The hosts discuss a broad range of topics related to [[association football]]. The primary topics discussed include the [[Premier League]]; [[UEFA Champions League]]; [[FIFA World Cup]], including [[FIFA World Cup qualification|qualification]]; [[United States men's national soccer team]], and [[England national football team]].

==History of the show==

===World Soccer Daily===

In 2002, Steven Cohen and [[Nick Geber]] founded Soccer Weekly Inc, with Cohen acting as CEO and Geber as President. The two began hosting ''World Soccer Weekly'' on [[Fox Sports Radio]] in Los Angeles, California. As the show grew into new markets and became a weekly show the name was eventually re-titled ''World Soccer Daily''. On February 26, 2007, it was announced on air that sometime in April 2007 Geber would be leaving the show in order to pursue other projects, including an expanded format for his current [[Bluff (magazine)|Bluff Magazine]] [[poker]] radio program. It was announced at the time that he would instead become the first option fill-in host, while Howard Rogers, the previous first option fill-in host, would be taking over Nick's duties as full-time co-host.

In March 2007, Cohen and Geber were featured in [[FourFourTwo]], a [[United Kingdom|British]] association football magazine. They were also in the Australian and American edition. The radio show is the top soccer-related show in [[North America]], and at one point was one of the top 10 most popular sports [[podcast]]s on [[iTunes]].

On February 5, 2008, Steven parted ways with Howard Rogers. [[Kenny Hassan]] replaced Rogers as co-host.

===Controversy and cancellation===

Host Steven Cohen has faced criticism as a result of statements he has made in regards to the [[Hillsborough disaster]] in which he stated that the [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] fans were the root cause and perpetrators of the incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Cohen's lies |url=http://boycottstevencohen.webs.com/cohenslies.htm |year=2009 |accessdate=October 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; This sparked a boycott of the show as well as a letter-writing campaign to the shows sponsors by certain Liverpool supporters groups.&lt;ref name="North American LFC Fan Club Official Boycott"&gt;[http://www.redandwhitekop.com/forum/index.php?topic=242230.0], North American LFC Fan Club Official Boycott&lt;/ref&gt; Cohen cancelled World Soccer Daily on August 21, 2009.

===World Football Daily===

On August 27, 2009 it was announced via their web site that World Football Daily would launch on August 31, 2009 as a new program. The new format for the show was launched with the intent to "change the way football is discussed by bringing a football show of the people, for the people and by the people straight to the people"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldfootballdaily.com/|title=World Football Daily - The Only Daily Soccer Show in America|last=Solutions|first=Nox|website=World Football Daily|access-date=2018-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show is now run on a subscription service.

The change to the subscription service brought a different format than that of World Soccer Daily. World Football Daily became much more guest oriented bringing in the top journalists from around the globe to fulfill the "World" aspect of the game in their title. They have also brought on many players and managers from the Barclay's Premier League including the likes of [[Harry Redknapp]], [[Roberto Martínez]], [[Chris Hughton]], [[Mick McCarthy]], [[Alan Smith (footballer born 1962)|Alan Smith]], [[Micah Richards]], and [[Shay Given]], just to name a few.

World Football Daily has also brought an expansive coverage of the domestic game in the United States. They regularly have guests from [[Major League Soccer]] and the United States Men's National Team. They have brought on all major U.S. players including -- [[Clint Dempsey]], [[Charlie Davies]], [[Brad Guzan]], [[Brek Shea]], [[Jay DeMerit]], and many more.

The show still regularly takes calls from its fans around the world in addition to bringing on the top guests from the world's game.

===Change of Hosts===

[[Steven Cohen (soccer)|Steven Cohen]] left the show due to personal reasons on April 1, 2011.  Kenny Hassan left the show due to personal reasons in late 2011.  The show continued with co-host replacements, Robert Burns and Sophie Nicolaou.  The pair continued together for just over one month then it was announced on October 27, 2011 that Martin Rogers of [[Yahoo!]] Sports would take the lead hosting position. Rogers permanently took the lead-host role on November 1, 2011 replacing Robert Burns, leaving the co-host position to Nicolaou.

==Show personnel==

===Current===

* Rafael Gonzales - Producer/Host

In addition to the show's regular staff and hosts, a number of guests often make appearances as fill-in hosts. Guest hosts of the past include former full-time WSD host [[Nick Geber]], ESPN's Georgie Bingham, Howard Rogers, Sir Harvey Cohen (Steven's father) and [[Fox Soccer|Fox Soccer Channel's]] Nick Webster.

===Guests and correspondents===

In early 2008, World Soccer Daily increased the frequency of guest appearances on the show. These guests include:
* football commentator [[Martin Tyler]]
* football pundit [[Robbie Earle]]
* Fox Soccer Channel's [[Bobby McMahon]]
* ESPN's commentator [[Derek Rae]]
* Setanta Sports commentator [[Pat Dolan]]
* Daniel King of London's [[Daily Mail]]
* International referee [[Graham Poll]]

And in an effort live up to its name and expand its coverage beyond the Premier League, the show has brought on a number of regular foreign correspondents. These include:
* [[Phil Ball (writer)|Phil Ball]] from [[San Sebastián]], [[Spain]]
* [[Tim Vickery]] who covers South America for [[BBC Sport]]
* [[Sayed Otaru]] of [[Nigeria]]
* Andy Brassell who covers Europe
* Goal.com's Alex Labidou and Eric Gomez, of the USA and US Latino editions, respectively
