On March 16, 2004, an [[explosion]] destroyed a corner section of a nine-story [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]-era apartment building in [[Arkhangelsk, Russia]]. It happened at 3:03&amp;nbsp;a.m. local time ([[UTC]] +3).  The explosion occurred in 120 Avenue of the Soviet Cosmonauts in the October district (''Oktyabrskiy rayon'')  of Arkhangelsk.

The death toll from the explosion was 58 (33 women, 16 men and 9 children).  At least 2 of the dead died in a [[hospital]] after being rescued.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3522832.stm|title=BBC NEWS - Europe - Search abandoned in Russia rubble|author=|date=|work=bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The explosion came two days after [[Vladimir Putin]] won [[Russian presidential election, 2004|reelection]] and several weeks after a [[suicide bombing]] killed 41 [[Moscow]] [[rapid transit|subway]] passengers.

In April 2004, authorities arrested and charged 26-year-old former employee of city gas services Sergey Alekseychik. On December 16, 2005 he was sentenced to 25 years in prison. According to the official version, Alekseychik was fired from his natural gas technician job several days prior to the explosion, and to get even with his former employers and the city he sabotaged the gas system thus causing the tragedy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Мстиславская|first1=Мария|title=Заслуживает снисхождения : Обвиненного во взрыве дома в Архангельске приговорили к 25 годам колонии|url=https://lenta.ru/articles/2005/12/16/gas1/|accessdate=1 June 2017|publisher=Lenta.ru|date=15 December 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Agriculture in Concert with the Environment''' ('''ACE''') is a program of the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA), administered cooperatively with [[United States Department of Agriculture]]'s [[Sustainable Agriculture Research and Education]] (SARE) program, to fund [[research project]]s that reduce the risk of [[pollution]] from [[pesticide]]s and [[soluble]] [[fertilizer]]s.

==Origins==

In 1991, the EPA partnered with the USDA through the Low-Input Sustainable Agriculture Program (LISA), now referred to as the SARE, and allotted a budget of $1,000,000 to the program. The LISA program pledged to match funds received from the EPA dollar for dollar each year.&lt;ref name=TheEarlyYears&gt;{{cite web|last1=Madden|first1=J. Patrick|title=The Early Years|url=http://www.sare.org/About-SARE/Historical-Timeline|website=Historical Timeline|publisher=Sustainable Agriculture Research &amp; Education|accessdate=18 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission==
The ACE program was created to aid in the prevention and reduction of agricultural pollution. To achieve this, the program created 3 main goals: 
*  to reduce the use of pesticides and fertilizers in agricultural practices
* to promote the implementation of nutrient management planning and use of reduced-risk pesticides and biological controls
* to protect ecologically sensitive areas&lt;ref name=TheEarlyYears /&gt;

'''Flight mechanics''' are relevant to fixed wing ([[Glider aircraft|gliders]], [[aeroplane]]s) and rotary wing ([[helicopter]]s) aircraft. An aeroplane (''airplane'' in US usage), is defined in [[International Civil Aviation Organization|ICAO]] Document 9110 as, "a power-driven heavier than air aircraft, deriving its lift chiefly from aerodynamic reactions on surface which remain fixed under given conditions of flight".

== Take-off==
A heavier-than-air craft (aircraft) can only fly if a series of aerodynamic forces come to bear. In regard to fixed wing aircraft, the fuselage of the craft holds up the wings before takeoff. At the instant of takeoff, the reverse happens and the wings support the plane in flight.

== Straight and level flight of aircraft==
{{Further|Steady flight#Steady Flight Maneuvers}}

In flight an aircraft can be considered as being acted on by four forces: [[lift (force)|lift]], [[weight]], [[thrust]], and [[drag (physics)|drag]].&lt;ref&gt;Clancy, L.J., ''Aerodynamics'', Section 14.2&lt;/ref&gt; ''Thrust'' is the force generated by the engine (whether it be a [[jet engine|jet]] or a [[propeller]] driven craft) and acts along the engine's thrust vector for the purpose of overcoming drag.&lt;ref&gt;Stollery, J. L., ''Flight Mechanics of High Performance Aircraft'', Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, suppl. Part G211.2 (1997): 129&lt;/ref&gt; ''Lift'' acts perpendicular to the vector representing the aircraft's velocity relative to the atmosphere. ''Drag'' acts parallel to the aircraft's velocity vector, but in the opposite direction because drag resists motion through the air. ''Weight'' acts through the [[Center of gravity (aircraft)|aircraft's centre of gravity]], towards the center of the earth.

In straight and level [[flight]],(or movement in the air) lift is approximately equal and opposite to weight.  In addition, if the [[aircraft]] is not accelerating, thrust is equal and opposite to drag.&lt;ref&gt;Clancy, L.J., ''Aerodynamics'', Figure 14.1&lt;/ref&gt;

In straight climbing flight, lift is less than weight.&lt;ref&gt;Clancy, L.J., ''Aerodynamics'', Section 14.5&lt;/ref&gt;  At first, this seems incorrect because if an aircraft is climbing it seems lift must exceed weight. When an aircraft is climbing at constant speed it is its thrust that enables it to climb and gain extra potential energy. Lift acts perpendicular to the vector representing the velocity of the aircraft relative to the atmosphere, so lift is unable to alter the aircraft's potential energy or kinetic energy. This can be seen by considering an aerobatic aircraft in straight vertical flight—one that is climbing straight upwards (or descending straight downwards). Vertical flight requires no lift. When flying straight upwards the aircraft can reach zero airspeed before falling earthwards—the wing is generating no lift and so does not stall. In straight, climbing flight at constant airspeed, thrust exceeds drag.

In straight descending flight, lift is less than weight.&lt;ref&gt;Clancy, L.J., ''Aerodynamics'', Section 14.4&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, if the aircraft is not accelerating, thrust is less than drag. In turning flight, lift exceeds weight and produces a [[load factor (aeronautics)|load factor]] greater than one, determined by the aircraft's [[angle of bank]].&lt;ref&gt;Clancy, L.J., ''Aerodynamics'', Section 14.6&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aircraft control and movement ==
{{main article|Flight dynamics (fixed-wing aircraft)}}
There are three primary ways for an aircraft to change its orientation relative to the passing air. ''Pitch'' (movement of the nose up or down, rotation around the transversal axis), ''roll'' (rotation around the longitudinal axis, that is, the axis which runs along the length of the aircraft) and ''yaw'' (movement of the nose to left or right, rotation about the vertical axis). Turning the aircraft (change of heading) requires the aircraft firstly to roll to achieve an angle of bank (in order to balance the centrifugal force); when the desired change of heading has been accomplished the aircraft must again be rolled in the opposite direction to reduce the angle of bank to zero. Lift acts vertically up through center of pressure which depends on the position of wings. The position of the centre of pressure which will change with changes in the angle of attack and aircraft wing flaps setting.

== Aircraft control surfaces ==
{{main article|Flight control surfaces}}
Yaw is induced by a moveable rudder-fin. The movement of the rudder changes the size and orientation of the force the vertical surface produces. Since the force is created at a distance behind the centre of gravity, this sideways force causes a yawing moment then a yawing motion. On a large aircraft there may be several independent rudders on the single fin for both safety and to control the inter-linked yaw and roll actions.

Using yaw alone is not a very efficient way of executing a level turn in an aircraft and will result in some sideslip. A precise combination of bank and lift must be generated to cause the required centripetal forces without producing a sideslip.

Pitch is controlled by the rear part of the [[tailplane]]'s horizontal stabilizer being hinged to create an [[Elevator (aircraft)|elevator]]. By moving the elevator control backwards the pilot moves the elevator up (a position of negative camber) and the downwards force on the horizontal tail is increased. The [[angle of attack]] on the [[wing]]s increased so the nose is pitched up and lift is generally increased. In micro-lights and [[hang glider]]s the pitch action is reversed—the pitch control system is much simpler so when the pilot moves the elevator control backwards it produces a nose-down pitch and the angle of attack on the wing is reduced.

The system of a fixed tail surface and moveable elevators is standard in subsonic aircraft. Craft capable of supersonic flight often have a [[stabilator]], an all-moving tail surface. Pitch is changed in this case by moving the entire horizontal surface of the tail. This seemingly simple innovation was one of the key technologies that made supersonic flight possible. In early attempts, as pilots exceeded the [[critical Mach number]], a strange phenomenon made their control surfaces useless, and their aircraft uncontrollable. It was determined that as an aircraft approaches the speed of sound, the air approaching the aircraft is compressed and shock waves begin to form at all the leading edges and around the hinge lines of the elevator. These shock waves caused movements of the elevator to cause no pressure change on the stabilizer upstream of the elevator. The problem was solved by changing the stabilizer and hinged elevator to an all-moving stabilizer—the entire horizontal surface of the tail became a one-piece control surface. Also, in supersonic flight the change in camber has less effect on lift and a stabilator produces less drag{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}.

Aircraft that need control at extreme angles of attack are sometimes fitted with a [[canard (aeronautics)|canard]] configuration, in which pitching movement is created using a forward foreplane (roughly level with the cockpit). Such a system produces an immediate increase in pitch authority, and therefore a better response to pitch controls. This system is common in delta-wing aircraft (deltaplane), which use a stabilator-type canard foreplane. A disadvantage to a canard configuration compared to an aft tail is that the wing cannot use as much extension of flaps to increase wing lift at slow speeds due to stall performance. A combination tri-surface aircraft uses both a canard and an aft tail (in addition to the main wing) to achieve advantages of both configurations.

A further design of tailplane is the [[V-tail]], so named because that instead of the standard inverted T or T-tail, there are two fins angled away from each other in a V. The control surfaces then act both as rudders and elevators, moving in the appropriate direction as needed. 

Roll is controlled by movable sections on the trailing edge of the wings called [[aileron]]s. The ailerons move in opposition to one another—one goes up as the other goes down. The difference in camber of the wing cause a difference in lift and thus a rolling movement. As well as ailerons, there are sometimes also [[spoiler (aeronautics)|spoiler]]s—small hinged plates on the upper surface of the wing, originally used to produce drag to slow the aircraft down and to reduce lift when descending. On modern aircraft, which have the benefit of automation, they can be used in combination with the ailerons to provide roll control.

The earliest powered aircraft built by the [[Wright brothers]] did not have ailerons. The whole wing was warped using wires. Wing warping is efficient since there is no discontinuity in the wing geometry. But as speeds increased unintentional warping became a problem and so ailerons were developed.

'''Amino acids''' are [[organic compound]]s containing [[amine]] (-NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[Carboxylic acid|carboxyl]] (-COOH) [[functional group]]s, along with a [[Substituent|side chain]] (R group) specific to each amino acid.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|title = Amino|date = 2015|encyclopedia = Dictionary.com|url = http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/amino|accessdate = 3 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|title = amino acid|date = 2015|encyclopedia = Cambridge Dictionaries Online|publisher = Cambridge University Press|url = https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/british/amino-acid|accessdate = 3 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|title = amino|date = 2015|publisher = Farlex|url = http://www.thefreedictionary.com/amino|accessdate = 3 July 2015|encyclopedia = FreeDictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The key [[Chemical element|elements]] of an amino acid are [[carbon]] (C), [[hydrogen]] (H), [[oxygen]] (O), and [[nitrogen]] (N), although other elements are found in the side chains of certain amino acids. About 500 naturally occurring amino acids are known (though only 20 appear in the [[genetic code]]) and can be classified in many ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title = New Naturally Occurring Amino Acids|vauthors = Wagner I, Musso H|doi = 10.1002/anie.198308161|journal = [[Angewandte Chemie International Edition in English]]|volume = 22|issue = 11|pages = 816–28|date = November 1983}}{{Closed access}}&lt;/ref&gt; They can be classified according to the core structural functional groups' locations as [[Alpha and beta carbon|alpha- &lt;span style="white-space: nowrap"&gt;(α-)&lt;/span&gt;, beta- &lt;span style="white-space: nowrap"&gt;(β-)&lt;/span&gt;, gamma- &lt;span style="white-space: nowrap"&gt;(γ-)&lt;/span&gt; or delta- &lt;span style="white-space: nowrap"&gt;(δ-)&lt;/span&gt;]] amino acids; other categories relate to [[Chemical polarity|polarity]], [[pH]] level, and side chain group type ([[aliphatic]], [[Open-chain compound|acyclic]], [[aromatic]], containing [[Hydroxy group|hydroxyl]] or [[sulfur]], etc.).

In [[biochemistry]], amino acids having both the amine and the carboxylic acid groups attached to the [[alpha-carbon|first (alpha-) carbon]] atom have particular importance. They are known as '''2-, alpha-,''' or '''α-amino acids''' (generic [[Chemical formula|formula]] H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;NCHRCOOH in most cases,&lt;ref&gt;[[Proline]] is an exception to this general formula.

Twenty of the proteinogenic amino acids are encoded directly by triplet [[codon]]s in the [[genetic code]] and are known as "standard" amino acids. The other two ("non-standard" or "non-canonical") are [[selenocysteine]] (present in many [[prokaryote]]s as well as most [[eukaryote]]s, but not coded directly by [[DNA]]), and [[pyrrolysine]] (found only in some [[archea]] and one [[bacterium]]). Pyrrolysine and selenocysteine are encoded via variant codons; for example, selenocysteine is encoded by [[stop codon]] and [[SECIS element]].&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=BDn-AI_YBlMC&amp;pg=PA1&amp;lpg=PA1 Modeling Electrostatic Contributions to Protein Folding and Binding] – Tjong, p.1 footnote&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="VoJw6fIISSkC p.299"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=VoJw6fIISSkC&amp;pg=PA299&amp;lpg=PA299 Frontiers in Drug Design and Discovery] ed.

Many important proteinogenic and non-proteinogenic amino acids have biological functions. For example, in the [[human brain]], glutamate (standard [[glutamic acid]]) and [[gamma-amino-butyric acid]] ("GABA", non-standard gamma-amino acid) are, respectively, the main [[Neurotransmitter#Excitatory and inhibitory|excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters]].&lt;ref name="pmid12467378"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Petroff OA | title = GABA and glutamate in the human brain | journal = The Neuroscientist | volume = 8 | issue = 6 | pages = 562–73 | date = December 2002 | pmid = 12467378 | doi = 10.1177/1073858402238515 | url = http://nro.sagepub.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=12467378 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hydroxyproline]], a major component of the [[connective tissue]] [[collagen]], is synthesised from [[proline]]. [[Glycine]] is a biosynthetic precursor to porphyrins used in [[red blood cell]]s. [[Carnitine]] is used in [[lipid|lipid transport]].

Nine proteinogenic amino acids are called "[[essential amino acid|essential]]" for humans because they cannot be produced from other [[chemical compound|compounds]] by the human body and so must be taken in as food. Others may be [[Essential amino acid#Essentiality vs. conditional essentiality in humans|conditionally essential]] for certain ages or medical conditions. Essential amino acids may also differ between [[species]].&lt;ref&gt;For example, [[ruminant]]s such as cows obtain a number of amino acids via [[microbe]]s in the [[reticulorumen|first two stomach chambers]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of their biological significance, amino acids are important in nutrition and are commonly used in [[nutritional supplement]]s, [[fertilizer]]s, [[animal feed|feed]], and [[food technology]]. Industrial uses include the production of [[Pharmaceutical drug|drugs]], [[biodegradable plastic]]s, and [[asymmetric catalysis|chiral catalysts]].

The unity of the chemical category was recognized by [[Charles Adolphe Wurtz|Wurtz]] in 1865, but he gave no particular name to it.&lt;ref&gt;Menten, P. ''Dictionnaire de chimie: Une approche étymologique et historique''. De Boeck, Bruxelles. [https://books.google.com/books?id=NKTKDgAAQBAJ link].&lt;/ref&gt; Usage of the term "amino acid" in the English language is from 1898,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = https://www.etymonline.com/word/amino- | publisher = www.etymonline.com | title = etymonline.com entry for ''amino'' | accessdate = 19 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the German term, ''Aminosäure'', was used earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Paal C | year = 1894 | title = Ueber die Einwirkung von Phenyl‐i‐cyanat auf organische Aminosäuren | url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cber.189402701205/full | journal = Berichte der deutschen chemischen Gesellschaft | volume = 27 | issue = | pages = 974–979 | doi=10.1002/cber.189402701205}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proteins were found to yield amino acids after enzymatic digestion or acid [[hydrolysis]]. In 1902, [[Hermann Emil Fischer|Emil Fischer]] and [[Franz Hofmeister]] independently proposed that proteins are formed from many amino acids, whereby bonds are formed between the amino group of one amino acid with the carboxyl group of another, resulting in a linear structure that Fischer termed "[[peptide]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = Joseph S. | last = Fruton | name-list-format = vanc | title = Contrasts in Scientific Style: Research Groups in the Chemical and Biochemical Sciences, |volume=191 |year=1990 |chapter=Chapter 5- Emil Fischer and Franz Hofmeister |pages=163–165 |publisher=American Philosophical Society |isbn=0-87169-191-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the structure shown at the top of the page, '''R''' represents a [[Substituent|side chain]] specific to each amino acid. The [[carbon]] atom next to the [[carboxyl group]] (which is therefore numbered 2 in the [[carbon chain]] starting from that functional group) is called the [[alpha carbon|α–carbon]].  Amino acids containing an [[amino group]] bonded directly to the alpha carbon are referred to as ''alpha amino acids''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/medical/alpha-amino%20acid|title=Alpha amino acid – Medical definition|publisher=Merriam-Webster dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These include amino acids such as [[proline]] which contain [[secondary amine]]s, which used to be often referred to as "imino acids".&lt;ref&gt;{{MeshName|Proline}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://opbs.okstate.edu/5753/Amino%20Acids.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=3 January 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080118064634/http://opbs.okstate.edu/5753/Amino%20Acids.html |archivedate=18 January 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=goldbook&gt;{{GoldBookRef|file=I02959|title=Imino acids|accessdate=2 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Isomerism===

The alpha amino acids are the most common form found in nature, but only when occurring in the &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-isomer. The alpha carbon is a [[chirality (chemistry)|chiral]] carbon atom, with the exception of [[glycine]] which has two indistinguishable hydrogen atoms on the alpha carbon.&lt;ref name="Creighton"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Creighton |first=Thomas H. | name-list-format = vanc |title=Proteins: structures and molecular properties |publisher=W.

Freeman |location=San Francisco |year=1993 |chapter=Chapter 1 |isbn=978-0-7167-7030-5 |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Therefore, all alpha amino acids but [[glycine]] can exist in either of two [[enantiomer]]s, called &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt; or &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt; amino acids, which are mirror images of each other (''see also [[Chirality (chemistry)|Chirality]]''). While &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-amino acids represent all of the amino acids found in [[protein]]s during translation in the ribosome, &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;-amino acids are found in some proteins produced by enzyme [[posttranslational modification]]s after [[Translation (biology)|translation]] and [[Translocation (genetics)|translocation]] to the [[endoplasmic reticulum]], as in exotic sea-dwelling organisms such as [[cone snail]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pisarewicz K, Mora D, Pflueger FC, Fields GB, Marí F | title = Polypeptide chains containing D-gamma-hydroxyvaline | journal = Journal of the American Chemical Society | volume = 127 | issue = 17 | pages = 6207–15 | date = May 2005 | pmid = 15853325 | doi = 10.1021/ja050088m }}&lt;/ref&gt; They are also abundant components of the [[peptidoglycan]] [[cell wall]]s of bacteria,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = van Heijenoort J | title = Formation of the glycan chains in the synthesis of bacterial peptidoglycan | journal = Glycobiology | volume = 11 | issue = 3 | pages = 25R–36R | date = March 2001 | pmid = 11320055 | doi = 10.1093/glycob/11.3.25R }}&lt;/ref&gt; and &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;-serine may act as a [[neurotransmitter]] in the brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wolosker H, Dumin E, Balan L, Foltyn VN | title = D-amino acids in the brain: D-serine in neurotransmission and neurodegeneration | journal = The FEBS Journal | volume = 275 | issue = 14 | pages = 3514–26 | date = July 2008 | pmid = 18564180 | doi = 10.1111/j.1742-4658.2008.06515.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;-amino acids are used in [[racemic crystallography]] to create centrosymmetric crystals, which (depending on the protein) may allow for easier and more robust protein structure determination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Matthews BW | title =  Racemic crystallography—easy crystals and easy structures: What's not to like? | journal = Protein Science | volume = 18 | issue = 6 | pages = 1135–8 | date = June 2009 | pmid = 19472321 | pmc = 2774423 | doi = 10.1002/pro.125 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt; and &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt; convention for amino acid configuration refers not to the optical activity of the amino acid itself but rather to the optical activity of the isomer of [[glyceraldehyde]] from which that amino acid can, in theory, be synthesized (&lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;-glyceraldehyde is dextrorotatory; &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-glyceraldehyde is levorotatory).
In alternative fashion, the [[Cahn–Ingold–Prelog priority rules|''(S)'' and ''(R)'' designators]] are used to indicate the absolute [[stereochemistry]]. Almost all of the amino acids in proteins are ''(S)'' at the α carbon, with cysteine being ''(R)'' and glycine non-[[Chirality|chiral]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Hatem | first = Salama Mohamed Ali | year = 2006 | url = http://geb.uni-giessen.de/geb/volltexte/2006/3038/index.html | title = Gas chromatographic determination of Amino Acid Enantiomers in tobacco and bottled wines | publisher = University of Giessen | accessdate = 17 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cysteine has its side chain in the same geometric position as the other amino acids, but the ''R/S'' terminology is reversed because of the higher atomic number of [[sulfur]] compared to the carboxyl oxygen gives the side chain a higher priority, whereas the atoms in most other side chains give them lower priority.

===Side chains===
[[File:Lysine fisher structure and 3d ball.svg|thumb|right|[[Lysine]] with carbon atoms labeled by position]]

Amino acids are usually classified by the [[chemical property|properties]] of their side chain into four groups. The side chain can make an amino acid a [[weak acid]] or a [[weak base]], and a [[hydrophile]] if the side chain is [[polar molecule|polar]] or a [[hydrophobe]] if it is [[nonpolar]].&lt;ref name="Creighton" /&gt; The [[chemical structure]]s of the 22 standard amino acids, along with their chemical properties, are described more fully in the article on these [[proteinogenic amino acid]]s.

[[Proline]] is the only [[proteinogenic]] amino acid whose side-group links to the α-amino group and, thus, is also the only proteinogenic amino acid containing a secondary amine at this position.&lt;ref name="Creighton" /&gt; In chemical terms, proline is, therefore, an [[imino acid]], since it lacks a [[amine|primary amino group]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1021/ja01414a033 | volume = 48 | issue = 3 | pages = 751–753 | last = Jodidi | first = S.

===Zwitterions===
[[File:Amino acid zwitterions.svg |thumb|right|An amino acid in its (1) un-ionized and (2) zwitterionic forms]]
{{main|Zwitterion}}
The α-[[carboxylic acid]] group of amino acids is a [[weak acid]], meaning that it releases a [[Hydron (chemistry)|hydron]] (such as a [[proton]]) at moderate pH values.  In other words, carboxylic acid groups (−CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H) can be [[deprotonated]] to become negative [[carboxylate]]s (−CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; ).  The negatively charged carboxylate ion predominates at pH values greater than the [[pKa]] of the carboxylic acid group (mean for the 20 common amino acids is about 2.2, see the table of amino acid structures above).  In a complementary fashion, the α-[[amine]] of amino acids is a [[weak base]], meaning that it accepts a proton at moderate pH values.  In other words, α-amino groups (NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;−) can be [[protonated]] to become positive α-ammonium groups (&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;−).  The positively charged α-ammonium group predominates at pH values less than the pKa of the α-ammonium group (mean for the 20 common α-amino acids is about 9.4).

Because all amino acids contain amine and carboxylic acid functional groups, they share [[Amphoterism|amphiprotic]] properties.&lt;ref name="Creighton" /&gt;  Below pH 2.2, the predominant form will have a neutral carboxylic acid group and a positive α-ammonium ion (net charge +1), and above pH 9.4, a negative carboxylate and neutral α-amino group (net charge −1).  But at pH between 2.2 and 9.4, an amino acid usually contains both a negative carboxylate and a positive α-ammonium group, as shown in structure (2) on the right, so has net zero charge.  This molecular state is known as a [[zwitterion]], from the German '''Zwitter''' meaning ''hermaphrodite'' or ''hybrid''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Simmons | first1 = William J. | first2 = Gerhard | last2 = Meisenberg | name-list-format = vanc | title = Principles of medical biochemistry |publisher=Mosby Elsevier |location= |year=2006 |isbn=0-323-02942-6 |oclc= |page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The fully neutral form (structure (1) on the left) is a very minor species in aqueous solution throughout the pH range (less than 1 part in 10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;). Amino acids exist as zwitterions also in the solid phase, and crystallize with salt-like properties unlike typical organic acids or amines.

===Isoelectric point===
[[File:Amino Acid Titration Curves By Side Chain.png|thumb|right|360px|Composite of [[titration curve]]s of twenty proteinogenic amino acids grouped by side chain category]]

The variation in titration curves when the amino acids can be grouped by category.{{clarify|issue=By eye, polar-uncharged, hydrophobic, and special-case curve-sets all look the same, but one AA in each of them looks different.|date=August 2017}} With the exception of tyrosine, using titration to distinguish among hydrophobic amino acids is problematic.

At pH values between the two pKa values, the zwitterion predominates, but coexists in [[dynamic equilibrium]] with small amounts of net negative and net positive ions. At the exact midpoint between the two pKa values, the trace amount of net negative and trace of net positive ions exactly balance, so that average net charge of all forms present is zero.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Fennema OR |title=Food Chemistry 3rd Ed |publisher=CRC Press |location= |pages=327–8 |isbn=0-8247-9691-8 |oclc= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This pH is known as the [[isoelectric point]] pI, so pI = ½(pKa&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + pKa&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). The individual amino acids all have slightly different pKa values, so have different isoelectric points. For amino acids with charged side chains, the pKa of the side chain is involved. Thus for Asp, Glu with negative side chains, pI = ½(pKa&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + pKa&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;), where pKa&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; is the side chain pKa. Cysteine also has potentially negative side chain with pKa&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; = 8.14, so pI should be calculated as for Asp and Glu, even though the side chain is not significantly charged at neutral pH. For His, Lys, and Arg with positive side chains, pI = ½(pKa&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; + pKa&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). Amino acids have zero mobility in electrophoresis at their isoelectric point, although this behaviour is more usually exploited for peptides and proteins than single amino acids. Zwitterions have minimum solubility at their isoelectric point and some amino acids (in particular, with non-polar side chains) can be isolated by precipitation from water by adjusting the pH to the required isoelectric point.

===Proteinogenic amino acids===
{{main|Proteinogenic amino acids}} {{See also|Protein primary structure|Posttranslational modification}}

Amino acids are the structural units (monomers) that make up proteins. They join together to form short [[polymer]] chains called [[peptide]]s or longer chains called either [[polypeptides]] or [[protein]]s. These polymers are linear and unbranched, with each amino acid within the chain attached to two neighboring amino acids. The process of making proteins encoded by DNA/RNA genetic material is called ''[[translation (biology)|translation]]'' and involves the step-by-step addition of amino acids to a growing protein chain by a [[ribozyme]] that is called a [[ribosome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rodnina MV, Beringer M, Wintermeyer W | title = How ribosomes make peptide bonds | journal = Trends in Biochemical Sciences | volume = 32 | issue = 1 | pages = 20–6 | date = January 2007 | pmid = 17157507 | doi = 10.1016/j.tibs.2006.11.007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The order in which the amino acids are added is read through the [[genetic code]] from an [[Messenger RNA|mRNA]] template, which is an [[RNA]] copy of one of the organism's [[gene]]s.

Twenty-two amino acids are naturally incorporated into polypeptides and are called [[proteinogenic]] or natural amino acids.&lt;ref name="Creighton" /&gt; Of these, 20 are encoded by the universal [[genetic code]]. The remaining 2, [[selenocysteine]] and [[pyrrolysine]], are incorporated into proteins by unique synthetic mechanisms. [[Selenocysteine]] is incorporated when the mRNA being translated includes a [[SECIS element]], which causes the UGA codon to encode selenocysteine instead of a [[stop codon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Driscoll DM, Copeland PR | title = Mechanism and regulation of selenoprotein synthesis | journal = Annual Review of Nutrition | volume = 23 | issue = 1 | pages = 17–40 | year = 2003 | pmid = 12524431 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.nutr.23.011702.073318 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pyrrolysine]] is used by some [[methanogen]]ic [[archaea]] in enzymes that they use to produce [[methane]]. It is coded for with the codon UAG, which is normally a stop codon in other organisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Krzycki JA | title = The direct genetic encoding of pyrrolysine | journal = Current Opinion in Microbiology | volume = 8 | issue = 6 | pages = 706–12 | date = December 2005 | pmid = 16256420 | doi = 10.1016/j.mib.2005.10.009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This UAG codon is followed by a [[PYLIS downstream sequence]].&lt;ref name="pmid16164991"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Théobald-Dietrich A, Giegé R, Rudinger-Thirion J | title = Evidence for the existence in mRNAs of a hairpin element responsible for ribosome dependent pyrrolysine insertion into proteins | journal = Biochimie | volume = 87 | issue = 9–10 | pages = 813–7 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16164991 | doi = 10.1016/j.biochi.2005.03.006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-proteinogenic amino acids===
{{main|Non-proteinogenic amino acids}}

Aside from the 22 [[proteinogenic amino acid]]s, many ''non-proteinogenic'' amino acids are known. Those either are not found in proteins (for example [[carnitine]], [[Gamma-aminobutyric acid|GABA]], [[levothyroxine]]) or are not produced directly and in isolation by standard cellular machinery (for example, [[hydroxyproline]] and [[selenomethionine]]).

Non-proteinogenic amino acids that are found in proteins are formed by [[post-translational modification]], which is modification after translation during protein synthesis. These modifications are often essential for the function or regulation of a protein.  For example, the [[carboxylation]] of [[glutamate]] allows for better binding of [[calcium in biology|calcium cations]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Vermeer C | title = Gamma-carboxyglutamate-containing proteins and the vitamin K-dependent carboxylase | journal = The Biochemical Journal | volume = 266 | issue = 3 | pages = 625–36 | date = March 1990 | pmid = 2183788 | pmc = 1131186 | doi = 10.1042/bj2660625 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and  [[collagen]] contains hydroxyproline, generated by [[hydroxylation]] of [[proline]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bhattacharjee A, Bansal M | title = Collagen structure: the Madras triple helix and the current scenario | journal = IUBMB Life | volume = 57 | issue = 3 | pages = 161–72 | date = March 2005 | pmid = 16036578 | doi = 10.1080/15216540500090710 | url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1080/15216540500090710/pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example is the formation of [[hypusine]] in the [[Eukaryotic initiation factor|translation initiation factor]] [[EIF5A]], through modification of a lysine residue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Park MH | title = The post-translational synthesis of a polyamine-derived amino acid, hypusine, in the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A (eIF5A) | journal = Journal of Biochemistry | volume = 139 | issue = 2 | pages = 161–9 | date = February 2006 | pmid = 16452303 | pmc = 2494880 | doi = 10.1093/jb/mvj034 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such modifications can also determine the localization of the protein, e.g., the addition of long hydrophobic groups can cause a protein to bind to a [[phospholipid]] membrane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Blenis J, Resh MD | title = Subcellular localization specified by protein acylation and phosphorylation | journal = Current Opinion in Cell Biology | volume = 5 | issue = 6 | pages = 984–9 | date = December 1993 | pmid = 8129952 | doi = 10.1016/0955-0674(93)90081-Z }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some non-proteinogenic amino acids are not found in proteins. Examples include [[2-aminoisobutyric acid]] and the neurotransmitter [[gamma-aminobutyric acid]]. Non-proteinogenic amino acids often occur as intermediates in the [[metabolic pathway]]s for standard amino acids&amp;nbsp;– for example, [[ornithine]] and [[citrulline]] occur in the [[urea cycle]], part of amino acid [[catabolism]] (see below).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Curis E, Nicolis I, Moinard C, Osowska S, Zerrouk N, Bénazeth S, Cynober L | title = Almost all about citrulline in mammals | journal = Amino Acids | volume = 29 | issue = 3 | pages = 177–205 | date = November 2005 | pmid = 16082501 | doi = 10.1007/s00726-005-0235-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A rare exception to the dominance of α-amino acids in biology is the β-amino acid [[beta alanine]] (3-aminopropanoic acid), which is used in plants and microorganisms in the synthesis of [[pantothenic acid]] (vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;), a component of [[coenzyme A]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Coxon KM, Chakauya E, Ottenhof HH, Whitney HM, Blundell TL, Abell C, Smith AG | title = Pantothenate biosynthesis in higher plants | journal = Biochemical Society Transactions | volume = 33 | issue = Pt 4 | pages = 743–6 | date = August 2005 | pmid = 16042590 | doi = 10.1042/BST0330743 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===&lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;-amino acid natural abundance===
&lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;-isomers are uncommon in live organisms. For instance, [[gramicidin]] is a polypeptide made up from mixture of &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;- and &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-amino acids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ketchem RR, Hu W, Cross TA | title = High-resolution conformation of gramicidin A in a lipid bilayer by solid-state NMR | journal = Science | volume = 261 | issue = 5127 | pages = 1457–60 | date = September 1993 | pmid = 7690158 | doi = 10.1126/science.7690158 | bibcode = 1993Sci...261.1457K }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other compounds containing [[D-amino acids|&lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;-amino acid]] are [[tyrocidine]] and [[valinomycin]]. These compounds disrupt bacterial cell walls, particularly in [[Gram-positive]] bacteria. Only 837 &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;-amino acids were found in Swiss-Prot database (187 million amino acids analysed).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Khoury GA, Baliban RC, Floudas CA | title = Proteome-wide post-translational modification statistics: frequency analysis and curation of the swiss-prot database | journal = Scientific Reports | volume = 1 | issue = 90 | date = September 2011 | pmid = 22034591 | pmc = 3201773 | doi = 10.1038/srep00090 | bibcode = 2011NatSR...1E..90K }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-standard amino acids===
The 20 amino acids that are encoded directly by the codons of the universal [[genetic code]] are called ''standard'' or ''canonical'' amino acids. A modified form of methionine ([[N-Formylmethionine|''N''-formylmethionine]]) is often incorporated in place of methionine as the initial amino acid of proteins in bacteria, mitochondria and chloroplasts. Other amino acids are called ''non-standard'' or ''non-canonical''. Most of the non-standard amino acids are also non-proteinogenic (i.e. they cannot be incorporated into proteins during translation), but two of them are proteinogenic, as they can be incorporated translationally into proteins by exploiting information not encoded in the universal genetic code.

The two non-standard proteinogenic amino acids are [[selenocysteine]] (present in many non-eukaryotes as well as most eukaryotes, but not coded directly by DNA) and [[pyrrolysine]] (found only in some [[archaea]] and one [[bacterium]]). The incorporation of these non-standard amino acids is rare. For example, 25 human proteins include selenocysteine (Sec) in their primary structure,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kryukov GV, Castellano S, Novoselov SV, Lobanov AV, Zehtab O, Guigó R, Gladyshev VN | title = Characterization of mammalian selenoproteomes | journal = Science | volume = 300 | issue = 5624 | pages = 1439–43 | date = May 2003 | pmid = 12775843 | doi = 10.1126/science.1083516 | bibcode = 2003Sci...300.1439K }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the structurally characterized enzymes (selenoenzymes) employ Sec as the catalytic [[moiety (chemistry)|moiety]] in their active sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gromer S, Urig S, Becker K | title = The thioredoxin system—from science to clinic | journal = Medicinal Research Reviews | volume = 24 | issue = 1 | pages = 40–89 | date = January 2004 | pmid = 14595672 | doi = 10.1002/med.10051 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pyrrolysine and selenocysteine are encoded via variant codons. For example, selenocysteine is encoded by [[stop codon]] and [[SECIS element]].&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="VoJw6fIISSkC p.299"/&gt;&lt;ref name="url_The_Genetic_Codes_NCBI" /&gt;

When taken up into the human body from the diet, the 20 standard amino acids either are used to synthesize proteins and other biomolecules or are oxidized to [[urea]] and [[carbon dioxide]] as a source of energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sakami W, Harrington H | title = Amino acid metabolism | journal = Annual Review of Biochemistry | volume = 32 | issue = 1 | pages = 355–98 | year = 1963 | pmid = 14144484 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.bi.32.070163.002035 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The oxidation pathway starts with the removal of the amino group by a [[transaminase]]; the amino group is then fed into the [[urea cycle]].

{{Catecholamine and trace amine biosynthesis|align=right|caption=[[Catecholamine]]s and [[trace amine]]s are synthesized from phenylalanine and tyrosine in humans.}}
{{Further|Amino acid neurotransmitter}}

In humans, non-protein amino acids also have important roles as [[metabolic intermediate]]s, such as in the biosynthesis of the [[neurotransmitter]] [[gamma-amino-butyric acid]] (GABA). Many amino acids are used to synthesize other molecules, for example:
* [[Tryptophan]] is a precursor of the neurotransmitter [[serotonin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Savelieva KV, Zhao S, Pogorelov VM, Rajan I, Yang Q, Cullinan E, Lanthorn TH | title = Genetic disruption of both tryptophan hydroxylase genes dramatically reduces serotonin and affects behavior in models sensitive to antidepressants | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 3 | issue = 10 | pages = e3301 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18923670 | pmc = 2565062 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0003301 | editor1-last = Bartolomucci | bibcode = 2008PLoSO...3.3301S | editor1-first = Alessandro }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Tyrosine]] (and its precursor phenylalanine) are precursors of the [[catecholamine]] [[neurotransmitter]]s [[dopamine]], [[epinephrine]] and [[norepinephrine]] and various [[trace amine]]s.
* [[Phenylalanine]] is a precursor of [[phenethylamine]] and tyrosine in humans.  In plants, it is a precursor of various [[phenylpropanoid]]s, which are important in plant metabolism.
* [[Glycine]] is a precursor of [[porphyrin]]s such as [[heme]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Shemin D, Rittenberg D | title = The biological utilization of glycine for the synthesis of the protoporphyrin of hemoglobin | journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 166 | issue = 2 | pages = 621–5 | date = December 1946 | pmid = 20276176 | url = http://www.jbc.org/cgi/reprint/166/2/621 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses in industry==
Amino acids are used for a variety of applications in industry, but their main use is as additives to [[Compound feed|animal feed]]. This is necessary, since many of the bulk components of these feeds, such as [[soybean]]s, either have low levels or lack some of the [[essential amino acid]]s: lysine, methionine, threonine, and tryptophan are most important in the production of these feeds.&lt;ref name=Leuchtenberger2005&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Leuchtenberger W, Huthmacher K, Drauz K | title = Biotechnological production of amino acids and derivatives: current status and prospects | journal = Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology | volume = 69 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–8 | date = November 2005 | pmid = 16195792 | doi = 10.1007/s00253-005-0155-y }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this industry, amino acids are also used to chelate metal cations in order to improve the absorption of minerals from supplements, which may be required to improve the health or production of these animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ashmead|first=H. DeWayne | name-list-format = vanc |title=The Role of Amino Acid Chelates in Animal Nutrition|year=1993|publisher=Noyes Publications|location=Westwood}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[food industry]] is also a major consumer of amino acids, in particular, [[glutamic acid]], which is used as a [[flavor enhancer]],&lt;ref name=Garattini&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Garattini S | title = Glutamic acid, twenty years later | journal = The Journal of Nutrition | volume = 130 | issue = 4S Suppl | pages = 901S–9S | date = April 2000 | pmid = 10736350 | url = http://jn.nutrition.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=10736350 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[aspartame]] (aspartyl-phenylalanine-1-methyl ester) as a low-calorie [[artificial sweetener]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Stegink LD | title = The aspartame story: a model for the clinical testing of a food additive | journal = The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition | volume = 46 | issue = 1 Suppl | pages = 204–15 | date = July 1987 | pmid = 3300262 | url = http://www.ajcn.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=3300262 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar technology to that used for animal nutrition is employed in the human nutrition industry to alleviate symptoms of mineral deficiencies, such as anemia, by improving mineral absorption and reducing negative side effects from inorganic mineral supplementation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Albion Laboratories, Inc.|title=Albion Ferrochel Website|url=http://www.albionferrochel.com|accessdate=12 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The chelating ability of amino acids has been used in fertilizers for agriculture to facilitate the delivery of minerals to plants in order to correct mineral deficiencies, such as iron chlorosis. These fertilizers are also used to prevent deficiencies from occurring and improving the overall health of the plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ashmead|first=H. DeWayne | name-list-format = vanc |title=Foliar Feeding of Plants with Amino Acid Chelates|year=1986|publisher=Noyes Publications|location=Park Ridge}}&lt;/ref&gt; The remaining production of amino acids is used in the synthesis of [[Pharmaceutical drug|drugs]] and [[cosmetics]].&lt;ref name=Leuchtenberger2005/&gt;

Similarly, some amino acids derivatives are used in pharmaceutical industry. They include [[5-HTP]] (5-hydroxytryptophan) used for experimental treatment of depression,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Turner EH, Loftis JM, Blackwell AD | title = Serotonin a la carte: supplementation with the serotonin precursor 5-hydroxytryptophan | journal = Pharmacology &amp; Therapeutics | volume = 109 | issue = 3 | pages = 325–38 | date = March 2006 | pmid = 16023217 | doi = 10.1016/j.pharmthera.2005.06.004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[L-DOPA|&lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-DOPA]] (&lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-dihydroxyphenylalanine) for [[Parkinson's]] treatment,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kostrzewa RM, Nowak P, Kostrzewa JP, Kostrzewa RA, Brus R | title = Peculiarities of L: -DOPA treatment of Parkinson's disease | journal = Amino Acids | volume = 28 | issue = 2 | pages = 157–64 | date = March 2005 | pmid = 15750845 | doi = 10.1007/s00726-005-0162-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[eflornithine]] drug that inhibits [[ornithine decarboxylase]] and used in the treatment of [[African trypanosomiasis|sleeping sickness]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Heby O, Persson L, Rentala M | title = Targeting the polyamine biosynthetic enzymes: a promising approach to therapy of African sleeping sickness, Chagas' disease, and leishmaniasis | journal = Amino Acids | volume = 33 | issue = 2 | pages = 359–66 | date = August 2007 | pmid = 17610127 | doi = 10.1007/s00726-007-0537-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Expanded genetic code===
{{Main|Expanded genetic code}}
Since 2001, 40 non-natural amino acids have been added into protein by creating a unique codon (recoding) and a corresponding transfer-RNA:aminoacyl&amp;nbsp;– tRNA-synthetase pair to encode it with diverse physicochemical and biological properties in order to be used as a tool to exploring [[protein structure]] and function or to create novel or enhanced proteins.&lt;ref name="pmid16260173"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid19318213"/&gt;

===Nullomers===
{{Main|Nullomers}}
Nullomers are codons that in theory code for an amino acid, however in nature there is a selective bias against using this codon in favor of another, for example bacteria prefer to use CGA instead of AGA to code for arginine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cruz-Vera LR, Magos-Castro MA, Zamora-Romo E, Guarneros G | title = Ribosome stalling and peptidyl-tRNA drop-off during translational delay at AGA codons | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 32 | issue = 15 | pages = 4462–8 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15317870 | pmc = 516057 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gkh784 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This creates some sequences that do not appear in the genome.

===Chemical building blocks===
{{further|Asymmetric synthesis}}
Amino acids are important as low-cost [[feedstock]]s.

Amino acids have been investigated as precursors [[chiral catalyst]]s, e.g., for asymmetric [[hydrogenation]] reactions, although no commercial applications exist.&lt;ref name=Blaser1992&gt;{{cite journal | last = Blaser | first = Hans Ulrich | name-list-format = vanc | year = 1992 | title = The chiral pool as a source of enantioselective catalysts and auxiliaries |journal=Chemical Reviews |volume=92 |issue=5 |pages=935–52 |doi=10.1021/cr00013a009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biodegradable plastics===
{{further|Biodegradable plastic|Biopolymer}}

Amino acids are under development as components of a range of biodegradable polymers. These materials have applications as [[environmentally friendly]] packaging and in medicine in [[drug delivery]] and the construction of [[prosthesis|prosthetic implants]]. These polymers include polypeptides, [[polyamide]]s, polyesters, polysulfides, and polyurethanes with amino acids either forming part of their main chains or bonded as side chains.

==Reactions==
As amino acids have both a primary [[amine]] group and a primary [[carboxyl]] group, these chemicals can undergo most of the reactions associated with these functional groups. These include [[nucleophilic addition]], [[amide|amide bond]] formation, and [[Alkylimino-de-oxo-bisubstitution|imine formation]] for the amine group, and [[esterification]], [[amide|amide bond]] formation, and [[decarboxylation]] for the carboxylic acid group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Elmore | first1 = Donald Trevor | last2 = Barrett | first2 = GC | name-list-format = vanc | title = Amino acids and peptides |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, UK |year=1998 |pages=48–60 |isbn=0-521-46827-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The combination of these functional groups allow amino acids to be effective polydentate ligands for metal-amino acid chelates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Konara S, Gagnona K, Clearfield A, Thompson C, Hartle J, Ericson C, Nelson C | title = Structural determination and characterization of copper and zinc bis-glycinates with X-ray crystallography and mass spectrometry | journal = Journal of Coordination Chemistry | year = 2010 | volume = 63 | issue = 19 | doi = 10.1080/00958972.2010.514336 | pages = 3335–47 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The multiple side chains of amino acids can also undergo chemical reactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gutteridge A, Thornton JM | title = Understanding nature's catalytic toolkit | journal = Trends in Biochemical Sciences | volume = 30 | issue = 11 | pages = 622–9 | date = November 2005 | pmid = 16214343 | doi = 10.1016/j.tibs.2005.09.006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The types of these reactions are determined by the groups on these side chains and are, therefore, different between the various types of amino acid.

===Chemical synthesis===

{{see also|Category:Chemical synthesis of amino acids}}
Several methods exist to synthesize amino acids. One of the oldest methods begins with the [[Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky halogenation|bromination]] at the α-carbon of a carboxylic acid.

At the current time, the most-adopted method is an [[automated]] synthesis on a solid support (e.g., [[polystyrene]] beads), using [[protecting group]]s (e.g., [[Fmoc chloride|Fmoc]] and [[Tert-butyloxycarbonyl protecting group|t-Boc]]) and activating groups (e.g., [[dicyclohexylcarbodiimide|DCC]] and [[diisopropylcarbodiimide|DIC]]).

===Peptide bond formation===
{{see also|Peptide synthesis|Peptide bond}}
[[File:Peptidformationball.svg|thumbnail|right|400px|The condensation of two amino acids to form a ''[[dipeptide]]'' through a ''[[peptide bond]]''|alt=Two amino acids are shown next to each other. One loses a hydrogen and oxygen from its carboxyl group (COOH) and the other loses a hydrogen from its amino group (NH2). This reaction produces a molecule of water (H2O) and two amino acids joined by a peptide bond (-CO-NH-). The two joined amino acids are called a dipeptide.]]

As both the amine and carboxylic acid groups of amino acids can react to form amide bonds, one amino acid molecule can react with another and become joined through an amide linkage. This [[polymerization]] of amino acids is what creates proteins. This [[condensation reaction]] yields the newly formed [[peptide bond]] and a molecule of water. In cells, this reaction does not occur directly; instead, the amino acid is first activated by attachment to a [[transfer RNA]] molecule through an [[ester]] bond. This aminoacyl-tRNA is produced in an [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]]-dependent reaction carried out by an [[aminoacyl tRNA synthetase]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ibba M, Söll D | title = The renaissance of aminoacyl-tRNA synthesis | journal = EMBO Reports | volume = 2 | issue = 5 | pages = 382–7 | date = May 2001 | pmid = 11375928 | pmc = 1083889 | doi = 10.1093/embo-reports/kve095 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This aminoacyl-tRNA is then a substrate for the [[ribosome]], which catalyzes the attack of the amino group of the elongating protein chain on the ester bond.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lengyel P, Söll D | title = Mechanism of protein biosynthesis | journal = Bacteriological Reviews | volume = 33 | issue = 2 | pages = 264–301 | date = June 1969 | pmid = 4896351 | pmc = 378322 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of this mechanism, all proteins made by ribosomes are synthesized starting at their N-terminus and moving toward their C-terminus.

However, not all peptide bonds are formed in this way. In a few cases, peptides are synthesized by specific enzymes. For example, the tripeptide [[glutathione]] is an essential part of the defenses of cells against oxidative stress. This peptide is synthesized in two steps from free amino acids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wu G, Fang YZ, Yang S, Lupton JR, Turner ND | title = Glutathione metabolism and its implications for health | journal = The Journal of Nutrition | volume = 134 | issue = 3 | pages = 489–92 | date = March 2004 | pmid = 14988435 | url = http://jn.nutrition.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=14988435 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the first step, [[gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase]] condenses [[cysteine]] and [[glutamic acid]] through a peptide bond formed between the side chain carboxyl of the glutamate (the gamma carbon of this side chain) and the amino group of the cysteine. This dipeptide is then condensed with [[glycine]] by [[glutathione synthetase]] to form glutathione.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Meister A | title = Glutathione metabolism and its selective modification | journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 263 | issue = 33 | pages = 17205–8 | date = November 1988 | pmid = 3053703 | url = http://www.jbc.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=3053703 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In chemistry, peptides are synthesized by a variety of reactions. One of the most-used in [[peptide synthesis|solid-phase peptide synthesis]] uses the aromatic oxime derivatives of amino acids as activated units. These are added in sequence onto the growing peptide chain, which is attached to a solid resin support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first1 = Louis A. | last1 = Carpino | name-list-format = vanc | year = 1992 | title = 1-Hydroxy-7-azabenzotriazole. An efficient peptide coupling additive |journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society |volume=115 |pages=4397–8 |doi=10.1021/ja00063a082 |issue=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ability to easily synthesize vast numbers of different peptides by varying the types and order of amino acids (using [[combinatorial chemistry]]) has made peptide synthesis particularly important in creating libraries of peptides for use in drug discovery through [[high-throughput screening]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Marasco D, Perretta G, Sabatella M, Ruvo M | title = Past and future perspectives of synthetic peptide libraries | journal = Current Protein &amp; Peptide Science | volume = 9 | issue = 5 | pages = 447–67 | date = October 2008 | pmid = 18855697 | doi = 10.2174/138920308785915209 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biosynthesis===
{{Main|Amino acid synthesis}}
In plants, nitrogen is first assimilated into organic compounds in the form of [[glutamate]], formed from alpha-ketoglutarate and ammonia in the mitochondrion. In order to form other amino acids, the plant uses [[transaminase]]s to move the amino group to another alpha-keto carboxylic acid. For example, aspartate aminotransferase converts glutamate and oxaloacetate to alpha-ketoglutarate and aspartate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Jones | first1 = Russell Celyn | last2 = Buchanan | first2 = Bob B. | last3 = Gruissem | first3 = Wilhelm | name-list-format = vanc |title=Biochemistry &amp; molecular biology of plants |publisher=American Society of Plant Physiologists |location=Rockville, Md |year=2000 |pages=371–2 |isbn=0-943088-39-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other organisms use transaminases for amino acid synthesis, too.

Nonstandard amino acids are usually formed through modifications to standard amino acids. For example, [[homocysteine]] is formed through the [[transsulfuration pathway]] or by the demethylation of methionine via the intermediate metabolite [[S-adenosyl methionine]],&lt;ref name="Brosnan"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brosnan JT, Brosnan ME | title = The sulfur-containing amino acids: an overview | journal = The Journal of Nutrition | volume = 136 | issue = 6 Suppl | pages = 1636S–1640S | date = June 2006 | pmid = 16702333 | url = http://jn.nutrition.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=16702333 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[hydroxyproline]] is made by a [[posttranslational modification]] of [[proline]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kivirikko KI, Pihlajaniemi T | title = Collagen hydroxylases and the protein disulfide isomerase subunit of prolyl 4-hydroxylases | journal = Advances in Enzymology and Related Areas of Molecular Biology | volume = 72 | issue =  | pages = 325–98 | year = 1998 | pmid = 9559057 | doi = 10.1002/9780470123188.ch9 | isbn = 9780470123188 | series = Advances in Enzymology – and Related Areas of Molecular Biology }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Microorganism]]s and plants can synthesize many uncommon amino acids. For example, some microbes make [[2-aminoisobutyric acid]] and [[lanthionine]], which is a sulfide-bridged derivative of alanine. Both of these amino acids are found in peptidic [[lantibiotics]] such as [[alamethicin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Whitmore L, Wallace BA | title = Analysis of peptaibol sequence composition: implications for in vivo synthesis and channel formation | journal = European Biophysics Journal | volume = 33 | issue = 3 | pages = 233–7 | date = May 2004 | pmid = 14534753 | doi = 10.1007/s00249-003-0348-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in plants, [[1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid]] is a small disubstituted cyclic amino acid that is a key intermediate in the production of the plant hormone [[ethylene#Ethylene as a plant hormone|ethylene]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Alexander L, Grierson D | title = Ethylene biosynthesis and action in tomato: a model for climacteric fruit ripening | journal = Journal of Experimental Botany | volume = 53 | issue = 377 | pages = 2039–55 | date = October 2002 | pmid = 12324528 | doi = 10.1093/jxb/erf072 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Catabolism===
[[File:Amino acid catabolism revised.png|thumb|300px|Catabolism of proteinogenic amino acids. Amino acids can be classified according to the properties of their main products as either of the following:&lt;ref&gt;Stipanuk, M. H. (2006). Biochemical, physiological, &amp; molecular aspects of human nutrition (2 ed.): Saunders Elsevier.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;br&gt;* ''Glucogenic'', with the products having the ability to form [[glucose]] by [[gluconeogenesis]]
&lt;br&gt;* ''Ketogenic'', with the products not having the ability to form glucose. These products may still be used for [[ketogenesis]] or [[lipid synthesis]].
&lt;br&gt;* Amino acids catabolized into both glucogenic and ketogenic products.]]
Amino acids must first pass out of organelles and cells into blood circulation via [[amino acid transporter]]s, since the amine and carboxylic acid groups are typically ionized. Degradation of an amino acid, occurring in the liver and kidneys, often involves [[deamination]] by moving its amino group to alpha-ketoglutarate, forming [[glutamate]]. This process involves transaminases, often the same as those used in amination during synthesis. In many vertebrates, the amino group is then removed through the [[urea cycle]] and is excreted in the form of [[urea]]. However, amino acid degradation can produce [[uric acid]] or ammonia instead. For example, [[serine dehydratase]] converts serine to pyruvate and ammonia.&lt;ref name = "Stryer_2002" /&gt; After removal of one or more amino groups, the remainder of the molecule can sometimes be used to synthesize new amino acids, or it can be used for energy by entering [[glycolysis]] or the [[citric acid cycle]], as detailed in image at right.

==Physicochemical properties of amino acids==
The 20 amino acids encoded directly by the genetic code can be divided into several groups based on their properties. Important factors are charge, [[hydrophile|hydrophilicity]] or [[hydrophobe|hydrophobicity]], size, and functional groups.&lt;ref name="Creighton" /&gt; These properties are important for [[protein structure]] and [[protein–protein interaction]]s. The water-soluble proteins tend to have their hydrophobic residues (Leu, Ile, Val, Phe, and Trp) buried in the middle of the protein, whereas hydrophilic side chains are exposed to the aqueous solvent. (Note that in [[biochemistry]], a residue refers to a specific [[monomer]] within the [[polymer|polymeric chain]] of a [[polysaccharide]], [[protein]] or [[nucleic acid]].) The [[integral membrane protein]]s tend to have outer rings of exposed [[hydrophobic]] amino acids that anchor them into the [[lipid bilayer]]. In the case part-way between these two extremes, some [[peripheral membrane protein]]s have a patch of hydrophobic amino acids on their surface that locks onto the membrane. In similar fashion, proteins that have to bind to positively charged molecules have surfaces rich with negatively charged amino acids like [[glutamate]] and [[aspartate]], while proteins binding to negatively charged molecules have surfaces rich with positively charged chains like [[lysine]] and [[arginine]]. There are different [[hydrophobicity scale]]s of amino acid residues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| vauthors = Urry DW | title = The change in Gibbs free energy for hydrophobic association: Derivation and evaluation by means of inverse temperature transitions | journal = Chemical Physics Letters | volume = 399 | issue = 1–3 | pages = 177–83 | year = 2004 | doi = 10.1016/S0009-2614(04)01565-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some amino acids have special properties such as [[cysteine]], that can form covalent [[disulfide bond]]s to other cysteine residues, [[proline]] that forms [[cyclic compound|a cycle]] to the polypeptide backbone, and [[glycine]] that is more flexible than other amino acids.

Many proteins undergo a range of [[posttranslational modification]]s, when additional chemical groups are attached to the amino acids in proteins. Some modifications can produce hydrophobic [[lipoprotein]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Magee T, Seabra MC | title = Fatty acylation and prenylation of proteins: what's hot in fat | journal = Current Opinion in Cell Biology | volume = 17 | issue = 2 | pages = 190–6 | date = April 2005 | pmid = 15780596 | doi = 10.1016/j.ceb.2005.02.003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or hydrophilic [[glycoprotein]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pilobello KT, Mahal LK | title = Deciphering the glycocode: the complexity and analytical challenge of glycomics | journal = Current Opinion in Chemical Biology | volume = 11 | issue = 3 | pages = 300–5 | date = June 2007 | pmid = 17500024 | doi = 10.1016/j.cbpa.2007.05.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These type of modification allow the reversible targeting of a protein to a membrane. For example, the addition and removal of the fatty acid [[palmitic acid]] to cysteine residues in some signaling proteins causes the proteins to attach and then detach from cell membranes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Smotrys JE, Linder ME | title = Palmitoylation of intracellular signaling proteins: regulation and function | journal = Annual Review of Biochemistry | volume = 73 | issue = 1 | pages = 559–87 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15189153 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.biochem.73.011303.073954 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Unk''' is sometimes used instead of '''Xaa''', but is less standard.

In addition, many [[Non-proteinogenic amino acids|non-standard amino acids]] have a specific code. For example, several peptide drugs, such as [[Bortezomib]] and [[MG132]], are [[peptide synthesis|artificially synthesized]] and retain their [[protecting group]]s, which have specific codes. Bortezomib is [[pyrazinoic acid|Pyz]]-Phe-boroLeu, and MG132 is [[Carboxybenzyl|Z]]-Leu-Leu-Leu-al. To aid in the analysis of protein structure, [[photo-reactive amino acid analog]]s are available. These include [[photoleucine]] ('''pLeu''') and [[photomethionine]] ('''pMet''').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Suchanek M, Radzikowska A, Thiele C | title = Photo-leucine and photo-methionine allow identification of protein-protein interactions in living cells | journal = Nature Methods | volume = 2 | issue = 4 | pages = 261–7 | date = April 2005 | pmid = 15782218 | doi = 10.1038/nmeth752 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2073">'''Hydrogen corrosion''' is a form of metal [[corrosion]] occurring in the presence of anoxic water. Hydrogen corrosion involves a [[redox]] reaction that reduces hydrogen ions, forming molecular hydrogen. 

Metals enter aqueous solution and are oxidized.

''Oxidation reaction (pH independent):''
:&lt;math&gt;Fe\;\rightarrow\;Fe^{2+}\;+\;2\,e^-&lt;/math&gt;

''Reduction reaction in acid solution:''
:&lt;math&gt;2\,H^+\;+\;2\,e^-\rightarrow\;H_2\;&lt;/math&gt;

In an acidic solution, the water molecules are [[protonated]] and the [[hydronium]] ions (H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) are directly reduced into H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

''Reduction reaction in neutral or slightly alkaline solution:''
:&lt;math&gt;2\,H_2O\;+\;2\,e^-\;\rightarrow\;H_2\;+\;2\,OH^-&lt;/math&gt;

In a neutral or slightly alkaline solution, the protons of water are reduced into molecular hydrogen giving rise to the production of hydroxide ions responsible of the precipitation of the slightly soluble ferrous hydroxide (Fe(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).

This finally leads to the global reaction of the anaerobic corrosion of iron in water:

:&lt;math&gt;Fe\;+\;2\,H_{2}O\;\rightarrow\;Fe(OH)_2\;+\;H_2\;&lt;/math&gt;

==Transformation of ferrous hydroxide into magnetite==
Under anaerobic conditions, the [[ferrous hydroxide]] (Fe(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ) can be oxidized by the [[proton]]s of water to form [[magnetite]] and molecular [[hydrogen]].
This process is described by the [[Schikorr reaction]]:

:''3 Fe(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O''
:''ferrous hydroxide → magnetite + hydrogen + water''

The well crystallized magnetite (Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) is thermodynamically more stable than the ferrous hydroxide (Fe(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ).

This process also occurs during the [[wikt:anaerobic|anaerobic]] corrosion of [[iron]] and [[steel]] in [[Anoxic waters|oxygen-free]] [[groundwater]] and in reducing [[soil]]s below the [[water table]].

[[File:Photo Electric Cell Evolving Hydrogen and Oxygen.jpg|thumb|A sample of a photoelectric cell in a lab environment. Catalysts are added to the cell, which is submerged in water and illuminated by simulated sunlight. The bubbles seen are oxygen (forming on the front of the cell) and hydrogen (forming on the back of the cell).]]

'''Artificial photosynthesis''' is a [[chemical process]] that replicates the natural process of [[photosynthesis]], a process that converts [[sunlight]], [[water]], and [[carbon dioxide]] into [[carbohydrates]] and [[oxygen]]; as an imitation of a natural process it is [[biomimetics|biomimetic]]. The term, artificial photosynthesis, is commonly used to refer to any scheme for capturing and storing the energy from sunlight in the chemical bonds of a fuel (a [[solar fuel]]). [[Photocatalytic water splitting]] converts water into [[hydrogen]] and oxygen, and is a major research topic of artificial photosynthesis. [[Photochemical carbon dioxide reduction|Light-driven carbon dioxide reduction]] is another process studied, that replicates natural [[carbon fixation]].

Research of this topic includes the design and assembly of devices for the direct production of solar fuels, [[photoelectrochemistry]] and its application in fuel cells, and the engineering of [[enzyme]]s and [[photoautotrophic]] [[microorganism]]s for microbial [[biofuel]] and [[biohydrogen]] production from sunlight.

== Overview ==
The photosynthetic reaction can be divided into two [[half-reaction]]s of [[redox|oxidation and reduction]], both of which are essential to producing [[fuel]]. In plant photosynthesis, water molecules are photo-oxidized to release oxygen and protons. The second phase of plant photosynthesis (also known as the [[Calvin-Benson cycle]]) is a [[light-independent reaction]] that converts carbon dioxide into [[glucose]] (fuel). Researchers of artificial photosynthesis are developing [[photocatalyst]]s that are able to perform both of these reactions. Furthermore, the protons resulting from water splitting can be used for hydrogen production. These [[catalyst]]s must be able to react quickly and absorb a large percentage of the incident solar [[photons]].&lt;ref name=Yarris&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; One way of using natural photosynthesis is for the production of a [[biofuel]], which is an indirect process that suffers from low energy conversion efficiency (due to photosynthesis' own low efficiency in converting sunlight to biomass), the cost of harvesting and transporting the fuel, and conflicts due to the increasing need of land mass for food production.&lt;ref name=Listorti&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of artificial photosynthesis is to produce a fuel from sunlight that can be stored conveniently and used when sunlight is not available, by using direct processes, that is, to produce a [[solar fuel]]. With the development of catalysts able to reproduce the major parts of photosynthesis, water and sunlight would ultimately be the only needed sources for clean energy production. The only by-product would be oxygen, and production of a solar fuel has the potential to be cheaper than gasoline.&lt;ref name=Gathman&gt;{{cite web

*A homogeneous system is one such that catalysts are not [[Compartmentalization (engineering)|compartmentalized]], that is, components are present in the same compartment. This means that hydrogen and oxygen are produced in the same location. This can be a drawback, since they compose an explosive mixture, demanding gas product separation. Also, all components must be active in approximately the same conditions (e.g., [[pH]]).
*A heterogeneous system has two separate [[electrodes]], an anode and a cathode, making possible the separation of oxygen and hydrogen production. Furthermore, different components do not necessarily need to work in the same conditions. However, the increased complexity of these systems makes them harder to develop and more expensive.

Another area of research within artificial photosynthesis is the selection and manipulation of photosynthetic microorganisms, namely green [[microalgae]] and [[cyanobacteria]], for the production of solar fuels. Many [[Strain (biology)|strains]] are able to produce hydrogen naturally, and scientists are working to improve them.&lt;ref name=Magnuson&gt;{{cite journal

== History ==
Artificial photosynthesis was first anticipated by the Italian chemist [[Giacomo Ciamician]] during 1912.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Armaroli | first1 = Nicola | authorlink = Nicola Armaroli | authorlink2 = Vincenzo Balzani | last2 = Balzani | first2 = Vincenzo | year = 2007 | title = The Future of Energy Supply: Challenges and Opportunities | url = | journal = [[Angewandte Chemie]] | volume = 46 | issue = 1–2| pages = 52–66 | doi = 10.1002/anie.200602373 | pmid = 17103469 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a lecture that was it later published in [[Science (journal)|Science]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Giacomo Ciamician]], ''The Photochemistry of the Future''. In: ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' 36, No. 926, (1912), 385-394, {{DOI|10.1126/science.36.926.385}}.&lt;/ref&gt; he proposed a switch from the use of [[fossil fuel]]s to radiant energy provided by the sun and captured by technical photochemistry devices. In this switch he saw a possibility to lessen the difference between the rich north of Europe and poor south and ventured a guess that this switch from [[coal]] to [[solar energy]] would "not be harmful to the progress and to human happiness."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Balzani | first1 = Vincenzo | display-authors = etal   | year = 2008 | title = Photochemical Conversion of Solar Energy | url = | journal = [[ChemSusChem]] | volume = 1 | issue = 1–2| pages = 26–58 | doi = 10.1002/cssc.200700087 | pmid = 18605661 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the late 1960s, [[Akira Fujishima]] discovered the photocatalytic properties of [[titanium dioxide]], the so-called Honda-Fujishima effect, which could be used for [[hydrolysis]].&lt;ref name=Fujishima&gt;{{cite journal

The Swedish Consortium for Artificial Photosynthesis, the first of its kind, was established during 1994 as a collaboration between groups of three different universities, [[Lund University|Lund]], [[Uppsala University|Uppsala]] and [[Stockholm University|Stockholm]], being presently active around [[Lund]] and the Ångström Laboratories in Uppsala.&lt;ref name=CAP&gt;{{cite web

Visible light water splitting with a one piece multijunction cell was first demonstrated and patented by William Ayers at Energy Conversion Devices during 1983.&lt;ref&gt;William Ayers, US Patent 4,466,869 Photolytic Production of Hydrogen&lt;/ref&gt; This group demonstrated water photolysis into hydrogen and oxygen, now referred to as an "artificial leaf" or "wireless solar water splitting" with a low cost, thin film amorphous silicon multijunction cell immersed directly in water. Hydrogen evolved on the front amorphous silicon surface decorated with various catalysts while oxygen evolved from the back metal substrate which also eliminated the hazard of mixed hydrogen/oxygen gas evolution. A Nafion membrane above the immersed cell provided a path for proton transport. The higher photovoltage available from the multijuction thin film cell with visible light was a major advance over previous photolysis attempts with UV sensitive single junction cells.  The group's patent also lists several other semiconductor multijunction compositions in addition to amorphous silicon.

Artificial photosynthesis remained an academic field for many years.

== Current research ==
In energy terms, natural photosynthesis can be divided in three steps:&lt;ref name=Andreiadis/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hammarstrom/&gt;
* [[Light-harvesting complex]]es in bacteria and plants capture photons and transduce them into electrons, injecting them into the photosynthetic chain.
* [[Proton-coupled electron transfer]] along several cofactors of the photosynthetic chain, causing local, spatial [[photoinduced charge separation|charge separation]].
* Redox catalysis, which uses the aforementioned transferred electrons to oxidize water to dioxygen and protons; these protons can in some species be utilized for [[biohydrogen|dihydrogen production]].

[[File:Triad general scheme.svg|thumb|400px|A triad assembly, with a photosensitizer (P) linked in tandem to a water oxidation catalyst (D) and a hydrogen evolving catalyst (A). Electrons flow from D to A when catalysis occurs.]]

Using [[biomimetic]] approaches, artificial photosynthesis tries to construct systems doing the same type of processes. Ideally, a [[Catalytic triad|triad]] assembly could oxidize water with one catalyst, reduce protons with another and have a [[photosensitizer]] molecule to power the whole system. One of the simplest designs is where the photosensitizer is linked in tandem between a water oxidation catalyst and a hydrogen evolving catalyst:
* The photosensitizer transfers electrons to the hydrogen catalyst when hit by light, becoming oxidized in the process.
* This drives the water splitting catalyst to donate electrons to the photosensitizer. In a triad assembly, such a catalyst is often referred to as a donor. The oxidized donor is able to perform water oxidation.
The state of the triad with one catalyst oxidized on one end and the second one reduced on the other end of the triad is referred to as a charge separation, and is a driving force for further electron transfer, and consequently catalysis, to occur. The different components may be assembled in diverse ways, such as [[supramolecular]] complexes, compartmentalized cells, or linearly, [[covalent]]ly linked molecules.&lt;ref name=Andreiadis/&gt;

Research into finding catalysts that can convert water, carbon dioxide, and sunlight to carbohydrates or hydrogen is a current, active field. By studying the natural [[oxygen-evolving complex]] (OEC), researchers have developed catalysts such as the "blue dimer" to mimic its function or inorganic-based materials such as Birnessite with the similar building block as the OEC.&lt;ref name=mendozacortes&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these catalysts are still very inefficient.&lt;ref name=Gathman/&gt;

=== Hydrogen catalysts ===
Hydrogen is the simplest solar fuel to synthesize, since it involves only the transference of two electrons to two protons. It must, however, be done stepwise, with formation of an intermediate [[hydride]] anion:
:2 e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; + 2 H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; {{eqm}}  H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + H&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; {{eqm}} H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
The proton-to-hydrogen converting catalysts present in nature are [[hydrogenase]]s. These are [[enzyme]]s that can either reduce protons to molecular hydrogen or oxidize hydrogen to protons and electrons. [[Spectroscopy|Spectroscopic]] and [[Protein crystallography|crystallographic]] studies spanning several decades have resulted in a good understanding of both the structure and mechanism of hydrogenase catalysis.&lt;ref name=Lubitz&gt;{{cite journal

=== Water-oxidizing catalysts ===
Water oxidation is a more complex chemical reaction than proton reduction. In nature, the [[oxygen-evolving complex]] performs this reaction by accumulating reducing equivalents (electrons) in a manganese-calcium cluster within [[photosystem II]] (PS II), then delivering them to water molecules, with the resulting production of molecular oxygen and protons:
:2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 4 H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + 4e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;

Without a catalyst (natural or artificial), [[Heterogeneous water oxidation|this reaction]] is very endothermic, requiring high temperatures (at least 2500 K).&lt;ref name=Bockris/&gt;

The exact structure of the oxygen-evolving complex has been hard to determine experimentally.&lt;ref name=Yano&gt;{{cite journal

Some [[ruthenium]] complexes, such as the dinuclear µ-oxo-bridged "blue dimer" (the first of its kind to be synthesized), are capable of light-driven water oxidation, thanks to being able to form high [[valence (chemistry)|valence]] states.&lt;ref name=Andreiadis/&gt; In this case, the ruthenium complex acts as both photosensitizer and catalyst.

Many metal oxides have been found to have water oxidation catalytic activity, including [[ruthenium(IV) oxide]] (RuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), iridium(IV) oxide (IrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), cobalt oxides (including [[nickel]]-[[doping (semiconductor)|doped]] [[Cobalt(II,III) oxide|Co&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]]), [[manganese oxide]] (including layered MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (birnessite),&lt;ref name=mendozacortes/&gt; Mn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), and a mix of Mn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; with CaMn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;.

=== Photosensitizers ===
[[File:Delta-ruthenium-tris(bipyridine)-cation-3D-balls.png|thumb|200px|Structure of [[tris(bipyridine)ruthenium(II) chloride|[Ru(bipy)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;]], a broadly used photosensitizer.]]
Nature uses [[biological pigment|pigments]], mainly [[chlorophyll]]s, to absorb a broad part of the visible spectrum. Artificial systems can use either one type of pigment with a broad absorption range or combine several pigments for the same purpose.

Ruthenium [[polypyridine complex]]es, in particular [[tris(bipyridine)ruthenium(II) chloride|tris(bipyridine)ruthenium(II)]] and its derivatives, have been extensively used in hydrogen photoproduction due to their efficient visible light absorption and long-lived consequent [[MLCT|metal-to-ligand charge transfer]] [[excited state]], which makes the complexes strong reducing agents.&lt;ref name=Andreiadis/&gt; Other noble metal-containing complexes used include ones with [[platinum]], [[rhodium]] and [[iridium]].&lt;ref name=Andreiadis/&gt;

Metal-free organic complexes have also been successfully employed as photosensitizers. Examples include [[eosin Y]] and [[rose bengal]].&lt;ref name=Andreiadis/&gt; Pyrrole rings such as porphyrins have also been used in coating [[nanomaterial]]s or [[semiconductors]] for both homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis.&lt;ref name=Carraro/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kalyanasundaram/&gt;

As part of current research efforts artificial photonic antenna systems are being studied to determine efficient and sustainable ways to collect light for artificial photosynthesis. Gion Calzaferri (2009) describes one such antenna that uses zeolite L as a host for organic dyes, to mimic plant's light collecting systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Calzaferri|first1=Gion|title=Artificial Photosynthesis| journal = Topics in Catalysis |year=2010|volume = 53| issue = 3|pages = 130–140 |doi=10.1007/s11244-009-9424-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The antenna is fabricated by inserting dye molecules into the channels of zeolite L.

=== Carbon dioxide reduction catalysts ===
In nature, [[carbon fixation]] is done by [[plant|green plants]] using the enzyme [[RuBisCO]] as a part of the [[Calvin cycle]]. RuBisCO is a rather slow catalyst compared to the vast majority of other enzymes, incorporating only a few molecules of carbon dioxide into [[ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate]] per minute, but does so at atmospheric pressure and in mild, biological conditions.&lt;ref name= Ellis&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting product is further [[redox|reduced]] and eventually used in the synthesis of [[glucose]], which in turn is a precursor to more complex [[carbohydrates]], such as [[cellulose]] and [[starch]]. The process consumes energy in the form of [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] and [[NADPH]].

Artificial CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction for fuel production aims mostly at producing reduced carbon compounds from atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Some [[transition metal]] [[phosphine|polyphosphine]] complexes have been developed for this end; however, they usually require previous concentration of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; before use, and carriers (molecules that would fixate CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) that are both stable in aerobic conditions and able to concentrate CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; at atmospheric concentrations haven't been yet developed.&lt;ref name=Dubois&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The simplest product from CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction is [[carbon monoxide]] (CO), but for fuel development, further reduction is needed, and a key step also needing further development is the transfer of hydride anions to CO.&lt;ref name=Dubois/&gt;

=== Other materials and components ===
Charge separation is a major property of dyad and triad assemblies. Some nanomaterials employed are [[fullerene]]s (such as [[carbon nanotube]]s), a strategy that explores the [[pi-bonding]] properties of these materials.&lt;ref name=Carraro/&gt; Diverse modifications ([[covalent]] and non-covalent) of carbon nanotubes have been attempted to increase the efficiency of charge separation, including the addition of [[ferrocene]] and pyrrole-like molecules such as [[porphyrin]]s and [[phthalocyanine]]s.&lt;ref name=Carraro/&gt;

Since photodamage is usually a consequence in many of the tested systems after a period of exposure to light, bio-inspired photoprotectants have been tested, such as [[carotenoids]] (which are used in photosynthesis as natural protectants).&lt;ref name=McConnell&gt;{{cite journal

=== Photoelectrochemical cells ===
{{Main|Photoelectrochemical cell}}
Photoelectrochemical cells are a heterogeneous system that use light to produce either electricity or hydrogen. The vast majority of photoelectrochemical cells use semiconductors as catalysts.&lt;ref name=Kalyanasundaram/&gt; There have been attempts to use synthetic manganese complex-impregnated [[Nafion]] as a working electrode, but it has been since shown that the catalytically active species is actually the broken-down complex.&lt;ref name=Hocking&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A promising, emerging type of solar cell is the [[dye-sensitized solar cell]]. This type of cell still depends on a semiconductor (such as TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) for current conduction on one electrode, but with a coating of an organic or inorganic dye that acts as a photosensitizer; the counter electrode is a platinum catalyst for H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production.&lt;ref name=Kalyanasundaram/&gt; These cells have a self-repair mechanism and solar-to-electricity conversion efficiencies rivaling those of [[solid state (electronics)|solid-state]] semiconductor ones.&lt;ref name=Kalyanasundaram/&gt;

=== Photocatalytic water splitting in homogeneous systems ===

Bio-inspired manganese clusters have been shown to possess water oxidation activity when [[adsorption|adsorbed]] on [[clay]]s together with ruthenium photosensitizers, although with low turnover numbers.&lt;ref name=Andreiadis/&gt;

As mentioned above, some ruthenium complexes are able to oxidize water under solar light irradiation.&lt;ref name=Andreiadis/&gt; Although their photostability is still an issue, many can be reactivated by a simple adjustment of the conditions in which they work.&lt;ref name=Andreiadis/&gt; Improvement of catalyst stability has been tried resorting to [[polyoxometalate]]s, in particular ruthenium-based ones.&lt;ref name=Carraro/&gt;&lt;ref name=Andreiadis/&gt;

Whereas a fully functional artificial system is usually intended when constructing a water splitting device, some mixed methods have been tried. One of these involve the use of a [[working electrode|gold electrode]] to which photosystem II is linked; an electric current is detected upon illumination.&lt;ref name=Badura&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this [[wikt:dyad|dyad]] assembly, a so-called sacrificial donor for the photosensitizer is needed, that is, one that is externally supplied and replenished; the photosensitizer donates the necessary reducing equivalents to the hydrogen-evolving catalyst, which uses protons from a solution where it is immersed or dissolved in. Cobalt compounds such as [[cobaloximes]] are some of the best hydrogen catalysts, having been coupled to both metal-containing and metal-free photosensitizers.&lt;ref name=Andreiadis/&gt;&lt;ref name=Dempsey&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first H-cluster models linked to photosensitizers (mostly ruthenium photosensitizers, but also porphyrin-derived ones) were prepared during the early 2000s.&lt;ref name=Andreiadis/&gt; Both types of assembly are under development to improve their stability and increase their [[turnover number]]s, both necessary for constructing a sturdy, long-lived solar fuel cell.

As with water oxidation catalysis, not only fully artificial systems have been idealized: hydrogenase enzymes themselves have been engineered for photoproduction of hydrogen, by coupling the enzyme to an artificial photosensitizer, such as [Ru(bipy)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; or even [[photosystem I]].&lt;ref name=Andreiadis/&gt;&lt;ref name=Krassen/&gt;

=== NADP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/NADPH coenzyme-inspired catalyst ===
In natural photosynthesis, the [[NADPH|NADP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]] [[coenzyme]] is reducible to NADPH through binding of a [[proton]] and two [[electrons]]. This reduced form can then deliver the proton and electrons, potentially as a [[hydride]], to reactions that culminate in the production of [[carbohydrates]] (the [[Calvin cycle]]). The [[coenzyme]] is recyclable in a natural photosynthetic cycle, but this process is yet to be artificially replicated.

A current goal is to obtain an NADPH-inspired catalyst capable of recreating the natural cyclic process. Utilizing light, [[hydride]] donors would be regenerated and produced where the molecules are continuously used in a closed cycle. Brookhaven chemists are now using a [[ruthenium]]-based complex to serve as the acting model. The complex is proven to perform correspondingly with NADP+/NADPH, behaving as the foundation for the proton and two electrons needed to convert [[acetone]] to [[isopropanol]].

Currently, Brookhaven researchers are aiming to find ways for light to generate the hydride donors. The general idea is to use this process to produce fuels from [[carbon dioxide]].&lt;ref&gt;Karen Walsh 27 March 2007 [http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2007-03/dnl-ndi032707.php Building a Bio-inspired Catalytic Cycle for Fuel Production]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Photobiological production of fuels ===
Some [[photoautotrophic]] microorganisms can, under certain conditions, produce hydrogen. [[nitrogen fixation|Nitrogen-fixing]] microorganisms, such as filamentous [[cyanobacteria]], possess the enzyme [[nitrogenase]], responsible for conversion of atmospheric N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into [[ammonia]]; molecular hydrogen is a byproduct of this reaction, and is many times not released by the microorganism, but rather taken up by a hydrogen-oxidizing (uptake) hydrogenase. One way of forcing these organisms to produce hydrogen is then to annihilate uptake hydrogenase activity. This has been done on a strain of ''[[Nostoc punctiforme]]'': one of the [[structural gene]]s of the NiFe uptake hydrogenase was inactivated by [[insertional mutagenesis]], and the mutant strain showed hydrogen evolution under illumination.&lt;ref name=Lindberg&gt;{{cite journal
|last=Lindberg|first=Pia|author2=Schûtz, Kathrin|author3= Happe, Thomas|author4= Lindblad, Peter

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of these photoautotrophs also have bidirectional hydrogenases, which can produce hydrogen under certain conditions. However, other energy-demanding [[metabolic pathway]]s can compete with the necessary electrons for proton reduction, decreasing the efficiency of the overall process; also, these hydrogenases are very sensitive to oxygen.&lt;ref name=Magnuson/&gt;

Several carbon-based biofuels have also been produced using cyanobacteria, such as 1-butanol.&lt;ref name=Lan&gt;{{cite journal

Synthetic biology techniques are predicted to be useful for this topic. Microbiological and enzymatic engineering have the potential of improving enzyme efficiency and robustness, as well as constructing new biofuel-producing metabolic pathways in photoautotrophs that previously lack them, or improving on the existing ones.&lt;ref name=Magnuson/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lan/&gt; Another topic being developed is the optimization of [[photobioreactor]]s for commercial application.&lt;ref name=Kunjapur&gt;{{cite journal

== Employed research techniques ==
Research in artificial photosynthesis is necessarily a multidisciplinary topic, requiring a multitude of different expertise.&lt;ref name=Magnuson/&gt; Some techniques employed in making and investigating catalysts and solar cells include:
*[[organic synthesis|Organic]] and [[inorganic chemistry|inorganic]] [[chemical synthesis]].
*[[Electrochemistry]] methods, such as [[photoelectrochemistry]], [[cyclic voltammetry]], electrochemical impedance spectroscopy [[Dielectric spectroscopy]], and [[bulk electrolysis]].
*Spectroscopic methods:
**fast techniques, such as [[time-resolved spectroscopy]] and [[ultrafast laser spectroscopy]];
**magnetic resonance spectroscopies, such as [[nuclear magnetic resonance]], [[electron paramagnetic resonance]];
**X-ray spectroscopy methods, including x-ray absorption such as [[XANES]] and [[EXAFS]], but also x-ray emission.
*[[Crystallography]].
*[[Molecular biology]], [[microbiology]] and [[synthetic biology]] methodologies.

==Advantages, disadvantages, and efficiency==
Advantages of solar fuel production through artificial photosynthesis include:
* The solar energy can be immediately converted and stored. In [[photovoltaic]] cells, sunlight is converted into electricity and then converted again into chemical energy for storage, with some necessary loss of energy associated with the second conversion.
* The byproducts of these reactions are environmentally friendly. Artificially photosynthesized fuel would be a [[carbon-neutral]] source of energy, which could be used for transportation or homes.

Disadvantages include:
* Materials used for artificial photosynthesis often corrode in water, so they may be less stable than [[photovoltaics]] over long periods of time. Most hydrogen catalysts are very sensitive to oxygen, being inactivated or degraded in its presence; also, photodamage may occur over time.&lt;ref name=Andreiadis/&gt;&lt;ref name=Krassen/&gt;
* The cost is not (yet) advantageous enough to compete with [[fossil fuels]] as a commercially viable source of energy.&lt;ref name="economist1"/&gt;

A concern usually addressed in catalyst design is efficiency, in particular how much of the incident light can be used in a system in practice. This is comparable with [[photosynthetic efficiency]], where light-to-chemical-energy conversion is measured. Photosynthetic organisms are able to collect about 50% of incident solar radiation, however the theoretical limit of photosynthetic efficiency is 4.6 and 6.0% for C3 and C4 plants respectively.&lt;ref name=Blankenship&gt;{{cite journal

[[File:Kalesch a bateau, höger sida u överdrag - Livrustkammaren - 65269.tif|thumbnail|Barouche in [[Livrustkammaren]], Stockholm, Sweden ]]

A '''barouche''' is a large, open, four-wheeled [[carriage]], both heavy and luxurious, drawn by two horses. It was fashionable throughout the 19th century. Its body provides seats for four passengers, two back-seat passengers [[Vis-à-vis (carriage)|vis-à-vis]] two behind the coachman's high box-seat. A leather roof can be raised to give back-seat passengers some protection from the weather.

==Etymology==

''Barouche'' is an [[anglicisation]] of the [[German language|German]] word ''barutsche'', via the [[Italian language|Italian]] ''baroccio'' or ''biroccio'' and ultimately from the ancient Roman Empire's [[Latin language|Latin]] ''birotus'', "two-wheeled". The name thus became a [[misnomer]], as the later form of the carriage had four wheels. This is an etymological technicality; over a few thousand years, words change.

==Development and variations==
[[File:Kalesch a bateau, klädsel - Livrustkammaren - 82390.tif|thumb|left|Detail of door and seats]]
The barouche was based on an earlier style of carriage, the ''calash'' or ''calèche'': this was a light carriage with small wheels, inside seats for four passengers, a separate driver's seat and a folding top.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Journal of the Malta Historical Society|last=Ganado|first=Albert|date=2005|title=Bibliographical notes on Melitensia - 3|url=http://mhs.eu.pn/mh3/20053.html#_ftnref308|publisher=Melita Historica|volume=14|issue=2|page=173-174, see also footnote 8 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140421163335/http://mhs.eu.pn/mh3/20053.html|archive-date=21 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A folding calash top was a feature of two other types: the [[chaise]], a two-wheeled carriage for one or two persons, a body hung on leather straps or thorough-braces, usually drawn by one horse; and a [[Victoria (carriage)|victoria]], a low four-wheeled pleasure carriage for two with a raised seat in front for the driver. {{cn|date=April 2016}} A [[Victoria (carriage)|victoria]] is distinguished from a barouche by having fold-down occasional seating for the rear-facing passengers, instead of permanent front seats.

In [[Quebec]], [[Canada]], ''calèche'' refers to a two-wheeled [[horse-drawn vehicle]] with or without a folding top and with a driver's seat on the splashboard.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mccord-museum.qc.ca/en/collection/artifacts/MP-0000.25.1041 Musée McCord Museum - Caleche, Dufferin Terrace, Quebec City, QC, about 1920.] McCord Museum of Canadian History, Montreal, Quebec.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Philippines]], the ''[[kalesa]]'' is a one-horse descendant of [[Spanish colonization of the Philippines|Spanish Colonial]] calashes, and is a common sight in older cities such as [[Manila]] and [[Vigan]].{{when|date=February 2016}}

==Description of the barouche carriage==
[[File:Abraham Lincoln's carriage (barouche), c. 1860-1865, on loan from the Studebaker National Museum, view 1 - National Museum of American History - DSC00339.jpg|thumb|President Lincoln's barouche]]
A barouche was an expensive four-wheeled, shallow [[vehicle]] used in the 19th century with two double seats inside, arranged ''[[Vis-à-vis (carriage)|vis-à-vis]]'', so that the sitters on the front seat face those on the back seat. It has a soft [[Hood (soft top)|collapsible half-hood]] folding like a bellows over the back seat and a high outside box seat in front for the driver. The entire carriage is suspended on C springs and leather straps and more recently additional elliptical springs.

[[File:Prince William of Wales &amp; Prince Henry of Wales.jpg|left|thumb|Royal barouche in London, 2009.]]
It is drawn by a pair of [[Carriage horse|horse]]s and was used in the 19th century for display and summer leisure driving. Designed to give a powerful impression of luxury and elegance, the structure of the carriage is heavier than it looks because of the lack of a rigid roof structure.&lt;ref name=Ratcliffe /&gt;

A light barouche was a ''barouchet'' or ''barouchette''. A [[barouche-sociable]] was described as a cross between a barouche and a [[Victoria (carriage)|victoria]]. 

A barouche-landau is mentioned in ''[[Emma (novel)|Emma]]'', published in 1816 by [[Jane Austen]]. It "combines the best features of a barouche and a [[Landau (carriage)|landau]]". An illustration of the expensive and more rarely seen vehicle, on account of the expense, is shown in a paper by Ed Ratcliffe, citing editor R. W. Chapman's collection of the works of Jane Austen, in the volume Minor Works, as noted in Ratcliffe's sources.&lt;ref name=Ratcliffe&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jasnanorcal.org/inkwell/ink9 |title=Transports of Delight: How Jane Austen's Characters Got Around |author=Ratcliffe, Ed |publisher=Jane Austen Society of North America |location=Menlo Park, California |work=The Inkwell |year=2012 |accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
f

==In popular culture==
In the 1994 novel, "[[The Alienist]]", which is set in 1896, by [[Caleb Carr]] a frequently used mode of transportation for the characters is a caleche.

In the novels by Jane Austen, "Lady Dalrymple, Mr. and Mrs. Palmer, and Henry Crawford owned barouches" in which other characters rode, and Jane Austen herself on at least one occasion in 1813 rode in a barouche.&lt;ref name=Ratcliffe /&gt; Henry Crawford was a character in ''[[Mansfield Park]]'' and his barouche was the topic of two important scenes of the novel; Lady Dalrymple was in ''[[Persuasion (novel)|Persuasion]]'', while Mr and Mrs Palmer were characters in ''[[Sense and Sensibility]]''.

Barouche driving is mentioned as a fashionable pastime in Nice, Italy, in chapter 37 of "[[Little Women]]" by [[Louisa May Alcott]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1395">A '''bilepton''' is a hypothetical particle predicted by the minimal [[331 model]]. It is a spin one [[gauge boson]] which appears with single and double [[electric charge]] and with [[lepton number]] L=+2 and L=-2. It can mediate exotic processes such as V+A [[muon]] decay and [[muonium]]-antimuonium conversion. It can also give rise to exotic scattering processes such as electron plus electron goes to muon plus muon which is forbidden in the [[Standard Model]]. Detailed measurements made at the [[Paul Scherrer Institute]] (PSI) have searched for the exotic muon decay and placed a lower bound on the bilepton mass of about 1 TeV. Studies of muonium-antimuonium conversion, also at PSI, have imposed a similar bound. Higher statistics experiments are planned. The bilepton could alternatively be discovered in electron-electron collisions or in multi TeV proton-proton collisions at the [[Large Hadron Collider]].

This particle was at first misnamed "dilepton", with a different pre-existing usage; the present name was introduced in 1996.

'''''Blackout: Tomorrow Will Be Too Late''''' is a [[disaster]] [[Thriller (genre)|thriller]] book by the Austrian author [[Marc Elsberg]],  described by [[Penguin Books]] as "a 21st-century high-concept disaster thriller".&lt;ref name=Penguin/&gt;

Published in German in 2012, {{As of|2016|lc=y}} it had been translated into fifteen languages and sold a million copies worldwide.&lt;ref name=Penguin&gt;[https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/1111908/blackout/ ''Blackout'' (Marc Elsberg)], [[Penguin Books]] (page visited on 3 September 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; The English version was published in 2017.&lt;ref name=Penguin/&gt;

The novel is about a European [[power outage]] due to a [[cyberattack]]. For realism the book is written on the basis of interviews with [[Intelligence agency|intelligence]] and [[computer security]] officials.&lt;ref name=Gauquelin/&gt;

== Plot==

The novel starts with a collapse of [[electrical grid]]s across Europe, plunging the population into darkness and disaster.&lt;ref name=Penguin/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gauquelin&gt;{{fr}} Blaise Gauquelin, [http://next.liberation.fr/livres/2015/05/06/cout-de-la-panne_1294583 "Coût de la panne. Marc Elsberg plonge l’Europe dans le noir avec l’aide de hackers"], ''[[Libération]]'', 6 May 2015 (page visited on 4 September 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; The prolonged electricity cut causes major problems: no more [[petrol]], no telephone, no food in supermarkets, no [[cash machine]]s working, [[nuclear disaster]]s, etc.&lt;ref name=Gauquelin/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nico Fried, [http://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/zivilschutzkonzept-vater-der-porzellankiste-1.3134539 "Innenminister in der Kritik - De Maizière stellt Zivilschutzkonzept vor"], ''[[Süddeutsche Zeitung]]'', 24 August 2016 (accessed 4 September 2016). In this article, the German [[Federal Ministry of the Interior (Germany)|Federal Minister of the Interior]], [[Thomas de Maizière]], cites Marc Elsberg's book ''Blackout'' to illustrate the vulnerability of the power supply infrastructure.&lt;/ref&gt; A former computer hacker and IT professional tries to find out the root cause for this. While doing so he himself becomes a hunted person as officials find suspicious e-mails sent from his laptop and think that he is involved.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2438">'''Boggomoss''' is a local term used to describe a [[mound spring]] in the [[Taroom]] district in the [[Dawson River (Queensland)|Dawson River]] valley of Queensland, Australia. The accepted plural is boggomossi, however boggomosses and boggomoss are the more commonly used plural forms.

The origin of the term is not known, but is most likely a compound of the words [[bog]] and moss. Boggomoss creek in the Parish of Fernyside appears on very early maps.

Boggomosses range in form from small muddy swamps to elevated peat bogs or swamps, up to 150 meters across scattered among dry woodland communities, which form part of the Springsure Group of [[Great Artesian Basin]] springs. They are rich in invertebrates and form a vital chain of permanently moist oases in an otherwise dry environment.

Boggomosses are prevalent east of [[Taroom]] along the [[Dawson River (Queensland)|Dawson River]], near the Glebe Weir and south-east to Cockatoo Creek.

The [[Spring (hydrology)|spring]] flow rate is usually in the range of 0.5 to 2.0 litres per second (8th magnitude spring), however some large boggomosses have a flow rate of up to 10.0 litres per second (7th magnitude spring).

== Environment ==

A report commissioned by the [[Queensland]] Department of Environment defined four boggomoss vegetation types with distinct environmental relations:&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Fensham, R. J | author2=Wilson, B. A | author3=Queensland. Department of Natural Resources | author4=Queensland.

* Group 2 associated with fertile and heavy surface soils and relatively large mounds.
* Group 3 associated with fertile and heavy surface soils, but with little or no mound development (probably young springs).

'''Borsdane Wood''' is an [[Ancient woodland|Ancient Semi Natural Woodland]] in the [[Metropolitan Borough of Wigan]] and [[Metropolitan Borough of Bolton]], [[Greater Manchester]], England. It is believed to have been continuous woodland cover since before 1600 AD and is composed of native tree species that have not obviously been planted. Borsdane Wood was designated a [[Local Nature Reserve]] in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lnr.naturalengland.org.uk/Special/lnr/lnr_details.asp?C=18&amp;N=&amp;ID=57|series=Local Nature Reserves|title=Borsdane Wood|publisher=Natural England|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724020319/http://www.lnr.naturalengland.org.uk/Special/lnr/lnr_details.asp?C=18&amp;N=&amp;ID=57|archivedate=2011-07-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The wood consists of approximately 34&amp;nbsp;hectares (85 acres) of mixed broadleaf trees including species such as oak, ash, birch, cherry, hazel, hawthorn, blackthorn and dog rose, as well as areas of open ground. With trees many hundreds of years old the wood has remained relatively unchanged for centuries and is home to a wide variety of wildlife. The wood follows the course of the [[Borsdane Brook]] which is the boundary between [[Hindley, Greater Manchester|Hindley]] and [[Westhoughton]] and the Metropolitan Boroughs of Wigan and Bolton. The brook flows through [[Wigan]], [[Pennington Flash Country Park|Pennington Flash]] and into the [[Glaze Brook]].

From [[Hindley, Greater Manchester]] there are several entrances to the wood, one of which can be accessed from Hindley centre through Raynor Park or through the cemetery. A tunnel under the railway leads into woodland little changed in centuries. A path leads to [[Aspull, Greater Manchester]] where the access is located near the Gerrard Arms [[Public House]]. 

The town of [[Westhoughton]] is adjacent to the wood.

'''''Bundwerk''''' is a carpentry and rural architectural term from the 19th century for a method of  building with timber that was used especially in [[Austria]], [[South Tyrol]] and [[Bavaria]]. After [[log construction]] and [[timber framing]], ''bundwerk'' is one of the most widespread forms of [[framing (construction)|timber building techniques]]. It involved used wooden beams that were arranged partly in a lattice or diagonally over a cross. It often decorated the front and gable sides of agricultural buildings, frequently the grain barn or ''Stadel'' of quadrangular farms (''Vierseithöfen'').

In northeastern [[Upper Bavaria]] ''bundwerk'' is especially varied and colourful. By contrast, in the [[Werdenfelser Land]] and the region around [[Innsbruck]] only a few places exhibit this type of timber building throughout.

''Bundwerk'' had its heyday between 1830 and 1860 when artists and woodcarvers, as well as carpenters, decorated the ''bundwerk'' with paintings and carvings, often with mythical creatures or Christian symbols.

[[File:Bouteille air démarrage.JPG|thumb|A pressurized air tank used to start a diesel generator set in Paris Metro]]
'''Compressed air energy storage''' (CAES) is a way to [[energy storage|store energy]] generated at one time for use at another time using [[compressed air]]. At utility scale, energy generated during periods of low energy demand (off-peak) can be released to meet higher demand ([[peak load]]) periods.&lt;ref name="NYT-2010.07.28"&gt;Wild, Matthew, L. [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/28/business/energy-environment/28storage.html Wind Drives Growing Use of Batteries], ''[[The New York Times]]'', July 28, 2010, pp.B1.&lt;/ref&gt; Small scale systems have long been used in such applications as propulsion of [[Fireless locomotive|mine locomotives]]. Large scale applications must conserve the heat energy associated with compressing air; dissipating heat lowers the energy efficiency of the storage system.

== Types ==
[[Gas compressor|Compression]] of [[air]] creates heat; the air is warmer after compression. [[Thermal expansion|Expansion]] removes heat. If no extra heat is added, the air will be much colder after expansion. If the heat generated during compression can be stored and used during expansion, the efficiency of the storage improves considerably.&lt;ref name="NYTimes-2012.10.01"&gt;Gies, Erica. [https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/02/business/energy-environment/a-storage-solution-is-in-the-air.html?pagewanted=all Global Clean Energy: A Storage Solution Is in the Air], ''[[International Herald Tribune]]'', October 1, 2012. Retrieved from NYTimes.com website, March 19, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; There are three ways in which a CAES system can deal with the heat. Air storage can be [[adiabatic]], [[diabatic]], or [[isothermal]].

===Adiabatic===
Adiabatic storage continues to keep the heat produced by compression and returns it to the air as it is expanded to generate power. This is a subject of ongoing study, with no utility scale plants as of 2015, but a German project ADELE is planning to bring a demonstration plant (360&amp;nbsp;[[MWh]] storage capacity) into service in 2016.&lt;ref name="ADELE1"&gt;{{cite web| title = ADELE – Adiabatic compressed-air energy storage (CAES) for electricity supply| url = http://kraftwerkforschung.info/en/storing-electricity-using-compressed-air/| accessdate = December 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theoretical [[Energy conversion efficiency|efficiency]] of adiabatic storage approaches 100% with perfect insulation, but in practice round trip efficiency is expected to be 70%.&lt;ref name="BINE1"&gt;{{cite web| title = German AACAES project information| url = http://www.bine.info/fileadmin/content/Publikationen/Englische_Infos/projekt_0507_engl_internetx.pdf| accessdate = February 22, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heat can be stored in a solid such as concrete or stone, or more likely in a fluid such as hot oil (up to 300&amp;nbsp;°C) or molten salt solutions (600&amp;nbsp;°C).

===Diabatic===
Diabatic storage dissipates much of the heat of compression with [[intercooler]]s (thus approaching isothermal compression) into the atmosphere as waste; essentially wasting, thereby, the renewable energy used to perform the work of compression. Upon removal from storage, the temperature of this compressed air is ''the one indicator'' of the amount of stored energy that remains in this air. Consequently, if the air temperature is low for the [[energy recovery]] process, the air must be substantially re-heated prior to expansion in the [[turbine]] to power a [[Electrical generator|generator]]. This reheating can be accomplished with a natural gas fired burner for [[utility]] grade storage or with a heated metal mass. As recovery is often most needed when renewable sources are quiescent, fuel must be burned to make up for the ''wasted'' heat. This degrades the efficiency of the storage-recovery cycle; and while this approach is relatively simple, the burning of fuel adds to the cost of the recovered electrical energy and compromises the ecological benefits associated with most renewable energy sources. Nevertheless, this is thus far the only system which has been implemented commercially.

The McIntosh, Alabama CAES plant requires 2.5&amp;nbsp;MJ of electricity and 1.2&amp;nbsp;MJ [[lower heating value]] (LHV) of gas for each MJ of energy output, corresponding to an energy recovery efficiency of about 27%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://my.epri.com/portal/server.pt?Abstract_id=TR-101751-V2 |title=EPRI &amp;#124; Product Abstract |publisher=My.epri.com |accessdate=2014-05-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121016102947/http://my.epri.com/portal/server.pt?Abstract_id=TR-101751-V2 |archivedate=October 16, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[General Electric]] 7FA 2x1 [[combined cycle]] plant, one of the most efficient natural gas plants in operation, uses 1.85&amp;nbsp;MJ (LHV) of gas per MJ generated,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.westgov.org/wieb/electric/Transmission%20Protocol/SSG-WI/pnw_5pp_02.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-01-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080411124518/http://www.westgov.org/wieb/electric/Transmission%20Protocol/SSG-WI/pnw_5pp_02.pdf |archivedate=April 11, 2008 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; a 54% thermal efficiency.

===Isothermal===
Isothermal compression and expansion approaches attempt to maintain [[operating temperature]] by constant heat exchange to the environment. They are only practical for low power levels, without very effective [[heat exchanger]]s. The theoretical efficiency of isothermal energy storage approaches 100% for perfect heat transfer to the environment. In practice neither of these perfect thermodynamic cycles is obtainable, as some heat losses are unavoidable.

=== Near Isothermal ===
Near isothermal compression (and expansion) is a process in which a gas is compressed in very close proximity to a large incompressible thermal mass such as a heat absorbing and releasing structure (HARS) or a water spray. A HARS is usually made up of a series of parallel fins. As the gas is compressed the heat of compression is rapidly transferred to the thermal mass, so the gas temperature is stabilised. An external cooling circuit is then used to maintain the temperature of the thermal mass. 
The isothermal efficiency (Z)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fluidmechanics.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Calculating-Isothermal-Efficiency-V1.2.pdf |title=Calculating Isothermal Efficiency |date=2015 |website=www.fluidmechanics.co.uk|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a measure of where the process lies between an adiabatic and isothermal process. If the efficiency is 0%, then it is totally adiabatic; with an efficiency of 100%, it is totally isothermal. Typically with a near isothermal process an efficiency of 90-95% can be expected.

===Other===
One implementation of isothermal CAES uses high, medium and low pressure pistons in series, with each stage followed by an airblast [[venturi pump]] that draws ambient air over an air-to-air (or air-to-seawater) heat exchanger between each expansion stage. Early [[Torpedo#Compressed air|compressed air torpedo]] designs used a similar approach, substituting seawater for air. The venturi warms the [[exhaust gas|exhaust]] of the preceding stage and admits this preheated air to the following stage. This approach was widely adopted in various compressed air vehicles such as [[H. K. Porter, Inc.]]'s mining [[locomotives]]&lt;ref &gt;{{cite web

==Compressors and expanders==
Compression can be done with electrically powered [[turbocompressor|turbo-compressor]]s and expansion with turbo 'expanders'&lt;ref name="DEP1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Distributed Energy Program: Compressed Air Energy Storage|url=http://www.eere.energy.gov/de/compressed_air.html|publisher=United States Department of Energy|accessdate=August 27, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[air engine]]s driving [[electrical generator]]s to produce electricity.

==Storage==
The storage system of a CAES (Compressed Air Energy Storage) is one of the most interesting characteristics of this technology, and it is strictly related to its economic feasibility, energy density and flexibility. There are a few categories of air storage vessels, based on the thermodynamic conditions of the storage, and on the technology chosen:

# Constant Volume Storage (Solution mined caverns, aboveground vessels, aquifers, automotive applications, etc.)
# Constant Pressure Storage (Underwater pressure vessels, Hybrid Pumped Hydro - Compressed Air Storage)

=== Constant Volume Storage === 
This storage system uses a chamber with specific boundaries to store large amounts of air. This means from a thermodynamic point of view, that this system is a Constant Volume and Variable Pressure system. This causes some operational problems to the compressors and turbines operating on them, so the pressure variations have to be kept below a certain limit, as do the stresses induced on the storage vessels.&lt;ref name=PRIN_WP&gt;{{cite web|title=Compressed Air Energy Storage: Theory, Resources, And Applications For Wind Power|url=http://www.princeton.edu/pei/energy/publications/texts/SuccarWilliams_PEI_CAES_2008April8.pdf|archive-url=http://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20120119134651/http://www.princeton.edu/pei/energy/publications/texts/SuccarWilliams_PEI_CAES_2008April8.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=January 19, 2012|accessdate=June 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The storage vessel is often an underground cavern created by [[solution mining]] (salt is dissolved in water for extraction)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.answers.com/topic/solution-mining?cat=technology ; {{cite web |url=http://www.saltinstitute.org/12.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-10-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017181924/http://saltinstitute.org/12.html |archivedate=October 17, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; or by utilizing an abandoned [[mining|mine]]; use of porous rock formations (rocks which have holes through which liquid or air can pass), such as those in which reservoirs of natural gas are found, has also been studied.&lt;ref name=PNNL413&gt;{{cite web|title=Compressed Air Energy Storage|url=http://caes.pnnl.gov/|publisher=Pacific Northwest National Laboratory|accessdate=May 20, 2013|date=April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cases also an above ground pipeline was tested as a storage system, giving some good results. Obviously the cost of the system is higher, but it can be placed wherever the designer chooses, while an underground system needs some particular geologic formations (salt domes, aquifers, depleted gas mines, etc.).&lt;ref name=PRIN_WP/&gt;

=== Constant Pressure Storage ===
In this case the storage vessel is kept at a constant pressure, while the gas is contained in a variable volume vessel. Many types of storage vessel have been proposed, but the operating conditions follow the same principle: The storage vessel is positioned hundreds of meters underwater and the hydrostatic pressure of the water column above the storage vessel allows maintaining the pressure at the desired level.

This configuration allows:
* Improve the energy density of the storage system, because all the air contained can be used (the pressure is constant in all charge conditions, full or empty, the pressure is the same, so the turbine has no problem exploiting it, while with constant volume systems after a while the pressure goes below a safety limit and the system needs to stop)
* Improve the efficiency of the turbomachinery, which will work under constant inlet conditions.
* Opens to the use of different geographic locations for the positioning of the CAES plant (coastal lines, floating platforms, etc.)&lt;ref name=OCAES&gt;{{cite web|title=Ocean Compressed Air Energy Storage (OCAES) Integrated with Offshore Renewable Energy Sources|url=http://repository.lib.ncsu.edu/ir/bitstream/1840.16/8878/1/etd.pdf|accessdate=June 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
On the other hand, the cost of this storage system is higher, due to the need of positioning the storage vessel on the bottom of the chosen water reservoir (often the sea or the ocean) and due to the cost of the vessel itself.&lt;ref name=OCAES /&gt;

Plants operate on a daily cycle, charging at night and discharging during the day. Heating of the compressed air using natural gas or geothermal heat to increase the amount of energy being extracted has been studied by the [[Pacific Northwest National Laboratory]]&lt;ref name=PNNL413 /&gt;

Compressed air energy storage can also be employed on a smaller scale such as exploited by [[air car]]s and air-driven [[locomotive]]s, and can use high-strength [[carbon-fiber]] air storage tanks. In order to retain the energy stored in compressed air, this tank should be thermally isolated from the environment; else, the energy stored will escape under the form of heat since compressing air raises its temperature.

== History ==
===Transmission===
{{split section|History of pneumatic power|date=November 2015}}
Citywide compressed air energy systems have been built since 1870.&lt;ref name=chambers&gt;{{cite book| title = Chambers's Encyclopaedia: A Dictionary of Universal Knowledge| date = 1896| publisher=W. &amp; R. Chambers, LTD| pages = 252–253| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=4pwMAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA252| accessdate = January 7, 2009}}

&lt;/ref&gt; Cities such as [[Paris, France]]; [[Birmingham, England]]; [[Dresden, Germany|Dresden]], [[Rixdorf]] and [[Offenbach, Germany]] and [[Buenos Aires, Argentina]] installed such systems. [[Victor Popp]] constructed the first systems to power clocks by sending a pulse of air every minute to change their pointer arms. They quickly evolved to deliver power to homes and industry.&lt;ref&gt;''Technische Mislukkingen,'' by Lex Veldhoen &amp; [[Jan van den Ende]], 1995/2013&lt;/ref&gt; As of 1896, the Paris system had 2.2&amp;nbsp;MW of generation distributed at 550&amp;nbsp;kPa in 50&amp;nbsp;km of air pipes for motors in light and heavy industry. Usage was measured by cubic meters.&lt;ref name=chambers/&gt; The systems were the main source of house-delivered energy in those days and also powered the machines of [[dentistry|dentists]], [[seamstress]]es, printing facilities and [[bakery|bakeries]].

===Storage===
* 1978 – The first utility-scale compressed air energy storage project was the 290 megawatt [[Huntorf]] plant in Germany using a salt dome.
* 1991 – A 110 megawatt plant with a capacity of 26 hours was built in McIntosh, Alabama (1991). The Alabama facility's $65 million cost works out to $590 per kW of generation capacity and about $23 per kW-hr of storage capacity, using a 19 million cubic foot [[In-situ leach|solution mined]] salt cavern to store air at up to 1100 psi. Although the compression phase is approximately 82% efficient, the expansion phase requires combustion of natural gas at one third the rate of a gas turbine producing the same amount of electricity.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.dresser-rand.com/literature/general/85164-10-CAES.pdf|format=PDF|title=Compressed Air Storage (CAES)|publisher=Dresser-Rand Corporation|id=brochure form# 85230|date=2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120907175639/http://www.dresser-rand.com/literature/general/85164-10-CAES.pdf|archivedate=September 7, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|work=The New York Times|date=September 29, 1991|last=Wald|first=Matthew |title=Using Compressed Air To Store Up Electricity|url= https://www.nytimes.com/1991/09/29/business/technology-using-compressed-air-to-store-up-electricity.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|accessdate=April 15, 2012|date=2010 |publisher=PowerSouth Energy Cooperative|url= http://www.powersouth.com/mcintosh_power_plant/compressed_air_energy |title=CAES:McIntosh Power Plant }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Storage thermodynamics ==
In order to achieve a near [[Reversible process (thermodynamics)|thermodynamic reversible process]] so that most of the energy is saved in the system and can be retrieved, and losses are kept negligible, a near reversible [[isothermal process]] or an [[isentropic process]] is desired.&lt;ref name="NYTimes-2012.10.01" /&gt;

=== Isothermal Storage ===
In an [[isothermal process|isothermal]] compression process, the gas in the system is kept at a constant temperature throughout. This necessarily requires exchange of heat with the gas, otherwise the temperature would rise during charging and drop during discharge. This heat exchange can be achieved by heat exchangers (intercooling) between subsequent stages in the compressor, regulator and tank. To avoid wasted energy, the intercoolers must be optimised for high [[heat transfer]] and low pressure drop. Smaller compressors can approximate isothermal compression even without intercooling, due to the relatively high ratio of surface area to volume of the compression chamber and the resulting improvement in heat dissipation from the compressor body itself.

When one obtains perfect isothermal storage (and discharge), the process is said to be "reversible". This requires that the heat transfer between the surroundings and the gas occur over an infinitesimally small temperature difference. In that case, there is no [[exergy]] loss in the heat transfer process, and so the compression work can be completely recovered as expansion work: 100% storage efficiency. However, in practice, there is always a temperature difference in any heat transfer process, and so all practical energy storage obtains efficiencies lower than 100%.

To estimate the compression/expansion work in an isothermal process, it may be assumed that the compressed air obeys the [[ideal gas law]],
:&lt;math&gt;pV=nRT=\operatorname{constant}&lt;/math&gt;.
From a process from an initial state ''A'' to a final state ''B'', with [[absolute temperature]] &lt;math&gt;T = T_A = T_B&lt;/math&gt; constant, one finds the work required for compression (negative) or done by the expansion (positive), to be
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
W_{A\to B} &amp; = \int_{V_A}^{V_B} p dV = \int_{V_A}^{V_B} \frac{nRT}{V} dV = nRT\int_{V_A}^{V_B} \frac{1}{V} dV \\
 &amp; = nRT(\ln{V_B}-\ln{V_A}) = nRT\ln{\frac{V_B}{V_A}} = nRT\ln{\frac{p_A}{p_B}} = p_A V_A\ln{\frac{p_A}{p_B}} \\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;,
where &lt;math&gt;pV = p_A V_A = p_B V_B&lt;/math&gt;, and so, &lt;math&gt;\frac{V_B}{V_A} = \frac{p_A}{p_B} &lt;/math&gt;. Here, &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is the absolute [[pressure]],
&lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is the [[volume]] of the vessel, &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is the [[amount of substance]] of gas (mol) and &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is the [[ideal gas constant]].

If there is a constant pressure outside of the vessel which is equal to the starting pressure &lt;math&gt;p_A&lt;/math&gt;, the positive work of the outer pressure reduces the exploitable energy (negative value). This adds a term to the equation above:
:&lt;math&gt;W_{A\to B} = p_A V_A\ln{\frac{p_A}{p_B}} + (V_A-V_B)p_A = p_B V_B\ln{\frac{p_A}{p_B}} + (p_B-p_A)V_B&lt;/math&gt;

{{anchor|Example}}
''Example''

How much energy can be stored in a 1&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; storage vessel at a pressure of {{convert|70|bar|MPa}}, if the ambient pressure is {{convert|1|bar|MPa}}. In this case, the process work is

:&lt;math&gt;W = p_B V_B \ln \frac{p_A}{p_B} + (p_B-p_A)V_B&lt;/math&gt; = 
:= 7.0&amp;nbsp;MPa × 1&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; × ln(0.1&amp;nbsp;MPa/7.0&amp;nbsp;MPa) + (7.0&amp;nbsp;MPa - 0.1&amp;nbsp;MPa) x 1&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = -22.8&amp;nbsp;MJ (equivalently 6.33&amp;nbsp;KWh).

The negative sign means that work is done on the gas by the surroundings. Process irreversibilities (such as in heat transfer) will result in less energy being recovered from the expansion process than is required for the compression process. If the environment is at a constant temperature, for example, the thermal resistance in the intercoolers will mean that the compression occurs at a temperature somewhat higher than the ambient temperature, and the expansion will occur at a temperature somewhat lower than ambient temperature. So a perfect isothermal storage system is impossible to achieve.

=== Adiabatic (isentropic) storage ===
An [[adiabatic process]] is one where there is no heat transfer between the fluid and the surroundings: the system is insulated against heat transfer. If the process is furthermore internally reversible (smooth, slow and frictionless, to the ideal limit) then it will additionally be [[isentropic]].

An adiabatic storage system does away with the intercooling during the compression process, and simply allows the gas to heat up during compression, and likewise to cool down during expansion. This is attractive, since the energy losses associated with the heat transfer are avoided, but the downside is that the storage vessel must be insulated against heat loss. It should also be mentioned that real compressors and turbines are not isentropic, but instead have an [[Steam turbine#Isentropic efficiency|isentropic efficiency]] of around 85%, with the result that round-trip storage efficiency for adiabatic systems is also considerably less than perfect.

=== Large storage system thermodynamics ===
Energy storage systems often use large underground caverns. This is the preferred system design, due to the very large volume, and thus the large quantity of energy that can be stored with only a small pressure change. The cavern space can be easily insulated, compressed adiabatically with little temperature change (approaching a reversible isothermal system) and heat loss (approaching an isentropic system). This advantage is in addition to the low cost of constructing the gas storage system, using the underground walls to assist in containing the pressure.

Recently there have been developed undersea insulated air bags, with similar thermodynamic properties to large underground cavern storage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cleantechnica.com/2011/04/18/energy-bags-under-the-sea-to-be-tested-to-store-off-shore-wind/ Energy bags under the sea to be tested] in 2011(Cleantechnica website). See in sections below.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Practical constraints in transportation ==
In order to use air storage in vehicles or aircraft for practical land or air transportation, the energy storage system must be compact and lightweight. [[Energy density]] and [[specific energy]] are the engineering terms that define these desired qualities.

=== Specific energy, energy density and efficiency ===
As explained in the thermodynamics of gas storage section above, compressing air heats it and expanding it cools it. Therefore, practical air engines require heat exchangers in order to avoid excessively high or low temperatures and even so don't reach ideal constant temperature conditions, or ideal thermal insulation.

Nevertheless, as stated above, it is useful to describe the maximum energy storable using the isothermal case, which works out to about 100 kJ/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; [&amp;nbsp;ln(''P''&lt;sub&gt;''A''&lt;/sub&gt;/''P''&lt;sub&gt;''B''&lt;/sub&gt;)].

Thus if 1.0&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; of air from the atmosphere is very slowly compressed into a 5&amp;nbsp;L bottle at {{convert|20|MPa|bar|abbr=on}}, the potential energy stored is 530&amp;nbsp;kJ. A highly efficient air motor can transfer this into kinetic energy if it runs very slowly and manages to expand the air from its initial 20&amp;nbsp;MPa pressure down to 100&amp;nbsp;kPa (bottle completely "empty" at atmospheric pressure). Achieving high efficiency is a technical challenge both due to heat loss to the ambient and to unrecoverable internal gas heat.&lt;ref&gt;Heat loss of practical systems is explained in the [[#Thermodynamics of heat storage]] section.&lt;/ref&gt; If the bottle above is emptied to 1&amp;nbsp;MPa, the extractable energy is about 300&amp;nbsp;kJ at the motor shaft.

A standard 20&amp;nbsp;MPa, 5&amp;nbsp;L steel bottle has a mass of 7.5&amp;nbsp;kg, a superior one 5&amp;nbsp;kg. High-tensile strength fibers such as [[carbon-fiber]] or [[Kevlar]] can weigh below 2&amp;nbsp;kg in this size, consistent with the legal safety codes. One cubic meter of air at 20&amp;nbsp;°C has a mass of 1.204&amp;nbsp;kg at [[standard temperature and pressure]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/air-desity-specific-weight-d_600.html Air – Density and Specific Weight], The Engineering Toolbox&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, '''''theoretical''''' specific energies are from roughly 70&amp;nbsp;kJ/kg at the motor shaft for a plain steel bottle to 180&amp;nbsp;kJ/kg for an advanced fiber-wound one, whereas practical '''''achievable''''' specific energies for the same containers would be from 40 to 100&amp;nbsp;kJ/kg.

=== Comparison with batteries ===
Advanced fiber-reinforced bottles are comparable to the [[Rechargeable battery|rechargeable]] [[lead-acid battery]] in terms of energy density. Batteries provide nearly constant voltage over their entire charge level, whereas the pressure varies greatly while using a pressure vessel from full to empty. It is technically challenging to design air engines to maintain high efficiency and sufficient power over a wide range of pressures. Compressed air can transfer power at very high flux rates, which meets the principal acceleration and deceleration objectives of transportation systems, particularly for [[hybrid vehicles]].

Compressed air systems have advantages over conventional batteries including longer lifetimes of [[pressure vessel]]s and lower material toxicity. Newer battery designs such as those based on [[Lithium iron phosphate battery|Lithium Iron Phosphate]] chemistry suffer from neither of these problems. Compressed air costs are potentially lower; however advanced pressure vessels are costly to develop and safety-test and at present are more expensive than mass-produced batteries.

As with electric storage technology, compressed air is only as "clean" as the source of the energy that it stores. [[Life cycle assessment]] addresses the question of overall emissions from a given energy storage technology combined with a given mix of generation on a power grid.

=== Safety ===
As with most technologies, compressed air has safety concerns, mainly catastrophic tank rupture. Safety regulations make this a rare occurrence at the cost of higher weight and additional safety features such as pressure relief valves. Regulations may limit the legal working pressure to less than 40% of the rupture pressure for steel bottles ([[safety factor]] of 2.5), and less than 20% for fiber-wound bottles ([[safety factor]] of 5). Commercial designs adopt the [[ISO 11439]] standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail?csnumber=33298 |title=Gas cylinders – High pressure cylinders for the on-board storage of natural gas as a fuel for automotive vehicles |publisher=Iso.org |date=2013-05-27 |accessdate=2014-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; High pressure bottles are fairly strong so that they generally do not rupture in vehicle crashes.

== Vehicle applications ==
{{Main|Compressed air vehicles}}

=== History ===
Air engines have been used since the 19th century to power [[mining|mine]] [[locomotives]], pumps, drills and trams, via centralized, city-level, distribution. [[Racecar]]s use compressed air to start their [[internal combustion engine]] (ICE), and large [[Diesel engine]]s may have starting [[pneumatic motor]]s.

[[Image:Compressed Air Loco.jpg|thumb|right|A compressed air locomotive by [[H. K. Porter, Inc.]], in use at the [[Homestake Mine (South Dakota)|Homestake Mine]] between 1928 and 1961.]]

=== Engine ===
{{Main|Compressed air engine}}

A compressed air engine uses the expansion of compressed air to drive the pistons of an engine, turn the [[axle]], or to drive a [[turbine]].

The following methods can increase efficiency:
* A continuous expansion turbine at high efficiency
* Multiple expansion stages
* Use of waste heat, notably in a hybrid [[heat engine]] design
* Use of environmental heat

A highly efficient arrangement uses high, medium and low pressure pistons in series, with each stage followed by an airblast venturi that draws ambient air over an air-to-air [[heat exchanger]]. This warms the exhaust of the preceding stage and admits this preheated air to the following stage. The only exhaust gas from each stage is cold air which can be as cold as {{convert|−15|°C|°F}}; the cold air may be used for [[air conditioning]] in a car.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

Additional heat can be supplied by burning fuel as in 1904 for Whitehead's torpedoes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.btinternet.com/~philipr/torps.htm |title=A History of the Torpedo The Early Days |publisher=Archive.is |date=1999-09-18 |accessdate=2014-05-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120530070555/http://www.btinternet.com/~philipr/torps.htm |archivedate=May 30, 2012 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; This improves the range and speed available for a given tank volume at the cost of the additional fuel.

==== Cars ====
{{Main|Compressed-air vehicle|Compressed air car}}

Since about 1990 several companies have claimed to be developing compressed air cars, but none is available. Typically the main claimed advantages are: no roadside pollution, low cost, use of cooking oil for [[lubrication]], and integrated air conditioning.

The time required to refill a depleted tank is important for vehicle applications. "Volume transfer" moves pre-compressed air from a stationary tank to the vehicle tank almost instantaneously. Alternatively, a stationary or on-board [[Gas compressor|compressor]] can compress air on demand, possibly requiring several hours.

==== Ships ====
Large [[marine diesel engine]]s are started using compressed air, typically between 20 and 30 bar and stored in two or more large bottles, acting directly on the pistons via special starting valves to turn the crankshaft prior to beginning fuel injection. This arrangement is more compact and cheaper than an electric starter motor would be at such scales, and able to supply the necessary burst of extremely high power without placing a prohibitive load on the ship's electrical generators and distribution system. Compressed air is commonly also used, at lower pressures, to control the engine and act as the spring force acting on the cylinder exhaust valves, and to operate other auxiliary systems and power tools on board, sometimes including pneumatic [[PID controller]]s. One advantage of this approach is that in the event of an electrical blackout, ship systems powered by stored compressed air can continue functioning uninterrupted, and generators can be restarted without an electrical supply. Another is that pneumatic tools can be used in commonly wet environments without risk of electric shock.

==== Hybrid vehicles ====
{{Main|Hydraulic hybrid}}

While the air storage system offers a relatively low power density and vehicle range, its high efficiency is attractive for hybrid vehicles that use a conventional internal combustion engine as a main power source. The air storage can be used for [[regenerative braking]] and to optimize the cycle of the piston engine which is not equally efficient at all power/RPM levels.

[[Robert Bosch GmbH|Bosch]] and [[PSA Peugeot Citroën]] have developed a hybrid system that use hydraulics as a way to transfer energy to and from a compressed nitrogen tank. An up to 45% reduction in fuel consumption is claimed, corresponding to 2.9l/100&amp;nbsp;km (81 mpg, 69 g CO2/km) on the [[New European Driving Cycle|NEDC]] cycle for a compact frame like [[Peugeot 208]]. The system is claimed to be much more affordable than competing electric and flywheel [[KERS]] systems and is expected on road cars by 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greencarcongress.com/2013/01/psabosch-20130122.html |title=PSA Peugeot Citroën and Bosch developing hydraulic hybrid powertrain for passenger cars; 30% reduction in fuel consumption in NEDC, up to 45% urban; B-segment application in 2016 |publisher=Green Car Congress |date=2013-01-22 |accessdate=2014-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types of systems ==
=== Hybrid systems ===
[[Brayton cycle]] engines compress and heat air with a fuel suitable for an [[internal combustion engine]]. For example, natural gas or [[biogas]] heat compressed air, and then a conventional [[gas turbine]] engine or the rear portion of a [[jet engine]] expands it to produce work.

[[Compressed air engine]]s can recharge an [[Battery (electricity)|electric battery]]. The apparently defunct [[Energine]] promoted its Pne-PHEV or Pneumatic Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle-system.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.energine.com/phev/e_phev_03.php |title=Energine PHEV-system schematic |publisher=Energine.com |accessdate=2014-05-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140513011738/http://www.energine.com/phev/e_phev_03.php |archivedate=May 13, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Existing hybrid systems ====

==== Future hybrid systems ====
The Iowa Stored Energy Park (ISEP) will use [[aquifer]] storage rather than cavern storage. The displacement of water in the aquifer results in regulation of the air pressure by the constant hydrostatic pressure of the water. A spokesperson for ISEP claims, "you can optimize your equipment for better efficiency if you have a constant pressure."&lt;ref name="new.scientist.com/vol.195 no.2623 p.&amp;nbsp;45"/&gt; Power output of the McIntosh and Iowa systems is in the range of 2–300&amp;nbsp;MW.

Additional facilities are under development in [[Norton, Ohio]].

The RICAS2020 project attempts to use an abandoned mine for adiabatic CAES with heat recovery. The compression heat is stored in a tunnel section filled with loose stones,&lt;!--temperature gradient--&gt; so the compressed air is nearly cool when entering the main pressure storage chamber. The cool compressed air regains the heat stored in the stones when released back through a surface turbine, leading to a higher overall efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.ricas2020.eu/project-objectives/ |title=Project Objectives|work=RICAS |accessdate=20 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.tu.no/artikler/forskning-luft-kan-bli-verdens-neste-batteri/376666 |title=FORSKNING: Luft kan bli verdens neste "batteri"|work=[[Teknisk Ukeblad]] |accessdate=20 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Lake or ocean storage ===
Deep water in lakes and the ocean can provide pressure without requiring high-pressure vessels or drilling into salt caverns or aquifers.&lt;ref name='caes.aquifer'&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wapa.gov/es/pubs/ESB/2003/03Aug/esb084.htm |title=Wind plus compressed air equals efficient energy storage in Iowa proposal |accessdate=April 29, 2008 |work=Energy Services Bulletin website |publisher=Western Area Power Administration |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509104206/http://www.wapa.gov/es/pubs/esb/2003/03Aug/esb084.htm |archivedate=May 9, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The air goes into inexpensive, flexible containers such as plastic bags below in deep lakes or off sea coasts with steep drop-offs. Obstacles include the limited number of suitable locations and the need for high-pressure pipelines between the surface and the containers. Since the containers would be very inexpensive, the need for great pressure (and great depth) may not be as important. A key benefit of systems built on this concept is that charge and discharge pressures are a constant function of depth. [[Carnot heat engine|Carnot]] inefficiencies can thereby be reduced in the power plant. Carnot efficiency can be increased by using multiple charge and discharge stages and using inexpensive heat sources and sinks such as cold water from rivers or hot water from [[solar pond]]s. Ideally, the system must be very clever—for example, by cooling air before pumping on summer days. It must be engineered to avoid inefficiency, such as wasteful pressure changes caused by inadequate piping diameter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/patents?id=uno9AAAAEBAJ&amp;dq=4873828 Prior art].

A nearly [[Isobaric process|isobaric]] solution is possible if the compressed gas is used to drive a hydroelectric system. However, this solution requires large pressure tanks located on land (as well as the underwater air bags). Also, hydrogen gas is the preferred fluid, since other gases suffer from substantial hydrostatic pressures at even relatively modest depths (such as 500 meters).

E.ON, one of Europe's leading power and gas companies, has provided €1.4 million (£1.1 million) in funding to develop undersea air storage bags.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/news/pressreleases/2008/june/energybagsandsuperbatteries.aspx|title=Energy bags and super batteries|date=June 18, 2008|publisher=Nottingham University|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110203142906/http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/news/pressreleases/2008/june/energybagsandsuperbatteries.aspx|archivedate=February 3, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/nottinghamshire/7315059.stm|title=The man making 'wind bags'|date=March 26, 2008|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hydrostor in Canada is developing a commercial system of underwater storage "accumulators" for compressed air energy storage, starting at the 1 to 4&amp;nbsp;MW scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2011/07/09/hydrostor-power-storage-under-water|title=How Hydrostor Aims To Change The Power Game By Storing Energy Under Water|date=July 9, 2011|publisher=[[TechCrunch]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Near Isothermal === 
[[File:Crowley's isothermal compressor &amp; expander.jpg|thumb|Schematic views of a near isothermal compressor and expander. Left view with piston fully retracted right view with piston fully inserted.]]
A number of methods of near isothermal compression are being developed. Fluid Mechanics has a system with a heat absorbing and releasing structure (HARS) attached to a reciprocating piston.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fluidmechanics.co.uk/isothermal-compression/|title=Near Isothermal Compression and Expansion|author=|date=May 28, 2015|publisher=|accessdate=July 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Light Sail inject a water spray into a reciprocating cylinder.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} SustainX use an air water foam mix inside a compressor. All these systems ensure that the air is compressed with high [[thermal diffusivity]] compared to the speed of compression. Typically these compressors can run at speeds up to 1000 rpm. To ensure high thermal diffusivity the average distance a gas molecule is from a heat absorbing surface is about 0.5mm. These near isothermal compressors can also be used as near isothermal expanders and are being developed to improve the round trip efficiency of CASE.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="33150">In [[semiconductor]] production, '''doping''' is the  intentional introduction of impurities into an [[intrinsic semiconductor]] for the purpose of modulating its electrical, optical and structural properties. The doped material is referred to as an [[extrinsic semiconductor]]. A semiconductor doped to such high levels that it acts more like a [[conductor (material)|conductor]] than a semiconductor is referred to as a [[degenerate semiconductor]].

In the context of [[phosphor]]s and [[scintillator]]s, doping is better known as [[activator (phosphor)|activation]].  Doping is also used to control the color in some pigments.

==History==
The effects of semiconductor doping were long known empirically in such devices as [[crystal radio]] [[Cat's-whisker detector|detectors]] and [[selenium rectifiers]]. For instance, in 1885 [[Shelford Bidwell]], and in 1930 the German scientist Bernhard Gudden, each independently reported that the properties of semiconductors were due to the impurities contained within them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/site/transistorhistory/faraday-to-shockley |title=Faraday to Shockley – Transistor History |date= |accessdate=2016-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Theory of Metals |author=Wilson, A. H. |edition=2md |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m0g4AAAAIAAJ |year=1965 |publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The doping process was formally first developed by [[John Robert Woodyard]] working at [[Sperry Gyroscope Company]] during [[World War II]], with a US Patent issued in 1950.&lt;ref&gt;Woodyard, John R. "Nonlinear circuit device utilizing germanium" {{US patent|2530110}} filed, 1944, granted 1950&lt;/ref&gt; The demands of his work on [[radar]] denied Woodyard the opportunity to pursue research on semiconductor doping.

Similar work was performed at [[Bell Labs]] by [[Gordon K. Teal]] and [[Morgan Sparks]], with a US Patent issued in 1953.&lt;ref&gt;Sparks, Morgan and Teal, Gordon K. "Method of Making P-N Junctions in Semiconductor Materials", {{US patent|2631356}} (Filed June 15, 1950. Issued March 17, 1953)&lt;/ref&gt;

Woodyard's prior [[patent]] proved to be the grounds of extensive litigation by [[Sperry Rand]] .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|year=1985|work=University of California: In Memoriam|title=John Robert Woodyard, Electrical Engineering: Berkeley|accessdate=2007-08-12|url=http://content.cdlib.org/view?docId=hb4d5nb20m&amp;doc.view=frames&amp;chunk.id=div00182&amp;toc.depth=1&amp;toc.id=&amp;brand=calisphere}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Carrier concentration==
The concentration of dopant affects many electrical properties. Most important  is the material's [[charge carrier]] concentration. In an intrinsic semiconductor under [[thermal equilibrium]], the concentrations of [[electron]]s and [[electron hole|holes]] are equivalent. That is,

:&lt;math&gt;n = p = n_i.\ &lt;/math&gt;

In a non-intrinsic semiconductor under thermal equilibrium, the relation becomes (for low doping):

:&lt;math&gt;n_0 \cdot p_0 = n_i^2\ &lt;/math&gt;

where ''n&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the concentration of conducting electrons, ''p&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the electron hole concentration, and ''n&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the material's intrinsic carrier concentration. The intrinsic carrier concentration varies between materials and is dependent on temperature. [[Silicon]]'s ''n&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'', for example, is roughly 1.08×10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt; at 300 [[kelvin]]s, about [[room temperature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= Improved value for the silicon intrinsic carrier concentration from 275 to 375 K| journal= J. Appl. Phys.|volume= 70|issue= 2|page= 846 |year=1991|bibcode = 1991JAP....70..846S |doi = 10.1063/1.349645 | last1= Sproul| first1= A. B| last2= Green| first2= M. A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, increased doping leads to increased conductivity due to the higher concentration of carriers. Degenerate (very highly doped) semiconductors have conductivity levels comparable to [[metal]]s and are often used in [[integrated circuit]]s as a replacement for metal. Often superscript plus and minus symbols are used to denote relative doping concentration in semiconductors. For example, ''n&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;'' denotes an n-type semiconductor with a high, often degenerate, doping concentration. Similarly, ''p&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;'' would indicate a very lightly doped p-type material. Even degenerate levels of doping imply low concentrations of impurities with respect to the base semiconductor. In intrinsic [[crystalline silicon]], there are approximately 5×10&lt;sup&gt;22&lt;/sup&gt; atoms/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. Doping concentration for silicon semiconductors may range anywhere from 10&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;. Doping concentration above about 10&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt; is considered degenerate at room temperature. Degenerately doped silicon contains a proportion of impurity to silicon on the order of parts per thousand. This proportion may be reduced to parts per billion in very lightly doped silicon. Typical concentration values fall somewhere in this range and are tailored to produce the desired properties in the device that the semiconductor is intended for.

==Effect on band structure==

[[File:PN band.gif|thumb|500px|right|[[Band diagram]] of PN junction operation in forward bias mode showing reducing depletion width. Both p and n junctions are doped at a 1×10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; doping level, leading to built-in potential of ~0.59 V. Reducing depletion width can be inferred from the shrinking charge profile, as fewer dopants are exposed with increasing forward bias.]]
Doping a semiconductor in a good crystal introduces allowed energy states within the [[band gap]], but very close to the energy band that corresponds to the dopant type. In other words, [[Donor (semiconductors)|electron donor]] impurities create states near the [[valence and conduction bands|conduction band]] while [[acceptor (semiconductors)|electron acceptor]] impurities create states near the valence band. The gap between these energy states and the nearest energy band is usually referred to as dopant-site [[bonding energy]] or ''E&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;'' and is relatively small. For example, the ''E&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;'' for [[boron]] in silicon bulk is 0.045 eV, compared with silicon's band gap of about 1.12 eV. Because ''E&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;'' is so small, room temperature is hot enough to [[thermal ionization|thermally ionize]] practically all of the dopant atoms and create free [[charge carrier]]s in the conduction or valence bands.

Dopants also have the important effect of shifting the energy bands relative to the [[Fermi level]]. The energy band that corresponds with the dopant with the greatest concentration ends up closer to the Fermi level. Since the Fermi level must remain constant in a system in [[thermodynamic equilibrium]], stacking layers of materials with different properties leads to many useful electrical properties induced by [[band bending]], if the interfaces can be made cleanly enough. For example, the [[p-n junction]]'s properties are due to the band bending that happens as a result of the necessity to line up the bands in contacting regions of p-type and n-type material.
This effect is shown in a [[band diagram]]. The band diagram typically indicates the variation in the valence band and conduction band edges versus some spatial dimension, often denoted ''x''. The Fermi level is also usually indicated in the diagram. Sometimes the ''intrinsic Fermi level'', ''E&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'', which is the Fermi level in the absence of doping, is shown. These diagrams are useful in explaining the operation of many kinds of [[semiconductor device]]s.

===Relationship to carrier concentration (low doping)===

For low levels of doping, the relevant energy states are populated sparsely by electrons (conduction band) or holes (valence band). It is possible to write simple expressions for the electron and hole carrier concentrations, by ignoring Pauli exclusion (via [[Maxwell–Boltzmann statistics]]):
:&lt;math&gt;n_e = N_{\rm C}(T) \exp((E_{\rm F} - E_{\rm C})/kT), \quad n_h = N_{\rm V}(T) \exp((E_{\rm V} - E_{\rm F})/kT),&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|''E''&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the [[Fermi level]], {{math|''E''&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the minimum energy of the conduction band, and  {{math|''E''&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the maximum energy of the valence band. These are related to the value of the intrinsic concentration via&lt;ref name="green"&gt;{{Cite journal | author = Green, M. A. | title = Intrinsic concentration, effective densities of states, and effective mass in silicon | doi = 10.1063/1.345414 | journal = Journal of Applied Physics | volume = 67 | issue = 6 | page = 2944| year = 1990 | pmid =  | pmc = |bibcode = 1990JAP....67.2944G }}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;n_i^2 = n_h n_e = N_{\rm V}(T) N_{\rm C}(T) \exp((E_{\rm V}-E_{\rm C})/kT),&lt;/math&gt;
an expression which is independent of the doping level, since {{math|''E''&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; – ''E''&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;}} (the [[band gap]]) does not change with doping.

The concentration factors {{math|''N''&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;(''T'')}} and {{math|''N''&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;(''T'')}} are given by
:&lt;math&gt;N_{\rm C}(T) = 2(2\pi m_e^* kT/h^2)^{3/2} \quad N_{\rm V}(T) = 2(2\pi m_h^* kT/h^2)^{3/2}.&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|''m''&lt;sub&gt;''e''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;}} and {{math|''m''&lt;sub&gt;''h''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;}} are the [[effective mass (solid-state physics)|density of states effective masses]] of electrons and holes, respectively, quantities that are roughly constant over temperature.&lt;ref name="green"/&gt;

==Techniques of doping and synthesis==
The synthesis of n-type semiconductors may involve the use of [[Metalorganic vapour phase epitaxy|vapor-phase epitaxy]]. In vapor-phase epitaxy, a gas containing the negative dopant is passed over the substrate wafer. In the case of n-type GaAs doping, [[hydrogen sulfide]] is passed over the [[gallium arsenide]], and sulfur is incorporated into the structure.&lt;ref name=Schubert&gt;{{cite book|title= Doping in III-V Semiconductors |author= Schubert, E. F.|year=2005 |pages=241–243|isbn=978-0-521-01784-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process is characterized by a constant concentration of sulfur on the surface.&lt;ref name=Middleman&gt;{{cite book|title= Process Engineering Analysis in Semiconductor Device Fabrication|author= Middleman, S.|year=1993 |pages=29, 330–337|isbn=978-0-07-041853-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of semiconductors in general, only a very thin layer of the wafer needs to be doped in order to obtain the desired electronic properties.&lt;ref name=Deen&gt;{{cite book|title= Analysis of Transport Phenomena |author= Deen, William M.|year=1998 |pages=91–94|isbn=978-0-19-508494-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reaction conditions typically range from 600 to 800&amp;nbsp;°C for the n-doping with group VI elements,&lt;ref name= Schubert /&gt; and the time is typically 6–12 hours depending on the temperature.

==Process==
Some [[dopant]]s are added as the (usually [[silicon]]) [[boule (crystal)|boule]] is grown, giving each [[wafer (electronics)|wafer]] an almost uniform initial doping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Microelectronic Materials and Processes |last=Levy |first=Roland Albert |year=1989 |pages=6–7 |isbn=978-0-7923-0154-7 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wZPRPU6ne7UC&amp;pg=PA248#PPA1,M1 |accessdate=2008-02-23 |publisher=Kluwer Academic |location=Dordrecht}}&lt;/ref&gt; To define circuit elements, selected areas — typically controlled by [[photolithography]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.computerhistory.org/semiconductor/timeline/1955-Photolithography.html |title=Computer History Museum – The Silicon Engine&amp;#124;1955 – Photolithography Techniques Are Used to Make Silicon Devices |publisher=Computerhistory.org |date= |accessdate=2014-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; — are further doped by such processes as [[diffusion]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.computerhistory.org/semiconductor/timeline/1954-Diffusion.html Computer History Museum – The Silicon Engine] 1954 – Diffusion Process Developed for Transistors&lt;/ref&gt; and [[ion implantation]], the latter method being more popular in large production runs because of increased controllability.

Small numbers of dopant [[atom]]s can change the ability of a semiconductor to conduct electricity. When on the order of one dopant atom is added per 100 million atoms, the doping is said to be ''low'' or ''light''. When many more dopant atoms are added, on the order of one per ten thousand atoms, the doping is referred to as ''high'' or ''heavy''. This is often shown as ''n+'' for [[n-type semiconductor|n-type]] doping or ''p+'' for [[p-type semiconductor|p-type]] doping. (''See the article on [[semiconductors]] for a more detailed description of the doping mechanism.'')

==Dopant elements==

===Group IV semiconductors===
(Note: When discussing [[group (periodic table)|periodic table groups]], semiconductor physicists always use an older notation, not the current [[IUPAC]] group notation. For example, the [[carbon group]] is called "Group IV", not "Group 4".)

For the [[Carbon group|Group IV]] semiconductors such as [[diamond]], [[silicon]], [[germanium]], [[silicon carbide]], and [[silicon germanium]], the most common dopants are [[Acceptor (semiconductors)|acceptors]] from [[boron group|Group III]] or [[Donor (semiconductors)|donors]] from [[Nitrogen group|Group V]] elements. [[Boron]], [[arsenic]], [[phosphorus]], and occasionally [[gallium]] are used to dope silicon. Boron is the [[Acceptor (semiconductors)|p-type dopant]] of choice for silicon integrated circuit production because it diffuses at a rate that makes junction depths easily controllable. Phosphorus is typically used for bulk-doping of silicon wafers, while arsenic is used to diffuse junctions, because it diffuses more slowly than phosphorus and is thus more controllable.

By doping pure silicon with [[Nitrogen group|Group V]] elements such as phosphorus, extra [[valence electrons]] are added that become unbonded from individual atoms and allow the compound to be an electrically conductive [[n-type semiconductor]]. Doping with [[boron group|Group III]] elements, which are missing the fourth valence electron, creates "broken bonds" (holes) in the silicon lattice that are free to move. The result is an electrically conductive [[p-type semiconductor]]. In this context, a [[Nitrogen group|Group V]] element is said to behave as an electron '''donor''', and a [[boron group|group III]] element as an '''acceptor'''. This is a key concept in the physics of a [[p-n diode|diode]].

A very heavily doped semiconductor behaves more like a good conductor (metal) and thus exhibits more linear positive thermal coefficient. Such effect is used for instance in [[sensistor]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Cheruku, Dharma Raj and Krishna, Battula Tirumala (2008) ''Electronic Devices and Circuits'', 2nd edition, Delhi, India, {{ISBN|978-81-317-0098-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lower dosage of doping is used in other types (NTC or PTC) [[thermistor]]s.

===Silicon dopants===
*Acceptors, p-type
**'''Boron''' is a [[acceptor (semiconductors)|p-type dopant]]. Its [[diffusion]] rate allows easy control of junction depths. Common in CMOS technology. Can be added by diffusion of [[diborane]] gas. The only acceptor with sufficient solubility for efficient emitters in transistors and other applications requiring extremely high dopant concentrations. Boron diffuses about as fast as phosphorus.
**'''Aluminium''', used for deep p-diffusions. Not popular in VLSI and ULSI. Also a common unintentional impurity.&lt;ref name="crgrvlsi"/&gt;
**'''Gallium'''  is a dopant used for long-wavelength infrared photoconduction silicon detectors in the 8–14 &amp;micro;m atmospheric window.&lt;ref name="neutrondop"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jens Guldberg |title=Neutron-Transmutation-Doped Silicon |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yMLkBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA437 |date=2013 |publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media |isbn=978-1-4613-3261-9 |pages=437–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gallium-doped silicon is also promising for solar cells, due to its long minority carrier lifetime with no lifetime degradation; as such it is gaining importance as a replacement of boron doped substrates for solar cell applications.&lt;ref name="crgrvlsi"&gt;{{cite book|author=Eranna, Golla |title=Crystal Growth and Evaluation of Silicon for VLSI and ULSI |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S43SBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA253 |date=2014 |publisher=CRC Press |isbn=978-1-4822-3282-0 |pages=253–}}&lt;/ref&gt;
**'''Indium''' is a dopant used for long-wavelength infrared photoconduction silicon detectors in the 3–5 &amp;micro;m atmospheric window.&lt;ref name="neutrondop"/&gt;
*Donors, n-type
**'''Phosphorus''' is a [[donor (semiconductors)|n-type dopant]]. It diffuses fast, so is usually used for bulk doping, or for well formation. Used in solar cells. Can be added by diffusion of [[phosphine]] gas. Bulk doping can be achieved by [[nuclear transmutation]], by irradiation of pure silicon with [[neutron]]s in a [[nuclear reactor]]. Phosphorus also traps gold atoms, which otherwise quickly diffuse through silicon and act as recombination centers. 
**'''Arsenic''' is a n-type dopant. Its slower diffusion allows using it for diffused junctions. Used for buried layers. Has similar atomic radius to silicon, high concentrations can be achieved. Its diffusivity is about a tenth of phosphorus or boron, so is used where the dopant should stay in place during subsequent thermal processing. Useful for shallow diffusions where well-controlled abrupt boundary is desired. Preferred dopant in VLSI circuits. Preferred dopant in low resistivity ranges.&lt;ref name="crgrvlsi"/&gt;
**'''Antimony''' is a n-type dopant. It has a small diffusion coefficient. Used for buried layers. Has diffusivity similar to arsenic, is used as its alternative. Its diffusion is virtually purely substitutional, with no interstitials, so it is free of anomalous effects. For this superior property, it is sometimes used in VLSI instead of arsenic. Heavy doping with antimony is important for power devices. Heavily antimony-doped silicon has lower concentration of oxygen impurities; minimal autodoping effects make it suitable for epitaxial substrates.&lt;ref name="crgrvlsi"/&gt;
**'''Bismuth''' is a promising dopant for long-wavelength infrared photoconduction silicon detectors, a viable n-type alternative to the p-type gallium-doped material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|doi=10.1117/12.959299 |title=Bismuth-Doped Silicon: An Extrinsic Detector For Long-Wavelength Infrared (LWIR) Applications |volume=0244 |pages=2–8 |author=Parry, Christopher M. |series=Mosaic Focal Plane Methodologies I |year=1981 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
**'''Lithium''' is used for doping silicon for [[Radiation hardening|radiation hardened]] solar cells. The lithium presence anneals defects in the lattice produced by protons and neutrons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Rauschenbach, Hans S. |title=Solar Cell Array Design Handbook: The Principles and Technology of Photovoltaic Energy Conversion |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BAjsCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA157 |date=2012 |publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media |isbn=978-94-011-7915-7 |pages=157–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lithium can be introduced to boron-doped p+ silicon, in amounts low enough to maintain the p character of the material, or in large enough amount to counterdope it to low-resistivity n type.&lt;ref&gt;Weinberg, Irving and Brandhorst, Henry W. Jr. (1984) {{US patent|4608452}} "Lithium counterdoped silicon solar cell"&lt;/ref&gt;
*Other
**'''Germanium''' can be used for [[band gap]] engineering. Germanium layer also inhibits diffusion of boron during the annealing steps, allowing ultrashallow p-MOSFET junctions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iue.tuwien.ac.at/phd/wittmann/node7.html |title=2. Semiconductor Doping Technology |publisher=Iue.tuwien.ac.at |date=2002-02-01 |accessdate=2016-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Germanium bulk doping suppresses large void defects, increases internal gettering, and improves wafer mechanical strength.&lt;ref name="crgrvlsi"/&gt;
**'''Silicon''', '''germanium''' and '''xenon''' can be used as ion beams for pre-[[amorphous silicon|amorphization]] of silicon wafer surfaces. Formation of an amorphous layer beneath the surface allows forming ultrashallow junctions for p-MOSFETs.
**'''Nitrogen''' is important for growing defect-free silicon crystal. Improves mechanical strength of the lattice, increases bulk microdefect generation, suppresses vacancy agglomeration.&lt;ref name="crgrvlsi" /&gt;
**'''Gold''' and '''platinum''' are used for minority carrier lifetime control. They are used in some infrared detection applications. Gold introduces a donor level 0.35 eV above the valence band and an acceptor level 0.54 eV below the conduction band. Platinum introduces a donor level also at 0.35 eV above the valence band, but its acceptor level is only 0.26 eV below conduction band; as the acceptor level in n-type silicon is shallower, the space charge generation rate is lower and therefore the leakage current is also lower than for gold doping. At high injection levels platinum performs better for lifetime reduction. Reverse recovery of bipolar devices is more dependent on the low-level lifetime, and its reduction is better performed by gold. Gold provides a good tradeoff between forward voltage drop and reverse recovery time for fast switching bipolar devices, where charge stored in base and collector regions must be minimized. Conversely, in many power transistors a long minority carrier lifetime is required to achieve good gain, and the gold/platinum impurities must be kept low.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Blicher, Adolph |title=Field-Effect and Bipolar Power Transistor Physics |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kbsPxwGw5x8C&amp;pg=PA93 |date=2012 |publisher=Elsevier |isbn=978-0-323-15540-3 |pages=93–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Compensation==
In most cases many types of impurities will be present in the resultant doped semiconductor. If an equal number of donors and acceptors are present in the semiconductor, the extra core electrons provided by the former will be used to satisfy the broken bonds due to the latter, so that doping produces no free carriers of either type. This phenomenon is known as ''compensation'', and occurs at the [[p-n junction]] in the vast majority of semiconductor devices. Partial compensation, where donors outnumber acceptors or vice versa, allows device makers to repeatedly reverse (invert) the type of a given portion of the material by applying successively higher doses of dopants, so-called '''counterdoping'''. Most modern semiconductors are made by successive selective counterdoping steps to create the necessary P and N type areas.&lt;ref&gt;Hastings, Alan (2005) ''The Art of Analog Layout'', 2nd ed. {{ISBN|0131464108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although compensation can be used to increase or decrease the number of donors or acceptors, the electron and hole [[Electron mobility|mobility]] is always decreased by compensation because mobility is affected by the sum of the donor and acceptor ions.

==Doping in conductive polymers==
{{main article|Conductive polymer}}
&lt;!-- Copied from Conductive polymer --&gt;
[[Conductive polymer]]s can be doped by adding chemical reactants to [[oxidize]], or sometimes reduce, the system so that electrons are pushed into the conducting [[Atomic orbital|orbitals]] within the already potentially conducting system. There are two primary methods of doping a conductive polymer, both of which use an oxidation-reduction (i.e., [[redox]]) process.
# '''Chemical doping''' involves exposing a polymer such as [[melanin]], typically a [[thin film]], to an [[oxidant]] such as [[iodine]] or [[bromine]]. Alternatively, the polymer can be exposed to a [[Reducing agent|reductant]]; this method is far less common, and typically involves [[alkali metals]].
# '''Electrochemical doping''' involves suspending a polymer-coated, working [[electrode]] in an [[electrolyte]] solution in which the polymer is [[insoluble]] along with separate counter and reference electrodes. An electric [[potential difference]] is created between the electrodes that causes a charge and the appropriate counter [[ion]] from the [[electrolyte]] to enter the polymer in the form of electron addition (i.e., n-doping) or removal (i.e., p-doping).

N-doping is much less common because the [[Earth's atmosphere]] is [[oxygen]]-rich, thus creating an [[oxidizing]] environment. An electron-rich, n-doped polymer will react immediately with elemental oxygen to ''de-dope'' (i.e., reoxidize to the neutral state) the polymer. Thus, chemical n-doping must be performed in an environment of [[inert gas]] (e.g., [[argon]]). Electrochemical n-doping is far more common in research, because it is easier to exclude oxygen from a [[solvent]] in a sealed [[Laboratory flask|flask]]. However, it is unlikely that n-doped conductive polymers are available commercially.

== Doping in organic molecular semiconductors ==
Molecular dopants are preferred in doping molecular semiconductors due to their compatibilities of processing with the host, that is, similar evaporation temperatures or controllable solubility.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lin|first=Xin|last2=Wegner|first2=Berthold|last3=Lee|first3=Kyung Min|last4=Fusella|first4=Michael A.|last5=Zhang|first5=Fengyu|last6=Moudgil|first6=Karttikay|last7=Rand|first7=Barry P.|last8=Barlow|first8=Stephen|last9=Marder|first9=Seth R.|date=2017-11-13|title=Beating the thermodynamic limit with photo-activation of n-doping in organic semiconductors|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/nmat5027|journal=Nature Materials|volume=16|issue=12|pages=1209–1215|language=En|doi=10.1038/nmat5027|pmid=29170548|issn=1476-4660|bibcode=2017NatMa..16.1209L}}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides, molecular dopants are also benefitted from their relatively large size comparing metal ion dopants (such as Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and Mo&lt;sup&gt;6+&lt;/sup&gt;), which makes them have excellent spatial confinement in order to be used in multilayer structure, such as [[OLED]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s and [[Organic solar cell]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s. The typical p-type dopants are F4-TCNQ&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Salzmann|first=Ingo|last2=Heimel|first2=Georg|last3=Oehzelt|first3=Martin|last4=Winkler|first4=Stefanie|last5=Koch|first5=Norbert|date=2016-03-15|title=Molecular Electrical Doping of Organic Semiconductors: Fundamental Mechanisms and Emerging Dopant Design Rules|journal=Accounts of Chemical Research|volume=49|issue=3|pages=370–378|doi=10.1021/acs.accounts.5b00438|pmid=26854611|issn=0001-4842}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and Mo(tfd)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lin|first=Xin|last2=Purdum|first2=Geoffrey E.|last3=Zhang|first3=Yadong|last4=Barlow|first4=Stephen|last5=Marder|first5=Seth R.|last6=Loo|first6=Yueh-Lin|last7=Kahn|first7=Antoine|date=2016-04-26|title=Impact of a Low Concentration of Dopants on the Distribution of Gap States in a Molecular Semiconductor|journal=Chemistry of Materials|volume=28|issue=8|pages=2677–2684|doi=10.1021/acs.chemmater.6b00165|issn=0897-4756}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as the similar problem encountered in doping conductive polymers, air-stable n-dopants suitable for materials with low [[electron affinity]](EA) are still elusive. Recently, photo-activation with the combination of cleavable dimeric dopants, such as [RuCp&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;Mes]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, suggest a new path to realize effective n-doping in those low-EA materials.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Magnetic doping==
Research on magnetic doping has shown that considerable alteration of certain properties such as specific heat may be affected by small concentrations of an impurity; for example, dopant impurities in semiconducting [[ferromagnetic]] alloys can generate different properties as first predicted by White, Hogan, Suhl and Nakamura.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1103/PhysRev.188.870|title=Density of States of an Insulating Ferromagnetic Alloy|year=1969|author=Hogan, C. Michael |journal=Physical Review|volume=188|pages=870–874|bibcode = 1969PhRv..188..870H|issue=2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1103/PhysRevA.32.2530|pmid=9896377|title=Spin-wave-related period doublings and chaos under transverse pumping|year=1985|journal=Physical Review A|volume=32|issue=4|pages=2530–2533|bibcode = 1985PhRvA..32.2530Z |last1=Zhang|first1=X. Y|last2=Suhl|first2=H}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The inclusion of dopant elements to impart dilute magnetism is of growing significance in the field of [[Magnetic semiconductor]]s. The presence of disperse ferromagnetic species is key to the functionality of emerging [[Spintronics]], a class of systems that utilise electron spin in addition to charge. Using [[Density functional theory]](DFT) the temperature dependent magnetic behaviour of dopants within a given lattice can be modeled to identify candidate semiconductor systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Assadi| first1=M.H.N| last2=Hanaor| first2=D.A.H.| title= Theoretical study on copper's energetics and magnetism in TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; polymorphs| journal= Journal of Applied Physics| year=2013| volume=113| issue=23| pages= 233913–233913–5|url=https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1304/1304.1854.pdf| doi=10.1063/1.4811539| arxiv=1304.1854| bibcode=2013JAP...113w3913A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Single dopants in semiconductors ==
The sensitive dependence of a semiconductor's  properties on dopants has provided an extensive range of tunable phenomena to explore and apply to devices. It is possible to identify the effects of a solitary dopant on commercial device performance as well as on the fundamental properties of a semiconductor material. New applications have become available that require the discrete character of a single dopant, such as single-spin devices in the area of quantum information or single-dopant transistors. Dramatic advances in the past decade towards observing, controllably creating and manipulating single dopants, as well as their application in novel devices have allowed opening the new field of solotronics (solitary dopant optoelectronics).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| doi=10.1038/nmat2940 |title= Single dopants in semiconductors |year=2011|author=Koenraad, Paul M. and Flatté, Michael E. | journal=Nature Materials|volume=10|pages=91–100|bibcode = 2011NatMa..10...91K|issue=2| pmid=21258352}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Neutron transmutation doping ==
[[Neutron]] [[nuclear transmutation|transmutation]] doping (NTD) is an unusual doping method for special applications. Most commonly, it is used to dope silicon n-type in high-power electronics. It is based on the conversion of the Si-30 isotope into [[phosphorus]] atom by neutron absorption as follows:

:::&lt;math&gt;
^{30}\mathrm{Si} \, (n,\gamma) \, ^{31}\mathrm{Si} \rightarrow \, ^{31}\mathrm{P} + \beta^- \; (\mathrm{T}_{1/2} = 2.62 h). &lt;/math&gt; 
In practice, the silicon is typically placed near a [[nuclear reactor]] to receive the neutrons. As neutrons continue to pass through the silicon, more and more phosphorus atoms are produced by transmutation, and therefore the doping becomes more and more strongly n-type. NTD is a far less common doping method than diffusion or ion implantation, but it has the advantage of creating an extremely uniform dopant distribution.&lt;ref&gt;Baliga, B. J. (1987) ''Modern Power Devices'', John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York, p. 32. {{ISBN|0471819867}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Schmidt, P. E. and Vedde, J. |year=1998|chapter=High Resistivity NTD Production and Applications|title=Electrochemical Society Proceedings|volume=98-13|pages= 3|isbn=9781566772075}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modulation doping ==
[[Modulation doping]] is a synthesis technique in which the dopants are spatially separated from the carriers. In this way, carrier-donor scattering is suppressed, allowing very high mobility to be attained.

'''Dry lubricants''' or '''solid lubricants''' are materials that, despite being in the solid phase, are able to reduce [[friction]] between two surfaces sliding against each other without the need for a liquid oil medium.&lt;ref&gt;Thorsten Bartels et al. "Lubricants and Lubrication" in ''Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry'', 2005, Weinheim. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a15_423}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two main dry lubricants are [[graphite]] and [[molybdenum disulfide]]. They offer lubrication at temperatures higher than liquid and oil-based lubricants operate. Dry lubricants are often used in applications such as locks or dry lubricated bearings. Such materials can operate up to 350&amp;nbsp;°C (662&amp;nbsp;°F) in oxidizing environments and even higher in reducing / non-oxidizing environments (molybdenum disulfide up to 1100&amp;nbsp;°C, 2012&amp;nbsp;°F). The low-friction characteristics of most dry lubricants are attributed to a layered structure on the molecular level with weak bonding between layers. Such layers are able to slide relative to each other with minimal applied force, thus giving them their low friction properties.

However, a layered crystal structure alone is not necessarily sufficient for lubrication. In fact, there are some solids with non-lamellar structures that function well as dry lubricants in some applications. These include certain soft metals ([[indium]], [[lead]], [[silver]], [[tin]]), [[polytetrafluroethylene]], some solid oxides, rare-earth [[fluoride]]s, and even [[diamond]].{{Citation needed|reason=This claim needs a reliable source; mostly, diamond is used for exactly the opposite reason, to prevent two surfaces sliding|date=November 2012}}

Limited interest has been shown in low friction properties of [[compacted oxide glaze layer]]s formed at several hundred degrees Celsius in metallic sliding systems. However, practical use is still many years away due to their physically unstable nature.

The four most commonly used solid lubricants are:
# Graphite. Used in [[air compressor]]s, food industry, railway track joints, brass instrument valves, [[piano]] actions, open gear, [[ball bearing]]s, machine-shop works, etc. It is also very common for lubricating [[Lock (security device)|locks]], since a liquid lubricant allows particles to get stuck in the lock worsening the problem. It is often used to lubricate the internal moving parts of firearms in sandy environments.
# Molybdenum disulfide (MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). Used in [[CV joint]]s and space vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.tribonet.org/space-tribology-an-overview-of-application-of-tribology-in-space-technology/|title=Space tribology – An overview of application of tribology in space...|last=harshvs|date=2016-10-28|newspaper=tribonet|language=en-US|access-date=2016-12-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161203060817/http://www.tribonet.org/space-tribology-an-overview-of-application-of-tribology-in-space-technology/|archive-date=2016-12-03|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Does lubricate in vacuum.
# [[Boron nitride#Hexagonal BN|Hexagonal boron nitride]]. Used in space vehicles. Also called "white graphite."
# [[Tungsten disulfide]]. Similar usage as molybdenum disulfide, but due to the high cost only found in some dry lubricated bearings.

Graphite and molybdenum disulfide are the predominant materials used as dry lubricants.

==Structure-function relationship==
The [[lubricity]] of many solids is attributable to a lamellar structure. The lamellae orient parallel to the surface in the direction of motion and slide easily over each other resulting in low friction and preventing contact between sliding components even under high loads. Large particles perform best on rough surfaces at low speed, finer particles on smoother surfaces and at higher speeds. These materials may be added in the form of dry powder to liquid lubricants to modify or enhance their properties.

Other components that are useful solid lubricants include boron nitride, polytetrafluorethylene (PTFE), talc, [[calcium fluoride]], cerium fluoride, and tungsten disulfide.

== Applications ==
Solid lubricants are useful for conditions when conventional lubricants are inadequate, such as:
* Reciprocating motion. A typical application is a sliding or reciprocating motion that requires lubrication to minimize wear, as, for example, in gear and chain lubrication. Liquid lubricants will squeeze out while solid lubricants do not escape, preventing fretting, corrosion, and galling.
* Ceramics. Another application is for cases where chemically active lubricant additives have not been found for a particular surface, such as polymers and ceramics.
* High temperature. Graphite and MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; act as lubricants at high temperature and in oxidizing atmosphere environments, where liquid lubricants typically will not survive. A typical application include fasteners that are easily tightened and unscrewed after a long stay at high temperatures.
* Extreme contact pressures. The lamellar structure orients parallel to the sliding surface, resulting in high bearing-load combined with a low [[shear stress]]. Most applications in metal forming that involve plastic deformation use solid lubricants.

=== Graphite ===
[[Graphite]] is structurally composed of planes of polycyclic carbon atoms that are hexagonal in orientation. The distance of carbon atoms between planes is longer and, therefore, the bonding is weaker.

Graphite is best suited for lubrication in air. Water vapor is a necessary component for graphite lubrication. The adsorption of water reduces the bonding energy between the hexagonal planes of the graphite to a lower level than the adhesion energy between a substrate and the graphite. Because water vapor is a requirement for lubrication, graphite is not effective in vacuum.&lt;ref name=Graphite&gt;{{cite web|title=SKF DryLube bearings|url=http://www.skf.com/portal/skf/home/products?maincatalogue=1&amp;lang=en&amp;newlink=1_23_79|work=SKF dry lubricated bearings|publisher=SKF|accessdate=2 December 2011}}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because it is electrically conductive, graphite can promote [[Graphite#Other properties|galvanic corrosion]]. In an oxidative atmosphere, graphite is effective at high temperatures up to 450&amp;nbsp;°C continuously and can withstand much higher temperature peaks.

Graphite is characterized by two main groups: natural and synthetic.
* Synthetic graphite is a high temperature [[sintering|sintered]] product and is characterized by its high purity of carbon (99.5−99.9%). Primary grade synthetic graphite can approach the good lubricity of quality natural graphite.
* Natural graphite is derived from mining. The quality of natural graphite varies as a result of the ore quality and its post-mining processing. The end product is graphite with a content of carbon (high grade graphite 96−98% carbon), sulfur, SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and ash. The higher the carbon content and the degree of graphitization (high crystalline) the better the lubricity and resistance to oxidation.

For applications where only a minor lubricity is needed and a more thermally insulating coating is required, then amorphous graphite would be chosen (80% carbon).

=== [[Molybdenum disulfide]] ===
MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is mined from some sulfide-rich deposits and refined to achieve a purity suitable for lubricants. Like graphite, MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; has a hexagonal crystal structure with the intrinsic property of easy shear. MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; lubrication performance often exceeds that of graphite and is effective in vacuum as well, whereas graphite is not. The temperature limitation of MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; at 400&amp;nbsp;°C is restricted by oxidation. Particle size and film thickness are important parameters that should be matched to the surface roughness of the substrate. Large particles may result in excessive wear by abrasion caused by impurities in the MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and small particles may result in accelerated oxidation.

=== Boron nitride ===
[[Boron_nitride#Hexagonal_BN|Hexagonal boron nitride]] is a ceramic powder lubricant. The most interesting lubricant feature is its high temperature resistance of 1200&amp;nbsp;°C service temperature in an oxidizing atmosphere. Furthermore, boron nitride has a high thermal conductivity. (Cubic boron nitride is very hard and used as an abrasive and cutting tool component.)

=== Polytetrafluorethylene ===
[[Polytetrafluorethylene]] (PTFE) is widely used as an additive in lubricating oils and greases. Due to the low [[surface energy]] of PTFE, stable unflocculated dispersions of PTFE in oil or water can be produced. Contrary to the other solid lubricants discussed, PTFE does not have a layered structure. The macro molecules of PTFE slip easily along each other, similar to lamellar structures. PTFE shows one of the smallest coefficients of static and dynamic friction, down to 0.04. Operating temperatures are limited to about 260&amp;nbsp;°C.

== Application methods ==

=== Spraying/dipping/brushing ===
Dispersion of solid lubricant as an additive in oil, water, or grease is most commonly used. For parts that are inaccessible for lubrication after assembly, a dry film lubricant can be sprayed. After the solvent evaporates, the coating cures at room temperature to form a solid lubricant. Pastes are grease-like lubricants containing a high percentage of solid lubricants used for assembly and lubrication of highly loaded, slow-moving parts. Black pastes generally contain MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. For high temperatures above 500&amp;nbsp;°C, pastes are composed on the basis of metal powders to protect metal parts from oxidation necessary to facilitate disassembly of threaded connections and other assemblies.{{cn|date=August 2017}}

=== Free powders ===
Dry-powder tumbling is an effective application method. The bonding can be improved by prior phosphating of the substrate. Use of free powders has its limitations, since adhesion of the solid particles to the substrate is usually insufficient to provide any service life in continuous applications. However, to improve running-in conditions or in metal-forming processes, a short duration of the improved slide conditions may suffice.{{cn|date=August 2017}}

=== Anti-friction coatings ===
Anti-friction (AF) coatings are "lubricating paints" consisting of fine particles of lubricating pigments, such as molydisulfide, PTFE or graphite, blended with a binder. After application and proper curing, these "slippery" or dry lubricants bond to the metal surface and form a dark gray solid film. Many dry film lubricants contain special rust inhibitors which offer exceptional corrosion protection. Most long-wearing films are of the bonded type but are still restricted to applications where sliding distances are not too long. AF coatings are applied where fretting and galling is a problem (such as [[spline (mechanical)|spline]]s, [[universal joint]]s and keyed bearings), where operating pressures exceed the load-bearing capacities of ordinary oils and greases, where smooth running in is desired (piston, camshaft), where clean operation is desired (AF coatings will not collect dirt and debris like greases and oils), and where parts may be stored for long periods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Coating Terminology|url=http://www.decc.com/coating-terminology|website=DECC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Composites ===
Self-lubricating composites: Solid lubricants such as PTFE, graphite, MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and some other anti-friction and anti-wear additives are often compounded in polymers and all kind of sintered materials. MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, for example, is compounded in materials for sleeve bearings, elastomer [[O-ring]]s, carbon brushes, etc. Solid lubricants are compounded in plastics to form a "self-lubricating" or "internally lubricated" thermoplastic composite. For example, PTFE particles compounded in the plastic form a PTFE film over the mating surface, resulting in a reduction of friction and wear. MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; compounded in [[nylon]] reduces wear, friction and stick-slip. Furthermore, it acts as a nucleating agent effecting in a very fine crystalline structure. The primary use of graphite lubricated thermoplastics is in applications operating in aqueous environments.{{cn|date=August 2017}}

EcoSecurities is a business that sources and develops [[carbon credits]] and [[carbon offsets]] from [[greenhouse gas]] emission reduction projects throughout the world.

The company has offices in [[Europe]], [[Middle East]], [[Americas]] and [[Asia]] and has a large portfolio of green house gas emission reduction projects covering numerous countries and technologies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.climateneutral.unep.org/cnn_contentdetail.aspx?m=336&amp;amid=1870.html Climate Neutral Network], [[UNEP]], August 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

EcoSecurities was created in January 1997, 12 months before the Kyoto conference.  After a period of organic growth, the company floated on the [[Alternative Investment Market]] of the [[London Stock Exchange]] in December 2005, allowing it to grow its geographic presence by placing over 300 staff in 30 countries. Its portfolio grew to over 150 million CERs - the largest in the world at the time. In June 2007, the company raised an additional €100 million to expand into new markets, with [[Credit Suisse]] becoming a major investor. It trades in the international carbon market which was valued at €38 billion in the first six months of 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/analysis-and-features/market-meltdown-carbon-trading-is-just-warming-up-877996.html Market meltdown. Carbon Trading is just warning up, The Independent on Sunday, 27 July 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

The former President and co-founder of EcoSecurities was [[Pedro Moura Costa|Pedro Moura-Costa]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://ecosystemmarketplace.com/pages/article.people.profile.php?component_id=3582&amp;component_version_id=5125&amp;language_id=12 Ecosecurities Profile]&lt;/ref&gt; and the former [[CEO]] was Bruce Usher.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wbcsd.org/plugins/DocSearch/details.asp?type=DocDet&amp;ObjectId=MzEwODA INTERVIEW SERIES: Bruce Usher - CEO, EcoSecurities, 13 August 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of 2009 the firm was acquired by [[JP Morgan]] and is now an indirect wholly owned subsidiarly of JPMorgan Chase and Co. and can provide its clients with access to the scope of services provided by the bank's Environmental Markets business in addition to those activities of sourcing and developing greenhouse gas abatement projects outlined above.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpmorgan.com/pages/jpmorgan/investbk/solutions/commodities/environmental], [[JP Morgan]]&lt;/ref&gt; Following on from acquisition of EcoSecurities the company appointed Paul Mark Kelly as Chief Executive Officer of the company in December 2009,&lt;ref&gt;[http://uk.reuters.com/article/2009/11/09/ecosecuruties-ceo-idUKL936286520091109], [[Reuters]], December 2009,&lt;/ref&gt; when the company subsequently delisted from the [[Alternative Investment Market]] of the [[London Stock Exchange]].

== The compliance carbon market ==
EcoSecurities operates in both the compliance and voluntary carbon markets. In the compliance market, EcoSecurities implements projects in the developing world under the [[Kyoto Protocol]]'s [[Clean Development Mechanism]] to generate [[Certified Emission Reduction]]s which are used by governments and organisations under the  [[Kyoto Protocol]] and [[European Union]] [[Emissions Trading Scheme]].

Clean Development Mechanism projects that EcoSecurities has helped develop include:
* Novagerar landfill in Brazil, the first project registered with the CDM worldwide
* small scale hydroelectricity at Cuyamapa, [[Honduras]], the first to be issued with carbon credits by the CDM Executive Board 
* biomass to electricity for Celulose Irani [[Brazil]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wbcsd.org/plugins/DocSearch/details.asp?txtDocTitle=ecosecurities&amp;txtDocText=ecosecurities&amp;DocTypeId=-1&amp;ObjectId=Mjk5NjE&amp;URLBack=result%2Easp%3FtxtDocTitle%3Decosecurities%26txtDocText%3Decosecurities%26DocTypeId%3D%2D1%26SortOrder%3D%26CurPage%3D1.html Case Study, World Business Council for Sustainable Development 5 May 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The voluntary carbon market==
In the voluntary market EcoSecurities develops carbon projects to sell on different markets,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecosecurities.com/Home/Reducing_corporate_emissions/Carbon_offsetting/default.aspx Ecosecuties website] Carbon offsetting&lt;/ref&gt; including the Voluntary Carbon Standard, the [[California Climate Action Registry]] standard and The Gold Standard's Voluntary Emission Reduction standard. These are sold to organisations that have no regulatory obligation to offset their carbon emissions, but wish to do so on a voluntary basis, often as part of a [[carbon neutrality]] or [[corporate social responsibility]] programme.

Some of EcoSecurities' current and historic clients include [[Yahoo!]], Fortune Conferences and [[NetJets Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.netjetseurope.com/climate/eng/offsets.html Netjets offsetting]&lt;/ref&gt;

Voluntary emission reduction projects developed through EcoSecurities include
[[methane]] capture for dairies in the United States&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mydairyman.com/articles/?p=106.html Mydairyman.com 6 May 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; and SPM Group pig farms in [[Thailand]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1776">An '''Equivalent oxide thickness''' is a distance, usually given in [[nanometer]]s (nm), which indicates how thick a [[silicon oxide]] film would need to be to produce the same effect as the [[high-κ dielectric|high-κ]] material being used.  

The term is often used when describing [[field effect transistor]]s which rely on an electrically insulating pad of material between a [[Gate (transistor)|gate]] and a [[doping (semiconductor)|doped]] [[semiconductor|semiconducting]] region.  Device performance has typically been improved by reducing the thickness of a silicon oxide insulating pad.  As the thickness approached 5–10&amp;nbsp;nm, leakage became a problem and alternate materials were necessary to increase the thickness while retaining the switching speed.  Materials having larger dielectric constants enable thicker films to be used for this purpose while retaining fast reaction of the transistor.  For example, a high-κ material with [[dielectric constant]] of 39 (compared to 3.9 for silicon oxide) can be made ten times thicker than silicon oxide which helps to reduce the leakage of electrons across the dielectric pad, while achieving the same [[capacitance]]. Commonly used high-κ gate dielectrics include [[hafnium oxide]] and more recently [[aluminum oxide]] for [[multigate device|gate-all-around devices]]. 

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{EOT} = t_\text{high-κ} \left( \frac{k_{\text{SiO}_2}}{k_\text{high-κ}}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

The EOT definition is useful to quickly compare different [[dielectric]] materials to the industry standard silicon oxide dielectric, as:

:&lt;math&gt;\epsilon_0\, \epsilon_{\text{SiO}_2} \frac{A}{\mathrm{EOT}} = \epsilon_0 \, \epsilon_\text{high-κ} \, \frac{A}{t_\text{high-κ}} = C&lt;/math&gt;

'''Flash powder''' is a [[pyrotechnic composition]], a mixture of [[oxidizer]] and metallic [[fuel]], which burns quickly and if confined produces a loud [[Report (noise)|report]]. It is widely used in theatrical [[pyrotechnics]] and [[fireworks]] (namely [[salute (pyrotechnics)|salutes]], e.g., [[cherry bomb]]s, [[M-80 (explosive)|M-80]]s, [[firexploders]]s, and [[cap gun]] shots)  and was once used for [[flash (photography)|flash]]es in [[photography]].

[[Image:Flash Powders.JPG|thumb|right|Examples of theatrical binary flash powders.  Note the shared [[oxidizer]] (A) powder for some types of [[fuel]]s (B).]]

Different varieties of flash powder are made from different compositions; most common are [[potassium perchlorate]] and [[aluminium powder]]. Sometimes, [[sulfur]] is included in the mixture to increase the sensitivity. Early formulations used [[potassium chlorate]] instead of potassium perchlorate.

Flash powder compositions are also used in military pyrotechnics when production of large amount of noise, light, or infrared radiation is required, e.g., [[flare (countermeasure)|missile decoy flares]] and [[stun grenade]]s.

==History==

[[Lycopodium powder]] is a yellow-tan dust-like powder historically used as a flash powder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Photographic Times and American Photographer, vol.18|date=1888|publisher=Scovill Manufacturing Company|page=26|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8zlJAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA26&amp;lpg=PA26&amp;dq=lycopodium+powder+photography&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=7Y-hEj8T-S&amp;sig=40UovNr9vSgYOyUbU50pzjsnd7g&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjrjJr8-YbXAhWMQSYKHZyeAWMQ6AEIcjAS#v=onepage&amp;q=lycopodium%20powder%20photography&amp;f=false|accessdate=23 October 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the principal use of the powder is to create flashes or flames that are large and impressive but relatively easy to manage safely in [[magic (illusion)|magic]] acts and for [[movie theatre|cinema]] and [[theater|theatrical]] [[special effects]].

==Mixtures==

Normally, flash powder mixtures are compounded to achieve a particular purpose.  These mixtures range from extremely fast-burning mixtures designed to produce a maximum audio report, to mixtures designed to burn slowly and provide large amounts of illumination, to mixtures that were formerly used in photography.

===Aluminium and chlorate===
Because of the above-mentioned instability, the combination of [[aluminium powder]] and [[potassium chlorate]] is a poor choice for flash powder that is to be stored for more than a very short period.  For that reason, it has been largely replaced by the potassium perchlorate mixtures.  Chlorate mixes are used when cost is the overriding concern because potassium chlorate is less expensive than perchlorate.  It is critically important to exclude sulfur and any acidic components from these mixtures.  Sometimes a few percent of bicarbonate or carbonate buffer is added to the mixture to ensure the absence of acidic impurities.

: 6 KClO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 10 Al → 3 K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + 5 Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 3 Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

The composition is approximately 70% KClO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; : 30% Al by weight for the reactants of the above stoichiometrically balanced equation.

===Potassium nitrate, aluminium and sulfur===
This composition, usually in a ratio of 5 parts potassium nitrate, to 3 parts aluminium powder, to 2 parts sulfur, is especially popular with hobbyists. It is not very quick-burning, unless exceptionally fine ingredients are used. Although it incorporates sulfur, it is in fact fairly stable, sustaining multiple hits from a hammer onto a hard surface. Adding 2% of its weight with boric acid is reputed to significantly increase stability and shelf life, through resistance to dampening through ambient humidity. Other ratios such as 6 KNO3/3 Al/2 S and 5 KNO3/2 Al/3 S also exist and work. All ratios have similar burn times and strength, although 5 KNO3/3 Al/2 S seems to be dominant.

:2 KNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 4 Al + S → K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S + N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;

The composition is approximately 59% KNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; : 31.6% Al : 9.4% S by weight for the reactants of the above [[stoichiometric]]ally balanced equation.

For best results, "German Dark" aluminium should be used, with airfloat sulfur, and finely ball milled pure potassium nitrate. The finished mixture should never be ball milled together.

===Aluminium and perchlorate===
Aluminium powder and [[potassium perchlorate]] are the only two components of the pyrotechnic industry standard flash powder. It provides a great balance of stability and power, and is the composition used in most commercial exploding fireworks.

aka A B mixture

The balanced equation for the reaction is:

:3 KClO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + 8 Al → 3 KCl + 4 Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;

A ratio of seven parts potassium perchlorate to three parts dark pyro aluminium is the composition used by most pyrotechnicians. The stoichiometric ratio is 34.2% aluminum by mass to 65.8% perchlorate by mass. 

For best results, the aluminium powder should be "Dark Pyro" grade, with a flake particle shape, and a particle size of fewer than 10 micrometres.  The KClO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; should be in powder form, free from clumps. It can be sieved through a screen, if necessary, to remove any clumps prior to use. The particle size of the perchlorate is not as critical as that of the aluminium component, as much less energy is required to decompose the KClO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; than is needed to melt the aluminium into the liquid state required for the reaction.

Although this composition is fairly insensitive, it should be treated with care and respect.  Hobbyist pyrotechnicians usually use a method called ''diapering'', in which the materials are poured separately onto a large piece of paper, which is then alternately lifted at each corner to roll the composition over itself and mix the components. Some amateur pyrotechnicians choose to mix the composition by shaking in a closed paper container, as this is much quicker and more effective than diapering. One method of mixing flash is to put the components in the final device and handling the device will mix the flash powder.  Paper/cardboard is chosen over other materials such as plastic as a result of its favorable [[triboelectric]] properties.

Large quantities should never be mixed in a single batch. Large quantities are not only more difficult to handle safely, but they place innocent bystanders within the area at risk. In the event of accidental ignition, debris from a multiple-pound flash powder explosion can be thrown hundreds of feet with sufficient force to kill or injure.  (Note: 25&amp;nbsp;grams of mixture is enough to explode in open air without constraint other than air pressure.)

No matter the quantity, care must always be taken to prevent any electrostatic discharge or friction during mixing or handling, as these may cause accidental ignition.

===Magnesium and nitrate===
Another flash composition common among amateurs consists of [[magnesium]] powder and [[potassium nitrate]]. Other metal nitrates have been used, including [[Barium nitrate|barium]] and [[Strontium nitrate|strontium]] nitrates.  Compositions using [[nitrates|nitrate]] and [[magnesium]] metal have been used as photographic flash powders almost since the invention of photography. Potassium nitrate/magnesium flash powder should be mixed and used immediately and not stored due to its tendency of self-ignition.

If magnesium isn't a very fine powder it can be passivated with linseed oil or potassium dichromate.The passivated magnesium flash powder is stable and safe to store.

:2 KNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 5 Mg → K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 5 MgO
The composition is approximately 50% KNO3 : 50% Mg by weight for the reactants of the above stoichiometrically balanced equation. Below is the same reaction but invlolving [[barium nitrate]].

:Ba(NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 5 Mg → BaO + N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 5 MgO

Mixtures designed to make reports are substantially different from mixtures designed for illumination.  A stoichiometric ratio of three parts KNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; to two parts Mg is close to ideal and provides the most rapid burn. The magnesium powder should be smaller than 200 mesh, though up to 100 mesh will work. The potassium nitrate should be impalpable dust.  This mixture is popular in amateur pyrotechnics because it is insensitive and relatively safe as such things go.

For photographic use, mixtures containing magnesium and nitrates are made much more fuel rich.  The excess magnesium is volatilized by the reaction and burns in air providing additional light.  In addition, the higher concentration of fuel results in a slower burn, providing more of a "poof" and less of a "bang" when ignited.  A formula from 1917 specifies 5 parts of magnesium to 6 parts of [[barium nitrate]] for a stoichiometry of nine parts fuel to one part oxidizer.&lt;ref&gt;Watkins, ''The Photographic Journal of America'', Vol. 54, 1917, Philadelphia, p. 384&lt;/ref&gt;  Modern recreations of photographic flash powders may avoid the use of barium salts because of their toxic nature.  A mixture of five parts 80 mesh magnesium to one part of potassium nitrate provides a good white flash without being too violent. Fuel rich flash powders are also used in theatrical [[flash pot]]s.

Magnesium based compositions degrade over long periods, as magnesium does not form a passivating oxide coating, meaning the metallic Mg will slowly react with atmospheric oxygen and moisture. As written above,Mg can be passivated. In military pyrotechnics involving magnesium fuels, external oxygen can be excluded by using hermetically sealed canisters.  Commercial photographic flash powders are sold as two-part mixtures, to be combined immediately before use.

=== Magnesium and PTFE ===
A flash composition designed specifically to generate flares that are exceptionally bright in the infrared portion of the spectrum use a mixture of pyro-grade magnesium and powdered [[polytetrafluoroethylene]].  These flares are used as decoys from aircraft that might be subject to heat-seeking missile fire.

:2n Mg + (C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;))&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; → 2n MgF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (s) + 2n C (s)

=== Antimony trisulfide and chlorate ===
This mixture, and similar mixtures sometimes containing pyro aluminium have been used since the early 1900s for small "Black Cat" style paper [[firecracker]]s. Its extremely low cost makes it popular among manufacturers of low-grade fireworks in China. Like all mixtures containing chlorates, it is extremely sensitive to friction, impact and ESD, and is considered unsafe in pyrotechnic devices that contain more than a few tens of milligrams of the mixture.

:18 KClO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 5 Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → 5 Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 15 SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 9 K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + 9 Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

This mixture is not highly energetic, and in at least some parts of the United States, [[firecracker]]s containing 50&amp;nbsp;mg or less of this mixture are legal as consumer fireworks.

==Safety and handling==
Flash powders even within intended usages often release explosive force of deadly capacity.  Nearly all widely used flash powder mixtures are sensitive to shock, friction and electrostatic discharge. In certain mixtures, it is not uncommon for this sensitivity to spontaneously change over time, or due to change in the environment, or to other unknowable factors in either the original manufacturing or in real-world storage. Additionally, accidental contaminants such as strong acids or sulfur compounds can sensitise them even more. Because flash powder mixtures are so easy to initiate, there is potentially a high risk of accidental explosions which can inflict severe blast/fragmentation injuries, e.g. blindness, explosive amputation, permanent maiming, or disfigurement. Fatalities have occurred. The various flash powder compositions should therefore not be handled by anyone who is unfamiliar with their properties, or the handling techniques required to maintain safety. Flash powder and flash powder devices pose exceptionally high risks to children, who typically cannot understand the danger and may be less adept with safe handling techniques. As a result, children tend to suffer more severe injuries than adults.

Flash powders&amp;mdash;especially those that use [[chlorate]]&amp;mdash;are often highly sensitive to friction, heat/flame and [[static electricity]]. A spark of as little as 0.1–10 millijoules can set off certain mixtures.  Certain formulations prominent in the [[underground press]] contain both [[sulfur]] and [[potassium chlorate]]. These mixtures are especially shock and friction sensitive and in many applications should be considered unpredictable.  Modern pyrotechnic practices call for never using sulfur in a mix containing chlorate salts.

Some flash powder formulations (those that use single-digit micrometre flake aluminium powder or fine magnesium powder as their fuel) can self-confine and explode in small quantities. This makes flash powder dangerous to handle, as it can cause severe hearing damage and amputation injury even when sitting in the open. Self-confinement occurs when the mass of the pile provides sufficient inertia to allow high pressure to build within it as the mixture reacts. This is referred to as 'inertial confinement', and it is not to be confused with a detonation.

Flash powder of any formulation should not be mixed in large quantities by amateur pyrotechnicians. Beginners should start with sub-gram quantities, and refrain from making large devices. Flash powder should only be made at the site at which it will be used. Additionally, the mixture should be made immediately before use.  When mixed, the transportation, storage, usage, various possession, and illegal "firearms" laws (including felonies) may come into effect that do not apply to the unmixed or pre-assembled components.

'''Galvanoluminescence''' Is the emission of light produced by the passage of an [[electric current]] through an appropriate [[electrolyte]] in which an [[electrode]], made of certain metals such as [[aluminium]] or [[tantalum]], has been immersed. An example being the [[electrolysis]] of [[sodium bromide]] (NaBr).

{{other|Hardstone (musician)}}
'''Hardstone''' is an unscientific term, mostly encountered in the [[decorative arts]] or [[archaeology]], that has a similar meaning to semi-precious stones, or [[gemstone]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cameo.mfa.org/materials/record.asp?key=2170&amp;subkey=4462&amp;MaterialName=Hardstone&amp;Description=&amp;Composition=&amp;CAS=&amp;MohsHardness=&amp;MeltingPoint=&amp;MolecularWeight=&amp;Density=&amp;RefrIndex=&amp;BoilingPoint=&amp;OtherProperties=&amp;Safety=&amp;Authority=&amp;Reference=&amp;ImageName=&amp;ImageCaption=&amp;Search=Search "Cameo" Glossary database], [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]]&lt;/ref&gt;   Very hard building stones, such as [[granite]], are not included in the term in this sense; only stones which are fairly hard, and regarded as attractive - in effect ones which could be used in [[jewellery]].  [[Hardstone carving]] is the three-dimensional carving for artistic purposes of [[semi-precious]] stones such as [[jade]], [[agate]], [[onyx]], [[rock crystal]], [[sard]] or [[carnelian]], and a general term for an object made in this way.  Two-dimensional [[inlay]] techniques for floors, furniture and walls include [[pietre dure]], [[opus sectile]] (Ancient Roman), and medieval [[Cosmatesque]] work - these typically inlay hardstone pieces into a background of [[marble]] or some other building stone. 

The definition of "hardstone" is not very rigid, but excludes "soft" stones such as [[soapstone]] (steatite) and [[minerals]] such as [[alabaster]], both widely used for carving. Hard organic minerals such as [[amber]] and [[Jet (lignite)|jet]] are included, as well as the [[mineraloid]] [[obsidian]].  [[Geology|Geologically]] speaking, most of the gemstones carved in the West are varieties of [[quartz]], including: [[chalcedony]], [[agate]], [[amethyst]], [[sard]], [[onyx]], [[carnelion]], [[Heliotrope (mineral)|heliotrope]], [[jasper]] and quartz in its uncoloured form, known as rock crystal.  On the [[Mohs scale of mineral hardness]], quartz rates no higher than a 7, less for types with impurities.  Stones typically used for buildings and large sculpture are not often used for small objects such as vessels, although this does occur.

The term is derived as a literal translation of the Italian plural [[pietre dure]]= "hard stones", which in Italian covers all hardstone carving.  The semi-anglicized singular [[pietra dura]] is used in English for multi-coloured stone [[inlay]] work, in fact using [[marble]]s as much as semi-precious stones, which was a [[Florence|Florentine]] speciality from the Renaissance onwards. "''Pietre dure''" is sometimes used (normally italicized) for Italian or European vessels and small sculptures of the same period.&lt;ref&gt;See the introduction to the web feature on [http://www.metmuseum.org/special/se_event.asp?OccurrenceId={B2022125-6C01-4B81-9DD3-5660A4F12D69} ''Art of the Royal Court: Treasures in Pietre Dure from the Palaces of Europe''] Exhibition at the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Heating degree day''' ('''HDD''') is a measurement designed to quantify the [[demand]] for [[energy]] needed to heat a building. HDD is derived from measurements of outside air [[temperature]]. The heating requirements for a given [[Architectural structure|building]] at a specific location are considered to be directly proportional to the number of HDD at that location. A similar measurement, cooling degree day (CDD), reflects the amount of energy used to cool a home or business.

==Definition==
Heating degree days are defined relative to a base temperature—the outside temperature above which a building needs no heating. Base temperatures may be defined for a particular building as a function of the  temperature that the building is heated to, or it may be defined for a country or region for example. In the latter case, building standards or conventions may exist for the temperature threshold. These include:

The base temperature does not necessarily correspond to the building mean internal temperature, as standards may consider mean building insulation levels and internal gains to determine an average external temperature at which heating will be required. Base temperatures of 16°C, 18°C, and 19°C (61, 65, 66 °F) are also used.&lt;ref name="satel-light"&gt;http://www.satel-light.com/runlib/soda/hddhelp.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The variation in choice of base temperature implies that HDD values cannot always be compared - care must be take to ensure that only HDDs with equal base temperatures are compared.

There are a number of ways in which HDD can be calculated: the more detailed a record of temperature data, the more accurate the HDD that can be calculated. HDD are often calculated using simple approximation methods that use daily temperature readings instead of more detailed temperature records such as half-hourly readings. One popular approximation method is to take the average temperature on any given day, and subtract it from the base temperature. If the value is less than or equal to zero, that day has zero HDD. But if the value is positive, that number represents the number of HDD on that day. This method works satisfactorily if the outside air temperature does not exceed the base temperature. In climates where this is likely to occur from time to time, there are refinements to the simple calculation which allow some 'credit' for the period of the day when the air is warm enough for heating to be unnecessary. This [http://www.vesma.com/ddd/ddcalcs.htm more accurate algorithm] enables results to be computed in temperate climates (maritime as well as continental) throughout the year (not just during a defined heating season) and on a weekly as well as monthly basis.

HDD can be added over periods of time to provide a rough estimate of seasonal heating requirements. In the course of a heating season, for example, the number of HDD for [[New York City]] is 5,050 whereas that for [[Barrow, Alaska]] is 19,990.  Thus, one can say that, for a given home of similar structure and insulation, around four times the energy would be required to heat the home in Barrow than in New York. Likewise, a similar home in [[Miami]], [[Florida]], whose heating degree days for the heating season is 500, would require around one tenth of the energy required to heat the house in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;Ristinen, Robert A., and Jack J. Kraushaar. Energy and the Environment. 2nd ed. Hoboken, NJ: John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, this is a theoretical approach as the level of [[Building insulation|insulation]] of a building affects the demand for heating. For example, temperatures often drop below the base temperature during night (daily low temperature in diurnal variation), but because of insulation, heating is unnecessary. In the end of spring and in the beginning of fall or in the winter depending on the climate, sufficient insulation keeps the indoor temperature higher than the outdoor temperature with little or no heating. For example in southern California, during winter heating is not necessary in Los Angeles and [[San Diego]] if the insulation is sufficient to take into account the colder night temperatures. Also, buildings include [[thermal mass]] such as concrete, that is able to store energy of the sun absorbed in daytime. Thus, even if the heating degree days indicate a demand for heating sufficient insulation of a building can make heating unnecessary.

== Example of use ==

HDD provides a simple metric for quantifying the amount of heating that buildings in a particular location need over a certain period (e.g. a particular month or year). In conjunction with the average U-value for a building they provide a means of roughly estimating the amount of energy required to heat the building over that period.

One HDD means that the temperature conditions outside the building were equivalent to being below a defined threshold comfort temperature inside the building by one degree for one day. Thus heat has to be provided inside the building to maintain thermal comfort.
 
Say we are given the number of heating degree days D in one year and we wish to calculate the energy required by a building. We know that heat needs to be provided at the rate at which it is being lost to the environment. This can be calculated as the sum of the heat losses per degree of each element of the buildings' thermal envelope (such as windows, walls, and roof) or as the average [[U-value]] of the building multiplied by the area of the thermal envelope of the building, or quoted directly for the whole building. This gives the buildings' specific heat loss rate P&lt;sub&gt;specific&lt;/sub&gt;, generally given in Watts per Kelvin (W/K). Total energy in kWh is then given by:

:&lt;math&gt;Q = P_{specific} \times 24 \times \frac{D}{1000} \;&lt;/math&gt; [kWh]

Note that as total energy consumption is in kWh and heating degree days are [no. days&amp;times;degrees] we must convert W/K into kWh per degree per day by dividing by 1000 (to convert W to kW), and multiplying by 24 hours in a day (1&amp;nbsp;kW = 1kWh per hour). Since a one degree Celsius temperature change and a one kelvin change in absolute temperature are the same, these cancel and no conversion is required.

Example: For a typical [[New York City]] winter day with high of 40 °F and low of 30 °F, the average temperature is likely to be around 35 °F. For such a day we can approximate the HDD as (65 - 35) = 30. A month of thirty similar days might accumulate 900 HDD. A year (including summer average temperatures above 70 °F) might accumulate an annual 5000 HDD.

== Problems ==

Calculations using HDD have several problems. Heat requirements are not linear with temperature,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Valor |first=E. |author2=Meneu, V. |author3=Caselles, V.  |title=Daily Air Temperature and Electricity Load in Spain |journal=Journal of Applied Meteorology |volume=40 |issue=8 |pages=1413–1421 |year=2001 |doi=10.1175/1520-0450(2001)040&lt;1413:DATAEL&gt;2.0.CO;2 |bibcode = 2001JApMe..40.1413V }}&lt;/ref&gt; and heavily insulated buildings have a lower [[Balance point temperature|"balance point"]]. The amount of heating and cooling required depends on several factors besides outdoor temperature: How well insulated a particular building is, the amount of [[solar radiation]] reaching the interior of a house, the number of [[electrical appliance]]s running (e.g. computers raise their surrounding temperature) the amount of [[wind]] outside, and what temperature the occupants find comfortable. Another important factor is the amount of [[relative humidity]] indoors; this is important in determining how comfortable an individual will be. Other variables such as precipitation, cloud cover, heat index, building albedo, and snow cover can also alter a building's thermal response.

Another problem with HDD is that care needs to be taken if they are to be used to compare climates internationally, because of the different baseline temperatures used as standard in different countries and the use of the Fahrenheit scale in the US and the Celsius scale almost everywhere else. This is further compounded by the use of different approximation methods in different countries.

== Conversion ==
To convert °F HDD to °C HDD:

: &lt;math&gt;^{\circ}C\, \mathit{HDD} = \frac{5}{9} \times \, ^{\circ}F\, \mathit{HDD}&lt;/math&gt;

To convert °C HDD to °F HDD:

: &lt;math&gt;^{\circ}F\, \mathit{HDD} = \frac{9}{5} \times \, ^{\circ}C\, \mathit{HDD}&lt;/math&gt;

Note that, because HDD are relative to a base temperature (as opposed to being relative to zero), it is incorrect to add or subtract 32 when converting degree days from Celsius to Fahrenheit or vice versa.

In [[aviation]], '''icing conditions''' are those [[Atmospheric icing|atmospheric conditions that can lead to the formation of water ice on the surfaces]] of an aircraft, or within the engine as [[carburetor icing]]. [[Inlet icing]] is another engine-related danger, often occurring in [[jet aircraft]]. These icing phenomena do not necessarily occur together. Many aircraft, especially general aviation aircraft, are not certified for flight into ''known icing''—icing conditions certain or likely to exist, based on [[pilot report]]s, [[METAR|observations]], and [[Terminal Aerodrome Forecast|forecasts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.aopa.org/members/files/pilot/2005/pc0508.html |title=The law on 'known icing' |last=Yodice |first=John S. |publisher=AOPA Pilot Magazine |date=August 2005 |volume=48 |issue=8 |accessdate=2013-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==

Icing conditions exist when the air contains droplets of supercooled liquid water; icing conditions are characterized quantitatively by the average droplet size, the liquid water content and the air temperature. These parameters affect the extent and speed that characterize the formation of ice on an aircraft. [[Federal Aviation Regulations]] contain a definition of icing conditions&lt;ref&gt;[http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr&amp;sid=5f0d7e508cbd492d43ba2418fb8dc14e&amp;rgn=div9&amp;view=text&amp;node=14:1.0.1.3.11.8.201.18.18&amp;idno=14 Federal Aviation Regulations, Part 25, Appendix C]&lt;/ref&gt; that some aircraft are certified to fly into. So-called SLD, or supercooled large droplet, conditions are those that exceed that specification and represent a particular hazard to aircraft.

Qualitatively, [[pilot report]]s indicate icing conditions in terms of their effect upon the aircraft, and will be dependent upon the capabilities of the aircraft. Different aircraft may report the same quantitative conditions as different levels of icing as a result.

==Types of structural ice==
[[File:Icing on a rotor.jpg|right|300px|thumb|Ice protrusions on the rotor blade]]
*'''Clear ice''' is often clear and smooth. Supercooled water droplets, or [[freezing rain]], strike a surface but do not freeze instantly.  Often "horns" or protrusions are formed and project into the airflow.
*'''Rime ice''' is rough and opaque, formed by supercooled drops rapidly freezing on impact. Forming mostly along an [[airfoil]]'s [[stagnation point]], it generally conforms to the shape of the airfoil.
*'''Mixed ice''' is a combination of clear and rime ice.
*'''Frost ice''' is the result of water freezing on unprotected surfaces while the aircraft is stationary.  This can be dangerous when flight is attempted because it disrupts an airfoil's boundary layer airflow causing a premature aerodynamic stall and, in some cases, dramatically increased drag making takeoff dangerous or impossible.
*'''SLD ice''' refers to ice formed in Supercooled Large Droplet (SLD) conditions. It is similar to clear ice, but because droplet size is large, it extends to unprotected parts of the aircraft and forms larger ice shapes, faster than normal icing conditions. This was a factor in the crash of [[American Eagle Flight 4184]].
[[File:Icing on a plane.jpg|left|300px|thumb|SLD ice on a plane]]

==Effect==

The wing will ordinarily stall at a lower angle of attack, and thus a higher airspeed, when contaminated with ice. Even small amounts of ice will have an effect, and if the ice is rough, it can be a large effect. Thus an increase in approach speed is advisable if ice remains on the wings. How much of an increase depends on both the aircraft type and amount of ice. Stall characteristics of an aircraft with ice contaminated wings will be degraded, and serious roll control problems are not unusual. The ice accretion may be asymmetric between the two wings. Also, the outer part of a wing, which is ordinarily thinner and thus a better collector of ice, may stall first rather than last.

==Icing prevention and removal==

Several methods exist to reduce the dangers of icing. The first, and simplest, is to avoid icing conditions altogether, but for many flights this is not practical.

If ice (or other contaminants) are present on an aircraft prior to takeoff, they must be removed from critical surfaces. Removal can take many forms:
* Mechanical means, which may be as simple as using a broom or brush to remove snow
* Application of [[deicing fluid]] or even hot water to remove ice, snow, etc.
* Use of infrared heating to melt and remove contaminants
* Put the aircraft into a heated hangar until snow and ice have melted
* Position aircraft towards the sun to maximize heating up of snow and ice covered surfaces.  In practice this method is limited to thin contamination, by the time and weather conditions.
All of these methods remove existing contamination, but provide no practical protection in icing conditions. If icing conditions exist, or are expected before takeoff, then anti-icing fluids are used. These are thicker than deicing fluids and resist the effects of snow and rain for some time. They are intended to shear off the aircraft during takeoff and provide no inflight protection.

[[Image:Horizon Air Q400 deicing boot.JPG|right|300px|thumb|Wing of a [[Bombardier Aerospace|Bombardier]] [[Bombardier Dash 8|Dash 8 Q400]] passenger aircraft.  The black rubber [[deicing boot]] is inflated with air, producing ridges to crack and dislodge any accumulated ice.]]

To protect an aircraft against icing in-flight, various forms of anti-icing or deicing are used:
* A common approach is to route engine "bleed air" into ducting along the leading edges of wings and tailplanes. The air heats the leading edge of the surface and this melts or evaporates ice on contact.  On a turbine powered aircraft air is extracted from the compressor section of the engine. If the aircraft is turbocharged piston powered, bleed air can be scavenged from the turbocharger.
* Some aircraft are equipped with pneumatic [[deicing boot]]s that disperse ice build-up on the surface. These systems require less engine bleed air but are usually less effective than a heated surface.
* A few aircraft use a [[weeping wing]] system, which has hundreds of small holes in the leading edges and releases anti-icing fluid on demand to prevent the buildup of ice.
* Electrical heating is also used to protect aircraft and components (including propellers) against icing. The heating may be applied continuously (usually on small, critical, components, such as [[pitot static]] sensors and angle of attack vanes) or intermittently, giving an effect similar to the use of [[deicing boot]]s.
In all these cases usually only critical aircraft surfaces and components are protected. In particular only the leading edge of a wing is usually protected.

[[Carburetor heat]] is applied to carbureted engines to prevent and clear icing. [[fuel injection|Fuel-injected engine]]s are not susceptible to carburetor icing but can suffer from blocked inlets. In these engines an alternate air source is often available.

Note there is a difference between deicing and anti-icing. Deicing refers to the removal of ice from the airframe; anti-icing refers to the prevention of ice accumulating on the airframe.

'''Iodine''' is a [[chemical element]] with symbol '''I''' and [[atomic number]] 53. The heaviest of the stable [[halogen]]s, it exists as a lustrous, purple-black non-metallic solid at [[standard condition]]s that [[Sublimation (phase transition)|sublimes]] readily to form a violet gas.  The elemental form was discovered by the French chemist [[Bernard Courtois]] in 1811. It was named two years later by [[Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac]] from this property, after the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''ἰώδης'' "violet-coloured".

Iodine occurs in many oxidation states, including [[iodide]] (I&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;), [[iodate]] ({{chem|IO|3|-}}), and the various [[periodate]] anions. It is the least abundant of the stable halogens, being the sixty-first most abundant element.  It is even less abundant than the so-called [[rare earth elements|rare earths]]. It is the heaviest essential [[mineral nutrient]]. Iodine is essential in the synthesis of [[thyroid hormone]]s.&lt;ref name="lpi"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/mic/minerals/iodine|title=Iodine|publisher=Micronutrient Information Center, Linus Pauling Institute, Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR|date=2015|accessdate=20 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Iodine deficiency]] affects about two billion people and is the leading preventable cause of [[intellectual disabilities]].

The dominant producers of iodine today are [[Chile]] and [[Japan]]. Iodine and its [[chemical compound|compounds]] are primarily used in [[nutrition]]. Due to its high atomic number and ease of attachment to [[organic compound]]s, it has also found favour as a non-toxic [[radiocontrast]] material. Because of the specificity of its uptake by the human body, radioactive isotopes of iodine can also be used to treat [[thyroid cancer]]. Iodine is also used as a [[catalyst]] in the industrial production of [[acetic acid]] and some [[polymer]]s.

==History==
In 1811, iodine was discovered by French chemist [[Bernard Courtois]],&lt;ref name=court&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Courtois |first=Bernard |title=Découverte d'une substance nouvelle dans le Vareck |journal=[[Annales de chimie]] |volume=88 |page=304|date=1813 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YGwri-w7sMAC&amp;pg=RA2-PA304}} In French, seaweed that had been washed onto the shore was called "varec", "varech", or "vareck", whence the English word "wrack". Later, "varec" also referred to the ashes of such seaweed: The ashes were used as a source of iodine and salts of sodium and potassium.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Swain |first=Patricia A. |title=Bernard Courtois (1777–1838) famed for discovering iodine (1811), and his life in Paris from 1798 |journal=Bulletin for the History of Chemistry |volume=30 |issue=2 |page=103 |date=2005 |url=http://www.scs.uiuc.edu/~mainzv/HIST/awards/OPA%20Papers/2007-Swain.pdf |access-date=2 April 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100714110757/http://www.scs.uiuc.edu/~mainzv/HIST/awards/OPA%20Papers/2007-Swain.pdf |archive-date=14 July 2010 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; who was born to a manufacturer of [[potassium nitrate|saltpeter]] (an essential component of [[gunpowder]]). At the time of the [[Napoleonic Wars]], saltpeter was in great demand in [[France]]. Saltpeter produced from French [[nitrary|nitre beds]] required [[sodium carbonate]], which could be isolated from [[seaweed]] collected on the coasts of [[Normandy]] and [[Brittany]]. To isolate the sodium carbonate, seaweed was burned and the ash washed with water. The remaining waste was destroyed by adding [[sulfuric acid]]. Courtois once added excessive sulfuric acid and a cloud of purple vapour rose. He noted that the vapour crystallised on cold surfaces, making dark crystals.&lt;ref name=Greenwood794&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, p. 794&lt;/ref&gt; Courtois suspected that this material was a new element but lacked funding to pursue it further.&lt;ref name=vdK&gt;{{cite web|url=http://elements.vanderkrogt.net/element.php?sym=i |title=53 Iodine  |publisher=Elements.vanderkrogt.net |accessdate=23 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Courtois gave samples to his friends, [[Charles Bernard Desormes]] (1777–1838) and [[Nicolas Clément]] (1779–1841), to continue research. He also gave some of the substance to [[chemist]] [[Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac]] (1778–1850), and to [[physicist]] [[André-Marie Ampère]] (1775–1836). On 29 November 1813, Desormes and Clément made Courtois' discovery public. They described the substance to a meeting of the Imperial [[Institute of France]].&lt;ref&gt;Desormes and Clément made their announcement at the Institut impérial de France on 29 November 1813; a summary of their announcement appeared in the ''Gazette nationale ou Le Moniteur Universel'' of 2 December 1813.

==Properties==
[[File:IodoAtomico.JPG|thumb|left|upright=0.7|alt=Round bottom flask filled with violet iodine vapour|Violet iodine vapour in a round-bottomed flask]]
Iodine is the fourth [[halogen]], being a member of group 17 in the periodic table, below [[fluorine]], [[chlorine]], and [[bromine]]; it is the heaviest stable member of its group. (The scarce and fugitive fifth halogen, the radioactive [[astatine]], is not well-studied due to its expense and inaccessibility in large quantities, but appears to show various unusual properties due to [[relativistic effects]].) Iodine has an electron configuration of [Kr]4d&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;5s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;5p&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;, with the seven electrons in the fifth and outermost shell being its [[valence electron]]s. Like the other halogens, it is one electron short of a full octet and is hence a strong oxidising agent, reacting with many elements in order to complete its outer shell, although in keeping with [[periodic trend]]s, it is the weakest oxidising agent among the stable halogens: it has the lowest [[electronegativity]] among them, just 2.66 on the Pauling scale (compare fluorine, chlorine, and bromine at 3.98, 3.16, and 2.96 respectively; astatine continues the trend with an electronegativity of 2.2). Elemental iodine hence forms [[diatomic molecule]]s with chemical formula I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, where two iodine atoms share a pair of electrons in order to each achieve a stable octet for themselves; at high temperatures, these diatomic molecules reversibly dissociate a pair of iodine atoms. Similarly, the iodide anion, I&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;, is the strongest reducing agent among the stable halogens, being the most easily oxidised back to diatomic I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name=Greenwood800&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 800–4&lt;/ref&gt; (Astatine goes further, being indeed unstable as At&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; and readily oxidised to At&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; or At&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, although the existence of At&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is not settled.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | series = Gmelin Handbook of Inorganic and Organometallic Chemistry | title = 'At, Astatine', System No. 8a | edition=8th | year = 1985 | publisher = Springer-Verlag | isbn = 3-540-93516-9 | last1 = Kugler | first1 = H. K. | last2 = Keller | first2 = C. | volume = 8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The halogens darken in colour as the group is descended: fluorine is a very pale yellow gas, chlorine is greenish-yellow, and bromine is a reddish-brown volatile liquid. Iodine conforms to the prevailing trend, being a shiny black crystalline solid that melts at 114&amp;nbsp;°C and boils at 183&amp;nbsp;°C to form a violet gas. This trend occurs because the wavelengths of visible light absorbed by the halogens increase down the group (though astatine may not conform to it, depending on how metallic it turns out to be).&lt;ref name=Greenwood800/&gt; Specifically, the violet colour of iodine gas results from the [[atomic electron transition|electron transition]] between the [[HOMO/LUMO|highest occupied]] antibonding ''π&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;'' molecular orbital and the lowest vacant antibonding ''σ&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;'' molecular orbital.&lt;ref name=Greenwood804&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 804–9&lt;/ref&gt;

Elemental iodine is slightly soluble in water, with one gram dissolving in 3450&amp;nbsp;ml at 20&amp;nbsp;°C and 1280&amp;nbsp;ml at 50&amp;nbsp;°C; [[potassium iodide]] may be added to increase solubility via formation of [[triiodide]] ions, among other polyiodides.&lt;ref name=Greenwood804/&gt; Nonpolar solvents such as [[hexane]] and [[carbon tetrachloride]] provide a higher solubility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = Merck Index of Chemicals and Drugs| edition = 9th| date = 1976| isbn=0-911910-26-3| editor = Windholz, Martha| editor2 = Budavari, Susan| editor3 = Stroumtsos, Lorraine Y.| editor4 = Fertig, Margaret Noether| publisher = J A Majors Company}}&lt;/ref&gt; Polar solutions, such as aqueous solutions, are brown, reflecting the role of these solvents as [[Lewis base]]s; on the other hand, nonpolar solutions are violet, the color of iodine vapour.&lt;ref name=Greenwood804/&gt; [[Charge-transfer complex]]es form when iodine is dissolved in polar solvents, hence changing the colour. Iodine is violet when dissolved in carbon tetrachloride and saturated hydrocarbons but deep brown in [[alcohol]]s and [[amine]]s, solvents that form charge-transfer adducts.&lt;ref name=King&gt;{{cite book |last=King |first=R.

The melting and boiling points of iodine are the highest among the halogens, conforming to the increasing trend down the group, since iodine has the largest electron cloud among them that is the most easily polarised, resulting in its molecules having the strongest [[van der Waals interaction]]s among the halogens. Similarly, iodine is the least volatile of the halogens.&lt;ref name=Greenwood800/&gt; Because it has the largest [[atomic radius]] among the halogens, iodine has the lowest first [[ionisation energy]], lowest [[electron affinity]], lowest [[electronegativity]] and lowest reactivity of the halogens.&lt;ref name=Greenwood800/&gt;

[[File:Iodine-unit-cell-3D-balls-B.png|thumb|upright=0.7|right|Structure of solid iodine]]
The interhalogen bond in diiodine is the weakest of all the halogens. As such, 1% of a sample of gaseous iodine at atmospheric pressure is dissociated into iodine atoms at 575&amp;nbsp;°C. Temperatures greater than 750&amp;nbsp;°C are required for fluorine, chlorine, and bromine to dissociate to a similar extent. Most bonds to iodine are weaker than the analogous bonds to the lighter halogens.&lt;ref name=Greenwood800/&gt; Gaseous iodine is composed of I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecules with an I–I bond length of 266.6&amp;nbsp;pm. The I–I bond is one of the longest single bonds known.  It is even longer (271.5&amp;nbsp;pm) in solid [[orthorhombic]] crystalline iodine, which has the same crystal structure as chlorine and bromine. (The record is held by iodine's neighbour [[xenon]]: the Xe–Xe bond length is 308.71&amp;nbsp;pm.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = Advanced Structural Inorganic Chemistry| first1 = Wai-Kee| last1 = Li| first2 = Gong-Du| last2 = Zhou| first3 = Thomas C.

===Isotopes===
{{main|Isotopes of iodine}}
Of the thirty-seven known [[isotopes of iodine]], only one occurs in nature, iodine-127.  The others are radioactive and have half-lives too short to be [[primordial nuclide|primordial]]. As such, iodine is [[monoisotopic element|monoisotopic]] and its atomic weight is known to great precision, as it is a constant of nature.&lt;ref name=Greenwood800/&gt;

Though it is the least reactive of the halogens, iodine is still one of the more reactive elements. For example, while chlorine gas will halogenate [[carbon monoxide]], [[nitric oxide]], and [[sulfur dioxide]] (to [[phosgene]], [[nitrosyl chloride]], and [[sulfuryl chloride]] respectively), iodine will not do so. Furthermore, iodination of metals tends to result in lower oxidation states than chlorination or bromination; for example, [[rhenium]] metal reacts with chlorine to form [[rhenium hexachloride]], but with bromine it forms only [[rhenium pentabromide]] and iodine can achieve only [[rhenium tetraiodide]].&lt;ref name=Greenwood800/&gt; By the same token, however, since iodine has the lowest ionisation energy among the halogens and is the most easily oxidised of them, it has a more significant cationic chemistry and its higher oxidation states are rather more stable than those of bromine and chlorine, for example in [[iodine heptafluoride]].&lt;ref name=Greenwood804/&gt;

===Hydrogen iodide===
The simplest compound of iodine is [[hydrogen iodide]], HI. It is a colourless gas that reacts with oxygen to give water and iodine. Although it is useful in [[iodination]] reactions in the laboratory, it does not have large-scale industrial uses, unlike the other hydrogen halides. Commercially, it is usually made by reacting iodine with [[hydrogen sulfide]] or [[hydrazine]]:&lt;ref name=Greenwood809&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 809–12&lt;/ref&gt;
:2 I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; {{overset|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O|⟶}} 4 HI + N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
At room temperature, it is a colourless gas, like all of the hydrogen halides except [[hydrogen fluoride]], since hydrogen cannot form strong [[hydrogen bond]]s to the large and only mildly electronegative iodine atom. It melts at −51.0&amp;nbsp;°C and boils at −35.1&amp;nbsp;°C. It is an [[endothermic]] compound that can exothermically dissociate at room temperature, although the process is very slow unless a [[catalyst]] is present: the reaction between hydrogen and iodine at room temperature to give hydrogen iodide does not proceed to completion. The H–I [[bond dissociation energy]] is likewise the smallest of the hydrogen halides, at 295&amp;nbsp;kJ/mol.&lt;ref name=Greenwood812&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 812–9&lt;/ref&gt;

Aqueous hydrogen iodide is known as [[hydroiodic acid]], which is a strong acid. Hydrogen iodide is exceptionally soluble in water: one litre of water will dissolve 425 litres of hydrogen iodide, and the saturated solution has only four water molecules per molecule of hydrogen iodide.&lt;ref&gt;Holleman, A. F.; Wiberg, E. "Inorganic Chemistry" Academic Press: San Diego, 2001. {{ISBN|0-12-352651-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Commercial so-called "concentrated" hydroiodic acid usually contains 48–57% HI by mass; the solution forms an [[azeotrope]] with boiling point 126.7&amp;nbsp;°C at 56.7&amp;nbsp;g HI per 100&amp;nbsp;g solution. Hence hydroiodic acid cannot be concentrated past this point by evaporation of water.&lt;ref name=Greenwood812/&gt;

Unlike [[hydrogen fluoride]], anhydrous liquid hydrogen iodide is difficult to work with as a solvent, because its boiling point is low, it has a small liquid range, its [[dielectric constant]] is low and it does not dissociate appreciably into H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;I&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and {{chem|HI|2|-}} ions – the latter, in any case, are much less stable than the [[bifluoride]] ions ({{chem|HF|2|-}}) due to the very weak hydrogen bonding between hydrogen and iodine, though its salts with very large and weakly polarising cations such as [[caesium|Cs&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]] and [[quaternary ammonium cation|{{chem|NR|4|+}}]] (R = [[methyl group|Me]], [[ethyl group|Et]], [[butyl group|Bu&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;]]) may still be isolated. Anhydrous hydrogen iodide is a poor solvent, able to dissolve only small molecular compounds such as nitrosyl chloride and [[phenol]], or salts with very low [[lattice energy|lattice energies]] such as tetraalkylammonium halides.&lt;ref name=Greenwood812/&gt;

===Other binary iodides===
Nearly all elements in the periodic table form binary iodides. The exceptions are decidedly in the minority and stem in each case from one of three causes: extreme inertness and reluctance to participate in chemical reactions (the [[noble gas]]es); extreme nuclear instability hampering chemical investigation before decay and transmutation (many of the heaviest elements beyond [[bismuth]]); and having an electronegativity higher than iodine's ([[oxygen]], [[nitrogen]], and the first three halogens), so that the resultant binary compounds are formally not iodides but rather oxides, nitrides, or halides of iodine. (Nonetheless, [[nitrogen triiodide]] is named as an iodide as it is analogous to the other nitrogen trihalides.)&lt;ref name=Greenwood821/&gt;

Given the large size of the iodide anion and iodine's weak oxidising power, high oxidation states are difficult to achieve in binary iodides, the maximum known being in the pentaiodides of [[niobium]], [[tantalum]], and [[protactinium]]. Iodides can be made by reaction of an element or its oxide, hydroxide, or carbonate with hydroiodic acid, and then dehydrated by mildly high temperatures combined with either low pressure or anhydrous hydrogen iodide gas. These methods work best when the iodide product is stable to hydrolysis; otherwise, the possibilities include high-temperature oxidative iodination of the element with iodine or hydrogen iodide, high-temperature iodination of a metal oxide or other halide by iodine, a volatile metal halide, [[carbon tetraiodide]], or an organic iodide. For example, [[molybdenum(IV) oxide]] reacts with [[aluminium(III) iodide]] at 230&amp;nbsp;°C to give [[molybdenum(II) iodide]]. An example involving halogen exchange is given below, involving the reaction of [[tantalum(V) chloride]] with excess aluminium(III) iodide at 400&amp;nbsp;°C to give [[tantalum(V) iodide]]:&lt;ref name=Greenwood821&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 821–4&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;chem&gt;3TaCl5 + \underset{(excess)}{5AlI3} -&gt; 3TaI5 + 5AlCl3&lt;/chem&gt;

Lower iodides may be produced either through thermal decomposition or disproportionation, or by reducing the higher iodide with hydrogen or a metal, for example:&lt;ref name=Greenwood821/&gt;

: &lt;chem&gt;TaI5{} + Ta -&gt;[\text{thermal gradient}] [\ce{630^\circ C\ -&gt;\ 575^\circ C}] Ta6I14&lt;/chem&gt;

Most of the iodides of the pre-transition metals (groups 1, 2, and 3, along with the [[lanthanide]]s and [[actinide]]s in the +2 and +3 oxidation states) are mostly ionic, while nonmetals tend to form covalent molecular iodides, as do metals in high oxidation states from +3 and above. Ionic iodides MI&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; tend to have the lowest melting and boiling points among the halides MX&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; of the same element, because the electrostatic forces of attraction between the cations and anions are weakest for the large iodide anion. In contrast, covalent iodides tend to instead have the highest melting and boiling points among the halides of the same element, since iodine is the most polarisable of the halogens and, having the most electrons among them, can contribute the most to van der Waals forces. Naturally, exceptions abound in intermediate iodides where one trend gives way to the other. Similarly, solubilities in water of predominantly ionic iodides (e.g. [[potassium]] and [[calcium]]) are the greatest among ionic halides of that element, while those of covalent iodides (e.g. [[silver]]) are the lowest of that element. In particular, [[silver iodide]] is very insoluble in water and its formation is often used as a qualitative test for iodine.&lt;ref name=Greenwood821/&gt;

===Iodine halides===
The halogens form many binary, [[diamagnetic]] [[interhalogen]] compounds with stoichiometries XY, XY&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, XY&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;, and XY&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; (where X is heavier than Y), and iodine is no exception. Iodine forms all three possible diatomic interhalogens, a trifluoride and trichloride, as well as a pentafluoride and, exceptionally among the halogens, a heptafluoride. Numerous cationic and anionic derivatives are also characterised, such as the wine-red or bright orange compounds of {{chem|ICl|2|+}} and the dark brown or purplish black compounds of I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. Apart from these, some [[pseudohalogen|pseudohalides]] are also known, such as [[cyanogen iodide]] (ICN), iodine [[thiocyanate]] (ISCN), and iodine [[azide]] (IN&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref name=Greenwood824&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 824–8&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Iodine monochloride1.jpg|thumb|right|Iodine monochloride]]
[[Iodine monofluoride]] (IF) is unstable at room temperature and disproportionates very readily and irreversibly to iodine and [[iodine pentafluoride]], and thus cannot be obtained pure. It can be synthesised from the reaction of iodine with fluorine gas in [[trichlorofluoromethane]] at −45&amp;nbsp;°C, with [[iodine trifluoride]] in trichlorofluoromethane at −78&amp;nbsp;°C, or with [[silver(I) fluoride]] at 0&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name=Greenwood824/&gt; [[Iodine monochloride]] (ICl) and [[iodine monobromide]] (IBr), on the other hand, are moderately stable. The former, a volatile red-brown compound, was discovered independently by [[Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac]] and [[Humphry Davy]] in 1813–4 not long after the discoveries of chlorine and iodine, and it mimics the intermediate halogen bromine so well that [[Justus von Liebig]] was misled into mistaking bromine (which he had found) for iodine monochloride. Iodine monochloride and iodine monobromide may be prepared simply by reacting iodine with chlorine or bromine at room temperature and purified by [[fractional crystallization (chemistry)|fractional crystallisation]]. Both are quite reactive and attack even [[platinum]] and [[gold]], though not [[boron]], [[carbon]], [[cadmium]], [[lead]], [[zirconium]], [[niobium]], [[molybdenum]], and [[tungsten]]. Their reaction with organic compounds depends on conditions. Iodine chloride vapour tends to chlorinate [[phenol]] and [[salicyclic acid]], since when iodine chloride undergoes homolytic dissociation, chlorine and iodine are produced and the former is more reactive. However, iodine chloride in tetrachloromethane solution results in iodination being the main reaction, since now heterolytic fission of the I–Cl bond occurs and I&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; attacks phenol as an electrophile. However, iodine monobromide tends to brominate phenol even in tetrachloromethane solution because it tends to dissociate into its elements in solution, and bromine is more reactive than iodine.&lt;ref name=Greenwood824/&gt; When liquid, iodine monochloride and iodine monobromide dissociate into {{chem|I|2|X|+}} and {{chem|IX|2|-}} anions (X = Cl, Br); thus they are significant conductors of electricity and can be used as ionising solvents.&lt;ref name=Greenwood824/&gt;

[[Iodine trifluoride]] (IF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) is an unstable yellow solid that decomposes above −28&amp;nbsp;°C. It is thus little-known. It is difficult to produce because fluorine gas would tend to oxidise iodine all the way to the pentafluoride; reaction at low temperature with [[xenon difluoride]] is necessary. [[Iodine trichloride]], which exists in the solid state as the planar dimer I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, is a bright yellow solid, synthesised by reacting iodine with liquid chlorine at −80&amp;nbsp;°C; caution is necessary during purification because it easily dissociates to iodine monochloride and chlorine and hence can act as a strong chlorinating agent. Liquid iodine trichloride conducts electricity, possibly indicating dissociation to {{chem|ICl|2|+}} and {{chem|ICl|4|-}} ions.&lt;ref name=Greenwood828&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 828–31&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Iodine pentafluoride]] (IF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;), a colourless, volatile liquid, is the most thermodynamically stable iodine fluoride, and can be made by reacting iodine with fluorine gas at room temperature. It is a fluorinating agent, but is mild enough to store in glass apparatus. Again, slight electrical conductivity is present in the liquid state because of dissociation to {{chem|IF|4|+}} and {{chem|IF|6|-}}. The [[pentagonal bipyramidal molecular geometry|pentagonal bipyramidal]] [[iodine heptafluoride]] (IF&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;) is an extremely powerful fluorinating agent, behind only [[chlorine trifluoride]], [[chlorine pentafluoride]], and [[bromine pentafluoride]] among the interhalogens: it reacts with almost all the elements even at low temperatures, fluorinates [[Pyrex]] glass to form iodine(VII) oxyfluoride (IOF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;), and sets carbon monoxide on fire.&lt;ref name=Greenwood832&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 832–5&lt;/ref&gt;

===Iodine oxides and oxoacids===
[[File:Iodine-pentoxide-3D-balls.png|thumb|right|upright=0.7|Structure of iodine pentoxide]]
[[Iodine oxide]]s are the most stable of all the halogen oxides, because of the strong I–O bonds resulting from the large electronegativity difference between iodine and oxygen, and they have been known for the longest time.&lt;ref name=King/&gt; The stable, white, [[hygroscopic]] [[iodine pentoxide]] (I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;) has been known since its formation in 1813 by Gay-Lussac and Davy. It is most easily made by the dehydration of [[iodic acid]] (HIO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), of which it is the anhydride. It will quickly oxidise carbon monoxide completely to [[carbon dioxide]] at room temperature, and is thus a useful reagent in determining carbon monoxide concentration. It also oxidises nitrogen oxide, [[ethylene]], and [[hydrogen sulfide]]. It reacts with [[sulfur trioxide]] and [[peroxydisulfuryl difluoride]] (S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) to form salts of the iodyl cation, [IO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, and is reduced by concentrated [[sulfuric acid]]s to iodosyl salts involving [IO]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. It may be fluorinated by fluorine, bromine trifluoride, [[sulfur tetrafluoride]], or [[chloryl fluoride]], resulting iodine pentafluoride, which also reacts with iodine pentoxide, giving iodine(V) oxyfluoride, IOF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. A few other less stable oxides are known, notably I&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt; and I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;; their structures have not been determined, but reasonable guesses are I&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;(I&lt;sup&gt;V&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and [IO]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;[IO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; respectively.&lt;ref name=Greenwood851&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 851–3&lt;/ref&gt;

More important are the four oxoacids: [[hypoiodous acid]] (HIO), [[iodous acid]] (HIO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), [[iodic acid]] (HIO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), and [[periodic acid]] (HIO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; or H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;IO&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;). When iodine dissolves in aqueous solution, the following reactions occur:&lt;ref name=Greenwood853&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 853–9&lt;/ref&gt;

|}

Hypoiodous acid is unstable to disproportionation. The hypoiodite ions thus formed disproportionate immediately to give iodide and iodate:&lt;ref name=Greenwood853/&gt;

|}

Iodous acid and iodite are even less stable and exist only as a fleeting intermediate in the oxidation of iodide to iodate, if at all.&lt;ref name=Greenwood853/&gt; Iodates are by far the most important of these compounds, which can be made by oxidising [[alkali metal]] iodides with oxygen at 600&amp;nbsp;°C and high pressure, or by oxidising iodine with [[chlorate]]s. Unlike chlorates, which disproportionate very slowly to form chloride and perchlorate, iodates are stable to disproportionation in both acidic and alkaline solutions. From these, salts of most metals can be obtained. Iodic acid is most easily made by oxidation of an aqueous iodine suspension by [[electrolysis]] or fuming [[nitric acid]]. Iodate has the weakest oxidising power of the halates, but reacts the quickest.&lt;ref name=Greenwood863&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 863–4&lt;/ref&gt;

Many periodates are known, including not only the expected tetrahedral {{chem|IO|4|-}}, but also square-pyramidal {{chem|IO|5|3-}}, octahedral orthoperiodate {{chem|IO|6|5-}}, [IO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;, [I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;(OH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)]&lt;sup&gt;4−&lt;/sup&gt;, and {{chem|I|2|O|9|4-}}. They are usually made by oxidising alkaline [[sodium iodate]] electrochemically (with [[lead(IV) oxide]] as the anode) or by chlorine gas:&lt;ref name=Greenwood872&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 872–5&lt;/ref&gt;
:{{chem|IO|3|-}} + 6 OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; → {{chem|IO|6|5-}} + 3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + 2 e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;
:{{chem|IO|3|-}} + 6 OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; + Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → {{chem|IO|6|5-}} + 2 Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; + 3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

They are thermodymically and kinetically powerful oxidising agents, quickly oxidising Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; to [[permanganate|{{chem|MnO|4|-}}]], and cleaving [[glycol]]s, α-[[diketone]]s, α-[[ketol]]s, α-[[aminoalcohols]], and α-[[diamine]]s.&lt;ref name=Greenwood872/&gt; Orthoperiodate especially stabilises high oxidation states among metals because of its very high negative charge of −5. [[Orthoperiodic acid]], H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;IO&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, is stable, and dehydrates at 100&amp;nbsp;°C in a vacuum to [[metaperiodic acid]], HIO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. Attempting to go further does not result in the nonexistent iodine heptoxide (I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;), but rather iodine pentoxide and oxygen. Periodic acid may be protonated by [[sulfuric acid]] to give the {{chem|I(OH)|6|+}} cation, isoelectronic to Te(OH)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; and {{chem|Sb(OH)|6|-}}, and giving salts with bisulfate and sulfate.&lt;ref name=King/&gt;

===Polyiodine compounds===
When iodine dissolves in strong acids, such as fuming sulfuric acid, a bright blue [[paramagnetic]] solution including {{chem|I|2|+}} cations is formed. A solid salt of the diiodine cation may be obtained by oxidising iodine with [[antimony pentafluoride]]:&lt;ref name=King/&gt;
:2 I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 5 SbF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; {{overunderset|{{big|⟶}}|SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;|20°C}} 2 I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt; + SbF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
The salt I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt; is dark blue, and the blue [[tantalum]] analogue I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ta&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt; is also known. Whereas the I–I bond length in I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is 267&amp;nbsp;pm, that in {{chem|I|2|+}} is only 256&amp;nbsp;pm as the missing electron in the latter has been removed from an antibonding orbital, making the bond stronger and hence shorter. In [[fluorosulfuric acid]] solution, deep-blue {{chem|I|2|+}} reversibly dimerises below −60&amp;nbsp;°C, forming red rectangular diamagnetic {{chem|I|4|2+}}. Other polyiodine cations are not as well-characterised, including bent dark-brown or black {{chem|I|3|+}} and centrosymmetric ''C''&lt;sub&gt;2''h''&lt;/sub&gt; green or black {{chem|I|5|+}}, known in the {{chem|AsF|6|-}} and {{chem|AlCl|4|-}} salts among others.&lt;ref name=King/&gt;&lt;ref name=Greenwood842&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 842–4&lt;/ref&gt;

The only important polyiodide anion in aqueous solution is linear [[triiodide]], {{chem|I|3|-}}. Its formation explains why the solubility of iodine in water may be increased by the addition of potassium iodide solution:&lt;ref name=King/&gt;
:I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + I&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; {{eqm}} {{chem|I|3|-}} (''K''&lt;sub&gt;eq&lt;/sub&gt; = ~700 at 20&amp;nbsp;°C)
Many other polyiodides may be found when solutions containing iodine and iodide crystallise, such as {{chem|I|5|-}}, {{chem|I|9|-}}, {{chem|I|4|2-}}, and {{chem|I|8|2-}}, whose salts with large, weakly polarising cations such as [[caesium|Cs&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]] may be isolated.&lt;ref name=King/&gt;&lt;ref name=Greenwood835&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 835–9&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[carbon]]–iodine bond is a common functional group that forms part of core [[organic chemistry]]; formally, these compounds may be thought of as organic derivatives of the iodide anion. The simplest organoiodine compounds, [[alkyl iodide]]s, may be synthesised by the reaction of [[alcohol]]s with [[phosphorus triiodide]]; these may then be used in [[nucleophilic substitution]] reactions, or for preparing [[Grignard reagent]]s. The C–I bond is the weakest of all the carbon–halogen bonds due to the minuscule difference in electronegativity between carbon (2.55) and iodine (2.66). As such, iodide is the best [[leaving group]] among the halogens, to such an extent that many organoiodine compounds turn yellow when stored over time due to decomposition into elemental iodine; as such, they are commonly used in [[organic synthesis]], because of the easy formation and cleavage of the C–I bond.&lt;ref&gt;{{Ullmann | author = Phyllis A.

Some drawbacks of using organoiodine compounds as compared to organochlorine or organobromine compounds is the greater expense and toxicity of the iodine derivatives, since iodine is expensive and organoiodine compounds are stronger alkylating agents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher = Oxford University|title = Safety data for iodomethane|url = http://msds.chem.ox.ac.uk/IO/iodomethane.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[iodoacetamide]] and [[iodoacetic acid]] denature proteins by irreversibly alkylating [[cysteine]] residues and preventing the reformation of [[disulfide]] linkages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1432-1033.1979.tb13196.x|author=Polgar, L|title=Deuterium isotope effects on papain acylation.

Halogen exchange to produce iodoalkanes by the [[Finkelstein reaction]] is slightly complicated by the fact that iodide is a better leaving group than chloride or bromide. The difference is nevertheless small enough that the reaction can be driven to completion by exploiting the differential solubility of halide salts, or by using a large excess of the halide salt.&lt;ref name=March/&gt; In the classic Finkelstein reaction, an [[alkyl chloride]] or an [[alkyl bromide]] is converted to an [[alkyl iodide]] by treatment with a solution of [[sodium iodide]] in [[acetone]].

==Occurrence and production==
Iodine is the least abundant of the stable halogens, comprising only 0.46&amp;nbsp;[[parts per million]] of Earth's crustal rocks (compare: fluorine 544&amp;nbsp;ppm, chlorine 126&amp;nbsp;ppm, bromine 2.5&amp;nbsp;ppm). Among the eighty-four elements which occur in significant quantities (elements 1–42, 44–60, 62–83, and 90–92), it ranks sixty-first in abundance.&lt;ref name=Greenwood795&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 795–6&lt;/ref&gt; Iodide minerals are rare, and most deposits that are concentrated enough for economical extraction are [[iodate]] minerals instead. Examples include [[lautarite]], Ca(IO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and [[dietzeite]], 7Ca(IO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;·8CaCrO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name=Greenwood795/&gt; These are the minerals that occur as trace impurities in the [[caliche]], found in Chile, whose main product is [[sodium nitrate]]. In total, they can contain at least 0.02% and at most 1% iodine by weight.&lt;ref name="Elzea"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Industrial Minerals &amp; Rocks: Commodities, Markets, and Uses|publisher = SME|date = 2006|isbn = 978-0-87335-233-8|url = https://www.google.com/books?id=zNicdkuulE4C|pages = 541–552|last = Kogel |first=Jessica Elzea |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sodium iodate]] is extracted from the caliche and reduced to iodide by [[sodium bisulfite]]. This solution is then reacted with freshly extracted iodate, resulting in comproportionation to iodine, which may be filtered off.&lt;ref name=Greenwood800/&gt;

The caliche was the main source of iodine in the 19th century and continues to be important today, replacing [[kelp]] (which is no longer an economically viable source),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| url = https://books.google.com/?id=wW8KAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA185|first = Edward C. C.|last = Stanford|journal = Journal of the Society of Arts|title = On the Economic Applications of Seaweed|date = 1862|pages = 185–189}}&lt;/ref&gt; but in the late 20th century [[brine]]s emerged as a comparable source. The Japanese [[Minami Kanto gas field]] east of [[Tokyo]] and the American [[Anadarko Basin]] gas field in northwest [[Oklahoma]] are the two largest such sources. The brine is hotter than 60&amp;nbsp;°C from the depth of the source. The [[brine]] is first [[List of purification methods in chemistry|purified]] and acidified using [[sulfuric acid]], then the iodide present is oxidised to iodine with [[chlorine]]. An iodine solution is produced, but is dilute and must be concentrated. Air is blown into the solution to [[evaporate]] the iodine, which is passed into an absorbing tower where [[sulfur dioxide]] reduces the iodine. The [[hydrogen iodide]] (HI) is reacted with chlorine to precipitate the iodine. After filtering and purification the iodine is packed.&lt;ref name="Elzea"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|journal = Geochemical Journal|volume = 40|page = 475| date = 2006|title = Chemical and isotopic compositions of brines from dissolved-in-water type natural gas fields in Chiba, Japan|last = Maekawa |first=Tatsuo |last2=Igari |first2=Shun-Ichiro |last3=Kaneko |first3=Nobuyuki |doi = 10.2343/geochemj.40.475|issue = 5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These sources ensure that Chile and Japan are the largest producers of iodine today.&lt;ref name=Greenwood795/&gt; Alternatively, the brine may be treated with [[silver nitrate]] to precipitate out iodine as [[silver iodide]], which is then decomposed by reaction with iron to form metallic silver and a solution of [[iron(II) iodide]]. The iodine may then be liberated by displacement with [[chlorine]].&lt;ref name=Greenwood799&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, p. 799&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
Unlike chlorine and bromine, which have one significant main use dwarfing all others, iodine is used in many applications of varying importance. About half of all produced iodine goes into various organoiodine compounds; another 15% remains as the pure element, another 15% is used to form [[potassium iodide]], and another 15% for other inorganic iodine compounds. The remaining 5% is for minor uses. Among the major uses of iodine compounds are [[catalyst]]s, animal feed supplements, stabilisers, dyes, colourants and pigments, pharmaceutical, sanitation (from [[tincture of iodine]]), and photography; minor uses include smog inhibition, [[cloud seeding]], and various uses in analytical chemistry.&lt;ref name=Greenwood800/&gt;

===Chemical Analysis===
[[File:Testing seed for starch.jpg|thumb|right|Testing a seed for starch with a solution of iodine]]
[[Potassium tetraiodomercurate(II)]], K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;HgI&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, is also known as Nessler's reagent. It is often used as a sensitive spot test for [[ammonia]]. Similarly, Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;HgI&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is used as a precipitating reagent to test for [[alkaloid]]s. The iodide and iodate anions are often used for quantitative volumetric analysis, for example in [[iodometry]] and the [[iodine clock reaction]] (in which iodine also serves as a test for starch, forming a dark blue complex),&lt;ref name=Greenwood800/&gt; and aqueous alkaline iodine solution is used in the iodoform test for methyl ketones.&lt;ref name=March/&gt; The iodine test for starch is still used to detect [[counterfeit]] banknotes printed on starch-containing paper.&lt;ref name=Emsley&gt;{{cite book | last = Emsley | first = John | title = Nature's Building Blocks | edition = Hardcover, First | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] | date = 2001 | pages = 244–250 | isbn = 0-19-850340-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Spectroscopy ===
The spectra of the iodine molecule, I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, consists of (not exclusively)  tens of thousands of sharp spectral lines in the wavelength range 500-700&amp;nbsp;nm. Which is why it is such a commonly used wavelength reference (secondary standard). By measuring with a [[Saturated absorption spectroscopy|spectroscopic Doppler-free technique]] while focusing on one of these lines, the [[Hyperfine structure|hyperfine]] structure of the iodine molecule reveals itself. A line is now resolved such that either 15 components, (from even rotational quantum numbers, J&lt;sub&gt;even&lt;/sub&gt;), or 21 components (from odd rotational quantum numbers, J&lt;sub&gt;odd&lt;/sub&gt;) are measurable.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

===Medicine===
====Elemental iodine====
{{Main|Iodine (medical use)}}
Elemental iodine is used as a disinfectant either as the element, or as the water-soluble [[triiodide]] anion I&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; generated ''in situ'' by adding [[iodide]] to poorly water-soluble elemental iodine (the reverse chemical reaction makes some free elemental iodine available for antisepsis). Elemental iodine may also be used to treat [[iodine deficiency]].&lt;ref name=WHO2008&gt;{{cite book|title=WHO Model Formulary 2008|date=2009|publisher=World Health Organization|isbn=9789241547659|page=499|url=http://apps.who.int/medicinedocs/documents/s16879e/s16879e.pdf|accessdate= 8 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the alternative, iodine may be produced from [[iodophor]]s, which contain iodine complexed with a solubilizing agent (iodide ion may be thought of loosely as the iodophor in triiodide water solutions). Examples of such preparations include:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Block |first=Seymour Stanton |title=Disinfection, sterilization, and preservation |publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins |location=Hagerstwon, MD |date=2001 |page=159 |isbn=0-683-30740-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Tincture of iodine]]: iodine in ethanol, or iodine and [[sodium iodide]] in a mixture of ethanol and water.
* [[Lugol's iodine]]: iodine and iodide in water alone, forming mostly triiodide. Unlike tincture of iodine, Lugol's iodine has a minimised amount of the free iodine (I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) component.
* [[Povidone iodine]] (an [[iodophor]]).

The antimicrobial action of iodine is quick and works at low concentrations, and thus it is used in operating theatres.&lt;ref&gt;

It penetrates into microorganisms and attacks particular amino acids (such as [[cysteine]] and [[methionine]]), [[nucleotides]], and [[fatty acid]]s, ultimately resulting in [[cell death]]. It also has an [[antiviral]] action, but nonlipid viruses and [[parvovirus]]es are less sensitive than lipid enveloped viruses. Iodine probably attacks surface proteins of [[Viral envelope|enveloped]] viruses, and it may also destabilise membrane fatty acids by reacting with [[Saturated and unsaturated compounds|unsaturated]] [[Carbon–carbon bond|carbon bonds]].&lt;ref name="pmid9880479"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=McDonnell G, Russell AD | title=Antiseptics and disinfectants: activity, action, and resistance. | journal=Clin Microbiol Rev | year= 1999 | volume= 12 | issue= 1 | pages= 147–79 | pmid=9880479 | doi= | pmc=88911 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Other formulations====
In medicine, a saturated solution of [[potassium iodide]] is used to treat acute [[thyrotoxicosis]]. It is also used to block uptake of [[iodine-131]] in the thyroid gland (see isotopes section above), when this isotope is used as part of radiopharmaceuticals (such as [[iobenguane]]) that are not targeted to the thyroid or thyroid-type tissues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hazard.com/msds/mf/baker/baker/files/p5906.htm |title=Solubility of KI in water |publisher=Hazard.com |date=1998-04-21 |accessdate=2013-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20111007202042/https://www.eanm.org/scientific_info/guidelines/gl_radio_ther_benzyl.pdf?PHPSESSID=46d05b62d235c36a12166bf939b656c7&lt;/ref&gt;

Iodine-131 (usually as iodide) is a component of [[nuclear fallout]], and is particularly dangerous owing to the thyroid gland's propensity to concentrate ingested iodine and retain it for periods longer than this isotope's radiological half-life of eight days. For this reason, people at risk of exposure to environmental radioactive iodine (iodine-131) in fallout may be instructed to take non-radioactive potassium iodide tablets. The typical adult dose is one 130&amp;nbsp;mg tablet per 24 hours, supplying 100&amp;nbsp;mg (100,000 [[micrograms]]) of ionic iodine. (The typical daily dose of iodine for normal health is of order 100 micrograms; see "Dietary Intake" below.) Ingestion of this large dose of non-radioactive iodine minimises the uptake of radioactive iodine by the thyroid gland.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Centers for Disease Control [http://www.emergency.cdc.gov/radiation/ki.asp "CDC Radiation Emergencies"], ''U.S. Centers for Disease Control'', 11 October 2006, accessed 14 November 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Others===
The production of [[ethylenediamine dihydroiodide]], provided as a nutritional supplement for livestock, consumes a large portion of available iodine. Another significant use is a catalyst for the production of [[acetic acid]] by the [[Monsanto process|Monsanto]] and [[Cativa process]]es. In these technologies, which support the world's demand for acetic acid, [[hydroiodic acid]] converts the [[methanol]] feedstock into methyl iodide, which undergoes [[carbonylation]]. Hydrolysis of the resulting acetyl iodide regenerates hydroiodic acid and gives acetic acid.&lt;ref name=Ullmann&gt;Lyday, Phyllis A.; Tatsuo Kaiho"Iodine and Iodine Compounds" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, 2015, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, {{doi|10.1002/14356007.a14_381.pub2}} Vol. A14 pp. 382–390.&lt;/ref&gt;

Inorganic iodides find specialised uses. Titanium, zirconium, hafnium, and [[thorium]] are purified by the [[van Arkel process]], which involves the reversible formation of the tetraiodides of these elements. Silver iodide is a major ingredient to traditional photographic film. Thousands of kilograms of silver iodide are used annually for [[cloud seeding]] to induce rain.&lt;ref name = Ullmann/&gt;

The organoiodine compound [[erythrosine]] is an important food coloring agent. Perfluoroalkyl iodides are precursors to important surfactants, such as [[perfluorooctanesulfonic acid]].&lt;ref name = Ullmann/&gt;

A deficiency of iodine leads to decreased production of T&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and T&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and a concomitant enlargement of the [[thyroid|thyroid tissue]] in an attempt to obtain more iodine, causing the disease known as [[simple goitre]]. The major form of thyroid hormone in the blood is thyroxine (T&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), which has a longer half-life than T&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. In humans, the ratio of T&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; to T&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; released into the blood is between 14:1 and 20:1.

Fifteen to 20&amp;nbsp;mg of iodine is concentrated in thyroid tissue and hormones, but 70% of all iodine in the body is found in other tissues, including mammary glands, eyes, gastric mucosa, fetal thymus, cerebro-spinal fluid and choroid plexus, arterial walls, the cervix, and salivary glands. In the cells of those tissues, iodide enters directly by [[sodium-iodide symporter]] (NIS).

Recommendations by the United States [[Institute of Medicine]] are between 110 and 130 [[microgram|µg]] for infants up to 12 months, 90&amp;nbsp;µg for children up to eight years, 130&amp;nbsp;µg for children up to 13 years, 150&amp;nbsp;µg for adults, 220&amp;nbsp;µg for pregnant women and 290&amp;nbsp;µg for lactation.&lt;ref name=lpi/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iom.edu/en/Global/News%20Announcements/~/media/Files/Activity%20Files/Nutrition/DRIs/DRISummaryListing2.ashx |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091030004039/http://iom.edu/en/Global/News%20Announcements/~/media/Files/Activity%20Files/Nutrition/DRIs/DRISummaryListing2.ashx |dead-url=yes |archive-date=30 October 2009 |title=Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs): Recommended Intakes for Individuals, Vitamins |publisher=[[Institute of Medicine]] |date=2004 |accessdate=9 June 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL) for adults is 1,100&amp;nbsp;μg/day.&lt;ref name="InstituteofMedicine"&gt;{{Cite book| author = United States National Research Council| date = 2000|title = Dietary Reference Intakes for Vitamin A, Vitamin K, Arsenic, Boron, Chromium, Copper, Iodine, Iron, Manganese, Molybdenum, Nickel, Silicon, Vanadium, and Zinc|pages = 258–259| publisher = National Academies Press| url = http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=10026&amp;page=258}}&lt;/ref&gt; This upper limit was assessed by analyzing the effect of supplementation on [[thyroid-stimulating hormone]].&lt;ref name="Patrick2008"/&gt;

As of 2000, the median intake of iodine from food in the United States was 240 to 300&amp;nbsp;μg/day for men and 190 to 210&amp;nbsp;μg/day for women.&lt;ref name="InstituteofMedicine" /&gt; The general US population has adequate iodine nutrition,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Caldwell KL, Makhmudov A, Ely E, Jones RL, Wang RY |title=Iodine status of the U.S. population, National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 2005–2006 and 2007–2008 |journal=Thyroid |volume=21 |issue=4 |pages=419–27 |year=2011 |pmid=21323596 |doi=10.1089/thy.2010.0077 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lueng"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Leung AM, Braverman LE, Pearce EN |title=History of U.S. iodine fortification and supplementation |journal=Nutrients |volume=4 |issue=11 |pages=1740–6 |year=2012 |pmid=23201844 |pmc=3509517 |doi=10.3390/nu4111740 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; with women of childbearing age and pregnant women having a possible mild risk of deficiency.&lt;ref name="Lueng"/&gt; In Japan, consumption was considered much higher, ranging between 5,280&amp;nbsp;μg/day to 13,800&amp;nbsp;μg/day from dietary seaweed or [[kombu]] kelp,&lt;ref name="Patrick2008"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Patrick |first=L. |title=Iodine: deficiency and therapeutic considerations |journal=Altern Med Rev |volume=13 |date=2008 |pmid=18590348 |url=http://www.thorne.com/altmedrev/.fulltext/13/2/116.pdf |issue=2 |pages=116–27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130531112100/http://www.thorne.com/altmedrev/.fulltext/13/2/116.pdf |archivedate=31 May 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; often in the form of Kombu [[Umami]] extracts for soup stock and potato chips.

After iodine fortification programs such as iodisation of salt have been implemented, some cases of iodine-induced [[hyperthyroidism]] have been observed (so-called [[Jod-Basedow phenomenon]]). The condition seems to occur mainly in people over forty, and the risk appears higher when iodine deficiency is severe and the initial rise in iodine intake is high.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wu |first=T. |last2=Liu |first2=G.

Elemental iodine (I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is [[toxicity|toxic]] if taken orally undiluted. The lethal dose for an adult human is 30&amp;nbsp;mg/kg, which is about 2.1–2.4&amp;nbsp;grams for a human weighing 70 to 80&amp;nbsp;kg (even if experiments on rats demonstrated that these animals could survive after eating a 14000&amp;nbsp;mg/kg dose). Excess iodine can be more [[cytotoxicity|cytotoxic]] in the presence of [[selenium deficiency]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Elemental iodine is also a skin irritant, and direct contact with skin can cause damage and solid iodine crystals should be handled with care. Solutions with high elemental iodine concentration, such as [[tincture of iodine]] and [[Lugol's solution]], are capable of causing [[dermatoxin|tissue damage]] if used in prolonged cleaning or antisepsis; similarly, liquid [[Povidone-iodine]] (Betadine) trapped against the skin resulted in chemical burns in some reported cases.&lt;ref name="Lowe"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Povidone-iodine-induced burn: case report and review of the literature |last = Lowe |first=D.

=== Occupational exposure ===
People can be exposed to iodine in the workplace by inhalation, ingestion, skin contact, and eye contact. The [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] (OSHA) has set the legal limit ([[Permissible exposure limit]]) for iodine exposure in the workplace at 0.1 ppm (1&amp;nbsp;mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) during an 8-hour workday. The [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] (NIOSH) has set a [[Recommended exposure limit]] (REL) of 0.1&amp;nbsp;ppm (1&amp;nbsp;mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) during an 8-hour workday. At levels of 2 ppm, iodine is [[IDLH|immediately dangerous to life and health]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = CDC - NIOSH Pocket Guide to Chemical Hazards - Iodine|url = https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npg/npgd0342.html|website = www.cdc.gov|accessdate = 2015-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Allergic reactions===
Some people develop a [[hypersensitivity]] to products and foods containing iodine. Applications of tincture of iodine or Betadine can cause rashes, sometimes severe.&lt;ref name=dermnet&gt;DermNet New Zealand Trust, [http://www.dermnetnz.org/treatments/iodine.html Iodine]&lt;/ref&gt; [[wikt:parenteral|Parenteral]] use of iodine-based contrast agents (see above) can cause reactions ranging from a mild rash to fatal [[anaphylaxis]]. Such reactions have led to the misconception (widely held, even among physicians) that some people are allergic to iodine itself; even allergies to iodine-rich seafood have been so construed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Boehm | first1 = I | year = 2008 | title = Seafood allergy and radiocontrast media: Are physicians propagating a myth? | url = | journal = Am J Med | volume = 121 | issue = 8| pages = E19–E19 | doi = 10.1016/j.amjmed.2008.03.035 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, there has never been a confirmed report of a true iodine allergy, and an allergy to elemental iodine or simple iodide salts is theoretically impossible.

Patients with various food allergies (shellfish, egg, milk, etc.) or asthma are more likely to suffer reactions to contrast media containing iodine.&lt;ref name=ucsf /&gt;  As with all medications, the patient's allergy history should be questioned and consulted before any containing iodine are administered.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Katelaris |first=Constance |date=2009 |title='Iodine Allergy' label is misleading |journal=Australian Prescriber |volume=32 |pages=125–128 |url=http://www.australianprescriber.com/magazine/32/5/125/8/ |issue=5 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303175503/http://www.australianprescriber.com/magazine/32/5/125/8/ |archivedate=3 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the theory of many-particle systems, '''Jacobi coordinates''' often are used to simplify the mathematical formulation.  These coordinates are particularly common in treating polyatomic [[molecule]]s and [[chemical reaction]]s,&lt;ref name= Zhang&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[celestial mechanics]].&lt;ref name=Belbruno&gt;

For example, see {{cite book |title=Capture Dynamics and Chaotic Motions in Celestial Mechanics |author= Edward Belbruno |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dK-fl0KrOEIC&amp;pg=PA9 |page=9 |isbn=0-691-09480-2 |date=2004 |publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]}}

&lt;/ref&gt; An algorithm for generating the Jacobi coordinates for ''N'' bodies may be based upon [[binary trees]].&lt;ref name=Cabral&gt;

{{cite book |title=Classical and celestial mechanics |author= Hildeberto Cabral, Florin Diacu |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q1emz4C4lYQC&amp;pg=PA230 |page=230 |chapter=Appendix A: Canonical transformations to Jacobi coordinates |isbn=0-691-05022-8 |publisher=Princeton University Press |date=2002}}

&lt;/ref&gt; In words, the algorithm is described as follows:&lt;ref name=Cabral/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Let ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; be the masses of two bodies that are replaced by a new body of virtual mass ''M'' = ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; + ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;. The position coordinates '''x'''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; and '''x'''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; are replaced by their relative position  '''r'''&lt;sub&gt;''jk''&lt;/sub&gt; = '''x'''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;'''x'''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; and by the vector to their center of mass '''R'''&lt;sub&gt;''jk''&lt;/sub&gt; = (''m''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; ''q''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; + ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;''q''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;)/(''m''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; +  ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;). The node in the binary tree corresponding to the virtual body has ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; as its right child and ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; as its left child. The order of children indicates the relative coordinate points from '''x'''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; to '''x'''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;. Repeat the above step for ''N''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1 bodies, that is, the ''N''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;2 original bodies plus the new virtual body. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

For the [[N-body problem|''N''-body problem]] the result is:&lt;ref name=Cornille&gt;{{cite book |title=Advanced electromagnetism and vacuum physics |author=Patrick Cornille |page=102 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y8sSFTDkQ20C&amp;pg=PA102 |chapter=Partition of forces using Jacobi coordinates  |isbn=981-238-367-0 |date=2003 |publisher=World Scientific}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{r_j }= \frac{1}{m_{0j}} \sum_{k=1}^j m_k\boldsymbol {x_k} \ - \ \boldsymbol{x_{j+1}}\ , \quad (j = 1, 2, \dots, N-1)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{r_N }= \frac{1}{m_{0N}} \sum_{k=1}^N m_k\boldsymbol {x_k} \ , &lt;/math&gt;

with

:&lt;math&gt;m_{0j} = \sum_{k=1}^j \ m_k \ . &lt;/math&gt;

The vector &lt;math&gt; \boldsymbol{r_N} &lt;/math&gt; is the [[center of mass]] of all the bodies:

The result one is left with is thus a system of ''N''-1 translationally invariant coordinates &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{r_1}, \dots, \boldsymbol{r_{N-1}}&lt;/math&gt; and a center of mass coordinate &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{r_N}&lt;/math&gt;, from iteratively reducing two-body systems within the many-body system.

'''Krogmann's salt''' is a mixed-[[valence (chemistry)|valence]] [[square planar]] [[coordination complex]] of [[platinum]] and [[cyanide]] bonded through linear platinum metal chains, sometimes described as molecular wires.

Although the term Krogmann’s salt most commonly refers to a platinum metal [[Coordination complex|complex]] of the formula K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;[Pt(CN)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;X&lt;sub&gt;0.3&lt;/sub&gt;] where X is usually [[bromine]] (or sometimes [[chlorine]]), a number of non-[[stoichiometric]] metal salts containing the [[anionic]] complex [Pt(CN)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt; can also be characterized under the blanket term “Krogmann’s salts.”

Modeled as an infinite [[one-dimensional]] molecular chain of platinum atoms, the high [[anisotropy]] and restricted [[dimensionality]] of Krogmann’s salt and related compounds are becoming increasingly attractive properties for many facets of [[nanotechnology]].&lt;ref name="Bera"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Bera, J.

==History==

Krogmann's salt was first synthesized by Klaus Krogmann in the late 1960s at the [[University of Stuttgart]] in [[Germany]].  Krogmann published the original journal article documenting the synthesis and characterization of the salt in 1969.&lt;ref name="Krogmann"&gt;{{ cite journal |author= Krogmann, K. |journal= [[Angew. Chem.]] |year= 1969 |volume= 81 |issue= 1 |pages= 10–17 |title= Planare Komplexe mit Metall-Metall-Bindungen |doi= 10.1002/ange.19690810103 |language= German }} {{ cite journal |author= Krogmann, K. |journal= [[Angew.

==Structure and physical properties==
[[File:Anion-chains-from-cyanoplatinates-compared-3D-balls.png|thumb|right|330px|''n''[Pt(CN)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt; → ([Pt(CN)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;1.7−&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;]]

Krogmann’s salt is a series of partially [[oxidized]] tetracyanoplatinate complexes linked by the platinum-platinum bonds on the top and bottom faces of the planar [Pt(CN)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;n−&lt;/sup&gt; anions.  This salt forms infinite stacks in the solid state based on the overlap of the d&lt;sub&gt;z2&lt;/sub&gt; [[atomic orbital|orbitals]].&lt;ref name="Bera"/&gt;

Krogmann’s salt has a [[tetragonal]] crystal structure with a Pt-Pt distance of 2.880 [[angstroms]], which is much shorter than the metal-metal bond distances in other planar platinum complexes such as Ca[Pt(CN)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]·5H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (3.36 angstroms), Sr[Pt(CN)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]·5H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (3.58 angstroms), and Mg[Pt(CN)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]·7H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (3.16 angstroms).&lt;ref name="Krogmann"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal |author1=Krogmann, K. |author2=Hausen, H. D. Z. |journal= Z. Anorg. Allg. Chem. |year= 1968 |volume= 358 |pages= 67 |title= Pt-Chain Structures. 1. Potassium Tetracyanoplatinate Violets K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;[Pt(CN)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]X&lt;sub&gt;0,3&lt;/sub&gt;·2,5H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (X=Cl,Br) }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Pt-Pt distance in Krogmann's salt is only 0.1 angstroms longer than in platinum metal.&lt;ref&gt;Heger, G.; Deiseroth, H.J.; Schulz, H. "Combined X-ray and neutron diffraction study of K2 (Pt(CN)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)X&lt;sub&gt;0.3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;.&lt;/sup&gt;3(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) with X= Br, Cl (KCP) between 31 K and room temperature" Acta Crystallographica B 1982, volume 24,1968-38. (1978) 34, p725-p731.&lt;/ref&gt;

Each [[unit cell]] contains a site for Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;, corresponding to 0.5 Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; per Pt.  However, this site is only filled 64% of the time, giving 0.32 Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; per Pt in the actual compound. Because of this, the [[oxidation number]] of Pt does not rise above +2.32.&lt;ref name="Krogmann"/&gt;

Krogmann’s salt has no recognizable phase range and is characterized by broad and intense intervalence bands in its electronic spectra.&lt;ref name="Clar"&gt;{{ cite journal |author1=Clar, R. J. H. |author2=Cround, V. B. |author3=Khokhar, A. R. |journal= [[Inorg.

==Chemical properties==

One of the most widely researched properties of Krogmann’s salt is its unusual electric conductance.  Because of its linear chain structure and overlap of the platinum &lt;math&gt;d_{z^2}&lt;/math&gt; orbitals, Krogmann’s salt is an excellent conductor of [[electricity]].&lt;ref name="Bera"/&gt;  This property makes it an attractive material for nanotechnology.&lt;ref name="Wu"&gt;{{ cite journal |author1=Wu, D. Y. |author2=Zhang, T. L. |journal= [[Prog. Chem.]] |year= 2004 |volume= 16 |issue= 6 |pages= 911–917 |title= Recent developments in linear chain clusters of low-valent platinum group metals |doi= |language= Chinese }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Preparation==

The usual preparation of Krogmann's salt involves the evaporation of a 5:1 [[Mole (unit)|molar]] ratio mixture of the salts K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;[Pt(CN)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;] and K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;[Pt(CN)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Br&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] in water to give copper-colored needles of K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;[Pt(CN)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]Br&lt;sub&gt;0.32&lt;/sub&gt;·2.6 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O.

::5K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;[Pt(CN)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;] + K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;[Pt(CN)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Br&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] + 15.6 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → 6K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;[Pt(CN)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]Br&lt;sub&gt;0.32&lt;/sub&gt;·2.6 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

Because excess Pt&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; or Pt&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt; complex crystallizes out with the product when the reactant ratio is changed, the product is therefore well defined, although [[non-stoichiometric]].&lt;ref name="Krogmann"/&gt;

==Uses==

Although there was a large body of research and literature generated on molecular wire-type metal complexes through the mid-1980s, interest in stacked metal-metal bonds saw a decline until only very recently.  Due to the explosion of nanotechnology in the 2010s, many researchers have taken a renewed interest in Krogmann's salt and its related compounds due to their high anisotropy, restricted dimensionality, and unique [[Electrical conductance|conductance]] properties.

A new group of platinum chains based on alternating cations and anions of [Pt(CNR)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; (R = ''i''Pr, ''c-''C&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;23&lt;/sub&gt;, ''p-''(C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) and [Pt(CN)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt; is undergoing current research.&lt;ref name="Bera"/&gt;  These may be able to be used as [[vapochromic]] [[sensor]] materials, or materials which change color when exposed to different vapors.&lt;ref name="Grate"&gt;{{ cite journal |author1=Grate, J.

Similar to Krogmann’s platinum salt, it has been shown that it is possible to stabilize metal chains with only [[Saturation (chemistry)|unsaturated]] [[hydrocarbons]], or olefins.  Current research indicates that mononuclear [[Palladium|Pd]]&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; and Pd&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; react with [[conjugated system|conjugated]] [[polyenes]] to give linear chains of Pd-Pd bonds protected by a “π-electron sheath.”&lt;ref name="Bera"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mino"&gt;{{ cite journal |author= T., Mino, Y., Mochizuki, E., Kai, Y., Kurosawa, H. |journal= [[J.

Not only do these olefin-stabilized metal chains constitute a significant contribution to the field of [[organometallic chemistry]], both the complex’s metal atom structures and the [[olefin]] [[ligands]] themselves can conduct a current.&lt;ref name="Bera"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Murahashi '00"&gt;{{ cite journal |author= Murahashi, T., Nagai, Okuno, T., Matsutani, T., Kurosawa, H. |journal= [[Chem.

The '''Kuznetsov NK-14A''' was an onboard [[nuclear-powered]] engine which was made to be used on the [[Tupolev Tu-119]] nuclear-powered aircraft, designed and built by the Soviet [[Kuznetsov Design Bureau]]. The design of the plane was based on a modified [[Tupolev Tu-95]] and would be fitted with two Kuznetsov NK-14A nuclear-fuelled engines inboard fed with heat from a fuselage mounted reactor and two Kerosene-fed [[Kuznetsov NK-12]] turboprops outboard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Butler|first1=Tony|last2=Yefim|first2=Gordan|title=Soviet secret projects : Bombers since 1945|date=2004|publisher=Hinckley: Midland Publishing|isbn=978-1-85780-194-1|chapter=Chapter 6: Nuclear Power and Flying Wings}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Development was suspended with the cancellation of the Tu-119, but flight trials would have been made initially fitted to the inboard nacelles of the [[Tu-119]] prototype.&lt;ref name=GordonTu&gt;{{cite book|title=OKB Tupolev: A History of the Design Bureau and its Aircraft|last=Gordon|first=Yefim|year=2005|publisher=Midland Publishing|location=Hinkley|isbn=1 85780 214 4|edition=1st|author2=Vladimir Rigmant |pages=155–157}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a '''list of minerals''' ''for which there are articles on Wikipedia''. 

[[Mineral]]s are distinguished by various chemical and physical properties. Differences in chemical composition and crystal structure distinguish the various ''species''. Within a mineral species there may be variation in physical properties or minor amounts of impurities that are recognized by mineralogists or wider society as a mineral ''variety''. 

Mineral variety names and [[mineraloid]]s are to be listed after the valid minerals for each letter.

In [[condensed matter physics]], the '''Lyddane–Sachs–Teller relation''' (or LST relation) determines the ratio of the natural frequency of longitudinal optic lattice vibrations ([[phonon]]s) (&lt;math&gt;\omega_L&lt;/math&gt;) of an ion crystal to the natural frequency of the transverse optical lattice vibration (&lt;math&gt;\omega_T&lt;/math&gt;) for long wavelengths (zero wavevector).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lyddane|first1=R.|last2=Sachs|first2=R.|last3=Teller|first3=E.|title=On the Polar Vibrations of Alkali Halides|journal=Physical Review|volume=59|issue=8|pages=673–676|doi=10.1103/PhysRev.59.673|bibcode = 1941PhRv...59..673L |year=1941}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ratio is equal to the ratio of the static permittivity &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_{st}&lt;/math&gt; (Often also &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon(0)&lt;/math&gt;) to the permittivity for frequencies in the visible range &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_{\infty}&lt;/math&gt; (often also &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon(\omega_s)&lt;/math&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=2KHcmmmbf_gC&amp;pg=PA363&amp;lpg=PA363&amp;dq=r.+h.+lyddane&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=0ogaDze8Vr&amp;sig=hqJp7LBue1fN0qySAdRqBXVQnv0&amp;hl=de&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=RyAhT-ivA4Twsgb8qODJBw&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CGsQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=r.%20h.%20lyddane&amp;f=false Laurence Charles, Robinson: The Lyddane-Sachs-Teller-relationship]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Lyddane–Sachs–Teller relation is named after the physicists R. H. Lyddane, [[Edward Teller]], and R. G. Sachs.

== Origin and limitations ==

[[Image:Phonon polaritons.svg|thumb|270px|[[Dispersion relation]] of phonon polaritons in [[Gallium phosphide|GaP]]. Red curves are the uncoupled phonon and photon dispersion relations, black curves are the result of coupling (from top to bottom: upper polariton, LO phonon, lower polariton). The LST relation relates the frequencies of the horizontal red curve (&lt;math&gt;\omega_T&lt;/math&gt;) and the black curve intercept at k=0 (&lt;math&gt;\omega_L&lt;/math&gt;). ]]

The Lyddane–Sachs–Teller relation applies to optical lattice vibrations that have an associated net [[polarization density]], so that they can produce long ranged electromagnetic fields (over ranges much longer than the inter-atom distances). The relation assumes an idealized polar ("infrared active") optical lattice vibration that gives a contribution to the frequency-dependent [[permittivity]] described by a lossless Lorentzian oscillator:
:&lt;math&gt;
\epsilon(\omega) = \epsilon(\infty) + S \frac{\omega_T^2}{\omega^2 - \omega_T^2},
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\epsilon(\infty)&lt;/math&gt; is the permittivity at high frequencies, &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is the static polarizability of the optical lattice mode, and &lt;math&gt;\omega_T&lt;/math&gt; is the "natural" oscillation frequency of the lattice vibration taking into account only the short-ranged (microscopic) restoring forces.
The above equation can be plugged into [[Maxwell's equations]] to find the complete set of normal modes including all restoring forces (short-ranged and long-ranged), which are sometimes called [[phonon polariton]]s. In Maxwell's equations, an electric [[longitudinal wave]] occurs when the permittivity passes through zero, i.e.
:&lt;math&gt;\epsilon(\omega_L) = 0&lt;/math&gt;.
For the Lorentzian resonance described above, this longitudinal mode frequency is given by the Lyddane–Sachs–Teller relation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; A transverse resonance at &lt;math&gt;\omega_T&lt;/math&gt; is also present although it does not extend all the way to k=0 since for small, lightlike wavevectors, the magnetic fields generated by the transverse polarization currents cannot be neglected and lead to hybridizing of the lattice vibration with light (see figure).

Since the Lyddane–Sachs–Teller relation is derived from the lossless Lorentzian oscillator, it may break down in realistic materials where the permittivity function is more complicated for various reasons:
* Real phonons have losses (also known as damping or dissipation).
* Materials may have multiple phonon resonances that add together to produce the permittivity.
* There may be other electrically active degrees of freedom (notably, mobile electrons) and non-Lorentzian oscillators.
In the case of multiple, lossy Lorentzian oscillators, there are generalized Lyddane–Sachs–Teller relations available.&lt;ref name=chang&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chang|first1=I. F.|last2=Mitra|first2=S. S.|last3=Plendl|first3=J. N.|last4=Mansur|first4=L.

Most generally, the permittivity cannot be described as a combination of Lorentizan oscillators, and the longitudinal mode frequency can only be found as a [[complex zero]] in the permittivity function.&lt;ref name=chang/&gt;

'''PICO''' is an experiment searching for direct evidence of [[dark matter]] using a [[bubble chamber]] of [[chlorofluorocarbon]] ([[Freon]]) as the active mass.  It is located at [[SNOLAB]] in Canada.

It was formed in 2013 from the merger of two similar experiments, '''PICASSO''' and '''COUPP'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.snolab.ca/science/experiments/coupp |title=PICO |publisher=SNOLAB |accessdate=2015-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ipp.ca/programs/picasso.shtml |title=PICO/PICASSO |publisher=Institute of Particle Physics |accessdate=2015-12-02 |quote=The PICASSO and COUPP collaborations merged in 2013 to form the PICO collaboration.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PICASSO ('''P'''roject '''I'''n '''CA'''nada to '''S'''earch for [[Supersymmetry|'''S'''upersymmetric]] '''O'''bjects, or '''P'''rojet d''''I'''dentification de '''CA'''ndidats '''S'''upersymétriques  '''SO'''mbres in French) was an international collaboration with members from the [[Université de Montréal]], [[Queen's University]], [[Indiana University South Bend]] and [[Czech Technical University in Prague]], [[University of Alberta]], [[Laurentian University]] and BTI, Chalk River, Ontario. PICASSO is predominantly sensitive to [[spin (physics)|spin]]-dependent interactions of [[Weakly Interacting Massive Particle]]s (WIMPs) with [[fluorine]] atoms.

COUPP ('''C'''hicagoland '''O'''bservatory for '''U'''nderground '''P'''article '''P'''hysics) was a similar project with members from [[Fermilab]], [[University of Chicago]], and [[Indiana University]].  Prototypes were tested in the [[MINOS]] experiment far hall, with a scaled-up experiment also operating at SNOLAB.  It used [[trifluoroiodomethane]] (CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;I) as the medium.

==Principle==
A bubble detector is a radiation sensitive device that uses small droplets of superheated liquid that are suspended in a gel matrix.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bubbletech.ca/radiation_detectors_files/bubble_detectors.html |title=Bubble detector |accessdate=2008-12-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080320061130/http://www.bubbletech.ca/radiation_detectors_files/bubble_detectors.html |archivedate=2008-03-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It uses the principle of a [[bubble chamber]] but since only the small droplets can undergo a phase transition at a time, the detector can stay active for much longer periods than a classic bubble chamber. When enough energy is deposited in a droplet by ionizing radiation the superheated droplet undergoes a [[phase transition]] and becomes a gas bubble. The PICASSO detectors contain Freon droplets with an average diameter of {{val|200|u=um}}. The bubble development in the detector is accompanied by an acoustic shock wave that is picked up by [[piezo-electric]] sensors. The main advantage of the bubble detector technique is that the detector is almost insensitive to [[background radiation]]. The detector sensitivity can be adjusted by changing the temperature of the droplets. Freon-loaded detectors are typically operated at temperatures between {{Convert|15|-|55|C|F|-1}}.

The validity of the bubble detector concept has been shown in several publications.&lt;ref&gt;http://inspirehep.net/search?p=find+collaboration+picasso&amp;FORMAT=WWW&amp;SEQUENCE=&lt;/ref&gt; There is another similar experiment using this technique in Europe called [[SIMPLE (dark matter)|SIMPLE]].

==Results==
PICASSO reports results (November 2009) for spin-dependent [[Weakly interacting massive particle|WIMP]] interactions on [[Fluorine-19|&lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;F]]. No dark matter signal has been found, but for [[Weakly interacting massive particle|WIMP]] masses of {{val|24|ul=GeV/c2}} new stringent limits have been obtained on the spin-dependent cross section for WIMP scattering on &lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;F of {{val|13.9|u=[[barn (unit)|pb]]}} (90% [[confidence level|CL]]). This result has been converted into a cross section limit for WIMP interactions on protons of {{val|0.16|u=pb}} (90% CL). The obtained limits restrict recent interpretations of the [[DAMA/LIBRA]] annual modulation effect in terms of spin dependent interactions.&lt;ref&gt;

The '''Panaviska Recreation Area''' is located on the bench of Panasivka mountain stream between villages of [[Korostiv (Skole Raion)|Korostiv]] and [[Kozyova]] in [[Skole Raion]]. This is on the 666-kilometer along the highway ('''{{Highway M (Ukraine)|06}}''')  Kyiv-Chop.

It is a favorite spot as residents of the area and the car tourists. Back in the 1880 there were building recreation centers for children. On the territory of rest has gazebos, tables with benches, parking.

Also, there had once been famous "Guta Korostivska",&lt;ref&gt;[http://carpathians.eu/?id=1860 Коростівська Гута] {{uk icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; wherein worked 140 people. "Guta Korostivska" was once famous for its of glass products throughout Europe.

[[Image:Pump Jack labelled.png|thumb|A diagram of a pumpjack|350px]]

A '''pumpjack'''  is the overground drive for a reciprocating [[piston pump]] in an [[oil well]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sjvgeology.org/old_stuff/pumpjacks.html|title=Old Stuff from the Oil Fields - Pumping Jacks|website=www.sjvgeology.org|access-date=2017-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is used to mechanically lift liquid out of the well if not enough bottom hole pressure exists for the liquid to flow all the way to the surface. The arrangement is commonly used for onshore wells producing little oil. Pumpjacks are common in [[oil field|oil-rich areas]].

Depending on the size of the pump, it generally produces {{convert|5|to|40|litre|round=0.5}} of liquid at each stroke.  Often this is an [[emulsion]] of [[crude oil]] and water. Pump size is also determined by the depth and weight of the oil to remove, with deeper extraction requiring more power to move the increased weight of the discharge column (discharge head).

A pumpjack converts the rotary motion of the motor to a vertical reciprocating motion to drive the pump shaft, which is exhibited in the characteristic nodding motion. The engineering term for this type of mechanism is a [[Beam engine|walking beam]]. It was often employed in stationary and [[marine steam engine]] designs in the 18th and 19th centuries.

==Above ground==
In the early days, pumpjacks worked by rod lines running horizontally above the ground to a wheel on a rotating eccentric in a mechanism known as a central power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.petroleumhistory.org/OilHistory/pages/Central%20Power/centralpower.html |title=Oil History: The Central Power|accessdate=2011-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The central power, which might operate a dozen or more pumpjacks, would be powered by a steam or internal combustion engine or by an electric motor. Among the advantages of this scheme was only having one motor to power all the pumpjacks rather than individual motors for each. However, among the many difficulties was maintaining system balance as individual well loads changed.

Modern pumpjacks are powered by a [[Engine|prime mover]]. This is commonly an electric motor, but [[internal combustion engine]]s are used in isolated locations without access to electricity, or, in the cases of water pumpjacks, where three-phase power is not available (while single phase motors exist at least up to 60&amp;nbsp;hp,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.meridiumpower.ca/A/a_1.html|title=Single Phase Motors|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050226170113/http://www.meridiumpower.ca/A/a_1.html|archive-date=2005-02-26|dead-url=|access-date=2017-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; providing power to single-phase motors above 10 horsepower can cause powerline problems,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rerc.org/pdf_files/three_phase_options.pdf|title=Options Beyond Three-Phase For Serving Remote Motor Loads|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170402142452/https://www.rerc.org/pdf_files/three_phase_options.pdf|archive-date=April 2, 2017|dead-url=|access-date=April 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many pumps require more than 10 horsepower). Common [[Grid (electricity)|off-grid]] pumpjack engines run on natural gas, often casing gas produced from the well, but pumpjacks have been run on many types of fuel, such as propane and diesel fuel. In harsh climates, such motors and engines may be housed in a [[shack]] for protection from the elements. Engines that power water pumpjacks often receive natural gas from the nearest available gas grid.

The prime mover runs a set of pulleys to the transmission, often a double-reduction gearbox, which drives a pair of [[crank (mechanism)|cranks]], generally with [[counterweight]]s installed on them to assist the motor in lifting the heavy rod assembly. The cranks raise and lower one end of an [[I-beam]] which is free to move on an [[A-Frame|A-frame]]. On the other end of the beam is a curved metal box called a horse head or donkey head, so named due to its appearance. A cable made of steel—occasionally, [[fibreglass]]—called a bridle, connects the horse head to the polished rod, a [[piston]] that passes through the [[stuffing box]].

The cranks themselves also produce counterbalance due to their weight, so on pumpjacks that do not carry very heavy loads, the weight of the cranks themselves may be enough to balance the well load.

Sometimes, however, crank-balanced units can become prohibitively heavy due to the need for counterweights. Currently, [[Lufkin Industries]] offer "air-balanced" units, where counterbalance is provided by a pneumatic cylinder charged with air from a compressor, eliminating the need for counterweights.

The polished rod has a close fit to the stuffing box, letting it move in and out of the tubing without fluid escaping. (The tubing is a pipe that runs to the bottom of the well through which the liquid is produced.)  The bridle follows the curve of the horse head as it lowers and raises to create a vertical or nearly-vertical stroke.  The polished rod is connected to a long string of rods called sucker rods, which run through the tubing to the down-hole pump, usually positioned near the bottom of the well.

File:ViewintoHell-KernRiver.jpg|The densely developed [[Kern River Oil Field]], California: Hundreds of pumpjacks are visible in the full-size view. This style of development was common in the oil booms of the early 20th century.
&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Down-hole==
At the bottom of the tubing is the down-hole pump.  This pump has two [[check valve|ball check valves]]: a stationary valve at bottom called the standing valve, and a valve on the piston connected to the bottom of the sucker rods that travels up and down as the rods reciprocate, known as the traveling valve. Reservoir fluid enters from the formation into the bottom of the borehole through [[Perforation (oil well)|perforations]] that have been made through the casing and cement (the casing is a larger metal pipe that runs the length of the well, which has cement placed between it and the earth; the tubing, pump, and [[sucker rod]] are all inside the casing).

When the rods at the pump end are travelling up, the traveling valve is closed and the standing valve is open (due to the drop in pressure in the pump barrel).  Consequently, the pump barrel fills with the fluid from the formation as the traveling piston lifts the previous contents of the barrel upwards.  When the rods begin pushing down, the traveling valve opens and the standing valve closes (due to an increase in pressure in the pump barrel).  The traveling valve drops through the fluid in the barrel (which had been sucked in during the upstroke).  The piston then reaches the end of its stroke and begins its path upwards again, repeating the process.

Often, gas is produced through the same perforations as the oil. This can be problematic if gas enters the pump, because it can result in what is known as gas locking, where insufficient pressure builds up in the pump barrel to open the valves (due to compression of the gas) and little or nothing is pumped. To preclude this, the inlet for the pump can be placed below the perforations. As the gas-laden fluid enters the well bore through the perforations, the gas bubbles up the annulus (the space between the casing and the tubing) while the liquid moves down to the standing valve inlet. Once at the surface, the gas is collected through piping connected to the annulus.

==Water well pumpjacks==
Pumpjacks can also be used to drive what would now be considered old-fashioned hand-pumped water wells. The scale of the technology is frequently smaller than for an oil well, and can typically fit on top of an existing hand-pumped well head. The technology is simple, typically using a parallel-bar double-cam lift driven from a low-power electric motor, although the number of pumpjacks with stroke lengths 54 inches (137&amp;nbsp;cm) and longer being used as water pumps is increasing. A short video recording of such a pump in action can be viewed on YouTube.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube | id=2lkoCCCQytc | title=Pumping unit}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the flow rate for a water well pumpjack is lower than that from a jet pump and the lifted water is not pressurised, the beam pumping unit has the option of hand pumping in an emergency, by hand-rotating the pumpjack cam to its lowest position, and attaching a manual handle to the top of the wellhead rod. In larger pumpjacks powered by engines, the engine can run off fuel stored in a reservoir or from natural gas delivered from the nearest [[Pipeline transport|gas grid]]. In some cases, this type of pump consumes less power than a jet pump and is, therefore, cheaper to run.

{{Refimprove|date=October 2008}}
'''Rainmaking''', also known as '''artificial precipitation, artificial rainfall and pluviculture''', is the act of attempting to artificially induce or increase [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]], usually to stave off [[drought]]. According to the clouds' different physical properties, this can be done using airplanes or rockets to sow to the clouds with catalysts such as [[dry ice]], [[silver iodide]] and salt powder, to make clouds rain or increase precipitation, to remove or mitigate farmland [[drought]], to increase reservoir irrigation water or water supply capacity, or to increase water levels for power generation. 

In the United States, rainmaking was attempted by traveling showmen. It was practiced in the [[American Old West|old west]], but may have reached a peak during the [[dust bowl]] drought of the American West and Midwest in the 1930s.  The practice was depicted in the 1956 film ''[[The Rainmaker (1956 film)|The Rainmaker]]''.  Attempts to bring rain directly have waned with development of the science of [[meteorology]], the advent of laws against fraud and increased communication technology, with some exceptions such as [[cloud seeding]] and forms of [[prayer]] including [[rain dance]]s, which are still practiced today. Prayer for more rain is also a cultural practice for Christians and Muslims in areas which people keep "traditional" non-scriptural religions.{{cn|date=November 2012}} In the Christian areas the Defteras (learned clerics of the Orthodox Christian Church) believed to have the wisdom to arrest the rain, to bring hail to farms of individuals who refuse to comply with religious rules as well as to bring more rains when the rainy season fell short of giving the usual amount of rain needed for growing cereals. {{cn|date=November 2012}}

The term is also used metaphorically to describe the process of bringing new clients into a professional practice, such as law, architecture, consulting, advertising, or investment banking—in general, processes that bring [[money]] into a [[company]].

It is also used to describe a [[confidence trick]] where the scammer takes money from the victim to influence a system over which they have no real control, but a random chance of the outcome happening anyway.

==Cloud seeding==

Since the 1940s, [[cloud seeding]] has been used to change the structure of clouds by dispersing substances into the air, potentially increasing or altering rainfall.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation
 | first1=Arnett S. | last1=Dennis
 | title=Weather Modification by Cloud Seeding
 | series=International Geophysics
 | page=2–3 | volume=24 | year=1980 | postscript=.
 | publisher=Academic Press | isbn=0080954588
 | publication-place=New York

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of experiments dating back to at least the start of the 20th century, however, there is much controversy surrounding the efficacy of cloud seeding, and evidence that cloud seeding leads to increased precipitation on the ground is highly equivocal. One difficulty is knowing how much precipitation might have fallen had any particular cloud not been seeded.  [[Operation Popeye]] was a US military rainmaking operation to increase rains over [[Vietnam]] during the [[Vietnam War]] in order to slow Vietnamese military truck activity in the region. Rainmaking is not [[climate engineering]], which seeks to alter climate, but a form of [[weather modification]], as it seeks only to change local weather.

==Wilhelm Reich's Cloudbuster==
Austrian-American psychoanalyst [[Wilhelm Reich]] designed a "[[cloudbuster]]" in the [[United States]] with which he said he could manipulate streams of "[[Orgone|orgone energy]]" (which he claimed was a primordial cosmic energy) in the atmosphere to induce rain by forcing clouds to form and disperse. It was a set of hollow metal pipes and cables inserted into water, which Reich argued created a stronger orgone energy field than was in the atmosphere, the water drawing the atmospheric orgone through the pipes. Reich called his research "Cosmic Orgone Engineering".

==Rain dances and prayer==

In many societies around the world, [[rain dance]]s and other rituals have been used to attempt to increase rainfall.  Some [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] used rain dances extensively.  European examples include the [[Romania]]n ceremonies known as [[paparuda]] and [[caloian]]. Some [[United States]] [[farmer]]s also attempt to bring rain during droughts through prayer. These rituals differ greatly in their specifics, but share a common concern with bringing rain through ritual and/or spiritual means. Typical of these ceremonies was then-governor of Georgia [[Sonny Perdue]]'s public prayer service for rain, in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wdef.com/news/governor_sonny_perdue_prays_for_rain_in_georgia/11/2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary Jewish liturgy includes prayers for rain, seasonally, as a part of the morning, afernoon, and evening, daily [[Amidah#Prayers_for_rain_in_winter_and_dew_in_summer|amidah]] prayer, during mid-Autumn to mid-Spring. During Summer, this prayer is changed from the prayer for rain, to a prayer for dew.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5741">A '''scotophor''' is a material showing reversible darkening and bleaching when subjected to certain types of radiation. The name means ''dark bearer'', in contrast to [[phosphor]], which means ''light bearer''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=wOt9IBunyrkC&amp;pg=PA770&amp;dq=%22Scotophor%22&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Scotophor%22&amp;f=false |title=Principles of digital image synthesis|volume=1|page=770|author=Andrew S. Glassner |publisher=Morgan Kaufmann|date= 1995|isbn=1-55860-276-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scotophors show [[tenebrescence]] (reversible [[photochromism]]) and darken when subjected to an intense radiation such as [[sunlight]]. [[Mineral]]s showing such behavior include [[sodalite|hackmanite sodalite]], [[spodumene]] and [[tugtupite]]. Some pure [[alkali halide]]s also show such behavior.

Scotophors can be sensitive to [[light]], [[particle radiation]] (e.g. [[electron beam]] – see [[cathodochromism]]), [[X-ray]]s, or other stimuli. The induced [[absorption band]]s in the material, caused by [[F-center]]s created by electron bombardment, can be returned to their non-absorbing state, usually by light and/or heating.

Scotophors sensitive to [[electron beam]] radiation can be used instead of [[phosphor]]s in [[cathode ray tube]]s, for creating a light absorbing instead of light emitting image. Such displays are viewable in bright light and the image is persistent, until erased.

The image would be retained until erased by flooding the scotophor with a high-intensity [[infrared light]] or by electro-thermal heating. Using conventional deflection and [[raster scan|raster]] formation circuity, a bi-level image could be created on the membrane and retained even when power was removed from the CRT.

In Germany, scotophor tubes were developed by [[Telefunken]] as '''blauschrift-röhre''' ("dark-trace tube"). The heating mechanism was a layer of [[mica]] with transparent [[thin film]] of [[tungsten]]. When the image was to be erased, current was applied to the tungsten layer; even very dark images could be erased in 5–10 seconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cdvandt.org/blauschrift-roehre.htm |title=Blauschrift-Roehre |publisher=Cdvandt.org |date= |accessdate=2010-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scotophors typically require a higher-intensity electron beam to change color than phosphors need to emit light. Screens with layers of a scotophor and a phosphor are therefore possible, where the phosphor, flooded with a dedicated wide-beam low-intensity [[electron gun]], produces [[backlight]] for the scotophor, and optionally highlights selected areas of the screen if bombarded with electrons with higher energy but still insufficient to penetrate the phosphor and change the scotophor state.&lt;ref name=p1/&gt;

The main application of scotophors was in [[plan position indicator]]s, specialized military [[radar]] displays. The achievable brightness allowed projecting the image to a larger surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://histru.bournemouth.ac.uk/Oral_History/Talking_About_Technology/radar_research/the_skiatron.html |title=The Skiatron |publisher=Histru.bournemouth.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ability to quickly record a persistent trace found its use in some [[oscilloscope]]s.

==Materials==
[[Potassium chloride]] is used as a scotophor with designation '''P10''' in dark-trace CRTs (also called ''dark trace tubes'', ''color center tubes'', ''cathodochromic displays'' or ''scotophor tubes''), e.g. in the [[Skiatron]]. This [[cathode ray tube|CRT]] replaced the conventional light-emitting ''[[phosphor]]'' layer on the face of the tube screen with a ''scotophor'' such as potassium chloride (KCl). Potassium chloride has the property that when a crystal is struck by an [[electron beam]], that spot would change from translucent white to a dark [[magenta]] color.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} By [[backlight]]ing such a CRT with a white or green circular [[fluorescent lamp]], the resulting image would appear as black information against a green background or as magenta information against a white background. A benefit, aside from the semi-permanent storage of the displayed image, is that the brightness of the resultant display is only limited by the illumination source and optics. The F-centers, however, have tendency to aggregate, and the screen needs to be heated to fully erase the image.

The image on KCl can be formed by depositing a charge of over 0.3 micro[[coulomb]] per square centimeter, by an electron beam with energy typically at 8–10 keV. The erasure can be achieved in less than a second by heating the scotophor at 150&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name=p1&gt;Hamann {{US patent|3560782}} Cathode ray tube with phosphor and scatophor {{sic}} layers in screen (1968)&lt;/ref&gt;

KCl was the most common scotophor used. Other [[halide]]s show the same property; [[potassium bromide]] absorbs in bluish end of the spectrum, resulting in a brown trace, [[sodium chloride]] produces a trace that is colored more towards orange.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cdvandt.org/Blauschrift-Roehre.pdf The skiatron or dark trace tube and its applications]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another scotophor used in dark-trace CRTs is a modified [[sodalite]], fired in reducing atmosphere or having some chlorides substituted with sulfate ions. Its advantage against KCl is its higher writing speed, less fatigue, and the F-centers do not aggregate, therefore it is possible to substantially erase the screen with light only, without heating.&lt;ref&gt;Takeshi Takeda et al. {{US patent|4069440}} Recording material (1956)&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[supersymmetry|supersymmetric]] extension to the [[Standard Model]] of [[physics]], a '''sfermion''' is a hypothetical  [[spin (physics)|spin]]-0 [[superpartner|superpartner particle]] (sparticle) of its associated [[fermion]].  Each particle has a superpartner with spin that differs by {{sfrac|1|2}}. Fermions in the SM have [[spin-1/2|spin-{{sfrac|1|2}}]] and therefore sfermions have spin 0.

The name 'sfermion' was formed by the general rule of prefixing an 's' to the name of its superpartner, denoting that it is a [[Scalar boson|'''s'''calar particle]] with spin 0. For instance, the [[electron]]'s superpartner is the [[selectron (particle)|selectron]] and the [[top quark]]'s superpartner is the [[stop squark]].

One corollary from supersymmetry is that sparticles have the same [[gauge theory|gauge number]]s as their SM partners. This means that sparticle&amp;ndash;particle pairs have the same [[color charge]], [[weak isospin]] charge, and [[hypercharge]] (and consequently [[electric charge]]). Unbroken supersymmetry also implies that sparticle&amp;ndash;particle pairs have the same mass. This is evidently not the case, since these sparticles would have already been detected. Thus, sparticles must have different masses from the particle partners and supersymmetry is said to be broken.

[[Image:High angle.jpg|right|thumb|A slurry composed of glass beads in [[silicone oil]] flowing down an inclined plane]]
A '''slurry''' is a thin and viscous fluid [[mixture]] composed of a pulverized solid and a liquid. Slurries flow under gravity, can be [[pump]]ed if not too thick, and are often used as a convenient way of handling solids in bulk.&lt;ref&gt;Oxford English Dictionary 2nd ed.: Slurry&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Examples==
Examples of slurries include:
* Cement slurry, a mixture of [[cement]], water, and assorted dry and liquid additives used in the [[Petroleum industry|petroleum]] and other industries&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.glossary.oilfield.slb.com/Display.cfm?Term=cement Shlumberger: Oilfield glossary]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rheonova.fr/en/chemistry Rheonova : Measuring rheological propertis of settling slurries]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Soil/cement slurry, also called Controlled Low-Strength Material (CLSM), flowable fill, controlled               density fill, flowable mortar, plastic soil-cement,  K-Krete, and other names&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cement.org/basics/concreteproducts_clsm.asp Portland Cement Association: Controlled Low-Strength Material]&lt;/ref&gt;
* A mixture of [[thickening agent#weapon use|thickening agent]], oxidizers, and water used to form a [[Water gel explosive|gel explosive]]{{Citation needed|date=May 2012|reason=is this called a slurry?}}

==Calculations==

===Determining solids fraction===
To determine the percent solids (or solids fraction) of a slurry from the density of the slurry, solids and liquid&lt;ref&gt;Wills, B.A. and Napier-Munn, T.J, ''Wills' Mineral Processing Technology: an introduction to the practical aspects of ore treatment and mineral recovery, {{ISBN|978-0-7506-4450-1}}'', Seventh Edition (2006), Elsevier, Great Britain&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\phi_{sl}=\frac{\rho_{s}(\rho_{sl} - \rho_{l})}{\rho_{sl}(\rho_{s} - \rho_{l})}&lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;\phi_{sl}&lt;/math&gt; is the solids fraction of the slurry (state by mass)
:&lt;math&gt;\rho_{s}&lt;/math&gt;  is the solids density
:&lt;math&gt;\rho_{sl}&lt;/math&gt;  is the slurry density
:&lt;math&gt;\rho_{l}&lt;/math&gt;  is the liquid density

In aqueous slurries, as is common in mineral processing, the specific gravity of the species is typically used, and since &lt;math&gt;SG_{water}&lt;/math&gt; is taken to be 1, this relation is typically written:
:&lt;math&gt;\phi_{sl}=\frac{\rho_{s}(\rho_{sl} - 1)}{\rho_{sl}(\rho_{s} - 1)}&lt;/math&gt;
even though specific gravity with units tonnes/m^3 (t/m^3) is used instead of the SI density unit, kg/m^3.

===Liquid mass from mass fraction of solids===
To determine the mass of liquid in a sample given the mass of solids and the mass fraction:
By definition
:&lt;math&gt;\phi_{sl}=\frac{M_{s}}{M_{sl}}&lt;/math&gt;
therefore
:&lt;math&gt;M_{sl}=\frac{M_{s}}{\phi_{sl}}&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;M_{s}+M_{l}=\frac{M_{s}}{\phi_{sl}}&lt;/math&gt;
then
:&lt;math&gt;M_{l}=\frac{M_{s}}{\phi_{sl}}-M_{s}&lt;/math&gt;
and therefore
:&lt;math&gt;M_{l}=\frac{1-\phi_{sl}}{\phi_{sl}}M_{s}&lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;\phi_{sl}&lt;/math&gt; is the solids fraction of the slurry
:&lt;math&gt;M_{s}&lt;/math&gt; is the mass or mass flow of solids in the sample or stream
:&lt;math&gt;M_{sl}&lt;/math&gt; is the mass or mass flow of slurry in the sample or stream
:&lt;math&gt;M_{l}&lt;/math&gt; is the mass or mass flow of liquid in the sample or stream

===Volumetric fraction from mass fraction===
:&lt;math&gt;\phi_{sl,m}=\frac{M_{s}}{M_{sl}}&lt;/math&gt;
Equivalently
:&lt;math&gt;\phi_{sl,v}=\frac{V_{s}}{V_{sl}}&lt;/math&gt;
and in a minerals processing context where the specific gravity of the liquid (water) is taken to be one:
:&lt;math&gt;\phi_{sl,v}=\frac{\frac{M_{s}}{SG_{s}}}{\frac{M_{s}}{SG_{s}}+\frac{M_{l}}{1}}&lt;/math&gt;
So
:&lt;math&gt;\phi_{sl,v}=\frac{M_{s}}{M_{s}+M_{l}SG_{s}}&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;\phi_{sl,v}=\frac{1}{1+\frac{M_{l}SG_{s}}{M_{s}}}&lt;/math&gt;
Then combining with the first equation:
:&lt;math&gt;\phi_{sl,v}=\frac{1}{1+\frac{M_{l}SG_{s}}{\phi_{sl,m}M_{s}}\frac{M_{s}}{M_{s}+M_{l}}}&lt;/math&gt;
So
:&lt;math&gt;\phi_{sl,v}=\frac{1}{1+\frac{SG_{s}}{\phi_{sl,m}}\frac{M_{l}}{M_{s}+M_{l}}}&lt;/math&gt;
Then since
:&lt;math&gt;\phi_{sl,m}=\frac{M_{s}}{M_{s}+M_{l}}=1-\frac{M_{l}}{M_{s}+M_{l}}&lt;/math&gt;
we conclude that
:&lt;math&gt;\phi_{sl,v}=\frac{1}{1+SG_{s}(\frac{1}{\phi_{sl,m}}-1)}&lt;/math&gt;

where
:&lt;math&gt;\phi_{sl,v}&lt;/math&gt; is the solids fraction of the slurry on a ''volumetric'' basis
:&lt;math&gt;\phi_{sl,m}&lt;/math&gt; is the solids fraction of the slurry on a ''mass'' basis
:&lt;math&gt;M_{s}&lt;/math&gt; is the mass or mass flow of solids in the sample or stream
:&lt;math&gt;M_{sl}&lt;/math&gt; is the mass or mass flow of slurry in the sample or stream
:&lt;math&gt;M_{l}&lt;/math&gt; is the mass or mass flow of liquid in the sample or stream komi
:&lt;math&gt;SG_{s}&lt;/math&gt; is the bulk specific gravity of the solids

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3285">[[File:TmutarakanskyKamen.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Stone of Tmutarakan]]
'''The Stone of Tmutarakan''' ({{lang-ru|Тмутараканский камень}}) is a marble slab engraved with the words "In the year 6576 [ [[Etos Kosmou|A.M.]], 1068 A.D] the sixth of the [[Indiction]], Prince Gleb measured across the sea on the ice from [[Tmutarakan]] to [[Kerch]] 14,000 sazhen" («В лето 6576 индикта 6 Глеб князь мерил море по леду от Тмутороканя до Корчева 14000 сажен»).

A [[sazhen]], an old [[Kievan Rus'|Rus]] unit of length, was equal to seven feet (or corresponded roughly to a [[fathom]]); thus the [[Kerch Straits]], according to the stone, were 88,000 feet or 18.5 miles across (that is, from Kerch to [[Tmutarakan]] — the straits themselves are only 4.5 miles wide at their narrowest point, but the distance from the site of Tmutarakan to modern-day Kerch is about 15 miles.)  The tenth-century [[Byzantine]] Emperor [[Constantine Porphyrogenitus]] wrote that the straits were the equivalent of 18 miles across,&lt;ref&gt;Brian J. Boeck, "Stone of Contention: Medieval Tmutarakan as a Measure of Soviet Archaeology in the 1950s and 1960s," ''Ruthenica'' 4 (2005), p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; and this might explain why that measurement appears on the stone, although it is unclear if an eleventh-century prince in Rus would have had access to that information; this uncertainty calls the stone's authenticity into question.

The Prince Gleb referred to in the inscription was [[Gleb Svyatoslavich]], then prince of [[Tmutarakan]].  Gleb was later Prince of [[Novgorod the Great]], where he saved Bishop Fedor's life by chopping a sorcerer in half who led a pagan uprising against the bishop.  Gleb was eventually killed fighting pagan Finnic tribes in the northern Novgorodian Lands ("the Zavoloch'e" or "Za Volokom", "the Land beyond the Portages") on May 30, 1079.&lt;ref&gt;А. N. Nasonov, ed., ''Novgorodskaia Pervaia Letopis Starshego i Mladshego Izvodov'' (Moscow and Leningrad: AN SSSR, 1950), 18, 201; Janet Martin, ''Medieval Russia 980-1584'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1995), 44.&lt;/ref&gt;

The stone was discovered on the [[Taman Peninsula]] just east of [[Crimea]] in 1792 and the inscription was first published in 1794 by [[Aleksei Musin-Pushkin]].  The study of the inscription is said to be the first [[epigraphic]] study in Russian history.   In spite of its importance in the history of Russian epigraphy, a number of scholars have called the stone's provenance into question and consider the stone an eighteenth-century forgery, perhaps done by Romanticists enamored of ancient culture or even as an effort to find precedent for Russian involvement in the [[Caucasus]].&lt;ref&gt;See Boeck, "Stone of Contention," 33, 38-9; Idem, Minnesota and. Kievan Rus," ''Russian History'' 32, 3-4: V. A. Zakharov, "Zametki o Tmutarakanskom Kamene," in ''SRIO'', 2002, 4 (152), pp. 154-178.&lt;/ref&gt;  The stone is currently housed in the [[State Hermitage Museum]] in [[Saint Petersburg]].

A '''thickening agent''' or '''thickener '''is a [[chemical substance|substance]] which can increase the [[viscosity]] of a [[liquid]] without substantially changing its other properties. Edible thickeners are commonly used to thicken [[sauce]]s, [[soup]]s, and [[pudding]]s without altering their taste; thickeners are also used in [[paint]]s, [[ink]]s, [[explosive]]s, and [[cosmetics]].

Thickeners may also improve the [[suspension (chemistry)|suspension]] of other ingredients or [[emulsion]]s which increases the stability of the product. Thickening agents are often regulated as [[food additive]]s and as [[cosmetics]] and [[personal hygiene product]] ingredients. Some thickening agents are '''gelling agents''' ('''gellants'''), forming a [[gel]], dissolving in the liquid phase as a [[colloid]] mixture that forms a weakly cohesive internal structure. Others act as mechanical [[thixotropy|thixotropic]] additives with discrete particles adhering or interlocking to resist [[Deformation (mechanics)|strain]].

Thickening agents can also be used when a medical condition such as [[dysphagia]] causes difficulty in swallowing.  Thickened liquids play a vital role in reducing risk of [[Pulmonary aspiration|aspiration]] for dysphagia patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |first1=Devon L. |last1=Glassburn |first2= Jodelle F. |last2=Deem |title=Thickener Viscosity in Dysphagia Management: Variability among Speech-Language Pathologists |journal=Dysphagia |year=1998 |volume=13 |issue=4 |pages=218–222 |doi=10.1007/PL00009575 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Food==
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2014}}
Food thickeners frequently are based on either [[polysaccharide]]s ([[starch]]es, [[vegetable gum]]s, and [[pectin]]), or [[protein]]s. A flavorless powdered [[starch]] used for this purpose is a '''fecula''' (from the Latin ''faecula'', diminutive of ''faex,'' "dregs"). This category includes starches as [[arrowroot]], [[cornstarch]], [[Erythronium japonicum|katakuri starch]], [[potato starch]], [[sago]], [[tapioca]] and their [[modified starch|starch derivatives]]. Microbial and [[Vegetable gum]]s used as food thickeners include [[Alginic acid|alginin]], [[guar gum]], [[locust bean gum]], and [[xanthan gum]].  Proteins used as food thickeners include [[collagen]], [[egg white]]s, and [[gelatin]].  [[Polysaccharide|Sugar polymers]] include [[agar]], [[carboxymethyl cellulose]], [[pectin]] and [[carrageenan]]. Other thickening agents act on the proteins already present in a food. One example is [[sodium pyrophosphate]], which acts on [[casein]] in milk during the preparation of [[instant pudding]].

Different thickeners may be more or less suitable in a given application, due to differences in taste, clarity, and their responses to chemical and physical conditions. For example, for acidic foods, [[arrowroot]] is a better choice than [[cornstarch]], which loses thickening potency in acidic mixtures. At (acidic) pH levels below 4.5, guar gum has sharply reduced aqueous solubility, thus also reducing its thickening capability. If the food is to be frozen, tapioca or arrowroot are preferable over cornstarch, which becomes spongy when frozen.

Many other food ingredients are used as thickeners, usually in the final stages of preparation of specific foods. These thickeners have a flavor and are not markedly stable, thus are not suitable for general use.  However, they are very convenient and effective, and hence are widely used.

Functional [[flour]]s are produced from specific cereal variety ([[wheat]], [[maize]], [[rice]] or other) conjugated to specific heat treatment able to increase stability, consistency and general functionalities. These functional flours are resistant to industrial stresses such as acidic pH, sterilisation, freeze conditions, and can help food industries to formulate with [[natural foods|natural ingredients]]. For the final consumer, these ingredients are more accepted because they are shown as "flour" in the ingredient list.

Flour is often used for thickening [[gravy|gravies]], [[gumbo]]s, and [[stew]]s. It must be cooked in thoroughly to avoid the taste of uncooked flour. [[Roux]], a mixture of flour and fat (usually butter) cooked into a paste, is used for gravies, [[sauce]]s and stews. Cereal grains ([[oatmeal]], [[couscous]], [[farina (food)|farina]], etc.) are used to thicken [[soup]]s. [[Yogurt]] is popular in Eastern Europe and Middle East for thickening soups. Soups can also be thickened by adding grated starchy vegetables before cooking, though these will add their own flavour. Tomato puree also adds thickness as well as flavour. [[Egg yolk]]s are a traditional sauce thickener in professional cooking; they have rich flavor and offer a velvety smooth texture but achieve the desired thickening effect only in a narrow temperature range. Overheating easily ruins such a sauce, which can make egg yolk difficult to use as a thickener for amateur cooks.  Other thickeners used by cooks are [[nut (fruit)|nuts]] (including [[Ocimum tenuiflorum|rehan]]) or [[demi-glace|glaces]] made of [[meat]] or [[Fish (food)|fish]].

Many thickening agents require extra care in cooking. Some starches lose their thickening quality when cooked for too long or at too high a temperature; on the other hand, cooking starches too short or not hot enough might lead to an unpleasant starchy taste or cause water to seep out of the finished product after cooling. Also, higher viscosity causes foods to burn more easily during cooking. As an alternative to adding more thickener, recipes may call for reduction of the food's water content by lengthy [[simmering]]. When cooking, it is generally better to add thickener cautiously; if over-thickened, more water may be added but loss of flavour and texture may result.

Gelling agents are [[food additive]]s used to thicken and stabilize various foods, like [[Gelatin dessert|jellies]], [[dessert]]s and [[candy|candies]]. The agents provide the foods with texture through formation of a [[gel]]. Some [[Stabilizer (food)|stabilizer]]s and thickening agents are gelling agents.

Typical gelling agents include [[natural gum]]s, [[starch]]es, [[pectin]]s, [[agar-agar]] and [[gelatin]]. Often they are based on polysaccharides or proteins.

Examples are:
* [[Alginic acid]] (E400), [[sodium alginate]] (E401), [[potassium alginate]] (E402), [[ammonium alginate]] (E403), [[calcium alginate]] (E404) - polysaccharides from [[brown alga]]e
* [[Agar]] (E406, a polysaccharide obtained from red [[algae]])
* [[Carrageenan]] (E407, a polysaccharide obtained from red [[seaweed]]s)
* [[Locust bean gum]] (E410, a [[natural gum]] polysaccharide from the seeds of the carob tree)
* [[Pectin]] (E440, a polysaccharide obtained from apple or citrus-fruit)
* [[Gelatin]] (E441, made by partial hydrolysis of animal [[collagen]])

Commercial jellies used in East [[Asian cuisine]]s include the [[glucomannan]] polysaccharide gum used to make "lychee cups" from the [[konjac]] plants, and [[Aiyu jelly|aiyu or ice jelly]] from the ''[[Ficus pumila var. awkeotsang|Ficus pumila]]'' climbing fig plant.

Food thickening can be important for people facing medical issues with [[chewing]] or [[swallowing]], as foods with a thicker consistency can reduce the chances of [[choking]], or of inhalation of liquids or food particles, which can lead to [[aspiration pneumonia]].

==Mechanical and thixotropic agents==
[[Fumed silica]] and similar products form stiff microscopic chains or fibers which interlock or agglomerate into a mass, holding the associated liquid by [[surface tension]], but which can separate or slide when sufficient force is applied.  This causes the [[thixotropic]] or shear-thinning property (also frequently exhibited by gels), where the viscosity is [[non-newtonian]] and becomes lower as the shearing force or time increases; their usefulness is primarily that the resulting increase in viscosity is large compared to the quantity of silica added. Fumed silica is [[GRAS|generally accepted as safe]] as a food additive&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cabotcorp.com/modals/documentation-download/?type=msds&amp;prodCode=TS530|title= Fumed Silica MSDS|publisher= Cabot Corporation|accessdate= 20 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is frequently used in cosmetics.   Additives such as [[precipitated silica]], fine [[talc]], or [[chalk]] also meet the definition of ''thickening agent'' in that they increase viscosity and body while not affecting the target property of a mixture.{{fact|date=December 2016}}

==Cosmetics==
Thickening agents used in cosmetics or personal hygiene products include viscous liquids such as [[polyethylene glycol]], synthetic polymers such as [[carbomer]] (a trade name for [[polyacrylic acid]]) and [[vegetable gum]]s.  Some thickening agents may also function as [[Stabilizer (chemistry)|stabilizers]] when they are used to maintain the stability of an [[emulsion]].  Some [[emollient]]s, such as [[petroleum jelly]] and various [[wax]]es may also function as thickening agents in an emulsion.{{fact|date=December 2016}}

==Paint and printing thickeners==

One of the main use of thickeners is in the paint and printing industries, which depend heavily on [[rheology]] modifiers, to prevent pigments settling to the bottom of the can, yielding inconsistent results. Water based formulas would be nearly impossible with the exception of [[India ink]] and the few other water-soluble pigments, but these would have very little coverage and at best would stain wood slightly. All modern paints and inks will have some pigment added at the factory for opacity and to control the specularity of the finish, from matte to high gloss, dependent on thickener used, but more so on the size of the particles added as opacity modifier. One-[[micrometer]] (µm) particle sizes and below will be the limit of high gloss, probably confined to luxury automotive coatings, and about 100&amp;nbsp;µm particulates will make a bumpy surface on the microscopic scale, which scatters light and makes the surface appear matte.{{fact|date=December 2016}}

Rheology modifiers in common use:
* [[Polyurethane]]s, acrylic polymers, latex, [[styrene]]/[[butadiene]], 
* PVA -  [[polyvinyl alcohol]], not polyvinylacetate which is used in adhesives such as wood glue. PVA monomers are dispersed in the paint or ink liquid at an early stage in the mix, as it does not affect rheology unless the pH is low. Boric acid is usually used to initiate polymerization after the pigment is added (the pigment "grind" stage) and dispersed, the mixture is thickened while stirring to maintain homogeneous consistency. Often this stage is problematic since air is entrained by all but the lowest shear impellers, which are inadequate for this purpose, instead antifoam additives are used to control air bubbles, which continue to be a benefit during paint application. Air entrainment during mixing is not unique to PVA—in fact hardly a formula for paint exists that doesn't at least require some care in mixing. 
* Clays - attapulgite which also disperses suspensions, bentonite (both flocculating and non-flocculating), and other montmorillonite clays. Usually clays, when dry, exist as a very fine powder, facilitating dispersion and compatibility with other ingredients. Clays generally make matte surfaces, in spite of their fine particulate nature. Not only paints and inks, but other industries such as pharmaceutical, construction, and cosmetics, especially hair styling aids and facial detoxifying masks increasingly favor bentonite and attapulgite clays over other rheology modifiers, dispersion aids, opacifying fillers, antifoam, and numerous niche uses which exploit the numerous inherent qualities which have drawn artisans to this material. Clays are sustainably sourced and do not involve any egregious environmental damage, which were among the cheapest bulk materials until recently, when the pricing went up steadily, following the upsurge in its use pattern.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}
* Cellulosics - CMC, HMC, HPMC, and others, all are chemically substituted cellulose macromolecules. The hydroxyl groups are what gets substituted by other functional groups, such as methoxy or propyl. The amount of substitution and molecular weight determine viscosity of the solution, assuming concentration stays the same; adding more also increases viscosity.
* Sulfonates - Sodium or calcium salts, good water retention, versatile, and highly efficient.
* Gums - guar, xanthan, cellulose, locust bean, and acacia are the main ones.
* Saccharides - carrageenan, pullulan, konjac, and alginate, sometimes called hydrocolloids, these thickeners are extremely versatile and specific in function—each has a series of grades or types which behave differently, for example kappa carrageenan will form strong gels(potassium activated) but iota carrageenan will not form gels and only thickens.
* Proteins - Casein, collagen,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://finance.yahoo.com/news/perfect-hydrolyzed-collagen-named-best-173500454.html|title=Hydrolyzed Collagen|publisher=Yahoo|accessdate=19 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sometimes albumin. 
* Modified castor oil - much like cellulose, castor oil has hydroxyl groups, unlike other oils which at most have double bonds, which castor oil also has, but most substitutions occur at the hydroxyl moieties, allowing exotic derivatives with myriad properties. The most recent advances in rheology modifiers have been in this category. The BASF corporation has a new line based on castor oil derivatives, for example.
* Organosilicones - Silicone resins, dimethicones, and modified silicones simplify formulation somewhat, a borrowing from cosmetics.

All of the above rheology modifiers are used in the 0.2% to 2.0% range

==Petrochemistry==
In petrochemistry, gelling agents, also called '''solidifiers''', are chemicals capable of reacting with [[oil spill]]s and forming rubber-like solids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Jadhav |first=S. R. |last2=Vemula |first2=P. K. |last3=Kumar |first3=R. |last4=Raghavan |first4=S. R. |last5=John |first5=G. |year=2010 |title=Sugar-Derived Phase-Selective Molecular Gelators as Model Solidifiers for Oil Spills |journal=Angew. Chem. |volume=122 |issue= |pages=7861–7864 |doi=10.1002/ange.201002095 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The gelled coagulated oil then can be removed from the water surface by skimming, suction devices, or nets. Calm or only moderately rough sea is required.

==Explosives and incendiaries==
Various materials are used to convert [[liquid explosive]]s to a gel form. [[Nitrocellulose]] and other [[nitrate|nitro esters]] are often used. Other possibilities include nitrated [[guar gum]].

Many fuels used in [[incendiary device]]s require thickening for increased performance. Aluminium salts of [[fatty acid]]s are frequently used. Some formulations (e.g. [[Napalm]]-B) use polymeric thickeners, namely [[polystyrene]]. [[Hydroxyl aluminium bis(2-ethylhexanoate)]] is also used. [[Thickened pyrophoric agent]], a [[pyrophoric]] replacement of napalm, is a [[triethylaluminium]] thickened with [[polyisobutylene]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7068">'''Valleytronics''' is a ''[[portmanteau]]'' combining the terms ''valley'' and ''electronics''. Certain [[semiconductor]]s present multiple "valleys"{{clarification needed|date=September 2018}} in the first [[Brillouin zone]], and are known as multivalley semiconductors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Behnia|first=Kamran|date=2012-07-01|title=Polarized light boosts valleytronics|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/nnano.2012.117|journal=Nature Nanotechnology|language=En|volume=7|issue=8|pages=488–489|doi=10.1038/nnano.2012.117|issn=1748-3387|bibcode=2012NatNa...7..488B}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nebel|first=Christoph E.|date=2013|title=Electrons dance in diamond|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/nmat3724|journal=Nature Materials|language=|volume=12|issue=8|pages=690–691|doi=10.1038/nmat3724|issn=1476-1122|via=|bibcode=2013NatMa..12..690N}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term refers to the technology of control over the valley degree of freedom, a [[local optimum|local maximum/minimum]] on the [[valence band|valence]]/[[conduction band]], of such multivalley semiconductors. 

The term was coined in analogy to the blooming field of [[spintronics]]. While in spintronics the internal degree of freedom of [[spin (physics)|spin]] is harnessed to store, manipulate and read out bits of information, the proposal for valleytronics is to perform similar tasks using the multiple extrema of the band structure, so that the information of 0s and 1s would be stored as different discrete values of the [[crystal momentum]].

The term is often used as an [[umbrella term]] to other forms of quantum manipulation of valleys in semiconductors, including [[quantum computation]] with valley-based [[qubits]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Gunawan|first = O.|last2 = Habib|first2 = B.|last3 = De Poortere|first3 = E.

'''Veti-gel''' is a [[veterinary]] product, a plant-derived injectable [[gel]] that is claimed to quickly stop traumatic bleeding on external and internal wounds.  Its name is coined from Medi-Gel, from the video game series [[Mass Effect]]. It uses  a plant-based haemophilic [[polymer]] made from [[polysaccharides]] that  forms a [[mesh]] which seals  the [[wound]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/vetigel-plant-based-gel-that-stops-traumatic-bleeding-wounds-15-seconds-1476464|title=Vetigel: The Plant-Based Gel That Stops Traumatic Bleeding Wounds in 15 Seconds|work=International Business Times UK|accessdate=30 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is manufactured by Suneris Inc, an American [[biotechnology]] company, which is also exploring human products derived from its technology, slated to launch as early as 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/innovation/plant-based-gel-stops-bleeding-seconds-180953488/?no-ist|title=This Plant-Based Gel Stops Bleeding in Seconds|author=Matt Safford|work=Smithsonian|accessdate=30 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company plans on releasing a product for the [[US Military|military]] and the [[emergency medicine]] market first, followed by a product for the [[surgery|human surgical]] market when FDA approval is granted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fastcoexist.com/3034403/a-gel-that-can-stop-bleeding-in-under-10-seconds-gets-closer-to-human-use|title=A Gel That Can Stop Bleeding In Under 10 Seconds Gets Closer To Human Use|work=Co.Exist|accessdate=30 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2462">In [[power engineering]], '''winding factor''' is a technique that is employed to improve the [[root mean square|rms]] generated voltage or [[electromotive force]] (EMF) in a three-phase AC [[electrical machine]] so that the output voltage and hence torque does not have any harmonics in it which may reduce  efficiency. This is because the [[Armature (electrical engineering)|armature]] winding of each phase is distributed in a number of slots. Since the EMF induced in different slots are not in phase, their phasor sum is less than their numerical sum. This reduction factor is called distribution factor K&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;. Another factor that can reduce the '''winding factor''' is when the slot pitch is smaller than the pole pitch, called pitch factor K&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;. 

The '''winding factor''' can be calculated as &lt;br /&gt;
K&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt; = K&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; * K&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

To calculate the winding factor,  &lt;br /&gt;
K&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;=K&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; X K&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;      ----(1) &lt;br /&gt;
Where &lt;br /&gt;
K&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;=~1 (point here to keep in mind is that all(three phase) motors are balanced systems. &lt;br /&gt;
K&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;=Cos(a/2)            ----(2) &lt;br /&gt;
where a is the value of by which the coil is short-pitched &lt;br /&gt;

To calculate a, one needs to know and hence calculate the [[coil pitch]] and [[pole pitch]] of the motor. &lt;br /&gt;

Coil pitch is 2pi/number of slots. It needs to be in [[electrical degrees]] so the answer has to be divided by 2. &lt;br /&gt;

Pole pitch is 2pi/number of poles. Again, divide the answer by 2 to get elec deg.

Then a=pole pitch - coil pitch.  &lt;br /&gt;
And one can say that the winding is short pitched by a.

Putting the value of a in (2) gives the K&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; which will go in (1) to get the winding distribution factor. &lt;br /&gt;

Example: &lt;br /&gt;
For a 3-phase 6 slot 4 pole non-overlapping winding motor: &lt;br /&gt;
Coil pitch=2pi/6 = pi/3 (mech) and 2pi/3 (elec)g
Pole pitch =2pi/
4=pi/2(mech) &amp; pi (elec)&lt;br /&gt;

Most of 3phase motors have winding factor values between 0.85 and 0.95.

The winding factor (along with some other factors like winding skew) can help to improve the [[Harmonic Contents]] in the generated EMF of machine.
