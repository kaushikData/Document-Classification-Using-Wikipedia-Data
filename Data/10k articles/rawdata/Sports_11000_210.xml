'''Andrew Paul (Pepper) Oyler''' (May 5, 1880 &amp;ndash; October 24, 1970) was a [[Major League Baseball]] [[third baseman]]. He was born in [[Newville, Pennsylvania]] and attended [[Washington &amp; Jefferson College]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Andy Oyler 
 | work =[[Baseball-Reference.com]] | publisher = | date = | url =https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/o/oyleran01.shtml | accessdate = May 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He played professionally for the [[Baltimore Orioles (1901–02)|Baltimore Orioles]] in the {{Baseball year|1902}} season. In 27 professional games that year, he had 77 at-bats with 17 hits and one home run.

He batted and threw right-handed. He was small in stature and was an excellent fielder, but not a good hitter.&lt;ref name=jocko /&gt;  Even so, he was difficult to pitch to, since he would crouch "pretzel-like" in the [[batter's box]] to make his [[strike zone]] smaller.&lt;ref name=jocko&gt;{{Cite news | last = Maxwell| first = Jocko| authorlink = Sherman Maxwell| title = Inch-hit Homer!| newspaper = [[Baseball Digest]]| pages = 29–30| date = April 1953| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=9jIDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA29| accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He died in [[East Pennsboro Township, Pennsylvania]].

==Shortest home run in history==

In 1953, sportswriter [[Jocko Maxwell]] published an article in ''[[Baseball Digest]]'' describing the shortest [[home run]] in baseball history.&lt;ref name=jocko /&gt;  Maxwell described a baseball game where Oyler, as a shortstop for the [[Minneapolis Millers]], was crouched in the batters' box in the bottom of the 9th and ducked to avoid a pitch thrown at his head.&lt;ref name=jocko /&gt;  The ball hit off of Oyler's bat, which was still resting on his shoulder, and became stuck in the mud in front of [[home plate]].&lt;ref name=jocko /&gt;  Oyler was able to complete an [[inside-the-park home run]] before any opposing players were able to find the ball.&lt;ref name=jocko /&gt;  Maxwell's article indicated that the story was originally told by [[WWRL]] radio station in [[Woodside, New York]].&lt;ref name=jocko /&gt;  This story was repeated by sportswriter [[Bill Bryson, Sr.]] in ''Baseball Digest'' in 1958.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last = Bryson| first = Bill| authorlink = Bill Bryson, Sr.| title = The World's Shortest Home Runs| newspaper = [[Baseball Digest]]| pages = 67–68| date = October 1958| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=LzMDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA67| accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another version of the story, as told by [[Halsey Hall]], had Oyler chopping at a low pitch and sticking the ball into the mud 5{{fraction|1|2}} feet from home plate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last = Thornley| first = Stew| authorlink = Stew Thornley| title = Halsey Hall: Baseball's Consummate Story Teller  | newspaper = [[Baseball Digest]]| date = September 1991|page=77| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Ui4DAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA77| accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Baseball historian [[Stew Thornley]] is skeptical of the story of Oyler's home run, pointing out that no contemporary news reports described the incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Thornley| first =Stew  |authorlink=Stew Thornley| title = Short Home Runs: Mythical and Real| newspaper = Baseball in Minnesota: the Definitive History |publisher=[[Minnesota Historical Society]]| year = 2006|page=51| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=D0u6nMN6iwoC&amp;pg=PA51 | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other modern reference sources recount the story without caveat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Stewart| first =Mark | author2 = Mike Kennedy| title = Long ball: the Legend and Lore of the Home Run| publisher = Milbrook Press| year =2006| page = 49| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=RFfmHNZ_SQIC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The story was the subject of a book of baseball lore by [[Michael G. Bryson]] called ''[[The Twenty-Four-Inch Home Run]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Bryson| first = Michael G.| authorlink = Michael G. Bryson| title = The Twenty-Four-Inch Home Run | publisher =Contemporary Books | year = 1990 | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=SyL2PAAACAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was also the inspiration for the children's book, ''Mudball'' by [[Matt Tavares]], which won the 2005 [[Parents' Choice Award|Parents' Choice Awards Gold Award]].&lt;ref name=mudball&gt;{{Cite book| last = Tavares| first = Matt| authorlink = Matt Tavares| title = Mudball| publisher = Candlewick Press| year = 2005| pages = | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=-afVjbYgGxYC| isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the "Author's Note" Tavares describes the story of Oyler's home run as being [[folklore]].&lt;ref name=mudball /&gt;

[[File:Fisher the Bear.jpg|thumb|upright|A captive bear tests a canister.]]

'''Bear-resistant food storage containers''', also called '''bear canisters''' or '''bear cans''', are usually hard-sided containers used by [[backpacking (wilderness)|backpackers]] to protect their food from theft by [[bear]]s. Bear canisters are seeing increased popularity in areas where bears have become [[habituation|habituated]] to human presence, and are required&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rei.com/learn/expert-advice/bear-resistant-canisters.html|title=Bear Canister Basics - REI Expert Advice|last=REI|website=www.rei.com|access-date=2016-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; in some regions such as [[Yosemite National Park]] in the [[United States]].

==Construction==
[[File:Bear-resistant trash can at the Aspen Institute.JPG|thumb|Bear-resistant trash bin may be opened only by humans, not bears.]]
A bear canister&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rei.com/learn/expert-advice/bear-resistant-canisters.html|title=Bear Canister Basics - REI Expert Advice|last=REI|website=www.rei.com|access-date=2016-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; typically weighs between 2-4&amp;nbsp;lb (1-2&amp;nbsp;kg), and has a storage capacity of 400 - 900 in&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (6 - 15 liters). The actual capacity in number of days of [[hiking]] food stored varies with the appetite of the [[hiking|hiker]], the selection of food, and the skill in which it is packed, but a 700 in&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; canister likely holds up to a week's worth of food for the average hiker.

Hard-sided bear cans employ such materials as [[polycarbonate]], [[Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene|ABS]] plastic, [[carbon fiber]], and [[aluminum]] in their construction. An effective canister must resist both the tremendous strength and high [[animal intelligence|intelligence]] of an attacking animal. Most containers are too large for a bear to simply pick up and carry away.

The [[lid (container)|lid]] of a canister is usually recessed in order to prevent it being pried off, and [[tool]] use, or at least an advanced degree of [[motor skill]]s, is required to remove it. Some bear canisters contain gaskets that block the scent from escaping the container.

At least one model of soft-sided "bear bag" is made from Spectra ([[UHMWPE]]) fabric. While a soft-sided container may prevent a bear from [[eating]] its contents, the food inside is likely to be reduced to [[purée]] in the attempt. A newer model comes with an aluminum stiffener that protects the contents more effectively than the bag alone.

==Regulations==
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2013}}
A few [[national park]]s and national forests require [[wilderness|backcountry]] visitors to carry "approved" food storage containers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nps.gov/grte/planyourvisit/back.htm|title=Backcountry Camping - Grand Teton National Park (U.S. National Park Service)|website=www.nps.gov|access-date=2016-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Backpackers who ignore this policy may face fines, property impounded, or eviction from the wilderness. [[park ranger|Ranger]]s may stop hikers and require them to produce their containers for inspection.

The [[Sierra Interagency Black Bear Group]] (SIBBG) and the [[Interagency Grizzly Bear Committee]] regulate the approval of food storage containers in parts of the western United States. Containers effective against the [[American black bear]]s in the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] may not be effective against the [[grizzly bear]]s found elsewhere. SIBBG conducts visual inspection and various structural tests, then containers are filled with food and left in the cages of captive black bears in a [[zoo]] in [[California]]. If the canister survives the zoo test, it is then ''conditionally'' approved. Full approval is only given after three months of successful field tests by users.

[[Image:Wilderness_food_storage.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A stationary steel food storage box at a campsite. Popular destinations equipped with these enable backpackers to do without a bear canister.]]

It is recommended that canisters be left on the ground, at least 100 feet /30 metres from the campsite. Suspending the canister can allow the bear to smash it to the ground or use the suspension gear to carry it away. To prevent a bear from rolling it away, the container could be left in a bush, a shallow depression, or wedged between rocks or logs. Placing the canister near water could allow the container to float away. Reflective tape and labelling the container helps in recovery.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dec.ny.gov/animals/30876.html Bear Resistant Canisters FAQs] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120714202914/http://www.dec.ny.gov/animals/30876.html |date=July 14, 2012 }} from the [[New York State Department of Environmental Conservation]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bear bagging==
An alternative is ''bear bagging'', wherein items attractive to a bear such as [[food]] or other perishables are placed in a bag and then raised into the air using a rope &amp;mdash; out of reach of a bear. The rationale is that bears, being unable to reach the food, are less drawn to campsites and pose less of a threat to [[camping|campers]] and their equipment.

Lightweight nylon stuff sacks are often used for bear bags, but they can be made simply of a large enough square or rectangular piece of cloth or [[tarpaulin|tarp]] with the food items placed in the center of the tarp and the corners brought up and tied around with [[rope]]. The rope is then used to tie the bag in the air where it cannot be reached from the ground or from a [[tree]] by a bear. Often this is done by tying another length of rope tightly between two trees or other tall objects. In problem areas, a bear bag should be at least 12 feet (3.5 m) high and 10 feet (3 m) from any vertical support. The counterbalance method, Marrison system, and the Pacific Crest Trail method are a few different techniques to use when hanging a bear bag.

In areas where trash cannot be burned (much of the United States and especially during dry seasons) and no fortified [[Waste|trash]] containers are available, trash may also be raised in a separate bear bag to keep the food smells from attracting bears.

In severe problem areas for bears, such as a majority of Yosemite National Park, bear bagging is ineffective and has been banned.&lt;ref name="Bear Regulations - Yosemite"&gt;[http://www.nps.gov/yose/planyourvisit/bears.htm Bears and Food Storage] from the [[Yosemite National Park]] official website&lt;/ref&gt;

==Product failure==
Yellow-Yellow, a wild 125-pound [[American black bear|black bear]] in the [[Adirondacks]] near [[North Elba, New York]], had figured out how to open several models of the BearVault, an approved container. Other bears there have reportedly also learned the skill, but those suspicions have not been confirmed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Lisa W.|last= Foderaro  |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/25/nyregion/25bear.html?hp |title=Bear-Proof Can Is Pop-Top Picnic for a Crafty Thief  |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=July 24, 2009  |accessdate=2009-07-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For a period, the manufacturer discouraged use of the BearVault in the bears' [[territory (animal)|territory]].&lt;ref name="bearvaultproductnotice"&gt;"[http://www.bearvault.com/bearvault_productnotices.php Product Notices] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090730180531/http://www.bearvault.com/bearvault_productnotices.php |date=July 30, 2009 }}" BearVault.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Darts''' is a sport in which [[dart (missile)|small missiles]] are thrown at a circular dartboard fixed to a wall.&lt;ref name="definition"&gt;{{cite web|title=Darts|url=http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/darts|work=The Free Dictionary|accessdate=21 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though various boards and rules have been used in the past, the term "darts" usually now refers to a standardised game involving a specific board design and set of rules. As well as being a professional competitive game, darts is a traditional [[pub game]], commonly played in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and [[Ireland]], across the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Belgium]], [[Germany]], the [[Scandinavia]]n countries, the [[United States]], and elsewhere.

==Equipment==
===Dartboard===
[[File:Dartboard diagram.svg|right|250px]]

Darts were historically used in warfare in ancient history; skirmishers used darts of varying sizes, similar to miniature javelins. It was the practice of this skill that developed into a game of skill.
Before the First World War, [[pub]]s in the United Kingdom had dartboards made from solid blocks of wood, usually elm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Nodor - Winmau Story|url=http://www.patrickchaplin.com/NodorWinmaustory.htm|publisher=PatrickChaplin|accessdate=25 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The history of darts|url=http://www.talkdarts.co.uk/guides/history_of_darts.html|publisher=TalkDarts|accessdate=25 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; They had to be soaked overnight to heal the holes made by the darts, and it was a messy business for the [[pub]]lican, although darts was a popular game. This changed when a company called Nodor, whose primary business was making [[modelling clay]] (which has no odour, hence the name Nodor), started producing clay dartboards in 1923. The clay dartboards never caught on, and Nodor switched to making the traditional elm dartboards that were popular at the time. Their model of dartboard was not a great success until someone came up with the idea of using the [[Agave americana|century plant]] to make a dartboard. Small bundles of [[sisal]] fibres of the same length were bundled together. The bundles were then compressed into a disk and bound with a metal ring. It was an instant success, as the darts did little or no damage to the board—they just parted the fibres when they entered the board; this type of board was more durable and required little maintenance.

Quality dartboards are still made of [[sisal]] [[Fiber|fibres]]; less expensive boards are sometimes made of [[cork (material)|cork]] or coiled paper. However, several types of sisal fibre are used in dartboards today, originating from East Africa, Brazil, or China. Despite widespread belief that some dartboards are constructed using pig bristles, camel hair, or horse hair, there is no evidence that boards have ever been produced commercially from these materials.

A regulation board is {{frac|17|3|4}} inches (451&amp;nbsp;mm) in diameter and is divided into 20 radial sections. Each section is separated with metal wire or a thin band of sheet metal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mylocalnews.com/darts/bdo-playing-rules/ |title=British Darts Organisation Officially Website |work=BDO darts |date=1 April 2006 |accessdate=19 May 2015 }}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The best dartboards have the thinnest wire, so that the darts have less chance of hitting a wire and bouncing out. The numbers indicating the various scoring sections of the board are also normally made of wire, especially on tournament-quality boards. The wire ring on which the numbers are welded can be turned to facilitate even wear of the board. Boards of lesser quality often have the numbers printed directly on the board.

In the late '70s, companies devised and began producing electronic dartboards. These dartboards have electronic scoring computers that are preprogrammed with a wide variety of game types. The board is made of plastic facings with small holes. The holes slant out, allowing the plastic-tipped darts to stick inside. When a dart strikes the board, the section makes contact with a metal plate, telling the computer where the player has thrown. These "soft-tip" darts and automated boards greatly increased the game's popularity in the United States.

Illumination should be arranged to brightly illuminate the dartboard and minimize shadows of thrown darts.
The main supply for the illumination should be protected against accidental piercing, or placed away from the board.

====History====
[[File:HOPE-AND-ANCHOR-DART-CLUB.JPG|thumb|"Hope and Anchor dart club", [[Hope and Anchor (Hammersmith)|Hope and Anchor]], 20 Waterloo Street (now Macbeth Street), Hammersmith, London, UK. ca 1925. NB publican Charles Fletcher (seated front row center) with elm board]]
[[File:Darts gameplay.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Playing darts]]
The dartboard may have its origins in the cross-section of a tree. An old name for a dartboard is "[[Archery butts|butt]]"; the word comes from the French word ''but'', meaning "target".&lt;ref&gt;''Webster's Third New International Dictionary of the English Language'', Chicago: Encyclopædia Britannica, 1966, 304.&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, the Yorkshire and Manchester Log End boards differ from the standard board in that they have no triple, only double and bullseye, the Manchester board being of a smaller diameter, with a playing area of only 25&amp;nbsp;cm (9.84&amp;nbsp;in) across with double and bull areas measuring just 4&amp;nbsp;mm (0.157in.). The London Fives board is another variation. This has only 12 equal segments numbered 20, 5, 15, 10, 20, 5, 15, 10, 20, 5, 15, 10 with the doubles and trebles being a quarter of an inch (6.35mm) wide.

There is a speculation that the game originated among soldiers throwing short arrows at the bottom of a cask or at the bottom of trunks of trees. As the wood dried, cracks would develop, creating "sections". Soon, regional standards emerged and many woodworkers supplemented bar tabs by fabricating dart boards for the local pubs.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

It is generally said that the standard numbering plan with a 20 on top was created in 1896 by [[Lancashire]] carpenter Brian Gamlin,&lt;ref&gt;[http://dartsinfoworld.com/history-of-darts/ Darts History] - Darts Info World&lt;/ref&gt; though this is disputed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.darts501.com/Number.html|title=Darts 501 - Brian Gamlin Dartboard Numbers|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tradgames.org.uk/games/Darts.htm|title=Darts - History and information on Dartboards and darts|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, a great many other configurations have been used throughout the years and in different geographical locations. Gamlin's layout was devised to penalise inaccuracy. Although this applies to most of the board, the left-hand side (near the 14 section) is preferred by beginners, for its concentration of larger numbers. Mathematically, removing the rotational symmetry by placing the "20" at the top, there are [[factorial|19!]], or 121,645,100,408,832,000 possible dartboards. Many different layouts would penalise a player more than the current setup; however, the current setup actually does the job rather efficiently. There have been several mathematical papers published that consider the "optimal" dartboard.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example: '''(1)''' K. Selkirk (1976) "Redesigning the dartboard", ''Mathematical Gazette'', vol. 60, pages 171–178 ; '''(2)''' P.J. Everson and A.P. Bassom. (January 1995) "Optimal arrangements for a dartboard", ''Mathematical Spectrum'', vol. 27, no. 2, pages 32–34 ; '''(3)''' H. A.

===Darts===
Initially the missiles were simply cut down arrows or crossbow bolts.&lt;ref name=Harrows1&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.harrowsdarts.com/harrows-world/history-darts |title=History of Darts from Harrows, UK|page=|date=|work= |publisher=Harrows|accessdate=25 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first purpose-made darts were manufactured in one piece from wood; wrapped with a strip of lead for weight and fitted with flights made from split turkey feathers. These darts were mainly imported from France and became known as French darts.&lt;ref name=Chaplin&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.patrickchaplin.com/Darts.htm|title=The History of the Dart|page=|date=|work=2007 |publisher=Patrick Chaplin|accessdate=12 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Metal barrels were patented in 1906 but wood continued to be used into the 1950s.&lt;ref name=Harrows1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Harrows2&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.harrowsdarts.com/harrows-world/history-darts|title=History of Darts from Harrows, UK|page=|date=|work= |publisher=Harrows|accessdate=12 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The first metal barrels were made from brass which was relatively cheap and easy to work.&lt;ref name=Chaplin /&gt; The wooden shafts, which were now threaded to fit the tapped barrel, were either fletched as before or designed to take a paper flight. This type of dart continued to be used into the 1970s.&lt;ref name=Chaplin/&gt; When the advantages of using plastic were realised, the shaft and flight became separate entities, although one piece moulded plastic shaft and flights were also available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dartdealer.com/displayproduct.aspx?cid=340|title=Moulded plastic flights|publisher=Dart Dealer |accessdate=12 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern darts have four parts: the points, the barrels, the shafts and the flights.&lt;ref name=Dartsworld&gt;{{cite web|url= http://dartsinfoworld.com/about-darts/the-darts/ |title= About darts|page=|date= |publisher=dartsinfoworld.com|accessdate=12 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The steel points come in 2 common lengths, 32mm and 41mm and are sometimes knurled or coated to improve grip. Others are designed to retract slightly on impact to lessen the chance of bouncing out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://thebro.zone/darts/best-darts|title=Selecting the Right Darts|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Thebro.zone|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The barrels come in a variety of weights and are usually constructed from brass, silver-nickel, or a [[tungsten]] alloy.&lt;ref name=china&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinadart.com/different_darts.htm|title= Darts|date=|work=|publisher=China Tungsten|page=|accessdate=12 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brass is cheap but light and therefore brass barrels tend to be very bulky. Tungsten on the other hand, is twice as dense as brass thus a barrel of an equivalent weight could be thirty percent smaller in diameter.&lt;ref name=Harrows3&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.harrowsdarts.com|title= Tungsten Technology|publisher= Harrows Darts|accessdate=12 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tungsten is very brittle however and so an alloy of between 80 and 95&amp;nbsp;per cent tungsten is used. The remainder is usually nickel, iron, or copper.&lt;ref name=Harrows3/&gt; Silver-nickel darts offer a compromise between density and cost.

Barrels come in 3 basic shapes: cylindrical, torpedo, or ton.&lt;ref name=China2&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.chinadart.com/tungsten_dart_barrel_shape.htm |title=Barrel shape|work=|publisher=China Dart|page=|accessdate=12 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cylindrical barrels are the same diameter along their entire length and so tend to be long and thin. Their slenderness makes them better for grouping but because they are long, the centre of gravity is further back. Ton shaped barrels are thin at either end but bulge in the middle. This makes them fatter than a cylindrical barrel of equivalent weight but the centre of gravity is further forward and so theoretically easier to throw. Torpedo shaped barrels are widest at the point end and taper towards the rear. This keeps the weight as far forward as possible but like the ton, gives it a larger diameter than the cylinder.

The shafts are manufactured in various lengths and some are designed to be cut to length. Shafts are generally made from plastics, nylon polymers, or metals such as aluminium and titanium; and can be rigid or flexible.&lt;ref name=china3&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chinadart.com/dart_accessories_shaft.htm |title=Shafts |publisher=Chinadart |accessdate=12 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Longer shafts provide greater stability and allow a reduction in flight size which in turn can lead to closer grouping; but they also shift the weight towards the rear causing the dart to tilt backwards during flight,requiring a harder, faster throw. A longer shaft will however make the dart less responsive and increase the chance of "wobbling".

The primary purpose of the flight is to produce drag and thus prevent the rear of the dart overtaking the point.&lt;ref name=Dartsworld/&gt; It also has an effect on stability by reducing wobble. Modern flights are generally made from plastic, nylon, or foil and are available in a range of shapes and sizes. The three most common shapes in order of size are the standard, the kite, and the smaller pear shape. The less surface area, the less stability but larger flights hamper close grouping. Some manufactures have sought to solve this by making a flight long and thin but this in turn creates other problems such as changing the dart's centre of gravity. Generally speaking a heavier dart will require a larger flight.&lt;ref name=Dartsworld/&gt;

The choice of barrel, shaft, and flight will depend a great deal on the individual player's throwing style. For competitive purposes a dart cannot weigh more than 50g including the shaft and flight and cannot exceed a total length of 300mm.&lt;ref name=Harrows1/&gt;

====Playing dimensions====
The WDF uses the following standards for play:

Height - the dart board is hung so that the centre of the bulls eye is 5&amp;nbsp;ft 8 inches (1.73&amp;nbsp;m) from the floor. This is considered eye-level for a six-foot man.

Distance - the [[oche]] (line behind which the thrower must stand) should be 7&amp;nbsp;ft 9¼ inches (2.37&amp;nbsp;m) from the face of the board. If the face projects outward from the wall, due to the thickness of the board and/or a cabinet in which it is mounted, the oche must be moved back appropriately to maintain the required distance.

The regulations came about due to the United Kingdom and the rest of the world playing at different lengths, with 7&amp;nbsp;ft 9¼ inches (2.37&amp;nbsp;m) being the compromised length.

==Scoring==
[[File:Dartboard_heatmap.svg|thumb|Scores for each region of a dartboard (not to scale) shaded by value]]
The standard dartboard is divided into 20 numbered sections, scoring from 1 to 20 points, by wires running from the small central circle to the outer circular wire. Circular wires within the outer wire subdivide each section into single, double and triple areas. The dartboard featured on the "Indoor League" television show of the 1970s did not feature a triple section, and according to host Fred Trueman during the first episode, this is the traditional Yorkshire board.

Various games can be played (and still are played informally) using the standard dartboard. However, in the official game, any dart landing inside the outer wire scores as follows:
*Hitting one of the large portions of each of the numbered sections, traditionally alternately coloured black and white, scores the points value of that section.
* Hitting the thin inner portions of these sections, roughly halfway between the outer wire and the central circle coloured red or green, scores triple the points value of that section.
* Hitting the thin outer portions of these sections, again coloured red or green, scores double the points value of that section. The double-20 is often referred to as double-top, reflecting the 20's position on the dartboard.
*The central circle is divided into a green outer ring worth 25 points (known as "outer", "outer bull", or "single bull") and a red or black inner circle (usually known as "bull", "inner bull" or "double bull"), worth 50 points. The term "bullseye" can mean either the whole central part of the board or just the inner red/black section. The term "bull's ring" usually means just the green outer ring. The inner bull counts as a double when doubling in or out.
*Hitting outside the outer wire scores nothing.
* A dart only scores if its point is embedded in or is touching the playing surface. This rule applies to any dart that lands in such a way as to be partially or totally supported by others that have already hit the board.
* When a standard board is used, any dart whose point does not remain in contact with the playing surface until being collected by the player does not score. This includes darts that bounce off the board for any reason, that fall off on their own, or that are dislodged by the impact of later throws. However, when an electronic board is used, fallen/dislodged darts do score as long as their impacts have registered on the board first.

The highest score possible with three darts is 180, commonly known as a "ton 80" (100 points is called a ton), obtained when all three darts land in the triple 20. In the [[television|televised]] game, the [[referee]] frequently announces a score of 180 in exuberant style. A "quad" ring appeared briefly between the triple ring and the bull in the 1990s, leading to a potential ''240'' maximum (three quad-20s), a ''210'' maximum checkout (Q20-Q20-Bull) and ''seven'' dart finishes from a 501 start (five quad-20s, triple-17, bullseye), but was swiftly dropped from professional tournament play after only two years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qzifRI2UrI|title=Jocky Wilson Only 240 Ever Seen vs John Lowe Skol World Matchplay|date=16 November 2013|work=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; One make of this board was the Harrows Quadro 240.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crowsdarts.com/reviews/quadro.html|title=QUADRO Dartboard|author=Tim Cronian|work=crowsdarts.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Skill level and aiming===
[[Image:Optimal Dart Throw Location Skill Level.jpg|thumb|Path of the optimal location to throw a dart where σ = 0 is a perfect player and σ = 100 is a player who throws randomly.]]
Assuming standard scoring, the optimal area to aim for on the dart board in order to maximize the player's score varies significantly based on the players skill. The skilled player should aim for the centre of the T20 and as the player's skill decreases, their aim moves slightly up and to the left of the T20. At σ = 16.4&amp;nbsp;mm the best place to aim jumps to the T19. As the player's skill decreases further, the best place to aim curls into the centre of the board, stopping a bit lower than and to the left of the bullseye at σ = 100.&lt;ref&gt;Ryan J. Tibshirani, Andrew Price, and Jonathan Taylor (January 2011) [http://www-stat.stanford.edu/~ryantibs/papers/darts.pdf "A statistician plays darts"], ''Journal of the Royal Statistical Society'', series A, vol. 174, no. 1, pages 213–226&lt;/ref&gt;

==Games==
There are many games that can be played on a dartboard, but the term "darts" generally refers to a game in which one player at a time throws three darts per visit to the board. The throwing player must stand so that no portion of his/her feet extends past the leading edge of the oche, but may stand on any other portion and/or lean forward over it if desired.

The most common objective is to reduce a fixed score, commonly 301 or 501, to zero ("checking out"). The final dart must land in either the bullseye or a double segment in order to win. A game of darts is generally contested between two players, who take turns. Each turn consists of throwing three darts. When two teams play, the starting score is sometimes increased to 701 or even 1001; the rules remain the same.

A throw that reduces a player's score below zero, to exactly one, or to zero but not ending with a double is known as "going bust", with the player's score being reset to the value prior to starting the turn, and the remainder of the turn being forfeited.

In some variants (called a "northern bust" in London) only the dart that causes the bust is not counted. That is felt by some to be a purer version of the game, as under the normal rules, as explained above, a player left with a difficult finish, e.g. 5 and one dart remaining will often deliberately "bust" it in order to get back to the easier finish that they had at the start of their go. For example, a player with 20 at the start of their go could miss the double 10 and get a single, miss the double 5 and get a single, leaving them 5 and only one dart remaining. Their best option is to deliberately bust it to get back onto double 10. Under the "northern bust" they would remain on 5.

A darts match is played over a fixed number of games, known as legs. A match may be divided into sets, with each set being contested as over a fixed number of legs.

Although playing straight down from 501 is standard in darts, sometimes a double must be hit to begin scoring, known as "doubling in", with all darts thrown before hitting a double not being counted. The PDC's [[World Grand Prix (darts)|World Grand Prix]] uses this format.

The minimum number of thrown darts required to complete a leg of 501 is nine. The most common [[nine dart finish]] consists of two 180 maximums followed by a 141 checkout (T20-T19-D12), but there are many other possible ways of achieving the feat. Three 167s (T20-T19-Bull) is considered a pure or perfect nine dart finish by some players.

===Other games and variants===
There are a number of regional variations on the standard rules and scoring systems.

====Round the Clock====
"Round the clock" is a variation that involves hitting the numbers in sequence, known as "around the world" in Australia and New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dartboardsguide.com/knowledge/darts-rules-dart-games/|title=Dart Games and Dart Rules|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Jumpers" is a faster variation of Round the Clock believed to have originated amongst the British ex-pat community in Asia.{{clarify|and what actually is it?|date=October 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bkjumpersleague.bravehost.com] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012144849/http://bkjumpersleague.bravehost.com/ |date=2007-10-12 }} Bangkok Jumpers League&lt;/ref&gt;

====20 to 1====
20 to 1 is a Dutch variation of the "around the world" darts game that differs significantly. This game uses the standard 20 number dartboard with the triple and double rings. In Dutch it's called "Van 20 naar 1". 20 to 1 is typically played between 2, 3, 4 or 5 players, or 2 teams of max 5 players. The goal of 20 to 1 is to be the first player or team to throw all numbers in consecutive order from 20 to 1 and win the game with outer or inner bullseye.

====Around the world====
"Around the world" is a game whereby each player must hit consecutive numbers on the board in order to proceed to the next round. In a one on one battle the winner is the person to reach the last number or bullseye. In a team competition the winner is the first team to reach the last number or bullseye after the round is complete or each member of each team has thrown that specific round.

====American darts====
{{Main article|American Darts}}
American Darts is a regional USA variant of the game (most U.S. dart players play the traditional games described above). This style of dart board is most often found in eastern Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, and parts of New York state.

====Archery darts====
This is played in exactly the same way as a regular game of darts, but using [[Recurve bow|recurve]] or [[compound bow]]s to shoot full length [[arrow]]s from a distance to hit a 60&amp;nbsp;cm or 90&amp;nbsp;cm paper target face that looks like a dartboard. These are commercially produced, but usually only in black &amp; white.

====Audio darts====
A variant of traditional darts played using a blindfold. Often played by people with visual disabilities. Typically a talking electronic dartboard is used to speak the numbers hit, keep score and announce who is throwing next.

====Cricket====
{{Main article|Cricket (darts)}}

Cricket is a widely played darts game involving a race to control and score on numbers between 20 and 15 and the bullseye, by hitting each of these targets for three marks to ''open'' or ''own'' it for scoring.  A hit on the target counts as one mark, while hits in the doubles ring of the target count as two marks in one throw, and on the triples ring as three. Once opened in this manner, until the opponent ''closes'' that number with three marks on it of their own, each additional hit by the owner/opener scores points equal to the number of the target (which may also be doubled and tripled, e.g. a triple-20 is worth 60 points).  The outer bullseye counts as 25 points, and the inner as 50.

====Dartball====
{{Main article|Dartball}}
Dartball is a darts game based on the sport of [[baseball]]. It is played on a diamond shaped board and has similar scoring to baseball.

====Dart golf====
{{Main article|Dart golf}}
Dart golf is a darts game based on the sport of [[golf]] and is regulated by the World Dolf Federation (WDFF).&lt;ref&gt;"History of Dolf" http://www.dolfdarts.com/history-of-dolf&lt;/ref&gt; It is played on both special golf dartboards and traditional dartboards. Scoring is similar to golf.

====Fives====
[[Image:FivesDartboard.jpg|thumb|right|200px|An '[[East End of London|East-End]]' or 'Fives' dartboard]]
This is a regional variant still played in some parts of the East End of London. The board has fewer, larger segments, all numbered either 5, 10, 15 or 20. Players play down from 505 rather than 501, and stand the farthest ({{convert|9|ft|disp=or|abbr=on}}) away from the board of any mainstream variation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eastlondonadvertiser.co.uk/content/towerhamlets/advertiser/sport/story.aspx?brand=ELAOnline&amp;category=sportgeneric&amp;tBrand=northlondon24&amp;tCategory=sportela&amp;itemid=WeED23%20Jul%202008%2014%3A53%3A17%3A537 East London Advertiser] Fives still alive in darts&lt;/ref&gt;

====Halve it====
{{Main article|Halve it}}
“Halve it” is a darts game popular in the [[United Kingdom]] and parts of [[North America]] where competitors try to hit previously agreed targets on a standard dart board.&lt;ref name=diddle&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.diddleforthemiddle.com/halve-it.php |title=Dart games - Halve it |publisher=Diddle for the Middle |accessdate=14 November 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110903180454/http://www.diddleforthemiddle.com/halve-it.php |archivedate=3 September 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Failure to do so within a single throw (3 darts) results in the player losing half their accumulated score. Any number of players can take part and the game can vary in length depending on the number of targets selected.&lt;ref name=501darts&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.darts501.com/Halveit.htm |title= General rules for 'Halve it' |publisher=Darts 501 |accessdate=14 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The game can be tailored to the skill level of the players by selecting easy or difficult targets.

====Killer====
"Killer" is a 'knock-out' game for two or more players (at its best at 4–6 players). Initially each player throws a dart at the board with their non-dominant hand to obtain their 'number'. No two players can have the same number. Once everyone has a number, each player takes it in turn to get their number five times with their three darts (doubles count twice, and triples three times). Once a person has reached 5, they become a 'killer'. This means they can aim for other peoples numbers, taking a point off for each time they hit (doubles x2, triples x3). If a person gets to zero they are out. A killer can aim for anyone's numbers, even another killer's. Players cannot get more than 5 points. The winner is 'the last man standing'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/world_darts_2004/3334207.stm |title=Board of brilliant versatility |work=[[BBC Sport]] |date=29 December 2003 |accessdate=2010-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Lawn darts====
{{main article|Lawn darts}}
Lawn darts (also called Jarts or yard darts) is a lawn game based on darts. The game play and objective are similar to both [[horseshoes]] and darts. The darts are similar to the ancient [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[plumbata]].

==== Moving Target ====
Moving Target is a darts game for two or more players in which each round, one player serves as the "setter" to set the target, and each other player is a "scorer" and tries to score points. The role of "setter" rotates from player to player each round. The first player to reach 21 points (or any other predetermined number of points) wins the game. In each round, the setter throws two darts to set the target for the round. The target is equal to either the sum or the difference of the two darts thrown by the setter. Doubles and triples do not count for these two darts. A bullseye thrown by the setter counts for 25. For example, if the setter throws a bullseye and a five, the target is either 30 or 20 (25 + 5 = 30 and 25 – 5 = 20). Once a target has been set, the scorer has three darts to equal the target and score points. Each dart is considered individually. Doubles and triples do count for this dart, so there may be multiple ways to hit the target. A bullseye thrown by the scorer counts for either 25 or 0. A scorer can score between 0 and 9 points per round. If the scorer hits a target number with a single, the scorer gets 1 point. If the scorer hits a target number with a double or a single bullseye, the scorer gets 2 points. If the scorer hits the target number with a triple, the scorer gets 3 points. If the scorer hits the target number with a double-bullseye, this is called a ZARTRON! A player who scores a ZARTRON! gets 3 points and skips their next turn as setter, allowing an opportunity to score again right away.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.movingtargetdarts.com|title=Moving Target|website=www.movingtargetdarts.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Shanghai====
Shanghai is a darts game of accuracy.&lt;ref name="Shanghai"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.diddleforthemiddle.com/shanghai.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-07-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090706053618/http://www.diddleforthemiddle.com/shanghai.php |archivedate=2009-07-06 |df= }} Dart Games: Shanghai&lt;/ref&gt; Hitting doubles and triples is paramount to victory. This game is played with at least two players. The standard version is played in 7 rounds.&lt;ref name="Shanghai"/&gt; In round one players throw their darts aiming for the 1 section, round 2, the 2 section and so on until round 7. Standard scoring is used, and doubles and triples are counted. Only hits on the wedge for that round are counted. The winner is the person who has the most points at the end of seven rounds (1–7); or who scores a Shanghai, which wins win instantly, a Shanghai being throws that hit a triple, a double and single (in any order) of the number that is in play.&lt;ref name="Shanghai"/&gt;

Shanghai can also be played for 20 rounds to use all numbers. A Fairer Start for Shanghai: To prevent players from becoming too practiced at shooting for the 1, the number sequence can begin at the number of the dart that lost the throw for the bullseye to determine the starting thrower. For example; Thrower A shoots for the bullseye and hits the 17. Thrower B shoots for the bullseye and hits it. Thrower B then begins the game, starting on the number 17, then 18, 19, 20, 1, 2, 3, etc. through 16 (if no player hits Shanghai).

====Seventeen Skunk====
A reverse form of unscored Cricket, beginning with the bullseye. Once any player has cleared the 17, any players who have not cleared bullseye are eliminated.

====Darf====
Objective is to have the lowest score at the end of the game. Six rounds of darts, the first five are scored at their value (missing the board is 30 points), while the sixth round is one dart that subtracts from the current total.

====Ice Breaker====
Objective is to be the first team to reach a score of 150, with only 1-12 counting towards a player's score. Doubles and triples of 1-12 still count, though throws must single in and out. Scoring a bullseye (an ice breaker) will put everyone’s score back to zero. Only three ice breakers can be scored per game.

==Darts organisations==
===Professional organisations===
{{Main article|Split in darts}}

Of the two [[professional]] organisations, the [[British Darts Organisation]] (BDO), founded 1973, is the older. Its tournaments were often shown on the [[BBC]] in the UK. The BDO is a member of the [[World Darts Federation]] (WDF) (founded 1976), along with organizations in some 60 other countries worldwide. The BDO originally organised a number of the more prestigious British tournaments with a few notable exceptions such as the News of the World Championship and the national events run under the auspices of the National Darts Association of Great Britain. However, many sponsors were lost and British TV coverage became much reduced by the early nineties.

In 1992 a breakaway organisation was formed, initially known as the World Darts Council (WDC) but shortly after known as the [[Professional Darts Corporation]] (PDC). The PDC tournaments have a considerable following, although the PDC World Championship attracts lower TV viewing figures than that of the BDO due to the BDO World Championship being free to view on the BBC. However, due to the BBC picking up the [[2016 Champions League of Darts|inaugural]] [[Champions League of Darts]] set to begin on 24 September 2016, they will no longer be broadcasting the BDO World Championship.

The PDC tournaments often have higher prize money and feature the leading player in the history of the game, 16-time World Champion [[Phil Taylor (darts player)|Phil Taylor]]. The highly successful BDO player [[Raymond van Barneveld]] switched to the PDC and won the PDC World Championship at his first attempt in 2007.

===Amateur league organisations===
The American Darts Organization promulgates rules and standards for amateur league darts and sanctions tournaments in the United States. The American Darts Organization began operation January 1, 1976 with 30 charter member clubs and a membership of 7,500 players. Today, the ADO has a membership that averages 250 clubs on a yearly basis representing roughly 50,000 members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adodarts.com/history/ |title=American Darts Organization Official Website |work=ADO darts |date=23 February 2011 |accessdate=25 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; l

==Professional play==
The BDO and PDC both organise a [[World Professional Darts Championship|World Professional Championship]]. They are held annually over the Christmas/New Year period, with the PDC championship finishing slightly earlier than the BDO tournament. The [[BDO World Darts Championship|BDO World Championship]] has been running since 1978; the [[PDC World Darts Championship|PDC World Championship]] started in 1994.

Both organisations hold other professional tournaments. The BDO organise the [[Winmau World Masters|World Masters]] and many Open tournaments. They also organise county darts for their 66 [[Counties of the United Kingdom|county]] members in the UK including individual and team events.

The PDC's major tournaments are the [[PDC World Darts Championship|World Championship]], [[Premier League Darts|Premier League]], [[PDC UK Open Darts|UK Open]], [[Stan James World Matchplay|World Matchplay]], [[PDC World Grand Prix Darts|World Grand Prix]] and the [[Grand Slam of Darts]]. All of these are broadcast live on Sky Sports television in the UK. They also hold PDC Pro Tour events and smaller category events around the UK.

Two Dutch independently organised major tournaments, the [[International Darts League]] and the [[World Darts Trophy]] introduced a mix of BDO and PDC players in 2006 and 2007. Both organisations allocated rankings to the tournaments, but these two events are now discontinued.

The [[WDF World Cup darts|WDF World Cup]] for national teams and a singles tournament has been played biennially since 1977. The WDF also organise the Europe Cup.The [[Professional Darts Corporation|PDC]] has their own world cup competition, the [[PDC World Cup of Darts]].

===World rankings===
{{main article|Darts world rankings}}
Both the WDF, BDO and PDC each maintain their own rankings lists. These lists are commonly used to determine [[Single-elimination tournament#Seeding|seedings]] for various tournaments. The WDF rankings are based on the preceding 12 months performances, the BDO resets all ranking points to zero after the seedings for their world championship have been determined, and the [[PDC Order of Merit]] is based on prize money earned over a two-year period.

==Television==
Darts first appeared on British television in 1962 when [[Westward Television]] broadcast the Westward TV Invitational to the [[South West England|south-west of England]]. 1972 was a big year for darts when [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] started broadcasting the [[News of the World Darts Championship|News of the World Championship]]. Also in 1972 was the start of [[The Indoor League]], which featured a darts tournament, although it was only shown in the [[Yorkshire Television]] region in 1972. The Indoor League was shown across Britain on the ITV network from 1973 onwards. Over the next decade darts coverage expanded with many major tournaments appearing on both ITV and [[BBC]] through the 1970s and early 1980s to such as extent about 14 tournaments were covered. In 1978, the [[BDO World Darts Championship|World Championships]] started and were covered by the BBC, the BBC innovated with the split screen showing the throwing of the dart and where it hit the board. However the cancellation of ITV's [[World of Sport (UK TV series)|''World of Sport'']] show in 1985 meant they had to cut back on darts coverage but despite this they still showed the [[World Matchplay (darts)#Previous incarnation|MFI World Matchplay]] and the [[World Masters (darts)|World Masters]] until 1988. The BBC also cut back on their coverage after 1988 to such an extent that only one major event was still broadcast on either channel by 1989, the World Championship and this contributed in the split in darts.

With the creation of the WDC/PDC in 1992/93, darts gradually returned to television with Sky Television covering the new organization's World Championship and World Matchplay events from 1994. Sky's coverage continued to increase throughout the 1990s, with more new events added. The PDC's [[World Championship]], [[Premier League Darts|Premier League]], [[PDC UK Open Darts|UK Open]], [[Grand Slam of Darts]], [[Stan James World Matchplay|World Matchplay]] and the [[PDC World Grand Prix Darts|World Grand Prix]] are all televised live on Sky. The BDO held on to the contract with the BBC to continue with the BDO World Championship and this was the only tournament shown on free to air television in the UK between 1994 and 2001 apart from the showdown between PDC Champion Phil Taylor and BDO Champion Raymond van Barneveld in 1999 which was shown on ITV, BBC finally began to expand their darts coverage in 2001 when they added the World Masters to their portfolio. However, it wasn't until 2005 that viewers were able to see every dart thrown live at the World Championship. This was the year that BBC introduced interactive coverage on its [[BBC Red Button|BBCi]] service. BBC continued to cover the BDO tournament exclusively until 2012–2013 when ESPN UK started covering the evening sessions while BBC had afternoon session, after the acquisition of ESPN UK by BT Sport, BT dropped the Darts in 2014 but started covering the evening sessions again in 2015.  [[Setanta Sports]] also televised some BDO events in 2008–2009 and the inaugural League of Legends. Eurosport covered the BDO Finland Open, the BDO British Internationals, the BDO England Open and the BDO British Open in 2006–2007 but dropped coverage of these tournaments however they then returned to Darts in 2013 covering the Winmau World Masters, they have since expanded their coverage to cover the new BDO major the World Trophy from Blackpool and existing tournaments in the BDO such as the 6 Nations, England Open, Scottish Open and Northern Ireland Open.

[[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] returned to darts coverage in November 2007, showing the inaugural [[Grand Slam of Darts]] — its first major darts tournament coverage in almost twenty years. They continued covering this until 2010 when Sky Sports took over the rights, ITV also showed the European Championship in 2008 and Players Championship since its inception. ITV then increased its coverage in 2013 by signing a deal to cover 4 PDC tournaments per year, the Players Championship, European Championship, UK Open and new tournament the Masters and it was increased to 5 tournaments in 2015 to cover the World Series Finals.

Darts has continued to grow again on television and there now several major tournaments broadcast in the UK, Europe and the rest of the world. Dutch station, Sport One, DSF in Germany and several other TV stations across the globe also broadcast the PDC events. In Europe, [[Eurosport]] broadcast the Lakeside World Championships, having signed a three-year contract in 2006.

In the Netherlands, [[SBS6]] has broadcast the Lakeside (since 1998) and the Dutch Open. They also shown the [[International Darts League]] and [[World Darts Trophy]], however they are now defunct. [[RTL 5]] broadcast the Dutch Grand Masters in 2005. Some of these tournaments can also be watched on the internet for free using a live stream, depending on contractual restrictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sbs6.crossmediaventures.com/darts/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061104172654/http://sbs6.crossmediaventures.com/darts/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2006-11-04 |title=Darts |publisher=Sbs6.crossmediaventures.com |date= |accessdate=2015-05-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20061108072122/http://sbs6.crossmediaventures.com/darts2/ ]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sbs6.crossmediaventures.com/darts3/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070114005939/http://sbs6.crossmediaventures.com/darts3/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2007-01-14  |title=PDC World Championships |publisher=Sbs6.crossmediaventures.com |date= |accessdate=2015-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sbs6.crossmediaventures.com/darts4/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070113123625/http://sbs6.crossmediaventures.com/darts4/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2007-01-13  |title=Lakeside |publisher=Sbs6.crossmediaventures.com |date= |accessdate=2015-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sbs6.crossmediaventures.com/darts5/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070208203216/http://sbs6.crossmediaventures.com/darts5/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2007-02-08  |title=Dutch Open |publisher=Sbs6.crossmediaventures.com |date= |accessdate=2015-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The PDC has also tried to break into the television market in the [[United States]] by introducing the [[World Series of Darts (2006 tournament)|World Series of Darts]] in 2006. It had a $1 million prize to showcase professional darts in the [[United States]]. Unfortunately the programme was not a ratings success and was taken from its peak time broadcast slot on ESPN after just a few weeks. The tournament was replaced with a [[US Open Darts|US Open]] event in 2007 which was screened in the UK on digital television channel Challenge TV, with [[Nuts TV]] showing the 2008 tournament.

==Betting==
In places where [[alcoholic beverages]] are consumed, [[English law]] has long permitted [[gambling|betting]] only on [[game of skill|games of skill]], as opposed to [[game of chance|games of chance]], and then only for small stakes. An apocryphal tale relates that in 1908, Jim Garside, the landlord of the Adelphi Inn, [[Leeds, England]] was called before the local [[magistrate]]s to answer the charge that he had allowed betting on a game of chance, darts, on his premises. Garside asked for the assistance of local champion William "Bigfoot" Annakin who attended as a [[witness]] and demonstrated that he could hit any number on the board nominated by the court. Garside was discharged as the magistrates found darts, indeed, to be a game of skill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.patrickchaplin.com/Bigfoot.htm|title=Patrick Chaplin: The Facts In The Case of 'Bigfoot' Annakin|work=patrickchaplin.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.patrickchaplin.com/PhDBook.htm|title=Patrick Chaplin: Darts in England 1900–1939|work=patrickchaplin.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.justinirwin.com/dartsbook Murder on the darts board] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928072621/http://justinirwin.com/dartsbook/ |date=2013-09-28 }} {{cite book | title=Murder on the Darts Board | publisher=Anova Books | author=Irwin, Justin | year=2008 | page=123 | isbn=978-1-906032-04-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, in keeping with darts' strong association with pubs and drinking, matches between friends or pub teams are often played for pints of beer.

In the professional game, betting is prominent with many of the big [[bookmakers|bookmaking]] companies sponsoring events (particularly within the PDC). [[William Hill (bookmaker)|William Hill]], [[Unibet]], [[BetVictor]], [[Coral (bookmaker)|Coral]] and [[bwin]] are all title sponsors of major PDC events.

In the past when [[Fox Sports Net|Fox Sports]] broadcast tournaments in the United States, the logos for betting houses such as Ladbrokes were [[Pixelization|pixelated]] out and digitally obscured, along with any audible references to them, because of American laws and policies against [[online gambling]]; however other US broadcasters usually carry overseas darts tournaments without any edits other than for timing and narrative purposes, and Americans usually cannot visit the sites for betting houses outside of redirection pages.

'''ES Marks Athletics Field''' is located in [[Kensington, New South Wales|Kensington]], [[Sydney]], Australia. It was built in 1906 as Sydney Athletics Field. In 1947 a [[cinder track]] was installed and it was renamed ES Marks Athletics Field after athletics administrator [[Ernest Marks]]. In 1956 a grandstand was built. In the early 1960s, it hosted the Australian Athletics National Titles, however as the cinders track aged and alternate synthetic tracks at other venues were built, the facility fell out of favour.&lt;ref name=History&gt;[http://www.historyofsydney.com.au/es-marks-athletics-field/ ES Marks Athletics Field] History of Sydney&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s the track was resurfaced and electronic timing installed. The national championships returned in 1980. The [[New South Wales Waratahs]] and [[Sydney Roosters]] have used it at various times as training ground. In the lead up to the [[2000 Summer Olympics|2000 Sydney Olympics]], the field was used by the [[United States national athletics team]].&lt;ref name=History/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.centennialparklands.com.au/places_to_visit/es_marks_athletics_field About ES Marks Athletics Field] Centennial Park &amp; Moore Park Trust&lt;/ref&gt;

|title=Stadiums in Chile|publisher=Worldstadiums.com|accessdate=21 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was named in honor of [[Carlos Dittborn]], the president of the Chilean Organization Committee for the World Cup, who died one month prior to the start of the 1962 World Cup. It is the home stadium of [[San Marcos de Arica]].

The stadium held the matches of [[1962 FIFA World Cup Group 1|Group 1]] (consisting of Soviet Union, Yugoslavia, Uruguay, Colombia), as well as the second round match between Chile and Soviet Union. It witnessed the only Olympic goal (scored directly from a corner kick) in world cup history (as of 2018), scored by Colombian [[Marcos Coll]] against Russian goalkeeper [[Lev Yashin]].

[[File:Three point shoot.JPG|thumb|A shot from beyond the three-point line for a three-point field goal]]
In [[basketball]], a '''field goal''' is a basket scored on any shot or tap other than a [[free throw]], worth two or [[three-point field goal|three points]] depending on the distance of the attempt from the basket. Uncommonly, a field goal can be worth other values such as one point in [[FIBA]] [[3x3 basketball]] competitions or [[four-point field goal|four points]] in the [[BIG3]] basketball league. "Field goal" is the official terminology used by the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA) in their rule book, in their box scores and statistics, and in referees' rulings. The same term is also the official wording used by the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA) and [[basketball#High school basketball|high school basketball]].

[[Kareem Abdul-Jabbar]] holds the NBA record for field goals made in a career with 15,837. [[Wilt Chamberlain]], one of the most prolific scorers of all time, holds the top four spots for most field goals made in a season and has the two top [[field goal percentage]]s for a season. One of the greatest field-goal shooters of all time is [[Michael Jordan]], who led the NBA in field goals made ten times. [[Shaquille O'Neal]] has the record for most seasons (10) with the best field goal percentage, and [[Artis Gilmore]] has the record for highest career field goal percentage (59.9%).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nba.com/history/records/regular_fieldgoals.html NBA.com: Regular Season Records: Field Goals&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Steve Nash]] was one of the greatest all-around shooters in the history of the NBA, holding the record for [[50–40–90 club|50–40–90]] seasons, a mark of all-around shooting for two-point field goals, three-point field goals, and free throws. Nash recorded four of the eleven 50–40–90 seasons in NBA history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/n/nashst01.html |publisher=Basketball Reference |title=Steve Nash career statistics |accessdate=May 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One type of field goal is called a [[slam dunk]]. This occurs when a player jumps near the basket with possession of the ball, throwing the ball down through the basket while airborne. The word "slam" is derived onomatopoeically from the sound of the player's hands hitting, grabbing, then releasing the hoop.

The '''International Handball Federation''' ('''IHF''') is the administrative and controlling body for [[handball]] and [[beach handball]]. IHF is responsible for the organisation of handball's major international tournaments, notably the [[IHF World Men's Handball Championship]], which commenced in 1938, and the [[IHF World Women's Handball Championship]], which commenced in 1957.

IHF was founded in 1946 to oversee international competitions. Headquartered in [[Basel]], its membership now comprises 209 national federations. Each member country must each also be a member of one of the six regional confederations: [[African Handball Confederation|Africa]], [[Asian Handball Federation|Asia]], [[European Handball Federation|Europe]], [[North America and the Caribbean Handball Confederation|North America and Caribbean]], [[Oceania Continent Handball Federation|Oceania]], and [[South and Central America Handball Confederation|South and Central America]]. Dr. [[Hassan Moustafa]] from [[Egypt]] has been President of the IHF since 2000.

== History ==
The IHF was founded on July 11, 1946, in [[Copenhagen]] ([[Denmark]]) by representatives of eight national federations. The founding members were [[Danish Handball Federation|Denmark]], [[Finnish Handball Association|Finland]], [[French Handball Federation|France]], [[Norwegian Handball Federation|Norway]], [[Netherlands Handball Association|Netherlands]], [[Poland Handball Federation|Poland]], [[Swedish Handball Federation|Sweden]], and [[Swiss Handball Association|Switzerland]]. The first president of IHF was [[Gösta Björk]] from [[Sweden]]. Björk was replaced in 1950 by [[Hans Baumann (handball)|Hans Baumann]] from [[Switzerland]].
In 1954, the first [[IHF World Men's Handball Championship|IHF Men's World Championship]], was conducted under the aegis of the IHF, in Sweden with the participation of six national teams. In 1957, the first [[IHF World Women's Handball Championship]] was held in [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia |SFR Yugoslavia]] with the participation of nine national teams. Handball was included in the [[Olympic Games]] for the first time under the auspices of IHF in [[1972 Summer Olympics|Munich 1972]] (men's tournament) and [[1976 Summer Olympics|Montreal 1976]] (women's tournament).

==Structure==
===Laws and governance===
IHF is headquartered in [[Basel]], and is a federation established under the [[Law of Switzerland]].
IHF's supreme body is the [[IHF Congress]], an assembly made up of representatives from each affiliated member association. Each national handball association has one vote, regardless of its size or handballing strength. The Congress assembles in ordinary session once in two years (odd years) after the [[IHF World Men's Handball Championship]]. The congress makes decisions relating to IHF's governing statutes and their method of implementation and application. Only the Congress can pass changes to IHF's statutes. The congress approves the annual report, and decides on the acceptance of new national associations and holds elections. Congress elects the President of IHF, its General Secretary, and the other members of the [[IHF Council]].
IHF's Council, chaired by the President, is the main decision-making body of the organisation in the intervals of Congress. The Council is composed of 18 people: the President, 5 Vice Presidents, and 12 members. The Council is the body that decides which country will host the World Championship.
The President and General Secretary are the main officeholders of IHF, and are in charge of its daily administration, carried out by the General Secretariat. Dr. [[Hassan Moustafa]] is the current president, appointed in the year 2000 at the 28th Ordinary IHF Congress. 

===Six confederations and 209 national associations===
The IHF is composed of six continental federations which organize continental championships held every other second year: [[African Handball Confederation]], [[Asian Handball Federation]], [[European Handball Federation]], [[North America and the Caribbean Handball Confederation]], [[Oceania Continent Handball Federation]], and [[South and Central America Handball Confederation]]. In addition to continental competitions between national teams, the federations arrange international tournaments between club teams.&lt;ref name="ihf-rules-I"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ihf.info/upload/Manual/IHF_STATUTS_CHAP_01_GB.pdf|title=Bylaws|date=September 2007|publisher=International Handball Federation|page=7|accessdate=2 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until 2017, there were five continental confederations. On 14 January 2018, the IHF Council divided the Pan-American Confederation into the North America and the Caribbean Handball Confederation]] and the [[South and Central America Handball Confederation]]. The authority to divide a continental confederation was assigned to the IHF Congress, but the 36th IHF Congress in 2017 authorized the IHF Council to divide the Pan-American Federation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=IHF statement related to Pan-American continent |url=http://www.ihf.info/en-us/theihf/continentalfederations/europeanhandballfederation(ehf)/listoffederations/croatianhandballfederation/news/newsdetails.aspx?ID=5506 |publisher=IHF |date= 19 January 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="852">Umpires are a type of '''race official''' used in the running of sailing races run under the [[Racing Rules of Sailing]]. Their role is primarily linked to making on the water decisions about rule infringements during match racing events or rule 42 calls during fleet racing. Most racing is run without umpires and unresolved issues are dealt with after the racing finished in front of a panel called the '''protest committee'''. The [[International Sailing Federation]] helps train its member national authorities many of whom have a '''national umpires''' program.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5785">'''Julius Goldie Goldman''' (born September 22, 1910, in [[Mayesville]], [[South Carolina]], and died February 19, 2001, in [[Detroit]], Michigan) was a [[Canadians|Canadian]] [[basketball]] player.

A father of modern basketball, Canada's representative on the 1936 Olympic Basketball Rules Committee, Julius Goldman suggested the elimination of the basketball rule that called for a "jump ball" after every [[field goal (basketball)|field goal]]. The 1936 games marked basketball's first appearance in the Olympics. The Rules Committee agreed with Goldman (the lone objecting vote was that of basketball's creator [[Dr. James Naismith]]), and the game was forever changed.  This rule change has been credited with modernizing basketball; speeding up the pace of the game, increasing scoring and making teams with shorter centers more competitive.  In 1958, [[NCAA]] rules committee chairman [[Ed Steitz]] credited Goldman's rule change as the most radical change in the entire evolution of basketball.

Goldman was born in 1910 in Mayesville, South Carolina to [[Lithuania]]n immigrants Isaac and Rebecca Goldman.  The family moved to Canada when Julius was two. Goldman captained and was the leading scorer for the [[Windsor Ford V-8]]'s team that won Canada's 1935–36 national championship, qualifying them to represent Canada in the [[1936 Berlin Olympics]]. However, Goldman's U.S. citizenship made him ineligible to play for another country, so he was made an assistant coach and appointed Canada's representative to the Olympic Basketball Rules Committee.  The Canadian Basketball team won a silver medal, losing 19-8 to the USA in the muddy gold medal game in a driving rainstorm outdoors.

==Playing career==

Goldman was a four sport star (basketball, track, baseball and hockey) at [[W. D. Lowe High School]] (at that time Windsor-Walkerville Tech).  After high school, he crossed the border to attend [[Detroit Institute of Technology]] (Detroit Tech) from 1928-32.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishsports.net/BioPages/JuliusGoldman.htm|title=Jewish Sports: Julius Goldman}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was the national collegiate basketball scoring leader in 1932.  He was named the top student athlete and a legendary college player.  In total, Goldman's teams amassed 36 championships.

==Coaching/Officiating career==

From 1937 to 1950, Goldman was a math teacher, athletic director and basketball coach at his ''alma mater'' Detroit Tech. He led the basketball team to a 143-75 record.  For 43 years, he officiated basketball and football for the [[Detroit Catholic Schools Association]].

==Professional career==

Goldman worked for Smith, Hinchman &amp; Grylls in Detroit as a principal designer of ammunition.  An electrical engineer with a Master's degree in business engineering, Goldman designed and developed the 155&amp;nbsp;mm [[howitzer]] anti-tank shell during World War II that allowed the Allied Forces to turn the 1944 tide against Germany's "invincible" [[Tiger I|Tiger tanks]].  He later worked as an executive with both Federal Engineering and Fisher Body in Detroit, retiring in 1965.  He then resumed his teaching career at [[Oakland Community College]] in 1970, teaching math until he finally retired for good in 1995 at the age of 85.

==Personal life==

Goldman was married to Ann Goldman (née Warsh) (1913–1990).  They had two children; a son Alan (1940–2011) and daughter Nancy Kushkin (1944-   ), and seven grandchildren.

==Awards==
1950 - [[Mensa International|Mensa]] membership (98% or above on standardized IQ test)

1969 - Named "Official of the Year" (DCSA)

1973 - Named top student-athlete of the century (1872–1972) at W.D. Lowe Secondary School

'''Kiwitea Street''', also known as '''Freyberg Field''', is a multi-purpose [[stadium]] in the suburb of [[Sandringham, New Zealand|Sandringham]] in [[Auckland]], [[New Zealand]].  It is used for [[football (soccer)]] matches and is the home stadium of both [[Auckland City FC]] and [[Central United]]. Terraced seating can accommodate 250 patrons.

The stadium is named for [[Bernard Freyberg, 1st Baron Freyberg]].

Kiwitea Street was the venue of the [[2007 Chatham Cup]] final.

==History==

Initially, the Central club played their home games at either the [[Auckland Domain]] or the Oakley Ground in [[Waterview, New Zealand|Waterview]]. 
A move to a permanent home site came in 1965, when Freyberg Field, situated on the borders of the suburbs of [[Sandringham, New Zealand|Sandringham]] and [[Mount Albert, New Zealand|Mount Albert]] in Kiwitea Street, was made available for use as a football pitch, in spite of it being just forty-five metres wide.

The next quarter of a century saw Central increase the width of the pitch on three occasions, each time at club members' personal expense. 
The last such exercise took place in the late 1980s. After buying up adjoining properties, a massive timber retaining wall was erected, and 5000 cubic meters of earth was removed.

However, only six first-team games could be played at Kiwitea Street in 1992, due to its poor condition.

Following consultations with the Auckland City Council and the New Zealand Turf Culture Institute, a bold plan was implemented to develop an all-weather, sand carpeted pitch at Central – similar to those at [[Eden Park]] and the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground|MCG]] – over a three-year period. 
The final result saw Kiwitea Street boasting the finest football-playing surface in the country by 1995.

In addition to these extensive works the club has also undertaken further major developments at the ground including:

1. The construction of a covered grandstand in 2004; &lt;br/&gt;
2. Major additions to the clubrooms to incorporate a new boardroom, administration office, corporate hospitality wing and dedicated medical and physiotherapy room (2004–2007); &lt;br/&gt;
3. Further sand-slitting, sand-carpeting and a full resurfacing of the pitch in 2007.

'''Klöckner Stadium''' is home to four nationally recognized sports programs&amp;mdash;the [[University of Virginia]] men's and women's [[soccer]] teams in the fall and [[Virginia Cavaliers men's lacrosse|men's lacrosse]] and women's [[lacrosse]] teams in the spring. The stadium was designed by VMDO Architects and built in 1992 at a cost of $3.4 million, and its [[naming rights]] were awarded to the [[Klöckner|Klöckner Group]] of [[Germany]] for $1.2 million. The Virginia men's soccer team won national championships in the first three years they played at Klöckner, and including the year prior to the stadium's opening the string of national titles was four in a row. They have gone on to win numerous ACC championships while making Klöckner their home, including in 2003 and 2004, adding national championships in 2009 and 2014.

Additionally, both Virginia lacrosse teams have won national championships while at Klöckner&amp;mdash;1999, 2003, 2006, and 2011 for the men, and 1993 and 2004 for the women (who were also national runners-up in 2005 and 2007).

The fourth team playing at the stadium, women's soccer, participated in the 1991, 2013, and 2014 NCAA Final Fours.

The largest soccer crowd to see a game at Klöckner Stadium was on September 28, 2007, when 7,906 fans watched an [[Atlantic Coast Conference|ACC]] game against [[Virginia Tech Hokies|Virginia Tech]].&lt;ref name="Cap"&gt;{{cite web|title=Klockner Stadium Capacity Capped At 8,000|url=http://www.virginiasports.com/sports/m-lacros/spec-rel/040708aaa.html|website=Virginiasports.com|accessdate=21 April 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest lacrosse crowd was first seen on April 12, 2008, when a game against [[Duke University]] attracted the stadium capacity, 8,000 spectators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Duke Lacrosse Handles Virginia|url=http://www.nbc29.com/story/8158662/duke-lacrosse-handles-virginia|accessdate=21 April 2018|work=NBC29.com|date=12 April 2008|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Duke University]] returned to Klöckner Stadium on April 17, 2010 stadium capacity was reached again when 8,000 spectators entered the historic venue. As at [[Scott Stadium]], some spectators sit or stand in the grassy areas behind each goal, as well as in the bleachers.

During the 2006 soccer season, a video board was installed at Klöckner Stadium. It debuted on September 27, 2006, during a men's soccer game between Virginia and American University.

The ice hockey games from the [[1992 Winter Olympics]] were held at this arena.  After the Olympics the name of the arena changed to the '''Patinoire Olympique''' (Olympic Skating Rink), the capacity was reduced to 2,400, and part of the arena was converted into a [[swimming pool]], restaurant, and other uses.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3369">In [[cricket]], a [[batsman]] is '''not out''' if he comes out to bat in an [[innings]] and has not been [[dismissal (cricket)|dismissed]] by the [[end of an innings (Cricket)|end of the innings]]. The batsman is also ''not out'' while his innings is still in progress.

==Occurrence==
At least one batsman is not out at the end of every innings, because once ten batsmen are out, the eleventh has no partner to bat on with so the innings ends. Usually two batsmen finish not out if the batting side [[declaration (cricket)|declares]] in [[first-class cricket]], and often at the end of the scheduled number of overs in [[limited overs cricket]].  

Batsmen further down the [[batting order (cricket)|batting order]] than the not out batsmen do not come out to the crease at all and are noted as ''did not bat'' rather than ''not out''; by contrast, a batsman who comes to the crease but faces no balls is ''not out''.  A batsman who ''retires hurt'' is considered not out; an uninjured batsman who retires (rare) is considered ''[[retired out]]''.

==Notation==
In standard notation a batsman's score is appended with an [[asterisk]] to show the not out final status; for example, ''10*'' means '10 not out'.

==Impact on batting averages==
[[Batting average (cricket)|Batting averages]] are personal and are calculated as runs divided by dismissals, so a player who often ends the innings not out may get an inflated batting average, on the face of it.&lt;ref name="bbc4906060"/&gt; Examples of this include [[MS Dhoni]] (78 not outs in [[One Day International|ODIs]]), [[Michael Bevan]] (67 not outs in [[One Day International|ODIs]]), [[James Anderson (cricketer)|James Anderson]] (74 not outs in 189 [[Test cricket|Test]] innings), and [[Bill Johnston (cricketer)|Bill Johnston]] topping the batting averages on the [[Australian cricket team in England in 1953|1953 Australian tour of England]].&lt;ref name="bbc4906060"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/sports_talk/stump_bearders/4906060.stm|title=Stump the Bearded Wonder No 120|last=Frindall|first=Bill|date=13 April 2006|work=[[BBC Online]]|accessdate=8 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two independent counter-factors can mean the simple batting average formula understates performance:
*If not outs were counted as dismissals a usually high-scoring batsman could bat briefly. He may regularly make a low score, not out, facing a low number of balls from a [[bowler (cricket)|bowler]] and thus be penalised for factors out of his control.
*A batsman will tend to be at his most vulnerable early in his innings before he has "got his eye in"; as a result, it may be a greater achievement to achieve two scores of 20 not out and 20 (i.e. averaging 40) than to make one score of 40, since in the latter instance the batsman will only have had to deal with one set of variables (see [[ceteris paribus]], all things remaining approximately equal).

These counterbalancing elements have been at the heart of the rationale of keeping the existing simple formula in the 21st century among cricket statisticians, who have used this method of collecting batting averages since the 18th century, after some intervening controversy.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

'''Rackets''' or '''racquets''' is an indoor [[list of racket sports|racket sport]] played in the [[United Kingdom]], [[Ireland]], [[United States]], and [[Canada]]. The sport is infrequently called "hard rackets", possibly to distinguish it from the related sport of [[squash (sport)|squash]] (formerly called "squash rackets").

[[File:ToffRackets.jpg|right|thumb|200px|A Toff playing with the rabble in prison]]
[[File:KFRackets.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Rackets being played at a prison—where the game developed]]

Historians generally assert that rackets began as an 18th-century pastime in London's [[King's Bench Prison|King's Bench]] and [[Fleet Prison|Fleet]] [[debtors prison]]s. The prisoners modified the game of [[fives]] by using tennis rackets to speed up the action. They played against the prison wall, sometimes at a corner to add a sidewall to the game. Rackets then became popular outside the prison, played in alleys behind pubs. It spread to schools, first using school walls, and later with proper four-wall courts being specially constructed for the game. The lithograph at right from the late 1700s shows school boys 'hitting up' outside the [[Harrow School]] 'Old School' buildings.{{cn|date=April 2017}}

[[Eglinton Country Park|Eglinton Castle]] in Scotland, now largely demolished, had a "Racket Hall" which is first shown on the 1860 [[Ordnance Survey|OS map]], but estate records show that it was built shortly after 1839, the first recorded match being in 1846. The floor is of large granite slabs, now hidden by the wooden floor. It is the very first covered racket court and is now the oldest surviving court in the world, as well as being the oldest indoor sports building in Scotland. It has been restored as a racket hall, but used as an exhibition area.&lt;ref&gt;Eglinton Archives, Eglinton Country Park.{{full|date=April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{cn|date=April 2017}} Some private clubs also built courts. Along with [[real tennis]] and [[badminton]], rackets was used as an inspiration for the game of [[tennis|lawn tennis]], invented in 1873 by [[Walter Clopton Wingfield]]. A vacant rackets court built into the University of Chicago's [[Stagg Field]] served as [[Chicago Pile-1|the location]] of the first artificial [[nuclear chain reaction]] on December 2, 1942. The Stagg Field court is often mistakenly identified as having been a "squash rackets" court.{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}} Rackets was part of the [[1908 Summer Olympics]] program and was played at the [[Prince's Club]] in London.{{cn|date=April 2017}}

After the second world war rackets saw a drop in popularity resulting in the closure of some courts and others suffering from a lack of maintenance. Dick Bridgeman, an advocate for the sport (and later a British Doubles Champion) established what was then the Dick Bridgeman Tennis and Rackets Foundation. The foundation sought donations to support young professionals thereby ensuring the future of the game.  Now known as simply The Tennis and Racquets Foundation, it continues to raise money for young professionals raising the profile of rackets worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tennisandrackets.com/general-dbtraf-charitable-support.aspx|title=DBTRAF Charitable Support - Tennis &amp; Rackets Association|author=|date=|work=tennisandrackets.com|accessdate=7 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Book of Racquets'' was published by J. R. Atkins in 1872. It was reprinted to commemorate the 1981 World Rackets Challenge Match between W. J. C. Surtees and J. A. N. Prenn as a limited edition of 250 copies.&lt;ref&gt;Atkins, J. R. (1872). ''The Book of Racquets. A Practical Guide to the Game and its History and to the different Courts in which it is played.''

[[File:Rackets Court layout.png|thumb|100px|A racket court layout]]

Rackets is played in a {{convert|30|by|60|ft|adj=on}} enclosed court, with a ceiling at least {{convert|30|ft}} high. Singles and doubles are played on the same court. The walls and floor of the court are made of smooth stone or concrete and are generally dark in colour to contrast with the white ball. A player uses {{convert|30.5|in|cm|adj=on}} wooden racket, known as a bat, to hit a 38&amp;nbsp;mm (1.5&amp;nbsp;inch) hard white ball weighing 28&amp;nbsp;grams. As of September 2018, two companies produce rackets bats, Grays of Cambridge (UK) and [http://www.goldleafathletics.com Gold Leaf Athletics] (US).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://squash.as/grays/history.php |title=Lysaker Squash |author= |date=6 July 2011 |work=archive.org |accessdate=7 April 2017 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706085116/http://squash.as/grays/history.php |archivedate=6 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  

A good stroke must touch the front wall above a {{convert|26.5|in|cm}} high wooden (often cloth-covered) board before touching the floor. The ball may touch the side walls before reaching the front wall.  The player returning a good stroke may play the ball on the volley, or after one bounce on the floor.  The play is fast, and potentially dangerous. Lets (replayed points) are common, as the striker should not play the ball if doing so risks hitting another player with it.  Matches preferably are observed by a "marker", who has the duty to call "Play" after each good stroke to denote that the ball is "up".  Games are to 15 points, unless the game is tied at 13–all or 14–all, in which case the game can be "set" to 16 or 18 (in the case of 13–all) or to 15 or 17 (in the case of 14–all) at the option of the player first reaching 13 or 14. Only the server (hand-in) can score—the receiver (hand-out) who wins a rally becomes the server. Return of service can be extremely difficult, and, in North America, only one serve is allowed. Matches are typically best of five games.{{cn|date=April 2017}}

The main shots played are the volley, forehand and the backhand all similar to the way one plays these in squash; because the game of [[squash rackets]] (now known as "squash") began in the 19th century as an offshoot of rackets, the sports were similar in manner of play and rules. However, the rules and scoring in squash have evolved in the last hundred years or so. Rackets has changed little; the main difference today is that players are now allowed brief rest periods between games. In the past, leaving the court could mean forfeiting the match, so players kept spare rackets, shirts, and shoes in the gutter below the telltale on the front wall.{{cn|date=April 2017}}

The governing bodies are the [[Tennis and Rackets Association]] (UK) and the [[North American Racquets Association]].{{cn|date=April 2017}}

As of this date,{{when?|date=April 2017}} there are eight active courts in North America, all at private clubs:{{cn|date=April 2017}}

====Two court venues====
* [[Chicago]]. The [[Racquet Club of Chicago]] has two courts. Opened in 1924, with a Court Tennis and two double squash courts.  The courts are in exceptional condition, and have hosted the prestigious Western Open and other tournaments multiple times. The lobby of the courts contains plaques with the names of yearly winners going back to 1924.  This club is open to both Men and Women and features many other gym facilities.  It is known as one of the most exclusive clubs in the Chicago area.  There are multiple dining and social areas, including a [[billiards]] room for social events.{{cn|date=April 2017}}

====One court venues====
* [[Detroit]].  The [[Detroit Racquet Club]], also referred to as the DRC, opened in 1902 as the 'Detroit Racquet and Curling Club'. The building was designed by the noted architect [[Albert Kahn (architect)|Albert Kahn]], and was built by the construction company owned by Joseph Bickley; its two original [[curling]] lanes were sold off during the Great Depression. The DRC is a proper [[Gentlemen's club]],{{what?|date=April 2017}} and hosts three additional North American squash courts. The Rackets court was originally open to the air with natural lighting until it was glazed over with lights added in 1912. The home colors are dark [[navy blue]] and white.{{cn|date=April 2017}}

: The  club is reportedly the origin to the cocktail the [[stinger (cocktail)|stinger]] which has been a mainstay at the club since opening.{{cn|date=April 2017}}

* [[Montreal]]. The first court was built in 1825. The Montreal Rackets Club (founded in 1889) is the oldest in existence according to [[Alastair Bruce, 5th Baron Aberdare]], whose father won the championship there in 1930. The court was constructed four feet longer and two feet wider to facilitate doubles play. It was resized to regulation 60 by 30 feet in 1909. Yearly, North American clubs host a male guest from British boarding schools known as a "fellow" who usually is between the age of 18 and 19. The fellow program lasts three to four months. The fellowship program allows young men from Britain to experience the United States clubs (there is an active court in Montreal). Normally these men travel to all the North American clubs to play in tournaments. Their duties include being an unpaid teacher of the sport to wrapping and trimming Rackets balls.{{cn|date=April 2017}}

* [[New York City|New York]], NY. The New York [[Racquet and Tennis Club]] opened in 1918 on Park Avenue, the building designed by [[McKim, Mead &amp; White]]. The building originally housed two courts: one was converted to a double squash court in 1956.  It is one of the remaining large clubs with a male only policy. The first court in the City was built in 1850 by a wine merchant from Montreal, Mr E.H. Lamontagne. The Racket and squash professional is Mr. James Stout, who is the current world champion.{{cn|date=April 2017}}

* [[Philadelphia]]. Opened in 1907 with three courts, one of which now has been converted to a double squash court, and another to a single squash court, at The Racquet Club of Philadelphia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rcop.com/athletics.php#rackets] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120108100243/http://www.rcop.com/athletics.php |date=2012-01-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Tuxedo Park, New York|Tuxedo Park, NY]]. Opened in 1902.  The Tuxedo Park courts are part of a large private [[gated community]] which hosts many tournaments bringing in players from all around the world.{{cn|date=April 2017}}

* [[Boston]], MA. The [[Boston Tennis and Racquet Club]] opened in 1902 in Boston's [[Back Bay]] in a building designed by [[Parker and Thomas]] in the [[neoclassicism|classical revival]] style and built by Frank L. Whitcomb.

The [[Rackets World Championships]] for singles (and doubles) is decided in a challenge format. If the governing bodies accept the challenger's qualifications, he plays the reigning champion in a best of 14 games format (best of seven games on each side of the Atlantic). If each player wins seven games, the total point score is used as a tie breaker. The current singles champion is [[James Stout (rackets)|James Stout]]. The current doubles champions are amateurs James Stout &amp; Jonathan Larken, who beat World Title holders, Alex Titchener-Barrett and Christian Portz in a two-legged challenge in November 2016. The first leg was played in London's Queen's Club, and was won by the challengers 4 games to 1. The second occurred in The New York Racquet's and Tennis Club, and was also won by the challengers 2 games to 1, reaching a two match aggregate of six games.

The tournament system for Rackets is being revolutionised by a new World Ranking System, developed by Richard Spender and ex-New York professional, James Beaumont. The scheme is on a year experiment with the Tennis &amp; Rackets Association.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tennisandrackets.com/rackets-rankings.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-01-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090202101459/http://tennisandrackets.com/rackets-rankings.html |archivedate=2009-02-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The development of the rankings model and the online system has been sponsored by Robinson McColl Architects+Designers, founded by former doubles World Champion, Alister Robinson.

There are various tournaments that are hosted in North America and the UK.

'''India''''s history in '''rowing''' dates back to the British era. The first club, the [[Calcutta Rowing Club]] was founded in 1858. The [[Rowing Federation of India]] administers the sport in the country. India's first ever [[Asian Games]] gold medal was won by [[Bajrang Lal Takhar]] in 2010&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2010-11-19/news/27569975_1_pratima-puhana-south-asian-games-silver-medals |title=Asian Games: India wins first ever rowing gold |publisher=Articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com |date=2010-11-19 |accessdate=2012-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the country has never won an [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] medal in the sport.

The {{nihongo|'''Sapporo Dome'''|札幌ドーム|Sapporo Dōmu}} is a [[stadium]] located in [[Toyohira-ku, Sapporo]], [[Japan]], and is primarily used for [[baseball]] and [[association football]]. It is the home field of the baseball team [[Hokkaido Nippon-Ham Fighters]] and the association football club [[Hokkaido Consadole Sapporo]]. It is one of the planned [[football at the 2020 Summer Olympics|football]] venues for the [[2020 Summer Olympics]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Venue Plan|url=http://tokyo2020.jp/en/plan/venue/index.html|publisher=Tokyo 2020 Bid Committee|accessdate=11 September 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130727040849/http://tokyo2020.jp/en/plan/venue/index.html|archivedate=27 July 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; was the venue for the opening ceremony of the [[2017 Asian Winter Games]], and is a planned venue of the [[2019 Rugby World Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World Rugby approves revised Japan 2019 hosting roadmap|url=http://www.rugbyworldcup.com/news/101763|publisher=World Rugby|accessdate=22 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stadium was previously a venue of the [[2002 FIFA World Cup]].

==History==
[[File:SapporoDome2004-2.jpg|thumb|Sapporo Dome in Winter]]
The Sapporo Dome opened in 2001 with 41,580 seats.  This stadium hosted 3 games during the [[2002 FIFA World Cup]], [[Germany national football team|Germany]] vs [[Saudi Arabia national football team|Saudi Arabia]], [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] vs [[England national football team|England]] and [[Italy national football team|Italy]] vs [[Ecuador national football team|Ecuador]]; all three matches were in the first round.

The Dome hosted the opening ceremonies to the [[2007 FIS Nordic World Ski Championships]] on February 22 and hosted the closing ceremonies of the championships on March 4. It also made history as being the first venue where both indoor and nighttime skiing events took place for the first time on a world championship or [[Winter Olympic Games]] level with competitions in the [[cross country skiing]] sprints (men's and women's individual, and men's and women's team) and the cross country portion of the 7.5&amp;nbsp;km sprint event in the [[nordic combined]]. In order to generate snow, the stadium used its turf conversion hovering system to facilitate the snow making process for the skiing competitions.&lt;ref name=fisjan07&gt;FIS Newsflash Edition 112. January 31, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The opening ceremony featured [[Maki Ohguro]], a local artist from Sapporo, Japanese drum demonstrations and other performances paying tributes to local customs and traditions.&lt;ref name=fisjan07 /&gt; For the championships, [[seating capacity]] was reduced to 30,000.&lt;ref name=fisjan07 /&gt;

The Dome was used as a [[super special stage]] in Rally Japan in both [[2008 Rally Japan|2008]] and  [[2010 Rally Japan|2010]].

In late 2009, renovations with the possibility of increasing the capacity up to 53,796 were finished. These renovations also included space for more food outlets, an extra video screen, two extra changing rooms (to accommodate preseason matches in the [[NFL]] [[NFL International Series|International Series]], which have up to 75 players per team) and further media area as part of new office buildings attached to the stadium. As part of these renovations, the surface area of the arena itself was decreased to allow for more seating.

==Retractable surface==
[[File:Sapporo Dome moving pitchjpg.jpg|thumb|Retractable grass field shown outside the stadium]]
The Dome  switches between two entirely different surfaces: Baseball games are played on an underlying artificial turf field, while [[football (soccer)|football]] games are held on a grass pitch that slides into and out of the stadium as needed.

Conversion from baseball to football begins with the storage of the baseball field's artificial turf.  Once finished, a set of lower bowl bleachers rotate from an angled position for baseball to a parallel position.  A set of main bowl seats on one end of the [[dome]] then retracts, and the football pitch is slid into the stadium.  The lower bowl is then rotated 90 degrees.  Conversion from football to baseball occurs in reverse. Due to the retraction of seats, the Stadium has a capacity of 40,476 for baseball games.

Other stadiums that feature sliding pitches include the [[GelreDome]] in the [[Netherlands]], [[Veltins-Arena]] in [[Germany]] and [[State Farm Stadium]] in the [[United States]]; however, unlike these three facilities, the Sapporo Dome has a fixed roof.

The '''Sustainable Fisheries Act of 1996''' is an amendment to the [[Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act]], a law governing the management of marine [[fisheries]] in the [[United States]]. Another major amendment to this legislation was later made under the ''Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Reauthorization Act of 2006''. The SFA was enacted to amend the outdated MSFCMA of 1976. The amendment included changes to the purpose of the act, definitions, and international affairs, as well as many small changes.

The U.S. Senate [[Bill (law)|bill]] S. 39 was passed by the 104th United States Congressional session and enacted into law by the [[Presidency of Bill Clinton|42nd President of the United States]] Bill Clinton on October 11, 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=52088 |title= William J. Clinton: "Statement on Signing the Sustainable Fisheries Act," October 11, 1996 |author1=Peters, Gerhard |author2=Woolley, John T |publisher = University of California - Santa Barbara |work= The American Presidency Project}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==
There were several major changes to the purpose of the law: 
# Prohibiting fisheries managers from using social, economic, or any other justifications to allow catch targets to exceed a calculated "maximum sustainable yield."
# Mandating that for each managed species, fisheries managers quantitatively define "[[overfishing]]" (certain specified maximum allowed rates of fishing mortality) and "overfished" (depletion below a certain population level).
# Mandating regular assessment of which fish populations that are overfished, and creating an official list of overfished species in U.S. waters.
# Mandating that for overfished species, plans must be enacted allowing them to recover to quantitatively specified target population levels (usually about one-third of the estimated pre-fishing population) within ten years (with certain exceptions).
# Adding that catches of unintended species or unmarketable fish be reduced, to the extent practicable.
# Adding the promotion of protection of "Essential Fish Habitat."
# Adding the promotion of catch and release programs to conservation and management principles.

==Definitions==
The following terms which became relevant in the twenty years following the original act were added:
* [[bycatch]]
* charter fishing
* [[commercial fishing]]
* economic [[discards]]
* essential fish habitat
* [[fishing community]]
* [[individual fishing quota]]
* optimum yield
* [[overfishing]] (overfished)
* Pacific Insular Area
* [[recreational fishing]]
* regulatory discards
* special areas
* vessel subject to the jurisdiction of the United States

==International affairs==
Besides establishing the Pacific Insular Area fishery agreement regulations, the SFA directs the Secretary of State to "seek to secure an international agreement to establish standards and measures for bycatch reduction that are comparable to the standards and measures applicable to United States fishermen."

The '''Texas Softball Hall of Fame''' was founded in 1985 by [[Ralph Hall, Jr.]], in the [[Houston, Texas]] area in the [[United States]]. The Texas Softball [[Hall of Fame]] has produced over 869 tournaments, 729 leagues, and 1,607 events since its founding. It has also awarded over 19,300 champions, and directed more than 2,015,000 participants. They have played adult slow-pitch [[softball]] games at 30 different locations and on 70 different fields in and around the Houston area. Ralph Hall is a writer of "Ralph Said What?" and of numerous thoughts on softball and [[baseball]]. Ralph Said What? can be compared to a [[Yogi Berra]] type of humor.

==Ralph said what?==
Here is a small sample.

*More teams get beat by alcohol and by themselves than by the other teams.
*When you come to the fork in the road, be sure to clean it well before you eat with it.
*My deliverer is coming, but He isn't carrying a pizza.
*Do ump to others as you would have them do ump to you.
*We work. You Play.
*If you respect our history and care about our presence, you may wear the trophy of honor in our future.
*The tasks ahead of us are never as great as the power within us.
*We do not invite the great teams to humble the rest. We invite the humble to become great.
*Hall things are possible and winning the future is one of those possibilities.
*Never stop connecting with the One who gave you your dreams. To follow Him is more important than to follow your dreams.

'''Valencian pilota''' ({{lang-ca-valencia|pilota valenciana}} {{IPA-ca|piˈlɔta valensiˈana|}} "Valencian ball") is a traditional handball [[sport]] played in the [[Valencian Community]].&lt;ref name="història"&gt;{{citation|url=http://fedpival.es/historia/completa|title=History of the Valencian Pilota|work=[[Federació de Pilota Valenciana]]|language=ca|accessdate=5 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its origins are not known.

[[File:Trinquet-Eliana02.jpg|right|thumb|Valencian pilota match]]

Rules variations within the generic ''Pilota Valenciana'' category are frequent from area to area but the common trait is that the ball is struck with a bare, or almost bare, hand (only minimal protection is applied in some versions of the sport). The general rule involves two teams made from two up to five players each (the numbers depend on the particular version played). Exceptionally, individual matches are also played (mostly in [[Escala i corda]] and [[Raspall]]) between the most renowned players.

The second characteristic is that it is not played against a wall. Instead, similar to modern tennis, two individuals or teams are placed face to face separated either by a line on the ground or a net in all of modern modalities except for the [[frontó]].
A distinctive trait of Valencian pilota is that the spectators are often seated or standing very close to the court which means that they may be hit by the ball and thus become an (unwilling) part of the game.

== History ==
[[Image:Joc de pilota, de Josep Bru i Albinyana.jpg|250px|right|thumb|"''Joc de pilota''", 1881, [[llargues]].]]
The origins of Valencian pilota are not known with certainty, but it is commonly supposed to have been derived from the medieval [[Jeu de paume]] along with several other European handball sports (for example the [[Basque pelota|Basque]] ''laxoa'', French [[Longue paume]], [[Frisian handball]] and Italian [[Pallone]]) similar to the actual Valencian [[llargues]] variant.

''Jeu de paume'' is documented at [[Paris]] in 1292 since there were 13 ball workshops and many ''tripots'' (courtfields); it was first played with the hands, and the scoring system was very similar to the current Valencian one. There were so many resemblances with the ''Valencian pilota'' sport that, in the 16th century, the [[Humanism|humanist]] [[Joan Lluís Vives]] compared both games in his ''Dialogues'' and claimed them to be exactly the same despite some minor differences.

[[Image:Benissanó 1925.jpg|right|thumb|[[Escala i corda]] match, 1925]]
Being played by low-class people and high-class nobles, ''Valencian pilota'' was very popular: On June 14, 1391 the [[Valencia, Spain|Valencia City]] ''Council'' fruitlessly forbade it to be played on the streets, but this caused the expansion of [[Valencian trinquet|trinquets]] (courtfields); there were as many as 13 in that city alone in the 16th century. Later on, nobles abandoned the handball game in favour of '"'cleaner''" sports and so ''pilota'' became the property of the middle and lower classes, which led to the appearance of the first professional players and the rise of gambling and challenge matches.&lt;ref name="història" /&gt;

The break between indoor and outdoor forms caused many variants to diverge from the original [[Llargues]] version. Thus ''Perxa'' evolved into [[Galotxa]], and which in turn gave rise to [[Escala i corda]], while [[Raspall]] was still played in both courtfields. It should be noted that ''llargues'' is the only variant that uses the original "''ratlles''" rule, the others using a net to separate two sides on the playing area (as ''galotxa'', and ''escala i corda''), or with no court division at all (''raspall''). Another case is the [[Valencian frontó|Frontó]] variety, which was first documented in the late 19th century, influenced by the popularity of the main [[Basque pelota]] variant, which involves players throwing the ball against a wall.

[[Image:Llosa de Ranes-Raspall.JPG|right|thumb|[[Raspall]] match, 2007]]
Nowadays, ''Valencian pilota'' is played in the whole [[Valencian Community]], but every area has its preferred variety. Professional players of [[Escala i corda]] and [[Raspall]] are hired to play at the [[List of Valencian trinquets|trinquets]] or in streets during the towns' festivals. The popularity of this sport is rising again with the building of new cortifields at schools, weekly broadcasts on [[Canal Nou|Valencian public TV]], the management of a professional company ([[ValNet]]) and the [[Handball International Championships]] with countries where these sports with a common origin are played.

== Playing area ==
There are two basic versions of the sport depending whether it is played outdoors in a designated street or indoors.

*Variations of the game played in the street are [[Galotxa]], [[Llargues]] and [[Raspall]]. The streets must be long and wide (''Llargues'' or "longs" is the one which needs the most elongated playing ground). If the streets have some irregularities, such as balconies, lights, sidewalks, traffic signals, etc., they may be used in order to score. Some municipalities have built "fake streets" which look like real ones but are meant only for pilota games.
*As for the ones played indoors there are:
** [[Frare]]: Is a short Valencian ''frontó'' with bevels on the corners that cause the ball to bounce unexpectedly. Mostly played in the North of the [[Castellón (province)|Castelló province]].
** [[Valencian frontó|Frontó]]: Valencian ''frontons'' {{convert|20| to| 30|m|ftin|adj=on}} long courts with a {{convert|6|m|adj=on}} high wall, ''frontis'', against which the players bounce the ball off a rear wall where the ball may be bounced as well and another wall at the left of the players. The ''frontis'' has a {{convert|1|m|adj=on}} high line which marks the lowest point where a [[bouncing ball]] may hit.
** [[Galotxetes]]: Played in a {{convert|20|x|3.5| m|ftin|adj=on}} space with a {{convert|1|m|adj=on}} high net in the middle.  On the four corners there are open holes resembling doors where points are scored. Now it is only played in the [[Vinalopó Mitjà]] [[comarca]], but the oldest court still in use dates from 1772 in [[Abdet]] ([[Marina Baixa]]). &lt;br /&gt;[[Image:Trinquete Pedreguer.jpg|right|thumb|[[Valencian trinquet|Trinquet]] ready for an [[Escala i corda]] game]]
** [[Valencian trinquet|Trinquet]]: There is a {{convert|60|x|10|m|ftin|adj=on}} four walled court with stairs (''escala'') on one side for the spectators to sit. There are also two galleries over each of the ''frontons'' (shortest walls) for people to sit. There is a bottom balcony (''llotgeta'') where reputed people or professional betters may sit, similar to a box in other stadiums. Next to the ''llotgeta'' a square is drawn on the ground: the ''dau'', where players start the game. In order to play [[Escala i corda]] rules a {{convert|2|m||adj=on}} high net (''corda'') must be placed in the middle of the court. One of the most reputed is the [[Pelayo trinquet]] in [[Valencia, Spain|Valencia]]. See also the [[List of Valencian trinquets]].

== Variations ==
With the basic set of rules for either street or indoor ''pilota'', there are many different variations, some of them are played only locally, but most of them are played in wider areas. The only modalities with professional players are [[Escala i corda]] and [[Raspall]].

Another way to categorize variations is whether they are ''direct'' or ''indirect''. The '''direct games''' are those whose players are opposed face-to-face in different sides of the court, which is sometimes divided by a net; the '''indirect games''' are those with a wall where both teams throw the ball from a shared court. The traditional variations of ''Pilota Valenciana'' are direct, even though recently some indirect games ("Frontó" and "Frares") have been introduced based on the [[Basque Pelota]].

=== Direct games ===
[[Image:TrofeuNadal-06.jpg|right|thumb|Escala i corda]]

*[[File:Foto Jugadors IES Maritim.jpg|thumb]]'''[[Escala i corda]]''': A more prestigious game and (alongside Raspall) the only one played professionally. It is played in a [[Valencian trinquet|trinquet]] where a 1.8m high net is placed in the middle of the field. The ball must be thrown between players over the net, but can be aimed anywhere, mostly to special places such as the ''galeries'' or the ''llotgeta'' where a direct point is scored.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.pilotavalenciana.com/CircuitPortada0607.html |title=Circuit Bancaixa 2006/07 |access-date=2007-01-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070310233232/http://www.pilotavalenciana.com/CircuitPortada0607.html |archive-date=2007-03-10 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Galotxa]]''': This can be played in both regular streets or fake streets built solely for playing. The game resembles ''Escala i corda'' but with two nets and many more tricks, such as using irregularities in the street (like bumps or existing features from daily life like traffic signs) to score.
* '''[[Galotxetes]]''': Now it's only played in [[Monòver]], [[Pinoso]] and [[La Romana, Alicante|La Romana]], all in the [[Vinalopó Mitjà]] [[comarca]], similar to ''Escala i corda'' but shorter and with a different ball.
[[Image:Pilota de llargues a Sant Joan d'Alacant 3.jpg|right|thumb|[[Llargues]] game at [[Sant Joan d'Alacant]]]]
* '''[[Llargues]]''': This version can only be played in regular streets. It's said to be the oldest game. There is no net or field separating the teams. Each point is won twice: The first time the ball is stopped a ''ratlla'' (line) is marked on the ground. The second time the ball is stopped it has been thrown over that ''ratlla,'' the point is won by the sender.
* '''[[Raspall]]''': Similar to ''Escala i corda'' as it's played in a ''trinquet'', but without any net and the ball may bounce as many times as needed. Since players are forced to play stooped many times, it is considered the hardest variation to play. For example, ''Escala i corda'' games are won by the team who gets 60 points, but ''Raspall'' are played until 40.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pilotavalenciana.com/RaspallBancaixa2006.htm One-on-one 2006 League]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Indirect games ===
* '''[[Frare]]'''
* '''[[Valencian fronto|Frontó]]'''

== International games ==

=== Llargues, international game and fronton ===
The only Valencian pilota variety played outside the Valencian community is [[Llargues]]. Every year a European championship is held by the [[International Ball game Confederation]] with players from Valencia, [[Belgium]], [[France]], [[Italy]], and the [[Netherlands]]. There is also a world championship with those teams plus [[Argentina]], [[Colombia]], [[Mexico]] and [[Peru]].

The [[Handball International Championships]] combine local handball variations from all over Europe to create the "[[international game]]" using the shared traits from all the sports related or derived from the ''jeu de paume''. Valencian professional players do not need much adaptation, since ''Llargues'' is very close to the international rules.

Another case is the [[international fronton]], another invented variety that takes back the ''indirect style'' to its basics: one wall where the ball must bounce.

=== Relationship with Basque pelota ===
From the [[Basque Pelota]] modalities played in the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]] the ones called "bote luzea", "mahi jokoa" are extinct but, by all accounts they were extremely similar to what has been preserved in Valencian Pilota as [[Llargues]], but using a bigger and heavier ball.

An example of the compatibility there used to be between Valencian ''Llargues'' and Basque ''a la larga'' modalities was the existence during the 19th century of a sort of early professional side to the sport, with players from elsewhere earning high amounts of money, such as [[Aragon]]ese Lagasa and [[Valencian Community|Valencian]] Amigó, who, for example, toured in [[Navarre]] during September 1680.

In October 2006, for the first time, a Navarrese youth team played ''Llargues'' against a Valencian one during the "Pilota Day" celebrated in [[Valencia, Spain|Valencia]] (in the adult match, the Valencian community team played [[Frisian handball|the Frisian team from the Netherlands]]). At the moment the only exchanges between both sports are friendly matches of [[Valencian frontó|Frontó]], which is the main modality for Basques but a mostly irrelevant one for Valencians. In summer, or for special events, exhibition matches are organized, as the "Open Ciutat de València", with particular rules (such as the length of the court), and balls of intermediate size and diameter (70 gr.) between the kinds that both regions are accustomed to.

=== 1992 Summer Olympics ===
The Valencian pilota was a [[demonstration sport]] in the [[1992 Summer Olympics]] hosted in [[Barcelona]].

== Balls ==
[[Image:Pilotes.jpg|right|thumb|Left to right: [[Vaqueta ball|Vaqueta]], badana, tec and galotxetes balls. Below left is a leather glove]]
Every version of the game uses its own kind of ball. Each kind is different in weight, size, the way it bounces and other aspects. They are all handmade by specialized crafters.
* '''Badana ball''': Used for [[Llargues]], it is a soft ball which can be played without any protection, since llargues are played on the streets. The bounce is very irregular, causing the ball to be almost incapable of regular bouncing. It is made of rags and sheep skin, and usually weighs 39&amp;nbsp;grams with a diameter of 38&amp;nbsp;mm.
* '''Galotxetes ball''': Used only for [[Galotxetes]], it is very big and heavy, but it can be played without protection. It cannot bounce. It is made of rags with sticking pasters. It weighs 60&amp;nbsp;grams with a diameter of 70&amp;nbsp;mm.
* '''Tec ball''': Used for [[Valencian frontó]], it is a very fast bouncing ball. Because it is very hard, protection is required. The ball takes its name from its characteristic sound. It is made of wood, and covered with goat skin. The ball usually weighs 48-50&amp;nbsp;grams and has a diameter of 50&amp;nbsp;mm.
* '''[[Vaqueta ball]]''': Used for [[Escala i corda]] and [[Raspall]], it is a very fast ball and bounces well. Players must wear protective equipment. It is made of wood and covered with leather. It weighs 40-42&amp;nbsp;grams and has a diameter of 42&amp;nbsp;mm.

== Betting ==
Betting is inherent to the sport in its professional version and it is arguably the main factor which has kept the game alive, unlike similar games played elsewhere which ended up fading away. This is because betting allows professional players to exist, which creates rivalries and increases the entertaining dimension of the sport for the audience. Spectators of Valencian pilota can bet on one of the two sides, and the [[Valencian trinquet|trinquets]] and the [[Bookmaker|''marxador'']] gets a commission from these bets.

The two teams dress either with red or blue shirts. Bets are made for one color (red or blue) winning, for a certain margin of victory points, or for an expected way to score each particular point.

Remarkably high amounts of money may be bet during relevant games involving famous players. The more famous players become, the more betting is involved and so their personal revenue.

== Players ==
''Valencian pilota'' players are called ''pilotaris'' or ''pilotaires''. Usually amateur players are only proficient in one variant, but professional players tend to be hired for social events and exhibitions in other variants. There are now only two variants with professional players: [[Escala i corda]] and [[Raspall]].

Traditionally, each player managed his own agenda and arranged his fees, but in 2005 a new company, [[ValNet]], presided over by the retired pilotari [[Alfred Hernando|Fredi]] contracted almost all professional players.

[[File:SOME OF THE MALE RESIDENTS OF THE CENTURY VILLAGE RETIREMENT COMMUNITY MEET EACH EVENING TO PLAY WATER-VOLLEYBALL IN... - NARA - 548575.jpg|thumb]]

'''Water volleyball''' (also called '''pool and acqua volleyball''') is a competitive middle-court oriented water game.&lt;ref&gt;Cosmo, Lepota L (2017). The Practice of Water Volleyball as a Leisure and Fine Recreational Water Sport. ''Health Research'', I (1): 1-15. [https://dx.doi.org/10.31058/j.hr.2017.11001 doi:10.31058/j.hr.2017.11001] &lt;/ref&gt;It can be played between two teams, each team consisting of 1 to 4 players, depending on the area of water in which the game is being played.

== History ==

Water volleyball has emerged from [[recreational]] [[Swimming pool|pool activities]], sports, [[Sports club|aquatic clubs]], [[water parks]], through the practice of unification of the [[Tournament|beach and water tournaments]]. In the 1990s, [[Disney]] water parks had pool volleyball entertainment. DLRG- Ortsgruppe Havixbeck, has organized first water volley tournament in 1985, creating by-so water volleyball club. US has on its own developed powerful swimming pool play, creating volley standards. Water Volleyball is played throughout US Universities, such as: [[San Diego University]], [[California]], [[Iowa State University]], [[Iowa]], [[University of South Florida]], [[St. Petersburg, Florida|St. Petersburg]], [[Lenoir-Rhyne University]], N. C., [[Lindsey Wilson College]].
&lt;ref&gt; [https://dx.doi.org/10.31058/j.hr.2017.11001%20doi:10.31058/j.hr.2017.11001 ibid.] &lt;/ref&gt;
== Aqua-volei ==

The sport is known differently as aqua-volei (Brazil), voleibol acuático (Spain), Wasser-Volleyball (Germany), acqua pallavolo (Italy), vodní volejbal (Czech), splash/ pool/water volley (United States).
== Rules ==

===The court===
The court must be a rectangle a minimum 3 meters in length to a maximum of 6 meters in length. It can be a minimum of 2 meters in width to a maximum of 5 meters in width. The net must run across the width of the court and be centered along the length so that both players have an equal amount of court in which to play. In most pools there is a deep end and a shallow end. If possible try putting the net where both players are in the deep end.

===Serving===
The server must hit the ball upwards, towards the receiver and it must be within arms length of the receiver when standing still. The serve is not allowed to be a spike and the receiver can not spike of the serve. One team serves for 2 points then the other team serves, and play continues in this fashion. When it is 10 apiece, you start serving 1 serve each. A flip of a coin at the start of the game is used to see who serves first, or else the person in the deep end serves first.

===Game play===
Water volleyball is played between two teams, usually consisting of 1 to 4 players.

One team is chosen to serve first, whereupon they serve twice, then the team which did not serve first serves twice, and play continues in this fashion. The winner is first team to score eleven points. However, if the score gets to 10 apiece, then the team to score either two points ahead of the other team, or else first to fifteen points, wins the game. There are usually 5 games in a match.

===Scoring===
The first team to reach 11 points wins. If the score reaches 10 apiece, then it is first team to by 2 points or first to 15 points.

In the final round of group matches during the [[1979 Benson &amp; Hedges Cup]], a [[Limited overs cricket|one-day cricket]] competition, [[Somerset County Cricket Club]] faced [[Worcestershire County Cricket Club]] at [[New Road, Worcester]], on 24 May 1979. The result of the match would help to determine which teams progressed to the quarter-finals of the competition. If Somerset lost the match, and [[Glamorgan County Cricket Club|Glamorgan]] won their match, then Somerset, Worcestershire and Glamorgan would all be level on points, and bowling [[strike rate]] would be used as a tie-breaker. [[Brian Rose (cricketer)|Brian Rose]], Somerset's [[Captain (cricket)|captain]], realised that if he batted first and [[Declaration and forfeiture|declared]] the innings closed after just one [[Over (cricket)|over]], it would protect Somerset's strike rate advantage and guarantee them qualification. Somerset scored just one run from their over, and Worcestershire then took ten balls to score the two runs they needed to win. The match was completed in 18 minutes, and consisted of only 16 legal [[Delivery (cricket)|deliveries]].

Although Somerset's declaration was within the [[Laws of cricket|laws of the game]], Rose was condemned by the press and cricket officials. The ''[[Wisden Cricketers' Almanack]]'' claimed that Rose had "sacrificed all known cricketing principles by deliberately losing the game".&lt;ref name="wisden"/&gt; Just over a week after the match was played, the [[Test and County Cricket Board]] met for an emergency session and voted to expel Somerset from the competition by a vote of seventeen to one.

==Background==
Coming into the 1979 season, [[Somerset County Cricket Club|Somerset]] had never won a major trophy in their 104-year history.&lt;ref&gt;Foot 1986, p. 218.&lt;/ref&gt; The previous season, Somerset came close to winning each of the three English [[county cricket]] one-day competitions; they were losing semi-finalists in the [[1978 Benson &amp; Hedges Cup|Benson &amp; Hedges Cup]] and losing finalists in the [[1978 Gillette Cup|Gillette Cup]]. In the [[1978 John Player League|John Player League]], they finished second on [[run rate]]; Somerset, [[Hampshire County Cricket Club|Hampshire]] and [[Leicestershire County Cricket Club|Leicestershire]] were all tied on 48 points, but Hampshire had the superior run rate, and won the competition,&lt;ref name="1978 table"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Events/Tables/John_Player_League_1978.html |title=John Player League 1978 Table |website=CricketArchive |accessdate=17 April 2017 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; a similar fate to that they suffered in the [[1976 John Player League]], when five teams had tied on points, and Kent won on run rate.&lt;ref name="marks"&gt;Marks 1984, p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="1976 table"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Events/Tables/John_Player_League_1976.html |title=John Player League 1976 Table |website=CricketArchive |accessdate=17 April 2017 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Somerset team, which featured international players such as [[Viv Richards]] and [[Ian Botham]], was one of "the most talked-about and glamorous" cricket teams at the time, according to Somerset cricket historian David Foot.&lt;ref name="foot"&gt;Foot 1986, pp. 194–97.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Worcestershire County Cricket Club|Worcestershire]] were not challenging for honours as much as Somerset, though they had finished fourth in the 1978 John Player League,&lt;ref name="1978 table"/&gt; and had won the [[1974 County Championship]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://static.espncricinfo.com/db/NATIONAL/ENG/CHAMPIONSHIP/TABLES/CC_TABLE_1974.html |title=1974 County Cricket Championship |website=ESPNcricinfo |accessdate=17 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cricket was undergoing a period of increasing commercialism; [[Alex Bannister]] of the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' suggested that "the game [of cricket] is now about prize money and is more so-called professional"; the Benson &amp; Hedges Cup offered total prize money of over £27,000, with £6,500 of that being awarded to the winning team.&lt;ref name="cricketer6"/&gt;

Entering the final round of matches, Somerset led the group, having won all three of their matches. They faced Worcestershire, while [[Glamorgan County Cricket Club|Glamorgan]] had to play a side representing the [[Minor counties of English and Welsh cricket|Minor Counties]]. The Somerset players, led by their [[Captain (cricket)|captain]], [[Brian Rose (cricketer)|Brian Rose]], worked out that despite their place at the top of the table, they could still miss out on qualification for the quarter-finals. Aware of their previous problems with run rate in the 1976 and 1978 John Player League tournaments, they knew that if they lost heavily to Worcestershire, and Glamorgan beat the weak Minor Counties side by a large enough margin, all three teams would be level on points, and Worcestershire and Glamorgan could qualify by having superior [[Strike rate|bowling strike rates]].&lt;ref name="declare"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/magazine/content/story/405598.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160617194624/http://www.espncricinfo.com/magazine/content/story/405598.html |archive-date=17 June 2016 |title=I do declare |last=Williamson |first=Martin |website=ESPNcricinfo |date=23 May 2009 |accessdate=17 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rule Vii (c) of the Benson and Hedges Cup stated: "In the event of two or more teams in any zone having an equal number of points, their position shall be based on the faster rate of taking wickets in all zonal league matches (to be calculated by total balls bowled divided by wickets taken)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/15867310/arlotts_commentary_on_somerset_oneday/ |title=Art of winning without actually cheating |last=Arlott |first=John |authorlink=John Arlott |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=25 May 1979 |page=28 |via=[[Newspapers.com]]}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; After their near misses over the previous years, the Somerset players were determined that they were not going to miss out again; one of the players, [[Vic Marks]], later described how they wanted to "atone for the acute disappointments of the 1978 season."&lt;ref name="marks"/&gt;

In order to avoid suffering a heavy defeat that could eliminate them, Rose worked out that if they batted first and [[Declaration and forfeiture|declared]] within the first seven [[Delivery (cricket)|balls]] of their batting innings, it would not matter if they lost, as their bowling strike rate could not suffer sufficiently for them to be knocked out. There was no rule against declaring in one-day cricket, but Rose was aware that his plan was controversial.&lt;ref name="declare"/&gt; He discussed it with his teammates and there was no significant opposition–[[Derek Taylor (cricketer)|Derek Taylor]], the [[wicket-keeper]] did not like the idea, but was not vociferous in the discussion.&lt;ref name="foot"/&gt; Rose sought clarification from [[Donald Carr]], the chairman of the [[Test and County Cricket Board]] (TCCB), who administered cricket in England. Carr told Rose that his plan was legal, but against the spirit of the laws, and that he thought there would be repercussions if they went ahead with the plan.&lt;ref name="declare"/&gt; [[Roy Kerslake]], the Somerset chairman, was with the team in Worcester and though he had reservations, he told Rose that he would "support the team whatever their decision".&lt;ref name="foot"/&gt;

==Match==
===Summary===
The match was originally scheduled to be played on Wednesday 23 May at Worcestershire's [[New Road, Worcester|New Road]] ground in [[Worcester]], but no play was possible due to bad weather, and so the match was moved to the following day.&lt;ref name="declare"/&gt; The same thing happened in Watford, where Glamorgan and the Minor Counties were due to be playing.&lt;ref name="glam"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/481198.html |title=Benson &amp; Hedges Cup, Group A: Minor Counties South v Glamorgan at Watford, May 23–25, 1979 |website=ESPNcricinfo |accessdate=19 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although it was overcast and slightly wet the next morning, play started on time. Rose won the [[Toss (cricket)|toss]] for Somerset, and chose to bat first. The Somerset captain himself opened the batting, alongside [[Peter Denning (cricketer)|Peter Denning]]. Worcestershire's [[West Indies cricket team|West Indian]] bowler, [[Vanburn Holder]], bowled the first [[Over (cricket)|over]]. Holder bowled seven deliveries—six denoted a normal over, but he had to bowl one extra due to a [[no-ball]]—all to Rose, who did not play any scoring shots, and declared Somerset's innings complete at the end of the over. Somerset had scored just one run, which they were awarded for the no-ball, and Worcestershire only needed to score two to win. The players left the field for the ten-minute break between innings,&lt;ref name="declare"/&gt; and when they returned [[Glenn Turner]] and [[Alan Ormrod]] were the batsmen. [[Colin Dredge]] bowled the first over for Somerset, and Turner scored one run from it. [[Keith Jennings (cricketer)|Keith Jennings]] bowled the second over, and Turner scored another single from the fourth delivery to grant Worcestershire the victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cricketcountry.com/articles/somerset-declare-their-innings-after-one-over-in-a-one-day-match-140968 |title=Somerset declare their innings after one over in a One-Day match |website=Cricket Country |last=Sengupta |first=Arunabha |date=23 May 2016 |accessdate=24 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Play lasted for just 18 minutes (of which 10 minutes were the interval between innings) and 16 legal [[Delivery (cricket)|deliveries]]. There were around 100 spectators at the ground, but many were just arriving, or still travelling to the match. Charles Burnett was supposed to select the man of the match, but in light of the nature of the game, he decided that it would be "improper" to make such a selection.&lt;ref name="declare"/&gt;

The small crowd in Worcester were angered by the decision, and Worcestershire's secretary Mike Vockins gave all those present a full refund while describing Somerset's declaration as "an absolute disgrace". Some Somerset fans had travelled over {{convert|150|miles}} to watch the game, while [[Alan Gibson]] of ''[[The Times]]'' (although the paper was on strike at the time) had only just arrived at the railway station when he was told by a porter that he might as well head back as the match had finished.&lt;ref name="declare"/&gt; The Somerset team left the ground within 14 minutes of the end of the game. As they were leaving, one spectator banged on Rose's car window and shouted at him, "You've done a terrible thing for cricket."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |title=Somerset—for a different reason |last=Ross |first=Gordon |authorlink=Gordon Ross (writer) |magazine=The Cricketer |date=July 1979 |page=6 |url=http://magazine.cricketarchive.com/Magazine/1979/vol_60_no_7/index.html#21/z |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The wet weather which had delayed the match continued for most of the week, leaving the newspaper cricket journalists with little else to write about other than the "Worcester affair". Some speculated that the Somerset players may have placed bets on Worcestershire winning the match,&lt;ref name="marks"/&gt; while [[John Arlott]] of ''[[The Guardian]]'' was kinder, writing that Rose "did not infringe them &lt;nowiki&gt;[the rules of the competition]&lt;/nowiki&gt;, he exploited them". His newspaper blamed the action on the TCCB, suggesting that it was the rules that were to blame, rather than the players. In contrast, ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' complained that Rose was "plumbing the depths" with his "cynical tactics".&lt;ref name="declare"/&gt; In their end of year summary, the ''Wisden Cricketers' Almanack'' were disdainful of the declaration, writing that Rose had "sacrificed all known cricketing principles by deliberately losing the game".&lt;ref name="wisden"&gt;Preston 1980, p. 693.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this condemnation, Rose was still named as one of five [[Wisden Cricketers of the Year|''Wisden'' Cricketers of the Year]], primarily for captaining Somerset to their first major honours.&lt;ref name="wisden-coty"&gt;Preston 1980, pp. 77–80.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rose defended his actions, claiming that he "had no alternative", and that his "first duty is to Somerset. If anybody wishes to complain, he should do it to the people who make the rules."&lt;ref name="cricketer6"&gt;{{cite magazine |title=Somerset banned for freak declaration |magazine=The Cricketer |date=July 1979 |page=6 |url=http://magazine.cricketarchive.com/Magazine/1979/vol_60_no_7/index.html#8/z |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Somerset's president, [[Colin Atkinson]] spoke to representatives from Worcestershire the day after the game and offered to play the match again, but his suggestion was rejected.&lt;ref name="foot"/&gt; The TCCB chairman, Carr, made a statement after the game that "Somerset's action is totally contrary to the spirit of the competition, but is not in breach of the rules as they are written" and announced that an inquiry would be held at season's end.&lt;ref name="marks"/&gt; However, due to the strength and volume of complaints, a special meeting of the TCCB was called for 1 June. At that meeting, Somerset were disqualified from the competition by seventeen votes to one. Only the representative from Derbyshire opposed it, with even Somerset voting for the expulsion. Due to Somerset's disqualification, Glamorgan joined Worcestershire in the quarter-finals. As it turned out, had Somerset played the game as normal, they would have qualified, as Glamorgan's match against the Minor Counties ended with no result due to rain, leaving them two points behind Somerset and Worcestershire.&lt;ref name="declare"/&gt;

Although Atkinson initially gave a public apology, and stated that the declaration was "wholly indefensible",&lt;ref name="cricketer6"/&gt; he later suggested that he thought Somerset were victims of a [[kangaroo court]], and that the meeting had happened at a point when the topic was still very emotive and people were "baying for blood". Kerslake, the chairman, offered to resign, while Rose considered similar, but ultimately both continued in their roles.&lt;ref name="foot"/&gt; The Somerset players, who felt like they were being treated like criminals by the press, were concerned about what sort of reception they would get at their next match; a home fixture against [[Hampshire County Cricket Club|Hampshire]]. They need not have worried; the team were cheered onto the pitch, while Rose was given an individual standing ovation when he batted.&lt;ref name="marks"/&gt; A few supporters at the match hung out a banner stating "It's Brian Rose I do declare!".&lt;ref name="declare"/&gt;

Somerset went on to win the [[1979 Gillette Cup|Gillette Cup]] and [[1979 John Player League|John Player League]] that season,&lt;ref&gt;Preston 1980, p. 537.&lt;/ref&gt; while Worcestershire were eliminated from the Benson &amp; Hedges Cup in the quarter-finals by [[Surrey County Cricket Club|Surrey]].&lt;ref&gt;Preston 1980, p. 715.&lt;/ref&gt; The organising committee of the [[1979 Cricket World Cup]], which was held in England, met in early June and decided that declarations would not be allowed during the tournament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/22912715/ |title=Meeting on cricket rules |work=The Guardian |page=3 |date=9 June 1979 |via=[[Newspapers.com]]}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; The laws of cricket were subsequently altered to ban declarations in one-day cricket.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/cricket/article-1033265/The-day-Somerset-skipper-Brian-Rose-took-rules-limit-declared-ensure-went-through.html |title=The day Somerset skipper Brian Rose took the rules to the limit and declared in the first over to ensure his side went through |last=Lawford |first=Mark |work=[[Daily Mail]] |publisher=[[Daily Mail and General Trust|DMGT]] |location=London |date=8 July 2008 |accessdate=22 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arlott suggested that the strong action taken by the TCCB meant that it was unlikely that captains would seek to exploit any loopholes in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/22912793/ |title=Retrospective justice |last=Arlott |first=John |work=The Guardian |page=22 |date=2 June 1979 |via=[[Newspapers.com]]}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Frith]], writing for ''[[Wisden Cricket Monthly]]'' was similarly hopeful that the action taken would prevent any further instances of poor sportsmanship. Both of their suppositions were proved wrong, as just under two years later, [[Trevor Chappell]] bowled the last delivery of a [[One Day International]] match [[Underarm bowling incident of 1981|underarm]] to prevent [[New Zealand national cricket team|New Zealand]] from scoring the six runs they needed for victory.&lt;ref name="declare"/&gt; Similar to the declaration, the delivery was within the laws of the game, but was widely condemned for being against the spirit of cricket.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/magazine/content/story/498574.html |title=Underhand, underarm |last=Williamson |first=Martin |work=ESPNcricinfo |date=29 January 2011 |accessdate=18 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A not dissimilar incident occurred in Welsh club cricket in 2017, when Carew Cricket Club declared their final match of the season on 18 for one. They had worked out that a loss would still result in them winning the league, as long as their opponents, who were second in the league, did not score any batting or bowling bonus points. Carew retained their victory over Pembroke County Cricket Club, and also their league title, however a league disciplinary committee decided to relegate the team, impose a £300 fine, and suspend their captain for the start of the following season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/09/27/village-cricket-team-relegated-spineless-declaration-led-title/ |title=Village cricket team relegated for 'spineless' declaration that led to title |last=Watson |first=Leon |work=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]] |date=27 September 2017 |accessdate=18 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
