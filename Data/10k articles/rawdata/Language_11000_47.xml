'''Abu Bakr Abd al-Qāhir bin Abd ar-Rahman bin Muhammad al-Jurjānī''' (400 – 471 or 474 A.H.) (died 1078 AD)&lt;ref name=Britannica&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |year=1978 |title =Jurjānī, al- |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica |edition= 15th}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a renowned [[Persians|Persian]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ʿABD-AL-QĀHER JORJĀNĪ – Encyclopaedia Iranica|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/abd-al-qaher-jorjani-grammarian-rhetorician-and-literary-theorist-d-1078|website=www.iranicaonline.org|publisher=Encyclopedia Iranica|accessdate=11 February 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; scholar of the [[Arabic language]], literary theorist, grammarian and [[Shafi'i|Shafi'i Muslim]]. al-Jurjānī was an [[Ahsa'ari]] descendant, and born in the town of [[Gorgan]] in [[Iran]].

Al-Jurjānī is said not to have left his home town of Gorgan all his life, yet his reputation reached many Arabic scholars who came to see him. He excelled in the two sciences of ''ilm al balaghah'' (eloquence and rhetorical art) and ''ilm al bayan'' (a branch of Arabic rhetoric dealing with [[metaphor]]ical language), which he explained in his two books ''Asrār al-Balāghah'' (''Secrets of Rhetoric''), and ''Dalāʾīl al-ʿIjāz fi-l-Qurʾān'' (''Arguments of the Miraculous Inimitability of the Quran''). Al-Jurjānī was influenced by his predecessors such as the grammarian [[Sibawayh]], the critic [[Abi Helal al-'Askari al Balaghi]], and the linguist and literary theorist [[Abu Ali al-Farisi]], known for his book ''al-Idah'' (''Elucidation'').

Ali al-Farisi's nephew, Abi al-Hussein Muhammad Bin al-Hassan Bin Abd al-Wareth al-Faressi al-Nawawi, was al-Jurjānī's teacher, and taught al-Jurjānī the ''al-Idah''. Later al-Jurjānī was to write a thirty-volume work of commentary on ''al-Idah'' entitled ''al Maghna fi Sharh al-Idah'' &lt;!-- translation? --&gt;.

== In modern critical opinion ==
In his volume ''Asrar al-Balaghah'', Muhammad Abdul Mun'em Khafagi writes "the Swiss linguist [[Ferdinand de Saussure|Saussure]]'s theory of [[deconstruction]] is preceded by Abd al-Qāhir al-Jurjānī’s theory of deconstruction".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Also, in the introduction of Muhammad Abdul Muttaleb's book ''Issues of Modernism in the Works of Abd-al-Qāhir al-Jurjānī'', Muttaleb writes of al-Jurjānī and [[Noam Chomsky]] "there is a similarity between these two men".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

'''Afenmai''' (Afemai), or '''Yekhee''', is an [[Edoid language]] spoken in [[Edo State]], [[Nigeria]] by [[Afenmai people]]. Not all speakers recognize the name "Yekhee"; some use the district name ''Etsako''.

Prevuously the name used by British colonial administration was '''Kukuruku''', supposedly after a battle cry "ku-ku-ruku",&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=AGuri9TP5kgC&amp;pg=PA109&amp;lpg=PA109]&lt;/ref&gt; now considered derogatory.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ethnologue.com/language/ets]&lt;/ref&gt;

Afenmai is unusual in reportedly having a [[voiceless alveolar tapped fricative|voiceless tapped fricative]] as the "tense" equivalent of the "lax" voiced tap {{IPA|/ɾ/}} (compare {{IPA|[aɾ̞̊u]}} 'hat' and {{IPA|[aɾu]}} 'louse'&lt;ref&gt;Laver (1994) ''Principles of Phonetics'', p. 263.&lt;/ref&gt;), though is other descriptions it is described simply as a fricative and analyzed as the "lax" equivalent of the "tense" voiceless stop {{IPA|/t/}}.&lt;ref name=WPP/&gt;

==Phonology==
Vowels are {{IPA|/i e ɛ a ɔ o u/}}. Long vowels and the large number of diphthong in the language are derived from sequences of short vowels, often from the optional elision of {{IPA|/l/}}.

Afenmai has a complex system of morphotonemic alterations based on two phonemic tones, high and low. At the surface level there are five distinctive tones: high, low, falling, rising and mid. Mid tone is the result of [[downstep]] of a high tone after a low tone. The contour tones (falling and rising) either occur on long vowels or diphthongs, from a sequence of high+low or low+high, or on short vowels produced from the contraction of such a long vowel or diphthong. Rising tones are rather uncommon, as they tend to be replaced by high, low or mid.&lt;ref name=WPP/&gt;

Consonants of the Ekpheli dialect are:
{| class="wikitable IPA"
|-
!BL||LD||D||Av||PA||Ve||LV
|-
| mː m || || || n || (ɲ) || || 
|-
| b p || || || t(ː) d || || kː ɡː || k͡pː k͡p ɡ͡bː ɡ͡b
|-
| || || || ts dz || (tʃ dʒ) || ||
|-
| || f v(ː) || θ || s || (ʃ) || x ɣ
|-
| ʋ || || || l || j || || w
|-
| || || || ɾ || || 
|}

The consonants marked long have been analyzed in various ways, including 'tense' or 'fortis' and paired up with 'lax' or 'lenis' partners, though there is no phonological basis for grouping the supposed 'long' consonants together, or for partnering them with particular 'short' consonants. The clear cases are {{IPA|/k͡pː ɡ͡bː mː/}}, which are twice as long as {{IPA|/k͡p ɡ͡b m/}} but otherwise identical in a spectrogram. {{IPA|/kː ɡː/}} are likewise twice as long as {{IPA|/x ɣ/}}. However, alveolar {{IPA|/t/}} is only slightly longer than dental {{IPA|/θ/}}, and while {{IPA|/v/}} is longer than {{IPA|/ʋ/}}, that's to be expected for a fricative compared to an approximant.&lt;ref name=WPP&gt;Elimelech (1976) "A Tonal Grammar of Etsako", ''UCLA Working Papers in Phonetics'' 35 [https://escholarship.org/uc/item/7qd5v492]&lt;/ref&gt;

The postalveolar consonants are allophones of the alveolars before {{IPA|/i/}} plus another vowel, where {{IPA|/i/}} would otherwise become {{IPA|[j]}}, as in {{IPA|/siesie/ [ʃeʃe]}} 'to be small'. It addition, {{IPA|/ts/}} optionally becomes {{IPA|[tʃ]}} before a single {{IPA|/i/}}, as in {{IPA|/itsi/}} 'pig' ({{IPA|[itsi] ~ [itʃi]}}). The other alveolar consonants do not have this variation, unless the triggering environment is provided within a prosodic word: {{IPA|/odzi/}} 'crab' ({{IPA|[odzi]}} in citation form) &gt; {{IPA|/odzi oɣie/}} 'the king's crab' ({{IPA|[odʒoɣje]}}). (The sounds transcribed with {{angle bracket|{{IPA|ʃ ʒ ɲ}}}} may actually be closer to {{IPA|[ɕ ʑ nʲ]}}.)

Apart from {{IPA|/p ts dz θ/}}, these consonants appear in all dialects of Afenmai investigated by Elimelech (1976). {{IPA|/p/}} is absent from Uzairue dialect, being replaced by {{IPA|/f/}}, and is quite rare in most other dialects. {{IPA|/ts dz/}} are fricativized to {{IPA|/s z/}} in Aviele and South Uneme dialects. {{IPA|/θ/}} is retracted to {{IPA|/ɹ̝̊/}} in most other dialects, as in {{IPA|[aθu ~ aɹ̝̊u]}} 'hat'.&lt;ref name=WPP/&gt;

'''Amto–Musan''' is a [[language family]] of two closely related but not mutually intelligible [[Papuan languages]], [[Amto language|Amto]] and [[Siawi language|Siawi]], of the [[Sandaun Province]] of [[Papua New Guinea]]. Amto–Musan was left unclassified by Ross (2005) (see [[Papuan languages#Ross classification]]) due to lack of data; Wurm (1975) had posited it as an independent family. The family has [[language typology|typological]] similarities with the [[Busa language (Papuan)|Busa]] [[language isolate]], but these do not appear to demonstrate a genetic relationship.

Timothy Usher links the Amto–Musan languages to their neighbors, the [[Arai languages]] and the [[Pyu language (Papua New Guinea)|Pyu language]] in as Arai–Samaia stock.&lt;ref&gt;[https://sites.google.com/site/newguineaworld/families/arai-and-samaia-rivers NewGuineaWorld, Arai and Samaia Rivers]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1715">'''Animal symbolicum''' ("symbol-making" or "symbolizing animal") is a [[List of alternative names for the human species|definition for humans]] proposed by the German [[neo-Kantian]] [[Ernst Cassirer]]. 

The tradition since [[Aristotle]] has defined a human being as ''animal rationale'' (a [[rational animal]]). However, Cassirer claimed that man's outstanding characteristic is not in his [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] or physical nature, but rather in his work. [[Human]]ity cannot be known directly, but has to be known through the analysis of the symbolic universe that man has created historically. Thus man should be defined as ''animal symbolicum'' (a symbol-making or symbolizing animal). 
On this basis, Cassirer sought to understand [[human nature]] by exploring symbolic forms in all aspects of a human being's experience. His work is represented in his three-volume ''Philosophie der Symbolischen Formen'' (1923–9, translated as ''The Philosophy of Symbolic Forms'') and is summarized in his ''An Essay on Man''. [[W. J. T. Mitchell]] used this term in his essay on "representation" to say that

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"man, for many philosophers both ancient and modern, is the "representational animal,"  ''homo symbolicum'' {{sic}}, the creature whose distinctive character is the creation and manipulation of signs - things that stand for or take the place of something else." &lt;ref&gt;McLaughlin, T. &amp; Lentricchia, F. (1990). Critical Terms for [[Literary criticism|Literary Study]]. Chicago: [[University of Chicago|The University of Chicago]] press&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Botanical nomenclature''' is the formal, scientific naming of plants. It is related to, but distinct from [[Alpha taxonomy|taxonomy]]. Plant taxonomy is concerned with grouping and classifying plants; botanical nomenclature then provides names for the results of this process. The starting point for modern botanical nomenclature is  [[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus]]' ''[[Species Plantarum]]'' of 1753. Botanical nomenclature is governed by the ''[[International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants]]'' (''ICN''), which replaces the ''International Code of Botanical Nomenclature'' (''ICBN''). [[Fossil plant]]s are also covered by the code of nomenclature.

Within the limits set by that code there is another set of rules, the ''[[International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants|International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants (ICNCP)]]'' which applies to plant [[cultivar]]s that have been deliberately altered or selected by humans (see [[cultigen]]).

==History and scope==

Botanical nomenclature has a long history, going back beyond the period when Latin was the scientific language throughout Europe, to [[Theophrastus]] (c. 370–287 BC), [[Dioscorides]] (c. 40 – 90 AD) and other [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] writers. Many of these works have come down to us in [[Latin]] translations. The principal Latin writer on botany was [[Pliny the Elder]] (23–79 AD). From Mediaeval times, Latin became the universal scientific language ([[lingua franca]]) in Europe. Most written plant knowledge was the property of monks, particularly [[Benedictine]], and the purpose of those early [[herbals]] was primarily medicinal rather than plant science ''per se''. It would require the invention of the [[printing press]] (1450) to make such information more widely available.{{sfn|Stearn|1992}}{{sfn|Stearn|2002}}{{sfn|Pavord|2005}}

[[Leonhart Fuchs]], a German physician and botanist is often considered the originator of Latin names for the rapidly increasing number of plants known to science. For instance he coined the name ''[[Digitalis]]'' in his ''[[De Historia Stirpium Commentarii Insignes]]'' (1542).

A key event was [[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus’]] adoption of [[Binomial nomenclature|binomial names]] for plant species in his ''Species Plantarum'' (1753).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Barkworth |first=M. |year=2004 |title=Botanical Nomenclature (Nomenclature, Names, and Taxonomy) |publisher=University of Utah |url=http://herbarium.usu.edu/teaching/4420/botnom.htm |accessdate=2011-02-20 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5wdX3kH4m?url=http://herbarium.usu.edu/teaching/4420/botnom.htm |archivedate=2011-02-20 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the nineteenth century it became increasingly clear that there was a need for rules to govern scientific nomenclature, and initiatives were taken to refine the  body of laws initiated by Linnaeus. These were published in successively more sophisticated editions. For plants, key dates are 1867 (''lois'' de Candolle) and 1906 (''International Rules of Botanical Nomenclature'', 'Vienna Rules'). The most recent is the ''Melbourne Code'', adopted in 2011.&lt;ref name=MelbourneCode&gt;{{cite book |author1=McNeill, J. |author2=Barrie, F.R. |author3=Buck, W.R. |author4=Demoulin, V. |author5=Greuter, W. |author6=Hawksworth, D.L. |author7=Herendeen, P.S. |author8=Knapp, S. |author9=Marhold, K. |author10=Prado, J. |author11=Prud'homme Van Reine, W.F. |author12=Smith, G.F. |author13=Wiersema, J.H. |author14=Turland, N.J. |year=2012 |volume=Regnum Vegetabile 154 |title=International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (Melbourne Code) adopted by the Eighteenth International Botanical Congress Melbourne, Australia, July 2011 |publisher=A.R.G. Gantner Verlag KG  |isbn=978-3-87429-425-6 |url=http://www.iapt-taxon.org/nomen/main.php?page=title }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another development was the insight into the delimitation of the concept of 'plant'. Gradually more and more groups of organisms are being recognised as being independent of plants. Nevertheless, the formal names of most of these organisms are governed by the (ICN), even today. Some [[protist]]s that do not fit easily into either plant or animal categories are treated under either or both of the ICN and the [[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature|ICZN]]. A separate ''Code'' was adopted to govern the nomenclature of Bacteria, the ''[[International Code of Nomenclature of Bacteria]]''.

==Relationship to taxonomy==
Botanical nomenclature is closely linked to plant taxonomy, and botanical nomenclature serves plant taxonomy, but nevertheless botanical nomenclature is separate from plant taxonomy. Botanical nomenclature is merely the body of rules prescribing which name applies to that taxon (see [[correct name (botany)|correct name]]) and if a new name may (or must) be coined.

Plant [[alpha taxonomy|taxonomy]] is an empirical science, a science that determines what constitutes a particular [[taxon]] (taxonomic grouping, plural: taxa): e.g. "What plants belong to this species?" and "What species belong to this genus?". The definition of the limits of a taxon is called its '[[Circumscription (taxonomy)|circumscription]]'. For a particular taxon, if two taxonomists agree exactly on its circumscription, [[rank (taxonomy)|rank]] and position (i.e. the higher rank in which it is included) then there is only one name which can apply under the ''ICN''.&lt;ref&gt;McNeill et al. 2012, Principle IV&lt;/ref&gt; Where they differ in opinion on any of these issues, one and the same plant may be placed in taxa with different names. As an example, consider Siehe's Glory-of-the-Snow, ''[[Chionodoxa siehei]]'':
[[Image:Chionodoxa siehei closeup.jpg|thumb|Flowers of ''Chionodoxa siehei'', which can also be called ''Scilla siehei'', or included in ''Chionodoxa forbesii'' or in ''Scilla forbesii'']]
* Taxonomists can disagree as to whether two groups of plants are sufficiently distinct to be put into one species or not. Thus ''[[Chionodoxa siehei]]'' and ''[[Chionodoxa forbesii]]'' have been treated as a single species by some taxonomists or as two species by others.&lt;ref name="DashwoodMathew2005"&gt;{{Citation |last=Dashwood |first=Melanie |last2=Mathew |first2=Brian |year=2005 |title=Hyacinthaceae – little blue bulbs (RHS Plant Trials and Awards, Bulletin Number 11) |publisher=Royal Horticultural Society |url=http://www.rhs.org.uk/getattachment/04d1dd16-01be-4c31-9510-8a081dfa23b0/Hyacinthaceae---Little-Blue-Bulbs-Bulletin.aspx |accessdate=19 February 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5wdYF0E05?url=http://www.rhs.org.uk/getattachment/04d1dd16-01be-4c31-9510-8a081dfa23b0/Hyacinthaceae---Little-Blue-Bulbs-Bulletin.aspx |archivedate=20 February 2011 |lastauthoramp=yes |deadurl=yes |df= }}, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; If treated as one species, the earlier published name must be used,&lt;ref name="MelbIII"&gt;McNeill et al. 2012, Principle III&lt;/ref&gt; so plants previously called ''Chionodoxa siehei'' become ''Chionodoxa forbesii''.
* Taxonomists can disagree as to whether two genera are sufficiently distinct to be kept separate or not. While agreeing that the genus ''[[Chionodoxa]]'' is closely related to the genus ''[[Scilla]]'', nevertheless the bulb specialist [[Brian Mathew]] considers that their differences warrant maintaining separate genera.&lt;ref name="DashwoodMathew2005"/&gt; Others disagree, and would refer to ''Chionodoxa siehei'' as ''Scilla siehei''. The earliest published genus name must be used when genera are merged;&lt;ref name="MelbIII"/&gt; in this case ''Scilla'' was published earlier and is used (not ''Chionodoxa'').
* Taxonomists can disagree as to the limits of families. When the [[Angiosperm Phylogeny Group]] (APG) first published its classification of the flowering plants in 1998, ''Chionodoxa siehei'' would have been placed in the family Hyacinthaceae.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Angiosperm Phylogeny Group |year=1998 |title=An ordinal classification for the families of flowering plants |journal=Annals of the Missouri Botanical Garden |volume=85 |issue=4 |pages=531–553 |url=http://www.bergianska.se/pub/publikationer/Bremer/Angiosperm_et_al_1998.pdf |accessdate=2011-02-19 |doi=10.2307/2992015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2009 revision of their classification, the APG no longer recognize the Hyacinthaceae as a separate family, merging it into a greatly enlarged family [[Asparagaceae]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Angiosperm Phylogeny Group III |year=2009 |title=An update of the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group classification for the orders and families of flowering plants: APG III |journal=Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society |volume=161 |issue=2 |pages=105–121 |doi=10.1111/j.1095-8339.2009.00996.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus ''Chionodoxa siehei'' moves from the Hyacinthaceae to the Asparagaceae.
* Taxonomists can disagree as to the rank of a taxon. Rather than allow the Hyacinthaceae to disappear altogether, Chase et al. suggested that it be treated as a subfamily within the Asparagaceae.&lt;ref name="Chase2009"&gt;{{Citation |last=Chase |first=M.W. |last2=Reveal |first2=J.L. |last3=Fay |first3=M.F. |year=2009 |title=A subfamilial classification for the expanded asparagalean families Amaryllidaceae, Asparagaceae and Xanthorrhoeaceae|journal=Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society |volume=161 |issue=2 |pages=132–136|doi=10.1111/j.1095-8339.2009.00999.x |lastauthoramp=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''ICN'' requires family names to end with "-aceae" and subfamily names to end with "-oideae".&lt;ref&gt;McNeill et al. 2012, Article 19.1&lt;/ref&gt; Thus a possible name for the Hyacinthaceae when treated as a subfamily would be 'Hyacinthoideae'. However, the name [[Scilloideae]] had already been published in 1835 as the name for a subfamily containing the genus ''Scilla'', so this name has priority and must be used.&lt;ref name="Chase2009"/&gt; Hence for those taxonomists who accept  the APG system of 2009, ''Chionodoxa siehei'' can be placed in the subfamily Scilloideae of the family Asparagaceae. However, a taxonomist is perfectly free to continue to argue that Hyacinthaceae should be maintained as a separate family from the other families which were merged into the Asparagaceae.

In summary, if a plant has different names or is placed in differently named taxa:  
* If the confusion is purely nomenclatural, i.e. it concerns what to call a taxon which has the same circumscription, rank and position, the ''ICN'' provides rules to settle the differences, typically by prescribing that the earliest published name must be used, although names can be [[conservation (botany)|conserved]]. 
* If the confusion is taxonomic, i.e. taxonomists differ in opinion on the circumscription, rank or position of taxa, then only more scientific research can settle the differences, and [[Lumpers and splitters|even then only sometimes]].

[[File:Amsterdam - Funfair - 0560.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Children playing a competitive racing game in Amsterdam.]]
A '''carnival game''' is a [[game of chance]] or [[game of skill|skill]] that can be seen at a [[traveling carnival]], charity fund raiser, [[amusement arcade]] and [[amusement park]], or on a [[State fair|state]] and [[county fairs|county]] fair [[midway (fair)|midway]]. They are also commonly played on [[holiday]]s such as [[Mardi Gras]], [[Saint Patrick's Day]], and [[Oktoberfest]].

Carnival games are usually operated on a "pay per play" basis. Prices may range from a small amount, for example 25 [[Cent (currency)|cent]]s, to a few dollars per play. Most games offer a small prize to the winner. Prizes may include items like stuffed animals, toys, or posters. Continued play is encouraged as multiple small prizes may be traded in for a larger prize. [[Multiplayer video game|Multiplayer games]]—the "[[Watergun]]" game is one example—may change the size of the prize with the number of players. In a more difficult game, including the "Baseball and Basket" or "Stand the Bottle", a large prize may be awarded to any winner.

Carnival games have a poor reputation in some areas. This may be that some carnival games utilize [[optical illusion]]s or physical relationships that make it hard for a player to judge the game's difficulty. Also, some operators have run games that are rigged to take advantage of unsuspecting players. In many areas, these games are tested by local law enforcement to find unfairly run games.

==Carnival game operators==
At amusement parks, the carnival games are usually owned and operated by the park owner. The games are usually installed in permanent buildings stationed around the park. A [[traveling carnival]] may, however, be made up of multiple independent game concession owners. These independents owners contract their games with the carnival operator.&lt;ref&gt;[http://showpeople.typepad.com/carnivals/2006/09/planningride_co.html Carneytown - Planning-Ride Company and Vendors] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090122215020/http://showpeople.typepad.com/carnivals/2006/09/planningride_co.html |date=2009-01-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Carnival games of this type are mounted to towable trailers that enable the game to be moved from site to site. However, there a still some free-standing game booths that are assembled on site. These carnival games are usually set up in rows along the [[Midway (fair)|midway]] area along with the rides.

==Types of carnival games==

===Games of chance===
[[Image:Duck Pond Booth.jpg|thumb|right|170px|'''The Duck Pond Game''']]
[[Game of chance|Games of chance]] are favorite carnival games. A random outcome gives all players the chance of winning a prize. An example of a carnival game of chance is the "Dime Pitch" game. The objective is to toss a coin (typically a [[Dime (United States coin)|dime]] or [[Quarter (United States coin)|quarter]]) onto a horizontal board that has random marks on it. The marks on the board are the same diameter as the coin thrown. By completely covering the mark on the board with the coin, the player wins. Another example of a game of chance is the "Birthday" game. Players place their bets on a rail mounted strip that has months, colors and holidays written on it. Many players choose the month of their birth for their bet. A random player is then selected to throw a large multisided [[dice|die]] into a designated center area (play area) of the booth. The die thrown has corresponding months, colors and [[holiday]]s written on the different sides. The month, color or holiday that shows on the top of the thrown die, when it stops, will indicate the winner.

In the "Pingpong Ball and Fish Bowl", players throw pingpong balls at a table filled with rows of empty small [[fish bowl]]s. If the player gets a ball in the bowl, they usually win a [[goldfish]]. A game like the "Duck Pond", which is geared for young children, may offer a winner every time. The player selects a [[rubber duck]] that is floating at random in water. Writing on the bottom of the duck reveals the prize won.

===Games of skill===
[[File:Puesto de la feria del mole 2014 23.JPG|thumb|Shooting game at a [[Mole sauce|mole]] festival in [[San Pedro Atocpan]], Mexico City]]
[[Game of skill|Games of skill]] are another favorite carnival game. These games may test a players aim at hitting a target with either a ball or a [[weapon]]. Some games of this type are the "Cross Bow Shoot", the "Milk Bottle" game, or the "Balloon and Dart" game.

Other skill testing games challenge the physical abilities of the player. One example of this type of game is the "[[rope ladder|Rope Ladder]] Climb". In this game, the player must keep their balance while climbing an angled rope ladder that can pivot and invert the player. The object of the game is to climb the ladder, without falling off, and ring a bell at the end of the climb. Another game that tests the physical abilities of the player is [[High striker|"Ring the Bell"]]. The player uses a large [[mallet]] to strike a pivot board on the game, this causes an indicator to be driven vertically up an indicator scale board. By hitting the pivot hard enough, the indicator will ring a bell mounted at the top of the indicator scale board indicating a win. '''Cover the spot''' is a game that involves covering a giant red spot with five smaller discs dropped by hand; all red (or color) must be covered to win.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.deceptology.com/2011/01/cover-spot-carnival-game.html |title=The Cover the Spot carnival game |accessdate=2016-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=="Rigged" carnival games==
[[Image:Ball And Bucket Game.jpg|thumb|right|170px|'''The Ball and Basket or Bucket Game''']]
Carnival games are often viewed or portrayed as dishonest, due to past history that may not necessarily apply to modern-day games and operators.  The term "[[Mark (victim)|mark]]" (meaning sucker) originated with the carnival.&lt;ref name="pac-c.org"&gt;[http://www.pac-c.org/Carnies.htm "Chicanery On The Midway"] PAC-C.org (Professionals Against Confidence Crime) Deputy Marshal Dave Goldenberg's article: 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

When dishonest carnival game operators found someone who they could entice to keep playing their rigged (slang term: "gaffed") game,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vivaconsulting.com/advocacy/34.pdf "Unbalanced Reel Gaming Machines"] Tim Falkiner &amp; Roger Horbay's Abstract: September 9, 2006 page 4 "The Gaffed Milk Bottle Game"&lt;/ref&gt; they would then "[[Mark (victim)|mark]]" the individual by patting their back with a hand that had chalk on it. Other game operators would then look for these chalk marks and entice the individuals to also play their rigged game.&lt;ref name="pac-c.org"/&gt;

Rigging a carnival game may be done in many different manners depending on the game. For example, the "Ball and Basket" game may be rigged by moving the "A" frame onto which the basket is mounted. This would change the trajectory of the ball. Another method has the operator leaving a ball in the basket for the demonstration which absorbs the energy of the tossed ball, enabling the ball to stay in the basket, and then remove it when the mark plays, which makes the ball much more susceptible to bouncing out. In a game like "Ring Toss", the blocks that the prizes are attached to are cut in such a way as to ensure the ring will not fit. The "Balloon and Dart" game can be rigged by underinflating the balloons or by using dull point darts. Some games may be rigged to play honestly or dishonestly and can be switched by the game operator. The "[[milk bottle|Milk Bottle]]" game can be rigged this way. On a rigged game, one of the milk bottles is heavier than the others. Depending on how the bottles are stacked will determine if the player will win.&lt;ref name="pac-c.org"/&gt;

Some games are simply impossible to win. One such game is the "Push 'em Up" (or "Stand the Bottle"){{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} game, which requires the player to stand up a bottle with a 2-tine plastic fork, was featured in [[List of Penn &amp; Teller Tell a Lie episodes#Episode 5|episode 5]] of [[Penn &amp; Teller Tell a Lie]]. The bottles used in the game are weighted on one side, which makes it impossible to stand the bottles upright without tipping them over when the heavier side is rotated to the top. The "Bottle Up," often confused with this game, is simply a skill game where the player uses a fishing pole with a ring attached to the end of the string to stand up the bottle.

By rigging the game, the game operators can vastly increase the money they take in.

In many areas, local law enforcement will test the carnival games prior to and during the carnival to help eliminate rigged games.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bigduck.tripod.com/policemagic/id21.html "Police officer-magician shows kids tricks of carnival games"] Teresa Stepzinski, ''The Times-Union Brunswick News'' March 28, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;  However, there are still some dishonest game operators. One method they use to avoid law enforcement is to give legitimate instruments or make the carnival game "fair-and-square" during testing, but rig it for other people.&lt;ref name="pac-c.org"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://vt.essortment.com/beatcarnivalga_rayx.htm "How to beat carnival games"] essortment article by Pagewise 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Coprolalia''' is involuntary swearing or the involuntary utterance of obscene words or socially inappropriate and derogatory remarks. Coprolalia comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] κόπρος (''kopros'') meaning "[[feces]]" and λαλιά (''lalia'') from ''lalein'', "to talk".&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/coprolalia Coprolalia.] Dictionary.com, Accessed 30 October 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Coprolalia is an occasional characteristic of [[tic disorder]]s, in particular [[Tourette syndrome]], although it is not required for a diagnosis of Tourette's and only about 10% of Tourette's patients exhibit coprolalia.&lt;ref name=SingerBehavior&gt;{{cite journal |author=Singer HS |title=Tourette's syndrome: from behaviour to biology |journal=Lancet Neurol |volume=4 |issue=3 |pages=149–59 |date=March 2005 |pmid=15721825 |doi=10.1016/S1474-4422(05)01012-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not unique to tic disorders; it is also a rare symptom of other [[neurology|neurological]] disorders.

Related involuntary actions are [[copropraxia]], performing obscene or forbidden gestures,&lt;ref name=dude&gt;{{cite journal |author=Schapiro NA |title='Dude, you don't have Tourette's:' Tourette's syndrome, beyond the tics |journal=Pediatr Nurs |volume=28 |issue=3 |pages=243–6, 249–53 |year=2002 |pmid=12087644 |url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/442029 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[coprographia]], making obscene writings or drawings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.uwm.edu/Course/ling210/lectures/semantics-2.pdf | title=Linguistics 210 Semantics | work=Semantic features and Tourette’s Syndrome | accessdate=21 November 2006 | format=pdf }}  While this source defines coprographia, it makes misrepresentations about copro phenomena in relation to Tourette's:  they are not common, and not required for diagnosis.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
Coprolalia encompasses words and phrases that are culturally [[taboo]] or generally unsuitable for acceptable social use, when used out of context. The term is not used to describe contextual swearing. It is usually expressed out of social or emotional context, and may be spoken in a louder tone or different cadence or pitch than normal conversation. It can be a single word, or complex phrases. A person with coprolalia may repeat the word mentally rather than saying it out loud; these subvocalizations can be very distressing.&lt;ref name=TSAbrochure&gt;Cohen, J.E. and Levi-Pearl, S. Understanding Coprolalia - A misunderstood symptom. Available from the [http://store.tsa-usa.org/for-families--general-interest--professionals.html Tourette Syndrome Association], Accessed 30 October 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Coprolalia is an occasional characteristic of [[Tourette syndrome]], although it is not required for a diagnosis of Tourette's. In Tourette syndrome, compulsive swearing can be uncontrollable and undesired by the person uttering the phrases. Involuntary outbursts, such as racial or ethnic slurs in the company of those most offended by such remarks, can be particularly embarrassing. The phrases uttered by a person with coprolalia do not necessarily reflect the thoughts or opinions of the person.&lt;ref name=TSAbrochure/&gt;

Cases of deaf Tourette patients swearing in [[sign language]] have been described,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Morris HR, Thacker AJ, Newman PK, Lees AJ |title=Sign language tics in a prelingually deaf man |journal=Mov.

==Prevalence==
Only about 10% of Tourette's patients exhibit coprolalia,&lt;ref name=SingerBehavior/&gt; but it tends to attract more attention than any other symptom.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20050208082423/http://www.tsa-usa.org/what_is/Faqs.html Tourette Syndrome FAQ.] Tourette Syndrome Association. Accessed 6 October 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;   There is a paucity of [[epidemiological study|epidemiological studies]] of Tourette syndrome; [[ascertainment bias]] affects [[clinical trial|clinical studies]]. Studies on people with Tourette's often "came from tertiary referral samples, the sickest of the sick".&lt;ref name=Swerdlow&gt;{{cite journal |author=Swerdlow NR |title=Tourette syndrome: current controversies and the battlefield landscape |journal=Curr Neurol Neurosci Rep |volume=5 |issue=5 |pages=329–31 |date=September 2005 |pmid=16131414 |doi=10.1007/s11910-005-0054-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Further, the criteria for a diagnosis of Tourette's were changed in 2000, when the impairment criterion was removed from the [[DSM-IV-TR]] for all tic disorders,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.psychnet-uk.com/x_new_site/DSM_IV/misc_pages/what_is_dsm_iv_tr.html |title=What is DSM-IV-TR? |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |website=Psychnet-UK |access-date=21 June 2016 |quote="Tourette’s Disorder and all of the Tic Disorders no longer require that symptoms cause distress or impair functioning."}}&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in increased diagnoses of milder cases. Further, many clinical studies suffer from small sample size. These factors combine to render older estimates of coprolalia&amp;mdash;biased towards clinical populations of the more severe cases&amp;mdash;outdated. An international, multi-site database of 3,500 individuals with Tourette syndrome drawn from clinical samples found 14% of patients with Tourette's accompanied by [[comorbidity|comorbid conditions]] had coprolalia, while only 6% of those with uncomplicated ("pure") Tourette's had coprolalia. The same study found that the chance of having coprolalia increased linearly with the number of comorbid conditions:  patients with four or five other conditions&amp;mdash;in addition to tics&amp;mdash;were four to six times more likely to have coprolalia than persons with only Tourette's.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Freeman RD, Fast DK, Burd L, Kerbeshian J, Robertson MM, Sandor P |title=An international perspective on Tourette syndrome: selected findings from 3,500 individuals in 22 countries |journal=Dev Med Child Neurol |volume=42 |issue=7 |pages=436–47 |date=July 2000 |pmid=10972415 |doi=10.1017/S0012162200000839}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One study of a general pediatric practice found an 8% rate of coprolalia in children with Tourette syndrome, while another study found 60% in a tertiary referral center (where typically more severe cases are referred).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Singer C |title=Tourette syndrome.

==Treatment==
Some patients have been treated by injecting [[botulinum toxin]] (botox) near the [[vocal cords]].

{{Refimprove|date=May 2013}}
A '''cover band''' (or '''covers band'''), is a [[band (music)|band]] that plays songs recorded by someone else, sometimes mimicking the original as perfectly as possible, and sometimes re-interpreting or changing the original. These remade songs are known as  [[cover version|cover songs]]. New or unknown bands often find the format marketable for smaller venues, such as pubs, clubs, or parks. The bands also perform at private events, for example, weddings and birthday parties and may be known as a '''wedding band''', '''party band''', '''function band''' or '''band-for-hire'''. A band whose covers consist mainly of songs that were chart hits is often called a '''top 40 band'''. Some bands, however, start as cover bands, then grow to perform original material. For example, [[The Rolling Stones]] released three albums consisting primarily of covers before recording one with their own original material.

Cover bands play several types of venues.  When a band is starting out, they might play private parties and fundraisers, often for little or no money, or in return for food and bar privileges, although many professional musicians refuse to do this.  With enough experience, a band will begin to "play out" professionally at bars and night clubs. Some cover bands are made up of full-time professional musicians. These bands are usually represented by an entertainment agency.

Unlike some famous bands, when the cover bands consist of professional musicians they often do not have a fixed line up of musicians, rather they are often made up of a flexible line up of [[session musicians]], utilizing "dep" (deputy, that is, stand-in) musicians where necessary. The music industry is considered by many musicians as a relatively difficult industry to make an income in, and cover bands can be a good source of income for professional musicians alongside other work.

==Music==
Cover bands play songs written and recorded by other artists, usually well-known songs (as compared to "original" bands which play music they themselves have written). There are a wide variety of cover bands – some cover bands play material from particular decades, for example, a 1980s cover band. Others focus exclusively on the music of a particular group, usually iconic groups, and are called [[tribute band]]s. It is not uncommon to find tribute bands performing the songs of [[The Beatles]], [[Led Zeppelin]], [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]], [[Pink Floyd]], [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]], [[Duran Duran]], [[Aerosmith]], or [[U2]]. Some cover bands will play a variety of song styles, from different artists, genres, and decades. Another type of cover band is one that plays songs in a different [[genre]] or style than that of the original composition (e.g., [[jazz]] versions of what were originally [[hard rock]] songs).

Some cover bands perform covers that are of a different musical genre from the originals. For instance:

* [[Richard Cheese]] covers rock and [[Rap music|rap]] songs in the style of [[lounge music]].
* [[Gregorian (band)|Gregorian]] covers [[Pop music|pop]] and rock songs in the style of [[Gregorian chant]].
* [[Gabba (band)|Gabba]] covers the pop songs of ABBA in the [[Punk rock|punk]] style of the [[Ramones]] (the name is also a reference to the chant "Gabba Gabba Hey" from the Ramones' song "Pinhead" from their ''[[Leave Home]]'' album).
* [[Nouvelle Vague (band)|Nouvelle Vague]] covers [[New wave music|new wave]]-era bands with a [[bossa nova]] twist.
* [[Me First and the Gimme Gimmes]] is known for punk covers of other artists, with each album picking a different genre or era (i.e. hits of the 1970s, [[showtunes]], etc.)
* [[Dread Zeppelin]] specialized in [[reggae]] versions of Led Zeppelin songs, with an [[Elvis impersonator]] on lead vocals.
* [[Hayseed Dixie]] started as a "hillbilly tribute to [[AC/DC]]" and has become a [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]] tribute band covering many well-known rock bands in their own "rockgrass" style.
* [[Run C&amp;W]]  performed bluegrass arrangements of 1960s [[soul music]], primarily classics from the [[Motown Records|Motown]] catalog.
* [[Turetsky's Choir]], a former synagogue choir from Moscow is famous for its remakes of music pieces from different styles, ranging from opera classic to pop hits. The band's repertoire usually includes covers only. Some of them are arranged into medleys.
* [[Ten Masked Men]] is known for [[death metal]] covers of pop songs.
* [[The Baseballs]] are a German band, known for doing rockabilly covers of modern pop songs, like "[[Bleeding Love]]" and "[[Umbrella (song)|Umbrella]]".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2166">'''Cut to shape''' is a [[Philately|philatelic]] term referring to a [[postage stamp]] or [[postal stationery]] [[Indicia (philately)|indicium]] (printed stamp image) that has been cut to the shape of the design, such as an octagon, circle or oval, instead of simply cut into a [[cut square|square or rectangular shape]].&lt;ref name=linns&gt;{{cite web | title = Glossary Of Philatelic Terms | publisher = [[Linn's Stamp News]] | url = http://www.linns.com/reference/terms/terms.asp?firstletter=c | accessdate = 2008-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Stamps cut to shape almost always command a lower price than those [[cut square]], and sometimes have little or no value, especially envelope indicia cut to shape.  Although many stamps unfortunately have been cut to shape by stamp collectors, some early stamps were produced without perforations and were often cut to shape by people before they affixed the stamps to their envelopes. This is true, for example, for the octagon-shaped 4 Annas stamp of India issued in 1854, which is most commonly found cut to shape on envelopes or pieces.  

&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:Four annas H3 F2 smaller.jpg|India 1854, cut square
Image:Inverted_Head_Four_Annas.jpg|[[Inverted Head 4 Annas|India 1854 (inverted head)]], cut to shape
&lt;/gallery&gt;

All of the surviving examples of the India 1854 (inverted head) are postally used. Only two (or three) are known cut square; another 24 or so are cut to shape (that is, in an octagonal shape).  One from the collection of the Earl of Crawford was exhibited in the World Philatelic Exhibition in Washington in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060207055505/http://www.washington-2006.org/wrarities.htm#indiaqueen#indiaqueen India's 1854 Blue and Pale Red Inverted Head]&lt;/ref&gt;

The "world's most famous stamp" — the unique 1856 [[British Guiana 1c magenta]] — is cut into an octagonal shape. Consequently, it has been referred to as being cut to shape,&lt;ref name=linns/&gt; although technically that term is incorrect as the stamp design is rectangular in shape.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6728">[[File:Elona.png|thumb|Range of ''[[Elona quimperiana]]'', an example of a disjunct distribution.]]
In biology, a [[taxon]] with a '''disjunct distribution''' is one that has two or more groups that are related but considerably separated from each other geographically. The causes are varied and might demonstrate either the expansion or contraction of a species range.&lt;ref name=Tallis1991&gt;{{Citation| last = Tallis | first =  J. H.| date = 1991| title = Plant community history| volume = 2| pages = 140–43| isbn = 0-412-30320-5| publisher = Chapman and Hall| location = London u.a.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Range fragmentation==
Also called range fragmentation, disjunct distributions may be caused by changes in the environment, such as [[Orogeny|mountain building]] and [[continental drift]] or rising [[sea level]]s; it may also be due to an [[organism]] expanding its range into new areas, by such means as [[Oceanic dispersal|rafting]], or other animals transporting an organism to a new location (plant seeds consumed by birds and animals, can be moved to new locations during bird or animals migrations, and those seeds can be deposited in new locations in fecal matter). Other conditions that can produce disjunct distributions include: flooding, or changes in wind, stream, and current flows, plus others such as anthropogenic introduction of alien [[introduced species]] either accidentally or deliberately (agriculture and horticulture).

==Habitat fragmentation==
Disjunct distributions can occur when suitable [[habitat]] is [[Habitat fragmentation|fragmented]], which produces fragmented populations, and when that fragmentation becomes so divergent that species movement between one suitable habitat to the next is disrupted, isolated population can be produced. Extinctions can cause disjunct distribution, especially in areas where only scattered areas are habitable by a species;&lt;ref name=Ernst2001&gt;{{Citation| last1 = Ernst Mayr | first1 = Jared Diamond| last2 = Douglas Pratt | first2 = Color Plates by H.| date = 2001| title = The birds of northern Melanesia : speciation, ecology &amp; biogeography| volume = 2| pages = 257| isbn = 0-19-514170-9| publisher = Oxford University Press| location = Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt; for instance, island chains or specific elevations along a mountain range or areas along a coast or between bodies of water like streams, lakes and ponds.&lt;ref name=Tomascik1997&gt;{{Citation | last = Tomascik | first =  Tomas| date = 1997| title = The ecology of the Indonesian seas| volume = 2| pages = 842| isbn = 962-593-163-5| publisher = Oxford University Press| location = Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
There are many patterns of disjunct distributions at many scales: [[Irano-Turanian disjunction]], Europe - East Asia, Europe-South Africa (e.g. genus ''[[Erica]]''), [[Mediterranean-Hoggart disjunction]] (genus ''[[Olea]]''), etc.

===Lusitanian distribution===
[[File:Geomalacus maculosus map.png|thumb|The range map of ''[[Geomalacus maculosus]]'' shows a 'Lusitanian' distribution.]]
This kind of disjunct distribution of a species, such that it occurs in [[Iberia]] and in [[Ireland]], without any intermediate localities, is usually called "Lusitanian" (named after the Roman Province [[Lusitania]], corresponding to modern day [[Portugal]]).

Examples of animal species with a Lusitanian distribution are: the Kerry slug ''[[Geomalacus maculosus]]'' and the [[Pyrenees|Pyrenean]] glass snail ''[[Semilimax pyrenaicus]]''. Plant species with this kind of distribution include several [[Calluna|heather]] species (''Calluna'' spp.) and the [[Arbutus unedo|strawberry tree]] (''Arbutus unedo'').

The theory behind the name "Lusitanian" is now discredited; it posited that there was an ice-free land mass that served as a [[Refugium (population biology)|refugium]] off of the south-west of Ireland during the [[Quaternary]] (last) [[glaciation]]. In this refugium, relic fauna and flora from a previous ice-free period survived until the present warmer [[interstadial]] period&lt;!-- wikilink to [[Last glacial period]] or to [[Quaternary glaciation]]?--&gt;. Although the theory is no longer accepted, the term Lusitanian is still used as a descriptive term for faunal elements such as the Kerry slug.
 
Recently a better explanation of the occurrence of the Kerry slug and similar faunal elements in southwestern Ireland has been developed. This new theory is supported by two recent discoveries: the genetic similarity of much of [[Fauna of Ireland|Ireland’s fauna]] to that of northern Spain, and the genetic similarity of much of Ireland’s human population to that of northern Spain.

Mascheretti et al. (2003)&lt;ref&gt;Masheretti S., Rogatcheva M. B., Gündüz I., Fredga K. &amp; Searle J. B. 2003. [https://archive.is/20120629172226/http://www.journals.royalsoc.ac.uk/content/3b9a0gx50hplrm2b/ ''How did pygmy shrews colonize Ireland? Clues from a phylogenetic analysis of mitochondrial cytochrome b sequences'']. Proc. Roy. Soc. B 270: 1593-1599.&lt;/ref&gt; examined the genotypes of [[Eurasian pygmy shrew]], a small mammal, across its range in Europe. The Irish population showed close genetic affinity to a population from [[Andorra]] but not to that of [[Great Britain|Britain]] or other places in Europe. The genetic structure of the population further showed that the entire Irish population of the Eurasian pygmy shrew had originated from a single [[founder event]]. The authors concluded that it had been introduced in the early ([[Palaeolithic]]) or middle ([[Mesolithic]]) [[Stone Age]], by boat, probably from south-west Europe. This coincides with work on human populations, which found&lt;ref&gt;Hill E. W., Jobling M. A. &amp; Bradley D. G. 2000. ''Y chromosome variation and Irish origins''. Nature 404: 351.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McEvoy B., Richards M., Forster P. &amp; Bradley D. G. 2004. ''The longue durée of genetic ancestry: multiple genetic marker systems and Celtic origins on the Atlantic facade of Europe''. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 75: 693-702.&lt;/ref&gt; a strong [[Genetics|genetic]] similarity in make-up between populations in western Ireland and in northern Spain. This would be explained by a human migration from Spain to Ireland in the late [[Paleolithic]] or early [[Mesolithic]].

It seems increasingly likely that much of Ireland’s Lusitanian fauna is in reality an artefact of this era of human expansion in the early part of the Postglacial era. In other words, it seems likely that these species were introduced accidentally with trade items or goods brought by boat from Iberia.

[[File:Le Rêve d'un flagellant by George Topfer.jpg|thumb|200px|This 1921 illustration of a [[clothed male, naked female]] shows an example of [[female submission]]. The art is by Georges Topfer from his work ''Le Rêve d’un flagellant'' ("The dream of a flagellant").]]

'''Dominance and submission''' (also called '''D/s''') is a set of behaviours, customs, and rituals involving the submission of one person to another in an erotic episode or [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]]. It is a subset of [[BDSM]].

Physical contact is not necessary, and D/s can be conducted anonymously over the telephone, email, or other messaging systems. In other cases, it can be intensely physical, sometimes crossing into [[sadomasochism]]. In D/s, both parties take pleasure or erotic enjoyment from either dominating or being dominated. Those who take the superior position are called [[dominant (BDSM)|dominants]]—Doms (male) or Dommes (female)—while those who take the subordinate position are called [[submissive (BDSM)|submissives]]—or subs (male or female). A switch is an individual who plays either role. Two switches together may negotiate and exchange roles several times in a session. A [[dominatrix]] is usually a female [[sex worker]] who dominates others for pay.

It is common for writers to capitalise the "D" in Dominant but leave the "s" in lowercase for the submissive. Many extend this to His/Hers, Him/Her, He/She, etc., to make it clear when they are referring to a Dominant.

==Overview==
The inner conflict and surrender connected with dominance and submission are enduring themes in human [[culture]] and [[civilization]]. In human sexuality, this has broadened to include mutual exploration of roles, emotions, and activities that would be difficult or impossible to act out without a willing partner taking an opposing role.

A 1985 study suggests that only about 30 percent of participants in [[BDSM]] activities are females.&lt;ref&gt;Breslow N, Evans L, Langley J. "[http://www.springerlink.com/content/m7276ut047xg5316/ On the prevalence and roles of females in the sadomasochistic subculture: report of an empirical study.]" Archives of Sexual Behavior 1985 Aug;14(4):303-17. {{PMID|4051718}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eugene E. Levitt, Charles Moser, and Karen V. Jamison "[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7993186 The prevalence and some attributes of females in the sadomasochistic subculture: A second report.]" [[Archives of Sexual Behavior]] 23(4) / August, 1994 DOI 10.1007/BF01541410 {{PMID|7993186}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A 1995 study indicates that 89% of [[heterosexual]] females who are active in BDSM expressed a preference for the submissive-recipient role in [[sexual bondage]], expressing also a preference for a [[Male dominance (BDSM)|dominant male]], and that 71% of heterosexual males preferred a dominant-initiator role.&lt;ref&gt;Ernulf KE, Innala SM. "[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8572912 Sexual bondage: a review and unobtrusive investigation.]" Archives of Sexual Behavior 1995 Dec;24(6):631-54. {{PMID|8572912}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''[[safeword]]'' is usually given to the submissive partner to prevent the dominant from overstepping physical and emotional boundaries. The safeword is especially important when engaging in verbal [[erotic humiliation|humiliation]] or playing "mind-games", because the dominant may not be aware of an emotional boundary until it is crossed. If an emotional boundary is breached and the safeword spoken, the dominant should cease all play immediately and discuss the emotional breach with the submissive in a tender and understanding manner. Negotiating limits in advance is also an important element in a D/s relationship.

It is important to note that for a safe, sane, and consensual environment to be maintained, all participants should have a safeword of which the other is aware; this includes the Dominant partner. While it may not seem so from the outside, Dominants will also have limits and boundaries of their own, and should not only have a safeword but also be comfortable calling it if their own limits are exceeded. This includes cases where the dominant may feel things have gone too far and is uncomfortable continuing. As with any other participant, the dominant's safeword call should herald the stopping of all play and the start of a recuperative discussion between the participants.

D/s may be ritualized or freeform. It is usually a negotiated lifestyle, with people discussing their wishes, [[Limits (BDSM)|limits]], and needs in order to find commonality.  A D/s relationship may be sexual or non-sexual, long- or short-term, and intimate or anonymous.  Most adherents search for the essential intensity, trust, and intimacy that are required to make any deep relationship possible.

Based on gender (of the dominant or submissive), D/s can be divided into the following sub-types:-

* [[Male dominance (BDSM)|Male dominance]]
* [[Male submission]]
* [[Female dominance]]
* [[Female submission]]

==Terminology==
{{Main article|Glossary of BDSM}}
[[File:Folsom Street Fair master and 2 slaves.jpg|thumb|A dominant male publicly holds two submissive females using [[leash|leashes]] tied to their neck, [[Folsom Street Fair]], 2010]]

D/s participants often refer to their activity as "play", with an individual play session being called a "scene". In addition to "dominant" and "submissive", a "switch" is a person who can take either role. A scene between two switches can involve trading off the dominant and submissive roles, possibly several times. In contrast, the terms "top" and "bottom" refer to the active ([[Agent (grammar)|agent]]) and passive ([[Patient (grammar)|patient]]) roles, respectively. In a given scene, there is no requirement that the dominant also be the top, or that the submissive be the bottom, although this is often the case.

The term "vanilla" refers to normative ("non-[[Kink (sexuality)|kinky]]") sex and relationships, the vanilla world being mainstream society outside of the BDSM subculture. The term comes from vanilla ice cream being considered the "default" flavor.

===Linguistic conventions===
Some people in the D/s world capitalize words and names that refer to dominants, and do not capitalize those that refer to submissives, hence the capitalization of D/s; others do not. It was popularized in internet chatrooms, to make it easier to identify the orientation of the writer or the person being written about.

Also, some submissives eschew personal pronouns, instead referring to themselves as "this slave" or "Master Bob's girl". This is sometimes considered an expression of modesty, but it is an entirely optional method of depersonalizing a submissive during "play". It may have roots in the [[military]], where new recruits are required to refer to themselves as "this recruit", rather than "I" or "me".

==D/s relationship styles==
{{ref improve section|date=March 2013}}
[[File:Facesitting-facesitting--Couple--domination--2 large (cropped).jpg|thumb|[[Face sitting]] can be a way of expressing dominance.]]
[[File:Fucking Machines top banner cropped to machine example.jpg|thumb|A [[sex machine]] being used on a woman]]

[[File:Bling-bling - table.jpg|thumb|[[Human furniture]]: A nude submissive woman being used as a decorative table. She is required to stay in the same posture, such that the [[vase]] over her does not fall.]]

There can be any number of partners in a D/s relationship: one dominant may have several submissives, who may in turn dominate others, or a submissive may have multiple dominants. Relationships may be [[monogamous]] or [[polyamorous]]. Romantic love is not necessarily a feature in D/s: partners might be very much in love or have no romantic relationship at all. Some D/s relationships are sexual, others completely chaste.

[[Fantasy role play]] can be an element, with partners taking classic dominant or submissive roles, or classic authority-figure roles such as teacher and student, police officer and suspect, or parent and child. [[Human pony|Animal play]], where one partner takes the role of owner or caretaker and the other takes the part of a pet or animal, can also be D/s play.

A classic example of a D/s role is the [[Feminization (activity)|"sissy" maid]], where an adult male dresses in cartoonish female clothing and performs [[stereotype|stereotypical]] female chores such as housecleaning or serving tea. It should be noted that cross-dressing in D/s does not always involve a desire to be sissified or made into caricatures of women or to serve: for example, others may desire to be made as beautiful as possible and interact on a "girlfriend-to-girlfriend" non-sexual basis.

Variation in D/s is virtually limitless and the activities take many forms, and may be combined with other forms of BDSM. These variations may include:
* domestic [[servitude (BDSM)|servitude]] or consensual [[Slave (BDSM)|slavery]]
* enforced [[chastity]] of the submissive
* [[erotic humiliation]]
* [[sexual slavery (BDSM)|sexual slavery]]
* verbal humiliation
* fetishes—such as shoe or boot worship, uniforms, smoking, latex, and heavy rubber—are, among other activities, considered part of BDSM
* dehumanization (pony or [[animal roleplay]])
* objectification ([[human furniture]]): ex. submissive's body used as [[footstool]], or sub's mouth used as [[Spittoon|spitting bowl]] and cigarette [[ashtray]]
* [[cross-dressing]]
* [[Flagellation|whipping]]
* [[corporal punishment]]
* [[trampling]]
* human toilet - [[golden showers]]
* [[feminization (activity)|feminization]]
* [[cuckold]]
* [[bondage (sexual)]]
* [[public humiliation]]

==Safety==
{{refimprove section|date=March 2015}}

There are some risks commonly associated with D/s.  Because it is mostly a mental activity, many of the risks associated with D/s involve mental health. Others involve abuses of the trust inherent in a D/s relationship.  Some examples are:
* Physically or mentally abusive dominant partner
* Self-hating subs
* Dominant partners who violate the trust relationship by attempting to isolate the sub from society or monetarily exploit the sub

==Consent and contracts==
{{details|topic=when consent can be a defense to criminal liability for any injuries caused, and when, for these purposes, non-physical injuries are included in the definition of [[grievous bodily harm]]|Consent (BDSM)|Consent (criminal){{!}}Legal consent}}
{{See also|Contract (BDSM)}}

'''Consent''' is a vital element in all psychological play, and consent can be granted in many ways. Some employ a written form known as a "Dungeon negotiation form", for others a simple verbal commitment is sufficient. Consent can be limited both in duration and content.

'''Consensual non-consensuality''' is a mutual agreement to act as if consent has been [[waiver|waived]] within [[safe, sane and consensual|safe, sane]] limits. It is an agreement that consent is given in advance, sometimes without foreknowledge of the exact actions planned, though within defined limits subject to a safeword, reasonable care, common sense, or other restrictions. The consent is given with the intent of its being irrevocable under normal circumstances. As such, it is a show of extreme trust and understanding and is usually undertaken only by partners who know each other well, or otherwise agree to set clear, safe limits on their activities.

It's not unusual to grant consent only for an hour or for an evening. When a scene lasts for more than a few hours, it's common to draft a "scene contract" that defines what will happen and who is responsible for what. It's a good way to work out what all the parties want, and usually improves the experience. Some contracts can become quite detailed and run for many pages, especially if a scene is to last a weekend or more.

For long term consent, a "slave contract" may be drawn up. BDSM "contracts" are only an agreement between consenting people and are usually not legally binding; in fact, the possession of one may be considered illegal in some areas.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.loc.gov/rr/program/bib/ourdocs/14thamendment.html 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution]&lt;/ref&gt; Slave contracts are simply a way of defining the nature and limits of the relationship and are not intended to carry legal force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Makai |first1=Michael |title=Domination &amp; Submission: The BDSM Relationhip Handbook |date=September 2013 |publisher=Createspace |isbn=1492775975|pages=162–171 |language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a slave contract is drafted, some celebrate the event with a "collaring ceremony", in which the local D/s community is invited to witness the commitment made in the document. Some ceremonies become quite elaborate, and can be as involved as a wedding or any similar ritual.

==Equipment and accessories==
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2013}}

Some people maintain a special room or area, called a [[Dungeon (BDSM)|dungeon]], which contains special equipment ([[shackle]]s, [[handcuffs]], [[whip]]s, [[queening stool]]s, and [[spanking bench]]es or a [[Berkley horse]], for example) used for play scenes, or they may visit a BDSM club that maintains such facilities.

===Collars===
{{Main article|Collar (BDSM)}}

[[Image:BDSM collar back.jpg|thumb|A typical D/s "slave collar"]]

Many submissives wear a collar to denote their status and commitment. It can be much like a wedding band, except that only the submissive partner wears one. The traditional collar is a neck band in leather or metal, chosen, designed, and even crafted by the dominant partner. Some subs wear a "symbolic collar", often a bracelet or ankle chain, which is more subdued than the traditional collar and can pass in non-BDSM situations. It is not uncommon for a sub to have several collars for special occasions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Makai |first1=Michael|title=Domination &amp; Submission: The BDSM Relationship Handbook|date=September 2013 |publisher=Createspace |isbn=1492775975 |pages=152–161 |language=English |chapter=Chapter 6: The Collar}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dog collars are integral for K-9 [[Human animal roleplay|roleplaying]]—[[pup-play]].

Many people—for example, some in the [[punk rock]] and [[goth subculture]]s—wear collars for other reasons, such as fashion. So, one cannot assume that all people wearing collars are involved in BDSM. Members of the [[furry fandom]] may also wear collars as a part of costuming or as fashion. Use of collars in the sexual aspects of furry lifestyle may or may not be connected to BDSM, depending on the individual's preferences.

==Literature==
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2013}}

One of the most famous works in this area is [[Leopold von Sacher-Masoch]]'s ''Venus im Pelz'' (''Venus in Furs'', 1869), in which the protagonist, Severin, persuades a woman, Wanda, to take him on as her slave, serves her, and allows her to degrade him. The book has elements of both social and physical submission, and is the genesis of the term "masochism" coined by the 19th century psychiatrist [[Krafft-Ebing]].

==Music==
[[The Velvet Underground]]'s song "[[Venus in Furs (song)|Venus In Furs]]" is based on Sacher-Masoch's novel and discusses sadomasochism, the character Severin, and common bondage practices in a detached, objective, and non-judgmental manner.

The [[Rolling Stones]] song "[[Under my Thumb]]" (M. Jagger, 1966) is supposedly about a D/s relationship.

The [[Green Day]] song "All By Myself/Dominated Love Slave" (written and sung by [[Tré Cool]]) describes Cool's feelings for female dominance.

[[Dwele]]'s "Obey" is a Neo-Soul song based on the mind of a Dominant in a D/s relationship.

The [[Run The Jewels]] song "Love Again (Akinyele Back)" is a 2014 hip-hop release with verses about sexual dominance by [[Killer Mike]], [[El-P]] and [[Gangsta Boo]].

The [[Rihanna]] song "[[S&amp;M (song)|S&amp;M]]" denotes the artist's arousal in BDSM play.

The [[DNCE]] song "Be Mean" is written about the artist's desire to be dominated.

'''Elseng''' (Morwap) is a poorly documented [[Papuan languages|Papuan language]] spoken by about 300 people (in 1991) in the [[Indonesia]]n province of [[Papua (Indonesian province)|Papua]]. It is also known as '''Morwap''', which means "what is it?"

Laycock classified Elseng as a [[language isolate]], but noted pronominal similarities with the [[Border languages (New Guinea)|Border languages]]. Ross included it in Border because of these similarities, but noted that it does not appear to share any lexical similarities with the family. However, this may be an effect of the paucity of data on Elseng.

The '''Epimenides paradox''' reveals a problem with [[self-reference]] in [[logic]].

It is named after the [[Crete|Cretan]] [[philosopher]] [[Epimenides]] of [[Knossos]] (alive circa 600 BC) who is credited with the original statement.

A typical description of the problem is given in the book ''[[Gödel, Escher, Bach]]'', by [[Douglas Hofstadter]]:

:Epimenides was a Cretan who made one immortal statement: "All Cretans are liars."

A [[paradox]] of [[self-reference]] arises when one considers whether it is possible for Epimenides to have spoken the truth.

== Logical paradox ==

[[Thomas Fowler (university administrator)|Thomas Fowler]] (1869) states the paradox as follows: "Epimenides the Cretan says, 'that all the Cretans are liars,' but Epimenides is himself a Cretan; therefore he is himself a liar. But if he is a liar, what he says is untrue, and consequently the Cretans are veracious; but Epimenides is a Cretan, and therefore what he says is true; saying the Cretans are liars, Epimenides is himself a liar, and what he says is untrue. Thus we may go on alternately proving that Epimenides and the Cretans are truthful and untruthful."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Elements of Deductive Logic |last= Fowler |first=Thomas |authorlink=Thomas Fowler (university administrator) |year=1869 |publisher=Clarendon Press |location=Oxford |edition=3rd |page=163 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FSYCAAAAQAAJ&amp;dq=epimenides&amp;pg=PA163#v=onepage&amp;q=epimenides&amp;f=false |accessdate=1 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Epimenides paradox in this form, however, can be solved. There are two options: it is either true or false. First, assume that it is true, but then Epimenides, being a Cretan, would be a liar, and making the assumption that liars only make false statements, the statement is false. So, assuming the statement is true leads us to conclude that the statement is false. This is a contradiction, so the option of the statement being true is not possible. This leaves the second option: that it is false.

If we assume the statement is false and that Epimenides is lying about all Cretans being liars, then there must exist at least one Cretan who is honest. This does not lead to contradiction since it is not required that this Cretan be Epimenides. This means that Epimenides can say the false statement that all Cretans are liars while knowing at least one honest Cretan and lying about this particular Cretan. Hence, from the assumption that the statement is false, it does not follow that the statement is true. So we can avoid a paradox as seeing the statement "all Cretans are liars" as a false statement, which is made by a lying Cretan, Epimenides.&lt;ref&gt;[[Liar paradox#History]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://mathworld.wolfram.com/EpimenidesParadox.html&lt;/ref&gt; The mistake made by Thomas Fowler (and many other people) above is to think that the negation of "all Cretans are liars" is "all Cretans are honest" (a paradox) when in fact the negation is "there exists a Cretan who is honest", or "not all Cretans are liars". The Epimenides paradox can be slightly modified as to not allow the kind of solution described above, as it was in the [[Eubulides#Paradoxes of Eubulides|first paradox of Eubulides]] but instead leading to a non-avoidable self-contradiction. Paradoxical versions of the Epimenides problem are closely related to a class of more difficult logical problems, including the [[liar paradox]], [[Socratic paradox]], and the [[Burali-Forti paradox]], all of which have self-reference in common with Epimenides. Indeed, the Epimenides paradox is usually classified as a variation on the liar paradox, and sometimes the two are not distinguished. The study of self-reference led to important developments in logic and mathematics in the twentieth century.

In other words, it is not a paradox once one realizes "All Cretans are liars" being untrue only means "Not all Cretans are liars" instead of the assumption that "All Cretans are honest".

Perhaps better put, for "All Cretans are liars" to be a true statement, it does not mean that all Cretans must lie all the time. In fact Cretans could tell the truth quite often but still all be liars in the sense that liars are people prone to deception for dishonest gain. Considering that “All Cretans are liars” has been seen as a paradox only since the 19th century, this seems to resolve the alleged paradox. Of course if ‘all Cretans are continuous liars’ is actually true, then asking a Cretan if they are honest would always elicit the dishonest answer ‘yes’. So arguably the original proposition is not so much paradoxical as invalid. 

A contextual reading of the contradiction may also provide an answer to the paradox. The original phrase, "The Cretans, always liars, evil beasts, idle bellies!" asserts not an intrinsic paradox, but rather an opinion of the Cretans from Epimenides. A stereotyping of his people not intended to be an absolute statement about the people as a whole. Rather it is a claim made about their position regarding their religious beliefs and socio-cultural attitudes. Within the context of his poem the phrase is specific to a certain belief, a context that Callimachus repeats in his poem regarding Zeus. Further, a more poignant answer to the paradox is simply that to be a ''liar'' is to state falsehoods, nothing in the statement asserts everything said is false,  but rather they're "always" lying. This is not an absolute statement of fact and thus we cannot conclude there's a true contradiction made by Epimenides with this statement.

== Origin of the phrase ==
Epimenides was a 6th-century BC philosopher and religious prophet who, against the general sentiment of Crete, proposed that [[Zeus]] was immortal, as in the following [[poem]]:
{{Quotation|They fashioned a tomb for thee, O holy and high one&lt;br&gt;The Cretans, always liars, evil beasts, idle bellies!&lt;br&gt;But thou art not dead: thou livest and abidest forever,&lt;br&gt;For in thee we live and move and have our being.|Epimenides|Cretica}}

Denying the immortality of Zeus, then, was the lie of the Cretans.

The phrase "Cretans, always liars" was quoted by the poet [[Callimachus]] in his ''Hymn to Zeus'', with the same theological intent as Epimenides:

{{Quotation|O Zeus, some say that thou wert born on the hills of Ida;&lt;br&gt; Others, O Zeus, say in Arcadia;&lt;br&gt; Did these or those, O Father lie? -- “Cretans are ever liars.” &lt;br&gt;Yea, a tomb, O Lord, for thee the Cretans builded;&lt;br&gt; But thou didst not die, for thou art for ever.|Callimachus|Hymn I to Zeus}}

==Emergence as a logical contradiction==
The logical inconsistency of a Cretan asserting all Cretans are always liars may not have occurred to Epimenides, nor to [[Callimachus]], who both used the phrase to emphasize their point, without irony, perhaps meaning that all Cretans lie routinely, but not exclusively.

In the 1st century AD, the quote is mentioned by Paul as having been spoken truly by "one of their own prophets."

{{Quotation|One of Crete's own prophets has said it: 'Cretans are always liars, evil brutes, idle bellies'.&lt;br&gt;He has surely told the truth. For this reason correct them sternly, that they may be sound in faith instead of paying attention to Jewish fables and to commandments of people who turn their backs on the truth. |Epistle to Titus, 1:12–13}}

[[Clement of Alexandria]], in the late 2nd century AD, fails to indicate that the concept of logical paradox is an issue:

{{Quotation|In his epistle to [[Saint Titus|Titus]], [[Apostle Paul]] wants to warn Titus that Cretans don't believe in the one truth of Christianity, because "Cretans are always liars". To justify his claim, Apostle Paul cites Epimenides. |[[Stromata]] 1.14}}

During the early 4th century, [[Augustine of Hippo|Saint Augustine]] restates the closely related liar paradox in ''[[Against the Academicians]]'' (III.13.29), but without mentioning Epimenides.

In the [[Middle Ages]], many forms of the liar paradox were studied under the heading of [[insolubilia]], but these were not explicitly associated with Epimenides.

Finally, in 1740, the second volume of [[Pierre Bayle]]'s ''[[Dictionnaire Historique et Critique]]'' explicitly connects Epimenides with the paradox, though Bayle labels the paradox a "sophisme".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Dictionnaire Historique et Critique |last= Bayle |first= Pierre |authorlink=Pierre Bayle |edition=5th |year=1740 |volume=2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FKs-AAAAcAAJ&amp;dq=epimenides%20logic&amp;pg=PA414#v=onepage&amp;q=qu'Epimenide&amp;f=false |page=414 |accessdate=1 April 2011}}  ''[[Dictionnaire Historique et Critique]]'' at Wikipedia.&lt;/ref&gt;

== References by other authors==
All of the works of Epimenides are now lost, and known only through quotations by other authors. The quotation from the ''Cretica'' of Epimenides is given by R.N. Longenecker, "Acts of the Apostles", in volume 9 of ''The Expositor's Bible Commentary'', [[Frank E. Gaebelein]], editor (Grand Rapids, Michigan: Zondervan Corporation, 1976–1984), page 476. Longenecker in turn cites M.D. Gibson, ''Horae Semiticae X'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1913), page 40, "in [[Syriac language|Syriac]]". Longenecker states the following in a footnote:

: The Syr. version of the quatrain comes to us from the Syr. church father [[Isho'dad of Merv]] (probably based on the work of [[Theodore of Mopsuestia]]), which J.R. Harris translated back into Gr. in Exp ["The Expositor"] 7 (1907), p 336.

An oblique reference to Epimenides in the context of logic appears in "The Logical Calculus" by W. E. Johnson, ''Mind'' (New Series), volume 1, number 2 (April, 1892), pages 235–250. Johnson writes in a footnote,

:Compare, for example, such occasions for fallacy as are supplied by "Epimenides is a liar" or "That surface is red," which may be resolved into "All or some statements of Epimenides are false," "All or some of the surface is red."

The Epimenides paradox appears explicitly in "Mathematical Logic as Based on the Theory of Types", by [[Bertrand Russell]], in the ''American Journal of Mathematics'', volume 30, number 3 (July, 1908), pages 222–262, which opens with the following:

:The oldest contradiction of the kind in question is the Epimenides. Epimenides the Cretan said that all Cretans were liars, and all other statements made by Cretans were certainly lies. Was this a lie?

In that article, Russell uses the Epimenides paradox as the point of departure for discussions of other problems, including the [[Burali-Forti paradox]] and the paradox now called [[Russell's paradox]]. Since Russell, the Epimenides paradox has been referenced repeatedly in logic. Typical of these references is ''[[Gödel, Escher, Bach]]'' by [[Douglas Hofstadter]], which accords the paradox a prominent place in a discussion of self-reference.

'''Françoise Morvan''' (born 1958, [[Rostrenen]], [[Côtes-d'Armor]]) is a French writer  who specialises in Breton history and culture.

She studied literature in Colombes, then at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]]. Her doctoral thesis was in French literature, discussing the work of [[Armand Robin]]. She later wrote another thesis on the work on [[François-Marie Luzel]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lexpress.fr/info/france/dossier/bretagne/dossier.asp?ida=384018 « Dérives bretonnantes »], ''L'Express'', 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

Her subsequent works typically fall into five different areas of literature:

==Theatre==
Her translation of [[Eugene O'Neill]]'s ''[[Desire Under the Elms]]'' led her to translate other dramatic literature, such as [[John Millington Synge]] and parts [[Seán O'Casey]]. She has also created new translations of Chekhov and Shakespeare in collaboration with [[André Markowicz]]. She won the 2006 Molière prize for best theatrical adaptation with André Markowicz for her version of Chekhov's ''Platonov'', directed by Alain Francon.

She also creates shows for Breton theatre troupes, notably ''Le Pain des âmes, D'un Buisson de ronces'' (''Spiritual Bread: of a Thornbush''). She also adapted the myth of ''Sainte Tryphine et le roi Arthur'' ("[[Saint Tryphine#Myth of Tryphine and King Arthur|Saint Tryphine and King Arthur]]") from the writings of Luzel.

==Critical editions==
She published editions of the works of Armand Robin, including his manuscripts, which she first published in their full original form, which had previously been truncated.

She has also published the prose works of François-Marie Luzel (eighteen volumes) by scrupulously adhering to Luzel's manuscripts, given in facsimile and always giving the original text where they exist in both the French and Breton languages (Tales of Brittany, Rennes University Press).

She has also published works by [[Danielle Collobert]], and has contributed over a hundred prefaces, articles and essays to scholarly editions of poetry and literature.

She has also published translations of [[Marie de France]] and the poems of [[Sylvia Plath]].

==Children's literature==
''La Gavotte du mille pattes'' (The thousand footed gavotte) was the first of her books of songs, followed by books of stories ''La Femme du loup gris'' (The Woman of the gray wolf), ''L'École des loisirs'' (School of recreation) and ''Lutins et lutines'' (Elves and goblins). She worked in collaboration with illustrators.

==Folklore==
Editing Luzel led her to continue her research in the folklore of the fantastic and supernatural, especially fairies and elves, as in ''Vie et mœurs des lutins Bretons'' (Life and manners of Breton elves) and ''La douce vie des fées des eaux'' (The sweet life of water-fairies). She considered authentic folk traditions to be an increasingly frail barrier against the commercialization of folklore. She aspired to authenticity by basing her studies on journals giving precise references and citing them specifically in the texts, while including her own form of humour and poetry based on these sources.

She has expanded her work in folklore beyond Brittany to France as a whole and initiated the series "The Great Collections" published by ''[[Ouest-France]]'': it has published the folk-story collections of Jean-François Blade (Gascony), of Amélie Bosquet (Normandy) and Henry Carnoy (Picardy).

==Breton regionalism==
Françoise Morvan has published a provisional autobiographical memoir, which is subtitled  "drifting identity and nationalism in Brittany". She has published on the same theme an article which was reproduced by the Breton Information Group (Groupe information Bretagne, or GRIB), which she helped to found. She defended linguist [[François Falc'hun]] from numerous "telephone harassment campaigns" by Breton nationalists.&lt;ref&gt;Françoise Morvan, ''Le Monde comme si - Nationalisme et dérive identitaire en Bretagne'', Actes Sud, 2002, p 132.&lt;/ref&gt;

Her memoir "Le Monde comme si" (The world as if) caused controversy in Brittany  bewcause of its attacks on the Breton regionalist movement ([[emsav]]). She discusses the arguments about the authenticity of ''[[Barzaz Breiz]]'', the cultural and political movements in Brittany, their [[breton nationalism and World War II|attitude during World War II]], the creation of the unified Breton spelling, the Cultural Institute of Brittany, the subsidies given for the Breton language, the [[Flag of Brittany]], among other things.

In [[professional wrestling]], '''heat''' can refer to both crowd reactions and real-life animosity between those involved in a professional wrestling [[angle (professional wrestling)|angle]], or match.

In terms of crowd reaction, heat is usually used to denote how much of a reaction a [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heel wrestler]] receives, but can also be used for a [[Face (professional wrestling)|babyface]]. Although the term can in some contexts refer to either positive or negative crowd reactions, heat is usually used specifically to mean a negative crowd response (booing etc.), with its opposite being a "[[Pop (professional wrestling)|pop]]" or positive reaction (cheering, clapping, etc.). 

As heat typically refers to a negative reaction that a wrestling character gets from a crowd in a performance setting, it has also become slang for a negative reaction that a wrestler gets backstage from colleagues, management or both. Backstage heat can be garnered for both real and perceived slights and transgressions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cagesideseats.com/2011/8/5/2346505/wwe-diva-melina-talks-about-being-the-most-controversial-woman-in|title=WWE Diva Melina Talks About Being The "Most Controversial Woman in Wrestling," Starts Podcast|author=S.

== Cheap heat ==
Heels can draw "cheap heat" (called "cheap" because it is an easy way for the villains to receive boos) by blatantly insulting the fans, a local sports team, or the town in which they are performing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pwtorch.com/insiderglossary.shtml|title=Torch Glossary of Insider Terms|publisher=PWTorch.com|accessdate=July 10, 2007|year=2000|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606073745/http://www.pwtorch.com/insiderglossary.shtml|archivedate=June 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fan favorites would sometimes do the equivalent, referred to as a "[[Pop (professional wrestling)#Cheap pop|cheap pop]]", by referring to the town (which [[Mick Foley]] popularized) or promising to "win one for the fans". The villains can also draw cheap heat by referring to a mainstream news event as part of their [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Promo|promo]], especially if the event has strongly emotional or political ramifications (e.g. a natural disaster), although they sometimes do not mention it by name. Historically, another common practice of villains to draw cheap heat involves using [[Racial slurs|racial and ethnic slurs]] to offend the collective sensibility of wrestling fans. For example, in 1972, when the [[American Indian Movement]] was gaining momentum, [[Baron von Raschke]] was known to refer to [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] [[WWA World Heavyweight Championship (Indianapolis version)|WWA World Heavyweight Champion]] [[Billy Red Cloud]] as a "dirty low down [[List of ethnic slurs#I|Injun]]" as a means of drawing cheap heat.

Another example of a wrestler using cheap heat was [[Sgt. Slaughter]], who often delivered anti-American promos during the [[Gulf War]] (and [[Gulf War#Operation Desert Shield|Operation Desert Shield]] immediately before it) as part of his [[Iraq]]i sympathizer [[Gimmick (professional wrestling)|gimmick]]; one of those promos came at the [[Survivor Series (1990)|1990 Survivor Series]], where Slaughter insulted servicemen stationed in Iraq for [[Thanksgiving]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.com/Slam/Wrestling/2006/09/13/1837794.html|title=Sgt.

== Canned heat ==
"Canned heat" refers to playing a recording of cheering or booing through the arena sound system or adding it to a taped show, to either amplify a crowd reaction or mask silence from the crowd. Pre-taped crowd reactions from other events are also spliced in with the programming to make the crowd look more energetic than it actually is, or if [[Professional wrestling promoter|promoters]] want a storyline to go in a particular direction.

For example, in early 1992 the [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]] was attempting to [[Push (professional wrestling)|push]] [[Sid Eudy|Sid Justice]] as a villain. During the [[Royal Rumble (1992)|Royal Rumble]] match in January,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/royalrumble/history/19881152//mainevent/|title=Ric Flair (spot No. 3) wins the Royal Rumble Match to become new WWE Champion|date=January 19, 1992|publisher=[[WWE]]|accessdate=April 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Justice – who had become popular due to his charisma – was loudly cheered when he eliminated [[Hulk Hogan]], and commentators [[Bobby Heenan|Bobby "The Brain" Heenan]] and [[Gorilla Monsoon]] picked up on this as a fair act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/92.htm|title=Royal Rumble 1992|publisher=The History of the WWE|accessdate=July 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the reaction was edited in future television replays, with Sid being booed heavily and Monsoon describing him as a "jerk."

Before ''[[WWE SmackDown|SmackDown]]'' went live in 2016,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2016/tv/news/wwe-smackdown-live-usa-1201782569/|title=WWE's 'Smackdown' Will Move To Live Broadcast On USA (EXCLUSIVE)|last=Steinberg|first=Brian|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=May 25, 2016|accessdate=May 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; WWE usually overdubbed cheers on it and professional wrestling magazine ''[[Power Slam]]'' joked that the company has had to "fire up the Fake Crowd Roar Machine™ to add an artificial atmosphere".&lt;ref&gt;"What's Going Down...", ''[[Power Slam]]'', issue 222, March 2013, p.5.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Go Home Heat ==
"Go home heat" (sometimes called "go away heat" or "nuclear heat") occurs when fans boo or jeer a legitimately disliked character or, sometimes, the wrestler playing that character. Go home heat can be given to wrestlers who are viewed negatively, either for their [[Booking (professional wrestling)|booking]], their character, or even their actions outside of the show; thus, both heroes and villains can get this kind of heat. However, nuclear heat can also mean a heel character getting genuine disdain from fans, simply from great character work. This is much less common in the present day, as fans may be more clued in to the inner workings of professional wrestling, and this type of heat is transformed into a pop. This is due to [[Glossary_of_professional_wrestling_terms#smark|smarks]] realizing how good the character work is, and cheering instead of booing.

Generally speaking,  go home heat happens either because the fans feel the promotion has been too aggressively [[Push (professional wrestling)|pushing]] a certain wrestler (regardless of his character alignment) who they feel is undeserving of their push, or because the character has become stale, boring, and uninteresting. While it can be difficult to distinguish the good heat for the villain from go away heat, with some fans and critics claiming it is indeed go away heat and others claiming it is good heat, there are a few example which are closer to be go away heat, most notably in WWE because of its major exposure. Notorious examples of the concept are The Rock as Rocky Maivia, [[Sean Waltman|X-Pac]] (who popularized the term in the early 2000s so much that go away heat is also known as "[[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#X|X-Pac heat]]"), [[Triple H]], John Bradshaw Layfield, Stephanie McMahon, and more recently [[Roman Reigns]] (see [[Persona and reception of Roman Reigns]]).

=== Rocky Maivia ===
Between 1996 and 1997, Rocky Maivia was the first major example of go away heat and also the best example of turning the go away heat into a star by 1998.&lt;ref name="The Rock"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.com/Slam/Wrestling/Bios/rock.html|title=The Rock|publisher=SLAM Sports!|accessdate=July 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hyped as the WWF's first third-generation wrestler,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title= Marc Mero, Rocky Maivia, Jake Roberts, and The Stalker vs. Crush, Jerry Lawler, Hunter Hearst Helmsley, and Goldust|series=[[Survivor Series (1996)]]|credits=World Wrestling Federation|airdate=1996-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maivia was a clean-cut heroic character who was pushed heavily from the start and won the [[WWE Intercontinental Championship|Intercontinental Championship]] despite his wrestling inexperience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.otherarena.com/htm/cgi-bin/history.cgi?1997/raw021397 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061026201823/http://www.otherarena.com/htm/cgi-bin/history.cgi?1997%2Fraw021397 |archivedate=October 26, 2006 |title=WWF Thursday RAW: February 13, 1997 |publisher=The Other Arena |accessdate=March 19, 2008 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/intercontinental/322532 |title=Rocky Maivia's first Intercontinental Championship reign |publisher=[[World Wrestling Entertainment]] |accessdate=March 19, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070410102450/http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/intercontinental/322532 |archivedate=April 10, 2007 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was during a transitional, but more edgy period that would lead to the [[Attitude Era]], therefore audiences became increasingly hostile toward Maivia, with chants of "Die, Rocky, die!" and "Rocky sucks!" being heard during his matches.&lt;ref name="The Rock"/&gt; After suffering a  [[Legit (professional wrestling)|legit]] injury in April 1997, Maivia would return as a villain character in August 1997 by joining the [[Nation of Domination]] and refusing to acknowledge the Rocky Maivia name, instead referring to himself in the third person as The Rock, insulting the audience in his promos as well as WWF television interviewers.&lt;ref name="The Rock"/&gt; The Rock would eventually become the Nation's leader and draw good heat, then starting getting cheered while still being a villain before being officially turned back into a fan favorite character by September 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/wweppv/breakdown98.html|title=In Your House 24: Breakdown 1998 results|publisher=Online World of Wrestling|accessdate=March 19, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/wweppv/judgementday98.html|title=In Your House 25: Judgment Day 1998 results|publisher=Online World of Wrestling|accessdate=March 19, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his time in the Nation, The Rock would get back the Intercontinental Championship and held it for 265 days (the second longest in the 1990s and the longest ever since),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.otherarena.com/htm/cgi-bin/history.cgi?1997/raw120897 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061026202130/http://www.otherarena.com/htm/cgi-bin/history.cgi?1997%2Fraw120897 |archivedate=October 26, 2006 |title=WWF RAW: December 8, 1997 |publisher=The Other Arena |accessdate=March 19, 2008 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/intercontinental/322552 |title=The Rock's second Intercontinental Championship reign |publisher=[[World Wrestling Entertainment]] |accessdate=March 19, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070428234605/http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/intercontinental/322552 |archivedate=April 28, 2007 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; with his second reign being better reviewed and the [[ladder match]] in which he lost the title to Triple H at [[SummerSlam (1998)|SummerSlam]] being rated ****1/4 out of [[Dave Meltzer#Impact|five stars]] by journalist [[Dave Meltzer]] of ''[[Wrestling Observer Newsletter]]'' (''WON'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cagematch.net/?id=1&amp;nr=2034|title=WWF SummerSlam 1998 - "Highway To Hell"|publisher=Cagematch|accessdate=July 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.profightdb.com/wrestler-star-ratings/the-rock-229.html|title=The Rock|publisher=Internet Wrestling Databse|accessdate=July 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite this occurring during the [[The Invasion (professional wrestling)|Invasion]], where the WWF side was mostly portrayed as the heroes, the fans were vocal in their disapproval of X-Pac, which was acknowledged on-screen by both [[The Alliance (professional wrestling)|Alliance]] member [[Billy Kidman]] and later by WWF member [[Edge (wrestler)|Edge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.com/Slam/Wrestling/Bios/waltman.html|title=Sean Waltman|publisher=SLAM Sports!|accessdate=July 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Triple H ===
Between 1999 and 2001, Triple H had a successful run as the main villain of the WWF&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.com/Slam/Wrestling/Bios/helmsley.html|title=Hunter Hearst Helmsley|publisher=SLAM Sports!|accessdate=July 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;—especially in 2000, when he became the first villain to win the main event of [[WrestleMania]] and thus retain the WWF Championship,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pwwew.net/ppv/wwf/march/xvi.htm|title=WrestleMania 2000 Results|accessdate=August 17, 2007|publisher=PWWEW.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as winning the "Feud of the Year" award by both ''PWI'' (with [[Kurt Angle]])&lt;ref name=FOTY&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.100megsfree4.com/wiawrestling/pages/pwi/pwifoty.htm |accessdate=June 28, 2008 |title=Pro Wrestling Illustrated Award Winners Feud of the Year |publisher=Wrestling Information Archive |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080616062707/http://www.100megsfree4.com/wiawrestling/pages/pwi/pwifoty.htm |archivedate=June 16, 2008 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''WON'' (with Mick Foley) and the ''WON'' "[[List of Wrestling Observer Newsletter awards#Wrestler of the Year|Wrestler of the Year]]" award&lt;ref name=WON2010&gt;{{cite journal|last=Meltzer|first=Dave|authorlink=Dave Meltzer|date=January 26, 2011|title=Biggest issue of the year: The 2011 Wrestling Observer Newsletter Awards Issue|periodical=[[Wrestling Observer Newsletter]]|publication-place=Campbell, CA|pages=1–40|issn=1083-9593}}&lt;/ref&gt; due his accomplishments and performances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.profightdb.com/wrestler-star-ratings/triple-h-193.html?year=2000|title=Triple H|publisher=Internet Wrestling Databse|accessdate=July 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dave Meltzer would rank Triple H's [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#D|drawing power]] as the number one of the 2000s.

However, by late 2002 he would be criticized for the Katie Vick [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#A|angle]] with [[Kane (wrestler)|Kane]], with his following feuds with [[Scott Steiner]] and [[Booker T (wrestler)|Booker T]] being criticized as well.&lt;ref name=WON2010/&gt; Thus his "reign of terror" with the [[World Heavyweight Championship (WWE)|World Heavyweight Championship]] (he was the [[List of World Heavyweight Champions (WWE)|inaugural holder]], being awarded the title by [[List of WWE Raw on-air personalities#Authority figures|Raw General Manager]] [[Eric Bischoff]] in September 2002)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Wrestling's Sinking Ship: What Happens To An Industry Without Competition|last=Hamilton|first=Ian|year=2006|publisher=Lulu.com|isbn=1-4116-1210-8|page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt; by December 2002 to September 2003 would often being described as go away heat due his mediocre angles and matches.&lt;ref name=WON2010/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.profightdb.com/wrestler-star-ratings/triple-h-193.html?year=2003|title=Triple H|publisher=Internet Wrestling Databse|accessdate=July 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As result of his go away heat, between 2002 and 2004 Triple H would win the "[[List of Wrestling Observer Newsletter awards#Worst Feud of the Year|Worst Feud of the Year]]" with Kane (including the "[[List of Wrestling Observer Newsletter awards#Most Disgusting Promotional Tactic|Most Disgusting Promotional Tactic]]"), as well as the "[[List of Wrestling Observer Newsletter awards#Worst Worked Match of the Year|Worst Worked Match of the Year]]" (with Scott Steiner in January 2003) and being voted by ''WON'''s readers as the "[[List of Wrestling Observer Newsletter awards#Most Overrated|Most Overrated]]" (2002–2004) and the "[[List of Wrestling Observer Newsletter awards#Readers' Least Favorite Wrestler|Readers' Least Favorite Wrestler]]" (2002 and 2003).&lt;ref name=WON2010/&gt; It would stay with him despite getting in a better phsycal condition and thus having better matches and feuds by 2004&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.profightdb.com/wrestler-star-ratings/triple-h-193.html?year=2004|title=Triple H|publisher=Internet Wrestling Databse|accessdate=July 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.profightdb.com/wrestler-star-ratings/triple-h-193.html?year=2005|title=Triple H|publisher=Internet Wrestling Databse|accessdate=July 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;—due him winning the title five times for a total of 616 days&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/classics/titlehistory/worldheavyweight|title=World Heavyweight Championship|publisher=WWE|accessdate=July 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/classics/15-greatest-world-heavyweight-champs|title=WWE's 15 best World Heavyweight Champions|publisher=WWE|accessdate=July 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;—until he [[Glossary of professional wrestling#O|put over]] [[Dave Bautista|Batista]] (whose storyline building and eventual feud was high acclaimed, winning the ''WON'' "Feud of the Year" award)&lt;ref name=WON2010/&gt; at [[WrestleMania 21]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Plummer|first1=Dale|last2=Tylwalk|first2=Nick|date=April 3, 2005|url=http://slam.canoe.com/Slam/Wrestling/Wrestlemania21/2005/04/03/981982.html|title=Main events weak at WrestleMania 21|publisher=[[Canadian Online Explorer]]|work=Slam!

=== John Bradshaw Layfield ===
John Bradshaw Layfield's push in 2004 that would change him from a predominantly [[tag team]] division competitor to a SmackDown main eventer who went on to hold the WWE Championship for 280 days (the longest reign in a decade) is often seen as go away heat due the push being perceived as forced and undeserving.&lt;ref name="JBL"/&gt; It was noted that Layfield's push came at a time where SmackDown's talent roster was short of heel main eventers due to [[Brock Lesnar]] leaving the company&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Powell|first=John|title=WrestleMania XX bombs|url=http://slam.canoe.com/Slam/Wrestling/PPVReports/2004/03/15/382634.html|work=Slam!

It came to light that then-reigning WWE Champion and top babyface [[Eddie Guerrero]] felt a lot of pressure as he felt he was responsible for the drop in crowd attendance at SmackDown's live events at the time and wanted to drop the title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whatculture.com/wwe/wwe-10-lowest-drawing-wwe-champions-time?page=3|title=WWE: 10 Lowest Drawing WWE Champions Of All Time&lt;br&gt;9.

=== Stephanie McMahon ===
As a villainess, Stephanie McMahon has been able to draw many boos, but her run with [[The Authority (professional wrestling)|The Authority]] from 2013 to 2016, as well as her run as [[List of WWE Raw on-air personalities#Authority figures|Raw Commissioner]], has been criticized and critics and fans alike saw her heat during this period as go away heat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hamlin|first1=Jeff|title=WWE Raw live results: Roman Reigns and HHH, Shane McMahon and Undertaker|url=http://www.f4wonline.com/wwe-news/wwe-raw-live-results-roman-reigns-and-hhh-shane-mcmahon-and-undertaker-209726|website=f4wonline.com|accessdate=22 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=3/21 RAW Review: WrestleMania is going to be ugly for Roman Reigns and why it’s been a terrible WrestleMania season|url=http://www.wrestleview.com/featured-articles/59308-3-21-raw-sad-show-two-weeks-before-mania/|accessdate=1 April 2017|website=wrestleview.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Creative CORNER: Why Stephanie McMahon is not what’s best for business|url=http://www.pwtorch.com/site/2017/03/31/creative-corner-stephanie-mcmahon-not-whats-best-business/|accessdate=1 April 2017|website=pwtorch.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hulk Hogan ===
Hulk Hogan, the face of the WWF that would lead to a [[1980s professional wrestling boom|boom in professional wrestling]] during the 1980s, may be included as well due receiving less positive reactions by the early 1990s, including the Sid incident at the 1992 Royal Rumble, even getting some boos, especially in his early years with [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.com/Slam/Wrestling/Bios/hogan.html|title=Hulk Hogan|publisher=SLAM Sports!|accessdate=July 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was mostly due a stale character, which was turned as a villain in [[Bash at the Beach (1996)|July 1996]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/wcw96.htm|title=WCW Show Results 1996|publisher=The History of WCW|accessdate=April 14, 2008|date=July 7, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; becoming the leader of the [[New World Order (professional wrestling)|New World Order]] (nWo) and eventually turning back into a fan favorite in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/wcwchampionship/304454110315|title=Hulk Hogan's sixth WCW Championship reign|publisher=[[WWE]]|accessdate=April 16, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===John Cena===
Curiously, the last two WWE wrestlers billed as "the face of the company" or "the top guy" ([[John Cena]] and [[Roman Reigns]]) have been linked to have had go away heat, as both have in common the fact to be billed as heroic characters and staying as such despite getting jeers for years, unlike Rocky Maivia who was turned into a villain less than a year after his failed run as fan favorite.&lt;ref name="John Cena"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.com/Slam/Wrestling/Bios/cena.html|title=John Cena|publisher=SLAM Sports!|accessdate=July 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cena had a brief run as a villain between late 2002 and late 2003, when he was turned back into a fan favorite to acclaim, much like The Rock in 1998.&lt;ref name="John Cena"/&gt; Cena would also win his first [[Professional wrestling championship#World championship|world title]] to a pop from the crowd, eventually surpassing Batista's popularity in 2005 that would see him being [[WWE draft|moved]] from SmackDown to the [[WWE Raw|Raw]] [[WWE brand extension|brand]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Ant|last=Evans|title=Power Slam|work=What's going down...|publisher=SW Publishing LTD|id=132|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; By mid-2005, due a change of character not appreciated by fans that would see Cena changing from "The Doctor of Thuganomics" (a rapper) to a more clean-cut character (described by Cena as a "[[wiktionary:goody two shoes|goody-two shoes]] [[Superman]]") who would often "overcome the odds", thus getting his first boos and jeers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oowrestling.com/recaps/ppv/20050821.shtml |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080609224649/http://www.oowrestling.com/recaps/ppv/20050821.shtml |dead-url=yes |archive-date=June 9, 2008 |title=SummerSlam 2005 recap |accessdate=July 7, 2007 |publisher=Online Onslaught |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oowrestling.com/recaps/raw/20051024.shtml |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090730071549/http://www.oowrestling.com/recaps/raw/20051024.shtml |dead-url=yes |archive-date=July 30, 2009 |title=RAW results – October 25, 2005 |accessdate=June 10, 2007 |publisher=Online Onslaught |last=Scaia |first=Rick |quote=Cena's in the ring marinating in a mixture of 75% squeals and 25% boos |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oowrestling.com/recaps/raw/20060320.shtml |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090729015328/http://www.oowrestling.com/recaps/raw/20060320.shtml |dead-url=yes |archive-date=July 29, 2009 |last=Scaia |first=Rick |title=RAW results – March 20, 2006 |accessdate=July 10, 2007 |publisher=Online Onslaught |quote=For Cena's initial entrance, it's high pitched squeals, and the requisite 40–50% boos ... there were significant cheers for Trips, which is the REAL issue in play, here. |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oowrestling.com/recaps/raw/20060403.shtml |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090730063854/http://www.oowrestling.com/recaps/raw/20060403.shtml |dead-url=yes |archive-date=July 30, 2009 |title=RAW results – April 2, 2006 |accessdate=July 10, 2007 |publisher=Online Onslaught |quote=What [Cena] hears is the same thing he heard last night: 10,000 lustily booing the hell out of him, and maybe 5,000 frantically cheering to try to match that volume level. |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the following years, Cena would get mostly real "mixed reaction" rather than go away heat, oftentimes still getting more cheers than boos, with the notorious exception of [[Rob Van Dam]]'s [[Money in the Bank ladder match|Money in the Bank]] cash-in at ECW's [[ECW One Night Stand (2006)|One Night Stand]] (with ECW being Van Dam's "home promotion"),&lt;ref name="SLAM!

=== Roman Reigns ===

The Indian deaf population of 1.1&amp;nbsp;million is 98% illiterate{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}.  In line with [[oralist]] philosophy, deaf schools attempt early intervention with hearing aids etc., but these are largely dysfunctional in an impoverished society. As of 1986, only 2% of deaf children attended school. {{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

Pakistan has a deaf population of 0.24&amp;nbsp;million, which is approximately 7.4% of the overall disabled population in the country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amic.org.sg/ict/external/awards/0202a2_l59attachment2.pdf Pakistan Sign Language – A Synopsis] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120315001919/http://www.amic.org.sg/ict/external/awards/0202a2_l59attachment2.pdf |date=15 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Status of sign language==
Deaf schools in the region are overwhelmingly [[oralist]] in their approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Unlike American Sign Language (ASL) and sign languages of European countries, ISL is in rudimentary stage of its development. The Deaf communities of India are still struggling for ISL to gain the status of sign language as a minority language. Though sign language is used by many deaf people in India, it is not used officially in schools for teaching purposes.In 2005, India the National Curricular Framework (NCF) gave some degree of legitimacy to sign language education, by hinting that sign languages may qualify as an optional third language choice for hearing students.  [[NCERT]] in March 2006 launched a class III text includes a chapter on sign language, emphasising the fact that it is a language like any other and is "yet another mode of communication." The aim was to create healthy attitudes towards the [[differently abled]].
 
Many efforts have been made by the Deaf communities, NGO's, researchers and other organisations working for deaf people, including All India Federation of Deaf (AIFD), National association of the Deaf (NAD) in the direction of encouraging ISL.Until 2001, no formal classes for teaching ISL were conducted in India. During this period, Ali Yavar Jung National Institute of Hearing Handicapped (AYJNIHH), Mumbai, established ISL cell. It started a course "Diploma in Sign Language Interpreter Course".  The curriculum designed for the course aims to develop professional communicative competence in Sign language and ability to interpret professionally. It also focused on the basic understanding of Deaf community and Deaf culture. Later, the course was offered in the regional centres in Hyderabad, Bhuvaneshwar, Kolkata and Delhi.
Besides AYJNIHH, organisations like Mook Badhir Sangathan in Indore and several other organisations are offering ISL classes. Many NGO's all over the India use ISL to teach English and various academic and vocational courses. These include ISHARA, Mumbai; Deaf Way Foundation, Delhi; Noida Deaf Society; Leadership Education Empowerment of Deaf (LEED), Pune; Speaking Hands Institute for the Deaf, Punjab, etc. (Randhawa, 2014) . The associations like Association of Sign Language Interpreters (ASLI) and Indian Sign Language Interpreters Association (ISLIA) were established in 2006 and 2008 respectively for the professional development of Interpreters in India.
The two schools have been established in India which is following bilingual approach to teach deaf students. One is Bajaj Institute of Learning (BIL) in Dehradun and the other is Mook Badhir Sangathan in Indore. 
Apart from the establishment of organisations working for Deaf people there has been a spurt in research on sign language in India. Recent additions are the research studies by research scholars of Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) and University of Delhi including Wallang, 2007 ; Sinha,2003,2008/2013 ; Hidam,2010 ; Kulsheshtra, 2013 . There is also work on problems and awareness of ISL and typology of ISL verbs (Morgan 2009,2010) . Apart from these there have been continued works by scholars on linguistic aspects of ISL as well as on varieties of ISL (Bhattacharya and Hidam 2010, Aboh, Pfau, and Zeshan 2005, Zeshan and Panda 2011, Panda 2011, Panda 2012).
The earnest step taken by the Government of India to promote sign language was establishment of the ISLRTC. However, currently the autonomy of the Research centre is a contentious issue, yet to be resolved.

==Varieties==
There are many [[Variety (linguistics)|varieties]] of sign language in the region, including many pockets of [[home sign]] and local sign languages, such as [[Ghandruk Sign Language]], [[Jhankot Sign Language]], and [[Jumla Sign Language]] in Nepal, and [[Alipur Sign Language]] in India, which appear to be [[language isolates]]. There are also various [[Sri Lankan sign languages]] which may not even be related to each other. However, the urban varieties of India, Pakistan, Nepal ([[Nepalese Sign Language]]), and Bangladesh are clearly related (although, for [[Nepalese Sign Language]] at least, it is not clear whether the relation is genetic, or perhaps rather one of borrowing compounded by extensive incorporation of a shared South Asian gestural base). There is disagreement whether these related varieties should be considered separate languages.

* Woodward (1993) found cognacy rates of 62–71%; he concluded that the various varieties are separate languages belonging to the same language family.&lt;ref&gt;

* Zeshan (2000)&lt;ref name=Zeshan/&gt; proposes that Indian and Pakistani SL are varieties of a single language.
* The [[ISO 639-3]] standard categorises these varieties as three separate sign languages in India and Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Nepal. ''Ethnologue'' (2016), which follows the ISO standard, acknowledges the relatedness of these varieties as well as the controversy over whether they are one language or many.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; argue that the varieties used in Kolkata and Bangladesh are distinct from that used in Delhi, and probably also from each other.

While the sign system in ISL appears to be largely indigenous, elements in ISL are derived from [[British Sign Language]]. For example, most ISL signers nowadays use [[fingerspelling]] based on [[British Sign Language]] [[fingerspelling]], with only isolated groups using an indigenous [[devanagari]]-based [[fingerspelling]] system (for example, Deaf students and graduates of the school for the deaf in [[Vadodara]]/Baroda, [[Gujarat]]). In addition, more recently contact with foreign Deaf has resulted in rather extensive borrowing from International Signs and (either directly or via International Signs) from [[American Sign Language]]. A small number of the Deaf in and around [[Bengaluru]] are often said to use [[American Sign Language]] (owing to a longstanding ASL deaf school there); however it is probably more correct to say that they use a lexicon based largely on ASL (or [[Signed English]]), while incorporating also a not inconsequential ISL element. Furthermore, regardless of the individual signs used, the grammar used is clearly ISL and not ASL.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

The Delhi Association for the Deaf is reportedly working with [[Jawaharlal Nehru University, Delhi|Jawaharlal Nehru University]] to identify a standard sign language for India.&lt;ref&gt;

==History==

===Early history===
Although discussion of sign languages and the lives of deaf people is extremely rare in the history of South Asian literature, there are a few references to deaf people and gestural communication in texts dating from antiquity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Symbolic hand gestures known as [[mudra]]s have been employed in religious contexts in [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]] and [[Zoroastrianism]] for many centuries, although these religious traditions have often excluded deaf people from participation in ritual or religious membership.&lt;ref&gt;Scholar of [[Oriental studies]] [[H. W. Bailey]] identifies passages in the ''[[Avesta]]'' (Yast 5.93) and the [[Vinaya]], e.g. "Excluded from the Buddhist [[Theravāda]] community ([[Sangha (Buddhism)|sangha]]-) were the andha-, mUga-, and badhira-, 'the blind, dumb, and deaf'."

An early reference to gestures used by deaf people for communication appears in a 12th-century Islamic legal commentary, the [[Hidayah]]. In the influential text, deaf (or "dumb") people have legal standing in areas such as [[bequest]]s, marriage, divorce and financial transactions, if they communicate habitually with intelligible signs.&lt;ref&gt;Vol. IV, Book LIII. {{cite book

Early in the 20th century, a high incidence of deafness was observed among communities of the [[Naga hills]]. As has happened elsewhere in such circumstances (see, for example, [[Al-Sayyid Bedouin Sign Language]]), a [[village sign language]] had emerged and was used by both deaf and hearing members of the community. Ethnologist and political officer [[John Henry Hutton]] wrote:

{{quote|As one might expect ... of men without the art of writing, the language of signs has reached a high state of development... To judge how highly developed is this power of communicating by signs, etc., it is necessary only to experience a Naga interpreter's translation of a story or a request told to him in sign language by a dumb man. ... Indeed the writer has known a dumb man make a long and detailed complaint of an assault in which nothing was missing except proper names, and even these were eventually identified by means of the dumb man's description of his assailants' dress and personal appearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

(See [[Naga Sign Language]].)
However, it is unlikely that any of these sign systems are related to modern IPSL, and deaf people were largely treated as social outcasts throughout South Asian history.

=== Residential deaf schools ===
Documented deaf education began with welfare services, mission schools and [[orphanage]]s from the 1830s, and "initially worked with locally-devised gestural or signed communication, sometimes with [[Simultaneous Communication|simultaneous speech]]."&lt;ref&gt;Miles, M.  2001, extended and updated 2006-04. "Signs of Development in Deaf South &amp; South-West Asia: histories, cultural identities, resistance to cultural imperialism".  This is a further revised, extended and updated version of a chapter first published in: Alison Callaway (ed) Deafness and Development, University of Bristol, Centre for Deaf Studies, 2001. Internet publication URL: http://www.independentliving.org/docs7/miles200604.html&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the 19th century, residential deaf schools were established, and they tended (increasingly) to adopt an [[oralism|oralist]] approach over the use of sign language in the classroom. These schools included The Bombay Institution for Deaf-Mutes, which was founded by Bishop [[Leo Meurin]] in the 1880s,&lt;ref&gt;Hull, Ernest R. (1913) Bombay Mission-History with a special study of the [[Padroado]] Question. Volume II 1858–1890. Bombay: Examiner Press&lt;/ref&gt; and schools in [[Madras]]&lt;ref&gt;Report on Public Instruction in the Madras Presidency for 1892–93. Madras, 1893. (Report by D. Duncan).&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Calcutta]]&lt;ref&gt;Editorial (1895), "The deaf mutes in India". The Indian Magazine and Review, August 1895, pp. 436–38. (Quoting largely an article by Ernest J.D. Abraham, in The British Deaf-Mute, May 1895).&lt;/ref&gt; which opened in the 1890s. Other residential schools soon followed, such as the "School for Deaf and Dumb Boys" at Mysore, founded in 1902,&lt;ref&gt;Iyer, A. Padmanabha (1938). "Modern Mysore, impression of a visitor". Trivandrum: Sridhara Printing House. pp 78–83&lt;/ref&gt; a school in [[Dehiwala-Mount Lavinia|Dehiwala]] in what is now [[Sri Lanka]], founded in 1913,&lt;ref&gt;Smith, M. Saumarez (1915) "C.E.Z.M.S. Work among the Deaf in India &amp; Ceylon". London: Church of England Zenana Mission Society. p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; and "The Ida Rieu School for blind, deaf, dumb and other defective children", founded in 1923 in [[Karachi]], in what is now [[Pakistan]].&lt;ref&gt;Report on Public Instruction in the Bombay Presidency for the Year 1923–24. Bombay: Central Govt Press. 1925. (Report by M. Hesketh). p. 91&lt;/ref&gt;

While a few students who were unable to learn via the oralist method were taught with signs, many students preferred to communicate with each other via sign language, sometimes to the frustration of their teachers. The first study of the sign language of these children, which is almost certainly related to modern IPSL, was in 1928 by British teacher H. C. Banerjee. She visited three residential schools for deaf children, at [[Dacca]], [[Barisal]] and Calcutta, observing that "in all these schools the teachers have discouraged the growth of the sign language, which in spite of this official disapproval, has grown and flourished."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Banerjee | first1 = H.C. | year = 1928 | title = The sign language of deaf-mutes | url = | journal = Indian Journal of Psychology | volume = 3 | issue = | pages = 69–87 }} (quote from p.70)&lt;/ref&gt; She compared sign vocabularies at the different schools and described the signs in words in an appendix.

A rare case of a public event conducted in sign language was reported by a mission in [[Palayamkottai]] in 1906: "Our services for the Deaf are chiefly in the sign language, in which all can join alike, whether learning [[Tamil language|Tamil]], as those do who belong to the [[Madras Presidency]], or English, which is taught to those coming from other parts."&lt;ref&gt;Swainson, Florence (1906). "Report of the Deaf and Dumb and Industrial School in connection with the Church of England Zenana Mission, Palamcottah, South India, for 1905". Palamcottah: Church Mission Press. p.9&lt;/ref&gt;

==Grammar==
Despite the common assumption that Indian Sign Language is the manual representation of spoken English or Hindi, it is in fact unrelated to either language and has its own grammar. Zeshan (2014) discusses three aspects of ISL: its lexicon, syntax and spatial grammar. Some distinct features of ISL that differ from other sign languages include:

1) Number Signs: The numbers from zero to nine are formed in ISL by holding up a hand with the appropriate handshape for each number. From one to five the corresponding number of extended fingers forms the numeral sign, whereas for zero and the numbers from six to nine special handshapes are used that derive from written numbers. Ten may either be expressed by two 5-hands or by ‘1+0’. (Zeshan, 2000)

2) Family Relationship: The signs for family relationship are preceded by the sign for ‘male/man’ and ‘female/woman’.

E.g.: 
    i) BROTHER: MAN + SIBLING 
    
    ii) SISTER: WOMAN + SIBLING

3) Sign families: Several signs belong to same family if they share one or more parameters including handshapes, place of articulation and movement.

E.g.: 
    i)PASS and FAIL – The handshape for the sign is same but they move in opposite direction.
    
    ii)MONEY, PAY and RICH – They have same handshape but different place of articulation and movement pattern.
   
    iii)THINK, KNOW and UNDERSTAND – The place of articulation is head which is same for all signs.

4) The ISL consists of various non-manual gestures including mouth pattern, mouth gesture, facial expression, body posture, head position and eye gaze (Zeshan, 2001)

5)  There is no temporal inflection in ISL. The past, present and future is depicted by using signs for before, then, and after.

6) The question words like WHAT, WHERE, WHICH, HOW etc. are placed at the end of interrogative sentences.

  i) English: Where is the bank?
     ISL    : BANK WHERE
    
 ii) English: Who is sick?
     ISL    : SICK WHO

7) The use of space is a crucial feature of ISL.

{{quote|Sentences are always [[Predicate (grammar)|predicate]] final, and all of the signs from the open lexical classes can function as predicates. Ellipsis is extensive, and one-word sentences are common. There is a strong preference for sentences with only one lexical argument. Constituent order does not play any role in the marking of grammatical relations. These are coded exclusively by spatial mechanisms (e.g., directional signs) or inferred from the context. Temporal expressions usually come first in the sentence, and if there is a functional particle, it always follows the predicate (e.g., YESTERDAY FATHER DIE COMPLETIVE – "(My) father died yesterday").&lt;ref&gt;Zeshan, U. (2003). "Indo-Pakistani Sign Language Grammar: A Typological Outline." Sign Language Studies 3:2, 157–212.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Popular culture==
Indian Sign language has appeared in numerous Indian films such as:

* [[Koshish]], 1972 film about a deaf couple.
* [[Mozhi (film)|Mozhi]], 2007 film about the love story of a deaf and mute girl.
* [[Khamoshi: The Musical]], a 1996 film about a deaf couple with a daughter who becomes a musician.
* [[Black (2005 film)|Black]], a 2005 film about a blind and deaf girl based in part on the life of [[Helen Keller]].

An '''inventor''' is a person who creates or discovers a new method, form, device or other useful means that becomes known as an [[invention]]. The word ''inventor'' comes from the [[Latin]] verb ''invenire'', ''invent-'', to find.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=inventor&amp;db=* inventor]. Dictionary.com. Retrieved 1 October 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?book=Dictionary&amp;va=invent invent].  Merriam-Webster. Retrieved 1 October 2017. &lt;/ref&gt; The system of [[patent]]s was established to encourage inventors by granting limited-term, limited [[monopoly]] on inventions determined to be sufficiently [[Novelty (patent)|novel]], [[Inventive step and non-obviousness|non-obvious]], and [[Utility (patent)|useful]]. Although inventing is closely associated with science and engineering, inventors are not necessarily engineers nor scientists.&lt;ref&gt;*[https://www.britannica.com/topic/inventor Inventor].

'''Ismael Urbain''' (born '''Thomas Urbain''', December 31, 1812 – January 28, 1884) was a French journalist and interpreter.

Born in [[Cayenne]], French Guiana Urbain was the [[Legitimacy (family law)|illegitimate son]] of a merchant from [[Marseille]] named Urbain Brue and a [[Free people of color|free colored]] woman from French Guiana named Appoline. Ismael who bore his father's first name as his surname, was brought by him to Marseille when he was eight, and there he received an education. In 1830, his father returned him to French Guiana where he hoped that he would turn to business. However, with the pitiful state of his father's affairs, Urbain wasn't allowed back, and the following year he again returned to Marseille.&lt;ref&gt;Levallois, pp. 31–32&lt;/ref&gt;

After having discovered [[Saint-Simonianism]], Urbain took the road to Paris where he became the secretary of [[Gustave d'Eichthal]]. He was with the Saint-Simonists before embarking with them to the [[Orient]]. He took up residence in [[Damietta]] in [[Egypt]] and taught French there until 1836. The year before he left he converted to [[Islam]] and took the name Ismael.&lt;ref&gt;Levallois, pp. 33–36, 308&lt;/ref&gt;

Back in Paris he worked for a time at [[Édouard Charton]]'s ''Le Magasin pittoresque'', ''[[Le Temps]]'', ''la Charte de 1839'' and ''la Revue du XIXe siècle''.

After learning [[Arabic language|Arabic]] in Egypt he obtained the post of [[Military interpreter (France)|military interpreter]] in [[Algeria]] for which he had applied. He served as interpreter to several generals: [[Thomas Robert Bugeaud|Bugeaud]], Rumilly and [[Nicolas Anne Théodule Changarnier|Changarnier]]. In 1840 he married a young Algerian woman&lt;ref&gt;Levallois, p. 212&lt;/ref&gt; with whom he had a daughter in 1843.&lt;ref&gt;Levallois, pp. 375–378&lt;/ref&gt; His vast knowledge and experience of Islam led him to participate in the Algerian administration at a high level. Having become a member of the Governor General's advisory board&lt;ref name=Davis&gt;{{Cite book |author= Davis, Diana K. |title= Resurrecting the granary of Rome: environmental history and French colonial Expansion in North Africa |publisher= Ohio University Press |year= 2007 |page= 59|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Hwu3S5i-2QQC&amp;pg=PA59 |ISBN= 978-0-8214-1752-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; he took part in most major decisions in Algeria.

In 1845, Urbain was summoned to the Ministry of War and he returned to France where his wife was to follow. Unable to conjoin the Muslim family with the French family he resolved to marry his wife before civil status on May 20, 1857, and the next day his daughter who was constantly being teased by her schoolmates at the private school run by Sœurs de la Doctrine Chrétienne in [[Constantine, Algeria|Constantine]], was baptized. This act, however, was not enough to appease the [[Roman Catholic]] community, made up of Spaniards, Maltese and people from the South of France who composed the new society of colonists in Algeria, who accused him of failing to obtain the blessing of the church for his marriage and the lack of a baptism for his wife.&lt;ref&gt;Levallois, p. 551&lt;/ref&gt;

Urbain has been largely attributed as the source of the arabophilia of [[Napoleon III]] to whom he was a personal adviser.&lt;ref name=Davis/&gt; He corresponded with many key political, military and cultural people in the Algeria of his time. In an 1857 article in ''[[Revue de Paris]]'' Urbain denounced the term "[[Kabylie]]" as an invention due to the French spirit of systematization used neither by the Arabs nor by the [[Berber people|Berbers]] of Algeria. In 1861 he published under the pen name Georges Voisin ''l’Algérie pour les Algériens'' (''Algeria for the Algerians'') where he defends the ideas of an Arab Kingdom that Napoleon III, influenced by the ideas of the Saint-Simonists, had wanted to implement at the instigation of Urbain, but which was fiercely opposed by the colonists and economic interests in Algeria. The renewed attacks by Urbain in 1870 in ''l’Algérie française: indigènes et immigrants'' (''French Algeria: natives and immigrants'') provoked very violent agitation in the colony. The writings of Urbain aroused such passionate reactions that they almost completely overshadowed the ideas which were developed in the ensuing polemics.&lt;ref&gt;Levallois, pp. 620 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

Urbain died in Algeria. On his death [[Émile Masqueray]] rejoined the fight for the rights of the Algerians against the repressive behavior of the colonists.

'''John XII''' was the [[Patriarch of Antioch]], and head of the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]] from 1208 until his death in 1220.

==Biography==
Yeshu, son of a priest called John, was born in the 12th century. He became a monk at the Monastery of the Akhsnoye (Stranger Ascetics) on the Sacred Mountain of [[Edessa]] where he became known for his asceticism. Yeshu was elevated to priesthood before 1191 and later moved to the Shiro Monastery to study [[Syriac language|Syriac]] and calligraphy.

During his time at the monastery he transcribed many manuscripts in Estrangelo of which his manuscripts of the Gospels can be found in [[Paris]] and the Edessene Library in [[Aleppo]]. Yeshu also wrote poems and liturgy leading him to gain the title of ''Yeshu the Scribe'' and he was also known as the ''Short One'' in relation to his height.

Yeshu was ordained patriarch on 31 August 1208 and upon which he took the name John and was frequently referred to as ''John the Stranger Scribe'' ([[Syriac language|Syriac]]:Yuhanon Akhsnoyo Kothubo), referring to his stay at the Monastery of the Stranger Ascetics. John appointed Ignatius David as [[Maphrian|Maphrian of the East]] in 1215. John administered the Syriac Orthodox Church for 12 years until his death in 1220.

'''Kenati''' is a poorly documented [[Papuan languages|Papuan language]] spoken by only about 950 people (in 1990) in [[Papua New Guinea]].  It is also known as Aziana, Ganati, Kenathi.  Specifically, it is spoken in 3 villages located in  the [[Eastern Highlands Province]], in the [[Wonenara]] District of Papua New Guinea.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=gat Kenati at Ethnologue.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

Wurm (1960, 1975) placed it in his [[East New Guinea Highlands languages|East New Guinea Highlands]] family as an independent branch. Ross (2005) could not find enough evidence to confirm this, and left it unclassified. However, ''Ethnologue'' (2009) classified it more specifically with the [[Kainantu languages]], another branch of Wurm's East Highlands.

==French==

[[French language|French]] is the only official—and by far the most common—language in Monaco, a result of the role [[France]] has had over the [[microstate]], since the annexation of [[Nice]] and the [[Nizzardo]] (the territory surrounding Monaco).

==Monégasque==
[[Monégasque language|Monégasque]] is the traditional national language of the Monegasque people (who represent only 21.6% of the total population&lt;ref name=2008census&gt;[http://www.monaco-iq.com/society Monaco IQ (English language)], referencing Chapter One of [http://www.gouv.mc/devwww/wwwnew.nsf/1909$/dfb8c2ae4774e8d9c12575ac0046c0e5gb?OpenDocument&amp;Count=10000&amp;InfoChap= Files and Reports&amp;InfoSujet=General Population Census 2008&amp;6Gb|2008 census (gouv.mc not an English source)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927091928/http://www.gouv.mc/devwww/wwwnew.nsf/1909%24/dfb8c2ae4774e8d9c12575ac0046c0e5gb?OpenDocument&amp;Count=10000&amp;InfoChap= |date=27 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;). It is a dialect of [[Ligurian language (Romance)|Ligurian]], and is somewhat similar to [[Italian language|Italian]].

Because the Monégasques are only a minority in Monaco, their tongue was threatened with extinction in the 1970s.{{citation needed|date=October 2010}} However, the language is now being taught in schools. In the old part of Monaco, the street signs are marked with Monégasque in addition to French.

During his [[Albert II, Prince of Monaco#Accession|accession]] ceremonies in 2005, [[Albert II, Prince of Monaco]], made a speech to his people in Monégasque.

==Italian==
Standard [[Italian language|Italian]] is also a major language in Monaco. Italian nationals make up 19% of the total population.&lt;ref name=2008census/&gt;

Italian was the ancestral language of the ruling [[House of Grimaldi]], and was the official language of Monaco when it was a [[protectorate]] of the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]] from 1815 to 1861. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heraldica.org/topics/national/monaco.htm History of Monaco]&lt;/ref&gt;

Italian is also spoken by [[Caroline, Princess of Hanover]] and her children [[Andrea Casiraghi]], [[Charlotte Casiraghi]] [[Pierre Casiraghi]], as her late husband was Italian.&lt;ref name="biographie"&gt;[http://stefanocasiraghi.chez.com/ ''Biographie de Stefano Casiraghi''.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==English==
There is also an [[English language|Anglophone]] community in Monaco (8.5% of which are from the [[United Kingdom]] or the [[United States]], with English-speakers from other nations as too insignificant and thus listed within the category of "other," below),&lt;ref name=2008census /&gt; in addition to English-speaking tourists visiting the city.

[[Grace Kelly|Princess Grace]] was born an American, and all three of her children (including the [[Albert II, Prince of Monaco|reigning Prince]]) grew up speaking English among other languages.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1K_Q8OytB3k Grace Kelly's last interview, 22 June 1982, on ABC's 20/20]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Occitan==
[[Occitan]] (''[[Lenga d'òc]]'') has also traditionally been spoken in Monaco, particularly when it covered a larger geographical territory, but is rarely used today.

==Other==
[[Intemelio dialect|Intemelio]] is a Ligurian dialect spoken historically from the Principality of Monaco to the Italian province of [[Imperia]].

'''Malayalam literature''' ({{lang|ml|മലയാള സാഹിത്യം

}}) comprises those literary texts written in [[Malayalam language|Malayalam]], a [[Dravidian languages|South-Dravidian language]] spoken in the Indian state of [[Kerala]].

The earliest known extant literary work in Malayalam is ''[[Ramacharitam of Cheeraman|Ramacharitam]]'', an [[epic poem]] written by Cheeraman in 1198 CE. In the subsequent centuries, besides a popular ''pattu'' ("song") literature, the ''[[manipravalam]]'' poetry also flourished. ''Manipravalam'' (translates "ruby coral") style mainly consisted of poetry in an admixture of Malayalam and [[Sanskrit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/359722/Malayalam-language|title=Malayalam language|publisher=|accessdate=15 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then came works such as ''champus'' and ''sandeshakavyas'' in which prose and poetry were interspersed. Later, poets like [[Cherusseri Namboothiri|Cherusseri]] introduced poems on devotional themes. There were also other important works, similar to ''[[manipravalam]]'', in Arabi Malayalam like [[Muhyadheen mala|Muhyadheen Mala]].   [[Ezhuthachan]], a strong proponent of [[Bhakti movement]], is known as the father of Malayalam. His poems are classified under the genre of ''kilippattu''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://global.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/317732/kilippattu|title=kilippattu - musical genre|publisher=|accessdate=15 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern literary movements in Malayalam literature began in the late 19th century with the rise of the famous Modern Triumvirate consisting of [[Kumaran Asan]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.poemhunter.com/kumaran-asan/|title=Kumaran Asan - Kumaran Asan Poems - Poem Hunter|website=www.poemhunter.com|accessdate=15 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ulloor S. Parameswara Iyer]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.poemhunter.com/ulloor-s-parameswara-iyer/|title=Ulloor S. Parameswara Iyer - Ulloor S. Parameswara Iyer Poems - Poem Hunter|website=www.poemhunter.com|accessdate=15 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Vallathol Narayana Menon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.poemhunter.com/vallathol-narayana-menon/|title=Vallathol Narayana Menon - Vallathol Narayana Menon Poems - Poem Hunter|website=www.poemhunter.com|accessdate=15 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kumaran Asan was temperamentally a [[pessimist]]—a [[disposition]] reinforced by his [[metaphysics]]—yet all his life was active in promoting his downtrodden [[Hindu]]-[[Ezhava]] community. Ullor wrote in the [[classical tradition]], on the basis of which he appealed for [[Mohism|universal love]], while Vallathol responded to the human significance of [[social progress]]. Contemporary Malayalam poetry records the encounter with problems of social, political, and economic life. The tendency of the modern poetry is often regarded as toward [[political radicalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/556016/South-Asian-arts/65212/Tamil#toc65213|title=South Asian arts|publisher=|accessdate=15 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Malayalam spelled backward is still Malayalam.

==Early literature==
{{Indian literature}}

===Pattu===
For the first 600 years of the [[Malayalam calendar]], Malayalam literature remained in a preliminary stage. During this time, Malayalam literature consisted mainly of various genres of songs (''Pattu''). The most prominent among these were songs praising the goddesses of the land, ballads of brave warriors, songs related to the work of a particular caste and songs intended just for entertainment. ''Bhadrakali pattu, thottam pattu,Mappila pattu, mavaratham pattu, sasthanga pattu, nizhalkoothu pattu, sarpa pattu, sastham pattu, thiyyattu pattu, pulluvar pattu, mannar pattu, panar pattu, krishi pattu, thamburan pattu, pada pattu, villadichan pattu, onappattu, kummi'' and lullaby were some of the major subgenres. These names were not used historically, but are used in modern times to describe the song genres of that time.&lt;ref name="Panicker"&gt;Dr. K. Ayyappa Paniker (1977). ''A Short History of Malayalam Literature''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Ramacharitham''===
''Ramacharitham'' is a collection of poems written at the end of the preliminary stage in Malayalam literature's evolution. It is the oldest Malayalam book available. The collection has 1,814 poems in it. ''Ramacharitham'' mainly consists of stories from the Yuddha Kanda of the ''Ramayana''. It was written by a poet with the pen name ''Cheeramakavi'' who, according to poet Ulloor S Parameswara Iyer, was Sree Veerarama Varman, a king of Travancore from AD 1195 to 1208.&lt;ref&gt;{{ Citation| last=S. Parameshwara Aiyer| first=Ulloor| title=Kerala Sahithya Chrithram (History of literature of Kerala)| publisher=University of Kerala| place=Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala|year=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other experts, like Dr. K.M. George and P.V. Krishnan Nair, claim that the origins of the book can be found in north Kerala. They cite the use of certain words in the book and also the fact that the manuscript of the book was recovered from Neeleshwaram in north Kerala.&lt;ref&gt;{{ Citation| last=Leelavathi| first=Dr. M.| title=Malayala Kavitha Sahithya Chrithram (History of Malayalam poetry)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some experts consider it a Tamil literary piece. A. R. Rajaraja Varma, who heavily contributed to the development of Malayalam grammar, is of the opinion that Malayalam originated from ancient Tamil. ''Ramacharitham'' is considered a book written during the formative years of Malayalam. According to Rev. Dr. [[Hermann Gundert]], who compiled the first dictionary of the Malayalam language, ''Ramacharitham'' shows the ancient style of the Malayalam language.&lt;ref&gt;{{ Citation| last=Gundert| first=Rev. Dr. Hermann| title=Malayalabhasha Vyakaranam (Grammar of Malayalam language|year=1865}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Manipravalam===
{{Main|Manipravalam}}
While the ''Pattu'' school flourished among certain sections of the society, the literature of the elite was composed in the curious mixture of [[Sanskrit]] and Malayalam which is referred to as ''[[Manipravalam]]'', ''mani'' meaning ruby (Malayalam) and ''pravalam'' meaning coral (Sanskrit).&lt;ref&gt;Ke Rāmacandr̲an Nāyar (1971). ''Early Manipravalam: a study.'' Anjali. Foreign Language Study. pp.78&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Lilathilakam]]'', a work on grammar and rhetoric, written in the last quarter of the 14th century discusses the relationship between ''Manipravalam'' and ''Pattu'' as poetic forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Menon|first=T. K. Krishna|title=A Primer of Malayalam Literature|year=1990|publisher=Asian Educational Services|page=9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R9GbBVfrm4gC|isbn=978-81-206-0603-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; It lays special emphasis on the types of words that blend harmoniously. It points out that the rules of Sanskrit prosody should be followed in ''Manipravalam'' poetry. This particular school of poetry was patronised by the upper classes, especially the [[Nambudiri]]s. Dramatic performances given in ''[[Koothambalam]]s'', known by the names of ''[[Koothu]]'' and ''[[Koodiyattom]]'', often used Sanskrit and Malayalam. In ''Koodiyattom'', the clown (''vidooshaka'') is allowed to use Malayalam while the hero recites ''slokas'' in Sanskrit. [[Tholan]], a legendary court poet in the period of the [[Kulasekhara]] kings, is believed to have started this practice.

The earliest of these works in the ''Manipravalam'' school is ''Vaisika Tantram'' written in the 13th century. It contains about 200 quatrains in Sanskrit metres and is in the form of professional advice given to a prostitute or courtesan by her mother. Each quatran is composed with care and due weight is given to the rules of rhetoric. Several quatrains of this type are quoted in ''Lilathilakam'' by way of illustration for the several rules of grammar and rhetoric.

The most representative of the early ''Manipravalam'' works are the tales of courtesans (''[[Manipravala champu|Achi Charitams]]'') and the Message Poems (''[[Sandesa Kavya]]s''). ''Unniyachi Charitam, Unnichiruthevi Charitam'' and ''Unniyadi Charitam'' are examples of the former type which is known by the name ''[[Manipravala champu|champu]]''. The ''Padya'' (verse) portion is in Sanskrit metres and the ''Gadya'' (prose) portion is mostly in Dravidian metres. Authorship of ''Unniyachi Charitam'' and ''Unnichiruthevi Charitam'' is not known and only a portion of the works is now available.  ''Unniyadi Charitam'', which also exists in a fragmented form, is supposed to be written by Damodara Chakkiar. The ''Sandesa Kavyas'' are an important poetic genre in Sanskrit, and on the model of [[Kalidasa]]'s ''[[Meghadūta]]'' and Lakshmidasa's ''Sukasandesa'', a number of message poems came to be written first in ''Manipravalam'' and later in pure Malayalam. The best-known among these ''sandesas'' is perhaps ''[[Unnuneeli Sandesam]]'' written in the 14th century. The poem is written under the pen-name Amruthanilakshi, and some believe that it was written in 1362 CE. The exact identity of the author remains a mystery, but it is widely believed that one of the members of the [[Travancore]] Royal Family wrote it.

The next work to be mentioned is ''Ramakathapattu'', as it is popularly known, though the author calls it ''Ramayanakavyam''. The author is Ayyappilli Asan who lived sometime about 1400 CE at Auvatutura near [[Kovalam]] and whom P. K. Narayana Pillai, who discovered the full text of the book in 1965, calls "the [[Homer]] of Malayalam." ''Ramakathapattu'' contains 3163 songs in 279 ''Vrittas'' or parts.&lt;ref name="Datta"&gt;{{cite book |title=Encyclopaedia of Indian Literature |author=Amaresh Datta |chapter= |publisher=Sahitya Akademi |year= |page=50 |isbn= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Niranam poets===
{{main|Niranam poets}}
While the Manipravala poetry flourished as a diversion from the mainstream, the tradition set up by Cheeraman of ''Ramacharitam''and the more enlightened among the anonymous folk poets was resumed and replenished by three writers commonly referred to as [[Niranam poets]], being [[Niranam Poets|Madhava Panikkar]], [[Sankara Panikkar]] and [[Rama Panikkar]]. They were influenced by the [[Bhakti movement]]. The ''Bhakti'' school was thus revived, and in the place of the excessive sensuality and eroticism of the ''Manipravalam'' poets, the seriousness of the poetic vocation was reasserted by them. It is believed that they all belonged to the same Kannassa family and that Madhava Panikkar and Sankara Panikkar were the uncles of Rama Panikkar, the youngest of the three. Their most important work is ''Kannasa Ramayanam'' which is an important link between ''Ramacharitam'', ''Ramakathapattu'' and [[Thunchaththu Ezhuthachan|Ezhuthachan]]'s ''[[Adhyathmaramayanam]]''. [[Ulloor S. Parameswara Iyer|Ulloor]] has said that Rama Panikkar holds the same position in Malayalam literature that [[Edmund Spenser]] has in English literature.&lt;ref name="Panicker"/&gt;

===Later Champus and Krishnagatha===
The 15th century CE saw two paralleled movements in Malayalam literature: one spearheaded by the ''Manipravalam'' works, especially the ''[[Manipravala champu|Champus]]'', and the other emanating from the ''Pattu'' school and adumbrated in [[Cherusseri Namboothiri|Cherusseri]]'s magnum opus, ''Krishnagatha'' (Song of Krishna). The language of the later ''Champus'' reads more like modern Malayalam than that of the earlier ''Champus'' and ''[[Sandesa Kavya]]s''. ''Champus'' were mostly works of satire and [[hyperbole]] was a regular feature of it. The greatest ''Champus'' of the 15th century is Punam Nambudiri's ''Ramayanam'' which uses Puranic themes and episodes unlike the 14th century ''Champus'' which were tales of the courtesans. Punam also wrote a ''[[Mahabharata|Bharatam]] Champoo''. There are also many others, the authorship of which is ascribed to him. The later ''Champus'' came to be used for dramatic oral narration by performing artists in their ''[[Koothu]]'' and ''Patakam''. Mahishamangalam (or Mazhamangalam) Narayanan Nambudiri who lived in the 16th century is the author of some of the best ''Champus'' of all time. The most widely known of these is ''Naishadham'' followed by ''Rajaratnavaliyam'' and ''Kodia Viraham''. ''Chandrotsavam'', whose authorship is unknown, is a long narrative poem written in ''Manipravalam''.

The elitist ''Manipravala'' ''Champu'' school disappeared by the end of the 16th century. The average readers without much grounding in Sanskrit had their favourite poems and poets in the so-called ''Pattu'' school. With the writing of ''Krishnagatha'' by [[Cherusseri Namboothiri|Cherusseri]], the validity of the use of spoken Malayalam for literary purposes received its ultimate justification. Unlike the language of ''Ramacharitam'' and the works of the [[Niranam poets]], the language of ''Krishnagatha'' marks the culmination of a stage of evolution. There is some dispute about the author's name and his identity. Some scholars are of opinion that he was the same as the Punam Nambudiri of the ''Champus''. It is widely believed that Cherusseri lived in the 15th century CE and was the court poet of Udayavarma of [[Kolathunadu]].

==Medieval literature: 16th to 19th century==

===Bhakti era===
[[File:Portrait of Thunchaththu Ramanujan Ezhuthachan,the father of the Malayalam language.jpg|thumb|left|[[Thunchaththu Ezhuthachan]]]]
Malayalam literature passed through a tremendous process of development in the 15th and 16th centuries. [[Cherusseri]]'s ''Krishnagatha'' bore witness to the evolution of modern Malayalam language as a proper medium for serious poetic communication. Alongside this, there flourished numerous Sanskrit poets who were very active during this period. The greatest of them was [[Melpathur Narayana Bhattathiri]] (1559–1665), the author of ''[[Narayaniyam]]''. The most significant development of the time took place in the field of Malayalam poetry. [[Thunchaththu Ezhuthachan|Thunchaththu Ramanujan Ezhuthachan]] wrote his two great epics ''[[Adhyathmaramayanam]]'' and ''Srimahabharatam'' and two shorter pieces, ''Irupathinalu Vrittam'' and ''Harinama Kirtanam'' and thereby revolutionised Malayalam language and literature at once. Ezhuthachan refined the style of Malayalam language and it was during his period that Malayalam literature attained its individuality and Malayalam became a fully fledged independent language. Today he is known as the father of Malayalam language and its literature. The ''[[Kilippattu]]'' form he adopted in ''Ramayanam'' and ''Bharatam'' may be a pointer to his recognition of the importance of sound effect in poetry. Ezhuthachan is perhaps the greatest spokesman of the [[Bhakti movement]] in Malayalam but he is more than a writer of devotional hymns. [[K. Ayyappa Paniker]] has noted that "the transition from Cherrusseri to Ezhuthachan marks the triumph of modernism over medievalism."&lt;ref name="Panicker"/&gt; Another important poet of this period was [[Poonthanam|Poonthanam Nambudiri]] (1547–1640). His chief poems are ''[[Jnanappana]]'' (The Song of Divine Wisdom), ''Bhasha Karnamritam'' and ''Kumaraharanam'' or ''Santanagopalam Pana''.

===Performance arts===
The 16th century also saw the writing of some dramatic works in ''Manipravalam'' and pure Malayalam, ''Bharatavakyam'', often described as a choral narration, is a work in ''Manipravalam'' which was used for stage performance. The main development in the cultural field in Kerala in the 17th century was the growth of a new form of visual art called [[Kathakali]], which brought into being a new genre of poetry called [[Aattakatha (performance)|Attakkatha]] consisting of the libretto used for a Kathakali performance. The origins of ''aattakatha'' literature dates back to the 12th century and it emerged as a literary genre in the 17th century. The earliest of the ''aattakathas'' is believed to be a cycle of eight ''[[Ramayana]]'' stories (collectively known as ''[[Ramanattam]]''), composed by Kottarakkara Tampuran and about whose date there is an ongoing controversy. Next in importance are the works of Kottayathu Tampuran whose period is about the middle of the seventeenth century. Since the four ''aattakatha''s he wrote ''Bakavadham, Kalyanasaugandhikam, [[Kirmeeravadham]]'' and ''Kalakeyavadham'' punctiliously conform to the strict rules of Kathakali, they are particularly favoured by orthodox artistes and their patrons. Another poet of this category is [[Irayimman Thampi]] (1783–1863). [[Unnayi Variyar]]’s ''[[Nalacharitham]] Aattakatha'' is one of the most famous works in this genre. ''[[Margamkali]]'' was the form of ritual and entertainment among the [[Saint Thomas Christians|Syrian Christians]] corresponding to the ''Sanghakali'' of the Brahmins. ''Margamkalippattu'' is the song for this performance depicting the story of [[Thomas the Apostle]]. This was one of the numerous pieces of Christian literature that must have gained currency in the 16th and 17th centuries.[[File:Kathakali BNC.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Kathakali]]]]

In the court of [[Travancore Kingdom|Travancore]] king [[Marthanda Varma]] (1706–1758) and his successor [[Dharma Raja|Dharma Raja Kartika Tirunal Rama Varma]], there flourished a number of poets distinguished in several ways. [[Ramapurathu Warrier]] (1703–1753), the author of ''Kuchela Vrittam Vanchippattu'', was one of them. The ''Vanchippattu'' or Boat song is a poetic form of folk origin composed entirely in the Dravidian metre ''nathonnata''. [[Kunchan Nambiar]] (1705–1770), the founder of [[Ottan thullal|Thullal]] and its rich literature, is often considered as the master of Malayalam satirist poetry. Born in [[Killikkurussimangalam]], he spent his boyhood at Kudamalur and youth at [[Ambalappuzha]]. 1748 he moved to the court of Marthanda Varma and later to the court of his successor Dharma Raja. The word "Thullal" literally means "dance", but under this name Nambiar devised a new style of verse narration with a little background music and dance-like swinging movement to wean the people away from the [[Chakkiyar Koothu]], which was the art form popular till then. He used pure Malayalam as opposed to the stylised and Sanskritised Malayalam language of Chakkiyar Koothu. He also adopted many elements from [[Padayani]] and [[Kolam Thullal]] and certain other local folk arts. There are three kinds of Tullal distinguished on the basis of the performer's costume and the style of rendering, viz., ''Ottan, Sitankan'' and ''Parayan''. Dravidian metres are used throughout although there is a quatrain in a Sanskrit metre.

===Prose literature===
There was a great lull in the field of literary creation in Malayalam for nearly a century after the death of Kunchan Nambiar. There was however a consistent and steady development of prose at this time. The evolution of prose literature in the early centuries was a very slow process. In the wake of ''Bhashakautaliyam'' several translations began to appear in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. The prose of ''Attaprakarams'' was meant to aid the Chakiyars in learning the art of [[Koodiyattom]]. ''Doothavakyam'' (14th century CE) is one of the earliest of these works. 15th century Malayalam prose is represented by ''[[Brahmanda Purana]]m'', a summary of the original in Sanskrit. A large number of prose works appeared during this period, most of which are either narrative based on ''[[purana]]s'' and religious works in Sanskrit or commentaries on similar works. With the starting of the first printing presses in the 16th century by Christian missionaries, prose literature received a great boost. Several regional versions of ''[[Keralolpathi]]'', tracing the beginnings of Kerala history, began to appear in the 18th century. Paremmakkal Thoma Kathanar (1737–1799) wrote the first travelogue in Malayalam, ''Varthamanapustakam'' (Book of News). The works of Christian missionaries like [[Johann Ernst Hanxleden|Arnos Patiri (Johann Ernst Hanxleden)]], 1699–1732) and Paulinose Patiri (John Philip Wesdin, 1748–1806) also led to a widening of the range of topics and themes in Malayalam literature.

===Venmani school===
{{main|Venmani School}}
The third quarter of the nineteenth century bore witness to the rise of a new school of poets devoted to the observation of life around them and the use of pure Malayalam. The major poets of the Venmani school were [[Venmani Achhan Nambudiripad]] (1817–1891), [[Venmani Mahan Nambudiripad]] (1844–1893), [[Poonthottam Achhan Nambudiri]] (1821–1865), [[Poonthottam Mahan Nambudiri]] (1857–1896) and the members of the [[Kodungallur Kovilakam]] (Royal Family) such as [[Kodungallur Kunjikkuttan Thampuran]]. The style of these poets became quite popular for a while and influenced even others who were not members of the group like [[Velutheri Kesavan Vaidyar]] (1839–1897) and Perunlli Krishnan Vaidyan (1863–1894). The Venmani school pioneered a style of poetry that was associated with common day themes, and the use of pure Malayalam rather than Sanskrit. The poetry was therefore easily understood by the common man. The works were known for its humour, wit, and lyrical metre.

[[File:Gundert, Hermann (1814-1893).jpg|thumb|right|160px|[[Herman Gundert]]]]
Nineteenth century was not a very creative period for Malayalam literature (except towards the end) from the point of view of imaginative writing. But the foundations for the great renaissance that began at the end of the century were laid during this period. The establishment of colleges for imparting English education, the translation of the Bible and other religious works, the compilation of dictionaries and grammars, the formation of the text book committee, the growth of printing presses, the starting of newspapers and periodicals, the introduction of science and technology, the beginning of industrialization and the awakening of social and political consciousness: these constitute the giant strides towards modernisation. Like his predecessors [[Swathi Thirunal]] and [[Uthram Thirunal Marthanda Varma|Uthram Thirunal]], [[Ayilyam Thirunal]] (1832–1880) and [[Visakham Thirunal]] (1837–1885) were great patrons of letters and were themselves talented writers. Christian missionaries [[Benjamin Bailey (missionary)|Benjamin Bailey]] (1805–1871), Joseph Peet, Richard Collins and George Mathen (1819–1870) were responsible for many works on Malayalam language based on western models. Perhaps the most important of these missionaries was [[Herman Gundert]] (1814–1893). Born in [[Stuttgart]] in [[Germany]] and educated at [[Tübingen]] and [[Switzerland]], Gundert came to India in 1836. He wrote over twenty books in Malayalam, the most important of which are ''A Malayalam-English Dictionary, A Grammar of Malayalam, Keralappazhama'' and ''Pazhamcholmala''. The first authoritative grammar of Malayalam was also Gundert’s contribution (1851). This led to the production of a number of grammatical works in Malayalam. Vaikkam Patchu Moothathu (1814–1883) published his ''Grammar of Malayalam'' in 1876, ''Kerala Kaumudi'' by Kovunni Nedungadi (1831–1889) came out in 1878. This was soon followed by the first history of the language by P. Govinda Pillai (1849–1897) published in 1881. The first work on rhetoric in Malayalam on the European model was brought out by Father Gerad under the title ''Alankara Sastram'' in the same year. By the end of the 19th century two different traditions could be clearly distinguished in Malayalam literature: the western school and the oriental or traditionalist school. Writers such as [[Kerala Varma Valiya Koyithampuran]] represent the confluence of these two major traditions. His major works include ''Mayurasandesam'' (Peacock Message) and the translations of [[Kalidasa]]'s ''[[Abhijñānaśākuntalam]]'' (which got him the title of Kerala Kalidasa), and of Von Limburg Brower's ''Akbar''. Meanwhile, many literary magazines were established to encourage all kinds of writers and writings, such as C. P. Achutha Menon's ''Vidyavinodini'', [[Kandathil Varghese Mappillai]]'s ''[[Bhashaposhini]]'' and Appan Thampuran's ''Rasikaranjini''.[[File:Kerala Varma Valiya Koil Thampuran Changanassery Lakshmipuram Palace.jpg|thumb|right|180px|[[Kerala Varma Valiya Koyithampuran]]]]

In the wake of Kerala Varma's translation of ''Abhijñānaśākuntalam'', several attempts were made to translate numerous plays from Sanskrit and English into Malayalam. These plays were seldom acted. The stage conditions of those days were crude and unfit to project a performance. As if irritated by this imitation plays of low quality, P. Rama Kurup wrote ''Chakki Chankaram'' (1893). Kerala Varma's nephew [[A. R. Raja Raja Varma]] went a step further than his uncle in the promotion of a synthesis between the different trends current in the literature of his time. A professor in the [[University College Thiruvananthapuram|His Highness Maharaja's University College, Thiruvananthapuram]], he had to modernize the process of teaching Malayalam language and literature; this made him write books on grammar and rhetoric (which earned him the title of Kerala [[Pāṇini|Panini]]) and eventually prepare the ground for an enlightened renaissance in Malayalam poetry and literary criticism. A close associate of both Kerala Varma and Raja Raja Varma, [[K. C. Kesava Pillai]] wrote ''Kesaviyam'' (a ''mahakavya'') and a number of ''attakkathas''. [[Azhakathu Padmanabha Kurup]] (1869–1932: author of ''Ramachandravilasam''), [[Pandalam Kerala Varma]] (1879–1919: author of ''Rukmangatha Charitam''), Kattakkayam Cherian Mappila (1859 – 1937: author of ''Sri Yesu Vijayam''), [[Ulloor S. Parameswara Iyer]] (1877–1949 : author of ''Umakeralam'') and [[Vallathol Narayana Menon]] (1879–1958: author of ''Chitrayogam''), all paid their obeisance to this neoclassicist trend.

The developments in prose at this time were very significant, [[Vengayil Kunhiraman Nayanar]] (1861–1895), more famous under his pseudonym Kesari, was one of the first to explore the essay form in Malayalam. He was closely associated with periodicals like ''Kerala Chandrika'' (started in 1879 at [[Thiruvananthapuram]]), ''Kerala Patrika'' (started in 1884 by C. Kunhiraman Menon (1854–1936) and [[Appu Nedungadi]] (1866–1934) at [[Kozhikode]]), ''Kerala Sanchari'' (after 1898 under the editorship of Murkoth Kumaran) and the English Journal ''Malabar Spectator''. His ''[[Vasanavikriti]]'' is considered by historians and literary experts as the first [[short story]] in Malayalam literature. It was published in ''Vidyavinodini'' in 1891. ''Fulmoni Ennum Koruna Ennum Peraya Randu Sthreekalude Katha'' (Phulmōni ennuṁ kōruṇa ennuṁ pērāya ranṭu strīkaḷuṭe katha), a translation of [[Hana Catherine Mullens]]'s Bengali novel ''Fulmoni O Korunar Biboron'' by Rev. Joseph Peet, is believed to be the first novel printed and released in Malayalam (1858). ''Ghathakawadham'' (''Ghātakavadhaṁ'', 1877) by Rev. Richard Collins was the first novel printed and published in Malayalam with a story based in [[Kerala]] and around [[Malayali]]s.

The first novel conceived and published in Malayalam was [[Appu Nedungadi]]'s ''[[Kundalatha]]'' (1887).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/Seminar-in-memory-of-Appu-Nedungadi/article15769229.ece|title=Seminar in memory of Appu Nedungadi|first1=Staff|last1=Reporter|first2=Staff|last2=Reporter|date=5 October 2010|publisher=|accessdate=15 September 2017|via=www.thehindu.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though ''Kundalatha'' is not considered a major novel, it gets the pride of place as the first work in the language having the basic characteristics of a novel. [[O. Chandhu Menon]]'s ''[[Indulekha (novel)|Indulekha]]'' was the first major novel in Malayalam language. It was a landmark in the history of Malayalam literature and initiated the novel as a new flourishing genre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindu.com/br/2004/09/07/stories/2004090700011403.htm|title=The Hindu : Voice of rebellion|first=|last=vdt7|website=www.hindu.com|accessdate=15 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The title refers to the main character in this novel, a beautiful, well educated Nair lady of 18 years. [[C. V. Raman Pillai]]'s ''[[Marthandavarma (novel)|Marthandavarma]]'' (1891) had many distinctions: it was the first historical novel in any South Indian languages, first novel from [[Travancore]], first Malayalam novel to be a part of a trilogy and the first Malayalam novel to have a masculine title. ''Marthandavarma'' was completed even before ''Indulekha'' but could not be published until 1891 owing to lack of finance. The novel recounted the history of [[Venad]] ([[Travancore]]) during the final period of [[Rajah Rama Varma]]'s reign and subsequently to the accession of [[Marthanda Varma]]. The novel had a [[Marthanda Varma (film)|film adaptation of the same name]] in 1933 and was the first Malayalam novel to be adapted into film. During the early 20th century, Malayalam received outstanding novels, either as translations or adaptations of Western literature. The post-independence period saw a fresh start in the history of longer fiction in Malayalam as in many other Indian languages, parallel to the evolution of post-world war fiction in other parts of the world. It was both a break and a continuation. [[P. Kesava Dev]], who was a Communist in the thirties and forties turned away from diehard ideologies and wrote a symbolic novel called ''Arku Vendi?'' (For Whose Sake?) in 1950, challenging the philosophy of Stalinist liquidation of political enemies. It had a special significance in the context of the 'Calcutta thesis'. After portraying the class struggle of farm labourers in ''[[Randidangazhi]]'' (Two Measures) in 1949, [[Thakazhi Sivasankara Pillai]] turned away from party politics and produced a moving romance in ''[[Chemmeen (novel)|Chemmeen]]'' (Shrimps) in 1956. For [[S. K. Pottekkatt]] and [[Vaikom Muhammad Basheer]], who had not dabbled in politics, the continuity is marked in the former's ''Vishakanyaka'' (Poison Maid, 1948) and the latter's ''[[Ntuppuppakkoranendarnnu]]'' (My Grandpa had an Elephant, 1951). The non-political social or domestic novel was championed by [[Uroob|P. C. Kuttikrishnan (Uroob)]] with his ''[[Ummachu]]'' (1955) and ''[[Sundarikalum Sundaranmarum]]'' (Men and Women of Charm, 1958). In 1957 Basheer’s ''[[Pathummayude Aadu]]'' (Pathumma’s Goat) brought in a new kind of prose tale, which perhaps only Basheer could handle with dexterity. The fifties thus mark the evolution of a new kind of fiction, which had its impact on the short stories as well. This was the auspicious moment for the entry of [[M. T. Vasudevan Nair]] and [[T. Padmanabhan]] upon the scene. Front runners in the post-modern trend include [[Kakkanadan]], [[O. V. Vijayan]], [[M. Mukundan]] and [[Anand (writer)|Anand]].

'''Middle Persian''' also known as '''Pahlavi''' or '''Parsik''' (𐭯𐭠𐭫𐭮𐭩𐭪 pārsīg), is the [[Iranian languages#Middle Iranian languages|Middle Iranian language]] or [[ethnolect]] of southwestern Iran that during the [[Sasanian Empire]] (224–654) became a [[Prestige (sociolinguistics)|prestige dialect]] and so came to be spoken in other regions of the empire as well. Middle Persian is classified as a [[Western Iranian languages|Western Iranian language]]. It descends from [[Old Persian]] and is the linguistic ancestor of [[Persian language#Modern Persian|Modern Persian]].

Traces of Middle Persian, or Parsik, are found in remnants of Sasanian inscriptions and Egyptian [[papyrus|papyri]], coins and seals, fragments of Manichaean writings, and treatises and Zoroastrian books from the Sasanian era, as well as in the post-Sasanian Zoroastrian variant of the language sometimes known as '''Pahlavi''', which originally referred to the [[Pahlavi scripts]],&lt;ref name="LLDescrip"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also [http://www.omniglot.com/writing/mpersian.htm Omniglot.com's page on Middle Persian scripts]&lt;/ref&gt; and that was also the preferred writing system for several other Middle Iranian languages. Aside from the [[Aramaic alphabet]]-derived Pahlavi script,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last1=Spooner|first1=Brian|authorlink1=Brian Spooner|last2=Hanaway|first2=William L.|title=Literacy in the Persianate World: Writing and the Social Order|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CjibFs9JlgoC&amp;pg=PR4|year=2012|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|isbn=1-934536-56-3}}, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; Zoroastrian Middle Persian was occasionally also written in [[Pazend]], a system derived from the [[Avestan alphabet]] that, unlike Pahlavi, indicated vowels and did not employ [[logogram]]s. Manichaean Middle Persian texts were written in the [[Manichaean alphabet]], which also derives from Aramaic but in an Eastern Iranian form via the [[Sogdian alphabet]].

==Name==

"Middle Iranian" is the name given to middle stage of development of the [[Iranian languages|numerous Iranian languages and dialects]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Henning|first=Walter Bruno|year=1958|title=Mitteliranisch|series=Handbuch der Orientalistik I, IV, I|location=Leiden|publisher=Brill}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1}} The middle stage of Iranian languages begins around 450 BCE and ends around 650 CE. One of those Middle Iranian languages is Middle Persian, i.e. the middle stage of the language of the Persians, an Iranian peoples of [[Persis|Persia proper]], which lies in the south-western highlands on the border with Babylonia. The Persians called their language ''Parsik'', meaning "Persian".

Another Middle Iranian language was [[Parthian language|Parthian]], i.e. the language of the northwestern Iranian peoples of [[Parthia|Parthia proper]], which lies along the southern/south-eastern edge of the Caspian sea and is adjacent to the boundary between western and eastern Iranian languages. The Parthians called their language ''Parthawik'', meaning "Parthian". Via regular sound changes ''Parthawik'' became ''Pahlawik'', from which the word 'Pahlavi' eventually evolved.  The ''-ik'' in ''parsik'' and ''parthawik'' was a regular Middle Iranian [[wikt:appurtenance|appurtenant]] suffix for "pertaining to". The New Persian equivalent of ''-ik'' is ''-i''.

When the [[Parthian Empire|Arsacids]] (who were Parthians) came to power in the 3rd-century BCE, they inherited the use of written Greek (from the successors of Alexander the Great) as the language of government. Under the cultural influence of the Greeks ([[Hellenization]]), some Middle Iranian languages, such as [[Bactrian language|Bactrian]], also had begun to be written in Greek script. But yet other Middle Iranian languages began to be written in a script derived from [[Aramaic script|Aramaic]]. This occurred primarily because ''written'' Aramaic had previously been the written language of government of the former [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenids]], and the government scribes had carried that practice all over the empire. This practice had led to others adopting Imperial Aramaic as the language of communications, both between Iranians and non-Iranians, as well as between Iranians.&lt;ref name="IGCHI"&gt;{{citation|last=Gershevitch|first=Ilya|chapter=Bactrian Literature|pages=1250-1260|title=The Seleucid, Parthian and Sassanian Periods|series=Cambridge History of Iran, Vol. 3(2)|editor-last=Yarshatar|editor-first=Ehsan|year=1983|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-24693-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1251-1253}} The transition from Imperial Aramaic to Middle Iranian took place very slowly, with a slow increase of more and more Iranian words so that Aramaic with Iranian elements gradually changed into Iranian with Aramaic elements.&lt;ref name="PWL"&gt;{{citation|last=Boyce|first=Mary|chapter=Parthian Writings and Literature|pages=1151-1165|title=The Seleucid, Parthian and Sassanian Periods|series=Cambridge History of Iran, Vol. 3(2)|editor-last=Yarshatar|editor-first=Ehsan|year=1983|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-24693-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1151}} Under Arsacid [[hegemony]], this Aramaic-derived writing system for Iranian languages came to be associated with the Parthians in particular (it may have originated in the Parthian chancellories&lt;ref name="PWL" /&gt;{{rp|1151}}), and thus the writing system came to be called ''pahlavi'' "Parthian" too.&lt;ref name="Boyce_MPL" /&gt;{{rp|33}}

Aside from Parthian, Aramaic-derived writing was adopted for at least four other Middle Iranian languages, one of which was Middle Persian. In the 3rd-century CE, the Parthian Arsacids were overthrown by the Sassanids, who were natives of the south-west and thus spoke Middle Persian as their native language. Under Sassanid hegemony, the Middle Persian language became a [[prestige dialect]] and thus also came to be used by non-Persian Iranians. In the 7th-century, the Sassanids were overthrown by the Arabs. Under Arab influence, Iranian languages began be written in [[Arabic script]] (adapted to Iranian phonology), while Middle Persian began to rapidly evolve into New Persian and the name ''parsik'' became Arabicized ''farsi''. Not all Iranians were comfortable with these Arabic-influenced developments, in particular, members of the literate elite, which in Sassanid times consisted primarily of Zoroastrian priests. Those former elites vigorously rejected what they perceived as '[[Aniran|Un-Iran]]ian', and continued to use the "old" language (i.e. Middle Persian) and Aramaic-derived writing system.&lt;ref name="Boyce_MPL" /&gt;{{rp|33}} In time, the name of the writing system, ''pahlavi'' "Parthian", began to be applied to the "old" Middle Persian language as well, thus distinguishing it from the "new" language, ''farsi''.&lt;ref name="Boyce_MPL"&gt;{{citation|last=Boyce|first=Mary|year=1968|title=
Middle Persian Literature|series=Handbuch der Orientalistik 1, IV, 2|location=Leiden|publisher=Brill|pages=31-66}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|32-33}} Consequently, 'pahlavi' came to denote the particularly Zoroastrian, exclusively written, late form of Middle Persian.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Cereti|first=Carlo|year=2009|chapter=Pahlavi Literature|title=Encyclopedia Iranica|publisher=(online edition)}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Since almost all surviving [[Middle Persian literature]] is in this particular late form of exclusively written Zoroastrian Middle Persian, in popular imagination the term 'Pahlavi' became synonymous with Middle Persian itself. 

The [[ISO 639]] language code for Middle Persian is ''pal'', which reflects the post-Sasanian era use of the term Pahlavi to refer to the language and not only the script.

==Transition from Old Persian==
{{History of the Persian language}}
In the classification of the Iranian languages, the Middle Period includes those languages which were common in Iran from the fall of the [[Achaemenid Empire]] in the fourth century BCE up to the fall of the Sasanian Empire in the seventh century CE.

The most important and distinct development in the structure of Iranian languages of this period is the transformation from the synthetic form of the Old Period ([[Old Persian]] and [[Avestan]]) to an [[Analytic language|analytic]] form:
* [[noun]]s, [[pronoun]]s, and [[adjective]]s lost their [[Grammatical case|case]] [[inflection]]s
* [[preposition]]s were used to indicate the different roles of words.
* many [[Grammatical tense|tenses]] began to be formed from a composite form

==Transition to New Persian==
The modern-day descendant of Middle Persian is [[Persian language#New Persian|New Persian]]. The changes between late Middle and Early New Persian were very gradual, and in the 10th-11th centuries, Middle Persian texts were still intelligible to speakers of Early New Persian.  However, there are definite differences that had taken place already by the 10th century:

* Sound changes, such as
**the dropping of unstressed initial vowels
**the [[epenthesis]] of vowels in initial consonant clusters
**the loss of -g when word final
**change of initial w- to either b- or (gw- → g-)
* Changes in the verbal system, notably the loss of distinctive subjunctive and optative forms, and the increasing use of verbal prefixes to express verbal moods
* Changes in the vocabulary, particularly the establishment of a [[stratum (linguistics)|superstratum or adstratum]] of Arabic loanwords replacing many Aramaic loans and native terms.
* The substitution of Arabic script for Pahlavi script.

==Surviving literature==

''Pahlavi Middle Persian'' is the language of quite a large body of literature which details the traditions and prescriptions of [[Zoroastrianism]], which was the state religion of Sasanian Iran (224 to c. 650) before the [[Muslim conquest of Persia]]. The earliest texts in Zoroastrian Middle Persian were probably written down in late Sasanian times (6th–7th centuries), although they represent the codification of earlier oral tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Sundermann, Werner. 1989. Mittelpersisch. P. 141. In ''Compendium Linguarum Iranicarum'' (ed. Rüdiger Schmidt).&lt;/ref&gt; However, most texts, including the translated versions of the Zoroastrian canon, date from the ninth to the 11th century, when Middle Persian had long ceased to be a spoken language, so they reflect the state of affairs in living Middle Persian only indirectly. The surviving manuscripts are usually 14th-century copies.&lt;ref name="LLDescrip"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://linguistlist.org/forms/langs/LLDescription.cfm?code=pal|title=Linguist List - Description of Pehlevi|year=2007|publisher=Eastern Michigan University|location=Detroit}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other, less abundantly attested varieties are ''Manichaean Middle Persian'', used for a sizable amount of [[Manichaeism|Manichaean]] religious writings, including many theological texts, [[homily|homilies]] and hymns (3rd–9th, possibly 13th century), and the Middle Persian of the [[Church of the East]], evidenced in the [[Pahlavi Psalter]] (7th century); these were used until the beginning of the second millennium in many places in Central Asia, including [[Turpan]] and even localities in [[South India]].&lt;ref&gt;Sundermann, Werner. 1989. Mittelpersisch. P. 138. In ''Compendium Linguarum Iranicarum'' (ed. Rüdiger Schmidt).&lt;/ref&gt; All three differ minimally from one another and indeed the less ambiguous and archaizing scripts of the latter two have helped to elucidate some aspects of the Sasanian-era pronunciation of the former.&lt;ref&gt;Sundermann, Werner. 1989. Mittelpersisch. P. 143. In ''Compendium Linguarum Iranicarum'' (ed. Rüdiger Schmidt).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comparison of Middle Persian and Modern Persian vocabulary===

There are a number of phonological differences between Middle Persian and New Persian. The long vowels of Middle Persian did not survive in many present-day dialects. Also, initial [[consonant cluster]]s were very common in Middle Persian (e.g. {{linktext|سپاس}} '''sp'''ās "thanks"). However, [[Persian language#New Persian|New Persian]] does not allow initial consonant clusters, whereas final consonant clusters are common (e.g. {{linktext|اسب}} a'''sb''' "horse").

&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Since many long vowels of Middle Persian did not survive, a number of [[homophone]]s were created in New Persian. For example, ''šir'' and ''šer'', meaning "milk" and "lion", respectively, are now both pronounced ''šir''. In this case, the correct pronunciation has been preserved in Kurdish and Tajiki.&lt;ref&gt;Strazny, P. (2005). Encyclopedia of linguistics (p. 325). New York: Fitzroy Dearborn.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Middle Persian loanwords in other languages===

There is a number of [[List of English words of Persian origin|Persian loanwords in English]], many of which can be traced to Middle Persian. The lexicon of [[Classical Arabic]] also contains many borrowings from Middle Persian. In such borrowings Iranian consonants that sound foreign to Arabic, ''g'', ''č'', ''p'', and ''ž'', have been replaced by ''q/k'', ''j'', ''š'', ''f/b'', and ''s/z''. Here is a parallel word list of such terms:&lt;ref name=PahDic&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Mackenzie|first=D.

In [[semiotics]] the '''neutral level''' of a sign is the "trace" left behind; the physical or material creation or remains of [[esthesic and poietic]] processes, levels, and analyses of symbolic forms. A part of all [[sign (semiotics)|signs]] according to a tri-partitional definition, it corresponds to Saussure's "sound-image" (or "signified", thus Pierce's "representamen").

Thus, "a symbolic form...is not some 'intermediary' in a process of 'communication' that transmits the meaning intended by the author to the audience; it is instead the result of a complex ''process'' of creation (the [[poetic]] process) that has to do with the form as well as the content of the work; it is also the point of departure for a complex process of reception (the esthesic process that ''reconstructs'' a 'message.')" (Nattiez 1990, p.&amp;nbsp;17)

An '''immanent description''' is an analysis of the neutral level (Nattiez 1990, p.&amp;nbsp;75).

== Applied Semiotics ==

In an applied [[semiology]] the neutral level of a [[Sign (semiotics)|sign]] is the "[[trace (semiology)|trace]]" left behind by a [[Spirituality|spiritual]] or [[perfect|ideal]] creation (i.e. [[art]], [[masterpiece]] etc.); or fruits of creative processes and multi-staged levels of realisations, including analysis of the qualities of the [[ashtamangala|symbol]]ic forms as a consequence of an [[arousement]] of the analyst's or [[artist]]'s mindfullness as one of several factors for reaching an understandment of the neutral level of applied semiology depending on the frames of reference (i.e. [[Human body|corporeal]]/physical, [[emotional]]/[[Resource distribution|distribution]] of resources - [[economy]], [[intellectual]]/[[mind|cerebral]], [[artistic]]/[[Spirituality|spiritual]]."

== The Neutral level of the Neutral level ==

"Neutral" comes from the English word&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/neuter neuter - Definition from the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  refers to a mutually understood non-dual background. "Neuter" has been used since the 14th century and is composed of ''ne'' meaning "not" + ''uter'' meaning ''which of two'', thus synonymous with either [1] The Neutral state is often misinterpreted as a passive state, but it should be understood as much not-passive as not-active or equal. It literally refers to the [[non-dual]] state of [[body and mind]], you and me or of any [[wikt:conflict|conflict]].

''Royal suite redirects here. For the 1976 Canadian comedy-drama television miniseries called Royal suite, see [[Royal Suite (TV series)]]''

'''Presidential suite''' and '''Royal suite''' are common names for the most expensive [[suite (hotel)|suite]] in a luxury hotel.

The Presidential suite gained its name during the [[Woodrow Wilson]] presidency (1913–1921) because on each of his political trips away from [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]], he would insist on having a hotel room conform to specific requirements for his visit. In the United States, Presidential Suites since have adhered by tradition to Woodrow Wilson's specifications. It must be south-facing in the [[Northern Hemisphere]] and north-facing in the [[Southern Hemisphere]], containing an "en-suite" bathroom and walk-in closet (in Wilson's era en-suite bathrooms were uncommon). Famous presidential suites can be found in the [[Plaza Hotel]] in New York City, and [[Fairmont San Francisco|The Fairmont San Francisco]].

Royal suites can often signify that Royalty have stayed at that suite in the past. Royal suites are more common in hotels in countries with monarchies, such as the [[The Ritz London Hotel|Ritz Hotel London]].

A very small number of hotels have both a Presidential and a Royal suite. In these instances, usually both suites are of a comparative size and price, but differ in style and facilities. Royal suites may be more classically furnished, while Presidential suites may be more modern in appearance. Presidential suites may have facilities such as a private conference room, while Royal suites may have a formal reception room instead. 

People sometimes reside in these suites on a permanent basis, such as wealthy families that enjoy this type of suite in a semi-private manner for special rates.

In [[mathematics]], [[computer science]], and [[logic]], '''rewriting''' covers a wide range of (potentially [[deterministic computation|non-deterministic]]) methods of replacing subterms of a [[well-formed formula|formula]] with other terms. The objects of focus for this article include '''rewriting systems''' (also known as '''rewrite systems''', '''rewrite engines'''&lt;ref name="SculthorpeFrisby2014"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sculthorpe |first1=Neil |last2=Frisby |first2=Nicolas |last3=Gill |first3=Andy |title=The Kansas University rewrite engine |journal=[[Journal of Functional Programming]] |volume=24 |issue=4 |year=2014 |pages=434–473 |issn=0956-7968 |doi=10.1017/S0956796814000185}}&lt;/ref&gt; or '''reduction systems'''). In their most basic form, they consist of a set of objects, plus relations on how to transform those objects.

Rewriting can be [[non-deterministic algorithm|non-deterministic]]. One rule to rewrite a term could be applied in many different ways to that term, or more than one rule could be applicable. Rewriting systems then do not provide an [[algorithm]] for changing one term to another, but a set of possible rule applications. When combined with an appropriate algorithm, however, rewrite systems can be viewed as [[computer program]]s, and several [[automated theorem proving|theorem prover]]s&lt;ref&gt;Hsiang, Jieh, et al. "[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0743106692900477 The term rewriting approach to automated theorem proving]." The Journal of Logic Programming 14.1-2 (1992): 71–99.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[declarative programming language]]s are based on term rewriting.&lt;ref&gt;Frühwirth, Thom. "[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0743106698100055 Theory and practice of constraint handling rules.]" The Journal of Logic Programming 37.1 (1998): 95–138.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clavel, Manuel, et al. "[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304397501003590 Maude: Specification and programming in rewriting logic.]" Theoretical Computer Science 285.2 (2002): 187–243.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Intuitive examples ==
&lt;!-- Commented out because the example lack the rewriting rules are simply confusing.
=== Arithmetic ===
Consider the rules of regular arithmetic. We can think of these rules as forming a rewriting system, with rules including:
: &lt;math&gt; \mathrm{plus}(a, b) \rightarrow a + b&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; \mathrm{times}(a, b) \rightarrow a \times b&lt;/math&gt;
where ''a''+''b'' denotes the sum of ''a'' and ''b'', and ''a'' &amp;times; ''b'' denotes the product of ''a'' and ''b''.

Suppose we are given the expression
: &lt;math&gt; \mathrm{times}(\mathrm{plus}(11,9), \mathrm{plus}(2,4))&lt;/math&gt;
We can rewrite this expression in two ways, simplifying either the first bracket or the second. Simplifying the first bracket, we have
: &lt;math&gt; \mathrm{times}(20, \mathrm{plus}(2, 4)) = \mathrm{times}(20, 6) = 120&lt;/math&gt;
Simplifying the second gives
: &lt;math&gt; \mathrm{times}(\mathrm{plus}(11,9), 6) = \mathrm{times}(20, 6) = 120.&lt;/math&gt;

=== Basic algebra ===
Rewrite systems provide a convenient method of [[automating theorem proving]]. If we begin with a set of [[equational logic|equational]] hypotheses, then these may be used to formulate a set of rewrite rules. An example from school [[algebra]] goes under the heading ''collect [[like terms]]'' in an equation. There will usually be several ways to proceed, in collecting up and simplifying an equation

:''P''(''x'') = ''Q''(''x'')

in which ''P'' and ''Q'' are [[polynomial]]s. After some application of the conventional rules of algebra we may end with an equation

:''R''(''x'') = 0.

This is something like a [[normal form (term rewriting)|normal form]], though we may well have different signs (at least) for ''R'' found by different routes. If we insist that ''R'' is [[monic polynomial|monic]] there is actually a normal form (as is usually tacitly assumed) in which ''R''(''x'') is written in terms of decreasing powers of ''x''.
--&gt;

=== Logic ===
In [[logic]], the procedure for obtaining the [[conjunctive normal form]] (CNF) of a formula can be implemented as a rewriting system.&lt;ref name="MarriottStuckey1998"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Kim Marriott|author2=Peter J. Stuckey|title=Programming with Constraints: An Introduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jBYAleHTldsC&amp;pg=PA436&amp;dq=%22conjunctive+normal+form%22+(%22(rewrite+OR+rewriting)+(system+OR+engine)%22+OR+%22term+rewriting%22)+-wikipedia&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjojLmWzrjVAhXF6iYKHbmgDPEQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22conjunctive%20normal%20form%22%20(%22(rewrite%20OR%20rewriting)%20(system%20OR%20engine)%22%20OR%20%22term%20rewriting%22)%20-wikipedia&amp;f=false|year=1998|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=978-0-262-13341-8|pages=436–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rules of an example of such a system would be:

:&lt;math&gt;\neg\neg A \to A&lt;/math&gt; ([[double negative elimination]])
:&lt;math&gt;\neg(A \land B) \to \neg A \lor \neg B&lt;/math&gt; ([[De Morgan's laws]])
:&lt;math&gt;\neg(A \lor B)  \to \neg A \land\neg B&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; (A \land B) \lor C \to (A \lor C) \land (B \lor C)&lt;/math&gt; ([[distributivity]])
:&lt;math&gt; A \lor (B \land C) \to (A \lor B) \land (A \lor C),&lt;/math&gt;
where the symbol (&lt;math&gt;\to&lt;/math&gt;) indicates that an expression matching the left hand side of the rule can be rewritten to one formed by the right hand side, and the symbols each denote a subexpression. In such a system, each rule is chosen so that the left side is [[Logical equivalence|equivalent]] to the right side, and consequently when the left side matches a subexpression, performing a rewrite of that subexpression from left to right maintains logical consistency and value of the entire expression.

=== Linguistics ===
In [[linguistics]], '''rewrite rules''', also called [[phrase structure rule]]s, are used in some systems of [[generative grammar]], as a means of generating the grammatically correct sentences of a language. Such a rule typically takes the form A → X, where A is a [[syntactic category]] label, such as [[noun phrase]] or [[sentence (linguistics)|sentence]], and X is a sequence of such labels or [[morpheme]]s, expressing the fact that A can be replaced by X in generating the constituent structure of a sentence. For example, the rule S → NP VP means that a sentence can consist of a noun phrase followed by a [[verb phrase]]; further rules will specify what sub-constituents a noun phrase and a verb phrase can consist of, and so on.

== Abstract rewriting systems ==
{{Main|Abstract rewriting system}}

From the above examples, it is clear that we can think of rewriting systems in an abstract manner. We need to specify a set of objects and the rules that can be applied to transform them. The most general (unidimensional) setting of this notion is called an '''abstract reduction system''', (abbreviated '''ARS'''), although more recently authors use '''abstract rewriting system''' as well.&lt;ref&gt;Bezem et al., p. 7,&lt;/ref&gt; (The preference for the word "reduction" here instead of "rewriting" constitutes a departure from the uniform use of "rewriting" in the names of systems that are particularizations of ARS. Because the word "reduction" does not appear in the names of more specialized systems, in older texts '''reduction system''' is a synonym for ARS).&lt;ref name="Book and Otto, p. 10"&gt;Book and Otto, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

An ARS is simply a set ''A'', whose elements are usually called objects, together with a [[binary relation]] on ''A'', traditionally denoted by →, and called the '''reduction relation''', '''rewrite relation'''&lt;ref&gt;Bezem et al., p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; or just '''reduction'''.&lt;ref name="Book and Otto, p. 10"/&gt; This (entrenched) terminology using "reduction" is a little misleading, because the relation is not necessarily reducing some measure of the objects; this will become more apparent when we discuss string-rewriting systems further in this article.

'''Example 1'''. Suppose the set of objects is ''T'' = {''a'', ''b'', ''c''} and the binary relation is given by the rules ''a'' → ''b'', ''b'' → ''a'', ''a'' → ''c'', and ''b'' → ''c''. Observe that these rules can be applied to both ''a'' and ''b'' in any fashion to get the term ''c''. Such a property is clearly an important one. Note also, that ''c'' is, in a sense, a "simplest" term in the system, since nothing can be applied to ''c'' to transform it any further. This example leads us to define some important notions in the general setting of an ARS. First we need some basic notions and notations.&lt;ref&gt;Baader and Nipkow, pp.&amp;nbsp;8–9&lt;/ref&gt;

* &lt;math&gt;\stackrel{*}{\rightarrow}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[transitive closure]] of &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow \cup =&lt;/math&gt;, where = is the [[identity relation]], i.e. &lt;math&gt;\stackrel{*}{\rightarrow}&lt;/math&gt; is the smallest [[preorder]] ([[reflexive relation|reflexive]] and [[transitive relation|transitive]] relation) containing &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow&lt;/math&gt;. It is also called the [[reflexive transitive closure]] of &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow&lt;/math&gt;.
* &lt;math&gt;\leftrightarrow&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow \cup \ \xrightarrow{-1}&lt;/math&gt;, that is the union of the relation → with its [[converse relation]], also known as the [[symmetric closure]] of &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow&lt;/math&gt;.
* &lt;math&gt;\stackrel{*}{\leftrightarrow}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[transitive closure]] of &lt;math&gt;\leftrightarrow \cup =&lt;/math&gt;, that is &lt;math&gt;\stackrel{*}{\leftrightarrow}&lt;/math&gt; is the smallest [[equivalence relation]] containing &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow&lt;/math&gt;. It is also known as the [[reflexive transitive symmetric closure]] of &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Normal forms, joinability and the word problem ===

An object ''x'' in ''A'' is called '''reducible''' if there exists some other ''y'' in ''A'' such that &lt;math&gt;x \rightarrow y&lt;/math&gt;; otherwise it is called '''irreducible''' or a '''normal form'''. An object ''y'' is called a normal form of ''x'' if &lt;math&gt;x \stackrel{*}{\,\rightarrow\,} y&lt;/math&gt;, and ''y'' is irreducible. If ''x'' has a ''unique'' normal form, then this is usually denoted with &lt;math&gt;x{\downarrow}&lt;/math&gt;. In example 1 above, ''c'' is a normal form, and &lt;math&gt;c = a{\downarrow} = b{\downarrow}&lt;/math&gt;. If every object has at least one normal form, the ARS is called '''normalizing'''.

A related, but weaker notion than the existence of normal forms is that of two objects being '''joinable''': ''x'' and ''y'' are said to be joinable if there exists some ''z'' with the property that &lt;math&gt;x \stackrel{*}{\,\rightarrow\,} z \stackrel{*}{\,\leftarrow\,} y&lt;/math&gt;. From this definition, it is apparent that one may define the joinability relation as &lt;math&gt;\stackrel{*}{\,\rightarrow} \circ \stackrel{*}{\,\leftarrow}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\circ&lt;/math&gt; is the [[composition of relations]]. Joinability is usually denoted, somewhat confusingly, also with &lt;math&gt;\downarrow&lt;/math&gt;, but in this notation the down arrow is a binary relation, i.e. we write &lt;math&gt;x \downarrow y&lt;/math&gt; if ''x'' and ''y'' are joinable.

One of the important problems that may be formulated in an ARS is the '''word problem''': given ''x'' and ''y'', are they equivalent under &lt;math&gt;\stackrel{*}{\,\leftrightarrow\,}&lt;/math&gt;? This is a very general setting for formulating the [[Word problem (mathematics)|word problem for the presentation of an algebraic structure]]. For instance, the [[word problem for groups]] is a particular case of an ARS word problem. Central to an "easy" solution for the word problem is the existence of unique normal forms: in this case if two objects have the same normal form, then they are equivalent under &lt;math&gt;\stackrel{*}{\leftrightarrow}&lt;/math&gt;. The word problem for an ARS is [[undecidable problem|undecidable]] in general.

=== The Church–Rosser property and confluence ===
{{main|Confluence (abstract rewriting)}}
An ARS is said to possess the '''Church–Rosser property''' if &lt;math&gt;x \stackrel{*}{\,\leftrightarrow\,} y&lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt;x \downarrow y&lt;/math&gt;. In words, the Church–Rosser property means that any two equivalent objects are joinable. [[Alonzo Church]] and [[J. Barkley Rosser]] proved in 1936 that [[lambda calculus]] has this property;&lt;ref&gt;Alonzo Church and J. Barkley Rosser. Some properties of conversion. Trans.
AMS, 39:472–482, 1936&lt;/ref&gt; hence the name of the property.&lt;ref&gt;Baader and Nipkow, p.&amp;nbsp;9&lt;/ref&gt; (That lambda calculus has this property is also known as the [[Church–Rosser theorem]].) In an ARS with the Church–Rosser property the word problem may be reduced to the search for a common successor. In a Church–Rosser system, an object has ''at most one'' normal form; that is the normal form of an object is unique if it exists, but it may well not exist.

Several different properties are equivalent to the Church–Rosser property, but may be simpler to check in some particular setting. In particular, ''confluence'' is equivalent to Church–Rosser. &lt;!--seemingly wrong, as the confluence def. quatifies over all objs: The notion of confluence can be defined for individual elements, something that's not possible for Church–Rosser.--&gt; An ARS &lt;math&gt;(A,\rightarrow)&lt;/math&gt; is said:

* '''confluent''' if for all ''w'', ''x'', and ''y'' in ''A'',  &lt;math&gt;x \stackrel{*}{\,\leftarrow\,} w \stackrel{*}{\,\rightarrow\,} y&lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt;x \downarrow y&lt;/math&gt;. Roughly speaking, confluence says that no matter how two paths diverge from a common ancestor (''w''), the paths are joining at ''some'' common successor. This notion may be refined as property of a particular object ''w'', and the system called confluent if all its elements are confluent.
* '''locally confluent''' if for all ''w'', ''x'', and ''y'' in ''A'',  &lt;math&gt;x \leftarrow w \rightarrow y&lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt;x \downarrow y&lt;/math&gt;. This property is sometimes called '''weak confluence'''.

'''Theorem.''' For an ARS the following conditions are equivalent: (i) it has the Church–Rosser property, (ii) it is confluent.&lt;ref&gt;Baader and Nipkow, p.&amp;nbsp;11&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Corollary'''.&lt;ref&gt;Baader and Nipkow, p.&amp;nbsp;12&lt;/ref&gt; In a confluent ARS if &lt;math&gt;x \stackrel{*}{\,\leftrightarrow\,} y&lt;/math&gt; then
* If both ''x'' and ''y'' are normal forms, then {{math|1=''x'' = ''y''}}.
* If ''y'' is a normal form, then &lt;math&gt;x \stackrel{*}{\,\rightarrow\,} y&lt;/math&gt;

Because of these equivalences, a fair bit of variation in definitions is encountered in the literature. For instance, in Bezem ''et al.'' 2003 the Church–Rosser property and confluence are defined to be synonymous and identical to the definition of confluence presented here; Church–Rosser as defined here remains unnamed, but is given as an equivalent property; this departure from other texts is deliberate.&lt;ref&gt;Bezem et al., p.11&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the above corollary, in a confluent ARS one may define a normal form ''y'' of ''x'' as an irreducible ''y'' with the property that &lt;math&gt;x \stackrel{*}{\,\leftrightarrow\,} y&lt;/math&gt;. This definition, found in Book and Otto, is equivalent to common one given here in a confluent system, but it is more inclusive &lt;ref group=note&gt;i.e. it considers more objects as a normal form of ''x'' than our definition&lt;/ref&gt; more in a non-confluent ARS.

Local confluence on the other hand is not equivalent with the other notions of confluence given in this section, but it is strictly weaker than confluence.
The relation &lt;math&gt;a \rightarrow b, \; b \rightarrow a, \; a \rightarrow c,\; b \rightarrow d&lt;/math&gt; is locally confluent, but not confluent, as &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; are equivalent, but not joinable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=M.H.A. Neumann|title=On Theories with a Combinatorial Definition of ''Equivalence''|journal=Annals of Mathematics|volume=42|number=2|pages=223–243|year=1942|doi=10.2307/1968867}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Termination and convergence ===
An abstract rewriting system is said to be '''terminating''' or '''noetherian''' if there is no infinite chain &lt;math&gt;x_0 \rightarrow x_1 \rightarrow x_2 \rightarrow \cdots&lt;/math&gt;. In a terminating ARS, every object has at least one normal form, thus it is normalizing. The converse is not true. In example 1 for instance, there is an infinite rewriting chain, namely &lt;math&gt;a \rightarrow b \rightarrow a \rightarrow b \rightarrow \cdots&lt;/math&gt;, even though the system is normalizing. A confluent and terminating ARS is called '''convergent'''. In a convergent ARS, every object has a unique normal form. &lt;!---hard to understand (what is sufficient for what?): But it is sufficient for the system to be confluent and normalizing for a unique normal to exist for every element, as seen in example 1.--&gt;

'''Theorem''' ([[Newman's Lemma]]): A terminating ARS is confluent if and only if it is locally confluent.

== String rewriting systems ==
{{Main|String rewriting system}}

A '''string rewriting system''' (SRS), also known as '''semi-Thue system''', exploits the [[free monoid]] structure of the [[String (computer science)|strings]] (words) over an [[Alphabet (computer science)|alphabet]] to extend a rewriting relation, &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; to ''all'' strings in the alphabet that contain left- and respectively right-hand sides of some rules as [[substring]]s. Formally a semi-Thue systems is a [[tuple]] &lt;math&gt;(\Sigma, R)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; is a (usually finite) alphabet, and &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is a binary relation between some (fixed) strings in the alphabet, called '''rewrite rules'''. The '''one-step rewriting relation''' relation &lt;math&gt;\xrightarrow[R]{}&lt;/math&gt; induced by &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^*&lt;/math&gt; is defined as: for any strings &lt;math&gt;s, t \in \Sigma^*&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;s \,\xrightarrow[R]{}\, t&lt;/math&gt; if and only if there exist &lt;math&gt;x, y, u, v \in \Sigma^*&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;s = xuy&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;t = xvy&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;u R v&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;\xrightarrow[R]{}&lt;/math&gt; is a relation on &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^*&lt;/math&gt;, the pair &lt;math&gt;(\Sigma^*, \xrightarrow[R]{})&lt;/math&gt; fits the definition of an abstract rewriting system. Obviously &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is subset of &lt;math&gt;\xrightarrow[R]{}&lt;/math&gt;. If the relation &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is [[symmetric relation|symmetric]], then the system is called a '''Thue system'''.

In a SRS, the '''reduction relation''' &lt;math&gt;\xrightarrow[R]{*}&lt;/math&gt; is compatible with the monoid operation, meaning that &lt;math&gt;x \,\xrightarrow[R]{*}\, y&lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt;uxv \,\xrightarrow[R]{*}\, uyv&lt;/math&gt; for all strings &lt;math&gt;x, y, u, v \in \Sigma^*&lt;/math&gt;. Similarly, the reflexive transitive symmetric closure of &lt;math&gt;\xrightarrow[R]{}&lt;/math&gt;, denoted &lt;math&gt;\overset{*}{\underset R \leftrightarrow}&lt;/math&gt;, is a [[Congruence relation|congruence]], meaning it is an [[equivalence relation]] (by definition) and it is also compatible with string concatenation. The relation &lt;math&gt;\overset{*}{\underset R \leftrightarrow}&lt;/math&gt; is called the '''Thue congruence''' generated by &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;. In a Thue system, i.e. if &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is symmetric, the rewrite relation &lt;math&gt;\xrightarrow[R]{*}&lt;/math&gt; coincides with the Thue congruence &lt;math&gt;\overset{*}{\underset R \leftrightarrow}&lt;/math&gt;.

The notion of a semi-Thue system essentially coincides with the [[presentation of a monoid]]. Since &lt;math&gt;\overset{*}{\underset R \leftrightarrow}&lt;/math&gt; is a congruence, we can define the '''factor monoid''' &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}_R = \Sigma^*/\overset{*}{\underset R \leftrightarrow}&lt;/math&gt; of the free monoid &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^*&lt;/math&gt; by the Thue congruence in the [[factor monoid|usual manner]]. If a monoid &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt; is [[isomorphic]] with &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}_R&lt;/math&gt;, then the semi-Thue system &lt;math&gt;(\Sigma, R)&lt;/math&gt; is called a [[monoid presentation]] of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt;.

We immediately get some very useful connections with other areas of algebra. For example, the alphabet {''a'', ''b''} with the rules { ''ab'' → ε, ''ba'' → ε }, where ε is the [[empty string]], is a presentation of the [[free group]] on one generator. If instead the rules are just { ''ab'' → ε }, then we obtain a presentation of the [[bicyclic monoid]]. Thus semi-Thue systems constitute a natural framework for solving the [[word problem (mathematics)|word problem]] for monoids and groups. In fact, every monoid has a presentation of the form &lt;math&gt;(\Sigma, R)&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. it may always be presented by a semi-Thue system, possibly over an infinite alphabet.

The word problem for a semi-Thue system is undecidable in general; this result is sometimes known as the '''Post-Markov theorem'''.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Davis et al. 1994, p.&amp;nbsp;178&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''term rewriting system''' (TRS) is a rewriting system whose objects are ''[[term (logic)|terms]]'', which are expressions with nested sub-expressions. For example, the system shown under ''{{section link||Logic}}'' above is a term rewriting system. The terms in this system are composed of binary operators &lt;math&gt;(\vee)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(\wedge)&lt;/math&gt; and the unary operator &lt;math&gt;(\neg)&lt;/math&gt;. Also present in the rules are ''variables'',
these each represent any possible term (though a single variable always represents the same term throughout a single rule).

In contrast to string rewriting systems, whose objects are sequences of symbols, the objects of a term rewriting system form a [[term algebra]]. A term can be visualized as a tree of symbols, the set of admitted symbols being fixed by a given [[signature (logic)|signature]].

===Formal definition===
A '''term rewriting rule''' is a pair of [[Term (logic)|terms]], commonly written as &lt;math&gt;l \rightarrow r&lt;/math&gt;, to indicate that the left-hand side &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; can be replaced by the right-hand side &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;. A '''term rewriting system''' is a set &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; of such rules. A rule &lt;math&gt;l \rightarrow r&lt;/math&gt; can be '''applied''' to a term &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; if the left term &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; [[Term (logic)#Operations with terms|matches]] some [[Term (logic)#Operations with terms|subterm]] of &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt;, that is, if &lt;math&gt;s|_p = l \sigma&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;here, &lt;math&gt;s \mid_p&lt;/math&gt; denotes the subterm of &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; rooted at position &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;,
while &lt;math&gt;l \sigma&lt;/math&gt; denotes the result of applying the [[substitution (logic)|substitution]] &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; to the term &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
for some [[Term (logic)#Operations with terms|position]] &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; and some [[substitution (logic)|substitution]] &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;. The result term &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; of this rule application is then obtained as &lt;math&gt;t = s[r \sigma]_p&lt;/math&gt;;&lt;ref group=note&gt;here, &lt;math&gt;s[r \sigma]_p&lt;/math&gt; denotes the result of [[Term (logic)#Operations with terms|replacing the subterm]] at position &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; by the term  &lt;math&gt;r \sigma&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
see picture 1. In this case, &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; is said to be '''rewritten in one step''', or '''rewritten directly''', to &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; by the system &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;, formally denoted as &lt;math&gt;s \rightarrow_R t&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; s \,\xrightarrow[R]{}\, t&lt;/math&gt;, or as &lt;math&gt;s \,\xrightarrow{R}\, t&lt;/math&gt; by some authors. 
If a term &lt;math&gt;t_1&lt;/math&gt; can be rewritten in several steps into a term &lt;math&gt;t_n&lt;/math&gt;, that is, if &lt;math&gt;t_1 \,\xrightarrow[R]{}\, t_2 \,\xrightarrow[R]{}\, \ldots \,\xrightarrow[R]{}\, t_n&lt;/math&gt;, the term &lt;math&gt;t_1&lt;/math&gt; is said to be '''rewritten''' to &lt;math&gt;t_n&lt;/math&gt;, formally denoted as &lt;math&gt;t_1 \,\xrightarrow[R]{+}\, t_n&lt;/math&gt;.
In other words, the relation &lt;math&gt;\xrightarrow[R]{+}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[transitive closure]] of the relation &lt;math&gt;\xrightarrow[R]{}&lt;/math&gt;;
often, also the notation &lt;math&gt;\xrightarrow[R]{*}&lt;/math&gt; is used to denote the [[Closure (mathematics)#P closures of binary relations|reflexive-transitive closure]] of &lt;math&gt;\xrightarrow[R]{}&lt;/math&gt;, that is,
&lt;math&gt;s \,\xrightarrow[R]{*}\, t&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;s = t&lt;/math&gt; or {{nobreak|&lt;math&gt;s \,\xrightarrow[R]{+}\, t&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=N. Dershowitz, [[J.-P. Jouannaud]]| title=Rewrite Systems| year=1990| volume=B| pages=243–320| publisher=Elsevier| editor=[[Jan van Leeuwen]]| series=Handbook of Theoretical Computer Science}}; here: Sect.&amp;nbsp;2.3&lt;/ref&gt;}}
A term rewriting given by a set &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; of rules can be viewed as an abstract rewriting system as defined [[#Abstract rewriting systems|above]], with terms as its objects and &lt;math&gt;\xrightarrow[R]{}&lt;/math&gt; as its rewrite relation.

For example, &lt;math&gt;x*(y*z) \rightarrow (x*y)*z&lt;/math&gt; is a rewrite rule, commonly used to establish a normal form with respect to the associativity of &lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt;.
That rule can be applied at the numerator in the term &lt;math&gt;\frac{a*((a+1)*(a+2))}{1*(2*3)}&lt;/math&gt; with the matching substitution &lt;math&gt;\{ x \mapsto a, \; y \mapsto a+1, \; z \mapsto a+2 \}&lt;/math&gt;, see picture 2.&lt;ref group=note&gt;since applying that substitution to the rule's left hand side &lt;math&gt;x*(y*z)&lt;/math&gt; yields the numerator &lt;math&gt;a*((a+1)*(a+2))&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
Applying that substitution to the rule's right hand side yields the term &lt;math&gt;(a*(a+1))*(a+2)&lt;/math&gt;, and replacing the numerator by that term yields &lt;math&gt;\frac{(a*(a+1))*(a+2)}{1*(2*3)}&lt;/math&gt;, which is the result term of applying the rewrite rule.
Altogether, applying the rewrite rule has achieved what is called "applying the associativity law for &lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\frac{a*((a+1)*(a+2))}{1*(2*3)}&lt;/math&gt;" in elementary algebra.
Alternatively, the rule could have been applied to the denominator of the original term, yielding &lt;math&gt;\frac{a*((a+1)*(a+2))}{(1*2)*3}&lt;/math&gt;.

===Termination===
Beyond section [[#Termination and convergence|Termination and convergence]], additional subtleties are to be considered for ''term'' rewriting systems.

Termination even of a system consisting of one rule with a [[Term (logic)#Ground and linear terms|linear]] left-hand side is undecidable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=M. Dauchet| chapter=Simulation of Turing Machines by a Left-Linear Rewrite Rule| title=Proc. 3rd RTA| year=1989|volume=355| pages=109–120| publisher=Springer LNCS|series=LNCS}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Termination is also undecidable for systems using only unary function symbols; however, it is decidable for finite [[Term (logic)#Ground and linear terms|ground]] systems.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite techreport| author=Gerard Huet, D.S. Lankford| title=On the Uniform Halting Problem for Term Rewriting Systems|date=Mar 1978| number=283| pages=8| institution=IRIA| url=http://www.ens-lyon.fr/LIP/REWRITING/TERMINATION/Huet_Lankford.pdf| accessdate=16 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following term rewrite system is normalizing,&lt;ref group=note&gt;i.e. for each term, some normal form exists, e.g. ''h''(''c'',''c'') has the normal forms ''b'' and ''g''(''b''), since ''h''(''c'',''c'') → ''f''(''h''(''c'',''c''),''h''(''c'',''c'')) → ''f''(''h''(''c'',''c''),''f''(''h''(''c'',''c''),''h''(''c'',''c''))) → ''f''(''h''(''c'',''c''),''g''(''h''(''c'',''c'')))  →  ''b'', and ''h''(''c'',''c'') → ''f''(''h''(''c'',''c''),''h''(''c'',''c'')) → ''g''(''h''(''c'',''c''),''h''(''c'',''c'')) → ... → ''g''(''b''); neither ''b'' nor ''g''(''b'') can be rewritten any further, therefore the system is not confluent&lt;/ref&gt; but not terminating,&lt;ref group=note&gt;i.e., there are infinite derivations, e.g. ''h''(''c'',''c'') → ''f''(''h''(''c'',''c''),''h''(''c'',''c'')) → ''f''(''f''(''h''(''c'',''c''),''h''(''c'',''c'')) ,''h''(''c'',''c'')) → ''f''(''f''(''f''(''h''(''c'',''c''),''h''(''c'',''c'')),''h''(''c'',''c'')) ,''h''(''c'',''c'')) → ...&lt;/ref&gt; and not confluent:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Bernhard Gramlich| chapter=Relating Innermost, Weak, Uniform, and Modular Termination of Term Rewriting Systems| title=Proc. [[International Conference on Logic Programming and Automated Reasoning]] (LPAR)|date=Jun 1993| volume=624| pages=285–296| publisher=Springer| editor=Voronkov, Andrei| series=LNAI| chapter-url=http://www.logic.at/staff/gramlich/papers/lpar92.ps.gz}} Here: Example 3.3&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;f(x,x) \rightarrow g(x),&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;f(x,g(x)) \rightarrow b,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;h(c,x) \rightarrow f(h(x,c),h(x,x)).&lt;/math&gt;

The following two examples of terminating term rewrite systems are due to Toyama:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Y. Toyama| title=Counterexamples to Termination for the Direct Sum of Term Rewriting Systems| journal=Inf. Process. Lett.| year=1987|volume=25| issue=3| number=| pages=141–143| url=http://www.nue.riec.tohoku.ac.jp/user/toyama/research/paper/journal/counterexamples.pdf| doi=10.1016/0020-0190(87)90122-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
:&lt;math&gt;f(0,1,x) \rightarrow f(x,x,x)&lt;/math&gt; 
and 
:&lt;math&gt;g(x,y) \rightarrow x,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;g(x,y) \rightarrow y.&lt;/math&gt;
Their union is a non-terminating system, since &lt;math&gt;f(g(0,1),g(0,1),g(0,1)) \rightarrow f(0,g(0,1),g(0,1)) \rightarrow f(0,1,g(0,1)) \rightarrow f(g(0,1),g(0,1),g(0,1)) \rightarrow \ldots&lt;/math&gt;. This result disproves a conjecture of [[Nachum Dershowitz|Dershowitz]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=N. Dershowitz| chapter=Termination| title=Proc. RTA| year=1985| volume=220| pages=180–224| publisher=Springer| editor=[[Jean-Pierre Jouannaud]]| series=LNCS| url=http://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~nachum/papers/LNCS/Termination.pdf}}; here: p.210&lt;/ref&gt; who claimed that the union of two terminating term rewrite systems &lt;math&gt;R_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;R_2&lt;/math&gt; is again terminating if all left-hand sides of &lt;math&gt;R_1&lt;/math&gt; and right-hand sides of &lt;math&gt;R_2&lt;/math&gt; are [[Term (logic)#Ground and linear terms|linear]], and there are no "''overlaps''" between left-hand sides of &lt;math&gt;R_1&lt;/math&gt; and right-hand sides of &lt;math&gt;R_2&lt;/math&gt;. All these properties are satisfied by Toyama's examples.

See [[Rewrite order]] and [[Path ordering (term rewriting)]] for ordering relations used in termination proofs for term rewriting systems.

=== Graph rewriting systems ===

A generalization of term rewrite systems are [[graph rewriting|graph rewrite systems]], operating on [[graph (graph theory)|graphs]] instead of ([[ground term|ground]]-) [[term (mathematics)|terms]] / their corresponding [[tree (graph theory)|tree]] representation.

== Trace rewriting systems ==
[[Trace theory]] provides a means for discussing multiprocessing in more formal terms, such as via the [[trace monoid]] and the [[history monoid]].  Rewriting can be performed in trace systems as well.

== Philosophy ==

Rewriting systems can be seen as programs that infer end-effects from a list of cause-effect relationships.  In this way, rewriting systems can be considered to be automated [[causality]] provers.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

'''Russian Sign Language''' is the [[sign language]] of the [[Deaf]] community in [[Russia]]. It has a grammar unlike the (spoken or written) [[Russian language]], with much stricter word order and word formation rules.  Russian Sign Language belongs to the [[French Sign Language family]].  Vocabulary from [[Austrian Sign Language]] also heavily influences Russian Sign Language.

Russian Sign Language (РЖЯ) has its own grammar and is used by Deaf Russians in everyday communication. However, there is a "[[Manually coded language|signed Russian]]" which is mainly used in official communications, such as sign language lectures at universities, conference papers, and in the past it was used on television in interpreted news programs.

==History==
[[File:«Волк и лиса» на жестовом языке ("The Wolf and the Fox" in sign language).webm|thumb|Russian fairytale "The Wolf and the Fox" in Russian Sign Language.]] RSL is thought to have started ca. 1806, when a school for the deaf was opened at [[Pavlovsk, Saint Petersburg|Pavlovsk]] near St. Petersburg. It was exported to [[Bulgaria]] in 1920, where it has become a separate language ([[Bulgarian Sign Language]]) rather than a dialect of Russian Sign Language, though Russian Sign Language is also used there.

The Moscow Bilingual School for the Deaf, which uses Russian Sign Language in classrooms, was opened in 1992.

Much of the early research on Russian Sign Language was done by Galina Lazarevna Zaitseva, who wrote her 1969 PhD thesis on spatial relationships in Russian Sign Language, and in 1992 devised the now standard term for Russian Sign Language "Russkii Zhestovyi Yazyk" (Russian: Русский Жестовый Язык). Ongoing research into the language takes place at the Centre for Deaf Studies in Moscow.

==Regional variation==
Regional variation of Russian Sign appears to be relatively wide, comparable to the regional variants within [[Polish Sign Language]] or [[Estonian Sign Language]], but greater than a more homogeneous ASL. One study reported lexical similarity between two Russian signers of 70–80%, in the same range as between those two signers and signers from Ukraine and Moldova, but due to the limited sample stopped short of drawing any conclusions as to whether they constituted the same or different languages.&lt;ref&gt;Bickford, 2005. [http://www.sil.org/silesr/2005/silesr2005-026.pdf ''The Signed Languages of Eastern Europe'']&lt;/ref&gt;

== National status and societal attitudes ==

=== State status, related issues ===
{{See also |Legal recognition of sign languages#Sign language status by state{{!}}Legal recognition of sign languages § Sign language status by state}}
Active status of Russian sign language is as follows: 
# The Russian Federation provides services for sign language for rehabilitation measures.
# The current status of Russian Sign Language is extremely low. According to article 14 of the Russian Federal Law, entitled "Social protection of the disabled in the Russian Federation", sign language is recognized as a means of interpersonal communication.  Although it is recognized, there is no state support, despite Articles 3, 5, 14, and 19 of the Russian Federal Law, which claim to provide necessary services to the deaf.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deafnet.ru/new.phtml?c=70&amp;id=7258&amp;page=1 Valentin Lebedev. In search of a common language (Russian)]&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several problems concerning the study and application of sign language in Russia, which Valery Nikitich Rukhledev, President of the [[All-Russian Society of the Deaf]]&lt;ref name="medv"&gt;[http://archive.kremlin.ru/ text/appears/2009/04/214924.shtml verbatim record of the meeting of the Council for the Disabled]&lt;/ref&gt; cited: 
# The instruction of sign language interpreters is an old, long-established program, and they study some gestures, which have long fallen into disuse or have changed in meaning or form. Because of this, interpreters have difficulty understanding the deaf, who try to use their services.
# Until 1990, the sign language interpreter trade unions had 5,500 translators, of whom 1,000 worked in the system of our organization. Now, thanks to the federal target program "Social Support of Disabled," we manage to keep translators at 800. But the shortage of interpreters remains at about 5,000 people.
# Today{{when|date=May 2018}}, the Russian Federation only trains sign language interpreters with the issuance of state diplomas from the inter-regional center for the medical rehabilitation of persons with hearing disabilities center in St. Petersburg. Eliminating the existing deficit of sign language interpreters in a country like Russia is impossible with only one training center. It is necessary to train more specialists and to have them in distant regions of the country.

However, there is hope that the situation can change. On April 4, 2009 at the Russian Council on The Disabled, President Dmitry Medvedev discussed the issue of the status of sign language in Russia. In his closing remarks, the President of the Russian Federation expressed his opinion:&lt;ref name="medv" /&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; "There is indeed, a distinct lack of sign language translators. This level of need necessitates changes. There are considerations and proposals for implementation to resolve the need of training sign language interpreters to provide translation services. But I agree with what has been said: it is necessary to reconsider the preparation of the interpreters at the Ministry of Education Institutions and universities. These teachers should be prepared in virtually every federal district, because we have a huge country and it is impossible to imagine having all sign language interpreters trained in Moscow, for example, and this is the only way we can solve this problem. I am glad that the State Duma supported the initiatives of the President, so we will continue to work in the same unity, in which we have previously worked to resolve this issue." &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Sandilyan was born in [[Tirukoilur|Thirukovilur]], [[Tamil Nadu]] on 10 November 1910&lt;ref name=A&gt;Datta, P.631-2&lt;/ref&gt; to Ramanujam Iyengar and Poongovilvalli. His family was from Thiruindalur village near [[Mayiladuthurai]]. He did his schooling in [[Chennai]] Pachaiyappa's School and [[Saidapet]] Model School. His college education came from [[Tiruchirappalli]] St. Joseph's College. While in college, he was influenced by the visit of [[C. Rajagopalachari]] and joined the [[Indian independence movement]]. He became a member of the [[Indian National Congress]]. He married Ranganayaki in 1929.

==Early career==
After finishing college he moved to [[T. Nagar]] in the 1930s. He became friends with his neighbours [[V.Swaminatha Sharma]] who was working in [[V. Kalyanasundaram|Thiru. Vi. Ka's]] weekly magazine ''Navasakthi'' and the noted Tamil writer [[Kalki Krishnamurthy]]. With their encouragement he wrote his first short story titled ''Shantha Seelan''. Impressed with his work, Kalki published his short stories like ''Kannammavin Kadhal'', ''Adhirshtam'' in [[Ananda Vikatan]]. Encouraged by this success Sandilyan started learning the Tamil language formally from a Tamil Pandit named Thirukannapuram Srinivachariar. He started writing Tamil short stories in the Tamil Weekly ''Sudesamithran'' and also worked as a reporter in ''Sudesamithran'' from 1935 to 1942. Later he became a sub-editor at the English daily newspaper [[Hindustan Times]].

==Work in films==
During his time at the [[Hindustan Times]] he became friends with B N Reddy of [[Vijaya Studios]] and [[Chittor V. Nagaiah]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindu.com/fr/2005/04/08/stories/2005040800220400.htm Nagaiah&amp;nbsp;— noble, humble and kind-hearted]&lt;/ref&gt; This bought him into the world of films. He co-wrote the screenplays of films like [[Swarga Seema]] (1945) and [[En Veedu]] (1953). He later wrote about his film world experiences in his book ''Cinema Valarndha Kadhai'' (1985). Later he also produced a documentary titled "Birth of a Newspaper".

==Novels==
After his stint at the [[Hindustan Times]] he returned to work at ''Sudesamithran'' and started writing full-length novels. One of his first works was a self-published [[political fiction|political novel]] called ''Balathkaaram''. He also started publishing in other magazines like ''Amudhasurabi''. ''Paalaivanathu pushpam'' and ''Sandha deepam'' were his earliest historical novels. Sandilyan's most famous novels were serialised in ''[[Kumudam]]'', a weekly Tamil magazine and was instrumental in increasing the circulation to a greater extent. He was one of the very few Tamil writers to get a monthly salary from ''Kumudam'' for his novels. After leaving ''Kumudam'', he unsuccessfully ran a weekly magazine called ''Kamalam''. His historical novels were published in book form by [[Vanadhi Padhippagam]] and became best sellers. As of 2009, many of them still remain in print, four decades after being first published. [[Kamil Zvelebil]] once called him as the "fourth most popular Tamil Writer".&lt;ref name=A /&gt;

==Nationalization Controversy==
In 2009, The [[Tamil Nadu]] Government announced its intention to nationalise Sandilyan's works (along with those of 28 other authors) and provide compensation to his legal heirs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tn.gov.in/budget/budsp_2009_10_3.htm Tamil Nadu 2009 Budget report]&lt;/ref&gt; This caused criticism from the legal heirs of [[Sundara Ramasami]] and [[Kannadasan]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2009-02-18/chennai/28033187_1_sundara-ramasamy-vaiyapuri-pillai-tamil-writers Literary works of 28 Tamil writers to be nationalised]&lt;/ref&gt; The Government soon retracted its position saying that the offer was optional and that it would force those who did not want to lose royalty.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newindianexpress.com/states/tamil_nadu/article38184.ece U-turn on nationalising works of Kannadasan]&lt;/ref&gt; Sandilyan's legal heirs declined the Government's offer to nationalise and provide solatium.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newindianexpress.com/cities/chennai/article124629.ece Legal heirs of 5 Tamil writers decline offer]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13268">In [[theoretical computer science]] and [[mathematical logic]] a '''string rewriting system''' ('''SRS'''), historically called a '''semi-[[Axel Thue|Thue]] system''', is a [[rewriting]] system over [[String (computer science)|strings]] from a (usually [[Finite set|finite]]) [[Alphabet (computer science)|alphabet]]. Given a [[binary relation]] &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; between fixed strings over the alphabet, called '''rewrite rules''', denoted by &lt;math&gt;s\rightarrow t&lt;/math&gt;, an SRS extends the rewriting relation to all strings in which the left- and right-hand side of the rules appear as [[substring]]s, that is &lt;math&gt;usv\rightarrow utv&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; are strings.

The notion of a semi-Thue system essentially coincides with the [[presentation of a monoid]]. Thus they constitute a natural framework for solving the [[word problem (mathematics)|word problem]] for monoids and groups.

An SRS can be defined directly as an [[abstract rewriting system]]. It can also be seen as a restricted kind of a [[term rewriting]] system. As a formalism, string rewriting systems are [[Turing complete]]. The semi-Thue name comes from the Norwegian mathematician [[Axel Thue]], who introduced systematic treatment of string rewriting systems in a 1914 paper.&lt;ref&gt;Book and Otto, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; Thue introduced this notion hoping to solve the word problem for finitely presented semigroups. It wasn't until 1947 the problem was shown to be [[undecidable problem|undecidable]]&amp;mdash; this result was obtained independently by [[Emil Post]] and [[Andrey Markov (Soviet mathematician)|A. A. Markov Jr.]]&lt;ref&gt;Abramsky et al. p. 416&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Salomaa et al., p.444&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==

A '''string rewriting system''' or '''semi-Thue system''' is a [[tuple]] &lt;math&gt;(\Sigma, R)&lt;/math&gt; where  
* {{math|&amp;Sigma;}} is an alphabet, usually assumed finite.&lt;ref&gt;In Book and Otto a semi-Thue system is defined over a finite alphabet through most of the book, except chapter 7 when monoid presentation are introduced, when this assumption is quietly dropped.&lt;/ref&gt; The elements of the set &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^*&lt;/math&gt; (* is the [[Kleene star]] here) are finite (possibly empty) strings on {{math|&amp;Sigma;}}, sometimes called ''words'' in [[formal languages]]; we will simply call them strings here.
* {{mvar|R}} is a [[binary relation]] on strings from {{math|&amp;Sigma;}}, i.e., &lt;math&gt;R \subseteq \Sigma^* \times \Sigma^*.&lt;/math&gt; Each element &lt;math&gt;(u,v) \in R&lt;/math&gt; is called a ''(rewriting) rule'' and is usually written &lt;math&gt;u \rightarrow v&lt;/math&gt;.  

If the relation {{mvar|R}} is [[symmetric relation|symmetric]], then the system is called a '''Thue system'''.

The rewriting rules in {{mvar|R}} can be naturally extended to other strings in &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^*&lt;/math&gt; by allowing substrings to be rewritten according to {{mvar|R}}. More formally, the '''one-step rewriting relation''' relation &lt;math&gt;\xrightarrow[R]{}&lt;/math&gt; induced by {{mvar|R}} on &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^*&lt;/math&gt; for any strings &lt;math&gt;s, t \in \Sigma^*&lt;/math&gt;:

: &lt;math&gt;s \xrightarrow[R]{} t&lt;/math&gt; if and only if there exist &lt;math&gt;x, y, u, v \in \Sigma^*&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;s = xuy&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;t = xvy&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;u \rightarrow v&lt;/math&gt;.

Since &lt;math&gt;\xrightarrow[R]{}&lt;/math&gt; is a relation on &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^*&lt;/math&gt;, the pair &lt;math&gt;(\Sigma^*, \xrightarrow[R]{})&lt;/math&gt; fits the definition of an [[abstract rewriting system]]. Obviously {{mvar|R}} is a subset of &lt;math&gt;\xrightarrow[R]{}&lt;/math&gt;. Some authors use a different notation for the arrow in &lt;math&gt;\xrightarrow[R]{}&lt;/math&gt; (e.g. &lt;math&gt;\xrightarrow[R]{}&lt;/math&gt;) in order to distinguish it from {{mvar|R}} itself (&lt;math&gt;\rightarrow&lt;/math&gt;) because they later want to be able to drop the subscript and still avoid confusion between {{mvar|R}} and the one-step rewrite induced by {{mvar|R}}.

Clearly in a semi-Thue system we can form a (finite or infinite) sequence of strings produced by starting with an initial string &lt;math&gt;s_0 \in \Sigma^*&lt;/math&gt; and repeatedly rewriting it by making one substring-replacement at a time: 

:&lt;math&gt;s_0 \ \xrightarrow[R]{} \ s_1 \ \xrightarrow[R]{} \ s_2 \ \xrightarrow[R]{} \ \ldots &lt;/math&gt;

A zero-or-more-steps rewriting like this is captured by the [[reflexive transitive closure]] of &lt;math&gt;\xrightarrow[R]{}&lt;/math&gt;, denoted by &lt;math&gt;\xrightarrow[R]{*}&lt;/math&gt; (see [[abstract rewriting system#Basic notions]]). This is called the '''rewriting relation''' or '''reduction relation''' on &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^*&lt;/math&gt; induced by {{mvar|R}}.

== Thue congruence ==

In general, the set &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^*&lt;/math&gt; of strings on an alphabet forms a [[free monoid]] together with the [[binary operation]] of [[string concatenation]] (denoted as &lt;math&gt;\cdot&lt;/math&gt; and written multiplicatively by dropping the symbol). In a SRS, the reduction relation &lt;math&gt;\xrightarrow[R]{*}&lt;/math&gt; is compatible with the monoid operation, meaning that &lt;math&gt;x\xrightarrow[R]{*} y&lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt;uxv\xrightarrow[R]{*} uyv&lt;/math&gt; for all strings &lt;math&gt;x, y, u, v \in \Sigma^*&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;\xrightarrow[R]{*}&lt;/math&gt; is by definition a [[preorder]], &lt;math&gt;\left(\Sigma^*, \cdot, \xrightarrow[R]{*}\right)&lt;/math&gt; forms a [[Monoidal_category#Monoidal_preorders|monoidal preorder]].

Similarly, the [[reflexive transitive symmetric closure]] of &lt;math&gt;\xrightarrow[R]{}&lt;/math&gt;, denoted &lt;math&gt;\overset{*}{\underset R \leftrightarrow}&lt;/math&gt; (see [[abstract rewriting system#Basic notions]]), is a [[Congruence relation|congruence]], meaning it is an [[equivalence relation]] (by definition) and it is also compatible with string concatenation. The relation &lt;math&gt;\overset{*}{\underset R \leftrightarrow}&lt;/math&gt; is called the '''Thue congruence''' generated by {{mvar|R}}. In a Thue system, i.e. if {{mvar|R}} is symmetric, the rewrite relation &lt;math&gt;\xrightarrow[R]{*}&lt;/math&gt; coincides with the Thue congruence &lt;math&gt;\overset{*}{\underset R \leftrightarrow}&lt;/math&gt;.

== Factor monoid and monoid presentations ==
Since &lt;math&gt;\overset{*}{\underset R \leftrightarrow}&lt;/math&gt; is a congruence, we can define the '''factor monoid''' &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}_R = \Sigma^*/\overset{*}{\underset R \leftrightarrow}&lt;/math&gt; of the [[free monoid]] &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^*&lt;/math&gt; by the Thue congruence in the [[factor monoid|usual manner]]. If a monoid &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt; is [[isomorphic]] with &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}_R&lt;/math&gt;, then the semi-Thue system &lt;math&gt;(\Sigma, R)&lt;/math&gt; is called a [[monoid presentation]] of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt;.

We immediately get some very useful connections with other areas of algebra. For example, the alphabet {''a'', ''b''} with the rules { ''ab'' → ε, ''ba'' → ε }, where ε is the [[empty string]], is a presentation of the [[free group]] on one generator. If instead the rules are just { ''ab'' → ε }, then we obtain a presentation of the [[bicyclic monoid]].

The importance of semi-Thue systems as presentation of monoids is made stronger by the following:

'''Theorem''': Every monoid has a presentation of the form &lt;math&gt;(\Sigma, R)&lt;/math&gt;, thus it may be always be presented by a semi-Thue system, possibly over an infinite alphabet.&lt;ref&gt;Book and Otto, Theorem 7.1.7, p. 149&lt;/ref&gt;

In this context, the set &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; is called the '''set of generators''' of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is called the set of '''defining relations''' &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt;. We can immediately classify monoids based on their presentation. &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt; is called
* '''finitely generated''' if &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; is finite.
* '''finitely presented''' if both &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; are finite.

== The word problem for semi-Thue systems ==

The word problem for semi-Thue systems can be stated as follows: Given a semi-Thue system &lt;math&gt;T:=(\Sigma, R)&lt;/math&gt; and two words (strings) &lt;math&gt;u, v \in \Sigma^*&lt;/math&gt;, can &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; be transformed into &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; by applying rules from &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;? This problem is [[Undecidable problem|undecidable]], i.e. there is no general algorithm for solving this problem. This even holds if we limit the input to finite systems{{Definition needed|date=January 2018}}.

Martin Davis offers the lay reader a two-page proof in his article "What is a Computation?" pp.&amp;nbsp;258–259 with commentary p.&amp;nbsp;257. Davis casts the proof in this manner: "Invent [a word problem] whose solution would lead to a solution to the [[halting problem]]."

== Connections with other notions ==

A semi-Thue system is also a [[term-rewriting]] system&amp;mdash;one that has [[monadic (arity)|monadic]] words (functions) ending in the same variable as the left- and right-hand side terms,&lt;ref&gt;[[Nachum Dershowitz]] and [[Jean-Pierre Jouannaud]]. [http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/dershowitz90rewrite.html Rewrite Systems] (1990) p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; e.g. a term rule &lt;math&gt;f_2(f_1(x)) \rightarrow g(x)&lt;/math&gt; is equivalent to the string rule &lt;math&gt;f_1f_2 \rightarrow g&lt;/math&gt;.

A semi-Thue system is also a special type of [[Post canonical system]], but every Post canonical system can also be reduced to an SRS. Both formalisms are [[Turing complete]], and thus equivalent to [[Noam Chomsky]]'s [[unrestricted grammar]]s, which are sometimes called ''semi-Thue grammars''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Daniel I. A. Cohen|D.I.A. Cohen]], Introduction to Computer Theory, 2nd ed., Wiley-India, 2007, {{isbn|81-265-1334-9}}, p.572&lt;/ref&gt; A [[formal grammar]] only differs from a semi-Thue system by the separation of the alphabet into [[terminal symbol|terminal]]s and non-terminals, and the fixation of a starting symbol amongst non-terminals. A minority of authors actually define a semi-Thue system as a triple &lt;math&gt;(\Sigma, A, R)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;A\subseteq\Sigma^*&lt;/math&gt; is called the ''set of axioms''. Under this "generative" definition of semi-Thue system, an unrestricted grammar is just a semi-Thue system with a single axiom in which one partitions the alphabet into terminals and non-terminals, and makes the axiom a nonterminal.&lt;ref&gt;Dan A. Simovici, Richard L. Tenney, ''Theory of formal languages with applications'', World Scientific, 1999 {{isbn|981-02-3729-4}}, chapter 4&lt;/ref&gt; The simple artifice of partitioning the alphabet into terminals and non-terminals is a powerful one; it allows the definition of the [[Chomsky hierarchy]] based on what combination of terminals and non-terminals the rules contain. This was a crucial development in the theory of [[formal languages]].

==History and importance==
Semi-Thue systems were developed as part of a program to add additional constructs to [[logic]], so as to create systems such as [[propositional logic]], that would allow general mathematical theorems to be expressed in a [[formal language]], and then proven and verified in an automatic, mechanical fashion. The hope was that the act of [[theorem proving]] could then be reduced to a set of defined manipulations on a set of strings.  It was subsequently realized that semi-Thue systems are isomorphic to [[unrestricted grammar]]s, which in turn are known to be isomorphic to [[Turing machine]]s. This method of research succeeded and now computers can be used to verify the proofs of mathematic and logical theorems.

At the suggestion of [[Alonzo Church]], [[Emil Post]] in a paper published in 1947, first proved "a certain Problem of Thue" to be unsolvable, what [[Martin Davis]] states as "...the first unsolvability proof for a problem from classical mathematics -- in this case the word problem for semigroups." (Undecidable p.&amp;nbsp;292)

Davis [ibid] asserts that the proof was offered independently by A. A. Markov (C. R. (Doklady) Acad. Sci. U.S.S.R. (n.s.) 55(1947), pp.&amp;nbsp;583–586.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5516">The '''Serfdom Patent''' of 1 November 1781 aimed to abolish aspects of the traditional [[serfdom]] ({{lang-de|Leibeigenschaft}}) system of the [[Habsburg lands]] through the establishment of basic [[civil liberties]] for the serfs.

The [[feudal system]] bound farmers to inherited pieces of land and subjected them to the absolute control of their [[landlord]].  The landlord was obligated to provide protection, in exchange for the serfs' labor and goods. The Serfdom Patent, issued by the [[enlightened absolutist]] Emperor [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor| Joseph II]], diminished the long-established mastery of the landlords; thus allowing the serfs to independently choose marriage partners, pursue career choices, and move between estates.&lt;ref name="Jelavich1987"&gt;

==Historical context==
The [[Holy Roman Empire|Holy Roman Emperor]] Joseph II ruled as co-regent of the Habsburg Monarchy with his mother, [[Maria Theresa]], from 1765 to 1780. The queen's [[July Decree (1770)|July Decree]] of 1770 granted the peasants the right to justice through royal officials rather than their lords' courts. The [[Patent of 1772]] even granted them the right to appeal to the sovereign, and limited the ''robot'' (labour that lords could demand of their serfs) to three days a week and twelve hours a day. The [[October Decree (1773)|October Decree]] of 1773 capped the price of letters of release, which serfs could buy from their lords to gain their freedom.

Following her death in 1780, Joseph II pursued further liberal reforms. His policies included the [[Patent of Toleration|1781 Edict of Toleration]], in which the [[Roman Catholic]] Emperor granted Protestant denominations more equality than in the past. This represented a tremendous change from the Catholic-centered policies of his mother. Joseph was an enlightened absolutist ruler, incorporating reason and [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] ideals into his administration. Emperor Joseph’s enlightened despot contemporaries, [[Catherine the Great]] of [[Russia]] and [[Frederick the Great]] of [[Prussia]], both claimed to detest feudalism yet chose to appease their noble classes by strengthening the serfdom system during their years in power. Author T. K. E. Blemming describes the rulers' compromises, arguing that "in exchange for absolute power at a national level it was necessary to hand over to them [nobles] absolute power on their estates." Joseph refused to give in to the nobles’ demands, which would soon create difficulties in the implementation of his decrees.

==The motivations of Joseph II==
Much of the Habsburg economy was based on [[agriculture]] in the 18th century. The nobles and clerics were traditionally exempt from taxes, and the burden fell mainly on the peasants. After paying dues to the landlord, the serfs were unable to create high tax revenues for Joseph's centralized state. The Emperor recognized that the abolishment of the feudal system would allow peasants to pay higher tax rates to the state.&lt;ref name="Good1984"&gt;{{cite book|author=David F. Good|title=The Economic Rise of the Habsburg Empire, 1750-1914|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cz_zBH4r8YgC&amp;pg=PA33|year=1984|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-05094-5|pages=33–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Joseph’s primary objection to feudalism was economic, but his moral objections also arose from witnessing the “inhumanity of serfdom”. He abolished beatings and hoped to allow serfs to appeal court rulings to the throne following a reorganization of the landlord judicial system.

==Consequences of the Serfdom Patent==
The Patent was enforced differently amongst all of the various Habsburg lands.  The nobility in [[Bohemia]] refused to enact its provisions, while the [[Transylvania]]n nobles simply refused to notify the peasants in their region about this emancipation document. The Hungarian estates claimed that their peasants were not serfs, but “tenants in [[fee simple]], who were fully informed as to their rights and duties by precise contracts” and continued to restrict these “tenants”. In contrast, the peasants of the German-speaking provinces were actually aided by the Patent. The 1781 Serfdom Patent allowed the serfs legal rights in the Habsburg monarchy, but the document did not affect the financial dues and the physical [[corvée]] (unpaid labor) that the serfs legally owed to their landlords.  Joseph II recognized the importance of these further reforms, continually attempting to destroy the economic subjugation through related laws, such as his Tax Decree of 1789. This new law would have finally realized Emperor Joseph II’s ambition to modernize Habsburg society, allowing for the end of corvée and the beginning of lesser tax obligations. Joseph’s latter reforms were withdrawn upon his death, but the personal freedom of serfs remained guaranteed through the first half of the nineteenth century due to the consequences of the 1781 Serfdom Patent.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3167">A '''stipulative definition''' is a type of [[definition]] in which a new or currently-existing term is given a new specific meaning for the purposes of [[Logical argument|argument]] or discussion in a given context. When the term already exists, this definition may, but does not necessarily, contradict the [[dictionary]] ([[lexical definition|lexical]]) definition of the term. Because of this, a stipulative definition cannot be "correct" or "incorrect"; it can only differ from other definitions, but it can be useful for its intended purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://atheism.about.com/od/logicalarguments/a/def_stipulative.htm |title=Stipulative Definitions |last=Cline |first=Austin |work=Atheism.about.com |publisher=[[About.com]] |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120104021753/http://atheism.about.com/od/logicalarguments/a/def_stipulative.htm |archivedate=2012-01-04 |accessdate=2017-01-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ConciseIntro&gt;Hurey, Patrick J. ''A Concise Introduction to Logic'', [[Cengage Learning]], {{ISBN|978-0534089283}}  {{full|date=August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, in the riddle of [[Inductive reasoning|induction]] by [[Nelson Goodman]], "[[Grue and Bleen|grue]]" was ''stipulated'' to be "a property of an object that makes it appear green if observed before some future time ''t'', and blue if observed afterward". "Grue" has no meaning in standard English; therefore, Goodman created the new term and gave it a ''stipulative definition''.

==On stipulative definitions==
Stipulative definitions of existing terms are useful in making theoretical arguments, or stating specific cases. For example:
:Suppose we say that to love someone is to be willing to die for that person.
:Take "human" to mean any member of the species ''Homo sapiens''.
:For the purposes of argument, we will define a "student" to be "a person under 18 enrolled in a local school".

Some of these are also [[precising definition]]s, a subtype of stipulative definition that may not contradict but only extend the [[lexical definition]] of a term. [[Theoretical definition]]s, used extensively in [[science]] and philosophy, are similar in some ways to stipulative definitions (although theoretical definitions are somewhat normative, more like [[persuasive definitions]]).&lt;ref name=ConciseIntro/&gt;

Many holders of controversial and highly charged opinions use stipulative definitions in order to attach the emotional or other [[connotation]]s of a word to the meaning they would like to give it; for example, defining "murder" as "the killing of any living thing for any reason". The other side of such an argument is likely to use a different stipulative definition for the same term: "the unlawful killing of a human being with malice aforethought" or "the premeditated killing of a human being". The lexical definition in such a case is likely to fall somewhere in between.

When a stipulative definition is confused with a lexical definition within an argument there is a risk of [[equivocation]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15548">In [[computer science]], in the area of [[formal language theory]], frequent use is made of a variety of [[string functions]]; however, the notation used is different from that used for [[computer programming]], and some commonly used functions in the theoretical realm are rarely used   when programming. This article defines some of these basic terms.

==Strings and languages==
A string is a finite sequence of characters.
The [[empty string]] is denoted by &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;.
The concatenation of two string &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; is denoted by &lt;math&gt;s \cdot t&lt;/math&gt;, or shorter by &lt;math&gt;s t&lt;/math&gt;.
Concatenating with the empty string makes no difference: &lt;math&gt;s \cdot \varepsilon = s = \varepsilon \cdot s&lt;/math&gt;.
Concatenation of strings is associative: &lt;math&gt;s \cdot (t \cdot u) = (s \cdot t) \cdot u&lt;/math&gt;.

For example, &lt;math&gt;(\langle b \rangle \cdot \langle l \rangle) \cdot (\varepsilon \cdot \langle ah \rangle) = \langle bl \rangle \cdot \langle ah \rangle = \langle blah \rangle&lt;/math&gt;.

A [[language (computer science)|language]] is a finite or infinite set of strings.
Besides the usual set operations like union, intersection etc., concatenation can be applied to languages:
if both &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; are languages, their concatenation &lt;math&gt;S \cdot T&lt;/math&gt; is defined as the set of concatenations of any string from &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; and any string from &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;, formally &lt;math&gt;S \cdot T = \{ s \cdot t \mid s \in S \land t \in T \}&lt;/math&gt;.
Again, the concatenation dot &lt;math&gt;\cdot&lt;/math&gt; is often omitted for brevity.

The language &lt;math&gt;\{\varepsilon\}&lt;/math&gt; consisting of just the empty string is to be distinguished from the empty language &lt;math&gt;\{\}&lt;/math&gt;.
Concatenating any language with the former doesn't make any change: &lt;math&gt;S \cdot \{\varepsilon\} = S = \{\varepsilon\} \cdot S&lt;/math&gt;,
while concatenating with the latter always yields the empty language: &lt;math&gt;S \cdot \{\} = \{\} = \{\} \cdot S&lt;/math&gt;.
Concatenation of languages is associative: &lt;math&gt;S \cdot (T \cdot U) = (S \cdot T) \cdot U&lt;/math&gt;.

For example, abbreviating &lt;math&gt;D = \{ \langle 0 \rangle, \langle 1 \rangle, \langle 2 \rangle, \langle 3 \rangle, \langle 4 \rangle, \langle 5 \rangle, \langle 6 \rangle, \langle 7 \rangle, \langle 8 \rangle, \langle 9 \rangle \}&lt;/math&gt;, the set of all three-digit decimal numbers is obtained as &lt;math&gt;D \cdot D \cdot D&lt;/math&gt;. The set of all decimal numbers of arbitrary length is an example for an infinite language.

==Alphabet of a string==
The '''alphabet of a string''' is the set of all of the characters that occur in a particular string. If ''s'' is a string, its [[alphabet (computer science)|alphabet]] is denoted by

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Alph}(s)&lt;/math&gt;

The '''alphabet of a language''' &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is the set of all characters that occur in any string of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;, formally:
&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Alph}(S) = \bigcup_{s \in S} \operatorname{Alph}(s)&lt;/math&gt;.

For example, the set &lt;math&gt;\{\langle a \rangle,\langle c \rangle,\langle o \rangle\}&lt;/math&gt; is the alphabet of the string &lt;math&gt;\langle cacao \rangle&lt;/math&gt;,
and the [[#Strings_and_languages|above]] &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; is the alphabet of the [[#Strings_and_languages|above]] language &lt;math&gt;D \cdot D \cdot D&lt;/math&gt; as well as of the language of all decimal numbers.

==String substitution==
Let ''L'' be a [[language (computer science)|language]], and let Σ be its alphabet. A '''string substitution''' or simply a '''substitution''' is a mapping ''f'' that maps characters in Σ to languages (possibly in a different alphabet). Thus, for example, given a character ''a'' ∈ Σ, one has ''f''(''a'')=''L''&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt; where ''L''&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt; ⊆ Δ[[Kleene star|&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;]] is some language whose alphabet is Δ. This mapping may be extended to strings as

:''f''(ε)=ε

for the [[empty string]] ε, and

:''f''(''sa'')=''f''(''s'')''f''(''a'')

for string ''s'' ∈ ''L'' and character ''a'' ∈ Σ. String substitutions may be extended to entire languages as &lt;ref&gt;Hopcroft, Ullman (1979), Sect.3.2, p.60&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;f(L)=\bigcup_{s\in L} f(s)&lt;/math&gt;

[[Regular language]]s are closed under string substitution. That is, if each character in the alphabet of a regular language is substituted by another regular language, the result is still a regular language.&lt;ref&gt;Hopcroft, Ullman (1979), Sect.3.2, Theorem 3.4, p.60&lt;/ref&gt;
Similarly, [[context-free language]]s are closed under string substitution.&lt;ref&gt;Hopcroft, Ullman (1979), Sect.6.2, Theorem 6.2, p.131&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Although every regular language is also context-free, the previous theorem is not implied by the current one, since the former yields a shaper result for regular languages.&lt;/ref&gt;

A simple example is the conversion ''f''&lt;sub&gt;uc&lt;/sub&gt;(.) to uppercase, which may be defined e.g. as follows:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! character !! mapped to language !! remark
|-
! ''x'' !! ''f''&lt;sub&gt;uc&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'') !!
|-
| ‹''a''› || { ‹''A''› } || map lowercase char to corresponding uppercase char
|-
| ‹''A''› || { ‹''A''› } || map uppercase char to itself
|-
| ‹''ß''› || { ‹''SS''› } || no uppercase char available, map to two-char string 
|-
| ‹0› || { ε } || map digit to empty string
|-
| ‹!› || { } || forbid punctuation, map to empty language
|-
| ... || || similar for other chars
|}

For the extension of ''f''&lt;sub&gt;uc&lt;/sub&gt; to strings, we have e.g.
* ''f''&lt;sub&gt;uc&lt;/sub&gt;(‹Straße›) = {‹S›} ⋅ {‹T›} ⋅ {‹R›} ⋅ {‹A›} ⋅ {‹SS›} ⋅ {‹E›} = {‹STRASSE›},
* ''f''&lt;sub&gt;uc&lt;/sub&gt;(‹u2›) = {‹U›} ⋅ {ε} = {‹U›}, and
* ''f''&lt;sub&gt;uc&lt;/sub&gt;(‹Go!›) = {‹G›} ⋅ {‹O›} ⋅ {} = {}.
For the extension of ''f''&lt;sub&gt;uc&lt;/sub&gt; to languages, we have e.g.
* ''f''&lt;sub&gt;uc&lt;/sub&gt;({ ‹Straße›, ‹u2›, ‹Go!› }) = { ‹STRASSE› } ∪ { ‹U› } ∪ { } = { ‹STRASSE›, ‹U› }.

==String homomorphism==
A '''string homomorphism''' (often referred to simply as a [[Homomorphism#Homomorphisms and e-free homomorphisms in formal language theory|homomorphism]] in [[formal language theory]]) is a string substitution such that each character is replaced by a single string. That is, &lt;math&gt;f(a)=s&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; is a string, for each character &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref group="note" name="singleton sets"&gt;Strictly formally, a homomorphism yields a language consisting of just one string, i.e. &lt;math&gt;f(a) = {s}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hopcroft, Ullman (1979), Sect.3.2, p.60-61&lt;/ref&gt;

String homomorphisms are [[monoid morphism]]s on the [[free monoid]], preserving the empty string and the [[binary operation]] of [[string concatenation]].  Given a language &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;, the set &lt;math&gt;f(L)&lt;/math&gt; is called the '''homomorphic image''' of &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;. The '''inverse homomorphic image''' of a string &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; is defined as

&lt;math&gt;f^{-1}(s) = \{ w | f(w) = s \}&lt;/math&gt;

while the inverse homomorphic image of a language &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; is defined as

&lt;math&gt;f^{-1}(L) = \{ s | f(s) \in L \}&lt;/math&gt;

In general, &lt;math&gt;f(f^{-1}(L)) \neq L&lt;/math&gt;, while one does have

&lt;math&gt;f(f^{-1}(L)) \subseteq L&lt;/math&gt;

and

&lt;math&gt;L \subseteq f^{-1}(f(L))&lt;/math&gt;

for any language &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;.

The class of regular languages is closed under homomorphisms and inverse homomorphisms.&lt;ref&gt;Hopcroft, Ullman (1979), Sect.3.2, Theorem 3.5, p.61&lt;/ref&gt;  
Similarly, the context-free languages are closed under homomorphisms&lt;ref group="note"&gt;This follows from the [[#String substitution|above-mentioned]] closure under arbitrary substitutions.&lt;/ref&gt; and inverse homomorphisms.&lt;ref&gt;Hopcroft, Ullman (1979), Sect.6.2, Theorem 6.3, p.132&lt;/ref&gt;

A string homomorphism is said to be ε-free (or e-free) if &lt;math&gt;f(a) \neq \varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; for all ''a'' in the alphabet &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt;. Simple single-letter [[substitution cipher]]s are examples of (ε-free) string homomorphisms.

An example string homomorphism ''g''&lt;sub&gt;uc&lt;/sub&gt; can also be obtained by defining similar to the [[#String_substitution|above]] substitution: ''g''&lt;sub&gt;uc&lt;/sub&gt;(‹a›) = ‹A›, ..., ''g''&lt;sub&gt;uc&lt;/sub&gt;(‹0›) = ε, but letting ''g''&lt;sub&gt;uc&lt;/sub&gt; be undefined on punctuation chars. 
&lt;!---omitted, since sloppy notation, anyway, see above---
Besides this restriction of its input domain, ''g''&lt;sub&gt;uc&lt;/sub&gt; differs from ''f''&lt;sub&gt;uc&lt;/sub&gt; by returning strings,&lt;ref group=note name="singleton sets"/&gt; while the latter returned singleton sets of strings.
---&gt;
Examples for inverse homomorphic images are
* ''g''&lt;sub&gt;uc&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;({ ‹SSS› }) = { ‹sss›, ‹sß›, ‹ßs› }, since ''g''&lt;sub&gt;uc&lt;/sub&gt;(‹sss›) = ''g''&lt;sub&gt;uc&lt;/sub&gt;(‹sß›) = ''g''&lt;sub&gt;uc&lt;/sub&gt;(‹ßs›) = ‹SSS›, and 
*''g''&lt;sub&gt;uc&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;({ ‹A›, ‹bb› }) = { ‹a› }, since ''g''&lt;sub&gt;uc&lt;/sub&gt;(‹a›) = ‹A›, while ‹bb› cannot be reached by ''g''&lt;sub&gt;uc&lt;/sub&gt;.
For the latter language, ''g''&lt;sub&gt;uc&lt;/sub&gt;(''g''&lt;sub&gt;uc&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;({ ‹A›, ‹bb› })) = ''g''&lt;sub&gt;uc&lt;/sub&gt;({ ‹a› }) = { ‹A› } ≠ { ‹A›, ‹bb› }.
The homomorphism ''g''&lt;sub&gt;uc&lt;/sub&gt; is not ε-free, since it maps e.g. ‹0› to ε.

A very simple string homomorphism example that maps each character to just a character is the conversion of an [[EBCDIC]]-encoded string to [[ASCII]].

==String projection==
If ''s'' is a string, and &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; is an alphabet, the '''string projection''' of ''s'' is the string that results by removing all characters that are not in &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt;. It is written as &lt;math&gt;\pi_\Sigma(s)\,&lt;/math&gt;.  It is formally defined by removal of characters from the right hand side:

:&lt;math&gt;\pi_\Sigma(s) = \begin{cases} 
\varepsilon &amp; \mbox{if } s=\varepsilon \mbox{ the empty string} \\
\pi_\Sigma(t) &amp; \mbox{if } s=ta \mbox{ and } a \notin \Sigma \\ 
\pi_\Sigma(t)a &amp; \mbox{if } s=ta \mbox{ and } a \in \Sigma   
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

Here &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[empty string]]. The projection of a string is essentially the same as a [[projection in relational algebra]].

String projection may be promoted to the '''projection of a language'''. Given a [[formal language]] ''L'', its projection is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\pi_\Sigma (L)=\{\pi_\Sigma(s)\ \vert\ s\in L \}&lt;/math&gt;{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

==Right quotient==
The '''right quotient''' of a character ''a'' from a string ''s'' is the truncation of the character ''a'' in the string ''s'', from the right hand side. It is denoted as &lt;math&gt;s/a&lt;/math&gt;. If the string does not have ''a'' on the right hand side, the result is the empty string. Thus:
&lt;!---This definition deviates from Hopcroft.Ullman.1979, as remarked below. I guess the former doesn't have widespread use, if it has a source at all.---&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;(sa)/ b = \begin{cases} 
s &amp; \mbox{if } a=b \\
\varepsilon &amp; \mbox{if } a \ne b
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

The quotient of the empty string may be taken:

:&lt;math&gt;\varepsilon / a = \varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;

Similarly, given a subset &lt;math&gt;S\subset M&lt;/math&gt; of a monoid &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;, one may define the quotient subset as

:&lt;math&gt;S/a=\{s\in M\ \vert\ sa\in S\}&lt;/math&gt;

Left quotients may be defined similarly, with operations taking place on the left of a string.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

Hopcroft and Ullman (1979) define the quotient ''L''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/''L''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; of the languages ''L''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''L''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; over the same alphabet as ''L''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/''L''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = { ''s'' | ∃''t''∈''L''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. ''st''∈''L''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; }.&lt;ref&gt;Hopcroft, Ullman (1979), Sect.3.2, p.62&lt;/ref&gt;
This is not a generalization of the above definition, since, for a string ''s'' and distinct characters ''a'', ''b'', Hopcroft's and Ullman's definition implies {''sa''} / {''b''} yielding {}, rather than { ε }.

The left quotient (when defined similar to Hopcroft and Ullman 1979) of a singleton language ''L''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and an arbitrary language ''L''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is known as [[Brzozowski derivative]]; if ''L''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is represented by a [[regular expression]], so can be the left quotient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Janusz A. Brzozowski| authorlink=Janusz Brzozowski (computer scientist)|title=Derivatives of Regular Expressions| journal=J ACM| year=1964| volume=11| pages=481–494| doi=10.1145/321239.321249}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Syntactic relation==
The right quotient of a subset &lt;math&gt;S\subset M&lt;/math&gt; of a monoid &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; defines an [[equivalence relation]], called the '''right [[syntactic relation]]''' of ''S''. It is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\sim_S \;\,=\, \{(s,t)\in M\times M\ \vert\ S/s = S/t \}&lt;/math&gt;

The relation is clearly of finite index (has a finite number of equivalence classes) if and only if the family right quotients is finite; that is, if

:&lt;math&gt;\{S/m\ \vert\ m\in M\}&lt;/math&gt;

is finite. In the case that ''M'' is the monoid of words over some alphabet, ''S'' is then a [[regular language]], that is, a language that can be recognized by a [[finite state automaton]]. This is discussed in greater detail in the article on [[syntactic monoid]]s.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

==Right cancellation==
The '''right cancellation''' of a character ''a'' from a string ''s'' is the removal of the first occurrence of the character ''a'' in the string ''s'', starting from the right hand side. It is denoted as &lt;math&gt;s\div a&lt;/math&gt; and is recursively defined as

:&lt;math&gt;(sa)\div b = \begin{cases} 
s &amp; \mbox{if } a=b \\
(s\div b)a &amp; \mbox{if } a \ne b
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

The empty string is always cancellable:

:&lt;math&gt;\varepsilon \div a = \varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;

Clearly, right cancellation and projection [[Commutative property|commute]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\pi_\Sigma(s)\div a = \pi_\Sigma(s \div a )&lt;/math&gt;{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

==Prefixes==
The '''prefixes of a string''' is the set of all [[prefix (computer science)|prefixes]] to a string, with respect to a given language:

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Pref}_L(s) = \{t\ \vert\ s=tu \mbox { for } t,u\in \operatorname{Alph}(L)^*\}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;s\in L&lt;/math&gt;.

The '''prefix closure of a language''' is

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Pref} (L) = \bigcup_{s\in L} \operatorname{Pref}_L(s) = \left\{ t\ \vert\ s=tu; s\in L; t,u\in \operatorname{Alph}(L)^* \right\}&lt;/math&gt;

'''Example:''' &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;L=\left\{abc\right\}\mbox{ then } \operatorname{Pref}(L)=\left\{\varepsilon, a, ab, abc\right\}&lt;/math&gt;

A language is called '''prefix closed''' if &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Pref} (L) = L&lt;/math&gt;.

The prefix closure operator is [[idempotent]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Pref} (\operatorname{Pref} (L)) =\operatorname{Pref} (L)&lt;/math&gt;

The '''prefix relation''' is a [[binary relation]] &lt;math&gt;\sqsubseteq&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;s\sqsubseteq t &lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;s \in \operatorname{Pref}_L(t)&lt;/math&gt;. This relation is a particular example of a [[prefix order]].{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

In [[library and information science]] [[document]]s (such as books, articles and pictures) are classified and searched by '''subject''' – as well as by other attributes such as author, genre and document type. This makes "subject" a fundamental term in this field. Library and information specialists assign subject labels to documents to make them [[findable]]. There are many ways to do this and in general there is not always consensus about which subject should be assigned to a given document.&lt;ref&gt;This is, for example, measured by so-called inter-indexer consistency studies. See: Saracevic, T. (2008). Effects of inconsistent relevance judgments on information retrieval test results: A historical perspective. Library Trends, 56(4), 763–783. http://comminfo.rutgers.edu/~tefko/LibraryTrends2008.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; To optimize subject indexing and searching, we need to have a deeper understanding of what a subject is. The question: "what is to be understood by the statement 'document A belongs to subject category X'?" has been debated in the field for more than 100 years (see [[#Theoretical views|below]]).

==Definition==

Hjørland defined subjects as the ''epistemological potentials of documents''. This definition is in line with the request oriented understanding of indexing quoted below. The idea is that a document is assigned a subject to ease retrieval and findability. And the criteria for what should be found – what constitutes knowledge – is in the end an epistemological question.&lt;ref&gt;Hjørland, Birger (1992). The Concept of "Subject" in Information Science. Journal of Documentation, 48(2), 172–200. http://www.iva.dk/bh/core%20concepts%20in%20lis/1992JDOC_Subject.PDF&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theoretical views==
===Charles Ammi Cutter (1837–1903)===

For Cutter the stability of subjects depends on a social process in which their meaning is stabilized in a name or a designation. A subject "referred [...] to those intellections [...] that had received a name that itself represented a distinct consensus in usage" (Miksa, 1983a, p.&amp;nbsp;60)&lt;ref&gt;Miksa, F. (1983a): Melvin Dewey and the Corporate Ideal. Pp. 49–100 IN: Melvin Dewey: The Man and the Classification. Ed. by G. Stevenson &amp; J. Kramer-Greene. Albany, NY: Forest Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and: the "systematic structure of established subjects" is "resident in the public realm" (Miksa, 1983a, p.&amp;nbsp;69); "[s]ubjects are by their very nature locations in a classificatory structure of publicly accumulated knowledge (Miksa, 1983a, p. 61). Bernd Frohmann adds: 

"The stability of the public realm in turn relies upon natural and objective mental structures which, with proper education, govern a natural progression from particular to general concepts. 
Since for Cutter, mind, society, and SKO [Systems of Knowledge Organization] stand one behind the other, each supporting each, all manifesting the same structure, his discursive construction of subjects invites connections with discourses of mind, education, and society. The [[Dewey Decimal Classification]] (DDC), by contrast, severs those connections. [[Melvil Dewey]] emphasized more than once that his system maps no structure beyond its own; there is neither a "transcendental deduction" of its categories nor any reference to Cutter's objective structure of social consensus. It is content-free: Dewey disdained any philosophical excogitation of the meaning of his class symbols, leaving the job of finding verbal equivalents to others. His innovation and the essence of the system lay in the notation. The DDC is a poorly semiotic system of expanding nests of ten digits, lacking any referent beyond itself. In it, a subject is wholly constituted in terms of its position in the system. The essential characteristic of a subject is a class symbol which refers only to other symbols. Its verbal equivalent is accidental, a merely pragmatic characteristic...
.... 
The conflict of interpretations over "subjects" became explicit in the battles between "bibliography" (an approach to subjects having much in common with Cutter's) and Dewey's "close classification". William Fletcher spoke for the scholarly bibliographer.... Fletcher's "subjects", like Cutter's, referred to the categories of a fantasized, stable social order, whereas Dewey's subjects were elements of a semiological system of standardized, techno-bureaucratic administrative software for the library in its corporate, rather than high culture, incarnation". (Frohmann, 1994, 112–113).&lt;ref&gt;Frohmann, B. (1994). The Social Construction of Knowledge Organization: The Case of Melvin Dewey. Advances in Knowledge Organization, 4, 109–117.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Cutter's early view on what a subject is, is probably wiser than most understandings that dominated the 20th century – and also the understanding reflected in the ISO-standard quoted below. The early statements quoted by Frohmann indicate that subjects are somehow shaped in social processes. When that is said, it should be added that they are not particularly detailed or clear. We only get a vague idea of the social nature of subjects.

===S. R. Ranganathan (1892–1972)===

A system, which has en explicit theoretical foundation is Ranganathan's [[Colon Classification]]. Ranganathan provided an explicit definition of the concept of "subject":

{{Quote
|Subject – an organized body of ideas, whose extension and intention are likely to fall coherently within the field of interests and comfortably within the intellectual competence and the field of inevitable specialization of a normal person.&lt;ref&gt;Ranganathan, S. R. (1967). Prolegomena to library classification (p. 82). London: Asia Publishing House&lt;/ref&gt;
}}
 
A related definition is given by one of Ranganathan's students: 

{{Quote
|A subject is an organized and systematized body of ideas. It may consist of one idea or a combination of several...&lt;ref&gt;Gopinath, M. A. (1976). Colon Classification. In: A.Maltby (ed.): ''Classification in the 1970s: A second look (rev. ed.; pp. 51–80). London: Clive Bingly.&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

Ranganathan's definition of "subject" is strongly influenced by his Colon Classification system. The colon system is based on the combination of single elements from facets to subject designation. This is the reason why the combined nature of subjects are emphasized so strongly. It  leads, however, to absurdities such as the claim that gold cannot be a subject (but is alternatively termed "an isolate"). This aspect of the theory has been criticized by Metcalfe (1973, p.&amp;nbsp;318).&lt;ref&gt;Metcalfe, J. (1973). When is a Subject not a Subject? IN: Towards a theory of Librarianship. Ed. by Conrad H. Rawski. New York: Scarecrow Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Metcalfe's skepticism regarding Ranganathan's theory is formulated in hard words (op. cit., p.&amp;nbsp;317): "This pseudo-science imposed itself on British disciples from about 1950 on...". 

It seems unacceptable that Ranganathan defines the word subject in a way that favors his own system. A scientific concept like "subject" should make it possible to compare different ways of establishing access to information. Whether or not subjects are combined or not should be examined once their definition has been given, it should not determined a priori, in the definition.

Besides the emphasis on the combined, organizing and systematizing nature of subjects contains Ranganathan's definition of subject the pragmatic demand, that a subject should be determined in a way that suits a normal person's competency or specialization. Again we see a strange kind of wishful thinking mixing a general understanding of a concept with demands put by his own specific system. One thing is what the word subject means, quite another issue is how to provide subject descriptions that fulfill demands such as the specificity of a given information retrieval language which fulfill demands put on the system, such as [[precision and recall]]. If researchers too often define terms in ways that favor specific kinds of systems, that are such definitions not useful to provide more general theories about subjects, subject analysis and IR.  Among other things are comparative studies of different kinds of systems made difficult. 

Based on these arguments (as well as additional arguments which have been used in the literature) we may conclude that Ranganathan's definition of the concept "subject" is not suited for scientific use. Like the definition of "subject" given by the ISO-standard for [[topic maps]] may Ranganathan's definition be useful within his own closed system. The purpose of a scientific and scholarly field is, however, to examine the relative fruitfulness of systems such as [[topic maps]] and Colon classification. For such purpose is another understanding of "subject" necessary.

===Patrick Wilson (1927–2003)===

In his book Wilson (1968)&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Patrick (1968). Two Kinds of Power. An Essay on Bibliographical Control. Berkeley: University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt; examined – in particular by thought experiments – the suitability of different methods of examining the subject of a document. The methods were:

* identifying the author's purpose for writing the document,
* weighing the relative dominance and subordination of different elements in the picture, which the reading imposes on the reader,
* grouping or count the document's use of concepts and references,
* construing a set of rules for selecting elements deemed necessary (as opposed to unnecessary) for the work as a whole.

Patrick Wilson shows convincingly that each of these methods are insufficient to determine the subject of a document and is led to conclude (&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Patrick (1968). Two Kinds of Power. An Essay on Bibliographical Control. Berkeley: University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt; p.&amp;nbsp;89): "The notion of the subject of a writing is indeterminate..." or, on p.&amp;nbsp;92 (about what users may expect to find using a particular position in a library classification system): "For nothing definite can be expected of the things found at any given position". In connection to the last quote has Wilson an interesting footnote in which he writes that authors of documents often use terms in ambiguous  ways ("hostility" is used as an example). Even if the librarian could personally develop a very precise understanding of a concept, he would be unable to use it in his classification, because none of the documents use the term in the same precise way.  Based on this argumentation is Wilson led to conclude: "If people write on what are for them ill-defined phenomena, a correct description of their subjects must reflect the ill-definedness". 

Wilson's concept of subject was discussed by Hjørland (1992) who found that it is problematic to give up the precise understanding of such a basic term in LIS. Wilson's arguments led him to an agnostic position which Hjørland found unacceptable and unnecessary. Concerning the authors' use of ambiguous terms, the role of the subject analysis is to determine which documents would be fruitful for users to identify whether or not the documents use one or another term or whether a given term in a document is used in one or another meaning. Clear and relevant concepts and distinctions in classification systems and controlled vocabularies may be fruitful even if they are applied to documents with ambiguous terminology.

==="Content oriented" versus "Request oriented" views===

Request oriented indexing is indexing in which the anticipated request from users is influencing how documents are being indexed. The indexer ask himself: "Under which descriptors should this entity be found?" and "think of all the possible queries and decide for which ones the entity at hand is relevant" (Soergel, 1985, p.&amp;nbsp;230).&lt;ref&gt;Soergel, Dagobert (1985). Organizing information: Principles of data base and retrieval systems. Orlando, FL: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Request oriented indexing may be indexing that is targeted towards a particular audience or user group. For example, a library or a database for feminist studies may index documents different compared to a historical library.  It is probably better, however, to understand request oriented indexing as policy based indexing: The indexing is done according to some ideals and reflects the purpose of the library or database doing the indexing. In this way it is not necessarily a kind of indexing based on user studies. Only if empirical data about use or users are applied should request oriented indexing be regarded as a user-based approach.

The problem of whether the subject is in the content of a document (objectively) or in the mind of the individual users (subjectively) or in a community (intersubjectively, as a social construction) is a part of the philosophical [[subject–object problem]].

===The subject knowledge view===

Rowley &amp; Hartley (2008, p.&amp;nbsp;109)&lt;ref&gt;Rowley, Jennifer &amp; Hartley, Richard (2008). Organizing knowledge. An Introduction to Managing Access to Information. 4th edition. Aldershot: Ashgate Publishing Limited.&lt;/ref&gt; wrote "In order to achieve good consistent indexing, the indexer must have a through appreciation of the structure of the subject and the nature of the contribution that the document is making to the advancement of knowledge within a particular discipline". This is accordance with Hjørland's definition given above.

===Other views and definitions===

In the ISO-standard for [[topic maps]] the concept of subject is defined this way: 

"Subject
Anything whatsoever, regardless of whether it exists or has any other specific characteristics, about which anything whatsoever may be asserted by any means whatsoever." ISO 13250-1, here cited from draft: http://www1.y12.doe.gov/capabilities/sgml/sc34/document/0446.htm#overview)

This definition may work well with the closed system of concepts provided by the topic maps standard. In broader contexts, however, is not fruitful because it does not contain any specification of what to identify in a document or in a discourse when ascribing subject identification terms or symbols to it. If different methods of subject analysis imply different results, which of these results can then be said to reflect the (true) subject? (Given that the expression "a true subject assignment" is meaningful at all, which is an important part of the problem). Different persons may have different opinions about what the subject of a specific document is. How can a theoretical understanding of the term "subject" be helpful deciding principles of subject analysis?

==Related concepts==
===Indexing words versus concepts versus subjects===

A proposal for the differentiation between concept indexing and subject indexing was given by Bernier (1980).&lt;ref&gt;Bernier, C.L. (1980). Subject Indexes. In: Kent, A.; Lancour, H. &amp; Daily, J.E. (eds.), Encyclopedia of Library and Information Science: Volume 29. New York, NY: Marcel Dekker, Inc.: 191–205.&lt;/ref&gt; In his opinion subject indexes are different from, and can be contrasted with, indexes to concepts, topics and words. Subjects are what authors are working and reporting on. A document can have the subject of Chromatography if this is what the author wishes to inform about. Papers using Chromatography as a
research method or discussing it in a subsection do not have Chromatography as subjects. Indexers can easily drift into indexing concepts and words rather than subjects, but this is not good indexing. Bernier does not, however, differentiate author's subjects from those of the information seeker. A user may want a document about a subject, which is different from the one intended by its author. From the point of view of information systems, the subject of a document is related to the questions that the document can answer for the users (cf. the  distinction between a content oriented and a request-oriented approach). 

Hjørland &amp; Nicolaisen (2005)&lt;ref&gt;Hjørland, Birger &amp; Nicolaisen, Jeppe (2005). Bradford's Law of Scattering: Ambiguities in the Concept of "Subject". In Proceedings of the 5th International Conference on Conceptions of Library and Information Science: 96–106.&lt;/ref&gt; investigated the concept of subject in relation to [[Bradford's law]] of scattering and made a distinction between three kinds of scattering:
* lexical scattering – the scattering of words in texts and in collections of texts,
* semantic scattering – the scattering of concepts in texts and in collections of texts,
* subject scattering – the scattering of items useful to a given task or problem.

===Isness===

"The FRSAR Working Group is aware that some controlled vocabularies provide terminology to express other aspects of works in addition to subject (such as form, genre, and target audience of resources). While very important and the focus of many user queries, these aspects describe isness or what class the work belongs to based on form or genre (e.g., novel, play, poem, essay, biography, symphony, concerto, sonata, map, drawing, painting, photograph, etc.) rather than what the work is about." (IFLA, 2010, p.&amp;nbsp;10).

===Ofness===

"Those LIS authors who have focused on the subjects of visual resources, such as artworks and photographs, have often been concerned with how to distinguish between the "aboutness" and the "ofness" (both specific and generic depiction or representation) of such works (Shatford, 1986). In this sense, "aboutness" has a narrower meaning than that used above. A painting of a sunset over San Francisco, for instance, might be analyzed as being (generically) "of" sunsets and (specifically) "of" San Francisco, but also "about" the passage of time." (IFLA, 2010, p.&amp;nbsp;11).

[[File:World Water Footprint.png|thumb|550px]]
The '''water footprint''' shows the extent of water use in relation to [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]] by people.&lt;ref name="nations"&gt;{{cite web|title=Water footprints of nations: Water use by people as a function of their consumption pattern|url=http://waterfootprint.org/media/downloads/Hoekstra_and_Chapagain_2007.pdf|publisher=Water Footprint Network|access-date= 3 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The water footprint of an individual, community or business is defined as the total volume of [[fresh water]] used to produce the goods and services consumed by the individual or community or produced by the business. Water use is measured in water volume consumed (evaporated) and/or polluted per unit of time. A water footprint can be [[Calculation|calculated]] for any well-defined group of [[consumer]]s (e.g., an individual, family, village, city, province, state or nation) or [[Production (economics)|producers]] (e.g., a public organization, private enterprise or economic sector), for a single [[process]] (such as growing rice) or for any [[Product (business)|product]] or [[Service (economics)|service]].&lt;ref name=waterfootprintorg&gt;{{cite web|title=Waterfootprint.org: Water footprint and virtual water|url=http://www.waterfootprint.org/?page=files/home|publisher=The Water Footprint Network|access-date=9 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, water use has been approached from the production side, by quantifying the following three columns of water use: water withdrawals in the [[Home|domestic]], [[Agriculture|agricultural]] and [[Manufacturing|industrial]] sector. While this does provide valuable data, it is a limited way of looking at water use in a [[Globalization|globalised]] world, in which products are not always consumed in their country of origin. International trade of agricultural and industrial products in effect creates a global flow of [[virtual water]], or ''embodied water'' (akin to the concept of [[embodied energy]]).&lt;ref name="nations" /&gt; 

In 2002, the water footprint concept was introduced in order to have a consumption-based [[Economic indicator|indicator]] of water use, that could provide useful information in addition to the traditional production-sector-based indicators of water use. It is analogous to the [[ecological footprint]] concept introduced in the 1990s. The water footprint is a geographically explicit indicator, not only showing volumes of water use and pollution, but also the locations.&lt;ref&gt;Definition taken from the Hoekstra, A.Y. and Chapagain, A.K. (2008) Globalization of water: Sharing the planet's freshwater resources, Blackwell Publishing, Oxford, UK.[http://www.blackwellpublishing.com/book.asp?ref=9781405163354&amp;site=1]&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, it gives a grasp on how economic choices and processes influence the availability of adequate water resources and other ecological realities across the globe (and vice versa).

Water use.  http://www.fao.org/nr/water/aquastat/water_use/index.stm#tables&lt;/ref&gt;  The remainder,  which goes to [[groundwater]] replenishment and [[surface runoff]], is sometimes called “total actual renewable freshwater resources”.  Its magnitude was in 2012 estimated at {{convert|52,579|km3|abbr=on}}/year.&lt;ref name=Frenken2012&gt;Frenken, K. and V. Gillet.  2012.

AQUASTAT, FAO.&lt;/ref&gt;  It represents water that can be used either in-stream or after withdrawal from surface and groundwater sources.  Of this remainder, about {{convert|3,918|km3|abbr=on}} were withdrawn in 2007, of which {{convert|2,722|km3|abbr=on}}, or 69 percent, were used by agriculture, and {{convert|734|km3|abbr=on}}, or 19 percent, by other industry.&lt;ref&gt;FAO.  2014.  Water withdrawal by sector, around 2007.  http://www.fao.org/nr/water/aquastat/tables/WorldData-Withdrawal_eng.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  Most agricultural use of withdrawn water is for [[irrigation]], which uses about 5.1 percent of total actual renewable [[freshwater]] resources.&lt;ref name=Frenken2012/&gt;  World water use has been growing rapidly in the last hundred years (see [https://www.newscientist.com/data/images/archive/2670/26700101.jpg graph] from ''[[New Scientist]]'' article&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/channel/earth/mg19926700.100-looming-water-crisis-simply-a-management-problem.html "Looming water crisis simply a management problem"] by Jonathan Chenoweth, [[New Scientist]] 28 Aug., 2008, pp. 28-32.&lt;/ref&gt;).

==Definition and measures==

===Blue water footprint===
The ''blue water footprint'' is the volume of water that has been sourced from [[Surface water|surface]] or [[groundwater]] resources (lakes, rivers, wetlands and aquifers) and has either evaporated (for example while [[irrigation|irrigating]] crops), incorporated into a product or taken from one body of water and returned to another, or returned at a different time. Irrigated agriculture, industry and domestic water use can each have a blue water footprint.&lt;ref name=whatis&gt;{{cite web|title=What is a water footprint?|url=http://waterfootprint.org/en/water-footprint/what-is-water-footprint/|publisher=The Water Footprint Network|access-date=8 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Green water footprint===
The ''green water footprint'' is the amount of water from [[precipitation]] that, after having been stored in the root zone of the soil (green water), is either lost by [[evapotranspiration]] or incorporated by plants. It is particularly relevant for agricultural, [[Horticulture|horticultural]] and [[forestry]] products.&lt;ref name=whatis /&gt;

===Grey water footprint===
The ''grey water footprint'' is the volume of water that is required to dilute [[Water pollution|pollutants]] (industrial discharges, seepage from tailing ponds at mining operations, untreated municipal wastewater, or [[nonpoint source pollution]] such as agricultural runoff or [[urban runoff]]) to such an extent that the quality of the water meets agreed water quality standards.&lt;ref name=whatis /&gt; It is calculated as:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{L}{c_\text{max} - c_\text{nat}}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''L'' is the pollutant load (as [[mass flux]]), ''c''&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; the maximum allowable concentration and ''c''&lt;sub&gt;nat&lt;/sub&gt; the natural concentration of the pollutant in the receiving water body (both expressed in mass/volume).&lt;ref name="TheWaterFootprintAssessmentManual"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Water Footprint Assessment Manual|url=http://www.waterfootprint.org/?page=files/WaterFootprintAssessmentManual|publisher=Water Footprint Network|access-date=2015-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Calculation for different actors===
The water footprint of a process is expressed as [[volumetric flow rate]] of water. That of a product is the whole footprint (sum) of processes in its complete supply chain divided by the number of product units. For consumers, businesses and geographic area, water footprint is indicated as volume of water per time, in particular:&lt;ref name="TheWaterFootprintAssessmentManual" /&gt;
* That of a consumer is the sum of footprint of all consumed products.
* That of a community or a nation is the sum for all of its members resp. inhabitants.
* That of a business is the footprint of all produced goods.
* That of a geographically delineated area is the footprint of all processes undertaken in this area. The virtual water balance of an area is the net import of virtual water ''V&lt;sub&gt;i, net&lt;/sub&gt;'', defined as the difference of the gross import ''V&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' of virtual water from its gross export ''V&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;''. The water footprint of national consumption ''WF&lt;sub&gt;area,nat&lt;/sub&gt;'' results from this as the sum of the water footprint of national area and its virtual water balance.

==History==
The concept of a ''water footprint'' was coined in 2002, by Arjen Hoekstra, Professor in [[water management]] at the [[University of Twente]], Netherlands, and co-founder and scientific director of the Water Footprint Network, whilst working at the [[UNESCO-IHE]] Institute for Water Education, as a [[System of measurement|metric]] to measure the amount of water consumed and polluted to produce goods and services along their full supply chain.&lt;ref name=aims&gt;{{cite web|url=http://waterfootprint.org/en/about-us/aims-history/ |title=Water Footprint Network - Aims &amp; history |publisher=Water Footprint Network |date=|access-date= 27 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jayne M. Godfrey, Keryn Chalmers. 2012 Water Accounting: International Approaches to Policy and Decision-making. Edward Elgar Publishing. page222&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hoekstra, A.Y. (2003) (ed) Virtual water trade: Proceedings of the International Expert Meeting on Virtual Water Trade, IHE Delft, the Netherlands [http://www.waterfootprint.org/Reports/Report12.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;  Water footprint is one of a family of [[ecological footprint]] indicators, which also includes [[carbon footprint]] and [[land footprint]]. The water footprint concept is further related to the idea of [[virtual water]] trade introduced in the early 1990's by Professor [[John Anthony Allan|John Allan]] (2008 [[Stockholm Water Prize|Stockholm Water Prize Laureate]]). The most elaborate publications on how to estimate water footprints are a 2004 report on the ''Water footprint of nations'' from [[UNESCO-IHE]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.waterfootprint.org/Reports/Report16Vol1.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; the 2008 book ''Globalization of Water'',&lt;ref&gt;''Globalization of Water'', A.Y. Hoekstra and A.K. Chapagain, Blackwell, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; and the 2011 manual ''The water footprint assessment manual: Setting the global standard''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hoekstra|first=Arjen|title=The water footprint assessment manual: Setting the global standard|year=2011|publisher=Earthscan|location=London|isbn=978-1-84971-279-8|url=http://www.waterfootprint.org/downloads/TheWaterFootprintAssessmentManual.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cooperation between global leading institutions in the field has led to the establishment of the Water Footprint Network in 2008.

===Water Footprint Network (WFN)===
&lt;!-- linked from redirect [[Water Footprint Network]] --&gt;
The Water Footprint Network is an international learning community ([[Nonprofit organization|non-profit foundation]] under Dutch law) that serves as a platform for sharing knowledge, tools and innovations among governments, businesses and communities that are concerned about growing [[water scarcity]] and increasing [[water pollution]] levels and their impacts on people and nature. The network consists of around 100 partners from all sectors – producers, investors, suppliers and regulators – as well as [[non-governmental organisation]]s and [[Academy|academia]]. It describes its mission as follows: &lt;blockquote&gt; To provide [[Evidence-based practice|science-based]], practical solutions and strategic insights that empower companies, governments, individuals and small-scale producers to transform the way we use and share fresh water within earth’s limits.&lt;ref name=aims /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===International standard===
In February 2011, the Water Footprint Network, in a global collaborative effort of environmental organizations, companies, research institutions and the UN, launched the ''Global Water Footprint Standard''. In July 2014, the [[International Organization for Standardization]] issued ''ISO 14046:2014, Environmental management—Water footprint—Principles, requirements and guidelines'', to provide practical guidance to practitioners from various backgrounds, such as large companies, public authorities, non-governmental organizations, academic and research groups as well as small and medium enterprises, for carrying out a water footprint assessment. The ISO standard is based on [[life-cycle assessment]] (LCA) principles and can be applied for different sorts of assessment of products and companies.&lt;ref name=ISO14046&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail?csnumber=43263 |title='''ISO 14046:2014''' Environmental management -- Water footprint -- Principles, requirements and guidelines |publisher=International Organization for Standardization |date=|access-date= 4 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Life-cycle assessment of water use===
[[Life-cycle assessment]] (LCA) is a systematic, phased approach to assessing the environmental aspects and potential impacts that are associated with a product, process or service.  “Life cycle” refers to the major activities connected with the product’s life-span, from its manufacture, use, and maintenance, to its final disposal, and also including the acquisition of [[raw material]] required to manufacture the product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Scientific Applications International Corporations (SAIC)|title=Life Cycle Assessment: Principles and Practice|year=2006|publisher=SAIC|location=Reston, VA}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus a method for assessing the environmental impacts of freshwater consumption was developed.  It specifically looks at the damage to three areas of protection: human health, ecosystem quality, and resources.  The consideration of water consumption is crucial where water-intensive products (for example agricultural goods) are concerned that need to therefore undergo a life-cycle assessment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pfister|first=Stephan|author2=Koehler, Annette |author3=Hellweg, Stefanie |title=Assessing the Environmental Impacts of Freshwater Consumption in LCA|journal=Environmental Science|date=20 March 2009|volume=43|pages=4008–104}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, regional assessments are equally as necessary as the impact of water use depends on its location.  In short, LCA is important as it identifies the impact of water use in certain products, consumers, companies, nations, etc. which can help reduce the amount of water used.

==Water footprint of products==
The water footprint of a product is the total volume of freshwater used to produce the product, summed over the various steps of the production chain. The water footprint of a product refers not only to the total volume of water used; it also refers to where and when the water is used.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.waterfootprint.org/?page=files/Glossary WFN Glossary]&lt;/ref&gt; The Water Footprint Network maintains a global database on the water footprint of products: WaterStat.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.waterfootprint.org/?page=files/WaterStat WaterStat]&lt;/ref&gt;

The water footprints involved in various diets vary greatly, and much of the variation tends to be associated with levels of meat consumption.&lt;ref&gt;Vanham, D., M. M.Mekonnen and A. Y. Hoekstra.  2013.  The water footprint of the EU for different diets.  Ecological Indicators 32: 1-8.&lt;/ref&gt; The following table gives some examples of estimated global average water footprints of some agricultural products.&lt;ref name=Mekonnen2010a&gt;Mekonnen, M.

==Water footprint of companies==
The water footprint of a business, the 'corporate water footprint', is defined as the total volume of freshwater that is used directly or indirectly to run and support a business. It is the total volume of water use to be associated with the use of the business outputs. The water footprint of a business consists of water used for producing/manufacturing or for supporting activities and the indirect water use in the producer’s supply chain.

[[The Carbon Trust]] argue that a more robust approach is for businesses to go beyond simple volumetric measurement to assess the full range of water impact from all sites.  Its work with leading global pharmaceutical company [[GlaxoSmithKline]] (GSK) analysed four key categories: water availability, water quality, health impacts, and licence to operate (including reputational and regulatory risks) in order to enable GSK to quantitatively measure, and credibly reduce, its year-on-year water impact.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.carbontrust.com/news/2014/11/water-water-everywhere-business-water-consumption "Water, water everywhere... or is it?"], ''[[The Carbon Trust]]'', 26 November 2014. Retrieved on 20 January 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Coca-Cola Company]] operates over a thousand manufacturing plants in about 200 countries. Making its drink uses a lot of water. Critics say its water footprint has been large. Coca-Cola has started to look at its [[water sustainability]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2013 Water Report: The Coca-Cola Company|url=http://www.coca-colacompany.com/2013-water-stewardship-replenish-report/|publisher=The Coca-Cola Company|accessdate=8 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It has now set out goals to reduce its water footprint such as treating the water it uses so it goes back into the environment in a clean state. Another goal is to find sustainable sources for the raw materials it uses in its drinks, such as [[sugarcane]], [[oranges]], and [[corn]]. By making its water footprint better, the company can reduce costs, improve the environment, and benefit the communities in which it operates.&lt;ref name=naumann /&gt;

==Water footprint of individual consumers==
The water footprint of an individual refers to the sum of their direct and indirect freshwater use. The direct water use is the water used at home, while the indirect water use relates to the total volume of freshwater that is used to produce the goods and services consumed.

The average global water footprint of an individual is 1,385 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; per year. Residents of some example nations have water footprints as shown in the table:

==Water footprint of nations==
[[File:Water Footprint per capita.jpg|thumb|400px|Global view of national per capita water footprints]]
The water footprint of a nation is the amount of water used to produce the goods and services consumed by the inhabitants of that nation. Analysis of the water footprint of nations illustrates the global dimension of water consumption and pollution, by showing that several countries rely heavily on foreign water resources and that (consumption patterns in) many countries significantly and in various ways impact how, and how much, water is being consumed and polluted elsewhere on Earth. International water dependencies are substantial and are likely to increase with continued global [[Free trade|trade liberalisation]]. The largest share (76%) of the virtual water flows between countries is related to international trade in crops and derived crop products. Trade in animal products and industrial products contributed 12% each to the global virtual water flows. The four major direct factors determining the water footprint of a country are: volume of consumption (related to the [[gross national income]]); consumption pattern (e.g. high versus low [[List of countries by meat consumption|meat consumption]]); climate (growth conditions); and agricultural practice (water use efficiency).&lt;ref name="nations" /&gt;

===Production or consumption===
The assessment of total water use in connection to consumption can be approached from both ends of the [[supply chain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://waterfootprint.org/en/water-footprint/national-water-footprint/|title=National water footprint|author=|date=|website=waterfootprint.org|access-date=10 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The water footprint of '''production''' estimates how much water from local sources is used or polluted in order to provide the goods and services produced in that country. The water footprint of '''consumption''' of a country looks at the amount of water used or polluted (locally, or in the case of imported goods, in other countries) in connection with all the goods and services that are consumed by the inhabitants of that country. The water footprint of production and that of consumption, can also be estimated for any administrative unit such as a city, province, river basin or the entire world.&lt;ref name="nations" /&gt;

===Absolute or per capita===
The absolute water footprint is the total sum of water footprints of all people. A country's [[per capita]] water footprint (that nation's water footprint divided by its number of inhabitants) can be used to compare its water footprint with those of other nations.

The global water footprint in the period 1996–2005 was 9.087 Gm3/yr (Billion Cubic Metres per year, or 9.087.000.000.000.000 liters/year), of which 74% was and green, 11% blue, 15% grey. This is an average amount per capita of 1.385 Gm3/yr., or 3.800 liters per person per day.&lt;ref name=Morelli&gt;{{cite web|title=Angela Morelli - The Global Water Footprint of Humanity|publisher=TEDxOslo|access-date=10 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On average 92% of this is embedded in agricultural products consumed, 4.4% in industrial products consumed, and 3.6% is domestic water use. The global water footprint related to producing goods for export is 1.762 Gm3∕y.&lt;ref name="humanity"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hoekstra |first1=Arjen Y. |last2=Mekonnen |first2=Mesfin M. |date=28 February 2012 |title=The water footprint of humanity |url=http://waterfootprint.org/en/resources/waterstat/national-water-footprint-statistics/ |journal=[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|PNAS]] |volume=109 |issue=09 |pages= |doi= |access-date=9 March 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In absolute terms, India is the country with the largest water footprint in the world, a total of 987 Gm3/yr. In relative terms (i.e. taking population size into account), the people of the USA have the largest water footprint, with 2480 m3/yr per capita, followed by the people in south European countries such as Greece, Italy and Spain (2300–2400 m3/yr per capita). High water footprints can also be found in Malaysia and Thailand. In contrast, the Chinese people have a relatively low per capita water footprint with an average of 700 m3/yr.&lt;ref name="nations" /&gt; (These numbers are also from the period 1996-2005)

===Internal or external===
[[File:GlobalWaterFootprint by sector.1500.jpg|thumb|560px|Global average numbers and composition of all national water footprints, internal and external]]
The '''internal water footprint''' is the amount of water used from domestic water resources; the '''external water footprint''' is the amount of water used in other countries to produce goods and services imported and consumed by the inhabitants of the country. When assessing the water footprint of a nation, it is crucial to take into account the international flows of [[virtual water]] (also called ''embodied water'', i.e. the water used or polluted in connection to all agricultural and industrial commodities) leaving and entering the country. When taking the use of domestic water resources as a starting point for calculating a nation’s water footprint, one should subtract the virtual water flows that leave the country and add the virtual water flows that enter the country.&lt;ref name="nations" /&gt;

The external part of a nation's water footprint varies strongly from country to country. Some African nations, such as Sudan, Mali, Nigeria, Ethiopia, Malawi and Chad have hardly any external water footprint, simply because they have little import. Some European countries on the other hand, e.g. Italy, Germany, the UK and the Netherlands have external water footprints that constitute 50–80% of their total water footprint. The agricultural products that on average contribute most to the external water footprints of nations are: bovine meat, soybean, wheat, cocoa, rice, cotton and maize.
&lt;ref name="nations" /&gt;

The top 10 gross virtual water exporting nations, which together account for more than half of the global virtual water export, are the United States (314 Gm3∕year), China (143 Gm3∕year), India (125 Gm3∕year), Brazil (112 Gm3∕year), Argentina (98 Gm3∕year), Canada (91 Gm3∕year), Australia (89 Gm3∕year), Indonesia (72 Gm3∕year), France (65 Gm3∕year), and Germany (64 Gm3∕year).&lt;ref name="humanity" /&gt;

The top 10 gross virtual water importing nations are the United States (234 Gm3∕year), Japan (127 Gm3∕year), Germany (125 Gm3∕year), China (121 Gm3∕year), Italy (101 Gm3∕year), Mexico (92 Gm3∕year), France (78 Gm3∕year), the United Kingdom (77 Gm3∕year), and The Netherlands (71 Gm3∕year).&lt;ref name="humanity" /&gt;

== Europe ==
{{See also |:Category:Droughts in Europe}}
Each [[Demographics of the European Union|EU citizen]] consumes 4,815 litres of water per day on average; 44% is used in power production primarily to cool thermal plants or [[Nuclear power in the European Union|nuclear power]] plants. Energy production annual water consumption in the EU 27 in 2011 was, in billion m³: for gas 0.53, coal 1.54 and nuclear 2.44. [[Wind energy]] avoided the use of 387 million cubic metres (mn m³) of water in 2012, avoiding a cost of €743 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ewea.org/fileadmin/files/library/publications/reports/Saving_water_with_wind_energy.pdf  Saving water with wind energy], EWEA June 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ewea.org/publications/reports/saving-water-with-wind-energy/|title=Saving water with wind energy Summary EWEA|author=|date=|website=EWEA.org|access-date=5 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Environmental water use==
Although agriculture’s water use includes provision of important terrestrial environmental values (as discussed in the “Water footprint of products” section above), and much “green water’ is used in maintaining forests and wild lands, there is also direct environmental use (e.g. of surface water) that may be allocated by governments. For example, in [[California]], where water use issues are sometimes severe because of drought, about 48 percent of “dedicated water use” in an average water year is for the environment (somewhat more than for agriculture).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.water.ca.gov/swp/watersupply.cfm|title=California State Water Project-Water Supply|author=|date=|website=www.Water.ca.gov|access-date=5 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such environmental water use is for keeping streams flowing, maintaining aquatic and riparian habitats, keeping wetlands wet, etc.

==Criticism of water footprint and virtual water==

===Insufficient consideration of consequences of proposed water saving policies to farm households===
According to Dennis Wichelns of the [[International Water Management Institute]]: "Although one goal of virtual water analysis is to describe opportunities for improving water security, there is almost no mention of the potential impacts of the prescriptions arising from that analysis on farm households in industrialized or developing countries. It is essential to consider more carefully the inherent flaws in the virtual water and water footprint perspectives, particularly when seeking guidance regarding policy decisions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wichelns |first=Dennis |date=2010 |title=Virtual water and water footprints offer limited insight regarding important policy questions |url=http://www.iwmi.cgiar.org/publications/journal-articles/ |journal=International Journal of Water Resources Development |volume=26 |issue=4 |pages=639–651 |doi=10.1080/07900627.2010.519494 |access-date=21 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Regional water scarcity should be taken into account when interpreting water footprint===
The application and interpretation of water footprints may sometimes be used to promote industrial activities that lead to facile criticism of certain products. For example, the 140&amp;nbsp;litres required for coffee production for one cup&lt;ref name="waterfootprintorg" /&gt; might be of no harm to water resources if its cultivation occurs mainly in humid areas, but could be damaging in more arid regions. Other factors such as hydrology, climate, geology, topography, population and demographics should also be taken into account. Nevertheless, high water footprint calculations do suggest that environmental concern may be appropriate.

The use of the term ''footprint'' can also confuse people familiar with the notion of a [[carbon footprint]], because the water footprint concept includes sums of water quantities without necessarily evaluating related impacts. This is in contrast to the carbon footprint, where carbon emissions are not simply summarized but normalized by CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions, which are globally identical, to account for the environmental harm. The difference is due to the somewhat more complex nature of water; while involved in the global hydrological cycle, it is expressed in conditions both local and regional through various forms like river basins, watersheds, on down to groundwater (as part of larger aquifer systems).

==Sustainable water use==
[[Sustainable]] water use involves the rigorous assessment of all source of clean water to establish the current and future rates of use, the impacts of that use both downstream and in the wider area where the water may be used and the impact of  contaminated water streams on the environment and economic well being of the area. It also involves the implementation of [[social policy|social policies]] such as [[water pricing]] in order to manage water demand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eea.europa.eu/themes/water/water-resources/policies-and-measures-to-promote-sustainable-water-use|publisher=Europeanm Environment Agency|title=Policies and measure to promote sustainable water use|access-date=26 April 2016|date=18 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some localities, water may also have spiritual relevance and the use of such water may need to take account of such interests. For example, the [[Māori people|Maori]] believe that water is the source and foundation of all life and have many spiritual associations with water and places associated with water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/tangaroa-the-sea/page-5|title=Tangaroa – the sea - Water as the source of life|author=e Ahukaramū Charles Royal|publisher=Encyclopaedia of New Zealand|date=22 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On a national and global scale, water sustainability requires strategic and long term planning to ensure appropriate sources of clean water are identified and the environmental and economic impact of such choices are understood and accepted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/environment/water-consumption-and-sustainable-water-resources-management_9789264162648-en|title=Water Consumption and Sustainable Water Resources Management|access-date=26 April 2016|isbn=9789264162648 |publisher=OECD Library|date=25 March 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; The re-use and reclamation of water is also part of sustainability including downstream impacts on both surface waters and [[ground water]]s.&lt;ref name=naumann&gt;{{cite book|last=Naumann|first=Ruth|title=Sustainability|date=2011|publisher=Cengage Learning|location=North Shore, N.Z.|isbn=978-017021-034-8|pages=56–58|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sectoral distributions of withdrawn water use==
Several nations estimate sectoral distribution of use of water withdrawn from surface and groundwater sources. For example, in Canada, in 2005, 42 billion m³ of withdrawn water were used, of which about 38 billion m³ were freshwater. Distribution of this use among sectors was: thermoelectric power generation 66.2%, manufacturing 13.6%, residential 9.0%, agriculture 4.7%, commercial and institutional 2.7%, water treatment and distribution systems   2.3%, mining  1.1%, and oil and gas extraction 0.5%.  The 38 billion cu.m of freshwater withdrawn in that year can be compared with the nation’s annual freshwater yield (estimated as streamflow) of 3,472 billion cu.m.&lt;ref&gt;Statistics Canada.  2010.  Human activity and the environment.  Freshwater supply and demand in Canada.  Catalogue no. 16-201-X.&lt;/ref&gt;   Sectoral distribution is different in many respects in the US, where agriculture accounts for about 39% of fresh water withdrawals, thermoelectric power generation 38%, industrial 4%, residential 1%, and mining (including oil and gas) 1%.&lt;ref name=Maupin2014/&gt;

Within the agricultural sector, withdrawn water use is for irrigation and for livestock.  Whereas all irrigation in the US (including loss in conveyance of irrigation water) is estimated to account for about 38 percent of US withdrawn freshwater use,&lt;ref name=Maupin2014&gt;Maupin, M. A. et al. 2014. Estimated use of water in the United States 2010.  U. S. Geological Survey Circular 1405. 55 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; the irrigation water used for production of livestock feed and forage has been estimated to account for about 9 percent,&lt;ref&gt;Zering, K. D., T. J. Centner, D. Meyer, G. L. Newton, J. M. Sweeten and S. Woodruff. 2012. Water and land issues associated with animal agriculture: a U.S. perspective. CAST Issue Paper No. 50. Council for Agricultural Science and Technology, Ames, Iowa. 24 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; and other withdrawn freshwater use for the livestock sector (for drinking, washdown of facilities, etc.) is estimated at about 0.7 percent.&lt;ref name=Maupin2014/&gt;  Because agriculture is a major user of withdrawn water, changes in the magnitude and efficiency of its water use are important.  In the US, from 1980 (when agriculture’s withdrawn water use peaked) to 2010, there was a 23 percent reduction in agriculture’s use of withdrawn water,&lt;ref name=Maupin2014/&gt; while US agricultural output increased by 49 percent over that period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/agricultural-productivity-in-the-us.aspx#28247|title=USDA ERS - Agricultural Productivity in the U.S.|author=|date=|website=www.ERS.USDA.gov|access-date=5 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the US, irrigation water application data are collected in the quinquennial Farm and Ranch Irrigation Survey, conducted as part of the Census of Agriculture.  Such data indicate great differences in irrigation water use within various agricultural sectors.  For example, about 14 percent of corn-for-grain land and 11 percent of soybean land in the US are irrigated, compared with 66 percent of vegetable land, 79 percent of orchard land and 97 percent of rice land.&lt;ref name=USDA2009&gt;US Department of Agriculture.  2009. 2007 Census of agriculture.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1684">'''Zolgokh''' ({{lang-mn|Золгох}}) is a traditional Mongolian formal [[greeting]]. Two people hold both their arms out, and the younger person's arms are placed under the elder person's and grasps their elbows to show support for their elder. The two people then touch each other's cheeks, usually accompanied with the phrase ''Amar mend üü'' ({{lang-mn|Амар мэнд үү}}), meaning "Are you well and peaceful?".

==Tsagaan sar==
In Modern contexts, the greeting is usually reserved for [[Tsagaan sar]] celebrations, where people greet each other with zolgokh, while sometimes holding a [[khadag]] and [[suutei tsai]].
[[File:Zolgokh part 2.JPG|thumb|The second of two images depicting the formal Mongolian greeting, the Zolgokh.]]
Zolgokh is usually first performed among family members on the morning of the festival (the husband and wife do not perform the greeting with each other). The greeting is first performed with the eldest people in the family, sometimes accompanied with a gift of money and/or khadag.

==Name==
The greeting would more accurately be termed ''Zolgolt'', but the word "Zolgokh" has become more widespread in English. The verb form in Mongolian is "''Zolgo''", and the "-kh" is added to mean "to ''zolgo''". The noun form of the greeting in Mongolian is thus ''Zolgolt'', the suffix "-lt" being added to form a noun.
