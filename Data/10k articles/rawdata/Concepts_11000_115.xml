[[Image:20-sided dice 250.jpg|thumb|200px|A typical twenty-sided die]]
The '''3d20''' system is the [[role-playing game system]] used in ''[[Neuroshima]]'' and ''[[Monastyr]]''. Like the [[d20 System]], it uses twenty-sided [[dice]], but unlike that system it most typically uses three.

==Core mechanic==
#name the skill to be tested and the difficulty level
#roll three twenty sided [[dice]]
#compare all three separate results with the given [[Attribute (role-playing games)|attribute]]
#if at least two of the three results are lower than the attribute modified by the difficulty level, test is successful.

==Details==
When a test is required, the [[Gamemaster]], names the [[Skill (role-playing games)|skill]] which is going to be tested (or a raw [[Attribute (role-playing games)|attribute]], if no skill is available for the activity the [[Player character|character]] is trying to perform). He also sets a difficulty level for the test, which modifies the attribute value (reducing or improving it). Then, the character's skill level is taken into account - if the character does not have any skill levels in the given skill, (in case of [[Neuroshima]]) the difficulty level is raised by one, or (in case of [[Monastyr]]), all the three rolls (not two) have to be lower than the tested attribute. Otherwise, the player can subtract a total of his character's skill levels in that skill from any of the three dice rolls, each separately.

===Difficulty levels===

|Average
|'''0'''
|Difficult
|'''- 5'''
|Extremely difficult
|'''- 11'''
|}

===Special rules===
*'''Suwak''' ("Slider") is a special rule of this game system. It says that when a character has at least four 4 levels in a skill, each time that skill is tested, the difficulty level is automatically lowered by one; if their skill level is 8 or 12, then difficulty is lowered by two or three levels respectively. It's supposed to depict the fact that the more trained a character becomes, the easier those things they trained seem to them. 
*'''Lucky 1''' - each time when making a test roll a player rolls "1" on any dice, he is lucky and manages to perform easily; in the terms of mechanics, the test is treated as if the difficulty level was lower by one. ''Notice:'' if the player rolls two "1's", the test is automatically successful.

[[File:Adinkra Rattray.JPG|thumb|Adinkra symbols recorded by [[Robert Sutherland Rattray]], 1927]]
'''''Adinkra''''' are [[symbol]]s that represent [[concept]]s or [[aphorism]]s. ''Adinkra'' are used extensively in fabrics and pottery among the [[Ashanti people|Ashanti]]s of [[Ashanti Region|Ashanti Kingdom]] and the [[Baoulé people|baoules]] who historically migrated from [[Ghana]]. They are incorporated into walls and other architectural features.  Fabric ''adinkra'' are often made by [[woodcut]] sign writing as well as [[screen printing]]. ''Adinkra'' symbols appear on some traditional [[Akan goldweights]]. The symbols are also carved on stools for domestic and ritual use. Tourism has led to new departures in the use of the symbols in such items as T-shirts and jewellery.
[[File:AdinkraCalabashStamps.jpg|thumb|Calabash adinkra stamps carved in Ntonso, [[Ashanti Region|Ashanti]].]]

The symbols have a decorative function but also represent objects that encapsulate evocative messages that convey traditional wisdom, aspects of life or the environment. There are many different symbols with distinct meanings, often linked with [[proverb]]s. In the words of [[Kwame Anthony Appiah]], they were one of the means for "supporting the transmission of a complex and nuanced body of practice and belief".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Appiah|first=Kwame Anthony|title=In my father's house : Africa in the philosophy of culture|year=1993|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-506852-8|edition=1st paperback edition 1993.|authorlink=Kwame Anthony Appiah}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Adinkra cloth.JPG|thumb|1817 Adinkra mourning cloth]]

[[Ashanti people|Ashanti]] oral tradition attributes the origin of ''adinkra'' to [[Gyaaman|Gyaman]] in modern-day  [[Ghana]] .&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stlawu.edu/gallery/education/f/09textiles/adinkra_symbols.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ghanaculturepolitics.com/history-and-origin-of-adinkra-symbols/|title=History and Origin of Adinkra Symbols|date=25 April 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://afrolegends.com/2014/08/27/adinkra-symbols-and-the-rich-akan-culture/|title=Adinkra Symbols and the Rich Akan Culture|date=27 August 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Englishman [[Thomas Edward Bowdich]] collected a piece of ''adinkra'' cloth in 1817, which demonstrates that ''adinkra'' art existed at least since this time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history.buffalo.edu/documents/SeemanWMQ.pdf Adinkra cloth history] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100611175932/http://www.history.buffalo.edu/documents/SeemanWMQ.pdf |date=2010-06-11 }}. [[University at Buffalo]].&lt;/ref&gt; Bowdich obtained this cotton cloth in [[Kumasi]], the capital of the [[Ashanti Empire]]. The patterns were printed using carved [[calabash]] stamps and a vegetable-based dye. The cloth features fifteen stamped symbols, including ''nsroma'' (stars), ''dono ntoasuo'' (double Dono drums), and diamonds. It is now in the [[British Museum]].
[[File:Adinkra 1825.jpg|thumb|1825 Adinkra cloth]]
The next oldest piece of ''adinkra'' textile was sent in 1825 from the [[Elmina Castle]] to the royal [[cabinet of curiosities]] in [[The Hague]], in response to an assignment from Major F. Last, who was appointed temporary Commander of [[Dutch Gold Coast]]. He probably had the cloth commissioned for [[William I of the Netherlands]], which would explain why the [[Coat of arms of the Netherlands]] is in the centre. The other motifs are typical of the older ''adinkras''. It is now on display in the [[National Museum of Ethnology (Netherlands)|National Museum of Ethnology in Leiden]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.volkenkunde.nl/rmv/internet/eain_ghana.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-04-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322165030/http://www.volkenkunde.nl/rmv/internet/eain_ghana.html |archivedate=2012-03-22 |df= }} clickable image on right links to description&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Adinkra'' cloth==
''Adinkra'' cloths were traditionally only worn by royalty and spiritual leaders for funerals and other very special occasions. In the past they were hand printed on undyed, red, dark brown or black hand-woven cotton fabric depending on the occasion and the wearer's role; nowadays they are frequently mass-produced on brighter coloured fabrics.

[[File:NtonsoAdinkra.jpg|thumb|Anthony Boakye prints an adinkra cloth with a calabash stamp in Ntonso, [[Ashanti Region|Ashanti]].]]

The present centre of traditional production of ''adinkra'' cloth is Ntɔnso, 20&amp;nbsp;km northwest of Kumasi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfam.org.uk/coolplanet/ontheline/schools/adinkra/adinkrah.htm|title=Cool Planet - Oxfam Education|website=Oxfam GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dark Adinkra ''aduro'' pigment for the stamping is made there, by soaking, pulverizing, and boiling the inner bark and roots of the badie tree (''[[Bridelia]] ferruginea'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Jansen|first = P. C. M.|year = 2005|title = Dyes and Tannins|publisher = PROTA (Plant Resources of Tropical Africa)|page = 102|isbn = 9057821591|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=dVBYe0SK1TwC&amp;pg=PA102&amp;lpg=PA102|accessdate = 2013-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; in water over a wood fire. Once the dark colour is released, the mixture is strained, and then boiled for several more hours until it thickens. The  stamps are carved out of the bottom of a [[calabash]] piece. They measure between five and eight centimetres square. They have a handle on the back, and the stamp itself is slightly curved, so that the dye can be put on with a rocking motion.

==Symbols listed by Rattray==
[[File:Adinkra motifs Rattray 1927.jpg|thumb|390px|Symbols recorded by [[Robert Sutherland Rattray]]]]
[[Robert Sutherland Rattray]] recorded a sample of fifty three ''adinkra'' symbols and their meanings in his ''Religion and Art in [[Ashanti Region|Ashanti]]'' (Oxford, 1927):
# ''Gyawu Atiko'', lit. the back of Gyawu's head. Gyawu was a sub-chief of Bantama who at the annual Odwira ceremony is said to have had his hair shaved in this fashion.

# ''Mpuannum'', lit. five tufts (of hair).
# ''Duafe'', the wooden comb.
# ''DAME-DAME'', symbol of intelligence and ingenuity lit.name of a board game.
# ''Aya'', the fern; the word also means 'I am not afraid of you', 'I am independent of you' and the wearer may imply this by wearing it.
# ''Aban'', a two-storied house, a castle; this design was formerly worn by the King of Ashanti alone.
# ''Nkotimsefuopua'', certain attendants on the Queen Mother who dressed their hair in this fashion. It is really a variation of the swastika.
# ''[[Sankofa]]'', lit. turn back and fetch it. See also No. 27.
# ''Sankofa'', lit. turn back and fetch it. See also No. 27.

# ''Nkonsonkonson'', lit. links of a chain; as No. 44.
# ''Nyame dua'', an altar to the Sky God.
# ''Agyindawuru'', the agyin's (a tree) gong. The juice of a tree of that name is sometimes squeezed into a gong and is said to make the sound pleasing to the spirits.

# ''Adinkira ‘hene'', the Adinkira king, and ‘chief’ of all these Adinkira designs. See No. 34.
# ''Fihankra'', the circular house. 
# ''Papani amma yenhu Kramo''. 'The (large number of) people who do good prevents us knowing who really are Mohammedans' (i.e. as adherents of Islam are enjoined to do good works in the community, and increasing numbers of non-Muslims are also doing so, we can no longer use that criterion to distinguish those Muslims living amongst us). 
# ''Mmrafo ani ase'', the [[keloid]]s on a Hausa man.
# ''Musuyidie'', lit. something to remove evil; a cloth with this design stamped upon it lay beside the sleeping couch of the King of Ashanti, and every morning when he rose he placed his left foot upon it three times.
# ''Nyame, biribi wo soro, ma no me ka me nsa''. 'O God, everything which is above, permit my hand to touch it.' This pattern was stamped on paper and hung above the lintel of a door in the palace. The King of Ashanti used to touch lintel, then his forehead, then his breast, repeating these words three times. 
# As No. 13. 
# ''Akam'', an edible plant (yam?). 
# ''Se die fofoo pe, ne se gyinantwi abo bedie''. 'What the yellow-flowered fofoo plant wants is that the gyinantwi seeds should turn black.' This is a well-known Ashanti saying. One of the cotton cloth designs bears the same name.

# ''Dwenini aben'', the ram's horns.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9451">'''Agriculturalism''', also known as the '''School of Agrarianism''', the '''School of Agronomists''', the '''School of Tillers''', and in Chinese as the ''Nongjia'' (農家/农家), was an early [[Agrarianism|agrarian]] [[Chinese philosophy]] that advocated peasant [[utopian]] [[communalism]] and [[egalitarianism]], and was arguably the world's first [[Communist]] and [[Socialist]] movement that believed in a [[Classless society]].&lt;ref name="wp"&gt;{{cite book|last= Deutsch |first=Eliot |author2= Ronald Bontekoei|year=1999 | page= 183|title=A companion to world philosophies|publisher=Wiley Blackwell}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Agriculturalists believed that Chinese society should be modeled around that of the early sage king [[Shennong]], a folk hero who was portrayed in Chinese literature as "working in the fields, along with everyone else, and consulting with everyone else when any decision had to be reached."&lt;ref name="wp" /&gt; They encouraged farming and agriculture and taught farming and cultivation techniques, as they believed that agricultural development was the key to a stable and prosperous society.

Agriculturalism was suppressed during the [[Qin Dynasty]] and most original texts are now lost.
However, concepts originally associated with Agriculturalism have influenced [[Confucianism]], [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalism]], and [[Chinese philosophy]] as a whole.&lt;ref name="js"/&gt; Agriculturalism has significantly influenced Chinese thought, and has been viewed as an essence of the Chinese identity.&lt;ref name="dg"&gt;{{cite book|last= Gladney |first=Dru|year=2004 | page= 300|title=Dislocating China|publisher=University of Chicago Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{see also|Hundred Schools of Thought}}
[[Image:Shennong3.jpg|thumb|To the Agriculturalists, the governance and focus on agriculture by the legendary ruler [[Shennong]] served as a model of the ideal government.]]
Agriculturalism dates back to the [[Spring and Autumn period]] and [[Warring States period]], during a period known as the "[[Hundred Schools of Thought]]" which flourished from 770 to 221 BC. Throughout this period, competing states, seeking to war with one another and unite China as a single country, patronized philosophers, scholars, and teachers. The competition by scholars for the attention of rulers led to the development of different schools of thought, and the emphasis on recording teachings into books encouraged their spread.&lt;ref name="pe"&gt;{{cite book|last= Ebrey |first=Patricia|year=2010 | page= 42|title=The Cambridge Illustrated History of China|publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The result was an era characterized by significant intellectual and cultural developments.&lt;ref name="pe"/&gt; The major philosophies of China, [[Confucianism]], [[Mohism]], [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalism]], and [[Taoism]], all originated from this period.

Chinese tradition attributes the origin of Agriculturalism to the Chinese minister [[Hou Ji]], a figure known for his innovations in agriculture.&lt;ref name="js"&gt;{{cite book|last= Sellmann |first=James Daryl|year=2010 | page= 76|title=Timing and rulership in Master Lü's Spring and Autumn annals|publisher=SUNY Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Agriculturalists also emphasized the role of [[Shennong]], the divine farmer, a semi-mythical ruler of early China credited by the Chinese as the inventor of agriculture. Shennong was seen as a proto-Agriculturalist, whose governance and focus on agriculture served as a model of the ideal Agriculturalist government.&lt;ref name="js"/&gt;

[[Xu Xing (philosopher)|Xu Xing]], a philosopher who defended Agriculturalism, settled with a group of followers in the state of [[Teng (state)|Teng]] in about 315 BC. A disciple of his visited the Confucian philosopher [[Mencius]], and a short report of their conversation discussing Xu Xing's philosophy survives.&lt;ref name=graham&gt;{{cite journal |title=The "Nung-chia" 農 家 'School of the Tillers' and the Origins of Peasant Utopianism in China|author=A. C. Graham|journal=Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies|volume=42|number=1|year=1979|pages=66–100|jstor=614828|doi=10.1017/s0041977x00108468}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rise of the [[Qin Dynasty]] in 221 BC saw the [[Burning of books and burying of scholars|purge of the Hundred Schools of Thought]], including Agriculturalism. The Legalist Qin dynasty was intolerant of other schools of thought, seeking to burn any text that did not adhere to the Legalist philosophy.&lt;ref name="sc"&gt;{{cite book|last= Ong |first= Siew Chey|year=2005 | page= 16|title=China condensed: 5000 years of history &amp; culture |publisher=Marshall Cavendish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, few Agriculturalist texts exist, and most of what is known of Agriculturalism comes from critical assessments by other philosophical schools.&lt;ref name="js"/&gt;

The bibliography of the [[Book of Han]] (2nd century AD) presents Agriculturalism as one of 10 philosophical schools and lists 9 books belonging to that school.&lt;ref name=graham/&gt;

==Philosophy==
Agriculturalism is primarily a social, economic, and political philosophy. The philosophy is founded on the notion that human society originates with the development of [[agriculture]], and societies are based upon "people's natural prospensity to farm."&lt;ref name="js"/&gt; The Agriculturalists described the ancient political system, seen as ideal, as one where "the means by which the early sage kings led their people was to put agriculture before all other affairs.. the reason why Hou Ji undertook agriculture was because he considered it to be the root of instructing the masses."&lt;ref name="js"/&gt;

===Political===
To the Agriculturalists, the ideal society, modeled after that of [[Shennong]]'s, is [[communalism|communal]], [[agrarianism|agrarian]], and [[egalitarianism|egalitarian]].&lt;ref name="wp"/&gt; The Agriculturalist believed that the ideal government is led by a benevolent king, one who works alongside the people in tilling the fields. The Agriculturalist king is not paid by the government through its treasuries; his livelihood is derived from the profits he earns working in the fields and cooking his own meals, not his leadership.&lt;ref name="dw"/&gt; Said [[Xu Xing (philosopher)|Xu Xing]], a prominent Agriculturalist:
{{quote|The ruler of Teng is an upright and worthy ruler. However, he has yet to hear the Way. A wise ruler tills the land together with his people to make his living. He governs while cooking his own meals. Now, that Teng has granaries and treasuries means that [the ruler] inflicts hardship on the people to fatten himself. How can he be a worthy ruler?|Xu Xing&lt;ref name="dw"/&gt;}}

===Economic===
Unlike the Confucians, the Agriculturalists did not believe in the [[division of labour]], arguing instead that the economic policies of a country need to be based upon an egalitarian [[self sufficiency]].&lt;ref name="dw"/&gt; The Agriculturalists supported the [[price fixing|fixing of prices]], in which all similar goods, regardless of differences in quality and demand, are set at exactly the same, unchanging price. They suggested that people should be paid the same amount for the same services, a policy criticized by the Confucians as encouraging products of low quality, which "destroys the earnest standards of craftmanship."&lt;ref name="dw"/&gt;

==Reception==
Agriculturalism was criticized extensively by rival philosophical schools, including the [[Mohist]] [[Mo Zi]], the Confucian [[Mencius]], and [[Yang Zhu]].&lt;ref name="js"/&gt; [[Mencius]] criticized its chief proponent [[Xu Xing (philosopher)|Xu Xing]] for advocating that rulers should work in the fields with their subjects, arguing that the Agriculturalist egalitarianism ignored the [[division of labour]] central to society. He points out that other early Chinese rulers did not work in fields, yet were equally as successful and revered as Shennong.&lt;ref name="dw"/&gt; Mencius dismisses Xu Xing as a "Southern barbarian with a twittering tongue."&lt;ref name="dw"&gt;{{cite book|last= Denecke|first=Wiebke|year=2011 | page= 38|title=The Dynamics of Masters Literature: Early Chinese Thought from Confucius to Han Feizi|publisher=Harvard University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Influence===
{{see also|Agrarianism}}
The Legalist [[Qin Dynasty]] [[Burning of books and burying of scholars|purged rival philosophical schools]], including Agriculturalism, burning many Agriculturalist texts. However, Agriculturalism in its heyday heavily influenced the agrarian policies of [[Confucianism]], Legalism, and other philosophical schools,&lt;ref name="js"/&gt; so many concepts originally associated with the Agriculturalists continued to exist in Chinese philosophy. The transmission and translation of Chinese philosophical texts in Europe during the 18th century had a heavy influence on the development of [[Agrarianism]] in [[Europe]]. The French agrarianist philosophy, a predecessor to modern Agrarianism, of [[François Quesnay]] and the [[Physiocrats]], are said to have been modeled after the agrarian policies of Chinese philosophy.&lt;ref name="lam"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Maverick|first1= Lewis A.|year=1938|title= Chinese Influences Upon the Physiocrats|journal=Economic History|volume=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alton Wayne Roberts''' (April 6, 1938 – September 11, 1999) was a [[Ku Klux Klan|Klansman]] convicted of depriving slain activists [[Michael Schwerner]], [[Andrew Goodman]] and [[James Chaney]] of their [[civil rights]] in 1964. He personally shot two of the three civil rights workers before his accomplices buried their bodies in a dam.

==Early life==
Roberts had a younger brother by the name of Raymond.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iD6rL_e8VZMC&amp;pg=PA273&amp;lpg=PA273&amp;dq=alton+wayne+roberts&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=wQjoQqaB5X&amp;sig=W07_K8AGE5-dOd7RXmchSY89CiA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=8Zv_VI7xBKfmsASrmoLADw&amp;ved=0CB8Q6AEwADgy#v=onepage&amp;q=alton%20wayne%20roberts&amp;f=false|last=Feldman|first=Jay|title=Manufacturing Hysteria: A History of Scapegoating, Surveillance, and Secrecy in Modern America|year=2012|publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group|isbn=9780307388230}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tlvs7498TJMC&amp;pg=PA84&amp;lpg=PA84&amp;dq=alton+wayne+roberts&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Ie-1iC1oCf&amp;sig=gT1_Qwp0-jGyG_dQJVVZLcx4AfQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Lpr_VKWEJciIsQSw3IHwBQ&amp;ved=0CFEQ6AEwCDgK#v=onepage&amp;q=alton%20wayne%20roberts&amp;f=false|last=Chalmers|first=David Mark|title=Backfire: How the Ku Klux Klan Helped the Civil Rights Movement|year=2005|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=9780742523111}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2-84635lwKYC&amp;pg=PA298&amp;lpg=PA298&amp;dq=alton+wayne+roberts&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=xazSltWpK3&amp;sig=VVKDJIr1IeeQLuTaX6Qtn0RZpeE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=y5v_VNXjOaOxsAS5mYDwDA&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAzgo#v=onepage&amp;q=alton%20wayne%20roberts&amp;f=false|last=Sims|first=Patsy|title=The Klan|year=1996|publisher=University Press of Kentucky|isbn=9780813108872}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Roberts played [[American football|football]] during [[high school]].&lt;ref name=people&gt;{{cite web|last=McWhorter|first=Diane|title=Since Mississippi Burned|date=9 January 1989|publisher=''[[People (magazine)|People]]''|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20119300,00.html|accessdate=10 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roberts, then 26 years old,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LJD4mjtUgOQC&amp;pg=PA144&amp;lpg=PA144&amp;dq=alton+wayne+roberts&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=xBYmSoEK5C&amp;sig=HG3IjyQEg6MgTj3NuUlErwEPWog&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=-pr_VJS1GsK1sATHyoL4DA&amp;ved=0CCIQ6AEwATge#v=onepage&amp;q=alton%20wayne%20roberts&amp;f=false|last=Mars|first=Florence|title=Witness in Philadelphia|year=1989|publisher=LSU Press|isbn=9780807115664}}&lt;/ref&gt; owned a [[Bar (establishment)|bar]] in [[Meridian, Mississippi]] at the time of the murders.&lt;ref name=jackson/&gt;

==Freedom Summer Murders==
{{main|Murders of Chaney, Goodman, and Schwerner}}

In the afternoon of June 21, 1964, Chaney, Goodman, &amp; Schwerner arrived at Longdale to inspect the burned out church in Neshoba County. They left Longdale around 3 p.m. They were to be in Meridian by 4 p.m. that day. The fastest route to Meridian was through Philadelphia. At the fork of Beacon &amp; Main Street their station wagon sustained a flat tire. It is possible that a shot was fired at the station wagon's tire. Sheriff Lawrence Rainey's home was near the Beacon &amp; Main Street fork. Deputy Cecil Price soon arrived and escorted them to the county jail. Price released the trio as soon as the longest day of the year became night which was about 10 p.m. The three was last seen heading south in their Ford station wagon along Highway 19 toward Meridian.

Two Mississippi Highway Patrol men waited at Pilgrim's Gas Station not far from Philadelphia's city limits. The trio was likely deferred from using a phone at the station. They drove past the station and continued toward Meridian.

===Lynch mob===

The lynch mob, in Horace D. Barnette's and Billy W. Posey's cars, was drinking while arguing who would kill the three men. Eventually Philadelphia Police Officer Other N. Burkes drove up to Barnette's car and told the mob that "they're going on 19 toward Meridian. Follow them!" After a quick rendezvous with Philadelphia Police Officer Richard Willis, Price was in pursuit of the three civil rights workers. Posey's Chevrolet carried Jerry M. Sharpe, Jimmy L. Townsend, and Alton W. Roberts. Horace Barnette had a two-toned blue Ford Fairlane sedan. In Horace's car were James Jordan, Jimmy K. Arledge, Jimmy Snowden, Roberts, and Posey. Posey's car apparently had carburetor problems and broke down on the side of the road. Sharpe and Townsend were ordered to stay with the car and get it running again. Price eventually caught the CORE station wagon heading west toward Union, Mississippi on state highway 492.

Soon the three civil right workers would be escorted north on Highway 19 to secluded Rock Cut Road where they would be executed at the hand of Roberts and Jordan.

When they arrived, Roberts reportedly pulled Schwerner out of the car, pointing a gun at his chest. "Are you that nigger lover?" Roberts asked, his left hand on Schwerner's shoulder.  "Sir, I know just how you feel," Schwerner replied.  Roberts then shot him in the heart and then grabbed Goodman, shooting him in the chest near his right shoulder.  Chaney ran, but Roberts along with other Klansmen were able to shoot him dead before he could run any farther.  Roberts fired into Chaney's lower back and his head.&lt;ref name=jackson&gt;{{cite web|last=Ladd|first=Donna|title=Down a Southern Road|date=21 June 2004|publisher=''[[Jackson Free Press]]''|url=http://www.jacksonfreepress.com/news/2004/jun/21/down-a-southern-road/|accessdate=10 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prosecutors said that Roberts fired two of the three bullets found in Chaney's body.&lt;ref name=people/&gt; After the murders James Jordan was accused of saying "well, you didn't leave me nothing but a nigger, but at least I killed me a nigger."

==Conviction==
{{main|United States v. Price}}

On December 4, 1964, The Federal Bureau of Investigation arrested several men for engineering a conspiracy to injure, oppress, threaten, and intimidate Chaney, Goodman, and Schwerner.&lt;ref name=fbiapprehend&gt;{{cite news|title=Day of Accusation in Mississippi|first=David|last=Nevin |date=December 1964 |work=Life |pages=36–37}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Roberts was one of many rounded up that day.

Roberts was indicted on February 28, 1967. He went to federal trial in Meridian on October 7 of that same year; 13 days later, he was convicted.&lt;ref name=book&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wr9Ehq158DUC&amp;pg=PA136&amp;lpg=PA136&amp;dq=alton+wayne+roberts&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=S7zpGzGAIN&amp;sig=H6wrcB9lavy4H3Y-xgU7VpO7Yc8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=gJr_VIPZKfDisASooIAw&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwBDgU#v=onepage&amp;q=alton%20wayne%20roberts&amp;f=false|last=Putnam|first=Richelle|title=Lauderdale County, Mississippi: A Brief History|year=2011|publisher=The History Press|isbn=9781609490218}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At the sentence hearing on December 29, 1967, Judge [[William Harold Cox]] sentenced Roberts 10 years in federal prison.&lt;ref name=jackson/&gt;&lt;ref name=book/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-p_zy5V5NXUC&amp;pg=PA151&amp;lpg=PA151&amp;dq=alton+wayne+roberts&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=nJakB0oVwl&amp;sig=6KYOKUxi1muRjDevT2VUDF8EdJU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=WJv_VOzIDKawsAT2s4GwBg&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwBzge#v=onepage&amp;q=alton%20wayne%20roberts&amp;f=false|last=Dickerson|first=James|title=Dixie's Dirty Secret: The True Story of how the Government, the Media, and the Mob Conspired to Combat Integration and the Vietnam Antiwar Movement|year=1998|publisher=M.E.

===Encounter with Laurens Pierce===
Roberts gained national recognition on January 27, 1965 when Jack Thornell took photos of him beating up [[CBS]] cameraman Laurens Pierce outside the federal courthouse in Meridian where he was in trial at the time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apimages.com/metadata/Index/Associated-Press-Domestic-News-Mississippi-Unit-/da3d82e2c3e3da11af9f0014c2589dfb CBS cameraman Laurens Pierce, left, struggles for his camera with Alton Wayne Roberts outside the Federal Building in Meridian, Miss., Jan. 27, 1965.

{{Contains Indic text}}
{{Hinduism}}

An '''avatar''' ([[Sanskrit]]: अवतार, [[IAST]]: ''{{IAST|avatāra}}''), a concept in [[Hinduism]] that means "descent", refers to the material appearance or [[incarnation]] of a [[deity]] on earth.&lt;ref name=jameslochtefeldavatar/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Geoffrey Parrinder |authorlink=Geoffrey Parrinder|title=Avatar and Incarnation: The Divine in Human Form in the World's Religions |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VkV5AAAAMAAJ |year=1997|publisher=Oneworld |isbn=978-1-85168-130-3|pages=19–20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The relative verb to "alight, to make one's appearance" is sometimes used to refer to any [[guru]] or revered human being.&lt;ref name=monierwilliamsavatar/&gt;{{Sfn|Sheth|2002|pp=98-99}}

The word ''avatar'' does not appear in the Vedic literature,&lt;ref name="Bassuk1987p3"&gt;{{cite book|author=Daniel E Bassuk |title=Incarnation in Hinduism and Christianity: The Myth of the God-Man |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k3iwCwAAQBAJ |year=1987|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |isbn=978-1-349-08642-9 |pages=2–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; but appears in verb forms in post-Vedic literature, and as a noun particularly in the [[Purana|Puranic]] literature after the 6th century CE.{{Sfn|Paul Hacker|1978|pp=424, also 405–409, 414–417}} Despite that, the concept of an avatar is compatible with the content of the Vedic literature like the [[Upanishads]] as it is symbolic imagery of the [[Saguna Brahman]] concept in the philosophy of Hinduism. The ''[[Rigveda]]'' describes [[Indra]] as endowed with a mysterious power of assuming any form at will.&lt;ref&gt;Rig Veda 3.53.8 (Maghavan); 6.47.18 (Indra)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Swami Harshananda, ''A Concise Encyclopaedia of Hinduism'', Ramakrishna Math, Bangalore (2008) Vol.1, page 221&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--Commenting out the following, because we don't interpret WP:Primary in Wikipedia, please also add a secondary source for this: Some of the Avataras from the list of the ten Avataras of Vishnu, are mentioned in the earlier Vedic literature. ''[[Satapatha Brahmana]]'' mentions the stories of the Matsya, Kurma, Varaha and Vamana Avataras.&lt;ref&gt;Satapatha Brahmana 1.8.1.1-6; 7.5.1.5; 14.1.2.11; 1.2.5.1&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt; The ''Bhagavad Gita'' expounds the doctrine of Avatara but with terms other than ''avatar''.{{Sfn|Paul Hacker|1978|pp=424, also 405–409, 414–417}}{{Sfn|Sheth|2002|pages=98–99}}

Theologically, the term is most often associated with the Hindu god [[Vishnu]], though the idea has been applied to other deities.&lt;ref name="Gale's"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kinsley|first=David|title=Gale's Encyclopedia of Religion|editor=Lindsay Jones|publisher=Thomson Gale|year=2005|edition=Second|volume=2|pages=707–708|isbn=978-0-02-865735-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Varying lists of avatars of Vishnu appear in Hindu scriptures, including the ten [[Dashavatara]] of the ''[[Garuda Purana]]'' and the twenty-two avatars in the ''[[Bhagavata Purana]]'', though the latter adds that the incarnations of Vishnu are innumerable.&lt;ref name="Bryant"&gt;{{cite book| last=Bryant| first=Edwin Francis|title=Krishna: A Sourcebook| publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] US| year=2007| page=18 | isbn=978-0-19-514891-6| url=https://books.google.com/?id=0z02cZe8PU8C&amp;pg=PT32}}&lt;/ref&gt; The avatars of Vishnu are important in [[Vaishnavism]] theology. In the goddess-based [[Shaktism]] tradition of Hinduism, avatars of the [[Devi]] in different appearances such as [[Tripura Sundari]], [[Durga]] and [[Kali]] are commonly found.{{Sfn|Sheth|2002|pages=98–125}}&lt;ref name="Hawley"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hawley|first=John Stratton|author2=Vasudha Narayanan|title=The life of Hinduism|publisher=[[University of California Press]]|year=2006|page=174|isbn=978-0-520-24914-1|url=https://books.google.com/?id=7DLj1tYmoTQC&amp;pg=PA174}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David R.

Incarnation concepts similar to ''avatar'' are also found in [[Buddhism]],{{Sfn|Sheth|2002|pp=115-116 with note 2}} [[Christianity]],&lt;ref name="Bassuk1987p3"/&gt; and other religions.{{Sfn|Sheth|2002|pp=115-116 with note 2}} The scriptures of Sikhism include the names of numerous Hindu gods and goddesses, but it rejected the doctrine of savior incarnation and endorsed the view of Hindu Bhakti movement saints such as [[Namdev]] that formless eternal god is within the human heart and man is his own savior.&lt;ref name=enesbittavatar/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Shackle and Arvind Mandair (2005), Teachings of the Sikh Gurus, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415266048}}, pages xxxiv-xli&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology and meaning==

The Sanskrit noun (''{{IAST|avatāra}}'' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|v|ə|t|ɑr|,_|ˌ|æ|v|ə|ˈ|t|ɑr}};&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/avatar "avatar"]. ''[[Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPA-hns|əʋˈtaːr|lang}}) is derived from the Sanskrit roots ''ava'' (down) and {{IAST|''tṛ''}} (to cross over).{{Sfn|Sheth|2002|p=98}} These roots trace back, states Monier-Williams, to ''-taritum'', ''-tarati'', ''-rītum''.&lt;ref name=monierwilliamsavatar&gt;{{cite book|author=Monier Monier-Williams|title=A Sanskrit-English Dictionary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_3NWAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA90|year=1923|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=90}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Avatar'' literally means "descent, alight, to make one's appearance",&lt;ref name=monierwilliamsavatar/&gt; and refers to the embodiment of the essence of a superhuman being or a deity in another form.{{Sfn|Sheth|2002|p=98}} The word also implies "to overcome, to remove, to bring down, to cross something".&lt;ref name=monierwilliamsavatar/&gt; In Hindu traditions, the "crossing or coming down" is symbolism, states Daniel Bassuk, of the divine descent from "eternity into the temporal realm, from unconditioned to the conditioned, from infinitude to finitude".&lt;ref name="Bassuk1987p3"/&gt; An avatar, states Justin Edwards Abbott, is a ''saguna'' (with form, attributes) embodiment of the ''[[nirguna]]'' [[Brahman]] or [[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]] (soul).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Justin Edwards Abbott |title=Life of Tukaram: Translation from Mahipati's Bhaktalilamrita |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E-UmxAoX2wYC|year=1980|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-0170-7|pages=335–336 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neither the [[Vedas]] nor the [[Principal Upanishads]] ever mention the word ''avatar'' as a noun.&lt;ref name="Bassuk1987p3"/&gt; The verb roots and form, such as ''avatarana'', do appear in ancient post-Vedic Hindu texts, but as "action of descending", but not as an incarnated person (avatara).{{Sfn|Paul Hacker|1978|pp=415-417}} The related verb ''avatarana'' is, states Paul Hacker, used with double meaning, one as action of the divine descending, another as "laying down the burden of man" suffering from the forces of evil.{{Sfn|Paul Hacker|1978|pp=415-417}}

The term is most commonly found in the context of the Hindu god [[Vishnu]].&lt;ref name=jameslochtefeldavatar/&gt;&lt;ref name=monierwilliamsavatar/&gt; The earliest mention of Vishnu manifested in a human form to empower the good and fight against evil, uses other terms such as the word ''sambhavāmi'' in verse 4.6 and the word ''tanu'' in verse 9.11 of the [[Bhagavad Gita]],{{Sfn|Sheth|2002|pp=98-99}} as well as other words such as ''akriti'' and ''rupa'' elsewhere.{{Sfn|Paul Hacker|1978|pp=405-409}} It is in medieval era texts, those composed after the sixth century CE, that the noun version of avatar appears, where it means embodiment of a deity.{{Sfn|Paul Hacker|1978|pp=424, also 405-409, 414-417}} The idea proliferates thereafter, in the [[Purana|Puranic]] stories for many deities, and with ideas such as ''ansha-avatar'' or partial embodiments.{{Sfn|Sheth|2002|pp=98-99}}&lt;ref name=jameslochtefeldavatar&gt;James Lochtefeld (2002), "Avatar" in The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism, Vol. 1: A-M, Rosen Publishing, {{ISBN|0-8239-2287-1}}, pages 72-73&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''avatar'', in colloquial use, is also an epithet or a word of reverence for any extraordinary human being who is revered for his or her ideas.{{Sfn|Sheth|2002|p=98}} In some contexts, the term ''avatara'' just means a "landing place, site of sacred pilgrimage", or just "achieve one's goals after effort", or retranslation of a text in another language.&lt;ref name=monierwilliamsavatar/&gt; The term ''avatar'' is not unique to Hinduism. It is found in the ''Trikaya'' doctrine of Mahayana Buddhism, in descriptions for the [[Dalai Lama]] in Tibetan Buddhism, and many ancient cultures.{{Sfn|Sheth|2002|pp=115-116 with note 2}}

===Avatar versus incarnation===
The manifest embodiment is sometimes referred to as an [[incarnation]].&lt;ref name=kimctap192&gt;{{cite book|author=Sebastian C. H. Kim |title=Christian Theology in Asia |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hXh3iq94MWIC |year=2008|publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-1-139-47206-7 |pages=169–176 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The translation of avatar as "incarnation" has been questioned by Christian theologians, who state that an incarnation is in flesh and imperfect, while avatar is mythical and perfect.{{Sfn|Sheth|2002|pp=107-109}}&lt;ref name="Matchett"&gt;{{cite book|last=Matchett|first=Freda|title=Krishna, Lord or Avatara?: the relationship between Krishna and Vishnu|publisher=9780700712816|year=2001|page=4|url=https://books.google.com/?id=1oqTYiPeAxMC&amp;pg=PA4 | isbn=978-0-7007-1281-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theological concept of Christ as an incarnation, as found in [[Christology]], presents the Christian concept of incarnation. According to Oduyoye and Vroom, this is different from the Hindu concept of avatar because avatars in Hinduism are unreal and is similar to [[Docetism]].&lt;ref&gt;Mercy Amba Oduyoye, H. M. Vroom, ''One gospel&amp;nbsp;– many cultures: case studies and reflections on cross-cultural theology'', Rodopi, 2003, {{ISBN|978-90-420-0897-7}}, p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt; Sheth disagrees and states that this claim is an incorrect understanding of the Hindu concept of avatar.{{Sfn|Sheth|2002|p=108}}{{Refn|group=note|Buddha, a real person, is included as an avatar of Vishnu in many Hindu texts.{{Sfn|Sheth|2002|p=99}}}} Avatars are true embodiments of spiritual perfection, one driven by noble goals, in Hindu traditions such as [[Vaishnavism]].{{Sfn|Sheth|2002|p=108}}

==Avatars of Vishnu==
{{Main|Vishnu}}
The concept of avatar within Hinduism is most often associated with Vishnu, the preserver or sustainer aspect of God within the Hindu Trinity or [[Trimurti]] of Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva. Vishnu's avatars descend to empower the good and fight evil, thereby restoring [[Dharma]]. Traditional Hindus see themselves not as "Hindu", but as Vaishnava (Worshippers of Vishnu), Shaiva (Worshippers of Shiva), or Shakta (Worshipper of the Shakti). Each of the deities has its own iconography and mythology, but common to all is the fact that the divine reality  has an explicit form, a form that the worshipper can behold. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Religions in the Modern World- Traditions and Transformations, 3rd Edition|last=Woodhead, Partridge, Kawanami|first=Linda, Christopher, Hiroko|publisher=Routeledge|year=2016|isbn=978-0-415-85881-6|location=|pages=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;.An oft-quoted passage from the [[Bhagavad Gita]] describes the typical role of an avatar of Vishnu:&lt;ref name="Gale's" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Matchett" /&gt;
{{Quote|
&lt;poem&gt;
Whenever righteousness wanes and unrighteousness increases I send myself forth.
For the protection of the good and for the destruction of evil,
and for the establishment of righteousness,
I come into being age after age.
&lt;/poem&gt;
|Bhagavad Gita 4.7–8|
}}

The Vishnu avatars appear in Hindu mythology whenever the cosmos is in crisis, typically because the evil has grown stronger and has thrown the cosmos out of its balance.{{Sfn|James Lochtefeld|2002|p=228}} The avatar then appears in a material form, to destroy evil and its sources, and restore the cosmic balance between the ever-present forces of good and evil.{{Sfn|James Lochtefeld|2002|p=228}}

The most known and celebrated avatars of Vishnu, within the [[Vaishnavism]] traditions of Hinduism, are [[Krishna]], [[Rama]], [[Narayana]] and [[Vasudeva]]. These names have extensive literature associated with them, each has its own characteristics, legends and associated arts.&lt;ref name="Matchett" /&gt; The Mahabharata, for example, includes Krishna, while the Ramayana includes Rama.&lt;ref name="King"&gt;{{cite book|last=King|first=Anna S.|title=The intimate other: love divine in Indic religions|publisher=Orient Blackswan|year=2005|pages=32–33|isbn=978-81-250-2801-7|url=https://books.google.com/?id=0FvH1aCXETwC&amp;pg=PA32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dashavatara===
{{Main|Dashavatara}}

The [[Bhagavata Purana]] describes Vishnu's avatars as innumerable, though ten of his incarnations (''[[Dashavatara]]''), are celebrated therein as his major appearances.&lt;ref name="Bryant" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Matchett" /&gt;  The ten major Vishnu avatars are mentioned in the [[Agni Purana]], the [[Garuda Purana]] and the Bhagavata Purana;&lt;ref name="Mishra"&gt;{{cite book|last=Mishra|first=Vibhuti Bhushan|title=Religious beliefs and practices of North India during the early mediaeval period, Volume 1|publisher=BRILL|year=1973|pages=4–5|isbn=978-90-04-03610-9|url=https://books.google.com/?id=nAQ4AAAAIAAJ }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rukmani"&gt;{{cite book|last=Rukmani|first=T.

The ten best known avatars of Vishnu are collectively known as the ''Dasavatara'' (a [[Sanskrit compound]] meaning "ten avatars"). Five different lists are included in the Bhagavata Purana, where the difference is in the sequence of the names. Freda Matchett states that this re-sequencing by the composers may be intentional, so as to avoid implying priority or placing something definitive and limited to the abstract.{{Sfn|Matchett|2001|p=160}}

 | [[Matsya]]
 | Half narwhal-half man avatar. He saves the world from a cosmic deluge, with the help of a boat made of the [[Vedas]] (knowledge), on which he also rescues Manu (progenitor of man) and all living beings. Demon, Hayagriva steals and tries to destroy the Vedas, but Matsya finds the demon, kills him, and returns the Vedas.

 | Tortoise avatar. He supports the cosmos, while the gods and demons churn the cosmic ocean with the help of serpent Vasuki to produce the nectar of immortality (just like churning milk to produce butter). The churning produces both the good and the bad, including poison and immortality nectar. Nobody wants the poison, everyone wants the immortality nectar. The demons attempt to steal the nectar, wherein Vishnu appears as enchantress Mohini avatar, for whom they all fall, and give her the nectar.

 | [[Narasimha]]
 | Half lion-half man avatar. Demon king Hiranyakashipu becomes enormously powerful, gains special powers by which no man or animal could kill him, then bullies and persecutes people who disagree with him, including his own son. The Man-Lion avatar creatively defeats those special powers, kills Hiranyakashipu, and rescues demon's son [[Prahlada]] who opposes his own father. The legend is a part of the Hindu festival [[Holi]] folklore.

 | [[Vamana]]
 | Dwarf avatar. Demon king Bali gains disproportionately enormous powers, ruling the entire universe and abusing it. The dwarf avatar approaches Bali in the form of a monk, when Bali is trying to show off by giving alms at a sacrifice. Bali offers the dwarf any riches he wants, the monk refuses and asks for three steps of land. Bali grants it to him. The dwarf grows, in his first step takes the earth, the second all of the heavens, and for the third the netherworld where Bali returns to.

Avatars like [[Hayagriva]], Hamsa and [[Garuda]] are also mentioned in the [[Pañcaratra]] making the total of thirty-nine avatars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schrader|first=Friedrich Otto |title=Introduction to the Pāñcarātra and the Ahirbudhnya saṃhitā|publisher=Adyar Library|year=1916|page=42|url=https://books.google.com/?id=OlgLAQAAIAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, despite these lists, the commonly accepted number of ten avatars for Vishnu was fixed well before the 10th century CE.&lt;ref name="Mishra" /&gt;

===Types===
[[File:Mohini in Belur temple.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|[[Mohini]], the female avatar of Vishnu (statue at [[Belur, Karnataka|Belur]] temple, Karnataka.)]]
The ''avatar'' concept was further developed and refined in later Hindu texts. One approach was to identify full avatar and partial avatars; Krishna, Rama and Narasimha were full avatars (''purna avatars''), while others were partial avatars (''ansha avatars'').{{Sfn|Sheth|2002|p=99}} Some declared, states Noel Sheth, that every living creature is an ''avatar'' of Vishnu.{{Sfn|Sheth|2002|p=99}} The [[Pancharatra]] text of Vaishnavism declares that Vishnu's avatar include those that are direct and complete (''sakshad''), indirect and endowed (''avesha''), cosmic and salvific (''vyuha''), inner and inspirational (''antaryamin''), consecrated and in the form of image (''archa'').{{Sfn|Sheth|2002|p=99}}

Yet another classification, developed in Krishna schools, centers around ''Guna-avatars'', ''Purusha-avatars'' and ''Lila-avatars'', with their subtypes.{{Sfn|Sheth|2002|p=100}}&lt;ref name="Holdrege2015p50"&gt;{{cite book|author=Barbara A.

==Avatars of Ganesha==
The [[Linga Purana]] declares that Ganesha incarnates to destroy demons and to help the gods and pious people.&lt;ref name="Grimes"&gt;{{cite book|last=Grimes|first=John A.|title=Gaṇapati: song of the self|publisher=[[SUNY Press]]|year=1995|page=105|isbn=978-0-7914-2439-1|url=https://books.google.com/?id=aoqB4n95pSoC&amp;pg=PT105}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two [[upapurana]]s&amp;nbsp;– [[Ganesha Purana]] and [[Mudgala Purana]]&amp;nbsp;– detail the avatars of Ganesha. Both these upapuranas are core scriptures of the [[Ganapatya]] sect&amp;nbsp;– exclusively dedicated to Ganesha worship.

Four avatars of Ganesha are listed in the Ganesha Purana: Mohotkata, Mayūreśvara, Gajanana and Dhumraketu. Each avatar corresponds to a different yuga, has a different mount and different skin complexion, but all the avatars have a common purpose&amp;nbsp;– to slay demons.&lt;ref&gt;Grimes, pp. 100–105.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mudgala Purana describes eight avatars of Ganesha:&lt;ref name=Granoff&gt;Phyllis Granoff, "{{IAST|Gaṇeśa as Metaphor}}," in Robert L. Brown (ed.) Ganesh: Studies of an Asian God, pp. 94–5, note 2. {{ISBN|0-7914-0657-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Vakratunda ({{IAST|Vakratuṇḍa}}) ("twisting trunk"), his mount is a lion.
#Ekadanta ("single tusk"), his mount is a mouse.
#Mahodara ("big belly"), his mount is a mouse.
#Gajavaktra (or Gajānana) ("elephant face"), his mount is a mouse.
#Lambodara ("pendulous belly"), his mount is a mouse.
#Vikata ({{IAST|Vikaṭa}}) ("unusual form", "misshapen"), his mount is a peacock.
#Vighnaraja ({{IAST|Vighnarāja}}) ("king of obstacles"), his mount is the celestial serpent {{IAST|Śeṣa}}.
#Dhumravarna ({{IAST|Dhūmravarṇa}}) ("grey color") corresponds to Śiva, his mount is a horse.

Avatars are also observed in [[Shaktism]], the sect dedicated to the worship of the Goddess ([[Devi]]), but they do not have universal acceptance in the sect.

'''Behavior modification''' refers to [[behavioral change theories|behavior-change procedures]] that were employed during the 1970s and early 1980s. Based on methodological behaviorism,&lt;ref name=Annualreviewbehaviortherapy&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Behavior modification: delusion or deliverance?|author=Mahoney, M. J., Kazdin, A.

[[Applied behavior analysis]] (ABA)&amp;mdash;the application of behavior analysis&amp;mdash;is based on [[radical behaviorism]], which refers to [[B. F. Skinner]]'s viewpoint that cognition and emotions are covert behavior that are to be subjected to the same conditions as overt behavior.

==Description==
The first use of the term behavior modification appears to have been by [[Edward Thorndike]] in 1911. His article ''Provisional Laws of Acquired Behavior or Learning'' makes frequent use of the term "modifying behavior".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Thorndike |first=E.L. |year=1911 |title=Provisional Laws of Acquired Behavior or Learning |journal=Animal Intelligence |publisher=The McMillian Company |location=New York }}&lt;/ref&gt; Through early research in the 1940s and the 1950s the term was used by [[Joseph Wolpe]]'s research group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wolpe |first=J. |year=1968 |title=Psychotheraphy by Reciprocal Inhibition |journal=Conditional Reflex |volume=3 |issue=4 |pages=234–240 |doi=10.1007/BF03000093 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The experimental tradition in clinical psychology used it to refer to psycho-therapeutic techniques derived from empirical research.&lt;ref&gt;In {{cite book |editor-first=A. J. |editor-last=Bachrach |title=Experimental Foundations of Clinical Psychology |pages=3–25 |location=New York |publisher=Basic Books |year=1962 |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has since come to refer mainly to techniques for increasing adaptive behavior through reinforcement and decreasing maladaptive behavior through extinction or punishment (with emphasis on the former).

In recent years, the concept of [[punishment (psychology)|punishment]] has had many critics, though these criticisms tend not to apply to negative punishment (time-outs) and usually apply to the addition of some aversive event. The use of [[positive punishment]] by board certified behavior analysts is restricted to extreme circumstances when all other forms of treatment have failed and when the behavior to be modified is a danger to the person or to others (see [[professional practice of behavior analysis]]). In clinical settings positive punishment is usually restricted to using a spray bottle filled with water as an aversive event. When misused, more aversive punishment can lead to affective (emotional) disorders, as well as to the receiver of the punishment increasingly trying to avoid the punishment (i.e., "not get caught").

Behavior modification relies on the following:
* [[Reinforcement]] (Positive and Negative)
* [[Punishment (psychology)|Punishment]] (Positive and Negative)
* [[Extinction (psychology)|Extinction]]
* [[Shaping (psychology)|Shaping]]
* [[Applied behavior analysis#Fading|Fading]]
* [[Chaining]]

==Some areas of effectiveness==
[[Functional analysis (psychology)|Functional behavior assessment]] forms the core of [[applied behavior analysis]]. Many techniques in this therapy are specific techniques aimed at specific issues. Interventions based on behavior analytic principles have been extremely effective in developing evidence-based treatments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=O'Donohue |first=W. |last2=Ferguson |first2=K. E. |year=2006 |title=Evidence-Based Practice in Psychology and Behavior Analysis |journal=The Behavior Analyst Today |volume=7 |issue=3 |pages=335–52 |doi=10.1037/h0100155 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the above, a growing list of research-based interventions from the behavioral paradigm exist. With children with [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]] (ADHD), one study showed that over a several year period, children in the behavior modification group had half the number of felony arrests as children in the medication group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Satterfield |first=J. H. |last2=Satterfield |first2=B. T. |last3=Schell |first3=A. M. |year=1987 |title=Therapeutic interventions to prevent delinquency in hyperactive boys |journal=Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry |volume=26 |issue=1 |pages=56–64 |doi=10.1097/00004583-198701000-00012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Satterfield |first=J. H. |last2=Schell |first2=A. |year=1997 |title=A prospective study of hyperactive boys with conduct problems and normal boys: Adolescent and adult criminality |journal=Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry |volume=36 |issue=12 |pages=1726–35 |doi=10.1097/00004583-199712000-00021 |pmid=9401334}}&lt;/ref&gt; These findings have yet to be replicated, but are considered encouraging for the use of behavior modification for children with ADHD. There is strong and consistent evidence that behavioral treatments are effective for treating ADHD. A recent [[meta-analysis]] found that the use of behavior modification for ADHD resulted in effect sizes in between group studies (.83), pre-post studies (.70), within group studies (2.64), and single subject studies (3.78) indicating behavioral treatments are highly effective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Fabianoa |first=G. A. |last2=Pelham Jr. |first2=W. E. |last3=Colesb |first3=E. K. |last4=Gnagya |first4=E. M. |last5=Chronis-Tuscanoc |first5=A. |last6=O'Connora |first6=B. C. |year=2008 |title=A meta-analysis of behavioral treatments for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder |journal=Clinical Psychology Review |volume=29 |issue=2 |pages=129–40 |doi=10.1016/j.cpr.2008.11.001 |pmid=19131150}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Behavior modification programs form the core of many residential [[Behavior Modification Facility|treatment facility]] programs. They have shown success in reducing recidivism for adolescents with conduct problems and adult offenders. One particular program that is of interest is ''teaching-family homes'' (see [[Teaching Family Model]]), which is based on a social learning model that emerged from [[radical behaviorism]]. These particular homes use a family style approach to residential treatment, which has been carefully replicated over 700 times.&lt;ref&gt;Dean L. Fixsen, Karen A. Blasé, Gary D. Timbers and Montrose M. Wolf (2007) In Search of Program Implementation: 792 Replications of the Teaching-Family Model. ''Behavior Analyst Today'' Volume 8, No. 1, pp. 96–106 [http://www.baojournal.com Behavior Analyst Online]&lt;/ref&gt; Recent efforts have seen a push for the inclusion of more behavior modification programs in residential re-entry programs in the U.S. to aid prisoners in re-adjusting after release.

One area that has repeatedly shown effectiveness has been the work of [[behaviorist]]s working in the area of community reinforcement for addictions.&lt;ref&gt;Milford, J.L.; Austin, J.L.; Smith, J.E. (2007). Community Reinforcement and the Dissemination of Evidence-based Practice: Implications for Public Policy. ''IJBCT'', 3(1), pp. 77–87 [http://www.baojournal.com])&lt;/ref&gt; Another area of research that has been strongly supported has been behavioral activation for depression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Spates | first1 = R.C. | last2 = Pagoto | first2 = S. | last3 = Kalata | first3 = A. | year = 2006 | title = A Qualitative and Quantitative Review of Behavioral Activation Treatment of Major Depressive Disorder | url = http://www.baojournal.com | journal = The Behavior Analyst Today | volume = 7 | issue = 4| pages = 508–17 | doi=10.1037/h0100089}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One way of giving positive reinforcement in behavior modification is in providing compliments, approval, encouragement, and affirmation; a ratio of five compliments for every one complaint is generally seen as being [[effective]] in altering behavior in a desired manner&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kirkhart |first=Robert |last2=Kirkhart |first2=Evelyn |chapter=The Bruised Self: Mending in the Early Years |editor-first=Kaoru |editor-last=Yamamoto |title=The Child and His Image: Self Concept in the Early Years |location=New York |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |year=1972 |isbn=0-395-12571-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and even in producing stable marriages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gottman | first1 = J.M. | last2 = Levenson | first2 = R.W. | year = 1999 | title = What predicts change in marital interaction over time? A study of alternative models | url = | journal = Family Process | volume = 38 | issue = 2| pages = 143–58 | doi=10.1111/j.1545-5300.1999.00143.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of notable interest is that the right behavioral intervention can have profound system effects. For example, Forgatch and DeGarmo (2007) found that with mothers who were recently divorced, a standard round of [[parent management training]] (programs based on social learning principles that teaches rewarding good behavior and ignoring bad behavior combined with communication skills) could help elevate the divorced mother out of poverty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Forgatch | first1 = M. | last2 = DeGarmo | first2 =  | year = 2007 | title = Accelerating recovery from poverty: Prevention effects for recently separated mothers | url = | journal = Journal of Early and Intensive Behavior Intervention | volume = 4 | issue = 4| pages = 681–72 | doi=10.1037/h0100400| pmc = 2587348}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, parent management training programs, sometimes referred to as behavioral parent training programs, have shown relative cost effectiveness for their efforts&lt;ref&gt;Olchowski, A.E.; Foster, E.M.; Webster-Stratton, C.H. (2007). Implementing Behavioral Intervention Components in a Cost-Effective Manner: Analysis of the Incredible Years Program. ''Journal of Early and Intensive Behavior Intervention'', Vol. 3(4) and Vol. 4(1), Combined Edition, pp. 284–304.&lt;/ref&gt; for the treatment of conduct disorder. Thus, such intervention can have profound effects on socializing the child in a relatively cost effective fashion and help get the parent out of poverty. This level of effect is often looked for and valued by those who practice [[behavioral engineering]] and results of this type have caused the Association for Behavior Analysis International to take a position that those receiving treatment have a right to effective treatment &lt;ref&gt;[https://apps.abainternational.org/ABA/statements/treatment.asp ABA:I] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081119000000/https://apps.abainternational.org/ABA/statements/treatment.asp |date=November 19, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a right to effective education.&lt;ref&gt;[https://apps.abainternational.org/ABA/statements/education.asp ABA:I]&lt;/ref&gt;

==In job performance==
Based on the conceptual premises of classical behaviorism and reinforcement theory, the Organizational Behavior Modification Model (aka O.B. Mod) represents a behavioral approach to the management of human resources in organizational settings.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stajkovic, A. D., &amp; Luthans, F.|first=|date=1997|title=A meta-analysis of the effects of organizational behavior modification on task performance, 1975-1995|url=|journal=Academy of Management|volume=40|pages=1122–1149|via=|doi=10.2307/256929}}&lt;/ref&gt; The application of reinforcement theory to modification of behavior as it relates to job performance first requires analysis of necessary antecedents (e.g., job design, training) of the desired behavior.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; After it has been determined that the necessary antecedents are present, managers must first identify the behaviors to change. These behaviors must be observable, measurable, task-related, and critical to the task at hand. Next, a baseline measure of the behavior must be assessed and functional consequences analyzed.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Now that the link between the antecedent, behavior, and contingent consequences has been established, an intervention to change the behavior can be introduced. If the intervention is successful in modifying the behavior, it must be maintained using schedules of reinforcement and must be evaluated for performance improvement.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The O.B. Mod has been found to have a significant positive effect on task performance globally,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Luthans, F., Stajkovic, A. D., Luthans, B. C., &amp; Lutherans, K. W.|first=|date=1998|title=Applying Behavioral Management in Eastern Europe|url=|journal=European Management Journal|volume=16|pages=446–475|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; with performance on average increasing 17%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Luthans, F., &amp; Stajkovic, A. D.|first=|date=1999|title=Reinforce for performance: The need to go beyond pay and even rewards|url=|journal=Academy of Management Executive|volume=13|pages=49–57|via=|doi=10.5465/ame.1999.1899548}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study that examined the differential effects of incentive motivators administered with the O.B. Mod on job performance found that using money as a reinforcer with O.B. Mod was more successful at increasing performance compared to routine pay for performance (i.e., money administered on performance not using O.B. Mod).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stajkovic, A. D., &amp; Luthans, F.|first=|date=2001|title=Differential effects of incentive motivators on work performance|url=|journal=Academy of Management Journal|volume=4|pages=580–590|via=|doi=10.2307/3069372}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors also found that using money administered through the O.B. Mod produced stronger effects (37% performance increase), compared to social recognition (24% performance increase) and performance feedback (20% performance increase).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Criticism&lt;!--This section is linked from other articles: do not rename without including an anchor to previous name ([[MOS:HEAD]])--&gt;==
{{See also|Cognitive behavioral therapy#Criticisms|Psychotherapy#General critiques}}
Behavior modification is critiqued in person-centered psychotherapeutic approaches such as [[Person-centered therapy|Rogerian Counseling]] and [[Re-evaluation Counseling]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rc.org/|title=Re-evaluation Counseling|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which involve "connecting with the human qualities of the person to promote healing", while behaviorism is "denigrating to the human spirit".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Holland | first1 = J.L. | year = 1976 | title = A new synthesis for an old method and a new analysis of some old phenomena | url = | journal = The Counseling Psychologist | volume = 6 | issue = | pages = 12–15 | doi=10.1177/001100007600600303}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[B.F. Skinner]] argues in ''[[Beyond Freedom and Dignity]]'' that unrestricted reinforcement is what led to the "feeling of freedom", thus removal of aversive events allows people to "feel freer".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=B. F. |last=Skinner |year=1974 |title=Beyond Freedom and Dignity |location=Harmondsworth |publisher=Penguin |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Further criticism extends to the presumption that behavior increases only when it is reinforced. This premise is at odds with research conducted by [[Albert Bandura]] at Stanford University. His findings indicate that violent behavior is imitated, without being reinforced, in studies conducted with children watching films showing various individuals "beating the daylights out of Bobo". Bandura believes that human personality and learning is the result of the interaction between environment, behavior and psychological process. There is evidence, however, that imitation is a class of behavior that can be learned just like anything else. Children have been shown to imitate behavior that they have never displayed before and are never reinforced for, after being taught to imitate in general.&lt;ref&gt;D. Baer, R.F.; Peterson, J.A. Sherman Psychological Modeling: Conflicting Theories, 2006{{Incomplete short citation|date=February 2015}} &lt;!-- Is it ISBN 0202308480 ? --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Several people have criticized the level of training required to perform behavior modification procedures, especially those that are restrictive or use [[aversives]], [[aversion therapy]], or [[punishment]] protocols. Some desire to limit such restrictive procedures only to licensed psychologists or licensed counselors. Once licensed for this group, post-licensed certification in behavior modification is sought to show scope of competence in the area through groups like the World Association for Behavior Analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.baojournal.com/WCBA/WCBA.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-01-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110110222511/http://www.baojournal.com/WCBA/WCBA.html |archivedate=2011-01-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Still others desire to create an independent practice of behavior analysis through licensure to offer consumers choices between proven techniques and unproven ones (see [[Professional practice of behavior analysis]]). Level of training and consumer protection remain of critical importance in [[applied behavior analysis]] and behavior modification.

Examples of biotic materials are [[wood]], [[straw]], [[humus]], [[manure]], [[Bark (botany)|bark]], [[crude oil]], [[cotton]], [[spider silk]], [[chitin]], [[fibrin]], and [[bone]].

The use of biotic materials, and processed biotic materials ([[bio-based material]]) as [[alternative natural materials]], over synthetics is popular with those who are environmentally conscious because such materials are usually biodegradable, renewable, and the processing is commonly understood and has minimal environmental impact. However, not all biotic materials are used in an environmentally friendly way, such as those that require high levels of processing, are harvested unsustainably, or are used to produce [[greenhouse gasses|carbon emission]]s.

When the source of the recently living material has little importance to the product produced, such as in the production of [[biofuel]]s, biotic material is simply called [[biomass]]. Many fuel sources may have biological sources, and may be divided roughly into [[fossil fuels]], and [[biofuel]].

In [[soil science]], biotic material is often referred to as ''[[organic matter]]''. Biotic materials in [[soil]] include [[glomalin]], [[Dopplerite]] and [[humic acid]].  Some biotic material may not be considered to be organic matter if it is low in [[organic compounds]], such as a clam's shell, which is an essential component of the living organism, but contains little organic carbon.

Examples of the use of biotic materials include:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7560">In [[mathematics]], '''categorification''' is the process of replacing [[set theory|set-theoretic]] [[theorem]]s by [[category theory|category-theoretic]] analogues. Categorification, when done successfully, replaces [[set (mathematics)|set]]s by [[category (category theory)|categories]], [[function (mathematics)|function]]s with [[functor]]s, and [[equation]]s by [[natural transformation|natural isomorphisms]] of functors satisfying additional properties.  The term was coined by [[Louis Crane]].

The reverse of categorification is the process of ''decategorification''. Decategorification is a systematic process by which [[morphism|isomorphic]] objects in a category are identified as [[equality (mathematics)|equal]]. Whereas decategorification is a straightforward process, categorification is usually much less straightforward, and requires insight into individual situations.

The word (de)categorification doesn't refer to a precise mathematical procedure, but rather to a class of possible analogues. It's used in a similar way to the words like '[[generalization]]', and not like '[[sheafification]]'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://mathoverflow.net/a/4880/38821 | title = What precisely Is “Categorification”? | author = Alex Hoffnung | date = 2009-11-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes, the context of an object suggests a natural direction for a categorification of it. For example, in [[representation theory]] of [[Lie algebra]]s mathematicians study [[module over a ring|modules]] over some specific algebras. In this case, there are several frameworks for what exactly a categorification of such a module should be, e.g., so called (weak) abelian categorifications, discussed later in the article.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first1=Mikhail|last1=Khovanov|author1-link=Mikhail Khovanov|first2=Volodymyr|last2=Mazorchuk|first3=Catharina|last3=Stroppel|author3-link= Catharina Stroppel |arxiv=math.RT/0702746 |title=A brief review of abelian categorifications|journal=Theory Appl. Categ.|volume=22|number=19|year=2009|pages=479–508}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples of categorification==
One form of categorification takes a structure described in terms of sets, and interprets the sets as ''isomorphism classes'' of objects in a category.  For example, the set of [[Natural number|natural numbers]] can be seen as the set of ''cardinalities'' of finite sets (and any two sets with the same cardinality are isomorphic).  In this case, operations on the set of natural numbers, such as addition and multiplication, can be seen as carrying information about [[Product (category theory)|products]] and [[Coproduct|coproducts]] of the [[category of finite sets]].  Less abstractly, the idea here is that manipulating sets of actual objects, and taking coproducts (combining two sets in a union) or products (building arrays of things to keep track of large numbers of them) came first.  Later, the concrete structure of sets was abstracted away – taken "only up to isomorphism", to produce the abstract theory of arithmetic.  This is a "decategorification" – categorification reverses this step.

Other examples include [[homology theory|homology theories]] in [[topology]]. [[Emmy Noether]] gave the modern formulation of homology as the [[Rank of a group|rank]] of certain [[Free abelian group|free abelian groups]] by categorifying the notion of a [[Betti number]].{{sfn|Baez|1998}} See also [[Khovanov homology]] as a [[knot invariant]] in [[knot theory]].

An example in finite group theory is that the [[ring of symmetric functions]] is categorified by the category of representations of the [[symmetric group]]. The decategorification map sends the [[Specht module]] indexed by partition &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; to the [[schur class|schur function]] indexed by the same partition:

&lt;math&gt;S^\lambda \stackrel{\varphi}{\to} s_\lambda,&lt;/math&gt;

(essentially following the [[Character (mathematics)|character]] map from a favorite basis of the associated [[Grothendieck group]] to a representation-theoretic favorite basis of the ring of [[symmetric functions]]). This map reflects much of the parallels in structure; for example

&lt;math&gt;[\mathrm{Ind}_{S_m \otimes S_n}^{S_{n+m}}(S^{\mu} \otimes S^{\nu})] \qquad \text{ and } \qquad s_\mu s_\nu &lt;/math&gt;

have the same decomposition numbers over their respective bases, both given by [[Littlewood–Richardson rule|Littlewood-Richardson coefficients]].

==Abelian categorifications==
For a category &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{B}&lt;/math&gt;, let &lt;math&gt;K(\mathcal{B})&lt;/math&gt; be the [[Grothendieck group]] of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{B}&lt;/math&gt;.

Let &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; be a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] which is [[Free abelian group|free as an abelian group]], and let &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a} = \{a_i\}_{i \in I}&lt;/math&gt; be a basis of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; such that the multiplication is positive in &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}&lt;/math&gt;, i.e.

 &lt;math&gt;a_i a_j = \sum_{k} c_{ij}^k a_k,&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt; c_{ij}^k \in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}.&lt;/math&gt;

Let &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; be an &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;-[[Module (mathematics)|module]]. Then a (weak) abelian categorification of &lt;math&gt;(A, \mathbf{a}, B)&lt;/math&gt; consists of an [[abelian category]] &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{B}&lt;/math&gt;, an isomorphism &lt;math&gt; \phi: K(\mathcal{B}) \to B&lt;/math&gt;, and exact endofunctors &lt;math&gt;F_i: \mathcal{B} \to \mathcal{B}&lt;/math&gt; such that

# the functor &lt;math&gt;F_i&lt;/math&gt; lifts the action of &lt;math&gt;a_i&lt;/math&gt; on the module &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. &lt;math&gt;\phi [F_i] = a_i \phi&lt;/math&gt;, and
# there are isomorphisms &lt;math&gt;F_i F_j \cong \bigoplus_{k} F_k^{c_{ij}^k},&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. the composition &lt;math&gt;F_i F_j&lt;/math&gt; decomposes as the direct sum of functors &lt;math&gt;F_k&lt;/math&gt; in the same way that the product &lt;math&gt;a_i a_j&lt;/math&gt; decomposes as the linear combination of basis elements &lt;math&gt;a_k&lt;/math&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3819">'''Citizen diplomacy''' (people's diplomacy) is the political concept of average citizens engaging as representatives of a country or cause either inadvertently or by design.&lt;ref name="usstateyouarea"&gt;{{cite web|title=You Are A Citizen Diplomat|url=http://diplomacy.state.gov/discoverdiplomacy/references/169794.htm|website=United States Department of State|accessdate=August 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Citizen diplomacy may take place when official channels are not reliable or desirable; for instance, if two countries do not formally recognize each other's governments, citizen diplomacy may be an ideal tool of statecraft. Citizen diplomacy does not have to be direct negotiations between two parties, but can take the form of: scientific exchanges, cultural exchanges, and international athletic events.

Citizen diplomacy can complement official diplomacy or subvert it. Some nations ban track-two efforts like this when they run counter to official foreign policy.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Citizen Diplomacy is the concept that the individual has the right, even the responsibility, to help shape U.S. foreign relations, "one handshake at a time." Citizen diplomats can be students, teachers, athletes, artists, business people, humanitarians, adventurers or tourists. They are motivated by a responsibility to engage with the rest of the world in a meaningful, mutually beneficial dialogue.&lt;ref name="U.S. Center for Citizen Diplomacy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uscenterforcitizendiplomacy.org/|title=U.S. Center for Citizen Diplomacy|accessdate=2008-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

One of the pioneers of citizen diplomacy, physicist [[Robert W. Fuller]], traveled frequently to the [[Soviet Union]] in the 1970s and 1980s in the effort to alleviate the [[Cold War]]. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, Fuller continued this work in political hot spots around the world and developed the idea of reducing [[rankism]] to promote peace. The phrase "citizen diplomacy" was first coined by [[David M. Hoffman]] in an article about Fuller's work which appeared in ''[[Co-Evolution Quarterly]]'' in 1981.{{cn|date=December 2017}}  [[Anti-nuclear]] groups like [[Clamshell Alliance]] and ECOLOGIA have sought to thwart US policy through "grassroots" initiatives with Soviet and (later) former Soviet groups.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6083">In [[topology]], a branch of mathematics, the '''clutching construction''' is a way of constructing fiber bundles, particularly vector bundles on spheres.

==Definition==
Consider the sphere &lt;math&gt;S^n&lt;/math&gt; as the union of the upper and lower hemispheres &lt;math&gt;D^n_+&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;D^n_-&lt;/math&gt; along their intersection, the equator, an &lt;math&gt;S^{n-1}&lt;/math&gt;.

Given trivialized [[fiber bundle]]s with fiber &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; and structure group &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; over the two disks, then given a map &lt;math&gt;f\colon S^{n-1} \to G&lt;/math&gt; (called the ''clutching map''), glue the two trivial bundles together via ''f''.

Formally, it is the [[coequalizer]] of the inclusions &lt;math&gt;S^{n-1} \times F \to D^n_+ \times F \coprod D^n_- \times F&lt;/math&gt; via &lt;math&gt;(x,v) \mapsto (x,v) \in D^n_+ \times F&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(x,v) \mapsto (x,f(x)(v)) \in D^n_- \times F&lt;/math&gt;: glue the two bundles together on the boundary, with a twist.

Thus we have a map &lt;math&gt;\pi_{n-1} G \to \text{Fib}_F(S^n)&lt;/math&gt;: clutching information on the equator yields a fiber bundle on the total space.

In the case of vector bundles, this yields &lt;math&gt;\pi_{n-1} O(k) \to \text{Vect}_k(S^n)&lt;/math&gt;, and indeed this map is an isomorphism (under connect sum of spheres on the right).

===Generalization===
The above can be generalized by replacing the disks and sphere with any closed triad &lt;math&gt;(X;A,B)&lt;/math&gt;, that is, a space ''X'', together with two closed subsets ''A'' and ''B'' whose union is ''X''. Then a clutching map on &lt;math&gt;A \cap B&lt;/math&gt; gives a vector bundle on ''X''.

===Classifying map construction===

Let &lt;math&gt;p \colon M \to N&lt;/math&gt; be a fibre bundle with fibre &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal U&lt;/math&gt; be a collection of pairs &lt;math&gt;(U_i,q_i)&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;q_i \colon p^{-1}(U_i) \to N \times F&lt;/math&gt; is a local trivialization of &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; over &lt;math&gt;U_i \subset N&lt;/math&gt;. Moreover, we demand that the union of all the sets &lt;math&gt;U_i&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; (i.e. the collection is an atlas of trivializations &lt;math&gt;\coprod_i U_i = N&lt;/math&gt;). 

Consider the space &lt;math&gt;\coprod_i U_i\times F&lt;/math&gt; modulo the equivalence relation &lt;math&gt;(u_i,f_i)\in U_i \times F&lt;/math&gt; is equivalent to &lt;math&gt;(u_j,f_j)\in U_j \times F&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;U_i \cap U_j \neq \phi&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;q_i \circ q_j^{-1}(u_j,f_j) = (u_i,f_i)&lt;/math&gt;. By design, the local trivializations &lt;math&gt;q_i&lt;/math&gt; give a fibrewise equivalence between this quotient space and the fibre bundle &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;.

Consider the space &lt;math&gt;\coprod_i U_i\times \operatorname{Homeo}(F)&lt;/math&gt; modulo the equivalence relation &lt;math&gt;(u_i,h_i)\in U_i \times \operatorname{Homeo}(F)&lt;/math&gt; is equivalent to &lt;math&gt;(u_j,h_j)\in U_j \times \operatorname{Homeo}(F)&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;U_i \cap U_j \neq \phi&lt;/math&gt; and consider &lt;math&gt;q_i \circ q_j^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; to be a map &lt;math&gt;q_i \circ q_j^{-1} : U_i \cap U_j \to \operatorname{Homeo}(F)&lt;/math&gt; then we demand that &lt;math&gt;q_i \circ q_j^{-1}(u_j)(h_j)=h_i&lt;/math&gt;.  That is, in our re-construction of &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; we are replacing the fibre &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; by the topological group of homeomorphisms of the fibre, &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Homeo}(F)&lt;/math&gt;. If the structure group of the bundle is known to reduce, you could replace &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Homeo}(F)&lt;/math&gt; with the reduced structure group.  This is a bundle over &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; with fibre &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Homeo}(F)&lt;/math&gt; and is a principal bundle.  Denote it by &lt;math&gt;p \colon M_p \to N&lt;/math&gt;. The relation to the previous bundle is induced from the principal bundle: &lt;math&gt;(M_p \times F)/\operatorname{Homeo}(F) = M&lt;/math&gt;. 

So we have a principal bundle &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Homeo}(F) \to M_p \to N&lt;/math&gt;. The theory of classifying spaces gives us an induced '''push-forward''' fibration &lt;math&gt;M_p \to N \to B(\operatorname{Homeo}(F))&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;B(Homeo(F))&lt;/math&gt; is the classifying space of &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Homeo}(F)&lt;/math&gt;. Here is an outline:

Given a &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;-principal bundle &lt;math&gt;G \to M_p \to N&lt;/math&gt;, consider the space &lt;math&gt;M_p \times_{G} EG&lt;/math&gt;.  This space is a fibration in two different ways:

1) Project onto the first factor: &lt;math&gt;M_p \times_G EG \to M_p/G = N&lt;/math&gt;. The fibre in this case is &lt;math&gt;EG&lt;/math&gt;, which is a contractible space by the definition of a classifying space. 

2) Project onto the second factor: &lt;math&gt;M_p \times_G EG \to EG/G = BG&lt;/math&gt;.  The fibre in this case is &lt;math&gt;M_p&lt;/math&gt;. 

Thus we have a fibration &lt;math&gt;M_p \to N \simeq M_p\times_G EG \to BG&lt;/math&gt;.  This map is called the '''classifying map''' of the fibre bundle &lt;math&gt;p \colon M \to N&lt;/math&gt; since 1) the principal bundle &lt;math&gt;G \to M_p \to N&lt;/math&gt; is the pull-back of the bundle &lt;math&gt;G \to EG \to BG&lt;/math&gt; along the classifying map and 2) The bundle &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is induced from the principal bundle as above.

===Contrast with twisted spheres===
{{see also|Twisted sphere}}
[[Twisted sphere]]s are sometimes referred to as a "clutching-type" construction, but this is misleading: the clutching construction is properly about fiber bundles.

* In twisted spheres, you glue two ''disks'' along their boundary. The disks are ''a priori'' identified (with the standard disk), and points on the boundary sphere do not in general go to their corresponding points on the other boundary sphere. This is a map &lt;math&gt;S^{n-1} \to S^{n-1}&lt;/math&gt;: the gluing is non-trivial in the base.
* In the clutching construction, you glue two ''bundles'' together over the boundary of their base disks. The boundary spheres are glued together via the standard identification: each point goes to the corresponding one, but each fiber has a twist. This is a map &lt;math&gt;S^{n-1} \to G&lt;/math&gt;: the gluing is trivial in the base, but not in the fibers.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19818">'''Coitus reservatus''' (''[[Sexual intercourse|coitus]]'', "sexual intercourse, union" + ''reservatus'', "reserved, saved"),&lt;ref&gt;Cassell's ''Compact Latin Dictionary'', Dell Publishing Co. Inc., 1963&lt;/ref&gt; also known as '''sexual continence''', is a form of sexual intercourse in which the penetrative partner does not attempt to [[Ejaculation|ejaculate]] within the receptive partner, but instead attempts to remain at the [[Human sexual response cycle#Plateau phase|plateau phase]] of intercourse for as long as possible avoiding the seminal emission.

[[Alice Stockham]] coined the term ''karezza'', derived from the Italian word "carezza" meaning "caress", to describe coitus reservatus, but the idea was already in practice at the [[Oneida Community]]. [[Alan Watts]] believed, in error, that karezza was a Persian word.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Watts |first=Alan W. |title=Nature, Man and Woman |page=172 |year=1970 |publisher=Random House Inc. Vintage Books Edition |lccn=58-8266 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of karezza is loosely akin to [[maithuna]] in [[Tantra|Hindu Tantra]] and [[Sahaja]] in Hindu [[Yoga]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Coomaraswami |first=Ananda K.|title=The Dance of Shiva |page=124 |publisher=The Noonday Press Inc. |year=1957 |location=New York City |lccn=56-12296}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Control of ejaculation is a key aspect of [[Taoist sexual practices]] (known as "cai Yin pu Yang" and "cai Yang pu Yin").&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www2.hu-berlin.de/sexology/GESUND/ARCHIV/SEN/CH23.HTM|title=Human Sexuality: An Encyclopedia: T|last=Pauly|first=Ira B.|date=2013-05-23|website=|publisher=Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130523194332/http://www2.hu-berlin.de/sexology/GESUND/ARCHIV/SEN/CH23.HTM|archive-date=2013-05-23|dead-url=yes|access-date=2017-06-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Practice of Karezza and Tantric (sexual) continence ==

Stockham writes, "... Karezza signifies 'to express affection in both words and action,' and while it fittingly denotes the union that is the outcome of deepest human affection, love's consummation, it is used technically throughout this work to designate a controlled sexual union." So that in practice, according to Stockham, it is more than just self-control, but mutual control where the penetrative partner helps the receptive partner and vice versa. According to Stockham this is the key to overcoming many difficulties encountered in trying to control sexual expression on an individual basis.{{sfn |Stockham |1896 |p=22}}
Stockham's contribution was to apply this same philosophy of [[Edging (sexual practice)|orgasm control]] to women as much as to men. A form of [[birth control]], the technique also prolongs sexual pleasure to the point of achieving mystical ecstasy, according to [[John William Lloyd|J. William Lloyd]], a practitioner of Karezza, whose own experience of [[cosmic consciousness]] appears in  ''Cosmic Consciousness'', a book written  by the Canadian psychiatrist [[Richard Maurice Bucke|Richard M. Bucke]], a friend of the American poet [[Walt Whitman]].&lt;ref&gt;Bucke, Richard Maurice, M. D. ''Cosmic Consciousness'', p. 284, Citadel Press, 1961, {{ISBN|0-8065-0211-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this practice,  orgasm is separated from ejaculation, making possible enjoyment of the pleasure of sexual intercourse without experiencing seminal ejaculation, while still experiencing orgasm.

Some would have the principles of karezza applied to masturbation, whereby a person attempts to delay orgasm as long as possible to prolong pleasure in a process known as "orgasmic brinkmanship", "surfing", or "edging" but this is different from the heterosexual practice of "karezza".&lt;ref&gt;Ruth Marie Griffith ''Born Again Bodies'', p. 92, [[University of California Press]], 2004 {{ISBN|978-0-520-24240-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Latin literature, this is known as ''coitus sine ejaculatione seminis''.&lt;ref&gt;Lloyd, J. William ''The Karezza Method'' Health Research, 1964, Mokelumne Hill, California&lt;/ref&gt;

One purpose of karezza is the maintenance, and indeed, intensification of desire and enjoyment of sexual pleasure within the context of  relationships. According to Stockham, it takes from two weeks to a month for the body to recover from ejaculation ... "Unless procreation is desired, let the final propagative orgasm be entirely avoided".{{sfn |Stockham |1896 |p=25}} Stockham advocated that the 'honeymoon period' of a relationship could be maintained in perpetuity by limiting the frequency of ejaculations or preferably avoiding them entirely.{{sfn |Stockham |1896 |p=15}}

Kalman Andras Oszlar writes, "Inasmuch as sexual togetherness is not limited into the physical world and does not mean quick wasting of sexual energies, by this we give free way to higher dimensions in the relationship." Affected by this we may be gotten into the state of flow experience (abbreviated as flow) and in the course of this the couple charges up with energy, while – with focused attention (Dharana) – the couple is submerging in which they are having pleasure. This state of mind is connected with the achieved beneficial effects by tantric restraint and transformation. At first the definition of positive philosophy was defined by [[Mihály Csíkszentmihályi]] and since then it is referred beyond the professional line. According to the professor the flow-experience is an entirely focused and a motivationally intensified experience where in the course of this people can entirely focus and properly command their feelings for the best performance or learning.

===General===
There is a slight difference between karezza and coitus reservatus.  In coitus reservatus, unlike karezza, a woman can enjoy a prolonged orgasm while a man exercises self-control; similarly, in the context of two male sexual partners, the receptive partner can enjoy the stimulation of his prostate for a longer period of time than he would otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Rudolf Von Urban, M. D. ''Sex Perfection and Marital Happiness'', Dial Press, 1949  ISBN B001AA3TWA&lt;/ref&gt;

Like [[coitus interruptus]], coitus reservatus is not a reliable form of preventing a [[sexually transmitted disease]], as the penis leaks [[pre-ejaculate]] prior to ejaculation, which may contain all of the same infectious viral particles and bacteria as the actual [[semen]]. Although studies have not found sperm in pre-ejaculate fluid,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
|title=Researchers find no sperm in pre-ejaculate fluid
|journal = Contraceptive Technology Update
|volume = 14 | issue = 10 |pages=154–156 |date=October 1993 | pmid = 12286905 }}

&lt;/ref&gt; the method is also unreliable for [[contraception]] because of the difficulty of controlling ejaculation beyond the point of no return in over-reaching the orgasm. Additionally, if it follows an earlier orgasm, it is possible for pre-ejaculate fluid to pick up sperm from a previous ejaculation, leading to pregnancy even when performed correctly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Withdrawal Method |work=Planned Parenthood |date=March 2004 | url =http://www.plannedparenthood.com/health-topics/birth-control/withdrawal-pull-out-method-4218.htm |accessdate=2008-03-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Views on ''coitus reservatus''===
The [[Oneida Community]], founded in the 19th century by [[John Humphrey Noyes]], experimented with coitus reservatus which was then called '''male continence''' in a religiously [[Christian]] [[communalism|communalist]] environment. The experiment lasted for about a quarter of a century and then Noyes went on to create Oneida silverware and establish the Oneida Silver Co. that grew into [[Oneida Limited]].{{sfn |Ellis |1910 |p=553}}  Noyes identified three functions of the sexual organs: the urinary, the propagative and the amative. Noyes believed in the separation of the amative from the propagative, and he put amative sexual intercourse on the same footing with other ordinary forms of social interchange. Sexual intercourse as Noyes defines it is the insertion of the penis into the vagina; ejaculation is not a requirement for sexual intercourse.&lt;ref name="Noyes 1872"&gt;{{cite book |title=Male continence |website=Syracuse University Library - Department of Special Collections - Oneida Community Collection |authorlink=John Humphrey Noyes |first=John Humphrey |last=Noyes |archiveurl=https://iiif.lib.harvard.edu/manifests/view/drs:2577486$1i |archivedate=2017-11-03 |deadurl=no |year=1877 |orig-year=1872 |location=Oneida, NY |publisher=Office of the American Socialist |oclc=786280936 |url=https://library.syr.edu/digital/collections/m/MaleContinence-51k/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

English novelist [[Aldous Huxley]], in his last novel ''Island'' wrote that Maithuna, the Yoga of Love is... "the same as what [[Roman Catholicism]] means by ''coitus reservatus''."&lt;ref&gt;Huxley, Aldous ''Island, Harper &amp; Row, 1962''&lt;/ref&gt; Getting to the point by discussing ''coitus reservatus'', Alan W. Watts in ''Nature, Man and Woman'' notes: "...I would like to see someone make a case for the idea that the [[Apostles]] really did hand down an inner tradition to the Church, and that through all these centuries the Church has managed to guard it from the public eye. If so, it has remained far more secret and [[esotericism|"esoteric"]] than in any of the other great spiritual traditions of the world, so much so that its existence is highly doubtful..."&lt;ref&gt;"Watts, Alan W. ''Nature, Man and Woman, Ch 7, Pantheon Books Inc. 1958''&lt;/ref&gt; The Welsh writer [[Norman Lewis (author)|Norman Lewis]], in his celebrated account of life in [[Naples]] in 1944, claimed that [[Saint Roch|San Rocco]] was the [[patron saint]] of coitus reservatus:  "I recommended him to drink -- as the locals did -- [[Marsala wine|marsala]] with the yolk of eggs stirred into it, and to wear a medal of San Rocco, patron of coitus reservatus, which could be had in any religious-supplies shop".&lt;ref name="Lewis 2005 p. "&gt;{{cite book |last=Lewis |first=Norman |title=Naples '44 : a World War II diary of occupied Italy |publisher=Carroll &amp; Graf |publication-place=New York |year=2005 |isbn=9781480433250 |oclc=854852494 |url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/naples-44-a-world-war-ii-diary-of-occupied-italy/oclc/854852494/viewport}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coitus reservatus is said by some authors to be a part of the teachings of the Catholic Church regarding sexual intercourse and to be a permitted form of intercourse but was subject to the same arguments as coitus interruptus.&lt;ref name="Bullough 2001 p. "&gt;{{cite book |last=Bullough |first=Vern |title=Encyclopedia of birth control |publisher=ABC-CLIO |publication-place=Santa Barbara, Calif |year=2001 |isbn=9781576075333 |page= |oclc=50174689}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the [[Acta Apostolicae Sedis]], the Catholic Church condemned this practice, under the Latin term "amplexus reservatus" (reserved embrace).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Denzinger |first=Heinrich|title=Enchiridion Symbolorum |publisher=Ignatius Press |publication-place=San Francisco, Calif |year=2012 |isbn=9780898707465 |page=810 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The psychologist [[Havelock Ellis]] writes: "''Coitus Reservatus'', – in which intercourse is maintained even for very long periods, during which a woman may have orgasm several times while the penetrative partner succeeds in holding back orgasm, – so far from being injurious to a woman, is probably the form of coitus which gives her the maximum gratification and relief".{{sfn |Ellis |1910 |p=552}}

== Rosicrucians ==
The [[AMORC]] [[Rosicrucians]] declare openly that they do not engage in sexual practices of an occult nature. This has been so since their First Imperator [[H. Spencer Lewis]], Ph. D. made it public knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, H. Spencer ''Rosicrucian Manual'', p. 5, Supreme Grand Lodge of AMORC, 1978&lt;/ref&gt; Their rival organization [[Fraternitas Rosae Crucis]] led by Dr. [[R. Swinburne Clymer]] engages in sexual practices for the sake of race regeneration. Dr. Clymer is completely opposed to the practice of Karezza or ''coitus reservatus'' and advocates instead a form of sex intercourse in which the couple experiences the orgasm at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;Clymer, R. Swinburne MD, ''The Mystery of Sex and Race Regeneration'', p. 223, The Philosophical Publishing Co., 1950&lt;/ref&gt; The Secretary of the [[FUDOSI]] instead heartily approves the practice of Karezza to establish harmony in the family as well as in the world by preventing the waste and misuse of sex energy.&lt;ref&gt;Marc Lanval, editor, ''Lumière et Liberté'', Organe Officiel de la Ligue Belge de Propagande Héliophile, Octobre-Novembre 1933&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. [[Arnold Krumm-Heller]] established the [[Fraternitas Rosicruciana Antiqua]] (FRA), a Rosicrucian school in Germany with branches in South America, having the following formula of sexual conduct: "Immissio Membri Virile In Vaginae Sine Ejaculatio Seminis" (Introduce the penis in the vagina without ejaculating the semen). [[Samael Aun Weor]] experimented with that formula and developed the doctrine of ''[[The Perfect Matrimony]]''.

== "Dianism" in Sex Magick == 
{{main|Dianism}}
Inspired by [[Ida Craddock]]'s work Heavenly Bridegrooms, American occultist [[C.F. Russell]] developed his own curriculum of [[sex magick]].&lt;ref name="google.com2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yFs3qoTFVz8C&amp;pg=PA12|title=The Complete Magick Curriculum of the Secret Order G.B.G.|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 1960s, disciple Louis T.

== Controversy ==

[[Alice Bunker Stockham|Alice Stockham]] was taken to court and forced to give up teaching the practice of Karezza in the [[United States]]. Like many other sex reformers, Dr. Stockham was arrested by [[Anthony Comstock]].&lt;ref&gt;John P. Deveney ''Paschal B. Randolph'', p. 393, SUNY Press, 1997 {{ISBN|978-0-7914-3119-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; He jailed for long terms a variety of spiritual marriage reformers including [[Paschal Beverly Randolph]] who had been a personal friend of [[Abraham Lincoln]].&lt;ref&gt;Paschal B. Randolph ''Ravalette: The Rosicrucian's Story'', p. 64, Kessinger Publishing, 2005 {{ISBN|978-0-7661-9160-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ida Craddock]] committed [[suicide in the United States|suicide]] after being repeatedly jailed for peddling [[pornography]].&lt;ref&gt;Vern L. Bullough ''Encyclopedia of Birth Control'', pp. 76-9, ABC-CLIO, 2001 {{ISBN|978-1-57607-181-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Oneida Community]] was attacked in the press and Noyes was forced to flee to [[Canada]] due to a warrant being issued for his arrest on a [[statutory rape]] charge on June 22, 1879. From there, he advised others to follow [[St. Paul]]'s plan of either [[marriage]] or [[celibacy]], and to obey the [[Ten Commandments|commandments]] against [[adultery]] and [[fornication]].&lt;ref&gt;Patricia Gutek ''Visiting Utopian Communities'', p. 137, [[University of South Carolina Press]], 1998 {{ISBN|978-1-57003-210-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In mathematics, and especially in [[category theory]], a '''commutative diagram''' is a [[Diagram (category theory)|diagram]] such that all directed paths in the diagram with the same start and endpoints lead to the same result. Commutative diagrams play the role in category theory that [[equations]] play in [[algebra]] (see Barr–Wells, Section 1.7).


==Description==
Parts of the diagram:
* objects (also known as ''vertices'') 
* [[morphism]]s (also known as ''arrows'' or ''edges'')
* path or [[category (mathematics)#Definition|composition]]
===Arrow symbols===
In algebra texts, the type of [[morphism]] can be denoted with different arrow usages: 
* [[monomorphism]]s with a &lt;math&gt;\hookrightarrow&lt;/math&gt;
* [[epimorphism]]s with a &lt;math&gt;\twoheadrightarrow&lt;/math&gt;
* [[isomorphism]]s with a &lt;math&gt;\overset{\sim}{\rightarrow}&lt;/math&gt;. 
* the dashed arrow typically represents the claim that the indicated morphism exists whenever the rest of the diagram holds; the arrow may optionally be labeled &lt;math&gt;\exists&lt;/math&gt;. 
** If the dashed arrow is labeled &lt;math&gt;!&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\exists!&lt;/math&gt;, the morphism is furthermore unique. 

These [[Convention (norm)|conventions]] are common enough that texts often do not explain the meanings of the different types of arrow.

===Verifying commutativity===
Commutativity makes sense for a [[polygon]] of any finite number of sides (including just 1 or 2), and a diagram is commutative if every polygonal subdiagram is commutative.

Note that a diagram may be non-commutative, i.e., the composition of different paths in the diagram may not give the same result.

==Phrases==
Phrases like "this commutative diagram" or "the diagram commutes" may be used.

==Examples==
In the bottom-left diagram, which expresses the [[Isomorphism_theorems#First_isomorphism_theorem|first isomorphism theorem]], commutativity means that &lt;math&gt;f = \tilde{f} \circ \pi&lt;/math&gt; while in the bottom-right diagram, commutativity of the square means &lt;math&gt;h \circ f = k \circ g&lt;/math&gt;:

|-
| [[Image:First isomorphism theorem (plain).svg|175px]]
| [[Image:Commutative square.svg|150px]]
|}

For the diagram below to commute, we must have the three equalities: (1) &lt;math&gt; \; r \circ h \circ g = H \circ G \circ l, &lt;/math&gt; (2) &lt;math&gt; \; m \circ g = G \circ l, &lt;/math&gt; and (3) &lt;math&gt;\; r \circ h = H \circ m&lt;/math&gt;. 
Since the first equality follows from the last two, for the diagram to commute it suffices to show (2) and (3). However, since equality (3) does not generally follow from the other two equalities, for this diagram to commute it is generally not enough to only have equalities (1) and (2).

==Diagram chasing==
'''Diagram chasing''' (also called '''diagrammatic search''') is a method of [[mathematical proof]] used especially in [[homological algebra]].  Given a commutative diagram, a proof by diagram chasing involves the formal use of the properties of the diagram, such as [[injective]] or [[surjective]] maps, or [[exact sequence]]s. A [[syllogism]] is constructed, for which the graphical display of the diagram is just a visual aid. It follows that one ends up "chasing" elements around the diagram, until the desired element or result is constructed or verified.

Examples of proofs by diagram chasing include those typically given for the [[five lemma]], the [[snake lemma]], the [[zig-zag lemma]], and the [[nine lemma]].

== In higher category theory ==
{{Main|Higher category theory}}

In higher category theory, one considers not only objects and arrows, but arrows between the arrows, arrows between arrows between arrows, and so on [[wiktionary:ad_infinitum|ad infinitum]]. For example, the category of small categories '''Cat''' is naturally a 2-category, with [[Functor|functors]] as its arrows and [[Natural transformation|natural transformations]] as the arrows between functors. In this setting, commutative diagrams may include these higher arrows as well, which are often depicted in the following style: &lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow&lt;/math&gt;. For example, the following (somewhat trivial) diagram depicts two categories '''{{var|C}}''' and '''{{var|D}}''', together with two functors {{var|F}}, {{var|G}} : '''{{var|C}}''' → '''{{var|D}}''' and a natural transformation {{var|α}} : {{var|F}} ⇒ {{var|G}}:

:[[Image:2-commutative-diagram.svg|200px]]

There are two kinds of composition in a 2-category (called '''vertical composition''' and '''horizontal composition'''), and they may also be depicted via [[pasting diagrams]], see [[2-category#Definition]] for examples.

== Diagrams as functors ==
{{Main|Diagram (category theory)}}

A commutative diagram in a category ''C'' can be interpreted as a [[functor]] from an index category ''J'' to ''C;'' one calls the functor a '''[[diagram (category theory)|diagram]].'''

More formally, a commutative diagram is a visualization of a diagram indexed by a [[poset category]]:
* one draws a node for every object in the index category,
* an arrow for a generating set of morphisms,
*:omitting identity maps and morphisms that can be expressed as compositions,
* and the commutativity of the diagram (the equality of different compositions of maps between two objects) corresponds to the uniqueness of a map between two objects in a poset category.

Conversely, given a commutative diagram, it defines a poset category:
* the objects are the nodes,
* there is a morphism between any two objects if and only if there is a (directed) path between the nodes,
* with the relation that this morphism is unique (any composition of maps is defined by its domain and target: this is the commutativity axiom).

However, not every diagram commutes (the notion of diagram strictly generalizes commutative diagram): most simply, the diagram of a single object with an endomorphism  (&lt;math&gt;f\colon X \to X&lt;/math&gt;), or with two parallel arrows (&lt;math&gt;\bullet \rightrightarrows \bullet&lt;/math&gt;, that is, &lt;math&gt;f,g\colon X \to Y&lt;/math&gt;, sometimes called the [[free quiver]]), as used in the definition of [[equaliser (mathematics)|equalizer]] need not commute. Further, diagrams may be messy or impossible to draw when the number of objects or morphisms is large (or even infinite).

'''Conflict transformation''' is a concept designed to reframe the way in which [[peacebuilding]] initiatives are discussed and pursued, particularly in contexts of [[ethnic conflict]]. Traditionally the emphasis has been on [[conflict resolution]] and [[conflict management]] methods, which focus on reducing or defusing outbreaks of hostility.  '''Conflict transformation''', in contrast, places a greater weight on addressing the underlying conditions which give rise to that conflict, preferably well in advance of any hostility, but also to ensure a [[sustainable]] peace. In other terms, it attempts to make explicit and then reshape the social structures and dynamics behind the conflict, often employing analytical tools borrowed from [[systems thinking]]. "The very structure of parties and relationships may be embedded in a pattern of conflictual relationships that extend beyond the particular site of conflict. Conflict transformation is therefore a process of engaging with and transforming the relationships, interests, discourses and, if necessary, the very constitution of society that supports the continuation of violent conflict".&lt;ref name="Miall"&gt;Hugh Miall (2004) [http://image.berghof-foundation.org/fileadmin/redaktion/Publications/Handbook/Articles/miall_handbook.pdf Conflict Transformation: A Multi-Dimensional Task], Berghof Handbook for Conflict Transformation, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

==Approaches, definitions==
Conflict transformation approaches differ from those of [[conflict management]] or [[conflict resolution]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://image.berghof-foundation.org/fileadmin/redaktion/Publications/Books/Book_Glossary_Chapters_en/berghof_glossary_2012_02_conflict_prevention_management_resolution.pdf Berghof Glossary, Conflict Prevention, Management, Resolution] on [http://www.berghof-foundation.org Berghof Foundation's] web&lt;/ref&gt;
Whereas conflict transformation involves transforming the relationships that support violence, conflict management approaches seek to merely manage and contain conflict, and conflict resolution approaches seek to move conflict parties away from [[zero-sum]] positions towards positive outcomes, often with the help of external actors.&lt;ref name="Miall"/&gt;

Conflict transformation theory and practice are often associated with the academics and practitioners [[Johan Galtung]] and [[John Paul Lederach]].

# ''following [[Buddhist]] thought...&lt;br&gt;Codependent origination, everything grows together in mutual causation.

# ''following [[Christian]] thought...&lt;br&gt;Ultimately, the responsibility for conflict transformation lies with individuals and their individual responsibility and decisions to act so as to promote peace rather than violence, and the principle of hope.''
# ''following [[Daoist]] thought...&lt;br&gt;Everything is yin and yang, good and bad, there is the high likelihood that the action chosen also has negative consequences and that action not chosen may have positive consequences; hence the need for reversibility, only doing what can be undone.''

}}

According to [[Berghof Foundation]], conflict transformation means:
:: ''A generic, comprehensive term referring to actions and processes seeking to alter the various characteristics and manifestations of violent conflict by addressing the root causes of a particular conflict over the long term. It aims to transform negative destructive conflict into positive constructive conflict and deals with structural, behavioural and attitudinal aspects of conflict. The term refers to both the process and the completion of the process. As such, it incorporates the activities of processes such as conflict prevention and conflict resolution and goes farther than conflict settlement or conflict management.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://image.berghof-foundation.org/fileadmin/redaktion/Publications/Handbook/Articles/handbook_glossary.pdf The Berghof Handbook Glossary] &gt; [http://image.berghof-foundation.org/fileadmin/redaktion/Publications/Books/Book_Glossary_Chapters_en/berghof_glossary_2012_03_conflict_transformation.pdf expanded into the Berghof Glossary, Conflict Transformation] on [http://www.berghof-foundation.org Berghof Foundation's] web&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Institute for Conflict Transformation and Peacebuilding]] (ICP), conflict transformation means:
:: ''Conflict transformation, in contrast to conflict resolution, does not only seek to resolve the contradiction in a conflict setting. It also aims at addressing structural and social root causes by challenging injustices and restoring human relations and it deals with ethnical and value-based dimensions. Conflict transformation is not only an approach or a tool but primarily a mindset. Conflict transformation, according to our 3 Cs approach, needs to be comprehensive, compassionate and creative.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iicp.ch/node/10 ''ICP: About Conflict Transformation &amp; Peacebuilding''] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20150209195513/http://www.iicp.ch/node/10 |date=2015-02-09 }} at ICP web [http://www.iicp.ch/ iicp.ch]&lt;/ref&gt;''

According to [[Search for Common Ground]] conflict transformation initiatives are often characterized by longtime horizons and interventions at multiple levels, aimed at changing perceptions and improving communications skills addressing the roots of conflict, including inequality and social injustice.&lt;ref name="SFCG"&gt;SFCG (no date) [http://www.sfcg.org/resources/resources_terms.html Commonly Used Terms] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090829005441/http://www.sfcg.org/resources/resources_terms.html |date=2009-08-29 }}, Search for Common Ground&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Principles of Conflict Transformation'', by [[TransConflict]], specify further in order to help with defining conflict transformation:
{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|
:* ''Conflict should not be regarded as an isolated event that can be resolved or managed, but as an integral part of society’s on-going evolution and development;''
:* ''Conflict should not be understood solely as an inherently negative and destructive occurrence, but rather as a potentially positive and productive force for change if harnessed constructively;''
:* ''Conflict transformation goes beyond merely seeking to contain and manage conflict, instead seeking to transform the root causes of a particular conflict;''
:* ''Conflict transformation is a long-term, gradual and complex process, requiring sustained engagement and interaction;''
:* ''Conflict transformation is not just an approach and set of techniques, but a way of thinking about and understanding conflict itself;''
:* ''Conflict transformation is particularly intended for intractable conflicts, where deep-rooted issues fuel protracted violence;&lt;br&gt;&lt;ref name="TransConflict"&gt;[http://www.transconflict.com/advocate/global-coalition-for-conflict-transformation/principles-of-conflict-transformation/ Principles of Conflict Transformation], TransConflict&lt;/ref&gt;''...continued by some ten more...''

The '''cultural theory of risk''', often referred to simply as '''Cultural Theory''' (with capital letters; not to be confused with [[culture theory]]), consists of a conceptual framework and an associated body of empirical studies that seek to explain societal conflict over risk. Whereas other theories of [[risk perception]] stress economic and cognitive influences, Cultural Theory asserts that structures of social organization endow individuals with perceptions that reinforce those structures in competition against alternative ones. This theory was first elaborated in the book ''[[Natural Symbols]]'', written by anthropologist [[Mary Douglas]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dustinstoltz.com/blog/2014/06/04/diagram-of-theory-douglas-and-wildavskys-gridgroup-typology-of-worldviews|title=Diagram of Theory: Douglas and Wildavsky’s Grid/Group Typology of Worldviews|newspaper=Dustin S. Stoltz|access-date=2016-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1970. Douglas later worked closely with the political scientist [[Aaron Wildavsky]], to clarify the theory. Cultural Theory has given rise to a diverse set of research programs that span multiple social science disciplines and that have in recent years been used to analyze policymaking conflicts generally.

==Theory and evidence==
===Risk and blame, group and grid===
Two features of Douglas’s work inform the basic structure of Cultural Theory. The first of these is a general account of the social function of individual perceptions of societal dangers. Individuals, Douglas maintained, tend to associate societal harms—from sickness to famine to natural catastrophes—with conduct that transgresses societal norms. This tendency, she argued, plays an indispensable role in promoting certain social structures, both by imbuing a society’s members with aversions to subversive behavior and by focusing resentment and blame on those who defy such institutions.&lt;ref&gt;[[#puritydanger|Douglas (1966)]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#riskblame|Douglas (1992)]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The second important feature of Douglas’s work is a particular account of the forms that competing structures of social organization assume. Douglas maintained that cultural ways of life and affiliated outlooks can be characterized (within and across all societies at all times) along two dimensions, which she called “group” and “grid”.&lt;ref&gt;[[#natsymbols|Douglas (1970)]], pp. 54–68.&lt;/ref&gt; A “high group” way of life exhibits a high degree of collective control, whereas a “low group” one exhibits a much lower one and a resulting emphasis on individual self-sufficiency. A “high grid” way of life is characterized by conspicuous and durable forms of stratification in roles and authority, whereas a “low grid” one reflects a more egalitarian ordering.&lt;ref&gt;[[#rayner|Rayner (1992)]], p 86.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although developed in Douglas’s earlier work, these two strands of her thought were first consciously woven together to form the fabric of a theory of risk perception in her and Wildavsky’s 1982 book, ''Risk and Culture : An Essay on the Selection of Technical and Environmental Dangers''. Focusing largely on political conflict over air pollution and nuclear power in the United States, ''Risk and Culture'' attributed political conflict over environmental and technological risks to a struggle between adherents of competing ways of life associated with the group–grid scheme: an egalitarian, collectivist (“low grid”, “high group”) one, which gravitates toward fear of environmental disaster as a justification for restricting commercial behavior productive of inequality; and individualistic ("low group") and hierarchical ("high grid") ones, which resist claims of environmental risk in order to shield private orderings from interference, and to defend established commercial and governmental elites from subversive rebuke.

Later works in Cultural Theory systematized this argument. In these accounts, group–grid gives rise to either four or five discrete ways of life, each of which is associated with a view of nature (as robust, as fragile, as capricious, and so forth) that is congenial to its advancement in competition with the others.&lt;ref&gt;[[#mama|Mamadouh (1999)]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Thompson, Ellis 1990"&gt;[[#ct|Thompson, Ellis &amp; Wildvasky (1990)]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Survey studies===
A variety of scholars have presented survey data in support of Cultural Theory. The first of these was Karl Dake, a graduate student of Wildavsky, who correlated perceptions of various societal risks—environmental disaster, external aggression, internal disorder, market breakdown—with subjects’ scores on attitudinal scales that he believed reflected the “cultural worldviews” associated with the ways of life in Douglas’s group–grid scheme.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Dake|Dake (1991)]].&lt;/ref&gt; Later researchers have refined Dake’s measures and have applied them to a wide variety of environmental and technological risks.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Langford|Langford, Georgiu, Bateman, Day &amp; Turner (2000)]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#peters|Peters &amp; Slovic (1996)]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#poortinga|Poortinga (2002)]].&lt;/ref&gt; Such studies furnish an indirect form of proof by showing that risk perceptions are distributed across persons in patterns better explained by culture than by other asserted influences.

===Case studies===
Other scholars have presented more interpretive empirical support for Cultural Theory. Developed in case-study form, their work shows how particular risk-regulation and related controversies can plausibly be understood within a group-grid framework.&lt;ref&gt;[[#clumsy|Verweij &amp; Thompson (2006)]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://plt.sagepub.com/content/11/3/242.abstract Hartmann, T. (2012).Wicked problems and clumsy solutions: Planning as expectation management. Planning Theory, 11(3), 242–256. doi: 10.1177/1473095212440427]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship to other risk perception theories==
Cultural Theory is an alternative to two other prominent theories of risk perception. The first, which is grounded in [[rational choice theory]], treats risk perceptions as manifesting individuals’ implicit weighing of costs and benefits.&lt;ref&gt;[[#starr|Starr (1969)]].&lt;/ref&gt; Douglas and Wildavsky criticized this position in ''Risk and Culture'', arguing that it ignores the role of cultural ways of life in determining what states of affairs individuals see as worthy of taking risks to attain.&lt;ref&gt;[[#riskculture|Douglas &amp; Wildavsky (1982)]], pp. 194–95.&lt;/ref&gt; The second prominent theory, which is grounded in social psychology and [[behavioral economics]], asserts that individuals’ risk perceptions are pervasively shaped, and often distorted by heuristics and biases.&lt;ref&gt;[[#kahneman|Kahneman, Slovic &amp; Tversky (1982)]].&lt;/ref&gt; Douglas maintained that this “psychometric” approach naively attempted to “depoliticize” risk conflicts by attributing to cognitive influences beliefs that reflect individuals’ commitments to competing cultural structures.&lt;ref&gt;[[#depoliticization|Douglas (1997)]], pp. 123–26.&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, some scholars, including [[Paul Slovic]], a pioneer in the development of the psychometric theory, and [[Dan Kahan]] have sought to connect the psychometric and cultural theories. This position, known as the [[cultural cognition]] of risk, asserts that the dynamics featured in the psychometric paradigm are the mechanisms through which group-grid worldviews shape risk perception.&lt;ref&gt;[[#feardemoc|Kahan, Slovic, Braman &amp; Gastil (2006)]], p. 1084.&lt;/ref&gt; Considering such a program, Douglas herself thought it unworkable, saying that “[i]f we were invited to make a coalition between group-grid theory and psychometrics, it would be like going to heaven”.&lt;ref&gt;[[#depoliticization|Douglas (1997)]], p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt; Such deeply ironic statements are scattered through her work as indicating an unattainable mirage of 'positionlessness': understanding and knowledge must, for Douglas, always emerge from a particular, partial, position, as is evident from the opening chapters of her 1982 book with Wildavsky.

==Application beyond risk perception==

Theorists working with Cultural Theory have adapted its basic components, and in particular the group-grid typology, to matters in addition to risk perception. These include [[political science]],&lt;ref&gt;[[#ctps|Thompson, Grendstate &amp; Selle (1999)]].&lt;/ref&gt; public policy,&lt;ref&gt;[[#swedlow|Swedlow (2002)]].&lt;/ref&gt; [[public management]] and [[organizational studies]],&lt;ref&gt;[[#hood|Hood (1998)]].&lt;/ref&gt; law&lt;ref&gt;[[#feardemoc|Kahan, Slovic, Braman &amp; Gastil (2006)]]&lt;/ref&gt; and sustainability.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sapiens.revues.org/index1177.html Thompson, M. (2011) “Sustainability is an essentially contested concept”. ''S.A.P.I.EN.S.'' '''4''' (1) ]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
The Cultural Theory of risk has been subject to a variety of criticisms. Complexities and ambiguities inherent in Douglas’s group-grid scheme, and the resulting diversity of conceptualizations among cultural theorists, lead Åsa Boholm to believe the theory is fatally opaque.&lt;ref&gt;[[#boholm|Boholm (2003)]], p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt; She also objects to the theory’s embrace of [[Structural functionalism|functionalism]],&lt;ref name="Thompson, Ellis 1990"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#hit|Douglas (1986)]]&lt;/ref&gt; a controversial mode of analysis that sees the needs of collective entities (in the case of Cultural Theory, the ways of life defined by group-grid), rather than the decisions of individuals about how to pursue their own ends, as the principal causal force in social relations.&lt;ref&gt;[[#boholm|Boholm (2003)]], pp. 68, 79–80.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, both Boholm and {{Harvcoltxt|van der Linden|2015}} note that cultural theory is circular in its logic. Commentators have also critiqued studies that purport to furnish empirical evidence for Cultural Theory, particularly survey studies, which some argue reflect unreliable measures of individual attitudes and in any case explain only a modest amount of the variance in individual perceptions of risk.&lt;ref&gt;[[#marris|Marris, Langford, &amp; O'Riordan (1998)]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#sjoberg|Sjöberg (1998)]].&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, some resist Cultural Theory on political grounds owing to Douglas and Wildavsky’s harsh denunciation of environmentalists in ''Risk and Culture''.&lt;ref&gt;[[#winner|Winner (1982)]].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Seal of the United States Patent and Trademark Office.svg|right|150px|Official seal of the USPTO]]
The '''doctrine of foreign equivalents''' is a rule applied in [[United States trademark law]] which requires courts and the [[TTAB]] to translate foreign words in determining whether they are registrable as trademarks, or confusingly similar with existing marks. The doctrine is intended to protect consumers within the United States from confusion or deception caused by the use of terms in different languages. In some cases, a party will use a word as a mark which is either [[genericness|generic]] or [[descriptiveness|merely descriptive]] of the goods in a foreign language, or which shares the same meaning as an existing mark to speakers of that foreign language.

==Test applied==
The [[Trademark Manual of Examining Procedure]] ("TMEP") states the test for applying the doctrine of foreign equivalents is "whether, to those American buyers familiar with the foreign language, the word would denote its English equivalent".&lt;ref&gt;TMEP § 1207.01(b)(vi)&lt;/ref&gt; With respect to descriptive or generic marks, the TMEP specifies that in determining whether a foreign term is entitled to registration, "[t]he test is whether, to those American buyers familiar with the foreign language, the word would have a descriptive or generic connotation".&lt;ref&gt;TMEP § 1209.03(g)&lt;/ref&gt; However, "foreign words from dead or obscure languages may be so unfamiliar to the American buying public that they should not be translated into English for descriptiveness purposes." This test is also applied by courts to determine "whether that foreign word would be descriptive of the product to that segment of the purchasing public which is familiar with that language."&lt;ref&gt;''Pizzeria Uno Corp. v. Temple'', 747 F.2d 1522, 1531 (4th Cir. 1984).&lt;/ref&gt;

It is unclear whether the test differs for asserted cases of [[likelihood of confusion]]. The Federal Circuit has recently clarified the applicability of the doctrine of foreign equivalents in likelihood of confusion cases, stating that "When it is unlikely that an American buyer will translate the foreign mark and will take it as it is, then the doctrine of foreign equivalents will not be applied".&lt;ref name="Palm Bay"&gt;''[[Palm Bay Imports, Inc. v. Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin Maison Fondee en 1772]]'', 396 F.3d 1369, 1377 ([[Fed. Cir.]] 2005)&lt;/ref&gt; The court noted that "the doctrine of foreign equivalents is not an absolute rule and should be viewed merely as a guideline".&lt;ref name="Palm Bay"/&gt; Instead "[t]he doctrine should be applied only when it is likely that the ordinary American purchaser would "stop and translate [the word] into its English equivalent".&lt;ref&gt;''Palm Bay Imports'', citing In re Pan Tex Hotel Corp.'', 190 U.S.P.Q. 109, 110 (T.T.A.B. 1976).&lt;/ref&gt; The Federal Circuit specifically found that "it is improbable that the average American purchaser would stop and translate '[[wikt:veuve|VEUVE]]' into '[[widow]]'".&lt;ref&gt;''See also Popular Bank v. Banco Popular'', 9 F. Supp. 2d 1347, 1359 (S.D. Fla. 1998) (finding a likelihood of confusion between the marks, and noting that "[g]iven large number of people fluent in Spanish in the South Florida area, the Spanish translation is likely to be recognized as the equivalent by South Florida consumers").&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Palm Bay Imports'' case suggests that it is the same test stating "[u]nder the doctrine of foreign equivalents, foreign words from common languages are translated into English to determine genericness, descriptiveness, as well as similarity of connotation in order to ascertain confusing similarity with English word marks."&lt;ref name="Palm Bay"/&gt;

=== The Ordinary American Purchaser ===
As noted above, in [[Palm Bay Imports, Inc. v. Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin Maison Fondee en 1772|Palm Bay]], the Federal Circuit held that the doctrine of foreign equivalents only applies when the "ordinary American purchaser" is likely to translate the foreign mark
into English.&lt;ref name="Palm Bay"/&gt;  A short time after ''Palm Bay'' was decided, the [[Trademark Trial and Appeal Board|T.T.A.B.]] interpreted "ordinary American purchaser" in ''In re Thomas'' and held that the ordinary American purchaser includes only purchasers "familiar with the foreign language."&lt;ref&gt;[http://ttabvue.uspto.gov/ttabvue/ttabvue-78334625-EXA-12.pdf In re Thomas], 9 U.S.P.Q.2d 1021, 1024 (T.T.A.B. 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;  This narrow definition of "ordinary American purchaser" effectively guaranteed that the doctrine would be applied in nearly every case involving a foreign word since "those proficient in a non-English language . . . would ordinarily be expected to translate words into English."&lt;ref name="In re Spirits Int’l, N.V"&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13767240001087520782 In re Spirits Int’l, N.V.], 563 F.3d 1347, 1352 (Fed. Cir. 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

At its next opportunity, however, the Federal Circuit abrogated ''Thomas'' in part.  In [[In re Spirits International]], a geographic deceptiveness&lt;ref&gt;[http://tess2.uspto.gov/tmdb/tmep/1200.htm#_T121001b TMEP 1210.01(b); 1210.01(c)]&lt;/ref&gt; case, the Federal Circuit held that the ordinary American purchaser "''includes all American purchasers'', including those proficient in a non-English language."&lt;ref name="In re Spirits Int’l, N.V"/&gt;

However, because the ''Spirits'' court limited its ruling to the doctrine's application with respect to the geographic deceptiveness bar,&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13767240001087520782 In re Spirits Int’l, N.V.], 563 F.3d 1347, 1356 n.5 (Fed. Cir.
2009)&lt;/ref&gt; the Board currently applies the ''Spirits'' definition of ordinary American purchaser in cases of geographic deceptiveness refusals and the ''Thomas'' definition to all other bars.&lt;ref&gt;Serge Krimnus, [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1734567 The Doctrine of Foreign Equivalents at Death's Door], 12 N.C. J.L. &amp; Tech. 159, 185-87 (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Status of words in foreign countries==
Cases have noted that the status accorded to words in foreign countries has no bearing on the registration of marks in the U.S. For example, in ''Anheuser-Busch, Inc. v. Stroh Brewery Co.'',&lt;ref&gt;''[[Anheuser-Busch, Inc. v. Stroh Brewery Co.]]'', 750 F.2d 631, 641-42 (8th Cir. 1984).&lt;/ref&gt; the court rejected as irrelevant the generic usage of the phrase "L.A. beer" in Australia for low alcohol beer. In ''Seiko Sporting Goods USA, Inc. v. Kabushiki Kaisha Hattori Tokeiten'',&lt;ref&gt;''''Seiko Sporting Goods USA, Inc. v. Kabushiki Kaisha Hattori Tokeiten'', 545 F. Supp. 221, 226 (S.D.N.Y. 1982)&lt;/ref&gt; the court stated that "[w]hile plaintiff has sought to show that Seiko is a generic term in Japanese, it is not so recognized in this country. Accordingly, the mark must still be regarded as arbitrary and fanciful in the United States."

Furthermore, "[a] number of cases hold that a term may be generic in one country and suggestive in another".&lt;ref&gt;''Anheuser-Busch, Inc. v. Stroh Brewery Co.'', 750 F.2d 631, 642 (8th Cir. 1984).&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Carcione v. The Greengrocer, Inc.'',&lt;ref&gt;''Carcione v. The Greengrocer, Inc.'', 205 U.S.P.Q. (BNA) 1075 (E.D. Cal. 1979).&lt;/ref&gt; a court rejected as irrelevant the generic use of the term "Greengrocer" in Britain for a retailer of fruit. The defendant argued that the trademark "Greengrocer", which is a generic term in Britain for a retailer of fruits and vegetables, was not entitled to protection as a trademark in the United States. The court rejected this argument on the ground that it is irrelevant how a term is used outside the United States: "The parties agree that the term is generic in Britain. Since we deal here with American trademark law, and thus American consumers, neither British usage nor the dictionary definition indicating such usage are determinative."

==Dead and obscure languages==
TMEP § 1209.03(g) expresses the caveat that "foreign words from dead or obscure languages may be so unfamiliar to the American buying public that they should not be translated into English for descriptiveness purposes." Emphasis added.  "Descriptiveness is evaluated according to 'that segment of the purchasing public which is familiar with that language.'" General Cigar Co. v. G.D.M. Inc., 988 F. Supp. 647, 660 (S.D.N.Y. 1997) (quoting 1 McCarthy § 11.14, p.&amp;nbsp;464-65). In that case, the court found that the strength of the Cohiba mark was not diminished by the fact that Cohiba is the Taino Indian word for tobacco, because the Taino language was an obscure language. The court noted:

{{quote|A word which is not in general or common use, and is unintelligible and non-descriptive to the general public, although it may be known to linguists and scientist, may be properly regarded as arbitrary and fanciful and capable of being used as a trademark or trade-name.&lt;ref&gt;''General Cigar'', 988 F. Supp. at 660 (''quoting Le Blume Import co. v. Coty'', 293 F. 344, 358 (2d Cir. 1923)).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Nevertheless, cases exist where trademark registration has been rejected for a word that was generic or descriptive when translated from a language such as [[Latin]] or [[Ancient Greek]].

==Transliterations versus translations==
Where a word is a foreign [[transliteration]] of an English mark, the TTAB has held that there is nothing to translate, and the doctrine of foreign equivalents is not invoked. In ''Green Spot (Thailand) Ltd. v. Vitasoy Int'l Holdings Ltd.'',&lt;ref&gt;''Green Spot (Thailand) Ltd. v. Vitasoy Int'l Holdings Ltd.'' Opposition No. 91165010 (February 21, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; the TTAB considered the application of the doctrine where Green Spot sought to register "Vitamilk", and was opposed by Vitasoy, which was the owner of a senior registration. Green Spot also owned a mark in Chinese characters for which the first sets of characters were transliterations of "vi" and "ta" with no meaning in [[Chinese language|Chinese]], while the third, 奶 (nai) was the Chinese word for "[[milk]]". Green Spot argued that its senior Chinese character mark was the equivalent of Vitamilk, and that Green Spot's ownership of the senior mark gave it the right to own the equivalent English mark. The TTAB refused to apply the doctrine of foreign equivalents, because the transliterations of "vi" and "ta" had no actual translation from Chinese to English.

== Criticism ==
The doctrine has been criticized in recent years.  Commentators have noted that courts have "reached irreconcilable holdings" in applying the doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth J. Rest, [http://home.comcast.net/%7Ejlw28129/Foreign_Equivalents.pdf Lost in Translation: A Critical Examination of Conflicting Decisions Applying the Doctrine of Foreign Equivalents], 96 Trademark Rep. 1211 (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;  It has also been suggested that the doctrine be abolished.&lt;ref&gt;Serge Krimnus, [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1734567 The Doctrine of Foreign Equivalents at Death's Door], 12 N.C. J.L. &amp; Tech. 159 (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6187">'''Dualism in Indian philosophy''' refers to the belief held by certain schools of [[Indian philosophy]] that reality is fundamentally composed of two parts. This mainly takes the form of either mind-matter dualism in [[Buddhist philosophy]] or consciousness-matter dualism in the [[Samkhya]] and [[Yoga (philosophy)|Yoga]] schools of [[Hindu philosophy]]. These can be contrasted with [[mind-body dualism]] in Western [[philosophy of mind]], but also have similarities with it.

Another form of dualism in Hindu philosophy is found in the [[Dvaita]] ("dualism") [[Vedanta]] school, which regards God and the world as two realities with distinct essences; this is a form of [[theistic dualism]]. By contrast, schools such as [[Advaita]] ("nondualism") Vedanta embrace absolute [[monism]] and regard dualism as an illusion (''[[Maya (religion)|maya]]'').

==Buddhist philosophy==
[[File:Dharmakirti.gif|thumb|150 px|right|Dharmakīrti, a key theorist of [[Buddhist atomism]].]]
During the classical era of [[Buddhist philosophy]] in India, philosophers such as [[Dharmakirti]] argued for a dualism between states of consciousness and [[Buddhist atomism|Buddhist atoms]] (the basic building blocks that make up reality), according to the "standard interpretation" of Dharmakirti's Buddhist [[metaphysics]].&lt;ref&gt;Georges B.J. Dreyfus, ''Recognizing Reality'', SUNY Press 1996 ({{ISBN|978-0791430989}})&lt;/ref&gt;

==Samkhya and Yogic philosophy==
While [[Western philosophy|Western philosophical traditions]], as exemplified by Descartes, equate mind with the conscious self and theorize on consciousness on the basis of mind/body dualism; some [[Eastern philosophy|Eastern philosophies]] provide an alternate viewpoint, intimately related to [[substance dualism]], by drawing a metaphysical line between consciousness and matter — where matter includes both body and mind.&lt;ref&gt;Haney, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Isaac, p. 339.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Samkhya]] and [[Yoga (philosophy)|Yoga]], two of the six orthodox ([[āstika]]) schools of [[Hindu philosophy]], "there are two irreducible, innate and independent realities: 1) [[consciousness]] itself ([[Purusha]]), and 2) primordial materiality ([[Prakriti]])".{{cn|date=December 2017}} The unconscious primordial materiality, Prakriti, contains 23 components including intellect ([[buddhi]], mahat), ego ([[ahamkara]]) and mind ([[Manas (early Buddhism)|manas]]). Therefore, the intellect, mind and ego are all seen as forms of unconscious matter.&lt;ref&gt;Haney, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; Thought processes and mental events are conscious only to the extent they receive illumination from Purusha. Consciousness is compared to light which illuminates the material configurations or 'shapes' assumed by the mind. So intellect after receiving cognitive structures form the mind and illumination from pure consciousness creates thought structures that appear to be conscious.&lt;ref name="page342"&gt;Isaac, p. 342.&lt;/ref&gt;  Ahamkara, the ego or the phenomenal self, appropriates all mental experiences to itself and thus, personalizes the objective activities of mind and intellect by assuming possession of them.&lt;ref&gt;Leaman, p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt; But consciousness is itself independent of the thought structures it illuminates.&lt;ref name="page342"/&gt;

By including mind in the realm of matter, Samkhya-Yoga avoids one of the most serious pitfalls of Cartesian dualism, the violation of physical conservation laws.{{according to|date=December 2017}} Because mind is an evolute of matter, mental events are granted causal efficacy and are therefore able to initiate bodily motions.&lt;ref&gt;Leaman, p. 248.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dvaita philosophy==
The [[Dvaita Vedanta]] school of [[Indian philosophy]] espouses a dualism between God and the universe by theorizing the existence of two separate [[realities]]. The first and the more important reality is that of [[Shiva]] or [[Shakti]] or [[Vishnu]] or [[Brahman]]. Shiva or Shakti or Vishnu is the supreme [[Self]], God, the absolute truth of the universe, the independent reality. The second reality is that of dependent but equally real universe that exists with its own separate essence. Everything that is composed of the second reality, such as individual soul ([[Jiva]]), matter, etc. exist with their own separate reality. The distinguishing factor of this philosophy as opposed to [[Advaita Vedanta]] ([[monistic]] conclusion of Vedas) is that God takes on a personal role and is seen as a real eternal entity that governs and controls the universe.{{cn|date=March 2018}} Because the existence of individuals is grounded in the divine, they are depicted as reflections, images or even shadows of the divine, but never in any way identical with the divine. [[Moksha|Salvation]] therefore is described as the realization that all finite reality is essentially dependent on the Supreme.&lt;ref&gt;Fowler, Jeaneane D.

'''Dynamic consent''' is a new approach to consent that engages individuals in decisions about how their personal information should be used. It is a personalised, digital communication interface that enables two-way communication between participants and researchers, and puts participants at the centre of decision making.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=24801761 | doi=10.1038/ejhg.2014.71 | volume=23 | title=Dynamic consent: a patient interface for twenty-first century research networks | pmc=4130658 | year=2015 | journal=Eur.

== Background ==
Researchers are required to obtain [[informed consent]] from potential participants before any [[research]] begins – this is a fundamental principle of medical research as laid out in the [[Declaration of Helsinki]]. Traditionally this has been done through a paper consent form which is accompanied by a subject information sheet that describes the risks and benefits of being involved in the research. Increasingly, this also outlines how an individual’s data will be protected and their [[privacy]] maintained.  This constitutes a formal agreement that specifies how a [[research participant]]’s data will be used in that particular study. Participants should be informed about the purpose(s) for which their data will (or may) be used; where it will be stored; the expected retention time; if any other parties are involved; the amount and the sensitivity of the information exchanged; whether the data will be shared onward to yet other parties; whether the consent to use these data can be revoked. Consent to [[data processing]] is also a requirement of [https://www.gov.uk/data-protection/the-data-protection-act data protection] and [[Information privacy|privacy]] laws in most countries. Traditionally, participants have obtained details of how their data will be used from patient information sheets and face-to-face interactions with researchers or healthcare staff.

However, now both medical research and data processing are changing through developments in [[information communication technology]], especially the [[internet]] with examples including genetic databases and registries, [[electronic health records]], [[biobanks]], and online digital services and databases. More and more data is being collected online and being stored in large [[data set]]s with the intention for them to be used by many researchers, research groups and institutions for a variety of purposes.  These include different research projects, as well as public health assessments, [[marketing]], and the design of [[algorithms]] and [[data mining]].

The collection and use of data in this way raises some challenges. Firstly with regard to privacy: can participants' data and identity truly be [[Anonymity|anonymised]] and sensitive data be kept safe and [[Confidentiality|confidential]]? Individuals, in general, are not aware of how their [[personal information]] is used, for what purpose and which parties have a copy. They are not usually given the opportunity to declare their specific consents and privacy-related personal data management preferences. Secondly, with regard to consent: informed consent requires a person to know in advance what they are agreeing to and what the likely risks and benefits of agreeing will be. But with these large, linked data sets, it is often not clear at the time someone is asked to consent how their data will be used in the future.

This is known as a broad consent or a blanket consent. Blanket consent means that a person effectively agrees to permit any and all uses of their data once it is provided. Broad consent is more common and involves agreeing to a broad set of potential future uses under a particular governance framework. Broad consent has become the standard practice in many genetic registries and biobanks&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wma.net/policies-post/wma-declaration-of-taipei-on-ethical-considerations-regarding-health-databases-and-biobanks/|title=WMA - The World Medical Association-WMA Declaration of Taipei on Ethical Considerations regarding Health Databases and Biobanks|website=www.wma.net|language=en-US|access-date=2017-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Its legal and ethical adequacy has been questioned.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Timothy Caulfield|last2=Jane Kaye|date=2009-09-01|title=Broad Consent in Biobanking: Reflections on Seemingly Insurmountable                Dilemmas|url=https://doi.org/10.1177/096853320901000201|journal=Medical Law International|language=en|volume=10|issue=2|pages=85–100|doi=10.1177/096853320901000201|issn=0968-5332}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, consent is still frequently done as a one-off procedure with a paper form for participants to sign. These forms are often lost or filed away, and over time people forget what they have consented to and why.

== What is dynamic consent?==
Dynamic consent is a personalised digital interface to facilitate participant engagement in clinical and research activities over time. It seeks to address some of the issues raised by the traditional, paper-based, static consent approach, where consent must be obtained for all future activities in a face to face interview. Dynamic consent operates through a secure IT interface for consent and communication that enables participants to view a digital record of their consent decisions, subsequent to their initial agreement. Some versions of dynamic consent also have the functionality for people to personalise according to their preferences, which can be changed at any time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Platform for Engaging Everyone Responsibly|url=http://www.geneticalliance.org/programs/biotrust/peer/|website=Genetic Alliance|accessdate=17 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further, dynamic consent aims to put people in control of their data and how it is used, reflecting patient-centric initiatives happening elsewhere in medical research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dwamena|first=Francesca|last2=Holmes-Rovner|first2=Margaret|last3=Gaulden|first3=Carolyn M|last4=Jorgenson|first4=Sarah|last5=Sadigh|first5=Gelareh|last6=Sikorskii|first6=Alla|last7=Lewin|first7=Simon|last8=Smith|first8=Robert C|last9=Coffey|first9=John|date=2012-12-12|title=Interventions for providers to promote a patient-centred approach in clinical consultations|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.cd003267.pub2|journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|doi=10.1002/14651858.cd003267.pub2|issn=1465-1858}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the tool, participants can consent to new projects or change their consent choices; they can complete surveys and receive information about research findings. Preferences are linked with a participant's samples and data and so if these are shared, so too are the individual's preferences. It enables people to give a range of different kinds of consent, for example, a broad consent to low-risk epidemiological research or an explicit consent to a new, high-risk proposal. This flexibility is enabled by the digital interface where preferences can be changed in line with new situations.

Dynamic consent may facilitate recruitment in research, as information is provided to potential participants in a user-friendly and standardised way across research sites and irrespective of the participants' geographical location.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Budin-Ljøsne et al|first1=I|title=Dynamic Consent: a potential solution to some of the challenges of modern biomedical research.|journal=BMC Medical Ethics|date=25 Jan 2017|issue=18(1):4.|url=https://bmcmedethics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12910-016-0162-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pang|first=Patrick Cheong-Iao|last2=Chang|first2=Shanton|last3=Verspoor|first3=Karin|last4=Clavisi|first4=Ornella|date=2018-10-30|title=The Use of Web-Based Technologies in Health Research Participation: Qualitative Study of Consumer and Researcher Experiences|url=https://www.jmir.org/2018/10/e12094/|journal=Journal of Medical Internet Research|language=en|volume=20|issue=10|pages=e12094|doi=10.2196/12094|issn=1438-8871}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dynamic consent enables two-way, ongoing communication between researchers and research participants. For instance, research participants are able to upload additional health data, or researchers may inform participants about new research opportunities or findings. Such ongoing interface may increase the participants' understanding of research and positively impact retention rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Budin-Ljøsne|first=Isabelle|last2=Teare|first2=Harriet J.

== What makes dynamic consent dynamic? ==
This digital interface is dynamic because individuals can:
* give different kinds of consents (e.g. broad, explicit, specific) to different activities
* change their consent preferences to the use of their samples and information in real time in response to their changing circumstances
* enrol in new studies or engage in self-reported research
* receive up to date information on how their samples and data are being used and on the progress and outcomes of research
* tailor the way they receive information, change these preferences over time and have a record of all transactions in one place
* be contacted easily by researchers when there is a protocol change, their opinion is needed or a new consent is required.&lt;ref&gt;Teare, HJA; Morrison, M; Whitley, EA; Kaye, J (2015).

== History of dynamic consent ==
=== First Genetic Trust ===
In 2001 First Genetic Trust (FGT) put forward the idea that they act as a 'broker' of genetic information. They would be a third party between people taking part in research that involved their genetic data and those carrying out the research. FGT recommended a method that would protect 'the confidentiality of individual medical and genetic information, allowing access to select information and the use or application of an individual's DNA only when the patient has given specific consent.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=First Genetic Trust selects HP as technology partner|url=http://www.hp.com/hpinfo/newsroom/press/2002/020211a.html|website=Hewlett Packard (HP) Co. Newsroom|accessdate=14 September 2012|date=11 February 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system has characteristics of dynamic consent before the term was coined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wee|first1=Richman|title=Dynamic consent in the digital age of biology|journal=Journal of Primary Health Care|date=September 2013|volume=5|issue=3|page=259|url=http://www.publish.csiro.au/hc/pdf/HC13259|accessdate=19 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== EnCoRe ===
The EnCoRe project – Ensuring Consent and Revocation – began in 2008 and ran until 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Welcome to the EnCoRe project website!|url=http://www.hpl.hp.com/breweb/encoreproject/index.html|website=EnCoRe|accessdate=23 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was funded by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council ([[EPSRC]]), the Economic and Social Research Council ([[ESRC]]) and the UK government's [[Technology Strategy Board]]. Institutional partners for the project were [[Hewlett-Packard]] (and specifically the Hewlett-Packard Systems Security Lab in Bristol), the [[Warwick Manufacturing Group]] at the [[University of Warwick]], [[QinetiQ]], [https://www.hwcomms.com/ HW Communications], [https://www.ndph.ox.ac.uk/research/centre-for-health-law-and-emerging-technologies-helex HeLEX] from the [[University of Oxford]] and the [[London School of Economics]].

The project's aim was to give individuals more control over any personal data they disclose to organisations, with an overall vision to make giving and revoking consent as reliable and easy as turning a tap on and off. This was an attempt to tackle the lack of any legal requirement for organisations to obtain consent before using personal data about individuals. EnCoRe aimed to enable people to determine what their information is used for, who it is shared with and for how long and where it is stored.

Three case studies were carried out as part of the EnCore project, each with different requirements for consent and revocation. A technical architecture was produced for each scenario, setting out all the functions needed for the management (including capture and revocation) and enforcement of individuals' consents. The three reports are publicly available online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Public deliverables, papers and other publications|url=http://www.hpl.hp.com/breweb/encoreproject/deliverables.html|website=EnCoRe|accessdate=23 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was in the EnCoRe project that the term 'dynamic consent' was coined by Professor Jane Kaye's team at the University of Oxford and become one of the outputs of the EnCoRe project. It is now used to describe this new way of obtaining consent.

=== InBank ===
Over time, the focus of dynamic consent has shifted from simply enabling participants to change their consent preferences to incorporating it as part of a larger apparatus that facilitates communication between participants and researchers or health professionals. The InBank team at the [[University of Manchester]] looked at dynamic consent as a way of collecting and sharing [[electronic health records]]. The work was UK-focused, considering dynamic consent in the context of the [[NHS]] and positioning it as a device to increase or restore public trust. The public scandal over the [[care.data]] initiative was positioned as evidence of a deficit in trust, and equally that it showed a lack of transparent and accountable governance of people's personal medical records in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Williams|first1=Hawys|last2=Spencer|first2=Karen|last3=Sanders|first3=Caroline|last4=Lund|first4=David|last5=Whitley|first5=Edgar|last6=Kaye|first6=Jane|last7=Dixon|first7=William|title=Viewpoint.

== Dynamic consent in practice ==
There are a number of examples across Europe of where dynamic consent is being used in research projects. One of these is the [https://research.ndorms.ox.ac.uk/rudy/ RUDY] Study - a study of rare diseases led by researchers at the [http://www.ox.ac.uk/ University of Oxford].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Teare|first=Harriet J.

In the USA, the Platform for Engaging Everyone Responsibly ([http://www.geneticalliance.org/programs/biotrust/peer/ PEER]) has been set up by non-profit health advocacy organisation [[Genetic Alliance]] and software company [https://www.privateaccess.info/ Private Access]. Not only can participants choose to consent to only some aspects of research and not to others, but they can also specify preferences for types of data access by third parties and consent to other activities that are offered, such as the use of their biological samples after death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Platform for Engaging Everyone Responsibly|url=http://www.geneticalliance.org/programs/biotrust/peer/|website=Genetic Alliance|accessdate=30 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Challenges to dynamic consent ==
Criticisms have been made about dynamic consent including that it is unnecessary. A number of empirical studies that were carried out before dynamic consent was developed, suggested that people are happy to give broad or 'one-off' consent for some kinds of research. For example, a face-to face interview study of 1001 Scottish adults as part of the prospective Scottish Family Health Study genetic database carried out in 2009 found that respondents preferred 'scenarios where consent is only asked for at the start of the study' over options to renew consent every 5 or 10 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Haddow|first1=Gill|last2=Cunningham-Burley|first2=Sarah|last3=Murray|first3=Lorraine|title=Can the governance of a population genetic data bank effect recruitment? Evidence from the public consultation of Generation Scotland|journal=Public Understanding of Science|date=April 2010|volume=20|issue=117|doi=10.1177/0963662510361655|url=http://pus.sagepub.com/content/20/1/117|accessdate=24 January 2017|pages=117–129}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, a survey of US adults published in 2010, reported a preference for a broad, 'one off' consent at the time of donation to a biobank over giving specific consent for each new study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Simon|first1=Christian|last2=L'Heureux|first2=Jamie|last3=Murray|first3=Jeffrey|last4=Winokur|first4=Patricia|last5=Weiner|first5=George|last6=Newbury|first6=Elizabeth|last7=Shinkunas|first7=Laura|last8=Zimmerman|first8=Bridget|journal=Genetics in Medicine|date=2011|volume=13|issue=9|page=821|doi=10.1097/GIM.0b013e31821d2f88|title=Active choice but not too active: Public perspectives on biobank consent models|pmc=3658114}}&lt;/ref&gt; A meta-analysis of the qualitative sociological literature on public and patient attitudes to biobanking published 2002-9 reached a similar conclusion: 'few people demanded recurrent, project-specific consent and few wished to place limits on the uses to which their tissue could be put'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lipworth|first1=Wendy|last2=Forsyth|first2=Rowena|last3=Kerridge|first3=Ian|title=Tissue donation to biobanks: a review of sociological studies|journal=Sociology of Health and Illness|date=2011|volume=33|issue=5|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9566.2011.01342.x|pages=792–811}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
However, these studies did not present dynamic consent to their respondents as an alternative to a broad consent.

There have been some criticism of dynamic consent by a Norwegian team of researchers, who argued that dynamic consent would be an unwanted burden on participants and a waste of time for researchers. 'In a dynamic consent model, participants will be asked for consent continuously, simply because each new project is a new project. Thus, they will be asked to re-consent both for trivial and essential reasons, and often the former'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kristin Solum|first1=Steinsbekk|last2=Myskja|first2=Bjørn Ka°re|last3=Solberg|first3=Berge|title=Broad consent versus dynamic consent in biobank research: Is passive participation an ethical problem?|journal=European Journal of Human Genetics|date=2013|volume=21|doi=10.1038/ejhg.2012.282|pages=897–902|pmc=3746258}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this opinion was based on an erroneous understanding of dynamic consent as requiring consent for each new study, rather being able to be tailored to the needs and ethical requirements of a particular study.

Steinsbekk et al. in their publication criticising dynamic consent also argued that rather than increasing the number of people taking part in research, dynamic consent may have the opposite effect. 'Being confronted with the detailed complexity of biomedical research, and being asked again and again for an 'opinion' (a consent), it is likely that at least some people will struggle with feelings of falling short – that their own competence or knowledge do not suffice. This could easily be interpreted as a 'lack of respect' for the passive participant, and result in lower participation as people would rather choose to stay away from such studies than face shortcomings.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kristin Solum|first1=Steinsbekk|last2=Myskja|first2=Bjørn Ka°re|last3=Solberg|first3=Berge|title=Broad consent versus dynamic consent in biobank research: Is passive participation an ethical problem?|journal=European Journal of Human Genetics|date=2013|volume=21|doi=10.1038/ejhg.2012.282|pages=897–902|pmc=3746258}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers raise concerns about the impact of consent withdrawal (more easily facilitated by dynamic consent) on the integrity of their research data sets. 

=== Rebuttals ===
There are a number of important limitations to consider when evaluating the results of studies of consent practices. In many cases, while a statistically significant preference for one form of consent over another can be found, this is not necessarily indicative of a clear majority preference. For example, Haddow et al., 2011, characterised their reported consent preferences as 'not strong'. Another study reported that while 58% of respondents described re-consent as 'a waste of time', 51% also felt that being asked for it was an indication that they were 'respected and involved' participants in research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Master|first1=Zubin|last2=Claudio|first2=Jaime|last3=Rachul|first3=Christen|last4=Jean|first4=Wang|last5=Minden|first5=Mark|last6=Caulfield|first6=Timothy|title=Cancer patient perceptions on the ethical and legal issues related to biobanking|journal=BMC Medical Genomics|date=2013|volume=6|issue=8|doi=10.1186/1755-8794-6-8|url=http://bmcmedgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1755-8794-6-8|accessdate=24 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of prospective public attitude surveys on biobanking, of which there are many in the existing literature, Johnsson et al., 2010, found that reported willingness to share data and tissue for research was prone to both overestimating and underestimating recorded participation levels in different cases, leading to questions about the usefulness of this type of research in making predictions of future behaviours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Johnsson|first1=Linus|last2=Helgesson|first2=Gert|last3=Rafnar|first3=Thorunn|last4=Halldorsdottir|first4=Ingibjorg|last5=Chia|first5=Kee-Seng|last6=Eriksson|first6=Stefan|last7=Hansson|first7=Mats G|title=Hypothetical and factual willingness to participate in biobank research|journal=European Journal of Human Genetics|date=2010|volume=18|issue=11|page=1261|doi=10.1038/ejhg.2010.106|pmc=2987483|pmid=20648060}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:EFMS.pdf|thumb|EFMS]]
'''Energy and facility management software''' is a term used to refer to an enterprise-wide platform for handling technical data related to buildings and stems from the merger of [[Energy management software|EMS]] (energy management software), [[Computer-aided facility management|CAFM]] (Computer Aided Facility Management) and [[Energy accounting software|EAS]] (Energy Accounting Software). As such it involves the gathering and processing or information that is required for maintaining acceptable indoor comfort level while minimizing energy use.

==Purpose==
An EFMS serves a dual purpose:

*'''Tactical:''' On a day-to-day operational level an EFMS will help improve comfort level where required while minimizing energy consumption. Should comfort level not be an issue, the EFMS will focus processes and resources on reducing energy spending.
*'''Strategic:''' On a mid-to-long term scope an EFMS will support the development strategy of the organization with information that will support managerial decisions such as systems, vendors or processes efficiencies, ratings and critical areas etc.

== Method ==

=== Information Classes ===
To achieve its purpose an EFMS integrates several informational classes in a common processing environment, mainly:

*'''Energy consumption information''' information commonly handled by an EMS and derived from online metering devices (such as [[Electric energy meter|Energy meters]], [[Gas meter]]s).
*'''System information''' such as [[HVAC|HVAC systems]] settings, sensor readings etc. commonly resident in a [[Building Management System|BMS]].
*'''Assets Information''', such as building size, floor number and area, cooling capacity of installed [[HVAC|HVAC systems]], maintenance logs etc. commonly found in a CAFM system.
*'''Weather information''' commonly derived from internet weather feeds or locally installed sensors.
*'''Occupancy / Use information''' such as room occupancy of a hotel or customers served at a retail store commonly found in an [[Enterprise resource planning|ERP]].
*'''Utility bills information''' commonly resident in an [[Energy accounting software|EAS]] (Energy Accounting Software).

=== Components ===
An EFMS should be consisted of at least the following modules:

*'''Visualization / Dashboard Module''' which will present graphical or table illustrations of energy information (from EMS), system information (from BMS) and Billing information (from EAS).
*'''Alarming Module''' which will create and manage alarms based on given threshold values and / or Faults Detection &amp; Diagnosis detection methods.
*'''Work Order Module''' which will create and manage notifications of alarms directed towards appropriate users. The Work Order Module will manage actions of users related to each fault along the Fault Cycle (birth, detection, diagnosis, action, evaluation).
*'''Data Sources Module''' which will manage the connection to and synchronization with the various data sources such as energy management systems and metering devices, [[Building Management System|BMS]], [[Energy accounting software|EAS]], [[Enterprise resource planning|ERP]] etc.
*'''Reporting Module''' which will manage the creation and distribution of energy and facility reports.

=== Processes ===
The processes performed in an EFMS fall under the categories of:
*'''Entry Processes''' which may be ''tactical'' such as the automated synchronization with a BMS or ERP or ''ad hoc'' such as the manual entry of utility bills data or the upload of a maintenance log.
*'''FDD Processes''' (''Faults Detection &amp; Diagnosis'') which may include sub-processes for setting various thresholds, selecting from a list of rules which ones should be applied to each specific building / installation and the tactical application of rule sets and threshold values to an FDD scanning process of building related data.
*'''Work Order Processes''' which include processes for relaying alerts and faults to users and managing the actions they undertake until the issue is resolved.
*'''Reporting Processes''' which involve tactical creation of visualization elements and reports or ad hoc querying processes for data mining and faults investigation.

==Applications==
Applications of integrated EFMS suites will benefit mostly organizations with either very large and busy facilities, such as malls, hotel complexes and transportation hubs the complexity of which challenges operational efficiency and organizations with many buildings dispersed across remote locations such as retail chains, restaurant chains, banks and food store chains which operate medium-sized buildings that stretch [[facility management]] operations to high costs.

Commercial property managers that plan and manage energy efficiency projects generally use a software platform to perform energy audits and to collaborate with contractors to understand their full range of options. The [http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/tools_directory/software.cfm/ID=622/pagename=alpha_list_sub Department of Energy (DOE) Software Directory] describes EnergyActio software, a cloud based platform designed for this purpose.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12038">'''"Esquisse d'un Programme"''' (Sketch of a Programme) is a famous proposal for long-term mathematical research made by the German-born, French mathematician [[Alexander Grothendieck]] in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;Scharlau, Winifred (September 2008), written at Oberwolfach, Germany, "Who is Alexander Grothendieck", ''Notices of the American Mathematical Society'' (Providence, RI: American Mathematical Society) 55(8): 930–941, {{issn|1088-9477}}, {{OCLC|34550461}}, http://www.ams.org/notices/200808/tx080800930p.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; He pursued the sequence of logically linked ideas in his important project proposal from 1984 until 1988, but his proposed research continues to date to be of major interest in several branches of advanced mathematics. Grothendieck's vision provides inspiration today for several developments in mathematics such as the extension and generalization of [[Galois theory]], which is currently being extended based on his original proposal.

==Brief history==
Submitted in 1984, the ''Esquisse d'un Programme''&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Grothendieck, 1984. "[http://webusers.imj-prg.fr/~leila.schneps/grothendieckcircle/EsquisseFr.pdf Esquisse d'un Programme]", (1984 manuscript), finally published in Schneps and Lochak (1997, I), pp.5-48; English transl., ibid., pp. 243-283. {{MR|1483107}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://matematicas.unex.es/~navarro/res/esquisseeng.pdf|title=Sketch of a programme ''(English translation, hosted by the University of Extremadura)''|accessdate=October 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a proposal submitted by Alexander Grothendieck for a position at the [[French National Centre for Scientific Research|Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique]]. The proposal was not successful, but Grothendieck obtained a special position where, while keeping his affiliation at the university of Montpellier, he was paid by the CNRS and released of his teaching obligations. Grothendieck held this position from 1984 till 1988.&lt;ref&gt;Rehmeyer, Julie (May 9, 2008), "Sensitivity to the Harmony of Things", ''Science News''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, Allyn (November, 2004) "Comme Appelé du Néant - As if summoned from the void: the life of Alexandre Grothendieck", Notices of the AMS&lt;/ref&gt; This proposal was not formally published until 1997, because the author "could not be found, much less his permission requested".&lt;ref&gt;Schneps and Lochak (1997, I) p.1&lt;/ref&gt; The outlines of ''[[dessin d'enfant|dessins d'enfants]]'', or "children's  drawings", and "[[Anabelian geometry]]", that are contained in this manuscript continue to inspire research; thus, "'''Anabelian geometry''' is a proposed theory in [[mathematics]], describing the way the [[algebraic fundamental group]] ''G'' of an [[algebraic variety]] ''V'', or some related geometric object, determines how ''V'' can be mapped into another geometric object ''W'', under the assumption that ''G'' is '''not'''  an [[abelian group]], in the sense of being strongly [[noncommutative]]. The word ''anabelian'' (an [[alpha privative]] ''an-'' before ''abelian'') was introduced in ''Esquisse d'un Programme''. While the work of Grothendieck was for many years unpublished, and unavailable through the traditional formal scholarly channels, the formulation and predictions of the proposed theory received much attention, and some alterations, at the hands of a number of mathematicians. Those who have researched in this area have obtained some expected and related results, and in the 21st century the beginnings of such a theory started to be available."''

===Extensions of Galois's theory for groups: Galois groupoids, categories and functors===
[[Galois]] has developed a powerful, fundamental [[algebraic theory]] in mathematics that provides very efficient computations for certain algebraic problems by utilizing the algebraic concept of [[Group (mathematics)|groups]], which is now known as the theory of [[Galois group]]s; such computations were not possible before, and also in many cases are much more effective than the 'direct' calculations without using groups.&lt;ref&gt;Cartier, Pierre (1998), "La Folle Journée, de Grothendieck à Connes et Kontsevich — Évolution des Notions d'Espace et de Symétrie", ''Les Relations entre les Mathématiques et la Physique Théorique — Festschrift for the 40th anniversary of the ''IHÉS'', Institut des Hautes Études Scientifiques'', pp. 11–19&lt;/ref&gt; To begin with, Alexander Grothendieck stated in his proposal:'' "Thus, the group of Galois is realized as the [[automorphism group]] of a concrete, [[pro-finite group]] which respects certain structures that are essential to this group."'' This fundamental, Galois group theory in mathematics has been considerably expanded, at first to [[groupoids]]- as proposed in Alexander Grothendieck's ''Esquisse d' un Programme'' (''EdP'')- and now already partially carried out for groupoids; the latter are now further developed beyond groupoids to categories by several groups of mathematicians. Here, we shall focus only on the well-established and fully validated extensions of Galois' theory. Thus, EdP also proposed and anticipated, along previous Alexander Grothendieck's ''[[IHÉS]]'' seminars ([[SGA1]] to [[SGA4]]) held in the 1960s, the development of even more powerful extensions of the original Galois's theory for groups by utilizing categories, [[functors]] and [[natural transformations]], as well as further expansion of the manifold of ideas presented in Alexander Grothendieck's ''[[Descent theory|Descent Theory]]''. The notion of [[Motive (algebraic geometry)|motive]] has also been pursued actively. This was developed into the [[motivic Galois group]], [[Grothendieck topology]] and Grothendieck category
.&lt;ref&gt;http://planetmath.org/encyclopedia/GrothendieckCategory.html&lt;/ref&gt; Such developments were recently extended in [[algebraic topology]] ''via'' [[representable functor]]s and the [[fundamental groupoid functor]].

[[File:Dictorum Factorumque Memorabilium Libri IX.jpg|thumb|1830 version of ''Facta et dicta memorabilia'']]
'''''Factorum ac dictorum memorabilium libri IX''''' ("nine books of memorable deeds and sayings", also known as ''De factis dictisque memorabilibus'' or ''Facta et dicta memorabilia'') by [[Valerius Maximus]] (c. 20 BCE&amp;nbsp;– c. CE 50) was written around CE 30 or 31.&lt;ref name="pagexiii"&gt;Walker, p. xiii&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="columbia"&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/65/va/Valerius.html ''The Columbia Encyclopedia'', Sixth Edition (2001-07), s.v. "Valerius Maximus"]&lt;/ref&gt; It is a collection of approximately a thousand short stories that Valerius wrote during the reign of [[Tiberius]] (42 BCE&amp;nbsp;– CE 37).&lt;ref name="pagexiii"/&gt; The stories are a variety of anecdotes illustrating how the [[Ancient Rome|ancient Romans]] lived.&lt;ref name="columbia"/&gt; While the majority of the stories are of Roman life, he does have some foreign stories at the end of some chapters. Most of these are of [[Ancient Greece|Greek life]] and most of those are about [[Greek philosophy|Greek philosophers]] or famous kings.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, p. xix&lt;/ref&gt;

Several of the stories relate to moral subjects that parallel those in the [[Old Testament]] and [[New Testament]]. Valerius refers to his moral stories as "examples" that were to be used as moral guidance.&lt;ref name="pagexxii"/&gt; Valerius' work on the preservation of moral values of the [[Roman Republic]] of the past was widely popular through the [[Age of Enlightenment]], a literary life-span of some 1,700 years. People read Valerius' work for practical guidance in their everyday tasks for living a moral life.&lt;ref name="pagexxii"&gt;Walker, p. xxii&lt;/ref&gt; This work was especially used as a reference by writers and professional [[Public speaking|orators]].&lt;ref name="pagexiii"/&gt;&lt;ref name="columbia"/&gt;

It is estimated that Valerius's work on these nine books took over a decade.&lt;ref name="rarely"/&gt; He obtained material from [[Cicero]], and from [[Livy]], [[Sallust]], [[Gnaeus Pompeius Trogus|Pompeius Trogus]], [[Marcus Terentius Varro]] and other ancient historians.&lt;ref name="rarely"/&gt; Each of the nine books has several chapters. Each chapter is outlined and grouped [[theme (literature)|thematically]] and contains several stories illustrating that theme.&lt;ref name="rarely"/&gt;&lt;ref name="table"&gt;Walker, p. vii '''Table of Contents'''&lt;/ref&gt; This work is the earliest known use of a [[hierarchical organization]] system for topics of a book.&lt;ref&gt;Princeton University Press article ''[http://press.princeton.edu/chapters/s8216.html A short history of information retrieval]''&lt;/ref&gt; There are a total of 91 chapters covering a wide variety of subjects drawn from Roman life.&lt;ref name="table"/&gt; Valerius arranges his chapters focused on particular [[virtue]]s, moral and immoral habits, religious practices, superstitions and ancient traditions.&lt;ref name="table"/&gt; There is a thematic guide at the end of the work.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, p. 355&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subjects==

===Omens===
One example of Valerius' balanced subject themes covered is where he writes stories about [[omen]]s.&lt;ref name="super2"&gt;Walker, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; He notes that the observations of omens had a connection to [[religion in ancient Rome]] since many people of that time believed that omens were from divine providence.&lt;ref name="super2"&gt;Walker, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; Valerius records that omens had played an important role when Rome had been demolished by the [[Gauls]] in 390 BCE. The [[Roman Senate|Senate]] was debating whether they should then move Rome to [[Veii]] or rebuild the city walls.&lt;ref name="super2"&gt;Walker, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;  While they were deciding some [[Cohort (military unit)|cohort]]s had just returned from guard duty.&lt;ref name="super2"&gt;Walker, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;  Their [[centurion]] then just happened to shout in the assembly place, "Standard-bearer, set up the standard; this is the best place for us to stay." The city was rebuilt in the same place then, since they interpreted these words as an omen.&lt;ref name="super2"&gt;Walker, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

===Auspices===
One of the subject themes that Valerius wrote about was the [[superstition]] of [[auspices]] in Book 1 Chapter 4.&lt;ref name="super1"&gt;Walker, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; Auspices means "bird observations." It is from the [[Latin]] words of ''avis'' (bird) and ''spicere'' (to sight or watch).&lt;ref name="super1"&gt;Walker, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; Before doing anything of great importance, the Romans would "take the auspices" in order to determine what the [[Roman mythology|gods]] approved.&lt;ref name="super1"&gt;Walker, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; This was an examination of the behavior of birds in flight or eating.&lt;ref name="super1"&gt;Walker, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; It was interpreted by an [[augur]] as to the will of the gods from this behavior.

A Roman story that Valerius writes about is the founding of Rome by [[Romulus and Remus]].&lt;ref name="super1"&gt;Walker, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; He records that the founding of the city was based on the auspices. Remus was the first to "take the auspices" by seeing six [[vulture]]s.&lt;ref name="super1"&gt;Walker, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; Romulus later however saw twelve vultures. Romulus claimed he had a stronger claim because he saw a larger quantity, even though Remus was the first to spot vultures.&lt;ref name="super1"&gt;Walker, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;

Another "foreign" story Valerius writes on this theme for a comparison is on the founding of the city of [[Alexandria]] in [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]].&lt;ref name="super2"&gt;Walker, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; It was founded by [[Alexander the Great]] in 331 BCE. The [[architect]] was [[Deinocrates]].&lt;ref name="super2"&gt;Walker, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; He records that when Deinocrates was going to design a great city in Egypt, he had no chalk to use for writing.&lt;ref name="super2"&gt;Walker, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; Instead he used a large quantity of [[barley]], and drew out the plans on the ground.&lt;ref name="super2"&gt;Walker, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; A group of birds then came from a nearby lake and ate the barley.&lt;ref name="super2"&gt;Walker, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; The Egyptian augur interpreted this to mean that there would be plenty of food for a large city there.&lt;ref name="super2"&gt;Walker, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modesty===
[[File:Marco Porcio Caton Major.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Cato the Elder]]]]
Valerius writes on the theme of [[modesty]] in Book 4 Chapter 5 about the fact that there was no separate seating for the Conscript Fathers (Roman Senators) at the theater.&lt;ref name="modesty1"&gt;Walker, p. 142, Book 4 Chapter 5.1 reads, ''From the foundation of our city to the consulship of Scipio Africanus and Tiberius Longus there was no separate seating for the Senate and the people when they watched the games. In spite of this, no member of the plebs ever brought himself to sit in front of the Conscript Fathers at the theater; the respect shown in our state was so scrupulous.''&lt;/ref&gt; This was from the beginnings of Rome in the 8th century BCE until the time of the consulship of [[Scipio Africanus]] and [[Tiberius Sempronius Longus (consul 194 BCE)|Tiberius Sempronius Longus]] in 194 BCE.&lt;ref name="modesty1"/&gt; In spite of this no member of the [[pleb]]s ever sat in front of the Conscript Fathers.&lt;ref name="modesty1"/&gt; Their respect for this tradition was also shown when one day [[Lucius Quinctius Flamininus]] was to stand in the very back of the theater.&lt;ref name="modesty1"/&gt; He was placed there because he had been removed from the Roman Senate by [[Cato the Censor]] and [[Lucius Valerius Flaccus]]. Flamininus already held the office of [[Roman consul|consul]] and was the brother of [[Titus Flamininus]] (consul 192 BCE), who had defeated [[Philip V of Macedon]] in 197 BCE.&lt;ref name="modesty1"/&gt; In spite of this he still was forced to go to the back of the theater by Cato the Elder. Out of respect however, the entire audience moved Flamininus to the very front so that nobody was in front of him.&lt;ref name="modesty1"/&gt;

Valerius illustrates another story of modesty when he writes of [[Gaius Terentius Varro]].&lt;ref name="modesty1"/&gt; Varro devastated the Roman Republic when he started the [[Battle of Cannae]], one of the worst battles of recorded history. His sense of shame would not allow him to accept dictatorship, even though it was offered to him.&lt;ref name="modesty1"/&gt; The people of the Republic attributed the great loss to the anger of the gods. On the inscription under his death mask shows his good character which brought him more honor that most men receive from the dictatorship position itself.&lt;ref name="modesty1"/&gt;

Valerius records another story of modesty where king [[Hiero II of Syracuse]] hears of the disastrous defeat of the Romans at the [[Battle of Lake Trasimene]].&lt;ref name="modesty2"&gt;Walker, p. 156&lt;/ref&gt; He immediately sends as a gift to Rome 70,000 bushels of wheat, 50,000 bushels of barley, and 240 pounds of gold.&lt;ref name="modesty2"/&gt; So that the gold was accepted and not returned he presented it in the form of a statue of victory. This was so the Roman people would accept it on religious grounds.&lt;ref name="modesty2"/&gt;

===Parenting===
[[File:Halle CorneliaMotherOfTheCracchi.jpg|thumb|left|An 18th-century portrayal of [[Cornelia Africana|Cornelia]] proclaiming "These are my jewels," in reference to [[Gracchi|her sons]]]]
Another example of Valerius' themes is where he writes stories about Roman parents and the affection they had toward their children. A story in Book 4 Chapter 4 on ''Poverty'' is about the [[Gracchus|Gracchus brothers]], [[Gaius Gracchus]] and his younger brother [[Tiberius Gracchus]]. The story relates how one day [[Cornelia Africana]], their mother (daughter of Publius Cornelius [[Scipio Africanus]]), was pestered by a lady guest that was showing off her elegant jewellery. Cornelia patiently endured this lady until her sons came home from school. Then, introducing them to this lady, she proclaimed proudly, "These are my jewels."&lt;ref&gt;Walker, p. 138&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example in Book 8 Chapter 8 is about the philosopher [[Socrates]]. He writes of him showing an intimate side which did not distract from his stature because, as Valerius puts it, ''no part of wisdom was hidden from him.'' He tells how Socrates one time made a [[hobby horse|hobbyhorse]] out of [[Reed bed|reed]] for his sons. He would then play with the hobbyhorse with them showing Socrates' personal parental side.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, p. 291&lt;/ref&gt;

Valerius writes many stories of other Roman fathers which generally are contrary to the stereotypical image of being brutal and harsh.&lt;ref name=pagexv&gt;Walker, p. xv&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these examples are in Book 5 Chapter 7 titled ''The Love and Indulgence of Parents towards Their Children.''&lt;ref&gt;Walker, p. 189&lt;/ref&gt; He writes that the real fathers are the ones that are benignly permissive and show indulgence.&lt;ref name=pagexv/&gt; He reports with delight that this kind of father could be found in the streets of Rome and that these fathers ''were as gentle as fathers in a comedy.''&lt;ref&gt;Walker, p. 193&lt;/ref&gt; He does, however, describe in Book 5 Chapter 8 ''Fathers who were severe with their children'' some all-powerful Roman abusive fathers as being tyrannical [[patriarch]]s killing and murdering others including of their own blood. He clearly reports these that are extremely strict and severe as no longer in the role of being a loving father.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, p. 191&lt;/ref&gt;

Valerius writes of [[Lucius Junius Brutus]], who killed his sons for failing in their military duties, ''He left the role of a father so that he could play the part of a [[Roman consul|consul]].''&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Valerius_Maximus/5*.html#8.1 Book 5, Chapter 8.1]&lt;/ref&gt; Other examples of these role changes can be found in Book 6. In Chapter 1.5 where Valerius tells the story of [[Quintus Fabius Maximus Eburnus]],&lt;ref name="page19915"&gt;Walker, Book 6, Chapter 1.5, p. 199&lt;/ref&gt; Eburnus had carried out the highest public offices with great splendor and finished off his career with much dignity; however, he had his son punished for a chastity that was dubious.&lt;ref name="page19915"/&gt; In Chapter 1.6 Valerius writes about Publius Atilius Philiscus who was abused as a child.&lt;ref name="page19916"&gt;Walker, Book 6, Chapter 1.6, p. 199&lt;/ref&gt; When he became an adult, Philiscus became a strict father on chastity.&lt;ref name="page19916"/&gt; Learning of his daughter's premarital sex, he murdered her.&lt;ref name="page19916"/&gt;

===The role of women===
{{See also|Women in Ancient Rome}}
[[File:Tizian 094.jpg|thumb|[[Titian]]'s image of the rape of Lucretia]]
Valerius writes of Roman women being generally in seclusion.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} He reports in Book 6 on ''Chastity'' the stereotypical woman as being well-behaved and who would rather face death than dishonor. One story is of [[Lucretia]] in Book 6 Chapter 1.1.&lt;ref name="page198"&gt;Walker, p. 198&lt;/ref&gt; He writes that she was violently forced to have sex with [[Sextus Tarquinius]], the son of King [[Tarquin the Proud]].&lt;ref name="page198"/&gt; Lucretia could not bear the disgrace and committed [[suicide]].&lt;ref name="page198"/&gt; Another example is about [[Hippo, a Greek woman]]. She committed suicide rather than being raped by drunken sailors.&lt;ref&gt;Valerius Maximus [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Valerius_Maximus/6*.html#ext.1 Book 6. ext. 1].&lt;/ref&gt; Valerius even writes in Book 2, Chapter 6.14, of [[suttee]] being an admired practice model for all women to follow in his day.&lt;ref name=pagexv/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Valerius_Maximus/2*.html#6.14 Book 2 Chapter 6.14]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pagexvi"/&gt;

===Homosexuality===
{{See also|Homosexuality in ancient Rome}}
Valerius writes about homosexuality, which was an unusual category for that time period of writers.&lt;ref name="pagexvi"&gt;Walker, p. xvi&lt;/ref&gt; This aspect of private life was kept under wraps.&lt;ref name="pagexvi"/&gt; The only relationship along these lines that was tolerated by law was that between a master and a slave.&lt;ref name="pagexvi"/&gt; Valerius, however, does report on male homosexuality in the [[Roman army]] and the [[upper class]].&lt;ref name="pagexvi"/&gt; He does not report on female homosexuality nor "[[gay women]]" as some writers did at the time.&lt;ref name="pagexvi"/&gt;

===Roman army===
In the stories of the Roman army, Valerius always records high-ranking military personnel taking advantage of their position. In Book 6 Chapter 1.10 Valerius tells the story of Gaius Cornelius.&lt;ref name="page200110"&gt;Walker, Book 6, Chapter 1.10, p. 200&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bk6110"&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Valerius_Maximus/6*.html#1.10 Book 6, Chapter 1.10]&lt;/ref&gt; He was rewarded four times by his superiors to be the senior [[centurion]] of his [[Roman legion|legion]].&lt;ref name="page200110"/&gt; However Gaius Pescennius, a ''triumvir capitalis'' (prison manager) in CE 149, had Cornelius thrown in jail and shackled in irons for having sexual relations with a young boy of free birth.&lt;ref name="page200110"/&gt; Cornelius did not deny the charges and was prepared to make a ''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#sponsio|sponsio]]'' (legal guarantee).&lt;ref name="bk6110"/&gt; In so doing, Cornelius was making a statement and putting down a sum of money as a guarantee of truth.&lt;ref name="page200110"/&gt; If the guaranteed statement was found to be false, the young boy was to be paid this amount.&lt;ref name="page200110"/&gt; His statement was to say that the boy openly and willingly sold his body for cash.&lt;ref name="page200110"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bk6110"/&gt; The [[tribune]]s refused to allow this, since they thought soldiers of the Roman Republic should not make deals in which they could pay for pleasures at home by facing dangers overseas.&lt;ref name="page200110"/&gt; Cornelius spent the rest of his life in prison.&lt;ref name="page200110"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bk6110"/&gt;

In Book 6 Chapter 1.11 Valerius tells the story of Marcus Laetorius Mergus.&lt;ref name="page200111"&gt;Walker, Book 6, Chapter 1.11, p. 200&lt;/ref&gt; Cominius and a tribune of the [[pleb]]s summoned Mergus, a high-ranking military career person, before the people because of sexual relations with young men and women outside his marriage. He was prosecuted and sent to prison.&lt;ref name="page200111"/&gt;

In Book 6 Chapter 1.12 Valerius tells the story of [[Chiomara]].&lt;ref name="page202112"&gt;Walker, Book 6, Chapter 1. ext. 2, p. 201&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bk6ext2"&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Valerius_Maximus/6*.html#ext.2 Book 6, ext. 2]&lt;/ref&gt; Chiomara was the wife of Ortiagon. During the [[Galatian War]] with Rome of 189 BC, [[Gnaeus Manlius Vulso]] was victorious in a campaign against the Galatian Gauls.&lt;ref name="page202112"/&gt; One of his centurions was put in charge of a group of captives including Chiomara. The centurion made sexual advances towards her and she rejected him.&lt;ref name="page202112"/&gt; Under violence and force he raped her. The centurion then offered, to assuage his shame, to ransom her back to her relatives.&lt;ref name="page202112"/&gt; When he received his ransom and was counting the gold pieces, Chiomara secretly indicated to her relatives to murder him and cut off his head.&lt;ref name="bk6ext2"/&gt; She later presented the head of the centurion to her husband.&lt;ref name="page202112"/&gt;

===Political views===
[[File:Lucius Appuleius Saturninus.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Coin of [[Lucius Appuleius Saturninus]]]]
The political views of ordinary Romans basically were not written on by most ancient writers.&lt;ref name="rarely"&gt;Walker, P. xvii&lt;/ref&gt; Valerius, however, did write about the grassroots customs of Rome as a democratic society.&lt;ref name="rarely"/&gt; He points out that the poorer Romans had goals as to where they wanted to ultimately be and in what direction they wanted to go.&lt;ref name="rarely"/&gt;

One example of how political views were looked upon in his days is where he writes a story on [[Sextus Titus]], who kept a picture in his residence of a murdered [[Extremism|radical]] called [[Lucius Appuleius Saturninus]].&lt;ref name="stitus"&gt;Walker, p. 271&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bk81damn3"&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Valerius_Maximus/8*.html#1.damn.3 Book 8, Chapter 8.1.damn.3]&lt;/ref&gt; Titus was popular with the people because of a new land reform law he proposed; however, he was prosecuted and punished just because of the picture and his political views.&lt;ref name="stitus"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bk81damn3"/&gt; He writes that the Romans felt a personal loyalty to the memory of these reformers. The tribal assembly of [[plebeian]]s felt that this memory could be led astray if there was an association to a radical.&lt;ref name="rarely"/&gt;&lt;ref name="stitus"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bk81damn3"/&gt;

Many times there were [[imposter]]s that said they were sons of populist leaders like [[Tiberius]], [[Gaius Marius]], [[Gracchus]], and [[Publius Clodius Pulcher]]. The people of Rome loved them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Valerius_Maximus/9*.html#7.1 Book 9, Chapter 7.1 and 7.2]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Valerius_Maximus/9*.html#15.1 Book 9, Chapter 15. 1 -4]&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, he records that one claimed to be the grandson of Gaius Marius and drew a crowd as what [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]] himself would obtain.&lt;ref name="rarely"/&gt;

Valerius records the attitudes of the [[aristocracy]] and the contempt to which the [[Working class|lower class]] was subjected by the Roman elite. He demonstrates this with a story about [[Scipio Aemilianus Africanus]]. Scipio one day preached to a group of [[pleb]]s that basically they are nothing other than just a level above being slaves. He tells them they don't even deserve to call Italy their home.&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Valerius_Maximus/6*.html#2.3 Book 6, Chapter 6.2.3]&lt;/ref&gt; Valerius shows a similar concept with [[Publius Cornelius Scipio Nasica Serapio]]. The story goes that Nasica treated a poor man with ridicule and contempt because his hands were so rough from manual labor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Valerius_Maximus/7*.html#5.2 Book 7 Chapter 5.2]&lt;/ref&gt; Valerius writes of still another example where the aristocratic Claudia had hoped for more of the Roman common people to have been finished off in the [[First Punic War]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Valerius_Maximus/8*.html#1.damn.4 Book 8, Chapter 1.damn.4]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:EumenesII.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Coin of [[Eumenes II]]]]

===Generosity===
Valerius gives examples of generosity in Book 5 Chapter 8.&lt;ref name="gen1"&gt;Walker, p. 155&lt;/ref&gt; Valerius writes that generosity is given to those that are poor.&lt;ref name="kind1"&gt;Walker, p. 157&lt;/ref&gt; The Latin word for generosity is ''liberalitas''. The god of wine is Liber. The god Liber and the word ''liberalitas'' come from the word ''liber'', meaning "free." Here he tells the story of how, after the Romans captured Asia from King [[Antiochus III the Great]] in 190 BCE, they gave a large portion of it to their ally King [[Eumenes II]] of [[Pergamum]] free as a permanent gift.&lt;ref name="gen1"&gt;Walker, p. 155&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example of generosity which Valerius writes about occurs after the Romans had defeated [[Philip V of Macedonia]]. In 196 BCE, the Greeks had the [[Isthmian Games]]. Here [[Titus Quinctius Flamininus]] proclaimed the independence of the Greek states from [[Macedon]]ian rule.&lt;ref name="gen1"&gt;Walker, p. 155&lt;/ref&gt; At the games, the stadium was full of people and Titus had the herald make the following proclamation: "The Roman people and Senate, and Titus Quinctius Flamininus, their general, having vanquished the Macedonians and Philip, their king, order that Greece shall be free from foreign garrisons, not subject to tribute, and shall live under her own customs and laws."&lt;ref name="gen1"&gt;Walker, p. 155&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kindness and compassion===
The themes in Chapter 1 of Book 5 are [[kindness]] and [[compassion]]; Valerius gives several examples based on these concepts.&lt;ref name="kind1"&gt;Walker, p. 157&lt;/ref&gt; He considered these lesser [[virtue]]s than [[generosity]], although companions of it.&lt;ref name="kind1"&gt;Walker, p. 157&lt;/ref&gt; Valerius writes that kindness is shown to those that are in trouble and compassion is for those whose luck has turned against them.&lt;ref name="kind1"&gt;Walker, p. 157&lt;/ref&gt; He considered generosity to be the one that derived its name from a god, and should receive the most approval of these three.&lt;ref name="kind1"&gt;Walker, p. 157&lt;/ref&gt;

One Roman story is where Valerius gives an example of generosity, kindness and compassion. Here he explains that one day the [[Roman Senate]] was offered a large sum of ransom money for the release of 2,743 Carthaginian soldiers and refused it. The Senate released the soldiers to the representatives that had come to get them, and forgave the crimes. The representatives were astonished and even admitted that they themselves would not have been so kind and generous.&lt;ref name="kind1"&gt;Walker, p. 157&lt;/ref&gt;

Another Roman story in which Valerius writes about kindness is where king [[Syphax]] of western Numidia died in prison in Tibur (modern day [[Tivoli, Italy]]) in 201 BCE. The Senate gave him a state funeral with a proper burial.&lt;ref name="kind1"&gt;Walker, p. 157&lt;/ref&gt;

Another similar Roman story in which Valerius writes about compassion is where the Senate sent a [[quaestor]] to Alba (in [[Latium]]) in 167 BCE. There King [[Perseus]] of [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]] was banished to and had just died there. They wanted to give him honor and provided a state funeral for the king.&lt;ref name="kind1"&gt;Walker, p. 157&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Forum romanum 1880.jpg|thumb|[[Roman Forum]]]]

===Gratitude===
Valerius gives examples of gratitude in Book 5 Chapter 2 as the theme.&lt;ref name="grat1"&gt;Walker, p. 165&lt;/ref&gt; One example is when Valerius writes about how [[Capua]] was being besieged by [[Quintus Fulvius Flaccus]] at the [[first Battle of Capua]]; there were two Campanian women who had kind feelings for Rome. They devoted much of their time and property to its benefit.&lt;ref name="grat1"&gt;Walker, p. 165&lt;/ref&gt; One was Vestia Oppia, a married woman with a family, who labored everyday for the Roman army.&lt;ref name="grat1"&gt;Walker, p. 165&lt;/ref&gt; Another was Cluvia Facula, a prostitute, who supplied food to the Roman [[prisoners of war]].&lt;ref name="grat1"&gt;Walker, p. 165&lt;/ref&gt; When Capua was defeated, the Roman Senate gave back their freedom and property and rewarded them. These two momen were even praised at an important Senate meeting in 210 BCE.&lt;ref name="grat1"&gt;Walker, p. 165&lt;/ref&gt;

Valerius gives another example of gratitude when he writes of [[Quintus Fabius Maximus Verrucosus]] (c. 280 BC – 203 BC), called '''Cunctator''' (''the Delayer'').&lt;ref name="grat2"&gt;Walker, p. 166&lt;/ref&gt; Fabius died in 203 BCE after being [[Roman consul|consul]] for five terms. Many people of Rome generously gave money to his funeral in gratitude for his leadership.&lt;ref name="grat2"&gt;Walker, p. 166&lt;/ref&gt; When he was still alive, to show gratitude of his outstanding service to the Roman people, a [[referendum]] of the [[pleb]]s gave equal power to his [[magister equitum]] [[Marcus Minucius Rufus (consul 221 BC)|Marcus Minucius Rufus]] as co-dictator in 217 BCE.&lt;ref name="grat2"&gt;Walker, p. 166&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Carthage location 2.png|thumb|left|[[Carthage]] location]]

===Ingratitude===
Valerius gives as the theme "ingratitude" in Book 4 Chapter 3. Valerius writes that [[Scipio Aemilianus]], grandson of famous general [[Scipio Africanus]], had destroyed two major cities, [[Numantia]] and [[Carthage]], that were major threats to Rome. However, in Rome later, he met his death in mysterious circumstances in 129 BCE.&lt;ref name="myster"&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Valerius_Maximus/4*.html#1.12 Book 4, Chapter 1.12]&lt;/ref&gt; There was never anyone in the [[Roman Forum]] that avenged his death.&lt;ref name="myster"/&gt;

Valerius writes of another example on ingratitude being the circumstances around [[Publius Cornelius Scipio Nasica Serapio]]. Nasica had led a group of conservative senators of the Roman Senate to kill the populist tribune of the plebs [[Tiberius Gracchus]] in 133 BCE.&lt;ref name="merit"&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Valerius_Maximus/3*.html#2.17 Book 3, Chapter 2.17]&lt;/ref&gt; He soon afterward had to withdraw from public life because the people of Rome had judged his merits unfairly.&lt;ref name="merit"/&gt; Nasica, a [[Pontifex Maximus]], went to [[Pergamum]] ostensibly as a [[diplomat]] and never returned.&lt;ref name="merit"/&gt; He died there, but never missed his country because the Roman people were so ungrateful for what he considered a great deed he had done for them.&lt;ref name="merit"/&gt;

[[File:Gaius Gracchus Tribune of the People.jpg|thumb|right|The [[rostra]] at the Roman Forum]]

===Infamous crimes===
On another theme, Valerius writes of several examples of infamous crimes in Book 8 Chapter 1 and how they related to [[jealousy]].&lt;ref name="absol2"&gt;Walker, p. 266&lt;/ref&gt;

One example Valerius records of acquittal ''(absoluti)'' is where Marcus Horatius is found guilty by King [[Tullus Hostilius]] of killing his sister.&lt;ref name="abs811"&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Valerius_Maximus/8*.html#1.abs.1 Book 8 Chapter 1.abs.1]&lt;/ref&gt; Horatius was acquitted of the crime when he appealed to the public.&lt;ref name="abs811"/&gt; The brutal nature of the killing influenced King Tullus to convict him; however, the motive for which Horatius did it influenced the people.&lt;ref name="abs811"/&gt; In a battle defending Rome Horatius defeated the Curiatius brothers and killed them. His sister was in love with one of these brothers and planned on marrying him.&lt;ref name="abs811"/&gt; She wept over him, hearing of his death. Horatius murdered her then because of her premature love affair with the enemy.&lt;ref name="abs811"/&gt; The people of Rome felt this was harsh punishment rather than an actual crime of the Roman Republic. Horatius received glory for not only killing the Curiatius brothers, the enemy, but for killing his sister.&lt;ref name="abs811"/&gt; In this case the Roman people were acting as a strict guardian of chastity.&lt;ref name="absol2"&gt;Walker, p. 266&lt;/ref&gt;

Another case Valerius records is where the Roman people were acting as an unfair, lax judge. In this case [[Servius Sulpicius Galba (consul 144 BC)|Servius Sulpicius Galba]] was being harshly denounced at the [[rostra]] by [[Lucius Scribonius Libo]], tribune of the plebs in 149 BCE.&lt;ref name="absol2"&gt;Walker, p. 266&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cato the Elder]] supported the tribune's charges in a grand speech at a [[Roman assemblies|Roman assembly]] as is recorded in his ''Origins''.&lt;ref name="absol2"&gt;Walker, p. 266&lt;/ref&gt; Galba had committed an atrocious [[war crime]] against the [[Lusitanians]]. He had made a peace agreement with the Lusitanians, but then massacred 8,000 of them while he was governor of [[Hispania|Spain]] in 150 BCE.&lt;ref name="absol2"&gt;Walker, p. 266&lt;/ref&gt; Galba, being a great speaker in his own right, had no real defense for his crimes. Through bribery and bringing forth his children and the orphan child of a relative before the public in a speech for mercy, he procured his acquittal.&lt;ref name="absol2"&gt;Walker, p. 266&lt;/ref&gt;

Another case where Valerius records ancient history crimes is about Gaius Cosconius, [[praetor]] in 89 BCE and governor of [[Illyria]] from 78 to 76 BCE.&lt;ref name="acquit1"&gt;Walker, p. 268&lt;/ref&gt; He was accused of misgovernment under the [[Servilian Law]] passed in 101 BCE.&lt;ref name="acquit1"&gt;Walker, p. 268&lt;/ref&gt; There was no doubt that he was guilty; however, he recited a poem about his accuser, Valerius Valentinus, and got an acquittal.&lt;ref name="acquit1"&gt;Walker, p. 268&lt;/ref&gt; The poem was about how Valerius seduced a young man in a striped [[toga]] and a young freeborn woman. Valerius was then convicted by the acquittal of Cosconius.&lt;ref name="acquit1"&gt;Walker, p. 268&lt;/ref&gt;

===Outrageous behavior===
Valerius reports in Book 9 Chapter 5 under Foreign Stories that [[Alexander the Great]] had three stages of arrogance.&lt;ref name="alex"&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Valerius_Maximus/9*.html#5.ext.1 Book 9 Chapter 5.ext.1]&lt;/ref&gt; One was that he looked down on his father [[Philip II of Macedon]] and claimed that Jupiter Hammon was his real father.&lt;ref name="alex"/&gt; Another was that he took up the ways of the [[Persian people]] by dressing and behaving their way.&lt;ref name="alex"/&gt; Still another was that Alexander believed himself to be a god, not a human being.&lt;ref name="alex"/&gt;

Valerius writes another foreign story here of [[Xerxes I of Persia]].&lt;ref name="xerxes"&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Valerius_Maximus/9*.html#5.ext.2 Book 9 Chapter 5.ext.2]&lt;/ref&gt; To show his outrageous behavior and arrogance, he tells how Xerxes summoned all the leaders of Asia together.&lt;ref name="xerxes"/&gt; Just as he was about to declare war on Greece, he tells them, ''I did not want people to think that I was acting on my own initiative, so I brought you together here. But remember that it is your duty to obey me rather than persuade me.''&lt;ref name="xerxes"/&gt; Valerius reports that in the invasion, Xerxes suffered such a defeat that one would wonder if his words were just arrogance or stupidity.&lt;ref name="xerxes"/&gt;

Valerius writes on still another foreign story of [[Hannibal]] and how arrogant he was after his success at the [[Battle of Cannae]].&lt;ref name="hannibal"&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Valerius_Maximus/9*.html#5.ext.3 Book 9 Chapter 5.ext.3]&lt;/ref&gt; He tells how Hannibal had [[delusions of grandeur]] and would not then receive any of his fellow citizens directly. He would only communicate through a go-between.&lt;ref name="hannibal"/&gt; He even insulted his cavalry commander Maharbal, who had said in front of his tent in a loud voice that he had planned things so that Hannibal would be dining on the Capitol in Rome within a few days.&lt;ref name="hannibal"/&gt;

==Other topics==
Some other subjects that Valerius wrote about included:
*Bravery
*Cruelty
*Dreams
*Fidelity
*Friendship
*Innate characteristics
*Moderation
*Modesty
*Omens
*Parental Love
*Physical resemblance
*Prestige

[[File:Radical feminist graffit spain.jpg|right|thumb|Feminist stencil graffiti in Spain, 2013: "without you, I am me"]]
'''Female graffiti artists''' are an active part in [[Hip hop#Graffiti|hip hop graffiti]] writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lombard|first1=Kara-Jane|title=Men against the wall: Graffiti(ed) masculinities|journal=Journal of Men Studies|volume=21|issue=2013|pages=178–190}}&lt;/ref&gt; Female graffiti artists can face challenges of overt [[sexism]] and sexual assault from fellow artists while executing their work. Examples of female graffiti artists include [[Lady Pink]], Charmin 65, and [[Tatyana Fazlalizadeh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kelley|first1=Robin D.|title=Yo' Mama's Disfunktional!: Fighting the Culture Wars in Urban America|date=1997|publisher=Beacon Press|location=Boston}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Female graffiti writers and street artists use [[Glossary of graffiti|murals, pieces, tags]], and [[street art]] to display their artwork and make their voices heard.

==Sexism in graffiti==
Women tend to be frequently hypersexualized and [[marginalized]] in [[hip hop]], which also extends to the hip hop graffiti subculture.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pabón|first1=Jessica N.|title=The Art of Getting Ovaries: Female Graffiti Artists and the Politics of Presence in Hip Hop's Graffiti Subculture|date=|issue=NYC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Female graffiti artists can often be sexualized, tokenized, and marginalized, which scholar Jessica Pabón feels can breed "a culture of misogyny" and can also lead to the oppression of female graffiti artists.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This ideology can also shape how female artists relate to other female writers and how they see themselves as the weaker writer or as a means to gain sexual attention from males.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Representation in graffiti art ==
Although female writers exist in the [[subculture]] of graffiti, their work tends to be more infrequently seen and acknowledged as that of their male counterparts, something that some artists feel mirrors the lack of [[Femininity|feminine]] representation in the [[art world]].&lt;ref name="Caldwell"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hyperallergic.com/188992/why-arent-women-street-artists-just-street-artists/|title=Why Aren't "Women Street Artists" Just "Street Artists"?|website=Hyperallergic|last1=Caldwell|first1=Caroline|accessdate=9 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, female artists can sometimes voluntary or involuntary become part of the [[Feminist activism in hip hop#Graffiti|feminist movement in graffiti]], as well as the [[feminist art movement]] by bringing their femininity.

==Activism and feminist graffiti communities==
In response to the perceived [[patriarchy]] of graffiti, female graffiti artists in locations such as Chile and Brazil are forming all-female crews where new female artists are given a positive space with support, mentoring and friendship.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pabón|first=Jessica|year=2013|title=Be about it: Graffiteras performing feminist community|url=|journal=The Drama Review|volume=3|pages=88–115|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These communities feel that by re-claiming space through graffiti they are "[protesting] her invisibility" and "[claiming] space in a subculture where the walls 'belong' to men".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Some female graffiti artists use activism to combat topics such as [[street harassment]], as in the case of street artist [[Tatyana Fazlalizadeh]]'s Stop Telling Women To Smile campaign, which uses posters to empower women and show that catcalling is not acceptable.&lt;ref name="Caldwell" /&gt; Of the campaign, Fazlaizadeh has stated that she wants women to re-claim their public space as "(...) women are not outside on the street for the purpose of entertaining and pleasing men".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Yong|first1=John|title=Street Art to Combat Street Harassment Faced by Women|url=http://designtaxi.com/news/356559/Street-Art-To-%20Combat-Street-Harassment-Faced-By-Women/|date=15 March 2013|website=Designtaxi|accessdate=30 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Figure–ground organization''' is a type of perceptual grouping which is a vital necessity for recognizing objects through vision. In [[Gestalt psychology]] it is known as identifying a ''figure'' from the back''ground''. For example, you see words on a printed paper as the "figure" and the white sheet as the "background".&lt;ref&gt;Schacter, Daniel L., Daniel T. Gilbert, and Daniel M. Wegner. "Chapter 4: Sensation and Perception, Vision II: Recognizing What We Perceive." Psychology. ; Second Edition. N.p.: Worth, Incorporated, 2011. 149-50. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
The most famous example of figure–ground perception is probably the [[Rubin vase|faces–vase drawing that Danish psychologist Edgar Rubin described]].&lt;ref&gt;Rubin, E. (1921) ''Visuell Wahrgenommene Figuren : Studien in psychologischer Analyse''. Kobenhaven: Gyldendalske boghandel.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rubin, E. (2001). Figure and Ground. In Yantis, S.(Ed.), ''Visual Perception''. (pp. 225-229). Philadelphia, Psychology Press&lt;/ref&gt; This drawing exemplifies one of the key aspects of figure–ground organization, edge-assignment and its effect on shape perception. Notice in the faces/vase drawing, the perceived shape depends critically on the direction in which the border (edge) between the black and white regions is assigned. If the two curvy edges between the black and white regions are assigned inward then the central white region is seen as a vase shape in front of a black background. No faces are perceived in this case. On the other hand, if the edges are assigned outwards, then the two black profile faces are perceived on a white background and no vase shape is perceived. The human visual system will then settle on either of the interpretations of the Rubin vase and alternate between them. Functional brain imaging shows that when people see the Rubin image as a face, there is activity in the temporal lobe, specifically in the face-selective region &lt;ref&gt;Schacter, L.D., Gilbert, D.T., Wegner, D.M. (2011). "Psychology (2nd ed.)." New York, NY: Worth Publishers&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hasson, U., Hendler, T., Ben Bashat, D., and Malach, R. (2001). Vase or face? A neural correlate of shape-selective grouping processes in the human brain. J. Cogn. Neurosci. 13, 744–753.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Perceptual process==
How does the brain decide in a visual scene which item is the figure and which are part of the ground? This perceptual decision can be based on many cues, all of which are of a probabilistic nature. For instance, size helps us distinguish between the figure and the ground, since smaller regions are often (but not always) figures. Object shape can help us distinguish figure from ground, because figures tend to be convex. Movement also helps; the figure may be moving against a static environment. Color is also a cue, because the background tends to continue as one color behind potentially multiple foreground figures, whose colors may vary. Edge assignment also helps; if the edge belongs to the figure, it defines the shape while the background exists behind the shape. But it's at times difficult to distinguish between the two because the edge that would separate figure from ground is really part of neither, it equally defines both the figure and the background.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Evidently, the process of distinguishing figure from ground (sometimes called figure–ground segmentation) is inherently probabilistic, and the best that the brain can do is to take all relevant cues into account in order to generate a probabilistic best-guess. In this light, [[Bayesian approaches to brain function|Bayesian]] figure–ground segmentation models have been proposed to simulate the probabilistic inference by which the brain may distinguish figure from ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Goldreich|first=D|author2=Peterson, MA|title=A Bayesian observer replicates convexity context effects in figure–ground perception.|journal=Seeing and perceiving|year=2012|volume=25|issue=3-4|pages=365–95|pmid=22564398|doi=10.1163/187847612X634445}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Barghout|first=L|author2=Lee, L|title=Perceptual information processing system.|journal=USPatent Patent Application 10/618,543,|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Artistic applications==
Figure–ground organization is used to help artists and designers in composition of a 2D piece. Figure–ground reversal may be used as an intentional [[visual design]] technique in which an existing image's foreground and background colors are purposely swapped to create new images.

==Non-visual==
Figure–ground perception can be expanded from visual perception to include abstract (i.e. non-visual) concepts such as melody/harmony, subject/background and positive/negative space.{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=October 2016}} The concept of figure and ground fully depends on the observer and not on the item itself.&lt;ref name="figure and ground"&gt;{{cite book |last=Carlson |first=Neil R |title=Psychology the science of behaviour-figure and ground |year=2010 |publisher=Pearson Canada |location=USA |isbn=978-0-205-64524-4 |pages=175}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of figure–ground problems==
[[File:Star-jeans.jpg|thumb|Type 2: The actual ground is the figure.]]
There are three types of figure–ground problems:
#The figure and the ground compete.
#The figure should be the ground and the ground should be the figure.
#The figure and ground create an [[optical illusion]].&lt;ref&gt;Lohr L. Creating Graphics for Learning and Performance: Lessons in Visual Literacy Cleveland, OH: Prentice-Hall, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Francisc Iosif Rainer''' (December 28, 1874 – August 4, 1944) was an [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]]-born [[Romania]]n pathologist, physiologist and anthropologist. From an immigrant family, he earned early recognition for his experimental work in anatomy, and helped reform Romanian medical science. He spent much of his youth training himself in [[anatomical pathology]] and the various areas of [[natural science]], gaining direct experience as a microbiologist, surgeon, and military physician. With teaching positions at the [[Alexandru Ioan Cuza University|University of Iași]] and the [[University of Bucharest]], where he established specialized sections, Rainer became a noted promoter of science and an innovator in his field. He notably favored and introduced the anatomical study of "functional structures", and was in particular preoccupied with issues pertaining to [[ontogenesis]] and [[kinesiology]]. An intellectual influence on several generations of doctors, his wife was [[Marta Trancu-Rainer]], Romania's first female surgeon.

In addition to his experimental approach, Rainer is remembered as a talented pedagogue and public speaker, who took public stances in defense of his social and cultural ideals. Vilified by the far-right for his left-wing stances, he blended [[progressivism]] with [[genetic determinism]], and, although an adept of [[eugenics]], condemned [[scientific racism]]. He was notably involved with [[Dimitrie Gusti]]'s project of [[rural sociology]], contributing an anthropological record of several isolated villages on the [[Carpathians|Carpathian]] slopes. During his lifetime, Rainer also set up a large collection of craniums and skeletons, which became the centerpiece of his Bucharest anthropology department.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Francisc Rainer was a native of [[Sadhora|Rohozna]] town, near [[Chernivtsi|Czernowitz]], in [[Crown land|Austrian-ruled]] [[Bukovina]]. His parents were [[Lutheran]], but baptized their son [[Roman Catholic]].&lt;ref name="z155"&gt;Zamfirescu, p.155&lt;/ref&gt; His father, Gustav Adolf Ignatz Rainer, emigrated to the [[Romanian Old Kingdom]] as an employee of the [[Bethel Henry Strousberg|Strousberg Company]] that built the [[Bucharest]]-[[Giurgiu]] railway, the country's first. Remaining there, he obtained a post in the administration of the [[Căile Ferate Române|national railroad company]].&lt;ref&gt;Riga &amp; Călin, pp.21–22; Zamfirescu, p.155&lt;/ref&gt; His mother Maria (or Ana) came from a clerical family,&lt;ref name="z155"/&gt; and was a housewife.&lt;ref name="r&amp;c22"&gt;Riga &amp; Călin, p.22&lt;/ref&gt; The boy received his primary education at home from his parents, later attending [[Saint Sava National College]] in Bucharest. Among the teachers who were particularly helpful was [[Sabba Ștefănescu]] in natural sciences.&lt;ref&gt;Riga &amp; Călin, pp.23–24; Zamfirescu, p.155&lt;/ref&gt; Rainer read extensively, teaching himself [[Latin]] and [[Ancient Greek]], and becoming passionate about the literary works of [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]] and the philosophy of [[Arthur Schopenhauer]]. He slowly discarded the latter's influence when he discovered [[Heraclitus]], [[Ernst Haeckel]], and classical [[Materialism|materialistic]] thought.&lt;ref&gt;Riga &amp; Călin, pp.16–18, 22–26, 40, 121&lt;/ref&gt; Such works diverted him from his original goal of becoming a [[Catholic missions|Catholic missionary]].&lt;ref name="r&amp;c22"/&gt;

In 1892, he enrolled in the medical faculty of the University of Bucharest. While still a student, Rainer was given important tasks by a professor in his [[histology|histological]] laboratory. In 1896, he was named a junior teaching assistant in the medical clinic at [[Colțea Hospital]]; he remained there for nearly two decades.&lt;ref&gt;Majuru, pp.281–282; Riga &amp; Călin, pp.24, 28–32, 177; Zamfirescu, p.155&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, troubled by "the great issues of the Cosmos", he imposed on himself a rigorous program of study and exercise (including cycling, mountaineering and [[fencing]]).&lt;ref name="amaj282"&gt;Majuru, p.282&lt;/ref&gt; Although struggling to make ends meet, Rainer deepened his anatomical research, closely studying human morphology, and experimented with examination techniques during [[Autopsy|autopsies]], founding a Romanian Anatomical Society for the purpose of sharing results.&lt;ref&gt;Riga &amp; Călin, pp.29–32, 38–39, 137&lt;/ref&gt; He also attended [[Anghel Saligny]]'s lectures in chemistry at the [[Politehnica University of Bucharest|School of Bridges]], worked as a chemist in [[Constantin Istrati]]'s lab, then as a pathologist at the [[University of Agronomic Sciences and Veterinary Medicine|Veterinary School]].&lt;ref&gt;Riga &amp; Călin, pp.33, 35&lt;/ref&gt; He moved between Colțea, [[Filaret Hospital|Filaret]] and the school of assistant surgeons, taking part in the campaign against [[tuberculosis]].&lt;ref&gt;Riga &amp; Călin, pp.36, 177&lt;/ref&gt; In the summers of 1900 and 1901, he took part in an anti-[[cholera]] campaign in the [[Danube Delta]], which also allowed him to study the native flora and fauna.&lt;ref&gt;Hînganu, p.158; Riga &amp; Călin, p.35&lt;/ref&gt;

He completed his doctorate in 1903, the topic being a particular form of [[cirrhosis]]. Having performed numerous autopsies at the hospital, he made an original discovery himself; at the end of the thesis committee's debate, two of its members, Dr. Stoicescu from Colțea and [[Victor Babeș]], extended their collegial greetings to Rainer.&lt;ref name="z155"/&gt; Aside from this pair, his professors included [[Alexandru Obregia]], [[Nicolae Kalinderu]], [[Thoma Ionescu]], [[Gheorghe Marinescu]], [[Ioan Cantacuzino]] and [[Mina Minovici]].&lt;ref&gt;Hînganu, p.157; Riga &amp; Călin, pp.24, 26–28, 35, 38–39&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 1903, Rainer, recently [[Romanian nationality law|naturalized Romanian]], married [[Marta Trancu-Rainer|Marta Trancu]], an [[Armenians in Romania|Armenian Romanian]] doctor who had worked with him at Colțea.&lt;ref name="anmarta1"&gt;{{ro icon}} Anaïs Nersesian, [http://www.araratonline.com/PDF/Ararat/2006/Ararat%2002-2006.pdf "O personalitate a medicinei românești. Doctor Marta Trancu Rainer (1)"], in ''Ararat'', n.2/2006, p.4&lt;/ref&gt; They had corresponded intensely on scientific and cultural subjects, before becoming romantically involved.&lt;ref&gt;Riga &amp; Călin, pp.32–34&lt;/ref&gt; After completing her studies, Marta became Romania's first female surgeon.&lt;ref&gt;[[Nicolae Iorga]], ''Corespondență'', vol.3, p.143. [[Editura Minerva]], Bucharest, 1991, {{ISBN|978-973210-168-1}}; Riga &amp; Călin, pp.31–34, 35–36&lt;/ref&gt; Their only child, daughter Sofia, was born on in May 1904.&lt;ref name="anmarta1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Riga &amp; Călin, pp.35–36&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:N. Minovici și Rainer, necropsie, ca. 1900.jpg|thumb|380px|Intern Rainer (in dark suit, perched) witnessing an [[autopsy]] performed by [[Nicolae Minovici]], ''ca.'' 1900]]
During that period, Rainer made two visits to [[German Empire|Germany]]. The first, in 1906, involved work at [[Berlin]]'s [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Frederick William University]] in the laboratories of [[Fedor Krause]] and [[Oscar Hertwig]], as well as a study of [[embryology]] and [[comparative anatomy]]. His animal experiments there were primarily focused on the [[ossification]] process. At the anatomical institute led by [[Heinrich Wilhelm Gottfried von Waldeyer-Hartz|Heinrich Wilhelm Waldeyer]], he analyzed the brains of individuals belonging to different races.&lt;ref&gt;Riga &amp; Călin, pp.37–38, 107, 109; Hînganu, p.158&lt;/ref&gt; The second visit, in 1911, involved a stop at the [[German Hygiene Museum]] in [[Dresden]], at the anatomy institute of the [[University of Jena]] and at [[Leipzig]]. Near the trip's conclusion, while in [[Weimar]], he visited [[Goethe House (Weimar)|Goethe's House]].&lt;ref&gt;Hînganu, p.158; Riga &amp; Călin, pp.39–40&lt;/ref&gt;

===Iași career and World War I===
Upon his return in 1912, Rainer became assistant professor at Bucharest.&lt;ref name="z155"/&gt; The following year, with referrals from [[Constantin Ion Parhon]],&lt;ref&gt;Riga &amp; Călin, p.46&lt;/ref&gt; he became chairman of the anatomy department at the University of Iași medical faculty. Soon after his appointment, with the outbreak of the [[Second Balkan War]], he was mobilized in the [[Romanian Land Forces]] medical service. He barely escaped with his life when his automobile fell off the [[pontoon bridge]] at [[Nikopol, Bulgaria|Nikopol]].&lt;ref&gt;Riga &amp; Călin, p.47&lt;/ref&gt; Upon his return, he busied himself with organizing his Iași department, supplying the microscopes, microtomes, thermostats, magazine collections and a projector for the faculty.&lt;ref&gt;Hînganu, p.158; Riga &amp; Călin, p.47&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, during this period, he was involved in scientific publication, sitting on the editorial board of ''Spitalul'', writing for ''Romania Medicală'' and, in 1911, helping found the Paris-based ''Annales de Biologie''.&lt;ref&gt;Hînganu, p.158; Riga &amp; Călin, p.39&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Marta Rainer's own account, her husband's move to Iași at age forty marked the end of a "prolonged adolescence", settling Rainer on the path to professional success.&lt;ref&gt;Majuru, p.281&lt;/ref&gt; As Rainer himself noted, teaching was a major responsibility: "I have always held the belief that there is no feeling so great, no thought so vast and deep, that they may not reach out to young minds and hearts."&lt;ref&gt;Majuru, p.281; Riga &amp; Călin, p.93&lt;/ref&gt; He set for himself the goal of answering to some of "the great issues of mankind", with "a prolonged action to strengthen my spirit."&lt;ref&gt;Riga &amp; Călin, pp.47–48&lt;/ref&gt; In his university lectures, Rainer taught that the purpose of medical science was human progress, "that we may always reach for something that is set higher".&lt;ref&gt;Vitner, p.104&lt;/ref&gt; He also held that "each of us owes more to society than society owes us."&lt;ref&gt;Majuru, p.288; Riga &amp; Călin, pp.90–91&lt;/ref&gt;

While in Iași, Rainer joined the left-wing literary circle formed around ''[[Viața Românească]]'' magazine, for which he contributed notes on medical science.&lt;ref&gt;Riga &amp; Călin, pp.62–63&lt;/ref&gt; He befriended the group's doyen, [[Garabet Ibrăileanu]], whom he treated for his lung problems. Rainer persuaded Ibrăileanu, who was Marta's cousin,&lt;ref&gt;Riga &amp; Călin, pp.60–61&lt;/ref&gt; to hold courses in Romanian language and literature two evenings a week for medical students. His intention was to develop cultured doctors, and the students heard lectures by [[Mihail Sadoveanu]], [[George Topîrceanu]] and [[Titu Maiorescu]].&lt;ref&gt;Hînganu, p.158; Riga &amp; Călin, pp.61–62&lt;/ref&gt; He also took them for nature excursions so they could observe biological phenomena outside the laboratory.&lt;ref name="h158"&gt;Hînganu, p.158&lt;/ref&gt; Rainer himself traveled extensively after 1914: among his earliest trips was a working visit to [[Odón de Buen y del Cos|Odón de Buen]]'s oceanographic institute in [[Palma, Majorca|Palma de Mallorca]].&lt;ref&gt;Hînganu, p.158; Riga &amp; Călin, p.64&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1916, following Romania's entry into [[World War I]], Rainer returned to Bucharest and rejoined Marta, being called up for medical service as a Colonel.&lt;ref&gt;Riga &amp; Călin, p.67&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Romania during World War I|1916 counteroffensive]], the Rainers set up surgery wards in the hospitals that had become full to overflowing with wounded from the [[Battle of Turtucaia]] and the [[zeppelin]] attack on Bucharest.&lt;ref&gt;Hînganu, pp.158–159; Riga &amp; Călin, pp.65–67&lt;/ref&gt; Later, during Bucharest's occupation by the [[Central Powers]], Francisc Rainer established temporary hospitals in schools. He continued teaching under the German administration, so that his students would not miss a year, but was also obliged to teach separate courses for German students. He managed to prevent the occupying authorities from requisitioning the faculty's possessions.&lt;ref&gt;Hînganu, pp.158–159; Riga &amp; Călin, pp.68–70&lt;/ref&gt; Viewed as political suspects, the Rainers were singled out for [[internment]] in [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]], but spared by Minovici's intervention on his behalf.&lt;ref&gt;Riga &amp; Călin, pp.69, 72&lt;/ref&gt; Marta Rainer, who managed war hospitals, organized teams of surgeons to help deal with the humanitarian crisis, and operated non-stop during the extremely cold winter of 1917–1918.&lt;ref name="anmarta3"&gt;{{ro icon}} Anaïs Nersesian, [http://www.araratonline.com/PDF/Ararat/2006/Ararat%2004-2006.pdf "O personalitate a medicinei românești. Doctor Marta Trancu Rainer (3)"], in ''Ararat'', n.4/2006, p.6&lt;/ref&gt;

Following [[Treaty of Bucharest (1918)|Romania's withdrawal from the war]], Rainer resumed his contacts with Romanian physicians stranded on unoccupied territory. His wartime work in experimental surgery attracted young men and women, including some of his former students at Iași. They included [[Grigore T. Popa]], who was selected for Rainer's permanent team during 1918.&lt;ref&gt;Hînganu, p.159; Popa, p.230; Riga &amp; Călin, pp.69–70&lt;/ref&gt; Other early members were Florica Cernătescu (Popa's fiancée) and Ilie Th. Riga.&lt;ref&gt;Riga &amp; Călin, pp.69–70, 180&lt;/ref&gt; By late 1918, Rainer was conceiving of an education reform, aiming to compress theoretical aspects and "routine" work while providing students with as much laboratory experience as possible. His ideas were received with skepticism by the physiologist [[Ioan Athanasiu]], who stood for the classical approach.&lt;ref&gt;Riga &amp; Călin, pp.111–113&lt;/ref&gt;

For a while in 1919, Rainer made a return to teaching in Iași, where he also resumed his activity in the fight against tuberculosis.&lt;ref&gt;Riga &amp; Călin, pp.72–75&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[First Armistice at Compiègne|Armistice of November]] signaled a worldwide return to peace, Rainer had to fend off allegations and angry students demonstrations, with allegations that he had been a turncoat and a collaborator of the Germans. During 1919, a commission of inquiry cleared his name, noting that he had displayed "absolute loyalty" to the legitimate Romanian government.&lt;ref&gt;Riga &amp; Călin, pp.70–71&lt;/ref&gt; He himself vouched for his colleague [[Ecaterina Arbore]], arrested for her revolutionary socialist militancy.&lt;ref&gt;Riga &amp; Călin, p.73&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[1920 Romanian general strike|general strike of 1920]] was broken up by the authorities, Rainer was part of the investigative commission which determined that the labor organizer [[Herșcu Aroneanu]] had been beaten to death.&lt;ref&gt;Riga &amp; Călin, pp.74–75&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bucharest school of anatomy creation===
[[File:Rainer cu vertebre, 1926.jpg|thumb|270px|Rainer in his lab, with a specimen of [[cervical vertebrae]] (1926)]]
In 1920, Rainer was employed by the new anatomy and embryology department set up at Bucharest University. Afflicted by deafness, attributed to his long-term exposure to [[formaldehyde]], he continued to work at the same pace, but was noticeably withdrawn from public life.&lt;ref&gt;Riga &amp; Călin, pp.19–20&lt;/ref&gt; The anatomy section existed only in name when Rainer took over. Rainer took personal charge of furnishing it, in the end setting up a large collection of craniums and full skeletons that earned the respect of Western colleagues such as [[Eugène Pittard]],&lt;ref&gt;Bucur, p.78&lt;/ref&gt; [[Carleton S. Coon]], [[Henri Victor Vallois]], and [[Kurt Warnekros]].&lt;ref&gt;Riga &amp; Călin, pp.85–86, 150–151&lt;/ref&gt; He was seconded by his devoted disciple and godson, the endocrinologist [[Ștefan Milcu]] (he eventually left Rainer's team in 1932, after developing an allergy to formaldehyde).&lt;ref&gt;Bălăceanu-Stolnici, pp.11–12, 13&lt;/ref&gt; Other important presences among Rainer's students and collaborators were [[George Emil Palade]]&lt;ref&gt;Riga &amp; Călin, p.19, 186&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mnbnegru"&gt;{{ro icon}} Mihai Neagu Basarab, [http://www.viata-medicala.ro/Dr.-Natalia-Neagu.html*articleID_6341-dArt.html "Dr. Natalia Neagu"], in ''Viața Medicală'', n.3/2013&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Vintilă Ciocâlteu]],&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} C. D. Zeletin, [http://www.romlit.ro/vintil_cioclteu "Vintilă Ciocâlteu"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', n.6/2002&lt;/ref&gt; distinguished for their work in the United States. At various intervals, the team also included surgeon [[Ion Țurai]], pharmacologist [[Alfred Teitel]], embryologist [[Benedict M. Menkeș]], and anatomist [[Zalman Iagnov]].&lt;ref name="mnbnegru"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Riga &amp; Călin, pp.19, 129–130, 185–186; {{ro icon}} Francisc Schneider, [http://www.jewishfed.ro/downloads/realitatea/RE360-361.pdf "Evocări timișorene"], in ''[[Realitatea Evreiască]]'', n.360–361/2011, p.4&lt;/ref&gt;

After his move, Rainer began expanding the scope of his contribution, and passed on to his students a particular view of science, decisively materialistic, [[Rationalism|rationalist]], and anti-[[Metaphysics|metaphysical]].&lt;ref&gt;Brătescu, p.102, 154; Riga &amp; Călin, pp.16–18, 43–46, 81–82, 90–93, 96–97, 110, 156–192; Vitner, pp.101–102, 105–106&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, Rainer rejected the [[Intuition (Bergson)|intuitionism]] of [[Henri Bergson]], which had enjoyed a surge in popularity.&lt;ref&gt;Vitner, p.107&lt;/ref&gt; His intellectual heroes and models of researchers included [[Claude Bernard]], [[Rudolf Virchow]], and especially Goethe.&lt;ref&gt;Majuru, p.287, 289; Riga &amp; Călin, pp.16, 18, 64, 110, 113, 122–123, 125–128, 131–132, 178&lt;/ref&gt; The physician and left-wing political figure [[Ion Vitner]] writes that Rainer's understanding of the human body, heavily influenced by the work of [[Wilhelm Roux]], centered on "life", "movement", "function", and ultimately "[[ontogenesis]]", rather than on the "static catalog" of 19th-century anatomy.&lt;ref&gt;Vitner, pp.102–104. See also Bălăceanu-Stolnici, p.13; Majuru, p.285; Riga &amp; Călin, pp.83–84, 103, 106–139&lt;/ref&gt;

This worldview seeped into Rainer's research, which assumed the existence of a "precise genetic program" in man's [[Somatic effort|somatic development]].&lt;ref&gt;Bălăceanu-Stolnici, p.13&lt;/ref&gt; He centered his attention on correlating the activities of various organs and their understanding as "functional structures".&lt;ref&gt;Majuru, p.285; Riga &amp; Călin, pp.129–139; Vitner, pp.104–106&lt;/ref&gt; This helped him and his students make groundbreaking discoveries in area such as the [[dura mater]], [[cranial nerves]], the [[lateral aortic lymph nodes]], and the [[hypophyseal portal system]].&lt;ref&gt;Riga &amp; Călin, pp.137–139; Vitner, pp.104–106&lt;/ref&gt; In his study of [[spondylopathy]], Rainer personally documented the existence of [[arthritis]] in the [[Atlas (anatomy)|atlas]].&lt;ref&gt;Riga &amp; Călin, p.138&lt;/ref&gt;

Physician I. Spielmann describes Rainer admiringly as a "[[Polymath|polyhistor]]" with "a passionate image of what truth is".&lt;ref&gt;Majuru, p.287&lt;/ref&gt; According to a student, the historian of medicine [[G. Brătescu]], Rainer was an outstanding pedagogue and public speaker, whose anatomy lessons were highly inspirational, but whose neglect for his public appearance could alienate young people.&lt;ref&gt;Brătescu, pp.74, 95, 97, 98, 101, 154, 285&lt;/ref&gt; As he writes: "After showing us that medical science is one of observation, but that in practice it involves continuous experimentation, and why it is more of a craft that demands medical instinct, Rainer provided us with the one effective measure to sustain it: uninterrupted self-examination".&lt;ref&gt;Brătescu, p.95&lt;/ref&gt; Vitner also noted Rainer's preference for orality, attributing it to an "extraordinary fear of the written word".&lt;ref&gt;Vitner, pp.100–101&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, other specialists rejected Rainer's ideas and approach. According to anatomist [[Victor Papilian]] (whom Rainer had denounced as a plagiarist), Rainer's was "a sterile and envious school" of self-proclaimed "geniuses". According to Papilian, Rainer moved freely between subjects outside of his competence, including the paleontology of [[Leonardo da Vinci]] and the latest discoveries in astronomy.&lt;ref name="rconst39"&gt;{{ro icon}} Richard Constantinescu, [https://web.archive.org/web/20140714184531/http://rmr.medica.ro/reviste_med/download/rmr/2011.1/RMR_Nr-1_2011_Art-8.pdf "Grigore T. Popa și Victor Papilian între 'juriu de onoare' și polemică"], in ''Revista Medicală Română'', n.1/2011, p.39&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite his progressive withdrawal from public life, Rainer was slowly being discovered as a public intellectual. In addition to his work at the university, he was again involved with ''Viața Românească'', and, from 1920, was one of the magazine's trustees.&lt;ref name="Riga &amp; Călin, p.63"&gt;Riga &amp; Călin, p.63&lt;/ref&gt; He taught [[kinesiology]] at the [[National Academy of Physical Education and Sport|Physical Education Institute]], and artistic anatomy at the [[Bucharest National University of Arts|School of Fine Arts]].&lt;ref&gt;Majuru, pp.282–283, 284–285; Riga &amp; Călin, p.75, 186–191&lt;/ref&gt; His lectures in anthropology, hosted by the Physical Education Institute from 1923, are believed to be the oldest form of anthropological education in Romania.&lt;ref&gt;Majuru, pp.282–283, 286&lt;/ref&gt; Also that year, Rainer made a noted contribution to [[biological anthropology]], publishing his finds on the medieval princely remains dug up in [[Curtea de Argeș]].&lt;ref&gt;Riga &amp; Călin, pp.84, 150&lt;/ref&gt; He pursued other such investigations into the Romanian past, including the [[craniometry]] of [[Michael the Brave]] and the description of ancient tombs dug up at [[Drobeta-Turnu Severin|Turnu Severin]].&lt;ref&gt;Riga &amp; Călin, p.94, 150–151&lt;/ref&gt;

Pursuing her own career in Bucharest hospitals, Marta was later a personal physician of [[Helen of Greece and Denmark|Helen of Greece]], wife of [[King of Romania|King]] [[Carol II of Romania]].&lt;ref&gt;Brătescu, p.125&lt;/ref&gt; In their personal life, the Rainers experienced disappointment: having received her education in Romania, Sofia Rainer left for England, to attend the [[University of Bristol]]; she grew estranged from the family after her marriage to an Englishman, Archibald Philip Laing Gordon.&lt;ref name="anmarta3"/&gt;

===Biological anthropology===
[[File:Rainer, 1928. Măsuratoare la Fundu Moldovei.jpg|thumb|240px|Rainer performing [[anthropometry]] at [[Fundu Moldovei]] (1928)]]
Rainer's views eventually placed him at odds with the emerging far-right and [[Antisemitism|antisemitic]] movement of the 1920s. At a time when the Iași-based [[National-Christian Defense League]] (LANC), seeking to purge [[History of the Jews in Romania|Jews]] from Romanian universities, was gaining momentum in Bucharest, a student identified Rainer as a Jew, and issued claims denying merit to his scholarship.&lt;ref name="rconst39"/&gt; According to Vitner, Rainer was the diametrical opposite of a Iași rival, the racist and LANC affiliate [[Nicolae Paulescu]], who stood for "dark and backward [[scientism]]".&lt;ref&gt;Vitner, p.101&lt;/ref&gt; Vitner also recalls that Rainer was even shot at by far-right affiliates, so that he would no longer popularize his "democratic convictions".&lt;ref&gt;Vitner, pp.107–108&lt;/ref&gt; For a while, Rainer was under the permanent protection of a [[Gendarmerie (Romania)|Gendarme]] guard.&lt;ref name="rconst39"/&gt;

Nevertheless, Rainer was himself an active proponent of "[[Genetic determinism|hereditary determinism]]" and [[eugenics]], which he understood as the cornerstone of social welfare policy.&lt;ref&gt;Bucur, pp.78–79, 110, 293–294. See also Majuru, p.285&lt;/ref&gt; As he put it: "In the colorful mass of genes that carry those characteristics we inherit from our forerunners, one may find embedded [...] even our very destinies as men."&lt;ref name="amaj282"/&gt; A committed [[Physiognomy|physiognomist]],&lt;ref&gt;Brătescu, pp.102–103&lt;/ref&gt; he believed that "only the [[phenotype]] may be influenced, to a certain extent, by our environment and our education."&lt;ref name="amaj282"/&gt; In June 1929, the newspaper ''[[Adevărul]]'' published one of Rainer's critical essays on the [[Land reform in Romania|1923 land reform]]. In it, Rainer claimed that the system of land reallocation had proved ignorant of eugenic and [[Biopolitics|biopolitical]] principles.&lt;ref&gt;Bucur, pp.78–79, 143, 327, 356&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, as readers of his work suggests, Rainer helped preserve a balance in anthropology by also looking into [[Environmental determinism|environmental factors]], thus questioning the ideological supremacy of [[scientific racism]].&lt;ref&gt;Vitner, p.105; Riga &amp; Călin, pp.147–149&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1920s and early '30s, Rainer was often depressed, believing that his contribution to medical science was largely insignificant.&lt;ref&gt;Riga &amp; Călin, pp.76, 77, 79–80&lt;/ref&gt; He was also upset that various of his disciples, including [[Daniel Danielopolu]], no longer acknowledged him in their own tracts about the "science of life", which seemed to him a case of [[plagiarism]].&lt;ref&gt;Riga &amp; Călin, pp.113–117&lt;/ref&gt; He was dividing his time between Bucharest and the resort of [[Cheia]], where he owned a small piece of property.&lt;ref&gt;Riga &amp; Călin, pp.190–191&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently, Rainer mainly focused on anthropological work and the popularization of anthropological science. Alongside sociologists such as [[Dimitrie Gusti]], [[Henri H. Stahl]], [[Sabin Manuilă]], [[Mircea Vulcănescu]] and [[Xenia Costa-Foru]], he was present on the teaching staff of Veturia Manuilă's private school, where he gave lectures in anatomy to all-female classes preparing for a career in social services.&lt;ref&gt;Bucur, pp.15, 238–240; Stahl, p.190&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1928 and 1932, Rainer was also involved in Gusti's [[rural sociology]] project in the [[Carpathians]]. Joining the Gusti team as an [[Anthropometry|anthropometrist]], he earned kudos from the scientific community of his day with ''Enquêtes anthropologiques dans trois villages roumains des Carpathes'' ("Anthropological Queries in Three Romanian Villages of the Carpathians").&lt;ref&gt;Bucur, p.78; Majuru, p.287; Riga &amp; Călin, pp.87–89, 152&lt;/ref&gt; Published in 1937, it remains one of just four testimonials written by members of Gusti's team.&lt;ref&gt;Țone, pp.64, 65&lt;/ref&gt;

While on location in [[Nereju]], [[Drăguș]] and [[Fundu Moldovei]], he expanded the canon of anthropometry, and began recording [[blood type]], investigated the presence and spread of [[syphilis]], and provided free medical consultations to the peasants.&lt;ref&gt;Majuru, pp.286–287; Stahl, pp.48, 68–69, 88–90, 106, 148, 175; Țone, ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt; Rainer and his specialist unit, including [[Social hygiene movement|social hygienists]], documented the squalid conditions of rural life. At Fundu Moldovei, where some of the villages were entirely cut off from the outside world, Rainer found that up to 50% of his samples showed contamination with syphilis, forcing him to distribute reserves of [[neosalvarsan]].&lt;ref&gt;Țone, pp.66, 71–72&lt;/ref&gt; Stahl, who befriended Rainer in Fundu Moldovei, recalls that the stated purpose of Rainer's visit was an attempt to bridge physiology and sociology: "he did not yet see what that connection might be, but any research should be carried out rigorously, so that, who knows, another generation, more skilled than we are, might come along and use it."&lt;ref&gt;Stahl, p.89&lt;/ref&gt;

Rainer's anthropometric work, which used for a permanent record peasant photographs, in large part taken by Milcu,&lt;ref&gt;Bălăceanu-Stolnici, pp.18, 19&lt;/ref&gt; remains a problematic aspect of Gustian sociology. As noted by cultural historian [[Z. Ornea]] (based on Stahl's recollections), Rainer "carried out unperturbed his anthropometric research, although he was not an adept of racial science and had no idea of what this anthropometry and blood chemistry [...] were going to be used for. And yet, the great professor of histology would return annually to the villages that were studied by the monographic teams and to carry out this research with no purpose and no finality."&lt;ref name="zointerviu"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Z. Ornea]], [http://www.romlit.ro/un_interviu_incitant_cu_h.h._stahl "Un interviu incitant cu H.H. Stahl"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', n.23/2001&lt;/ref&gt; Anthropologist [[Vintilă Mihăilescu]] also notes that the combination of Gusti's sociology and Rainer's physical anthropology was a "domestic [[ethnology]]", "self-referential" and "biased", but nevertheless an "important tool" for later cultural anthropology.&lt;ref&gt;Mihăilescu, pp.210–211&lt;/ref&gt;

Rainer also made frequent trips to Western Europe and the [[Balkans]]. He was in [[Sweden]] during 1930, attending the Physiological Congress as a Physical Education Institute delegate, and paying a visit to the [[Statens institut för rasbiologi|Racial Biology Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;Riga &amp; Călin, pp.75–76, 189–190&lt;/ref&gt; In 1931 and again in 1933, he was in [[Second Hellenic Republic|Greece]] together with sculptor [[Mac Constantinescu]], gathering material about artistic depictions of humans in the [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean period]].&lt;ref&gt;Hînganu, p.159; Riga &amp; Călin, p.76&lt;/ref&gt; In 1935, he lectured at the [[Romanian Atheneum]] on the links between [[Platonism]] and modern science, being introduced there by zoologist [[Constantin Kirițescu]] (one of several popularization conferences Rainer held at the Atheneum, Dalles Hall, and in various provincial cities).&lt;ref&gt;Riga &amp; Călin, p.15, 16, 90–94&lt;/ref&gt; He kept his depression under control by taking trips to Turkey, and again to Greece, where he dedicated himself to the study of customs and classical art.&lt;ref&gt;Riga &amp; Călin, pp.76–78&lt;/ref&gt; Upon his return, Rainer opened his bone collection for the public, as a permanent museum, during the Bucharest International Congress of Anthropology and Prehistorical Archeology, 1937. It comprised some 6,000 bone relics and casts.&lt;ref&gt;Majuru, p.287. See also Riga &amp; Călin, pp.84–86&lt;/ref&gt;

===Final years===
[[File:Regina-mamă Elena și Regele Mihai I vizitează Institutul de antropologie în toamna anului 1940.jpg|thumb|300px|Rainer at his anthropological research center, alongside [[King of Romania|King]] [[Michael I of Romania|Michael I]] and [[Helen of Greece and Denmark|Queen Helen]] (autumn 1940)]]
With his activity in academia, Rainer reacted against [[cronyism]], taking a public stand against arbitrary appointments in teaching, and ruining his relationship with the establishment.&lt;ref&gt;Riga &amp; Călin, p.79-80&lt;/ref&gt; At a time when the Romanian school of anthropology was being divided between centrists and supporters of the [[Fascism|fascist]] [[Iron Guard]],&lt;ref name="zointerviu"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stahl, pp.23, 143–144, 157, 185, 214–221, 299–300, 313–315, 332–333&lt;/ref&gt; he was again confronted by the far-right. Rainer was opposed to the fascist youth, whose members instigated in favor of academic censorship in his university curriculum. At one such incident in early 1938, Rainer stood unmoved at his desk as some of his fascist students, including the son of painter [[Nicolae Tonitza]],&lt;ref name="mnbnegru"/&gt; lit firecrackers and threw eggs in his direction. However, he refused to ask for sanctions against them, and eventually received their letter of apology.&lt;ref&gt;Riga &amp; Călin, pp.80–81&lt;/ref&gt;

After 1939, although Romania was formally aligned with [[Nazi Germany]], Rainer spoke out against [[Nazism and race|Nazi racial science]]. In his public lectures, he dismissed the Nazi claim that [[cephalic index]]es were good predictors of intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;Bălăceanu-Stolnici, p.16&lt;/ref&gt; His publicized texts, deemed "courageous" by historian Adrian Majuru, accepted the idea of race, but denied the concept of a "pure race", rejected the scientific claims of [[Aryan race|Aryanism]], and argued that European civilization owed its existence to [[Semitic peoples]].&lt;ref&gt;Majuru, p.286. See also Riga &amp; Călin, pp.89, 145–148&lt;/ref&gt; According to Rainer, races were rather phenotypical isolates of only one species, the ''[[Anatomically modern humans|homo sapiens recens]]'', of the same genetic age; there existed no racial hierarchy.&lt;ref&gt;Riga &amp; Călin, pp.145–147&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1940, at the height of [[World War II]], Rainer helped establish an anthropological research center of which he was honorary director until his death.&lt;ref name="institutul"&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://www.antropologia.ro/Istoric Istoric] at the Institutul de Antropologie Francisc I. Rainer al Academiei Române site&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hînganu, p.159; Majuru, p.286; Mihăilescu, pp.210–211; Riga &amp; Călin, pp.84–87, 140&lt;/ref&gt; That year, he and his institution were admitted into the French Prehistoric Society.&lt;ref&gt;"Conseil d'Administration pour les années 1940 et 1941", in ''Bulletin de la Société Préhistorique de France'', 38, n.1–2/1941, p.4&lt;/ref&gt; In 1941, following Romania's entry, alongside Germany, in the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|war against the Soviet Union]], Rainer obtained that his team of doctors be spared conscription.&lt;ref name="mnbnegru"/&gt;

Later that year, Rainer retired from teaching, having reached the age limit. The students demanded and obtained that he be allowed to hold additional lectures in general and human biology, despite Rainer's problematic deafness.&lt;ref name="mnbnegru"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brătescu, pp.101–103, 106, 113–116; Riga &amp; Călin, p.91&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, G. T. Popa, who had continued Rainer's anatomical work in Iași between 1928 and 1942, took over his chair in Bucharest.&lt;ref&gt;Hînganu, pp.160–161&lt;/ref&gt; Tensions between Popa and his mentor were already showing in public,&lt;ref&gt;Bălăceanu-Stolnici, p.18; Brătescu, p.105&lt;/ref&gt; with Popa fending off accusations that he had taken credit for Rainer's work on the [[hypophyseal portal system]].&lt;ref&gt;Popa, ''passim''; Riga &amp; Călin, p.138&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1943, Rainer was made an honorary member of the [[Romanian Academy]].&lt;ref name="r&amp;c99"&gt;Riga &amp; Călin, p.99&lt;/ref&gt; He continued to publish anthropological contributions, including a 1942 description (with [[Ion Th. Simionescu]] as the co-author) of the [[Peștera Muierilor|Cioclovina Skull]], the first such [[paleolithic]] discovery on Romanian soil.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dumitru Berciu]], "Dări de seamă. Fr. Rainer și I. Simionescu, ''Sur le premier crâne d'homme paléolithique trouvé en Roumanie''", in ''Revista Istorică'', n.7–12/1943, pp.297–298; Riga &amp; Călin, pp.144, 150&lt;/ref&gt; He also contributed a chapter on "the living substance" to [[Victor Vâlcovici]]'s 1943 synthesis, ''Materia și viața'' ("Matter and Life").&lt;ref&gt;N. Bărbulescu, "Cronici. ''Materia și viața''", in ''[[Gândirea]]'', n.4–5/1944, p.239; Riga &amp; Călin, p.195&lt;/ref&gt; He was still an outspoken adversary of the Nazi regime. Maintaining a philosophical correspondence with the medievalist [[Alphonse Dupront]], who was stranded in [[German military administration in occupied France during World War II|occupied France]], he described the Nazi age as an "empire of suffering", reaffirming his conviction in "the future of mankind".&lt;ref&gt;Riga &amp; Călin, p.96&lt;/ref&gt; He was among the signers of a letter of protest, addressed to dictator [[Ion Antonescu]], which questioned Romania's participation in the anti-Soviet war.&lt;ref&gt;Riga &amp; Călin, p.18&lt;/ref&gt;

During the same months, Rainer diagnosed himself with [[lung cancer]], which was another probable effect of his long exposure to formaldehyde fumes.&lt;ref name="r&amp;c99"/&gt; He tried to hide this from his wife and his friends, claiming his problem was a mere case of [[Vocal cord paresis|paresis]].&lt;ref&gt;Riga &amp; Călin, pp.99–100&lt;/ref&gt; His house was narrowly missed by the [[Bombing of Bucharest in World War II|April 1944 bombardment]], and he had to move into the house of a former assistant, [[Ion Țurai]]. He was later moved to Hospital No. 303, where he developed [[metastasis]] in the brain.&lt;ref&gt;Riga &amp; Călin, p.100&lt;/ref&gt;

Rainer asked to be relocated to his townhouse, where he died on the morning of August 4, 1944. He had predicted the exact time of his death, and written precise instructions for his body's [[embalming]].&lt;ref&gt;Riga &amp; Călin, pp.100, 101&lt;/ref&gt; This occurred just nineteen days before the [[King Michael's Coup|Palace Coup]] that ended Romania's alliance with the [[Axis Powers]]. With the onset of [[Soviet occupation of Romania|Soviet occupation]], Rainer's left-wing stances were highlighted in his official commemoration. Brătescu, who was also a [[Union of Communist Youth|Communist Youth]] militant, published such homages in the newspaper ''Tribuna Poporului'', and spoke about Rainer at the Students' Society.&lt;ref&gt;Brătescu, pp.122–124, 134&lt;/ref&gt; In the latter address, he emphasized that Rainer had been an [[Antifascism|antifascist]] and a reader of political works by [[Joseph Stalin]].&lt;ref&gt;Brătescu, p.134&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Rainer was generally well regarded by the [[Communist Romania|communist regime]], which existed in Romania until the [[Romanian Revolution of 1989|1989 Revolution]]. His texts on science and society were collected and preserved, against Rainer's final wish that they should all be burned.&lt;ref name="Riga &amp; Călin, p.63"/&gt;  Some were carried in the first issues of ''[[Contemporanul]]'' review, from September 1946.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ioan Lăcustă]], "În București, acum 50 de ani", in ''[[Magazin Istoric]]'', September 1996, p.31&lt;/ref&gt; In 1948, the corpus was published by the Academy as four volumes, together with critical essays and memoirs edited by Marta Rainer and [[Mihail Sevastos]].&lt;ref&gt;Vitner, p.100. See also Riga &amp; Călin, pp.5–6, 14–15&lt;/ref&gt; However, his anthropological museum, assigned to Popa and later to Milcu, was poorly staffed by the communist supervisors and faced closure. Communist supervisors such as [[Mihail Roller]] suspected that Rainer had created the anthropology research center to promote racism, but Milcu was able to convince them otherwise, and even obtained funds for an anthropological study of [[Origin of the Romanians|Romanian ethnogenesis]].&lt;ref&gt;Bălăceanu-Stolnici, pp.15–16&lt;/ref&gt; Despite other political obstacles and the communist rejection of anthropology as an "abstract intellectual game", cultural anthropologist Vasile Caramelea was able to obtain approval for further research, and expanded the institute's contribution to social science.&lt;ref&gt;Mihăilescu, p.212&lt;/ref&gt;

A biography of Rainer was published by Ilie Th. Riga, in 1966, at [[Editura Științifică]]. It revealed to the public glimpses of Rainer's diaries, which had been preserved by Marta Rainer.&lt;ref&gt;Riga &amp; Călin, pp.5–6&lt;/ref&gt; Another encomium, signed by Th. Enăchescu, saw print in the academic journal ''Studii și Cercetări Antopologice'' in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;Brătescu, p.318&lt;/ref&gt; In 1979, at [[Editura Eminescu]], Brătescu and Mihai Neagu Basarab published Rainer's diaries and letters, which were received with great interest by the intellectual community, including [[Geo Bogza]], [[Constantin Noica]] and [[Nicolae Steinhardt]],&lt;ref&gt;Brătescu, pp.343, 365&lt;/ref&gt; but less enthusiastically by the general public. As later noted by Brătescu, regular readers found Rainer's thoughts on "the coherence of the Cosmos" to be "pretentious banalities".&lt;ref&gt;Brătescu, p.344&lt;/ref&gt;

Rainer continued to be held in high regard after the Revolution, when light was shed on various other aspects of his work. A 2001 exhibit of his skulls collection at Galeria Catacomba made a point of reintroducing his work to the cultural circles of the day.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Pavel Șușară]], [http://www.romlit.ro/un_patrimoniu_de_scfrlii "Un patrimoniu de scăfîrlii"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', n.9/2001&lt;/ref&gt; The anthropological center that Rainer helped established was renamed in his honor in 2007.&lt;ref name="institutul"/&gt;

{{Nihongo|'''''Honmei choco'''''|本命チョコ||"true feeling chocolate"}} in Japan is chocolate given by women on [[Valentine's Day]] to men whom the giver has romantic feelings for. This is often given to husbands, [[boyfriend]]s, and prospective boyfriends. ''Honmei'' chocolate is usually higher-quality and more expensive than ''[[giri choco]]'' ("obligation chocolate"), which is given to male coworkers and other men the woman has no romantic attachment to.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=123635365|title=Japanese Embrace Valentine's Day|publisher=[[National Public Radio]]|accessdate=February 14, 2010|date=February 12, 2010|last=Craft|first=Lucy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Homemade ''honmei choco'' is also popular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content.time.com/time/business/article/0,8599,1589631,00.html|title=How Valentine's Day Conquered Japan|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|accessdate=April 23, 2016|date=February 14, 2007|last=Sekiguchi|first=Toko}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is generally reciprocated on [[White Day]], celebrated on March 14, when men buy candy and gifts for women.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8590">[[File:Versailles Palace.jpg|thumb|300px|The Palace of Versailles where the formal presentations for ladies took place]]

The '''Honneurs de la Cour''' ('''Honors of the Court''') were ceremonious presentations to the sovereign at the [[Palace of Versailles|Royal Court of France]] that were formal for women but more casual for men. It was an honour granted only to the families of [[Noblesse d'épée|ancient nobility]]. It allowed them to approach the [[King of France|King]] and the [[Queen of France|Queen]] of France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.isgn.fr/autres/img358a.pdf |title=Notice historique sur les honneurs de la Cour |language=French |publisher=Institution Saint Georges pour la Noblesse |quote=...''(etre admis aux) honneurs de la Cour, c'est-a-dire aux cercles, aux receptions, aux bals du Roi et de la Reine, pour monter dans les carrosses de Sa majeste et l'accompagner a la chasse''; in English: ''[the Honors of the Court meant] to be allow to attend the circles, receptions and balls of the King and the Queen, to get into His Majesty's carriages and to go hunting with the King''. |year=2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721001229/http://www.isgn.fr/autres/img358a.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The Honors of the Court "were the most prestigious noble honour of the 18th century, meant to honour the most ancient and representing noble families".&lt;ref name="Valette"&gt;Régis Valette, ''Catalogue de la noblesse française au XXIe siècle'', éd. Robert Laffont, Paris, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Formally such presentations were only granted to noble families able to prove a lineage dating back to 1400 A.D. without tracks of ennoblement. However, the king could grant exemptions to families that had been dedicated to serve him. He could also refuse a valid candidate with sufficient nobility whose family was not involved enough in the king's wars as nobles were primarily mounted warriors who had sworn allegiance to their sovereign and promised to fight for him. On a list of candidates he would then place a remark next to the name of the refused applicant saying "ne se peut" (can't be) or "attendre" (wait).

The Honors of the Court should not be mistaken for court life. The oldest nobility did not always match the court nobility. Many families living at court were descendants from [[Noblesse de robe|less ancient nobility]] while many nobles of [[Noblesse d'épée|antique nobility]] did not stay at court. Moreover, life at the Versailles Court was expensive and many were unable to afford it.

The nobleman who was granted the presentation would follow a royal hunt on board of one of the king's carriages. At that point he would be casually introduced to the king. A noblewoman's presentation was much more formal, taking place during a specific ceremony.

From 1715 to 1790,&lt;ref&gt;The ''Honneurs'' were codified in 1715 (the first year of [[Louis XV]]'s reign), there were no more presentation after the [[French Revolution|fall of the monarchy]] in 1790.&lt;/ref&gt; 942 families were granted the Honors of the Court; 880 of them were French. François Bluche, who studied the royal genealogical archives, said that among the 942 families "462 were able to prove a noble lineage dating back to 1400, if excluding sovereign houses and foreign nobles who, unlike one can think, made up more than half of the French nobleman received at Court".&lt;ref name="Bluche"&gt;{{cite magazine|first=François |last=Bluche |title=Les Honneurs de la Cour |location=Paris | series=Les Cahiers nobles |date=1957 |magazine=[[L'intermédiaire des Chercheurs et des Curieux]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has limited his work to a list of 43 [[Noble family|Houses]] especially flattered by the King's archive, these 43 families are considered of major regional or national importance and members of the highest 18th century nobility. 

According to Régis Valette&lt;ref name="Valette"/&gt; only 280 of the 880 French families who were granted the Honors of the Court still remain today.

== Data ==
In recent years, there has been a surge in large data sets available on human movements. These data sets are usually obtained from [[cell phone tracking|cell phone]] or [[GPS tracking|GPS]] data, with varying degrees of accuracy. For example, cell phone data is usually recorded whenever a call or a text message has been made or received by the user, and contains the location of the tower that the phone has connected to as well as the time stamp.&lt;ref name=marta /&gt; In urban areas, user and the telecommunication tower might be only a few hundred meters away from each other, while in rural areas this distance might well be in region of a few kilometers. Therefore, there is varying degree of accuracy when it comes to locating a person using cell phone data. These datasets are anonymized by the phone companies so as to hide and protect the identity of actual users. As example of its usage, researchers &lt;ref name=marta /&gt; used the trajectory of 100,000 cell phone users within a period of six months, while in much larger scale &lt;ref name=song /&gt; trajectories of three million cell phone users were analyzed.
GPS data are usually much more accurate even though they usually are, because of [[privacy]] concerns, much harder to acquire. Massive amounts of GPS data describing human mobility are produced, for example, by on-board GPS devices on private vehicles.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2015/150908/ncomms9166/full/ncomms9166.html|title = Returners and Explorers dichotomy in Human Mobility|last = Luca Pappalardo|date = 8 September 2015|journal = Nature Communications|doi = 10.1038/ncomms9166|pmid = 26349016|volume = 6|display-authors=etal|pages=8166|pmc=4569739|bibcode=2015NatCo...6E8166P}}&lt;/ref&gt; The GPS device automatically turns on when the vehicle starts, and the sequence of GPS points the device produces every few seconds forms a detailed mobility trajectory of the vehicle. Some recent scientific studies compared the mobility patterns emerged from mobile phone data with those emerged from GPS data.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;L. Pappalardo et al., [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=6855925&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fxpls%2Fabs_all.jsp%3Farnumber%3D6855925 Comparing general mobility and mobility by car], BRICS Countries Congress (BRICS-CCI) and 11th Brazilian Congress (CBIC) on Computational Intelligence, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers have been able to extract very detailed information about the people whose data are made available to public. This has sparked a great amount of concern about privacy issues. As an example of liabilities that might happen, [[New York City]] released 173 million individual [[taxi]] trips. City officials used a very weak [[cryptography algorithm]] to anonymize the license number and medallion number, which is an alphanumeric code assigned to each taxi cab.&lt;ref name=gawker&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gawker.com/the-public-nyc-taxicab-database-that-accidentally-track-1646724546 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-11-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141118175119/http://gawker.com/the-public-nyc-taxicab-database-that-accidentally-track-1646724546 |archivedate=2014-11-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This made it possible for hackers to completely de-anonymize the dataset, and even some were able to extract detailed information about specific passengers and celebrities, including their origin and destination and how much they tipped.&lt;ref name=gawker /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jun/27/new-york-taxi-details-anonymised-data-researchers-warn&lt;/ref&gt;

== Characteristics ==
At the large scale, when the behaviour is modelled over a period of relatively long duration (e.g. more than one day), human mobility can be described by three major components:
* trip distance distribution &lt;math&gt; P(r) &lt;/math&gt;
* radius of [[gyration]]  &lt;math&gt; r_g (t)&lt;/math&gt;
* number of visited locations &lt;math&gt; S(t) &lt;/math&gt;

Brockmann,&lt;ref&gt;The scaling laws of human travel. D Brockmann, L Hufnagel, T Geisel - Nature, 2006 - nature.com&lt;/ref&gt; by analysing banknotes, found that the probability of travel distance follows a [[scale-free network|scale-free]] [[random walk]] known as [[Lévy flight]] of form &lt;math&gt; P(r)\ \sim r^{-(1+\beta)} &lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\beta =0.6 &lt;/math&gt;. This was later confirmed by two studies that used cell phone data&lt;ref name=marta /&gt; and GPS data to track users.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1140%2Fepjst%2Fe2013-01715-5|title = Understanding the patterns of car travel|last = Luca Pappalardo|date = 29 January 2013|journal = European Physical Journal ST|doi = 10.1140/epjst/e2013-01715-5|pmid = |access-date = |volume = 215|issue = 1|display-authors=etal|pages=61–73|bibcode = 2013EPJST.215...61P}}&lt;/ref&gt; The implication of this model is that, as opposed to other more traditional forms of random walks such as [[brownian motion]], human trips tend to be of mostly short distances with a few long distance ones. In brownian motion, the distribution of trip distances are govern by a bell-shaped curve, which means that the next trip is of a roughly predictable size, the average, where in Lévy flight it might be an order of magnitude larger than the average.

Some people are inherently inclined to travel longer distances than the average, and the same is true for people with lesser urge for movement. Radius of gyration is used to capture just that and it indicates the characteristic distance travelled by a person during a time period t.&lt;ref name=marta&gt;Understanding individual human mobility patterns
MC Gonzalez, CA Hidalgo, AL Barabasi - Nature, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Each user, within his radius of gyration &lt;math&gt; r_g (t)&lt;/math&gt;, will choose his trip distance according to &lt;math&gt; P(r) &lt;/math&gt;.

The third component models the fact that humans tend to visit some locations more often than what would have happened under a random scenario. For example, home or workplace or favorite restaurants are visited much more than many other places in a user's radius of gyration. It has been discovered that &lt;math&gt; S(t)\ \sim t^{\mu} &lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt; \mu = 0.6 &lt;/math&gt;, which indicates a sublinear growth in different number of places visited by an individual .
These three measures capture the fact that most trips happen between a limited number of places, with less frequent travels to places outside of an individual's radius of gyration.

== Predictability ==
Although the human mobility is modeled as a random process, it is surprisingly predictable. By measuring the entropy of each person's movement, it has been shown &lt;ref name=song&gt;Limits of predictability in human mobility. C Song, Z Qu, N Blumm, AL Barabási - Science, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; that there is a 93% potential predictability. This means that although there is a great variance in type of users and the distances that each of them travel, the overall characteristic of them is highly predictable. Implication of it is that in principle, it is possible to accurately model the processes that are dependent on human mobility patterns, such as disease or mobile virus spreading patterns.&lt;ref name=airtransportation&gt;A metric of influential spreading during contagion dynamics through the air transportation network

On individual scale, daily human mobility can be explained by only 17 [[Network motif]]s. Each individual, shows one of these motifs characteristically, over a period of several months. This opens up the possibility to reproduce daily individual mobility using a tractable analytical model&lt;ref&gt;Unravelling daily human mobility motifs
CM Schneider, V Belik, T Couronné, Z Smoreda… - Journal of The Royal Society Interface, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==
[[Infectious disease]]s spread across the globe usually because of long-distance travels of carriers of the disease. These long-distance travels are made using [[air transport]]ation systems and it has been shown that "[[network topology]], traffic structure, and individual mobility patterns are all essential for accurate predictions of disease spreading".&lt;ref name=airtransportation/&gt; On a smaller spatial scale the regularity of human movement patterns and its temporal structure should be taken into account in models of infectious disease spread.&lt;ref name=commuting&gt;V Belik, T Geisel, D Brockmann, Natural human mobility patterns and spatial spread of infectious diseases. Phys. Rev. X, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Cellphone viruses that are transmitted via bluetooth are greatly dependent on the human interaction and movements. With more people using similar operating systems for their cellphones, it's becoming much easier to have a virus epidemic.&lt;ref name=phonevirus /&gt;

In [[Transportation Planning]], leveraging the characteristics of human movement, such as tendency to travel short distances with few but regular bursts of long-distance trips, novel improvements have been made to [[Trip distribution]] models, specifically to [[Gravity model of migration]] &lt;ref&gt;A universal model for mobility and migration patterns

'''Integrity''' is the quality of being honest and having strong moral principles, or moral uprightness. It is a personal choice to hold one's self to consistent standards.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[ethics]], integrity is regarded as the honesty and [[Honesty|truthfulness]] or [[accuracy]] of one's actions. Integrity can stand in opposition to [[hypocrisy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Contemporary rhetorical theory: a reader|year=1999|publisher=Guilford Press|isbn=1-57230-401-4|page=92|author=John Louis Lucaites|author2=Celeste Michelle Condit |author3=Sally Caudill |editor=
}}&lt;/ref&gt; in that judging with the standards of integrity involves regarding internal consistency as a virtue, and suggests that parties holding within themselves apparently conflicting values should account for the discrepancy or alter their beliefs. The word ''integrity'' evolved from the Latin adjective ''[[wikt:integer#Latin|integer]]'', meaning ''whole'' or ''complete''.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; In this context, integrity is the inner sense of "wholeness" deriving from qualities such as [[honesty]] and consistency of [[Moral character|character]]. As such, one may judge that others "have integrity" to the extent that they act according to the values, beliefs and principles they claim to hold.

Significant attention is given to the subject of integrity in law and the conception of law in 20th century philosophy of law and jurisprudence centering in part on the research of [[Ronald Dworkin]] as studied in his book ''[[Law's Empire]]''. Dworkin's position on integrity in law reinforces the conception of justice viewed as fairness.

== In ethics ==
In [[ethics]] when discussing [[behavior]] and [[morality]], an individual is said to possess the virtue of integrity if the individual's actions are based upon an internally consistent framework of principles.&lt;ref name="MacCallum1993"&gt;{{cite book|author=Gerald Cushing MacCallum|title=Legislative Intent and Other Essays on Law, Politics, and Morality|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y3yLFD_FgdIC|accessdate=12 July 2014|year=1993|publisher=Univ of Wisconsin Press|isbn=978-0-299-13860-8|page=152}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pillai2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Krishna Pillai|title=Essence of a Manager|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iUU64EsXeHEC|accessdate=12 July 2014|date=26 February 2011|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-3-642-17581-7|page=163}}&lt;/ref&gt; These principles should uniformly adhere to sound logical [[axiom]]s or postulates. One can describe a person as having ethical integrity to the extent that the individual's actions, beliefs, methods, measures and principles all derive from a single [[value system|core group of values]]. An individual must therefore be flexible and willing to adjust these values to maintain consistency when these values are challenged—such as when an expected test result is not congruent with all observed outcomes. Because such flexibility is a form of [[accountability]], it is regarded as a [[moral responsibility]] as well as a [[virtue]].

An individual's [[value system]] provides a [[Conceptual framework|framework]] within which the individual acts in ways which are consistent and expected. Integrity can be seen as the state or condition of having such a framework, and acting congruently within the given framework.

One essential aspect of a consistent framework is its avoidance of any unwarranted (arbitrary) exceptions for a particular person or group—especially the person or group that holds the framework.  In law, this principle of universal application requires that even those in positions of official power be subject to the same laws as pertain to their fellow citizens.  In personal ethics, this principle requires that one should not act according to any rule that one would not wish to see universally followed.  For example, one should not steal unless one would want to live in a world in which everyone was a thief.  The philosopher [[Immanuel Kant]] formally described the principle of universal application in his [[categorical imperative]].

The concept of integrity implies a wholeness, a comprehensive corpus of beliefs, often referred to as a [[worldview]]. This concept of wholeness emphasizes [[honesty]] and [[Authenticity (philosophy)|authenticity]], requiring that one act at all times in accordance with the individual's chosen worldview.

Ethical integrity is not synonymous with the good, as Zuckert and Zuckert show about [[Ted Bundy]]:

{{quote|When caught, he defended his actions in terms of the fact-value distinction. He scoffed at those, like the professors from whom he learned the fact-value distinction, who still lived their lives as if there were truth-value to value claims. He thought they were fools and that he was one of the few who had the courage and integrity to live a consistent life in light of the truth that value judgments, including the command "Thou shalt not kill," are merely subjective assertions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zuckert|first1=Catherine H.|authorlink1=Catherine H.

== Political integrity ==

Integrity is important for politicians because they are chosen, appointed, or elected to serve society. To be able to serve, politicians are given power to make, execute, or control policy. They have the power to influence something or someone. There is, however, a risk that politicians will not use this power to serve society.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} Aristotle said that because rulers have power they will be tempted to use it for personal gain.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle (2000), ''Politics'', translated by B. Jowett, New York: Dover.&lt;/ref&gt; It is important that politicians withstand this temptation, and that requires integrity.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

In the book ''The Servant of the People'', Muel Kaptein describes that integrity starts with that politicians should know what their position entails, because integrity is related to their position. Integrity also demands knowledge and compliance with both the letter and the spirit of the written and unwritten rules. Integrity is also acting consistently not only with what is generally accepted as moral, what others think, but primarily with what is ethical, what politicians should do based on reasonable arguments.&lt;ref name="Kaptein 2014"&gt;{{cite journal
| ssrn = 2498730

| author =

| first = Muel
| year = 2014
| publisher = Social Science Research Network
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, integrity is not just about why a politician acts in a certain way, but also about who the politician is. Questions about a person’s integrity cast doubt not only on their intentions but also on the source of those intentions, the person’s character. So integrity is about having the right ethical virtues that become visible in a pattern of behavior.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

Important virtues of politicians are faithfulness, humility.&lt;ref name="Kaptein 2014"/&gt; and accountability. Furthermore, they should be authentic and a role model. [[Aristotle]] identified pride (''megalopsuchia'', variously translated as proper pride, greatness of soul and magnanimity)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=iBoqmEvavawC&amp;pg=PA93&amp;lpg=PA93&amp;dq=megalopsuchia+magnanimity+and+pride |title=The Nicomachean Ethics By Aristotle, James Alexander, Kerr Thomson, Hugh Tredennick, Jonathan Barnes translators |publisher=Books.google.com |accessdate=2012-03-11|isbn=9780140449495 |year=1976 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as the crown of the virtues, distinguishing it from vanity, temperance, and humility.

==In the philosophy of law==
Dworkin argues that moral principles that people hold dear are often wrong, even to the extent that certain crimes are acceptable if one's principles are skewed enough. To discover and apply these principles, courts interpret the legal data (legislation, cases etc.) with a view to articulating an interpretation that best explains and justifies past legal practice. All interpretation must follow, Dworkin argues, from the notion of "[[law as integrity]]" to make sense.

Out of the idea that law is 'interpretive' in this way, Dworkin argues that in every situation where people's legal rights are controversial, the best interpretation involves the right answer thesis, the thesis that there exists a right answer as a matter of law that the judge must discover. Dworkin opposes the notion that judges have a discretion in such difficult cases.

Dworkin's model of legal principles is also connected with Hart's notion of the [[Rule of Recognition]]. Dworkin rejects Hart's conception of a master rule in every legal system that identifies valid laws, on the basis that this would [[logical consequence|entail]] that the process of identifying law must be uncontroversial, whereas (Dworkin argues) people have legal rights even in cases where the correct legal outcome is open to reasonable dispute. Dworkin moves away from [[legal positivism|positivism's]] separation of law and morality, since constructive interpretation implicates moral judgments in every decision about what the law is.

== Psychological/work-selection tests ==

{{See also|Employment integrity testing}}

The procedures known as "integrity tests" or (more confrontationally) as "honesty tests"&lt;ref&gt;van Minden (2005:206-208): ''[...] deze 'integriteitstests' (dat klinkt prettiger dan eerlijkheids- of leugentests) [...]'' [Translation: ... these 'integrity tests' (that sounds nicer than honesty test or lies tests)]&lt;/ref&gt; aim to identify prospective employees who may hide perceived negative or derogatory aspects of their past, such as a criminal conviction, {{According to whom|[[psychiatric treatment]]|date=May 2018}} or drug abuse. Identifying unsuitable candidates can save the employer from problems that might otherwise arise during their term of employment. Integrity tests make certain assumptions, specifically:&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
* that persons who have "low integrity" report more dishonest behaviour
* that persons who have "low integrity" try to find reasons to justify such behaviour
* that persons who have "low integrity" think others more likely to commit crimes—like theft, for example. (Since people seldom sincerely declare to prospective employers their past deviance, the "integrity" testers adopted an indirect approach: letting the work-candidates talk about what they think of the deviance of other people, considered in general, as a written answer demanded by the questions of the "integrity test".)&lt;ref name=tipvanminden&gt;Van Minden (2005:207) writes “TIP: Dit type vragenlijsten melden koelbloedig dat zij kunnen ontdekken wanneer u een misleidend antwoord geeft of de zaak bedondert. U weet langzammerhand dat geen enkele test zo'n claim waar kan maken, zelfs niet een die gespecialiseerd is in het opsporen van bedriegers.” Translated: “TIP: This sort of questions lists mention in cool blood that they are able to detect when you give a cheating answer or try to deceive the test. You are step by step learning that no test could make true such a pretense, not even one specialized in detecting cheaters.”&lt;/ref&gt;
* that persons who have "low integrity" exhibit [[impulsivity|impulsive]] behaviour
* that persons who have "low integrity" tend to think that society should severely punish deviant behaviour (Specifically, "integrity tests" assume that people who have a history of deviance report within such tests that they support harsher measures applied to the deviance exhibited by other people.)

The claim that such tests can detect "fake" answers plays a crucial role in detecting people who have low integrity. Naive respondents really believe this pretense and behave accordingly, reporting some of their past deviance and their thoughts about the deviance of others, fearing that if they do not answer truthfully their untrue answers will reveal their "low integrity". These respondents believe that the more candid they are in their answers, the higher their "integrity score" will be.&lt;ref name=tipvanminden/&gt;

== Other integrities ==

Disciplines and fields with an interest in integrity include [[philosophy of action]], philosophy of [[medicine]], [[mathematics]], the [[mind]], [[cognition]], [[consciousness]], [[materials science]], [[structural engineering]], and [[politics]]. Popular psychology identifies personal integrity, professional integrity, artistic integrity, and intellectual integrity.

For example, a scientific investigation should not determine the outcome in advance of the actual results. As an example of a breach of this principle, Public Health England, a UK Government agency, recently stated that they upheld a line of government policy in advance of the outcome of a study that they had commissioned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Countess of Mar|title=Incinerators: Health Hazards (HL3533). Written question dated 23-11-2017 and answer from Lord O'Shaughnessy dated 05-12-2017|url=http://www.parliament.uk/business/publications/written-questions-answers-statements/written-questions-answers|website=House of Lords|accessdate=30 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of integrity may also feature in [[business]] contexts beyond the issues of employee/employer honesty and ethical behavior, notably in marketing or branding contexts. The "integrity" of a brand is regarded by some as a desirable outcome for companies seeking to maintain a consistent, unambiguous position in the mind of their audience. This integrity of brand includes consistent messaging and often includes using a set of graphics standards to maintain visual integrity in [[marketing communications]]. Kaptein and Wempe have developed a theory of corporate integrity including criteria for businesses dealing with moral dilemmas.&lt;ref&gt;Muel Kaptein and Johan Wempe, 2002 “The Balanced Company: A theory of corporate integrity” (Oxford University Press).&lt;/ref&gt;

Another use of the term, "integrity" appears in the work of [[Michael C. Jensen|Michael Jensen]] and [[Werner Erhard]] in their academic paper, "Integrity: A Positive Model that Incorporates the Normative Phenomenon of Morality, Ethics, and Legality". In this paper the authors explore a new model of integrity as the state of being whole and complete, unbroken, unimpaired, sound, and in perfect condition. They posit a new model of integrity that provides access to increased performance for individuals, groups, organizations, and societies. Their model "reveals the causal link between integrity and increased performance, quality of life, and value-creation for all entities, and provides access to that causal link."&lt;ref&gt;

According to Muel Kaptein, integrity is not a one-dimensional concept. In his book he presents a multifaceted perspective of integrity. Integrity relates to, for example, compliance to the rules as well as to social expectations, with morality as well as ethics, and with actions as well as attitude.&lt;ref name="Kaptein 2014"/&gt;

Electronic signals are said to have integrity when there is no corruption of information between one domain and another, such as from a disk drive to a computer display.   Such integrity is a fundamental principle of [[information assurance]].  Corrupted information is [[Trust (social sciences)|untrustworthy]], yet uncorrupted information is of value.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3450">'''Marit ayin''' ({{lang-he-n|מַרְאִית עַיִן}} 'appearance to the eye'; [[Ashkenazic Hebrew|Ashkenazic transliteration]]: '''maris ayin'''), is a concept in [[halakha]] (Jewish law) which states that certain actions which might {{em|seem}} to observers to be in violation of [[Jewish law]], but in reality are fully permissible, are themselves not allowed due to rabbinic enactments that were put in place to prevent onlookers from arriving at a false conclusion.&lt;ref&gt;Minchas Shlomo 2-3:53.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, according to the [[Torah]] law, the blood of an animal is forbidden to eat, but the blood of a fish is permissible. However, according to the principle of marit ayin, it is forbidden to eat the blood of fish as an onlooker may believe the blood being eaten is from an animal and is thus allowed to be eaten.&lt;ref&gt;Talmud Keritut Pg. 21&lt;/ref&gt;

== In private ==
There is a disagreement in the [[Talmud]] as to whether the concept of marit ayin applies in private. [[Beit Shamai]] believes that marit ayin applies even in private, whereas Beit Hillel believes that marit ayin does not apply in private.&lt;ref&gt;Talmud Beitzah Pg. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

== Doesn’t always apply ==
According to Rabbi [[Moshe Feinstein]] in his book ''Igrot Moshe'', marit ayin applies only when "Someone thinks that I violated something, or he thinks that I inappropriately ate something non-kosher. However, it does not include doing something permitted that people may mistakenly think is forbidden due to the fact that they do not know the [[halakhah|Jewish law]]."&lt;ref&gt;Igros Moshe O.C. 1:96.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, a permitted act which an onlooker might come to believe is a forbidden act being performed, is a case of marit ayin and thus not allowed. However, an act which is allowed which an onlooker might believe is forbidden is not case of marit ayin.

== Judge your fellow favorably ==
There is a principle in Judaism called "dan l'kaf zechus" or judge your fellow favorably.&lt;ref&gt;Talmud Shavuot Pg. 30&lt;/ref&gt; The principle of marit ayin seems to be in contradiction with this principle as if one is performing an action that may look forbidden, it shouldn’t be worried that an onlooker will think a forbidden action is being performed as we should judge him favorably that he will judge his fellow individual favorably that he is indeed not performing a wrongful act. However, the truth is that the rabbinic prohibition was not put into place because one may think his fellow man is committing a sin, but rather because he may mistakenly think that the action that he wrongly sees taking place is indeed permissible and thus commits the wrongful action himself in error.

== Changes over time ==
According to the [[Shulchan Aruch]], if something which was prohibited in the times of the Talmud because of marit ayin is no longer a concern due to modern day circumstances, the prohibition is cancelled.&lt;ref&gt;Igros Moshe O.C. Pg. 243:2&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in the times of the Talmud having soy milk, or non-dairy creamer, during the same meal as meat would have been prohibited because it was likely to think that the person was in violation of the laws of kosher. However, since it is well known today that people use non-dairy creamer, there is no issue of marit ayin, and the prohibition is cancelled.

The '''Maxwell stress tensor''' (named after [[James Clerk Maxwell]]) is a symmetric second-order [[tensor]] used in [[classical electromagnetism]] to represent the interaction between electromagnetic forces and [[momentum|mechanical momentum]]. In simple situations, such as a point charge moving freely in a homogeneous magnetic field, it is easy to calculate the forces on the charge from the [[Lorentz force law]]. When the situation becomes more complicated, this ordinary procedure can become impossibly difficult, with equations spanning multiple lines. It is therefore convenient to collect many of these terms in the Maxwell stress tensor, and to use tensor arithmetic to find the answer to the problem at hand.

In the relativistic formulation of electromagnetism, the Maxwell's tensor appears as a part of the [[electromagnetic stress–energy tensor]] which is the electromagnetic component of the total [[stress–energy tensor]]. The latter describes the density and flux of energy and momentum in [[spacetime]].

==Motivation==
[[File:Lorentz force continuum.svg|200px|thumb|Lorentz force (per unit 3-volume) '''f''' on a continuous [[charge distribution]] ([[charge density]] ρ) in motion. The 3-[[current density]] '''J''' corresponds to the motion of the charge element ''dq'' in [[volume element]] ''dV'' and varies throughout the continuum.]]

As outlined below, the electromagnetic force is written in terms of '''E''' and '''B''', using [[vector calculus]] and [[Maxwell's equations]] symmetry in the terms containing '''E''' and '''B''' are sought for, and introducing the Maxwell stress tensor simplifies the result.

|}

{{ordered list
|1= Starting with the [[Lorentz force]] law
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F} = q(\mathbf{E} + \mathbf{v}\times\mathbf{B})&lt;/math&gt;
the force per unit volume is
:&lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{f} = \rho\mathbf{E} + \mathbf{J}\times\mathbf{B}
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
|2= Next, ρ and '''J''' can be replaced by the fields '''E''' and '''B''', using [[Gauss's law]] and [[Ampère's circuital law]]:
:&lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{f} = \epsilon_0 \left(\boldsymbol{\nabla}\cdot \mathbf{E} \right)\mathbf{E} + \frac{1}{\mu_0} \left(\boldsymbol{\nabla}\times \mathbf{B} \right) \times \mathbf{B} - \epsilon_0 \frac{\partial \mathbf{E}}{\partial t} \times \mathbf{B}\,
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
|3= The time derivative can be rewritten to something that can be interpreted physically, namely the [[Poynting vector]]. Using the [[product rule]] and [[Faraday's law of induction]] gives
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial}{\partial t} (\mathbf{E}\times\mathbf{B}) = \frac{\partial\mathbf{E}}{\partial t}\times \mathbf{B} + \mathbf{E} \times \frac{\partial\mathbf{B}}{\partial t} = \frac{\partial\mathbf{E}}{\partial t}\times \mathbf{B} - \mathbf{E} \times (\boldsymbol{\nabla}\times \mathbf{E})\,&lt;/math&gt;
and we can now rewrite '''f''' as
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{f} = \epsilon_0 \left(\boldsymbol{\nabla}\cdot \mathbf{E} \right)\mathbf{E} + \frac{1}{\mu_0} \left(\boldsymbol{\nabla}\times \mathbf{B} \right) \times \mathbf{B} - \epsilon_0 \frac{\partial}{\partial t}\left( \mathbf{E}\times \mathbf{B}\right) - \epsilon_0 \mathbf{E} \times (\boldsymbol{\nabla}\times \mathbf{E}),&lt;/math&gt;
then collecting terms with '''E''' and '''B''' gives
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{f} = \epsilon_0\left[  (\boldsymbol{\nabla}\cdot \mathbf{E} )\mathbf{E} - \mathbf{E} \times (\boldsymbol{\nabla}\times \mathbf{E}) \right] + \frac{1}{\mu_0} \left[ -  \mathbf{B}\times\left(\boldsymbol{\nabla}\times \mathbf{B} \right)  \right]
- \epsilon_0\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\left( \mathbf{E}\times \mathbf{B}\right).&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
|4= A term seems to be "missing" from the symmetry in '''E''' and '''B''', which can be achieved by inserting (∇ • '''B''')'''B''' because of [[Gauss' law for magnetism]]:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{f} = \epsilon_0\left[  (\boldsymbol{\nabla}\cdot \mathbf{E} )\mathbf{E} - \mathbf{E} \times (\boldsymbol{\nabla}\times \mathbf{E}) \right] + \frac{1}{\mu_0} \left[(\boldsymbol{\nabla}\cdot \mathbf{B} )\mathbf{B} -  \mathbf{B}\times\left(\boldsymbol{\nabla}\times \mathbf{B} \right)  \right]
- \epsilon_0\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\left( \mathbf{E}\times \mathbf{B}\right).&lt;/math&gt;
Eliminating the curls (which are fairly complicated to calculate), using the [[vector calculus identity]]
:&lt;math&gt;\tfrac{1}{2} \boldsymbol{\nabla} (\mathbf{A}\cdot\mathbf{A}) = \mathbf{A} \times (\boldsymbol{\nabla} \times \mathbf{A}) + (\mathbf{A} \cdot \boldsymbol{\nabla}) \mathbf{A}, &lt;/math&gt;
leads to:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{f} = \epsilon_0\left[  (\boldsymbol{\nabla}\cdot \mathbf{E} )\mathbf{E} + (\mathbf{E}\cdot\boldsymbol{\nabla}) \mathbf{E} \right] + \frac{1}{\mu_0} \left[(\boldsymbol{\nabla}\cdot \mathbf{B} )\mathbf{B} + (\mathbf{B}\cdot\boldsymbol{\nabla}) \mathbf{B} \right] - \frac{1}{2} \boldsymbol{\nabla}\left(\epsilon_0 E^2 + \frac{1}{\mu_0} B^2 \right)
- \epsilon_0\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\left( \mathbf{E}\times \mathbf{B}\right).&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
|5= This expression contains every aspect of electromagnetism and momentum and is relatively easy to compute. It can be written more compactly by introducing the '''Maxwell stress tensor''',
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_{i j} \equiv \epsilon_0 \left(E_i E_j - \frac{1}{2} \delta_{ij} E^2\right) + \frac{1}{\mu_0}  \left(B_i B_j - \frac{1}{2} \delta_{ij} B^2\right).&lt;/math&gt;
All but the last term of f can be written as the tensor [[divergence]] of the maxwell stress tensor, giving:
:&lt;math&gt;\nabla \cdot \mathbf{\sigma} = \mathbf{f}  + \epsilon_0 \mu_0 \frac{\partial \mathbf{S}}{\partial t}\,&lt;/math&gt;,

As in the [[Poynting's theorem]], the second term on the right side of the above equation can be interpreted as the time derivative of the EM field's momentum density, while the first term is the time derivative of the momentum density for the massive particles.  In this way, the above equation will be the law of conservation of momentum in classical electrodynamics.

where the [[Poynting vector]] has been introduced
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{S} = \frac{1}{\mu_0}\mathbf{E}\times\mathbf{B}.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
}}

in the above relation for conservation of momentum,  &lt;math&gt;\nabla \cdot \mathbf{\sigma}&lt;/math&gt; is the '''momentum flux density''' and plays a role similar to &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{S}&lt;/math&gt; in [[Poynting's theorem]].

The above derivation assumes complete knowledge of both ρ and '''J''' (both free and bounded charges and currents). For the case of nonlinear materials (such as magnetic iron with a BH-curve), the nonlinear Maxwell stress tensor must be used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ggaaAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT81&amp;lpg=PT81&amp;dq=is+maxwell+stress+tensor+correct+for+nonlinear+steel&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Ln8aI46_ya&amp;sig=CXzs9vU-hUXY--Mn8ssR4GuMohg&amp;hl=sv&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjggMizl9nSAhXJ2SwKHXNKCXQQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=is%20maxwell%20stress%20tensor%20correct%20for%20nonlinear%20steel&amp;f=false|title=Magnetic Actuators and Sensors|last=Brauer|first=John R.|date=2014-01-13|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=9781118754979|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Equation==
In [[physics]], the '''Maxwell stress tensor''' is the stress tensor of an [[electromagnetic field]]. As derived above in [[SI unit]]s, it is given by:
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_{i j}  = \epsilon_0 E_i  E_j   + \frac{1}
{{\mu _0 }}B_i  B_j   - \frac{1}{2}\bigl( {\epsilon_0 E^2  + \tfrac{1}
{{\mu _0 }}B^2 } \bigr)\delta _{ij} &lt;/math&gt;,
where ε&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[electric constant]] and μ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[magnetic constant]], '''E''' is the [[electric field]], '''B''' is the [[magnetic field]] and δ&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt; is [[Kronecker's delta]]. In Gaussian [[cgs unit]], it is given by:
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_{i j}=\frac{1}{4\pi}\left(E_{i}E_{j}+H_{i}H_{j}-
\frac{1}{2}(E^2+H^2)\delta_{ij}\right)&lt;/math&gt;,
where '''H''' is the [[magnetizing field]].

An alternative way of expressing this tensor is:
:&lt;math&gt;
\overset{\leftrightarrow  }{ \mathbf{\sigma} } = \frac{1}{4\pi} \left[ \mathbf{E}\otimes\mathbf{E} + \mathbf{H}\otimes\mathbf{H} - \frac{E^2+H^2 }{2}\mathbb{I} \right]
&lt;/math&gt;
where ⊗ is the [[dyadic product]], and the last tensor is the unit dyad::

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathbb{I}
\equiv
\left(
\begin{array}{ccc}
1&amp;0&amp;0\\
0&amp;1&amp;0\\
0&amp;0&amp;1
\end{array}
\right)
=
(\mathbf{\hat x}\otimes\mathbf{\hat x} + \mathbf{\hat y}\otimes\mathbf{\hat y} + \mathbf{\hat z}\otimes\mathbf{\hat z})
&lt;/math&gt;

The element ''ij'' of the Maxwell stress tensor has units of momentum per unit of area per unit time and gives the flux of momentum parallel to the ''i''th axis crossing a surface normal to the ''j''th axis (in the negative direction) per unit of time.

These units can also be seen as units of force per unit of area (negative pressure), and the ''ij'' element of the tensor can also be interpreted as the force parallel to the ''i''th axis suffered by a surface normal to the jth axis per unit of area. Indeed, the diagonal elements give the [[tension (physics)|tension]] (pulling) acting on a differential area element normal to the corresponding axis. Unlike forces due to the pressure of an ideal gas, an area element in the electromagnetic field also feels a force in a direction that is not normal to the element. This shear is given by the off-diagonal elements of the stress tensor.

==Magnetism only==
If the field is only magnetic (which is largely true in motors, for instance), some of the terms drop out, and the equation in SI units becomes:
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_{i j} = \frac{1}{\mu_0} B_i B_j - \frac{1}{2 \mu_0} B^2 \delta_{i j} \,.&lt;/math&gt;

For cylindrical objects, such as the rotor of a motor, this is further simplified to:
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_{r t} = \frac{1}{\mu_0} B_r B_t - \frac{1}{2 \mu_0} B^2 \delta_{r t} \,.&lt;/math&gt;

where ''r'' is the shear in the radial (outward from the cylinder) direction, and ''t'' is the shear in the tangential (around the cylinder) direction. It is the tangential force which spins the motor. ''B''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt; is the flux density in the radial direction, and ''B''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt; is the flux density in the tangential direction.

==In Electrostatics==

In [[electrostatics]] the effects of magnetism are not present. In this case the magnetic field vanishes, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{B} = \mathbf{0}&lt;/math&gt;, and we obtain the ''electrostatic Maxwell stress tensor''. It is given in component form by

&lt;math&gt;
\sigma_{ij} = \varepsilon_0E_iE_j - \frac12\varepsilon_0E^2\delta_{ij}
&lt;/math&gt;

and in symbolic form by

&lt;math&gt;
\boldsymbol{\sigma} = \varepsilon_0\mathbf{E}\otimes\mathbf{E} - \frac12\varepsilon_0(\mathbf{E} \cdot \mathbf{E})\mathbf{I}
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{I}&lt;/math&gt; is the appropriate identity tensor (usually &lt;math&gt;3\times3&lt;/math&gt;).

==Eigenvalue==
The eigenvalues of the Maxwell stress tensor are given by:{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}
:&lt;math&gt;\{ \lambda \} = \left\{ - \frac{ \epsilon_0 E^2 + B^2 / \mu_0 }{2} ,~ \pm \sqrt{ \left( \frac{ \epsilon_0 E^2 - B^2 / \mu_0 }{2} \right)^2 + \frac{\epsilon_0}{\mu_0}\left( \boldsymbol{E} \cdot \boldsymbol{B} \right)^2} \right\}&lt;/math&gt;

These eigenvalues are obtained by iteratively applying the [[Matrix determinant lemma|Matrix Determinant Lemma]], in conjunction with the [[Sherman-Morrison Formula]].

Noting that the characteristic equation matrix, &lt;math&gt;\overleftrightarrow{\sigma} - \lambda\mathbf{\mathbb{I}}&lt;/math&gt;, can be written as

&lt;math&gt;\overleftrightarrow{\sigma} - \lambda\mathbf{\mathbb{I}} = -\left(\lambda+ V\right)\mathbf{\mathbb{I}} + \epsilon_0\mathbf{E}\mathbf{E}^T + \frac{\mathbf{B}\mathbf{B}^T}{\mu_0}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;V = \frac{1}{2}\left(\epsilon_0 E^2 + B^2 / \mu_0\right)&lt;/math&gt;

we set

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{U} = -\left(\lambda+ V\right)\mathbf{\mathbb{I}} + \epsilon_0\mathbf{E}\mathbf{E}^T&lt;/math&gt;

Applying the Matrix Determinant Lemma once, this gives us

&lt;math&gt;\det{\left(\overleftrightarrow{\sigma} - \lambda\mathbf{\mathbb{I}}\right)} = \left(1 + \mu_0^{-1}\mathbf{B}^T\mathbf{U}^{-1}\mathbf{B}\right)\det{\left(\mathbf{U}\right)}&lt;/math&gt;

Applying it again yields,

&lt;math&gt;\det{\left(\overleftrightarrow{\sigma} - \lambda\mathbf{\mathbb{I}}\right)} = \left(1 + \mu_0^{-1}\mathbf{B}^T\mathbf{U}^{-1}\mathbf{B}\right) \left( 1 - \frac{\epsilon_0\mathbf{E}^T\mathbf{E}}{\left( \lambda+ V \right)} \right)\left( -\lambda- V \right)^3&lt;/math&gt;

From the last multiplicand on the RHS, we immediately see that &lt;math&gt;\lambda=-V&lt;/math&gt; is one of the eigenvalues.

To find the inverse of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{U}&lt;/math&gt;, we use the Sherman-Morrison formula:

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{U}^{-1}=-\left(\lambda+ V\right)^{-1} - \frac{\epsilon_0 \mathbf{E}\mathbf{E}^T}{\left(\lambda+V\right)^2 - \left(\lambda+V\right)\left(\epsilon_0\mathbf{E}^T\mathbf{E}\right)} &lt;/math&gt;

Factoring out a &lt;math&gt;\left( -\lambda- V \right)&lt;/math&gt; term in the determinant, we are left with finding the zeros of the rational function:

&lt;math&gt;\left(-\left( \lambda+ V \right) - \frac{\epsilon_0\left(\mathbf{E}\cdot\mathbf{B}\right)^2}{\mu_0\left(-\left(\lambda+ V\right) + \epsilon_0\mathbf{E}^T\mathbf{E} \right)} \right) \left( -\left(\lambda+ V\right) + \epsilon_0\mathbf{E}^T\mathbf{E} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, once we solve

&lt;math&gt;-\left( \lambda+ V \right)\left(-\left(\lambda+ V\right) + \epsilon_0E^2 \right) - \frac{\epsilon_0\left(\mathbf{E}\cdot\mathbf{B}\right)^2}{\mu_0} = 0&lt;/math&gt;

we obtain the other two eigenvalues.

'''Moral intelligence''' is the capacity to [[understanding|understand]] right from wrong and to behave based on the value that is believed to be right.&lt;ref name="Langkah"&gt;'''[http://www.micheleborba.com/Pages/7virtues.htm The Step-By-Step Plan to Building Moral Intelligence]'''[http://www.micheleborba.com/Pages/7virtues.htm .] Retrieved 28 April 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Moral intelligence was first developed as a concept in 2005 by Doug Lennick and Fred Kiel, Ph.D. Much of the research involved with moral intelligence agrees that this characteristic is ability-based, rather than trait-based. Therefore, moral intelligence is seen as a skill that can be further developed with practice. Beheshtifar, Esmaeli, and Moghadam (2011) claim that moral intelligence is the “’central intelligence’ for all humans.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It is considered a distinct form of intelligence, independent to both emotional and cognitive intelligence.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Models of Moral Intelligence ==
There are two general 'models' of moral intelligence that are recurrent in the literature.

Doug Lennick and Fred Kiel, Ph.D., authors of ''Moral Intelligence'' and the originators of the term, identified four competencies of moral intelligence: integrity, responsibility, forgiveness, and compassion.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
{| class="wikitable"
!Lennick &amp; Kiel's competencies
!Description
|-
|Integrity
|Creating harmony between what we believe and how we act, doing what we know is right, always telling the truth
|-
|Responsibility
|Taking personal responsibility, admitting mistakes and failures, embracing responsibility for serving others    
|-
|Forgiveness
|Letting go of one’s own mistakes, letting go of others’ mistakes    
|-
|Compassion
|Actively caring about others    
|}

Another identified model of moral intelligence was proposed by author Michele Borba, Ed.D., in her book ''Building Moral Intelligence: The Seven Essential Virtues that Teach Kids to Do the Right Thing.'' Borba notes seven essential virtues of moral intelligence: empathy, conscience, self-control, respect, kindness, tolerance, and fairness.&lt;ref name="Langkah" /&gt; In her book, Borba gives a step-by-step plan for parents to teach their children these virtues to enhance their moral intelligence.

== Moral Intelligence and Leadership ==
Moral intelligence is proposedly an important characteristic for leaders to have. Beheshtifar, Esmaeli, and Moghadam (2011) studied the effects of moral intelligence on leadership and identified that moral intelligence affects the overall performance of an organization because leaders who are morally intelligent are more committed, continuously learn from others around them, are more humble, and more willing to risk their own self-interests for the greater good of moral goals.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Beheshtifar, M., Esmaeli, Z., &amp; Moghadam, M. N. (2011). Effect of moral intelligence on leadership. ''European Journal of Economics, Finance and Administrative Sciences, 43,'' 6-11.&lt;/ref&gt; Beheshtifar and colleagues argue that moral intelligence provides a “great potential to improve our understanding of learning and behavior,” and in particular within leadership roles.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; According to their research, moral intelligence is the driving force of our other forms of intelligences. Rahimi (2011) claims that humans are born with a natural moral instinct and that moral decisions are made rapidly and subconsciously. Beheshtifar and colleagues believe that within this moral instinct lies “inaccessible moral knowledge.”

Beheshtifar, Esmaeli, and Modhadam (2011) reported that there is a significant amount of research to support that leadership effectiveness is positively correlated with intelligence.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This means that more intelligent people are likely to be good leaders. However, the researchers suggest that smarter people are not always the best or most efficient leaders. They even go as far as to claim that other studies have found that “being much smarter than your subordinates can actually hinder effective leadership” due to the level of communication between the leaders and followers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Although moral intelligence is often highly associated with the business world, Beheshtifar and colleagues agree that this form of intelligence does not lie solely in the field of business psychology.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Moral Intelligence and Education ==
Education has been said to be a “moral endeavor.”&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Clarken, R.H., 2009. “Moral Intelligence in the Schools”. School of Education, Northern Michigan University. PP. 1-7.&lt;/ref&gt; The Association of Supervision and Curriculum Development (ASCD) stated during a panel on moral education that schools should define and teach universal moral values as part of the curriculum.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Rodney H. Clarken of the Northern Michigan University School of Education argued that moral intelligence must be taught to children by breaking it down into three different domains: cognitive, affective, and conative.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The cognitive domain is used to understand and develop a sense of moral intelligence by teaching children right from wrong, practical application of virtues, and exercising moral problem solving. The affective domain is an approach to develop moral intelligence through sense of when a situation is a moral dilemma, knowing how to respond to a problem appropriately, and learning how to develop a set of values. Lastly, the conative domain includes setting goals, and taking action and persevering.

By combining these omes into a set of omes, scientists can analyze complex biololgical [[big data]] efficiently enough to easily find relevant [[biomarkers]]. In so doing, multiomics integrates diverse omics data to find a coherently matching geno-pheno-envirotype relationship or association, even with reduced numbers of samples, although multiomics usually involves 'big' data.

Usually, a very large number of samples is required to detect functional relationships, but, using multiomics, encompassing multiple data types, researchers try to detect such associations with more confidence. A possible example case would be suicide [[biomarker]] detection by taking the blood of [[Major depressive disorder|depressive]] patients and performing genomic, transcriptomic, and epigenomic sequencing, combining these omes to find significant markers from the case population.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1585">In the [[history of ideas]] the '''New Learning''' in Europe is the [[Renaissance humanism]], developed in the later fifteenth century. Newly retrieved classical texts sparked [[philology|philological]] study of a refined and classical Latin style in prose and poetry. 

The term came to refer to other trends, one being the new formulation of the relationship between the [[Christian Church|Church]] and the individual arising from the [[Protestant Revolution]].{{Fact|date=March 2009}} Contemporaries noticed this: [[Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk]] lamented "It was merry in England afore the new learning came up", in relation to reading the Bible.&lt;ref&gt;W. A. Sessions, ''Henry Howard, the Poet Earl of Surrey: A Life'' (1999), p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

An earlier 'new learning' had a similar cause, two centuries earlier. In that case it was new texts of [[Aristotle]] that were discovered, with a major impact on [[scholasticism]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Cambridge History of Later Medieval Philosophy: From the Rediscovery of Aristotle to the Disintegration of Scholasticism, 1100-1600'' (1988), p. 521.&lt;/ref&gt; A later phase of the New Learning of the Renaissance concerned the beginnings of modern scientific thought. Here [[Francis Bacon]] is pointed to as an important reference point and catalyst.&lt;ref&gt;Joyce Appleby, ''Knowledge and Postmodernism in Historical Perspective'' (1996), p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

The green planet moves three times faster and thus requires a stronger [[centripetal force]], which is supplied by adding an attractive inverse-cube force. The red planet is stationary; the force ''F''(''r'') is balanced by a repulsive inverse-cube force.

[[File:Newton revolving orbits.svg|thumb|right|250px|Figure&amp;nbsp;2: The radius ''r'' of the green and blue planets are the same, but their [[angular speed]] differs by a factor ''k''. Examples of such orbits are shown in Figures&amp;nbsp;1 and 3–5.]]

In [[classical mechanics]], '''Newton's theorem of revolving orbits''' identifies the type of [[central force]] needed to multiply the [[angular speed]] of a particle by a factor ''k'' without affecting its radial motion (Figures&amp;nbsp;1 and 2). Newton applied his theorem to understanding the overall rotation of orbits (''[[Precession (astronomy)#Anomalistic precession|apsidal precession]]'', Figure&amp;nbsp;3) that is observed for the [[Moon]] and [[planet]]s. The term "radial motion" signifies the motion towards or away from the center of force, whereas the angular motion is perpendicular to the radial motion.

[[Isaac Newton]] derived this theorem in Propositions 43–45 of Book I of his ''[[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]'', first published in 1687. In Proposition 43, he showed that the added force must be a central force, one whose magnitude depends only upon the distance ''r'' between the particle and a point fixed in space (the center). In Proposition 44, he derived a formula for the force, showing that it was an inverse-cube force, one that varies as the inverse cube of ''r''. In Proposition 45 Newton extended his theorem to arbitrary central forces by assuming that the particle moved in nearly circular orbit.

As noted by astrophysicist [[Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar]] in his 1995 commentary on Newton's ''Principia'', this theorem remained largely unknown and undeveloped for over three centuries.&lt;ref name="Chandrasekhar, p. 183"&gt;Chandrasekhar, p. 183.&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1997, the theorem has been studied by [[Donald Lynden-Bell]] and collaborators.&lt;ref name="lynden_bell_1997" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lynden_bell_2008" /&gt; Its first exact extension came in 2000 with the work of Mahomed and Vawda.&lt;ref name="mahomed_2000" /&gt;

==Historical context==
[[File:Retrograde Motion.bjb.svg|thumb|left|300px|Retrograde motion of [[Mars]] as viewed from the Earth.]]

[[File:Newton revolving orbit e0.6 precession.ogg|thumb|left|300px|Figure&amp;nbsp;3: Planets revolving the Sun follow elliptical (oval) orbits that rotate gradually over time (''apsidal precession''). The [[orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]] of this ellipse is exaggerated for visualization. Most orbits in the Solar System have a much smaller eccentricity, making them nearly circular. A [[Graphics Interchange Format|GIF]] version of this animation is found [[:Image:Precessing Kepler orbit 280frames e0.6 smaller.gif|here]].]]

The motion of astronomical bodies has been studied systematically for thousands of years. The stars were observed to rotate uniformly, always maintaining the same relative positions to one another. However, other bodies were observed to ''wander'' against the background of the fixed stars; most such bodies were called [[planet]]s after the Greek word "πλανήτοι" (''planētoi'') for "wanderers". Although they generally move in the same direction along a path across the sky (the [[ecliptic]]), individual planets sometimes reverse their direction briefly, exhibiting [[retrograde motion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

To describe this forward-and-backward motion, [[Apollonius of Perga]] ({{nowrap|c. 262 – c. 190 BC}}&lt;!--or 280 BC – c. 210 BC from the Cambridge Encyclopedia 2005--&gt;) developed the concept of [[deferent and epicycle|deferents and epicycles]], according to which the planets are carried on rotating circles that are themselves carried on other rotating circles, and so on. Any orbit can be described with a sufficient number of judiciously chosen epicycles, since this approach corresponds to a modern [[Fourier transform]].&lt;ref name="sugon_2008"&gt;Sugon QM, Bragais S, McNamara DJ (2008) [https://arxiv.org/abs/0807.2708v1 Copernicus’s epicycles from Newton’s gravitational force law via linear perturbation theory in geometric algebra].&lt;/ref&gt; Roughly 350 years later, [[Ptolemy|Claudius Ptolemaeus]] published his ''[[Almagest]]'', in which he developed this system to match the best astronomical observations of his era. To explain the epicycles, Ptolemy adopted the [[geocentric model|geocentric]] cosmology of [[Aristotle]], according to which planets were confined to concentric rotating spheres. This model of the [[universe]] was authoritative for nearly 1500 years.

The modern understanding of planetary motion arose from the combined efforts of astronomer [[Tycho Brahe]] and physicist [[Johannes Kepler]] in the 16th century. Tycho is credited with extremely accurate measurements of planetary motions, from which Kepler was able to derive his [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion|laws of planetary motion]].&lt;ref name=Heilbron11&gt;{{Harvnb|Heilbron|2005|pp=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to these laws, planets move on [[ellipse]]s (not [[epicycles]]) about the [[Sun]] (not the Earth). Kepler's second and third laws make specific quantitative predictions: planets sweep out equal areas in equal time, and the square of their [[orbital period]]s equals a fixed constant times the cube of their [[semi-major axis]].&lt;ref name=Fitzpartrick41&gt;{{Harvnb|Fitzpartrick|2012|pp=41–43}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent observations of the planetary orbits showed that the long axis of the ellipse (the so-called ''line of apsides'') rotates gradually with time; this rotation is known as ''apsidal precession''. The [[apsis|apses]] of an orbit are the points at which the orbiting body is closest or furthest away from the attracting center; for planets orbiting the Sun, the apses correspond to the perihelion (closest) and aphelion (furthest).&lt;ref name=Lambourne204&gt;{{Harvnb|Lambourne|2010|pp=204–205}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the publication of his ''[[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia]]'' roughly eighty years later (1687), [[Isaac Newton]] provided a physical theory that accounted for all three of Kepler's laws, a theory based on [[Newton's laws of motion]] and his [[Newton's law of universal gravitation|law of universal gravitation]]. In particular, Newton proposed that the gravitational force between any two bodies was a [[central force]] ''F''(''r'') that varied as the [[inverse-square law|inverse square]] of the distance ''r'' between them. Arguing from his laws of motion, Newton showed that the orbit of any particle acted upon by one such force is always a [[conic section]], specifically an ellipse if it does not go to infinity. However, this conclusion holds only when two bodies are present (the [[two-body problem]]); the motion of three bodies or more acting under their mutual gravitation (the [[n-body problem|''n''-body problem]]) remained unsolved for centuries after Newton,&lt;ref&gt;Whittaker, pp. 339–385.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sundman_1912"&gt;{{cite journal| authorlink = Karl F. Sundman|author= Sundman KF| year = 1912| title = Memoire sur le probleme de trois corps| journal = Acta Mathematica| volume = 36| issue = 1| pages = 105–179| doi = 10.1007/BF02422379}}&lt;/ref&gt; although solutions to a few [[Euler's three-body problem|special cases]] were discovered.&lt;ref name="hiltebeitel_1911"&gt;{{cite journal| author = Hiltebeitel AM| year = 1911| title = On the Problem of Two Fixed Centres and Certain of its Generalizations| journal = American Journal of Mathematics| volume = 33| pages = 337–362| doi = 10.2307/2369997| issue = 1/4| publisher = The Johns Hopkins University Press| jstor = 2369997}}&lt;/ref&gt; Newton proposed that the orbits of planets about the Sun are largely elliptical because the Sun's gravitation is dominant; to [[orders of approximation|first approximation]], the presence of the other planets can be ignored. By analogy, the elliptical orbit of the [[Moon]] about the Earth was dominated by the Earth's gravity; to first approximation, the Sun's gravity and those of other bodies of the Solar System can be neglected. However, Newton stated that the gradual apsidal precession of the planetary and lunar orbits was due to the effects of these neglected interactions; in particular, he stated that the precession of the Moon's orbit was due to the perturbing effects of gravitational interactions with the Sun.&lt;ref name=Heilbron139&gt;{{Harvnb|Heilbron|2005|pp=139}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Newton's theorem of revolving orbits was his first attempt to understand apsidal precession quantitatively. According to this theorem, the addition of a particular type of central force—the inverse-cube force—can produce a rotating orbit; the angular speed is multiplied by a factor ''k'', whereas the radial motion is left unchanged. However, this theorem is restricted to a specific type of force that may not be relevant; several perturbing inverse-square interactions (such as those of other planets) seem unlikely to sum exactly to an inverse-cube force. To make his theorem applicable to other types of forces, Newton found the best approximation of an arbitrary central force ''F''(''r'') to an inverse-cube potential in the limit of nearly circular orbits, that is, elliptical orbits of low eccentricity, as is indeed true for most orbits in the Solar System. To find this approximation, Newton developed an infinite series that can be viewed as the forerunner of the [[Taylor expansion]].&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, p. 147.&lt;/ref&gt; This approximation allowed Newton to estimate the rate of precession for arbitrary central forces. Newton applied this approximation to test models of the force causing the apsidal precession of the Moon's orbit. However, the problem of the Moon's motion is dauntingly complex, and Newton never published an accurate gravitational model of the Moon's apsidal precession. After a more accurate model by [[Alexis Claude Clairaut|Clairaut]] in 1747,&lt;ref name="clairaut_1747" &gt;{{cite journal| last = Clairaut| first = AC| authorlink = Alexis Clairaut| year = 1745| title = Du Système du Monde dans les principes de la gravitation universelle| journal = Histoire de l'Académie royale des sciences avec les mémoires de mathématique et de physique| volume = 1749| pages = 329–364| url=http://visualiseur.bnf.fr/CadresFenetre?O=NUMM-3543&amp;M=chemindefer}}&lt;/ref&gt; analytical models of the Moon's motion were developed in the late 19th century by [[George William Hill|Hill]],&lt;ref name="hill"&gt;{{cite journal| author = [[George William Hill|Hill GW]]| year = 1894| title = Literal expression for the motion of the moon's perigee| journal = Ann.

However, Newton's theorem is more general than merely explaining apsidal precession. It describes the effects of adding an inverse-cube force to any central force ''F''(''r''), not only to inverse-square forces such as [[Newton's law of universal gravitation]] and [[Coulomb's law]]. Newton's theorem simplifies orbital problems in [[classical mechanics]] by eliminating inverse-cube forces from consideration. The radial and angular motions, ''r''(''t'') and ''θ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''t''), can be calculated without the inverse-cube force; afterwards, its effect can be calculated by multiplying the angular speed of the particle

:&lt;math&gt;
\omega_{2} = \frac{d\theta_{2}}{dt} = k \frac{d\theta_{1}}{dt} = k \omega_{1}.
&lt;/math&gt;

Consider a particle moving under an arbitrary [[central force]] ''F''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''r'') whose magnitude depends only on the distance ''r'' between the particle and a fixed center. Since the motion of a particle under a central force always lies in a plane, the position of the particle can be described by [[polar coordinate system|polar coordinates]] (''r'',&amp;nbsp;''θ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;), the radius and angle of the particle relative to the center of force (Figure&amp;nbsp;1). Both of these coordinates, ''r''(''t'') and ''θ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''t''), change with time ''t'' as the particle moves.

Imagine a second particle with the same mass ''m'' and with the same radial motion ''r''(''t''), but one whose angular speed is ''k'' times faster than that of the first particle. In other words, the [[azimuthal angle]]s of the two particles are related by the equation ''θ''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''t'') = ''k&amp;nbsp;θ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''t''). Newton showed that the motion of the second particle can be produced by adding an inverse-cube central force to whatever force ''F''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''r'') acts on the first particle&lt;ref&gt;Newton, ''[[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia]]'', section IX of Book I, Propositions 43–45, pp. 135–147.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
F_2(r) - F_1(r) = \frac{L_1^2}{mr^3} \left( 1 - k^2 \right)
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''L''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is the magnitude of the first particle's [[angular momentum]], which is a [[constant of motion]] (conserved) for central forces.

If ''k''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is greater than one, ''F''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''F''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is a negative number; thus, the added inverse-cube force is ''attractive'', as observed in the green planet of Figures&amp;nbsp;1–4 and 9. By contrast, if ''k''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is less than one, ''F''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;−''F''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is a positive number; the added inverse-cube force is ''repulsive'', as observed in the green planet of Figures&amp;nbsp;5 and 10, and in the red planet of Figures&amp;nbsp;4 and 5.

===Alteration of the particle path===
The addition of such an inverse-cube force also changes the ''path'' followed by the particle. The path of the particle ignores the time dependencies of the radial and angular motions, such as ''r''(''t'') and ''θ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''t''); rather, it relates the radius and angle variables to one another. For this purpose, the angle variable is unrestricted and can increase indefinitely as the particle revolves around the central point multiple times. For example, if the particle revolves twice about the central point and returns to its starting position, its final angle is not the same as its initial angle; rather, it has increased by {{nowrap|2×360° {{=}} 720°}}. Formally, the angle variable is defined as the integral of the angular speed

:&lt;math&gt;
\theta_1 \equiv \int \omega_1(t)\, dt.
&lt;/math&gt;

A similar definition holds for ''θ''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, the angle of the second particle.

If the path of the first particle is described in the form {{nowrap|''r'' {{=}} ''g''(''θ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)}}, the path of the second particle is given by the function {{nowrap|''r'' {{=}} ''g''(θ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/''k'')}}, since {{nowrap|''θ''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} ''k θ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}. For example, let the path of the first particle be an [[ellipse]]

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{1}{r} = A + B \cos \theta_1
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''A'' and ''B'' are constants; then, the path of the second particle is given by

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{1}{r} = A + B \cos \left( \frac{\theta_2}{k} \right).
&lt;/math&gt;

==Orbital precession==
If ''k'' is close, but not equal, to one, the second orbit resembles the first, but revolves gradually about the center of force; this is known as [[precession (astronomy)#Anomalistic precession|orbital precession]] (Figure&amp;nbsp;3). If ''k'' is greater than one, the orbit precesses in the same direction as the orbit (Figure&amp;nbsp;3); if ''k'' is less than one, the orbit precesses in the opposite direction.

Although the orbit in Figure&amp;nbsp;3 may seem to rotate uniformly, i.e., at a constant angular speed, this is true only for circular orbits.&lt;ref name="lynden_bell_1997" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lynden_bell_2008"&gt;{{cite journal| author = Lynden-Bell D, Jin S| year = 2008| title = Analytic central orbits and their transformation group| journal = [[Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society]]| volume = 386| issue = 1| pages = 245–260| doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2966.2008.13018.x| bibcode=2008MNRAS.386..245L|arxiv = 0711.3491 }}&lt;/ref&gt; If the orbit rotates at an angular speed ''Ω'', the angular speed of the second particle is faster or slower than that of the first particle by ''Ω''; in other words, the angular speeds would satisfy the equation {{nowrap|''ω''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} ''ω''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + Ω}}. However, Newton's theorem of revolving orbits states that the angular speeds are related by multiplication: {{nowrap|''ω''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} ''kω''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}, where ''k'' is a constant. Combining these two equations shows that the angular speed of the precession equals {{nowrap|''Ω'' {{=}} (''k'' − 1)''ω''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}. Hence, ''Ω'' is constant only if ''ω''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is constant. According to the conservation of angular momentum, ''ω''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; changes with the radius ''r''

:&lt;math&gt;
\omega_{1} = \frac{L_{1}}{m r^{2}};
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''m'' and ''L''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; are the first particle's [[mass]] and [[angular momentum]], respectively, both of which are constant. Hence, ''ω''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is constant only if the radius ''r'' is constant, i.e., when the orbit is a circle. However, in that case, the orbit does not change as it precesses.

==Illustrative example: Cotes's spirals==
[[File:Impact parameter straight line.svg|thumb|right|Figure&amp;nbsp;6: For the blue particle moving in a straight line, the radius ''r'' from a given center varies with angle according to the equation {{nowrap|''b'' {{=}} ''r'' cos(θ − ''θ''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;)}}, where ''b'' is the distance of closest approach ([[impact parameter]], shown in red).]]

The simplest illustration of Newton's theorem occurs when there is no initial force, i.e., ''F''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''r'') = 0. In this case, the first particle is stationary or travels in a straight line. If it travels in a straight line that does not pass through the origin (blue line in Figure&amp;nbsp;6) the equation for such a line may be written in the polar coordinates (''r'', ''θ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) as

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{1}{r} = \frac{1}{b} \cos\ (\theta_1 - \theta_0)
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''θ''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the angle at which the distance is minimized (Figure&amp;nbsp;6). The distance ''r'' begins at infinity (when ''θ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; – {{nowrap|''θ''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} −90°}}), and decreases gradually until ''θ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; – {{nowrap|''θ''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} 0°}}, when the distance reaches a minimum, then gradually increases again to infinity at ''θ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; – {{nowrap|''θ''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} 90°}}. The minimum distance ''b'' is the [[impact parameter]], which is defined as the length of the perpendicular from the fixed center to the line of motion. The same radial motion is possible when an inverse-cube central force is added.

[[File:Epi half spirals.svg|thumb|left|150px|Figure 7: Epispirals corresponding to ''k'' equal to 2/3 (red), 1.0 (black), 1.5 (green), 3.0 (cyan) and 6.0 (blue). When ''k'' is less than one, the inverse-cube force is repulsive, whereas when ''k'' is greater than one, the force is attractive.]]

An inverse-cube central force ''F''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''r'') has the form

:&lt;math&gt;
F_2(r) = \frac{\mu}{r^3}
&lt;/math&gt;

where the numerator μ may be positive (repulsive) or negative (attractive). If such an inverse-cube force is introduced, Newton's theorem says that the corresponding solutions have a shape called [[Cotes's spiral]]s{{clarify|date=October 2016}}. These are curves defined by the equation&lt;ref name=Grossman139&gt;{{Harvnb|Grossman|1996|pp=33–34}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Shikin139&gt;{{Harvnb|Shikin|1995|pp=139–140}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{1}{r} = \frac{1}{b} \cos\ \left(\frac{\theta_2 - \theta_0}{k} \right)
&lt;/math&gt;

where the constant ''k'' equals

:&lt;math&gt;
k^2 = 1 - \frac{m \mu}{L_1^2}
&lt;/math&gt;

When the right-hand side of the equation is a positive [[real number]], the solution corresponds to an [[epispiral]].&lt;ref name=Lawrence192&gt;{{Harvnb|Lawrence|1972|pp=192–194}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the argument ''θ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; – ''θ''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; equals ±90°×''k'', the cosine goes to zero and the radius goes to infinity. Thus, when ''k'' is less than one, the range of allowed angles becomes small and the force is repulsive (red curve on right in Figure&amp;nbsp;7). On the other hand, when ''k'' is greater than one, the range of allowed angles increases, corresponding to an attractive force (green, cyan and blue curves on left in Figure&amp;nbsp;7); the orbit of the particle can even wrap around the center several times. The possible values of the parameter ''k'' may range from zero to infinity, which corresponds to values of μ ranging from negative infinity up to the positive upper limit, ''L''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/''m''. Thus, for all attractive inverse-cube forces (negative μ) there is a corresponding epispiral orbit, as for some repulsive ones (μ &lt; ''L''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/''m''), as illustrated in Figure&amp;nbsp;7. Stronger repulsive forces correspond to a faster linear motion.

[[File:Poinsot half spirals.svg|thumb|left|150px|Figure 8: [[Poinsot's spirals|Poinsot spirals]] ([[hyperbolic cosine|cosh]] spirals) corresponding to λ equal to 1.0 (green), 3.0 (cyan) and 6.0 (blue).]]

One of the other solution types is given in terms of the [[hyperbolic cosine]]:

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{1}{r} = \frac{1}{b} \cosh\ \left(\frac{\theta_0 - \theta_2}{\lambda} \right)
&lt;/math&gt;

where the constant λ satisfies

:&lt;math&gt;
\lambda^2 = \frac{m \mu}{L_1^{2}} - 1
&lt;/math&gt;

This form of Cotes's spirals corresponds to one of the two [[Poinsot's spirals]] (Figure&amp;nbsp;8).&lt;ref name=Lawrence192/&gt; The possible values of λ range from zero to infinity, which corresponds to values of μ greater than the positive number ''L''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/''m''. Thus, Poinsot spiral motion only occurs for repulsive inverse-cube central forces, and applies in the case that ''L'' is not too large for the given μ.

Taking the limit of ''k'' or λ going to zero yields the third form of a Cotes's spiral, the so-called ''reciprocal spiral'' or ''[[hyperbolic spiral]]'', as a solution&lt;ref name="Weisstein1427"&gt;{{Harvnb|Weisstein|2002|pp=1427}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{1}{r} = A \theta_2 + \varepsilon
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''A'' and ''ε'' are arbitrary constants. Such curves result when the strength μ of the repulsive force exactly balances the angular momentum-mass term

:&lt;math&gt;
\mu = \frac{L_{1}^{2}}{m}
&lt;/math&gt;

==Closed orbits and inverse-cube central forces==
[[File:Newton revolving orbits 1 2 3 6.svg|thumb|170px|right|Figure&amp;nbsp;9: Harmonic orbits with {{nowrap|''k'' {{=}} 1}} (blue), 2 (magenta) and 3 (green). An animation of the blue and green orbits is shown in Figure&amp;nbsp;4.]]

Two types of [[central force]]s—those that increase linearly with distance, ''F = Cr'', such as [[Hooke's law]], and inverse-square forces, {{nowrap|''F'' {{=}} ''C''/''r''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}, such as [[Newton's law of universal gravitation]] and [[Coulomb's law]]—have a very unusual property. A particle moving under either type of force always returns to its starting place with its initial velocity, provided that it lacks sufficient energy to move out to infinity. In other words, the path of a bound particle is always closed and its motion repeats indefinitely, no matter what its initial position or velocity. As shown by [[Bertrand's theorem]], this property is not true for other types of forces; in general, a particle will not return to its starting point with the same velocity.

However, Newton's theorem shows that an inverse-cubic force may be applied to a particle moving under a linear or inverse-square force such that its [[orbit (dynamics)|orbit]] remains closed, provided that ''k'' equals a [[rational number]]. (A number is called "rational" if it can be written as a fraction ''m''/''n'', where ''m'' and ''n'' are integers.) In such cases, the addition of the inverse-cubic force causes the particle to complete ''m'' rotations about the center of force in the same time that the original particle completes ''n'' rotations. This method for producing closed orbits does not violate Bertrand's theorem, because the added inverse-cubic force depends on the initial velocity of the particle.

[[File:Newton revolving orbits 1 inv2 inv3.svg|thumb|right|170px|Figure&amp;nbsp;10: Subharmonic orbits with {{nowrap|''k'' {{=}} 1}} (blue), 1/2 (magenta) and 1/3 (green). An animation of the blue and green orbits is shown in Figure&amp;nbsp;5.]]

Harmonic and subharmonic orbits are special types of such closed orbits. A closed trajectory is called a ''harmonic orbit'' if ''k'' is an integer, i.e., if {{nowrap|''n'' {{=}} 1}} in the formula {{nowrap|''k'' {{=}} ''m''/''n''}}. For example, if {{nowrap|''k'' {{=}} 3}} (green planet in Figures&amp;nbsp;1 and 4, green orbit in Figure&amp;nbsp;9), the resulting orbit is the third harmonic of the original orbit. Conversely, the closed trajectory is called a ''subharmonic orbit'' if ''k'' is the [[multiplicative inverse|inverse]] of an integer, i.e., if {{nowrap|''m'' {{=}} 1}} in the formula {{nowrap|''k'' {{=}} ''m''/''n''}}. For example, if {{nowrap|''k'' {{=}} 1/3}} (green planet in Figure&amp;nbsp;5, green orbit in Figure&amp;nbsp;10), the resulting orbit is called the third subharmonic of the original orbit. Although such orbits are unlikely to occur in nature, they are helpful for illustrating Newton's theorem.&lt;ref name="lynden_bell_1997"&gt;{{cite journal| last = Lynden-Bell| first = D|author2=Lynden-Bell RM | year = 1997| title = On the Shapes of Newton's Revolving Orbits| journal = Notes and Records of the Royal Society of London| volume = 51| issue = 2| pages = 195–198| doi = 10.1098/rsnr.1997.0016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Limit of nearly circular orbits==
In Proposition 45 of his ''Principia'', Newton applies his theorem of revolving orbits to develop a method for finding the force laws that govern the motions of planets.&lt;ref name=Chandrasekhar192/&gt; [[Johannes Kepler]] had noted that the orbits of most planets and the Moon seemed to be ellipses, and the long axis of those ellipses can determined accurately from astronomical measurements. The long axis is defined as the line connecting the positions of minimum and maximum distances to the central point, i.e., the line connecting the two [[apsis|apses]]. For illustration, the long axis of the planet [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] is defined as the line through its successive positions of perihelion and aphelion. Over time, the long axis of most orbiting bodies rotates gradually, generally no more than a few degrees per complete revolution, because of gravitational perturbations from other bodies, [[Oblate spheroid|oblateness in the attracting body]], [[Perihelion precession of Mercury|general relativistic effects]], and other effects. Newton's method uses this apsidal precession as a sensitive probe of the type of force being applied to the planets.&lt;ref name="valluri_1997"/&gt;

Newton's theorem describes only the effects of adding an inverse-cube central force. However, Newton extends his theorem to an arbitrary central forces ''F''(''r'') by restricting his attention to orbits that are nearly circular, such as ellipses with low [[orbital eccentricity]] (''ε''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;0.1), which is true of seven of the eight planetary orbits in the [[Solar System|solar system]]. Newton also applied his theorem to the planet Mercury,&lt;ref&gt;Newton, ''Principia'', Book III, Proposition 2, p. 406.&lt;/ref&gt; which has an eccentricity ''ε ''of roughly 0.21, and suggested that it may pertain to [[Halley's comet]], whose orbit has an eccentricity of roughly 0.97.&lt;ref name="valluri_1997" /&gt;

A qualitative justification for this extrapolation of his method has been suggested by Valluri, Wilson and Harper.&lt;ref name="valluri_1997" &gt;{{cite journal |author1=Valluri S. R. |author2=Wilson C. |author3=Harper W. | year = 1997| title = Newton's Apsidal Precession Theorem and Eccentric Orbits| journal = Journal for the History of Astronomy| volume = 28| pages = 13–27| bibcode = 1997JHA....28...13V | doi=10.1177/002182869702800102}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to their argument, Newton considered the apsidal precession angle α (the angle between the vectors of successive minimum and maximum distance from the center) to be a [[smooth function|smooth]], [[continuous function]] of the orbital eccentricity ε. For the inverse-square force, α equals 180°; the vectors to the positions of minimum and maximum distances lie on the same line. If α is initially not 180° at low ε (quasi-circular orbits) then, in general, α will equal 180° only for isolated values of ε; a randomly chosen value of ε would be very unlikely to give α = 180°. Therefore, the observed slow rotation of the apsides of planetary orbits suggest that the force of gravity is an inverse-square law.

===Quantitative formula===
To simplify the equations, Newton writes ''F''(''r'') in terms of a new function ''C''(''r'')

:&lt;math&gt;
F(r) = \frac{C(r)}{R r^3}
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''R'' is the average radius of the nearly circular orbit. Newton expands ''C''(''r'') in a series—now known as a [[Taylor expansion]]—in [[power series|powers]] of the distance ''r'', one of the first appearances of such a series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Cohen IB| year = 1990| chapter = Halley's Two Essays on Newton's ''Principia''| title = Standing on the Shoulders of Giants: A Longer View of Newton and Halley| editor = Norman Thrower, editor| publisher = University of California Press| location = Berkeley, CA| isbn = 978-0-520-06589-5| pages = 91–108}}&lt;/ref&gt; By equating the resulting inverse-cube force term with the inverse-cube force for revolving orbits, Newton derives an equivalent angular scaling factor ''k'' for nearly circular orbits：&lt;ref name=Chandrasekhar192&gt;{{Harvnb|Chandrasekhar S|1995|pp=192–194}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{1}{k^{2}} = \left( \frac{R}{C} \right) \left. \frac{dC}{dr} \right|_{r=R}
&lt;/math&gt;

In other words, the application of an arbitrary central force ''F''(''r'') to a nearly circular elliptical orbit can accelerate the angular motion by the factor ''k'' without affecting the radial motion significantly. If an elliptical orbit is stationary, the particle rotates about the center of force by 180° as it moves from one end of the long axis to the other (the two [[apse]]s). Thus, the corresponding apsidal angle ''α'' for a general central force equals ''k''×180°, using the general law {{nowrap|''θ''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} ''k'' ''θ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}.

===Examples===
Newton illustrates his formula with three examples. In the first two, the central force is a [[power law]], {{nowrap|''F''(''r'') {{=}} ''r''&lt;sup&gt;''n''−3&lt;/sup&gt;}} and, hence,''C''(''r'') is proportional to ''r''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;. The formula above indicates that the angular motion is multiplied by a factor {{nowrap|''k'' {{=}} 1/{{radic|''n''}}}}, so that the apsidal angle ''α'' equals 180°/{{radic|''n''}}.

This angular scaling can be seen in the apsidal precession, i.e., in the gradual rotation of the long axis of the ellipse (Figure&amp;nbsp;3). As noted above, the orbit as a whole rotates with a mean angular speed ''Ω''=(''k''−1)''ω'', where ''ω'' equals the mean angular speed of the particle about the stationary ellipse. If the particle requires a time ''T'' to move from one apse to the other, this implies that, in the same time, the long axis will rotate by an angle ''β''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;Ω''T''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;(''k''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1)''ωT''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;(''k''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1)×180°. For an [[inverse-square law]] such as [[Newton's law of universal gravitation]], where ''n'' equals 1, there is no angular scaling (''k''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1), the apsidal angle ''α'' is 180°, and the elliptical orbit is stationary (Ω&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''β''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0).

As a final illustration, Newton considers a sum of two power laws

:&lt;math&gt;
C(r) \propto a r^m + b r^n
&lt;/math&gt;

which multiplies the angular speed by a factor

:&lt;math&gt;
k = \sqrt{\frac{a + b}{am + bn}}
&lt;/math&gt;

Newton applies both of these formulae (the power law and sum of two power laws) to examine the apsidal precession of the Moon's orbit.

==Precession of the Moon's orbit==
[[File:Lunar libration with phase2.gif|thumb|350px|right|The Moon's motion is more complex than those of the planets, mainly due to the competing gravitational pulls of the Earth and the Sun.]]

The motion of the [[Moon]] can be measured accurately, and is noticeably more complex than that of the planets.&lt;ref name="cook_2000"&gt;{{cite journal| author = Cook A| year = 2000| title = Success and Failure in Newton's Lunar Theory| journal = Astronomy and Geophysics| volume = 41| pages = 21–25| bibcode = 2000A&amp;G....41f..21C| doi = 10.1046/j.1468-4004.2000.41621.x| issue = 6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ancient Greek astronomers, [[Hipparchus]] and [[Ptolemy]], had noted several periodic variations in the Moon's orbit,&lt;ref name="cook_2000" /&gt; such as small oscillations in its [[orbital eccentricity]] and the [[inclination]] of its orbit to the plane of the [[ecliptic]]. These oscillations generally occur on a once-monthly or twice-monthly time-scale. The line of its [[apsis|apses]] precesses gradually with a period of roughly 8.85 years, while its [[Longitude of the ascending node|line of nodes]] turns a full circle in roughly double that time, 18.6 years.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, p. 252.&lt;/ref&gt; This accounts for the roughly 18-year periodicity of [[eclipse]]s, the so-called [[Saros cycle]]. However, both lines experience small fluctuations in their motion, again on the monthly time-scale.

In 1673, [[Jeremiah Horrocks]] published a reasonably accurate model of the Moon's motion in which the Moon was assumed to follow a precessing elliptical orbit.&lt;ref name="horrocks_1673"&gt;{{cite book| author = [[Jeremiah Horrocks|Horrocks J]]| year = 1673| title = Jeremia Horocii opera posthuma| publisher = G Godbit for J Martyn| location = London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author = Wilson C| year = 1987| title = On the Origin of Horrock's Lunar Theory| journal = Journal for the History of Astronomy| volume = 18| pages = 77–94|bibcode = 1987JHA....18...77W }}&lt;/ref&gt; A sufficiently accurate and simple method for predicting the Moon's motion would have solved the navigational problem of determining a ship's [[longitude]];&lt;ref name="kollerstrom_2000"&gt;{{cite book| author = Kollerstrom N| year = 2000| title = Newton's Forgotten Lunar Theory: His Contribution to the Quest for Longitude| publisher = Green Lion Press| isbn = 978-1-888009-08-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Newton's time, the goal was to predict the Moon's position to 2' (two [[minute of arc|arc-minutes]]), which would correspond to a 1° error in terrestrial longitude.&lt;ref name="smith_254" &gt;Smith, p. 254.&lt;/ref&gt; Horrocks' model predicted the lunar position with errors no more than 10 arc-minutes;&lt;ref name="smith_254" /&gt; for comparison, the diameter of the Moon is roughly 30 arc-minutes.

Newton used his theorem of revolving orbits in two ways to account for the apsidal precession of the Moon.&lt;ref name="newton_45" &gt;Newton, ''Principia'', Book I, Section IX, Proposition 45, pp. 141–147.&lt;/ref&gt; First, he showed that the Moon's observed apsidal precession could be accounted for by changing the [[Newton's law of universal gravitation|force law of gravity]] from an inverse-square law to a [[power law]] in which the exponent was {{nowrap|2 + 4/243}} (roughly 2.0165)&lt;ref&gt;Chandrasekhar, p. 198.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
F(r) = - \frac{GMm}{r^{2 + 4/243}}
&lt;/math&gt;

In 1894, [[Asaph Hall]] adopted this approach of modifying the exponent in the inverse-square law slightly to explain an anomalous orbital [[precession]] of the [[planet]] [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]],&lt;ref name="hall_1894" &gt;{{cite journal| author = Hall A| year = 1894| title = A suggestion in the theory of Mercury| journal = The Astronomical Journal| volume = 14| pages = 49–51| doi = 10.1086/102055| bibcode=1894AJ.....14...49H}}&lt;/ref&gt; which had been observed in 1859 by [[Urbain Le Verrier]].&lt;ref name="le_verrier" &gt;{{cite journal| author = [[Urbain Le Verrier|Le Verrier UJJ]]| year = 1859| title = Théorie du mouvement de Mercure| journal = Annales de l'Observatoire Impérial de Paris| volume = 5| pages = 1–196, esp. 98–106| bibcode = 1859AnPar...5....1L}}&lt;br&gt;{{cite journal| author = [[Simon Newcomb]]| title = Discussion and Results of Observations on Transits of Mercury from 1677 to 1881| journal = Astronomical Papers Prepared for the Use of the American Ephemeris and Nautical Almanac| volume = 1| page = 473| bibcode = 1882USNAO...1..363N| year = 1882}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ironically, Hall's theory was ruled out by careful astronomical observations of the Moon.&lt;ref name="brown_1903" &gt;{{cite journal| author = Brown EW| year = 1903| title = On the degree of accuracy in the new lunary theory| journal = Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society| volume = 64| pages = 524–534 | doi = 10.1093/mnras/64.6.524 |bibcode = 1904MNRAS..64..524. }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Perihelion precession of Mercury|currently accepted explanation]] for this precession involves the theory of [[general relativity]], which (to [[Orders of approximation|first approximation]]) adds an inverse-quartic force, i.e., one that varies as the inverse fourth power of distance.&lt;ref name="roseveare_1982"&gt;{{cite book| author = Roseveare N| year = 1982| title = Mercury's perihelion from Le verrier to Einstein| publisher = Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a second approach to explaining the Moon's precession, Newton suggested that the perturbing influence of the [[Sun]] on the Moon's motion might be approximately equivalent to an additional linear force

:&lt;math&gt;
F(r) = \frac{A}{r^{2}} + B r
&lt;/math&gt;

The first term corresponds to the gravitational attraction between the Moon and the Earth, where ''r'' is the Moon's distance from the Earth. The second term, so Newton reasoned, might represent the average perturbing force of the Sun's gravity of the Earth-Moon system. Such a force law could also result if the Earth were surrounded by a spherical dust cloud of uniform density.&lt;ref name="symon_1971"&gt;{{cite book| author = Symon KR| year = 1971| title = Mechanics| edition = 3rd| publisher = Addison–Wesley| location = Reading, MA| isbn = 0-201-07392-7| pages = 267 (Chapter 6, problem 7)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using the formula for ''k'' for nearly circular orbits, and estimates of ''A'' and ''B'', Newton showed that this force law could not account for the Moon's precession, since the predicted apsidal angle ''α'' was (≈&amp;nbsp;180.76°)  rather than the observed α (≈&amp;nbsp;181.525°).  For every revolution, the long axis would rotate 1.5°,  roughly half of the observed 3.0°&lt;ref name="newton_45" /&gt;

==Generalization==
[[Isaac Newton]] first published his theorem in 1687, as Propositions 43–45 of Book I of his ''[[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]''. However, as astrophysicist [[Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar]] noted in his 1995 commentary on Newton's ''Principia'', the theorem remained largely unknown and undeveloped for over three centuries.&lt;ref name="Chandrasekhar, p. 183"/&gt;

The first generalization of Newton's theorem was discovered by Mahomed and Vawda in 2000.&lt;ref name="mahomed_2000" &gt;{{cite journal| author = Mahomed FM, Vawda F| year = 2000| title = Application of Symmetries to Central Force Problems| journal = [[Nonlinear Dynamics (journal)|Nonlinear Dynamics]] | volume = 21| issue = 4| pages = 307–315| doi = 10.1023/A:1008317327402}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Newton did, they assumed that the angular motion of the second particle was ''k'' times faster than that of the first particle, {{nowrap|''θ''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} ''k'' ''θ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}. In contrast to Newton, however, Mahomed and Vawda did not require that the radial motion of the two particles be the same, {{nowrap|''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} ''r''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}. Rather, they required that the inverse radii be related by a linear equation

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{1}{r_{2}(t)} = \frac{a}{r_{1}(t)} + b
&lt;/math&gt;

This transformation of the variables changes the path of the particle. If the path of the first particle is written {{nowrap|''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} ''g''(θ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)}}, the second particle's path can be written as

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{a r_2}{1 - b r_2} = g\left( \frac{\theta_2}{k} \right)
&lt;/math&gt;

If the motion of the first particle is produced by a central force ''F''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''r''), Mahomed and Vawda showed that the motion of the second particle can be produced by the following force

:&lt;math&gt;
F_2(r_2) = \frac{a^3}{\left( 1 - b r_2 \right)^2} F_{1}\left( \frac{a r_2}{1 - b r_2} \right) +
\frac{L^2}{mr^3} \left( 1 - k^2 \right) - \frac{bL^2}{mr^2}
&lt;/math&gt;

According to this equation, the second force ''F''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''r'') is obtained by scaling the first force and changing its argument, as well as by adding inverse-square and inverse-cube central forces.

For comparison, Newton's theorem of revolving orbits corresponds to the case {{nowrap|''a'' {{=}} 1}} and {{nowrap|''b'' {{=}} 0}}, so that {{nowrap|''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} ''r''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}. In this case, the original force is not scaled, and its argument is unchanged; the inverse-cube force is added, but the inverse-square term is not. Also, the path of the second particle is {{nowrap|''r''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} ''g''(θ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/''k'')}}, consistent with the formula given above.

==Derivations==

===Newton's derivation===
Newton's derivation is found in Section IX of his ''[[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia]]'', specifically Propositions 43–45.&lt;ref name="newton_derivation"&gt;Chandrasekhar, pp. 183–192.&lt;/ref&gt; His derivations of these Propositions are based largely on geometry.

; Proposition 43; Problem 30

[[File:Newton revolving orbit diagram.svg|thumb|right|250px|Diagram illustrating Newton's derivation. The blue planet follows the dashed elliptical orbit, whereas the green planet follows the solid elliptical orbit; the two ellipses share a common [[focus (geometry)|focus]] at the point '''C'''. The angles UCP and VCQ both equal ''θ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, whereas the black arc represents the angle UCQ, which equals {{nowrap|''θ''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} ''k'' ''θ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}. The solid ellipse has rotated relative to the dashed ellipse by the angle UCV, which equals (''k''&amp;minus;1)&amp;nbsp;''θ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. All three planets (red, blue and green) are at the same distance ''r'' from the center of force '''C'''.]]

:''It is required to make a body move in a curve that revolves about the center of force in the same manner as another body in the same curve at rest.''&lt;ref name="Chandrasekhar, p. 184"&gt;Chandrasekhar, p. 184.&lt;/ref&gt;

Newton's derivation of Proposition 43 depends on his Proposition 2, derived earlier in the ''Principia''.&lt;ref name="areal_law"&gt;Chandrasekhar, pp. 67–70.&lt;/ref&gt; Proposition 2 provides a geometrical test for whether the net force acting on a point mass (a particle) is a [[central force]]. Newton showed that a force is central if and only if the particle sweeps out equal areas in equal times as measured from the center.

Newton's derivation begins with a particle moving under an arbitrary central force ''F''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''r''); the motion of this particle under this force is described by its radius ''r''(''t'') from the center as a function of time, and also its angle θ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''t''). In an infinitesimal time ''dt'', the particle sweeps out an approximate right triangle whose area is

:&lt;math&gt;
dA_1 = \frac{1}{2} r^2 d\theta_1
&lt;/math&gt;

Since the force acting on the particle is assumed to be a central force, the particle sweeps out equal angles in equal times, by Newton's Proposition 2. Expressed another way, the ''rate'' of sweeping out area is constant

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{dA_1}{dt} = \frac{1}{2} r^2 \frac{d\theta_1}{dt} = \mathrm{constant}
&lt;/math&gt;

This constant ''areal velocity'' can be calculated as follows. At the [[apsis|apapsis and periapsis]], the positions of closest and furthest distance from the attracting center, the velocity and radius vectors are perpendicular; therefore, the [[angular momentum]] ''L&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' per mass ''m'' of the particle (written as ''h''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) can be related to the rate of sweeping out areas

:&lt;math&gt;
h_1 = \frac{L_1}{m} = r v_1 = r^2 \frac{d\theta_1}{dt} = 2 \frac{dA_1}{dt}
&lt;/math&gt;

Now consider a second particle whose orbit is identical in its radius, but whose angular variation is multiplied by a constant factor ''k''

:&lt;math&gt;
\theta_2(t) = k \theta_1(t)\,\!
&lt;/math&gt;

The areal velocity of the second particle equals that of the first particle multiplied by the same factor ''k''

:&lt;math&gt;
h_2 = 2 \frac{dA_2}{dt} = r^2 \frac{d\theta_2}{dt} =
k r^2 \frac{d\theta_1}{dt} = 2 k \frac{dA_1}{dt} = k h_1
&lt;/math&gt;

Since ''k'' is a constant, the second particle also sweeps out equal areas in equal times. Therefore, by Proposition 2, the second particle is also acted upon by a central force ''F''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''r''). This is the conclusion of Proposition 43.

; Proposition 44

:''The difference of the forces, by which two bodies may be made to move equally, one in a fixed, the other in the same orbit revolving, varies inversely as the cube of their common altitudes.''&lt;ref&gt;Chandrasekhar, p. 187.&lt;/ref&gt;

To find the magnitude of ''F''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''r'') from the original central force ''F''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''r''), Newton calculated their difference {{nowrap|''F''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''r'') − ''F''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''r'')}} using geometry and the definition of [[centripetal acceleration]]. In Proposition 44 of his ''Principia'', he showed that the difference is proportional to the inverse cube of the radius, specifically by the formula given above, which Newtons writes in terms of the two constant areal velocities, ''h''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''h''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
F_2(r) - F_1(r) = m \frac{h_1^2 - h_2^2}{r^3}
&lt;/math&gt;

; Proposition 45; Problem 31

:''To find the motion of the apsides in orbits approaching very near to circles.''&lt;ref name=Chandrasekhar192/&gt;

In this Proposition, Newton derives the consequences of his theorem of revolving orbits in the limit of nearly circular orbits. This approximation is generally valid for planetary orbits and the orbit of the Moon about the Earth. This approximation also allows Newton to consider a great variety of central force laws, not merely inverse-square and inverse-cube force laws.

===Modern derivation===
Modern derivations of Newton's theorem have been published by [[E. T. Whittaker|Whittaker]] (1937)&lt;ref&gt;Whittaker, p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar|Chandrasekhar]] (1995).&lt;ref name="Chandrasekhar, p. 184"/&gt; By assumption, the second angular speed is ''k'' times faster than the first

:&lt;math&gt;
\omega_{2} = \frac{d\theta_{2}}{dt} = k \frac{d\theta_{1}}{dt} = k \omega_{1}
&lt;/math&gt;

Since the two radii have the same behavior with time, ''r''(''t''), the conserved angular momenta are related by the same factor ''k''

:&lt;math&gt;
L_{2} = m r^{2} \omega_{2} = m r^{2} k \omega_{1} = k L_{1} \,\!
&lt;/math&gt;

The equation of motion for a radius ''r'' of a particle of mass ''m'' moving in a [[central force|central potential]] ''V''(''r'') is given by [[Euler–Lagrange equation|Lagrange's equations]]

:&lt;math&gt;
m\frac{d^2 r}{dt^2} - mr \omega^2 =
m\frac{d^2 r}{dt^2} - \frac{L^2}{mr^3} = F(r)
&lt;/math&gt;

Applying the general formula to the two orbits yields the equation

:&lt;math&gt;
m\frac{d^2 r}{dt^2} = F_1(r) + \frac{L_1^2}{mr^{3}} = F_2(r) + \frac{L_2^2}{mr^3} = F_2(r) + \frac{k^2 L_1^2}{mr^3}
&lt;/math&gt;

which can be re-arranged to the form

:&lt;math&gt;
F_{2}(r) = F_1(r) + \frac{L_1^2}{mr^3} \left( 1 - k^2 \right)
&lt;/math&gt;

This equation relating the two radial forces can be understood qualitatively as follows. The difference in angular speeds (or equivalently, in angular momenta) causes a difference in the [[centripetal force]] requirement; to offset this, the radial force must be altered with an inverse-cube force.

Newton's theorem can be expressed equivalently in terms of [[potential energy]], which is defined for central forces

:&lt;math&gt; F(r) = -\frac{dV}{dr} &lt;/math&gt;

The radial force equation can be written in terms of the two [[potential energy|potential energies]]

:&lt;math&gt;
- \frac{dV_2}{dr} = - \frac{dV_1}{dr} + \frac{L_1^2}{mr^3} \left( 1 - k^2 \right)
&lt;/math&gt;

Integrating with respect to the distance ''r'', Newtons's theorem states that a ''k''-fold change in angular speed results from adding an inverse-square potential energy to any given potential energy ''V''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''r'')

:&lt;math&gt;
V_2(r) = V_1(r) + \frac{L_1^2}{2mr^2} \left( 1 - k^2 \right)
&lt;/math&gt;

== Newton’s Geometric Proof from the Principia ==

[[File:Principia Revolving Orbits 2.jpg|Principia Revolving Orbits 2]]

=== Simplified Geometric Proof of Proposition 44 ===

Although Newton states that the problem was to be solved by Proposition 6, he does not use it explicitly. In the following, simplified proof, Proposition 6 is used to show how the result is derived.

Newton’s detailed proof follows that, and finally Proposition 6 is appended, as it is not well-known.

Proposition 44 uses Proposition 6 to prove a result about revolving orbits. In the propositions following Proposition 6 in Section 2 of the Principia, he applies it to specific curves, for example, conic sections. In the case of Proposition 44, it is applied to any orbit, under the action of an arbitrary force directed towards a fixed point, to produce a corresponding revolving orbit.

In Fig. 1. MN is part of that orbit. At point P, the body moves to Q under the action of a force directed towards S, as before. The force, F(SP) is defined at each point P on the curve.

In Fig.2, the corresponding part of the revolving orbit is mn with s as its centre of force. Assume that initially, the body in the static orbit starts out at right angles to the radius with speed V. The body in the revolving orbit must also start at right angles and assume its speed is v. In the case shown in Fig. 1., v &gt; V and the force is directed towards S. The argument applies equally if v &lt; V. Also, the force may be directed away from the centre.

Let SA be the initial direction of the static orbit, and sa, that of the revolving orbit. If after a certain time the bodies in the respective orbits are at P and p, then the ratio of the angles 
&lt;math&gt;
\frac{asp}{ASP} = \frac{psq}{PSQ} = \frac{v}{V }
&lt;/math&gt;
and similarly the areas
&lt;math&gt;
\frac{asp}{ASP} = \frac{psq}{PSQ} = \frac{v}{V }
&lt;/math&gt;, and the radii:
&lt;math&gt; SP = sp &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; SQ = sq &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; SA = sa &lt;/math&gt;

The figure pryx and the arc py in Fig. 2 is the figure PRQT and the arc PQ in Fig. 1, expanded linearly in the horizontal direction in the ratio v / V, so that

&lt;math&gt;
PU = pu
&lt;/math&gt;,
&lt;math&gt;
UT = ux 
&lt;/math&gt;, and 
&lt;math&gt;
qt = \frac{ v.QT }{V}
&lt;/math&gt;. The straight lines qt and QT should really be circular arcs with centres s and S and radii sq and SQ respectively. In the limit, their ratio becomes &lt;math&gt; \frac{v}{V}&lt;/math&gt;, whether they are straight lines or arcs.

Since in the limit the forces are parallel to SP and sp, if the same force acted on the body in Fig. 2 as in Fig. 1, the body would arrive at y, since ry = RQ. The difference in horizontal speed does not affect the vertical distances. Newton refers to Corollary 2 of the Laws of Motion where the motion of the bodies is resolved into a component in the radial direction acted on by the whole force, and the other component transverse to it, acted on by no force.

However, the distance from y to the centre, s is now greater than SQ, so an additional force is required to move the body to q such that sq = SQ. The extra force is represented by yq, and f is proportional to ry + yq, just as F is to RQ.

&lt;math&gt;
RQ = SP - PU - ST 
&lt;/math&gt;, 
&lt;math&gt;
rq = sp - pu - st = RQ + ST - st
&lt;/math&gt;

The difference, 
&lt;math&gt;
ST - st = yq
&lt;/math&gt;
can be found as follows:

&lt;math&gt;
ST^2 = SQ^2 - QT^2
&lt;/math&gt;,
&lt;math&gt;
st^2 = sq^2 - qt^2
&lt;/math&gt;, so 
&lt;math&gt;
(ST - st)(ST + st) = qt^2 - QT^2
&lt;/math&gt;

And in the limit, as QT and qt approach zero, ST + st becomes equal to SQ + sq or 2SP so

&lt;math&gt;
yq.2SP = \frac{QT^2(v^2 - V^2)}{V^2}
&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore,
&lt;math&gt;
rq = RQ + ST - st = RQ + \frac{QT^2(v^2 - V^2) }{2SP.V^2}
&lt;/math&gt;

Since from Proposition 6 (Fig.1 and see below), the force
&lt;math&gt;
= \frac{k.QR}{(SP^2.QT^2) }
&lt;/math&gt;
Dividing by 
&lt;math&gt;
\frac {(SP^2.QT^2)}{k}
&lt;/math&gt;,
where k is constant. to obtain the forces
&lt;math&gt;
f(sp) = F(sp) + \frac{k(v^2 - V^2) }{2sp^3.V^2}
&lt;/math&gt;

In Fig. 3 at the initial point A of the static curve, draw the tangent AR, which is perpendicular to SA and the circle AQD which just touches the curve at A. Let ρ be the radius of that circle. Since angle SAR is a right-angle, the centre of the circle lies on SA. From the property of a circle:

&lt;math&gt;
QT^2 = AT.(2\rho - AT) = RQ.(2\rho - RQ)
&lt;/math&gt;
and in the limit as Q approaches A, this becomes:
&lt;math&gt;
\rho =  QT^2 / 2RQ
&lt;/math&gt;

Hence 
&lt;math&gt;
F(SA) = \frac{k}{(2\rho.SA^2) }
&lt;/math&gt;

And since F(SA) is given, this determines the constant k. However, Newton wants the force at A, to be of the form c.V&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; / SA&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; where c is a constant so that
&lt;math&gt;
f(sp) = F(sp) + \frac{c\rho (v^2 - V^2) }{sp^3}
&lt;/math&gt;
Where
&lt;math&gt;
c = \frac{F(SA). SA^2}{V^2}
&lt;/math&gt;

The expression for f(sp) above is the same as Newton’s in Corollary 4 of Proposition 44, except that he uses different letters. He writes &lt;math&gt; \frac{G}{F} = \frac{v}{V} &lt;/math&gt; (where G and F are not necessarily equal to v and V respectively), and uses the letter “V” for the constant corresponding to “c”, and the letter “X” for the function F(sp).
	
The above geometric proof shows very clearly where the additional force arises from to make the orbit revolve with respect to the static orbit.

=== Newton’s Proof of Proposition 44 ===

Newton’s proof is complicated, in view of the simplicity of the above proof. As an example, his proof requires some deciphering, as the following sentence shows:

“And therefore, if with centre C and any radius CP or Cp a circular sector is described equal to the total area VPC which the body P revolving in an immobile orbit has described in any time by a radius drawn to the centre, the difference between the forces by which the body P in an immobile orbit and body p in a mobile orbit revolve will be to the centripetal force by which some body, by a radius drawn to the centre, would have been able to describe that sector uniformly in the same time in which the area VPC was described as G&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; - F&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; to F&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.”

He initially regards the infinitesimal &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; as fixed, then the areas SPQ and spq are proportional to V and v, respectively and therefore:
&lt;math&gt;QT.SP \propto V\tau&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;qt.sp \propto v\tau&lt;/math&gt; at each of the points, P and p and:

&lt;math&gt;yq = \frac{qt^2 - QT^2}{2sp} \propto \frac{1}{sp^3}&lt;/math&gt; so the additional force varies inversely as the cube of the radius.

In Fig.1, XQ is a circular arc, with centre S and radius SQ, meeting SP at X. The perpendicular XY meets RQ at Y, and &lt;math&gt;YQ = \frac{QT^2}{2SP}&lt;/math&gt;.

Let &lt;math&gt;\phi(SQ)&lt;/math&gt; be the force required to make a body move in a circle of radius SQ, if it has the same speed as the transverse speed of the body in the static orbit at Q.

&lt;math&gt;\frac{f(sp) - F(sp)}{\phi(sp)} = \frac{yq}{YQ} = \frac{(qt^2 - QT^2) }{QT^2} = \frac{(v^2 - V^2) }{V^2}&lt;/math&gt;

at every point, P and in particular at the apside, A:

&lt;math&gt;\frac{f(SA) - F(SA)}{\phi(SA)} = \frac{(v^2 - V^2) }{V^2}&lt;/math&gt;

But at A, Fig. 3., the ratio of the force that makes the body follow the static curve, AE, to that required to make it follow the circle, AB, with radius SA, is inversely as the ratio of their radii of curvature, since they are both moving at the same speed, V, perpendicular to SA:

&lt;math&gt;\frac{F(SA)}{\phi(SA)} = \frac{SA}{\rho}&lt;/math&gt;, 
From the first part of the proof, &lt;math&gt; f(sp) - F(sp) = \frac{(f(sa) - F(sa))sa^3}{sp^3} = \frac{\rho.F(sa)sa^2.(v^2 - V^2)}{ V^2sp^3}&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting Newton’s expression for F(SA), gives the result obtained previously.

=== Newton’s Proof of Proposition 45 ===

“To find the motion of the apsides in orbits approaching circles.”

Proposition 44 was devised expressly to prove this Proposition. Newton wants to investigate the motion of a body in a nearly circular orbit attracted by a force of the form:
&lt;math&gt;
f(sp) = \gamma.sp^{n - 3}
&lt;/math&gt;

He approximates the static curve by an ellipse with an inverse square force, F(SP) directed to one of the foci, made to revolve by the addition of an inverse cube force, according to Proposition 44.

For the static ellipse, with the force varying inversely as SP squared: 
&lt;math&gt;
F(SP) = \frac{cV^2}{SP^2} 
&lt;/math&gt;, 
since c is defined above so that 
&lt;math&gt;
F(SA) = \frac{cV^2}{SA^2}
&lt;/math&gt;

With the body in the static orbit starting from the upper apside at A, it will reach the lower apside, the point closest to S, after moving through an angle of 180degs. Newton wants a corresponding revolving orbit starting from apside, a, about a point s, with the lower apside shifted by an angle, α, where &lt;math&gt; \frac{(180 + \alpha)}{180} = \frac{v}{V} &lt;/math&gt;

The initial speed, V, at A must be just less than that required to make the body move in a circle. Then ρ can be taken as equal to SA or sa. The problem is to determine v from the value of n, so that α can be found, or given α, to find n.

&lt;math&gt;
f(sp) = F(sp) + \frac{c\rho (v^2 - V^2)}{sp^3} =  \frac{c(spV^2 + sa(v^2 - V^2))}{sp^3}
&lt;/math&gt;

Letting &lt;math&gt; sp = sa - X &lt;/math&gt;,

&lt;math&gt;
f(sp) = \frac{c(sav^2 - XV^2)}{sp^3} 
&lt;/math&gt;

Then “by our method of converging series”:
&lt;math&gt;
f(sp) = \frac{\gamma.sp^n}{sp^3} = \frac{\gamma(sa - X)^n}{sp^3} = \frac{\gamma.sa^{n - 1}(sa - nX)}{sp^3}
&lt;/math&gt; plus terms in X&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and above which can be ignored because the orbit is almost circular, so X is small compared to sa.

Comparing the 2 expressions for f(sp): &lt;math&gt;
f(sp) = \frac{\gamma.sa^{n-1}(sa - nX)}{sp^3} = \frac{c(sav^2 - XV^2)}{sp^3}
&lt;/math&gt;
it follows that:
&lt;math&gt;
\frac{v}{V} = \frac {1}{n ^{1/2}} = \frac{(180 + \alpha)}{180}
&lt;/math&gt;

Also, 
&lt;math&gt;
f(sp) = \frac{c.v^2sp^{n-3}}{sa^{n-1}} 
&lt;/math&gt;

The ratio of the initial forces at a is given by:
&lt;math&gt; \frac{f(sa)}{F(sa)} = \frac{1}{n} &lt;/math&gt;

=== Proposition 6 for Proof of Proposition 44, above ===

In Fig. 1, a body is moving along a specific curve MN acted on by a (centripetal) force, towards the fixed point S. The force depends only of the distance of the point from S. The aim of this proposition is to determine how the force varies with the radius, SP. The method applies equally to the case where the force is centrifugal.

In a small time, &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;, the body moves from P to the nearby point Q. Draw QR parallel to SP meeting the tangent at R, and QT perpendicular to SP meeting it at T.

If there was no force present it would have moved along the tangent at P with the speed that it had at 
P, arriving at the point, R. If the force on the body moving from P to Q was constant in magnitude and parallel to the direction SP, the arc PQ would be parabolic with PR as its tangent and QR would be proportional to that constant force and the square of the time, &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;.

Conversely, if instead of arriving at R, the body was deflected to Q, then a constant force parallel to SP, with magnitude:
&lt;math&gt;
F \propto \frac{QR}{\tau^2}
&lt;/math&gt;  would have caused it to reach Q instead of R.

However, since the direction of the radius from S to points on the arc PQ and also the magnitude of the force towards S will change along PQ, the above relation will not give the exact force at P. If Q is sufficiently close to P, the direction of force will be almost parallel to SP all along PQ and if the force changes little, PQ can be assumed to be approximated by a parabolic arc with the force given as above in terms of QR and &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;.

The time, &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; is proportional to the area of the sector SPQ. This is Kepler’s Second Law. A proof is demonstrated in Proposition 1, Book 1 in the Principia. Since the arc PQ can be approximated by a straight line, the area of the sector SPQ and the area of the triangle SPQ can be taken as equal so:

&lt;math&gt;
F \propto \frac{QR}{\tau^2} = \frac{k.QR}{(SP^2.QT^2) }
&lt;/math&gt;, where k is constant.

Again, this is not exact for finite lengths PQ. The force law is obtained if the limit of the above expression exists as a function of SP, as PQ approaches zero.

In fact, in time &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;, the body with no force would have reached a point, W, further from P than R. However, in the limit QW becomes parallel to SP. The point W is ignored in Newton’s proof.

Also, Newton describes QR as the versed sine of the arc with P at its centre and length twice QP. Although this is not strictly the same as the QR that he has in the diagram (Fig.1), in the limit, they become equal.

Notes:

This proposition is based on Galileo’s analysis of a body following a parabolic trajectory under the action of a constant acceleration. In Proposition 10, he describes it as Galileo’s Theorem, and mentions Galileo several other times in relation to it in the Principia. Combining it with Kepler's Second Law gives the simple and elegant method.

In the historically very important case where MN in Fig. 1 was part of an ellipse and S was one of its foci, Newton showed in Proposition 11 that the limit QR / QT&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; was constant at each point on the curve so that the force on the body directed towards the fixed point S varied inversely as the square of the distance SP.

Besides the ellipse with the centre at the focus, Newton also applied Proposition 6 to the hyperbola (Proposition 12), and the parabola (Proposition 13). Also, to the ellipse with the centre of force at the centre of the ellipse (Proposition 10), to the equiangular spiral (Proposition 9), and to the circle, with the centre of force not coinciding with the centre, and even on the circumference (Proposition 7).

A '''pedigree chart''' is  a diagram that shows the occurrence and appearance or [[phenotype]]s of a particular gene or [[organism]] and its [[ancestor]]s from one generation to the next,&lt;ref&gt;[http://genealogy.about.com/library/glossary/bldef-pedigreechart.htm pedigree chart] Genealogy Glossary - About.com, a part of The New York Times Company.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.familysearch.org/eng/helps/Search/Ancestors/afpedigree.htm|title=HELP - Ancestral File - Pedigree Chart|author=|date=|website=familysearch.org|accessdate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://geneasearch.com/tips/1025.htm Documenting Your Pedigree Chart] By Melody Daisson -  GeneaSearch.com&lt;/ref&gt; most commonly [[humans]], show [[dog]]s,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.akc.org/reg/pedigree_overview.cfm&lt;/ref&gt; and race [[horse]]s.

The word pedigree is a corruption of the Anglo-Norman French ''pé de grue'' or "crane's foot", either because the typical lines and split lines (each split leading to different offspring of the one parent line) resemble the thin leg and foot of a [[Crane (bird)|crane]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/pedigree|"pedigree"] at Merriam-Webster online&lt;/ref&gt; or because such a mark was used to denote succession in pedigree charts&lt;ref&gt;[https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/pedigree|"pedigree"] at Oxford Dictionaries online&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Properties==

A pedigree results in the presentation of family information in the form of an easily readable chart. Pedigrees use a standardized set of symbols, squares represent males and circles represent females. Pedigree construction is a family history, and details about an earlier generation may be uncertain as memories fade. If the sex of the person is unknown a diamond is used. Someone with the phenotype in question is represented by a filled-in (darker) symbol. [[Heterozygotes]], when identifiable, are indicated by a shade dot inside a symbol or a half-filled symbol.

Relationships in a pedigree are shown as a series of lines. Parents are connected by a horizontal line and a vertical line leads to their offspring. The offspring are connected by a horizontal sibship line and listed in birth order from left to right. If the offspring are twins then they will be connected by a triangle. If an offspring dies then its symbol will be crossed by a line. If the offspring is still born or aborted it is represented by a small triangle.

Each generation is identified by a [[Roman numerals|Roman numeral]] (I, II, III, and so on), and each individual within the same generation is identified by an [[Arabic numerals|Arabic numeral]] (1, 2, 3, and so on). Analysis of the pedigree using the principles of [[Mendelian inheritance]] can determine whether a trait has a dominant or recessive pattern of inheritance. Pedigrees are often constructed after a family member afflicted with a genetic disorder has been identified. This individual, known as the [[proband]], is indicated on the pedigree by an arrow.&lt;ref&gt;Michael R. Cummings "Human Heredity Principles and issues" pg 59-60&lt;/ref&gt; These changes may occur yearly or monthly. 

==In human use==
[[File:Sex-Linked Recessive Pedigree.svg|thumb|This pedigree has a sex-linked recessive disorder. It is possible to tell the trait is recessive because it skips a generation with only carriers in generation 2. Because the trait is sex-linked only females can be carriers since only females have 2 x chromosomes. As a result a lot more males tend to display sex-linked recessive disorder than females. Female carriers tend to give the trait to about half of their sons and daughters but only the sons will be affected while the daughters will only be carriers.]]

[[File:Sex-Linked Dominant Pedigree.svg|thumb|This pedigree has a sex-linked dominant disorder. It is possible to tell it is dominant because it doesn't skip generations. It is possible to tell it is sex-linked because affected fathers will pass the trait on to all of their daughters. This is because they have to pass along their affected dominant x but none of their sons because they pass on a y to their sons. The affected mother in the second generation is heterozygous (having a dominant and a recessive allele) will have a 50% chance of passing the trait on to all of her children regardless of their gender.]]

[[File:Autosomal Dominant Pedigree.svg|thumb|This pedigree has an autosomal dominant disorder. It is possible to tell the trait is dominant because it never skips a generation and there are no unaffected carriers. Affected children must have affected parents. When one parent possesses the trait and is heterozygous ( possessing a dominant and recessive allele) approximately half of the children will possess the dominant disorder.]]

[[File:Autosomal Recessive Pedigree (1).svg|thumb|This pedigree has a autosomal recessive disorder. It is possible to tell this order is recessive because it skips generations with none of generation 3 actually displaying the trait. When both parents display the disorder all of their kids have to display the disorder. But when only one parent displays the disorder all of the kids will be carriers but unaffected by the trait. It is possible to tell the trait is autosomal because it affects females and males equally.]]

{{anchor|In human use}}In [[England]] and [[Wales]] pedigrees are officially recorded in the [[College of Arms]], which has records going back to the Middle Ages, including pedigrees collected during roving inquiries by its [[herald]]s during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. The purpose of these [[heraldic visitation]]s was to register and regulate the use of [[coats of arms]]. Those who claimed the right to bear arms had to provide proof either of a grant of arms to them by the College, or of descent from an ancestor entitled to arms. It was for this reason that pedigrees were recorded by the visitations. Pedigrees continue to be registered at the College of Arms and kept up to date on a voluntary basis but they are not accessible to the general public without payment of a fee.

More visible, therefore, are the pedigrees recorded in published works, such as [[Burke's Peerage]] and Burke's [[Landed gentry|Landed Gentry]] in the United Kingdom and, in continental [[Europe]] by the [[Almanach de Gotha]].

A pedigree may be used to establish the probability of a child having a particular disorder or condition. It may be used to discover where the genes in question are located (x, y, or autosome chromosome), and to determine whether a trait is dominant or recessive. When a pedigree shows a condition appearing in a 50:50 ratio between men and women it is considered [[Autosome|autosomal]]. When the condition predominantly affects males in the pedigree it is considered [[X-linked recessive inheritance|x-linked]].&lt;ref&gt;http://isite.lps.org/cbittle/web/documents/PedigreeCharts.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Some examples of dominant traits include: [[male baldness]], [[astigmatism]], and [[dwarfism]]. Some examples of recessive traits include: small eyes, little body hair, and tall stature.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sciencebrainwaves.com/blogs/biology/genetics/dominant-and-recessive-genes-in-humans/&lt;/ref&gt;

==In animal husbandry==
[[Image:Pedigree-sh-1895.jpg|thumb|Pedigree of horse Shagya IX b. 1895]]
In the practice of [[selective breeding]] of animals, particularly in [[animal fancy]] and [[livestock]], including [[horse]]s, pedigree charts are used to track the ancestry of animals and assist in the planning of suitable [[breeding programs]] to enhance desirable traits.  [[Breed registry|Breed registries]] are formed and are dedicated to the accurate tracking of pedigrees and maintaining accurate records of birth, death and identifying characteristics of each registered animal.&lt;ref&gt;http://research.vet.upenn.edu/pennhip/OwnerBreederInformation/SelectiveBreeding/tabid/3350/Default.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9164">'''Pinch analysis''' is a methodology for minimising energy consumption of [[process (engineering)|chemical processes]] by calculating thermodynamically feasible ''energy targets'' (or minimum energy consumption) and achieving them by optimising heat recovery systems, energy supply methods and process operating conditions. It is also known as ''[[process integration]]'', ''heat integration'', ''energy integration'' or ''pinch technology''.

The process data is represented as a set of energy flows, or streams, as a function of heat load (kW) against temperature (°C).  These data are combined for all the streams in the plant to give ''composite curves'', one for all ''hot streams'' (releasing heat) and one for all ''cold streams'' (requiring heat). The point of closest approach between the hot and cold composite curves is the ''[[pinch (plasma physics)|pinch]] point'' (or just ''pinch'') with a hot stream pinch temperature and a cold stream pinch temperature.  This is where the design is most constrained.  Hence, by finding this point and starting the design there, the [[thermal energy|energy]] targets can be achieved using [[heat exchangers]] to recover [[heat]] between hot and cold streams in two separate systems, one for temperatures above pinch temperatures and one for temperatures below pinch temperatures. In practice, during the pinch analysis of an existing design, often cross-pinch exchanges of heat are found between a hot stream with its temperature above the pinch and a cold stream below the pinch. Removal of those exchangers by alternative matching makes the process reach its ''energy target''.

== History ==

In 1971, Ed Hohmann stated in his PhD that 'one can
compute the least amount of hot and cold utilities required for a process
without knowing the heat exchanger network that could accomplish it. One
also can estimate the heat exchange area required'.

In late 1977, Ph.D. student [[Bodo Linnhoff]] under the supervision of Dr John Flower at the [[University of Leeds]]&lt;ref name="ebrahim"&gt;{{Cite journal| first1 = M. | last2 = Kawari | first2 = Al- | title = Pinch technology: an efficient tool for chemical-plant energy and capital-cost saving | journal = Applied Energy | volume = 65| last1 = Ebrahim | pages = 45–49| year = 2000 | doi = 10.1016/S0306-2619(99)00057-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  showed the existence in many processes of a heat integration bottleneck, ‘the pinch’, which laid the basis for the technique, known today as pinch-analysis. At that time he had joined [[Imperial Chemical Industries]] (ICI) where he led practical applications and further method development.

Bodo Linnhoff developed the 'Problem Table', an algorithm for calculating the energy targets and worked out the basis for a calculation of the surface area required, known as ‘the spaghetti network’. These algorithms enabled practical application of the technique.

In 1982 he joined University of Manchester Institute of Technology  ([[UMIST]], present day [[University of Manchester]]) to continue the work. In 1983 he set up a consultation firm known as [[Linnhoff March International]] later acquired by [[KBC Energy Services]].

Many refinements have been developed since and used in a wide range of industries, including extension to heat and power systems and
non-process situations. Both detailed and simplified (spreadsheet) programs are now available to calculate the energy targets. See Pinch Analysis Software below.

In recent years, Pinch analysis has been extended beyond energy applications. It now includes:

* Mass Exchange Networks (El-Halwagi and Manousiouthakis, 1987)
* [[Water pinch]] (Yaping Wang and Robin Smith, 1994; Nick Hallale, 2002; Prakash and Shenoy, 2005)
* [[Hydrogen pinch]] (Nick Hallale et al., 2003; Agrawal and Shenoy, 2006)

== Weaknesses ==

Classical pinch-analysis primarily calculates the energy costs for the heating and cooling utility. At the pinch point, where the hot and cold streams are the most constrained, large heat exchangers are required to transfer heat between the hot and cold streams. Large heat exchangers entail high investment costs. In order to reduce capital cost, in practice a minimum temperature difference (Δ T) at the pinch point is demanded, e.g., 10&amp;nbsp;°F.  It is possible to estimate the heat exchanger area and capital cost, and hence the optimal Δ T minimum value. However, the cost curve is quite flat and the optimum may be affected by "topology traps". The pinch method is not always appropriate for simple networks or where severe operating constraints exist.  Kemp (2006) discusses these aspects in detail.

== Recent Developments&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = A Critical Review and Annotated Bibliography for Heat Exchanger Network Synthesis in the 20th Century|url = http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ie010389e|journal = Industrial &amp; Engineering Chemistry Research|date = 2002-03-09|pages = 2335–2370|volume = 41|issue = 10|doi = 10.1021/ie010389e|language = en|first = Kevin C.|last = Furman|first2 = Nikolaos V.|last2 = Sahinidis}}&lt;/ref&gt; ==

The problem of integrating heat between hot and cold streams, and finding the optimal network, in particular in terms of costs, may today be solved with numerical [[algorithm]]s. The network can be formulated as a so-called [[Mixed integer programming|mixed integer]] non-linear programming (MINLP) problem and solved with an appropriate numerical [[solver]]. Nevertheless, large-scale MINLP problems can still be hard to solve for today’s numerical algorithms. Alternatively, some attempts were made to formulate the MINLP problems to mixed integer linear problems, where then possible networks are screened and optimized.  For simple networks of a few streams and heat exchangers, hand design methods with simple targeting software are often adequate, and aid the engineer in understanding the process.

In [[type theory]], a '''polynomial functor''' (or '''container functor''') is a kind of [[endofunctor]] of a [[Category (mathematics)|category]] of types that is intimately related to the concept of [[Inductive type|inductive]] and [[Coinduction|coinductive]] types. Specifically, all [[W type|W-types]] (resp. M-types) are (isomorphic to) [[initial algebra]]s (resp. [[final coalgebra]]s) of such functors.

Polynomial functors have been studied in the more general setting of a [[Topos|pretopos]] with Σ-types,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moerdijk|first=Ieke|last2=Palmgren|first2=Erik|title=Wellfounded trees in categories|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/S0168-0072(00)00012-9|journal=Annals of Pure and Applied Logic|volume=104|issue=1–3|pages=189–218|doi=10.1016/s0168-0072(00)00012-9|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; this article deals only with the applications of this concept inside the category of types of a [[Intuitionistic type theory|Martin-Löf style type theory]].

== Definition ==

Let {{var|U}} be a [[Universe (mathematics)|universe]] of types, let {{var|A}} : {{var|U}}, and let {{var|B}} : {{var|A}} → {{var|U}} be a family of types indexed by {{var|A}}. The pair ({{var|A}}, {{var|B}}) is sometimes called a '''signature'''{{sfn|Ahrens|loc=Definition 1}} or a '''container'''.{{sfn|Abbot|p=4}} The '''polynomial functor''' associated to the container ({{var|A}}, {{var|B}}) is defined as follows:{{sfn|Univalent Foundations Program|2013|loc=Equation 5.4.6}}{{sfn|Ahrens|loc=Definition 2}}{{sfn|Awodey|2012|p=8}}
:&lt;math display="block"&gt;
\begin{align}
  P : U &amp;\longrightarrow U \\
  X &amp;\longmapsto \sum_{a:A} (B(a) \to X)
\end{align}.
&lt;/math&gt;
Any functor naturally isomorphic to {{var|P}} is called a  '''container functor'''.{{sfn|Abbot|p=10}} The action of {{var|P}} on functions is defined by 
:&lt;math display="block"&gt;
\begin{align}
  P^* : (X\to Y) &amp;\longrightarrow (P^*X\to P^*Y) \\
  (f, (a,g)) &amp;\longmapsto (a,g\circ f)
\end{align}.
&lt;/math&gt;
Note that this assignment is not only truly functorial in extensional type theories (see [[#Properties]]).

== Properties ==

In intensional type theories, such functions are not truly functors, because the universe type is not strictly a category (the field of [[homotopy type theory]] is dedicated to exploring how the universe type behaves more like a [[Higher category theory|higher category]]). However, it is functorial up to propositional equalities, that is, the following identity types are inhabited:
:&lt;math display="block"&gt;
\begin{align}
  P^*(f\circ g) &amp;= P^*f\circ P^*g \\
  P^*(\mathsf{id}_X) &amp;= \mathsf{id}_{PX}
\end{align}.
&lt;/math&gt;
for any functions {{var|f}} and {{var|g}} and any type {{var|X}}, where &lt;math&gt;\mathsf{id}_X&lt;/math&gt; is the [[identity function]] on the type {{var|X}}.{{sfn|Awodey|2015}}

The '''principle of nonvacuous contrast''' is a logical or methodological principle which requires that a genuine predicate never refer to everything, or to nothing, within its [[universe of discourse]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12555">'''Quantitative storytelling''' ('''QST''') is a systematic approach to explore the multiplicity of frames potentially legitimate in a scientific study or controversy.&lt;ref name="QST1"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.futures.2016.11.012 |title=What is wrong with evidence based policy, and how can it be improved? |journal=Futures |volume=91 |pages=62–71 |year=2017 |last1=Saltelli |first1=Andrea |last2=Giampietro |first2=Mario }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Giampietro2014"&gt;[Giampietro, M., Aspinall, R. J., Ramos-Martin, J. and Bukkens, S. G. F. (2014) Resource Accounting for Sustainability Assessment: The Nexus between Energy, Food, Water and Land Use. Taylor &amp; Francis (Routledge Explorations in Sustainability and Governance).](https://books.google.es/books?id=Vb6uAwAAQBAJ)&lt;/ref&gt; QST assumes that in an interconnected society more frameworks and worldviews are legitimately upheld by different constituencies and social actors. QST looks critically to models used in evidence-based policy (EBP). These are often in the form of risk analyses or cost benefit analyses, and necessarily focus on a single framing of the issue under consideration. QST suggest corrective approaches to this practice.  

==Context==
Quantitative storytelling (QST) addresses evidence based policy and can be considered as a reaction to a style of quantification based on cost benefir or risk analysis which - in the opinion of QST proponents - may contain important implicit normative assumptions.&lt;ref name="QST1" /&gt;

In the logic of QST, a single quantification corresponding to a single view of what the problem is runs the risk of distracting from what could be alternative readings.&lt;ref name="QST1" /&gt;

Alternative frames (Ravetz, 1987&lt;ref name="Ravetz1997"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/107554708700900104 |title=Usable Knowledge, Usable Ignorance |journal=Knowledge |volume=9 |pages=87–116 |year=2016 |last1=Ravetz |first1=Jerome R }}&lt;/ref&gt; ; Rayner, 2012&lt;ref name="Rayner2012"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/03085147.2011.637335 |title=Uncomfortable knowledge: The social construction of ignorance in science and environmental policy discourses |journal=Economy and Society |volume=41 |pages=107–25 |year=2012 |last1=Rayner |first1=Steve }}&lt;/ref&gt;) may represent ‘uncomfortable knowledge’, which is removed from the policy discourse. Thus, extensive mathematical modelling in EBP to support a given policy may lead to a simplification of the available perceptions and generate - rather than resolve – controversies. The word ‘hypo-cognition’ has been used in the context of these instrumental use of frames (Lakoff et al., 2008&lt;ref name="Lakoff2008"&gt;[Lakoff, G., Dean, H. and Hazen, D. (2008) Don’t Think of an Elephant!: Know Your Values and Frame the Debate. Chelsea Green Publishing.](https://books.google.es/books?id=zbJ1oxHC9a0C)
&lt;/ref&gt;; Lakoff, 2010&lt;ref name="Lakoff2010"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/17524030903529749 |title=Why it Matters How We Frame the Environment |journal=Environmental Communication |volume=4 |pages=70–81 |year=2010 |last1=Lakoff |first1=George }}&lt;/ref&gt;). 

Under this critical viewpoint, mathematical models can be seen as a tool for ‘displacement’. Displacement occurs where a model becomes the end instead of the tool, e.g. when an institution chooses to monitor and manage the outcome of a model rather than what happens in reality&lt;ref name="Rayner2012" /&gt;. Once exposed, the strategic use of hypo-cognition erodes the trust in the involved actors and institutions.&lt;ref name="Rayner2012" /&gt;

==Approach==
QST suggests acknowledging ignorance, as to work out ‘clumsy solutions’ (Rayner, 2012&lt;ref name="Rayner2012" /&gt;), which may accommodate unshared epistemological or ethical principles. This is in turn close to the [[Post-normal science|PNS]] suggested style of inquiry known as ‘working deliberatively within imperfections’ (van der Sluijs and Petersen, 2008&lt;ref name="Sluijs2012"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1088/1748-9326/3/2/024008 |title=Exploring the quality of evidence for complex and contested policy decisions |journal=Environmental Research Letters |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=024008 |year=2008 |last1=Van Der Sluijs |first1=Jeroen P |last2=Petersen |first2=Arthur C |last3=Janssen |first3=Peter H M |last4=Risbey |first4=James S |last5=Ravetz |first5=Jerome R }}&lt;/ref&gt;), and to the exigence for a ‘rediscovery of ignorance’ (see preface to Pereira and Funtowicz, 2015&lt;ref name="Pereira2012"&gt;[Pereira, A. G. and Funtowicz, S. (2015) Science, Philosophy and Sustainability : the End of the Cartesian dream.{{pn|date=April 2018}}](https://www.crcpress.com/Science-Philosophy-and-Sustainability-The-End-of-the-Cartesian-dream/Pereira-Funtowicz/p/book/9781138796409)&lt;/ref&gt;).
QST also calls attention to the power relationships at play in the use of evidence. Saltelli and Giampietro (2017)&lt;ref name="QST1" /&gt; suggest that our present approach to evidence-based policy, even in the more nuanced formulation of evidence-informed policy (Gluckman, 2014&lt;ref name="Gluckman2014"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/507163a |pmid=24627919 |title=Policy: The art of science advice to government |journal=Nature |volume=507 |issue=7491 |pages=163–5 |year=2014 |last1=Gluckman |first1=Peter }}&lt;/ref&gt;)– needs our urgent attention. Unavoidable asymmetries are generated by the fact that stronger players have access to better evidence, and can use it strategically (Boden and Epstein, 2006&lt;ref name="Boden2006"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/14767720600752619 |title=Managing the research imagination? Globalisation and research in higher education |journal=Globalisation, Societies and Education |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=223–36 |year=2006 |last1=Boden |first1=Rebecca |last2=Epstein |first2=Debbie }}&lt;/ref&gt;; Strassheim and Kettunen, 2014&lt;ref name="Strassheim2014"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1332/174426514X13990433991320 |title=When does evidence-based policy turn into policy-based evidence? Configurations, contexts and mechanisms |journal=Evidence &amp; Policy: A Journal of Research, Debate and Practice |volume=10 |issue=2 |pages=259–77 |year=2014 |last1=Strassheim |first1=Holger |last2=Kettunen |first2=Pekka }}&lt;/ref&gt;).  The decline of pollinators challenge (Insectageddon, Mombiot, 2017&lt;ref name="Monbiot2017"&gt;[Monbiot G., 2017. Insectageddon: farming is more catastrophic than climate breakdown, The Guardian, October 20, 2017]( https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/20/insectageddon-farming-catastrophe-climate-breakdown-insect-populations)&lt;/ref&gt;) show that interest groups have more scope to capture regulators than the average citizen ad consumer.

QST encourages an effort in the pre-analytic, pre-quantitative phase of the analysis to map a socially robust (i.e. inclusive of the interest of different stakeholders) universe of possible frames. QST expands on one of the rules [[sensitivity auditing]] by asking the question of ‘what to do’ in order to avoid that an issue is framed unilaterally. Obviously, the medicine for a diseased evidence-based policy is not a prejudice - or superstition-based policy, but a more democratic and dialogic access to the provision of evidence – even in terms of agenda setting. For this a new institutional setting is needed&lt;ref name="QST1" /&gt;. 

QST does not eschew the use quantitative tools altogether. It suggests instead to explore quantitatively multiple narratives, avoiding spurious accuracy and focusing on some salient features of the selected stories. Rather than attempting to amass evidence in support to a given reading or policy, or to optimise it with modelling, QST operates ‘via negativa’, i.e. it tries to test whether the said framing runs afoul of a quantitative or qualitative analytical check. Here QST borrows from system ecology and attempts to refute the frames if these violate constraints of (Giampietro et al., 2014&lt;ref name="Giampietro2014" /&gt;): 

# feasibility (can we afford a given policy in terms of external constraints, e.g. existing biophysical resources?), 
# viability (can we afford it in the context of our internal constraints, governance, socioeconomic and technological arrangements?), and 
# desirability (will the relevant constituency accept it?).

==Applications==
Perhaps the best application of the concept of QST is an old study of GMO-related perceptions (Marris, 2001&lt;ref name="Marris2001"&gt;[Marris, C. (2001) Final Report of the PABE research project funded by the Commission of European Communities.]( http://csec.lancs.ac.uk/archive/pabe/docs/pabe_finalreport.pdf)&lt;/ref&gt;) which has lost very little of its actuality since the ongoing GMO and pesticide debate. 
By direct interview and measurements of stakeholders’ expectation and worldviews, Marris and co-authors showed that the prevailing narrative of the reaction to GMO as a ‘food scare’ – i.e. as an issue of safety to consume GMO food – did not show up among the concerns raised by the interviewed citizens, which worried instead about who would benefit from these technologies, why were they introduced in the first place, and whether existing regulatory authorities would be up to the task of resisting regulatory capture from powerful industrial incumbents.

Other applications of approaches which can be referred to QST are to the analyses for the cost of climate change,&lt;ref name="Saltelli-d’Hombres2011"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2009.12.003 |title=Sensitivity analysis didn't help.

In [[electromagnetism]], [[electromagnetic waves]] in [[vacuum]] travel at the [[speed of light]] ''c'', according to [[Maxwell's Equations]]. The '''retarded time''' is the time when the field began to propagate from the point where it was emitted to an observer. The term "retarded" is used in this context (and the literature) in the sense of [[propagation delay]]s.

==Retarded and advanced times==
[[File:Universal charge distribution.svg|250px|right|thumb|Position vectors '''r''' and '''r&amp;prime;''' used in the calculation.]]

The calculation of the retarded time ''t&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;'' or ''t''&lt;big&gt;′&lt;/big&gt; is nothing more than a simple "[[speed|speed-distance-time]]" calculation for EM fields.

If the EM field is radiated at [[position vector]] '''r'''&lt;big&gt;′&lt;/big&gt; (within the source charge distribution), and an observer at position '''r''' measures the EM field at time ''t'', the time delay for the field to travel from the charge distribution to the observer is |'''r'''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;'''r'''&lt;big&gt;′&lt;/big&gt;|/''c'', so subtracting this delay from the observer's time ''t'' gives the time when the field ''actually began to propagate'' - the retarded time, ''t''&lt;big&gt;′&lt;/big&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Electromagnetism (2nd Edition), I.S. Grant, W.R. Phillips, Manchester Physics, John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2008, {{ISBN|978-0471-927129}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Introduction to Electrodynamics (3rd Edition), D.J. Griffiths, Pearson Education, Dorling Kindersley, 2007, {{ISBN|81-7758-293-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;t' = t - \frac{|\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}'|}{c}&lt;/math&gt;

which can be rearranged to

:&lt;math&gt;c = \frac{|\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}'|}{t - t'}&lt;/math&gt;

showing how the positions and times correspond to source and observer.

Another related concept is the '''advanced time''' ''t&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;'', which takes the same mathematical form as above, but with a “+” instead of a “−”:

:&lt;math&gt; t_a = t + \frac{|\mathbf r - \mathbf r'|}{ c}&lt;/math&gt;

and is so-called since this is the time the field will advance from the present time ''t''. Corresponding to retarded and advanced times are [[retarded and advanced potential]]s.&lt;ref&gt;McGraw Hill Encyclopaedia of Physics (2nd Edition), C.B. Parker, 1994, {{ISBN|0-07-051400-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Retarded position ==

The retarded position can be obtained from the current position of a particle by subtracting the distance that has travelled in the lapse from the retarded time to the current time.
For an inertial particle, this position can be obtained by solving this equation:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r'} = \mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r_c}+\frac{|\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r'}|}{c}\mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt;

Where '''r'''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the current position of the source charge distribution and '''v''' its velocity.

==Application==

Perhaps surprisingly - electromagnetic fields and forces acting on charges depend on their history, not their mutual separation.&lt;ref&gt;Classical Mechanics, T.W.B. Kibble, European Physics Series, McGraw-Hill (UK), 1973, {{ISBN|007-084018-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The calculation of the electromagnetic fields at a present time includes integrals of [[charge density]] ρ('''r'''', ''t&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;'') and [[current density]] '''J'''('''r'''', ''t&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;'') using the retarded times and source positions. The quantity is prominent in [[electrodynamics]], [[electromagnetic radiation]] theory, and in [[Wheeler–Feynman absorber theory]], since the history of the charge distribution affects the fields at later times.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10227">In [[mathematics]], a '''symmetric tensor''' is a [[tensor]] that is invariant under a [[permutation]] of its vector arguments:
:&lt;math&gt;T(v_1,v_2,\ldots,v_r) = T(v_{\sigma 1},v_{\sigma 2},\ldots,v_{\sigma r})&lt;/math&gt;
for every permutation ''&amp;sigma;'' of the symbols {{nowrap|{1, 2, ..., ''r''}.}}
Alternatively, a symmetric tensor of order ''r'' represented in coordinates as a quantity with ''r'' indices satisfies
:&lt;math&gt;T_{i_1i_2\cdots i_r} = T_{i_{\sigma 1}i_{\sigma 2}\cdots i_{\sigma r}}.&lt;/math&gt;

The space of symmetric tensors of order ''r'' on a finite-dimensional [[vector space]] is [[natural isomorphism|naturally isomorphic]] to the dual of the space of [[homogeneous polynomial]]s of degree ''r'' on ''V''.  Over [[field (mathematics)|fields]] of [[characteristic zero]], the [[graded vector space]] of all symmetric tensors can be naturally identified with the [[symmetric algebra]] on ''V''. A related concept is that of the [[antisymmetric tensor]] or [[alternating form]]. Symmetric tensors occur widely in [[engineering]], [[physics]] and [[mathematics]].

==Definition==
Let ''V'' be a vector space and
:&lt;math&gt;T\in V^{\otimes k}&lt;/math&gt;
a tensor of order ''k''.  Then ''T'' is a symmetric tensor if
:&lt;math&gt;\tau_\sigma T = T\,&lt;/math&gt;
for the [[Tensor product#Tensor powers and braiding|braiding maps]] associated to every permutation &amp;sigma; on the symbols {1,2,...,''k''} (or equivalently for every [[Transposition (mathematics)|transposition]] on these symbols).

Given a [[basis (linear algebra)|basis]] {''e''&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt;} of ''V'', any symmetric tensor ''T'' of rank ''k'' can be written as

:&lt;math&gt;T = \sum_{i_1,\ldots,i_k=1}^N T_{i_1i_2\cdots i_k} e^{i_1} \otimes e^{i_2}\otimes\cdots \otimes e^{i_k}&lt;/math&gt;

for some unique list of coefficients &lt;math&gt;T_{i_1i_2\cdots i_k}&lt;/math&gt; (the ''components'' of the tensor in the basis) that are symmetric on the indices.  That is to say

:&lt;math&gt;T_{i_{\sigma 1}i_{\sigma 2}\cdots i_{\sigma k}} = T_{i_1i_2\cdots i_k}&lt;/math&gt;

for every [[permutation]] &amp;sigma;.

The space of all symmetric tensors of order ''k'' defined on ''V'' is often denoted by ''S''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;(''V'') or Sym&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;(''V'').  It is itself a vector space, and if ''V'' has dimension ''N'' then  the dimension of Sym&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;(''V'') is the [[binomial coefficient]]

:&lt;math&gt;\dim\operatorname{Sym}^k(V) = {N + k - 1 \choose k}.&lt;/math&gt;

We then construct Sym(''V'') as the [[direct sum of vector spaces|direct sum]] of Sym&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;(''V'') for ''k'' = 0,1,2,…
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Sym}(V)= \bigoplus_{k=0}^\infty \operatorname{Sym}^k(V).&lt;/math&gt;

==Examples==
There are many examples of symmetric tensors. Some include, the [[metric tensor]], &lt;math&gt;g_{\mu\nu}&lt;/math&gt;, the [[Einstein tensor]], &lt;math&gt;G_{\mu\nu}&lt;/math&gt; and the [[Ricci tensor]], &lt;math&gt;R_{\mu\nu}&lt;/math&gt;.

Many [[material properties]] and [[field (physics)|fields]] used in physics and engineering can be represented as symmetric tensor fields; for example: [[stress (physics)|stress]], [[strain tensor|strain]], and [[anisotropic]] [[Electrical resistivity and conductivity|conductivity]]. Also, in [[diffusion MRI]] one often uses symmetric tensors to describe diffusion in the brain or other parts of the body.

Ellipsoids are examples of [[algebraic varieties]]; and so, for general rank,  symmetric tensors, in the guise of [[homogeneous polynomial]]s, are used to define [[projective varieties]], and are often studied as such.

==Symmetric part of a tensor==
Suppose &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is a vector space over a field of [[Characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]] 0.  If {{nowrap|''T'' &amp;isin; ''V''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;otimes;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;}} is a tensor of order &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;, then the symmetric part of &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is the symmetric tensor defined by
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Sym}\, T = \frac{1}{k!}\sum_{\sigma\in\mathfrak{S}_k} \tau_\sigma T,&lt;/math&gt;
the summation extending over the [[symmetric group]] on ''k'' symbols.  In terms of a basis, and employing the [[Einstein summation convention]], if
:&lt;math&gt;T = T_{i_1i_2\cdots i_k}e^{i_1}\otimes e^{i_2}\otimes\cdots \otimes e^{i_k},&lt;/math&gt;
then
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Sym}\, T = \frac{1}{k!}\sum_{\sigma\in \mathfrak{S}_k} T_{i_{\sigma 1}i_{\sigma 2}\cdots i_{\sigma k}} e^{i_1}\otimes e^{i_2}\otimes\cdots \otimes e^{i_k}.&lt;/math&gt;

The components of the tensor appearing on the right are often denoted by
:&lt;math&gt;T_{(i_1i_2\cdots i_k)} = \frac{1}{k!}\sum_{\sigma\in \mathfrak{S}_k} T_{i_{\sigma 1}i_{\sigma 2}\cdots i_{\sigma k}}&lt;/math&gt;

with parentheses () around the indices being symmetrized. Square brackets [] are used to indicate anti-symmetrization.

==Symmetric product==
If ''T'' is a simple tensor, given as a pure tensor product
:&lt;math&gt;T=v_1\otimes v_2\otimes\cdots \otimes v_r&lt;/math&gt;
then the symmetric part of ''T'' is the symmetric product of the factors:
:&lt;math&gt;v_1\odot v_2\odot\cdots\odot v_r := \frac{1}{r!}\sum_{\sigma\in\mathfrak{S}_r} v_{\sigma 1}\otimes v_{\sigma 2}\otimes\cdots\otimes v_{\sigma r}.&lt;/math&gt;

In general we can turn Sym(''V'') into an [[algebra]] by defining the commutative and associative product ⊙.&lt;ref name="Kostrikin1997"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given two tensors {{nowrap|''T''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;isin; Sym&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;(''V'')}} and {{nowrap|''T''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;isin; Sym&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;(''V'')}}, we use the symmetrization operator to define:
:&lt;math&gt;T_1\odot T_2 = \operatorname{Sym}(T_1\otimes T_2)\quad\left(\in\operatorname{Sym}^{k_1+k_2}(V)\right).&lt;/math&gt;
It can be verified (as is done by Kostrikin and Manin&lt;ref name="Kostrikin1997" /&gt;) that the resulting product is in fact commutative and associative. In some cases the operator is omitted: {{nowrap|1=''T''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''T''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = ''T''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ⊙ ''T''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}.

In some cases an exponential notation is used:
:&lt;math&gt;v^{\odot k} = \underbrace{v \odot v \odot \cdots \odot v}_{k\text{ times}}=\underbrace{v \otimes v \otimes \cdots \otimes v}_{k\text{ times}}=v^{\otimes k}.&lt;/math&gt;
Where ''v'' is a vector.
Again, in some cases the ⊙ is left out:
:&lt;math&gt;v^k=\underbrace{v\,v\,\cdots\,v}_{k\text{ times}}=\underbrace{v\odot v\odot\cdots\odot v}_{k\text{ times}}.&lt;/math&gt;

==Decomposition==
In analogy with the theory of [[symmetric matrix|symmetric matrices]], a (real) symmetric tensor of order 2 can be "diagonalized".  More precisely, for any tensor ''T''&amp;nbsp;&amp;isin;&amp;nbsp;Sym&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(''V''), there are an integer ''r'', non-zero unit vectors ''v''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''v''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;isin;&amp;nbsp;''V'' and weights ''&amp;lambda;''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''&amp;lambda;''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt; such that
:&lt;math&gt;T = \sum_{i=1}^r \lambda_i \, v_i\otimes v_i.&lt;/math&gt;
The minimum number ''r'' for which such a decomposition is possible is the (symmetric) rank of ''T''.  The vectors appearing in this minimal expression are the ''[[Principal axis theorem|principal axes]]'' of the tensor, and generally have an important physical meaning. For example, the principal axes of the [[inertia tensor]] define the [[Poinsot's ellipsoid]] representing the moment of inertia. Also see [[Sylvester's law of inertia]].

For symmetric tensors of arbitrary order ''k'', decompositions
:&lt;math&gt;T = \sum_{i=1}^r \lambda_i \, v_i^{\otimes k}&lt;/math&gt;
are also possible. The minimum number ''r'' for which such a decomposition is possible is the ''symmetric'' [[Tensor (intrinsic definition)#Tensor rank|rank]] of ''T''.&lt;ref name="Comon2008"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Comon | first1 = P. | last2 = Golub | first2 = G. | last3 = Lim | first3 = L.

For second-order tensors this corresponds to the rank of the matrix representing the tensor in any basis, and it is well known that the maximum rank is equal to the dimension of the underlying vector space. However, for higher orders this need not hold: the rank can be higher than the number of dimensions in the underlying vector space. Moreover, the rank and symmetric rank of a symmetric tensor may differ.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shitov|first=Yaroslav|date=2018|title=A Counterexample to Comon's Conjecture|url=https://epubs.siam.org/action/captchaChallenge?redirectUri=%2Fdoi%2F10.1137%2F17M1131970|journal=SIAM Journal on Applied Algebra and Geometry|language=en-US|volume=2|issue=3|pages=428–443|doi=10.1137/17m1131970|issn=2470-6566|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11870">The '''Triffin dilemma''' or '''Triffin paradox''' is the conflict of economic interests that arises between short-term domestic and long-term international objectives for countries whose currencies serve as global [[reserve currency|reserve currencies]]. This dilemma was identified in the 1960s by [[Belgium|Belgian]]-[[United States|American]] economist [[Robert Triffin]],&lt;ref&gt;While named for Triffin, "French economist [[Jacques Rueff]] described the fatal weakness of foreign-exchange reserves in a 1932 lecture." John D. Mueller, Wall Street Journal, October 8, 2018, page A19.&lt;/ref&gt; who pointed out that the country whose currency, being the global reserve currency, foreign nations wish to hold, must be willing to supply the world with an extra supply of its currency to fulfill world demand for these [[foreign exchange reserves]], thus leading to a trade deficit.

The use of a national currency, such as the [[United States dollar|U.S. dollar]], as global reserve currency leads to tension between its national and global monetary policy. This is reflected in fundamental imbalances in the [[balance of payments]], specifically the [[current account]], as some goals require an outflow of dollars from the United States, while others require an overall inflow.

Specifically, the Triffin dilemma is usually cited to articulate the problems with the role of the U.S. dollar as the reserve currency under the [[Bretton Woods system]]. [[John Maynard Keynes]] had anticipated this difficulty and had advocated the use of a global reserve currency called '[[Bancor]]'. Currently the [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]]'s [[Special drawing rights|SDR]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s are the closest thing to the proposed Bancor but they have not been adopted widely enough to replace the dollar as the global reserve currency.

In the wake of the [[financial crisis of 2007–2008]], the governor of the [[People's Bank of China]] explicitly named the reserve currency status of the US dollar as a contributing factor to global savings and investment imbalances that led to the crisis. As such the Triffin Dilemma is related to the [[Global saving glut|Global Savings Glut]] hypothesis because the dollar's reserve currency role exacerbates the U.S. current account deficit due to heightened demand for dollars.

==History==
===Onset during Bretton Woods era===
Due to money flowing out of the country through the [[Marshall Plan]], U.S. [[military budget]] and Americans [[international trade|buying foreign goods]], the number of [[United States dollar|U.S. dollars]] in circulation exceeded the amount of [[gold]] that was backing them up in 1959.

By the autumn of 1960, an ounce of gold could be exchanged for $40 in the London market even though the official rate in the United States was $35. This price difference was due to price controls on gold in the US which was fixed by the US government in 1933 following the implementation of [[Executive Order 6102]]. In USD terms, the price of gold had not changed in 27 years, this did not allow true price discovery by the free market. This price was fixed following the enactment of E.O. 6102, where the US government purchased gold from US citizens under threat of fines and/or jail time at a rate of $20.67/oz then revalued the gold overnight to $35/oz.

The solution to the Triffin dilemma for the United States was to reduce dollars in circulation by cutting the deficit and raising [[interest rates]] to attract dollars back into the country. Some economists believed both these tactics, however, would drag the U.S. economy into [[recession]].{{cn|date=June 2013}}

In support of the Bretton Woods system and to exert control over the exchange rate of gold, the United States initiated the [[London Gold Pool]] and the General Agreements to Borrow (GAB) in 1961 which sustained the system until 1967, when runs on gold and the devaluation of the [[pound sterling]] were followed by the demise of the system.

===The Balance of Payments dilemma===
In order to maintain the Bretton Woods system, the U.S. had to run a [[balance of payments]] [[current account]] '''deficit''' to provide liquidity for the conversion of gold into U.S. dollars. With more U.S. dollars in the system than were backed with gold under the Bretton Woods agreement, the U.S. dollar was overvalued. This meant that the United States had less gold as foreign governments started converting U.S. dollars to gold and taking it offshore. Foreign speculators were not a direct part of the gold flow out of the US, as under the Bretton Woods Agreement, only governments could exchange US currency for physical gold. Additionally, while the Bretton Woods Agreement was in place, direct speculation by US citizens who were banned from owning any gold other than jewelry following Executive Order 6102 which was enacted in 1933 by President Franklin D. Roosevelt and enabled the US Government to confiscate all gold coinage, gold certificates, and gold bullion held by any citizen, did not contribute to the price imbalance and arbitrage opportunity via a wide disparity of gold prices between the US and other markets. A price ceiling had been enacted which fixed the price of gold at $35/oz USD following the previously mentioned gold confiscation from US citizens in 1933. As with all price controls, this caused supply and demand imbalances and an arbitrage opportunity which rapidly depleted the United States gold reserves. This led to less gold in the country and caused the US Dollar to become more overvalued, leading to a self-propagating cycle. Furthermore, the US had to run a balance of payments current account '''surplus''' to maintain confidence in the U.S. dollar.

As a result, the United States was faced with a dilemma because it is not possible to run a balance of payments current account [[Balance of payments|deficit]] and surplus at the same time.

===The Nixon Shock===
In August 1971, President [[Richard Nixon]] acknowledged the demise of the Bretton Woods system. He announced that the dollar could no longer be exchanged for gold, which soon became known as the [[Nixon shock]].  Although it was announced as a temporary measure, it was to remain in effect. The "gold window" was closed.

==Implication in 2008 meltdown==
&lt;!--TODO: as it stands this is out of context and not very useful to a general reader. The section must first establish context, not just by its section title. Describe the 'meltdown' that is mentioned.--&gt;
In the wake of the [[financial crisis of 2007–2008]], the governor of the [[People's Bank of China]] explicitly named the Triffin Dilemma as the root cause of the economic disorder, in a speech titled ''Reform the International Monetary System''. [[Zhou Xiaochuan]]'s speech of 29 March 2009 proposed strengthening existing global currency controls, through the [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

This would involve a gradual move away from the U.S. dollar as a reserve currency and towards the use of IMF [[special drawing rights]] (SDRs) as a [[world currency|global reserve currency]].

Zhou argued that part of the reason for the original Bretton Woods system breaking down was the refusal to adopt [[Keynes]]' [[bancor]] which would have been a special international reserve currency to be used instead of the dollar.

American economists such as [[Brad DeLong]] agreed that on almost every point where Keynes was overruled by the Americans during the Bretton Woods negotiations, he was later proved correct by events.&lt;ref&gt;The reason why is simple enough to understand: To maintain the reserve currency status, money-as-debt must be created to maintain international liquidity (provide the money for transactions to take place).  This debt accumulates over time, and eventually becomes large enough that international creditors begin to question whether or not it can ever be paid back.  When that day comes, the status of that currency as a reserve currency is called into question.  Hence the "dilemma" in the name.

Zhou's proposal attracted much international attention;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; in a November 2009 article published in ''[[Foreign Affairs]]'' magazine, economist [[C.

&lt;/ref&gt; While Zhou's proposal has not yet been adopted, leaders meeting in April at the [[2009 G-20 London summit]] agreed to allow 250 billion SDRs to be created by the IMF, to be distributed to all IMF members according to each country's voting rights.

On April 13, 2010, the Strategy, Policy and Review Department of the IMF published a comprehensive report examining these aforementioned problems as well as other world reserve currency considerations, recommending that the world adopt a global reserve currency (bancor) and that a global central bank be established to administer such a currency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; In this report, the current issues with having a national global reserve currency are addressed. The merits, difficulties and effectiveness of establishing a multi-currency reserve system are weighed against that of the SDRs, or "basket currency" strategy, and those of establishing this new "global reserve currency". A new multilateral framework and "multi-polar system" for managing capital flows and national debts is also called for, but the IMF cautions that it prefers a gradual shift to this new framework, rather than a sudden change.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5752">[[File:Mercury Atlas vernier motor, Truax variant.jpg|thumb|upright|A 1960s [[Mercury-Atlas]] vernier thruster]]
[[File:Convair XSM-65B launch.jpg|thumb|upright|Vernier thrusters on the side of an [[Atlas missile]] can be seen emitting diagonal flames.]]

A '''vernier thruster''' is a [[rocket engine]] used on a [[spacecraft]] for fine adjustments to the attitude or velocity of a spacecraft. Depending on the design of a craft's maneuvering and stability systems, it may simply be a smaller thruster complementing the main propulsion system,&lt;ref name=nasa20111230/&gt; or it may complement larger [[attitude control]] thrusters,&lt;ref name=nasaRCS/&gt; or may be a part of the [[reaction control system]].
The name is derived from [[Vernier scale|vernier calipers]] (named after [[Pierre Vernier]]) which have a primary scale for gross measurements, and a secondary scale for fine measurements.

Vernier thrusters are used when a heavy spacecraft requires a wide range of different thrust levels for attitude or velocity control, as for maneuvering during docking with other spacecraft.

On space vehicles with two sizes of attitude control thrusters, the main ACS (Attitude Control System) thrusters are used for larger movements, while the verniers are reserved for smaller adjustments.

Due to their weight and the extra plumbing required for their operation, vernier rockets are seldom used in new designs.&lt;ref name=nasa20111230&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
Instead, as modern rocket engines gained better control, larger thrusters could also be fired for very short pulses, resulting in the same change of [[momentum]] as a longer thrust from a smaller thruster.

Vernier thrusters are used in rockets such as the [[R-7 (rocket family)|R-7]] for vehicle maneuvering because the main engine is fixed in place. For earlier versions of the [[Atlas rocket]] family (prior to the Atlas III), in addition to maneuvering, the verniers were used for roll control, although the booster engines could also perform this function. After sustainer engine cutoff, the verniers would execute solo mode and fire for several seconds to make fine adjustments to the vehicle attitude. The Thor/Delta family also used verniers for roll control, but were mounted on the base of the thrust section flanking the main engine.

== Examples ==
[[File:Soyuz rocket engines.jpg|thumbnail|right|The first and second-stage engines of a [[Soyuz (rocket)|Soyuz]], showing the four [[RD-107]] modules with twin vernier nozzles each, and the central RD-108 with four steerable vernier thrusters.]]

* The [[R-7 family|R-7 rocket family]], with over 1700 successful launches to date, still depends on the S1.358000 vernier thusters in its first and second stage. Most of the larger Soviet missiles and launch vehicles also used verniers. Examples include the [[RD-8]] on the [[Zenit (rocket family)|Zenit rocket family]], the [[RD-855]] and [[RD-856]] on the [[R-36 (missile)|R-36]], and the [[RD-0214]] on the [[Proton (rocket family)|Proton rocket family]].
* On the [[Atlas (rocket family)|SM-65 Atlas]], the LR-101 verniers were used for roll control and to fine-tune the vehicle attitude after main engine cutoff. The [[Delta II]] and [[Delta III]] rocket also used the LR-101 for vehicle roll maneuver since one engine cannot do a roll maneuver (although the later [[GEM 46]] had thrust vectoring nozzle, only three were equipped with this feature and only ignited a brief moment during the ascent).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=LR-101 VERNIER ENGINE|url=http://heroicrelics.org/info/lr-101/lr-101.html|website=heroicrelics.org|accessdate=24 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Space Shuttle]] [[reaction control system]] had six vernier engines or thrusters in its ''VRCS'' or "Vernier Reaction Control System" . The system could also deliver a gentle steady thrust which was regularly used to reboost the [[International Space Station]] while docked. For example, during [[STS-130]] commander [[George D. Zamka|George Zamka]] and pilot [[Terry W. Virts|Terry Virts]] fired ''[[Space Shuttle Endeavour|Endeavour]]'''s VRCS for a duration of 33 minutes to attain an orbit between 180.5 and 190.0&amp;nbsp;[[Nautical mile|nmi]].&lt;ref name=nasaRCS&gt;

The primary RCS engines provided 870 pounds of vacuum thrust each, and the verniers provided 24 pounds of vacuum thrust each. The oxidizer-to-fuel ratio for each engine is 1.6-to-1. The nominal chamber pressure of the primary thrusters was 152 [[Pounds per square inch|psia]]. For each vernier, it was 110 psia.

{{For|whistleblower protection in the United States|Whistleblower protection in the United States}}

A '''whistleblower''' (also written as '''whistle-blower''' or '''whistle blower''')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=whistleblower|title=The American Heritage Dictionary entry: whistleblower|first=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Publishing|last=Company|website=www.ahdictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a person who exposes any kind of information or activity that is deemed illegal, [[Ethics|unethical]], or not correct within an [[organization]] that is either private or public.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Whistleblowing and Organizational Social Responsibility : A Global Assessment.|last = Vandekerckhove|first = Wim|publisher = Ashgate|year = 2006|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The information of alleged wrongdoing can be classified in many ways: violation of company policy/rules, [[law]], [[regulation]], or threat to public interest/national security, as well as fraud, and [[corruption]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Organizational dissidence: The case of whistle-blowing|last = Near|first = Janet P|date = Feb 1, 1985|journal = Journal of Business Ethics|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Those who become whistleblowers can choose to bring information or allegations to surface either internally or externally. Internally, a whistleblower can bring his/her accusations to the attention of other people within the accused organization such as an immediate supervisor. Externally, a whistleblower can bring allegations to light by contacting a third party outside of an accused organization such as the media, government, law enforcement, or those who are concerned. Whistleblowers, however, take the risk of facing stiff reprisal and retaliation from those who are accused or alleged of wrongdoing.

Because of this, a number of laws exist to protect whistleblowers. Some third party groups even offer protection to whistleblowers, but that protection can only go so far. Whistleblowers face legal action, criminal charges, social stigma, and termination from any position, office, or job. Two other classifications of whistleblowing are private and public. The classifications relate to the type of organizations someone chooses to whistle-blow on: [[private sector]], or [[public sector]]. Depending on many factors, both can have varying results. However, whistleblowing in the public sector organization is more likely to result in criminal charges and possible custodial sentences. A whistleblower who chooses to accuse a private sector organization or agency is more likely to face termination and legal and civil charges.

Deeper questions and theories of whistleblowing and why people choose to do so can be studied through an [[ethical]] approach. Whistleblowing is a topic of ongoing ethical debate. Leading arguments in the ideological camp that whistleblowing is ethical maintain that whistleblowing is a form of civil disobedience, and aims to protect the public from government wrongdoing.&lt;ref&gt;Delmas, Candice. "The Ethics of Government Whistleblowing". ''Social Theory &amp; Practice''. Jan2015, Vol. 41 Issue 1, p77-105. 29p.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alford, C. Fred. "Whistleblowers and the Narrative of Ethics". ''Journal of Social Philosophy''. Winter2001, Vol. 32 Issue 4, p402-418. 17p.&lt;/ref&gt; In the opposite camp, some see whistleblowing as unethical for breaching confidentiality, especially in industries that handle sensitive client or patient information.&lt;ref&gt;Firtko, Angela; Jackson, Debra. "Do the Ends Justify the Means? Nursing and the Dilemma of Whistleblowing". ''Australian Journal of Advanced Nursing''. Sep/Nov2005, Vol. 23 Issue 1, p51-56. 6p.&lt;/ref&gt; Legal protection can also be granted to protect whistleblowers, but that protection is subject to many stipulations. Hundreds of laws grant protection to whistleblowers, but stipulations can easily cloud that protection and leave whistleblowers vulnerable to retaliation and legal trouble. However, the decision and action has become far more complicated with recent advancements in technology and [[communication]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The Ethics of Government Whisltleblowing|last = Delmas|first = Candice|date = January 2015|journal = Social Theory and Practice|doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Whistleblowers frequently face [[reprisal]], sometimes at the hands of the organization or group they have accused, sometimes from related organizations, and sometimes under law. Questions about the legitimacy of whistleblowing, the [[moral responsibility]] of whistleblowing, and the appraisal of the institutions of whistleblowing are part of the field of [[political ethics]].

==Overview==

===Origin of term===
U.S. civic activist [[Ralph Nader]] is said to have coined the phrase, but he in fact put a positive spin on the term&lt;ref&gt;See: New Scientist 9 Dec. 1971, p. 69: "The Code [of Good Conduct of The British Computer Society] contains secrecy clauses that effectively prohibit Nader style whistle-blowing"&lt;/ref&gt; in the early 1970s to avoid the negative connotations found in other words such as "informer" and "snitch".&lt;ref&gt;Nader, Petkas, and Blackwell, Whistleblowing (1972).&lt;/ref&gt; However, the origins of the word date back to the [[19th century]].

The word is linked to the use of a [[whistle]] to alert the public or a crowd about a bad situation, such as the commission of a crime or the breaking of rules during a game. The phrase ''whistle blower'' attached itself to law enforcement officials in the 19th century because they used a whistle to alert the public or fellow police.&lt;ref name="Meaning and origin"&gt;{{cite web|title=The meaning and origin of the expression: Whistle-blower|url=http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/whistle-blower.html|website=The Phrase Finder|publisher=Gary Martin|accessdate=27 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sports referees, who use a whistle to indicate an illegal or foul play, also were called whistle blowers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=whistleblower+&amp;searchmode=none |title=Etymonline.com |publisher=Etymonline.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wordorigins.org/index.php/site/whistleblower/ |title=Wordorigins.org |publisher=Wordorigins.org |date= |accessdate=2012-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An 1883 story in the ''Janesville Gazette'' called a policeman who used his whistle to alert citizens about a riot a ''whistle blower'', without the hyphen. By the year 1963, the phrase had become a hyphenated word, ''whistle-blower''. The word began to be used by journalists in the 1960s for people who revealed wrongdoing, such as Nader. It eventually evolved into the compound word ''whistleblower''.&lt;ref name="Meaning and origin" /&gt;

===Internal===
Most whistleblowers are internal whistleblowers, who report misconduct on a fellow employee or superior within their company through anonymous reporting mechanisms often called hotlines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Business Ethics: Ethical Decision Making and Cases|last=|first=|publisher=Cengage Learning|year=2017|isbn=978-1305500846|location=|pages=194|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most interesting questions with respect to internal whistleblowers is why and under what circumstances do people either act on the spot to stop illegal and otherwise unacceptable behavior or report it.&lt;ref&gt;Dealing with—or reporting—"unacceptable" behavior (with additional thoughts about the "Bystander Effect") Mary Rowe MIT, Linda Wilcox HMS, Howard Gadlin NIH (2009), ''Journal of the International Ombudsman Association'' 2(1), online at [http://www.ombudsassociation.org/publications/journal/ ombudsassociation.org]{{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090504071949/http://www.ombudsassociation.org/publications/journal/ |date=2009-05-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are some reasons to believe that people are more likely to take action with respect to unacceptable behavior, within an organization, if there are [[complaint systems]] that offer not just options dictated by the planning and control organization, but a ''choice'' of options for absolute confidentiality.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Rowe, "Options and choice for conflict resolution in the workplace" in ''Negotiation: Strategies for Mutual Gain'', by Lavinia Hall (ed.), Sage Publications, Inc., 1993, pp. 105–119.&lt;/ref&gt;

Anonymous reporting mechanisms,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2014/10/25/elements-of-an-effective-whistleblower-hotline/|title=Elements of an Effective Whistleblower Hotline|website=corpgov.law.harvard.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; as mentioned previously, help foster a climate whereby employees are more likely to report or seek guidance regarding potential or actual wrongdoing without fear of retaliation. The coming anti-bribery management systems standard, [[ISO 37001]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail?csnumber=65034|title=ISO 37001:2016 - Anti-bribery management systems -- Requirements with guidance for use|website=www.iso.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; includes anonymous reporting as one of the criteria for the new standard.

===External===
External whistleblowers, however, report misconduct to outside persons or entities. In these cases, depending on the information's severity and nature, whistleblowers may report the misconduct to [[lawyer]]s, the [[Mass media|media]], [[Law enforcement agency|law enforcement]] or [[consumer protection|watchdog agencies]], or other local, state, or federal agencies. In some cases, external whistleblowing is encouraged by offering monetary reward.

===Third party===

The third party service involves utilizing an external agency to inform the individuals at the top of the organizational pyramid of misconduct, without disclosing the identity of the whistleblower. This is a relatively new phenomenon and has been developed due to whistleblower discrimination. International Whistleblowers is an example of an organization involved in delivering a third party service for whistleblowers.

An increasing number of companies and authorities use third party services in which the whistleblower is anonymous also towards the third party service provider. This is possible via toll free phone numbers configured not to record the whistleblower origin call, and also through web solutions which apply [[Public-key cryptography|asymmetrical encryption]].

===Private sector whistleblowing===
Private sector whistleblowing, though not as high profile as public sector whistleblowing, is arguably more prevalent and suppressed in society today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = The Rise of the Whistleblower and the Death of Privacy Impact of 9/11 and Enron|last = Castagnera|first = James|date = Spring 2003|journal = Labor Law Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simply because private corporations usually have stricter regulations that suppress potential whistleblowers. An example of private sector whistleblowing is when an employee reports to someone in a higher position such as a manager, or a third party that is isolated from the individual chapter, such as their lawyer or the police. In the private sector corporate groups can easily hide wrongdoings by individual branches. It is not until these wrongdoings bleed into the top officials that corporate wrongdoings are seen by the public. Situations in which a person may blow the whistle are in cases of violated laws or company policy, such as sexual harassment or theft. These instances, nonetheless, are small compared to [[money laundering]] or [[fraud]] charges on the [[stock market]]. Whistleblowing in the private sector is typically not as high-profile or openly discussed in major news outlets, though occasionally, third parties expose human rights violations and [[exploitation of labour|exploitation of workers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Where am I wearing?|last = Timmerman|first = Kelsey|publisher = California: Wiley|year = 2012|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; While there are organizations such as the [[United States Department of Labor]] (DOL), and laws in place such as the [[Sarbanes–Oxley Act|Sarbanes-Oxley Act]] and the [[United States Federal Sentencing Guidelines]] for Organizations (FSGO) which protects whistleblowers in the private sector, many employees still fear for their jobs due to direct or indirect threats from their employers or the other parties involved. In an effort to overcome those fears, in 2010 [[Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act]] was put forth to provide great incentive to whistleblowers. For example, if a whistleblower gave information which could be used to legally recover over one million dollars; then they could receive ten to thirty percent of it.

Despite government efforts to help regulate the private sector, the employees must still weigh their options. They either expose the company and stand the moral and ethical high ground; or expose the company, lose their job, their reputation and potentially the ability to be employed again. According to a study at the University of Pennsylvania, out of three hundred whistleblowers studied, sixty nine percent of them had foregone that exact situation; and they were either fired or were forced to retire after taking the ethical high ground. It is outcomes like that which makes it all that much harder to accurately track how prevalent whistleblowing is in the private sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Business Ethics: Ethical Decision Making and Case 10th Edition|last=|first=|publisher=O.C.

===Public sector whistleblowing===
[[File:Praha, Magistrát, konference, Libor Michálek.jpg|thumb|170px|Czech whistleblower [[Libor Michálek]] was fired from his position after exposing high-level corruption]]
Recognizing the public value of whistleblowing has been increasing over the last 50 years. In the United States, both state and Federal statutes have been put in place to protect whistleblowers from retaliation. The [[United States Supreme Court]] ruled that public sector whistleblowers are protected under [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] rights from any job retaliation when they raise flags over alleged corruption.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Whistleblowing|url = http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Whistleblowing|access-date = 2015-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exposing misconduct or illegal or dishonest activity is a big fear for public employees because they feel they are going against their government and country. Private sector whistleblowing protection laws were in place long before ones for the public sector. After many federal whistleblowers were scrutinized in high-profile media cases, laws were finally introduced to protect government whistleblowers. These laws were enacted to help prevent corruption and encourage people to expose misconduct, illegal, or dishonest activity for the good of society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Whistleblower Retaliation in the Public Sector|last = Lee|first = Katie|date = 2011|journal = Public Personnel Management|doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt; People who choose to act as whistleblowers often suffer retaliation from their employer. They most likely are fired because they are an [[at-will employee]], which means they can be fired without a reason. There are exceptions in place for whistleblowers who are at-will employees. Even without a statute, numerous decisions encourage and protect whistleblowing on grounds of public policy. Statutes state that an employer shall not take any adverse employment actions any employee in retaliation for a good-faith report of a whistleblowing action or cooperating in any way in an investigation, proceeding, or lawsuit arising under said action.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Federal whistleblower legislation includes a statute protecting all government employees. In the federal civil service, the government is prohibited from taking, or threatening to take, any personnel action against an employee because the employee disclosed information that he or she reasonably believed showed a violation of law, gross mismanagement, and gross waste of funds, abuse of authority, or a substantial and specific danger to public safety or health. To prevail on a claim, a federal employee must show that a protected disclosure was made, that the accused official knew of the disclosure, that retaliation resulted, and that there was a genuine connection between the retaliation and the employee's action.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Harm ===
{{Copyedit section|date=October 2018}}
Individual harm, public trust damage, and a threat of national security are three categories of harm that may come to whistleblowers. Revealing a whistleblower's identity automatically puts their life in harm. Some media outlets associate words like "traitor" and "treason" with whistleblowers, and many countries around the world associate treason with the [[capital punishment|death penalty]], even though whoever allegedly committed treason may or may not have caused anyone physical harm.  A primary reason for the death penalty is the potential endangerment of an entire people, the perpetrator therefore being responsible for any harm to come as a result. US law states{{which|date=October 2018}},

"...whoever knowingly and willfully communicates, furnishes, transmits, or otherwise makes available to an unauthorized person, or publishes, or uses in any manner prejudicial to the safety or interest of the United States or for the benefit of any foreign government to the detriment of the United States any classified information."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 18 U.S. Code § 798 - Disclosure of classified information|url = https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/798|website = LII / Legal Information Institute|accessdate = 2015-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = The Ethics of Government Whistleblowing|last = Delmas|first = Candice|date = January 1, 2015|journal = |doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Public trust dates back to the days of the Vietnam War. Henry Kissinger once said that the purpose of "those who stole" the Pentagon Papers was to "undermine confidence in their government" and "raise doubts about our reliability in the minds of other governments, friend and foe, and indeed about the stability of our political system."

Emotional strain on the accused from the whistleblower is also unconstrained.  When a leader challenges a whistleblower, there is an automatic indictment of the leader's character.&lt;ref name="tbo.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tbo.com/list/news-opinion-commentary/william-mcraven-a-warriors-career-sacrificed-for-politics-20160424/|title=William McRaven: A warrior’s career sacrificed for politics|date=24 April 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Questioning the whistleblower makes the accused guilty until proven innocent.

=== Common reactions ===
Whistleblowers are sometimes seen as selfless [[Martyr (politics)|martyrs]] for public interest and organizational [[accountability]]; others view them as "traitors" or "defectors."  Some even accuse them of solely pursuing personal glory and fame, or view their behavior as motivated by greed in [[qui tam]] cases.  Some academics (such as [[Thomas Alured Faunce]]) feel that whistleblowers should at least be entitled to a rebuttable presumption that they are attempting to apply ethical principles in the face of obstacles and that whistleblowing would be more respected in [[governance]] systems if it had a firmer academic basis in [[virtue ethics]].&lt;ref&gt;Faunce, T.A. "Developing and Teaching the Virtue-Ethics Foundations of Healthcare Whistle Blowing", ''Monash Bioethics Review''. 2004; 23(4): 41–55&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Faunce, T.A. and Jefferys, S. "Whistleblowing and scientific misconduct: Renewing legal and virtue ethics foundations". ''Journal of Medicine and Law'' 2007, '''26(3)''': 567–84.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is probable that many people do not even consider blowing the whistle, not only because of fear of retaliation, but also because of fear of losing their relationships at work and outside work.&lt;ref&gt;Rowe, Mary &amp; Bendersky, Corinne, "Workplace Justice, Zero Tolerance and Zero Barriers: Getting People to Come Forward in Conflict Management Systems," in ''Negotiations and Change, From the Workplace to Society'', Thomas Kochan and Richard Locke (eds), Cornell University Press, 2002. See also "Dealing with&amp;nbsp;— or Reporting&amp;nbsp;— 'Unacceptable' Behavior (With additional thoughts about the 'Bystander Effect')" ©2009Mary Rowe MIT, Linda Wilcox HMS, Howard Gadlin NIH, ''Journal of the International Ombudsman Association'' 2(1), online at [http://www.ombudsassociation.org/publications/journal/ ombudsassociation.org] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090504071949/http://www.ombudsassociation.org/publications/journal/ |date=2009-05-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Persecution of whistleblowers'' has become a serious issue in many parts of the world:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Employees in academia, business or government might become aware of serious risks to health and the environment, but internal policies might pose threats of retaliation to those who report these early warnings. Private company employees in particular might be at risk of being fired, demoted, denied raises and so on for bringing environmental risks to the attention of appropriate authorities. Government employees could be at a similar risk for bringing threats to health or the environment to public attention, although perhaps this is less likely.&lt;ref name=late&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/late-lessons-2 |title=Late lessons from early warnings: science, precaution, innovation: Full Report |author=European Environment Agency) |date=Jan 23, 2013 |page=614 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

There are examples of "early warning scientists" being harassed for bringing inconvenient truths about impending harm to the notice of the public and authorities. There have also been cases of young scientists being discouraged from entering controversial scientific fields for fear of [[harassment]].&lt;ref name=late/&gt;

Whistleblowers are often protected under law from employer retaliation, but in many cases punishment has occurred, such as [[termination of employment|termination]], [[suspension (punishment)|suspension]], [[demotion]], [[wage garnishment]], and/or harsh [[mistreatment]] by other employees. A 2009 study found that up to 38% of whistleblowers experienced professional retaliation in some form, including wrongful termination.{{Citation needed|reason=previous citation of "Miceli, M. P., Near, J. P., &amp; Dworkin, T. M. (2009). Journal of Business Ethics." didn't clearly indicate a source that supports the claim.|date=January 2017}} For example, in the United States, most whistleblower protection laws provide for limited "make whole" remedies or damages for employment losses if whistleblower retaliation is proven. However, many whistleblowers report there exists a widespread "[[Shooting the messenger|shoot the messenger]]" mentality by corporations or government agencies accused of misconduct and in some cases whistleblowers have been subjected to criminal prosecution in reprisal for reporting wrongdoing.

As a reaction to this many private organizations have formed whistleblower [[legal defense fund]]s or support groups to assist whistleblowers; three such examples are the ''National Whistleblowers Center''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whistleblowers.org/ |title=whistleblowers.org |publisher=whistleblowers.org |date= |accessdate=2012-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[United States]], and ''Whistleblowers UK''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wbuk.org/ |title=wbuk.org |publisher=wbuk.org |date= |accessdate=2017-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Public Concern at Work]] (PCaW)''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcaw.co.uk |title=pcaw.co.uk |publisher=pcaw.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[United Kingdom]]. Depending on the circumstances, it is not uncommon for whistleblowers to be ostracized by their co-workers, discriminated against by future potential employers, or even fired from their organization. This campaign directed at whistleblowers with the goal of eliminating them from the organization is referred to as [[mobbing]]. It is an extreme form of [[workplace bullying]] wherein the group is set against the targeted individual.&lt;ref&gt;Matthiesen SB, Bjorkelo B, Burke RJ "Workplace Bullying as the Dark Side of Whistleblowing" in Bullying and Harassment in the Workplace: Developments in Theory, Research, and Practice (2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Psychological impact ===
There is limited research on the psychological impacts of whistle blowing. However, poor experiences of whistleblowing can cause a prolonged and prominent assault upon staff well being. As workers attempt to address concerns, they are often met with a wall of silence and hostility by management.&lt;ref&gt;Drew D (29 January 2015) [https://www.theguardian.com/healthcare-network/2015/jan/29/francis-review-nhs-whistleblower-report Francis NHS whistleblower report: a new beginning?] The Guardian&lt;/ref&gt; Some whistleblowers speak of overwhelming and persistent distress, drug and alcohol problems, [[paranoid]] behaviour at work, acute [[anxiety (mood)|anxiety]], [[nightmares]], [[Flashback (psychology)|flashbacks]] and [[intrusive thoughts]].&lt;ref name="Peters"&gt;Peters, K. et al. (2011). The emotional sequelae of whistleblowing: findings from a qualitative study. Journal of Clinical Nursing, 20: P2907-14.&lt;/ref&gt; Depression is often reported by whistleblowers, and [[suicidal thoughts]] may occur in up to about 10%.&lt;ref&gt;Farnsworth CH (22 February 1987) [https://www.nytimes.com/1987/02/22/us/survey-of-whistle-blowers-finds-retaliation-but-few-regrets.html Survey of Whistleblowers finds retaliation, but few regrets] The New York Times&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lennane"&gt;Lennane J (11 September 1993) "Whistleblowing": a health issue. 307(6905): P667–670&lt;/ref&gt; General deterioration in health and self care has been described.&lt;ref&gt;Greaves R, McGlone JK (2012) [http://www.socialmedicine.info/socialmedicine/index.php/socialmedicine/article/view/584 The Health Consequences of Speaking Out] Social Medicine Vol 6, No 4 P259-263&lt;/ref&gt; The range of symptomatology shares many of the features of [[posttraumatic stress disorder]], though there is debate about whether the trauma experienced by whistleblowers meets diagnostic thresholds.&lt;ref&gt;Bjørkelo, B. (2013). Workplace bullying after whistleblowing: Future research and implications. Journal of Managerial Psychology, 28(3), P306-323&lt;/ref&gt; Increased [[Occupational stress|stress]] related physical illness has also been described in whistleblowers.&lt;ref name="Lennane" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lennane J (17 November 1995) [https://www.uow.edu.au/~bmartin/dissent/documents/Lennane_canary.html The canary down the mine: what whistleblowers' health tells us about their environment] Paper given at Department of Criminology, Melbourne University, conference: "Whistleblowers: protecting the nation's conscience?"&lt;/ref&gt; The stresses involved in whistleblowing can be huge. As such, workers remain afraid to blow the whistle, in fear that they will not be believed or they have lost faith in believing that anything will happen if they do speak out.&lt;ref&gt;Sprinks J (2014) Survey highlights slow progress in increasing staff whistleblowing. Nursing Standard Feb 12-18;28(24) P14-5&lt;/ref&gt; This fear may indeed be justified, because an individual who feels threatened by whistleblowing, may plan the career destruction of the ‘complainant’ by reporting fictitious errors or rumours.&lt;ref&gt;De Silva, P (2014) [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pnp.344/pdf Tackling psychopathy: a necessary competency in leadership development?] Progress in Neurology and Psychiatry September/October&lt;/ref&gt; This technique, labelled as ‘[[gaslighting]]’ is a common, unconventional approach used by organizations to manage employees who cause difficulty by raising concerns.&lt;ref&gt;Lund CA, Gardiner AQ (1977) The gaslight phenomenon: An institutional variant. The British Journal of Psychiatry 131 P533–4&lt;/ref&gt; In extreme cases, this technique involves the organization or manager proposing that the complainant's mental health is unstable.&lt;ref name="Lennane2"&gt;Lennane J (May 2012) [http://www.bmartin.cc/dissent/documents/Lennane_what2.pdf What Happens to Whistleblowers and Why] Classics in Social Medicine Vol6 No4 P249-258&lt;/ref&gt; Organizations also often attempt to [[ostracise]] and [[Isolation to facilitate abuse|isolate]] whistleblowers by [[Social undermining|undermining]] their concerns by suggesting that these are groundless, carrying out inadequate investigations or by ignoring them altogether. Whistleblowers may also be disciplined, suspended and reported to professional bodies upon manufactured pretexts.&lt;ref name="Eye"&gt;Bousfield A (9 December 2011) [http://medicalharm.org/uncategorized/the-full-21-ways-to-skin-a-whistleblower/ 21 Ways To Skin An NHS Whistleblower] Medical Harm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="first"&gt;Patients First (23 Oct 2013) [http://www.patientsfirst.org.uk/?p=806 The Life Cycle of the Whistleblower])&lt;/ref&gt; Where whistleblowers persist in raising their concerns, they increasingly risk detriments such as dismissal.&lt;ref&gt;[[Public Concern at Work]] (2013) [http://www.pcaw.org.uk/files/Whistleblowing%20-%20the%20inside%20story%20FINAL.pdf Whistleblowing: The Inside Story - A study of the experiences of 100 whistleblowers] [[University of Greenwich]] research report&lt;/ref&gt;  Following dismissal, whistleblowers may struggle to find further employment due to damaged reputations, poor references and [[blacklisting]]. The social impact of whistleblowing through loss of livelihood (and sometimes pension), and family strain may also impact on whistleblowers’ psychological well being. Whistleblowers may also experience immense stress as a result of litigation regarding detriments such as unfair dismissal, which they often face with imperfect support or no support at all from unions. Whistleblowers who continue to pursue their concerns may also face long battles with official bodies such as regulators and government departments.&lt;ref name="Eye" /&gt;&lt;ref name="first" /&gt; Such bodies may reproduce the "institutional silence" by employers, adding to whistleblowers’ stress and difficulties.&lt;ref name="Parliament"&gt;[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201415/cmselect/cmpubacc/593/593.pdf Public Accounts Committee Report of Inquiry into Whistleblowing, Ninth Report of Session 2014–15])&lt;/ref&gt; In all, some whistleblowers suffer great injustice, that may never be acknowledged or rectified.&lt;ref name="Lennane2" /&gt; Such extreme experiences of threat and loss inevitably cause severe distress and sometimes mental illness, sometimes lasting for years afterwards. This mistreatment also deters others from coming forward with concerns. Thus, poor practices remain hidden behind a wall of silence, and prevent any organization from experiencing the improvements that may be afforded by intelligent failure.&lt;ref name="Peters" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Parliament" /&gt; Some whistleblowers who part ranks with their organizations have had their mental stability questioned, such as [[Adrian Schoolcraft]], the [[NYPD]] veteran who alleged falsified crime statistics in his department and was forcibly committed to a mental institution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2010/10/cop-nypd-psych-ward-whistleblowing/|title=Cop hauled off to psych ward after alleging fake crime stats|website=www.rawstory.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, the emotional strain of a whistleblower investigation is devastating to the accused's family.&lt;ref name="tbo.com"/&gt;

=== Ethics ===
The definition of [[ethics]] is the [[moral]] [[principles]] that govern a person's or group's behavior. The ethical implications of whistleblowing can be negative as well as positive. However, sometimes employees may blow the whistle as an act of revenge. [[Rosemary O'Leary]] explains this in her short volume on a topic called [[guerrilla]] government. "Rather than acting openly, guerrillas often choose to remain "in the closet," moving clandestinely behind the scenes, salmon swimming upstream against the current of power. Over the years, I have learned that the motivations driving guerrillas are diverse. The reasons for acting range from the [[altruistic]] (doing the right thing) to the seemingly petty (I was passed over for that promotion). Taken as a whole, their acts are as awe inspiring as saving human lives out of a love of humanity and as trifling as slowing the issuance of a report out of spite or anger."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Ethics of Dissent: Managing Guerrilla Government|last = O'Leary|first = Rosemary|publisher = CQ|year = 2006|isbn = |location = Washington D.C.|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, of the more than 1,000 whistleblower complaints that are filed each year with the Pentagon's Inspector General, about 97 percent are not substantiated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/checkpoint/wp/2016/04/25/commander-of-bin-laden-raid-blasts-senate-for-disrespecting-military-leaders/|title=Commander of bin Laden raid blasts Senate for disrespecting military leaders|website=Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed throughout the professional world that an individual is bound to secrecy within their work sector. Discussions of whistleblowing and employee loyalty usually assume that the concept of loyalty is irrelevant to the issue or, more commonly, that whistleblowing involves a moral choice that pits the loyalty that an employee owes an employer against the employee's responsibility to serve the public interest.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Whistleblowing and Employee Loyalty|last = Larmer|first = Robert A.|date = Feb 1992|journal = Journal of Business Ethics|doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Robert A. Larmer describes the standard view of whistleblowing in the [[Journal of Business Ethics]] by explaining that an employee possesses [[prima facie]] (based on the first impression; accepted as correct until proved otherwise) duties of loyalty and confidentiality to their employers and that whistleblowing cannot be justified except on the basis of a higher duty to the [[public good]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; It is important to recognize that in any relationship which demands loyalty the relationship works both ways and involves mutual enrichment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Whistleblowing and Employee Loyalty|last = Duska|first = Ronald|date = Feb 1992|journal = Journal of Business Ethics|doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ethics of Edward Snowden's actions have been widely discussed and debated in news media and academia worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, Mark. "EDWARD SNOWDEN: HERO OR TRAITOR? CONSIDERING THE IMPLICATIONS FOR CANADIAN NATIONAL SECURITY AND WHISTLEBLOWER LAW".&lt;/ref&gt; Edward Snowden released [[Classified information|classified]] intelligence to the American people in an attempt to allow Americans to see the inner workings of the government. A person is diligently tasked with the [[wikt:conundrum|conundrum]] of choosing to be loyal to the company or to blow the whistle on the company's wrongdoing. Discussions on whistleblowing generally revolve around three topics: attempts to define whistleblowing more precisely, debates about whether and when whistleblowing is permissible, and debates about whether and when one has an obligation to blow the whistle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Issues in Business Ethics|last = |first = |publisher = Springer|year = 2007|isbn = |location = |pages = 139–147}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Motivations ===
Many whistleblowers have stated that they were motivated to take action to put an end to unethical practices, after witnessing injustices in their businesses or organizations.&lt;ref&gt;Rice, Alexander J. "Using Scholarship on Whistleblowing to Inform Peer Ethics Reporting". Professional Psychology: Research &amp; Practice. Aug2015, Vol. 46 Issue 4: p298–305. 8p.&lt;/ref&gt; A 2009 study found that whistleblowers are often motivated to take action when they notice a sharp decline in ethical practices, as opposed to a gradual worsening.&lt;ref&gt;Gino, F., &amp; Bazerman, M. H. (2009). When misconduct goes unnoticed: The acceptability of gradual erosion in others' unethical behavior. Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, 45(4), 708-719.&lt;/ref&gt; There are generally two metrics by which whistleblowers determine if a practice is unethical. The first metric involves a violation of the organization's bylaws or written ethical policies. These violations allow individuals to concretize and rationalize blowing the whistle.&lt;ref&gt;Kaptein, Muel (2011). "From Inaction to External Whistleblowing: The Influence of the Ethical Culture of Organizations on Employee Responses to Observed Wrongdoing". Journal of Business Ethics. 98: 513.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, "value-driven" whistleblowers are influenced by their personal codes of ethics. In these cases, whistleblowers have been criticized for being driven by personal biases.&lt;ref&gt;Keenan, J. P., &amp; McLain, D. A. (1992). Whistleblowing: A conceptualization and model. In Wall, J. L., &amp; Jauch, K. R. (Eds.), Academy of Management Best Papers Proceedings, August 10–12, Las Vegas, NV, 350–352.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to ethics, social and organizational pressure are a motivating forces. A 2012 study identified that individuals are more likely to blow the whistle when several others know about the wrongdoing, because they would otherwise fear consequences for keeping silent.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, S. N., Robertson, J. C., &amp; Curtis, M. B. "The Effects of Contextual and Wrongdoing Attributes on Organizational Employees' Whistleblowing Intentions Following Fraud." Journal of Business Ethics. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; In cases when one person is causing an injustice, the individual who notices the injustice may file a formal report, rather than confronting the wrongdoer, because confrontation would be more emotionally and psychologically stressful.&lt;ref&gt;de Graaf, Gjalt (2010).

==Legality of whistleblowing==
Legal protection for whistleblowing varies from country to country and may depend on the country of the original activity, where and how secrets were revealed, and how they eventually became published or publicized. Over a dozen countries have now adopted comprehensive whistleblower protection laws that create mechanisms for reporting wrongdoing and provide legal protections to whistleblowers. Over 50 countries have adopted more limited protections as part of their anti-corruption, freedom of information, or employment laws.&lt;ref&gt;Banisar, "Whistleblowing: International Standards and Developments", in CORRUPTION AND TRANSPARENCY: DEBATING THE FRONTIERS BETWEEN STATE, MARKET AND SOCIETY, I.

===Canada===
The Office of the Public Sector Integrity Commissioner of Canada (PSIC)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psic-ispc.gc.ca/|title=Office of the Public Sector Integrity Commissioner of Canada|first=Web Experience|last=Toolkit|website=www.psic-ispc.gc.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; provides a safe and confidential mechanism enabling public servants and the general public to disclose wrongdoings committed in the public sector. It also protects from reprisal public servants who have disclosed wrongdoing and those who have cooperated in investigations. The Office's goal is to enhance public confidence in Canada's federal public institutions and in the integrity of public servants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Government of Canada|first1=PSIC|title=Background, Objectives, Scope|url=http://www.psic.gc.ca/eng/content/background-objectives-scope|publisher=Office of the Public Sector Integrity Commissioner|accessdate=16 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mandated by the Public Servants Disclosure Protection Act (The Act), PSIC is a permanent and independent Agent of Parliament. The Act, which came into force on April 15, 2007, applies to most of the federal public sector, approximately 400,000 public servants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Government of Canada|first1=PSIC|title=The Servants Disclosure Protection Act|url=http://www.psic.gc.ca/eng/aboutus/psdpa|publisher=Office of the Public Sector Integrity Commissioner|accessdate=16 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This includes government departments and agencies, parent Crown corporations, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and other federal public sector bodies.

Not all disclosures lead to an investigation as the Act sets out the jurisdiction of the Commissioner and gives the option not to investigate under certain circumstances. On the other hand, if PSIC conducts an investigation and finds no wrongdoing was committed, the Commissioner must report his findings to the discloser and to the organization's chief executive. Also, reports of founded wrongdoing are presented before the House of Commons and the Senate in accordance with The Act. As of June 2014, a total of 9 reports have been tabled in Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Government of Canada|first1=PSIC|title=Case Reports|url=http://www.psic-ispc.gc.ca/eng/wrongdoing/casereports|publisher=Office of the Public Sector Integrity Commissioner|accessdate=16 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Act also established the Public Servants Disclosure Protection Tribunal (PSDPT) to protect public servants by hearing reprisal complaints referred by the Public Sector Integrity Commissioner. The Tribunal can grant remedies in favour of complainants and order disciplinary action against persons who take reprisals.

PSIC's current Commissioner is Mr. Mario Dion. Previously, he has served in various senior roles in the public service, including as Associate Deputy Minister of Justice, Executive Director and Deputy Head of the Office of Indian Residential Schools Resolution of Canada, and as Chair of the National Parole Board.

===European Union===

The [[European Parliament]] approved a "Whistleblower Protection Directive" containing broad [[free speech]] protections for whistleblowers in both the public and the private sectors, including for [[journalist]]s, in all member states of the [[European Union]]. The Directive prohibits direct or indirect retaliation against employees, current and former, in the public sector and the private sector. The Directive's protections apply to employees, to volunteers, and  to those who assist them, including to [[civil society]] organizations and to journalists who report on their evidence. It provides equal rights for whistleblowers in the national security sector who challenge denial or removal of their security clearances. Also, whistleblowers are protected from criminal prosecution and corporate lawsuits for damages resulting from their whistleblowing, and provides for psychological support for dealing with harassment stress.&lt;ref&gt;[[Government Accountability Project]], 21 Nov. 2018, "[https://www.commondreams.org/newswire/2018/11/21/european-parliament-panel-approves-whistleblower-protections-all-eu-countries European Parliament Panel Approves Whistleblower Protections for all EU Countries]"&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Good government]] observers have hailed the EU directive as setting "the global standard for [[best practice]] rights protecting freedom of speech where it counts the most—challenging abuses of power that betray the [[public trust]]," according to the U.S.-based [[Government Accountability Project]]. They have noted, however, that ambiguities remain in the Directive regarding application in some areas, such as "duty speech," that is, when employees report the same information as part of a job assignment, for example, to a supervisor, instead of whistleblowing as formal [[dissent]]. In fact, duty speech is how the overwhelming majority of whistleblowing information gets communicated, and where the free flow of information is needed for proper functioning of organizations. However it is in response to such "duty speech" employee communication that the vast majority of retaliation against employees occurs. These observers have noted that the Directive must be understood as applying to protection against retaliation for such duty speech because without such an understanding the Directive will "miss the iceberg of what’s needed.”&lt;ref&gt;[[Government Accountability Project]], 21 Nov. 2018, "[https://www.commondreams.org/newswire/2018/11/21/european-parliament-panel-approves-whistleblower-protections-all-eu-countries European Parliament Panel Approves Whistleblower Protections for all EU Countries]"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jamaica===
In [[Jamaica]], the Protected Disclosures Act, 2011&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.japarliament.gov.jm/attachments/341_The+Protected+Disclosures+Act,+2011.pdf|title=Acts List|first=Houses of|last=Parliament|website=www.japarliament.gov.jm}}&lt;/ref&gt; received assent in March 2011. It creates a comprehensive system for the protection of whistleblowers in the public and private sector. It is based on the [[Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998]].

===India===
{{main article|Whistleblower protection in India}}
The [[Government of India]] has been considering adopting a whistleblower protection law for several years. In 2003, the Law Commission of India recommended the adoption of the Public Interest Disclosure (Protection of Informers) Act, 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lawcommissionofindia.nic.in/reports/179rptp2.pdf |title=Publin Interest Disclosure Bill |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2010, the Public Interest Disclosure and Protection of Persons Making the Disclosures Bill, 2010 was introduced into the [[Lok Sabha]], lower house of the [[Parliament of India]].&lt;ref&gt;The Public Interest Disclosure and Protection of Persons Making the Disclosures Bill, 2010 [http://www.humanrightsinitiative.org/postoftheday/PIDPPMDBill-2010.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; The Bill was approved by the cabinet in June, 2011. The Public Interest Disclosure and Protection of Persons Making the Disclosures Bill, 2010 was renamed as The Whistleblowers' Protection Bill, 2011 by the Standing Committee on Personnel, Public Grievances, Law and Justice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prsindia.org/uploads/media/Public%20Disclosure/Legislative%20Brief%20-%20Public%20Interest%20Disclosure%20Bil.pdf |title=Legislative Brief |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Whistleblowers' Protection Bill, 2011 was passed by the Lok Sabha on 28 December 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=PTI |url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/article2752946.ece |title=Whistle-blowers Bill passed |publisher=The Hindu |date=2011-12-28 |accessdate=2012-07-08 |location=Chennai, India}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by the Rajyasabha on 21 February 2014. The Whistle Blowers Protection Act, 2011 has received the Presidential assent on May 9, 2014 and the same has been subsequently published in the official gazette of the Government of India on May 9, 2014 by the Ministry of Law and Justice, Government of India.

===Ireland===
The government of [[Ireland]] committed to adopting a comprehensive whistleblower protection law in January 2012. The bill reportedly covers both the public and private sectors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Whistleblower Bill to cover public and private sectors |newspaper=Irish Times |date=30 January 2011 |url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2012/0130/1224310944604.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Netherlands===
The Netherlands has measures in place to mitigate the risks of whistleblowing: the whistleblower advice centre (Adviespunt Klokkenluiders) offers advice to whistleblowers, and the Parliament recently passed a proposal to establish a so-called house for whistleblowers, to protect them from the severe negative consequences that they might endure (Kamerstuk, 2013). Dutch media organizations also provide whistleblower support; on 9 September 2013&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vanaf vandaag: anoniem lekken naar media via doorgeefluik Publeaks|url=http://www.volkskrant.nl/vk/nl/2694/Tech-Media/article/detail/3506349/2013/09/09/Vanaf-vandaag-anoniem-lekken-naar-media-via-doorgeefluik-Publeaks.dhtml|publisher=volkskrant.nl|accessdate=22 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; a number of major Dutch media outlets supported the launch of Publeaks,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publeaks.nl|title=Publeaks - Veilig en anoniem informatie delen met de pers|website=www.publeaks.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;  which provides a secure website for people to leak documents to the media. Publeaks is designed to protect whistleblowers. It operates on the [[GlobaLeaks]] software developed by the Hermes Center for Transparency and Digital Human Rights,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://logioshermes.org|title=HERMES Center for Transparency and Digital Human Rights|website=logioshermes.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; which supports whistleblower-oriented technologies internationally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Handling ethical problems in counterterrorism An inventory of methods to support ethical decisionmaking|url=https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_reports/RR200/RR251/RAND_RR251.pdf|publisher=RAND Corporation|accessdate=24 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Switzerland===
The Swiss [[Council of States (Switzerland)|Council of States]] agreed on a draft amendment of the [[Swiss Code of Obligations]] in September 2014. The draft introduces articles 321a&lt;sup&gt;bis&lt;/sup&gt; to 321a&lt;sup&gt;septies&lt;/sup&gt;, 328(3), 336(2)(d).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Schutz bei Meldung von Unregelmässigkeiten am Arbeitsplatz|url=http://www.admin.ch/opc/de/federal-gazette/2013/9589.pdf|accessdate=22 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; An amendment of article 362(1) adds articles 321a&lt;sup&gt;bis&lt;/sup&gt; to 321a&lt;sup&gt;septies&lt;/sup&gt; to the list of provisions that may not be overruled by labour and bargaining agreements.&lt;br /&gt;
Article 321a&lt;sup&gt;ter&lt;/sup&gt; introduces an obligation on employees to report irregularities to their employer before reporting to an authority. An employee will, however, not breach his duty of good faith if he reports an irregularity to an authority and
* a period set by the employer and no longer than 60 days has lapsed since the employee has reported the incident to his employer, and
* the employer has not addressed the irregularity or it is obvious that the employer has insufficiently addressed the irregularity.
Article 321a&lt;sup&gt;quarter&lt;/sup&gt; provides that an employee may exceptionally directly report to an authority. Exceptions apply in cases
* where the employee is in a position to objectively demonstrate that a report to his employer will prove ineffective,
* where the employee has to anticipate dismissal,
* where the employee must assume that the competent authority will be hindered in investigating the irregularity, or
* where there is a direct and serious hazard to life, to health, to safety, or to the environment.
The draft does not improve on protection against dismissal for employees who report irregularities to their employer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Botschaft über die Teilrevision des Obligationenrechts |url=http://www.admin.ch/opc/de/federal-gazette/2013/9513.pdf|accessdate=23 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The amendment does not provide for employees [[Anonymity|anonymously]] filing their observations of irregularities.

===United Kingdom===
Whistleblowing in the United Kingdom is subject to the [[Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998|Public Interest Disclosure Act]] (PIDA) 1998.

The [[Freedom to Speak Up Review]] set out 20 principles to bring about improvements to help whistleblowers in the [[National Health Service|NHS]], including:
* Culture of raising concerns&amp;nbsp;– to make raising issues a part of normal routine business of a well-led NHS organization.
* Culture free from bullying&amp;nbsp;– freedom of staff to speak out relies on staff being able to work in a culture which is free from bullying.
* Training&amp;nbsp;– every member of staff should receive training in their trust's approach to raising concerns and in receiving and acting on them.
* Support&amp;nbsp;– all NHS trusts should ensure there is a dedicated person to whom concerns can be easily reported and without formality, a "speak up guardian" .
* Support to find alternative employment in the NHS&amp;nbsp;– where a worker who has raised a concern cannot, as a result, continue their role, the NHS should help them seek an alternative job.

[[Monitor (NHS)|Monitor]] produced a whistleblowing policy in November 2015 that all NHS organizations in England are obliged to follow.  It explicitly says that anyone bullying or acting against a whistleblower could be potentially liable to disciplinary action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Monitor to reveal national whistleblowing policy|url=http://www.hsj.co.uk/topics/workforce/exclusive-monitor-to-reveal-national-whistleblowing-policy/7000188.article|accessdate=18 December 2015|publisher=Health Service Journal|date=16 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
{{main article|Whistleblower protection in the United States}}
Whistleblowing tradition in the United States started with [[Benjamin Franklin]] leaking a [[Hutchinson Letters Affair|few letters Hutchinson had written to Thomas Whately]], resulting in the [[American Revolution]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}&lt;!-- Strike this entire sentence.  Franklin leaked these letters in 1773, 16 years before the "United States" was incorporated under the ratified Constitution in 1789.  There's no way to support that Franklin "started" the "tradition" of leaking embarrassing information.  Probably more accurate to attribute that honor to John Peter Zenger, but again, we're talking about the tradition within the British empire.  Also, there are dozens of "causes" of the American Revolution.  I have never heard of anyone citing the Hutchinson letter affair as one of them.    --&gt;

To be considered a whistleblower in the [[United States]], most federal whistleblower statutes require that [[federal employee]]s have reason to believe their employer violated some law, rule, or regulation; testify or commence a legal proceeding on the legally protected matter; or refuse to violate the law.

In cases where whistleblowing on a specified topic is protected by statute, U.S. courts have generally held that such whistleblowers are protected from retaliation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oalj.dol.gov/PUBLIC/WHISTLEBLOWER/REFERENCES/REFERENCE_WORKS/EDIG12.HTM |title=DOL.gov |publisher=Oalj.dol.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a closely divided [[U.S. Supreme Court]] decision, ''[[Garcetti v. Ceballos]]'' (2006) held that the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] [[free speech]] guarantees for government employees do not protect disclosures made within the scope of the employees' duties.

In the United States, legal protections vary according to the subject matter of the whistleblowing, and sometimes the state where the case arises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peer.org/state/index.php |title=Peer.org |publisher=Peer.org |date= |accessdate=2012-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In passing the 2002 [[Sarbanes–Oxley Act]], the Senate Judiciary Committee found that whistleblower protections were dependent on the "patchwork and vagaries" of varying state statutes.&lt;ref&gt;Congressional Record p. S7412; S. Rep. No. 107–146, 107th Cong., 2d Session 19 (2002).&lt;/ref&gt; Still, a wide variety of federal and state laws protect employees who call attention to violations, help with enforcement proceedings, or refuse to obey unlawful directions. While this patchwork approach has often been criticized, it also responsible for the United States having more dedicated whistleblowing laws than any other country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Transatlantic Whistleblowing.|last = Gerdemann|first = Simon|publisher = Mohr Siebeck|year = 2018|isbn = 978-3-16-155917-4|location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first US law adopted specifically to protect whistleblowers was the 1863 United States [[False Claims Act]] (revised in 1986), which tried to combat fraud by suppliers of the United States government during the [[American Civil War]]. The Act encourages whistleblowers by promising them a percentage of the money recovered by the government and by protecting them from employment retaliation.&lt;ref name="answers1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/whistleblower |title=Answers.com |publisher=Answers.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another US law that specifically protects whistleblowers is the [[Lloyd–La Follette Act]] of 1912. It guaranteed the right of federal employees to furnish information to the [[United States Congress]]. The first US environmental law to include an employee protection was the [[Clean Water Act]] of 1972. Similar protections were included in subsequent federal environmental laws, including the [[Safe Drinking Water Act]] (1974), [[Resource Conservation and Recovery Act]] (1976), [[Toxic Substances Control Act of 1976]], [[Energy Reorganization Act of 1974]] (through 1978 amendment to protect nuclear whistleblowers), [[Superfund|Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA, or the Superfund Law)]] (1980), and the [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]] (1990). Similar employee protections enforced through OSHA are included in the [[Surface Transportation Assistance Act]] (1982) to protect truck drivers, the Pipeline Safety Improvement Act (PSIA) of 2002, the [[Wendell H. Ford Aviation Investment and Reform Act for the 21st Century]] ("AIR 21"), and the Sarbanes–Oxley Act, enacted on July 30, 2002 (for corporate fraud whistleblowers).

Investigation of retaliation against whistleblowers under 20 federal statutes falls under the jurisdiction of the Office of the Whistleblower Protection Program&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whistleblowers.gov |title=Whistleblowers.gov |publisher=Whistleblowers.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[United States Department of Labor|United States Department of Labor's]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dol.gov |title=DOL.gov |publisher=DOL.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] (OSHA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osha.gov |title=Osha.gov |publisher=Osha.gov |date=2012-04-28 |accessdate=2012-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; New whistleblower statutes enacted by Congress, which are to be enforced by the Secretary of Labor, are generally delegated by a Secretary's Order&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=FEDERAL_REGISTER&amp;p_id=21749 |title=Osha.gov |publisher=Osha.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; to OSHA's Office of the Whistleblower Protection Program (OWPP).

The patchwork of laws means that victims of retaliation need to be aware of the laws at issue to determine the deadlines and means for making proper complaints. Some deadlines are as short as 10 days (Arizona State Employees have 10 days to file a "Prohibited Personnel Practice" Complaint before the Arizona State Personnel Board), while others are up to 300 days.

Those who report a false claim against the federal government, and suffer adverse employment actions as a result, may have up to six years (depending on state law) to file a civil suit for remedies under the US [[False Claims Act]] (FCA).&lt;ref&gt;{{usc|31|3730}} (h)&lt;/ref&gt; Under a ''[[qui tam]]'' provision, the "original source" for the report may be entitled to a percentage of what the government recovers from the offenders. However, the "original source" must also be the first to file a federal civil complaint for recovery of the federal funds fraudulently obtained, and must avoid publicizing the claim of fraud until the [[United States Department of Justice|US Justice Department]] decides whether to prosecute the claim itself. Such ''qui tam'' lawsuits must be filed under seal, using special procedures to keep the claim from becoming public until the federal government makes its decision on direct prosecution.

[[Espionage Act of 1917|The Espionage Act of 1917]] has been used to prosecute whistleblowers in the United States including [[Edward Snowden]] and [[Chelsea Manning]]. In 2013, Manning was convicted of violating the Espionage Act and sentenced to 35 years in prison for leaking sensitive military documents to [[WikiLeaks]].&lt;ref&gt;Madar, Chase. "The Trials of Bradley Manning".

The federally recognized [[National Whistleblower Appreciation Day]] is observed annually on July 30, on the anniversary of the country's original 1778 whistleblower protection law.

===Other countries===
There are comprehensive laws in [[New Zealand]] and [[South Africa]]. A number of other countries have recently adopted comprehensive whistleblower laws including [[Ghana]], [[South Korea]], and [[Uganda]]. They are also being considered in [[Kenya]] and [[Rwanda]]. The [[European Court of Human Rights]] ruled in 2008 that whistleblowing was protected as freedom of expression. And in February 2017, [[Nigeria]] also set up the whistleblowing policy against corruption and other ills in the country.&lt;ref&gt;Guja v. Moldova, Application no. 14277/04 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advocacy for whistleblower rights and protections==
Many [[NGOs]] advocate for stronger and more comprehensive legal rights and protections for whistleblowers. Among them are the [[Government Accountability Project]] (GAP), Blueprint for Free Speech,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blueprintforfreespeech.net/|title=Blueprint for Free Speech – Meet the whistleblowers|website=blueprintforfreespeech.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Public Concern at Work]] (PCaW) and the Open Democracy Advice Centre&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opendemocracy.org.za/|title=Home|first=Super|last=User|website=www.opendemocracy.org.za}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modern methods used for whistleblower protection ==
Whistleblowers that may be at risk of those they are exposing are now using [[encryption]] methods and anonymous content sharing software to protect their identity. [[Tor (anonymity network)|Tor]], a highly accessible anonymity network, is one that is frequently used by whistleblowers around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = https://www.usenix.org/legacy/events/sec11/tech/full_papers/Mittal.pdf|title = PIR-Tor: Scalable Anonymous Communication Using Private Information Retrieval.|last = Mittal|first = Prateek|date = 2001|journal = USENIX Security Symposium|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 10 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tor has undergone a number of large security updates to protect the identities of potential whistleblowers who may wish to anonymously leak information.&lt;ref&gt;"Security upgrade for 'anonymity network'". New Scientist. 8/11/2007, Vol. 195 Issue 2616, p23-23. 1p.&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently specialized whistleblowing software like [[SecureDrop]] and [[GlobaLeaks]] has been built on top of the Tor technology in order to incentivize and simplify its adoption for secure whistleblowing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Frediani|first1=Carola|title=After NSA Scandal, Crop of Whistleblower Communication Tools for Journalists Emerge|url=http://techpresident.com/news/24526/after-NSA-whistleblower-tools-for-journalists|website=[[TechPresident]]|accessdate=27 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Greenberg|first1=Andy|title=Whistleblowers Beware: Apps Like Whisper and Secret Will Rat You Out|url=https://www.wired.com/2014/05/whistleblowers-beware/|website=[[Wired (website)]]|accessdate=27 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In popular culture ==

In 2016, the rock band [[Thrice]] released a song titled "Whistleblower" off of the album ''[[To Be Everywhere Is to Be Nowhere]]''. The song is written from the perspective of Snowden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Montemarano|first1=Mike|url=http://www.baeblemusic.com/musicblog/4-25-2016/blood-on-the-sand-a-conversation-with-thrice.html |title='Blood on the Sand:' A Conversation With Thrice |publisher=Baeble Music |accessdate=April 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2018, [[CBS]] will debut a new reality television show entitled "[[Whistleblower_(U.S._TV_program)|Whistleblower]]", hosted by lawyer, former judge and police officer [[Alex Ferrer]] which will cover [[qui tam]] suits under the [[False Claims Act]] against companies that have allegedly defrauded the federal government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2018/07/17/plaintiffs-lawyers-get-tv-time-as-cbs-launches-whistleblower-reality-show/?slreturn=20180618111845|title=Plaintiffs Lawyers Get TV Time as CBS Launches Whistleblower Reality Show {{!}} The American Lawyer|work=The American Lawyer|access-date=2018-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27755">'''Writing across the curriculum (WAC)''' is a movement within contemporary [[composition studies]] that concerns itself with writing in classes outside of composition, literature, and other English courses. According to a comprehensive survey performed in 2006–2007, approximately half of American institutes of higher learning have something that can be identified as a WAC program.&lt;ref&gt;Thaiss, Chris, and Tara Porter. "The State of WAC/WID in 2010: Methods and Results of the U.S. Survey of the International WAC/WID Mapping Project." College Composition and Communication. 61.3 (2010): 524–70. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;

This page principally concerns itself with WAC in American colleges and universities. WAC has also been important in Britain, but primarily at the [[K–12]] level.

==History of WAC==
David Russell traces the history of WAC in the United States to the 1870s, the emergence of professional disciplines, and the new need for college-level instruction in writing.&lt;ref name="Russell"&gt;Russell, David R. Writing in the Academic Disciplines: A Curricular History. 2nd Ed. Carbondale: Southern Illinois University Press, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to this era, college students were exclusively (for all practical considerations) affluent white men whose natural discourse was identical to the approved discourse of the academy; therefore, their way of speaking and writing was already considered appropriate by and for the academy and composition didn't need to be taught at the college level. Two changes happened to motivate the need for college writing instruction. Firstly, as disciplines (as divisions within academic studies) and contemporary professions specialized, they developed their own specialized discourses. Because these discourses were not merely the same as the everyday discourse of the upper classes, they had to be taught. Secondly, as college students became more diverse – first in terms of social background and, later, in terms of gender, race, and age – not all college students grew up speaking the accepted language of the academy.

Clearly, composition courses couldn't be about the content of the writing, because content was what the other disciplines taught. Composition, therefore, had to be about the form the writing took and so "writing" was reduced to mechanics and style. Because of this reduced focus and because writing was addressed by composition, other disciplines assumed no responsibility for writing instruction; most students, then, were not taught to write in the context of their specialties. As American education became increasingly skills-oriented following World War II – in part a reaction to the suffusion of universities with war veterans in need of job training, in part a result of modeling education after the efficiency of Fordian factory production – writing instruction was further reduced to a set of skills to be mastered. Once correct (that is, standard academic) grammar, punctuation, spelling, and style were mastered – preferably before reaching the post-secondary level – there was no need for additional writing instruction save as [[remedial education]].

This product-oriented, skills-focused paradigm of writing pedagogy began to change in the 1970s with the popularization of [[James N. Britton|James Britton]] and colleagues' expressivist school of composition, which said that students benefited from writing as a tool for self-expression and that focusing on technical correctness was damaging. Janet Emig's 1977 article "Writing as a Mode of Learning," grounded in [[Constructivism (philosophy of education)|constructivist theories of education]], suggested that writing functioned as a unique and invaluable way for students to understand and integrate information. Simultaneously, widespread media attention around college students' apparently decreasing writing proficiency (more a product of the changing demographics of college students than an overt shift in teaching) provoked institutions of higher learning to reevaluate and increase the amount of writing required of students. [[Carleton College]] and Beaver College began what were probably the first contemporary WAC programs in 1974 and 1975, respectively, with faculty workshops and writing requirements shared across disciplines.&lt;ref name="Russell"/&gt;

In 2010, Thaiss and Porter defined WAC as "a program or initiative used to 'assist teachers across disciplines in using student writing as an instructional tool in their teaching'".&lt;ref&gt;Thaiss, Chris, and Tara Porter. "The State of WAC/WID in 2010: Methods and Results of the U.S. Survey of the International WAC/WID Mapping Project." College Composition and Communication. 61.3 (2010): 524–70. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; WAC, then, emerged as and remains a way to bring writing back to disciplines which had become accustomed to assigning relatively little of it. WAC has also been part of the student-centered pedagogies movement ([[student-centred learning]]) seeking to replace teaching via one-way transmission of knowledge from teacher to student with more interactive strategies that enable students to interact with and participate in creating knowledge in the classroom.

==Major theories==
WAC efforts are usually driven principally by one of two theories: writing to learn or on learning to write in disciplinary discourses, sometimes also called writing in the disciplines. Though both may be used together, one of the two theories generally guides any given writing assignment and, often, any given WAC course.

===Writing to learn===
Writing to learn is also occasionally referred to as the expressivist or cognitive mode of WAC.&lt;ref&gt;McLeod, Susan H. "Writing Across the Curriculum: An Introduction." Writing Across the Curriculum: A Guide to Developing Programs. Eds. Susan H. McLeod and Margot Soven. Newbury Park: Sage Publications, 1992. 1–11. Available at https://wac.colostate.edu/books/landmarks/mcleod-soven/&lt;/ref&gt; Writing to learn supports the use of mostly informal, often ungraded writing exercises to help students understand course content in non-English disciplines. Writing to learn assumes that being able to explain or express concepts in one's own words both builds and reflects understanding. Because the goal of writing to learn exercises is learning rather than a finished writing product, instructors are discouraged from paying attention to grammar and surface mechanics. The student himself or herself, not the teacher, is the audience. Common writing to learn exercises include reading responses, journals, [[free writing]], and multiple forms of collaborative writing.

===Writing in the disciplines===
Writing in the disciplines is also occasionally referred to as the transactional or rhetorical mode of WAC.&lt;ref&gt;McLeod, Susan H. "Writing Across the Curriculum: An Introduction." Writing Across the Curriculum: A Guide to Developing Programs. Eds. Susan H. McLeod and Margot Soven. Newbury Park: Sage Publications, 1992. 1–11. Available at https://wac.colostate.edu/books/landmarks/mcleod-soven/&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in the Disciplines (WID) teaches students how to write acceptably in their respective disciplines.&lt;ref&gt;Brian Sutton. "Writing in the Disciplines, First-Year Composition, and the Research Paper." Language and Learning Across the Disciplines. (1997): 46-57. Available at https://wac.colostate.edu/llad/v2n1/sutton.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in the Disciplines classes teach students to learn to write texts that they will apply in their scholarly and professional lives.&lt;ref&gt;McLeod, Susan H. "Writing Across the Curriculum: An Introduction." Writing Across the Curriculum: A Guide to Developing Programs. Eds. Susan H. McLeod and Margot Soven. Newbury Park: Sage Publications, 1992. 1–11. Available at https://wac.colostate.edu/books/landmarks/mcleod-soven/&lt;/ref&gt; Although WID and WAC are correlated, WID emphasizes disciplinary orientation. The students’ participation in their majors enlists the students in [[discourse communities]], which are social groups that communicate, at least in part, via written texts and share common goals, values, and writing standards. These writing standards include but are not limited to specialized vocabularies and particular genres.&lt;ref&gt;Academic Writing Program. "What is "Writing in the Disciplines?"" Faculty of Art and Science, Academic Writing Program. University of Lethbridge, 2006. &lt;/ref&gt; The goal of WID is to allow students to demonstrate writing skills within the genres expected in academic and professional discourse communities.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Bazerman. "Encyclopedia of English Studies "Writing in the Disciplines". Southern Illinios UP, 1993.
&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing in the discipline courses are commonly referred to as Writing Intensive courses(WI).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book |last1=McLeod |first1=Susan H. |last2=Soven |first2=Margot |title=Writing Across the Curriculum: A Guide to Developing Programs|publisher=WAC Clearinghouse Landmark Publications in Writing Studies |date=2000 |chapter=Chapter 6: Writing-Intensive Courses: Tools for Curricular Change |url=https://wac.colostate.edu/books/landmarks/mcleod-soven/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing Intensive courses were developed for two reasons: 1) Students' writing skills would decrease if not consistently reinforced. 2) Students' writing improves significantly when they write involving their major.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The controversy surrounding WID is who holds responsibility for teaching WID courses. The different models for teaching WID classes are the following: 1) The English department faculty teaches writing courses focused on individual disciplines. 2) English departments and other discipline departments collaborate on instructing writing courses for particular majors.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 3) Individual faculty of respective disciplines teach writing for their respective disciplines.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jonathan|first=Monroe,|date=2003-10-01|title=Writing and the Disciplines|url=https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1P3-592166031/writing-and-the-disciplines|journal=Peer Review|language=en|volume=6|issue=1|issn=1541-1389}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars agree that each university decides which model works best for their institution. The University of San Francisco has implemented model one to teach their [https://www.usfca.edu/catalog/course/203-writing-psychology Writing in Psychology course(RHET 203)].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Cornell University has used model two to teach their [http://courses.cornell.edu/preview_course_nopop.php?catoid=31&amp;coid=494579 Technical Writing course(WRIT 7100)].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The University of Missouri employs the third model to teach their [https://cwp.missouri.edu/wi/courses/spring-2018/ Process Synthesis and Design course - Writing Intensive(CH_ENG 4980W)]&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;.

==WAC structure and implementation==
WAC may exist as a formal program housed in or attached to an English department, a formal program as a free-standing unit reporting directly to a dean or vice president, a program attached to an all-campus [[writing center]], or an informal initiative in which faculty voluntarily participate. The WAC director, at most universities, is a tenure-track professor.&lt;ref&gt;Thaiss, Chris, and Tara Porter. "The State of WAC/WID in 2010: Methods and Results of the U.S. Survey of the International WAC/WID Mapping Project." College Composition and Communication. 61.3 (2010): 524–70. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; WAC programs are often administered by a WAC director, frequently with the aid of a WAC faculty committee, and are sometimes staffed by undergraduate or graduate student assistants (also referred to as tutors, consultants, or fellows.)

===WAC workshops===
Workshops at which faculty from many disciplines meet to share ideas about and strategies around writing are a primary way in which WAC is enacted.&lt;ref&gt;Walvoord, Barbara E. "Getting Started." Writing Across the Curriculum: A Guide to Developing Programs. Eds. Susan H. McLeod and Margot Soven. Newbury Park: Sage Publications, 1992. 12–31. Available at https://wac.colostate.edu/books/landmarks/mcleod-soven/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thaiss, Chris, and Tara Porter. "The State of WAC/WID in 2010: Methods and Results of the U.S. Survey of the International WAC/WID Mapping Project." College Composition and Communication. 61.3 (2010): 524–70. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;

Workshops serve multiple functions including:
* Encouraging community amongst faculty interested in WAC&lt;ref&gt;Magnotto, Joyce Neff and Barbara R. Stout. "Faculty Workshops." Writing Across the Curriculum: A Guide to Developing Programs. Eds. Susan H. McLeod and Margot Soven. Newbury Park: Sage Publications, 1992. 32–46. Available at https://wac.colostate.edu/books/landmarks/mcleod-soven/&lt;/ref&gt;
* Allowing WAC faculty (often, but not always from English or composition studies) to share knowledge about writing to learn, writing process, providing student feedback, and other composition scholarship
* Providing a forum for open discussion about writing and teaching
* Giving faculty themselves an opportunity to experiment with different writing strategies including collaborative writing and peer-review and to experience something of how these strategies may feel for their students&lt;ref&gt;Sandler, Karen Wiley. "Starting a WAC Program: Strategies for Administrators." Writing Across the Curriculum: A Guide to Developing Programs. Eds. Susan H. McLeod and Margot Soven. Newbury Park: Sage Publications, 1992. 47–57. Available at https://wac.colostate.edu/books/landmarks/mcleod-soven/&lt;/ref&gt;

A major complaint against the workshop model of WAC is that it can encourage the mindset that writing pedagogy is relatively simple and can be mastered in a few days, whereas using writing effectively (in English or non-English classes) is widely recognized as taking years of practice.&lt;ref&gt;Ochsner, Robert, and Judy Fowler. "Playing Devil's Advocate: Evaluating the Literature of the WAC/WID Movement." Review of Educational Research 74.2 (2004): 117 -140. Web. 1 Sept. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

===WAC in upper-division courses===
On a programmatic level, WAC most often manifests as some kind of writing-intensive (also called writing-enriched or writing-in-the-major) courses. Courses carrying this designation typically meet university-wide criteria including a minimum number of pages or words students write over the semester (or some other measure of writing frequency), opportunity for revision, and deriving a significant portion of the final grade from writing. Writing-intensive courses also often have relatively small enrollment limits (15–35 students depending on institution) and may require faculty to participate in WAC-related professional development activities.&lt;ref&gt;Farris, Christine and Raymond Smith. "Writing-Intensive Courses: Tools for Curricular Change." Writing Across the Curriculum: A Guide to Developing Programs. Eds. Susan H. McLeod and Margot Soven. Newbury Park: Sage Publications, 1992. 71–86. Available at https://wac.colostate.edu/books/landmarks/mcleod-soven/&lt;/ref&gt;

The rationale for writing-intensive coursework includes:
* ''Writing practice'' – as with any other skill, students' writing abilities will atrophy if they are left unpracticed; writing-intensive courses ensure that students continue to write after leaving [[first-year composition]]
* ''Writing to learn'' – contemporary composition theory holds that incorporating active writing promotes student engagement and, therefore, learning
* ''Professionalization'' – writing-intensive courses directed at upper-division major students provide an opportunity for students to learn the communication skills expected of professionals in their anticipated fields

===WAC in first-year composition===
While WAC is usually understood as distributing writing across the curriculum in courses outside of English departments, a WAC philosophy can also influence the structure of first-year composition courses. Because first-year composition is often the only writing course students take, the composition of the class can shape students' understanding of what writing is.&lt;ref&gt;Peterson, Linda H. "Writing Across the Curriculum and/in the Freshman English Program." Writing Across the Curriculum: A Guide to Developing Programs. Newbury Park: Sage Publications, 1992. 58–70.Available at https://wac.colostate.edu/books/landmarks/mcleod-soven/&lt;/ref&gt; Incorporating writing from diverse academic genres can therefore expand students' expectations about what constitutes "writing." WAC in first-year composition owes much to genre theory ([[genre studies]]) which asks students to think about the classification and rhetorical implications of writing within socially constructed genres.

== Writing-Enriched Curriculum ==
'''Writing-Enriched Curriculum (or WEC)''' is a movement that scholars have recently started to implement in composition programs across the U.S. With its basic premise reflecting WAC's integration of writing throughout all student's courses, WEC aims to focus on faculty involvement in devising a writing program that is effective and relevant for students in their various fields &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Writing-Enriched Curriculum|url=https://wec.umn.edu/|website=University of Minnesota|accessdate=20 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Precursors of WEC ===
In the late 1990's, North Carolina State University developed an approach to writing across the curriculum that involved extensive consultation by writing experts with individual departments. These consultations began with a focus on the qualities and characteristics faculty felt that student majors would exhibit if they were strong communicators. Those discussions led to the articulation of learning outcomes for both writing and oral communication. The departments then developed implementation plans that could help them reach the outcomes, followed or preceded by plans for assessing student abilities in order to further refine or project plans for implementation. &lt;ref&gt;Carter, Michael (2003) A Process for Establishing Outcomes-Based Assessment Plans for Writing and Speaking in the Disciplines, Language and Learning Across the Disciplines, 6:1, 4-29. Available at https://wac.colostate.edu/llad/v6n1/carter.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  &lt;ref&gt;Anson, Chris M. (2006) Assessing Writing in Cross-Curricular Programs: Determining the Locus of Activity. Assessing Writing, 11, 100-112.&lt;/ref&gt; The Campus Writing and Speaking Program, directed since 1999 by Distinguished Professor Chris Anson (www.ansonica.net), provided much of the support for this campus-wide approach. A few years into the program's existence, Anson and colleague Michael Carter (who is often credited with originating the departmentally-focused conversations on which WEC is founded) consulted with Pamela Flash at the University of Minnesota (where Anson had been a professor for 15 years) to help them spearhead a similar effort. Minnesota branded their program and design "WEC," although now the acronym is becoming generalized as other institutions adopt the approach.

WEC is a developing concept relating to WAC; the acronym was created by Pamela Flash and her colleagues at The University of Minnesota. Flash is the university's director of Writing Across the Curriculum, founding director of the Writing-Enriched Curriculum and co-director of the writing center. &lt;ref&gt;Heidi E. Wagner, A.

Document ID: 019c5924-9dc0-4eaa-929a-9aeff57bd454&lt;/ref&gt; As a pioneer of the WEC writing instruction model, the University of Minnesota  has had its faculty enroll up to 5 units of WEC plans per year into the undergraduate curriculum for up to 10 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://wec.umn.edu/about|title=About|last=hinte019|date=2016-10-06|work=WEC|access-date=2018-04-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The WEC model ===
According to the WEC website at the University of Minnesota,&lt;Writing-Enriched Curriculum Program&gt; &lt;/https://wec.umn.edu/&gt; WEC is a faculty-driven method to ensuring the effective, intentional integration of relevant writing and writing instruction into disciplinary curricula. The WEC model created by Writing Across the Curriculum director Pamela Flash and colleagues and initially implemented by the University of Minnesota involves departmental faculty in developing a locally relevant Writing Plan. The outlining of plans is attempted through collaborative discussions between numerous departmental faculty and specialists in both writing and assessment and the consideration of previous attempts at effective writing instruction. Some of the content under consideration include writing assessments, locally collected data, stakeholder surveys and writing expectations from instructors. The outcome of this meetings is pronounced expectations and plans for relevant instructions to be implemented in the curricula. &lt;ref&gt; (Flash 2016 Fr o m A ppr i s e d to Revi s e d Faculty in the Disciplines Change What They Never Knew They Knew) https://wec.umn.edu/sites/wec.umn.edu/files/flash_chapter2016.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The next step is the application of the plan into the undergraduate curriculum and assessing Undergraduate Writing Plans. Integrating the WEC model is anticipated to show improvements in writing instruction at a rate that would meet faculty expectations. Each of three writing plans is tested for 1-3 academic years through multiple outlets; internal curricular study and structural changes, material development, writing workshops, seminars, and panels, and additional research. The feasibility of each edition of these writing plans is assessed by a subcommittee of the Faculty Senate; the Campus Writing Board. Contributions to writing plan assessment include triennial panel ratings of student writing against faculty expectations and criteria. The results are then used to guide future writing plans. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://wec.umn.edu/wec-model|title=WEC Model|last=mollyb|date=2017-03-27|work=WEC|access-date=2018-04-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The principles of WAC and the WEC model ===
Because WEC closely reflects WAC, the principles that Barbara Walvoord&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Walvoord|first1=Barbara|title=Getting Started.

* Including colleagues from various disciplines, including teaching assistants and students, as they will all be affected by the WAC program the most.
* Discussing what needs and concerns need to be met with a WAC program and who will be willing to dedicate time to implementing the curriculum.
* What changes will be made to address this-- whether it be in school-wide assessments, writing centers or classroom methods 
* School administrators will then oversee and facilitate WAC but should not be seen as dictators.

Similarly, both Anson's approach at NC State and Pamela Flash's model at the University of Minnesota reflect the same idea of coming together with faculty members from various fields throughout the curriculum and implementing these changes cohesively&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Writing Plans|url=https://wec.umn.edu/writing-plans|website=University of Minnesota|accessdate=20 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The main point of difference between WAC and WEC, however, is that WEC requires faculty to maintain intentional support activity and assessment of how the program is affecting their students and to make changes, if necessary&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Research &amp; Assessment|url=https://wec.umn.edu/research-assessment|website=University of Minnesota|accessdate=20 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. By comparison, WAC does not require routinely assessment as part of its model. Like WAC, Flash's WEC model also requires ongoing implementation and incremental direct and indirect assessment, which allows the faculty-implemented plans to sustain. Anson's program at NC State revisits departments to conduct "profiles" of their efforts, resulting in a formative report for the department's use&lt;ref&gt; Anson, Chris M., &amp; Dannels, D. P. (2009). Profiling Programs: Formative Uses of Assisted Descriptions in the Assessment of Communication Across the Curriculum. Across the Disciplines, 6 Available at https://wac.colostate.edu/docs/atd/assessment/anson_dannels.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; According to Flash, WEC differs from most WAC programming in its departmental locus and its direct focus on the ways that faculty members in diverse disciplines conceptualize writing and writing instruction. &lt;ref&gt;Flash, P. (2016) Flash, P. (2016). From apprised to revised: Faculty in the disciplines change what they never knew they knew. In Yancey, K.B. (Ed.) A Rhetoric of Reflection (pp. 227-249).

== Criticisms ==
P.A. Ramsay, in his paper Writing across the curriculum: Integrating discourse communities in the academy, found that students that participate in WAC programs become better communicators in their chosen discipline and demonstrated improved critical/analytical thinking.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Ramsay, P.A. (2008). ''Writing across the curriculum: Integrating discourse communities in the academy.'' Kingston, Jamaica: School of Education, University of West Indies.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Disadvantages of WAC include fears that the teaching style will reduce the available time to teach content material, difficuties getting teachers "on board" with the style, as well as fears that the teacher is illequipped to teach writing.Ramsay also found while working in [[Jamaica]], that students who were unable to compose in their first language (either because of academic defficiencies or because the language did not have a written language) had difficulties composing in their second language using WAC practices.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This was a sentiment echoed by Alexander Friedlander, who in his research found that students unable to write in their first language will have great difficulty writing in their second language regardless of whether their instruction has used WAC strategies.&lt;ref&gt;Friedlander, A. (1990). Composing in English: Effects of a first language on writing in English as a second language. In B.Kroll(Ed.), S''econd language writing: Research insights for the classroom'' (pp. 109-125).
