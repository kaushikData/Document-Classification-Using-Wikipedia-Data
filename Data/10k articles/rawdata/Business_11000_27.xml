The '''National City Bank Building''' at '''55 Wall Street''' between William and Hanover Streets in the [[Financial District, Manhattan|Financial District]] of downtown [[Manhattan]], [[New York City]], was built in 1836–1841 as the '''Merchants' Exchange''', replacing the previous exchange, which had opened in 1827 and burned down in the [[Great Fire of New York]] in 1835.&lt;ref name=aia5 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author =Staff|title= The Picture of New-York, and Stranger's Guide to the Commercial Metropolis of the United States|url= https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=loc.ark:/13960/t51g0vs4w;view=1up;seq=226|location= New York|publisher= A. T. Goodrich|date= 1828|isbn= |accessdate= December 3, 2013 |page=206}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The new building was designed by [[Isaiah Rogers]] in the [[Greek Revival architecture|Greek Revival style]]. The [[United States Custom House (New York City)|United States Custom House]] moved into the building in 1862 &amp;ndash; with the conversion of the building overseen by [[William A. Potter]] &amp;ndash; and occupied it until 1907, when it moved to the [[Alexander Hamilton U.S. Custom House]] at 1 [[Bowling Green (New York City)|Bowling Green]].&lt;ref name=nycland /&gt;

After the Custom House left, [[James Stillman]], president of National City Bank (predecessor bank of [[Citibank]]), arranged for his company to buy the building from the government to be their headquarters.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110605230233/http://tps.cr.nps.gov/nhl/detail.cfm?ResourceID=1774&amp;resourceType=Building NHL Details ]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles Follen McKim]]&lt;ref name=nrhpinv/&gt; of [[McKim, Mead &amp; White]] was engaged to enlarge the building, including removing the dome, adding four floors and a second colonnade and gutting the interior, the main floor of which McKim redesigned with William S. Richardson (1907-1910). The old main banking hall has been used as a ballroom and event space since 1998, and the remainder of the building is now condominium apartments.&lt;ref name=nycland /&gt;&lt;ref name=aia5&gt;{{cite aia5}}, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;

55 Wall Street became the new home of National City Bank on December 19, 1908, when the bank moved across the street from 52 Wall Street. Stillman ordered that the building's Ionic colonnade be preserved and that the interior be remodeled to look like the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]] in [[Rome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=van B.

55 Wall Street served as [[Citibank]]'s global headquarters from 1908 to 1961, when it moved to the newly completed [[399 Park Avenue]], one of the earlier migrations by Wall Street commercial and investment banks from downtown to midtown Manhattan.&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20020220103144/http://www.nybookdistributors.com/wall_street/feature/citibank.html&lt;/ref&gt;  Years after the headquarters move, 55 Wall Street continued as a full service retail branch (still carrying the moniker Branch # 001), as well as a substantial location for private banking operations. The building served as the headquarters for the law firm of [[Shearman &amp; Sterling]], lead counsel for [[Citibank]] and the [[Rockefeller family]] for decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/23/realestate/commercial-property-55-wall-street-for-film-makers-least-lemon-becomes-plum.html |title=Commercial Property/55 Wall Street - For Film Makers at Least, a Lemon Becomes a Plum |first=Claudia H. |last=Deutsch |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=October 23, 1994 |accessdate=September 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The building was sold by Citibank in 1990 to private investors for $69 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.nytimes.com/1990/04/08/realestate/commercial-property-55-wall-street-foreign-buyers-get-costly-piece-americana.html |title=Commercial Property - 55 Wall Street - Foreign Buyers Get a Costly Piece of Americana |first=David W. |last=Dunlap |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=April 8, 1990 |accessdate=September 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Citibank ended its branch banking presence at 55 Wall Street in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.neighborhoodpreservationcenter.org/db/bb_files/1999NationalCityBankBuildInterior.pdf |title=(Former) National City Bank Building |work=New York Landmarks Preservation Commission |date=January 12, 1999 |accessdate=September 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is currently owned by [[Cipriani]].

Notable people who spent time at 55 Wall Street include President [[Chester A. Arthur]], who worked as a customs collector in the 1870s, and writer [[Herman Melville]], who worked as a customs inspector and wrote part of ''[[Moby Dick]]'' while working there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://money.cnn.com/1996/09/30/bizbuzz/trump/ |title=The Donald and The Deal |date=September 30, 1996 |work=CNN.com |accessdate=5 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architecture==
[[File:Cipriani Wall Street set up for the 74th Annual Peabody Awards.jpg|thumb|left|55 Wall Street ballroom prepared for the 74th Annual [[Peabody Awards]]]]
[[File:(King1893NYC) pg790 THE OLD MERCHANTS' EXCHANGE ON WALL STREET.jpg|thumb|In the late 19th century the building still had its dome]]

The original building was designed by Boston architect [[Isaiah Rogers]] in the [[Greek Revival architecture|Greek Revival style]] and built in 1836–1842. The facade of the original four-story, Greek revival style featured twelve massive Ionic columns, each a single block of Quincy Granite.

In 1899, National City Bank, which subsequently became Citibank, commissioned architect Charles McKim of [[McKim, Mead &amp; White]] to remodel the building for use as their headquarters. The architects added four stories to the building and superimposed a second colonnade of Corinthian columns above the original facade. They also redesigned the interior into an immense banking hall (at the time constituting the largest bank branch in the world measuring 188 feet in length and 124 feet in width, known as the Great Hall),&lt;ref name=citibank15&gt;Citibank. p.15&lt;/ref&gt; featuring a sixty-foot-high central dome and offices at each corner. Monumental Corinthian columns support an elegant entablature that circles the space. The room features elegant gray marble floors and walls, a coffered ceiling, and delicate mezzanine railings.

According to ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine back in 1917, the branch at 55 Wall Street "does more business in its head office than is done under any other nongovernmental banking roof on the face of the earth." &lt;ref&gt;Citibank. p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;

The exterior of this building was designated a New York City Landmark in 1965. The building was named a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 1978.&lt;ref name="nrhpinv"&gt;{{cite web|url={{NHLS url|id=78001875}} &lt;!--"National City Bank (Merchant's Exchange)", December 1976, by George R. Adams --&gt; |format=pdf|title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory-Nomination|date=December 1976 |publisher=National Park Service}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nhlsum"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nrhpphotos"&gt;{{cite web|url={{NHLS url|id=78001875|photos=y}} &lt;!--National City Bank (Merchant's Exchange)--Accompanying photos, 2 exterior and 1 interior, from 1976. --&gt; |format=pdf|title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory-Nomination|date=December 1976 |publisher=National Park Service}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998 it was completely rebuilt as The Regent Wall Street Hotel. After the [[September 11 attacks]] on the World Trade Center in 2001, 55 Wall Street served as a relief center for workers and area residents. The hotel closed in 2003 due to lack of business after the 9/11 attacks. It has recently been renovated again and was converted to condos by the [[Cipriani S.A.]] empire of restaurants and ballrooms.  The main banking hall "now serves as one of the most elegant ballrooms in the world",&lt;ref name="1000nycbldg"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Harris |first=Bill |title=One Thousand New York Buildings |edition=1st |publisher=Black Dog and Leventhal |year=2002 |isbn=1-57912-443-7 |page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has been called a "facility unequaled in America"&lt;ref name="AIA"&gt;{{cite AIA4}}, p.17&lt;/ref&gt;

A curious remnant of the building's days as a customs house were the jail cells used to detain smugglers and spies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.nytimes.com/1998/11/29/realestate/commercial-property-55-wall-street-temple-capitalism-all-suite-hotel.html |title=Commercial Property / 55 Wall Street - From Temple of Capitalism to an All-Suite Hotel |first=John |last=Holusha |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=November 29, 1998 |accessdate=September 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also when National City Bank was doing renovations in 1908 it uncovered a cannonball embedded in a wall as well as keg of gunpowder and over 100 rudimentary bombs, believed to be armaments for Customs House employees during the [[New York City draft riots]] of 1863.&lt;ref name=citibank15 /&gt;

The Designated Landmark of New York City plaque was installed by the New York Landmarks Preservation Foundation in 2002.{{clear left}}

==In popular culture==
*The building was the location for the finale of [[Jonathan Demme]]'s 2004 film ''[[The Manchurian Candidate (2004 film)|The Manchurian Candidate]]'', and was also used as a backdrop for ''[[Die Hard with a Vengeance]]'' and ''[[The Dark Knight Rises]]''.

'''Alfredo Woodward Téllez''' (1905–1988) was a [[Mexico|Mexican]] businessman, politician and member of the [[Institutional Revolutionary Party]]. He was born in Oaxaca City, Oaxaca, on December 9, 1905 and died of old age on April 25, 1988. He was the son of American William John Woodward and Josefina Tellez Gil.

==Career==
Woodward arrived in [[Manzanillo, Colima]], as manager of the customs agency, Alberto P. Rojas and sons, a powerful business that was based at the corner of Calle Donceles in Mexico City and had branches in [[Veracruz]], [[Tamaulipas]], [[Chihuahua, Chihuahua|Chihuahua]], [[Chiapas]], [[Oaxaca]], [[Sinaloa]], [[Sonora]] and [[Texas]]. He held many other types of employment before becoming an entrepreneur, such as police, driver, desk clerk, carrier and film actor.

Woodward came to possess, in addition, a whole fishing fleet. During World War II he was devoted to fishing for shark and hammerhead, exporting large quantities of shark parts to be used for the manufacture of vitamin A. Together with Guillermo Adachi and Luis Garcia Castillo, he was one of the most active promoters of the International Tournament of Sailfishing in Manzanillo, participating in that sport for many years. 

==Political career==
Woodward was local deputy to the [[Colima]] Congress for the XXXVII Legislature (1954 - 1955). He was mayor of the city of [[Manzanillo, Colima|Manzanillo]] in Colima state during the period 1951 to 1954. He was Communicator of the Beacons of the Navy Department in the Mexican Pacific.

==Legacy==
Woodward 's name is linked to the work and policies of the Manzanillo port, either through the customs business of his son Guillermo Woodward Rojas or through Alfredo Woodward Rojas, former candidate for president and municipal councilor for the [[Democratic Revolutionary Party]].

Not all biologics are regulated by CBER. [[Monoclonal antibodies]] and other therapeutic proteins are regulated by the FDA [[Center for Drug Evaluation and Research]] (CDER).

==Scope==
*[[Blood]] for transfusion and as a raw material for drug products, as well as reagents used for blood typing and other related activities -and- [[Blood plasma|plasma]] derivatives, including [[intravenous immunoglobulin|immunoglobulins]], [[Hyperimmune globulin|hyperimmune]] products, and [[antitoxin]]s.
**Blood and blood products activities are managed through the Office of Blood Research and Review (OBRR)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fda.gov/AboutFDA/CentersOffices/OfficeofMedicalProductsandTobacco/CBER/ucm602922.htm|title=Director, Office of Blood Research and Review (OBRR)|last=&lt;!-- no byline --&gt;|first=|date=28 March 2018|website=About the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research|publisher=FDA|type=Job posting|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=28 March 2018}}{{self-published source|date=March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Human cells, tissues, and cellular and tissue-based products (HCT/Ps), except vascularized organs for transplantation and the associated blood vessels.
*[[Vaccine]]s for use in humans.
*Diagnostic and therapeutic [[Allergen|allergenic extracts]].
*Live biotherapeutics ([[probiotic]]s).
*Some medical devices, specifically test kits for [[HIV]], tests used to screen blood donations, blood bank collection machines and equipment, and blood bank computer software.
*[[Xenotransplantation]]
*Historically, CBER was responsible for some therapeutic proteins, such as monoclonal antibodies.  Control of these has been transferred to CDER.  Some other drugs, such as certain anticoagulants and plasma volume expanders remain under the control of CBER.

==Authority==
As of July 2006 CBER's authority resides in sections 351 and 361 of the [[Public Health Service Act]] and in various sections of the [[Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fda.gov/AboutFDA/CentersOffices/OfficeofMedicalProductsandTobacco/CBER/default.htm CBER website, About CBER] Retrieved August 30, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Section 351 of the Public Health Service Act requires licensure of biological products that travel in [[Commerce Clause|interstate commerce]] in the [[United States]].  CBER may deny licensure or suspend or cancel a current license if a manufacturer does not comply with requirements.  Unlicensed blood products used within the boundaries of a state are not unusual, and these products are subject to general regulations from other FDA legal authorities.

Section 361 of the same act allows the [[Surgeon General of the United States|Surgeon General]] to make and enforce regulations to control the interstate spread of communicable disease.  This broad authority has been delegated to the FDA through a Memorandum of Understanding.  Many of the products overseen by CBER are also considered drugs, and are subject to the same rules and regulations as any other drug product from the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.

From these legal authorities, CBER publishes regulations which are included in the first chapter [[Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations]].  Most of the regulations specific to CBER are found from 21CFR600-680.  21CFR1271 contains the rules for HCT/Ps.  For products which are also drugs, such as blood for [[Blood transfusion|transfusion]], rules in 21CFR200 and following apply.  Other general rules, such as the regulations for clinical trials involving human subjects in 21CFR50, may also apply.

In addition to these laws and guidances, CBER also publishes guidance documents.  These are not requirements, but are generally followed by industry.  Licensed manufacturers are expected to adopt either the guidance or an equivalent process.  In some cases, the guidance documents have the force of regulation because they are written to clarify existing rules.

==Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System==

As of 2003, the [[Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System]] was based on a data integration platform from [[Informatica]]. The FDA uses this software to analyze data on adverse reactions to vaccines and other biologicals in order to improve regulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Keeping the public healthy |newspaper=KM World
 |date=October 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Flu vaccines==

CBER's Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee meets annually for a discussion and vote concerning the next year's [[influenza vaccine]] virus selection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://origin.www.fda.gov/ohrms/dockets/ac/05/transcripts/2005-4087T1.DOC |website=origin.www.fda.gov |title=Transcript of U.S. FDA Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee's 101st meeting of February 16, 2005 |format=DOC }}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/search?q=cache:8hPXwU4pfyAJ:origin.www.fda.gov/ohrms/dockets/ac/05/transcripts/2005-4087T1.DOC+CDC+H5N1+research+%22two+clades%22&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=18|title=in Google provided HTML format|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Review and approval times==

According to numbers from the FDA, in 2001 the CBER reviewed 16 Biologics License Applications (BLAs) with a median review time of 13.8 months and a median approval time of 20.3 months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=ZOON RESIGNS POSITION AT CBER, PLANS MOVE TO CANCER INSTITUTE |author=Kim Coghill |newspaper=BIOWORLD Today |date=16 December 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
CBER's history began with [[Jim (horse)|a horse named Jim]], a vaccine-contamination scandal that prompted the [[Biologics Control Act]] of 1902.  Originally, CBER was part of what became the [[National Institutes of Health]], rather than the FDA.&lt;ref name=Reid /&gt;  Its mission included a mandate to foster the development of new vaccines.&lt;ref name=Reid /&gt;  

The Bureau was transferred from the NIH to the FDA in 1972, where it was renamed  '''Bureau of Biologics''' and focused on vaccines, serums for [[allergy shot]]s, and blood products.&lt;ref name=Reid /&gt;  

Ten years later, with the beginning of the [[biotechnology revolution]], the line between a drug and a biologic, or a device and a biologic, became blurred.&lt;ref name=Reid /&gt;  It was merged with the FDA's Bureau of Drugs to form the ''Center for Drugs and Biologics'' during an agency-wide reorganization under Commissioner [[Arthur Hayes]].&lt;ref name=Reid /&gt;  This reorganization similarly merged the bureaus responsible for medical devices and radiation control into the [[Center for Devices and Radiological Health]].

In 1987, under Commissioner [[Frank Edward Young (physician)|Frank Young]], CBER and the [[Center for Drug Evaluation and Research]] (CDER) were split into their present form.&lt;ref name=Reid /&gt;  The two groups were charged with enforcing different laws and had significantly different philosophical and cultural differences.&lt;ref name=Reid /&gt;  CBER took a more collaborative, public-health driven approach to working with the industry, and in the 1980s was quicker to approve products than their drugs counterparts.&lt;ref name=Reid /&gt;  The growing crisis around [[HIV]] testing and treatment, and an inter-agency dispute between officials from the former Bureau of Drugs and officials from the former Bureau of Biologics over whether to approve Genentech's Activase ([[tissue plasminogen activator]]), led to the split.  CBER was declared the primary agency for HIV/AIDS-related products, since HIV had been spread significantly by blood transfusion and related products.&lt;ref name=Reid /&gt;

In 1997, Congress re-authorized user fees, and research previously done at taxpayer expense began to be charged to manufacturers.&lt;ref name=Reid /&gt;  CBER's research work has diminished dramatically since then.&lt;ref name=Reid /&gt;

In 2002, the FDA transferred a number of biologically produced therapeutics to CDER.&lt;ref name=Reid /&gt;  CBER regulates a number of biologics-related products, including blood tests, computer software, and devices related to blood transfusion, which industry representatives would like to see handled by the much brisker Center for Devices and Radiological Health.&lt;ref name=Reid&gt;Reid, Ken. "CBER and CDER have long history of being lumped together and split up." ''Bioresearch Monitoring Alert'' Sept. 2002. page 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9788">A '''central securities depository''' ('''CSD''') is a specialist financial organization holding [[securities]] such as [[Share (finance)|shares]] either in certificated or uncertificated ([[Dematerialization (securities)|dematerialized]]) form so that ownership can be easily transferred through a [[book entry]] rather than the transfer of physical certificates.  This allows [[brokerage firm|brokers]] and financial companies to hold their securities at one location where they can be available for [[clearing (finance)|clearing]] and [[Settlement (finance)|settlement]].  This is usually done electronically, making it much faster and easier than was traditionally the case where physical certificates had to be exchanged after a trade had been completed.

In some cases these organizations also carry out centralized comparison, and transaction processing such as clearing and settlement of securities.

== Scope ==
A CSD can be national or international in nature, and may be for a specific type of security, such as [[government bond]]s.

===Domestic central securities depository===
Many countries have one domestic CSD that was traditionally associated with the national stock exchange.  These organizations are typically heavily regulated by the government and may or may not be separate from the exchanges where trading in securities occurs.

===International central securities depository (ICSD)===
An international CSD is a central securities depository that settles trades in international securities such as [[eurobond]]s although many also settle trades in various domestic securities, usually through direct or indirect (through local agents) links to local CSDs.  Examples of international CSDs include [[Clearstream]] (previously [[Cedel]]), [[Euroclear]] and SIX SIS.  While viewed as a national CSD rather than an ICSD, the US [[Depository Trust Company|Depository Trust Company (DTC)]] does hold over $2 trillion in non-US securities and in [[American depositary receipt]]s from over 100 nations.

==Functions==
* '''Safekeeping''' Securities may be in dematerialized form, book-entry only form (with one or more "global" certificates), or in physical form immobilized within the CSD.  
* '''Deposit and withdrawal''' Supporting deposits and withdrawals involves the relationship between the transfer agent and/or issuers and the CSD.  It also covers the CSD's role within the [[underwriting]] process or listing of new issues in a market.
* '''Dividend, interest, and principal processing, as well as corporate actions including proxy voting''' Paying and transfer agents, as well as issuers are involved in these processes, depending on the level of services provided by the CSD and its relationship with these entities. 
* '''Other services''' CSDs offer additional services aside from those considered core services.  These services include  securities [[lending]] and borrowing, matching, and [[repurchase agreement|repo]] settlement, or ISIN assistance.
* '''Pledge''' - Central depositories provide pledging of share and securities.  Every country is required to provide legal framework to protect the interest of the pledger and pledgee.

However, there are risks and responsibilities regarding these services that must be taken into consideration in analyzing and evaluating each market on a case-by-case basis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.exchange-handbook.co.uk/articles_story.cfm?id=38756&amp;search=1  exchange-handbook.co uk article] on the risks associated with Depositories, at the ''Handbook of world stock, derivative and commodity exchanges'' website.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Manhattan Company===
{{main|Bank of the Manhattan Company}}
Chase traces its history back to the founding of The Manhattan Company by [[Aaron Burr]] on September 1, 1799, in a house at 40 Wall Street:&lt;ref name=1799hist/&gt;

{{quote|After an epidemic of yellow fever in 1798, during which coffins had been sold by itinerant vendors on street corners, [[Aaron Burr]] established the Manhattan Company, with the ostensible aim of bringing clean water to the city from the [[Bronx River]] but in fact designed as a front for the creation of New York's second bank, rivaling [[Alexander Hamilton]]'s [[Bank of New York]].|''[[The Economist]]''&lt;ref name="economist"&gt;{{cite news| title=Soaking the poor| url=http://www.economist.com/node/330993| work=[[The Economist]]| first=Gerard T.| last=Koppell| date=March 16, 2000| accessdate=October 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 2006, the modern-day Chase bought the [[retail banking]] division of the Bank of New York, which then only months later merged with [[Pittsburgh]]-based [[Mellon Financial]] to form the present-day [[The Bank of New York Mellon|BNY Mellon]].

===Chase National Bank===
Chase National Bank was formed in 1877 by [[John Thompson (banker)|John Thompson]].&lt;ref name=1799hist/&gt; It was named after former [[United States Treasury Secretary]] and Chief Justice [[Salmon P. Chase]],&lt;ref name=history/&gt; although Chase did not have a connection with the bank.&lt;ref name=1799hist/&gt;

The Chase National Bank acquired a number of smaller banks in the 1920s, through its Chase Securities Corporation. In 1926, for instance, it acquired [[Mechanics and Metals National Bank]]. [[File:The Chase National Bank of the City of New York, Specimen Stock Certificate.jpg|thumb|Specimen Stock Certificate]]

However, its most significant acquisition was the Equitable Trust Company of New York in 1930, the largest stockholder of which was [[John D. Rockefeller, Jr.]]&lt;ref name="memoirs"&gt;{{cite book| title=David Rockefeller: Memoirs| first=David| last=Rockefeller| place=New York| publisher=Random House| date=October 15, 2002| isbn=978-0-679-40588-7| pages=124–25}}&lt;/ref&gt; This made Chase the largest bank in America and indeed, in the world.

Chase was primarily a [[wholesale banking|wholesale bank]], dealing with other prominent financial institutions and major corporate clients, such as [[General Electric]], which had, through its [[RCA]] subsidiary, leased prominent space and become a crucial first tenant of [[Rockefeller Center]], rescuing that major project in 1930. The bank is also closely associated with and has financed the [[oil industry]], having longstanding connections with its board of directors to the successor companies of [[Standard Oil]], especially [[ExxonMobil]], which are also Rockefeller holdings.

[[Image:Chase 1962 logo.png|thumb|200px|The 1960–1976 logo]]
In 1955, Chase National Bank and The Manhattan Company merged to create The Chase Manhattan Bank.&lt;ref name=1799hist/&gt; As Chase was a much larger bank, it was first intended that Chase acquire the "Bank of Manhattan", as it was nicknamed, but it transpired that Burr's original charter for the Manhattan Company had not only included the clause allowing it to start a bank with surplus funds, but another requiring unanimous consent of shareholders for the bank to be taken over. The deal was therefore structured as an acquisition by the Bank of the Manhattan Company of Chase National, with [[John J. McCloy]] becoming chairman of the merged entity. This avoided the need for unanimous consent by shareholders.

For Chase Manhattan Bank's new logo, [[Chermayeff &amp; Geismar]] designed a stylized octagon in 1961, which remains part of the bank's logo today.&lt;ref name="Chermayeff"&gt;{{cite web| title=Chase Manhattan Bank| url=http://cgstudionyc.com/identities/chase| publisher=Chermayeff &amp; Geismar| accessdate=October 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Chase logo is a stylized representation of the primitive water pipes laid by the Manhattan Company, which were made by nailing together wooden planks.&lt;ref name="tett"&gt;{{cite book| last=Tett| first=Gillian| authorlink=Gillian Tett| title=Fool's Gold: How the Bold Dream of a Small Tribe at J.P.

Under McCloy's successor, George Champion, the bank relinquished its antiquated 1799 state charter for a modern one. In 1969, under the leadership of [[David Rockefeller]], the bank became part of a [[bank holding company]], the [[Chase Manhattan Corporation]].&lt;ref name=history/&gt;

===Mergers with Chemical, J.P. Morgan===
[[Image:Chase logo pre merger.png|thumb|The 1976–2007 logo]]

In July 1996, [[Chemical Bank]] of New York purchased Chase Manhattan Bank.  Chemical's previous acquisitions included  [[Manufacturers Hanover Corporation]], in 1991, and [[Texas Commerce Bank]], in 1987. Although Chemical was the nominal survivor, the merged company retained the Chase name since it was better known (particularly outside the United States).

In December 2000, the combined Chase Manhattan completed the acquisition of [[J.P. Morgan &amp; Co.]] in one of the largest banking mergers to date. The combined company was renamed [[JPMorgan Chase]]. In 2004, the bank acquired [[Bank One]], making Chase the largest credit card issuer in the United States. JPMorgan Chase added [[Bear Stearns &amp; Co.]] and [[Washington Mutual]] to its acquisitions in 2008 and 2009 respectively. After closing nearly 400 overlapping branches of the combined company, less than 10% of its total, Chase will have approximately 5,410 branches in 23 states as of the closing date of the acquisition.&lt;ref name="bloomberg"&gt;{{cite news|title=WaMu lists debt of $8B in bankruptcy |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=a_WW5ZH_P_A0&amp;refer=home |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120412064207/http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=a_WW5ZH_P_A0&amp;refer=home |archivedate=April 12, 2012 |work=[[Bloomberg News]] |date=September 27, 2008 |first1=Jef |last1=Feeley |first2=Steven |last2=Church |accessdate=October 14, 2011 |publisher=Bloomberg |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="expect"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/headline/biz/6026107.html| title=Q&amp;A What former WaMu customers can expect| work=[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]| date=September 26, 2008| via=[[Houston Chronicle]]| accessdate=October 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to data from SNL Financial (data as of June 30, 2008), this places Chase third behind [[Wells Fargo]] and [[Bank of America]] in terms of total U.S. retail bank branches. In October 2010, Chase was named in two lawsuits alleging manipulation of the silver market.&lt;ref name="benoit"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.marketwatch.com/story/jp-morgan-hsbc-sued-for-silver-manipulation-2010-10-27| title=J.P.

===Bank One Corporation===
{{Main|Bank One Corporation}}

In 2004, JPMorgan Chase merged with [[Chicago]]-based [[Bank One Corporation|Bank One Corp.]], bringing on board its current chairman and [[CEO]] [[Jamie Dimon]] as president and [[Chief operating officer|COO]] and designating him as CEO [[William B. Harrison, Jr.]]'s successor.  Dimon's pay was pegged at 90% of Harrison's. Dimon quickly made his influence felt by embarking on a cost-cutting strategy and replaced former JPMorgan Chase executives in key positions with Bank One executives—many of whom were with Dimon at [[Citigroup]].  Dimon became CEO in January 2006 and Chairman in December 2006 after Harrison's resignation.

[[Bank One Corporation]] was formed upon the 1998 merger between Banc One of [[Columbus, Ohio]] and [[First Chicago Bank|First Chicago NBD]]. These two large banking companies were themselves created through the merger of many banks. JPMorgan Chase completed the acquisition of [[Bank One]] in Q3 2004. The merger between Bank One and JPMorgan Chase meant that corporate headquarters were now in New York City while the retail bank operations of Chase were consolidated in New York.&lt;ref name="merger"&gt;{{cite press release|title=JPMorgan Chase, Bank One complete merger| date=July 1, 2004| publisher=JPMorgan Chase| url=http://investor.shareholder.com/jpmorganchase/releasedetail.cfm?releaseid=144508| accessdate=October 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=October 2015}}

===Washington Mutual===
{{Main|Washington Mutual}}
On September 25, 2008, JPMorgan Chase bought most banking operations of Washington Mutual from the [[receivership]] of the [[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation]] (FDIC). That night, the [[Office of Thrift Supervision]], in what was by far the largest bank failure in American history, seized Washington Mutual Bank and placed it into receivership. The FDIC sold the bank's assets, secured debt obligations and deposits to JPMorgan Chase Bank, NA for $1.888 billion, which re-opened the bank the following day.  As a result of the takeover, Washington Mutual shareholders lost all their [[Equity investment|equity]].&lt;ref name="Ellis"&gt;{{cite news| first1=David| last1=Ellis| first2=Jeanne| last2=Sahadi| url=http://money.cnn.com/2008/09/25/news/companies/JPM_WaMu/index.htm?postversion=2008092519| title=JPMorgan buys WaMu| publisher=CNN| date=September 25, 2008| accessdate=October 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the acquisition, JPMorgan became owner of the former accounts of [[Providian Financial]], a credit card issuer WaMu acquired in 2005. The company completed the rebranding of Washington Mutual branches to Chase in late 2009.

===Other recent acquisitions===
In the first-quarter of 2006, Chase purchased [[Collegiate Funding Services]], a portfolio company of private equity firm [[Lightyear Capital]], for $663 million.  CFS was used as the foundation for the Chase Student Loans, previously known as Chase Education Finance.&lt;ref name="Collegiate"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20051215005717/en/Chase-Acquire-Collegiate-Funding-Services| title=Chase to Acquire Collegiate Funding Services| publisher=Business Wire| date=December 15, 2005| accessdate=October 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April of that same year (2006), Chase acquired the [[Bank of New York Mellon|Bank of New York Co.]]'s retail and small business banking network. This gave Chase access to 338 additional branches and 700,000 new customers in New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, and Indiana.

==Controversies==

===Purchase of Nazi Germany's Reichsmarks during WWII===
A press release from the [[National Archives and Records Administration]] (NARA) in 2004 announced that many of the new [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) files had become declassified.  This declassification enabled the discovery that before and during the early years of [[World War II]], the [[Nazi Germany|German government]] sold a special kind of [[Reichsmark]], known as Rückwanderer [returnee] Marks, to American citizens of German descent.  Chase National Bank, along with other businesses, were involved in these transactions.  Through Chase, this allowed Nazi sympathizers to purchase Marks with [[American dollar|dollars]] at a discounted rate. Specifically, "The financial houses understood that the German government paid the commissions (to its agents, including Chase) through the sale of discounted, blocked Marks that came mainly from [[Jews]] who had fled [[Germany]]."  In other words, Nazi Germany was able to offer these Marks below face-value because they had been stolen from [[emigré]]s fleeing the Nazi regime.  Between 1936 and 1941, the [[Nazi Party|Nazis]] amassed over $20 million, and the businesses enabling these transactions earned $1.2 million in commissions.  Of these commissions, over $500,000 went to Chase National Bank and its subagents.

These facts were discovered when the FBI began its investigation in October 1940.  The purpose of the investigation was to follow German-Americans who had bought the Marks.  However, Chase National Bank's executives were never federally prosecuted because Chase's lead attorney threatened to reveal [[FBI]], [[United States Army|Army]], and [[United States Navy|Navy]] "sources and methods" in court (needs reference).  Publicly naming the sources and methods could have posed security risks and threatened future [[intelligence gathering]]. To avoid such revelations, the executives' violations of the [[Johnson Act]], the [[Espionage Act]], and the [[Foreign Agents Registration Act]] were never prosecuted.&lt;ref name="opened"&gt;{{cite press release| publisher=[[National Archives and Records Administration]]| title=Thousands of Intelligence Documents Opened under the Nazi War Crimes Disclosure Act| date=May 13, 2004| accessdate=September 13, 2012| url=https://www.archives.gov/press/press-releases/2004/nr04-55.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="goda"&gt;{{cite book| first2=Norman| last2=Goda| first3=Timothy| last3=Naftali| first4=Robert| last4=Wolfe| last1=Breitman| first1=Richard| chapter=Banking on Hitler: Chase National Bank and the Rückwanderer Mark Scheme, 1936–1941| title=U.S. Intelligence and the Nazis| publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]| date=April 4, 2005| pages=173–202| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GnkBYN8ipYcC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=es&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false| isbn=978-0521617949| accessdate=September 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hydra"&gt;{{cite book| last2=Hawkins| first2=John| title=The Nazi Hydra in America: Suppressed History of a Century| first1=Glen| last1=Yeadon| publisher=Progressive Press| date=June 1, 2008| location=Joshua Tree, California| page=195| accessdate=September 13, 2013| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vh7sx2xtjGEC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q=chase%20bank&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Release of funds for Nazi Germany during WWII===
Besides the controversial Rückwanderer Mark Scheme, NARA records also revealed another controversy during the [[occupation of France]] by the Nazis.  From the late 1930s until June 14, 1941, when President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] (FDR) issued an [[Executive order (United States)|Executive Order]] freezing German assets, Chase National Bank worked with the Nazi government.  The order blocking any access to French accounts in the U.S. by anyone, but especially by the Nazis was issued by [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|Secretary of the Treasury]], [[Henry Morgenthau Jr.]], with the approval of FDR. Within hours of the order, Chase unblocked the accounts and the funds were transferred through [[South America]] to Nazi Germany.&lt;ref name=hydra /&gt;

===Refusal to release funds belonging to Jews in Occupied France===
[[US Treasury]] officials wanted an investigation of French subsidiaries of American banks, such as Chase Bank, [[J.P. Morgan &amp; Co]], [[National City Corporation]], [[Guaranty Trust Company of New York|Guaranty Bank]], [[Bankers Trust]], and [[American Express]].  Of these banks, only Chase and Morgan remained open in France during the [[Military Administration in France (Nazi Germany)|Nazi occupation]].  The Chase branch chief in Paris, France, Carlos Niedermann, told his supervisor in New York that there had been an "expansion of deposits". Also, Niedermann was, "very vigorous in enforcing restrictions against Jewish property, even going so far as to refuse to release funds belonging to Jews in anticipation that a decree with [[Ex post facto law|retroactive]] provisions prohibiting such release might be published in the near future by the occupying Nazi authorities".

In 1998, Chase general counsel William McDavid, said that Chase did not have control over Niedermann. Whether that claim was true or not, Chase Manhattan Bank acknowledged seizing about 100 accounts during the [[Vichy government|Vichy regime]].  Kenneth McCallion, an attorney, led a lawsuit against [[Barclays Bank]] for the illegal seizure of assets during WWII and has since turned his attention toward Chase.  The [[World Jewish Congress]] (WJC), entered into discussions with Chase and a spokesperson for the WJC said, "Nobody at Chase today is guilty. They were not involved in whatever happened, but they do accept that they have an institutional responsibility." A Chase spokesman said, "This is a moral issue that we take very seriously."  Chase general counsel McDavid added, "that Chase intends to compensate Jewish account holders whose assets were illegally plundered". In 1999, the French government formed a commission to report findings to [[Prime Minister of France|Prime Minister]] [[Lionel Jospin]].  Claire Andrieu, a commission member and history professor at the [[Sorbonne]], said that under the [[Vichy France|Vichy regime]], French banks received visits from Nazi officials but U.S. banks did not.  At that time, they did not have to report Jewish accounts, but they did just as the French banks did.  She goes on to say that an American [[ambassador]] protected the U.S. subsidiaries.&lt;ref name="siemaszko"&gt;{{cite news| last=Siemaszko| first=Corky| title=Chase Banked On Nazis - Report| work=[[New York Daily News]]| publisher=newsmine.org| date=December 7, 1998| url=http://newsmine.org/content.php?ol=cabal-elite/families/rockefeller/chase-rockefellers-banked-on-nazis.txt| accessdate=September 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sutton"&gt;{{cite book| last=Sutton| first=Anthony C.| chapter=Chapter Eleven: Wall Street-Nazi Collaboration in World War II| title=Wall Street And The Rise Of Hitler| publisher=Studies in Reformed Theology| year=2000| accessdate=September 13, 2013| url=http://reformed-theology.org/html/books/wall_street/chapter_11.htm| isbn=978-1568497266}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recent controversies===
JPMorgan Chase has paid $16 billion in fines, settlements and other litigation expenses from 2011 to 2013. Of the $16 billion JPMorgan Chase has paid, about $8.5 billion were for fines and settlements resulting from illegal actions taken by bank executives, according to Richard Eskow at the Campaign for America's Future, who cited a new report from Joshua Rosner of Graham Fisher &amp; Co.

The $16 billion total does not include a recent settlement that calls for JPMorgan Chase to pay $100 million to waive $417 million in claims it had made against clients of the firm [[MF Global]].

[[File:Siedlung eisenheim.jpg|thumb|280px|The town of Siedlung Eisenheim in [[Oberhausen]], Germany]] 
A '''company town''' is a place where practically all stores and housing are owned by the one company that is also the main employer. Company towns are often planned with a suite of amenities such as stores, churches, schools, markets and recreation facilities. They are usually bigger than a [[model village]] ("model" in the sense of an ideal to be emulated).

The best examples of company towns have had high ideals; but many have been regarded as controlling or exploitative.  Others developed more or less in unplanned fashion, such as [[Summit Hill, Pennsylvania]], United States, one of the oldest, which began as a [[LC&amp;N Co.]] mining camp and mine site nine miles (14.5 km) from the nearest outside road.

==Overview==

Traditional settings for company towns were where [[Resource extraction|extractive industries]] — [[History of coal miners|coal]], metal mines, [[lumberjacks|lumber]] — had established a monopoly franchise. [[Dam]] sites and war-industry camps founded other company towns. Since company stores often had a monopoly in company towns, it was possible to pay in [[scrip]] through a [[truck system]]. In the Soviet Union there were several cities of nuclear scientists (''atomics'') known as [[atomgrad]]; particularly in [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Ukraine]] those were [[Pripyat]], [[Varash]], [[Yuzhnoukrainsk]] among others.

Typically, a company town is isolated from neighbors and centered on a large production factory, such as a lumber or steel mill or an automobile plant; and the citizens of the town either work in the factory, work in one of the smaller businesses, or is a family member of someone who does. The company may also donate a church building to a local congregation, operate parks, host cultural events such as concerts, and so on. If the owning company cuts back or goes out of business, the [[economics|economic]] effect on the company town is devastating, as people move to jobs elsewhere.

Company towns often become regular public cities and towns as they grow and attract other settlement, business enterprises, and public transportation and services infrastructure. Other times, a town may not officially be a company town, but it may be a town where the majority of citizens are employed by a single company, thus creating a similar situation to a company town (especially in regard to the town's economy). Further, such dependencies extend to neighborhoods and [[urban area|regions of larger cities]]. In each case, if the primary company falls on lean times, fails outright or the industry fades in importance (as with steam locomotive support rail yards and [[anthracite]] mining industries which depended on [[steam locomotive]]s spurring demands) the communities contract and lose [[property value]] and then [[declining population|population]] as people move to find work elsewhere, and the youth of the community bears the children of their generation in another demographic region.

==History==

===Paternalism===
[[File:Bayreuthburg01.JPG|thumb|280px|Company town ''[[Burg (Bayreuth)|Burg]]'' in [[Bayreuth]], Germany]]
{{main article|Welfare capitalism}}
[[Paternalism]], a subtle form of [[social engineering (political science)|social engineering]], refers to the control of workers by their employers who sought to force middle-class ideals upon their working-class employees. Paternalism was considered by many nineteenth-century businessmen as a moral responsibility, or often a religious obligation, which would advance society whilst furthering their own business interests. Accordingly, the company town offered a unique opportunity to achieve such ends.

Although many prominent examples of company towns portray their founders as "capitalists with a conscience", for example, [[George Cadbury]]'s [[Bournville]], if viewed cynically, the company town was often an economically viable ploy to attract and retain workers. Additionally, for-profit shops within company towns were usually owned by the company, which were unavoidable to its isolated workers, thus resulting in a monopoly for the owners.&lt;ref name="Crawford"&gt;Crawford&lt;/ref&gt;

Although economically successful, company towns sometimes failed politically due to a lack of elected officials and municipally owned services.&lt;ref name="Garner"&gt;Garner, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, workers often had no say in local affairs and therefore, felt dictated to. Ultimately, this political climate caused resentment amongst workers and resulted in many residents eventually losing long-term affection for their towns; such was the case at Pullman.

===Pullman lesson===
Although many small company towns existed in mining areas of [[Pennsylvania]] before the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], one of the largest, and most substantial early company towns in the United States was [[Pullman, Chicago|Pullman]], developed in the 1880s just outside the [[Chicago]] city limits. The town, entirely company-owned, provided housing, markets, a library, churches and entertainment for the 6,000 company employees and an equal number of dependents. Employees were required to live in Pullman, although cheaper rentals could be found in nearby communities.

The town operated successfully until the economic [[panic of 1893]], when demand for the company's products declined, and employee wages had to be lowered accordingly. Despite this, the company refused to lower rents in the town or the price of goods at its shops, thus resulting in the [[Pullman Strike]] of 1894. A national commission formed to investigate the causes of the strikes found that Pullman's paternalism was partly to blame and labelled it "un-American".&lt;ref&gt;Stanley Buder, ''Pullman: An Experiment in Industrial Order and Community Planning, 1880–1930''&lt;/ref&gt; The report condemned Pullman for refusing to negotiate and for the economic hardships he created for workers in the town of Pullman. "The aesthetic features are admired by visitors, but have little money value to employees, especially when they lack bread." The State of Illinois filed suit, and in 1898 the [[Supreme Court of Illinois]] forced the Pullman Company to divest ownership in the town, which was annexed to Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/chicago/peopleevents/p_pullman.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Archaeology&gt;{{cite journal|author=Arthur Melville Pearson |date=January–February 2009|title=Utopia Derailed|journal=Archaeology|volume=62|issue=1|pages=46–49|issn=0003-8113 |url=http://www.archaeology.org/0901/abstracts/pullman.html|accessdate=2010-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, government observers maintained that Pullman's principles were accurate, in that he provided his employees with a [[quality of life]] otherwise unattainable to them, but recognised that his excessive paternalism was inappropriate for a large-scale corporate economy and thus caused the town's downfall. Accordingly, government observers and social reformers alike saw the need for a balance between control and well-designed towns, concluding that a model company town would only succeed if independent professionals, acting as a buffer between employers and employees, took a role in conception, planning, and management of these towns.&lt;ref&gt;Fogelsong, R. 1986. ‘Planning the Capitalist City’. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press. {{ISBN|0691077053}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian Linda Carlson argues that the managers of corporate towns in the early 20th century believed they could avoid the mistakes made by George Pullman in the 1880s. She says they:
:wanted to create a better life for their employees: decent housing, good schools, and a "morally uplifting" society.  In return, they expected stable, hard-working employees who would eschew the evils of drink and, most important, not fall prey to the blandishments of union organizers.&lt;ref&gt;Linda Carlson, ''Company towns of the Pacific Northwest'' (U. of Washington Press, 2014)  p. 190.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, the Pullman Strike did not kill the concept of a company town but rather initiated a new chapter in their existence. Over the next thirty years, the old model of paternalism was abandoned in favour of new professionally designed company towns with architects, landscape architects, and planners translating "new concepts of industrial relations and social welfare into new physical forms". This suited capitalists of the day who were obviously keen to avoid the experiences of Pullman. The first real example of this occurred at [[Indian Hill-North Village, Massachusetts]], in 1915.&lt;ref&gt;Crawford, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;

===Decline of American company towns===

By the 1920s, the need for company towns had declined significantly due to increased national affluence. Despite income inequalities and a relatively low standard of living conditions amongst factory laborers, the prosperity of the 1920s saw workers’ material well-being improve significantly. A strong post-war American economy meant installment buying was accessible to low-wage earners who could now purchase previously unattainable goods like automobiles and radios. Moreover, workers were no longer dependent on employers for healthcare and education.

By the 1920s the widespread nature of the automobile meant workers no longer needed to live near their work places and now had access to more employment opportunities. A combination of the freedom that came with private transport and the mass communication of radio saw the isolation of company towns lessen and the social basis of the company town become less necessary.

Furthermore, the accessibility of the working class to private transport also marked a step of equality as they had previously only been accessible to the wealthy. As access to surrounding municipalities increased, residents of company towns gained access to an increasing amount of government-funded public resources such as schools, libraries, and parks. Accordingly, there was no longer a need for the amenities of company towns which, prior to [[welfare capitalism]], had previously been unattainable to the working class.&lt;ref name="Crawford" /&gt;

This new found freedom saw a change in the mindset of workers who began to look on welfare capitalism as demeaning rather than an incentive. Accordingly, many employees began to request additional pay in lieu of welfare programs. This was well received by some employers as the idea of ‘laissez-faire’ individualism, which promoted entrepreneurial virtues of hard-work being rewarded rather than direct charity, began to shape new-age paternalism.&lt;ref name="Crawford" /&gt;

Modernization and the increase in material well-being had also lessened the perceived need for paternalism and moral reform. Consequently, the economic downturn of the early 1930s saw some businesses do away with employee welfare schemes to reduce costs. However, the Roosevelt Administration’s [[New Deal]] dealt the final blow to end American company towns by raising minimum wages, encouraging industrial self-governance, and pushing for the owners of company towns to “consider the question of plans for eventual employee ownership of homes”.&lt;ref&gt;Crawford, p. 204&lt;/ref&gt; To a lesser extent the New Deal also reduced the need for employee housing by transforming housing finance to a lower-interest, lower-deposit system making home ownership more accessible to the working class.

==Model company towns==
[[File:Port Sunlight.jpg|thumb|An example of houses at [[Port Sunlight]]]]
{{see also|Model village}}
During the late nineteenth century, model company towns materialised, as enlightened industrialists recognised that many poor workers were living in appalling conditions.&lt;ref name=parsons/&gt; These industrialists wished to combat the unsanitary and congested conditions common to working class districts in order to create better living conditions for workers.&lt;ref name="Garner_b"&gt;Garner, 1982, p. xi&lt;/ref&gt; Model company towns such as [[Port Sunlight]] (1888) and [[Bournville]] (1895) were influential in regards to their building and planning innovation. The ideas generated from these model towns are regarded as having a significant influence on the [[Garden city movement|Garden City movement]].&lt;ref name="Garner" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Jackson"&gt;Jackson&lt;/ref&gt;

The model company town is concerned with creating a productive and prosperous company. Enlightened industrialists believed this could be achieved by providing a healthier residential environment for their employees. Planning a model company town involved the fusion of new notions of house design and layout.&lt;ref&gt;Gaskell, p. 440&lt;/ref&gt; The paternalism of the enlightened industrialist was exhibited in his desire to provide an environment for his employees that was aesthetically appealing and which included well-designed residences, parks, schools, libraries and meeting halls.&lt;ref name="Garner_a"&gt;Garner, 1992, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; The industrialist also wished to contribute to his workers' well-being by providing social programs such as sporting events and functions.&lt;ref name="Garner_a" /&gt; This, however, highlights the power and immense control possessed by the company owner, who could shape the lifestyle and activities of his employees to serve his own interests and those of the company.&lt;ref name="Garner_b" /&gt;

Model villages for agricultural workers were founded in the early 19th century in the United Kingdom. The creation of model company towns was particularly evident in Britain during the latter half of the nineteenth century with the creation of [[Saltaire]] (1851), [[Bournville]], [[Port Sunlight]], [[Creswell, Derbyshire|Creswell]] and [[New Earswick]] (1901) and coincided with the housing-reform movement, which emphasized the improvement of housing for the working class.&lt;ref name=parsons/&gt; These model towns contrasted with the overcrowded conditions in British working-class districts, which were often characterized by congested housing, unsanitary conditions, and poor provision of open space and facilities.&lt;ref&gt;Gaskell&lt;/ref&gt; Model company towns promoted the idea of orderly, planned town development as well as the notion of planning for the needs of the community in order to provide healthier living conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Cherry&lt;/ref&gt;

===Model company towns in Britain===
Model company towns around the mid-nineteenth century, such as Copley (1849), near Halifax, and Saltaire (1853), close to Bradford, were differentiated by improved dwellings for workers which contrasted with working-class housing in other industrial villages and cities.&lt;ref&gt;Garner, 1982, p. 87&lt;/ref&gt; These model company towns prompted the creation of others, such as Port Sunlight, Bournville and Creswell, within an environment of reform.&lt;ref&gt;Garner, 1982&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Port Sunlight]] (1888) in Cheshire was established by William Hesketh Lever (later Lord Leverhulme) of Lever Brothers – a soap and tallow manufacturer. The earlier layout of this model company town was planned to suit the undulating topography of the site.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt; Port Sunlight catered for the Lever Brothers employees through the provision of improved housing (cottages of varying designs and materials) and gardens, as well as social and community facilities, including an auditorium, a school, tennis courts and bowling greens.&lt;ref name="Jackson" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cherry"&gt;Cherry, p. 314&lt;/ref&gt; Port Sunlight combined the use of formal and informal planning elements, such as straight streets close to the town centre and curved streets in the residential areas. This combination of the formal and informal represented a new feature of British town planning.&lt;ref&gt;Hebblethwaite, p. 155&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bournville]] (1895), near Birmingham, was established by the Cadbury brothers, George and Richard.&lt;ref&gt;Dellheim&lt;/ref&gt; George and Richard Cadbury chose to transfer the Cadbury factory to this new site in order to provide their employees with improved living conditions and a country environment that they could enjoy – a far cry from the busy, smoky city centre of Birmingham.&lt;ref&gt;Dellheim, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; The firm provided education in the form of a compulsory academic course, and workers were given the opportunity to complete commercial or technical training.&lt;ref name="Dellheim"&gt;Dellheim, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; The Cadburys also encouraged their workers to get involved in the social life of Bournville through the provision of sports facilities and athletic and cultural clubs, as well as social events such as summer parties.&lt;ref name="Dellheim" /&gt; [[George Cadbury]], a Quaker, preached Christian values, such as respectability, thrift and sobriety, and sought to unify the Bournville community through rituals such as gift giving between employer and employee.&lt;ref&gt;Dellheim, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; The firm also established work councils, such as the Women's Works Council, and supported trades unions.&lt;ref&gt;Dellheim, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt;

Bournville represented the union of industry and nature as the company town boasted the attractiveness of the countryside and low-density development defined by well-built and visually appealing dwellings.&lt;ref name="Cherry" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dellheim, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike Port Sunlight, Bournville catered for a mixed community, where residences were not restricted to the workforce only.&lt;ref name="Jackson_a"&gt;Jackson, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; Bournville illustrated how, towards the end of the nineteenth century, low-density development was being punctuated along with the provision of open air, space and sunlight.&lt;ref&gt;Cherry, p. 317&lt;/ref&gt; Bournville's gardens, parks, tree-lined streets, sense of spaciousness and country setting enhanced its aesthetic appeal and demonstrated George Cadbury's endeavour to provide workers with a healthy, beautiful and well-ventilated environment.&lt;ref name="Jackson_a" /&gt;

The Bolsover Company developed two exemplary mining communities in Derbyshire during the late nineteenth century, [[Bolsover]] (1891) and [[Creswell, Derbyshire|Creswell]] (1896). The Bolsover Company aimed to provide improved living conditions for the miners and their families in these model industrial villages. The houses at Creswell were built in concentric circles, and within these circles was a large open parkland and a bandstand.&lt;ref name="Gaskell"&gt;Gaskell, p. 446&lt;/ref&gt; Not only did the Bolsover Company aim to provide better housing, but they also wished to improve workers' moral fibre, believing that the provision of facilities and the promotion of workers' welfare would discourage drunkenness, gambling and bad language. The Bolsover Company provided facilities deemed beneficial for employees at both villages including clubhouses, bowling greens, cooperative society stores, cricket pitches and schools.&lt;ref name="Gaskell" /&gt; During the early years of these model industrial villages, the Bolsover Company organized various events intended to enhance community life, such as flower shows, lectures, sporting events, concerts, teas and dances.&lt;ref&gt;Gaskell, p. 447&lt;/ref&gt;

==Industrial colonies in Catalonia, Spain==
[[File:Colònia Pons.jpg|thumb|Cal Pons, a textile company town, or ''industrial colony'', in [[Puig-reig]]]]
[[Catalonia]], a region located in North-Eastern Spain, has a high density of company towns, known locally as industrial colonies. They are especially concentrated in river basins along the [[Ter River|Ter]] and [[Llobregat]]. In [[Berguedà]], for example, within 20&amp;nbsp;km there are 14 colonies. The total number in Catalonia is around a hundred. These were small towns created around a factory, built in a rural area and, therefore, separate from any other population. They housed between 100 and 500 inhabitants, and in some cases around 1000 people.&lt;ref name="Serra"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Serra|first1=Rosa|title=Industrial colonies in Catalonia|journal=Catalan Historical Review|date=2011|volume=4|pages=101–120|doi=10.2436/20.1000.01.53|url=http://revistes.iec.cat/index.php/CHR/article/viewFile/54342/pdf_159|accessdate=27 April 2016|issn=2013-407X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These industrial colonies were a typical aspect of industrialization in Catalonia, specifically the second industrialization, which resulted in certain areas that were once purely rural becoming industrial. They were first created in the second half of the nineteenth century, especially from the 1870s onwards. The last colonies were created in the early years of the twentieth century. Thus, company towns in Catalonia have a history going back some 150 years, although in almost all cases the company that operated the colony has now shut down. The most common industry in these colonies was textiles. There are more than 75 textile colonies recorded; although there were also mining, metallurgy and agricultural colonies.&lt;ref name="Serra" /&gt;

Mostly these colonies (particularly the textile related ones) were constructed close to a river. This was because they used hydraulic power (waterwheels) to run the factory. One reason for this was that Catalonia was poor in coal and importing it was expensive. In addition, the Catalan rivers (with little volume but a very steep sloping run) provided free and almost inexhaustible energy, that was lacking only in times of drought.&lt;ref name="clua"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Clua i Mercadal|first1=Jordi|title=Les colònies industrials al Berguedà: estudi d'una transformació econòmica i urbana|journal=Treballs de la Societat Catalana de Geografia|date=1992|volume=VII|pages=145–170|url=http://www.raco.cat/index.php/treballsscgeografia/article/viewFile/239840/322295|accessdate=3 May 2016|language=catalan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The industrial colonies system began to collapse in the 1960s. The colonies gradually emptied of people even before the definitive industrial crisis, which worsened in 1978. In the 1980s and 1990s almost all the factories in these industrial colonies closed. From that moment on, many colonies became towns that were now independent of the company, others were abandoned and remain without inhabitants. Other factories were leased to smaller industries or now lie empty.&lt;ref name="Serra" /&gt;

Some of the more interesting colonies include: [[Colònia Güell]], in [[Santa Coloma de Cervelló]], which contains several modernist buildings, such as the crypt church built by [[Antoni Gaudí]]; [[L'Ametlla de Merola]], [[Puig-reig]], where centenary traditional cultural activities are held, such as the representation of [[Els Pastorets]]; the three colonies of [[Castellbell i el Vilar]]: [[La Bauma]], [[El Borràs]], [[El Burés]], with buildings of architectural interest; [[Cal Rosal]], between [[Berga]], [[Avià]] and [[Olvan]], which, in 1858, was the first colony in the era of building large colonies in the Llobregat; [[Cal Vidal]], Puig-reig, which houses the Museum of the Vidal Colony, an ideal visit for anyone wishing to learn what life was like in one of these industrial experiments.

===Finland===
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2016}}
[[File:A view over Kuusankoski.JPG|thumb|Former company town Kuusankoski in Finland]]
[[Kuusankoski]] in Finland, formerly also known as "the paper capital of Finland", is a prime example of the decline many company towns have had to deal with when the company itself struggles. The town relied on three paper mills owned by [[Kymmene Corporation]] from the 1870s until 2005 when two mills, Voikkaa and Kuusaa, were shut down, leaving only the Kymi mill operating. An estimated 5% of the local population had been employed by the two closed mills and Kymmene's decision left the town in socioeconomic chaos. Kuusankoski's independent status ended in 2009 when the town was consolidated into the regional capital, Kouvola.

===Namibia===
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2016}}
The border town [[Oranjemund|Oranjemund, Namibia]] is a company town owned by [[De Beers|Namibian DeBeers (Namdeb).]] The town has a diamond mine that was established over 25 years ago and is still ongoing till this day. Residents of [[Oranjemund]] either work in the mine or for the company in offices based in the town. To enter the town, all people above 18 need permission to pass its gates and need to provide a residential, and reason for visiting. Due to this the town has no homeless people at all and can regulate people coming in and out of the town. A municipality has recently been introduced in Oranjemund and will start to fully operate in late 2016 meaning residents will soon start paying for Water and Electricity which has been a benefit to them. The town is staged and is busy readying itself to becoming open to the public.

[[Svit]] in Slovakia was founded in 1934 by business industrialist [[Jan Antonín Baťa]] in accordance with his policy of establishing well-organized model communities for his workers and other employees. This town (like other Baťa´s company towns) was also an example of [[social engineering (political science)|social engineering]].

===Sweden===

The mining city of [[Kiruna]] in Sweden was originally, around 1900, built by the mining company in an unpopulated area. Everything, including the church, was built by the company.

===Ukraine===
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2016}}
The city of [[Pripyat]] in [[Ukraine]] was established in 1970 solely to house the workers at the adjacent [[Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant]] and their families. It was one of several "[[closed city|nuclear cities"]] constructed by Soviet nuclear power firms throughout the latter half of the 20th century. All amenities, stores, and employment was conducted through each nuclear city's power plant administration.

===United States===
[[File:Coalwood Company Store.jpg|thumb|right|[[Coalwood, West Virginia]] is a company town as portrayed in the movie ''[[October Sky]]''.]]
At their peak there were more than 2,500 company towns, housing 3% of the US population. The companies that ran the towns were primarily labor companies such as coal, steel, lumber and various war industries. Most of the people living in these towns were immigrants new to the country. This could cause issues among the populace since the manager of the town would be in charge of establishing the town's religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Monuments to power|url=http://www.economist.com/node/17249000?story_id=17249000&amp;fsrc=rss|quote=At their height there were more than 2,500 such towns housing 3% of the population.|work=[[The Economist]]|accessdate= 2010-10-19|date=2010-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hardy Green, ''The Company Town: The Industrial Edens and Satanic Mills That Shaped the American Economy'' (2010) [https://www.amazon.com/Company-Town-Industrial-Satanic-American/dp/B004NSVFR2/  excerpt and text search]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Segundo, Colorado]], was a company town where the [[Colorado Fuel and Iron|CF&amp;I]] coal company housed its workers. It offered adequate housing and promoted upward mobility through its sponsorship of a YMCA Center, an elementary school, and some small businesses, as well as a [[company store]].  However, air pollution was a constant health threat, also the houses lacked indoor plumbing. As demand for metallurgical coke declined, the mine laid off workers, and Segundo's population declined.  After a major fire in 1929, CF&amp;I left town, and Segundo became practically a ghost town.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Weaver Glen D., Graham Ryan C. | year = 2008 | title = Segundo, Colorado | url = | journal = New Mexico Historical Review | volume = 83 | issue = 3| pages = 323–351 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One famous company town was [[McDonald, Ohio]], which was created by the [[Carnegie Steel Company]] to house and serve the needs of its employees in the [[Youngstown, Ohio]], area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=It Was a Company Town.

[[Marktown]], [[Clayton Mark]]'s planned worker community, was an example in northwest Indiana.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, S. &amp; Mark, S. (2011).

South Shore Journal, 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the present-day United States, it is relatively rare for any place in which a single company owns all the property to be granted status as an [[incorporation (municipal government)|incorporated]] [[municipality]]. Rather, companies will normally prefer their wholly owned communities to remain unincorporated, as this permits administration of the community to be carried out by appointed company officers rather than elected officials. However, there are incorporated municipalities that are heavily dependent upon a single industry or organization and may be loosely considered a "company town", even though the company does not technically own the town.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26187">'''Consumer neuroscience''' is the combination of [[consumer research]] with modern [[neuroscience]].  The goal of the field is to find neural explanations for consumer [[behavior]]s in individuals both with or without disease.

==Consumer research==
[[Consumer research]] has existed for more than a century and has been well established as a combination of [[sociology]], [[psychology]], and [[anthropology]], and popular topics in the field revolve around consumer decision-making, [[advertising]], and [[brand management|branding]].  For decades, however, consumer researchers had never been able to directly record the internal mental processes that govern consumer behavior; they always were limited to designing experiments in which they alter the external conditions in order to view the ways in which changing variables may affect consumer behavior (examples include changing the packaging or changing a subject’s mood).  With the integration of [[neuroscience]] with consumer research, it is possible to go directly into the brain to discover the neural explanations for consumer behavior.  The ability to record brain activity with electrodes and advances in neural imaging technology make it possible to determine specific regions of the brain that are responsible for critical behaviors involved in consumption.&lt;ref name ="review"&gt;Kenning PH, Plassmann H. How Neuroscience Can Inform Consumer Research. IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering. Dec 2008;16(6):532-538.&lt;/ref&gt;

Consumer neuroscience is similar to [[neuroeconomics]] and [[neuromarketing]], but subtle, yet distinct differences exist between them.  Neuroeconomics is more of an academic field while neuromarketing and consumer neuroscience are more of an applied science.  Neuromarketing focuses on the study of various marketing techniques and attempts to integrate neuroscience knowledge to help improve the efficiency and effectiveness of said marketing strategies.  Consumer neuroscience is unique among the three because the main focus is on the consumer and how various factors affect individual preferences and purchasing behavior.

== Advertising ==

=== Advertising and emotion ===
Studies of emotion are crucial to advertising research as it has been shown that emotion plays a significant role in ad memorization.&lt;ref&gt;Ambler T, Ioannides A, Rose S, [https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Tim_Ambler/publication/227582799_Brands_on_the_Brain_Neuro-Images_of_Advertising/links/59e5c021458515250250a263/Brands-on-the-Brain-Neuro-Images-of-Advertising.pdf Brands on the brain: Neuroimages of advertising].

Dec 2008;3(4):353-366.&lt;/ref&gt;  Classically in advertising research, the theory has been that emotion and ratio are represented in different regions of the brain,&lt;ref name="Delgado"/&gt; but neuroscience may be able to disprove this theory by showing that the [[ventromedial prefrontal cortex]] and the [[striatum]] play a role in bilateral emotion processing.&lt;ref name="Ochsner"&gt;Ochsner KN, Gross JJ. [https://tu-dresden.de/mn/psychologie/allgpsy/ressourcen/dateien/lehre/pruefungsliteratur_KN_2013/Ochsner-Gross-2005.pdf The cognitive control of emotion]. Trends in Cognitive Sciences. May 2005;9(5):242-249.&lt;/ref&gt;

The attractiveness of the advertisements correlates with specific changes in brain activity in various brain regions including the [[medial prefrontal cortex]], [[posterior cingulate]], [[nucleus accumbens]] and higher-order visual cortices.&lt;ref name="Kenning"&gt;Kenning P, Plassmann H, Pieper A, Schwindt W, Kugel H  Deppe M. Neural correlates of attractive ads. Working paper. 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  This may represent an interaction between the perceived attractiveness of the ad by the consumer and the emotions expressed by the people pictured in the advertisement.&lt;ref name="Plassman"&gt;Plassmann H, Ambler T, Braeutigam S, Kenning P. [http://faculty.insead.edu/hilke-plassmann/documents/6_Plassman_etal_IJA_2007.pdf What can advertisers learn from neuroscience?] International Journal of Advertising. 2007;26(2):151-175.&lt;/ref&gt;  It has been suggested that ads that use people with positive emotions are perceived as attractive while ads using exclusively text or depicting people with neutral expressions may generally be viewed as unattractive.&lt;ref name="Plassman"/&gt;  Unattractive ads activate the anterior insula, which plays a role in the processing of negative emotions.&lt;ref&gt;Greene J, Sommerville R, Nystrom L, Darley J, Cohen J. [http://nwkpsych.rutgers.edu/~kharber/gradseminar/readings/class%204%20readings/Science%202001%20Greene.pdf An fMRI investigation of emotional engagement in moral judgment]. Science, 2001;293(5537): 2105–2108.&lt;/ref&gt;  Both attractive and unattractive ads have been shown to be more memorable than ads described as ambiguously attractive,&lt;ref name="Kenning"/&gt; but more research is needed to determine how this translates to the overall brand perception in the eyes of the consumer and how this may impact future purchasing behavior.&lt;ref name="Plassman"/&gt;

===Mental processing of advertisements===
There are various studies that have been conducted to research the question of how [[consumer]]s process and store the information presented in [[advertisements]].  [[Television commercials]] with scene durations lasting longer than 1.5 seconds have been shown to be more memorable one week later than scenes that last less than 1.5 seconds, and scenes that produce the quickest electrical response in the [[left hemisphere|left frontal hemisphere]] have been shown to be more memorable as well.  It has been suggested that the transfer of visual advertising inputs from [[short term memory]] to [[long term memory]] may take place in the [[left hemisphere]], and highly memorable ads can be created by producing the fastest responses in the [[left hemisphere]].&lt;ref&gt;Rossiter JR, Silberstein RB. [https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Richard_Silberstein/publication/285745057_Brain-Imaging_Detection_of_Visual_Scene_Encoding_in_Long-term_Memory_for_TV_Commercials/links/58b0e4de45851503be97f601/Brain-Imaging-Detection-of-Visual-Scene-Encoding-in-Long-term-Memory-for-TV-Commercials.pdf Brain-imaging detection of visual scene encoding in long-term memory for TV commercials]. Journal of Advertising Research. Mar-Apr 2001;41(2):13-21.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, these theories have been renounced by some who believe that the research findings may be attributed to extraneous and unmeasured factors.&lt;ref&gt;Crites Jr S, Aikman-Eckenrode S. Making inferences concerning physiological responses: a reply to Rossiter, Silberstein, Harris and Nield. Journal of Advertising Research. 2001;41(2);23–26.&lt;/ref&gt;  There is also evidence to suggest that a front to back difference in processing speed may be more influential on ad memorization than left to right differences.&lt;ref&gt;Kemp A, Gray M, Eide P, Silberstein R, Nathan P. Steady-state visually evoked potential topography during processing of emotional valence in healthy subjects. Neuroimage. Dec 2002;17(4):1684–1692.&lt;/ref&gt;

Research has shown that there are certain periods of commercials that are far more significant for the consumer in terms of establishing advertising effects.  These short segments are referred to as “branding moments” and are thought to be the most engaging parts of the commercial.  These moments can be identified using an [[EEG]] and analyzing [[alpha waves]] (8–13&amp;nbsp;Hz), [[beta wave]]s (13–30&amp;nbsp;Hz) and [[theta waves]] (4–7&amp;nbsp;Hz).&lt;ref&gt;Young C. Brain waves, picture sorts, and branding moments. Journal of Advertising Research. July 2002; 42(4):42–53.&lt;/ref&gt;  These results may suggest that the strength of a commercial with regard to its effect on the consumer can be evaluated by the strength of its unique branding moments.

=== Affective vs. cognitive ads===
[[Affective]] advertising (using [[comedy]], [[drama]], [[suspense]], etc.) activates the [[amygdala]], the [[orbitofrontal cortex|orbitofrontal cortices]], and the [[brainstem]] whereas cognitive advertising (strict [[fact]]s) mainly activates the [[posterior parietal cortex]] and the [[prefrontal cortex|superior prefrontal cortices]].&lt;ref&gt;Ioannides A, Liu L, Theofilou D, Dammers J, Burne T, Ambler T, Rose S.

Brain Topography. 2000; 13(1):11–19.&lt;/ref&gt;  Ambler and Burne in 1999 created the Memory-Affect-Cognition (MAC) theory to explain the processes involved in [[decision making]].  According to the theory, the majority of decisions are habitual and do not require [[Affect (psychology)|affect]] or [[cognition]]; they require [[memory]] only.&lt;ref name="Ambler1999"&gt;Ambler T, Burne T. The impact of affect on the memory of advertising. Journal of Advertising Research. 1999;39(2):25–34.&lt;/ref&gt;  Most of the remaining decisions only require [[memory]] and affect; they do not require [[cognition]].&lt;ref&gt;Shapiro Y. Descartes' error: Emotion, reason, and the human brain - Damasio, AT. Theory &amp; Psychology. Dec 1997;7(6):837-856.&lt;/ref&gt;  The main use for [[cognition]] is in the form of [[Rationalization (making excuses)|rationalization]] following a particular action, however, there are occasional instances in which [[memory]], affect and [[cognition]] are all used in conjunction, such as during a debate about a particular choice.&lt;ref name="Ambler1999"/&gt;  The above findings suggest a correlation exists between ad memorization and the degree of affective content within the advertisement, but it is still unclear how this translates to brand memory.&lt;ref name="Plassman"/&gt;

== Branding ==

=== Brand associations ===
Much of [[consumer research]] is devoted to studying the effect of [[brand]] associations on consumer preferences and how they manifest into brand memories.  Brand memories can be defined as “everything that exists in the minds of customers with respect to a brand (e.g. thoughts, feelings, experiences, images, perceptions, beliefs and attitudes)”.&lt;ref&gt;Keller K, Lehmann D. How do brands create value? Marketing Management Aug 2003: 15–19.&lt;/ref&gt; Several studies have indicated there is not a designated area of the brain devoted to brand recognition.&lt;ref name="review"/&gt;  Studies have shown that different areas of the [[brain]] are activated when exposed to a [[brand]] as opposed to a person, and decisions regarding the evaluation of brands in different product categories activate the area of the brain responsible for [[semantics|semantic object]] processing rather than areas involved with the judgment of people.&lt;ref&gt;Yoon C, Gutchess AH, Feinberg F, Polk TA. [http://webuser.bus.umich.edu/feinf/research/published/yoon,_gutchess,_feinberg,_polk_(2006)_-_fmri_neural_dissociations_brand_and_person_judgments.pdf A functional magnetic resonance imaging study of neural dissociations between brand and person judgments]. Journal of Consumer Research. Jun 2006;33(1):31-40.&lt;/ref&gt;  These two findings suggest that [[brands]] are not processed by the [[brain]] in the same manner as human personalities, indicating that [[personality theory]] cannot be used to explain brand preferences.&lt;ref name="Plassman"/&gt;

=== Consumer neuroscience explains brand loyalty ===
In a study of [[fMRI]] scans of loyal and less loyal customers it was found that in the case of loyal customers the presence of a particular [[brand]] serves as a reward during choice tasks, but less loyal customers do not exhibit the same reward pathway.  It was also found that loyal customers had greater activation in the [[brain]] areas concerned with [[emotion]] and [[memory retrieval]] suggesting that loyal customers develop an [[affective]] bond with a particular brand, which serves as the primary motivation for repeat purchases.&lt;ref name="Plassman"/&gt;

Brand loyalty has been shown to be the result of changes in [[neural]] activity in the [[striatum]], which is part of the [[reward system|human action reward system]].&lt;ref&gt;Plassmann H, Kenning P, Ahlert D. [http://www.acrwebsite.org/volumes/v34/500830_101409_v2.pdf Why companies should make their customers happy: The neural correlates of customer loyalty]. Adv. Consumer Rese. – North Amer. Conf. Proc., 2007; 34: 735–39.&lt;/ref&gt;  In order to become brand loyal the [[brain]] must make a decision of brand A over brand B, a process which relies on the brain to make predictions based upon expected reward and then evaluate the results to learn loyalty.  The [[brain]] is required to remember both positive and negative outcomes of previous brand choices in order to accurately be able to make predictions regarding the expected outcome of future brand decisions.  For example, a helpful salesman or a discount in price may serve as a reward to encourage future customer loyalty.&lt;ref name="review"/&gt;  It is thought that the [[amygdala]] and [[striatum]] are the two most prominent structures for predicting the outcomes of decisions, and that the [[brain]] learns to better predict in part by establishing a larger [[neural network]] in these structures.&lt;ref&gt;Gottfried JA, O'Doherty J, Dolan RJ. [http://000ev39.myregisteredwp.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3661/2017/01/Encoding-Predictive-Reward-Value-in-Human-Amygdala-and-Orbitofrontal-Cortex.pdf Encoding predictive reward value in human amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex]. Science. Aug 2003;301(5636):1104-1107.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Knutson B, Fong GW, Adams CM, Varner JL, Hommer D.

Dec 2001;12(17):3683-3687.&lt;/ref&gt;

In an attempt to [[Scientific modelling|model]] how the [[brain]] learns, a temporal difference learning algorithm has been developed which takes into account expected reward, stimuli presence, reward evaluation, temporal error, and individual differences.  As yet this is a theoretical [[equation]], but it may be solved in the near future.&lt;ref&gt;Schultz W, Dayan P, Montague PR. A neural substrate of prediction and reward. Science. Mar 1997;275(5306):1593-1599.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== How branding affects consumers ===
[[Brands]] serve to connect [[consumer]]s to the products they are purchasing either by establishing an emotional connection or by creating a particular image.  It has been shown that when consumers are forced to choose an item from a group in which a familiar brand is present the choice is much easier than when consumers are forced to choose from a group of entirely unfamiliar brands.&lt;ref name="Braeutigam"&gt;Braeutigam S, Rose SPR, Swithenby SJ, Ambler T. The distributed neuronal systems supporting choice-making in real-life situations: differences between men and women when choosing groceries detected using magnetoencephalography. European Journal of Neuroscience. Jul 2004;20(1):293-302.&lt;/ref&gt;  One [[MRI]] study found that there was significantly increased activation in the [[brain]] reward centers including the [[orbitofrontal cortex]], the [[ventral striatum]] and the [[anterior cingulate]] when consumers were looking at [[sports cars]] as compared to [[sedans]] (presumably because the status symbol associated with sports cars is rewarding in some way).&lt;ref&gt;Erk S, Kiefer M, Grothe J, Wunderlich AP, Spitzer M, Walter H. [https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Markus_Kiefer/publication/10893254_Emotional_Context_Modulates_Subsequent_Memory_Effect/links/59db2154a6fdcc2aad14d046/Emotional-Context-Modulates-Subsequent-Memory-Effect.pdf Emotional context modulates subsequent memory effect]. Neuroimage. Feb 2003;18(2):439-447.&lt;/ref&gt;  Many [[corporations]] have conducted similar [[MRI]] studies to investigate the effect of their brand on consumers including [[Delta Air Lines]], [[General Motors]], [[Home Depot]], [[Hallmark]], and [[Motorola]] but the results have not been made public.&lt;ref name="Plassman"/&gt;

A study by McClure et al. investigated the difference in branding between [[Coca-Cola]] and [[Pepsi]].  The study found that when the two drinks were tasted blind there was no difference in consumer preference between the brands. Both drinks produced equal activation in the [[ventromedial prefrontal cortex]], which is thought to be activated because the taste is rewarding.  When the subjects were informed of the brand names the consumers preferred [[Coca-Cola|Coke]], and only [[Coca-Cola|Coke]] activated the [[ventromedial prefrontal cortex]], suggesting that drinking the [[Coca-Cola|Coke]] brand is rewarding beyond simply the taste itself.  More subjects preferred [[Coca-Cola|Coke]] when they knew it was [[Coca-Cola|Coke]] than when the taste testing was anonymous, which demonstrates the power of branding to influence consumer behavior.  There was also significant activation in the [[hippocampus]] and [[dorsolateral prefrontal cortex]] when subjects knew they were drinking Coke.  These brain structures are known to play a role in [[memory]] and [[recollection]], which indicates they are helping the subjects to connect their present drinking experience to previous [[brand]] associations.  The study proposes that there are two separate processes contributing to consumer decision making: the [[ventromedial prefrontal cortex]] responds to sensory inputs and the [[hippocampus]] and [[dorsolateral prefrontal cortex]] recall previous associations to cultural information.  According to the results of this study, the Coke brand has much more firmly established itself as a rewarding experience.&lt;ref name="McClure"&gt;McClure SM, Li J, Tomlin D, Cypert KS, Montague LM, Montague PR. [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627304006129 Neural correlates of behavioral preference for culturally familiar drinks]. Neuron. Oct 2004;44(2):379-387.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Purchasing ==
Research in consumer buying has focused on the identification of processes that contribute to an individual making a [[purchase]].  The [[brain]] does not contain a “buy button”, but rather recruits several processes during choice tasks, and studies report that the [[prefrontal cortex]] is heavily involved in limiting the [[emotions]] expressed during [[impulse buying]].  Reducing the effect of these executive control areas of the [[brain]] may contribute to changes in purchasing behavior,&lt;ref name="Ochsner"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ambler T, Braeutigam S, Stins J, Rose S, Swithenby S. [https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/5d7c/d8bd699978260ab2e1b109e11a0cbd18838c.pdf Salience and choice: Neural correlates of shopping decisions]. Psychology &amp; Marketing. Apr 2004;21(4):247-261.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paulus MP, Frank LR. [https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/f0d0/82db9a11210e7be376915d8b89e510ee1c30.pdf Ventromedial prefrontal cortex activation is critical for preference judgments]. NeuroReport. Jul 2003;14(10):1311-1315.&lt;/ref&gt; for example music may lead to reduced cognitive control which is why it has been shown to correlate with a higher percentage of unplanned purchases.&lt;ref&gt;Shiv B, Fedorikhin A. [http://sites.google.com/site/xiaoliangtushuguanfenguan3/gm934xing-wei-jue-ce-zhi-ding/Shiv%26Fedorikhin1999.pdf Heart and mind in conflict: The interplay of affect and cognition in consumer decision making]. J. Consumer Res. Dec 1999; 26: 278–292.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Purchasing process ===
Several [[Magnetoencephalography|MEG]] studies have been conducted to measure the [[neural correlate|neuronal correlates]] associated with decision making in order to investigate the underlying processes governing purchasing.  The studies suggest that decisions involved with purchasing can be seen as occurring in two halves.  The first half is concerned with [[memory|memory recall]] and problem identification and recognition.  The second half is associated with the purchasing decision itself; familiar [[brands]] produce different [[Neural oscillation|brain patterns]] than do nonfamiliar brands.  The [[parietal cortex|right parietal cortex]] is activated when [[consumer]]s choose a familiar brand, which indicates the choice is at least partially intentional and behavior is influenced by prior experiences.&lt;ref name="Ambler2004"&gt;Ambler, T., Braeutigam, S., Stins, J., Rose, S.P.R. &amp; Swithenby, S.J. (2004) [https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/5d7c/d8bd699978260ab2e1b109e11a0cbd18838c.pdf Salience and choice: neural correlates of shopping decisions]. Psychology &amp; Marketing, 21, pp. 247–261.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Familiar vs. unfamiliar purchases ===
When [[consumer]]s select less well known products or products that are completely unfamiliar, several areas of the [[brain]] are activated to help with the decision making process that are not activated when consumers select more well known products.  There is an increased synchronization between the [[dorsolateral prefrontal cortex|right dorsolateral cortices]] (associated with consideration of multiple sources of information), there is increased activity in the [[orbitofrontal cortex|right orbitofrontal cortex]] (associated with evaluation of rewards) and there is increased activity in the [[inferior frontal gyrus|left inferior frontal cortex]] (associated with silent vocalization).  Activation in these [[brain]] structures indicates that the decision between less well known products is difficult in some way.&lt;ref name="Ambler2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Braeutigam"/&gt;  MEG findings also suggest that even repetitive daily shopping that is apparently simple actually relies on very complex neural mechanisms.&lt;ref name="Plassman"/&gt;

== Associated areas of the brain ==

=== Ventromedial prefrontal cortex ===
It has been shown that the [[ventromedial prefrontal cortex]] is heavily involved in decisions regarding brand-related preferences and individuals with damage to this region of the brain do not demonstrate normal brand-preference behavior.&lt;ref name="review"/&gt; People with damage to the ventromedial prefrontal cortex have also been found to be more easily influenced by misleading advertisement.&lt;ref name="Asp, Erik, et al. 2012"&gt;Asp, E., Manzel, K., Koestner, B., Cole, C. A., Denburg, N. L., &amp; Tranel, D. (2012). [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3391647/ A neuropsychological test of belief and doubt: damage to ventromedial prefrontal cortex increases credulity for misleading advertising]. Frontiers in neuroscience, 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Amygdala and striatum ===
It is thought that the [[amygdala]] and [[striatum]] are the two most prominent structures for predicting the outcomes of decisions, and that the [[brain]] learns to better make predictions in part by establishing a larger [[neural network]] in these structures.&lt;ref name="review"/&gt;

===Hippocampus and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex===
The [[hippocampus]] and [[dorsolateral prefrontal cortex]] help consumers recall previous associations with cultural information and cultural expectations.  These associations with prior information serve to modify consumer behavior and influence purchasing decisions.&lt;ref name="McClure"/&gt;

== Real-world applications ==
[[Consumer research]] provides a real-world application for [[neuroscience]] studies.  Consumer studies help [[neuroscience]] to learn more about how healthy and unhealthy brain functions differ, which may assist in discovering the neural source of consumption-related dysfunctions and treat a variety of [[Substance dependence|addictions]].  Additionally, studies are currently underway to investigate the neural mechanism of “anchoring”, which has been thought to contribute to [[obesity]] because people are more influenced by the behaviors of their peers than an internal standard.  Discovering a neural source of anchoring may be the key to preventing behaviors that typically lead to [[obesity]].&lt;ref name="review"/&gt;

==Limitations==
# Most of the consumer neuroscience studies involving [[neuroimaging|brain scanning techniques]] have been conducted in medical or technological environments where such [[neuroimaging|brain imaging devices]] are present.  This is not a realistic environment for consumer decision making and may serve to skew the data relative to consumer decision making in normal consumer environments.&lt;ref name="Plassman"/&gt;
# Testing underlying neurophysiological principles is extraordinarily difficult from an experimental setup standpoint simply because it is unclear exactly how various factors are perceived in the human mind.  An extremely comprehensive understanding of the neuroscientific testing techniques to be used is required to be able to establish proper controls and create an environment such that test subjects are not inadvertently exposed to unwanted stimuli that may bias results.&lt;ref name="Plassman"/&gt;
# There are many concerns over the value and the potential usage of consumer neuroscience data.  The potential for enhanced consumer welfare is certainly present but equally present is the potential for the information to be used inappropriately for individual gain.  The reaction to emerging study results in both the public and the media remains to be seen.&lt;ref name="Plassman"/&gt;
# In its current state, consumer neuroscience research is a compilation of only loosely related subjects that is unable, at this point, to produce any collective conclusions.&lt;ref name="Plassman"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7471">'''''Corporate behaviour''''' is the actions of a company or group who are acting as a single body. It defines the company's ethical strategies and describes the image of the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Quality of life|publisher=Philip Seed, Greg Lloyd|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xPce-i2OO1AC&amp;pg=PA171|accessdate=8 Oct 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Role ==
Not only does corporate behaviour play various roles within different areas of a business, it also enables businesses to overcome any problems they may face. For example, due to an increase in [[globalisation]], language barriers are likely to increase for organisations creating major problems as day-to-day business may be disrupted. Corporate behaviour enables managers to overcome this problem by improving flexibility. Also, many businesses are struggling to remain competitive in terms of quality and productivity due to intense competition within markets. However, corporate behaviour is able to fix this issue by allowing managers to empower their employees as they are the ones who are able to make a change. 
Positive corporate behaviour can result in employees feeling happy and content at work providing their best outcome. This is beneficial for management as it could lead to effective teams being created thus resulting in innovative ideas which is beneficial for the business. It also helps to decrease [[labour turnover]] enabling the organisation to retain its most valuable employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Organisational Behaviour and its Role in Management of Business|publisher=Frederick, Prabha Renuka Horo|url=http://www.ripublication.com/gjfm-spl/gjfmv6n6_12.pdf|accessdate=9 Oct 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Corporate behaviour and political risk|url=https://openaccess.leidenuniv.nl/bitstream/handle/1887/15900/risksbehaviourPUTTEN.pdf?sequence=1|accessdate=9 Oct 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Importance ==
Corporate behaviour is important in strengthening relationships within organisations between individuals, teams, and in the organisation as a whole. It is important as it reflects the values of the business and the extent to which it is ethical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Organizational Behaviour|publisher=Hellriegel, Don &amp; Slocum, John|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=aSQFAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA4&amp;dq=importance+of+organizational+behavior&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=5hg5VNmSMYee7gb3nICICA&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=importance%20of%20organizational%20behavior&amp;f=false|accessdate=7 Oct 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Corporate behavior refers to the company values that defines it and makes it different and better than other companies. Portraying positive corporate behavior within a company facilitates strong [[brand]] image creation; consequently branding then strengthens the importance associated with corporate behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media-network/partner-zone-brand-union/does-culture-define-brand|title=Does culture define the brand?|publisher=the guardian|accessdate=9 Oct 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Influential factors ==
[[PESTLE]] factors influence corporate behaviour in many ways. They cause organisations to change the way they operate, however the size and nature of change is dependent upon which factor is causing the change; (political, economic, social, technological, legal, or environmental).

=== Political ===
Examples of political factors could be changes in government legislation. This could affect an organisations Corporate behaviour as they would have to change the way they operate in order to implement these changes; some employees may not like the new changes made.&lt;ref name="test"&gt;{{cite web|title=THE MACRO ENVIRONMENT &amp; PEST ANALYSIS.|url=http://www.learnmarketing.net/pestanalysis.htm|accessdate=6 Oct 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="test1"&gt;{{cite web|title=PESTLE Analysis.|url=http://www.cipd.co.uk/hr-resources/factsheets/pestle-analysis.aspx|accessdate=7 Oct 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="test 2"&gt;{{cite book|title=Organizational Behaviour and Management|publisher=Martin, John|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=BUDMDCAuRIoC&amp;pg=PA30&amp;dq=PESTLE+company+behaviour&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=GiA5VIiUOMLl7gbf-IHIAQ&amp;ved=0CCAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=PESTLE%20company%20behaviour&amp;f=false|accessdate=9 Oct 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Economic ===
Recession is an example of an economic factor. If the economy were to be in a recession, businesses may find they have to reduce jobs. This would affect Corporate behaviour as business teams would be short of skills and ideas in order to operate effectively.&lt;ref name="test" /&gt;&lt;ref name="test1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="test 2" /&gt;

=== Social ===
Changes in trends and the market is a social factor which affects Corporate behaviour. Organisations may have to change their products or services in order to keep up to date with new trends. In order to do this, employees may be required to learn new skills within a short amount of time to make these changes; relationships between employees and management could be at risk due to these changes.&lt;ref name="test" /&gt;&lt;ref name="test1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="test 2" /&gt;

=== Technological ===
Implementing technology within organisations could mean more virtual meetings and fewer face to face meetings. As a result, relationships between management and employees could weaken as a result of less face to face conversations.&lt;ref name="test" /&gt;&lt;ref name="test1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="test 2" /&gt;

=== Legal ===
Legislative rules such as tax may increase which would increase an organisations costs. Changes such as, changing the way the organisation operates may have to be made in order to cover these extra costs.&lt;ref name="test1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="test 2" /&gt;

=== Environmental ===
Environmental factors could be any factors which prevent damage to the environment. For example, more employees may be required to [[telework]] to reduce the number of employees physically travelling to offices thus reducing carbon dioxide emissions. However this may lead to isolation as communication is reduced, weakening Corporate behaviour within firms.&lt;ref name="test1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="test 2" /&gt;

== Stakeholder influence ==
Businesses have many [[stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholder]]s who influence corporate behaviour. However, businesses who adopt the [[stakeholder theory]] are likely to appeal more to their stakeholders as they are showing their care and commitment towards them. This helps to strengthen the Corporate behaviour within a firm and reduces the need for stakeholders to demand change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Strategic Management: A Stakeholder Approach|publisher=Freeman, R.Edward|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=NpmA_qEiOpkC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=stakeholder%20approach&amp;f=false|accessdate=6 Oct 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Strategy for Sustainable Competitive Advantage|publisher=Chaston, Ian|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=H6DcuJNr79YC&amp;pg=PA120&amp;dq=stakeholder+influence+on+organisational+behaviour&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=giE5VOyMDIac7gbLhYCYBA&amp;ved=0CCAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=stakeholder%20influence%20on%20organisational%20behaviour&amp;f=false|accessdate=7 Oct 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A commercial [[company]] may choose to list its [[share (finance)|share]]s in a [[stock exchange]] of a country other than that in which the company is based. This practice is known as "cross-border listing" or "cross-listing". Firms may adopt cross-border listing to obtain advantages that include lower cost of capital, expanded global shareholder base, greater liquidity in the trading of shares, prestige and publicity. Decision makers also need to be satisfied that the benefits exceed possible costs, such as listing costs, exposure to legal liabilities, taxes and various trading frictions, and reconciliation of financial statements with varying national standards.&lt;ref name=karolyi&gt;{{cite journal|last=Karolyi|title=The world of cross-listing and cross-listing of the world: Challenging conventional wisdom’|journal=Review of Finance|year=2006|volume= 10|pages=99–152}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Karolyi A., 2006,)

==Financial gains ==
Existing regulation in local capital market like [[taxes]], information asymmetry and foreign ownership restrictions usually act as barriers and prevent foreign investors entering those markets. In addition, local investors in segmented domestic capital markets in order to undertake the risk tighten to the local market usually require a risk premium. In order to counter these problem domestic firms can adopt policies such as listing in a foreign exchange in order to offset the negative effects of market segmentation and offer several other straightforward advantages that stem from lower transaction costs (Khurana et al., 2005). Further more, cross border listing serves as a mean for foreign investors to save any transaction costs associated with dealing in a foreign currency as well as to effectively bend any existing foreign exchange regulations since they are allowed to trade share in their own [[currency]]. Taken into account that cross-listing serves to lower barriers to foreign investment cross-border listing serves effectively in reducing the firms costs related to market segmentation and therefore lowers the cost of external financing  (Alexander et al. cited in Khurana et al., 2005).

==Bonding ==
The ability to prevent shareholders or managers to acquire private benefits from their firms is an important aspect of corporate governance since it represents an important source of potential conflict with public shareholders.  After all the rationale of raising external capital must be towards that it must be raised only after management's commitment to return this capital to investors and not to extract it for the controlling shareholders' personal use (Karolyi, 2006). Stulz (1999) as cited in Karolyi (2006), placed emphasis on the potential agency conflicts and information asymmetry problems that corporate managers or controlling shareholders would face with public shareholders in their effort to raise external capital. Agency conflicts could arise in the case where the set of actions of corporate managers or controlling shareholders are not aligned with the interests of public shareholders. On the other hand, information problems may arise if the management of the company, although having good information about future cash flows, is unable to credibly convince investors about the accuracy of these cash flows (Karolyi, 2006). Managers can alter those problems if they choose to bond themselves in a better governance regime by cross-listing in order to commit not to engage in illegal activities and as a result they can increase the firms’ value since they are able to raise external capital. Consequently, cross border listing effectively improves a company’s corporate governance regime and this particularly true for such companies that come from countries with inadequate supervision and disclosure standards (Karolyi, 2006; Witmer, 2006,Pagano et al., 2002). In addition, firms that decide to list their shares on a more demanding exchange in terms of disclosure and corporate governance standards enjoy a better post listing profitability than those that cross list in other exchanges. Karolyi (1998) as cited in Pagano et al. (1999), after surveying several number of studies showed that the price reaction is significant for foreign listings in the US which is the country with the highest disclosure standards, whereas it is insignificant otherwise.

==Awareness and investor recognition==
Merton (1987) as cited in Khurana et al. (2005) tries to explain the rationale behind a firm’s decision to cross-list its shares by the [[investor]] recognition hypothesis. According to this hypothesis stock trading behaviour of investors is affected from the lack of information. Consequently, this behaviour affects the related share price since investors with incomplete information are reluctant to include those shares in their investment portfolios, requiring a risk premium in order to include those shares in their portfolios. Through cross listing firms can increase investor awareness and expand its potential investor base on their securities more easily than if it traded on a single market. Cross border listing enhances the credibility of a firm by providing information to the local capital market therefore the continue flow of information allow the capital market to make faster and more accurate decisions (Licht, 2004). Further more, listing a company’s shares in a major and prestigious stock exchange like NYSE or LSE is accompanied with increased coverage and local media attention which in turn enhances visibility (Pagano et al., 2002). Supporting this argument, Baker et al., (1998) as cited in Witmer (2006), in their study looked how foreign firms’ visibility is affected after cross listing either on [[NYSE]] or LSE using two proxies for visibility: the firm’s analyst following and media coverage. According to their findings an average of six more analysts follow the firm after a listing on NYSE and an average of three analysts following the firm after a LSE listing. In addition, they found an average increase in home media coverage by 37 and 11percent after NYSE and LSE cross-listing respectively.

==Liquidity==
In order for a market to be liquid transactions must be executed rapidly and with little impact on prices.  Firms pursue cross border listings since it reduces transaction costs via an improvement in market liquidity following the foreign listing. The relationship between liquidity and cross listing lies upon the global competition for order flow (trading volume). Consequently, exchanges are forced to continuously look for ways to improve their trading processes in order to enhance market quality and maintain or attract order flow.  The benefits that companies seek to gain through cross border listing come as a reduction in the firm’s bid ask price resulting in an increase in firm’s valuation, therefore this improved liquidity is more likely to attract more institutional investors. Low liquidity is perceived as a barrier for institutional investors that prevent them from holding the firms stock due to the high trading costs associated in holding this security (Witmer, 2006; Chouinard &amp; D’Souza, 2003). Further more, the proportion of total trading volume that the new market captures along with the trading restrictions imposed on foreigners prior to listing are factors that affect the extent to which liquidity is enhanced. In addition, another factor favouring the enhancement of liquidity, especially for listing firms that come from emerging markets, is the existence of informational links between markets. If informational links for example were poor for listing firms that come from emerging markets cross-listing would actually reduce liquidity and increase volatility on the domestic market as informative trades were directed to other markets (Domowitz et al. 1998 cited in Chouinard &amp; D’Souza, 2003).

==Capital raising==
Another benefit that cross border listing provides to foreign companies is the improved terms by which they can raise external capital either because credit constraints are relaxed, or because of the existence of the bonding effect due to which investor protection is increased. The benefits of cross listing are further increased in the case that either the firm or its shareholders due to financial constraints present in the home market  serve as barriers to capital raising (Witmer, 2006; Pagano et al., 2002). In addition, evidence found in prior research of Reese and Weisbach (2002) as cited in Witmer (2006) demonstrated an increase in the capital raising as a result of the bonding hypothesis in that a firm’s ability to raise capital in its own market is enhanced through cross listing. More over, firms perceive cross border listings as a mean to raise capital needed to finance future investment projects. Fast growing firms are the ones that are more likely to experience the benefits of the increased funding (Pagano et al., 2002).&lt;ref name=karolyi /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Khurana I., Martin X. and Periera R., 2007, ‘Cross-listing and Firm Growth’, Working Paper, University of Missouri &amp;ndash; Columbia&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Dental Laboratories Association''' (DLA) is the professional body for dental laboratory owners in the [[United Kingdom]]. It is estimated that members of the DLA are responsible for over 80 per cent of the dental laboratory services in the UK.

== Origin ==
The DLA began as a division of the Surgical Instrument Manufacturers Association, later becoming a separate entity. The first meeting of the DLA Council took place in London in 1961. The first Secretary was John Wrench and administration was provided by a firm of accountants called Hughes Allan. 

In 1977 Trevor Roadley, a [[Nottingham]] dental laboratory owner was appointed as Secretary. Operating initially at his laboratory and then in the DLA's first premises, Roadley gradually built up the range of member services and heightened the standing of the association. The DLA moved to larger premises in Nottingham in 1986, a converted chapel that was being used as a dental laboratory. At this stage the DLA had approximately 400 members. In 1987 Bill Courtney took over as Secretary. Like Trevor before him, Bill was a dental laboratory owner and member of the DLA Council. 

By now the DLA was a recognised and respected member of the dental world and regularly met with organisations such as the [[General Dental Council]], [[Orthodontic Technicians Association]], [[British Dental Association]] and the [[Department of Health]]. These close relationships continue to this day and the DLA has presented evidence to the [[Health Select Committee]] at the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] on the challenges faced by the profession. 

The DLA was instrumental in setting up the Dental Technicians Education and Training Advisory Board (DTETAB), which is now known as the [[Dental Technologists Association]] (DTA). The late 1980s and early 1990s saw the emergence of the [[Medical Devices Directive]] and the introduction of Quality Systems to the industry. The DLA worked to establish an industry-led standard and the first example of this was a system based on BS 5750 called the Certification Authority for Dental Laboratories and Suppliers (CADLAS), which is still operating as AMTAC MEDICA and is now audited to ISO9002. With the lessons learned in setting up CADLAS, a new system called the Dental Appliance Manufacturers Audit Scheme (DAMAS) was launched in 1998. This is based around ISO 9000 and also addresses the Medical Devices Regulations (MDR). 

By now the Association membership had risen to over 900 and the association moved into new offices at Arboretum Gate in February 1997.  

There have been many changes since 2000, including the retirement of Bill Courtney and appointment of Richard Daniels as Chief Executive. Membership has passed the 1,000 mark, and the DLA is building a profile as a campaigning organisation with appearances across the media.

== Offices ==
In May 2001 the Association moved to their current offices on Wollaton Road, [[Beeston, Nottinghamshire|Beeston]] in [[Nottingham]].

== Logo ==
The DLA logo is circular in shape with the initials "DLA" in the middle.

== Current activities ==
The DLA's current projects include:

*DAMAS 
*Occupational standards for technicians 
*Training trainers (lab owners) 
*Business advice systems 
*Business seminars 
*Health &amp; safety advice 
*Employment advice 
*Materials non-conformance reporting 
*British Standards (including sports mouthguards) 
*Statutory Registration of technicians 
*Lobbying for ringfenced fees for NHS work 
*Running conferences, exhibitions and seminars 
*Regional meetings and roadshows 
*European affairs concerning laboratories 
*IDEA - Inspiring Dental Education &amp; Advice 

The DLA is a member of the [[British Dental Health Foundation]] (BDHF), the [[Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents]] (RoSPA) and the Federation of European Dental Laboratory Owners (FEPPD). 

==Events==
===Dental Technology Showcase (DTS)===
As the flagship event of the Dental Laboratories Association (DLA), the Dental Technology Showcase (DTS) is a highly respected platform for dental technicians, clinical dental technicians and lab owners to update and refresh their knowledge and skills.

Held alongside The Dentistry Show since 2014, the event offers vast networking opportunities as well as outstanding education, verifiable CPD and access to the very latest innovations in the UK industry.

DTS 2015 will take place on Friday 17th and Saturday 18th April at the NEC in Birmingham UK, ensuring a convenient and central location for thousands of dental professionals to attend. An extensive trade exhibition will host over 100 leading dental suppliers and manufacturers including 3Shape, Bracon, Cendres + Metaux, [[Nobel Biocare]], [[Straumann]], Metrodent, Ivoclar Vivadent and Schottlander to name but a few, each demonstrating the latest products, materials and technologies available. Experts will be on hand to provide any information, advice or guidance you may need, helping you to choose the most suitable equipment for optimal clinical results, streamlined workflows and maximum return on investment.

Further information about DTS can be found online: http://www.the-dts.co.uk/

'''Dioceldo Sy''' (born March 6, 1958&lt;ref&gt;http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/sports/03/02/14/will-blackwater-be-11th-team-pba&lt;/ref&gt;) is a Filipino businessman, sportsman, and team owner of [[Blackwater Elite]] in the [[Philippine Basketball Association]]. He is the sole proprietor of Ever Bilena Cosmetics, Inc. which he established in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;http://everbilena.com.ph/index.php/publicsite/about_us&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==

Sy started out as a messenger and clerk for his grandfather's pomade business. Through his grandfather, who was a Chinese immigrant, he learned about trading and dealing with people.

He studied, and at the same time played basketball, at UNO High School during his secondary years and at [[Philippine School of Business Administration|PSBA]] for his college education.  After two years in college, he dropped out to work full-time for his grandfather. However, when his grandfather's business went bankrupt in 1980, he found himself in the streets and with no job. During this time, he became a freelance trader, buying and selling anything.

In 1983, with his savings from buying and selling, he put up his own cosmetic company, which is now known as Ever Bilena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nepomuceno|first1=Rod|title=To Sy is to believe|url=http://www.philstar.com/business-life/373255/sy-believe|publisher=Philippine Star|accessdate=10 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; From a single-line company selling nail polish, Ever Bilena has grown into a major player in the cosmetics industry with over 1,000 products in the market. He has branched out into commercial ventures in food, health drinks, fragrances, soap and detergents.

==Sports and charity work==
As a sportsman and team owner, he bankrolled several basketball teams that bear the brands of his products, such as Blu Detergent and Shark Energy Drink in the [[Philippine Basketball League|PBL]], Ever Bilena Gandang Pinay in the [[Women's Philippine Basketball League|WPBL]] and [[Blackwater Sports (PBA D-League)|Blackwater Sports]] in the [[PBA Developmental League|PBA D-League]]. These teams brought home several championships through the years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Henson|first1=Joaquin|title=Blackwater set to join PBA as 11th franchise|url=http://www.philstar.com/sports/2014/03/02/1296145/blackwater-set-join-pba-11th-franchise|publisher=Philippine Star}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is former PBL chairman, and has been financing the stints of the Philippine women’s basketball team in several international tournaments and has been known to support charitable causes. He donated a P1.8 Million payloader to the Tacloban city government in the wake of the Yolanda tragedy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Henson|first1=Joaquin|title=Blackwater team owner donates payloader|url=http://www.philstar.com/sports/2013/12/28/1272746/blackwater-team-owner-donates-payloader|publisher=Philippine Star|accessdate=10 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He gave [[Asi Taulava]] his first break in Philippine basketball by signing him to play for Blu Detergent in the PBL in 1997&lt;ref&gt;http://www.spin.ph/basketball/news/new-pba-team-blackwater-sports-keen-to-lure-asi-taulava-into-its-fold-when-his-contract-expires-in-august&lt;/ref&gt; and was once close to managing [[Manny Pacquiao]] before he became a world champion. He is chairman of the Philippine Secondary School Basketball Championship (PSSBC).&lt;ref&gt;http://sports.inquirer.net/132785/early-clash-of-champs-in-pssbc-tournament&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Domicilium citandi et executandi''''' is a [[Latin]] legal term meaning the address nominated by a party in a [[legal contract]] where legal notices may be sent; the onus usually being upon that party to notify the other signatory of any change in address, especially to be ready to receive any notice that is delivered to that address.

For instance, the delivery of a [[legal notice]] to the address of the ''domicilium citandi et executandi'' of a party to a contract can be considered legally sufficient for that notice to be considered received by that party, without the need for the person giving notice actually to find the person.

One or both parties to a contract may demand the other nominate a ''domicilium citandi et executandi'', typically in order to expedite later legal procedures relating to a contract by making it impossible for a party to claim that a legal notice was not received.

The literal translation from Latin into English is "house for summoning and upkeep".

The Latin term is commonly used within the [[legal jurisdiction]] of [[Zimbabwe]] and [[South Africa]].

'''Edward Biddle''' (1738–1779) was an American [[soldier]], [[lawyer]], and statesman from [[Pennsylvania]]. He was a delegate to the [[Continental Congress]] in 1774 and 1775 and a signatory to the [[Continental Association]].

==Biography==
Edward was the son of William (1698–1756) and Mary (Scull) (1709–1790) Biddle. He was born in 1738 at [[Philadelphia]], and had nine brothers and sisters, although two died in infancy. His formal education was limited to the common (public) schools and ended at about age fourteen. When the [[French and Indian War]] began in 1754 he joined the provincial forces as an Ensign. By the time he left the service, at the end of the war in 1763 he had been promoted to Captain.

On June 6, 1761 Edward married Elizabeth Ross, the sister of [[George Ross (delegate)|George Ross]]. After the war he [[read law]] in the offices of her brother. By 1767 he had been admitted to the bar, and the couple moved to [[Reading, Pennsylvania|Reading]] where he began his practice. Although the couple had no children, they both came from large families. The [[Betsy Ross]] who gained fame as the seamstress of the first American flag was the wife of her nephew.  He was the uncle of Congressman [[Richard Biddle]].

==Pennsylvania Provincial Assembly==
Also in 1767 Biddle began his career in the [[Pennsylvania Provincial Assembly]] as a representative for [[Berks County, Pennsylvania|Berks County]]. He would serve there until the colonial assembly went out of business during the [[American Revolution|Revolution]]. He was also a member of the rebel provincial congress, and later the state [[Pennsylvania General Assembly|General Assembly]] until 1778. He was a leader within that body of the [[Patriot (American Revolution)|Whig]] or radical group in the struggle to set Pennsylvania's course in the revolution.

In 1774 Pennsylvania was divided about the looming revolution. The loyalists and the supporters of the Penn family in the Assembly were joined by the [[Religious Society of Friends|Quakers]] who opposed any war. As a result, in July, the Assembly sent a split delegation to the Continental Congress: [[Joseph Galloway|Galloway]], [[Charles Humphreys|Humphreys]], and [[Samuel Rhoads|Rhoads]] were all moderates, while Biddle, [[Thomas Mifflin|Mifflin]], [[John Morton (American politician)|Morton]], and [[George Ross (delegate)|Ross]] were radicals.

That [[first Continental Congress]] produced a statement or [[Declaration and Resolves of the First Continental Congress|Declaration of Rights]], as well as a plan of union and pleas to [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George]] to resolve the issues that separated the colonies from [[Great Britain]]. They also produced a renewal of the [[Continental Association|non-importation agreement]] that had been used during the [[Stamp Act 1765|Stamp Act]] protests. Edward Biddle was a member of the committee that drafted to Declaration of Rights, and later oversaw the printing of the resolutions the Congress had passed.

Early in 1775, Governor [[John Penn (governor)|John Penn]] called the Assembly into session, intent on having Pennsylvania send its own declarations to the crown. These would be based on the [[Galloway Plan]] that had been rejected by the [[Continental Congress]], and would try to reconcile Pennsylvania with the British government. But the legislature mirrored the growing split within the colonies. The Whigs, led by Biddle and [[George Ross (delegate)|George Ross]] and [[John Dickinson (delegate)|John Dickinson]] won the day. Edward Biddle was elected speaker, replacing [[Joseph Galloway]] who had held the post the previous year. The actions of the Continental Congress were approved, and a more radical delegation was named to the next Congress.

Biddle died in Chatsworth, [[Baltimore County, Maryland]] on September 5, 1779. He is buried in St. Pauls Churchyard in [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]].

==Description and history==
The Financial District encompasses roughly the area south of [[City Hall Park]] in Lower Manhattan but excludes [[Battery Park]] and [[Battery Park City]]. The former [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]] complex was located in the neighborhood until the [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001 attacks]]; the neighborhood includes the successor [[One World Trade Center]]. The heart of the Financial District is often considered to be the corner of Wall Street and [[Broad Street (Manhattan)|Broad Street]], both of which are contained entirely within the district.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite aia5}}, p.7&lt;/ref&gt; The northeastern part of the financial district (along [[Fulton Street (Manhattan)|Fulton Street]] and John Street) was known in the early 20th century as the Insurance District, due to the large number of insurance companies that were either headquartered there, or maintained their New York offices there.

Until the late 20th and early 21st century, the neighborhood was considered to be primarily a destination for [[day trading|daytime traders]] and office workers from around New York City and the surrounding areas. The neighborhood now has a growing number of full-time residents, to an estimated 61,000 residents as of 2018,&lt;ref name=FiDi2018/&gt; over double the 23,000 recorded at the 2000 Census,&lt;ref name=FiDi2014/&gt; with many buildings being converted from office space to apartments and [[condominium]]s after the September 11, 2001 attacks.

Although the term is sometimes used as a synonym for ''[[Wall Street]]'', the latter term is often applied [[metonym]]ously to the financial markets as a whole (and is also a street in the district), whereas "the Financial District" implies an actual geographical location. The Financial District is part of [[Manhattan Community Board 1]], which also includes five other neighborhoods ([[Battery Park City]], [[Civic Center, Manhattan|Civic Center]], [[Greenwich South]], [[South Street Seaport|Seaport]], and [[Tribeca]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nyc.gov/html/mancb1/html/district/about.shtml About the District], Manhattan Community Board 1 (accessed October 6, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Points of interest===
[[Federal Hall|Federal Hall National Memorial]], on the site of the first [[United States Capitol|U.S. Capitol]] and the [[first inauguration of George Washington]] as the first [[President of the United States]], is located at the corner of Wall Street and [[Nassau Street (Manhattan)|Nassau Street]].

The Financial District has a number of tourist attractions such as the adjacent [[South Street Seaport]] Historic District, the [[New York City Police Museum]], and [[Museum of American Finance]].  [[Bowling Green (Manhattan)|Bowling Green]] is the starting point of traditional [[ticker-tape parade]]s on [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]], where here it is also known as the [[Canyon of Heroes]].  The [[Museum of Jewish Heritage]] and the [[Skyscraper Museum]] are both in adjacent [[Battery Park City]] which is also home to the [[Brookfield Place (New York City)|Brookfield Place]] (formerly World Financial Center).

The '''Four Queens Hotel and Casino''' is located in downtown [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]] on the [[Fremont Street Experience]]. The 690-room hotel and {{convert|40000|sqft|abbr=on}} casino is owned and operated by TLC Enterprises, which acquired the property from the [[Elsinore (company)|Elsinore Corporation]] in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20030430005790/en/Elsinore-Corp.-Announces-Agreement-Sell-Queens-Hotel&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Construction began on November 16, 1964.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} The $5.5 million project was planned to include an 18-story hotel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wade|first=Dell|title=Year of Progress, Recession, Plans|url=https://newspaperarchive.com/a-j-other-articles-clipping-jan-03-1965-425820/|accessdate=December 8, 2017|work=Las Vegas Sun|date=January 3, 1965|via=NewspaperArchive.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four Queens opened on June 2, 1966. The casino is named after the builder Ben Goffstein's four daughters, Faith, Hope, Benita, and Michele. It originally contained only 120 rooms and a {{convert|20000|sqft|abbr=on}} casino.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} The 18-story hotel building was eventually added.&lt;ref name=Emp&gt;{{cite web|title=Four Queens Hotel and Casino|url=https://www.emporis.com/complex/109939/four-queens-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas-nv-usa|accessdate=December 8, 2017|publisher=Emporis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1972 to 2003 the hotel/casino was owned by [[Elsinore (company)|Elsinore Corporation]], a wholly owned subsidiary of the [[Hyatt Corporation]] until 1979, when it became an independent company. In 1995, Elsinore filed for [[Chapter 11]] bankruptcy and the investment firm Morgens, Waterfall, Vintiadis &amp; Company obtained 99 percent ownership of the company.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/Elsinore-Corporation-Company-History.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1976 the casino expanded to {{convert|33000|sqft|abbr=on}} and changed decor to be warmer.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} A second 18-story hotel building was completed in 1981.&lt;ref name=Emp/&gt;

Today the casino occupies the entire block bordered by Fremont Street, Casino Center, Third Street and Carson Avenue. The Four Queens was also a partner in renovating the downtown area and creating the Fremont Street Experience.

In December 2003 the Four Queens casino was the first Las Vegas casino to offer Geoff Hall's [[Blackjack]] variant [[Blackjack Switch]], which is now widely available throughout Las Vegas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thepogg.com/thepogg-interviews-geoff-hall-creator-of-blackjack-switch/ |title=ThePOGG Interviews – Geoff Hall – The creator of Blackjack Switch |date=27 November 2012  |author=ThePOGG }}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2007 the Canyon Club opened at the Four Queens, providing the first downtown casino club.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} The hotel contains 690 rooms as of 2017.&lt;ref name=Emp/&gt;

'''George Carter I''' (1777{{mdash}}1846), son of [[Robert Carter III|Robert "Councillor" Carter the III]] and [[Frances Ann Tasker Carter]] was an American plantation owner most famous for his building of [[Oatlands Plantation]], an [[estate (house)|estate]] located in [[Leesburg, Virginia]], and as one of the wealthiest individuals in Virginia's [[Loudoun County, Virginia|Loudoun County]] during the early 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Oatlands, The Journey Through Hallowed Ground - Gettysburg to Monticello, http://www.hallowedground.org/African-American-Heritage/Oatlands&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
George's father Robert Carter III was famous for his [[manumission]] of 452 slaves during his lifetime and for being an outspoken critic of slavery in colonial America. Rather than send George to his own alma mater, [[College of William &amp; Mary|William &amp; Mary]], Robert sent George to the ''College in the English Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations'' (now [[Brown University]]), writing to its president [[James Manning (minister)|James Manning]] that his sole motivation for doing so was Virginia's devotion to slavery, and that "On this consideration only, I do not intend that these two sons shall return to this State till each of them arrive at the age of 21 years."&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1298&amp;dat=20020608&amp;id=O_EyAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=pwgGAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2514,2099633 ''The Way It Was''] in The Free Lance-Star - 8 June 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

After six years in Rhode Island, George began studying law at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], but left shortly thereafter, relocating in 1798&lt;ref&gt;http://oatlandsva.wordpress.com/2010/08/19/george-carter-the-slave-owner/&lt;/ref&gt; at the age of 21 to take up management of the 3400 acres of land his father owned in Loudon County.

==Building of Oatlands Plantation==
George began construction of [[Oatlands Plantation]] in 1804, and would continue to build on this estate throughout his life.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nps.gov/nr/travel/journey/oat.htm&lt;/ref&gt; George's father Robert had begun emancipating slaves in 1791, a process which proved to be a long and drawn out legal affair as well as taxing on the Carter family's wealth. In 1805, George Carter filed suit in an attempt to stop the remaining emancipations of Carter slaves, but the Virginia Court of Appeals ruled against George in 1808. George needed slaves for his work at Oatlands and thus set about buying more to replace those being emancipated.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1298&amp;dat=20020608&amp;id=O_EyAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=pwgGAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2514,2099633 ''The Way It Was''] in The Free Lance-Star - 8 June 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Census records indicate that in 1800, Oatlands had 10 slaves, and by 1860, 128 slaves.&lt;ref&gt;http://oatlandsva.wordpress.com/2010/08/19/george-carter-the-slave-owner/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
George did not marry until 1835, at age 58, when he wed Elizabeth Osborne Carter, widow of [[Joseph Lewis Jr.]]. George had earlier suggested in an 1816 letter that in one of his "vicious and corrupt" habits he had "been too open, and not used dissumulation enough, and have rendered myself liable to be animadverted upon - but in this I comfort myself in knowing that I have no mulatto children."&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1298&amp;dat=20020608&amp;id=O_EyAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=pwgGAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2514,2099633 ''The Way It Was''] in The Free Lance-Star - 8 June 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Identifying and Managing Project Risk''''' by [[Tom Kendrick]] is a book about identifying and managing risks on projects. It was published on April 25, 2003 by American Management Association.

== Overview ==
Kendrick's coverage of [[risk]], and more prominently [[uncertainty]], is complete in a general fashion focusing a majority of his discussion on risk in projects due to poor planning and [[change management]] processes.

He uses a collection of project elements from various projects his clients have conducted.  He uses this data, Project Experience Risk Information Library (PERIL) database, to quantify and rank classes of risk.  In the early part of his book he uses this significantly and the Appendix lists approximately 120 of the element's descriptions.

The book is structured to follow the PMBOK stages of a project &amp;mdash; initiation, planning, controlling, executing and closure. Each chapter discusses a set of concepts and concludes with a bulleted "Key Ideas" section and an anecdote from the two attempts to construct the Panama Canal.

==Reception==
Critical reception has been positive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Straker|first1=David|title=Main content area Identifying and Managing Project Risk (review)|journal=Quality Progress|date=2004|volume=37|issue=6|page=97|url=http://search.proquest.com.ezproxy2.library.drexel.edu/docview/214761752?pq-origsite=summon&amp;accountid=10559|accessdate=18 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nalewaik|first1=Alexia|title=Identifying and Managing Project Risk (review)|journal=Cost Engineering|date=2003|volume=45|issue=12|page=25|url=http://search.proquest.com.ezproxy2.library.drexel.edu/docview/220449584?pq-origsite=summon&amp;accountid=10559|accessdate=18 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Strategic Finance]]'' reviewed the book's third edition, praising it as "a great resource for new and experienced project managers because it reflects the most recent changes to the Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK® Guide) from the Project Management Institute."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Leist|first1=Ryan|title=BOOK REVIEW: PROJECT RISK PLANNING|url=http://sfmagazine.com/post-entry/september-2015-book-review-project-risk-planning/|publisher=Strategic Finance|accessdate=18 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Quality Management Journal'' also wrote a favorable review for the work, which they felt was "insightful".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kohnen|first1=James B|title=Identifying and Managing Project Risk: Essential Tools for Failure-Proofing Your Project (review)|journal=The Quality Management Journal|date=2004|volume=11|issue=2|pages=54–55|url=http://search.proquest.com.ezproxy2.library.drexel.edu/docview/213611973?pq-origsite=summon&amp;accountid=10559|accessdate=18 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Injection molding of liquid silicone rubber''' (LSR) is a process to produce pliable, durable parts in high volume.

[[Liquid silicone rubber]] is a high purity platinum cured [[silicone]] with low compression set, great stability and ability to resist extreme temperatures of heat and cold ideally suitable for production of parts, where high quality is a must. Due to the [[Thermosetting polymer|thermosetting]] nature of the material, liquid silicone [[injection molding]] requires special treatment, such as intensive distributive mixing, while maintaining the material at a low temperature before it is pushed into the heated cavity and [[Vulcanization|vulcanized]].

Chemically, silicone rubber is a family of [[Thermosetting_polymer|thermoset]] [[Elastomer|elastomers]] that have a backbone of alternating silicon and oxygen atoms and [[methyl]] or [[Vinyl group|vinyl]] side groups. Silicone rubbers constitute about 30% of the silicone family, making them the largest group of that family. Silicone rubbers maintain their mechanical properties over a wide range of temperatures and the presence of methyl-groups in silicone rubbers makes these materials extremely [[Hydrophobe|hydrophobic]], making them suitable for electrical surface insulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.azom.com/article.aspx?ArticleID=6773|title=Silicone in Medium-to-High Voltage Electrical Applications|date=2012-09-07|website=AZoM.com|access-date=2018-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Typical applications for liquid silicone rubber are products that require high precision such as seals, sealing membranes, electric connectors, multi-pin connectors, infant products where smooth surfaces are desired, such as bottle nipples, medical applications as well as kitchen goods such as baking pans, spatulas, etc. Often, silicone rubber is [[overmold]]ed onto other parts made of different plastics. For example, a silicone button face might be overmolded onto an [[Nylon|Nylon 6,6]] housing.

==Equipment==
In order for the liquid injection molding process to fully occur, several mechanical components must be in place. Typically, a molding machine requires a metered pumping device in conjunction with an injection unit—a dynamic or static mixer is attached. An integrated system can aid in precision and process efficiency. The critical components of a liquid injection molding machine include:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thomasnet.com/articles/plastics-rubber/liquid-injection-molding Liquid Injection Molding]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Injectors.''' An injecting device is responsible for pressurizing the liquid silicone to aid in the injection of the material into the pumping section of the machine. Pressure and injection rate can be adjusted at the operator’s discretion.

'''Metering Units.''' Metering units pump the two primary liquid materials, the catalyst and the base forming silicone, ensuring that the two materials maintain a constant ratio while being simultaneously released.

'''Supply Drums.'''  Supply drums, also called plungers, serve as the primary containers for mixing materials. Both the supply drums and a container of pigment connect to the main pumping system.

'''Mixers.'''  A static or dynamic mixer combines materials after they exit the metering units. Once combined, pressure is used to drive the mixture into a designated mold.

'''Nozzle.''' To facilitate the deposition of the mixture into the mold, a nozzle is used. Often, the nozzle features an automatic shut-off valve to help prevent leaking and overfilling the mold.

'''Mold Clamp.''' A mold clamp secures the mold during the injection molding process, and opens the mold upon completion.

== Characteristics of LSR ==
'''Biocompatibility''': Under extensive testing, liquid silicone rubber has demonstrated superior compatibility with human tissue and body fluids. In comparison to other elastomers, LSR is resistant to bacteria growth and will not stain or corrode other materials. LSR is also tasteless and odorless and can be formulated to comply with stringent FDA requirements. The material can be sterilized via a variety of methods, including steam autoclaving, ethylene oxide (ETO), gamma, e-beam and numerous other techniques, meeting all required approvals such as BfR XV, FDA 21 CFR 177.2600, USP Class VI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=LSR specific properties|last1=LSR specific properties|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160314231708/http://www.cva-silicone.com/en/lsr-specific-properties}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Durable''': LSR parts can withstand extreme temperatures, which makes them an ideal choice for components under the hood of cars and in close proximity to engines. Parts fabricated via liquid silicone rubber injection molding are fire retardant and will not melt.

'''Chemical resistance''': Liquid silicone rubber resists water, oxidation and some chemical solutions such as acids and alkali.

'''Temperature resistance''': Compared to other elastomers, silicone can withstand a wide range of high/low temperature extremes.

'''Mechanical properties''': LSR has good elongation, high tear and tensile strength, excellent flexibility and a hardness range of 5 to 80 Shore A.

'''Electrical properties''': LSR has excellent insulating properties, which offer an appealing option for a host of electrical applications. Compared to conventional insulating material, silicone can perform in far higher and lower temperatures.

'''Transparency and pigmentation''':  LSR possesses a natural transparency, this attribute makes it possible to produce, colorful, custom, molded products&lt;ref&gt;http://www.simtec-silicone.com/capabilities/liquid-silicone-rubber/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Injection molding process ==

Liquid [[silicone rubber]]s are supplied in barrels. Because of their low viscosity, these [[rubbers]] can be pumped through pipelines and tubes to the [[vulcanization]] equipment. The two components are pumped through a static mixer by a [[metering pump]]. One of the components contains the [[catalyst]], typically [[platinum]] based. A coloring paste as well as other additives can also be added before the material enters the static mixer section. In the static mixer the components are well mixed and are transferred to the cooled metering section of the injection molding machine. The static mixer renders a very homogeneous material that results in products that are not only very consistent throughout the part, but also from part to part. This is in contrast to solid silicone rubber materials that are purchased pre-mixed and partially vulcanized. In contrast, hard silicone rubbers are processed by [[transfer molding]] and result in less material consistency and control, leading to higher part variability. Additionally, solid silicone rubber materials are processed at higher temperatures and require longer vulcanization times.

Liquid silicone has a very low viscosity index and requires perfect seals of the mould cavity in order to guarantee a burr-free finished product.
As injections are carried out at high temperature, steel dilation and natural shrinkage of materials must be considered at the design stage of the LSR injection tooling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=LSR Mold technology|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160529145322/http://www.cva-silicone.com:80/en/lsr-molds-technology}}&lt;/ref&gt;   

From the metering section of the injection molding machine, the compound is pushed through cooled [[Sprue (manufacturing)|sprue]] and [[Runner (casting)|runner]] systems into a heated cavity where the [[vulcanization]] takes place. The cold runner and general cooling results in no loss of material in the feed lines. The cooling allows production of LSR parts with nearly zero material waste, eliminating trimming operations and yielding significant savings in material cost.

Liquid silicone rubbers are supplied in a variety of containers, from tubes to 55 gallon drums. Because of their viscous nature, these liquids are pumped at high pressures (500 - 5000 psi) based on the durometer of the material. The raw materials are shipped in two separate containers (known in the industry as a kit) identified as "A" and B" compounds, with the "B" side usually containing the catalyst, but may vary based on the brand of silicone used. The two (A and B) compounds must be mixed in a 1 to 1 ratio, usually by way of a static mixer, adding pigment during the mixing process before the curing process begins.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.silbione.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/LSR-Users-Guide.pdf|title=Liquid Silicone Rubber — Injection Molding Guide|last=|first=|date=|website=Bluestar Silicones|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once the two components come together the curing process begins immediately. A chiller supplying cold water to jacketed fittings is typically used to retard the curing process prior to the materials introduction to the mold. A color pigment can be added via a color injector used in conjunction with the material pump (closed loop metering system) before the material enters the static mixer section.

In a cold deck scenario, the 1 to 1 mixed compound is pumped through cooled [[Sprue (manufacturing)|sprue]] and [[Runner (casting)|runner]] systems into a heated cavity where the vulcanization takes place. The cold runner and general cooling results in minimal loss of material as the injection occurs directly into the part or cavity, saving on overall material costs and using high consistency rubber.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.etiroltec.com/liquid-injection-molding.html|title=Liquid Injection Molding|last=|first=|date=|website=Elastomer Technologies|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cooling allows production of LSR parts with nearly zero material valve gate waste, however this does not guarantee a "flash free" finished part. Molds and tooling are varying in design, execution and cost. A good cold runner is expensive as compared to conventional hot runner tooling, and has the potential to provide a high level of performance.

Retrieved on April 28, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The IASB was founded on April 1, 2001, as the successor to
the [[International Accounting Standards Committee]] (IASC). It is responsible for developing [[International Financial Reporting Standards]] (IFRS), previously known as [[International Accounting Standards]] (IAS) and promoting the use and application of these standards.

== Foundation ==
On December 31, 1920, The International Accounting Standards Foundation (IASF) was incorporated as a tax-exempt organization in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Delaware]].&lt;ref&gt;File No. 3348349&lt;/ref&gt; On February 6, 2001, the [[IFRS Foundation|International Financial Reporting Standards Foundation]] was also incorporated as a tax-exempt organization in Delaware.&lt;ref&gt;File No. 3353113&lt;/ref&gt; The IFRS Foundation is an independent, not-for-profit organisation. Its primary mission is to develop, in the public interest, a single set of high-quality, understandable, enforceable and globally accepted [[International Financial Reporting Standards]] (IFRS) based upon clearly articulated principles.&lt;ref name="About us"&gt;[http://www.ifrs.org/About-us/Pages/IFRS-Foundation-and-IASB.aspx "Mission Statement"]. ''IFRS ''. &lt;/ref&gt;

IFRS are developed by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), the independent standard-setting body of the IFRS Foundation.&lt;ref name="About us"/&gt; The IASB assumed accounting standard-setting responsibilities from its predecessor body, the [[International Accounting Standards Committee]] (IASC), on March 1, 2001. This was the culmination of a restructuring based on the recommendations of the report ''Recommendations on Shaping IASC for the Future''.

The IASB forms part the three-tier structure employed by the IFRS Foundation and is responsible for setting the IFRS and related technical activities. The IASB is overseen by the Trustees of the IFRS Foundation, responsible for the organisation's governance, the appointment of IASB members and funding. The IFRS Foundation is publicly accountable to a Monitoring Board&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iasplus.com/en/resources/ifrsf/governance/monitoring-board "Monitoring Board"]. ''Deloitte Global Services Limited''. 30 August 2012. &lt;/ref&gt; of capital market authorities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ifrs.org/About-us/Pages/How-we-are-structured.aspx "How we are structured"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140803030157/http://www.ifrs.org/About-us/Pages/How-we-are-structured.aspx |date=2014-08-03 }}.

''Deloitte Global Services Limited''. 30 August 2012. &lt;/ref&gt;

== Members ==
The IASB originally had 13 full-time Board members, each with one vote.&lt;ref name=members&gt;[http://www.ifrs.org/About-us/IASB/Members/Pages/Members-of-the-IASB.aspx "Members of the IASB"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140803032338/http://www.ifrs.org/About-us/IASB/Members/Pages/Members-of-the-IASB.aspx |date=2014-08-03 }}.

In 2008, American companies gave £2.4 million, more than those of any other country. However, contributions fell in the wake of the [[financial crisis of 2007–2010]], and a shortfall was reported in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accountancyage.com/accountancyage/news/2260848/lehman-collapse-contributed Lehman collapse contributed to IASB funding issues], ''Accountancy Age'', 6 Apr 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Academics such as Oxford professor [[Karthik Ramanna]] have criticized this arrangement as facilitating regulatory capture.&lt;ref&gt;Ramanna, K.

'''Joseph (Joe) F. Berardino''' (born 1950) is an American businessman, [[Certified Public Accountant]], and managing director at [[Alvarez and Marsal]]. Beradino was formerly managing partner and CEO of [[Arthur Andersen]] and chairman and CEO of Profectus Bioscience.

==Career==

===Arthur Andersen===
Berardino joined the [[Big Four auditors|Big 5 accounting firm]] [[Arthur Andersen]]'s [[New York City]] office in 1972, after graduating from the [[Fairfield University Dolan School of Business]] with a B.S. in Accounting. He was admitted to the partnership in 1982, rising to head of Andersen's U.S. audit practice.

In 1998, then [[United States Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC) Chairman [[Arthur Levitt]] launched an attack on the auditing business. At that time, it was felt that accounting firms were conflicted by selling consulting services to the same companies whose books they were auditing. In 2000, Berardino negotiated a compromise with the SEC. Auditing and consulting fees would henceforth be disclosed. At Andersen, Berardino was admired for having negotiated this compromise, because a prohibition from signing consulting contracts with audit clients would have been very damaging to Andersen's business. Levitt praised Berardino's leadership in his book ''Take on the Street...''.

Berardino became Managing Partner - Chief Executive Officer of Andersen Worldwide (the governing body of Andersen's operations in 84 countries including 85,000 people) in January 2001 shortly after its split with Andersen Consulting (Accenture). When Andersen's client [[Enron]] declared [[bankruptcy]] in the highly publicized [[Enron scandal]], Berardino appeared before Congress and announced a series of steps to improve Andersen and the accounting profession. In early 2002, when Andersen discovered that its auditors had been involved with shredding documents related to the Enron audit, Berardino disclosed this activity voluntarily to the U.S. Department of Justice and the SEC. While in Tokyo meeting with Asia-Pacific partners in an attempt to keep the firm together, Berardino received the news that the U.S. [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] was likely to [[indict]] the firm.

Berardino hired former [[Federal Reserve]] Chairman [[Paul Volcker]] in February 2002 to create an independent oversight board and reform Andersen into a pure auditing business. On March 14, 2002, the Justice Department indicted Andersen for obstruction of justice based on the document shredding which took place.

Initially, the firm's 18-strong Board of Partners asked Berardino to stay on. He resigned on March 26, 2002, in the hope that Justice would reconsider the indictment. They did not, and Andersen was convicted of [[obstruction of justice]] on June 15, 2002. By the end of August, it surrendered its licenses to audit public companies in the US.

In 2006, the [[Supreme Court of the U.S.]] overturned this conviction in a unanimous opinion. It was a symbolic victory for the defunct accounting firm.

===Profectus BioScience===
He was Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Profectus BioSciences in [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]] up until January 24, 2008. Berardino continued with the company as a Director through 2010. He had joined the company as a Director in 2004. 
Profectus Biosciences, Inc. is a biotechnology start-up that develops therapeutic and vaccine technologies intended to reduce the morbidity and mortality caused by viral diseases. The company’s near-term target is the [[Human Immunodeficiency Virus]] (HIV). On the vaccine front, Profectus is trying to target HIV as it attempts to enter a cell. The company’s therapies aim to cool the body’s overheated immune system after it is infected with HIV. Profectus is a [[Research spin-off|spin-off]] from the [[Institute of Human Virology]] and was created to commercialize its work.

===Alvarez &amp; Marsal===
Berardino is currently a Managing Director (since 2008) in charge of the Eastern region in the Business Consulting practice at [[Alvarez and Marsal]]. He also serves on the board of the firm's European Consulting Services practice.

===Affiliations===
Berardino  serves on the Boards of Directors of Quiksilver (NYSE:ZQK) since 2011; ValueVision Media (aka ShopHQ from 2008-2012; NASDAQ:VVTV) and Neuberger Berman from 2011 to 2012 and has served for eighteen years on the Board of Trustees of [[Fairfield University]]. 
In 2001, he received Fairfield University’s Beta Alpha Sigma Award, as well as a Doctor of Law, Honoras Causas, from the University of the East in the Philippines. 
In 2004 Berardino was invested as a [[Sovereign Military Order of Malta|Knight of Malta]].

[[File:50th-logo.png|thumbnail|H.E. Juma Al Majid]]
'''Juma al Majid''' (born in [[Dubai]], United Arab Emirates around 1930) is an Emirati businessman, political adviser, and philanthropist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Dubai: The Vulnerability of Success |last=Davidson |first=Christopher M. |page=156 |year=2009 |publisher=[[Columbia University Press]] |isbn=978-0-231-70035-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Al Majid is ranked among the Richest Arabs in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forbesmiddleeast.com/en/lists/people/pname/juma-al-majid/pid/13171/|title=The World's Richest Arabs|publisher=|accessdate=23 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
H.E. Juma Majid was born in Al Shandagah, Dubai in 1930.

Majid was introduced to the grocery business in Dubai through his uncle and continued in the same business for another two to three years until he met [[Mohammad Al Gaz]] in 1952. Al Gaz brought goods in Dubai from Kuwait and Bahrain, and Al Majid would help with the sales. In 1956, Al Qaz asked Al Majid to travel with him to Kuwait to trade in that lucrative market. The two used to take tobacco and Omani dry lime to sell in Kuwait and Bahrain and returned with goods like fabric and watches — from Switzerland and France — to sell in Dubai. The business expanded to Pakistan, India and across the Arab world into Europe, as it began to attract the support of international brands planning to enter the then [[Trucial States]]. It was around that time that Al Majid formally launched his own companies, Mohammad &amp; Juma Al Majid alongside Al Gaz's United Arab Agencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gulfnews.com/business/sectors/features/juma-al-majid-a-life-in-service-1.717158|title=A Life in Service|publisher=Gulf News|accessdate=12 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of the fifties, he participated with his colleagues: Mr. Humaid Al Tayer, Abdullah Al Ghurair, Nasir Rashed Loutah, and with consent of Sheikh [[Rashid bin Saeed Al Maktoum]] in the establishment of the first charitable society to help the needy of Dubai, so they established two secondary schools, one for boys in [[Bur Dubai]], called Jamal Abdul Nasser Secondary School, the second for girls in Bur Deira, called Amna Secondary Schools.

The partnership between Al Majid and Al Qaz lasted 11 years.

After the UAE Federation was formed, Al Majid left the gold business as the trade and development projects the country offered greater opportunities.

In 1974, Al Gaz and Al Majid began work on establishing a [[Pepsi]] factory in Dubai, the National Cement Company, and the [[Dubai Chamber of Commerce and Industry]]. He also diversified into the carpentry and décor business. The group has since diversified further into transport and logistics, construction, food and advertising. There is also an international investment company, Al Majid Investment.

Majid established the Islamic and Arabic Studies College in 1987 in Dubai.

In 1990, Al Majid, along with Al Gaz and other local philanthropists, established the Beit Al Khair Society, a charitable organization aims to aid the poor citizens, needy students, as well as offering cash or commodities to the victims of disasters.

In 1991, Al Majid realized the needs of scholars and researchers, especially those who are unable to obtain the necessary books, references and manuscripts, so he established a public library, afterwards it was developed to become a cultural organization, known as Juma Al Majid Center for Culture and Heritage.

Over time, Al Majid went on to secure franchise rights for other international brands — in engineering, automobiles, office furniture, communication and tyres — from companies like [[Samsung]], [[Hyundai]], [[Hitachi]] and many more. He is succeeded by his heir [[Khalid Juma Al Majid]].

Media5-fone is developed by Media5, a [[VoIP]] company based in [[Sherbrooke]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work =Life Wire|title =Media5 Phone and SIP App for iOS and Android |url =https://www.lifewire.com/media5-phone-and-sip-app-3426885 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work =El Tiempo|title =Tres aplicaciones para servicio de ETAPA|url =http://www.eltiempo.com.ec/noticias/cuenca/2/398668/tres-aplicaciones-para-servicio-de-etapa }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Details==
Media5-fone has now been withdrawn from service. https://documentation.media5corp.com/display/MOBP/Media5-fone

It relies on the portable M5T SIP Client Engine ([[Session Initiation Protocol|SIP stack]]). It is currently available on the [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] [[mobile operating system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.onsip.com/voip-phone-reviews/media5-fone |title=pretty much everything you need in a business SIP client}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The first [[IOS version history|iOS]] version of Media5-fone was released in June 2009. It was built to run iPhone and iPod devices on [[IOS version history|iOS]] 3, a non [[Multi-tasking]] operating system. Most [[IP PBX]] systems and [[Internet telephony service provider]] were compatible with the softclient. After this initial release, multiple features upgrade were made; [[VPN]] support, configurable ring-tone, Bluetooth, SIP-URI, and compatibility improvements.
 
In January 2010, Media5-fone was released on the [[Ovi store#Ovi Store|OVI Store]] for the Nokia Smartphones running the [[S60 (software platform)|S60]] 3rd [[Symbian]] Operating System. This edition survived a short period of time because of the [[S60 (software platform)|S60]] deprecation.
 
In mid 2010, Apple released [[IOS version history|iOS]] 4 and its [[Multi-tasking]] support. Media5-fone has since been able to run in the background while another app was in the foreground. This brought the [[iOS]] edition of the softclient on even ground with the [[Symbian]] OS that already supported [[Multi-tasking]].
 
In February 2011, [[Secure Real-time Transport Protocol|SRTP]], [[SDES]] and [[Transport Layer Security|TLS]] were added as additional features. In September 2011, Media5-fone was released on the Android Market (today [[Google Play]]). Since 2012, minor improvements were made and a new edition (Media5-fone MPS) supporting remote [[Provisioning|Device Provisioning]] was released. The MPS has also been made available on the [[Amazon Appstore]] with the support of [[Kindle Fire]] devices. Media5 Corporation is currentky developing the Media5-RCS app, a VoIP Softclient that supports [[Rich Communication Services]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work =Onsip |title =Media5-Fone |url =https://www.onsip.com/voip-phone-reviews/media5-fone }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Compatibility==
Media5-fone works with Penytel, Maxo and others. A list of preconfigured [[IP PBX]] systems and [[Internet telephony service provider]] is offered in the application.

Sir [[Richard John Roberts]] is the company’s Chief Scientific Officer.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://blogs.wsj.com/cio/2014/04/24/the-morning-download-tech-giants-act-to-stop-next-heartbleed/ |publisher=Wall Street Journal |date=April 24, 2014 |title=The Morning Download: Tech Giants Act to Stop ‘Next Heartbleed’ |author=Michael Hickens}}&lt;/ref&gt; He shared the 1993 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with [[Phillip Allen Sharp]] for the discovery of introns in eukaryotic DNA and the mechanism of gene-splicing.

In 2015, NEB committed to establishing a [[Good manufacturing practice|GMP]] manufacturing facility near its headquarters in Ipswich, Massachusetts; the aim is to be fully validated and operational by 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

==Partnerships==
In 2001, NEB co-founded the marine DNA library Ocean Genome Legacy (OGL), which according to the ''Boston Globe'', “catalogues samples of organisms from all over the world, to be made available to scientists for research”. Though originally located on the NEB campus, OGLF relocated to the Nahant campus of [[Northeastern University]] in 2014.&lt;ref name="Genome Web"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rodney H.

'''Occupation of factories''' is a method of the [[workers' movement]] used to prevent [[lock out]]s. They may sometimes lead to "recovered factories", in which the [[workers' self-management|workers self-manage]] the [[factories]].

They have been used in many [[strike action]]s, including:

*the 1920–22 ''[[Biennio rosso|Biennio Rosso]]'' (in particular the [[Turin factory occupation of 1920]])
*[[1936 French general strike]] (see [[1936 Matignon agreements]])
*in the [[May 68 revolts]], supported by the [[Council for Maintaining the Occupations]]
*in the 1970s in Italy (35-day occupation of the [[Fiat]])
*upper Clyde shipbuilder workers staged a work-in during 1971-72 with about 260 further occupations in Britain in the following decade
*the [[1971 Harco work-in]], Australia
*[[Uruguay general strike, 1973|1973 Uruguayan general strike]]
*[[Lip factory]] in France in 1973
*the occupation of the ceramics factory formerly known as Zanon in Argentina starting in 2001, that under workers' control changed its name to [[FaSinPat]]
*the occupation of the [[Republic Windows and Doors]] factory in Chicago in 2008, and the re-occupation of the factory in 2012
*A 77-day occupation of the [[SsangYong Motor Company|Ssangyong]] car factory in 2009&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/8187542.stm |title=S Korea factory occupation ends |publisher=BBC News |date=2009-08-06 |accessdate=2010-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Current occupation of Viomichaniki Metalleutiki in [[Thessaloniki]], [[Greece]], along the lines of factory occupations in Argentina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thenation.com/article/greek-workers-take-over-factory-video-interview/|title=Greek Workers Take Over a Factory [Video Interview]|first=Laura|last=Flanders|publisher=|via=www.thenation.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biennio Rosso ==
Radical unionism started after the first world war. The movement was a result of increasing internal commissions or "faculty councils". Around November 1918, the councils/commissions had morphed into a national problem. By February 1919, the federation of Italian metal workers had successfully received a contract permitting these commissions in their factories. In May 1919, these commissions began to transfer into councils that were managing the factories and were dominating the power structure of said workplaces. The contract also prevented democratic elections of these council members or "stewards". In April 1920, at Fiat, there was the beginning of sit-in strikes by the workers, which eventually grew to 500,000 workers striking at its peak.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://libcom.org/history/articles/italy-factory-occupations-1920|title=1918-1921: The Italian factory occupations and Biennio Rosso|website=libcom.org|access-date=2016-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The French General Strike ==
In France in January 1936, the PCF, a Stalinist communist organization spurred the creation of a coalition of radicals called the "popular front". This organization was designed to defend democracy and disassemble fascist bonds. In May 1936, the popular front won a majority election and assembled a cabinet of eighteen socialist, thirteen radicals and four independent socialist to govern. Communists supported the leaderrLeon Blum but refused to join the cabinet. This change in power was spurred by a massive general strike in the years preceding where thousands of factories had been occupied by French workers to ensure said democratic governance. Blum effectively ended the strike when this government came to power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.workersliberty.org/node/6469|title=1936: “The French revolution has begun”|last=B|first=Simon|website=Workers' Liberty|access-date=2016-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== May 68 Revolution ==
During a period of civil unrest in France in the 1960s, student protests were joined by factory occupations and strikes by French workers. See [[May 1968 events in France]].

== Fiat Occupation in Italy ==
In the 1960s, a historic movement of strikes and factory occupations had a significant effect on Italy. After constant failure by the government to follow through on promises for reform in Italy, a surge of uprising and strikes occurred between 1968 and 1970. Earlier strikes at northern factories in Turin were successful in gaining momentum in 1962. The Lancia factory walkout was successful in gaining some workers rights. The Michelin Factory strike around the same time had less success. A large strike in Turin however, amassing 93,000 of the Fiat workforce for a massive walkout and intimidation of those who did not participate. After further political negotiation and action through the years that followed, and unsatisfactory changes in policy coupled with increasingly educated and aware workers, the series of massive strikes broke out in 1968. The autumn of 1969 is considered the climax of these strikes and they continued through the early 1970s resulting in significantly improved conditions for Italian workers. In 1973, over 6 million workers were on strike.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://libcom.org/history/1962-1973-worker-student-struggles-italy|title=1962-1973: Worker and student struggles in Italy|website=libcom.org|access-date=2016-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Upper Clyde Ship Builder Work-In ==
The Upper Clyde Ship Builders are a Scottish shipbuilder consortium that was birthed in 1968 by an adjoining of 5 shipbuilders. It was liquidated in 1971 resulting in occupation/work-in campaign by shop stewards in shipyards. See [[Upper Clyde Shipbuilders]].

== Harco Work-In ==
The Harco work-in of 1971 was an occupation by steel plant workers in New South Wales, Australia. The 4-week long work-in was the result of a dispute between Harco owners and workers on company sacking and rehiring practices during low production periods to save money. See [[1971 Harco work-in]].

== Uruguayan General Strike ==
During 1973, a close of parliament and essential dictatorship by the president created unrest and the leftist union called for a general strike and occupation of factories. After two weeks most of the union leaders were in jail, exile, or dead. See [[1973 Uruguayan general strike]].

== French LIP Factory ==
When the LIP factory in France decided to close a factory due to financial problems in the late 60s and early 70s, strikes and a very public factory occupation eventually transferred control and management of the factory to the workers. See [[LIP (company)]]

== Zanon Factory Occupation ==
During the Argentine uprising of the early 2000s, there was a complete takeover of the Zanon tile factory in Argentina. The workers went on strike in the year 2000, the first of a series of strikes that was spurred by the death of a worker from a heart attack. They also were adamant about making their conflicts with the company very public. Workers traveled and occupied places other than factories as well. In January 2001, there was a 6-day strike over unpaid wages. In April 2001, there was a 34-day strike over outstanding wages. These strikes were followed by many other occupations and strikes that ultimately cause the factories to lose almost 50% of their production.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://libcom.org/library/zanon-factory-occupation-interview-with-workers|title=Zanon factory occupation - interview with workers|website=libcom.org|access-date=2016-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Republic Windows and Doors Occupation ==
When Republic Windows and Doors company was declared bankrupt in December 2008, an organized sit-own strike of 200 workers in the factory occurred to protest federal labor law violations by the company.

== Ssangyong Car Factory Occupation ==
A long occupation of the Ssangyong car factory by 900 factory workers and several thousand others began on May 22, 2009 after a list of firings was released by the company that showed over 1000 workers to be laid off. This was the result of the company filing for bankruptcy in February 2009. Workers were essentially sieged by the company during their occupation and workers refused all company negotiations that did not include jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2009/07/kore-j01.html|title=South Korea: Clashes erupt at Ssangyong factory occupation - World Socialist Web Site|last=Cook|first=Terry|website=www.wsws.org|access-date=2016-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13081">The '''Olympics Triplecast''' was an experimental [[pay-per-view]] telecast in the [[United States of America|United States]] during the [[1992 Summer Olympics]] in [[Barcelona]], Spain. While an ambitious project, it was a massive financial failure.

==Overview and history==
[[NBC]], which had broadcast rights to the Games,&lt;ref group=Note name=Note01/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://jeff560.tripod.com/tv8.html | title= TV Broadcasting History – The World Comes Together in Your Living Room: The Olympics on TV| first= Joseph |last= Gallant | accessdate= 6 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; thought that viewers would be willing to pay US$95 to $170 to see events live, which would normally be shown on [[broadcast delay|tape delay]] on the network in [[prime time]]. It partnered with [[Cablevision]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nbcsports.com/our-history#decade_7|title=The 1992 Barcelona Olympics|last= |first= |date= |website=NBC Sports History Page|publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the prominent New York cable provider, to create three channels: Red, White, and Blue.  A special three-button [[remote control]] with the colors of the channels as the buttons was offered by some cable operators for free as a lure to sign up for the service.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20081010040835/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb4895/is_199201/ai_n17999082 Article] at findarticles.com&lt;/ref&gt; Channels aired twelve hours a day (from 5 a.m. to 5 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|ET]]) then repeated their content for the other twelve hours.&lt;ref name="nyt71792"&gt;"Triplecast Ads Are Cited." ''New York Times'' 17 Jul. 1992: 10.&lt;/ref&gt; Programs came from the world feed.&lt;ref&gt;Sarni, Jim. [http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1992-07-27/news/9202210808_1_triplecast-click-balance-beam "Quick Remote Trigger Is A Triplecast Must"], ''Miami Sun-Sentinel'', 27 July 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;  As an inducement for people to order the Triplecast, NBC featured star announcers and pundits, such as [[Chick Hearn]] for basketball.  This was nothing new for NBC as the network employed [[Vin Scully]] for its [[World Series]] telecasts.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCkYon5qjWI&lt;/ref&gt;

===Channel programs===
* The Blue channel featured [[Swimming at the 1992 Summer Olympics|swimming]] events during the first week and [[Athletics at the 1992 Summer Olympics|track and field]] events during the second week. 
* The White channel featured many individual sports, such as [[Gymnastics at the 1992 Summer Olympics|gymnastics]], [[Boxing at the 1992 Summer Olympics|boxing]], [[Rowing at the 1992 Summer Olympics|rowing]], [[Equestrian at the 1992 Summer Olympics|equestrian]] and other minor sports.
* The Red channel featured team sports, such as [[Boxing at the 1992 Summer Olympics|basketball]], [[Baseball at the 1992 Summer Olympics|baseball]], [[Volleyball at the 1992 Summer Olympics|volleyball]], [[Water polo at the 1992 Summer Olympics|water polo]], and [[Handball at the 1992 Summer Olympics|team handball]].

==Issues==
Several issues plagued the Triplecast.

===Logistics===
Cable providers took a lower profit cut than they normally do for pay-per-view events. A national center was also set up (1-800-OLYMPIC) to take calls, but it often had trouble telling if a viewer's cable system was participating. In January 1992, for instance, [[Chuck Dolan]], head of Cablevision, tested the ordering system, which could not tell if his Cablevision Long Island system was carrying the Triplecast.&lt;ref name="nyt62992"&gt;Sandomir, Richard. [https://www.nytimes.com/1992/06/29/sports/olympics-triplecast-an-olympian-blunder-or-innovation.html "OLYMPICS; Triplecast: An Olympian Blunder or Innovation?"], ''The New York Times'', 29 June 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Low uptake===
The biggest issue with ''Triplecast'' was low uptake. NBC estimated two million people would subscribe to the programming.&lt;ref name="time"&gt;Zoglin, Richard; Ty, William. "How Much Is Too Much?" ''TIME'' 10 Aug. 1992: 64.&lt;/ref&gt; But ''TripleCast'' projections were around 200,000-250,000, and the ''Pay-Per-View Update'' industry newsletter estimated only 125,000. Early reports of slow sales even inspired [[David Letterman]], then still at NBC, to make jokes about the ''Triplecast''.&lt;ref name="time"/&gt; Midway through the games, discounts were applied for one-day service and weekend packages were added. But the attempts to boost subscription largely failed. Another attempt to boost interest was made, by airing a three-way [[split screen (film)|split screen]] of the ''TripleCast'' channels in hour-long blocks on [[CNBC]], but with no audio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://sportsrantz.com/media/2012/07/25/olympics-triplecast/| title= 20 Years After: The Olympics Triplecast| author= Diamond Joe |date= 25 July 2012 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120804160207/http://sportsrantz.com/media/2012/07/25/olympics-triplecast/| deadurl= yes| accessdate= 6 July 2015| archivedate= 4 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The final tally of ''Olympics Triplecast'' subscribers was 200,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://london2012.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/07/25/happy-anniversary-triplecast/ | title= Happy Anniversary, Triplecast | last= Sandomir| first= Richard| date= 25 July 2012| work= The New York Times ''blog''| accessdate= 6 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was enough of a flop that Chuck Dolan was already acknowledging by August 6 that "the public didn't find enough incremental value for the ''Triplecast'' over what they could get on NBC" and that "we blew it from an economic point of view." It also surfaced that research figures were enhanced. While one percent of surveyed viewers said they would "definitely" buy the ''TripleCast'', that number was enhanced in press materials by adding those who declared they would "probably" buy the service.&lt;ref name="sandomir8692"&gt;Sandomir, Richard. "BARCELONA; Overpricing of Olympics' Triplecast Service Is Acknowledged", ''The New York Times'' 6 Aug. 1992: 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cannibalizing the main coverage===
The TripleCast service took a very austere, no-frills approach to broadcasting that included play-by-play and commentary, but few graphics and absolutely no feature stories or background vignettes. According to some TripleCast viewers, this made the main NBC coverage seem "schmaltzy and overproduced".&lt;ref name="time"/&gt; In addition, NBC's main coverage was denigrated to some extent, with Triplecast viewers knowing some results 10 hours or more before the events were aired on the main network.

===Advertising===
Original Triplecast advertising promoted that the service was "live with no interruptions" — though half of the broadcast day was a repeat. The New York City Consumer Affairs Department charged NBC and Cablevision with deception in advertising as a result.&lt;ref name="nyt71792"/&gt; Eventually, the parties settled, with NBC and Cablevision agreeing to clarify the advertising.&lt;ref&gt;"OLYMPICS; Settlement In Triplecast Ads." ''The New York Times'' 22 July 1992: 10.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, about 10 percent of NBC's 205 affiliates refused to run Triplecast advertising because they did not want to promote competition for their broadcast.&lt;ref name="nyt62992"/&gt;

==Legacy==
Even before the Olympics started, many criticized the business model. On July 16, nine days before the Opening Ceremony, one ''[[Philadelphia Inquirer]]'' writer called it "the biggest marketing disaster since [[New Coke]]".&lt;ref&gt;Macnow, Glen. [http://articles.philly.com/1992-07-16/sports/26025616_1_nbc-s-triplecast-nbc-chief-executive-olympic-coverage-nbc "Triplecast May Be A National Failure At This Year's Games NBC Needs A Huge Viewing Audience To Make Its $401 Million Gamble On The Olympics Pay Off. So Far, It's Not Even Close."], ''Philadelphia Inquirer'', 16 July 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; The Triplecast was deemed by ''[[The New York Times]]'' "sports TV's biggest flop" and that NBC and Cablevision were "bereft in sanity" in operating it.&lt;ref&gt;Sandomir, Richard. "Click, Click, Click: The Year In Gaffes", ''The New York Times'' 25 December 1992: 8.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1994, it was referred to as "the ''[[Heaven's Gate (film)|Heaven's Gate]]'' of television".&lt;ref&gt;Sandomir, Richard. "SPORTS BUSINESS; Some Shaky Precedents for New York Sports Fans." ''New York Times'' 28 Aug. 1994: 35.&lt;/ref&gt; Albert Kim, the editor of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', went on [[National Public Radio]] and called it "an unmitigated disaster for NBC".&lt;ref&gt;DePrez, Greg. [http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-18601621.html "The Olympics TripleCast: still revolutionary, still relevant"], ''Multichannel News'' 22 June 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; It was a loss of about $100 million (half of which was covered by Cablevision under agreement) for the two parties. It also shaped NBC's strategies in the coverage of future Olympics.

NBC did not use pay-per-view to cover any future games. While NBC alone broadcast the [[1996 Summer Olympic Games]] in the United States, NBC decided to use [[cable television]] partners for its subsequent telecasts. [[Olympics on CBS|CBS]], which had the broadcast rights to the [[1994 Winter Olympic Games|1994]] and [[1998 Winter Olympic Games]], also used a cable partner, [[Olympics on TNT|TNT]].

*[[CNBC]] and [[MSNBC]] showed the [[2000 Summer Olympics|2000 Summer Games]] and [[2002 Winter Olympic Games|2002 Winter Games]] along with NBC, and three newer acquisitions ([[Bravo (US TV network)|Bravo]] and [[USA Network]] in English and [[Telemundo]] in Spanish) joined the coverage for the [[2004 Summer Olympics|2004 Summer Games]]. [[Universal HD]] was added for the [[2006 Winter Olympics|2006 Winter Games]]. This arrangement continued, with [[Oxygen (TV network)|Oxygen]] taking the place of Bravo for the 2008 Games, and excluded from the 2010 Games due to a lack of programming (NBC's digital subchannel [[Universal Sports]] began to air analysis shows during those Games). The [[NBC Sports Network]] showed all U.S. Olympic events in the [[2012 Olympic Games]].
*For the [[2008 Summer Olympics]], NBC offered to cable operators the NBC Olympic Basketball Channel and NBC Olympic Soccer Channel, which broadcast exclusively in [[high definition television|high definition]] and aired all the events in both sports without any commercial interruptions. During halftimes and before each game, a wide-angle shot of the venue from the default world feed was shown instead along with highlights without commentary, while non-programming hours consisted of rolling statistics or a [[test pattern]]; later years now feature a continuous loop of the previous day's action.

*During the 2008 Summer Olympics, NBC also streamed 2,200 hours of 25 different sports live on [http://www.nbcolympics.com NBCOlympics.com]. Most events shown on NBCOlympics.com were shown with no commentary. The number of hours of coverage has expanded further for each succeeding Games.
*For the 2018 Winter Olympics, the addition of the new [[Olympic Channel (United States)|Olympic Channel]] will allow further expansion overall to the network's schedule of coverage.

NBC currently holds the U.S. rights to the Olympics through 2032.

==Notes==
{{reflist|group=Note|refs=
&lt;ref name=Note01&gt;By 1992, televising the Olympics had become a costly proposition. NBC won the rights to the Summer Games in Barcelona with a bid of $401 million, thinking ABC and CBS were both going to bid $400 million each (in the end, the highest rival bid was closer to $ 300 million). In an attempt to recoup the cost, NBC decided, in addition to its own extensive over-the-air TV coverage, to partner with Cablevision Systems Corporation (who were joint owners of [[Rainbow Programming Holdings]], parent company to several cable networks) and produce round-the-clock (twelve hours live each day, then repeated for the next twelve hours) coverage of other Olympic events on three pay-per-view channels. The venture was a financial disaster, with NBC and Cablevision each losing about $50 million each.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

PROGNOZ was founded as the result of a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]-era collaboration between the Russian Academy of Science and the Ministry of the Economy.  In 1987, a team of economists and scientists from the Academy’s Institute of Economics gathered at Perm State University to conduct a series of economic forecasting projects for the Ministry.  Four years later, after the establishment of the Russian Federation opened the national economy, one of these economists, Dmitry L. Andrianov, founded PROGNOZ to address the need for business software that analyzed and forecast economic information.  (Andrianov continues to serve as PROGNOZ’s CEO today).  A year later, in 1992, PROGNOZ introduced the PROGNOZ Analytical Suite, a software application for statistical analysis and econometric modeling, and a predecessor to the PROGNOZ 5 Platform.  In 2001, PROGNOZ expanded its operations from Perm and opened an office in Moscow.  This expansion continued in 2006 with offices in Beijing, Philadelphia, Washington DC, Kiev and other locations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.prognoz.com|title = www.prognoz.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Peralta ramos.jpg|thumb|Patricio Peralta Ramos]]
'''Patricio Peralta Ramos''' (May 17, 1814{{spaced ndash}}April 25, 1887) was an Argentine businessman and landowner prominent in the foundation of the seaside city of [[Mar del Plata]].

==Life and times==
Patricio Peralta Ramos was born in the [[San Nicolás, Buenos Aires|San Nicolás]], a [[Buenos Aires]] neighbourhood, in 1814. His father, José de Peralta, was a high-ranking official of the [[1st Infantry Regiment (Argentina)|Patricios Regiment]]. In 1860, he married a distant relative, Cecilia Ramos, with whom he had twelve children.

Peralta Ramos became a large clothing supplier to the [[Argentine Army]] during the 1829-52 regime of Governor [[Juan Manuel de Rosas]], of whom Peralta Ramos became an official supporter in 1842. A wealthy man by the time of Rosas' overthrow at the 1852 [[Battle of Caseros]], he traveled in 1860 to the Atlantic Ocean shore, where he purchased over 136,000 hectares (340,000 acres) from [[Portugal|Portuguese]] Consul and entrepreneur José Coelho de Meyrelles, and a meat salting house.&lt;ref name=punto&gt;[http://www.puntomardelplata.com/historia-marplatense.asp ''Punto Mar del Plata: Reseña histórica marplatense'' {{es icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

His [[Jerky (food)|beef jerky]] facility struggling, Peralta Ramos embarked on the initial real estate development of his vast, scenic land. His enterprise met with the resistance of the gentry of [[Balcarce, Buenos Aires|Balcarce]] (then the county seat), though in 1865, he obtained a favorable ruling for the shoreline development from the local [[Justice of Peace]], Juan Peña. Seizing on a discrepancy between Peralta Ramos' holdings and what appeared in the official appraisal, Balcarce founder and Mayor José Chaves nearly forced his adversary to relocate his planned development on [[marshland]], but an 1867 letter in Peralta Ramos' support by neighboring [[Mar Chiquita]] Judge José Bernal to [[Buenos Aires Province]] official [[Nicolás Avellaneda]] settled the dispute in Peralta Ramos' favor.&lt;ref name=punto/&gt;
[[File:Playa Bristol - Mar del Plata- Ca 1910.jpg|left|thumb|232px|Mar del Plata's Bristol Beach, around 1910]]
Advertising the development as ''Puerto de la Laguna de los Padres,'' the sale of allotments was successful, and in 1873, Peralta Ramos petitioned the province for the seaside hamlet's incorporation, which was granted by Governor [[Mariano Acosta (politician)|Mariano Acosta]] on February 10, 1874, as ''Puerto Balcarce''. As this nomenclature was assigned over his objections, Peralta Ramos unofficially christened the community ''Mar del Plata'' (in the sense of "Sea of the [[Rio de la Plata basin|River Plate region]]").&lt;ref&gt;''Creemos, sin embargo, que por ser el primer contacto que los hombres del Río de la Plata tomaron con el mar se llamó a este punto precisamente mar "del Plata".''  Cova, Roberto Osvaldo:''Síntesis histórica de Mar del Plata: notas para el conocimiento del origen, evolución y desarrollo de la ciudad y de la zona.'' 1969, p. 8 {{es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The accomplishment was clouded, however, by the death of his wife, Cecilia, in honor of whom Peralta Ramos personally designed and built the [[Saint Cecilia]] Chapel; the structure, poignantly, was built by the mourning widower from wooden planks salvaged from a recent wreckage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.turismania.com.ar/DESCUBRA/pages/fundacion/fundacion.asp ''Turismania: Fundación de Mar del Plata'' {{es icon}}] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091008181100/http://www.turismania.com.ar/DESCUBRA/pages/fundacion/fundacion.asp |date=2009-10-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Boasting seaside appeal, an iron [[pier]] and made self-sufficient by the salting house, as well as by a flour mill, bakery, blacksmith and other establishments, the community prospered. In his later years, Peralta Ramos promoted the hunt of the area's then-vast herds of [[South American Sea Lion|sea lions]], which he termed "an inexhaustible source of wealth."&lt;ref&gt;''Centenario del natalicio del fundador de Mar del Plata Don Patricio Peralta Ramos.''&lt;/ref&gt;

He died in Mar del Plata in 1887, and his remains were buried initially at Saint Cecilia chapel and some years later reburied at the [[La Recoleta Cemetery]] in Buenos Aires.

'''''Pocket Planes''''' is a business [[simulation video game]] developed by [[NimbleBit]] for [[iOS]]. It was initially released on June 14, 2012. In October 2012, the game became available on the [[Mac App Store]]. An [[Android (operating system)|Android]] version, [[porting|ported]] and published by [[Mobage]], was released on September 22, 2012. The game was removed on September 24, 2015 from the [[Google Play|Google Play Store]] but is still available on [[App Store (iOS)|iOS App Store]]. The app has also been removed from the U.K. [[App Store (iOS)|iOS App Store]] but is still available on the U.S App Store.

==Gameplay==
[[File:Pocket Planes Gameplay Screenshot.jpg|thumb|A screenshot depicting a plane that has landed at an airport.|alt=A screenshot depicting a plane that has landed at an airport.|275x275px]]
In ''Pocket Planes'', players assume the role of an [[airline]] CEO. Starting with a few airports and small planes, players transport small amounts of [[cargo]] and [[passenger]]s short distances. As they slowly gain profit from their flights, they then build more airports, buy better planes, and expand their airline internationally.&lt;ref name=wiredrigneynofly&gt;{{cite web|last=Rigney|first=Ryan|title=Review: Pocket Planes‘ Airy Gameplay Doesn’t Fly|url=https://www.wired.com/gamelife/2012/06/review-pocket-planes-airy-gameplay-doesnt-fly/|work=Wired: Game{{!}}Life|publisher=Wired.com|accessdate=4 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A formula determines how much profit will be earned from a flight, depending on the distance, speed and the weight of the plane used on the route. Filling a plane with items or people going to the same destination will net a 25% bonus on each item. Players can also complete events that involve flying special items and people to a designated destination. After completing these events, players are awarded Bux, which are used to buy planes and purchase other perks such as upgrades and the ability to speed up flights.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

==Shutdown for Android==
On September 24, 2015, the company that ported the game to Android, [[Mobage]], shut down their game servers for Pocket Planes and other NimbleBit games including [[Pocket Frogs]] and [[Tiny Tower]], and subsequently removed these downloads from the [[Google Play Store]]. There are no plans to bring it back, and the data from the Android game cannot be transferred to the iOS version. NimbleBit has announced that future sequels or a major update may see a re-release for the game to Android.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://support.nimblebit.com/customer/en/portal/articles/2103500-android-version-shutdown|title=Android Version Shutdown|publisher=NimbleBit Support Center|date=4 October 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160505103256/http://support.nimblebit.com/customer/en/portal/articles/2103500-android-version-shutdown|archive-date=5 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://support.nimblebit.com/customer/en/portal/articles/2215443-where-did-pocket-planes-for-android-go-|title=Where Did Pocket Planes for Android Go?|publisher=NimbleBit Support Center}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''RCA Open-Source Application''' ('''ROSA''') is an [[open-source software|open-source]] management accounting application that aims to provide decision support information to managers. [[Resource consumption accounting]] (RCA) is a principle-based approach to [[management accounting]] that combines German management accounting techniques known as [[Grenzplankostenrechnung]] (GPK) with a disciplined form of activity-based costing.

ROSA uses resource consumption accounting (RCA) which is internationally recognized as the most robust form of cost management measurement for providing marginal cost analytics.&lt;ref&gt;[[International Federation of Accountants]] (IFAC) [http://web.ifac.org/publications/professional-accountants-in-business-committee/information-papers-1#evaluating-the-costing-jour|costing assessment of Resource Consumption Accounting]&lt;/ref&gt;

ROSA is classified as a non-web open-source application, bringing many of the key modeling techniques of the RCA model to life.  It provides a hands-on approach allowing the user complete interactive modeling capabilities. All the necessary files (databases, applications, manuals, storyboard etc.) as outlined in the bullet points below, have been collected into one compressed downloadable zip folder. The application uses [[Microsoft Excel]] as its primary interface, thus the learning curve is greatly accelerated due to the familiarity factor.

==Purpose of ROSA Project==
In 2009, it was determined that a hands-on RCA model would be an effective way to demonstrate how RCA works. The ROSA application answers this need, and was designed as an interactive tool to aid in better understanding the principles and costing approach of [[resource consumption accounting]]. ROSA should be viewed as a ''cost planning and analysis tool'' and not as a ''pricing/profitability application''.

The ROSA open-source package contains:
*''ROSA manual'' – To start the install process, double-click Autorun (Application) in the ROSA_USB compressed zip folder.
*''Palo For Excel installation file''
*''ROSA base model database'' (pre-configured model)
*''ROSA sample database'' (blank model)
*''Excel application file''
*''Visual Storyboard''
Note: The Palo BI Suite support material should be used in conjunction with the ROSA Manual where necessary, particularly in areas concerning Palo installation, set-up and operation.

==Features==
[[Image:ROSAfront.jpg|thumb|right|525px|''ROSA Copyright 2010 Alta Via Consulting, LLC'']]
ROSA uses the business intelligence (BI) application called [[Palo (OLAP database)|Palo]]. Palo allows the ROSA base model database to be pre-configured so that the user can explore the look and feel of how a RCA model functions.
{{Wikibooks|RCA Open Source Application: ROSA Manual}}

Some of the primary features of the RCA open-source application are:

*RCA modeling
**cost objects in an RCA model
**planning a cost object's output and primary costs
**relationships in an RCA model
**storyboard of a pharmaceutical company
*Analysis of
**product costs
**resource pools and business processes
**fixed and proportional rates
*Maintaining
**resource pools and business processes
**products
**primary costs
**secondary costs (internal consumption)
**capacity
**rate calculation
*Configuring
**importing of master data and planning data values

==Limitations==
There are certain cost modeling limitations inherent in the ROSA application. These limitations are specific to Version 1.0 of the ROSA application and should not be viewed as static. In other cases, customized versions of ROSA have been developed to fulfill client-specific requests addressing their firm’s individual costing requirements.

*''No ‘actual’ costs'' – ROSA is a stand-alone application and does not have integrated links to import data. It supports the construction of an RCA model for cost planning and analysis. ROSA does not currently support the comparison of actual to plan within the application.  The planning aspect allows for the definition of consumption relationships with operational resource quantities, valuing the resource quantities with dollars, and calculating product and service costs.
*''Excess/idle capacity'' – There is a limited ability to isolate excess/idle capacity in the application. The application currently deals only with planned information and is therefore not able to provide information on actual excess/idle capacity.
*''Model size limitation'' – The ROSA model was designed for optimum use for businesses with limited size RCA applications.  However, the underlying database and technology used in this model is extremely scalable.
*''No profitability reporting'' –  Rosa Version 1.0 is solely for the purposes of cost modeling. Customer or product revenue cannot be accommodated in this Version 1.0 of the application and reports on customer or product profitability are not provided.

To experience the full benefits that [[Resource Consumption Accounting]] has to offer as a dynamic, fully integrated, principle-based approach, a more robust and integrated software application must be used. The most widely used software applications for RCA are [[SAP AG]] ERP system and macs Controlling.

==Architecture==
This application uses an open-source [[Business intelligence]] software engine called [[Palo (OLAP database)]], published by [http://www.jedox.com/en/home/overview.html Jedox AG].  Palo has been designed as an [[Add-in]] to spreadsheet software (i.e., [[Microsoft Excel]]).

'''Samba Bathily''' is a [[Mali]]an [[entrepreneur]], [[philanthropist]] from [[Bamako]]. He is also [[chief executive officer]] of “Solektra International” and co-founder of [[Akon Lighting Africa]].

==Career ==
In 2014, Samba co-founded [[Akon Lighting Africa]]. This was launched with international music star Akon and Thione Niang.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/frontiers/2015/05/20/singer-akon-makes-progress-with-african-solar-power-venture/|title=Singer Akon Makes Progress With African Solar Power Venture|date=2015-05-20|accessdate=2015-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The objective of this initiative is to bring awareness around the use of solar solutions to provide villages throughout Africa with access to clean, renewable and reliable electricity. To date, results include a series of solar developments such as the installation of street lamps and domestic and community modern renewable energy solutions in 14 countries throughout Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=17&amp;v=MFPxL-Nz7fk|title=CNBC Africa - Akon to electrify Africa|date=2015-08-19|accessdate=2015-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also launched in 2014 was Solektra International, a company that specializes in the planning, design, construction and maintenance of solar power systems. Samba is CEO and Co-founder with Akon and Thione Niang.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://solektra-international.com/management-team/samba-bathily-profile/|title=Samba Bathily|date=2015|accessdate=2015-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Solektra has a B2G (Business to Government) financing model that offers attractive and affordable repayment terms. Solektra International is the execution arm of Akon Lighting Africa with a goal to use local youths to implement projects while also fast tracking the social and economic development of Africa in cooperation with various international partners. Solektra International currently has a presence in 14 countries - [[Mali]], [[Senegal]], [[Niger]], [[Benin]], [[Sierra Leone]], [[Burkina-Faso]], [[Guinea]], [[Equatorial Guinea]], [[Gabon]], [[Congo-Brazzaville]], [[Nigeria]], [[Madagascar]], [[Namibia]].

Samba is soon to launch the “Solektra Solar Academy” to provide a pipeline of trained youth where they will develop skills and expertise in the field of solar energy. To be launched late 2015, this professional training institute targets future African entrepreneurs, engineers and technicians and will provide training on aspects of planning, design, construction and the maintenance of solar-powered electric systems and micro-grids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2015/06/03/akon-lighting-africa-to-bring-electricity-to-600-million-_n_7500156.html|title=Akon Lighting Africa's Solar Academy Hopes To Bring Electricity To 600 Million People|date=2015-03-06|accessdate=2015-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prince '''Luigi Marcantonio Francesco Rodolfo Scipione Borghese''', commonly known as '''Scipione Borghese''' (11 September 1871, [[Migliarino]] – 18 November 1927, [[Florence]]), was an Italian aristocrat, industrialist, politician, explorer, mountain climber and racing driver belonging to the [[House of Borghese]].

He is best known for participating in (and winning) the [[Peking to Paris]] race in 1907, accompanied by the journalist [[Luigi Barzini Sr.]] and  Ettore Guizardi, the prince's chauffeur, who apparently did most of the driving.  Nevertheless, before 1907 he had already become known internationally as a traveller, explorer, diplomat and mountain climber.  In 1900 he had finished a journey in Asia from [[Beirut]] to the [[Pacific Ocean]]. His book ''In Asia: Siria, Eufrate, Babilonia'' (In Asia:  Syria, Euphrates, Babylon), published in 1903 and which proved a success, describes his journey from Beirut to Basra and the head of the Persian Gulf.  Subsequently he also completed a journey across China, recounted in another book.

Tall and abstemious, he was a man of few words, cold, with calm and measured manners, and with great self-control.  He was a [[Italian Chamber of Deputies|deputy]] of the [[Italian Radical Party|Partito Radicale]] in the [[Italian parliament]] of 1904 to 1913, fought bravely in the [[First World War]], and began important improvement works in the "[[Agro Romano]]".

==Family==
Borghese was the eldest son of Paolo, 9th Prince of Sulmona (1845–1920) and his wife Ilona, Countess Apponyi de Nagy-Appony. He was twice married, firstly to Anna Maria de Ferrari (23 March 1874 – 25 November 1924), daughter of Gaetano, duca di Ferrari by his wife Maria Annenkov, on 23 May 1895, and they had two daughters.  His second marriage to Teodora Martini on 8 August 1926 produced no issue.  He was succeeded in the title [[Prince of Sulmona]] by his brother Livio Borghese, 11th Prince of Sulmona (1874–1939), second son of the 9th Prince.

# [http://www.geneall.net/I/per_page.php?id=584804 Santa Borghese] (1 November 1897 Île de France, Paris – 13 April 1997 Rome). She married on 4 July 1925 at Isola Borghese, Lago di Garda, Astorre Hercolani, 9º principe Hercolani. They have 7 children with an A beginning surname. 
# [http://www.geneall.net/I/per_page.php?id=584806 Livia Borghese] (4 March 1901 Île de France, Paris  – 14 December 1969 Bologna, nine months after the death of her husband); she married on 30 December 1930 at Isola Borghese, Lago di Garda, Alessandro, conte Cavazza (1895–1969), by whom she had three sons (the eldest apparently born in 1922, or eight years before her marriage), and several descendants.

With respect to public companies in the United States, a '''shareholder resolution''' is a proposal submitted by [[shareholders]] for a vote at the company's annual meeting. Typically, resolutions are opposed by the corporation's management, hence the insistence for a vote. For publicly held corporations in the United States, the submission and handling of resolutions is regulated by the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC). 

[[Shareholders]] submit resolutions dealing primarily with [[corporate governance]], such as [[executive compensation]], or [[corporate social responsibility]] issues, such as [[global warming]], [[labor relations]], [[tobacco smoking]], [[human rights]], and animal welfare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://money.cnn.com/2006/04/25/magazines/fortune/pluggedin_fortune/|title=FORTUNE Magazine: Corporate America backs gay rights|accessdate=2008-03-09 | work=CNN | date=April 25, 2006 | first=Marc | last=Gunther}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Virtually all shareholder resolutions are non-binding (or "precatory," to use the legal term of art).&lt;ref&gt;Monks, Robert A. and Nell Minow. ''Corporate Governance''. Blackwell Publishers, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense the voting on these resolutions more closely resembles a poll than it does a (binding) [[referendum]] or [[plebiscite]]. Still, media coverage of voting on shareholder resolutions tends to focus on whether the proposal received a majority of votes, which occurs in a very small but increasing proportion of cases. According to SEC rules, defeated resolutions may be resubmitted only if they pass certain election hurdles (percentage of affirmative votes).  

Shareholder resolutions have been an important part of activist campaigns in several cases. For example, resolutions were effective at raising public awareness and thereby pressuring corporate management about investments in [[apartheid]] [[South Africa]], [[nuclear power]], and [[labor disputes]]. Given these results, resolutions have been spearheaded by several coordinating groups, including the [[AFL-CIO]] and the [[Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility]]. Governmental and labor union [[pension funds]] also have become involved in supporting and submitting shareholder resolutions.

A shareholder resolution to protest napalm manufacturer Dow Chemical resulted in a U.S. Supreme Court case called SEC v. MEDICAL COMMITTEE FOR HUMAN RIGHTS, 404 U.S. 403 (1972). The court decided that the case was moot due to Dow's agreeing to include the resolution on its proxy statement.&lt;ref name = scotus&gt;{{cite web|url=https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-supreme-court/404/403.html |title=Sec V. Medical Committee For Human Rights &amp;#124; Findlaw |publisher=Caselaw.findlaw.com |date= |accessdate=2016-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dissent argument by Justice Douglas encourages the SEC to facilitate more shareholder resolutions. "The philosophy of our times, I think, requires that such [404 U.S. 403, 410]  enterprises be held to a higher standard than that of the "morals of the marketplace" which exalts a single-minded, myopic determination to maximize profits as the traditional be-all and end-all of corporate concern." &lt;ref name = scotus/&gt;

'''Soda Industry Inc.'''  ({{lang-tr|Soda Sanayii A.Ş.}}, also called Sodakrom) is a chemical company in [[Mersin]], [[Turkey]] producing soda ash and chromium compounds mainly for the glass industry in its parent's group of companies. It is owned and operated by the Şişecam Group.

The soda plant at {{coord|36|48|51|N|34|44|55|E}} is to the west of [[Kazanlı]] neighborhood in [[Akdeniz]] district of Mersin, southern Turkey.

==History==
The Soda Industry Inc. was established in 1969 as a subsidiary of the Şişecam Group, Turkey's major glass producer. Production of soda ash ([[sodium carbonate]], [[sodium|Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]][[carbon|C]][[oxygen|O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]]), a key raw material for the [[glass industry]], began in 1975.&lt;ref name="scc"/&gt;

In 1979, the Kromsan Chromium Compounds Plant ({{lang-tr|Kromsan Krom Bileşikleri Fabrikası}}) was founded.&lt;ref name="sck"/&gt; It is situated just to the northwest of the Soda Plant. In 1982, it joined the Şişecam Chemicals Group, one of the four main businesses of Şişecam Group.&lt;ref name="scc"/&gt; In 1986, Kromsan merged with the  Soda Industry company.&lt;ref name="sck"/&gt;

Beginning by 1997, Soda Industry began foreign investments. Soda Industry acquired  25% share of the Bulgarian Soda factory Sodi in 1997 and all shares of the Bosnian soda factory Lukavac in 2006 to increase its soda production. In 2011 Soda Industry also acquired the Italian Chromium Products factory Cromital .
The Soda Plant and the Kromsan Chromium Compounds Plant produce chemicals, which are used in a variety of industrial and consumer goods  such as detergents, leather and pharmaceuticals.&lt;ref name="scc"/&gt;

==Production==
Soda Industry now is the leading producer of  chromium compounds  and the 4th greatest producer of sodium compounds (such as [[sodium dichromate]] ([[sodium|Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]][[chromium|Cr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]][[oxygen|O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;]]), [[chromium(III) sulfate|basic chromium sulfate]] (&lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[chromium|Cr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]([[hydrogen|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]][[oxygen|O]])&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;([[oxygen|O]][[hydrogen|H]])&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;][[sulfur|S]][[oxygen|O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]]) and [[chromic acid]] ([[hydrogen|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]][[chromium|Cr]][[oxygen|O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]] ) with an annual production of 2.2 million metric tons in Europe. [[Vitamin K3]] and [[sodium metabisulphite]] are among the other products.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sisecamkimyasallar.com/sites/catalogs/tr/Documents/surdurulebilirlik-raporlari/SodaSanayiiAS_Surdurulebilirlik_Raporu.pdf Soda Sanayii sustainability report {{tr icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="scc"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8126">The '''Synod of Bishops for the Pan-Amazon region''' is scheduled to meet in Rome in October 2019. [[Pope Francis]] announced on 15 October 2017 that it would work "to identify new paths for the evangelization of God's people in that region", specifically the [[indigenous peoples]] who are experiencing the destruction and exploitation of their natural environment and live "often forgotten and without the prospect of a serene future".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Galleazzi|first1=Giacomo|title=A Synod for the indigenous peoples of South America|url=http://www.lastampa.it/2017/10/15/vaticaninsider/eng/world-news/a-synod-for-the-indigenous-peoples-of-south-america-bu6BcrTX8a4HWl645ztM6O/pagina.html|accessdate=23 October 2017|work=La Stampa|date=15 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The obstacles to evangelization include the difficult terrain that makes native populations hard to reach,&lt;ref name=wantssynod /&gt; the great variety of languages spoken, and the resistance of landowners and business interests. The [[Amazon basin|Amazon]], according to one Vatican report, covers six million sq.km. with a population of 2.8 million organized into 400 tribes that "speak some 240 languages belonging to 49 linguistic families".&lt;ref name=repam /&gt; The Synod defines the region to include all or part of [[Religion in Bolivia|Bolivia]], [[Religion in Brazil|Brazil]], [[Religion in Colombia|Colombia]], [[Religion in Ecuador|Ecuador]], [[Religion in French Guiana|French Guiana]], [[Religion in Guyana|Guyana]], [[Religion in Peru|Peru]], [[Religion in Venezuela|Venezuela]], and [[Religion in Surinam|Surinam]], all countries where most of the population is Catholic.&lt;ref name=cruxannounce&gt;{{cite news|last1=San Martín|first1=Inés|title=Pope announces Synod of Bishops for Pan-Amazon region| url=https://cruxnow.com/vatican/2017/10/15/pope-announces-synod-bishops-pan-amazon-region/|accessdate=23 October 2017| work=Crux|date=15 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pope John Paul II]] called similar synods for the [[Catholicism in the Netherlands|Netherlands]] in 1980 and for [[Catholicism in Lebanon|Lebanon]] in 1995.&lt;ref name=cruxannounce /&gt;

== Background ==
As early as 1912, in the encyclical ''[[Lacrimabili statu]]'', [[Pope Pius X]] denounced the owners of the [[rubber plantation]]s in Peru for mistreating the native population&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Turvasi|first1=Francesco|title=Giovanni Genocchi and the Indians of South America, 1911–1913|date=1988|publisher=Editrice Pontifica Università Gregoriana|location=Rome|page=109|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EpY6KqzBXHQC&amp;pg=PA109&amp;|accessdate=23 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and condemned [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|Capuchin]] missionaries for failing to protect them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last1=McLeod| editor-first1=Hugh|title=The Cambridge History of Christianity|date=2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press| page=183|volume=9: World Christianities c.1914-c.2000 |first=Christopher |last=Abel| chapter=Latin America, c.1914-c.1950 | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Ms_SyCLNpuAC&amp;pg=PA183&amp;|accessdate=23 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Visiting Brazil in July 2013, Pope Francis said: "The Church's presence in the Amazon Basin is not that of someone with bags packed and ready to leave after having exploited everything possible. The Church has been present in the Amazon Basin from the beginning, in her [[missionaries]], [[Congregation (Catholic)|religious congregations]], [[priests]], [[laity]] and [[bishops]], and she is still present and critical to the area's future."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Pope Francis calls for 'respect and protection' of environment, end to exploitation of Amazon rainforest| url=http://nationalpost.com/holy-post/pope-francis-calls-for-respect-and-protection-of-environment-end-to-exploitation-of-amazon-rainforest |accessdate=23 October 2017|work=National Post|date=27 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pope Francis' encyclical, ''[[Laudato si'|Laudato si{{'}}]]'' (2015), focused on the need to defend of the poor and their natural environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Guardian view on Laudato Si': Pope Francis calls for a cultural revolution| url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jun/18/guardian-view-on-laudato-si-pope-francis-cultural-revolution|accessdate=23 October 2017| work=The Guardian|date=18 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since March 2015, the Pan-Amazon Ecclesial Network (REPAM) has coordinated the work of the Catholic Church in the Amazon region, marshaling the work of priests and missionaries, national representatives of [[Caritas Internationalis|Caritas]] and lay advocates to protect the both indigenous peoples of the Amazon and the [[natural resources]] of the region from exploitation.&lt;ref name=repam&gt;{{cite news | work= Zenit | accessdate = 23 October 2017 | date = 2 March 2015 | title= Vatican Presents Initiative to Protect Amazon | url = https://zenit.org/articles/vatican-presents-initiative-to-protect-amazon/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; Archbishop Salvador Pineiro García-Calderón of [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Ayacucho|Ayacucho]], President of the Peruvian Bishops' Conference, reported that Pope Francis proposed a synod devoted to the Amazon region in a meeting with the bishops of Peru in May 2017.&lt;ref name=wantssynod&gt;{{cite news|last1=Arocho Esteves|first1=Junno|title=Pope Francis wants synod dedicated to people in Amazon, archbishop says| url=https://www.americamagazine.org/faith/2017/05/16/pope-francis-wants-synod-dedicated-people-amazon-archbishop-says|accessdate=23 October 2017|work=America|agency=Catholic News Service |date=16 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He mentioned it to the bishops of Ecuador in September 2017.&lt;ref name=ecuador&gt;{{cite news | work = Zenit | accessdate = 23 October 2017 | date= 28 September 2017 | url = https://zenit.org/articles/ecuador-pope-encourages-organizing-synod-on-the-church-in-amazonia/ | title = Ecuador: Pope Encourages Organizing Synod on the Church in Amazon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Francis visited Peru in January 2018 and was met by 4,000 members of the indigenous communities from the [[Amazon rainforest]]. He said that the people of the Amazon were threatened now more than ever, and questioned the conservationist policies that affect the Peruvian rainforest. In [[Puerto Maldonado]], he asked for the indigenous communities to be recognized as partners instead of minorities. He said that "all the efforts we make in order to regain the life of the peoples of the Amazon will always be too few". He called on the Peruvian people to put an end to practices that degrade women and criticized the sterilization of indigenous women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://aa.com.tr/en/americas/pope-francis-visit-to-chile-and-peru-comes-to-an-end/1038139 |title=Pope Francis' visit to Chile and Peru comes to an end |access-date= 8 June 2018 |last= Serna Duque |first=Santiago |date=22 January 2018 |work= |publisher=Anadolu Agency }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.americamagazine.org/faith/2018/01/19/peru-pope-francis-says-church-stands-peoples-amazon-and-earth | first = Gerard | last= O'Connell | accessdate = 8 June 2018 | date= 19 January 2018 |title=In Peru, Pope Francis says the church stands with the peoples of the Amazon and the earth | work = [[America (magazine)|America]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2257">'''Tangible common equity''' ('''TCE''') is the subset of [[shareholders' equity]] that is not [[preferred equity]] and not [[intangible asset]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ftalphaville.ft.com/blog/2008/11/21/18538/tangled-tangibles/ "Tangled Tangibles", by Tracy Alloway] an [[FT Alphaville]] November 23, 2008 blog entry&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://baselinescenario.com/2009/02/24/tangible-common-equity-for-beginners/ "Tangible Common Equity for Beginners"] from [[James Kwak|baselinescenario.com]]&lt;/ref&gt;

TCE is an uncommonly used measure of a company's financial strength. It indicates how much [[ownership equity]] owners of [[common stock]] would receive in the event of a company's [[liquidation]]. During the financial and economic crisis of 2008–2009, it gained public popularity as a measure of the viability of large [[commercial banks]]. 

TCE, when used in a ratio with tangible common assets, is a measure of a bank's ability to absorb losses (e.g., [[Mortgage repossession|homeowners defaulting on mortgages]]) before becoming insolvent. It is one of the factors considered by the [[Office of the Comptroller of the Currency]] to determine if a bank has become insolvent.

==Formulae==
*'''''TCE = total equity – intangible assets – goodwill – preferred stock'''''{{cn|date=December 2017}}
*'''''TCE ratio = TCE / (total assets)'''''{{cn|date=December 2017}}
*'''''Leverage ratio = (total assets – intangible assets – goodwill) / TCE'''''{{cn|date=December 2017}}

==Example==
On February 27, 2009, the [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. Government]] converted [[preferred shares]] to [[common shares]] in order to increase [[Citigroup]]'s tangible common equity.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB123573983418294221?mod=googlenews_wsj "Citi to Exchange Preferred Securities for Common, Increasing Tangible Common Equity to as Much as $81 Billion", [[Wall Street Journal]], February 27, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; In this example, preferred stock equity is decreased, and total equity remains the same, increasing the TCE.

'''Telecommunication''' is the [[Transmission (telecommunications)|transmission]] of signs, signals, messages, words, writings, images and sounds or information of any nature by [[wire]], [[radio]], optical or  [[electromagnetic]] systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |publisher=[[International Telecommunication Union]] |title=[[ITU Radio Regulations]] |chapter=Article 1.3 |chapter-url=http://www.itu.int/dms_pub/itu-s/oth/02/02/S02020000244501PDFE.PDF |date=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Constitution and Convention of the International Telecommunication Union, Annex (Geneva, 1992)&lt;/ref&gt; Telecommunication occurs when the exchange of [[information]] between [[communication]] participants includes the use of [[technology]]. It is transmitted either electrically over physical media, such as [[electrical cable|cables]], or via [[electromagnetic radiation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://education.yahoo.com/reference/dictionary/entry/telecommunication |title=Definition of telecommunication |work=Yahoo |accessdate=28 February 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130501055117/http://education.yahoo.com/reference/dictionary/entry/telecommunication |archivedate=1 May 2013  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/telecommunication |title=Telecommunication  |work= Collins English Dictionary |accessdate=28 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/telecommunication |title=Telecommunication |work= Vocabulary.com |accessdate=28 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/telecommunication |title=Telecommunication  |work= Merriam-Webster Dictionary |accessdate=28 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="oxford"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/telecommunication?view=uk |title=Telecommunication  |work=Oxford Dictionaries |publisher=Oxford University Press  |accessdate=28 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/telecommunication?r=66 |title=Telecommunication  |work=Dictionary.com |accessdate=28 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such transmission paths are often divided into [[communication channel]]s which afford the advantages of [[multiplexing]]. Since the [[Latin]] term ''communicatio'' is considered the social process of information exchange, the term '''telecommunications''' is often used in its plural form because it involves many different technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SnjGRDVIUL4C&amp;pg=PA3&amp;lpg#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The Worldwide History of Telecommunications|last=Huurdeman|first=Anton A.|date=31 July 2003|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=9780471205050|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early means of communicating over a distance included visual signals, such as [[beacon]]s, [[smoke signal]]s, [[semaphore line|semaphore telegraphs]], [[signal flag]]s, and optical [[heliograph]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Websters definition: "2) technology that deals with telecommunication —usually used in plural"; Concise Encyclopedia definition: "Communication n parties at a distance from one another...."; and the Online Etymology Dictionary: "telecommunication (n.) 1932, from French télécommunication (see tele- + communication)."; and: " 1930s: from French télécommunication, from télé- 'at a distance' + communication 'communication{{'"}}, Oxford online.&lt;/ref&gt; Other examples of pre-modern long-distance communication included audio messages such as coded [[drum (communication)|drumbeats]], lung-blown [[Horn (instrument)|horns]], and loud whistles. 20th- and 21st-century technologies for long-distance communication usually involve electrical and electromagnetic technologies, such as [[electrical telegraph|telegraph]], [[telephone]], and [[teleprinter]], [[telecommunication network|networks]], [[radio]], [[microwave transmission]], [[Fiber-optic communication|fiber optics]], and [[communications satellite]]s.

A revolution in [[wireless communication]] began in the first decade of the 20th century with the pioneering developments in [[radio communications]] by [[Guglielmo Marconi]], who won the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] in 1909, and other notable pioneering inventors and developers in the field of electrical and electronic telecommunications. These included [[Charles Wheatstone]] and [[Samuel F.B. Morse|Samuel Morse]] (inventors of the [[telegraph]]), [[Alexander Graham Bell]] (inventor of the telephone), [[Edwin Armstrong]] and [[Lee de Forest]] (inventors of radio), as well as [[Vladimir K. Zworykin]], [[John Logie Baird]] and [[Philo Farnsworth]] (some of the inventors of [[television]]).

== Etymology ==
The word ''telecommunication'' is a compound of the Greek prefix ''tele'' (τηλε), meaning ''distant'', ''far off'', or ''afar'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=tele-&amp;allowed_in_frame=0|title=Online Etymology Dictionary|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Latin ''communicare'', meaning ''to share''. Its modern use is adapted from the French,&lt;ref name="oxford"/&gt; because its written use was recorded in 1904 by the French engineer and novelist [[Édouard Estaunié]].&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Marie Dilhac, [http://www.ieee.org/portal/cms_docs_iportals/iportals/aboutus/history_center/conferences/che2004/Dilhac.pdf From tele-communicare to Telecommunications], 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Telecommunication'', ''tele-'' and ''communication'', [[New Oxford American Dictionary]] (2nd edition), 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Communication'' was first used as an English word in the late 14th century. It comes from Old French comunicacion (14c., Modern French communication), from Latin communicationem (nominative communicatio), noun of action from past participle stem of communicare "to share, divide out; communicate, impart, inform; join, unite, participate in", literally "to make common", from communis".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=communication&amp;allowed_in_frame=0|title=Online Etymology Dictionary|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Beacons and pigeons ===
[[File:OptischerTelegraf.jpg|upright|thumb|A replica of one of [[Claude Chappe|Chappe's]] [[semaphore tower]]s]]

[[Homing pigeon]]s have occasionally been used throughout history by different cultures. [[Pigeon post]] had [[Persia]]n roots, and was later used by the Romans to aid their military. [[Frontinus]] said that [[Julius Caesar]] used pigeons as messengers in his conquest of [[Gaul]].&lt;ref name = "Levi"&gt;{{cite book |last=Levi |first=Wendell |title= The Pigeon|year= 1977|publisher= Levi Publishing Co, Inc|location= Sumter, S.C.|isbn=0853900132 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Greeks]] also conveyed the names of the victors at the Olympic Games to various cities using homing pigeons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Blechman | first =Andrew | title =Pigeons-The fascinating saga of the world's most revered and reviled bird. | publisher =University of Queensland Press | year =2007 | location =St Lucia, Queensland | url =http://www.uqp.uq.edu.au/book_details.php?id=9780702236419 | isbn =9780702236419 | deadurl =yes | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20080514003720/http://www.uqp.uq.edu.au/book_details.php?id=9780702236419 | archivedate =14 May 2008 | df =dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 19th century, the Dutch government used the system in [[Java (island)|Java]] and [[Sumatra]]. And in 1849, [[Paul Julius Reuter]] started a pigeon service to fly stock prices between [[Aachen]] and [[Brussels]], a service that operated for a year until the gap in the telegraph link was closed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Chronology: Reuters, from pigeons to multimedia merger | publisher =Reuters| url =https://www.reuters.com/article/rbssTechMediaTelecomNews/idUSL1849100620080219|format =Web article|accessdate =21 February 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Middle Ages, chains of [[beacon]]s were commonly used on hilltops as a means of relaying a signal. Beacon chains suffered the drawback that they could only pass a single bit of information, so the meaning of the message such as "the enemy has been sighted" had to be agreed upon in advance. One notable instance of their use was during the [[Spanish Armada]], when a beacon chain relayed a signal from [[Plymouth]] to London.&lt;ref&gt;David Ross, [http://www.britainexpress.com/History/tudor/armada.htm The Spanish Armada], Britain Express, accessed October 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1792, [[Claude Chappe]], a French engineer, built the first fixed visual telegraphy system (or [[semaphore line]]) between [[Lille]] and Paris.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chappe.ec-lyon.fr/ Les Télégraphes Chappe], Cédrick Chatenet, l'Ecole Centrale de Lyon, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; However semaphore suffered from the need for skilled operators and expensive towers at intervals of ten to thirty kilometres (six to nineteen miles). As a result of competition from the electrical telegraph, the last commercial line was abandoned in 1880.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itu.int/itudoc/gs/promo/tsb/88192.pdf CCIT/ITU-T 50 Years of Excellence], International Telecommunication Union, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Telegraph and telephone ===
On 25 July 1837 the first commercial [[electrical telegraph]] was demonstrated by English [[inventor]] [[Sir]] [[William Fothergill Cooke]], and English [[scientist]] [[Sir]] [[Charles Wheatstone]].&lt;ref&gt;William Brockedone. "Cooke and Wheatstone and the Invention of the Electric Telegraph". Republished by The Museum of Science and Technology (Ottawa).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/connecting-britain/first-electric-telegraph/|title=Who made the first electric telegraph communications?|work=The Telegraph|access-date=7 August 2017|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both inventors viewed their device as "an improvement to the [existing] electromagnetic telegraph" not as a new device.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.du.edu/~jcalvert/tel/morse/morse.htm The Electromagnetic Telegraph], J. B. Calvert, 19 May 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Samuel Morse]] independently developed a version of the electrical telegraph that he unsuccessfully demonstrated on 2 September 1837. [[Morse code|His code]] was an important advance over Wheatstone's signaling method. The first [[transatlantic telegraph cable]] was successfully completed on 27 July 1866, allowing transatlantic telecommunication for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sil.si.edu/digitalcollections/hst/atlantic-cable/ The Atlantic Cable], Bern Dibner, Burndy Library Inc., 1959&lt;/ref&gt;

The conventional telephone was invented independently by [[Alexander Graham Bell|Alexander Bell]] and [[Elisha Gray]] in 1876.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oberlin.edu/external/EOG/OYTT-images/ElishaGray.html Elisha Gray], Oberlin College Archives, Electronic Oberlin Group, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Antonio Meucci]] invented the first device that allowed the electrical transmission of voice over a line in 1849. However Meucci's device was of little practical value because it relied upon the [[electrophonic effect]] and thus required users to place the receiver in their mouth to "hear" what was being said.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060424055029/http://chem.ch.huji.ac.il/~eugeniik/history/meucci.html Antonio Santi Giuseppe Meucci], Eugenii Katz. (Retrieved May 2006 from [http://chem.ch.huji.ac.il/~eugeniik/history/meucci.html chem.ch.huji.ac.il])&lt;/ref&gt; The first commercial telephone services were set-up in 1878 and 1879 on both sides of the Atlantic in the cities of [[New Haven]] and London.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.connected-earth.com/Galleries/Telecommunicationsage/Thetelephone/index.htm Connected Earth: The telephone] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060822104544/http://www.connected-earth.com/Galleries/Telecommunicationsage/Thetelephone/index.htm |date=22 August 2006 }}, BT, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.att.com/history/milestones.html History of AT&amp;T], AT&amp;T, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Radio and television ===
Starting in 1894, Italian inventor [[Guglielmo Marconi]] began developing a wireless communication using the then newly discovered phenomenon of [[radio wave]]s, showing by 1901 that they could be transmitted across the Atlantic Ocean.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teslasociety.com/biography.htm Tesla Biography], Ljubo Vujovic, Tesla Memorial Society of New York, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; This was the start of [[wireless telegraphy]] by radio. Voice and music were demonstrated in 1900 and 1906, but had little early success.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} [[World War I]] accelerated the development of radio for [[military communications]]. After the war, commercial radio [[AM broadcasting]] began in the 1920s and became an important mass medium for entertainment and news. [[World War II]] again accelerated development of radio for the wartime purposes of aircraft and land communication, radio navigation and radar.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, Jr., R.J. (2011). Crystal Clear: The Struggle for Reliable Communications Technology in World War II, Hoboken, NJ: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt; Development of stereo [[FM broadcasting]] of radio took place from the 1930s on-wards in the United States and displaced AM as the dominant commercial standard by the 1960s, and by the 1970s in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;Théberge, P., Devine, K. &amp; Everrett, T. (2015). Living Stereo: Histories and Cultures of Multichannel Sound. New York: Bloomsbury Publishing USA.&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 25 March 1925, [[John Logie Baird]] was able to demonstrate the transmission of moving pictures at the London department store [[Selfridges]]. Baird's device relied upon the [[Nipkow disk]] and thus became known as the [[mechanical television]]. It formed the basis of experimental broadcasts done by the [[British Broadcasting Corporation]] beginning 30 September 1929.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mztv.com/newframe.asp?content=http://www.mztv.com/pioneers.html The Pioneers] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130514070220/http://www.mztv.com/newframe.asp?content=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mztv.com%2Fpioneers.html |date=14 May 2013 }}, MZTV Museum of Television, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; However, for most of the twentieth century televisions depended upon the [[cathode ray tube]] invented by [[Karl Ferdinand Braun|Karl Braun]]. The first version of such a television to show promise was produced by [[Philo Farnsworth]] and demonstrated to his family on 7 September 1927.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/time100/scientist/profile/farnsworth.html Philo Farnsworth], Neil Postman, [[TIME Magazine]], 29 March 1999&lt;/ref&gt; After [[World War II]], the experiments in television that had been interrupted were resumed, and it also became an important home entertainment broadcast medium.

=== Computers and the Internet ===
On 11 September 1940, [[George Stibitz]] transmitted problems for his Complex Number Calculator in New York using a [[teletype]], and received the computed results back at [[Dartmouth College]] in [[New Hampshire]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kerryr.net/pioneers/stibitz.htm George Stibitz], Kerry Redshaw, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; This configuration of a centralized computer ([[Mainframe computer|mainframe]]) with remote [[dumb terminals]] remained popular well into the 1970s. However, already in the 1960s, researchers started to investigate [[packet switching]], a technology that sends a message in portions to its destination [[Asynchronous Transfer Mode|asynchronously]] without passing it through a centralized [[mainframe]]. A four-[[node (networking)|node]] [[computer network|network]] emerged on 5 December 1969, constituting the beginnings of the [[ARPANET]], which by 1981 had grown to 213 nodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Hafner | first = Katie | title = Where Wizards Stay Up Late: The Origins Of The Internet | publisher = Simon &amp; Schuster | year = 1998 | isbn = 0-684-83267-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ARPANET eventually merged with other networks to form the [[Internet]]. While Internet development was a focus of the [[Internet Engineering Task Force]] (IETF) who published a series of [[Request for Comment]] documents, other networking advancement occurred in [[industrial laboratory|industrial laboratories]], such as the [[local area network]] (LAN) developments of [[Ethernet]] (1983) and the [[token ring]] protocol (1984){{citation needed|date=April 2018}}.

== Key concepts ==
Modern telecommunication is founded on a series of key concepts that experienced progressive development and refinement in a period of well over a century.

=== Basic elements ===
Telecommunication technologies may primarily be divided into wired and wireless methods. Overall though, a basic [[communication system|telecommunication system]] consists of three main parts that are always present in some form or another:
* A [[transmitter]] that takes information and converts it to a [[signal (electrical engineering)|signal]].
* A [[transmission medium]], also called the ''physical channel'' that carries the signal. An example of this is the [[Free-space optical communication|"free space channel"]].
* A [[receiver (radio)|receiver]] that takes the signal from the channel and converts it back into usable information for the recipient.

For example, in a [[radio station|radio broadcasting station]] the station's large [[power amplifier]] is the transmitter; and the broadcasting [[antenna (radio)|antenna]] is the interface between the power amplifier and the "free space channel". The free space channel is the transmission medium; and the receiver's antenna is the interface between the free space channel and the receiver. Next, the [[radio receiver]] is the destination of the radio signal, and this is where it is converted from electricity to sound for people to listen to.

Sometimes, telecommunication systems are [[duplex (telecommunications)|"duplex"]] (two-way systems) with a single box of [[electronics]] working as both the transmitter and a receiver, or a ''transceiver''. For example, a [[cellular telephone]] is a transceiver.&lt;ref name="stallings-intro"&gt;{{cite book | last = Haykin | first = Simon | edition= 4th | title = Communication Systems | publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons | year = 2001 | pages = 1–3 | isbn = 0-471-17869-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The transmission electronics and the receiver electronics within a transceiver are actually quite independent of each other. This can be readily explained by the fact that radio transmitters contain power amplifiers that operate with electrical powers measured in [[watt]]s or [[kilowatt]]s, but radio receivers deal with radio powers that are measured in the [[microwatt]]s or [[nanowatt]]s. Hence, transceivers have to be carefully designed and built to isolate their high-power circuitry and their low-power circuitry from each other, as to not cause interference.

Telecommunication over fixed lines is called [[point-to-point communication (telecommunications)|point-to-point communication]] because it is between one transmitter and one receiver. Telecommunication through radio broadcasts is called [[broadcasting|broadcast communication]] because it is between one powerful transmitter and numerous low-power but sensitive radio receivers.&lt;ref name="stallings-intro" /&gt;

Telecommunications in which multiple transmitters and multiple receivers have been designed to cooperate and to share the same physical channel are called [[multiplexing|multiplex systems]]. The sharing of physical channels using multiplexing often gives very large reductions in costs. Multiplexed systems are laid out in telecommunication networks, and the multiplexed signals are switched at nodes through to the correct destination terminal receiver.

=== Analog versus digital communications ===
Communications signals can be sent either by [[analog signal]]s or [[Digital signal (electronics)|digital signals]]. There are [[analog communication]] systems and [[digital communication]] systems. For an analog signal, the signal is varied continuously with respect to the information. In a digital signal, the information is encoded as a set of discrete values (for example, a set of ones and zeros). During the propagation and reception, the information contained in analog signals will inevitably be degraded by [[noise (signal processing)|undesirable physical noise]]. (The output of a transmitter is noise-free for all practical purposes.) Commonly, the noise in a communication system can be expressed as adding or subtracting from the desirable signal in a completely [[random process|random way]]. This form of noise is called [[additive noise]], with the understanding that the noise can be negative or positive at different instants of time. Noise that is not additive noise is a much more difficult situation to describe or analyze, and these other kinds of noise will be omitted here.

On the other hand, unless the additive noise disturbance exceeds a certain threshold, the information contained in digital signals will remain intact. Their resistance to noise represents a key advantage of digital signals over analog signals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Ambardar | first = Ashok | edition= 2nd | title = Analog and Digital Signal Processing | publisher = Brooks/Cole Publishing Company | year = 1999 | pages = 1–2 | isbn = 0-534-95409-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Telecommunication networks ===
A [[telecommunications network]] is a collection of transmitters, receivers, and [[communications channel]]s that send messages to one another. Some digital communications networks contain one or more [[Router (computing)|routers]] that work together to transmit information to the correct user. An analog communications network consists of one or more [[telephone switch|switches]] that establish a connection between two or more users. For both types of network, [[repeater]]s may be necessary to amplify or recreate the signal when it is being transmitted over long distances. This is to combat [[attenuation]] that can render the signal indistinguishable from the noise.&lt;ref name="glossary"&gt;[http://www.atis.org/tg2k/ ATIS Telecom Glossary 2000] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080302071329/http://www.atis.org/tg2k/ |date=2 March 2008 }}, ATIS Committee T1A1 Performance and Signal Processing (approved by the American National Standards Institute), 28 February 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;
Another advantage of digital systems over analog is that their output is easier to store in memory, i.e. two voltage states (high and low) are easier to store than a continuous range of states.

=== Communication channels ===
The term "channel" has two different meanings. In one meaning, a channel is the physical medium that carries a signal between the transmitter and the receiver. Examples of this include the [[atmosphere]] for sound communications, glass [[optical fiber]]s for some kinds of [[optical communications]], [[coaxial cable]]s for communications by way of the voltages and electric currents in them, and [[Free-space optical communication|free space]] for communications using [[visible light]], [[infrared|infrared waves]], [[ultraviolet light]], and [[radio wave]]s. Coaxial cable types are classified by RG type or "radio guide", terminology derived from World War II. The various RG designations are used to classify the specific signal transmission applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.conwire.com/coax-cable-rg-cable-blog|title=Coax Cable FAQ Series: What is RG Cable? – Conwire|date=12 January 2016|work=Conwire|access-date=7 August 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; This last channel is called the "free space channel". The sending of radio waves from one place to another has nothing to do with the presence or absence of an atmosphere between the two. Radio waves travel through a perfect [[vacuum]] just as easily as they travel through air, fog, clouds, or any other kind of gas.

The other meaning of the term "channel" in telecommunications is seen in the phrase [[channel (communications)|communications channel]], which is a subdivision of a transmission medium so that it can be used to send multiple streams of information simultaneously. For example, one radio station can broadcast radio waves into free space at frequencies in the neighborhood of 94.5&amp;nbsp;[[MHz]] (megahertz) while another radio station can simultaneously broadcast radio waves at frequencies in the neighborhood of 96.1&amp;nbsp;MHz. Each radio station would transmit radio waves over a frequency [[bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] of about 180&amp;nbsp;[[kHz]] (kilohertz), centered at frequencies such as the above, which are called the [[Carrier wave|"carrier frequencies"]]. Each station in this example is separated from its adjacent stations by 200&amp;nbsp;kHz, and the difference between 200&amp;nbsp;kHz and 180&amp;nbsp;kHz (20&amp;nbsp;kHz) is an engineering allowance for the imperfections in the communication system.

In the example above, the "free space channel" has been divided into communications channels according to [[frequency|frequencies]], and each channel is assigned a separate frequency bandwidth in which to broadcast radio waves. This system of dividing the medium into channels according to frequency is called "[[frequency-division multiplexing]]".  Another term for the same concept is "[[wavelength-division multiplexing]]", which is more commonly used in optical communications when multiple transmitters share the same physical medium.

Another way of dividing a communications medium into channels is to allocate each sender a recurring segment of time (a "time slot", for example, 20 [[milliseconds]] out of each second), and to allow each sender to send messages only within its own time slot. This method of dividing the medium into communication channels is called "[[time-division multiplexing]]" ('''TDM'''), and is used in optical fiber communication. Some radio communication systems use TDM within an allocated FDM channel. Hence, these systems use a hybrid of TDM and FDM.

=== Modulation ===
The shaping of a signal to convey information is known as [[modulation]]. Modulation can be used to represent a digital message as an analog waveform. This is commonly called [[keying (telecommunications)|"keying"]] – a term derived from the older use of Morse Code in telecommunications – and several keying techniques exist (these include [[phase-shift keying]], [[frequency-shift keying]], and [[amplitude-shift keying]]). The "[[Bluetooth]]" system, for example, uses phase-shift keying to exchange information between various devices.&lt;ref&gt;Haykin, pp 344–403.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bluetooth.org/foundry/adopters/document/Core_v2.0_EDR/en/1/Core_v2.0_EDR.zip Bluetooth Specification Version 2.0 + EDR] (p 27), Bluetooth, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, there are combinations of phase-shift keying and amplitude-shift keying which is called (in the jargon of the field) "[[quadrature amplitude modulation]]" (QAM) that are used in high-capacity digital radio communication systems.

Modulation can also be used to transmit the information of low-frequency analog signals at higher frequencies. This is helpful because low-frequency analog signals cannot be effectively transmitted over free space. Hence the information from a low-frequency analog signal must be impressed into a higher-frequency signal (known as the "[[carrier wave]]") before transmission. There are several different modulation schemes available to achieve this [two of the most basic being [[amplitude modulation]] (AM) and [[frequency modulation]] (FM)]. An example of this process is a disc jockey's voice being impressed into a 96&amp;nbsp;MHz carrier wave using frequency modulation (the voice would then be received on a radio as the channel "96&amp;nbsp;FM").&lt;ref&gt;Haykin, pp 88–126.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, modulation has the advantage that it may use frequency division multiplexing (FDM).

== Society ==
Telecommunication has a significant social, cultural and economic impact on modern society. In 2008, estimates placed the [[telecommunication industry]]'s revenue at $4.7&amp;nbsp;trillion or just under 3 percent of the [[gross world product]] (official exchange rate).&lt;ref name="plunkettresearch01" /&gt; Several following sections discuss the impact of telecommunication on society.

=== Economic impact ===

==== Microeconomics ====
On the microeconomic scale, companies have used telecommunications to help build global business empires. This is self-evident in the case of online retailer [[Amazon.com]] but, according to academic Edward Lenert, even the conventional retailer [[Walmart]] has benefited from better telecommunication infrastructure compared to its competitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Lenert | first = Edward |date=December 1998 | title = A Communication Theory Perspective on Telecommunications Policy | journal = Journal of Communication| volume = 48 | issue = 4 | pages = 3–23 |doi=10.1111/j.1460-2466.1998.tb02767.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; In cities throughout the world, home owners use their telephones to order and arrange a variety of home services ranging from pizza deliveries to electricians. Even relatively poor communities have been noted to use telecommunication to their advantage. In [[Bangladesh]]'s Narshingdi district, isolated villagers use cellular phones to speak directly to wholesalers and arrange a better price for their goods. In [[Ivory Coast|Côte d'Ivoire]], coffee growers share mobile phones to follow hourly variations in coffee prices and sell at the best price.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Mireille Samaan | title = The Effect of Income Inequality on Mobile Phone Penetration | version = Boston University Honors thesis | date = April 2003 | url = http://dissertations.bc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1016&amp;context=ashonors | format = PDF | accessdate =8 June 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070214102055/http://dissertations.bc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1016&amp;context=ashonors |archivedate = 14 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Macroeconomics ====
On the macroeconomic scale, Lars-Hendrik Röller and [[Leonard Waverman]] suggested a causal link between good telecommunication infrastructure and economic growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1257/aer.91.4.909 | last = Röller | first = Lars-Hendrik |author2=Leonard Waverman  | title = Telecommunications Infrastructure and Economic Development: A Simultaneous Approach | journal = American Economic Review | issn = 0002-8282 | year = 2001 | volume = 91 | issue = 4 | pages = 909–923}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Christine Zhen-Wei Qiang and Carlo M.

Because of the economic benefits of good telecommunication infrastructure, there is increasing worry about the inequitable access to telecommunication services amongst various countries of the world—this is known as the [[digital divide]]. A 2003 survey by the [[International Telecommunication Union]] (ITU) revealed that roughly a third of countries have fewer than one mobile subscription for every 20 people and one-third of countries have fewer than one land-line telephone subscription for every 20 people. In terms of Internet access, roughly half of all countries have fewer than one out of 20 people with Internet access. From this information, as well as educational data, the ITU was able to compile an index that measures the overall ability of citizens to access and use information and communication technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Digital Access Index (DAI)|url=http://www.itu.int/ITU-D/ict/dai/|publisher=itu.int|accessdate=6 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using this measure, Sweden, Denmark and [[Iceland]] received the highest ranking while the African countries Nigeria, Burkina Faso and Mali received the lowest.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itu.int/ITU-D/ict/publications/wtdr_03/index.html World Telecommunication Development Report 2003], International Telecommunication Union, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Social impact ===
Telecommunication has played a significant role in social relationships. Nevertheless, devices like the telephone system were originally advertised with an emphasis on the practical dimensions of the device (such as the ability to conduct business or order home services) as opposed to the social dimensions. It was not until the late 1920s and 1930s that the social dimensions of the device became a prominent theme in telephone advertisements. New promotions started appealing to consumers' emotions, stressing the importance of social conversations and staying connected to family and friends.&lt;ref name="fischer"&gt;Fischer, Claude S. {{"'}}Touch Someone': The Telephone Industry Discovers Sociability." Technology and Culture 29.1 (January 1988): 32–61. {{doi|10.2307/3105226}}. {{JSTOR|3105226}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then the role that telecommunications has played in social relations has become increasingly important. In recent years, the popularity of [[social networking site]]s has increased dramatically. These sites allow users to communicate with each other as well as post photographs, events and profiles for others to see. The profiles can list a person's age, interests, sexual preference and relationship status. In this way, these sites can play important role in everything from organising social engagements to [[courtship]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=How do you know your love is real? Check Facebook|publisher=CNN|url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/LIVING/personal/04/04/facebook.love/index.html|date=4 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- [[As of 2009]], [Facebook]] – the leading social networking site according to Internet analysis and marketing company [[comScore]] – has a self-reported 150 million active users.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Facebook Statistics|url=https://www.facebook.com/press/info.php?statistics|publisher=Facebook|accessdate=8 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Social Networking Explodes Worldwide as Sites Increase their Focus on Cultural Relevance|url=http://www.comscore.com/press/release.asp?press=2396|publisher=comScore|date=12 August 2008|accessdate=8 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;

Prior to social networking sites, technologies like [[short message service]] (SMS) and the telephone also had a significant impact on social interactions. In 2000, market research group [[Ipsos MORI]] reported that 81% of 15- to 24-year-old SMS users in the United Kingdom had used the service to coordinate social arrangements and 42% to flirt.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipsos-mori.com/researchpublications/researcharchive/1575/I-Just-Text-To-Say-I-Love-You.aspx I Just Text To Say I Love You], Ipsos MORI, September 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

In cultural terms, telecommunication has increased the public's ability to access music and film. With television, people can watch films they have not seen before in their own home without having to travel to the video store or cinema. With radio and the Internet, people can listen to music they have not heard before without having to travel to the music store.

Telecommunication has also transformed the way people receive their news. A 2006 survey (right table) of slightly more than 3,000 Americans by the non-profit Pew Internet and American Life Project in the United States the majority specified television or radio over newspapers. 

Telecommunication has had an equally significant impact on advertising. [[TNS Media Intelligence]] reported that in 2007, 58% of advertising expenditure in the United States was spent on media that depend upon telecommunication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=100 Leading National Advertisers|publisher=Advertising Age|format=PDF|url=http://adage.com/images/random/datacenter/2008/spendtrends08.pdf|date=23 June 2008|accessdate=21 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many countries have enacted legislation which conforms to the ''International Telecommunication Regulations'' established by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), which is the "leading UN agency for information and communication technology issues."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itu.int/net/about/index.aspx International Telecommunication Union : About ITU].

([https://www.itu.int/osg/csd/wtpf/wtpf2009/documents/ITU_ITRs_88.pdf PDF] of regulation)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1947, at the Atlantic City Conference, the ITU decided to "afford international protection to all frequencies registered in a new international frequency list and used in conformity with the Radio Regulation." According to the ITU's ''Radio Regulations'' adopted in Atlantic City, all frequencies referenced in the ''International Frequency Registration Board'', examined by the board and registered on the ''International Frequency List'' "shall have the right to international protection from harmful interference."&lt;ref&gt;Codding, George A.

From a global perspective, there have been political debates and legislation regarding the management of telecommunication and broadcasting. The [[history of broadcasting]] discusses some debates in relation to balancing conventional communication such as printing and telecommunication such as radio broadcasting.&lt;ref name="Wood" /&gt; The onset of [[World War II]] brought on the first explosion of international broadcasting propaganda.&lt;ref name="Wood"&gt;Wood, James &amp; Science Museum (Great Britain) "''[https://books.google.com/books?id=WUO4U8L5N_cC&amp;pg=PA3&amp;lpg=PA3&amp;dq=%22countries+use+telecommunications+for+propaganda&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=xZ23AbxMud&amp;sig=elOIe1XUeivJ4fvrB5DPXDA6H54&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=CglmSpWjMIraNu3r9ZsB&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2 History of international broadcasting]''".

Modern insurgents, such as those in the latest [[Iraq War]], often use intimidating telephone calls, SMSs and the distribution of sophisticated videos of an attack on coalition troops within hours of the operation. "The Sunni insurgents even have their own television station, [[Al-Zawraa TV|Al-Zawraa]], which while banned by the Iraqi government, still broadcasts from [[Erbil]], Iraqi Kurdistan, even as coalition pressure has forced it to switch satellite hosts several times."&lt;ref name="Garfield"&gt;Garfield, Andrew.

=== Telephone ===
[[File:Fibreoptic.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Optical fiber]] provides cheaper bandwidth for long distance communication.]]

In a [[telephone]] network, the caller is connected to the person they want to talk to by switches at various [[telephone exchanges]]. The switches form an electrical connection between the two users and the setting of these switches is determined electronically when the caller [[pulse dialing|dials]] the number. Once the connection is made, the caller's voice is transformed to an electrical signal using a small [[microphone]] in the caller's [[handset]]. This electrical signal is then sent through the network to the user at the other end where it is transformed back into sound by a small [[loudspeaker|speaker]] in that person's handset.

The landline telephones in most residential homes are analog—that is, the speaker's voice directly determines the signal's voltage.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} Although short-distance calls may be handled from end-to-end as analog signals, increasingly telephone service providers are transparently converting the signals to digital signals for transmission. The advantage of this is that digitized voice data can travel side-by-side with data from the Internet and can be perfectly reproduced in long distance communication (as opposed to analog signals that are inevitably impacted by noise).

Mobile phones have had a significant impact on telephone networks. Mobile phone subscriptions now outnumber fixed-line subscriptions in many markets. Sales of mobile phones in 2005 totalled 816.6&amp;nbsp;million with that figure being almost equally shared amongst the markets of Asia/Pacific (204 m), Western Europe (164 m), CEMEA (Central Europe, the Middle East and Africa) (153.5 m), North America (148 m) and Latin America (102 m).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gartner.com/press_releases/asset_145891_11.html Gartner Says Top Six Vendors Drive Worldwide Mobile Phone Sales to 21% Growth in 2005], Gartner Group, 28 February 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of new subscriptions over the five years from 1999, Africa has outpaced other markets with 58.2% growth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spectrum.ieee.org/may06/3426 Africa Calling] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060624100209/http://www.spectrum.ieee.org/may06/3426 |date=24 June 2006 }}, Victor and Irene Mbarika, [[IEEE Spectrum]], May 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Increasingly these phones are being serviced by systems where the voice content is transmitted digitally such as [[GSM]] or [[W-CDMA]] with many markets choosing to deprecate analog systems such as [[Advanced Mobile Phone System|AMPS]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amta.org.au/default.asp?Page=142 Ten Years of GSM in Australia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080720110058/http://www.amta.org.au/default.asp?Page=142 |date=20 July 2008 }}, Australia Telecommunications Association, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

There have also been dramatic changes in telephone communication behind the scenes. Starting with the operation of [[TAT-8]] in 1988, the 1990s saw the widespread adoption of systems based on optical fibers. The benefit of communicating with optic fibers is that they offer a drastic increase in data capacity. TAT-8 itself was able to carry 10 times as many telephone calls as the last copper cable laid at that time and today's optic fibre cables are able to carry 25 times as many telephone calls as TAT-8.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.att.com/history/milestones.html Milestones in AT&amp;T History], AT&amp;T Knowledge Ventures, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; This increase in data capacity is due to several factors: First, optic fibres are physically much smaller than competing technologies. Second, they do not suffer from [[crosstalk (electronics)|crosstalk]] which means several hundred of them can be easily bundled together in a single cable.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/S.Bhatti/D51-notes/node21.html Optical fibre waveguide] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060524033058/http://www.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/S.Bhatti/D51-notes/node21.html |date=24 May 2006 }}, Saleem Bhatti, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; Lastly, improvements in multiplexing have led to an exponential growth in the data capacity of a single fibre.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cisco.com/univercd/cc/td/doc/product/mels/cm1500/dwdm/dwdm_ovr.pdf Fundamentals of DWDM Technology], CISCO Systems, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lightreading.com/document.asp?doc_id=31358 Report: DWDM No Match for Sonet], Mary Jander, Light Reading, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Assisting communication across many modern optic fibre networks is a protocol known as [[Asynchronous Transfer Mode]] (ATM). The ATM protocol allows for the side-by-side data transmission mentioned in the second paragraph. It is suitable for public telephone networks because it establishes a pathway for data through the network and associates a [[traffic contract]] with that pathway. The traffic contract is essentially an agreement between the client and the network about how the network is to handle the data; if the network cannot meet the conditions of the traffic contract it does not accept the connection. This is important because telephone calls can negotiate a contract so as to guarantee themselves a constant bit rate, something that will ensure a caller's voice is not delayed in parts or cut off completely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Stallings | first = William | edition= 7th edition (intl) | title = Data and Computer Communications | publisher = Pearson Prentice Hall | year = 2004 | pages = 337–366 | isbn = 0-13-183311-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are competitors to ATM, such as [[Multiprotocol Label Switching]] (MPLS), that perform a similar task and are expected to supplant ATM in the future.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.networkworld.com/columnists/2002/0812edit.html MPLS is the future, but ATM hangs on] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070706034545/http://www.networkworld.com/columnists/2002/0812edit.html |date=6 July 2007 }}, John Dix, Network World, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lazar|first=Irwin|title=The WAN Road Ahead: Ethernet or Bust?|url=http://www.telarus.com/industry/the-wan-road-ahead:-ethernet-or-bust.html|accessdate=22 February 2011|newspaper=Telecom Industry Updates|date=22 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Radio and television ===
{{Main article|Radio|Television|Broadcasting}}
[[File:Digital broadcast standards.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|[[Digital television]] standards and their adoption worldwide]]

In a broadcast system, the central high-powered [[radio masts and towers|broadcast tower]] transmits a high-frequency [[electromagnetic wave]] to numerous low-powered receivers. The high-frequency wave sent by the tower is modulated with a signal containing visual or audio information. The receiver is then [[antenna tuner|tuned]] so as to pick up the high-frequency wave and a [[demodulator]] is used to retrieve the signal containing the visual or audio information. The broadcast signal can be either analog (signal is varied continuously with respect to the information) or digital (information is encoded as a set of discrete values).&lt;ref name="stallings-intro" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.howstuffworks.com/radio.htm How Radio Works], HowStuffWorks.com, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[broadcast media industry]] is at a critical turning point in its development, with many countries moving from analog to digital broadcasts. This move is made possible by the production of cheaper, faster and more capable [[integrated circuit]]s. The chief advantage of digital broadcasts is that they prevent a number of complaints common to traditional analog broadcasts. For television, this includes the elimination of problems such as [[noise (video)|snowy pictures]], [[television interference (ghosting)|ghosting]] and other distortion. These occur because of the nature of analog transmission, which means that perturbations due to noise will be evident in the final output. Digital transmission overcomes this problem because digital signals are reduced to discrete values upon reception and hence small perturbations do not affect the final output. In a simplified example, if a binary message 1011 was transmitted with signal amplitudes [1.0 0.0 1.0 1.0] and received with signal amplitudes [0.9 0.2 1.1 0.9] it would still decode to the binary message 1011 – a perfect reproduction of what was sent. From this example, a problem with digital transmissions can also be seen in that if the noise is great enough it can significantly alter the decoded message. Using [[forward error correction]] a receiver can correct a handful of bit errors in the resulting message but too much noise will lead to incomprehensible output and hence a breakdown of the transmission.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digitaltv.com.au/ Digital Television in Australia], Digital Television News Australia, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Stallings | first = William | edition= 7th edition (intl) | title = Data and Computer Communications | publisher = Pearson Prentice Hall | year = 2004 | isbn = 0-13-183311-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In digital television broadcasting, there are three competing standards that are likely to be adopted worldwide. These are the [[ATSC Standards|ATSC]], [[Digital Video Broadcasting|DVB]] and [[ISDB]] standards; the adoption of these standards thus far is presented in the captioned map. All three standards use [[MPEG-2]] for video compression. ATSC uses [[Dolby Digital|Dolby Digital AC-3]] for audio compression, ISDB uses [[Advanced Audio Coding]] (MPEG-2 Part 7) and DVB has no standard for audio compression but typically uses [[MPEG-1|MPEG-1 Part 3 Layer 2]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dynamix.ca/doc/HDVhandbook1.pdf HDV Technology Handbook] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060623142640/http://www.dynamix.ca/doc/HDVhandbook1.pdf |date=23 June 2006 }}, [[Sony]], 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dvb.org/technology/standards_specifications/audio/ Audio], Digital Video Broadcasting Project, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; The choice of modulation also varies between the schemes.&lt;!--Both DVB and ISDB use [[orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing]] (OFDM) for terrestrial broadcasts (as opposed to satellite or cable broadcasts) whereas ATSC uses [[8VSB|vestigial sideband modulation]] (VSB). OFDM should offer better resistance to multipath interference and the [[Doppler effect]] (which would impact reception using moving receivers).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mrcbroadcast.com/tech_services/COFDM%20vs%20VSB.html COFDM versus VSB in ENG/HD-ENG], Microwave Radio Communications, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; However controversial tests conducted by the United States' [[National Association of Broadcasters]] have shown that there is little difference between the two for stationary receivers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hdtvmagazine.com/archives/mstvtestsum.html 8VSB/COFDM Comparison Report], VSB/COFDM Project, December 2000 (preface by Dale Cripps of HDTV Magazine).&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt; In digital audio broadcasting, standards are much more unified with practically all countries choosing to adopt the [[Digital Audio Broadcasting]] standard (also known as the [[Eureka 147]] standard). The exception is the United States which has chosen to adopt [[HD Radio]]. HD Radio, unlike Eureka 147, is based upon a transmission method known as [[in-band on-channel]] transmission that allows digital information to "piggyback" on normal AM or FM analog transmissions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worlddab.org/cstatus.aspx Status of DAB (USA)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060721060832/http://www.worlddab.org/cstatus.aspx |date=21 July 2006 }}, World DAB Forum, March 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- This avoids the bandwidth allocation issues of Eureka 147 and therefore being strongly advocated National Association of Broadcasters who felt there was a lack of new spectrum to allocate for the Eureka 147 standard. --&gt;&lt;!-- In the United States the [[Federal Communications Commission]] has chosen to leave licensing of the standard in the hands of a commercial corporation called [[iBiquity]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibiquity.com/licensing/index.htm Licensing], iBiquity Digital, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; An open in-band on-channel standard exists in the form of [[Digital Radio Mondiale]] (DRM) however adoption of this standard is mostly limited to a handful of [[shortwave|shortwave broadcasts]]. Despite the different names all standards rely upon OFDM for modulation.--&gt; &lt;!--In terms of audio compression, DRM typically uses Advanced Audio Coding (MPEG-4 Part 3), DAB like DVB can use a variety of codecs but typically uses MPEG-1 Part 3 Layer 2. HD Radio uses a codec called [[High-Definition Coding]].--&gt;

However, despite the pending switch to digital, analog television remains being transmitted in most countries. An exception is the United States that ended analog television transmission (by all but the very low-power TV stations) on 12 June 2009&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Brian Stelter | title=Changeover to Digital TV Off to a Smooth Start | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/14/business/media/14digital.html?_r=2&amp;hp |work=New York Times | date=13 June 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; after twice delaying the switchover deadline. Kenya also ended analog television transmission in December 2014 after multiple delays. For analog television, there were three standards in use for broadcasting color TV (see a map on adoption [[:File:NTSC-PAL-SECAM.png|here]]). These are known as [[PAL]] (German designed), [[NTSC]] (American designed), and [[SECAM]] (French designed). For analog radio, the switch to digital radio is made more difficult by the higher cost of digital receivers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worlddab.org/dabprod.aspx DAB Products] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060621082027/http://www.worlddab.org/dabprod.aspx |date=21 June 2006 }}, World DAB Forum, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The choice of modulation for analog radio is typically between amplitude ('''AM''') or frequency modulation ('''FM'''). To achieve [[stereophonic sound|stereo playback]], an amplitude modulated subcarrier is used for [[stereo FM]], and quadrature amplitude modulation is used for stereo AM or [[C-QUAM]].

=== Internet ===
[[File:OSI Model v1.svg|upright=1.2|thumb|The [[OSI reference model]]]]

The [[Internet]] is a worldwide network of computers and computer networks that communicate with each other using the [[Internet Protocol]] (IP).&lt;ref&gt;Robert E. Kahn and Vinton G. Cerf, [http://www.cnri.reston.va.us/what_is_internet.html What Is The Internet (And What Makes It Work)], December 1999. (specifically see footnote xv)&lt;/ref&gt; Any computer on the Internet has a unique [[IP address]] that can be used by other computers to route information to it. Hence, any computer on the Internet can send a message to any other computer using its IP address. These messages carry with them the originating computer's IP address allowing for two-way communication. The Internet is thus an exchange of messages between computers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://computer.howstuffworks.com/internet-infrastructure.htm |title=How Internet Infrastructure Works |website=Computer.HowStuffWorks.com |year=2007 |author=Jeff Tyson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is estimated that 51% of the information flowing through two-way telecommunications networks in the year 2000 were flowing through the Internet (most of the rest (42%) through the [[landline telephone]]). By the year 2007 the Internet clearly dominated and captured 97% of all the information in telecommunication networks (most of the rest (2%) through [[mobile phones]]).&lt;ref name="HilbertLopez2011"/&gt; {{As of|2008}}, an estimated 21.9% of the world population has access to the Internet with the highest access rates (measured as a percentage of the population) in North America (73.6%), Oceania/Australia (59.5%) and Europe (48.1%).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.internetworldstats.com/stats.htm World Internet Users and Population Stats], internetworldstats.com, 19 March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of [[Broadband Internet access|broadband access]], Iceland (26.7%), South Korea (25.4%) and the Netherlands (25.3%) led the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oecd.org/document/39/0,2340,en_2649_34225_36459431_1_1_1_1,00.html OECD Broadband Statistics], [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]], December 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Internet works in part because of [[communications protocol|protocols]] that govern how the computers and routers communicate with each other. The nature of computer network communication lends itself to a layered approach where individual protocols in the protocol stack run more-or-less independently of other protocols. This allows lower-level protocols to be customized for the network situation while not changing the way higher-level protocols operate. A practical example of why this is important is because it allows an [[Internet browser]] to run the same code regardless of whether the computer it is running on is connected to the Internet through an Ethernet or [[Wi-Fi]] connection. Protocols are often talked about in terms of their place in the OSI reference model (pictured on the right), which emerged in 1983 as the first step in an unsuccessful attempt to build a universally adopted networking protocol suite.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tcpipguide.com/free/t_HistoryoftheOSIReferenceModel.htm History of the OSI Reference Model], The TCP/IP Guide v3.0, Charles M. Kozierok, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

For the Internet, the physical medium and data link protocol can vary several times as packets traverse the globe. This is because the Internet places no constraints on what physical medium or data link protocol is used. This leads to the adoption of media and protocols that best suit the local network situation. In practice, most intercontinental communication will use the Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) protocol (or a modern equivalent) on top of optic fiber. This is because for most intercontinental communication the Internet shares the same infrastructure as the public switched telephone network.

At the network layer, things become standardized with the Internet Protocol (IP) being adopted for [[logical address]]ing. For the World Wide Web, these "IP addresses" are derived from the human readable form using the [[Domain Name System]] (e.g. 72.14.207.99 is derived from www.google.com). At the moment, the most widely used version of the Internet Protocol is version four but a move to version six is imminent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.microsoft.com/technet/itsolutions/network/ipv6/introipv6.mspx Introduction to IPv6], Microsoft Corporation, February 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- The main advantage of the new version is that it supports 3.40{{e|38}} addresses compared to 4.29{{e|9}} addresses. The new version also adds support for enhanced security through [[IPSec]] as well as support for [[quality of service|QoS identifiers]].--&gt;

At the transport layer, most communication adopts either the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) or the [[User Datagram Protocol]] (UDP). TCP is used when it is essential every message sent is received by the other computer whereas UDP is used when it is merely desirable. With TCP, packets are retransmitted if they are lost and placed in order before they are presented to higher layers&lt;!-- (this ordering also allows duplicate packets to be eliminated) --&gt;. With UDP, packets are not ordered or retransmitted if lost. Both TCP and UDP packets carry [[TCP and UDP port|port numbers]] with them to specify what application or [[process (computing)|process]] the packet should be handled by.&lt;ref&gt;Stallings, pp 683–702.&lt;/ref&gt; Because certain application-level protocols use [[List of TCP and UDP port numbers|certain ports]], network administrators can manipulate traffic to suit particular requirements. Examples are to restrict Internet access by blocking the traffic destined for a particular port or to affect the performance of certain applications by assigning [[WAN optimization|priority]].

Above the transport layer, there are certain protocols that are sometimes used and loosely fit in the session and presentation layers, most notably the [[Secure Sockets Layer]] (SSL) and [[Transport Layer Security]] (TLS) protocols. These protocols ensure that data transferred between two parties remains completely confidential.&lt;!-- and one or the other is in use when a padlock appears in the address bar of your web browser. Security is generally based upon the principle that eavesdroppers cannot factorize very large numbers that are the composite of two primes without knowing one of the primes.--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;T. Dierks and C. Allen, The TLS Protocol Version 1.0, RFC 2246, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--Another protocol that loosely fits in the session and presentation layers is the [[Real-time Transport Protocol]] (RTP) most notably used to stream QuickTime.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~hgs/rtp/ RTP: About RTP and the Audio-Video Transport Working], Henning Schulzrinne, July 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt; Finally, at the application layer, are many of the protocols Internet users would be familiar with such as [[HTTP]] (web browsing), [[POP3]] (e-mail), [[File Transfer Protocol|FTP]] (file transfer), [[IRC]] (Internet chat), [[BitTorrent (protocol)|BitTorrent]] (file sharing) and [[XMPP]] (instant messaging).

[[VoIP|Voice over Internet Protocol]] (VoIP) allows data packets to be used for [[synchronous]] voice communications. The data packets are marked as voice type packets and can be prioritized by the network administrators so that the real-time, synchronous conversation is less subject to contention with other types of data traffic which can be delayed (i.e. file transfer or email) or buffered in advance (i.e. audio and video) without detriment. That prioritization is fine when the network has sufficient capacity for all the VoIP calls taking place at the same time and the network is enabled for prioritization i.e. a private corporate style network, but the Internet is not generally managed in this way and so there can be a big difference in the quality of VoIP calls over a private network and over the public Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.telecomsadvice.org.uk/infosheets/voip_voice_over_internet_protocol_and_internet_telephony.htm|title= VoIP, Voice over Internet Protocol and Internet telephone calls|last= Multimedia|first= Crucible|date= 7 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Local area networks and wide area networks ===
Despite the growth of the Internet, the characteristics of [[local area network]]s (LANs)--computer networks that do not extend beyond a few kilometers—remain distinct. This is because networks on this scale do not require all the features associated with larger networks and are often more cost-effective and efficient without them. When they are not connected with the Internet, they also have the advantages of privacy and security. However, purposefully lacking a direct connection to the Internet does not provide assured protection from hackers, military forces, or economic powers. These threats exist if there are any methods for connecting remotely to the LAN.

[[Wide area network]]s (WANs) are private computer networks that may extend for thousands of kilometers. Once again, some of their advantages include privacy and security. Prime users of private LANs and WANs include armed forces and intelligence agencies that must keep their information secure and secret.

In the mid-1980s, several sets of communication protocols emerged to fill the gaps between the data-link layer and the application layer of the [[OSI reference model]]. These included [[Appletalk]], [[IPX]], and [[NetBIOS]] with the dominant protocol set during the early 1990s being IPX due to its popularity with [[MS-DOS]] users. [[TCP/IP]] existed at this point, but it was typically only used by large government and research facilities.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Michael (2000). ''Understanding the Network'' ([http://www.informit.com/content/images/0735709777/samplechapter/0735709777.pdf The Networker's Guide to AppleTalk, IPX, and NetBIOS]), SAMS Publishing, {{ISBN|0-7357-0977-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

As the Internet grew in popularity and its traffic was required to be routed into private networks, the TCP/IP protocols replaced existing local area network technologies. Additional technologies, such as [[DHCP]], allowed TCP/IP-based computers to self-configure in the network. Such functions also existed in the AppleTalk/ IPX/ NetBIOS protocol sets.&lt;ref&gt;Ralph Droms, [http://www.dhcp.org/ Resources for DHCP] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070704061131/http://www.dhcp.org/ |date=4 July 2007 }}, November 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

Whereas Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) or Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) are typical data-link protocols for larger networks such as WANs; Ethernet and [[IBM token ring|Token Ring]] are typical data-link protocols for LANs. These protocols differ from the former protocols in that they are simpler, e.g., they omit features such as [[quality of service]] guarantees, and offer [[carrier sense multiple access with collision detection|collision prevention]]. Both of these differences allow for more economical systems.&lt;ref&gt;Stallings, pp. 500–526.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the modest popularity of IBM Token Ring in the 1980s and 1990s, virtually all LANs now use either wired or wireless Ethernet facilities. At the physical layer, most wired Ethernet implementations use [[twisted pair|copper twisted-pair cables]] (including the common [[10BASE-T]] networks). However, some early implementations used heavier coaxial cables and some recent implementations (especially high-speed ones) use optical fibers.&lt;ref&gt;Stallings, pp 514–516.&lt;/ref&gt; When optic fibers are used, the distinction must be made between multimode fibers and single-mode fibers. [[Multi-mode optical fiber|Multimode fibers]] can be thought of as thicker optical fibers that are cheaper to manufacture devices for, but that suffers from less usable bandwidth and worse attenuation – implying poorer long-distance performance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arcelect.com/fibercable.htm Fiber Optic Cable Tutorial], Arc Electronics. Retrieved June 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Transmission capacity ==
The effective capacity to exchange information worldwide through two-way telecommunication networks grew from 281 [[petabytes]] of (optimally compressed) information in 1986, to 471 petabytes in 1993, to 2.2 (optimally compressed) [[exabytes]] in 2000, and to 65 (optimally compressed) exabytes in 2007.&lt;ref name="HilbertLopez2011"&gt;[http://www.sciencemag.org/content/332/6025/60 "The World’s Technological Capacity to Store, Communicate, and Compute Information"], Martin Hilbert and Priscila López (2011), [[Science (journal)|Science]], 332(6025), 60–65; free access to the study through here: martinhilbert.net/WorldInfoCapacity.html&lt;/ref&gt; This is the informational equivalent of two newspaper pages per person per day in 1986, and six entire newspapers per person per day by 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ideas.economist.com/video/giant-sifting-sound-0 "video animation The Economist"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118072720/http://ideas.economist.com/video/giant-sifting-sound-0 |date=18 January 2012 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Given this growth, telecommunications play an increasingly important role in the world economy and the global telecommunications industry was about a [[United States dollar|$]]4.7&amp;nbsp;trillion sector in 2012.&lt;ref name="plunkettresearch01"&gt;[http://www.plunkettresearch.com/Telecommunications/TelecommunicationsStatistics/tabid/96/Default.aspx Worldwide Telecommunications Industry Revenues] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100328045302/http://www.plunkettresearch.com/Telecommunications/TelecommunicationsStatistics/tabid/96/Default.aspx |date=28 March 2010 }}, Internet Engineering Task Force, June 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="plunkettresearch02"&gt;[http://www.plunkettresearch.com/telecommunications-market-research/industry-and-business-data/statistics Introduction to the Telecommunications Industry], Internet Engineering Task Force, June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The service revenue of the global telecommunications industry was estimated to be $1.5&amp;nbsp;trillion in 2010, corresponding to 2.4% of the world's [[gross domestic product]] (GDP).&lt;ref name="plunkettresearch01" /&gt;

'''We the People''', launched September 22, 2011,&lt;ref name="White House Blog"&gt;[http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2011/09/22/petition-white-house-we-people White House blog press release regarding the new "We the People" petitioning platform]&lt;/ref&gt; was a section of the [[whitehouse.gov]] website (under [[President of the United States|President]] [[Barack Obama]]) for [[Right to petition|petitioning]] the administration's policy experts. Petitions that met a certain threshold of signatures were typically reviewed by Administration officials who prepared and issued official responses, however, this was not always the case.&lt;ref name="White House Blog" /&gt;  Criminal justice proceedings in the United States and other processes of the federal government are not subject to White House website petitions.  We the People, rather, served as a public relations device for the Obama administration to provide a venue for citizens to express themselves.  On August 23, 2012, the White House Director of Digital Strategy [[Macon Phillips]] released the source code for the platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Phillips|first=Macon|title=We the Coders: Open-Sourcing We the People, the White House's Online Petitions System|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2012/08/23/open-sourcing-we-the-people|work=The White House Blog|accessdate=August 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[source code]] is available on [[GitHub]], and lists both public domain status as [[Copyright status of work by the U.S. government|a work of the U.S. federal government]] and licensing under the [[GPL v2]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=We the People GitHub repository|url=https://github.com/WhiteHouse/petitions/blob/7.x-1.x/README.md#license|publisher=[[GitHub]]|accessdate=February 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 19, 2017, the [[Presidency of Donald Trump|Trump administration]] announced its intention to shut down the website and replace it with a "new platform would save taxpayers more than $1m a year." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=White House to 'temporarily' shut petition website|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-42409634|website=BBC|publisher=BBC|accessdate=19 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As of May 2018, the site is operating as it was before it shut down.

==Overview==
Users who wish to create a petition are required to register a free whitehouse.gov account. To sign a petition, users only need to provide their name and their email address, and they will receive an email with a link that they must click to confirm their signature. It is not necessary to have a whitehouse.gov account to sign a petition.

Under the Obama administration's rules, a petition had to reach 150 signatures ([[Dunbar's Number]]) within 30 days to be searchable on WhiteHouse.gov, according to [[Tom Cochran (technologist)|Tom Cochran]], former director of digital technology.&lt;ref name="cochranrecode"&gt;{{cite web|first=Tom|last=Cochran|authorlink=Tom Cochran (technologist)|url=https://www.recode.net/2016/12/1/13765002/president-obama-digital-trump-administration-open-source|title=Farewell to Obama, our first digital president|publisher=Recode|date=December 1, 2016|accessdate=February 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It had to reach 100,000 signatures within 30 days to receive an official response.&lt;ref name="TOS"&gt;[https://wwws.whitehouse.gov/petitions#!/how-why/terms-participation ''We the People'' terms of participation page], whitehouse.gov&lt;/ref&gt; The original threshold was set at 5,000 signatures on September 1, 2011,&lt;ref name="whblog2"&gt;{{cite web|first=Macon|last=Phillips|authorlink=Macon Phillips|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2011/09/01/we-people-announcing-white-house-petitions-how-they-work|title=We the People: Announcing White House Petitions &amp; How They Work|publisher=whitehouse.gov|date=September 1, 2011|accessdate=February 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; was raised to 25,000 on October 3, 2011,&lt;ref name="whblog20111003"&gt;{{cite web|first=Macon |last=Phillips|authorlink=Macon Phillips|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2011/10/03/good-problem-have-raising-signature-threshold-white-house-petitions|title=A good problem to have: Raising the signature threshold for White House petitions|publisher=whitehouse.gov|date=October 3, 2011|accessdate=August 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and raised again to 100,000 as of January 15, 2013.&lt;ref name="whblog3"&gt;{{cite web|first=Macon|last=Phillips|authorlink=Macon Phillips|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2013/01/15/why-we-re-raising-signature-threshold-we-people|title=Why We're Raising the Signature Threshold for We the People|publisher=whitehouse.gov|date=January 15, 2013|accessdate=February 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The White House typically would not comment when a petition concerned an ongoing investigation.&lt;ref name=20130310WPeilperin&gt;Eilperin, Juliet (June 10, 2013).

"It's unclear whether Trump's advisors will make a tradition of publicly responding to petitions from the American people," Dell Cameron wrote for the Daily Dot on the day that Trump was inaugurated,&lt;ref name="dailydot"&gt;{{cite web|first=Dell|last=Cameron|url=http://www.dailydot.com/layer8/white-house-petitions-president-trump|title=Trump's team removes all old, pending 'We the People' petitions|publisher=Daily Dot|date=January 20, 2017|accessdate=January 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; noting that the Trump administration that same day "archived" (that is, deactivated) all petitions in progress on the 'We the People' site. New petitions were created, but only two petitions—both created on Inauguration Day—soared above the 100,000-signature threshold within the Trump administration's first week, while other petitions created subsequently seemed not to count signatures at all.&lt;ref name="disruptivedissertation"&gt;{{cite web|first=Tucker|last=Lieberman|url=http://disruptivedissertation.blogspot.com/2017/01/under-trump-administration-we-people.html|title=Under Trump administration, 'We the People' White House petition website is mysteriously broken|publisher=Disruptive Dissertation|date=January 28, 2017|accessdate=January 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The website was later fixed to count signatures but the Trump administration did not respond to any of the petitions until March 2018.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/22/15022050/donald-trump-white-house-petition-we-the-people-update Will Donald Trump keep the White House petition site alive?] The Verge, March 22, 2017&lt;br/&gt;https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/20/17143536/white-house-we-the-people-online-petition-answers-back&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable petitions==

===Death Star===
In November 2012, a petition was created urging the government to create a [[Death Star]] as an economic stimulus and job creation measure gained more than 25,000 signatures, enough to qualify for an official response. The official (tongue-in-cheek) response released in January 2013&lt;ref name="Wired-20130111"&gt;{{cite web |last=Shawcross |first=Paul |title=This Isn't the Petition Response You're Looking For |url=https://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2013/01/white-house-death-star/ |date=January 11, 2013 |work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |accessdate=January 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; noted that the cost of building a real Death Star has been estimated at $852 quadrillion and at current rates of steel production, would not be ready for more than 833,000 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/white-house-rejects-death-star-petition-doomsday-devices-us-could-build-instead-1014682|title=White House Rejects Death Star Petition: Doomsday Devices US Could Build Instead|date=January 15, 2013|work=International Business Times|accessdate=March 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The response also noted that "the Administration does not support blowing up planets" and questions funding a weapon "with a fundamental flaw that can be exploited by a one-man starship" as reasons for denying the petition.&lt;ref name="Wired-20130111" /&gt;&lt;ref name="deathstar"&gt;{{cite web|title=It's a trap!

===Newtown shooting===
Following the [[Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting|spree shooting in Newtown, Connecticut]] on December 14, 2012, a petition for new gun-control measures achieved 100,000 signatures within 24 hours.&lt;ref name=20130310WPeilperin /&gt;

===Cell phone unlocking bill===
In February 2013, a petition started by [[OpenSignal]] co-founder and digital rights activist [[Sina Khanifar]] reached the 100,000-signature threshold required for a response from the White House.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2014/08/15/heres-how-cell-phone-unlocking-became-legal|title=Here's How Cell Phone Unlocking Became Legal|work=The White House|accessdate=March 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two weeks later, the Obama administration issued a response urging the FCC and Congress to take and legalize [[cell phone unlocking]]. A year later, Congress passed the [[Unlocking Consumer Choice and Wireless Competition Act]], the first piece of legislation driven by an online petition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2014/08/01/answering-publics-call|title=Answering the Public's Call|work=The White House|accessdate=March 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill was signed into law by President Obama on August 1, 2014.

===Prosecute 47 senators under the Logan Act===
In March 2015, as the United States and the [[P5+1]] group were negotiating with [[Iran]] on an [[Comprehensive agreement on Iranian nuclear program|agreement to restrain Iran's nuclear program]], 47 Republican [[United States Senate|Senators]] sent an open letter to the leaders of Iran strongly suggesting that a future president or Congress could nullify any such agreement. This action was widely construed as deliberate interference with the negotiations, and possibly a violation of the [[Logan Act]].&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/mar/13/republican-senators-wrote-iran-guilty-crime-maybe "Were 47 Republican senators who wrote to Iran guilty of a crime?"], Ben Jacobs, ''[[The Guardian]],'' March 13, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; In response, several similar petitions were posted on March 9, 2015. One petition, entitled ''"File charges against the 47 U.S. Senators in violation of the Logan Act in attempting to undermine a nuclear agreement"'', passed the 100,000-signature threshold within one day. The petition had reached the number 1 spot, garnering more than 320,000 signatures by April 8, 2015, more than three times the number of signatures required to qualify for a response from the White House. For a variety of reasons, however, pundits, news analysts and legal scholars are largely skeptical that the petition will receive a favorable response leading to the requested prosecutions.&lt;ref name="Guardian"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ABC News Cover"&gt;ABC News.com, [http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/iran-letter-165000-sign-petition-prosecute-gop-senators/story?id=29564985 / "Iran Letter: 165,000+ Sign Petition to Prosecute GOP Senators for Treason"], Katelyn Marmon, Retrieved March 12, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bloomberg"&gt;Bloomberg.com, [https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2015-03-12/can-231-445-people-who-want-tom-cotton-tried-for-treason-be-wrong-yes-/"Can 231,445 People Who Want Tom Cotton Tried for Treason Be Wrong?"], David Weigel, Retrieved March 12, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Huffington"&gt;Huffington Post, [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/monica-bauer/the-logan-act-and-the-treason-meme-click-bait-for-liberals_b_6849040.html/ "The Logan Act and the Treason Meme: Click Bait for Liberals"], Monica Bauer, Retrieved March 12, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NPR Debate"&gt;NPR.com, [https://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2015/03/11/392323244/why-the-gop-iran-letter-is-spurring-debate-over-an-18th-century-law/ "Why The GOP Iran Letter Is Spurring Debate Over An 18th Century Law"], Miles Parks, Retrieved March 12, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trump taxes===
"Within hours"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2017/01/20/politics/obama-white-house-website/index.html |title=What happened to Obama's White House website? |author=Tal Kopan| date=January 20, 2017| access-date=January 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; of President [[Donald Trump]]'s [[Inauguration of Donald Trump|inauguration]] on January 20, 2017, two petitions had been started on the site. One, for the release of his taxes, "with all information needed to verify emoluments clause compliance" reached the 100,000 signature threshold within twenty-four hours.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/316382-petition-demanding-trumps-tax-returns-gets-record-number-of|title=Petition for Trump's tax returns gets record number of signatures|last=Greenwood|first=Max|date=26 January 2017|work=[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]|access-date=27 January 2017|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another, for the President to divest himself of his assets or put them in a blind trust, had some seventy-seven thousand. On January 22, Presidential aide [[Kellyanne Conway]] declared that the tax returns will not be released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/22/us/politics/donald-trump-tax-returns.html?_r=0|title=Trump Won't Release His Tax Returns, a Top Aide Says|date=January 22, 2017|publisher=New York Times|last1=Davis|first1=Julie Hershfeld|accessdate=January 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 27, the petitions had over 385,000 and 119,000 signatures, respectively, with the former being a record number of signatures for any petition on the site. By the February 17 deadline to reach 100,000 signatures, it had exceeded one million signatures, making it the first petition on the site to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Manning|first1=Allee|last2=Kelly|first2=Kaitlyn|title=One Million People Demand Trump's Tax Return, Smashing Petition Record|url=http://www.vocativ.com/403165/we-the-people-petition-white-house-trump-taxes/|accessdate=February 17, 2017|work=Vocativ|date=February 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===[[Antifa (United States)|American Antifa]]===
In August 2017, a petition requesting that "AntiFa" be classified by the Pentagon as a terrorist organization was launched. The petition had over 100,000 signatures within three days. The final count before White House responded was 368,423. The originator of the "AntiFa" petition, who goes by the pseudonym "Microchip", remarked to ''[[Politico]]'' that getting conservatives to share and discuss the petition was the entire point, rather than prompting any concrete action by the government.&lt;ref name="Spurious We the People petition"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2017/08/24/antifa-white-house-petition-trump-troll-241990|title=White House 'antifa' petition written by pro-Trump troll|last=Musgrave|first=Shawn|date=August 24, 2017|work=Politico|accessdate=August 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The White House responded to the petition, stating "Although Federal law provides a mechanism to designate and sanction ''foreign'' terrorist organizations and foreign state sponsors of terrorism, there is currently no analogous mechanism for formally designating ''domestic'' terrorist organizations. Nonetheless, law enforcement has many tools at its disposal to address violent individuals and groups." (emphasis added)&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/20/17143536/white-house-we-the-people-online-petition-answers-back&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Concerns about the efficacy of We the People have been raised since before the first White House responses were published.&lt;ref name="forbes1"&gt;Forbes.com, [https://www.forbes.com/sites/kashmirhill/2011/09/23/what-the-people-want-abolishment-of-the-tsa-and-marijuana-legalization/ "What The People Want: Abolishment of the TSA and Marijuana Legalization"], Kashmir Hill&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 13, 2013, the ''[[Washington Post]]'' website published an article about 30 petitions that had been left unanswered for an average of 240 days despite each having met the signature goals. The article refers to the website www.whpetitions.info for taking "its own tally and highlights petitions that have received enough signatures but have not received responses."&lt;ref name="washingtonpost"&gt;WashingtonPost.com, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2013/08/13/here-are-the-30-questions-the-white-house-doesnt-want-to-answer/ "Here are the 30 questions the White House doesn’t seem to want to answer"], Andrea Peterson&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 16 October 2016, 323 White House petitions have met their signature thresholds.  The White House has responded to 321 of them (99%) with an average response time of 117 days.  Average waiting time so far for two unanswered petitions: 23 days, according to whpetitions.info.&lt;ref&gt;[http://whpetitions.info/ whpetitions.info]&lt;/ref&gt;  The total number of petitions created and percent that have reached an actionable level beyond a response are unable to be determined at this time.

Criticism has been directed{{by whom|date=February 2015}} at the choice of administration official to answer the petitions regarding the legalization of marijuana. [[Gil Kerlikowske]], the Director of the [[Office of National Drug Control Policy]], was chosen to craft the administration's response.&lt;ref name="WH-Response1"&gt;whitehouse.gov, [https://wwws.whitehouse.gov/petitions#!/response/what-we-have-say-about-legalizing-marijuana We The People petition response, What We Have to Say About Legalizing Marijuana], Gil Kerlikowske&lt;/ref&gt; The criticism stems from the Office of National Drug Control Policy Reauthorization Act of 1998, which states that the Director must oppose all attempts to legalize the use of illicit drugs in any form.&lt;ref name="ONDCP Reauthorization Act of 1998"&gt;Office of National Drug Control Policy Reauthorization Act of 1998, [http://www.whitehouse.gov/ondcp/reauthorization-act Title VII Sec. 704(b)(12)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="redbook.gao.gov1"&gt;redbook.gao.gov, [http://redbook.gao.gov/17/fl0083064.php Application of Anti-Lobbying Laws to the Office of National Drug Control Policy's Open Letter to State Level Prosecutors], B-301022, March 10, 2004, Anthony H. Gamboa&lt;/ref&gt;

Other discussions of We the People have focused on its technical glitches,&lt;ref name="Huffington Post1"&gt;''The Huffington Post'', [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jh-snider/we-the-people-petition-website_b_1062883.html/ The Case of the Missing White House Petition], October 31, 2011, J.H.

Snider&lt;/ref&gt; There is criticism about the willingness of the administration to answer petitions that meet the threshold for response, when several qualifying petitions have been unanswered for months or years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Josh Feldman |date=April 2, 2014|url=http://www.mediaite.com/online/new-white-house-petition-demands-the-white-house-actually-answer-white-house-petitions/ |title=New White House Petition Demands the White House Actually Answer White House Petitions |publisher=MediaIte}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the [[Digital divide in the United States|digital divide]] means that poor communities will have difficulty participating equally in We The People.&lt;ref name="New Statesman"&gt;''New Statesman'', [http://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/voices/2012/04/britains-other-islanders-petition-white-house/ Britain's Other Islanders Petition the White House], April 3, 2012, Sean Carey&lt;/ref&gt;

During the first weeks of the presidency of Donald Trump, ''[[The Independent]]'' and ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' reported that many popular petitions did not appear to be receiving any signatures. Additionally, certain URLs to the petitions led to error pages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hooton|first1=Christopher|title=White House petition to save arts funding not registering signatures|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/president-donald-trump-arts-funding-nea-neh-cpb-prs-npr-petition-white-house-a7541631.html|accessdate=January 30, 2017|work=The Independent|date=January 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=PenzeyMoog|first1=Caitlin|title=White House petitions are basically turned off|url=http://www.avclub.com/article/white-house-petitions-are-basically-turned-249143|accessdate=January 30, 2017|work=The A.V. Club|date=January 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Macon Phillips, the man behind ''We the People'', told ''[[BuzzFeed|BuzzFeed News]]'' that the issue stemmed from issues with its [[Cache (computing)|cache]]. He also thought that Trump's administration "is still trying to get their heads around how it works".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Montgomery|first1=Blake|title=No, Signatures On The White House Petition Site Aren't Intentionally Frozen|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/blakemontgomery/signatures-on-the-white-house-nea-petition-site|accessdate=January 31, 2017|work=BuzzFeed|date=January 27, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
