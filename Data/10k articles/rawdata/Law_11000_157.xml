A '''constitutional referendum''' was held in the [[Central African Republic]] on 21 November 1986, following a military coup in 1981. The new constitution would make the country a [[one-party state]] with the [[Central African Democratic Rally]] as the sole legal party, as well as allowing [[André Kolingba]] to assume the presidency for six years without an election, and abolishing term limits.&lt;ref&gt;[http://africanelections.tripod.com/cf.html Elections in the Central African Republic] African Elections Database&lt;/ref&gt; It was approved by 92.22% of voters with an 87.6% turnout.

Following the referendum, [[Central African Republic parliamentary election, 1987|parliamentary elections]] took place in July 1987.

Founded in 1998, it is based in Kabul, Afghanistan with various regional offices.&lt;ref name="PCWorldGrows"/&gt; The company operates as a subsidiary of [[Telephone Systems International]], which is a joint venture between the [[Ehsan Bayat|Bayat Group]] and the [[Afghan Ministry of Communications]].&lt;ref name=rose/&gt;&lt;ref name="NZ Herald"&gt;http://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&amp;objectid=3006609&lt;/ref&gt; Afghan Wireless launched the first [[4G]] [[LTE (telecommunication)|LTE]] service in Afghanistan in 2017, at which point it was the largest private employer in the country.&lt;ref name="SpectrumLee"/&gt; It has around five million clients&lt;ref name="SpectrumLee"/&gt; and provides coverage in all of Afghanistan's provinces.&lt;ref name="AWCC Press Release Tution"&gt;https://afghan-wireless.com/afghan-wireless-announces-increased-tuition-assistance-for-employees-awcc-employees-enrolled-in-bachelors-and-masters-degree-programs-to-receive-significantly-higher-tuition-rebates-and-discounts/&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Founding and licensing===
In 1998, [[Afghan-American]] telecommunications entrepreneur [[Ehsan Bayat]] won an exclusive license from Afghanistan's [[Taliban]] government to create a joint venture with the country's [[Ministry of Communications and Information Technology (Afghanistan)|Ministry of Communications]],&lt;ref name=rose/&gt; which was given 20% ownership.&lt;ref name=rose/&gt;&lt;ref name="Globe and Mail Jeong"&gt;https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/rob-magazine/the-one-thing-that-works-in-afghanistan-mobile/article17115573/&lt;/ref&gt; The deal had been negotiated by investors from the [[United States]], [[United Kingdom|Britain]], and [[Sweden]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2001/11/26/business/telecommunications-entrepreneur-with-a-colorful-resume.html&lt;/ref&gt; Afghan Wireless Communications Company, or AWCC, was established as a subsidiary of [[Telephone Systems International]],&lt;ref name="NZ Herald"/&gt; and financial backing was provided by the British entrepreneurs Stuart Bentham and Lord Michael Cecil.&lt;ref name=rose/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tapei Times Ringing"&gt;http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/bizfocus/archives/2001/11/27/0000113386&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1999 the Taliban granted Afghan Wireless a 15-year [[monopoly]] on cell phone traffic in Afghanistan,&lt;ref name=rose/&gt; and within the year Afghan Wireless had re-enabled Afghanistan's [[List of country calling codes|international country calling code]].&lt;ref name=rose/&gt; In 1999 and 2000&lt;ref name="Tapei Times Ringing"/&gt; the company set up digital [[telephone exchange]]s in the cities of [[Kabul]] and [[Kandahar]], replacing the outdated manual telephone switchboards that the country's telecommunications had long relied upon.&lt;ref name=rose&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2011/09/preventing-9-11-201109 |title=9/11: The Tapping Point |work=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]] |date=September 2011 |first=David|last=Rose|accessdate=2016-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tapei Times Ringing"/&gt;

Although the Taliban were overthrown by [[United States invasion of Afghanistan|an American invasion in 2001]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/09/business/international/once-a-bright-spot-afghan-telecoms-face-unsustainable-losses.html?_r=0 |title=Once a Bright Spot, Afghan Telecoms Face Unsustainable Losses |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=8 April 2016 |first=Kristina|last=Shevory|accessdate=2016-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Afghan Wireless was nevertheless the first company licensed to provide [[GSM]] wireless service in Afghanistan.&lt;ref name="Radio Liberty"/&gt; With the lifting of the trade embargo, Afghan Wireless brought in technology from American vendors including WorldCom, TECORE Wireless Systems, and AirNet Communications Corporation.&lt;ref name="Radio Liberty"/&gt; Afghan interim leader [[Hamid Karzai]] publicly made the first phone call on April 6, 2002, calling and speaking with the Afghan ambassador to the [[United Nations]] in [[New York City]]. As the network went public using a pre-paid platform, phone booths were set up for those unable to afford cellphones.&lt;ref name="Radio Liberty"&gt;{{cite web

The following year Argent also developed a billing system for the network,&lt;ref name="NZ Herald"/&gt; and competing companies such as [[Roshan (telco)|Roshan]] started to appear.&lt;ref name="Globe and Mail Jeong"/&gt;

===Growth and owner lawsuits===
In 2002 Bayat allegedly attempted to [[Buyout|buy out]] Cecil and Bentham, but the offers were disregarded as "derisory."&lt;ref name=rose/&gt; Bayat and Afghan Wireless subsequently sued Cecil and Bentham for allegedly misappropriating money from the company.&lt;ref name=telegraph/&gt;&lt;ref name=rose/&gt; Cecil, Bentham, and two other founding investors counter-sued, claiming they had not received over £250 million in due shares and alleging "fraud, deceit, [[breach of contract]] and conspiracy."&lt;ref name=telegraph&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/mediatechnologyandtelecoms/telecoms/5395626/Lord-Michael-Cecil-sues-Afghan-billionaire-over-250m-phone-deal.html |title=Lord Michael Cecil sues Afghan billionaire over £250m phone deal |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=27 May 2009 |first=Ben|last=Farmer|accessdate=2016-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case was dismissed from American courts&lt;ref name=cobain/&gt; and ultimately hidden from public records and dismissed in Bayat's favor in British courts&lt;ref name=rose/&gt;&lt;ref name=cobain/&gt; in August 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Telephone Systems International and Ehsanollah Bayat Defeat US$400 Million Claim Brought by Lord Michael Cecil, Stuart Bentham and Alexander Grinling Bringing 9 Years of Litigation to a Close |url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/telephone-systems-international-and-ehsanollah-bayat-defeat-us400-million-claim-brought-by-lord-michael-cecil-stuart-bentham-and-alexander-grinling-bringing-9-years-of-litigation-to-a-close-127533528.html |location=London |publisher=PR Newswire |agency=Paul Hastings LLP |date=11 August 2011 |access-date=2016-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=rose/&gt;

Starting around 2006, Afghan Wireless was one of five companies with towers damaged and destroyed by the Taliban,&lt;ref name="Globe and Mail Jeong"/&gt; with the Taliban demanding that telecommunications companies in the country limit service.&lt;ref name="Telegraph on the Line"&gt;https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1348810/British-businessmen-strike-deal-to-put-Taliban-on-line.html&lt;/ref&gt; The attacks were reported stopped by 2009, with ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' explaining that "public discontent with service disruptions overwhelmed religious or tribal affiliations."&lt;ref name="Globe and Mail Jeong"/&gt; By June 2008, Afghan Wireless reported to have 2 million subscribers across all 34 of [[Provinces of Afghanistan|Afghanistan's provinces]].&lt;ref name="PCWorldGrows"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/147413/article.html |title=Mobile Phone Use Grows in Afghanistan |work=[[PC World]] |date=23 June 2008 |first=Dan|last=Nystedt|accessdate=2016-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company had around 5 million users by 2009.&lt;ref name=telegraph/&gt; In 2011 Afghan Wireless remained partially owned by the [[Afghan Ministry of Communications]], which maintains a 10-20% stake.&lt;ref name=rose/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kabul Press Sued"&gt;https://www.kabulpress.org/article3359.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Allegations of American intelligence links===
In a 2011 report by ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' contributing editor [[David Rose (journalist)|David Rose]], it was alleged that Afghan Wireless was linked to an American intelligence project called Operation Foxden, a [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] and [[National Security Agency]] endeavor to wiretap Afghan Wireless' infrastructure for intelligence gathering on the Taliban regime.&lt;ref name=rose/&gt; Although allegedly authorized to proceed on September 8, 2001, Operation Foxden was rendered moot by the [[September 11 attacks]] and invasion of Afghanistan.&lt;ref name=cobain&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/mar/27/us-intelligence-failure-911-fbi-cia |title=US acted to conceal evidence of intelligence failure before 9/11 |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=27 March 2012 |first=Ian|last=Cobain|accessdate=2016-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=rose/&gt; Rose claimed that in the operation's planning stages, the FBI and NSA helped transfer ownership of Afghan Wireless to a shell company, Netmobile, in [[Liechtenstein]], to circumnavigate the 1999 [[wikisource|Executive Order 13129]] ban on American citizens doing business with the Taliban.&lt;ref name=rose/&gt; In response to the article, Bayat denied that American intelligence agencies were behind the change in ownership, and that "to the contrary, my application for an exemption from U.S. sanctions was denied by the U.S. government." Bayat also denied that he or his companies had acted unlawfully, installed wiretaps, or acted as "an agent, informant or spy."&lt;ref name=rose/&gt;

'''Alcohol laws of [[Turkey]]''' regulate the sale and consumption of [[alcoholic beverages]]. The laws are enforced by the [[Tobacco and Alcohol Market Regulatory Authority]] (TAPDK).

== Background ==
{{see also|Turkish_cuisine#Alcoholic_beverages}}
The consumption of alcohol is [[Islam and alcohol|prohibited in the Islamic faith]], but was practised widely in the ruling class of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. [[Murad IV]] (1612 - 1640) forbade drinking alcohol by law despite being a drinker himself. Turkey has been a [[secularism|secular]] country since its establishment in 1923, and the consumption of [[rakı]] in particular is a significant part of [[Turkish_cuisine#Alcoholic_beverages|Turkey's food culture]]. However, today, 83% of adult Turks report being [[teetotal]], and at 1.5 litres per head, alcohol consumption is the lowest in Europe.&lt;ref name=Letsch/&gt;

==Consumption measures==
===Age limits===
In Turkey, the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages is [[legal drinking age|age limited]] to persons 18 and over. A governmental act imposed in January 2011 restricted the sale of alcohol at various events to persons under 24 years of age rather than 18 as it was previously established. However, the ban was later overturned by the courts.&lt;ref name="wn1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://mysouth.su/2011/05/russian-woman-has-died-in-turkey-from-poisoning-by-counterfeit-alcohol/ |newspaper=World News – Russian opinion |title=Russian woman has died in Turkey from poisoning by counterfeit alcohol |date=2011-05-30 |accessdate=2011-06-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110822221139/http://mysouth.su/2011/05/russian-woman-has-died-in-turkey-from-poisoning-by-counterfeit-alcohol/ |archivedate=2011-08-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Drunk-driving===
Turkey's [[driving under the influence]] law gives a [[blood alcohol content]] limit of 0.05mg/ml (as of January 2013) and 0 for commercial drivers.&lt;ref name="IARD"&gt;{{cite web|title=BAC and BrAC Limits|url=http://www.iard.org/policy-tables/bac-brac-limits/|website=IARD.org|publisher=International Alliance for Responsible Drinking|accessdate=23 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the new 2013 laws, breaching the drunk driving limit is punishable with a six-month driving ban.&lt;ref name=HDN47518/&gt;

==Sales measures==

===Licensing===
Licences are required in Turkey to sell or serve alcohol (including beer); they are administered by the [[Tobacco and Alcohol Market Regulatory Authority]].&lt;ref name=HDN47518/&gt; In 2008 shops with retail licenses were barred from selling alcohol out of its original packaging, preventing the custom of some shops of setting up chairs and tables outside to become de facto small bars.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Guardian]]'', 16 May 2008, [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/may/16/turkey.islam New alcohol law prompts fears for Turkish bar trade]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 the government passed laws limiting retail licenses from 10 pm to 6 am&lt;ref name=Letsch&gt;Constanze Letsch, ''[[The Guardian]]'', 31 May 2013, [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/may/31/turkey-alcohol-laws-istanbul-nightlife Turkey alcohol laws could pull the plug on Istanbul nightlife]&lt;/ref&gt; and banning "student dormitories, health institutions, sports clubs, and all sorts of education institutions and gas stations" from selling alcohol.&lt;ref name=HDN47518/&gt; 185,000 kiosks with alcohol licenses could be affected.&lt;ref name=Hacaolgu&gt;{{cite news|last=Hacaoglu |first=Selcan |url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2013-05-28/erdogan-denies-turkey-s-new-alcohol-curbs-encroach-on-lifestyle |title=Erdogan Denies Turkey's New Alcohol Curbs Encroach on Lifestyle |newspaper=Bloomberg BusinessWeek |date=28 May 2013 |accessdate=2 June 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130608093624/http://www.businessweek.com/news/2013-05-28/erdogan-denies-turkey-s-new-alcohol-curbs-encroach-on-lifestyle |archivedate=8 June 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2013 laws also created additional restrictions on obtaining new licenses. No new licenses would be issued for locations less than 100 metres from a school or mosque. In addition, new licensees would now need to obtain a business permit from the local municipality, and "a tourism document from the Ministry of Culture and Tourism" before applying.&lt;ref name=HDN47518/&gt;

===Tax===
The high tax on the alcoholic beverages, called special consumption tax ({{lang-tr|Özel Tüketim Vergisi}} ÖTV), established first in 2002 and dramatically increased in 2010 by the government of the [[Justice and Development Party (Turkey)|Justice and Development Party]] (AKP), whose leadership is known for their aversion to alcohol,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/n.php?n=0510150916466-2010-05-10 |newspaper=[[Hürriyet]] Daily News &amp; Economic Review |title=AKP, alcohol, and government-engineered social change in Turkey |date=2010-05-10 |accessdate=2011-06-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/n.php?n=turkish-consumers-dizzy-of-excessive-alcohol-tax-2010-10-29|newspaper=[[Hürriyet]] Daily News &amp; Economic Review |title=Turkish consumers dazed by another alcohol tax increase |date=2010-10-29 |accessdate=2011-06-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; led to a significant rise in smuggling and fraud involving alcoholic beverages in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/n.php?n=high-taxes-promote-fraud-in-alcohol-cigarettes-2011-05-05 |newspaper=[[Hürriyet]] Daily News &amp; Economic Review |title=High alcohol, cigarette taxes in Turkey promote smuggling, fraud |date=2011-05-05 |accessdate=2011-06-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bootlegging is blamed for the [[2011 Turkish Riviera mass alcohol poisoning]].

==Advertising and promotion==
In 2013, new laws banned all forms of [[Alcohol advertising|advertising and promotion for alcoholic beverages]], including "promotions, sponsored activities, festivals and free giveaways."&lt;ref name=HDN47518&gt;[[Hurriyet Daily News]], 24 May 2013, [http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/parliament-adopts-controversial-alcohol-restrictions.aspx?pageID=238&amp;nID=47518&amp;NewsCatID=338 Turkish Parliament adopts alcohol restrictions, bans sale between 10 pm and 6 am]&lt;/ref&gt; Beverage companies ran ads criticizing the ban.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]], 12 June 2013, [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-06-11/diageo-facing-raki-trouble-in-turkey-after-booze-ad-ban.html Diageo Facing Raki Trouble in Turkey After Booze-Ad Ban]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;adage.com 1 June 2013, [http://adage.com/article/global-news/alcohol-marketers-farewell-ads-turkey-ads/241819/ Alcohol Marketers Say Farewell to Ads In Turkey--With Ads]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The law also included a requirement to blur depictions of alcoholic beverages on television and in films, as was already done for cigarettes,&lt;ref name=Letsch/&gt; and for bottles to carry health warnings similar to [[tobacco packaging warning messages]].&lt;ref name=HDN47518/&gt;

A 2011 ban by the TADPK on advertising in sports meant the basketball team Efes Pilsen had to change its name to [[Anadolu Efes S.K.]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.efesbasket.org/News/Senior-Team/announcement.aspx Announcement] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324183937/http://en.efesbasket.org/News/Senior-Team/announcement.aspx |date=2012-03-24 }}, efesbasket.org&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6188">The '''Aliens Act 1793''' (33 Geo 3 c 4) was an Act of the Parliament of [[Great Britain]] regulating immigration into the country.

[[French Emigration (1789–1815)|French Emigration (1789-1815)]] refers to the mass movement of citizens from France to neighbouring countries in reaction to the bloodshed and upheaval caused by the [[French Revolution]] and [[Napoleon]]ic rule.  To escape political tensions and save their lives, a number of individuals emigrated from France and settled in the neighbouring countries (chiefly Great Britain, Germany, Austria, and Prussia), however quite a few also went to the United States.  The number of refugees fleeing into Britain reached its climax in autumn of 1792. In September alone, a total of nearly 4000 refugees landed in Britain.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The country appealed to people because it had a channel separating them from the revolutionaries and because it was known for being tolerant.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|title = "La Généreuse Nation!" Britain and the French Emigration 1792 – 1802|url = https://www.academia.edu/2909048/_La_G%25C3%25A9n%25C3%25A9reuse_Nation_Britain_and_the_French_Emigration_1792_1802|website = www.academia.edu|accessdate = 2015-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Emigrants primarily settled in London and Soho, the latter had grown into a thriving French cultural district, complete with French hotels and cuisine, although it had long been a haven for French exiles, housing many thousands of Frenchmen from the last mass migration which occurred in reaction to the [[Edict of Fontainebleau|1685 revocation]] of the [[Edict of Nantes]],&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; and the ensuing [[Foreign Protestants Naturalization Act 1708]].

The uncontrolled influx of foreigners created significant anxiety in government circles. Particularly, the British Government feared the presence of spies and Jacobin agents disguised as refugees in the country. J. W. Bruges, secretary of the Foreign Office, wrote to Lord Grenville on 14 September: "By what I can learn, the majority of these people are of a suspicious description, and very likely either to do mischief of  their own accord, or to be fit  tools  of  those  who  may  be  desirous of creating  confusion".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Additionally, the newspapers during the latter part of 1792 emphasized strong public suspicions of "Frenchmen in England" and demanded that high control and security measures be placed onto Britain.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Therefore, the Act was aimed to protect and strengthen the country internally. It only helped to regulate who lived in the country; it did not prohibit immigrants. It also enforced that aliens be recorded upon arrival and register with the local justice of the peace. More specifically, those who arrived in Great Britain after January 1793 were required to give their names, ranks, occupations, and addresses.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|title = The 1905 Aliens Act {{!}} History Today|url = http://www.historytoday.com/anne-kershen/1905-aliens-act|website = www.historytoday.com|accessdate = 2015-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even those who housed or roomed with an alien had to send similar details. It further held that violators of the act could be held without bail or mainprise, either to be deported or as punishment, a provision that caused critics to decry it as a suspension of ''[[habeas corpus]]''; indeed, its sponsor in Parliament had earlier called it "a bill for suspending the [[Habeas Corpus Act 1679|Habeas Corpus Act]], as far as it should relate to the persons of foreigners."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

During the war period, the Act gave an extraordinary power to the government and placed all foreigners in the country at the mercy of the government. All immigrants feared deportation because of either their political views or security reasons, or, simply because they were regarded as an undesirable persons.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Aliens and Immigrants in England and Wales {{!}} Learn {{!}} FamilySearch.org|url = https://familysearch.org/learn/wiki/en/Aliens_and_Immigrants_in_England_and_Wales#Eighteenth_century|website = familysearch.org|accessdate = 2015-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1748">The '''authorized capital''' of a company (sometimes referred to as the authorized share capital, registered capital or nominal capital, particularly in the United States) is the maximum amount of share capital that the company is authorized by its constitutional documents to issue (allocate) to shareholders. Part of the authorized capital can (and frequently does) remain unissued. The authorized capital can be changed with [[shareholder]]s' approval. The part of the authorized capital which has been issued to shareholders is referred to as the [[issued share capital]] of the company.

The device of the authorized capital is used to limit or control the ability of the directors to issue or allot new shares, which may have consequences in the control of a company or otherwise alter the balance of control between shareholders. Such an issue of shares to new shareholders may also shift the profit distribution balance, for example if new shares are issued at face value and not at market value.

The requirement for a company to have a set authorized capital was abolished in Australia in 2001, and in the United Kingdom, it was abolished under the Companies Act 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Companies Act 2006, note 843 |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/notes/division/10/17/2 |publisher=Government of the United Kingdom|accessdate=8 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8056">'''Bava Batra''' (also '''Baba Batra'''; [[Talmudic Aramaic]]: בבא בתרא "The Last Gate") is the third of the three Talmudic tractates in the [[Talmud]] in the order [[Nezikin]]; it deals with a person's responsibilities and rights as the owner of property.&lt;ref name="Jewish"&gt;{{Jewish Encyclopedia|inline=1|article=BABA BATRA ("The Last Gate")|url=http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/2274-baba-batra|accessdate=February 4, 2013}} Jewish Encyclopedia Bibliography: ''Ḥiddushe Geonim'' on [[Baba Ḳamma]] and [[Bava Metzia|B. Meẓi'a]], [[Salonica]], 1728; ''Ḥiddushe R. [[Shlomo ben Aderet|Solomon b. Adret]]'' on Baba Ḳamma, [[Berlin]], 1756; [[Bezalel Ashkenazi]], ''Shiṭṭah Meḳubbeẓet'' on Baba Ḳamma, Baba Meẓi'a, and Baba Batra; [[Naḥmanides]] (Ramban), Baba Batra; [[Maimonides]], ''[[Mishneh Torah]]'', books xi., xii., xiii.; [[Jacob ben Asher]]i, ''[[Ṭur]] [[Ḥoshen Mishpaṭ]]'', p. cxxxv. to end; Moses Benjamin, ''Ma'aseh Rab'', on The Tales of [[Rabbah bar bar Hana|Rabbah bar Ḥanah]]; E. Guttmacher, ''Ẓaphenath Pa'aneaḥ'', on the same.&lt;/ref&gt; It is part of Judaism's [[Oral Torah|oral law]].  Originally it, together with [[Bava Kamma]] and [[Bava Metzia]], formed a single tractate called ''Nezikin'' (torts or injuries).

This "massekhta" (treatise) is not, like Bava Kamma and Bava Metzia, the exposition of a certain passage in the [[Torah]]. It is divided into ten chapters, the contents of which may be described as follows: (1) Regulations relating to property held by more than one owner (ch. i.); (2) responsibilities of an owner of property with regard to that of his neighbor (ch. ii.); (3) established rights of ownership and rights connected with property (ch. iii.); (4) laws referring to the acquisition of property by purchase (ch. iv.-vii.); (5) laws of inheritance (ch. viii.-ix.); (6) laws concerning documents (ch. x.).&lt;ref name="Jewish"/&gt;

It consists of 176 pages (''dapim''), making it the longest tractate of the Talmud.

==Joint ownership==
1. Joint owners of property may dissolve a partnership and divide the property, if the parties consent, except in the case regarding a volume of the Scriptures, which may not be divided under any circumstances (literally, torn in half). Things which lose their value on division can only be divided if all the owners consent. Except in these cases, either party has a right to insist on a division of the property. In the case where a courtyard ("ḥaẓer") is owned by several partners, each of them has to contribute to the usual requirements of a court; if they divide it, a partition wall or fence must be erected in accordance with certain rules. The previous partners are now neighbors; and their relations are described in chap. ii.&lt;ref name="Jewish"/&gt;

A courtyard less than 8 amot (approx. 18 inches x 8 = 144 inches) can only be divided if both partners agree to the division. Depending on how the Mishnah is read, this division is either with a low row of wooden pegs (which shows that visual trespass is not damaging) or a four amot (approx. 72 inches) high stone wall (which shows that visual trespass is considered damaging). If both partners agree to the stone wall, it is built in the middle. The lesson taught here is that if one partner owns more property, he does not need to contribute more space for the stones of the wall.

2. The fundamental rule about neighboring property is that the owner of the adjoining property must avoid everything that might prove a nuisance to the neighbor, or become a source of injury to the neighbor's property. "The noise of a smith's hammer, of a mill, or of children in school, is not to be considered a nuisance" (ii. 3). Disputes as regards to injury or nuisance are generally settled by the fact of prior or established rights (Ḥazaḳah).&lt;ref name="Jewish"/&gt;

3.  "Ḥazaḳah" (established right, possession de facto) is proved by the undisturbed exercise of such a right during a certain period (three years), in spite of the presence of the rival claimant in the same "land." In this respect [[Israel]] was divided into three "lands" or districts (iii. 2): [[Judea|Judah]], [[Galilee]], and [[Perea (region)|Peræa]].&lt;ref name="Jewish"/&gt;

==Acquisition of property==
4. In the transfer of a house, a court, a winepress, a bath, a township, or a field, much depends on the meaning of these terms, which are fully defined in chap. iv. In the Mishnah similar definitions are given of a boat, a cart, a yoke of oxen, and the like (v. 1-5). In selling the produce of the field care must be taken that there be no deviation from the conditions of the sale as regards quality and quantity, lest the sale be declared invalid ("meḳaḥ ṭa'ut," v. 6-vi. 3). Various problems resulting from the sale of property, of a house, or of a piece of land are discussed in the Mishnah (vi. 4-vii.); among them the sale of land for a burialground for a family, or the undertaking by a workman to prepare it (vi. 8). The burial-place is described as follows: "A cave hewn out in a rock 4 cubits broad and 6 cubits long (or, according to R. Simeon, 6 by 8 cubits); along the length of the cave on each side there are three graves of 4 cubits long, 1 cubit broad, and 7 handbreadths ('ṭefaḥim') high; and 2 such graves in the back of the cave. In front of the cave was the court ('ḥaẓer') 6 by 6 cubits, so as to afford sufficient room for the bier and the persons attending the burial."&lt;ref name="Jewish"/&gt;

==Laws of inheritance==
5.  The laws of inheritance are based on Numbers xxvii. 8-11, as interpreted by tradition. Among these is the rule that the husband inherits the property of his deceased wife, her claim in case of the husband's death being settled in the marriage contract (Ketubah). Another rule gives to the first-born son a double share of his deceased father's property. Thus the [[daughters of Zelophehad]] are said to have claimed, as their father's property, three shares of the Holy Land (which is assumed to have been divided among the 600,000 men brought out of Egypt); namely, the share of Zelophehad and, as a first-born son of Hefer, a double share of the property of his deceased father (viii. 3). These laws do not interfere with the right of a man to donate his property according to his pleasure (viii. 5).&lt;ref name="Jewish"/&gt;

Complicated cases are dealt with in chap. ix.; such as the simultaneous claims of the heirs, the wife, and the creditors of the deceased; or the conflicting claims of the heirs of the husband and of those of the wife, where the husband and wife are found dead at the same time; the heirs of the former contending that she died first, and that by her death her property became the property of the husband; while the other party contends that he died first, and that the wife's heirs inherit her property.&lt;ref name="Jewish"/&gt;

==Regulations about documents==
6. As legal documents are of great importance in the problems dealt with in the three Babas, a chapter is added, containing regulations concerning the writing of such documents. Of these one peculiarity may be mentioned; namely, the difference between "geṭ pashuṭ," a simple, unfolded document, and "geṭ meḳushshar," a folded document. The latter was prepared in the following way: When a line or two had been written the parchment was folded and one witness signed on the back of the document; this operation was repeated as many times as the parties concerned liked. This method, requiring a longer time for the execution of the document, is said to have been originally introduced for the writing of a letter of divorce in the case of hasty and passionate husbands (especially priests who were prevented by law from remarrying their divorced wives), to give them time to calm down (B. B. 160b). The massekta of the three Babas closes with a general remark on the educational value of the study of civil law.&lt;ref name="Jewish"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4743">'''Bill 99''' (R.S.Q., c. E-20.2) is a [[Quebec]] law concerning the consequences of any future referendum on independence; it was enacted in 2000 in response to the enactment of the federal [[Clarity Act]] by the [[Parliament of Canada]]. The full official title of the law is "An Act respecting the exercise of the fundamental rights and prerogatives of the Québec people and the Québec State" ({{lang-fr|Loi sur l'Exercice des droits fondamentaux et des prérogatives du peuple québécois et de l'État du Québec}}). It has no formal short title and so is commonly referred to as "Bill 99", the designation under which it was introduced in the Quebec legislature by the Parti Québécois.

==History==
The Act was introduced by [[Joseph Facal]] to the [[National Assembly of Quebec]] in emergency on 15 December 1999, two days after the introduction of the Clarity Act before the [[House of Commons of Canada]]. It was adopted on 7 December 2000, by a majority of 69 against 41. The bill was opposed by Liberal leader [[Jean Charest]], who would have preferred the National Assembly pass a [[Motion (parliamentary procedure)|motion]] rather than a [[law]].&lt;ref&gt;''Canadian Annual Review of Politics and Public Affairs 1999'', p. 151.&lt;/ref&gt;

Whereas the federal act states that, in the case of a [[referendum]] about the [[secession]] of a Canadian province, the House of Commons has the power to determine afterwards whether the question was clear enough and whether the obtained majority was large enough for the result to be accepted, the provincial act stipulates that Quebecers may determine unilaterally how to exercise their right to choose their political regime, including sovereignty, and that the winning option in a referendum is whichever obtains 50% of the votes plus one. Both acts are mandates given to their respective governments.

While opposed to Bill 99, the opposition Liberal Party tabled a motion agreeing with many of its central provisions, including the right of Quebec to decide any referendum question and the 50%-plus-one rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.assnat.qc.ca/fr/travaux-parlementaires/assemblee-nationale/36-1/journal-debats/20001207/9425.html|title=Journal des débats de l'Assemblée nationale - Assemblée nationale du Québec|website=www.assnat.qc.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The motivating force behind passage of Bill 99 was to ensure that, even in the absence a referendum, Quebec's political fate could result only from decisions made by Quebecers and not by other Canadians.  The constitutional validity of both the Clarity Act and Bill 99 has been questioned, however, with respect to the [[Constitution Act 1867]]'s allocation of legislative powers between the federal and provincial government.

==Legal challenge==

In August 2007, three justices of the [[Quebec Court of Appeal]] unanimously held that Keith Henderson, former Leader of the English-language rights group, the [[Equality Party (Quebec)|Equality Party]], has standing to challenge the legality of the statute, which Quebec Superior Court has dubbed "Bill 99" in the absence of a short title for this particular statute.&lt;ref name="canada.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canada.com/montrealgazette/news/editorial/story.html?id%3D940b6480-253f-47c0-836f-d5d8aed3361e |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-09-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121102140140/http://www.canada.com/montrealgazette/news/editorial/story.html?id=940b6480-253f-47c0-836f-d5d8aed3361e |archivedate=2012-11-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, the [[Quebec Superior Court]] ruled that Bill 99 was constitutional, as its wording did not actually authorize a unilateral declaration of independence.&lt;ref name="MyUser_Cbc.ca_August_15_2017c"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nationalpost.com/news/canada/court-upholds-quebec-law-on-self-determination |title=Court upholds Quebec law on self-determination but says it doesn't give unilateral right to secede - National Post |date= April 19, 2018 |author=Graeme Hamilton |accessdate= April 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Broad Sustainable Building Co., LTD (BSB) ''' (Chinese:远大可建科技) is a construction company&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLiwZ62tpFvnh4eNmGUVCFO4uj_hZJON3b|title = BSB Broad Sustainable Building|date = 11 March 2015|accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a wholly owned subsidiary of [[Broad Group]], specializing in developing [[prefabricated buildings]]. Several of its projects from BSB drew media attention after being erected in weeks, assembling up entire floors in a single day, while reducing costs. One of its projects, which is currently on hold, was to assemble the [[Sky City (Changsha)|Sky City]], a 220 floor building in [[Changsha]] in only 90 days. Once completed, the building can become the tallest in the world. BSB intends to license its technology worldwide and currently has six franchises in China with plans to 150 worldwide.&lt;ref name="mmail" /&gt;

==Projects==
BSB currently has several completed projects. Some of those were filmed in [[time-lapse photography]] and created much media attention.

All BSB building are said to have the following advantages: magnitude 9 earthquake resistance, low cost of construction, high thermal efficiency (leading to low maintenance cost), environment-friendliness (low pollution from construction) and inside air that is 9 times purer than outside air.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110904204745/http://www.broad.com:8089/english/down/en_kj.pdf Profile] AUG. 23, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.broad.com:8089/english/down/from.pdf]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Record breaking projects:

==Sky City==
{{Main|Sky City (Changsha)}}

[[Sky City (Changsha)|Sky City]] was a project in [[Changsha]], designed to build the tallest building in the world, 220 floors tall, using BSB technology in only 90 days. Some media publications put the time to completion at 210 days. The project was to be started on November 2012, but due to a delay in receiving government approval,&lt;ref name="mmail"&gt;[http://www.constructionweekonline.com/article-19593-broad-sticks-to-90-day-worlds-tallest-target/ Broad sticks to 90-day completion target] by John Bambridge on Nov 19, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; that was put back to January 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newsfeed.time.com/2012/11/20/china-plans-to-build-the-worlds-largest-skyscraper-in-just-90-days/?hpt=hp_c4 China Plans to Build the World’s Tallest Building in Just 90 Days | TIME.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  In the end the start date was July 20, 2013, the [[Sky City (Changsha)|Sky City]] [[skyscraper]].&lt;ref name="cnn"&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2013/08/05/business/china-sky-city-skyscraper-index/?iref=obinsite Could world's tallest building bring China to its knees? - CNN.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Cost estimations put the cost of Sky City at $1500/sqm of floor area.&lt;ref name="mmail"/&gt;

==Franchising==
BSB aims to grow by franchising. For a franchise serving 10 million people the franchise fee is $34 million and for a franchise serving 50 million people it is $50 million. Franchise fee must be paid up front.
In addition, franchises in developed countries will pay royalties of $50/sqm of built space while franchises in developing countries will pay only $20/sqm.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20121128091553/http://www.greenprospectsasia.com/content/prefab-sky-city-china-world%E2%80%99s-tallest-building-be-80-days Prefab Sky City in China, world’s tallest building, to be up in 80 days] Stephen Ng, Green Prospects Asia, July 26, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2036">The '''Central Registry of War Criminals and Security Suspects''', more commonly known as '''CROWCASS''', was an organisation set up to assist the [[United Nations]] War Crimes Commission and [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] governments in tracing ex-enemy nationals suspected of committing war crimes or atrocities in Europe during the [[Second World War]]. The organisation was originally set up by the [[Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force]] (SHAEF) in 1945.

In 1947, CROWCASS published a four volume list divided into Germans, Non Germans and two supplementary lists of people suspected of committing war crimes between September 1939 and May 1945. To Allied Nazi hunters the CROWCASS lists became known as the 'Nazi Hunter's Bible'. The lists contain over 60,000 people in all. Not all of them are war criminals (some were simply being sought for interrogation or to act as witnesses), however within the pages of CROWCASS are the alleged perpetrators of tens of thousands of war crimes. Among those on the list are Case Registry No 1: [[Adolf Hitler]] - wanted for murder by [[Poland]], [[Czechoslovakia]] and [[Belgium]].

In 2005, the [[United Kingdom|British]] government sanctioned the publication of the CROWCASS Consolidated Wanted Lists. Originally the lists were not intended to be in the public domain until the year 2023.

'''Charles Joseph''' "'''Charlie'''" '''Angus''' {{post-nominals|country=CAN|MP}} (born November 14, 1962) is a [[Canadians|Canadian]] author, journalist, broadcaster, musician, and politician. A member of the [[New Democratic Party]] (NDP), Angus has been the federal Member of Parliament for the [[Electoral district (Canada)|riding]] of [[Timmins—James Bay]] since winning the [[Canadian federal election, 2004|2004 election]]. He is the NDP critic for [[Minister of Indigenous and Northern Affairs|Indigenous and Northern Affairs (Youth)]],&lt;ref name="NDP.ca"&gt;[https://www.ndp.ca/team] NDP Team, December 15, 2017]&lt;/ref&gt; and ran as a candidate for leadership of the federal NDP in 2017.

==Early life, music, writing, and activism==
Angus was born in [[Timmins]], [[Ontario]]&lt;ref name="Parlinfo"&gt;[http://www2.parl.gc.ca/Parlinfo/Files/Parliamentarian.aspx?Item=50a18bf1-9be3-4563-b657-6af367453ba0 Parliamentarian Information Page. August 22, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; and moved to [[Toronto]] in 1973, where in 1980 he co-founded the [[punk rock]] band [[L'Étranger (band)|L'Étranger]] with childhood friend [[Andrew Cash]]. He performed bass and co-wrote many of the group's songs, which were influenced by the [[The Clash|Clash]] and the group's Catholic [[social justice]] roots.&lt;ref name="punktopol"&gt;[https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/politics/article/987707--andrew-cash-from-punk-to-politics "Andrew Cash: From punk to politics"]. ''[[Toronto Star]]'', May 7, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/the-only-punk-band-ever-reunited-in-the-house-of-commons/ ‘The only punk band ever reunited in the House of Commons’]. ''Maclean's'', Philippe Gohier, May 9, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; [[L'Étranger (band)|L'Étranger]] is best known for their anti-[[apartheid]] single "One People", one of the first independent videos to play on the then-new [[MuchMusic]].&lt;ref name="canoe"&gt;[http://jam.canoe.ca/Music/Pop_Encyclopedia/E/Etranger.html L'Étranger] at [[canoe.ca]]'s Canadian Pop Encyclopedia.&lt;/ref&gt; He later co-founded the [[alternative folk]] group [[Grievous Angels]], garnering much acclaim in the Canadian music scene, including two [[Juno Award]] nominations.&lt;ref name="bio"&gt;About Charlie Angus Member for Timmins James Bay. Biography page from personal website. {{cite web|url=http://www.charlieangus.net/about.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-08-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071009041429/http://www.charlieangus.net/about.php |archivedate=2007-10-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He continues to perform with the group.

Angus was a community activist in Toronto in the 1980s where, along with his wife [[Brit Griffin]], he established a [[Catholic Worker Movement|Catholic Worker]] house, and a homeless shelter for men. He moved to [[Cobalt, Ontario|Cobalt]], Ontario, with his young family in 1990, and in 1995 Brit and Charlie launched ''[[HighGrader]]'', a magazine devoted to Northern Ontario life and culture.  In 1999, he was awarded the Jackie Washington Award by the [[Northern Lights Festival Boréal]] in [[Greater Sudbury|Sudbury]] for his outstanding contributions to Northern Ontario culture.&lt;ref name="bio" /&gt;

He is the author of seven published books, including an admiring biography of [[Les Costello]], the celebrated [[Toronto Maple Leafs]] player who left professional hockey to become a Catholic priest in Timmins.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Charlie Angus. Les Costello: Canada's Flying Father. 2005. Novalis.&lt;/ref&gt; Angus's fifth book, ''Cage Call'', a photo documentary with photographer [[Louie Palu]], was released in 2007 as part of an award from Portland-based PhotoLucida. His sixth book ''Unlikely Radicals: The Story of the Adams Mine Dump War'' was short-listed for the Speakers Book Award, Legislative Assembly of Ontario, 2013, and was the runner-up for the Best Regional Non-Fiction (Canada-East), Independent Publisher Book Awards, 2013.

Angus is a progressive, social justice–oriented member of the [[Roman Catholic Church]], a supporter of the [[Catholic Worker Movement]], and was a longtime columnist for the progressive ''[[Catholic New Times]].'' He became increasingly involved in regional and then federal politics through his organizing efforts in opposition to the [[Adams Mine]] garbage proposal and the disposal of [[Polychlorinated biphenyl|PCBs]] in Northern Ontario.

==Federal politics==
[[File:MP Charlie Angus.jpg|thumb|left|Angus in 2012]]

Angus entered federal politics in the [[Canadian federal election, 2004|2004 election]] as the successful [[New Democratic Party]] candidate in the Ontario riding of [[Timmins—James Bay]], winning election to the [[House of Commons of Canada]] by less than 600 votes. He was re-elected in the [[Canadian federal election, 2006|2006 federal election]] with a majority, over six thousand votes ahead of Liberal challenger Robert Riopelle. Angus was the NDP [[shadow minister|parliamentary critic]] for [[Department of Canadian Heritage|Canadian Heritage]] from 2004 to 2007, and was additionally critic for agriculture from 2004 to 2006.

In 2005, his own priest confronted him, and threatened to deny him [[Communion (Christianity)|Holy Communion]] if he voted with the government and his party to legalize [[same-sex marriage in Canada|same-sex marriage]] by Act of Parliament. Angus stood his ground and was denied communion. &lt;!-- Not excommunicated in the sense that that word implies. By the way does he still attend the same church? --&gt;Angus' treatment provoked widespread public reaction both from those who supported the church's stance, and those who supported Angus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hilltimes.com/html/index.php?display=story&amp;full_path=/2005/march/7/same-sex/&amp;c=1 Francoli, Paco. "NDP MP Angus warned by priest he'll be refused holy communion". ''The Hill Times''. March 7, 2005]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051004054335/http://www.hilltimes.com/html/index.php?display=story&amp;full_path=%2F2005%2Fmarch%2F7%2Fsame-sex%2F&amp;c=1 |date=October 4, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has worked extensively on [[community development]] projects with Canada's [[First Nations]], working as a negotiator and consultant for the [[Algonquin Nation of Quebec]]. He also played a prominent role in calling national attention to the [[Kashechewan First Nation|Kashechewan]] crisis of 2005.

In 2007 he became the critic for [[Public Services and Procurement Canada|Public Works]] and [[Treasury Board]], as well as the NDP spokesman for digital issues such as [[copyright]] and [[internet neutrality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/ndp-calls-for-net-neutrality-1.740683|title=NDP calls for net neutrality|work=CBC News|date=April 21, 2008|accessdate=2014-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, after just two years as a Member of Parliament, the ''[[Toronto Star]]'' selected Angus as one of the ten most effective opposition MPs. He also won "Best Constituent Representative" at the 2007 ''[[Maclean's]]'' Parliamentarian of the Year Awards. Angus was re-elected in both the [[Canadian federal election, 2008|2008 federal election]] and the [[Canadian federal election, 2011|2011 federal election]]. Angus also served as the party's spokesman on privacy, ethics and government accountability. Angus voted against a bill to abolish the [[Canadian Firearms Registry]] in September 2010.&lt;ref name="Sticks"&gt;{{Cite news |last=DeSouza |first=Mike |title=NDP rejects responsibility for killing gun registry |url=https://nationalpost.com/news/give+long+registry+target/3518033/story.html |newspaper=[[National Post]] |date=2010-09-13 |accessdate=2011-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the registry is unpopular with many of his constituents, Angus voted against its abolition based on supportive studies provided by police. He subsequently introduced a [[private member's bill]] to reform the registry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Janice|last=Tibbetts|url=http://www2.canada.com/edmontonjournal/news/story.html?id=76f2da1f-f268-4831-90ee-3d9fa426099b|title=NDP offers gun law compromise|work=Edmonton Journal|date=October 8, 2010|accessdate=2014-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was named to ''Maclean's'' magazine's Power List in 2012 as one of the 25 most influential Canadians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/25-most-important-people-in-ottawa/#charlie|title=The 25 most important people in Ottawa: Charlie Angus|work=Maclean's|date=November 27, 2012|accessdate=2014-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Zoomer Magazine'' has chosen him the third most influential Canadian over the age of 45.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timminstimes.com/2012/09/20/zoomer-magazine-has-kudos-for-charlie-angus/|title=Zoomer Magazine has kudos for Charlie Angus|work=Timmins Times|date=September 20, 2012|accessdate=2014-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, [[CTV News Channel (Canada)|CTV News Channel]]'s ''[[Power Play (Canadian political affairs series)|Power Play]]'' chose him in the top three MPs of the year, along with [[Stephen Harper]] and [[Jack Layton]].

Angus has been an advocate for the rights of First Nation children and was the co-founder of the [[Shannen's Dream]] campaign&amp;nbsp;– named in honour of the late Cree youth leader Shannen Koostachin. In early 2012, Angus' Parliamentary Motion "Shannens Dream" calling for an end to the systemic under-funding of First Nation education passed unanimously through the House of Commons.

After the [[Canadian federal election, 2015|2015 federal election]], he was appointed NDP critic for [[Minister of Indigenous and Northern Affairs|Indigenous and Northern Affairs]] in the [[42nd Canadian Parliament]] and elected Caucus Chair in January 2016.&lt;ref name="NDP 42nd Critics"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/ndp-critics-list-mulcair-thursday-1.3315431 | title=Tom Mulcair taps Nathan Cullen, Charlie Angus, Guy Caron for top critic roles | publisher=[[The Canadian Press]] | work=[[CBC News]] | date=12 November 2015 | accessdate=12 November 2015 | author=Kirkup, Kristy}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also a member of the Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=McGregor|first1=Janyce|title=Meet the Commons committees of the 42nd Parliament|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/house-commons-standing-committees-list-1.3425906|work=CBC News |date=30 January 2016 |accessdate=1 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He resigned from both roles on November 23, 2016 in to prepare for the 2017 [[New Democratic Party leadership election, 2017|New Democratic Party leadership race]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/sudbury/angus-leadership-run-1.3863515 |title=Angus steps down as NDP caucus chair, considers leadership run |work=CBC News |first=Kristy |last=Kirkup |agency=The Canadian Press |date=23 November 2016 |accessdate=24 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On February 20, 2017, Angus officially registered to run in the NDP leadership race to replace [[Tom Mulcair]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.elections.ca/content.aspx?section=pol&amp;document=ndp16&amp;dir=lea/dat&amp;lang=e|title=Information on Leadership Contests|last=|first=|date=|website=Elections Canada|language=en|access-date=2017-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; He placed second with 19.4% of the vote, losing to [[Jagmeet Singh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ballingball|first1=Alex|title=Jagmeet Singh wins the NDP leadership race|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2017/10/01/jagmeet-singh-wins-the-ndp-leadership-race.html|accessdate=1 October 2017|publisher=The Toronto Star|date=1 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It came into force on 26 May 2008. It is effectively the successor to the [[Trade Descriptions Act 1968]], which it largely repeals. It is designed to implement the [[Unfair Commercial Practices Directive]], as part of a common set of European minimum standards for consumer protection.

==Contents==
The Regulations introduce new rules about [[consumer protection]] and the responsibility of businesses to trade fairly. It places a general duty on traders not to trade unfairly. 

The regulations also include a blacklist of 31 banned trading practices.

==Enforcement==
In February 2011, [[Safestyle UK]] became the first company to be prosecuted under the regulations.

The '''conviction rate''' of a [[prosecutor]] or government is the number of convictions divided by the number of criminal cases brought.

==Canada==
In [[Canada]], the national conviction rate is about 97%. This does not include cases in which the charges are dropped,  which comprise about one-third of criminal cases. Absent [[Quebec]],  the province with the lowest conviction rate,  the figure is 99%.&lt;ref&gt;nationalpost.com/news/canada/just-3-of-criminal-cases-end-in-aquittal/&lt;/ref&gt;

==China==
In [[China]], the justice system has a Conviction rate of about 99.9%.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2014/03/11/china-scored-99-9-percent-conviction-rate-last-year/?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.2926d2762d0b&lt;/ref&gt; This has been attributed to the use of torture and other coercive measures to extract confessions and pressure on courts and prosecutors.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/china/12193202/Chinese-courts-convict-more-than-99.9-per-cent-of-defendants.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==India==
The national conviction rate in [[India]] for violations of the [[Indian Penal Code]] is around 46%. This tends to vary state by state. The state with the highest conviction rate is [[Kerala]], at about 84%, while the one with the lowest rate is [[Bihar]], at around 10%.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.deccanchronicle.com/nation/crime/041217/keralas-conviction-rate-double-national-average.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Conviction-rate-up-Kerala-tops-with-over-77/articleshow/48408220.cms&lt;/ref&gt;

==Israel==
The conviction rate in [[Israel]] is around 93%. Around 71.5% of trials end with a conviction on some charges and acquittal on others, while around 21.6% end with a conviction on all charges. This does not include plea bargains and cases where the charges are withdrawn, which make up the vast majority of criminal cases.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4228980,00.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Japan==
In [[Japan]], the [[criminal justice system of Japan|criminal justice system]] has a conviction rate that exceeds 99%,  including guilty plea cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Conviction Rate in the U.S. is 99%? (Amerika no yuzairitsu wa 99%?)|author=Hideki Igeta|publisher=Hanrei Taimuzu|volume=1044|date=Jan 2001|pages=54–59}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has been attributed to low prosecutorial budgets impelling understaffed prosecutors to bring only the most obviously guilty defendants to trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Why Is the Japanese Conviction Rate so High?|author=J. Mark Ramseyer and Eric B. Rasmusen|publisher=The Journal of Legal Studies|volume=30|number=1|date=Jan 2001|pages=53–88}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland==

The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland has three prosecuting bodies that cover different geographic areas. The [[Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service]] for Scotland. In Northern Ireland [[Public Prosecution Service for Northern Ireland]] (PPSNI) and in England and Wales most prosecutions are brought by the [[Crown Prosecution Service]] (CPS). 

The latests figures for 2017/18 in England and Wales show at [[Crown Court]] the conviction rate was 80.0% and at [[Magistrates Court]] the conviction rate was 84.8%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.cps.gov.uk/sites/default/files/documents/publications/Key-Measures-Q3-2017-18.xlsx | work=CPS | title=CPS - Key Performance Measures 2017/18 Q1-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Northern Ireland figures show at Crown Court the conviction rate for 2017/18 was 87.2% and at Magistrates Court it was 79.0%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.ppsni.gov.uk/Branches/PPSNI/PPSNI/Files/Documents/Stats%20and%20Research/Statistical%20Bulletin%20Quarter%201%202017-18%20(1).pdf | work=PPSNI | title=PPSNI - Statistical Bulletin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States==
{{See also|United States incarceration rate|Incarceration in the United States|Overturned convictions in the United States}}
In the [[United States]], the [[U.S. federal court|federal court]] system, the conviction rose from approximately 75 percent to approximately 85% between 1972 and 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Federalizing Crime: Assessing the Impact on the Federal Courts|author=Sara Sun Beale|publisher=Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science|volume=543}}&lt;/ref&gt; For 2012, the [[US Department of Justice]] reported a 93% conviction rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=United States Attorneys’ Annual Statistical Report for Fiscal Year 2012|url=http://www.justice.gov/usao/reading_room/reports/asr2012/12statrpt.pdf|publisher=United States Department of Justice|accessdate=2014-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conviction rate is also high in U.S. state courts. Coughlan writes, "In recent years, the conviction rate has averaged approximately 84% in [[Texas]], 82% in [[California]], 72% in [[New York (state)|New York]], 67% in [[North Carolina]], and 59% in [[Florida]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=In Defense of Unanimous Jury Verdicts: Mistrials, Communication, and Strategic Voting|author=Peter J.

[[File:Use of Deadly Force Authorized (5730792058).jpg|thumb|right|Warning sign at [[Langley Air Force Base|Langley AFB]]]]

'''Deadly force''', also known as '''lethal force''', is [[use of force]] that is likely to cause serious bodily injury or [[death]] to another person. In most jurisdictions, the use of deadly force is justified only under conditions of extreme necessity as a [[wikt:last resort|last resort]], when all lesser means have failed or cannot reasonably be employed.

[[Firearm]]s, [[bladed weapon]]s, [[explosive material|explosive]]s, and [[vehicle]]s are among those [[weapon]]s the use of which is considered deadly force. The use of [[Improvised weapon|non-traditional weapons]] in an offensive manner, such as a [[baseball bat]], sharp pencil, tire iron or other, may also be considered deadly force.&lt;ref name="robertankony" /&gt;

== United States law ==
[[File:Wayne County Sheriff Deputy with Reising submachine gun.JPG|right|thumb|Deputy Sheriff with [[Reising]] submachine gun.]]   
{{Main|Police use of deadly force in the United States}}
The [[United States Armed Forces]] defines deadly force as "force that a person uses causing, or that a person knows or should know would create a substantial risk of causing, death or serious bodily harm or injury".&lt;ref&gt;AFI 31-207 Arming and Use of Force by Air Force Personnel&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="robertankony"&gt;Robert C. Ankony, "Sociological and Criminological Theory: Brief of Theorists, Theories, and Terms," ''CFM Research'', July 2012, page 37.&lt;/ref&gt;
In the [[United States]], the use of deadly force by sworn [[law enforcement officers]] is lawful  when the officer reasonably believes the subject poses a significant threat of serious bodily injury or death to themselves or others.  The use of deadly force by law enforcement is also lawful when used to prevent the escape of a fleeing felon when the officer believes escape would pose a significant threat of serious bodily injury or death to members of the public. Common law allowed officers to use any force necessary to effect a felony arrest but this was narrowed in the ''[[Tennessee v. Garner]]'' ruling in 1985 when the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] said that "deadly force...may not be used unless necessary to prevent the escape and the officer has [[probable cause]] to believe that the suspect poses a significant threat of death or serious bodily harm to the officer or others." &lt;ref name="robertankony" /&gt;

In the 1989 ''[[Graham v. Connor]]'' ruling, the Supreme Court expanded its definition to include "objective reasonableness" standard—not subjective as to what the officer's intent might have been—and it must be judged from the perspective of a reasonable officer at the scene—and its calculus must embody the fact that police officers are often forced to make split-second decisions about the amount of force necessary in a particular situation.&lt;ref name="robertankony" /&gt;

Most [[Law enforcement in the United States|law enforcement agencies]] establish a [[use of force continuum]] starting with simple presence through deadly force. With this model, officers attempt to control subjects and situations with the minimum force necessary. Agencies often have policies limiting the force used to be equal or one step higher on the continuum to the force they are opposing.

A [[civilian]]'s use of deadly force is generally [[justifiable homicide|justified]] if he or she reasonably believe that he or she is or other innocent lives are in imminent danger of death or serious injury.&lt;ref name="robertankony" /&gt;  Justification and affirmative defenses vary by state and may include certain property crimes, specific crimes against children or prevention of sexual assaults. 

[[U.S. law]] requires an investigation whenever a person causes another person's death, but the mechanism for such investigations can vary by state. The investigation develops evidence regarding the use of deadly physical force for the particular state or jurisdiction. An investigation may performed by a local or state police agency and also a civilian agency, such as a county prosecutor or State Attorney General.&lt;ref name="robertankony" /&gt; A report of the findings of such an investigation may be submitted for prosecution and made public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Use of Deadly Force by Law Enforcement Officers|url=http://www.cga.ct.gov/2008/rpt/2008-R-0074.htm|publisher=Chief Attorney|accessdate=28 December 2013|date=February 1, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In relation to motor vehicles ===
In {{cite court
  |litigants=Scott v. Harris
  |vol=
  |reporter=
  |opinion=No. 05-1631

  |court=

  |url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/05-1631.ZS.html
}}, the (U.S. Supreme Court 2007) held that a police officer's attempt to terminate a dangerous high-speed car chase that threatened the lives of innocent bystanders did not violate the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]], even when it places the fleeing [[motorist]] at risk of serious bodily injury or death. In the ''Harris'' case, Officer Scott [[PIT maneuver|applied his police car's push bumper to the rear of the suspect's vehicle]], causing the [[suspect]] vehicle to lose control and crash, resulting in the fleeing suspect being paralyzed from the waist down.&lt;ref name="robertankony" /&gt;

Traditionally, intentional contact between vehicles has been characterized as unlawful deadly force, though some U.S. federal appellate cases have mitigated this precedent. In
{{cite court
  |litigants=Adams v. St. Lucie County Sheriff's Department
  |vol=998
  |reporter=F.2d
  |opinion=923
  |court=11th Cir.
  |date=1993
}},
the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that although fatalities may result from intentional collisions between automobiles such fatalities are infrequent, and therefore unlawful deadly force should not be presumed to be the level of force applied in such incidents; the Adams case was subsequently called into question by
{{cite court
  |litigants=Harris v Coweta County
 |vol=406
  |reporter=F.3d
  |opinion=1307
  |court=11th Cir.
  |date=2005
}}, which in turn was reversed by the U.S. Supreme Court in the ''Scott v. Harris'' case discussed above; the extent to which ''Adams'' can continue to be relied on is uncertain. In the ''Adams'' case, the officer rammed the suspect's vehicle.

In
{{cite court
  |litigants=Donovan v. City of Milwaukee
  |vol=17
  |reporter=F.3d
  |opinion=944
  |court=7th Cir.
  |date=1994
}}, the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals recognized this principle but added that collisions between automobiles and motorcycles frequently lead to the death of the motorcyclist, and therefore a presumption that unlawful deadly force was used in such intentional collisions is more appropriate. In the ''Donovan'' case, the suspect lost control of his motorcycle and became airborne, crashing into the officer's vehicle, which was parked as part of an intercepting roadblock.

The text on the poster is the Geneva Declaration. In front are Prime Minister [[Andrey Lyapchev]] and Metropolitan [[Stefan I of Bulgaria|Stefan of Sofia]]]]
The '''Declaration of the Rights of the Child''', sometimes known as the Geneva Declaration of the Rights of the Child, is an international document promoting child rights, drafted by [[Eglantyne Jebb]] and adopted by the [[League of Nations]] in 1924, and adopted in an extended form by the United Nations in 1959.

==Declaration of the Rights of the Child (1924)==
The text of the document, as published by the [[International Save the Children Union]] in Geneva on 23 February 1923, is as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
#The child must be given the means requisite for its normal development, both materially and spiritually.
#The child that is hungry must be fed, the child that is sick must be nursed, the child that is backward must be helped, the delinquent child must be reclaimed, and the orphan and the waif must be sheltered and succoured.
#The child must be the first to receive relief in times of distress.
#The child must be put in a position to earn a livelihood, and must be protected against every form of exploitation.
#The child must be brought up in the consciousness that its talents must be devoted to the service of its fellow men.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This text was endorsed by the [[League of Nations]] General Assembly on 26 November 1924 as the World Child Welfare Charter, and was the first human rights document approved by an inter-governmental institution.&lt;ref&gt;Trevor Buck, ''International Child Law'' (Routledge, 2014) page 89.&lt;/ref&gt; It was reaffirmed by the League in 1934. Heads of State and Government pledged to incorporate its principles in domestic legislation. In France, it was ordered to be displayed in every school.&lt;ref&gt;Geraldine Van Bueren, ''The International Law on the Rights of the Child'' (Martinus Nijhoff Publishers, 1998) page 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

The original document, in the archives of the city of Geneva, carries the signatures of various international delegates, including Jebb, [[Janusz Korczak]], and [[Gustave Ador]], a former President of the Swiss Confederation.

== History ==
After considering a number of options, including that of drafting an entirely new declaration, the [[United Nations]] resolved in 1946 to adopt the document, in a much expanded version, as its own statement of children's rights. Many different governments were involved in the drafting process. A slightly expanded version, with seven points in place of five, was adopted in 1948.&lt;ref&gt;Sharon Detrick, J. E. Doek, Nigel Cantwell, The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child: A Guide to the "Travaux Préparatoires" (Martinus Nijhoff Publishers, 1992) page 19.&lt;/ref&gt; Then on 20 November 1959 the [[United Nations General Assembly]] adopted a Declaration of the Rights of the Child, based on the structure and contents of the 1924 original, with ten principles. An accompanying resolution, proposed by the delegation of [[Afghanistan]], called on governments to recognise these rights, strive for their acceptance, and publicise the document as widely as possible.&lt;ref&gt;Geraldine Van Bueren, ''The International Law on the Rights of the Child'' (Martinus Nijhoff Publishers, 1998) page 9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UN_ARES1386XIV"&gt;{{UN document |docid=A-RES-1386(XIV) |type=Resolution |body=General Assembly |session=14 |resolution_number=1386 |title=Declaration of the Rights of the Child|date=20 November 1959|accessdate=2008-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This date has been adopted as the [[Universal Children's Day]].

This Declaration was followed in 1989 by the [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]], adopted by the UN General Assembly, 
adopted and opened for signature, ratification and accession by General Assembly resolution 44/25 of 20 November 1989; entry into force 2 September 1990, in accordance with article 49.

'''Displacement ventilation (DV)''' It is a [[room air distribution]] strategy where conditioned outdoor air is supplied at a low velocity from air supply diffusers located near floor level and extracted above the occupied zone, usually at ceiling height.&lt;ref name="Chen" /&gt;

== System design ==
A typical displacement ventilation system, such as one in an office space, supplies conditioned cold air from an [[air handling unit]] (AHU) through a low induction air diffuser. Diffuser types vary by applications. Diffusers can be located against a wall ("wall-mounted"), at the corner of a room ("corner-mounted"), or above the floor but not against a wall ("free-standing").&lt;ref name="REHVA" /&gt; The cool air accelerates because of the
[[buoyancy]] force, spreads in a thin layer over the floor,
reaching a relatively high velocity before rising due to heat exchange with heat sources (e.g., occupants, computers, lights).&lt;ref name="Novoselac" /&gt; Absorbing the heat from heat sources, the cold air becomes warmer and less dense. The density difference between cold air and warm air creates upward convective flows known as [[Plume (hydrodynamics)#Heat|thermal plumes]]. Instead of working as a stand-alone system in interior space, displacement ventilation system can also be coupled with other cooling and heating sources, such as radiant chilled ceilings&lt;ref name="Schiavon" /&gt; or baseboard heating.&lt;ref name="Chen" /&gt;

== History ==
Displacement ventilation was first applied in an [[industrial building]] in Scandinavia in 1978, and has frequently been used in similar applications, as well as office spaces, throughout Scandinavia since that time.&lt;ref name="Chen" /&gt; By 1989, it was estimated that Displacement ventilation comprised the 50% in industrial applications and 25% in offices within Nordic countries.&lt;ref name="Svensson" /&gt; Applications in the United States have not been as widespread as in Scandinavia. Some research has been done to assess the practicality of this application in U.S. markets due to different typical space designs&lt;ref name="Chen" /&gt; and application in hot and humid climates, as well as research to assess the potential indoor environmental quality and energy-saving benefits of this strategy in the U.S. and elsewhere.

== Applications ==
Displacement ventilation has been applied in many famous building such as the [[Suvarnabhumi International Airport]] in Bangkok, Thailand, the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory Flight Projects Center building&lt;ref name="Duderhoff" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.energystar.gov/sites/default/uploads/buildings/old/files/50_Flight_Project_508.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;, and the [[San Francisco International Airport]]&lt;ref&gt;https://www.usgbc.org/articles/san-francisco-airport-aims-achieve-zero-net-energy-usgbc-northern-california&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;https://medium.com/the-fourth-wave/zero-energy-green-building-in-a-data-enlightened-era-70c84300df4c&lt;/ref&gt; Terminal 2 among other applications.

== General characteristics ==

=== Airflow distribution ===
The thermal plumes and supply air from diffusers, which determines the velocity of [[airflow]] at floor level, play an important role in DV systems. It is necessary to carefully set the airflow rate from the diffuser to avoid drafts.

=== Conditioning type ===
Due to the unique properties of thermal stratification, Displacement ventilation is typically used for cooling rather than for heating. In many cases, a separate heating source, such as a radiator or baseboard, is used in during heating periods.&lt;ref name="Chen" /&gt;

=== Space requirement ===
Displacement ventilation is best suited for taller spaces (higher than 3 meters [10 feet]).&lt;ref name="REHVA" /&gt; Standard mixing ventilation may be better suited for smaller spaces where air quality is not as great a concern, such as single-occupant offices, and where the room height is not tall (e.g., lower than 2.3 meters [7.5 feet]).&lt;ref name="REHVA" /&gt;

== Benefits and Limitations ==

=== Local discomfort: vertical temperature difference and draft ===
Displacement ventilation systems are quieter than conventional overhead systems with better ventilation efficiency. Hence, it could enhance indoor air quality and provide desirable acoustic environment. Displacement ventilation systems are appropriate in space where high ventilation is required, such as classrooms, conference rooms, and offices.

Displacement ventilation can be a cause of discomfort due to the large vertical [[temperature gradient]] and drafts.&lt;ref name="ANSIASHRAE" /&gt; According to Melikov and Pitchurov's research, sensations of cold caused by vertical temperature difference and draft are usually occurred at the lower leg/ ankle/ feet region, while warm sensations at the head are reported.&lt;ref name="Melikov" /&gt; The research also indicates, that the draft rating model could predict the draft risk with good accuracy in rooms with displacement ventilation systems.

There is a tradeoff inherent in these two issues: by increasing the flow rate (and the ability to remove greater thermal loads), the vertical temperature gradient can be reduced, but this could increase the risk of drafts.&lt;ref name="Chen" /&gt; Pairing displacement ventilation with radiant chilled ceilings is an effort to mitigate this problem.&lt;ref name="Loveday" /&gt; According to some studies, displacement ventilation systems can only provide acceptable comfort if the corresponding cooling load is less than about 13 Btu/h-sf or 40 W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

=== Indoor air quality ===
One benefit of displacement ventilation is possibly the superior [[Indoor Air Quality|indoor air quality]] achieved with exhausting contaminated air out of the room. Better air quality is achieved when the pollution source is also a heat source.&lt;ref name="Chen" /&gt;&lt;ref name="REHVA" /&gt;

=== Energy consumption ===
Some studies have demonstrated that displacement ventilation may save energy as compared to standard mixing ventilation, depending on the use type of the building, design/massing/orientation, and other factors.&lt;ref name="Chen" /&gt; However, for the evaluation of energy consumption of displacement ventilation, the numerical simulation is the main method, since yearly measurements are too expensive and time consuming. Hence, whether displacement ventilation could help with saving energy is still debated.In general, displacement ventilation is attractive to the core region in a building since no heating is needed. However, the perimeter zones require high cooling energy.

== Design guidelines ==
Different guidelines have been published to provide guidance on designing displacement ventilation systems, including:
* Skistad H., Mundt E., Nielsen P.V., Hagstrom K., Railo J. (2002). Displacement ventilation in Non-Industrial Premises. Federation of European Heating and Air-conditioning Associations.&lt;ref name="REHVA" /&gt;
* Skistad, H. (1994). Displacement ventilation. Research Studies Press, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd., west Sussex. UK.
* Chen, Q. and Glicksman, L. (2003). Performance Evaluation and Development of Design Guidelines for Displacement ventilation. Atlanta: ASHRAE.&lt;ref name="Chen" /&gt;
Among guidelines listed above, the one developed by Chen and Glicksman are aimed specifically at fulfilling U.S. Standard. Below is a brief description of each step of their guideline.&lt;ref name="Chen2003" /&gt;

{{FamilyLaw}}
In the [[common law]] tradition, the [[law]] of '''domestic relations''' is a broad category that encompasses:

* [[divorce]];
* [[property settlement]]s;
* [[alimony]], spousal support, or other maintenance;
* the establishment of [[Paternity (law)|paternity]];
* the establishment or termination of [[parent]]al rights;
* [[child support]];
* [[child custody]];
* [[Contact (law)|visitation]]; 
* [[adoption]]; and
* [[Emancipation of minors]].

In some [[jurisdiction]]s, [[guardianship]]s, [[truancy]], and matters related to [[juvenile delinquency]] are considered part of the law of domestic relations.

Many sorts of dispute fall into this broad category; many people who will not otherwise have any dealings during their lives with the judicial system have domestic relations disputes.  Because of the volume of legal business generated by the law of domestic relations, a number of jurisdictions have established specialized [[court]]s of limited jurisdiction, sometimes called ''[[family court]]s'', which hear domestic cases exclusively.

The [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] was drafted from early 1947 to late 1948 by Drafting Committee the first [[United Nations Commission on Human Rights]]. Further discussion and amendments were made by the Commission on Human Rights, the [[United Nations Economic and Social Council|Economic and Social Council]] and the [[General Assembly of the United Nations]].

While not a member of the drafting committee, the French philosopher [[Jacques Maritain]] was influential in the lead up to the drafting of the Universal Declaration, advocacy for it within UNESCO in 1947-8, and in its subsequent advancement.

== The drafting process ==
[[John Peters Humphrey]] was newly appointed as Director of the Division of Human Rights within the United Nations Secretariat.&lt;ref&gt;Johannes Morsink, The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, University of Pennsylvania Press, p 5&lt;/ref&gt; In this role, he produced the first draft of a list of rights that were to form the basis of the Declaration.

[[File:Portico (PSF).png|thumb|A portico with four columns, which Cassin saw as a metaphor for the format of his draft]]
The underlying structure of the Universal Declaration was introduced in its second draft which was prepared by [[René Cassin]] working from the Humphrey draft.  The structure was influenced by the [[Code Napoleon]], including a preamble and introductory general principles.&lt;ref&gt;Glendon, pp 62-64&lt;/ref&gt;

Cassin compared the Declaration to the [[portico]] of a Greek temple, with a foundation, steps, four columns and a [[pediment]]. Articles 1 and 2 are the foundation blocks, with their principles of dignity, liberty, equality and brotherhood. The seven paragraphs of the preamble, setting out the reasons for the Declaration, are represented by the steps. The main body of the Declaration forms the four columns. The first column (articles 3-11) constitutes rights of the individual, such as the right to life and the prohibition of slavery. The second column (articles 12-17) constitutes the rights of the individual in civil and political society.  The third column (articles 18-21) is concerned with spiritual, public and political freedoms such as freedom of religion and freedom of association.  The fourth column (articles 22-27) sets out social, economic and cultural rights.

In Cassin's model, the last three articles of the Declaration provide the pediment which binds the structure together. These articles are concerned with the duty of the individual to society and the prohibition of use of rights in contravention of the purposes of the United Nations.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Ann Glendon, A World Made New:  Eleanor Roosevelt and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Chapter 10&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cassin draft was submitted to the Commission on Human Rights and was to undergo editing in the Commission, then in further drafts considered by the Third Committee of the United Nations, and finally in a draft before the General Assembly of the United Nations, which ultimately adopted the Declaration on 10 December 1948. The vote for the declaration was 48 to 0 with eight [[abstention]]s: the [[Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic]], [[Czechoslovakia]], the [[People's Republic of Poland]], the [[Kingdom of Saudi Arabia]], the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic]], the [[Union of South Africa]], the [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics]], and the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]].&lt;ref&gt;http://ccnmtl.columbia.edu/projects/mmt/udhr/udhr_general/drafting_history_10.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversies ==
The first controversy to resolve was related to the very origin of the human rights, basically the discussion between the supporters of the concepts of [[natural rights]] (which humans are endowed by [[God]] or [[Nature]]) and [[Positive liberties|positive rights]] (which humans acquire as a result of a rational agreement).&lt;ref name=gj&gt;[http://rl-online.ru/articles/4-03/224.html "РАЗРАБОТКА ВСЕОБЩЕЙ ДЕКЛАРАЦИИ ПРАВ ЧЕЛОВЕКА (1946–1948 ГГ.)"], Глен Джонсон (Glen Johnson &lt;!-- wth is he?--&gt;), ''Развитие личности'' no. 3, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

The second controversy was basically between the positions of the [[Marxist theory]] of the [[Soviet Bloc]] and the [[liberal theory]] of the [[Western World]]. In philosophical terms, the Soviet Bloc criticized the [[individualism|individualist]] stance of the issue, arguing in favor of the [[collectivism]] approach, where the rights of the collective dominate that of an individual. In political terms, the [[Soviet Union]] and its satellites, facing mounting accusations of human rights violations (and defending itself in the "[[And you are lynching Negroes]]" style), argued that the declaration is a mere formality if it would not consider guarantees of economic and social rights. However these objections were of surprisingly little consequence, because the Soviet Block was not very active during the seating of the Commission, perhaps indicating a preestablished decision not to sign the Declaration.&lt;ref name="gj" /&gt;

Another issue is the legal status of the declaration. The majority considered the document to be mainly of moral character. At the same time some participants argued in favor of adding certain legal aspects in terms of [[international law]].&lt;ref name=gj/&gt;

[[British government|British]] representatives in particular were extremely frustrated that the proposal had moral but no legal obligation. (It was not until 1976 that the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] came into force, giving a legal status to most of the Declaration) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = ''Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

{{Elections}}
The '''Election Commission of India''' is an autonomous constitutional authority responsible for administering election processes in [[India]]. The body administers elections to the [[Lok Sabha]], [[Rajya Sabha]], state Legislative Assemblies in India, and the offices of the [[President of India|President]] and [[Vice President of India|Vice President]] in the country.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eci.nic.in/eci_main/ElectoralLaws/HandBooks/The_Presidential_and_Vice-Presidential_Elections_Act-1952.pdf|title=The Presidential and Vice-Presidential Elections Act, 1952 (Act No. 31 of 1952)|last=|first=|date=14 March 1952|website=Election Commission of India|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=No|accessdate=9 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Election Commission operates under the authority of [[Constitution of India|Constitution]] per ''Article 324'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://lawmin.nic.in/olwing/coi/coi-english/Const.Pock%202Pg.Rom8Fsss(21).pdf|title=Part XV of the Constitution of India - Elections - Article 324|last=|first=|date=|website=[[Ministry of Law and Justice (India)|Ministry of Law and Justice]], [[Government of India]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=No|access-date=9 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequently enacted [[Representation of the People Act (India)|Representation of the People Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://lawmin.nic.in/legislative/election/volume%201/representation%20of%20the%20people%20act,%201951.pdf|title=The Representation of the People Act, 1951|last=|first=|date=|website=[[Ministry of Law and Justice (India)|Ministry of Law and Justice]], [[Government of India]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=No|access-date=9 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The commission has the powers under the [[Constitution of India|Constitution]], to act in an appropriate manner when the enacted laws make insufficient provisions to deal with a given situation in the conduct of an election. Being a constitutional authority, Election Commission is amongst the few institutions which function with both autonomy and freedom, along with the country’s [[Supreme Court of India|higher judiciary]], the [[Union Public Service Commission]] and the [[Comptroller and Auditor General of India]].

==Structure==
{{See also|Chief Election Commissioner of India|Election Commissioner of India}}
Originally in 1950, the commission had only a [[Chief Election Commissioner of India|Chief Election Commissioner]]. Two additional Commissioners were appointed to the commission for the first time on 16 October 1989 but they had a very short tenure, ending on 1 January 1990. ''The Election Commissioner Amendment Act, 1989'' made the commission a multi-member body. The concept of a 3-member Commission has been in operation since then, with the decisions being made by a majority vote.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The [[Chief Election Commissioner of India|Chief Election Commissioner]] and the two [[Election Commissioner of India|Election Commissioners]] who are usually [[Indian Administrative Service|retired IAS officers]] draw salaries and allowances as per with those of the Judges of the [[Supreme Court of India]] as per the ''Chief Election Commissioner and other Election Commissioners (Conditions of Service) Rules, 1992''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://lawmin.nic.in/ld/P-ACT/1991/The%20Election%20Commission%20(Conditions%20of%20Service%20of%20Election%20Commissioners%20and%20Transaction%20of%20Business)%20Act,%201991.pdf|title=The Election Commission (Conditions of Service of Election Commissioners and Transaction of Business) Act, 1991 (Act No. 11 of 1991)|last=|first=|date=25 January 1991|website=[[Ministry of Law and Justice (India)|Ministry of Law and Justice]], [[Government of India]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=No|access-date=9 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The commission is served by its secretariat located in [[New Delhi]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eci.nic.in/eci_main1/the_setup.aspx|title=About ECI|last=|first=|date=|website=Election Commission of India|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=No|access-date=9 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Election Commissioners are assisted by Deputy Election Commissioners, who are generally [[Indian Administrative Service|IAS officers]]. They are further assisted by Directors General, Principal Secretaries, and Secretaries and Under Secretaries.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Indian Polity|last=Laxmikanth|first=M|publisher=McGraw Hill|year=2017|isbn=9789352603633|location=|pages=42.5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the state level, Election Commission is assisted by the Chief Electoral Officer of the State, who is an [[Indian Administrative Service|IAS officer]] of [[Principal Secretary (India)|Principal Secretary]] rank. At the district and constituency levels, the [[District collector|District Magistrates]] (in their capacity as District Election Officers), Electoral Registration Officers and Returning Officers perform election work.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Removal from office ===
The [[Chief Election Commissioner of India]] can be [[impeachment|removed]] from his office similar to the removal of a judge of the Supreme Court of India which requires a resolution passed by the [[Parliament of India|Parliament]] with a two-thirds majority in both the [[Lok Sabha]] and the [[Rajya Sabha]] on the grounds of proved misbehavior or incapacity. Other [[Election Commissioner of India|Election Commissioners]] can be removed by the President of India on the recommendation of the [[Chief Election Commissioner of India|Chief Election Commissioner]]. A [[Chief Election Commissioner of India|Chief Election Commissioner]] has never been impeached in India. In 2009, just before the [[Indian general election, 2009|2009 Lok Sabha Elections]], [[Chief Election Commissioner of India|Chief Election Commissioner]] [[N. Gopalaswami]] sent a recommendation to President [[prathibha patil|Prathibha Patil]] to remove [[Election Commissioner of India|Election Commissioner]] [[Navin Chawla]], who was soon to take office as the [[Chief Election Commissioner of India|chief election commissioner]] and to subsequently supervise the Lok Sabha Election, citing his partisan behavior in favor of one political party.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/Chief-Election-Commissioner-Gopalaswami-lsquorecommendsrsquo-removal-of-Navin-Chawla/article16363593.ece|title=Chief Election Commissioner Gopalaswami ‘recommends’ removal of Navin Chawla|last=Ram|first=N.|date=31 January 2009|website=[[The Hindu]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=No|access-date=9 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The President opined that such a recommendation is not binding on the president, and hence rejected it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/President-rejects-Gopalaswamirsquos-report-against-Navin-Chawla/article16628274.ece|title=President rejects Gopalaswami’s report against Navin Chawla|last=|first=|date=2 March 2009|website=[[The Hindu]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=No|access-date=9 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, after Gopalswami's retirement the next month, Chawla became the [[Chief Election Commissioner of India|chief election commissioner]] and supervised the 2009 Lok Sabha Elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/A-job-well-done/article16596673.ece|title=A job well done|last=|first=|date=15 May 2009|website=[[The Hindu]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=No|access-date=9 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{See also|Election Commission of India's Model Code of Conduct}}
One of the most important features of the democratic policy is elections at regular intervals. Holding periodic, free and fair elections are essentials of a democratic system and a part of the basic structure of the Constitution. The Election Commission is regarded as the guardian of elections in the country. In every election, it issues a Model code of Conduct for political parties and candidates to conduct elections in a free and fair manner. The commission issued the code for the first time in 1971 for the [[Indian general election, 1971|5th Lok Sabha elections]] and revised it from time to time. It lays down guidelines for the conduct of political parties and candidates during an election period. However, there have been instances of violation of the code by various political parties with complaints being received for misuse of official machinery by the candidates.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/explained/model-code-is-only-moral-code-but-carries-weight/|title=Model Code is only moral code, but carries weight|last=Chhibber|first=Maneesh|date=5 November 2015|website=[[The Indian Express]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=No|access-date=9 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.prsindia.org/theprsblog/?p=3146|title=Model Code of Conduct and the 2014 General Elections|last=|first=|authors=Joyita|date=14 April 2014|website=[[PRS Legislative Research]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=No|access-date=9 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The code does not have any specific statutory basis but only a persuasive effect.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; It contains the rules of electoral morality.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; However, this lack of statutory backing does not prevent the commission from enforcing it.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.india.com/news/india/uttar-pradesh-assembly-election-2017-dates-announced-by-election-commission-get-schedule-of-polling-and-results-of-up-state-elections-2017-1737457/|title=UP poll dates announced, results on March 11|last=Iqbal|first=Aadil Ikram Zaki|date=4 January 2017|website=India|publisher=[[Essel Group]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=No|access-date=9 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/election-commission-enforces-model-code-of-conduct-in-manipur/story-aIc1xuwpRIrzlcAE9gqrwM.html|title=Election Commission enforces model code of conduct in Manipur|last=|first=|date=5 January 2017|website=[[Hindustan Times]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=No|access-date=9 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.news18.com/news/politics/gujarat-himachal-get-dates-for-assembly-polls-274363.html|title=Gujarat, Himachal get dates for Assembly polls|last=Sharma|first=Test|date=10 October 2007|website=[[CNN-News18|News18]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=No|access-date=9 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A law regarding the registration process for political parties was enacted in 1989 and a number of parties got registered with the commission.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eci.nic.in/eci_main/ElectoralLaws/OrdersNotifications/Registration_of_Political_Party.pdf|title=Registration of political parties under section 29A of the Representation of the People Act, 1951|last=|first=|date=23 March 1992|website=Election Commission of India|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=No|access-date=9 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The registration helps avoid confusion ensures that the political parties are brought under the purview of the commission.

The election commission has the right to allow symbols to the political parties. It gives recognition to the national parties, state parties and regional parties. It set limits on poll expenses. The commission prepare electoral rolls and update the voter's list from time to time. Notifications of dates and schedules of election for filing nominations are issued by the commission. It is noteworthy that Election commission cannot allot same symbol to two regional political parties even if they are not in the same state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eci.nic.in/eci_main/ElectoralLaws/HandBooks/HANDBOOK%20OF%20SYMBOLS.pdf|title=Handbook of  Symbols, 2004|last=|first=|date=2004|website=Election Commission of India|at=Clause 9|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=No|access-date=9 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The commission can issue an order for prohibition of publication and disseminating of results of [[opinion polls]] or [[exit polls]] to prevent influencing the voting trends in the electorate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eci.nic.in/archive/instruction/recent/media/pnxitpoll_FINAL.html|title=Subject - Guidelines for Publication and Dissemination of Results of Opinion Polls/Exit Polls.|last=|first=|date=20 January 1998|website=Election Commission of India|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=No|access-date=9 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/elections/news/election-commission-bans-exit-polls-in-election-bound-states/articleshow/56856902.cms|title=Election Commission bans exit polls in election-bound states|last=|first=|date=29 January 2017|website=[[The Times of India]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=No|access-date=9 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/explained/exit-polls-and-why-they-are-restricted-by-the-panel-dainik-jagran-editor-arrest-4527055/|title=Exit polls and why they are restricted by the panel: All your questions answered|last=Chopra|first=Ritika|date=16 February 2017|website=[[The Indian Express]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=No|access-date=9 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To curb the growing influence of money during elections, the Election Commission has made many suggestions and changes in this regard. The commission has appointed IRS officers of the Income Tax Department as Election Observers (Expenditure) of all elections and has fixed the legal limits on the amount of money which a candidate can spend during election campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/rk-nagar-byelection-observers-appointed/articleshow/57796448.cms|title=RK Nagar byelection: Observers appointed|last=Kumar|first=Pradeep|date=23 March 2017|website=[[The Times of India]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=No|access-date=9 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newindianexpress.com/states/tamil-nadu/2017/mar/31/deployment-of-observers-in-rk-nagar-a-new-national-record-election-commission-1588080.html|title=Deployment of observers in RK Nagar a new national record: Election Commission|last=|first=|date=31 March 2017|website=[[The New Indian Express]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=No|access-date=9 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; These limits have been revised over time. The Election Commission, by appointing expenditure observers from the [[Indian Revenue Service]], keeps an eye on the individual account of election expenditure. The commission takes details of the candidate's assets on affidavit at the time of submitting nomination paper, who are also required to give details of their expenditure within 30 days of the declaration of results. The campaign period has also been reduced by the commission from 21 to 14 days for Lok Sabha and Assembly elections to cut down election expenditure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.legalservicesindia.com/article/article/role-of-election-commission-108-1.html|title=Role Of Election Commission|last=Chandrakant|first=Nagnath|date=29 April 2010|website=Legal Services India|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=No|access-date=9 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eci.nic.in/eci_main1/the_function.aspx#campaign|title=The Function (Electoral System)|last=|first=|date=|website=Election Commission of India|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=No|access-date=9 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an attempt to decriminalise politics, the Election Commission has approached the [[Supreme Court of India|Supreme Court]] to put a lifetime ban on convicted politicians from contesting elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/india/ec-supports-lifetime-ban-on-convicts-from-contesting-4577960/|title=Election Commission supports lifetime ban on convicts from contesting|last=Anand|first=Utkarsh|date=21 March 2017|work=[[The Indian Express]]|access-date=9 September 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=No|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/lifetime-ban-on-convicted-netas-supreme-court-seeks-center-election-commissions-views/articleshow/54338187.cms|title=Lifetime ban on convicted netas: Supreme Court seeks Center, Election Commission's views|last=Rautray|first=Samanwaya|date=15 September 2016|work=[[The Economic Times]]|access-date=9 September 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=No}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modernisation==
The Election Commission had tried to bring improvements in election procedures by the introduction of [[Electronic voting machines]] or EVMs. It was thought that these would reduce malpractices and improve efficiency. It was first tried out on an experimental basis in the state of [[Kerala]] for the 1982 Legislative Assembly Elections. After a successful testing and the legal inquiries, the commission took the decision to begin the use of these voting machines.&lt;ref name="ECI-The setup"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eci.nic.in/eci_main1/the_setup.aspx |title=A Constitutional Body |publisher=Election Commission of India}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Election Commission launched a web site of its own on 28 February 1998 in order to provide accurate information, management, administration and instant results of the elections. In an effort to prevent electoral fraud, in 1993, EPICs or Electors Photo Identity Cards were issued, which became mandatory by the [[Indian general election, 2004|2004 elections]].

The '''Freedom of Internet Act''' (formerly Free Internet Act) is an [[Act of Congress|act]] aimed to legislate the [[Internet]] and its uses worldwide, as an alternative to [[SOPA]] and [[PROTECT IP Act|PIPA]].&lt;ref name="geekosystem" /&gt; The idea was originated in a [[Reddit]] post &lt;ref name="reddit_the_free_internet_act" /&gt; and the act is being developed in a subsection of Reddit specifically created for this purpose. As one of the first instances of crowd sourcing legislation, it has raised questions concerning public participation in government in the 21st century. The act passed January 12, 2012.&lt;ref name="techspot" /&gt;

Early articles by blog site [[Techdirt]]&lt;ref name="techdirt" /&gt; and technology news site [[Techspot]]&lt;ref name="techspot" /&gt; show that there is an interest to see how this proposal will pan out in the wake of the successful Reddit campaign to halt the passage of [[SOPA]] and [[PROTECT IP Act|PIPA]]. Some technology journalists wrote tongue-in-cheek commentaries on the situation.&lt;ref name="itworld" /&gt; Covered by [[RT (TV network)|RT]], [[Alexis Ohanian]], Co-founder of [[Reddit]], explained that

&lt;blockquote&gt;This is definitely a first, but I'll tell you we are in uncharted territory. This is a community that a few years ago decided it was going to be a good idea to have the worlds largest secret santa exchange, and ''did it''.  And entire websites have been devoted to this, and now twice a year you can exchange secret santa gifts with people all across the world. It just kind of works.  And it's this decentralized magic, that has done so much for the SOPA and PIPA fight thus far, yeah I wouldn't put anything past them.  Now there is still a long way to go from great discussions online to actual legislation, but what's really excited is that what's come out of the backlash is that there are legislators, there are senators and representatives who are actually listening.&lt;ref name="ohanian_interview" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Points of Discussion==
In preparation for drafting of the proposed legislation, the community of individuals involved have created threads of discussion and debate dedicated to answering the broad questions associated with legislation of this kind.  The topics include:

===Privacy &lt;ref name="privacy" /&gt;===

Article VII Section B of the Act states that “Everything a user does with their computer is considered private.” Any actions a user takes to protect their privacy, such as using proxies, cannot be assumed to be used for illegal actions.&lt;ref name = "webpronews" /&gt; The Act classifies the following as private data: all data that can personally identify the owner, harm the owner in any way, data that has not been explicitly agreed to be public, and all encrypted data is considered to be private. Additionally, data collected for judicial proceedings must be able to be used as evidence. According to the act: “Any data absorbed during the search for evidence must be returned to its owner within 15 business days. Any copies of data not used as evidence must be permanently deleted and removed from any kind of storage.” &lt;ref name = "googledoc" /&gt; However, content that a user knows is illegal to upload in a given region is not considered private data (for example, child pornography).&lt;ref name = "urbantimes" /&gt; Users who download such data and who neglect to report it are also liable for the data.

===Censorship &lt;ref name="censorship" /&gt;===

The Act proposes that all sovereign Federal and State Governments cannot censor any kind of material on the Internet other than child pornography and financial scams, and in order to censor those topics, it must be done after they are uploaded because it would be illegal to monitor any data while it is being uploaded. Additionally, only the creator or uploader can be held responsible for illegal material, and any time material is removed, the uploader must be notified.
&lt;ref name="wired" /&gt;

===Free Speech &lt;ref name="freespeech" /&gt;===

By prohibiting censorship of the internet, the FIA would carry this most basic American right on to the internet. In the most recent draft of the act, it states that the “FIA will allow internet users to browse freely without any means of censorship, users have the right to free speech and to free knowledge; we govern the content of the internet, governments don’t.”&lt;ref name ="huffington" /&gt;  With no legal government presiding over online content, one would be able to freely post, share, and say whatever one desired on the internet.

===Copyright &lt;ref name="copyright" /&gt;===
Kevin Lincoln, a writer for Business Insider, argued that the Act is extremely weak in protecting copyright because under the act, content that may infringe on copyright can only be policed after it is uploaded.  Only the uploader, not the website hosting possibly illegal content, would be penalized. To prove that someone violated copyright, the accuser must prove that the uploader knew they were uploading illegal content and they didn’t know they were uploading it for Fair Use. The accused person must be notified 30 days before the content is taken down so they have adequate time to fight the claim.&lt;ref name="businessinsider"/&gt; Monitoring of content being downloaded, uploaded or edited would not be allowed without legal permission, and to try to remove content without a court order would be considered against the freedom of speech and the perpetrator would be subject to legal penalty.&lt;ref name="reddit"/&gt;

==Criticism==
Techspot published an article that questioned whether the Reddit community effort would be able to produce a successful bill.&lt;ref name='techspot'/&gt;  A Business Insider article alleges that the proposed bill "is so weak in protecting copyright that it would likely revert the Internet back to a Wild West-type situation where more or less anything goes." The article concludes that the bill would make violation of copyright widespread and copyright litigation difficult due to increased burdens of proof and increased immunity for hosting.&lt;ref name='businessinsider'/&gt;

Inside of Reddit, community members have voiced concern about both the direction of the bill and language used in it, suggesting that the use of the community contributions instead of a professional group to draft the bill will decrease the quality of the bill.&lt;ref name='reddit_criticism'/&gt;

The '''Free Software Song''' is a [[Filk music|filk]] song by [[Richard Stallman|Richard M. Stallman]] about [[free software]].  The song is set to the melody of the [[Bulgarian music|Bulgarian]] "[[Sadi Moma]]".

A version of this song is also performed by a band (the GNU/Stallmans) during the credits of the documentary ''[[Revolution OS]]''.
In 1998, Matt Loper recorded a [[techno]] version of the song.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.jwz.org/blog/2003/08/why-cooperation-with-rms-is-impossible-part-3/ | title=Why Cooperation with RMS is Impossible, Part 3 | date=March 2008 | accessdate=5 July 2013 | author=Zawinski, Jamie}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jono Bacon]] also recorded a [[death metal music|death metal]] version of the song,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.lastfm.com/music/Jono+Bacon/_/Free+Software+Song | title=Jono Bacon - Free Software Song | work=Last.fm | accessdate=5 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the band Fenster recorded a rhythmic version.&lt;ref name="gnu"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.gnu.org/music/free-software-song.html | title=The Free Software Song | work=GNU Operating System | year=1993 | accessdate=2008-10-30 | author=Stallman, Richard}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In addition, there is a Spanish [[pop punk]] version  recorded by ALEC,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artelibreestudio.com.ar/?p=63 |title=Arte Libre Estudio Cooperativo |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101029051520/http://www.artelibreestudio.com.ar/?p=63 |archivedate=October 29, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20110515035918/http://e3.ututo.org/users/musix/ALEC/cancion_software_libre/master/ALEC_Cancion_SL_master.ogg&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[Rick Astley]] [[mashup (music)|mashup]], "Never Gonna Give GNU Up".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.systemed.net/blog/?p=28&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sharing ==
Participating agencies have, through a [[memorandum of understanding]], agreed to "share telephone intelligence information derived from any source with the (task force) including: subpoenaed telephone call detail records, subpoenaed telephone subscriber information, and seized mobile devices."&lt;ref name=wired /&gt;

== Controversy ==
Rob Poggenklass, an [[ACLU]] staff attorney, stated that the program violates Virginia's Government Data Collection and Dissemination Practices Act.  The [[Virginia State Police]] stated that they declined to join, citing the same statute.&lt;ref name=wired /&gt;

== Termination ==

In 2015, Chesapeake asked Virginia Attorney General [[Mark Herring]] for a formal opinion on whether the program was legal under Virginia law.&lt;ref name="dailypress" /&gt;  The official response delivered in November 2015 was that the examination was closed because the program had been terminated.  Newport News Police Chief Rick Myers said that the task force had joined a federal data-sharing program which required search warrants.

Under the law of the [[United Kingdom]], '''high treason''' is the crime of disloyalty to [[the Crown]]. Offences constituting high treason include plotting the murder of the sovereign; committing adultery with the sovereign's [[wikt:consort|consort]], with the sovereign's eldest unmarried daughter, or with the wife of the heir to the throne; levying war against the sovereign and adhering to the sovereign's enemies, giving them aid or comfort; and attempting to undermine the lawfully established [[Line of succession to the British Throne|line of succession]]. Several other crimes have historically been categorised as high treason, including [[counterfeit]]ing money and being a Catholic priest.&lt;ref name="Jesuits, etc. Act 1584"&gt;[[Jesuits, etc. Act 1584]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[High treason]] was generally distinguished from [[petty treason]], a treason committed against a subject of the sovereign, the scope of which was limited by statute to the murder of a legal superior. Petty treason comprised the murder of a master by his servant, of a husband by his wife, or of a bishop. Petty treason ceased to be a distinct offence from murder in 1828, and consequently high treason is today often referred to simply as treason.

Considered to be the most serious of offences, high treason was often met with extraordinary punishment, because it threatened the safety of the state. [[Hanging, drawing and quartering]] was the usual punishment until the 19th century. The last treason trial was that of [[William Joyce]], "[[Lord Haw-Haw]]", who was executed by hanging in 1946.

Since the [[Crime and Disorder Act 1998]] became law, the maximum sentence for treason in the UK has been [[Life imprisonment (England and Wales)|life imprisonment]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/law/2014/oct/17/treason-act-facts-british-extremists-iraq-syria-isis "Treason: The Facts"], ''The Guardian'', 17 October 2014 (retrieved 28 August 2017).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Offences==
High treason today consists of:
* [[Treason Act 1351]] (as amended – last amended by the [[Succession to the Crown Act 2013]]):
**compassing the death of the sovereign, or of the sovereign's wife or eldest child and heir
**violating the sovereign's wife, or the sovereign's eldest unmarried daughter, or the sovereign's eldest son's wife (only if the eldest son is also heir to the throne)
**levying war against the sovereign in the realm
**adhering to the sovereign's enemies, giving them aid and comfort, in the realm or elsewhere
**killing the King's [[Lord Chancellor|Chancellor]], [[Lord High Treasurer|Treasurer]] (an office long in commission) or Justices
* [[Treason Act 1702]] and Treason Act (Ireland) 1703:
**attempting to hinder the [[succession to the British throne|succession to the throne]] under the [[Bill of Rights 1689]] and the [[Act of Settlement 1701]]
* [[Treason Act 1708]]:
**killing the [[Senator of the College of Justice|Lords of Session]] or [[Senator of the College of Justice|Lords of Justiciary]] in Scotland
**(in [[Scots law]] only) counterfeiting the [[Great Seal of Scotland]]

''See the English History section below for detail about the offences created by the 1351 Act.''

In addition to the crime of treason, the [[Treason Felony Act 1848]] (still in force today) created a new offence known as ''treason felony'', with a maximum sentence of life imprisonment instead of [[Capital punishment in the United Kingdom|death]] (but today, due to the abolition of the death penalty, the maximum penalty both for high treason and treason felony would be the same—life imprisonment). Under the traditional categorisation of offences into [[treason]], [[felony|felonies]], and [[misdemeanour]]s, treason felony was merely another form of felony. Several categories of treason which had been introduced by the [[Sedition Act 1661]] were reduced to felonies. While the common law offences of [[misprision]] and [[compounding a felony|compounding]] were abolished in respect of felonies (including treason felony) by the [[Criminal Law Act 1967]], which abolished the distinction between misdemeanour and felony, [[misprision of treason]] and [[compounding treason]] are still offences under the common law.

According to the law in force, it is treason felony to "compass, imagine, invent, devise, or intend":

* to deprive the sovereign of the Crown,
* to levy war against the sovereign "in order by force or constraint to compel her to change her measures or counsels, or in order to put any force or constraint upon or in order to intimidate or overawe both Houses or either House of Parliament", or
* to "move or stir" any foreigner to invade the United Kingdom or any other country belonging to the sovereign.

===Northern Ireland===
In addition to the Acts of 1351, 1703, and 1848, two additional Acts passed by the old [[Parliament of Ireland]] apply to [[Northern Ireland]] alone. The following is also treason:
* [[Treason Act (Ireland) 1537]]:
**attempting bodily harm to the king, queen, or their [[heir apparent|heirs apparent]]
**attempting to deprive them of their title
**publishing that the sovereign is a [[heresy|heretic]], tyrant, infidel or usurper of the Crown
**rebelliously withholding from the sovereign his fortresses, ships, artillery etc.
* [[Crown of Ireland Act 1542]]:
**doing anything to endanger the sovereign's person
**doing anything which might disturb or interrupt the sovereign's possession of the Crown
(Note that although the Irish [[Act of Supremacy 1558#Related legislation|Act of Supremacy (Ireland) 1560]] is still in force,&lt;ref&gt;2 Eliz c. 1&lt;/ref&gt; it is no longer treason to contravene it.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Religious Disabilities Act 1846]] (9 &amp; 10 Vict c. 59), s. 1&lt;/ref&gt;{{Dubious|date=March 2009}})

==History: England and Wales==
In England, there was no clear [[common law]] definition of treason; it was for the king and his judges to determine if an offence constituted treason. Thus, the process became open to abuse, and decisions were often arbitrary. For instance, during the reign of [[Edward III of England|Edward III]], a knight was convicted of treason because he assaulted one of the king's subjects and held him for a ransom of £90. It was only in 1351 that Parliament passed legislation on the subject of treason. Under the [[Treason Act 1351]], or "Statute of Treasons", which distinguished between high and petty treason, several distinct offences constitute high treason; most of them continue to do so, while those relating to [[counterfeit|forgery]] have been relegated to ordinary offences.&lt;ref&gt;Coinage Act 1832 and Forgery Act 1861 (both repealed)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Drawn quartered2.jpg|thumb|260px|To be [[hanged, drawn and quartered]] was from 1351 a penalty in England for common men convicted of high treason.]]
First, it was high treason to "compass or imagine the death of our Lord the King, of our Lady his Queen, or of their eldest son and heir." The terms "compass or imagine" indicate the premeditation of a murder; it would not be high treason to accidentally kill the sovereign or any other member of the Royal Family (though someone could be charged with [[manslaughter]] or [[negligent homicide]]). However it has also been held to include rebelling against or trying to overthrow the monarch, as experience has shown that this normally involves the monarch's death. The terms of this provision have been held to include both male and female sovereigns, but only the spouses of male Sovereigns. It is not sufficient to merely allege that an individual is guilty of high treason because of his thoughts or imaginations; there must be an [[overt act]] indicating the plot.&lt;ref&gt;Kenny, C. ''Outlines of Criminal Law'' (Cambridge University Press, 1936), 15th edition, p. 308&lt;/ref&gt;

A second form of high treason defined by the Treason Act 1351 was having [[sexual intercourse]] with "the King's companion, or the King's eldest daughter unmarried, or the wife of the King's eldest son and heir." If the intercourse is not consensual, only the rapist is liable, but if it is consensual, then both parties are liable. [[Anne Boleyn]] and [[Catherine Howard]], wives of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]], were found guilty of treason for this reason. The jurist [[William Blackstone|Sir William Blackstone]] writes that "the plain intention of this law is to guard the Blood Royal from any suspicion of [[illegitimacy|bastardy]], whereby the succession to the Crown might be rendered dubious." Thus, only women are covered in the statute; it is not, for example, high treason to rape a Queen-Regnant's husband. Similarly, it is not high treason to rape a widow of the sovereign or of the heir-apparent. [[Diana, Princess of Wales]] admitted that she had an affair with her riding instructor, [[James Hewitt]], between 1987 and 1992. As she was then the wife of the [[Prince of Wales]], heir to the throne, this fitted the definition of high treason, and a national newspaper briefly attempted&lt;ref&gt;[http://archives.tcm.ie/businesspost/2005/10/02/story8337.asp The Sunday Business Post Online]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/905239.stm | work=BBC News | title=Editor defends Mirror over Diana letters | date=31 August 2000 | accessdate=4 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; to have Hewitt prosecuted for what was then still a capital offence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iht.com/articles/1994/10/05/royale.php The New York Times]&lt;/ref&gt;

It is high treason "if a man do levy war against our Lord the King in his realm" or "if a man be adherent to the King's enemies in his realm, giving to them aid and comfort in the realm or elsewhere." Conspiracy to levy war or aid the sovereign's enemies do not amount to this kind of treason, though it may be encompassing the Sovereign's death. In modern times only these kinds of treason have actually been prosecuted (during the [[World Wars]] and the [[Easter Rising]]).

The Treason Act 1351 made it high treason to "slay the [[Lord Chancellor|Chancellor]], [[Lord High Treasurer|Treasurer]], or the King's justices of the one bench or the other, [[Justice in Eyre|justices in eyre]], or justices of [[assize]], and all other justices assigned to hear and determine, being in their places doing their offices."

The last types of high treason defined by the Treason Act 1351 were the forgery of the [[Great Seal of the Realm|Great Seal]] or [[Privy Seal]], the counterfeiting of English (later British) money and the importing of money known to be counterfeit. These offences, however, were reduced to [[felony|felonies]] rather than high treasons in 1861 and 1832 respectively.

Finally, the Treason Act 1351 specified that the listing of offences was meant to be exhaustive. Only Parliament, not the courts, could add to the list. It provided that if "other like cases of treason may happen in time to come, which cannot be thought of nor declared at present", the court may refer the matter to the King and Parliament, which could then determine the matter by passage of an Act.

After the passage of the Treason Act 1351, several other offences were deemed to comprise high treason by Act of Parliament. Parliament seemed especially unrestrained during the reign of Edward III's successor, [[Richard II of England|Richard II]]. Numerous new offences&amp;mdash;including intending to kill the Sovereign (even without an overt act demonstrating such intent) and killing an ambassador&amp;mdash;were declared treasonable.&lt;ref&gt;[[Treason Act 1397]] (21 Ric.2 c. 12)&lt;/ref&gt; Richard II, however, was deposed; his successor, [[Henry IV of England|Henry IV]], rescinded the legislation and restored the standard of Edward III.

In 1495 [[Poynings' Law]] extended English law to cover Ireland.

From the reign of Henry IV onwards, several new offences were made treasons; most legislation on the subject was passed during the reign of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]. It became high treason to deface money; to escape from prison whilst detained for committing treason, or to aid in an escape of a person detained for treason; to commit [[arson]] to extort money; to refer to the Sovereign offensively in public writing; to counterfeit the Sovereign's [[Royal sign-manual|sign manual]], [[Seal (device)#Signet rings|signet]] or [[Privy Seal|privy seal]]; to refuse to abjure the authority of the [[Pope]]; to marry any of the Sovereign's children, sisters, aunts, nephews or nieces without royal permission; to marry the Sovereign without disclosing prior sexual relationships; attempting to enter into a sexual relationship (out of marriage) with the Queen or a Princess; denying the Sovereign's official styles and titles; and refusing to acknowledge the Sovereign as the Supreme Head of the [[Church of England]]. Some offences, whose complexion was entirely different from traitorous actions, were nevertheless made treasons; thus, it was high treason for a Welshman to steal [[cattle]], to commit murder by poisoning ([[Richard Roose|1531]]), or for an assembly of twelve or more rioters to refuse to disperse when so commanded.

All new forms of high treason introduced since the Treason Act 1351, except those to do with forgery and counterfeiting, were abrogated by the [[Treason Act 1547]], which was passed at the beginning of the reign of [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Treason Act 1547]] (1 Ed. 6, c. 12)&lt;/ref&gt; The Act created new kinds of treason however, including denying that the King was the Supreme Head of the Church, and attempting to interrupt the succession to the throne as determined by the [[Third Succession Act|Act of Succession 1543]].&lt;ref&gt;''ibid.''&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[Mary I of England|Mary I]] became queen in 1553, she passed an Act abolishing all treasons whatsoever which had been created since 1351.&lt;ref&gt;[[Treason Act 1553]] (1 Mar. stat. 1 c. 1)&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, however, the offence of forging the Sovereign's sign manual or signet once again became high treason.&lt;ref&gt;[[Treason Act 1553#Other treason legislation|1 Mar. stat. 2 c. 6]].&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the anti-counterfeiting laws were extended so as to include foreign money deemed legal tender in England. Thus, it became high treason to counterfeit such foreign money, or to import counterfeit foreign money and actually attempt to use it to make a payment. (But importing any counterfeit English money remained high treason, even if no attempt were made to use it in payment.) Mary also made it high treason to kill [[Philip II of Spain]], her [[king consort]], or to try to deprive him of his title.&lt;ref&gt;[[Treason Act 1554]] (1 &amp; 2 Ph. &amp; M. c.10)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William III of England|William III]] made it high treason to manufacture, buy, sell or possess instruments whose sole purpose is to coin money. He also made adding any inscription normally found on a coin to any piece of metal that may resemble a coin high treason. [[George II of Great Britain|George II]] made it high treason to mark or colour a silver coin so as to make it resemble a gold one.

Aside from laws relating to counterfeiting and succession, very few acts concerning the definition of high treason were passed. Under laws passed during the reign of Elizabeth I, it was high treason for an individual to attempt to defend the jurisdiction of the [[Pope]] over the English Church for a third time (a first offence being a misdemeanour and a second offence a felony),&lt;ref&gt;[[Act of Supremacy 1558]]&lt;/ref&gt; or for a Roman Catholic priest to enter the realm and refuse to conform to the English Church,&lt;ref name="Jesuits, etc. Act 1584"/&gt; or to purport to release a subject of his allegiance to the Crown or the Church of England and to reconcile him or her with a foreign power.&lt;ref&gt;[[Religion Act 1580]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles II of England|Charles II's]] [[Sedition Act 1661]] made it treason to imprison, restrain or wound the king. Although this law was abolished in the United Kingdom in 1998, it still continues to apply in some [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries. Under laws passed after [[James II of England|James II]] was deposed, it became treasonable to correspond with the [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] claimants ''([[Correspondence with James the Pretender (High Treason) Act 1701|main article]])'', or to hinder succession to the Throne under the [[Act of Settlement 1701]], or to publish that anyone other than the individual specified by the Act of Settlement had the right to inherit the Crown.&lt;ref&gt;[[Succession to the Crown Act 1707]]; repealed in 1967&lt;/ref&gt;

==History: after union with Scotland==
In 1708, following the [[Acts of Union 1707|Union of England and Scotland]] in the previous year, Queen Anne signed the [[Treason Act 1708]], which harmonised the treason laws of both former kingdoms (effective from July 1709). The English offences of high treason and [[misprision of treason]] (but not petty treason) were extended to Scotland, and the treasonable offences then existing in Scotland were abolished. These were: "theft in Landed Men", murder in breach of trust, fire-raising, "firing coalheughs" and assassination. The Act also made it treason to counterfeit the [[Great Seal of Scotland]], or to slay the [[Senator of the College of Justice|Lords of Session]] or [[Senator of the College of Justice|Lords of Justiciary]] "sitting in Judgment in the Exercise of their Office within Scotland".

In general, treason law in Scotland remained the same as in England, except that when in England the offence of counterfeiting the [[Great Seal of the Realm|Great Seal of the United Kingdom]] ''etc.'' (an offence under other legislation&lt;ref&gt;The [[Forgery Act 1830]] (11 Geo. IV &amp; 1 Gul. IV c. 66), section 2; formerly [[Treason Act 1553#Other treason legislation|1 Mar. stat. 2 c. 6]].&lt;/ref&gt;) was reduced from treason to [[felony]] by the Forgery Act 1861, that Act did not apply to Scotland, and though in England since 1861 it has not been treason to forge the Scottish Great Seal,&lt;ref&gt;The Forgery Act 1830 and the Forgery Act 1861&lt;/ref&gt; in Scotland this remains treason today.&lt;ref&gt;The Treason Act 1708, section 12 (disapplied from England by the Forgery Act 1830, sections 30 and 31).&lt;/ref&gt; When the [[Scottish Parliament]] was set up in 1998, treason and [[Treason Felony Act 1848|treason felony]] were among the "[[Reserved matters (Westminster)|reserved matters]]" it was prohibited from legislating about, ensuring that the law of treason remains uniform throughout Great Britain.

Between 1817 and 1820 it was treason to kill the [[Prince Regent]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Treason Act 1817]]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1832 counterfeiting money ceased to be treason and became a felony.&lt;ref&gt;Coinage Act 1832 (2&amp;3 Will. 4 c. 34), s. 1&lt;/ref&gt; In Ireland, counterfeiting seals ceased to be treason in 1861, in line with England and Wales.&lt;ref&gt;[[Forgery Act 1861]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===First World War===
A notable treason trial occurred at the Old Bailey in 1916 when [[Roger Casement|Sir Roger Casement]] was accused of collusion with Germany for his role in the [[Easter Rising]] in [[Ireland]]. The charge against him was that he tried to encourage Irish soldiers in the British Army to mutiny and fight for [[Germany]]. Casement argued that, as an Irishman, he could not be tried in an English court and should instead be tried in Ireland. This argument failed because he had worked as a [[diplomat]] for the [[Government of the United Kingdom|British Government]] for almost all of his adult life and had accepted a [[knight]]hood and a [[pension]] from the Crown on retirement in 1911. He was hanged in [[Pentonville Prison]] on 3 August 1916, and is now often considered a martyr by the [[Irish Republican]] movement.

The [[Titles Deprivation Act 1917]] authorised the king to deprive [[Hereditary peer|peers]] of their peerage if they had assisted the enemy during the war, or voluntarily resided in enemy territory. This was mainly in response to the closeness of the British royal family with some German thrones, leading to the loss of British titles from the dukes of [[Charles Edward, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha|Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]] and [[Ernest Augustus, Duke of Brunswick|Brunswick]], [[Ernest Augustus, Crown Prince of Hanover|the Crown Prince of Hanover]], and [[Henry Taaffe, 12th Viscount Taaffe|the Viscount Taaffe]]. Whilst the act allowed for their descendants to petition for the restoration of these titles, {{as of|2014|lc=y}} no descendant has done so.

===Second World War===
[[John Amery]] was executed in 1945 after pleading guilty to eight charges of treason for efforts to recruit British prisoners of war into the [[British Free Corps]] and for making [[propaganda]] broadcasts for Nazi Germany.

The last execution for treason in the United Kingdom was held in 1946. [[William Joyce]] (also known as [[Lord Haw Haw]]) stood accused of levying war against King [[George VI of the United Kingdom|George VI]] by travelling to Germany in the early months of [[World War II]] and taking up employment as a broadcaster of pro-Nazi propaganda to British radio audiences. He was awarded a personal commendation by [[Adolf Hitler]] in 1944 for his contribution to the German war effort. On his capture at the end of the war, Parliament rushed through the [[Treason Act 1945]]&lt;ref&gt;1945 c.44&lt;/ref&gt; to facilitate a trial that would have the same procedure as a trial for murder. Before the Act, a trial for treason short of [[regicide]] involved an elaborate and lengthy medieval procedure. Although Joyce was born in the [[United States]] to an [[Irish people|Irish]] father and an English mother, he had moved to Britain in his teens and applied for a British passport in 1933 which was still valid when he defected to Germany and so under the law he owed allegiance to Britain. He appealed against his conviction to the [[House of Lords]] on the grounds he had lied about his country of birth on the passport application and did not owe allegiance to any country at the beginning of the war. The appeal was not upheld and he was executed at [[Wandsworth Prison]] on 3 January 1946.

It is thought the strength of public feeling against Joyce as a perceived traitor was the driving force behind his prosecution. The only evidence offered at his trial that he had begun broadcasting from Germany while his British passport was valid was the testimony of a London police inspector who had questioned him before the war while he was an active member of the [[British Union of Fascists]] and claimed to have recognised his voice on a propaganda broadcast in the early weeks of the war (he already had previous convictions for [[assault]] and riotous assembly as a result of street fights with communists and anarchists).

====Treachery Act 1940====
{{Main|Treachery Act 1940}}
Until 1945 treason had its own rules of evidence and procedure which made it difficult to prosecute accused traitors, such as the need for [[Sedition Act 1661|two witnesses]] to the same offence. Consequently, in the Second World War it was perceived that there was a need for a new offence with which to deal with traitors more expediently. The Treachery Act 1940 was passed creating a [[felony]] called treachery, to punish disloyalty and espionage. It was a capital offence. Seventeen people were sentenced to be shot or hanged for this offence instead of for treason (one death sentence was commuted).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stephen-stratford.co.uk/treachery.htm British Military &amp; Criminal History in the period 1900 to 1999]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Theodore Schurch]] was the last person to be put to death for treachery, in 1946. He was also the last person to be executed for a crime other than murder. [[Josef Jakobs]], a German spy executed for treachery, was the last person to be executed in the [[Tower of London]].

The Treachery Act 1940 was suspended in February 1946, and was repealed in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;[[Criminal Law Act 1967]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===1945 to 2015===
In June 1945 the [[Treason Act 1945]] abolished the special rules of evidence and procedure formerly used in treason trials, and replaced them with the rules applicable to murder trials, to simplify the law. As discussed above, the last treason prosecutions occurred later that year.

From 1945, treason consisted of the offences which are treason today ([[#Offences|see above]]), plus two other kinds. The [[Succession to the Crown Act 1707]] made it treason to affirm that any person has a right to succeed to the Crown otherwise than according to the [[Act of Settlement 1701|Act of Settlement]] and [[Acts of Union 1707|Acts of Union]], or that the Crown and Parliament cannot legislate for the limitation of the succession to the Crown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Treason |volume=27 |page=224 |first=William Feilden |last=Craies}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was abolished in 1967. The [[Treason Act 1795]] made it treason to "compass, imagine, invent, devise or intend death or destruction, or any bodily harm tending to death or destruction, maim or wounding, imprisonment or restraint, of the person of ... the King." This was abolished in 1998, when the death penalty was also abolished.&lt;ref&gt;[[Crime and Disorder Act 1998]], section 36&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 March 2015 the [[Succession to the Crown Act 2013]] came into effect,&lt;ref name=SCA&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2015/894/made Succession to the Crown Act 2013 (Commencement) Order 2015] at legislation.org.uk (retrieved 30 March 2015)&lt;/ref&gt; which amended the line of succession to the throne to give women the same right to succeed to the throne as their brothers. In consequence of this, the Treason Act 1351 was amended in two ways. Whereas it had been treason to encompass the death of the monarch's eldest ''son'' and heir, this was amended to cover an heir of either sex. It had also been treason to "violate" the wife of the monarch's eldest son, but the 2013 Act restricted this to cases where the eldest son is also the heir to the throne.

==Liability==
As a general rule, no British criminal court has jurisdiction over the Sovereign, from whom they derive their authority. As Sir [[William Blackstone]] writes, "the law supposes an incapacity of doing wrong from the excellence and perfection ... of the King." Furthermore, to charge the sovereign with high treason would be inconsistent, as it would constitute accusing him of disloyalty to himself. After the [[English Civil War]], however, [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] was tried for treason against the people of England. His trial and execution were irregular; they were more accurately products of a revolution, rather than a legal precedent{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}, and those responsible were themselves tried for treason after the monarchy was restored ''(see [[List of regicides of Charles I]])''. However, a person who attempts to become the Sovereign without a valid claim can be held guilty of treason. Consequently, [[Lady Jane Grey]] was executed for treason for usurping the throne in 1553.

An alien resident in the United Kingdom owes [[allegiance]] to the Crown, and may be prosecuted for high treason. The only exception is an enemy lawful combatant in wartime, e.g. a uniformed enemy soldier on British territory.

A British subject resident abroad also continues to owe allegiance to the Crown. If he or she becomes a citizen of another state before a war during which he bears arms against the Crown, he or she is not guilty of high treason. On the other hand, becoming a citizen of an enemy state during wartime is high treason, as it constitutes adhering to the sovereign's enemies.

[[Insanity defence|Insane]] individuals are not punished for their crimes. During the reign of Henry VIII, however, [[Treason Act 1541|it was enacted]] that in the cases of high treason, an idiot could be tried in his absence as if he were perfectly sane. In the reign of Mary I, this statute was repealed. Today there are powers to send insane defendants to a mental hospital.&lt;ref&gt;Criminal Procedure (Insanity) Act 1964, s5; Mental Health Act 1983, section 37&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Treason Act 1495]] provides that in a civil war between two claimants to the throne, those who fight for the losing side cannot be held guilty of a crime merely for fighting against the winner.

===Duress and marital coercion===
[[Duress in English law|Duress]] is not available as a defence to treason involving the death of the sovereign.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Archbold Criminal Pleading, Evidence and Practice]]'' (2014) 17-119.&lt;/ref&gt;

In England and Wales and in Northern Ireland, the former defence of [[marital coercion]] was not available to a wife charged with treason.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Criminal Justice Act 1925]] (15 &amp; 16 Geo.5 c.86), section 47&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The [[Criminal Justice Act (Northern Ireland) 1945]] (c.15)(N.I.), section 37&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trial==
Peers and their wives and widows were formerly entitled to be tried for treason and for felonies in the [[House of Lords]] or the [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords#Trials|Court of the Lord High Steward]], the former being used in every case except when Parliament was not in session. In the House of Lords, the Lord High Steward presided, but the entire House acted as both judge and jury. In the Lord High Steward's Court, the Lord High Steward was a judge, and a panel of "Lords Triers" served as a jury. There was no right of [[peremptory challenge]] in either body. Trial by either body ceased in 1948, since which time peers have been tried in the same courts as [[commoner]]s.

Commoners, and now peers and their wives and widows, are entitled to be tried for high treason, and also for lesser crimes, by [[jury]]. Formerly, commoners were entitled to thirty-five peremptory challenges in cases of treason, but only twenty in cases of felony and none in cases of misdemeanours; all peremptory challenges, however, were abolished in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Criminal Justice Act 1988]], [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/33/section/118 section 118]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another mode of trial for treason, and also for other crimes, is in the House of Lords following [[impeachment]] by the House of Commons. Normally, the [[Lord Chancellor]] presided during trials; when a peer is accused of high treason, however, the [[Lord High Steward]] must preside. By convention, however, the Lord Chancellor would be appointed Lord High Steward for the duration of the trial&amp;mdash;the post of Lord High Steward ceased to be regularly filled in 1421, being revived only for trials of peers and for [[coronation]]s. Whilst impeachments are still possible, no impeachment has occurred since 1806.

Finally, it was possible for Parliament to pass an [[bill of attainder|Act of attainder]], which pronounces guilt without a trial. Historically, Acts of attainder have been used against political opponents when speedy executions were desired. In 1661, Parliament passed acts posthumously attainting [[Oliver Cromwell]], [[Henry Ireton]] and [[John Bradshaw (Judge)|John Bradshaw]]&amp;mdash;who were previously involved in Charles I's trial&amp;mdash;of treason. These three individuals were [[posthumous execution|posthumously executed]], and are the only individuals to have suffered this fate posthumously under English treason laws. (In 1540, a Scottish court summoned Robert Leslie, who was deceased, for a trial for treason. The [[Parliament of Scotland|Estates-General]] declared the summons lawful; Leslie's body was exhumed, and his bones were presented at the bar of the court. This procedure was never used in England.)

==Procedure and evidence==

===Before 1945===
Certain special rules procedures have historically applied to high treason cases. The [[Privilege of peerage|privilege of the peerage]] and [[parliamentary privilege]] preclude the arrest of certain individuals (including peers, wives and widows of peers and members of [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]]) in many cases, but treason was not included (nor were felony or breach of the peace). Similarly, an individual could not claim [[sanctuary]] when charged with high treason; this distinction between treasons and felonies was lost as sanctuary laws were repealed in the late 17th and early 19th century. The defendant, furthermore, could not claim the [[benefit of clergy]] in treason cases; but the benefit of the clergy, as well, was abolished during the 19th century.

Formerly, if an individual stood mute and refused to plead guilty or not guilty for a felony, he would be tortured until he enter a plea; if he died in the course of the torture, his lands would not be seized to the Crown, and his heirs would be allowed to succeed to them. In cases of high treason, however, an individual could not save his lands by refusing to enter a plea; instead, a refusal would be punished by immediate forfeiture of all estates. This distinction between treasons and felonies ended in 1772, when the court was permitted to enter a plea on a defendant's behalf.

Formerly, an individual was not entitled to assistance of counsel in any capital case, including treason; the rule, however, was abolished in treason cases by the [[Treason Act 1695]]. The same Act extended a rule [[Sedition Act 1661|from 1661]] which had made it necessary to produce at least two witnesses to prove each alleged offence of high treason. Nearly one hundred years later a stricter version of this rule was incorporated into the [[Constitution of the United States]]. The 1695 Act also provided for a three-year time limit on bringing prosecutions for treason (except for assassinating the king) and [[misprision of treason]], another rule which has been imitated in some common law countries.

These rules made it difficult to prosecute charges of treason, and the rule was relaxed by the [[Treason Act 1800]] to make attempts on the life of the King subject to the same rules of procedure and evidence as existed in murder trials (which did not require two witnesses). This change was extended to all assaults on the Sovereign by the [[Treason Act 1842]]. Finally the special rules for treason were abolished by the [[Treason Act 1945]] when the rules of evidence and procedure in all cases of treason were made the same as for murder. However, the original three-year time limit stated above survived into the present day. This meant that when [[James Hewitt]] was accused of treason in 1996 because of his affair with the Princess of Wales,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-61323395.html Excerpt from The Mirror, 2 March 1996, at Highbeam.com] (retrieved 12 December 2014).&lt;/ref&gt; he could not be prosecuted because it could not be proved that he had done it within the foregoing three-year period.

===Modern procedure===
The procedure on trials for treason is the same as that on trials for murder.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Criminal Law Act 1967]] (c.58), section 12(6)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The [[Criminal Law Act (Northern Ireland) 1967]] (c.18) (N.I.), section 14(7)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The [[Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995]] (c.46), section 289&lt;/ref&gt; It is therefore an [[indictable-only offence]].

===Alternative verdict===
'''England and Wales'''
On the trial of an indictment for treason, the jury cannot return an [[alternative verdict]] to the offence charged in that indictment under section 6(3) of the [[Criminal Law Act 1967]]. For example, the jury cannot give an alternative verdict of [[manslaughter]] in cases of the assassination of the monarch. The [[Homicide Act 1957]] does not apply. However, under the common law the jury may return a verdict of guilty of [[misprision of treason]] instead of treason.

'''Northern Ireland'''
On the trial of an indictment for treason, the jury cannot return an alternative verdict to the offence charged in that indictment under section 6(2) of the [[Criminal Law Act (Northern Ireland) 1967]]. For this purpose each count is considered to be a separate indictment (s.6(7)).

===Limitation===
A person may not be indicted for treason committed within the United Kingdom (subject to the following exception) unless the indictment is preferred within three years of the commission of that offence.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Treason Act 1695]] (7 &amp; 8 Will.3 c.3), section 5; as amended by the [[Administration of Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1933]] (23 &amp; 24 Geo.5 c.86), section 2(8) and paragraph 1 of Schedule 2. The 1933 Act was in turn amended by the [[Coroners and Justice Act 2009]], [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2009/25/section/116 section 116], which abolished the requirement that indictments be signed.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The [[Treason Act 1708]] (7.Ann. c.21), section 1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The [[Treason (Ireland) Act 1821]] (1 &amp; 2 Geo.4 c.24)&lt;/ref&gt; This limitation does not apply to treason which consists of designing, endeavouring or attempting to assassinate the sovereign.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Treason Act 1695]] (7 &amp; 8 Will.3 c.3), section 6&lt;/ref&gt; There is no time limit on the prosecution of treason committed outside of the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;The Law Commission (1977). Treason, Sedition and Allied Offences (Working Paper No.72), paragraph 36&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bail===
In England and Wales, a person charged with treason may not be granted [[bail]] except by order of a [[High Court judge (England and Wales)|High Court judge]] or of the [[Secretary of State (United Kingdom)|Secretary of State]].&lt;ref&gt;The [[Magistrates' Courts Act 1980]] (c.43), section 41 and the [[Bail Act 1976]] (c.63), section 4(7)&lt;/ref&gt; The same rule applies in Northern Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;The Magistrates' Courts Order (Northern Ireland) 1981 (No.1675 (N.I.26)), article 38&lt;/ref&gt;

In Scotland, all crimes and offences which are treason are bailable.&lt;ref&gt;The Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995 (c.46), section 24(1); as amended by the Bail, Judicial Appointments etc. (Scotland) Act 2000 (asp 9), section 3(1)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Punishment==

===Before 1998===
The form of execution once suffered by traitors was often (though not invariably) [[torture|torturous]]. The condemned could not walk or be carried to the place of execution; the sentence required that they were to be drawn: they might be dragged along the ground, but were normally tied onto a hurdle which was drawn to the place of execution by a horse. A man would then be [[hanging|hanged]] by a noose around the neck, but not so as to die: there would be no "drop" to break the neck. Whilst still alive, he would be cut down and allowed to drop to the ground, stripped of his clothes, his [[genitalia|genitals]] cut off, his [[viscera]] pulled out and burnt before his own eyes, and other organs would be torn out of his body. The body would be decapitated, and cut into four quarters. The body parts would be at the disposal of the Sovereign, and generally they would be [[gibbet]]ed or publicly displayed as a warning. The body parts would be parboiled in salt and [[cumin]] seed: the salt to prevent putrefaction, and the cumin seed to prevent birds pecking at the flesh.&lt;ref&gt;Kenny, C. ''Outlines of Criminal Law'' (Cambridge University Press, 1936), 15th edition, p. 318&lt;/ref&gt; This sentence was amended [[Treason Act 1814|in 1814]] so that the offender would hang to death; the disembowelling, beheading and quartering were to be carried out posthumously.

Women were excluded from this type of punishment and instead were drawn and then [[Burning of women in England|burned at the stake]], until this was replaced with hanging by the [[Treason Act 1790]] and the [[Treason by Women Act (Ireland) 1796]].

The penalty for high treason by counterfeiting or clipping coins was the same as the penalty for [[petty treason]] (which for men was drawing and hanging without the torture and quartering, and for women was burning or hanging.)&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=2KoDAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PR11&amp;dq=subject:%22Pleas+of+the+crown%22+volume+one&amp;lr=#PRA2-PA376,M1 Hale's ''History of Pleas of the Crown'' (1800 ed.) vol. 1, pages 219-220] (from [[Google Book Search|Google Books]]).&lt;/ref&gt;

Individuals of noble birth were not subjected to either form of torture, but merely beheaded. Even commoners' sentences were sometimes commuted to beheading—a sentence not formally removed from the British law until 1973.&lt;ref&gt;Treason Act 1814 section 2, repealed by Statute Law (Repeals) Act 1973 (c. 39), Sch. 1 Pt. V.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to being tortured and executed, a traitor was also deemed "[[attainted]]". The first consequence of attainder was forfeiture; all lands and estates of a traitor were forever forfeit to the Crown. A second consequence was corruption of blood; the attainted person could neither inherit property, nor transmit it to his or her descendants. This may have been open to abuse, either by avaricious monarchs or by parliament when little (if any) evidence was available to secure a conviction. There was a complex and ceremonial procedure used to try treason cases, with a strict requirement for a minimum of two witnesses to the crime.

In 1832 the death penalty was abolished for treason by forging seals and the Royal sign manual.&lt;ref&gt;[[Forgery, Abolition of Punishment of Death Act 1832]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1870, attainder was abolished. In the same year in England,&lt;ref&gt;[[Forfeiture Act 1870]], s. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1949 in Scotland,&lt;ref&gt;Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act 1949, s. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; posthumous drawing and quartering was abolished, and so the sole punishment was hanging.

Beheading was abolished in 1973,&lt;ref&gt;Statute Law (Repeals) Act 1973, Schedule 1, Part V.&lt;/ref&gt; by which time it had long been obsolete.

By 1965, capital punishment had been abolished for almost all crimes, but was still mandatory (unless the offender was pardoned or the sentence commuted) for high treason until 1998. By section 36 of the [[Crime and Disorder Act 1998]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/37/section/36 Section 36, from The National Archives]&lt;/ref&gt; the maximum punishment for high treason became life imprisonment. ''(See also [[Treason Act 1814]].)''

The last beheading of a peer for high treason was that of [[Simon Fraser, 11th Lord Lovat]] in 1747. The last execution by [[Burning of women in England|burning]] for high treason was that of [[Catherine Murphy (counterfeiter)|Catherine Murphy]] in 1789. The last sentences of hanging, drawing and quarterings were those on the [[Cato Street Conspiracy|Cato Street Conspirators]] in 1820, (but the drawing and quartering were omitted by royal command). One of the last executions for high treason was that of [[John Amery]], the last person in the United Kingdom to plead guilty to high treason. The last execution of any kind for high treason was that of [[William Joyce]] by hanging in 1946.

A person convicted of treason is liable to imprisonment for life or for any shorter term.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Treason Act (Ireland) 1537]], section I (amended by the [[Crime and Disorder Act 1998]], section 36(1)); the [[Crown of Ireland Act 1542]], section II (amended by the 1998 Act, section 36(2)(a)); the [[Act of Supremacy (Ireland)]] (1560), section XII (amended by the 1998 Act, section 36(2)(b)); the [[Treason Act 1702]], section 3 (amended by the 1998 Act, section 36(2)(c)); the [[Treason Act (Ireland) 1703]], section I (amended by the 1998 Act, section 36(2)(d)); the [[Treason Act 1708]], section V; and the [[Treason Act 1814]], section 1 (amended by the 1998 Act, section 36(4))&lt;/ref&gt; A [[whole life tariff]] may be imposed for the gravest offences.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/6/section/82A Powers of Criminal Courts (Sentencing) Act 2000, section 82A]&lt;/ref&gt; (See [[Life imprisonment (England and Wales)|Life imprisonment in England and Wales]] for more details).

Treason also entails disqualification from public office, and loss of [[suffrage]]&lt;ref&gt;Forfeiture Act 1870, section 2.&lt;/ref&gt; (except in local elections).&lt;ref&gt;Local Government Act 1933, Sch. 10, Sch. 11 Pt. IV; London Government Act 1939, Sch. 8; Local Government (Members and Officers) Act (Northern Ireland) 1964, Schedule.&lt;/ref&gt; This rule does not apply in Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;Forfeiture Act 1870, section 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scottish Parliament and Northern Ireland Assembly==
Treason (including [[constructive treason]]) is a [[Reserved matters (Westminster)|reserved matter]] on which the [[Scottish Parliament]] cannot legislate.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Scotland Act 1998]] (c.46), section 29(1) and (2)(b) and paragraph 10 of Part I of Schedule 5&lt;/ref&gt;

Treason (but not powers of arrest or criminal procedure) is an excepted matter on which the [[Northern Ireland Assembly]] cannot legislate.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Northern Ireland Act 1998]] (c.47), sections 4(1) and 6(2)(b) and paragraph 7 of Schedule 2&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treason today==
Almost all treason-related offences introduced since the Treason Act 1351 was passed have been abolished or relegated to lesser offences. The Treason Act 1351, on the other hand, has not been significantly amended; the only changes involve the removal of [[counterfeit]]ing, as explained above. For the state of the law today, see the ''Offences'' section above.

In Autumn 2001 following [[9/11]], the British government threatened British citizens who fought for the [[Taliban]] army in [[Afghanistan]] against Anglo-American troops with prosecution for treason, although no one was subsequently tried, at least not for treason.

On 8 August 2005, it was reported that the UK Government was considering bringing prosecutions for treason against a number of British Islamic clerics who have publicly spoken positively about acts of terrorism against civilians in Britain, or attacks on British soldiers abroad, including the [[7 July London bombings]] and numerous attacks on troops serving in [[Iraq]] and [[Afghanistan]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4130454.stm BBC News: "Terror treason charge considered,"] 8 August 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Following this threat one foreign cleric who the British government had failed to deport fled to Lebanon, only to request to be rescued by the British military during the [[2006 Israeli-Lebanon War]]. However, later that year prosecutors indicted [[Abu Hamza al-Masri]] for inciting murder (he was convicted in February 2006), and it now seems unlikely that anyone will be charged with treason in the foreseeable future.

In 2008 the former attorney-general, [[Lord Goldsmith]] QC, published a report on his review of [[British nationality law|British citizenship]]. One of his recommendations was for a "thorough reform and rationalisation of the law" of treason.&lt;ref&gt;[http://image.guardian.co.uk/sys-files/Politics/documents/2008/03/11/citizenship-report-full.pdf "Citizenship: Our Common Bond"], p. 81, at The Guardian website (retrieved 23 April 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 the [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] [[Philip Hammond]] revealed that the British Government was considering high treason charges for [[Islamic extremism|Islamic extremists]] in response to [[Foreign rebel fighters in the Syrian Civil War#United Kingdom|growing numbers of British Jihad fighters travelling]] to [[Syria]] and [[Iraq]] to join the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Groves|first1=Jason|title=British terrorists fighting for ISIS in Iraq and Syria could be tried for 'high treason' reveals Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2795771/british-terrorists-fighting-isis-iraq-syria-tried-high-treason-reveals-foreign-secretary-philip-hammond.html|accessdate=16 February 2015|publisher=Daily Mail|date=16 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Treason charge idea considered for UK jihadists|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-29655099|accessdate=16 February 2015|agency=BBC News|publisher=BBC (British Broadcasting Corporation)|date=17 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14624">The '''Joint Committee on the National Security Strategy''' (JCNSS) was created to "monitor the implementation and development" of the [[United Kingdom]] Government's [[National Security Strategy (United Kingdom)|National Security Strategy]]".&lt;ref name="homepage"&gt;[http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-archive/jcnss/ Committee Home Page (archive)]&lt;/ref&gt; It was first established in the 2005-2010 Parliament, and was reappointed in December 2010 and December 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmstords/539/539.pdf Standing Orders of the House of Commons for Public Business (April 2010) §152I]&lt;/ref&gt; The committee comprises members from the [[House of Commons (United Kingdom)|House of Commons]] and members of the [[House of Lords]].

==Role==
[[Image:Margaret Beckett May 2007.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Margaret Beckett]] has been Chair of the JCNSS since 2010]]
The committee’s terms of reference are “to consider the National Security Strategy”.&lt;ref&gt;Standing Orders of the House of Commons Public Business 2011, SO No 152I and HL Deb, 6 December 2010, Col 10.&lt;/ref&gt;  It has said that it does not wish to duplicate the work of other [[Select committee (United Kingdom)|select committees]], and instead intends to draw on their work.&lt;ref&gt;Joint Committee on the National Security Strategy: First review of the National Security Strategy 2010, First Report of Session 2010–12.&lt;/ref&gt; The Committee "scrutinises the structures for Government decision-making on National Security, particularly the role of the [[National Security Council (United Kingdom)|National Security Council]] and the National Security Adviser."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/joint-select/national-security-strategy/role/&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''First Review of the National Security Strategy 2010'' ==
The committee published its first report ''First Review of the National Security Strategy 2010'' on 8 March 2012. The report addresses the National Security Strategy, the National Security Council (and the secretariat which supports it), and the National Security Adviser. It was agreed unanimously.&lt;ref&gt;Joint Committee on the National Security Strategy First review of the National Security Strategy 2010 First Report of Session 2010–12 p43&lt;/ref&gt; The committee welcomed the National Security Strategy but said  that it was work in progress and needed to be improved.&lt;ref&gt;Joint Committee on the National Security Strategy First review of the National Security Strategy 2010 First Report of Session 2010–12 p3&lt;/ref&gt; In a press release sent out with the report it said that:

*There is no evidence that the NSS has influenced decisions made since the [[Strategic Defence and Security Review 2010|Strategic Defence and Security Review]]. If the current strategy is not guiding choices then it needs to be revised.
*There should be an "overarching strategy", a document designed to guide government decision-making and crisis management both at home and on the international stage.
*The government’s assertion that there will be no reduction in the UK's influence on the world stage is "wholly unrealistic in the medium to long term" and the UK needs to plan for a changing, and more partnership-dependent, role in the world.&lt;ref name="report1"&gt;http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/joint-select/national-security-strategy/news/publication-of-report1/&lt;/ref&gt;

It also said that the government's unwillingness to provide it with all the information it had asked for about the National Security Risk Assessment means that it was unable to give Parliament any assurances about its adequacy.&lt;ref name="report1"/&gt; The committee expressed concerns that the "National Security Council's oversight of security issues is not sufficiently broad and strategic", given that it was deeply involved in operations in Libya and failed to discuss the national security implications of the Eurozone crisis or the possibility of Scottish independence.&lt;ref name="report1"/&gt;

==Government response and the committee's second report==

The JCNSS published the government response to its first report on 11 July 2012, along with a two-page report summarising the committee's concerns about the response.&lt;ref&gt;Planning for the next National Security Strategy: comments on the government response to the committee's First Report of Session 2010-12&lt;/ref&gt; The committee said that it welcomed the government response and the government's commitment to providing it with more information in future, but said that the government had failed to:

*to respond adequately to the committee's concerns about the implications of recent US strategy documents, the potential impact of Scottish independence, and the consequences of the Eurozone crisis
*to take the opportunity to look at how it could do things differently
*to press ahead with planning for the next National Security Strategy (NSS).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/joint-select/national-security-strategy/news/first-report-2012-13/&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The committee said that the government needed to start to map out its programme for the next NSS immediately.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/joint-select/national-security-strategy/news/first-report-2012-13/&lt;/ref&gt;  It also called on the Government to supply it with an indicative programme for producing and consulting on the next NSS.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/joint-select/national-security-strategy/news/first-report-2012-13/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Government response to the committee’s second report==

The government responded in November 2012 and said that it was:

“now starting to consider the scope, conceptual structure, process, timing, and possible forms of external (including international) engagement required to ensure that the 2015 NSS and SDSR will meet UK national security needs.”

It said that “the Cabinet Office is leading initial preparatory work” on the NSS but did not give an “indicative programme” or set out the planned staffing, resources or public consultation as the committee had requested. It undertook to consult the JCNSS in confidence as the forward work programme took shape and to keep the Committee up-to-date on significant developments.

The JCNSS published this response as its First Special Report of Session 2012-13.

==The work of the Joint Committee on the National Security Strategy in 2012==

In February 2013 the committee published its report ''The work of the Joint Committee on the National Security Strategy in 2012''. This reviewed the committee’s work over the past year and called on the government to address five key areas of concern:

*The NSC appears to have focused on operational matters and short-term imperatives, rather than long-term strategy.
*The committee is not convinced that the NSC is making the contribution it should and questions how much extra value is derived from having the NSC as opposed to the preceding systems of Cabinet committees.
*Major strategic policy changes appear to have been made by individual government departments without discussion at the NSC: most notably, the big policy decisions made by the MoD last year in Future Reserves and Army 2020.
*The NSC appears to have neglected, or only recently discussed, some very central questions: the strategic and security impact of the Eurozone crisis and of efforts to save the Euro; the planned referendums on Scottish independence and EU membership; and the significance of the US pivot to Asia-Pacific.  
*The Committee has not yet seen evidence of the government pressing ahead with planning for the next NSS or giving serious consideration to engaging outside experts, politicians across the political parties and the public in its development.

In a press release the chair of the committee said that “the NSC should think strategically, keeping its eye on the longer term and assessing the effect of Departments’ policy proposals. We were stunned that the NSC had not discussed the implications of the major policy changes made last year by the MOD. How it can be strategic if it has not considered the impact of restructuring the Army?”

==Conflict, Stability and Security Fund Report 2017==

The Committee published its [https://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/jt201617/jtselect/jtnatsec/208/208.pdf report] into the [[Conflict, Stability and Security Fund]] (CSSF) in January 2017 after an eight-month inquiry.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/joint-select/national-security-strategy/inquiries/parliament-2015/conflict-stability-security-fund-16-17/&lt;/ref&gt; The report praised many of the intentions of the CSSF, but criticised its lack of transparency for the purposes of Parliamentary scrutiny.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2017/feb/07/secrecy-around-1bn-aid-and-security-fund-raises-significant-concern-say-mps&lt;/ref&gt; The Committee also noted that the CSSF would be better managed under the control of a single Government Minister, fearing that "collective responsibility will degenerate into no responsibility."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Conflict, Stability and Security Fund|year=2017|publisher=JCNSS|location=London|url=https://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/jt201617/jtselect/jtnatsec/208/208.pdf|accessdate=15 February 2017|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cyber Security Inquiry==

The JCNSS announced its Cyber Security Inquiry in January 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Cyber Security: UK National Security in a Digital World inquiry | url=http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/joint-select/national-security-strategy/inquiries/parliament-2015/cyber-security-inquiry-16-17/ | accessdate=2 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A century ago, in ''[[Johannesburg Consolidated Investment Co v Johannesburg Town Council]]'', Innes CJ distinguished only three types'''Bold text''' of '''judicial review in the South African system''':

# review of the decisions of inferior '''courts;'''
# the common-law review of decisions of administrative authorities; and
# a "wider" form of statutory review.

These three forms of review still exist today, but the list has been expanded as a result of modern developments, including and most especially the Constitution. Among the latest additions are

* automatic review, which allows the decisions of inferior courts to be reconsidered in the absence of an application for review;
* constitutional review, a form of review that did not exist in South Africa before 1994, but which the existence of a supreme constitution with a justiciable Bill of Rights permits; and
* what used to be common-law review in administrative law but has now largely been constitutionalised by section 33 of the Constitution and placed on a statutory footing by the Promotion of Administrative Justice Act (PAJA).

== Forms of judicial review ==

=== Review of the proceedings of inferior courts ===
The High Courts may be asked to review the proceedings of inferior courts, such as magistrates’ courts and small claims courts, on grounds set out in section 24 of the Supreme Court Act.&lt;ref&gt;Act 59 of 1959.&lt;/ref&gt; The grounds are absence of jurisdiction, bias or corruption on the part of the presiding officer, gross irregularity in the proceedings, and the admission of inadmissible evidence.

=== Automatic review ===
Certain statutes make provision for the decisions of magistrates or other judicial officers to be reviewed "automatically" by judges, meaning that the review is not initiated by an aggrieved individual but takes place by virtue of a statutory trigger. Probably the best-known example is section 302 of the Criminal Procedure Act,&lt;ref&gt;Act 51 of 1977.&lt;/ref&gt; which provides for the automatic review by judges of certain sentences imposed by magistrates. Another example is section 19(3) of the Extension of Security of Tenure Act,&lt;ref&gt;Act 62 of 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; which provides for the automatic review of orders of eviction granted in the magistrates’ courts.

=== Judicial review in the constitutional sense ===
In constitutional law "judicial review" usually means the power of the courts to scrutinise and declare unconstitutional any type of legislation, original or delegated, or state conduct that infringes on rights in the Bill of Rights (such as the right to equality or the right to privacy) or otherwise offends against provisions of the Constitution. As a result of the constitutionalisation of administrative law, review in the administrative-law sense is now largely a species of constitutional review.

=== Judicial review in the administrative-law sense ===
In administrative law "judicial review" refers more specifically to the power of the courts to scrutinise and set aside administrative decisions or rules (delegated legislation) on the basis of certain grounds of review. In the pre-democratic era this was an inherent power of the Supreme Court and was governed by the common law. Today this type of review is regulated indirectly by section 33 of the Constitution and directly by PAJA. Thus judicial review in the administrative-law sense is now principally a statutory matter. When PAJA is not of application for whatever reason, this type of review will be governed either by other principles of the Constitution, chiefly section 1(c) (where public powers are concerned) or by the common law in the case of private powers.The point of providing for review was to make it more accessible.

=== Special statutory review ===
The legislature may and often does confer on the courts a statutory power of review. This is "special" because it differs from "ordinary" judicial review in the administrative-law sense (as now governed by PAJA). It is sometimes a wider power than ordinary review, and thus more akin to an appeal, but it may well be narrower, with the court confined to particular grounds of review or particular remedies. While Innes CJ spoke of the statutory review power as being "far wider" than the first two kinds of review mentioned by him, "it is clear that the precise extent of the power always depends on the particular statutory provision concerned."&lt;ref&gt;Hoexter ''Administrative Law'' 113.&lt;/ref&gt; This was recognised by Van Heerden JA for a unanimous Supreme Court of Appeal in ''[[Nel NO v The Master]]''.

The statute book is replete with examples of special statutory review. One example is the review of decisions made in terms of the Promotion of Access to Information Act&lt;ref&gt;Act 2 of 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; (PAIA), which takes place on grounds to be gleaned from that statute. Others are the review of a "decision, ruling, order or taxation" of the Master in terms of section 151 of the Insolvency Act&lt;ref&gt;Act 24 of 1936.&lt;/ref&gt; and the provision in section 145 of the Labour Relations Act&lt;ref&gt;Act 66 of 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; for review of arbitration awards made by the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA). The review of private (consensual) arbitration takes place in terms of section 33(1) of the Arbitration Act&lt;ref&gt;Act 42 of 1965.&lt;/ref&gt; on grounds that overlap somewhat with those applying to the proceedings of inferior courts.

== Administrative law ==
The first two types of review listed above are not of much relevance to administrative law, although there is some overlap between the grounds for reviewing the decisions of inferior courts and the grounds for reviewing the decisions of administrators. For the most part, the term "judicial review"—when used in the context of administrative law, and when used without qualification—means the review of administrative decisions and delegated legislation. Special statutory review is also a concern of administrative law, as it generally operates as an alternative or potential alternative to the review of administrative decisions and delegated legislation under the PAJA.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3982">'''The Ministry of Justice of Bosnia and Herzegovina''' (abbreviated to '''MPR''') is one of ten ministries within the Council of Ministers of Bosnia and Herzegovina that is responsible for the country's judiciary body. The headquarters of the Ministry of Justice of Bosnia and Herzegovina is located in a building resulting from the partnership between Greece and Bosnia and Herzegovina on the Square of Bosnia and Herzegovina in Sarajevo.

Following the independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1992, the Ministry of Justice of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina began to operate from the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (SFRY) at the level of the newly established Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. After the end of the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and the signing of the 1995 Dayton Peace Agreement, the Ministry of Justice of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Ministry of Justice of the RS started functioning for the judiciary in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

By 2008, the Ministry of Justice of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Ministry of Justice of Republika Srpska were responsible for the jurisdiction of the judiciary in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Following the general elections in Bosnia and Herzegovina in 2006 and the formation of a new government in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Justice Ministry of Bosnia and Herzegovina began functioning for the judiciary in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

The Ministry of Justice has the authority to administer these judicial institutions at the level of Bosnia and Herzegovina:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mpr.gov.ba/ministarstvo/nadleznosti/Default.aspx?id=68&amp;langTag=bs-BA|title=Nadležnosti|website=www.mpr.gov.ba|access-date=2018-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Oleg Vladimirovich Naumov''' ({{lang-ru|link=no|Оле́г Влади́мирович Нау́мов}}; born 1978) is a Russian [[mass murderer]], convicted for the killing of seven people on 26 January 1998, in [[Sakhalin Oblast]].

== Background ==
Oleg Naumov was born in 1978, and was serving as a [[Private (rank)|private]] in the [[Russian Ground Forces]], having been [[conscripted]] into the military a year before the attack. He was stationed at a military base located in Pobedino, a village on the island of [[Sakhalin]] in the [[Russian Far East]] region. Naumov had a [[criminal record]] and a history of [[drug abuse]] from as early as 13-years-old, which was unknown to his commanders at the time.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1998/jan/28/news/mn-13015|title=Russia Soldier Runs Amok, Kills 7 at Remote Base|first=CAROL J.|last=WILLIAMS|date=28 January 1998|publisher=|via=LA Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Attack ==
On 26 January 1998, while serving on guard duty, Naumov attacked another soldier at random with an [[axe]] before grabbing his [[automatic rifle]], when he then shot dead another soldier on guard duty and his commander, before shooting eight more soldiers in the base cafeteria and in a restroom, killing five of them.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

== Arrest and conviction ==
Naumov fled the base but was detained a few hours later while hiding in a nearby village, and was hospitalized where he was put under heavy [[sedation]]. During his interrogation about the crimes at the base, Naumov claimed that he had been high off of [[acetone]] vapors, and did not recollect committing the killings.

Private Naumov was sentenced by the Far Eastern Military District Court to [[life imprisonment]] in a maximum-security [[penal colony]].

It has 31 floors, which will mainly consist of typical office space with some retail space.

==Location==
One World Place is located along 32nd Avenue, close to the [[Bonifacio High Street]], [[EcoTower]] and a few blocks away from main thoroughfares [[EDSA (road)|EDSA]] and [[C-5 Road|C-5]].

==Design and Features==
With an architectural height of 122 m, One World Place is the 7th tallest building in Bonifacio Global City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=One World Place|url=http://www.emporis.com/buildings/1198060/one-world-place-taguig-philippines|website=http://www.emporis.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently a LEED-registered building, One World Place includes eco-friendly and high-performance features fit for a LEED Silver rating. It has a rainwater collection and graywater system to manage water consumption as well as daylighting, efficient insulated glass, and solar-reflective coating to lower electricity costs for tenants. It also has an earthquake-resistant design that lessens building impact in case the city gets hit by an earthquake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=One World Place: Award-Winning Office Building in BGC|url=http://kmcmaggroup.com/blog/2014/1/10/one-world-place-award-winning-office-building-in-bgc/|website=http://kmcmaggroup.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One World Place's unique design innovation is the integration of 'monsoon windows' into the curtain wall facade. During rainy season, these windows allow outside air into the building to make the cooling system more efficient and ensure that all public spaces receive natural ventilation. According to [[Gensler]], One World Place is the first commercial building in Southeast Asia to feature this concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Xeljic|first1=Alexander Sasha|title=Project Spotlight: One World Place|url=http://www.gensleron.com/work/2014/12/3/project-spotlight-one-world-place.html|website=http://www.gensleron.com/|accessdate=10 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction updates==
The building is currently in the final phase of construction and is set to open its doors in 2016.

The '''Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990''' is an [[Act of Parliament]] of the [[United Kingdom]] that altered the laws on granting of planning permission for building works, notably including those of the [[listed building]] system in England and Wales.

==Secondary Legislation==
 
[[The Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) (Amendment No. 2) (England) Regulations 2009]] were made on 6 October 2009 and came into force on 2 November 2009.  They amend [[The Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) (England) Regulations 1990]] as amended (‘the 1990 Regulations’), by substituting Schedule 4 of the 1990 Regulations (notices that a building has become listed or that a building has ceased to be listed), to reflect the fact that [[Historic England]] now compiles lists of [[buildings of special architectural or historic interest]] and the Secretary of State (SoS) is responsible for approving them.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2226">A '''primary authority''' is a term used in legal research to refer to statements of law that are binding upon the courts, government, and individuals. Primary authority is usually in the form of a [[document]] that establishes the [[law]], and if no document exists, is a legal opinion of a court. The search for applicable primary authority is the most important part of the process of [[legal research]]. 

Examples of primary authority include the verbatim texts of:

*[[Constitutions]];
*[[Basic law]]s;
*[[Statute]]s (whether codified or uncodified);
*[[Treaties]] and certain other [[international law]] materials;
*[[Municipal charter]]s and [[local ordinance|ordinances]];
*[[legal opinion|Court opinions]];&lt;ref&gt;Although the texts of court opinions are primary authority, care should be taken when analyzing the texts to determine which parts are binding as holdings in the case (see [[Stare decisis]], [[Precedent]] and [[Ratio decidendi]]), and which parts are non-binding (see [[Obiter dictum]]).&lt;/ref&gt;
*Rules of court [[civil procedure|procedure]];
*[[Rules of evidence]];
*Rules governing the conduct of [[lawyers]];
*[[government agency|Administrative]] [[regulations]];
*[[Executive order (United States)|Executive orders]].

Verbatim re-prints by private commercial law publishing companies are also considered primary authority, as long as the document purports to be '''and actually is''' a '''verbatim''' re-print of the applicable document, statute, regulation, court opinion, etc. Many lawyers, legal scholars, government agencies and others use verbatim re-prints of texts published by private publishing companies.

The term 'primary authority' is used to distinguish primary authority materials from texts considered to be [[Secondary authority]].

Primary Authority can also refer to the scheme, created by the British Government, to give businesses tailored advice on regulatory matters.[https://www.gov.uk/guidance/local-regulation-primary-authority]

{{Property law}}

'''Prior appropriation [[water rights]]''' is the legal doctrine that the first person to take a quantity of water from a water source for "beneficial use" (agricultural, industrial or household) has the right to continue to use that quantity of water for that purpose.

Subsequent users can take the remaining water for their own beneficial use if they do not impinge on the rights of previous users.

The doctrine developed in the [[Western United States]] and is different from [[riparian water rights]], which are applied in the rest of the [[United States]]. Water is very scarce in the West and so must be allocated sparingly, based on the productivity of its use. The right is also allotted to those who are "first in time of use."

==Origin of the doctrine==
The appropriation doctrine originated in California around the time of the Gold Rush where miners were looking for ways to increase the amount of water available for mining operations. The 1855 [[California Supreme Court]] case of ''Irwin v. Phillips'' is what brought the water appropriation problems to light. Matthew Irwin diverted a stream for his mining operation. Shortly afterward, Robert Phillips started a mining operation downstream and eventually tried to divert the water back to its original streambed. The case was taken all the way to the California Supreme Court, which ruled in favor of the appropriation law.

==Details==
"Each drop of rain falling through the sky has already been allocated to a user.  Leave the hose running between rinses while you wash your car and you won't run afoul of the law; but if you gather a pailful of rainwater and pour on your tomato plant, look over your shoulder for a water cop.  You will be preventing those raindrops from entering the watershed, depriving people downstream from the surrounding creeks and rivers of their rights to use their apportioned amounts of streamflow.  The doctrine of prior appropriation comes crashing up against the imperative to conserve scarce water.  Colorado made it legal for some homeowners to harvest rain and snow from their roofs.  Tucson is encouraging its citizens to gather rainwater.  Santa Fe made catchment devices mandatory for new dwellings.  But, in Utah and Washington (with the exception of Seattle), harvesting raindrops is still a crime."&lt;ref&gt;Grace, S. Dam Nation, 2012, PP 224.&lt;/ref&gt;

The legal details vary from state to state; however, the general principle is that water rights are unconnected to land ownership, and can be sold or mortgaged like other property. These rights can be lost over time if non-use of the water source is demonstrated or if the water has not been used for a certain number of years.&lt;ref name="undeerc.org"&gt;[http://www.undeerc.org/Water/Decision-Support/Water-Law/pdf/Water-Appr-Systems.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

There are four essential elements: intent, diversion, beneficial use, and priority. The first person to use a quantity of water from a water source for a [[beneficial use]] has the right to continue to use that quantity of water for that purpose.  Subsequent users can use the remaining water for their own beneficial purposes provided that they do not impinge on the rights of previous users; this is the priority element of the doctrine. In addition to this, a user may not change the intent in which he is appropriating water such that the change hinders the use by another.&lt;ref name="undeerc.org" /&gt;  These ''Preservation of Conditions'' were granted to the second user after ''Farmers High Line v. City of Golden'' (CO 1954).

Beneficial use is commonly defined as [[agriculture|agricultural]], [[industry|industrial]] or [[household]] use. [[Ecology|Ecological]] purposes, such as maintaining a natural body of water and the wildlife that depends on it, were not initially deemed as beneficial uses in some Western states but have been accepted in some jurisdictions.  The extent to which private parties may own such rights varies among the states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Western States Instream Flow Summary |publisher=National Science &amp; Technology Center |url=http://www.blm.gov/nstc/WaterLaws/stateflowsummary.html |accessdate=2007-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each water right has a yearly quantity and an appropriation date. Each year, the user with the earliest appropriation date (known as the "senior appropriator") may use up to their full allocation (provided the water source can supply it). Then the user with the next earliest appropriation date may use their full allocation and so on. In times of [[drought]], users with junior appropriation dates might not receive their full allocation or even any water at all.

When a water right is sold, it retains its original appropriation date. Only the amount of water historically [[consumptive use of water|consumed]] can be transferred if a water right is sold. For example, if [[alfalfa]] is grown, using [[flood irrigation]], the amount of the [[return flow]] may not be transferred, only the amount that would be necessary to irrigate the amount of alfalfa historically grown. If a water right is not used for a beneficial purpose for a period of time it may lapse under the doctrine of [[Abandonment (legal)|abandonment]]. Abandonment of a water right is rare, but occurred in Colorado in a case involving the South Fork of San Isabel Creek in [[Saguache County, Colorado]].&lt;ref&gt;San Luis Val. Land &amp; Cattle Co. v. Hazard, 114 Colo. 233 (1945).&lt;/ref&gt;

For water sources with many users, a government or quasi-government agency is usually charged with overseeing allocations. Allocations involving water sources that cross state borders or international borders can be quite contentious, and are generally governed by [[Federal government of the United States|federal]] court rulings, interstate agreements and international [[treaty|treaties]].

Even though water markets are increasingly gaining ground, many have criticized the prior appropriation system for failing to adequately adjust to society's evolving values. For example, the vast majority of water in the West still is allocated to agricultural uses despite the cries for additional water from growing cities. Additionally, the high demand for the allocation of water can cause an over-appropriation of the waters. This means that there are more water rights for that particular stream than there is water actually available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.roaringfork.org/pub/collaborative/Appendix_2.1_Citizens_Guide_to_Colorado_Water_Law_2nd_Edition_Excerpt.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-12-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140913105219/http://www.roaringfork.org/pub/collaborative/Appendix_2.1_Citizens_Guide_to_Colorado_Water_Law_2nd_Edition_Excerpt.pdf |archivedate=2014-09-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in Nevada, approximately 45 basins are over-appropriated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dcnr.nv.gov/documents/documents/nevada-water-law-101/]&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, environmentalists and those who use rivers for recreational and/or scenic purposes have demanded that more water be left in rivers in streams.  The prior appropriation system has in many ways inhibited these calls for change.&lt;ref&gt;[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1227745 Brigham Daniels, Emerging Commons Tragic Institutions | Environmental Law | Vol. 37 (2007), pp. 515-571&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Prior appropriation adoptions ==
Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Hawaii, Idaho, Kansas, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Dakota, Utah, Washington, Wyoming all use the prior appropriation doctrine, with permitting and reporting as their regulatory system.&lt;ref name="ncsl.org"&gt;[http://www.ncsl.org/research/environment-and-natural-resources/state-water-withdrawal-regulations.aspx]&lt;/ref&gt;

California and Texas recognize a dual doctrine system that employs both riparian and prior appropriation rights. Oregon mainly uses the prior appropriation doctrine with some remnants of the riparian doctrine.&lt;ref name="ncsl.org" /&gt; Landowners have rights to water on their own land at a certain time at which it is then incorporated into the appropriation system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://freshwater.org/wp-content/uploads/joomla/PDFs/critical-water/waterappropriationsystemsandstateprograms.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

In these cases, riparian rights take precedence, unless they are not claimed by a certain date or are not used within a certain number of years.&lt;ref name="undeerc.org" /&gt;

Arizona adopted the prior appropriation doctrine such that a person could acquire this water right simply by applying it to beneficial use and posting an appropriation notice at the point of diversion. On June 12, 1919, they enacted the Public Water Code in which the person must apply for and obtain a permit for water use.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.azwater.gov/azdwr/SurfaceWater/SurfaceWaterRights/default.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

The appropriation doctrine was adopted in Colorado in 1872 when the territorial court ruled in ''Yunker v. Nichols'', 1 Colo. 552 (1872), that a non-riparian user who had previously applied part of the water from a stream to beneficial use had superior rights to the water with respect to a riparian owner who claimed a right to use of all the water at a later time. The question was not squarely presented again to the Colorado Court until 1882 when in the landmark case, ''Coffin v. Left Hand Ditch Co.'', 6 Colo. 443 (1882), the court explicitly adopted the appropriation doctrine and rejected the riparian doctrine, citing Colorado irrigation and mining practices and the nature of the climate. The decision in ''Coffin'' ruled that prior to adoption of the appropriation doctrine in the Colorado Constitution of 1876 that the riparian doctrine had never been the law in Colorado.&lt;ref name=Colorado&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Colorado Water Right |journal=Columbia Law Review |date=December 1916 |volume=16 |issue=8 |pages=649–664 |author=Ralph Henry Hess |jstor=1110119 |doi=10.2307/1110121}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CWL&gt;{{cite book |last=Vranesh |first=George |title=Colorado Water Law, Volume 1 |year=1987 |publisher=Vranesh Publications |location=Boulder, Colorado |pages=62–63}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within 20 years the appropriation doctrine, the so-called Colorado Doctrine, had been adopted, in whole or part, by most of the states in the Western United States that had an arid climate.&lt;ref name=CWL2&gt;{{cite book |last=Vranesh |first=George |title=Colorado Water Law, Volume 1 |year=1987 |publisher=Vranesh Publications |location=Boulder, Colorado |pages=63–64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New Mexico enacted its appropriate Surface-Water Code in 1907. Later, in 1931, New Mexico enacted the Underground Water Law that adapted the state's surface law to ground water.&lt;ref&gt;[http://opensiuc.lib.siu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1143&amp;context=jcwre]&lt;/ref&gt;

The prior-appropriation doctrine was adopted in 1973 in Montana under the 1973 Water Use Act. Later, they then passed the Montana Ground Water Assessment Act in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dnrc.mt.gov/wrd/water_mgmt/clarkforkbasin_taskforce/pdfs/appropriation_paper.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-12-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130601204624/http://dnrc.mt.gov/wrd/water_mgmt/clarkforkbasin_taskforce/pdfs/appropriation_paper.pdf |archivedate=2013-06-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1967, Texas passed the Water Rights Adjudication Act in regards to surface waters such that the allocation of these waters was under a unified permit system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://texaswater.tamu.edu/water-law]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prior Appropriation Theory applied to other goods==
Water is not the only public good that has been subject to prior appropriation.  The same ''first in time, first in right'' theory has been used in the United States to encourage and give a legal framework for other commercial activities.

The early prospectors and miners in the [[California Gold Rush]] of 1849, and later gold and silver rushes in the western United States, applied appropriation theory to mineral deposits.  The first one to discover and begin mining a deposit was acknowledged to have a legal right to mine.  Because appropriation theory in mineral lands and water rights developed in the same time and place, it is likely that they influenced one another. This was seen in the California case ''Irwin v. Phillips'', 5 Cal. 140 (1855) which decided a water rights dispute between two non-riparian miners on the basis of "first in time, first in right", a maxim drawn from equity.&lt;ref name=CWL3&gt;{{cite book |last=Vranesh |first=George |title=Colorado Water Law, Volume 1 |year=1987 |publisher=Vranesh Publications |location=Boulder, Colorado |pages=62}}&lt;/ref&gt; As with water rights, mining rights could be forfeited by nonuse.  The miners codes were later legalized by the federal government in 1866, and then in the [[Mining Law of 1872]].

The [[Homestead Act]] of 1862 granted legal title to the first farmer to put public land into agricultural production.  This ''first in time'' right to agricultural land may have been influenced by appropriation theory applied to mineral lands.

In recent years, there has been some discussion of limiting air pollution by granting rights to existing pollution sources.  Then it has been argued, a free [[cap and trade]] market could develop in pollution rights.  This would be prior appropriation theory applied to air pollution.  Recent concern over [[carbon dioxide]] and [[global warming]] has led to an economic market in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions, in which some companies wish to balance emissions increases by offsetting decreases in existing emissions sources.  This is essentially acknowledging a prior appropriation right to existing CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emitters.

[[Image:House of Refuge, Randall's Island, New York.jpg|thumb|right|[[New York House of Refuge]], a reform school completed in 1854]]
In the [[United States]], a '''reform school'''  was a [[Prison|penal institution]], generally for [[teenager]]s. In the [[United Kingdom]] and its colonies [[reformatory|reformatories]] were set up from 1830 onwards for youngsters who were convicted of a  crime as an alternative to an adult prison. In parallel, "[[Industrial school]]s" were set up for vagrants and children needing protection. Both were 'certified' by the government from 1850, and in 1930 the systems merged and both were 'approved' and became [[approved school]]s. They were distinct from [[borstal]]s (1902-1982 UK), which were enclosed juvenile prisons.&lt;ref&gt;Australian Government, Cockatoo Island,http://www.cockatooisland.gov.au/about/history/reform-school&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Social reformers in America in the late 19th and early 20th centuries almost invariably found fault with the then-usual practice of treating [[juvenile delinquency|juvenile]] offenders essentially the same as [[adult]] [[criminal]]s.  It was recognized that the juveniles were often [[sex]]ually and otherwise exploited by the older inmates and that they were often receiving instruction in more advanced and serious ways of crime by hardened criminals with little regard for [[law]], [[society]]'s morals, or even [[human]] [[life]].  As a result, rather than their sentences serving as a deterrent to future crimes, many juvenile offenders emerged from incarceration far worse than when they were first sentenced.

The reforms, which were adopted far more readily in some states than others, consisted of a two-pronged approach: a separate [[Minor (law)|juvenile code]] and [[juvenile court]]s for offenders who had not reached the [[age of majority]], and the building of separate institutions for juvenile "delinquents" (the [[social stigma|stigmatizing]] term "criminal" not being used).  Because the primary purpose of these institutions was to be [[Rehabilitation (penology)|rehabilitative]] rather than [[punitive]], they were styled "reform schools".  For the most part, these institutions were custodial.

In the United Kingdom, [[reformatory]] schools  were provided for criminal children whilst [[industrial school]]s were intended to prevent vulnerable children becoming criminal.&lt;ref name=gear&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eprints.ioe.ac.uk/6627/7/DX211996_Redacted.pdf|title=Industrial Schools in England, 1857-1933|publisher=University of London Institute of Education|language=English|author=Gillian Carol Gear|date=1999|accessdate=9 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was a perceived rise in juvenile delinquency in the early 19th century; whereas in a rural economy very young children could gain paid employment doing tasks such as bird scaring and stone gathering these opportunities were not available in the cities. Youngsters were very visible on the streets. In 1816, Parliament set up a ‘Committee for Investigating the Alarming Increase in Juvenile Crime in the Metropolis’, in 1837 the writer Charles Dickens published [[Oliver Twist]] a story about a child involved in a street gang. and in 1847 it was recognised in the [[Juvenile Offences Act of 1847]],  that children under 14 should be tried in a special court not an adult court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Victorian children in trouble with the law - The National Archives|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/education/resources/victorian-children-in-trouble/|website=The National Archives|accessdate=31 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Begging and vagrancy was rife, and it was these low level misdemeanours that caused the magistrates to send vulnerable youngsters to industrial schools to learn to be industrious, and learn skills that would make then more employable.

More serious crimes, required an element of punishment in an environment away from older prisoners followed by education to reform their ways. The power to set up such an establishment was given in the [[1854 Youthful Offenders Act (the Reformatory Schools Act)]]. This provided financial assistance and support for reformatory schools  as an alternative to prison.&lt;ref name=gear/&gt; Industrial schools were regularised three years later by the [[Industrial Schools Act of 1857|1857 Industrial schools act]].&lt;ref name=gear/&gt;

In the 1950s and 1960s, many of the same problems that had occurred with the former system of incarcerating juveniles along with adults began to be noticed in reform school—older juveniles exploiting the younger ones, sexually and otherwise, and the younger ones taking the more hardened, usually older offenders as role models and mentors.  Also, the term "reform school" itself, originally intended as [[Euphemism treadmill|destigmatizing]], had developed its own stigma.{{cn|date=April 2017}}

==Modern view==
Today, no state openly or officially refers to its [[Youth detention center|juvenile correctional institutions]] as "reform schools", although such institutions still exist.  The attempt has also been made to reduce the population of such institutions to the maximum extent possible, and to leave all but the most incorrigible youths in a home setting.  Also, in an attempt to make the situation more socially normal, and in response to the rising number of young female offenders, many such institutions have been made coeducational.

The current approach involves minimizing the use of custodial institutions and the maximization of the use of less-restrictive settings which allow the youths to remain in their own homes, usually while attending during the daytime an institution called an [[alternative school]] or something similar, which is usually a more-structured version of a [[Public school (government funded)|public school]].  There may be court-monitored [[probation]] or other restrictions, such as a strict [[curfew]] applied to the clientele of the "Department of Youth Services" or whatever the state terms it, than for other youths the same age.

In the [[United States]], the most well-known facilities meeting the general criteria for being colloquially labelled "reform schools" include the Lincoln Hills School near [[Merrill, Wisconsin]] (mentioned in episodes of the once-popular [[TV]] series ''[[Picket Fences]]'') and the [[Preston School of Industry]] in [[Ione, California]]. The first publicly funded reform school in the United States was the [[State Reform School for Boys]] in [[Westborough, Massachusetts]]. It opened in 1848.

In [[Denmark]], [[continuation high school|continuation high schools]] continue to be used as reform schools as they are much cheaper than [[youth detention center]]s, while the success rates are much the same.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nyhederne.tv2.dk/krimi/baggrund/article.php/id-8685744.html Når børn begår kriminalitet] (When Children commits crimes), TV2, September 9, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Today, there are no national guidelines regarding the severity of the crimes with which the children are charged; nor are there any guidelines in place to assist in the decision to send them to reform school in the first place, since each town or jurisdiction has its own bylaws and budgets. Children charged with making bomb threats end up in such places.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jv.dk/artikel/196702 14-årig sendes på efterskole efter bombetrussel] (14-year-old being sent to continuation school after bomb threat), By Allan Staal, Jydske Vestkysten, June 17, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''regional Internet registry''' ('''RIR''') is an organization that manages the allocation and registration of [[Internet number]] resources within a particular region of the world. Internet number resources include [[IP address]]es and [[autonomous system (Internet)|autonomous system (AS)]] numbers. 
[[Image:Regional Internet Registries world map.svg|thumb|310px|Map of regional Internet registries]]
[[Image:Regional Internet Registries world map 2002-2005.svg|thumb|230px|Regional Internet registries from 2002–2005]]
[[Image:Regional Internet Registries world map until 2002.svg|thumb|230px|Regional Internet registries until 2002]]

The regional Internet registry system evolved over time, eventually dividing the world into five RIRs:

* The [[AFRINIC|African Network Information Center (AFRINIC)]] serves [[Africa]]&lt;ref name="afrinic"&gt;[http://www.afrinic.net African Network Information Centre]&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[American Registry for Internet Numbers|American Registry for Internet Numbers (ARIN)]] serves [[Antarctica]], [[Canada]], parts of the [[Caribbean]], and the [[United States]]&lt;ref name="arin"&gt;[http://www.arin.net American Registry for Internet Numbers]&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Asia-Pacific Network Information Centre|Asia-Pacific Network Information Centre (APNIC)]] serves [[East Asia]], [[Oceania]], [[South Asia]], and [[Southeast Asia]]&lt;ref name="apnic"&gt;[http://www.apnic.net Asia-Pacific Network Information Centre]&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Latin America and Caribbean Network Information Centre|Latin America and Caribbean Network Information Centre (LACNIC)]] serves most of the [[Caribbean]] and all of [[Latin America]]&lt;ref name="lacnic"&gt;[http://www.lacnic.net Latin America and Caribbean Network Information Centre]&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[RIPE NCC|Réseaux IP Européens Network Coordination Centre (RIPE NCC)]] serves [[Europe]], [[Central Asia]], [[Russia]], and [[West Asia]]&lt;ref name="ripe"&gt;[http://www.ripe.net RIPE Network Coordination Centre]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Internet Assigned Numbers Authority==
Regional Internet Registries are components of the Internet Number Registry System, which is described in [[IETF]] {{IETF RFC|7020}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite ietf |rfc=7020|title=The Internet Numbers Registry System |author=R. Housley, J. Curran, G. Huston, D. Conrad |date=August 2013 |publisher=[[Internet Engineering Task Force|IETF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority]] (IANA) delegates Internet resources to the RIRs who, in turn, follow their regional policies to delegate resources to their customers, which include [[Internet service provider]]s and end-user organizations. Collectively, the RIRs participate in the [[Number Resource Organization]] (NRO),&lt;ref name=nro&gt;[http://www.nro.net/ Number Resource Organization]&lt;/ref&gt; formed as a body to represent their collective interests, undertake joint activities, and coordinate their activities globally. The NRO has entered into an agreement with [[Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers|ICANN]] for the establishment of the [[Address Supporting Organisation]] (ASO),&lt;ref name=aso&gt;[http://www.aso.icann.org The Address Supporting Organization]&lt;/ref&gt; which undertakes coordination of global IP addressing policies within the ICANN framework.

==Number Resource Organization==
The '''Number Resource Organization'''&lt;ref name="nro"/&gt; ('''NRO''') is an unincorporated organization uniting the five RIRs. It came into existence on October 24, 2003, when the four existing RIRs entered into a [[memorandum of understanding]] (MoU) in order to undertake joint activities, including joint technical projects, liaison activities and policy co-ordination.

[[AFRINIC]], which was officially created in April 2005, joined on April 25, 2005.

The main aims of the NRO are to:

* Protect the unallocated [[IP address|IP]] number resource pool,
* Promote and protect the bottom-up policy development process of the [[Internet]], and
* Act as a focal point for [[Internet community]] input into the RIR system.

==Local Internet registry==
A '''local Internet registry''' ('''LIR''') is an organization that has been allocated a block of [[IP address]]es by a RIR, and that assigns most parts of this block to its own customers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.arin.net/policy/nrpm.html#two4 |title=ARIN Number Resource Policy Manual: Local Internet Registry (LIR)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most LIRs are [[Internet service provider]]s, enterprises, or academic institutions. Membership in a regional Internet registry is required to become an LIR.

'''Ronald Harry Coase''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|oʊ|s}}; 29 December 1910 – 2 September 2013) was a British economist and author. He was the Clifton R. Musser Professor of Economics at the [[University of Chicago Law School]], where he arrived in 1964 and remained for the rest of his life. He received the [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]] in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Hahn |first1=Robert |title=Ronald Harry Coase (1910–2013) Nobel-prize winning economist whose work inspired cap-and-trade |doi=10.1038/502449a |journal=Nature |volume=502 |issue=7472 |page=449 |year=2013 |pmid= |pmc=|bibcode=2013Natur.502..449H }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coase, who believed economists should study real markets and not theoretical ones,  established the case for the corporation as a means to pay the costs of operating a marketplace.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324432404579053032911966114 Henderson, David R.,The man who resisted blackboard economics, Wall Street Journal, 4 September 2013, p. A15]&lt;/ref&gt; Coase is best known for two articles in particular: "[[The Nature of the Firm]]" (1937), which introduces the concept of [[transaction cost]]s to explain the nature and limits of [[Corporation|firms]]; and "[[The Problem of Social Cost]]" (1960), which suggests that well-defined [[Property rights (economics)|property rights]] could overcome the problems of [[externalities]] (see [[Coase theorem]]). Additionally, Coase's transaction costs approach is currently influential in modern organizational economics, where it was reintroduced by [[Oliver E. Williamson]].

==Biography==
[[File:Coase scan 11 edited.jpg|thumb|left|Scanned photo of Coase from UChicago Law archives]]
Ronald Harry Coase was born in [[Willesden]], a suburb of London, on 29 December 1910. His father, Henry Joseph Coase (1884–1973)  was a [[telegraphist]] for the post office, as was his mother, Rosalie Elizabeth Coase (née Giles; 1882–1972), before marriage. As a child, Coase had a weakness in his legs, for which he was required to wear [[Brace (orthopaedic)|leg-irons]]. Due to this problem, he attended the school for physical defectives. At the age of 12, he was able to enter the Kilburn Grammar School on scholarship. At Kilburn, he studied for the intermediate examination of the [[University of London]] as an [[University of London International Programmes|external student]] in 1927–29.&lt;ref name="Coase Autobiography"&gt;[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economics/laureates/1991/coase-autobio.html Ronald Coase.  "Nobel Prize Autobiography," 1991]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Breit, William and Barry T. Hirsch. Lives of the Laureates, 4th ed. Cambridge, Mass: The MIT Press, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Coase married Marion Ruth Hartung of Chicago, Illinois in Willesden, England, 7 August 1937. Although they were unable to have children, they were married 75 years until her death in 2012, making him one of the longest-married Nobel Prize laureates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/education/2013/sep/04/ronald-coase|title=Ronald Coase obituary|last=Littlewood|first=Mark|date=2013-09-04|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coase attended the [[London School of Economics]], where he took courses with [[Arnold Plant]]&lt;ref name="Coase Autobiography" /&gt; and received a [[bachelor of commerce]] degree in 1932. During his undergraduate studies, Coase received the Sir Ernest Cassel Travelling Scholarship, awarded by the University of London. He used this to visit the University of Chicago in 1931–1932 and studied with [[Frank Knight]] and [[Jacob Viner]]. Coase's colleagues would later admit that they did not remember this first visit.&lt;ref name="FireofTruth"&gt;{{cite journal |journal=[[Journal of Law and Economics]] |last=Kitch |first=Edmund W. |title=The Fire of Truth: A Remembrance of Law and Economics at Chicago, 1932–1970 |volume=26 |issue=1 |year=1983 |pages=163–234 |jstor=725189}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1932–34, Coase was an assistant lecturer at the Dundee School of Economics and Commerce, which later became part of the [[University of Dundee]]. Subsequently, Coase was an assistant lecturer in commerce at the [[University of Liverpool]] between 1934–1935 before returning to [[London School of Economics]] as a member of staff until 1951. He then started to work at the [[University at Buffalo, The State University of New York|University at Buffalo]] and retained his British citizenship after moving to the United States in the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://alb.merlinone.net/mweb/wmsql.wm.request?oneimage&amp;imageid=5579499/ |title=U. of Chicago Professor Wins Nobel Economics Prize}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1958, he moved to the [[University of Virginia]]. Coase settled at the [[University of Chicago]] in 1964 and became the editor of the ''[[Journal of Law and Economics]]''.

==Contributions to economics==

===The Nature of the Firm===
{{Main|The Nature of the Firm}}
In "The Nature of the Firm" (1937), a brief but highly influential essay, Coase attempts to explain why the economy features a number of [[corporation|business firms]] instead of consisting exclusively of a multitude of independent, [[self-employed]] people who contract with one another. Given that "production could be carried on without any organization [that is, firms] at all", Coase asks, why and under what conditions should we expect firms to emerge?

Since modern firms can only emerge when an entrepreneur of some sort begins to hire people, Coase's analysis proceeds by considering the conditions under which it makes sense for an entrepreneur to seek hired help instead of contracting out for some particular task.

The traditional economic theory of the time (in the tradition of [[Adam Smith]]) suggested that, because the market is "efficient" (that is, those who are best at providing each good or service most cheaply are already doing so), it should always be cheaper to contract out than to hire.

Coase noted, however, a number of [[transaction cost]]s involved in using the market; the cost of obtaining a good or service via the market actually exceeds the price of the good. Other costs, including search and information costs, bargaining costs, keeping [[trade secret]]s, and policing and enforcement costs, can all potentially add to the cost of procuring something from another party. This suggests that firms will arise which can internalise the production of goods and services required to deliver a product, thus avoiding these costs. This argument sets the stage for the later contributions by [[Oliver Williamson]]: markets and hierarchies are alternative co-ordination mechanisms for economic transactions.&lt;ref&gt;Hein Schreuder, "Coase, Hayek and Hierarchy", In: S. Lindenberg &amp; [[Hein Schreuder]], editors, Interdisciplinary Perspectives on Organization Studies, Pergamon Press&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a natural limit to what a firm can produce internally, however. Coase notices "decreasing returns to the entrepreneur function", including increasing [[overhead expenses|overhead costs]] and increasing propensity for an overwhelmed manager to make mistakes in resource allocation. These factors become countervailing costs to the use of the firm.

Coase argues that the size of a firm (as measured by how many contractual relations are "internal" to the firm and how many "external") is a result of finding an optimal balance between the competing tendencies of the costs outlined above. In general, making the firm larger will initially be advantageous, but the decreasing returns indicated above will eventually kick in, preventing the firm from growing indefinitely.

Other things being equal, therefore, a firm will tend to be larger:
* the lower the costs of organising and the slower these costs rise with an increase in the number of transactions organised
* the less likely the entrepreneur is to make mistakes and the smaller the increase in mistakes with an increase in the transactions organised
* the greater the lowering (or the smaller the rise) in the supply price of factors of production to firms of larger size

The first two costs will increase with the spatial distribution of the transactions organised and the dissimilarity of the transactions. This explains why firms tend to either be in different geographic locations or to perform different functions. Additionally, technology changes that mitigate the cost of organising transactions across space may allow firms to become larger – the advent of the telephone and of cheap air travel, for example, would be expected to increase the size of firms.

===The Problem of Social Cost===
{{Main|The Problem of Social Cost}}
[[File:Coase working 2000s.jpg|thumb|Coase working in 2003 ( photo taken at and by University of Chicago Law School)]]
Upon publishing his article The Federal Communications Commission in 1959, Coase received negative feedback from the faculty at the University of Chicago over his conclusions and apparent conflicts with [[Arthur Cecil Pigou|A. C. Pigou]]. According to Coase, "What I said was thought to run counter to Pigou's analysis by a number of economists at the [[University of Chicago]] and was therefore, according to them, wrong.  At a meeting in Chicago I was able to convince these economists that I was right and Pigou's analysis faulty." Coase had presented his paper in 1960 during a seminar in Chicago, to twenty senior economist including [[George Stigler]] and [[Milton Friedman]]. He gradually won over the usually skeptic audience, in what has later been considered a "paradigm-shifting moment" in the genesis of Chicago Law and Economics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=William |last=Davies |title=The Limits of Neoliberalism: Authority, Sovereignty and the Logic of Competition |location= |publisher=SAGE |year=2014 |isbn= 9781473905337|pages=87–90 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6119AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT87}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coase would join the Chicago faculty four years later.

Published in the ''Journal of Law and Economics'' in 1960, while Coase was a member of the Economics department at the [[University of Virginia]], "The Problem of [[Social Cost]]" provided the key insight that it is unclear where the blame for externalities lies. The example he gave was of a rancher whose cattle stray onto the cropland of his neighbour. If the rancher is made to restrict his cattle, he is harmed just as the farmer is if the cattle remain unrestrained.

Coase argued that without [[transaction cost]]s the initial assignment of property rights makes no difference to whether or not the farmer and rancher can achieve the economically efficient outcome. If the cost of restraining cattle by, say, building a fence, is less than the cost of crop damage, the fence will be built. The initial assignment of property rights determines who builds the fence. If the farmer is responsible for the crop damage, the farmer will pay for the fence (as long the fence costs less than the crop damage). The allocation of property rights is primarily an equity issue, with consequences for the distribution of income and wealth, rather than an efficiency issue.

With sufficient transaction costs, initial property rights matter for both equity and efficiency. From the point of view of economic efficiency, property rights should be assigned such that the owner of the rights wants to take the economically efficient action. To elaborate, if it is efficient not to restrict the cattle, the rancher should be given the rights (so that cattle can move about freely), whereas if it is efficient to restrict the cattle, the farmer should be given the rights over the movement of the cattle (so the cattle are restricted).

This seminal argument forms the basis of the famous [[Coase theorem]] as labelled by Stigler.

===Law and economics===
[[File:Coase profile 2003.jpg|thumb|Coase profile photo in 2003 (photo taken at and by University of Chicago Law School)]]
Though trained as an economist, Coase spent much of his career working in a law school.  He is a central figure in the development of the subfield of [[law and economics]].  He viewed law and economics as having two parts, the first "using the economists' approach and concepts to analyze the working of the legal system, often called the economic analysis of the law"; and the second "a study of the influence of the legal system on the working of the economic system."&lt;ref name="LESimpson" /&gt;  Coase said that the second part "is the part of law and economics in which I am most interested."

In his Simons Lecture celebrating the centennial of the University of Chicago, titled "Law and Economics at Chicago", Coase noted that he only accidentally wandered into the field:

{{Quote | text = It is generally agreed that this article has had an immense influence on legal scholarship, but this was no part of my intention. For me, "The Problem of Social Cost" was an essay in economics. It was aimed at economists. What I wanted to do was to improve our analysis of the working of the economic system.  Law came into article because, in a regime of positive transaction costs, the character of the law becomes one of the main factors determining the performance of the economy. If transaction costs were zero (as is assumed in standard economic theory) we can imagine people contracting around the law whenever the value of production would be increased by a change in the legal position. But in a regime of positive transaction costs, such contracting would not occur whenever transaction costs were greater than the gain that such a redistribution of rights would bring. As a consequence the rights which individuals possess will commonly be those established by the law, which in these circumstances can be said to control the economy. As I have said, in "The Problem of Social Cost" I had no intention of making a contribution to legal scholarship. I referred to legal cases because they afforded examples of real situations as against the imaginary ones normally used by economists in their analysis. It was undoubtedly an economist who invented the widget. But in "The Problem of Social Cost" I did something else. I pointed out that the judges in their opinions often seemed to show a better understanding of the economic problem than did many economists even though their views were not always expressed in a very explicit fashion. I did this not to praise the judges but to shame economists.&lt;ref name="LEChicago" /&gt;}}

Despite wandering accidentally into law and economics, the opportunity to edit the Journal of Law and Economics was instrumental in bringing him to the University of Chicago:

{{Quote| text = [W]hen I was approached to fill Aaron Director's place on his retirement, what I found most attractive about coming to Chicago was the opportunity it gave me of editing the Journal. Indeed, it is probable that without the Journal I would not have come to Chicago. I knew nothing of the original aim of the Journal. What I wanted to do was to encourage the type of research which I had advocated in "The Problem of Social Cost," and I used my editorship of the Journal as a means of bringing this about.&lt;ref name="LEChicago"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Law and Economics at Chicago |last=Coase |first=R. H. |journal=[[Journal of Law and Economics]] |volume=36 |issue=1 |year=1993 |pages=239–54 |jstor=725475}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Coase believed that the University of Chicago was the intellectual center of law and economics. He concluded his Simons lecture by stating:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I am very much aware that, in concentrating in this lecture on law and economics at Chicago, I have neglected other significant contributions to the subject made elsewhere such as those by Guido Calabresi at Yale, by Donald Turner at Harvard, and by others. But it can hardly be denied that in the emergence of the subject of law and economics, Chicago has played a very significant part and one of which the University can be proud.&lt;ref name="LEChicago" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Coase Conjecture===
Another important contribution of Coase is the [[Coase conjecture]], which states that an informal argument that durable-goods [[monopoly|monopolists]] do not have market power because they are unable to commit to not lowering their prices in future periods.

==Political views==
When asked what he considered his politics to be, Coase stated,

&lt;blockquote&gt;I really don't know. I don't reject any policy without considering what its results are. If someone says there's going to be [[regulatory economics|regulation]], I don't say that regulation will be bad. Let's see. What we discover is that most regulation does produce, or has produced in recent times, a worse result. But I wouldn't like to say that all regulation would have this effect because one can think of circumstances in which it doesn't.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Looking for results |publisher=Reason magazine |url=http://reason.com/archives/1997/01/01/looking-for-results/1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Coase admitted that early in life, he aligned himself with socialism.

{{Quote |text = As a young man I was a Socialist. The first challenge to this belief came when, in 1931, 5 months before I took the final examinations for the B.Com. degree, I attended [[Arnold Plant]]'s seminar at the London School of Economics (LSE). He introduced me to Adam Smith's invisible hand and to the advantages of a competitive system. He also pointed out that government schemes in the economic sphere were often ill-conceived and were introduced to placate special interests. I adopted many of Plant's positions but continued to regard myself as a Socialist. That this meant holding what could be considered, and were, inconsistent positions was not unusual at that time. [[Abba Lerner]], a fellow student and a fine theorist, with whom I had a very friendly relation, also believed in the virtues of a competitive system but was even more attached to Socialism than I was.&lt;ref name="LESimpson"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Law and Economics and A.W. Brian Simpson |first=R. H. |last=Coase |journal=[[Journal of Legal Studies]] |volume=25 |issue=1 |pages=103–19 |jstor=724523 |date=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Guido Calabresi]] wrote that Coase's focus on transaction costs in ''The Nature of the Firm'' was the result of his socialist beliefs. Reflecting on this, Coase wrote: "It is very difficult to know where one's ideas come from but for all I know he may well be right." Coase continued:

{{Quote | text = My socialist sympathies gradually fell away and this process was accentuated as a result of being assigned in 1935 at LSE the course on the Economics of Public Utilities.  I soon found out that very little was known about British public utilities and I set about making a series of historical studies on the water, gas, and electricity supply industries and of the Post Office and broadcasting.

These researches taught me much about the public utility industries and they certainly made me aware of the defects of government operation of these industries, whether municipal or through nationalisation.  These researches were interrupted by the war, when I joined the civil service, at first, for a short period, in the [[Forestry Commission]], then responsible for timber production, and for the rest of the war, in the [[Central Statistical Office (United Kingdom)|Central Statistical Office]], one of the offices of the War Cabinet. This war-time experience did not significantly influence my views but I could not help noticing that, with the country in mortal danger and despite the leadership of Winston Churchill, government departments often seemed more concerned to defend their own interests than those of the country.&lt;ref name="LESimpson" /&gt;}}

==The Ronald Coase Institute==
Coase was research advisor to the [[Ronald Coase Institute]], an organisation that promotes research on institutions and organizations – the laws, rules, customs, and norms – that govern real economic systems, with particular support for young scholars from developing and transitional countries.

==The Coase-Sandor Institute for Law and Economics==
[[File:Coase b&amp;w2.jpg|thumb|Coase at a conference in 2008 with Richard Sandor in the background (from UChicago Law archives)]]
The University of Chicago Law School carries on the legacy of Ronald Coase through the mission of the Coase-Sandor Institute for Law and Economics.  Each year, the University of Chicago Law School hosts the Coase Lecture, which was delivered in 2003 by Ronald Coase himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.law.uchicago.edu/node/1291 |title=2003 Coase Lecture: Ronald Coase, "The Present and Future of Law and Economics"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[law]], a '''special referee''' acts as a [[judge]] on matters of fact only.

==Explanation==
In many instances, the interpretation of the specific [[statute]]s or [[case law]] relevant to a dispute is absolutely clear. The uncertainty between the [[party (law)|parties]] lies in the facts. Hence, a special referee is an expert in the factual topic, whether it be shipping, civil engineering, accounting, etc. He or she hears evidence and makes factual findings which bind the parties. This will usually be sufficient for the parties to resolve the dispute since the law can now be applied. If the parties still cannot agree, they may initiate proceedings for [[arbitration]] or [[litigation]] but, on an [[inter partes]] basis, the facts are conclusively determined by the [[Judgment (law)|judgment]] of the special referee and only questions of law may be argued before the new forum. Thus, the use of a special referee provides a relatively swift and cost-effective mechanism for [[dispute resolution]] if only because the procedure is less formal than in a court and the referee's existing expertise reduces the need to continually explain complex technical and factual matters to a judge who has only legal expertise.

==Scope==
The parties may anticipate the possibility of a dispute and nominate a special referee as the most appropriate form of dispute resolution (see [[forum selection clause]]). Such clauses cannot limit or deny the right of either party to refer the matter to a court (whether in the [[Jurisdiction (area)|state]] nominated or, if the contract does not specify a state, in any court prepared to accept jurisdiction subject to the rules on [[forum shopping]]).

If there is no anticipatory provision in the contract, the parties may, of their own initiative, seek out a person qualified to act as a special referee and submit the factual case to him or her for resolution. Although costs will be involved in legal representation, fees to witnesses, and in the fee to the special referee, the expenditure will be a fraction of the costs of full-scale litigation.

If there is no agreement between the parties, the [[civil procedure]] of many states allows the court to refer the matter to a special referee when this will both provide exertise on the facts, and enable the legal case to be disposed of in a more timely fashion. For example, in [[Canada]], the Arbitration Act provides:
:14. (1) Subject to rules of court and to any right to have particular cases tried by a jury, the court or a judge may refer any question arising in any cause or matter, other than a criminal proceeding by the Crown, to an official or special referee for inquiry or report.
:(2) The report of an official or special referee may be adopted wholly or partially by the court or a judge, and if so adopted may be enforced as a judgment or order to the same effect.

As with most legal terminology, there is some variation by jurisdiction in the precise nomenclature used: in some jurisdictions a special referee is known as a "master", "special master" or "auditor".

'''State socialism''' is a classification for any [[Socialism|socialist]] [[Political ideology|political]] and [[Economic ideology|economic perspective]] advocating [[State (polity)|state]] ownership of the [[means of production]] either as a temporary measure in the transition from [[Capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalism]] to [[Socialist mode of production|socialism]], or as characteristic of socialism itself.&lt;ref&gt;"State Socialism and Anarchism".

State socialism is held in contrast with libertarian socialism, which rejects the view that socialism can be constructed by using existing state institutions or by governmental policies. By contrast, proponents of state socialism claim that the state—through practical considerations of governing—must play at least a temporary part in building socialism. It is possible to conceive of a democratic state that owns the means of production, but it is internally organized in a participatory, cooperative fashion, thereby achieving both [[social ownership]] of productive property and [[workplace democracy]] in day-to-day operations.

== History ==
The philosophy of state socialism was first explicitly expounded by [[Ferdinand Lassalle]]. In contrast to [[Karl Marx]]'s perspective, Lassalle rejected the concept of the [[State (polity)|state]] as a class-based power structure whose main function was to preserve existing class structures, therefore Lassalle also rejected the [[Marxism|Marxist]] view that the state was destined to "[[Withering away of the state|wither away]]". Lassalle considered the state to be an entity independent of class allegiances and as an instrument of justice that would therefore be essential for the achievement of socialism.{{Sfn|Berlau|1949|p=21}}

Early concepts of state socialism were articulated by [[Anarchism|anarchist]] and [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] philosophers who opposed the concept of the state. In ''[[Statism and Anarchy]]'', [[Mikhail Bakunin]] identified a [[Statism|statist]] tendency within the Marxist movement, which he contrasted to [[Social anarchism|anarchist socialism]] and attributed to Marx’s philosophy. Bakunin predicted that Marx’s theory of transition from [[capitalism]] to [[socialism]] involving the working class seizing state power in a [[dictatorship of the proletariat]] would eventually lead to an usurpation of power by the state apparatus acting in its own self-interest, ushering in a new form of capitalism rather than establishing socialism.&lt;ref&gt;''Statism and Anarchy''. Retrieved October 12, 2011, from marxists.org: http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/bakunin/works/1873/statism-anarchy.htm: "The theory of statism as well as that of so-called ‘revolutionary dictatorship’ is based on the idea that a ‘privileged elite,’ consisting of those scientists and ‘doctrinaire revolutionists’ who believe that ‘theory is prior to social experience,’ should impose their preconceived scheme of social organization on the people. The dictatorial power of this learned minority is concealed by the fiction of a pseudo-representative government which presumes to express the will of the people."&lt;/ref&gt;

As a political ideology, state socialism rose to prominence during the 20th century [[Bolshevik]], [[Leninist]] and later [[Marxism–Leninism|Marxist–Leninist]] revolutions where single-party control over the state and by extension over the political and economic spheres of society was justified as a means to safeguard the [[Communist revolution|revolution]] against [[counter-revolutionary]] insurrection and foreign invasion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Flank|first= Lenny |title= Rise and Fall of the Leninist State: A Marxist History of the Soviet Union |publisher=Red and Black Publishers|date=August 2008|isbn= 1-931859-25-6|page = 57|quote=Lenin defended his actions, arguing that the Revolution could be consolidated 'only through dictatorship, because the realization of the transformations immediately and unconditionally necessary for the proletariat and the peasantry will call forth the desperate resistance of the landlords, of the big bourgeoisie, and of Tsarism. Without dictatorship, it would be impossible to defeat counter-revolutionary efforts.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Stalinist]] theory of [[socialism in one country]] was an attempt to legitimize state-directed activity in an effort to accelerate the [[History of the Soviet Union (1927–53)#Industrialization in practice|industrialisation of the Soviet Union]].

== Description and theory ==
As a political ideology, state socialism is one of the major dividing lines in the broader socialist movement. It is often contrasted non-state or anti-state forms of socialism, such as those that advocate direct [[Socialism#Self-managed economy|self-management]], [[adhocracy]] and direct [[worker's cooperative|cooperative]] ownership and management of the means of production. Political philosophies contrasted to state socialism include [[libertarian socialism]], [[Social anarchism|anarchist socialism]], [[anarcho-communism]], [[syndicalism]], [[Mutualism (economic theory)|free market socialism]], [[De Leonism]] and [[economic democracy]]. These forms of socialism are opposed to hierarchical [[Technocracy|technocratic socialism]], [[scientific management]] and [[Economic planning|state-directed economic planning]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://lra.le.ac.uk/handle/2381/3186|title=Leicester Research Archive: Redistribution Under State Socialism: A USSR and PRC Comparison|publisher=lra.le.ac.uk|accessdate=21 March 2008|last=|first=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern concept of state socialism, when used in reference to Soviet-style economic and political systems, emerged from a deviation in Marxist theory starting with [[Vladimir Lenin]]. In [[Marxism|Marxist theory]], socialism is projected to emerge in the most developed capitalist economies where capitalism suffers the greatest amount of internal contradictions and class conflict. On the other hand, "state socialism" became a revolutionary theory for the poorest, often quasi-feudal, countries of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1= Bertrand Badie |author2= Dirk Berg-Schlosser |author3= Leonardo Morlino |title= International Encyclopedia of Political Science |publisher= SAGE Publications, Inc |year= 2011|month= |isbn= 978-1412959636|page = 2457|quote=Marxist theory was elaborated for, and based on, the most developed countries of the world. Although the state socialist project originated from Marxist theory, it was, however, a deviation from the original theory of Karl Marx. The application of this theory in backward countries, starting with Lenin’s Russia, can be considered as turning it to the other extreme – that is, to a revolutionary theory for the poorest countries of the world}}&lt;/ref&gt; In such systems, the state apparatus is used as an instrument of capital accumulation, forcibly extracting surplus from the working class and peasantry for the purposes of modernizing and industrializing poor countries. Such systems are described as [[state capitalism]] because the state engages in capital accumulation. However, there is a clear difference between those two concepts. In state socialism, the state as a public entity engages in this activity in order to achieve socialism by re-investing the accumulated capital into the society whether be in more healthcare, education, employment or consumer goods, whereas in capitalist societies the surplus extracted from the working class is spent in whatever needs the owners of the means of production wants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1= Bertrand Badie |author2= Dirk Berg-Schlosser |author3= Leonardo Morlino |title= International Encyclopedia of Political Science |publisher= SAGE Publications, Inc |year= 2011|month= |isbn= 978-1412959636|page = 2459|quote=The repressive state apparatus is in fact acting as an instrument of state capitalism to carry out the process of capital accumulation through forcible extraction of surplus from the working class and peasantry }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The role of the state in socialism ===
In the traditional view of socialism, thinkers including [[Fredrick Engels]] and [[Claude Henri de Rouvroy, comte de Saint-Simon|Saint-Simon]] took the position that the state will change in nature in a socialist society, with the function of the state changing from one of "political rule" over people into a scientific administration of the processes of production. Specifically, the state would become a coordinating economic entity consisting of interdependent inclusive associations rather than a mechanism of class and political control&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica, ''Saint Simon''; ''Socialism''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Socialism: Utopian and Scientific'', on Marxists.org: http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1880/soc-utop/ch01.htm: "In 1816, he declares that politics is the science of production, and foretells the complete absorption of politics by economics. The knowledge that economic conditions are the basis of political institutions appears here only in embryo. Yet what is here already very plainly expressed is the idea of the future conversion of political rule over men into an administration of things and a direction of processes of production."&lt;/ref&gt; and in the process it would cease to be a state in the traditional definition. In Marxist theory, socialism would eventually give way to a stateless [[communist society]].

Preceding the Bolshevik-led revolution in Russia, many socialist groups including [[Reformism|reformists]], [[orthodox Marxist]] currents such as [[council communism]] and the [[Mensheviks]], anarchists and libertarian socialists criticised the idea of using the state to conduct central planning and nationalization of the means of production as a way to establish socialism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Screpanti and Zamagni|first=  |others=|title= An Outline on the History of Economic Thought|edition= 2nd |series=|year= 2005 |origyear=|publisher=Oxford |location=  |isbn=  |oclc= |chapter= |chapterurl=|quote= It should not be forgotten, however, that in the period of the Second International, some of the reformist currents of Marxism, as well as some of the extreme left-wing ones, not to speak of the anarchist groups, had already criticised the view that State ownership and central planning is the best road to socialism. But with the victory of Leninism in Russia, all dissent was silenced, and socialism became identified with ‘democratic centralism’, ‘central planning’, and State ownership of the means of production.|ref= p. 295 |bibcode= |laysummary= |laydate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Political perspectives ==
State socialism was traditionally advocated as a means for achieving [[public ownership]] of the means of production through [[nationalization]] of industry. This was intended to be a transitional phase in the process of building a socialist economy. The goals of nationalization were to dispossess large capitalists and consolidate industry so that profit would go toward [[public finance]] rather than private fortune. Nationalization would be the first step in a long-term process of socializing production: introducing employee management and reorganizing production to [[Production for use|directly produce for use]] rather than profit.&lt;ref name="The Economics of Feasible Socialism Revisted, 1991. P.176"&gt;''The Economics of Feasible Socialism Revisited'', by Nove, Alexander. 1991. (P.176): "The original notion was that nationalization would achieve three objectives. One was to dispossess the big capitalists. The second was to divert the profits from private appropriation to the public purse. Thirdly, the nationalized sector would serve the public good rather than try to make private profits...To these objectives some (but not all) would add some sort of workers' control, the accountability of management to employees."&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditional [[social democrats]] and non-revolutionary [[Democratic socialism|democratic socialists]] argued for a gradual, peaceful transition from capitalism to socialism. They wish to neutralize or to abolish capitalism, respectively, but through political reform rather than [[revolution]]. This method of gradualism implies utilization of the existing state apparatus and machinery of government to gradually move society toward socialism and is sometimes derided by other socialists as a form of "socialism from above" or political "elitism" for relying on electoral means to achieve socialism.&lt;ref&gt;''The Two Souls of Socialism'', Draper, Hal. http://www.anu.edu.au/polsci/marx/contemp/pamsetc/twosouls/twosouls.htm: "Ferdinand Lassalle is the prototype of the state-socialist -- which means, one who aims to get socialism handed down by the existing state."&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, [[Marxism|Marxist socialism]] and [[revolutionary socialism]] holds that a [[Proletarian Revolution|socialist revolution]] is the only practical way to implement fundamental changes in the structure of society. Socialists who advocate [[representative democracy]] believe that after a certain period of time under socialism the state will "wither away" because class distinctions cease to exist and representative democracy would be replaced by [[direct democracy]] in the remaining public associations comprising the former state. Political power would be decentralized and distributed evenly among the population, producing a [[communism|communist]] society.

== State socialism in Communist states ==
{{main|Communist state}}
The economic model adopted in the former [[Soviet Union]], [[Eastern Europe]] and other [[Communist state|Communist states]] is often described as a form of state socialism. The ideological basis for this system was the Marxist–Leninist theory of [[Socialism in One Country|socialism in one country]]. The system that emerged in the 1930s in the Soviet Union was based on state ownership of the means of production and centralized planning, along with bureaucratic management of the workplace by state officials that were ultimately subordinate to the all-encompassing communist party. Rather than the producers controlling and managing production, the party controlled both the government machinery which directed the national economy on behalf of the communist party, and planned the production and distribution of capital goods.

Because of this, [[Classical Marxism|classical]] and [[Orthodox Marxism|orthodox Marxists]] as well as [[Trotskyist]] groups denounced the "Communist" states as being [[Stalinism|Stalinist]] and their economies as being [[State capitalism|state capitalist]] or representing [[degenerated workers' state]]s, respectively.

Trotskyism argues that the leadership of the Communist states was corrupt and that it abandoned Marxism in all but name. In particular, some [[Trotskyist]] schools call those countries [[degenerated workers' state]]s to contrast them with proper socialism (i.e. workers' states), while other Trotskyist schools call them state capitalist to emphasise the lack of true socialism and presence of defining capitalist characteristics (wage labor, commodity production and bureaucratic control over workers).

== Bismarck's social policy ==
{{main|State Socialism (Germany)}}
[[Otto von Bismarck]] implemented a set of social programs between 1883–1889 following his [[anti-socialist laws]], partly as remedial measures to appease the working class and detract support for the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (SPD). Bismarck's biographer [[A. J. P. Taylor]] said: "It would be unfair to say that Bismarck took up social welfare solely to weaken the Social Democrats; he had had it in mind for a long time, and believed in it deeply. But as usual he acted on his beliefs at the exact moment when they served a practical need".&lt;ref&gt;A. J. P. Taylor, ''Bismarck. The Man and the Statesman'' (London: Hamish Hamilton, 1955), p. 202.&lt;/ref&gt; When a reference was made to his friendship with [[Ferdinand Lassalle]] (a nationalist and state-oriented socialist), Bismarck said that he was a more practical "socialist" than the Social Democrats.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, p. 202.&lt;/ref&gt; These policies were informally referred to as "State Socialism" by liberal and conservative opponents and the term was later adopted by supporters of the programs in a further attempt to detract the working class from the SPD, with the goal of making the working class content with a nationalist-oriented capitalist [[welfare state]].&lt;ref&gt;''Bismarck'', Edgar Feuchtwanger, (2002) p. 221.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Bismarck’s Reichstag Speech on the Law for Workers’ Compensation", March 15, 1884: http://germanhistorydocs.ghi-dc.org/sub_document.cfm?document_id=1809&lt;/ref&gt;

Otto von Bismarck made the following statement on his social welfare programs: &lt;blockquote&gt;Whoever has pensions for his old age is far more easier to handle than one who has no such prospect. Look at the difference between a private servant in the chancellery or at court; the latter will put up with much more, because he has a pension to look forward to.&lt;ref&gt;A. J. P. Taylor, ''Bismarck. The Man and the Statesman'' (London: Hamish Hamilton, 1955), p. 203.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Criticisms ==
Many [[Libertarian socialism|libertarian socialists]], [[Syndicalism|syndicalists]], [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualists]] and [[Anarchism|anarchists]] go further in their critique, deriding even [[Marxism]] as state socialism for its support of a temporary, proletarian state instead of abolishing the state apparatus outright. They use the term in contrast with their own form of socialism, which involves either [[collective ownership]] (in the form of [[worker cooperatives]]) or [[common ownership]] of the means of production without state economic planning. Libertarian socialists and anarchists believe there is no need for a state in a socialist system because there would be no class to suppress and no need for an institution based on coercion and thus regard the state being a remnant of capitalism. Most also hold that [[statism]] is itself antithetical to true socialism, the goal of which is the eyes of libertarian socialists such as [[William Morris]]: "To destroy the state and put free society in its place".

State socialism is often referred to by detractors simply as "socialism". For example, Austrian economists such as [[Ludwig Von Mises]] and [[Friedrich Hayek]] continually used the word "socialism" as a synonym for state socialism and [[central planning]]. The attributive "state" is usually added by socialists with a non-state based method for achieving socialism to criticize state socialism.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} [[Anarcho-syndicalism|Anarcho-syndicalists]] and following on from [[Tony Cliff]], many [[Trotskyism|Troskyists]], deny that it even is socialism, calling it instead "[[state capitalism]]". Those socialists who oppose any system of state control whatsoever believe in a more decentralized approach which puts the means of production directly into the hands of the workers rather than indirectly through state bureaucracies—which they claim represent a new [[elite]].

Trotskyists believe that central planners, regardless of their intellectual capacity, operate without the input and participation of the millions of people who participate in the economy who understand/respond to local conditions and changes in the economy, and because of this criticize central state planning as being unable to effectively coordinate all economic activity.&lt;ref&gt;''Writings 1932-33, P.96'', Leon Trotsky.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Orthodox Marxism|Orthodox Marxists]] view state socialism as an oxymoron. While an association for managing production and economic affairs would exist in socialism, it would no longer be a state in the Marxist definition (which is based on domination by one class). This leads some socialists to consider "state socialism" a form of state capitalism (an economy based on wage labor and capital accumulation, but with the state owning the means of production), which Engels states would be the final form of capitalism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1880/soc-utop/ch03.htm Socialism: Utopian and Scientific (Chpt. 3)]. Marxists.org. Retrieved on 12 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, many political parties on the [[left-wing politics|political center-left]] advocate a mild version of what may be considered "mixed economies" or "regulated capitalism" in the form of modern [[social democracy]], in which regulation is used in place of ownership. These social reformers do not advocate the overthrow of [[capitalism]] in a [[social revolution]] and they support the continuing existence of the government, [[private property]] and the [[Capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalist economic system]], only turned to more social purposes. Modern social democracy can also be considered "state capitalism" because the means of production are almost universally the private property of business owners and production for [[voluntary exchange]] is carried out rather than [[production for use]].{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

'''''Toolson v. New York Yankees''''', 346 U.S. 356 (1953), is a [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] case in which the Court upheld, 7–2, the [[United States antitrust law|antitrust]] exemption first granted to [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) three decades earlier in ''[[Federal Baseball Club v. National League]]''. It was also the first challenge to the [[reserve clause]] which prevented [[free agent|free agency]],&lt;ref name="McKelvey"&gt;{{cite book|title=For It's One, Two, Three, Four Strikes You're Out At The Owners' Ball Game: Players Versus Management in Baseball|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2j0tHIKuq1cC&amp;pg=PA52&amp;dq=%22George+Toolson%22|last=McKelvey|first=G.

Major league clubs would keep top talent in the minors as protection against being caught short-handed if top talent was injured. Toolson, who probably could have played for a number of other major-league teams, found himself in that situation. He believed he was being denied the opportunity to play in the majors because of the depth of the Yankees' farm system.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and one of the first cases heard and decided by the [[Warren Court]].

Since it presumed that [[United States Congress|Congress]]'s failure to act in the years since ''Federal Baseball Club'' was an implicit expression of intent to keep baseball exempt from the [[Sherman Antitrust Act]], it has been read as having done more to create that exemption than the older case. Two justices ([[Stanley Forman Reed]] and [[Harold Hitz Burton]]) dissented from the short, unsigned ''[[per curiam]]'' [[majority opinion]], arguing MLB and its revenue sources had changed enough since 1922 that the logic of that case no longer applied. In 1972, a third justice ([[William O. Douglas]]) would express his regret at having joined the majority when ''Toolson'' was again upheld in the similar ''[[Flood v. Kuhn]]''.

== Background ==
George Earl Toolson was a [[pitcher]] with the [[Newark Bears (International League)|Newark Bears]] in 1949, a [[farm system|farm team]] for the [[New York Yankees]] in the [[AAA (baseball)|AAA]]-class [[International League]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/register/player.cgi?id=toolso001geo | title=George Toolson | work=Baseball-Reference.com| accessdate=November 4, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He believed he was good enough to play in the major leagues, if not for the Yankees then for another team. But due to the [[reserve clause]] in his and every other player's contract, under which teams reserved rights to a player for a year after the contract expired, he was effectively bound to the talent-rich Yankees and could not negotiate a new contract with another team.&lt;ref name="McKelvey" /&gt;

When the Newark franchise was dissolved prior to the 1950 season, he was demoted by the Yankees' organization to the [[Binghamton Triplets]], an A-class team within its [[minor league baseball|minor league]] system.&lt;ref name="McKelvey" /&gt; He refused to report and instead filed suit, arguing the reserve clause was a [[restraint of trade]] and that baseball should not be exempt from antitrust laws.

=== Baseball antitrust exemption ===
In 1922, in an opinion by Justice [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.]], a unanimous court held in ''Federal Baseball Club'' that professional baseball did not meet the definition of [[interstate commerce]] under the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] and the Sherman Act because, although teams traveled between states from game to game, that travel was "incidental" to the business and not an essential aspect, since all the revenue was generated from the actual games.&lt;ref name="Federal Baseball Club"&gt;''Federal Baseball Club of Baltimore v. National League of Professional Baseball Clubs'', 259 U.S. 200 ''et seq''., Holmes, J.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the time Toolson filed his suit, baseball had grown greatly in popularity and as such had changed. Improved roads and public transportation meant that fans in some areas crossed state lines to attend games, and radio and television broadcasts, from which the teams derived substantial revenue, brought those games to the fans who did not leave home. The interstate aspects of the professional game had greatly increased.

In 1947, [[Commissioner of Baseball]] [[Happy Chandler]] was sued by former [[New York Giants (NL)|New York Giants]] [[outfielder]] [[Danny Gardella]], who argued that the five-year ban Chandler imposed on players who, like Gardella, had jumped briefly to the rival [[Mexican League]] was an unfair use of monopoly power and that the ''Federal Baseball Club'' decision no longer applied. A preliminary ruling in favor of the baseball commissioner was reversed by the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit|Second Circuit Court of Appeals]], returning the case to the lower court for trial. In 1949, Chandler settled with Gardella for a reported $65,000. Gardella initially sought $300,000,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Leonard |last=Koppett |authorlink=Leonard Koppett |title=Koppett Views |work=The Sporting News |page=6 |date=1970-01-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; settling for less on his lawyers' advice he would lose on appeal to the Supreme Court.

In 1951, [[Brooklyn]] [[United States House of Representatives|congressman]] [[Emanuel Celler]], an advocate for strong antitrust enforcement, had chaired a special [[United States House Committee on the Judiciary|Judiciary Committee]] subcommittee on [[monopoly power]], which had looked into baseball, among other things. It had been strongly critical, but took no action because of the pending court cases from other Mexican League players.&lt;ref name="Duquette"&gt;{{cite book|title=Regulating the National Pastime: Baseball and Antitrust|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uGiD4LrT6coC&amp;pg=PA48&amp;dq=Toolson%2BNew%2BYork%2BYankees|last=Duquette|first=Jerold J.|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|location=[[Westport, Connecticut]]|isbn=0-275-96535-X|page=48|quote=The Chairman of this subcommittee was New York Rep.

=== Trial and appeal ===
Both the [[United States District Court for the Central District of California|district court in Los Angeles]] and the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|Ninth Circuit]] relied on ''Federal Baseball Club'' in ruling for the defendants. The Supreme Court granted ''[[certiorari]]'' to hear it and consider a number of other cases by former Mexican League players pending at the appellate level.

Among the lawyers working on the case for baseball was [[Bowie Kuhn]],&lt;ref name="Kuhn"&gt;{{cite book|title=Hardball: The Education of a Baseball Commissioner|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O49P1hlaxA0C&amp;pg=PA19&amp;dq=%22George+Toolson%22|last=Kuhn|first=Bowie|authorlink=Bowie Kuhn|year=1988|publisher=[[University of Nebraska Press]] |location=[[Lincoln, Nebraska]] |isbn=0-8032-7784-9 |page=19|quote=I worked on the Toolson case during its progress through the courts, counting myself fortunate to be dealing with a matter of such crucial importance to the game.}}&lt;/ref&gt; then of the prestigious firm [[Willkie Farr &amp; Gallagher]], who would later himself become baseball commissioner and the [[Defendant|respondent]] in ''[[Flood v. Kuhn]]'', the next case to challenge the reserve clause. When the case reached the Supreme Court, the [[Boston Red Sox]] filed an ''[[amicus curiae]]'' brief in support of the Yankees, [[Yankees–Red Sox rivalry|their bitter rival]].&lt;ref name="Red Sox brief"&gt;As Boston American League Base Ball Company, the team's corporate name. 349 U.S. 356.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit|Second Circuit]], in reinstating Gardella's challenge, had called ''Federal Baseball'' "an impotent zombi" in light of recent Supreme Court antitrust decisions,&lt;ref name="impotent zombie"&gt;''Gardella v. Chandler'', 172 F.2d 402, 408-09 (1949) (Frank, J., concurring).&lt;/ref&gt; baseball did not expect the Court to rule in its favor.

== Opinion of the Court ==
A one-paragraph unsigned ''[[per curiam]]'' opinion was followed by a longer dissent by Justice [[Harold Hitz Burton]], joined by [[Stanley Forman Reed]].

=== Majority ===
After briefly restating the conclusion of ''Federal Baseball Club'', the majority continued:
{{quote|Congress has had the ruling under consideration, but has not seen fit to bring such business under these laws by legislation having prospective effect. The business has thus been left for thirty years to develop on the understanding that it was not subject to existing antitrust legislation ... [I]f there are evils in this field which now warrant application to it of the antitrust laws, it should be by legislation. Without reexamination of the underlying issues, the judgments below are affirmed ... so far as that decision determines that Congress had no intention of including the business of baseball within the scope of the federal antitrust laws.&lt;ref name="majority"&gt;''Toolson v. New York Yankees'', 346 U.S. 356, 357, ''per curiam''.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Dissent ===
Burton listed a number of aspects of contemporary baseball—the extensive farm system, broadcasting revenues, national advertising campaigns and even its reach beyond the borders of the United States—to justify his statement that "it is a contradiction in terms to say that the defendants in the cases before us are not now engaged in interstate trade or commerce as those terms are used in the Constitution of the United States and in the Sherman Act". He also cited a report by a [[United States House of Representatives|House]] subcommittee that had come to a similar conclusion.

He conceded "the major asset which baseball is to our Nation, the high place it enjoys in the hearts of our people, and the possible justification of special treatment for organized sports which are engaged in interstate trade or commerce".&lt;ref name="dissent"&gt;''Id.'', Burton J., dissenting.&lt;/ref&gt; But while it was certainly within Congress's power to repeal or specifically enact an antitrust exemption for baseball, it had not done so, "and no court has demonstrated the existence of an implied exemption from that Act of any sport that is so highly organized as to amount to an interstate monopoly or which restrains interstate trade or commerce". He concluded "The present popularity of organized baseball increases, rather than diminishes, the importance of its compliance with standards of reasonableness comparable with those now required by law of interstate trade or commerce."&lt;ref name="dissent2"&gt;''Id.'' at 364-65.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Subsequent developments ==

=== Jurisprudence ===
Within the next few terms, ''Toolson'''s logic was criticized directly and indirectly by other justices, including some  who had been in the majority, in dissents from opinions in which the Court held that it was specific to baseball and that even other professional sports weren't covered.

[[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]] [[Earl Warren]] admitted, writing for the majority two years later when denying [[boxing]] the exemption, that "this Court has never before considered the antitrust status of the boxing business. Yet, if it were not for ''Federal Baseball'' and ''Toolson'', we think that it would be too clear for dispute."&lt;ref name="Warren International Boxing"&gt;''[[United States v. International Boxing Club of New York]]'', 348 U.S. 236, 240 (1955), Warren, C.J.&lt;/ref&gt; Dissenters [[Felix Frankfurter]] and [[Sherman Minton]], who were in the ''Toolson'' majority, were harshly critical. "It would baffle the subtlest ingenuity to find a single differentiating factor between other sporting exhibitions ...and baseball insofar as the conduct of the sport is relevant to the criteria or considerations by which the Sherman Law becomes applicable to a 'trade or commerce.'", the former wrote. "I cannot translate even the narrowest conception of ''[[stare decisis]]'' into the equivalent of writing into the Sherman Law an exemption of baseball to the exclusion of every other sport different not one legal jot or tittle from it."&lt;ref name="Frankfurter International Boxing"&gt;''Id.'', 248-250, Frankfurter J., dissenting.&lt;/ref&gt; Minton, in his dissent, added:
{{quote|When boxers travel from State to State, carrying their shorts and fancy dressing robes in a ditty bag in order to participate in a boxing bout, which is wholly intrastate, it is now held by this Court that the boxing bout becomes interstate commerce. What this Court held in the ''Federal Baseball'' case to be incident to the exhibition now becomes more important than the exhibition. This is as fine an example of the tail wagging the dog as can be conjured up.&lt;ref name="Minton International Boxing"&gt;''Id.'' at 251, Minton, J., dissenting.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Another two years passed, and ''[[Radovich v. National Football League]]'' came before the Court. The circumstances of professional [[American football|football]] at the time were almost identical to those of baseball, yet the Court ruled that the antitrust exemption was specific to the latter. [[Tom C. Clark]], writing for a majority of six, defended the ''Toolson'' decision as preferable to the alternative: "[M]ore harm would be done in overruling ''Federal Baseball'' than in upholding a ruling which, at best, was of dubious validity"&lt;ref name="Radovich Clark majority"&gt;''[[Radovich v. National Football League]]'', 352 U.S. 445, 450, Clark, J.&lt;/ref&gt; and admitted "were we considering the question of baseball for the first time upon a clean slate, we would have no doubts."&lt;ref name="clean slate"&gt;''Id.'' at 452.&lt;/ref&gt;

Frankfurter again expressed his incredulity. "...[T]he most conscientious probing of the text and the interstices of the Sherman Law fails to disclose that Congress, whose will we are enforcing, excluded baseball — the conditions under which that sport is carried on — from the scope of the Sherman Law, but included football", he said.&lt;ref name="Frankfurter Radovich dissent"&gt;''Id.'' at 455, Frankfurter, J., dissenting.&lt;/ref&gt; He was joined in a separate opinion by [[John Marshall Harlan II]] signed by then-new justice [[William J. Brennan, Jr.|William Brennan]]: " I am unable to distinguish football from baseball under the rationale of ''Federal Baseball'' and ''Toolson'', and can find no basis for attributing to Congress a purpose to put baseball in a class by itself."&lt;ref name="Harlan"&gt;''Id.'' at 456, Harlan, J., dissenting.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== ''Flood v. Kuhn'' ====
{{main|Flood v. Kuhn}}
In 1970, [[St. Louis Cardinals]] star [[center fielder]] [[Curt Flood]] decided to refuse a trade to the [[Philadelphia Phillies]] and challenge the [[reserve clause]] again. Due to his stature as a player, his case attracted wide attention. It reached the Court in 1972. Although Flood lost, widespread support for his suit paved the way for [[Free agent|free agency]].

[[William O. Douglas]], who had been on the ''Toolson'' majority, had ruled in a 1971 emergency appeal from [[Haywood v. National Basketball Association|a suit]] brought by [[Spencer Haywood]] that basketball wasn't exempt, either, and suggested he was reconsidering his role in ''Toolson'': "the decision in this suit would be similar to the one on baseball's reserve clause which our decisions exempting baseball from the antitrust laws have foreclosed."&lt;ref name="Haywood v. NBA"&gt;''[[Haywood v. National Basketball Association|Haywood v. Nat'l Basketball Assn.]]'', 401 U.S. 1204, 1205, Douglas, J.&lt;/ref&gt; The following year he was the only justice from the ''Toolson'' court still sitting when ''Flood v. Kuhn'' was heard, and made his change of mind explicit in a footnote to his dissent: "While I joined the Court's opinion in ''Toolson'' ... I have lived to regret it; and I would now correct what I believe to be its fundamental error."&lt;ref name="Douglas Flood regret"&gt;''[[Flood v. Kuhn]]'', 407 U.S. 258, 286n1, Douglas, J., dissenting.&lt;/ref&gt;

In that case's [[majority opinion]], [[Harry Blackmun]] conceded that the facts no longer supported the exemption and that baseball was indeed [[interstate commerce]],&lt;ref name="Blackmun"&gt;''Id.'', at 282-284, Blackmun, J.&lt;/ref&gt; but echoed Clark in suggesting that the consequences of overturning the previous decisions would be worse than letting it stand. Chief Justice [[Warren Burger]] agreed in a short concurrence that also indicated his acceptance of Douglas's regret.&lt;ref name="Burger"&gt;''Id.'' at 285-86, Burger, C.J., concurring.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Legal analysis and criticism ===
Sports business historian Andrew Zimbalist attributes the unexpected outcome to "a game of cat and mouse" between Congress and the Court:
{{quote|The Congress did not pass a bill lifting baseball's exemption because it thought it had already been lifted by the 1948 ''Gardella'' decision. The Supreme Court affirmed the Holmes decision because it thought Congress had given its sanction to the exemption by not passing new legislation in 1951.&lt;ref name="Zimbalist"&gt;{{cite book|title=May The Best Team Win: Baseball Economics and Public Policy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aX-GBXLQN-QC&amp;pg=PA19&amp;dq=Toolson%2BYankees%2Bcat%2Bmouse|last=Zimbalist|first =Andrew S.|publisher=[[Brookings Institution]] Press|location=Washington, D.C.|year=2004|isbn=0-8157-9728-1|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Much of the criticism of ''Toolson'' over the years has viewed it as the middle term of the sequence that begins with ''Federal Baseball Club'' and ends with ''Flood'', and considers it in that context. Its embrace of ''[[stare decisis]]'' and presumption of congressional inaction as a justification, is notably at odds with the position&lt;ref name="Tsimpris"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tismpris |first=William |date=Summer 2004 |title=A Question of (Anti)trust: Flood v. Kuhn and the Viability of Major League Baseball's Antitrust Exemption |journal=Richmond Journal of Law and the Public Interest |volume=8 |issue=1 |pages=69–86 |id= |url=http://law.richmond.edu/rjolpi/Issues_Archived/2004_Summer_Issue/Article_6_Tsimpris.pdf |accessdate=2008-02-27 |quote=Indeed, prior to ''Toolson'', the Court had expressed skepticism of basing its decision on congressional inaction. For instance, in ''Helvering v. Hallock'' the Court discussed stare decisis with regard to statutory interpretation ... |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060908035325/http://law.richmond.edu/rjolpi/Issues_Archived/2004_Summer_Issue/Article_6_Tsimpris.pdf |archivedate=September 8, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that Justice [[Felix Frankfurter]] took when writing for the Court in a 1940 trust-law case, ''[[Helvering v. Hallock]]'', where prior flawed decisions had not been corrected through legislative action, that "it would require very persuasive circumstances enveloping Congressional silence to debar this Court from re-examining its own doctrines"&lt;ref name="Helvering"&gt;''Helvering v. Hallock'', {{ussc|309|106|1940}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

One critic, antitrust expert Kevin McDonald of [[Jones Day]], singles out the 1953 case for having truly created the antitrust exemption by reading congressional intent into Holmes' original opinion. After quoting the ''per curiam'''s closing sentence, he writes:
{{quote|With that baseless assertion, the baseball exemption was born. As we have seen, ''Federal Baseball'' said nothing about the Congress of 1890 intentionally excluding baseball from the Sherman Act. It is as if the majority in ''Toolson'' imagined [[John Sherman (politician)|Senator Sherman]] announcing that "today we enact the Magna Carta of the working class so that all American business will respect the right of consumers to free and open competition ... that is, um, except for organized baseball, of course." Indeed, what did it mean to affirm ''Federal Baseball'' "so far as that decision determines that Congress had no intention of including ... baseball within the ... antitrust laws", when ''Federal Baseball'' said no such thing?&lt;ref name="McDonald"&gt;McDonald, Kevin D.; [http://www.abanet.org/antitrust/at-source/05/09/Sep05-McDonald9=27.pdf There's No Tying in Baseball: On ''Illinois Tool'' and the Presumption of Market Power in Patent Tying Cases]; September 2005; antitrustsource.com; 7 retrieved March 4, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Lower courts, he said, took the court's reasoning to mean that other professional team sports were also exempt, forcing the justices to clarify that it only applied to baseball, and criticize their earlier ruling, in order to sustain decisions that football and boxing were interstate commerce and within the scope of antitrust law.&lt;ref name="McDonald8"&gt;''Ibid.'', 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Effect on baseball ===
Toolson's career was over, and MLB resumed its ''[[Status quo ante bellum|status quo ante]]''. But the underlying issues remained, and a decade later began to be addressed when players unionized as the [[Major League Baseball Players Association]], with free agency one of many goals.

[[1965 in baseball|Two years later]], baseball held its first amateur [[draft (sports)|draft]], ending the system whereby wealthier and successful teams like the Yankees were able to keep their farm teams stocked with talent the way they had with Toolson, not only as insurance against player injuries but to prevent opposing teams from signing them.&lt;ref name="Chadwin"&gt;{{cite book|title=Those Damn Yankees: The Secret Life of America's Greatest Franchise|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Que1GhWOf68C&amp;pg=PA109&amp;dq=Toolson%2BYankees%2BNCAA|last=Chadwin|first=Dean|publisher=Verso|location=Brooklyn, New York|year=2000|isbn=1-85984-283-6|page=109|quote=The reserve system has always been justified by the owners as necessary to maintain competitive balance. In fact it has enabled the best teams to squirrel away talented players in the minors where they can serve as insurance in case of injury, and more importantly be kept off the rosters of potential rivals}}&lt;/ref&gt; That ended the continuous domination of the Yankees.

Despite legal and judicial criticism and embarrassment, baseball's antitrust exemption remains in effect. Players in the major leagues won free agency with the [[Seitz decision]] in 1975, and the 1998 Curt Flood Act gave major league players, but not others involved in baseball, rights under the antitrust laws.&lt;ref&gt;Pub. L. 105-297, 112 Stat. 2824&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-105publ297/pdf/PLAW-105publ297.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  But for players in the minor leagues, like Toolson, the reserve system persists, and they are still bound to the organization that initially signed them.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5979"> {{missing information|why the UCITA is so controversial and opposed by many|date=July 2018}}
'''''Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act'' (UCITA)''' was an attempt to introduce a [[Uniform Act]] for US States to follow. As a ''model law'', it only specifies a set of guidelines, and each of the States should decide if to pass it or not, separately. UCITA has been drafted by [[National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws]] (NCCUSL).&lt;ref name="jamesshuggins"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jamesshuggins.com/h/tek1/ucita.htm |title=UCITA: Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act |website=James S. Huggins' Refrigerator Door |last=Huggins |first=James S. |date=October 25, 2002 |accessdate=June 8, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

UCITA has been designed to clarify issues which were not addressed by existing Uniform Commercial Code. "Few disagree that the current Uniform Commercial Code is ill-suited for use with licensing and other intangible transactions," said practicing attorney Alan Fisch.&lt;ref name="computerworld"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.computerworld.com/governmenttopics/government/legislation/story/0,10801,83870,00.html |title=Sponsor's surrender won't end UCITA battle |website=[[Computerworld]] |last=Thibodeau |first=Patrick |date=August 11, 2003 |accessdate=June 8, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

UCITA has faced severe opposition from various groups.&lt;ref name="gnu"&gt;{{cite web

UCITA has only been passed in two states, [[Virginia]] and [[Maryland]]. The law did not pass in other states.&lt;ref name="computerworld"/&gt; Nevertheless, legal scholars, such as noted commercial law professor Jean Braucher, believe that the UCITA offers academic value.&lt;ref name="computerworld"/&gt;

A resolution recommending approval of UCITA by the [[American Bar Association]] (ABA) has been withdrawn by the NCCUSL in 2003, indicating that UCITA lacks the consensus which is necessary for it to become a [[uniform act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://lwn.net/Articles/22575/ |title=UCITA withdrawn from the ABA |website=[[LWN.net]] |author=&lt;!--Not clear who the author is--&gt; |date=February 12, 2003 |accessdate=June 8, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Provisions==
UCITA focuses on adapting current commercial trade laws to the modern software era. It is particularly controversial in terms of computer software. The code would automatically make a software maker liable for defects and errors in the program. However, it allows a [[shrinkwrap license]] to override any of UCITA's provisions. As a result, commercial software makers can include such a license in the box and not be liable for errors in the software. Free software that is normally distributed through downloads, however, would not be able to force a shrinkwrap license and would therefore be liable for errors. Small software makers without legal knowledge would also be at risk.&lt;ref name=gnu/&gt;

UCITA would explicitly allow software makers to make any legal restrictions they want on their software by calling the software a license in the [[EULA]], rather than a sale. This would therefore take away purchasers right to resell used software under the [[first sale doctrine]]. Without UCITA, courts have often ruled that despite the EULA claiming a license, the actual actions by the software company and purchaser clearly shows it was a purchase, meaning that the purchaser has the right to resell the software to anyone.

==History==
UCITA started as an attempt to modify the [[Uniform Commercial Code]] by introducing a new article: Article 2B (also known as UCC2B).&lt;ref name="jamesshuggins" /&gt;
The committee for drafting UCC2B consisted of members from both the NCCUSL and the [[American Law Institute]] (ALI). At a certain stage of the process, ALI withdrew from the drafting process, effectively killing UCC2B. Afterwards, the NCCUSL renamed UCC2B into UCITA and proceeded on its own.&lt;ref name="jamesshuggins" /&gt;

==Passage Record==
Before ratification, each state may amend its practices, thus creating different conditions in each state. This means that the final "as read" UCITA document is what is actually passed and signed into law by each state governor.  The passage record typically indicates each version of UCITA submitted for ratification.

Two states, Virginia and Maryland, passed UCITA in 2000, shortly after its completion by the NCCUSL in 1999.  However, beginning with Iowa that same year, numerous additional states have passed so-called [[UCITA bomb-shelter|"bomb-shelter"]] laws enabling citizen protections against UCITA-like provisions.

}}'''''Unifund Assurance Co v Insurance Corp of British Columbia''''', [2003] 2 S.C.R. 63, 2003 SCC 40 is a leading [[Constitution of Canada|constitutional]] decision of the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] on extraterritorial application of provincial legislation.

==Background==
Marcia and Ronald Brennan were from Ontario. They visited British Columbia and rented a car. They were in a serious accident. The plaintiff driver returned to Ontario to collect a provincial no-fault benefit from Unifund Assurance. Unifund sought reimbursement from the Insurance Corp of British Columbia under the Ontario law. The BC insurance company challenged the Ontario law as extraterritorial. 

The issue before the Supreme Court was whether s. 275 of the Ontario Insurance Act was constitutionally inapplicable in the circumstances. 

==Decision of the Court==
Justice Binnie, writing for the majority, allowed the appeal and found that the Ontario law was inapplicable to the BC insurance company. Binnie described the issue as whether there was a "[[real and substantial connection]]" between a provincial law and an out-of-province defendant. This is a question of constitutional applicability for which Binnie gives four propositions (para. 54):
#The territorial limits on the scope of provincial legislative authority prevent the application of the law of a province to matters not sufficiently connected to it;
#What constitutes a “sufficient” connection depends on the relationship among the enacting jurisdiction, the subject matter of the legislation and the individual or entity sought to be regulated by it;
#The applicability of an otherwise competent provincial legislation to out-of-province defendants is conditioned by the requirements of order and fairness that underlie our federal arrangements;
#The principles of order and fairness, being purposive, are applied flexibly according to the subject matter of the legislation.

Binnie examines and applies these principles. He notes that the BC insurance co. does not carry on any business in Ontario. He finally concludes that the Ontario law is inapplicable.

The analysis is significant in that it imports the conflict of laws approach in ''[[Morguard v De Savoye]]'' into the constitutional analysis from the [[Churchill Falls case|''Churchill Falls'' case]] and other extraterritorial cases.

The '''2009 referendum''' was a vote in which the citizens of Venezuela approved '''Amendment No. 1''' (''Enmienda No. 1'') of the [[Constitution of Venezuela]]; this abolished [[term limit]]s for the offices of [[President of Venezuela|President]], [[List of Governors of States of Venezuela|state governors]], [[mayors]] and [[National Assembly of Venezuela|National Assembly]] [[Deputy (legislator)|deputies]].

The current constitution, enacted in 1999 by [[referendum]], previously established a  three-term limit for deputies and a two-term limit for the other offices. The proposed [[constitutional amendment|amendment]] was put to a referendum on 15 February 2009&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.radiomundial.com.ve/yvke/noticia.php?t=15526&amp;imprimir=1 |title=Chávez autoriza acciones para introducir reelección presidencial a través de una enmienda |publisher=YVKE Mundial |date=20 November 2008 |accessdate=30 November 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717071536/http://www.radiomundial.com.ve/yvke/noticia.php?t=15526&amp;imprimir=1 |archive-date=17 July 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and endorsed by 54% of the electorate, with approximately 70% of registered voters participating.&lt;ref name="BBC 16/2"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7891856.stm |title=Venezuelan leader wins key reform |publisher=[[BBC News]] |date=16 February 2009 |accessdate=16 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
A proposal for an important change in the main structure of the Constitution, that included abolishing presidential term limits among major social, economical and political changes was [[Venezuelan constitutional referendum, 2007|rejected in 2007]] when university students led protests and played a critical role in the result;&lt;ref name=ObamaMeddles&gt;{{cite news |last=Jones |first=Rachel |date=17 January 2009 |title=Chavez: Obama meddles in Venezuela term-limit vote |url=http://siouxcityjournal.com/news/chavez-obama-meddles-in-venezuela-term-limit-vote/article_51acfef2-e074-586d-b8d5-a24f31f219ba.html |newspaper= |agency=Associated Press |access-date=15 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[List of Presidents of Venezuela|President]] [[Hugo Chávez]] had said the reform was needed to implement his [[socialism|socialist]] program.

On 30 November 2008, six days after [[Venezuelan regional elections, 2008|regional elections]], Hugo Chávez announced on television that he would be open to a new wave of discussion on the proposal for allowing the postulation without limits to presidential candidature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7757784.stm|title= Chavez announces re-election plan|last=Grant|first=Will|date=30 November 2008|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=14 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following day, his supporters started working towards a constitutional amendment for this goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=44934|title=Venezuela: Reviving the Debate on Presidential Reelection|last=Márquez|first=Humberto|date=1 December 2008|publisher=IPS|accessdate=14 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Provisions of the amendment==
The full title of the law was '''Amendment No. 1 of the Constitution of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela''' (''Enmienda No. 1 de la Constitucion de Republica Bolivariana de Venezuela''). It was approved by a majority of the members of the [[National Assembly of Venezuela|National Assembly]]. The [[United Socialist Party of Venezuela]] (Chávez's political party) states that the initiative was backed by more than six million people.&lt;ref&gt;{{es icon}} [http://www.psuv.org.ve/?q=node/2377 6.6 millones de firmas respaldan la propuesta de enmienda constitucional.] Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela (16 January 2009).

Article 341 of the constitution, which governs amendments, states that "amendments shall be numbered consecutively and shall be published beneath the Constitution without altering the text of the latter". Therefore, the 2009 amendment has not altered the original text of the constitution. Rather, Amendment No.1 (including new texts for each of the five amended articles) is published below the original text as a [[wikt:codicil|codicil]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://es.wikisource.org/wiki/Constituci%C3%B3n_venezolana_de_1999 Full text of the Constitution of Venezuela with Amendment No. 1] (Spanish)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reaction==
{{Unbalanced section|date=August 2010}}

===Opposition===
The initial reaction of the opposition to the referendum proposal was that it was illegal. Henry Ramos, secretary general of the opposition party [[Acción Democrática]] called the proposal " 'illegal and unconstitutional' because Article 345 says that 'A revised constitutional reform initiative may not be submitted during the same constitutional term of office of the National Assembly.' "&lt;ref name="LAHT"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.laht.com/article.asp?ArticleId=321963&amp;CategoryId=10718|title=Venezuela's Chávez Pushes For Indefinite Rule Again|last=Morgan|first=Jeremy|author2=Russ Dallen |publisher=Latin American Herald Tribune|accessdate=14 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chávez avoided this issue by declaring that the change to the constitution would be in the form of an amendment, instead of a constitutional reform. In addition, the constitutional amendment was re-defined to apply to all popular elected positions, not just to the president. Elenis Rodríguez Martínez, a leader of the opposition party [[Primero Justicia]], stated that the proposed change constitutes a fundamental change to the constitution, and therefore cannot be voted as an amendment.&lt;ref name="11 December 2008"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://buscador.eluniversal.com/2008/12/11/en_pol_esp_opposition-party-ask_11A2165127.shtml|title=Opposition party asks top court to stop amendment on endless reelection|last=Alonso|first=Juan Francisco|author2=Translated by Gerardo Cárdenas |accessdate=15 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; She stated that, "Under Article 340, 'the purpose of an amendment is to add to or modify one or more articles of the Constitution, without altering the fundamental structure of the same.' When the president says that he wants to delete some words from Article 230 of the Constitution, he is lying, because he really wants to remove an essential part of the text and in doing so he is altering its structure, as well as part of the provisions of Article 6, which reads that 'the government of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela is ... alternating' (...) This is a camouflaged reform."&lt;ref name="11 December 2008"/&gt; However, the [[Supreme Tribunal of Justice (Venezuela)|Constitutional Court]] ruled that such a change was within the scope of a constitutional amendment, and that such an amendment could be re-attempted each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.eluniversal.com/2009/02/04/pol_art_presidente-puede-pre_1255207.shtml|title=Presidente puede presentar enmiendas todos los años|last=Martínez|first=Eugenio G.|date=4 February 2009|work=El Universal|accessdate=14 February 2009|language=es}}; partial translation (4 February)[http://english.eluniversal.com/2009/02/06/en_ing_esp_chavez-hints-constit_06A2217105.shtml]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.embavenez-us.org/factsheet/FS-Amend-F4-Eng.pdf |format=PDF |title=Fact Sheet: Constitutional Amendment in Venezuela |publisher=Embajada de la República Bolivariana de Venezuela en Estados Unidos |accessdate=14 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The editors of Venezuelan publishing house ''Veneconomy'' argue that the 15 February date is too soon to comply with time-frames set forth by the suffrage law and related laws for the registration of voters newly-turned-18 and for the organization of polling stations.&lt;ref name="veneconomy"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.laht.com/article.asp?CategoryId=13303&amp;ArticleId=323251|title=Veneconomy: Venezuela Chavez' Doubly Illegal and Unconstitutional Amendment|last=editors of Veneconomy|accessdate=14 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Caracasvenezuelaprotest.jpg|thumb|left|Students protesting against the referendum. Caracas, Venezuela; 19 January 2009]]

Students again took a leading role in protests, as they did in the campaign against the 2007 referendum. On 16 January students blocked a Caracas highway, burned trees and taunted the police. After viewing video of the protests, Chávez gave the order: "Throw lots of (tear) gas at them, and take them prisoner for me. If you don't, I'm going to go after the authorities responsible."&lt;ref name=ObamaMeddles/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2009/01/18/news/LT-Venezuela-Referendum.php&lt;/ref&gt; Tensions rose in advance of the referendum, with a group of 40 armed men taking over the Caracas city hall, to which an opposition mayor had been elected in November, and declaring the building "recovered for the revolution". Tear gas was also thrown at the compound of the papal nuncio, who had granted asylum to an anti-Chávez student leader accused of sexual assault; and an anti-Chávez student leader's car was burned.&lt;ref name=TensionsBuild&gt;Kraul, Chris (20 January 2009).

Retrieved 20 January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Opposition figures have accused Chávez of using all the resources of the government to support the Yes campaign, ranging from near-total support for the Yes campaign on state radio and television to placement of Yes campaign ads on official ministry websites. According to opposition figure [[Leopoldo López]], "we aren’t competing against a political party, we’re competing against an entire state and all of the power it can wield".&lt;ref&gt;Bloomberg, 11 February 2009, [https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601086&amp;sid=aCpAy_lcxeiY&amp;refer=latin_america Chavez Puts Venezuelan Government Behind Bid to Stay in Power]&lt;/ref&gt; The opposition also says that No campaign ads have had their approval delayed and scheduling manipulated by the [[National Electoral Council (Venezuela)|National Electoral Council]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/francisco-toro/chavezs-all-out-push-to-b_b_164826.html |title=Francisco Toro: Chavez's All Out Push to be President for Life |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |date=9 February 2009 |accessdate=16 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===International===
Following claims that US officials had met with Venezuelan opposition leaders in Puerto Rico (which the US denied),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.laht.com/article.asp?ArticleId=325470&amp;CategoryId=10717 |title=Latin American Herald Tribune - U.S. Embassy Head Denies Plotting With Opposition in Venezuela |publisher=Laht.com |accessdate=16 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chávez accused U.S. President [[Barack Obama]] of meddling in the referendum, adding that "He's said I'm an obstacle for progress in Latin America... Therefore it must be removed, this obstacle, right?" Chávez also added that Obama was under pressure from the Pentagon to be tough on Venezuela by quoting: "He [Obama] knows that if he doesn't obey the orders of the empire, they'll probably kill him."&lt;ref name=ObamaMeddles /&gt;

[[President of Brazil]] [[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva]] backed Hugo Chávez's proposal of a possible re-election and asked why nobody criticized Colombian President [[Álvaro Uribe]], who was also proposing the removal of Colombia's current two-term limit,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Luigino Bracci |url=http://www.radiomundial.com.ve/yvke/noticia.php?t=17884&amp;highlight=enmienda |title=Lula respalda una futura reelección de Hugo Chávez :: YVKE Mundial |publisher=Radiomundial.com.ve |accessdate=16 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; having already removed the previous one-term limit, a move that made possible his re-election in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldpoliticsreview.com/article.aspx?id=3255 |title=Third Term for Uribe Threatens Colombian Democracy |publisher=World Politics Review |date=5 February 2009 |accessdate=16 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 February 2009, the Venezuelan government expelled [[Luis Herrero-Tejedor Algar|Luis Herrero]], a Spanish member of the [[European Parliament]] (and member of the [[European People's Party]]), after he called Chávez a [[dictator]] and criticized Chávez's handling of the constitutional referendum.
