The proponents arguing for anti-individualism in these areas have in common the view that what seems to be internal to the individual is to some degree dependent on the [[social environment]], thus self-knowledge, intentions, [[reason]]ing and [[Value theory|moral value]] may variously be seen as being determined by factors outside the person.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Jessica: 2004, ''Anti-Individualism and Knowledge''. MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The position has been supported by Sanford Goldberg&lt;ref&gt;Goldberg, Sanford (2007). ''Anti-individualism: mind and language, knowledge and justification''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and by other thinkers such as [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]], [[Hilary Putnam]] and [[Tyler Burge]].&lt;ref name=burge/&gt;

== Overview ==
Academic discussion negotiating anti-individualism as a reasonable stance started with [[Tyler Burge]]'s 1988 ''Individuation and Self-Knowledge''&lt;ref name=Burge2&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burge|first1=Tyler|title=Individuation and Self-Knowledge|journal=The Journal of Philosophy|date=November 1988|volume=85|issue=11|pages=649–663|url=http://isites.harvard.edu/fs/docs/icb.topic1007312.files/Week%2013/burge%20individualism.pdf|accessdate=26 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; being particularly influential. In it, Burge set out to argue for a limited agreement with the Cartesian model of self-cognition as being Authoritative, but also pointed out that knowledge of self-cognition was not always absolute, allowing for the individuation of thought to originate from both the external content of our environment as well as from the internal landscape of our self-knowledge as it is still being discovered: "One can know what one's mental events are and yet not know relevant general facts about the conditions for  individuating those events. It is simply not true that the cogito gives us knowledge of the individuation conditions of our thoughts which enables us to "shut off" their individuation conditions  from the physical environment".&lt;ref name=Burge2/&gt;

Michael McKinsey builds on this in 1991 discussing Burge's view in his paper ''Anti-Individualism and Privileged Access''&lt;ref name=Mckinsey/&gt; arguing that there is no [[Theory of justification|warrant]] to an [[Epistemology|epistemic]] narrow state of mind (i.e. privileged access) and that there is only a wide state of mind as influenced by the conditions of individuation of thought. Anthony Brueckner then questions McKinsey's take on Burge and McKinsey replies in his ''Accepting the Consequences of Anti-individualism''.&lt;ref name=McKinsey2&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McKinsey|first1=Michael|title=Accepting the Consequences of Anti-individualism|journal=Analysis|date=April 1994|volume=54|issue=2|pages=124–128|url=https://www.academia.edu/8199013/Accepting_the_Consequences_of_Anti-Indiividualism|accessdate=26 December 2014|doi=10.2307/3328832 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the essays found in Hilary Putnam's ''The Twin Earth Chronicles'' are considered early formative works for the anti-individualist model from the analytic perspective.&lt;ref name=Putnam&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hilary|first1=Putnam|title=The Twin Earth Chronicles: Twenty Years of Reflection on Hilary Putnam's "The Meaning of 'Meaning'"|date=1 July 1996|publisher=M.E.

[http://www.behavior.org/resource.php?id=330 "Introduction to Behavioral Safety"] Cambridge Center for Behavior Studies.&lt;/ref&gt; or "A process that creates a safety partnership between management and employees that continually focuses people's attentions and actions on theirs, and others, daily safety behavior."&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, MD (2009).

'''15''' (12, 01 Oct) p. 66&lt;/ref&gt; At its very core BBS is based on a larger scientific field called [[organizational behavior management]].{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

In a safety management system based upon the [[hierarchy of hazard control]], BBS may be applied to internalise hazard avoidance strategies or [[administrative controls]] (including use of [[personal protective equipment]]), but should not be used in preference to the implementation of reasonably practicable safety measures further up the hierarchy.

To be successful a BBS program must include all employees, from the CEO to the front line workers including hourly, salary, union employees, contractors and sub-contractors. To achieve changes in behavior, a change in policy, procedures and/or systems most assuredly will also need some change. Those changes cannot be done without buy-in and support from all involved in making those decisions.

BBS is not based on assumptions, personal feeling, and/or [[common knowledge]]. To be successful, the BBS program used must be based on [[scientific knowledge]].

'''Blood money''', also called '''bloodwit''', is money or some sort of compensation paid by an offender (usually a murderer) or his/her family group to the family or kin group of the victim.&lt;ref name="britannica"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/blood-money-sociology |title=blood money &amp;#124; sociology &amp;#124; Britannica.com|author=The Editors of Encyclopædia Britannica|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=30 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Particular examples and uses==
Blood money is, colloquially, the reward for bringing a criminal to justice. A common meaning in other contexts is the money-penalty paid by a murderer to the kinsfolk of the victim. These fines completely protect the offender (or the kinsfolk thereof) from the vengeance of the injured family. The system was common among [[Germanic peoples]] before the introduction of [[Christianity]] ([[weregild]]), and a scale of payments, graduated according to the heinousness of the crime, was fixed by laws, which further settled who could exact the blood-money, and who were entitled to share it. Homicide was not the only crime thus expiable: blood-money could be exacted for all crimes of violence. Some acts, such as killing someone in a church or while asleep, or within the precincts of the royal palace, were "bot-less"; and the death penalty was inflicted. Such a criminal was outlawed, and could be killed on sight.&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Blood-Money|volume=4|page=85}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Islam===
{{main|Qisas|Diyya}}
In Islamic terms, Qisas can in some cases result in blood money being paid out to the family of victims. The amount varies from country to country and from case to case.

===In Judaism===
As a person's life is considered as being the property of God, Judaism forbids the taking of blood-money for the life of a murdered victim.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/3409-blood-money&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Japan===
In Japanese culture it is common to give blood money or ''mimaikin'' to a victim's family.  Such was the case with [[Lucie Blackman]]'s father who accepted £450,000 as blood money for the murder of his daughter.&lt;ref name="name"&gt;{{cite web |date=2007-04-20|url = http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/news/article-23393379-details/Lucie%27s%20father%20%27helped%20killer%20by%20accepting%20blood%20money%27/article.do|title = Lucie's father 'helped killer by accepting blood money'|publisher = This is London Magazine Ltd| accessdate = 2009-03-20 | last= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Korea===
Under the Korean legal system, it is common for those accused of both minor (such as defamation) and serious crimes (such as rape) to offer blood money (''hapuigeum'', 합의금) to the victim, and if accepted then the perpetrator is usually excused further punishment.  It is often brokered by the police.&lt;ref&gt;Adam Walsh [http://www.koreaherald.com/lifestyle/Detail.jsp?newsMLId=20090812000108], "Korea Herald", March 30, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lyse Comins {{cite web|url=http://www.womensnet.org.za/news/rapist-increases-blood-money-offer |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-10-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721084533/http://www.womensnet.org.za/news/rapist-increases-blood-money-offer |archivedate=2011-07-21 |df= }}, "Daily News", October 6, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite being common practice, its use in high-profile cases does sometimes result in protests.&lt;ref&gt;Son Jun-hyun [http://english.hani.co.kr/arti/english_edition/e_national/451375.html], "The Hankyoreh", November 30, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Somalia===
In the [[Somali people]]'s [[customary law]], which they call ''[[Xeer]]'' (a [[polycentric law|polycentric]] legal system developed indigenously), blood money is issued in the event of libel, theft, physical harm, rape and death, as well as to supply assistance to relatives of the injured party.&lt;ref name="SJS"&gt;

==Other meanings or uses==

===In Christianity===
In the Christian [[Bible]], the term is used to refer to the [[thirty pieces of silver]] [[Judas Iscariot]] received in exchange for revealing the identity of [[Jesus Christ]] to the forces sent by the [[Pharisees]] and/or the [[Sanhedrin]]. After the [[crucifixion]] of Christ, Judas returned the payment to the chief priests, who “took the silver pieces and said, ‘It is not lawful for to put them into the treasury, because it is the price of blood.’” &lt;ref&gt;Matthew 27:6&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In shipping ===
"[[Shanghaiing]]" was the practice of the forced conscription of [[sailor]]s.  Boarding masters, whose job it was to find crews for ships, were paid "by the body," and thus had a strong incentive to place as many seamen on ships as possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hope |first=Ronald | title= Poor Jack: The Perilous History of the Merchant Seaman |year=2001 |publisher= Greenhill Books|location= London|isbn=1-86176-161-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sup1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sailors.org/pdf/history1-2.pdf |title=The Lookout of the Labor Movement |accessdate=2007-04-02 |work=Sailors Union of the Pacific |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030512184317/http://www.sailors.org/pdf/history1-2.pdf |archivedate=2003-05-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This pay was called blood money.&lt;ref name="smith"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.shapingsf.org/ezine/labor/shanghai/main.html|title=About That Blood in the Scuppers |accessdate=2007-04-03 |author=Georgia Smith |date= |year=1988  |work= Reclaiming San Francisco: History Politics and Culture, a City Lights Anthology |publisher=City Lights |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061011111827/http://www.shapingsf.org/ezine/labor/shanghai/main.html |archivedate = 2006-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="39776">'''Child discipline''' is the methods used to prevent future behavioral problems in children. The word discipline is defined as imparting knowledge and skill, in other words, to teach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |publisher=Canadian Paediatric Society |title= Effective discipline for children |journal= Paediatrics &amp; Child Health |volume= 9 |issue= 1 |pages= 37–41 |pmc= 2719514|year= 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In its most general sense, [[discipline]] refers to systematic instruction given to a disciple. ''To discipline'' means to instruct a person to follow a particular code of conduct.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last= Papalia|first=D.E. |last2=Wendkos-Olds |first2=S. |last3= Duskin-Feldman |first3=R. |year=2006 |title=A Child's World: Infancy Through Adolescence |edition=10th |location=New York |publisher=McGraw-Hill}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Discipline is used by parents to teach their children about expectations, guidelines and principles. Children need to be given regular discipline to be taught right from wrong and to be maintained safe. Child discipline can involve rewards and punishments to teach self-control, increase desirable behaviors and decrease undesirable behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Smenyak |first=Sarah |title=The difference between discipline and child abuse |url= http://www.livestrong.com/article/69111-difference-between-discipline-child/ |publisher=Demand Media |accessdate=29 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the purpose of child discipline is to develop and entrench desirable social [[Habituation|habits]] in children, the ultimate goal is to foster sound judgement and [[morality|morals]] so the child develops and maintains self-discipline throughout the rest of his/her life.

Because the values, beliefs, education, customs and [[culture]]s of people vary so widely, along with the age and temperament of the child, methods of child discipline vary widely.  Child discipline is a topic that draws from a wide range of interested fields, such as [[parenting]], the professional practice of [[behavior analysis]], [[developmental psychology]], [[social work]], and various [[religion|religious perspectives]].  In recent years, advances in the understanding of [[attachment parenting]] have provided a new background of theoretical understanding and advanced clinical and practical understanding of the effectiveness and outcome of parenting methods.

In Western society, there has been debate in recent years over the use of [[Corporal punishment in the home|corporal punishment]] for [[child]]ren in general, and increased attention to the concept of "positive parenting" where good behavior is encouraged and rewarded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nspcc.org.uk/HelpAndAdvice/Publications/Leaflets/encouraging_pdf_wdf36202.pdf |title=Encouraging better behavior - A practical guide to positive parenting |publisher=[[NSPCC]] |year=2003 |accessdate=25 March 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014154404/http://www.nspcc.org.uk/helpandadvice/publications/leaflets/encouraging_pdf_wdf36202.pdf |archivedate=October 14, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Consistency, firmness and respect are all important components of [[positive discipline]]. The goal of positive discipline is to teach, train and guide children so that they learn, practice self-control and develop the ability to manage their emotions, and make wise choices regarding their personal behavior. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://msue.anr.msu.edu/news/positive_discipline_punishment_vs_discipline|title=Positive discipline: Punishment vs. discipline|work=MSU Extension|access-date=2018-09-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Historical research suggests that there has been a great deal of individual variation in methods of discipline over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Pollock |first=Linda A. |title= Forgotten children: parent-child relations from 1500 to 1900 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |url= https://books.google.com/?id=JYR4nxXWIjMC&amp;pg=PA143&amp;lpg=PA143&amp;dq=18th+century+child+discipline&amp;q=18th%20century%20child%20discipline |year=1983 |isbn=0-521-25009-9 |chapter=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medieval times===
Nicholas Orme of the University of Exeter argues that children in medieval times were treated differently from adults in legal matters, and the authorities were as troubled about violence to children as they were to adults. In his article, "Childhood in Medieval England," he states, "Corporal punishment was in use throughout society and probably also in homes, although social commentators criticized parents for indulgence towards children rather than for harsh discipline." Salvation was the main goal of discipline, and parents were driven to ensure their children a place in heaven.&lt;ref name="fleming"&gt;{{cite web |last=Fleming |first=Sandy |title=How has child discipline changed?|url= http://www.livestrong.com/article/31506-child-discipline-changed/ |publisher=Demand Media |accessdate=29 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one incident in early 14th-century London, neighbors intervened when a cook and clerk were beating a boy carrying water. A scuffle ensued and the child's tormentors were subdued. The neighbors didn't even know the boy, but they firmly stood up for him even when they were physically attacked, and they stood by their actions when the cook and clerk later sued for damages.&lt;ref&gt;Hanawalt, Barbara, ''Growing Up in Medieval London'' (Oxford University Press, 1993), p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Colonial times===
During colonial times in the United States, parents were able to provide enjoyments for their children in the form of toys, according to David Robinson, writer for the ''Colonial Williamsburg Journal''. Robinson notes that even the Puritans permitted their young children to play freely. Older children were expected to swiftly adopt adult chores and accountabilities, to meet the strict necessities of daily life.&lt;ref name="fleming"/&gt;  Harsh punishments for minor infractions were common. Beatings and other forms of corporal punishment occurred regularly; one legislator even suggested capital punishment for children's misbehavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED252451|title=ERIC - Student Discipline in Colonial America., 1984-Nov|work=ed.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Biblical views ===
The [[Book of Proverbs]] mentions the importance of disciplining children, as opposed to leaving them neglected or unruly, in several verses. Interpretation of these verses varies, as do many passages from the Bible, from literal to metaphorical. The most often paraphrased is from Proverbs 13:24, "He that spareth his [[switch (rod)|rod]] hateth his son: but he that loveth him chasteneth him betimes." ([[King James Version]].) Other passages that mention the 'rod' are Proverbs 23:14, "Thou shalt beat him with the rod, and shalt deliver his soul from hell," and Proverbs 29:15, "The rod and reproof give wisdom: but a child left to himself bringeth his mother to shame."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.learnthebible.org/eight-misconceptions-about-spanking.html |title= Eight Misconceptions About Spanking  |publisher=Learn The Bible |accessdate=19 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the Bible's lessons have been paraphrased for hundreds of years, the modern phrase, "Spare the rod and spoil the child," was coined by [[Samuel Butler (poet)|Samuel Butler]], in ''[[Hudibras]]'', a [[mock heroic]] [[narrative poem]] published in 1663. The [[Contemporary English Version]] of Proverbs 13:24 is: 'If you love your children you will correct them; if you don't love them, you won't correct them'.

=== Medieval views ===
[[Image:Koerperstrafe- MA Birkenrute.png|thumb|280px|Medieval schoolboy birched on the bare buttocks]]
The primary guidelines followed by medieval parents in training their children were from the Bible. Scolding was considered ineffectual, and cursing a child was a terrible thing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hanawalt |first=Barbara |title= The Ties that Bound: Peasant Families in Medieval England |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1986 |page=182}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, the use of corporal punishment was as a disciplinary action taken to shape behavior, not a pervasive dispensing of beatings for no reason. Corporal punishment was undoubtedly the norm.  The medieval world was a dangerous place, and it could take harsh measures to prepare a child to live in it. Pain was the medieval way of illustrating that actions had consequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://historymedren.about.com/od/medievalchildren/a/child_play_3.htm |title=The Medieval Child, Part 4: The Playful Years |publisher=About.com |accessdate=21 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Influence of John Locke ===
In his 1690 ''[[Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]'' English [[physician]] and [[philosopher]]  [[John Locke]] argued that the child resembled a blank tablet ([[tabula rasa]]) at birth, and was not inherently full of [[sin]]. In his 1693 ''[[Some Thoughts Concerning Education]]'' he suggested that the task of the parent was to build in the child the strong body and [[Habit (psychology)|habits]] of mind that would allow the capacity of [[reason]] to develop, and that [[parents]] could reward good behavior with their esteem and punish bad behavior with disgrace – the withdrawal of parental approval and affection - as opposed to beatings.&lt;ref name="FAQs.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.faqs.org/childhood/Co-Fa/Discipline.html |title=Encyclopedia of Children and Childhood in History and Society - Discipline  |publisher=FAQs.org |accessdate=21 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The twentieth century ===
In the early twentieth century, child-rearing experts abandoned a romantic view of childhood and advocated formation of proper habits to discipline children. A 1914 U.S. Children's Bureau pamphlet, ''Infant Care'', urged a strict schedule and admonished parents not to play with their babies.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} [[John B. Watson]]'s 1924 ''Behaviorism'' argued that parents could train malleable children by rewarding good behavior and punishing bad, and by following precise schedules for food, sleep, and other bodily functions.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}

Although such principles began to be rejected as early as the 1930s, they were firmly renounced in the 1946 best-seller ''[[The Common Sense Book of Baby and Child Care|Baby and Child Care]]'', by pediatrician [[Benjamin Spock]], which told parents to trust their own instincts and to view the child as a reasonable, friendly human being. Dr. Spock revised his first edition to urge more parent-centered discipline in 1957, but critics blamed his popular book for its permissive attitude during the youth rebellions of the 1960s and 1970s.&lt;ref name="FAQs.org"/&gt;

=== Conservative backlash ===

Following the permissive trend of the 1960s and early 1970s, American [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]] [[Christian]] [[James Dobson]] sought the return of a more conservative society and advocated [[spanking]] of children up to age eight.&lt;ref name=dobson&gt;{{cite book |last=Dobson |first=James |title=Dare to Discipline |year=1977 |publisher=Bantam Books |isbn=0-553-22841-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dobson's position is controversial. As early as 1985 ''The New York Times'' stated that "most child-care experts today disapprove of physical punishment."&lt;ref name=nyt85&gt;{{cite news |first=Susan |last=Wright |newspaper=The New York Times |date=19 June 1985 |page=C9 |title= Parents and Experts Split on Spanking}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many cultures, parents have historically had the right to spank their children when appropriate. A 2006 retrospective study in New Zealand, showed that physical punishment of children remained quite common in the 1970s and 1980s, with 80% of the sample reporting some kind of corporal punishment from parents, at some time during childhood. Among this sample, 29% reported being hit with an empty hand. However 45% were hit with an object, and 6% were subjected to serious physical abuse.  The study noted that abusive physical punishment tended to be given by fathers and often involved striking the child's head or torso instead of the buttocks or limbs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Millichamp |first=Jane |author2=Martin, J. |author3=Langley, J. |year=2006 |title=On the receiving end: young adults describe their parents' use of physical punishment and other disciplinary measures during childhood |journal=The New Zealand Medical Journal |volume=119 |issue=1228 |pmid=16462926 |pages= U1818}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Attitudes have changed in recent years, and legislation in some countries, particularly in continental Europe, reflect an increased skepticism toward corporal punishment.  As of December 2017, domestic corporal punishment has been outlawed in 56 countries around the world, most of them in Europe and Latin America, beginning with Sweden in 1966. Official figures show that just 10 percent of Swedish children had been spanked or otherwise struck by their parents by 2010, compared to more than 90 percent in the 1960s.&lt;ref name=swed30&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.csmonitor.com/2009/1005/p06s10-woeu.html |last= Sullivan |first= Tom |location= Boston |title=In 30 years without spanking, are Swedish children better behaved? |newspaper =The Christian Science Monitor |date=5 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Swedish law does not actually lay down any legal punishment for smacking but requires social workers to support families with problems.&lt;ref name=swed30/&gt;

Even as corporal punishment became increasingly controversial in North America, Britain, Australia and much of the rest of the English-speaking world, limited corporal punishment of children by their parents remained lawful in all 50 states of the [[United States]]. It was not until 2012 that [[Delaware]] became the first state to pass a statute defining "physical injury" to a child to include "any impairment of physical condition or pain."&lt;ref&gt;:DELAWARE STATE SENATE 146th GENERAL ASSEMBLY, SENATE BILL NO. 234, AN ACT TO AMEND TITLE 11 OF THE DELAWARE CODE RELATING TO OFFENSES AGAINST CHILDREN.

== Cultural differences ==
A number of authors have emphasized the importance of cultural differences in assessing disciplinary methods. Baumrind argues that "The cultural context critically determines the meaning and therefore the consequences of physical discipline . . ." (Baumrind, 1996; italics in original). Polite (1996) emphasizes that the "debate over whether or not to use corporal punishment rages in many ethnic communities." Larzelare, Baumrind and Polite assert that "After ignoring decades of cultural differences in the effects of spanking, these 2 ARCHIVES [1997] studies and 2 other studies in the past year have each found significantly
different effects for African Americans than for non-Hispanic European Americans. The effects of spanking in African American families are generally beneficial to children, unless it is used excessively, either in severity or in frequency." (Larzelere et al., 1998; references to other articles omitted). Our results confirm the serious differences of opinion on discipline, even in a relatively homogenous ethnic community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Amuwo |first=Shaffdeen |author2=Robert Fabian |author3=Jacqueline Hill |author4=Ardith Spence |author5=George Tolley  |journal= Journal of Socio-Economics |year=2004 |volume=33 |issue=2 |pages=153–173 |url= http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053535703001185 |accessdate=10 December 2013 |doi=10.1016/j.socec.2003.12.016 |title=Child discipline and family decision-making}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Parenting styles==
There are different [[parenting styles]] which parents use to discipline their children. Four types have been identified: authoritative parents, authoritarian parents, indulgent parents, and indifferent parents.

'''''Authoritative parents''''' are parents who use warmth, firm control, and rational, issue-oriented discipline, in which emphasis is placed on the development of self-direction. They place a high value on the development of autonomy and self-direction, but assume the ultimate responsibility for their child's behavior. "You live under my roof, you follow my rules!" is a cliché, but one that parents may often find themselves speaking - and it probably most closely mimics the authoritative parenting style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://parentingliteracy.com/parenting-a-z/44-overview/47-parenting-styles/|title=Parenting Styles|work=parentingliteracy.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Authoritarian parents''''' are parents who use punitive, absolute, and forceful discipline, and who place a premium on obedience and conformity. If parents exhibit good emotional understanding and control, children also learn to manage their own emotions and learn to understand others as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Baumrind|first=D.|date=February 1967|title=Child care practices anteceding three patterns of preschool behavior|journal=Genetic Psychology Monographs|volume=75|issue=1|pages=43–88|issn=0016-6677|pmid=6032134}}&lt;/ref&gt; These parents believe it is their responsibility to provide for their children and that their children have no right to tell the parent how best to do this. Adults are expected to know from experience what is really in the child's best interest and so adult views are allowed to take precedence over child desires. Children are perceived to know what they want but not necessarily what is best for them.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Parenting Styles. Written by Joseph Lao, Ph.D&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Indulgent parents '''''are parents who are characterized by responsiveness but low demandingness, and who are mainly concerned with the child's happiness. They behave in an accepting, benign, and somewhat more passive way in matters of discipline.

'''''Indifferent parents''''' are parents who are characterized by low levels of both responsiveness and demandingness. They try to do whatever is necessary to minimize the time and energy they must devote to interacting with their child. In extreme cases, indifferent parents may be neglectful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Steingberg |first= Laurence |title=Adolescence |year=2011 |publisher=Mcgraw-Hill |location=New York |isbn=978-0-07-353203-5 |pages=128–129}}&lt;/ref&gt; They ask very little of their children. For instance, they rarely assign their children chores. They tend to be relatively uninvolved in their children's lives. It's not that they don't love their children. It's just that they believe their children should live their own lives, as free of parental control as possible.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

A fifth type of parenting style is connectedness. '''Connected parents''' are parents who want to improve the way in which they connect with their children using an empathetic approach to challenging or even tumultuous relationships. Using the 'CALM' technique, by Jennifer Kolari, parents recognize the importance of empathy and aspire to build capacity in their children in hopes of them becoming confident and emotionally resilient. The CALM acronym stands for: '''C'''onnect emotionally, match the '''A'''ffect of the child, '''L'''isten to what your child is saying and '''M'''irror their emotion back to show understanding.&lt;ref&gt;last=Kolari |first=Jennifer |title= Connected Parenting|year=2009|publisher=Viking Canada|location=Toronto&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-physical discipline==
Non-physical discipline consists of both punitive and non-punitive methods but does not include any forms of corporal punishment such as hitting or spanking. The regular use of any single form of discipline becomes less effective when used too often, a process [[psychology|psychologists]] call [[habituation]]. Thus, no single method is considered to be for exclusive use. Non-Physical discipline is used in the concerted cultivation style of parenting that comes from the middle and upper class. concerted cultivation is the method of parenting that includes heavy parental involvement, and use reasoning and bargaining as disciplinary methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lareau |first=Annette |title=Unequal Childhoods |year=2011 |publisher= University of California Press |isbn=978-0-520-27142-5 |pages=1–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Time-outs ===
{{Main|Child time-out}}
A common method of child discipline is sending the child away from the family or group after misbehavior. Children may be told to stand in the corner ("corner time") or may be sent to their rooms for a period of time.
A [[child time-out|time-out]] involves isolating or separating a child for a few minutes and is intended to give an over-excited child time to calm down.
[[Image:Skamvrån av Carl Larsson 1894.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''Time-out'', painting by [[Carl Larsson]]]]
Alternatively, time-outs have been recommended{{By whom|date=June 2011}} as a time for parents to separate feelings of anger toward the child for their behavior and to develop a plan for discipline.

When using time-outs as a discipline strategy, individuals must also take into consideration the temperaments of the child if one decides to use time-outs. If a child, for example, has a feisty temperament, or a temperament that expresses emotion in a highly intense way, then discipline strategies of using time-outs would be ineffective because of the clash of discipline strategy to the child's temperament trait.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Marion |first=Marian |title=Guidance of Young Children |year=2007 |publisher=Pearson Prentice Hall |isbn=0-13-154530-2 |pages=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If an individual decides to use the time-out with a child as a discipline strategy, the individual must be unemotional and consistent with the undesired behavior. Along with taking into consideration the child's temperament, the length of the time-out needs to also depend on the age of the child. For example, the time-out should last one minute per year of the child's age, so if the child is five years old, the time-out should go no longer than five minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Effective discipline for children |journal=Paediatrics &amp; Child Health |date=January 2004 |volume=9 |issue=1|pages=37–41 |url= https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2719514/pdf/pch09037.pdf |accessdate=30 November 2012 |pmc=2719514 |pmid=19654979}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several experts do not recommend the use of time-out or any other form of [[punishment]]. These authors include [[Thomas Gordon (psychologist)|Thomas Gordon]], [[Alfie Kohn]], and [[Aletha Solter]].&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, T. (2000). Parent Effectiveness Training: The Proven Program for Raising Responsible Children. New York, NY: Three Rivers Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kohn, A. (2005). Unconditional Parenting: Moving From Rewards and Punishments to Love and Reason. New York, NY: Atria Books&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Solter, A. (1989). Helping Young Children Flourish. Goleta, CA: Shining Star Press, and Solter, A. (2013). Attachment Play. Goleta, CA: Shining Star Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Solter, A. (2002). The disadvantages of time-out. http://www.awareparenting.com/timeout.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Grounding ===
{{Main|Grounding (discipline technique)}}
Grounding is a form of discipline, usually, for older children, preteens and teenagers, that restricts their movement outside of the home, such as visiting friends or using the car and they are not allowed to go anywhere but school and few required places. Sometimes it is combined with the withdrawal of privileges for computer, video games, telephone or TV.

=== Scolding ===
Scolding involves reproving or criticizing a child's negative behavior and/or actions.

Some research suggests that scolding is counter-productive because parental attention (including negative attention) tends to reinforce behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |author=Johnson, Sylvia |url= http://abcnews.go.com/Primetime/10-tips-parents-defiant-children/story?id=8549664 |title= 10 Tips for Parents of Defiant Children |date= 15 September 2009 |work=ABC News |accessdate=28 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Non-punitive discipline ==
While punishments may be of limited value in consistently influencing rule-related behavior, non-punitive discipline techniques have been found to have greater impact on children who have begun to master their native language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Toner |first1=Ignatius J. |last2= |first2= |year=1986 |title=Punitive and non-punitive discipline and subsequent rule-following in young children |journal=Child and Youth Care Forum |volume=15 |issue=1 |pages=27–37 |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/r00u746076w16067/ |doi=10.1007/BF01118991 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Non-punitive discipline (also known as empathic discipline and positive discipline) is an approach to child-rearing that does not use any form of punishment. It is about loving guidance, and requires parents to have a strong relationship with their child so that the child responds to gentle guidance as opposed to threats and punishment. According to Dr. Laura Markham, the most effective discipline strategy is to make sure your child wants to please you.&lt;ref name=ahaparent&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://ahaparenting.com/parenting-tools/positive-discipline/use-positive-discipline |title= How to Use Positive Discipline |author=Markham, Dr. Laura |publisher=Aha! Parenting |accessdate=28 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Non-punitive discipline also excludes systems of "manipulative" rewards. Instead, a child's behavior is shaped by "democratic interaction" and by deepening parent-child communication. The reasoning behind it is that while punitive measures may stop the problem behavior in the short term, by themselves they do not provide a learning opportunity that allows children the autonomy to change their own behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.insideout-counselling.com.au/html/cms/12/non-punitive-discipline |title= Non-punitive discipline |publisher= Inside Out Counselling |accessdate=28 October 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Punishments such as time-outs may be seen as banishment and humiliation. Consequences as a form of punishment are not recommended, but natural consequences are considered to be possibly worthwhile learning experiences provided there is no risk of lasting harm.&lt;ref name=ahaparent /&gt;

Positive discipline is both non-violent discipline and non-punitive discipline. Criticizing, discouraging, creating obstacles and barriers, blaming, shaming, using sarcastic or cruel humor, or using physical punishment are some negative disciplinary methods used with young children. Any parent may occasionally do any of these things, but doing them more than once in a while may lead to low self-esteem becoming a permanent part of the child's personality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.athealth.com/Consumer/Issues/discipline.html |title=Positive discipline |date=20 May 2008 |publisher=AtHealth.com |accessdate=28 October 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Authors in this field include [[Aletha Solter]], [[Alfie Kohn]], Pam Leo, [[Haim Ginott]], [[Thomas Gordon (psychologist)|Thomas Gordon]], [[Lawrence J. Cohen (author)|Lawrence J. Cohen]], and [[John Gottman]].

=== Essential aspects ===
In the past, harsh discipline has been the norm for families in society. However, research by psychologists has brought about new forms of effective discipline. Positive discipline is based on minimizing the child's frustrations and misbehavior rather than giving punishments. The main focus in this method is the "Golden Rule", treat others the way you want to be treated. Parents follow this when disciplining their children because they believe that their point will reach the children more effectively rather than traditional discipline. The foundation of this style of discipline is encouraging children to feel good about themselves and building the parent's relationship with the child so the child wants to please the parent. In traditional discipline, parents would instill fear in their child by using shame and humiliation to get their point across. However, studies show that this type of punishment ultimately causes the children to have more psychological problems in their adolescence and adulthood. Physical and harsh punishment shows the child that violence and negative treatment is acceptable in some circumstances, wheres, positive discipline demonstrates the opposite. In positive discipline the parents avoid negative treatment and focus on the importance of communication and showing unconditional love. Feeling loved, important and well liked has positive and negative effects on how a child perceives themselves. The child will feel important if the child feels well liked and loved by a person.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = No More Perfect Kids:Love Your Kids for Who They Are|last = Savage|first = Jill|publisher = Moody PubLishers|year = 2014|isbn = 9780802411525|location = |pages = |last2 = Koch|first2 = Kathy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other important aspects are reasonable and age-appropriate expectations, feeding healthy foods and providing enough rest, giving clear instructions which may need to be repeated, looking for the causes of any misbehavior and making adjustments, and building routines. Children are helped by knowing what is happening in their lives. Having some predictability about their day without necessarily being regimental will help reduce frustration and misbehavior.&lt;ref name=pchsa&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.cyh.com/HealthTopics/HealthTopicDetails.aspx?p=114&amp;np=141&amp;id=2309 |title= The Nanny Show and you |publisher=Parenting and Child Health Services South Australia |accessdate=1 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not only are the children taught to be open-minded, but the parents must demonstrate this as well.

=== Methods ===

==== Praise and rewards ====
{{Main|Operant conditioning}}
Simply giving the child spontaneous expressions of appreciation or acknowledgement when they are not misbehaving will act as a reinforcer for good behavior. Focusing on good behavior versus bad behavior will encourage appropriate behavior in the given situation. According to B. F. Skinner, past behavior that is reinforced with praise is likely to repeat in the same or similar situation.&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, B.F. ''About Behaviorism''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In operant conditioning, schedules of reinforcement are an important component of the learning process. When and how often we reinforce a behavior can have a dramatic impact on the strength and rate of the response.
A schedule of reinforcement is basically a rule stating which instances of a behavior will be reinforced. In some case, a behavior might be reinforced every time it occurs. Sometimes, a behavior might not be reinforced at all. Either positive reinforcement or negative reinforcement might be used, depending on the situation. In both cases, the goal of reinforcement is always to strengthen the behavior and increase the likelihood that it will occur again in the future.
In real-world settings, behaviors are probably not going to be reinforced each and every time they occur. For situations where you are purposely trying to train and reinforce an action, such as in the classroom, in sports or in animal training, you might opt to follow a specific reinforcement schedule. As you'll see below, some schedules are best suited to certain types of training situations. In some cases, training might call for starting out with one schedule and switching to another once the desired behavior has been taught.&lt;ref&gt;SKINNER, B. F. The behavior of organisms. New York: D. Appleton-Century Co., 1938.&lt;/ref&gt;

; Example of operant conditioning

'''[[Positive reinforcement]]''': Whenever he is being good, cooperative, solves things non-aggressively, immediately reward those behaviors with praise, attention, goodies.

'''Punishment''': If acting aggressively, give immediate, undesired consequence (send to corner; say "NO!" and couple with response cost).

'''Response cost:''' Most common would be "time-out". Removing sources of attention by placing in an environment without other people. Careful: This can become (aversive) punishment, depending on how done. To be response cost, it can only simply be taking away a desirable thing; not adding a negative one.

'''[[Negative reinforcement]]:''' One example would be to couple negative reinforcement with response cost—after some period of time in which he has acted cooperatively or calmly while in the absence of others, can bring him back with others. Thus, taking away the isolation should reinforce the desired behavior (being cooperative).

'''Extinction:''' Simply ignoring behaviors should lead to extinction. Note: that initially when ignored, can expect an initial increase in the behavior—a very trying time in situations such as a child that is acting out.&lt;ref&gt;Zeilberger, J., Sampen, S., &amp; Sloan, H. (1968). Modification of a child's problem behaviors in the home with the mother as therapist. Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis, 1, 47-53.)&lt;/ref&gt;

It is common for children who are otherwise ignored by their parents to turn to misbehavior as a way of seeking attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=How can I discipline my children? |publisher=BBC |location= London |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/parents/life/health_happiness/problems/discipline_home.shtml |accessdate = 13 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example is a child screaming for attention. Parents often inadvertently reward the bad behavior by immediately giving them the attention, thereby reinforcing it. On the other hand, parents may wait until the child calms down and speaks politely, then reward the more polite behavior with the attention.

==== Natural consequences ====
{{Main|Operant conditioning}}
Natural consequences involve children learning from their own mistakes. In this method, the parent's job is to teach the child which behaviors are inappropriate. In order to do this, parents should allow the child to make a mistake and let them experience the natural results from their behavior. For instance, if a child forgets to bring his lunch to school, he will find himself hungry later. Using natural consequences would be indicative of the theory of accomplishment of natural growth, which is the parenting style of the working class and poor.  The accomplishment of natural growth focuses on separation between children and family. Children are given directives and expected to carry them out without complaint or delay. Children are responsible for themselves during their free time, and the parent's main concern is caring for the children's physical needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lareau |first=Annette |title=Unequal Childhoods |year=2011 |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=978-0-520-27142-5 |pages=2–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order for this method to be effective the parents cannot shield their child from harm or from getting in trouble. They must allow for the mistake to occur in order for the child to learn the consequences. For example, a basic natural consequence is that if the child touches a hot pot he will get burned. The consequence is usually immediate, and the parent may have little control when protecting the child. However, the pain is the consequence of touching the pot which will teach the child to not do that again.

====Internal discipline and democracy====
:''Main articles: [[School discipline#Discipline in Sudbury Model Democratic Schools|Discipline in Sudbury Model Democratic Schools]] and [[Sudbury Valley School]]''

[[Sudbury Valley School|Sudbury model]] democratic schools, attended by children ages 4 to 19, claim that popularly based authority can maintain order more effectively than dictatorial authority for governments and schools alike.

Furthermore, they emphasize that much more important than the externals of order is the question of the sources of internal discipline: how does an individual come to develop the inner strength and character that endows his life with order and coherence, an independent person appropriate to a free republic of co-equal citizens, capable of making decisions within a rational, self-consistent framework—a person treating and being treated with respect?

They affirm that the hallmark of the independent person is the ability to bear responsibility and since there is no way of teaching or training another person for self-sufficiency, there is no technique for obtaining or transmitting these traits. Hence, the only way a person becomes responsible for himself is for him to be responsible for himself, with no reservation or qualifications. Thence the need to permit children, at home and school, freedom of choice, freedom of action, and freedom to bear the results of action—the three great freedoms that constitute personal responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;The Crisis in American Education &amp;mdash; An Analysis and a Proposal, [http://www.sudval.com/05_onepersononevote.html#02 The Sudbury Valley School] (1970), [https://books.google.com/books?id=MAqxzEss8k4C&amp;pg=PA49&amp;dq=The+Crisis+in+American+Education+%E2%80%94+An+Analysis+and+a+Proposal,+The+Sudbury+Valley+School+(1970),+Law+and+Order:+Foundations+of+Discipline ''Law and Order: Foundations of Discipline''] (pg. 49-55).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5451">'''Chip formation''' is part of the process of cutting materials by mechanical means, using tools such as [[saw]]s, [[lathe]]s and [[milling machine|milling]] cutters. An understanding of the theory and engineering of this formation is an important part of the development of such machines and their cutting tools.

The formal study of chip formation was encouraged around [[World War II]] and shortly afterwards, with increases in the use of faster and more powerful cutting machines, particularly for metal cutting with the new [[high speed steel]] cutters. Pioneering work in this field was carried out by Kivima (1952) and Franz (1958).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

Chip formation is usually described according to a three-way model developed by Franz. This model is best known within the field of machine tool design, although it is also used when an application area, such as [[woodworking]], requires a vocabulary to describe chip formation in more detail than is usually attempted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

== Chip classification ==
The first three chip types are the original characterisation, by Dr. Norman Franz. The type of chip that forms depends on many factors, of both tool and material. In general, main factors are the angle formed by the edge faces of the tool and also the angle at which this is presented to the surface.

Sharpness of the cutting tool does not usually define the ''type'' of chip, but rather the ''quality'' of the chip, and the clear distinctions between types. A blunt tool produces a degenerate chip that is large, torn and varies from one means of formation to another, often leaving behind a poor quality surface where this means changes.

=== {{visible anchor|Type I chip}} ===
[[File:Chip formation Type I.svg|thumb|Type I chip]]
Type I chips form when a material splits ''ahead'' of the cutting edge, owing to some upwards wedge action of the tool exceeding the [[tensile strength|''tensile'' strength]] of the material, perpendicular to the surface. They are thus particularly important in fibrous materials, such as wood, where individual fibres are strong but they may be levered apart relatively easily. Type I chips generally form in cutting by tools with shallow cutting angles.

Type I chips may form long, continuous [[swarf]], limited in size only by the length of cut.

This is the idealised chip formation for [[wood shaving]]s,&lt;ref name="Elliott, Wood shavings" /&gt; particularly those produced by a well-tuned [[plane (tool)|plane]] with a finely adjusted mouth.

=== {{visible anchor|Type II chip}} ===
[[File:Chip formation Type II.svg|thumb|Type II chip]]
Type II chips form when a shearing force is produced by the wedge of the tool angle. The material fails along a short angled plane, from the apex of the tool edge, diagonally upwards and forwards to the surface. The material deforms along this line, forming an upward curling chip. These chips generally form from intermediate cutting angles.

Type II chips may form in ductile materials, such as metals.

Type II chips may also form long, continuous [[swarf]].

=== {{visible anchor|Type III chip}} ===
[[File:Climb Milling 01.png|thumb|Type III chip formation during [[Milling cutter|climb milling]]]]
Type III chips form a compression failure of the material, ahead of a relatively obtuse cutting angle, approaching 90°. In some weak or non-ductile materials this may form an acceptable chip, usually as a fine dust, but often it gives rise instead to a random "snowplough" effect where the waste material is bunched up ahead of the tool but not cleared decisively away as a well-formed chip.

This type of chip is formed by [[router (woodworking)|router]]s. It is also formed by woodworking scrapers, although when properly sharpened and used, these form such a thin Type III chip that it instead appears as a well-formed Type II chip. Their waste chip is thin enough that the compression failure volume is small enough to act as for the well-defined shear plane of the Type II.

=== {{visible anchor|Type 0 chip}} ===
This type was characterised later, by William McKenzie (1960).{{efn-lr|McKenzie also used the terms Type I and Type II chips, although confusingly these are not the same as Franz'.}}

'''Condition of possibility''' (''Bedingungen der Möglichkeit'') is a [[philosophic]]al [[concept]] made popular by [[Immanuel Kant]].

A condition of possibility is a necessary framework for the possible appearance of a given list of entities. It is often used in contrast to the unilateral [[causality]] concept, or even to the notion of [[interaction]]. For example, consider a cube made by an artisan. All cubes are three-dimensional. If an object is three-dimensional, then it is an extended object. But extension is an impossibility without space. Therefore, space is a condition of possibility because it is a necessary condition for the existence of cubes to be possible. Note, however, that [[space]] did not cause the cube, but that the artisan did, and that the cube and space are distinct entities, so space isn’t part of the definition of cube.

{{cns|text=[[Gilles Deleuze]] presented it as a dichotomy in contradistinction to the classical [[phenomenon]]/[[noumenon]] dichotomy.|date=March 2016}} From [[Plato]] to [[Descartes]], what was presented by the senses was deemed illusory and {{clarify|text=denigrated|date=March 2016}}. It was believed that the perceptions ought to be overcome to grasp the [[thing-in-itself]], the essential essence, also known as Plato’s [[allegory of the cave]]. With Kant comes a transition in philosophy from this dichotomy to the dichotomy of the {{cfy|reason=technical term?|text=apparition|date=March 2016}}/{{cfy|reason=technical term?|text=conditions-of-appearance|date=March 2016}}. There is no longer any higher essence behind the {{cfy|reason=technical term?|text=apparition|date=March 2016}}. It is what it is, a brute fact, and what one must now examine is the conditions that are necessary for its appearance. Immanuel Kant does just this in the [[The Critique of Pure Reason#Transcendental Aesthetic|Transcendental Aesthetic]], when he examines the necessary conditions for the [[analytic-synthetic distinction|synthetic]] ''[[a priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' cognition of [[mathematics]]. But Kant ''was'' {{clarify|text=a transition|reason=unclear; technical term?|date=March 2016}}, so he still maintains the phenomenon/noumenon dichotomy, but the noumenon has already been relegated unknowable and to be ignored.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.webdeleuze.com/php/texte.php?cle=58&amp;groupe=Kant&amp;langue=1 Deleuze: Kant: 14 March 1978.] (in French)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Michel Foucault|Foucault]] would come to adapt it in a [[historical]] sense through the concept of "[[episteme]]":

&lt;blockquote&gt; what I am attempting to bring to light is the epistemological field, the ''épistémè'' in which knowledge, envisaged apart from all criteria having reference to its rational value or to its objective forms, grounds its positivity and thereby manifests a history which is not that of its growing perfection, but rather that of its conditions of possibility; in this account, what should appear are those configurations within the space of knowledge which have given rise to the diverse forms of empirical science. Such an enterprise is not so much a history, in the traditional meaning of that word, as an ‘archaeology’.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Michel | last = Foucault | title = The Order of Things | year = 2002 | page = xxiii-xxiv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5380">A '''courtesy book''' or '''book of manners''' was a book dealing with issues of [[etiquette]], behaviour and morals, with a particular focus on the life at princely [[Court (royal)|courts]]. Courtesy literature can be traced back to 13th century German and Italian writers.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation
|contribution=courtesy literature

|year=2008
|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/140802/courtesy-literature}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medieval==
Courtesy books formed part of the didactic literature of the Middle Ages, covering topics from religion and ethics to social awareness and social conduct.&lt;ref&gt;D. T. Kline ed., ''Medieval Literature for Children'' (2012) p. 83-94&lt;/ref&gt; While firmly normative in their bent, they also showed an awareness of the human realities that did not fit neatly under the rubric of their precepts.&lt;ref&gt;D. T. Kline ed., ''Medieval Literature for Children'' (2012) p. 98&lt;/ref&gt; Such books appealed both to an aristocratic readership and to aspiring urban middle classes.&lt;ref&gt;K. M. Ashley/M. D. Johnston eds., ''Medieval Conduct Books'' (2009) p. xxxii&lt;/ref&gt;

The oldest known courtesy book from Germany is the mid-thirteenth century ''[[Tannhäuser]]'' Book of Manners.&lt;ref&gt;Bumke,2000&lt;/ref&gt;

Another of the oldest known courtesy books of Germany, is the learning-poems of "[[Winsbecke]]" and "[[Winsbeckin]]", written around 1220 by an anonymous author. 

The oldest known courtesy book from Italy is the 1215/16 ''Der Wälsche Gast'' by [[Thomasin von Zirclaere]], speaking to a German audience.

==Renaissance==
The Renaissance saw the re-emergence of urban civilisation in the Italian city-states, drawing on the earlier urban civilizations of ancient Greece and Rome, but developing new ideals of manners and courtesy. Three sixteenth century Italian texts on courtly manners and morals – [[Baldassarre Castiglione]]'s ''[[Il Cortegiano]]'' (1528); [[Giovanni della Casa|Giovanni della Casa's]] ''[[Il Galateo]]'' (1558) and [[Stefano Guazzo|Stefano Guazzo's]] ''[[La Civil Conversazione]]'' (1574) in four volumes – had an especially wide influence both south and north of the Alps.  [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor]], apparently had at his bedside three books: the [[Bible]], [[Nicolò Machiavelli|Nicolò Machiavelli's]] ''[[The Prince]]'', and ''[[Il Cortegiano]]'' (''The Courtier '').&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Clark, ''Civilisation'' (1969) p. 111&lt;/ref&gt; Through Castiglione's writings, the Italian ideals of Neo-Platonism, beauty and symmetry, and the amateur author, reached a wide humanist audience,&lt;ref&gt;B. Ford ed., ''The Age of Shakespeare'' (1973) pp. 23, 91, and 131&lt;/ref&gt; as did the new Italianate emphasis on the self in society and the importance of social appearances.&lt;ref&gt;K. A. Wolberg, ''"All Possible Art"'' (2008) p. 101&lt;/ref&gt;

The norms for [[personal boundaries]] and social [[proxemics]] established by figures such as della Casa still influence the Western world almost a half millennium later.&lt;ref&gt;[[Erving Goffman]], ''Relations in Public'' (1971) p. 72&lt;/ref&gt;

===English translations and developments===

In 1561, [[Thomas Hoby]] published ''The Courtyer'', his translation of ''Il Cortegiano'', (although he had made the translation a decade earlier). The work was read widely and influenced the writings of [[Shakespeare]], [[Edmund Spenser]] and [[Ben Jonson]]. Robert Peterson's translation of ''Il Galateo'' appeared in 1576. [[George Pettie]] translated the first three books of Guazzo's work into ''The Civil Conversation'' in 1581; the fourth and last volume from ''La Civil Conversazione'' appeared five years later in a translation by [[Bartholomew Yonge]]. 

A well-known English example of the genre is [[Henry Peacham (born 1578)|Henry Peacham]]'s ''The Compleat Gentleman'' of 1622.&lt;ref name=ocel&gt;See the articles "Courtesy Literature" and "Hoby" in

==Later developments==
Courtesy books continued to be written into the 1700s, the last traditional English one being [[Lord Chesterfield]]'s ''Letters to His Son''&lt;ref&gt;I. Ousby ed., ''The Cambridge Guide to Literature in English'' (1995) p. 212&lt;/ref&gt; – memorably described by [[Samuel Johnson]] as teaching "the morals of a whore and the manners of a dancing-master".&lt;ref&gt;James Boswell, ''Life of Johnson'' (Penguin 1984) p. 77&lt;/ref&gt; However they took on a new form in the fiction of the time, much of it (like the work of [[Sir Charles Grandison]]) filling a similar normative role.&lt;ref&gt;S. K. Marks, ''Sir Charles Grandison'' (1986) p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;

{{wiktionary}}

'''Critique''' is a [[wikt:method|method]] of disciplined, systematic study of a written or oral [[discourse]]. Although critique is commonly understood as fault finding and negative judgment,&lt;ref name="Gasche07p12"&gt;[[Rodolphe Gasché]] (2007) [https://books.google.com/books?id=_CZVDv6bdXIC&amp;pg=PA12 ''The honor of thinking: critique, theory, philosophy''] pp. 12–13 quote: {{quotation|Let us also remind ourselves of the fact that throughout the eighteenth century, which Kant, in ''Critique of Pure Reason'', labeled "in especial degree, the age of criticism" and to which our use of "critique", today remains largely indebted, critique was above all critique of prejudice and established authority, and hence was intimately tied to a conception of the human being as capable of self-thinking, hence authonomous, and free from religious and political authorities.}}&lt;/ref&gt; it can also involve merit recognition, and in the philosophical tradition it also means a methodical practice of doubt.&lt;ref name="Gasche07p12"/&gt; The contemporary sense of critique has been largely influenced by the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] critique of prejudice and authority, which championed the emancipation and autonomy from religious and political authorities.&lt;ref name="Gasche07p12"/&gt;

The term ''critique'' derives, via French, from Ancient Greek {{lang|grc|κριτική}} ({{transl|grc|ISO|kritikē}}), meaning "the faculty of judgment", that is, discerning the value of persons or things.&lt;ref name="OED"&gt;{{OED|critick}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critique is also known as major [[logic]], as opposed to minor [[logic]] or [[dialectic]]s.

== Critique in philosophy ==
Philosophy is the application of critical thought{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}, and is the disciplined practice of processing the ''theory/praxis problem''. In [[philosophy|philosophical]] contexts, such as law or academics, critique is most influenced by [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s use of the term to mean a reflective examination of the validity and limits of a human capacity or of a set of philosophical claims. This has been extended in [[modern philosophy]] to mean a systematic inquiry into the conditions and consequences of a [[concept]], a [[theory]], a [[discipline]], or an approach and/or attempt to understand the limitations and [[Validity (logic)|validity]] of that. A ''critical perspective'', in this sense, is the opposite of a [[dogma]]tic one. Kant wrote:

{{quote|We deal with a concept dogmatically ... if we consider it as contained under another concept of the object which constitutes a principle of reason and determine it in conformity with this. But we deal with it merely critically if we consider it only in reference to our cognitive faculties and consequently to the subjective conditions of thinking it, without undertaking to decide anything about its object.&lt;ref&gt;Immanuel Kant, ''[[Critique of Judgment]]'' section 74.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Later thinkers such as [[Hegel]] used the word 'critique' in a broader way than Kant's sense of the word, to mean the systematic inquiry into the limits of a [[doctrine]] or ''set'' of concepts. This referential expansion led, for instance, to the formulation of the idea of social critique, such as arose after [[Karl Marx]]'s theoretical work delineated in his [[Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy]] (1859), which was a critique of the then-current models of economic theory and thought of that time. Further critique can then be applied after the fact, by using thorough critique as a basis for new argument. The idea of ''critique'' is elemental to legal, aesthetic, and literary theory and such practices, such as in the analysis and evaluation of [[writing]]s such as pictorial, musical, or expanded textual works.&lt;ref&gt;For an overview of philosophical conceptions of critique from Spinoza to Rancière see K. de Boer and R. Sonderegger (eds.), ''Conceptions of Critique in Modern and Contemporary Philosophy'' (Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Critique vs criticism ==
In French, German, or Italian, no distinction is drawn between 'critique' and '[[criticism]]': the two words both translate as ''critique'', ''Kritik'', and ''critica'', respectively.&lt;ref name="Vattimo90p57"&gt;[[Gianni Vattimo]] [https://books.google.com/books?id=i7QOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA57 ''Postmodern criticism: postmodern critique''] in David Wood (1990) ''Writing the future'', pp. 57–58&lt;/ref&gt; In the English language, according to philosopher [[Gianni Vattimo]], ''criticism'' is used more frequently to denote [[literary criticism]] or [[art criticism]], that is the interpretation and evaluation of literature and art; while ''critique'' may be used to refer to more general and profound writing as [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s ''[[Critique of pure reason]]''.&lt;ref name="Vattimo90p57"/&gt; Another proposed distinction is that critique is never personalized nor [[ad hominem]], but is instead the analyses of the structure of the thought in the content of the item critiqued.&lt;ref name="Vattimo90p57"/&gt; This analysis then offers by way of the critique method either a rebuttal or a suggestion of further expansion upon the problems presented by the topic of that specific written or oral argumentation. Even authors that believe there might be a distinction suggest that there is some ambiguity that is still unresolved.&lt;ref name="Vattimo90p57"/&gt;

==Critical theory==
{{main|Critical theory}}
Marx's work inspired the '[[Frankfurt School]]' of  [[critical theory]], now best exemplified in the work of [[Jürgen Habermas]].&lt;ref&gt;David Ingram, ''Habermas: Introduction and Analysis'', New York: Cornell University Press, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; This, in turn, helped inspire the [[cultural studies]] form of social critique, which treats cultural products and their reception as evidence of wider social ills such as [[racism]] or [[gender bias]]. Social critique has been further extended in the work of [[Michel Foucault]]&lt;ref&gt;Michel Foucault, ''Was ist Kritik?'', Berlin: Merve Verlag 1992. {{ISBN|3-88396-093-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and of [[Alasdair MacIntyre]].&lt;ref&gt;Alasdair MacIntyre, ''After Virtue'', Notre Dame: University of Notre Dama Press, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt; In their different and radically contrasting ways, MacIntyre and Foucault go well beyond the original Kantian meaning of the term ''critique'' in contesting legitimatory accounts of social power.

'''''Crown Fountain''''' is an interactive work of [[public art]]  and [[video sculpture]] featured in [[Chicago]]'s [[Millennium Park]], which is located in the [[Chicago Loop|Loop]] [[Community areas of Chicago|community area]].

Residents and critics have praised the fountain for its artistic and entertainment features.&lt;ref name=CFsss1MDaMAJPBwK&amp;SAC&gt;{{cite web|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CTRB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=103E95433B5215DE&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=AA98CDC331574F0ABEAFF732B33DC0B2|title=Crown Fountain&amp;mdash;***1/2*&amp;mdash;Monroe Drive and Michigan Avenue&amp;mdash;Jaume Plensa, Barcelona with Krueck &amp; Sexton Architects, Chicago |accessdate=July 25, 2008|date=July 18, 2004 |publisher=Newsbank|work= Chicago Tribune |author=Kamin, Blair}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WotwAJPrtfft2c&gt;{{cite web|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CSTB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=103F33C4C7E1B57A&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=AA98CDC331574F0ABEAFF732B33DC0B2|title=Walking on the water&amp;mdash;Artist Jaume Plensa reinvents the fountain for the 21st century|accessdate=July 25, 2008|date=July 12, 2004|publisher=Newsbank|work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|author=Nance, Kevin}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CarNoosrcbapc/&gt;  It highlights Plensa's [[Theme (visual arts)|themes]] of dualism, light, and water, extending the use of video technology from his prior works.&lt;ref name=G288/&gt; Its use of water is unique among Chicago's many fountains, in that it promotes physical interaction between the public and the water.  Both the fountain and Millennium Park are highly accessible because of their [[universal design]].&lt;ref name=PVA/&gt;

''Crown Fountain'' has been one of the most controversial of all the Millennium Park features.  Before it was even built, some were concerned that the sculpture's height violated the aesthetic tradition of the park.  After construction, surveillance cameras were installed atop the fountain, which led to a public outcry (and their quick removal).

However, the fountain has survived its contentious beginnings to find its way into Chicago pop culture.  It is a popular subject for photographers and a common gathering place.  While some of the videos displayed are of scenery, most attention has focused on its video clips of local residents. The fountain is a public play area and offers people an escape from summer heat, allowing children  to frolic in the fountain's water.&lt;ref name=NSaHHTD/&gt;

==Concept and design==
{{Millennium Park Map}}
[[Grant Park (Chicago)|Grant Park]], which is between [[Lake Michigan]] and the [[central business district]], is commonly called "Chicago's Front Yard".&lt;ref name=CtfoinfyMPptt/&gt;&lt;ref name=IafoGPCmfasr/&gt;  Its northwest corner had been [[Illinois Central Railroad|Illinois Central]] rail yards and parking lots until 1997, when it was made available for development by the city as [[Millennium Park]].&lt;ref name=MPNYT&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/06/books/chapters/0806-1st-gilf.html|title=Millennium Park|accessdate=June 24, 2008|date=August 6, 2006|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|work=[[The New York Times]]|author=Gilfoyle, Timothy J.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Millennium Park was conceived in 1998 as the capstone of Grant Park, to celebrate the new millennium and to feature world-renowned architects, artists, designers, landscape architects, and urban planners.&lt;ref name=PVA/&gt; As of 2007, Millennium Park trails only [[Navy Pier]] as a Chicago tourist attraction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Crain's List Lartgest Tourist Attractions (Sightseeing): Ranked by 2007 attendance|date=June 23, 2008|page=22|publisher=[[Crain Communications Inc.]]|work=Crain's Chicago Business}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fountain is centrally located in Chicago: it is east of [[Michigan Avenue (Chicago)|Michigan Avenue]] and its [[Historic Michigan Boulevard District]], north of Monroe Street and the [[Art Institute of Chicago]]; and south of Madison Street. Looking north from the fountain, viewers see some of the [[tallest buildings in the United States]] ([[Aon Center (Chicago)|Aon Center]], [[Two Prudential Plaza]], and [[One Prudential Plaza]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Tallest Buildings in the United States1 |url=http://www.ctbuh.org/Portals/0/Tallest/CTBUH_TallestUSA.pdf |publisher=[[Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat]] |accessdate=September 2, 2009 }}{{dead link|date=January 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Selection of artist===
In December 1999, [[Lester Crown]] and his family agreed to sponsor a [[water feature]] in [[Millennium Park]].  Unlike other park feature sponsors, the Crowns acted independently of Millennium Park officials; they conducted independent surveys of water technologies, held their own informal design contest, and stayed active in the design and engineering of the project.&lt;ref name=Gilfoyle27880&gt;Gilfoyle, pp. 278–280.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Crowns were open-minded about the choice of artist; wanting a modern work, they solicited proposals from a list of prospective artists and architects.&lt;ref name=Gilfoyle27880/&gt; Jaume Plensa researched the traditions and history of fountains and studied [[anthropomorphism]] in fountain imagery.&lt;ref name=G287/&gt;  Some of his early ideas for the project referenced [[Buckingham Fountain]], but these were soon abandoned.&lt;ref name=G288&gt;Gilfoyle, p. 288.&lt;/ref&gt; His presentation to the Crown family started with a slide show of fountains from the [[Middle Ages]] through the 20th&amp;nbsp;century.  Plensa focused on the philosophical meanings associated with fountains, their history, use and art.&lt;ref name=G287&gt;Gilfoyle, p. 287.&lt;/ref&gt;  His presentation included [[computer animation]] of facial expressions.&lt;ref name=MFHtMPfdeadcSHFahocCtpotaatm/&gt; The other finalists were [[Maya Lin]], who presented a low-height horizontal form, and [[Robert Venturi]], who presented a fountain that would have been {{convert|150|ft|m}} tall.&lt;ref name=G280/&gt; In January 2000, Plensa won the commission to design the fountain over Lin and Venturi.&lt;ref name=WotwAJPrtfft2c/&gt;&lt;ref name=G280&gt;Gilfoyle, p. 280.&lt;/ref&gt;  The installation is a video sculpture, commissioned to operate thirty years.&lt;ref name=JMSAN&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uiowa.edu/jmc/alumni/index.html |title=J-MC School Alumni News |accessdate=August 6, 2008 |date=August 26, 2004 |publisher=School of Journalism &amp; Mass Communication, The University of Iowa |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080804220905/http://www.uiowa.edu/jmc/alumni/index.html |archivedate=August 4, 2008 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--   What is the boundary on spelling out numbers ??

Prior to ''Crown Fountain'', Plensa's dominant theme had been dualism,&lt;ref&gt;Gilfoyle, p. 282.&lt;/ref&gt; which he had expanded to artworks in which the viewers are outside, and the visible subjects of the art are inside containers and hollow spaces.  In the 1990s, he completed several outdoor sculptures in which he explored the use of light (''The Star of David'' (1998) at [[Stockholm]]'s Raoul Wallenberg Square, ''Bridge of Light'' (1998) in Jerusalem), and  LED technology, video, and computer design (''Gläserne Seele &amp; Mr. Net'' in Brandenburg (1999–2000)).&lt;ref&gt;Gilfoyle, p. 283.&lt;/ref&gt;  In his public art, Plensa challenged himself to involve the viewer with his art, which led to his conception of the ''Crown Fountain''.&lt;ref name=G287/&gt;  His objective  was to create a socially relevant, interactive  fountain for the 21st&amp;nbsp;century.&lt;ref name=G285&gt;Gilfoyle, p. 285.&lt;/ref&gt;  Since water is the focus of a fountain, and since Chicago, and especially Millennium Park, is so greatly affected by the nearby waterfront, Plensa sought to create an eternal water work to complement the local natural inspirations.&lt;ref name=G288/&gt; Because of the colder winters common to the [[climate of Chicago]], Plensa created a fountain that would remain vibrant when the water was inactive in the wintertime, so the fountain is an experience of light themes and the use of video technology.&lt;ref name=G288/&gt;

Plensa explores dualism with ''Crown Fountain'', where he has two randomly selected faces "conversing" with each other.&lt;ref name=BSBDBA/&gt; Plensa feels that by using faces, he can represent the diversity of the city both in ethnicity and in age.&lt;ref name=Hystf&gt;{{cite web|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CSTB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=119F8FEDC3E36068&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=AA98CDC331574F0ABEAFF732B33DC0B2 |title= Have you seen this face?; Many have yet to see their own images |publisher=NewsBank |work=Chicago Sun-Times|date=June 24, 2007 |accessdate=April 22, 2008 |author=Nance, Kevin}}&lt;/ref&gt; The artist intends to portray the [[sociocultural evolution]] of the city by updating the collection of images.&lt;ref name=Artropolis/&gt;  His representation has become a part of the city's  pop culture; the first few episodes of the first season of ''[[Prison Break]]'' featured shots of the fountain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timeout.com/chicago/articles/features/12287/big-house-on-the-prairie |title=Big house on the prairie: TOC goes behind bars for a preview of Prison Break, an arresting TV drama serving time on location around Chicago |accessdate=August 8, 2008 |date=August 24, 2005 |publisher=Time Out Chicago |author=Lyons, Margaret |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090210132409/http://www.timeout.com/chicago/articles/features/12287/big-house-on-the-prairie |archivedate=February 10, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Plensa feels that the challenge in the creation of successful work of [[public art]] is to integrate the viewer into an interactive relationship with the art.&lt;ref name=G285/&gt;  The fountain is known for encouraging its visitors to splash and slide in the reflecting pool, jostle for position under the water spout and place themselves under the cascade.&lt;ref name=CarNoosrcbapc/&gt;&lt;ref name=NSaHHTD/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CTRB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=104039DBC0769388&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=AA98CDC331574F0ABEAFF732B33DC0B2|title=Park is awash in art that raises ageless queries|accessdate=August 5, 2008|date=July 23, 2004|publisher=Newsbank|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|author=Schmich, Mary}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AAGPoCF&gt;{{cite web|url=http://travel.nytimes.com/2007/11/04/travel/04frugal.html|title=Amid Architectural Glories, Piles of Cheap Fun |publisher=The New York Times Company|work=[[The New York Times]]|date= November 4, 2007|author=Gross, Matt|accessdate=July 28, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This interactivity was to some degree accidental.  Although the city planned for some interactivity, the transformation of the fountain into a water park for kids within hours of opening surprised Plensa.&lt;ref name=G291/&gt;  Now, when the [[National Weather Service]] issues summer [[heat advisory|heat advisories]] and the [[Governor of Illinois]] declares state office buildings as official daytime [[cooling center]]s, the national press points to ''Crown Fountain'' as a respite for inhabitants of the [[Chicago metropolitan area]].&lt;ref name=NSaHHTD&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/18/us/18sizzle.html|title=Nation Sweats as Heat Hits Triple Digits|publisher=The New York Times Company|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=July 28, 2008|date=July 18, 2006|author=Steinhauer, Jennifer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Video production===
Approximately 75 ethnic, social, and religious Chicago organizations were asked to provide candidates whose faces would be photographed for integration into the fountain.&lt;ref name=s85/&gt; The subjects were chosen from local schools, churches and community groups, and filming began in 2001 at the downtown campus of the [[School of the Art Institute of Chicago]] (SAIC). The SAIC students filmed their subjects with a $100,000 high-definition [[HDW-F900]] [[video camera]], the same model used in the production of the three ''[[Star Wars]]'' prequels.&lt;ref name=MFHtMPfdeadcSHFahocCtpotaatm/&gt;&lt;ref name=MPfpibffSmaahvsgfadr/&gt; About 20 SAIC students took part in what became an informal master's course in [[public art]] for the project.&lt;ref name=s85&gt;Sharoff, p. 85&lt;/ref&gt; Faculty from [[Columbia College Chicago]] was also involved in the production of the video.&lt;ref name=JMSAN/&gt; The high-definition equipment was used because of the scale of the project.&lt;ref name=MFHtMPfdeadcSHFahocCtpotaatm/&gt;  Because the image proportions were like a [[movie screen]] with a width far exceeding its height, the camera was turned on its side during filming.&lt;ref name=s85/&gt;

Each face appears on the sculpture for a total of 5&amp;nbsp;minutes using various parts of individual 80-second videos.&lt;ref name=MFHtMPfdeadcSHFahocCtpotaatm/&gt; A 40-second section is played at one-third speed forward and backward, running for a total of 4&amp;nbsp;minutes.&lt;ref name=Hystf/&gt; Then, there is a subsequent segment, where the mouth is puckering, that is stretched to 15&amp;nbsp;seconds.  This is followed by a section, in which the water appears to spout from the open mouth, that is stretched to last for 30&amp;nbsp;seconds.  Finally, there is a smile after the completion of the water spouting from the mouth, that is slowed to extend for 15&amp;nbsp;seconds.&lt;ref name=MFHtMPfdeadcSHFahocCtpotaatm/&gt; Of the original 1,051&amp;nbsp;subjects filmed, 960&amp;nbsp;videos were determined to be usable for the project.&lt;ref name=Hystf/&gt; Originally, the set of images was presumed to be the beginning of a work in progress, but as of 2009 no additional videos are planned.&lt;ref name=s85/&gt;

To achieve the effect in which water appears to be flowing from subjects' mouths, each video has a segment where the subject's lips are puckered, which is then timed to correspond to the spouting water, reminiscent of [[gargoyle]] fountains.&lt;ref name=Artropolis/&gt;&lt;ref name=CDoCA/&gt; &lt;!-- I can not find a source to back up this claim: A remote control system, designed by multimedia consultants [[Shen Milsom &amp; Wilke]] synchronizes images, water flow, and lighting color and intensity. --&gt;Each face is cropped so that no hair and usually no ears are visible.&lt;ref name=MFHtMPfdeadcSHFahocCtpotaatm/&gt; Since there is no tripod designed for cameras turned on their sides,&lt;ref name=s85/&gt; an adjustable barber/dentist's chair was used to minimize the need for the movement of the state-of-the-art camera during filming.&lt;ref name=Hystf/&gt;&lt;ref name=MFHtMPfdeadcSHFahocCtpotaatm/&gt; Nonetheless, in some case, digital manipulation was necessary to properly simulate puckering in the exact proper location on the video.&lt;ref name=BSBDBA/&gt;  Many of the faces had to be stretched in order to get the mouths properly positioned.&lt;ref name=MFHtMPfdeadcSHFahocCtpotaatm/&gt;  Additionally, each video was color-corrected for brightness, contrast and color saturation.  Both the playback equipment and the final videos had to be further adjusted to account for sunlight during viewing.&lt;ref name=MFHtMPfdeadcSHFahocCtpotaatm/&gt;

After two architectural firms refused the contract to make Plensa's design a reality, the firm [[Krueck and Sexton Architects]] accepted. Public art was a departure from Krueck &amp; Sexton's residential and corporate office-dominated portfolio, which includes buildings like the [[Spertus Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Baeb, Eddie |date= September 7, 2007 |title = No Small Plans for Design Duo |journal = [[Crain's Chicago Business]] |volume = 30 |issue = 28 |pages = 1–8 |issn = 0149-6956}}&lt;/ref&gt; Collaboration between the artist, architectural team, and consultants proved to be crucial to the success of the project.  The fountain's black granite reflecting pool measures {{convert|48|by|232|ft|m}} and has an approximate water depth of {{convert|0.25|in|mm}}.&lt;ref name=Artropolis/&gt;  It displays videos on two [[LED]] screens, each encapsulated in a glass brick tower measuring {{convert|50|by|23|by|16|ft|m}}.&lt;ref name=Artropolis/&gt; &lt;!-- This would be a good place to insert the distance between towers - is it 232 feet? --&gt;The firm designed a special [[stainless steel]] T-frame both to bear the load of the walls, which are {{convert|50|ft|m}} high, and to withstand lateral wind forces.

After several dozen glass manufacturing firms were interviewed, L. E. Smith Glass Company emerged as the company to produce 22,500&amp;nbsp;glass blocks near the upper limit of the size of press glass formed from hand-poured molten glass and [[cast iron]] molds.&lt;ref name=s75&gt;Sharoff, 75&lt;/ref&gt;  The process used sand and [[soda ash]] heated to a temperature of {{convert|2600|F|C}} and "gathered" with a large clay ball resembling a [[honey dipper]]. Rather than use a standard plunger to ensure the glass that sagged off the rod spread to the corners of the mold, they relied on gravity.  The full mold was [[Annealing (glass)|annealed]] (reheated in an oven to {{convert|1100|F|C}}) and cooled.&lt;ref name=s76&gt;Sharoff, 76&lt;/ref&gt;  Over the course of four months of production,&lt;ref name=s79&gt;Sharoff, p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; about 350 blocks were produced per day.&lt;ref name=s76/&gt;

The glass was custom-made at a factory in [[Mount Pleasant, Pennsylvania]], and shipped to the structural glass panel manufacturer in Melbourne, Florida.  The panels were then shipped by truck to Chicago. The glass is white glass, rather than the usual green glass that results from [[iron]] impurities. This has the tradeoff of increased image clarity, but greater dirt visibility. Each block is {{convert|5|by|10|by|2|in|mm}} with glass thin enough to avoid image distortion. On each block, one of the six faces is polished, and the other five surfaces are textured.&lt;ref name=AT/&gt;&lt;ref name=awdoa/&gt;

The structure for the blocks was a challenge.  At first, the design team had considered switching to plastic blocks, until the team found Circle Redmont Inc., a prefabricated glass panel company in [[Melbourne, Florida|Melbourne]], Florida which specializes in structural glass panel systems.  Circle Redmont came up with the plan of turning grates on their sides to be used as building elements.&lt;ref name=s79/&gt; The individual grids are {{convert|5|ft|m}} tall and either {{convert|16|ft|m}} or {{convert|23|ft|m}} wide with cell capacity of an average of 250 blocks.&lt;ref name=s79/&gt;  Each tower is composed of 44 grids stacked and welded.&lt;ref name=s79/&gt;  The combination of the [[refraction]] of the glass and the thinness of the metal make the grid virtually invisible.&lt;ref name=s79/&gt;

The fountain uses {{convert|11000|impgal|L}} per hour, 97% of which is recycled back into the system.&lt;ref name=s86&gt;Sharoff, p. 86&lt;/ref&gt;  Getting the water to the spout took ingenuity. Although consideration was given to omitting a LED tile, it was determined that the images would then look as though they were each missing a tooth. Instead, one tile in each tower is recessed about {{convert|6|in|mm}} to allow the installation of {{convert|1|in|mm}} clear tubing for the water nozzle.&lt;ref name=AT/&gt; The water regularly spills over the fountain and down the sides of the towers and intermittently spouts from the nozzle.&lt;ref name=AT/&gt; Two essential custom fittings contribute to the artistic vision of the fountain: a custom glass block at the upper edge for guiding the water's descent while remaining unobtrusive, and a plastic nozzle fitted to the stainless steel frame to control the rate of water flow and reduce liability to the city for any injuries sustained by the fountain's interactive participants.&lt;ref name=G291/&gt;&lt;ref name=awdoa /&gt; The interactive participants are usually children playing in the stream from the water spout or under the cascade.&lt;ref name=NSaHHTD/&gt; The risk that the spouting water would knock people down made the design both a legal and a physical challenge.&lt;ref name=awdoa /&gt;

The fountains use over one million LEDs.&lt;ref name=G277&gt;Gilfoyle, p. 277.&lt;/ref&gt;  The inner surface of each tower uses 147 smaller screens with a total of 264,480 LED points (each with two red, one blue and two green LEDs).&lt;ref name=s82&gt;Sharoff, p. 82&lt;/ref&gt; The physical demands of LED screens, in particular the red, green, and blue long-life light bulbs and the requisite [[circuitry]], created three major challenges: supporting the physical structure, combating heat buildup, and optimizing perceptibility of the display.&lt;ref name=awdoa /&gt;  Plensa had used LED fixtures on previous projects, and thus had some experience with these issues.&lt;ref name=CsCFuLlad/&gt;  The LED structure is not supported as a single wall (which would be {{convert|50|ft|m}} high), but rather as several segments that are noticeable as visible horizontal bands every few feet: these show where the LED equipment is supported. The heat generated is handled by fans that cool the air at the bottom, that then works its way through the chimney-like tower. Perceptibility was determined to be optimal with [[LED lights]] {{convert|2|in|mm}} behind the glass.&lt;ref name=awdoa /&gt;

LEDs were chosen because they were viewed as the lowest maintenance option of the possible color changing fixtures.&lt;ref name=CsCFuLlad/&gt; LEDs fit into an electrical circuit, causing illumination by the movement of [[electron]]s in the [[semiconductor]] material and making a [[Electrical filament|filament]] unnecessary, so the bulbs never burn out and do not get too hot.  Fins were added to the screens to keep direct sunlight from hitting the LEDs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://twistedphysics.typepad.com/cocktail_party_physics/2007/08/park-walk-par-1.html|title=A Walk in the Park: Part III|work=Architecture, Art, Optics|publisher=Cocktail Party Physics|accessdate=December 18, 2007|date=August 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Color Kinetics (now part of [[Philips Solid-State Lighting Solutions]], which is now called Philips Color Kinetics)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://origin.newscenter.philips.com/about/news/article-15801.page |title=Philips to acquire Color Kinetics to strengthen leading position in Led lighting systems, components and technologies |accessdate=July 27, 2008 |date=June 19, 2007 |publisher=Koninklijke Philips Electronics N.V. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20090306082618/http://origin.newscenter.philips.com/about/news/article-15801.page |archivedate=March 6, 2009 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; ColorBlast&amp;nbsp;12 LEDs  fixtures are used to illuminate the tower structures and glass in an attempt to meet Plensa's objective that the towers have a light and translucent appearance, with their internal structures reflecting light from behind the glass surface.  The electronics were designed to be adaptable to the time of day, weather and season and to meet the desired century-long longevity and dependability objectives set by the design team in response to the thirty-year directive.&lt;ref name=CsCFuLlad/&gt;

During construction the underground parking garage remained open.&lt;ref&gt;Sharoff, p. 70&lt;/ref&gt; An additional challenge was designing the structure to facilitate interior access for ongoing maintenance and repairs, while accommodating two levels of underground parking underneath. The challenge was solved by combining a T-bar grid to absorb weight with about 150&amp;nbsp;"outriggers", or "tiebacks", inserted through the video wall to support the glass blocks and absorb wind loads. This design allows for the removal of individual glass blocks for cleaning or repair without disruption to the display. The filtered air inside the towers helps minimize the need for cleaning.&lt;ref name=AT/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=December 2006 |title = A Technical Cocktail |journal = Glass Age |volume = 49 |issue = 12 |pages = 15 |issn = 0017-0992}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Crown Fountain'''s design not only included interior access for technical repairs, but also incorporated exemplary, non-discriminatory, [[barrier-free]] accessibility, because its interactivity is not limited to the able-bodied.

===Operation===
The control center for the synchronization of images, water flow, and lighting color and intensity is beneath one of the towers, in a room that covers {{convert|550|sqft|m2}}. The room houses [[high-definition video]] servers and equipment temperature sensors. Hard drives contain all the individual electronic computer files of the face videos. Generally, the computer programs automatically perform tasks such as determining when the face will pucker and, if weather conditions permit, when to turn the water on and off. Using low- rather than high-[[Image resolution|resolution]] images was both less expensive and created a better display for the average viewer.&lt;ref name=AT/&gt; A [[Barco (manufacturer)|Barco]] [[show control]]ler selects the sequence of faces one at a time and determines a random tower lighting selection of one of eight LED colors programmed into an [[Electronic Theatre Controls]] (ETC) Emphasis control system.&lt;ref name=CsCFuLlad/&gt;  At night, the ETC system controls [[Stage lighting|spotlight]]s that illuminate the cascading water and that are dimmed by special wet-use location [[ground fault circuit interrupter]]s.&lt;ref name=CsCFuLlad/&gt;  The control room covers an area equal to 26&amp;nbsp;parking spaces in the underground parking garage, which costs the city $100,000 annually in terms of the [[opportunity cost]] of lost revenue (in 2004&amp;nbsp;dollars).&lt;ref name=BSBDBA&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/18/arts/art-architecture-big-shoulders-big-donors-big-art.html|title= Big Shoulders, Big Donors, Big Art|accessdate=June 1, 2008|date=July 18, 2004|author=Bernstein, Fred A.|publisher=The New York Times Company|work=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maintenance issues for the fountain range from kids removing the adhesive between the bricks to pipes in need of maintenance.&lt;ref name=AitaCFrawoq/&gt;  {{Asof|2014}}, annual upkeep costs were approximately $400,000.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; Typically, the fountain's water features function between mid-spring and mid-fall, but the images remain on the screen year-round.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://urbanmatter.com/chicago/crown-fountain-reopens/ |title=Play In The Spray: Crown Fountain Reopens Mid-April|accessdate= Mar 7, 2017 |author=Quero, Sam}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Video sculpture====
The  front face of each tower is [[animation|animated]] with a continuous, dynamic exhibit of lights and electronic images.&lt;ref name=Artropolis/&gt; Although the screens on the towers periodically display clips of [[landscape]]s such as  waterfalls,  most intriguing  are the display of faces of Chicago residents. About 1,000&amp;nbsp;faces of Chicagoans are shown in a random rotation,&lt;ref name=AT/&gt; the order determined using a Barco show controller.&lt;ref name=CsCFuLlad/&gt; Each face is displayed for five minutes, with a brief period between each of these videos during which the sculpture is unlit.  As a result, no more than 12 faces appear per hour during the summer.  However, during the winter a version without the final one minute of puckering is shown, so the video segments then are only four minutes each.&lt;ref name=Hystf/&gt;&lt;ref name=MFHtMPfdeadcSHFahocCtpotaatm/&gt;  The video pattern also includes a three-minute water scene every half-hour and a 30-second fade-to-black every 15 minutes.  If all the faces were shown consecutively, instead of randomly, they would each appear about once every eight days.&lt;ref name=Hystf/&gt; A June 2007 article in the ''Chicago Sun-Times'' reported that many of the subjects who had their images [[digital image|digitized]] for the project had yet to either see their own images or hear of anyone who had seen them.&lt;ref name=Hystf/&gt;

[[Image:20070616 Crown Fountain (6).JPG|thumb|left|Every 15 minutes the LEDs fade to black and there is a brief pause between individual videos.|alt=The fountain during a periodic fade to black]]
The spouting water from the  faces of the towers appears to be flowing from the displayed subject's mouth from a {{convert|6|in|mm|adj=on}} nozzle located in the center of each interior face {{convert|12|ft|m}} above the reflecting pool.&lt;ref name=MFHtMPfdeadcSHFahocCtpotaatm/&gt; Images are shown daily year-round, while the water feature only operates from May 1 to approximately October 31,&lt;ref name="Frequently Asked Questions"/&gt; weather permitting.&lt;ref name=CDoCA&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.millenniumpark.org/artandarchitecture/crown_fountain.html |accessdate=June 13, 2007 |publisher=Chicago Department of Cultural Affairs |title=The Crown Fountain |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070608095149/http://www.millenniumpark.org/artandarchitecture/crown_fountain.html &lt;!--Added by H3llBot--&gt; |archivedate=June 8, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The park is open to the public daily from 6&amp;nbsp;a.m. to 11&amp;nbsp;p.m.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.millenniumpark.org/generalinformation/|accessdate=August 3, 2008|publisher=City of Chicago|title=Millennium Park: General Information|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080730174640/http://www.millenniumpark.org/generalinformation/ &lt;!--Added by H3llBot--&gt;|archivedate=July 30, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each tower is illuminated from within on three sides by approximately 70&amp;nbsp;color-changing [[Color Kinetics]] LED lighting fixtures per tower, while the fourth side features opposing Barco LED display screens.  At night, some of the videos are replaced by images of nature or solid colors.&lt;ref name=CsCFuLlad&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ledsmagazine.com/features/2/5/3|title=Chicago's stunning Crown Fountain uses LED lights and displays|accessdate=March 18, 2008|date=May 2005|publisher=PennWell Corporation|work=LEDs Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also at night, the other three sides of the fountain display changing colors.&lt;ref name=G277/&gt;  The outer Color Kinetics surfaces randomly display the [[translucent]] glow of one of eight colors along with each of the inner opposing faces.&lt;ref name=CsCFuLlad/&gt;  As a [[video sculpture]] with a variety of cascade and water spout fountain modes, the sculpture is a fluid, dynamic evolving artwork.&lt;ref name=G291/&gt;

==Controversies==
Before the fountain was completed in 2004, Art Institute of Chicago president James Wood felt the columns would be too tall and other community leaders felt that the height and scale of the project stemmed from a "pissing contest" with other park feature artists.&lt;ref name=G290-1&gt;Gilfoyle, pp. 290–291.&lt;/ref&gt; Grant Park has been protected since 1836 by "forever open, clear and free" legislation that has been affirmed by four previous [[Illinois Supreme Court]] rulings.&lt;ref name=IafoGPCmfasr&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.economist.com/world/unitedstates/displaystory.cfm?story_id=9905732|title=In a fight over Grant Park, Chicago's mayor faces a small revolt |accessdate=July 31, 2008|date=October 4, 2007|publisher= The Economist Newspaper Limited|work=[[The Economist]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CSTB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=121435C3FB5CE640&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=AA98CDC331574F0ABEAFF732B33DC0B2|title=Mayor gets what he wants&amp;mdash;Council OKs move 33&amp;ndash;16 despite opposition|accessdate=July 29, 2008|date=June 12, 2008|publisher=Newsbank|work=Chicago Sun-Times|author=Spielman, Fran}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CTRB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=1212F083B836ABB8&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=AA98CDC331574F0ABEAFF732B33DC0B2|title=The taking of Grant Park|accessdate=July 29, 2008|date=June 8, 2008|publisher=Newsbank|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CSTB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=120B5E8D060726E0&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=AA98CDC331574F0ABEAFF732B33DC0B2|title=13&amp;ndash;2 vote for museum&amp;mdash;Decision on Grant Park sets up Council battle|accessdate=July 29, 2008|date=May 16, 2008|publisher=Newsbank|work=Chicago Sun-Times|author=Spielman, Fran and Art Golab}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aaron Montgomery Ward]] twice sued the city of Chicago in the 1890s to force it to remove buildings and structures from Grant Park, and to keep it from building new ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/538.html|title=Grant Park|accessdate=July 28, 2008|year=2005|work=The Electronic Encyclopedia of Chicago|publisher=[[Chicago Historical Society]]|author=Grinnell, Max}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result, the city has what are termed the Montgomery Ward height restrictions on buildings and structures in Grant Park.  However, ''Crown Fountain'' and [[Jay Pritzker Pavilion]], which stands {{convert|139|ft|m}} tall, were exempt from the height restriction because they were classified as [[Work of art|works of art]] and not buildings or structures.&lt;ref&gt;Gilfoyle, p. 181&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2006, ''Crown Fountain'' became the focus of a public controversy when the city added [[surveillance camera]]s atop each tower. Purchased through a $52&amp;nbsp;million [[Department of Homeland Security]] [[Federal grants (USA)|grant]] to the Chicago area, the cameras were part of a surveillance system augmenting eight other cameras covering all of Millennium Park.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CTRB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=1162481DDCDD7720&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=AA98CDC331574F0ABEAFF732B33DC0B2| title=Artworks stand alone as cameras lose perch|accessdate=April 22, 2008|date=December 20, 2006|author=Janega, James|publisher=NewsBank|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city said the cameras, similar to those used throughout the city at high-crime areas and traffic intersections, were intended to remain on the towers for several months until permanent, less intrusive replacements were secured.&lt;ref name=ATWABS&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/28/us/28cameras.html|title=A Tempest When Art Became Surveillance|accessdate=April 12, 2008|date=December 28, 2006|author=Sander, Libby|publisher=The New York Times Company|work=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; City officials had consulted the architects who collaborated with Plensa on the tower designs, but Plensa himself had not been notified.&lt;ref name=Janega&gt;{{cite web|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CTRB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=1161F38C6FC15398&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=AA98CDC331574F0ABEAFF732B33DC0B2| title=Now the Giant Faces Really are Watching|accessdate=April 22, 2008|date=December 19, 2006|author=Janega, James|publisher=NewsBank|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Public reaction was negative, as bloggers and the artistic community decried the cameras on the towers as inappropriate and a blight.&lt;ref name=ATWABS/&gt;&lt;ref name=Janega/&gt;  The city said that the cameras were largely for security reasons, but also partly to help park officials monitor burnt-out lights.&lt;ref name=Janega/&gt; The ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' quickly published an article concerning the cameras as well as the public reaction, and the cameras were removed the next day. Plensa supported their removal.&lt;ref name=ATWABS/&gt;

==Updating==
In 2014, the hardware and software behind the fountain's operation were replaced. At the time there were plans to replace LED lighting with [[incandescent bulb]]s on each of the non-video display surfaces and to replace the video surface LEDs. Plensa, who maintained control of the video faces for the first two years of the fountain's operation, understands that future generations may wish to update the faces used in the rotation of videos to reflect changes in humanity going forward.&lt;ref name=AitaCFrawoq&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/crown-fountain-jaume-plensa-millennium-park-tenth-anniversary-1004-portraits/Content?oid=13887327|title=At its tenth anniversary, Crown Fountain remains a wellspring of questions|accessdate=October 8, 2015|date=June 11, 2014|work=[[Chicago Reader]]|author=Malooley, Jake}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, an additional 1000 faces were anticipated for 2016.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Inside artist Jaume Plensa's giant Millennium Park sculptures|url = http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/chi-jaume-plensa-heads-millennium-park-20140616-column.html|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|accessdate = October 7, 2015|date=June 16, 2014|author=Borrelli, Christopher}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One ''Chicago Tribune'' critic was not impressed with [[JumboTron]]-like art, although he conceded the participatory element reminded him in a positive way of the [[jungle gym]] element of the ''[[Chicago Picasso]]''.&lt;ref name=Ubepa/&gt;

The fountain is featured on the cover of Philip Jodidio's 2005 book, ''Architecture: Art''.  Although Plensa is considered to be a [[conceptual artist]], according to Jodidio, Plensa created a work whose architectural aspects are paramount.  Its location juxtaposed with the Historic Michigan Boulevard District's skywall highlights these aspects.  Jodidio considers the work to be a modernization of the gargoyle theme, and feels that the scale of the enlarged faces humanize the work and challenges the architecture.  The towers are an integral part of the skyline that have achieved rare permanence for contemporary art.&lt;ref name=J162&gt;Jodidio, p. 162&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19193">[[File:Eastern World.svg|thumb|275x275px|A world map highlighting the "[[Eastern world]]", defined as [[Asia]] or the "[[Far East]]", which consists of three overlapping cultural regions: [[East Asia]], [[South Asia]], and [[Southeast Asia]] (in green, orange, and blue, respectively)]]

In [[sociology]], the '''East–West dichotomy''' is the perceived difference between the [[Eastern world|Eastern]] and [[Western world|Western]] worlds. [[culture|Cultural]] rather than [[geography|geographical]] in division, the boundaries of East and West are not fixed, but vary according to the criteria adopted by individuals using the term. Historically, [[Asia]] (excluding Siberia) was regarded as the East, and [[Europe]] was regarded as the West. Today, the "West" usually refers to [[Australasia]], [[Europe]], and [[Americas|America]]. Used in discussing such studies as [[management]], [[economics]], [[international relations]], and [[linguistics]], the concept is criticized for overlooking regional [[hybridity]].

== Divisions ==
Conceptually, the boundaries are cultural, rather than geographical, as a result of which [[Australia]] is typically grouped in the 
West (despite being geographically in the east), while Islamic nations are, regardless of location, grouped in the East.&lt;ref name=Mestrovic&gt;{{cite book | last = Meštrovic | first = Stjepan | title = Balkanization of the West: The Confluence of Postmodernism and Postcommunism | publisher = [[Routledge]] | year = 1994 | isbn = 0-203-34464-2 | page = 61}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, there are a few Muslim-majority regions in Europe which do not fit this dichotomy.{{fact|date=November 2018}} The culture line can be particularly difficult to place in regions of cultural diversity such as [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], whose citizens may themselves identify as East or West depending on ethnic or religious background.&lt;ref name=Mestrovic/&gt; Further, residents of different parts of the world perceive the boundaries differently; for example, some European scholars define [[Russia]] as East, but most agree that it is the West's second complementary part,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.academia.edu/616571/Metaphorical_politics_Is_Russia_western&lt;/ref&gt; and Islamic nations regard it and other predominantly [[Christian]] nations as the West.&lt;ref name=Mestrovic/&gt; Another unanswered question is whether Siberia (North Asia) is "Eastern" or "Western."

==Historical contrast between East and West==
[[File:Reeve and Serfs.jpg|thumb|250px|Serfs in [[kingdom of England|feudal England]], c. 1310]]
[[File:Spisska nova ves...castle.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[Mongol invasion of Europe]] led to construction of mighty stone castles, such as [[Spiš Castle]], today in [[Slovakia]].]]
During the [[Middle Ages]], there were many different types of civilizations that were comparable in some ways, but contrast each other in other ways. The Eastern civilizations and empires of the West are not comparable because of [[social class]] system, the way of making money and leadership. Special jobs for the people caused the rift between the East and West to grow, it was the difference between [[feudalism]] and the Eastern social system, the difference between [[trade]] and [[agriculture]] and the difference between the stability of government. The West and the Eastern Civilizations are not only different because of where they are, but also because of their social class system, the way of making money and leadership.&lt;ref name=ganshof&gt;[[François Louis Ganshof]] (1944). ''Qu'est-ce que la féodalité''.  Translated into English by [[Philip Grierson]] as ''Feudalism'', with a foreword by [[F. M. Stenton]], 1st ed.: New York and London, 1952; 2nd ed: 1961; 3d ed: 1976.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[daily life]] of the common people in the West and the Eastern Civilizations differed greatly based on how their society was run, and what it was focused on. One of the major differences between the West and the Eastern Civilizations was feudalism and [[manorialism]].&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Jones, "The Rise and Fall of the Manorial System: A Critical Comment" ''The Journal of Economic History'' '''32'''.4 (December 1972:938–944) p. 938; a comment on D. North and R. Thomas, "The rise and fall of the manorial system: a theoretical model", ''The Journal of Economic History'' '''31''' (December 1971:777–803).&lt;/ref&gt; They both shaped the [[social hierarchy]] and the overall life of the common person in the East. The manorial system was set up with a lord at the top who owned a large amount of land. He had [[serfs]] and [[peasants]] that he employed, the peasants in exchange for the land they got, for working, paid a rent of crop to the lord. This feudal society was every man for himself and did not help in the expansion of a civilization.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Stubbs]]. ''The Constitutional History of England''. Oxford: 1875.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;G. McMullan and D. Matthews, ''Reading the medieval in early modern England'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2007), p. 231.&lt;/ref&gt;  

The [[social system]] of the West and East were different. [[Mongolia]] rose from [[nomad]]ic tribes united by [[Genghis Khan]]. He conquered much of the surrounding land and created a large empire. They would give the defenders a choice to either join them or die.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last = Saunders|first = John Joseph|title = History of the Mongol Conquests|year = 2001|publisher = University of Pennsylvania Press|location = Philadelphia|isbn = 0-8122-1766-7|orig-year = First published 1972}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This brutal mentality was shown when they conquered the vast majority of Asia and some of Europe and the Middle East. One thing that set the [[Tang dynasty]] of [[China]] apart was their increased social mobility. They had a series of tests that could be taken to better social status. Instead of the high-ranking positions being exclusively for the [[aristocrat]]s, they were easier for the poor to gain access to. In the West, it was harder to move up or down in the social classes, but in Eastern Civilizations, mobility was possible. In China, it was possible to move up in social status through tests and, in Mongolia it was possible to gain rank in the army through military skill because the society was based on its military prowess.&lt;ref name="Lewis2007"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Early Chinese Empires: Qin and Han|first=Mark Edward|last=Lewis|publisher=Belknap Press|location=London|year=2007|isbn=978-0-674-02477-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The West and the Eastern civilizations differed politically because the common people of the East were not always content with their leadership. While the West had many rulers in a short period of time, there was no [[Civil unrest|unrest]] with the people. Eastern civilizations had [[rebellion]]s and long gaps between rulers that caused unrest. In [[England]], there was a major war for the [[throne]] that lasted for almost a century. During a major war in the 14th and [[15th century]], England had many struggles for the throne that lead to much bloodshed. [[France]] also had problems in their government. Throughout all of this, England was still able to fight the French and almost win in the [[Hundred Years War]]. In Eastern civilizations the government was not always stable.&lt;ref&gt;H. Damico, J. B. Zavadil, D. Fennema, and K. Lenz, ''Medieval Scholarship: Philosophy and the arts: biographical studies on the formation of a discipline'' (Taylor &amp; Francis, 1995), p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt; In China, one of the deadliest events in human history occurred during the Tang dynasty. The [[An Lushan Rebellion]] was very bloody and shows the instability in the Chinese government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Turchin|first1=Peter|last2=Adams|first2=Jonathan M.|last3=Hall|first3=Thomas D | title = East-West Orientation of Historical Empires | journal = Journal of world-systems research|date=December 2006 |volume=12|issue=2 |page=222 |url =http://jwsr.pitt.edu/ojs/index.php/jwsr/article/view/369/381 |issn= 1076-156X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Economically, the West and the Eastern civilizations were drastically different because of how they acquired money. In China, one of the major economic factors was the trade. They were connected to Europe with the [[Silk Road]], this was a series of trade routes from [[East Asia]] to Europe. The Silk Road was not only used to trade [[goods]], it was also a place for trading ways of thought or religion. The [[English people|English]] employed a special type of feudalism called [[bastard feudalism]].&lt;ref&gt;''Livery and Maintenance'', ''Encyclopedia of The Wars of the Roses'', ed. John A. Wagner, (ABC-CLIO, 2001), 145.&lt;/ref&gt; This type of feudalism, prominent in the [[War of the Roses]], was different from regular feudalism because it introduces money into the social hierarchy.&lt;ref name=ebo&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9034150/feudalism "Feudalism"], by [[Elizabeth A. R. Brown]]. ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica Online]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=halsall&gt;[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/sbook1i.html#Feudalism "Feudalism?"], by Paul Halsall. [[Internet Medieval Sourcebook]].&lt;/ref&gt;  Nobles could now pay their knights for their service in money instead of giving them land. This strengthened the feudal system because if there was a weak ruler, the strong government of the new nobles would support the people. The British nobles also created the [[Magna carta]] to reduce the kings power. This monetization of the class system changed how England was ruled and made it very different from the Eastern Civilizations.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080229034347/http://www.wku.edu/~rob.harbison/projects/Gfeudal.html "The Problem of Feudalism: An Historiographical Essay"], by Robert Harbison, 1996, [[Western Kentucky University]].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historical concepts ==
[[File:Modern Asia (1796).tif|thumb|245px|In the 1700s, the Eastern world comprised the continents of Asia and Australia ([[New Holland (Australia)|New Holland]]).]]
The concept has been used in both "Eastern" and "Western" nations. [[Japan|Japanese]] [[sinology|sinologist]] Tachibana Shiraki, in the 1920s, wrote of the need to unify Asia&amp;mdash;[[East Asia]], [[South Asia]] and [[Southeast Asia]] but excluding [[Central Asia]] and the [[Middle East]]&amp;mdash;and form a "New East" that might combine culturally in balancing against the West.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Li | first= Lincoln | title = The China factor in Modern Japanese thought: the case of Tachibana Shiraki, 1881-1945 | series = SUNY Series in Chinese Philosophy and Culture | publisher = [[SUNY Press]] | year = 1996 | isbn = 0-7914-3039-1 | pages = 104–105}}&lt;/ref&gt; Japan continued to make much of the concept, known as [[Pan-Asianism]], throughout [[World War II]], in [[propaganda]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Iriye | first = Akira | title = Global community: the role of international organizations in the making of the contemporary world | publisher = [[University of California Press]] | year = 2002 | isbn = 0-520-23127-9 | page = 87}}&lt;/ref&gt; In China, it was encapsulated during the [[Cold War]] in a 1957 speech by [[Mao Zedong]],&lt;ref name=Zedong&gt;{{cite book | last = Kau | first = John K. |author2=Leung | chapter = Notes | title = The Writings of Mao Zedong, 1949-1976: January 1956-December 1957 | volume = 2 | series = Writings of Mao Zedong | publisher = [[M.

To Western writers, in the 1940s, it became bound up with an idea of aggressive, "frustrated nationalism", which was seen as "intrinsically anti- or non-Western"; sociologist [[Frank Furedi]] wrote, "The already existing intellectual assessment of European nationalism adapted to the growth of the Third World variety by developing the couplet of mature Western versus immature Eastern nationalism.... This East-West dichotomy became an accepted part of Western political theory."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Füredi | first = Frank | title = Colonial wars and the politics of Third World nationalism | publisher = I.B.Tauris | year = 1994 | pages = 115–116}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The 1978 book ''[[Orientalism (book)|Orientalism]]'', by [[Edward Said]], was highly influential in further establishing concepts of the East–West dichotomy in the Western world, bringing into college lectures a notion of the East as "characterized by religious sensibilities, familial social orders, and ageless traditions" in contrast to Western "rationality, material and technical dynamism, and individualism."&lt;ref name=Barnett&gt;{{cite book | last = Barnett | first= Suzanne Wilson |author2=Van Jay Symons | title = Asia in the undergraduate curriculum: a case for Asian studies in liberal arts education | series = East Gate | publisher = M.E. Sharpe | year = 2000 | isbn = 0-7656-0546-5 | page = 99}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, the divide has also been posited as an Islamic "East" and an American and European "West."&lt;ref&gt;Meštrovic, 63.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also {{cite book | last = Chahuán | first = Eugenio | chapter = An East-West dichotomy: Islamophobia | title = Islamophobia and anti-Semitism | series = A Palestine-Israel Journal Book | editor1-last = Schenker | editor1-first=Hillel | editor2-last = Ziad | editor2-first = Abu Zayyad | publisher = Markus Wiener Publishers | year = 2006 | isbn = 1-55876-403-8 | pages = 25–32}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics note that an Islamic/non-Islamic East–West dichotomy is complicated by the global dissemination of [[Islamic fundamentalism]] and by cultural diversity within Islamic nations, moving the argument "beyond that of an East-West dichotomy and into a tripartite situation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Khatib | first = Lina | title = Filming the modern Middle East: politics in the cinemas of Hollywood and the Arab world | volume = 57 | series = Library of Modern Middle East Studies, Library of International Relations | publisher = [[I.B. Tauris]] | year = 2006 | isbn = 1-84511-191-5 | pages = 166–167, 173}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==
The East–West dichotomy has been used in studying a range of topics, including management, economics and linguistics. ''Knowledge Creation and Management'' (2007) examines it as the difference in [[organizational learning]] between [[Western culture]]s and the [[Eastern world]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Knowledge creation and management: new challenges for managers | last = Ichijō | first = Kazuo |author2=Ikujirō Nonaka | publisher = Oxford University Press US | year = 2007 | isbn = 0-19-515962-4 | page = 280}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been widely used in exploring the period of rapid economic growth that has been termed the "East-Asian miracle" in segments of [[East Asia]], particularly the [[Four Asian Tigers|Asian Tigers]], following [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Norberg | first = Johan | title = In defense of global capitalism | publisher = Cato Institute | year = 2003 | isbn = 1-930865-46-5 | page = 99}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some sociologists, in line with the West as a model of [[modernity]] posited by [[Arnold J. Toynbee]], have perceived the economic expansion as a sign of the "[[Westernization]]" of the region, but others look for explanation in cultural/racial characteristics of the East, embracing concepts of fixed Eastern cultural identity in a phenomenon described as "New Orientalism".&lt;ref name=Mestrovic/&gt;&lt;ref name=Berger&gt;{{cite book| last = Berger | first = Mark T. | chapter = The triumph of the East? The East-Asian Miracle and post-Cold War capitalism | title = The rise of East Asia: critical visions of the Pacific century | editor1-last = Borer | editor1-first = Douglas A. | publisher = Routledge | year = 1997 | isbn = 0-415-16168-1 | pages = 260–261, 266}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both approaches to the East-West dichotomy have been criticized for failing to take into account the historical [[hybridity]] of the regions.&lt;ref&gt;Berger, 275.&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept has also been brought to bear on examinations of [[intercultural communication]]. Asians are widely described as embracing an "inductive speech pattern" in which a primary point is approached indirectly, but Western societies are said to use "deductive speech" in which speakers immediately establish their point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Cheng | first = Winnie | title= Intercultural conversation | volume = 118 | series = Pragmatics &amp; Beyond | publisher = [[John Benjamins Publishing Company]] | year = 2003 | isbn = 90-272-5360-9 | page = 51}}&lt;/ref&gt; That is attributed to a higher priority among Asians in harmonious interrelations, but Westerners are said to prioritize direct communication.&lt;ref&gt;Cheng, 53.&lt;/ref&gt; 2001's ''Intercultural Communication: A Discourse Approach'' described the East–West dichotomy linguistically as a "false dichotomy", noting that both Asian and Western speakers use both forms of communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Scollon | first = Ronald | title= Intercultural communication: a discourse approach | volume = 21 | series= Language in Society | edition = 2 | publisher = Wiley-Blackwell | year = 2001 | isbn = 0-631-22418-1 | pages = 94–95}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
In addition to difficulties in defining regions and overlooking hybridity, the East–West dichotomy has been criticized for creating an artificial construct of regional unification that allows one voice to claim authority to speak for multitudes. In "The Triumph of the East?", Mark T. Berger speaks to the issue as relates to examination of the "East-Asian miracle": 
&lt;blockquote&gt;The historical power of the East-West dichotomy, and the fixed conceptions of culture/race to which it is linked, have increasingly allowed the national elites of the region to speak not only for their 'nations,' but even for Asia and Asians.... There are numerous instances of Western scholars, intent on challenging North American and/or Western hegemony in both material and discursive terms, ending up uncritically privileging the elite narratives of power-holders in Asia as authentic representatives of a particular non-Western nation or social formation (and also contributing to the continued use of the East-West dichotomy).&lt;ref&gt;Berger, 276&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3176">'''Embourgeoisement''' is the theory that posits the migration of individuals into the [[bourgeoisie]] as a result of their own efforts or collective action, such as that taken by unions in the US and elsewhere in the 1930s to the 1960s{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} that established middle class status for factory [[workers]] and others that would not have been considered middle class by their employments, allowing increasing numbers of what might traditionally be classified as working-class people to assume the lifestyle and individualistic values of the so-called middle classes and hence reject commitment to collective social and economic goals. The opposite process is [[proletarianization]]. Sociologist [[John Goldthorpe]] disputed the embourgeoisement thesis in 1967.

describes this change to be a result of the  post-industrialization of society, in which there are far fewer manual labor jobs, which is the main classification of blue-collar work.  With post-industrialization, former upper-level blue-collar workers are moving to white-collar work because of the decreased availability and prestige of manual labor jobs.  Even when their actual jobs do not change, their lifestyles based on their job situation often change into a lifestyle that according to Mayer and Buckley, more closely resembles the lower-middle class than the rest of the lower blue-collar workers.  The result of this idea of embourgeoisement is that more people are incorporated into the middle-class.  As a result, there is decreased [[class consciousness]] and declining working class solidarity

.  This in turn could lead to less group action among the lower class if trying to get more rights or changes within their job field. 
The topic was widely discussed in academic circles in the 1960s following the publication of ''The Affluent Worker in the Class Structure'' {{ISBN|0-521-09533-6}} by [[John H. Goldthorpe]] in 1963.

The situation in [[Great Britain]] at the time is described in the book ''Must Labour Lose?'', written by [[Mark Abrams]] and [[Richard Rose (political scientist)|Richard Rose]].

The '''fact–value distinction''' is the distinction between things that can be known to be true and things that are the personal preferences of individuals.

==David Hume's skepticism==
The fact–value distinction emerged in [[philosophy]] in the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]. In particular, [[David Hume]] (1711–1776) argued that human beings are unable to ground normative arguments in positive arguments, that is, to derive [[is–ought problem|''ought'' from ''is'']]. Hume was a [[skeptic]], and although a complex and dedicated philosopher, he shared a political viewpoint with early Enlightenment [[philosophers]] such as [[Thomas Hobbes]] (1588–1679) and [[John Locke]] (1632–1704). Specifically, Hume, at least to some extent, argued that religious and national hostilities that divided European society were based on unfounded beliefs. In effect, Hume contended that such hostilities are not found in [[nature]], but are a human creation, depending on a particular time and place, and thus unworthy of mortal conflict.

==Naturalistic fallacy==
The fact–value distinction is closely related to the [[naturalistic fallacy]], a topic debated in ethical and [[moral philosophy]]. [[G. E. Moore]] believed it essential to all ethical thinking.&lt;ref&gt;Casimir Lewy 1965 - G.E. Moore on the naturalistic fallacy&lt;/ref&gt; However, contemporary philosophers like [[Phillipa Foot]] have called into question the validity of such assumptions. Others, such as Ruth Anna Putnam, argue that even the most "scientific" of disciplines are affected by the "values" of those who research and practice the vocation.&lt;ref&gt;Putnam, Ruth Anna. "Perceiving Facts and Values", ''[[Philosophy (journal)|Philosophy]]'' 73, 1998. {{JSTOR|3752124}}  This article as well as her earlier article, "Creating Facts and Values", ''Philosophy'' 60, 1985 {{JSTOR|3750998}}, examines how scientists may base their choice of investigations on their unexamined subjectivity, which undermines the objectivity of their hypothesis and findings&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Smart, J.C. "Ruth Anna Putnam and the Fact-Value Distinction", ''Philosophy'' 74, 1999.  {{JSTOR|3751844}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the difference between the naturalistic fallacy and the fact–value distinction is derived from the manner in which modern [[social science]] has used the fact–value distinction, and not the strict naturalistic fallacy to articulate new fields of study and create academic disciplines.

==Moralistic fallacy==
The fact–value distinction is also closely related to the [[moralistic fallacy]], an invalid inference of factual conclusions from purely evaluative premises. For example, an invalid inference "Because everybody ought to be equal, there are no innate genetic differences between people" is an instance of the moralistic fallacy. As for the naturalistic fallacy one attempts to move from an "is" to an "ought" statement, with the moralistic fallacy one attempts to move from an "ought" to an "is" statement.

==Nietzsche's table of values==
[[Friedrich Nietzsche]] (1844–1900) in ''[[Thus Spoke Zarathustra]]'' said that a table of values hangs above every great people. Nietzsche points out that what is common among different peoples is the act of ''esteeming'', of creating values, even if the values are different from one people to the next. Nietzsche asserts that what made people great was not the content of their beliefs, but the act of valuing. Thus the values a community strives to articulate are not as important as the collective will to act on those values.&lt;ref&gt;Nietzsche, Friedrich. ''Thus Spoke Zarathustra''. Book Two "On the Virtuous": "You who are virtuous still want to be paid! Do you want rewards for virtue, and heaven for earth, and the eternal for your today? And now you are angry with me because I teach that there is no reward and paymaster? And verily, I do not even teach that virtue is its own reward."&lt;/ref&gt; The ''willing'' is more essential than the intrinsic worth of the goal itself, according to Nietzsche.&lt;ref&gt;Nietzsche, Friedrich. ''Thus Spoke Zarathustra''. Book Four "On Old and New Tablets": "To redeem what is past in man and to recreate all 'it was' until the will says, 'Thus I willed it! Thus I shall will it!' - this I called redemption and this alone I taught them to call redemption."&lt;/ref&gt; "A thousand goals have there been so far," says Zarathustra, "for there are a thousand peoples. Only the yoke for the thousand necks is still lacking: the one goal is lacking. Humanity still has no goal." Hence, the title of the aphorism, "On The Thousand And One Goals." The idea that one value-system is no more worthy than the next, although it may not be directly ascribed to Nietzsche, has become a common premise in modern social science. [[Max Weber]] and [[Martin Heidegger]] absorbed it and made it their own. It shaped their philosophical endeavor, as well as their political understanding.

==Criticisms==
Virtually all modern philosophers affirm ''some'' sort of fact–value distinction, insofar as they distinguish between science and "valued" disciplines such as [[ethics]], [[aesthetics]], or the fine [[arts]]. However, philosophers such as [[Hilary Putnam]] argue that the distinction between fact and value is not as absolute as Hume envisioned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reasonpapers.com/pdf/28/rp_28_9.pdf |title=The Collapse of the Fact/Value Dichotomy and Other Essays, Cambridge, MA : Harvard University Press, 2002 |author=Putnam, Hilary |publisher=Reasonpapers.com |accessdate=2013-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Philosophical [[pragmatists]], for instance, believe that true propositions are those that are ''useful'' or ''effective'' in predicting future (empirical) states of affairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/pragmatism/#PeiTruRea |title=Pragmatism (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy) |publisher=Plato.stanford.edu |date=2008-08-16 |accessdate=2013-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Far from being value-free, the pragmatists' conception of truth or facts directly relates to an end (namely, empirical predictability) that human beings regard as ''normatively'' desirable. Other thinkers reject an absolutist fact–value distinction by contending that our senses are imbued with prior conceptualizations, making it impossible to have any observation that is totally value-free, which is how Hume and the later [[Positivism|positivists]] conceived of facts.

=== Functionalist counterexamples ===
Several counterexamples have been offered by philosophers claiming to show that there are cases when an evaluative statement does indeed logically follow from a factual statement. [[Arthur Prior|A. N. Prior]] points out, from the statement "He is a sea captain," it logically follows, "He ought to do what a sea captain ought to do."&lt;ref&gt;[[Alasdair MacIntyre]], ''After Virtue'' (1984), p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alasdair MacIntyre]] points out, from the statement "This watch is grossly inaccurate and irregular in time-keeping and too heavy to carry about comfortably," the evaluative conclusion validly follows, "This is a bad watch."&lt;ref&gt;''ibid.'', p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Searle]] points out, from the statement "Jones promised to pay Smith five dollars," it logically follows that "Jones ought to pay Smith five dollars." The act of promising by definition places the promiser under obligation.&lt;ref&gt;Don MacNiven, ''Creative Morality'', pp. 41–42.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Moral realism ===
[[Philippa Foot]] adopts a [[Moral realism|moral realist]] position, criticizing the idea that when evaluation is superposed on fact there has been a "committal in a new dimension".&lt;ref&gt;Philippa Foot, “Moral Beliefs,” ''Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society'', vol. 59 (1958), pp. 83–104.&lt;/ref&gt;  She introduces, by analogy, the practical implications of using the word "injury". Not just anything counts as an injury. There must be some impairment. When we suppose a man wants the things the injury prevents him from obtaining, haven’t we fallen into the old naturalist fallacy?
{{quote|It may seem that the only way to make a necessary connexion between 'injury' and the things that are to be avoided, is to say that it is only used in an 'action-guiding sense' when applied to something the speaker intends to avoid. But we should look carefully at the crucial move in that argument, and query the suggestion that someone might happen not to want anything for which he would need the use of hands or eyes. Hands and eyes, like ears and legs, play a part in so many operations that a man could only be said not to need them if he had no wants at all.&lt;ref&gt;Foot 1958, p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Foot argues that the virtues, like hands and eyes in the analogy, play so large a part in so many operations that it is implausible to suppose that a committal in a non-naturalist dimension is necessary to demonstrate their goodness.
{{quote|Philosophers who have supposed that actual action was required if 'good' were to be used in a sincere evaluation have got into difficulties over weakness of will, and they should surely agree that enough has been done if we can show that any man has reason to aim at virtue and avoid vice. But is this impossibly difficult if we consider the kinds of things that count as virtue and vice? Consider, for instance, the cardinal virtues, prudence, temperance, courage and justice. Obviously any man needs prudence, but does he not also need to resist the temptation of pleasure when there is harm involved? And how could it be argued that he would never need to face what was fearful for the sake of some good? It is not obvious what someone would mean if he said that temperance or courage were not good qualities, and this not because of the 'praising' sense of these words, but because of the things that courage and temperance are.&lt;ref&gt;Foot 1958, p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7500">A '''first principle''' is a basic, foundational, self-evident [[proposition]] or assumption that cannot be deduced from any other proposition or assumption. In [[philosophy]], first principles are taught by [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelians]], and nuanced versions of first principles are referred to as [[postulate]]s by [[Kantian]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Vernon Bourke, ''Ethics'', (New York: The Macmillan Co., 1966), 14.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[mathematics]], first principles are referred to as [[axiom]]s or postulates. In physics and other sciences, theoretical work is said to be from first principles, or ''[[ab initio]]'', if it starts directly at the level of established science and does not make assumptions such as empirical model and parameter fitting.

==In formal logic==
In a formal [[logical system]], that is, a set of [[proposition]]s that are consistent with one another, it is [[Logical possibility|possible]] that some of the statements can be deduced from other statements. For example, in the [[syllogism]], ''"All men are mortal; Socrates is a man; Socrates is mortal"'' the last claim can be deduced from the first two.

A first principle is an [[Axiom#Mathematical logic#Logical axioms|axiom]] that cannot be deduced from any other within that system. The classic example is that of [[Euclid's Elements]]; its hundreds of geometric propositions can be deduced from a set of definitions, postulates, and common notions: all three types constitute first principles.

==Philosophy in general==
In philosophy "first principles" are also commonly referred to as ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' terms and arguments, which are contrasted to ''[[a posteriori]]'' terms, reasoning or arguments, in that the former are simply assumed and exist prior to the reasoning process and the latter are deduced or inferred after the initial reasoning process. First principles are generally treated in the realm of philosophy known as [[epistemology]], but are an important factor in any [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] speculation.  

In philosophy "first principles" are often somewhat synonymous with ''[[A priori knowledge|a priori]]'', datum and [[axiomatic reasoning]].

==Aristotle's contribution==
[[Terence Irwin]] writes:
{{quote|When Aristotle explains in general terms what he tries to do in his philosophical works, he says he is looking for "first principles" (or "origins"; archai):
:In every systematic inquiry (methodos) where there are first principles, or causes, or elements, knowledge and science result from acquiring knowledge of these; for we think we know something just in case we acquire knowledge of the primary causes, the primary first principles, all the way to the elements. It is clear, then, that in the science of nature as elsewhere, we should try first to determine questions about the first principles. The naturally proper direction of our road is from things better known and clearer to us, to things that are clearer and better known by nature; for the things known to us are not the same as the things known unconditionally (haplôs). Hence it is necessary for us to progress, following this procedure, from the things that are less clear by nature, but clearer to us, towards things that are clearer and better known by nature. (Phys. 184a10–21)
The connection between knowledge and first principles is not axiomatic as expressed in Aristotle's account of a first principle (in one sense) as "the first basis from which a thing is known" (Met. 1013a14–15). The search for first principles is not peculiar to philosophy; philosophy shares this aim with biological, meteorological, and historical inquiries, among others. But Aristotle's references to first principles in this opening passage of the Physics and at the start of other philosophical inquiries imply that it is a primary task of philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

==Descartes==
Profoundly influenced by [[Euclid]], [[Descartes]] was a [[rationalist]] who invented the [[foundationalist]] system of philosophy. He used the ''method of doubt'', now called [[Cartesian doubt]], to systematically doubt everything he could possibly doubt, until he was left with what he saw as purely indubitable truths. Using these self-evident propositions as his axioms, or foundations, he went on to deduce his entire body of knowledge from them. The foundations are also called ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' truths. His most famous proposition is "Je pense, donc je suis." (''I think, therefore I am'', or ''[[Cogito ergo sum]]'')

Descartes describes the concept of a first principle in the following excerpt from the preface to the ''[[Principles of Philosophy]]'' (1644):
{{quote|I should have desired, in the first place, to explain in it what philosophy is, by commencing with the most common matters, as, for example, that the word philosophy signifies the study of wisdom, and that by wisdom is to be understood not merely prudence in the management of affairs, but a perfect knowledge of all that man can know, as well for the conduct of his life as for the preservation of his health and the discovery of all the arts, and that knowledge to subserve these ends must necessarily be deduced from first causes; so that in order to study the acquisition of it (which is properly called [284] philosophizing), we must commence with the investigation of those first causes which are called Principles. Now these principles must possess two conditions: in the first place, they must be so clear and evident that the human mind, when it attentively considers them, cannot doubt of their truth; in the second place, the knowledge of other things must be so dependent on them as that though the principles themselves may indeed be known apart from what depends on them, the latter cannot nevertheless be known apart from the former. It will accordingly be necessary thereafter to endeavor so to deduce from those principles the knowledge of the things that depend on them, as that there may be nothing in the whole series of deductions which is not perfectly manifest.&lt;ref&gt;VOL I, Principles, Preface to the French edition. Author’s letter to the translator of the book which may here serve as a preface, p. 181&lt;/ref&gt; }}

==In physics==
In [[physics]], a calculation is said to be ''from first principles'', or ''[[ab initio]]'', if it starts directly at the level of established laws of physics and does not make assumptions such as empirical [[Physical model|model]] and [[Curve fitting|fitting]] parameters.

For example, calculation of [[electronic structure]] using [[Schrödinger's equation]] within a set of approximations that do not include fitting the model to experimental data is an [[ab initio quantum chemistry methods|''ab initio'' approach]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2252">The '''Frisch elasticity of labor supply''' captures the [[elasticity (economics)|elasticity]] of hours worked to the [[wage]] rate, given a constant [[marginal utility]] of wealth.

It is named after the economist [[Ragnar Frisch]].

Under certain circumstances, a constant marginal utility of wealth implies a constant marginal utility of consumption.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13091">'''Illusory conjunctions''' are psychological effects in which participants combine features of two objects into one object. There are [[visual]] illusory conjunctions, [[auditory illusion|auditory]] illusory conjunctions, and illusory conjunctions produced by combinations of visual and tactile stimuli. Visual illusory conjunctions are thought to occur due to a lack of visual spatial attention, which depends on fixation and (amongst other things) the amount of time allotted to focus on an object. With a short span of time to interpret an object, blending of different aspects within a region of the [[visual field]] – like shapes and colors – can occasionally be skewed, which results in visual illusory conjunctions. For example, in a study designed by [[Anne Treisman]] and Schmidt participants were required to view a visual presentation of numbers and shapes in different colors. Some shapes were larger than others but all shapes and numbers were evenly spaced and shown for just 200 ms (followed by a mask). When the participants were asked to recall the shapes they reported answers such as a ''small green triangle'' instead of a ''small green circle''. If the space between the objects is smaller, illusory conjunctions occur more often.

==Visual==

Along with [[feature integration]], the location of the perceived illusory object in vision is a combined result of the constituent objects' locations, but the similarity of the features is what increases the likelihood of an illusory conjunction.&lt;ref&gt;Hazeltine, R. E., Prinzmetal, W., &amp; Elliott, K. (1997). If it's not there, where is it? Locating illusory conjunctions. Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance, 23(1), 263-263-277. {{doi|10.1037/0096-1523.23.1.263}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order for an illusory conjunction to occur, the two objects that are not the focus of attention need to be within the visual field. The closer two objects are, the more likely the illusory conjunction is to occur.&lt;ref name="CohenIvry"&gt;Cohen, A., &amp; Ivry, R. (1989). Illusory conjunctions inside and outside the focus of attention. Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance, 15(4), 650-650-663. {{doi|10.1037/0096-1523.15.4.650}}&lt;/ref&gt; The increased likelihood of an illusory conjunction to occur when the objects are closer together may be due to a difference in processing compared with when the objects are more distant from each other. One theory supports that the decrease in illusory conjunctions with increased distance between objects is due to the use of bi-hemispheric input processing, making closer objects more likely to be conjoined because only one of the [[cerebral hemispheres]] sees and processes both objects that are involved in an illusory conjunction.&lt;ref&gt;Liederman, J. &amp; Sohn, Y. (1999). Presentation of words to separate hemispheres prevents interword illusory conjunctions. International Journal of Neuroscience, Vol 97(1-2), 1999, 1-16. {{doi|10.3109/00207459908994299}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although proximity increases the likelihood of an illusory conjunction, illusory conjunctions formed between objects can occur even when the objects are distant, though still within the attentional field. When objects are outside of attention in order for an illusory conjunction to occur they must be adjacent to each other to combine features.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, A., &amp; Ivry, R. B. (1991). Density effects in conjunction search: Evidence for a coarse location mechanism of feature integration. Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance, 17(4), 891-901. {{doi|10.1037/0096-1523.17.4.891}}&lt;/ref&gt; Objects become more susceptible to illusory conjunction not only due to relation to each other, but also in relation to the density of objects in the attentional location. As the density of objects increases, there is more division of attention, which increases the possibility of forming of an illusory conjunction.&lt;ref name="PCDTT"&gt;Pelli, D. G.,  Cavanagh, P., Desimone, R.,  Tjan, B.,  &amp; Treisman, A. (2007).  Crowding: Including illusory conjunctions, surround suppression, and attention.  Journal of Vision, Vol 7(2), 2007, 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternative theories==

It has been suggested that research in support of illusory conjunctions is not adequate in terms of the methods used to analyze the data. If this criticism were found to be true, it would support the theory that illusory conjunctions are only illusions and nothing more.&lt;ref&gt;Donk, M. (2001). Illusory conjunctions die hard: A reply to prinzmetal, diedrichsen, and irvy (2001). Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance, 27(3), 542-542-546. {{doi|10.1037/0096-1523.27.3.542}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been found in a few studies on visual illusory conjunctions that two objects that are not the focus of attention are also more likely to be combined when they are adjacent to each other. Although it would seem more common for objects to combine when they are not the focus of attention it is more likely for an illusory conjunction to occur when objects are the focus of attention.&lt;ref name="CohenIvry"/&gt; Visual illusory conjunctions can occur in long and brief exposure times along with the different levels of attention paid to the objects involved.&lt;ref&gt;Prinzmetal, W., Henderson, D., &amp; Ivry, R. (1995). Loosening the constraints on illusory conjunctions: Assessing the roles of exposure duration and attention. Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance, 21(6), 1362-1362-1375. {{doi|10.1037/0096-1523.21.6.1362}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Memory==

Illusory conjunctions can also occur in [[memory]]. In vision, images can be combined through a lapse in memory of an image that is filled by physical stimuli&lt;ref&gt;Craver-Lemley, C., Arterberry, M. E., &amp; Reeves, A. (1999). "Illusory" illusory conjunctions: The conjoining of features of visual and imagined stimuli. Journal of Experimenta Psychology: Human Perception and Performance, 25(4), 1036-1036-1049. {{doi|10.1037/0096-1523.25.4.1036}}&lt;/ref&gt; Illusory conjunctions often occur through memory errors because the situations in which illusory conjunctions happen involve multiple tasks or tasks that commonly divide a person's attention.&lt;ref&gt;Navon, D. &amp; Ehrlich, B. (1995). Illusory conjunctions: Does inattention really matter?" ''Cognitive Psychology'', Vol 29(1), Aug 1995, 59-83. {{doi|10.1006/cogp.1995.1012}}&lt;/ref&gt; While memory errors can aid in the formation of illusory conjunctions their formation is not dependent on memory errors.&lt;ref&gt;Treisman, A. &amp; Schmidt, H. (1982). Illusory conjunctions in the perception of objects" ''Cognitive Psychology'', Vol 14(1), Jan 1982, 107-141. {{doi|10.1016/0010-0285(82)90006-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; These memory errors can be caused by a multitude of objects in a space increases the amount of things to be processed and stored to memory increases. This increase in objects creates a prime situation for memory to lapse and form an illusory conjunction.&lt;ref name="PCDTT"/&gt; Illusory conjunctions in short term auditory memory occur also. When a set of tones is played in a sequence, illusory conjunctions of 'what' and 'when' can occur. For example, if a sequence of tones begins with the note C, and later includes the note C#,  and the note C# is repeated at the end of the sequence, there is a tendency for listeners to assume erroneously that this last note had also been the first note in the sequence.&lt;ref name="phil-27"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Deutsch, D. | title=Dislocation of Tones in a Musical Sequence: a Memory Illusion. | journal=Nature | volume=226 | pages=286 | year=1970 | doi=10.1038/226286a0 | issue=5242}} [http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v226/n5242/abs/226286a0.html Weblink] [http://deutsch.ucsd.edu/pdf/Nature-1970_226_p286.pdf PDF Document]&lt;/ref&gt; Illusory conjunctions of pitch and duration in tone sequences also occur.&lt;ref name="Thompson, W. F. 2001"&gt;Thompson, W. F., Hall, M. D., &amp; Pressing, J. (2001). Illusory conjunctions of pitch and duration in unfamiliar tone sequences.

==Auditory==

Auditory illusory conjunctions occur either when two sounds are presented in different positions in space, but a single sound is heard, or when two different sounds are presented in different positions in space, but some of them are heard in the wrong spatial location. In the [[octave illusion]], the listener is presented via earphones with a 20-second sequence consisting of two alternating tones that are an octave apart, and are repeatedly presented in alternation. The tones are 250 ms in duration.  The same sequence is presented to the two ears, but when the right ear receives the high tone the left ear receives the low tone, and vice versa. Most listeners hear this sequence as a single tone that repeatedly changes both in pitch and in location.&lt;ref name="phil-85"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Deutsch, D. | title=An auditory illusion | journal=Nature | volume=251 | pages=307–309 | year=1974 | pmid=4427654 | doi=10.1038/251307a0 | issue=5473}} [http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v251/n5473/abs/251307a0.html Weblink] [http://deutsch.ucsd.edu/pdf/Nature-1974_251_307-309.pdf PDF Document]&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that time limitations contribute to this auditory illusory conjunction&lt;ref name="Thompson, W.

Illusory conjunctions can also occur between vision and touch. This happens when a seen object is attributed to textures that someone is feeling. This phenomenon is also more common when only one of the cerebral hemispheres is perceiving and processing the visual and tactile stimuli.&lt;ref&gt;Cinel, C., Humphreys, G. W., &amp;  Poli, R.

In [[economics]], an '''input–output model''' is a quantitative economic technique that represents the interdependencies between different branches of a national economy or different regional economies.&lt;ref name="ref"&gt;Thijs Ten Raa, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=nu0FAvNiFhYC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Input–output economics: theory and applications: featuring Asian economies]'', World Scientific, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wassily Leontief]] (1906–1999) is credited with developing this type of analysis and earned the [[Nobel Prize in Economics]] for his development of this model.&lt;ref name="ref"/&gt;

==Origins==
[[Francois Quesnay]] had developed a cruder version of this technique called [[Tableau économique]], and [[Léon Walras]]'s work ''Elements of Pure Economics'' on [[general equilibrium theory]] also was a forerunner and made a generalization of Leontief's seminal concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Éléments d'économie politique pure, ou théorie de la richesse sociale |trans-title=Elements of Pure Economics, or The Theory of Social Wealth |first=L. |last=Walras |location= |publisher= |year=1874 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alexander Bogdanov]] has been credited with originating the concept in a report delivered to the [[First Conference on Scientific Organization of Labour|All Russia Conference on the Scientific Organisation of Labour and Production Processes]], in January 1921.&lt;ref name=Belykh&gt;{{cite journal|last=Belykh|first=A. A.|title=A Note on the Origins of Input-Output Analysis and the Contribution of the Early Soviet Economists: Chayanov, Bogdanov and Kritsman|journal=Soviet Studies|date=July 1989|volume=41|issue=3|pages=426–429|doi=10.1080/09668138908411823}}&lt;/ref&gt; This approach was also developed by L. N. Kritsman and T. F. Remington, who has argued that their work provided a link between Quesnay's tableau économique and the subsequent contributions by [[Vladimir Groman]] and [[Vladimir Bazarov]] to [[Gosplan]]'s method of [[material balance planning]].&lt;ref name=Belykh /&gt;

Wassily Leontief's work in the input-output model was influenced by the works of the classical economists [[Karl Marx]] and [[Jean Charles Léonard de Sismondi]]. Karl Marx's economics provided an early outline involving a set of tables where the economy consisted of two interlinked departments.&lt;ref name="Planning and the Real Origins of Input-Output Analysis, 1984"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Planning and the Real Origins of Input-Output Analysis |first=D. L. |last=Clark |year=1984 |journal=Journal of Contemporary Asia |volume=14 |issue=4 |pages=408–429 |doi=10.1080/00472338485390301 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leontief was the first to use a [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] representation of a national (or regional) economy.

== Basic derivation ==
The model depicts inter-industry relationships within an economy, showing how output from one industrial sector may become an input to another industrial sector. In the inter-industry matrix, column entries typically represent inputs to an industrial sector, while row entries represent outputs from a given sector. This format therefore shows how dependent each sector is on every other sector, both as a customer of outputs from other sectors and as a supplier of inputs. Each column of the input–output [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] shows the monetary value of inputs to each sector and each row represents the value of each sector's outputs.

Say that we have an economy with &lt;math&gt; n &lt;/math&gt; sectors. Each sector produces &lt;math&gt; x_i &lt;/math&gt; units of a single homogeneous good. Assume that the &lt;math&gt; j &lt;/math&gt;th sector, in order to produce 1 unit, must use &lt;math&gt; a_{ij} &lt;/math&gt; units from sector &lt;math&gt; i &lt;/math&gt;. Furthermore, assume that each sector sells some of its output to other sectors (intermediate output) and some of its output to consumers (final output, or final demand). Call final demand in the &lt;math&gt; i &lt;/math&gt;th sector &lt;math&gt; d_i &lt;/math&gt;. Then we might write

:&lt;math&gt;

x_i = a_{i1}x_1 + a_{i2}x_2 + \ldots + a_{in}x_n + d_i,

&lt;/math&gt;

or total output equals intermediate output plus final output. If we let &lt;math&gt; A &lt;/math&gt; be the matrix of coefficients &lt;math&gt; a_{ij} &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; x &lt;/math&gt; be the vector of total output, and &lt;math&gt; d &lt;/math&gt; be the vector of final demand, then our expression for the economy becomes

:&lt;math&gt;

x = Ax + d

&lt;/math&gt;

which after re-writing becomes &lt;math&gt; (I - A)x = d &lt;/math&gt;. If the matrix &lt;math&gt; I - A &lt;/math&gt; is invertible then this is a linear system of equations with a unique solution, and so given some final demand vector the required output can be found. Furthermore, if the principal [[Minor (linear algebra)|minors]] of the matrix &lt;math&gt; I - A &lt;/math&gt; are all positive (known as the [[Hawkins–Simon condition]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Nikaido |first=H. |title=Introduction to Sets and Mappings in Modern Economics |location=New York |publisher=Elsevier |year=1970 |isbn=0-444-10038-5 |pages=13–19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the required output vector &lt;math&gt; x &lt;/math&gt; is non-negative.

=== Example ===

Consider an economy with two goods, A and B. The matrix of coefficients and the final demand is given by

:&lt;math&gt;

A = \left(\begin{array}{cc} 0.5 &amp; 0.2 \\ 0.4 &amp; 0.1 \end{array}\right) \text{ and } d = \left(\begin{array}{c} 7 \\ 4 \end{array}\right).

&lt;/math&gt;

Intuitively, this corresponds to finding the amount of output each sector should produce given that we want 7 units of good A and 4 units of good B. Then solving the system of linear equations derived above gives us

:&lt;math&gt;

x = (I - A)^{-1} d = \left(\begin{array}{c} 19.19 \\ 12.97 \end{array}\right).

&lt;/math&gt;

=== Further research ===

There is an extensive literature on these models. There is the Hawkins–Simon condition on producibility. There has been research on disaggregation to clustered inter-industry flows, and on the study of constellations of industries. A great deal of empirical work has been done to identify coefficients, and data has been published for the national economy as well as for regions. The Leontief system can be extended to a model of general equilibrium; it offers a method of decomposing work done at a macro level.

=== Introducing transportation ===

Transportation is implicit in the notion of inter-industry flows. It is explicitly recognized when transportation is identified as an industry – how much is purchased from transportation in order to produce. But this is not very satisfactory because transportation requirements differ, depending on industry locations and capacity constraints on regional production. Also, the receiver of goods generally pays freight cost, and often transportation data are lost because transportation costs are treated as part of the cost of the goods.

[[Walter Isard]] and his student, [[Leon Moses]], were quick to see the spatial economy and transportation implications of input–output, and began work in this area in the 1950s developing a concept of interregional input–output. Take a one region versus the world case. We wish to know something about interregional commodity flows, so introduce a column into the table headed "exports" and we introduce an "import" row.

A more satisfactory way to proceed would be to tie regions together at the industry level. That is, we could identify both intra-region inter-industry transactions and inter-region inter-industry transactions. The problem here is that the table grows quickly.

Input–output is conceptually simple. Its extension to a model of equilibrium in the national economy has been done successfully using high-quality data. One who wishes to do work with input–output systems must deal skillfully with industry classification, data estimation, and inverting very large, ill-conditioned matrices. Moreover, changes in relative prices are not readily handled by this modeling approach alone. Of course, input–output accounts are part and parcel to a more flexible form of modeling, [[Computable general equilibrium]] models.

Two additional difficulties are of interest in transportation work. There is the question of substituting one input for another, and there is the question about the stability of coefficients as production increases or decreases. These are intertwined questions. They have to do with the nature of regional production functions.

==Usefulness==

Because the input–output model is fundamentally linear in nature, it lends itself to rapid computation as well as flexibility in computing the effects of changes in demand. Input–output models for different regions can also be linked together to investigate the effects of inter-regional trade, and additional columns can be added to the table to perform [[environmentally extended input-output analysis]] (EEIOA). For example, information on fossil fuel inputs to each sector can be used to investigate flows of embodied carbon within and between different economies.

The structure of the input–output model has been incorporated into national accounting in many developed countries, and as such can be used to calculate important measures such as national GDP. Input–output economics has been used to study regional economies within a nation, and as a tool for national and regional economic planning. A main use of input–output analysis is to measure the economic impacts of events as well as public investments or programs as shown by [[IMPLAN]] and [[Regional Input-Output Modeling System]]. It is also used to identify economically related industry clusters and also so-called "key" or "target" industries (industries that are most likely to enhance the internal coherence of a specified economy). By linking industrial output to satellite accounts articulating energy use, effluent production, space needs, and so on, input–output analysts&lt;!-- Who? --&gt; have extended&lt;!-- Font? --&gt; the approaches application to a wide variety of uses.

===Input-output and socialist planning===
The input-output model is one of the major conceptual models for a [[socialist]] [[planned economy]]. This model involves the direct determination of physical quantities to be produced in each industry, which is used to formulate a consistent economic plan of resource allocation. This method of planning is contrasted with price-directed [[Lange model|Lange-model socialism]] and Soviet-style [[material balance planning]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Loucks|first1=William Negele|last2=Whitney|first2=William G.|title=Comparative Economic Systems|date=1973|publisher=Harper &amp; Row|isbn=9780060440459|pages=178–179|edition=9th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the economy of the [[Soviet Union]], planning was conducted using the method of material balances up until the country's dissolution. The method of material balances was first developed in the 1930s during the Soviet Union's rapid industrialization drive. Input-output planning was never adopted because the material balance system had become entrenched in the Soviet economy, and input-output planning was shunned for ideological reasons. As a result, the benefits of consistent and detailed planning through input-output analysis was never realized in the [[Analysis of Soviet-type economic planning|Soviet-type economies]].&lt;ref&gt;''Towards A New Socialism'', 1993, by Paul cockshott and Allin Cottrell. Coronet Books Inc. 978-0851245454. "Planning in the USSR", (P.79)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Measuring input–output tables ==

The mathematics of input–output economics is straightforward, but the data requirements are enormous because the expenditures and revenues of each branch of economic activity have to be represented. As a result, not all countries collect the required data and data quality varies, even though a set of standards for the data's collection has been set out by the United Nations through its System of National Accounts (SNA):&lt;ref&gt;[http://unstats.un.org/unsd/nationalaccount/sna.asp About SNA], UN&lt;/ref&gt; the most recent standard is the 2008 SNA. Because the data collection and preparation process for the input–output accounts is necessarily labor and computer intensive, input–output tables are often published long after the year in which the data were collected—typically as much as 5–7 years after. Moreover, the economic "snapshot" that the benchmark version of the tables provides of the economy's cross-section is typically taken only once every few years, at best.

However, many developed countries estimate input–output accounts annually and with much greater recency. This is because while most uses of the input–output analysis focus on the matrix set of inter-industry exchanges, the actual focus of the analysis from the perspective of most national statistical agencies is the [[benchmarking]] of [[gross domestic product]]. Input–output tables therefore are an instrumental part of [[national accounts]]. As suggested above, the core input–output table reports only intermediate goods and services that are exchanged among industries. But an array of row [[vector (geometric)|vector]]s, typically aligned at the bottom of this matrix, record non-industrial inputs by industry like payments for labor; indirect business taxes; dividends, interest, and rents; capital consumption allowances (depreciation); other property-type income (like profits); and purchases from foreign suppliers (imports). At a national level, although excluding the imports, when summed this is called "gross product originating" or "gross domestic product by industry." Another array of column vectors is called "final demand" or "gross product consumed." This displays columns of spending by households, governments, changes in industry stocks, and industries on investment, as well as net exports. (See also Gross domestic product.) In any case, by employing the results of an economic census which asks for the sales, payrolls, and material/equipment/service input of each establishment, statistical agencies back into estimates of industry-level profits and investments using the input–output matrix as a sort of double-accounting framework.

==Input–output analysis versus consistency analysis==
Despite the clear ability of the input-output model to depict and analyze the dependence of one industry or sector on another, Leontief and others never managed to introduce the full spectrum of dependency relations in a market economy. In 2003, Mohammad Gani [https://web.archive.org/web/20070826172321/http://sb.iub.edu.bd/Dr_Mohammad_Osman_Gani.html], a pupil of Leontief, introduced [[consistency analysis]] in his book 'Foundations of Economic Science' ({{ISBN|984320655X}}), which formally looks exactly like the input–output table but explores the dependency relations in terms of payments and intermediation relations. Consistency analysis explores the consistency of plans of buyers and sellers by decomposing the input–output table into four matrices, each for a different kind of means of payment. It integrates micro and macroeconomics into one model and deals with money in a value-free manner. It deals with the flow of funds via the movement of goods.

Stern and Callahan had been members of the media art collective [[USCO]] in the 1960s when they had lived in [[Rockland County, New York]].&lt;ref name=Oren2010&gt;{{cite news|last=Oren|first=Michel|title=USCO: Getting Out of Your Head to Use Your Head|url=http://www.intermediafoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/ArtJournal_all_reduced.pdf|work=[[Art Journal (College Art Association journal)|Art Journal]]|date=Winter  2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Intermedia Systems Corporation produced [[multimedia]] art internationally during the 1970s.&lt;ref name=Stern2001&gt;{{cite web|last=Stern|first=Gerd|title=Oral History: From Beat Scene Poet to Psychedelic Multimedia Artist in San Francisco and Beyond, 1948-1978|url=http://content.cdlib.org/xtf/view?docId=kt409nb28g&amp;brand=oac&amp;doc.view=entire_text|publisher=[[The Bancroft Library]]|date=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Intermedia Systems Corporation history==
Gerd Stern was offered an Associate in Education faculty position at [[Harvard University]] by Harvard professor George Litwin, a former colleague of [[Timothy Leary]]'s. Stern moved with Michael Callahan to Cambridge, Massachusetts, where they used USCO equipment to begin their own company in cooperation with Litwin and other behavioral scientists affiliated with [[Harvard Business School]]. Stern and Callahan co-founded Intermedia Systems Corporation in 1969, the year the company handled some management and administrative details for the [[Woodstock festival]]. Intermedia Systems Corporation made pioneering hardware to control multi-channel audiovisual programming, and in the 1970s produced multimedia art internationally.&lt;ref name=Oren2010/&gt;&lt;ref name=Stern2001/&gt;&lt;ref name=Holland1999&gt;{{cite news|last=Holland|first=Roberta|title=Peace, love and interactive media|url=https://www.bizjournals.com/boston/stories/1999/03/01/smallb1.html|work=[[Boston Business Journal]]|date=1 May 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Youngblood1970&gt;{{cite web|last=Youngblood|first=Gene|title=The Artist as Ecologist (First published in ''Expanded Cinema'', P.

Intermedia Systems Corporation's approach to applied research in the arts was featured in Stewart Kranz’s 1974 anthology, ''Science and Technology in the Arts''. Litwin stated in the book, “We are trying to use mixed media—multimedia technology—to create environments that have particular kinds of psychological effects." Stern explained that the interdisciplinary company conducted experiments, and existed in the space between psychology, business, and art.&lt;ref name=Scott2015&gt;{{cite web|last=Scott|first=Felicity D.|title=Vanguards|url=http://www.e-flux.com/journal/64/60873/vanguards/|date=April 2015|publisher=''e-Flux''}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In 1974 Stern gave a talk on "the present state of communications systems and some possible directions for evolution," at a conference titled "Educational Communication Centers and the Television Arts."&lt;ref name="ETC O'Grady"&gt;{{cite web|title=Gerald O'Grady|url=http://www.experimentaltvcenter.org/gerald-ogrady|publisher=[[Experimental Television Center]]|accessdate=October 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conference was coordinated by Gerald O'Grady, and held at the [[University at Albany, SUNY|State University of New York in Albany]]. Grady was Director of the Center for Media Study at the [[University at Buffalo, The State University of New York|State University of New York in Buffalo]].&lt;ref name="ETC O'Grady"/&gt; In addition to pioneers of public television experiments, other presenters included video artists [[Steina and Woody Vasulka|Steina Vasulka, Woody Vasulka]], and [[Ed Emshwiller]], as well as composer [[Joel Chadabe]]. There was also a demonstration of one of [[Experimental Television Center]]'s [[video synthesizer|video synthesizers]].&lt;ref name="ETC Conference"&gt;{{cite web|title=Video Conference Held at Albany|url=http://www.experimentaltvcenter.org/video-conference-held-albany|publisher=[[Experimental Television Center]]|accessdate=October 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Callahan worked at Harvard University from 1977 until 1994, at the [[Carpenter Center for the Visual Arts|Carpenter Center for Visual Arts]]. He and his wife Adrienne co-founded Museum Technology Source in 1986. The company, based in [[Massachusetts]], initially made electronic devices that allowed museum patrons to use video and interactive exhibits.&lt;ref name=Holland1999/&gt;&lt;ref name="MTS"&gt;{{cite web|title=Welcome to Museum Technology Source|url=http://www.museumtech.com/about_us.htm|publisher=Museum Technology Source|accessdate=October 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Sexual violence]]''' includes, but is not limited to [[rape]]. Although there is no agreed upon definition of sexual violence, commonly applied ones encompass any act of a sexual nature or attempt to obtain a sexual act carried out through coercion. Sexual violence also includes physical and psychological violence directed at a person's sexuality, including unwanted comments or advances, or acts of traffic such as forced [[prostitution]] or [[sexual slavery]].&lt;ref&gt;[WHO (2002), 'Sexual violence', in World Report in violence and health, Chapter 6, pp. 149]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[Elements of Crimes, Article 7(1)(g)-6 Crimes against humanity of sexual violence, elements 1.

(1998), Special Rapporteur, Contemporary forms of slavery: systematic rape, sexual slavery and slavery-like practices during armed conflict, Final report submitted by Ms. Jay J. McDougall, Special Rapporteur, E/CN.4/Sub.2/1998/13, para. 21]&lt;/ref&gt;

Sexual violence, in times of peace and armed conflict situations, is widespread and considered to be one of the most traumatic, pervasive, and most common violations human beings suffer.&lt;ref name="Lindsey2001"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lindsey|first=Charlotte|title=Women facing war|year=2001|publisher=ICRC|location=Geneva|pages=57–61}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="icrc"&gt;{{cite web|title=Advancement of women: ICRC statement to the United Nations, 2013|url=http://www.icrc.org/eng/resources/documents/statement/2013/united-nations-women-statement-2013-10-16.htm|accessdate=28 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a serious public health and human rights problem and has profound short- and long- term impacts on physical and mental health. Though women and girls suffer disproportionately from this kind of violence, it can occur to anybody at any age. It is also an act of violence that can be perpetrated by parents, caregivers, acquaintances, and strangers, as well as intimate partners. Sexual violence is rarely a crime of passion; it is an aggressive act that frequently aims to express power and dominance over the victim.

Sexual violence remains highly stigmatized in all settings; thus, levels of disclosure of the assault vary between regions. In general, it is widely under-reported; thus, available data tend to underestimate the true scale of the problem. In addition, sexual violence is also a neglected area of research; thus, deeper understanding of the issue is needed to promote a coordinated movement against it. It is important to distinguish between domestic sexual violence and conflict-related sexual violence.&lt;ref&gt;[Human Security Report (2012), Sexual Violence, Education and War: Beyond the mainstream narrative, Human Security Research Group, Simon Fraser University, Canada, Human Security Press]&lt;/ref&gt; Often, people who coerce their spouses into sexual acts believe their actions are legitimate because they are married. In times of conflict, sexual violence tends to be an inevitable repercussion of warfare trapped in an ongoing cycle of impunity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=International Committee of the Red Cross|title=Women and War|year=2008|publisher=ICRC|location=Geneva|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs|title=The shame of war: sexual violence against women and girls in conflict|year=2007|publisher=OCHA/IRIN Publication|pages=57–75}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rape is often used as a weapon of war, as a form of attack on the enemy, typifying the conquest and degradation of its women or men or captured fighters of any gender.&lt;ref&gt;Swiss S et al. Violence against women during the Liberian civil conflict. Journal of the American Medical Association, 1998, 279:625–629.&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though [[international humanitarian law]] (IHL) strongly prohibits sexual violence in all armed conflicts and [[international human rights law]] (IHRL) and [[international customary law]] strongly prohibit it at all times, enforcement mechanisms are fragile or do not exist in many parts of the world.&lt;ref name="Lindsey2001" /&gt;&lt;ref name="icrc" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Physicians2002"&gt;{{cite book|last=Physicians for Human Rights|title=War-related sexual violence in Sierra Leone : a population-based assessment : a report|year=2002|publisher=Physicians for Human Rights|location=Boston, MA|isbn=1-879707-37-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="United2007"&gt;{{cite book|last=United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs|title=The shame of war: sexual violence against women and girls in conflict|year=2007|publisher=OCHA/IRIN Publication}}&lt;/ref&gt; Acts of sexual violence can be charged as a [[crime against humanity]], [[genocide]], [[war crime]], or grave breach of the [[Geneva Conventions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bassiouni|first=M.

{{rquote|right| In no other area is our collective failure to ensure effective protection for [[civilians]] more apparent – and by its very nature more shameful – than in terms of the masses of women and girls, but also boys and men, whose lives are destroyed each year by sexual violence perpetrated in conflict.|

References to sexual offences and violence provided in IHL instruments are only partially expressed in the [[1949 Geneva Conventions]], and even more vaguely considered in the 1977 Additional Protocols.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icrc.org/eng/resources/documents/misc/additional-protocols-1977.htm%20 1977 Additional Protocols]. Retrieved 9 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lindsey2001" /&gt; By prohibiting sexual violence in a non-discriminatory manner, [[international humanitarian law]] ensures that women are protected through a two-tiered approach, being covered by general (equal protection as men) and specific protections. IHL mandates special protections to women, according to their additional needs in situations in which they find themselves more vulnerable, for example women who are widows, sick and wounded, migrants, internally displaced, or held in detention.&lt;ref name="icrc_a"&gt;{{cite web|title=Customary IHL.

Although evidence of sexual atrocities such as [[mass rape]]s is acknowledged in the [[Nuremberg War Crimes Tribunal]] and [[Tokyo Tribunal]], references to sexual violence in their respective charter are absent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sexual Violence and Armed Conflict: United Nations Response|url=https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/public/cover.pdf|accessdate=29 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, the [[International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda]] (ICTR), the [[International Criminal Tribunal for former Yugoslavia]] (ICTY), the hybrid [[Special Court for Sierra Leone]] and the [[Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia]] consider sexual violence as a public tool of war rather than a private crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=St-Germain|first= Tonia|title=Conflict-related sexual violence : international law, local responses|year=2012|publisher=Kumarian Press|location=Sterling, Va.|isbn=978-1-56549-504-3|pages=53–70|author2=Dewey, Susan}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Analytical and Conceptual Framing of Conflict-Related Sexual Violence|url=http://www.stoprapenow.org/uploads/advocacyresources/1321456915.pdf|accessdate=28 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Groundbreaking [[case law]] both by the ''ad hoc'' Tribunals of [[ICTR]] and [[ICTY]] established unprecedented developments by classifying acts of [[war rape|rape]] and sexual violence as [[Genocide#As a crime|crimes of genocide]] and [[crimes against humanity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lindsey|first=Charlotte|title=Women facing war|year=2001|publisher=ICRC|location=Geneva|pages=57–58}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=St-Germain|first= Tonia|title=Conflict-related sexual violence : international law, local responses|year=2012|publisher=Kumarian Press|location=Sterling, Va.|isbn=978-1-56549-504-3|pages=55–57|author2=Dewey, Susan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Akayesu#Trial|Akayesu case]] goes beyond [[domestic law]] definitions of sexual violence and is the first case in which sexual violence is perceived as an integral part of [[genocide]] as defined in the [[Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide|1948 Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide]].&lt;ref name="unictr"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Prosecutor v.

The first trial solely focused on the perpetration of systematic sexual violence ([[rape camps]]) and on [[crimes against humanity]] committed against women and girls was in the [[Foča massacres|Foca case]], a ruling before the [[International Criminal Tribunal for former Yugoslavia]] (ICTY).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Case information sheet on the Foca Case (Kunarac, Kovac &amp; Vukovic) (IT-96-23 and 23/1)|url=http://www.icty.org/x/cases/kunarac/cis/en/cis_kunarac_al_en.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Prosecutor v.

An extensive amount of both [[Hard law|hard]] and [[soft law]] instruments set rules, standards and norms for the protection of victims of sexual offences. Among the wide range of international human rights law instruments are the [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women]] (1979),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (1979), art. 6 |url=https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/cedaw/text/econvention.htm#article6 |accessdate=29 November 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5xc2eRFDv?url=http://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/cedaw/text/econvention.htm |archivedate=1 April 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women]] (1993), the Inter-American Convention on the Prevention, Punishment and Eradication of Violence Against Women (1994),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/instree/brazil1994.html Inter-American Convention on the Prevention, Punishment and Eradication of Violence Against Women (1994)]&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Protocol to the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights on the Rights of Women in Africa]] (2003), and the [[Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action]] (1993). The [[UN Security Council]], [[ECOSOC]] and the [[UN Commission on Human Rights]] do not take into account the nature of the conflict with respect to the protection of women in war time.&lt;ref name="icrc_a" /&gt;

Five UN Security Council Resolutions specifically address sexual violence:

The first time the [[Security Council]] addressed the impacts of armed conflict on women was in [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1325|Resolution 1325 (2000)]]. The document focuses on the need for specific protections for women and girls in conflict and expresses the need to consider gender perspectives in mission, UN peace support operations, and post-conflict processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Peace Women. Women, Peac and Security: Resolution 1325|url=http://peacewomen.org/themes_theme.php?id=15&amp;subtheme=true|accessdate=1 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Resolution 1820|Resolution 1820 (2008)]] of the [[UN Security Council]] declares that [[rape]] and other forms of sexual violence "can constitute [[war crimes]], [[crimes against humanity]] or a constitutive act with respect to [[genocide]]".

[[File:Zainab Bangura giving a radio interview in Kinshasa (8654821769).jpg|thumb|Zainab Bangura, the United Nations Special Representative on Sexual Violence in Conflict since September 2012]]
[[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1888|Resolution 1888 (2009)]] is perceived as an advancement in international law as it created the Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary General for Sexual Violence in Conflict (SRSG-SVC).&lt;ref name="un" /&gt; The first Special Representative, [[Margot Wallström]], was appointed in April 2010. The current Special Representative [[Zainab Hawa Bangura]] took office in September 2012. The Office identified eight priority countries: [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]; [[Central African Republic]] (CAR); [[Colombia]]; [[Cote d’Ivoire]]; [[Democratic Republic of Congo]] (DRC); [[Liberia]]; [[South Sudan]] and [[Sudan]].&lt;ref name="un"&gt;{{cite web|title=Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Sexual Violence in Conflict|url=https://www.un.org/sexualviolenceinconflict/about-us/about-the-office/|accessdate=28 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; SRSG-SVC is also engaged in the Middle East ([[Syria]]) and in Asia and the Pacific ([[Cambodia]]).&lt;ref name="un" /&gt;

The six priorities of the Office are:

# to end impunity for sexual violence in conflict by assisting national authorities to strengthen criminal accountability, responsiveness to survivors and judicial capacity;
# the protection and empowerment of civilians who face sexual violence in conflict, in particular, women and girls who are targeted disproportionately by this crime;
# to mobilize political ownership by fostering government engagement in developing and implementing strategies to combat sexual violence;
# to increase recognition of rape as a tactic and consequence of war through awareness-raising activities at the international and country levels;
# to harmonise the UN’s response by leading [[UN Action Against Sexual Violence in Conflict]], a network of focal points from 13 UN agencies that amplify programming and advocacy on this issue in the wider UN agenda;
# to emphasize greater national ownership.&lt;ref name="un" /&gt;

[[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1960|Resolution 1960 (2010)]] reaffirms that sexual violence is systematic, rampant and widespread.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Security Council Open Debate on Sexual Violence in Conflict, December 2010 (Security Council Resolution 1960)|url=http://www.peacewomen.org/security_council_monitor/debate-watch/all-debates/26/open-debate-on-sexual-violence-in-conflict|accessdate=1 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resolution creates new institutional tools for the prevention and protection from sexual violence. The aim of the resolution is to provide further steps for combating impunity and recognizing sexual violence as a serious breach of human rights law and international humanitarian law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Provisional Guidance Note - Implementation of Security Council Resolution 1960 (2010) On Women, Peace and Security (conflict-related sexual violence)|url=http://www.refworld.org/publisher,SRSG_SVC,,,4e23ed5d2,0.html|accessdate=1 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Laches''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|l|æ|tʃ|ɪ|z}} "latches", {{IPAc-en|ˈ|l|eɪ|tʃ|ɪ|z}} {{respell|LAY|chiz}};  [[Law French]]: ''remissness'', ''dilatoriness'', from Old French ''laschesse'') refers to a lack of diligence and activity in making a legal claim, or moving forward with legal enforcement of a right, particularly in regard to [[equity (law)|equity]]; hence, it is an ''unreasonable'' delay that can be viewed as prejudicing the opposing [defending] party. When asserted in litigation, it is an [[Equity (law)|equity]] defense, that is, a defense to a claim for an equitable remedy. The person invoking laches is asserting that an opposing party has "slept on its rights", and that, as a result of this delay, circumstances have changed, witnesses or evidence may have been lost or no longer available, etc., such that it is no longer a just resolution to grant the [[plaintiff]]'s claim. Laches is associated with the maxim of equity, "Equity aids the vigilant, not the sleeping ones [that is, those who sleep on their rights]." Put another way, failure to assert one’s rights in a timely manner can result in a claim being barred by laches.

==Origin, definition, overview==
{{refimprove section|date=January 2016}}
Laches is a legal term derived from the [[Old French]] ''laschesse,'' meaning "remissness" or "dilatoriness," and is viewed as the opposite of "vigilance."&lt;ref name="bld"&gt;{{cite book| chapter = Laches [Definition of 'laches' by Black's]  | title=Black's Law Dictionary | year=2009 | edition=9th | editor-last=Garner|editor-first=Bryan A. | isbn=0314199497 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=weU2AQAAIAAJ | accessdate=5 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|Laches [Definition of 'laches' by OED]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/laches|title=Laches [Definition of 'laches' by Merriam-Webster]|author=|date=|work=merriam-webster.com|accessdate=5 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States Supreme Court case ''Costello v.

Sometimes courts will also require that the party invoking the doctrine has changed its position as a result of the delay, but that requirement is more typical of the related (but more stringent) defense and equally cause of action of [[estoppel]].{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

A claim of laches requires the following components:(1) a delay in bringing the action, (2) a delay that is unreasonable and (3) that prejudices the defendant.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}&lt;ref name="danjaq"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-9th-circuit/1040539.html|title=Danjaq LLC MGM UA v. SONY Corporation|author=|date=|work=Findlaw|accessdate=5 January 2016}}{{primary source inline|date=January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{primary source inline|date=January 2016}}

===Delay===
The period of delay begins when the plaintiff knew, or reasonably ought to have known, that the cause of action existed; the period of delay ends only when the legal action is formally filed.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.modeljuryinstructions.com/tag/laches/&lt;/ref&gt; Informing or warning the defendant of the cause of action (for example by sending a cease-and-desist letter or merely ''threatening'' a lawsuit) does ''not'', by itself, end the period of delay.&lt;ref name="danjaq"/&gt;{{primary source inline|date=January 2016}}

===Unreasonableness===
To invoke laches the delay by the opposing party in initiating the lawsuit must be '''unreasonable'''.  The courts have recognized the following causes of delay as reasonable:{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}
* the exhaustion of remedies through the administrative process
* the evaluation and preparation of a complicated claim
* to determine whether the scope of proposed infringement will justify the cost of litigation&lt;ref name="danjaq"/&gt;{{primary source inline|date=January 2016}}

By contrast, it is ''not'' reasonable to delay a lawsuit to "capitalize on the value of the infringer's labor".  In ''Danjaq v. Sony'', the Ninth Circuit decided that a screenwriter who waited for a film studio to publicize and distribute a film based on a script he allegedly owned had delayed his lawsuit unreasonably.&lt;ref name="danjaq"/&gt;{{primary source inline|date=January 2016}}

===Prejudice===
Unreasonable delay must prejudice the defendant.  Examples of such prejudice include:{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}
* evidence favorable to the defendant becoming lost or degraded
* witnesses favorable to the defendant dying or losing their memories
* the defendant making economic decisions (e.g. investing in a movie or a manufacturing process) that it would not have done, had the lawsuit been filed earlier.&lt;ref name="danjaq"/&gt;
Unreasonable delay may also prejudice the rights of third-parties who were unknown in the case, earlier but whose rights got created in the intervening period of the delay (e.g.: the defendant inducts new persons on a disputed property by sale, or by lease)

==Procedure==
{{primary sources|section|date=January 2016}}
A defense lawyer raising the defense of ''laches'' against a motion for [[Injunction|injunctive relief]] (a form of equitable relief) might argue that the plaintiff comes "waltzing in at the eleventh hour" when it is now too late to grant the relief sought, at least not without causing great harm that the plaintiff could have avoided. In certain types of cases (for example, cases involving time-sensitive matters, such as elections), a delay of even a few days is likely to be met with a defense of ''laches'', even where the applicable [[statute of limitations]] might allow the type of action to be commenced within a much longer time period. In courts in the United States, laches has often been applied even where a statute of limitations exists, although there is a division of authority on this point.&lt;ref name="Little Bit of Laches" /&gt;

If a court does accept the laches defense, it can decide either to deny the request for equitable relief or to narrow the equitable relief that it would otherwise give. Even if the court denies equitable relief to a plaintiff because of laches, the plaintiff may still have a claim for legal relief if the statute of limitations has not run out.

Under the United States [[Federal Rules of Civil Procedure]], ''laches'' is an [[affirmative defense]], which means that the burden of asserting ''laches'' is on the party responding to the claim to which it applies.{{quote|"When the defense of laches is clear on the face of the complaint, and where it is clear that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts to avoid the insuperable bar, a court may consider the defense on a motion to dismiss."&lt;ref&gt;Solow v. Nine West Group, 2001 WL 736794, *3 (S.D.N.Y. June 29, 2001).{{primary source inline|date=January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{primary source inline|date=January 2016}} &lt;ref&gt;Simons v. United States, 452 F.2d 1110, 1116 (2d Cir. 1971) (affirming Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal based, in part, on laches where papers "reveal no reason for the inordinate and prejudicial delay").{{primary source inline|date=January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{primary source inline|date=January 2016}} }}

The ''laches'' defense does not apply if the claimant was a [[Minor (law)|minor]] during the time that the claim was not brought, so a party can bring a claim against an historical injustice when they reach their majority.&lt;ref name=MajorityDefense&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ttabvue.uspto.gov/ttabvue/v?pno=92046185&amp;pty=CAN&amp;eno=199|title=USPTO Trademark Trial and Appeal Board, Amanda Blackhorse, Marcus Briggs-Cloud, Philip Gover, Jillian Pappan, and Courtney Tsotigh v.

==Compared to statute of limitations==
The defense of ''laches'' resembles a [[statute of limitations]] since both are concerned with ensuring that plaintiffs bring their claims in a timely fashion.

However,  a statute of limitations is concerned only with the time that has passed. Laches is concerned with the reasonableness of the delay in a particular situation and so is more case-specific and more focused on the equitable conduct of the plaintiff. Those considerations are not unique to the laches defense because they are characteristic of equitable reasoning and equitable remedies.&lt;ref name="Little Bit of Laches" /&gt; Whereas, limitation is a statutory remedy.

In the US, the proper disposal of claims in light of those two areas of law has required attention through to the Supreme Court. In ''[[Petrella v. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]'' (2014), the [[US Supreme Court]] rebuffed a defendant's claim that laches barred a copyright infringement suit because Congress had established a detailed statutory scheme, including a statute of limitations.&lt;ref name=Fisher&gt;{{cite journal | author = Fisher, Daniel | url = https://www.forbes.com/sites/danielfisher/2014/05/19/unusual-split-as-supreme-court-upholds-raging-bull-suit-vs-mgm/ | date = 2014  | title = Supreme Court Upholds 'Raging Bull' Suit vs. MGM | journal = [[Forbes (magazine)|Forbes]] | format = online | issue = May 19, 2014 | access-date = 5 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''linear system''' is a [[mathematical model]] of a [[system]] based on the use of a [[linear operator]].
Linear systems typically exhibit features and properties that are much simpler than the [[nonlinear]] case.
As a mathematical abstraction or idealization, linear systems find important applications in [[automatic control]] theory, [[signal processing]], and [[telecommunications]]. For example, the propagation medium for wireless communication systems can often be
modeled by linear systems.

==Definition==
A general [[deterministic system (mathematics)|deterministic system]] can be described by an operator, &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;, that maps an input, &lt;math&gt;x(t)&lt;/math&gt;, as a function of &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; to an output, &lt;math&gt;y(t)&lt;/math&gt;, a type of [[Black box (systems)|black box]] description.  Linear systems satisfy the property of [[Superposition principle|superposition]]. Given two valid inputs 
:&lt;math&gt;x_1(t) \,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;x_2(t) \,&lt;/math&gt;
as well as their respective outputs
:&lt;math&gt;y_1(t) = H \left \{ x_1(t) \right \} &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;y_2(t) = H \left \{ x_2(t) \right \} &lt;/math&gt;
then a linear system must satisfy
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha y_1(t) + \beta y_2(t) = H \left \{ \alpha x_1(t) + \beta x_2(t) \right \} &lt;/math&gt;
for any [[scalar (mathematics)|scalar]] values &lt;math&gt;\alpha \,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta \,&lt;/math&gt;.
&lt;!-- Insert picture depicting the superposition and scaling properties --&gt;

The system is then defined by the equation &lt;math&gt;H(x(t)) = y(t)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;y(t)&lt;/math&gt; is some arbitrary function of time, and &lt;math&gt;x(t)&lt;/math&gt; is the system state.  Given &lt;math&gt;y(t)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;x(t)&lt;/math&gt; can be solved for.  For example, a simple harmonic oscillator obeys the differential equation:
:&lt;math&gt;m \frac{d^2(x)}{dt^2} = -kx&lt;/math&gt;.

If
:&lt;math&gt;H(x(t)) = m \frac{d^2(x(t))}{dt^2} + kx(t)&lt;/math&gt;,
then &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is a linear operator.  Letting &lt;math&gt;y(t) = 0&lt;/math&gt;, we can rewrite the differential equation as &lt;math&gt;H(x(t)) = y(t)&lt;/math&gt;, which shows that a simple harmonic oscillator is a linear system.

The behavior of the resulting system subjected to a complex input can be described as a sum of responses to simpler inputs.  In nonlinear systems, there is no such relation.  
This mathematical property makes the solution of modelling equations simpler than many nonlinear systems.
For [[time-invariant system|time-invariant]] systems this is the basis of the [[impulse response]] or the [[frequency response]] methods (see [[LTI system theory]]), which describe a general input function &lt;math&gt;x(t)&lt;/math&gt; in terms of unit [[Dirac's delta function|impulses]] or [[frequency components]].  

Typical [[differential equation]]s of linear [[time-invariant system|time-invariant]] systems are well adapted to analysis using the [[Laplace transform]] in the [[continuous function|continuous]] case, and the [[Z-transform]] in the [[discrete mathematics|discrete]] case (especially in computer implementations).

Another perspective is that solutions to linear systems comprise a system of [[function (mathematics)|function]]s which act like [[vector (geometric)|vector]]s in the geometric sense.

A common use of linear models is to describe a nonlinear system by [[linearization]].  This is usually done for mathematical convenience.

==Time-varying impulse response==
The '''time-varying impulse response''' ''h''(''t''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) of a linear system is defined as the response of the system at time ''t'' = ''t''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to a single [[impulse function|impulse]] applied at time ''t'' = ''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.  In other words, if the input ''x''(''t'') to a linear system is 

:&lt;math&gt;x(t) = \delta(t-t_1) \,&lt;/math&gt;

where δ(''t'') represents the [[Dirac delta function]], and the corresponding response ''y''(''t'') of the system is

:&lt;math&gt;y(t) |_{t=t_2} = h(t_2,t_1) \,&lt;/math&gt;

then the function  ''h''(''t''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) is the time-varying impulse response of the system. Since the system cannot respond before the input is applied the following '''causality condition''' must be satisfied:

:&lt;math&gt; h(t_2,t_1)=0, t_2&lt;t_1 &lt;/math&gt;

==The convolution integral==

The output of any general continuous-time linear system is related to the input by an integral which may be written over a doubly infinite range because of the causality condition:

:&lt;math&gt; y(t) = \int_{-\infty}^{t}  h(t,t') x(t')dt' = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}  h(t,t') x(t') dt' &lt;/math&gt;

If the properties of the system do not depend on the time at which it is operated then it is said to be '''time-invariant''' and h() is a function only of the time difference τ = t-t' which is zero for τ&lt;0 (namely t&lt;t'). By redefinition of h() it is then possible to write the input-output relation equivalently in any of the ways,

:&lt;math&gt; y(t) = \int_{-\infty}^{t}  h(t-t') x(t') dt' = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}  h(t-t') x(t') dt' = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}  h(\tau) x(t-\tau) d \tau  = \int_{0}^{\infty}  h(\tau) x(t-\tau) d \tau &lt;/math&gt;

Linear time-invariant systems are most commonly characterized by the Laplace transform of the impulse response function called  the ''transfer function'' which is:

:&lt;math&gt;H(s) =\int_0^\infty  h(t) e^{-st}\, dt.&lt;/math&gt;

In applications this is usually a rational algebraic function of s. Because h(t) is zero for negative t, the integral may  equally be written over the doubly infinite range and putting s = iω follows the formula for the ''frequency response function'':

:&lt;math&gt; H(i\omega) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}  h(t) e^{-i\omega t} dt &lt;/math&gt;

==Discrete time systems==
The output of any discrete time linear system is related to the input by the time-varying convolution sum:

:&lt;math&gt; y[n] = \sum_{m =-\infty}^{n} { h[n,m] x[m] }  = \sum_{m =-\infty}^{\infty} { h[n,m] x[m] }&lt;/math&gt;

or equivalently for a time-invariant system on redefining h(),

:&lt;math&gt; y[n] = \sum_{k =0}^{\infty} { h[k] x[n-k] } = \sum_{k =-\infty}^{\infty} { h[k] x[n-k] }&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt; k = n-m \, &lt;/math&gt;

represents the lag time between the stimulus at time ''m'' and the response at time ''n''.

'''Magical thinking''' is a term used in [[anthropology]] and [[psychology]], denoting the [[non causa pro causa|fallacious attribution]] of [[causality|causal relationships]] between actions and events, with subtle differences in meaning between the two fields. In anthropology, it denotes the attribution of causality between entities [[Grouped Events|grouped]] with one another ([[coincidence]]) or similar to one another. 
In [[psychology]], the entities between which a causal relation has to be posited are more strictly delineated; here it denotes the belief that one's thoughts by themselves can bring about effects in the world or that thinking something corresponds with doing it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first= Andrew M. |last= Colman |title= A Dictionary of Psychology |edition= 3rd |publisher= Oxford University Press |year= 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In both cases, the belief can cause a person to experience fear, seemingly not rationally justifiable to an observer outside the belief system, of performing certain acts or having certain thoughts because of an assumed [[correlation]] between doing so and threatening calamities.

==Anthropology==
In [[religion]], [[folk religion]], and [[superstition|superstitious]] [[belief]]s, the posited causality is between religious [[ritual]], [[prayer]], [[sacrifice]], or the observance of a [[taboo]], and an expected benefit or recompense. The use of a lucky item or ritual, for example, is assumed to increase the probability that one will perform at a level so that one can achieve a desired goal or outcome.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last= Hamerman|first= Eric J.|last2= Morewedge|first2= Carey K.|date= 2015-03-01|title= Reliance on Luck Identifying Which Achievement Goals Elicit Superstitious Behavior|url= http://psp.sagepub.com/content/41/3/323|journal= Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|language= en|volume= 41|issue= 3|pages= 323–335|doi= 10.1177/0146167214565055|issn= 0146-1672|pmid= 25617118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers have identified two possible principles as the formal causes of the attribution of false causal relationships:

* the [[Post hoc ergo propter hoc | temporal contiguity of two events]]
* "associative thinking", the association of entities based upon their semblance to one another

Prominent [[Victorian era|Victorian]] theorists identified associative thinking (a common feature of practitioners of magic) as a characteristic form of irrationality. As with all forms of magical thinking, association-based and similarities-based notions of causality are not always said to be the practice of magic by a magician. For example, the [[doctrine of signatures]] held that similarities between plant parts and body parts indicated their efficacy in treating diseases of those body parts, and was a part of Western medicine during the [[Middle age|Middle Ages]]. This association-based thinking is a vivid example of the general human application of the [[representativeness heuristic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1= Nisbet | first1= D. | last2= Ross | first2= L. | year= 1980 |title= Human Inference: Strategies and Shortcomings of Social Judgment | publisher= Prentice Hall | location= Englewood Cliffs, NJ | pages= 115–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Edward Burnett Tylor]] coined the term "associative thinking", characterizing it as pre-logical,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Glucklich |first = Ariel |title = The End of Magic |publisher = Oxford University Press |year = 1997 |pages = 32–3 |ref= {{Harvid|Glucklich|1997}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date= May 2015}} in which the "magician's folly" is in mistaking an imagined connection with a real one.

Evans-Pritchard |title = Witchcraft, Magic, and Oracles Among the Azande |location = Oxford |publisher = [[Oxford University Press| Clarendon Press]] |year = 1937 |ref= {{harvid|Evans-Pritchard|1937}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; believe that rubbing crocodile teeth on banana plants can invoke a fruitful crop. Because crocodile teeth are curved (like bananas) and grow back if they fall out, the Azande observe this similarity and want to impart this capacity of regeneration to their bananas. To them, the rubbing constitutes a means of transference.

[[Sir James Frazer]] (1854-1941) elaborated upon Tylor's principle by dividing magic into the categories of [[sympathetic magic#Similarity and contagion|sympathetic and contagious magic]]. The latter is based upon the [[law of contagion]] or contact, in which two things that were once connected retain this link and have the ability to affect their supposedly related objects, such as harming a person by harming a lock of his hair. Sympathetic magic and [[homeopathy]] operate upon the premise that "like affects like", or that one can impart characteristics of one object to a similar object. Frazer believed that some individuals think the entire world functions according to these mimetic, or homeopathic, principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last= Frazer | first= James | title= The Golden Bough: A Study in Magic and Religion | origyear= 1911 | year= 1915 | edition= 3rd | location= London | publisher= Macmillan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''How Natives Think'' (1925), [[Lucien Lévy-Bruhl]] describes a similar notion of mystical, "collective representations". He too sees magical thinking as fundamentally different from a [[Western world|Western]] style of thought. He asserts that in these representations, "primitive" people's "mental activity is too little differentiated for it to be possible to consider ideas or images of objects by themselves apart from the emotions and passions which evoke those ideas or are evoked by them".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last= Lévy-Bruhl | first= Lucien | authorlink= Lucien Lévy-Bruhl | title= How Natives Think | year= 1925 | publisher= Knopf  | page= 36 | ref={{Harvid|Lévy-Bruhl|1925}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lévy-Bruhl explains that natives commit the ''[[Post hoc ergo propter hoc|post hoc, ergo propter hoc]]'' [[Deductive fallacy|fallacy]], in which people observe that x is followed by y, and conclude that x has caused y.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lévy-Bruhl|1925|p=76}}&lt;/ref&gt; He believes that this fallacy is institutionalized in native culture and is committed regularly and repeatedly.

Despite the view that magic is less than rational and entails an inferior concept of causality, in ''The Savage Mind'' (1966), [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]] suggested that magical procedures are relatively effective in exerting control over the environment. This outlook has generated alternative theories of magical thinking, such as the symbolic and psychological approaches, and softened the contrast between "educated" and "primitive" thinking: "Magical thinking is no less characteristic of our own mundane intellectual activity than it is of Zande curing practices."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1= Richard A. |last1=Shweder |title= Likeness and likelihood in everyday thought: Magical thinking in judgments about personality |journal= Current Anthropology |volume= 18 |issue= 4 |year= 1977 |pages= 637–58 (637) |jstor= 2741505 |doi=10.1086/201974}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=n|The [[Azande]] practice of curing epilepsy by eating the burnt skull of a red bush monkey, based on the apparent similarity of epileptic movements and those of the monkeys, was discussed in {{harvnb|Evans-Pritchard|1937||page= 487}}.
}}

== Other forms ==
[[Bronisław Malinowski]]'s ''Magic, Science and Religion'' (1954) discusses another type of magical thinking, in which words and sounds are thought to have the ability to directly affect the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Glucklich|1997|pp= 59–61, 205–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This type of [[wish fulfillment]] thinking can result in the avoidance of talking about certain subjects ("speak of the devil and he'll appear"), the use of [[euphemisms]] instead of certain words, or the belief that to know the "true name" of something gives one power over it, or that certain chants, prayers, or mystical phrases will bring about physical changes in the world. More generally, it is magical thinking to take a [[symbol]] to be its referent or an [[analogy]] to represent an identity.

[[Sigmund Freud]] believed that magical thinking was produced by [[cognitive development]]al factors. He described practitioners of magic as projecting their mental states onto the world around them, similar to a common phase in child development.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Glucklich|1997|pp= 53–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; From toddlerhood to early school age, children will often link the outside world with their internal consciousness, e.g. "It is raining because I am sad."

== Symbolic approach to magic ==
Another theory of magical thinking is the symbolic approach. Leading thinkers of this category, including [[Stanley Jeyaraja Tambiah|Stanley J. Tambiah]], believe that magic is meant to be expressive, rather than instrumental. As opposed to the direct, mimetic thinking of Frazer, Tambiah asserts that magic utilizes abstract analogies to express a desired state, along the lines of [[metonymy]] or [[metaphor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Brown |first= Michael F. |title= Thinking About Magic |publisher= Greenwood Press |year= 1993 |pages= 5–7 |ref={{Harvid|Brown|1993}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An important question raised by this interpretation is how mere symbols could exert material effects. One possible answer lies in [[John L. Austin]]'s concept of "[[performativity]]," in which the act of saying something makes it true, such as in an inaugural or marital rite.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Glucklich|1997|pp= 60–2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other theories propose that magic is effective because symbols are able to affect internal psycho-physical states. They claim that the act of expressing a certain anxiety or desire can be reparative in itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Glucklich|1997|pp= 49–53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Psychological functions of magic ==
[[Image:Laying on of hands.jpg|right|thumb|300px|A healing ritual (the [[laying on of hands]])]]
Some scholars believe that [[Psychological theories of magic|magic is effective psychologically]]. They cite the [[Placebo|placebo effect]] &lt;nowiki/&gt;and [[Somatoform disorder|psychosomatic disease]] as prime examples of how our mental functions exert power over our bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Glucklich|1997|pp= 50–68}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[Robin W.G. Horton|Robin Horton]] suggests that engaging in magical practices surrounding healing can relieve anxiety, which could have a significant positive physical effect. In the absence of advanced health care, such effects would play a relatively major role, thereby helping to explain the persistence and popularity of such practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Horton |first= Robin |authorlink= Robin W.G. Horton |title= African traditional thought and western science: Part I. From tradition to science |journal= [[Africa (journal)|Africa]]: Journal of the [[International African Institute]] |year= 1967 |volume= 37 |issue= 1 |pages= 50–71 |jstor= 1157195 |ref= {{Harvid|Horton|1967a}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Horton |first= Robin |authorlink= Robin W.G. Horton |title= African traditional thought and western science: Part II. The 'closed' and 'open' predicaments |journal= [[Africa (journal)|Africa]]: Journal of the [[International African Institute]] |year= 1967 |volume= 37 |issue= 2 |pages= 155–87 |jstor= 1158253 |ref= {{Harvid|Horton|1967b}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to theories of anxiety relief and control, people turn to magical beliefs when there exists a sense of uncertainty and potential danger and few logical or scientific responses to such danger. Magic is used to restore a sense of control over circumstance. In support of this theory, research indicates that superstitious behavior is invoked more often in high stress situations, especially by people with a greater desire for control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Keinan |first= Giora |title= The effects of stress and desire for control on superstitious behavior |journal= Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin |volume= 28 |issue= 1 |pages= 102–108|year = 2002 |doi=  10.1177/0146167202281009|accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Keinan |first= Giora |title= The effects of stress and tolerance of ambiguity on magical thinking |journal= Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume= 67 |issue=  1 |pages= 48–55 |year= 1994 |doi=  10.1037/0022-3514.67.1.48 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another potential reason for the persistence of magic rituals is that the rituals prompt their own use by creating a feeling of insecurity and then proposing themselves as precautions.&lt;ref name="Boyer"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Boyer |first= Pascal |authorlink= Pascal Boyer |last2= Liénard |first2= Pierre |title= Ritual behavior in obsessive and normal individuals |journal= Current Directions in Psychological Science |volume= 17 |issue= 4 |pages= 291–94 |year= 2008 |doi=  10.1111/j.1467-8721.2008.00592.x |accessdate= |citeseerx= 10.1.1.503.1537 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pascal Boyer|Boyer]] and Liénard propose that in [[obsessive-compulsive]] rituals — a possible clinical model for certain forms of magical thinking — focus shifts to the lowest level of gestures, resulting in goal demotion. For example, an obsessive-compulsive cleaning ritual may overemphasize the order, direction, and number of wipes used to clean the surface. The goal becomes less important than the actions used to achieve the goal, with the implication that magic rituals can persist without efficacy because the intent is lost within the act.&lt;ref name=Boyer/&gt; Alternatively, some cases of harmless "rituals" may have positive effects in bolstering intent, as may be the case with certain pre-game exercises in sports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Why Rituals Work|url = http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-rituals-work/|website = Scientific American|accessdate = 2015-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Phenomenological approach ==
[[Ariel Glucklich]] tries to understand magic from a subjective perspective, attempting to comprehend magic on a [[Phenomenology (psychology)|phenomenological]], [[wikt:experiential|experiential]]ly based level. Glucklich seeks to describe the attitude that magical practitioners feel which he calls "magical consciousness" or the "magical experience." He explains that it is based upon "the awareness of the interrelatedness of all things in the world by means of simple but refined sense perception."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Glucklich|1997|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another phenomenological model is that of [[Gilbert Lewis (anthropologist)|Gilbert Lewis]], who argues that "habit is unthinking." He believes that those practicing magic do not think of an explanatory theory behind their actions any more than the average person tries to grasp the pharmaceutical workings of aspirin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Lewis |first= Gilbert |title= The Look of Magic |publisher= University of Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When the average person takes an aspirin, he does not know how the medicine chemically functions. He takes the pill with the premise that there is proof of efficacy. Similarly, many who avail themselves of magic do so without feeling the need to understand a [[causal]] theory behind it.

== Idiomatic difference ==
[[Robin W.G. Horton|Robin Horton]] maintains that the difference between the thinking of Western and of non-Western peoples is predominantly "[[idiomatic]]". He asserts that the members of both cultures use the same practical common-sense, and that both science and magic are ways beyond basic logic by which people formulate theories to explain whatever occurs. However, non-Western cultures use the idiom of magic and have community spiritual figures, and therefore non-Westerners turn to magical practices or to a specialist in that idiom. Horton sees the same logic and common-sense in all cultures, but notes that their contrasting [[ontological]] idioms lead to cultural practices which seem illogical to observers whose own culture has correspondingly contrasting norms. He explains, "[T]he layman's grounds for accepting the models propounded by the scientist are often no different from the young African villager's ground for accepting the models propounded by one of his elders."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Horton|1967b|p=171}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Along similar lines, [[Michael F. Brown]] argues that the [[Aguaruna people|Aguaruna]] of Peru see magic as a type of technology, no more supernatural than their physical tools. Brown says that the Aguaruna utilize magic in an empirical manner; for example, they discard any magical stones which they have found to be ineffective. To Brown—as to Horton—magical and scientific thinking differ merely in idiom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Brown |first= Michael F. |title= Tsewa's Gift: Magic and Meaning in an Amazonian Society |publisher= [[University of Alabama Press]] |year= 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These theories blur the boundaries between [[Magic_(paranormal)#Theories_on_the_relationship_of_magic.2C_science.2C_art.2C_and_religion|magic, science, and religion]], and focus on the similarities in magical, technical, and spiritual practices. Brown even ironically writes that he is tempted to disclaim the existence of 'magic.'&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Brown|1993|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Substantive difference ==
One theory of substantive difference is that of the open versus closed society. Horton describes this as one of the key dissimilarities between traditional thought and Western science. He suggests that the scientific worldview is distinguished from a magical one by the [[scientific method]] and by [[skepticism]], requiring the [[falsifiability]] of any scientific hypothesis. He notes that for native peoples "there is no developed awareness of alternatives to the established body of theoretical texts."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Horton |first= Robin |authorlink= Robin W.G. Horton |title= African thought and western science |journal= Rationality |page= 153}}&lt;/ref&gt; He notes that all further differences between traditional and Western thought can be understood as a result of this factor. He says that because there are no alternatives in societies based on magical thought, a theory does not need to be objectively judged to be valid.

==In children==
Magical thinking is most prominent in children between ages 2 and 7. During this age, children strongly believe that their personal thoughts have a direct effect on the rest of the world. Therefore, if they experience something tragic that they do not understand, e.g. a death, their minds will create a reason to feel responsible. [[Jean Piaget]], a [[developmental psychologist]], came up with a theory of four [[Child development stages|developmental stages]]. Children between ages 2 and 7 would be classified under his [[preoperational stage]] of development. During this stage children are still developing their use of [[logical thinking]]. A child's thinking is dominated by perceptions of physical features, meaning that if the child is told that a family pet has gone away, then the child will have difficulty comprehending the transformation of the dog not being around anymore. Magical thinking would be evident here, since the child may believe that the family pet being gone is just temporary. Their young minds in this stage do not understand the finality of death and magical thinking may bridge the gap.

===Grieving children===
Children who evidence magical thinking often feel that they are responsible for an event or events occurring or are capable of reversing an event simply by thinking about it and wishing for a change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Nielson |first= D. |year= 2012 |title= Discussing death with pediatric patients: Implications for nurses |journal= Journal of Pediatric Nursing |volume= 27 |pages= e59-e64 |doi=10.1016/j.pedn.2011.11.006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Make-believe and fantasy are an integral part of life at this age and are often used to explain the inexplicable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Samide |first1= L. |last2= Stockton |first2= R. |year= 2002 |title= Letting go of grief: Bereavement groups for children in the school setting |journal= Journal for Specialists in Group Work |volume= 27 |pages= 192–204 |doi=10.1177/0193392202027002006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Webb |first= N. |year= 2010 |chapter= The Child and Death |editor-first= N.B. |editor-last= Webb |title= Helping Bereaved Children: A Handbook for Practitioners |pages= 5–6 |location= New York |publisher= Guildford |ref= {{Harvid|Webb|2010}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Piaget, children within this age group are often "[[egocentric]]," believing that what they feel and experience is the same as everyone else's feelings and experiences.&lt;ref name = Biank&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Biank |first1= N. |last2= Werner-Lin |first2= A. |year= 2011 |title= Growing up with grief: Revisiting the death of a parent over the life course |journal= Omega |volume= 63 |pages= 271–90 |doi=10.2190/om.63.3.e}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also at this age, there is often a lack of ability to understand that there may be other explanations for events outside of the realm of things they have already comprehended. What happens outside their understanding needs to be explained using what they already know, because of an inability to fully comprehend abstract concepts.&lt;ref name = Biank /&gt;

Magical thinking is found particularly in children's explanations of experiences about death, whether the death of a family member or pet, or their own illness or impending death. These experiences are often new for a young child, who at that point has no experience to give understanding of the ramifications of the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Webb|2010|p=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; A child may feel that they are responsible for what has happened, simply because they were upset with the person who died, or perhaps played with the pet too roughly. There may also be the idea that if the child wishes it hard enough, or performs just the right act, the person or pet may choose to come back, and not be dead any longer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Schoen |first1= A. |last2= Burgoyen |first2= M. |last3= Schoen |first3= S. |year= 2004 |title= Are the developmental needs of children in America adequately addressed during the grief process? |journal= Journal of Instructional Psychology |volume= 31 |pages= 143–8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When considering their own illness or impending death, some children may feel that they are being punished for doing something wrong, or not doing something they should have, and therefore have become ill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Schonfeld |first= D. |year= 1993 |title= Talking with children about death |journal= Journal of Pediatric Health Care |volume= 7 |pages= 269–74 |doi=10.1016/s0891-5245(06)80008-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a child's ideas about an event are incorrect because of their magical thinking, there is a possibility that the conclusions the child makes could result in long-term beliefs and behaviours that create difficulty for the child as they mature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Sossin |first1= K. |last2= Cohen |first2= P. |year= 2011 |title= Children's play in the wake of loss and trauma |journal= Journal of Infant, Child and Adolescent Psychotherapy |volume= 10 |pages= 255–72 |doi=10.1080/15289168.2011.600137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Masterbook''''' is a [[generic role-playing game]] that was created by [[West End Games]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pigames.net/store/default.php?cPath=107 Pigames.net]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://index.rpg.net/display-search.phtml?key=system&amp;value=MasterBook RPG.net]&lt;/ref&gt; It is a follow-up to the multi-genre role-playing game ''[[Torg]]'' and the science fiction game ''[[Shatterzone]]'', which used a modified version of the ''Torg'' system. As of January 2011, it is published by [[Precis Intermedia Gaming]].

Like ''Torg'', the ''Masterbook'' system utilized two complementary forms of in-game conflict resolution: a unified dice mechanic, which was based on a roll of two [[polyhedral dice|ten-sided dice]], and a game-specific deck of cards (the MasterDeck, similar to the Drama Deck in ''Torg'') that influenced random number generation, character actions, and the game's plot. ''Masterbook'' was used for several licensed properties, most notably ''[[The World of Indiana Jones]]'' (1994), ''[[Necroscope|The World of Necroscope]]'' (1995), ''[[World of Aden: Thunderscape|The World of Aden]]'' (1996), ''[[Species (film)|The World of Species]]'' (1995), ''[[Tales from the Crypt (TV series)#In other media|The World of Tales from the Crypt]]'' (1996), and ''[[Tank Girl|The World of Tank Girl]]'' (1995). It was also used for unique settings such as ''[[The World of Bloodshadows]]'' (1994).

The system was, ultimately, a commercial failure despite these licenses, thanks to a combination of factors, including the high level of detail in game mechanics, the unusual synthesis of dice- and card-based conflict resolution, and the low level of [[player character]] power and effect even in fantastic or pulp-style settings such as ''Indiana Jones''. This last factor was in direct contrast to ''Torg'', which helped to isolate many fans of the game's predecessor and drive them to play games whose systems were more directly accommodating to their preferred style of gameplay.

'''Medical torture''' describes the involvement of, or sometimes instigation by, [[medical personnel]] in acts of [[torture]], either to judge what victims can endure, to apply treatments which will enhance torture, or as torturers in their own right. Medical torture overlaps with '''medical interrogation''' if it involves the use of professional medical expertise to facilitate [[interrogation]] or [[corporal punishment]], in the conduct of torturous [[human experimentation]] or in providing professional medical sanction and approval for the torture of prisoners. Medical torture also covers torturous scientific (or pseudo-scientific) experimentation upon unwilling human subjects.

==Medical ethics and international law==
It is generally accepted that medical torture fundamentally violates [[medical ethics]], which all medical practitioners are expected to adhere to.
* The [[Hippocratic Oath]] makes explicit statements against deliberate harm not in the patient's best interests. These statements are often translated as ''"I will prescribe regimens for the good of my patients according to my ability and my judgment"'' and ''"to never deliberately do harm to anyone, for anyone else's interest."'' (Note: these statements are formulations of the ethical principles of [[beneficence (ethics)|beneficence]] and [[non-maleficence]].)
* In response to the [[Nazi human experimentation]] on prisoners during [[World War II]], which were declared at the post-World War II [[Nuremberg Trials]] to be "[[crimes against humanity]]", the [[World Medical Association]] developed the [[Declaration of Geneva]] to supplant the dated Hippocratic Oath. The Declaration of Geneva requires medical practitioners to state "&lt;nowiki&gt;[I, the medical practitioner]&lt;/nowiki&gt; will maintain the utmost respect for human life from its beginning even under threat and I will not use my medical knowledge contrary to the laws of humanity."
* The Nuremberg Trials also led to the emergence of the [[Nuremberg code]] which explicitly outlines the boundaries of acceptable medical experimentation.
* Additionally in response to the [[Nazi atrocities]], the [[Geneva Convention]]s of 1949 outright prohibits the torture of [[prisoners of war]] and other protected [[non-combatants]].
* The [[World Medical Association]] [[Declaration of Tokyo (1975)]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/instree/tokyo.html&lt;/ref&gt; makes a number of specific statements against torture, including "The doctor shall not ''countenance'', ''condone'' or ''participate in'' the practice of torture".
* Also the [[UN Convention Against Torture]], which also applies to medical personnel (in addition to [[law enforcement officers]], [[military personnel]], [[politicians]], and other persons acting in an [[official capacity]]), prohibits the use of torture under any circumstance. Under Article 2(2) of the Convention, it states that "No exceptional circumstances whatsoever, whether a state of [[war]] or a threat of war, internal [[Failed state|political instability]] or any other [[State of Emergency|public emergency]], may be invoked as a justification of torture."
* The UN Principles of Medical Ethics relevant to the Role of Health Personnel, particularly Physicians, in the Protection of Prisoners and Detainees against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (UN.1982) applies specifically to medical and other health workers but it has no implementation mechanism to ensure enforcement. It is up to state, provincial, and national bodies to enforce the standards in the document.
* The development of [[command responsibility]] established [[legal liability|criminal liability]] for all people, including physicians, involved in crimes against humanity.

There remain gaps in regulation relating to medical torture in many countries:

*  Government sponsored torture and organized violence, with the complicity and or participation of health personnel, is internationally prohibited yet these violations occur with impunity in a significant amount of cases. An example of this impunity is found in the [[Abu Ghraib|Abu Ghraib prison]] torture and prisoner scandal as well as documented by [[Amnesty International]].
* A higher standard of behaviour is expected of health professionals yet the [[UN Principles of Medical Ethics]] are not enforceable when governments are complicit in violations. This higher standard is reflected in the principles of beneficence, non-maleficence (above all do no harm), autonomy, justice, dignity and informed consent and these are not covered comprehensively by the [[UN Convention Against Torture]].

==Asserted instances==
* Between 1937 and 1945, Japanese medical personnel who were part of [[Unit 731]] participated in the torture killings of as many as 10,000 Chinese, Russian, American and other prisoners as well as Allied POWs during the [[Sino-Japanese War (1937-1945)|second Sino-Japanese War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aiipowmia.com/731/731caveat.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-04-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090430115229/http://www.aiipowmia.com/731/731caveat.html |archivedate=2009-04-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* During [[World War II]], the [[Nazism|Nazi]] regime in Germany conducted [[Nazi human experimentation|human medical experimentation]] on large numbers of people held in its concentration camps. In particular, [[Josef Mengele]]'s experiments on prisoners at [[Auschwitz]] earned him the nicknames "the Angel of Death" and "Dr. Death".
* During [[World War II]], the [[Nazism|Nazi]] regime in Germany regularly executed prisoners and opponents of the regime. According to some accounts, medical staff was involved in torture during executions. One account of [[Dietrich Bonhoeffer]]'s death states that, as doctor at [[Flossenbürg concentration camp]], "Fischer-Hüllstrung had the job of reviving political prisoners after they had been hanged until they were almost dead, in order to prolong the agony of their dying."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|year=2010|author=Ferdinand Schlingensiepen|isbn=0-7735-1531-3|title=Dietrich Bonhoeffer, 1906–1945: Martyr, Thinker, Man of Resistance|publisher=Continuum/T &amp; T Clark}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Japanese surgeons also performed [[vivisection]] and other medical experiments to torture [[United States|American]] prisoners of war in several islands of the Pacific.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.crimesofwar.org/a-z-guide/medical-experiments-on-pows/&lt;/ref&gt;
* Between 1970 and 1971, mentally disorienting interrogation techniques were used against interned prisoners captured in [[Northern Ireland]], including [[white noise]]. The Irish government complained to the [[European Commission for Human Rights]], who found Britain guilty of torture; however the higher [[European Court of Human Rights]] ruled that the British government's actions were "inhuman and degrading but did not constitute torture".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/war/troubles/origins/internment.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;
* In Soviet mental hospitals [[Punitive psychiatry in the Soviet Union|used to hold political prisoners]], very unpleasant medications were given to these "patients" as a means of punishment.  A psychiatric diagnosis was devised to describe people who oppose government policies.
* In 1978, "Pisaot menuh" ("Human Experiments") were performed on seventeen [[political prisoner]]s held at the infamous prison [[Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum|Tuol Sleng]] in [[Phnom Penh]] under the [[Khmer Rouge]].
* A study called "[[The Aversion Project]]" found that gay conscripts in the [[South African Defence Force]]s (SADF) during the [[apartheid]] era had been forced to submit to "curing" their homosexuality, both by electroshock therapies and by botched [[sex change]]s.
* There have been numerous claims that [[electroconvulsive therapy]] and [[Leukotomy|prefrontal lobotomies]] and similar psychiatric treatments have sometimes been performed not in the patient's best interests, but rather as punishment for misbehaviour or to otherwise make the patient easier to manage. A classic example of this is the Lake Alice, New Zealand atrocity which occurred in the early 1970s. Children admitted to the [[Lake Alice Hospital]]'s open child and adolescent unit were routinely punished with unmodified ECT (that is, [[electroconvulsive therapy#technique|ECT]] without anesthesia). Some governments (e.g. [[Norway]] and [[New Zealand]]) have since begun paying reparations to patients who suffered such treatments. The [[World Health Organization]] has called for a ban on unmodified ECT, and states no form of it should be used on children.
* In 2014, Howard S Schneider, a Jacksonville, Florida pediatric dentist (not to be confused with Howard W Schneider, a pediatric dentist practicing in New York), was accused of [[wikt:sadistic|sadistically]] torturing patients as young as 2. He avoided prosecution by claiming incompetence and is no longer practicing. &lt;ref name="Schneider"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.firstcoastnews.com/story/news/local/consumer/on-your-side/2015/05/07/lawsuit-filed-jacksonville-dentist/70950856/|title=Lawsuit alleges torture, abuse, fraud at local dentist's office}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2016, a group consisting of 71 British medical doctors urged that [[Israel]]'s membership in the [[World Medical Association]] should be revoked because Israeli doctors allegedly perform state-endorsed "medical torture" on Palestinians.&lt;ref name="israel"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/British-doctors-seek-to-expel-Israel-from-World-Medical-Association-442215|title=British doctors seek to expel Israel from World Medical Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Asserted medical or professional complicity==
According to the [[Center for Constitutional Rights]]' When Healers Harm campaign, health professionals were complicit in the torture and abuse of detainees during U.S. President [[George W. Bush]]'s "[[war on terror]]".  Health professionals, including medical doctors, psychiatrists, medical examiners, psychologists, and nurses, have been implicated in the torture and abuse of prisoners in [[CIA]] secret prisons and military detention centers, such as those in [[Guantánamo Bay detention camp|Guantánamo]], [[Afghanistan]], and [[Iraq]].

Among other things, health professionals are accused of:

* crafting abusive tactics and falsely legitimizing their use;
* advised interrogators on methods of abuse that would exploit prisoners’ vulnerabilities;
* using medical procedures to harm prisoners;
* gauging [[pain]] and monitoring interrogations that risked leaving prisoners in need of treatment;
* checking prisoners to certify that they were capable of surviving additional abuse;
* conditioning medical or mental health treatment on cooperation with interrogation;
* sharing confidential patient information that was used to harm patients;
* covering up evidence of torture and abuse; and
* turning a blind eye to cruel treatment.

To date, no state licensing boards or professional associations have investigated – or recognized, in some cases – abusive conduct by individual members of their professions.  In 2009, after years of denial, the [[American Psychological Association]] finally recognized that psychologists had engaged in torture.  However, the American Psychological Association has not recognized that psychologists were involved in the Bush Administration’s torture policy.  Some criticize the [[American Psychological Association|APA]] for failing to respond to allegations of “collusion between APA officials and the national security apparatus in providing ethical cover for psychologists’ participation in detainee abuse."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://psychoanalystsopposewar.org/blog/2009/06/29/open-letter-in-response-to-the-american-psychological-association-board/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-06-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090704035404/http://psychoanalystsopposewar.org/blog/2009/06/29/open-letter-in-response-to-the-american-psychological-association-board/ |archivedate=2009-07-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the [[American Medical Association]] has made clear that physicians should not be involved in interrogations of any kind, it continues to insist that it has “no specific knowledge of doctors being involved in abuse or torture,” despite evidence to the contrary, including government documents and [[Office of Legal Counsel]] memos, a report by the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] and multiple accounts by survivors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://armed-services.senate.gov/Publications/Detainee%20Report%20Final_April%2022%202009.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-04-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090429200942/http://armed-services.senate.gov/Publications/Detainee%20Report%20Final_April%2022%202009.pdf |archivedate=2009-04-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.aclu.org/safefree/general/olc_memos.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Some other accounts of medical or professional complicity in torture include:
*The SERE ("[[Survival, Evasion, Resistance and Escape]]") program's chief psychologist, Col. Morgan Banks, issued guidance in early 2003 for the "behavioral science consultants" who helped to devise [[Guantanamo Bay detainment camp|Guantánamo]]'s interrogation strategy although he has emphatically denied that he had advocated the use of SERE counter-resistance techniques to break down detainees. The ''New Yorker'' notes that in November, 2001 Banks was detailed to Afghanistan, where he spent four months at [[Bagram Air Base]], "supporting combat operations against Al Qaeda and Taliban fighters".
*Confidential medical records of [[Guantanamo Bay detainment camp|Guantánamo]] prisoners were used to identify physical and psychological weaknesses that could be exploited during abusive interrogation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hickman |first=John |year=2013 |title=Selling Guantánamo |location=Gainesville |publisher=University Press of Florida |pages=180–181}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A 2005 report by [[Human Rights Watch]] suggested that torture was routine under the appointed Iraqi government.&lt;ref&gt;http://hrw.org/reports/2005/iraq0105/&lt;/ref&gt;
* Dr. [[J.C. Carothers]], British colonial Kenyan psychiatrist, has been implicated by some recent academic historians in designing interrogation of [[Mau Mau]] prisoners.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} His advice was published by the Kenya Government as The Psychology of Mau Mau, in 1954.&lt;ref&gt;For discussion of Carothers involvement with [[Mau Mau]] in Kenya in the 1950s: {{cite book |last=McCulloch |first=Jock |year=1995 |title=Colonial Psychiatry and "the African Mind" |location=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press |pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=FToFMwnBacQC&amp;pg=PA64 64–74]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Similarly, it has been implied that Interim [[Iraq]]i Prime Minister Dr. [[Ayad Allawi]] violated his obligation to medical ethics whilst serving as Western European chief of [[secret police]] for the [[Ba'ath Party|Baath]]ist government of [[Saddam Hussein]]. However, the same sources allege that Allawi had abandoned his medical education at that point and his medical degree "was conferred upon him by the Baath party."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newyorker.com/fact/content/?040628fa_fact&lt;/ref&gt;

==In fiction==
* Actor [[Michael Palin]] plays a medical torturer in Director [[Terry Gilliam]]'s 1985 dark comedic dystopian film ''[[Brazil (1985 film)|Brazil]]''.
* In the film adaptation of [[George Orwell]]'s [[Nineteen Eighty-Four]] the main character, [[Winston Smith]], is subjected to medical torture by the [[thought police]].

* The film ''[[One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (film)|One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest]]'', starring [[Jack Nicholson]], depicts abuse of psychiatric techniques including [[electroconvulsive therapy]] and [[lobotomy]].
* In the popular series, ''[[24 (TV series)|24]]'', various forms of medical torture (including hallucinogens and injections) are utilized to obtain confessions and information from high-threat terrorists being interrogated in the fictional Counter-Terrorist Unit (CTU) of the United States.
* In Anthony Burgess' book ''[[A Clockwork Orange (novel)|A Clockwork Orange]]'', Alex, the anti-hero of the book, undergoes a fictional medical torture program called 'The Ludovico Technique', in which he is given a nausea-inducing drug, strapped to a chair with his eyelids forced open and forced to watch hours of films of extreme violence and rape to condition him to associate feelings of nausea with rape and violence.
* The theme of the 2009 horror film ''[[The Human Centipede (First Sequence)]]'' is that of a sadistic, psychopathic retired surgeon torturing three people by surgically connecting them mouth to rectum, forcing the last two to swallow the excrement of the person in front of them and physically beating all three of them if they try to rebel or escape.
* The 2008 horror film ''[[Autopsy (2008 film)|Autopsy]]'' focused on an insane doctor who runs a hospital where victims are lured in and experimented with, so that the doctor can find a cure for his wife's terminal disease.
* In the book ''[[Dearly Devoted Dexter]]'' by [[Jeff Lindsay (writer)|Jeff Lindsay]] the central antagonist is a character nicknamed 'Dr. Danco' who surgically removes all body parts not necessary for life from his victims as what is revealed to be forfeits in a twisted game of [[hangman (game)|hangman]], carrying out the operations with the victim conscious and watching the procedures in a mirror.
* The multi-perspective novel ''The Sea and Poison'' ([[Shusaku Endo]], 1957; translated by Michael Gallagher) depicts the vivisection experiments performed by Japanese doctors on American soldiers during World War II. Kei Kumai's 1986 drama film ''[[The Sea and Poison]]'' is based on this book (original film title "Umi to dokuyaku").

In [[organic chemistry]], '''negative hyperconjugation''' is the donation of [[electron density]] from a filled π- or p-orbital to a neighboring [[antibonding orbital|σ&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;-orbital]].&lt;ref name="iupac1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://old.iupac.org/goldbook/NT07081.pdf |title=Negative Hyper-Conjugation |publisher=Old.iupac.org |accessdate=2013-10-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324085532/http://old.iupac.org/goldbook/NT07081.pdf |archivedate=2012-03-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This phenomenon, a type of [[resonance (chemistry)|resonance]], can stabilize the molecule or [[transition state]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/54173058/46/Negative-Hyperconjugation |title=2.2.3 Negative Hyperconjugation for Ebooksclub.org Molecular Orbitals and Organic Chemical Reactions Student Edition |publisher=Scribd.com |date=2011-04-29 |accessdate=2012-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It also causes an elongation of the [[sigma bond|σ-bond]] by adding electron density to its [[antibonding orbital]].&lt;ref name="iupac1"/&gt;

Negative hyperconjugation is most commonly observed when the σ&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;-orbital is located on certain C–F or C–O bonds,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2008/NJ/b718430a |title=Negative hyperconjugation of some fluorine containing groups – New Journal of Chemistry (RSC Publishing) |publisher=Pubs.rsc.org |date= |accessdate=2012-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jo7017476 |title=Role of Negative Hyperconjugation and Anomeric Effects in the Stabilization of the Intermediate in SNV Reactions - The Journal of Organic Chemistry (ACS Publications) |publisher=Pubs.acs.org |date=2007-08-09 |accessdate=2012-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and does not occur to an appreciable extent with normal C–H bonds.

In negative hyperconjugation, the electron density flows in the ''opposite'' direction (from π- or p-orbital to empty σ&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;-orbital) than it does in the more common [[hyperconjugation]] (from σ-orbital to empty p-orbital).

{{Quantum mechanics}}

In [[physics]], the '''observer effect''' is the theory that simply observing a situation or [[phenomenon]] necessarily changes that phenomenon. This is often the result of instruments that, by necessity, alter the state of what they measure in some manner. A commonplace example is checking the pressure in an automobile tire; this is difficult to do without letting out some of the air, thus changing the pressure. Similarly, it is not possible to see any object without light hitting the object, and causing it to reflect that light. While the effects of observation are oftentimes negligible, the object still experiences a change. This effect can be found in many domains of physics, but can usually be reduced to insignificance by using different instruments or observation techniques. 

An especially unusual version of the observer effect occurs in [[quantum mechanics]], as best demonstrated by the [[double-slit experiment]]. Physicists have found that even passive observation of quantum phenomena (by changing the test apparatus and passively 'ruling out' all but one possibility), can actually change the measured result. A particularly famous example is the 1998 Weizmann experiment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Quantum Theory Demonstrated: Observation Affects Reality | date=27 Feb 1998 | author=Weizmann Institute Of Science | journal=Science Daily | url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/1998/02/980227055013.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the "observer" in this experiment being an electronic detector&amp;mdash;possibly due to the assumption that the word "observer" implies a person&amp;mdash;its results have led to the popular belief that a conscious mind can directly affect reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Mystery of the Quantum World | author=Squires, Euan J. | year=1994 | publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis Group | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PinUwd99CV8C | chapter=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The need for the "observer" to be conscious has been rejected by mainstream science as a misconception rooted in a poor understanding of the quantum wave function {{mvar|ψ}} and the quantum measurement process,&lt;ref&gt;"Of course the introduction of the observer must not be misunderstood to imply that some kind of subjective features are to be brought into the description of nature. The observer has, rather, only the function of registering decisions, i.e., processes in space and time, and ''it does not matter whether the observer is an apparatus or a human being''; but the registration, i.e., the transition from the "possible" to the "actual," is absolutely necessary here and cannot be omitted from the interpretation of quantum theory." - [[Werner Heisenberg]], ''Physics and Philosophy'', p. 137&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Was the wave function waiting to jump for thousands of millions of years until a single-celled living creature appeared? Or did it have to wait a little longer for some highly qualified measurer - with a PhD?" -[[John Stewart Bell]], 1981, ''Quantum Mechanics for Cosmologists''. In C.J. Isham, R. Penrose and D.W. Sciama (eds.), 
''Quantum Gravity 2: A second Oxford Symposium''. Oxford: Clarendon Press, p.611.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;According to standard quantum mechanics,  it is a matter of complete indifference whether the experimenters stay around to watch their experiment, or leave the room and delegate observing to an inanimate apparatus, instead, which amplifies the microscopic events to macroscopic  measurements and records them by a time-irreversible process ({{Cite book|title = Speakable and Unspeakable in Quantum Mechanics: Collected Papers on Quantum Philosophy|last = Bell|first = John|publisher = Cambridge University Press|year = 2004|isbn = 9780521523387|pages = 170}}). The measured state is not interfering with the states excluded by the measurement. As [[Richard Feynman]] put it: "Nature does not know what you are looking at, and she behaves the way she is going to behave whether you bother to take down the data or not." ({{Cite book|title = The Feynman Lectures on Physics, Vol. III|last = Feynman|first = Richard|publisher = Basic Books|year = 2015|isbn = 9780465040834|location =Ch 3.2 |pages = }}).&lt;/ref&gt; apparently being the generation of information at its most basic level that produces the effect.

==Particle physics==
For an [[electron]] to become detectable, a [[photon]] must first interact with it, and this interaction will inevitably change the path of that electron. It is also possible for other, less direct means of measurement to affect the electron. It is necessary to distinguish clearly between the measured value of a quantity and the value resulting from the measurement process. In particular, a measurement of momentum is non-repeatable in short intervals of time. A formula (one-dimensional for simplicity) relating involved quantities, due to [[Niels Bohr]] (1928) is given by
:&lt;math&gt;|v'_x - v_x|\Delta p_x \approx \hbar/\Delta t,&lt;/math&gt;
where 
:Δ''p&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'' is uncertainty in measured value of momentum,
:Δ''t'' is duration of measurement,
:''v&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'' is velocity of particle ''before'' measurement,
:{{SubSup|''v''|''x''|'}} is velocity of particle ''after'' measurement,
: {{math|''ħ''}} is the reduced [[Planck constant]].

The ''measured'' momentum of the electron is then related to {{math|''v''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, whereas its momentum ''after'' the measurement is related to {{math|''v''&amp;prime;&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;}}. This is a best-case scenario.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|first1=L.D.|last1=Landau|authorlink1=Lev Landau|first2=E. M.|last2=Lifshitz|authorlink2=Evgeny Lifshitz|translator-last1=Sykes|translator-first1=J. B.|translator-last2=Bell|translator-first2=J.

==Electronics==
In [[electronics]], [[ammeter]]s and [[voltmeter]]s are usually wired in series or parallel to the circuit, and so by their very presence affect the current or the voltage they are measuring by way of presenting an additional real or complex [[Electrical load|load]] to the circuit, thus changing the [[transfer function]] and behavior of the circuit itself. Even a more passive device such as a [[current clamp]], which measures the wire current without coming into physical contact with the wire, affects the current through the circuit being measured because the [[mutual inductance|inductance is mutual]].

==Thermodynamics==
In [[thermodynamics]], a standard [[mercury-in-glass thermometer]] must absorb or give up some [[thermal energy]] to record a [[temperature]], and therefore changes the temperature of the body which it is measuring.

==Quantum mechanics==
The theoretical foundation of the concept of [[measurement in quantum mechanics]] is a contentious issue deeply connected to the many [[interpretations of quantum mechanics]]. A key focus point is that of [[wave function collapse]], for which several popular interpretations assert that measurement causes a ''discontinuous change'' into an [[Eigenvalues and eigenvectors#Schr.C3.B6dinger equation|eigenstate]] of the operator associated with the quantity that was measured, a change which is not time-reversible.

More explicitly, the [[quantum superposition|superposition]] principle ({{math|''ψ'' {{=}} Σ''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;ψ&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'')}} of quantum physics dictates that for a wave function {{mvar|ψ}}, a measurement will result in a state of the quantum system of one of the {{mvar|m}} possible eigenvalues {{math|''f&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; , n'' {{=}} 1, 2, ..., ''m''}}, of the operator{{math|{{overset|&amp;and;|''F''}} }} which in the space of the eigenfunctions {{math|''ψ&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; , n'' {{=}} 1, 2, ..., ''m''}}.

Once one has measured the system, one knows its current state; and this prevents it from being in one of its other state ⁠— it has apparently [[decoherence|decohered]] from them without prospects of future strong quantum interference.&lt;ref name="Quantum Theory and Pictures of Reality"&gt;B.D'Espagnat, P.Eberhard, W.Schommers, [[Franco Selleri|F.Selleri]].

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that the type of measurement one performs on the system affects the end-state of the system.

An experimentally studied situation related to this is the [[quantum Zeno effect]], in which a quantum state would decay if left alone, but does not decay because of its continuous observation. The dynamics of a quantum system under continuous observation are described by a quantum [[stochastic]] master equation known as the [[Belavkin equation]].&lt;ref name=Belavkin89&gt;{{cite journal

When discussing the wave function {{mvar|ψ}} which describes the state of a system in quantum mechanics, one should be cautious of a common misconception that assumes that the wave function {{mvar|ψ}} amounts to the same thing as the physical object it describes. This flawed concept must then require existence of an external mechanism, such as the mind of a conscious observer, that lies outside the principles governing the time evolution of the wave function {{mvar|ψ}}, in order to account for the so-called "collapse of the wave function" after a measurement has been performed. But the wave function {{mvar|ψ}} is ''not a physical object'' like, for example, an atom, which has an observable mass, charge and spin, as well as internal degrees of freedom. Instead, {{mvar|ψ}} is an ''abstract mathematical function'' that contains all the ''statistical'' information that an observer can obtain from measurements of a given system. In this case, there is no real mystery in that this mathematical form of the wave function {{mvar|ψ}} must change abruptly after a measurement has been performed.

In the ambit of the so-called [[hidden-measurements interpretation]] of quantum mechanics, the observer-effect can be understood as an ''instrument effect'' which results from the combination of the following two aspects: (a) an invasiveness of the measurement process, intrinsically incorporated in its experimental protocol (which therefore cannot be eliminated); (b) the presence of a random mechanism (due to fluctuations in the experimental context) through which a specific measurement-interaction is each time actualized, in a non-predictable (non-controllable) way.&lt;ref name=Sassoli2013&gt;Sassoli de Bianchi, M. (2013). The Observer Effect. [[Foundations of Science]] 18, pp. 213-243, arXiv:1109.3536.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sassoli2014&gt;Sassoli de Bianchi, M. (2015). God may not play dice, but human observers surely do. [[Foundations of Science]] 20, pp. 77-105, arXiv:1208.0674.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AertsSassoli2014d&gt;Aerts, D. and Sassoli de Bianchi, M.

A consequence of [[Bell's theorem]] is that measurement on one of two [[quantum entanglement|entangled]] particles can appear to have a nonlocal effect on the other particle. Additional problems related to [[quantum decoherence#In interpretations of quantum mechanics|decoherence]] arise when the observer is modeled as a quantum system, as well.

The [[uncertainty principle]] has been frequently confused with the observer effect, evidently even by its originator, [[Werner Heisenberg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/heisenbergs-uncertainty-principle-is-not-dead/|title=One Thing Is Certain: Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle Is Not Dead|last=Furuta|first=Aya|work=Scientific American|access-date=2018-09-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The uncertainty principle in its standard form describes how [[accuracy and precision|precisely]] we may measure the position and momentum of a particle at the same time &amp;mdash; if we increase the precision in measuring one quantity, we are forced to lose precision in measuring the other.&lt;ref name="heisenberg"&gt;[[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg, W.]] (1930), ''Physikalische Prinzipien der Quantentheorie'', Leipzig: Hirzel English translation ''The Physical Principles of Quantum Theory''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10813">{{Environmental law}}
In [[environmental law]], the '''polluter pays principle''' is enacted to make the [[Party (law)|party]] responsible for producing [[pollution]] responsible for paying for the damage done to the [[natural environment]]. It is regarded as a regional custom because of the strong support it has received in most [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) and [[European Union]] countries. It is a fundamental principle in US environmental law.

== History ==
According to the French [[historian of the environment]] Jean-Baptiste Fressoz, [[financial compensation]] (not named "polluter pays principle" at that time) is already the regulation principle of [[Industrial pollution|pollution]] favoured by industrials in the nineteenth century.&lt;ref name=Ulmi&gt;{{fr}} Nic Ulmi, [https://www.letemps.ch/sciences/2016/10/18/aux-origines-crise-ecologique "Aux origines de la crise écologique"] [The origins of the ecological crisis], ''[[Le temps]]'', 18 October 2016 (page visited on 22 October 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote that: "This principle, which is now offered as a new solution, actually accompanied the process of industrialisation, and was intended by the manufacturers themselves."&lt;ref name=Ulmi/&gt;

== Applications in environmental law==
The polluter pays principle underpins environmental policy such as an [[ecotax]], which, if enacted by government, deters and essentially reduces [[greenhouse gas emissions]]. This principle is based on the fact that as much as pollution is unavoidable, the person or industry that is responsible for the pollution must pay some money for the rehabilitation of the polluted environment.

===Australia===
The state of [[New South Wales]] in [[Australia]] has included the polluter pay principle with the other principles of [[ecologically sustainable development]] in the objectives of the Environment Protection Authority.&lt;ref&gt;Protection of the Environment Administration Act 1991, section 6(2)(d)(i)[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/poteaa1991485/s6.html].&lt;/ref&gt;

===European Union===
The polluter pays principle is set out in the [[Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union]] &lt;ref&gt;Article 191(2) TFEU&lt;/ref&gt; and Directive 2004/35/EC of the [[European Parliament]] and of the [[European Council|Council]] of 21 April 2004 on environmental liability with regard to the prevention and remedying of environmental damage is based on this principle. The directive entered into force on 30 April 2004; member states were allowed three years to transpose the [[Directive (European Union)|directive]] into their domestic law and by July 2010 all member states had completed this.&lt;ref&gt;European Commission, [http://ec.europa.eu/environment/legal/liability/ Environmental Liability], accessed 29 October 2017&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== France ===
In France, the Charter for the Environment contains a formulation of the polluter pays principle (article 4):
{{Block quote|Everyone shall be required, in the conditions provided for by law, to contribute to the making good of any damage he or she may have caused to the environment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.conseil-constitutionnel.fr/conseil-constitutionnel/root/bank_mm/anglais/charter_environnement.pdf ''Charter for the Environment''], [[Constitutional Council (France)|Constitutional Council]] (page visited on 28 August 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Ghana===
In [[Ghana]], the polluter pays principle was adopted in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;Ghana Business News, [https://www.ghanabusinessnews.com/2011/12/08/cabinet-approves-polluter-pays-principle/ Cabinet approves Polluter Pays Principle], 8 December 2011, accessed 29 October 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sweden===
The polluter pays principle is also known as '''extended producer responsibility''' (EPR). This is a concept that was probably first described by Thomas Lindhqvist for the [[Swedish government]] in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;The International Institute for Industrial Environmental Economics at Lund University, Sweden (2000).[http://www.lub.lu.se/luft/diss/tec355.pdf "Extended Producer Responsibility in Cleaner Production"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140513010736/http://www.lub.lu.se/luft/diss/tec355.pdf |date=2014-05-13 }} Doctoral Dissertation (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; EPR seeks to shift the responsibility of dealing with waste from [[government]]s (and thus, [[taxpayer]]s and society at large) to the entities producing it. In effect, it internalised the cost of waste disposal into the cost of the product, theoretically meaning that the producers will improve the waste profile of their products, thus decreasing waste and increasing possibilities for reuse and recycling.

The [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] defines extended producer responsibility as: &lt;blockquote&gt;
a concept where manufacturers and importers of products should bear a significant degree of responsibility for the environmental impacts of their products throughout the product life-cycle, including upstream impacts inherent in the selection of materials for the products, impacts from manufacturers’ production process itself, and downstream impacts from the use and disposal of the products. Producers accept their responsibility when designing their products to minimise life-cycle environmental impacts, and when accepting legal, physical or socio-economic responsibility for environmental impacts that cannot be eliminated by design.&lt;ref&gt;Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). Environment Directorate, Paris, France (2006).[http://www.oecd.org/document/53/0,3343,en_2649_34395_37284725_1_1_1_1,00.html "Extended Producer Responsibility."] Project Fact Sheet.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Switzerland ===
The [[waste management in Switzerland]] is based on the polluter pays principle.&lt;ref name=Skjellaug/&gt; [[Bin bag]]s (for [[municipal solid waste]]) are taxed with [[Pay as you throw|pay-per-bag fees]] in three quarters of the [[Municipalities of Switzerland|communes]] (and the recycling rate doubled in twenty years).&lt;ref name=Skjellaug&gt;{{fr}} Aïna Skjellaug, [https://www.letemps.ch/suisse/2016/09/06/lautre-or-suisse-dechets "L’autre or de la Suisse, ses déchets"], ''[[Le temps]]'', Tuesday 6 September 2016 (page visited on 6 September 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
The Environmental Damage (Prevention and Remediation) Regulations 2009 (for England) and the Environmental Damage (Prevention and Remediation) (Wales) Regulations 2009 (for Wales) established the operation of the polluter pays principle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20130402182915/http://archive.defra.gov.uk/environment/policy/liability/pdf/quick-guide-regs09.pdf The Environmental Damage Regulations: Preventing and Remedying Environmental Damage], accessed 29 October 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
The principle is employed in all of the major US pollution control laws: [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/enforcement/air-enforcement |title=Air Enforcement |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2015-12-01 |publisher=US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) |location=Washington, D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Clean Water Act]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/enforcement/water-enforcement |title=Water Enforcement |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2015-12-14 |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Resource Conservation and Recovery Act]] (solid waste and hazardous waste management),&lt;ref name="EPA-waste"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/enforcement/waste-chemical-and-cleanup-enforcement |title=Waste, Chemical, and Cleanup Enforcement |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2016-01-07 |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Superfund]] (cleanup of abandoned waste sites).&lt;ref name="EPA-waste"/&gt;

Some eco-taxes underpinned by the polluter pays principle include:
* the [[Gas Guzzler Tax]] for motor vehicles
* [[Corporate Average Fuel Economy]] (CAFE), a "polluter pays" [[Fine (penalty)|fine]].
* the Superfund law requires polluters to pay for cleanup of hazardous waste sites, when the polluters can be identified.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite report |date=June 1996 |title=The Buck Stops Here: Polluters are Paying for Most Hazardous Waste Cleanups |periodical=Superfund Today (newsletter) |url=http://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyPURL.cgi?Dockey=10001XKT.txt |publisher=EPA |id=EPA-540-K-96/004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, an [[Polluter pays amendment|amendment]] was passed negating the "polluter pays" provision of the [[Constitution of Florida|Florida Constitution]].

====Limitations of polluter pays principle====
The US [[Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) has observed that the polluter pays principle has typically not been fully implemented in [[United States environmental law|US laws]] and programs. For example, [[water purification|drinking water]] and [[sewage treatment]] services are [[subsidy|subsidized]] and there are limited mechanisms in place to fully assess polluters for treatment costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |date=2003 |title=Water and Wastewater Pricing: An Informational Overview |url=http://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyPDF.cgi/901U1200.PDF?Dockey=901U1200.PDF |publisher=EPA |id=EPA-832-F-03-027}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Zimbabwe===
The [[Zimbabwe]] Environmental Management Act of 2002 &lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.kubatana.net/docs/legisl/env_mgmt_act_060325.pdf Chapter 20:27]&lt;/ref&gt; prohibits the discharge of pollutants into the environment. In line with the "Polluter Pays" principle, the Act requires a polluter to meet the cost of decontaminating the polluted environment.&lt;ref&gt;The Herald (Harare), [http://www.herald.co.zw/polluter-pays-as-environmental-management-principle/ Polluter pays as environmental management principle], 18 May 2016, accessed 6 November 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2299">In [[mathematics]], the '''relative interior''' of a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] is a refinement of the concept of the [[interior (topology)|interior]], which is often more useful when dealing with low-dimensional sets placed in higher-dimensional spaces.

Formally, the relative interior of a set ''S'' (denoted &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{relint}(S)&lt;/math&gt;) is defined as its [[interior (topology)|interior]] within the [[affine hull]] of ''S''.&lt;ref name="Zalinescu"&gt;{{cite book|last=Zălinescu|first=C.|title=Convex analysis in general vector spaces|publisher=World Scientific Publishing&amp;nbsp; Co.,&amp;nbsp;Inc|location=River Edge,&amp;nbsp;NJ|year= 2002|pages=2–3|isbn=981-238-067-1|mr=1921556}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words,
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{relint}(S) := \{ x \in S : \exists\epsilon &gt; 0, N_\epsilon(x) \cap \operatorname{aff}(S) \subseteq S \},&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{aff}(S)&lt;/math&gt; is the affine hull of ''S'', and &lt;math&gt;N_\epsilon(x)&lt;/math&gt; is a [[ball (mathematics)|ball]] of radius &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; centered on &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;. Any metric can be used for the construction of the ball; all metrics define the same set as the relative interior.

For any nonempty [[convex set]] &lt;math&gt;C \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; the relative interior can be defined as
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{relint}(C) := \{x \in C : \forall {y \in C} \; \exists {\lambda &gt; 1}: \lambda x + (1-\lambda)y \in C\}.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Rockafellar, R.

'''Saṃsāra''' (Sanskrit, Pali; also ''samsara'') in [[Buddhism]] is the beginningless cycle of repeated [[Rebirth (Buddhism)|birth]], mundane existence and dying again.{{sfn|Trainor|2004|p=58, '''Quote:''' "Buddhism shares with Hinduism the doctrine of Samsara, whereby all beings pass through an unceasing cycle of birth, death and rebirth until they find a means of liberation from the cycle. However, Buddhism differs from Hinduism in rejecting the assertion that every human being possesses a changeless [[soul]] which constitutes his or her ultimate identity, and which transmigrates from one incarnation to the next.}} Samsara is considered to be ''[[dukkha]]'', unsatisfactory and painful,{{sfn|Wilson|2010}} perpetuated by desire and ''[[Avidyā (Buddhism)|avidya]]'' (ignorance), and the resulting [[karma]].{{sfn|Juergensmeyer|Roof|2011|p=271-272}}{{sfn|McClelland|2010|p=172, 240}}{{sfn|Williams|Tribe|Wynne|2012|p=18–19, chapter 1}}

Rebirths occur in six realms of existence, namely three good realms (heavenly, demi-god, human) and three evil realms (animal, ghosts, hellish).{{refn|group=note|name=realms2|Earlier Buddhist texts refer to five realms rather than six realms; when described as five realms, the god realm and demi-god realm constitute a single realm.{{sfn|Buswell|2004|p=711-712}}}} Samsara ends if a person attains [[nirvana]],{{refn|group=note|name=nirvanakc}} the "blowing out" of the desires and the gaining of true insight into [[anicca|impermanence]] and [[anatta|non-self]] reality.{{sfn|Buswell|Gimello|1992|p=7–8, 83–84}}{{sfn|Choong|1999|p=28–29, Quote: "Seeing (''passati'') the nature of things as impermanent leads to the removal of the view of self, and so to the realisation of nirvana."}}{{sfn|Rahula|2014|p=51-58}}

==Characteristics==
In Buddhism, ''saṃsāra'' is the "suffering-laden cycle of life, death, and rebirth, without beginning or end".{{sfn|Wilson|2010}}{{sfn|Laumakis|2008|p=97}} In several suttas of the [[Samyutta Nikaya]]'s chapter XV in particular it's said "From an inconstruable beginning comes transmigration. A beginning point is not evident, though beings hindered by ignorance and fettered by craving are transmigrating &amp; wandering on".&lt;ref&gt;http://suttacentral.net/en/sn15.3 - SN 15.3 Assu-sutta&lt;/ref&gt; It is the never ending repetitive cycle of birth and death, in six realms of reality (''gati'', domains of existence),{{sfn|Bowker|1997}} wandering from one life to another life with no particular direction or purpose.{{sfn|Gethin|1998|p=119}}{{sfn|Ajahn Sucitto|2010|pp=37-38}}{{refn|group=note|name="realms"|Samsara is the continual repetitive cycle of rebirth within the six realms of existence:
* Damien Keown: "Although Buddhist doctrine holds that neither the beginning of the process of cyclic rebirth nor its end can ever be known with certainty, it is clear that the number of times a person may be reborn is almost infinite. This process of repeated rebirth is known as saṃsāra or 'endless wandering', a term suggesting continuous movement like the flow of a river. All living creatures are part of this cyclic movement and will continue to be reborn until they attain nirvana."{{sfn|Keown|2000|loc=Kindle locations 702-706}}
* Ajahn Sucitto: "This continued movement is [...] what is meant by samsāra, the wandering on. According to the Buddha, this process doesn't even stop with death—it's like the habit transfers almost genetically to a new consciousness and body."{{sfn|Ajahn Sucitto|2010|pp=37-38}}}} Samsara is characterized by ''[[dukkha]]'' ("unsatisfactory," "painful").{{refn|group=note|Samsara is characterized by ''dukkha'':
* Chogyam Trungpa: "Samsara arises out of ignorance and is characterized by suffering."{{sfn|Chogyam Trungpa|2009|p=137}}
* Rupert Gethin: "This precisely is the nature of saṃsāra: wandering from life to life with no particular direction or purpose."{{sfn|Gethin|1998|p=119}}}} Every rebirth is temporary and impermanent. In each rebirth one is born and dies, to be reborn elsewhere in accordance with one's own karma.{{sfn|Williams|2002|pp=74-75}} It is perpetuated by one's ''[[Avidyā (Buddhism)|avidya]]'' ("ignorance"), particularly about ''[[anicca]]'' and ''[[anatta]]'',{{sfn|Keown|2004|pp=81, 281}}{{sfn|Fowler|1999|p=39–42}} and from craving.{{refn|group=note|name="Ignorance and craving"|Ignorance and craving:

===Mechanism===
The Saṃsāra doctrine of Buddhism asserts that while beings undergo endless cycles of rebirth, there is no changeless soul that transmigrates from one lifetime to another - a view that distinguishes its Saṃsāra doctrine from that in [[Hinduism]] and [[Jainism]].{{sfn|Trainor|2004|p=58, Quote: "Buddhism shares with Hinduism the doctrine of Samsara, whereby all beings pass through an unceasing cycle of birth, death and rebirth until they find a means of liberation from the cycle. However, Buddhism differs from Hinduism in rejecting the assertion that every human being possesses a changeless soul which constitutes his or her ultimate identity, and which transmigrates from one incarnation to the next.}}&lt;ref name=naomiappleton76&gt;{{cite book|author=Naomi Appleton |title=Narrating Karma and Rebirth: Buddhist and Jain Multi-Life Stories |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AhT7AgAAQBAJ |year=2014|publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-1-139-91640-0|pages=76–89 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This no-soul (no-self) doctrine is called the ''[[Anatta]]'' or ''Anatman'' in Buddhist texts.&lt;ref name=britannicaanatta&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/topic/anatta Anatta Buddhism], Encyclopædia Britannica (2013)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=anatta3sources&gt;[a] {{cite book|author=Christmas Humphreys|title=Exploring Buddhism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V3rYtmCZEIEC |year=2012|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-22877-3 |pages=42–43 }}&lt;br&gt;[b] {{cite book|author=Brian Morris |title=Religion and Anthropology: A Critical Introduction |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PguGB_uEQh4C&amp;pg=PA51 |year=2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-85241-8|pages=51 }}, '''Quote:''' "(...) anatta is the doctrine of non-self, and is an extreme empiricist doctrine that holds that the notion of an unchanging permanent self is a fiction and has no reality. According to Buddhist doctrine, the individual person consists of five skandhas or heaps - the body, feelings, perceptions, impulses and consciousness. The belief in a self or soul, over these five skandhas, is illusory and the cause of suffering."&lt;br&gt;[c] {{cite book|author=Richard Gombrich|title=Theravada Buddhism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jZyJAgAAQBAJ|year=2006|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-90352-8|page=47}}, '''Quote:''' "(...) Buddha's teaching that beings have no soul, no abiding essence. This 'no-soul doctrine' (anatta-vada) he expounded in his second sermon."&lt;/ref&gt;

The early Buddhist texts suggest that Buddha faced a difficulty in explaining what is reborn and how rebirth occurs, after he innovated the concept that there is "no self" (''Anatta'').&lt;ref name="Kalupahana1975p115"&gt;{{cite book|author=David J. Kalupahana|title=Causality: The Central Philosophy of Buddhism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GOYGAAAAYAAJ|year=1975|publisher=University Press of Hawaii|isbn=978-0-8248-0298-1|pages=115–119}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later Buddhist scholars, such as the mid-1st millennium CE Pali scholar [[Buddhaghosa]], suggested that the lack of a self or soul does not mean lack of continuity; and the rebirth across different realms of birth – such as heavenly, human, animal, hellish and others – occurs in the same way that a flame is transferred from one candle to another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David J. Kalupahana|title=Causality: The Central Philosophy of Buddhism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GOYGAAAAYAAJ|year=1975|publisher=University Press of Hawaii|isbn=978-0-8248-0298-1|page=83}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=William H.

The mechanistic details of the Samsara doctrine vary within the Buddhist traditions. [[Theravada]] Buddhists assert that rebirth is immediate while the [[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan]] schools hold to the notion of a [[bardo]] (intermediate state) that can last up to forty-nine days before the being is reborn.{{sfn|Robert Buswell|Donald Lopez|2013|pp=49-50, 708-709}}&lt;ref&gt;Macmillan ''Encyclopedia of Buddhism''.

Buddhist cosmology typically identifies six realms of rebirth and existence: gods, demi-gods, humans, animals, hungry ghosts and hells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Patrul Rinpoche|author2=Dalai Lama|title=The Words of My Perfect Teacher: A Complete Translation of a Classic Introduction to Tibetan Buddhism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=40i38mGQ6aAC&amp;pg=PA61|year=1998|publisher=Rowman Altamira|isbn=978-0-7619-9027-7|pages=61–99}}&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier Buddhist texts refer to five realms rather than six realms; when described as five realms, the god realm and demi-god realm constitute a single realm.{{sfn|Buswell|2004|p=711-712}}

* '''Demon, Anti-god or Demi-god realm:'''{{sfn|Trainor|2004|p=62}} the demi-gods ([[Asura (Buddhism)|asura]]s){{sfn|McClelland|2010|p=136}} is the second realm of existence in Buddhism.

They fight with the ''Devas'' (gods), or trouble the ''Manusya'' (humans) through illnesses and natural disasters.{{sfn|Trainor|2004|p=62}} They accumulate karma, and are reborn.
* '''Human realm:'''{{sfn|Trainor|2004|p=62}} called the ''[[Human beings in Buddhism|manuṣya]]'' realm.{{sfn|McClelland|2010|p=136}} Buddhism asserts that one is reborn in this realm with vastly different physical endowments and moral natures because of a being's past karma. A rebirth in this realm is considered as fortunate because it offers an opportunity to attain nirvana and end the Saṃsāra cycle.{{sfn|Trainor|2004|p=62}}{{Sfn|Keown|2013|pp=36-37}}

* '''Hungry ghost realm:'''{{sfn|Trainor|2004|p=62}} hungry ghosts and other restless spirits ([[preta]]){{sfn|McClelland|2010|p=136}} are rebirths caused by karma of excessive craving and attachments. They do not have a body, are invisible and constitute only "subtle matter" of a being. Buddhist texts describe them as beings who are extremely thirsty and hungry, very small mouths but very large stomachs.{{Sfn|Keown|2013|p=36}} Buddhist traditions in Asia attempt to care for them on ritual days every year, by leaving food and drinks in open, to feed any hungry ghosts nearby.{{sfn|Trainor|2004|p=62}} When their bad karma demerit runs out, these beings are reborn into another realm. According to McClelland, this realm is the mildest of the three evil realms.{{sfn|McClelland|2010|p=114, 199}} According to Yangsi Rinpoche, in contrast, the suffering of the beings born in the realm of the hungry ghosts is far more intense than those born in the animal realm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Yangsi Rinpoche|title=Practicing the Path: A Commentary on the Lamrim Chenmo|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wjM6AwAAQBAJ |year=2012|publisher=Wisdom Publications|isbn=978-0-86171-747-7|page=122}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Hell realm:'''{{sfn|Trainor|2004|p=63}} beings in hell ([[Naraka (Buddhism)|naraka]]){{sfn|McClelland|2010|p=136}} enter this realm for evil karma such as theft, lying, adultery and others. The texts vary in their details, but typically describe numerous hellish regions each with different forms of intense suffering, such as eight extremely hot hellish realms, eight extremely cold, being partially eaten alive, beating and other forms of torture in proportion to the evil karma accumulated.{{sfn|Trainor|2004|p=62}} These beings are reborn in another realm after their evil karma has run its course, they die, and they get another chance.{{Sfn|Keown|2013|p=36}} This realm is not similar to afterlife hell in Christianity, states Damien Keown, because in Buddhism there is no realm of final damnation and existence in this realm is also a temporary state.{{Sfn|Keown|2013|p=36}}

==Cause and end==
Samsara is perpetuated by one's karma, which is caused by craving and [[Avidyā (Buddhism)|ignorance]] (''avidya'').{{sfn|Keown|2004|pp=81, 281}}{{sfn|Fowler|1999|p=39–42}}{{refn|group=note|name="Ignorance and craving"}}

===Karma===
{{Main|Karma in Buddhism}}

Samsara is perpetuated by karma.{{refn|group=note|The driving force behind rebirth in the six realms of samsara is karma:
* Peter Harvey: "The movement of beings between rebirths is not a haphazard process but is ordered and governed by the law of karma, the principle that beings are reborn according to the nature and quality of their past actions; they are 'heir' to their actions (M.III.123)."{{sfn|Harvey|1990|p=39}}
* Damien Keown: "In the cosmology [of the realms of existence], karma functions as the elevator that takes people from one floor of the building to another. Good deeds result in an upward movement and bad deeds in a downward one. Karma is not a system of rewards and punishments meted out by God but a kind of natural law akin to the law of gravity. Individuals are thus the sole authors of their good and bad fortune."{{sfn|Keown|2000|loc=Kindle Location 794-797}}
* Sogyal Rinpoche states: "The kind of birth we will have in the next life is determined, then, by the nature of our actions in this one. And it is important never to forget that the effect of our actions depends entirely upon the intention or motivation behind them, and not upon their scale."{{sfn|Sogyal Rinpoche|2009|p=97}}
* Rupert Gethin: "What determines in which realm a being is born? The short answer is karma (Pali kamma): a being’s intentional ‘actions’ of body, speech, and mind—whatever is done, said, or even just thought with definite intention or volition. In general, though with some qualification, rebirth in the lower realms is considered to be the result of relatively unwholesome (akuśala/akusala), or bad (pāpa) karma, while rebirth in the higher realms the result of relatively wholesome (kuśala/kusala), or good (puṇya/puñña) karma."{{sfn|Gethin|1998|p=119}}
* Paul Williams: "short of attaining enlightenment, in each rebirth one is born and dies, to be reborn elsewhere in accordance with the completely impersonal causal nature of one's own karma; this endless cycle of birth, rebirth, and redeath is ''Saṃsāra''."{{sfn|Williams|2002|pp=74-75}}}} Karma or 'action' results from an intentional physical or mental act, which causes a future consequence.{{refn|group=note|Aṅguttara Nikāya III.415: "It is "intention" that I call karma; having formed the intention, one performs acts (karma) by body, speech and mind.{{sfn|Gethin|1998|p= 120}}}} Gethin explains:
{{quote|Thus acts of body and speech are driven by an underlying intention or will ([[cetanā]]), and they are unwholesome or wholesome because they are motivated by unwholesome or wholesome intentions. Acts of body and speech are, then, the end products of particular kinds of mentality. At the same time karma can exist as a simple 'act of will', a forceful mental intention or volition that does not lead to an act of body or speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Rupert Gethin|title=The Foundations of Buddhism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FUwSDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA120|year=1998|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-289223-2|page=120}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the Buddhist view, therefore, the type of birth one has in this life is determined by actions or ''karma'' from the previous lives; and the circumstances of the future rebirth are determined by the actions in the current and previous lives.{{refn|group=note|Padmasambhava: "If you want to know your past life, look into your present condition; if you want to know your future life, look at your present actions."{{sfn|Sogyal Rinpoche|2009|p=97}} }}

===Craving and ignorance===
Inconsistencies in the oldest texts show that the Buddhist teachings on craving and ignorance, and the means to attain liberation, evolved, either during the lifetime of the Buddha, or thereafter.{{refn|group=note|See:&lt;br&gt;* Erich Frauwallner (1953), ''Geschichte der indischen Philosophie'', Band  ''Der Buddha und der Jina'' (pp. 147-272)&lt;br&gt;* Andre Bareau (1963), ''Recherches sur la biographie du Buddha dans les Sutrapitaka et les Vinayapitaka anciens'', Ecole Francaise d'Extreme-Orient&lt;br&gt;* Schmithausen, ''On some Aspects of Descriptions or Theories of 'Liberating Insight' and 'Enlightenment' in Early Buddhism''&lt;br&gt;* K.R.

The later Buddhist tradition considers [[Avidyā (Buddhism)|ignorance]] (''avidya'') to be the root cause of samsara.{{sfn|Vetter|1988|p=xxi}}{{sfn|Keown|2004|pp=81, 281}}{{sfn|Fowler|1999|p=39–42}} Avidya is misconception and ignorance about reality, leading to grasping and clinging, and repeated rebirth.{{sfn|Edelglass|2009|p=3-4}}{{sfn|Laumakis|2008|p=136}} According to Paul Williams, "it is the not-knowingness of things as they truly are, or of oneself as one really is."{{sfn|Williams|Tribe|Wynne|2012|p=46–47}} It can be overcome by insight into the true nature of reality. In the later Buddhist tradition "liberating insight" came to be regarded as equally liberating as the practice of ''dhyana''.{{sfn|Gombrich|1997|p=99-102}}{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=93-111}} According to Vetter and Bronkhorst, this happened in response to other religious groups in India, who held that a liberating insight was an indispensable requisite for ''moksha'', liberation from rebirth.{{sfn|Vetter|1988|p=xxxii, xxxiii}}{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=54-55, 96, 99}}{{refn|group=note|Tillmann Vetter: "Very likely the cause was the growing influence of a non-Buddhist spiritual environment·which claimed that one can be released only by some truth or higher knowledge. In addition, the alternative (and perhaps sometimes competing) method of discriminating insight (fully established after the introduction of the four noble truths) seemed to conform so well to this claim."{{sfn|Vetter|1988|p=xxxiii}}&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to Bronkhorst, this happened under influence of the "mainstream of meditation," that is, Vedic-Brahmanical oriented groups, which believed that the cessation of action could not be liberating, since action can never be fully stopped. Their solution was to postulate a fundamental difference between the inner soul or self and the body. The inner self is unchangeable, and unaffected by actions. By insight into this difference, one was liberated. To equal this emphasis on insight, Buddhists presented insight into their most essential teaching as equally liberating. What exactly was regarded as the central insight "varied along with what was considered most central to the teaching of the Buddha."{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=54-55, 96, 99}}}}

The ideas on what exactly constituted this "liberating insight" evolved over time.{{sfn|Vetter|1988|p=xxi-xxxvii}}{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=chapter 7}} Initially the term ''prajna'' served to denote this "liberating insight." Later on, ''prajna'' was replaced in the suttas by the [[Four Noble Truths|four truths]].{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=99-100, 102-111}}{{sfn|Anderson|1999}} This happened in those texts where "liberating insight" was preceded by the four jhanas, and where this practice of the four jhanas then culminates in "liberating insight."{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=108}}{{refn|group=note|In the Nikayas the four truths are given as the "liberating insight" which constituted the [[Enlightenment in Buddhism|awakening]], or "enlightenment" of the Buddha. When he understood these truths, he was "enlightened," and liberated, as reflected in Majjhima Nikaya 26:42: "his taints are destroyed by his seeing with wisdom."{{sfn|Bhikkhu Nanamoli (translator)|1995|p=268}} Typically, the four truths refer here to the eightfold path as the means to gain liberation, while the attainment of insight in the four truths is portrayed as liberating in itself.{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993}}}} The four truths were superseded by ''pratityasamutpada'', and still later, in the Hinayana schools, by the doctrine of the non-existence of a substantial self or person.{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=100-101}} And Schmithausen states that still other descriptions of this "liberating insight" exist in the Buddhist canon: 
{{quote|"that the five Skandhas are impermanent, disagreeable, and neither the Self nor belonging to oneself";{{refn|group=note|Majjhima Nikaya 26}} "the contemplation of the arising and disappearance (''udayabbaya'') of the five Skandhas";{{refn|group=note|Anguttara Nikaya II.45 (PTS)}} "the realisation of the Skandhas as empty (''rittaka''), vain (''tucchaka'') and without any pith or substance (''asaraka'').{{refn|group=note|Samyutta Nikaya III.140-142 (PTS)}}{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=101}}}}

===Liberation===

Samsara ends when one attains ''[[moksha]]'', liberation.{{sfn|Williams|Tribe|Wynne|2012|pp=30–42}}{{sfn|Robert Buswell |Donald Lopez |2013|pp=304-305}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Harvey|editor=Steven M.

In later Buddhism insight becomes predominant, for example the recognition and acceptance of non-self, also called the [[anatta]] doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Melford E. Spiro|title=Buddhism and Society: A Great Tradition and Its Burmese Vicissitudes|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GnYou0owQ5MC|year=1982|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-04672-6|page=84}}&lt;/ref&gt; One who no longer sees any soul or self, concludes Walpola Rahula, is the one who has been liberated from the samsara suffering cycles.{{sfn|Rahula|2014|p=51-58}}{{refn|group=note|Phra Thepyanmongkol: "The designation that is Nibbana [Nirvana] is anatta (non-self)", states Buddha, in ''Parivara Vinayapitaka''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Phra Thepyanmongkol|title=A Study Guide for Right Practice of the Three Trainings|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6XFW45RDK6wC|year=2012|publisher=Wat Luang Phor Sodh|isbn=978-974-401-378-1|pages=412–418}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} The theme that Nirvana is non-Self, states Peter Harvey, is recurring in early Buddhist texts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Harvey|editor=Steven M.

Some Buddhist texts suggest that rebirth occurs through the transfer of ''[[Consciousness (Buddhism)|vinnana]]'' (consciousness) from one life to another. When this consciousness ceases, then liberation is attained.{{sfn|Waldron|2003|p=22}} There is a connection between consciousness, karmic activities, and the cycle of rebirth, argues William Waldron, and with the destruction of vinnana, there is "destruction and cessation of "karmic activities" (anabhisankhara, S III, 53), which are considered in Buddhism to be "necessary for the continued perpetuation of cyclic existence."{{sfn|Waldron|2003|p=22}}

While Buddhism considers the liberation from samsara as the ultimate spiritual goal, in traditional practice, Buddhists seek and accumulate merit through good deeds, donations to monks and various Buddhist rituals in order to gain better rebirths rather than nirvana.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael D. Coogan|title=The Illustrated Guide to World Religions |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BshpqnbLOvQC| year=2003| publisher=Oxford University Press| isbn=978-0-19-521997-5| page=192}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychological interpretation==

According to Chogyam Trungpa the realms of samsara can refer to both "psychological states of mind and physical cosmological realms".{{refn|group=note|Chogyam Trungpa states: "In the Buddhist system of the six realms, the three higher realms are the god realm, the jealous-god realm, and the human realm; the three lower realms are the animal realm, the hungry ghost realmm, and the hell realm. These realms can refer to psychological states or to aspects of Buddhist cosmology."{{sfn|Chogyam Trungpa|2009|p=127}} }}

Gethin argues, rebirth in the different realms is determined by one's [[Karma in Buddhism|karma]], which is directly determined by one's psychological states. The Buddhist cosmology may thus be seen as a map of different realms of existence and a description of all possible psychological experiences.{{sfn|Gethin|1998|pp=119-120}} The psychological states of a person in current life lead to the nature of next rebirth in Buddhist cosmology.{{sfn|Gethin|1998|p=121}}

Paul Williams acknowledges Gethin's suggestion of the "principle of the equivalence of cosmology and psychology," but notes that Gethin is not asserting the Buddhist cosmology is really all about current or potential states of mind or psychology.{{sfn|Williams|2002|pp=78-79}} The realms in Buddhist cosmology are indeed realms of rebirths. Otherwise rebirth would always be into the human realm, or there would be no rebirth at all. And that is not traditional Buddhism, states Williams.{{sfn|Williams|2002|pp=78-79}}

David McMahan concludes that the attempts to construe ancient Buddhist cosmology in modern psychological terms is modernistic reconstruction, "detraditionalization and demythologization" of Buddhism, a sociological phenomenon that is seen in all religions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David L. McMahan|title=The Making of Buddhist Modernism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XU6HNwlxhCAC|year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-972029-3|pages=45–48, 57–58}}, '''Quote:''' "Clearly, the interaction of Buddhism with psychology exhibits aspects of both detraditionalization and demythologization as already described. In addition, the legitimacy that is granted Buddhism in its reconstrual as a kind of psychology reverberates back to the very conception of Buddhism among Buddhists themselves, (...)"&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''secret identity''' is a person's alter ego which is not known to the general populace, most often used in fiction. Brought into popular culture by [[the Scarlet Pimpernel]] in 1903, the concept is particularly prevalent in the [[American comic book]] genre, and is a more genre-specific version of the broader [[Trope (literature)|trope]] of the [[Masquerade (trope)|masquerade]].

In American comic books, a character typically has dual identities, with one identity being the [[superhero]] persona and the other being the secret identity. The secret identity is typically the superhero's civilian persona when they are not assuming the superhero persona. It is kept hidden from their enemies and the general public to protect themselves from legal ramifications, pressure, or public scrutiny, as well as to protect their friends and loved ones from harm secondary to their actions as superheroes.

The secret identity commonly consists of the superhero's given birth name and may involve an occupation they had before becoming a superhero. This is in contrast to the superhero identity, which often utilizes a [[pseudonym]] and sometimes a mask to complete a costume to conceal the superhero's secret identity. To help further preserve the anonymity of secret identities, characters may use eyeglasses, particular clothing, or display a different set of personal characteristics when assuming the secret identity persona. For example, the superhero [[Batman]]'s secret identity is Bruce Wayne, a billionaire who is known to the public for his affluent playboy lifestyle. Another example is [[Superman]], who does not wear a mask when he is in costume, but wears eyeglasses and appears mild-mannered when he assumes his secret identity of Clark Kent.

Types of characters that may have secret identities include heroes, [[superhero]]es, [[thief|thieves]], [[villain]]s, [[supervillain]]s, [[vigilante]]s, [[Extraterrestrials in fiction|alien]]s, and "[[monster]]s". A character may have several secret identities simultaneously, such as adopted names or [[undercover]] identities.

==History==

Myth and legend is filled with stories of gods or heroes who took on other identities for various purposes.  A significant precursor to the 20th century concept of a secret identity in fiction is ''[[The Count of Monte Cristo]]'' (1844) by [[Alexandre Dumas]], a huguely popular story which was frequently dramatized in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.  In this story, the protagonist Edmund Dantes takes on the identity of the mysterious Count of Monte Cristo in order to carry out his plan of revenge against the men who were responsible for his downfall and imprisonment.

Art by [[Brian Bolland]].]]
The modern popular culture use of secret identities begins in the early 20th century with characters such as [[the Scarlet Pimpernel]] (1903), [[Jimmie_Dale|Jimmie Dale, the Gray Seal]] (1914), [[Zorro]] (1919), and the [[Lone Ranger]] (1933). A line in the novel ''The Scarlet Pimpernel'' reads, "Because the Scarlet Pimpernel works in the dark, and his identity is only known under the solemn oath of secrecy to his immediate followers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Orczy|first1=Baroness|title=the Scarlet Pimpernel - CHAPTER IV THE LEAGUE OF THE SCARLET PIMPERNEL|date=2005|publisher=Hodder|location=London|isbn=0340894989}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Scarlet Pimpernel is the name of a chivalrous Englishman, Sir Percy Blakeney, who exhibits characteristics that would become standard superhero conventions, including the penchant for disguise, use of a signature weapon (sword), ability to out-think and outwit his adversaries, and a calling card (he leaves behind a [[Anagallis arvensis|scarlet pimpernel]] at each of his interventions).&lt;ref name="Robb"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Robb|first1=Brian J.|title=A Brief History of Superheroes: From Superman to the Avengers, the Evolution of Comic Book Legends|date=2014|publisher=Hatchet UK}}&lt;/ref&gt; By drawing attention to his alter ego Blakeney he hides behind his public face as a slow thinking foppish playboy (like [[Bruce Wayne]]), and he also establishes a network of supporters, The League of the Scarlet Pimpernel, that aid his endeavours.&lt;ref name="Robb"/&gt;

Starting in the 1930s, the concept of crime-fighters, [[superhero]]es, and [[vigilante]]s (and their adversaries) adopting secret identities became more widespread in [[dime novel]]s, [[pulp magazine]]s, [[comic book]]s, [[old-time radio|old-time]] [[radio drama]]s, [[Serial (film)|movie serials]], and other [[popular fiction]] and such characters remain popular to this day.  Superman appeared in ''[[Action Comics]]'' in 1938 as one of the forerunners amongst a [[list of superhero debuts]].

==Purpose==

The artistic purpose of the secret identity on the part of the writers is that it allows the characters to have ordinary lives, which can allow for human drama as well as create [[suspense|tension]] with the effort needed to preserve the secret.  This can include challenges such as throwing off the suspicions of associates who suspect, and the need to quickly improvise means to get out of sight to change identities.  And [[superhuman]] characters may benefit from an [[everyman]] aspect through having a secret identity, giving them a [[sympathy|sympathetic]] link to their audience.  For example, [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]]'s secret identity is a boy named Billy Batson - a deliberate attempt to play on the daydreams of a young readership.{{citation needed|date=December 2009}}

Some common [[motivation]]s for a character to keep a secret identity include:
*Allowing the character to live a "normal life" when not fighting crime.
*Preventing the hero's enemies from seeking revenge on others the hero may care about.
*Giving the hero an advantage in crime fighting (e.g. Batman or [[The Shadow]] striking fear into criminals).
*Gaining timely information on incidents as they happen, often through their occupation or that of their associates (e.g. a [[reporter]] or a [[newscaster]] would likely be more informed about incidents that a hero might be able to help with).
*Gaining information on criminal investigations or on crimes being planned (e.g., in his early days as Batman, Bruce Wayne would learn about ongoing investigations from [[Commissioner Jim Gordon|Commissioner Gordon]], while [[Plastic Man]]'s alter ego, criminal Eel O'Brien, would go along on other crimes, only to capture his cohorts as Plastic Man).
*[[Fictional extraterrestrials|Aliens]], upon coming to Earth, may choose to set up one or more secret identities as a ''learning tool''. By pretending to be humans, they can explore the different roles and lives that a regular human is expected to have in his/her life and using their deeper understanding of human condition to help others.
*To avoid legal ramifications or public scrutiny due to accountability with the collateral damage superheroes are often involved with, which carries the risk of imprisonment or becoming a public [[Outcast (person)|pariah]] such as from being branded as a [[vigilante]]. Villains such as the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]] also use this reason to hide their unlawful actions to protect their social standing.
*To allow the public to admire their super alter-ego as its own entity, not weakened by the mortality of their "normal" counterpart.

==The question of genuine identity==

Sometimes the distinction as to which persona is the "real one" may be blurred or confused, as has sometimes been the case with [[Clark Kent]] and [[Superman]]. In the earliest Superman comics, Clark's primary purpose was to fulfill the perceived requirement that a superhero cannot remain on full duty all the time and Clark thus acted as little more than a front for Superman's activities.  In the television series ''[[Lois &amp; Clark: The New Adventures of Superman]]'', after [[Lois Lane]] learns that Superman is Clark Kent, he discusses his dual identity with her. "Clark Kent is not a disguise. Clark is who I am, while Superman is what I do."  

The compromises that Clark still needed to make to secure his alter-egos were limited as the [[Jonathan and Martha Kent|Pa Kent]] of the ''Man of Steel'' comics enthusiastically explains: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;small&gt;"SEE MA? WITH HIS HAIR ALL SLICKERED BACK AND AN OLD PAIR OF MY SPECTACLES, HIS WHOLE FACE SEEMS TO CHANGE.  ALL HE NEEDS TO DO IS '''''STOOP''''' A TAD AND HE LOOKS LIKE A WHOLE DIFFERENT MAN.  AND SO LONG AS HE'S CAREFUL NEVER TO LET ON THAT HE '''''HAS''''' TWO SEPARATE IDENTITIES, HE'LL BE ABLE TO MOVE FREELY LIKE ORDINARY FOLKS!&lt;/small&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Man of Steel #1, Chapter2}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Beyond stooping, Clark develops a tendency of avoiding conflict.  Sometimes this is in order to allow him to change into his alter ego. while at other times it is to maintain a consistently non-Superman type image. In either case, it opens the "mild mannered" reporter to the [[Social stigma|stigma]] of cowardice and weakness. Superman's face remains uncovered on the justification that he wants to be trusted by people while [[Batman]] wears a mask partly because he wants to be feared by criminals.  It has also been suggested that [[Bruce Wayne]] is "the mask" that Batman wears, meaning that Batman is the true persona, hidden by his public image.

Heroes in this type of situation are known to find their love interests developing interests in and even infatuations for their heroic personas, as a dual identity can have an influence on romantic attraction. Lois Lane found herself attracted to Superman but is fairly indifferent towards Clark Kent and for years bore some resentment towards him. Similarly, [[Black Cat (Marvel Comics)|Black Cat]] was madly in love with [[Spider-Man]] but was utterly replused by his revelation as Peter Parker, which eventually led to their break-up. Following a reset that [[Mindwipe|erased her memory]] of his secret identity, Black Cat and Spider-Man have a strictly "masks-on" relationship whenever they engage in [[On-again, off-again relationship|on-again, off-again]] romance.

Characters who experience an actual transformation when changing from one persona may have two relatively genuine identities, albeit with additional possibilities of inner conflict.  An example of this is Dr. Robert Bruce Banner who needs to seek genuine calmness in order to prevent transforming into the genuinely raging [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]]. Other characters have abilities that help them conceal their identities such as: [[shapeshifting]] or [[mind control]].  For instance Marvel's [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]] has an unaltered form with features including blue skin and yellow eyes and yet she has shape shifting and vocal mimicry abilities give her the potential to fit into any required situation. At another extreme characters like [[He-Man]] manage to maintain their secret identities with a change of clothes and a [[Sun Tanning|tan]].

Some characters initially maintain secret identities but discard of them over time. [[Tony Stark]] at first told the news media and general public that [[Iron Man]] is his personal [[Bodyguard|bodyguard]] and corporate [[Mascot|mascot]] before he eventually publicly reveals his dual identity. Other characters miss the opportunity to conceal their identities or choose to be public from the very beginning. For instance, the [[Fantastic Four]], who would have always had difficulties concealing [[The Thing (comics)|the Thing]], have typically maintained a public appearance from the [[Manhattan]] based [[Baxter Building]]. Much like Iron Man, the members of the Fantastic Four have few surviving civilian relatives and most of their friends and loved ones have [[Superpower (ability)|superhuman abilities]] they can use to protect themselves from harm.

==Keeping the secret==

Unless an identity is itself well known, its discovery may not jeopardize the person's safety. For example, the ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' episode "The Great Brain Robbery" features [[Lex Luthor]] temporarily [[body swap]]ping with the Flash ([[Wally West]]). When Luthor tries to learn the hero's secret identity by taking off his mask and looking in a mirror, he realizes that he has "no idea who this is".&lt;ref name="sava20150112"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.avclub.com/tvclub/justice-league-unlimited-great-brain-robbery-213725 | title=Justice League Unlimited: “The Great Brain Robbery” | publisher=AV Club | date=2015-01-12 | accessdate=20 April 2016 | author=Sava, Oliver}}&lt;/ref&gt; If secret identities are to remain secret then others must fail to recognize and subsequently publicize that personas of a character belong to the same person.  Identities may be kept secret in a number of ways including: 
*[[Shapeshifting|actual physical change]]&lt;ref name="hulk"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Hulk: The Incredible Guide|last1=DeFalco|first1=Tom|date=5 May 2003|publisher=DK Publishing|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The application of elements of [[disguise]] on the various personas of the character 
*Becoming or remaining less visible due to: [[camouflage]], [[Transparency and translucency|transparency]], [[invisibility]] or [[vibration]] 
*the adoption of different mannerisms and vocal characteristics by the various personas of the character
*[[Toxicology|Chemical influences]], [[hypnosis]], [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]] and [[telepathy|telepathic]]/psychic influences
*The causation of [[Wound|physical damage]] with the result of [[Mental disorder|impaired mental ability]], [[Communication|impaired communicative ability]] or [[death]].
*Public appearances of both identities in the same area with the cooperation of a friend in disguise, or an [[android (robot)|android]] made to take that appearance, by some form of illusion or by such means as time travel.
*Does not display any of their special skills in public. (ex. Bruce Wayne not displaying his martial arts skills in public to protect his secret identity as Batman&lt;ref&gt;''Batman'' (vol. 2) #2 (December 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;)
*Has special abilities that help prevent from being observed changing identities, such as [[Spider-Man]]'s spider-sense, that senses when he is in danger, which registers unwanted observers at such moments as a threat.

'''''Sexing the Body: Gender Politics and the Construction of Sexuality''''' is a 2000 book by the biologist [[Anne Fausto-Sterling]], in which the author explores the social construction of gender, and the social and medical treatment of [[intersex]] people. She stated that in it she sets out to "convince readers of the need for theories that allow for a good deal of human variation and that integrate the analytical powers of the biological and the social into the systematic analysis of human development."&lt;ref name="Anne Fausto-Sterling 2000" /&gt;

== Synopsis ==

Fausto-Sterling  mentions the most common types of [[intersex]], congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS), gonadal dysgenesis, hypospadias, and unusual chromosome compositions such as XXY (Klinefelter Syndrome) or X0 (Turner Syndrome).&lt;ref name="Anne Fausto-Sterling 2000"&gt;Anne Fausto-Sterling (2000). Sexing the body: gender politics and the construction of sexuality. New York: Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt;

She gives [[John Money]]'s view of intersexuality by stating,: “Intersexuality, in Money's view, resulted from fundamentally ab-normal processes. Their patients required medical treatment because they ought to have become either a male or a female. The goal of treatment was to assure proper psychosexual development by assigning the young mixed-sex child to the proper gender…” &lt;ref name="Anne Fausto-Sterling 2000" /&gt; Money declared, "From the sum total of hermaphroditic evidence, the conclusion that emerges is that sexual behavior and orientation as male or female does not have an innate, instinctive basis.” Money is disproved in chapter 3 of Sexing the Body when it is stated that congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) girls tend to manufacture larger amounts of masculine hormones until birth and the production of these male hormones raises the question among scientist of whether or not the excess male hormones that a CAH girl produces has an effect on her brain development.&lt;ref name="Anne Fausto-Sterling 2000" /&gt;

Fausto-Sterling argues surgery on intersex babies should wait until the child can make an informed decision, and label surgery without consent as [[genital modification and mutilation|genital mutilation]]. In "Sexing the Body", Sterling describes the grueling process of transforming an intersex person into the desired sex, and the appearance of a "densely scarred and immobile penis" or “extensive suturing [or] skin transplants in such a way that it seems difficult for anyone to endure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sterlin|first=Anne|title=Sexing the body: gender politics and the construction  of sexuality|year=2000|publisher=Basic Books|location=Chapter 3|pages=62}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the decision should be made strictly by the parents without any coercion or influence presented by the doctor, it is ultimately the “physicians who decide how to manage intersexuality”.&lt;ref name="Sterlin 2000 48"&gt;{{cite book|last=Fausto-Sterling|first=Anne|title=Sexing the body: gender politics and the construction  of sexuality|year=2000|publisher=Basic Books|location=Chapter 3|pages=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; No matter how impartial they attempt to be, physicians simply “act out of, and perpetuate, deeply held beliefs about male and female sexuality, gender roles, and the (im)proper place of homosexuality in normal development” when performing the necessary surgery for the chosen gender.&lt;ref name="Sterlin 2000 48"/&gt;

Fausto-Sterling’s article titled “Of Gender and Genitals: The Use and Abuse of the Modern Intersexual” criticizes the standard model of sex and gender by using the case of intersex individuals by explaining how those individuals are neither male nor female so they do not fit in the sex binary. It is suggested that “bodies… only live within the productive constrains of certain highly regulatory schemas.” People must be “culturally intelligible as males or females”. While the standard model says that sex is biologically determined, Fausto-Sterling challenges this by stating “From the sum total of hermaphroditic evidence, the conclusion that emerges is that sexual behavior and orientation as male or female does not have an innate, instinctive basis."&lt;ref&gt;Fausto-Sterling, Anne “Of Gender and Genitals” from Sexing the body: gender politics and the construction  of sexuality New York, NY: Basic Books, 2000, [Chapter 3, pp. 46]&lt;/ref&gt;

Oftentimes, doctors decide the sex of an intersex infant immediately after birth. Doctors choose the sex based on what they believe a male or a female should look like. In essence, society decides what is male or female.  Fausto-Sterling portrays how our society puts a great deal of trust in doctors because they are seen as the experts and those who decide what nature tells us. Doctors for decades past have felt the need to immediately “correct” intersex children after birth. Fausto-Sterling states, “The attending physician, realizing that the newborn's genitalia are either/or, neither/both, consults a pediatric endocrinologist (children's hormone specialist) and a surgeon. They declare a state of medical emergency. According to current treatment standards, there is no time to waste in quiet reflection or open-ended consultations with the parents”.&lt;ref&gt;Fausto-Sterling, Anne “Of Gender and Genitals” from Sexing the body: gender politics and the construction  of sexuality New York, NY: Basic Books, 2000, [Chapter 3, pp. 45]&lt;/ref&gt; Doctors felt that this was a medical emergency because intersex children were seen as abnormal, and because we live in a society based on heternormativity, physicians were pressured to make anything abnormal, normal. Fausto-Sterling mentions that “no masculine women or effeminate men need apply.” These individuals are considered to be “unthinkable, abject, unlivable.” As this belief is deeply rooted in people’s mind, it is essential and imperative for “surgeons, psychologists, and endocrinologists, through their surgical skills, [to] try to make good facsimiles of culturally intelligible bodies.” Contrary to the belief that physicians thought it was vital to immediately decide a sex for an intersex child, evidence shows that just because science chooses a sex for a child that does not guarantee that the child will grow up to “fit” that gender role. For example, the article states, “These individuals seemed to be listening to some inner voice that said that everyone in authority surrounding h/her was wrong. Doctors and parents might have insisted that they were female, removed their testes, injected them with estrogen, and surgically provided them with a vagina, but still, they knew they were really males”.&lt;ref&gt;Fausto-Sterling, Anne “Of Gender and Genitals” from Sexing the body: gender politics and the construction  of sexuality New York, NY: Basic Books, 2000, [Chapter 3, pp. 69]&lt;/ref&gt; These individuals are the exception to the standard model and a prime example of why the standard model is not relevant. These types of people do not properly fit the sexual dimorphism so a more acceptable categorization would be the alternative model. The alternative model a spectrum with completely male on one side and completely female on the other, leaving room for sexually ambiguous humans to be categorized somewhere in between.

In "Of Gender and Genitals", Anne Fausto-Sterling illustrates how the standard model of the difference between sex and gender can be at times damaging and how it necessitates that doctors’ uphold to certain protocol in order to maintain it. She informs the reader that the extensive surgeries intersex children undergo soon after birth are both “unnecessary and sexually damaging”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fausto-Sterling|first=Anne|title="Of Gender and Genitals" from Sexing the Body: Gender Politics and the Construction of Sexuality|year=2000|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York, NY|pages=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; Infants, if born intersex, are subjected to a number of considerable surgeries as soon as they are born merely to uphold to society’s standard model. If society’s view changed to that of a gender-sex spectrum, these babies would be given the freedom to choose their own gender when they become of age. Unfortunately that was not the case in the past. Instead, for example, intersex babies, who were chosen to function as a male, experienced multiple surgeries “on their penises during the first couple of years of their lives”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fausto-Sterling|first=Anne|title="Of Gender and Genitals" from Sexing the Body: Gender Politics and the Construction of Sexuality|year=2000|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York, NY|pages=62}}&lt;/ref&gt; When dealing with the parents of intersex children, doctors must follow certain guidelines so as not to dishearten the parents’ of their children’s normality. Fausto-Sterling specifically references some doctors’ endeavor towards “discouraging any feeling of sexual ambiguity” for their children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fausto-Sterling|first=Anne|title="Of Gender and Genitals" from Sexing the Body: Gender Politics and the Construction of Sexuality|year=2000|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York, NY|pages=64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anne Fausto-Sterling says, "[o]ur conceptions of the nature of gender difference shape, even as they reflect, the ways we structure our social system and polity; they also shape and reflect our understanding of our physical bodies."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fausto-Sterling|first=Anne|title=Sexing the body:gender and politics and the construction of sexuality|year=2000|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York, NY|page=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kashmir 2016.png|thumb|Kashmiri youth throwing stones at Indian armed forces during 2016 Kashmir Unrest]]
'''Stone throwing''' or '''rock throwing''' is the act of throwing a [[stone]]. When it is directed at another person (called '''stone pelting''' in India), it is a form of criminal [[assault]].

==History==
Throwing of rocks or stones is one of the most ancient forms of ranged-weapon combat, with [[sling (weapon)|slings]] used to increase the range of such projectiles having been found among other weapons in the tomb of [[Tutankhamen]], who died about 1325 BC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ashmolean.museum/gri/carter/585y-p1324.html Image of sling from the Tomb of Tutankhamen] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060403131635/https://www.ashmolean.museum/gri/carter/585y-p1324.html |date=2006-04-03 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; In many places, rocks are readily available as weapons, more so than more sophisticated weapons. Because rocks are dense, hard objects, a forcefully thrown rock can do substantial damage to a target, particularly if the rock has sharp or jagged edges.

Historically, [[stoning]] was used as a method of [[human execution]] in several cultures.

==At vehicles==

Thrown rocks can kill in a number of ways; a rock can hit a passenger directly in the head with [[deadly force|lethal force]], a rock can strike the driver causing him or her to lose control of the car and crash, the "jolt and shock of a barrage of stones smashing against the front windshield" can cause the driver to lose control and crash, or the out of control vehicle can slam into a passing car, causing it to crash.&lt;ref name=Medoff&gt;[[Rafael Medoff]], [http://www.jns.org/latest-articles/2015/5/3/baltimore-riot-mom-needed-in-jerusalem#.VUmBPY6qqko= 'Baltimore ‘riot mom’ needed in Jerusalem,'] [[JNS.org]] 3 May 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal background===

In the 18th century, [[William Blackstone]] stated that throwing stones in a town or city on a highway, when it caused a death, was to be defined as [[manslaughter]] rather than murder.&lt;ref&gt;Sir [[William Blackstone]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=jiJAtfLSg_sC&amp;pg=PA174 ''A Summary of the Constitutional Laws of England Being an Abridgement of Blackstone's Commentaries,''] John Trusler 1796 pp.175-176&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Burnett, Robert Craigie [https://books.google.com/books?id=rNRLAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA30 ''A treatise on various branches of the criminal law of Scotland,''] Longman, Hurst, Rees, Orme, and Brown, London, 1811 p.30&lt;/ref&gt;

Many notorious and deadly riots have begun with rock throwing, or included rock throwing as violence escalated, including the Toronto [[Jubilee riots]], the [[Boston Massacre]], and the [[2014 Hrushevskoho Street riots]] in the Ukraine.

===Kashmir===
{{Main|Stone Pelting in Kashmir}}
{{see also|2018 Shopian firing incident}}
Throwing of stones at Indian Armed Forces and Police is frequent in the Indian province of [[Kashmir]]. Usually carried out by youths, in the local language it is called "Kanni Jung", which means ''fighting with stones'' and the stone pelters are called as ''Sangbaaz''.&lt;ref name="theanalystworld1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theanalystworld.com/stone-pelting-and-kashmiri-youth/ |title=Stone Pelting and Kashmiri Youth |publisher=The Analyst World |date=2014-06-20 |accessdate=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are claims that the rocks are thrown in response to killings of Kashmiri youth at the hands of forces.&lt;ref name="thehindu1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/Understanding-Kashmirs-stone-pelters/article16120870.ece |title=Understanding Kashmir's stone pelters |newspaper=[[The Hindu]] |date= |accessdate=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; But as per the [[Dailymail]], [[India Today]] Television's underground reporters interviewed some of the stonepelters where stonepelters revealed they are being paid 5000-7000 rupees per month and are being given some clothes and shoes by the Anti-India forces for pelting stones on Indian army.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/indiahome/indianews/article-4362020/Kashmiri-stone-pelters-admit-paid-film.html|title=This is our bread and butter': Undercover reporters film Kashmiri 'stone-pelters' admit to being paid Rs 7,000 a month for throwing stones and Molotovs at Indian forces|author=Jamshed Khan, Sushant Pathak|date=29 March 2017|access-date=5 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal background===
Rock throwing has been in the past often adopted as a method by an unarmed population to protest a governing power's authority. Under English [[common law]], soldiers were not permitted to shoot at civilians engaged in this kind of protest, unless their lives were in danger or they obtained beforehand an express order from a civil magistrate. &lt;blockquote&gt;At one point, when town officials tried to arrest a British officer who was commanding the guard at Boston Neck, Captain Ponsonby Molesworth intervened to confront a stone-throwing crowd. Molesworth ordered the soldiers to bayonet anyone throwing stones who got too close. A Boston justice told him that, under common law, a bayonet thrust was not an act of self-defense against a stone, which was not a lethal weapon. Had a soldier killed anyone, Molesworth could have been tried for his life.'&lt;ref&gt;John Murrin, Paul Johnson, James McPherson, Alice Fahs, Gary Gerstle, [https://books.google.com/books?id=5_Y2LhgrpToC&amp;pg=PA183 : ''Liberty, Equality, Power: A History of the American People,''] Cengage Learning, 2011 p.183&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Political demonstrations in many countries have resulted with the arrest of violent protestors for throwing rocks and other objects at police.&lt;ref name=DW&gt;{{cite news|title=Paris police arrest scores as pro-Palestinian demo turns violent|url=http://www.dw.de/paris-police-arrest-scores-as-pro-palestinian-demo-turns-violent/a-17811025|accessdate=13 April 2015|agency=AFP, dpa, Reuters|publisher=DW|date=27 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Malm&gt;{{cite news|last1=Malm|first1=Sarah|title=Terror in Turkey: At least nine dead as demonstrators take to the streets across the country over their government's lack of action against ISIS|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2784078/Tensions-rise-Turkey-ISIS-doorstep-demonstrators-protest-against-government-s-lack-action-against-ISIS-attack-Kobane.html|accessdate=13 April 2015|publisher=Daily Mail|date=8 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gezi&gt;{{cite news|title=Riot police target Turkish protesters in Istanbul and Ankara on anniversary of Gezi Park|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/world/riot-police-target-turkish-protesters-article-1.1812662|accessdate=13 April 2015|agency=AP|publisher=Daily News|date=31 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Madrid&gt;{{cite news|title=Huge anti-austerity protest in Madrid turns violent Reports suggest 50 police officers injured during rioting|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/europe/huge-anti-austerity-protest-in-madrid-turns-violent-1.1735211|accessdate=13 April 2015|agency=Reuters|publisher=Irish Times|date=23 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rock throwing during riots is a criminal offense, for which rock throwers can be charged with felony crimes, including assault on a law enforcement officer.&lt;ref name=Hindu&gt;{{cite news|title=Stone throwing: seven arrested|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/stone-throwing-seven-arrested/article6681184.ece|accessdate=12 April 2015|publisher=The Hindu|date=11 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bell&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bell|first1=Kim|title=St. Louis man charged with throwing brick at cop during Ferguson protes|url=http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/st-louis-man-charged-with-throwing-brick-at-cop-during/article_682aaa98-6d9e-5d77-bbff-65b7b58864fb.html|accessdate=12 April 2015|publisher=St. Louis Post-Dispatch|date=30 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bernstein&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bernstein|first1=Aaron|title=New protests near Ferguson after officer kills armed suspect|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/new-protests-near-ferguson-after-officer-kills-armed-suspect/|accessdate=12 April 2015|agency=Reuters|publisher=CBS|date=25 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Green&gt;{{cite news|last1=Green|first1=Sarah Jean|title=Arrested protesters accused of rioting, assault|url=http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/arrested-protesters-accused-of-rioting-assault/|accessdate=12 April 2015|publisher=Seattle Times|date=2 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Incidents of criminal rock throwing havye resulted in arrests during sports riots; especially notable are incidents of rock-throwing [[football hooliganism]].&lt;ref name=Olson&gt;{{cite news|last1=Olson|first1=Robin|title=RIOT CHARGES: Richfield man, 22, accused of throwing bottles, rocks|url=http://www.myfoxtwincities.com/story/25246081/riot-charges-filed-over-dinkytown-hockey-disturbance|accessdate=12 April 2015|publisher=Fox News|date=14 April 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20150412203314/http://www.myfoxtwincities.com/story/25246081/riot-charges-filed-over-dinkytown-hockey-disturbance|archivedate=12 April 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==At people==

Rock-throwing can be used by thieves, as demonstrated by a 2015 case in India in which Ratan Marwadi (45) was charged with throwing rocks at a random passer-by, Darshana Pawar, for the purpose of disabling and robbing her. Pawar was killed.

===Legal status===

In the 19th century, "stone throwing" was defined as a "nuisance", one of a number of offenses such as "kite-flying" and "doorbell ringing" to be handled by bylaws which differed from town to town.&lt;ref&gt;Steve Sturdy, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ITR_04uCbHkC&amp;pg=PA194 ''Medicine, Health and the Public Sphere in Britain, 1600-2000,''] Routledge 2013 p.194.&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, increasing numbers of undocumented sub-Saharan Africans have passed through Morocco attempting to reach European Union countries, many attempt to enter Spanish soil at two Spanish enclaves, [[Melilla]] and [[Ceuta]], located on the African side of the Mediterranean Sea.

Stone throwing rioters have repeatedly clashed with Egyptian troops at the [[Egypt-Gaza border]].
* In 2008, Gazans assaulted Egyptian border guards by throwing barrages of rocks over the low, concrete border wall topped with barbed wire, then tore down a section of the wall, opening a road and moving goods and people across for several hours before the Egyptian Army, avoiding the use of lethal force, managed to regain control of the border.&lt;ref name=Erlanger&gt;{{cite news|last1=Erlanger|first1=Steven|title=Egypt Tries to Plug Border; Gazans Poke New Hole|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/26/world/middleeast/26gaza.html|accessdate=14 April 2015|publisher=New York Times|date=26 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was first proposed from Prof. Dr. [[Elmar Sinz|Elmar J. Sinz]] in 1988. The SERM is commonly used in the [[SAP AG|SAP]]-world for the [[data modeling]].&lt;ref name="Röthlin2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael Röthlin|title=Management of Data Quality in Enterprise Resource Planning Systems|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wyheQllcyh0C&amp;pg=PA118|year=2010|publisher=BoD – Books on Demand|isbn=978-3-89936-963-2|pages=118–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Customer and article are independent entities
* Every order is referred to one customer. Orders without customers are illegal (order is an ER type). Customers without any orders are legal because they are independent Entities. 
* To every order there is belonging at least one order item. 
* Every order item is related to exactly one order. 
* Every invoice is referred to one customer, as well. Invoices without customers are illegal. Customers without any invoice are legal.
* To every invoice there is belonging at least one invoice line item.
* Every invoice line item is related to exactly order item. An order item could be calculated or not.
* SERM is already in the [[third normal form]]

'''Taiwanese units of measurement''' ({{zh|t=臺制|p=Táizhì|poj=Tâi-chè}}) are the customary and traditional [[Units of measurement|units of measure]] used in [[Taiwan]].  Many of the units derive from [[Japanese units of measurement]] and have similar names as [[Chinese units of measurement]] but different conversions than in [[mainland China]] or [[Hong Kong]].  In some cases these units are used exclusively, in some cases alongside official [[International System of Units|metric (SI)]] units, and in other cases they have been supplanted by metric units.  [[Linguistics|Linguistically]], practically all Taiwanese units of measure are [[Chinese classifier]]s used to [[classifier (linguistics)|classify]] [[nouns]].

==Length==
Linear measure in Taiwan is largely metric but some units derived from traditional Japanese units of measurement remain in use as a legacy of [[Taiwan under Japanese rule|Japanese rule]].

{|  class="wikitable"
! Unit || Definition || Basis
|-
| 1 Taiwanese inch ({{zh|c={{linktext|寸}}|p=cùn|poj=chhùn|labels=no}}) || 3.030{{nbsp}}cm || Japanese ''[[Cun (unit)|sun]]''
|-
| 1 Taiwanese foot ({{zh|c={{linktext|尺}}|p=chǐ|poj=chhioh|labels=no}}) || 30.30{{nbsp}}cm || Japanese ''[[Shaku (unit)|shaku]]''
|}

==Area==
[[File:10-Phêng Apartment.JPG|thumb|200px|An advertisement from [[IKEA]] for a 10-''ping'' apartment]]

Unlike with other measures, area continues to be almost commonly measured with traditional units. The principal unit for measuring the floorspace of an office or apartment, the ''ping'' ({{zh|c={{linktext|坪}}|p=píng|poj=pêⁿ / pîⁿ / phêⁿ / phîⁿ / phiâⁿ / phêng|labels=no}}) derives from the Japanese ''[[Japanese units of measurement#Area|tsubo]]'', the base unit of the Japanese area. Taiwanese units of [[land measurement]] derive from both traditional [[Dutch units of measurement|Dutch]] and Japanese measurements.  The principal unit of land measure, the ''jia'' ({{zh|c={{linktext|甲}}|p=jiǎ|poj=kah|labels=no}}), derives from the obsolete Dutch ''[[morgen]]'', which was introduced during Taiwan's [[Dutch Formosa|Dutch era]]. The ''li'' ({{zh|c={{linktext|犁}}|p=lí|poj=lê|labels=no}}) represented the area that could be farmed by one man with one ox and one plow in one day.

*1&amp;nbsp;''ping'' = 36&amp;nbsp;square ''chi'' = {{convert|3.306|m2|ft2|abbr=on}}
*1&amp;nbsp;''mu'' ({{zh|c={{linktext|畝}}|p=mǔ|poj=bó͘|labels=no}}) = 30&amp;nbsp;''ping'' = {{convert|99.2|m2|ft2|abbr=on}}
*1&amp;nbsp;''jia'' = 2,934&amp;nbsp;''ping'' = {{convert|0.9699|hectare|acre}}{{sfnp|MOE|2011|loc=#1857}}
*1&amp;nbsp;''li'' = 5&amp;nbsp;''jia''  = {{convert|4.8496|hectare|acre}}

Officially, land area is measured in [[hectare]]s and [[square kilometer]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|script-title=zh:《中華民國統計資訊網》縣市重要統計指標查詢系統網|url=http://statdb.dgbas.gov.tw/pxweb/Dialog/statfile9.asp|accessdate=25 July 2016|language=zh}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Volume==
Volume measure in Taiwan is largely metric, with common units such as liter and milliliter.

{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}

==Mass==
[[Image:Sam-ho-chhi.jpg|thumb|Fruit sold in [[catty|catties]] in a Taiwanese market]]
Packaged goods in Taiwan largely use metric measurements but bulk foodstuffs sold in [[wet market]]s and [[supermarket]]s are typically measured with units derived from traditional [[Japanese_units_of_measurement#Mass|Japanese units of mass]], which are similar but not equivalent to corresponding [[Chinese_units_of_measurement#Mass|Chinese units of mass]]. 

*1&amp;nbsp;[[Cash (unit)|cash]] ({{zh|c=釐|p=lí|poj=lî|labels=no}}) = 37.5&amp;nbsp;[[milligram|mg]]
*1&amp;nbsp;[[candareen]] ({{zh|c=分|p=fēn|poj=hun|labels=no}}) = 10&amp;nbsp;cash = 375&amp;nbsp;mg
*1&amp;nbsp;[[Mace (measurement)|mace]] ({{zh|c=錢|p=qián|poj=chîⁿ|labels=no}}) = 10&amp;nbsp;candareens = 3.75&amp;nbsp;[[gram|g]]
*1&amp;nbsp;[[tael#Taiwan|tael]] ({{zh|c=兩|p=liǎng|poj=niú|labels=no}}) = 10&amp;nbsp;mace = 37.5&amp;nbsp;g
*1&amp;nbsp;[[catty]] ({{zh|c=斤|p=jīn|poj=kin/kun|labels=no}}) = 16&amp;nbsp;taels = 0.6&amp;nbsp;[[kilogram|kg]]
*1&amp;nbsp;[[picul]] ({{zh|c=擔|p=dān|poj=tàⁿ|labels=no}}) = 100&amp;nbsp;catties = 60&amp;nbsp;kg
Note the tael and catty are widely used.

==History==
The Taos Institute was founded in 1991 by a group of scholars and practitioners interested in [[social constructionism|social constructionist]] ideas. The founders included [[Harlene Anderson]], [[David Cooperrider]], [[Kenneth Gergen]], [[Mary Gergen]], [[Sheila McNamee]], [[Suresh Srivastva]], and [[Diana Whitney]]. Primary attention was focused at that time on [[organizational development]] and [[family therapy]], with practices of [[appreciative inquiry]] and co-constructive practices of therapy prevailing. Most of the founders remain on the executive board, but have since been joined by Dawn Dole, Robert Cottor, Sally St. George, Jane Magruder Watkins, and Dan Wulff. The institute currently functions as a virtual centered organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=The Taos Institute|title=Institute Officers and Board of Directors|url=http://www.taosinstitute.net/institute-officers-and-board-of-directors|website=The Taos Institute|accessdate=5 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name of the Institute was derived, in part, from the fact that one of its founders, Diana Whitney, lived in [[Taos, New Mexico]], and provided a geographic center for possible meetings. In 1993, the Institute held its first international conference in Taos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=The Taos Institute|title=Brief History|url=http://www.taosinstitute.net/brief-history|website=The Taos Insititute|accessdate=5 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Copernican Revolution''''' is a 1957 book by the philosopher [[Thomas Kuhn]], in which the author provides an analysis of the [[Copernican Revolution]], documenting the pre-Ptolemaic understanding through the [[Ptolemaic system]] and its variants until the eventual acceptance of the [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion|Keplerian system]].&lt;ref name=Kuhn&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt;

Kuhn argues that the Ptolemaic system provided broader appeal than a simple astronomical system but also became intertwined in broader philosophical and theological beliefs. Kuhn argues that this broader appeal made it more difficult for other systems to be proposed.&lt;ref name=butter&gt;

==Summation==
Kuhn summarized at the end of ''The Copernican Revolution'', citing the permanent achievements of Copernicus and Newton, while comparing the incommensurability of Newtonian physics with Aristotelian concepts that preceded the then new physics. Kuhn also noted that discoveries, such as that produced by Newton, were not in agreement with the prevailing world view during his lifetime.&lt;ref name=westman/&gt;

'''''The Power of Half: One Family's Decision to Stop Taking and Start Giving Back''''' is a book written by Kevin Salwen and his teenage daughter Hannah in 2010.&lt;ref name="worldcat1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimes1"&gt;{{cite news|last=Taylor|first=Ihsan|title=Paperback Row|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/16/books/review/PaperRow-t.html|accessdate=March 9, 2011|newspaper=The New York Times|date=January 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bloomberg1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Rosboch |first=Lili |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-06-21/family-sells-2-million-mansion-gives-half-to-charity-review.html |title=Family Sells $2M Mansion, Gives Half to Charity: Review |publisher=Bloomberg |date=June 21, 2010 |author= |accessdate=March 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book describes how the Salwen family decided to sell their home so that they could donate half the proceeds to charity.&lt;ref name="oprah1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.oprah.com/world/Hannah-and-Kevin-Salwens-New-Book-The-Power-of-Half |title= A Surprising Path to Philanthropy |work=O, The Oprah Magazine  |date=April 2010 |author=Rachel Mount |accessdate=March 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It discusses the initial decision-making, the process of selling the home, making the donation, downgrading to a smaller home, and what they learned in the process.&lt;ref name="oprah1"/&gt; The book details the Salwens' process in choosing a charity partner that would fit their values and effect a lasting change, and how their actions supporting and empowering a village in Ghana differed from their original idea of "direct involvement".&lt;ref name=worldcat1 /&gt;

==Synopsis==
The book details why and how the Salwen family decided to sell their home in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/news-by-industry/et-cetera/What-could-you-live-without/articleshow/5498358.cms |title=What Could You Live Without? |work=The Economic Times |date=January 25, 2010 |author= |accessdate=March 9, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100127015718/http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/News/News-By-Industry/ET-Cetera/What-could-you-live-without/articleshow/5498358.cms |archivedate=January 27, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The home was a luxurious, 6,500-square-foot (600-square-meter), 1912 historic dream-house in [[Ansley Park]], in  [[Midtown Atlanta|midtown]] [[Atlanta, Georgia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://moneywatch.bnet.com/saving-money/blog/ask-agent/atlanta-family-sells-house-donates-half-proceeds-to-charity/1496/ |title=Atlanta Family Sells House, Donates Half Proceeds to Charity |publisher=CBS MoneyWatch |date=February 15, 2010 |author=Allison Rogers |accessdate=March 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It had [[Corinthian column]]s, five bedrooms, eight fireplaces, four ornate bathrooms, and a private elevator to Hannah's bedroom.&lt;ref name="bloomberg1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="greenbuildingelements1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://greenbuildingelements.com/2010/10/04/could-you-give-up-half-your-house/ |title=Could You Give Up Half Your House? |work=Green Building Elements |date=October 4, 2010 |author=Dawn Killough |accessdate=March 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="heraldtribune1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.heraldtribune.com/article/20100710/ZNYT01/7103010/-1/sports?p=all&amp;tc=pgall |title=‘Daddy, Are We Rich?’ and Other Tough Questions |work=Herald Tribune |author=Ron Lieber |date=July 10, 2010 |accessdate=March 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="azcentral1"&gt;{{cite news|last=Bland |first=Karina |url=http://www.azcentral.com/arizonarepublic/arizonaliving/articles/2010/03/21/20100321bland0321.html |title=Family lives on half the lifestyle, twice the joy |work=The Arizona Republic |date=March 21, 2010 |accessdate=March 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="timesonline1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://women.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/women/families/article7060900.ece |title= Daddy, I want to help the poor–let’s sell the house; A daughter’s plea led one family to make a big gesture, but not everyone is applauding |work=The Sunday Times |date=March 14, 2010|author= John-Paul Flintoff |accessdate=March 9, 2011 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The family down-graded by replacing their home with a house that was half as expensive and less than half the size.&lt;ref name="heraldtribune1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://abcnews.go.com/WN/family-sells-15-million-home-half-price-village/story?id=9780698&amp;page=1 |title=Family Sells $1.5 Million Home For One That's Half the Price to Help Village in Ghana |publisher=ABC News |date=February 8, 2010 |author= |accessdate=March 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Salwens donated half the proceeds ($850,000) of the sale of their original home to [[The Hunger Project]], a charity that works to lessen the hunger of 30,000 rural villagers in over 30 villages in Ghana, and helps them gain self-reliance.&lt;ref name="bloomberg1"/&gt;

The book describes the consensus-driven process that the parents and their two children used–over a period of time–to reach the decision to give away half the value of their home, and how they chose the charity from a number of [[non-profit organization]]s that they considered.&lt;ref name="bloomberg1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="azcentral1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cantonrep1"/&gt;  It describes the challenges that the family faced while turning their family project into a reality, from economic ones to keeping the project a secret for a period of time so that they would not appear to be "freaks" to their friends.&lt;ref name="bloomberg1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="newyorker1"&gt;{{cite journal|author= [[Larissa MacFarquhar]] |url=http://www.newyorker.com/talk/2010/03/15/100315ta_talk_macfarquhar |title=A family makes a big donation to a village in Ghana |work=The New Yorker |date=January 7, 2009 |accessdate=March 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before they embarked on the project, the family members had little contact with one another, other than at meals.&lt;ref name="bloomberg1"/&gt;  Hannah notes that ''The Power of Half''  "is a relationships book, not really a giving book."  She feels that the project helped her family grow closer to one another.&lt;ref name="naturalhomemagazine1"&gt;{{cite news|last=Kellner |first=Jessica |url=http://www.naturalhomemagazine.com/green-professionals/the-power-of-half-natural-home-interviews-hannah-salwen.aspx |title=The Power of Half: Natural Home Interviews Hannah Salwen |work=Natural Home Magazine |date=September–October 2010  |accessdate=March 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The New York Times Book Review]]'' notes how the family "became happier with less—and urges others to do likewise."&lt;ref name="nytimes1"/&gt;

"We know that selling a house is goofy, and we recognize that most people can't do it", admitted Kevin Salwen.&lt;ref name="azcentral1"/&gt; "We never encourage anybody to sell their house. That was just the thing that we had more than enough of. For others it may be time, or lattes, or iTunes downloads, or clothes in their closet. But everyone has more than enough of something.”&lt;ref name="heraldtribune1"/&gt;  He clarified:

&lt;blockquote&gt;We want our kids to be idealistic, but we also say, ‘Let’s not go too nuts here'.  We’re not Mother Teresa. We’re not taking a vow of poverty, or giving away half of everything we own. We gave away half of one thing, which happened to be our house. Everybody can give away half of one thing, and put it to use. You’ll do a little bit of good for the world–and amazing things for your relationships.&lt;ref name="azcentral1"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Popular reception==
[[Archbishop Desmond Tutu]] praised Hannah and the Salwens for the project, remarking: “We often say that young people must not let themselves be infected by the cynicism of their elders. Hannah inoculated her family with the vision to dream a different world, and the courage to help create it.”&lt;ref name="greenbuildingelements1"/&gt;

Skeptics criticized them for "self-promotion" or for the amount of money they donated to charity. Some critics questioned their choice of charity—finding fault with the family for having donated their money to help needy people in Africa rather than in the United States.&lt;ref name="newyorker1"/&gt;&lt;ref name=cour&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/lifestyle/family/articles/2010/07/31/are_they_courageous_or_reckless/?page=full |title=Are they courageous or reckless? |work=The Boston Globe |author=Joseph P.

Commented one viewer of a television interview: “What kind of ass clown works his tail off, and busts his hump getting a decent education, only to listen to his kid suggest they give away the house?”&lt;ref name="newyorker1"/&gt;

As Kevin Salwen noted: "Most people are supportive. And a few are very uncomfortable."&lt;ref name="newyorker1"/&gt;  Asked facetiously whether Hannah, then still in high school, had "concocted the world's greatest college-admissions ploy", Kevin laughed and replied: "No.  Anyway, wouldn’t it be the world’s most expensive?"&lt;ref name="boston1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/ae/books/articles/2010/02/13/one_familys_commitment_to_helping_others/ |title=One family’s commitment to helping others |work=The Boston Globe |date=February 13, 2010 |author=Joseph P. Kahn |accessdate=March 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception==

Reviewing it for ''[[The Washington Post]]'', Lisa Bonos wrote that the book, "soaring in idealism, and yet grounded in realism, can show Americans of any means how best to give back."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/04/16/AR2010041602032.html |title=Book review: 'The Power of Half,' by Kevin Salwen and Hannah Salwen |work=The Washington Post|author=Lisa Bonos |date= April 18, 2010|accessdate=March 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nicholas D. Kristof]], writing in ''[[The New York Times]]'', said he found the project "crazy, impetuous, and utterly inspiring", and that "It’s a book that, frankly, I’d be nervous about leaving around where my own teenage kids might find it. An impressionable child reads this, and the next thing you know your whole family is out on the street."&lt;ref name=nyt2&gt;{{cite news|last=Kristof|first=Nicholas D.|title=What Could You Live Without?|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/24/opinion/24kristof.html|accessdate=March 9, 2011|newspaper=The New York Times|date=January 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', Susan Salter Reynolds wrote:  "You feel lighter reading this book, as if the heavy weight of house and car and appliances, the need to collect these things to feel safe as a family, are lifted and replaced by something that makes much more sense."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2010/jan/24/entertainment/la-ca-discoveries24-2010jan24 |title='The Power of Half' by Kevin and Hannah Salwen |publisher=Los Angeles Times |author=Susan Salter Reynolds |date=January 24, 2010 |accessdate=March 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lili Rosboch wrote for [[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]] that it "is an inspiring book about the decision to trade objects for togetherness and the chance to help others."&lt;ref name="bloomberg1"/&gt;  Writing in ''[[Grist (magazine)|Grist]]'', Jen Harper said that while she was somewhat skeptical before she started the book, the "compelling and well-written narrative left me both impressed and inspired," and that she found the book "endearing, funny, and uplifting".&lt;ref name="grist1"/&gt;  Courtney E. Martin wrote in ''[[The Daily Beast]]'' that the book "is highly accessible, sure to be devoured by Oprah devotees and disaffected finance guys hoping for a jolt of optimism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/2010-02-20/selling-the-housefor-charity/ |title=Selling Your House For Charity |work=The Daily Beast |date=February 20, 2010 |author= Courtney E. Martin|accessdate=March 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bill Williams of ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' called it "spirited".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/ae/books/articles/2010/02/15/the_power_of_half_is_full_of_inspiration/|title=‘The Power of Half’ is full of inspiration |publisher=The Boston Globe |author=Bill Williams |date=February 15, 2010 |accessdate=March 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also writing for ''The Boston Globe'', Joseph P. Kahn said "they’re my new role models" – after admitting: "I confess to being fixated on the opposite life formula. Call it the Power of Twice. As in, twice the leisure time, twice the income, twice the sleep. A man can dream, can’t he?"&lt;ref name="boston1"/&gt;

==Subsequent projects==
The project inspired others to commit to donating half their money, or half of a possession or income, to charity.&lt;ref name="timesonline1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="grist1"/&gt;  In an interview in ''[[Natural Home Magazine]]'', Hannah noted that “A number of my friends at Atlanta Girls School have started their own Half projects, including a couple who are donating half of their babysitting money to environmental causes. That’s pretty flattering."&lt;ref name="greenbuildingelements1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="naturalhomemagazine1"/&gt;

Rev. Tess Baumberger, the Minister at [[Unity Church]] of [[North Easton]], Massachusetts, read the book and announced that in December 2010 the Church would give away half of its Sunday collections to a local charity.&lt;ref name="cantonrep1"/&gt; Baumberger remarked: "What will we learn by practicing the power of half? What will this program teach our children and youth? I cannot wait to find out."&lt;ref name="cantonrep1"&gt;{{cite news|author=Rev. Tess Baumberger |url=http://www.cantonrep.com/life/religion/x1617321451/Rev-Tess-Baumberger-Thanks-and-giving-the-power-of-half |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708114825/http://www.cantonrep.com/life/religion/x1617321451/Rev-Tess-Baumberger-Thanks-and-giving-the-power-of-half |archivedate=July 8, 2011|title= Thanks and giving–The Power of Half |work=CantonRep.com |date=November 23, 2010 |accessdate=January 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2682">The '''three-term contingency''' (also known as the '''ABC contingency''') in [[operant conditioning]] describes the relationship between a behavior, its consequence, and the environmental context. The three-term contingency was first defined by [[B. F. Skinner]] in the early 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/191686|title=Science and human behavior|author=Skinner, B. F. (Burrhus Frederic)|date=1953|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=0029290406|location=New York,|oclc=191686}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is often used within [[Applied behavior analysis|ABA]] to alter the frequency of socially significant human behavior.  

== Components ==

=== Antecedent ===
The antecedent stimulus occurs first in the contingency and signals that reinforcement or punishment is available on the contingency of a specific behavior. A [[Discriminative stimulus|discriminative stimuli]], or S&lt;sup&gt;D&lt;/sup&gt;, directly affects the likelihood of a specific response occurring.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/51566296|title=Behavior analysis and learning|last=David.|first=Pierce, W.|date=2004|publisher=L. Erlbaum Associates|others=Cheney, Carl D.|isbn=9780805844894|edition=3rd|location=Mahwah, N.J.|oclc=51566296}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Behavior ===
The [[behavior]], also referred to as the response, is any observable and measurable action a living organism can do. In the three-term contingency, behavior is operant, meaning it changes the environment in some way.  

=== Consequence ===
[[File:Operant conditioning diagram rev.svg|thumb|Diagram of consequences in operant conditioning]]
The consequence to a behavior can be reinforcing or punishing. [[Reinforcement|Reinforcing]] consequences increase the likelihood of a behavior occurring in the future; it is further divided into positive and negative reinforcement. [[Punishment (psychology)|Punishing]] consequences decrease the likelihood of a behavior occurring in the future; like reinforcement, it is divided into positive and negative punishment.

The effectiveness and value of a consequence is determined by the [[Motivating operation|motivating operations]] the organism has. For example, deprivation of food can make food more effective as a consequence, and the satiation of hunger can make food less effective as a consequence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/74942760|title=Applied behavior analysis|last=O.|first=Cooper, John|date=2007|publisher=Pearson/Merrill-Prentice Hall|others=Heron, Timothy E., Heward, William L., 1949-|isbn=0131421131|edition=2nd|location=Upper Saddle River, N.J.|oclc=74942760}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5954">'''Tschandala''' (old German transcription of ''[[chandala]]'') is a term [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] borrowed from the [[Indian caste system]], where a Tschandala is a member of the lowest social class. Nietzsche's interpretation and use of the term relied on a flawed source but was used by some interpreters to connect him to [[Nazi ideology]].

== Nietzsche's use of the term ==
Nietzsche uses the term "Tschandala" in the  ''Götzen-Dämmerung'' (''Twilight of the Idols'')&lt;ref&gt;"Die ‚Verbesserer‘ der Menschheit" (KSA 6, p. 98–102)&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Der Antichrist'' (''The Antichrist'').&lt;ref&gt;chapter 56 and 57 (KSA 6, p. 239–244)&lt;/ref&gt; Here he uses the "[[law of Manu]]“ with its [[Caste system in India|caste system]] as an example of one kind of morality, of "breeding", as opposed to the Christian version of morality which attempts to "tame" man. 

At first, Nietzsche describes methods of [[Christianity|Christian]] attempts to "improve" humanity. As a metaphor, he uses a trained beast in a menagerie which is said to be "improved", but which in reality has lost vitality and is only weakened. In just such a way, Nietzsche says, has Christianity "tamed" the Teutonic races.

The law of Manu, on the other hand, tries to "improve" humanity by creating 4 castes of people, while ostracizing and making life miserable for the Tschandala, the untouchables. Nietzsche deplores this type of morality, that of the "breeder," just as he does the (Christian) "animal tamer", as he is opposed to all 'morality'. However, he much prefers it to the Christian "slave-morality." In his view, the humiliating and oppressive edicts against the Tschandala are a defensive means of keeping the castes pure:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Yet this organization too found it necessary to be ''terrible''—this time not in the struggle with beasts, but with their counter-concept, the unbred man, the mishmash man, the chandala. And again it had no other means for keeping him from being dangerous, for making him weak, than to make him ''sick''—it was the fight with the "great number.&lt;ref name="götzendämmerung"&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/7203 Götzen-Dämmerung], Die "Verbesserer" der Menschheit&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Nietzsche, Christianity is a product of [[Judaism]], the "Tschandala-religion". By this he means that Judaism and Christianity after it are the morality born of the hatred of the oppressed (like the Tschandala) for their oppressors:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Christianity, sprung from Jewish roots and comprehensible only as a growth on this soil, represents the ''counter-movement'' to any morality of breeding, of race, privilege:—it is the ''anti-Aryan'' religion par excellence. Christianity, the revaluation of all Aryan values, the victory of chandala values, the gospel preached to the poor and base, the general revolt of all the downtrodden, the wretched, the failures, the less favored, against "race": the undying chandala hatred as the ''religion of love''...&lt;ref name="götzendämmerung" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In ''[[The Antichrist (book)|The Antichrist]]'', Nietzsche again cites the law of Manu, and favors it in a relative sense to the morality of Judeo-Christianity. Nietzsche describes the "most spiritual" and "strongest" men who can say "yes" to everything, even the existence of the Tschandalas; and opposed to this is the envious and revengeful spirit of the Tschandalas themselves (cf. [[master-slave morality]]). Nietzsche also uses the term Tschandala for some of his opponents, e.g. [[socialism]].

== Nietzsche's flawed source ==
Nietzsche's source for the law of Manu was the book ''Les législateurs religieux. Manou, Moïse, Mahomet'' (1876) by French writer [[Louis Jacolliot]]. According to Annemarie Etter, this translation of the [[Manusmriti]] is not reliable and differs widely from other sources.&lt;ref&gt;Annemarie Etter: ''Nietzsche und das Gesetzbuch des Manu'' in: ''Nietzsche-Studien'' 16 (1987), p. 340–352&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the high respect it gives to women, which Nietzsche quotes in opposition to "Christian misogyny", is in fact not contained in any of the usual texts.

In his description and interpretation of the "Tschandala", Nietzsche may have followed a long footnote by Jacolliot, which gives an "unbelievable, abstruse and scientifically completely untenable" (Etter) theory. According to Jacolliot, all [[Semitic peoples]], especially the Hebrews, are descendants of emigrated Tschandalas. Although Nietzsche never directly says this, it seems plausible that he believed in Jacolliot's theory at least to some extent, even though, as Etter points out, Nietzsche would have easily been able to falsify several of Jacolliot's [[pseudo-science|pseudo-scientific]] claims. In so doing, he may have increased the impact of Jacolliot's "effusive admiration for ancient Eastern wisdom and civilization with a more or less open and pronounced antisemitism and antichristianism" (Etter).

==Descendant uses==

=== Nazi Germany===
&lt;!--missing: real use in NS. perhaps at Alfred Baeumler --&gt;

Terms like "race", "breeding", "[[Aryan]]" and others Nietzsche used in his later works were employed by Nazi polemicists who referenced his theories.

Though Nietzsche did use the term ''[[Übermensch]]'', ''nowhere'' in his works he used the contrary ''[[Untermensch]]'' that in the 20th Century became a concept in Nazi ideology, that was used for races and individuals that it perceived ''"inferior"''. 

=== Literary influence ===

Inspired by Nietzsche, [[August Strindberg]] wrote a novel called "Tschandala" in 1889.

{{Main|Women's liberation movement}}
The '''[[women's liberation movement]] in Asia''' was a [[Radical feminism|feminist]] movement that started in the late 1960s and through the 1970s. Women's liberation movements in [[Asia]] sought to  redefine women's relationships to the family and the way that women expressed their [[Human sexuality|sexuality]]. Women's liberation in Asia also dealt with particular challenges that made the liberation movement unique in different countries.

Several countries were influenced by [[Western world|Western]] women's liberation movements, and in the case of [[China]], ideas from the [[Cultural Revolution]] actually helped shape women's liberation in the West. Many Asian feminists had to straddle the line between being feminist or being "Asian." In [[India]], the [[Caste|caste system]] affected the way that women's liberation was approached in that gender and class could rarely be separated. Similarly in [[Israel]], the plight of [[Palestinians|Palestinian]] women became important in molding the views of oppression. In [[Japan]], the movement focused on sexuality rather than equality, in an attempt to gain recognition for women's autonomy and freedom to choose their own social roles. In [[Singapore]], [[South Korea]] and [[Taiwan]], the liberationist movement was inspired by the world-wide movement for women's liberation and typically combined the fight against sexism with the struggle against colonialism and economic exploitation. [[Turkey]] came to the women's liberation movement later than other countries and was influenced by feminists from other countries and also by [[Islam]]ic women. Turkey's struggle for women's liberation was centered around the issue of [[domestic violence]].

== China ==
Women's status in [[China]] during the twentieth century were tied closely to the [[Communist revolution|Communist Revolution]] there and women's social status rose quickly.{{sfn|Jones|1996|p=152}} Initially, Chinese people believed that the Communist Revolution would end [[patriarchy]].{{sfn|Li|2000|p=39}} During the [[Cultural Revolution]], women were celebrated through slogans like "Women Hold Up Half the Sky", while simultaneously they were discouraged from discussing gender issues, which was seen as "[[reactionary]]".{{sfn|Jones|1996|p=152}} In the 1970s, new institutions that benefited and were staffed by women were created, including cafeterias, [[kindergarten]]s, and nurseries.{{sfn|Li|2000|p=32}} Women's rights were managed by the state itself{{sfn|Hathaway|2018}} and there was no independent [[Feminism in China|feminist movement]] during the period.{{sfn|Zhou|2003|pp=71–74}} However, many of the ideas created during the revolution went on to influence women's movements in the [[Western world|West]], as radical feminists often were politically aligned on the left. In the polarized camps of the [[Cold War]] period, socialists turned from emulating [[USSR|Soviet]] communism in the wake of [[Stalinist purges]] and invasions. [[Feminist movement|Western feminists]] after 1960 based key ideals on [[Maoism|Maoist]] theory. Slogans such as "workers of the world unite" turned into "women of the world unite" and key features like [[consciousness-raising]] and [[Egalitarianism|egalitarian consensus-based policies]] "were inspired by similar techniques used in China".{{sfn|Hathaway|2018}}

== India ==
Politics in India became radicalized in the late 1960s with numerous special interests groups forming to address corruption and the economic crisis brought about by destructive development. By the 1970s, [[Famine in India#1972 Maharashtra drought|drought in the Maharashtra state]] worsened conditions for many. Peaking in 1974 with encouragement from the [[Navnirman Movement]], women in diverse classes began to engage in direct actions to challenge leadership.{{sfn|Patel|1985|pp=2–3}} The idea of "women's liberation" became a "respectable topic" in [[India]] starting in the 1970s.{{sfn|Omvedt|1975|p=40}} Women began to see that legal protections were doing very little to change the reality of their lives.{{sfn|Jones|1996|p=151}} [[Rural area|Rural]] women who lived in [[poverty]] began to see themselves as doubly disadvantaged: both economically and through their lower social status.{{sfn|Omvedt|1975|p=44}} Women in lower [[Caste system in India|castes]], such as [[Dalit]]s, realized that they had to fight a class battle, as well as a battle against sexism.{{sfn|Omvedt|1975|p=44}} However, most women participating in the women's liberation movement in the 1970s were [[middle class]] or part of the [[Forward caste|upper caste]], and were [[Urban area|urban]] and educated.{{sfn|Sowjanya|2011|p=52}}

The Women's Federation of [[Kerala]] had grown to 100,000 members by 1970 and the [[Ganatantrik Mahila Samiti]] (Democratic Women's Organization) held a state conference in April 1973 in [[West Bengal]] that drew 121,632 members from nearly every district.{{sfn|Omvedt|1975|p=41}} In 1974, organizations such as the Women's Anti-Price-Rise movement in [[Maharashtra]], the [[Progressive Organization of Women]] (POW) of [[Hyderabad]], and the [[Stree Mukti Sanghatana]] of [[Mumbai|Bombay]] formed, with women joining these leftist organizations in greater numbers.{{sfn|Patel|1985|p=3}}{{sfn|Omvedt|1975|p=41}} The first Democratic Women's Union conference was held in [[Tamil Nadu]] in December 1974.{{sfn|Omvedt|1975|p=40-41}} Student unrest and protest in [[Delhi]] sparked women to create their own human rights movement.{{sfn|Patel|1985|p=3}}

Creating small groups in such places as [[Banglore]], Bombay, Delhi, Hyderabad, [[Madras]], and [[Pune]], the women's groups that formed in the period were averse to authoritarian structure and utilized a collective approach to decision-making. To challenge patriarchal power in personal and political spheres, they published and reproduced articles from other countries on Women's Liberation developments throughout the world. These loosely affiliated groups networked by circulating their publications in English, as well as regional languages. In Maharashtra, differing from other areas, meetings crossed caste and class divides, including students, laborers, blue collar workers, and white collar employees.{{sfn|Patel|1985|p=7}} Focusing on direct action, women in these groups protested official policy in various ways. For example, an influential street performance ''Om Swaha'' enacted by ''Stree Mukti Sanghatana'' members became iconic, galvanizing women to work against [[dowry deaths]].{{sfn|Menon|2011|p=xix}}

Publication of the report ''Towards Equality'' in 1974 and 1975 as part of the [[United Nations Commission on the Status of Women|United Nations survey on the Status of Women]], revealed that women's participation in economic and political life had declined in post-Independent India.{{sfn|Menon|2011|pp=xx, 110–111}} Unlike the western counterparts of the WLM, [[sexuality]] was a [[taboo]] topic in the era, though [[sexual violence]] became a focus. As such, [[lesbian]]s were part of the movement, but sexual orientation was largely a private matter.{{sfn|Menon|2011|p=24}} In like manner, liberationists were characterized as disruptive to class-based activists who firmly believed that elimination of class differences would solve women's problems.{{sfn|Menon|2011|pp=93–94}} In 1981, a group ''[[Sachetana]]'' was formed by activists in Calcutta{{sfn|Ray|2002|p=95}} with the goal of raising the consciousness of its members and other women.{{sfn|Ray|2002|p=77}} Their initial public protest was production of a play, ''Meye Dile Shajiye'', written by member [[Malini Bhattacharya]] to protest selling brides.{{sfn|Ray|2002|p=95}} Unaffiliated with any political party, the group became a safe space for women of varying beliefs and political ties to openly express and discuss issues criticizing government policy and patriarchy.{{sfn|Ray|2002|pp=61, 101}}

After [[The Emergency (India)|The Emergency]] ended in 1977 in India, membership in the women's movement swelled, which predominantly consisted up to that time of the organized, disciplined, hierarchically-structured, party-affiliated groups or the leaderless, inclusive and chaotic, but autonomous groups loosely affiliated with the political left.{{sfn|Menon|2011|pp=176–177}} The [[Forum against Oppression of Women|1980 Forum Against Rape]], held in Bombay at Cama Hall, marked a point where activists realized that multi-dimensional struggle focusing on both legal reform and raising awareness was necessary to combat systemic issues{{sfn|Menon|2011|p=179}} and different factions of [[Feminism in India|feminists]] began to come together to solve issues.{{sfn|Menon|2011|p=201}}

==Israel==
The women's liberation movement in Israel was initiated in the early 1970s by two American immigrants at the [[University of Haifa]], [[Marcia Freedman]]{{sfn|Becker|2015}} and [[Marylin Safir]] who had both been involved in feminist activities in the United States. Seminars they held in [[Haifa]] on how women suffered from a male-dominated society quickly inspired radical activities in [[Tel-Aviv]] and [[Jerusalem]].{{sfn|Ram|2012|p=150}} The first liberationist group formed in 1972,{{sfn|Herzog|2009}} spawning formation of consciousnesses-raising groups which used direct actions as a means of addressing women's issues.{{sfn|Ram|2012|p=150}} [[Women's studies]] emerged which highlighted the historical contributions of Israeli women.{{sfn|Marteu|2012}} Freedman commented: "It really wasn't that difficult translating American feminism to Israel, with many of the same issues: the ability of women to work outside the house, abortion and issues of women controlling their bodies, although on Israel a very common response was that no women's movement was needed because Israeli women were already 'liberated'."{{sfn|Becker|2015}}{{sfn|Ram|2012|p=150}}

In 1972, the radical ''Nilahem'' movement (based on an acronym meaning Women for a Renewed Society) was formed, attracting interest throughout the country with stands against legal inequality and the suffering of the Palestinians.{{sfn|Becker|2015}} During the 1973 [[Yom Kippur War]], women found themselves excluded from the civilian administration, and both the military and war production efforts, being relegated to treating the wounded and supporting families. Though short in duration, the conflict brought into focus an awareness of the segregated roles of women and men in society.{{sfn|Herzog|2009}} That same year, Freedman became the first openly feminist member of the [[Knesset]], supporting the Civil Rights Movement.{{sfn|Ram|2012|p=151}} Jerusalem liberationists saw in the movement a way to fight against all oppression, including that of the poor and Palestinians. They led actions over poor wages, women working at night, and violence against women, as well as the right to control decisions over reproduction, as did activists in Haifa and Tel Aviv.{{sfn|Frankfort-Nachmias|Shadmi|2005|p=43}}

Women's centers sprang up in metropolitan areas and by 1975, translated anthologies of US and European texts were appearing regularly in Israel.{{sfn|Ram|2012|p=151}} Various feminist publications appeared in the mid-1970s including ''Women as Human Beings'' by [[Shulamit Aloni]]. The feminist periodical ''Nogah'' began publication in 1980.{{sfn|Becker|2015}} In 1976, WLM members, led by Freeman, made headlines when they invaded a gynecological conference at the [[Hilton Tel Aviv]] to protest the position on abortion and were evicted by police.{{sfn|Frankfort-Nachmias|Shadmi|2005|p=43}} In 1977, the first women's shelter in Israel was founded in Haifa and the first rape crisis center was opened in Tel Aviv. That same year, a feminist publishing group ''The Second Sex'' was created and the lesbian liberationist group ''Aleph'' was founded,{{sfn|Ram|2012|p=151}} which led to the hosting of the first lesbian feminist conference the following year in [[Beersheba]].{{sfn|Frankfort-Nachmias|Shadmi|2005|p=44}} By the end of the 1970s, the movement was fracturing in Israel and Aleph disbanded in 1980.{{sfn|Frankfort-Nachmias|Shadmi|2005|pp=43–44}}

== Japan ==
In [[Japan]], the woman's liberation movement was known as ''ũman ribu'', marking a new social and political direction for women in Japan.{{sfn|Shigematsu|2012|pp=ix, 3}} The name ''ũman ribu'' was itself a transliteration of English for "women's lib" and was meant to show "both the activists' solidarity with other women's liberation movements around the world and their specificity as a new Japanese women's movement".{{sfn|Shigematsu|2015|p=175}} ''Ūman ribu'' differed from Western women's liberation movements in that the goals were not about [[Women's rights|equal rights]], but more focused on women's roles in Japan and "called for liberation from their sex," which is known as ''sei no kaihō''.{{sfn|Shigematsu|2015|p=174}}{{sfn|Ito|2015}}

Women in the movement felt that dealing with [[sexual desire]] (''seiyoku'') was important and defining for the movement itself.{{sfn|Shigematsu|2012|p=11}} Women such as Iwatsuki Sumie (also known as Asatori Sumie), wrote about [[Menstrual taboo|menstruation taboos]].{{sfn|Shigematsu|2012|p=57}} She was also instrumental in creating women's spaces and was known for her advocacy of [[lesbian]] relationships.{{sfn|Shigematsu|2015|p=178}} Activist, [[Yonezu Tomoko]], started ''Thought Group SEX'', which also explored [[disability]] and sexual liberation.{{sfn|Shigematsu|2012|p=66}} Sexual liberation for Tomoko and Tanaka didn't mean "free sex" (''furii sekkusu''), but instead focused on a liberation of women's sexuality.{{sfn|Shigematsu|2015|p=176}} In addition, the sense of autonomy over their own bodies meant that ''ũman ribu'' activist opposed efforts to restrict [[abortion]] and which emphasized creating a society where women "want to give birth".{{sfn|Shigematsu|2015|p=180}}

Women in Japan were considered "second-class citizens in society in general, within social movements [...], and in the family".{{sfn|Yamaguchi|2006|p=3}} Women involved in the movement were critical both of the literal modern family system and also of political movement that attempted to frame women's roles in politics in familial terminology.{{sfn|Shigematsu|2012|p=3}} Within the movement, Japanese women also attempted to rehabilitate the word, ''onna,'' for woman, which had become a derogatory way to refer to women, but one that did not have familial connotations.{{sfn|Shigematsu|2012|p=4}} Women involved in this women's liberation movement felt that they were different from people who were [[Feminism in Japan|''feminisuto'']] (feminist) which they felt only applied to academics involved in [[women's studies]].{{sfn|Lunsing|2016|p=260}} Many of the women involved in the ''ũman ribu'' movement were young and had been involved in [[New Left in Japan|New Left]] groups in the 1960s.{{sfn|Molony|2018}}

Groups began to appear in cities throughout Japan in April 1970.{{sfn|Shigematsu|2015|p=175}} These groups were not hierarchical and had no central leadership.{{sfn|Shigematsu|2015|p=175}} Starting in late 1970, an organization called ''Gurũpu tatakau onna'' (Group of Fighting Women) began to work towards women's liberation throughout Japan.{{sfn|Lenz|2014|p=217}}  Women met to discuss [[Mitsu Tanaka|Tanaka Mitsu's]] work, ''Liberation from the Toilet'' and also to advocate for a change in laws.{{sfn|Lenz|2014|p=217}} Tanaka chose to use the word "toilet" because women could be described as "little more than repositories of men's bodily fluids," or metaphorically speaking, as a convenience to men.{{sfn|Ito|2015}} Another ''ũman ribu'' publication was ''Onna erosu'', which started in the 1970s and had a diverse perspective on social movements.{{sfn|Muta|2000|pp=132–133}} The ''ũman ribu'' anthology for women in Japan came out in 1972 and was called ''Onna's Thought''.{{sfn|Shigematsu|2012|p=60}} The first public rally for ''ũman ribu'' took place on [[International Anti-War Day]], October 21, 1970.{{sfn|Shigematsu|2015|p=175}} In 1973, [[Tokyo]] activists created a public demonstration against [[Mother's Day]].{{sfn|Shigematsu|2015|p=178-179}} The activists had a banner that read "Mother's Day, what a laugh!" and critiqued the value of mothers, wives and children in Japanese society.{{sfn|Shigematsu|2015|p=179}}

Communes were started by ''ũman ribu'' activists in the early 1970s throughout Japan, including the best-known commune of [[Ribu Shinjuku Centre]] in Tokyo.{{sfn|Shigematsu|2015|p=179}} Various groups, including the ''Gurũpu tatakau onna,'' Thought Group SEX, Tokyo Komu-unu, Alliance of Fighting Women and Scarlet Letter helped establish the Ribu Shinjuku Centre.{{sfn|Shigematsu|2015|p=179}} The Centre was not only a central location for organizing and communicating, but also served as [[women's shelter]].{{sfn|Shigematsu|2015|p=179}} The women's liberation movement in Japan continued past the 1970s, but not with using the same terminology and methods.{{sfn|Lunsing|2016|p=292}}

== Singapore ==
[[Nalla Tan]] called for a council of women to be formed to advocate for women's rights in Singapore in 1972.{{sfn|Women's Action|n.d.}} The women's liberation movement in Singapore was energized in 1975, during the observance of the [[International Women's Year]].{{sfn|Lyons|2014}} That same year the [[Singapore Council of Women's Organisations|National Council of Women]] (NCW) was formed in order to coordinate the activities of women's groups in the country and to help end discrimination against women.{{sfn|Lyons|2014}} In 1983, the "[[Population planning in Singapore|Great Marriage Debate]]" began a conversation about [[eugenics]], motherhood and the need for [[feminism]] in Singapore.{{sfn|Lyons|2014}} Young people were encouraged to marry and have children by the government which was worried about the falling [[Total fertility rate|fertility rate]] in the country.{{sfn|Women's Action|n.d.}} The [[National University of Singapore]] Society held a forum in November 1984 that responded to the issues raised in the "Great Marriage Debate."{{sfn|Women's Action|n.d.}} [[Zaibun Siraj]] and [[Vivienne Wee]] organized the forum called "Women's Choices, Women's Lives" and brought speakers such as [[Kanwaljit Soin]], [[Hedwig Anuar]] and [[Margaret Thomas (editor)|Margaret Thomas]].{{sfn|Women's Action|n.d.}}

The first feminist organization in Singapore, the [[Association of Women for Action and Research]] (AWARE) was created in 1985 in response to the issues raised at the "Women's Choices, Women's Lives" forum.{{sfn|Women's Action|n.d.}}{{sfn|Lyons|2014}}{{sfn|Lyons|2000|p=3}} Members of AWARE were concerned about not being associated with negative [[stereotype]]s of feminism and balanced their feminism with "Asian values."{{sfn|Lyons|2000|p=7-8}} AWARE publicly focused on issues they called "women's rights" and "[[gender inequality]]".{{sfn|Lyons|2000|p=11}} They did not explicitly or publicly blame women's roles in society on men, but rather as "product of history and tradition," and that gender inequality affected both men and women in society.{{sfn|Lyons|2000|p=12}} Privately and in unpublished reports, members thought of themselves as feminists.{{sfn|Lyons|2000|p=13}}

== South Korea ==
The first women's organizations in South Korea arose from worker's struggles under the dictatorship of [[Park Chung-hee]] and were focused on poor working conditions and exploitation of women in the family under a system which required women to work to pay for their brothers' educations and support their families.{{sfn|Ching|Louie|2000|p=122}} In 1975, [[Yi Hyo-jae]] ({{lang-ko|李効再}}), a professor at [[Ewha Womans University]] (EWU) began to criticize existing women's organizations in Korea as being too focused on legal change for women rather than liberation of women from societal ideas of what women should be. As western literature, like ''[[The Second Sex]]'' by [[Simone de Beauvoir]] and then ''[[The Feminine Mystique]]'' by [[Betty Friedan]] and ''[[Sexual Politics]]'' by [[Kate Millett]] were translated into Korean in 1973, followed by ''[[Woman's Estate]]'' by [[Juliet Mitchell]], Korean intellectuals had become aware of the ideas of [[radical feminists]].{{sfn|Kim|2000|pp=220–221}} By 1977, a [[women's studies]] department was established at EWU.{{sfn|Jung|2014|p=23}} The development of the course utilized students' input and also requested material relating to the courses from 150 universities in the United States with women's studies classes.{{sfn|Jung|2014|p=23}} The women's studies department was criticized for relying too heavily on Western ideas, but there was a "strong interest" from students in the classes.{{sfn|Jung|2014|p=24}} The [[Feminism in South Korea|feminist movement]], known as Minjung feminism, which developed in South Korea in the 1980s merged worker concerns with liberationist ideas within the broader fight against dictatorship.{{sfn|Ching|Louie|2000|pp=123–125}}

== Taiwan ==
One of [[Taiwan|Taiwan's]] feminists, [[Annette Lu|Hsiu-lien Annette Lu]], was inspired by the [[Women's liberation movement in North America|women's liberation movement]] in the [[United States]].{{sfn|Chang|2009a|p=93}} In 1974, Lu published ''New Feminism'' which advocated for women to come together to end "the dominant patriarchal paradigm".{{sfn|Lu|2009|p=48}} Yang Mei-hui translated [[Margaret Mead|Margaret Mead's]] ''Sex and Temperament in Three Primitive Societies'' (1935), which introduced the concept of [[gender role]] formation to Chinese-speaking women in Taiwan.{{sfn|Chang|2009|p=51}} This translation was also an influence on Lu,{{sfn|Chang|2009|p=52}} whose followers established the [[Awakening Foundation]] and began publishing the ''Awakening Magazine'' in 1982.{{sfn|Chiang|Liu|2011|p=559}} Lu also wove [[Confucianism|Confucian philosophy]] into her feminist discourse to promote a cultural basis for addressing double-standards for men and women. By utilizing maxims such as "Do not impose on others what you yourself do not desire", she developed the theme of mutual respect for women.{{sfn|Chang|2009a|p=94}}

Student movements focusing on [[anti-imperialism]] began to appear in [[Turkey]] in the 1960s and leftist movements began to form in the 1970s.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://struggle.ws/turkey/may5/feminism_may00.html|title=Feminism in Turkey|last=Ege|first=Mine|date=May 2000|website=Struggle|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160807152711/http://struggle.ws/turkey/may5/feminism_may00.html|archive-date=7 August 2016|dead-url=|access-date=2018-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, women's concerns were not dealt with by many of these groups and women were actively discouraged from discussing them.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The [[women's liberation movement]] really began to flourish in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://middleeastreviewsonline.com/membr_review/women-and-civil-society-in-turkey-womens-movements-in-a-muslim-society/|title=Women and Civil Society in Turkey: Women's Movements in a Muslim Society - Review|last=Gokcek|first=Mustafa|date=2017|work=Middle East Media and Book Reviews|access-date=2018-05-31|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women who had been involved in these leftist groups started to talk about feminism and created consciousness-raising groups where they shared their own experiences as women with one another.{{sfn|Ergun|2017|p=43}} Many of the early feminists in Turkey were educated, often professional, middle class and who had links to feminists in other countries.{{sfn|Arat|1998|p=119}} Because of women's very marginalized position in Turkey, the movement went unnoticed until "a substantial, organized feminist movement grew out of these small groups."{{sfn|Ergun|2017|p=43}} One of the significant groups was called ''Kadin Çevresi'' (Women's Circle).{{sfn|Ergun|2017|p=43}} ''Kadin Çevresi'' translated and published books by significant feminist writers.{{sfn|Ergun|2017|p=44}} Translations were also published on the feminist page of ''Somut'', a weekly magazine, which began in 1983.{{sfn|Ergun|2017|p=44}}&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=4Uyypm6T7ZsC&amp;lpg=PA790&amp;dq=somut%20periodical&amp;pg=PA790#v=onepage&amp;q=somut%20periodical&amp;f=false|title=Encyclopedia of Women and Islamic Cultures: Family, Law and Politics|last=Çaha|first=Ōmer|publisher=Brill|year=2005|isbn=978-9004128187|editor-last=Joseph|editor-first=Suad|location=Leiden|pages=790–791|language=en|chapter=Turkey}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the books become translated, women would form book clubs and hold book discussions.{{sfn|Ergun|2017|p=44}} In addition to translating, women were also bringing new words into the Turkish language to describe issues they dealt with, such as "male domination" (''erkek egemenliği''), creating a feminist language that could help the movement grow.{{sfn|Ergun|2017|p=45}} Women in the movement criticized the [[Kemalism|Kemalist]] model of modernity in Turkey and focused on how women are forced to play roles within this modern world.{{sfn|Arat|1997|p=104}} [[Muslim]] women were also involved in the movement, encouraging women of the [[Islam]] faith to speak out about their experiences.{{sfn|Arat|1998|p=124-125}} Secular feminists and Islamic women in Turkey had an influence on each other during this time.{{sfn|Arat|1998|p=128}} Some, like {{Interlanguage link|Sibel Eraslan|tr|Sibel Eraslan|WD=}} described herself as "a feminist with faith."{{sfn|Arat|1998|p=128}} Secular feminists who were involved in the journal, ''Pazartesi'', were supportive of Muslim women "who wanted to redefine their identities as women."{{sfn|Arat|1998|p=128}}

By the mid 1980s, women were holding WLM protests in [[Istanbul]] and [[Ankara]].{{sfn|Arat|1998|p=119}} These feminists were united around the issue of [[domestic violence]] instead of [[abortion]], since abortion was already legal in Turkey.{{sfn|Arat|1998|p=119}} Activists kept track of court proceedings that "gave explicit legitimacy to domestic violence" and protested either by sending letters to the judge or by setting up rallies.{{sfn|Arat|1998|p=120}} There was "enthusiastic turnout" for a protest organized in May 1987 against domestic violence and the government's lack of action towards the issue.{{sfn|Arat|1998|p=120}} A following event, a "1 day festival in October of the same year" helped boost women's confidence in their actions.{{sfn|Arat|1998|p=120}}

The women's movement of the 1980s allowed feminist policies and groups to continue to grow in the 1990s and 2000s.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The [[Women's Library and Information Centre Foundation|Women's Library and Information Center]] and the Purple Roof Women's Shelter Foundation were both founded in 1990.{{sfn|Arat|1997|p=106}} Purple Roof worked hard to maintain autonomous control and rejected attempts of the state to "subvert the feminist meaning of their endeavor."{{sfn|Arat|1998|p=120}} One of the major contributors and founders of Purple Roof is [[Canan Arin]].{{sfn|Arat|1998|p=122}}

A woman human rights defender can be an Indigenous woman fighting for the rights of her community, a woman advocating against torture, an [[Intersex and LGBT|LGBTQI]] rights campaigner, a sex workers’ rights collective, or a man fighting for sexual and reproductive rights.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Like other [[human rights defenders]], women human rights defenders can be the target of attacks as they demand the realization of human rights. They face attacks such as discrimination, assault, threats, and violence within their communities.  However, women human rights defenders face additional obstacles based on who they are and the specific rights they defend. This means they are targeted just because they are women, LGBTI people or for identifying with their struggles. They also face additional obstacles connected with systemic discrimination and inequality and because they challenge, or are seen to be challenging, patriarchal power and social norms. They are more at risk of facing gender based violence in the home and the community, and sexist, misogynistic, homophobic, trans-phobic threats, smears and stigmatization, as well as exclusion from resources and power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/act30/6011/2017/en/|title=Document|website=www.amnesty.org|language=en|access-date=2018-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=20936&amp;LangID=E|title=OHCHR {{!}} International Women Human Rights Defenders Day –29 November 2016|website=www.ohchr.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The women that work to fight for human rights have numerous meetings with the UN Human Rights Council in conjunction with the LGBTQI defenders in Uganda who face prejudice and discrimination as well for The Women Human Rights Defenders understand the struggles being endured.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.defendingwomen-defendingrights.org/our-work/|title=Our Work {{!}}|website=www.defendingwomen-defendingrights.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Workers''' ({{zh|t=工人|s=工人|p=gongren}}) is a book of 143 portraits of migrant workers who participated in the construction of the [[Olympic Green]] in [[Beijing]], [[China]] in the lead up to the [[2008 Summer Olympics]].  The book is the work of British artist Helen Couchman and consists primarily of photographs of the workers on the building site. The workers were photographed with the iconic buildings of the Beijing Olympics: The [[Beijing National Stadium]] (国家体育场), known colloquially as the "Bird's Nest" (鸟巢), and the [[Beijing National Aquatics Center]] (国家游泳中心), also known as the "Water Cube" (水立方).

[[File:Jhang Gao pages 22-23.jpg|thumb|left|300px|&lt;center&gt;Portrait of Zhang Gao and his signature from the series ''Workers 工人''&lt;/center&gt;]]

== Background ==
At the height of its construction, nearly 17,000 workers were involved in building the "Bird's Nest".&lt;ref name=ReuDie&gt;{{cite news |first= Nick|last= Mulvenney|author2=Alex Richardson |title= Beijing says 2 died in Bird's Nest construction|url= http://uk.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUKPEK10105320080128?pageNumber=1&amp;virtualBrandChannel=0&amp;sp=true|publisher= [[Reuters]]|date= 28 Jan 2008|accessdate=29 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Workers 工人'' documents the human side of construction with worker portraits, information on the workers themselves, and details on how Couchman carried out the project.  In December 2007, Couchman circumvented security on the Olympic construction site and was able to approach the workers about taking their pictures.&lt;ref&gt;Toy, Mary-Anne. [http://www.theage.com.au/world/silent-workers-get-their-moment-to-shine-before-the-games-begin-20080807-3rjd.html "Silent workers get their moment to shine before the games begin"], ''The Age'', 7 August 2008.

Retrieved 29 May 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  She later returned to the site with two copies of each photo, giving each of her subjects one copy to keep and asked the workers to write their name and hometown on the other.&lt;ref&gt;Levin, Dan. [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/10/arts/design/10expatsweb.html?_r=1 "For Expatriates in China, Creative Lives of Plenty"], ''The New York Times'', 8 January 2010. Retrieved 29 May 2011&lt;/ref&gt;  Couchman felt that the element of exchange was key to this project.&lt;ref&gt;Ghomeshi, Jian. [http://podcast.cbc.ca/mp3/qpodcast_20080630_6503.mp3 "Q: Arts and Culture"], ''CBC Radio'', 30 June 2008, Retrieved 13 July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==
In the book's introduction, British art critic Peter Suchin writes that the way Couchman positions the workers at roughly the same spot for each portrait suggests they can also be seen as "one single portrait, that of `the worker' engaged in the making of the Place of the Games ... the central focus, the essential signifier of the new Beijing".  Photographs from this series were exhibited in [[London]], England and [[Hong Kong]]. Discussions of workers' rights have been raised in the context of this book, but it was not Couchman's reason for starting the project.&lt;ref&gt;Ng, Tse-wei.

'''Ximena Zomosa''' (born 1966, [[Santiago de Chile|Santiago]], [[Chile]]) is a [[Visual arts|visual artist]] and [[curator]] who works in [[contemporary art]]&lt;ref name=ref_11 /&gt; and [[conceptual art]],&lt;ref name=ref_1 /&gt; whose work demonstrates — from the perspective of [[gender]]&lt;ref name=ref_3 /&gt; — a discourse that is fundamentally feminine.&lt;ref name=ref_4 /&gt; She acted in a managerial and curatorial capacity at the Balmaceda Youth Art Gallery, a space for art by emerging Chilean artists.&lt;ref name=ref_10&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zomosa studied art at the [[Pontifical Catholic University of Chile]], which complemented her studies at various Chilean universities.&lt;ref name=ref_1 /&gt; Her work is characterized by "la originalidad mostrada en el empleo de materiales sacados de la vida cotidiana y dispuestos en instalaciones inusuales (...). En su afán transformatorio, es evidente un sentido autobiográfico e irónico frente a lo femenino y lo doméstico" ("originality demonstrated in the use of materials from everyday life and displayed in unusual installations (...). In her eager transformation, there is a sense of the autobiographical and irony in the face of that which is feminine and that which is domestic").&lt;ref name=ref_1 /&gt;

In 2004, Zomosa received the [[Altazor Award|Altazor Award of the National Arts]] in the category of Installations and Video Art for ''Colección de la artista'' (''Artist's Collection'').&lt;ref name=ref_2&gt;{{Cite web
