'''Abraham ben Isaac of Granada'''  also '''Abraham Merimon''' was a [[Kabbalist]] of the thirteenth century.

==Works==
Abraham wrote:

*A work on the [[Kabbalah|Kabbala]], under the title of ''Sefer ha-Berit.'' This is quoted by [[Moses Botarel]] in the introduction to his commentary on the ''Sefer Yeẓirah,'' which passage contains a reference to [[Maimonides]]' ''Moreh.''
*Another work on the Kabbala, under the title ''[[Berit Menuchah|Berit Menuḥah]],'' valued highly by [[Isaac Luria]] for its profound comments. Its language, as well as the manner in which [[Simon ben Yohai]] is introduced as speaker, shows striking resemblance to the [[Zohar]], and it may be that the author had a larger version of the Zohar before him than is now extant. Unlike the Zohar however, Berit Menuḥah is primarily focused on practical kabbalah and the powers of divine names.
*A work entitled ''Megalle ha-Ta'alumot,'' quoted by the author in the work previously mentioned.

The '''Babushka Lady''' is an unknown woman present during the 1963 [[John F. Kennedy assassination|assassination of President John F. Kennedy]] who might have photographed the events that occurred in [[Dallas]]'s [[Dealey Plaza]] at the time [[John F. Kennedy|President John F. Kennedy]] was shot. Her nickname arose from the [[headscarf]] she wore, which was similar to scarves worn by elderly [[Women in Russia|Russian women]]  ([[wikt:babushka|бабушка]]&amp;nbsp;– ''babushka''&amp;nbsp;– literally means "grandmother" or "old woman" in [[Russian language|Russian]]).

The Babushka Lady was seen to be holding a camera by eyewitnesses and was also seen in film accounts of the assassination.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mcadams.posc.mu.edu/muchmore.jpg Muchmore frame]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.assassinationresearch.com/zfilm/z285.jpg Zapruder Frame 285]&lt;/ref&gt; She was observed standing on the grass between Elm and Main streets and is visible in the [[Zapruder film]] as well as in the films of [[Orville Nix]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jfk-online.com/1nix.html |title=JFK Assassination Films |publisher=Jfk-online.com |date= |accessdate=2009-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marie Muchmore]], and Mark Bell&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jfk-online.com/1bell.html |title=JFK Assassination Films |publisher=Jfk-online.com |date= |accessdate=2009-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; (44 minutes and 47 seconds into the Bell film: even though the shooting had already taken place and most of her surrounding witnesses took cover, she can be seen still standing with the camera at her face). After the shooting, she crossed Elm Street and joined the crowd that went up the [[grassy knoll]]. She is last seen in photographs walking east on Elm Street. Neither she, nor the film she may have taken, has yet been positively identified; no known photograph with her in frame captured her face because in all cases she was either facing away from the camera, or (as in the case of the Zapruder film) had her face obscured by her own camera.

==Beverly Oliver's claim==
In 1970, a woman named Beverly Oliver told conspiracy researcher Gary Shaw at a church [[revival meeting]] in [[Joshua, Texas]] that she was the Babushka Lady.&lt;ref name="Bugliosi"&gt;{{cite book |last=Bugliosi |first=Vincent |authorlink=Vincent Bugliosi |title=Reclaiming History: The Assassination of President John F. Kennedy |year=2007 |publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company |location=New York |isbn=0-393-04525-0 |page=1405 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oliver stated that she filmed the assassination with a [[Super-8|Super 8 film]] [[Yashica]] and that she turned the undeveloped film over to two men who identified themselves to her as FBI agents.&lt;ref name="Bugliosi"/&gt; According to Oliver, she obtained no receipt from the men who told her that they would return the film to her within ten days. She did not follow up with an inquiry.&lt;ref name="Bugliosi"/&gt; She reiterated her claims in the 1988 documentary ''[[The Men Who Killed Kennedy]]''.&lt;ref name="Bugliosi"/&gt; According to [[Vincent Bugliosi]], Oliver "has never proved to most people's satisfaction that she was in Dealey Plaza that day."&lt;ref name="Bugliosi"/&gt; Confronted with the fact that the Yashica Super-8 camera was not made until 1969, she stated that she received the "experimental" camera from a friend and was not even sure the manufacturer's name was on it.&lt;ref name="Bugliosi"/&gt;

Beverly Oliver's claims&lt;!-- stones says she "claimed" these things --&gt; were the basis for a scene in [[Oliver Stone]]'s 1991 film ''[[JFK (film)|JFK]]'', in which a character named "Beverly" meets [[Jim Garrison]] in a Dallas nightclub.&lt;ref name="Stone"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Stone |first1=Oliver |authorlink1=Oliver Stone |last2=Sklar  |first2=Zachary |authorlink2= |title=JFK: The Book of the Film : The Documented Screenplay |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GyskeQlVFfkC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=June 7, 2012 |year=1992 |publisher=Applause Books |location=New York |isbn=9781557831279 |pages=119–121 |chapter=JFK: The Documented Screenplay |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=GyskeQlVFfkC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA119#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Played by [[Lolita Davidovich]], she is depicted in the [[director's cut]] as wearing a headscarf at Dealey Plaza and speaking of having given the film she shot to two men claiming to be FBI agents.

==House Select Committee on Assassinations report==
In March 1979, the Photographic Evidence Panel of the [[United States House Select Committee on Assassinations]] indicated that they were unable to locate any film attributed to the Babushka Lady.&lt;ref name="HCSA-VI"&gt;{{cite book |title=Appendix to Hearings before the Select Committee on Assassinations of the U.S. House of Representatives |url=http://www.maryferrell.org/mffweb/archive/viewer/showDoc.do?docId=958 |volume=VI Photographic Evidence |year=1979 |publisher=United States Government Printing Office |location=Washington, D.C. |page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to their report: "Initially, [[Robert J. Groden|Robert Groden]], a photographic consultant to the committee advised the panel as to pertinent photographic issues and related materials. Committee investigators located many of the suggested films and photographs, however, some items were never located, i.e. the Babushka Lady film, a color photograph by Norman Similas, and the original negative of the Betzner photograph."&lt;ref name="HCSA-VI"/&gt;

==Public hearings of the Assassination Records Review Board==
On November 18, 1994, assassination researcher Gary Mack testified before the [[Assassination Records Review Board]] that he had recently been told by an executive in [[Kodak]]'s Dallas office that a woman in her early 30s with brunette hair brought in film purported to be of the assassination scene while they were processing the [[Zapruder film]].&lt;ref name="ARRB"&gt;{{cite book |title=United States of America Assassination Records Review Board: Public Hearing |url=http://www.maryferrell.org/mffweb/archive/viewer/showDoc.do?docId=145536 |type= |edition= |series= |date=November 18, 1994 |origyear= |publisher=United States Government Printing Office |location=Washington, D.C. |pages=25–26, 41–43}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Mack, the executive said the woman explained to federal investigators already at the film processing office that she ran from Main Street across the grass to Elm Street where she stopped and snapped a photo with some people in the foreground of the [[SS-100-X|presidential limousine]] and the [[Texas School Book Depository]].&lt;ref name="ARRB"/&gt; Mack said that he was told by the Kodak executive that the photo was extremely blurry and "virtually useless" and indicated that the woman likely went home without anyone recording her identification.&lt;ref name="ARRB"/&gt; After suggesting that the woman in the story may have been the Babushka Lady, Mack then told the Board: "I do not believe that Beverly Oliver is the Babushka Lady, or, let me rephrase that, she certainly could be but the rest of the story is a fabrication."&lt;ref name="ARRB"/&gt;

Also appearing that same day before the ARRB as "Beverly Oliver Massegee", Oliver stated that she was 17 years old at the time of the assassination.&lt;ref name="ARRB"/&gt; She told the Board that she was filming with an "experimental" [[8 mm film|8 mm movie camera]] approximately {{convert|20|to|30|ft|0&lt;!--"approximately"--&gt;}} from Kennedy when he was shot and that the film was confiscated by a man who identified himself as an FBI agent.&lt;ref name="ARRB"/&gt; According to Oliver, she handed over the camera because the man was an authority figure and because she feared being caught in possession of [[Cannabis (drug)|marijuana]].&lt;ref name="ARRB"/&gt;

He became prominent in mid-2011 for his work supporting the Libyan revolution through international lobbying and was consequently appointed as a Special Envoy to the Libyan [[National Transitional Council]] (NTC) on 4 September 2011.&lt;ref name="inlifo-Sep5-2011"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.inlifo.eu/blog/president-ilf-appointed-special-envoy-tnc|title=President of ILF appointed as special envoy to the TNC.|author=richard|date=September 5, 2011|publisher=Independent Libya Foundation|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130131131954/http://www.inlifo.eu/blog/president-ilf-appointed-special-envoy-tnc|archive-date=September 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

In 2004, Igtet formed Swiss International Management AG&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.moneyhouse.ch/p/igtet_abdul_basit-5342866/index.htm|language=de|title=Abdul-Basit Igtet - Zürich|website=Moneyhouse}}&lt;/ref&gt; which provides business services to the [[State of Qatar]].

During 2005 and 2006, he facilitated the grouping of 12 German engineering companies into one holding which proceeded to provide a civil engineering and architectural facility to the [[State of Qatar]].

In 2006 he established the Swiss Mideast Finance Group which became an advisor to [[Qatari Diar]].

In 2007, he was involved in the transfer of Metrica, a maritime, aviation and residential interior design company based in Germany.

Currently in his latest projects, [http://www.athal.ly/ Athal Energy] which is an independent Libyan oil and gas company established by him in 2011. Basit Iget is the chairman of the company and the company focuses on infrastructure projects and development and exploration of existing oil fields in Libya.

The company is specialized mainly on the exploration, production and marketing of crude oil and natural gas in Libya.

Note, the above is what Basit Igtet has alleged, however, as of 2018, Athal Energy does not appear to exist.  According to Archive.org &lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20180326090908/http://athal.ly/#about-us&lt;/ref&gt;, the last date the Athal Energy website was archived, it was not an oil and gas company.  It said the following:
"Athal is a distributor and wholesaler of pharmaceuticals, medical equipment, hospital supplies, over the counter medicines and healthcare products."

In 2010 Igtet founded the Independent Libya Foundation (ILF) together with New York-based businessman [[Adam M. Hock]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720095019/http://inlifo.org/ |archive-date=July 20, 2011 |title=Independent Libya Foundation|url=http://inlifo.org/  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ILF initially focused on supporting the fledgling rebel movement, and upon its founding, the Libyan [[National Transitional Council]]. Igtet lobbied for support from the international community to augment the process of recognition of the NTC as the sole legitimate governing body on Libya.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

In March 2011, he hosted General [[Abdul Fatah Younis]], former Interior Minister of Libya (under the Gaddafi government), turned leader of the rebel armed forces in the EU capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Pro-insurgency Libya office opens in Brussels|url=http://www.eubusiness.com/news-eu/libya-conflict-nato.9pq/|accessdate=24 November 2011|date=28 April 2011|website=EUbusiness}}&lt;/ref&gt; Igtet facilitated dialogue between Younis and [[NATO]] during a critical time for the rebel movement which ultimately saw the NATO led [[2011 military intervention in Libya]] to defend the Libyan people from Gaddafi forces. ( It is claim, no evidence ; it needs resource).
On 14 June 2011, he met with the president of [[Panama]], [[Ricardo Martinelli]] at the Palace of the Herons ([[Palacio de las Garzas]]) to lobby for official recognition of the NTC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.presidencia.gob.pa/noticia-presidente-numero-2577.html Official website of the Republic of Panama  ( It is claim, no evidence ; it needs resources).

In doing so, Panama became the 14th nation worldwide to recognize the NTC in this manner.&lt;ref&gt;[[International recognition of the National Transitional Council]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=May 2017}} 

On 25 August 2011, Igtet met with the president of [[Colombia]], [[Juan Manuel Santos]] at the Nariño Palace ([[Casa de Nariño]]) to lobby for official recognition of the NTC.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}} On the same day, Colombia became the 54th nation worldwide to recognize the NTC.  ( It is claim, no evidence ; it needs resources).

On 4 September 2011, Igtet was appointed as Special Envoy to the Libyan [[National Transitional Council]] for humanitarian aid from the area of [[North America]] and [[South America]].&lt;ref name="inlifo-Sep5-2011" /&gt; 

On 19 November 2011, Igtet organized an ILF delegation in Benghazi, Libya to present strategies for rebel re-integration.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cnbc.com/id/45399887 CNBC coverage of November 19th Libya visit]{{Dead link|date=May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Philanthropy==
Igtet's track-record of philanthropy is virtually non-existent.
He alleges that he is involved in supporting a school in Cambodia to assist in the non-proliferation of child prostitution, but has never provided any proof of any such school existing. He sponsored one show at [[La Comédie Française]] at Paris in 2012&lt;ref&gt;https://www.comedie-francaise.fr/www/comedie/media/document/programme-peergynt1112.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''Robert Todd Schilling''' (born January 23, 1964) is a former [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] for {{ushr|IL|17}}, serving from 2011 to 2013. Schilling is a member of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. Schilling challenged incumbent [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Phil Hare]] in the [[Illinois's 17th congressional district election, 2010|2010 election]] and defeated him by ten points.&lt;ref name="gen election"/&gt; In the 2012 election, he was defeated by [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Cheri Bustos]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seattlepi.com/news/article/Schilling-Looking-forward-to-making-pizza-again-4016186.php Schilling: Looking forward to making pizza again]{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}. [[Seattle Post Intelligencer]]. November 7, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, he ran for his former seat, but lost again to Bustos.

==Early life, education, and business career==
Schilling was born and raised in [[Rock Island, Illinois]]. He graduated from [[Alleman High School (Rock Island, Illinois)|Alleman Catholic High School]] and attended [[Black Hawk College]].&lt;ref name="politics, pizza"/&gt;

Schilling worked at [[Container Corporation of America]] between 1983 and 1987 and was a union steward for the local chapter of the [[Paper, Allied-Industrial, Chemical and Energy Workers International Union|United Paper Workers International Union]]. He then  worked as an insurance agent for [[Prudential Financial|Prudential Insurance Company]] between 1987 and 1995, where he was ranked in the top 5% of all Prudential agents during his last year.&lt;ref name="politics, pizza"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bobby1"/&gt;  He was also the treasurer for the [[United Food and Commercial Workers]] Union&lt;ref name="politics, pizza"/&gt; for four of those years.&lt;ref name="bobby1"/&gt;

In 1996, he and his wife opened Saint Giuseppe's Heavenly Pizza in [[Moline, Illinois]];&lt;ref name="politics, pizza"/&gt; the restaurant is still owned by the family and Schilling ran the restaurant until taking office, when he left his son in charge.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/28/us/politics/28freshman.html Hardly Settled in House, but Already in Hot Seat]&lt;/ref&gt; According to public personal financial disclosures, Schilling's restaurant has dropped in value from a range of $100,000 to $250,000 down to between $50,000–$100,000. Schilling's son and campaign manager Terry Schilling said, "The real estate market has really taken a hit in East Moline. It just goes to show that Bobby Schilling has a real stake in this economy."&lt;ref&gt;[http://qconline.com/archives/qco/display.php?stopRedirect=true&amp;id=597431 Report lists assets, income, debts for Schilling, Bustos]&lt;/ref&gt;

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Elections===

====2010====
{{Main|Illinois's 17th congressional district election, 2010}}
{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in Illinois, 2010#District 17}}

Schilling grew up as a Democrat, but has become more conservative over the years and now characterizes himself as a "Reagan Republican."&lt;ref name="pizza-place owner"/&gt; He was also influenced by radio and television personality [[Glenn Beck]]. Schilling was one of the 9–12 Candidates, a group led by Beck, and signed the 9–12 contract of principles and values.&lt;ref name="politics, pizza"/&gt; Schilling has said he was inspired to run for office because he was preparing to [[franchising|franchise]] his restaurant, but cancelled his plans when he saw then-Presidential candidate [[Barack Obama]] telling [[Joe the Plumber]] that the government needed to "spread the wealth around."&lt;ref name="politics, pizza"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fueled"/&gt; Schilling announced his candidacy in April 2009&lt;ref name="pizza shop owner"/&gt;&lt;ref name="daily review"/&gt; and officially filed for the Republican nomination in October 2009.&lt;ref name="set for primary"/&gt;&lt;ref name="press release"/&gt;

Schilling vowed not to participate in the [[congressional pension]] program, to keep his private health insurance instead of the congressional plan, to donate any pay raises he receives, to limit himself to no more than eight years in Congress, and not to vote for any bill he hasn't read.&lt;ref name="conditional support"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bobby's contract"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pledges to serve"/&gt; "I'm not going to make a career out of this," he says.&lt;ref name="keep moving"/&gt;

Early in the campaign, political websites rated the 17th District race "safe Democratic." However, by Election Day the race was rated "leans Republican" by [[RealClearPolitics]], [[Cook Political Report]], [[CQ Politics]], and ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;ref name="race profile"/&gt;&lt;ref name="race detail"/&gt;&lt;ref name="real clear politics"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cook political"/&gt; The race was profiled on [[CNN]] as one of the country's top 100 House races, in which they said, "Schilling trails in the overall money race, but he's raised enough to get his message out and give the incumbent something to worry about."&lt;ref name="newcomer"/&gt;

In September 2010, Schilling was named to the [[National Republican Congressional Committee]]'s "[[GOP Young Gun|Young Guns]]" program.&lt;ref name="young guns"/&gt;

Hare criticized Schilling for living 0.99 miles outside the 17th District, though the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] only requires congressmen to live in the state they wish to represent.&lt;ref name="pizza-place owner"/&gt; Schilling's wife notes that the family's restaurant is in the 17th and employs people and pays taxes there.&lt;ref name="pizza-place owner"/&gt; She also says the family fell out of the district because of [[gerrymandering]].&lt;ref name="pizza-place owner"/&gt;

Unopposed in the primary election,&lt;ref name="politics, pizza"/&gt; in the general election, Schilling won by an unexpectedly large margin, taking 53 percent of the vote to Hare's 43 percent.  Notably, he carried Hare's home county, [[Rock Island County]], a normally heavily Democratic county that is home to the district's two largest cities, Moline and Rock Island, by nine points.&lt;ref name="gen election"/&gt; After the election, Schilling hired as his [[chief of staff]] Mike Roman, a political consultant known for posting a video showing [[New Black Panther Party voter intimidation case|alleged voter intimidation]] during the 2008 presidential election.&lt;ref name="hires chief"/&gt; Roman, along with policy director Scott Tranter, resigned from Schilling's office in April 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.herald-review.com/news/state-and-regional/article_13b089ee-5f3c-11e0-be82-001cc4c002e0.html |title= Top Schilling staffers resign |author= Ed Tibbetts |date= April 5, 2011 |work= Decatur Herald-Review |publisher= |accessdate=April 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schilling's campaign set an off-year fundraising record for a challenger in the 17th district, amassing about $89,000 in 2009. Schilling's campaign fundraising relied largely on individual donors, who accounted for about 80 percent of the $1 million raised by his campaign.&lt;ref name="herald-review1"/&gt; Hare depended more heavily on [[political action committees]], who contributed about two-thirds of his campaigns $1.3 million total. Following his election, Schilling has relied more on political action committees to help retire his campaign debt, with the bulk of his December 2010 fundraising coming from PACs, including [[Wal-Mart]], the [[American Medical Association]], [[Caterpillar Inc.]] and [[Archer Daniels Midland]] Co.&lt;ref name="herald-review1"/&gt;

Schilling ended the campaign with a total of $1,095,167 raised and $1,078,911 spent.&lt;ref name="FEC"/&gt;

The following organizations endorsed Schilling in his 2010 run for Congress: The Illinois Federation for the [[Right to Life]] PAC;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ifrl-pac.com/elections/2010/primary/endorsements/ |publisher=Illinois Federation for Right to Life |title=2010 Illinois Primary Election Page—Endorsements For the February 2, 2010 primary election|accessdate=2015-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[CatholicVote]] PAC;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicvote.org/index.php?%2Fsite%2Fcandidates%2FBobby_Schilling%2F&amp;state=Illinois |title=Candidates |publisher=CatholicVote.org |date= |accessdate=February 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Quincy, Illinois|Quincy]] Tea Party group;&lt;ref name="conditional support"/&gt; [[John Deere]] PAC;&lt;ref name="deere pac"/&gt; and the [[United States Chamber of Commerce]].&lt;ref name="parlor to power"/&gt;

Individuals who endorsed Schilling included: [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] [[Aaron Schock]] (R-IL);&lt;ref name="aaron schock"/&gt; U.S. Representative [[Michele Bachmann]] (R-MN);&lt;ref name="bachmann"/&gt; former [[Governor of Massachusetts]] [[Mitt Romney]];&lt;ref name="mitt romney"/&gt; political figure and author [[Joe the Plumber]] (Joe Wurzelbacher);&lt;ref name="plumber stumps"/&gt; and, [[John F. Baker, Jr.|Sgt. John F. Baker, Jr.]], recipient of the [[Medal of Honor]].&lt;ref name="hero's endorsement"/&gt;

Newspapers were evenly divided in endorsing Schilling over Hare, with the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' and&lt;ref name="qctimes2697"/&gt; the ''Sauk Valley News'' among those supporting Schilling.&lt;ref name="svn editorial board"/&gt; In October 2010 Schilling was endorsed by the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]''.&lt;ref name="qctimes2697"/&gt;

====2012====
{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in Illinois, 2012#District 17}}
Schilling ran for re-election in [[United States elections, 2012|2012]]&lt;ref name=qct&gt;{{cite web|url=http://qctimes.com/news/local/article_eaccbc5e-8d54-11e0-b252-001cc4c03286.html|title=Hare rules out another run for Congress|date=June 3, 2011|accessdate=June 6, 2011|work=[[Quad-City Times]]|first=Ed|last=Tibbetts}}&lt;/ref&gt; and faced Democrat and former [[East Moline]] City Council Alderwoman [[Cheri Bustos]] in the general election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.pjstar.com/news/x1704641155/Bustos-will-face-Schilling-for-17th-District-seat|title= Bustos will face Schilling for 17th Congressional seat|author= John Sharp|date= March 20, 2012|publisher =''Peoria Journal Star''|accessdate=May 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has been added to the National Republican Congressional Committee's Patriot Program, which is designed to defend incumbent Republicans.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/house-races/180841-nrcc-adds-10-members-to-incumbent-protection-program NRCC adds 10 members to incumbent-protection program]&lt;/ref&gt; Bustos received a significant assist from the 2010 round of redistricting.  The 17th already had a modest Democratic lean, but the Democratic-controlled legislature redrew the district to make it even more Democratic.  Notably, [[Quincy, Illinois|Quincy]], [[Decatur, Illinois|Decatur]] and the district's share of [[Springfield, Illinois|Springfield]] were cut out, replaced by the more Democratic portions of [[Peoria, Illinois|Peoria]] and [[Rockford, Illinois|Rockford]].  [[National Journal]]'s [[Cook Political Report]] named Schilling one of the top 10 Republicans most vulnerable to redistricting in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.nationaljournal.com/top-10-republicans-most-vulnerable-to-redistricting-20110415|title= Top 10 Republicans Most Vulnerable to Redistricting  |author1=David Wasserman  |author2=Julia Edwards |lastauthoramp=yes |date= April 15, 2011|work= Cook Political Report|publisher= National Journal|accessdate=April 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schilling has raised $1.4 million and had $950,000 cash on hand as of June 30, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;FEC Records&lt;/ref&gt;

While initially rated as a "lean-Democrat" race by major sites, in September 2012, ''[[Roll Call (newspaper)|Roll Call]]'', the [[Cook Political Report]], and the Rothenburg Political Report upgraded the race to "toss-up",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://news.mywebpal.com/news_tool_v2.cfm?show=localnews&amp;pnpID=469&amp;NewsID=1022530&amp;CategoryID=20359&amp;on=1&amp;#93;# |title=Archived copy |access-date=May 16, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110402231012/http://news.mywebpal.com/news_tool_v2.cfm?show=localnews# |archive-date=April 2, 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; with Cook saying Schilling had an advantage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Murphy |first=Erin |url=http://www.thonline.com/blogs/tri_state_politics/article_22d3beec-01d3-11e2-8800-001a4bcf6878.html |title=Rating the races: U.S. House and Senate – THonline.com: Tri State Politics |publisher=THonline.com |date=2012-09-18 |accessdate=2015-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the November 2012 elections, Bustos defeated Schilling by a 53%–47% margin. According to the [[Seattle Post Intelligencer]], Schilling was "looking forward to focusing again on his pizza business after losing a second term."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seattlepi.com/news/article/Schilling-Looking-forward-to-making-pizza-again-4016186.php Schilling: Looking forward to making pizza again]{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} ''Seattle Post Intelligencer''.

===Tenure===
Schilling's wife and 10 children attended the congressional swearing-in on January 5, 2011, attracting some notice and an interview with Diane Sawyer.&lt;ref name="Illinois' 5"/&gt; His early actions as a congressman included joining 25 other freshman Republicans in voting against extending the [[USA PATRIOT Act]]; Schilling stated he believed that the bill may not provide sufficient safeguards on who is allowed to access personal information,&lt;ref name="read bill"/&gt; and that the 45 minutes allotted for floor debate was inadequate to discuss these concerns.&lt;ref name="why did"/&gt;  Following Obama's late January 2011 State of the Union address in which the President said he was "eager" to work with critics of [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act|his health care reform law]], Schilling sent a letter to Obama requesting a one-on-one meeting.&lt;ref name="literalist"/&gt;

In February 2011, Schilling joined 130 House Republicans in voting against a $450 million budget cut for an extra F-35 fighter-jet engine—a project that the [[United States Department of Defense|U.S. Department of Defense]] had repeatedly tried to kill, and that Defense Secretary [[Robert Gates]] called "a waste of nearly 3 billion."&lt;ref name="kill engine"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://politics.nytimes.com/congress/votes/112/house/1/46 |work=The New York Times |title=House Vote 46 – Cancels F-35 Jet Engine Program |access-date=April 8, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110310090624/http://politics.nytimes.com/congress/votes/112/house/1/46# |archive-date=March 10, 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Schilling voted for a package of cuts that included a $230 million federal grant to build an [[Amtrak]] line from [[Chicago]] to [[Iowa City]], though he had supported the project during his campaign, calling it  "critically important to both the economy and the environment of the Midwest."&lt;ref name="politics, pizza"/&gt; The planned rail line was a celebrated project by many in his district, including local mayors.&lt;ref name="defends vote"/&gt; Schilling defended his vote, arguing it was a question of prioritizing, separating wants from needs, and when he looked at the big picture, the rail service did not make the cut.&lt;ref name="defends vote"/&gt; He also stated that his constituents elected him to address national debt and deficit problems in Washington, not to take a business-as-usual approach.&lt;ref name="archives"/&gt;

In June 2011, Schilling introduced a bill to prevent members of Congress from receiving their congressional pension before they reach the [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] retirement age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Long |first=Emily |url=http://www.govexec.com/dailyfed/0611/062711l1.htm |title=Proposal would make lawmakers wait longer to tap pensions – Pay &amp; Benefits |publisher=GovExec.com |date=2011-06-27 |accessdate=2015-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

You just don't know what people are thinking...It's something we're not going to take lightly."&lt;ref name="cnnthreat"/&gt;

''Yankees in the Afternoon: An Illustrated History of American Bullfighters''.

Boston, Little Brown: 1962. pp. 5-6.&lt;/ref&gt; Though he had learned some swordfighting and bullfighting skills in Spain before his arrival in the United States, he was a poor fighter. In 1903, he suffered an attack of nerves before a fight in Mexico and failed to fight.&lt;ref name="hail"/&gt; In 1904, he was a key figure in the [[St. Louis bullfight riot]], which led to the destruction of a 14,000-seat arena by fire. Three days after the riot, he shot and killed fellow matador [[Don Manuel Cervera]] after the other man attacked Bass with a knife over a dispute regarding the bullfight canceled by the riot.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nyti.ms/WM3VCO "Bullfighter Murdered,"] ''The New York Times''.

'''Clare Cooper Marcus''' is a prominent educator in [[landscape architecture]] and architecture and a pioneer in the field of social issues in housing, open space design, and healing landscapes. 

Clare Cooper Marcus was born in 1934 and raised in a north London suburb. She received her undergraduate degree in historical geography from [[University College, London]] and a Masters in urban and cultural Geography from [[University of Nebraska–Lincoln|University of Nebraska at Lincoln]]. She returned to England to teach cartography at the [[University of Sheffield]], and worked as urban planner at the Ministry of Housing and [[London County Council]]. She returned to the US and earned a second Masters in City and Regional Planning from the [[University of California at Berkeley]] in 1965. She participated in counter-culture movement in the 1960s at Berkeley, joining in the student strikes, and agitating for free speech. She was inspired by the writings of [[Catherine Bauer Wurster]] on housing programs and [[Jane Jacobs]] on urban place-making&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Burt|first=Virginia|date=Summer 2014|title=THERAPEUTIC LANDSCAPES|url=|journal=Landscapes/Paysages|volume=16 no.2|pages=54-57|via=EBSCO}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Marcus worked for several years as a research associate in the Institute of Urban and Regional Development at the [[University of California, Berkeley|University of California at Berkeley]] and began teaching in the Department of  Landscape Architecture in 1969. Her course on Social and Psychological Factors in Open Space Design was popular among undergraduate and graduate students alike. She held a joint appointment in the Department of Architecture where she taught seminars on social aspects of housing design, environments for the life cycle, and sense of place. She collaborated with many of her former students in writing articles and editing books.

Marcus was married to the landscape architect Stephen Marcus with whom she has two children, Jason and Lucy. After having retired from full-time teaching in 1994, she writes, travels, and consults. She is the Principal of the firm Healing Landscapes specializing in healthcare settings and regularly teaches healthcare garden design at the [[Chicago Botanic Garden]]. She has received numerous awards, including for exemplary design research from the [[National Endowment for the Arts]], career award from the [[Environmental Design Research Association]] (EDRA), and a [[Guggenheim Fellowship]]. Her co-edited (with Carolyn Francis) volume ''People Places: Design Guidelines for Urban Open Space'' received a Merit Award from the [[American Society of Landscape Architects]] in 2000 and ''Healing Gardens: Therapeutic Benefits and Design Recommendations'' (co-edited with Marni Barnes) won the EDRA Award for Place Research in 2000.

She found these spaces to be well-used by residents, particularly by children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Marcus|first=Clare Cooper|year=2003|title=Shared Outdoor Space and Community Life|url=|journal=Places|volume=|pages=32–41|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her articles and book (with Wendy Sarkissian) ''Housing as if People Mattered: Site Design Guidelines for Medium-Density Family Housing'' published by the [[University of California Press]] in 1986 showed how medium density, low-rise cluster housing is supportive of families with children and a catalyst in building social networks.  Marcus expanded her studies on open spaces in housing to other types—neighborhood and city parks, plazas, and campus open spaces in her edited volume (with Carolyn Francis) ''People Places: Design Guidelines for Urban Open Space'' first published by [[Van Nostrand Reinhold]] in 1990. She translated her findings in performance guidelines that would aid the designer and bridge the gap between research and practice.

The formative years of Marcus' childhood were spent in [[Buckinghamshire]] countryside during World War II where her family was evacuated from London. There she was free to explore the landscape and developed a lifelong affinity for the natural outdoors. She encouraged her design students to remember their own childhood environments and write their environmental autobiography to discover hidden biases while designing for their clients.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Marcus|first=Clare|year=1978|title=Remembrances of Landscapes Past|url=|journal=Landscape|volume=22|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marcus' work shows the impact of human potential movement in California in the 1960s. She attended seminars in the Carl Jung Institute in San Francisco and the [[Esalen Institute]] in [[Big Sur]] to delve deep into topics such as the [[age of Aquarius]], sacred geometries in the landscape,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Marcus|first=Clare Cooper|year=1987|title=Alternative Landscapes Ley-Lines, Feng-shui and the Gaia Hypotheses|url=|journal=Landscape|volume=29|pages=1–10|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; self-transformation and becoming whole through integration of feminine and  masculine [[archetype]]s. She wrote about the garden as a symbol of the higher self and the role of gardening in creating the spiritual community of Findhorn in Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Garden as Metaphor in Mark Francis and Randolph Hester (eds.) The Meaning of Gardens|last=Marcus|first=Clare Cooper|publisher=The MIT Press|year=1990|isbn=|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|pages=26–33}}&lt;/ref&gt; She adapted the [[Gestalt psychology|Gestalt]] role playing therapeutic technique in her research on house as symbol of the self&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The House as a Symbol of Self|last=Cooper|first=Clare|publisher=Institute of Urban &amp; Regional Development, University of California at Berkeley|year=1974|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; that was published as the book ''The House as a Mirror of Self: Exploring the Deeper Meaning of Home'' published by [[Conari Press]] in 1995. Marcus' own environmental autobiography and analysis of her self and growth are contained in ''Iona Dreaming: The Healing Power of Place'', ''A Memoir'' published by Nicholas-Hays, Inc. in 2010. In this book written after a double bout with cancer, she reveals the remarkable power of place to heal psychological wounds and restore the spirit.

Marcus has continued her research on restorative environments in the book (with Marni Barnes) ''Gardens in Healthcare Facilities:  Uses, Therapeutic Benefits, and Design Recommendations''  published by The Center for Health Design, Inc. (Martinez, California) in 1995; in the edited volume (with Marni Barnes) ''Healing Gardens: Therapeutic Benefits and Design Recommendations''  published by [[John Wiley &amp; Sons]] in 1999; and the book (with Naomi Sachs) ''Therapeutic Landscapes: An Evidence-Based Approach to Designing Healing Gardens and Restorative Outdoor Spaces''  published by John Wiley &amp; Sons in 2014.

'''Floyd Bjørnstjerne Olson''' (November 13, 1891 – August 22, 1936) was an American politician and lawyer. He served as the [[List of Governors of Minnesota|22nd]] [[Governor of Minnesota]] from January 6, 1931, to August 22, 1936, dying in office of [[stomach cancer]]. Olson was a member of the [[Minnesota Farmer-Labor Party]], and the first member of that party to win the office of governor. He is consistently considered one of the greatest governors in [[Minnesota]] history and one of the most influential American politicians of his era.

== Early life ==
{{Refimprove section|date=June 2018}}
Floyd B. Olson was born on the north side of [[Minneapolis]], Minnesota, the only child of a [[Norway|Norwegian]] father and a [[Sweden|Swedish]] mother. The North Side neighborhood where Olson grew up was the home of a sizable [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jewish]] community, and Olson's friendships with some of the local Jewish families led him to serve as a [[shabbos goy]], assisting Jews on the Sabbath by performing actions they were not permitted to do. Olson picked up [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] from his childhood associations with his Jewish neighbors and years later spoke the language fluently while campaigning in Jewish communities, in addition to having several Jews serve him in advisory roles while in elected office.&lt;ref&gt;[[Steven Keillor|Keillor, Steven James]]. [https://books.google.com/books?id=eMXAqjIVeqcC&amp;pg=PA156&amp;lpg=PA156&amp;dq=%22Floyd+B.+Olson%22+yiddish ''Hjalmar Petersen of Minnesota: The Politics of Provincial Independence''], p. 156. [[Minnesota Historical Society Press]], 1987. {{ISBN|0-87351-211-1}}. Accessed January 22, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Jeffrey S. Gurock|Gurock, Jeffrey S.]] [https://books.google.com/books?id=5Ao_Pk5htcIC&amp;pg=PA481&amp;lpg=PA481&amp;dq=%20Floyd+B.+Olson%20+yiddish ''American Jewish History: an eight-volume series''], p. 249. [[Taylor &amp; Francis]], 1998. {{ISBN|0-415-91929-0}}. Accessed January 22, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

After graduating from [[North High School (Minneapolis, Minnesota)|North High School]] in Minneapolis in 1909, Olson went to work for the [[Northern Pacific Railway]]. The next year, he enrolled at the [[University of Minnesota]], but he left after only a year, during which he was always in trouble for wearing a [[derby hat|derby]] in violation of school rules and for refusing to participate in required [[Reserve Officers' Training Corps|ROTC]] drills.

Heading west, Olson worked a series of odd jobs in Canada and [[Alaska]] before settling briefly in [[Seattle]], Washington, where he became a [[stevedore]] and joined the [[Industrial Workers of the World]]. During this time, Olson read widely and began to adopt a [[populism|populist]], semi-socialist philosophy he would retain for the rest of his life.

Returning to Minnesota in 1913, Olson enrolled at [[William Mitchell College of Law]] (then the Northwestern College of Law), earning his degree in 1915. That same year, he met and married Ada Krejci in [[New Prague, Minnesota]] and became a practicing lawyer.

{{American socialism}}

== Hennepin County Attorney ==
In 1919, Olson was hired as an Assistant [[Hennepin County, Minnesota|Hennepin County]] Attorney and by the following year had himself become the Hennepin County Attorney after his former boss was fired for accepting [[bribery|bribes]].

During that period, he made his first foray into politics when he helped form the [[Committee of 48]], an organization that attempted to [[draft (politics)|draft]] Senator [[Robert M. La Follette, Sr.]] to run for [[President of the United States|president]] on a [[third party (United States)|third-party]] ticket. The effort proved unsuccessful, but La Follette would later run on the [[Progressive Party (United States, 1924)|Progressive Party]] ticket in 1924. That same year, Olson ran in the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] [[primary election|primary]] for the local seat in the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] but lost.

As Hennepin County Attorney, Olson quickly earned a name for himself as a stern [[prosecutor]] who relished going after crooked [[businessman|businessmen]]. He took on the [[Ku Klux Klan]] in a well-publicized case that brought both respect and [[death threat]]s and was reelected to the position in 1922 and 1926.

== Candidate for governor ==
In 1923, Olson brought a case against the leaders of the [[Minnesota Citizens Alliance]], a conservative business organization dedicated to preserving [[right-to-work law]]s, after they hired a [[hitman]] to [[dynamite]] the home of a [[trade union|union]] leader. Olson's vigorous pursuit of the Citizens Alliance made him a hero to the local [[labor movement]], which encouraged him to run for the [[Minnesota Farmer-Labor Party]]'s gubernatorial nomination in 1924.

Having secured the [[Political endorsement|endorsement]] of the Hennepin County Farmer-Labor Central Committee, Olson narrowly won the nomination in a bitterly fought primary. Buoyed by La Follette's presidential campaign (La Follette endorsed Olson and vice versa), he received 43% of the vote to [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] candidate [[Theodore Christianson]]'s 48%. Democratic candidate [[Carlos Avery]] came in a distant third with 6%.

Four years later, in 1928, the new "Farmer-Labor Association" (which had changed its name to avoid being linked with local communists) attempted to draft Olson to run for governor again. Although the party committee once again endorsed him and this time guaranteed that he would not face a primary battle, Olson declined to run. In the [[U.S. presidential election, 1928]], the Farmer-Labor candidate lost in the Republican landslide that accompanied [[Herbert Hoover]]'s election.

By 1930, however, the [[stock market]] had crashed, and the [[Great Depression]] had begun. After the party's newspaper urged that Olson be drafted, he easily won the nomination. Forming a coalition of farmers, [[trade union|organized labor]], and [[small business]]men, Olson swept to a landslide victory in the election, receiving 59% of the vote in a four-way race and winning 82 of the state's 87 [[County (United States)|counties]].

== Olson as Governor ==
At the time Olson assumed his office, [[Minnesota Legislature|Minnesota's legislature]] was officially [[nonpartisan]] but was in reality dominated by conservative Republicans who opposed most of what Olson stood for.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

Nevertheless, Olson soon proved himself skilled at the art of politics and managed to fulfill the vast majority of his campaign promises. During his three terms as governor, Olson proposed, and the legislature passed, bills that instituted a [[progressive tax|progressive income tax]], created a [[social security]] program for the elderly, expanded the state's [[conservation ethic|environmental conservation]] programs, guaranteed [[equal pay for women]] and the right to [[collective bargaining]], and instituted a [[minimum wage]] and a system of [[unemployment benefit|unemployment insurance]].

Despite these changes, the thing Olson wanted the most, a bill that would have put Minnesota's [[power station|electric utilities]], iron [[mining|mines]], [[oil field]]s, [[grain elevator]]s, and [[meat packing industry|meatpacking plants]] under [[Public ownership|state ownership]], never saw the light of day, as the legislature balked at what they saw as socialism and Olson insisted was "[[cooperative economics|cooperativism]]."

As the [[party platform|platform]] of his party grew successively more radical, Olson's support amongst the middle class gradually began to erode. His vigorous support from labor and agriculture, however, remained undiminished and he was easily reelected in 1932 and 1934.

In its April 24, 1933, issue, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine quoted Olson speaking from the steps of the state capitol:

"I am making a last appeal to the Legislature. If the Senate does not make provision for the sufferers in the State and the Federal Government refuses to aid, I shall invoke the powers I hold and shall declare martial law. ... A lot of people who are now fighting [relief] measures because they happen to possess considerable wealth will be brought in by provost guard and be obliged to give up more than they would now. There is not going to be misery in this State if I can humanly prevent it. . . Unless the Federal and State governments act to insure against recurrence of the present situation, I hope the present system of government goes right down to hell."
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Misery in Minnesota|url=http://content.time.com/time/subscriber/article/0,33009,769776,00.html|accessdate=24 March 2017|work=Time Magazine|issue=Volume XXI No. 14|date=24 April 1933}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 16, 1934, the trucker's union in Minneapolis started a strike ([[Minneapolis Teamsters Strike of 1934]]) that quickly resulted in open violence.  The violence ebbed and flowed for the next two months until Governor Olson declared martial law on July 26, and mobilized 4,000 National Guardsmen under the command of Adjutant General Ellard A. Walsh.  Walsh used a combination of checkpoints, security patrols, and curfews to restore order.  As the violence subsided, negotiations resumed, and an agreement was reached to end the labor dispute.&lt;ref name=MHSM&gt;{{cite web|last=Johnson|first=Jack|title=Mr. National Guard - Ellard A. Walsh 1887-1975|url=http://www.mnmilitarymuseum.org/files/4913/3374/8949/AlliesJan2012Final.pdf|publisher=Military Historical Society of Minnesota|accessdate=4 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite considerable achievements and widespread support, Olson's administration was marred by allegations made by crusading newspaper editor [[Walter Liggett]] that there were links between some members of his administration and organized crime. No evidence ever implicated Olson personally, however. Liggett was gunned down in front of his family in 1935. [[Kid Cann]], a Minnesota gangster, was charged with but not convicted of the killing.

== Final days ==
In 1935, Olson ruled out the possibility of running for President in the [[U.S. presidential election, 1936|1936 election]], as a third-party candidate. Instead, on November 18, 1935, he announced his intention to run against longtime incumbent [[Thomas Schall]] for one of Minnesota's [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]] seats.&lt;ref&gt;"Olson Planning to Run Against Senator Schall," Albert Lea Evening Tribune, 1935-11-19, at p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; His chances improved the next month when Senator Schall died in office following a road accident, and [[Elmer Benson]], the interim successor to Schall chosen by Olson, promised not to run for the seat in the 1936 election.

However, Olson's own health was beginning to fail. Having suffered from severe [[Peptic ulcer|ulcers]] ever since his election, Olson went to the [[Mayo Clinic]] in December 1935 and was diagnosed with [[stomach cancer]]. Although the cancer would eventually prove fatal, Olson was not told of the seriousness of his condition, as was the practice of the day.

Thus reassured of his "good health," Olson proceeded to further weaken himself by not only resuming his duties as governor but also beginning to organize his party's [[political convention|state convention]] and returning to his senatorial campaign. As he stumped across the state, promising to support federal ownership of [[monopoly|monopolies]], he further weakened his [[immune system]], allowing his cancer to [[metastasis|metastasize]].

Olson last made a public appearance on June 29, 1936, giving a stump speech in [[Minnehaha Falls|Minnehaha Park]] in Minneapolis. The next day, he returned to the Mayo Clinic for treatment, but it was too late. He died there on August 22 at the age of 44.

== Monuments ==

[[File:Monument to Floyd B. Olson, Minnesota State Capitol 2018-01-19.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Memorial in the Minnesota State Capitol]]
Since his death, dozens of [[statue]]s of Olson have been constructed throughout the state, many of which declare him to be the state's "greatest governor."

Shortly after Olson died, [[Minnesota State Highway 55]] (a highway that was then being constructed) was renamed the "Floyd B. Olson Memorial Highway" in his honor. A proposal by the [[Taxpayers League of Minnesota|Taxpayers League]] in late 2004 to rename the highway after the recently deceased President [[Ronald Reagan]] met with widespread public condemnation and was soon abandoned.&lt;ref name=Brain090404&gt;{{cite news|first=Mike|last=O'Rourke|title=Forget Reagan Highway|url=http://www.brainerddispatch.com/content/forget-reagan-highway|newspaper=Brainerd Dispatch|date=September 4, 2004|accessdate=February 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1974, [[Floyd B. Olson House|Olson's home]] at 1914 West 49th Street in [[Minneapolis]] was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].

'''Gamal Al Din Mohammed Hosni Ei Sayed Mubarak''' ({{lang-ar|جمال الدين محمد حسنى سيد مبارك}}, {{IPA-arz|ɡæˈmæːl edˈdiːn mæˈħæmmæd ˈħosni ˈsæjjed moˈbɑːɾɑk}}), (born 27 December 1963), is the younger of the two sons of former [[Egyptian President]] [[Hosni Mubarak]] and former First Lady [[Suzanne Mubarak]]. In contrast to his older brother [[Alaa Mubarak|Alaa]], Gamal had pursued an active public profile and was starting to wield some influence on political life in the country before the [[2011 Egyptian Revolution|revolution]] of early 2011.

Prior to the revolution, Gamal was deputy secretary-general of the then-ruling and now-dissolved [[National Democratic Party (Egypt)|National Democratic Party]], and head of its influential policies committee.

In 2014 and 2015, he was convicted of [[political corruption]] for diverting nearly $20 million in state funds to private use, along with his father and brother, and sentenced to four years in prison.

Within the family, under his half-British mother, his name is 'Jimmy', while his brother Alaa is 'Alan'.&lt;ref&gt;The Family, broadcast by Al Jazeera English, 28 June 2012 ([http://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/2012/06/2012620124818367927.html synopsis])&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and career==
Mubarak's [[given name]], Gamal, comes from Egypt's second president, [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]].&lt;ref name="Salon: Brotherhood should have learnt"/&gt; For his early education, he attended [[St. George's College, Cairo]] before entering the [[American University in Cairo]]. He graduated with a business administration degree and he claims he also earned an [[MBA]] from the university.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} He began his professional career working for [[Bank of America]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=MacFARQUHAR |first1= Neil |author-link1= |last2=ROHDE |first2=David |author-link2= |last3=ROSTON |first3=Aram |date=February 12, 2011 |title=Mubarak Family Riches Attract New Focus |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/13/world/middleeast/13wealth.html? |newspaper=[[New York Times]] |location=[[New York City]] |access-date=2015-01-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Mubarak left Bank of America to set up London-based Medinvest Associates Ltd, which manages a [[private equity fund]], and to do some corporate finance consultancy work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.winne.com/topinterviews/gamal.htm |title=Interview with MR. GAMAL MUBARAK Chairman Of Medinvest Associates Ltd |publisher=Winne.com|date=14 January 1999|accessdate=5 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; His role with Medinvest has since ended.'''{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

In May 2007, Mubarak married Khadiga El Gammal, the daughter of Egyptian construction magnate Mahmoud El Gammal. They have a daughter, Farida (born 2010).{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

== Inheritance of power ==
The grooming of Gamal Mubarak to be his father's successor as the next president of Egypt became increasingly evident at around 2000.&lt;ref&gt;Aziz, Muhammad Abdul and Hussein, Youssef (2002) "The President, the Son, and the Military: Succession in Egypt" ''Arab Studies Journal'' 9/10:&amp;nbsp;pp.&amp;nbsp;73&amp;ndash;88&lt;/ref&gt; With no vice-president, and with no heir-apparent in sight, Gamal started enjoying considerable attention in Egyptian state-run media.&lt;ref&gt;Brownlee, Jason (2008) [https://webspace.utexas.edu/jmb334/www/documents/article.ASJ.2008.pdf "The Heir Apparency of Gamal Mubarak"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120404150833/https://webspace.utexas.edu/jmb334/www/documents/article.ASJ.2008.pdf |date=4 April 2012 }} ''Arab Studies Journal''&amp;nbsp;pp.&amp;nbsp;36&amp;ndash;56&lt;/ref&gt; On 3 February 2000 Hosni Mubarak appointed him to the General Secretariat of the ruling [[National Democratic Party (Egypt)|National Democratic Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Chronology: Egypt|journal=The Middle East Journal|date=Summer 2000|volume=54|issue=3|url=https://www.questia.com/read/1P3-57309062/chronology-egypt|accessdate=3 January 2014}}{{Subscription required|via=Questia}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bashar al-Assad]]'s rise to power in [[Syria]] in June 2000 just hours after [[Hafez al-Assad]]'s death, sparked a heated debate in the Egyptian press regarding the prospects for a similar scenario occurring in Cairo.&lt;ref&gt;Sobelman, Daniel (2001) [http://www.meforum.org/27/gamal-mubarak-president-of-egypt "Gamal Mubarak, President of Egypt?"] ''Middle East Quarterly'' 8(2):&amp;nbsp;pp.&amp;nbsp;31&amp;ndash;40&lt;/ref&gt;

Mubarak founded, and became [[chairman]] of, the [[Future Generation Foundation]] (FGF), an NGO supporting job training but which also served as a vehicle for Mubarak's political career.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.egyptindependent.com/news/book-review-gamals-gang|title=Book review: Gamal's gang - Egypt Independent|date=2011-04-13|work=Egypt Independent|access-date=2017-12-15|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both President Mubarak and his son denied the possibility of any inheritance of power in Egypt. More recently, this claim was made in early 2006, when Gamal Mubarak declared repeatedly that he had no aspiration to succeed his father, but that he would maintain his position in the then-ruling NDP as deputy secretary general, a post he held in addition to heading the party's policy committee, allegedly the most important organ of the NDP.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.middle-east-online.com/english/egypt/?id=16096 http://www.middle-east-online.com/english/egypt/?id=16096] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060418043431/http://www.middle-east-online.com/english/egypt/?id=16096 |date=18 April 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2004, several political groups (most are unofficial), on both the left and the right, announced their sharp opposition to the inheritance of power. They demanded political change and a fair, multi-candidate election.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mengos.net/events/04newsevents/egypt/september/9september04.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040912105629/http://mengos.net/events/04newsevents/egypt/september/9september04.htm |date=12 September 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 February 2005, Mubarak ordered the constitution changed to allow multi-candidate presidential elections before September 2005 by asking parliament to amend Article 76 of the [[Constitution of Egypt|Egyptian constitution]].  This change in the constitution was seen then by some analysts and senior judicial figures as a ploy to seamlessly allow Gamal Mubarak to inherit the top position in Egypt.  According to this view, Gamal Mubarak would be one of the candidates in a presidential elections and would be supported by the ruling party and the government-controlled media. Since remaining serious candidates would be disqualified by the NDP-controlled [[People's Assembly (Egypt)|People's Assembly]] leaving only the less popular candidates, the inheritance of power would be accomplished through a "democratic" process. However these were all merely assumptions made by political activists, analysts, and opponents.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

==End of his father's presidency==
Some political analysts&lt;ref name="mcclatchydc1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mcclatchydc.com/2011/02/13/108650/egypt-insider-mubaraks-fall-was.html|title=Egypt insider: Mubarak's fall was years in the making|publisher=Mc Clatchydc|accessdate=5 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; speculate that the alleged deteriorating state of the Egyptian economy in the last days of [[Hosni Mubarak]]'s rule was caused by Gamal and his friends taking over as political advisers to Mubarak. On the other hand, a wide range of analysts credit Gamal Mubarak for reviving the Egyptian economy over the previous five years, from a stagnant, mostly state-run economy to a largely free market system that enjoyed five percent GDP growth.&lt;ref name="mcclatchydc1"/&gt;

During the first week of the [[2011 Egyptian Revolution]] there were unconfirmed reports and speculation that Gamal might have left Egypt during the protests. However, on 3 February 2011, Gamal was present for an ABC News interview of his father in Cairo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/International/egypt-abc-news-christiane-amanpour-exclusive-interview-president/story?id=12833673|title=Feb. 3, 2011: Amanpour's Exclusive Mubarak Interview|first=A. B. C.|last=News|date=19 June 2012|website=ABC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the [[2011 Egyptian revolution]] unfolded, newly appointed vice president [[Omar Suleiman]] met a major public concern when he announced on 3 February 2011 that Gamal Mubarak would not seek election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-egypt-suleiman-idUKTRE70S2JL20110129|title=Factbox - Omar Suleiman, new Egyptian vice-president|date=29 January 2017|publisher=|via=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reuters Africa reported that a fight took place between him and his older brother, Alaa Mubarak. Alaa supposedly accused Gamal of ruining their father's last days in power and humiliating him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://af.reuters.com/article/egyptNews/idAFLDE71C0HQ20110213|title=Sons of Egypt's Mubarak nearly came to blows-paper|publisher=Reuters|date=13 February 2011|accessdate=5 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political corruption convictions==
Following the stepping down of Hosni Mubarak, media sources started to point to the 'suspicious' financial dealings of Gamal Mubarak. On 28 February 2011, the Egyptian daily ''[[Al-Ahram]]'' published a list of bank accounts allegedly belonging to Gamal Mubarak. ''Al-Ahram'' reported that the Chief Prosecutor of Egypt received a report that Gamal Mubarak inexplicably amassed significant sums of money that were deposited in these accounts. This allegation came on background of a decision from the Prosecutor General of Egypt to freeze all bank accounts belonging to the Mubarak family, including Gamal Mubarak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ahram.org.eg/457/2011/02/28/25/64884.aspx |title=حسابات سرية لعائلة مبارك بالبنوك المصرية 147مليون دولار لسوزان و200 مليون لعلاء وجمال |publisher=Ahram |date=28 February 2011 |accessdate=5 June 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110618162312/http://www.ahram.org.eg/457/2011/02/28/25/64884.aspx |archivedate=18 June 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Egyptian Appeals Court ordered that Mubarak's financial status is reviewed by the court on 5 March 2011. It is expected that the court will render a decision in that hearing whether to uphold the decision to freeze Mubarak's assets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dostor.org/crime/11/february/28/37187 |title=مارس أولى جلسات النظر في تجميد أرصدة مبارك..و26مارس محاكمة رشيد وعز وعسل  الد |publisher=Dostor |date=28 February 2011 |accessdate=6 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110308004312/http://dostor.org/crime/11/february/28/37187 |archivedate=8 March 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 April 2011, Gamal was imprisoned for 15 days pending investigations for corruption, abuse of power, and for his alleged role in causing the fatalities and casualties of peaceful protesters during the revolution which was sparked on 25 January 2011. An official investigation accused Gamal Mubarak of using his influence in the National Democratic Party and as son of the president to award contracts to foreign companies in which he was a partner.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.egyptindependent.com/news/mubarak-brothers-accused-exploiting-influence-gain Mubarak brothers accused of exploiting influence for gain], Egypt Independent, 28 June 2012&lt;/ref&gt; He appeared in court, alongside his father and brother. Gamal, his brother is still currently in prison. Whereas his father has been released from jail but put on house arrest for 15 days.

On 19 December 2013, Gamal was once again freed after he was acquitted of corruption along with his brother and [[Ahmed Shafik]], ex-candidate of [[Egyptian presidential election, 2012]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsdaily.com/world/dee5670b488941222943a3a5096c0c30/egypt-mubaraks-sons-pm-acquitted-of-corruption |title= Egypt: Mubarak's sons, PM acquitted of corruption |publisher=NewsDaily |date=19 December 2013 |accessdate=19 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 May 2014, a Cairo court convicted Mubarak and his sons Alaa and Gamal of [[embezzlement|embezzling]] the equivalent of {{USD|17.6 million}} of state funds intended for renovation of presidential palaces but were instead diverted to upgrade private family homes. The court ordered the repayment of {{USD|17.6 million}}, fined the trio {{USD|2.9 million}}, and sentenced Mubarak to three years in prison and each of his sons to four years. They were retried and convicted again in May 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/09/egypt-hosni-mubarak-sentenced-to-three-years-in-prison|title=Egypt: Hosni Mubarak sentenced to three years in prison|first=Jared|last=Malsin|date=9 May 2015|publisher=|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2015 he and his brother were released from prison, based on time already served.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/12/egypt-court-hosni-mubarak-sons-gamal-alaa-release-corruption-conviction|title=Egypt court orders release of Hosni Mubarak's sons|first=Associated|last=Press|date=12 October 2015|publisher=|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2018, Gamal was arrested along with his brother Alaa and accused of stock market manipulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-45534138|title=Egypt ex-President Mubarak's sons arrested|date=2018-09-15|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-09-17|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Guyanese people''' are people identified with the country of [[Guyana]], which is located on the northern coast of South America and is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean, Brazil, Venezuela and Surinam. Geographically, Guyana is  part of the South American mainland, however it is much more similar to the nearby island nations of the [[Caribbean]] such as [[Trinidad and Tobago]], [[Barbados]], [[Saint Vincent and the Grenadines]] and [[Grenada]] with respect to culture. In fact, Guyana is considered a Caribbean country even though it is not an island nation located in the Caribbean Sea, as are most Caribbean nations.

==Overview==
Guyana is also a founding member of the Caribbean Community [[CARICOM]]; however, it shares some of the Latin American customs and traits that are characteristic of its South American neighbours and is also a founding member of the Union of South American Nations which was formed in 2008. In addition to some Latin American and a great deal of Caribbean influence, Guyana's culture also reflects its European history as it was colonized by both the Dutch and French before becoming a British colony. As a matter of fact, the capital city of the country, Georgetown, was previously called Longchamps and Stabroek under the French and Dutch respectively. Additionally, numerous Guyanese towns and villages have French and Dutch names which reflect the periods during which the country was colonized by the French and Dutch. As would be expected, the pronunciations of the names of those towns and villages are anglicized. Guyana (known as British Guiana under British colonial rule), gained its independence from the United Kingdom in 1966 and subsequently became a republic in 1970. As a result of Guyana's long, 170-year history as a British colony, it is a part of the Anglophone world. Since the country is more culturally Caribbean than it is South American, it is considered to be a part of the Anglephone Caribbean - a subregion of the Caribbean consisting of independent, English-speaking nations that were once British colonies (also known as the Commonwealth Caribbean). Guyana is the only English-speaking country in South America; however, the majority of people in Guyana actually speak Creolese informally. Creolese is a creole language that is largely based on English infrequently interspersed with  anglicized French words. Standard  English, i.e. British English spelling and pronunciation, is used for all business and education and is typically consistently spoken by members of the upper and upper-middle class.

==Demographics==
{{main|Demographics of Guyana}}
Guyana is a diverse nation; 39.8% of the population is of [[Indian people|East Indian]] origin (see [[Indo-Guyanese]]), 30% [[Black African]] (see [[Afro-Guyanese]]), 19.9% [[multiracial]] (almost all part African), 10.5% [[Amerindian]] and 0.5% other, mostly Chinese and whites (most notably Portuguese). The terms «Indo-Guyanese» and «Afro-Guyanese » seem to have only become a part of the Guyanese vernacular within the last 20 years or so. Creolese (Guyanese Creole) is the most common language amongst Guyanese while British English is taught in School, and used in Government and business. Guyanese tend to be quite adept at code-switching, using either Creolese or British English when appropriate. The religious breakdown of Guyanese people is: [[Hindu]] 28.4%, [[Pentecostal]] 16.9%, [[Roman Catholic]] 8.1%, [[Muslim]] 7.2%, [[Anglican]] 6.9%,
[[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventist]] 5%, other [[Christian]] denominations 20.5%, no religion 4.3%, [[Rastafarian]] 0.5%, [[Bahá'í]] 0.1%, other faiths 2.2%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/gy.html |title=The World Factbook |website=Cia.gov |date= |accessdate=2015-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diaspora==
Overseas Guyanese communities mainly exist in the [[United States]] (86,120 Guyanese born), [[United Kingdom]] (20,872 Guyanese born), [[Canada]] (14,560 Guyanese born), and the [[Netherlands]] (328 Guyanese born), although the total populations (i.e. people of Guyanese descent born in that country) are much higher.

The migration of Guyanese to other countries began in the late 1950s when some Guyanese (mainly young men, and some women) took up offers from the British Government to migrate to England to supplement the British labour force, like other Caribbean countries. This was a short lived policy as the British government quickly closed the doors on open immigration from its Caribbean Territories. The migration of many Guyanese Portuguese to the U.K and Canada happened in the late 1960s and early 1970s due to political struggles and problems at the time.

The migration of Guyanese to other Western countries, mostly Canada and the United States, continued throughout the 1970s and 1980s, much of it due to political and economic problems. Discontent with the Forbes Burnham government, misguided economic policies, and shortages of basic items let to large-scale emigration during the 1980s. While many left due to political, economic, and social problems, those who could afford it left looking for better opportunities and some for educational purposes. The 1990s saw migration to other Caribbean countries. Migration continued by the need to reconnect split families. The migration of Guyanese to other lands continues today.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4952">{{About|the author of ''The Land and Government of Muscovy''|the historian and classical scholar|Heinrich von Staden (historian)}}

'''Heinrich von Staden''' (1542–?) was a self-proclaimed "adventurer in Muscovy"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | year = 1984 | title = Modern Encyclopedia of Russian and Soviet History | publisher = [[Academic International Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and wrote of his accounts at the court of Ivan IV (Ivan the Terrible) from 1578-1582.

== Early life ==
Staden was born the son of a burgher (bourgeoisie) in [[Ahlen]], near [[Münster]], Germany. His mother, Kattarina Ossenbach, died in the plague, and he had a brother, Bernhardus von Staden, a [[Roman Catholic]] priest in Ahlen, and a sister. When attending a Catholic [[seminary]] in Ahlen, Staden was accused of stabbing a fellow seminarian with an [[bradawl|awl]]. His cousin, Steffan Hovener, invited him to live in Livonia with him, where "he would not be disturbed." In Livonia, he worked on building the city walls, but didn't like the labor and ran away to the Wolgarten estate in Wolmar, Valmiera. There, the wife of Wolgarten entrusted him with her estates when she learned he could read and write in [[Latin]] and German, and was learning Latvian.

After Wolgarten remarried and moved away, Staden also moved, to Karkus, and became a merchant. After trouble erupted in the Livonian government, Staden sent a letter to his friend, Joachim Schroter at the border town of Dorpat, which was held by the Russians. He wrote that he would serve the Grand Prince [[Ivan IV]] if he were paid. He was invited to Moscow, where he met the Grand Prince. Ivan was impressed with Staden and invited him to dinner; soon after, he became a member of the Tsar's [[political police]], or [[Oprichnina]].

== Living in Russia ==
Staden's account of Russia, ''The Land and Government of Muscovy'', was addressed to the [[Holy Roman Emperor]], [[Rudolf II]]. It consisted of four parts: a petition, a description of Russia, a plan for the invasion of Russia from the north, and the author's autobiography. Staden hoped to influence the emperor to invade Muscovite Russia, restore the region to the [[Teutonic Order]], and be rewarded. The Elector of the Palatinate, Georg Hans Count von Veldenz-Lutzelstein, had similar hopes and took Staden into his employment. Between 1578 and 1582 Staden worked as a sort of spy for the Teutonic Order. He sent his proposal to the [[Grand Masters of the Teutonic Knights|Order's Grand Master]], and later to the Kings of Poland and Sweden.

Historians discovered this document in 1839 in the Prussian state archives, knowing of the count's plans, but no link to Staden was discovered until a few years later. His accounts are the most insightful and descriptive of the day, and displayed the disorder of the Russian government under Ivan the Terrible. Heinrich von Staden calls Tsar Ivan a "horrid tryant",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | year = 1967 | title = The Land and Government of Muscovy: A Sixteenth-Century Account  | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=BoyaAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PP2&amp;lpg=PP2&amp;dq=Heinrich+von+Staden+adventurer+in+Muscovy#v=onepage&amp;q=Heinrich%20von%20Staden%20adventurer%20in%20Muscovy&amp;f=false | publisher = [[Stanford University Press]] | location = [[Stanford, California]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; but wrote more neutrally than his contemporaries. His narratives of the Oprichnina are the only ones written by a member, and the history of the Oprichnina was rewritten after Staden's accounts were found. He describes the targets of Ivan's terror as individual families which the Tsar believed to be dangerous to his authority, rather than against the entire boyar class as previously thought.

== Controversy ==
Some historians question the authenticity of Staden's claims. Academician [[:ru: Веселовский, Степан Борисович|S.B. Veselovsky]] was very critical of the ''Notes on Muscovy''. The historian [[:ru: Альшиц, Даниил Натанович|D.N. Alshits]], comparing Staden's text with the historical realities of the epoch and with the newly discovered documents, came to the conclusion that Staden was not in Oprichnina at all, but only pretended to be oprichnik, in order to raise his status in the eyes of Emperor Rudolph, his patron and addressee of notes on Muscovy.&lt;ref&gt;''Альшиц Д. Н.'' Начало самодержавия в России: Государство Ивана Грозного. — Leningrad: Наука, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Alshits, many of Staden's reports on Ivan the Terrible's Rus resemble the stories of [[Baron Munchausen|Munchausen]].

==Appearances in modern media==
* In [[Pavel Lungin]]'s 2009 film ''[[Tsar (film)|Tsar]]'', Heinrich von Staden is portrayed by [[Finnish people|Finnish]] actor [[Ville Haapasalo]].

'''Hushang Ebtehaj''' ({{lang-fa|هوشنگ ابتهاج}}, with the [[pen name]] of '''H. E. Sayeh''' ({{lang-fa|ه. ا. سایه}}, lit. ''Shade'')  is an eminent Iranian poet of the 20th century, whose life and work spans many of [[Iran]]'s political, cultural and literary upheavals.

==Life==
Ebtehaj was born February 25, 1928 in [[Rasht]], Iran, and had his primary schooling there before moving to [[Tehran]].  His first book of [[poetry]], with an introduction by eminent poet [[Mehdi Hamidi Shirazi]], was published when he was 19 years old. During Iran's open period following World War II, Sayeh got involved in various literary circles and contributed to various literary magazines such as Sokhan, Kavian, Sadaf, Maslehat, and others.  Unlike many other literary figures of the time who got deeply involved in politics and left-leaning activities, Sayeh stayed true to his social and political consciousness but refrained from deeper involvement.  He was employed at the National Cement Company for 22 years while continuing his literary activities.  Later he was invited by the national Iranian Radio to produce the traditional music program "Golhaye Taze" and "Golchin Hafte."

After the 1979 [[Iranian Revolution]] and the ensuing suppression, Sayeh spent a year in prison for his writings.  After his release, he began work on "Hafez, by Sayeh," a verse-for-verse study of the various publications of [[Hafez]].  In 1987, he moved to [[Cologne]], Germany, with his family and lives there.

==Poetry==
&lt;small&gt;Taken from [http://www.daftar-e-honar.org Daftar-e Honar] magazine article by [[Ahmad Karimi-Hakkak]], 1996.&lt;/small&gt;

Sayeh published his first collection of poetry while he was still a high school student in the northern province of [[Gilan]], Iran.  His total output, however, remains small because of his preoccupation with high craftsmanship and exact phraseology.  In the political climate of the 1940s, Sayeh was an ardent advocate of the poetry of social commitment. His own early poetry reveals his concern with purposive literature.

Sayeh has also written a collection of lyrical poems ([[ghazal]]) in the classical style. Here, he reveals an easy mastery of traditional forms—the lyrical ode, in particular—which he uses to celebrate both the sacred and the secular moments of life. Sayeh's poetry, at times highly emotional, is always remarkable for its convincing directness and unconcealed sentiment.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6005">'''Idella Kathleen Hagen''' (November 15, 1945&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130130082930/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/killer_doc_day_break_CdpKfe5dOUaxvkJTxTUzLL ''Killer Doc's B'Day Break'', NY Times article, November 21, 2005, accessed August 4, 2012.]&lt;/ref&gt; – April 18, 2015) was a former [[medical doctor]] who gained notoriety for being accused of [[murder]] by [[asphyxia]] of her parents, Idella Hagen, aged 92, and James Hagen, aged 86, with a plastic bag and a pillow as they slept in their home in [[Chatham Township, New Jersey]], in August 2000. A month earlier, she had returned to her parents' house from her home in the [[Virgin Islands]] because of their age and deteriorating health.  Hagen, a woman of considerable means, &lt;ref name="times1"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A07E7D81131F93BA1575BC0A9669C8B63&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all| title = Parents Dead, Former Doctor Is Now Suspect | work=The New York Times | first=Elissa | last=Gootman | date=2000-08-28 | accessdate=2010-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; had previously cut short a medical career in [[urology]] in 1987 to move to the Virgin Islands to operate an inn with her second husband.&lt;ref name="times1"/&gt;

==Education and professional career==
Raised in Chatham Township, Hagen graduated from [[Chatham High School (New Jersey)|Chatham High School]] in 1963.&lt;ref&gt;Kleinfeld, N. R.; and Peterson, Iver. [https://www.nytimes.com/2000/09/04/nyregion/an-achiever-s-unraveling-fall-of-doctor-accused-of-killing-her-parents.html "An Achiever's Unraveling; Fall of Doctor Accused of Killing Her Parents"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', September 4, 2000. Accessed July 23, 2018. "Dr. Idella Kathleen Hagen liked to be at the center of things, and now she was at the center of an entirely unbidden world.... She graduated from Chatham High School in 1963."&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1973 graduate of the [[Harvard Medical School]], she became the first woman appointed a resident in [[urology]] at the [[Massachusetts General Hospital]] in Boston. She was appointed chief of urology at the [[Rutgers]] Medical School in New Jersey in 1982.&lt;ref name="times1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="times2"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A03E7DB1630F933A0575BC0A9669C8B63&amp;sec=health&amp;pagewanted=print | title = Mental State Is Considered in Dual Killing | work=The New York Times | first=Iver | last=Peterson | accessdate=2010-05-04 | date=2000-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trial==

The defense argued for an [[Insanity defence|insanity plea]]. A defense [[psychiatrist]], Robert L. Sadoff, stated that soon after Hagen returned to her home on Fairmount Avenue, Chatham New Jersey. She had chronic [[Major depressive disorder|depression]] deepened because of the two failed marriages, the loss of her medical career, her fears about her parents' health, and her own fears that her depression would lead to institutionalization.&lt;ref name="times3"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?sec=health&amp;res=9C03E7DE173DF932A35751C0A9649C8B63 | title = Doctor Who Killed Parents Is Found Insane, Not Guilty | work=The New York Times | first=Robert | last=Hanley | date=2002-02-01 | accessdate=2010-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both Sadoff and Dr. [[Steven Simring]], who testified for the prosecution, said Hagen's depression deepened significantly in August 2000, to the point where she thought she was receiving messages from televisions ads, traffic lights and playing cards. They both also said she also heard a male voice she took to be her father's commanding her to commit the murders, because once they occurred, she and her parents would go to what Simring called a "childlike, magical sphere where they'd regain their happiness."&lt;ref name="times3"/&gt;

Deborah Factor, an assistant [[Morris County, New Jersey|Morris County]] prosecutor, asked the psychiatrists if they considered the [[patricide]]-[[matricide]] acts of vindictiveness or [[Coup de grâce|mercy killings]], and they both answered no.&lt;ref name="times3"/&gt;

==Acquittal and confinement==

A New Jersey judge acquitted Hagen of charges after two psychiatrists testified that she was [[Psychosis|psychotic]] at the time.&lt;ref name="times3"/&gt;

After the psychiatrists agreed that Hagen had been depressed for years, was delusional during the murders and was now suicidal, Judge B. Theodore Bozonelis found her not guilty on grounds of insanity and committed her to a state mental health institution.&lt;ref name="times3"/&gt;

Judge Bozonelis did not order a specific term of confinement, but said he believed that she required long-term treatment in an institution because she is prone to unpredictable bouts of psychosis and is a danger to herself and society. Under the law, he said, Hagen was entitled to periodic hearings and reviews about her recovery and continued confinement.&lt;ref name="times3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="starledger"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.funtrivia.com/ubbthreads/showthreaded.php?Cat=0&amp;Number=578113&amp;an=&amp;page=0&amp;vc=1 | title=Doctor who killed parents seeks release from hospital }}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==

Hagen died, aged 69, on April 18, 2015, at her home. She was cremated.&lt;ref name="Horizon Funeral Services"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://horizonfuneralservices.com/obituary/136640/Idella-Hagen-of-Monmouth-Beach-New-Jersey/ |title = Idella's Obituary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The {{nihongo|'''jinmeiyō kanji'''|人名用漢字||lit. ''Chinese characters for use in personal names''}} are a set of 863 [[Chinese character]]s known as "name kanji" in [[English Language|English]]. They are a supplementary list of [[character (computing)|characters]] that can legally be used in registered personal names in Japan, despite not being in the official list of "commonly used characters" ([[jōyō kanji]]). "Jinmeiyō kanji" is sometimes used to refer to the characters in both the jinmeiyō and jōyō lists.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

A [[ministerial decree]] of 1946 limited the number of officially sanctioned [[kanji]] for public use to the 1850 [[tōyō kanji]]. Only kanji on this list were acceptable as registered names, despite the fact that the list excluded many kanji frequently used in names up to that point. However, on May 25, 1951, the cabinet extended the set of characters usable in names by specifying the first 90 jinmeiyō kanji.

Over the years, the Minister of Justice has increased the number of name kanji, and has a plan for further addition in response to requests from parents. As of April 30, 2009, there were 985 jinmeiyō kanji, but this number was reduced to 861 in late 2010 when 129 jinmeiyō characters were transferred to the jōyō kanji list, and 5 characters were transferred from the jōyō kanji list to jinmeiyō characters. In 2015 and 2017, 2 kanji in total were added to the jinmeiyō list, making the total number 863.

In [[Japan]], name kanji are taught at the junior-high level, and mastery of the name kanji is required to achieve Level 2 of the [[Kanji kentei]], a Chinese-character proficiency test.

==History==
Below is a list of changes made to the jinmeiyō kanji list since its creation in 1951.

===May 25, 1951===
First 92 characters of jinmeiyō kanji were published:

{{lang|ja|丑 丞 乃 之 也 亘 亥 亦 亨 亮 伊 匡 卯 只 吾 呂 哉 嘉 圭 奈 宏 寅 巌 巳 庄 弘 弥 彦 悌 敦 昌 晃 晋 智 暢 朋 桂 桐 楠 橘 欣 欽 毅 浩 淳 熊 爾 猪 玲 琢 瑞 睦 磯 祐 禄 禎 稔 穣 綾 惣 聡 肇 胤 艶 蔦 藤 蘭 虎 蝶 輔 辰 郁 酉 錦 鎌 靖 須 馨 駒 鯉 鯛 鶴 鹿 麿 亀}}

Seven of them were later transferred to the [[jōyō kanji]]: {{lang|ja|仙 尚 杉 甚 磨 斉 龍}}, the last one {{lang|ja|龍}} being [[shinjitai|simplified]] to {{lang|ja|竜}} (dragon).

===July 30, 1976===
28 [[kanji]] were added, for a total of 120 characters.

{{lang|ja|佑 允 冴 喬 怜 旭 杏 梓 梢 梨 沙 渚 瑠 瞳 紗 紘 絢 翠 耶 芙 茜 藍 那 阿 隼 鮎 葵}}

One was later transferred to the [[jōyō kanji]]: {{lang|ja|悠}}.

===October 1, 1981===
Introduction of the [[jōyō kanji]] list, which includes the 8 characters mentioned above; those 8 are thus deleted from the jinmeyō kanji list.
54 other characters are added for a total of 166 name characters.

{{lang|ja|伍 伶 侑 尭 孟 峻 嵩 嶺 巴 彬 惇 惟 慧 斐 旦 昂 李 栗 楓 槙 汐 洵 洸 渥 瑛 瑶 璃 甫 皓 眸 矩 碧 笹 緋 翔 脩 苑 茉 莉 萌 萩 蓉 蕗 虹 諒 赳 迪 遥 遼 霞 頌 駿 鳩 鷹}}

===March 1, 1990===
118 [[kanji]] were added for a total of 284 characters.

{{lang|ja|伎 伽 侃 倖 倭 偲 冶 凌 凜 凪 捺 於 旺 昴 晏 晟 晨 暉 曙 朔 凱 勁 叡 叶 唄 啄 奎 媛 嬉 宥 崚 嵐 嵯 巽 彗 彪 恕 憧 拳 捷 杜 柊 柚 柾 栞 梧 椋 椎 椰 椿 楊 榛 槻 樺 檀 毬 汀 汰 洲 湧 滉 漱 澪 熙 燎 燦 燿 爽 玖 琳 瑚 瑳 皐 眉 瞭 碩 秦 稀 稜 竣 笙 紬 絃 綜 綸 綺 耀 胡 舜 芹 茄 茅 莞 菖 菫 蒔 蒼 蓮 蕉 衿 袈 裟 詢 誼 諄 邑 醇 采 雛 鞠 颯 魁 鳳 鴻 鵬 麟 黎 黛}}

===December 3, 1997===
1 [[kanji]] was added, for a total of 285 characters.

{{lang|ja|琉}}

===February 23, 2004===
1 [[kanji]] was added, for a total of 286 characters.

{{lang|ja|曽}}

===June 7, 2004===
1 [[kanji]] was added, for a total of 287 characters.

{{lang|ja|獅}}

===June 11, 2004===
No addition to the jinmeiyō kanji was made on this date. However, a plan for 578 additions was put forward to the council on jinmeiyō kanji of the legislative council of the Ministry of Justice. The list included certain characters in strong demand by parents for use in their children's names, such as:
* {{lang|ja|苺}} (''ichigo'', "strawberry")
* {{lang|ja|遙}} (''haruka'', "distant", [[kyūjitai|traditional variant]])
* {{lang|ja|煌}} (''akira'', "scintillating")
* {{lang|ja|牙}} (''kiba'', "fang")

Many others were included not for their potential uses in names (as is noted), but rather because of their frequent use and being easy to read and write. Examples include:

* {{lang|ja|糞}} (''kuso'', "excrement")
* {{lang|ja|呪}} (''noroi'', "curse")
* {{lang|ja|屍}} (''shikabane'', "corpse")
* {{lang|ja|癌}} (''gan'',  "cancer")

At this same council, the decision was made to call for suggestions on characters to be included or excluded via the Ministry of Justice website, until July 9, 2004.

===July 12, 2004===
3 [[kanji]] were added, for a total of 290 characters.

{{lang|ja|毘 瀧 駕}}

===July 23, 2004===
No additions were made. After sharp protests, the council decided to withdraw nine characters from the 489 whose inclusion had been discussed. These nine characters were:
* {{lang|ja|糞}} (''kuso'', "excrement")
* {{lang|ja|呪}} (''noroi'', "curse")
* {{lang|ja|屍}} (''shikabane'', "corpse")
* {{lang|ja|癌}} (''gan'',  "cancer")
* {{lang|ja|姦}} (''kashimashii'', "rape, seduction")
* {{lang|ja|淫}} (''midara'', "obscene")
* {{lang|ja|怨}} (''urami'', "resentment")
* {{lang|ja|痔}} (''ji'', "hemorrhoids")
* {{lang|ja|妾}} (''mekake'',  "concubine")

The 480 other characters still remained under consideration for inclusion, with one additional character added to them, namely {{lang|ja|掬}} (''kiku'', "to draw up water with one's hands").

===September 27, 2004===
484 characters and variant forms of 209 [[jōyō kanji]] were added, bringing the total number of the jinmeiyō kanji to 983.

===April 30, 2009===
2 more characters for a total number of 985 characters.

{{lang|ja|祷 穹}}

===November 30, 2010===
In late 2010, the Japanese government added 196 characters to the [[jōyō kanji]] list. The list now includes 129 characters previously classified as jinmeiyō kanji, 11 of which are currently used in Japanese prefectures or nearby countries:&lt;ref name=asahi&gt;Akihiko Shiraishi, {{lang|ja|[http://www.asahi.com/national/update/1023/TKY200910230335.html 「柿」など９字追加、「鷹」は選外　新常用漢字の修正案]}} ("New draft table adds 196 everyday-use kanji") in ''Asahi Shimbun'', 23 October 2009, retrieved 25 October 2009.

==Education==

===High school===
In the United States, the [[Education in the United States#School grades|11th grade]] is usually the third year of a student's high school period and is referred to as junior year.

===College===
In the U.S., colleges generally require students to declare an [[academic major]] by the beginning of their junior year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In the UK, any child in key stage 2 (Year 3 – Year 6) is known as a junior, having developed from previously being infants. At the end of Year 6 (usually age 11), they leave primary school and go to secondary school&amp;nbsp;— the transition from Junior to Senior (unless they live in an area with a middle school system).

==Character outline==
[[Image:Codegeass0309LG-1-.jpg|thumb|left|Frail and meek, this aspect of Kallen's character was used as a public front to mask her true nature as a combatant deeply involved in the resistance.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}]]
Kallen Stadtfeld is half-Britannian, half-Japanese, but believes herself to be a Japanese person at heart and prefers to be known by her mother's maiden name, Kouzuki. Her father is Britannian and her mother is an Eleven; her father comes from a prestigious Britannian family, which Kallen benefits from. She attends the Ashford Academy, where she later becomes a member of its student council and is one of its most outstanding students. Her brother, {{nihongo|Naoto Kouzuki|紅月ナオト|Kōzuki Naoto}}, with whom she had a deep connection, was a former leader of her resistance cell before his death.

Both Kallen's [[stepmother]], a Britannian, and biological mother live with her in the same house, but her biological mother is employed as a maid and is often mistreated by both her stepmother and Kallen herself. After her biological mother is arrested for using Refrain (a fictional drug which lets people think they're reliving the past), Kallen changes her views and decides to fight against the Britannian Empire not only for her brother, but to fulfill her new wish for a world in which she can live happily with her biological mother.

Kallen leads a double life as a normal Britannian student and as a member of a guerrilla resistance group against Britannia, which is later reformed into the Order of the Black Knights by [[Lelouch Lamperouge]]. In school, she portrays herself as a weak-bodied high school student who obeys all of the formalities, and goes by her Britannian name of Stadtfeld. However, her personality changes into a very strong-willed and forceful one when she acts as a resistance fighter.

As a running gag, Kallen ends up nude or immodestly dressed in front of other people on numerous occasions: Lelouch sees her naked after she accidentally pulls back a shower curtain in the third episode, Suzaku sees her bathing under a waterfall when they are stranded on Kamine Island, she is forced to dress in an immodest bunny costume at the start of the second season (to plant a tracking device on Lelouch), and she walks in on a meeting between C.C. and the Chinese ambassadors wearing only a towel when intending to complain about the previous situation to C.C. (claiming that the operation would've gone faster if C.C. was wearing the outfit).

In an interview reported by the anime magazine [[Newtype USA]], seiyu Ami Koshimizu talked about the difficulty of voicing Kallen because of the double life that her character leads. Certain aspects of Kallen's character such as her girlish naivete and competitiveness made it easy for the voice actress to relate, even to the point of admitting that in some ways they act very much the same.&lt;ref name = "NewI"&gt;{{cite magazine |title=Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion |magazine=Newtype USA |volume=6 |issue=12 |pages=32–33 |date=December 2007 |issn=1541-4817 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Character history==
===First season===
Kallen appears early in the first episode, driving a truck with [[C.C. (Code Geass)|C.C.]]'s capsule, and then providing cover by fighting Jeremiah in a ''Glasgow''. After Lelouch gains his Geass from C.C., he takes control of an enemy [[Knightmare Frame#Sutherland|''Sutherland'']] and helps Kallen to escape the other [[Knightmare Frame]]s chasing her. He further directs the remaining resistance forces in the battle, granting them a decisive advantage until [[Suzaku Kururugi]] uses the [[Knightmare Frame#Lancelot|''Lancelot'']]'s superior systems to overwhelm their forces. She sacrifices her own machine to allow Lelouch to escape, despite not knowing who he really is.

After this incident, Lelouch's unfamiliarity with his Geass causes him to reveal knowledge of the Shinjuku incident to Kallen while questioning her about her motivations, leading her to suspect him of being their unknown benefactor. Lelouch disproves these suspicions by being present while she receives a telephone call from [[Lelouch Lamperouge#Zero|Zero]], which actually plays a message he recorded. With the formation of the Black Knights and Zero's increasing number of victories over the Britannian forces, Kallen comes to greatly admire him, evident in her ecstatic reaction to her appointment as head of his personal guard. She even tries to assassinate Suzaku Kururugi after learning that he is the pilot of the ''Lancelot'', believing it would benefit Zero's goal. The trust seems to be mutual, as Lelouch offers to reveal his identity to her when he notices her curiosity; she declines, though she shows signs of jealousy that C.C., whom she had first met in the previous episode, appears to know.

[[Image:CLMarkII.jpg|thumb|The ''Guren'' Mk-II]]
Once the Black Knights begin receiving new Knightmares, Zero gives Kallen the newly developed [[Knightmare Frame#Guren Mk-II|''Guren'' Mk-II]]. With its powerful radiation-emitting arm and speed matching that of Suzaku's ''Lancelot'', Kallen becomes one of the Black Knights' most talented pilots, often facing off against Suzaku and usually proving an even match for him.

At the end of the first season, Kallen reveals her identity to the students of Ashford Academy when the Black Knights occupy it as their base of operations, convincing the student council that they will not be harmed. Later on, she battles against Suzaku in his flight-equipped ''Lancelot'', suffering a narrow defeat. Lelouch intervenes before Suzaku can deliver the finishing blow. When Lelouch abandons the battle to rescue his sister, Kallen follows him. She witnesses his confrontation with Suzaku and learns about his true identity, the truth about the massacre of SAZ, and his Geass power. She flees in shock rather than helping Lelouch to deal with Suzaku, and goes into hiding. In ''Oz the Reflection'', she briefly helps Orpheus Zevon in battle before rejoining the Black Knights.

===Second season (R2)===
One year later, Kallen is still part of the Black Knights. Along with C.C., she is the only member who knows Lelouch's identity and secret power, having been brought up to speed by C.C. in the interim. Kallen confronts Lelouch about whether or not he used Geass to make her loyal to him, and Lelouch insists that her loyalty is her own decision. She seems to accept this, and still supports Zero, even though she prefers to see Lelouch and Zero as separate entities; however, she later starts seeing them as the same person. Over time Kallen grows to love Lelouch, offering to die for him. She also desires to be in his inner circle as C.C. is, so that she won't be left in the dark about his plans; though she won't admit it, C.C. easily sees through the act and playfully teases her about it, with Kallen unaware that Lelouch is slowly returning her feelings.

During the operation to kidnap [[Nunnally vi Britannia]] as she is being transported to Area 11, Kallen receives an upgrade for the ''Guren'' Mk-II, giving it flight capabilities and an upgraded radiation arm. With it she is able to destroy [[Gilbert G.P. Guilford]]'s [[Knightmare Frame#Vincent|''Vincent'']] and the remaining two [[List of Code Geass characters#Glaston Knights|Glaston Knights]] flanking him, then incapacitate Gino and Anya's Knightmare Frames with a wide-range burst. Her battle with Suzaku is cut short when the airship carrying Nunnally crashes into the sea.

After this incident, Lelouch becomes depressed over Nunnally's involvement, since he can't bring himself to go against her wishes. When he nearly resorts to taking Refrain, Kallen steps in and talks him out of it, promising to do anything he asks her to. He tries to kiss her, requesting her to comfort him as a woman, but despite her feelings for him she backs out at the last moment and slaps him, insisting that he bears the responsibility for realizing the dream he gave the Japanese people. After Lelouch regains his composure and tricks the Britannians into exiling the Black Knights, she shows a great deal of relief knowing that he's feeling better. While she is daydreaming about this, Lelouch snaps her back to reality, causing her to fall on him. As she tries to cherish the moment by asking him why he came back, he counter-asks her if she will return to Ashford with him when Britannia is defeated, only to be interrupted by C.C.

During the Black Knights attempted kidnapping of [[List of Code Geass characters#Tianzi|Empress Tianzi]], Kallen is captured by [[Li Xingke]] in his ''[[Knightmare Frame#Shen Hu|Shen Hu]]'', having taken her ''Guren'' into battle without replacing its energy filler. After the High Eunuchs turn to [[Schneizel el Britannia]] for military support, she is turned over to Suzaku along with the ''Guren''. She is sent back to a prison in Area 11, and subsequently transferred into a more comfortable solitary cell by Nunnally, who also gives her a dress to wear. Suzaku approaches her after Shirley's death, intending to use the Refrain drug to find out if Lelouch has become Zero once again, but cannot bring himself to do it because he refuses to stoop to Lelouch's level. In retaliation, she beats him severely during their next meeting when Suzaku tries to apologize.

[[Image:Guren S.E.I.T.E.N. Eight Elements-Type.jpg|thumb|200px|The ''Guren S.E.I.T.E.N.'' Eight Elements-Type]]
During the second battle of Tokyo, Kallen is rescued from captivity and returned to the ''Guren'' (complete with a pilot suit brought by [[List of Code Geass characters#Sayoko Shinozaki|Sayoko]]), which had been radically upgraded by [[Lloyd Asplund]] and [[Cécile Croomy]] during her imprisonment. Using the new ''Guren'', she annihilates the Britannian forces. [[List of Code Geass characters#Luciano Bradley|Luciano Bradley]] and the Valkyrie squadron are killed, as are an untold number of support units. She then fights Suzaku, easily breaking through his defenses and bringing him to the brink of death. In doing so, however, she activates his Geass command, forcing him to survive by firing the ''F.L.E.I.J.A.'' bomb. She dodges it and the bomb hits the government building, destroying a fair portion of the Tokyo Settlement.

After Kallen returns to the Black Knights, she learns of C.C.'s memory loss and realizes that Lelouch is alone. When Zero's identity is revealed, she tries to defend him. The others won't listen, suspecting that Lelouch is controlling her. She asks Lelouch what she means to him, expressing a willingness to die with him. Seeing no way out, Lelouch mocks the Black Knights for taking so long to realize the truth, then calls Kallen a pawn. As Kallen walks away feeling betrayed, he whispers "Kallen, you must live on" within earshot. She unsuccessfully tries to get the Black Knights to wait after their first attempt to kill Zero fails thanks to [[Rolo Lamperouge]], and is left standing on the [[hangar]] floor when Rolo uses his Geass to escape with Lelouch. After Lelouch's escape, Kallen tries to protest how Ohgi and the others have discarded Zero so readily despite all that he has done for them, but they refuse to listen, still angered at the idea that they were merely being used as pawns. When Lelouch is crowned Emperor, Kallen and the rest of the Black Knights are visibly stunned.

Following Lelouch's declaration that Britannia will join the U.F.N., Kallen escorts him to the meeting, giving orders to the Black Knights beforehand to gun her down if she appears to be under the influence of Geass. Lelouch gets her to take the long route, giving them the chance to speak in private. Kallen recounts their history, and then asks Lelouch what he intends to gain by becoming Emperor, as well as what she means to him. Lelouch remains silent, so she kisses him. When he still doesn't respond, she bids him farewell; he does the same once she can no longer hear him.

When Lelouch takes the U.F.N. leaders hostage, Kallen insists that she'll take Lelouch down personally, as she possesses the only Knightmare capable of fighting Suzaku's ''Lancelot Albion''. However, Xingke orders her not to fight, fearing for the safety of the hostages. After the Black Knights side with Schneizel, Kallen is stationed in the front lines. She breaks away from the main line to try to reach Lelouch, but is called back. Kallen breaks into the ''Avalon'' and attempts to kill Lelouch, with tears in her eyes as she does so, but is stopped by C.C. Kallen defeats C.C. and, with the help of Gino, proceeds to the ''Damocles'' for a final confrontation with Suzaku.

After a fierce battle, Kallen manages to land a decisive blow on the ''Lancelot''; however, this is at the cost of having her ''Guren'' completely disabled in the process and losing consciousness. While the ''Lancelot'' explodes, she falls from the floating fortress to what would have been her death had it not been for Gino's rescue. After the battle, she is taken along with many others who rebelled against Lelouch to execution, and then witnesses Lelouch's death by Suzaku disguised as Zero. She immediately understands what Lelouch has done, and stoutly proclaims that it is the real Zero with tears in her eyes.

In the two months following Lelouch's death, Kallen has forgiven Lelouch since she realized his intention—to sacrifice himself and through it to expunge the hatred of the world. She narrates about the changed world he created. She is shown living with her mother in the city. She still attends Ashford Academy and is one of the members of Rivalz's new Student Council, but has thrown away her frail cover, signified by her going to school with her preferred hairstyle and the ''Guren''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s key around her neck. She keeps several photos of her friends in her room and smiles at the one with Lelouch before eating a piece of French toast, waving goodbye to her mother before hurrying to school.

Kallen's character poem in the Code Geass DVD reveals that she had fallen in love with Lelouch through her devotion to him and that if he had ever told her that he loved her again, she would've "followed him to hell". Knowing that she would do precisely that was the reason Lelouch remained silent, as had they consummated their feelings, she would have found out about the Zero Requiem, subsequently trying to talk him out of it and, if that didn't work, commit suicide, he wanted Kallen to live on. She then declares that it wasn't just because of that she fell in love with him, but also due to the noble actions she had always supported and revealed to her by Nunnally. Four months later, she is present for Lelouch's miracle over the Student Council, where he asks her to never give up on them and thanking her for staying in school; when he departs, she grimaces over the fact she will never stop loving him.

==Abilities==
Kallen is a highly skilled Knightmare Frame pilot, rivaling the abilities of even the Knights of the Round. She is acknowledged as the best pilot of the Black Knights by enemies and allies alike. Her codename, "Q-1," is the [[Queen (chess)|Queen]]'s starting spot in [[descriptive chess notation]]. In Lelouch's assessment of the core members of the Black Knights, her "Combat Ability" score is 100 out of 100, matching that of [[List of Code Geass characters#Kyoshiro Tohdoh|Kyoshiro Tohdoh]]; she also has the highest possible "Loyalty" score of 100.&lt;ref name="rating"&gt;{{cite episode|title=The Assassin from the Past|series=Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion R2|network=[[Mainichi Broadcasting System]]|airdate=2008-07-06|number=13|minutes=4:12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even when piloting outdated Knightmare Frames such as the [[Knightmare Frames#Glasgow|''Glasgow'']], Kallen proves to be a dangerous opponent easily defeating numerous ''Sutherlands'', despite the ''Sutherland'' being a more advanced Knightmare. With the radiation arm of her ''Guren'' Mk-II, Kallen can take down almost any Knightmare Frame in a single attack should they allow her to make physical contact, and later models also have numerous secondary attack modes for mid- and long-range combat. Her Knightmare Frame is also incredibly fast, allowing her to fight on the same level as some of the most advanced Knightmare Frames in the series.

Outside of a Knightmare, Kallen displays superior fighting abilities. She is nimble enough to swat a bee with a single swipe (and cut it in thirds), and on two occasions she defeats numerous armed men with little trouble. She is also apparently intelligent, since her grades in school are top of the class despite frequent absences.

In the video game spin-off ''[[Code Geass: Lost Colors]]'', Kallen was one of the characters Rai meets, along with the other student council members, and greeted him after he wakes up. If the player chooses either Black Knight route or Blue Moon route, Rai becomes Kallen's love interest as their relationship developed and attempts to be close to him, while the player interacts more with Kallen if the player progresses a relationship with her in the Blue Moon route.

At day 1 to 5, Kallen arrived at the school and meets Rai at the courtyard, leading the two to have a friendly interaction with each other and eventually causing all the male students around them to develop a killing intent on Rai.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://code-geass-lost-colors-translation.yolasite.com/loc-courtyard.php|title=Code Geass: Lost Colors Translation|author=|date=|website=code-geass-lost-colors-translation.yolasite.com|accessdate=30 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://code-geass-lost-colors-translation.yolasite.com/resources/Lost%20Colors,%20(Ashford)%20Courtyard,%20(1)%20Kallen%20and%20Rivalz%20(ScAsh-中庭-Ka-Ri-01).doc Code Geass: Lost Colors&gt;Day 1 to 5&gt;Morning&gt;Ashford scene: Courtyard]&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Black Knight Route''====
In her first day, since Rai's arrival at Ashford Academy, Kallen arrived at Rai's place to lead him to the student council room by Milly.

When the student council members notice Rai being lively, they suspect Kallen may have influence him as they've been seen together lately and suspected having a relationship with him, which Kallen denied and ask Rai to clear up the misunderstanding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://code-geass-lost-colors-translation.yolasite.com/resources/Lost%20Colors,%20(Automatic)%20(After%203)%20Number-19%20(ScAutomatic-19)%20(Choice).doc|title=Code Geass: Lost Colors&gt;Day 4 and onwards&gt;After 2nd Midday&gt;Automatic scene: 19|author=|date=|publisher=|accessdate=30 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the player choose to confirm Kallen's words, she becomes satisfied and the student council members sees them on good terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://code-geass-lost-colors-translation.yolasite.com/resources/Lost%20Colors%20(Choices),%20(Automatic)%20(After%203)%20Number-19%20(ScAutomatic-19),%20Triangle.doc|title=Code Geass: Lost Colors&gt;Day 4 and onwards&gt;After 2nd Midday&gt;Automatic scene: 19&gt;Choice: Triangle|author=|date=|publisher=|accessdate=30 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the player choose to confirm the student council's word, Kallen becomes shocked and embarrassed and the student council members becomes surprised and cheerful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://code-geass-lost-colors-translation.yolasite.com/resources/Lost%20Colors%20(Choices),%20(Automatic)%20(After%203)%20Number-19%20(ScAutomatic-19),%20X.doc|title=Code Geass: Lost Colors&gt;Day 4 and onwards&gt;After 2nd Midday&gt;Automatic scene: 19&gt;Choice: X|author=|date=|publisher=|accessdate=30 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the two left, they decided to go to Shinjuku Ghetto, to search for a clue on Rai's identity.

While searching through the ghetto, Kallen notice Rai recognizing a building and suspect Rai was Japanese, then notice Kallen's face brightened up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://code-geass-lost-colors-translation.yolasite.com/resources/Lost%20Colors,%20(Automatic)%20(After%20Auto-19,%201%20to%203)%20Number-20%20(ScAutomatic-20)%20(2%20Choices)%20(Knightmare%20Battle).doc|title=Code Geass: Lost Colors&gt;Day 5 and onwards&gt;Morning after Auto-19&gt;Automatic scene: 20|author=|date=|publisher=|accessdate=30 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the player chooses to say if she laughed at him, Kallen denies it and decides to look around more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://code-geass-lost-colors-translation.yolasite.com/resources/Lost%20Colors%20(Choices),%20(Automatic)%20(After%20Auto-19,%201%20to%203)%20Number-20%20(ScAutomatic-20),%201st%20Choice,%20Triangle%20(Knightmare%20Battle).doc|title=Code Geass: Lost Colors&gt;Day 5 and onwards&gt;Morning after Auto-19&gt;Automatic scene: 20&gt;Choice 1: Triangle|author=|date=|publisher=|accessdate=30 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the player choose to say if she's happy, Kallen replied that he had remembered something since she's been keeping him company, which Rai thanked her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://code-geass-lost-colors-translation.yolasite.com/resources/Lost%20Colors%20(Choices),%20(Automatic)%20(After%20Auto-19,%201%20to%203)%20Number-20%20(ScAutomatic-20),%201st%20Choice,%20X%20(Knightmare%20Battle).doc|title=Code Geass: Lost Colors&gt;Day 5 and onwards&gt;Morning after Auto-19&gt;Automatic scene: 20&gt;Choice 1: X|author=|date=|publisher=|accessdate=30 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, the two are caught in a battle by a group of Anti-Britannian terrorists with ''Burai'' Kightmare Frames pretending to be the Black Knights and a group of Britannian ''Sutherlands'' and Knight Police Frames. As they try to escape, they see a ''Burai'' falling onto them. If the player chooses to Protect Kallen, Rai immediately grabs Kallen in between his arms and turned his back towards the ''Burai''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://code-geass-lost-colors-translation.yolasite.com/resources/Lost%20Colors%20(Choices),%20(Automatic)%20(After%20Auto-19,%201%20to%203)%20Number-20%20(ScAutomatic-20),%202nd%20Choice,%20Triangle%20(Knightmare%20Battle).doc|title=Code Geass: Lost Colors&gt;Day 5 and onwards&gt;Morning after Auto-19&gt;Automatic scene: 20&gt;Choice 2: Triangle|author=|date=|publisher=|accessdate=30 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the player chooses to thrust Kallen away, Rai lied face down on the ground, knocking Kallen to the ground as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://code-geass-lost-colors-translation.yolasite.com/resources/Lost%20Colors%20(Choices),%20(Automatic)%20(After%20Auto-19,%201%20to%203)%20Number-20%20(ScAutomatic-20),%202nd%20Choice,%20X%20(Knightmare%20Battle).doc|title=Code Geass: Lost Colors&gt;Day 5 and onwards&gt;Morning after Auto-19&gt;Automatic scene: 20&gt;Choice 2: X|author=|date=|publisher=|accessdate=30 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two later went in the damaged ''Burai'', with Rai piloting it visually as the hatch can’t close while Kallen wrapped around his body and tried to escape, but later encountered a Sutherland who was targeting the ''Burai'' and started to attack. However Rai managed to defeat him easily, which led Kallen to become surprised and impressed. They later encountered the real Black Knights defeating both the terrorists and the Britannian army while they were helping the civilians escape, leading Kallen to have them recognize her and let them leave.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://code-geass-lost-colors-translation.yolasite.com/resources/Lost%20Colors%20(Automatic),%20(Knightmare%20Battle)%20During%20Scene-20.doc|title=Code Geass: Lost Colors&gt;Day 5 and onwards&gt;Morning after Auto-19&gt;Automatic scene: 20&gt;Knightmare Battle Scene|author=|date=|publisher=|accessdate=30 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The next day in Ashford Academy, Kallen meets Rai in the courtyard and request she would talk to him in the rooftops involving the battle at Shinjuku. Kallen then asked Rai how he knew to easily pilot a Knightmare, which he replied that he just knew.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://code-geass-lost-colors-translation.yolasite.com/resources/Lost%20Colors,%20(Automatic)%20(Day%20after%20Auto-20,%201)%20Number-21%20(ScAutomatic-21)%20(Choice).doc|title=Code Geass: Lost Colors&gt;Day 6 and onwards&gt;Day after Auto-20&gt;Automatic scene: 21|author=|date=|publisher=|accessdate=30 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the player choose to say if he was a Britannian who was in the army before, Kallen thinks of it as a possibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://code-geass-lost-colors-translation.yolasite.com/resources/Lost%20Colors%20(Choices),%20(Automatic)%20(Day%20after%20Auto-20,%201)%20Number-21%20(ScAutomatic-21),%20Triangle.doc|title=Code Geass: Lost Colors&gt;Day 6 and onwards&gt;Day after Auto-20&gt;Automatic scene: 21&gt; Choice: Triangle|author=|date=|publisher=|accessdate=30 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the player choose to say what Kallen thinks, she replied the possibility of Rai being a soldier of a Japanese resistance cell, which Rai thinks of himself as a dangerous person, but Kallen comments that he should be happy about the clues of his identity increased.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://code-geass-lost-colors-translation.yolasite.com/resources/Lost%20Colors%20(Choices),%20(Automatic)%20(Day%20after%20Auto-20,%201)%20Number-21%20(ScAutomatic-21),%20X.doc|title=Code Geass: Lost Colors&gt;Day 6 and onwards&gt;Day after Auto-20&gt;Automatic scene: 21&gt; Choice: X|author=|date=|publisher=|accessdate=30 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; During lunch break after their discussion, both Kallen and Rai went to the cafeteria together, which cause the attention to the other students there, which both don't know why. Later Rivalz appeared with Lelouch and has teased them for the two being a couple after a rumor mentioning her relationship with Rai went well and the incident involving the two in the Shinjuku ghetto, which includes Rai protecting Kallen. The rumor has shocked Kallen and Rai, with Lelouch thanked Rai for his deed and Rivalz curious to know what. Although Kallen had confirmed that Rai had saved her, she was annoyed by Rivalz's constant bickering, which led to Lelouch convincing him not to bother her more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://code-geass-lost-colors-translation.yolasite.com/resources/Lost%20Colors,%20(Automatic)%20(After%20Auto-21,%202)%20Number-22%20(ScAutomatic-22).doc|title=Code Geass: Lost Colors&gt;Day 6 and onwards&gt;After Auto-21, 1st Midday&gt;Automatic scene: 22|author=|date=|publisher=|accessdate=30 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kallen later went to the Black Knight's hideout and meets with Zero to report about what happened in Shinjuku ghetto and revealed to him about Rai and his piloting skills. This report got Zero interested and was recommended by Kallen that he would join the Black Knights.

The next day, Kallen waited for Rai at the Ghetto Ruins, witnessed his arrival and revealed her true self to him, which slightly surprised Rai. Kallen then led Rai to an Underground Tunnel and requested him to join her to fight against Britannia, believing him to be Japanese, which has confused Rai. The two arrived at an Abandoned Building and Kallen introduces him to Zero and revealed herself as Kallen Kouzuki, a member of the Black Knights. Kallen also requested Rai to join them, and requested to Zero for his admission, which Zero let Rai to decide, but noted they will take measures to protect their secret.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://code-geass-lost-colors-translation.yolasite.com/resources/Lost%20Colors,%20(Automatic)%20(After%203)%20Number-25%20(ScAutomatic-25)%20(Choice).doc|title=Code Geass: Lost Colors&gt;Day 11 and onwards&gt;After 2nd Midday &gt;Automatic scene: 25|author=|date=|publisher=|accessdate=30 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the player chooses to have no choice&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://code-geass-lost-colors-translation.yolasite.com/resources/Lost%20Colors%20(Choices),%20(Automatic)%20(After%203)%20Number-25%20(ScAutomatic-25),%20Triangle.doc|title=Code Geass: Lost Colors&gt;Day 11 and onwards&gt;After 2nd Midday &gt;Automatic scene: 25&gt;Choice: Triangle|author=|date=|publisher=|accessdate=30 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; or accepts to join,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://code-geass-lost-colors-translation.yolasite.com/resources/Lost%20Colors%20(Choices),%20(Automatic)%20(After%203)%20Number-25%20(ScAutomatic-25),%20Square.doc|title=Code Geass: Lost Colors&gt;Day 11 and onwards&gt;After 2nd Midday &gt;Automatic scene: 25&gt;Choice: Square|author=|date=|publisher=|accessdate=30 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kallen becomes pleased. However, if the player chooses that he is unsure, Kallen becomes shocked when Zero noted his silence mean he refused and prepares to open fire, but Kallen shielded Rai and begged him to join and revealed to him the Black Knights have an intelligence network to discover clues involving his past, leading Rai to have no choice but to join the Black Knights, but comments he will only trust Kallen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://code-geass-lost-colors-translation.yolasite.com/resources/Lost%20Colors%20(Choices),%20(Automatic)%20(After%203)%20Number-25%20(ScAutomatic-25),%20O.doc|title=Code Geass: Lost Colors&gt;Day 11 and onwards&gt;After 2nd Midday &gt;Automatic scene: 25&gt;Choice: O|author=|date=|publisher=|accessdate=30 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''Black Knights'' Route, Rai stops Princess Euphemia from following through with Lelouch's accidental Geass command (an alternate version to episode 22&amp;ndash;23), which he was shot in the process. After Rai woke up and was healed, Kallen shows a great deal of gratitude toward Rai for saving the Japanese and shead in tears as Rai is alive and the two embrace each other as they kiss. Afterwards Rai and Kallen continue to be faithful members of the Black Knights.

====''Geass Route''====
In the ''Geass Route'' ending, Kallen was in the hangar tuning her ''Guren'' and was approached by Rai who wanted to talk to her. When Rai revealed that he's leaving the Black Knights, Kallen was shocked and demanded a reason from him. This led to Rai telling her that he has an illness and doesn't know how long he has left. After hearing this, Kallen ordered him to cure his illness and return. After Rai had left the hangar, Kallen turned to her ''Guren'' and slammed her fist in anger and sadness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://code-geass-lost-colors-translation.yolasite.com/loc-hangar.php|title=Code Geass: Lost Colors Translation|author=|date=|website=code-geass-lost-colors-translation.yolasite.com|accessdate=30 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://code-geass-lost-colors-translation.yolasite.com/resources/Lost%20Colors,%20(Ashford)%20Black%20Knights%20Hideout,%20Hangar,%20(2,3)%20Kallen%20(ScTok-黒の騎士団アジト%20%7B格納庫%7D-Ka-01)%20(Geass%20Route%20End%20Scene).doc Code Geass: Lost Colors&gt;Day 21 or 22&gt;Times: Both Middays&gt;Tokyo scene: Black Knights’ Hideout&gt;Hangar&gt;Characters: Kallen (Geass Route End Scene)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Code Geass (manga)''===
The manga differs from the real series focusing on the Black Knights activities; in the manga Kallen is not present during C.C's appearance. Lelouch's first meeting with her is also different as she bumps into him at school.

Kallen protests at the school rather than at the settlement. She is also apparently Zero's only soldier as only she helps him, such as when they rescue Suzaku.

===''Nightmare of Nunnally''===
In the manga spin-off series ''Nightmare of Nunnally'', Kallen and the other Resistance members took advantage of the arrival of Nunnally's ''Mark Nemo'' Knightmare Frame to make their escape from Britannian forces pursuing them.

When Kallen escapes from the rooftops after she was taken hostage with the other student council members in a hotel at Lake Kawaguchi, she witnesses the arrival of the Mark Nemo. She later met up with Zero, who gave her a suitcase with the Black Knights uniform.

In the battle against Cornelia's forces in the Saitama ghetto, she met up with the Mark Nemo again and witness it destroying all of the Britannian forces, and thought it was on their side, but disagrees and starts to attack Kallen and her group. She was surprised that it knew her moves before it happened and was defeated.

===''Suzaku of the Counterattack''===
In the manga spin-off ''Suzaku of the Counterattack'', Kallen becomes a member of the Black Knight after Zero forms the organization, but has doubts about his methods after a Black Knights faction had gone renegade and orchestrated an attack, taking the lives of nearby civilians, including Lenard Lubie.

When Zero is planning to attack the Britannian Art Gallery with the goal of assassinating the Emperor who has arrived there, Kallen confronted him about whether it would be a trap and also commented that she would still follow him. Admiring her answer and loyalty, Lelouch placed a geass command on her that if anything would happen to him then she would lead the Black Knights. When the Black Knights took the Art Gallery hostage, she is confronted by Suzaku and was surprised that she's not only a member but a half Britannian-Japanese right after he left to stop Zero from killing the Emperor. After Lelouch was captured and accused for killing the Emperor, Kallen assume leadership of the Black Knights as the new Zero and later led the remaining Black Knight members to begin an assault on the Governor Building of Area 11, unaware that Lelouch is freed by Suzaku and are both planning to stop Schneizel.

Five years later, a 22-year-old Kallen is seen walking on the street and still a member of the Black Knights and in contact, but while she was passing by, she suddenly saw someone who resembles a 17-year-old Suzaku, which she thinks she's imagine it.

===''Another Century's Episode: R''===
Kallen makes an appearance in the ''[[Another Century's Episode: R]]'' video game in her Knightmare Frame, the ''Guren'' Mk-II in an alternative event of R2.

Kallen appeared in her world, in an alternative event of episode 6 of the second season, on a mission in her ''Guren Nishki'' to destroy a group of ''Caerleon'' battle ships until a group of ''Sutherland'' Knightmares appears. Kallen manages to defeat them all, but her ''Guren''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s radiation surge wave arm was badly damaged, but also fell when the ship began to shake, which led Rakshata to send her unit to transform her ''Guren Nishki'' to the ''Guren Kashōshiki''. She later proceeds to destroy the other ''Caerleon'' along with Todoh in his ''Zangetsu'' Knightmare and encountered Suzaku in his ''Lancelot'' along with Gino in his ''Tristan'' and Anya in her ''Mordred''. Kallen had fought the three and defeated them, causing Suzaku to order a retreat to the Chinese Federation.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xy2Xl9z9fGs Another Century's Episode R - Guren Kashōshiki Gameplay&lt;/ref&gt;

After Zero kidnaps Empress Tianzi, Kallen fought against Xingke in his Knightmare Frame, ''Shen Hu'', while defending the ''Ikaruga'' flagship from being attacked by a group of ''Gun Ru''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s. After the Enuches plans were exposed to the media, Kallen, along with Zero, C.C., and Xingke, have worked together and attack the Enuches land fortress, ''Leung Tan'', leading them to their deaths while the fortress explode. After being confronted by a fleet of Britannian Knightmares, including the four Rounds, the group encountered an unknown Black Hole and Kallen was sucked in along with Zero and C.C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFfGdaMyvWg|title=YouTube|author=|date=|website=www.youtube.com|accessdate=30 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Super Robot Wars Z 2 Hakai-Hen''===
Kallen and the rest of the Code Geass R1 cast will make their debut to the Super Robot Wars franchise in this game, using their R1 Knightmares.

===''Nunnally in Wonderland''===

'''Karin Magnussen''' (9 February 1908 – 19 February 1997) was a German biologist, teacher and researcher at the [[Kaiser Wilhelm Institute of Anthropology, Human Heredity, and Eugenics]] during the [[Third Reich]]. She is known for her 1936 publication "Race and Population Policy Tools", and her studies of [[heterochromia iridis]] (different-colored eyes) using iris specimens, supplied by [[Josef Mengele]], from [[Auschwitz concentration camp]] victims.&lt;ref name= "EMZ"/&gt;

== Early life and education ==
Karin Magnussen, daughter of the landscape painter and ceramist Walter Magnussen, grew up with her sister in a middle-class home. She completed her schooling in Bremen, graduating with a degree.  She then studied biology, geology, chemistry and physics at the University of Göttingen. Magnussen joined the [[National Socialist German Students' League]] (NSDStB) while she was still an undergraduate in college. By 1931, at the age of 23 years, she was a member of the [[Nazi Party|National Socialist German Workers Party]]. Later, she became a leader of the [[League of German Girls]] (Bund Deutscher Mädel, or BDM) and a member of the [[National Socialist Teachers League]]. As a BDM leader, she held lectures on the politics of race and population. She graduated in 1932 with an examination in the subjects of botany, zoology and geology. In July 1932, her thesis was accepted: ''Studies on the physiology of the butterfly wing''.&lt;ref name= "EMZ"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.estherlederberg.com/Eugenics%20%28CSHL_List%29/Karin%20Magnussen.html|title=Eugenics - Karin Magnussen|publisher=Esther M. Zimmer Lederberg Memorial Website }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After receiving her doctorate, she studied at the Zoological Institute of the University of Göttingen in Alfred Kühn. She placed first and later second on her state exam for a high school teaching position; ''inter alia'' in biology in 1936. In Hanover, Magnussen was employed as a teacher at a secondary school. Magnussen possibly modeled herself after "...the biologist Agnes Bluhm, who worked at the Kaiser-Wilhelm-Institut fur Biologie and wrote "Die rassenhygienischen Aufgaben des weiblichen Arztes", Berlin, 1934, and who unhesitatingly supported Hitler's regime."  In 1935, Magnussen went to work in the Nazi Racial Policy Office in the District of Hanover. A year later, she wrote ''Race and Population Policy Tools''.&lt;ref name= "EMZ"/&gt;

==National Socialist views ==
Magnussen had already joined the National Socialist German Student League (NSDStB) during her studies. In 1931, she became a member of the NSDAP. Later, she became BDM leader and was a member of the National Socialist Teachers League (NSLB).&lt;ref name="ErnstKlee"&gt;Ernst Klee: ''Das Personenlexikon zum Dritten Reich'', Frankfurt am Main 2007, p. 387&lt;/ref&gt; In Bremen, she lectured on racism and demographics. Magnussen was BDM leader in the [[Gau (country subdivision)|Gau]]. In 1935, she was employed in the Gau Hannover in the Racial Politics Office.&lt;ref&gt;Sascha Hönighaus: ''Karin Magnussen'', Berlin 2007, p. 193f.&lt;/ref&gt; Her publication of ''Race and Population Policy Tools'' appeared in 1936.&lt;ref name="ErnstKlee" /&gt; In 1939, this work was published by Lehmann of Munich. After the end of the Second World War, in the Soviet zone of occupation, it appeared on the list of prohibited literature.&lt;ref&gt;Deutsche Verwaltung für Volksbildung in der sowjetischen Besatzungszone, ''Liste der auszusondernden Literatur'', Berlin: Zentralverlag, 1946&lt;/ref&gt;

In the third published edition of 1943, Magnussen expressed the following:
 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"This war is not just about the preservation of the German people, but is about the question, which races and peoples should live in the future on European soil.... Basically England had no interest in the prosecution of this war, but it is a very different people, working parasitically behind the scenes and which is afraid to lose everything. In all of the enemy States, Judaism has significant influence. And just as Judaism had probably the clearest recognition that in the decisive struggle, the question of them was to be decided. The current war must therefore be also about the repression of the black danger in the West and the elimination of the Bolshevik threat in the East, which still resolves a racial problem in Europe, which all States are more or less interested in: the Jewish question. Also the Jew who enjoys life as a host in our country, is our enemy, even if he does not actively engage with weapons in this fight. …From the European point of view, the Jewish question is resolved in that the emigrant Jews do the thinking for the leaders in the other States. We have seen that these emigrants are only troublesome and set up the peoples against each other."&lt;ref&gt;From her book ''Rassen- und bevölkerungspolitisches Rüstzeug''. 3. Aufl. Lehmanns, München 1943, p. 201-203. ''Mit "Schwarze Gefahr" sind vermutlich Afrikaner gemeint, vgl. Rheinlandbastarde, ein beliebtes NS-Feindbild''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Kaiser Wilhelm Institute ==
Due to receiving a scholarship, Magnussen was suspended in the fall of 1941 from her teaching profession and moved to the [[Kaiser Wilhelm Institute of Anthropology, Human Heredity, and Eugenics]] (KWI-A), in Berlin-Dahlem.&lt;ref name="ErnstKlee_a"&gt;Ernst Klee: ''Das Personenlexikon zum Dritten Reich'', Frankfurt am Main 2007, p. 387.
&lt;/ref&gt; From this time on, she worked in the Department of Experimental Pathology of Heritage under the Department head, Hans Nachtsheim.  Her research focused on the inheritance of eye color in rabbits and humans.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfgang Schieder, Achim Trunk: ''Adolf Butenandt und die Kaiser-Wilhelm-Gesellschaft: Wissenschaft, Industrie und Politik im Dritten Reich'', Göttingen 2004, p. 297f.&lt;/ref&gt; Her particular interest was the Heterochromic iris that she had examined since 1938. Magnussen used the scientific method to lead her to the conclusion that the eye is not only genetically, but also hormonally-determined. While there, she initially undertook studies on rabbit eyes.&lt;ref&gt;Sascha Hönighaus: ''Karin Magnussen'', Berlin 2007, p. 195&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1943, she was the research assistant of [[Otmar Freiherr von Verschuer]], at the KWI-A.&lt;ref name="ErnstKlee_a" /&gt; At the KWI-A she also met Dr Mengele, who worked there temporarily.
 
The Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) promoted her study to "explore the heritage conditionality for the development of eye color as a basis for racial and ethnicity studies" in 1943, in addition to eight other research projects at the KWI-A. This project was overseen and the publication edited by Magnussen.&lt;ref&gt;Hans Hesse: "Ich konnte nicht auf die Auswertung eines so wertvollen Materials verzichten - Augen aus Auschwitz: Das Kaiser-Wilhelm-Institut für Anthropologie und der Fall Karin Magnussen", ''WeltOnline'', 31 August 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hans-Walter Schmuhl: ''Grenzüberschreitungen. Das Kaiser-Wilhelm-Institut für Anthropologie, menschliche Erblehre und Eugenik 1927–1945. Geschichte der Kaiser-Wilhelm-Gesellschaft im Nationalsozialismus'', Vol. 9. Wallstein, Göttingen 2005, p. 370&lt;/ref&gt;

== Auschwitz-Birkenau ==
From a colleague, she received the information that more twins and family members with Heterochromic irises would be found in the [[Sinti]] family in [[Mechau]] from northern Germany. Members of the family were taken in the spring of 1943 to the KWI-A, where they were photographed. In March 1943, the Sinti family in the [[Auschwitz concentration camp]] was deported, where Mengele had worked since late May 1943 as camp physician. This circumstance allowed Mengele to carry out the experiments (that Magnussen had done on rabbits) on the people. 
[[File:WP Josef Mengele 1956.jpg|240px|right|thumb|Josef Mengele in 1956. Photo taken by a police photographer in Buenos Aires for Mengele's Argentine identification document.]]
According to a statement by Magnussen, Mengele dealt, among other things, with the eyes of these Sinti family using hormonal substances. Often, these painful interventions resulted in suppuration of the eyes and blindness of the victims. These experiments aimed at the investigation and eradication of the abnormality in people with Heterochromic Irises. In the event of death of the prisoners, Mengele pledged to Magnussen to give her the eyes of the victims for further research and evaluation.&lt;ref name="RolfWinau"&gt;Rolf Winau: ''Medizinische Exeperimente in Konzentrationslagern'', Wolfgang Benz, Barbara Distel (Hrsg.): ''Der Ort des Terrors – Geschichte der nationalsozialistischen Konzentrationslager'', Vol. 1: Die Organisation des Terrors, C.H. Beck, München 2005, {{ISBN|3-406-52961-5}}, p. 174.&lt;/ref&gt; In the second half of 1944, Magnussen received the eyes of the experiment victims from Auschwitz-Birkenau in several deliveries.&lt;ref&gt;Ilkka Remes: ''Das Erbe des Bösen'', p. 3 (pdf).&lt;/ref&gt; No fewer than 40 pairs of eyes should have been received by Magnussen from Auschwitz-Birkenau.&lt;ref&gt;Sascha Hönighaus: ''Karin Magnussen'', Berlin 2007, p. 197&lt;/ref&gt; The Hungarian prisoner pathologist [[Miklós Nyiszli]] noted after the autopsy of Sinti twins that they had been killed, not due to illness, but because of a chloroform injection to the heart. Nyiszli had to prepare their eyes and send them to the KWI-A.&lt;ref name="RolfWinau" /&gt;

== After the war ==
At least until the spring of 1945, Magnussen was working in Berlin.&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Klee: ''Auschwitz, die NS-Medizin und ihre Opfer'', Frankfurt am Main 1997, p. 486.&lt;/ref&gt;
After the end of the Second World War, Magnussen moved to Bremen again and continued her research. Her completed research was published in 1949, being entitled ''"On the relationship between histological distribution of pigment, Iris color and pigmentation of the eyeball of the human eye''."&lt;ref&gt;Hans-Walter Schmuhl: ''Grenzüberschreitungen. Das Kaiser-Wilhelm-Institut für Anthropologie, menschliche Erblehre und Eugenik 1927–1945. Geschichte der Kaiser-Wilhelm-Gesellschaft im Nationalsozialismus'', Vol. 9 Wallstein, Göttingen 2005, p. 490&lt;/ref&gt; She was later denazified in Bremen.

In 1950, Magnussen taught at a girls' high school in Bremen. She worked as study counselor and official, including the teaching of biology. She was considered a popular teacher who led an interesting biology lesson. Magnussen's pupils could examine, for example, living and dead rabbits from their breeding. Until 1964, essays in scientific journals were published by Magnussen. Magnussen retired in August 1970. Even in old age, Magnussen justified the Nazi racial ideology. She noted in 1980, in a conversation with the geneticist [[Benno Müller-Hill]], that the [[Nuremberg Laws]] were not fair enough. She also denied until the last minute that Mengele would have killed children for their scientific studies.&lt;ref&gt;Sascha Hönighaus: ''Karin Magnussen'', Berlin 2007, p. 199f.&lt;/ref&gt; She was entangled by her cooperation with Mengele and the supply of "human material", and mired deep in concentration camp crimes, but she claimed to know nothing about them.

In 1990, Magnussen moved into a nursing home; she died in February 1997 in Bremen.

The '''Katskhi pillar''' ({{lang-ka|კაცხის სვეტი}}, ''kac'xis svet'i'') is a natural [[limestone]] [[monolith]] located at the village of [[Katskhi]] in western [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] [[mkhare|region]] of [[Imereti]], near the town of [[Chiatura]]. It is approximately {{convert|40|m|adj=off}} high, and overlooks the small river valley of Katskhura, a [[Tributary#Terminology|right affluent]] of the [[Qvirila River|Q'virila]].&lt;ref name="acad"&gt;{{ka icon}} Gagoshidze, Giorgi (2010), [http://art.edu.ge/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/G_Gagoshidze1.pdf კაცხის სვეტი ("Katskhi Pillar")]. ''Academia'', No. '''1''': 55–68. ISSN 1512-0899.&lt;/ref&gt;

The rock, with visible church ruins on a top surface measuring {{circa}} 150 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, has been venerated by locals as the Pillar of Life and a symbol of the [[True Cross]], and has become surrounded by legends. It remained unclimbed by researchers and unsurveyed until 1944 and was more systematically studied from 1999 to 2009. These studies determined the ruins were of an [[Early Middle Ages|early medieval]] [[hermitage (religious retreat)|hermitage]] dating from the 9th or 10th century. A [[Georgian alphabet|Georgian]] inscription [[paleography|paleographically]] dated to the 13th century suggests that the hermitage was still extant at that time.&lt;ref name="acad"/&gt; Religious activity associated with the pillar was revived in the 1990s&lt;ref name="ean"&gt;Bardzimashvili, Temo (August 27, 2010), [http://www.eurasianet.org/node/61812 Georgian Monk Builds Stairway to Heaven].

== Architecture ==
The Katskhi pillar complex currently consists of a church dedicated to [[Maximus the Confessor]], a [[crypt]] ([[burial vault (tomb)|burial vault]]), three hermit cells, a wine cellar, and a [[curtain wall (fortification)|curtain wall]] on the uneven top surface of the column. At the base of the pillar are the newly built church of [[Simeon Stylites]] and ruins of an old wall and belfry.&lt;ref name="acad"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dzeg"&gt;{{ka icon}} [http://www.dzeglebi.ge/dzeglebi/k/kacxis_sveti.html კაცხის სვეტი ("Katskhi Pillar")]. Dzeglebi.ge. Accessed May 12, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The church of St. Maximus the Confessor is located at the south-easternmost corner of the top surface of the Katskhi pillar. A small simple [[hall church]] design with the dimensions of 4.5 × 3.5 m., it is a modern restoration of the ruined medieval church built of stone. Beneath and south of the church is an elongated rectangular crypt with the dimensions of 2.0 × 1.0 m., which had served as a burial vault. Digs at the ruined wine cellar revealed eight large vessels known in Georgia as ''k'vevri''. Also of note is a rectangular cellar grotto with the entrance and two skylights—on the vertical surface of the rock, some {{convert|10|m|adj=on}} below the top. At the very base of the pillar there is a cross in relief, exhibiting parallels with similar early medieval depictions found elsewhere in Georgia, particularly at [[Bolnisi cross|Bolnisi]].&lt;ref name="acad"/&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Katskhi stone column (G.N. 2009).jpg|thumb|left|The Katskhi pillar in 2009.]]
In historical records, the Katskhi pillar is first mentioned&lt;ref name="acad"/&gt; by the 18th-century Georgian scholar Prince [[Vakhushti]], who reports in his ''Geographic Description of the Kingdom of Georgia'': "There is a rock within the ravine standing like a pillar, considerably high. There is a small church on the top of the rock, but nobody is able to ascend it; nor know they how to do that."&lt;ref&gt;{{ka icon}} {{fr icon}} Wakhoucht ([[Marie-Félicité Brosset|Brosset, Marie-Félicité]], transl., 1842) [https://books.google.ge/books?ei=n36uT4H3M9DotQaQ7enNBg&amp;id=mkkEAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=description+geographique+de+la+georgie&amp;q=Catzkh#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Description géographique de la Géorgie''], pp. 365–369. St. Petersbourg: A la typographie de l'Academie Impériale des Sciences.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[W.E.D. Allen|Allen, W.E.D.]] (1950). "Two Georgian Maps of the First Half of the Eighteenth Century". ''Imago Mundi'', Vol. 10: 109-110.&lt;/ref&gt; No other written accounts of monastic life or ascents survive. A number of local legends surround the pillar. One of them has it that the top of the rock was connected by a long iron chain to the dome of the [[Katskhi monastery|Katskhi church]], located at a distance of around 1.5&amp;nbsp;km from the pillar.&lt;ref name="acad"/&gt;

In July 1944 a group led by the mountaineer Alexander Japaridze and the writer [[Levan Gotua]] made the first documented ascent of the Katskhi pillar. Vakhtang Tsintsadze, an architecture specialist with the group, reported in his 1946 paper that the ruins found on top of the rock were remains of two churches, dating from the 5th and 6th centuries and associated with a [[stylites|stylite]] practice, a form of Christian [[asceticism]]. Since 1999, the Katskhi pillar has become the subject of more systematic research. Based on further studies and archaeological digs conducted in 2006, Giorgi Gagoshidze, an art historian with the [[Georgian National Museum]], re-dated the structures to the 9th–10th century. He concluded that this complex was composed of a monastery church and cells for hermits. Discovery of the remnants of a wine cellar also undermined the idea of extreme ascetism flourishing on the pillar. In 2007, a small limestone plate with the ''[[asomtavruli]]'' Georgian inscriptions was found, paleographically dated to the 13th century and revealing the name of a certain "Giorgi", responsible for the construction of three hermit cells. The inscription also makes mention of the Pillar of Life, echoing the popular tradition of veneration of the rock as a symbol of the True Cross.&lt;ref name="acad"/&gt;

Religious activity started to revive in 1995, with the arrival of the monk Maxim Qavtaradze, a native of Chiatura.&lt;ref name="ean"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Day|first=Matthew|title=The monk who lives up a rock to get closer to God|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/georgia/10291740/The-monk-who-lives-up-a-rock-to-get-closer-to-God.html|accessdate=7 September 2013|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=6 September 2013|location=[[London]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Between 2005 and 2009, the monastery building on the top of the pillar was restored with the support of the [[National Agency for Cultural Heritage Preservation of Georgia]].&lt;ref name="herit"/&gt; The rock was once accessible to male visitors through an iron ladder running from its base to the top,&lt;ref name="ean"/&gt; but has recently been deemed inaccessible to the public.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="98427">'''[[French Argentines]]''' are Argentines of full or partial [[French people|French descent]], or French-born people who reside in Argentina. Most of French immigrants settled in Argentina from the 1870s until WW1, though consistent immigration started in the 1820s and continued until the late 1940s. Half of these immigrants came from Southwestern France, especially from the [[Northern Basque Country|Basque Country]] and [[Béarn]] (former [[Pyrénées-Atlantiques|Basses-Pyrénées]] accounted for more than 20% of immigrants), as well as [[Bigorre]] and [[Rouergue]], but also from [[Savoy]] and the [[Paris]] region. As early as in the 1840s, Argentina also received immigrants with French background from neighboring countries, notably [[French Uruguayans|Uruguay]]. In 2006, it was estimated that around 6 million Argentines had some degree of French ancestry (up to 17% of the total population).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14200">This is a list of notable people who served as ambulance drivers during the First World War.  A remarkable number—writers especially—volunteered as [[ambulance]] drivers for the [[Allies of World War I|Allied Powers]].  In many cases, they sympathized strongly with the ideals of the Allied Powers, but did not want, or were too young or old, to participate in a combat role. For women, combat was not an option at the time. Several of the Americans on the list volunteered before the United States' 1917 entry into the war. Many of the American writers would later be associated with the [[Lost Generation]].

They lived in [[Sorø]], where they entertained other Danish cultural figures such as [[Hans Christian Andersen]] and [[Bertel Thorvaldsen]].&lt;ref name=kvinfo/&gt; Bernhard Ingemann, who wrote poetry, supported Lucie's interest in painting.&lt;ref name=kvinfo/&gt;

==Career==
Although Ingemann painted a few portraits and genre works, she concentrated mainly on flower paintings and, from the mid-1820s, on religious figures. She showed at the [[Charlottenborg Spring Exhibition]] in 1824 and 1826, in both cases presenting flower paintings. She shared with her husband a deep sense of art and religion with the result that even her flower paintings often reflected religious and mystical themes inspired by German [[Romanticism]].&lt;ref name=weilbach/&gt; Her large biblical compositions and altar paintings are convincing, perhaps thanks to the guidance of [[Johan Ludwig Lund]]. In some cases she abandons perspective in favour of a spaciousness depicting spiritual mystery. 
Her many religious works were integrated in altarpieces in Danish churches, although many have now been removed.&lt;ref name=weilbach/&gt;

Ingemann is one of the few known nineteenth-century women who devoted her life to painting. She also played an important role in the Ingemanns' home despite the fact that references to her come mainly from accounts of her husband's life.&lt;ref name=weilbach/&gt;

==Death==
Lucie Ingemann died in Sorø on 15 January 1868.&lt;ref name=kvinfo/&gt;  &lt;!--is she buried there? what did she die of?  did she have children?  How widespread is her work?--&gt;

==''Rojo Fama Contrafama''==
The last competition in which Maura Rivera participated, the "Rojo Fama Contrafama", she faced the winners of the first three competitions through testing totally new to the program. Of the 15 singers and 16 dancers participating only 8 of each would be selected for a year-long contract with TVN. Maura Rivera earned staunch public support during the show and took part in "Clan of Gold". Rivera was judged eighth in the competition by the actual jury.

While she was already known in by most in the country, it was not until a musical gala in the show ''Gran Rojo'' in the second season that Maura Rivera consolidated her position as one of the most popular personalities on "Rojo Fama Contra Fama". The dancer scored the highest of the night and the highest in the history of the popular program, at 44 points.

After becoming popular, Rivera was invited by the show to record a song with her partner [[Yamna Lobos]]. They recorded a [[cover version|cover]] of the song "La Cocotera" (The Coconut) and earned a gold record.

==Biography==
Born September 9, 1958,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Warner, Michael, 1958– |url=http://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n88058532.html |website=Library of Congress Name Authority File |location=Washington |publisher=Library of Congress |access-date=September 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Warner received two [[Master of Arts]] degrees, from the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] and [[Johns Hopkins University]], in 1981 and 1983 respectively.&lt;ref name="Yale University"&gt;{{cite web |last=Warner |first=Michael |title=CV |url=https://english.yale.edu/sites/default/files/cv-warner.06.10.pdf |dead-url=no |location=New Haven, Connecticut |publisher=Yale University |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170517093731/https://english.yale.edu/sites/default/files/cv-warner.06.10.pdf |archive-date=May 17, 2017 |access-date=September 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He received his [[Doctor of Philosophy]] degree in English from Johns Hopkins University in 1986. Warner assumed his position at [[Yale University]] in 2007, and became Seymour H. Knox Professor of English Literature and American studies in 2008. Prior to his work at Yale, he taught at [[Northwestern University]] (1985–1990) and [[Rutgers University]] (1990–2007).

Warner is highly influential in the fields of early [[American literature]], [[social theory]], and [[queer theory]]. His first book, ''The Letters of the Republic: Publication and the Public Sphere in Eighteenth-Century America'', established him as a leading scholar in Early American literature, print culture, and [[public sphere]] theory. He later became a public figure in the [[gay community]] for his book ''[[The Trouble With Normal (book)|The Trouble with Normal]]'', in which Warner contended that [[queer theory]] and the ethics of a queer life serve as critiques of existing social and economic structures, not just as critique of heterosexuality and heterosexual society. His most recent work, ''Publics and Counterpublics'' is a collection of essays on the politics of communication in advanced capitalistic societies, or [[Habermasian]] public sphere theory.

Warner is currently working on the history of [[secularism]] in early America, from the early eighteenth century to the Civil War, culminating with the work of [[Walt Whitman]], a writer on whom many of his interests converge.

Warner has been a permanent fellow of Rutger University's Center for Critical Analysis of Contemporary Culture since 2001, and was a director from 2006-2008.&lt;ref name="Yale University"/&gt;  He also sits on a number of Advisory Boards, including that of the [[Center for Lesbian and Gay Studies]] (since 1999), the Society for the Humanities at [[Cornell University]] (since 2003), and the [[Library of America]] Colonial Writing Project (since 2005).&lt;ref name="Yale University"/&gt;

Warner is, along with [[Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick]], [[Teresa de Lauretis]],{{efn|De Lauretis coined the term ''[[queer theory]]'' although the way in which it is used today differs from what she originally suggested by the term.{{sfn|Halperin|2003}}}} [[Lauren Berlant]], and [[Judith Butler]], considered one of the founders of [[queer theory]].

== Overview of major works ==

=== ''The Trouble With Normal'' ===

{{Main| The Trouble With Normal (book)}}

In ''The Trouble With Normal'', Warner critiques same-sex marriage activism and other moves more generally by the gay rights movement toward equality in normalcy. The book has been described as a classic of the debates on normalcy as a goal for the gay rights movement, and as an important contribution to queer theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Azzolina |first=David |year=2003 |title=Review of ''The End of Gay (and the Death of Heterosexuality)'' by Bert Archer |magazine=Library Journal |volume=128 |issue=2 |location=New York |page=105 |issn=0363-0277}}&lt;/ref&gt; Martha Nussbaum, writing in the ''New Republic'', praised the book's moral opposition to "the domination of the 'normal': "Warner is a deft and thoughtful writer who turns his own experience of the margins into a source of genuine understanding about America and its sexual politics...what Warner's book finally demands of us is...genuine reflection." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Nussbaum |first=Martha C. |author-link=Martha Nussbaum |year=2000 |title=Experiments in Living |magazine=The New Republic |volume=222 |issue=1 |pages=31–36 |issn=0028-6583}}&lt;/ref&gt; First published in 1999 by The Free Press, an imprint of Simon and Schuster, it was re-published in 2000 in paperback by Harvard University Press. Warner argues that the right to marry is an inadequate and ultimately undesirable goal for gay rights activism. Chapter one, "The Ethics of Sexual Shame", argues that people with deviant sexualities have been shamed, as a result of American society's relegation of sex to the private domain, where it is not talked about.{{sfn|Warner|1999|pp=33, 40}} It provides a list of sexual hierarchies, as well as discussion of stigma, shame, moral panics, and queer life.{{sfn|Warner|1999|pp=25–26}} Chapter two, "What's Wrong with Normal?", critiques the notion of normalcy. In this chapter, Warner looks at the arguments of [[Georges Canguilhem]] and [[Alfred Kinsey]] to discuss issues with the concept of norms and "The Normalized Movement" within gay rights activism.{{sfn|Warner|1999|pp=54–58, 61–80}} Chapter three, "Beyond Gay Marriage", takes the concepts from chapter two to argue against same-sex marriage, and marriage as an institution that reinforces privacy and diminishes the queer counterpublic.{{sfn|Warner|1999|p=147}} Chapter four, "Zoning Out Sex", discusses the zoning laws put in place by [[New York City]] Mayor [[Rudy Giuliani]].{{sfn|Warner|1999|p=150}} These laws were also critiqued in the article Warner co-wrote with [[Lauren Berlant]] in 1998, titled "Sex in Public".{{sfn|Berlant|Warner|1998}} The conclusion "The Politics of Shame and HIV Prevention", discusses some of the health strategies of fighting HIV/AIDS, and how the cycle of shame increases the risk of spreading the disease.{{sfn|Warner|1999|p=218}} The book, according to ''Kirkus Reviews'', argues "persuasively" against same-sex marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |year=1999 |title=The Trouble with Normal |url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/michael-warner/the-trouble-with-normal/ |website=Kirkus Reviews |access-date=September 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=September 2018}}

=== ''Publics and Counterpublics'' ===

''Publics and Counterpublics'' is a collection of essays based around the central question "what is a public?" Around half of the essays in the book have been published previously.{{sfn|Warner|2002|pp=16–17}} Chapter one, "Public and Private", reviews the definitions of these terms, and traces the history of debates around public and private spheres, particularly around the women's liberation, and then the gay rights, movements.{{sfn|Warner|2002|pp=16–17}} Chapter two, "Publics and Counterpublics", looks at redefining and expanding upon the term ''public'', to introduce multiple publics.{{sfn|Warner|2002|pp=67–117}} The chapter then introduces the concept of counterpublics, initially termed by [[Nancy Fraser]] to mean a public that is subordinate to a dominant public.{{sfn|Warner|2002|p=118}} Chapter three, "Styles of Intellectual Publics", considers the style of discourse in academic work and the impact this has on the type of public it creates.{{sfn|Warner|2002|p=14}} It suggests that [[Michel Foucault]] might have described intellectual work as a counterpublic, and discusses this possibility.{{sfn|Warner|2002|p=158}} Chapter four, "The Mass Public and the Mass Subject", responds to [[Jürgen Habermas]]' ''[[The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere]]'' introducing some of the concepts we now regard as [[queer theory]].{{sfn|Warner|2002|p=16}} As the essay was originally published in 1989, it was written before the term ''queer theory'' had become widely used. Chapter five, "Sex in Public", was co-written with Lauren Berlant, and published previously in 1998.{{sfn|Warner|2002|p=17}} "Sex in Public" serves as a case study in the struggles over the mediation of publics, and is very similar, thematically, to ''The Trouble With Normal''.{{sfn|Warner|2002|p=17}} Chapter six, "Something Queer About the Nation State", discusses queer politics and activism, and its relationship to the state. Chapter seven, "A Soliloquy 'Lately Spoken at the African Theatre': Race and the Public Sphere in New York City, 1821", considers an historical counterpublic and its context, and the texts that upheld it. Chapter eight, "Whitman Drunk" critiques [[Walt Whitman]]'s work ''[[Franklin Evans]]'' and its reception in the context of temperance activism.{{sfn|Warner|2002|p=277}}

''Publics and Counterpublics'', argues fellow queer theorist Ken Plummer, extended the public/private debate and contributed to the development of queer theory.{{sfn|Plummer|2003|p=1421}}

Both of these major works discuss to some extent how queer straddles the public/private divide. ''The Trouble With Normal'' argues that the gay rights struggle for marriage equality is a struggle for normalcy, and privacy. This privacy, Warner argues, comes at the cost of those who do not marry, who choose to conduct themselves in public.{{sfn|Warner|1999|p=96}} ''Publics and Counterpublics'' considers the [[public sphere]] and its shortcomings, before considering how queer both exists in, and is subordinated by, publics. Warner calls the two books "mutually illustrative", with ''The Trouble With Normal'' critiquing the way gay rights movements have obscured queer counterpublics, one of the central concepts of ''Public and Counterpublics''.{{sfn|Warner|2002|pp=18–19}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="34015">[[Chauncey Bailey]] was an American journalist who was murdered in [[Oakland, California]] in August 2007 to prevent him from publishing an investigative piece into the finances of [[Your Black Muslim Bakery]].

==Murder==
Bailey was shot and killed while working on a story about the finances of [[Your Black Muslim Bakery]], involving its pending bankruptcy.&lt;ref name="ktvu2"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.ktvu.com/news/13812780/detail.html | title=Police Link Bailey Homicide To Black Muslim Group | work=KTVU News | date=2007-08-03 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070817105429/http://www.ktvu.com/news/13812780/detail.html | archivedate=2007-08-17 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tribune3"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.insidebayarea.com/oaklandtribune/ci_6544355 | title=Cops: Editor's killer confesses |author1=Harry Harris |author2=Kristin Bender |author3=Kelly Rayburn  |lastauthoramp=yes | work=The Oakland Tribune | date=2007-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the shooting, the ''Post'' publisher Paul Cobb revealed on television that, prior to Bailey's killing, Cobb had withheld from publication a story that Bailey had written earlier, saying only that it was about "things like" what happened to Bailey. He later stated that the police had asked him not to reveal anything about the matter. On August 6, 2007 a former employee of the bakery, Ali Saleem Bey, who is not a relative of the bakery's owner, but who adopted the Bey name, revealed that he was Bailey's source for the withheld story, which the ''Post'' had decided was not ready for publication. Bailey had asked Bey to give him the story.&lt;ref name="Tribune7"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://origin.insidebayarea.com/oaklandtribune/localnews/ci_6562958 | title=Slain editor's bakery source surfaces | author=Josh Richman | work=The Oakland Tribune | date=2007-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Ali Bey, the bakery business had been seized from its rightful heirs in a coup through fraud and forgery, by a ruthless, younger branch of the family, beginning with Antar Bey and culminating with the current chief executive officer, [[Yusuf Bey IV]]. Ali revealed that in June 2005, John Bey, the former head of the Bey security service, was driven out of town with his family after an attempt on his life in a shooting outside his home. John had tried to expose the fraud behind the coup. In 2005, Antar Bey mortgaged the bakery property, to cover back taxes and other debt, and then defaulted, which led to threat of foreclosure.&lt;ref name="Tribune7"/&gt;
An attorney for the ''Post'' also confirmed that Bailey had been working on the story about the "financial status of the organization" and including the possibly criminal "activities of a number of people who were working in the organization".&lt;ref name="Tribune7"/&gt;

On October 24, 2006, Your Black Muslim Bakery, Inc. filed for [[Chapter 11]] bankruptcy, listing its CEO as Yusuf Ali Bey, otherwise known as Yusuf Bey IV. With $900,000 in debts, owed mostly to the mortgage holder, the building was about to be foreclosed upon. The remaining debt, $200,000, was owed to the [[Internal Revenue Service]]. The day after Bailey's death, on August 3, 2007 U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Edward Jellen ordered the case to be converted to [[Chapter 7, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 7]] liquidation effective August 9, 2007.&lt;ref name="Tribune4"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.insidebayarea.com/oaklandtribune/localnews/ci_6544356 | title=Esteemed enterprise spirals out of control |author1=Angela Hill  |author2=Josh Richman  |lastauthoramp=yes | work=The Oakland Tribune | date=2007-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Final days==
By 2007 Bailey was living in an apartment near the south end of [[Lake Merritt]], not far from downtown Oakland.&lt;ref name="Tribune1"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.insidebayarea.com/ci_6534337 | title=Prominent journalist shot dead in street |author1=Harry Harris  |author2=Angela Hill  |lastauthoramp=yes | work=The Oakland Tribune | date=2007-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was known to walk to work as a daily routine, and to stop for breakfast at a [[McDonald's]] restaurant at 14th Street and Jackson Street, about a half-block from where he was killed in the 200 block of 14th Street, becoming Oakland's 72nd homicide of 2007.&lt;ref name="Tribune1"/&gt;

On the morning of August 2, 2007, Bailey set out on his usual walk to work. Unknown to him, Devaughndre Broussard, a 19-year-old handyman at Your Black Muslim Bakery, who was on probation for a San Francisco robbery conviction, had discovered Bailey's residence. Broussard had worked at the bakery as a handyman and cook between August 2006 and March 2007, before leaving to find other work. He was rehired at the bakery in July 2007.&lt;ref name="Tribune3"/&gt;

===Assassination===
Broussard then, in a white [[Ford Aerostar]] van, began driving around the route he thought Bailey would be taking to work. Broussard insisted that he acted alone, but police believe he had an accomplice in the van. At 7:25&amp;nbsp;a.m. Broussard spotted Bailey leaving the McDonald's restaurant where Bailey regularly stopped to eat breakfast. Broussard then got out of the van, parked on Alice Street. Wearing a mask and dark clothing, he approached Bailey with the shotgun. A witness said Bailey said: "Please don't kill me." The witness claimed he recognized Bailey, and that he was in trouble, but stopped in his tracks when he saw the shotgun.&lt;ref name="Tribune10"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.insidebayarea.com/oaklandtribune/ci_6571657 | title=Cops: Killer 'stalked' editor prior to ambush |author1=Harry Harris  |author2=Martin G. Reynolds  |lastauthoramp=yes | work=The Oakland Tribune | date=2007-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As he walked from home to work, Bailey was shot dead around 7:30&amp;nbsp;a.m. on 14th Street near Alice Street in Oakland's [[Lakeside Apartments District, Oakland, California|Lakeside Apartments District]] in what police described as an assassination.&lt;ref name="sfgate"/&gt; Witnesses said the single gunman wearing dark clothing and a ski mask approached Bailey and fired at least three rounds from a shotgun, hitting Bailey at least once in the chest, then fled on foot to a waiting van and drove off.&lt;ref name="sfgate"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tribune1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ktvu"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.ktvu.com/news/13805439/detail.html | title=Veteran Reporter Gunned Down In Oakland | work=KTVU News | date=2007-08-02}}&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The gunman first fired a shotgun blast at Bailey's chest, then stood over him and fired again [[execution style]] at Bailey's face while Bailey was down, and then fired a [[coup de grâce]] to make sure he was dead. The assassin then escaped in the van.&lt;ref name="Tribune10"/&gt; Bailey was pronounced dead at the scene.&lt;ref name="Tribune1"/&gt;

Police Chief Wayne Tucker described the killing as "unusual" because it occurred downtown and in broad daylight.&lt;ref name="sfgate"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2007/08/02/BAGGCRBL8A6.DTL&amp;tsp=1 | title=Hit man kills newspaper editor on Oakland street |author1=Christopher Heredia |author2=Leslie Fulbright |author3=Marisa Lagos |lastauthoramp=yes | work=San Francisco Chronicle | date=2007-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Mossberg 500|Mossberg]] shotgun used in the murder was later identified as one stolen during a liquor store vandalism two years prior suspected to have been committed by members of [[Your Black Muslim Bakery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2007/10/05/MNELSL1NT.DTL&amp;tsp=1 | title=Trail of the shotgun in editor's slaying | author=Jaxon Van Derbeken | work=The San Francisco Chronicle | date=2007-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bailey was survived by his father, three of his four siblings, and his teenage son living in southern California. A funeral mass was held at the East Oakland St. Benedict's Catholic Church on the morning of August 8, 2007, with an overflowing crowd of 700 in attendance, including a line of people outside for more than an hour into the service. Attendees included Oakland Mayor [[Ron Dellums]], [[U.S. Representative]] [[Barbara Lee]], actress Luenell, assistant dean of the [[University of California at Berkeley]] Graduate School of Journalism [[Paul Grabowicz]] who once worked with Bailey at the Tribune, and well-known local attorney [[John Burris]]. Bailey was buried at [[Holy Sepulchre Cemetery (Hayward, California)|Holy Sepulchre Cemetery]] in nearby [[Hayward, California|Hayward]].&lt;ref name="Tribune8"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.insidebayarea.com/ci_6563000?source=most_emailed | title=Oakland newsman Bailey to be laid to rest Wednesday | author=Kristin Bender | work=The Oakland Tribune | date=2007-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tribune12"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.insidebayarea.com/ci_6581036?source=most_viewed | title=Hundreds mourn Bailey |author1=Angela Hill |author2=Jamaal Johnson |author3=Cecily Burt  |lastauthoramp=yes | work=The Oakland Tribune | date=2007-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Suspects==

=== Shooter ===
Devaughndre Broussard grew up in San Francisco's [[Western Addition]] district. The office of the San Francisco District Attorney revealed that in January 2006, at age 18, Broussard plead guilty to an assault charge, and served a first-time offender sentence of one year in San Francisco county jail. Upon release, Broussard was also ordered to three years of supervised probation.&lt;ref name="Tribune11"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.insidebayarea.com/ci_6571658?source=most_viewed | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929103238/http://www.insidebayarea.com/ci_6571658?source=most_viewed | title=Bakery leader, cohorts charged |author1=Harry Harris |author2=Paul T. Rosynsky | work=The Oakland Tribune | date=2007-08-08 | archivedate=2007-09-29 | accessdate=2008-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to his probation status, he was wanted on an outstanding failure-to-appear warrant for his arrest, charged with a 2006 assault with a firearm in San Francisco.&lt;ref name="Tribune5"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.insidebayarea.com/oaklandtribune/localnews/ci_6550155 | title=Confessed killer: I'm 'a good soldier' |author1=Angela Hill  |author2=Harry Harris  |lastauthoramp=yes | work=The Oakland Tribune | date=2007-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Police revealed that on the night of August 1, 2007, Broussard first went looking for Bailey at his apartment complex, having discovered Bailey's residence near the south end of Lake Merritt. Early on the next morning of August 2, 2007 Broussard looked for Bailey at his office, but Bailey had not yet arrived.&lt;ref name="Tribune3"/&gt; Police revealed that Broussard also went looking for Bailey twice again at his apartment complex that morning. At 7:17&amp;nbsp;a.m. an [[AC Transit]] bus driver may have seen Broussard near Bailey's apartment, standing outside with the shotgun at First Avenue and International Boulevard. The driver called his dispatcher, who reported the incident to the Alameda County Sheriff's Office. The driver continued on his route, and deputies responded to the location, but could not locate the man in their search.&lt;ref name="Tribune10"/&gt;

Yusuf Bey IV was born in Oakland in 1986, the son of Daulet and [[Yusuf Bey]], the latter of whom was the founder of the [[Your Black Muslim Bakery]].&lt;ref name="ProminentBakery"&gt;

Bey IV lived a chaotic, violent life before his arrest for participating in the murder of journalist Chauncey Bailey.

Yusuf Bey IV grew up in what must have been a turbulent home. His father Yusuf Bey had several children with multiple women, and in 1988, when Bey IV was two, three of the women left the home and took their nine children with them. At the time of his death in 2003, Bey Sr. was said to have fathered 42 children by various women. He had one legal wife, Farieda Bey.&lt;ref name="ProminentBakery"/&gt; Bey's followers and "wives" often took his surname, although no legal adoptions or marriages took place. Bey claimed he had "spiritually" adopted followers who used his name.&lt;ref name="Killing"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; People who worked for the bakery were considered "members" of the business and the [[mosque]] from which the bakery had grown.&lt;ref name="1968Case"&gt;

Bey IV was arrested in [[El Cerrito, California]], in September 2001 after failing to stop at a stop sign. Police discovered a magazine with bullets in his possession. He was 15 at the time.&lt;ref name="ProminentBakery"/&gt;

Despite years of suspicion and serious brushes with the law, Yusuf Bey Sr. remained uncharged with any wrongdoing until 2002.&lt;ref name="BloodMoney"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In that year, he was accused of [[lewd conduct]] by a girl who had been a [[foster child]] of Nora and Yusuf Bey twenty years earlier. [[DNA]] evidence was conclusive enough for prosecutors to schedule a court date, but before the trial could begin, Bey died of [[cancer]].&lt;ref name="Fiefdom"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bey Sr. had spent years preaching [[African American Muslims|Black Muslim]] sermons on Oakland radio, and the arrest and charge came as a somewhat of a shock to the surrounding community, who regarded the elder Bey as a local hero because of his renowned business, his support for [[Black Power|black empowerment]], his association with prominent politicians, and his supposed adherence to his Black Muslim faith.&lt;ref name="Fiefdom"/&gt;

===Battle for control of the bakery===
After the death of Bey Sr., Waajid Aljawwaad (who sometimes used the additional last name of Bey), a follower of Bey Sr.,  became the [[CEO]] of the business as Yusuf Bey Sr.'s designated successor. However, on February 27, 2004, Aljawwaad failed to arrive for work at the bakery. His body, bound with electrical tape and wrapped in a tarpaulin, was found in Oakland Hills in July of that year. No one was ever charged with the crime.&lt;ref name="Fiefdom"/&gt;

[[Antar Bey]], Daulet and Yusuf Bey's son and older brother of Yusuf Bey IV, seized control of the bakery. Antar's half siblings and their mothers protested and fought with him over control of the business, but to no avail; Antar was able to retain control and force them out. He soon took out $700,000 in loans that went into default.&lt;ref name="DayOne"&gt;

 |date=March 23, 2011
}}&lt;/ref&gt; But in October 2005, Antar was killed in a [[carjacking]] in Oakland. Authorities suspected Yusuf Bey IV of ordering Antar's execution but could not provide proof. Oakland police charged a man unrelated to the bakery with the murder.&lt;ref name="Fiefdom"/&gt;

After this, Bey IV took full control of the business.

====Bakery ownership years (2005–2007)====
Bey IV seemed primarily interested in the profits the bakery earned and the power over the members of the business his father had engendered, not the day-to-day operation of the business. He alternately took money from the business and conducted various fraud operations to support himself and the business before it failed.&lt;ref name="Fiefdom"/&gt; His father, the bakery and its members had enjoyed years of protection from the media and politicians against bad publicity, investigations and even prosecution, continuing up to the lewd conduct charge against Yusuf Bey Sr.&lt;ref name="BloodMoney"/&gt;

After the death of his father, gaining control of the bakery and associated security businesses, and triumph over the feuding family members, Bey IV's crimes grew more and more serious. Despite several arrests, he remained free and flouted subpoenas and ignored court dates. His lawyer said at the time, "The view was, 'We're Black Muslims, we can do anything we want.' They got sucked in. I thought it was 'acting out' behavior. But it caused just a whirlwind of trouble."&lt;ref name="Fiefdom"/&gt;

Bey IV continued his father's practice of delivering fiery Black Muslim sermons to bakery followers. In one videotaped sermon dated to July 2007, Bey IV said, "We fight the government, we fight the police, we fight our own families, we fight our own people, and we fight Caucasian people daily—just to do right."&lt;ref name="Speeches"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the crimes Bey IV committed during this period included theft by deception and forgery involving the purchase of several cars; fraudulent [[sub-prime]] home loan applications; possession of a firearm after attempting to open a checking account using forged identification; and a bizarre kidnapping and assault on a woman Bey IV believed was connected with drug dealers who owed him money, or whom he could rob.&lt;ref name="Rapsheet"/&gt;

====Criminal record====
Below are some of the charges and arrests for Yusuf Bey IV.

* In November 2005, Bey IV was charged with grand theft for fraud connected with the purchase of a 2002 [[Mercedes (car)|Mercedes]] from a [[Vallejo, California|Vallejo]] car dealership. He used a stolen identity to buy the car and pleaded no contest when the crime was discovered. A [[Solano County, California|Solano County]] judge allowed him to remain free.&lt;ref name="Rapsheet"/&gt;
* That same month, a group of men in suits, presumably led by Bey IV, stormed two Muslim-owned stores that sold liquor. The men destroyed wine in cases and groceries. Bey IV later claimed, "If you say you're a Muslim, you should have the action of a Muslim," and that alcohol was "killing our people".&lt;ref name="Fiefdom"/&gt;
* In 2006, Bey IV was charged with [[assault with a deadly weapon]] after he tried to run over the [[Bouncer (doorman)|bouncer]] of a San Francisco strip club from which he'd been ejected.&lt;ref name="Rapsheet"/&gt;
* In June 2006, Bey IV purchased a home in Oakland using falsified information. The sub-prime loan involved a first and second mortgage, and investigators later theorized the motive was to obtain money from the home's equity. The loan went into [[default (finance)|default]] in October. Bey IV used his own [[Social Security number]] but a [[driver's license]] with a falsified name for the loan paperwork.&lt;ref name="Rapsheet"/&gt; Later, investigators discovered that Bey IV and his associates had purchased a total of five homes, most of which were in default.&lt;ref name="Fiefdom"/&gt;
* That same month, Bey IV and some associates used false information to buy three cars from a [[San Bruno]] dealership, which later resulted in charges of grand theft. Bey IV used the same name to purchase the cars that he had used to purchase the house in Oakland.&lt;ref name="Rapsheet"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fiefdom"/&gt; One of the accomplices later said he could not remember using a false name or several other details of the fraudulent car purchase or the liquor store vandalism, in which he also allegedly participated.&lt;ref name="Reluctant"&gt;

* In May 2007, Bey IV and four men kidnapped a woman and took her to the home of Bey's brother-in-law. The men beat the blindfolded woman and demanded money supposedly owed to Bey IV. While the crime was in progress, police saw a [[Crown Victoria]], a car often used by police, outside the house and grew suspicious.&lt;ref name="Fiefdom"/&gt; Police went to the door and the men fled on foot, leaving their cars behind. The police confiscated the vehicles as evidence and Joshua Bey, Bey IV's half-brother, was arrested. Since the arrest, Bey IV has alternately admitted and denied various aspects of this crime.&lt;ref name="Rapsheet"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RunIns"&gt;

* Bey IV wanted Alfonza Phillips Sr., the father of the man who killed Antar Bey, executed. But because Bey IV's [[accomplice]] Devaughndre Broussard could not find Phillips, Bey IV told him to kill another relative of the carjacker, Odell Roberson.&lt;ref name="Follower"&gt;{{cite news

He said at trial that he had fired eight or ten rounds and carried out the murder "because Yusuf Bey IV told me to".&lt;ref name="Laughter"&gt;

* Later in 2007, Bey IV, Antoine Mackey and Devaughndre Broussard were driving around Oakland discussing the [[Zebra murders|"Zebra" murders]]. Bey IV or Broussard saw Michael Wills, a white man who worked as a chef, returning to work on foot after purchasing a pack of cigarettes. Bey IV and his accomplices discussed who should kill Wills and Mackey volunteered. He got out of the car and shot Wills six times. The three left the scene and returned to the bakery compound.&lt;ref name="DayOne"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RunIns"/&gt;

==Investigation and trial for murder==
On the day of the killing Oakland Police and [[Crime Stoppers]] of Oakland offered up to $25,000 in reward money for information leading to the arrest of the killer.

Beginning early at 5 a.m. on the following morning of August 3, 2007, more than 200 Oakland police officers and [[SWAT]] team members armed with [[search warrant]]s closed off a number of blocks of [[San Pablo Avenue]], a major thoroughfare in North Oakland. The area of focus included homes and the business properties of [[Your Black Muslim Bakery]], which operated two business locations on either side of the street between Stanford Avenue and 59th Street. The group is a [[African American Muslims|Black Muslim]] splinter organization founded by [[Yusuf Bey]], and now led by his son [[Yusuf Bey IV]]. The pre-dawn raids followed a two-month investigation into a variety of violent crimes, including kidnapping and murder. Police used stun grenades and broke down doors to gain entry. In a news conference later that day, Oakland Deputy Police Chief Howard Jordan said that several weapons and other evidence of value linked the killing of Chauncey Bailey to members of the group.&lt;ref name="ktvu2"/&gt; Police also recovered spent ammunition from the rooftops, and detained 19 people for questioning.&lt;ref name="Tribune3"/&gt;

In addition to the bakeries, the police also raided nearby homes. In the 1000 block of 59th Street, police recovered, from a closet,&lt;ref name="Tribune7"/&gt; the shotgun used in the killing of Bailey at the home where Broussard was also detained. The rear yard of the home connected directly to the bakery property.&lt;ref name="Tribune5"/&gt; Police also raided a home in the 900 block of Aileen Street a few blocks east of the bakery.&lt;ref name="Tribune3"/&gt; Of the 19 detainees on that morning, five were arrested along with Broussard, and Yusuf Bey IV, on probable cause arrest warrants, along with other outstanding arrest warrants, stemming from the prior investigations.&lt;ref name="Tribune3"/&gt;

Broussard was booked on suspicion of murder on August 4, 2007, for the killing of Bailey, having told police detectives that he considered himself "a good soldier". Though other charges were made against those arrested, none of them were charged with Bailey's murder.&lt;ref name="Tribune5"/&gt; On August 7 Broussard was arraigned in Alameda County Superior Court, on charges of murder and possession of a firearm by a convicted felon.&lt;ref name="Tribune11"/&gt;

Broussard initially confessed to killing Bailey, then recanted his confession. In a 2008 ''[[60 Minutes]]'' interview, Broussard claimed he was coerced by Yusuf Bey IV to plead guilty for the benefit of the bakery and others arrested.&lt;ref name=Cooper&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2011/03/10/60minutes/main20040084.shtml |title=Transcript: Devaughndre Broussard Interview (Anderson Cooper) |author1=Cooper, Anderson  |author2=Broussard, Devaughndre  |lastauthoramp=yes |date=March 10, 2011 |work=60 Minutes |publisher=CBSNews |accessdate=2011-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview for CBS News, Broussard said that the Oakland Police put him and Bey IV together in a room, and that Bey IV convinced him to plead guilty for the purpose of releasing other murder suspects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2011/03/10/60minutes/main20040084.shtml | work=CBS News | title=Transcript: Devaughndre Broussard Interview}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later pled guilty to manslaughter charges in exchange for a 25-year sentence and full testimony at the trial of Bey IV and others.&lt;ref name=Lee&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2011/03/28/BAF01IKVNI.DTL&amp;tsp=1 |title=Chauncey Bailey shooter laughed at killings |author=Lee, Henry K. |date=March 28, 2011 |work= |publisher=San Francisco Chronicle |accessdate=2011-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2008 a videotape of Bey IV in custody whispering to his half-brother Joshua Bey and another bakery associate, Tamon Halfin, and disclosing details of Bailey's murder was obtained and posted by the Chauncey Bailey Project.&lt;ref name="Videotape"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Journalists from the Chauncey Bailey Project created a transcription of the conversation which seemed to indicate Bey was involved in Bailey's murder.

A grand jury indicted Bey IV with ordering the execution of Chauncey Bailey in April 2009, almost two years after the murder.&lt;ref name="Indicted"&gt;

Broussard testified for the prosecution at the trial of Bey IV and Antoine Mackey in 2011. He stated in court that Bey ordered him to find, track and kill Bailey before the journalist could print his latest article on the bakery.&lt;ref name=Lee/&gt;

On June 9, 2011 Bey IV and Mackey were both convicted by a trial jury of multiple counts of murder&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2011/06/09/BADE1JRSPI.DTL |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110612132400/http://www.sfgate.com:80/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2011/06/09/BADE1JRSPI.DTL||archive-date=June 12, 2011 |dead-url=yes|title=Your Black Muslim Bakery leader guilty of murder |author=Lee, Henry K. |date=June 9, 2011 |work= |publisher=San Francisco Chronicle |accessdate=2011-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://abclocal.go.com/kgo/story?section=news/local/east_bay&amp;id=8328565|title=Two men sentenced to life in prison in Chauncey Bailey murder case|last=Anthony|first=Laura|date=August 26, 2011|work=KGO-TV|accessdate=4 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yusuf Bey IV was found guilty of three counts of first-degree murder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Thomas Peele |url=http://www.chaunceybaileyproject.org/2011/06/09/former-your-black-muslim-bakery-leader-yusuf-bey-iv-guilty-for-murdering-chauncey-bailey/|title=Former Your Black Muslim Bakery leader Yusuf Bey IV guilty for murdering Chauncey Bailey|accessdate=9 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 Bey's attorney, Lorna Brown, was convicted of smuggling documents out of jail for him. One of the documents, a hit list ordering an associate to kill a witness, was intercepted by police before the associate could carry out the murder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/breaking-news/ci_23665422/judge-calls-four-year-suspension-lawyer-who-admitted|title=Judge calls for four-year suspension for lawyer who admitted smuggling documents for Yusuf Bey IV|last=Peele|first=Thomas|date=July 15, 2013|work=San Jose Mercury News|accessdate=4 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, a state appeals court upheld the convictions of Yusuf Bey IV and Antoine Mackey.&lt;ref name="upheld"&gt;http://www.sfgate.com/crime/article/2-lose-appeal-in-killing-of-Oakland-journalist-6018383.php&lt;/ref&gt;

Bey IV also threatened former bakery followers to intimidate them from testifying against him. Based on recorded calls between Bey IV and follower Kahlil Raheem, Bey first cajoled and then warned Raheem not to testify against him.&lt;ref name="Videotape2"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the trial progressed, allegations of intimidation by Bey IV and other former bakery members persisted. The ''Contra Costa Times'' editorialized on April 30, 2011, that the intimidation must stop and that the judge, [[Thomas Reardon]], along with bailiffs and the sheriff should get control of the trial to allow justice to be done.&lt;ref name="Intimidation"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some witnesses called to testify changed their story from the original information they gave the police or said they did not remember what happened. A man who worked at the convenience store that Bey IV allegedly attacked with his followers said he did not remember over 50 times at trial.&lt;ref name="NoMemory"&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1993">'''Nelson Hackett''' (born c. 1810) was an escaped [[slavery|slave]] who fled to Canada.  In 1841 he escaped from his [[Arkansas]] master, [[Alfred Wallace]] on a stolen horse, and 6 weeks later crossed the border and entered Canada.

Wallace, however, refused to let the matter drop, and he was well connected, particularly to the [[Governor of Arkansas]], [[Archibald Yell]].  Wallace and an associate, George C. Grigg, travelled to Canada and made out dispositions against Hackett for stealing the horse, as well as a gold watch belonging to Wallace.

Despite opposition from [[Upper Canada]]'s [[attorney general]], [[William Henry Draper]], Hackett was extradited to the United States on the order of [[Charles Bagot|Sir Charles Bagot]], due to his theft of the watch, which exceeded what was necessary to take in order to facilitate his escape to freedom.
Public reaction from [[abolitionism|abolitionists]], in England, Canada and the United States was strong.  Politicians in the [[British House of Commons]] and Upper Canada's executive council questioned the motives for the extradition, as well as its legality.

Wallace seems to have been intent on "teaching a lesson" to American slaves; namely that Canada would not prove to be a safe haven for them.  The fact that his legal bills far exceeded Hackett's market value seems to bear this out. In any event, his strategy failed. Hackett's escape brought more attention to Canada as a refuge for slaves, and when the extradition clause of the [[Webster-Ashburton Treaty]] was finally negotiated, slaves were protected from extradition to their former American masters.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2446">'''Omar Oussedik''' ([[Transliteration|transliterate]]d variously) (1920 or 1922 in [[Ain El Hammam]], [[Algeria]] – June 1992 in [[Algiers]], [[Algeria]]) was an [[Algeria]]n [[nationalist]] politician and independence leader, born in a [[berber people|Berber]] family from the [[Kabylie]] region.[http://www.khouasweb.123.fr/articles.php?lng=fr&amp;pg=1076]

At about age 22, he was drawn to the movement for Algerian self-rule and [[independence]], joining the [[Parti du peuple algérien]] (PPA) headed by [[Messali Hadj]]. Following the [[Sétif massacre]], he was among those who pushed for the formation of an armed clandestine network, the [[Organisation Spéciale]] (OS). The OS was soon crushed by France, and in 1948 he was arrested by [[France]] and imprisoned in [[Blida]] military prison, where he was tortured. After being freed in 1951, he left to live in France, where he was active in the Algerian [[labor movement]].

He returned to join the newly formed [[National Liberation Front (Algeria)|Front de libération nationale]] (FLN) in 1955, under the [[nom de guerre]] of '''Si Tayeb'''. During the Algerian [[Algerian War of Independence|War of Independence]] (1954–62), he held political missions such as a post in the provisional [[exile government]] of the FLN, the [[Gouvernement Provisoire de la République Algérienne]], (GPRA) between 1958 and 1960. He later worked as FLN representative in [[Guinea]], which supported the Algerian revolt.

After independence in 1962, he served as [[ambassador]] of Algeria in the [[Soviet Union]], [[Bulgaria]], [[India]] and [[Italy]], under then-[[foreign minister]] [[Abdelaziz Bouteflika]]. He died in 1992.

'''Pandyanda I. Belliappa''' (or '''Pandianda I. Belliappa''') was a Gandhian, a freedom fighter and politician from the erstwhile state of [[Coorg]].

==Freedom Struggle==
Belliappa entered politics in 1921 as a member of the Coorg Planters' Association.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Report on the Administration of Coorg|date=1923|publisher=Government of India|location=Coorg, India|page=19|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FZs-AQAAMAAJ&amp;q=pandianda&amp;dq=pandianda&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=gqIhVOyEGpehugTbjoDYBw&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwBQ|accessdate=23 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later joined the Congress Party and became one of its prominent members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Muthanna|first1=I.

==Coorg State==
In 1952, he separated from the Congress along with others and fought the Coorg state elections as independents while floating a new party called the Takkadi ('justice scales') party. The issue they fought against was the proposed merger of Coorg with Mysore. They lost the elections to the Congress, led by C M Poonacha, but won nine of the Assembly seats. The Takkadi party was a dominant political force and voice in Coorg with its anti-merger plank.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=RAMACHANDRA|first1=C.M.|title=Coorg and the reorganisation of States|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/coorg-and-the-reorganisation-of-states/article5253017.ece|accessdate=23 September 2014|agency=The Hindu|publisher=The Hindu|date=20 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=CHINNAPPA|first1=K.

'''Panos Kolokotronis''' ({{lang-el|Πάνος Κολοκοτρώνης}}) was the eldest son of the Greek General [[Theodoros Kolokotronis]] and his mother was Aikaterini Karousou ({{lang-el|Αικατερίνη Καρούσου}}). He was born on the island of [[Zakynthos]] in 1800, while his father was serving there as a Major in the British Infantry. He fought along with his father in the [[Greek War of Independence]] and distinguished himself in many battles.

In 1822, he married Eleni, the daughter of [[Laskarina Bouboulina]].

In 1825, during the second [[Greek civil wars of 1824–1825|civil war]], he was murdered in [[Tripoli]] by order of the revolutionary government.

'''Peter Michael Davidson''' (born November 16, 1993)&lt;ref name="tvg" /&gt; is an American comedian and actor. He is a cast member on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''. Davidson has also appeared on the [[MTV]] shows ''[[Guy Code]]'', ''[[Wild 'n Out]]'', and ''[[Failosophy]]''.&lt;ref name="MTV" /&gt;&lt;ref name="5N6VJ" /&gt; He has performed stand-up comedy on ''[[Adam DeVine's House Party]]'', ''[[Jimmy Kimmel Live!]]'', and ''[[Comedy Underground with Dave Attell]]'', and guest-starred in ''[[Brooklyn Nine-Nine]]''.&lt;ref name="EW9.15.14" /&gt;

==Early life==
Davidson was born November 16, 1993, in [[Staten Island|Staten Island, New York]], the son of Amy (''née'' Waters) and Scott Matthew Davidson.&lt;ref name="tvg" /&gt;&lt;ref name="sidad" /&gt; His father was of mostly Jewish heritage and his mother is of Irish ancestry; Davidson was raised Catholic.&lt;ref name="NYTimes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FmZVw" /&gt; He has a younger sister named Casey.&lt;ref name="fMHy6" /&gt; His father was a [[New York City Fire Department|New York City firefighter]] who [[Emergency workers killed in the September 11 attacks|died in service]] during the [[September 11 attacks]];&lt;ref name="nyp" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ggwHy" /&gt; he was last seen running up the stairs of the [[Marriott World Trade Center]], just prior to its collapse. Davidson, who was seven years old at the time, was profoundly affected by the loss. He told ''[[The New York Times]]'' that it was "overwhelming" and that he would often act out in school as a result of the trauma, at one point ripping his hair out until he was bald.&lt;ref name="NYTimes" /&gt; In October 2016, Davidson revealed on ''[[The Breakfast Club (radio show)|The Breakfast Club]]'' morning radio show that he struggled with suicidal thoughts when he was younger, and that the music of rap artist [[Kid Cudi]] saved his life.&lt;ref name="Yahoo" /&gt;

Davidson first tried his hand at stand-up comedy at age 16 in a Staten Island bowling alley, where a group of friends, knowing of his comedy aspirations, dared him to take to the stage. He did so only after smoking marijuana.&lt;ref name="SFChronicle" /&gt; Davidson, who has suffered from [[Crohn's disease]] since the age of 17 or 18, at the time said he "cannot function" without marijuana, adding that he would not be able to work on ''Saturday Night Live'', and that attempts to perform without it have not been successful. He explained that he "can perform when [he's] not high, but it wouldn't be that much fun for [him]."&lt;ref name="HighTimes" /&gt; He attended [[St. Joseph by the Sea High School|St. Joseph by-the-Sea High School]], then [[Tottenville High School]] before transferring to [[Xaverian High School]] in Brooklyn where he graduated in 2011. His mother still works as the school nurse at the latter. Following high school, he enrolled at [[St. Francis College]] in [[Brooklyn Heights]],&lt;ref name="sidad" /&gt; remaining briefly before dropping out.&lt;ref name="EW9.15.14" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Diamondback" /&gt;

==Career==
Davidson's earliest onscreen appearance was in the third episode of the MTV comedy series ''Failosophy'', which premiered February 28, 2013. The following month, he appeared in "PDA and Moms," a third-season episode of the [[MTV2]] reality TV comedy series ''[[Guy Code]]'', the first of four episodes in which he was featured.&lt;ref name="MTV" /&gt; That June, his first televised standup aired as part of a second-season episode of the [[Comedy Central]] program ''Gotham Comedy Live'', which showcases standup comedians at the Gotham Comedy Club in New York City. The following month, he returned to MTV2 with an appearance on ''[[Nick Cannon Presents: Wild 'N Out]]'', his first of six episode appearances on that show.

Davidson subsequently made standup appearances on ''[[Adam Devine's House Party]]'', ''[[Jimmy Kimmel Live!]]'', ''[[Comedy Underground with Dave Attell]]'', and guest-starred in ''[[Brooklyn Nine-Nine]]''. In 2014, he acquired a role in a Fox comedy pilot, ''Sober Companion'',&lt;ref name="w7Qmd" /&gt; but it ultimately did not make it to series.&lt;ref name="2BTEh" /&gt;

Davidson joined the cast of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' with that show's 40th-season premiere, which debuted on September 27, 2014. At age 20, he was the first ''SNL'' cast member to be born in the 1990s, and one of the youngest cast members ever.&lt;ref name="Diamondback" /&gt;&lt;ref name="62uvd" /&gt; The first new addition to the cast that season,&lt;ref name="EW9.15.14" /&gt; Davidson was given a chance to audition for the show through regular [[Bill Hader]], whom he had met while filming a small part in the 2015 [[Judd Apatow]] feature film comedy ''[[Trainwreck (film)|Trainwreck]]''.&lt;ref name="EW9.29.14" /&gt; Hader subsequently told producer [[Lorne Michaels]] about him. His debut garnered positive critical notice,&lt;ref name="EW9.29.14" /&gt;&lt;ref name="79ryC" /&gt; with his most noted skits during the season including an ''[[Indiana Jones]]''-style sketch in which he and [[Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson]], after being pelted with poison darts, were forced to mutually suck poison out of each other's various body parts,&lt;ref name="SFChronicle" /&gt;&lt;ref name="wB33v" /&gt; an endeavor that eventually found them entangled in the [[69 (sex position)|"69" position]].&lt;ref name="kDWXs" /&gt; Another involved Davidson being shot in the chest with an arrow by [[Norman Reedus]].&lt;ref name="SFChronicle" /&gt;

In March 2015, Davidson was a roaster on the ''[[Comedy Central Roast]]'' of [[Justin Bieber]],&lt;ref name="LvdAO" /&gt; and his set was praised as one of the best of the show.&lt;ref name="6kjF7" /&gt; Among his bolder jokes was one at the expense of fellow roaster [[Snoop Dogg]] and host [[Kevin Hart]], and their 2004 film ''[[Soul Plane]]''. Davidson, whose firefighter father died responding to the September 11 attacks, called that film "the worst experience of my life involving a plane."&lt;ref name="SFChronicle" /&gt;

In 2016, Davidson was on the [[Forbes 30 Under 30|''Forbes'' 30 under 30]] list.&lt;ref name="forbes" /&gt; Also in 2016, Davidson recorded his first stand-up special ''Pete Davidson: SMD.'' The [[Comedy Central]] special was filmed in [[New York City]]. He made an appearance on ''[[The Jim Gaffigan Show]].''{{cn|date=August 2018}}

In November 2018, Davidson was criticized for his comments mocking the Republican congressional candidate and veteran [[Dan Crenshaw]], who wears an eye patch because of an injury from the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|War in Afghanistan]]. Davidson compared Crenshaw to a "hitman in a porno movie", and added, "I'm sorry, I know he lost his eye in war, or whatever."&lt;ref name="aGWVs" /&gt;&lt;ref name="sovs5" /&gt;&lt;ref name="1f3JM" /&gt;&lt;ref name="4sJV8" /&gt; Davidson later invited Crenshaw for a Weekend Update segment on SNL. In the episode, Davidson apologized to Crenshaw, and they made further jokes and references that it is [[Veterans Day]].&lt;ref name="Itzkoff" /&gt; Crenshaw and others have speculated that the joke may have helped him win [[Texas's 2nd congressional district]] in the midterm election.&lt;ref name="wapoJoke" /&gt;&lt;ref name="esquire" /&gt;

==Comedy style==
Davidson has been lauded for basing his comedy on his own life and employing aspects of his life that have been likened to "a series of brutal truths and vulgar confessions," and which make him relatable to audiences. Touching upon topics such as marijuana, sex, and relationships, incidents he relates include those from his awkward high school experiences to living in a dormitory during his brief stint at [[St. Francis College]].&lt;ref name="Diamondback" /&gt; Davidson jokes about highly sensitive subjects, including the loss of his father during the September 11 attacks, because, he says, he finds that it empowers him to address the feeling of powerlessness that experiencing such tragedy at a young age inflicted upon him.&lt;ref name="NYTimes" /&gt; He is a fan of the ''[[Harry Potter]]'' franchise, and has incorporated that material into his comedy work as well.&lt;ref name="Diamondback" /&gt;&lt;ref name="EW9.29.14" /&gt;

==Personal life==
As of October 2015, Davidson lives in [[Brooklyn Heights|Brooklyn Heights, New York]].&lt;ref name="NYTimes" /&gt;

The death of Davidson's father caused psychological problems for him growing up. His father was a [[Rescue and recovery effort after the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center#Firefighters|firefighter and first-responder]] during the [[September 11 attacks]].&lt;ref name="qWczX" /&gt; Davidson has his father's badge number, 8418, tattooed on his left arm.&lt;ref name="NYTimes" /&gt;

Davidson supported [[Hillary Clinton]] in the [[2016 U.S. presidential election]], and on December 5, 2017, he stated on his [[Instagram]] account that he got a tattoo on his leg of Clinton, whom he called his "hero", a "badass", and "one of the strongest people in the universe." Clinton herself thanked Davidson for the compliment, commenting, "This makes it significantly less awkward that I've had a Pete Davidson tattoo for years."&lt;ref name="G5xOk" /&gt;

He was diagnosed with [[Crohn's disease]] at age 17 or 18,&lt;ref name="HighTimes" /&gt; for which he receives intravenous treatment&lt;ref name="NYTimes" /&gt; and used [[medical marijuana]] as a pain reliever.&lt;ref name="HighTimes" /&gt; On March 6, 2017, Davidson announced on his Instagram account that he had quit drugs and was sober for the first time in eight years.&lt;ref name="Yahoo" /&gt; During an interview on comedian [[Marc Maron]]'s podcast, Davidson clarified that the only drug he used was marijuana and, while he has since cut back its use considerably, the personal problems he initially assumed were a result of his daily marijuana habit were actually caused by [[borderline personality disorder]], for which he has since been undergoing treatment.&lt;ref name="IxgX9" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MtaTl" /&gt;

Davidson previously dated Cazzie David for two years.&lt;ref name="Lrs1D" /&gt;&lt;ref name="V9XXK" /&gt;&lt;ref name="EWS63" /&gt; On June 20, 2018, Davidson confirmed that he and singer and actress [[Ariana Grande]] were engaged to be married.&lt;ref name="USAT Engagement" /&gt; On October 14, 2018, it was reported that the engagement was called off.&lt;ref name="mJ420" /&gt;&lt;ref name="4G7kL" /&gt;&lt;ref name="QewPQ" /&gt; Grande's song "[[Pete Davidson (song)|Pete Davidson]]" appears on her 2018 album ''[[Sweetener (album)|Sweetener]]''.

'''Richard Wilson Austin''' (August 26, 1857 &amp;ndash; April 20, 1919) was an [[United States|American]] politician, attorney and diplomat.  A [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]], he served in the [[United States House of Representatives]] from 1909 to 1919, representing [[Tennessee's 2nd congressional district|Tennessee's 2nd district]].  Prior to his congressional tenure, he worked as a [[United States Marshals Service|United States Marshal]] from 1897 to 1906, and served as the U.S. [[consul (representative)|consul]] to [[Glasgow, Scotland]], from 1906 to 1907.&lt;ref name=mcclung&gt;"Richard Wilson Austin," ''[http://cmdc.knoxlib.org/cdm/compoundobject/collection/p15136coll4/id/2536/rec/1 Men of Affairs in Knoxville]'' (Knoxville Lithographing Company, 1917). Accessed at the McClung Digital Collection, 16 August 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Austin was born on August 26, 1857, in [[Decatur, Alabama]], the son of John and Mary (Parker) Austin. He attended public schools in [[Loudon County, Tennessee]], and studied law at the [[University of Tennessee]]. He was admitted to the [[bar association|bar]] in 1878, and commenced practice in [[Knoxville, Tennessee]].&lt;ref name=mcclung /&gt;

Austin served as a clerk in the [[Post Office Department]] at [[Washington, D.C.]], from 1879 to 1881.  He worked as Assistant [[Doorkeeper of the United States House of Representatives]] under his future political ally, [[Walter P. Brownlow]], from 1881 to 1883, during the [[Forty-seventh United States Congress|Forty-seventh Congress]]. He was a special agent of the [[United States Department of War|War Department]] from 1883 to 1885. In 1885, he engaged in newspaper work in Knoxville. He then returned to Decatur, Alabama, and continued the practice of law. He was the private secretary of Congressman [[Leonidas C. Houk]] from Tennessee in 1888, and was the city attorney of Decatur, Alabama.&lt;ref name=bioguide&gt;{{cite web|title=Richard W. Austin|url=http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=A000341|publisher=Biographical Directory of the United States Congress|accessdate=1 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Austin ran for Alabama's [[Alabama's 8th congressional district|8th district]] seat in the U.S. House of Representatives in 1890, but lost to the incumbent, former Confederate general [[Joseph Wheeler]], 16,821 votes to 12,076.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=332308 Alabama District 8: 1890], Our Campaigns. Retrieved: 17 August 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; He was a delegate to the [[1892 Republican National Convention]] at [[Minneapolis]]. He returned to Knoxville in 1893 to edit the ''Knoxville Republican''.&lt;ref name=bioguide /&gt;

Following the death of Leonidas Houk in 1891, the Tennessee Republican Party gradually split into two quarreling factions: one led by Brownlow, which Austin supported, and the other led by former congressman [[Henry Clay Evans]] of Chattanooga, which had the support of Chattanooga businessman [[Newell Sanders]].  At the [[1896 Republican National Convention]], Austin and Brownlow helped thwart Evans' bid for the vice presidential nomination.  Brownlow was elected to Congress by the [[Tennessee's 1st congressional district|1st district]] later that year.  The president considered Evans for the office of [[Postmaster General of the United States|Postmaster General]], but the appointment went to [[James A. Gary]] of [[Maryland]], due in part to the influence of Brownlow and Austin.&lt;ref&gt;Phillip Langsdon, ''Tennessee: A Political History'' (Franklin, Tenn.: Hillsboro Press, 2000), pp. 227-229.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1897, President McKinley appointed Austin [[United States Marshals Service|United States Marshal]] for the [[United States District Court for the Eastern District of Tennessee|Eastern District of Tennessee]].  One of the more notable actions of Austin as marshal came in June 1903, when he organized an unsuccessful effort to recapture outlaw [[Kid Curry]], who had escaped from a Knoxville jail.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Smokov, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=5-kosT_32RcC&amp;pg=PA268&amp;dq=%22r.+w.+austin%22+tennessee&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=LXAOUujiMa242QXI3IHgBA&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwAzgK#v=onepage&amp;q=%22r.%20w.%20austin%22%20tennessee&amp;f=false He Rode with Butch and Sundance: The Story of Harvey (Kid Curry) Logan]'' (University of North Texas Press, 2012), pp. 268-270.&lt;/ref&gt;

Austin ran for Tennessee's [[Tennessee's 2nd congressional district|2nd district]] congressional seat in 1904, but was defeated in the primary by [[Nathan W. Hale]], who had the support of the Evans-Sanders block.&lt;ref&gt;Langsdon, ''Tennessee: A Political History'', p. 240.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1906, Austin was appointed United States [[consul (representative)|consul]] at [[Glasgow, Scotland]]. He remained at this post until November 1907, when he resigned and returned to Tennessee to mount another congressional campaign.

==Congress==

In 1908, the quarrel between the Evans-Sanders and Brownlow-Austin factions intensified when powerful Knoxville businessman [[William J. Oliver (industrialist)|William J. Oliver]], a friend of Brownlow and Austin, led a band of armed ruffians to the state party's convention in Nashville, where they beat up Sanders and chased away his supporters.  Determined to defeat Hale, the Brownlow faction aligned itself with the [[Malcolm R. Patterson|Malcolm Patterson]] faction of the state's Democratic Party, which was facing a similar rift between supporters of Patterson and supporters of his gubernatorial opponent, [[Edward W. Carmack]].  The Brownlow Republicans offered to vote for Patterson for governor, and in return, Patterson Democrats would vote for Austin in the 2nd district congressional election.  With this support, Austin edged Hale on election day,  15,337 votes to 14,528.&lt;ref&gt;Langsdon, ''Tennessee: A Political History'', pp. 251-253.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ourcampaigns&gt;[http://www.ourcampaigns.com/CandidateDetail.html?CandidateID=129406 Richard W. Austin], Our Campaigns. Retrieved: 17 August 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Richard-wilson-austin-2.jpg|left|180px|thumb|Congressman Austin, photographed by [[Harris &amp; Ewing photo studio|Harris &amp; Ewing]] in 1914]]

Incensed, Hale and his supporters attempted unsuccessfully to prevent Austin from caucusing with House Republicans.  [[John Chiles Houk]], who generally supported the Evans-Sanders faction, convinced Patterson to abandon his support for Austin and Brownlow.  This move proved untimely, however, as Patterson's popularity plummeted due to his actions in the aftermath of the Cooper-Carmack shootout.  Though Hale had the support of Houk and the influential ''Knoxville Journal'', Austin had the support of President [[William Howard Taft]].&lt;ref&gt;Langsdon, ''Tennessee: A Political History'', pp. 261-265.&lt;/ref&gt;  Following a savage campaign in 1910, Austin again defeated Hale, this time by a margin of 15,761 votes to 11,755.&lt;ref name=ourcampaigns /&gt;

In 1912, Republicans were again divided, with some remaining loyal to Taft, and others throwing their support behind [[Theodore Roosevelt]] and the [[Progressive Party (United States, 1912)|Progressive Party]] ticket.  In the 2nd district congressional election, Austin remained loyal to Taft and ran on the Republican ticket.  W. H. Buttram, who had the support of John Chiles Houk and Knoxville attorney [[Hugh B. Lindsay]], ran on the Progressive ticket.  J.C.J. Williams ran as a Democrat.  Though Roosevelt outpolled Taft in the 2nd district, Austin was easily reelected, garnering 12,712 votes to 7,025 for Buttram, and 6,681 for Williams.&lt;ref name=ourcampaigns /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Langsdon, ''Tennessee: A Political History'', pp. 278-280.&lt;/ref&gt;

Austin was easily reelected in 1914 and 1916.  At the [[1916 Republican National Convention]], he openly squabbled with ex-Governor [[Ben W. Hooper]] (a Sanders ally) over the state's delegate to the national committee.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=74MMAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA104&amp;dq=%22r.+w.+austin%22+tennessee&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=bnUOUu2lM7CQyQHPxoCgAQ&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwADgo#v=onepage&amp;q=%22r.%20w.%20austin%22%20tennessee&amp;f=false Official Report of the Proceedings of the Sixteenth Republican National Convention]," (Tenny Press, 1916), p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt;  The persistent enmity of Houk, Sanders and Hooper finally took its toll in the March 1918 Republican primary, when Austin was defeated for the nomination by state party chairman [[J. Will Taylor]].&lt;ref&gt;Langsdon, ''Tennessee: A Political History'', pp. 288-296.&lt;/ref&gt;

During his five terms in Congress, Austin, a Taft ally, generally supported protectionist measures, such as tariffs on foreign imports.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=DrYmAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA155&amp;dq=%22r.+w.+austin%22+tennessee&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=SXgOUt-4JoHXygGFlIGYAw&amp;ved=0CDsQ6AEwAzgy#v=onepage&amp;q=%22r.%20w.%20austin%22%20tennessee&amp;f=false Credit &amp; Financial Management]'', Volume 16 (1916), p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt;  In February 1911, Austin delivered a memorial address on the House floor for Brownlow, who had died the previous year.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://books.google.com/books?id=W-Y3AQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=RA4-PA40&amp;dq=%22It+is+with+the+most+profound+feeling+of+sorrow+that+I+rise%22+brownlow&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=1R0QUqm2NKLD2QXq8oHgCg&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22It%20is%20with%20the%20most%20profound%20feeling%20of%20sorrow%20that%20I%20rise%22%20brownlow&amp;f=false Address of Mr. Austin, of Tennessee]," ''House Documents for the 61st Congress'', December 5, 1910 - March 4, 1911, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;   In 1915, he supported a national exchange system that would help match job seekers with employers looking for help.&lt;ref&gt;Udo Sautter, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=2E0jZ5VlUkEC&amp;pg=PA83&amp;dq=%22richard+w.+austin%22+tennessee&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Pm4OUqiuLLOByQGoz4HQBw&amp;ved=0CF0Q6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22richard%20w.%20austin%22%20tennessee&amp;f=false Three Cheers for the Unemployed: Government and Unemployment Before the New Deal]'' (Cambridge University Press, 1991), p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt;  During the House debate on the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|19th Amendment]] in January 1918, Austin, referring to Congressman [[Jeannette Rankin]] of Montana, argued, "The highest, best, and strongest evidence that women's suffrage is a success has been established in this House by the enviable record made by our colleague from Montana, who has won the respect, confidence, and admiration of the members and officials of this House."&lt;ref&gt;Norma Smith, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=Q85tHVOJR50C&amp;pg=PA125&amp;dq=%22richard+wilson+austin%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=yGsOUu-7FaWqyQHb3YHQDQ&amp;ved=0CD8Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22richard%20wilson%20austin%22&amp;f=false Jeannette Rankin, America's Conscience]'' (Montana Historical Society, 2002), p. 125.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Austin died in [[Washington, D.C.]], on April 20, 1919, just over a month after the end of his final congressional term. He is [[burial|interred]] at [[Old Gray Cemetery]] in Knoxville, Tennessee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Richard W.

Art has been critical of NATO's expansion, writing presciently in 1998 that

{{Quote|The United States and its NATO allies have gotten themselves into a real pickle […] [w]ith their decision to enlarge NATO by taking in Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic […] How large can a NATO-without-Russia become before the West more or less permanently alienates Russia? […] Taking in Ukraine without also inducting Russia is the quickest way to alienate Russia […] and would justifiably give rise within Russia to fears of encirclement by, and exclusion from, the West.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Art | first = Robert J. | authorlink = Robert J.

'''Serge Cormier''' {{post-nominals|country=CAN|MP}} (born 1975) is a [[Canada|Canadian]] [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]] politician, who was elected to represent the [[electoral district (Canada)|riding]] of [[Acadie—Bathurst]] in the [[House of Commons of Canada]] in the [[Canadian federal election, 2015|2015 federal election]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/canada-votes-2015-new-brunswick-results-1.3278750&lt;/ref&gt;

Cormier's father was an inshore fisherman.  He studied business administration, financing his studies by acquiring a small company.  He later worked for the government of [[New Brunswick]] as the chief of staff to various government departments, and then as a policy analyst for [[Brian Gallant]] in both the office of the [[Leader of the Opposition (New Brunswick)|Official Opposition]] and of the [[Premier of New Brunswick]].  He served as an advisor to Gallant with responsibility for northern New Brunswick.  He worked as a riding organizer for both the federal and provincial Liberal parties.&lt;ref&gt;[https://sergecormier.liberal.ca/biography/ Meet Serge], Liberal.ca.&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 27, 2015, he was nominated to be the federal Liberal candidate in [[Acadie—Bathurst]] for the [[Canadian federal election, 2015|2015 election]]. The riding had been held by [[Yvon Godin]] of the [[New Democratic Party]] since 1997, but Godin opted to retire rather than seek re-election, and Cormier ran against [[Jason Godin]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/acadie-bathurst-liberals-nominate-serge-cormier-to-run-in-next-election-1.3049923 Acadie—Bathurst Liberals nominate Serge Cormier to run in next election], CBC News, April 27, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;  He won the election, in what was considered an upset victory, as the Liberals swept the Atlantic provinces.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/acadie-bathurst-riding-results-1.3278809 Acadie-Bathurst tilts to Liberal Serge Cormier], CBC News, October 19, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sir William Duncan Godfrey, 3rd Baronet''' {{Post-nominals|JP|DL}} (1797–1873) was an [[Anglo-Irish]] aristocrat and landowner.&lt;ref&gt;John Knightly, ''The Godfrey Estate During the Great Famine'' http://www.kerryhistory.ie/documents/5.%20Godfrey.pdf (Accessed 25 February 2014), 125-149&lt;/ref&gt;

Sir William Godfrey was born at Kilcolman Abbey, [[Milltown, County Kerry|Milltown]] on the family estate in [[County Kerry]], [[Ireland]].&lt;ref&gt;1818 – Kilcoleman Abbey, Milltown, Co. Kerry, from Archiseek http://archiseek.com/2011/1818-kilcoleman-abbey-milltown-co-kerry/#.Uwsq2_l_vAk&lt;/ref&gt;  He was the son of Sir John Godfrey, 2nd Baronet. He was sent to [[England]] for his education, attending [[Westminster School]]. He subsequently studied at an academy in [[Geneva]], before embarking on the [[Grand Tour]].&lt;ref&gt;John Knightly, ''The Godfrey Estate During the Great Famine'' http://www.kerryhistory.ie/documents/5.%20Godfrey.pdf (Accessed 25 February 2014), 125&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite his cosmopolitan upbringing, Godfrey returned to Ireland following his travels in Europe, and remained in County Kerry for most of his life. He was appointed a [[Justice of the Peace]] in 1822 and became a captain of the Milltown Infantry contingent in 1824. He was sworn in as [[High Sheriff of Kerry]] in 1829. At the insistence of his friend, [[Valentine Browne, 2nd Earl of Kenmare]], Godfrey was made a [[Deputy Lieutenant]] for Kerry in 1832.&lt;ref&gt;John Knightly, ''The Godfrey Estate During the Great Famine'' http://www.kerryhistory.ie/documents/5.%20Godfrey.pdf (Accessed 25 February 2014), 125&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the 1830s, Sir William Godfrey managed the estates of both his brother-in-law, John Coltsmann of [[Flesk Castle]] and that of his cousin, [[Arthur Blennerhassett (1799–1843)|Arthur Blennerhassett]] of Ballyseedy. He was an avid farmer, and unlike many Anglo-Irish landowners, he took a keen interest in his estate and tenants. He was recognised by the Royal Agricultural Improvement Society of Ireland for his promotion and use of advanced farming techniques.&lt;ref&gt;John Knightly, ''The Godfrey Estate During the Great Famine'' http://www.kerryhistory.ie/documents/5.%20Godfrey.pdf (Accessed 25 February 2014), 125&lt;/ref&gt;  Politically, Godfrey aligned himself with the liberal wing of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]], although he never stood for elected office. He was known to be sympathetic towards [[Catholic emancipation]]. During the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Irish famine]] of the 1840s, Godfrey organised and chaired several local relief committees. In May 1846, Sir William purchased a
large quantity of Indian meal to bridge the period before the first potato crops became available. He lobbied the government in [[London]] on numerous occasions, warning in October 1846 that, "the people have endured their wants &amp; privations with resignation and patience but if employment and relief are delayed much longer, the peace &amp; tranquillity of this district must be seriously endangered."&lt;ref&gt;Sir William Godfrey to Earl of Bessborough, 12 October 1846, National Archives Ireland, CSO RP-D/6648/1846.&lt;/ref&gt;

Godfrey was a stalwart and committed supporter of the established [[Anglican]] [[Church of Ireland]] although his wife, Mary Teresa, was a devout [[Roman Catholic]]. The couple had ten children and in a family compromise, the boys were raised as Anglicans and the girls as Roman Catholics. He was succeeded in his title by his eldest son, John Fermor Godfrey.

==Origin==
[[File:koshinscroll.jpg|thumb|right|Kōshin scroll with the three monkeys|right]]
[[File:Oak Ridge Wise Monkeys.jpg|thumb|A World War II poster directed at participants in the [[Manhattan Project]]]]
The source that popularized this pictorial [[Maxim (philosophy)|maxim]] is a 17th-century carving over a door of the famous [[Nikkō Tōshō-gū|Tōshō-gū]] shrine in [[Nikkō]], [[Japan]]. The carvings at  Tōshō-gū Shrine were carved by Hidari Jingoro, and believed to have incorporated  [[Confucius]]’s Code of Conduct, using the monkey as a way to depict man’s life cycle. There are a total of eight panels, and the iconic three wise monkeys picture comes from panel 2.  The philosophy, however, probably originally came to Japan with a [[Tendai]]-[[Buddhist]] legend, from China in the 8th century ([[Nara Period]]). It has been suggested that the figures represent the three dogmas of the so-called middle school of the sect.

In [[Chinese language|Chinese]], a similar phrase exists in the late ''[[Analects of Confucius]]'' from 2nd to 4th century B.C.: "Look not at what is contrary to propriety; listen not to what is contrary to propriety; speak not what is contrary to propriety; make no movement which is contrary to propriety" ({{lang|zh|非禮勿視，非禮勿聽，非禮勿言，非禮勿動}}).&lt;ref&gt;Original text: [[s:zh:論語#顏淵第十二|論語]] {{zh icon}}, [[s:The Analects#Part 12|Analects]] {{en icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; It may be that this phrase was shortened and simplified after it was brought into Japan.

It is through the [[Kōshin]] rite of [[folk religion]] that the most significant examples are presented.  The Kōshin belief or practice is a Japanese folk religion with Chinese [[Taoism]] origins and ancient [[Shinto]] influence. It was founded by Tendai Buddhist monks in the late 10th century. A considerable number of stone monuments can be found all over the eastern part of Japan around [[Tokyo]]. During the later part of the [[Muromachi period]], it was customary to display stone pillars depicting the three monkeys during the observance of Kōshin.

Though the teaching had nothing to do with monkeys, the concept of the three monkeys originated from a simple play on words. The saying in Japanese is {{nihongo|''mizaru, kikazaru, iwazaru''|見ざる, 聞かざる, 言わざる|extra2="see not, hear not, speak not"}}, where the ''-zaru'' is a negative conjugation on the three verbs, matching ''zaru'', the [[Rendaku|modified]] form of {{nihongo|''saru''|猿}} "monkey" used in compounds. Thus the saying (which does not include any specific reference to "evil") can also be interpreted as referring to three monkeys.

The shrine at Nikko is a Shinto shrine, and the monkey is an extremely important being in the [[Shinto]] religion. The monkey is believed to be the messenger of the Hie Shinto shrines, which also have connections with Tendai Buddhism. There are even important festivals that are celebrated during the [[Monkey (zodiac)|year of the Monkey]] (occurring every twelve years) and a special festival is celebrated every sixteenth year of the [[Kōshin]].

"The Three Mystic Apes" (Sambiki Saru) were described as "the attendants of Saruta Hito no Mikoto or Kōshin, the God of the Roads".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Joly|first=Henri L.|title=Legend in Japanese Art|url=https://archive.org/stream/legendinjapanese00jolyuoft/legendinjapanese00jolyuoft_djvu.txt|publisher=J. Lane|accessdate=13 December 2011|location=London, New York|page=10|year=1908}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Kōshin festival was held on the 60th day of the calendar. It has been suggested that during the Kōshin festival, according to old beliefs, one’s bad deeds might be reported to heaven "unless avoidance actions were taken…". It has been theorized that the three Mystic Apes, Not Seeing, Hearing, or Speaking, may have been the "things that one has done wrong in the last 59 days".

According to other accounts, the monkeys caused the ''Sanshi'' and ''Ten-Tei'' not to see, say or hear the bad deeds of a person. The {{nihongo|''Sanshi''|三尸}} are the [[Three Corpses]] living in everyone's body. The Sanshi keep track of the good deeds and particularly the bad deeds of the person they inhabit. Every 60 days, on the night called {{nihongo|''Kōshin-Machi''|庚申待}}, if the person sleeps, the Sanshi will leave the body and go to {{nihongo|''Ten-Tei''|天帝}}, the Heavenly God, to report about the deeds of that person. Ten-Tei will then decide to punish bad people, making them ill, shortening their time alive, and in extreme cases putting an end to their lives. Those believers of Kōshin who have reason to fear will try to stay awake during Kōshin nights. This is the only way to prevent the Sanshi from leaving their body and reporting to Ten-Tei.

An ancient representation of the "no see, no hear, no say, no do" can be found in four golden figurines in the [[Zelnik Istvan Southeast Asian Gold Museum]]. These golden statues date from the 6th to 8th century. The figures look like tribal human people with not very precise body carvings and strong phallic symbols.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zelnik-collection.com Cultures and Civilisations in Southeast Asia]. Private museum in Budapest, Hungary.{{Failed verification|date=December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This set indicates that the philosophy comes from very ancient roots.

It is not clear how or when the saying travelled; in Ethiopia the [[Ge'ez language]] has the saying "Let the eye fast, let the mouth fast, let the ears fast."&lt;ref&gt;Afeworq Tareqeny. 2008 (Ethiopian calendar). ''Anəggarä məsale zägə'əz''. Addis Ababa. p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Meaning of the proverb ==
[[File:Three Wise Monkeys (2010).jpg|thumb|right|220px|Three wise monkeys on the beach in Barcelona]]
Just as there is disagreement about the origin of the phrase, there are differing explanations of the meaning of "see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil".
* In Buddhist tradition, the tenets of the proverb are about not dwelling on evil thoughts.
* In the Western world both the proverb and the image are often used to refer to a lack of moral responsibility on the part of people who refuse to acknowledge impropriety, [[turning a blind eye|looking the other way]] or feigning ignorance.&lt;ref name="Olesen"&gt;{{cite news|title=How about monkey see, monkey DON'T do next time?|url=http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/opinion/columnists/how-about-monkey-see-monkey-dont-do-next-time-132842328.html|accessdate=25 July 2012|newspaper=Winnipeg Free Press|date=29 October 2011|author=Tom Oleson}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* It may also signify a [[code of silence]] in gangs, or [[organized crime]].

== Variations ==
Sometimes there is a fourth monkey depicted, '''Shizaru''', who symbolizes the principle of "do no evil", which fits with the full quote from [[Analects of Confucius]]. The monkey may be shown crossing his arms or covering his genitals. Yet another variation has the fourth monkey hold its nose to avoid a stench and has been dubbed "smell no evil" accordingly.&lt;ref name=searching/&gt;

=== Rajneesh movement ===

According to Osho [[Rajneesh]], the monkey symbolism originated in ancient Hindu tradition and Buddhist monks spread this symbolism across Asia. The original Hindu and Buddhist version has four monkeys and the fourth monkey covers his genitals.The Buddhist version means this as "Don't do anything evil".

In Hindu original version the meaning of the fourth monkey is totally different from the popular Buddhist version. It means, "Hide your pleasures. Hide your enjoyment, don't show it to anybody."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oshorajneesh.com/download/osho-books/zen/I_Celebrate_Myself.pdf|title=I Celebrate Myself: God Is No Where: Life Is Now Here|last=Osho|first=Chandra Mohan Jain|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Osho Rajneesh gave his own meaning regarding this. The first monkey denotes 'Don't listen to the truth because it will disturb all your consoling lies'. The second monkey denotes 'Don't look at the truth; otherwise your God will be dead and your heaven and hell will disappear'. The third monkey denotes 'Don't speak the truth, otherwise you will be condemned, crucified, poisoned, tortured by the whole crowd, the unconscious people. The fourth monkey denotes "Keep your pleasures, your joys, hidden. Don't let anybody know that you are a cheerful man, a blissful man, an ecstatic man, because that will destroy your very life. It is dangerous".&lt;ref&gt;Osho on zen. "I celebrate myself: God is no where, Life is now here". Chapter 1: The grand Rebellion. Question 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Three wise monkeys figure.JPG|thumb|220px|right| Brass casting]]
The three wise monkeys, and the associated proverb, are known throughout [[Asia]] and in the [[Western world]]. They have been a motif in pictures, such as the [[ukiyo-e]] (Japanese woodblock printings) by [[Keisai Eisen]], and are frequently represented in modern culture.

[[Mahatma Gandhi]]'s one notable exception to his lifestyle of non-possession was a small statue of the three monkeys - Bapu, Ketan and Bandar. Today, a larger representation of the three monkeys is prominently displayed at the [[Sabarmati Ashram]] in [[Ahmedabad]], [[Gujarat]], where Gandhi lived from 1915 to 1930 and from where he departed on his famous [[Salt Satyagraha|salt march]]. Gandhi's statue also inspired a 2008 artwork by Subodh Gupta, ''[[Gandhi's Three Monkeys]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.qatar-tribune.com/data/20120528/content.asp?section=nation1_5|title=QMA unveils Gandhi's 'Three Monkeys' at Katara|work=[[Qatar Tribune]]|date=28 May 2012|accessdate=21 June 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120606062409/http://www.qatar-tribune.com/data/20120528/content.asp?section=nation1_5|archivedate=6 June 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The three monkeys are depicted in the trial scene in the 1968 ''[[Planet of the Apes]]''. An example of semiotics, as the judges mimic the see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil monkeys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0063442/trivia|title=Planet of the Apes (1968)|author=|date=|publisher=|accessdate=4 April 2018|via=www.imdb.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The maxim inspired an award-winning 2008 Turkish film by director [[Nuri Bilge Ceylan]] called ''[[Three Monkeys]]'' (''Üç Maymun'').
&lt;!-- Many album covers and other media refer to the monkeys or the proverb—too many to mention. Please don't add these here. See talk page section "Trivia section of epic proportions". --&gt;

The '''Uma Baka'''' tribe were originally from the rural center of [[Borneo]] Island.

==History==
Over time, various historians and scholars have had differing ideas about the origins of this concept.  One viewpoint is expressed in the 2007 book ''Islamic Imperialism: A History,'' in which the author [[Efraim Karsh]] explains his belief of the concept's origin:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Karsh|first=Efraim|title=Islamic Imperialism: A History|year=2007|page=64|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0300122633}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|As a universal religion, Islam envisages a global political order in which all humankind will live under Muslim rule as either believers or subject communities. In order to achieve this goal it is incumbent on all free, male, adult Muslims to carry out an uncompromising struggle "in the path of Allah", or jihad. This in turn makes those parts of the world that have not yet been conquered by the House of Islam an abode of permanent conflict (''Dar al-Harb'', the "house of war") which will only end with Islam's eventual triumph.}}

'''Zayd ibn Harithah''' ({{lang-ar|زيد بن حارثة}}) (c. 581 – 629 CE), also known as '''Zayd ibn Muhammad''', was a [[sahaba|companion]] of [[Muhammad]] who was at one stage regarded as his (adoptive) son. He is the only companion who is mentioned by name in the [[Qur'an]] ({{cite quran|33|37|style=nosup|expand=no}}).{{citation needed|reason=Source given does not state that they are the only directly mentioned Muslims|date=January 2018}}

==Childhood==

Zayd is said to have been ten years younger than Muhammad, suggesting a birth-year of c. 581 A.D.. He is also said to have been 55 (lunar) years old at his death in 629, indicating a birthdate of 576.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

He was born into the Udhra branch of the [[Banu Kalb|Kalb]] tribe in the [[Najd]] (central) [[Arabia]]; he claimed a pedigree twelfth in descent from Udhra ibn Zayd al-Lat ibn Rufayda ibn Thawr ibn Kalb ibn Wabara.&lt;ref name="Landau-Tasseron/Tabari p. 6"&gt;Landau-Tasseron/Tabari p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lecker, p. 773.&lt;/ref&gt; Zayd's mother, Suda bint Thaalaba, was from the Maan branch of the [[Tayy]] tribe.&lt;ref name="Landau-Tasseron/Tabari p. 6"&gt;Landau-Tasseron/Tabari p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

When Zayd was "a young boy of an age at which he could be a servant"&lt;ref&gt;Muhammad ibn Saad, ''Tabaqat'', vol. 3. Translated by Bewley, A. (2013). ''The Companions of Badr'', p. 28. London: Ta-Ha Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; he accompanied his mother on a visit to her family. While they were staying with the Maan tribe, horsemen from the [[Banu al-Qayn|Qayn]] tribe raided their tents and kidnapped Zayd. They took him to the market at Ukkaz and sold him as a slave for 400 ''dinars ''.&lt;ref name="Landau-Tasseron/Tabari p. 6"/&gt;

Zayd's family searched for him, but without success. A lament is attributed to his father, Harithah ibn Sharahil:

&lt;poem&gt;''I weep for Zayd, not knowing what became of him.''
''Is he alive, is he to be expected, or has Death come over him?''
''By God, I ask yet do not comprehend.''
''Was it the plain or the mountain that brought about your end?''
''I wish that I knew: Will you ever return?''
''In this world only for your coming back I yearn.''
''The sun reminds me of him when it dawns, evoking his memory as the dusk falls.''
''When the winds blow, they stir up memories like dust.''
''O how long my sorrow and fear for him last!''&lt;ref&gt;Landau-Tasseron/Tabari pp. 6-7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;

==Slavery in Mecca==

Zaid was purchased by a merchant of [[Mecca]], [[Hakim ibn Hizam]], who gave the boy as a present to his aunt, [[Khadijah bint Khuwaylid]]. He remained in her possession until the day she married Muhammad , when she gave the slave as a wedding present to her bridegroom. Muhammad became very attached to Zaid, to whom he referred as ''al-Habib'' ("the beloved").&lt;ref name="Landau-Tasseron/Tabari p. 6"/&gt;

Some years later, some members of Zaid's tribe happened to arrive in Mecca on pilgrimage. They encountered Zaid and recognised each other, and he asked them to take a message home. 

{{poemquote|''Carry a message from me to my people,''

On receiving this message, Zaid's father and uncle immediately set out for Mecca. They found Muhammad at the [[Kaaba]] and promised him any ransom if he would return Zaid to them. Muhammad replied that Zaid should be allowed to choose his fate, but that if he wished to return to his family, Muhammad would release him without accepting any ransom in exchange. They called for Zaid, who easily recognised his father and uncle, but told them that he did not want to leave Muhammad, "for I have seen something in this man, and I am not the kind of person who would ever choose anyone in preference to him." At this, Muhammad took Zaid to the steps of the Kaaba, where legal contracts were agreed and witnessed, and announced to the crowds: "Witness that Zaid becomes my son, with mutual rights of inheritance." On seeing this, Zaid's father and uncle "were satisfied," and they returned home without him.&lt;ref&gt;Landau-Tasseron/Tabari pp. 8-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

In accordance with the Arabic custom of adoption at the time, Zayd was thereafter known as "Zayd ibn Muhammad" and was a freedman, regarded socially and legally as Muhammad's son.&lt;ref name="Landau-Tasseron/Tabari p. 9"&gt;Landau-Tasseron/Tabari p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conversion to Islam==

At an unknown date before 610, Zayd accompanied Muhammad to [[Ta'if]], where it was a tradition to sacrifice meat to the idols. Near Baldah on their way back to Mecca, they met [[Zayd ibn Amr]] and offered him some of the cooked meat that Zayd was carrying in their bag.&lt;ref name="Guillaume (1960)"&gt;Muhammad ibn Ishaq, via Yunus ibn Bukayr, cited in [https://books.google.com.au/books?id=tNHnAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PP1&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=Alfred+Guillaume+New+Light+on+the+Life+of+Muhammad&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=M6a5jt7Vuo&amp;sig=BHjwDdrjhNcwzuH98bpr-2DkPxU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiH_IO_qOrLAhWIg6YKHfwnC1UQ6AEIJTAD#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Guillaume, A.

Translated by Guillaume, A. (1955). ''The Life of Muhammad'', p. 99. Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; replied, "I do not eat anything which you slaughter in the name of your stone idols. I eat none but those things on which Allah's Name has been mentioned at the time of slaughtering."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/hadith/bukhari/058-sbt.php/ Bukhari 5:58:169.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170519212010/http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/hadith/bukhari/058-sbt.php |date=2017-05-19 }} [http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/hadith/bukhari/067-sbt.php/ Bukhari 7:67:407.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161017163327/http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/hadith/bukhari/067-sbt.php |date=2016-10-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After this encounter, said Muhammad, "I never stroked an idol of theirs, nor did I sacrifice to them, until God honoured me with his apostleship."&lt;ref name="Guillaume (1960)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kister (1970)"/&gt;

When Muhammad reported in 610 that he had received a revelation from the angel [[Gabriel]], Zayd was one of the first [[Conversion to Islam|converts to Islam]]. While Khadijah was the first [[Muslim]] of all,&lt;ref&gt;Guillaume/Ishaq p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt; she was closely followed by her neighbour [[Lubaba bint al-Harith]],&lt;ref&gt;Landau-Tasseron/Tabari p. 201.&lt;/ref&gt; her four daughters,&lt;ref&gt;Muhammad ibn Saad, ''Tabaqat'', vol. 8. Translated by Bewley, A. (1995). ''The Women of Madina'', pp. 21, 25-26. London: Ta-Ha Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Identity of the first male Muslim|first male converts]], [[Ali]], Zayd and [[Abu Bakr]].&lt;ref&gt;Guillaume/Ishaq pp. 114-115.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Hijra==

In 622, Zayd joined the other Muslims in the ''[[Hijra (Islam)|Hijra]]'' to [[Medina]]. Once settled in the new city, Muhammad urged each Muslim to "take a brother in Religion" so that each would have an ally in the community. Zayd was paired with Muhammad's uncle [[Hamza ibn 'Abd al-Muttalib|Hamza]]. Hamza accordingly trusted his last testament to Zayd just before his death in 625.&lt;ref&gt;Guillaume/Ishaq p. 234.&lt;/ref&gt;

A few months later, Muhammad and Abu Bakr sent Zayd back to Mecca to escort their families to Medina. The return party consisted of Muhammad's wife [[Sawda bint Zamʿa|Sawda]], his daughters [[Umm Kulthum bint Muhammad|Umm Kulthum]] and [[Fatimah]], his servant Abu Rafi, Zayd's wife [[Umm Ayman (Barakah)|Baraka]] and their son [[Usama ibn Zayd|Usama]], Abu Bakr's wife [[Umm Rumman]], his children [[Asmā' bint Abu Bakr|Asma]], [[Abdullah ibn Abi Bakr|Abdullah]] and [[Aisha bint Abi Bakr|Aisha]], and a guide named Abdullah ibn Urayqit; and Abu Bakr's kinsman [[Talhah]] also decided to accompany them.&lt;ref&gt;Landau-Tasseron/Tabari pp. 171-172.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marriages and Children==
Zayd married at least six times.
# Durrah (Fakhita) bint Abi Lahab, a cousin of Muhammad.&lt;ref name="Bewley/Saad vol. 3 p. 32"&gt;Bewley/Saad vol. 3 p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; They were divorced; the dates are unknown, but Durrah's two brothers were divorced from Muhammad's two daughters in 613.&lt;ref&gt;Bewley/Saad vol. 8 pp. 24-26.&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[Umm Ayman (Barakah)]], Muhammad's freedwoman. They were married "after Islam"&lt;ref&gt;Bewley/Saad vol. 8 p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt; and their son was born in 612.&lt;ref name="Landau-Tasseron/Tabari p. 65"&gt;Landau-Tasseron/Tabari p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt;
# Hind bint Al-Awwam, a niece of Khadijah.&lt;ref name="Bewley/Saad vol. 3 p. 32"/&gt;
# Humayma bint Sayfi (Umm Mubashshir), the widow of Al-Baraa ibn Maarur,&lt;ref&gt;Bewley/Saad vol. 8 pp. 264, 295-296.&lt;/ref&gt; a chief in Medina. Al-Baraa died in August or September 622,&lt;ref&gt;Bewley/Saad vol. 3 p. 481.&lt;/ref&gt; so the marriage to Zayd was presumably in or after 623.
# [[Zaynab bint Jahsh]], a cousin of Muhammad. They were married in 625 and divorced in late 626.&lt;ref&gt;Bewley/Saad vol. 8 pp. 72-73.&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[Umm Kulthum bint Uqba]], a maternal sister of Caliph [[Uthman ibn Affan|Uthman]]. This marriage was ordered by Muhammad in 628, but it ended in divorce.&lt;ref name="Bewley/Saad vol. 3 p. 32"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bewley/Saad vol. 8 p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt;

Zayd had three children.
# [[Usama ibn Zayd|Usama]], son of [[Umm Ayman (Barakah)|Barakah]], who had descendants, but their number "never exceeded twenty in any given generation."&lt;ref name="Landau-Tasseron/Tabari p. 65"/&gt;
# Zayd, son of Umm Kulthum, who died in infancy.&lt;ref name="Bewley/Saad vol. 3 p. 32"/&gt;
# Ruqayya, daughter of Umm Kulthum, who died while under the care of Uthman.&lt;ref name="Bewley/Saad vol. 3 p. 32"/&gt;

===Marriage to Zaynab bint Jahsh===

Around 625 Muhammad proposed that his cousin, Zaynab bint Jahsh, should marry Zayd. At first she refused on the grounds that she was of the [[Quraysh tribe|Quraysh]].&lt;ref&gt;Landau-Tasseron/Tabari p. 180.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that differences between Zaynab's social status and Zayd's were precisely the reason why Muhammad wanted to arrange the marriage:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Prophet was well aware that it is a person's standing in the eyes of Allah that is important, rather than his or her status in the eyes of the people ... their marriage would demonstrate that it was not who their ancestors were, but rather their standing in the sight of Allah, that mattered.{{dead link|date=July 2017}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.islamawareness.net/Muhammed/ibn_kathir_wives.html/ |title=Thomson, A. (2012). "Zaynab bint Jahsh" in ''Wives of the Prophet Muhammad (SAW)''. |access-date=2013-07-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130802065553/http://www.islamawareness.net/Muhammed/ibn_kathir_wives.html |archive-date=2013-08-02 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=July 2017}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

By contrast, [[William Montgomery Watt|Montgomery Watt]] points out that Zayd was high in Muhammad's esteem.

&lt;blockquote&gt;She can hardly have thought that he was not good enough. She was an ambitious woman, however, and may already have hoped to marry Muhammad; or she may have wanted to marry someone with whom Muhammad did not want his family to be so closely allied.&lt;ref&gt;Watt, W. M. (1956). ''Muhammad at Medina'', p. 331. Oxford: The Clarendon Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

When Muhammad announced a new verse of the Qur'an,{{cite quran|33|36|style=nosup|expand=no}},

{{quote|It is not fitting for a Believer, man or woman, when a matter has been decided by Allah and His Messenger to have any option about their decision: if any one disobeys Allah and His Messenger, he is indeed on a clearly wrong Path,|''Sura al-Ahzab'' Quran 33:36 (Translated by Yusuf Ali)}}

Zaynab acquiesced and married Zayd.&lt;ref&gt;Ibn Hisham note 918.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Al-Jalalayn, ''Tafsir'' on Q33:36-38.&lt;/ref&gt;

The marriage lasted less than two years.&lt;ref&gt;Ismail ibn Kathir, ''Al-Sira Al-Nabawiyya''. Translated by Le Gassick, T. (2000). ''The Life of the Prophet'', p. 198. Reading, U.K.: Garnet Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Ibn Sa`d]] and [[al-Tabari]] 

&lt;blockquote&gt;Zayd bin Harithah, who lived in Muhammad's household and came to be regarded as his adoptive son-so that he was regularly addressed as Zayd, son of Muhammad. Whether the marriage between Zayd and Zaynab was a mesalliance from the beginning is speculation, though the account maintains that Zayd was not reluctant to divorce his wife and allow her to marry Muhammad. Muhammad is portrayed as reluctant to proceed with the marriage because of scruples about whether marrying one's adopted son's former wife violated the prohibited degrees of marriage. Arab customary practice recognized kinship relations not based on blood ties: fosterage (having nursed from the same woman) was one such relationship; the question whether adoption fell into this category must have been unclear among Muslims. The marriage did not take place until after a Qur'anic revelation was received, giving permission for believers to marry the divorced wives of their adopted sons.&lt;ref name="Ṭabarī1997"&gt;{{cite book |author1= Ṭabarī |author2= MICHAEL FISHBEIN |title= The History of al-Tabari Vol. 8: The Victory of Islam: Muhammad at Medina A.D. 626-630/A.H. 5-8 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=NrrjCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR4 |date= January 1997 |publisher= State University of New York Press, Albany, NY www.sunypress.edu |isbn= 978-0-7914-3149-8 |page=xii |id= ([http://kalamullah.com/Books/The%20History%20Of%20Tabari/Tabari_Volume_08.pdf pdf link])}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Abolition of Adoption===

After these events, the traditional Arab form of adoption was no longer recognized in Islam; it was replaced by ''[[Islamic adoptional jurisprudence|kafala]]''. Three verses of the Qur'an were written about this. Al-Tabari states that Q33:40 was revealed because "the Munafiqun made this a topic of their conversation and reviled the Prophet, saying 'Muhammad prohibits [marriage] with the [former] wives of one's own sons, but he married the [former] wife of his son Zayd.'"&lt;ref name="Landau-Tasseron/Tabari p. 9"/&gt;

{{quote|Muhammad is not the father of any of your men, but (he is) the Messenger of Allah, and the Seal of the Prophets: and Allah has full knowledge of all things.|''Sura al-Ahzab'' Quran 33:40 (Translated by Yusuf Ali)}}

Zayd reverted to being known by his original name of Zayd ibn Harithah and was no longer considered Muhammad's legal son after the revelation of Q33:5:&lt;ref&gt;Landau-Tasseron/Tabari pp. 9-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Call them by their fathers' names ...|''Sura al-Ahzab'' Quran 33:5 (Translated by Yusuf Ali)}}

Ibn Saad indicates that Q33:37 was a specific instruction to Muhammad and Zaynab to marry and that it explains why their marriage was necessary.&lt;ref&gt;Bewley/Saad vol. 8 pp. 73-75.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Behold! Thou didst say to one who had received the grace of Allah and thy favour: "Retain thou (in wedlock) thy wife, and fear Allah." But thou didst hide in thy heart that which Allah was about to make manifest: thou didst fear the people, but it is more fitting that thou shouldst fear Allah. Then when Zaid had dissolved (his marriage) with her, with the necessary (formality), We joined her in marriage to thee: in order that (in future) there may be no difficulty to the Believers in (the matter of) marriage with the wives of their adopted sons, when the latter have dissolved with the necessary (formality) (their marriage) with them. And Allah's command must be fulfilled.|''Sura al-Ahzab'' Quran 33:37 (Translated by Yusuf Ali)}}

==Death==
Zayd ibn Harithah led his final expedition in September 629 C.E. A Muslim force of 3,000 men set out to raid the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] city of [[Bosra]]. However, a Byzantine force of "100,000 Greeks joined by 100,000 men from Lakhm and Judham and Al-Qayn and [[Bahra (tribe)|Bahra']] and Bali"&lt;ref&gt;Guillaume/Ishaq p. 532.&lt;/ref&gt;  intercepted them at a village called Mu'tah. Zayd held the standard at the [[Battle of Mu'tah]] until he was struck down by a spear-thrust&lt;ref name="Bewley/Saad vol. 3 p. 33"&gt;Bewley/Saad vol. 3 p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; and he bled to death.&lt;ref&gt;Guillaume/Ishaq p. 534.&lt;/ref&gt; The other two leaders, [[Ja`far ibn Abī Tālib]] and [[`Abd Allah ibn Rawahah]], were also killed, and the Muslim army was routed.&lt;ref&gt;Guillaume/Ishaq pp. 534-535.&lt;/ref&gt;

On hearing of Zayd's death, Muhammad went to the family. "The daughter of Zayd wept before the Messenger of Allah and the Messenger of Allah wept until he sobbed. [[Sa'd ibn Ubadah|Saad ibn Ubada]] said, 'Messenger of Allah, what is this?' He answered, 'This is the yearning of the lover for the beloved.'"&lt;ref name="Bewley/Saad vol. 3 p. 33"/&gt;
