[[Image:HardyTreasonTrials.png|thumb|right|[[Thomas Hardy (political reformer)|Thomas Hardy's]] account of the trials (second edition)]]
The '''1794 Treason Trials''', arranged by the administration of [[William Pitt the Younger|William Pitt]], were intended to cripple the [[Radicalism (historical)#United Kingdom|British radical movement of the 1790s]]. Over thirty radicals were initially arrested; three were tried for [[High treason in the United Kingdom|high treason]]: [[Thomas Hardy (political reformer)|Thomas Hardy]], [[John Horne Tooke]] and [[John Thelwall]]. In a repudiation of the government's policies, they were [[acquittal|acquitted]] by three separate [[jury|juries]] in November 1794 to great public rejoicing. The treason trials were an extension of the [[sedition]] trials of 1792 and 1793 against parliamentary reformers in both England and Scotland.

==Historical context==
The historical backdrop to the Treason Trials is complex: it involves not only the British parliamentary reform efforts of the 1770s and 1780s but also the [[French Revolution]]. In the 1770s and 1780s, there was an effort among liberal-minded [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Members of Parliament]] to reform the [[British electoral system]]. A disproportionately small number of electors voted for MPs and many seats were simply bought. [[Christopher Wyvill]] and [[William Pitt the Younger]] argued for additional seats to be added to the House of Commons and the [[Charles Lennox, 3rd Duke of Richmond|Duke of Richmond]] and [[John Cartwright (political reformer)|John Cartwright]] advocated a more radical reform: "the payment of MPs, an end to corruption and patronage in parliamentary elections, annual parliaments (partly to enable the speedy removal of corrupt MPs) and, preeminently and most controversially, universal manhood suffrage".&lt;ref&gt;Barrell and Mee, "Introduction", x.&lt;/ref&gt; Both efforts failed and the reform movement appeared moribund in the mid-1780s.

Once the revolution in France began to demonstrate the power of popular agitation, the [[Radicalism (historical)#United Kingdom|British reform movement]] was reinvigorated. Much of the vigorous political debate in the 1790s in Britain was sparked by the publication of [[Edmund Burke|Edmund Burke's]] ''[[Reflections on the Revolution in France]]'' (1790). Surprising his friends and enemies alike, Burke, who had supported the [[American Revolution]], criticized the French Revolution and the British radicals who had welcomed its early stages. While the radicals saw the revolution as analogous to Britain's own [[Glorious Revolution]] in 1688, which had restricted the powers of the [[monarchy]], Burke argued that the appropriate historical analogy was the [[English Civil War]] (1642–1651) in which [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] had been executed in 1649. He viewed the French Revolution as the violent overthrow of a legitimate government. In ''Reflections'' he argues that citizens do not have the right to revolt against their government, because civilizations, including governments, are the result of social and political consensus. If a culture's traditions were challenged, the result would be endless anarchy. There was an immediate response from the British supporters of the French revolution, most notably [[Mary Wollstonecraft]] in her ''[[Vindication of the Rights of Men]]'' and [[Thomas Paine]] in his ''[[Rights of Man]]''. In this lively and sometimes vicious pamphlet war, now referred to as the "[[Revolution Controversy]]", British political commentators addressed topics ranging from representative government to human rights to the separation of church and state.&lt;ref&gt;Butler, "Introductory Essay"; Barrell and Mee, "Introduction", xi–xii.&lt;/ref&gt;

1792 was the "''[[annus mirabilis]]'' of eighteenth-century radicalism": its most important texts, such as ''Rights of Man'', were published and the influence of the radical associations was at its height. In fact, it was as a result of the publication of the ''Rights of Man'' that such associations began to proliferate.&lt;ref&gt;Butler, "Introductory essay," 7; see also Barrell and Mee, "Introduction", xii.&lt;/ref&gt; The most significant groups, made up of artisans, merchants and others from the middling and lower sorts, were the [[Sheffield Society for Constitutional Information]], the [[London Corresponding Society]] (LCS) and the [[Society for Constitutional Information]] (SCI).&lt;ref&gt;Barrell and Mee, "Introduction", xii.&lt;/ref&gt; But it was not until these groups formed an alliance with the more genteel [[Friends of the People Society|Society of the Friends of the People]] that the government became concerned. When this sympathy became known, the government issued a [[Royal Proclamation Against Seditious Writings and Publications|royal proclamation against seditious writings]] on 21 May 1792. In a dramatic increase compared to the rest of the century, there were over 100 prosecutions for sedition in the 1790s alone.&lt;ref&gt;Barrell and Mee, "Introduction", xiii.&lt;/ref&gt; The British government, fearing an uprising similar to the French Revolution, took even more drastic steps to quash the radicals. They made an increasing number of political arrests and infiltrated the radical groups; they threatened to "revoke the licences of publicans who continued to host politicized debating societies and to carry reformist literature"; they seized the mail of "suspected dissidents"; and they supported groups that disrupted radical events and attacked radicals in the press.&lt;ref&gt;Keen, 54.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the British Government initiated the [[Aliens Act 1793|Aliens Act of 1793]] in order to regulate the entrance of immigrants into Great Britain. Essentially, the Aliens Act enforced that aliens be recorded upon arrival and register with the local justice of the peace. Specifically, immigrants were required to give their names, ranks, occupations, and addresses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The 1905 Aliens Act {{!}} History Today|url = http://www.historytoday.com/anne-kershen/1905-aliens-act|website = www.historytoday.com|accessdate = 2015-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, the Aliens Act reduced the number of immigrants into Great Britain out of fear that one of them may be an unwanted spy. Radicals saw this period as "the institution of a system of terror, almost as hideous in its features, almost as gigantic in its stature, and infinitely more pernicious in its tendency, than France ever knew".&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in Barrell and Mee, "Introduction", xxi.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prelude: Trials of Thomas Paine, John Frost and Daniel Isaac Eaton==

===Thomas Paine===
{{main|Trial of Thomas Paine}}
[[Image:Thomas Paine.jpg|thumb|right|[[Thomas Paine]]; a painting by [[Auguste Millière]] (1880), after an engraving by [[William Sharp (engraver)|William Sharp]] after a portrait by [[George Romney (painter)|George Romney]] (1792)]]
The administration did not immediately begin to prosecute all of its detractors after the proclamation against seditious writings was issued. Although [[Thomas Paine|Paine's]] publisher, [[J. S. Jordan]], was indicted for sedition for publishing the ''[[Rights of Man]]'' in May 1792, Paine himself was not charged until the royal proclamation was promulgated. Even then, the government did not actively pursue him, apart from spying on him and continuing its propaganda campaign against "Mad Tom". Paine's trial was delayed until December and he fled to France in the intervening months, apparently with the government's blessing, which was more interested in getting rid of such a troublesome citizen than trying him in person. Moreover, afraid that Paine might use his trial as a political platform, the government may not have wanted to prosecute Paine personally.&lt;ref&gt;Barrell and Mee, "Introduction", xviii.&lt;/ref&gt;

When the trial finally took place on 18 December 1792, its outcome was a foregone conclusion. The government, under Pitt's direction, had been lambasting Paine in the papers for months and the trial judge had negotiated the prosecution's arguments with them ahead of time. The radical [[Thomas Erskine, 1st Baron Erskine|Thomas Erskine]] defended Paine by arguing that his pamphlet was part of an honorable English tradition of political philosophy that included the writings of [[John Milton]], [[John Locke]] and [[David Hume]]; he also pointed out that Paine was merely responding to the philosophical work of an MP, Burke. The Attorney-General argued that the pamphlet was clearly aimed at readers "whose minds cannot be supposed to be conversant with subjects of this sort" and cited its cheap price as evidence of its lack of serious intent.&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in Barrell and Mee, "Introduction", xix.&lt;/ref&gt; The prosecution did not even have to rebut Erskine's arguments; the jury informed the judge they had already decided Paine was guilty.&lt;ref&gt;Barrell and Mee, "Introduction", xix.&lt;/ref&gt;

===John Frost===
[[John Frost (republican)|John Frost]] was a member of the SCI, a former associate of Pitt, an attorney and a friend of Paine's. On 6 November 1792 he got involved in a dispute with a friend over the French revolution in a tavern and was heard to say "Equality, and No King". This dispute was reported by publicans to government informers. When Frost went to Paris later that month, the government declared him an outlaw and encouraged him to stay in France. Frost, challenging the government to act, returned and surrendered himself to the authorities. Suggestions began to float around, from government and radical sources alike, that the government was embarrassed to prosecute Frost because of his former friendship with Pitt. But on 27 May, he was brought to trial for sedition. Erskine defended Frost, arguing that there was no seditious intent to his statement, his client was drunk, he was in a heated argument, and he was in a private space (the tavern). The Attorney-General contended that Frost "was a man whose seditious intent was carried with him wherever he went".&lt;ref&gt;Barrell and Mee, "Introduction", xx.&lt;/ref&gt; The jury convicted him.

===Daniel Isaac Eaton===
[[Daniel Isaac Eaton]], the publisher of the popular periodical ''[[Politics for the People]]'', was arrested on 7 December 1793 for publishing a statement by [[John Thelwall]], a radical lecturer and debater. Thelwall had made a speech that included an anecdote about a tyrannical gamecock named "King Chanticleer" who was beheaded for its despotism and Eaton reprinted it. Eaton was imprisoned for three months before his trial in an effort to bankrupt him and his family. In February 1794, he was finally brought to trial and defended by John Gurney&lt;!--do not link - there is no page for this John Gurney--&gt;. Gurney argued that the comment was an indictment of tyranny in general or of [[Louis XVI]], the king of France, and announced his dismay that anyone could think that the author meant [[George III]]. "Gurney went so far as to cheekily suggest that it was the Attorney-General who was guilty of [[seditious libel]]; by supplying those innuendos he, not Eaton or Thelwall, had represented George III as a tyrant."&lt;ref&gt;Barrell and Mee, "Introduction", xx–xxii.&lt;/ref&gt; Everyone laughed uproariously and Eaton was acquitted; the membership of the radical societies skyrocketed.

==Treason Trials of 1794==
[[Image:John Horne Tooke.jpg|left|thumb|[[John Horne Tooke]]]]
The radical societies were briefly enjoying an upsurge in membership and influence. In the summer of 1793 several of them decided to convene in [[Edinburgh]] to decide on how to summon "a great Body of the People" to convince Parliament to reform, since it did not seem willing to reform itself. The government viewed this assembly as an attempt to set up an anti-parliament. In Scotland, three leaders of the convention were tried for sedition and sentenced to fourteen years of service in [[Botany Bay]]. Such harsh sentences shocked the nation and while initially the societies believed that an insurrection might be necessary to resist such an overbearing government, their  rhetoric never materialized into an actual armed rebellion.&lt;ref&gt;Barrell and Mee, "Introduction", xxiv–xxv.&lt;/ref&gt; Plans were made by some of the societies to meet again if the government became more hostile (e.g. if they [[habeas corpus|suspended ''habeas corpus'']]). In 1794, a plan was circulated to convene again, but it never got off the ground. The government, frightened however, arrested six members of the SCI and 13 members of the LCS on suspicion of "treasonable practices" in conspiring to assume "a pretended general convention of the people, in contempt and defiance of the authority of parliament, and on principles subversive of the existing laws and constitution, and directly tending to the introduction of that system of anarchy and confusion which has fatally prevailed in France".&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in Barrell and Mee, "Introduction", xxvii.&lt;/ref&gt; Over thirty men were arrested in all. Of the people arrested were [[Thomas Hardy (political reformer)|Thomas Hardy]], secretary of the LCS; the linguist [[John Horne Tooke]]; the novelist and dramatist [[Thomas Holcroft]] (arrested in October); the [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] minister [[Jeremiah Joyce]]; writer and lecturer [[John Thelwall]]; bookseller and pamphleteer [[Thomas Spence]]; and [[silversmith]] and, later, historian John Baxter&lt;!--don't link - there is no page for this John Baxter--&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Barrell and Mee, "Introduction", xxvii.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the arrests, the government formed two secret committees to study the papers they had seized from the radicals' houses. After the first committee report, the government introduced a bill in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] to suspend habeas corpus; thus, those arrested on suspicion of treason could be held without bail or charge until February 1795. In June 1794 the committee issued a second report, asserting that the radical societies had been planning at least to "over-awe" the sovereign and Parliament by the show of "a great Body of the People" if not to overthrow the government and install a French-style republic. They claimed that the societies had attempted to assemble a large armory for this purpose, but no evidence could be found for it, in the end.&lt;ref&gt;Barrell and Mee, "Introduction", xxviii.&lt;/ref&gt; They were eventually charged with an assortment of crimes, but [[seditious libel]] and [[treason]] were the most severe. The government propagated the notion that the radicals had committed a new kind of treason, what they called "modern" or "French" treason. While previous defendants had tried to replace one king with another from another dynasty, these democrats wanted to overthrow the entire monarchical system and remove the king entirely. "Modern French treason, it seemed, was different from, was worse than, old-fashioned English treason."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Barrell and Mee, "Introduction", xxxi.&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately for the prosecution, the treason statute, that of the [[Treason Act 1351|Act of Edward III from 1351]], did not apply very well to this new kind of treason. The Attorney-General [[John Scott, 1st Earl of Eldon|Sir John Scott]], who would prosecute Hardy and Horne Tooke, "decided to base the indictment on the charge that the societies had been engaged in a conspiracy to levy war against the king, that they intended to subvert the constitution, to depose the King, and put him to death; and for that purpose, and ''{{'}}with Force and Arms{{'}}'', they conspired to excite insurrection and rebellion" (emphasis in original).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Initially the men were confined to the [[Tower of London]], but they were eventually moved to [[Newgate prison]]. Those charged with treason faced the brutal punishment of [[hanging, drawing and quartering]] if convicted: each would have been "hanged by the neck, cut down while still alive, disembowelled (and his entrails burned before his face) and then beheaded and quartered".&lt;ref name="Thompson, 19"&gt;Thompson, 19.&lt;/ref&gt; The entire radical movement was also on trial; there were supposedly 800 warrants that were ready to be acted upon when the government won its case.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, 137.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Thomas Hardy===
[[Thomas Hardy (political reformer)|Hardy's]] trial was first; his wife had died while he was in prison, generating support for him among the populace.&lt;ref name="Thompson, 135"&gt;Thompson, 135.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Erskine, 1st Baron Erskine|Thomas Erskine]], defending again, argued that the radicals had proposed nothing more than the Duke of Richmond (now an anti-reformer) had in the 1780s and "their plan for a convention of delegates was borrowed from a similar plan advanced by Pitt himself".&lt;ref&gt;Barrell and Mee, "Introduction", xxxi–xxxii.&lt;/ref&gt; The government could provide no real evidence of an armed insurrection. The Attorney-General's opening statement lasted nine hours, leading the former Lord Chancellor Lord Thurlow to comment that "there was no treason".&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Qtd. in Barrell and Mee, "Introduction", xxxii.&lt;/ref&gt; Treason must be "clear and obvious"; the great legal theorist [[Edward Coke]] had argued that treason was to be determined "not upon conjecturall {{sic}} presumptions, or inferences, or strains of wit, but upon good and sufficient proof".&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Part of Erskine's effective defense was to dismiss the prosecution's case, as it was based on "strains of wit" or "imagination" (a play on words of the statute itself).&lt;ref&gt;Barrell and Mee, "Introduction", xxxii.&lt;/ref&gt; He claimed, as he had in the earlier trials, that it was the prosecution that was "imagining the king's death" rather than the defense. His cross-examination of the prosecution's spies also helped demolish their case; he "cross-examined these witnesses in a tone of contemptuous disbelief and managed to discredit much of their evidence".&lt;ref&gt;Barrell and Mee, "Introduction", xxxiv; Thompson, 135.&lt;/ref&gt; After a nine-day trial, which was exceptionally long for the time, he was acquitted.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;Barrell and Mee, "Introduction", xxxiv.&lt;/ref&gt; The foreman of the jury fainted after delivering his verdict of not guilty, and the crowd enthusiastically carried Hardy through the streets of London.&lt;ref name="Thompson, 19"/&gt;

In his speeches, Erskine emphasized that the radical organizations, primarily the [[London Corresponding Society]] and the [[Society for Constitutional Information]], were dedicated to a revolution of ideas, not a violent revolution—they embodied the new ideals of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]].&lt;ref&gt;Keen 164–165.&lt;/ref&gt; Erskine was helped in his defense by pamphlets such as [[William Godwin|William Godwin's]] ''Cursory Strictures on the Charge Delivered by Lord Chief Justice Eyre to the Grand Jury, 2 October 1794''.&lt;ref&gt;Butler, "Introductory essay", 198–199.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:BellTreasonTrials.png|right|thumb|Bell's transcript of the trials]]

===John Horne Tooke===
[[John Horne Tooke|John Horne Tooke's]] trial followed Hardy's, in which Pitt was forced to testify and admit that he had attended radical meetings himself.&lt;ref name="Thompson, 136"&gt;Thompson, 136.&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the trial Horne Tooke "combined the affectation of boredom with irreverent wit".&lt;ref name="Thompson, 135"/&gt; One observer noted that when asked by the court if he would be tried "by God and his Country", he "eyed the court for some seconds with an air of significancy few men are so well able to assume, and shaking his head, emphatically answered 'I ''would'' be tried by God and my country, ''but''—!{{'"}}&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in Thompson, 135.&lt;/ref&gt; After a long trial, he too was acquitted.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

All of the other members of the SCI were released after these two trials, as it became obvious to the government that they would not gain any convictions.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

===John Thelwall===
[[John Thelwall]] was tried last; the government felt forced to try him because the loyalist press had argued that his case was particularly strong.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; While awaiting trial, he wrote and published poetry indicting the entire process.&lt;ref name="Thompson, 136"/&gt; During Thelwall's trial, various members of the [[London Corresponding Society]] testified that Thelwall and the others had no concrete plans to overthrow the government, and that details of how reform was to be achieved were an "afterthought". This undermined the prosecution's claims that the society was responsible for fomenting rebellion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.johnthelwall.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Rhian-Jones-Talking-Treason-FINAL-REVISED-TEXT.pdf|title = Talking Treason? John Thelwall and the Privy Council Examinations of the English Jacobins, 1794|date = 2013|accessdate = |website = Thelwall Studies|publisher = John Thelwall Society|last = Jones|first = Rhian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thelwall was also acquitted, after which the rest of the cases were dismissed.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, 19; Barrell and Mee, "Introduction", xxxiv.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trial literature==
All of these trials, both those from 1792 and those from 1794, were published as part of an 18th-century genre called "trial literature". Often, multiple versions of famous trials would be published and since the shorthand takers were not always precise, the accounts disagree. Moreover, the accounts were sometimes altered deliberately by one side or another. Importantly, those in the courtroom knew that their words would be published. In Scotland, one of the accused ringleaders of the plot said: "What I say this day will not be confined within these walls, but will spread far and wide."&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in Barrell and Mee, "Introduction", xxxviii.&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, the government may have resisted trying Paine until he had left the country because of the notorious power of his pen.&lt;ref&gt;Barrell and Mee, "Introduction", xxxviii.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
[[File:Copenhagen house' (John Gale Jones; Joseph Priestley; William Hodgson; John Thelwell; Charles James Fox) by James Gillray.jpg|thumb|left|[[James Gillray|James Gillray's]] cartoon of Thelwall speaking at [[Copenhagen Fields]] on 26 October 1795]]
Although all of the defendants of the Treason Trials had been acquitted, the administration and the loyalists assumed they were guilty. Secretary at War [[William Windham]] referred to the radicals as "acquitted felon[s]" and [[William Pitt the Younger|William Pitt]] and the Attorney-General called them "morally guilty".&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in Barrell and Mee, "Introduction", xxxv.&lt;/ref&gt; There was widespread agreement that they got off because the treason statute was outdated. When, in October 1795, crowds threw refuse at the king and insulted him, demanding a cessation of the [[French Revolutionary Wars|war with France]] and lower bread prices, the Parliament immediately passed the "gagging acts" (the [[Seditious Meetings Act 1795|Seditious Meetings Act]] and the [[Treasonable Practices Act]], also known as the "Two Acts"). Under these new laws, it was almost impossible to have a public meeting and speech at such meetings was severely curtailed.&lt;ref&gt;Butler, ''Romantics'', 49; Thompson, 19; Barrell and Mee, "Introduction", xxxv; Keen, 54.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of these legislative acts, Societies that were not directly involved with the Treason Trials, like the [[Society of the Friends of the People]], disbanded.&lt;ref name=hampshermonk&gt;Iain Hampsher-Monk.

Journal of British Studies, 1979. {{jstor|175513}}. 24 November 2015. {{Subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; British "radicalism encountered a severe set-back" during these years, and it was not until a generation later that any real reform could be enacted.&lt;ref&gt;Butler, "Introductory essay," 3.&lt;/ref&gt; The trials, although they were not government victories, served the purpose for which they were intended—all of these men, except Thelwall, withdrew from active radical politics as did many others fearful of governmental retribution. Few took their place.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, 137-8.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16866">'''Three dimensional''' ('''3D''') '''bioprinting''' is the utilization of [[3D printing]] and 3D printing–like techniques to combine cells, growth factors, and [[biomaterial]]s to fabricate biomedical parts that maximally imitate natural tissue characteristics.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Singh|first=Deepti|last2=Thomas|first2=Daniel|date=2018-05-18|title=Advances in medical polymer technology towards the panacea of complex 3D tissue and organ manufacture|journal=American Journal of Surgery|doi=10.1016/j.amjsurg.2018.05.012|issn=1879-1883|pmid=29803500}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, 3D bioprinting utilizes the layer-by-layer method to deposit materials known as [[bioinks]] to create tissue-like structures that are later used in medical and tissue engineering fields.

==Process==
3D bioprinting generally follows three steps, pre-bioprinting, bioprinting, and post-bioprinting.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shafiee|first=Ashkan|last2=Atala|first2=Anthony|date=2016-03-01|title=Printing Technologies for Medical Applications|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1471491416000149|journal=Trends in Molecular Medicine|volume=22|issue=3|pages=254–265|doi=10.1016/j.molmed.2016.01.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ozbolat|first=Ibrahim T.|date=2015-07-01|title=Bioprinting scale-up tissue and organ constructs for transplantation|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167779915000967|journal=Trends in Biotechnology|volume=33|issue=7|pages=395–400|doi=10.1016/j.tibtech.2015.04.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pre-bioprinting ===
Pre-bioprinting is the process of creating a model that the printer will later create and choosing the materials that will be used. One of the first steps is to obtain a biopsy of the organ. Common technologies used for bioprinting are [[computed tomography]] (CT) and [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI). To print with a layer-by-layer approach, tomographic reconstruction is done on the images. The now-2D images are then sent to the printer to be made. Once the image is created, certain cells are isolated and multiplied.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; These cells are then mixed with a special liquefied material that provides oxygen and other nutrients to keep them alive. In some processes, the cells are encapsulated in cellular spheroids 500μm in diameter. This aggregation of cells does not require a scaffold, and are required for placing in the tubular-like tissue fusion for processes such as extrusion.&lt;ref name="ChuaBio14"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nhK3CgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover|title=Bioprinting: Principles and Applications|author1=Chua, C.K.|author2=Yeong, W.Y.|publisher=World Scientific Publishing Co|year=2015|isbn=9789814612104|location=Singapore|pages=296|accessdate=17 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|165}}

=== Bioprinting ===
In the second step, the liquid mixture of cells, matrix, and nutrients known as [[bioinks]] are placed in a printer cartridge and deposited using the patients' medical scans.&lt;ref name="cooper"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/03/01/3d-printed-organs-regenerative-medicine_n_6698606.html|title=How 3D Printing Could End The Deadly Shortage Of Donor Organs|date=1 March 2015|publisher=TheHuffingtonPost.com, Inc|author =Cooper-White, M.|work=Huffpost Science|accessdate=17 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; When a bioprinted pre-tissue is transferred to an incubator, this cell-based pre-tissue matures into a tissue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Thomas|first=Daniel J.|date=2016-01-01|title=Could 3D bioprinted tissues offer future hope for microtia treatment?|url=https://cronfa.swan.ac.uk/Record/cronfa29537|journal=International Journal of Surgery|language=en-gb|volume=32|pages=43–44|doi=10.1016/j.ijsu.2016.06.036}}&lt;/ref&gt;

3D  bioprinting for fabricating biological constructs typically involves dispensing cells onto a biocompatible scaffold using a successive layer-by-layer approach to generate tissue-like three-dimensional structures.&lt;ref name="harmon2013"&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://bioengineering.rice.edu/uploadedFiles/Bioengineering/The_Big_Picture/scientificamerican0413-54.pdf |format=PDF |title=A sweet solution for replacing organs |journal=Scientific American |author=Harmon, K. |volume=308 |issue=4 |pages=54–55 |year=2013 |doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0413-54 |accessdate=17 February 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160217174416/https://bioengineering.rice.edu/uploadedFiles/Bioengineering/The_Big_Picture/scientificamerican0413-54.pdf |archive-date=2016-02-17 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Artificial organs such as livers and kidneys made by 3D bioprinting have been shown to lack crucial elements that affect the body such as working blood vessels, tubules for collecting urine, and the growth of billions of cells required for these organs. Without these components the body has no way to get the essential nutrients and oxygen deep within their interiors.&lt;ref name="harmon2013" /&gt; Given that every tissue in the body is naturally composed of different cell types, many technologies for printing these cells vary in their ability to ensure stability and viability of the cells during the manufacturing process. Some of the methods that are used for 3D bioprinting of cells are [[photolithography]], magnetic bioprinting, [[stereolithography]], and direct cell extrusion.&lt;ref name="ChuaBio14" /&gt;{{rp|196}}

=== Post-bioprinting ===
The post-bioprinting process is necessary to create a stable structure from the biological material. If this process is not well-maintained, the mechanical integrity and function of the 3D printed object is at risk.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; To maintain the object, both mechanical and chemical stimulations are needed. These stimulations send signals to the cells to control the remodeling and growth of tissues. In addition, in recent development, bioreactor technologies&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; have allowed the rapid maturation of tissues, vascularization of tissues and the ability to survive transplants.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Bioreactors work in either providing convective nutrient transport, creating microgravity environments, changing the pressure causing solution to flow through the cells, or add compression for dynamic or static loading. Each type of bioreactor is ideal for different types of tissue, for example compression bioreactors are ideal for cartilage tissue.&lt;ref name="ChuaBio14" /&gt;{{rp|198}}

== Bioprinting approach ==
Researchers in the field have developed approaches to produce living organs that are constructed with the appropriate biological and mechanical properties. 3D bioprinting is based on three main approaches: Biomimicry, autonomous self-assembly and mini-tissue building blocks.&lt;ref name=Murphy&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.nature.com/nbt/journal/v32/n8/full/nbt.2958.html|title=3D bioprinting of tissues and organs|last=Murphy|first=Sean|authorlink=|last2=Atala|first2=Anthony|authorlink2=|date=August 5, 2014|website=Nature Biotechnology|publisher=|doi=10.1038/nbt.2958|pmid=25093879|volume=32|pages=773–85}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Biomimicry===
The first approach of bioprinting is called biomimicry. The main goal of this approach is to create fabricated structures that are identical to the natural structure that are found in the tissues and organs in the human body. Biomimicry requires duplication of the shape, framework, and the microenvironment of the organs and tissues.&lt;ref name=Yoo&gt;{{cite web|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1678889578|title=Bioprinting: 3D printing comes to life|last=Yoo|first=James|last2=Atala|first2=Anthony|year=2015|website=Manufacturing Engineering}}&lt;/ref&gt; The application of biomimicry in bioprinting involves creating both identical cellular and extracellular parts of organs. For this approach to be successful, the tissues must be replicated on a micro scale. Therefore, it is necessary to understand the microenvironment, the nature of the biological forces in this microenvironment, the precise organization of functional and supporting cell types, solubility factors, and the composition of extracellular matrix.&lt;ref name=Murphy/&gt;

===Autonomous self-assembly===
The second approach of bioprinting is autonomous self-assembly. This approach relies on the physical process of embryonic organ development as a model to replicate the tissues of interest.&lt;ref name=Yoo/&gt; When cells are in their early development, they create their own extracellular matrix building block, the proper cell signaling, and independent arrangement and patterning to provide the required biological functions and micro-architecture.&lt;ref name=Murphy/&gt; Autonomous self-assembly demands specific information about the developmental techniques of the tissues and organs of the embryo.&lt;ref name=Yoo/&gt; There is a "scaffold-free" model that uses self-assembling spheroids that subjects to fusion and cell arrangement to resemble evolving tissues. Autonomous self-assembly depends on the cell as the fundamental driver of histogenesis, guiding the building blocks, structural and functional properties of these tissues. It demands a deeper understanding of how embryonic tissues mechanisms develop as well as the microenvironment surrounded to create the bioprinted tissues.&lt;ref name=Murphy/&gt;

===Mini-tissue===
The third approach of bioprinting is a combination of both the biomimicry and self-assembly approaches, which is called mini tissues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2018-06-12|title=Novel techniques of engineering 3D vasculature tissue for surgical procedures|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002961018307621|journal=The American Journal of Surgery|language=en|doi=10.1016/j.amjsurg.2018.06.004|issn=0002-9610}}&lt;/ref&gt; Organs and tissues are built from very small functional components. Mini-tissue approach takes these small pieces and manufacture and arrange them into larger framework.&lt;ref name=Yoo/&gt;&lt;ref name=Murphy/&gt;

== Printers ==
Akin to ordinary ink printers, bioprinters have three major components to them. These are the hardware used, the type of bio-ink, and the material it is printed on (biomaterials).&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;
"Bio-ink is a material made from living cells that behaves much like a liquid, allowing people to "print" it in order to create a desired shape. To make bio-ink, scientists create a slurry of cells that can be loaded into a cartridge and inserted into a specially designed printer, along with another cartridge containing a gel known as bio-paper."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7cAqCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA417&amp;lpg=PA417 | title=Basic Dental Materials | publisher=JP Medical Ltd | author=John J Manappallil | year=2015 | isbn=9789352500482}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In bioprinting, there are three major types of printers that have been used. These are inkjet, laser-assisted, and extrusion printers. Inkjet printers are mainly used in bioprinting for fast and large-scale products. One type of inkjet printer, called drop-on-demand inkjet printer, prints materials in exact amounts, minimizing cost and waste.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=3D Printing Technology At The Service Of Health|url=http://www.healthyeve.com/3d-printing-technology-service-health/|accessdate=4 August 2016|work=healthyeve}}&lt;/ref&gt; Printers that utilize lasers provide high-resolution printing; however, these printers are often expensive. Extrusion printers print cells layer-by-layer, just like [[3D printing]] to create 3D constructs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zolfagharian|first=Ali|author2=Abbas Z. Kouzani |author3=Sui Yang Khoo |author4= Bijan Nasri-Nasrabadi |author5=  Akif Kaynak |year=2017|title=Development and analysis of a 3D printed hydrogel soft actuator|journal=Sensors and Actuators A: Physical|publisher=ScienceDirect|volume=265|doi =10.1016/j.sna.2017.08.038}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Conferrence|last=Zolfagharian|first=Ali|author2=Abbas Z. Kouzani |author3=Sui Yang Khoo |author4= Ian Gibson |author5=  Akif Kaynak |year=2017|title= 3D printed hydrogel soft actuators|Proceedings=In Region 10 Conference (TENCON)|publisher=IEEE|pp. 2272-2277. IEEE, 2016|doi =10.1109/TENCON.2016.7848433}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to just cells, extrusion printers may also use hydrogels infused with cells.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

==Impact==
3D bioprinting contributes to significant advances in the medical field of [[tissue engineering]] by allowing for research to be done on innovative materials called [[biomaterials]]. Biomaterials are the materials adapted and used for printing three-dimensional objects. Some of the most notable bioengineered substances are usually stronger than the average bodily materials, including soft tissue and bone. These constituents can act as future substitutes, even improvements, for the original body materials. [[Alginate]], for example, is an anionic polymer with many biomedical implications including feasibility, strong biocompatibility, low toxicity, and stronger structural ability in comparison to some of the body's structural material.&lt;ref name="asme"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.asme.org/engineering-topics/articles/bioengineering/creating-valve-tissue-using-3d-bioprinting |title=Creating Valve Tissue Using 3-D Bioprinting |author =Crawford, M. |work=ASME.org |publisher=American Society of Mechanical Engineers |date=May 2013 |accessdate=17 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Synthetic hydrogels are also commonplace, including PV-based gels. The combination of acid with a UV-initiated PV-based cross-linker has been evaluated by the Wake Forest Institute of Medicine and determined to be a suitable biomaterial.&lt;ref name="MurphyEval12"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Evaluation of hydrogels for bio-printing applications |journal=Journal of Biomedical Materials Research Part A |author1=Murphy, S.V. |author2=Skardal, A. |author3=Atala, A. |volume=101A |issue=1 |pages=272–84 |year=2013 |doi=10.1002/jbm.a.34326 |pmid=22941807}}&lt;/ref&gt; Engineers are also exploring other options such as printing micro-channels that can maximize the diffusion of nutrients and oxygen from neighboring tissues&lt;ref name="cooper" /&gt; In addition, the [[Defense Threat Reduction Agency]] aims to print mini organs such as hearts, livers, and lungs as the potential to test new drugs more accurately and perhaps eliminate the need for testing in animals.&lt;ref name="cooper" /&gt;

==Plot==
The first season follows the Harmon family: Ben ([[Dylan McDermott]]), Vivien ([[Connie Britton]]) and Violet ([[Taissa Farmiga]]), who move from Boston to Los Angeles to start a new life in a Victorian mansion, after Vivien has a [[miscarriage]] and Ben has an affair with Hayden McClaine ([[Kate Mara]]), one of his students. On arrival, they learn from Marcy ([[Christine Estabrook]]), the real estate agent, that the previous owners of their new mansion, a couple named Chad and Patrick ([[Zachary Quinto]] and [[Teddy Sears]]), died in an apparent murder/[[suicide]]. Their neighbor, Constance Langdon, ([[Jessica Lange]]) and her daughter Addie ([[Jamie Brewer]]) become frequent, and mostly unwelcome, guests. Addie seems to have a connection with the house's mysterious past. Larry Harvey ([[Denis O'Hare]]), a former resident of the house who has suffered from terrible burns, also begins inserting himself into the Harmons' lives, giving Ben a cryptic warning about the house. The house also "comes with" Moira O'Hara ([[Frances Conroy]] and [[Alexandra Breckenridge]]), a housekeeper who appears young and seductive to men, but old and matronly to women.

 |ShortSummary    = The Harmon family moves from [[Boston]] to [[Los Angeles]] to recover from mother Vivien's ([[Connie Britton]]) [[miscarriage]] and father Ben's ([[Dylan McDermott]]) infidelity with one of his students. Daughter Violet ([[Taissa Farmiga]]) starts at a new school, only to be terrorized by a group of girls. The family deals with intrusive neighbors Constance ([[Jessica Lange]]) and her daughter, Addie ([[Jamie Brewer]]), who has [[Down syndrome]], along with Larry ([[Denis O'Hare]]), a previous homeowner who set fire to his entire family. Larry's face is severely scarred, likely due to this incident. Ben, a psychiatrist, sees patients out of his home, one of them, a possibly psychotic boy named Tate ([[Evan Peters]]), who becomes friends with Violet. Vivien rehires the house's former housekeeper, an elderly Moira ([[Frances Conroy]]), who appears to Ben as a young, seductive maid ([[Alexandra Breckenridge]]). Ben and Vivien eventually have sex, once after a fight, and later while she thinks he has dressed up in a bondage suit. She later tells Ben she's pregnant.

 |ShortSummary    = The Rubber Man disappears, and Tate appears. He and Violet go on their date to the beach, and Tate tells her high school was terrible for him. Five mangled, bloody teens appear and harass Tate, prompting the couple to leave. Vivien tells Ben that Hayden is in the house. Ben finds her in the basement, but Larry knocks him out with the shovel and ties him up. Nora frees him, urging him to save his child. Hayden appears to Vivien and both are shocked to learn that the other is pregnant with Ben's child. Hayden attacks her, but is stopped by Ben, who is forced to admit that he impregnated Hayden months ''after'' Vivien discovered the affair. The teens find Tate and Violet, but Tate protects Violet by making them chase him. Constance takes Violet to her house, revealing that Addie is dead and Tate is her son. The teens are revealed to be ghosts from various cliques at Westfield High who were killed when Tate committed a school shooting in 1994. The ghosts angrily demand to know why he killed them and that he admit what he did, but Tate cannot remember anything about them. Two of the ghosts, one being a football player and the other a cheerleader, asked why he "targeted jocks" which is probably a reference to the Columbine massacre.  With Halloween night ending, the teens depart. The other ghosts including Moira, Chad, Patrick, and Nora warily return to the house. Ben packs and sadly leaves the house.

 |ShortSummary    = After Violet confirms online that Tate was killed after his massacre at Westfield High (shot by a [[SWAT]] team in the house), Constance introduces her to a [[mediumship|medium]], Billie Dean ([[Sarah Paulson]]) and she and Constance explain that Tate is unaware he is dead. Constance has been sending him to Ben, hoping a breakthrough will help him pass on and they need Violet's help, though Violet is shaken by the revelation. Ben needs to use the house for his therapy sessions to make them money, and Vivien agrees out of necessity. Ben sees a new patient, Derek ([[Eric Stonestreet]]), who is terrified by [[urban legends]], most recently the legend of "Piggy Man", who will slaughter anyone who repeats a specific mantra in the mirror. Ben begins noticing that Vivien has developed an attraction to the security officer. Vivien contacts the ultrasound technician, who fainted during the ultrasound and has since quit her job, claiming she saw that the baby was the [[Antichrist]]. Taking Ben's advice to face his fear, Derek repeats the mantra in his bathroom mirror, but is ironically shot and killed by an armed robber. Violet tries to confront Tate, but is mobbed by the other ghosts. Overwhelmed, she attempts suicide, but Tate saves her. Tate tearfully confesses that he loves her. He plans to leave her alone, but she comforts him.

 |ShortSummary    = Tate is revealed to be the Rubber Man, attempting to provide the distraught Nora with a baby. The outfit is a [[fetish fashion|fetish]] suit Chad bought in hopes of reigniting his and Patrick's failing relationship. Tate donned the suit and killed Patrick and Chad after they decided not to have a baby, hoping that a new family would move in and have a child, which Nora could then have. In the present, Hayden conspires with Nora to drive Vivien insane so that they can have her twins. Vivien and Violet are confronted by the ghostly house intruders from Episode 2; Ben believes that Vivien is mentally unstable because the police found no evidence of the intruders' presence and Violet lied about what she saw. He prohibits Vivien from leaving, believing that she is trying to take Violet and the twins away from him. Vivien steals Marcy's handgun for protection. Hayden convinces Tate, as the Rubber Man, to attack Vivien, revealing that Tate fathered one of Vivien's twins. During the attack, Vivien accidentally shoots Ben, who is convinced that she is a danger to herself and to others. Vivien's reaction to another poltergeist results in the police taking her away. The full scene of Chad and Patrick's murder is shown; it is revealed that after Tate immobilized them, Moira gave Tate the couple's gun, which Tate used to make the scene look like a murder/suicide.

 |ShortSummary    = The events of the famous 1940s [[Black Dahlia]] case are shown. A dentist raped Elizabeth Short while she was under [[anesthesia]], only to find he had administered too much and she had died. The ghost of Charles Montgomery dismembers her corpse. In the present, Elizabeth's ghost appears to Ben, seeking his psychiatric help. Ben receives a call from Vivien's OB/GYN telling him that Vivien's twins have separate fathers – him and someone else. He accuses Vivien of cheating on him. Hayden tells him that she saw Vivien and Luke, the security guard, growing closer. Ben confronts Luke about the possible paternity and learns that Luke is [[Infertility|sterile]]. Constance and Travis get into a domestic dispute; Travis has sex with Hayden in the Harmon house. Hayden kills him, and Larry, who "owes her a favor", takes Travis' body and dumps it out in public in the Black Dahlia tradition. Ben finds the Rubber Man's mask and realizes the possibility that Vivien had been raped. Constance is told by Moira that Tate is the other father. She asks Billie Dean what would happen if a ghost sires a living child. The medium tells her of the Pope's knowledge of such an event as the beginning of the [[Apocalypse]] by the [[Antichrist]].

 |ShortSummary    = It is revealed that Tate caused Larry's scars by setting him on fire on the morning of the school shooting. Constance is told by police of Travis' murder, and her behavior causes them to suspect her as his killer. Ben learns that Violet has not been seen in school in over two weeks and notices a blowfly infestation in the house. Ben calls an exterminator to deal with the infestation, which results in Tate killing the exterminator while he investigates the crawl space beneath the house. Ben and Violet argue about her school attendance which ultimately ends in her reluctant agreement to return on the condition that she changes schools. Ben checks out boarding schools for Violet and, upon hearing this, Tate takes measures to keep her around, ending in showing Violet her own corpse in the house's crawl space. Violet had actually died from her suicide attempt in episode 6, despite Tate's attempts to save her. In an act of [[penance]] for his own crimes, Larry confesses to the murder of Travis after meeting the ghosts of his wife and two daughters for the first time. Ben learns that Tate is the Rubber Man and the other one who got Vivien pregnant.

 |ShortSummary    = Ben goes to pick Vivien up at the sanitarium, intent on taking Violet with him. However Violet, being a ghost, is trapped on the property. He takes Vivien home to pick up Violet as Vivien insists on going to her sister's in Florida. While waiting in the car, Vivien begins to have labor pains. Violet tries to explain to her father that she is dead. Constance brings Vivien into the house and goes to get "help" to assist in the delivery – the ghosts of Dr. Charles Montgomery and the 1968 nurses. As Vivien goes into labor, Chad tells Violet that Tate was the one who sired one of the twins. Vivien has great difficulty giving birth to the babies, losing one to stillbirth while the other causes her to bleed internally. Violet appears to comfort her mother and asks her to "come be with her". Vivien dies and Violet confronts Tate, telling him she loves him but can never forgive him. She screams for him to go away and he does. Vivien appears and comforts her daughter in the afterlife.

 |ShortSummary    = Ben, feeling alone, plans to commit suicide, but the ghosts of Violet and Vivien encourage him to take the living twin and get out of the house. During his attempt, he is killed by Hayden and the home-invader ghosts, hanged from the chandelier; Constance takes the living twin. Moira and other "innocent" ghosts help the Harmon ghosts prevent the deaths of further tenants by scaring away the first family that wants to move in, the Ramoses. Tate, feeling alienated, tries to kill the Ramos son, so Violet won't be alone. She prevents this by distracting Tate. Nora, who wants a child since hers was murdered and turned evil, relinquishes motherhood of the dead Harmon twin to Vivien, who asks Moira to be its godmother. The Harmons and Moira decorate the house for Christmas, while Tate tells Hayden he will wait "forever" for Violet. Three years later, Constance comes home and sees a trail of blood on the floor, leading to the bedroom of the living Harmon twin, now about three years old and looking much like Tate. He has murdered his nanny and is sitting in a rocking chair, smiling up at Constance.

Creators Murphy and Falchuk began working on ''American Horror Story'' before their Fox series ''[[Glee (TV series)|Glee]]'' began production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://insidetv.ew.com/2011/10/05/american-horror-story-ryan-murphy-exclusive/|title='American Horror Story' co-creator Ryan Murphy talks premiere, his favorite scene, and identity of Rubber Man – EXCLUSIVE|last=Stack|first=Tim|website=Entertainment Weekly|date=October 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Murphy wanted to do the opposite of what he had done previously and thus began his work on the series. He stated, "I went from ''Nip/Tuck'' to ''Glee'', so it made sense that I wanted to do something challenging and dark. And I always had loved, as Brad had, the horror genre. So it just was a natural for me." Falchuk was intrigued by the idea of putting a different angle on the horror genre, stating that their main goal in creating the series was to scare viewers. "You want people to be a little bit off balance afterwards," he said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thebacklot.com/ryan-murphy-and-brad-falchuk-talk-american-horror-story-blood-infidelity-and-zachary-quinto/10/2011/|title=Ryan Murphy and Brad Falchuk Talk ''"American Horror Story"'': Blood, Infidelity, and Zachary Quinto|last=Juergens|first=Brian|website=[[AfterEllen.com and TheBacklot.com|The Backlot]]|date=October 3, 2011|accessdate=August 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dark tone of the series is modeled after the ABC soap opera ''[[Dark Shadows]]'', which Murphy's grandmother forced him to watch when he was younger to toughen him up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vulture.com/2011/08/ryan_murphy_talks_american_hor.html|title=Ryan Murphy Talks American Horror Story|last=Adalian|first=Josef|website=Vulture|date=August 6, 2011|accessdate=February 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also cited ''[[Rosemary's Baby (film)|Rosemary's Baby]]'', ''[[Don't Look Now]]'', ''[[The Amityville Horror (film)|The Amityville Horror]]'', and [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s version of ''[[The Shining (film)|The Shining]]'' as influences for the series. 

From the beginning, Murphy and Falchuk planned that each season of the series would tell a different story.&lt;ref name="Mullins"/&gt; After the first-season finale aired, Murphy spoke of his plans to change the cast and location for the second season, while retaining some actors from the first,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/12/22/american-horror-story-will-scare-up-a-new-cast-and-new-haunted-home-for-season-2/|title='American Horror Story' Will Scare Up a New Cast and New Haunted Home for Season 2|last=Itzkoff|first=Dave|website=[[The New York Times]]|date=December 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The people that are coming back will be playing completely different characters, creatures, monsters, etc. [The Harmons'] stories are done."&lt;ref name="Mullins"/&gt;

In February 2011, FX officially announced that it had ordered a pilot for a possible series from Ryan Murphy and Brad Falchuk, with both Murphy and Falchuk writing and Murphy directing. [[Dante Di Loreto]] was announced as executive producer. Production on the series began in April 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hitfix.com/articles/fx-orders-american-horror-story-from-glee-pair/|title=FX orders 'American Horror Story' from 'Glee' pair|last=Fienberg|first=Daniel|website=Entertainment Weekly|date=February 17, 2011|accessdate=February 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2011, FX officially announced the project had been given a series order consisting of 13 episodes.&lt;ref name="seriespickedup"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thefutoncritic.com/news/2011/07/18/fx-orders-american-horror-story-to-series-702212/20110718fx01/|title=FX Orders "American Horror Story" to Series|website=The Futon Critic|date=July 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2011, it was announced that [[Tim Minear]], [[Jennifer Salt]], [[James Wong (producer)|James Wong]] and Jessica Sharzer had joined the series as writers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/american-horror-story-adds-tim-218735|title='American Horror Story' Adds Tim Minear, 3 More Writers (Exclusive)|last=Goldberg|first=Lesley|website=The Hollywood Reporter|date=August 3, 2011|accessdate=August 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Future season===
On October 30, 2016, Murphy announced that a future crossover season of the series would continue the ''Murder House'' and ''Coven'' stories, merging their characters and themes. He did not state which season it would be, but that he had already reached out to actors from both seasons to reprise their respective roles.&lt;ref name="NewMurder"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2016/10/30/ahs-murder-house-coven-crossover-season|title=AHS: Ryan Murphy announces Murder House and Coven crossover season|last=Snetiker|first=Marc|website=Entertainment Weekly|date=October 30, 2016|accessdate=October 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Murphy later confirmed one of the ''Murder House'' characters will be moved in the season finale of ''Coven''. However, on January 5, 2018, it was initially announced that the crossover season will be taking place in the ninth season, but on June 14, 2018, the crossover was moved from Season 9 to the eighth season, ''[[American Horror Story: Apocalypse|Apocalypse]]'' instead.

===Casting===
Casting announcements began in March 2011, with [[Connie Britton]] first to be cast, portraying female lead Vivien Harmon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://insidetv.ew.com/2011/03/18/connie-britton-ryan-murphy-american-horror-stor/|title='Friday Night Lights' star Connie Britton cast in Ryan Murphy's 'American Horror Story' pilot|last=Stransky|first=Tanner|website=Entertainment Weekly|date=March 18, 2011|accessdate=March 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Britton stated that she took a risk in taking the role of Vivien. When Murphy presented the role to her, he said, "This is something we've never seen you do before. It will be turning what you've just been doing on its ear." She was intrigued by what he had presented her and ultimately decided to take the part.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/health/story/health/story/2011-12-06/What-you-dont-know-about-TVs-Connie-Britton/51653380/1|title=What you don't know about TV's Connie Britton|last=Carter|first=Gayle Jo|website=USA Today|date=December 6, 2011|accessdate=February 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', series co-creator [[Ryan Murphy (writer)|Ryan Murphy]] stated that he had told Connie Britton, early on, that her character Vivien would die in the first season. "We've really had the whole season mapped out from the beginning," he said. "In the meetings with the core actors, the three leads being Connie, Dylan [McDermott] and Jessica [Lange], as we tried to snare them we were able to say this is where you start, this is the middle, and this is where you end up. So, yes, I was able to tell Connie really the whole run of the series."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://insidetv.ew.com/2011/12/15/american-horror-story-ryan-murphy-vivien-birth/|title='American Horror Story': Ryan Murphy warns finale's brutal labor scene is 'the most shocking scene we've ever done' – EXCLUSIVE|website=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|last=Stack|first=Tim|date=December 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Denis O'Hare]] joined the cast in late March 2011 as Larry Harvey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2011/03/denis-ohare-joins-ryan-murphys-fx-pilot-american-horror-story/|title=Denis O'Hare Joins Ryan Murphy's FX Pilot 'American Horror Story'|last=Andreeva|first=Nellie|website=Deadline Hollywood|date=March 30, 2011|accessdate=March 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jessica Lange]] joined the cast in April 2011 as Constance, marking her first regular role on television.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2011/04/jessica-lange-to-star-in-ryan-murphybrad-falchuks-fx-pilot-american-horror-story/|title=Jessica Lange To Star In Ryan Murphy/Brad Falchuk's FX Pilot 'American Horror Story'|last=Andreeva|first=Nellie|website=Deadline Hollywood|date=April 13, 2011|accessdate=April 13, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511115208/http://www.deadline.com/2011/04/jessica-lange-to-star-in-ryan-murphybrad-falchuks-fx-pilot-american-horror-story/|archivedate=May 11, 2011|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lange was attracted to the role because it didn't require a 22-episode commitment like a series on a broadcast network. "That was huge for me!" she said. "I wasn't about to commit to, you know, six months. It was cable, rather than network... I've been offered network [shows] before, and determined not to do it, just because I can't make that kind of time commitment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thebacklot.com/jessica-lange-talks-ryan-murphys-american-horror-story/10/2011/|title=Jessica Lange Talks Ryan Murphy's "American Horror Story"|last=Eggertsen|first=Chris|website=TheBacklot.com|date=October 10, 2011|accessdate=February 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dylan McDermott]] was cast as the lead Ben Harmon in late April 2011. His character was initially described as "a handsome and masculine but sensitive therapist who loves his family but has hurt his wife."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2011/04/dylan-mcdermott-to-star-in-ryan-murphys-fx-pilot-american-horror-story/|title=Dylan McDermott To Star In Ryan Murphy's FX Pilot 'American Horror Story'|last=Andreeva|first=Nellie|website=Deadline Hollywood|date=April 29, 2011|accessdate=April 29, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110508144336/http://www.deadline.com//2011//04//dylan-mcdermott-to-star-in-ryan-murphys-fx-pilot-american-horror-story//|archivedate=May 8, 2011&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; McDermott stated that he wanted to do the role to break away from his previous role as Bobby Donnell in the ABC series ''[[The Practice]]''. "This was exactly why I wanted to do this show – to change it up and do a different kind of character. People think of me as the guy from ''The Practice''... I wanted to turn that [notion] on its head and hopefully I'm doing that [with this show]", he said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2011/10/05/dylan-mcdermott-ryan-murphy-talk-horror-self-gratification/|title=Dylan McDermott, Ryan Murphy Talk 'American Horror Story'|last=Michals|first=Susan|website=The Wall Street Journal|date=October 5, 2011|accessdate=December 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2011, [[Taissa Farmiga]] and [[Evan Peters]] were the last lead actors to be cast, portraying Violet Harmon and Tate Langdon, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2011/05/american-horror-story-casts-young-leads/|title='American Horror Story' Casts Young Leads|last=Andreeva|first=Nellie|website=Deadline Hollywood|date=May 5, 2011|accessdate=May 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Farmiga said that she loved Violet "immediately" and that "she had spunk to her, she had attitude."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/News/American-Horror-Story-Taissa-Farmiga-Interview-Spoilers-1040595.aspx|title=American Horror Story's Taissa Farmiga Dishes on Violet's Fate and What's Coming Up Next|last=Martin|first=Denise|website=TV Guide|date=December 8, 2011|accessdate=December 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Murphy has described Tate as the "true monster" of the series, adding, "To Evan's great credit and the credit of the writers, I think Evan's done an amazingly difficult job making a monster sympathetic."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://insidetv.ew.com/2011/11/30/american-horror-story-ryan-murphy-spooky-little-girl/|title='American Horror Story': Ryan Murphy talks the Black Dahlia and whether Violet is alive... or dead – EXCLUSIVE|last=Stack|first=Tim|website=Entertainment Weekly|date=November 30, 2011|accessdate=November 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Filming===
[[File:1120 Winchester Place Los Angeles CA.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Murphy was looking for a house that could be appropriately creepy but also attractive.&lt;ref name="keeps"/&gt;]]
The [[Pilot (American Horror Story)|pilot episode]] was shot on location in a house in [[Country Club Park, Los Angeles]], California, which serves as the [[haunted house]] and crime scene in the series. Designed and built in 1902 by [[Alfred Rosenheim]], the president of the [[American Institute of Architects]]' Los Angeles chapter, the [[Tudor Revival architecture|Tudor]] or [[Collegiate Gothic in North America|Collegiate Gothic]]-style single family home was previously used as a convent.&lt;ref name="keeps"&gt;{{cite web|first=David A.|last=Keeps|date=October 31, 2011|title=Set Pieces: The haunted house of 'American Horror Story'|website=[[Los Angeles Times]]|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/home_blog/2011/10/american-horror-story-house.html|accessdate=November 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Adrian Glick|last=Kudler|date=October 4, 2011|title=''American Horror Story'' Gave Alfred Rosenheim House in Country Club Park an Early Halloween Costume|website=Curbed.com|url=http://la.curbed.com/archives/2011/10/american_horror_story_gave_country_club_park_rosenheim_house_early_halloween_costume.php|accessdate=October 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; An adjoining [[chapel]] was removed from exterior shots using [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Kristin|last=Dos Santos|authorlink=Kristin Dos Santos|date=January 27, 2012|title=The American Horror Story House Is on the Market for How Much?

Due to a "very aggressive" production schedule and the series' pilot shoot having to wait for co-creators Ryan Murphy and Brad Falchuk's other show, ''[[Glee (TV series)|Glee]]'', to wrap its second season production, it was announced that the show's first-season finale, the thirteenth episode, would be thirty minutes shorter than planned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Andreeva|first=Nellie|date=November 18, 2011|url=http://deadline.com/2011/11/american-horror-story-two-hour-finale-will-be-trimmed-to-90-minutes/|title='American Horror Story' Two-Hour Finale Will Be Trimmed To 90 Minutes|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|accessdate=November 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, the thirteenth episode was dropped and they made the twelfth episode 10 minutes longer (52 minutes). The finale aired on December 21, 2011.

The opening title sequence was created by [[Kyle Cooper]] and his company [[Prologue (creative agency)|Prologue]]. He also created the title sequence for the [[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]] series ''[[The Walking Dead (TV series)|The Walking Dead]]'' and the 1995 film ''[[Seven (1995 film)|Se7en]]''.

The '''American Tap Dance Foundation''' is a nonprofit organization whose primary goal is the presentation and teaching of [[tap dance]]. Its original stated purpose was to provide an "international home for tap dance, perpetuate tap as a contemporary art form, preserve it through performance and an archival library, provide educational programming, and establish a formal school for tap dance."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archives.nypl.org/dan/18487|title=New York Public Library Archives &amp; Manuscripts.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Originally called the '''American Tap Dance Orchestra''' ('''ATDO'''), the American Tap Dance Foundation was founded in 1986 by tap dancers [[Brenda Bufalino]], [[Tony Waag]], and [[Honi Coles|Charles "Honi" Coles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nyc-arts.org/organizations/2086/american-tap-dance-foundation|title=NYC-Arts: The Complete Guide.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bufalino began working with Coles in 1973 when Bufalino produced the documentary, "Great Feats of Feet: Portraits Of the Jazz Tap Dancer" featuring Coles and ''The Copasetics''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/06/22/brenda-bufalino-tap-dancing_n_1619210.html|title= Brenda Bufalino On The Future Of Tap Dancing, HuffPost|date=June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ATDO's first major engagement was on July 4, 1986, at the [[Statue of Liberty]] Festival in [[Battery Park]] in lower New York City.{{sfn|Valis Hill 2010|p=264}}  For the next 15 years, American Tap Dance Orchestra toured the U.S. and Europe. In 1989, ATDO appeared on PBS "[[Great Performances]] Tap Dance In America with [[Gregory Hines]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://search.alexanderstreet.com/preview/work/394526|title=Someone Stole the Baby: a documentary on Brenda Bufalino and the American Tap Dance Orchestra|date=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mastersofamericantapdance.com/profiles/brenda_bufalino.html|title=Masters of American Tap Dance}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Woodpeckers Tap Dance Center (1989-1995)===
On November 10, 1989, the ATDO opened Woodpeckers Tap Dance Center at 170 Mercer Street, near [[Houston Street]] in New York City. {{sfn|Valis Hill 2010|p=297}} Mr. Coles served as Woodpeckers's chairman; Gregory Hines (who claimed that Woodpeckers was "the world's only tap-only center and had "the finest tap floor I've been on") was a member of the board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/13/nyregion/neighborhood-report-soho-the-sounds-of-silence-at-tap-center.html|title=Neighborhood Report: SOHO; The Sounds Of Silence At Tap Center, The New York Times|date=November 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; Woodpeckers began creating, producing, and presenting various educational programs for adults and children. It also initiated an annual winter tap intensive with master classes, courses and workshops taught by leading International artists and master tap dancers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.mastersofamericantapdance.com/profiles/tony_waag.html|title=Masters of American Tap Dance}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A review in The New York Times in 1990 said, "The rough-hewn little theater has the air of both a place where hard and serious work is done and a cozy family living room." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/12/03/arts/review-dance-the-patter-and-patterns-of-wittily-tapping-feet.html|title=The Patter and Patterns Of Wittily Tapping Feet, The News York Times|date=December 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Center closed in 1995 due to limited funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dancespirit.com/uncategorized/American_Tap_Dance_Foundation_Has_a_New_Home/|title=American Tap Dance Foundation Has a New Home, Dance Spirit|date=January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1996 through 2010===

====The Intervening Years====
ATDO continued to perform and offer classes and workshops, renting classroom and rehearsal studios at various NYC locations &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.dancespirit.com/uncategorized/American_Tap_Dance_Foundation_Has_a_New_Home/|title=Dance Spirit|date=January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and presenting new and classic works around the country and the world. Venues included Lincoln Center's [[Walter Reade Theater]], the [[Sammy Davis Jr.|Sammy Davis Jr. Festival Plaza]] in L.A., and [[Gus Giordano]]'s Jazz Dance Congress 96, (Washington, D.C.'s [[Kennedy Center]]) as well as on live television in Rome, Italy, at the [[Stadttheater Furth]] Germany, and at the Rio de Janeiro Tap Festival, Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.atdf.org/history96-05.html|title=ATDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====A New Name and Focus====
Towards the end of 2001, ATDO was renamed the American Tap Dance Foundation (ATDF). The reasons were twofold: first, the new name allowed for a broader focus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/06/22/brenda-bufalino-tap-dancing_n_1619210.html|title= Brenda Bufalino On The Future Of Tap Dancing|date=June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The change reflected a new generation of tap dancers and a renewed focus on establishing the first-ever Center for Tap – an international home for dancers, based in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.nyc-arts.org/organizations/2086/american-tap-dance-foundation|title=NYC-Arts}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bufalino stayed on as an artistic mentor and [[Tony Waag]] became the Artistic/Executive Director.

The new name also reflected the fact that an organized ensemble no longer existed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atdf.org/Press%20Articles/Dancer6pg.01May09.pdf|title=Tapping Tony, by Wendy Garafoli, Dance Magazine|date=April–May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009 the Foundation was awarded an American Masterpiece Grant from the National Endowment for the Arts to reconstruct two ATDO pieces, "Buff Loves Basie Blues," and "Haitian Fight Song,".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.tapdance.org/content/cnadm%E2%80%99s-2011-lifetime-artistic-achievement-awards|title= International Tap Association|date=April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both have been subsequently performed by ATDF at various venues around the country including [[Symphony Space]] and the [[Joyce Theater]] in New York City.

===A New Home (2010 to the Present)===
On January 4, 2010, the ATDF relocated to a 3,000 square foot space in [[Greenwich Village]] that includes two large dance studios as well as office space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.dancespirit.com/uncategorized/American_Tap_Dance_Foundation_Has_a_New_Home/|title=Dance Spirit|date=January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.backstage.com/advice-for-actors/dancers/take-it-on-home/|title=Backstage|date=February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==

The ATDF presents a variety of year-round educational programs, performances, festivals, classes, and public city-wide events.

===Rhythm in Motion===
''Rhythm in Motion'', is an annual showcase for tap choreographers to showcase their work. The showcase includes works by emerging and established tappers and aims to highlight the "rich diversity of contemporary tap dance."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.dance-enthusiast.com/features/view/Rhythm-Motion-Tap-Festival|title=Dance Enthusiast|date=April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, RIM featured new choreography by [[MacArthur Fellow]], [[Michelle Dorrance]], Brenda Bufalino, [[Derick K. Grant]], [[Chloe Arnold]], and others over a five-day, six-performance program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.macfound.org/fellows/935/|title=MacArthur Foundation, Meet the Class of 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dance-enthusiast.com/dance-listings/events/date-2015-04-15/view/AMERICAN-TAP-DANCE-FOUNDATIONS-RHYTHM-IN-MOTION-RETURNS-TO-14Y-2015-04-22_26|title=American Tap Dance Foundation's "Rhythm in Motion" returns to 14Y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tap City===

The ATDF organizes "Tap City", which has been called, "The preeminent annual tap dance festival of the world.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.broadwayworld.com/article/American-Tap-Dance-Foundation-Presents-TAP-CITY-Festival-Throughout-July-20120703|title=American Tap Dance Foundation Presents TAP CITY Festival Throughout July, Broadwayworld.com|date=July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This annual week-long international event features classes, panels, screenings, and performances. Highlights include awards ceremonies, concert performances, and ''Tap it Out'', a free, public, outdoor event performed in Times Square by a chorus of 300 people "in a pre-choreographed orchestral collage of ''a cappella'' unison rhythms, contrapuntal sequences, individual riffs, movements and grooves." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dance-enthusiast.com/dance-listings/events/view/TAP-CITY-hits-NYC-2013-06-24-150000|title=Dance Enthusiast|date=June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other===

'''Architectural design values''' make up an important part of what influences [[architect]]s and [[designer]]s when they make their design decisions. However, architects and designers are not always influenced by the same values and intentions. Value and intentions differ between different [[Architectural style|architectural movements]]. It also differs between different [[List of international architecture schools|schools of architecture]] and schools of design as well as among individual [[List of architects|architects]] and [[List of industrial designers|designers]].&lt;ref&gt;Holm, Ivar (2006). ''Ideas and Beliefs in Architecture and Industrial design: How attitudes, orientations, and underlying assumptions shape the built environment''. Oslo School of Architecture and Design. {{ISBN|82-547-0174-1}}.{{cite web|url=http://www.aho.no/Global/Dokumenter/Forskning/Avhandlinger/Holm_Ideas_and_Beliefs.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-05-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724174839/http://www.aho.no/Global/Dokumenter/Forskning/Avhandlinger/Holm_Ideas_and_Beliefs.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The differences in values and intentions are directly linked to the [[Timeline of architecture|pluralism in design]] outcomes that exist within architecture and design. It is also a big contributing factor as to how an architect or designer operates in his/her relation to clients.

Different design values tend to have a considerable history and can be found in numerous design movements. The influence that each design value has had on design movements and individual designers has varied throughout history.

==Aesthetic design values==
The expansion of architectural and industrial design ideas and vocabularies which took place during the last century has created a diverse [[Aesthetics|aesthetic]] reality within these two domains. This pluralistic and diverse aesthetic reality has typically been created within different architectural and industrial design movements such as: [[Modernism]], [[Postmodernism]], [[Deconstructivism]], [[Post-structuralism]], [[Neoclassicism]], New Expressionism, Supermodernism etc.&lt;ref&gt;KRIEGER, P. (2004) Contextualism. IN SENNOTT, R. S. (Ed.) Encyclopedia of 20th-century architecture. New York, Fitzroy Dearborn.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;STEER, L. M. (2004) Supermodernism. IN SENNOTT, R. S. (Ed.) Encyclopedia of 20th-century architecture. New York, Fitzroy Dearborn.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FLORES"&gt;FLORES, C. A. H. (2004) Symbolism. IN SENNOTT, R. S. (Ed.) Encyclopedia of 20th-century architecture. New York, Fitzroy Dearborn.&lt;/ref&gt; All of these aesthetic realities represent a number of divergent aesthetic values, in addition to differences in general values and theories found within these movements.&lt;ref name="FLORES" /&gt; Some of the stylistic distinctions found in these diverse aesthetic realities reflects profound differences in design values and thinking,&lt;ref name="FLORES" /&gt; but this is not the case for all stylistic distinctions, as some stylistic distinctions builds on similar thinking and values.

These aesthetic values and their diverse aesthetic expressions are to some degree a reflection of the development that has taken place in the art community. In addition, more general changes have taken place in Western societies, due to technological development, new economic realities, political changes etc. However, these diverse aesthetic expressions are also a reflection of individual architects and industrial designers’ personal expression, based on designers’ tendency to experiment with form, materials, and ornament to create new aesthetic styles and aesthetic vocabulary. Changes in aesthetic styles and expressions have been, and still are, both synchronic and diachronic, as different aesthetic styles are produced and promoted simultaneously.&lt;ref name="FLORES" /&gt;

A number of values which cannot be classified as aesthetic design values have influenced the development of the aesthetic reality, as well as contributed to the pluralistic aesthetic reality which characterises contemporary architecture and industrial design.

Aesthetic Design Values, contains seven values.

===Artistic aspects and self-expression===
It is characterised by a belief that individual self-expression—or one’s inner spiritual self and creative imagination, inner resources and intuition—should be utilised and/or be the base used when designing.&lt;ref name="Gelernter"&gt;Gelernter, M. (1995). Sources of architectural form: a critical history of Western design theory. Manchester, Manchester University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; These sentiments are closely linked to a number of artistic values found in movements like [[Expressionism]] and the [[Avant-garde]] art.&lt;ref&gt;Fedders, K. (2004). Archigram. Encyclopedia of 20th-century architecture. R. S. Sennott. New York, Fitzroy Dearborn. 1: 57 - 58.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Heynen, H. (2004). Avant-garde. Encyclopedia of 20th-century architecture. R. S. Sennott. New York, Fitzroy Dearborn. 1: 97 - 99.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, this design value is closely related to abstract forms and expression, personal creative liberty, elitism and being ahead of the rest of society.

===The spirit of the time design value===
This design value is based on the conception that every age has a certain spirit or set of shared attitudes that should be utilised when designing. The [[Zeitgeist|Spirit of the Times]] denotes the intellectual and cultural climate of a particular era,&lt;ref&gt;Hume, D. (1965). Of the standard of taste: and other essays. Indianapolis, The Bobbs-Merrill Company.&lt;/ref&gt; which can be linked to an experience of a certain worldview, sense of taste, [[collective consciousness]] and unconsciousness.&lt;ref name="Gelernter" /&gt; Thus “form expression” which can be found, to some  extent in the “air” of a given time and each generation, should generate an aesthetic style that expresses the uniqueness related to that time.&lt;ref name="BROLIN"&gt;Brolin, B. C. (2000). Architectural ornament: banishment and return. New York, Norton.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The structural, functional and material honesty design value===
Structural Honesty is linked to the notion that a structure shall display its “true” purpose and not be decorative etc.&lt;ref name="BROLIN" /&gt; Functional honesty is linked to the idea that a building or product form shall be shaped on the basis of its intended function, often known as “[[form follows function]]”. Material honesty implies that materials should be used and selected on the bases of their properties,&lt;ref&gt;KAUFMANN, E. (1955) Architecture in the age of reason; baroque and postbaroque in england, italy, and france, Cambridge, Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and that the characteristics of a material should influence the form it is used for.&lt;ref&gt;NESBITT, K. (1996) Theorizing a new agenda for architecture: an anthology of architectural theory 1965-1995, New York, Princeton Architectural Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, a material must not be used as a substitute for another material as this subverts the materials “true” properties and it is “cheating” the spectator.&lt;ref&gt;WHITELEY, N. (1993) Design for society, London, Reaktion Books.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The simplicity and minimalism design value===
This design value is based on the idea that [[Minimalism|simple forms]], i.e. aesthetics without considerable ornaments, simple geometry, smooth surfaces etc., represents forms which are both truer to “real” art and represents “folk” wisdom.&lt;ref&gt;TOY, M. (1999) EDITORIAL. IN TOY, M. (Ed.) Aspects of minimal architecture II. London, Academy Editions.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;RUBY, I. &amp; RUBY, A. (2003) Essential, Meta-, Trans-. The Chimeras of Minimalist Architecture. IN RUBY, I. (Ed.) Minimal architecture. Munich, Prestel.&lt;/ref&gt; This design value implies that the more cultivated a person becomes, the more decoration disappears. In addition, it is linked to the notion that simple forms will free people from the everyday clutter, thus contribute to tranquillity and restfulness.&lt;ref&gt;SILVESTRIN, C. (1999) Royal Academy and AD International Forum, Something or Nothing: Minimalism in Art and Architecture 8. IN TOY, M. (Ed.) Aspects of minimal architecture II. London, Academy Editions.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nature and organic design value===
This design value is based on the idea that [[Natural building|nature]] (i.e. all sorts of living organisms, numerical laws etc.) can provide inspiration, functional clues and aesthetic forms that architects and industrial designers should use as a basis for designs.&lt;ref&gt;ALDERSEY-WILLIAMS, H. (2003) Zoomorphic : new animal architecture, London, Laurence King Publ.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pearson"&gt;PEARSON, D. (2001) New organic architecture: the breaking wave, Berkeley, University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Designs based on this value tend to be characterized by free-flowing curves, asymmetrical lines and expressive forms. This design value can be summed up in “form follows flow” or “of the hill” as opposed to “on the hill”.&lt;ref name="Pearson" /&gt;

===The classic, traditional and vernacular aesthetics design value===
This value is based on a belief that a building and product should be designed from timeless principles that transcend particular designers, cultures and climates.&lt;ref name="Gelernter" /&gt; Implicit in this design value is the notion that if these forms are used, the public will appreciate a structure’s timeless beauty and understand immediately how to use a given building or product.&lt;ref name="BEATLEY, T. 2004"&gt;BEATLEY, T. &amp; WHEELER, S. M. (2004) The sustainable urban development reader, London, Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; This design value is also linked to [[Vernacular architecture|regional differences]] i.e. varying climate etc. and folklore cultures, which creates distinctive aesthetical expressions.&lt;ref name="GELERNTER, M. &amp; DUBRUCQ"&gt;GELERNTER, M. &amp; DUBRUCQ, V. (2004) Regionalism. IN SENNOTT, R. S. (Ed.) Encyclopedia of 20th-century architecture. New York, Fitzroy Dearborn.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The regionalism design value===
This design value is based on the belief that building—and to some degree products—should be designed in accordance with the particular characteristics of a specific place.&lt;ref name="GELERNTER, M. &amp; DUBRUCQ" /&gt; In addition, it is linked to the aim of achieving visual harmony between a building and its surroundings, as well as achieving continuity in a given area.&lt;ref&gt;ABEL, C. (1997) Architecture and identity: towards a global eco-culture, Oxford, Architectural Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, it strives to create a connection between past and present forms of building. Finally, this value is also often related to preserving and creating regional and national identity.&lt;ref&gt;LEFAIVRE, L. &amp; TZONIS, A. (2003) Critical regionalism: architecture and identity in a globalized world, Munich, Prestel.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social design values==
Many architects and industrial designers have a strong motivation to serve the public good and the needs of the user population.&lt;ref&gt;SYMES, M., ELEY, J. &amp; SEIDEL, A. D. (1995) Architects and their practices: a changing profession, Oxford, Butterworth Architecture.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, social awareness and social values within architecture and design reflect, to some degree, the emphasis these values are given in society at large.

It should be noted that social values can have an aesthetical impact, but these aspects will not be explored as the main aesthetical impact found in design has been covered in the previous sections. [[Social design]] values are at times in conflict with other design values. This type of conflict can manifest itself between different design movements, but it can also be the cause of conflicts within a given design movement. It can be argued that conflicts between social values and other design values often represent the continuing debate between Rationalism and Romanticism commonly found within architecture and industrial design.&lt;ref&gt;JOHNSON, D. L. (2004) Rationalism. IN SENNOTT, R. S. (Ed.) Encyclopedia of 20th-century architecture. New York, Fitzroy Dearborn.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Social Design Values category consisting of four design values.

===The social change design value===
This design value can be described as a commitment to change society for the better through architecture and industrial design.&lt;ref&gt;ZIPF, C. W. (2004) Arts and crafts movement. IN SENNOTT, R. S. (Ed.) Encyclopedia of 20th-century architecture. New York, Fitzroy Dearborn.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;HUGHES, R. (1991) The shock of the new art and the century of change, London, Thames and Hudson.&lt;/ref&gt; This design value is closely connected and associated with political movements and subsequent building programs.&lt;ref&gt;HATCH, C. R. (1984) The scope of social architecture, New York, Van Nostrand Reinhold.&lt;/ref&gt; Architects and industrial designers that are committed to the design value of social change often see their work as a tool for transforming the built environment and those who live in it.&lt;ref name="SANOFF"&gt;SANOFF, H. (2000) Community participation methods in design and planning, New York, Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The consultation and participation design value===
This design value is based on a belief that it is beneficial to involve [[Participatory design|stakeholders in the design process]].&lt;ref name="SANOFF" /&gt; This value is connected to a belief that user involvement leads to:
#Meeting social needs and an effective use of resources.&lt;ref name="SANOFF" /&gt;
#Influencing in the design process as well as awareness of the consequences etc.&lt;ref name="SANOFF" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;PREISER, W. F. E., WHITE, E. T. &amp; RABINOWITZ, H. Z. (1988) Post-occupancy evaluation, New York, Van Nostrand Reinhold.&lt;/ref&gt;
#Providing relevant and up-to-date information for designers.&lt;ref name="SANOFF" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;ZIMRING, C. M. &amp; REIZENSTEIN, J. E. (1981) A Primer on [[post occupancy evaluation]]: uses and techniques of an increasingly valued tool. Architecture (AIA Journal), 70, 52 - 54.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The crime prevention design value===
This design value is based on the belief that the built environment can be manipulated to reduce crime levels,&lt;ref&gt;PRESS, M., COOPER, R. &amp; EROL, R. (2001) Design as a tool for social policy: the case of 'design against crime'. The Fourth European Academy of Design Conference. Aveiro Portugal.&lt;/ref&gt; which is attempted accomplished through three main strategies that are: 
#Defensible space.&lt;ref&gt;NEWMAN, O. (1972) Defensible space: crime prevention through urban design, New York, Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="COLQUHOUN"&gt;COLQUHOUN, I. (2004) Design out crime: creating safe and sustainable communities, Amsterdam, Elsevier.&lt;/ref&gt;
#Crime prevention through environmental design.&lt;ref name="COLQUHOUN" /&gt;
#Situational crime prevention.&lt;ref name="COLQUHOUN" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;WEKERLE, G. R. &amp; WHITZMAN, C. (1995) Safe cities: guidelines for planning, design, and management, New York ; London, Van Nostrand Reinhold.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The 'Third world' design value===
This is based on an eagerness to help developing countries [[Architecture for Humanity|through architecture]] and design (i.e. a response to the needs of the poor and destitute within the [[Third World]]).&lt;ref&gt;SERAGELDIN, I. (1997) The architecture of empowerment a survey. IN SERAGELDIN, I. (Ed.) The Architecture of empowerment : people, shelter and livable cities. London, Academy Editions.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;STRASSMANN, P. W. (1998) Third world housing. IN VAN VLIET, W. (Ed.) The Encyclopedia of housing. Thousand Oaks, Calif, Sage Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; This design value implies that social and economic circumstances found in the Third World necessitate the development of special solutions, which are distinct from what the same architects and industrial designers would recommend for the developed world.&lt;ref&gt;YUNUS, M. (1997) Foreword. IN SERAGELDIN, I. (Ed.) The Architecture of empowerment : people, shelter and livable cities. London, Academy Editions.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;ÖZKAN, S. (1997) Architecture to change the world? IN SERAGELDIN, I. (Ed.) The Architecture of empowerment : people, shelter and livable cities. London, Academy Editions.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Environmental design values==
The 20th century has been marked by the re-emergence of environmental values within Western societies.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} Concern for the environment is not new and can be found to a varying degree throughout history, and it is rooted in a number of perspectives including the aim of managing the ecosystems for sustained resource yields (sustainable development), and the idea that everything in nature has an intrinsic value (nature protection and preservation). Generally behind these types of thinking are the concepts of stewardship and that the present generation owes duties to generations not yet born.&lt;ref name="BEATLEY, T. 2004" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;THOMPSON, I. H. (2000) Aesthetic, social and ecological values in landscape architecture: a discourse analysis. Ethics, place and environment, 3, 269-287.&lt;/ref&gt;

Environmental problems and challenges found in the 19th and 20th centuries led to a development where environmental values became important in some sections of Western societies. It is therefore not surprising{{According to whom|date=March 2012}} that these values can also be found among individual architects and industrial designers. The focus on [[environmental design]] has been marked with the rediscovery and further development of many “ancient” skills and techniques.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} In addition, new technology that approaches environmental concerns is also an important characteristic of the environmental approach found among architects and industrial designers. These rather different approaches to environmental building and product technology can be illustrated with the development of environmental [[high-tech architecture]], and the more “traditional” environmental movement within is ecological based architecture.&lt;ref name="CUFF, D"&gt;CUFF, D. (2000) Epilogue. IN KOSTOF, S. (Ed.) ''The Architect : chapters in the history of the profession''. Berkeley, Calif., University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Environmental technology, along with new environmental values, have affected development in cities across the world. Many cities have started to formulate and introduce "eco-regulations concerning renewable resources, energy consumption, sick buildings, smart buildings, recycled materials, and sustainability".&lt;ref name="CUFF, D" /&gt; This may not be surprising, as about 50% of all energy consumption in Europe and 60% in the US is building-related.&lt;ref name="CUFF, D" /&gt; However, environmental concerns are not restricted to energy consumption; environmental concerns take on a number of perspectives generally, which are reflected in the focus found among architects and industrial designers.

The environmental design values category consists of three design values.

===Green and sustainability===
This value is based on a belief that a [[Sustainable design|sustainable]] and/or environmentally friendly building approach is beneficial to users, society and future generations.&lt;ref&gt;MCDONALD, M. K. (2004) Sustainability and sustainable architecture. IN SENNOTT, R. S. (Ed.) ''Encyclopedia of 20th-century architecture''. New York, Fitzroy Dearborn.&lt;/ref&gt; Key concepts within this design value are: energy conservation, resource management, recycling, cradle-to-cradle, toxic free materials etc.&lt;ref name="BEATLEY, T. 2004" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;MOSTAEDI, A. (2002) Sustainable architecture: low tech houses, Barcelona, Carles Broto i Comerma.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;MOSTAEDI, A. (2003) Sustainable architecture: high tech housing, Barcelona, Carles Broto i Comerma.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;WINES, J. &amp; JODIDIO, P. (2000) Green architecture, Köln, Taschen.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Re-use and modification===
This is based on a belief that existing buildings, and to some degree products, can be continuously used through updates.&lt;ref&gt;KALNER, S. (2004) Adaptwe re-use. IN SENNOTT, R. S. (Ed.) Encyclopedia of 20th-century architecture. New York, Fitzroy Dearborn.&lt;/ref&gt; Within this value there are two separate schools of thought with regards to aesthetics: one camp focuses on new elements that are sublimated to an overall aesthetic, and the other advocates for aesthetical contrast, dichotomy and even dissonance between the old and the new.&lt;ref name="POWELL, K. 1999"&gt;POWELL, K. (1999) Architecture reborn: the conversion and reconstruction of old buildings, London, Laurence King.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health===
This design value is based on the belief that the built environment can contribute to ensuring a [[Sick building syndrome|healthy living environment]].&lt;ref name="FRANK"&gt;FRANK, L. D., ENGELKE, P. O. &amp; SCHMID, T. L.

==Traditional design values==
Within both architecture and industrial design there is a long tradition of being both inspired by and re-use design elements of existing buildings and products. This is the case even if many architects and industrial designers argue that they are primarily using their creativity to create new and novel design solutions. Some architects and industrial designers have openly led themselves be inspired by existing building and products traditions, and have even used this inspiration as the main base for their designs solutions.

This design tradition has a considerable history, which can be indicated in many of the labels associated with this tradition; this includes labels such as [[Classicism]], Vernacular, Restoration and Preservation etc. In addition, as indicated in the previous section “Classic, Traditional and Vernacular aesthetics”, an important element of this tradition is to re-use and be inspired by already existing aesthetical elements and styles. However, the traditional approach also implies other aspects such as functional aspects, preserving existing building traditions as well as individual buildings and products.

The Traditional Design Values category, consisting of three distinct values.

===The tradition based design value===
This relies on a belief that traditional “designs” are the preferred typology and template for buildings and products, because they “create” timeless and “functional” designs.&lt;ref&gt;AMUNDSON, J. A. &amp; MILLER, C. C. (2004) Classicism. IN SENNOTT, R. S. (Ed.) Encyclopedia of 20th-century architecture. New York, Fitzroy Dearborn.&lt;/ref&gt; Within this design value there are three main strategies:
#Critical traditionalist/regionalist i.e. interpreting the traditional typologies and templates and applying them in an abstracted modern vocabulary.&lt;ref name="TILMAN"&gt;TILMAN, J. T. (2004) Historicism. IN SENNOTT, R. S. (Ed.) Encyclopedia of 20th-century architecture. New York, Fitzroy Dearborn.&lt;/ref&gt;
#Revivalists i.e. adhering to the most literal traditional form.&lt;ref name="TILMAN" /&gt;
#Contextualists who use historical forms when the surroundings “demands” it.&lt;ref name="TILMAN" /&gt;

===The design value of restoration and preservation===
This is based on a commitment to preserve the best of buildings and products for future generations.&lt;ref name="POWELL, K. 1999" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ROSS"&gt;ROSS, M. (1996) Planning and the heritage: policy and procedures, London, E &amp; FN Spon.&lt;/ref&gt; This design value tends to represent restoring a building or product to its initial design and is usually rooted in three perspectives.&lt;ref&gt;TOMLAN, M. A. (2004) Historic preservation. IN SENNOTT, R. S. (Ed.) Encyclopedia of 20th-century architecture. New York, Fitzroy Dearborn.&lt;/ref&gt; These are: 
#An archaeological perspective (i.e. preserving buildings and products of historical interest).&lt;ref name="ROSS" /&gt;
#An artistic perspective i.e. a desire to preserve something of beauty.&lt;ref name="ROSS" /&gt;
#A social perspective (i.e. a desire to hold on to the familiar and reassuring).&lt;ref name="ROSS" /&gt;

===The vernacular design value===
This value is based on a belief that a simple life and its design, closely linked to nature, are superior to that of modernity.&lt;ref&gt;OLIVER, P. (2004) Vernacular Architecture. IN SENNOTT, R. S. (Ed.) Encyclopedia of 20th-century architecture. New York, Fitzroy Dearborn.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;MORTON, P. (2004) Primitivism. IN SENNOTT, R. S. (Ed.) Encyclopedia of 20th-century architecture. New York, Fitzroy Dearborn.&lt;/ref&gt; The design value of [[Vernacular architecture|Vernacular]] includes key concept such as: 
#Reinvigorating tradition (i.e. evoking the vernacular).
#Reinventing tradition i.e. the search for new paradigms.
#Extending tradition i.e. using the vernacular in a modified manner.
#Reinterpreting tradition i.e. the use of contemporary idioms.&lt;ref&gt;RUDOFSKY, B. (1964) Architecture without architects: a short introduction to non-pedigree architecture, New York, Doubleday.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gender-based design values==
This design values is closely linked to the feminist movement and theory developed within the 19th and 20th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;WEISMAN, L. K. (1992) Discrimination by design: a feminist critique of the man-made environment, Urbana, University of Illinois Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WEISMAN"&gt;WEISMAN, L. K. (2000) Prologue: 'women's environmental rights: a manifesto'. IN BORDEN, I., RENDELL, J. &amp; PENNER, B. (Eds.) Gender space architecture: an interdisciplinary introduction. London, Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; Design values based on gender are related to three tenets found in architecture and industrial design,&lt;ref&gt;ATTFIELD, J. (1989) Form/female follows function/male: Feminist critiques of design. IN WALKER, J. A. &amp; ATTFIELD, J. (Eds.) Design history and the history of design. London, Pluto.&lt;/ref&gt; which are: 
#Gender differences related to critique and reconstruction of architectural practice and history.&lt;ref name="MORTON"&gt;MORTON, P. (2004) Feminist Theory. IN SENNOTT, R. S. (Ed.) Encyclopedia of 20th-century architecture. New York, Fitzroy Dearborn.&lt;/ref&gt;
#The struggle for equal access to training, jobs and recognition in architecture and design.&lt;ref name="MORTON" /&gt;
#The focus on gender based theories for the built environment, the architectural discourse, and cultural value systems.&lt;ref name="MORTON" /&gt;

Designers that adhere to the Design values based on gender typically have a focus on creating buildings that do not have the same barriers that children, parents and the elderly experience in much of the built environment.&lt;ref name="WEISMAN" /&gt; It also implies a focus on aesthetics that are deemed to be more 'feminine' than the 'masculine' aesthetics often created by male designers.

==The economic design value==
Many architects and industrial designers often dread the financial and business side of architecture and industrial design practice, as their focus is often geared towards achieving successful design quality rather than achieving successful economic expectations.&lt;ref&gt;PYE, D. (1978) The nature and aesthetics of design, London, Barrie &amp; Jenkins.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;JACKSON, L. (Ed.) (1992) Strategic study of the profession: phase 1: strategic overview, London, Royal Institute of British Architects.&lt;/ref&gt;

This is the basis for a design value that can be characterised as 'voluntarism' or 'charrette ethos'.&lt;ref&gt;BLAU, J. R. (1984) Architects and firms: a sociological perspective on architectural practice, Cambridge, Massachusetts, MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; This value is commonly found among practising architects and designers. The 'volunteer' value is founded in the belief that good architecture and design requires commitment beyond the prearranged time, accountant’s budget, and normal hours.&lt;ref name="CUFF"&gt;CUFF, D. (1991) Architecture: the story of practice, Cambridge, Massachusetts, MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Implicit in the 'volunteer' value are elements of the following claim present: 
#Best design works comes from offices or individual designers which are willing to put in overtime (sometimes unpaid) for the sake of the design outcome.&lt;ref name="CUFF" /&gt;
#Good architecture and design is rarely possible within fees offered by clients.&lt;ref name="CUFF" /&gt;
#Architects and designers should care enough about buildings or products to uphold high design standards regardless of the payment offered.&lt;ref name="CUFF" /&gt;

The 'volunteer' design value can be seen as a reaction to and a rejection of the client’s influence and control over the design project.

==The novel design value==
It is common within contemporary architecture and industrial design to find emphasis on creating novel design solutions. This emphasis is often accompanied by an equally common lack of emphasis on studying of the appropriateness of any already existing design solution.&lt;ref&gt;PORTER, D. (2000) Why do architects wear black? thinking beyond the trap. IN TOFT, A. E. (Ed.) Ethics in architecture : architectural education in the epoch of virtuality. [Leuven], European Association for Architectural Education.&lt;/ref&gt;

The novel design value has historical roots dating back to early design movements such as [[Modernism]], with is emphasis on “starting from zero”.&lt;ref&gt;WOLFE, T. (1981) From bauhaus to our house, London, Picador.&lt;/ref&gt; The celebration of original and novel design solutions is, by many designers and design scholars, considered one of the main aspects of architecture and design. This design value is often manifested through the working methods of designers. Some architects and designers with their emphasis on the “big idea” will have a tendency to cling to major design ideas and themes, even if these themes and ideas are faced with insurmountable challenges.&lt;ref&gt;LAWSON, B. (1997) How designers think: the design process demystified, Oxford, Architectural Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;ROWE, P. G. (1987) Design thinking, Cambridge, Massachusetts, MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;CROSS, N. (2004) Expertise in design: an overview. Design Studies, 25, 427 - 441.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the emphasis on design novelty is also associated with progress and new design solutions that, without this emphasis, would not see the light of day.

The design value of novelty is not generally accepted within either architecture or design. This is indicated by the debate in architecture, focusing on whether buildings should harmonize with the surroundings in that they are situated in or not.&lt;ref&gt;COLLINS, P. (1971) Architectural judgement, London, Faber &amp; Faber.&lt;/ref&gt; Equally is the debate where architecture should be based on traditional topology and design styles i.e. classical and vernacular base architecture or if it should be an expression of its time. The same issues are indicated within the industrial design domain where it has been debated if retro design should be accepted or not as good design.

==Mathematical and scientific design values==
A movement to base architectural design on scientific and mathematical understanding started with the early work of [[Christopher Alexander]] in the 1960s, ''[[Notes on the synthesis of form]]''. Other contributors joined in, especially in investigations of form on the urban scale, which resulted in important developments such as Bill Hillier's [[Space syntax]] and Michael Batty's work on [[Spatial analysis]]. In architecture, the four-volume work [[The Nature of Order]] by Alexander summarizes his most recent results. An alternative architectural theory based on scientific laws, as for example [[A Theory of Architecture]]  is now competing with purely aesthetic theories most common in architectural academia.  This entire body of work can be seen as balancing and often questioning design movements that rely primarily upon aesthetics and novelty. At the same time, the scientific results that determine this approach in fact verify traditional and vernacular traditions in a way that purely historical appreciation cannot.

Social and environmental issues are given a new explanation, drawing upon biological phenomena and the interactivity of groups and individuals with their built environment. The new discipline of [[biophilia hypothesis|biophilia]] developed by [[E. O. Wilson]] plays a major role in explaining the human need for intimate contact with natural forms and living beings. This insight into the connection between human beings and the biological environment provides a new understanding for the need for ecological design. An extension of the biophilic phenomenon into artificial environments suggests a corresponding need for built structures that embody the same precepts as biological structures. These mathematical qualities include fractal forms, scaling, multiple symmetries, etc.. Applications and extensions of Wilson's original idea are now carried out by Stephen R. Kellert in the [[Biophilia hypothesis]], and in by [[Nikos Salingaros]] and others in the book "Biophilic Design".

Organized in 1989 by the BPI Foundation, Inc., the [[corporate social responsibility]] arm of the [[Bank of the Philippine Islands]] (BPI), with the [[Department of Science and Technology (Philippines)|Department of Science and Technology]] (DOST), the '''BPI-DOST Science Awards''' recognizes exceptional science and engineering students from partner-universities nationwide. These students are individuals whose efforts made them excel in specialized [[fields of science]] such as mathematics, physics, engineering, chemistry, biology, and computer science. The awardees are recognized for their potential contributions to industry and [[nation-building]], and are selected on the basis of their academic and research performance and nomination from the school.&lt;ref name="business.inquirer.net"&gt;[http://business.inquirer.net/money/announcements/view/20090316-194437/BPI-DOST-Science-Awards-marks-20-years BPI-DOST Science Awards marks 20 years] ''[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Selection process==
The preparation for the awards is a very long and tedious process. Every year in June, the BPI Foundation selects three entries from the 10 partner universities. By July all the invitations, materials, and all preparations are ready. Acceptance of formal nominations close in October. By February, all the preparations for the awarding ceremonies are completed.

Each year, the foundation gathers the three best entries from each of the 10 partner universities. These are [[Ateneo de Davao University]], [[Ateneo de Manila University]], [[De La Salle University]], [[Saint Louis University (Baguio)|Saint Louis University]], [[Silliman University]], [[University of the Philippines]] (Diliman and Los Baños), [[University of San Carlos]], [[University of Santo Tomas]], and [[Xavier University – Ateneo de Cagayan]].

To qualify, the nominee must be a Filipino citizen and a regular student majoring in the following fields: mathematics, physics, chemistry, engineering, computer science, and biology. The nominee must have a consistent and outstanding academic, leadership, and research record in their school.

The schools must submit their nominees to the BPI-DOST Science Committee.

The BPI handles the business feasibility of the research while DOST assesses the scientific aspect. From 30 research projects, the evaluators trim down the entries to 12 semifinalists. DOST again narrows them down to six finalists.

The finalists then undergo oral evaluation by a joint BPI-DOST panel of experts. The experts choose the winners of the Best Project of the Year Awards.

The main criteria for judging projects are adherence to scientific soundness, relevance and impact on knowledge advancement, commercial viability, and the originality of the study.

Winners get a P200,000 research grant, a P50,000 cash incentive and a trophy. First- and second-prize winners receive P30,000 and P10,000, respectively, and trophy each.

All the original 30 outstanding student awardees chosen get P25,000 cash prizes, trophies and an invitation to work as BPI junior officers.&lt;ref name="manilatimes.net"&gt;[http://www.manilatimes.net/national/2008/apr/02/yehey/top_stories/20080402top8.html] ''[[The Manila Times]]''. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081012043328/http://www.manilatimes.net/national/2008/apr/02/yehey/top_stories/20080402top8.html |date=October 12, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awardees==
From 1989 to 2004, equal awards were given to the top 3 candidates from each university. Note that awards were first given to candidates from Silliman University and Xavier University in 1990, and Ateneo de Davao University in 1994, and Saint Louis University in 1998.

The country of [[Indonesia]] consists of more than 17,000 islands and hundreds of different cultures. Each region has its own [[traditional costume]]. One of the unique traditional costumes worn in [[Bali]], [[East Nusa Tenggara]] (NTT) and the [[West Nusa Tenggara]] (NTB) islands located in the eastern region of Indonesia. The three areas were once a single province known as a [[Lesser Sunda Islands|Lesser Sunda]] (Bali, East and West Nusa Tenggara). Bali Nusra is a short form of Bali Nusa Tenggara Islands or [[Lesser Sunda Islands]]. And Tangi is a place in NTT.

==Indonesia cultural Wealth==
Traditional cultural wealth is a point of strength whereby people can improve their livelihoods, thus undoubtfully its preservation efforts must be supported. "Several efforts in preserving these things are presented through various exhibitions of local products such as tenun weaving, typical traditional culinary, and assortments of handicrafts from Bali, NTB and NTT," stated the Commander of Regional Military IX/Udayana Bali NTT NTB, Major General TNI Hotmangaradja Pandjaitan, moments after the pre-event opening. Bali Nusa Tenggara Tangi 2009 traditional cloth exhibition  is a result of this idea, a fashion event based on traditional cloth such as the tenun that is woven in Bali, NTB, and NTT, in cooperation with the [[Ministry of Culture and Tourism (Indonesia)|Indonesian Ministry of Culture and Tourism]], the Yayasan Cita Abdi Bangsa Foundation, and Rumah Pesona Kain.

==Tangi (Rise)==
Tangi, which means 'to rise', became the underlying theme of the Bali and Nusa Tenggara collective event. According to Pandjaitan, many local cultural products deserve to be presented to the international stage. The process of creating the crafts by hand with natural materials is something that deserves high regard. A number of programs enhancing the local cultural products of the three provinces included tenun ikat ([[weaving]]) competitions, handicraft exhibitions, and traditional culinary presentations from the three provinces, as well as presentations from the aforementioned national [[fashion designer]]s.Furthermore, worth praising were the displays of the various traditional [[handicrafts]] together with souvenirs, [[jewelry]] and interior décor that continues to win the favor of national and international markets. Also presented were the manual processes of traditional natural dyeing demonstrated by a West Nusa Tenggara local.

==Tenun (weaving) traditional cloth==
Various tenun [[Ikat|woven cloths]] from the three provinces were presented in a gallery layout where guests could examine the dazzling colors and motifs used throughout. A length of traditional Indonesian tenun is fully laden with traditional, sociological, artistic, and historical value, and tells of the developmental and enriching process of a certain community. As stated by Mrs.Tuti Pandjaitan,  the head of the Kartika Chandra Kirana Regional Military Command IX/Udayana Association of Army Wives, "On a piece of tenun cloth, one may find the dedication and resilience of the hands of crafters who create it. The artistic superiority of this traditional cloth presents a long journey in a diverse, rich and meaningful tradition." The tenun is an [[heirloom]], and its weaving processes will never change by replacing it with machinery. To weave a length of tenun requires a month or more to finalize.

Prior there were held competitions and workshops on tenun in Bali, NTB, and NTT. The judges were experts in the field of traditional tenun. "The purpose was to increase the quality and enrich the present materials and traditional designs in order to improve the people's welfare," added Tuti Pandjaitan.

Also present was Bali's Governor [[Made Mangku Pastika]] and NTT's Governor Frans Lebu Raya. The Governor of NTB welcomed the idea from the Regional Military Command IX/Udayana and hoped that it would continue to present other cultural forms, such as [[performing arts]]. The next possibility is an exhibition or similar event in the two other provinces, such as in [[Mataram (city)|Mataram]] (NTB) and [[Kupang]] (NTT). "This is giving momentum to elevate the nation's opus," he said.

==TNI Role in the traditional Cloth Exhibition==
Meanwhile, Hotmangardja Pandjaitan explained that the role of the TNI was most importantly to unite the [[cultural diversity]] of the archipelago. The TNI also feels responsible for keeping the territorial integrity of the nation, not only during wartimes but also through times of peace. The event held by Regional Military Command IX/Udayana together with the Department of Culture and Tourism aims to uphold national integrity. The event was also made possible due to the active role of the Army Wives' Association - Persatuan Istri Prajurit (Persit) Kartika Chandra Korem 161 Kupang, Korem 162 Mataram, and Korem 163 Bali. Several fashion designs were also presented by the soldiers and wives who paraded onto the catwalk that night.

The '''Bitard''' is a [[fabulous animal]]. It is the symbol of the ''{{Lang|fr|Ordre du Vénéré Bitard (Loué Soit-Il !)}}'' or Order of the Venerated Bitard (May He be Blessed!), a [[student association]] of [[University of Poitiers]] (France) created in the 1920s. The members themselves are also called '''Bitards''' and in some occasions they wear a cape colored according to their rank in the Order, along with a [[faluche]], the traditional French [[Student cap]]. The Bitards' faluche has the particularity of being decorated with a [[Chevron (insignia)|chevron]] and having its own code for the signification of insignias. The folklore of the Order refers to [[François Rabelais]] as the word ''{{Lang|fr|bitard}}'' appears twice in hunting outcomes in ''[[Gargantua and Pantagruel|Pantagruel]]''.&lt;ref name="EtudesRabel_2006"&gt;{{Cite journal|language=French|title=La chasse au Bitard des étudiants poitevins: Panurge bachelier |first1=C |last1=Escarmant |first2=JL |last2=Le Quellec |journal=Etudes rabelaisiennes |year=2006 |url=http://rupestre.on-rev.com/page0/page3/assets/EtudesRabel_2006.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each year, the Order organizes a one-week festival, called the ''{{Lang|fr|69&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt; Semaine estudiantine}}'' (69th Students' Week). Various festive activities happen during this week, including a procession,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite video|url=http://www.ina.fr/economie-et-societe/education-et-enseignement/video/RXF05005382/l-ordre-du-bitard-a-poitiers.fr.html |title=L'ordre du bitard à Poitiers |date=1968 |publisher=Institut national de l'audiovisuel |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; drinking events and a Bitard hunting.

[[Image:Edward Kynaston.jpg|thumb|right|[[Edward Kynaston]], one of the last boy players (1889 engraving of a contemporary portrait)]]
'''Boy player''' refers to male children, ranging in age from six or seven to their teens, who performed in [[Medieval theatre|Medieval]] and [[English Renaissance theatre|English Renaissance]] [[playing companies]]. Some boy players worked for the adult companies and performed the female roles, as women did not perform on the English stage in this period. Others worked for children's companies in which all roles, not just the female ones, were played by boys.&lt;ref&gt;Chambers, Vol. 2, pp. 1-76.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Halliday, pp. 35, 71, 98-101.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Children's companies==
In the [[Elizabethan era|Elizabethan]] and [[Jacobean era|Jacobean]] periods, troupes appeared that were composed entirely of boy players. They are famously mentioned in [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Hamlet]]'', in which a group of travelling actors has left the city due to rivalry with a troupe of "little eyases" (II, ii,339); the term "eyas" means an unfledged [[hawk]].&lt;ref&gt;G. Blakemore Evans, ed., ''The Riverside Shakespeare,'' Boston, Houghton Mifflin, 1974; p. 1156 n. 339.&lt;/ref&gt;

The children's companies grew out of the choirs of boy singers that had been connected with cathedrals and similar institutions since the [[Middle Ages]]. (Similar boy choirs exist to this day.) Thus the choir attached to [[St. Paul's Cathedral]] in [[London]] since the 12th century was in the 16th century molded into a company of child actors, the [[Children of Paul's]].&lt;ref&gt;Chambers, Vol. 2, pp. 8-22.&lt;/ref&gt; Similar groups of boy actors were connected with other institutions, including [[Eton College|Eton]], the [[Worshipful Company of Merchant Taylors|Merchant Taylors]] School, and the ecclesiastical college at [[Windsor, Berkshire|Windsor]].&lt;ref&gt;Chambers, Vol. 2, pp. 68-76.&lt;/ref&gt;

The boys were generally in the range of 8–12 years old (prepubescent boys are chosen as choirboys precisely because their voices have not yet "broken" with puberty). They were musically talented, strictly disciplined, educated in the [[Trivium (education)|trivium]] (grammar, logic, [[rhetoric]]), and sometimes fluent in Latin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hillebrand|first1=Harold Newcomb|title=The Child Actors: A Chapter in Elizabethan Stage History|date=1964|publisher=Russell &amp; Russel, Inc.|location=New York|page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The boys amounted to formidable competition for the companies of adult actors in Elizabethan England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gurr,|first1=Andrew|title=The Shakespearean stage 1574-1642|date=2009|publisher=Cambridge university press|location=Cambridge|isbn=9780521729666|page=46|edition=Fourth edition.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1558 and 1576 (the year [[James Burbage]] built [[The Theatre]] in London and the age of popular Elizabethan drama began), companies of boy actors performed 46 times at Court, versus only 32 times for companies of adult actors in the same period. The playwright [[John Lyly]] earned fame when his "Euphuistic" plays were acted at Court by the Children of Paul's in the 1580s.

The practice of children acting was never free of controversy, however (see Responses, below). In [[1590 in literature|1590]] theatrical performances by the Children of Paul's were suppressed, largely due to Lyly's involvement in the [[Marprelate controversy]]. Companies of child actors went out of fashion, and did not return for a decade.

In [[1600 in literature|1600]], however, the practice saw a resurgence: the [[Children of the Chapel]] performed at the private [[Blackfriars Theatre]] for much of the first decade of the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;Chambers, Vol. 2, pp. 23-60.&lt;/ref&gt; Their performances of the plays of [[Ben Jonson]] were especially popular, inspiring Shakespeare's lines about how the boys "carry it away...Hercules and his load too" in ''Hamlet,'' II, ii,360-2. (The [[Globe Theatre]] was decorated with a statue of [[Hercules]], the playhouse's symbol.) The Children of Paul's were also acting publicly once again at this time.

The children probably attained their greatest notoriety during the ''Poetomachia'' or [[War of the Theatres]] ([[1599 in literature|1599]]&amp;ndash;[[1601 in literature|1601]]). Two troupes were intimately involved on the competing sides: the Children of Paul's acted [[John Marston (poet)|John Marston]]'s ''[[Jack Drum's Entertainment]]'' (1600) and ''[[What You Will]]'' (1601) and [[Thomas Dekker (poet)|Thomas Dekker]]'s ''[[Satiromastix]]'' (1601), while the Children of the Chapel had Jonson's ''[[Cynthia's Revels]]'' (1600) and ''[[The Poetaster]]'' (1601).

The boys' troupes were strongly associated with the satirical comedy of Jonson, Marston, and [[Thomas Middleton]], which has sometimes been described as a coterie drama for gentleman "wits," in contrast to the popular drama of writers like Shakespeare and [[Thomas Heywood]] that was performed at the Globe and the other large public theatres. Yet the boys also played serious tragedies and contemporary histories, notably the works of [[George Chapman]] &amp;mdash; ''[[Bussy D'Ambois]],'' ''[[The Revenge of Bussy D'Ambois]]'', and the double play ''[[The Conspiracy and Tragedy of Charles, Duke of Byron]]''. Modern readers and theatergoers can only wonder what these productions were like.   

The brand of coterie drama practiced by Jonson and others was often controversial, however; the official displeasure that greeted the play ''[[Eastward Ho]]'', which landed two of its authors in jail, also fell upon the boys who performed it. By [[1606 in literature|1606]] the Children of Paul's had ceased performing, and the Children of the Chapel were no longer associated with the Royal Chapel and had lost royal patronage; they became merely the Children of the Blackfriars. The boys' troupes had ceased public dramatic performance and the fashion died out by about 1615. The [[Lady Elizabeth's Men]] was a new company granted a patent on April 27, [[1611 in literature|1615]], under the patronage of King James' daughter [[Elizabeth of Bohemia|Princess Elizabeth]]; it was composed, to some significant degree, of veterans of the children's companies, now grown to manhood.&lt;ref&gt;Chambers, Vol. 2, pp. 246-60.&lt;/ref&gt;

While controversial in their time, the children's companies had been effective in funnelling talented, educated, and experienced young actors into the adult companies. To recapture this influence, [[Richard Gunnell]] attempted to start a children's company with 14 boys and several adults when he built the [[Salisbury Court Theatre]] in [[1629 in literature|1629]]. The enterprise was not a success, because of a long closure of the theatres due to plague soon after its inception; but it did produce [[Stephen Hammerton]], who went on to act with the King's Men, and became an early [[matinee idol]] among young women in the audience for his romantic leads.&lt;ref&gt;[[Andrew John Gurr|Andrew Gurr]], ''The Shakespearean Stage,'' pp. 63-4&lt;/ref&gt; 

A limited renewal of the practice of children's companies came in [[1637 in literature|1637]], when [[Christopher Beeston]] established, under royal warrant, the King and Queen's Young Company, colloquially called [[Beeston's Boys]]. The intent was in part to have a structure for training young actors &amp;mdash; much as the choirs of the previous century had provided educated and capable talent (though the actors in Beeston's company tended to be older than the boys of the earlier troupes). After the elder Beeston's death in 1638, his son [[William Beeston]] continued the company, with uneven success, till the theatres closed in 1642; he even managed to re-form Beeston's Boys for a time once the theatres re-opened in the [[Restoration comedy|Restoration]].

==Boys in adult companies==
In [[playing company|playing companies]] of adult actors, boys were initially given the female parts, but women were permitted to act on the stage from December [[1661 in literature|1661]]. A law against women on stage was implemented in England until that time.&lt;ref&gt;''Women Waging Law in Elizabethan England''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1998. 304 pp&lt;/ref&gt; Pre-pubescent boys were used for their unbroken voices, an accepted practice.

Boy actors in adult companies apparently served as apprentices, in ways comparable to the practices of other guilds and trades of the age, though for shorter terms &amp;mdash; perhaps two or three years instead of the usual seven. (The companies of adult actors were, in Elizabethan legal terms, retainers in noble households, and thus not subject to the legal statutes governing apprentices.){{fact|date=January 2014}}&lt;ref&gt;Individual actors sometimes maintained membership in guilds, precisely for the legal right to maintain apprentices. [[John Heminges]] was a member of the grocer's guild throughout his life, and [[Ben Jonson]] renewed his membership in the bricklayer's guild in 1599...but probably not because they were enthusiastic about greengrocering and bricklaying. [[Andrew Cane]], however, was an active goldsmith and a member of the Goldsmith's Company as well as the leading clown of [[Prince Charles's Men]] in the 1630s; and he turned his goldsmith's apprentices John Wright Arthur Savill into boy players with the company. Both appeared in [[Shackerley Marmion]]'s ''[[Holland's Leaguer]]'' in December [[1631 in literature|1631]].{{fact|date=January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; They performed female roles (and, of course, roles of male children if required) alongside adult male actors playing men or older female parts. In reference to [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare's]] company, variously the [[Lord Chamberlain's Men]] (1594&amp;ndash;1603) or the [[King's Men (playing company)|King's Men]] (1603 and after): [[Augustine Phillips]] left bequests to an apprentice, [[King's Men personnel|James Sands]], and a former apprentice, [[King's Men personnel|Samuel Gilburne]], in his will, read after his death in 1605; company members [[William Ostler]], [[John Underwood (actor)|John Underwood]], [[Nathan Field]], and [[King's Men personnel|John Rice]] had all started their acting careers as [[Children of the Chapel]] at the [[Blackfriars Theatre]].

==Boys playing female roles==
One question has persisted: did boys play ''all'' female roles in [[English Renaissance theatre]], or were some roles, the most demanding ones, played by adult males? Some literary critics and some ordinary readers have found it incredible that the most formidable and complex female roles created by [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] and [[John Webster|Webster]] could have been played by "children." The available evidence is incomplete and occasionally ambiguous; however, the overall implication is that even the largest roles were played by boys or young men, not mature adults. In a recent detailed survey of the evidence for the ages of boy actors and their roles, scholar David Kathman concludes that "No significant evidence supports the idea that such roles were played by adult sharers but a wealth of specific evidence demonstrates that they were played by adolescent boys no older than about twenty-one".&lt;ref&gt;David Kathman, "How Old Were Shakespeare's Boy Actors?" in ''Shakespeare Survey'' 58 (2006), p. 246.&lt;/ref&gt; There are only two possible examples of adult actors playing female roles. The first appears in the cast list for [[John Fletcher (playwright)|John Fletcher]]'s ''[[The Wild Goose Chase]]'', in which the veteran comedian [[John Shank]] is listed; the entry reads "Petella, their waiting-woman. Their Servant Mr. ''Shanck''."  However, Kathman argues that this refers to two roles, not one: Shank did not play Petella, but a comic servant who appears later in the play.&lt;ref&gt;Kathman, 234.&lt;/ref&gt; The second example is the cast list for [[Thomas Heywood]]'s ''[[The Fair Maid of the West]]'', in which [[Anthony Turner (actor)|Anthony Turner]] apparently played the tiny role of a kitchen maid. Kathman suspects this is merely a misprint, but concludes that even if Turner did play this role, there remains no evidence for adults playing leading roles.&lt;ref&gt;Kathman, 238.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many boy actors filled female roles for a few years, then switched to male roles. An example: [[John Honyman]] started playing female roles for the [[King's Men (playing company)|King's Men]] at the age of 13, in [[1626 in literature|1626]], in [[Philip Massinger]]'s ''[[The Roman Actor]]''. He played females for the next three years, through the King's Men's productions of [[Lodowick Carlell]]'s ''[[The Deserving Favourite]]'' and Massinger's ''[[The Picture (Massinger play)|The Picture]]'' (both in [[1629 in literature|1629]]). Yet in 1630, at the age of 17, Honyman switched to male roles and never returned to female roles. Other boy players with the King's Men, [[John Thompson (actor)|John Thompson]] and [[Richard Sharpe (actor)|Richard Sharpe]], appear to have played women for a decade or more, to the point at which they must have been "young men" rather than "boys." [[Theophilus Bird]] played a woman when he was in his early 20s; but then he too switched to male roles.

Audience members occasionally recorded positive impressions of the quality of the acting of boy players. When one Henry Jackson saw the King's Men perform ''[[Othello]]'' at Oxford in 1610, he wrote of the cast's Desdemona in his diary, "She [sic] always acted the matter very well, in her death moved us still more greatly; when lying in bed she implored the pity of those watching with her countenance alone."&lt;ref&gt;Translated from the original Latin; Michael Shapiro, "The Introduction of Actresses in England: Delay or Defensiveness?," in Comensoli and Russell, p. 185.&lt;/ref&gt; The mere fact that Jackson referred to the boy as "she," when he certainly knew better rationally, may in itself testify to the strength of the illusion.

==Responses==
Many [[Puritan]] preachers, who hated the theatre in general, were outraged by the use of boy players, which they believed encouraged homosexual lust. In [[1583 in literature|1583]], [[Philip Stubbes]] complained that plays were full of "such wanton gestures, such bawdy speeches...such kissing and bussing" that playgoers would go home together "very friendly...and play the sodomites, or worse."&lt;ref&gt;Philip Stubbes, ''The Anatomy of Abuses'' (1583), quoted in Bruce R. Smith, ed. ''Twelfth Night: Texts and Contexts'' (New York: Bedford St Martin's, 2001), p. 275.&lt;/ref&gt; John Rainolds warned of the "filthy sparkles of lust to that vice the putting of women's attire on men may kindle in unclean affections."&lt;ref&gt;John Rainolds, ''The Overthrow of Stage Playes'' ([[1599 in literature|1599]]), quoted in Smith, ''Twelfth Night'', p. 276&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to such comments, the actor-playwright [[Thomas Heywood]] protested that audiences were capable of distancing themselves: "To see our youths attired in the habit of women, who knows not what their intents be? Who cannot distinguish them by their names, assuredly knowing they are but to represent such a lady, at such a time appointed?"&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Heywood, ''An Apology for Actors'' ([[1612 in literature|1612]]), quoted in Smith, ''Twelfth Night'', p. 276&lt;/ref&gt;

==Famous boy players==
*[[Christopher Beeston]] was perhaps the greatest success story among the child actors (at least in worldly terms). He continued his acting career into his maturity, became a theatre manager, and by the 1620s and '30s was arguably the most influential man in the world of London theatre.
*[[Nathan Field]] was another success story of the children's companies. In ''[[Bartholomew Fair (play)|Bartholomew Fair]]'', Jonson hailed him as the "best" of the young actors ("Which is your best actor, your Field?"). As an adult, Field acted with the King's Men, and wrote creditable plays as well.
*Solomon Pavy became one of the Children of the Chapel in 1600, at the age of ten. He acted in Jonson's ''Cynthia's Revels'' and ''The Poetaster.'' When he died prematurely in 1603, Jonson wrote an epitaph for him, praising Pavy's talent for playing old men.
*[[Alexander Cooke]] was the boy who is thought to have created many of Shakespeare's heroines on stage. He remained with the King's Men as an adult actor.
*[[Joseph Taylor (17th-century actor)|Joseph Taylor]] graduated from the Children of the Chapel, via [[Lady Elizabeth's Men]] and the Duke of York's/[[Prince Charles' Men]], to replace [[Richard Burbage]] as the leading man of the King's Men. He played Hamlet, Othello, and all the major Shakespearean roles.
*[[Stephen Hammerton]] was a prominent boy actor with the King's Men in the last decade of English Renaissance theatre, 1632&amp;ndash;42.
*[[Hugh Clark (actor)|Hugh Clark]] was a noted boy player in the 1625&amp;ndash;30 period.
*[[Charles Hart (17th-century actor)|Charles Hart]] started out as a boy player with the King's Men, earning fame for his portrayal of the Duchess in [[James Shirley|Shirley's]] [[The Cardinal (play)|''The Cardinal'']] ([[1641 in literature|1641]]). He became a leading man and a star of the stage during the Restoration.
*[[Theophilus Bird]] started as a boy player; like Hart he resumed his career as an adult actor when the theatres re-opened in 1660.
*[[Edward Kynaston]] was the last prominent boy actor; he worked during the [[Restoration comedy|Restoration]].

==In film, literature and theatre==
The boy player has been a popular subject in literary, theatrical and cinematic representations of the Elizabethan theatre.
*The film ''[[Shakespeare in Love]]'' features a boy player (played by [[Daniel Brocklebank]]) who performs Juliet in ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' before being ousted by [[Gwyneth Paltrow]]'s character (who is disguised as a man).
*[[Nicholas Wright (playwright)|Nicholas Wright]]'s play ''[[Cressida (play)|Cressida]]'' is set in the 1630s and depicts the friendship between an elderly former boy player and the historical boy player [[Stephen Hammerton]].
*The play and film ''[[Stage Beauty]]'' are about the Restoration boy player [[Edward Kynaston]] and the transition to female acting.
*[[Anthony Burgess]]'s novel about Christopher Marlowe, ''[[A Dead Man in Deptford]]'', is narrated by a boy player.
*[[Tom Stoppard]]'s film of ''[[Rosencrantz &amp; Guildenstern Are Dead]]'' features a scene in which the eponymous duo are briefly convinced of the femininity of a boy player.
*[[Susan Cooper]]'s novel ''[[King of Shadows]]'' deals with boy actors including [[Nathan Field]].

'''''Chronos''''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|r|ɒ|n|oʊ|s}} {{respell|KRON|ohs}})&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Chronos|title=Chronos|work=[[Dictionary.com]] Unabridged|publisher=[[Random House]]|accessdate=July 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a 1985 [[abstract film]] directed by [[Ron Fricke]], created with custom-built [[time-lapse]] cameras. Originally released in [[IMAX]] theaters, it is now available on [[DVD]], [[Blu-ray]] and [[HD DVD]].

==Synopsis==
''Chronos'' is 42 minutes long and has no actors or dialogue. The soundtrack consists of a single continuous piece by composer [[Michael Stearns]]. Filmed in dozens of locations on five continents, the film relates to the concept of time passing on different scales—the bulk of the film covers the history of civilization, from pre-history to Egypt to Rome to [[Late Antiquity]] to the rise of Western Europe in the [[Middle Ages]] to the [[Renaissance]] to the modern era. It centers on European themes but not exclusively. Other time scales include the passing of seasons, and the passing of night and day, and the passing shadows of the sun in an afternoon to the passing of people on the street. These themes are intermingled with [[symbol|symbolic meaning]].

==Background==
''Chronos'' shares its particular style with the film ''[[Koyaanisqatsi]]'' (1983), for which [[Ron Fricke]] was the [[cinematographer]], as well as his later films ''Sacred Site'' and ''[[Baraka (film)|Baraka]]'' (1992). The theme of the film is "the celebration of life", and does not include the themes of [[Technology and society|technology as the culprit for society]] or "life out of balance", which were present in ''Koyaanisqatsi''. ''[[American Cinematographer]]'' described the film as "a musical poem praising the evolution of [[Western world|Western]] man from [[Cairo]] to [[Los Angeles]]."&lt;ref name="untold"/&gt; The film was produced by Canticle Films, a production company founded by Fricke. Funding for ''Chronos'' came from the [[seed money]] acquired through the publicity surrounding the production of ''Koyaanisqatsi''.&lt;ref name="untold"/&gt;

Fricke designed and built a [[70 mm film|65&amp;nbsp;mm]] camera for the film, which included a [[motion control photography|motion control]] system for the film's cinematography.&lt;ref name="untold"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Untold Tales of ''Koyaanisqatsi''|journal=[[American Cinematographer]]|first=Ron|last=Gold|date=March 1984|volume=65|issue=3|page=74}}&lt;/ref&gt; The director also used the system in his later films.

Michael Stearns, while composing the soundtrack for the film, used a custom-made instrument called "[[Blaster Beam|The Beam]]" to generate many of the sounds he required. The Beam was {{convert|12|ft|m}} long, made of [[extruded]] [[aluminum]] with 24 piano strings of gauge 19-22.

The name of the film comes from the [[Ancient Greek]] word ''χρόνος'', ''krònos'', which means ''time'' and is also the source to many modern terms related to time, such as [[chronology]], [[synchronous]] etc.

'''Copy''' refers to written material, in contrast to photographs or other elements of layout, in a large number of contexts, including magazines, advertising, and books.

In [[advertising]], web marketing and similar fields, ''copy'' refers to the output of [[Copywriting|copywriters]], who are employed to write material which encourages [[consumer]]s to buy goods or services.

In [[publishing]] more generally, the term ''copy'' refers to the text in [[books]], magazines, and newspapers. In books, it means the text as written by the author, which the [[copy editing|copy editor]] then prepares for [[typesetting]] and [[printing]]. This is also referred to as "editorial copy", which is said to have two subdivisions, the body copy and the adjuncts to the body copy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=English Media Texts Past and Present: Language and textual structure|last=Ungerer|first=Friedrich|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company|year=2000|isbn=9027250995|location=Philadelphia, PA|pages=135}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term's usage can be demonstrated in the way an [[Editing|editor]] decides to embed an advertising material directly into the editorial copy, which means that the ad would use the same [[font]], [[Page layout|layout]] presentation, feel of the editorial copy it is being integrated into.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Explorations in Critical Studies of Advertising|last=Hamilton|first=James|last2=Bodle|first2=Robert|last3=Korin|first3=Ezequiel|publisher=Routledge|year=2017|isbn=9781138649521|location=New York|pages=61}}&lt;/ref&gt; This concept underscores how the copy can also refer to the identity of the newspaper or the magazine since the method of composition and layout can define its brand and positioning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=How to Start a Magazine: And Publish It Profitably|last=Kobak|first=James|publisher=M. Evans and Company, Inc.|year=2002|isbn=9780871319272|location=New York|pages=119}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In newspapers and magazines, "body copy" is the main article or text that [[writer]]s are responsible for, is contrasted with "display copy",  accompanying material such as [[headline]]s and [[Photo caption|caption]]s, which are usually written by copy editors or sub-editors.

==Name==
Croatian checkerboard or chequy and sometimes known as Croatian chessboard is translated from Croatian ''šahovnica'' (from ''šah'', "chess"). ''Kockovlje'' and ''kockice'' (both from ''kocka'', "cube") are often referred to Croatian checkerboard which is incorrect because checkerboard is made from [[geometric shapes]] and not from 3D [[Mathematical objects|geometric objects]].

==History==
===Origin===
There is a legend probably from the 10th century, telling how Croatian [[Stephen Držislav of Croatia|king Držislav]] (named King Solomon), captured by the  [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]], played a [[chess]] match in which his opponent was Ducar II Orseolo. He got all three parties and thus gained freedom, and in some versions, power over the [[Dalmatia]]n cities. Then he put the [[chessboard]] in his [[coat of arms]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Legenda o nastanku hrvatskog grba - mojapovijest.com|url=http://www.mojapovijest.com/legenda-o-nastanku-hrvatskog-grba/|accessdate=20 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hrvatska šahovnica - povijest i njegovo značenje|url=https://hrvatska-istina.jimdo.com/novosti/hrvatska-sahovnica-povijest-i-njegovo-znacenje/|accessdate=20 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Legende o hrvatskom grbu - Povijest.hr|url=http://povijest.hr/drustvo/kultura/legende-o-hrvatskom-grbu/|accessdate=20 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Use in coat of arms===
[[File:Fragment iz crkvice sv Ivana od Nimfeja, Pula, poč. 9. st.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Fragment from the church of St. John of Nimfa]]
One of the oldest coats of arms of the Croatian kingdom from 1495 is located in the [[List of cities and towns in Austria| Austrian town]] of [[Innsbruck]] and is located on the front of the temple hall of Herzog-Friedrichstrasse 35. It is assumed that the creation of the Croatian coat of arms was stimulated by the emperor [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]]. from whose time it originated the coat of arms of Innsbruck, but also some other coats of arms, preserved in today's [[Germany]] and [[Austria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=HERALDIČARI I POVIJESNA ZNANOST NE MOGU SE NAČUDITI OPTUŽBAMA DA JE PRVO BIJELO POLJE ZLOČINAČKO Je li hrvatski grb iz 1495. - USTAŠKI?!|url=http://www.jutarnji.hr/vijesti/hrvatska/heraldicari-i-povijesna-znanost-ne-mogu-se-nacuditi-optuzbama-da-je-prvo-bijelo-polje-zlocinacko-je-li-hrvatski-grb-iz-1495.-ustaski/5322007/|accessdate=20 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=KAKO SRUŠITI CRKVU SV.

For this reason, it would not be strange that he had just spurred the emergence of a Croatian chess coat, if it did not exist before. The [[Habsburgs]], however, became Hungarian-Croatian kings only a few decades later, so it is more likely that the then rulers [[Jagiellonian dynasty|Jagelovići]] were to commemorate the use of that coat-of-arms.

In some quotations it is mentioned that the white color indicates [[White Croatia]] and [[Red Croatia]]. There is also a belief in the meaning of the color of the first field in the coat of arms, according to which the first white field is the independence of Croatia, and the first red field is its subordinate position, but this belief of the newer date does not have any confirmation in the earlier surrender. What would mean that Croatia today is in a subordinate position that is far from the truth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Flags Symbolizing Hatred - Journey East|url=https://christinebednarz.wordpress.com/2009/12/14/239/|accessdate=20 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=THE STORY BEHIND THE CHECKERS (AND A FEW LINES ON EMBLEMS AS WELL)|url=http://www.croatia-times.com/the-zagreb-times/the-story-behind-the-checkers-and-a-few-lines-on-emblems-as-well/|accessdate=20 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hrvatska šahovnica - povijest i njegovo značenje|url=https://hrvatska-istina.jimdo.com/novosti/hrvatska-sahovnica-povijest-i-njegovo-znacenje/|accessdate=20 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other uses==
Typical red-white checkerboard is widely used on [[airport]]s because of its recognizability and visibility. Checkerboard is used on roofs, [[water tower]]s and other buildings around the airports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why do many airports have red and white checkered structures?|url=https://www.quora.com/Why-do-many-airports-have-red-and-white-checkered-structures|accessdate=20 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why is everything in Airports painted with red and white checks?.|url=https://cockpitvoice.wordpress.com/2015/11/01/why-is-everything-in-airports-painted-with-red-and-white-checks/|accessdate=20 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the use is not directly connected to national symbol of Croatia and Croats. Croatian [[Croatian Air Force and Air Defence|Air Force MiG-21 UMD]] is painted in red-white Croatian checkerboard. [[Jersey (clothing)|Jerseys]] in sport events that use Croatian checkerboard are widely used by Croatian [[Fan (person)|sport fan]]s. Croatian checkerboard can be seen on various objects as a decoration.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5906">[[File:The Cross of Justin II.jpg|thumb|Front side of the Cross of Justin II]]
The '''''Cross of Justin II''''' (also known as '''''Crux Vaticana''''', [[Latin]] for "Vatican Cross") is a [[processional cross]] dating from the sixth century that is kept in the Treasury in [[St. Peter's Basilica]], in Vatican City. It is also a one of the oldest surviving claimed [[reliquary|reliquaries]] of the [[True Cross]], if not the oldest.&lt;ref name="ap"&gt;Vatican/Associated Press, November 2009&lt;/ref&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=August 2018}} It is a ''[[crux gemmata]]'' or jewelled cross, [[silver-gilt]] and adorned with jewels in gold settings, given to the people of Rome by the [[Roman Emperor]] [[Justin II]], who reigned from 565 to 578, and his co-ruler and wife, the Empress [[Sophia (empress)|Sophia]]. 

The cross bears a Latin inscription reading: ''ligno quo Christus humanum subdidit hostem dat Romae Iustinus opem et socia decorem'' which is commonly mistranslated as "For the wood [of the cross] with which human Christ was overcome by the enemy, Justin [and his consort?] give Rome this wealth and decoration"&lt;ref&gt;McClanan, 166&lt;/ref&gt;  A more accurate reading is: "With the wood with which Christ conquered man's enemy, Justin gives his help to Rome and his wife offers the ornamentation." &lt;ref name="ap"/&gt;  To mark the end of restoration and conservation work on the cross, it was placed on display in the main [[Basilica of Saint Peter's]] from November 2009 to April 12, 2010.&lt;ref name="ap"/&gt;

==Description==
[[File:Crocetta d'oro longobarda con moneta di giustino II, da novara, VI-VIII sec..JPG|thumb|A different, and far humbler, small cross of gold foil, with rubbings of coins of [[Justin II]] and holes for nails or thread, Italian, 6th century]] 
The original portion of the cross, which is now mounted on a much later stand, is 15.75&amp;nbsp;inches high and 11.81&amp;nbsp;inches wide, excluding the spike at the bottom for fitting into its stand.  The cross was restored in 2009; it has been altered and restored at several points in its history, including reducing its size.&lt;ref name="ap"/&gt;

The front of the cross has no figurative images: in the centre is a medallion containing the relic, which is itself displayed as cross-shaped.  The centres of the arms carry the inscriptions, and the edges of the arms jewels in set in gold, with four jewels hanging from the arms as [[pendilia]].  The reverse side is decorated in [[repoussé]] silver, and shows an interesting transitional stage in the decoration of the cross.  At the period the church was starting to encourage representation of the human figure of [[Christ]] on the cross, making a [[crucifix]], which [[Crucifixion in the arts|had previously not been usual]].  The central medallion shows the [[Lamb of God]], a common older formula.  Above and below this are images in medallions of Christ (the lower one may be [[John the Baptist]] instead).  The upper one shows Christ holding a book,&lt;ref&gt;Vatican Museums&lt;/ref&gt; representing the [[Gospel]]s, which was to become a standard feature of the image of [[Christ Pantocrator]]; in the lower one Christ or John has a blessing gesture.  At the ends of the arms, where the [[Virgin Mary]] and Saint [[John the Evangelist]] would often be found in later crucifixes, are instead portraits in medallions of Justin and his empress Sophia.&lt;ref&gt;McClanan, 167-8&lt;/ref&gt;    Between the medallions there are decorative foliage scrolling motifs, on the upright centred on onion-like plants probably intended as palm-trees.&lt;ref&gt;Illustrated Cotsonis, 58&lt;/ref&gt;

==Date==
In 569, Justin and Sophia together reportedly sent a relic of the [[True Cross]] to the [[Franks|Frankish]] princess [[Radegund]], who founded a monastery at [[Poitiers]] to house it. The event was commemorated in ''[[Vexilla Regis]]'' by [[Venantius Fortunatus]]. They are also recorded as sending relics to [[Pope John III]] (reigned 561-574) in an attempt to improve relations – the Crux Vaticana very likely dates from John's reign, perhaps around 568 or 569.&lt;ref&gt;McClanan, 167&lt;/ref&gt;   Older scholars thought, mainly on the basis of imperial head-dress, that [[Justin I]] (r. 518-27) and his empress [[Euphemia (empress)|Euphemia]] were the donors, but this view seems now rejected.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/secondary/BURLAT/15A*.html J. B. Bury, ''History of the Later Roman Empire''], Macmillan &amp; Co., Ltd., 1923, which still expresses this view, originally from the German scholar Delbrück&lt;/ref&gt;

{{No footnotes|date=August 2010}}
'''Dream sharing''' is the process of  documenting or discussing both night and day dreams with others. One of the primary purposes of sharing dreams is [[dream interpretation]].

The sharing of dreams dates back at least as far as 4000-3000 BC in permanent form on clay tablets. In ancient Egypt, dreams were among the items recorded in the form of hieroglyphics. In ancient Egyptian culture dream sharing had a religious context as priests doubled as dream interpreters.

Those whose dreams were especially vivid or significant were thought to be blessed and were given special status in these ancient societies.  Likewise, people who were able to interpret dreams were thought to receive these gifts directly from the gods, and they enjoyed a special status in society as well.

The respect for dreams changed radically early in the 19th century, and dreams in that era were often dismissed as reactions to anxiety, outside noises or even bad food and indigestion. During this period of time, dreams were thought to have no meaning at all, and interest in dream interpretation all but evaporated. This all changed, however, with the arrival of [[Sigmund Freud]] later in the 19th century. Freud stunned the world of psychiatry by stressing the importance of dreams, and he revived the once dead art of dream interpretation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4471">An '''eye poke''', '''eye jab''', '''eye stab''', '''eye strike''' or '''poke in the eye''' is a strike at the eye or eyes of a human or animal.  It is typically made with the fingers which may either be forked to jab both eyes or held together, like a bird's beak, to strike with force and protect the fingers from damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |chapter=The Eye Jab |page=60 |title=Martial Arts Techniques for Law Enforcement |author=Mike Young |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-8048-3794-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |page=32 |title=Complete Krav Maga |chapter=Eye Strike |author=Darren Levine, John Whitman |year=2007 |isbn=978-1-56975-573-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The attack became better known among the public due to its use in comedy; the idea of using it to entertain was likely invented by the [[vaudeville]]  duo of [[Joe Weber (vaudevillian)|Joe Weber]] and [[Lew Fields]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Epstein|first=Lawrence J.|title=Mixed nuts: America's love affair with comedy teams : from Burns and Allen to Belushi and Aykroyd|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8g6YQTuBYQ8C&amp;pg=PA34|year=2004|publisher=PublicAffairs|location=New York|isbn=1-58648-190-8|page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sports==
In sporting events, a losing fighter will sometimes break the rules, and poke someone in the eye leading to the fight be ended as "no decision," thus preventing them from taking a loss.&lt;ref name="yahoo1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Holden |first=Eric |url=https://sports.yahoo.com/news/ufc-address-eye-poke-issue-wake-wagner-prados-145700724--mma.html |title=How Should the UFC Address the "Eye Poke" Issue in the Wake of Wagner Prado's Fight at UFC on Fox 4?

==Self defense==
In a street fight situation, when one's opponent may be trying to inflict serious harm, martial arts expert [[Kelly McCann]] advises that the eyes should be a "persistent primary target".&lt;ref name = "kelly"/&gt; An eye poke needs little power to be effective, and it can stop even highly determined attackers. If the hand is kept at an approximately 45° angle to the opponent's face during the strike, there is less risk of hurting ones fingers, and even if they do not connect with the eye, the palm can impact on the opponent's face.&lt;ref name = "kelly"&gt;''Combatives for street survival '', by [[Kelly McCann]], Black Belt Books, {{ISBN|0-89750-176-4}}, (2010, second edition) p 126&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- Perhaps not a well known source to the average academic, this is considered one of the most authoritative books on street fighting, its been enthusiastically endorsed by celebrated warriors including [[Alfred M.

==Comedy==
The eye poke was a signature move in the [[slapstick]] antics of the comedy and vaudeville act [[The Three Stooges]], who mastered the technique.

'''Fiestas Patrias''' ({{Lang-en|Patriotic Holidays}})  in [[Mexico]] originated in the 19th century and are observed today as five [[public holiday]]s.

==Aniversario de la Constitución==
This day ({{Lang-en|"Anniversary of the Constitution"}}) commemorates the Constitution of 1917, promulgated after the [[Mexican Revolution]] on February 5.  Article 74 of the Mexican federal labor law (''Ley Federal del Trabajo'') provides that the first Monday of February (regardless of the date) will be an official holiday in Mexico marking this occasion.  This was a modification of the law made in 2005, effective since 2006; before that, it was celebrated on February 5 regardless of the day of the week in which the date occurred.

==Natalicio de Benito Juárez==
This day ({{Lang-en|Birth of Benito Juárez}}) commemorates President [[Benito Juárez]]'s birthday on March 21, 1806. Juárez is popularly regarded as an exemplary politician because of his liberal policies that, among other things, defined the traditionally strict separation of the church and the Mexican state. Article 74 of the Mexican labor law (''Ley Federal del Trabajo'') provides that the third Monday of March (regardless the date) will be an official holiday in Mexico. As with Constitution Day, the holiday was originally celebrated every year on the same date (March 21), but the federal labor law was modified in 2005 so the holiday is always celebrated on a Monday.

==Labor Day==
''Día del Trabajo'' ({{Lang-en|Labor Day}}) commemorates the Mexican workers' union movements on May 1 &amp;mdash; specifically, the 1906 [[Cananea, Sonora]], and the 1907 [[Río Blanco, Veracruz]], labor unrest and repression.

==Grito de Dolores and Aniversario de la Independencia==
{{main|Grito de Dolores}}
''Grito de Dolores'' (on the evening of September 15) and ''Aniversario de la Independencia'' (September 16) commemorate Father [[Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla]]'s ''[[Grito de Dolores]]'' &amp;mdash; on September 16, 1810, in the village of [[Dolores Hidalgo|Dolores]], near [[Guanajuato, Guanajuato|Guanajuato]]. Hidalgo called for the end of Spanish rule in Mexico. On October 18, 1825, the Republic of Mexico officially declared September 16 its national Independence Day (''Dia de la Independencia'').

Mexican Independence day, also referred to as ''Dieciséis de septiembre'', is celebrated from the evening of September 15 with a re-creation of the ''Grito de Dolores'' by all executive office-holders (from the [[President of Mexico|President of the Republic]] down to [[municipal president]]s) and lasts through the night.

==Aniversario de la Revolución==
{{Main|Revolution Day (Mexico)}}
This day commemorates the [[Mexican Revolution]] which started on November 20, 1910 when [[Francisco I. Madero]] planned an uprising against dictator [[Porfirio Díaz]]'s 31-year-long iron rule. Article 74 of the Mexican labor law (''Ley Federal del Trabajo'') provides that the third Monday of November (regardless the date) will be an official holiday in Mexico.  This was a modification of the law made in 2005, effective since 2006; before then, it was November 20 regardless of the day, and all schools gave extended holidays if the day was a Tuesday or Thursday. Although November 20 is the official day, the uprising started on different days in different parts of the country.

==Confusion regarding Cinco de mayo==
Contrary to common misconception in the U.S.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Lauren Effron|publisher=Discovery News | title=Cinco de Mayo:NOT Mexico's Independence Day|date=2010-05-10|accessdate=2010-09-16|url=http://news.discovery.com/history/cinco-de-mayo-not-mexicos-independence-day.html|quote=Contrary to popular belief, Cinco de Mayo is not the celebration of Mexico's independence day.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Julia Leyton|title=How Cinco de Mayo Works|publisher=HowStuffWorks.com | date=2003-04-26|accessdate=2010-09-16|url=http://tlc.howstuffworks.com/family/cinco-de-mayo.htm|quote=Lots of us have heard of the Mexican holiday Cinco de Mayo, but not everyone knows what it celebrates. It is not, as some believe, Mexico's Independence Day. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cinco de Mayo, Mexican Independence Day, Sombrero, Fiesta coloring page|url=http://printables4kids.com/cinco-de-mayo-coloring-page/|accessdate=2010-09-16|quote=Get ready for the Fiesta! Print out our original coloring page for your Cinco de Mayo (also known as Mexican Independence Day) celebration and color the Mexican flag, a sombrero, maracas, a pinata and more!}}&lt;/ref&gt;
''[[Cinco de mayo]]'' is not Mexico's "Independence Day", but rather commemorates an initial victory of Mexican forces over [[France|French]] forces in the [[Battle of Puebla]] on May 5, 1862.

In contrast to Independence Day, described above, ''Cinco de mayo'' is observed mostly at a local level (Puebla State) and is a minor Bank Holiday in the rest of Mexico. Many labor unions have negotiated to have the day off, however, since its proximity to Labor Day (May 1) often allows an extended five-day weekend or two consecutive three-day weekends.

The '''Five Pillars of Islam''' (''{{transl|ar|DIN|arkān al-Islām}}'' {{lang|ar|أركان الإسلام}}; also ''{{transl|ar|DIN|arkān al-dīn}}'' {{lang|ar|أركان الدين}} "pillars of the [[ad-Din|religion]]") are five basic acts in [[Islam]], considered [[fard|mandatory]] by believers and are the foundation of [[Muslim]] life. They are summarized in the famous [[hadith of Gabriel]].&lt;ref name="Britannica"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/295625/Pillars-of-Islam |title=Pillars of Islam |publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] Online|accessdate=2007-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Oxford"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t125/e1859 |title=Pillars of Islam |work=[[Oxford Centre for Islamic Studies]]|publisher=[[Oxford University]] |location=United Kingdom |accessdate=2010-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PBS"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/empires/islam/faithpillars.html |title=Five Pillars |publisher=[[Public Broadcasting Service]] (PBS) |location=United Kingdom |accessdate=2010-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="U-Calgary"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://people.ucalgary.ca/~elsegal/I_Transp/IO5_FivePillars.html |title=The Five Pillars of Islam |publisher=[[University of Calgary]] |location=Canada |accessdate=2010-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shahada: Faith===
''[[Shahada]]'' is a [[declaration of faith]] and trust that professes that there is only one [[God in Islam|God]] ''([[Allah]])'' and that [[Muhammad]] is God's messenger.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.co.uk/article/opr/t125/e1859?_hi=32&amp;_pos=3 From the article on the Pillars of Islam in Oxford Islamic Studies Online]{{dead link|date=July 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a set statement normally recited in Arabic: ''lā ʾilāha ʾillā-llāhu muḥammadun rasūlu-llāh'' ({{lang|ar|لَا إِلٰهَ إِلَّا الله مُحَمَّدٌ رَسُولُ الله}})  "There is no god but God (and) Muhammad is the messenger of God."  It is essential to utter it to become a Muslim and to convert to Islam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=vHG_VulBdd4C&amp;pg=PA87&amp;dq=convert+islam+shahada#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Matthew S.

===Salah: Prayer===
[[File:Muslim men praying in Afghanistan-2010.jpg|thumb|[[Politics of Afghanistan|Afghan politicians]] and foreign diplomats praying (making salah) at the [[Embassy of the United States, Kabul|U.S. Embassy in Kabul]], [[Afghanistan]].]]

''[[Salah]]'' (''ṣalāh'') is the Islamic [[prayer]]. ''Salah'' consists of five daily prayers according to the Sunna; the names are according to the prayer times: ''[[Fajr]]'' (dawn), ''[[Dhuhr]]'' (noon), ''[[Asr|ʿAṣr]]'' (afternoon), ''[[Maghrib]]'' (evening), and ''[[Isha'|ʿIshāʾ]]'' (night). The Fajr prayer is performed before sunrise, Dhuhr is performed in the midday after the sun has surpassed its highest point, Asr is the evening prayer before sunset, Maghrib is the evening prayer after sunset and Isha is the night prayer. All of these prayers are recited while facing in the direction of the [[Kaaba]] in [[Mecca]] and form an important aspect of the Muslim Ummah. Muslims must wash before prayer; this washing is called ''[[wudu]]'' ("purification"). The prayer is accompanied by a series of set positions including; bowing with hands on knees, standing, prostrating and sitting in a special position (not on the heels, nor on the buttocks). A [[Muslim]] may perform their prayer anywhere, such as in offices, universities, and fields. However, the [[mosque]] is the more preferable place for prayers because the mosque allows for fellowship.

===Zakāt: Charity===
''[[Zakāt]]'' or [[alms|alms-giving]] is the practice of charitable giving based on accumulated wealth. The word zakāt can be defined as purification and growth because it allows an individual to achieve balance and encourages new growth. The principle of knowing that all things belong to God is essential to purification and growth. Zakāt is obligatory for all Muslims who are able to do so. It is the personal responsibility of each Muslim to ease the economic hardship of others and to strive towards eliminating inequality.&lt;ref&gt;Ridgeon (2003), p.258&lt;/ref&gt; Zakāt consists of spending a portion of one's wealth for the benefit of the poor or needy, like debtors or travelers. A Muslim may also donate more as an act of voluntary charity (''[[sadaqah]]''), rather than to achieve additional divine reward.&lt;ref&gt;Zakat, ''Encyclopaedia of Islam Online''&lt;/ref&gt;

There are five principles that should be followed when giving the zakāt:
# The giver must declare to God his intention to give the zakāt.
# The zakāt must be paid on the day that it is due.
# After the offering, the payer must not exaggerate on spending his money more than usual means.
# Payment must be in kind. This means if one is wealthy then he or she needs to pay a portion of their income. If a person does not have much money, then they should compensate for it in different ways, such as good deeds and good behavior toward others.
# The zakāt must be distributed in the community from which it was taken.&lt;ref&gt;[http://public.wsu.edu/~dee/GLOSSARY/ZAKAT.HTM Zakat Alms-giving]{{Dead link|date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;'''

===Sawm: Fasting===
[[File:Date-seller.jpg|thumb|[[Muslim]]s traditionally break their fasts in the [[Ramadan (calendar month)|month of Ramadan]] with [[Date palm#Fruit|dates]] (like those offered by this date seller in [[Kuwait City]]), as was the recorded practice ([[Sunnah]]) of [[Muhammad]].]]
Three types of [[fasting]] (''[[Siyam]]'') are recognized by the Quran: Ritual fasting,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|2|183|end=187|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; fasting as compensation for repentance (both from [[sura]] [[Al-Baqara]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|2|196|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ascetic fasting (from [[Al-Ahzab]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|33|35|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fasting, ''Encyclopedia of the Qur'an'' (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

Ritual fasting is an obligatory act during the month of [[Ramadan]].&lt;ref name="Caesar_1"&gt;Farah (1994), p.144-145&lt;/ref&gt; Muslims must abstain from food and drink from dawn to dusk during this month, and are to be especially mindful of other sins.&lt;ref name="Caesar_1"/&gt; Fasting is necessary for every Muslim that has reached puberty (unless he/she suffers from a medical condition which prevents him/her from doing so).&lt;ref&gt;talhaanjum_9&lt;/ref&gt;

The fast is meant to allow Muslims to seek nearness and to look for forgiveness from God, to express their gratitude to and dependence on him, atone for their past sins, and to remind them of the needy.&lt;ref&gt;Esposito (1998), p.90,91&lt;/ref&gt; During Ramadan, Muslims are also expected to put more effort into following the teachings of Islam by refraining from violence, anger, envy, greed, lust, profane language, gossip and to try to get along with fellow Muslims better. In addition, all obscene and irreligious sights and sounds are to be avoided.&lt;ref&gt;Tabatabaei (2002), p. 211,213&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Fasting during Ramadan]] is obligatory, but is forbidden for several groups for whom it would be very dangerous and excessively problematic. These include pre-pubescent children, those with a medical condition such as [[Diabetes mellitus|diabetes]], [[Old age|elderly people]], and [[pregnancy|pregnant]] or [[breastfeeding]] women. Observing fasts is not permitted for menstruating women. Other individuals for whom it is considered acceptable not to fast are those who are ill or traveling. Missing fasts usually must be made up for soon afterward, although the exact requirements vary according to circumstance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/fundamentals/pillars/fasting/tajuddin/fast_21.html#HEADING20 |title=For whom fasting is mandatory |publisher=USC-MSA Compendium of Muslim Texts |accessdate=2007-04-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070308025221/http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/fundamentals/pillars/fasting/tajuddin/fast_21.html |archivedate=8 March 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|2|184|style=ref}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Khan (2006), p. 54&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Islam, ''The New Encyclopædia Britannica'' (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hajj: pilgrimage to Mecca===
The ''[[Hajj]]'' is a [[pilgrimage]] that occurs during the [[Islamic calendar|Islamic month]] of [[Dhu al-Hijjah]] to the holy city of [[Mecca]]. Every able-bodied Muslim is obliged to make the pilgrimage to Mecca at least once in their life.&lt;ref name="Caesar_2"&gt;Farah (1994), p.145-147&lt;/ref&gt; When the pilgrim is around {{convert|10|km|abbr=on}} from Mecca, he/she must dress in [[Ihram clothing]], which, for men, consists of two white sheets. Both men and women are required to make the pilgrimage to Mecca. After a Muslim makes the trip to Mecca, he/she is known as a [[Hajji|hajj/hajja]] (one who made the pilgrimage to Mecca).&lt;ref name="Britannica_India"&gt;Hoiberg (2000), p.237–238&lt;/ref&gt; The main rituals of the Hajj include walking seven times around the Kaaba termed ''[[Tawaf]]'', touching the [[Black Stone]] termed Istilam, traveling seven times between [[Al-Safa and Al-Marwah|Mount Safa and Mount Marwah]] termed ''[[Sa'yee]]'', and symbolically [[Stoning of the Devil|stoning the Devil]] in [[Mina, Saudi Arabia|Mina]] termed Ramee.&lt;ref name="Britannica_India"/&gt;

The [[pilgrim]], or the ''haji'', is honoured in the Muslim community. Islamic teachers say that the Hajj should be an expression of devotion to God, not a means to gain social standing. The believer should be self-aware and examine their intentions in performing the pilgrimage. This should lead to constant striving for self-improvement.&lt;ref&gt;Goldschmidt (2005), p.48&lt;/ref&gt; A pilgrimage made at any time other than the Hajj season is called an ''[[Umrah]]'', and while not mandatory is strongly recommended. Also, they make a pilgrimage to the holy city of [[Jerusalem]] in their alms-giving feast.

==Pillars of Shia Islam==

=== Twelvers ===
Twelver Shia Islam has five Usul al-Din and ten Furu al-Din, i.e., the [[Shia Islamic beliefs and practices]]. The Twelver Shia Islam Usul al-Din, equivalent to a Shia Five Pillars, are all beliefs considered foundational to Islam, and thus classified a bit differently from those listed above.&lt;ref&gt;See chapter on "Islamic Beliefs (the Pillars of Islam)" in Invitation to Islam by [[Sayed Moustafa Al-Qazwini]]. http://www.al-islam.org/invitation/&lt;/ref&gt; They are:

# ''[[Tawhid]]'' (monotheism: belief in the oneness of God)
# ''[[Adl]]'' (divine justice: belief in God's justice)
# ''[[Nubuwwah]]'' (prophethood)
# ''[[Imamah (Shia) |Imamah]]'' (succession to Muhammad)
# ''[[Mi'ad]]'' (the day of judgment and the resurrection)

In addition to these five pillars, there are ten practices that Shia Muslims must perform, called the ''[[Ancillaries of the Faith]]''&lt;ref&gt;Walsh, John Evangelist. ''Walking shadows: Orson Welles, William Randolph Hearst, and Citizen Kane''. Madison, Wisconsin: University of Wisconsin Press/Popular Press, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; (Arabic: '''furūʿ al-dīn''').

# [[Salah]]
# [[Sawm]]
# [[Zakat]], similar to Sunni Islam, it applies to money, cattle, silver, gold, dates, raisins, wheat, and barley.
# [[Khums]]: an annual taxation of one-fifth (20%) of the gains that a year has been passed on without using. Khums is paid to the [[Imamah (Twelver doctrine)|Imams]]; indirectly to poor and needy people.
# [[Hajj]]
# [[Jihad]]
# [[Enjoining good and forbidding wrong|Enjoining good]]
# [[Enjoining good and forbidding wrong|Forbidding wrong]]
# [[Tawalla]]: expressing love towards good.
# [[Tabarra]]: expressing disassociation and hatred towards evil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rahyafte.com/en/2023/fundamental-beliefs-muslims/ |title=The Fundamental Beliefs of Muslims |publisher=Comprehensive Database Mstbsryn, missionaries and Rhyaftgan |language=English |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ismailis ===
{{main|Seven pillars of Ismailism}}
[[Isma'ilism|Isma'ilis]] have their own pillars, which are as follows:
* [[Walayah]] "Guardianship" denotes love and devotion to God, the prophets, and the [[Imamah (Ismaili doctrine)|Ismaili Imams]] and their representatives
* [[Tawhid]], "Oneness of God".
* Salah: Unlike Sunni and Twelver Muslims, [[Nizari]] Ismailis reason that it is up to the current imām to designate the style and form of prayer.
* Zakat: with the exception of the [[Druze]], all Ismaili [[madhhab]]s have practices resembling that of Sunni and Twelvers, with the addition of the characteristic Shia khums.
* Sawm: Nizaris and [[Musta'li]]s believe in both a metaphorical and literal meaning of fasting.
* Hajj: For Ismailis, this means visiting the imām or his representative and that this is the greatest and most spiritual of all pilgrimages. The Mustaali maintain also the practice of going to Mecca. The Druze interpret this completely metaphorically as "fleeing from devils and oppressors" and rarely go to Mecca.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://lexicorient.com/e.o/ismailis.htm | title = Isma'ilism | accessdate=2007-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Jihad "Struggle": "the Greater Struggle" and "the Lesser Struggle".

In music, a '''''Flute method''''' is a kind of specific [[textbook]] style manual for playing the [[Western concert flute|flute]]. It usually contains [[Fingering (music)|fingering]] charts and/or [[musical scale|scales]] and numerous different [[exercise]]s, sometimes also simple [[etude]]s, in different [[key (music)|key]]s, in ascending order as to difficulty (= in methodical ''progression'') or with a focus on isolated aspects like fluency, [[rhythm]], [[dynamics (music)|dynamics]], [[articulation (music)|articulation]] and the like. Sometimes there are duets or even [[recital]] pieces, also with accompaniment. Such methods differ from etude books in that they are meant as a linear course for a student to follow, with consistent guidance, whereas volumes of etudes are not as comprehensive.

As typical instrumental methods are meant to function as textbooks supporting an instrumental teacher (rather than to facilitate self-teaching), usually no basic or special playing techniques are covered in any depth. Detailed instructions in this respect are only found in special, [[Autodidacticism|autodidactical]] methods.

Some methods are specially tailored for students on certain [[skill]] levels or [[Erikson's stages of psychosocial development|stages of psychosocial development]]. In contrast, a 'complete' method (sometimes in multiple volumes) is meant to accompany the student until he or she becomes an advanced player.

Methods of certain authors or editors have achieved the status of standard works (reflecting regional and cultural differences) and are published or reissued by different [[publishing]] companies and often in new layouts or [[arrangement]]s. The [[Suzuki Method]] is one of the most well known examples of this.

A '''guard of honour''' ([[British English|en-GB]]), '''guard of honor''' ([[American English|en-US]]), also '''honour guard''' ([[British English|en-GB]]), '''honor guard''' ([[American English|en-US]]), also '''ceremonial guard''', is a guard, usually military in nature, appointed to receive or guard a head of state or other dignitary, the fallen in war, or to attend at state ceremonials, especially funerals. In military weddings, especially those of commissioned officers, a guard, composed usually of service members of the same branch, form the [[Saber arch]]. In principle any military unit could act as a guard of honour. However, in some countries certain units are specially designated for guard of honour duty.

Guards of Honour also serve in the civilian world for fallen police officers and other civil servants. Certain religious bodies, especially Churches of the Anglican Communion and the Methodist movement, have the tradition of an Honour Guard at the funeral of an ordained elder, in which all other ordained elders present "guard the line" between the door of the church and the grave, or [[hearse]] if the deceased is to be buried elsewhere or cremated.&lt;ref&gt;Traditions of the United Methodist Church&lt;/ref&gt; The practice of providing a guard of honour as a mark of respect also occurs in sports, especially throughout the [[Commonwealth of Nations]].

===Africa===
====Algeria====
[[File:Secretary Clinton Prepares To Meet With Algerian President Bouteflika (8141535559).jpg|thumb|The [[Algerian Republican Guard]] welcome the [[U.S. Secretary of State]] [[Hillary Clinton]]. The Guard is a ceremonial corps of the [[Algerian Army]].]]
The [[Algerian Republican Guard]] ([[Arabic language|Arabic]]: الحرس الجمهوري الجزائري, [[French language|French]]: Garde républicaine algérienne), is a mainly ceremonial military corps of the [[Algerian Army]] which is composed of 6,000 troops. It is very similar to the French Army in its formation style. The Republican Guard includes a horse mounted cavalry unit and a musicak fanfare [[military band]], with the cavalry detachment basing it's uniform and traditions in the roots of the military traditions of the famous [[Berber people|Berber]] cavalry, the [[Numidian cavalry]], the French cavalry, and the [[Arab]] cavalry.

====Egypt====
The [[Egyptian Republican Guard]] is a division level unit in the [[Egyptian Army]] which is the seniormost unit in the [[Egyptian Armed Forces]] that has the responsibility of defending the President of Egypt, as well as major presidential and national institutions. It is a type of [[Praetorian Guard]] that is composed of dozens upon dozens of armored brigades, mechanized brigades and divisional artillery, Being the seniormost unit in the armed forces, the Republican Guard Division is the only major military unit allowed in central [[Cairo]] besides the troops of intelligence services and [[Central Security Forces]].

====Nigeria====
The members of the [[Presidential Guard Brigade (Nigeria)|Nigerian Presidential Guard Brigade]] are elite Nigerian soldiers which guards the residence of the President of the Federal Republic and his guests as well as perform ceremonial duties.

====Senegal====
[[File:Obama inspecting the Red Guard 01.jpg|thumb|left|[[Barack Obama]] inspecting the [[Red Guard of Senegal]]. The Guard's uniform is derived from the [[Spahi]].]]
The [[Red Guard of Senegal]] is a Senegalese Gendarmerie unit that is responsible for maintaining the security of the [[President of Senegal]]. It is similar to the ceremonial elements in the [[French Republican Guard]]. The unit's uniform is derived from the French colonial [[Spahi]]. The Red Guard is under the direct command of the Security Legion of the Senegalese [[Mobile Gendarmerie]]. It is composed of many units that serve ceremonial duties, with the most notable being the honour guard battalion and the mounted squadron.

====South Africa====
The guard of honour unit in [[South Africa]] was the [[State Presidents Guard]] (Staatspresidentseenheid) until 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=State President's Unit|url=http://www.sadf.info/TitleNationalColours.html|publisher=[[South African National Defence Force]]|date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The unit has since been replaced by the [[National Ceremonial Guard]] in the [[South African National Defence Force]]. Permanent honour guards in the country had not existed prior to the Staatspresidentseenheid's founding in 1967. Following the abolition of apartheid in South Africa, the guard was disestablished, leaving the defense forces without an official guard of honour until 1995, when the NCG was founded.

===Americas===
====Argentina====
[[File:Mauricio Macri &amp; Obama on the Pink House.jpg|thumb|The [[Argentine Army]]'s [[Regiment of Mounted Grenadiers]] serve as the country's ceremonial guards.]]
The [[Regiment of Mounted Grenadiers]] serves as a part of the [[Argentine Army]], serving as the presidential guard and ceremonial companions. Two unmounted grenadiers are stationed in front of [[Casa Rosada|the Pink House]] as a symbol of the ceremonial and honour guard.

====Brazil====
The Brazilian armed forces and [[Military Police (Brazil)|police]] have several troops for ceremonial usages. The most important of them is the [[president of Brazil|Brazilian president's]] honour guard. It is composed of the 1st Guards Cavalry Regiment (1o Regimento de Cavalaria de Guardas – RCG, in Portuguese) – "[[Dragoon#Brazil|Independence Dragoons]]", the [[Presidential Guard Battalion (Brazil)|Presidential Guard Battalion]] (Batalhão da Guarda Presidencial – BGP, in Portuguese) and the [[Cayenne Battery]].

====Canada====
[[File:Sergio Mattarella al Rideau Hall 08.jpg|thumb|The [[Governor General's Foot Guards]] is one of two [[Foot Guards]] regiments in the [[Canadian Army]].]]
The [[Canada|Canadian]] guard of honour is formed from members of the [[Ceremonial Guard]], an ''ad hoc'' unit drawn from all branches of the [[Canadian Forces]] (CF). Although the unit's members are derived from a variety of military units, the Ceremonial Guard uses similar uniforms to Canada's two [[Foot Guards]] regiments as a reflection of their traditional connection with those regiments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.gc.ca/web/article-en.do?mthd=index&amp;crtr.page=2&amp;nid=1090439|title=The Canadian Armed Forces Ceremonial Guard|date=24 June 2016|publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada|accessdate=28 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The unit comprises 400 people, including a Foot Guard company and the Band of the Ceremonial Guard. The Ceremonial Guard typically execute public duties in [[Ottawa]] during the summer months of the year. The Guard is mounted on dates such as [[Canada Day]] and [[Remembrance Day#Canada|Remembrance Day]], inspected by the most senior dignitary in attendance. They may also be formed for repatriation ceremonies for fallen soldiers returning from combat. Public duties in Ottawa were performed by the [[The Canadian Guards|Canadian Guards]] before the unit's disbandment in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.army-armee.forces.gc.ca/en/ceremonial-guard/about.page|title=About the Ceremonial Guard|year=2017|publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada|accessdate=28 May 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140916233349/http://www.army-armee.forces.gc.ca/en/ceremonial-guard/about.page|archivedate=16 September 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to 2007, membership with the Ceremonial Guard was restricted to the Foot Guards of the Canadian Army. The [[Household Division]] of the [[Canadian Army]] had traditionally performed ceremonial duties, such as guard mounting or Trooping the Colour. The Household Division consists of two regiments of [[Foot Guards]] (the [[The Canadian Grenadier Guards|Canadian Grenadier Guards]] and the [[Governor General's Foot Guards]]) as well as one cavalry regiment (the [[The Governor General's Horse Guards|Governor General's Horse Guards]]). Several other Canadian Army regimental units have also performed guard of honour duties, including the [[Royal 22nd Regiment]], these units are active in events such as royal and state visits, national and provincial celebrations, state, military and civil funerals and ceremonies related to the work of the entire Armed Forces. Alongside these are detachments made up for ceremonial duties from both the [[Royal Canadian Navy]] and the [[Royal Canadian Air Force]].

====Colombia====
The [[37th Infantry Presidential Guard Battalion]], composed of five companies, a historical company and one [[artillery battery]] plus a [[military band]], a fanfare trumpet section and [[Corps of Drums]], is the [[President of Colombia]]'s honour guard service regiment under the [[National Army of Colombia]]. It is stationed at the [[Casa de Nariño]] in [[Bogota]] where it The changing of the guard ceremony takes place three days per week and carries the traditions of Simon Bolivar's infantry guards company raised in the midst of the [[Spanish American wars of independence]] in 1815.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ejercito.mil.co/?idcategoria=277533|title=Batallón de Infantería No. 37 Guardia Presidencial - DIV05|first=Micrositios Content|last=Manager|website=Ejército Nacional de Colombia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cuba====
[[File:Fidel Castro11.jpeg|thumb|[[Fidel Castro]] and [[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva]] inspect honour guards from the [[Ceremonial Unit of the Cuban Revolutionary Armed Forces]].]]
The [[Ceremonial Unit of the Cuban Revolutionary Armed Forces]] provided honours for the [[Communist Party of Cuba]], the [[Government of Cuba]], and the [[Cuban Revolutionary Armed Forces]]. It is a sort of mix between Russian and German ceremonial formations, with the unit notably adopting the Germa  [[goosestep]]. It's ceremonial duties are usuay performed at government buildings and notable areas in [[Havana]], with the [[Plaza de la Revolución]] (the main square in the capital) and the [[Palace of the Revolution]] (the workplace of the [[President of Cuba]]). The main purpose of the military unit is the performance of the changing of the guard every half an hour at the José Marti Mausoleum in [[Santiago de Cuba]]. Prior to [[Fidel Castro]]'s [[1959 Cuban Revolution]], honour guards were performed by units that resembled honour guard units in the [[United States]], such as [[3rd U.S. Infantry Regiment (The Old Guard)|The Old Guard]].

====Haiti====
Haitian honour guard duties are performed by the General Security Unit of the National Palace of the [[Haitian National Police]] (L'Unité de Sécurité Générale du Palais National, USGPN) which is a major specialized unit of the PNH. It has, since 1997, mainly ensured security at the [[National Palace (Haiti)|Palais National]] and the security of the [[President of Haiti]]. The USGPN works with the Presidential Security Unit (Unité de sécurité présidentielle, USP) to protect the president, as well as intervene when a crime takes place and or assist police officers in their duties, outside of the USGPN's ceremonial ones. Funeral honors, state visits, and military parades are some of the many ceremonies that the USGPN takes in.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.refworld.org/docid/4a7040ae23.html&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mexico====
[[File:Visita Oficial del Primer Ministro de Canadá, Justin Trudeau (36991997323).jpg|thumb|Mexican honour guards during [[Justin Trudeau]]'s [[state visit]] to Mexico.]]
The Honour Guard in [[Mexico]] consists of members selected from the Navy, Army or Air Force, and report to the Secretariats of National Defense and the Navy, while the [[Estado Mayor Presidencial]] maintains, through the Army Presidential Guards Corps, a dedicated guards brigade.

A guard of honour is formed to present formal ceremonial compliments to royal or presidential dignitaries by a guard not exceeding 100 personnel (including three officers, one with a colour) with other particular distinguished individuals saluted by a guard not exceeding 50 personnel. A ''half guard'' is a colloquial term describing a guard of honour of not more than 50 personnel (including two officers, one with a colour).&lt;ref&gt;''RAF Drill and Ceremonial'' AP 818
7th Edition&lt;/ref&gt; A guard of honour could have a single service contingent (e.g. army) or it could be a tri service (inter-service) affair. The guard commander, after saluting the dignitary (usually head of state), marches up to him or her and escorts him or her to inspect the guard (soldiers in formation). During the salute, the national anthems of both the dignitary's country and the host country are usually played by a ceremonial band.
[[File:Donald Trump with Queen Elizabeth.jpg|thumb|left|Units from the British Household Division typically perform ceremonial duties, such as mounting a guard of honour.]]
Only a [[War flag|standard]], [[Guidon (heraldic flag)|guidon]], Queen's Colour, or a [[banner]] presented by either a member of the Royal Family or the governor-general may be carried by a royal guard of honour. Only a regimental colour or a banner presented by a personage other than a member of the Royal Family may be carried on a half guard of honour. A smaller unit honouring distinguished visitors at a military installation is known as a ''quarter guard''. The commander is three paces in front of the second file from the right and accompanies the personage for whom the guard is mounted. An officer carrying the Colour stands three paces in front of the centre; if there is a third officer he will be three paces in front of the second file from the other flank.&lt;ref&gt;p.128 ''Guards of honour'' from ''Ceremonial 1912''&lt;/ref&gt;

The same has occasionally been done for individual players meeting particularly momentous points in their career, such as when Scottish Premier league team [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] squad did so for departing talisman [[Dado Prso]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.thefreelibrary.com/Football%3A+TEARIO+DADO%3B+Prso+breaks+down+as+Gers+stars+give+him+an...-a0163320881 |title=Football: TEARIO DADO; Prso breaks down as Gers stars give him an emotional send-off. |work=[[Daily Record (Scotland)|Daily Record]] |date=14 May 2007 |accessdate=29 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] controversially&lt;ref name="Terry"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2017/may/22/john-terry-26-guard-of-honour-chelsea-stamford-bridge |title=John Terry’s 26th-minute guard of honour send-off at Chelsea: fair or farce? |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=22 May 2017 |accessdate=29 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; chose to do so in a pre-planned display in the middle of a match for [[John Terry]]'s last game, causing significant delays to the game.&lt;ref name="Terry"/&gt;

===Australian rules football===
In [[Australian rules football]], players will often form a guard of honour for those who are leaving the field after a landmark game or on their retirement game. For example, Fremantle formed a guard of honour for Fitzroy's last match in 1996. [[Melbourne F.C.|Melbourne]] and [[Essendon F.C.|Essendon]] formed a guard in 2005 to honour [[Indian Ocean tsunami]] victim [[Troy Broadbridge]]. [[Collingwood Football Club|Collingwood]] and [[North Melbourne Football Club|North Melbourne]] formed a guard of honour in 2006 for retiring player [[Saverio Rocca]], who forged a successful goalkicking career at both clubs.  After playing in the [[little league (Australian rules football)|little league]] at half time of senior matches, the junior players line up to form a guard of honour for when the players return to the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://open.abc.net.au/posts/our-sideline-snub-64rk7hp|title=Port Power missed our guard of honour|first= Emma |last=Pedler |date=30 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cricket===
[[File:Muralitharan gaurdofhonour harare IMG.JPG|thumb|[[Muttiah Muralitharan]] receives a guard of honour from his teammates, after breaking [[Courtney Walsh]]'s record for the most [[Test cricket|Test match]] wickets.]]
In [[cricket]], the guard of honour is used to celebrate the achievement of a player (usually as a [[batsman]]), normally used during a player's final game. The players' teammates or opposition form a cordon, with their bats at the second count of the draw saber forming an arch, and the successful player walks through. It may also be performed to mark a milestone, such as when a player breaks a world record. A player can receive guard of honour multiple times as they retire from different forms of the game separately. When a bowler retires, it would generally be when they leave the field for the final time, or when they play their final match in a certain venue of importance (away match, home ground, retiring on the same day a ground is due to be demolished).

===Field Hockey===
In recent times guard of honour is usually done among Hockey players for those who have done something valuable for their country like [[Balbir Singh, Sr]], [[Jamie Dwyer]]

A '''hanok''' ({{Lang-ko|한옥}}) is a traditional [[Korea|Korean]] house. Hanoks were first designed and built in the 14th century during the [[Joseon|Joseon Dynasty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x2JzBgAAQBAJ|title=Hanok: The Korean House|last=Park|first=Nani|last2=Fouser|first2=Robert J.|publisher=Tuttle Publishing|year=2015|isbn=1462915140|location=|pages=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Korean architecture]] considers the positioning of the house in relation to its surroundings, with thought given to the land and seasons. The interior of the house is also planned accordingly. This principle is called ''baesanimsu'' ([[Hangul|Hangu]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;l: 배산임수; [[Hanja]]: 背山臨水), meaning that the ideal house is built with a mountain in the back and a river in the front. Hanok shapes differ by region. In the cold northern regions of Korea, hanoks are built in a square with a courtyard in the middle in order to retain heat better. In the south, hanoks are more open and L-shaped.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fG3oBAAAQBAJ|title=Geek in Korea: Discovering Asia's New Kingdom of Cool|last=Tudor|first=Daniel|publisher=Tuttle Publishing|year=2014|isbn=1462914071|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Danwon-Giwa.igi.jpg|thumb|''Giwa'' (기와) drawn by [[Danwon]]]]
A hanok is a Korean house  which was developed in [[Korean Peninsula]] and [[Manchuria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mignon|first=Olivier|title=세계의 모든 집 이야기|trans-title=Story of House|year=2008|isbn=9788996029984}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Early Time'''
 
[[Paleolithic]] people in the Korean Peninsula stayed in caves or made temporary houses. In the [[Neolithic]] era, the temporary house developed into a [[dugout hut]]. They dug into the ground with a small shovel and built a small house which used [[rafter]]s and [[column]]s. Woods was used for the rafters and columns, and straw was used for roof. In the [[Bronze Age]], there were several columns in the house, so the area of house was extended relative to early houses. [[Iron Age]] ''Hanok''([[Hangul]]: 한옥) had [[Ondol]]([[Hangul]]: 온돌). The house also used ''Giwa''([[Hangul]]: 기와), a kind of roofing tile which was made with baked soil. By using ''[[Giwa]]'' roof tiles, ''hanok'' developed a specific shape.
 	
'''The Enlightenment'''

The Enlightenment saw many foreigners visit the hermit kingdom. For this reason, [[Christianity]] was spread, but it wasn't common. [[Anglicanism]] and [[Catholicism]] were particularly more common. Thus, early Churches utilized the ''hanok'' style. This church is located in [[Ganghwa County]], [[Jincheon County]], [[Cheongju]]. 
 
'''South Korea'''

[[File:Korea Jeongseon Traditional Market Train 27 (14202263057).jpg|thumb|Interior of a traditional house at [[Jeongseon County]], Gangwon Province.]]
From the 1970s, the old architects learned today's architecture, they aware hanok as an old day's antiquated and inefficient architecture and demolished a lot of hanoks of historical value have been disappeared. In big cities of South Korea, only small clusters of hanoks remain. However, the value of hanok has been highlighted from the 2000s the efficiency of hanok's eco-friendly function and healing effectiveness has been emphasized. Today, the number of people who try to move into hanok is growing rapidly to cure  diseases such as atopy and asthma which are mainly caused by environment.  Recently, many other places try to follow the designs like hanok's gentility such as in public places;bathroom, signs and even private places;cafe.
Today, some train stations are built in hanok design. ([[Jeonju]] station is famous)


'''North Korea'''

In Gaesung, the traditional hanoks originally there remain and play a role as a tourist attraction. Kiwajibs are surrounding the hanoks.
 
'''China'''

In northeast China, hanoks also can be found and Koreans are living in hanoks building for themselves over 100 years. Also, from 2010, people are working on a project focused on making a hanok village in [[Heilongjiang]], China{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}.

==Term==
[[File:Interior of a traditional Korean house.JPG|thumb|Interior of a traditional house at the [[National Folk Museum of Korea]]]]
According to old paper about house in April 23 of 1907, the terms that '''Hanok''' appeared on the history for the first time. In that paper, Hanok was figure out the specific region where [[Jeong-dong]]road, from [[Donuimun]] to Baejae school. At that time, instead of using Hanok, terms like 'Jooga'(It means living houses), 'Jaetaek'(It means all kinds of house) were used widespread. So 'Hanok' was only used special circumstance when latest house was built in somewhere. 

When era of [[Korea under Japanese rule]], the ruler used terms such as 'Jooga' or 'Joseon House' when they were talking about [[house improvement]]. There was a record about hanok, however the specific terms of hanok, hasn't used prevalently.  

The specific word, Hanok, appeared on [[Samsung]] Korean big dictionary in 1975, it defined as antonym of [[western house]] and of [[Joseon]] house, house of Korean style. After the 1970s, with urban development lots of [[Apartment]], [[Row House]] was built in South Korea, a big number of Hanoks deappeared in every town. From that time, hanok was only called Korean traditional house.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=한옥용어의 등장|url=http://blog.naver.com/city_style/60065290111|publisher=Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A broad sense of hanok refer [[Thatching]], Neowa-jib(a shingle-roofed house), Giwa-jib(tile-roofed house) though, general meaning of hanok means only Giwa-jib(tile-roofed house) in Korea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=이|first=상현|title=즐거운 한옥 읽기, 즐거운 한옥 짓기|year=2007|publisher=그물코|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
[[File:순천 송광사 하사당 01.jpg|thumb|Hasadang Hall located in [[Suncheon]], [[South Jeolla Province]] was built in 1461.]]
The environment-friendly aspects of traditional Korean houses range from the structure's inner layout to the building materials which were used. Another unique feature of traditional houses is their special design for cooling the interior in  summer and heating the interior in winter.

Since Korea has hot summers and cold winters, the '[[Ondol]] (Gudeul),' a floor-based heating system,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ondol (Under-floor Heating System)|url=http://english.visitkorea.or.kr/enu/AC/AC_EN_4_5_2_5.jsp|publisher=Korea Tourism Organization|accessdate=17 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 'Daecheong,' a cool wooden-floor style hall were devised long ago to help Koreans survive the frigid winters and to block sunlight during summer. These primitive types of heating and air-conditioning were so effective that they are still in use in many homes today. The posts, or  'Daedulbo' are not inserted into the ground, but are fitted into the cornerstones to keep Hanok safe from earthquakes.

==Materials==
[[File:KOCIS Hanok (6387715325).jpg|thumb|Hanoks in [[Seoul]]]]
The raw materials used in Hanok, such as soil, timber, and rock, are all natural and recyclable and do not cause pollution. Hanok's have their own tiled roofs (Giwa; [[Hangul]]: 기와), wooden beams and stone-block construction. Cheoma is the edge of Hanok's curvy roofs. The lengths of the Cheoma can be adjusted to control the amount of sunlight that enters the house. Hanji (Korean traditional paper, [[Hangul]]: 한지) is lubricated with bean oil making it waterproof and polished. Windows and doors made with Hanji are beautiful and breathable.

[[File:Sarangbang_British_Museum_room_67_n02.jpg|thumb|[[Sarangbang]]]]

==Regional differences==
[[File:Inside a Hanok.JPG|thumb|A Numaru is a traditional Korean balcony-like raised veranda. It is often distinguished from a larger living room by a plinth, a partial enclosure, and low-to-the-floor furniture.]]
The shapes of Hanok differ regionally. Due to the warmer weather in the southern region, Koreans built Hanok in a straight line, like the number 1. In order to allow good wind circulation, there are open wooden floored living area and many windows. The shape of the most popular Hanok in the central region is like letter "L" or Korean letter "ㄱ", an architectural mixture of the shapes in the northern and the southern regions. Hanoks in the cold northern region, are box-shaped like Korean letter "ㅁ" so that it would be able to block the wind flow in building Hanoks. They do not have an open wooden floored area but the rooms are all joined together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Layout of a Hanok|url=http://english.visitkorea.or.kr/enu/AC/AC_EN_4_5_2_2.jsp|publisher=Korean Tourism Organization|accessdate=17 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Differences according to social class==
The structure of Hanok is also classified according to social class. Typically the houses of [[yangban]] (upper class), [[Jungin]] (middle class) and urban commoners with ''giwa'' (tiled roof) emphasized not only the function of the house, but also possessed great aesthetic value. On the other hand, the houses of the provincial commoners (as well as some impoverished yangban) with ''choga'' (a roof plaited by rice straw) were built in a more strictly functional manner.

==Preservation==
Many hanoks have been preserved, such as:

[[Gahoe-dong]] and [[Gye-dong]] in [[Jongno-gu]], [[Seoul]], are home to many hanoks, that have been remodeled into cafes, restaurants and teahouses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bukchon streets lure folks with rustic charm and retro cool|url=http://koreajoongangdaily.joinsmsn.com/news/article/Article.aspx?aid=2932861|accessdate=27 January 2013|newspaper=Joongang Daily|date=2 March 2011|author=Yoo Sun-young|author2=Hannah Kim|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130216100143/http://koreajoongangdaily.joinsmsn.com/news/article/Article.aspx?aid=2932861|archivedate=16 February 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Myth related to Hanok==
Sungjosin, Samshinhalmi (one who gives birth to women), [[Kitchen God]] etc. believed by people that there are different kinds of gods related to the house of each enrollment. This belief is shared with the religion of the [[Ainu people|Ainu]].

A '''virtual learning environment''' (VLE) is a system that creates an environment designed to facilitate teachers' management of educational courses for their students, especially a system using computer hardware and software, which involves distance learning. In North America, a virtual learning environment is often referred to as a "[[learning management system]]" (LMS).

* Harvey White, a physics professor at [[U.C. Berkeley]], produced 163 high school physics lessons at Pittsburgh's PBS station [[WQED (TV)|WQED]] that were broadcast into public schools in the area. Each 30 minute lesson was also filmed and subsequently distributed to dozens of educational/public television stations. In the academic year 1957–1958, White's television physics course was used in many thousands of public school classrooms across the nation in which over 100,000 students were enrolled. This course already made evident two important characteristics of distance education that carry over to contemporary online instruction: enormous economies of scale and higher labor productivity of the classroom based teacher/tutor/facilitator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Saettler|first=L.

* [[PLATO (computer system)|PLATO (Programmed Logic for Automated Teaching Operations)]] system developed at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]] in a project led by Dr. Donald Bitzer. Some rights to PLATO, including the trademark, are now owned by Edmentum (formerly PLATO Learning), which delivers managed course content over the [[Internet]].  The PLATO system featured multiple roles, including ''students'', who could study assigned lessons and communicate with teachers through on-line notes, ''instructors'', who could examine student progress data, as well as communicate and take lessons themselves, and ''authors'', who could do all of the above, plus create new lessons.  There was also a fourth type of user, called a ''multiple'', which was used for demonstrations of the PLATO system.&lt;ref name=PLATO&gt;Fundamentals of PLATO Programming, Celia R.

===1965===
* A five-year study of the impact of the PLATO system is published.&lt;ref name=Bitzer /&gt; Here are some highlights: "The results of exploratory queuing studies show that the system could teach as many as a thousand students simultaneously, while still allowing each student to proceed through the material independently." The PLATO system had two different ways to teach – "tutorial logic" where the system presented facts and examples, and then asked questions on the materials presented, and "inquiry logic" where the student could request and organize appropriate information from the computer. The presentation of materials ("slide selector") was called an ''electronic book''. The store of information in the system was called an ''electronic blackboard''. PLATO had a sophisticated ''help system'', whereby different types of wrong answers resulted in the student being sent different help sequences. A rudimentary ''spell checker'' was included in the system. A ''comment page'' allowed the student to comment on the lessons at any time. An ''instructor page'' allowed the instructor to communicate with the student. A "perfect workbook" recorded student responses to questions, as well as kept a ''record of each button the student pushed'' and the time at which he or she pushed it. These records were stored on magnetic tape for later ''statistical analysis''.

* The Learning Research Group is formed at [[Xerox PARC]] in Palo Alto, California. It is led by [[Alan Kay]], who advanced the idea of a graphical user interface (GUI) by inventing icons for folders, menus, and overlapping windows. Kay and his group envisioned a computer for teaching and learning that they called the "[https://web.archive.org/web/20120205105015/http://www.smalltalk.org/downloads/papers/SmalltalkHistoryHOPL.pdf KiddiKomputer]", to be programmed using the [[Smalltalk]] language they had developed. While Kay could see many educational uses for this computer, he had four initial projects in mind: 1) Teaching thinking skills, 2) Teaching modeling through the simulation of systems, 3) Teaching interface skills, and 4) Tracking what children would do with the computer outside school hours, when left to their own devices. Second level projects for teaching children with a computer included 1) Computer evaluation, 2) Iconic programming, especially for children under 8.

* An integrated student information system at Trinity University in Texas maintained data on about 1,500 variables. These included all student academic and personal data, all faculty data that dealt with courses and teaching, all course data in regards to student, faculty and class meeting times and days, enrollments, buildings, and the college calendar and catalog. There was also "an interaction course management system".&lt;ref&gt;Yost, Michael (1973) Extracting Data from Integrated Student Information Systems. ERIC Document ED244563.&lt;/ref&gt;
* As a post-doc at [[Carnegie-Mellon University]], Jay Warner needed to teach undergraduate metallurgy students how to use new software that would calculate phase diagrams (graphical representations of metal states/phases as a function of composition and temperature) based on thermodynamic properties. He wrote a CAI (Computer-Assisted Instruction) module that, however crudely, used some of the principles discussed in this article. A frame, or paragraph of information, was presented, and the machine branched to different follow-up frames and questions depending on the response to the embedded questions. The whole thing was written in FORTRAN IV. It proved useful; students could then use the software without close attendance by the instructor. This work was in no way as dramatic as the other accomplishments of the day, however it does show that by this time CAL was not restricted to studies of learning methods.

* [[Prestel]], claimed by BT as "the world's first public viewdata service", was opened in London in September, running on a cluster of minicomputers. It had been conceived in the early 1970s by [[Samuel Fedida]] of the Post Office Research Laboratories at Dollis Hill, London. Similar developments were under way in France (Teletel) and Canada (Telidon). Only those active at the time will remember the sense of euphoria and opening of possibilities in what would now be called the e-business and e-learning worlds. (Sadly, the concept was premature, although in France it had most success.) A number of mainframe, minicomputer and even micro-computer based systems and services were later developed in educational circles of which perhaps the best known were OPTEL, Communitel, ECCTIS and NERIS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.bt.com/archives/history/19691980.htm| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20021215160137/http://www.bt.com/archives/history/19691980.htm | archivedate = 2002-12-15| title = Events in Telecommunications History| accessdate = 2006-08-14| author = British Telecommunications}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In Canada, groups including [[TVOntario]], [[Athabasca University]], the [[University of Victoria]], and the [[University of Waterloo]] participated in [http://www.ieee.ca/millennium/telidon/telidon_twoway.html Telidon] experiments during the late 70s and early 80s. [[Telidon]], an alphageometric videotex information system used set-top boxes with TV sets, or subsequently software decoders running on PCs (Apple II, MAC, and PC decoders were available) to display text and graphics. The intent was to demonstrate and develop educational applications for videotex and teletext systems. This [http://www.amtec.ca/cjlt/vol15no2.pdf work continued until 1983], when the Telidon coding structure became a North American standard – ANSI T500 – NAPLPS (North American Presentation Layer Protocol Syntax).
* The Athabasca University educational Telidon project used a Unix path structure which allowed the storage of information pages in the file system tree. This is now the universal storage method for pages on the internet. As described, the system had the ability to create separate user groups with different access privileges, and to implement "action scripts" to access system functions, including email and dynamic content generation. The AU system was described in Abell, R.A. "Implementation of a Telidon System Using UNIX File Structures" in Godfrey, D. and Chang, E. (eds) The Telidon Book, Reston Publishing Company, Reston, VA, 1981)

* Successmaker is a K–12 learning management system with an emphasis on reading, spelling and numeracy. According to the [https://web.archive.org/web/20080517032227/http://www.pearsondigital.com/successes/successmaker/southcolonie.cfm Pearson Digital Learning website], the South Colonie Central School District in Albany, New York "has been using SuccessMaker since 1980, and in 1997 the district upgraded the software to SuccessMaker version 5.5."
* The Open University begins a pilot trial of a viewdata (videotex) system OPTEL, on a [[DECSYSTEM-20|DEC-20]] mainframe. This had been conceived by Peter Zorkoczy even before the launch of the national Prestel system in 1979 and was locally specified and coded (in [[COBOL]]) by Peter Frogbrook (RIP) and Gyan Mathur. One of the main motivations was its applicability to online learning. It was available via dial-up from home, and later in the 1980s via telnet(!) on the [[X.25]] and internet networks. There were individual user codes and passwords, giving different access rights; the one generic access code was regularly attacked by [[Hacker (computer security)|hackers]] even in these far-off days, as URLs still on the web attest. The system is overviewed in [http://eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/search/recordDetails.jsp?accno=ED247893&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=Viewdata-Style+Delivery+Mechanisms+for+CAL&amp;_pageLabel=RecordDetails&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=kw"Viewdata-Style Delivery Mechanisms for CAL", CAL Research Group Technical Report No. 11.]

* The idea of ''managing teaching resources using a computer'' is described in a paper by J.M. Leclerc and S. Normand from the [[University of Montreal]]. Their system was programmed in [[BASIC]], and used a computer to track documents, human resources, structured activities, and places for training and observation. Evaluation activities were also available in the system.&lt;ref&gt;Leclerc, J.M. and Normand, S. (1980) A general management system for university teaching resources. In Swail, E. and Neal, G. (Eds.)

* TLM (The Learning Manager) was released in 1980 and included distinct roles for students, instructors, educational assistants, and administrators. The system could be accessed remotely by dial-up as a student or an instructor using a terminal emulator. The system had a sophisticated test bank capability and generated tests and practice activities based on a learning objective data structure. Instructors and students could communicate through the terminal. Instructors could lock out students or post messages. Originally called LMS (Learning Management System), TLM was used extensively at SAIT (Southern Alberta Institute of Technology) and Bow Valley College, both located in Calgary, Alberta, Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.w-win.com/learningmanagementsystems/history/ |title=The Learning Manager&amp;reg |publisher=W-win.com |accessdate=2008-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Field trials begin of the Cyclops whiteboard system in the East Midlands Region of the Open University and run for two years. The evaluation was funded by a grant from British Telecom and allowed the evaluation Director Tony Bates to employ Mike Sharples and David McConnell as research fellows. Audio-visual material for Cyclops was produced on the ''Cyclops Studio '', a multimedia editing system coded in UCSD Pascal by a software team led by Paul Bacsich and including Mark Woodman. Cyclops was later awarded a BCS prize for innovation and systems installed in Indonesia. There are only passing references now to Cyclops on the open Web (see under names cited) – the best source of specifications and chronology is the article "Cyclops:shared-screen teleconferencing" in ''The Role of Technology in Distance Education'', edited Tony Bates, Croom Helm, 1984.&lt;ref name=Bates&gt;Bates, Tony &amp; Helm, Croom, eds.

* Over this period the Open University was also developing its own viewdata (videotex) system, called OPTEL, for use in education. This had in fact started about the same time as Cyclops in yet another team at the OU. The project ran until about 1985 when it faded away, as did videotex generally across the world (except the Minitel in France). In addition to OPTEL, several other systems were implemented including VOS (Videotex Operating System) which allowed the display and manipulation of text files via videotex. VOS was further developed into a telesoftware, transactional (gateway) and email system and then used in a commercial development for IMS, the media research company (using a very early precursor of Web/CGI development). These were coded in Pascal and COBOL on the [[DECSYSTEM-20|DEC-20]] mainframe. Some of the ideas of OPTEL were taken over into the ECCTIS project delivering course data via viewdata from a Unisys mainframe – indeed one of the former OPTEL staff joined ECCTIS as Director. Systems were also specified to deliver Computer-Assisted Learning – see in particular the article "Viewdata systems" in ''The Role of Technology in Distance Education''.&lt;ref name=Bates /&gt; There are only fragmentary references now to OPTEL on the open Web.

* Peter Smith of the UK Open University completes his PhD thesis (157 pp) on "Radiotext: an application of computer and communication systems in distance teaching". (Only [http://www.ed.psu.edu/acsde/deos/deosnews/deosnews1_11.asp one reference] online.) It is believed that the work started in the late 1970s under the supervision of Peter Zorkcoczy, who also conceived the OPTEL viewdata system. Radiotext denoted the transmission of data over radio signals, just as it can be sent over telephone lines. It may seem normal now, as in the [[Radio Data System]] (RDS) in these days of digital radio, but in the 1970s the concept was novel and complex for their colleagues to grasp.

* 1987, Glenn Jones of Jones Intercable in Denver, Colorado believed he saw a potential goldmine when he created a new system, called Mind Extension University in 1987. Jones created a system where telecourses could be provided across a network to various colleges and at the same time, students could interact with the instructors and each other, by using email, sent over the internet. Jones then began to beam the courses by satellite, so anyone with a satellite dish could watch the classes and if they had a computer and a phone line they could interact with the class.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jiu.edu/about/faces/profiles/glenn_jones.php Jones International University]&lt;/ref&gt;
* A group of companies in Alberta, working with Alberta Government Telephones, create a pre-internet "whiteboard-like" audiographic teleconferencing system. Using PCs, specialized NAPLPS-based software, and audioconferencing bridges, the system shares graphics, text, and voice, for synchronous multipoint instructor/student student/student communication. The system was used by the Commonwealth of Learning in several locations around the globe, and was also used by Arctic College in Alaska for distance education. In some implementations, the students uploaded assignments to instructors for marking. {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

* In datacloud|''Datacloud: Toward a New Theory of Online Work'', Johndan Johnson-Eilola describes a specific computer-supported collaboriation space: [[smart board|The Smart Board]], which was introduced in 1991. According to Johnson-Eilola, a “Smart Board system provides a 72-inch, rear projection, touchscreen, intelligent whiteboard surface for work” (79). In datacloud|''Datacloud'', Johnson-Eilola asserts that “[w]e are attempting to understand how users move within information spaces, how users can exist within information spaces rather than merely gaze at them, and how information spaces must be shared with others rather than being private, lived within rather than simply visited” (82). He explains how the Smart Board system offers an information space that allows his students to engage in active collaboration. He makes three distinct claims regarding the functionality of the technology: 1) The Smart Board allows users to work with large amounts of information, 2) It offers an information space that invites active collaboration, 3) The work produced is often “dynamic and contingent” (82).&lt;ref name="Johnson-Eilola, Johndan 2005"&gt;Johnson-Eilola, Johndan.

* Johnson-Eilola further explains that with the Smart Board “…information work becom[es] a bodied experience” (81). Users have the opportunity to engage with—inhabit—the technology by direct manipulation. Moreover, this space allows for more than one user; essentially, it invites multiple users.&lt;ref name="Johnson-Eilola, Johndan 2005"/&gt;

* Neville Gordon-Carroll and Vaughn Taylor at Microsoft launched MOLI - Microsoft Online Institute - an online learning proof of concept built as a result of an intensive research project into the future of technology based learning. The desired outcome was a platform for self-directed learning at any time, from anywhere with content that was dynamically updated and immediately relevant. MOLI was initially developed by Microsoft on the MSN proprietary platform then rapidly migrated to the internet as Microsoft embraced the internet in mid 1995. Microsoft Online Institute was a simple hosted learning platform that was made available to private and public learning institutions to conduct and experiment with their own classrooms, content and instruction model. During this time Microsoft actively evangelized internet based learning to higher education institutions, learning content developers and traditional education companies.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20909">A '''hyperforeignism''' is a type of qualitative [[hypercorrection]] that involves speakers misidentifying the distribution of a pattern found in [[loanword]]s and extending it to other environments, including words and phrases not borrowed from the language that the pattern derives from.{{sfnp|Janda|Joseph|Jacobs|1994|p=74}} The result of this process does not reflect the rules of either language.{{sfnp|Wells|1982|p=108}} For example, ''[[habanero chili|habanero]]'' is sometimes pronounced as though it were spelled with an {{angbr|[[ñ]]}} (''habañero''), which is not the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] form from which the English word was borrowed.&lt;ref name="dictionary"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/habanero |title=Habanero |website=Merriam-Webster |at=under “Variants of Habanero” |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304035502/http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/habanero |archive-date=4 March 2016 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hyperforeignisms can manifest in a number of ways, including the application of the spelling or pronunciation rules of one language to a word borrowed from another,{{sfnp|Janda|Joseph|Jacobs|1994|p=72}} an incorrect application of a language's pronunciation, and pronouncing loanwords as though they were borrowed more recently. Hyperforeignisms may similarly occur when a word is thought to be a loanword from a particular language when it is not.

Although similar, words that exhibit deliberate language-play (such as pronouncing ''Report'' with a silent {{angbr|t}} in ''[[The Colbert Report]]'' or pronouncing [[Target Corporation|Target]] as {{IPAc-en|t|ɑr|ˈ|ʒ|eɪ}} {{respell|tar|ZHAY|'}}, [[Target Corporation#Targ.C3.A9t|as though it were an upscale boutique]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = Where Target Is Always 'Tar-zhay' |first = Ylan Q. |last = Muy |url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/06/20/AR2006062001271.html |newspaper = The Washington Post |date = 21 June 2006 |accessdate = 27 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;) are not, strictly speaking, hyperforeignisms. These are, instead, a way of poking fun at those who earnestly adopt foreign-sounding pronunciations of pseudo-loanwords.{{sfnp|Janda|Joseph|Jacobs|1994|p=73}}

Similarly, speakers who echo hyperforeign pronunciations without the intention of approximating a foreign-language pattern are also not practicing hyperforeignization; thus, pronouncing ''habanero'' as if it were spelled ''habañero'' is not a hyperforeignism if one is not aware that the word has been borrowed from Spanish.{{sfnp|Janda|Joseph|Jacobs|1994|p=73}}

==English==
In English, hyperforeignisms are seen in [[loanword]]s from many different languages. Many examples of hyperforeignisms are isolated examples, rather than ones showing a particular pattern applied to multiple words and phrases, though some patterns can be identified.

Replacement with postalveolar fricatives {{IPAc-en|ʃ}} and {{IPAc-en|ʒ}} is one common mark of hyperforeignisms in English. This leads to pronouncing ‘’[[smörgåsbord]]’’ (with initial {{IPAblink|s}} in Swedish) as {{IPAc-en|ˈ|ʃ|m|ɔr|ɡ|ə|s|ˌ|b|ɔr|d}}, ''[[parmesan]]'' (from French {{IPA-fr|paʁməzɑ̃|}}) as {{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|ɑː|r|m|ə|ˌ|ʒ|ɑː|n}} (the cheese itself is Italian, and this pronunciation may also have been influenced by the Italian word for the cheese, ''parmigiano'', which has a postalveolar affricate: {{IPA-it|ˌparmiˈdʒaːno|}}), and [[Mandarin Chinese]] terms like ''[[Beijing]]'' (with {{IPAblink|tɕ}}, which sounds like {{IPAslink|dʒ}} to English speakers) with {{IPAslink|ʒ}}: {{IPAc-en|b|eɪ|ˈ|ʒ|ɪ|ŋ}}.{{sfnp|Wells|1982|p=108}}{{sfnp|Janda|Joseph|Jacobs|1994|p=80}}

===Dutch words===
In [[Dutch language|Dutch]], the letter combination {{angbr|sch}} represents {{IPA-nl|sx|}} at the beginning of a syllable, and {{IPA|[s]}} at the end. However, most English speakers pronounce Dutch words such as ''[[Rooibos]]ch'' and ''veldschoen'' with {{IPAslink|ʃ}}, more closely following the pronunciation rules for [[German language|German]] spelling.  In contrast, certain well-established Dutch surnames and place names in the [[United States]] dating to [[Thirteen Colonies|colonial times]], such as [[Schuyler (name)|Schuyler]], have {{angbr|sch}} pronounced as {{IPAc-en|s|k}}, which is relatively closer to the Dutch pronunciation.

===French words===
A number of [[List of English words of French origin|words of French origin]] feature a final {{angbr|e}} that is pronounced in English but silent in the original language. For example, ''forte'' (used to mean "strength" in English as in "not my ''forte''") is often pronounced {{IPAc-en|ˈ|f|ɔr|t|eɪ}} or {{IPAc-en|f|ɔr|ˈ|t|eɪ}}, by confusion with the Italian musical term of the same spelling (and same Latin origin, but meaning "loud"), which is pronounced {{IPAc-it|'|f|O|r|t|e|}}. In French, the word "forte" is pronounced {{IPAc-fr|f|ɔ|ʁ|t|}}, with silent final {{angbr|e}}, and the word for a person's strong point is actually "fort", with a silent t. Similarly, the noun ''cache'' is sometimes pronounced {{IPAc-en|k|æ|ʃ|eɪ}}, as though it were spelled either {{angbr|cachet}}(meaning "seal" or "signature") or {{angbr|caché}}(meaning "hidden"). In French, the final {{angbr|e}} is silent and the word is pronounced {{IPA-fr|kaʃ|}}.  The word ''cadre'' is sometimes pronounced {{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|ɑː|d|r|eɪ}} in English, as though it were of Spanish origin. In French, the final {{angbr|e}} is silent {{IPA-fr|kadʁ|}} and a common English pronunciation is {{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|ɑː|d|r|ə}}.&lt;ref name="mw"&gt;{{cite book |title=Merriam-Webster's Dictionary of English Usage |publisher=Merriam-Webster |year=1994 |ISBN=0-87779-132-5 |page=516 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2yJusP0vrdgC  |edition=revised}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Legal English]] is replete with words derived from [[Anglo-Norman language|Norman French]], which for a long time was the language of [[Courts of England and Wales|the courts in England and Wales]]. The correct pronunciation of Norman French is often closer to a natural contemporary English reading than to modern French: the attempt to pronounce these phrases as if they were modern French could therefore be considered to be a hyperforeignism. For example, the clerk's summons “[[Oyez!]]” ('Attention!') is commonly pronounced ending in a consonant, {{IPAc-en|s}} or {{IPAslink|z}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/oyez |title=Definition of oyez in English |website=Oxford Dictionaries |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304210223/http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/oyez |archive-date=4 March 2016 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A common pattern is pronouncing French loanwords without a word-final {{IPA|/r/}}, as with ''derrière'', ''peignoir'', and ''répertoire''.{{sfnp|Janda|Joseph|Jacobs|1994|p=75}}

Another common pattern, influenced by French morphophonology, is the omission of word-final consonants. Hyperforeign application of this tendency occurs with omission of these consonants in words with final consonants that ''are'' pronounced in French. This occurs notably in the term ''[[coup de grâce]]'', in which some speakers omit the final consonant {{IPAslink|s}}, although it is pronounced in French as {{IPA-fr|ku də ɡʁɑs|}}.&lt;ref name="mw" /&gt;{{sfnp|Janda|Joseph|Jacobs|1994|p=76}} Other examples of this include ''[[Vichyssoise]]'',&lt;ref name="mw"/&gt; the chess term ''[[wikt:en prise|en prise]]'', ''[[wikt:prix fixe|prix fixe]]'', and ''[[mise en scène]]''. There are many instances of this sort of omission connected with proper nouns. Some speakers may omit pronouncing a final {{IPAslink|z}} or {{IPAslink|s}} in names such as [[Camille Saint-Saëns|Saint-Saëns]], [[Marguerite Duras|Duras]], [[Pierre Boulez|Boulez]], and [[Berlioz]], though these words are pronounced in French with a final {{IPAblink|s}} or {{IPAblink|z}}.

The [[Norman French]] language furthermore gave [[Southern England]] some ancient [[family name]]s that were once associated with the aristocracy. An example is [[L'Estrange|''Lestrange'']] which is sometimes pronounced with its natural and contemporaneous French inflection, though it is more often pronounced like the English word ''strange'', {{IPAc-en|l|ɛ|s|t|r|eɪ|n|dʒ}}.

Speakers of American English typically pronounce ''[[lingerie]]'' {{IPAc-en|ˌ|l|ɒ|n|dʒ|ə|ˈ|r|eɪ}},&lt;ref name="mw"/&gt; depressing the first [[vowel]] of the French {{IPA-fr|lɛ̃ʒʁi|}} to sound more like a "typical" French [[nasal vowel]], and rhyming the final syllable with English ''ray'', by [[analogy]] with the many French loanwords ending in {{angbr|-é}}, {{angbr|-er,}}, {{angbr|-et}}, and {{angbr|-ez}}.  Similarly, the French-derived term ''repartie'' ({{IPAc-en|r|ə|p|ɑr|ˈ|t|iː}}, 'rejoinder') was changed to English spelling {{angbr|repartee}} ('banter'), giving rise to a hyperforeign {{IPAc-en|r|ə|p|ɑr|ˈ|t|eɪ}}.

''[[Claret]]'' is often pronounced {{IPAc-en|k|l|æ|ˈ|r|eɪ}}, without a final {{IPAslink|t}}. However, it is historically an Anglicised (and genericised) version of the original French ''[[clairet]]'', with the {{angbr|t}} more typically being pronounced and the stress falling on the first syllable: {{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|l|ær|ɪ|t}}.

[[Moët]], a brand of French champagne, is often wrongly pronounced with a silent "t". The name is Dutch and so the correct pronunciation is "mo-ette" or "mo-wett" [[Help:IPA for French|[moɛt]]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lucire.com/2002/0530ll0.shtml#K5rCv6CxbwYM44j8.97 |title=Moët for Linguists |last=Enting |first=Carolyn |date=2002 |website=[[Lucire]] |publisher=Jack Yan &amp; Associates |access-date=2 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indian-language words===
The {{angbr|j}} in the name of the [[Taj Mahal]] or ''[[raj (disambiguation)|raj]]'' is often rendered {{IPA|/ʒ/}}, but a closer approximation to the [[Hindi]] sound is {{IPAslink|dʒ}}.{{sfnp|Wells|1982|p=108}} The {{angbr|j}} in most words associated with languages of [[India]] is more accurately approximated as {{IPAslink|dʒ}}.

Another example is the pronunciation of ''[[Punjab region|Punjab]]'' as {{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|ʊ|n|dʒ|ɑː|b}}; a closer approximation to the original is {{IPAc-en|audio=Punjab.ogg|ˈ|p|ʌ|n|dʒ|ɑː|b}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pronouncenames.com/pronounce/punjab |title=How to say or pronounce Punjab |website=Pronounce Names |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307175455/http://pronouncenames.com/pronounce/punjab |archive-date=7 March 2016 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; This spelling of "Punjab" dates to British colonial rule and is intended to be pronounced according to English spelling rules, as with other words borrowed from Indian languages into English, such as [[curry]], [[suttee]], and [[mulligatawny]], or other colonial-era names ("[[Calcutta]]"); a closer Romanization of the name is "Panjāb", from Persian for "five waters".

===Italian words===
The {{angbr|g}} in ''[[Tempo#Basic tempo markings|Adagio]]'' may be realized as {{IPAslink|ʒ}}, even though the "soft" {{angbr|g}} of [[Italian language|Italian]] represents an affricate {{IPAblink|dʒ}}.{{sfnp|Wells|1982|p=108}} Similarly, English-speaking musicians render the Italian word ''mezzo'' as {{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|ɛ|t|s|oʊ}}, as in the commonly used Italian loan-word ''pizza'', though the Italian pronunciation is {{IPA-it|ˈmɛddzo|}}, with a voiced {{IPAblink|dz}}, rather than a voiceless {{IPAblink|ts}}.

The name of the principal male character in Shakespeare's ''[[The Taming of the Shrew]]'' is spelled {{angbr|[[Petruchio]]}}, intended to be the Italian name ''Petruccio'' ({{IPA-it|peˈtruttʃo|}}), reflecting more conventional English pronunciation rules that use {{angbr|ch}} to represent {{IPAslink|tʃ}}. However, the name is commonly pronounced {{IPAc-en|p|ɛ|ˈ|t|r|uː|k|i|oʊ}}, as though Shakespeare's spelling is genuinely Italian.

Substituting ''baristo'' for a male [[barista]], when in fact ''barista'' is invariable in gender in Italian and Spanish (as are other words ending in the suffix ''-ista'') is a hyperforeignism. In Italian (and Spanish), the gender is indicated by the article; '''''il''' ('''el''') barista'' for a male and '''''la''' barista'' for a female.

The word ''latte'' ('milk'), as in ''caffè latte'', is often misspelled as {{angbr|latté}} or {{angbr|lattè}}, implying stress on the final syllable. However, ''latte'' has no accent mark in Italian and has the stress on the first syllable. This may be an analogy with French words such as ''frappé'' {{IPA-it|fraˈpe|}}, where there is such an accent mark.

Italian {{angbr|sch}}, as in ''maraschino'' or the brand name ''Freschetta'', is often mispronounced as English "sh" rather than the correct "sk", due to greater familiarity with the German pronunciation due to, for example, German surnames among Americans.

===Russian words===
Because the [[List of English words of Russian origin|Russian loanword]] ''dacha'' (дача {{IPA-ru|ˈdatɕə|}}) looks like it could be German, the pronunciation {{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|ɑː|x|ə}}, with a velar fricative, shows an attempt at marking a word as foreign, but with a sound not originally present in the source word.{{sfnp|Janda|Joseph|Jacobs|1994|pp=72, 75}}  The more common pronunciation is {{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|ɑː|tʃ|ə}}, which sounds closer to the original Russian word.

===Spanish words===
The [[digraph (orthography)|digraph]] {{angbr|ch}} of [[Spanish language|Spanish]] generally represents {{IPAblink|tʃ}}, similar to English {{angbr|ch}}.  Hyperforeign realizations of many [[List of English words of Spanish origin|Spanish loanwords]] or proper names may substitute other sounds.  Examples include a French-style {{IPAblink|ʃ}} in the surname ''[[Chávez (surname)|Chávez]]'' and in ''[[Che Guevara]]'', or a [[German language|German]]-influenced {{IPA|[x]}} or [[Ancient Greek]]-&lt;!-- since Modern Greek letter Chi would be pronounced as /x/ or /ç/ instead of the aspirated /k/ of Ancient Greek; DO NOT REMOVE "Ancient"--&gt;influenced {{IPA|[k]}} in ''machismo''.{{sfnp|Wells|1982|p=108}}  The {{angbr|z}} in the Spanish word ''chorizo'' is sometimes realized as {{IPAc-en|t|s}} by English speakers, reflecting more closely the pronunciation of the double letter {{angbr|zz}} in Italian and [[List of English words of Italian origin|Italian loanwords]] in English.  This is not the pronunciation of present-day Spanish, however.  Rather, the {{angbr|z}} in ''chorizo'' represents {{IPAblink|θ}} or {{IPAblink|s}} ([[Phonological history of Spanish coronal fricatives|depending on dialect]]) in Spanish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Quinn |first=Sue |title=Mispronounced food words: can you say chorizo? |url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2014/feb/13/mispronounced-food-words-chorizo-restaurateur-cardamom |work=[[The Guardian]] |publisher=Guardian News and Media |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160514043431/http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2014/feb/13/mispronounced-food-words-chorizo-restaurateur-cardamom |archive-date=14 May 2016 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some English speakers pronounce certain words of Spanish origin as if they had a [[tilde]] when they do not in the original language. For example, the word ''[[habanero]]'' is pronounced {{IPA-es|aβaˈneɾo|}} (without the tilde) in Spanish. English speakers may instead pronounce it {{IPAc-en|ˌ|h|ɑː|b|ə|ˈ|n|j|ɛr|oʊ}}, as if it were spelled {{angbr|habañero}}; the phenomenon also occurs with ''[[empanada]]'', which may be pronounced as if it is spelled {{angbr|empañada}}. The city of [[Cartagena, Colombia|Cartagena]], Colombia is very commonly pronounced as if it were spelled {{angbr|Cartageña}}.

The South American beverage, [[Mate (beverage)|mate]], is frequently spelled {{angbr|maté}} in English, adding an accent which, in Spanish, changes the pronunciation and meaning of the word (''maté'' meaning 'I killed' in Spanish). The accented spelling may however serve a purpose, as it is interpreted by some English speakers to indicate that the word has two syllables and is not pronounced like the English word ''mate'' ({{IPAc-en|m|eɪ|t}}). Following Spanish orthography though, the only 'correct' place to add an accent which matches the natural stress of the word (and therefore does not change its pronunciation) would be as "máte".

==Other languages==

===Polish===
Hyperforeignisms occur in Polish sometimes with English loanwords or names. One example would be the name [[Roosevelt (name)|Roosevelt]], which is pronounced {{IPA-pl|ˈruzvɛlt|}}, as if it started like ''goose'', even though a natural Polish pronunciation would be closer to the English one.

''Phenian'', now obsolete name for [[Pyongyang]], which was a transcription of Russian {{lang|ru|Пхеньян}}, was pronounced {{IPA-pl|'fɛɲan|}}, as if 'ph' represented [[voiceless labiodental fricative]] like in English.&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Phenian&lt;/ref&gt;

Loanwords from Japanese are often subject to hyperforeignism. The names of three of the four main islands of Japan, ''Honsiu'', ''Kiusiu'', and ''Sikoku'', are already Polish transcriptions with close approximations of Japanese sounds - {{IPA-pl|ˈhɔnɕu|}}, {{IPA-pl|ˈkʲuɕu|}}, {{IPA-pl|ɕiˈkɔku|}}, but are often pronounced with changing native {{IPA|/ɕ/}} into "foreign" {{IPA|/sj/}}. Other Japanese words use English transcription, which causes further problems. ''Tsunami'', which in original Japanese has the sound {{IPA|/t͡s/}}, present in Polish, is pronounced with effort to separate {{IPA|/t/}} and {{IPA|/s/}}, since it sounds more "foreign".

===Russian===

In [[Russian language|Russian]], many early loanwords are pronounced as native Russian words with full [[Palatalization (phonetics)|palatalization]]. Hyperforeignism occurs when some speakers pronounce these early loanwords without palatalization. For example: [[wikt:тема|'''т'''ема]] ('theme') is normally pronounced {{IPA-ru|ˈtʲɛmə|}}. A hyperforeign pronunciation would be {{IPA-ru|ˈtɛmə|}}, as if the word were spelled {{angbr|тэма}}. Similarly, [[wikt:текст|'''т'''екст]] ('text') is pronounced {{IPA-ru|tʲɛkst|}}, with the hyperforeign pronunciation being {{IPA-ru|tɛkst|}}, as if it were spelled {{angbr|тэкст}}. Other examples include [[wikt:музей|му'''з'''ей]] ('museum') {{IPA-ru|muˈzʲej|}} &gt; {{IPA-ru|muˈzej|}}, [[wikt:газета|га'''з'''ета]] ('gazette') {{IPA-ru|ɡɐˈzʲɛtə|}} &gt; {{IPA-ru|ɡɐˈzɛtə|}} and [[wikt:эффект|эф'''ф'''ект]] ('effect') {{IPA-ru|ɨfʲˈfʲɛkt|}} {{IPA-ru|ɨfˈfɛkt|}}. The variation is attributable to the tendency to use {{angbr|е}} in foreign words after a consonant, even if it is not palatalized.

===Swedish===

In [[Swedish language|Swedish]] ''chevré'' (as in ''chevré[ost]'' for '[[chèvre cheese]]') is pronounced quite differently from the original [[French language|French]] ''[[wikt:chèvre|chèvre]]'' (possibly by false analogy with the Swedish "grevé" cheese, ''[[grevé]]ost'').

Similarly ''[[entrecôte]]'', which can often be spelled {{angbr|entrecoté}}, or {{angbr|entrêcotè}}, or some other combination of {{angbr|[[^]]}} and {{angbr|[[`]]}} or {{angbr|[[´]]}}. More often than not, it is pronounced without a final {{IPAblink|t}}.

===Norwegian===

Like in Swedish, in [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] the entrecôte can be pronounced without the final {{IPAblink|t}}. This might also happen in ''pommes frites'' ([[french fries]]), and the {{IPAblink|z}} is often removed in the pronunciation of [[Béarnaise sauce]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://k7bulletin.no/entreka-med-pamm-fri-og-baerne-takk/ Entrekå med påmm fri og bærné, takk] - K7 Bulletin (Norwegian)&lt;/ref&gt; Also, non-French Latin words are pronounced with French rules, such as [[Tenerife]], [[Don Quixote]], [[Lasagne]] and [[Spaghetti Bolognese]] are all pronounced without the final -e, none of which is correct Norwegian, despite being in common usage.

[[File:IfU Logo.jpg|right|thumb|400px]]
'''''Institut für Unternehmenskybernetik''''' (abbreviated '''''IfU'''''), is a German research institution dedicated to advancing the study of [[Entrepreneurial cybernetics]] and [[management cybernetics]], founded in 1988 and located in [[Aachen]], Germany.

== Overview ==
[[File:rwth.png|left|thumb|200px]]
The IfU is a widely dispersed networked institute, composed of members from exceedingly differentiated disciplines. As an affiliated institute of the [[RWTH Aachen University]] since 2003, the IfU is in constant contact with numerous other institutes associated with the university (e.g. Textile Technologies, the Research Institute for Rationalisation, and the Fraunhofer Institute for Production Technology). Moreover, the IfU is a member association of the AiF (German Federation of Industrial Research Associations), representing the 'management cybernetics' sector, and is therefore a contact partner for many interdisciplinary research projects. As an application orientated research institute, the IfU has been developing methods and tools specifically designed to fit the needs of small and medium-sized enterprises since 1988. In doing so it pursues the principal ‘out of the practice for the practice’ with an inductive research paradigm:{{clarify|date=June 2013}}

:''"In interdisciplinary research projects we seek to develop practical solutions with the aid of our research partners.  These solutions will be implemented and evaluated in all enterprises concerned.  The theories of [[Stafford Beer]], [[Frederic Vester]], [[Fredmund Malik]], [[Klaus Henning]] as well as [[Humberto Maturana]] and [[Francisco Varela]] (amongst others) form the scientific bases of our work."''

== Entrepreneurial Cybernetics ==
Introducing the institute, IfU focuses on the interaction between people, technology and organisations taking place within small to medium-sized enterprises. The Institute for Management of Cybernetics regards businesses as living systems, which convert information and resources into products or services through a series of compound processes. As a practice orientated and interdisciplinary science, the IfU aims to optimize these business processes by means of development and publishing of scientifically proven methods. The procedures implemented are always based on cybernetic principles- and in particular on the idea of a control loop, or feedback. This means that internal business processes are not straightforward input-output relationships but are constantly being influenced and changed by their own outcomes, i.e. they are recursive. Such a principal can have both aiding and debilitating effects but the IfU aims to help businesses implement and use it profitably.

Being able to recognise enterprises as open, socio-technological, economic, multifaceted and networked systems, the IfU helps to describe and explain the complex phenomena which occur within these contexts.

== Cooperation ==

The Institute for Management Cybernetics e.V. (IfU) forms an institute cluster with the Center for Learning and Knowledge Management and the Department of Information Management in Mechanical Engineering at the RWTH Aachen University.

== Areas of Expertise; introducing projects carried out by IfU ==

The IfU carried out projects in several areas of expertise; these cover cost-effectiveness, micro and start-up enterprises, co-operations processes and change management and are explained below in more detail.

===Cost Effectiveness===

When estimating cost-effectiveness, the IfU places emphasis on both hard factors (e.g. costs, time) and soft factors (e.g. employee motivation and the communication culture) in its approach to economic appraisal. Following this initiative, an extensive overview of a business can be achieved. The NOWS technique (use-orientated cost-effectiveness evaluation) is one of the main software tools developed by IfU, as a means of helping enterprises make a profitability analysis. Because falsely estimated investments can steer companies towards crisis situations, it is very important that every decision maker considers all factors before making an investment. The software tool creates a graph based on all the factors integrated into the system, and as a result presents the enterprises with the best possible option of investment. Diverse aspects are considered in the analysis, leaving little to no room for insecurities; a stable investment scenario is presented.

Consequently, several projects profited from this method; NowBITs - investments in computing services were valued and a code of practice was compiled. AutoPreforms - the efficient manufacture of fibre reinforced composites in the car industry.

===Micro and start-up enterprises===

For over ten years, the IfU has been aiming to find solutions in helping micro and start-up enterprises with the management of resources. Once the start-up incentives have phased-out, many young businesses reach a critical stage which is marked by a high number of bankruptcies. The reasons for failure of young businesses are multifaceted but are often associated with lack of experience. An exemplary undertaking is the Jungunternehmen Project - a method map was developed to provide the enterprises that reach this critical stage with the necessary support.

===Co-operation Processes===

Additionally, with the intent to help enterprises use limited resources more efficiently by converting relevant information into applicable knowledge, the IfU researches success factors in co-operations processes and co-ordinates corresponding joint projects. To illustrate the work carried out in this field, in project SENEKA (Service networks for Education and Further Education ) the IfU has co-ordinated the cross-sectional task of innovation management.

===Change Management===

As stipulated previously, the IfU carried out several projects in the field of change management to help organisations adapt to the fluctuating market conditions. CuBa Change is one of the newer developments. The project’s objective is to develop a practical and easy process of quality-orientated safeguard and adoption of Changes Processes for SMEs, whilst abiding by the more fundamental features of corporate culture. In this way a management-specific situational analysis of Change-Proposals will be enabled, increasing the likelihood of success and the ability to cope with the constant need to adapt to change.

A '''kronkåsa''' ({{lang-sv|crown cup}}, plural ''kronkåsor'') is a form of elaborate drinking [[cup]] that was used during the [[Renaissance]] in Sweden.

==Description==
A kronkåsa is a drinking vessel where the handles are exaggeratedly long and elaborate, thus forming a kind of crown above the cup, hence the name. The crown cups made during the Renaissance were carved from a single root of [[spruce]] trees.&lt;ref name=carlotta&gt;{{cite web |url= http://62.88.129.39/carlotta/web/object/36325|title= Kronkåsa med dekorationer|language=Swedish|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website= |publisher= [[Göteborg City Museum]]|access-date= 1 November 2016|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later copies from the 19th century were made using other types of wood.&lt;ref name=nm&gt;{{cite web |url= http://nationalmuseum.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:990146/FULLTEXT01.pdf|title= Gustaf Banér and Christina Sture’s Drinking Cup from 1589|last1= Ernstell|first1= Micael|last2= |first2= |date= |website= |publisher= [[Nationalmuseum]]|access-date= 1 November 2016|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The decoration of the crown is likely derived from forms found in the woodwork details of imported late [[Gothic art|Gothic]] [[altarpiece]]s. Many of the cups were painted brightly red.&lt;ref name=nm/&gt;

==History==
Kronkåsor were used in Sweden during the Renaissance as a form of elaborate drinking vessel among the [[Swedish nobility]].&lt;ref name=nm /&gt; Although little is known of their origin, it has been suggested that they reflect an old tradition of elaborately carved wooden drinking vessels popular in [[Northern Europe|Northern]] and [[Eastern Europe]].&lt;ref name=carlotta/&gt; The popularity of kronkåsor during the 16th century coincides with a breakthrough in the quality and popularity of wood carving as an art in general in Sweden.&lt;ref name=nm/&gt; According to [[Olaus Magnus]], writing in his ''[[A Description of the Northern Peoples]]'' in 1555, kronkåsor were made in south-western [[Finland]] (at the time part of the Swedish realm) and possibly in [[Västerbotten]]. About 20 kronkåsor survive to this day, most of them preserved in museums. Many of them are intimately connected to the [[Bielke|Bielke family]].&lt;ref name=nm/&gt;&lt;ref name=slm&gt;{{cite web |url= http://sokisamlingar.sormlandsmuseum.se/items/show/298107|title= Kronkåsa |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website= |publisher=[[Sörmland Museum]]|access-date=1 November 2016 |quote= |language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the [[Swedish National Heritage Board]] was created in 1630, its objective was to preserve ancient monuments and cultural heritage, including kronkåsor.&lt;ref name=nm/&gt;

==Usage==
Kronkåsor were probably used during festive occasions and seem to have been only used by members of the nobility.&lt;ref name=carlotta/&gt;&lt;ref name=nm/&gt;

In [[cultural anthropology]], a '''leveling mechanism''' is a practice that acts to ensure [[social equality]], usually by shaming or humbling members of a group that attempt to put themselves above other members.&lt;ref name=routledge&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://cw.routledge.com/textbooks/9780415485395/glossary.asp |title=Cultural Anthropology: Global Forces, Local Issues - Student Resources Glossary|author=Eller, Jack David |publisher=[[Routledge]] |work=Cultural Anthropology: Global Forces, Local Lives |accessdate=28 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

One commonly given example of a leveling mechanism is the [[ǃKung people|!Kung]] practice of "shaming the meat", particularly as illustrated by the Canadian anthropologist [[Richard Borshay Lee]] in his article "Eating Christmas in the Kalahari" (1969).&lt;ref name="christmas"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://windward.hawaii.edu/facstaff/dagrossa-p/articles/EatingChristmas.pdf |title=Eating Christmas in the Kalahari |publisher=[[American Museum of Natural History]] |year=1969 |format=PDF |accessdate=2010-09-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100704230658/http://windward.hawaii.edu/facstaff/dagrossa-p/articles/EatingChristmas.pdf |archivedate=2010-07-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; When Lee gave the !Kung an ox as a Christmas gift, the !Kung responded by insulting the gift, calling it a "bag of bones" and joking that they would have to eat the horns because there was no meat on it. Lee later asked a man named Tomazo why his gift was insulted in this way. He responded that it was because the gift was arrogant. Lee asked what he meant by this and was told:

{{quote|"Yes, when a young man kills much meat he comes to think of himself as a chief or a big man, and he thinks of the rest of us as his servants or inferiors. We can’t accept this. We refuse one who boasts, for someday his pride will make him kill somebody. So we always speak of his meat as worthless. This way we cool his heart and make him gentle."|Tomazo|"Eating Christmas in the Kalahari" &lt;ref name="christmas"/&gt;}}

'''Li Shoon''' is a fictional villain of [[China|Chinese]] ethnicity created by [[H. Irving Hancock]], first published in 1916. 
 
As common in the [[Pulp magazine|pulp]] fiction of the times, the depiction of Li Shoon had considerable [[racial stereotypes]].{{fact|date=October 2012}} He was described as being "tall and stout" and having "a round, moonlike yellow face" topped by "bulging eyebrows" and "sunken eyes". He has "an amazing compound of evil" which makes him "a wonder at everything wicked" and "a marvel of satanic cunning." 

Li Shoon is the absolute master of a secret society known as "Ui Kwoon Ah-How" whose membership numbers in the thousands or tens of thousands - not only Chinese like himself but also other Asian peoples including Filipinos as well as [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malays]], [[India]]ns, [[Japanese people|Japanese]] and various other "[[Oriental]]" ethnic groups. Members of the group kill unhesitatingly at his command, and he frequently gives such commands.  Li Shoon is not a mere criminal, but a fanatic Chinese [[nationalist]] of a sort. He engages in numerous lucrative criminal activities, but these are not a goal in itself but a means to make the society under his control "the wealthiest and most powerful body on earth" and thereby "rousing China from her centuries of sleep" to "take over mastery of Asia". There is no explanation given why the other Asians involved (especially, the Japanese, whose own imperial ambitions were far more manifest at the time) would be so eager to achieve that goal. 

Li Shoon has numerous ingenious weapons at his disposal, such as the "gas gun", which leaves no trace and keeps detectives puzzled, and the "lachesis venom" whose victims' bodies become monstrously bloated. He has two trusted helpers and lieutenants, the Chinese Weng-yu and the [[Mongols|Mongolian]] Ming who deals with torture and executions. 

Li Shoon's arch-enemy is an American "gentleman adventurer" named Donald Carrick, nicknamed "The Human Hound". [[Pulp magazine|Pulp fiction]] researcher [[Jess Nevins]] noted that Carrick is "vain, self-satisfied, supernaturally lucky and supernaturally aggravating.(...) Rarely has one 'good guy' been so capable of driving a reader into the arms of the story's putative 'bad guy'."&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20091027131214/http://www.geocities.com/jjnevins/pulpsl.html Jess Nevins, "Pulp and adventure heroes from A to Z, at]&lt;/ref&gt;   In the end, as was invariable in this subgenre, Carrick managed to kill Li Shoon after numerous daring adventures, chases by car and plane, explosions and acts of piracy on the open sea. However, Hancock brought Li Shoon back in a sequel and then killed him off once again. Altogether, it seems no accident that the series was named for Li Shoon and not for Carrick.

As Nevins notes, "Li Shoon was a chip from the [[Fu Manchu]] block". It should also be noted that the stories appeared shortly after the publication of [[Jack London]]'s ''[[The Unparalleled Invasion]]'', in which Chinese expansion over Asia was presented as "a major threat to the world" ultimately justifying a complete [[genocide]].

[[Cameroon]]ian literature is literature from Cameroon, which includes literature in French, English and indigenous languages.

==Overview==

Colonial-era writers such as [[Louis-Marie Pouka]] and [[Sankie Maimo]] were educated by European missionary societies and advocated [[cultural assimilation|assimilation]] into European culture as the means to bring Cameroon into the modern world.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mbaku|Mbaku]] 80–1&lt;/ref&gt; After [[World War II]], writers such as [[Mongo Beti]] and [[Ferdinand Oyono]] analysed and criticised colonialism and rejected assimilation.&lt;ref&gt;Fitzpatrick, Mary (2002). "Cameroon." Lonely Planet West Africa, 5th ed. China: Lonely Planet Publications Pty Ltd., p. 38&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mbaku|Mbaku]] 77, 83–4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Volet, Jean-Marie (10 November 2006). "Cameroon Literature at a glance". Reading women writers and African literatures. Accessed 6 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Other older generation writers include [[Guillaume Oyônô Mbia]], [[Mbella Sonne Dipoko]], [[Francis Bebey]], [[René Philombé]] and [[kenjo Jumbam]].

Some critically acclaimed writers include [[Imbolo Mbue]], [[Patrice Nganang]], [[Calixthe Beyala]], [[Bate Besong]], [[Gaston-Paul Effa]], [[Werewere Liking]], [[Ba'bila Mutia]], [[John Nkemngong Nkengasong]], [[Bole Butake]], [[Leonora Miano]], [[Francis B Nyamnjoh]] and [[Linus T. Asong]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://library.osu.edu/literary-map-of-africa/countries/cameroon Library.osu.edu]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://bakwamagazine.com/2012/03/07/commentary-anglophone-cameroon-literature-the-travails-of-a-minority-literature/ Bakwamagazine.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, [[Imbolo Mbue]] signed a million dollar deal with [[Random House]] for her debut manuscript. The novel titled ''[[Behold the Dreamers]]'' follows the travails of a Cameroonian immigrant and a [[Lehman Brothers]] executive during the 2008 financial crisis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bakwamagazine.com/2015/11/26/wall-street-journal-unveils-the-face-behind-africas-most-anticipated-novel/ Bakwamagazine.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/international/Frankfurt-Book-Fair/article/64277-frankfurt-book-fair-2014-in-pre-fair-deals-two-debuts-draw-seven-figures.html Publishers Weekly]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary awards==
International and bilingual English-and-French literary prizes, [[Grand Prix of Literary Associations]] (GPLA), were launched in Cameroon in 2013,&lt;ref&gt;Source: [https://www.bellanaija.com/2017/03/grand-prix-of-literary-associations-2016-d-day-coming-closer/ Bellanaija.com]&lt;/ref&gt; and are to date the main literary awards in Cameroon. They have already contributed to unveil or confirm many gifted authors, such as [[Eric Mendi]], twice winner in the Belles-Lettres Category,&lt;ref&gt;Source: [http://bamendaonline.net/blog/eric-mendi-twice-winner-of-the-grand-of-prix-of-literary-associations/ Bamendaonline]&lt;/ref&gt; [[:fr:Charles Salé|Charles Salé]], [[Fiston Mwanza Mujila]],&lt;ref&gt;Source: [https://editions-metailie.com/prix/grands-prix-des-associations-litteraires-gpal-dans-la-categorie-belles-lettres/ Métailié.com]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Felwine Sarr]],&lt;ref&gt;Source: [https://www.senenews.com/2017/03/15/felwine-sarr-et-eric-mendi-laureats-des-grands-prix-des-associations-litteraires-2016_184015.html Senenews.com]&lt;/ref&gt; to name a few. The GPLA also pay tribute to deceased authors through the ''Grand prix de la mémoire'', which was awarded to late Cameroonian author [[Sankie Maimo]] in the last edition (GPLA 2016).&lt;ref&gt;Source: [http://bamendaonline.net/blog/gpla-2016-pays-tribute-to-sankie-maimo-and-other-contemporary-authors/ Bamendaonline]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19081">'''Modular music''' is [[music]] that originates from the combination and overlapping of different compositions one over the other. The compositions —also called [[modules]]— are written by one or many different composers in different moments. New modules can be added or removed to create a totally new work, a new composition, different from the original one.
A modular composition can be expanded and extended in time, space and size.

==Origins==
In the high Medieval times, French monks discovered that superimposing two melodies and playing them contemporaneously would generate interesting acoustics. They really witnessed innovative acoustic combinations: the [[counterpoint]]; at first applied exclusively to voices, it came to fruition in Renaissance. The term originates from the Latin ''punctus contra punctum'', meaning "point against point".

==Modular method in music==
By combining compositions rather than melodies, one obtains a '''modular project'''. The term “project” is more appropriate than “composition” because the shape of the work is not fixed and it will change when a new composition (module) is added or removed.
The concept of a musical work seen as something closed, limited and immobile evolves into a process of numerous aggregations that allow a composition to become infinite in principle. A modular project is a work in progress. Once a composition is completed, anyone can join in and take part to it, by adding new modules or even by removing modules that are considered unsuitable. The original module attracts new artists and stimulate them to create new works or compositions to be combined with the pre-existing modules. Each module, in turn, may become an original piece, a new starting point for other artists to join in and start a new process of aggregation.
There are no limits; each composer or artist is free to manage his or her material, add or remove modules in any way or form, without changing the original works created by another modular composers. The only rule of the modular method is that none is allowed to modify a module: composers can choose a combination of modules, can add his/her own works but cannot absolutely modify a pre-existing module.

In music history, however, there are examples of famous composers using the modular method unaware: [[Charles Gounod]] (1818–1893) composed his famous ''Ave Maria'' by adding a melody to the I Prelude in C major from [[Das Wohltemperierte Klavier]] by [[J. S. Bach]] (1685–1750). Neither one of the two composers willingly adopted the modular method of composition for their respective works; however, these are examples of modular music.

Furthermore, the term '''Modular''' and/or '''Modular Music''' is often applied nowadays to [[Electronic Music]] especially: examples can be found in the [[Serge synthesizer]], [[Modular synthesizer]], in the work of composer and performer [[Scot Gresham-Lancaster]], one of the early pioneers of "computer network" music which uses the behavior of interconnected music machines to create innovative ways for performers and computers to interact. Electronic music composer [[André Stordeur]] who composes exclusively on Serge synthesizer and in 2009 appeared on a version of [[Giacinto Scelsi]]'s ''Tre Canti Popolari'', published by the [[Sub Rosa (label)]], where he played electronic distortion of live instruments. The music of [[Disc Jockey]] can be as well considered a modern example of modular music, where different and independent modules are mixed rather than overlapped, played simultaneously and the third modules represented by the Dj him/herself who interacts with the two ongoing modules (tracks).

==Technique==

“In the initial approach, the artist may choose any stile, instrument and musical form, with no limits for the composer’s creativity“, whatsoever.
“Once the first musical work is completed, which will be defined as Module A or original module, it becomes an opportunity for new composers to develop it by extending its dimension, fully respecting its integrity.
Modular composers, stimulated by the original work may in turn add their own creations, again expanding the original piece. This creates a hierarchy of modules. The first composition, '''the original module''', becomes module A, the second or additional work added by another modular composer, becomes module B, and so on“.&lt;ref&gt;Falcon Valley Music Editors, Stefano Vagnini ''The Modular Method in Music, Views of an Open Art'', English and Italian, pp. 9, Rome, Italy, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

===Continuous aggregations===
“Once located the original module (A), the composer of successive modules will aggregate with module B anticipating performance of his composition to be executed with the original module.
The following solutions therefore: A, or A+B.
Upon the superimposition of ulterior modules (C, D, E …), the composition is well into the process of extension. The execution or performance of the individual pieces B and C as autonomous compositions is not expected.
Not to be excluded the possibility of accepting modules B or C as original in terms of developing and expanding the creation replacing module A. 
In fact nothing is to prevent further development by a third composer ignoring modules B or C and creating a new B module which will inaugurate a new expansionary orientation. This is referred to as '''Parallel Aggregations'''“.&lt;ref&gt;Falcon Valley Music Editors, Stefano Vagnini ''The Modular Method in Music, Views of an Open Art'', English and Italian, pp. 10-11, Rome, Italy, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

===Independent aggregations===
“When it is possible to perform the various modules according to a random selection, it becomes an independent aggregation. The original module A may be performed alone or in combination with the modules B and C. The same can be said for each module A,B and C.
The letters associated with each module are chronological references as to when the works were composed.
Any combination is therefore possible: A, A+B, B, B+C, A+C, C, A+B+C“.&lt;ref&gt;Falcon Valley Music Editors, Stefano Vagnini ''The Modular Method in Music, Views of an Open Art'', English and Italian, pp. 11, Rome, Italy, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mixed aggregations===
“Modular scores may be developed on various planes (continuous aggregations and independent aggregations) each following their developmental criteria and rules of combination.

The aggregation to a modular project may in turn be constructed following the modular method described; that, which is valid for the macro-structure, is applicable to the internal development of individual modules, thus creating further sub module aggregations limited, however, in the level of intervention therefore establishing:

===Negative aggregations===
One exception to the rule which prohibits modifications to existing modules retained valid, is a  particular case of aggregation: '''negative aggregation''' or of silences.
Although there are no changes to the fundamental score in existence, the application of silences suppresses and eliminates some precise moments. Silences obscure, not because of disapproval but for added stimulation not as a result of what it did not do but a conquest of making an algebraic negative sign resulting in a spectacular motion of opposing an aggregation already occurred.“&lt;ref&gt;Falcon Valley Music Editors, Stefano Vagnini ''The Modular Method in Music, Views of an Open Art'', English and Italian, pp. 11-12, Rome, Italy, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

==Composers==

===Theorist===
The modular method in music has been theorized in 1998 by an Italian composer and arts theoretician, [[Stefano Vagnini]],&lt;ref&gt;Rai Italian Television, Giorgia Ragni Interview on Stefano Vagnini's ModulArt https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3brCx3wWr0I&lt;/ref&gt; who developed his theory of open-source composition based on modular aggregation.
Writer, painter, and art theorist Gian Ruggero Manzoni described the modular music of Vagnini's compositions as “circular like the existence, his works are not finished, but merely stimulus for new voices”.&lt;ref&gt;Gian Ruggero Manzoni, in: Vagnini, Stefano: SalmodieSubliminali, Campanotto Editions, Udine, 2007, pp 7–8&lt;/ref&gt;
Greek history university professor Umberto Bultrighini describes "Vagnini '''Modular Music’s''' ability to satisfy old needs and combine them with modern technology. ModulArt as the key answer to the need of defining the artist's work, finding the right balance between art, audience and copyrights".&lt;ref&gt;Umberto Bultrighini, Vagnini, ''The Modular Method in Music, Views of an Open Art'', English and Italian, pp 57, Rome: Falcon Valley Music, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

===Composers===
Since 2000 the modular methodology has been spread involving worldwide composers through many modular projects. Several such compositions were performed in Europe, South America, Asia and in North America and discussed through conferences in Europe and in the United States. The approach is being academically discussed at the [[University of West Georgia]]&lt;ref&gt;University of West Georgia official website page: “Italian artists bring a new view of Art, Music and Literature to UWGhttp://www.westga.edu/ucmassets/news/2575.php&lt;/ref&gt; and the Carrollton Cultural Arts Centre in the USA, at the “G. D’Annunzio” University of Chieti–Pescara Italy, and at the [[University of Strathclyde]] in Glasgow, Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;University of Strathclyde official website page: “Glasgow University International Organ Project 2012: The Facebach Project http://www.gla.ac.uk/events/?action=details&amp;id=6117&lt;/ref&gt; 
Minas Borboudakis has dedicated the third part of his trilogy ''ROAI III'' for piano and electronics to the modular methodology.
The composer [[Andy DiGelsomina]] has featured variations on the modular approach in his recent "Lyraka Symphony no. 1", which he elaborates on (with musical examples) in his personal blog. &lt;ref&gt;http://andydigelsomina.blogspot.com/2017/04/lyraka-symphony-no-1-mvt-5.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modularity and other art languages==

=== Visual art===
Modularity can be applied to every language of art in many different ways.

[[Marcel Duchamp]]'s intervention on Leonardo’s Monna Lisa: the moustache is, in all ways, a modular effect.
Greek-born conceptual artist [[Leda Luss Luyken]], who was initially trained as an architect, has been exploring [[ModulArt]] in the medium of painting since the 1990s. In her work standardized canvas panels are mounted as modules onto a steel frame within which they can be moved and rotated.
American artist [[Mitzi Cunliffe]] developed sculptures consisting of multiple blocks about twelve inches square which she put together in a variety of combinations to give a sculptured effect on a large scale.
Another portfolio of interactive modular art comes out of Studio for A.R.T. and Architecture, a New York-based firm headed by Donald Rattner.&lt;ref&gt;[Rattner, Donald]. "A Comparison of Conventional and Modular Art" in ''[http://issuu.com/art-rethought/docs/art_catalogue?viewMode=magazine&amp;mode=embed A.R.T. Catalogue v2.0]''. New York: lulu.com, 2010. Pp. C-1ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Rattner has designed modular art in the media of wall sculpture, rotational paintings, tapestries, artist's wallpapers and artist's books.
The Gruppo 1, made up of Biggi, Frascà, Pace, Santoro, Uncini and Carrino, in the  1960s elaborated a conception of sculpture being a collective project with works developed by assembling basic elements—modules, in the true sense of the word—which could be modified in any moment, sometimes with the intervention of the public.
The term ''modular'' applied to visual arts was first mentioned in 1975 in a German arts encyclopedia as "a form of art […] made by movable elements that […] transfer the object into a new state of being by moving their variable parts"&lt;ref&gt;Ludewig, Werner (Ed.). ''Kunst – Literatur – Musik, Daten und Fakten''. Lexikon-Institut Bertelsmann, 1975, p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Poetry===
''SalmodieSubliminali'' (Campanotto Editions, Udine, 2007) is a book of modular poems&lt;ref&gt;Campanotto Ed. ''Salmodie Subliminali'', Udine, Italy, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; in which Stefano Vagnini connects words so that new meanings comes out from the sentence. Every line can be extended with new words, always connected.

===Polimediality===
When different languages coexist, multimediality becomes a natural opening for the modular work. The artist's desire to experiment is combined with the necessity to adapt to codes and communicative languages in constant evolution.  Using at the same time different languages is not just the research of innovative aesthetic solutions, superficial strategy used to capture who enjoys with distraction; multimediality becomes, by  modular art, a natural answer to the artist that wants to join the project.
In Modular Music, the term ''polimediality'' is preferred, because a multimedia work is usually already conceived as a multi-art language work. In a modular project, the opportunity to add modules using different languages depends on the artist who decides to join the work.

===Coexistence of cultures===
In a modular project, many different cultures can coexist in the project without having to use a hybrid language. Coexistence so that people can enjoy the taste of the combination of different cultural expressions and traditions.
Modular art must be considered an alternative to that phenomenon called contamination.

=== Via Crucis===
[[Stefano Vagnini]]'s 2002 modular oratorio depicting the fourteen [[Stations of the Cross]], ''Via Crucis'',&lt;ref&gt;Falcon Valley Music Ed., Stefano Vagnini, ''Via Crucis'', Rome, Italy, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; composition for organ, computer, choir, string orchestra and brass quartet. ''Via Crucis'' represents Stefano Vagnini’s first intuition of the process of aggregations and the demonstration of the potential of the method. It is an [[oratorio]] made by ''continuous modules'' composed by the same musician in different moments.
* ''Originary Module - A: organ (two manuals and pedalboard)'' is the first module; it is divided into 14 movements, one for each station.
Being the original module, it may be presented to the public solo, for a total length of 50 minutes.
* ''Module - B: computer'' is to be overlapped to the stations I, II, IV, VIII, IX, XII and XIV with synchronism.
* ''Module - C:  4 voice choir'' is a four mixed voices choir for each station except the 5th.
The text is in latin from the Vulgata.
Even the internal module D structure is modular: the soprano part can be performed without the choir. The choir parts in the stations no. 3, 7 and 9 are overlapped in the 12th.
* ''Module - D: strings orchestra'' – The percussion (included in the score) is optional and can be considered a submodule of module E.
* ''Module E: brass quartet (two trumpets, horn and trombone)'' is the last module composed up to now and it can be added to the stations IV, V, VI, X, XI, XIII, XIV. 
* ''Module – F : video'' is a video by the photographer-producer Paolo del Bianco, not synchronized to the music.

===Zoo world modular project===
Zoo is a modular project made by independent modules created by worldwide composers over eight piano works by Stefano Vagnini. A typical characteristic of the project's performances is the lack of a stage and seating arrangements for the audience, who walk freely through the performance space (e.g. a garden, square, or shopping mall), while the musicians are stationed throughout the space and acoustically isolated such that their individual performances cannot all be heard at once. This means each audience member's experience of the performance is unique, depending on the path they take through the space and the precise moments they happen to be in proximity to each individual musician.
The Zoo world modular project currently comprises the following composers: Martin Vitous (Czech Rep.), George Christophy (Cypro), Anthony Green (U.S.A), Johannes Holik (Austria), Erik Schwartz (U.S.A), Heinz Chur  (Germany), [[Philip Wilcher]] (Australia), Ichinose Kyo (Japan), Julian Yu (China), John Sharply (Singapore), Slava Vinokur (Israel), Paul Gordon Manners (England), Giorgia Ragni (Italy).
The Zoo project has been performed since 2000:
* June 2002, Festival Villa e Castella, art director Nino Finauri&lt;ref&gt;Zoo,http://www.villecastella.it/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/VC_2002.pdf{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} depliant 2002, pp 11&lt;/ref&gt;
* May 2009, Sunny Isles Beach Miami (Florida, U.S.A),&lt;ref&gt;''The Miami Herald'', Thursday, 14 May 2009&lt;/ref&gt; in collaboration with Sunny Isles Beach government, Miami Art Charter School and the Arts ballet Theater of Florida.

===FaceBach===
The FaceBach project, organized by Strathclyde University Choir Director Alan Tavener,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.strathchamber.org/?page_id=165&lt;/ref&gt; was performed on 15 June 2012, at the Barony Hall Glasgow as closing workshop on Modular Music featuring the Strathclyde Barony Hall organ students and AiDADUO (Stefano Vagnini and Giorgia Ragni).
Some J. S. Bach organ music selection has been combined with contemporary music by [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]], [[Tan Dun]], [[Cathy Berberian]], [[John Cage]], [[Stefano Vagnini]] and Omega Zero.

==History==
===Fall of the People's Union===
{{Main|People's Union (Belgium)}}
The N-VA stems from the [[People's Union (Belgium)|People's Union]] ({{lang-nl|Volksunie}}, VU), a Belgian [[political party]] and broad electoral alliance of [[Flemish Movement|Flemish nationalists]]. Towards the end of the 20th century, with a steadily declining electorate and the majority of the party's [[federalism|federalist]] agenda implemented, friction between several wings of the People's Union emerged. In the beginning of the 1990s, [[Bert Anciaux]] became party president and led the party in an ever more [[Progressivism|progressive]] direction, combining the [[Social liberalism|social-liberal]] ideas of his new iD21-movement with the [[Regionalism (politics)|regionalist]] course of the People's Union. These experiments were opposed by the more traditional centre-right party base.

Tension rose towards the end of the decade, as [[Geert Bourgeois]], foreman{{Clarify|date=November 2015}} of the traditional and centre-right nationalist wing, was elected chairman by party members, in preference to the incumbent and progressive [[Patrik Vankrunkelsven]]. Factions subsequently clashed multiple times, over the future course of the party and possible support for current [[State reform in Belgium#2001: The fifth state reform|state reform negotiations]]. On 13 October 2001 the party openly split into three factions: the progressive wing around [[Bert Anciaux]], which would later become the [[Sociaal-Liberale Partij|Spirit]] party; the conservative nationalist wing around [[Geert Bourgeois]]; and a centrist group opposing the imminent split. A party referendum was held on the future of the party. The right wing gained a substantial plurality of 47% and inherited the party infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=New Parties in Old Party Systems|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YnLcAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA26|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-964606-7|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since no faction got an absolute majority, however, the name ''Volksunie'' could no longer be used.

===Foundation and the election threshold===
In the autumn of 2001, the New Flemish Alliance ({{lang-nl|Nieuw-Vlaamse Alliantie}}, N-VA) was founded. Seven members of parliament from the People's Union joined the new party. The new party council created a party [[manifesto]] and a statement of principles. The first party congress was held in May 2002, voting on a party program and permanent party structures. [[Geert Bourgeois]] was elected chairman.

The party participated in elections for the first time in the [[Belgian federal election, 2003|2003 federal elections]], but struggled with the [[election threshold]] of 5%. This threshold was only reached in [[West Flanders]], the constituency of [[Geert Bourgeois]]. With only one federal representative and no senator, the party lost government funding and faced irrelevance.

===Cartel with CD&amp;V===
In February 2004, the N-VA entered into an [[electoral alliance]], commonly known in Belgium as a [[Kartel (electoral alliance)|cartel]], with the [[Christian Democratic and Flemish]] (CD&amp;V) party, the traditionally largest party, which was then in opposition. They joined forces in the [[Belgian regional elections, 2004|regional elections in 2004]] and won. Both parties joined the new Flemish government, led by CD&amp;V leader [[Yves Leterme]]. [[Geert Bourgeois]] became a minister, and [[Bart De Wever]] became the new party leader in October 2004.

The cartel was briefly broken when the former right-wing liberal [[Jean-Marie Dedecker]] left the [[Open Vlaamse Liberalen en Democraten|Open Flemish Liberals and Democrats]] (Open VLD) and entered the N-VA on behalf of the party executive. However, the party congress did not put Dedecker on the election list, instead preferring to continue the cartel with CD&amp;V, who had strongly opposed placing him on a joint cartel list. Dedecker saw this as a vote of no confidence, and left the party after only 10 days, to form his own party, [[Libertair, Direct, Democratisch|List Dedecker]] (LDD). Deputy leader Brepoels, who supported Dedecker, stepped down from the party board afterwards.

In the Belgian federal election of 2007 the CD&amp;V/N-VA cartel won a major victory again, with a campaign focusing on good governance, state reform and the division of the electoral district [[Brussels-Halle-Vilvoorde]]. The N-VA won five seats in the [[Chamber of Representatives (Belgium)|Chamber of Representatives]] and two seats in the [[Senate (Belgium)|Senate]]. [[Yves Leterme]] initiated coalition talks, which repeatedly stalled (see [[2007–2008 Belgian government formation]]). On 20 March 2008, a new federal government was finally assembled. N-VA did not join this government, but gave its support pending state reform.

The cartel ended definitively on 24 September 2008, due to lack of progression in state reform matters and a different strategy on future negotiations. N-VA left the Flemish Government and gave up its support of Leterme at the federal level.

===Mainstream party===
In the [[Belgian regional elections, 2009|regional elections of June 2009]], N-VA  won an unexpected 13% of the votes, making them the winner of the elections, along with their old cartel partner CD&amp;V. N-VA subsequently joined the government, led by [[Kris Peeters]] (CD&amp;V). [[Bart De Wever]] chose to remain party leader and appointed [[Geert Bourgeois]] and [[Philippe Muyters]] as ministers in the [[Flemish Government]] and [[Jan Peumans]] as speaker of the [[Flemish Parliament]].

==Foundation and ideology==
The New Flemish Alliance is a relatively young political party, founded in the autumn of 2001. Being one of the successors of the Volksunie (1954–2001), it is, however, based on an established political tradition. The N-VA works towards the same goal as its predecessor: to redefine Flemish nationalism in a contemporary, pro-European setting. Party leader De Wever calls himself a conservative and a nationalist.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trouw.nl/achtergrond/deverdieping/article3035462.ece/_rsquo_Laat_Belgie_maar_rustig___verdampen_rsquo__.html Trouw: "Laat Belgie maar rustig verdampen"], last seen April 8th, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The N-VA argues for a Flemish republic, a member state of a democratic [[Federal Europe|European confederation]]. The party believes that the challenges of the 21st century can best be answered by strong communities and by well-developed international co-operation, a position which is reflected in their tagline: "Necessary in Flanders, useful in Europe." ({{lang-nl|Nodig in Vlaanderen, nuttig in Europa}}.)

A label for the political orientation of the N-VA is difficult to find as the party combines both left- and right-wing policies. According to its 2009 election programme for Flanders, the N-VA is [[Economic liberalism|economically liberal]] and [[Environmentalism|ecologically green]]. The N-VA supports [[public transport]], [[open source software]], [[renewable energy]] and taxing cars by the number of kilometres driven. It wants more aid for developing countries and more compulsory measures to require that immigrants learn Dutch.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

At European level, the N-VA is part of the [[European Free Alliance]] (EFA), a [[European political party]] consisting of [[Regionalism (politics)|regionalist]], pro-[[independence]] and [[Political parties of minorities|minority interest]] political parties, of which the [[People's Union (Belgium)|People's Union]] was a founder member. During the [[Seventh European Parliament|7th European Parliament]] of 2009–2014, the N-VA was a member of [[The Greens–European Free Alliance]] (Greens/EFA) group in the European Parliament. However, following the [[European Parliament election, 2014 (Belgium)|2014 European elections]], the N-VA moved to the [[European Conservatives and Reformists]] (ECR) group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.standaard.be/cnt/dmf20140618_01146790

==Electorate==
In the [[Belgian federal election, 2003|federal elections]] in 2003 N-VA received 3.1% of the votes, but won only one seat in the federal parliament. In February 2004 they formed an electoral alliance (cartel) with the [[Christian Democratic and Flemish]] party (CD&amp;V). The cartel won the elections for the Flemish Parliament. The N-VA received a total of 6 seats. However, on 21 September 2008 the N-VA lost its faith in the federal government and the following day minister [[Geert Bourgeois]] resigned. In a press conference he confirmed the end of the CD&amp;V/N-VA cartel.

In the [[European Parliament election, 2004 (Belgium)|2004 European elections]], N-VA had 1 MEP elected as part of the cartel with CD&amp;V.

In the 10 June 2007 [[Belgian federal election, 2007|federal elections]], the cartel won 30 out of 150 seats in the [[Chamber of Representatives (Belgium)|Chamber of Representatives]] and 9 out of 40 seats in the [[Senate (Belgium)|Senate]].

In the [[Belgian regional elections, 2009|regional elections of 11 June 2009]], N-VA (now on its own after the split of the cartel with [[Christian Democratic and Flemish|CD&amp;V]]) won an unexpected 13% of the votes, making them the winner of the elections along with their former cartel partner. In the [[European Parliament election, 2009 (Belgium)|2009 European elections]] held on the same day, the N-VA had one MEP elected.

In the [[Belgian federal election, 2010|2010 federal elections]], N-VA became the largest party of Flanders and of Belgium altogether.

In the [[Belgian federal election, 2014|2014 federal elections]], N-VA increased their dominant position, taking votes and seats from the far-right [[Flemish Interest]]. In the simultaneous [[Belgian regional elections, 2014|2014 regional elections]] and [[European Parliament election, 2014 (Belgium)|2014 European elections]], the N-VA also became the largest party in the [[Flemish Parliament]] and in the Belgian delegation to the [[European Parliament]].

The '''OVC project'''  (''Orphans and Vulnerable Children'') is an initiative of the ''Adigrat Diocesan Catholic Secretariat'' (ADCS) of the ''[[Ethiopian Catholic Eparchy of Adigrat]]''. The project supports young people with micro-[[scholarship]]s for obtaining a university entrance qualification and at least one [[bachelor's degree]] in their own country. It is based in [[Adigrat]], [[Tigray region]], Ethiopia. One of the sponsored students was the [[AIDS orphan]] Rahel Hailay,&lt;ref name="IWM-Rahel-Festschrift-Geschichte" /&gt; who completed the study of [[biology]] and [[zoology]] at the universities in [[Axum]] and [[Mek'ele]] from 2009 to 2014.&lt;ref name="IWM-Rahel-Festschrift-Rahel" /&gt; It is largely funded by donations collected by the [[Student Initiative Rahel]] in [[Germany]].&lt;ref name="IWM-Rahel-Festschrift-Finanzierung" /&gt;

== Student Initiative Rahel ==
{{main article|Student Initiative Rahel}}
Since 2010 additional finance aid is collected in [[Germany]] by the ''[[Student Initiative Rahel]]'' (SIR) to increase the possible number of scholarships given by the OVC project. The Student Initiative Rahel is a student project of the ''Institute for World Church and Mission'' (IWM) (German: ''Institut für Weltkirche und Mission'') which is a part of the [[Sankt Georgen Graduate School of Philosophy and Theology]] in [[Sachsenhausen (Frankfurt am Main)|Frankfurt-Sachsenhausen]]. The project is funded mainly by current and former students at the university.&lt;ref name="IWM-Rahel-Festschrift" /&gt;
Due to personnel fluctuation among students at the Sankt Georgen Graduate School of Philosophy and Theology, the project has been phasing out slowly since the end of 2017. The tasks of the support are gradually taken over by the ''Adigrat Diocesan Catholic Secretariat'' (ADCS) and former graduates in Ethiopia.&lt;ref name="IWM-Rahel-Letter" /&gt;

== Realisation ==

Both projects are connected through the support of the ''[[Pontifical Mission Societies]]'' (German: ''missio'') in all financial matters, such as account management, the administrative costs or the [[wire transfer|transfer]] of money to Ethiopia. In Ethiopia the ''Student Initiative Rahel'' is supervised locally by the ''Adigrat Diocesan Catholic Secretariat'' (ADCS) of the ''[[Ethiopian Catholic Eparchy of Adigrat]]'' under the patronage of the [[diocesan bishop]] Tesfay Medhin&lt;ref name="IWM-Rahel-Festschrift-Reise3" /&gt; within the framework of the ''OVC project'' (''Orphans and Vulnerable Children''). The ''OVC project'' is active in the areas of Adigrat and other areas particularly affected by [[poverty]]. The [[project manager]] of the ADCS Woldemariam Besirat selects the scholarship holders. The [[nonprofit organization]] supports in a [[scholarship]] youths – mostly young [[woman|women]] – in Adigrat in the north of Ethiopia, who are [[discrimination|disadvantaged]] for various reasons, and accompanies them financially and ideally&lt;ref name="IWM-Rahel-Festschrift" /&gt; during their studies at a university or their education. It is largely funded by donations.&lt;ref name="IWM-Rahel-Festschrift-Finanzierung" /&gt; and organizes religious education workshops on scholarship meetings with their own and external lecturers on topics such as [[AIDS]], the consequences of [[emigration]] as [[refugee]]s or on other [[medicine|medical]] or [[ethics|ethical]] issues. In addition to financial support, the promotion of [[autonomy|self-reliance]], [[self-confidence]] and [[self-esteem]], the promotion of self-responsibility, the awareness of [[social responsibility|responsibility]] and the ability to [[cooperation|work together]] are important aspects of the work of the OVC project.&lt;ref name="IWM-Rahel-Festschrift-Geschichte" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IWM-Rahel-Festschrift-missio" /&gt;

'''Porch sitting''', i.e., sitting on a [[porch|front porch]] or [[Urban stoop|stoop]], usually of a [[private residence]] is a [[leisure]] activity which can be a direct or indirect form of [[social interaction]]. This activity is a staple of most urban areas in the United States, and helps contribute to a lively atmosphere, for those sitting and also those passing by. This activity is most common during good weather, especially on warm summer nights and weekends.&lt;ref name=pittsburgh&gt;Pittsburgh Post-Gazette - Sep 4, 1974 [https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=L4BIAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=XW0DAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=porch-sitting%20air-conditioning&amp;pg=2072%2C408291 Front Porch Sitting in Pittsburgh]&lt;/ref&gt;

Porch sitting was once considered to be a status symbol.&lt;ref&gt;

It was formerly cooler out on the porch than it was inside the house, on hot summer days.  Air conditioning has thus replaced porch sitting, people able to socialize in the comfort of their homes, although porch sitting is still common in areas where the climate is nice.&lt;ref name=pittsburgh/&gt;

'''Role conflict''' occurs when there are incompatible demands placed upon a person such that compliance with both would be difficult.&lt;ref&gt;Katz, D., &amp; Kahn, R. L. (1978). The social psychology of organizations 2ed. New York City: John Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt; Persons experience role conflict when they find themselves pulled in various directions as they try to respond to the many statuses they hold.&lt;ref name="Gerber &amp; Macionis"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gerber |first1=Linda M. |last2=Macionis |first2=John J. |title=Sociology |date=2010 |publisher=Pearson Canada |isbn=978-0-13-800270-1 |page=129 |edition=7th Canadian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Role conflict can be something that can be for either a short period of time, or a long period of time, and it can also be connected to situational experiences.{{Explain|date=December 2017}}

Intra-role conflict occurs when the demands are within a single domain of life, such as on the job. An example would be when two superiors ask an employee to do a task, and both cannot be accomplished at the same time. Inter-role conflict occurs across domains of life. An example of inter-role conflict would be a husband and father who is also Chief of Police. If a tornado strikes the small town he is living in, the man has to decide if he should go home and be with his family and fulfill the role of being a good husband and father or remain and fulfill the duties of a "good" Chief of Police because the whole town needs his expertise."&lt;ref name=Peters&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/first/p/peters-mothers.html?_r=1 | work=The New York Times|title=When Mothers Work: Loving Our Children Without Sacrificing Our Selves|author=Peters, Joan K.|isbn= 0-201-12794-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conflict among the roles begins because of the human desire to reach success, and because of the pressure put on an individual by two imposing and incompatible demands competing against each other. The effects of role conflict, as found through case-studies and nationwide surveys, are related to individual personality characteristics and interpersonal relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kahn|first=R.L.|author2=Wolfe D.M. |author3=Quinn R.P. |author4=Snoek J.D. |author5=Rosenthal R.A. |title=Organizational stress: studies in role conflict and ambiguity|journal=APA PsycNET|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individual personality characteristic conflicts can arise within personality role conflict where "aspects of an individual's personality are in conflict with other aspects of that same individual's personality".&lt;ref name="Truett"/&gt; Interpersonal relations can cause conflict because they are by definition "having an association between two or more people that may range from fleeting to enduring, which can cause that conflict."

Example: "People in modern, high-income countries juggle many responsibilities demanded by their various statuses and roles.  As most mothers can testify both parenting and working outside the home are physically and emotionally draining.  Sociologists thus recognize role conflict as conflict among the roles corresponding to two or more statuses".&lt;ref name="Macionis"/&gt;{{rp|90}}

The discipline of [[group dynamics]] in psychology recognizes role conflict within a group setting.  Members of a group may feel that they are responsible for more than one role within this setting and that these roles may become disagreeable with each other.  When the expectations of two or more roles are incompatible, role conflict exists.  For example, a supervisor at a factory may feel strain due to his or her role as friend and mentor to the subordinate employees, while having to exhibit a stern and professional watchful eye over the employees.

==Work–family conflict==
A commonly noted role conflict is that between [[Work–family conflict|work and family]]. Researchers have noticed a [[Income and fertility#Paradox|declining fertility rate]] in developed countries. Some studies suggest that this drop may be because more women are pursuing careers and obtaining educations. The research is trying to show that women who have more trouble balancing their work life and family duties go on to have fewer additional children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hynes|first=K.M.|author2=Liu S. |title=Are difficulties in balancing work and family associated with subsequent fertility?|journal=Education Resources Information Center|year=2012|url=http://eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/search/recordDetails.jsp?ERICExtSearch_Descriptor=%22Role+Conflict%22&amp;_pageLabel=RecordDetails&amp;objectId=0900019b8049b6ad&amp;accno=EJ953811&amp;_nfls=false|accessdate=20 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
While some people believe that work–family role conflict only occurs for women, a 2008 study by the Families and Work Institute showed that 49% of employed males with families experienced work–family conflict. The study also showed that work flexibility is the number one concern for employed females with families and the number two or three issue for employed men with families. Flexibility in the workplace can be a huge relief to a person struggling to balance their career and home-life. Having that control is something that could change the relationship between work and family life to better be able to manage role conflict, and if more business participated in this action there could be a possible better outcome for all.&lt;ref name="Dell'Antonia"/&gt; Another study was done in France where the same common conflict of work and family life roles were interfering to an extreme. This study found that not even working from home was the solution, but to be able to come in late or leave early, on a flexible schedule is what was working best to be able to handle the role conflict.  Having this sort of flex schedule enables people to be able to work with their role conflicts and try to better be able to manage and cope with them. Again this study supports that if businesses do create this sort of flex schedule that this could be a definite possible solution.&lt;ref name="Dell'Antonia"/&gt;

Role conflict requirements for different roles might compete for a person's limited time, or could occur due to various strains associated with multiple roles. Some people can play one role and play it well while others can play multiple roles and also play them well. For example, we see a father as the provider and the protector while we see the women as the housewives, cooking and cleaning. If a man were to enter into the kitchen and proceed to cook, we might feel that he is acting inappropriately for his role and the same goes as if a woman was to do handy work in the household. This attitude is a root cause for the conflict many women feel when they become full-time workers and mothers. Women's rights have evolved greatly in the past forty years and women share most of the same rights as men. While women have stepped up to fill different roles, men have not stepped in to help balance out the work load. Modern day mothers are expected to be able have the career capacity of a man and the domestic grace modeled after the ideal mother/wife of the 1950s. Realistically, women have a hard time balancing the two. Many women feel that they are forced to choose between career and family, then are made to feel guilty about their choice by society.&lt;ref name=Peters/&gt;

==Social factors among low-income adults==
When one has multiple role responsibilities, duties or demands from education, job or family relationships, it can be hard to manage. Additionally, the responsibilities are manageable while other times it can be hard to manage especially when one is living in a low income household.

==Homeless men and gender==

[[Homelessness]] is a situation that takes a heavy toll on anyone, especially men with children or dependents. Traditional gender roles describe men as being the providers. Homeless men are often unemployed thus lack the means to provide the resources that their family needs. This can cause high levels of distress in men. Homeless men may also become the sole caregiver of their children during homelessness. This can lead to high stress levels in men because they are expected to take on the role of both provider and nurturer. The transition can be very overwhelming.&lt;ref&gt;https://pantherfile.uwm.edu/margo/public/984/Fall2009/articles/HomelessDuncan.pdf{{dead link|date=March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In prisons==
[[Prison]]s are filled predominantly with male inmates. This may be due to the dominant construction of masculinity, which inclines males to criminality and violence. Dominant masculinity is symbolized by control, independence, heterosexuality, aggressiveness, authority, and a capacity for violence in American culture. When a male finds themselves lacking in one of these areas they may be driven to make up for it in another area; such as when a poor, jobless young man tries to show masculinity by carrying a gun or wearing gang related clothing. When one is in prison, many of the resources use to assert masculinity are not readily available, thus men seek other ways to proclaim their masculinity. Many inmates find in imperative to put on a mask of hyper-masculinity, which may conflict with their normal personality, in order to maintain their status within the prison. This expectation to maintain a certain idea of masculinity "contradict[s] basic human needs and desires for intimacy and emotional expression, creating stress and conflict between men's core selves and social expectations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Karp, David R.|url=http://www.skidmore.edu/~dkarp/Karp%20Vitae_files/Unlocking_Masculinities.pdf|title=Unlocking Men, Unmasking Masculinities: Doing Men's Work in Prison|journal=The Journal of Men's Studies|volume=18|number=1|pages=63–83|year=2010|access-date=2012-04-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304032445/http://www.skidmore.edu/~dkarp/Karp%20Vitae_files/Unlocking_Masculinities.pdf|archive-date=2016-03-04|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Role conflict is seen not only in the inmates of the prison, but also the prison personnel. There are two types of prisons: custody prisons and treatment prisons. The main goal of a custody prison is to protect the community by maintaining control over the inmates. The correctional officers are expected to maintain order, enforce rules, and keep custody. A key rule to their job is that interaction between inmates and officers is to remain distant. The main goal of a treatment prison is to protect the community by rehabilitating the inmate. The Officers are expected to respond to inmates in a therapeutic manner and develop ties with the inmates. Currently prisons are combining the two types of custody and the staff is experiencing role conflict. Officers are being asked to do conflicting jobs such as remain socially distant while also building close, supportive relationships with inmates. This emphasis on the combination of custody and treatment often results in two distinguished, mutually antagonistic groups of staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Hepburn, J. R.; Albonetti, C.|title=Role Conflict in Correctional Institutions: An Empirical Examination of the Treatment-Custody Dilemma Among Correctional Staff|url=http://www.jwalkonline.org/docs/Grad%20Classes/Survey/articles/psyclimate/not%20used/role%20conflict%20in%20correctional.pdf|journal=Criminology|volume=17|issue=4|pages=445–460|year=1980|doi=10.1111/j.1745-9125.1980.tb01308.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role clarity and role ambiguity==
One of the main causes of role conflict is role ambiguity, which is the lack of certainty in what a certain role in an organization requires. This can be the result or poor communication of job duties or unclear instructions from a supervisor. This can lead to role conflict when there are contradicting ideas as to what tasks are supposed to be accomplished. Team members can then be uncertain of their role and their teammate’s roles to the team and team objectives begin to conflict with one another.

The solution to this problem and role conflict as a whole can come from role clarity. As its name suggests, role clarity is clearly defining roles and objectives so as to reduce role conflict and role ambiguity. To do this, employers need to clearly communicate with employees as to the goals of a project. Also, employees should be fully aware of their role in the group and their responsibilities. It is helpful if one develops and maintains a working environment where workers have communication and if needed, feedback can be provided. Encouragement is another form of clarity. If one has a question or is not clear about a specific role that has been given to them, workers can communicate. Make sure the person understands their roles and duties to avoid any mistakes that can occur, and ensure that workers have an up-to-date role so they can manage their roles accordingly.

==Within a workplace==
Working with groups – especially in a work or committee setting – can sometimes result in role conflict if an individual feels that his or her roles are in opposition.  These roles may be in conflict for many reasons.  For example, the role taker may misunderstand the role sender's prescribed tasks or the miscommunication can occur the other way, as well.  If a role taker is seemingly enthusiastic about taking on many tasks within various roles, this may be communicated to the role sender and he or she may be given conflicting role requirements.  Role conflict can pair with role ambiguity – a situation in which the expectations of a role are ill-defined – to create role stress, which is detrimental to workplace performance.  Role stress has also been linked to decreased job satisfaction and employee turnover.&lt;ref&gt;Kemery, [[Arthur G. Bedeian|Bedeian]], Mossholder &amp; Touliatos, 1985&lt;/ref&gt;

To avoid role conflict within a work place, managers should outline specifically the duties required by an employee to avoid any miscommunication or confusion.  Feedback should also be provided to employees, as this explicitly illustrates if the role-taker is properly performing the role requirements and can assist the role-taker if there are any concerns.  Steps should be taken to avoid the crossover of potentially conflicting roles and if two or more roles are required of an employee, these roles should be separated by time and place if possible.

==Work performance==
{{Main|Job performance}}
Role conflict can have many different effects on the work-life of an individual as well as their family-life. In a study in Taiwan, it was found that those suffering from role conflict also suffered greatly in their work performance, mainly in the form of lack of [[motivation]]. Those with role conflict did not do more than the bare minimum requirements at work. There was also a decline in the ability to assign tasks. Having multiple roles will often lead to job dissatisfaction. 

Experiencing role conflict within the work place may also lead to [[workplace bullying]]. When companies undergo organizational change workers often experience either a loss or a gain in areas of a workers job, thus changing the expectations of the worker. Change is often very [[Occupational stress|stressful]] for workers. Workers who might have lost a degree of power may feel like they lost their authority and begin to lash out at other employees by being verbally abusive, purposefully withholding work related items, or sometimes even physically to withhold their status.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Dombeck, Ph.D. (July 24, 2007) [https://www.mentalhelp.net/articles/the-long-term-effects-of-bullying/ 
The Long Term Effects Of Bullying] Retrieved 6 June 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inter-role==
Interpersonal role conflict occurs when the source of the dilemma stems from occupancy of more than one focal position. For example, as a husband and a father in a social system a superintendent may think his wife and children expect him to spend most of his evenings with them. However, his school board and P.T.A. groups, he may feel, expect him (as their school superintendent) to spend most of his after-office hours on educational and civic activities. The superintendent usually cannot satisfy both of these incompatible expectations.&lt;ref name=Mackey&gt;{{cite thesis|author=Mackey, B. A.|year=1977|title=Application of role conflict theory to the role expectations held for the dean of students by various reference groups|type=Doctoral dissertation|publisher=University of Florida|url=https://archive.org/stream/applicationofrol00mack}}.

==Intra-role==
Intra-personal role conflict occurs when an individual in one role believes that others have many different expectations for him/her in regards to that role. "The school superintendent, for example, may feel that the teachers expect him to be their spokesperson and leader, to take their side on such matters as salary increases and institutional policy. However, the superintendent may feel that the school board members expect him to represent them, to "sell" their views to the staff because he is the executive officer and the administrator of school board policies".&lt;ref name=Mackey/&gt;

==Coping==
"Inter-role conflict results from competing sets of expectations that are aroused by organizational, interpersonal, and personal conflicts"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Mertensmeyer, C., &amp; Coleman, M.|year=1987|title=Correlates of inter-role conflict in young rural and urban parents |edition=4 |volume= 36|pages=425–429|journal=Family Relations|location=Minneapolis|publisher=National Council of Family Relations|doi=10.2307/584495|jstor=584495}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following strategies assist in modifying and managing these areas.

One response to role conflict is deciding that something has to go. More than one politician, for example, has decided not to run for office because of the conflicting demands of a hectic campaign schedule and family life. In other cases, people put off having children in order to stay on the fast track for career success.&lt;ref&gt;John Macionis, Gerber,  John, Linda (2010). Sociology 7th Canadian Ed. Toronto, Ontario: Pearson Canada Inc. pp. 129.&lt;/ref&gt;
Even the roles linked to a single status can make competing demands on us. A plant supervisor may enjoy being friendly with workers. At the same time, distance is necessary to evaluate his staff.&lt;ref name="Macionis"/&gt;{{rp|90}}

An individual can alter external, structurally imposed expectations held by others, regarding the appropriate behavior of a person in his or her position.&lt;ref name="Hall"&gt;{{cite journal|ref=harv|last=Hall|first=D. T.|year=1972|title=A model of coping with role conflict: The role behavior of college educated women|journal=Administrative Science Quarterly|volume=17|issue=04|pages=471–486|jstor=2393827|doi=10.2307/2393827}}{{subscription needed}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The most effective alteration is change in the workplace. If the job is a "family-friendly" environment, the needs of a parent may be met easier. One of the biggest stress-relievers for working parents is [[paid time off]] including family sick days. A parent may feel trapped if he or she needs to stay home with their child but knows that missing a day of work will, in return, dock them a day of pay. If they have a few days of paid leave they will be able to take care of their child and not have to worry about losing money for doing so. 
Another workplace support of work-family conflict is child-care. Some jobs have a daycare facility on site or nearby, assisting parents in knowing their children are well taken care of while they are working.  The latter example distributes role expectations to others in order to alleviate role conflict.

"Another approach involves changing one's attitude toward and perceptions of one's role expectations, as opposed to changing the expectations themselves. An example is setting priorities among and within roles, being sure that certain demands are always met (for example, the needs of sick children), while others have lower priority (such as dusting furniture)."&lt;ref name="Hall"/&gt;

[[File:Schueberfouer Luxembourg.jpg|thumb|Schueberfouer funfair in Luxembourg, 2016]]
[[File:Schueberfouer.jpg|thumb|upright|The Ferris Wheel.]]

The '''Schueberfouer''' is the annual [[Luxembourg city]] funfair held on the ''Glacis'' square in the city district of [[Limpertsberg]].

The 677th edition of the largest amusement park in the wider region beyond national borders will start on 23 August 2017 and ends on 11 September 2017.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.wort.lu/en/luxembourg/glacis-everything-you-need-to-know-about-this-year-s-schueberfouer-59959837a5e74263e13c5dd0&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, the Schueberfouer starts on Wednesday, Thursday or Friday before Saint Bartholomew's day (24 August) and closes on Monday, Tuesday or Wednesday before 12 September in order to last 20 days every year. In 2010, the fair comprised 184 attractions including 27 major rides, 13 children's rides and 54 restaurants and snacks bars.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fouer.lu/en/Attractions.html "Attractions"], Schueberfouer. Retrieved 1 October 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, the fair attracted over 2 million visitors.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

==History==
John I of Luxembourg, better known as [[John of Bohemia|John the Blind]], King of Bohemia and Count of Luxembourg, founded the Schueberfouer on 20 October 1340.&lt;ref&gt;{{book|last=Margue|first=Paul|title=Luxemburg in Mittelalter und Neuzeit|publisher=Editions Bourg-Bourger|date=1974}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The founding document stated: It will begin on the eve of the feast of [[Bartholomew the Apostle|St Bartholomew]] and will last for a full eight days.

Even today, it remains linked to St Bartholomew's day, 24 August, the traditional opening date.
 
The name ''Schueberfouer'' is thought to originate probably from the name of the market place where it was first held: the ''Schuedbuerg'', today's "Plateau du St Esprit" (in English: Holy Spirit Plateau; in Luxembourgish: Helleggeescht-Plateau), which serves nowadays as residential location for the highest courts of justice of Luxembourg. 
("Fouer" is the Luxembourgish word for "fair".)

Another unconfirmed theory links the term "Schueber" to the old German word "Schober" (in English: barn), which would refer to the initial agricultural role of the fair. Indeed, for almost 450 years, the fair was mainly a large and regionally very important market for everything from agricultural products and livestock to cloth, pottery and other household items.

After the [[Limpertsberg]] wood had been removed to improve the defensive capabilities of the city, the fair moved in 1610 to the Glacis, a huge open space beyond the westward fortifications of Luxembourg City which were destroyed after 1867 and replaced by the City Park.

During the 18th century, shows and games became part of the fair but it was not until the early 20th century that a Ferris wheel and a rollercoaster first appeared.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fouer.lu/en/History.html "History"], Schueberfouer. Retrieved 1 October 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Slaka''' is the imaginary East European [[COMECON]] country featured in two books of the English novelist [[Malcolm Bradbury]] (1932–2000), ''Rates of Exchange'' (1983) and ''Why Come to Slaka?'' (1986).  It is described by its leader Comrade-General I. Vulcani as "a nation proud of its socialistik emulations."&lt;ref&gt;Bradbury (1986), 9.&lt;/ref&gt; The first novel relates the misadventures of a visiting British academic, the second is a [[pastiche]] [[guide book]] to the country. Slaka is also the name of the country's capital; another of the country's major towns is Glit.&lt;ref&gt;Bradbury (1986), 67.&lt;/ref&gt;  The country's language is known as Slakan. The country's national opera is ''[[Vedontakal Vrop]]'', by the composer Z. Leblat.

Slaka was further explored in television, in two mini-series scripted by Bradbury, ''The Gravy Train'', and a sequel ''The Gravy Train Goes East''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2000/nov/28/guardianobituaries.education|title=Obituary: Sir Malcolm Bradbury|first=Harriet|last=Harvey-Wood|date=28 November 2000|publisher=|via=www.theguardian.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics have proposed Slaka to be a satire of [[Romania]] during the 1980s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bucharestlife.net/2010/04/27/great-books-in-english-about-romania-no-2-rates-of-exchange-by-malcolm-bradbury/#sthash.fo6DdZ3N.dpbs | title=Great Books in English about Romania No. 2: Rates of Exchange, by Malcolm Bradbury | date=April 27, 2010 | author=Craig Turp|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100429195146/http://www.bucharestlife.net/2010/04/27/great-books-in-english-about-romania-no-2-rates-of-exchange-by-malcolm-bradbury/|archivedate=2010-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; or possibly [[Bulgaria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lidiavianu.scriptmania.com/malcolm_bradbury.htm|title=Malcolm Bradbury|website=lidiavianu.scriptmania.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''strapless dress''' or top is a garment that stays put around the upper body without [[shoulder strap]]s or other visible means of support. It is usually supported by an internal [[corset]] and/or [[brassiere]], with the tightness of the bodice preventing the dress from slipping out of position.&lt;ref name=met&gt;{{cite book|last=Martin|first=Richard|title=Bare witness|year=1996|publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art|location=New York|isbn=9780870998027|pages=6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PmuEqgZPdeUC&amp;pg=PA6#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|author2=Koda, Harold }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Libby-Holman-1930.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Actress [[Libby Holman]] in an early strapless dress (1930)]]

===1930s to 1980s===
According to [[Richard Martin (curator)|Richard Martin]] and [[Harold Koda]], the modern strapless dress first appeared in the 1930s, where it was popularised by designers such as [[Mainbocher]], and, from the late 1940s, [[Christian Dior]].&lt;ref name=met/&gt; The July 18, 1938, issue of ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' claimed that the "absolutely strapless, sleeveless evening dress" was a 1937–38 invention.&lt;ref name=life&gt;{{cite journal|title=Underthings for the Strapless Vogue|journal=LIFE|date=18 July 1938|pages=33|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nU8EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA33#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=18 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, that was predated in 1930 by the actress [[Libby Holman]], who had been photographed in an apparently strapless dress that year.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite magazine |last= |first= |date=May 1930 |title=The Lure of Libby Holman |url=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/archive/8/8b/20160929232743%21Libby-Holman-1930.jpg |magazine=Theatre Magazine |page=57  |access-date=2016-09-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Holman became associated with the strapless dress and is regularly credited with inventing it,&lt;ref&gt;Scheper, Jeanne.

[[File:Rita Hayworth as Gilda performing "Put The Blame On Mame" in the trailer for the film Gilda.jpg|thumb|250px|Rita Hayworth in ''Gilda'' (1946)]]

Strapless dresses remained popular after the Second World War, with the style sometimes being described as the "naked look".&lt;ref name=palmer&gt;{{cite book|last=Palmer|first=Alexandra|title=Couture &amp; commerce : the transatlantic fashion trade in the 1950s|year=2001|publisher=UBC Press [u.a.] |location=Vancouver |isbn=9780774808262 |pages=154 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eeGDr5ZzCsEC&amp;pg=PA154&amp;dq#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most famous strapless dresses of this period was the [[Black dress of Rita Hayworth|black satin gown]] worn by [[Rita Hayworth]] for a song and dance routine in ''[[Gilda]]''.&lt;ref name=hal&gt;{{cite book|last=Rubenstein|first=Hal|title=100 unforgettable dresses|year=2012|publisher=Harper Design|location=New York|isbn=9780062198884|pages=206–207|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KvzSrWl5QP0C&amp;pg=PT206#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hayworth's performance demonstrated to viewers that strapless dresses could be secure enough to move around and dance in without risk of indecent exposure.&lt;ref name=hal/&gt; Despite this, more conservative customers might add shoulder straps to their new strapless dresses.&lt;ref name=palmer/&gt; The style was also problematic for those who objected to its perceived immodesty. During the 1940s and 1950s, Catholic campaigners in the United States protested against "immodest" clothing, including [[Bikini|two-piece]] and strapless swimsuits and dresses.&lt;ref name=jay&gt;{{cite book|last=Jay|first=Kathryn|title="In Vogue with Mary" - How Catholic Girls Created an Urban Market for Modesty; published in Faith in the market : religion and the rise of urban commercial culture|year=2002|publisher=Rutgers University Press|location=New Brunswick, N.J.|isbn=9780813530994 |pages=177–198 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=niIAHkP89JgC&amp;pg=PA177#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |author2=Winston, Diane |editor=John M.

During the 1950s, notable strapless dress designers included [[Grès|Madame Grès]], whose flowing Grecian dresses were mounted upon custom-designed interior corsets by [[Alice Cadolle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Polan|first=Brenda|title=The Great Fashion Designers.|year=2009|publisher=Berg|location=Oxford|isbn=9781847882271|pages=69|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H5oadQtleT4C&amp;pg=PA69#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|edition=English|author2=Tredre, Roger }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s, [[Halston]] designed an unstructured strapless dress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Polan|first=Brenda|title=The Great Fashion Designers.|year=2009|publisher=Berg|location=Oxford|isbn=9781847882271|pages=139|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H5oadQtleT4C&amp;pg=PA139&amp;dq=#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|edition=English|author2=Tredre, Roger }}&lt;/ref&gt; The knitted [[tube top]] was worn as a casual strapless option,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Peterson|first=Amy T.|title=Greenwood Encyclopedia of Clothing through American History , 1900 to the Present|year=2008|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=0313043345|pages=209|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rQCEF-tG77AC&amp;pg=RA1-PA209#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|author2=Ann Kellogg }}&lt;/ref&gt; and by the 1980s, strapless dresses were made in stretchy, elastic fabrics which did not require boning or interior structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Steele|first=edited by Valerie|title=The Berg companion to fashion|year=2010|publisher=Berg|location=Oxford|isbn=9781847885920|pages=266|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Hemsvn9ZbRkC&amp;pg=PA266#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1990s onwards===
[[File:Himeji-Oshiro-Matsuri 2010 087.JPG|thumb|200px|Japanese bride wearing a strapless dress, 2010]]
In 2012, the strapless dress was described as the most widely requested style for Western wedding dresses.&lt;ref name=maggie&gt;{{cite book |last=Daniels |first=Maggie |title=Wedding Planning and Management |year=2012 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=9781136349140 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i6bVaaeNopEC&amp;pg=PT256&amp;dq#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|author2=Carol Loveless }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vera Wang]] is sometimes credited with introducing this style of bridal dress in the first decade of the 21st century,&lt;ref name=maggie/&gt; although strapless dresses were an increasingly valid option from the 1990s onwards with the growing popularity of formal [[civil wedding]]s from the 1990s.&lt;ref name=clancy&gt;{{cite book|last=Steer|first=Deirdre Clancy|title=The 1980s and 1990s|year=2009|publisher=Chelsea House|location=New York|isbn=9781604133868|pages=47–48|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cgU5OQuHTRcC&amp;pg=PA47&amp;dq#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=woram&gt;{{cite book|last=Woram|first=Catherine|title=Wedding dress style : the indispensable style-file for brides-to-be and designers |year=1993 |publisher=Apple |location=London |isbn=9781850764632 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wtDfAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=strapless#search_anchor}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, for religious weddings, strapless and shoulder-baring styles are potentially controversial,&lt;ref name=clancy/&gt; and despite the popularity of the strapless wedding dress it is considered by some to be a "rejection of the virginal ideal".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kohl|first=Martha|title=I do : a cultural history of Montana weddings |year=2011 |publisher=Montana Historical Society Press |location=Helena |isbn=9780980129229 |pages=74 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Lq2HGZvRcrgC&amp;pg=PA74&amp;dq#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The strapless dress is also a very popular style for [[red carpet fashion]].&lt;ref name=hal/&gt;

==Social and cultural context==
Since their introduction, strapless garments have proved problematic in many contexts. In the early 21st century, many schools and workplaces specifically forbid strapless garments as part of their [[dress code]]. An [[Adecco]] survey published in ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' in 2012 indicated that 72% of Americans thought strapless tops were inappropriate office wear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kom|first=Melissa|title=What Not to Wear To Work|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/atwork/2012/07/20/work-wear-101-what-not-to-wear-to-work/|accessdate=18 March 2013|newspaper=The Wall Street Journal|date=20 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religious stances===
Strapless garments may be singled out for particular censure by preachers and clerics. In 2005, a Muslim cleric declared strapless garments "satanic", along with other revealing garments such as [[miniskirt]]s and [[see-through clothing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Devine|first=Miranda|title=Muslim cleric: women incite men's lust with 'satanic dress'|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/National/Muslim-cleric-women-incite-mens-lust-with-satanic-dress/2005/04/23/1114152362381.html|accessdate=18 March 2013|newspaper=The Sun-Herald|date=24 April 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Spencer W. Kimball]], the 12th [[President of the Church (LDS Church)|President]] of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS church), declared that strapless gowns were neither righteous nor approved, and that no Latter-day Saint woman should wear one at any time,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kimball|first=Spencer W.|title=The Teachings of Spencer W.

A '''tembel hat''' ([[Hebrew]]: kova tembel, '''כובע טמבל''') is a [[hat]] which is an [[the state of Israel|Israeli]] national symbol. The tembel hat was commonly worn by [[Jews]] in [[Israel]] from the beginning of the 20th century until the 1970s. In Israeli [[cartoon]]s it is still used to symbolize the typical Israeli (e.g., the cartoon character [[Srulik]]). 
==Etymology==
In Hebrew slang, tembel means silly, or fool.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrg.co.il/online/1/ART1/969/219.html ארנס: לא כל טמבל יכול להיות שר ביטחון, שמעון איפרגן, מעריב, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; It is not known whether the slang term was named after the hat or the hat after the slang term. There is a theory that the tembel hat was originally the heavy-duty hat of the [[Templers (religious believers)|Templers Christian movement]] that was active in Palestine at the end of the 19th century and in the beginning of the 20th century. By this theory the hat's first name was "Templers' hat," but it was changed to "tembel hat" by the [[Arab]]s who could not pronounce the P and the correct vowels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

However, it is more likely that the name "tembel hat" derives from the [[Turkish language|Turkish]] or [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman]] word "tembel" which means lazy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The Tembel's shape is the same as the [[Pileus (hat)|pileus]], the hat adopted by freed slaves in Greek and Roman antiquity and adopted as a symbol of freedom at the time of the French Revolution. The ancient pileus survived in [[Albania]] in the early 20th century and may have influenced the leaders of the 2nd [[Aliyah]] who adopted the hat.

'''''The Interpreter''''' (2003) is [[Suki Kim]]’s first novel. In ''The Interpreter'', Kim creates a twenty-nine-year-old [[Korean American]] court interpreter named Suzy Park who makes a startling and ominous discovery during one court case which ultimately reveals the mystery of her parents' homicide. The award winning novel, mainly a murder mystery, breaks through the stereotypical images of the happy immigrant experience with a story of pain, loss, and murder.

==Plot summary==
Suzy Park is a young, attractive, and achingly alone Korean American woman who works as a [[legal translation|court interpreter]] for the [[New York City Courts|New York City court system]]. She has had two rocky relationships with married men, worked a series of unsatisfying jobs, and cut ties with her family before her parents were shot dead in an unsolved double murder. The life she has chosen as an interpreter is a reflection of Suzy's searching for her own identity and trying to bridge the two cultures to both of which she feels a detachment. During one court case she discovers that her parents were not murdered by random violence, as the police had indicated, but instead had been shot by political enemies. The discovery provides the glint of a new lead for Park, and the novel tracks her investigation into what really happened, which ultimately reveals the mystery of her parents' homicide.

The '''United Tribes of New Zealand''' ({{lang-mi|'''Te W(h)akaminenga o Nga Rangatiratanga o Nga Hapu o Nu Tireni'''|lit=}}) was a confederation of [[Iwi|Māori tribes]] based in the north of the [[North Island]]. 

== History ==
{{main|Declaration of the Independence of New Zealand}}
The confederation was convened in 1834 by British Resident [[James Busby]]. Busby had been sent to New Zealand in 1833 by the [[Colonial Office]] to serve as the official British Resident, and was anxious to set up a framework for trade between [[Māori people |Māori]] and Europeans. The Māori chiefs of the northern part of the North Island agreed to meet with him in March 1834. Rumours began spreading that the Frenchman Baron [[Charles de Thierry]] planned to set up an independent state at [[Hokianga]]. The United Tribes declared their independence on 28 October 1835 with the signing of the [[Declaration of the Independence of New Zealand|Declaration of Independence]].&lt;ref name="historical_atlas"&gt;{{cite book |title=New Zealand Historical Atlas |page="Te Whenua Rangatira", plate 36}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1836, the British Crown under [[King William IV]] recognized the United Tribes and its flag. Busby's efforts were entirely too successful: as the islands settled down, the British began to consider an outright annexation.

By 1839, the Declaration of the United Tribes had 52 signatories from Northland and a few signatories from other parts, notably from the [[ariki]] of the [[Waikato Tainui]], [[Pōtatau Te Wherowhero]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Treaty events 1800-49 - Treaty timeline |url= http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/politics/treaty/treaty-timeline/treaty-events-1800-1849 |work=New Zealand History online | publisher =Ministry for Culture and Heritage |accessdate= 6 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1840, a number of chiefs of the United Tribes convened at Waitangi to sign the [[Treaty of Waitangi]].&lt;ref name="MKing"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Penguin History of New Zealand|last=King|first=Michael|publisher=Penguin Books|year=2003|isbn=0-14-301867-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Musket Wars]] (1807{{dash}}1842), [[Ngāpuhi]] and other tribes raided and occupied many parts of the North Island, but eventually reverted to their previous territorial status as other tribes acquired European weapons.

From a New Zealand standpoint under the settler government, the Confederation has been considered to have been assimilated into a new entity after the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi;  the Declaration is viewed in large part as merely a historical document.&lt;ref name = "historical_atlas" /&gt; In recent times, questions have arisen regarding the constitutional relevance of the Declaration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Declaration of Independence – background to the Treaty|url=http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/politics/treaty/background-to-the-treaty/declaration-of-independence|work=The Declaration of Independence|publisher=New Zealand History online|accessdate=6 September 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811225106/http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/politics/treaty/background-to-the-treaty/declaration-of-independence|archive-date=11 August 2011|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern developments==
As of October 2010, the [[Waitangi Tribunal]] began investigating the claim by Ngāpuhi that their sovereignty was not ceded in their signing of the Treaty of Waitangi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Field |first=Michael |title=Hearing starts into Ngāpuhi's claims |url= http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/3674280/Hearing-starts-into-Ngapuhis-claims |work=Stuff |publisher=Fairfax New Zealand |accessdate=6 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Tribunal, in ''Te Paparahi o te Raki'' inquiry (Wai 1040)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.waitangi-tribunal.govt.nz/inquiries/genericinquiries/northland/ |title=Te Paparahi o Te Raki (Northland) inquiry, Waitangi Tribunal |access-date=1 November 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111011145131/http://www.waitangi-tribunal.govt.nz/inquiries/genericinquiries/northland/ |archive-date=11 October 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; is in the process of considering the Māori and Crown understandings of He Whakaputanga o te Rangatiratanga / The Declaration of Independence 1835 and Te Tiriti o Waitangi / the Treaty of Waitangi 1840. 

Many of the arguments being used are outlined in [[Paul Moon]]'s 2002 book ''Te Ara Ki Te Tiriti: The Path to the Treaty of Waitangi'', which argued that not only did the Maori signatories have no intention of transferring sovereignty, but that at the time the British government and James Busby did not wish to acquire it and that the developments and justifications leading to the present state were later developments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Book lies at the heart of Ngāpuhi’s sovereignty |url=http://www.nznewsuk.co.uk/living/?id=8088 |work=NZNewsUK |publisher=Sky News New Zealand |accessdate=6 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that the hearings will last between four and six years, and may serve a serious precedent for all Maori tribal groups if the Tribunal recognizes Ngāpuhi sovereignty. A common Ngāpuhi interpretation of the Declaration of the United Tribes is that the British government was simply recognizing Māori independence and putting the world on check, merely re-asserting sovereignty that had existed from "time immemorial".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Joshua Hitchcock sets the record straight regarding Ngapuhi, sovereignty, and legal pluralism in New Zealand |url= http://settlercolonialstudies.org/2010/08/03/joshua-hitchcock-sets-the-record-straight-regarding-ngapuhi-sovereignty-and-legal-pluralism-in-new-zealand/ |work=Settler Colonial Studies Blog |date=3 August 2010 |accessdate=6 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Update Nov 14, 2014.{{cite web|url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/63196127/M%C4%81ori-did-not-give-up-sovereignty-Waitangi-Tribunal | title=Ngapuhi did not cede sovereignty |publisher=Stuff News}}

The idea of a flag to represent New Zealand first arose when the New Zealand-built trading ship ''Sir George Murray'' was seized in Sydney for sailing without a flag or register in 1830. British navigation laws applied in Australia and ruled that every ship must carry an official certificate that included the nationality of the ship. New Zealand was not yet a British colony, so could not sail under a British flag or register. With no flag to represent the islands, trading ships and their cargoes could be confiscated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.mch.govt.nz/nz-identity-heritage/flags/united-tribes-flag |title=United Tribes flag |date=28 June 2012 |publisher=Ministry for Culture and Heritage |accessdate=16 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; While a temporary licence was granted for the ''Sir George Murray'' by New South Wales authorities, it was clear that a more permanent solution was needed. Busby was approached by Maori chiefs in 1833 about the matter of a flag. Busby asked Reverend Williams and the Colonial Secretary [[Richard Bourke]] in New South Wales for assistance, and, with additional consultation with tribal leaders, three designs were drawn up. 

On 20 March 1834, three designs were put to 25 northern Maori chiefs at Waitangi by James Busby and Captain Lambert of the man-of-war [[HMS Alligator (1821)|HMS ''Alligator'']]. By a vote of 12-10-3, the design now widely known as the United Tribes Flag was chosen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/politics/flags-of-new-zealand/united-tribes-flag |title= United Tribes flag |work=NZHistory |publisher= Ministry of Culture and Heritage |accessdate= 15 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; British, American, and French representatives witnessed the ceremony, which included a 21-gun salute from the ''Alligator''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.united-tribes.com/history.htm "History"], united-tribes.com. Retrieved 7 February 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The flag was based in part on the [[Saint George's Cross|St George's Cross]] that was already used by the [[New Zealand Church Missionary Society|Church Missionary Society]], with a [[canton (heraldry)|canton]] featuring a smaller red cross on a blue background [[fimbriation|fimbriated]] in black, and with a white eight-pointed star in each quarter of the canton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Flags - New Zealand flag |first=Kerryn |last=Pollock |url= http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/flags/page-1 |encyclopedia=Te Ara – the Encyclopedia of New Zealand |date=13 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; When officially gazetted in New South Wales in August 1835, the description did not mention the fimbriation or the number of points on the stars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.oocities.org/gwlkingsley/maori/designs.html |title=Te Hakituatahi ō Aotearoa (The First Flag of New Zealand) |first=Gavin |last=Kingsley |date=2000 |accessdate=15 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The description was: "A red St. George's Cross on a white ground. In the first quarter, a red St. George's Cross on a blue ground, pierced with four white stars."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=New Zealand |first=Alex. |last=M'Leay |authorlink=Alexander Macleay |url= http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-page4251971 |newspaper=The Australian |date=25 August 1835 |page=4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This version of the flag served as the ''de facto'' national flag of New Zealand from 1835 until the signing of the [[Treaty of Waitangi]] in February 1840.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/nz_hist3.html |title=New Zealand - Flag of the United Tribes (1835-1840) |first= |last= |date= |work=Flags of the World |publisher= |accessdate= 15 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The version of the flag with black fimbriation and eight-pointed stars is widely used today as a flag by Māori groups throughout New Zealand, who also refer to it as the '''He Whakaputanga flag'''. 

The flag features on the medals presented to soldiers who served in the [[Second Boer War|South African War]] (1899–1902).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/media/photo/south-african-war-medal|title=South African War medal|date=18 August 2014 |accessdate=15 February 2015 |work=NZHistory |publisher=[[Ministry for Culture and Heritage (New Zealand)|Ministry for Culture and Heritage]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2009 it was proposed as one of four possible designs for an official Māori flag at a series of [[Hui (Māori assembly)|hui]] around New Zealand. The flag is also occasionally encountered with black or white fimbriation and six-pointed stars.

As stated in E.M.C. Barraclough's book ''Flags of the World'' ({{ISBN|978-0723220152}}), The [[Shaw, Savill &amp; Albion Line]] used this flag (though with white fimbriation instead of black and a proportions change from 1:2 to 3:5) as its company flag during its existence from 1882 to 1974.

'''Valencian Sign Language''' ({{lang-ca-valencia|Llengua de signes valenciana}} {{IPA-ca|ˈʎeŋɡwa ðe ˈsiŋnez valensiˈana|}}), or '''LSV''',&lt;ref&gt;Also abbreviated as LSCV (for ''Llengua de signes de la Comunitat Valenciana'') and LSPV (for ''Llengua de signes del País Valencià'')&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[sign language]] used by deaf people in the [[Valencian Community]], [[Spain]]. It is closely related to [[Catalan Sign Language]] (LSC); they are variously described as similar languages or as dialects of a single language. 

Valencia was the first Spanish [[autonomous community]] to support the use of sign language in the Statute of Autonomy, but does not specify which sign language is to be used. The use of LSV in Valencia has, however, diminished and is restricted to administrative communications and occasional usage in the media.

{{Art and video games}}
The concept of '''video games as a form of art''' is a controversial topic within the [[entertainment industry]]. Though [[video game]]s have been afforded legal protection as creative works by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]], the philosophical proposition that video games are works of [[art]] remains in question, even when considering the contribution of expressive elements such as graphics, storytelling and music. Even [[art game]]s, games purposely designed to be a work of creative expression, have been challenged as works of art by some critics.&lt;ref name="Parker"&gt;{{cite journal| title=An Art World for Artgames| author=Felan Parker| url=http://journals.sfu.ca/loading/index.php/loading/article/view/119| journal=Loading...| volume=7| issue=11| pages= 54–55| year=2013| publisher=[[Simon Fraser University]]| issn=1923-2691}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The earliest institutional consideration of the video game as an art form came in the late 1980s when art museums began retrospective displays of then outdated [[History of video games (first-generation systems)|first]] and [[History of video games (second generation)|second generation]] games. In exhibitions such as the [[Museum of the Moving Image (New York City)|Museum of the Moving Image]]'s 1989 "Hot Circuits: A Video Arcade", video games were showcased as preformed works whose quality as art came from the intent of the curator to display them as art.&lt;ref name=stalker&gt;Stalker, Phillipa Jane. ''[http://wiredspace.wits.ac.za/handle/10539/1749 Gaming In Art: A Case Study Of Two Examples Of The Artistic Appropriation Of Computer Games And The Mapping Of Historical Trajectories Of 'Art Games' Versus Mainstream Computer Games]''. [[University of the Witwatersrand]], Johannesburg. 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Further explorations of this theme were set up in the late 1990s and early 2000s with exhibitions like the [[Walker Art Center]]'s "Beyond Interface" (1998),&lt;ref name=holmes2002&gt;Holmes, Tiffany.

[[Gamasutra]]. 8 February 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[University of California, Irvine|UCI]] Beall Centre's "Shift-Ctrl" (2000),&lt;ref name=stalker/&gt; and a number of shows in 2001.&lt;ref name=holmes2002/&gt;

The concept of the video game as a [[Marcel Duchamp|Duchamp]]-style [[Readymades of Marcel Duchamp|readymade]] or as [[found object]] resonated with early developers of the [[art game]]. In her 2003 [[Digital Arts and Culture]] paper, "Arcade Classics Span Art? Current Trends in the Art Game Genre", professor Tiffany Holmes noted that a significant emerging trend within the [[digital art]] community was the development of playable video game pieces referencing or paying homage to earlier classic works like ''[[Breakout (video game)|Breakout]]'', ''[[Asteroids (video game)|Asteroids]]'', ''[[Pac-Man]]'', and ''[[Burgertime]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes, Tiffany. ''[http://hypertext.rmit.edu.au/dac/papers/Holmes.pdf Arcade Classics Span Art? Current Trends in the Art Game Genre] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130420092835/http://hypertext.rmit.edu.au/dac/papers/Holmes.pdf |date=April 20, 2013 }}''. [[Digital Arts and Culture|Melbourne DAC 2003]]. 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; In modifying the code of simplistic early games or by creating [[art mod]]s for more complex games like ''[[Quake (video game)|Quake]]'', the art game genre emerged from the intersection of commercial games and contemporary digital art.&lt;ref name=stalker/&gt;

At the 2010 Art History of Games conference in Atlanta, Georgia, professor [[Celia Pearce]] further noted that alongside Duchamp's art productions, the [[Fluxus]] movement of the 1960s, and most immediately the [[New Games|New Games Movement]] had paved the way for more modern "art games". Works such as Lantz' ''[[Pac-Manhattan|Pac Manhattan]]'', according to Pearce, have become something like performance art pieces.&lt;ref name=pratt/&gt; Most recently, a strong overlap has developed between art games and [[indie game]]s. This meeting of the art game movement and the indie game movement is important according to Professor Pearce, insofar as it brings art games to more eyes and allows for greater potential to explore in indie games.&lt;ref name=pratt/&gt;

In March 2006, the French [[Minister of Culture (France)|Minister of Culture]] first characterized video games as cultural goods and as "a form of artistic expression," granting the industry a tax subsidy&lt;ref&gt;Crampton, Thomas. ''[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/06/business/worldbusiness/06game.html For France, Video Games Are as Artful as Cinema]''. [[New York Times]]. 2 November 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; and inducting two French game designers ([[Michel Ancel]], [[Frédérick Raynal]]) and one Japanese game designer ([[Shigeru Miyamoto]]) into the [[Ordre des Arts et des Lettres]]. In May 2011, the United States [[National Endowment for the Arts]], in accepting grants for art projects for 2012, expanded the allowable projects to include "interactive games", furthering the recognition of video games as an art form.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/109835-Games-Now-Legally-Considered-an-Art-Form-in-the-USA | title= Games Now Legally Considered an Art Form (in the USA) | first = John | last = Funk | date = 2011-05-06 | accessdate = 2011-05-06 | publisher = [[Escapist (magazine)|Escapist]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the [[United States Supreme Court]] ruled that video games were protected speech like other forms of art in the June 2011 decision for ''[[Brown v. Entertainment Merchants Association]]''. In Germany, prior to August 2018, the [[Unterhaltungssoftware Selbstkontrolle]] (USK) software ratings body enforced [[Strafgesetzbuch section 86a|''Strafgesetzbuch'' (German code) section 86a]] as outlined by the German government, which banned the sale of games that contained imagery of extremist groups such as Nazis; while Section 86a allowed for use of these images in artistic and scientific works, video games were not seen to fall within an artistic use. On August 9, 2018, the German government agreed to recognize some of the artistic nature of video games and softened the restriction on Section 86a, allowing the USK to consider games with such imagery as long as they fell within the social adequacy clause of Section 86a.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2018-08-09-germany-relaxes-stance-on-nazi-symbols-in-video-games | title= Germany relaxes stance on Nazi symbols in video games | first = Matthew | last = Handrahan | date = August 9, 2018 | accessdate = August 9, 2018 | work = [[GamesIndustry.biz]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ars tech ban"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/08/german-ratings-board-starts-allowing-nazi-symbols-in-video-games/ | title = Germany says games with Nazi symbols can get “artistic” exception to ban | first=  Kyle | last= Orland | date = August 10, 2018 | accessdate = August 10, 2018 | work = [[Ars Technica]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=dd44ce45-d5cf-4189-a1b6-7bcc7e31605f | title = German Attorney General: Video game with Swastika does not violate the law; constitutes art | first=  Baker | last=McKinsey | date = May 8, 2018 | accessdate = August 10, 2018 | work = [[Lexology]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lines between video games and art become blurred when exhibitions fit the labels of both [[game]] and [[interactive art]]. The [[Smithsonian American Art Museum]] held an exhibit in 2012, entitled "[[The Art of Video Games]]", which was designed to demonstrate the artistic nature of video games, including the impact of older works and the subsequent influence of video games on creative culture.&lt;ref name="smithsonian exhibit"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.americanart.si.edu/exhibitions/archive/2012/games/ | title = Exhibitions: The Art of Video Games | publisher = [[Smithsonian American Art Museum]] | accessdate = 2011-02-16 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110806051435/http://americanart.si.edu/exhibitions/archive/2012/games/ | archive-date = 2011-08-06 | dead-url = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Smithsonian later added ''Flower'' and ''[[Halo 2600]]'', games from this collection, as permanent exhibits within the museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.polygon.com/2013/12/17/5222078/smithsonian-acquires-flower-halo-2600-for-its-permanent-collection | title = Smithsonian acquires Flower, Halo 2600 for its permanent collection | publisher = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] | first = Michael | last = McWhertor | date = 2013-12-17 | accessdate = 2013-12-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York City [[List of video games in the Museum of Modern Art|aims to collect]] forty historically important video games in their original format to exhibit, showcasing video game interaction design as part of a broader effort to "celebrate gaming as an artistic medium".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = https://www.wired.com/gamelife/2012/11/moma-videogames/ | title = MoMA to Exhibit Videogames, From Pong to Minecraft | first = Olivia | last = Solon | work = [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] | date  = 2012-11-29 | accessdate = 2012-11-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The annual "[[Into the Pixel]]" art exhibit held at the time of the [[Electronic Entertainment Expo]] highlights [[video game art]] selected by a panel of both video game and art industry professionals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/13/arts/video-games/pixels-floating-on-the-art-worlds-margins.html | title = Pixels Floating on the Art World’s Margins | first = Harold | last=  Goldberg | date = 2013-06-12 | accessdate = 2013-06-15 | work = [[New York Times]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Empathy games===
{{anchor|Empathy game}}
While many video games are recognized as art for their visual imagery and storytelling, another class of games has gained attention for creating an emotional experience for the player, generally by having the user role-play as a character under a stress-inducing situation, covering topics associated with poverty, sexuality, and physical and mental illnesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.polygon.com/2013/5/9/4313246/gamings-new-frontier-cancer-depression-suicide | title = Gaming's New Frontier: Cancer, Depression, Suicide | first = Colin | last =Campbell | date = May 9, 2013 | accessdate = November 15, 2016 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324769704579010641205335768 | title = Videogames About Alcoholism, Depression and Cancer | first = Conon | last = Dougherty | date = August 15, 2013 | accessdate = November 15, 2016 | work = [[Wall Street Journal]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such games are considered to be examples of an empathy game, loosely described by Patrick Begley of the ''[[Sydney Morning Herald]]'' as a game that "asks players to inhabit their character's emotional worlds".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.smh.com.au/digital-life/games/empathy-gaming-focuses-on-emotions-and-moral-decisions-20140904-10ch4z.html | title = 'Empathy gaming' focuses on emotions and moral decisions | first = Patrick | last = Begley | date = November 1, 2014 | accessdate = November 15, 2016 | work = [[Sydney Morning Herald]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
The characterization of games as works of art has been controversial. While recognizing that games may contain artistic elements in their traditional forms such as graphic art, music, and story, several notable figures have advanced the position that games are not artworks, and may never be capable of being called art.

===Legal status===
American courts first began examining the question of whether video games were entitled to constitutional guarantees of [[Freedom of speech|free speech]] as under the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]], in March 1982 in the case of ''America's Best Family Showplace Corp. v. City of New York, Dept. of Bldgs.''&lt;ref&gt;''America's Best Family Showplace Corp. v. City of New York, Dept. of Bldgs.'', 536 F.Supp. 170, D.C.N.Y., 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; In a brace of similarly decided lawsuits in 1982 and 1983, [[precedent]] began to be established for finding that video games were no more expressive than pinball, chess, board- or card-games, or organized sports. This began to change in 2000 as some courts began to make rulings in distinction and carving out narrow exceptions for some ''elements'' of video games.&lt;ref&gt;''American Amusement Mach. Ass'n v. Kendrick'', 115 F.Supp.2d 943 (S.D.Ind.2000).&lt;/ref&gt;

By April 2002, controversy over the topic was still a legal reality as Judge [[Stephen N. Limbaugh, Sr.]], upon reviewing gameplay from "'[[Resident Evil (1996 video game)|The Resident of Evil Creek]]'{{sic}}, '[[Mortal Combat]]'{{sic}}, '[[Doom (1993 video game)|DOOM]],' and '[[Fear Effect]]'" ruled in ''Interactive Digital Software Association v. St. Louis County'' that "just like [[Bingo (U.S.)|bingo]], the Court fails to see how video games express ideas, impressions, feelings, or information unrelated to the game itself".&lt;ref&gt;''Interactive Digital Software Ass'n v. St. Louis County, Mo.'', 200 F.Supp.2d 1126, E.D.Mo.,2002.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wagner, James. "[http://www.salon.com/2002/05/06/games_as_speech/ Playing games with free speech]". ''Salon''. 6 May 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011's ''[[Brown v. Entertainment Merchants Ass'n|Brown v. Entertainment Merchants Association]]'' the United States Supreme Court ruled that games are entitled to First Amendment protection, with the majority opinion reading, "Like the protected books, plays, and movies that preceded them, video games communicate ideas—and even social messages—through many familiar literary devices (such as characters, dialogue, plot, and music) and through features distinctive to the medium (such as the player's interaction with the virtual world). That suffices to confer First Amendment protection."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/TECH/gaming.gadgets/06/27/supreme.court.video.game.art/|work=CNN|last=Sutter|first=John D.|title=Supreme Court sees video games as art}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theory of legitimation===
Emerging art forms depend upon existing communities for recognition and legitimation, even as they compete with those incumbents for ideological and material support.&lt;ref name="Parker"/&gt; Games have faced suspicion from critics of established media, just as film, television, and comics were once doubted.&lt;ref name="Parker"/&gt; Keith Stewart, games editor for ''[[The Guardian]]'', sees mainstream media as preferring to approach games from the angle of the human stories surrounding them – making indie games with identifiable creators attractive to journalists.&lt;ref name="bizStewart"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2013-03-13-the-first-guardian-keith-stuart-on-getting-games-into-culture|work=gamesindustry.biz|last=Pearson|first=Dan|title=The First Guardian: Keith Stuart on getting games into Culture}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critical communities devoted to games have likewise embraced [[auteur theory]] of games' artistic potential as underpinned by the creative visions of sole creators.&lt;ref name="Parker"/&gt; John Lanchester of the ''[[London Review of Books]]'' noted that even as video games become a larger market by revenues compared to films and books, the amount of attention given to video games is generally delegated to a limited set of sources and do not readily enter the "cultural discourse".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= John |first=Lanchester |date=January 1, 2009 |title=Is It Art? |url= http://www.lrb.co.uk/v31/n01/john-lanchester/is-it-art  |journal= [[London Review of Books]] |publisher=Nicholas Spice |volume=31 |issue=1 |pages=18–20 |doi= |access-date= October 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Auteur theory has led to some overlap between indie status and artistic cachet, with critics praising stylistic choices in indie games, when those same choices would be deplored in a commercial game.&lt;ref name="ibtimesArtGames"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/why-games-matter-indie-movie-fez-meat-427544|work=International Business Times|last=Smith|first=Edward|title=Indie Games Aren't Art Games}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than defending the medium as a whole, proponents of [[art game]]s attempt to create a separate milieu opposed to video games they accept to be [[low culture]].&lt;ref name="Parker"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ibtimesArtGames"/&gt; In practice, indie auteurs often receive commercial backing, while mainstream creators such as Shigeru Miyamoto and Peter Molyneux are increasingly viewed as auteurs as well.&lt;ref name="Parker"/&gt; The conflation of indieness and artistry has been criticized by some, including [[Anna Anthropy]],&lt;ref name="Parker"/&gt; [[Lucy Kellaway]],&lt;ref name="ibtimesArtGames"/&gt; and [[Jim Munroe]],&lt;ref name="sparkMunroe"/&gt; who argue the characteristics that distinguish indie games from the mainstream are not inherently artistic.

Munroe suggested that video games often face a double standard in that if they conform to traditional notions of the game as a toy for children then they are flippantly dismissed as trivial and non-artistic, but if they push the envelope by introducing serious adult themes into games then they face negative criticism and controversy for failing to conform to the very standards of non-artistic triviality demanded by these traditional notions. He further explained games as a type of art more akin to architecture, in which the artist creates a space for the audience to experience on their own terms, than to a non-interactive presentation as in cinema.&lt;ref name="sparkMunroe"&gt;Young, Nora &amp; Misener, Dan. ''[http://www.cbc.ca/spark/2011/10/repeat-of-spark-126-october-16-19-2011 Repeat of Spark 126 – October 16 &amp; 19, 2011: Games as Art]'' (Podcast available: [http://podcast.cbc.ca/spark/plus-spark_20101107_spark126c.mp3 Games as Art] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141029074320/http://podcast.cbc.ca/spark/plus-spark_20101107_spark126c.mp3 |date=October 29, 2014 }}). ''[[Spark (radio show)|Spark]]''. 7 November 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Video game designer [[Kim Swift]] believes games can be artistic but denies that they need to be art in order to have cultural value. She feels video games should aspire to be toys through which adults can exercise their imaginations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/2012/06/kim-swift-interview/|work=WIRED|last=Rigney|first=Ryan|title=Portal Designer Kim Swift Won't Let You Take Her Toys Away}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Roger Ebert on video games as art===
The question rose to wide public attention in the mid-2000s when film critic [[Roger Ebert]] participated in a series of controversial debates and published colloquies. In 2005, following an online discussion concerning whether or not knowledge of the game ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'' was essential to a proper appreciation of the film ''[[Doom (film)|Doom]]'' (which Ebert had awarded one star) as a commentary on the game,&lt;ref name=moriarty&gt;Moriarty, Brian; Caoili, Eric (ed.). ''[http://www.gamesetwatch.com/2011/03/opinion_brian_moriartys_apolog.php Opinion: Brian Moriarty's Apology For Roger Ebert]''. [[GameSetWatch]]. 15 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Ebert described video games as a non-artistic medium incomparable to the more established art forms:

{{quote|text=To my knowledge, no one in or out of the field has ever been able to cite a game worthy of comparison with the great dramatists, poets, filmmakers, novelists and composers. That a game can aspire to artistic importance as a visual experience, I accept. But for most gamers, video games represent a loss of those precious hours we have available to make ourselves more cultured, civilized and empathetic.|sign=[[Roger Ebert]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.rogerebert.com/answer-man/why-did-the-chicken-cross-the-genders | title = Why did the chicken cross the genders? | date = 2005-11-27 | accessdate = 2010-08-31 | work =[[Chicago Sun-Times]] | first = Roger | last = Ebert }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 2006, Ebert took part in a panel discussion at the [[Conference on World Affairs]] entitled "An Epic Debate: Are Video Games an Art Form?" in which he stated that video games don't explore the meaning of being human as other art forms do.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url  = http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060418/SCANNERS/60418001 | title = Video games: The 'epic debate' | first  =Jim | last =Emerson | date = 2006-04-16 | accessdate =2010-08-31 | work = [[Chicago Sun-Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference | title = An Epic Debate: Are Video Games an Art Form? | conference = 62nd Annual Conference on World Affairs | conferenceurl = http://www.colorado.edu/cwa/search_results.html?date=7&amp;year=2006 | date = 2006-04-13 | accessdate = 2010-08-31 | first = Roger | last = Ebert }}&lt;/ref&gt; A year later, in response to comments from [[Clive Barker]] on the panel discussion, Ebert further noted that video games present a malleability that would otherwise ruin other forms of art. As an example, Ebert posed the idea of a version of ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' that would allow for an optional happy ending. Such an option, according to Ebert, would weaken the artistic expression of the original work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070721/COMMENTARY/70721001 | title=  Games vs. Art: Ebert vs. Barker  | date = 2007-07-21 | accessdate = 2010-08-31 | first = Roger | last = Ebert | work = [[Chicago Sun-Times]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In April 2010, Ebert published an essay, dissecting a presentation made by [[Kellee Santiago]] of [[thatgamecompany]] at the 2009 [[TED (conference)|Technology Entertainment Design Conference]], where he again claimed that games can never be art, due to their rules and goal-based interactivity.&lt;ref name="ebert gamesart"&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://blogs.suntimes.com/ebert/2010/04/video_games_can_never_be_art.html | title = Video games can never be art | work = [[Chicago Sun-Times]] | first = Roger | last = Ebert | date = 2010-04-16 | accessdate = 2010-08-31 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20111010001841/http://blogs.suntimes.com/ebert/2010/04/video_games_can_never_be_art.html | archive-date = 2011-10-10 | dead-url = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|text=One obvious difference between art and games is that you can win a game. It has rules, points, objectives, and an outcome. Santiago might cite a [''[[sic]]''] immersive game without points or rules, but I would say then it ceases to be a game and becomes a representation of a story, a novel, a play, dance, a film. Those are things you cannot win; you can only experience them.|sign=[[Roger Ebert]]&lt;ref name="ebert gamesart"/&gt;}}

Ebert's essay was strongly criticized by the gaming community,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.fastcompany.com/1621426/game-designer-kellee-santiago-responds-to-roger-eberts-video-games-are-not-art-rant | title= Game Designer Kellee Santiago Responds to Roger Ebert's "Video Games Are Not Art" Rant  | first = Dan | last = Nosowitz | date = 2010-04-20 | accessdate =2010-08-31 | publisher = [[Fast Company (magazine)|Fast Company]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.wired.com/underwire/2010/04/alt-text-videogames-as-art/ | title = Alt Text: Are Videogames Art?

Moving On… [My Response to Ebert] | first = Kellee | last = Santiago | date =2010-04-19 | accessdate = 2010-08-31 | publisher = [[thatgamecompany]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ebert later amended his comments in 2010, conceding that games may indeed be art in a non-traditional sense, that he had enjoyed playing ''[[Cosmology of Kyoto]]'', and addressing some replies to his original arguments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blogs.suntimes.com/ebert/2010/07/okay_kids_play_on_my_lawn.html |title=Okay, kids, play on my lawn |date=2010-07-01 |accessdate=2010-08-31 |work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] |first=Roger |last=Ebert |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100811003526/http://blogs.suntimes.com/ebert/2010/07/okay_kids_play_on_my_lawn.html |archivedate=August 11, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Ebert did not engage with the issue again and his view remains mired in controversy, the notion that video games are ineligible to be considered [[fine art]] due to their commercial appeal and structure as choice-driven narratives has proved persuasive for many including video game luminary [[Brian Moriarty]] who in March 2011 gave a lecture on the topic entitled ''An [[Apologetics|Apology]] For Roger Ebert''.&lt;ref name=moriarty/&gt; In this lecture Moriarty emphasized that video games are merely an extension of traditional rule-based games and that there has been no call to declare games like [[Chess]] and [[Go (game)|Go]] to be art. He went on to argue that art in the sense that [[Romanticism|Romantics]] like Ebert, [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]], and he were concerned with (i.e. fine art or sublime art) is exceptionally rare and that Ebert was being consistent by declaring video games to be without artistic merit inasmuch as Ebert had previously claimed that "Hardly any movies are art."&lt;ref name=moriarty/&gt; Moriarty decried the modern expansion of the definition of "art" to include [[low art]], comparing video games to [[kitsch]] and describing aesthetic appreciation of video games as [[Camp (style)|camp]]. After addressing the corrupting influence of commercial forces in [[indie games]] and the difficulty of setting out to create art given the "slippery" tools that game designers must work with, Moriarty concluded that ultimately it was the fact that player choices were presented in games that structurally invalidated the application of the term "art" to video games as the audience's interaction with the work wrests control from the author and thereby negates the expression of art.&lt;ref name=moriarty/&gt; This lecture was in turn criticized sharply by noted video game designer, [[Zach Gage]].&lt;ref name=moriarty/&gt;

===Other notable critics===
In a 2006 interview with ''[[Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine|US Official PlayStation 2 Magazine]]'', game designer [[Hideo Kojima]] agreed with Ebert's assessment that video games are not art. Kojima acknowledged that games may contain artwork, but he stressed the intrinsically popular nature of video games in contrast to the niche interests served by art. Since the highest ideal of all video games is to achieve 100% player satisfaction whereas art is targeted to at least one person, Kojima argued that video game creation is more of a service than an artistic endeavor.&lt;ref&gt;Gibson, Ellie. ''[http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/news240106kojimaart Games aren't art, says Kojima]''. Eurogamer. 24 January 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the 2010 Art History of Games conference, Michael Samyn and Auriea Harvey (founding members of indie studio [[Tale of Tales (developer)|Tale of Tales]]), argued in no uncertain terms that games "are not art" and that they are by and large "a waste of time." Central to Tale of Tales' distinction between games and art is the purposive nature of games as opposed to art: Whereas humans possess a biological need that is only satisfied by [[Play (activity)|play]], argues Samyn, and as play has manifested itself in the form of [[game]]s, games represent nothing more than a physiological necessity. Art, on the other hand, is not created out of a physical need but rather it represents a search for higher purposes. Thus the fact that a game acts to fulfill the physical needs of the player is sufficient, according to Samyn, to disqualify it as art.&lt;ref name=pratt/&gt;

Gamers were surprised by this controversial stance due to the frequency of prior third-party characterizations of Tale of Tales' productions as "art games," however Tale of Tales clarified that the games they were making simply expanded the conception of games. The characterization of their games as "art games," noted Samyn, was merely a byproduct of the imaginative stagnation and lack of progressivism in the video game industry. While Tale of Tales acknowledged that old media featuring one-way communication was not enough, and that two-way communication via computers offers the way forward for art, the studio argued that such communication today is being held hostage by the [[video game industry]].&lt;ref name=pratt/&gt; To enable and foment this futuristic two-way art, suggests Tale of Tales, the concept of "the game" must be eviscerated by games that do not fit within the current paradigm and then "life must be breathed into the carcass" through the creation of artworks Samyn and Harvey refer to as "not games."&lt;ref name=pratt/&gt;

In 2011, Samyn further refined his argument that games are not art by emphasizing the fact that games are systematic and rule-based. Samyn identified an industry emphasis on [[gameplay mechanics]] as directly responsible for the marginalization of artistic narrative in games and he described modern video games as little more than digital sport. Pointing to systemic problems, Samyn criticized the current model whereby the putative artist must work through a large and highly efficient [[Video game development|development team]] who may not share the artist's vision. However, Samyn does not reject the idea that games, as a medium, can be used to create art. To create art using the medium of the video game Samyn suggests that the artistic message must precede the means of its expression in the guidance of gameplay mechanics, the development of "[[fun]]ness" or economic considerations must cease to guide the work's creation, and the development process must embrace a model wherein a single artist-author's vision gains central primacy.&lt;ref&gt;Samyn, Michael.

In 2012, ''[[The Guardian|Guardian]]'' art critic [[Jonathan Jones (journalist)|Jonathan Jones]] published an article arguing that games are more like a playground and not art. Jones also notes that the nature of creating video games robs "one person’s reaction to life" and that "no one owns the game, so there is no artist, and therefore no work of art."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2012/nov/30/moma-video-games-art|title=Sorry MoMA, video games are not art|last=Jones|first=Jonathan|date=2012-11-30|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|access-date=2016-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, video game journalist Patricia Hernandez described a [[Puzzle video game|puzzle]] in the [[interactive fiction]] game ''[[Photopia]]''. The solution of the puzzle involves a [[Reveal (narrative)|reveal]] regarding the player's controlled [[Player character|playable character]], prompting experiences which Hernandez argues could not be made "as powerful as they are" in any other art form without interactivity. Hernandez says that narrations in the interactive medium happen in the [[First-person narrative|first person]] and the [[present tense]], which are "fundamental (and often misunderstood) elements of the interactive medium".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://nightmaremode.thegamerstrust.com/2013/01/19/a-moment-of-perfect-beauty/|title=A Moment of Perfect Beauty|date=2013-01-19|work=Nightmare Mode [Archived]|access-date=2017-10-03|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plot ==
Reality show contestant [[Kimberly Caldwell]] is driving through the West Virginia back country searching for the location of her next project. While driving, she accidentally hits a human figure. She stops to help him, but he bites her lips off, revealing him to be Brother, a mutant cannibal. She attempts to escape but runs into Three Finger, who splits her in half vertically with an ax. He and Brother drag her body away as her intestines lie on the road.

Former U.S. Marine Colonel Dale Murphy is hosting a survival reality game show ''The Apocalypse: Ultimate Survivalist'', in the West Virginia forest with contestants lingerie model Elena, skateboarder Jonesy, Iraq veteran Amber, former football player Jake and a goth Nina. When Kimberly does not show up, unbeknownst to them, the show's producer Mara reluctantly takes her place.

When the game starts, Three Finger kills Neil, one of the television crew. While Dale prepares for the games, Three Finger and another cannibal Pa, attack and knock him unconscious. Meanwhile, Mara enters the cabin to try to find a telephone as Nina follows her. While they look around the cabin, they hear the occupants return, so they hide in a bedroom. They witness a female cannibal, Ma, giving birth to a deformed baby. Her daughter, Sister, spots Nina and Mara in the bedroom, forcing the two to escape through the toilet pit. They run into the woods, but Mara is hit in the head with an ax thrown by Pa. Nina searches for the others as the cannibals collect Mara's body.

After showrunner, Elena bribes M, the show's editor, by performing fellatio on him to get more screen time and then has sex with him. M returns to the RV while Elena stays by a lake to tan in her underwear. When Elena hears the cannibals, she starts to get dressed as Sister emerges from the bushes and slashes her spine with a machete and kills her. While M is in the RV, Ma and Pa hijack it. Pa attacks M and captures him. Meanwhile, Dale manages to escape and battles Three Finger. After a short fight, Dale shoots Three Finger with a shotgun and he flies to the lake behind.

As Jake, Amber, and Jonesy are eating some meat they found, Nina returns and explains about the cannibals. When Jake realizes it was Kimberly's leg they had been eating, he, Nina, Amber and Jonesy attempt to escape. Dale finds old man Maynard in a cabin he enters. Maynard tells him how the cannibals' mutations were caused by inbreeding and effluent dumped in the river by the abandoned paper mill. He then reveals that he is their father and attacks Dale. After a brief skirmish, Dale kills Maynard by blowing him up with a stick of dynamite. After finding the RV gone, the others run towards the woods and encounter Brother and Sister. After fighting the cannibals, Jake searches for Nina while Amber and Jonesy go for help. Jake rescues Nina from a pit and they jump into the river to escape Sister. Brother and Pa then kill Amber and Jonesy with an arrow to their heads.

Nina and Jake enter the mill and find a garage full of vehicles stolen from prior victims. They find the RV, and Jake enters it and witnesses M being decapitated by Ma on a live feed monitor inside. Nina and Jake attempt to leave but the cannibals capture them. The abandoned mill is revealed to be the mutants' home. Jake is strung up and Nina is strapped to a chair with barbed wire. The mutants eat dinner and force feed, Nina.

Dale sneaks into the compound and distracts the cannibals. As the cannibals are searching for him, Dale manages to kill Brother and Sister with dynamite attached to an arrow. He frees Nina and Jake, but is killed by Ma and Pa, who were incensed by the deaths of their children. Nina successfully escapes, but Jake wanders into a room fitted with an enormous tree debarker, where he is attacked by Ma and Pa. Nina returns to the mill and kills Ma and Pa with the debarker. Nina and Jake find Kimberly's abandoned car and drive away. Meanwhile, Three Finger has survived and is feeding the deformed baby with a finger revealing he's still out there.
