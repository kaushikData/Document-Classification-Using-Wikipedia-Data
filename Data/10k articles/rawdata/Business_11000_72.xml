'''Andrew William Mellon''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|ɛ|l|ə|n}}; March 24, 1855&amp;nbsp;– August 26, 1937), sometimes '''A.W.''', was an [[United States|American]] banker, businessman, industrialist, philanthropist, art collector, and politician. From the wealthy [[Mellon family]] of [[Pittsburgh]], [[Pennsylvania]], he established a vast business empire before transitioning into politics. He served as [[United States Secretary of the Treasury]] from March 9, 1921, to February 12, 1932, presiding over the boom years of the 1920s and the [[Wall Street crash of 1929]]. A conservative [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]], Mellon favored policies that reduced taxation and the national debt in the aftermath of [[World War I]].

Mellon's father, [[Thomas Mellon]], rose to prominence in Pittsburgh as a banker and attorney. Andrew began working at his father's bank, T. Mellon &amp; Sons, in the early 1870s, eventually becoming the leading figure in the institution. He later renamed T. Mellon &amp; Sons as Mellon National Bank and established another financial institution, the Union Trust Company. By the end of 1913, Mellon National Bank held more money in deposits than any other bank in Pittsburgh, and the second-largest bank in the region was controlled by Union Trust. In the course of his business career, Mellon owned or helped finance [[Alcoa]], the [[New York Shipbuilding Corporation]], [[Old Overholt]] whiskey, [[Standard Steel Car Company]], [[Westinghouse Electric Corporation]], [[Koppers]], the [[Pittsburgh Coal Company]], the Carborundum Company, Union Steel Company, the McClintic-Marshall Construction Company, [[Gulf Oil]], and numerous other businesses. He was also an influential donor to the Republican Party during the [[Gilded Age]] and the [[Progressive Era]].

In 1921, newly-elected President [[Warren G. Harding]] chose Mellon as his [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|Secretary of the Treasury]]. Mellon would remain in office until 1932, serving under Harding, [[Calvin Coolidge]], and [[Herbert Hoover]], all three of whom were members of the Republican Party. Mellon sought to reform federal taxation in the aftermath of World War I, cutting taxes on top earners but leaving in place a [[Progressive tax|progressive]] [[Income tax in the United States|income tax]]. Some of Mellon's proposals were enacted by the [[Revenue Act of 1921]] and the [[Revenue Act of 1924]], but it was not until the passage of [[Revenue Act of 1926]] that the "Mellon plan" was fully realized. He also presided over a reduction in the national debt, which dropped substantially in the 1920s. Mellon's influence in state and national politics reached its zenith during Coolidge's presidency; one observer noted that "it would be fair to call the [Coolidge] administration the reign of Coolidge and Mellon."

Mellon's national reputation collapsed following the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]] and the onset of the [[Great Depression]]. Mellon participated in various efforts by the Hoover administration to revive the economy and maintain the international economic order, but he opposed direct government intervention in the economy. After Congress began impeachment proceedings against Mellon, President Hoover shifted Mellon to the position of [[List of ambassadors of the United States to the United Kingdom|United States ambassador to the United Kingdom]]. Mellon returned to private life after Hoover's defeat in the 1932 presidential election by [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]. Beginning in 1933, the federal government launched a tax fraud investigation on Mellon, leading to a high-profile case that ended with Mellon's exoneration. Shortly before his death in 1937, Mellon helped establish the [[National Gallery of Art]], a national art museum. His philanthropic efforts also played a major role in the later establishment of [[Carnegie Mellon University]] and the [[National Portrait Gallery (United States)|National Portrait Gallery]].

==Early life and ancestry==
{{see also|Mellon family}}

Mellon's paternal grandparents, both of whom were [[Ulster Scots people|Ulster Scots]], migrated to the United States from [[County Tyrone]], [[Ireland]] in 1818.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), pp. 3–4&lt;/ref&gt; With their son, [[Thomas Mellon]], they settled in [[Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas Mellon established a successful legal practice in [[Pittsburgh]], and in 1843 he married Sarah Jane Negley, an heiress descended from some of the first settlers of Pittsburgh.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), pp. 12, 17, 19&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas became a wealthy landowner and real estate speculator, and he and his wife had eight children, five of whom survived to adulthood. Andrew Mellon, the fourth son and sixth child of Thomas and Sarah, was born in 1855.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), pp. 20–28&lt;/ref&gt; Though he lacked strong convictions about [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]], Thomas Mellon became a prominent member of the local [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], and in 1859 he won election to a position on the [[Pennsylvania courts of common pleas|Pennsylvania court of common pleas]].&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), pp. 30–31&lt;/ref&gt; Because Thomas was suspicious of both private and public schools, he built a schoolhouse for his children and hired a teacher; Andrew attended this school beginning at age five.&lt;ref name="npsjtown"&gt;{{cite web |title=Andrew William Mellon (1855-1937) |url=https://www.nps.gov/jofl/learn/historyculture/andrew-william-mellon.htm |website=Johnstown Flood |publisher=National Park Service |accessdate=14 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1869, after leaving his judicial position, Thomas Mellon established T. Mellon &amp; Sons, a bank located in Pittsburgh. Andrew joined his father at the bank, quickly becoming a valued employee despite being in his early teens. Andrew also attended Western University (which was later renamed the [[University of Pittsburgh]]), but he never graduated.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), pp. 44–48&lt;/ref&gt; After leaving Western University, Andrew briefly worked at a lumber and coal business before joining T. Mellon &amp; Sons as a full-time employee in 1873. That same year, the [[Panic of 1873]] devastated the local and national economy, wiping out a portion of the Mellon fortune.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), pp. 53–56&lt;/ref&gt; With Andrew taking a leading role at T. Mellon &amp; Sons, the bank quickly recovered, and by late 1874 the bank's deposits had reached the level they had been at prior to the onset of the Panic.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), pp. 61–64&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business career, 1873–1920==
===Business career, 1873–1898===

Mellon's role at T. Mellon &amp; Sons continued to grow after 1873, and in 1876 he was given power of attorney to direct the operations of the bank. That same year, Thomas introduced his son to [[Henry Clay Frick]], a customer of the bank who would become one of Mellons's closest friends. In 1882, Thomas turned over full ownership of the bank to his son, but Thomas continued to be involved in the bank's activities.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), pp. 64–67&lt;/ref&gt; Five years later, Mellon's younger brother, [[Richard B. Mellon]], joined T. Mellon &amp; Sons as a co-owner and vice president.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), pp. 87–88&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1880s, Mellon began to expand the bank's activities. Along with Frick, Mellon gained control the Pittsburgh National Bank of Commerce, a [[National Bank Act|national bank]] that was authorized to print [[banknote]]s. Mellon also acquired or helped found the Union Insurance Company, City Deposit Bank, the Fidelity Title and Trust Company, and the Union Trust Company. He branched out into industrial concerns, becoming a director of the [[Pittsburgh Stock Exchange|Pittsburgh Petroleum Exchange]] and a co-founder of two [[natural gas]] companies that collectively controlled 35,000 acres of gas lands in the late 1880s.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), pp. 79–80, 96&lt;/ref&gt; In 1890, Thomas Mellon transferred his properties to Andrew, who would manage the properties on behalf of himself, his parents, and his brothers.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), pp. 90–91&lt;/ref&gt; In late 1894, Thomas transferred all of his remaining assets to Andrew.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), p. 94&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the large sums entrusted to Andrew, the businesses he ran were still fairly small in the 1890s; T. Mellon &amp; Sons employed seven individuals in 1895.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), p. 96&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1889, Mellon agreed to loan $25,000 to the Pittsburgh Reduction Company, a fledgling operation seeking to become the first successful industrial producer of [[aluminum]]. Mellon became a director of the company in 1891, and he and Richard played a major role in the establishment of aluminum factories in [[New Kensington, Pennsylvania]] and [[Niagara Falls, New York]].&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), pp. 97–98&lt;/ref&gt; The company would emerge as one of the most profitable ventures invested in by the Mellons, and in 1907 it was renamed as [[Alcoa]].&lt;ref name="Cannadine 2006, p. 184"&gt;Cannadine (2006), p. 184&lt;/ref&gt; Moving into the petroleum industry, the Mellon family also established the Crescent Oil Company, the Crescent Pipeline Company, and the Bear Creek refinery. By 1894, the Mellon family's [[Vertical integration|vertically-integrated]] companies produced ten percent of the oil exported by the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), pp. 99–102&lt;/ref&gt; Partly due to the difficult economic conditions caused by the onset of the [[Panic of 1893]], in 1895 the Mellons sold their oil interests to [[Standard Oil]]. At roughly the same time they were selling their oil concerns, Andrew and Richard invested in the Carborundum Company, a producer of [[silicon carbide]]. The brothers gained majority ownership of the Carborundum Company in 1898, and replaced the company's founder and president, [[Edward Goodrich Acheson]], with a Carnegie protege, Frank W. Haskell.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), pp. 117–120&lt;/ref&gt; Mellon also invested in mining concerns, becoming vice president of the Trade Dollar Consolidated Mining Company.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), pp. 121–122&lt;/ref&gt;

Mellon and Henry Clay Frick enjoyed a long-lasting business and social relationship, and Frick frequently hosted Mellon, attorney [[Philander C. Knox]], inventor [[George Westinghouse]], and others for [[poker]] games. Frick and Mellon both joined the [[Duquesne Club]] and, after Frick established the [[South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club]], Mellon became one of that club's first members.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), p. 81, 106–107&lt;/ref&gt; The South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club built the [[South Fork Dam]], which supported an artificial lake that the club used for boating and fishing. In 1889, the dam broke, causing the [[Johnstown Flood]], which killed 2,000 people and destroyed 1,600 homes. In the aftermath of the flood, Knox led a legal defense that successfully argued that the club bore no legal responsibility for the flood. Mellon did not publicly comment on the flood, though he did donate $1,000 to a relief fund.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), p. 108&lt;/ref&gt;

===Business career, 1898–1920===

By the late 1890s, Mellon had amassed a substantial fortune, but his wealth paled in comparison to better-known business leaders such as [[John D. Rockefeller]].&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), pp. 127–128&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1890s, the Union Trust Company emerged for the first time as one of Mellon's most important and profitable holdings after Mellon broadened the company's activities to include commercial banking. With an infusion of capital from Union Trust, Mellon underwrote the capitalization of National Glass and several other companies. He also became a co-owner of the McClintic-Marshall Construction Company and established Crucible Steel Company, the [[Pittsburgh Coal Company]], and the [[Monongahela River Consolidated Coal and Coke Company|Monongahela River Coal Company]]; the two coal companies collectively contributed 11 percent of the coal production of the United States. With Frick, Richard Mellon, and [[William Donner]], Mellon co-founded Union Steel Company, which specialized in the production of nails and [[barbed wire]]. Though Frick had fallen out with steel magnate and long-time business partner [[Andrew Carnegie]], Mellon received Carnegie's consent to venture into the steel industry. Responding to the growing emphasis on naval power in the aftermath of the [[Spanish–American War]], Mellon and Frick also became major shareholders in the [[New York Shipbuilding Corporation]].&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), pp. 134–139&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mellon National Bank Building Pittsburgh.jpg|thumb|The [[Mellon National Bank Building]], which served as the headquarters of Mellon National Bank after it was completed in 1924]]

In 1902, Mellon reorganized T. Mellon &amp; Sons as the Mellon National Bank, a federally-chartered National Bank. Andrew Mellon, Richard Mellon, and Frick drew up a new business arrangement in which the three of them jointly controlled the Union Trust Company, which in turn controlled Mellon National Bank. They also established Union Savings Bank, which accepted deposits by mail, and the Mellon banks flourished in the first years of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), pp. 162–164&lt;/ref&gt; While Mellon's financial empire prospered, his investments in other areas, including Pittsburgh's streetcar network, the Union Steel Company (which was bought out by [[U.S. Steel]]), and the Carborundum Company, also paid off handsomely.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), pp. 165–167&lt;/ref&gt; Another successful Mellon investment, the [[Standard Steel Car Company]], was created in partnership with three former U.S. Steel executives.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), pp. 176–177&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the [[Texas oil boom]], the Mellons also helped J. M. Guffey establish the Guffey Company.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), pp. 178–179&lt;/ref&gt; The Mellons later removed Guffey as the head of his company, and in 1907 they reorganized the Guffey Company as [[Gulf Oil]] and installed [[William Larimer Mellon Sr.]] (a son of Andrew Mellon's older brother, James Ross Mellon) as the head of Gulf Oil.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), pp. 179, 183–184&lt;/ref&gt; The success of Mellon's financial empire and his varied investments made him, according to biographer David Cannadine, the "single most significant individual in the economic life and progress of western Pennsylvania" in the first decade of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), pp. 180–181&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Panic of 1907]] devastated several companies based in Pittsburgh, ending a period of strong growth.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), pp. 216–217, 219&lt;/ref&gt; Some of Mellon's investments experienced a sustained down period after 1907, but most experienced a quick recovery. Mellon also became an investor in [[George Westinghouse]]'s [[Westinghouse Electric Corporation]] after he helped prevent the company from going into bankruptcy.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), pp. 225–228&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of 1913, Mellon National Bank held more money in deposits than any other bank in Pittsburgh, and the Farmer's Deposit National Bank, which held the second-largest amount of deposits, was controlled by Mellon's Union Trust Company.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), pp. 228–230&lt;/ref&gt; In 1914, Mellon became a co-owner of [[Koppers]], which produced a more sophisticated [[Coke (fuel)|coking]] oven than the one that had earlier been pioneered by Frick.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), pp. 242–244&lt;/ref&gt; He also served as a director of various other companies, including the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] and the [[American Locomotive Company]].&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), p. 257&lt;/ref&gt; Mellon was deeply involved in the financing of [[World War I]], as the Union Trust Company and other Mellon institutions provided millions of dollars in loans to the [[United Kingdom]] and [[France]], and Mellon himself invested in [[Liberty bond]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), pp. 252–254&lt;/ref&gt;

===Old Overholt whiskey===

In 1887, Frick, Andrew, and Richard Mellon jointly purchased [[Old Overholt]], a whiskey distillery located in  [[West Overton, Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), pp. 81–82&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wondrich-1"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wondrich|first1=David|title=The Rise &amp; Fall of America's Oldest Whiskey|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/09/02/the-rise-fall-of-america-s-oldest-whiskey.html|accessdate=3 October 2016|publisher=The Daily Beast|date=2 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, Old Overholt was one of the largest and most respected whiskey producers in the country.&lt;ref name="Wondrich-2" /&gt; In 1907, as prohibition became more popular across the country, Frick and Mellon removed their names from the distilling license, but retained ownership in the company.&lt;ref name="Wondrich-2"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wondrich|first1=David|title=How Pennsylvania Rye Whiskey Lost Its Way|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/09/12/how-pennsylvania-rye-whiskey-lost-its-way.html|accessdate=3 October 2016|publisher=[[The Daily Beast]]|date=12 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed that Mellon's connections in the Treasury Department are what allowed the company to secure a medicinal permit during Prohibition.&lt;ref name="Wondrich-2" /&gt; This permit allowed Overholt to sell existing whiskey stocks to druggists for medicinal use.&lt;ref name="Wondrich-2" /&gt; When Frick died in December 1919, he left his share to Mellon.&lt;ref name="Wondrich-2" /&gt; In 1925, under pressure from prohibitionists, Mellon sold his share of the company to a New York grocer.&lt;ref name="Wondrich-2" /&gt;

===Early involvement in politics===
{{see also|Gilded Age|Progressive Era}}

Like his father, Mellon consistently supported the Republican Party, and he frequently donated to state and local party leaders. Through state party boss [[Matthew Quay]], Mellon influenced legislators to place high tariffs on aluminum products in the [[McKinley Tariff]] of 1890.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), pp. 110–111&lt;/ref&gt; During the early 20th century, Mellon was dismayed by the rise of [[Progressive Era|progressivism]] and the [[United States antitrust law|antitrust]] actions pursued by the presidential administrations of [[Theodore Roosevelt]], [[William Howard Taft]], and [[Woodrow Wilson]]. He especially opposed the Taft administration's investigations into Alcoa, which in 1912 signed a [[consent decree]] rather than going to trial.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), pp. 220–222&lt;/ref&gt; In the aftermath of World War I, he provided financial support to [[Henry Cabot Lodge]] and other Republicans in their successful campaign to prevent ratification of the [[Treaty of Versailles]]. Mellon attended the [[1920 Republican National Convention]] as a nominal supporter of Pennsylvania Governor [[William Cameron Sproul]] (Mellon hoped Senator Philander Knox would win the nomination), but the convention chose Senator [[Warren G. Harding]] of Ohio as the party's presidential nominee. Mellon strongly approved of the party's conservative platform, and he served as a key fundraiser for Harding during the presidential campaign.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), pp. 266–268&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political career, 1921–1933==
[[File:Portrait photograph of A.W. Mellon.jpg|thumb|Portrait photograph of A.W. Mellon, 1924]]

===Harding administration===
{{see also|Presidency of Warren G. Harding}}

Following Harding's victory in the 1920 presidential election, Harding considered various candidates for Secretary of the Treasury, including [[Frank Lowden]], [[John W. Weeks]], [[Charles Dawes]], and, at the urging of Senator Knox, Andrew Mellon.&lt;ref&gt;Murray (1973), pp. 513–514, 517&lt;/ref&gt; By 1920, Mellon was little-known outside of banking circles, but his potential appointment to the cabinet received strong support from bankers and Pennsylvania Republican leaders like Knox, Senator [[Boies Penrose]], and Governor Sproul. Mellon was reluctant to enter public life due to concerns about privacy and a belief that his ownership of various businesses, including Old Overholt distillery, would be a political liability.&lt;ref&gt;Murray (1973), pp. 517–519&lt;/ref&gt; But Mellon also wanted to retire from active participation in business, and he saw a cabinet position as a prestigious capstone to his career.&lt;ref&gt;Murray (1973), pp. 525–526&lt;/ref&gt;

Mellon agreed to accept appointment as Secretary of the Treasury in February 1921, and his nomination was quickly confirmed by the [[United States Senate]]. Though Mellon's supporters believed that he was highly qualified to address the economic issues facing the country, critics of the Harding administration saw the Mellon appointment as a sign that Harding would "reseat the power of special privileged interests, the powers of avarice and greed, the powers that seek self-aggrandizement at the expense of the general public."&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), pp. 273–274&lt;/ref&gt; Harding paired the nomination of Mellon with that of Secretary of Commerce [[Herbert Hoover]], who was distrusted by many of the same Senate Republicans who favored Mellon's candidacy.&lt;ref&gt;Murray (1973), pp. 527–530&lt;/ref&gt; Before joining the cabinet, Mellon sold his banking stock to his brother, Richard, but he continued to hold his non-banking stock.&lt;ref&gt;Murray (1973), p. 526&lt;/ref&gt; Through Richard and other business associates, Mellon continued to be involved with the major decisions of the Mellon business empire during his time in public service, and he occasionally lobbied congressmen on behalf of his businesses.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), pp. 296–298, 323&lt;/ref&gt; His fortune continued to grow, and at one point in the 1920s he paid more in federal income tax than any other individual save John Rockefeller and [[Henry Ford]].&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), p. 349&lt;/ref&gt;

As Treasury Secretary, Mellon focused on balancing the budget and paying off World War I debts in the midst of the [[Depression of 1920–21]]; he was largely unconcerned with international affairs and economic matters such as the unemployment rate.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), pp. 279–280&lt;/ref&gt; To Mellon's chagrin, his department was charged with enforcing Prohibition; he did not believe in teetotaling himself and viewed the law as unenforceable.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), p. 291&lt;/ref&gt; Aside from balancing the budget, Mellon's top priority was an overhaul of the federal tax code.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), pp. 286–287&lt;/ref&gt; The income tax had become a major part of the federal government's revenue system with the passage of the [[Revenue Act of 1913]], and federal taxation on income had increased during [[World War I]] to provide funding for the war effort. According to M. Susan Murnane, major reforms to the federal income tax in the aftermath of World War I were "inevitable," but the exact nature of the tax system in the 1920s was debated by conservatives and progressives within the Republican Party. Unlike the progressives in his party, Mellon rejected the redistributive nature of the taxation system that had been left in place by the Wilson administration. Due in part to the high debts left over from the war, Mellon did not join with some conservatives in the party, who favored the virtual abolition of the income tax in favor of high tariff rates, excise taxes, a national sales tax, or some combination thereof.&lt;ref name="murnane820822"/&gt;

Mellon instead advocated for the retention of a progressive income tax that would serve as an important, but not primary, source of revenue for the federal government. His so-called "scientific taxation" was designed to maximize federal revenue while minimizing the impact on business and industry.&lt;ref name="murnane820822"/&gt; The central tenet of Mellon's tax plan was a reduction of the surtax, a progressive tax that only affected high-income earners. Mellon argued that such a reduction would minimize tax avoidance and would not affect federal revenue because it would lead to greater economic growth.&lt;ref&gt;Murnane (2004), pp. 825–826, 837–838&lt;/ref&gt; He hoped that tax reform would encourage high earners to move their savings from tax-exempt state and municipal bonds to taxable, higher yield industrial stocks.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), pp. 287–288&lt;/ref&gt; Though much of the tax plan that he proposed had been developed by former Wilson administration officials [[Russell Cornell Leffingwell]] and [[Seymour Parker Gilbert]], the press generally referred to it as the "Mellon Plan."&lt;ref name="murnane820822"&gt;Murnane (2004), pp. 820–822&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Revenue Act of 1918]] had set a top marginal income tax rate of 73% and a corporate tax of approximately 10%. Due in part to the size of the U.S. public debt, which had grown from $1 billion before the war to $24 billion in 1921, the provisions of the Revenue Act of 1918 remained in place when Harding took office. In 1921, the Treasury Department and the [[United States House Committee on Ways and Means|House Ways and Means Committee]] jointly prepared a bill setting the top marginal rate at the level advocated by Mellon, but opposition in the Senate from progressives like Senator [[Robert M. La Follette]] limited the size of the tax cuts. In November 1921, Congress passed and Harding signed the [[Revenue Act of 1921]], which raised personal [[tax exemption]]s and lowered the top marginal tax rate to 58%.&lt;ref&gt;Murnane (2004), pp. 824–829&lt;/ref&gt; Because it differed from his original proposals, Mellon was displeased by the bill.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), p. 288&lt;/ref&gt; He also strongly disapproved of a "Bonus Bill" passed by Congress that would provide for additional compensation to veterans of World War I, partly because he feared it would interfere with his plans to reduce debt and taxes. With Mellon's support, Harding vetoed the bill, and Congress failed to override the veto.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), pp. 288–289&lt;/ref&gt;

===Coolidge administration===
{{see also|Presidency of Calvin Coolidge}}
[[File:Calvin Coolidge, bw head and shoulders photo portrait seated, 1919.jpg|thumb|President [[Calvin Coolidge]] favored Mellon's economic policies]]

As the economy recovered from recession and began to experience the prosperity of the [[Roaring Twenties]], Mellon emerged as one of the most renowned figures in the Harding administration. One admiring congressman referred to Mellon as the "greatest Secretary of the Treasury since [[Alexander Hamilton]]."&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), pp. 309–310&lt;/ref&gt; Harding died after suffering a stroke in August 1923, and he was succeeded by Vice President [[Calvin Coolidge]]. Mellon enjoyed closer relations with President Coolidge than he had with President Harding, and Coolidge and Mellon shared similar views on most major issues, including on the necessity for further tax cuts.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), pp. 311–315&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Allen White]], a contemporary journalist, stated that "so completely did Andrew Mellon dominate the White House in the days when the Coolidge administration was at its zenith that it would be fair to call the administration the reign of Coolidge and Mellon."&lt;ref name="Keller 1982, p. 777"&gt;Keller (1982), p. 777&lt;/ref&gt;

Coolidge, Mellon, business organizations, and administration allies conducted a publicity campaign designed to convince wavering congressmen to support Mellon's tax plan.&lt;ref name="murnane833836840841"/&gt; Their efforts were opposed by the coalition of Democrats and progressive Republicans that exercised effective control over the [[68th United States Congress|68th Congress]].&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), p. 315&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1924, the House Ways and Means Committee approved of a bill based on Mellon's plan, but an alliance of progressive Republicans and Democrats engineered passage of an alternative tax bill written by Democrat [[John Nance Garner]]; Garner's plan also reduced income taxes, but set the top marginal tax rate at 46% rather than Mellon's preferred 33%. In June 1924, Coolidge signed the [[Revenue Act of 1924]], which contained the income tax rates of Garner's bill and also increased the [[Estate tax in the United States|estate tax]]. Coolidge signed the bill but simultaneously called for further tax cuts.&lt;ref name="murnane833836840841"&gt;Murnane (2004), pp. 833–836, 840–841&lt;/ref&gt; Congress also rejected Mellon's proposed constitutional amendment that would have barred the issuance of tax-exempt securities and, over Coolidge's veto, authorized a bonus to World War I veterans. Mellon did, however, win one legislative victory, as he convinced Congress to create the [[United States Tax Court|Board of Tax Appeals]] to adjudicate disputes between taxpayers and the government.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), pp. 315–316&lt;/ref&gt;

Mellon had originally planned to retire after one presidential term, but decided to remain in the cabinet in the hope of presiding over the full enactment of his taxation proposals.&lt;ref&gt;Murray (1975), pp. 227–228&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[United States presidential election, 1924|1924 presidential election]], the Republicans campaigned on further tax cuts, while both the Democrats and third party candidate Robert La Follette denounced Mellon's tax proposals as "a device to relieve multi-millionaires at the expense of other taxpayers."&lt;ref&gt;Murnane (2004), p. 841&lt;/ref&gt; Buoyed by the strong economy, and overcoming the [[Presidency of Warren G. Harding#Administration scandals|scandals of the Harding years]], Mellon won re-election by a decisive margin.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), p. 317&lt;/ref&gt; Coolidge saw his own landslide re-election victory as a mandate to pursue his favored economic policies, including further tax cuts.&lt;ref name="Keller 1982, p. 777"/&gt;

When Congress reconvened after the 1924 elections, it immediately began working on another bill designed to reduce taxes on the highest earners.&lt;ref&gt;Murnane (2004), p. 851&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1926, Coolidge signed the [[Revenue Act of 1926]], which reduced the top marginal rate to 25%. Mellon was extremely pleased by the passage of the act, because, unlike the Revenue Act of 1921 and the Revenue Act of 1924, the Revenue Act of 1926 closely reflected Mellon's proposals. In addition to cutting taxes on top earners, the act also raised the personal exemption for federal income taxes, abolished the [[Gift tax in the United States|gift tax]], reduced the estate tax rate, and repealed a provision that had required the public disclosure of federal income tax returns. Meanwhile, the booming economy fostered a $400 million budget surplus in 1926, and the country's national debt dropped from $24 billion in early 1921 to $19.6 billion at the end of fiscal year 1926.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), pp. 317–318&lt;/ref&gt;

With his top priority of tax reform accomplished, Mellon increasingly turned over management of the Treasury Department to his deputy, [[Ogden L. Mills]].&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), p. 355&lt;/ref&gt; After the 1926 elections, Mellon and Mills sought to cut the corporate tax and fully repeal the estate tax. The [[Revenue Act of 1928]] did indeed cut the corporate tax, but the estate tax was left unchanged.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), pp. 357–358&lt;/ref&gt; Mellon also focused on the construction of new federal buildings, and his efforts led to the construction of several buildings in the [[Federal Triangle]].&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), pp. 372–375&lt;/ref&gt; In 1928, Mellon stated that "in no other nation, and at no other time in the history of the world, have so many people enjoyed such a high degree of prosperity or maintained a standard of living comparable to that which prevails throughout this country today."&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), p. 364&lt;/ref&gt;

Responsibility for foreign relations lay with the State Department rather than the Treasury Department, and the [[Benjamin Strong Jr.]] and other central bankers took the lead with regard to international monetary policy, but Mellon nonetheless exercised some influenced in foreign affairs.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), p. 279&lt;/ref&gt; He strongly opposed the cancellation of European debts from World War I, but recognized that Britain and other countries would be unable to pay those debts without a renegotiation of terms. In 1923, Mellon and British [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] [[Stanley Baldwin]] negotiated an agreement in which Britain promised to pay off the debts over a 62-year period.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), pp. 289–290&lt;/ref&gt; After the adoption of the [[Dawes Plan]], Mellon reached debt settlements with several other European countries. After protracted negotiations, the United States and France agreed to the [[Mellon-Berenger Agreement]], which reduced France's debt and set terms for repayment.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), pp. 319–321&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hoover administration===
{{see also|Presidency of Herbert Hoover}}
[[File:andrew mellon stamp.JPG|right|thumb|Mellon on US stamp]]

====1928 election====

Coolidge surprised many observers by announcing that he would not seek another term in August 1927. The decision left Hoover as the presumed front-runner for the [[United States presidential election, 1928|1928 presidential election]], but many conservatives within the party opposed Hoover's candidacy. The conservative resistance to Hoover centered around Mellon, who controlled Pennsylvania's delegation at the [[1928 Republican National Convention]] and was influential with Republicans throughout the country. Though they had maintained an amicable relationship in public, Mellon privately distrusted Hoover, resented Hoover's engagement in the affairs of other cabinet departments, and feared that a President Hoover would move away from Mellon's tax policies. Several Republicans urged Mellon to run for president, but Mellon believed that he was too old to seek the presidency. Mellon attempted to convince Coolidge or Charles Evans Hughes to run, but neither heeded his appeals.&lt;ref&gt;Rusnak (1983), pp. 269–272&lt;/ref&gt; In the months before the 1928 Republican Convention, Mellon maintained his neutrality in the presidential race, but with no compelling alternative Republican candidate willing to run, Mellon finally threw his support behind Hoover. With Mellon's backing, Hoover won the Republican nomination on the first ballot of the convention, and he went on to defeat [[Al Smith]] in the [[United States presidential election, 1928|1928 presidential election]].&lt;ref&gt;Rusnak (1983), pp. 274–276&lt;/ref&gt; Defying widespread expectations that he would retire, Mellon chose to stay on as Secretary of the Treasury.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), pp. 379–380&lt;/ref&gt; Along with Secretary of Agriculture [[James Wilson (Secretary of Agriculture)|James Wilson]] and Secretary of Labor [[James J. Davis]], Mellon is one of only three cabinet members to serve in the same post under three consecutive presidents.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

====Great Depression====
[[File:Andrew W. Mellon Ogden Mills.jpg|thumb|Mellon and his successor as Secretary of the Treasury, [[Ogden L. Mills]]]]

Secretary Mellon had helped persuade the Federal Reserve Board to lower interest rates in 1921 and 1924; lower interest rates contributed to a booming economy, but they also encouraged stock market [[speculation]].&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), pp. 286, 321&lt;/ref&gt; In 1928, responding to increasing fears of the dangers of speculation and a booming stock market, the Federal Reserve Board began raising interest rates.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), p. 359&lt;/ref&gt; Mellon favored another interest rate increase in 1929, and in August 1929 the Federal Reserve Board raised the discount rate to six percent. The higher rate failed to curb speculation, and the activity on the stock market continued to grow.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), pp. 388–390&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1929, the [[New York Stock Exchange]] suffered the worst crash in its history in what was called "[[Wall Street Crash of 1929|Black Tuesday]]." As the vast majority of Americans did not own shares in the stock market, the crash did not immediately have disastrous effects on the U.S. economy as a whole. Mellon had little sympathy for the speculators who lost their money, and he was philosophically opposed to an interventionist economic policy designed to address the stock market crash. Nonetheless, Mellon immediately began calling for cuts to the discount rate, which would reach two percent in mid-1930, and successfully urged Congress to pass a bill providing for temporary, across-the-board tax cuts.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), pp. 391–395&lt;/ref&gt;

By mid-1930, many, including Mellon, believed that the economy had already experienced the worst effects of the stock market crash. He did not object to the [[Smoot–Hawley Tariff Act]], which raised tariff rates to one of the highest levels in U.S. history.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), pp. 395–397&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the optimism of Hoover and Mellon, in late 1930 the economy went into a deep slump, as gross national product declined dramatically and numerous workers lost their jobs. While numerous banks failed, Democrats won control of Congress in the [[United States elections, 1930|1930 mid-term elections]]. As the economy declined, so did Mellon's popularity, which was further damaged by his opposition to another bonus bill for veterans.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), pp. 399–401&lt;/ref&gt; In mid-1931, the country entered a deep depression and, at Hoover's request, Mellon negotiated a moratorium on German debt repayments. After Mellon returned to the United States in August 1931, he was confronted by another series of bank failures. Among the banks that failed was the Bank of Pittsburgh, the lone remaining major Pittsburgh bank not controlled by the Mellon family. Again following Hoover's lead, Mellon presided over the creation of the National Credit Association, a voluntary initiative among the larger banks that was designed to assist failing institutions. As the National Credit Association proved to be ineffective at stemming the tide of bank failures, Congress and the Hoover administration established the [[Reconstruction Finance Corporation]] to provide federal loans to banks.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), pp. 437–443&lt;/ref&gt;

With the unemployment rate approaching twenty percent, Mellon became one of the most "loathed leaders" in the United States, second only to Hoover himself.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), pp. 442–444&lt;/ref&gt; Facing this unprecedented economic catastrophe, Mellon urged Hoover to refrain from using the government to intervene in the depression. Mellon believed that economic recessions, such as those that had occurred in 1873 and 1907, were a necessary part of the business cycle because they purged the economy, which in turn would lead to a situation in which "people will work harder, lead a more moral life."&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), pp. 444–445&lt;/ref&gt; Facing a large deficit, Mellon and Mills called for a return to the tax rates set by the Revenue Act of 1924, and also sought new taxes on automobiles, gasoline, and other items. Congress responded by passing the [[Revenue Act of 1932]], which included many of Treasury Department's proposals.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), pp. 448–449&lt;/ref&gt; In early 1932, Congressman [[Wright Patman]] of Texas initiated [[Impeachment in the United States|impeachment]] proceedings against Mellon, contending that Mellon had violated numerous federal laws designed to prevent conflicts of interest. Though Mellon had defeated similar investigations in the past, his falling popularity left him unable to effectively counter Patman's charges. Hoover removed Mellon from Washington by offering him the position of [[List of ambassadors of the United States to the United Kingdom|ambassador to the United Kingdom]]. Mellon accepted the post, and Mills replaced his former boss as Secretary of the Treasury.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), pp. 450–452&lt;/ref&gt;

Mellon arrived in Britain in April 1932, receiving a friendly reception from a country he had often visited over the previous thirty years.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), pp. 455–456&lt;/ref&gt; From his post, he watched the collapse of the international economic order, including the debt accords that he had helped negotiate. He also convinced the British to allow Gulf Oil to operate in [[Kuwait]], a British protectorate in the oil-rich region of the [[Persian Gulf]]. Defying Mellon's expectations, Hoover was defeated by [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] in the [[United States presidential election, 1932|1932 presidential election]].&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), pp. 459–461, 463–464&lt;/ref&gt; Mellon left office when Hoover's term ended in March 1933, returning to private life after twelve years of government service.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), p. 468&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pennsylvania politics, 1921–1933===

Knox and Penrose both died in 1921, leaving a power vacuum in Pennsylvania Republican politics. Along with his nephew, William Larimer Mellon, Mellon became an influential player in Pennsylvania politics, and their support helped ensure the elections of Senator [[David A. Reed]] and Senator [[George W. Pepper]] in 1922.&lt;ref&gt;Murray (1975), pp. 224–227&lt;/ref&gt; Mellon was unable to assert the same level of control that Boies Penrose had had over state politics, and his leadership of the state party was challenged by [[William Scott Vare]] of Philadelphia and progressive leader [[Gifford Pinchot]], who won the 1922 Pennsylvania gubernatorial election.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), pp. 294–295&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, Mellon would continue to exert an important influence on Pennsylvania politics throughout the 1920s, especially in senatorial elections and in Allegheny County.&lt;ref&gt;Murray (1975), pp. 231–233&lt;/ref&gt; Mellon's influence over state politics waned in the early 1930s, as the progressive allies of Governor Pinchot took control of the state Republican Party.&lt;ref&gt;Murray (1975), p. 240&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==

Numerous financial institutions failed in the months prior to Roosevelt's inauguration, but Mellon National Bank, the Union Trust Company, and another Mellon banking operation, Mellbank Corporation, were all able to avoid closure.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), pp. 466–468&lt;/ref&gt; Mellon strongly opposed Roosevelt's [[New Deal]] policies, especially the [[1933 Banking Act]], which required a separation between commercial and investment banking.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), pp. 478–480&lt;/ref&gt; Mellon believed that the various New Deal policies, including [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] and [[Unemployment benefits|unemployment insurance]], undermined the free market system that had produced one of the largest economies in the world. Aside from banking reform, other New Deal policies, including regulations on utilities and coal mines and laws designed to promote labor unions, also affected Mellon's business empire. Additionally, the [[Revenue Act of 1934]] and the [[Revenue Act of 1935]] rescinded many of Mellon's tax policies and contained other provisions that were designed to increase taxation on top earners and corporations.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), pp. 518–522&lt;/ref&gt;

Even after leaving office, Mellon continued to be vilified by many in the public, and in 1933 [[Harvey O'Connor]] published a popular and unfavorable biography, ''Mellon's Millions''.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), pp. 485–486&lt;/ref&gt; Democrats won effective control of Allegheny County in the 1933 elections, and the following year Democrat [[Joseph F. Guffey]] won Pennsylvania's Senate election and [[George Howard Earle III]] won the state's gubernatorial election.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), pp. 487–489&lt;/ref&gt; Mellon endured numerous attacks during these campaigns, and his unpopularity in Pittsburgh led him to spend most of his final years in Washington rather than his home town.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), pp. 490–491&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1930s, the Roosevelt administration conducted several high-profile tax evasion prosecutions against individuals such as [[Thomas W. Lamont]] and [[Jimmy Walker]].&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), pp. 514–515&lt;/ref&gt; In response to accusations levied by Republican Congressman [[Louis Thomas McFadden]] of Pennsylvania in early 1933, Attorney General [[Homer Cummings]] began an inquiry into Mellon's tax history.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), pp. 507–509&lt;/ref&gt; Between February 1935 and May 1936, the Board of Tax Appeals heard a widely covered case in which the federal government accused Mellon of tax fraud. During the proceedings, Mellon divulged numerous details of his business career that had previously been unknown to the public.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), pp. 525–528&lt;/ref&gt;

Mellon was diagnosed with cancer in November 1936.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), p. 558&lt;/ref&gt; His health declined in 1937, and he died on August 26, 1937. Newspapers across the country took note of his death. Secretary of the Treasury [[Henry Morgenthau Jr.]] stated that Mellon had lived through "an epoch in the economic history of the nation, and his passing takes one of the most important industrial and financial figures of our time."&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), pp. 573, 578–581&lt;/ref&gt; Mellon was buried at Trinity Episcopal Church Cemetery, [[Upperville, Virginia]].{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} Months after Mellon's death, the Board of Tax appeals handed down a ruling exonerating Mellon of all tax fraud charges.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), pp. 583–584&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==

In the early 1880s, Mellon had a serious relationship with Fannie Larimer Jones, but he broke off the relationship after learning that she was suffering from [[tuberculosis]]. After this experience, Mellon refrained from courting women for several years.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), pp. 77–78&lt;/ref&gt; In 1898, while traveling with Frick and Frick's wife to Europe, Mellon met Nora McMullen, a nineteen-year-old Englishwoman of Ulster Scots ancestry. Mellon visited McMullen's home of [[Hertford Castle]] in 1898 and 1899, and, after a period of courtship, Nora married Mellon in 1900.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), pp. 142–148, 151&lt;/ref&gt; Nora gave birth to a daughter, [[Ailsa Mellon Bruce|Ailsa]], in 1901.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), p. 155,&lt;/ref&gt; Nora disliked living in Pittsburgh, and she was unhappy in her marriage.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), pp. 152, 156&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of 1903, she had begun an affair with Alfred George Curphey, who would also later be involved with the wife of [[George Vivian, 4th Baron Vivian]].&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), pp. 168–172, 191&lt;/ref&gt; Mellon and Nora eventually reconciled, and in 1907 she gave birth to a son, [[Paul Mellon|Paul]].&lt;ref name="Cannadine 2006, p. 184"/&gt; The reconciliation proved short-lived, as Nora took up with Curphey again in 1908 and requested a divorce the following year.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), pp. 193, 196&lt;/ref&gt; In order to avoid a public scandal, Andrew reluctantly agreed to a separation in 1909.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), pp. 197–198&lt;/ref&gt; Seeking to hold divorce proceedings privately before a judge rather than publicly before a jury, in 1911 Mellon convinced the Pennsylvania legislature to amend a law that had required a [[jury trial]] in divorce proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), pp. 205–206&lt;/ref&gt; In response, Nora attacked Mellon in the press, and the divorce proceedings were widely covered by the media. In 1912, Mellon and Nora finally agreed on a divorce settlement, largely on Mellon's terms.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), pp. 207–211&lt;/ref&gt;

Mellon did not remarry. Nora lived in Pittsburgh for several years before eventually settling in the [[Hudson Valley]], and the two children alternated living with either parent.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), pp. 264, 304&lt;/ref&gt; In 1923, Nora married Harvey Arthur Lee, a British-born antiques dealer 14 years her junior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=11 June 1928 |title=Milestones: Jun. 11, 1928 |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,881064,00.html |work=[[Time (magazine)|TIME]] }} ''www.time.com.''

In 1926, in the "greatest society event that the nation's capital had witnessed" since before World War I, Ailsa married [[David K. E.

[[File:Mellon Institute 01.JPG|right|thumb|Mellon Institute of Industrial Research]]

Emulating his father, Mellon eschewed [[philanthropy]] for much of his life, but in the early 1900s he began donating to local organizations such as the [[YMCA]]. Mellon committed to his first large-scale act of philanthropy in 1913, when he and his brother, Richard, established the [[Mellon Institute of Industrial Research]] as a department of the University of Pittsburgh.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), pp. 238–241&lt;/ref&gt; In 1965, the institute merged with the Carnegie Institute of Technology to form [[Carnegie Mellon University]]. Mellon also served as an alumni president&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://digital.library.pitt.edu:80/cgi-bin/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=pittyearbooks;cc=pittyearbooks;g=documentingpitt;xc=1;xg=1;q1=Andrew%20W.%20Mellon;rgn=full%20text;idno=1937e49702;didno=1937e49702;view=image;seq=0037 |title=The 1937 Owl |year=1937 |page=32 |publisher=University of Pittsburgh |accessdate=2009-06-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and trustee&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://digital.library.pitt.edu:80/cgi-bin/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=pittmiscpubs;cc=pittmiscpubs;g=documentingpitt;xc=1;xg=1;q1=Andrew%20W.%20Mellon;rgn=full%20text;idno=00c50130m;didno=00c50130m;view=image;seq=0067 |last=Alberts |first=Robert C. |title=Pitt: The Story of the University of Pittsburgh 1787–1987 |page=47 |year=1986 |isbn=0-8229-1150-7 |publisher=University of Pittsburgh Press |accessdate=2009-06-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; of the University of Pittsburgh, and made several major donations to the school, including the land on which the [[Cathedral of Learning]] and [[Heinz Chapel]] were constructed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://digital.library.pitt.edu:80/cgi-bin/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=pittmiscpubs;cc=pittmiscpubs;g=documentingpitt;xc=1;xg=1;q1=Andrew%20W.%20Mellon;rgn=full%20text;idno=00afj8718m;didno=00afj8718m;view=image;seq=0314 |last=Starrett |first=Agnes Lynch |title=Through one hundred and fifty years: the University of Pittsburgh |page=256  |year=1937 |publisher=University of Pittsburgh Press |accessdate=2009-06-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In total it is estimated that Mellon donated over $43 million to the University of Pittsburgh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://digital.library.pitt.edu/cgi-bin/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=pittmiscpubs;cc=pittmiscpubs;idno=00c50130m;didno=00c50130m;view=image;seq=201|last=Alberts |first=Robert C. |title=Pitt: The Story of the University of Pittsburgh 1787–1987 |page=182 |year=1986 |isbn=0-8229-1150-7 |publisher=University of Pittsburgh Press |accessdate=2009-06-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Encouraged by Frick, and guided by [[Charles Carstairs]]. Mellon began collecting art in the mid-to-late 1890s.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), pp. 130–131&lt;/ref&gt; Over the ensuing decades, his art collection continued to grow as he purchased pieces from [[Knoedler]] and [[Joseph Duveen, 1st Baron Duveen|Joseph Duveen]], and during the 1920s his personal collection was generally considered to be one of the finest art collections in Washington.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), pp. 323–324&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1930s, he purchased, according to Cannadine, just under half of the "greatest paintings" from the [[Soviet Union]]'s [[Hermitage Museum]] in the [[Soviet sale of Hermitage paintings]].&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), pp. 416–425&lt;/ref&gt;  [[List of original Hermitage paintings in the National Gallery of Art|Twenty-one paintings]], of the highest quality, were later given to the National Gallery of Art.

Mellon decided to use his personal fortune and art collection to establish a national art museum in Washington modeled after the [[National Gallery]] in London.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), p. 539&lt;/ref&gt; In 1936, Mellon presented President Roosevelt with an offer to establish a national art museum to which Mellon would donate his art collection as well as an endowment, while the federal government would pay for the institution's upkeep. He conditioned the offer on the establishment of a board of trustees, a majority of whom would be chosen by Mellon. Despite the ongoing tax case against Mellon, the Roosevelt administration accepted the offer, and Congress passed legislation authorizing the construction of the [[National Gallery of Art]] on Mellon's terms.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), pp. 559–566&lt;/ref&gt; The National Gallery of Art opened in 1941 and continues to operate.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), p. 589&lt;/ref&gt; Mellon's friend and former employee, [[David E. Finley Jr.]], would later preside over the establishment of the [[National Portrait Gallery (United States)|National Portrait Gallery]], which also hosts several paintings donated by Mellon.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), p. 594&lt;/ref&gt;

Mellon was initiated to the [[Scottish Rite]] Freemasonry&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = | url = https://pub.acgl.eu/index.php/freemasonry/information |  title = Famous men members of Masonic Lodges | website = American Canadian Grand Lodge ACGL | language = en | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20181117142833/https://pub.acgl.eu/index.php/freemasonry/information | archive-date = Nov 17, 2018 | deadurl = no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.bavarialodge.org/freemasonry | title = Famous members of Masonic Lodges | language = en | website = Bavaria Lodge No. 935 A.F. &amp; A.

==Legacy==
===Memorials===
The [[Andrew W. Mellon Memorial Fountain]] in Washington was created by [[Sidney Waugh]] and was dedicated in May 1952 by [[Harry S. Truman]].&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), p. 593&lt;/ref&gt; Washington, D.C. also hosts the [[Andrew W. Mellon Auditorium]] and the [[Andrew Mellon Building]]. The [[Andrew W. Mellon Foundation]], the product of the merger of the Avalon Foundation and the Old Dominion Foundation (set up separately by his children), is named in his honor, as is the 378-foot [[USCGC Mellon (WHEC-717)|US Coast Guard Cutter ''Mellon (WHEC-717)'']].

===In popular culture===
Andrew W. Mellon appears in the [[HBO]] drama series ''[[Boardwalk Empire]]'', in the fifth, eighth and twelfth episodes of the third season, in his capacity as Secretary of the Treasury.  His character is played by [[Carnegie Mellon]] alumnus [[James Cromwell]].

In the [[alternate history]]/[[time travel]] story "A Slip in Time" by [[S. M. Stirling]],&lt;ref&gt;Published in "Multiverse:Exploring [[Poul Anderson]]'s worlds, edited by [[Greg Bear]] and [[Gardner Dozois]], [[Subterranean Press]], Boston, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; featuring a history in which the [[First World War]] was avoided and the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]] survived, Andrew Mellon was the [[President of the United States]] in 1926.

[[File:Anguilla-aerial view western portion.jpg|thumb|right|Anguilla.]]

'''Anguillan bankruptcy law''' regulates the position of individuals and companies who are unable to meet their financial obligations.

Bankruptcy of individuals is usually referred to as "[[personal bankruptcy]]" in [[Anguilla]], whereas the bankruptcy of corporations is referred to as "[[corporate insolvency]]".  The legislation largely deals with both separately, although there are some common provisions.

==Personal bankruptcy==

Personal bankruptcy is regulated under the Bankruptcy Act (Cap B.15).  Under that statute, a person commits an [[act of bankruptcy]] if he or she:&lt;ref&gt;Bankruptcy Act, section 4.&lt;/ref&gt;
# makes a conveyance or [[assignment (law)|assignment]] of his property to a [[trustee]] or trustees for the benefit of his creditors generally;
# makes a [[fraudulent conveyance]], gift, delivery, or transfer of his property, or any part thereof;
# makes any conveyance or transfer of his property, or any part thereof, or creates any charge thereon, which would under this or any other Act be void as a [[fraudulent preference]] if he were adjudged bankrupt;
# with intent to defeat or delay his creditors he departs out of Anguilla, or being out of Anguilla remains out of Anguilla, or departs from his dwelling house, or otherwise absents himself, or begins to keep house;
# execution having issued against him, has been levied by seizure and sale of his goods under process in an action in any court, or in any civil proceeding;
# if any judgment debt has been ordered by the Court to be levied upon any lands&lt;ref&gt;Other than a plantation in which there are 40 acres under cultivation&lt;/ref&gt; or any mortgage, encumbrance or interest in or upon such land;
# files in the Court a declaration of his inability to pay his debts, or presents a bankruptcy petition against himself or herself;
# if a creditor has obtained a final judgment against him for any amount, and execution thereon not having been stayed, and he does not, within the time provided, either comply with the requirements of the notice, or satisfy the Court that he has a counterclaim, set off or cross demand which equals or exceeds the amount of the judgment debt;
# if the debtor gives notice to any of his creditors that he has suspended, or that he is about to suspend, payment of his debts; or
# if the debtor has in fact suspended payment of his debts and given notice to any of his creditors that he is insolvent.

If any of those conditions are made out, then the court may make a "receiving order" (which is the name for what is ordinarily called a bankruptcy order in Anguilla).&lt;ref&gt;Bankruptcy Act, section 5.&lt;/ref&gt;  On the making of a receiving order a receiver is constituted "receiver" of the property of the debtor, and thereafter no creditor to whom the debtor is indebted in respect of any debt provable in bankruptcy shall have any remedy against the debtor in respect of the debt or shall commence any action or other legal proceedings unless with the leave of the Court, and on such terms as the Court may impose.&lt;ref&gt;Bankruptcy Act, section 9(1).&lt;/ref&gt;  Thereafter a meeting of creditors is convened,&lt;ref&gt;Bankruptcy Act, section 14.&lt;/ref&gt; and they may by resolution of 75% of creditors in value seek to implement an arrangement or compromise in relation to the debts of the bankrupt.&lt;ref&gt;Bankruptcy Act, section 17.&lt;/ref&gt;  If the meeting is not successful in implementing a scheme, then the court will appoint a [[trustee in bankruptcy]] who will divide the property of the bankrupt between his creditors in the discharge of their claims.&lt;ref&gt;Bankruptcy Act, sections 19 and 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Corporate insovlency==

Anguillan corporate insolvency law is presently highly fragmented, with various different parts of appearing in either the Bankruptcy Act (Cap B.15) or the Companies Act (Cap C.65).  However, the matrix of laws is nonetheless fragmentary and incomplete.  At present there are no provisions under Anguillan law in relation to corporate insolvency which address insolvency set-off, or the avoidance of dispositions after the commencement of winding-up.  There are also no powers conferred upon the [[liquidator (law)|liquidator]] specifically relating to challenging transactions entered into the "twilight" period which prejudice the general body of creditors, but there is limited scope to seek redress for such transactions outside of the insolvency regime under the Fraudulent Dispositions Act (Cap F.60).

However, the legislature is currently considering a comprehensive new Insolvency Act which will both close all of the relevant gaps in the law, and consolidate all related laws relating to both corporate insolvency and personal bankruptcy into a single statute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.harneys.com/publications/legal-updates/anguilla-publishes-draft-bill-for-new-insolvency-legislation|title=Anguilla publishes draft bill for new insolvency legislation|publisher=[[Harney Westwood &amp; Riegels]]|date=25 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Where a liquidator over a company is appointed (either voluntarily or by the court), the liquidator's primary duty is to collect in all of the company's assets and then distribute them ''[[pari passu]]'' to the company's creditors.  The law confers wide powers upon the liquidator to enable him to do so.  Once a liquidator is appointed, [[unsecured creditor]]s cannot commence legal proceedings against the insolvent company without the leave of the court, and any rights of action against the company are converted into claims in the liquidation process.  Any disposition of property by the company after the commencement of winding-up is void unless the court otherwise orders.

[[Secured creditor]]s generally do not participate in the liquidation process, and may continue to proceed with any enforcement action directly against their collateral pursuant to a valid [[security interest]].

Anguillan law provides for statutory [[netting]] relating to financial contracts under the Netting Act (Cap N.03), and this will prevail over any other off provisions arising by law.&lt;ref&gt;Netting Act, section 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''William H.''' ('''Bill''') '''Inmon''' (born 1945) is an American [[computer scientist]], recognized by many as the father of the [[data warehouse]].&lt;ref&gt;Jill Dyché (2000). ''e-Data: turning data into information with data warehousing''. Addison-Wesley. p.323.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Factor (2001). ''Analyzing Application Service Providers''. Prentice Hall PTR. p.290.&lt;/ref&gt; Inmon wrote the first book, held the first conference (with [[Arnie Barnett]]), wrote the first column in a magazine and was the first to offer classes in [[data warehousing]]. Inmon created the accepted definition of what a data warehouse is - a subject oriented, nonvolatile, integrated, time variant collection of data in support of management's decisions. Compared with the approach of the other pioneering architect of data warehousing, [[Ralph Kimball]], Inmon's approach is often characterized as a top-down approach.

== Biography ==
William H. Inmon was born July 20, 1945 in [[San Diego, California]]. He received his [[Bachelor of Science]] degree in [[mathematics]] from [[Yale University]], and his [[Master of Science]] degree in [[computer science]] from [[New Mexico State University]].

He worked for [[American Management Systems]] and [[Coopers &amp; Lybrand]] before 1991, when he founded the company Prism Solutions, which he took public. In 1995 he founded Pine Cone Systems, which was renamed Ambeo later on. In 1999, he created a corporate information factory web site for his consulting business.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inmoncif.com/about/ About Bill : William H. Inmon, "The Father of Data Warehousing"]. Inmon Consulting Services 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Inmon coined terms such as the government information factory, as well as data warehousing 2.0.  Inmon promotes building, usage, and maintenance of data warehouses and related topics. His books include "Building the Data Warehouse" (1992, with later editions) and "DW 2.0: The Architecture for the Next Generation of Data Warehousing" (2008).

In July 2007, Inmon was named by [[Computerworld]] as one of the ten people that most influenced the first 40 years of the computer industry.&lt;ref&gt;Computer World Magazine's July 2007 issue.&lt;/ref&gt;

Inmon's association with data warehousing stems from the fact that he wrote the first{{cn|date=December 2015}} book on data warehousing he held the first conference on data warehousing (with Arnie Barnett), he wrote the first column in a magazine on data warehousing, he has written over 1,000 articles on data warehousing in journals and newsletters, he created the first fold out wall chart for data warehousing and he conducted the first classes on data warehousing. 

In 2012, Inmon developed and made public technology known as "textual disambiguation". Textual disambiguation applies context to raw text and reformats the raw text and context into a standard data base format. Once raw text is passed through textual disambiguation, it can easily and efficiently be accessed and analyzed by standard business intelligence technology. Textual disambiguation is accomplished through the execution of textual ETL.

In 2017, KDNuggets, a leading Data Science platform, published his article on "Hearing the Voices of your Customer". He was also interviewed in "Data Podcast" by Rajib Bahar, &amp; Shabnam Khan about his latest work and how Big Data fits in the world of Data-warehousing.

'''Booker T. Washington High School for the Performing and Visual Arts''' is a [[state school|public]] [[secondary school]] located in the [[Arts District, Dallas|Arts District]] of [[downtown Dallas|downtown]] [[Dallas, Texas|Dallas]], [[Texas]] ([[United States|USA]]).  Booker T. Washington HSPVA enrolls students in [[Educational stages|grades]] [[ninth grade|9]]-[[twelfth grade|12]] and is the [[Dallas Independent School District]]'s arts [[magnet school]] (thus, it is often locally referred to simply as '''Arts Magnet'''). Many accomplished performers and artists have been educated in the school. Some examples include [[Ernie Banks]], [[Norah Jones]], [[Erykah Badu]], [[Adario Strange]], [[Valarie Rae Miller]], [[Edie Brickell]], [[Kennedy Davenport]], [[Sandra St. Victor]], [[Roy Hargrove]], and [[Scott Westerfeld]].

==History==
[[Image:Booker T. Washington High School for the Performing and Visual Arts.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Booker T. Washington High School for the Performing and Visual Arts]]
In 1892, Dallas established its first [[high school]] for [[African American]] pupils. In 1911, the school was enlarged and named the '''Dallas Colored High School'''. The school was moved in 1922 to larger quarters, designed by famed Dallas architects Lang &amp; Witchell, and renamed '''Booker T. Washington High School''', after the African-American education pioneer [[Booker T. Washington]]. For many years, it was the only Dallas high school that allowed students of color.

In 1939, Wilmer-Hutchins Colored High School of the [[Wilmer-Hutchins Independent School District|Wilmer-Hutchins ISD]] burned down in a fire. Afterwards, African-American WHISD students were sent to DISD high schools for "colored" people such as Washington.&lt;ref name="Grandma"&gt;{{cite web|last=Benton |first=Joshua |title=A family on both sides of district’s demise; Pioneer fought to save W-H; granddaughter cast key vote to close it |publisher=''[[The Dallas Morning News]]'' |page=1A |url=http://www.clipfile.org/2005/07/15/797/ |date=2005-07-15 |accessdate=2009-08-22 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928054515/http://www.clipfile.org/2005/07/15/797/ |archivedate=September 28, 2007 |df= }} ()&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1942, teacher Thelma Paige Richardson sued the Dallas School District, demanding equalization of pay based upon tenure and merit; the school district denied that any discrimination was taking place. Richardson, with the help of the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People|NAACP]], won the case, increasing general awareness of [[discrimination]] in the public school system.

In 1952, it was enlarged yet again, and given the new name as Booker T. Washington Technical High School.

In 1976, the school was repurposed as the Arts Magnet at Booker T. Washington High School, inheriting and expanding the magnet-school arts curriculum that had been in place in the Performing Arts Cluster at [[Skyline High School (Dallas, Texas)|Skyline High School]] since 1970.  The Arts Magnet would become a prototype for magnet schools across the country.  The repurposing was part of the Federal Court Desegregation Orders that created the Magnet School system in Dallas ISD (''Tasby v. Estes''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://library.law.smu.edu/Collections/DISD|title=Desegregating Dallas Schools: Tasby v. Estes|last=|first=|date=|website=SMU Underwood Law Library|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;'')''.  [[Paul Baker (teacher)|Paul Baker]] was selected by Superintendent Estes has Founding Director of the School.

In 2008, the building was enlarged a third time. After receiving many grants, the school underwent a $65,000,000 expansion. [https://web.archive.org/web/20080513200847/http://www.dallasperformingarts.org/news-1.22.08.html].

The surrounding neighborhood has evolved into the [[Arts District, Dallas, Texas|Dallas Arts District]] and the school building is an official [[Dallas Landmark]].

In 2008, a new $65 million facility designed by [[Brad Cloepfil]], was completed. The main building, incorporated as an historical landmark, has been preserved.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13591">The '''Certified Public Manager₢''' (CPM) is a [[United States]] [[Professional certification|professional designation]] established in 1979 for the purpose of improving performance and advancing [[best practice]] standards for [[public sector]] managers. The CPM is a comprehensive [[management]] development program based upon a selected set of [https://web.archive.org/web/20121002043339/http://www.aspaonline.org/scpm/competencies.html competencies]. The CPM is awarded upon completion of a CPM program accredited by the National Certified Public Manager Consortium. CPM graduates come from public, private, and non-profit career fields.
The words "certified public manager" are registered service marks by the [[U.S.&amp;nbsp;Patent and Trademark Office]].

== Requirements ==

Requirements for the CPM vary by program, but all require at least 300&amp;nbsp;hours of training, including classes, application projects, structured readings, and examinations. Each CPM candidate is required to pass a series of courses centering on various management principles. The courses are designed around a set of core competencies and each CPM program requires an evaluation of all major [[curriculum|curricular]] competencies.

=== Curriculum competencies ===

The following competencies are present in all CPM curriculum:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CPM Curriculum)|url=http://www.cpmconsortium.org/Curriculum|publisher=National CPM Consortium|accessdate=10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|}

The structure of CPM competencies arise from a [[holistic]] approach to management. Communication, organizational management, and ethical principles are emphasized as well as financial responsibility and effective [[change management]]. [[System thinking]] is introduced within the CPM program to emphasize the importance of broad open system management within organization. The program also places importance on personal development and change leadership.

== History ==

The idea for the CPM began in the early 1970s at the [[University Of Georgia|University of Georgia]] with the realization that the state was experiencing explosive growth in information and knowledge, significant new social legislation, and rapidly altering social values. During this time the [[Carl Vinson Institute of Government]] and the Georgia [[Merit system|Merit System]] were offering management training to public employees. It was recognized that these two organizations were offering duplications of training in some areas of management and were failing to meet the needs of other management areas. In 1974 University of Georgia’s Institute of Government, the Georgia Center for Continuing Education, and the Georgia State Merit System for Personnel Administration convened to discuss ways to broaden and refine Georgia state management training programs to meet the challenges of rapid change in the state and society. A consensus was reached that management in the state government needed to become more professional.&lt;ref name=history&gt;{{cite book|last=Patterson|first=Thomas H.|title=The History of the Certified Public Manager|date=8 April 2003|publisher=American Academy of Certified Public Managers|pages=1–38|url=http://www.cpmacademy.org/publications/AACPM_History_20030329.pdf|accessdate=10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ken Henning is considered the father of the CPM. He observed that most state training programs consisted of separate courses in which content was varied and lacked consistent focus. Henning felt that an integrated program would achieve a more organized approach to competencies needed by management. The CPM&amp;nbsp;program was modeled after the [[Certified Public Accountant|CPA&amp;nbsp;program]], consisting of the creation of a coordinated program addressing specific and various training needs relevant to management as well as with content involving study and preparation, practice and application of learning, examination, and prestigious recognition. The CPM would also involve the eventual creation of the American Academy of Certified Public Managers similar to the [[American Institute of Certified Public Accountants]] as a central capstone organization.

Planners believed that awarding certificates of attendance were insufficient in the creation of a program based on quality. Early planners for the CPM determined that an innovative and rigorous program of study, application of knowledge, examination, and certification should be developed.  University courses and the Georgia Merit System collaborated to reduce training duplication, and maximize efforts. Initially a program was developed in which six courses would be taught, three by the Georgia Merit System and three by the University of Georgia.  
After a series of meetings, two long-term goals for the CPM were created:

* To achieve and subsequently to maintain a level of national recognition for the CPM&amp;nbsp;designation similar to that accorded the Certified Public Accountant&amp;nbsp;(CPA) designation; and
* To foster and encourage the highest possible levels of competence and ethical practice by managers in state and other levels of government through a national body of professionally trained and oriented Certified Public Managers.

After gathering strong support for the CPM program from the governor, legislative leadership, top management of state agencies, [http://www.uga.edu/ University of Georgia], regional intergovernmental personnel assistance (IPA) offices of the [[U.S.&amp;nbsp;Civil Service Commission]], the [http://www.cviog.uga.edu/ University of Georgia’s Institute for Government and Center for Continuing Education] and the [https://web.archive.org/web/20110708103007/http://gms.georgia.gov/00/article/0%2C2086%2C683909_6170_11788934%2C00.html Georgia State Merit System of Personnel Administration] co-authored a detailed proposal.

February&amp;nbsp;9,&amp;nbsp;1976 the [[Georgia House of Representatives]] passed Resolution Act No.&amp;nbsp;97 in response to [[George Busbee|Governor Busbee]]’s request authorizing and directing the State Personnel Board and the State Merit System of Personnel Administration to implement the Certified Public Manager Program in the State Government of Georgia. On February&amp;nbsp;19,&amp;nbsp;1976 the Senate adopted the resolution and the legislature unanimously passed the resolution on February&amp;nbsp;26,&amp;nbsp;1976. On March&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;nbsp;1976 the CPM was formally established.

In 1977 the Georgia Society of Public Managers was created affiliated with a national organization to be known as the American Academy of Certified Public Managers. In 1980 the National CPM Consortium was developed with the completion of its constitution. The National CPM Consortium included [[Arizona]], [[Florida]], [[Georgia (U.S. State)|Georgia]], [[Louisiana]], [[North Carolina]], and [[Vermont]]. The role of the CPM Consortium is to direct the general nature in which each program should operate, but it is not designed to dictate curriculum or administrative specifics for each program. Since then, the CPM program has expanded across the United States.

== National Certified Public Manager® Consortium ==

On October 6, 1980 the Certified Public Manager Board ratified the constitution of the [http://cpmconsoritum.org National Certified Public Manager® Consortium]. The Consortium is designed to monitor [[accreditation]] standards and facilitate program development of CPM programs around the nation.

== Program linkages ==

The CPM is linked with several professional organizations, including the [http://www.cpmacademy.org/ American Academy of Certified Public Managers], an organization for individuals with CPM accreditation and the [[American Society for Public Administration|American Society for Public Administration&amp;nbsp;(ASPA)]], which provides free membership for CPM graduates. Annually, the [[Texas]] CPM and ASPA host a CPM/ASPA conference. In 2007 a new ASPA section called the Section on Certified Public Management was created to promote professional development and training regarding ethical values and technical competencies associated with outstanding public service. In addition, the SCPM holds conferences, forums, seminars, and discussion events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The William P. Hobby Center for Public Service|url=http://www.txstate.edu/cpm/|publisher=Texas State University - San Marcos|accessdate=10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== International expansion ==

The contract for the CPM program at the Swedish National Defense College was signed along with the [[William&amp;nbsp;P.&amp;nbsp;Hobby]] Center for Public Service which is affiliated with [[Texas State University - San Marcos]] and the National CPM Consortium. The program in Sweden is viewed as the first step toward more international expansion of the CPM.

In 2015, [http://professionallearning.nl/en Leiden University Centre for Professional Learning] in the Netherlands was the first international program to become a member of the National Certified Public Manager Consortium and be granted Associate status.

In [[accounting]], the '''cost principle''' is part of the [[generally accepted accounting principles]]. Assets should always be recorded at their cost, when the asset is new and also for the life of the asset.  For instance, land purchased for $30,000 is appraised at the much higher value because the housing market has risen, but the reported value of the land will remain $30,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Financial Accounting, 6th Edition |first1=Paul D. |last1=Kimmel, PhD, CPA |first2=Jerry J. |last2=Weygandt, PhD, CPA |first3=Donald E. |last3=Kieso, PhD, CPA |year=2011 |publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons|Wiley]] |isbn=978-0-470-53477-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.accountingcoach.com/terms/C/cost-principle.html |title=cost principle |publisher=AccountingCoach.com |accessdate=28 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.e-sandhurst.com |title=Advice and Guidance on Accounting |publisher=e-sandhurst.com |accessdate=14 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12066">'''Differential accumulation''' is an approach for analysing capitalist development and crisis, tying together mergers and acquisitions, stagflation and globalization as integral facets of accumulation. The concept has been developed by [[Jonathan Nitzan]] and [[Shimshon Bichler]].

The concept of differential accumulation emphasizes the powerful drive by dominant capital groups to beat the average and exceed the normal rate of return. This concept is tied to a definition of [[Capital (economics)|capital]] as a social category rather than a material category (as seen by [[Neoclassical economics|neo-classical]] thinkers). "[[Capitalism]] is not an ‘economic system’, but a whole social order, and its principal category of capital must therefore have an ‘encompassing’ definition."&lt;ref&gt;[http://bnarchives.yorku.ca/9/ Differential Accumulation: Toward a New Political Economy of Capital.] Nitzan 1998, p. 175&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;...capitalization is a forward-looking process. What is being accumulated are claims on the future flow of profit. The pace of accumulation therefore depends on two factors: (a) the institutional arrangements affecting profit expectations; and (b) the normal rate of return used to discount them into their present value. The effect of rising industrial capacity on these factors is not only highly complex and possibly non-linear, but its direction can be positive as well as negative.

But then if capital is not ‘tangible’, how should its accumulation be measured? Surely, the mere augmentation of money values tells us little about power, particularly in the presence of inflation or deflation. The answer is rooted in the relative nature of power. The power of the absentee owner is the power to control part of the social process, and that becomes meaningful primarily against the power of other owners.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bnarchives.yorku.ca/9/ Differential Accumulation: Toward a New Political Economy of Capital.] Nitzan 1998, p. 204&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Regimes of accumulation ==
A firm can raise its profit through "breadth" by adding more employees to the organization. Conversely the firm can pursue "depth" by generating higher profit per employee. Each avenue of breadth and depth can be divided into pursuing differential accumulation through "internal" or "external" means. This gives us four categories of differential accumulation: internal breadth by [[Consolidation (business)|amalgamation]] (buy or join other businesses), external breadth through [[greenfield investment]] (build new factories), internal depth via [[Cost management|cost-cutting]] (make workers work harder or find ways to reduce the price of inputs), and external depth through [[stagflation]] (raise prices faster than the competition).&lt;ref&gt;[http://bnarchives.yorku.ca/3/ Regimes of Differential Accumulation: Mergers, Stagflation and the Logic of Globalization.] Nitzan 2001, p. 232&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dynamics of the regimes===
Nitzan and Bichler make several broad conclusions. 
(1) Of the four regimes, the most important are [[Consolidation (business)|amalgamation]] and [[stagflation]], which tend to oscillate inversely to each other. 
(2) Over the longer haul, amalgamation grows exponentially relative to green-field investment, contributing to the stagnation tendency of [[late capitalism|modern capitalism]]. 
(3) The wave-like pattern of [[mergers and acquisitions]] reflects the progressive break-up of socioeconomic ‘envelopes’, as dominant capital moves through successive amalgamation at the industry, sectoral, national, and, finally, global level. In this sense, they argue that the current global merger wave is an integral facet of differential accumulation. 
(4) Periodic lulls in amalgamation tend to be compensated for by stagflation, which appears as a crisis at the societal level, but which contributes significantly to differential accumulation at the disaggregate level. An end to the present worldwide merger boom could therefore trigger global stagflation. 
(5) [[Stagflation]] crises have been previously 'resolved' when dominant capital broke its existing envelope, pushing to amalgamate within a broader universe of takeover targets. Given that there is nothing more to conquer beyond the global envelope, Nitzan and Bichler argue that future stagflation crises may prove much more difficult to tame.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bnarchives.yorku.ca/3/ Regimes of Differential Accumulation: Mergers, Stagflation and the Logic of Globalization.] Nitzan 2001, p. 233&lt;/ref&gt;

== Stagflation in differential accumulation theory ==
Differential accumulation theory sees stagflation oscillate inversely with periods where [[mergers and acquisitions]] are dominant as a major strategy of dominant capital groups to "beat the market" or exceed the normal, average rate of return on investments.  If too many people try to "beat the average" a market imbalance results.  Stagflation, which appears as a crisis at the societal level, contributes significantly to differential accumulation at the disaggregate level, that is, of dominant capital groups accumulating faster than smaller businesses. Since the 20th century, the dominant capital group which has benefited from stagflation has been the "weapondollar-petrodollar coalition" during periods of Mid-east crises and rising oil prices. These periods have oscillated between periods of relative "peace" during which mergers and acquisitions have been the dominant strategy for beating the average.

=== Similarity to "supply shock" theories of stagflation ===
Differential accumulation theory shares some similarities with the "[[Stagflation#Supply_theory|supply shock]]" theory where there are sudden price changes due to a reduction in supply. One effect of cumulative mergers and acquisitions is that can result in concentrating the power to limit supply among fewer entities.

The supply shock theory in political economy has focused mainly on the effect of [[OPEC]] (Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries) on the price of oil through the restriction of supply. This is similar to differential accumulation's look at the "weapondollar-petrodollar coalition" and OPEC. The similarity ends where differential accumulation places the cause of the price of oil in the creation of a global feeling of crisis and perceived scarcity because of conflicts in the Middle East, and not, as supply shock theories hold, on an actual reduction in supply.

==Deflation and the crisis of accumulation==

Differential accumulation provides an alternative view to the [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s and the [[Global financial crisis of 2008–2009|global financial crisis of 2008 - 2009]]. Both of these crises are crises of deflation, and thus crises of accumulation. Businesses not only try to beat the average rate of accumulation, but struggle to avoid the threat of [[deflation]]. Deflation brings social destabilization and threatens capitalist accumulation. 

The overall debt burden of 2008 increases the deflationary threat over that from the Great Depression. Nitzan and Bichler state that the 2002 ratio of total debt to GDP in the US reached 290% - compared with 165% on the eve of the Great Depression. If prices begin to fall, they argue, firms will be unable to service their debt, which creates a risk of [[debt deflation]], chain bankruptcies, and the collapse of accumulation. "As the Great Depression unfolded falling nominal GDP caused the debt-to-GDP to soar to over 270%. a comparable drop now would push debt-to-GDP to over 400%".&lt;ref&gt;[http://bnarchives.yorku.ca/203/ New Imperialism or New Capitalism?] Nitzan and Bichler 2006, p.69.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nitzan and Bichler argue that the Great Depression brought deflation, not inflation (at least from an aggregate viewpoint). Gardiner Means (1935) showed in his study of the US during this period: smaller firms with little market power saw falling prices and only a moderate drop in output. Large firms were able to keep their prices relatively stable, and even raise them in some cases, and let output fall by as much as 80%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bnarchives.yorku.ca/203/ New Imperialism or New Capitalism?] Nitzan and Bichler 2006, p.63.&lt;/ref&gt;

They stipulate that the primary cause of these crises is not financial but a crisis of differential accumulation. Inflation was helpful for not only providing differential accumulation but also to forestall the threat of deflation. Mergers had been in hibernation since early 2000s, which resulted in a greater reliance on the socially disruptive tool of inflation as stagflation. The soaring price of oil from 2004 to 2008 helped to sustain inflation, but with a looming threat of cheap manufactured goods from developing countries. Deflation in 2008 had become a looming threat.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bnarchives.yorku.ca/251/02/20080515_bn_from_welltop_to_laptop_web.htm From Welltop to Laptop?] From Welltop to Laptop? 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Instead of focusing on the start of the US financial crisis, Nitzan and Bichler focus on [[Market_trend#Bear_market|bear markets]], the periods during which stocks (as measured in constant-dollars) were in a downward trend or where each successive peak is lower than the previous one.&lt;ref name="bnarchives.yorku"&gt;[http://bnarchives.yorku.ca/256/ Contours of Crisis: Plus ça change, plus c'est pareil?] Nitzan and Bichler 2009&lt;/ref&gt; By their reckoning a protracted Bear market has existed since 1999, which points to a much more entrenched accumulation crisis.

Nitzan and Bichler argue that there is nothing automatic about the shifts between bear and [[Market_trend#Bull_market|bull markets]]. Each crisis has had a different solution. They identify a number of bear markets in the last century and the unpredictable solutions that shifted capitalism back to bull markets:
* The crisis of 1905–1920 was resolved with a shift from robber-baron capitalism to large-scale business enterprise.
* The crisis of 1928–1948 saw the rise of the [[John Maynard Keynes|Keynesian]] welfare-warfare state and large government. "Unregulated" capitalism ended.
* The crisis of 1968–1981 saw neoliberal globalization, increasingly worldwide capital flows and the closing down of the Keynesian state.&lt;ref name="bnarchives.yorku" /&gt;

If the 2009 US stimulus package, the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009]] and proposed US budget are any indication, the 2008-9 crisis may see a return to the Keynesian state, at least for the United States.

The '''Doctor of Commerce''' ('''DCom''')&lt;ref&gt;General information can be accessed via, for example, the [[South African Qualifications Authority|SAQA]] [http://regqs.saqa.org.za/search.php?cat=qual qualifications page] or the [[New Zealand Qualifications Authority|NZQA]] [http://www.nzqa.govt.nz/qualifications-standards/qualifications/ qualifications page] searching for "doctor of commerce".&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[doctoral degree]] in [[commerce]]-, [[accounting]]-, [[economics]]-, and [[management]]-related subjects, awarded by universities in the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]]. The degree is offered both as a [[higher doctorate]], and as a [[research doctorate]].

The higher doctorate&lt;ref&gt;See for example the universities of [http://www.canterbury.ac.nz/regulations/award/dcom_regs.shtml Canterbury], [http://www.otago.ac.nz/courses/qualifications/dcom.html Otago], [http://clm.ukzn.ac.za/Libraries/Information_for_students/CLM_sflb.sflb.ashx Kwazulu-Natal], [http://courses.handbooks.uwa.edu.au/courses/c4/40910 Western Australia] and [http://www.wits.ac.za/files/gr264_189955001326275256.pdf Witwatersrand]{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.&lt;/ref&gt;
is awarded for published work of the candidate, demonstrating original contributions of "special excellence" in some branch of commerce. The candidate will be a graduate of the university in question.

The research doctorate&lt;ref&gt;See for example the [http://www.univen.ac.za/management_sciences/manage_programmes.html University of Venda] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120608233931/http://www.univen.ac.za/management_sciences/manage_programmes.html |date=June 8, 2012 }} and  [http://www.unisa.ac.za/Default.asp?Cmd=ViewContent&amp;ContentID=26739 UNISA].&lt;/ref&gt; is largely comparable to a [[PhD]] and in fact "Doctor of Commerce" may refer to a commerce-related [[PhD]].&lt;ref&gt;See for example [http://www.victoria.ac.nz/vms/study/postgraduate/phd.aspx Victoria University of Wellington] and [http://www.nmmu.ac.za/default.asp?id=4882&amp;aq=B%2B&amp;fc=1400&amp;bhcp=1 Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University]{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Relatedly, at some universities the degree-title conferred will be a function of the candidate’s background: for example, in [[operations research]], the degree may be a PhD or a DCom, depending on whether the candidate held a [[Master of Science]] or [[Master of Commerce]] respectively.&lt;ref&gt;For example, at [http://www.unisa.ac.za/Default.asp?Cmd=ViewContent&amp;ContentID=24967 UNISA], and the [http://www.univen.ac.za/management_sciences/manage_programmes.html University of Venda] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120608233931/http://www.univen.ac.za/management_sciences/manage_programmes.html |date=June 8, 2012 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Further, in some cases, the degree title may also depend on the area of the research: a thesis focused on a more theoretical area (e.g. [[financial economics|"finance"]]) will be awarded a PhD, while one focused on a specific area or function (e.g. [[Managerial finance|financial management]]) will be awarded a DCom.&lt;ref&gt;For example, at the [http://www.uj.ac.za/EN/Faculties/ecofin/departments/fininvestman/coursesandprogrammes/postgraduate/Pages/5PhDinFinance.aspx University of Johannesburg] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140106065404/http://www.uj.ac.za/EN/Faculties/ecofin/departments/fininvestman/coursesandprogrammes/postgraduate/Pages/5PhDinFinance.aspx |date=January 6, 2014 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Finally, in some cases the distinction will be whether the degree includes coursework or is entirely thesis based.&lt;ref&gt;For example, at the [http://web.up.ac.za/default.asp?ipkCategoryID=578&amp;sub=1&amp;parentid=40&amp;subid=575&amp;ipklookid=3 University of Pretoria] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131227140522/http://web.up.ac.za/default.asp?ipkCategoryID=578&amp;sub=1&amp;parentid=40&amp;subid=575&amp;ipklookid=3 |date=December 27, 2013 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The research doctorate is usually accessed following a [[Business education#Postgraduate education|related master's degree]], often the [[Master of Commerce]].  Here, there is generally a requirement that the [[master’s degree]] in question must include a research component, either comprising [[coursework]] with research, or being solely [[thesis]]-based.

The '''Foster Business Library''' is the business [[library]] at the [[University of Washington]] in [[Seattle, Washington]]. As part of the university [[University of Washington Libraries|system of libraries]], it serves the 3,500 students, faculty, and staff of the [[University of Washington Michael G. Foster School of Business|Foster School of Business]]. The 21,500 square-foot facility, which opened in 1997, is located under a garden, beneath an {{convert|80|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}} skylight, on two floors, connected with PACCAR Hall and adjacent to Dempsey Hall and the Bank of America Executive Education Center.

==Location==
The library is located below-ground among the complex of buildings that comprise the [[Foster School of Business]]. The main entrance is located on the first floor of PACCAR Hall with an accessible entrance on the lower (basement) level. Previous to a 2009 renovation, the library's main entrance had been through the Bank of America Executive Education Center.

==Name ==
The library is named in honor of Albert O. and Evelyn W. Foster. A 1928 graduate of the University of Washington Business School, Albert Foster founded Seattle-based investment banking firm Foster &amp; Marshall in 1938. Evelyn Foster was a 1932 graduate of the University of Washington. Albert and Evelyn were the parents of Michael G. Foster, for whom the Foster School of Business is named. Together, the Fosters established the Foster Foundation in 1984

== History ==
Made possible by a $3 million gift from the Foster Foundation in 1990, construction began in March 1995 with the library opening on June 23, 1997. A major renovation from 2009 to 2012 reoriented the library entrance through PACCAR Hall and increased seating and group study space.

==Inside Foster Library==

=== Hours ===
During the fall, winter, and spring quarters, the library is open Mondays through Thursdays from 8 a.m. to 11 p.m., on Fridays from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m., 12 noon to 5 p.m. on Saturdays, and 1 to 5 p.m. on Sundays. Hours are extended during exam weeks and shortened during the summer quarter, university holidays, and between quarters.

===Study Areas===
Foster Library provides computers, printers, scanners, study tables, and reservable group study rooms equipped with flat-panel displays.

=== Collection ===
The Foster Library collection supports the study and practice of business management with books, periodicals, and research databases. The collection primarily includes material that supports professional practice and research in accounting, finance, management, marketing, information systems management, international business, operations management, and entrepreneurship. Complementary and similar materials are housed in other UW libraries, including [[Suzzallo Library|Suzzallo-Allen Libraries]], [[Odegaard Undergraduate Library]], and the libraries at [[University of Washington Bothell]] and [[University of Washington Tacoma]].

He was the son of Hendrik Figee the elder who attended grade school and later became a surveyor. After passing his surveyor's exam, he went to work for his father in his steam engine factory on the Spaarne river. In 1866 he became full partner along with his brother Thomas and the company name changed to Gebroeders Figee (Figee brothers).&lt;ref name=NNBW&gt;[http://www.historici.nl/retroboeken/nnbw/#source=2&amp;page=227 Hendrik Figee] biography in the [[NNBW]]&lt;/ref&gt; He also helped start the crane manufacturing company Figee &amp; De Kruyff in Amsterdam and the ironworks called the Haarlems IJzergieterij. In 1883 his brother Thomas bought the shipbuilding company Conrad on the other side of the Spaarne river. Werf Conrad had been named after the renowned Dutch engineer [[Frederik Willem Conrad]] (1800-1870). Figee wanted to make dredgers (baggermolens).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beeldbank.noord-hollandsarchief.nl/memorix/404be2c0-fb8f-11df-9e4d-523bc2e286e2 picture of Conrad dredger being let into the water] in 1910 on North Holland Archives&lt;/ref&gt; The dredgers needed cranes on board, and these were supplied by Figee, which became a specialist in building cranes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.havenmuseum.nl/het-museum.collectieobject&amp;cat_id=5&amp;col_id=5 Crane]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} in the [[Haven Museum]], Rotterdam&lt;/ref&gt; He was a member of the board of the [[Maatschappij voor Nijverheid en Handel, Haarlem]] from 1898-1902 and was also a member of the board of the Colonial Museum, formerly located in [[villa Welgelegen]].&lt;ref name=NNBW/&gt;

The '''International Foodservice Distributors Association''' ('''IFDA''') is a [[Industry trade group|trade association]] serving the [[foodservice distribution]] industry. Its members include foodservice distributors, foodservice manufacturers, and foodservice buying groups. Their largest membership base is from [[North America]], but IFDA represents the industry internationally as well. IFDA traces its history to 1906 when the National Wholesale Grocers' Association (NWGA) was founded to promote food safety and represent the industry to government. In 1969, IFDA was created as a division of NAWGA to represent the specific needs of foodservice distribution. Eventually, IFDA began independent operation on January 1, 2003.

'''Jerry Zucker''' (August 24, 1949 &amp;ndash; April 12, 2008) was an Israeli-born American businessman and philanthropist.

==Career==
Zucker was president and CEO of the '''InterTech Group'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.postandcourier.com/article/20080413/PC1602/304139885 | title = Philanthropist Zucker dies | last = McDermott | first = John | publisher = The Post &amp; Courier | date = 13 April 2008 | accessdate = 11 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was President and CEO of the '''Polymer Group''' at the time it acquired the [[Montreal]]-based [[Dominion Textile|Dominion Textile Company]] in 1997; he resigned from Polymer Group in 2003. In 2006, he acquired the [[Hudson's Bay Company|Hudson's Bay Company of Canada]], North America's oldest company, becoming its Governor (Company Chairman) and CEO. Zucker was also a part-owner of the [[South Carolina Stingrays]] of the [[ECHL]]. He ranked #354 on [[Forbes 400|Forbes 400 Richest Americans]] and #746 on [https://www.forbes.com/lists/2006/10/G399.html Forbes Billionaire List 2006]. In 2008, Forbes placed his wealth at $1.2 billion [[USD]].&lt;ref name=PostandCourier&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.charleston.net/news/2008/apr/13/philanthropist_zucker_dies |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080414024343/http://www.charleston.net/news/2008/apr/13/philanthropist_zucker_dies/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=14 April 2008 |title=The Post and Courier - Charleston SC, News, Sports, Entertainment |publisher=Charleston.net |accessdate=14 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He held over 350 patents in his lifetime and donated millions of dollars to international medical missions as well as local charities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/18/business/18zucker.html | title = Jerry Zucker, Industrialist and Inventor, Is Dead at 58 | date = 18 April 2008 | newspaper = New York Times | accessdate = 11 March 2016| publisher = The Associated Press }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Jerry Zucker was born 24 August 1949 in [[Tel Aviv|Tel Aviv, Israel]], one of three children born to Leon Zucker and Zipora Zucker (née Shlifkovitz), the other two being his brother Jacob and his sister Rochelle. His parents were both [[Holocaust]] survivors. Zucker immigrated to the United States through [[Ellis Island]] in 1952.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.financialpost.com/story.html?id=443416 | accessdate = April 15, 2008 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080414174716/http://www.financialpost.com/story.html?id=443416 | archivedate=April 14, 2008 | title = HBC's future cloudy after Zucker dead at 58}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a child, he lived in South Carolina, Florida, and New Jersey, where he attended [[Jewish day schools]] his parents helped found. As a young man, Zucker attended the [[University of Florida]], majoring in Chemistry, Mathematics, and Physics. He later earned an M.S. in Electrical Engineering.&lt;ref name="Jerry Zucker"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/charleston/obituary.aspx?pid=107597187|title=Jerry Zucker|work=Charleston Post &amp; Courier|accessdate=14 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zucker passed away from a [[brain tumor]] 12 April 2008.&lt;ref&gt;Marina Strauss, Zucker's death puts HBC fate in question, The Globe and Mail, April 14, 2008, p.B4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newswire.ca/en/releases/archive/April2008/12/c5067.html|title=Hudson's Bay - HBC Announces Passing of Jerry Zucker|publisher=Newswire.ca|accessdate=14 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zucker was survived by his wife Anita,  and by his children Jonathan Zucker, Andrea Muzin, and Jeffrey Zucker.&lt;ref name=PostandCourier/&gt;

At the time of his death, Zucker had been married to Anita Goldberg, his high school sweetheart, for 38 years. Together, they had three children: Jonathan, Andrea, and Jeffrey. Zucker lived most of his adult life in [[Charleston, South Carolina]] &lt;ref name="Jerry Zucker"/&gt;

Ted Levin, president of the Emanu-el synagogue, said at Zucker's funeral:
: "Anybody who reached out to him for help never went away with an empty hand....It's a loss not just for our community, or for [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]], but it's a loss for the world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://archiver.rootsweb.ancestry.com/th/read/OBITUARIES/2008-06/1214701892 | title = Obituaries - Jerry L. Zucker | date = 29 June 2008 | accessdate = 14 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Shortly after Zucker's death, the [[Charleston County School District|Charleston County School Board]] decided to name a new [[North Charleston]] middle school in his honor. The Jerry Zucker Middle School of Science opened on August 24, 2008, which would have been Zucker's 59th birthday.

The [[South Carolina Stingrays]], of which Zucker was part owner, adorned their helmets with a "JZ" sticker; the practice continues. The team also recognized his contributions to the team and the community by inducting him into the Stingrays Hockey Hall of Fame on March 21, 2009. The Stingrays organization unveiled the Jerry Zucker Community Service award, to be given annually to the Stingrays player who had the greatest impact on the local community. The first to receive the award was Stingrays [[Forward (ice hockey)|forward]] [[Spencer Carbery]]. The Jerry Zucker [[Ride for Hope]], started in October 2008, provides fundraising efforts for cancer research at the Hollings Cancer Center at the [[Medical University of South Carolina]].

In June 2009, Zucker's family made a donation of $2 million in Zucker's name to the [[Medical University of South Carolina]]. $1 million was allocated for the establishment of the Jerry Zucker Endowed Chair in Brain Tumor Research, an institution intended to support research and investigation into brain tumors.  The remainder was used to support spinal cord research and provide neurological care and medical training in [[Tanzania]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="764">'''John Hilton''', ([[Circa|c.]] 1791 &amp;ndash; 19 June 1866), was an English-born furniture manufacturer who is known to have been active in [[Montreal]] by 1808. He became one of the most successful businessmen in the city and the quality and quantity of his product gave confidence and impetus to a developing Canadian industry. His partner for a time, [[Edmond Baird]], was an important artisan in this competitive business.
I think he was single all his life.

[[Malay styles and titles|Tan Sri Dato' Seri]] '''Abdul Khalid bin Ibrahim''' (born 14 December 1946) is a [[Malaysian people|Malaysian]] politician who served as the 14th [[Menteri Besar]] (Chief Minister) of the state of [[Selangor]] from 2008 to 2014. He was elected to the [[Selangor State Assembly]] and the [[Dewan Rakyat|Parliament of Malaysia]] in 2008 and 2013 as a member of the [[People's Justice Party (Malaysia)|People's Justice Party]] (PKR), but became an [[independent (politician)|independent]] in August 2014, coinciding with his resignation as Menteri Besar. He was sacked from the party for his refusal to vacate his Selangor Menteri Besar post.

==Early life and business career==
Khalid was born in the village of Kampung Jalan Raja Abdullah in [[Kuala Selangor]] district, Selangor. He graduated from the [[University of Malaya]] with a [[Bachelor's Degree]] in Economics and later obtained an [[MBA]] from the [[University of Queensland]].&lt;ref name = "khalid"&gt;{{cite news | last = | first = | title = Fact boxes on Ijok (subscription required)| publisher = malaysiakini.com| date = 19 April 2007| url = http://www.malaysiakini.com/news/66177| accessdate = 20 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Khalid began his career as a university lecturer. In 1979 he joined the [[United Malays National Organisation]] (UMNO), the leading party in Malaysia's ruling [[Barisan Nasional]] (BN) coalition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/sacked-from-party-khalid-set-to-join-past-selangor-mbs-who-fell-from-grace |title=Sacked from party, Khalid set to join past Selangor MBs who fell from grace |date=10 August 2014 |work=Malaysian Insider |accessdate=27 September 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006083529/http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/sacked-from-party-khalid-set-to-join-past-selangor-mbs-who-fell-from-grace |archivedate= 6 October 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, he became the chief executive of the government-controlled [[fund management]] firm [[Permodalan Nasional Berhad]] (PNB), a position he held until 1994.&lt;ref name = "khalid"/&gt; In 1981, he became famous for leading the "dawn raid" on the [[London Stock Exchange]], which resulted in PNB gaining a 51% share in British [[plantation]] concern Guthrie in less than two hours. He later became the CEO of the Malaysianized Guthrie, now known as [[Guthrie (Malaysia)|Kumpulan Guthrie Bhd]], from 1995 to 2003.&lt;ref name = "khalid"/&gt;

==Political career==
In 2006, Khalid joined the opposition PKR, founded by the former deputy prime minister [[Anwar Ibrahim]], and became the party's treasurer-general. The party selected him as its candidate for a [[Ijok by-election, 2007|by-election]] for the [[Selangor State Legislative Assembly]] seat of [[Ijok]], which he lost to [[K. Parthiban]] of the [[Malaysian Indian Congress]] (MIC), a component party of the ruling [[Barisan Nasional]] (BN) coalition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thesundaily.my/node/170632|title=Khalid is Keadilan's pick for Ijok|date=18 April 2007|work=The Sun (Malaysia)|accessdate=26 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Malaysian general election, 2008|2008 general election]], he contested the federal parliamentary seat of [[Bandar Tun Razak]] and re-contested the Selangor State Assembly seat of [[Ijok]]. He won both seats, while the opposition [[Pakatan Rakyat]] coalition made unprecedented gains and took a majority in the Selangor State Assembly. Khalid was appointed as the Menteri Besar of Selangor and was sworn in on 13 March 2008. He was the first person not of the BN coalition to hold the post.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=The New Straits Times |url=http://www.nst.com.my/Current_News/NST/Thursday/NewsBreak/20080313173454/Article/index_html |title=Khalid Ibrahim sworn-in as new Selangor Mentri Besar |date=13 March 2008 |accessdate=13 March 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080314043108/http://www.nst.com.my/Current_News/NST/Thursday/NewsBreak/20080313173454/Article/index_html |archivedate=14 March 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his first term, Khalid's government implemented a policy of delivering to each Selangor household an initial 20 cubic metres of water each year free of charge. The State Assembly also passed the country's first freedom of information legislation. It was in these areas—social policy and government transparency—that his administration was able to make the most progress. But in some cases, differences between the partners in the governing coalition, which included (the [[Democratic Action Party]] (DAP)) and the [[Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party]] (PAS)), proved difficult to reconcile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Harding|first=Andrew|title=The Constitution of Malaysia: A Contextual Analysis|year=2012|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=1847319831|chapter=Chapter 5}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in 2009 Khalid rejected a move by PAS to draft legislation banning the sale of alcohol in Muslim-majority neighbourhoods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.asiaone.com/News/AsiaOne+News/Malaysia/Story/A1Story20090808-159869.html|title=Khalid: Alcohol sales to continue|last=Mazlinda Mahmood|date=8 August 2009|work=New Straits Times|accessdate=27 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Malaysian general election, 2013|2013 general election]], Khalid's Pakatan Rakyat coalition increased its majority in the Selangor State Assembly, winning 44 out of its 56 seats. Though Khalid's PKR won fewer seats than the DAP and PAS, he retained the position of Menteri Besar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.fz.com/content/ge13-pakatan-retains-selangor-44-seats|title=GE13: Pakatan retains Selangor with 44 seats|date=6 May 2013|work=fz.com|accessdate=27 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2014, PKR's national leader, Anwar Ibrahim, then a federal parliamentarian, sought to contest the Selangor State Assembly seat of [[Kajang]] in a [[Kajang by-election, 2014|by-election]]. The so-called "[[Kajang Move]]" would have allowed Anwar to oust Khalid as Menteri Besar with PKR's support. Anwar's conviction on a charge of sodomy caused Anwar's wife, [[Wan Azizah Wan Ismail]], to take over Anwar's presidency of PKR and the nomination as PKR candidate in the by-election instead, which she won. In July, the party nominated Wan Azizah as its preferred Menteri Besar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/no-surprise-as-pkr-endorses-wan-azizah-for-selangor-mb-post |title=No surprise as PKR endorses Wan Azizah for Selangor MB post |date=22 July 2014 |work=Malaysian Insider |accessdate=27 September 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140724035056/http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/no-surprise-as-pkr-endorses-wan-azizah-for-selangor-mb-post |archivedate=24 July 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The following month, Khalid was expelled from the party after he refused to comply with its direction for him to resign as the state's premier and make way for Wan Azizah.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://english.astroawani.com/news/show/khalid-ibrahim-expelled-from-pkr-effective-immediately-41585|title=Khalid Ibrahim expelled from PKR effective immediately|date=9 August 2014|work=Astro Awani|accessdate=27 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Khalid sacked the PKR and DAP members of Selangor's [[Cabinet (government)|Cabinet]]-like Executive Council,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.themalaymailonline.com/malaysia/article/khalid-flexes-muscle-sacks-pkr-dap-excos|title=Khalid flexes muscle, sacks PKR, DAP excos|last=Shazwan Mustafa Kamal|date=12 August 2014|work=Malay Mail|accessdate=27 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and continued to administer the state as an independent assemblyman with the remaining four councillors from PAS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thestar.com.my/News/Nation/2014/08/20/Selangor-MB-crisis-PAS-exco/|title=Selangor MB crisis: PAS exco member throws support behind Khalid|last=Ruban|first=A.|date=20 August 2014|work=The Star|accessdate=27 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Khalid ultimately resigned on 26 August 2014, as it being clear that he could no longer command the confidence of the State Assembly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nst.com.my/node/26959|title=S’gor Sultan defers Khalid’s resignation until Pakatan names more candidates|last=Nuradilla Noorazam|date=26 August 2014|work=New Straits Times|accessdate=27 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He remained in office while [[Sharafuddin of Selangor|Sultan Sharafuddin]] deliberated on whom to appoint as his replacement, before settling on PKR's deputy president [[Azmin Ali]], who was sworn in on 23 September 2014.

'''Ladd &amp; Company''' was an early business partnership in the [[Kingdom of Hawaii]].
Its founders were '''William Ladd''' (1807–1863), '''Peter Allen (or Allan) Brinsmade''' (1804–1859), and [[William Northey Hooper]] (1809–1878). The company was behind the first commercial [[sugarcane]] [[Sugar plantations in Hawaii|plantation]] and first international land speculation in the [[Hawaiian Islands]].

==Founders==
William Ladd was born May 11, 1807, in [[Hallowell, Maine]]. His father, John Ladd, sailed for South America and died about 1820. The younger Ladd married Lucretia Goodale (1807–1874) who was related to an earlier missionary to Hawaii, [[Lucy Goodale Thurston]]. Ladd's daughter Mary (1840–1908) married [[Joseph Oliver Carter]] (1835–1909), son of another Bostonian, Captain Joseph Oliver Carter (1802–1850), sister of diplomat [[Henry A. P. Carter]] (1837–1891).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Joseph Oliver Carter: the founder of the Carter family in Hawaii, with a brief genealogy |publisher= Hawaiian Historical Society |year=1915 |page= 20 |author= George Robert Carter |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=E72RAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Peter A. Brinsmade was born April 1, 1804, in [[New Hartford, Connecticut]]. He graduated from [[Bowdoin College]] in 1826 and attended [[Andover Seminary]] 1826–1828 and [[Yale Theological Seminary]] 1828–1829.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= General catalogue of Bowdoin College and the Medical School of Maine, 1794-1912 |publisher= Bowdoin College |page= 75 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Jw9CAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA75 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He married Elizabeth Goodale of Hallowell, Maine, sister of Lucretia in 1830.

William Northey Hooper was born October 16, 1809, in [[Manchester, Massachusetts]]. His father was sea captain William Hooper (1771–1809) and mother was Sally Northey. Hooper married Charlotte Augusta Wood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Hooper genealogy |editor= Thomas Hooper |year= 1908 |page= 206 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=PeZUAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA206 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The six sailed on the ''Hellespont'' from Boston in 1832. They arrived in [[Honolulu]] July 27, 1833.

==Hawaii==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Honoluluharboraerial.jpg|thumb|alt=aerial view of harbor|[[Honolulu Harbor]] today, site of Ladd &amp; Co. 1833 store]] --&gt;
The first venture of Ladd &amp; Co. was a store in Honolulu opened in July 1833. It was on a prime site of waterfront land at [[Honolulu Harbor]], coordinates {{coord| 21|18|37|N| 157|51|50|W| type:landmark_region:US-HI| display=inline| name= Ladd &amp; Co. store }}. Because of Brinsmade's theological training, they were sometimes called the "Pious Traders". The partners erected a large stone house and other buildings that served as family housing, offices, and storage. They would first use a sunken ship's hulk as a wharf, and later build a more permanent one. The business, however, barely supported their families.&lt;ref name="hjh98"/&gt;

In 1835 Ladd &amp; Co. leased {{convert|980|acre}} for a sugarcane plantation in [[Koloa, Hawaii|Kōloa]] on the island of [[Kauai|Kaua{{okina}}i]] from Royal Governor [[Kaikioewa]].&lt;ref name="keeper"&gt;{{cite web |author= Darlene E. Kelley |title= Important People - Part 18. |work = Keepers of the Culture: A study in time of the Hawaiian Islands As told by the ancients |url= http://files.usgwarchives.net/hi/statewide/newspapers/importan39nnw.txt |date= August 10, 2008 |accessdate=2010-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project had the support of conservative missionaries such as [[Hiram Bingham I]].&lt;ref name="daughters"&gt;{{cite news |title= A Leaf in History: Showing how the government of the Hawaiian Islands was induced to perpetuate great wrongs against American merchants in aid of English merchants |publisher= [[Daughters of the American Revolution]] |work= Daughters of the American Revolution magazine |volume=6 |number=1 |date= January 1895 |pages=121–127 |author= Mary S. Lockwood |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=YRcXAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA121 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although sugarcane had been raised by [[ancient Hawaii]]ans on small personal plots, this was the first large-scale commercial production in Hawaii.&lt;ref name="cushing"&gt;{{cite journal |hdl= 10524/508 |title= Beginnings of Sugar Production in Hawai'i |volume=19 |author= Robert L. Cushing |year= 1985 |pages= 17–34}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Joseph Goodrich of the [[Waiakea Mission Station-Hilo Station|Hilo mission]] and Samuel Ruggles of the [[Kahikolu Church|Kona Mission]] had experimented with using agriculture to support their missions as well as give employment to their students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |hdl=10524/84 |title=Sandwich Island Missionaries: The First American Point Four Agents |author=Merze Tate |work=Annual report of the Hawaiian Historical Society |year=1962 |publisher=Hawaiian Historical Society }}&lt;/ref&gt;
After trying unsuccessfully to get Rev. Goodrich to run the operation, Hooper moved to the land as manager, despite having no training in engineering nor agriculture.&lt;ref name="cushing"/&gt;

[[File:Kauai-old-sugar-mill-Koloa-chimney.JPG|thumb|left|alt=chimney ruin|Ruins of the [[Old Sugar Mill of Koloa|Ladd sugar mill]]]]
The first planting was in September 1835, and although a small amount of [[molasses]] was produced in 1836, the wooden rollers in the mill were replaced with iron ones for increased production.
By 1837, the mill produced over {{convert|4000|lb}} of sugar and {{convert|700|usgal|l}} of molasses .
A subsequent mill, whose ruins are still visible, was built from 1839 to 1841. This [[Old Sugar Mill of Koloa|Kōloa Sugar Mill]] is now a [[National Historic Landmark]].&lt;ref name="focus"&gt;{{cite web |title= Old Sugar Mill of Koloa nomination form |author= Benjamin Levy| work= National Register of Historic Places |date= August 1978 |publisher= U.S. National Park Service |url= {{NHLS url|id=66000296}} |accessdate=2010-03-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 13, 1839 Peter Brinsmade was appointed American consular agent after [[John Coffin Jones]]. This was originally an unpaid position of the lowest rank in the [[United States Department of State]]. In July 1844 he was promoted to the rank of [[Consul (representative)|Consul]]. William Hooper would act as deputy when Brinsmade was on his extended trip away from the islands. Their duties were reporting on commerce and protecting American citizens.&lt;ref name="hackler08"&gt;{{cite news |hdl= 10524/342  |title= "Earnest Persuasion but Not Peremptory Demand:" United States Government Policy toward the Kingdom of Hawaiʻi, 1820–1863 |work= Hawaiian Journal of History |publisher=Hawaii Historical Society |volume= 42 |author= Rhoda E. A. Hackler |year= 2008 |pages= 49–67}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hooper sailed to Boston in 1840 but returned by May 1841.&lt;ref name="diary"/&gt;

In November 1841 the partners negotiated a much larger deal with [[William Richards (Hawaii)|William Richards]], a former missionary who was now a political advisor. The idea was to form a [[joint stock company]] to develop all unoccupied land in the kingdom. Richards thought that adding a clause that invalidated the agreement unless Hawaii continued to be an independent country would help investors pressure world powers to protect its government. 
Brinsmade traveled back to the United States trying to find investors. He could not get any takers. He then went to Britain, and then France. He met up with [[Timothy Haalilio|Timothy Ha{{okina}}alilio]] who was sent with Richards to negotiate for official recognition. Finally they seemed to find a partner in [[Belgium]]: Brinsmade convinced the [[Belgian colonial empire|Belgian Colonization Company]] headed by King [[Leopold I of Belgium]] on May 16, 1843, to sign a contract.
The agreement would transfer stock in Ladd &amp; Co. to the Belgian investors in exchange for a badly needed infusion of cash.&lt;ref name="evidence"/&gt;

Just then news arrived that the Hawaiian islands had been taken under a military occupation called the [[Paulet Affair (1843)|Paulet Affair]]. The clause that was supposed to help guarantee Hawaii's independence now made the deal grind to a halt. James F. B. Marshall, a young associate of Ladd &amp; Co., had secretly made his way to London with letters from Kamehameha III presenting his side of the occupation. Brinsmade met him in London and desperately negotiated with the British foreign office. [[George Hamilton-Gordon, 4th Earl of Aberdeen|Lord Aberdeen]] who was British [[Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs]], had been told by British Consul [[Richard Charlton (Hawaii)|Richard Charlton]] that Americans were granted a land monopoly. Brinsmade convinced Aberdeen that he would be happy to take investors from any country, using the Belgium contract as his proof. Finally on November 28, 1844, a joint declaration with Britain and France recognized Hawaii's independence. Marshall had returned to Hawaii while Richards and Ha{{okina}}alilio tried to get the United States to also recognize the Hawaiian Kingdom.&lt;ref name="marshall"&gt;{{cite news |title= An unpublished chapter of Hawaiian History |work= Harper's magazine |author= James F. B. Marshall |volume= 67 |year=  1883 |pages= 511–520 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=-4UCAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA511 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Saksen-Koburg Leopold-2a.jpeg|thumb|upright|alt=man in 19th-century European military uniform|[[Leopold I of Belgium|King Leopold]] was expected to be their investor]]

Brinsmade stayed in Europe trying to collect, but the investors were now wary. Meanwhile, Ladd &amp; Co. was borrowing heavily to finance new facilities for its expected expansion. Some of this money came from the King himself. The U.S. State Department replaced Brinsmade as Consul during his absence in January 1845 by [[Alexander G. Abell]].&lt;ref name="greer"&gt;{{cite news |hdl= 10524/441 |title= A. G.

For the first time, a diplomatic representative called "Commissioner", George Brown, also was appointed in March 1843, in addition to the trade representative.&lt;ref name="hackler08"/&gt;
[[Gerrit P. Judd]], the Finance Minister of the Kingdom, realized the government itself was short of cash and called in their loan. Judd and Richards convinced the Hawaiian government to disavow the deal. At least one historian notes a factor in losing the support of the American Protestant missionaries was the fact that the Belgians were generally Catholic.&lt;ref name="Simpson"&gt;{{cite news |hdl= 10524/142 |title= Sir George Simpson and the Mission for Hawaiian Independence 1840-1843 |work= Hawaiian Journal of History |publisher=Hawaii Historical Society |volume= 20 |author= Richard MacAllan |year= 1986 |pages= 67–82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When a newspaper report on Ladd's shaky financial situation got back to Belgium, the investors pulled out of the deal for good. Brinsmade returned to Hawaii empty-handed in March 1846.

With no incoming cash, the Honolulu Ladd &amp; Co. had shut down in November 1844. 
As the company liquidated, they felt they were owned money by the government, but the case required lengthy arbitration.&lt;ref name="evidence"&gt;{{cite book |title= Report of the proceedings and evidence in the arbitration between the King and Government of the Hawaiian Islands and Messrs. Ladd &amp; Co., before Messrs. Stephen H. Williams &amp; James F. B. Marshall, arbitrators under compact |authors= [[John Ricord]], Stephen H. Williams, James F. B. Marshall |publisher= C.E. Hitchcock, printer, Hawaiian Government press |year= 1846 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=s2iW_IL-mlkC }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Both the British and Americans accused the Kingdom of being biased against them.&lt;ref name="daughters"/&gt;

Then Brinsmade sued newspaper publisher [[James Jackson Jarves]] for libel for publishing the story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= History of the Hawaiian islands: embracing their antiquities, mythology |edition=3rd |author= [[James Jackson Jarves]] |pages=211–230 |publisher= C.E. Hitchcock |year=1847 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=r6RZeukWpXwC&amp;pg=PA211 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
There was now an official Attorney General for the first time in Hawaii: [[John Ricord]]. However, several parties to the lawsuits did not recognize his authority, so this case was added to the arbitration. In June 1846 the new American Commissioner [[Anthony Ten Eyck]] arrived, who served as lawyer for the company. [[Joel Turrill]] took over as the new Consul. After many hearings, which were treated as entertaining theater by the Honolulu residents, Ladd &amp; Co. gave up recovering anything.&lt;ref name="greer"/&gt;
By October 1846 [[Charles Reed Bishop]] and [[William Little Lee]] arrived from New York. Lee would organize a court system and become its chief justice. Bishop would help sort out the accounts of Ladd &amp; Co., then start Hawaii's first bank and inherit the largest landholdings in the islands.

==New speculation==
The old Ladd store and house complex was auctioned off, and one of the new tenants was Robert Cheshire Janion, founder of what would become [[Theo H. Davies &amp; Co.]] Part of their wharf was used by Charles Brewer of [[C. Brewer &amp; Co.]] These became two of the "[[Big Five (Hawaii)|Big Five]]" corporations dominating the Hawaiian economy in later decades.&lt;ref name="hjh98"&gt;{{cite news |hdl= 10524/430 |title= Along the Old Honolulu Waterfront |work= Hawaiian Journal of History |publisher=Hawaii Historical Society |volume= 32 |author= Richard A.

The Kōloa plantation was repossessed by the Hawaiian government and sold to Robert Wood, Hooper's brother-in-law, who ran it until 1874. 
It was purchased by the McBryde family in 1899, who operated it until shut down in 1996 as part of [[Alexander &amp; Baldwin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= HC&amp;S, last of sugarcane plantations, on track toward more financial losses |author= Andrew Gomes |date= November 15, 2009  |newspaper= [[Honolulu Advertiser]] |url= http://the.honoluluadvertiser.com/article/2009/Nov/15/ln/hawaii911150370.html |accessdate=2010-03-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brinsmade published a few articles in a new newspaper called the ''Sandwich Islands News'' which had been started to counter Jarves' paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Hawaiian National Bibliography, 1780-1900: 1831-1850  |chapter= Sandwich Islands News |author= David W.

Brinsmade sailed to San Francisco as part of the [[California Gold Rush]], where he worked for newspapers and attempted various businesses for prospectors. 
He returned to Massachusetts where he died October 6, 1859.

Hooper also sailed to San Francisco in November 1848&lt;ref name="diary"&gt;{{cite web |title= Finding Aid for the Diaries of William Hooper |publisher= Kauai Historical Society, Lihue, Kauaʻi, Hawaii |url= http://www.kauaihistoricalsociety.org/assets/finding_aids/manuscript_22__william_hooper_diaries.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; and worked for Cross, Hobson &amp; Co. where he died on December 31, 1878.

Ladd died February 8, 1863, in Honolulu.&lt;ref name="laddobit"&gt;{{cite news |title= Funerals |newspaper= Sailor's Magazine |page=310 |date= June 1864 |volume= 36 |number= 10 |publisher= [[American Seamen's Friend Society]] |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=eNkaAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA310 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Ladd and his brother, John Ladd, who died October 11, 1859, were buried in [[Oahu Cemetery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |hdl= 10524/384 |title= Here Lies History: Oahu Cemetery, a Mirror of Old Honolulu |publisher=Hawaii Historical Society |volume=1 |author= Richard A.

The '''Lowertown Historic District''' is a [[Historic districts in the United States|historic district]] in the Lowertown neighborhood of [[Saint Paul, Minnesota]], United States.  This 16-block warehouse and wholesaling district comprises 37 [[contributing properties]] built 1870s–1920. It was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1983 for the significance of its river and rail connections, economic impact, architecture, and urban planning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Murphy |first=Patricia |author2=Susan Granger |title=National Register of Historic Places Registration Form: Lowertown Historic District |url=http://nrhp.mnhs.org/nomination/83000935.pdf |publisher=National Park Service |date=1981-11-30 |accessdate=2013-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lowertown was originally the lower landing on the [[Mississippi River]]; the first port of access to the [[Minneapolis–Saint Paul|Twin Cities]]. Several warehouse, railroad, banking, and distribution buildings served the entire [[Upper Midwest]] from 1880 to 1920. A significant concentration of these buildings survive, unified by similar architectural styles and construction materials. Many were designed by the city's most prestigious architects, including Cass Gilbert and Clarence Johnston, Sr.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lowertownlanding.com/lowertown-building-history/|title=Lowertown History |publisher=Lowertown Landing |date= |accessdate=2013-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Lowertown neighborhood declined after the Depression. The renovation of the Merchant's National Bank Building (now McColl Building) in the late 1960s was the first project to focus attention on revitalization potential. The conversion of the Noyes Brothers and Cutler Building into a complex of offices, shops, and restaurants (now known as Park Square Court) soon followed. The city's Housing and Redevelopment Authority (HRA) became involved in 1973 when Mears Park was redesigned by William Sanders and renamed after Norman B. Mears, a Saint Paul businessman.

In April, 1978 the Lowertown Redevelopment Corporation (LRC) was organized with the goal of creating “a place for people, a highly livable urban village in the midst of the city, which will bring new jobs, housing, commercial development, and year round activities to Lowertown and infuse the city with renewed vitality.”&lt;ref&gt;http://lowertownsaintpaul.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/full-lowertown-master-plan2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Enabled by an unprecedented $10 million grant by the McKnight Foundation, the LRC assumed the role and responsibility of driving the revitalization of Lowertown. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, artists moved to Lowertown, attracted by low rents, raw space and relative quiet. This new population began to bring life to the buildings and the streets of Lowertown. Initiated by the LRC and supported fully by the City of St. Paul, Lowertown was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983;&lt;ref&gt;http://nrhp.focus.nps.gov/natregsearchresult.do?fullresult=true&amp;recordid=54&lt;/ref&gt; the next year, the City of St. Paul designated the Lowertown Historic District as a Heritage Preservation Site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stpaul.gov/index.aspx?NID=4338&amp;ART=7988&amp;ADMIN=1 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-06-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130127025950/http://www.stpaul.gov/index.aspx?NID=4338&amp;ART=7988&amp;ADMIN=1 |archivedate=2013-01-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Redevelopment==
Aided by these designations and the associated tax credits, Artspace, the LRC, the City and others partnered to renovate three buildings dedicated to the arts. The Lowertown Artists Lofts Cooperative, the Tilsner and the Northern Warehouse were renovated and became the anchors for the arts community.{{when|date=May 2017}} Throughout the years, there has been a steady commitment to incrementally reinvest in the assets of Lowertown. Instead of demolishing and building new, Lowertown remained committed to a slow, deliberate and steady approach to redevelopment. This approach allowed Lowertown to remain a relatively quiet neighborhood on the edge of downtown. Such an approach was particularly supportive of the artist community, as it respected the financial and environmental needs of working artists. In 1982, the St. Paul Farmers’ Market moved to Lowertown. An institution since the late 1800s, the Farmers’ Market was an anomaly of sorts for Lowertown - it was a destination in the middle of a relatively quiet neighborhood. The market now draws 20,000 people each weekend in the summer. In 2006 the LRC transformed into the Lowertown Future Fund to continue supporting Lowertown redevelopment.

New residences have been built in the neighborhood, attracting new residents paying market rate for condominiums. Restaurants, festivals, weddings and other regional attractions, such as the restored Union Depot, have opened in Lowertown. (Greater Lowertown Master Plan, 2011)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lowertownlanding.com/lowertown-redevelopment/|title=Lowertown Redevelopment |publisher=Lowertown Landing |date= |accessdate=2013-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [http://www.stpaulartcrawl.org/  St. Paul Art Crawl] is held twice a year (Spring and Fall) and exemplifies the cultural atmosphere that local residents have worked so hard to maintain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://loftsatfarmersmarketblog.com/2011/12/27/st-paul-art-crawl-april-27-29th/|title=Annual Art Crawl |publisher=LFM |date= |accessdate=2011-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late 2013, USA Today named Lowertown 1 of "10 up-and-coming neighborhoods around the USA" &lt;ref&gt;https://www.usatoday.com/experience/america/best-of-lists/10-up-and-coming-neighborhoods-to-explore-this-summer/8814935/&lt;/ref&gt; after it was announced RealtyTrac named Lowertown at the top of its "hipster zip codes" list.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.realtytrac.com/Content/news-and-opinion/top-25-hipster-zips-for-returns-on-rental-properties-7940&lt;/ref&gt; The "hipster" designation implies the neighborhood's high proportion of "people between 25 and 34 years old who use public transportation and rent their housing." &lt;ref&gt;http://www.twincities.com/localnews/ci_25730731/hipster-rebirth-st-pauls-lowertown-noted-usa-today&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, the [[St. Paul Saints]] professional baseball team opened its season in the new [[CHS Field]]. The stadium stands in the space of the former Gilette/Diamond Products plant at 5th Street and Broadway. Designs for the stadium were presented to the public in December 2013.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.twincities.com/stpaul/ci_24662098/st-paul-saints-ballpark-designs-unveiled&lt;/ref&gt; Art installations from local artists adorn the exterior of the ballpark. Despite its name, the CHS Field sits outside the official 18 blocks that make up the Lowertown Heritage Preservation District, roughly bound by Kellogg Boulevard, Broadway, 7th Street and Jackson Street.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stpaul.gov/DocumentCenter/Home/View/20504 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-06-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140811204331/http://www.stpaul.gov/DocumentCenter/Home/View/20504 |archivedate=2014-08-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mears Park==

[[File:Mears Park, Lowertown St Paul Clock 433125593 o.jpg|thumb|Mears Park, Lowertown St Paul Clock]]
Previously known as Smith Park, Park Square, and Baptist Hill, Mears Park is bounded by 5th, 6th, Sibley and Wacouta streets. The site was originally the home of the First Baptist congregation, who built their church on top of a hill in the middle of a city block. In 1849 the land was donated to the city by a man named Robert Smith after the church expanded to a new location a few blocks north. The hill was leveled and the square was formally created in 1888.&lt;ref name="millet"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Millet|first1=Larry|title=AIA Guide to Downtown St. Paul|date=2010|publisher=Minnesota Historical Society Press|page=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For most of the next century, the park was a traditional city square with a central fountain and sidewalks radiating about it. In the early 1970s, the park became known as the “Brickyard” after a renovation covered much of the square in bricks. After his death in 1974, the park was officially renamed after Norman Mears, a St. Paul inventor in the printing and etching field; his inventions were used to fight World War II and make color televisions. After retirement, Mears had set his sights on the revitalization of Lowertown.&lt;ref name="millet"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Norman B. Mears|url=http://www.minnesotainventors.org/inductees/norman-b-mears.html|website=Minnesota Inventors Hall of Fame}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern-day Mears Park was opened in 1992 following a major reconstruction designed by landscape architect Don Ganje and artist Brad Goldberg. The new design received rave reviews for brilliantly mixing natural and manmade elements, from the rocky stream to the metal bandshell, and has proven popular year after year. Today the park sits in the middle of a re-energized Lowertown, hosting handfuls of fairs and festivals throughout the season including [http://musicinmears.com/ Music in Mears] the [[Twin Cities Jazz Festival]] and [[Concrete and Grass Music Festival]]. Volunteers known as the Friends of Mears Park maintain the gardens.&lt;ref name="millet"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lowertownlanding.com/lowertown-historic-places-mears-park|title=Mears Park |publisher=Lowertown Landing |date= |accessdate=2013-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Crane Ordway Building==
Crane and Ordway manufactured valves, fittings, and supplies for steam engines.&lt;ref&gt;[http://saintpaulhistorical.com/items/show/217 “Crane Building,” City of Saint Paul and the Saint Paul Heritage Preservation Commission, Saint Paul Historical, 1988]&lt;/ref&gt; Rogers and Ordway was the successor company to Wilson &amp; Rogers, the oldest firm in the line of plumbing and steam fittings in the Northwest. At one time, The Crane Company was the largest manufacturer of valves, fittings, and steam supplies in the world, employing over 3,000 men at the factory in Chicago factory. In 1892 Crane bought out the Rugg-Fuller Company in Minneapolis.

On January 1, 1893 [[Richard T. Crane|Richard Teller Crane]] of Chicago, Illinois and [[Lucius Pond Ordway]] of St. Paul, Minnesota incorporated the '''Crane &amp; Ordway Company'''. It consolidated the firms of Rogers and Ordway of St. Paul and Duluth with a branch of the Crane Co. in Minneapolis,&lt;ref name=valve&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=gD7OAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA313&amp;lpg=PA313&amp;dq=crane+ordway+building+st+paul&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=1TmIFbJHed&amp;sig=UjAyjFgRK2u4Sx_1Rb7rZpCO1BI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CFQQ6AEwCTgeahUKEwj8gJWEyYvGAhXBjpIKHV8sAIk#v=onepage&amp;q=crane%20ordway%20building%20st%20paul&amp;f=false ''The Valve World'', (Justin W. McEachren), Crane Company, 1922]&lt;/ref&gt; uniting all the large interests in this line of business in the Northwest. Lucius Ordway, became vice president and general manager of Crane &amp; Ordway. Ordway came to St. Paul from Providence, E. I., in 1883 and worked for Wilson &amp; Kogers until 1886, when he became a member of the firm of Rogers &amp; Ordway,

The company dealt in a general line of pipe, fittings, boilers, pumps, pumping machinery, and plumbers' and steam-fitters' supplies.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=NMEcAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PP6&amp;lpg=PP6&amp;dq=crane+ordway+building+st+paul&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=4ns4SSWC5q&amp;sig=htMMbGEb2eivF1UL_jZmKGg1Q6U&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAjgoahUKEwiU-YyR0ovGAhWCQpIKHQY_AKA#v=onepage&amp;q=crane%20ordway%20building%20st%20paul&amp;f=false ''Western Magazine'', January, 1921]&lt;/ref&gt; It did an extensive business in well-drilling machinery, windmills, and large irrigating plant outfits of all descriptions, furnishing estimates and designs and complete plans for water works. Crane later became part of [[American Standard Brands|American Standard]]. Mr. Ordway went on to help build the [[3M]] company.

The building, completed in 1904, was designed by [[Reed and Stem]], the architectural firm that designed [[Grand Central Terminal]] in New York and the St. Paul Hotel in downtown St. Paul. It had been vacant for 30 years prior to Aeon, a non-profit developer of affordable housing, restoring it in 2006. The historic warehouse now offers 70 units of affordable rental apartments.

==Neighborhood architects==
Architects who contributed to the neighborhood include [[Cass Gilbert]], [[J. Walter Stevens]], and [[Charles Sumner Frost]].{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

As of 2010, scientists had studied more than 150 marine reserves in at least 61 countries and monitored biological changes inside the reserves.

== Design ==

A review of studies of 34 families (210 species) of coral reef fishes demonstrates that the design of a marine reserve has important implications for its ability to protect habitat and focal species.&lt;ref name=green1&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Biological Reviews

=== Size and shape ===
Effective reserves included habitats that support the life history of focal species (e.g. home ranges, nursery grounds, migration corridors and spawning aggregations), and were located to accommodate movement patterns among them.&lt;ref name="green1" /&gt;

Movement patterns (home ranges, [[ontogenetic]] shifts and spawning migrations) vary among and within species, and are influenced by factors such as size, sex, behaviour, density, habitat characteristics, season, tide and time of day. For example, damselfishes, butterflyfishes and angelfishes travel &lt;0.1–0.5&amp;nbsp;km, while some sharks and tuna migrate over thousands of kilometres. Larval dispersal distances tend to be &lt;5–15&amp;nbsp;km, and self-recruitment to new habitat is common.&lt;ref name="green1"/&gt;

The review indicated that effective marine reserves are more than twice the size of the home range of focal/target species (in all directions). The presence of effective marine management outside the reserve may allow smaller reserves.&lt;ref name="green1" /&gt; Reserve size recommendations apply to the specific habitats of focal species, not the overall size. For example, coral reef species require coral reef habitats rather than open ocean or seagrass beds.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

Marine reserve whose boundaries are extensively fished benefit from compact shapes (e.g., squares or circles rather than elongated rectangles). Including whole ecological units (e.g., an offshore reef) can reduce exports where that is desired.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

=== Habitats ===
Minimum sustainable population sizes have not been determined for most marine populations. Instead, fisheries ecologists use the fraction of unfished stock levels as a proxy. Meta-analyses suggest that maintaining populations above ∼37% of those levels generally ensures stable populations, although variations in fishing pressure allow fractions as small as 10% or as large as 40% (to protect species such as sharks and some grouper that have lower reproductive output or slower maturation). Higher fractions of habitat protection may protect areas vulnerable to disturbances such as typhoons or climate change. 20–30% protection can achieve fisheries objectives in areas with controlled fishing pressure and is the minimum level of habitat protection recommended by [[IUCN]]-[[World Commission on Protected Areas|WCPA]].

=== Special areas ===
Many fish species congregate to facilitate spawning. Such congregations are spatially and temporally predictable and increase the species' vulnerability to overfishing. Species such as groupers and rabbitfishes travel long distances to congregate for days or weeks. Such gatherings are their only opportunities to reproduce and are crucial to population maintenance. Species such as snappers and parrotfishes congregate in feeding or resting areas. Juveniles may congregate in nursery areas without adults. Such special areas may require only seasonal protections if at other times no vital activities are taking place. Such reserves must be spaced to allow focal species to journey among them. If the location of such special areas is unknown, or is too large to include in a reserve, management approaches such as seasonal capture and sales restrictions may provide some protection. [[Sea turtle]] nesting areas, [[dugong]] feeding areas, [[cetacean]] migratory corridors and calving grounds are examples of other special areas that can be protected seasonally. Other types of special areas include isolated habitats that have unique assemblages and populations, habitats that are important for [[endemic species]] and highly diverse areas.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

=== Isolated populations ===
Isolated populations (e.g.,those on  remote [[atolls]])  have high conservation value where they harbor endemic species and/or unique assemblages. A location or population 20–30&amp;nbsp;km from its nearest neighbor generally qualifies as isolated in the absence of a persistent linking current. Their isolation (low connectivity) requires such areas to be largely self-replenishing. This leaves them less resilient to disturbance. Sustaining their marine species requires a higher fraction of living areas to be protected.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Recovery ===
Coral reef fish species recovery rates (from e.g., overfishing) depend on their life history and factors such as ecological characteristics, fishing intensity and population size. In the [[Coral Triangle]], species at lower [[trophic levels]] that have smaller maximum sizes, faster growth and maturation rates and shorter life spans tend to recover more quickly than species having the opposite characteristics. For example, in the Philippines, populations of planktivores (e.g., fusiliers) and some herbivores (e.g., parrotfishes) recovered in ''&lt;''5–10 years in marine reserves, while predators (e.g., groupers) took 20–40 years.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Increased fishing pressure adversely affects recovery rates (e.g., Great Barrier Reef and Papua New Guinea).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Long-term protection allows species with slower recovery rates to achieve and maintain ecosystem health and associated fishery benefits. Permanent protection protects these species over the long-term. Short-term protections do not allow slow-recovering species to reach or maintain stable populations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In some Coral Triangle countries (e.g., Papua New Guinea and Solomon Islands), short term protections are the most common form of traditional marine resource management. These protections can help address problems at lower trophic levels (e.g., herbivores) or allow spawning to succeed. Other reasons for adopting short-term protections include allowing communities to stockpile resources for feasts or close areas for cultural reasons. Short-term/periodic reserves also may function as partial insurance by enhancing overall ecosystem resilience against catastrophes. Reopened reserves can be protected by management controls that limit the harvest to less than the increase achieved during closure, although at greatly reduced recovery rates.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Resilience ===
Some habitats and species are better prepared environmental changes or extremes. These include coral communities that handle high sea surface temperature (SST); areas with variable SSTs and carbonate chemistry and areas adjacent to undeveloped low-lying inland areas that coastal habitats can expand into as [[sea levels]] rise. Such areas constitute [[climate change]] refugia and can potentially better protect biodiversity than more fragile areas. They may also provide fishery benefits, since habitat loss from climate change is a major fishery threat.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Local practices ===
Local practices such as overfishing, blast fishing, trawling, coastal development and pollution threaten many marine habitats. These threats decrease ecosystem health and productivity and adversely affect focal and other species. Such practices can also decrease resilience. Some practices that originate beyond reserve boundaries (e.g., [[Surface runoff|runoff]]) can be mitigated by considering their impacts within broader management frameworks. Areas that are not threatened by such practices and that are adjacent to other unthreatening areas may be better choices for reserves.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Networks ==
Networks of marine reserves can support both [[fisheries management]] and [[biodiversity conservation]]. The size, spacing and location of reserves within a network must respect larval dispersal and movement patterns of species that are targeted for protection.&lt;ref name="green1" /&gt;

=== Design ===
Existing ecological guidelines for designing networks independently focus on achieving either fisheries, biodiversity or climate change objectives or combinations of fisheries and biodiversity or biodiversity and climate change. These three goals have different implications for network design. The most important are reserve size and protection duration (permanent, long term, short term, or periodic closures).&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

==== Diversity ====
Maintaining diversity involves protecting all species. Generally this involves protecting adequate examples of each major habitat (e.g., each type of coral reef, mangrove and seagrass community). Resiliency to threats improves when multiple examples of each habitat are protected.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

To address biodiversity or climate change, reserves 4–20&amp;nbsp;km across are recommended, because they protect larger populations of more species.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Climate change ===
Protecting areas that have already proven resilient to ecological changes and/or are relatively well-protected by other protocols are likely to better survive climate change as well.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Fisheries ====
Reserves 0.5–1&amp;nbsp;km across export more adults and larvae to fished areas, potentially increasing recruitment and stock replenishment there. Such small reserves are common in the [[Coral Triangle]], where they benefited some fisheries.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

=== Connectivity ===
Connectivity is the linking of local populations through the (voluntary) dispersal of individuals. Connected reserves are close enough to each other that larvae, juveniles or adults can cross from one to another as their behavior patterns dictate. Connectivity is a key factor in network design, since it allows a disturbed reserve to recover by recruiting individuals from other, potentially overpopulated, reserves. Effective networks spaced reserves at distances of &lt;15&amp;nbsp;km from each other, with smaller reserves spaced more closely.&lt;ref name="green1" /&gt;

Most coastal fish species have a bipartite life cycle where larvae are [[pelagic]] before settling out of the [[plankton]] to live on a reef. While these fish travel varying distances during their life history, their larvae have the potential to move 10s–100s of km, more than the more sedentary adults and juveniles, which have home ranges of &lt;1 m to a few km. Adults and juveniles of some species travel 10s–100s of kilometers as they mature to reach appropriate habitats (e.g., such as coral reef, mangrove and seagrass habitats) or to migrate to spawning areas. When adults and juveniles leave a marine reserve, they become vulnerable to fishing. However, larvae can generally leave a reserve without elevated risk because of their small size and limited fishery exposure. Effective networks account for the movement patterns of target species at each life cycle stage.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

Given a strong, consistent current, siting marine reserves upstream increases downstream populations.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

==Market terminology==
{{more|Bull (stock market speculator)}}
The terms "bull market" and "bear market" describe upward and downward market trends, respectively,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Preis | first = Tobias | last2 = Stanley | first2 = H. Eugene | title = Bubble trouble: Can a Law Describe Bubbles and Crashes in Financial Markets? | journal = [[Physics World]] | volume = 24 | pages = 29–32 | year = 2011 | doi = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and can be used to describe either the market as a whole or specific sectors and securities.&lt;ref name=Edwards/&gt; The names perhaps correspond to the fact that a [[bull]] attacks by lifting its horns upward, while a [[bear]] strikes with its claws in a downward motion.&lt;ref name="Fontanillsetal2001"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Investopedia"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bullmarket.asp |title=Bull Market |accessdate=2016-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Secular trends==
A secular market trend is a long-term trend that lasts 5 to 25 years and consists of a series of primary trends. A secular bear market consists of smaller bull markets and larger bear markets; a secular bull market consists of larger bull markets and smaller bear markets.

In a secular bull market the prevailing trend is "bullish" or upward-moving. The United States stock market was described as being in a secular bull market from about 1983 to 2000 (or 2007), with brief upsets including the [[Black Monday (1987)|crash of 1987]] and the market collapse of 2000–2002 triggered by the [[dot-com bubble]].

In a secular bear market, the prevailing trend is "bearish" or downward-moving. An example of a secular bear market occurred in [[gold]] between January 1980 to June 1999, culminating with the [[Brown Bottom]]. During this period the nominal gold price fell from a high of $850/oz ($30/g) to a low of $253/oz ($9/g),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kitco.com/LFgif/au968-999.gif Chart of gold 1968–99]&lt;/ref&gt; and became part of the [[Great Commodities Depression]].

==Primary trends==
{{anchor|Primary trends}}
[[File:Bulle und Bär Frankfurt.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Statues of the two symbolic beasts of finance, the bear and the bull, in front of the [[Frankfurt Stock Exchange]].]]
A primary trend has broad support throughout the entire market (most [[Sector (economic)|sectors]]) and lasts for a year or more.

A bull market is a period of generally rising prices. The start of a bull market is marked by widespread pessimism. This point is when the "crowd" is the most "bearish".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=MW_FmuvcneEC&amp;pg=PT222&amp;lpg=PT222#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Winning on Wall Street] Martin Zweig&lt;/ref&gt; The feeling of despondency changes to hope, "optimism", and eventually euphoria, as the bull runs its course.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.minyanville.com/business-news/markets/articles/The-6-Stages-of-Bull-Markets/4/1/2013/id/48996 The 6 Stages Of Bull Markets -- And Where We Are Right Now | Markets | Minyanville's Wall Street] [[Minyanville]]&lt;/ref&gt; This often leads the economic cycle, for example in a full [[recession]], or earlier.

An analysis of [[Morningstar, Inc.]] stock market data from 1926 to 2014 found that a typical bull market "lasted 8.5 years
with an average cumulative total return of 458%", while annualized gains for bull markets range from 14.9% to 34.1%.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.feltzwealthplan.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/compliance-Bull-and-Bear-Markets-chart-Oct-2014.pdf History of U.S. Bear and Bull Markets Since 1926] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160509115004/http://www.feltzwealthplan.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/compliance-Bull-and-Bear-Markets-chart-Oct-2014.pdf |date=2016-05-09 }}", chart by First Trust Portfolios L.P., accessed 01 May 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

====Examples====
:India's [[Bombay Stock Exchange]] Index, [[BSE SENSEX]], had a major bull market trend for about five years from April 2003 to January 2008 as it increased from 2,900 points to 21,000 points, more than a 6-fold rise in 5 years.
:Notable bull markets marked the 1925–1929, 1953–1957 and the 1993–1997 periods when the U.S. and many other stock markets rose; while the first period ended abruptly with the start of the [[Great Depression]], the end of the later time periods were mostly periods of [[Soft landing (economics)|soft landing]], which became large bear markets. (see: [[Recession of 1960–61]] and the [[dot-com bubble]] in 2000–2001)

===Bear market===
A bear market is a general decline in the stock market over a period of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

According to [[The Vanguard Group]], "While there's no agreed-upon definition of a bear market, one generally accepted measure is a price decline of 20% or more over at least a two-month period."&lt;ref&gt;"[https://retirementplans.vanguard.com/VGApp/pe/PubVgiNews?ArticleName=Stayingcalmbearmkt Staying calm during a bear market] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717184619/https://retirementplans.vanguard.com/VGApp/pe/PubVgiNews?ArticleName=Stayingcalmbearmkt |date=2011-07-17 }}". Vanguard Group.&lt;/ref&gt;

A smaller decline of 10 to 20% is considered a correction. Once a market enters correction or bear market territory, it isn't considered to have exited that territory until a new high is reached.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.marketwatch.com/story/stop-saying-the-dow-is-moving-in-and-out-of-correction-that-is-not-how-stock-market-moves-work-2018-03-23|title=Stop saying the Dow is moving in and out of correction!

An analysis of [[Morningstar, Inc.]] stock market data from 1926 to 2014 found that a typical bear market "lasted 1.3 years
with an average cumulative loss of −41%", while annualized declines for bear markets range from −19.7% to −47%.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.feltzwealthplan.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/compliance-Bull-and-Bear-Markets-chart-Oct-2014.pdf History of U.S. Bear and Bull Markets Since 1926] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160509115004/http://www.feltzwealthplan.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/compliance-Bull-and-Bear-Markets-chart-Oct-2014.pdf |date=2016-05-09 }}", chart by First Trust Portfolios L.P., accessed 01 May 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

====Examples====
:A bear market followed the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]] and erased 89% (from 386 to 40) of the [[Dow Jones Industrial Average]]'s market capitalization by July 1932, marking the start of the [[Great Depression]].  After regaining nearly 50% of its losses, a longer bear market from 1937 to 1942 occurred in which the market was again cut in half.  Another long-term bear market occurred from about 1973 to 1982, encompassing the [[1970s energy crisis]] and the high unemployment of the early 1980s. Yet another bear market occurred between March 2000 and October 2002. Recent examples occurred between October 2007 and March 2009, as a result of the [[financial crisis of 2007–2008]]. See also [[2015 Chinese stock market crash]].

===Market top===
A market top (or market high) is usually not a dramatic event. The market has simply reached the highest point that it will, for some time (usually a few years). It is retroactively defined as market participants are not aware of it as it happens.
A decline then follows, usually gradually at first and later with more rapidity.
William J. O'Neil and company report that since the 1950s a market top is characterized by three to five distribution days in a major market index occurring within a relatively short period of time. Distribution is a decline in price with higher volume than the preceding session.

====Examples====
:The peak of the [[dot-com bubble]] (as measured by the [[NASDAQ-100]]) occurred on March 24, 2000. The index closed at 4,704.73.  The Nasdaq peaked at 5,132.50 and the S&amp;P 500 at 1525.20.

A recent peak for the broad U.S. market was October 9, 2007.  The [[S&amp;P 500]] index closed at 1,565 and the Nasdaq at 2861.50.

===Market bottom===
A market bottom is a trend reversal, the end of a market downturn, and the beginning of an upward moving trend (bull market).

It is very difficult to identify a bottom (referred to by investors as "bottom picking") while it is occurring. The upturn following a decline is often short-lived and prices might resume their decline. This would bring a loss for the investor who purchased stock(s) during a misperceived or "false" market bottom.

[[Baron Rothschild]] is said to have advised that the best time to buy is when there is "blood in the streets", i.e., when the markets have fallen drastically and investor sentiment is extremely negative.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fool.com/investing/small-cap/2007/05/02/buy-when-theres-blood-in-the-streets.aspx Buy When There's Blood in the Streets]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Examples====
:Some examples of market bottoms, in terms of the closing values of the [[Dow Jones Industrial Average]] (DJIA) include:
:*The Dow Jones Industrial Average hit a bottom at 1738.74 on 19 October 1987, as a result of the decline from 2722.41 on 25 August 1987. This day was called Black Monday (chart&lt;ref&gt;[http://stockcharts.com/h-sc/ui?s=$INDU&amp;p=D&amp;st=1987-08-01&amp;en=1987-12-31&amp;id=p95907824619 stockcharts.com chart]&lt;/ref&gt;).
:* A bottom of 7286.27 was reached on the DJIA on 9 October 2002 as a result of the decline from 11722.98 on 14 January 2000. This included an intermediate bottom of 8235.81 on 21 September 2001 (a 14% change from 10 September) which led to an intermediate top of 10635.25 on 19 March 2002 (chart&lt;ref&gt;[http://stockcharts.com/h-sc/ui?s=$INDU&amp;p=D&amp;st=2000-01-01&amp;en=2002-12-31&amp;id=p94927308656 stockcharts.com chart]&lt;/ref&gt;). The "tech-heavy" Nasdaq fell a more precipitous 79% from its 5132 peak (10 March 2000) to its 1108 bottom (10 October 2002).

:*A bottom of 6,440.08 (DJIA) on 9 March 2009 was reached after a decline associated with the [[subprime mortgage crisis]] starting at 14164.41 on 9 October 2007 (chart&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stockcharts.com/h-sc/ui?s=$INDU&amp;p=D&amp;st=2007-06-01&amp;en=2009-05-17&amp;id=p70946023540 |title=$INDU - SharpCharts Workbench |publisher=StockCharts.com |date= |accessdate=2014-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

==Secondary trends==
Secondary trends are short-term changes in price direction within a primary trend.  They may last for a few weeks or a few months.

One type of secondary market trend is called a market '''correction'''. A correction is a short-term price decline of 5% to 20% or so.&lt;ref&gt;Technical Analysis of Stock Trends, Robert D. Edwards and John Magee p. 479.&lt;/ref&gt; An example occurred from April to June 2010, when the [[S&amp;P 500]] went from above 1200 to near 1000; this was hailed{{by whom?|date=June 2018}} as the end of the bull market and start of a bear market, but it was not, and the market turned back up. A correction is a downward movement that is not large enough to be a bear market (ex post).

Another type of secondary trend is called a '''bear [[Rally (stock market)|market rally]]''' (sometimes called "sucker's rally" or "[[dead cat bounce]]") which consists of a market-price increase of only 10% or 20% before the prevailing, bear-market trend resumes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bear-market-rally.asp|title= Bear Market Rally Definition|publisher= Investopedia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bear market rallies occurred in the [[Dow Jones Industrial Average |Dow Jones]] index after the 1929 stock market crash, leading down to the market bottom in 1932, and throughout the late 1960s and early 1970s. The [[Japan]]ese [[Nikkei 225]] has tracked a number of bear-market rallies since the late 1980s while experiencing an overall long-term downward trend.

==Causes==

The price of assets such as stocks is set by supply and demand. By definition, the market balances buyers and sellers, so it's impossible to literally have 'more buyers than sellers' or vice versa, although that is a common expression. For a surge in demand, the buyers will increase the price they are willing to pay, while the sellers will increase the price they wish to receive. For a surge in supply, the opposite happens.

Supply and demand are created when investors shift allocation of investment between asset types. For example, at one time, investors may move money from government bonds to "tech" stocks; at another time, they may move money from "tech" stocks to government bonds. In each case, this will affect the price of both types of assets.

Generally, investors try to follow a [[Market timing|buy-low, sell-high]] strategy but often mistakenly end up buying high and selling low.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.morningstar.com/articlenet/article.aspx?id=325664 Bad Timing Eats Away at Investor Returns]&lt;/ref&gt; Contrarian investors and traders attempt to "fade" the investors' actions (buy when they are selling, sell when they are buying). A time when most investors are selling stocks is known as distribution, while a time when most investors are buying stocks is known as accumulation.

According to standard theory, a decrease in price will result in less supply and more demand,
while an increase in price will do the opposite. This works well for most assets but it often works in reverse for stocks due to the mistake many investors make of buying high in a state of euphoria and selling low in a state of fear or panic as a result of the herding instinct. In case an increase in price causes an increase in demand, or a decrease in price causes an increase in supply, this destroys the expected negative feedback loop and prices will be unstable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wilcox|first1=Jarrod W.|last2=Fabozzi|first2=Frank J.|title=Financial Advice and Investment Decisions: A Manifesto for Change|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mnEnAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT58#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be seen in a bubble or crash.

==Investor sentiment==
Investor sentiment is a [[contrarian]] stock market indicator.

When a high proportion of investors express a bearish (negative) sentiment, some analysts consider it to be a strong signal that a market bottom may be near. The predictive capability of such a signal (see also [[market sentiment]]) is thought to be highest when investor sentiment reaches extreme values.&lt;ref&gt;Trying to Plumb a Bottom, By MARK HULBERT, http://online.barrons.com/article/SB122652105098621685.html&lt;/ref&gt; Indicators that measure investor sentiment may include:{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

[[David Hirshleifer]] sees in the trend phenomenon a path starting with underreaction and ending in overreaction by investors / traders.

*Investor Intelligence Sentiment Index: If the Bull-Bear spread (% of Bulls − % of Bears) is close to a historic low, it may signal a bottom. Typically, the number of bears surveyed would exceed the number of bulls. However, if the number of bulls is at an extreme high and the number of bears is at an extreme low, historically, a market top may have occurred or is close to occurring. This contrarian measure is more reliable for its coincidental timing at market lows than tops.
*[[American Association of Individual Investors]] (AAII) sentiment indicator: Many feel that the majority of the decline has already occurred once this indicator gives a reading of minus 15% or below.
*Other sentiment indicators include the Nova-Ursa ratio, the Short Interest/Total Market Float, and the [[put/call ratio]].

'''''Compañía Mexicana de Petróleo El Águila SA''''', (''El Águila'' for short{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}), called in English the '''Mexican Eagle Oil Company''' or '''Mexican Eagle Petroleum Corporation''', was a Mexican oil company in the 20th century.

==History==
[[File:1st Viscount Cowdray.jpg|thumb|Weetman Pearson, Viscount Cowdray]]
Sir [[Weetman Pearson, 1st Viscount Cowdray|Weetman Pearson]], [[Baronet|Bart.]] ([[Viscount Cowdray]] from 1910) founded the company in 1909 to develop his investments in the [[Petroleum industry in Mexico|Mexican oil fields]].

Pearson's interests in Mexico had begun in 1889 when he won a contract from the government of [[Porfirio Díaz]] for his civil engineering company, S. Pearson and Sons Ltd, to build the Gran Canal in [[Mexico City]].{{sfn|Godley|2007|pp=6, 7}} This was followed by contracts in 1895 to build a [[Veracruz, Veracruz#The port|harbour at Veracruz]] and in 1896 to build the [[Ferrocarril Transistmico|Tehuantepec Railway]].{{sfn|Godley|2007|p=8}} Pearson diversified into mining, landholding, transport and electrical utilities around Veracruz.{{sfn|Godley|2007|p=8}} He and the engineer [[Frederick Stark Pearson|F.S. Pearson]] (no relation) founded the Mexico Power and Light Company, which provided Mexico City's first public electricity supply.{{sfn|Godley|2007|p=8}} Pearson's businesses and government contracts put him in a favourable position with members of the Díaz dictatorship.{{sfn|Godley|2007|p=8}}

Oil production in Mexico was begun in 1901 by a US oil investor, [[Henry Clay Pierce]].{{sfn|Godley|2007|p=11}} He was quickly followed by a rival, [[Edward L. Doheny]], in the same year.{{sfn|Godley|2007|p=11}} Pearson's land surveys in the vicinities of Pedregal and San Cristóbal for the route of the Tehuantepec Railway had reported oil seepage from the ground, so in April 1901 he ordered his manager in Mexico to secure prospecting options on ''"...all land for miles around"''.{{sfn|Godley|2007|p=12}} Pearson built a refinery, pipelines and port facilities to handle the oil in 1905–06, but his company didn't make a major oil strike until 1908.{{sfn|Godley|2007|p=13}} In the same year one of Pearson's oil strikes caught fire and burned out of control for eight weeks, destroying the entire [[oil field]].{{sfn|Godley|2007|p=13}}

In 1909 Pearson founded the ''Compañía Mexicana de Petróleo El Aguila SA'' ("Mexican Eagle Oil Company") in Mexico to take over S. Pearson and Sons' oil interests.{{sfn|Godley|2007|p=15}} This followed Pearson's creation of Whitehall Securities Corporation Ltd. in the UK in 1908 to manage all of S. Pearson and Sons' investments outside the oil industry.{{sfn|Godley|2007|p=16}} Pearson's prospecting continued without success until 27 December 1910, when a well on the [[Gulf of Mexico]] coast between Veracruz and [[Tampico, Tamaulipas|Tampico]] struck oil that flowed at a rate of 100,000 [[Barrel (unit)#Oil barrel|barrels]] per day.{{sfn|Godley|2007|p=14}} This single well turned the fortunes of Pearson's oil business. Within a few years he was one of Mexico's two major oil magnates, the other being Doheny.{{sfn|Godley|2007|p=14}} Other oil companies from the USA and Europe had entered the Mexican oil industry but Doheny and Pearson's companies remained pre-eminent until after the [[World War I|First World War]].{{sfn|Godley|2007|p=14}}

In 1911 the [[Mexican revolution]] overthrew the Díaz dictatorship that had favoured Pearson, ending the civil engineering contracts for which he had first become involved in Mexico.{{sfn|Godley|2007|p=25}} However, Pearson had exclusive rights to prospect for oil in several Mexican states&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Watkins |first=Thayer |title=The Petroleum Industry of Mexico |publisher=[[San José State University]] |url= http://www.sjsu.edu/faculty/watkins/pemex1.htm |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by 1914 the company {{convert|1500000|acre|km2}} of prospecting rights, {{convert|175|mi|abbr=off}} of pipeline, two refineries (the second being newly built at Tampico) and storage for seven million barrels of oil.{{sfn|Godley|2007|p=14}}

By June 1913 Mexican Eagle was the largest company in the Pearson group, with net assets valued at £6.8 million.{{sfn|Godley|2007|p=18}} However, in December 1918 Pearson claimed in a letter to the UK [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]], [[David Lloyd George]], that Mexican Eagle was worth £8 million.{{sfn|Godley|2007|p=18}} Mexican Eagle was the largest contributor to the Pearson group's valuation in 1913 of £17 million, which made it the seventh largest business in the UK and among the 30 largest businesses in the World.{{sfn|Godley|2007|p=19}} By 1919 the Pearson group was worth £29.6 million, of which in June of that year Mexican Eagle made up £13.4 million.{{sfn|Godley|2007|p=19}} To what extent this represents a growth in value must be considered against the degree of inflation that took place in the First World War.{{sfn|Godley|2007|p=20}} However, in 1919 the Pearson group's share value was £79.1 million, of which Mexican Eagle made up £62.6 million.{{sfn|Godley|2007|p=22}} This made Mexican Eagle roughly the equal of [[Burmah Oil]] and far bigger than the [[Anglo-Persian Oil Company]] or Shell Transport and Trading.{{sfn|Godley|2007|p=23}}

==Buyout offers and eventual sale==
In 1911 Pearson declined an offer from the [[Texaco|Texas Oil Company]] offered to buy his oil interests.{{sfn|Godley|2007|p=26}} In 1912 and 1913 he declined buyout bids from [[Royal Dutch Shell]].{{sfn|Godley|2007|p=26}} and in 1913 and 1916 he declined bids from [[Esso|Standard Oil of New Jersey]].{{sfn|Godley|2007|p=26}} By 1916 Pearson was keen to sell, but the UK Government persuaded him for strategic reasons not to do so.{{sfn|Godley|2007|p=26}} Pearson asked the UK Government to buy 50% of his oil interests, but it responded in 1917 by imposing restrictions that prevented him from transferring ownership as long as the war continued.{{sfn|Godley|2007|p=26}} The [[Constitution of Mexico]] adopted in 1917 nationalised oil deposits.{{sfn|Godley|2007|p=26}}

In October 1918, a month before the [[Armistice with Germany|Armistice]], [[Calouste Gulbenkian]] started negotiations with Pearson for Royal Dutch Shell to buy Mexican Eagle.{{sfn|Godley|2007|p=1}} On April 2, 1919{{sfn|Godley|2007|p=1}} the Royal Dutch Petroleum Company and the "Shell" Transport and Trading Company&lt;!-- The quotes around "Shell" were in the UK parent's legal name; DO NOT remove them. --&gt; jointly bought Mexican Eagle for [[United States dollar|US$]]75 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1919/03/15/97086178.pdf |title= $75,000,000 Oil Deal. Royal Dutch and Shell Companies Buy Mexican Eagle Stock |newspaper=[[New York Times]] |date=1919-03-15 |accessdate=}}''Though the reference says "Shell Oil Company", now the name of [[Shell Oil Company|Royal Dutch Shell's U.S. subsidiary]], it also says the price was split 60% Royal Dutch/40% Shell, the exact split of the 1907-2005 Royal Dutch – "Shell" Transport joint venture (and their 2005 merger). Thus the 40% buyer must have been "Shell" Transport, not Shell Oil Company.''&lt;/ref&gt;

Mexican Eagle was the dominant firm in the Mexican petroleum industry until March 18, 1938, when the government of [[Lázaro Cárdenas]] nationalized it, along with all other foreign-owned oil interests, to create ''Petróleos Mexicanos'' ([[Pemex]]).

''El Aguila'' formally dissolved itself on May 24, 1963.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Kennedy |first=Paul P. |url= http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F20715FE3958137A93C7AB178ED85F478685F9 |title= Big Oil Company Closes Its Books; El Aguila of Mexico Holders Vote to Dissolve |newspaper=[[New York Times]] |date=1963-05-25 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Eagle Oil and Shipping Company==
{{main|Eagle Oil and Shipping Company}}
Pearson started to acquire [[History of the oil tanker#Breaking the Standard Oil monopoly|steam tankers]] to carry the oil that he hoped to produce. [[Armstrong Whitworth]] on the [[River Tyne]] launched SS ''San Cristobal'' (2,041 tons) in 1906 and [[Swan Hunter]], also on Tyneside, launched SS ''San Antonio'' (5,251 tons) in 1909. Pearson also bought SS ''James Brand'' (3,907 tons), which had been built by Armstrong Whitworth in 1893, and renamed her ''San Bernardo''.

In 1912 Pearson founded the [[Eagle Oil and Shipping Company|Eagle Oil Transport Company]] in the UK to take over his ships and carry Mexican Eagle's products&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= [[Marconi Company|Marconi Transatlantic Wireless Telegraph]] |date=1912-02-29 |newspaper=[[New York Times]] |title= Form $5,000,000 Line.; Cowdray Interests to Build Fleet to Carry Mexican Oil Products |url= https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9B0CE1DB123BE633A2575AC2A9649C946396D6CF |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the '''Anglo-Mexican Petroleum Company''' in the UK to sell Mexican Eagle's products outside Mexico.{{sfn|Godley|2007|pp=15, 16}}

Eagle Oil Transport immediately ordered 20 modern steam tankers{{sfn|Godley|2007|p=15}} at a cost of [[Pound sterling|£]]3 million.{{sfn|Godley|2007|p=18}} Eagle Oil Transport lost a number of ships to enemy action in the First World War. After the First World War, Eagle Oil Transport renewed and expanded its fleet. It bought numerous new tankers, including six of about 13,000 tons each. When Royal Dutch Shell bought Pearson's oil interests, that included Eagle Oil Transport and Anglo-Saxon Petroleum as well as Mexical Eagle Petroleum.

In about 1930 the Eagle Oil Transport Company was renamed the [[Eagle Oil and Shipping Company]]. In about 1935 the company started adding a new generation of motor tankers of about 8,000 tons each.&lt;ref name=Lloyds1940&gt;{{cite book |title=Lloyd's Register of Shipping |year=1935 |publisher=[[Lloyd's of London]] |location=London |page= |accessdate=2011-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eagle Oil and Shipping was registered in the United Kingdom. Therefore, after 1938 although the Mexican government had nationalised Mexican Eagle Petroleum, Eagle Oil and Shipping remained a subsidiary of Royal Dutch Shell. After 1938 the fleet continued to carry oil from the [[Gulf of Mexico]] to the UK.{{sfn|Talbot-Booth|1942|p=461}} During the [[World War II|Second World War]] the company played an important role in supplying petroleum and petroleum products to the United Kingdom. Oil tankers were a particular target in Germany's economic warfare against the UK. Enemy action sank 17 Eagle Oil's ships and killed at least 206 officers, men and [[Defensively Equipped Merchant Ships#World War II|DEMS]] gunners serving aboard them.

[[File:MT SAN DEMETRIO.jpg|thumb|300px|{{MV|San Demetrio}} reached the Clyde in 1940 with a cargo of aviation spirit despite having been damaged by shellfire from the ''Admiral Scheer'']]
Among the ships lost was {{MV|San Demetrio}} (8,073 tons), which was famous for surviving a naval bombardment by the German [[heavy cruiser]] ''[[German cruiser Admiral Scheer|Admiral Scheer]]'' in 1940 that set the tanker on fire. ''San Demetrio'' was repaired and returned to service, but the [[U-boat]] [[German submarine U-404|U-''404'']] torpedoed and sank her in the western Atlantic off [[Virginia]] in 1942 with the loss of 19 lives.

In 1942 the [[Ministry of War Transport]] placed a number of [[Empire ship#Tankers|Empire ships]] under Eagle Oil and Shipping's management. One was sunk by enemy action in 1943&lt;ref name=WreckSiteNorseman&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wrecksite.eu/wreck.aspx?30614 |title=SS Empire Norseman [+1943] |last1=Claes |first1=Johnny |last2=Vleggeert |first2=Nico |date=2010-01-23 |work=The Wreck Site |publisher= |accessdate=2011-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; but after the war the company bought two of the surviving ships from the ministry. The company also bought two [[T2 tanker]]s that had been built in the USA. The company further renewed its fleet with 16 new ships between 1950 and 1960, and maximum tonnages steadily rose towards the end of the decade. The Royal Dutch Shell parent group absorbed Eagle Oil and Shipping in 1959.

Founded in 2013, Pakathon aims to create jobs through innovation and entrepreneurship&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/malik-siraj-akbar/pakathon-searching-soluti_b_8248982.html|title=Pakathon: Searching for Solutions Through Business and Technology|last=Akbar|first=Malik Siraj|date=October 6, 2015|work=|access-date=April 5, 2016|via=Huffington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; by mobilizing the [[Pakistani diaspora]]. By working to foster a global network of like-minded individuals, investors and entrepreneurs, Pakathon aims to solve problems in sectors such as education, healthcare, gender equality, energy and law.

== Introduction ==
The organization's flagship event is a weekend-long [[hackathon]] hosted in chapter cities where students and professionals develop and pitch their projects to a panel of mentors. Top-performing teams are then invited to present their ideas to a global audience where they compete for funding, mentorship, and additional support, with the aim of advancing their ideas from conception to reality. Two winning teams are then selected: one from Pakistan and another from the international host cities.

In 2015, Pakathon partnered with the [[Higher Education Commission of Pakistan]] to expand Pakathon's innovation-centred programming in up to 50 Pakistani universities.

== Impact ==
Pakathon's first winning team conceived the idea for ProCheck, a serialization system for authentic medicines in Pakistan. ProCheck allows customers and patients to verify authentic medicines using their mobile phones via text messaging. In November, 2015 ProCheck partnered with Ferozsons Labs, a leading manufacturer of pharmaceuticals in Pakistan, to serialize 35 million units of medicine using ProCheck's track and trace solution. As a result, more than 50,000 patients across the country will be able to distinguish between genuine and counterfeit medicines.

== Overview ==
Patrice Baldwin is a leading figure in the world of 'Drama for Learning'.  She was Chair of National Drama (the leading association of drama and theatre educators) for more than a decade (until November 2014) and was President of the International Drama Theatre and Education Association (IDEA) from 2010 – 2013. She has also been an Executive Council Member of the World Alliance for Arts Education (WAAE). From April 2000 to June 2011 she was the local authority arts adviser for [[Norfolk County Council]] Children's Services but decided to go freelance in June 2011. This enabled her to devote more time to travelling and working abroad, as well as to developing 'Drama for Learning' in the UK.  Follow her extensive education work, publications and travels by visiting her Drama Blog [http://www.patricebaldwin.me] and her professional website [http://www.patricebaldwin.net]    You can also join the D4LC Facebook group she set up,  to keep in contact with thousands of drama educators worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.facebook.com/#!/groups/233552658275/?fref=ts]&lt;/ref&gt;    

Patrice was a primary school headteacher for eleven years and still works in schools on a consultancy basis for drama for learning, improving teaching, cultural and creative learning and primary curriculum development. She was an [[Ofsted]] inspector and a School Improvement Partner.  For several years she worked as a BBC series consultant and scriptwriter for ''Let's Make a Story'' and also wrote scripts for ''First Steps in Drama'' and stories and dramatisations for ''Together'', a BBC radio assembly programme for primary schools. 

Patrice Baldwin has written many articles and books for teachers, on the use of drama for learning across the curriculum and has a particular interest in links between drama, learning through imagining and neuroscience, She is also known for her work on improving literacy through Drama.  She is author of 'Stimulating Drama', ''The Drama Box'', 'The Drama Book', 'Teaching Literacy Through Drama – creative approaches'&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wwwords.co.uk/pdf/viewpdf.asp?j=forum&amp;vol=44&amp;issue=3&amp;year=2002&amp;article=Forum_44-3_CoreContent&amp;id=70.15.67.69&lt;/ref&gt; and ''With Drama in Mind – real learning in imagined worlds'' and The Primary Drama Handbook' and 'School Improvement Through Drama'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.continuumbooks.com/books/detail.aspx?BookId=132050 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-10-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120406132940/http://www.continuumbooks.com/books/detail.aspx?BookId=132050 |archivedate=6 April 2012 |df=dmy-all }}"&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2012 her second edition of 'With Drama in Mind' was published by Continuum/Bloomsbury and in October 2012 her book, 'Inspiring Writing Through Drama' (co-written with Rob John), was also published by Bloomsbury. 

Patrice Baldwin created 'Drama for Learning and Creativity' (D4LC), a national school improvement initiative that was piloted in Norfolk in 2005 and was supported by the [[Qualifications and Curriculum Authority]], [[Creative Partnerships]] and the [[National Endowment for Science, Technology and the Arts]] as well as [[Norfolk County Council]]. D4LC later became an IDEA project and spread internationally. She presented it at UNESCO's 2nd International Arts Education Conferences in South Korea and also, in Taiwan and Newcastle at World Creativity Summits.   D4LC is an initiative that links visiting drama specialists with pairs of non-specialist drama teachers in schools. Together they work in partnership to use drama as a way of learning and teaching. They evaluate and share the impact. More than 280 schools in Norfolk became 'D4LC schools' from 2005 – 2010 and other parts of the UK (Newport in Wales and Dorset) have also set up D4LC based initiatives. D4LC was also started in Iceland under the name, 'FLISS'  and has also proved successful with UK museum educators who want to extend the use of drama for learning in museums.

Patrice is a well established national and international drama workshop leader and conference keynote speaker on drama, education, arts and Creativity.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.alite.co.uk/newsletters/2004/february.htm&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2011 she became freelance, in order to focus more freely on her international work. Patrice has presented at Conferences in Greece, Turkey, Iceland, Germany, Austria, Poland, Hong Kong, Taiwan, South Korea, Australia, the Philippines, France, Norway, Sweden, Finland, New Zealand, Singapore, US and Canada, Argentina and Uruguay.  She was a speaker at the 2008 and 2009 World Creativity Summits in Taiwan and Newcastle and keynote speaker at Drama Australia's 2011 Conference in Perth. She presented in June 2011 at the first Drama in Education Conference in Singapore and in 2012/13 at many Conferences, including in New Hampshire (January 2012), New Zealand (April 2012), Turkey (May and November 2012), France (May 2012), Iceland (August 2012), Canada (October 2012), Greece (November 2012), Sweden (January and May 2013), Hong Kong and Singapore (February 2013), Australia (March 2013) and France (July 2013).  During 2013 she became the Cultural Leader in Theatre and Performing Arts, for Brock University, Canada.  

In 2009 she was a member of Sir Jim Rose's Editorial Expert group drafting a new primary National Curriculum for England. This curriculum did not get through Parliament before the June 2010 General Election.  She is now working in partnership with specialist drama teaching schools in the UK, as well as doing some visiting fellow work at various Universities and working as an Artsmark Trainer and validator for Arts Council England.

Patrice has also set up a CPD service for Norfolk schools and provides courses for a range of curriculum areas. See her website for more details. www.patricebaldwin.com

Salinas de Gortari was included in a list of the "10 most corrupt Mexicans" published by ''[[Forbes]]'' in 2013.&lt;ref name=Forbes&gt;{{cite web|title=The 10 Most Corrupt Mexicans Of 2013|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/doliaestevez/2013/12/16/the-10-most-corrupt-mexicans-of-2013/#2715e4857a0b798dfe167a8c|publisher=Forbes|accessdate=16 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arrest and imprisonment==
In February 1995, Raúl Salinas was arrested and charged with masterminding the murder of [[José Francisco Ruiz Massieu]], the deputy leader of the [[Institutional Revolutionary Party|PRI]] ruling party. Salinas was the former brother-in-law of Ruiz Massieu, who had been married to Raúl's sister Adriana.&lt;ref&gt;Salinas' Brother Charged in Mexican Assassination ''New York Times'' March 1, 1995 [https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/01/world/salinas-s-brother-charged-in-mexican-assassination.html]&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1999, Salinas was found guilty and sentenced to 50 years in prison (later reduced to 27.5 years).&lt;ref&gt;Raul Salinas Guilty in Killing And Is Sentenced to 50 Years ''New York Times'' January 22, 1999 [https://www.nytimes.com/1999/01/22/world/raul-salinas-guilty-in-killing-and-is-sentenced-to-50-years.html?ref=topics]&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2005, Salinas had his conviction overturned by a judicial panel and he was released from prison.&lt;ref&gt;Mexico Voids Conviction of Ex-President's Brother ''Los Angeles Times'' June 10, 2005 [http://articles.latimes.com/2005/jun/10/world/fg-salinas10]&lt;/ref&gt;

President Carlos Salinas appointed Deputy Attorney General [[:es:Mario Ruiz Massieu|Mario Ruiz Massieu]], the brother of the assassinated man, to head the investigation of the murder.  However, after a few months he resigned, claiming senior PRI officials were blocking the investigation. Later, Ruiz Massieu fled the country, but was arrested in Newark, New Jersey on money-laundering charges. He died in September 1999, apparently by suicide.&lt;ref&gt; Mario Ruiz Massieu; As victim or perpetrator, he sank in a mire of murder, bribery and drug trafficking
''The Guardian'' September 1999 [https://www.theguardian.com/news/1999/sep/20/guardianobituaries1]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alleged money laundering==

In November 1995, Raúl Salinas's wife, [[Paulina Castañón]], and his brother-in-law, [[Antonio Castañón]], were arrested in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]] after attempting to withdraw $84 million USD from an account owned by Raúl under an alias. Their capture led to the unveiling of a vast fortune spread around the world and summing to hundreds of millions of dollars even though he never officially received an annual income of more than $190,000. A report by the US [[General Accounting Office]] indicated that Raúl Salinas transferred over $90 million out of Mexico and into private bank accounts in London and Switzerland, through a complex set of transactions between 1992 and 1994, all with the help of [[Citibank]] and its affiliates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gao.gov/archive/1999/os99001.pdf |title=PRIVATE BANKING: Raul Salinas, Citibank, and Alleged Money Laundering |author=United States General Accounting Office |authorlink=Government Accountability Office |date=October 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, the government of Switzerland turned over $74 million out of the $110 million in frozen bank accounts held by Raúl Salinas, to the government of Mexico. The Swiss Justice Ministry indicated that the Mexican government had demonstrated that $66 million of the funds had been misappropriated, and the funds, with interest, were returned to Mexico. The bank accounts were held at [[Pictet &amp; Cie]], Citibank Zurich, [[Julius Baer]] Bank, and [[Banque privée Edmond de Rothschild]] in Geneva and Zurich.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/mexico/news/reformaprison.html |title=He put his trust in Switzerland and Citibank |last=Rodriguez Reyna |first=Ignacio |work=[[Frontline (U.S. TV series)|Frontline]] |publisher=[[PBS]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jordan1999"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jordan, David C.|title=Drug Politics: Dirty Money and Democracies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WK2HvMBKj4MC|year=1999|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|isbn=978-0-8061-3174-0 |page=113}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.amleurope.org/materials/reference_Materials/Switzerlands%2012-Year%20Probe%20of%20Salinas%20Wnds%20with%20$74%20Million%20Payment%20to.pdf |title=Switzerland's 12-Year Probe of Salinas Ends with $74 Million Payment |publisher=[[Association of Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialists]]}}{{dead link|date=February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other funds were returned to third parties, including Mexican billionaire [[Carlos Peralta Quintero]], who had given the funds to Raúl Salinas to set up an investment company. The Salinas family would not receive back any of the frozen funds.&lt;ref name="swissinfo" /&gt;  However, in July 2013 a court exonerated Salinas of "unjust enrichment" and ordered that 224 million pesos (approximately $18 million) and 41 properties be returned to him.  The court said that it could not explain how Salinas accumulated such wealth, but said that "so long as it is not shown that the assets acquired by public employee Raul Salinas de Gortari are proceeds derived from an abuse of his position," that he cannot be convicted of "unjust enrichment."&lt;ref&gt;Symbol of impunity: Raúl Salinas the "Inconvenient Relative" of President Carlos Salinas ''Borderline Beat'' August 5, 2013 [http://www.borderlandbeat.com/2013/08/symbol-of-impunity-raul-salinas.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 6, 2004, [[Enrique Salinas]] de Gortari, the brother of Raúl Salinas de Gortari, was found dead in his car after apparently having been beaten and strangled. Prosecutors said that Enrique Salinas had been sought for questioning by French police regarding his financial transactions with Raúl Salinas. However, investigators indicated that they thought the killing was a botched extortion attempt on him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Salinas Killing Deepens the Family's Drama |first=James C., Jr. |last=McKinley |authorlink=James C.

:''For the similarly named television station that formerly aired in Canada, see [[The Score Television Network]].''

'''SCORE''' was the weekend sports service of the [[Financial News Network]] which aired sports-themed programming starting in 1985. It was renamed FNN Sports in 1990 when FNN decided to go with a 24-hour feed on weekdays. SCORE was forced to dissolve after [[CNBC]] bought out FNN in 1991.

SCORE used a sports ticker or crawl to update scores at the bottom of the screen. As it was a co-venture with FNN, a stock ticker was often shown across the bottom of the screen. SCORE provided scores and highlight updates every half-hour.

==Programming==
SCORE had several shows that were televised versions of what [[sports talk]] radio is today.  SCORE featured some professional sporting events, live call-in shows, and sports news shows.  Live sporting events included [[professional wrestling]], [[Major Soccer League|MISL]] [[soccer]], [[college basketball]], the [[Canadian Football League|CFL]] and [[boxing]].  It also broadcast a couple [[NASCAR]] races in [[1988 in NASCAR|1988]] that were originally slated for [[Special Events Television Network|SETN]] before it folded.

It also showed at least two games of the 1986 [[National Invitation Tournament]].

===Call-in shows, including Time Out for Trivia===
Its most popular show was ''Time Out for Trivia'', hosted by [[Todd Donoho]] and produced by Eric Corwin. ''Time Out For Trivia'' was the first national live interactive game show in which viewers phoned in and if they correctly answered a question, they'd win a prize. One of the most popular prizes on the show was the [[Dirt Devil]] [[vacuum cleaner]] which often included a funny sound effect like an "ooooh" or an "oooooh.... aaaaaah." Humor was almost always an ingredient, particularly in the multiple-choice questions, which often included an obvious nonsports figure as one of the possible answers. 

''Time Out For Trivia'' became a cult hit on cable TV, receiving many glowing reviews in newspapers and magazines. Gary Nuhn, a columnist for the ''[[Dayton Daily News]]'', has called TOFT "cable TV at its best," and Wendell Barnhouse, radio/TV columnist for the ''[[Star-Telegram|Fort Worth Star-Telegram]]'', says it is "one of life's joys." ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' did a feature about ''TOFT'' in its famous swimsuit issue.[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1067034/index.htm] Donoho and Corwin did over 1,000 shows together, including a 1,000th show "special edition", a one-hour program which featured highlights from the first 999 shows. Donoho and Corwin worked together on ''TOFT'' and other shows at FNN/SCORE from 1985 through 1989 before joining the sports department at [[KABC-TV|KABC]].  Much of this show was incorporated into a show on KABC called ''Monday Night Live'', which aired after ''[[Monday Night Football]]'' from {{nfly|1990}} to {{nfly|1999}}, when Donoho's contract was not renewed by KABC.  The show was then renamed ''Sports Zone'' with host Rob Fukuzaki and it remained an ''MNF'' postgame show until the package left ABC after the 2005 season.  ''Sports Zone'' remains on KABC, following many events televised by the network.

Other call-in shows included ''The Fan Speaks Out'', ''The Final Score'', and ''The Sports Collector''.

===News programs===
News shows featured included ''Tennis Talk'', a baseball program called ''The Hot Stove League'', and a sports wagering program with [[Wayne Root]]. Other hosts included [[Bill Brown (broadcaster)|Bill Brown]], [[Byron Day]], John Loesing, Hugh Malay and Fred Wallin. Many of the shows were directed by Brad Toberman. Show producers included Jim Battey, Michael Pierce, Steven Herbert, Gary Kubik, Hugh Malay, Eric Corwin and Steven Friedman.

===Professional wrestling===
The professional wrestling programming exposed fans throughout the country to regional territory wrestling promotions. These territories included the [[Jim Crockett Promotions|Mid-Atlantic]] with [[Ric Flair]] and Chief [[Wahoo McDaniel]], [[Continental Wrestling Federation|Memphis]] with [[Jerry Lawler|Jerry 'the King' Lawler]], [[World Class Championship Wrestling|Texas]] with the Von Erichs and the Maivia family's [[Hawaii]] promotion with [[Rocky Johnson]], [[King Curtis]], [[Don Muraco]], [[Lawrence Heinemi|Lars Anderson]], [[Superfly Snuka]], [[Bruiser Brody]] and many [[Japan]]ese wrestlers.  It also prominently featured wrestling from the [[Continental Championship Wrestling|Continental Wrestling Federation]] including matches featuring [[Eddie Gilbert (wrestler)|Eddie Gilbert]], [[Tom Prichard]], and [[Tony Anthony (wrestler) | The Dirty White Boy]].

'''''Shark Tank''''' is an American [[Reality television#Investments|reality television series]] that premiered on August 9, 2009, on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]].&lt;ref name="Insider TV"&gt;Hibberd, James (May 10, 2012)[http://insidetv.ew.com/2012/05/10/abc-dancing-with-the-stars-shark-tank/ 'Dancing,' 'Bachelor,' and a bigger 'Shark Tank' returning to ABC] Insider TV. Retrieved June 24, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The show is a franchise of the international format ''[[Dragons' Den]]'', which originated in Japan in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/shark-tank-international-versions-2013-11|title=Here's What 'Shark Tank' Looks Like In 9 Different Countries|work=Business Insider|access-date=2018-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Shark Tank'' shows aspiring [[entrepreneurship|entrepreneurs]] as they make business presentations to a panel of five "shark" [[investor]]s, who then choose whether to invest as business partners.

==Overview==
''Shark Tank'' is produced by [[Mark Burnett]] and based on the format ''[[Dragons' Den]]'', which originated in 2001 with the Japanese show ''Tigers of Money''.&lt;ref name=Variety&gt;Adalian, Josef (February 13, 2008). [http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117980906.html?categoryid=14&amp;cs=1 "Sony, Burnett dive into 'Shark Tank'"]. ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', "a version of the Japanese reality format."&lt;/ref&gt; ''Shark Tank,'' however, more closely resembles the format of the [[Dragons' Den (UK TV series)|British version]] of ''Dragons' Den'', which premiered in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dehnart|first=Andy|title='Shark Tank's’ Sneak Attack!|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/05/11/shark-tank-s-sneak-attack.html|work=The Daily Beast|accessdate=October 11, 2013|date=May 11, 2012|quote="Based on ''Dragon's Den'', the U.K. version of a Japanese format, Shark Tank gives people..."}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, W.

However, if all of the panel members opt out, the entrepreneur leaves empty-handed.&lt;ref name="Wash Po 2009"/&gt; The show is said to portray "the drama of pitch meetings and the interaction between the entrepreneurs and tycoons."&lt;ref name="Biz Insider"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://au.businessinsider.com/abc-to-humiliate-struggling-entrepreneurs-on-national-television-2009-3 | title=ABC To Humiliate Entrepreneurs on National TV | publisher=Business Insider (Australia) | date=March 31, 2009 | accessdate=March 21, 2013 | author=Lewis, Hilary | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130410162807/http://au.businessinsider.com/abc-to-humiliate-struggling-entrepreneurs-on-national-television-2009-3 | archivedate=April 10, 2013 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; A one-hour pitch by a contestant is edited down to "a dramatic 10-minute segment."&lt;ref name="Biz Insider 2"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://au.businessinsider.com/23-year-old-turns-down-big-money-from-mark-cuban-2012-9 | title=23-Year-Old Turns Down Big Money From Mark Cuban | publisher=Business Insider (Australia) | date=September 22, 2012 | accessdate=March 21, 2013 | author=Shontell, Allyson | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130926144858/http://www.businessinsider.com.au/23-year-old-turns-down-big-money-from-mark-Cuban-2012-9 | archivedate=September 26, 2013 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two of the show's longstanding "sharks," [[Robert Herjavec]] and [[Kevin O'Leary]], are Canadian entrepreneurs who had previously appeared on the [[Dragons' Den (Canadian TV series)|Canadian version]] of ''Dragons' Den''.

The "sharks" often find weaknesses and faults in an entrepreneur's concept, product, or business model.&lt;ref name="Wash Po 2009"/&gt; Some of the investors try to soften the impact of rejection, like panel member Corcoran, while others such as O'Leary can be "brutal" and show "no patience even for tales of hardship".&lt;ref name="Wash Po 2009"/&gt;

The show initially required each contestant to sign an agreement with Finnmax, the producer of ''Shark Tank'', promising Finnmax the option of taking a "2 percent royalty" or "5% equity stake" in the contestant's business venture.&lt;ref name="NY Times 2012"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://boss.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/09/19/passing-up-the-opportunity-to-appear-on-shark-tank/ | title=Passing Up the Opportunity to Appear on 'Shark Tank' | work=The New York Times | date=September 19, 2012 | accessdate=March 21, 2013 | author=Kassar, Ami}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in October 2013, this requirement was repealed by the network, retroactively, due to pressure from panel member [[Mark Cuban]].&lt;ref name="Inc.

==Reception==
===Critical reception===
During its first season, ''Shark Tank'' saw a mostly positive reception. Josh Wolk of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' wrote, "The moneymen ask informed questions and make shrewd decisions, a welcome relief from [[Donald Trump]]'s capricious calls on Burnett's ''[[Celebrity Apprentice]]''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/tv/shark-tank|title=Shark Tank|publisher=Metacritic|accessdate=August 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heather Havrilesky from [[Salon (website)|Salon]] said that "ABC's ''Shark Tank'' is easily the best new reality TV show to air this summer."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/2009/08/02/sharks_2/|title=Who wants to be a billionaire?|author=Heather Havrilesky|work=Salon|accessdate=August 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tom Shales of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' wrote, "It sounds gimmicky and visually tedious, with most of the so-called action taking place in a conference room. It's all those things, but the moments of misery make it memorable."&lt;ref name="Wash Po 2009" /&gt; Shales noted that the series was premiering during an economic recession, and that many of the aspiring entrepreneurs had poured significant amounts of money into their businesses; he praised "how deftly the show personalizes the desperation and pain experienced by victims of a broken down economy."&lt;ref name="Wash Po 2009"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://articles.washingtonpost.com/2009-08-08/opinions/36927095_1_contestants-new-reality-show-judges | title=Shark Tank: ABC Is Out For Blood | work=The Washington Post | date=August 8, 2009 | accessdate=March 21, 2013 | author=Shales, Tom | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921054637/http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2009-08-08/opinions/36927095_1_contestants-new-reality-show-judges | archivedate=September 21, 2013 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; And David Hinckley of the ''[[New York Daily News]]'' said, "Once you get past its somewhat misleading title, Mark Burnett's new Shark Tank is a well-paced hour that offers entertainment without humiliation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv-movies/mark-burnett-shark-tank-abc-entertains-humiliating-capitalists-fish-financing-article-1.397721|title=Capitalists fish for financing on Mark Burnett's 'Shark Tank'|work=Daily News|location=New York|accessdate=October 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ratings===
During the first two seasons, the series barely peaked at 5 million viewers, with season 2 only having 9 episodes in its run. But by season 3, the show's viewership went past 5 million and started to crack the top 100 in the ratings. By 2012, the show averaged over 6 million viewers per episode. It is the most watched program on Friday nights in the 18- to 49-year-old demographic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/shark-tank-grimm-chuck-tv-ratings-283774|title=TV Ratings: 'Shark Tank' Boosts ABC, 'Grimm' Jumps Double Digits|work=The Hollywood Reporter|access-date=2018-11-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{CN|date=April 2017}} As a result, ABC added three more episodes to the original season order of 22.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4086">The federal Small Business Health Options Program is an insurance exchange, created by [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] (Obamacare). &lt;ref&gt;http://www.bozemandailychronicle.com/news/health/popular-small-business-health-care-program-may-change-expand/article_dddc4ed4-79bd-11e4-a046-9fa09e151950.html&lt;/ref&gt; The Small Business Health Options Program (SHOP) Marketplace helps small businesses to provide health coverage to their employees. Therefore, it is open to employers with 50 or fewer full-time equivalent employees (FTEs), in which it also includes non-profit organizations. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.healthcare.gov/small-businesses/provide-shop-coverage/shop-marketplace-overview/&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[HealthCare.gov]], the benefit of SHOP Marketplace includes, allowing owner to offer health and dental coverage to employees. Other than that, with flexibility, choice, and the online application and account management, SHOP aims to meets the needs of the business owner and its employees. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.healthcare.gov/small-businesses/provide-shop-coverage/shop-marketplace-overview/&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 Employee Choice was introduced under of the PPACA's Small Business Health Options Program (SHOP) Marketplace.  While SHOP was available for 2014, this is the first year that small employers in 14 states can apply online. Before 2015 employers who provided health insurance to their employees typically worked with an  [[insurance broker]] and one [[health insurance company]]. In 2015, they however can offer their employees a choice of insurance companies.

SHOP enrollment is available  any time of the year - there is no "Open Enrollment" limitation.  Employers who wish to contribute to the premium cost of their employees may qualify to receive a [[SHOP tax credit]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.biztimes.com/article/20141208/MAGAZINE03/312059981/-1/MAGAZINE&lt;/ref&gt; The tax credit is worth up to 50% of employer's contribution toward its employees' premium costs. It will be up to 35% for tax-exempt employers. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.healthcare.gov/small-businesses/provide-shop-coverage/small-business-tax-credits/&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately, employees can't join the plan after the initial enrollment period unless they are new hires and qualify Special Enrollment Period.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.healthcare.gov/small-businesses/provide-shop-coverage/shop-marketplace-overview/&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[HealthCare.gov]], special Enrollment Period refers to a time outside of the open enrollment period, in which you and your family have a right to sign up for health coverage. In other words, you qualify for a special enrollment period 60 days following certain life events, including but limited to: change in family status such as marriage or birth of a child, loss of other health coverage. 


However, SHOP Marketplace is not offered to self-employed individuals, with no employees. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.healthcare.gov/small-businesses/provide-shop-coverage/shop-marketplace-overview/&lt;/ref&gt; They can however get health coverage through [[Health Insurance Marketplace]] for individuals. 

As of March 13, 2015, the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services]] claims, evidence has shown that the SHOP marketplace is working in terms of affordability. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.hhs.gov/healthcare/facts/factsheets/2014/10/affordable-care-act-is-working.html&lt;/ref&gt; For taxpayers, they are benefiting as the health costs and spending have decreased last year. &lt;ref&gt;content&lt;/ref&gt; With a historic slow down in the growth of [[health care prices in the United States|health care costs]], workers, business and taxpayers are able to generate savings under the introduction of SHOP. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.hhs.gov/healthcare/facts/factsheets/2014/10/affordable-care-act-is-working.html&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3037">A '''student managed investment fund''' is a pool of [[money]] which [[business student]]s [[Investment|invest]] as a learning experience.  As of 2008, more than 200 [[universities]] have student-run [[Funding|fund]]s, which vary in size from several hundred thousand dollars to millions of dollars.&lt;ref&gt;Trejos, Nancy, "U-Md. Students Bring their Real-Money Fund Home to a Surprising Finish, " Washington Post 2008-05-11 Page F1 https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/05/10/AR2008051000197.html?hpid=sec-business&lt;/ref&gt;

The funds to be managed come from various sources, such as gifts from private individuals and corporations, gifts from foundations, and from university endowment or foundation assets. Some student managed [[investment fund]]s such as the [[University of Texas at Austin]] manage funds for private clients, who are [[accredited investor]]s under U.S. securities laws. Another special case is the [[loan]] that proves the funds at [[Cameron University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Neely|first1=Walter P.|last2=Cooley|first2=Philip L.|title=A Survey of Student Managed Funds|publisher=ResearchGate|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228594658_A_Survey_of_Student_Managed_Funds|date=2003|accessdate=June 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some student managed investment funds are organized by function (accounting, public relations, etc.), while others such as the [[Lemma Senbet Fund]] are organized by economic sectors ([[Consumer Products]], [[Energy Industry]], [[Information technology]], etc.).

The business students managing the fund typically take a for-credit course in conjunction with their management duties.  Many of these programs belong to the Association of Student Managed Investment Programs.

In addition to managing a [[Portfolio (finance)|portfolio]], these classes provide related experiences relevant to being a professional [[Asset management|fund manager]].  For example, the CFA Society of Orange County Foundation (CFAOCF) conducts an annual request for proposals competition which allows student teams from local universities to experience first-hand the process that fund managers must go through in order to be allowed to [[Investment management|manage institutional fund]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csulb.edu/~smif/SMIF_Home/SMIF_Funding.html|title=CSULB SMIF Funding|accessdate=2009-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Swissmem''' is the '''Swiss association of mechanical and electrical engineering industries''' (MEM industries). With some 320,000 employees, the MEM industries are Switzerland’s largest industrial employer and,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swissmem.ch/en/industry-politics/about-the-industry.html "About the Industry"] Retrieved 2016-02-29.&lt;/ref&gt; since they account for 31 percent of the country’s exports, an important economic and political player. In 2015, the nearly 1,000 member companies of Swissmem exported goods worth 63 billion [[Swiss francs]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swissmem.ch/en/industry-politics/about-the-industry.html "About the Industry"] Retrieved 2016-02-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

Swissmem was created by the merger of two associations: ASM (Association of Swiss Engineering Employers) und VSM (Swiss Association of Machinery Manufacturers). Both associations have been operating under the Swissmem name since 1999. VSM was renamed Swissmem at the beginning of 2007, when it took over all ASM’s activities with the exception of those associated with the sector’s collective bargaining agreement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swissmem.ch/en/the-association/portrait/historical-background.html "Historical Background"]. Retrieved 2010-12-20.&lt;/ref&gt;

Swissmem represents the MEM industries’ interests to the Swiss government, national and international organizations, employee representative bodies and the public. It also acts as the MEM industries’ service centre. In its capacity as employer representative, Swissmem negotiates the terms of the collective bargaining agreement for the MEM industries with the unions. The MEM industries’ collective bargaining agreement is traditionally a benchmark for a large number of collective bargaining agreements in Switzerland, having evolved to its current state of refinement since the "peace agreement" of 1937.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sozialpartner.ch/index-e.htm "Agreement in the Mechanical and Electrical Engineering Industry"] Retrieved 2010-12-20.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Organization ==
Swissmem is chaired by Hans Hess since November 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swissmem.ch/en/information-policy/media/media-communications/single-view/news/hans-hess-ist-neuer-swissmem-praesident/145.html "Hans Hess becomes new Swissmem President"]. Retrieved 2010-12-20.&lt;/ref&gt; Federal Councillor Johann Niklaus Schneider-Ammann was formerly the President of Swissmem.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swissmem.ch/en/information-policy/media/media-communications/single-view/news/grosse-freude-ueber-die-wahl-von-johann-n-schneider-ammann/145.html "Delight at the election of Johann N. Schneider-Ammann"] Retrieved 2010-12-20.&lt;/ref&gt; In the past, several important officials of Swissmem, ASM or VSM have risen to even more influential positions in the Swiss Employers’ Association (Peter Hasler, Thomas Daum (Switzerland).

Swissmem’s CEO is Peter Dietrich.

== Member companies ==
Swissmem has nearly 1,000 member companies, including all Switzerland’s major industrial enterprises.
Swissmem’s members are divided into the following specialist groups:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swissmem.ch/en/organization-members/specialist-groups.html "Specialist Groups"] Retrieved 2014-02-12&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Cleveland Mall''' is a long public [[park]] in [[downtown Cleveland|downtown]] [[Cleveland, Ohio]].  It was conceived as part of the 1903 '''Group Plan''' by [[Daniel Burnham]], [[John Merven Carrère|John Carrère]], and [[Arnold Brunner]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.library.cornell.edu/Reps/DOCS/brunner.htm |title=Cleveland's Group Plan |first=Arnold W. |last=Brunner |authorlink=Arnold W. Brunner |work=Cornell University |date=June 1916}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a vast public space flanked by the city's major civic and governmental buildings, all built in the [[neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] style. Many of those buildings were built over the following three decades, including the [[Howard M. Metzenbaum United States Courthouse|Metzenbaum Courthouse]] (1910), [[Cuyahoga County Courthouse]] (1912), [[Cleveland City Hall]] (1916), [[Public Auditorium]] (1922), the [[Cleveland Public Library]] main building (1925), and the [[Cleveland Public Schools]] [[Board of Education]] building (1931).&lt;ref name=PD&gt;{{cite news |title=Public art warps reality on Cleveland mall |newspaper=[[The Plain Dealer]] |date=October 1, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other buildings include [[Key Tower]], the [[Global Center for Health Innovation]], the [[Hilton Cleveland Downtown Hotel]], and the [[Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland]].

In the spirit of the [[City Beautiful movement]], formerly seedy areas were transformed into a "magnificent [[Civic Center (Cleveland)|civic center]]", which was supposed to be crowned by the [[Cleveland Union Terminal|Union Terminal]] at the north end of the mall, on the shores of [[Lake Erie]].  However, the location of the station was eventually moved south and west, to [[Public Square, Cleveland|Public Square]], where it was finally born as the [[Terminal Tower]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Leedy |first=Walter C., Jr. |url=http://web.ulib.csuohio.edu/SpecColl/gamut/1983w/ctt/gamut2.html |title=Cleveland's Terminal Tower—The Van Sweringens' Afterthought |accessdate=9 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though the plan was never fully carried out, it was one of the few City Beautiful plans to be realized to a large extent, and remains one of the most complete examples in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lawrence |first=Michael G. |title=Make No Little Plans |publisher=[[Western Reserve Historical Society]] |year=1980 |isbn=978-0-911704-24-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Mall was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1975.&lt;ref name = nris/&gt;

The Mall is divided into three sections, known as Malls A, B, and C. Mall A, the southernmost, is officially named Veterans' Memorial Plaza,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.clevelandvetsmemorial.org/GCVM_History.html |title=GCVM History and Mission |work=Greater Cleveland Veterans Memorial |accessdate=9 May 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090216170723/http://www.clevelandvetsmemorial.org/GCVM_History.html |archivedate=16 February 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Mall C was dedicated as Strawbridge Plaza in 2003.  The Memorial Plaza, between Rockwell and St. Clair Avenues, is the site of the [[Fountain of Eternal Life]], also known as the War Memorial Fountain.  The [[Cleveland Convention Center (demolished)|Cleveland Convention Center]] was built underneath Malls B and C in 1964.  In 2010 the county purchased the underground convention center from the city as part of a project to completely rebuild it in conjunction with constructing the Global Center for Health Innovation and the Hilton Cleveland Downtown Hotel on the former site of the [[Cuyahoga County, Ohio|Cuyahoga County]] Administration Building across from Mall B.  The new [[Huntington Convention Center of Cleveland]] opened in 2013 and has underground connections to [[Public Hall|Public Auditorium]] and the [[Global Center for Health Innovation]]. The Hilton officially opened in June 2016.  Mall B and Mall C reopened after construction as predominantly grassy areas, with Mall B reaching 27 feet above sidewalk level over the entrance to the Cleveland Convention Center along Lakeside Avenue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Steven |last=Litt |url=http://www.cleveland.com/architecture/index.ssf/2013/06/clevelands_new_convention_cent.html |title=Cleveland's new Convention Center and Global Center for Health Innovation aren't stand-alone icons, and that's a good thing |newspaper=[[The Plain Dealer]] |date=2013-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cleveland Public Art has sponsored a series of temporary [[public art]] installations on Mall B. In 2004, [[New York City|New York]] artist [[Brian Tolle]] installed ''For the gentle wind doth move Silently, invisibly''. The work featured eight nine-foot-tall [[styrofoam]] neoclassical [[urn]]s standing atop pedestals, warped to reflect actual wind data collected from Lake Erie.&lt;ref name=PD /&gt; The sculptures were taken down in 2006. In May 2008, Peter North and Alissa North of North Design Office in [[Toronto]] installed a work titled ''The Verdant Walk''. It features plantings of native [[grass]]es and seven fabric-covered sculptures. The sculptures are illuminated at night via a [[solar energy|solar-powered]] [[Light-emitting diode|LED]] system. They will remain in place until 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=David |last=Beach|url=http://www.gcbl.org/blog/david-beach/art-environment-technology-on-the-mall |title=Art, environment, technology on the Mall |accessdate=2008-06-29 |publisher=GreenCityBlueLake |date=2008-06-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Thomas Kavaningilamo 'Tom' Alweendo''' (born 17 March 1958 in Omusheshe, [[Oshana Region]]) is a [[Namibia]]n businessperson and politician who has been Minister of Mines and Energy since 2018. In 2003, he became the first Namibian [[Governor of the Bank of Namibia]] when he replaced [[Jafaar bin Ahmad]] of [[Malaysia]]. From the mid-1990s until 2001, he was head of [[Air Namibia]].

Alweendo earned a bachelor's degree from the [[University of the Witwatersrand]] in [[South Africa]] and a [[Master of Business Administration]] from the [[University of Wales]] in the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title= Alweendo, Thomas K. | publisher = [[Parliament of Namibia]] | accessdate=9 March 2018  | url=http://www.parliament.na/index.php?option=com_contact&amp;view=contact&amp;id=964:alweendo-tom-a&amp;catid=104&amp;Itemid=1479}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Governor of the Bank of Namibia, he maintained the [[Namibian dollar]]'s linkage with the [[South African rand]]. He also raised concerns about increasing amounts of government debt and questioned whether expenditures on education produced better results.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nid.org.na/view_book_entry.php?book_id=14 Tom Alweendo] Namibia Institute for Democracy  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110611171207/http://www.nid.org.na/view_book_entry.php?book_id=14 |date=June 11, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 Alweendo was appointed to lead the National Planning Commission. When [[Hage Geingob]] took office as President in March 2015, he confirmed him in this post, now named Minister in the Presidency in charge of the National Planning Commission.&lt;ref name=Costly&gt;{{cite news | title=Costly Democracy | last1=Immanuel | first1=Shinovene | last2=Mongudhi | first2=Tileni | newspaper=[[The Namibian]] | date=20 March 2015 | pages=1–2 | url=http://www.namibian.com.na/indexx.php?id=24690}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a Cabinet reshuffle in February 2018, Alweendo became Minister of Mines and Energy, swapping positions with [[Obeth Kandjoze]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title=President reshuffles Cabinet—Vice President relieved of duties | last=Matthys | first=Donald | newspaper=[[Namibia Economist]] | date=8 February 2018 | url=https://economist.com.na/32603/general-news/president-reshuffles-cabinet-vice-president-relieved-of-duties/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Trailer tracking''' is tracking the position of an [[Semi-trailer truck|articulated vehicle]]’s [[Semi-trailer|trailer]] unit through a tracking device fitted to the trailer.&lt;ref Name="Donath"&gt;{{cite book

==Trailer Tracking System==
Trailer tracking systems can provide essential information to trailer operators on; status, location, door activity and history. These systems utilize the information to provide reliable and protected services to shippers of perishable commodities.

Trailer Tracking is also a trucking term in which, when a Semi turns a corner the trailer tires will be closer to the curb (even jump the curb if semi turns to sharp) than the truck cab will be.

Trailer tracking systems require 4 essential components to operate.

# Communication Network
# Back-end Server and Database
# User Interface Software

He used the title of "Chief Technology Officer" in this role and later admitted that this title exaggerated his actual responsibilities.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;!-- Relevant quote: 私は、国会東京電力福島原子力発電所事故調査委員会にて、委員会で利用するPC等のインフラ構築、保守管理等の業務に携わっていました。そこでの私の立場は、調査そのものにはタッチしない、一般企業でいうところのいわゆる「システム部門」の担当者でした。その際、肩書をどのようにするべきか問われたため、「最高技術責任者（CTO：Chief Technology Officer）」を提案したところ、問題なく了承され、事務方から名刺をいただきました。 --&gt;

Saito was at one time a top advisor to Prime Minister [[Shinzō Abe|Shinzo Abe]] on cybersecurity issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/japanrealtime/2015/07/01/top-abe-cybersecurity-adviser-says-japan-could-be-global-leader-in-field/|title=Top Abe Cybersecurity Adviser Says Japan Could Be Global Leader in Field|last=Mochizuki|first=Takashi|date=2015-07-01|website=WSJ|language=en-US|access-date=2018-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was formally a cybersecurity advisor to the [[Cabinet Office (Japan)|Cabinet Office]] from 2013 to 2017, and an advisor to the [[Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry]] from 2016 to 2017.&lt;ref name=JapanTimes2017/&gt; He also served as a member of the technical task force for the [[2020 Summer Olympics]] and [[2020 Summer Paralympics|Paralympics]], and as an advisor on education policy to the [[Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology]].&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nikkan-gendai.com/articles/view/news/220162|title=経歴詐称の斎藤ウィリアム浩幸氏 なぜ自民党は重用したか|last=|first=|date=2017-12-24|website=Nikkan Gendai|language=ja|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saito accompanied Abe on a 2015 visit to [[Silicon Valley]], where Abe met with the heads of several major technology firms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/r-abe-seeking-new-spark-for-japan-high-tech-heads-to-silicon-valley-2015-4|title=Shinzo Abe wants to bring Silicon Valley to Japan|last=Layne|first=Nathan|date=2015-04-30|work=Business Insider|access-date=2018-01-29|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|agency=Reuters|last2=Wilson|first2=Thomas|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the private sector, Saito was appointed as a strategic advisor to [[Japan Airlines]] in 2015, and provided advice to JAL on its IT strategy. He served as a part-time Executive Officer and as the first General Manager of Digital Innovation Promotion at JAL from May to December 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nikkei.com/article/DGXMZO17061060Q7A530C1000000/|title=JALが「デジタルイノベーション部」、起業家を招へい|last=金子寛人|first=|date=2017-05-30|work=[[The Nikkei]]|access-date=2018-01-25|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=ja-JP|quote=2015年4月からJALの戦略アドバイザーを務めており、IT関連の施策についてアドバイスをしていた。今回非常勤の執行役員として、より具体的にJALのIT活用に携わる。}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://press.jal.co.jp/en/items/uploads/22DEC%20Press%20Memo.pdf|title=JAL Announce Changes to Executive Officers/Assignment|last=|first=|date=2017-12-22|website=Japan Airlines|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a member of the advisory board of ''[[The Japan Times]]'' from 2014 to 2015,&lt;ref name=JapanTimes2017/&gt; and also served as an advisor to [[Hakuhodo]] and [[Fast Retailing]].&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

In December 2017 the writer [[Ichiro Yamamoto (writer)|Ichiro Yamamoto]] raised questions on his blog about Saito's claims that he graduated from UCLA's medical school and about his work experience in cybersecurity.&lt;ref name=JapanTimes2017/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=William Saito resigns as METI adviser amid questions about background |url=https://www.tokyoreporter.com/2017/12/22/william-h-saito-resigns-as-meti-adviser-amid-questions-about-background/|work=Tokyo Reporter|date=December 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Saito resigned from his Cabinet and METI advisory positions in December 2017, citing personal reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.tokyo-np.co.jp/article/economics/list/201712/CK2017122202000129.html|title=「サイバー対策専門家」　経産・内閣府参与辞任|last=|first=|date=2017-12-22|work=[[Tokyo Shimbun]]|access-date=2018-01-25|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=ja-JP}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.asahi.com/articles/ASKDQ54FVKDQUTFK013.html|title=斎藤ウィリアム浩幸氏、内閣府などの参与辞任　経歴訂正：朝日新聞デジタル|last=|first=|date=2017-12-22|work=[[Asahi Shimbun]]|access-date=2018-01-25|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=ja-JP}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same day, Japan Airlines announced that he had resigned as a digital innovations officer.&lt;ref name=TRtwitter&gt;{{cite news|title=William Saito denies NYT report on buying Twitter followers|url=https://www.tokyoreporter.com/2018/02/26/william-saito-denies-nyt-report-on-buying-twitter-followers/|work=Tokyo Reporter|date=February 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; After leaving his posts, on his website he said that he did not graduate from UCLA medical school, and clarified his role in investigating the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster.&lt;ref name=JapanTimes2017/&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://saitohome.com/ja/6280-2/|title=ブログ等におけるご指摘について|last=Saito|first=William Hiroyuki|date=2017-12-21|work=saitohome.com|access-date=2018-01-24|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=ja}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- Relevant quote from Saito's blog: このように、ITの世界に魅了され、追求する中で医師の道を中途で断念したというエピソードを披露することを繰り返すうちに、事実と異なる経歴を語ってしまったことは私の過ちでした。UCLAの医学部を卒業し、医師免許を取得したという事実はございません。 --&gt;&lt;!-- Relevant quote: しかし、国会事故調という組織の任務を考えれば、「最高技術責任者」という肩書は、原子力技術に関する高度な知見を有して調査に関与している人物であるかのような誤解を受ける可能性があると思い至るべきでした。私の実際の職務に比して、このような肩書を用いることが適切といえたか、その後もかかる経歴を示すことが適切であったかと問われると、軽率であったと反省しています。 --&gt; Following these revelations, economy minister [[Hiroshige Sekō]] stated that no falsifications had been found in the resume that Saito submitted to METI in connection with his hiring.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

In January 2018 an article in the ''[[New York Times]]'' listed Saito's twitter account as among those for which [[ghost followers]] had been purchased from Devumi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Confessore|first1=Nicholas|title=The Follower Factory|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/01/27/technology/social-media-bots.html|work=The New York Times|date=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TRtwitter/&gt; Saito denied that he had done this, and deleted his Twitter account.&lt;ref name=TRtwitter/&gt;
