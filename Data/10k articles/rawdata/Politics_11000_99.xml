The '''1973 World Congress of Peace Forces''' was held in [[Moscow]], [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russian SFSR]], [[Soviet Union]], October 25-October 31, 1973.&lt;!-- This was however, not the only such conference ever held.

[[Stockholm]]: Svenska Fredskommittén, 1974. p. 6-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

The main speaker of the event was [[Leonid Brezhnev]], general secretary of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]].

'''Alex MacFarlane''' is an [[intersex]] person born with [[Klinefelter syndrome|XXY]] sex chromosomes in [[Victoria, Australia|Victoria]], Australia. Alex MacFarlane is believed to be the first holder of an indeterminate birth certificate and passport.&lt;ref name="West Australian" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Science as Culture" /&gt;&lt;ref name="asa" /&gt;&lt;ref name="oii10" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sydney Morning Herald" /&gt;

== Birth certificate and passport ==

MacFarlane is believed to be the first person in Australia to obtain a birth certificate recording sex as indeterminate, and the first Australian passport with an 'X' sex marker in 2003.&lt;ref name="West Australian" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Science as Culture" /&gt;&lt;ref name="asa"&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.asanet.org/sectionsex/documents/SUMMER03sexnews.pdf | title = Newsletter of the Sociology of Sexualities Section of the American Sociological Association | journal = [[American Sociological Association]] Sexualities News | volume = 6 | issue = 1 | date = Summer 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="oii10"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://oii.org.au/21597/ | title = Ten years of ‘X’ passports, and no protection from discrimination | work = [[Organisation Intersex International Australia]] | date = 19 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sydney Morning Herald" /&gt; MacFarlane was reported as receiving a passport with an 'X' sex descriptor in early 2003.&lt;ref name="West Australian"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bodieslikeours.org/pdf/xmarks.pdf |title=X marks the spot for intersex Alex |work=West Australian |publisher=bodieslikeours.org |date=11 January 2003 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110023525/http://www.bodieslikeours.org/pdf/xmarks.pdf |archivedate=10 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Science as Culture"&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09505430802280784?journalCode=csac20#.Un8OUZFw1cc | first = Ingrid | last = Holme | title = Hearing People's Own Stories | journal = Science as Culture | volume = 17 | issue = 3 | doi = 10.1080/09505430802280784 | date = 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sydney Morning Herald"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/neither-man-nor-woman-20100626-zaye.html | title = Neither man nor woman | work = [[Sydney Morning Herald]] | date = 27 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This was stated by the West Australian to be on the basis of a challenge by MacFarlane, using an indeterminate birth certificate issued by the State of Victoria. The West Australian newspaper reported in January 2003 that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade "had decided to accommodate people whose birth certificates recorded their sex as indeterminate ... Alex is also believed to be the first Australian issued with a birth certificate acknowledging a gender other than male or female. Alex says "indeterminate – also known as intersex". It was issued in Alex's birth State of Victoria, which unlike WA, changed its policy to allow the category".&lt;ref name="West Australian" /&gt;

Several other Australians are known to have adopted sex non-specific or indeterminate identification documents subsequently, including [[Tony Briffa]],&lt;ref name="gnn"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://gaynewsnetwork.com.au/news/national/tony-briffa-to-wed-partner-in-nz-ceremony-12022.html | title = OII VP Tony Briffa to wed partner in NZ ceremony – Gay News Network | work = [[SX News|Gay News Network]] | date = 27 September 2013 | access-date = 6 December 2013 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131110035430/http://gaynewsnetwork.com.au/news/national/tony-briffa-to-wed-partner-in-nz-ceremony-12022.html | archive-date = 10 November 2013 | dead-url = yes | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cr Tony Briffa"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://briffa.org/about | title = About Tony | work = Briffa.org | date = 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Norrie May-Welby]].&lt;ref name="Telegraph"&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/7446850/Briton-is-recognised-as-worlds-first-officially-genderless-person.html | title = Briton is recognised as world's first officially genderless person | work = The Telegraph | date = 15 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DailyLifeAU"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.dailylife.com.au/news-and-views/dl-opinion/norrie-maywelbys-battle-to-regain-status-as-the-worlds-first-legally-genderless-person-20131107-2x3nh.html | title = Norrie May-Welby's battle to regain status as the world's first legally genderless person | work = Daily Life Australia | date = 8 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Huffington"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/03/18/norrie-may-welby-the-worl_n_502851.html | title = Norrie May-Welby: The World's First Legally Genderless Person | work = The Huffington Post | date = 18 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John Orley Allen Tate''' (November 19, 1899 &amp;ndash; February 9, 1979), known professionally as '''Allen Tate''', was an American poet, essayist, social commentator, and [[Poet Laureate Consultant in Poetry to the Library of Congress|Poet Laureate]] from 1943 to 1944.

==Life==

===Early years===
Tate was born near [[Winchester, Kentucky]], to John Orley Tate, a businessman, and Eleanor Parke Custis Varnell.  In 1916 and 1917 Tate studied the violin at the [[Cincinnati Conservatory of Music]].

===Vanderbilt University, Rhodes College, Kenyon College and The Fugitives===
He began attending [[Vanderbilt University]] in 1918, where he met fellow poet [[Robert Penn Warren]].  Warren and Tate were invited to join an informal literary group of young Southern poets under the leadership of [[John Crowe Ransom]]; the group were known as the [[Fugitives (poets)|Fugitives]]. Tate contributed to the group's magazine ''The Fugitive''. The aim of the group, according to the critic J. A. Bryant, was "to demonstrate that a group of southerners could produce important work in the medium [of poetry], devoid of sentimentality and carefully crafted," and they wrote in the formalist tradition that valued the skillful use of meter and rhyme.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.poets.org/viewmedia.php/prmMID/5655 ''A Brief Guide to the Fugitives''. Academy of American Poets website]&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[Robert Penn Warren]] left [[Rhodes College]] to accept a position at [[Louisiana State University]], he recommended Tate to replace him. Tate accepted the position, and spent 1934-36 as lecturer in English at Rhodes.

Tate also joined Ransom to teach at [[Kenyon College]] in [[Gambier, Ohio]]. Some of his notable students there included the poets [[Robert Lowell]] and [[Randall Jarrell]]. Lowell's early poetry was particularly influenced by Tate's formalist brand of Modernism.

===1920s===
In 1924, Tate moved to [[New York City]] where he met poet [[Hart Crane]], with whom he had been exchanging correspondence for some time. Over a four-year period, he worked freelance for ''[[The Nation]]'', contributed to the ''[[Hound &amp; Horn]]'', ''[[Poetry Magazine|Poetry]]'' magazine, and others. To make ends meet, he worked as a janitor. (Some years later, he would also contribute articles to the conservative ''[[National Review]]''.){{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

During a summer visit with the poet [[Robert Penn Warren]] in [[Kentucky]], he began a relationship with writer [[Caroline Gordon]]. The two lived together in [[Greenwich Village]], but moved to "Robber Rocks", a house in [[Patterson, New York]], with friends Slater Brown and his wife Sue, [[Hart Crane]], and [[Malcolm Cowley]].

Tate married Gordon in New York in May 1925. Their daughter Nancy was born in September. In 1928, along with others New York City friends, he went to Europe. In London, he visited with [[T. S. Eliot]], whose poetry and criticism he greatly admired, and he also visited Paris.

In 1928, Tate published his first book of poetry, ''Mr. Pope and Other Poems'', which contained his most famous poem, "[[Ode to the Confederate Dead]]" (not to be confused with "[[Ode: Sung on the Occasion of Decorating the Graves of the Confederate Dead at Magnolia Cemetery, Charleston, S.C., 1867|Ode to the Confederate Dead at Magnolia Cemetery]]" by the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] poet [[Henry Timrod]]). That same year, Tate also published a [[biography]] ''Stonewall Jackson: The Good Soldier''.

Just before leaving for Europe in 1928, Tate described himself to [[John Gould Fletcher]] as "an enforced atheist".&lt;ref&gt;Thomas A. Underwood, ''Allen Tate: Orphan of the South'', Princeton University Press, p. 154. {{ISBN|0-691-06950-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later told Fletcher, "I am an atheist, but a religious one — which means that there is no organization for my religion." He regarded secular attempts to develop a system of thought for the modern world as misguided. "Only God," he insisted, "can give the affair a genuine purpose."&lt;ref&gt;Underwood, ''Allen Tate'', p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt; In his essay "The Fallacy of Humanism" (1929), he criticized the [[New Humanism|New Humanists]] for creating a value system without investing it with any identifiable source of authority. "Religion is the only technique for the validation of values," he wrote.&lt;ref&gt;Underwood, ''Allen Tate'', p. 155&lt;/ref&gt; Although he was attracted to [[Roman Catholicism]], he deferred converting. Louis D. Rubin, Jr. observes that Tate may have waited "because he realized that for him at this time it would be ''only'' a strategy, an intellectual act".&lt;ref&gt;Louis D. Rubin, Jr., ''The Wary Fugitives: Four Poets and the South'', Louisiana State University Press, 1978, p. 125. {{ISBN|0-8071-0454-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1929, Tate published a second biography ''[[Jefferson Davis]]: His Rise and Fall''.

===1930s===
After two years abroad, he returned to the United States, and in 1930 was back in Tennessee. Here he took up residence at [[Riverview (Clarksville, Tennessee)|Riverview]],&lt;ref name="nrhpdocriverview"&gt;{{cite web|url={{NRHP url|id=79002450}}|title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory/Nomination: Riverview |publisher=[[National Park Service]]|author= |date= |accessdate=July 20, 2018}} With {{NRHP url|id=79002450|photos=y|title=accompanying pictures}}&lt;/ref&gt;  an [[Antebellum architecture|antebellum]] mansion with an 85-acre estate attached, that had been bought for him by one of his brothers, "who had made a lot of northern money out of coal." &lt;ref&gt;[[Ian Hamilton (critic)|Ian Hamilton]], ''Against Oblivion: Some Lives of the Twentieth Century Poets'', Viking, 2002, p. 134. {{ISBN|0-670-84909-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; He resumed his senior position with the Fugitives.

Along with fellow Fugitives, Warren and Ransom, as well as nine other Southern writers, Tate also joined the conservative political group known as the [[Southern Agrarians]].&lt;ref&gt;The Twelve Southerners. ''I'll Take My Stand''. New York: Harper and Brothers, 1930.&lt;/ref&gt; The group was made up of 12 members who published essays on their political philosophy in the book ''I'll Take My Stand'' published in 1930. Tate contributed the essay, "Remarks on the Southern Religion" to ''I'll Take My Stand''. This book was followed in 1938 by ''Who Owns America?'', the Southern Agrarians' response to [[The New Deal]].

During this time, Tate also became the ''de facto'' associate editor of ''[[The American Review (literary journal)|The American Review]]'', which was published and edited by [[Seward Collins]].  Tate believed ''The American Review'' could popularize the work of the [[Southern Agrarians]].  He  objected to Collins's open support of [[Benito Mussolini]] and [[Adolf Hitler]], and condemned [[Fascism]] in an article in ''[[The New Republic]]'' in 1936.   Much of Tate's major volumes of poetry were published in the 1930s, and the scholar David Havird describes this publication history in poetry as follows: &lt;blockquote&gt;By 1937, when he published his first ''Selected Poems'', Tate had written all of the shorter poems upon which his literary reputation came to rest. This collection--which brought together work from two recent volumes, ''Poems: 1928-1931'' (1932) and the privately printed ''The Mediterranean and Other Poems'' (1936), as well as the early ''Mr. Pope''--included "Mother and Son," "Last Days of Alice," "The Wolves," "The Mediterranean," "Aeneas at Washington," "Sonnets at Christmas," and the final version of "[[Ode to the Confederate Dead]]."&lt;ref&gt;Havird, David. ''American National Biography''. New York: Oxford University Press, 1999. Copyright © 1999 by the American Council of Learned Societies.[http://www.english.illinois.edu/maps/poets/s_z/tate/life.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1938 Tate published his only novel, ''The Fathers'', which drew upon knowledge of his mother's ancestral home and family in [[Fairfax County, Virginia]].

===1940s===
Tate and Gordon were divorced in 1945 and remarried in 1946. Though devoted to one another for life, they could not get along and later divorced again.

Tate was a poet-in-residence at [[Princeton University]] until 1942. He founded the Creative Writing program at Princeton, and mentored [[Richard Blackmur]], [[John Berryman]], and others. In 1942, Tate assisted novelist and friend [[Andrew Nelson Lytle|Andrew Lytle]] in transforming ''The [[Sewanee Review]]'', America's oldest literary quarterly, from a modest journal into one of the most prestigious in the nation.  Tate and Lytle had attended Vanderbilt together prior to collaborating at [[Sewanee, The University of the South|The University of the South]].

===1950s===
In 1950, Tate converted to Roman Catholicism.&lt;ref&gt;Henry L. Carrigan, Jr., "Three Catholic Writers of the South", ''The Christian Century'', 26 February 1986, pp. 216-17.&lt;/ref&gt; He also married the poet Isabella Gardner in the early 1950s.

===1960s===
While teaching at the [[University of Minnesota]] in [[Minneapolis]], he met Helen Heinz, a nun enrolled in one of his courses and began an affair with her.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} Tate divorced Gardner and married Heinz in 1966. They moved to [[Sewanee, Tennessee]]. In 1967, Tate became the father of twin sons. The youngest died at eleven months from an accident. A third son was born in 1969. Tate died in [[Nashville, Tennessee]] ten years later. His papers are collected at the Firestone Library at [[Princeton University]].

==Attitudes on race==

Literary scholars have questioned the relationship between the cultural attitudes of Modernist poets on issue such as race and the writing produced by these poets. The decade of the 1930s saw Tate's most notable stances on matters that may or may not be connected to literary craft. For example, though Tate spoke well of the work of fellow Modernist poet [[Langston Hughes]], in 1931, Tate pressured his colleague Thomas Mabry into canceling a reception for Hughes, comparing the idea of socializing with the black poet to meeting socially with his black cook.&lt;ref&gt;Arnold Rampersad, ''The Life of Langston Hughes'', Vol. 1, Oxford University Press, 2002, p. 231.&lt;/ref&gt;
	
From the 1930s until as late as the 1960s, Tate held prejudices against both blacks and [[Jews]]. He expressed views against interracial marriage and [[miscegenation]] and refused to associate with Black writers (like the aforementioned [[Langston Hughes]]).&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Underwood. ''Allen Tate: Orphan of the South'', Princeton University Press, 2003, p. 291.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Arnold Rampersad, ''The Life of Langston Hughes'', Vol. 1, Oxford University Press, 2002, p. 231.&lt;/ref&gt; Up until the 1960s, Tate also believed in [[white supremacy]].&lt;ref&gt;Allen Tate, "A View of the White South," ''The American Review'' 2:4 (February 1934).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also Hamilton, ''Against Oblivion'', pp. 135-36.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Allen Tate: Orphan of the South'', Princeton University Press, 2003, p. 151.&lt;/ref&gt;
	
In 1933, Tate wrote a letter for ''Hound &amp; Horn'' explaining his views on interracial sex. "The negro race is an inferior race....miscegenation due to a white woman and a negro man" threatened the white family. "Our purpose..is to keep the negro blood from passing into the white race."&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Underwood. ''Allen Tate: Orphan of the South'', Princeton University Press, 2003, p. 291.&lt;/ref&gt;
	 
According to the critic [[Ian Hamilton (critic)|Ian Hamilton]], Tate and his co-agrarians had been more than ready at the time to overlook the anti-Semitism of the ''American Review'' in order to promote their 'spiritual' defence of the Deep South's traditions. In a 1934 review, "A View of the Whole South"&lt;ref&gt;Allen Tate, ''The American Review'' 2:4 (February 1934)&lt;/ref&gt; Tate reviews W. T. Couch's "Culture in The South: A Symposium by Thirty-one Authors" and defends racial hegemony: "I argue it this way: the white race seems determined to rule the Negro race in its midst; I belong to the white race; therefore I intend to support white rule. [[Lynching]] is a symptom of weak, inefficient rule; but you can't destroy lynching by fiat or social agitation; lynching will disappear when the white race is satisfied that its supremacy will not be questioned in social crises." &lt;ref&gt;Allen Tate, "A View of the White South," ''The American Review'' 2:4 (February 1934).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also Hamilton, ''Against Oblivion'', pp. 135-36.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the poetry editor of ''[[The New Criterion]]'', [[David Yezzi]], Tate held the conventional social views of a white Southerner in 1934: an "inherited racism, a Southern legacy rooted in place and time that Tate later renounced."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Yezzi|first=David|title=The Violence of Allen Tate|journal=The New Criterion|volume=20|issue=September 2001|pages=66}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tate was born of a Scotch-Irish lumber manager whose business failures required moving several times per year, Tate said of his upbringing ""we might as well have been living, and I been born, in a tavern at a crossroads."&lt;ref&gt;Paul V. Murphy, ''The Rebuke of History: The Southern Agrarians and American Conservative Thought''. University of North Carolina Press, 2001, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; However, his views on race were not passively incorporated; Thomas Underwood documents Tate's pursuit of racist ideology: "Tate also drew ideas from nineteenth-century proslavery theorists such as [[Thomas Roderick Dew]], a professor at [[The College of William and Mary]], and [[William Harper (South Carolina)|William Harper]], of the [[University of South Carolina]] — "We must revive these men, he said."&lt;ref&gt;''Allen Tate: Orphan of the South'', Princeton University Press, 2003, p. 151.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Professor Andrew McIntosh's directorship of Truth in Science, and his promotion of that organisation's views, are unconnected to his teaching or research at the University of Leeds in his role as a professor of thermodynamics. As an academic institution, the University wishes to distance itself publicly from theories of creationism and so-called intelligent design which cannot be verified by evidence."&lt;/ref&gt;

His research-group has received the ''outstanding contribution to innovation and technology'' award at the Times Higher Education awards in London in 2010 for developing a technology based on the [[Bombardier beetle#Defense mechanism|defence mechanism]] of bombardier-beetle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Beetle defence inspires uni work|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-leeds-11959381|work=BBC News|date=9 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Creationism ==
In a 2007 discussion with [[Richard Dawkins]] on [[BBC Radio Ulster]], McIntosh argued that the principles of thermodynamics are not consistent with [[Darwinian evolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Crawley|first1=William|title=BBC - Will &amp; Testament: The Thermodynamics of Andy McIntosh|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/ni/2007/01/the_thermodynamics_of_andy_mci.html|date=7 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2006, the University of Leeds issued a statement distancing itself from creationism, and noted that McIntosh's directorship of Truth in Science is unconnected with his teaching or research.&lt;ref name="Leeds" /&gt;

The Arizona Republican Primary took place on March 22 in the U.S. state of [[Arizona]] as one of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]'s primaries ahead of the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 presidential election]]. Despite a late challenge by Texas Senator Ted Cruz, Donald Trump won the primary and netted all 58 delegates in the [[Plurality voting method|winner-take-all]] contest.
On the same day were held [[Arizona Democratic primary, 2016|Democratic]] and Green primaries in Arizona, as well as Republican and Democratic caucuses in Utah and Idaho Democratic caucus, so the day was dubbed "Western Tuesday" by media.

== Voter suppression controversy ==
[[File:Donald_Trump_by_Gage_Skidmore_5.jpg|thumb|250x250px|Businessman Donald Trump at a campaign rally at Fountain Park in [[Fountain Hills, Arizona|Fountain Hills]] on March 19, 2016.]]
[[File:Ted_Cruz_by_Gage_Skidmore_10.jpg|thumb|250x250px|Senator Ted Cruz at a campaign rally at [[Arizona Christian University]] in Phoenix on March 18, 2016.]]
There was controversy surrounding the Arizona primary elections of 2016, specifically having to do with the decrease in polling places in [[Maricopa County]] from 200 in 2012 to only 60 in 2016, despite the number of registered voters having increased from 300,000 in 2012 to 800,000 in 2016.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/04/05/politics/justice-department-investigation-arizona/index.html|title=DOJ looking into voter suppression claims in Arizona|last=CNN|first=Eugene Scott|website=CNN|access-date=2016-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/03/22/live-arizona-primary-coverage-presidential-preference-election/82096726/|title=Arizona primary: Maricopa County had one polling site for every 21,000 voters|website=azcentral|access-date=2016-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; This decrease in polling places was most pronounced in minority neighborhoods, most notably [[Latino]] neighborhoods, with areas like Central Phoenix having only one polling place for 108,000 voters. There were also reports of voters who had been previously registered coming up as unregistered or registered as an independent, making them ineligible to vote in the closed primary.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Voters who did manage to vote had to stand in long lines to cast their ballots, some for as long as five hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/other/president_obama_job_approval-1044.html|title=Election Other – President Obama Job Approval|publisher=RealClearPolitics|accessdate=March 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, voters reported being required to vote with a provisional ballot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/04/obama-approval-ratings-swing-states-117019.html|title=Clinton’s Real Opponent: Barack Obama|date=May 11, 2015|publisher=Politico|last1=Sabato|first1=Larry J.|accessdate=March 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, Arizona threw out 27,878 provisional ballots, counting only about 72.5% of the total provisional ballots reported.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.votersunite.org/article.asp?id=4738|title=Counties inconsistent in provisional-vote rules|last=Beal|first=Tom|date=29 January 2005|website=votersunite.org|publisher=Arizona Daily Star|access-date=March 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taking into account the effects of the Supreme Court's "gutting of the Voting Rights Act",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/06/25/voting-rights-act-supreme-court_n_3429810.html|title=Voting Rights Act Section 4 Struck Down By Supreme Court|date=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; it's unknown what percentage of the provisional ballots were counted in 2016. This was the first election in the state of Arizona since the 2013 [[Shelby County v. Holder|Supreme Court decision]] to strike down Section 5 of the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]], which would have previously required states with a history of voter discrimination, including Arizona, to receive Federal approval before implementing any changes to voting laws and practices.

Within a day after the election took place on March 22, a petition went viral on the White House petitions site asking the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] to investigate voter suppression and election fraud in Arizona.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.12news.com/news/politics/petition-to-white-house-about-arizona-voter-suppression-hit-goal-in-about-40-hours/101986939|title=Petition to White House about Arizona 'voter suppression' hit goal in about 40 hours|date=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The petition reached 100,000 signatures in 40 hours,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.12news.com/news/politics/petition-to-white-house-about-arizona-voter-suppression-hit-goal-in-about-40-hours/101986939|title=Petition to White House about Arizona 'voter suppression' hit goal in about 40 hours|last=TEGNA|website=KPNX|language=en-US|access-date=2016-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as of June 5, 2016, nearly 220,000 people have signed the petition. The White House responded on May 20, 2016. In addition, Phoenix mayor [[Greg Stanton]] asked the Justice Department to launch an investigation into the allegations of voter suppression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/20/upshot/what-a-rise-in-obamas-approval-rating-means-for-2016.html?abt=0002&amp;abg=0|title=What a Rise in Obama’s Approval Rating Means for 2016|date=January 16, 2015|work=[[The New York Times]]|last1=Cohn|first1=Nate|accessdate=March 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Department of Justice has since launched a federal investigation into the primary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/justice-department-arizona_us_5702b720e4b083f5c6085933|title=The DOJ Is Investigating Arizona's Election Mess|date=April 4, 2016|publisher=The Huffington Post|last2=Reilly|first2=Ryan J.|last1=Lachman|first1=Samantha|accessdate=April 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Results==
{{2016AZRep}}

==Analysis==
Donald Trump won Arizona decisively, netting all 58 delegates and carrying all counties in the state but two. As [[The New York Times]] described, "Mr. Trump proved his appeal among [[immigration]] hard-liners, who make up a large bloc of [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] in the [[Mexico–United States border|border]] state."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/23/us/politics/election-results.html|title=Clinton and Trump Win Arizona; Cruz Picks Up Utah; Sanders Takes 2|last=Martin|first=Jonathan|date=2016-03-22|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trump won the populous cities of [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] in [[Maricopa County, Arizona|Maricopa County]], and [[Tucson, Arizona|Tucson]] in [[Pima County, Arizona|Pima County]]. He enjoyed support from former [[List of Governors of Arizona|Arizona Governor]] [[Jan Brewer]] and Maricopa [[Sheriffs in the United States|County Sheriff]] [[Joe Arpaio]], both of whom hold a hard-line stance against immigration. As Eric Bradner of CNN described, "Their decision to side with Trump, and the size of his win, underscores the potency of Trump's build-a-wall plan with the Republican base."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/03/23/politics/primary-election-2016-takeaways/index.html|title=5 takeaways from Western Tuesday|last=CNN|first=Eric Bradner|website=CNN|access-date=2016-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6495">'''Autoreduction''' (based on the French term [[:fr:autoréduction|autoréduction]]) is an [[anti-capitalist]] and collective practice of a group of people to impose a lower price of a product or service until it is free. A group of consumers take upon themselves to reduce the price of some good or service, and act collectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://libcom.org/history/autoreduction-movements-turin-1974 |title=Autoreduction movements in Turin, 1974 |date=November 17, 2009 |publisher=libcom.org |accessdate=August 15, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This could include collectively engaging in shoplifting, avoiding paying transit fares or for tickets to enter movies, or calling in sick for work.&lt;ref name=Woodhead&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metrotimes.com/detroit/talking-thrash-with-the-bay-areas-trash-talk/Content?oid=2470143 |title=Talking thrash with the Bay Area's Trash Talk |author=Adam Woodhead |date=October 26, 2016 |publisher=''[[Metro Times]]'' |accessdate=March 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The targeted service or product is generally considered by activists as being essential and should be available on an equal basis for all people. Critics of autoreduction do not distinguish between this type of practice and criminal theft or robberies.&lt;ref name=Lindahl&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199601684.001.0001/acprof-9780199601684-chapter-2 |title=Legality, Illegality, A-Legality: A Preliminary Analysis |last=Lindahl |first=Hans |doi=10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199601684.003.0002 |work=Fault Lines of Globalization: Legal Order and the Politics of A-Legality |isbn=9780199601684 |date=January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This action takes various forms of non-payment for transportation or goods in supermarkets. It can result from refusal to include an increase in rent or utilities such as electricity, gas, or water. It may be done with the aim of [[reappropriation|redistributing goods]] to those in need.&lt;ref name=Lindahl /&gt;

== Historical examples ==

In Italy, [[rent strike]]s are numerous and affected several large cities (Rome, Milan, and Turin) in the mid-1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://viewpointmag.com/2015/11/01/feminism-autonomism-1970s-italy/ |title=Mapping the Terrain of Struggle: Autonomous Movements in 1970s Italy |publisher=Viewpoint Magazine |first=Patrick |last=Cuninghame |date=November 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.prole.info/pamphlets/autonomousitaly.pdf |title=Class Struggle in Italy: 1960's to 70's |website=prole.info}}&lt;/ref&gt; This reappropriation of the proletarian practice was systematized by the autonomous movement also spoke of immediate communism. In France, this was the case in the rent strike in [[Sonacotra]] in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Jean-Philippe |last=Dedieu |first2=Aïssatou |last2=Mbodj-Pouye |title=The First Collective Protest of Black African Migrants in Post-colonial France (1960-1975).

The [[Autonomia]] movement in 1977 involved activities of autoreduction, and had the result of spaces being created where principles like anti-capitalism are popular, among the related themes in [[Punk rock|punk]] and [[Hardcore punk|hardcore]] music.&lt;ref name=Woodhead /&gt;

After a lull in the practice of this type of action, there was a renewed interest in 2008: the social crisis caused by market speculation appears to be a favorable environment for the revival of the practice. In late 2008, several autoreductions were organized by politicized groups with precarious workers, unemployed, intermittent, and students in struggle, including Paris, Rennes, and Grenoble.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cip-idf.org/article.php3?id_article=4180 |title=Autoréduction au Monoprix le 31 décembre : Nous ne paierons pas. |language=fr |trans-title=Autoréduction at Monoprix December 31: We will not pay. |publisher=CIP-IDF.org |date=December 31, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cip-idf.org/article.php3?id_article=4170 |title=Autoréduction aux Galeries Lafayette à Grenoble |language=fr |trans-title=Autoreduction at Galeries Lafayette in Grenoble |date=December 28, 2008 |publisher=CIP-IDF.org |accessdate=August 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Requisitions in supermarkets ==

Autoreduction may also be done regarding food in supermarkets. The action involves shopping for foods and refusing to pay.&lt;ref name=Lindahl /&gt; After blocking checkout lanes in protest, dialogue is initiated with management. The militants rely on the time of blocking the credit union that may represent a loss to the company based on the amount of requisitioned products in shopping carts, as some customers decide to abandon their purchases because of the situation. If management agrees to allow the militants to leave with their carts, it is not legally a flight, but extortion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.maitre-eolas.fr/post/2009/01/05/1263-autoreduction-ou-extorsion |title=Autoréduction, ou extorsion ? |language=fr |trans-title=Autoreduction, or extortion ? |author=Eolas |date=January 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Requisitioned products are then collectively shared or distributed in neighborhoods, to show the militant and selfless character of the action.

== Public transport ==

The practice of autoreduction in public transportation is to travel in large numbers via public transit without paying, and distributing leaflets among passengers traveling at the same time. The stated aim is to make this type of transport free in the city, as it may already be in other cities in the country. This approach has an ecological dimension, with a view that free public transport would encourage its use and reduce the number of cars in the city, thereby reducing pollution. This type of action has been taken over by militant environmental movements in the [[Camp for Climate Action]], for example.

In [[Malaysia]]n political and constitutional terminology, a caretaker government is a [[government of Malaysia]] during a period that starts when the [[Parliament of Malaysia|parliament]] is dissolved by the [[Yang di-Pertuan Agong]] prior to a general election, and continues for a period after the election, until the next cabinet is appointed. A caretaker government is expected to conduct itself in accordance with a series of well-defined conventions that are administered by the [[Prime Minister's Department (Malaysia)|Prime Minister's Department]], although there is no law compelling the caretaker government to do so.

==Caretaker conventions==
Malaysian constitutional practice calls for a government to continue in office even after parliament has been dissolved, during the election period and then into the next parliament only until the next government can be formed. The prime minister can, however, resign office and advise the Yang di-Pertuan Agong at any time to appoint a new federal government. The operation of the [[Politics of Malaysia|Malaysian political system]] ensures that a [[Cabinet of Malaysia|Cabinet]] is always maintained and that caretaker governments abide by the conventions.  

A caretaker government operates until the election result clearly indicates that either the incumbent party or coalition has retained power, or in the case where there is to be a change of government, until the new government is appointed by the Yang di-Pertuan Agong. These conventions are not legally binding, and do not constitute "hard and fast rules." In practice, any flouting of the conventions by a caretaker government would immediately come to light, and could go against them in the election campaign.

==Caretaker government conduct==
The Caretaker provisions explicitly recognise that, after the dissolution of parliament, the business of government must continue and that "ordinary matters of administration" must be addressed. Hence the provisions allow for the normal operations of all government departments. However, the caretaker conventions impose some restrictions on the conduct of the caretaker government. The conventions broadly include the following:
* '''Major policy decisions.''' The Government will cease taking major policy decisions except on urgent matters and then only after formal consultation with the Opposition. The conventions apply to the making of decisions, not to their announcement. Accordingly, the conventions are not infringed where decisions made before dissolution are announced during the caretaker period. However, where possible, decisions would normally be announced ahead of dissolution.
* '''Significant appointments.''' The Government will cease making major appointments of public officials, but may make acting or short-term appointments.
* '''Major contracts or undertakings'''. The Government will avoid entering major contracts or undertakings during the caretaker period. If it is not possible to defer the commitment until after the caretaker period, for legal, commercial or other reasons, a minister could consult the Opposition, or agencies could deal with the contractor and ensure that contracts include clauses providing for termination in the event of an incoming government not wishing to proceed. Similar provisions cover tendering.
* '''International negotiations and visits.''' The Government ordinarily seeks to defer such major international negotiations, or adopts observer status, until the end of the caretaker period.
* '''Avoiding PSC involvement in election activities.''' The [[Public Service Commission of Malaysia]] adopts a neutral stance while continuing to advise the Government. There are several cases, notably the pricing of Opposition election promises, in which the PSC conducts an investigation and report for the benefit of the electorate at large.

==Change of government==
When an opposition party or coalition wins enough seats at a general election to be able to command a majority in the [[Dewan Rakyat]], the convention is for the incumbent prime minister (still in caretaker mode) to formally advise the Yang di-Pertuan Agong that he or she is no longer able to govern, and that the Leader of the Opposition should be invited to form a government. The Yang di-Pertuan Agong then requests the incumbent prime minister and his or her ministers to remain in office on a caretaker basis until a new government is sworn in. The Yang di-Pertuan Agong then contacts the Leader of the Opposition and invites them to form a government. The Leader of the Opposition accepts the invitation, and undertakes to inform the Yang di-Pertuan Agong when the new Cabinet is in a position to be sworn in. This can be delayed by the counting of votes in closely contested seats, or by the processes by which ministers are chosen under the relevant party's rules. In the meantime, the caretaker government continues in office.

==Caretaker government at state level==
The same condition of caretaker government also apply to the thirteen states of Malaysia. A caretaker government at state level is a state government during a period that starts when the [[Dewan Undangan Negeri|state assembly]] is dissolved by the sultan / raja / governor prior to a state election, and continues for a period after the election, until the next executive council (known as cabinet in Sabah and Sarawak) is appointed. A caretaker government at state level is expected to conduct itself in accordance with a series of well-defined conventions that are administered by the State Secretariat, although there is no law compelling the caretaker government at state level to do so.

Malaysian constitutional practice calls for a state government to continue in office even after state assembly has been dissolved, during the election period and then into the next state assembly only until the next state government can be formed. The Menteri Besar (or chief minister) can, however, resign office and advise the sultan / raja / governor at any time to appoint a new state government. The operation of the [[Politics of Malaysia|Malaysian political system]] ensures that an executive council (or cabinet) is always maintained and that caretaker governments at state level abide by the conventions.  

A caretaker government at state level operates until the election result clearly indicates that either the incumbent party or coalition has retained power, or in the case where there is to be a change of government, until the new state government is appointed by the sultan / raja / governor. These conventions are not legally binding, and do not constitute "hard and fast rules." In practice, any flouting of the conventions by a caretaker government at state level would immediately come to light, and could go against them in the election campaign.

'''Chlorophyllin''' refers to any one of a group of closely related [[water-soluble]] salts that are [[semisynthesis|semi-synthetic]] derivatives of [[chlorophyll]], differing in the identity of the cations associated with the anion. Its most common form is a [[sodium]]/[[copper]] derivative used as a [[food additive]] and in [[alternative medicine]]. Chlorophyll is present in green leafy vegetables and reaching levels as high as 5.7% in spinach.&lt;ref name="DJCastro" /&gt; As a [[food color]]ing agent, copper complex chlorophyllin is known as natural green 3 and has the [[E number]] E141.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fastcolours.co.uk/duranat-cu-chlorophyllin-wsp-natural-green-3-1-ci-75810-1-714-c.asp|title=Duranat Cu Chlorophyllin WSP (Natural Green 3-1 CI 75810-1)|accessdate=15 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Uses ==

=== Cancer prevention ===
Because chlorophyll does not dissolve in water, food sources of chlorophyll do not bind to [[mutagen]]ic substances to a significant extent. Chlorophyllin, being water-soluble, can significantly bind to environmental mutagens such as the [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon]]s [[Benzo(a)pyrene|benzo[a]pyrene]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Keshava C, Divi RL, Einem TL, Richardson DL, Leonard SL, Keshava N, Poirier MC, Weston A | title=Chlorophyllin significantly reduces benzo[a]pyrene-DNA adduct formation and alters cytochrome P450 1A1 and 1B1 expression and EROD activity in normal human mammary epithelial cells | journal=ENVIRONMENTAL AND MOLECULAR MUTAGENESIS  | volume=50 | issue=2 | year=2009 | pages=134–144  | id= | pmid=19152381 | pmc=2637934 | doi=10.1002/em.20449}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [http://www.iacoc.org.uk/statements/dibenzoalpyrene.htm dibenzo{a,i}pyrene].&lt;ref name="DJCastro"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Castro DJ, Löhr CV, Fischer KA, Waters KM, Webb-Robertson BJ, Dashwood RH, Bailey GS, Williams DE | title= Identifying efficacious approaches to chemoprevention with chlorophyllin, purified chlorophylls and freeze-dried spinach in a mouse model of transplacental carcinogenesi| journal=[[Carcinogenesis (journal)|Carcinogenesis]]  | volume=30 | issue=2 | year=2009 | pages=315–320  | url = http://carcin.oxfordjournals.org/content/30/2/315.long  
| id= | pmid=19073876 | doi=10.1093/carcin/bgn280 | pmc=2722150}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chlorophyllin binds to mutagens twenty times better than [[resveratrol]] and thousands of times better than [[xanthine]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Osowski A, Pietrzak M, Wieczorek Z, Wieczorek J | title=Natural compounds in the human diet and their ability to bind mutagens prevents DNA-mutagen intercalation | journal=JOURNAL OF TOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH, PART A | volume=73 | issue=17-18 | year=2010 | pages=1141–1149  | id= | pmid=20706936 | doi=10.1080/15287394.2010.491044}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Medicine and hygiene ===
Chlorophyllin is the active ingredient in a number of internally taken preparations intended to reduce odors associated with [[Fecal incontinence|incontinence]], [[colostomy|colostomies]] and similar procedures, as well as [[body odor]] in general. It is also available as a topical preparation, purportedly useful for both treatment and odor control of wounds, injuries, and other skin conditions—notably [[radiation burn]]s.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4583">The '''Comptroller and Auditor General''' ('''C&amp;AG''') in the [[United Kingdom]] is the government official responsible for supervising the quality of public accounting and financial reporting. The C&amp;AG is an officer of the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] who is the head of the [[National Audit Office (United Kingdom)|National Audit Office]], the body that scrutinises central government expenditure. 

Under the Budget Responsibility and National Audit Act 2011, the C&amp;AG is appointed by the monarch by [[letters patent]] upon an address of the House of Commons presented by the prime minister with the agreement of the chairman of the [[Public Accounts Committee (United Kingdom)|Public Accounts Committee]], and can only be removed from office by the monarch upon an address of both Houses of Parliament. 

The full title of the office is '''''Comptroller General of the Receipt and Issue of Her Majesty's Exchequer and Auditor General of Public Accounts'''''.

The current C&amp;AG is [[Amyas Morse|Sir Amyas Morse]], who was formerly the Commercial Director at the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]].

==History==

Historically, the [[Comptroller of the Household]] was a position in the [[England|English]] [[royal household]], the second-ranking member of the [[Lord Steward]]'s department. 

The office of [[Comptroller General of the Exchequer]] was created by the Receipt of the Exchequer Act 1834, and had responsibility for authorising the issue of public monies from the Treasury to government departments.

The office of C&amp;AG was created by the [[Exchequer and Audit Departments Act 1866]] which combined the functions of the Comptroller General of the Exchequer with those of the '''Commissioners of Audit''', who had traditionally presented the government accounts to the Treasury.&lt;ref&gt;Exchequer and Audit Departments Act 1866, section 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Under the terms of the Act, the C&amp;AG continued to authorise the issue of money to departments (the comptroller function) and was given the new task of examining departmental accounts and reporting the results to Parliament.  The role has since been replicated in many Commonwealth and foreign countries.

The '''Cyber Storm exercise''' was a [[simulated]] exercise overseen by the [[Department of Homeland Security]] that took place February 6 through February 10, 2006 with the purpose of testing the nation's defenses against [[Hacker (computer security)|digital espionage]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.dhs.gov/xnews/releases/pr_1158340980371.shtm Fact Sheet: Cyber Storm Exercise] ([[Department of Homeland Security]]). Accessed February 1, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.dhs.gov/xlibrary/assets/prep_cyberstormreport_sep06.pdf Cyber Storm Exercise Report] (Department of Homeland Security)&lt;/ref&gt; The simulation was targeted primarily at American security organizations but officials from the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and New Zealand participated as well.&lt;ref&gt;Kapica, Jack. [https://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20080131.WBcyberia20080131112514/WBStory/WBcyberia A blogger’s paranoia], [[The Globe and Mail]], Accessed February 1, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Simulation ==
The exercise simulated a large scale attack on critical digital infrastructure such as [[communications]], [[transportation]], and [[energy production]]. The simulation took place a series of incidents which included:

*[[Washington, D.C. Metro]] trains mysteriously shutting down.
*[[Bloggers]] revealing locations of railcars containing hazardous materials.
*The [[Control tower|airport control towers]] of [[Philadelphia]] and Chicago mysteriously shutting down.
*A mysterious liquid appearing on a London subway.
*Significant numbers of people on [[No Fly List|"no fly" lists]] suddenly appearing at airports all over the nation.
*Planes flying too close to the [[White House]].
*Water utilities in Los Angeles getting compromised.

== Internal difficulties ==
During the exercise the computers running the simulation came under attack by the players themselves. Heavily censored files released to the [[Associated Press]] reveal that at some time during the exercise the organizers sent every one involved an [[e-mail]] marked "IMPORTANT!" telling the participants in the simulation not to attack the game's control computers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cybertalkblog.co.uk/cyber-news-blog/cyber-war-games-highlight-vital-security-flaws/|title=Cyber ‘War’ Games Highlight Vital Security Flaws|website=www.cybertalkblog.co.uk|language=en-US|access-date=2017-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Performance of participants ==
The Cyber Storm exercise highlighted the gaps and shortcomings of the nation's cyber defenses. The cyber storm exercise report found that institutions under attack had a hard time getting the bigger picture and instead focused on single incidents treating them as "individual and discrete".&lt;ref&gt;Wait, Patience.

Accessed February 1, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In light of the test the Department of Homeland Security raised concern that the relatively modest resources assigned to cyber-defense would be "overwhelmed in a real attack".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.securityfocus.com/brief/303 DHS releases report on Cyber Storm exercise].

'''Escheat''' {{IPAc-en|ᵻ|s|ˈ|tʃ|iː|t}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Escheat|url=http://howjsay.com|accessdate=2 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Walker|first=John|title=A Critical Pronouncing Dictionary and Expositor of the English Language|year=1838|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gO97flqb_-cC&amp;lpg=PR1&amp;dq=pronounce%20escheat%20english&amp;pg=PR1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|isbn=9781402171710}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[common law]] doctrine that transfers the [[real property]] of a person who died without heirs to the Crown or state. It serves  to ensure that property is not left in "limbo" without recognized ownership.  It originally applied to a number of situations where a legal interest in land was destroyed by [[operation of law]], so that the ownership of the land reverted to the immediately superior [[feudalism|feudal]] lord.

==Etymology==
The term "escheat" derives ultimately from the Latin ''ex-cadere'', to "fall-out", via mediaeval French ''escheoir''.&lt;ref&gt;Collins Dictionary of the English Language, London, 1986, p.520&lt;/ref&gt; The sense is of a feudal [[estate in land]] falling-out of the possession by a family into possession by the overlord.

==Origins in feudalism==
In feudal England, escheat  referred to the situation where the tenant of a [[fief|fee]] (or "fief") died without an heir or committed a [[felony]]. In the case of such demise of a [[tenant-in-chief]], the fee reverted to the King's [[demesne]] permanently, when it became once again a mere tenantless plot of land,  but could be re-created as a fee by enfeoffment to another of the king's followers. Where the deceased had been [[subinfeudation|subinfeudated]] by a tenant-in-chief, the fee reverted temporarily to the crown  for [[Year and a day rule|one year and one day]] by right of ''[[seisin|primer seisin]]'' after which it escheated to the  over-lord who had granted it to the deceased by enfeoffment. From the time of [[Henry III of England|Henry III]], the monarchy took particular interest in escheat as a source of revenue.

===Background===
At the [[Norman Conquest of England]] all the land of England was claimed as the personal possession of [[William the Conqueror]] under [[allodial title]]. The monarch thus became the sole "owner" of all the land in the kingdom, a position which persists to the present day. He then granted it out to his favoured followers, who thereby became [[tenant-in-chief|tenants-in-chief]], under various contracts of [[feudal land tenure]]. Such tenures, even the highest one of "[[English feudal barony|feudal barony]]", never conferred ownership of land but merely ownership of rights over it, that is to say ownership of an [[estate in land]]. Such persons are therefore correctly termed "land-holders" or "tenants" (from Latin ''teneo'' to hold), not owners. If held freely, that is to say by [[Freehold (law)|freehold]], such holdings were heritable by the holder's legal heir. On the payment  of a premium termed [[feudal relief]] to the [[treasury]], such heir was entitled to demand [[enfeoffment|re-enfeoffment]] by the king with the [[fief|fee]] concerned.

Where no legal heir existed, the logic of the situation was  that the fief had ceased to exist as a legal entity, since being tenantless no one was living who had been enfeoffed with the land, and the land was thus technically owned by either the crown or the immediate overlord (where the fee had been [[subinfeudated]] by the [[tenant-in-chief]] to a [[mesne lord]], and perhaps the process of subinfeudation had been continued by a lower series of mesne-lords) as [[ultimus heres]]. Logically therefore it was in the occupation of the crown alone, that is to say in the royal [[demesne]]. This was the basic operation of an escheat ([[excadere]]), a failure of heirs.

Escheat could also take place if a tenant was outlawed or convicted of a felony, when the King could exercise the ancient right of wasting the criminal's land for a year and a day, and after that the land would return to the lord. (However, one guilty of treason (rather than felony) forfeited all lands to the King.  John and his heirs frequently insisted on seizing ''terrae Normannorum'', "lands of the Normans", the English land of those who preferred to be Normans rather than Englishmen when the victories of [[Philip II of France|Philip Augustus]] forced a proclamation of allegiance.)  Since disavowal of a feudal bond was considered a felony, lords could escheat land from those who refused to be true to their feudal services.  On the other hand, there were tenants who were sluggish in performing their duties, while not being outright rebellious against the lord.  Remedies in the courts against this sort of thing, even in [[Henry de Bracton|Bracton]]'s day, were available, but were considered laborious and frequently ineffectual in compelling the desired performance.  The commonest mechanism would be [[distraint]], also called distress (districtio): the lord would seize some chattel, and hold it until performance was achieved.  This practice had been dealt with in the 1267 [[Statute of Marlborough]].  Even so, it remained the most common extrajudicial method applied by the lords at the time of Quia Emptores.&lt;ref&gt;Pollock and Maitland, History of English Law, Vol 1, pp.&amp;nbsp;355–366, Cambridge University Press, 1968&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, under English common law, there were two main ways an escheat could happen:
# A person's property escheated if he was convicted of a [[felony]] (but not [[treason]], when the property was [[Asset forfeiture|forfeit]]ed to the Crown).  If the person was [[capital punishment|executed]] for the crime, his heirs were [[Attainder|attainted]], i.e. ineligible to inherit. In most common-law jurisdictions, this type of escheat has been abolished outright, for example  in the [[United States]] under [[Article Three of the United States Constitution#Section 3: Treason|Article 3 § 3]] of the [[United States Constitution]], which states that [[bill of attainder|attainders]] for [[treason]] do not give rise to posthumous forfeiture, or "corruption of blood".
# If a person had no [[heir]] to receive their property under a [[Will (law)|will]] or under the laws of [[intestacy]], then any property  he owned at death would escheat.  This rule has been replaced in most common-law jurisdictions by ''[[bona vacantia]]'' or a similar concept.

==Procedure==
From the 12th century onward, the Crown appointed ''escheators'' to manage escheats and report to the [[Exchequer]], with one escheator per [[county]] established by the middle of the 14th century. Upon  the death of a tenant-in-chief, the escheator would be instructed by a writ of ''diem clausit extremum'' ("he has closed his last day", i.e. he is dead) issued by the king's [[Court of Chancery|chancery]], to empanel a jury to hold an "[[Escheat roll|inquisition ''post mortem'']]" to ascertain who the legal heir was, if any, and what was the extent of the land held. Thus it would be revealed whether the king had any rights to the land. It was also important for the king to know who the heir was, and to assess his personal qualities, since he would thenceforth form a constituent part of the royal army, if he held under [[feudal land tenure|military tenure]]. If there was any doubt, the escheator would seize the land and refer the case to the king's  court where it would be settled, ensuring that not one day's revenue would be lost. This would be a source of concern with land-holders when there were delays from the court.

==Current operation==
[[File:Jury finding Kentucky County Virginia John Connolly Daniel Boone 1780.jpg|thumb|Jury finding from [[Kentucky County, Virginia]] County Court from an inquest of escheat. A twelve-man panel adjudged John Connolly and Alexander McKee to be [[British citizen]]s within the meaning of the Virginia Assembly Act of 1779 concerning British subjects and their rights under Virginia law. (The Assembly had seized Connolly's claims prior to the inquest.) The jury found that the lands of Connolly and McKee were [[Forfeiture (law)|forfeited]] as they were British (and not American) citizens. [[Daniel Boone]] was listed as member of jury. (July 1780)]]

Most common-law jurisdictions have abolished the concept of [[feudal land tenure]] of property, and so the concept of escheat has lost something of its meaning. In [[England and Wales]], the possibility of escheat of a deceased person's property to the feudal overlord was abolished by the [[Administration of Estates Act 1925]]; however, the concept of [[Bona vacantia]] means that the crown (or [[Duchy of Cornwall]] or [[Duchy of Lancaster]]) can still receive such property if no-one else can be found who is eligible to inherit it.

The term is often now applied to the transfer of the title to a person's property to the state when the person dies [[intestate]] without any other person capable of taking the property as [[heir]]. For example, a common-law jurisdiction's intestacy statute might provide that when someone dies without a [[Will (law)|will]], and is not survived by a spouse, descendants, parents, grandparents, descendants of parents, children or grandchildren of grandparents, or great-grandchildren of grandparents, then the person's estate will escheat to the state.

In some jurisdictions, escheat can also occur when an entity, typically a bank, credit union or other financial institution, holds money or property which appears to be  unclaimed, for instance due to a lack of activity on the account by way of deposits, withdrawals or any other transactions for a lengthy time in a cash account.  In many jurisdictions, if the owner cannot be located, such property can be revocably escheated to the state.

In commerce, it is the process of reassigning legal title in unclaimed or abandoned payroll checks, insurance payouts, or stocks and shares whose owners cannot be traced, to a state authority (in the United States). A company is required to file unclaimed property reports with its state annually and, in some jurisdictions, to make a good-faith effort to find the owners of their dormant accounts.  The escheating criteria are set by individual state regulations.

===England and Wales===

====Bankruptcies and liquidations====
Escheat can still occur in [[England and Wales]], if a person is made [[bankrupt]] or a [[corporation]] is [[liquidation|liquidated]]. Usually this means that all the property held by that person is 'vested in' (transferred to) the [[Official Receiver]] or [[Trustee in Bankruptcy]]. However, it is open to the Receiver or Trustee to refuse to accept that property by [[disclaimer|disclaiming]] it. It is relatively common for a trustee in bankruptcy to disclaim freehold property which may give rise to a liability, for example the common parts of a block of [[Apartment|flats]] owned by the bankrupt would ordinarily pass to the trustee to be realised in order to pay his debts, but the property may give the landlord an obligation to spend money for the benefit of lessees of the flats. The bankruptcy of the original owner means that the freehold is no longer the bankrupt's legal property, and the disclaimer destroys the freehold [[Estate (law)|estate]], so that the land ceases to be owned by anyone and effectively escheats to become land held by the Crown in [[demesne]].  This situation affects a few hundred properties each year.

Although such escheated property is owned by the Crown, it is not part of the [[Crown Estate]], unless the Crown (through the [[Crown Estate Commissioners]]) 'completes' the escheat, by taking steps to exert rights as owner. However, usually, in the example given above, the tenants of the flats, or their [[mortgage law|mortgagees]] would exercise their rights given by the [[Insolvency Act 1986]] to have the freehold property transferred to them. This is the main difference between escheat and ''bona vacantia'', as in the latter, a grant takes place automatically, with no need to 'complete' the transaction.

====Registration of Crown land====
One consequence of the [[Land Registration Act 1925]] was that only [[estates in land]] (freehold or leasehold) could be registered. Land held directly by the Crown, known as property in the "royal [[demesne]]", is not held under any [[Vestige|vestigial]] feudal tenure (the crown has no historical overlord other than, for brief periods, the papacy) and there is therefore no estate to register. This  had the consequence that freeholds which escheated to the Crown ceased to be registrable. This created a slow drain of property out of registration, amounting to some hundreds of freehold titles in each year.

The problem was noted by the [[Law Commission]] in their report "Land Registration for the Twenty-First Century". The [[Land Registration Act 2002]] was passed in response to that report. It provides that land held in demesne by the Crown may be registered.

=== United States ===

==== Transfer Agents and Escheatment ====
Escheatment is the process of returning lost or unclaimed property to state’s governments for safekeeping until the owner(s) is identified. Jurisdiction for the state is determined by last known address. Every state has laws regarding escheatment, whose holding periods typically range around five years. The concept behind escheatment is that all property has a legally recognized owner. If the owner cannot be found in a timely manner, then the government is presumed to be the owner.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/escheat.asp|title=Escheat|last=Staff|first=Investopedia|date=2003-11-18|work=Investopedia|access-date=2018-01-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Escheats are performed on what is called a ''revocable basis''. This means if lost property is escheated to a state, then the original owner is subsequently found, the original escheat is revoked and ownership of the property returns to the rightful owner.

==== Lost Shareholders ====
According to SEC Rule 17 CFR 240.17f-1: Transfer Agents are obligated by the SEC to report to Commission (specifically to its designee; the SEC's Securities Information System) anytime a certificate is known to be lost or missing for at least 2 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/17/240.17f-1|title=17 CFR 240.17f-1 - Requirements for reporting and inquiry with respect to missing, lost, counterfeit or stolen securities.|website=LII / Legal Information Institute|language=en|access-date=2018-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Transfer Agents must search for the holder's SSN or EIN utilizing an information database system, or if not available, exercise their best effort to match the holder's name and address through these systems. ''All'' Transfer Agents ''must'' report ''all'' lost or missing certificates/shareholders on their own annual filings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= https://westcoaststocktransfer.com/escheatment |title= Escheatment |language=en |access-date= 2018-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2178">'''Estonianization''' is the changing of one's personal names from other languages into Estonian, or the development of [[Estonian language]], culture and identity within educational and other state institutions through various programs.

==Family names==
Before 1920, some fifty percent of Estonian surnames were of foreign origin.&lt;ref&gt;George Kurman, ''The Development Of Written Estonian'', Routledge 1997, {{ISBN|0-7007-0380-2}}, page 85&lt;/ref&gt;
At the beginning of the 1930s, [[President of Estonia|president]] [[Konstantin Päts]] introduced a nationwide Estonianization program for family names. During this campaign thousands of Estonian citizens living in [[Estonia]] voluntarily changed their original family names.

===Notable estonianized names===
*Karl August Einbund → [[Kaarel Eenpalu]]
*Gerhardt Esperk → [[Ants Eskola]]
*Harald Rudolf Klein → [[Ruut Tarmo]]
*Hans Laipman → [[Ants Laikmaa]]
*Kristjan Trossmann → [[Kristjan Palusalu]]

==Integration==
The integration policy is aimed at strengthening of Estonian identity among the nation's populace, to develop shared values, identity, and pride in being a citizen of Estonia; with respect and acceptance of cultural differences among Estonian residents.

===Education===
On 14 March 2000 the [[Government of Estonia]] adopted “State Programme “Integration in Estonian society 2000-2007". Main areas and aims of the integration established by the program are linguistic-communicative, legal-political and socio-economical. The Program has four sub programs: education, the education and culture of national minorities, the teaching of Estonian to adults and social competence. The aim of the sub-programs is to be achieved via the learning of the Estonian language by children and adults.

'''Europe United Party''' was a [[European political party|pan-European]] political party which aimed to achieve a stronger and more accountable [[European Union]] and especially a [[democracy|democratically]] elected [[European Commission]], a more transparent [[European Council]] and a stronger, more representative and effective [[European Parliament]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Europe United Party.

Europe United was founded as a pro-European organisation in 2005 by [[Finland|Finnish]], but [[Denmark|Danish]]-based politician [[Aki Paasovaara]] shortly after France and the [[Netherlands]] voted down the proposed [[European constitution]]. The party grew fast thanks to engaging its members through an online private social network.In September 2005 Europe United officially registered as a political [[Voluntary association|association]] in [[Denmark]]. The first [[Political convention|convention]] was held in May 2006 at the then-official seat of the organisation in [[Copenhagen]] (Denmark).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The New Federalist. "Europe United: we need truly pan-European political parties"|url=http://www.thenewfederalist.eu/Europe-United-we-need-truly-pan-European-political-parties|accessdate=21 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the Copenhagen convention, the first election to Europe United's internal policy-making body, the Senate, was held. Tomas Ruta got most votes out of the thirty elected senators.

The President and the board of Europe United were [[elections|elected]] by a Convention for a two-year period and functioned as the party's European-level management. Their prime responsibilities were overall strategic leadership and operational leadership of the party's administration and organisational functions.

So far, only a limited political program with a focus on democratization of the EU was presented. Agreement on a broad selection of political issues was found at the Convention in [[Leuven]] ([[Belgium]]) in December 2009 and a final vote on the political program of Europe United was planned for the next Convention in [[Salzburg]] ([[Austria]]) in May 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Europe United Party.

Europe United presented five [[candidate]]s for the [[European Parliament election, 2009|2009 European Parliament election]] but failed to secure any seats.

The '''European Consortium for Political Research''' ('''ECPR''') is an independent scholarly association that supports and encourages the training, research and cross-national cooperation of many thousands of academics and graduate students specialising in political science and all its sub-disciplines. ECPR membership is institutional rather than individual and, at its inception in 1970, comprised eight members ([[University of Bergen|Bergen]], [[University of Gothenburg|Gothenburg]], [[University of Essex|Essex]], [[Leiden University|Leiden]], [[University of Mannheim|Mannheim]], [[Nuffield College]] ([[University of Oxford|Oxford]]), [[University of Strathclyde|Strathclyde]] and [[Fondation Nationale des Sciences Politiques|Paris (FNSP)]]). Membership has now grown to encompass more than 350 institutions throughout [[Europe]], with associate members spread across the world.

;ECPR activities include
* Organising workshops, roundtables, conferences and summer schools
* Publishing journals, books, articles and newsletters
* Providing a comprehensive European information source for political scientists through its website, electronic bulletin and online searchable databases
* Promoting teaching and training and the discipline in general through the professional journal [[European Political Science]] (EPS) and summer schools.

The ECPR has close links with similar organisations, such as the [[American Political Science Association]] (APSA), European national associations and the [[International Political Science Association]] (IPSA).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5054">'''File integrity monitoring (FIM)''' is an [[internal control]] or [[process (computing)|process]] that performs the act of validating the [[integrity]] of [[operating system]] and [[application software]] [[Computer file|files]] using a verification method between the current file state and a known, good [[baseline (configuration management)|baseline]].  This comparison method often involves calculating a known cryptographic [[checksum]] of the file's original baseline and comparing with the calculated checksum of the current state of the file.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ionx.co.uk/products/verisys/how-it-works |title=  Verisys - How it Works |publisher= Ionx|accessdate=2012-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other file attributes can also be used to monitor integrity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncircle.com/index.php?s=products_ccm_file-integrity-monitoring|title=File Integrity Monitoring|publisher=nCircle|accessdate=2012-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally, the act of performing file integrity monitoring is automated using internal controls such as an application or [[process (computing)|process]]. Such monitoring can be performed [[Randomness|randomly]], at a defined [[polling (computer science)|polling]] interval, or in [[Real-time computing|real-time]].

==Security objectives==
Changes to configurations, files and file attributes across the IT infrastructure are common, but hidden within a large volume of daily changes can be the few that impact file or configuration integrity. These changes can also reduce security posture and in some cases may be leading indicators of a breach in progress. Values monitored for unexpected changes to files or configuration items include: 
* Credentials
* Privileges and Security Settings
* Content
* Core attributes and size
* Hash values
* Configuration values

==Compliance objectives==
Multiple [[Regulatory compliance|compliance objectives]] indicate file integrity monitoring as a [[requirement]].  Several examples of compliance objectives with the requirement for file integrity monitoring include:
* [[Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard|PCI-DSS - Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard]] (Requirement 11.5)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/documents/pa-dss_v2.pdf|title=Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard|publisher=PCI Security Council |accessdate= 2011-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Free City of Danzig Government in Exile''' or the '''Free State of Danzig''', is a self-declared [[government in exile]] which claims sovereignty over the territory of the defunct [[Free City of Danzig]].

== Background ==
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1996-030-01A, Danzig, Flüchtlingstreck.jpg|thumb|225px|German refugees leaving Danzig, February 1945|left]]
The Free City of Danzig ({{lang-de|Freie Stadt Danzig}}; {{lang-pl|Wolne Miasto Gdańsk}}) was a semi-[[autonomous]] [[city-state]] that existed between 1920 and 1939, consisting of the [[Baltic Sea]] port of  Danzig (now [[Gdańsk]], [[Poland]]) and nearly 200 towns in the surrounding areas. It was created on 15 November 1920&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = Danzig&amp;nbsp;– Biographie einer Stadt| url = https://books.google.com/?id=9ifeo6zdSMcC| date = February 2011| publisher = C.H.

The Free City was primarily inhabited by ethnic Germans but the majority [[Flight and expulsion of Germans from Poland during and after World War II|fled or were expelled]] when the territory was incorporated into Poland at the conclusion of [[World War II]].

== History ==
On 13 November 1947, W. Richter, the chairman of the Association of Nationals of Danzig Free State, announced the formation of a government-in-exile for the Free City of Danzig.&lt;ref name= sydney/&gt; The government made pleas to the [[United Nations]], calling for official recognition, the deportation of Poles from its claimed territory, and assistance in reestablishing the Free City.&lt;ref name= Schoenburg/&gt; Richter also announced that the association would accept a settlement from the international community that would grant them an alternative territory in a center of commerce.&lt;ref name= sydney&gt;{{cite news| date = 14 November 1947| title = Move For New Danzig Territory| url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1301&amp;dat=19471115&amp;id=CBhVAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=yZMDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2558,1793699| newspaper = [[The Sydney Morning Herald]]| location = [[London]]| access-date = 6 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The legislative body of the government in exile, the ''Rat der Danziger'' (Council of Danzig), was established that year. In 1951 and 1961, it was supposedly recognized in secret by Danzig expatriates as the "legal successor of the [[Senate]] of the Free City of Danzig."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine| date = 4 April 1967| title = An Inez denken| url = http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-45293081.html| magazine = [[Der Spiegel]]| location = [[Gdańsk]], [[Poland]]|language= German | access-date= 6 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Government ==
The Free State of Danzig government is based in [[Berlin]], [[Germany]]. It respects the original Constitution of the Free City of Danzig.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://hoheit.worldcitizenship.info/standard/downloads/deutsch/Regierungserklaerung.pdf| title = Regierungserklärung| last = von Prince| first = Beowulf | date = 17 March 2010| publisher =|language = German}}&lt;/ref&gt; The official government website is run by the incumbent Head of Foreign Affairs, Senator Ernst F. Kriesner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.danzigfreestate.org/| title = Free State of Danzig: Government-in-Exile| last = Kriesner| first = Ernst F.| website = Free State of Danzig| access-date =6 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government's legislature takes the form of a parliament, the ''Rat der Danziger'' (Council of Danzig), which has 36 members&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| editor-last = Messenger| editor-first = David A.| editor-last2 = Paehler| editor-first2 = Katrin| title = A Nazi Past: Recasting German Identity in Postwar Europe| publisher = University Press of Kentucky| date = 2015| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=CzXKBwAAQBAJ&amp;dq=| isbn = 9780813160580 | quote = [...]'Rat der Danzig,' the freely elected council of thirty-six delegates that regarded itself as the parliament of the Free City of Danzig in exile.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and claims to represent the interests of German Danzigers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Kuhn| first = Ekkehard | title = Flucht Vertreibung Integration: Über das Schicksal der Deutschen nach dem Zweiten Weltkrieg| publisher = BoD – Books on Demand| date = 2016| pages = 126| language = German| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Hw0ADAAAQBAJ&amp;dq=| isbn = 9783839136461}}&lt;/ref&gt; Members of the council are elected by Danzig expatriates and their descendants by a mailed-in ballot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Loew| first = Peter Oliver| title = Danzig: Biographie einer Stadt | publisher = C.H.Beck | date = 2011| location = [[Gdańsk]], [[Poland]]| pages = 250| language = German| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=9ifeo6zdSMcC&amp;dq=| isbn = 9783406605871}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Recognition and relations ===
A formal letter was sent to the United Nations in 1998 by Senator Kriesner requesting official recognition.&lt;ref name= application&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.danzigfreestate.org/unmembership.html| title = Application for UN Membership| last = Kriesner| first = Ernst F.| website = Free State of Danzig| access-date = 6 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing on the lack of official German recognition of the Free City of Danzig Government in Exile, [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Poland)|Polish Foreign Minister]] [[Władysław Bartoszewski]] stated that the organization and like-minded Danzig cultural associations were seen in the eyes of the German public as [[Revanchism|revanchist]] and politically aligned with the far-right [[National Democratic Party of Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last = Bartoszewski| first = Władysław| author-link = Władysław Bartoszewski| date = 7 February 2001| title = Odpowiedź ministra spraw zagranicznych na zapytanie nr 2981| language = Polish | publisher = [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Poland)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]]| publication-place = [[Warsaw, Poland]]| url = http://orka2.sejm.gov.pl/IZ3.nsf/main/748E6134| accessdate = 7 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Claims ===
The government lays claims to the entire territory once possessed by the Free City of Danzig.&lt;ref name= Schoenburg&gt;{{cite book| last = Schoenburg| first = H. W.| title = Germans from the East: A Study of Their Migration, Resettlement and Subsequent Group History, Since 1945 | publisher = Springer Science &amp; Business Media | series = Studies in Social Life| edition = illustrated| date = 2012| pages = 186| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=UVEBCAAAQBAJ&amp;dq=| isbn = 9789401032452}}&lt;/ref&gt; It bases the legitimacy of its assertion upon the notion that the Free City of Danzig was a neutral state and that its [[Reichsgau Danzig-West Prussia|annexation]] by Germany in 1939 was illegal; as such, the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] had no authority in incorporating the city into Poland after World War II.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.danzigfreestate.org/danzig-stiftung.htm| title =  Iustitia Omnibus Gedanum- Fair Justice for Danzig: Danzig People have Human Rights also!| website = Free State of Danzig| access-date = 6 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to this, no formal treaty has ever altered the status of the Free City of Danzig, and its incorporation into Poland has rested upon the general acquiescence of the international community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Capps| first = Patrick| last2 = Evans| first2 = Malcolm David| title = Asserting Jurisdiction: International and European Legal Perspectives| publisher = Hart Publishing| date = 2003| pages = 25| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=bb0VULJ8g5MC&amp;dq=| isbn = 9781841133058}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Girls of Enghelab Street''' ([[Persian language|Persian]]: دختران خیابان انقلاب) is a series of protests against [[Hijab by country#Iran|compulsory hijab]] in Iran. The protests were inspired by '''Vida Movahed''' ({{lang-fa|ویدا موحد}}), an Iranian woman known as the '''Girl of Enghelab Street''' ({{lang-fa|دختر خیابان انقلاب}}), who stood in the crowd on a utility box in the [[Enqelab Street|Enghelab Street]] (Revolution Street) of [[Tehran]] on 28 December 2017, tied her hijab, a white headscarf, to a stick, and waved it to the crowd as a flag.&lt;ref name="al-monitor.com_1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="albawaba.com_1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dailystar.com.lb_1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="foxnews.com_1"/&gt; She was arrested on that day&lt;ref name="dailystar.com.lb_1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="foxnews.com_1"/&gt; and was released temporary on bail&lt;ref name="iranhumanrights.org_1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="newyorker.com_1"/&gt; a month later, on 28 January 2018.&lt;ref name="NasrinSotoudeh_1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="independent.co.uk_1"/&gt; Some people believe that Movahed's action was based on [[Masih Alinejad]]'s call for [[White Wednesdays]], a protest movement that the presenter at [[VOA-PNN|VOA Persian Television]] started in early 2017.&lt;ref name="globalvoices.org_1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="theguardian.com_1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rferl.org_2"/&gt; Other women later re-enacted her protest and posted photos of their actions on social media. These women are described as the "Girls of Enghelab Street"&lt;ref name="theguardian.com_1"/&gt; and "The Girls Of Revolution Street"&lt;ref&gt;https://www.voanews.com/a/in-tehran-new-hijab-protester-led-off-by-police/4635838.html&lt;/ref&gt; in English sources. Some of the protesters claim that they didn't follow Masih Alinejad's call.&lt;ref name="en.radiofarda.com_2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="radiozamaneh.com_1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="radiozamaneh.com_1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="asriran.com_1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tasnimnews.com_1"/&gt;

== Islamic Republic's Penal Code ==
{{see|Theocracy#Iran}}
In the Islamic law of Iran imposed shortly after the [[Iranian Revolution|1979 Islamic revolution]], article 638 of 5th book of Islamic Penal Code (called Sanctions and deterrent penalties) women who do not wear a hijab may be imprisoned from ten days to two months, and/or required to pay fines from 50,000 up to 500,000 [[Iranian rial|rials]].&lt;ref name="thesun.co.uk_1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="article_638_iran_law"/&gt; Fines are recalculated in the courts as the value of Iranian rials drops every year since 1979.

Article 639 of the same book says, two type of people shall be sentenced to one year to 10 years imprisonment, first a person who establishes or directs a place of immorality or prostitution, second a person who facilitates or encourages people to commit immorality or prostitution.&lt;ref name="iranhumanrights.org_2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="article_639_iran_law"/&gt;

These are some of the laws under which some protesters were charged.&lt;ref name="iranhumanrights.org_2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rudaw.net_1"/&gt;

== Background ==
Before the [[Iranian Islamic Revolution]] of 1979 (during the reign of [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]], the last [[Shah]] of Iran) the hijab was not compulsory,&lt;ref name="El Guindi"/&gt; though some Iranian women during this period wore headscarfs or [[chador]].&lt;ref name="Abrahamian"/&gt;

After the 1979 Islamic revolution, the hijab gradually became compulsory.&lt;ref name="Milani"/&gt; In 1979, [[Ruhollah Khomeini]] announced that women should observe Islamic dress code;&lt;ref name="Milani"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Algar84/&gt; His statement sparked demonstrations, which were met by government assurances that the statement was only a recommendation.&lt;ref name="Milani"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Algar84/&gt; Hijab was subsequently made mandatory in government and public offices in 1980, and in 1983 it became mandatory for all women.&lt;ref name="Milani"/&gt;

In 2018, a government run survey dating back to 2014, was released by President [[Hassan Rouhani]], showing that 49.8% of Iranians were against compulsory or mandatory hijab.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com_1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="post-gazette.com_1"/&gt; The report was released by the [[Center for Strategic Studies]], the research arm of the Iranian President's office, and was titled "Report of the first hijab special meeting" on July 2014 in a PDF format.&lt;ref name="css.ir_1"/&gt;

On 2 February 2018 a poll conducted by the Center for International and Security Studies at Maryland (CISSM) showed that a few Iranians agreed with "changing Iran's political system or relaxing strict Islamic law".&lt;ref name="washingtonpost"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Taylor|first1=Adam|title=Most Iranians feel Trump’s comments in support of protesters didn’t help, poll finds|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2018/02/02/most-iranians-feel-trumps-comments-in-support-of-protesters-didnt-help-poll-finds/|website=washingtonpost|accessdate=2 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Iran is the only country in the world that requires non-Muslim women to wear a headscarf.&lt;ref name="firstpost.com_1"/&gt; For example, in January 2018, a [[Chinese people|Chinese]] female musician was forcibly veiled in the middle of her concert performance.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.albawaba.com/loop/chinese-musician-humiliated-iran-hijab-imposed-mid-performance-1074470&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Hamdan v. Rumsfeld''''', 548 U.S. 557 (2006), is a case in which the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] held that [[Guantanamo military commission|military commissions]] set up by the [[George W. Bush administration|Bush administration]] to try [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp|detainees at Guantanamo Bay]] lack "the power to proceed because its structures and procedures violate both the [[Uniform Code of Military Justice]] and the four [[Geneva Conventions]] signed in 1949."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/05pdf/05-184.pdf Hamdan v. Rumsfeld, Supreme Court Syllabus], pg. 4., point 4.&lt;/ref&gt;  Specifically, the ruling says that Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions was violated.

The case considers whether the [[United States Congress]] may pass legislation preventing the Supreme Court from hearing the case of an accused combatant before his military commission takes place, whether the special military commissions which had been set up violated federal law (including the [[Uniform Code of Military Justice]] and treaty obligations), and whether courts can enforce the articles of the Geneva Conventions.&lt;ref name="Duke"&gt;[http://www.law.duke.edu/publiclaw/supremecourtonline/certGrants/2005/hamvrum.html ''Hamdan v. Rumsfeld''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060614093747/http://www.law.duke.edu/publiclaw/supremecourtonline/certgrants/2005/hamvrum.html |date=June 14, 2006 }}, ''[[Duke University School of Law|Duke Law]]'s Supreme Court Online'', 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

An unusual aspect of the case was an [[amicus curiae|amicus brief]] filed by Senators [[Jon Kyl]] and [[Lindsey Graham]], which presented an "extensive colloquy" added to the Congressional record as evidence that "Congress was aware" that the [[McCain Detainee Amendment|Detainee Treatment Act]] of 2005 would strip the Supreme Court of jurisdiction to hear cases brought by the [[Guantanamo Bay detainment camp|Guantanamo]] detainees.  Because these statements were not included in the December 21 debate at the time, [[Emily Bazelon]] of ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' magazine has argued that their brief was an attempt to mislead the court.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slate.com/id/2138750 "Invisible Men: Did Lindsey Graham and Jon Kyl mislead the Supreme Court?"], by Emily Bazelon, ''Slate'', March 27, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 29, 2006, the Court issued a 5–3 decision holding that it had jurisdiction, and that the administration did not have authority to set up these particular military commissions without congressional authorization, because they did not comply with the Uniform Code of Military Justice and the Geneva Conventions (which the court found to be incorporated into the Uniform Code of Military Justice).&lt;ref name=AP&gt;"[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/29/washington/29cnd-scotus.html In Loss for Bush, Supreme Court Blocks War-Crimes Trials at Guantanamo]", [[Associated Press]], as reported by ''[[The New York Times]]'', June 29, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
{{main|Salim Ahmed Hamdan}}
The plaintiff was [[Salim Ahmed Hamdan]], a citizen of [[Yemen]] who worked as a bodyguard and chauffeur for [[Osama bin Laden]]. Hamdan had formerly worked in Afghanistan on an agricultural project that Bin Laden had developed. Hamdan was captured by militia forces during the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|invasion of Afghanistan]] in the fall of 2001 and turned over to the [[United States]]. In 2002, he was sent by the US to its new [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp]] at its naval base in [[Cuba]].

In July 2004, Hamdan was charged with conspiracy to commit terrorism,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.defenselink.mil/news/Jul2004/d20040714hcc.pdf Charge Sheets for Salim Ahmed Hamdan], [[United States Department of Defense]]&lt;/ref&gt; and the Bush administration made arrangements to try him before a [[Guantanamo military commission|military commission]], established by the Department of Defense under [[Military Commission Order No. 1]] of March 21, 2002. He was assigned a defense counsel, LCDR [[Charles D. Swift]] from the Navy JAG, who with a legal team filed a petition for Hamdan in US District Court for a [[writ of habeas corpus]], challenging the constitutionality of the military commission, and saying that it lacked the protections required under the [[Geneva Conventions]] and United States [[Uniform Code of Military Justice]].

Following the United States Supreme Court ruling in ''[[Hamdi v. Rumsfeld]]'' (2004), which established that detainees had the right of ''habeas corpus'' to challenge their detention, Hamdan was granted a review before the [[Combatant Status Review Tribunal]]. It determined that he was eligible for detention by the United States as an [[enemy combatant]] or person of interest.&lt;ref name="Duke"/&gt;

The defendants in this case included many [[United States]] government officials allegedly responsible for Hamdan's detention; the short name of the case includes only the first-named defendant, then-[[Secretary of Defense]] [[Donald Rumsfeld]].

==District and Appeals Court rulings==
After reviewing Hamdan's habeas petition, Judge [[James Robertson (judge)|James Robertson]] of the [[United States District Court for the District of Columbia]] ruled in the detainee's favor. He found that the United States could not hold a military commission unless it was first shown that the detainee was not a [[prisoner of war]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/news/Global-Terrorism/Osamas-driver-outmanoeuvres-terror-trials/2004/11/09/1099781361307.html Bin Laden's driver outmanoeuvres Guantanamo trials], ''[[Sydney Morning Herald]]'', November 9, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wlf.org/upload/110904RS.pdf Court bars efforts to try terrorist before military commissions], ''[[Washington Legal Foundation]]'', November 9, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/politics/wire/sns-ap-scotus-terror-suspects,1,722524.story?coll=sns-ap-politics-headlines High Court Sidesteps Guantanamo Bay Case], ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', January 19, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 15, 2005, a [[United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit]] three-judge panel: [[A. Raymond Randolph]], [[John Roberts]] and [[Stephen F. Williams]], unanimously reversed the decision of the District Court.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pacer.cadc.uscourts.gov/docs/common/opinions/200507/04-5393a.pdf ''Hamdan v. Rumsfeld''], [[United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit]], July 18, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Judge Randolph, who wrote the decision, cited the following reasons for the legality of the military commission:
# Military commissions are legitimate forums to try [[Combatant|enemy combatants]] because they have been approved by [[United States Congress|Congress]].
# The Geneva Convention is a treaty between nations and as such it does not confer individual rights and remedies.
# Even if the Geneva Convention could be enforced in U.S. courts, it would not be of assistance to Hamdan at the time because the war against [[al-Qaeda]] was not between two countries, and the Convention guarantees only a certain standard of judicial procedure—a "competent tribunal"—without speaking to the jurisdiction in which the prisoner must be tried.
# Under the terms of the Geneva Convention, al Qaeda and its members are not covered.
# Congress authorized such activity by [[statute]].
# The judicial branch of the United States government cannot enforce the Convention, thus invalidating Hamdan's argument that he cannot be tried until after his prisoner-of-war status is determined.&lt;ref name="Duke"/&gt;

==Supreme Court decision==
On November 7, 2005, the Supreme Court issued a [[certiorari|writ of certiorari]] to hear the case.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2005/11/breaking-news-supreme-court-to-hear.php "Supreme Court to hear challenge to Gitmo tribunals"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060418142018/http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2005/11/breaking-news-supreme-court-to-hear.php |date=April 18, 2006 }}, ''Jurist, University of Pittsburgh School of Law'', November 7, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The petition was filed on behalf of Hamdan by [[Neal Katyal]] of [[Georgetown University Law Center]] and Lt. Commander [[Charles Swift]] of the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]], an alumnus of [[Seattle University]] School of Law. The Seattle law firm [[Perkins Coie]] provided the additional legal counsel for Hamdan.

The case was argued before the court on March 28, 2006. Katyal argued on behalf of Hamdan, and [[Paul Clement]], the [[United States Solicitor General|Solicitor General of the United States]], argued on behalf of the government.&lt;ref&gt;[http://docket.medill.northwestern.edu/archives/003208.php Hamdan, Salim v. Rumsfeld, Donald (Secy. of Defense)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060331044835/http://docket.medill.northwestern.edu/archives/003208.php |date=March 31, 2006 }} Medill, Northwestern University, November 11, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Roberts|Chief Justice Roberts]] recused himself because he had previously ruled on this case as part of the three judge panel on the [[United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit]]. Critics called for Justice [[Antonin Scalia]] to recuse himself, since he had made allegedly improper comments about the decision of the case prior to hearing oral arguments ("I'm not about to give this man who was captured in a war a full jury trial. I mean it's crazy")&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2006-03-26-scalia-guantanamo_x.htm ''USA Today''] (AP) March 26, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; but he chose not to do so.

The Supreme Court announced its decision on June 29, 2006. The Court reversed the ruling of the Court of Appeals, holding that President George W. Bush did not have authority to set up the war crimes tribunals and finding the special military commissions illegal under both military justice law and the Geneva Conventions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/5129904.stm|title=US court rejects Guantanamo trial|publisher=BBC News | date=June 29, 2006 | accessdate=January 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SCOTUS"&gt;{{cite web | title= ''Hamdan v.

===Stevens' opinion for the Court===
[[File:John Paul Stevens, SCOTUS photo portrait.jpg|150px|thumb|Justice Stevens, the author of the Court's opinion.]]
[[Associate Justice]] [[John Paul Stevens]] wrote [https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/05-184.ZO.html the opinion for the Court], which commanded a majority only in part.

The Stevens opinion began with the issue of [[jurisdiction]], denying the U.S. government's [[motion to dismiss]] under Section 1005 of the [[Detainee Treatment Act|Detainee Treatment Act of 2005]] (DTA), which gave the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals "exclusive" jurisdiction to review decisions of cases being tried before military commissions. Congress did not include language in the DTA that might have precluded Supreme Court jurisdiction, making the government's argument to the Court unpersuasive. The government's argument that ''[[Schlesinger v. Councilman]]'' 420 U.S. 738 (1975) precludes Supreme Court review was similarly rejected. ''Councilman'' applied to a member of the U.S. military who was being tried before a military "[[Courts-martial in the United States|court-martial]]". In contrast, Hamdan is not a member of the U.S. military, and would be tried before a military "commission", not a court-martial. To the court, the more persuasive precedent was ''[[Ex parte Quirin]]'', in which the court recognized its duty to enforce relevant Constitutional protections by convening a special Term and expediting review of a trial by military convention. The opinion explicitly stated that, because DTA did not bar it from considering the petition, it was unnecessary to decide whether laws unconditionally barring habeas corpus petitions would unconstitutionally violate the [[Suspension Clause]].

The opinion then addressed the substantive issues of the case. It explicitly did not decide whether the President possessed the Constitutional power to convene military commissions like the one created to try Hamdan. Even if he possessed such power, those tribunals would either have to be sanctioned by the "laws of war", as codified by Congress in Article 21 of the [[Uniform Code of Military Justice]] (UCMJ), or authorized by statute. As to the statutory authorization, there is nothing in the [[Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists|Authorization for Use of Military Force]] (AUMF) "even hinting" at expanding the President's war powers beyond those enumerated in Art. 21. Instead, the AUMF, the UCMJ, and the DTA "at most acknowledge" the President's authority to convene military commissions only where justified by the exigencies of war, but still operating within the laws of war.

As to the [[laws of war]], to the majority these necessarily include the UCMJ and the [[Geneva Conventions]], each of which require more protections than the military commission provides. The UCMJ, Art. 36 (b), requires that rules applied in courts-martial and military commissions be "uniform insofar as practicable".  Stevens found several substantial deviations, including:
* The defendant and the defendant's attorney may be forbidden to view certain evidence used against the defendant; the defendant's attorney may be forbidden to discuss certain evidence with the defendant;
* Evidence judged to have any probative value may be admitted, including [[hearsay]], unsworn live testimony, and statements gathered through torture; and
* Appeals are not heard by courts, but only within the Executive Branch (with an exception not here relevant).

These deviations made the commissions violate the UCMJ.

The majority also found that the procedures in question violate the "at least" applicable Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions. It found that the D.C. Court of Appeals erred in concluding that the Conventions did not apply:
# It erroneously relied on ''[[Johnson v. Eisentrager]]'', which does not legally control in Hamdan's case because there was then no deviation between the procedures used in the tribunal and those used in courts-martial;
# It erroneously ruled that the Geneva Conventions do not apply because Art. 3 affords minimal protection to combatants "in the territory of" a signatory; and
# Those minimal protections include being tried by a "regularly constituted court", which the military commission is not.
Because the military commission does not meet the requirements of the Uniform Code of Military Justice or of the Geneva Convention, it violates the laws of war and therefore cannot be used to try Hamdan.

The Court did not hear the question that had decided the district court opinion, namely that Hamdan was entitled to a GCIII Art. 5 hearing instead of a [[Combatant Status Review Tribunal]].

{{quote|Hamdan observes that Article 5 of the Third Geneva Convention requires that if there be "any doubt" whether he is entitled to prisoner-of-war protections, he must be afforded those protections until his status is determined by a "competent tribunal". Because we hold that Hamdan may not, in any event, be tried by the military commission the President has convened pursuant to the November 13 Order and Commission Order No. 1, the question whether his potential status as a prisoner of war independently renders illegal his trial by military commission may be reserved.&lt;ref&gt;''Hamdan v. Rumsfeld'', p. 66, note 61.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Plurality sections====
Because Justice [[Anthony Kennedy]] did not join Stevens' opinion as to several parts, largely on the grounds of judicial [[Occam's razor|parsimony]] (that is, having decided that the military commissions had no foundation, the core question of the case was decided and the Court did not need to go further), those sections were without a majority in support.

In one of these sections, Stevens addressed the issue of whether military commissions can try conspiracy charges. He argued that military commissions are not courts of general jurisdiction, which are able to try any crime; that the court has traditionally held that offenses against the law of war are triable by military commission only when they are clearly defined as war crimes by statute or strong [[common law]] precedent (cf. ''Quirin''). Finally, he found that there was no support in statute or court precedent for law-of-war military commissions trying charges of "[[Conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy]]", either in the Geneva Conventions, in the earlier [[Hague Conventions (1899 and 1907)|Hague Conventions]] or at the [[Nuremberg Trials]].

====Addressing the dissents====
As is common in opinions to which there are dissents, Stevens' opinion addressed the major arguments in dissent. For example:
* The majority opinion says that Justice Scalia's argument concerning the jurisdiction-stripping statute (section 1005e(1)) ignores the effective date provision of that very statute (section 1005(h)).
* The majority opinion says that the government's contention that the war started on September 11, 2001, undercuts Justice Thomas' argument that it started in 1996.
* The majority opinion notes that language in the [[Congressional Record]] that the Scalia dissent cites was inserted into the Record ''after'' the legislation had been enacted, by Senators [[Lindsey Graham]] (R-SC) and [[Jon Kyl]] (R-AZ), and includes falsified quotations attributed to other persons.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.slate.com/id/2144780/ Not Live From Capitol Hill]", slate.com, by Emily Bazelon, June 29, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Breyer's concurrence===
[[Stephen Breyer|Justice Breyer]] wrote [https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/05-184.ZC.html a one-page concurring opinion], joined by Justices Kennedy, Souter, and Ginsburg.&lt;ref&gt;126 S. Ct. at 2799.&lt;/ref&gt; Breyer contended that the commissions are not necessarily categorically prohibited, as long as Congress approves them:

{{quote|Congress has denied the President the legislative authority to create military commissions of the kind at issue here. Nothing prevents the President from returning to Congress to seek the authority he believes necessary. ... Where, as here, no emergency prevents consultation with Congress, judicial insistence upon that consultation does not weaken our Nation's ability to deal with danger. To the contrary, that insistence strengthens the Nation's ability to determine—through democratic means—how best to do so. The Constitution places its faith in those democratic means. Our Court today simply does the same.&lt;ref&gt;Mahler, Jonathan (2008). ''The Challenge: Hamdan v. Rumsfeld and the Fight Over Presidential Power''. New York: Farrar, Straus and Giroux, p. 300. {{ISBN|978-0-374-22320-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Kennedy's concurrence===
[[File:Anthony Kennedy Official.jpg|150px|thumb|Justice Kennedy]]
[[Anthony Kennedy|Justice Kennedy]] wrote [https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/05-184.ZC1.html an opinion concurring in part], joined as to parts I and II by Justices Souter, Ginsburg, and Breyer.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;u&gt;Id.&lt;/u&gt; at 2799–2809.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Part One of Kennedy's concurrence, he raises his concern for the separation of powers; specifically, how one branch can control all the elements of a case, including avenues of review and appeal.

Part Two describes the differences between the procedures of the military commissions and the procedures prescribed by the UCMJ (fewer jury members, different rules of evidence, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;''Id.'' at 2804.&lt;/ref&gt;  These differences demonstrate that the commissions do not operate under the rules of military courts-martial, and raise issues of neutrality with respect to the military judges involved. The negation of fairness safeguards renders the commission a judicial entity which is not a "regularly constituted court", as required in the Geneva Convention. In sum, Kennedy writes that the commission exceeds congressional bounds, though the Congress is free to re-write the law as they see fit.

The third and final Part lists some of Kennedy's reservations.&lt;ref&gt;''Id.'' at 2808.&lt;/ref&gt; He would not say that the defendant must be present at all stages of the trial. There should be a reluctance to consider the applicability of Article 75 of Protocol I, since the U.S. never signed it and thus it is not binding. Kennedy writes that he feels it was not necessary to delve into the validity of the conspiracy charge, and he expresses no view on the merits of the other limitations of the commission noted in Part V of the Decision.

===Scalia's dissent===
Justice Scalia wrote [https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/05-184.ZD.html a dissenting opinion] that focuses primarily on issues of jurisdiction, and was joined by Justices Thomas and Alito.&lt;ref&gt;''Id.'' at 2810–2823.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scalia calls the Court's conclusion to hear the case "patently erroneous". His first argument relies on the part of the [[Detainee Treatment Act]] (DTA) (effective December 30, 2005) that states "[N]o court, justice, or judge shall have jurisdiction to hear or consider an application for a writ of habeas corpus filed by or on behalf of an alien detained by the Department of Defense at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba." §1005(e)(1), 119 Stat. 2742. Scalia's opinion is that this clause suffices to deny the Supreme Court jurisdiction over the case, calling the majority's reading  of the effectiveness provisions of §1005(h), a "mess". He cites ''[[Bruner v. United States]]'' and other cases granting "immediate effect in pending cases, absent an explicit statutory reservation". He wrote that in interpreting the language in the DTA, the majority ignored Supreme Court precedents which established that a statute excluding jurisdiction applies to pending cases unless it has clear language saying it does not. Scalia claimed that the majority had made this interpretation "for the flimsiest of reasons".&lt;ref&gt;Mahler, Jonathan (2008). ''The Challenge: Hamdan v. Rumsfeld and the Fight Over Presidential Power''. New York: Farrar, Straus and Giroux, p. 285. {{ISBN|978-0-374-22320-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was referring to the majority's use of Senate floor debate records to bolster their interpretation, writing that it "makes no difference" that the language in support of his position was inserted into the Congressional Record after the law was voted upon. He also accuses the majority of ignoring the President's [[Signing Statement]].

Furthermore, he anticipates that expanding the jurisdictions able to hear writs of habeas corpus from Guantanamo Bay would create excessive load on the court system.

In addition, Scalia states that the original military tribunal was not shown to be inadequate. Regarding the application of the [[Suspension Clause]] of the Constitution, Scalia points to ''[[Johnson v. Eisentrager]]''.

In its second major argument, Scalia's opinion argues that petitioners such as Hamdan held outside the territorial jurisdiction of the United States lack the right to the writ of ''[[habeas corpus]]''.  He points in a footnote to ''[[Hamdi v. Rumsfeld]]'', under which he claims Hamdan "is already subject to indefinite detention" "after an adverse determination by his [[CSRT]]".

Finally, Justice Scalia chastises the Court for taking [[Equity (law)|equity]] jurisdiction of the case and draws an analogy with ''[[Schlesinger v. Councilman]]'', 420 U.S. 738 (1975). In that case, the Supreme Court declined passing judgment on the decision of a military [[court-martial]] before it finished its work; Scalia argues that likewise, the military [[tribunal|commissions]] in Cuba have not yet ended their work regarding Hamdan and therefore should not be subject to judicial oversight.&lt;ref name="SCOTUS"/&gt;

===Thomas's dissent===
Justice [[Clarence Thomas]] read [https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/05-184.ZD1.html his dissent] from the bench when the decision was announced, the first time he did so since his dissent in ''[[Stenberg v. Carhart]]'', 530 U.S. 914 (2000).

In his dissent he asserted that the courts had no jurisdiction for this case for the reasons described in Scalia's dissent above; that Hamdan is an [[illegal combatant]] and therefore not protected by the [[Geneva convention]]; that the Geneva convention does not prohibit the special court council proposed; and that the President already had authority to set up the special court council proposed.&lt;ref&gt;126 S. Ct. at 2823–49.&lt;/ref&gt;

Citing his dissent in ''[[Hamdi v. Rumsfeld]]'', Thomas briefly reprised the roles granted by the Constitution to the three different branches in time of war. He argued that under the framework established in ''[[Ex parte Quirin]]'' and ''[[Youngstown Sheet &amp; Tube Co. v. Sawyer]]'', President Bush's decision to try Hamdan before a military commission "is entitled to a heavy measure of deference", inasmuch as Congress had authorized the President to use all necessary and appropriate force to prevent future acts of terrorism when it passed the [[Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists|Authorization for Use of Military Force]].

Thomas disagreed strongly with the plurality's determination that the legality of the charges against Hamdan are doubtful because he was charged "not with an [[overt act]] for which he was caught redhanded ... but with an 'agreement' the inception of which long predated ... the [relevant armed conflict]". He lambasted the plurality for second-guessing the Executive's judgment, arguing that the Court's disagreement was based upon "little more than its unsupported assertions" and constituted "an unprecedented departure from the traditionally limited role of the courts with respect to war and an unwarranted intrusion on executive authority". Thomas further disagreed with the plurality's assumption that the date of the enactment of the AUMF constituted the start of war, suggesting that [[Osama bin Laden|Osama bin Laden's]] declaration of [[jihad]] in August 1996 could be considered a declaration of war. Under this view, the enactment by Congress of the AUMF did not mark the beginning of the conflict with [[al Qaeda]], but rather authorized the Executive to use force to combat it. Additionally, Thomas wrote that under the common law of war, which is "flexible and evolutionary in nature", war courts are permitted a degree of latitude in their jurisdiction. In holding otherwise, the plurality failed to properly defer to the judgment of the Executive and military commanders.

Referring to the Court's recent decision in ''[[Rapanos v. United States]]'', Thomas noted with some incredulity that while the Justices in the instant decision "disregard[ed] the commander-in-chief's wartime decisions", they had no trouble deferring to the judgment of the Corps of Engineers in upholding the agency's "wildly implausible conclusion that a storm drain is a tributary of the waters of the United States". He added that "It goes without saying that there is much more at stake here than storm drains."

Thomas likewise disagreed with the plurality's holding that even if the government had charged Hamdan with a crime that was clearly cognizable by military commission, the commission would still lack power to proceed because it does not comply with the terms of the UCMJ and the four Geneva Conventions signed in 1949. He again emphasized that the jurisdiction of military commissions is not prescribed by statute but is rather "adapted in each instance to the need that called it forth". Thomas argued that the Court's conclusion that Article 36 of the UCMJ amounts to an attempt by Congress to curb the Executive's power is "contrary to the text and structure of the UCMJ" and also inconsistent with prior decisions of the Court. Addressing Hamdan's claims under the Geneva Convention, Thomas argued that these are foreclosed by the Court's holding in ''[[Johnson v. Eisentrager]]'', where the majority noted that the respondents could not assert "that anything in the Geneva Convention makes them immune from prosecution or punishment for war crimes". Further, even if Hamdan's claim under Common Article 3 was not foreclosed by ''Eisentrager'', it is nevertheless meritless insofar as the President has accepted the determination of the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] that Common Article 3 of Geneva does not extend to al Qaeda detainees. Thomas asserted that the Court's duty in this instance to "defer to the President's understanding of the provision at issue" is made even more acute by the fact that he is acting pursuant to his authority as Commander-in-Chief.

===Alito's dissent===
In [https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/05-184.ZD2.html a seven page dissent], Alito sided with Thomas and Scalia's explanation of why they believe the courts had no jurisdiction for this case.&lt;ref&gt;''Id.'' at 2849–55.&lt;/ref&gt; He explained why he believed the military commission in this case was legal. Alito disagreed with the holding of the Court which found that military commissions did not meet the definition of "a regularly constituted court" as required in Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions. Alito argued that Common Article 3 was satisfied in ''Hamdan'' because the military commissions:
# qualify as courts,
# were appointed and established in accordance with domestic law, and
# any procedural improprieties that might occur in particular cases can be reviewed in those cases.

Alito specifically disagreed with the opinions supporting the judgment which held that the military commission before which Hamdan would be tried is not "a regularly constituted court", and that the military commission is "illegal", because the commission's procedures allegedly would not comply with {{USC|10|836}}. Alito wrote that the military commission was "regularly" or "properly" constituted, using the example of the various types of local, state, federal and international courts and how "although these courts are 'differently constituted' and differ substantially in many other respects, they are all 'regularly constituted.'"

Alito stated that Geneva Convention Common Article 3 does not specifically rule out military commissions, and further points to the commentary in Article 66, which was the article the Court used in support of its opinion.  Alito argued that even if Common Article 3 recognizes a prohibition on "special tribunals", which Article 66 does prohibit, such a prohibition is not applicable to Hamdan's tribunal because the military commissions were "regular".&lt;ref&gt;Citing ''[[Webster's Third New International Dictionary]]'', Alito relied on the definition of "special", "relating to a single thing"; and the definition of "regular", "uniform in course, practice, or occurrence".&lt;/ref&gt; Further, because the Bush Administration might conduct the hundreds of such tribunals according to the same procedures, Alito concluded that "it seems that petitioner's tribunal, like the hundreds of others respondents propose to conduct, is very much regular and not at all special."

Alito wrote that "the commissions were appointed, set up, and established pursuant to an order of the President, just like the commission in ''[[Ex parte Quirin]]'', 317 U. S. 1 (1942), and the Court acknowledges that ''Quirin'' recognized that the statutory predecessor of {{USC|10|821}} 'preserved' the President's power 'to convene military commissions.'" Alito disagreed with Kennedy's assertion that "an acceptable degree of independence from the Executive is necessary to render a commission 'regularly constituted' by the standards of our Nation's system of justice", arguing that Kennedy "offers no support for this proposition (which in any event seems to be more about fairness or integrity than regularity)", and further arguing that the commission in ''Quirin'' was no different from the present case.

Finally, Alito wrote that the commission procedures as a whole do not provide a basis for deeming the commissions to be illegitimate.  He points to two procedural rules, which the Court found fault with: First, the rule "allowing the Secretary of Defense to change the governing rules 'from time to time{{'"}}; and second, the rule that "permits the admission of any evidence that would have 'probative value to a reasonable person{{'"}}.  Alito asserts these rules cannot make the commissions illegitimate.

On the first rule Alito argued that not all changes during the course of a trial [[prejudice]] the defendant, and that some may even help the defendant. In addition, "If a change is made and applied during the course of an ongoing proceeding and if the accused is found guilty, the validity of that procedure can be considered in the review proceeding for that case."

On the second rule, Alito argued that this rule does not violate the international standard incorporated into Common Article 3, because "[[rules of evidence]] differ from country to country" and "much of the world does not follow aspects of our evidence rules, such as the general prohibition against the admission of hearsay".

==Reaction to the decision==
The impact of the decision on the petitioner (Hamdan) was that he can still be tried; however, his trial must be in a court, such as a military court-martial, or possibly a commission that has court-like protections.

Shortly thereafter, the [[Military Commissions Act of 2006]] may have raised again the issue of which court would hear cases such as Hamdan's. The [[United States Department of Justice|U.S. Department of Justice]] has filed notice with several federal judges, and given notice to hundreds of detainees, that the [[Writ of Habeas Corpus|habeas petitions]] of alien unlawful enemy combatants (or those whose status is to be determined) are not within the jurisdiction of those courts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boston.com/news/nation/washington/articles/2006/10/20/terror_law_renders_detainee_cases_moot?mode=PF US: Courts No Longer Open to Detainees], October 20, 2006, Matt Apuzzo, Associated Press Writer, retrieved October 20, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

The passage and signing of the [[Military Commissions Act of 2006|Act]] follows through on President Bush's expressed intention to get explicit Congressional authorization to use military tribunals.&lt;ref&gt;[https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2006/06/print/20060629-3.html President Bush and Japanese Prime Minister Koizumi Participate in a Joint Press Availability], June 29, 2006, White House Archives.&lt;/ref&gt; Press Secretary [[Tony Snow]] echoed the plan to appeal to Congress.&lt;ref&gt;[https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2006/06/print/20060630-5.html Press Gaggle by Tony Snow], June 30, 2006, White House Archives.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, even among Senate Republicans, there were conflicting views. Senators [[Arlen Specter]] and [[Lindsey Graham]] (the latter a former [[Judge Advocate General's Corps|military prosecutor]]) indicated Congress would work quickly to authorize tribunals, while influential Senator [[John Warner]] suggested a cautious and deliberative response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Kate |last=Zernike |title=Warner Is Uncertain on Legislation for Tribunals |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/01/us/01gitmo.html |work=New York Times |date=July 1, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The potential for Congressional action also provided an avenue for politicking, as Republicans threatened Democratic members of Congress with being labeled weak on terrorism if they did not authorize tribunals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Michael |last=Abramowitz |author2=Weisman, Jonathan |title=GOP Seeks Advantage In Ruling On Trials |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/06/30/AR2006063001737.html |work=Washington Post |date=July 1, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 7, 2006, the [[Secretary of Defense]] issued a memo "Application of Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions to the Treatment of Detainees in the Department of Defense".&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.slate.com/id/2145592 Geneva-22] on slate.com, from Timothy Noah, July 11, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; This may be the basis of a July 11, 2006, statement by the Bush administration that all detainees at Guantanamo Bay and in U.S. military custody everywhere are entitled to humane treatment under the Geneva Conventions.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.truthout.org/cgi-bin/artman/exec/view.cgi/62/21075 U.S. will give detainees Geneva rights] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070913090752/http://www.truthout.org/cgi-bin/artman/exec/view.cgi/62/21075 |date=September 13, 2007 }}", by Anne Plummer Flaherty, AP.&lt;/ref&gt;  This declaration appears not to cover [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] detainees and is ambiguous with respect to the interpretation of Common Article 3 and the definition of "humane treatment".&lt;ref&gt;[http://balkin.blogspot.com/2006/07/newsflash-pentagon-agrees-to-abide-by.html Newsflash: Pentagon Agrees to Abide by Supreme Court Ruling – Or Does It?] Marty Lederman, July 11, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

There were some indications that the other detainees being held at facilities throughout the world (e.g., [[Bagram Air Base]] and [[black sites]]), might use the Supreme Court's ruling to challenge their treatment. Their reasoning may be that since the Geneva Conventions afforded protection to Hamdan, its other protections might be effective for them as well. Commentators expressed mixed opinions about the strength of this argument.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Neil A. |last=Lewis |title=Detainees May Test Reach of Guantánamo Ruling |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/01/us/01geneva.html |work=New York Times |date=July 1, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Implications for theories of executive power===

The decision may have important implications for other disputes relating to the extent of executive power and the [[unitary executive theory]]. In particular, it may undermine the Bush administration's [[NSA warrantless surveillance controversy|legal arguments]] for [[NSA electronic surveillance program|domestic wiretapping]] by the [[National Security Agency]] without warrants as required by the [[Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act]].&lt;ref name=GG&gt;[http://www.crooksandliars.com/2006/07/09/supreme-courts-ruling-in-hamdan-means-warrantless-eavesdropping-is-clearly-illegal/ Supreme Court's Ruling in Hamdan Means Warrantless Eavesdropping is Clearly Illegal] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081122004249/http://www.crooksandliars.com/2006/07/09/supreme-courts-ruling-in-hamdan-means-warrantless-eavesdropping-is-clearly-illegal/ |date=November 22, 2008 }}, [[Glenn Greenwald]], July 9, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Charges dismissed/new charges===
On June 5, 2007, Hamdan and [[Canada|Canadian]] youth [[Omar Khadr]], had all charges against them dismissed.&lt;ref name=MiamiHerald20070604&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.miamiherald.com/news/americas/cuba/story/36587.html|title=Military panels hear captives' side of story|work=[[Miami Herald]]|author=[[Carol Rosenberg]]|date=June 4, 2007|accessdate=June 4, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Sheldon |last=Alberts |title=Khadr remains in detention after all charges dropped |url=http://www.canada.com/nationalpost/story.html?id=ead5bb60-723b-4f87-a2fe-2dbe0845d8f2 |work=[[National Post]] |publisher=[[CanWest Global Communications|Canwest MediaWorksPublications Inc.]] |date=June 4, 2007 |accessdate=June 4, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070606085036/http://www.canada.com/nationalpost/story.html?id=ead5bb60-723b-4f87-a2fe-2dbe0845d8f2 |archivedate=June 6, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Wapo20070607&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/06/06/AR2007060602302.html|title=Stuck in Guantanamo: President Bush tried to create a new legal system for terrorism suspects. He created a quagmire instead.|date=June 7, 2007|work=[[Washington Post]]|accessdate=June 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The judges presiding over their military commissions ruled that the Military Commissions Act did not give them the jurisdiction to try Hamdan and Khadr, because it only authorized the trial of "[[unlawful enemy combatants]]". Hamdan and Khadr's Combatant Status Review Tribunals, like those of all the other Guantanamo captives, had confirmed them as "enemy combatants".

In December 2007, a tribunal determined that Hamdan was an "unlawful enemy combatant". In August 2008, he was convicted by the military commission of the lesser of two charges and received a sentence of 66 months, reduced by time served to five and a half months. In November 2008, the US transferred him to Yemen, where he served his last month. After release, he joined his family in Sana. In October 2012, the US Appeals Court for the District of Columbia, overturned Hamdan's conviction, acquitting him of the charge&lt;ref&gt;''The Eyes of the World: Charges, Challenges, and Guantánamo Military Commissions After Hamdan II'', by: Frohock, Christina M., National Security &amp; Armed Conflict Law Review, 2015, Vol. 6, p1-24.&lt;/ref&gt;.

[[File:Hyponym and hypernym.svg|thumb|300px| An example of the relationship between hyponyms and hypernym]]
{{Use British English|date=January 2014}}

In [[linguistics]], a '''hyponym''' (from Greek ''hupó'', "under" and ''ónoma'', "name") is a [[word]] or [[phrase]] whose [[semantic field]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brinton |first=Laurel J. |year=2000 &lt;!--NO_PREVIEW: |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Cqhef3mfhXQC--&gt; |title=The Structure of Modern English: A Linguistic Introduction |edition=Illustrated |publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company |isbn=978-90-272-2567-2 |page=112}}&lt;/ref&gt; is included within that of another word, its '''hyperonym''' or '''hypernym''' (from Greek ''hupér'', "over" and ''ónoma'', "name").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Stede |first=Manfred |title=The hyperonym problem revisited: Conceptual and lexical hierarchies in language generation - W00-1413 |url=http://aclweb.org/anthology//W/W00/W00-1413.pdf |publisher=Association for Computational Linguistics |accessdate=5 January 2014 |pages=93–99 |format=PDF |doi=10.3115/1118253.1118267 |date=June 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; In simpler terms, a hyponym is in a [[ontology components|''type-of'' relationship]] with its hypernym. For example, ''pigeon'', ''crow'', ''eagle'' and ''seagull'' are all hyponyms of ''[[bird]]'' (their hypernym); which, in turn, is a hyponym of ''[[animal]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Victoria |last=Fromkin |last2=Robert |first2=Rodman |title=Introduction to Language |isbn=0-03-018682-X |year=1998 |publisher=Harcourt Brace College Publishers |location=Fort Worth |edition=6th}}{{page needed|date=January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hyponyms and hypernyms ==
Hyponymy shows the relationship between a generic term (hypernym) and a specific instance of it (hyponym). A hyponym is a word or phrase whose semantic field is more specific than its hypernym. The semantic field of a hypernym, also known as a superordinate, is broader than that of a hyponym. An approach to the relationship between hyponyms and hypernyms is to view a hypernym as consisting of hyponyms. This, however, becomes more difficult with abstract words such as ''imagine'', ''understand'' and ''knowledge''. While hyponyms are typically used to refer to nouns, it can also be used on other parts of speech.  Like nouns, hypernyms in verbs are words that refer to a broad category of actions. For example, verbs such as ''stare'', ''gaze'', ''view'' and ''peer'' can also be considered hyponyms of the verb ''look'', which is their hypernym.

Hypernyms and hyponyms are asymmetric. Hyponymy can be tested by substituting X and Y in the sentence ‘X is a kind of Y’ and determining if it makes sense.&lt;ref name=Maienborn&gt;{{cite book|first=Claudia|last=Maienborn |last2=von Heusinger |first2=Klaus |last3=Portner |first3=Paul (eds.) |title=Semantics: An International Handbook of Natural Language Meaning. |isbn=978-3-11-018470-9 |year=2011 |publisher=De Gruyter Mouton |location=Berlin}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, ‘A screwdriver is a kind of tool’ makes sense but not ‘A tool is a kind of screwdriver’.

Strictly speaking, the meaning relation between hyponyms and hypernyms applies  to lexical items of the same word class (or parts of speech), and holds between [[Word_sense|senses]] rather than words. For instance, the word ''screwdriver'' used in the previous example refers to [[Screwdriver|the tool for turning a screw]], and not to [[Screwdriver (cocktail)|the drink made with vodka and orange juice]].

Hyponymy is a [[transitive relation]], if X is a hyponym of Y, and Y is a hyponym of Z, then X is a hyponym of Z.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=John|last=Lyons |title=Semantics |isbn=978-0-52-129165-1 |year=1977 |publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, ''violet'' is a hyponym of ''purple'' and ''purple'' is a hyponym of ''color''; therefore ''violet'' is a hyponym of ''color''. A word can be both a hypernym and a hyponym: for example ''purple'' is a hyponym of colour but itself is a hypernym of the broad spectrum of shades of purple between the range of ''crimson'' and ''violet''.

The hierarchical structure of semantic fields can be mostly seen in hyponymy. They could be observed from top to bottom, where the higher level is more general and the lower level is more specific. For example, ''living things'' will be the highest level followed by ''plants'' and ''animals'', and the lowest level may comprise ''dog'', ''cat'' and ''wolf''.&lt;ref name="The Application of Semantic Field Theory to English Vocabulary Learning"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gao|first1=Chunming|last2=Xu|first2=Bin|title=The Application of Semantic Field Theory to English Vocabulary Learning|journal=Theory and Practice in Language studies|date=November 2013|volume=3|issue=11|pages=2030–2035|url=http://ojs.academypublisher.com/index.php/tpls/article/viewFile/tpls031120302035/8042|accessdate=6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the relations of hyponymy and incompatibility, taxonomic hierarchical structures too can be formed. It consists of two relations; the first one being exemplified in 'An X is a Y' (simple hyponymy) while the second relation is 'An X is a kind/type of Y'. The second relation is said to be more discriminating and can be classified more specifically under the concept of taxonomy.&lt;ref name="The Semantics of Relationships: An Interdisciplinary Perspective"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Green|first1=Rebecca|last2=Bean|first2=Carol A.|last3=Sung|first3=Hyon Myaeng|title=The Semantics of Relationships: An Interdisciplinary Perspective|date=2002|publisher=Kluwer Academic Publishers|location=Netherlands|page=12|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JgplkZbZ2zwC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA3#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=2014-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Co-hyponyms===
If the hypernym Z consists of hyponyms X and Y, X and Y are identified as co-hyponyms. Co-hyponyms are labelled as such when separate hyponyms share the same hypernym but are not hyponyms of one another, unless they happen to be synonymous.&lt;ref name=Maienborn /&gt; For example, ''screwdriver'', ''scissors'', ''knife'', and ''hammer'' are all co-hyponyms of one another and hyponyms of ''tool'', but not hyponyms of one another: *‘A hammer is a type of knife’ is false.

Co-hyponyms are often but not always related to one another by the relation of incompatibility. For example, ''apple'', ''peach'' and ''plum'' are co-hyponyms of ''fruit''. However, an ''apple'' is not a ''peach'', which is also not a ''plum''. Thus, they are incompatible. Nevertheless, co-hyponyms are not necessarily incompatible in all senses. A ''queen'' and ''mother'' are both hyponyms of ''woman'' but there is nothing preventing the ''queen'' from being a ''mother''.&lt;ref name="Meaning in Language"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cruse|first1=D. A.|title=Meaning in Language: An Introduction to Semantics and Pragmatics|date=2004|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=162|edition=2|url=http://www.personal.uni-jena.de/~mu65qev/wikolin/images/d/d0/Cruse_ch9.pdf|dead-url=yes|accessdate=2014-10-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141017101534/http://www.personal.uni-jena.de/~mu65qev/wikolin/images/d/d0/Cruse_ch9.pdf|archive-date=2014-10-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This shows that compatibility may be relevant.

== Usage ==
[[Computer science]] often terms this relationship an "[[is-a]]" relationship. For example, the phrase 'Red is-a colour' can be used to describe the hyponymic relationship between ''red'' and ''colour''.
&lt;!--*''autohyponyms'' (Horn, [[1994]]) ?? --&gt;

Hyponymy is the most frequently encoded relation among [[Synonym ring|synsets]] used in lexical databases such as [[WordNet]]. These semantic relations can also be used to compare [[semantic similarity]] by judging the distance between two synsets and to analyse [[anaphora (linguistics)|Anaphora]].

As a hypernym can be understood as a more general word than its hyponym, the relation is used in [[semantic compression]] by generalization to reduce a level of [[Specialization (linguistics)|specialization]].

The notion of hyponymy is particularly relevant to [[language translation]], as hyponyms are very common across languages. For example, in Japanese the word for older brother is {{nihongo||兄|ani}}, and the word for younger brother is {{nihongo||弟|otōto}}. An English-to-Japanese translator presented with a phrase containing the English word ''brother'' would have to choose which Japanese word equivalent to use. This would be difficult, because abstract information (such as the speakers' relative ages) is often not available during [[machine translation]].

==Life and career==
Bremmer is of [[Armenian Americans|Armenian]] and German descent. His father, Arthur, served in the [[Korean War]] and died at age of 46 when Bremmer was four.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mobile.twitter.com/ianbremmer/status/797079941754003456|title=ianbremmer@Twitter|publisher=Twitter|date=11 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://m.facebook.com/ianbremmer/photos/a.382808748558842.1073741831.381748875331496/589615457878169|title=Ian Bremmer@Facebook|publisher=Facebook|date=11 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He grew up in housing projects in [[Chelsea, Massachusetts]], near [[Boston]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/1530208/Here%27s-how-the-world-works.html|title=Here's how the world works|accessdate=2008-08-01 |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |location=London |first=Damian |last=Thompson |date=September 30, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; His mother raised him and his brother with little help and little money. Bremmer went to [[Savio Preparatory High School|St. Dominic Savio High School]] in [[East Boston]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/superpower-excerpt-ian-bremmer|title="Superpower" Excerpt by Ian Bremmer|publisher=MSNBC|date=19 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later earned a BA in International Relations, ''[[magna cum laude]]'', from [[Tulane University]] in 1989 and a PhD in Political Science from Stanford University in 1994, writing "The politics of ethnicity: Russians in the Ukraine".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Ian Bremmer {{!}} World Policy Institute|url = http://www.worldpolicy.org/ian-bremmer|website =Worldpolicy.org|access-date = 2016-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= The politics of ethnicity : Russians in the Ukraine |publisher=[[Stanford University]] |url=https://searchworks.stanford.edu/view/2936585 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170327171143/https://searchworks.stanford.edu/view/2936585 |archive-date=March 27, 2017 |access-date=March 27, 2017 |language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He then served on the faculty of the [[Hoover Institution]] where, at 25, he became the Institution's youngest-ever National Fellow. In 1998, he founded the [[Eurasia Group]] and had [[Carter Page]] on its staff for three months.&lt;ref name=Politico2018-02-03&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/02/03/carter-page-nunes-memo-216934|title=Why Carter Page Was Worth Watching: There’s plenty of evidence that the former Trump campaign adviser, for all his quirks, was on suspiciously good terms with Russia.|date=February 3, 2018|work=[[Politico]]|last=Harding|first=Luke|author-link=Luke Harding|access-date=October 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|Ian Bremmer would call [[Carter Page]] the most “most wackadoodle alumnus” because Pages's very pro-Kremlin views “wasn’t a good fit”.&lt;ref name=Politico2018-02-03/&gt;}} He has held research and faculty positions at [[New York University]] (where he currently teaches), [[Columbia University]], the [[EastWest Institute]], the World Policy Institute, [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]], and the [[Asia Society]] Policy Institute, where he has served as the first Harold J. Newman Distinguished Fellow in Geopolitics since 2015.

Bremmer is most widely known for advances in political risk; referred to as the "guru" in the field by ''[[The Economist]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/18112117?story_id=18112117&amp;fsrc=rss |newspaper=[[The Economist]] |title=Beyond Economics |date=February 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/japans-nikko-asset-adds-political-risk-analysis-with-eurasia-deal-1428553465|title=Japan’s Nikko Asset Adds Political-Risk Analysis With Eurasia Deal|newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|accessdate=2017-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, more directly, bringing political science as a discipline to the financial markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/economics/7883061/The-West-should-fear-the-growth-of-state-capitalism-Ian-Bremmer.html|title=The West Should Fear the Growth of State Capitalism|accessdate=2010-07-10 |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |location=London |first=James |last=Quinn |date=July 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, Bremmer created Wall Street's first global political risk index, now the GPRI (Global Political Risk Index). Bremmer's definition of an [[emerging market]] as "a country where politics matters at least as much as economics to the market"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jcurvebook.com/HBR.pdf|title=Managing Risk in an Unstable World|website=Jcurvebook.com|accessdate=2017-07-19|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927222132/http://www.jcurvebook.com/HBR.pdf|archivedate=September 27, 2007|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a standard reference in the political risk field.

Bremmer has published ten books, including the national bestsellers ''[[Every Nation for Itself: Winners and Losers in a G-Zero World]]'' ([[Portfolio Hardcover|Portfolio]], May 2012), which details risks and opportunities in a world without global leadership, and ''[[The End of the Free Market: Who Wins the War Between States and Corporations]]'' (Portfolio, May 2010), which describes the global phenomenon of [[state capitalism]] and its implications for economics and politics. He also wrote ''[[The J Curve: A New Way to Understand Why Nations Rise and Fall]]'' (Simon &amp; Schuster, 2006), selected by ''[[The Economist]]'' as one of the best books of 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/books/displaystory.cfm?story_id=8380365 |newspaper=[[The Economist]] |title=Fighting to be tops |date=December 7, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; His latest book is ''[[Us vs Them: The Failure of Globalism]]'' (Portfolio, April 2018), which provides an analysis of the global implications of rising populist nationalism and government responses.

Bremmer is a frequent writer and commentator in the media. He is the foreign affairs columnist and editor-at-large for ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', a contributor for the ''[[Financial Times]]'' A-List,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://blogs.ft.com/the-a-list/guest-authors/ |newspaper=[[The Financial Times]] |title=The A-List |date=June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has also published articles in ''[[The Washington Post]]'', ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', ''[[Harvard Business Review]]'', ''[[Foreign Affairs]]'' and many other publications. He appears regularly on [[CNBC]], [[CNN]], [[Fox News Channel]], [[Bloomberg Television]], [[National Public Radio]], the [[British Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]], and other networks.  He has been a regular guest and occasional host of [[Charlie Rose Show]] and has appeared frequently on ''[[Real Time with Bill Maher]]''.

Among his professional appointments, Bremmer serves on the President's Council of the [[Near East Foundation]], the Leadership Council for the [[Concordia Summit]], and the Board of Trustees of [[Intelligence Squared]]. In 2007, he was named as a 'Young Global Leader' of the [[World Economic Forum]], and in 2010, founded and was appointed Chair of the Forum's Global Agenda Council for Geopolitical Risk. In December 2015, Bremmer was [[knight]]ed by the government of [[Italy]]. In 2017, he became [[LinkedIn]]'s most influential voice globally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/linkedin-top-voices-2017-influencers-daniel-roth}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He lives in [[New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ianbremmer.com/bio|title= Ian Bremmer; Biography: (Own site)|accessdate=28 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Key concepts==
Bremmer's research fields include: [[international political economy]], [[geoeconomics]] and [[geopolitics]], states in transition and global [[emerging markets]], and [[US foreign policy]].

===J-Curve===
{{Main|The J Curve: A New Way to Understand Why Nations Rise and Fall}}
[[File:The-J-Curve blanksm.jpg|right]]
Bremmer's [[The J Curve: A New Way to Understand Why Nations Rise and Fall|J curve]]&lt;ref&gt;Bremmer, Ian. 2006. ''The J Curve: A New Way to Understand Why Nations Rise and Fall''. Simon and Schuster.&lt;/ref&gt; outlines the link between a country's openness and its stability. While many countries are stable because they are open (the United States, France, Japan), others are stable because they are closed ([[North Korea]], [[Cuba]], [[Iraq]] under [[Saddam Hussein]]). States can travel both forward (right) and backwards (left) along this J curve, so stability and openness are never secure. The J is steeper on the left hand side, as it is easier for a leader in a [[failed state]] to create stability by closing the country than to build a civil society and establish accountable institutions; the curve is higher on the far right than left because states that prevail in opening their societies (Eastern Europe, for example) ultimately become more stable than [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian regimes]].

===State capitalism===
Ian Bremmer describes [[state capitalism]] as a system in which [[State (polity)|the state]] dominates markets primarily for political gain. In his book, ''[[The End of the Free Market: Who Wins the War Between States and Corporations]]'' (New York: Portfolio, 2010), Bremmer  describes China as the primary driver for the rise of state capitalism as a challenge to the [[Market economy|free market economies]] of [[Human Development Index|the developed world]], particularly in the aftermath of the [[financial crisis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/439ccee0-bec6-11df-a755-00144feab49a |title=State capitalism: China’s ‘market-Leninism’ has yet to face biggest test |website=Ft.com |accessdate=2017-07-19}} {{subscription required|date=July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{clear}}

===G-Zero===
{{Main|G-Zero world}}
The term [[G-Zero world]] refers to a breakdown in global leadership brought about by a decline of Western influence and the inability of other nations to fill the void.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eurasiagroup.net/pages/top-risks|title=Eurasia Group Top 10 Risks of 2011|website=Eurasiagroup.net|accessdate=2017-07-19|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110131233850/http://eurasiagroup.net/pages/top-risks|archivedate=January 31, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gregory Scoblete. [http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2010/05/28/free_market_fail_105754.html Will Free Markets Give Way to State Capitalism?], ''RealClearPolitics'', May 28, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; It is a reference to a perceived shift away from the pre-eminence of the ["G7"] ("[[G7|Group of Seven]]") industrialized countries and the expanded [[G-20 major economies|Group of Twenty]], which includes major emerging powers like China, [[India]], [[Brazil]], [[Turkey]], and others. In his book, ''[[Every Nation for Itself: Winners and Losers in a G-Zero World]]'' (New York: Portfolio, 2012), Bremmer explains that, in the G-Zero, no country or group of countries has the political and economic leverage to drive an international agenda or provide [[Public good|global public goods]].&lt;ref&gt;Ian Bremmer and David Gordon.[http://eurasia.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2011/01/07/g_zero G-Zero] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110912015854/http://eurasia.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2011/01/07/g_zero |date=September 12, 2011 }}, ''[[Foreign Policy]]'', January 7, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ian Bremmer and [[Nouriel Roubini]].

===Weaponization of finance===
{{Main|Weaponization of finance}}
The term ''weaponization of finance'' refers to the foreign policy strategy of using incentives (access to capital markets) and penalties (varied types of sanctions) as tools of coercive diplomacy. In his [[Eurasia Group]] Top Risks 2015 report,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://s3.amazonaws.com/toprisks2015/Top+Risks+2015.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-04-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150128072806/https://s3.amazonaws.com/toprisks2015/Top+Risks+2015.pdf |archivedate=January 28, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bremmer coins the term weaponization of finance to describe the ways in which the United States is using its influence to affect global outcomes. Rather than rely on traditional elements of America’s security advantage – including US-led alliances such as [[NATO]] and multi-lateral institutions such as the [[World Bank]] and the [[International Monetary Fund]] – Bremmer argues that the US is now ‘weaponizing finance’ by limiting access to the American marketplace and to US banks as an instrument of its foreign and security policy.

===Pivot state===
Bremmer uses 'pivot state' to describe a nation that is able to build profitable relationships with multiple other major powers without becoming overly reliant on any one of them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304811304577365990370899520|title=The Future Belongs to the Flexible|newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|accessdate=2017-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; This ability to hedge allows a pivot state to avoid capture—in terms of security or economy—at the hands of a single country. In his book, ''Every Nation for Itself: Winners and Losers in a G-Zero World'' (New York: Portfolio, 2012),&lt;ref&gt;Bremmer, Ian. ''Every Nation for Itself'', New York: Portfolio, 2012, {{ISBN|978-0670921041}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bremmer explains how, in a volatile [[G-Zero]] world, the ability to pivot will take on increased importance. At the opposite end of the spectrum are shadow states that are frozen within the influence of a single power. The [[United States]]' neighbors illustrate the terms very well. With significant trade ties with both the United States and Asia and formal security ties with [[NATO]], Canada is a good example of a pivot state that is hedged against a slowdown in or conflict with any single major power. [[Mexico]], on the other hand, is a shadow state due to its overwhelming reliance on the US economy.

[[File:4presidentes1930-1943 (2).jpg|thumb|218px|The four presidents of the period: [[José Félix Uriburu|Uriburu]], [[Agustín Pedro Justo|Justo]], [[Roberto María Ortiz|Ortiz]] and [[Ramón Castillo|Castillo]]]]
{{History of Argentina}}
The '''Infamous Decade''' (in Spanish, '''''Década Infame''''') in [[Argentina]] is the name given to the period of time that began in 1930 with the [[coup d'état]] against [[president of Argentina|President]] [[Hipólito Yrigoyen]] by [[José Félix Uriburu]] and resulted in the rising to power of [[Juan Perón]] after the [[Revolution of '43|Military coup of 1943]]. This decade was marked by significant [[rural exodus]], many small rural landowners being ruined by the [[Great Depression]], which in turn pushed the country towards [[import substitution industrialization]]. The poor economic results of the policy and popular discontent led to another coup in 1943, the "Revolution of '43", by the ''[[Grupo de Oficiales Unidos]]'' (GOU), the nationalist faction of the [[Argentine Armed Forces|Armed Forces]], against acting president [[Ramón Castillo]], putting an end to the Infamous Decade.

== The Infamous Decade ==
[[File:Golpe de Estado en Argentina en 1930.jpg|250px|thumb|left|The Coup d'état of September 6, 1930]]
This period was characterised by [[electoral fraud]], persecution of the [[opposition (politics)|political opposition]] (mainly against the [[Radical Civic Union|UCR]]) and generalised government corruption, against the background of the [[Great Depression]]. The impact of the [[Great Depression|economic crisis]] forced many farmers and other countryside workers to relocate to the outskirts of the larger cities, resulting in the creation of the first ''[[villa miseria|villas miseria]]'' (shanty towns). Thus, the [[Population of Argentina|population]] of [[Buenos Aires]] jumped from 1.5 million inhabitants in 1914 to 3.5 million in 1935.&lt;ref name=Pigna285&gt;[[Felipe Pigna]], ''Los Mitos de la Historia Argentina, 3'', ed. Planeta, 2006, p.285&lt;/ref&gt; Lacking in political experience, in contrast with the [[Immigration to Argentina|European immigrants]] who brought with them [[socialist]] and [[anarchist]] ideas, these new city-dwellers would provide the social base, in the next decade, for [[Peronism]].&lt;ref name=Pigna285/&gt;

=== Political and economic scandals ===

The democratic liberal senator [[Lisandro de la Torre]] (founder in 1914 of the [[Democratic Progressive Party (Argentina)|Democratic Progressive Party]]) denounced various scandals, directing an investigation on the meat trade starting in 1935. In the midst of the investigation, de la Torre's disciple, senator-elect [[Enzo Bordabehere]], was murdered by Ramón Valdez Cora on the Senate floor, and the province of Santa Fe was [[Federal intervention|intervened]]. The murder was depicted by [[Juan José Jusid]]'s 1984 film, ''[[Asesinato en el Senado de la Nación]]''.

CHADE (''Companía Hispano Argentina de Electricidad'', an offshoot of the Sofina multinational conglomerate) was also at the heart of an important political and financial scandal. The CHADE scandal, symbol of the Infamous Decade, led to investigations following the revolution of 1943 that deposed [[Ramón Castillo]]'s government in a military coup, and to the subsequent Rodríguez Conde report on concessions given to the electrical companies.

=== The Argentine Sacco &amp; Vanzetti show trial ===
In 1931, a year after the execution of the Italian anarchist [[Severino Di Giovanni]] and his comrade Paulino Scarfó--who had implemented a [[propaganda of the deed]] campaign aimed both at international support of the [[Sacco and Vanzetti]] case and at attacking [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Fascist Italy]]'s interests in Argentina--three anarchists were given life sentences during a [[show trial]] in which they were [[torture]]d, on the charges of having assassinated family members of conservative politician José M. Blanch.&lt;ref name="Bragado"&gt;[http://www.clarin.com/diario/2002/10/15/p-01601.htm Los "presos de Bragado", historia que culmina después de 70 años], ''[[Clarín (Argentine newspaper)|Clarín]]'', 15 October 2002 {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Known as the "prisoners of [[Bragado]]" (''presos de Bragado''), the case raised international public indignation. Anarchists, who had created a solidarity network with comrades expelled under the [[1902 Law on Residency]] which legalised the expulsion of immigrants who ''"compromise national security or disturb public order"'', were considered as public enemies by Uriburu's dictatorship.&lt;ref name="Bragado"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Felipe Pigna, 2006, p.265-281&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to their execution, three anarchist bombs had detonated at three strategic places on the Buenos Aires railway network on 20 January 1931, killing three and wounding 17.&lt;ref&gt;The New York Times, BLASTS KILL THREE IN BUENOS AIRES, 21 January 1931.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1942 Minister [[Vicente Solano Lima|Solano Lima]] signed the prisoners' releases; their names were cleared by a 1993 law upheld by [[Popular Socialist Party (Argentina)|Socialist]] deputy [[Guillermo Estévez Boero]].&lt;ref name="Bragado"/&gt; In 2003 a law granted a pension to the daughter of one of the anarchist victims of this show trial.&lt;ref name="Bragado"/&gt;

== Justo's presidency (1932&amp;ndash;1938) ==

In 1933 [[Arturo Jauretche]] took part in a failed uprising, led by Col. [[Francisco Bosch (Argentina)|Francisco Bosch]] and Col. [[Gregorio Pomar]] in [[Paso de los Libres]], in the province of [[Corrientes Province|Corrientes]]. He was subsequently detained.

=== Economic and social policy ===

{{See|Economy of Argentina}}

==== The Roca-Runciman Treaty ====
{{Main|Roca-Runciman Treaty}}
It was during Justo's term that Argentina signed the [[Roca-Runciman Treaty]] with the United Kingdom, which assured the UK a provision of fresh meat in exchange for important investments in the field of [[transportation in Argentina]], given certain economic concessions from Argentina, such as giving control over the public transport in Buenos Aires to a British company, the ''Corporación de Transportes''.

At the 1932 [[Ottawa Conference]], the British had adopted measures that favored imports from its own colonies and dominions. The pressure from Argentine landowners for whom the government restored trade with the main buyer of Argentine grain and meat had been very strong. Led by the president of the British Trade Council, Viscount [[Walter Runciman, 1st Viscount Runciman of Doxford|Walter Runciman]], they were intense and resulted in the signing on April 27 of the Roca-Runciman Treaty.

The treaty created a scandal, because the UK allotted Argentina a quota less than any of its dominions--390,000 tons of meat per year were allotted to Argentina in exchange for many concessions to British companies, and 85% of exportation had to be arranged through British refrigerated shippers. In addition, the tariffs of the railways operated by the UK were not regulated, the treaty did not establish customs fees over coal,  had given special dispensation to British companies with investments in Argentina and had reduced the prices of their exports. So many problems resulted from the treaty that Vice President Roca, after the signing of the treaty, declared, "By its economic importance, Argentina resembles just a large British dominion." {{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} [[Lisandro de la Torre]], one of Roca's principal and most vociferous opponents, mocking his words in an editorial, wrote, ''"In these conditions we wouldn't be able to say that Argentina had been converted into a British dominion because England does not take the liberty to impose similar humiliations upon its dominions."'' {{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

The National Democratic Party, one of the parties that had supported the nomination of Justo for President, had split because of this controversy. Finally the Senate rescinded the treaty on July 28. Many workers strikes followed the deliberations, especially in [[Santa Fé Province]], which ended with government intervention.

==== Import substitution industrialization and Pinedo's economic policies ====
On the other hand, the trade isolationism of the world powers ultimately prompted the beginning of Argentine industrial development via [[import substitution]]. Important firms, such as the [[Bunge &amp; Born]] [[agribusiness]] food company and the [[Ernesto Tornquist|Tornquist group]], previously turned towards exports but began to diversify their activities and invest in national industries aimed at local consumption.&lt;ref name=Pigna284/&gt;

Under the direction of  conservative [[Minister of Economy (Argentina)|Minister of Economy]] [[Federico Pinedo]], economic policy became interventionist, although still in a conservative aim. Pinedo created the [[Banco Central de la República Argentina|Central Bank]] (BCRA), which was advised by Sir [[Otto Niemeyer]], the director of the [[Bank of England]].&lt;ref name=Pigna284&gt;[[Felipe Pigna]], ''Los Mitos de la Historia Argentina, 3'', ed. Planeta, 2006, p.284&lt;/ref&gt; The BCRA's board of director was mainly composed of personalities tied to private banks. It had as its missions the managing of the [[Argentine peso|peso]] and the regulation of [[interest rates]].&lt;ref name=Pigna284/&gt; Writer and thinker [[Raúl Scalabrini Ortiz]] was a strong critic of British involvement in Argentina, of which the BCRA itself was the prime example.

The ''[[Juntas Reguladores Nacionales]]'' were also created during this period, aimed at developing private and state activities and controlling the quality of products, both for national consumption and for export.&lt;ref name=Pigna284/&gt; In order to [[price support|support prices]] of products and avoid [[overproduction]], the Juntas destroyed entire loads of [[Maize|corn]], used as fuel for locomotives, despite popular hunger.&lt;ref name=Pigna284/&gt; Thirty million pesos per year were spent to destroy [[wine]] products.&lt;ref name=Pigna284/&gt;

Furthermore, Pinedo launched a national project of road construction, the national network reaching 30,000 kilometers in 1938 (although many remained without pavement).&lt;ref name=Pigna284/&gt; This competed with the [[railway system in Argentina|railway system]], in the hands of mostly British companies, and furthered the penetration of US firms selling motor vehicles, in the Argentine market.&lt;ref name=Pigna284/&gt; US [[foreign direct investment]] (FDI) grew during this time, with companies such as the textile firms [[Sudamtex]], [[Ducilo]] and [[Anderson Clayton]] establishing themselves in Argentina, as well as the tire companies [[Firestone Tire and Rubber Company|Firestone]] and [[Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company|Goodyear]], the electronics firm [[Philco]] and the chemistry firm [[Johnson &amp; Johnson]].&lt;ref name=Pigna284/&gt;

Notable exceptions to these conservative policies were the policies of [[Luciano Molinas]], governor of the [[Santa Fe Province]] (1932–1936) and one of the leader of the [[Democratic Progressive Party (Argentina)|Democratic Progressive Party]], and of [[Amadeo Sabattini]], [[Governor of Córdoba]] (1936–1940). The first act of governor Molinas, assuming office on February 20, 1932, was to re-establish the progressive [[Constitution of the Santa Fe Province]] established by the Constituent Assembly of 1921, which had been abrogated by the radical governor [[Enrique Mosca]].&lt;ref name=Pigna289&gt;Felipe Pigna, 2006, p.289&lt;/ref&gt; He also ensured independence of the judicial system, tax equality, [[Education in Argentina|secular education]], [[women's suffrage]] and [[right of foreigners' to vote]] for the election of communal authorities.&lt;ref name=Pigna289/&gt; Molinas' administration also created the Provincial Department of Labour, which ensured the observance of article 28 of the provincial Constitution, concerning the [[8 hours day]], [[minimum wages]] and regulation of [[child labour|child]] and female labour.&lt;ref name=Pigna289/&gt; Molinas also reduced his salary from 2,500 to 1,800 pesos,&lt;ref name=Pigna289/&gt; suspended payment of the external debt of the province, which permitted Santa Fe's budget to become positive. Henceforth, he subsidized public works under the impulsion of the minister [[Alberto Casella]], leading to increased local employment.&lt;ref name=Pigna289/&gt; He also implemented moderate land reforms, harshly opposed by the conservative and Alvearist radicals, as well as the ''[[Sociedad Rural]]''.&lt;ref name=Pigna290&gt;Felipe Pigna, 2006, p.290&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, he created the Experimental Institute of Agricultural Investigation, a predecessor of the [[Instituto Nacional de Tecnología Agropecuaria|National Agricultural Technology Institute]] (INTA).&lt;ref name=Pigna289/&gt;

However, fearing electoral defeats for the ''[[Concordancia (Argentina)|Concordancia]]'' both in Santa Fe and in the Electoral College, Justo ordered military intervention in the Santa Fe Province on October 3, 1935, sending the Colonel Perlinger and the minister [[Joaquín F. Rodríguez]] to take control of the local government.&lt;ref&gt;Felipe Pigna, 2006, p.290-292&lt;/ref&gt; Armed resistance against the federal intervention occurred, but in order to avoid a bloodbath, Molinas and De la Torre rejected the resistance.&lt;ref name=Pigna290/&gt; Rodríguez soon abrogated again the 1921 Constitution and progressively dismantled Molinas' achievements.&lt;ref name=Pigna290/&gt;

Justo had already ordered intervention in the [[Province of San Juan (Argentina)|Provinces of San Juan]] and [[Province of Tucumán|Tucumán]] in 1934, and ordered similar military interventions in [[Catamarca Province|Catamarca]], [[Santa Fe Province|Santa Fe]] and [[Buenos Aires Province|Buenos Aires]] in 1935 (the latter enabling the fraudulent election of [[Manuel Fresco]] as governor &lt;ref name=Pigna297/&gt;). Despite this federal intervention, [[Marcelo Alvear]]'s [[Civic Radical Union|Radical party]] (UCR) decided in 1935 to abandon its abstentionist policy protesting the fraud. Opposed to Alvear's turnaround, in 1935, young Yrigoyenistas from a nationalist background founded [[FORJA]] (''Fuerza Orientadora Radical de la Juventud Argentina'', Radical Orienting Force of Argentine Youth), which had as leaders the Socialist [[Arturo Jauretche]], [[Raúl Scalabrini Ortiz]] and [[Gabriel del Mazo]]. FORJA's motto was: "We are a [[colonialism|colonial]] Argentina, we want to be a free Argentina." &lt;ref&gt;Spanish: ''Somos una Argentina colonial, queremos ser una Argentina libre.'' Quoted by Felipe Pigna, 2006, p.296&lt;/ref&gt; Among other things, FORJA denounced the silence of the government on many problems such as the creation of the Central Bank, "economic sacrifices imposed in benefices of foreign capitalism", "[[petroleum politics]]", "arbitrary military interventions", "restrictions to freedom of opinion", "incorporation to the [[League of Nations]]", "suppression of relations with Russia", "parliamentary investigations", "the Senate crime", etc.&lt;ref name=Pigna296&gt;Felipe Pigna, 2006, p.296&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The workers' movement ===

At the time of the 1930 coup, three [[Trade unions in Argentina|trade unions]] existed in Argentina: the ''[[Confederación Obrera Argentina]]'' (COA, founded in 1926 and linked to the [[Socialist Party (Argentina)|Socialist Party]]), the ''[[Unión Sindical Argentina]]'' (USA, [[anarcho-syndicalist]]) and the [[Argentine Regional Workers' Federation|FORA V]] (dissolved by Uriburu). On September 20, 1930, the COA and the USA merged in the [[General Confederation of Labour (Argentina)|General Confederation of Labour]] (CGT), although the two rival tendencies remained.

Meanwhile, the syndicalist current of the CGT was discredited, because of its supporting alliance with the government in order to achieve social advances, while the socialist current proposed open opposition, tied to political support to the Socialist party. The syndicalist current was in particular affected by its agreements with the pro-[[fascist]] [[governor of Buenos Aires]], [[Manuel Fresco]] (1936–1940).&lt;ref name=Pigna286&gt;[[Felipe Pigna]], ''Los Mitos de la Historia Argentina, 3'', ed. Planeta, 2006, p.286&lt;/ref&gt; The latter, who had been elected during one of the "most burlesque" and "fraudulent" elections of the Infamous Decade (according to the words of the US embassador &lt;ref name=Pigna297&gt;Felipe Pigna, 2006, p.297&lt;/ref&gt;),  commissioned the architect [[Francisco Salamone]] various buildings, which combined [[Art Deco]], [[Functionalism (architecture)|functionalism]], [[Futurism]] and [[Fascist architecture]]s.&lt;ref name=Belluci&gt;Alberto Belluci, [https://www.jstor.org/pss/1504091 Monumental Deco in the Pampas: The Urban Art of Francisco Salamone], ''[[The Journal of Decorative and Propaganda Arts]]'', Vol. 18, Argentine Theme Issue (1992), pp. 91-121. {{en icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the [[Great Depression]] and the subsequent [[rural exodus]] had brought many politically inexperienced workers to [[Buenos Aires]], the spontaneous [[import substitution industrialization]] enabled, starting in 1935,&lt;ref name=Pigna286/&gt; coupled to the strengthening of trade unions, wages' increase.&lt;ref name=Pigna286/&gt; Henceforth, a 48-hour [[general strike]] was launched in January 1936 by workers' in construction, during which 3 workers and 3 policemen were killed.&lt;ref name=Pigna286/&gt;

== Ortiz and Castillo administration (1938&amp;ndash;1943) ==

[[Roberto Marcelino Ortiz]] and [[Ramón S. Castillo]]'s candidacies, respectively as president and vice-president, for the 1938 elections were launched at the British Chamber of Commerce, and supported by its president [[William Mc Callum]].&lt;ref name=Pigna297/&gt; Ortiz, a former Alvearista, was fraudulently elected, and assumed his new office in February 1938.&lt;ref name=Pigna297/&gt; However, without much success, he attempted to clean up the country's corruption, ordering federal intervention in the [[Province of Buenos Aires]], governed by Manuel Fresco, and cancelling the fraudulent elections which had been won by the conservative [[Alberto Barceló]].&lt;ref name=Pigna297/&gt;

Federico Pinedo, still Minister of Economy, presented on 18 November 1940 an "Economic Reactivation Plan", which was to implement some [[protectionism|protectionist]] measures and building of social lodging in order to face the crisis. He also proposed the nationalization of the British railways, having agreed upon advantageous terms for their owners with them beforehand. However, the conservatives voted against his plan, which led him to resign.&lt;ref name=Pigna298-299&gt;Felipe Pigna, 2006, p.298-299&lt;/ref&gt;

During World War II, Argentina maintained the same neutrality it had adopted during the [[World War I|first World War]], which was advantageous for Great Britain. Although the USA attempted to push the country into the war, during the January 1942 [[1942 Rio Conference|Rio de Janeiro Conference]], Argentina resisted, with support from the British.&lt;ref name=Pigna302&gt;Felipe Pigna, 2006, p.302&lt;/ref&gt; A few months later, in June 1942, Ortiz resigned because of his sickness, and died a month later.

He was replaced by his vice-president Castillo, who began to work to launch the candidacy of [[Robustiano Patrón Costas]], vice-president of the Senate and sugar entrepreneur, who had supported him in 1938. Meanwhile, the [[Democratic Union (Argentina)|Democratic Union]] political coalition (which included the [[Radical Civic Union]], the [[Democratic Progressive Party (Argentina)|Democratic Progressive Party]], as well as the [[Socialist Party (Argentina)|Socialist Party]] and the [[Communist Party (Argentina)|Communist Party]]) had been formed in 1942. Their electoral platform, aimed against endemic corruption, announced the needs to guarantee "freedom of thought and assembly" and "labor union rights", as well as vouching for "active solidarity with the people struggling against the Nazi-Fascist aggression".&lt;ref name=Pigna302/&gt;

== June 1943 coup ==
{{main|Revolution of '43}}
On 4 June 1943, the nationalist faction of the army, gathered around the ''[[Grupo de Oficiales Unidos]]'' (GOU, formed in March 1943) opposed both to corruption and to the Left, overthrew Castillo in a coup. Composed under the initiative of the colonel [[Miguel A. Montes]] and [[Urbano de la Vega]], the GOU included as main members the colonel [[Juan Domingo Perón]] and [[Enrique P. González]]. Sympathisers of [[Nazi Germany]] and [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Fascist Italy]],&lt;ref name=Pigna304&gt;Felipe Pigna, 2006, p.304&lt;/ref&gt; the GOU established General [[Pedro Pablo Ramírez|Pedro Ramírez]] as chief of state, despite a short attempt by General [[Arturo Rawson]] to claim the office.

== Presidents of the Infamous Decade ==
*[[José Félix Uriburu]] (1930–1931)
*[[Agustín Pedro Justo]] (1932–1938)
*[[Roberto Marcelino Ortiz]] (1938–1940)
*[[Ramón S. Castillo]] (1940–1943)

=='Second' Infamous Decade== 
The 10-year-long presidency of [[Carlos Menem]] (two consecutive periods, 1989&amp;ndash;1999) has been referred to as the "second" (or "new") Infamous Decade by strong critics of its [[neoliberalism|neoliberalist]] policies and its perceived corruption, especially from the left wing. The period 1999&amp;ndash;2001 under [[Fernando de la Rúa]] is sometimes included, as a continuation of those policies.&lt;ref&gt;For the expression ''Década Infame'' applied to Menem's administration, see for example [http://www.clarin.com/diario/1999/07/07/t-02402d.htm Clarín], [http://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/elpais/1-45505-2005-01-02.html Página/12], [http://www.lacapital.com.ar/2003/10/05/Seniales/noticia_41735.shtml La Capital].&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Lebanese Resistance Regiments''' ({{lang-ar|أفواج المقاومة اللبنانية}} | '''''A'''fwaj al-'''M'''uqawama al-'''L'''ubnaniyya'', '''AMAL'''), also designated '''Lebanese Resistance Battalions''', '''Lebanese Resistance Detachments''', '''Lebanese Resistance Legions''' and '''Battalions de la Resistance Libanaise (BRL)''' or '''Légions de la Resistance Libanaise (LRL)''' in [[French language|French]], but simply known by its [[Arabic]] acronym '''Amal''' which means "Hope", were the military wing of the '''[[Amal movement|Movement of the Dispossessed]]''' or '''Movement of the Deprived''', a political organization representing the [[Shia Islam in Lebanon|Muslim Shia community of Lebanon]]. The movement's political wing was officially founded in February 1973 from a previous organization bearing the same name and its military wing was formed in January 1975. The Amal militia was a major player in the [[Lebanese Civil War]] from 1975 to 1991. The militia has now been disarmed, though the movement itself, now known as the [[Amal Movement]] ([[Arabic]]: ''Harakat Amal''), is a notable [[List of political parties in Lebanon|Shia political party in Lebanon]].

==Creation==
The Amal militia was founded in 1975 as the militant wing of the Movement of the Disinherited, a [[Shi'a]] political movement founded by [[Musa al-Sadr]]&lt;ref&gt;http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/7584557.stm&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Hussein el-Husseini]] a year earlier. It became one of the most important Shi'a Muslim militias during the [[Lebanese Civil War]]. Amal grew strong with the support of, and through its ties with, [[Syria]]&lt;ref name="Byman"&gt;Byman, ''Deadly Connections: States that Sponsor Terrorism'' (2005), page unknown.&lt;/ref&gt; and the 300,000 Shi'a internal refugees from southern Lebanon after the Israeli bombings in the early 1980s. Amal's practical objectives were to gain greater respect for [[Lebanon]]'s Shi'ite population and the allocation of a larger share of governmental resources for the Shi'ite-dominated southern part of the country.&lt;ref name="Palmer"/&gt;

At its zenith, the militia had 14,000 troops. Amal fought a long campaign against Palestinian refugees during the Lebanese Civil War (called the [[War of the Camps]]).  After the War of the Camps, Amal fought a bloody battle against rival Shi'a group [[Hezbollah]] for control of [[Beirut]], which provoked Syrian military intervention. Hezbollah itself was formed by religious members of Amal who had left after [[Nabih Berri]]'s assumption of full control and the subsequent resignation of most of Amal's earliest senior members.

==History==

===Timeline===
[[Harakat al-Mahrumin]] (حركة المحرومين | The Movement of the Dispossessed) was established by Imam [[Musa al-Sadr]] and member of parliament [[Hussein el-Husseini]] in 1974.
On January 20, 1975 the Lebanese Resistance Detachments (also referred to in English as 'Battalions of the Lebanese Resistance') is formed as the military wing of the Movement of the Disinherited under the leadership of al-Sadr.  In 1978 the founder al-Sadr disappears in mysterious circumstances while visiting [[Libya]] and was succeeded by [[Hussein el-Husseini]] as leader of Amal.

In 1979 [[Palestine Liberation Organization|Palestinian]] guerrillas attempt to assassinate then-Secretary General [[Hussein el-Husseini]] by launching missiles into his home, outside [[Beirut]].

In 1980 Hussein el-Husseini resigned from Amal leadership after refusing to "drench Amal in blood" and fight alongside the [[PLO]] or any other faction.

In 1980 [[Nabih Berri]] became one of the leaders of Amal, marking the entry of Amal in the Lebanese Civil War.

In summer 1982 [[Husayn Al-Musawi]], deputy head and official spokesman of Amal, broke away to form the [[Islamist]] [[Islamic Amal]] Movement. In May 1985, heavy fighting erupted between Amal and Palestinian camp militias for the control of the Sabra, Shatila and Burj el-Barajneh camps in Beirut, sparking the so-called "War of the Camps" which lasted until 1987.

In December 1985 Nabih Berri of Amal, [[Walid Jumblatt]] of the Druze [[Progressive Socialist Party]], and [[Elie Hobeika]] of the [[Lebanese Forces]] signed the [[Tripartite Accord (Lebanon)|Tripartite Accord]] in Damascus which was supposed to give strong influence to Damascus regarding Lebanese matters. The agreement never came into effect due to Hobeika's ousting.

Heavy fighting erupted between [[Hezbollah]] and Amal in the wake of the "War of Camps" to which [[Hezbollah]] was opposed to. Syrian forces entered the area to help Amal against [[Hezbollah]], Syrian troops killed dozens of Hezbollah members in which they claimed the members attacked them while Hezbollah claimed they were killed in cold blood. Fighting between the two factions lasted until 1989.&lt;ref name="meib.org"&gt;[http://www.meib.org/articles/0202_l1.htm Hezbollah: Between Tehran and Damascus] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013193510/http://www.meib.org/articles/0202_l1.htm |date=2007-10-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 22, 1987, Amal and the Druze PLA again turned against each other in what became known as the "War of the Flag". The conflict was sparked by an incident early that day, when a PLA fighter walked to the Channel 7 TV station ([[French language|French]]: ''Télé Liban – Canal 7'') building in the [[Tallet el-Khayyat]] quarter&lt;ref&gt;Hokayem, ''L'armée libanaise pendant la guerre: un instrument du pouvoir du président de la République (1975–1985)'' (2012), p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; and replaced the [[Flag of Lebanon|Lebanese national flag]] hoisted there by the PSP flag, which was interpreted by Amal militiamen as a deliberate act of provocation. A new round of brutal fighting soon spread throughout western Beirut, and although Amal forces initially managed to restore the Lebanese national flag on the Channel 7 building, they were subsequently overpowered by an alliance of PLA, LCP/[[Popular Guard]] and SSNP militias, who quickly seized large portions of West Beirut. Eventually, the fighting was curbed by the massive deployment at West Beirut of Syrian troops under the command of Major-General [[Ghazi Kanaan]], assisted by Lebanese [[Internal Security Forces]] (ISF) gendarmes.

On February 17, 1988 the American Chief of the [[United Nations Truce Supervision Organization]] (UNTSO) observer mission in Lebanon, Lt. Col. [[William R. Higgins]], was abducted and later killed after meeting with Amal's political leader of southern Lebanon. Amal responded by launching a campaign against Hezbollah in the south, It was believed that Hezbollah abducted him; Though the party to this day denies it and insists that it was done to create problems between them and the Amal movement.&lt;ref name="Ranstorp"&gt;Ranstorp, ''Hizb'allah in Lebanon'' (1997), p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1988 Amal launched an all-out assault on Hezbollah positions in south Lebanon and the southern suburbs of Beirut. Early in May 1988 Hezbollah gained control of 80% of the Shi'ite suburbs of [[Beirut]] through well-timed assaults.

In 1989 Amal accepted the [[Taif agreement]] (mainly authored by el-Husseini) in order to end the civil war.

In September 1991, with background in the Syrian controlled end of the Lebanese Civil War in October 1990, 2,800 Amal troops joined the Lebanese army.

===Origin===
The origins of the Amal movement lie with the [[Lebanon|Lebanese]] cleric of Iranian origin Imam [[Musa al-Sadr]].  In 1974, the [[Deprived Movement|Harakat al-Mahrumin]] (Movement of the Deprived)&lt;ref&gt;Nasr, ''The Shia Revival'' (2006), p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt; was established by al-Sadr and member of parliament [[Hussein el-Husseini]] to attempt to reform the Lebanese system. While acknowledging its support base to be the "traditionally under-represented politically and economically disadvantaged" [[Shi'a]] community,&lt;ref&gt;Byman, ''Deadly Connections: States that Sponsor Terrorism'' (2005), p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt; it aimed, according to Palmer-Harik, to seek social justice for all deprived Lebanese.&lt;ref name="Palmer"&gt;Palmer-Harik, ''Hezbollah: The Changing Face of Terrorism'' (2004), page unknown.&lt;/ref&gt;  Although influenced by [[Islamic]] ideas, it was a [[secular]] movement trying to unite people along communal rather than religious or ideological lines.&lt;ref name="Byman"/&gt; The [[Greek-Catholic]] Archbishop of [[Beirut]], Mgr. Grégoire Haddad, was among the founders of the Movement.&lt;ref&gt;[[Augustus Richard Norton]], ''[http://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.cgi?path=238301210371469 Hezbollah: A Short History]'' Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://religion.info/english/interviews/article_317.shtml Hizbullah, a progressive Islamic party? - Interview with Joseph Alagha]&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 20, 1975, the Lebanese Resistance Detachments (also referred to in English as 'The Battalions of the Lebanese Resistance') were formed as a military wing of The Movement of the Disinherited under the leadership of al-Sadr, and came to be popularly known as Amal (from the acronym ''Afwaj al-Mouqawma Al-Lubnaniyya'').&lt;ref name="Palmer"/&gt;  In 1978, al-Sadr disappeared in mysterious circumstances while visiting [[Libya]], the Amal movement's regional supporter at the time. There are credible allegations that Yasser Arafat asked Gaddafi to "disappear" al-Sadr. Hussein el-Husseini became leader of Amal and was followed by [[Nabih Berri]] in April 1980 after el-Husseini resigned. One of the consequences of the rise of Berri, a less educated leader, the increasing secular yet sectarian nature of the movement and move away from an Islamic context for the movement was a splintering of the movement.

==Military structure and organization==
The movement's militia was secretly established on 20 January 1975 with the help of the Palestinian [[Fatah]], who provided weapons and training at their [[Beqaa Governorate|Beqaa]] facilities.  The formation of Amal was revealed in July that year when an accidental explosion of a landmine at one of the [[Fatahland]] camps near [[Baalbek]] killed over 60 Shia trainees, which caused considerable embarrassment to Fatah and forced Al-Sadr to admit publicly the militia's existence.&lt;ref&gt;Weinberger, ''Syrian Intervention in Lebanon: The 1975-76 Civil War'' (1986), p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ammoun, ''Histoire du Liban contemporain: Tome 2 1943-1990'' (2005), page unknown.&lt;/ref&gt; When the civil war finally broke out in April 1975, Amal's strength stood at about 1,500–3,000 armed militants, backed by a motor force of [[gun-truck]]s (a.k.a. [[Technical (vehicle)|technicals]]) fitted with [[heavy machine guns]], [[recoilless rifles]] and [[anti-aircraft]] [[autocannons]].

By the mid-1980s however, the movement totaled 14,000–16,000 militiamen trained and armed by [[Syria]], of which 3,000–6,000 were full-time uniformed regulars&lt;ref&gt;Makdisi and Sadaka, ''The Lebanese Civil War, 1975-1990'' (2003), p. 44, Table 1: War Period Militias.&lt;/ref&gt; and the remaining 10,000 part-time male and female irregulars. Amal's regular forces were bolstered by 6,000 ex-[[Lebanese Army]] soldiers from the [[6th Infantry Brigade (Lebanon)|Sixth Brigade]], a predominantly [[Shi'a Islam in Lebanon|Shia Muslim]] formation that went over to their co-religionists following the collapse of the government forces in February 1984.&lt;ref&gt;O'Ballance, ''Civil War in Lebanon'' (1998), p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt; Commanded by the Shi'ite [[Major-General]] [[Abd al-Halim Kanj]], and headquartered at the [[Henri Chihab]] Barracks at Jnah in the south-western [[Chyah]] suburb of West Beirut, this formation was subsequently enlarged by absorbing Shia deserters from other Army units, which included the 97th Battalion from the [[7th Infantry Brigade (Lebanon)|Seventh Brigade]]. Outside the Lebanese Capital, Amal militia forces operating in [[Baalbek]] and [[Hermel]] received support from certain elements of the mainly Shi'ite [[1st Infantry Brigade (Lebanon)|First Brigade]] stationed in the [[Beqaa Valley]].&lt;ref name="Bicard, p. 16"&gt;Bicard, ''Prospects for Lebanon – The Demobilization of the Lebanese Militias'', p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Weapons and equipment==
Most of Amal's own weapons and equipment were provided by the [[Palestine Liberation Organization|PLO]], [[Libya]],&lt;ref&gt;El-Kazen, ''The Breakdown of the State in Lebanon'' (2000), pp. 332-333.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Iran]] and [[Syria]] or pilfered from [[Lebanese Armed Forces]] (LAF) and [[Internal Security Forces]] (ISF) reserves after their collapse in January 1976. Additional weaponry, vehicles and other, non-lethal military equipments were procured in the international [[black market]].

===Small-arms===
Amal militiamen were provided with a variety of small-arms, including [[MAT-49]] submachine guns, [[M1 Garand]] (or its Italian-produced copy, the Beretta Model 1952) and [[SKS]] [[semi-automatic rifle]]s, [[AMD-65]] assault carbines, [[CETME rifle|CETME Model C]], [[Heckler &amp; Koch G3]],&lt;ref name="Volstad, 1988 p. 46"&gt;Katz and Volstad, ''Arab Armies of the Middle East Wars 2'' (1988), p. 46, Plate G3.&lt;/ref&gt; [[FN FAL]], [[M16 rifle|M16A1]], [[AK-47]] and [[AKM]] assault rifles (other variants included the [[Zastava M70]], Chinese [[Type 56]], Romanian [[Puşcă Automată model 1986|AIM]], Bulgarian AKK/AKKS and former East German MPi assault rifles). Several models of handguns were also used, including [[TT pistol|Tokarev TT-33]], [[CZ 75]], [[Browning Hi-Power|FN P35]] and [[MAB PA-15 pistol]]s. Squad weapons consisted of [[Heckler &amp; Koch HK21]], [[RPK]], [[RPD machine gun|RPD]], [[PK machine gun|PK/PKM]], [[Rheinmetall MG 3]], [[FN MAG]] and [[M60 machine gun|M60 light machine guns]],&lt;ref name="Volstad, 1988 p. 46"/&gt; with heavier [[M1919 Browning machine gun|Browning M1919A4 .30 Cal]], [[M2 Browning|Browning M2HB .50 Cal]] and [[DShK]] machine guns being employed as platoon and company weapons. Grenade launchers and portable anti-tank weapons consisted of [[M79 grenade launcher]]s, [[M72 LAW]] and [[RPG-7]] [[Anti-tank rocket|rocket launchers]], whilst crew-served and indirect fire weapons included [[M2 mortar|M2 60mm light mortars]] and [[120-PM-43 mortar|120-PM-43 (M-1943) 120mm heavy mortars]], plus [[M20 recoilless rifle|Type 56 75mm]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://milinme.wordpress.com/2011/03/13/toyota-land-cruiser-in-lebanon-cluster-1-militias/ A Toyota Land Cruiser BJ40/42 of the AMAL militia in 1984 armed with a Chinese made Type 56 75mm recoilless rifle.]&lt;/ref&gt; [[B-10 recoilless rifle|B-10 82mm]] and [[M40 recoilless rifle|M40A1 106mm]] [[recoilless rifle]]s (often mounted on [[Technical (vehicle)|technicals]]). Soviet [[PTRS-41|PTRS-41 14.5mm anti-tank rifles]] were used for heavy sniping.

===Armored and transport vehicles===
[[File:Page-28-Image-28.png|thumb|Amal fighters manning a T-55A tank provided by Syria, Beirut 1980s.]]

Amal's technicals' fleet consisted mostly of [[M151 1/4-ton 4x4 utility truck|M151A2]] jeeps, [[Land Rover Series|Land Rover II-III]],&lt;ref&gt;El-Assad, ''Civil Wars Volume 1: The Gun Trucks'' (2008), p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Toyota Land Cruiser (J40)]],&lt;ref name="Kassis, 2003 p. 62"&gt;Kassis, ''30 Years of Military Vehicles in Lebanon'' (2003), p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jeep Gladiator|Jeep Gladiator J20]],&lt;ref name="Kassis, 2003 p. 62"/&gt; [[GMC (automobile)|GMC]] Sierra Custom K25/K30, Chevrolet C-10 Cheyenne, Chevrolet C-20 Scottsdale and [[Chevrolet C/K|Chevrolet C/K 3rd generation]] light pickups, and Chevrolet Series 50 light-duty, Dodge F600 medium-duty and GMC C7500 heavy-duty trucks, partially supplanted in the 1980s by [[Volvo L3314|Volvo Laplander L3314A]] light utility vehicles,&lt;ref name="Kassis, 2003 p. 62"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;El-Assad, ''Civil Wars Volume 1: The Gun Trucks'' (2008), p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ram Pickup|Dodge Ram (1st generation) pickups]],&lt;ref&gt;El-Assad, ''Civil Wars Volume 1: The Gun Trucks'' (2008), pp. 66-67.&lt;/ref&gt; [[:es:Santana Ligero|Santana 88 Ligero Militar jeeps]],&lt;ref&gt;El-Assad, ''Civil Wars Volume 1: The Gun Trucks'' (2008), pp. 64-65.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nissan Patrol|Nissan Patrol 160-Series pickups]],&lt;ref&gt;El-Assad, ''Civil Wars Volume 1: The Gun Trucks'' (2008), pp. 68-69.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[M35 2½-ton cargo truck|M35A1 and M35A2 2½-ton 6x6 cargo trucks]].&lt;ref&gt;Kassis, ''30 Years of Military Vehicles in Lebanon'' (2003), p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;El-Assad, ''Civil Wars Volume 1: The Gun Trucks'' (2008), pp. 115; 117.&lt;/ref&gt; 
The Sixth Brigade aligned an armoured battalion fielding [[Alvis Saladin]]&lt;ref&gt;Kassis, ''30 Years of Military Vehicles in Lebanon'' (2003), p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Panhard AML|Panhard AML-90]] [[armored car (military)|armoured cars]], [[AMX-13]] light tanks, [[M48 Patton|M48A5]] [[main battle tank]]s,&lt;ref name="Kassis, 2003 p. 65"&gt;Kassis, ''30 Years of Military Vehicles in Lebanon'' (2003), p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt; and three to four mechanized infantry battalions on [[M113 armored personnel carrier|M113]], [[Alvis Saracen]] and [[Véhicule de l'Avant Blindé|VAB]] (4x4)&lt;ref&gt;Zaloga, ''Tank battles of the Mid-East Wars'' (2003), pp. 53; 57-58.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kassis, ''Véhicules Militaires au Liban/Military Vehicles in Lebanon'' (2012), p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mahé, ''La Guerre Civile Libanaise, un chaos indescriptible (1975-1990)'', p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt; [[armored personnel carrier]]s. The collapse of the [[4th Infantry Brigade (Lebanon)|Fourth Brigade]] in February 1984 also allowed Amal to seize an additional number of AMX-13 light tanks and [[AMX-VCI]] and M113 APCs.&lt;ref&gt;Kassis, ''30 Years of Military Vehicles in Lebanon'' (2003), pp. 64-65.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the well-equipped Beirut-based Amal forces also operated 30 or 50 Syrian-loaned [[T-54/55|T-55A]] MBTs,&lt;ref name="Kassis, 2003 p. 65"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bicard, p. 15"&gt;Bicard, ''Prospects for Lebanon – The Demobilization of the Lebanese Militias'', p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; and three ex-PLO [[ZSU-23-4|ZSU-23-4M Shilka]] [[Self-propelled anti-aircraft weapon|SPAAG]] tracked vehicles seized from the [[Al-Mourabitoun]] in April 1985,&lt;ref&gt;Micheletti, ''Les véhicules de la Guerre du Liban'', RAIDS magazine (1994), p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; whereas their guerrilla units fighting in the south of the country were able to add a few M113 Zelda&lt;ref&gt;El-Assad, ''Blue Steel III: M-113 Carriers in South Lebanon'' (2007), p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kassis, 2003 p. 65"/&gt; and [[M3 Half-track|M3/M9 Zahlam]] half-tracks&lt;ref&gt;Kassis, ''30 Years of Military Vehicles in Lebanon'' (2003), p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;El-Assad, ''Blue Steel: M-3 Halftracks in South Lebanon'' (2006), p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt; captured from the [[Israel Defense Forces]] (IDF) and their [[South Lebanon Army]] (SLA) proxies.

===Artillery===
Amal also fielded a powerful artillery corps equipped with Syrian-loaned Soviet [[130 mm towed field gun M1954 (M-46)]] and [[122 mm howitzer 2A18 (D-30)]] pieces,&lt;ref&gt;Micheletti, ''Bataille d'artillerie'', RAIDS magazine (1989), p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; towed [[Type 63 multiple rocket launcher|Type 63 107mm]]&lt;ref&gt;Kassis, ''30 Years of Military Vehicles in Lebanon'' (2003), p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; and truck-mounted BM-13 122mm [[multiple rocket launcher]]s,&lt;ref name="Kassis, 2003 p. 65"/&gt; whilst the Sixth Brigade aligned an artillery battalion equipped with US [[M114 155 mm howitzer]]s. Soviet [[ZPU|ZPU (ZPU-1, ZPU-2, ZPU-4)]] 14.5mm and [[ZU-23-2]] 23mm Anti-Aircraft [[autocannon]]s (mounted on [[Technical (vehicle)|technicals]], M35A1/A2 trucks and M113 APCs)&lt;ref&gt;Kassis, ''30 Years of Military Vehicles in Lebanon'' (2003), pp. 63-65.&lt;/ref&gt; were employed in both [[Anti-aircraft warfare|air defense]] and direct fire supporting roles.

==Administrative organization and illegal activities==
Amal's main sphere of influence encompassed the Shia-populated slum districts located at south-western Beirut of [[Chyah]], [[Bir Abed]], [[Bir Hassan]], [[Ouza'i]], and [[Khalde]], with the latter including the adjoining [[Beirut International Airport|International Airport]], which they brought under their control in late February 1984.&lt;ref&gt;O'Ballance, ''Civil War in Lebanon'' (1998), p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt;  Outside the Capital, they also operated at [[Baalbek]] and [[Hermel]] in the [[Beqaa Valley|Beqaa]], and in the southern [[Jabal Amel]] region, notably around the port cities of [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]] and [[Sidon]], and in the [[Iqlim al-Tuffah]] region down to the [[UNIFIL]] zone.&lt;ref&gt;Bicard, ''Prospects for Lebanon – The Demobilization of the Lebanese Militias'', p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to Syrian backing, Amal received some financial support from [[Libya]] and [[Iran]] – first by the [[Shah]] in 1975-78, replaced after 1979 by the new Islamic regime{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} – and from the Lebanese Shi'ite immigrant community in [[West Africa]]. Additional revenues came from [[protection racket]]s ([[Arabic language|Arabic]]: ''Khuwa'') imposed on Shia neighborhoods&lt;ref name="Bicard, p. 16"/&gt; and from tolls levied in illegal ports such as Ouza'i in Beirut, along with [[Zahrani]], whose harbour and the adjacent Tapline oil refinery were employed in the contraband of fuel, and [[Sarafand, Lebanon|Sarafand]] (used for smuggling imported cars and other goods), both located south of Sidon.

The Movement had its own civil administration and assistance networks, gathered since the mid-1980s under the authority of the so-called 'Council of the South' ([[Arabic]]: ''Majliss al-Janoub''). Headed by Amal's vice-president [[Muhammad Baydoun]] and based at the Christian town of [[Maghdouché]] near Sidon, it was responsible for running schools, hospitals, and conducting public works on Shia areas.  Amal also run from its headquarters at [[Rue Hamra]], in association with [[Zahir Al-Khatib]]'s [[Toilers League]] a joint television service ([[Arabic]]: ''Al-Machriq'').

==Split with "Islamic Amal"==
In the summer of 1982, [[Husayn Al-Musawi]], deputy head and official spokesman of Amal, broke with Berri over his willingness to go along with U.S. mediation in Lebanon rather than attack Israeli troops, his membership in the National Salvation Council alongside the Christians,&lt;ref&gt;Wright, ''Sacred Rage'' (2001) pp. 61-62.&lt;/ref&gt; and his opposition to pledging allegiance to Ayatollah [[Khomeini]].&lt;ref&gt;Ranstorp, ''Hizb'allah in Lebanon'' (1997), p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

Musawi formed the [[Islamist]] [[Islamic Amal]] Movement, based in [[Baalbeck]]. It was aided by the Islamic Republic of [[Iran]] which, in the wake of the 1979 Islamic Revolution, strove not only to help Lebanon's Shi'a, but to export the [[Pan-Islamism|PanIslamic]] revolution to the rest of the Muslim world, something Musawi strongly supported, saying, "We are her (the Islamic Republic's) children."

&lt;blockquote&gt;We are seeking to formulate an Islamic society which in the final analysis will produce an Islamic state. ... The Islamic revolution will march to liberate Palestine and Jerusalem, and the Islamic state will then spread its authority over the region of which Lebanon is only a part.&lt;ref&gt;Musawi in ''Monday Morning'' magazine, October 31, 1983 shortly before the embassy bombings, quoted in Wright, ''Sacred Rage'' (2001), p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

About 1,500 members of Iran's [[Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps|Islamic Revolutionary Guard]] or Pasdaran, arrived at the  [[Beqaa Valley]] at the time and "directly contributed to ensure the survival and growth of al-Musawi's newly-created small militia," providing training, indoctrination and funding.&lt;ref&gt;Ranstorp, ''Hizb'allah in Lebanon'' (1997) p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; Iran was in many ways a natural ally of Shia in Lebanon as it was far larger than Lebanon, oil-rich, and both Shi'a-majority and Shi'a-ruled. And of course, founder [[Musa al-Sadr]] had come from Iran. Iran's generous funding meant generous pay for the militias recruits—$150–200 per month plus cost-free education and medical treatment for themselves and their families—that "far exceeded what other [Lebanese] militias were able to offer." This was a major incentive among the impoverished Shi'a community, and induced "a sizable number of Amal fighters [to] defected regularly to the ranks" of Islamic Amal, and later Hizb'Allah.&lt;ref&gt;Ranstorp, ''Hizb'allah in Lebanon'' (1997) p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

By August 1983, Islamic Amal and [[Hezbollah]] were "effectively becoming one under the Hezbollah label,"&lt;ref&gt;Wright, ''Sacred Rage'' (2001), p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt; and by late 1984, Islamic Amal, along with "all the known major groups" in Lebanon, had been absorbed into Hezbollah.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, ''Sacred Rage'' (2001), p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Amal militia in the Lebanese civil war==
In March–April 1985, Amal militia forces joined in a Syrian-backed coalition with the [[Popular Nasserist Organization]] (PNO), the [[Al-Mourabitoun]] and the [[Druze in Lebanon|Druze]] [[Progressive Socialist Party]] (PSP) militias, which defeated the Christian [[Lebanese Forces (militia)|Lebanese Forces]] (LF) attempts to establish bridgeheads at [[Damour]] and [[Sidon]].&lt;ref&gt;O'Ballance, ''Civil War in Lebanon'' (1998), p. 156.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The War of the Camps===
{{Main|War of the Camps}}
The War of the Camps was a series of battles in the mid-1980s between Amal and Palestinian groups. The [[Druze]]-oriented [[Progressive Socialist Party]] (PSP) and [[Hezbollah]] supported the Palestinians while Syria backed Amal.

====First battle: May 1985====
Although most of the Palestinian guerrillas were expelled during the [[1982 Lebanon War|1982 Israeli invasion]], Palestinian militias began to regain their footing after the Israeli withdrawal firstly from Beirut, then [[Sidon]] and [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]]. Syria viewed this revival with some anxiety: though in the same ideological camp, Damascus had little control over most Palestinians organizations and was afraid that the build-up of Palestinian forces could lead to a new Israeli invasion. Moreover, Syria's minority [[Alawite]] regime was never comfortable with the Sunni militias in Lebanon, traditionally aligned with Egypt and Iraq. In Lebanon, Shia-Palestinian relations had been very tense since the late 1960s. After the multinational force withdrew from Beirut in February 1984, Amal and the PSP took control of west Beirut and Amal built a number of outposts around the camps (in Beirut but also in the south). On April 15, 1985, Amal and the PSP attacked the [[Al-Mourabitoun]], the main Lebanese [[Sunni Islam in Lebanon|Sunni]] militia and the closest ally of the [[Palestine Liberation Organization|PLO]] in Lebanon. The Al-Mourabitoun forces were vanquished after a week of heavy fighting and their leader, [[Ibrahim Kulaylat]] was sent into exile.&lt;ref&gt;William E. Smith, "Lebanon: A Country's Slow Death", ''Time'', April 29, 1985, p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; On May 19, 1985, heavy fighting erupted between Amal and the Palestinians for the control of the Sabra, Shatila and Burj el-Barajneh camps (all in Beirut). Despite its efforts, Amal could not take the control of the camps. The death toll remains unknown, with estimates ranging from a few hundreds to a few thousands. This and heavy political pressure from the [[Arab League]] led to a cease-fire on June 17.

====Second battle: May 1986====
The situation remained tense and fights occurred again in September 1985 and March 1986. On May 19, 1986, heavy fighting erupted again. Despite new armaments provided by Syria, Amal could not take control of the camps. Many cease-fires were announced, but most of them did not last more than a few days. The situation began to cool after Syria deployed some troops on June 24, 1986.

====Third battle September 1986====
There was tension in the south, an area where Shi'as and Palestinians were both present. This unavoidably led to frequent clashes. On September 29, 1986, fighting erupted at the Rashidiyye refugee camp near Tyre. The conflict immediately spread to Sidon and Beirut. Palestinian forces managed to occupy the Amal-controlled town of [[Maghdouché]] on the eastern hills of Sidon to open the road to Rashidiyye. Syrian forces helped Amal and Israel launched air strikes against PLO position around Maghdouche. A cease-fire was negotiated between Amal and pro-Syrian Palestinian groups on December 15, 1986, but it was rejected by [[Yasser Arafat]]'s [[Fatah]]. Fatah tried to appease the situation by giving some of its positions to Hezbollah and to the Al-Mourabitoun. The situation became relatively calm for a while, but the bombing against the camps continued. In Beirut, a blockade of the camps led to a dramatic shortage of food and medications inside the camps. In early 1987, the fighting spread to Hezbollah and the PSP who supported the Palestinians. The PSP, having won numerous battles, quickly seized large portions of west Beirut. Consequently, Syria occupied west Beirut beginning February 21, 1987. On April 7, 1987, Amal finally lifted the siege and handed its positions around the camps to the Syrian army.  According to the ''[[New York Times]]'' (March 10, 1992, citing figures from the Lebanese police), 3,781 were killed in the fighting.

====February 1988====
[[File:Shiite Muslim AMAL militiaman firing his AK-47 assault rifle during skirmishes with Druze irregulars on Corniche-al-Mazraa road in West Beirut, Lebanon.jpg|alt=Shiite Muslim AMAL militiaman firing his AK-47 assault rifle during skirmishes with Druze irregulars on Corniche-al-Mazraa road in West Beirut, Lebanon|thumb|AMAL militiaman firing his AK-47 assault rifle during skirmishes with Druze PLA irregulars on the Corniche-al-Mazraa road in West Beirut, 10 February 1987.]]

On February 17, 1988, Lt. Col [[William R. Higgins]], American Chief of the [[United Nations Truce Supervision Organization|UNTSO]] observer group in Lebanon, was abducted from his UN vehicle between Tyre and Nakara after a meeting with Abd al-Majid Salah, Amal's political leader in southern Lebanon.  It soon became "clear that Sheikh al-Musawi, the commander to Hezbollah's Islamic Resistance, had been personally responsible for the abduction of Lt. Col Higgins in close cooperation with both Sheikh Abdul Karim Obeid, the local commander of Hizballah's military wing, and Mustafa al-Dirani, the former head of Amal's security service."&lt;ref name="Ranstorp"/&gt;  This is seen as a direct challenge to Amal by Hezbollah, and Amal responds by launching an offensive against Hezbollah in the south where it "scores decisive military victories ... leading to the expulsion of a number of Hizballah clergy to the Beqqa". In Beirut's southern suburbs however, where fighting also raged, Hizballah was much more successful. "[E]lements within Hizballah and the Iranian Pasdaran established a joint command to assassinate high-ranking Amal officials and carry out operations against Amal checkpoints and centers."&lt;ref&gt;Voice of Lebanon, 0615 gmt 18 April 88-BBC/SWB/ME/0131, 21 April 1988; and ''Ha'aretz'', 18 April 1988, quoted in Ranstorp, ''Hizb'allah in Lebanon'' (1997), p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt;

By May, Amal had suffered major losses, its members were defecting to Hezbollah, and by June, Syria had to intervene militarily to rescue Amal from defeat.&lt;ref name="Ranstorp"/&gt;  In January 1989, a truce in the "ferocious" fighting between Hizballah and Amal was arranged by Syrian and Iranian intervention.  "Under this agreement, Amal's authority over the security of southern Lebanon [is] recognized while Hizballah [is] permitted to maintain only a nonmilitary presence through political, cultural, and informational programmes."&lt;ref&gt;Ranstorp, ''Hizb'allah in Lebanon'' (1997), p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disbandement==
Upon the end of the war in October 1990, Amal militia forces operating in the Capital and the Beqaa were ordered in March 1991 to disband and surrender their heavy weaponry, a decision that came a few months after the Movement's leadership had already announced the dissolution of its own military force.&lt;ref name="Bicard, p. 15"/&gt; The Sixth Brigade was re-integrated into the structure of the [[Lebanese Armed Forces]] (LAF) whilst an additional 2,800 ex-Amal militiamen joined the re-formed Lebanese Army in September of the following year.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} Despite the order to disarm, Amal guerrilla units in the south remained in place until the final Israeli pull-out in May 2000. One of their last significant operations was the [[Shayetet 13|Ansariya Ambush]] on September 15, 1997, where Amal commandos under [[Hezbollah]] command successfully ambushed an Israeli [[Shayetet 13]] naval commando force.

'''Les amis du bus des femmes''' is a French association established in 1990 by former [[sex workers]] as a support group for sex workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Deschamps|first=Catherine|title=Femmes publiques: Les féminismes à l'épreuve de la prostitution|year=2009|publisher=Amsterdam|location=Paris|isbn=978-2-915547-08-5|page=92|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VpUnAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22Les+amis+du+bus+des+femmes%22&amp;dq=%22Les+amis+du+bus+des+femmes%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=D_UDUujBFaTuyAGx6IH4AQ&amp;ved=0CFAQ6AEwBTgK|author2=Souryis, Anne }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The original initiative stemmed from a need to educate sex workers on [[AIDS]].&lt;ref name="Égré" /&gt; It quickly became established as a bridging organisation between sex workers on the street and the provision of medical, social and administrative services. Its [[Paris]] headquarters is open daily to the population it serves. In addition it has eight permanent mobile units ([[buses]]) operating day and night in the areas frequented by sex workers in the capital, staffed by organisational and health professionals.&lt;ref name="Égré"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Égré |first1=Pascale |title=Confidences dans le Bus des femmes |url=http://www.leparisien.fr/faits-divers/confidences-dans-le-bus-des-femmes-15-05-2000-2001375118.php |accessdate=12 August 2018 |language=fr |date=May 15, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The principal mission of the association, whose administration consists of both sex workers and non-sex workers, is to work with and for sex workers to prevent [[HIV]], [[hepatitis]] and [[sexually transmitted diseases]]. They distribute condoms and encourage sex workers to visit the office to get help with administrative, medical, and social needs, and conducts job searches for those who decide to transition out of sex work. Emphasis is placed on helping workers access their health, social and human rights. The objective is to enable workers to develop an environment that supports an active role for them in stating their needs and demands. In working with and for sex workers, the association fights against [[discrimination]], [[social exclusion]] and [[human trafficking]].&lt;ref name="Égré" /&gt;&lt;ref name="florian" /&gt;

The association opposes abolitionism and its objective to eradicate sex work, and recognizes that some women have freely chosen to engage in sex work and that that choice must be respected. The association deals with both voluntary and involuntary sex workers, such as those trafficked from Eastern Europe, Africa and Asia.&lt;ref name="florian" /&gt;

Currently the association has fourteen employees including doctors and nurses, facilitators and an employment counsellor. It is funded from government grants which are allocated by agencies such as [[Direction départementale des Affaires sanitaires et sociales|DDASS]] Paris (Direction départementale des Affaires sanitaires et sociales), the Paris [[conseil général]], the CPAM de Paris (Caisse primaire d'assurance maladie) and the [[Conseil régional]].&lt;ref name="florian"&gt;{{cite web |title=Les Amis du bus des femmes |url=http://florian-cabirol.com/bus-des-femmes/qui-sommes-nous/ |website=florian-cabirol.com |accessdate=12 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project also receives funding from the [[European Commission]]'s Daphne Funding Programme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Daphne Toolkit |url=https://ec.europa.eu/justice/grants/results/daphne-toolkit/en/content/la-pr%C3%A9vention-des-violences-faites-aux-femmes-travaillant-dans-le-milieu-de-la-prostitution |publisher=European Commission |accessdate=12 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The association has been politically active, for instance opposing the [[Sarkozy]] laws on solicitation. Claude Boucher appeared for them before the senate hearings.&lt;ref name="allwood08"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Giusta |first1=Ms Marina Della |last2=Munro |first2=Professor Vanessa E. |title=Demanding Sex: Critical Reflections on the Regulation of Prostitution |date=2013 |publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd. |isbn=9781409496175 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=fwkLWu6sq-UC&amp;pg=PA67&amp;source=gbs_toc_r&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="allwood06"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Geetanjali |first1=Gangoli |last2=Nicole |first2=Westmarland |title=International Approaches to Prostitution: Law and Policy in Europe and Asia |date=2006 |publisher=Policy Press |isbn=9781861346728 |page=45 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=rxQKtfQJFr0C&amp;pg=PA45&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=boucher151002&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/12/cr-delf/02-03/c0203002.asp|title=Délégation Aux Droits Des Femmes Et À L'égalité Des Chances Entre Les Hommes Et Les Femmes, Compte Rendu N° 2|author=|date=15 October 2002|work=Assemblée Nationale|accessdate=12 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Luke Day Jr.''' (July 21, 1743 – June 1, 1801) was an American military officer, revolutionary, and farmer, most well known for his leadership role in [[Shays' Rebellion]], for which he was convicted of [[high treason]] and [[capital punishment|sentenced to death]], before being [[pardon]]ed by Governor [[John Hancock]].&lt;ref name="Clark"&gt;{{Cite book |title=West Springfield, Massachusetts: Stories Carved in Stone |author=Clark, Rusty |publisher=Dog Pond Press |year=2004 |pages=56–57 |isbn=978-0975536209 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7BC6laTo4aUC&amp;pg=PA56 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was referred to as the "Master Spirit" of the insurrection, and was only passed over as overall leader in favor of [[Daniel Shays]] due to the perception of overzealousness on his part, by his men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ziOh_B_WyEgC&amp;lpg=PA368&amp;ots=N_GDYmjETD&amp;dq=%22master%20spirit%22%20%22luke%20day%22&amp;pg=PA368#v=onepage&amp;q=%22master%20spirit%22%20%22luke%20day%22&amp;f=false|title=The History of Massachusetts|author=Austin, George Lowell|publisher=B.B. Russell|year=1875|pages=368|isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a lieutenant, and then a [[captain (United States)|captain]], he served for eight years and participated in many key battles of the [[American Revolutionary War]], including the [[Siege of Boston]], [[Invasion of Canada (1775)|Quebec Expedition]], [[Battles of Saratoga]], [[Cherry Valley massacre]], [[Sullivan Expedition]] and [[Siege of Yorktown]]. After the war, he joined the prestigious [[Society of the Cincinnati]], which included the likes of [[George Washington]] and [[Alexander Hamilton]].

== Early life ==
Luke Day Sr. was born July 21, 1743, in what is now [[West Springfield, Massachusetts]], the son of Luke Day, Sr. and Jerusha (Skinner) Day.&lt;ref&gt;"Massachusetts, Springfield Vital Records, 1638–1887," index and images, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/pal:/MM9.1.1/XPJJ-W1M : accessed March 7, 2014), Luke Day, 1743.&lt;/ref&gt; Luke was the eighth of seven siblings, and the oldest son. He was [[infant baptism|christened]] 10 days later at the First Congregational Church.&lt;ref&gt;"Massachusetts, Births and Christenings, 1639–1915," index, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/pal:/MM9.1.1/VQ6D-76R : accessed March 7, 2014), Luke Day.&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 20, 1762, he announced his [[marriage bann|intention of marriage]] to Lydia Kelsey, originally of [[Killingworth, Connecticut|Killingworth Township, Connecticut]], then of [[Westfield, Massachusetts]], daughter of Stephen Kelsey, Jr. and Lydia (Noble) Kelsey, and they married soon after.&lt;ref&gt;"Massachusetts, Springfield Vital Records, 1638–1887," index and images, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/pal:/MM9.1.1/XPNN-7ZN : accessed March 7, 2014), Luke Day and Lydia Kelsey, 1762.&lt;/ref&gt; The Days and Kelseys had ties going back at least to the founding of [[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford, CT]], where Robert Day and William Kelsey were neighbors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://magic.lib.uconn.edu/mash_up/hartford_places.html |title=Hartford, CT Historical Places Map Mash-up |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |year=1838 |website=uconn.edu |publisher=[[University of Connecticut]] |accessdate=March 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Luke and Lydia had ten children, although only five, four sons and a daughter, survived to adulthood.

Luke was referred to as a [[Gentleman]], and was well-educated. He was deeply religious and sought counsel from both his minister and the Bible itself for the grievances of the people. In particular, he was inspired by this Bible passage: {{quotation|Behold the tears of such as were oppressed, and they had no comforter; and on the side of the oppressor there was power. ({{Bibleverse|Ecclesiastes|4:1|KJV}})}}

== Family ==

The Days were one of the most prominent families in West Springfield, holding many positions in the local and state government. His father's cousin, [[Colonel]] Benjamin Day was called "the most prominent man on the west side of the river."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Springfield, 1636–1886: History of Town and City : Including an Account of the Quarter-millennial Celebration at Springfield, Mass., May 25 and 26, 1886 |author=Green, Mason Arnold |publisher=Nichols |year=1888 |page=264 |isbn= |url=https://play.google.com/books/reader?id=vMLAcJjc4p8C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;output=reader&amp;authuser=0&amp;hl=en&amp;pg=GBS.PA263.w.1.1.0.2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to having a successful military career, Benjamin served many terms as a [[Member of Congress|representative]] to the [[General Court of Massachusetts]], and was the first [[moderator (town official)|moderator]] and one of the original [[board of selectmen|selectmen]] of West Springfield. Benjamin also raised ninety pounds for the purchase of arms to be used in the Revolutionary War. Another of his father's cousins, William Day, was a [[sea captain]] and a hero of the [[French and Indian War]] for capturing a French [[admiral]], and was the subject of a painting by [[John Singleton Copley]]. William was a member of the committee that approved the [[Sheffield Declaration]].&lt;ref&gt;James M. Banner, Jr. "Sedgwick, Theodore"; ''[[American National Biography Online]]'', February 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; This William Day is a potential candidate to be the [[William Day (sea captain)|Captain William Day]] who earned Revolutionary War fame as the first American sea captain to be [[Salute#Naval cannon fire|recognized]] by a foreign government (France).

Luke's cousin Josiah owned a [[Josiah Day House|home]], which still stands today as the oldest known brick [[saltbox]]-style house in the country, and serves as a family museum.&lt;ref name=brief&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hampdencountyhistory.com/wspfld/day/index.html|title=Brief History of the Day House|publisher=Hampden County Historical Society|accessdate=2013-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Luke is known to have trained his men in the commons area in front of this house, and it may have even served as his headquarters. Luke's brother-in-law (and first cousin) was [[Justin Morgan]], who developed the [[Morgan horse]] breed and composed music, which survives today. Luke's brother, Thomas, also served in the Revolution as a lieutenant.

== Revolutionary War ==
{{Main article|American Revolutionary War}}
Day, then a [[second lieutenant]] in Captain Enoch Chapin's company of [[minutemen]], marched on [[Boston]] on April 20, 1775, in response to the [[Battles of Lexington and Concord|Lexington Alarm]] of the previous day.  He served in [[Danielson's Regiment]] for the remainder of 1775 during the [[Siege of Boston]].  

On January 1, 1777 he was commissioned a captain in the [[7th Massachusetts Regiment]] and served until his discharge on June 20, 1783.  

He was an original member of the Massachusetts [[Society of the Cincinnati]].

== Shays' Rebellion ==
{{Main article|Shays' Rebellion}}
{{Quote box
 |quote  = It was more the result of accident than any other cause that Shays had the precedence, and the fortune to make his name infamous by association with the rebellion in which he was engaged. Day was the stronger man, in mind and will, the equal of Shays in military skill, and his superior in the gift of speech.
 |source = John H. Lockwood, ''Western Massachusetts: A History: 1636–1925'', volume 1. (New York: Lewis Historical Publishing Company, Inc., 1926), p. 131.
}}

== Later years ==
The Society of the Cincinnati, which he had joined to solidify his legacy, dismissed him as a member on July 13, 1787, due to his involvement in Shays' Rebellion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Massachusetts Society of the Cincinnati |author=Whittemore, Bradford Adams |publisher=Massachusetts Society of the Cincinnati |year=1964 |page=45 |isbn= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w-WiQwAACAAJ&amp;dq=Massachusetts+Society+of+the+Cincinnati+1964&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=98gdU_TzEIeMyAGR9YDwDg&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Luke, Sr. died in 1791, Luke, Jr. was not named in his will. It is not known whether this was due to his participation in the rebellion, or other factors. He was brought to court several times for unpaid [[mortgage loan|mortgage]] debts. Luke was known to have suffered from [[gout]] in his later years, and lived out his life in relative poverty and obscurity.&lt;ref&gt;Swift, West Springfield Massachusetts: A Town History, p.40.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Death ==
On June 1, 1801, shortly before his 58th birthday, Luke died at his home in West Springfield.&lt;ref&gt;"Massachusetts, Deaths and Burials, 1795–1910," index, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/pal:/MM9.1.1/FCMW-R4H : accessed March 7, 2014), Luke Day, June 1, 1801.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to his infamy at the time as leader of Shays' Rebellion, he was buried next to his mother in an [[unmarked grave]] at Paucatuck Cemetery to prevent [[desecration]], and only received a [[headstone]] almost two centuries later, in 1987, via the [[Ramapogue Historical Society]].&lt;ref name="Clark" /&gt;

The '''Ministry of Public Education''' ({{lang-it|Ministero della Pubblica Istruzione}}, or '''MPI''') was the government body of the [[Italian Republic]] devoted to the administration of the national education system in three separate periods (1861-1929; 1944-2001; 2006-2008). In May 2008 it has been merged into the present-day [[Ministry of Education, Universities and Research]] (MIUR).

==History==
Set up in 1861 under the [[Camillo Benso, conte di Cavour|Cavour]] cabinet, it was suppressed on 12 September 1929 by [[Benito Mussolini]]'s cabinet, and replaced by the ''Ministero dell'Educazione Nazionale'' (''Ministry of National Education'').  This name persisted until 29 May 1944 (i.e. until under the second cabinet of [[Pietro Badoglio]]), and the second [[Ivanoe Bonomi]] cabinet had it revert to its original name (''della Pubblica Istruzione'').  

It remained unchanged until 14 December 1974, when [[Giovanni Spadolini]] (then head of government) created the ''[[Ministero per i Beni e le Attività Culturali]]'', which took over responsibilities and functions from this and other ministries.  In 1988, the [[Ministry of Universities and Research|Ministero dell'Università e della Ricerca Scientifica e Tecnologica]] also subsumed some of the education ministry's responsibilities.  In the first [[Romano Prodi]] cabinet the two were merged into the ''Ministero della Pubblica Istruzione, Università, Ricerca Scientifica e Tecnologica'', then the [[Ministero dell'istruzione, dell'università e della ricerca]] (MIUR) in the second and third [[Silvio Berlusconi]] cabinets.  The two were re-separated in the second Prodi cabinet of 17 May 2006, but then re-merged in the fourth Berlusconi cabinet of 7 May 2007.

== Organization ==
At its end in 2007, the Ministry consisted of (2007):
* Uffici per la diretta collaborazione del Ministro
* Dipartimento per l'Istruzione
** D.G. Affari internazionali
** D.G. Istruzione post-secondaria
** D.G. Ordinamenti scolastici

* Dipartimento per la programmazione
** D.G. Comunicazione
** D.G. Politica finanziaria e bilancio

The '''Movement of Free Citizens''' ({{lang-sr|Покрет слободних грађана}}, ПСГ / Pokret slobodnih građana, '''PSG''') is a [[Social democracy|social-democratic]] and [[Social liberalism|social-liberal]] [[List of political parties in Serbia|political movement in Serbia]]. It is a [[centre-left]] political organization in [[Serbia]], founded after [[Serbian presidential election, 2017|2017 presidential elections]], by [[Saša Janković]], who ended up second with nearly 17% of the vote.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://rs.n1info.com/a250316/Vesti/Vesti/Osnovan-pokret-Sase-Jankovica-Slobodni-gradjani-Srbije.html|title=Osnovan pokret Saše Jankovića|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has no representatives in the [[National Assembly (Serbia)|National Assembly]], since it was founded after the last [[Serbian parliamentary election, 2016|parliamentary elections]] in Serbia.

The Movement's organizational structure includes Assembly, Presidency, Main board and Council.

Since its inception it has positioned itself as a major opposition movement to government led by [[Serbian Progressive Party]] (SNS).

== History ==
Saša Janković was in the position of state ombudsman, and as such, he often criticized practices of the government, led by [[Serbian Progressive Party|SNS]] and [[Aleksandar Vučić|Vučić]]. This positioned him among voters as opposition spokesperson and led to him enjoying relatively high ratings in relation to actual opposition leaders and politicians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.blic.rs/vesti/politika/otkrivamo-sta-stoji-iza-kampanje-protiv-ombudsmana-vlast-se-plasi-rejtinga-sase/zj8ybgy|title=Vlast se plaši rejtinga Saše Jankovića|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As his term was about to end, he decided to resign and run in the presidential elections, scheduled for April 2017. His most notable endorsement came from the [[Democratic Party (Serbia)|Democratic Party]], which decided to support Janković, rather than to have a candidate of its own.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.blic.rs/vesti/politika/demokratska-stranka-podrzala-sasu-jankovica-za-predsednika-srbije/e92nk70|title=Demokratska stranka podržala Sašu Jankovića za predsednika Srbije|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This helped him create a relatively united front against Vučić in the upcoming elections.

In the aftermath of the elections, Janković, who finished second with 16.3% of the vote, decided to form his own political movement, rather than joining the Democratic Party. His movement "Apel 100", formed for the purposes of gathering support from intellectuals and other notable citizens for his presidential candidacy, was thereby transformed into a political organization, the Movement of Free Citizens.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Despite competing against each other in the presidential election, Janković's movement now cooperates closely with the [[People's Party (Serbia, 2017)|People's Party]], a party formed by [[Vuk Jeremić]] after the election.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.b92.net/info/vesti/index.php?yyyy=2017&amp;mm=11&amp;dd=11&amp;nav_category=11&amp;nav_id=1324236|title=Narodna stranka i PSG počeli razgovore o saradnji|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the founding members have left the Movement, accusing Janković of running it like his own 'company', and revealed that Janković's wife exerts enormous influence on how the Movement is run.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.politika.rs/sr/clanak/393333/Skoro-Da-sam-znao-samo-pet-odsto-svega-nikad-ne-bih-usao-u-PSG|title=Škoro: Da sam znao samo pet odsto svega, nikad ne bih ušao u PSG (In Serbian)|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the accusations, the Movement's Presidency held an emergency meeting, where Janković offered his resignation, a motion denied by the Presidency.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.021.rs/story/Info/Srbija/176528/Jankovic-ponudio-ostavku-na-mesto-predsednika-PSG-skupstina-odbila.html|title=Janković ponudio ostavku na mesto predsednika PSG, skupština odbila (In Serbian)|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This turmoil within the Movement led political analysts and other opposition leaders and politicians to question the capacity of Janković and the Movement to lead the opposition against Vučić's government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dnevnik.rs/politika/stankovic-jankovic-vise-nije-pouzdanica-opozicije-26-11-2017|title=Janković više nije "pouzdanica" opozicije (In Serbian)|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7572">'''Neopatrimonialism''' is a system of social hierarchy where [[patron]]s use [[State (polity)|state]] [[factors of production|resources]] in order to secure the [[loyalty]] of clients in the general population. It is an informal [[Political clientelism|patron–client]] relationship that can reach from very high up in state structures down to individuals in small villages.

Neopatrimonialism may underlie or supplant the [[bureaucratic]] structure of the state in that only those with connections have the real power, not those who hold higher positions. Further criticisms include that it undermines political institutions and the rule of law, and is a [[Political corruption|corrupt]] (but not always illegal) practice. Neopatrimonialism also has its benefits, however. Neopatrimonialism can extend the reach of the state into the geographical and social peripheries of the country, provide short term stability, and facilitate communal integration.

Neo-patrimonialism, as defined by author Christopher Clapham of ''The Nature of the Third World State'', is a "form of organisation in which relationships of a broadly patrimonial type pervade a political and administrative system which is formally constructed on rational-legal lines". It is a system in which an office of power is used for personal uses and gains, as opposed to a strict division of the private and public spheres.

==Origin and definition of the term==
"Neopatrimonialism" as a distinct term is generally held to have originated with [[Shmuel N. Eisenstadt]], in his 1973 book ''Traditional Patrimonialism and Modern Neopatrimonialism'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
  | last = Eisenstadt
  | first = Shmuel N.

  | isbn = 0-8039-0371-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; deriving it from [[Max Weber]]'s term, '[[patrimonialism]]', who used the latter term to describe a system of rule based on administrative and military personnel, who were responsible only to the ruler. Neo-Patrimonialism, which is a modern form of the traditional Patrimonial form of rule, is a mixed system. Here elements of patrimonial and rational-bureaucratic rule co-exist and are sometimes interwoven.&lt;ref name="GIGA"&gt;{{cite conference

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Application and criticism==
Neopatrimonialism is sometimes used as a way of explaining why African states have "failed" to effect [[neoliberal]] market reforms.&lt;ref name="GIGA" /&gt; This focus is controversial, with some complaining that the term is vague, and others that its use has failed to take into account the politics of non-African states. For example, in 1998 [[Thandika Mkandawire]] said,
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Another problem is that "neo-patrimonial" states in and outside Africa have pursued a wide range of policies including some that are squarely developmental. In other words, other than indicating the style of governance, neo-patrimonialism does not tell us much about what policies a state will pursue and with what success. In the African case "neo-patrimonialism" has been used to explain [[import substitution]], export orientation, [[parastatal]]s, privatization, the [[informal sector]] development, etc. The result is that, in seeking to explain everything, it explains nothing except perhaps that [[capitalism|capitalist]] relations in their idealized form are not pervasive in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Others have argued that the concept is valid and needs refinement. For example, a paper in 2004 identified political difficulties in [[Bangladesh]] as having their origins in the neopatrimonial system that had evolved there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

  | accessdate = 2008-02-03 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Africa==
Nicolas Van de Walle argues that neopatrimonialism is very prevalent in Africa. African regimes are presidential, which facilitates clientelism since power is concentrated in a single individual with ultimate control of networks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Van de Walle|first1=Nicolas|title=Democratic Reform in Africa|date=2005|publisher=Lynne Rienner Publishers|location=United States}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Joel Migdal puts it, the state in African countries seems omnipresent in all aspects of people’s lives, from the very local to the central government levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Migdal|first1=Joel S.|title=Strong societies and weak states: state-society relations and state capabilities in the Third World.|date=1998|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=United States}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Van de Walle introduces the notion that in Africa, states are hybrid regimes where patrimonial practices and bureaucracies coexist to a higher or lesser degree. African states have laws and constitutional order and in parallel are ruled by patrimonial logic in which political authority is based on clientelism and office holders constantly appropriate public resources for their own benefit.  The dual nature of African regimes means that clientelism is not incidental and cannot be easily corrected with capacity building policies and at the same time formal structures play an important role, even in the least-institutionalized states. 

According to Van de Walle, one of the main issues with neopatrionialism is that it undermines economic reform in contemporary Africa on multiple levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Van de Walle|first1=Nicolas|title=Democratic Reform in Africa|date=2005|publisher=Lynne Rienner Publishers|location=United States}}&lt;/ref&gt; Joel Migdal points out that state leaders will fragment power and use different techniques to prevent reform and policy from being implemented in local branches and institutions, as a way to avoid important local agencies to mobilize against the central power. The main goal of central leaders is to avoid losing power and control, even if that means stalling policy implementation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Migdal|first1=Joel S.|title=Strong societies and weak states: state-society relations and state capabilities in the Third World.|date=1998|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=United States}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Original Advocacy''' is a type of [[Speech (public address)|speech]] event practiced in [[California High School Speech Association]] (or CHSSA) event, in which the speaker writes a persuasive speech and delivers it in competition. It is often referred to as 'OA', and is the Californian High School version of persuasive speeches.  The speaker has ten minutes to present a problem, its significance, and a legislative solution to fix the stated problem. The problem is not a general one, such as apathy, but is a more specific one that can be legislated and solved, such as medical malpractice or statutory rape. The speaker should also include some discussion of how the proposed solution will actually solve the problem. However, the legislature included should be plausible and sensible. While the speeches used to be mostly serious in nature, the trend has now changed such that speeches contain more humorous material and even some acting. However, the winning speeches generally stick to the traditional, more analytical way of speaking. One theme that hasn't changed is that speeches generally have very specific topics ranging from domestic issues to international issues.  Generally, the speeches are inspiring and informative.  These speeches should have [[statistics]], numbers, and [[Mathematical proof|proof]] (typically consisting of real stories found in the news) to support the various claims made by the speaker, though many speeches nowadays replace many statistics with jokes. Judges can evaluate this speech on any criteria, but usually the style of delivery (measured by the fluidity of the speech as well as the hand [[gesture]]s, [[eye contact]], memorization, posture, and tone) and content (the proof offered to prove the claims of problems) serve as fair and impartial indicators.

A '''Qualified Intermediary''' refers to a person that acts as an [[intermediary]] qualified under certain sections of the U.S. [[Internal Revenue Code]] (IRC) to undertake specified activities.

==IRC §1031 Qualified Intermediary==
A §1031 Qualified Intermediary (QI), also known as an Accommodator, is a company that facilitates [[Internal Revenue Code section 1031]] tax-deferred exchanges. The role of a QI is defined in Treas. Reg. §1.1031(k)-1(g)(4). Under IRC Section 1031 an owner of business or investment property may exchange that property for other like-kind property within a statutorily mandated period of time, and defer current recognition of gain on the sale of the old property.  

Anyone who is related to the taxpayer, or who has had a financial relationship with the taxpayer (aside from providing routine financial services&lt;ref&gt;26 CFR 1.1031(k)-1(k)(2)(ii)&lt;/ref&gt;) within the two years prior to the close of escrow of the exchange cannot serve as the QI (including employees), unless those services were "[s]ervices for the taxpayer with respect to exchanges of property intended to qualify for nonrecognition of gain or loss under section 1031".&lt;ref&gt;26 CFR 1.1031(k)-1(k)(2)(i)&lt;/ref&gt;  This means that the taxpayer may only use his or her current [[Lawyer|attorney]], [[accountant]], [[investment banker]], [[broker]] or [[real estate agent]] in exceptional circumstances. A QI should be bonded and insured against errors and omissions.  Relevant educational background such as tax, law or finance is desired.  Nevada is the only state that requires a QI to be licensed.

The QI enters into a written agreement with the taxpayer where QI transfers the relinquished property to the buyer, and transfers the replacement property to the taxpayer pursuant to the exchange agreement.  The QI holds the proceeds from the sale of the relinquished property in a trust or escrow account in order to ensure the Taxpayer never has actual or constructive receipt of the sale proceeds. 

When selecting a Qualified Intermediary (QI), it is important to consider the fact that there is little regulation governing these entities. Therefore, conducting due diligence is crucial in order to ensure the exchange funds are being held in a safe manner and the Exchanger's (entity/individual deferring taxes via 1031 Exchange) funds are protected in the event the Qualified Intermediary can't provide the funds at closing. In addition to that, it's important to make sure the QI being used is experienced and understands the tax code thoroughly.

==IRC §1441 Qualified Intermediary==

IRC §1441 et seq. regulates the withholding of income taxes from payments of U.S. source income made to a non-U.S. person.&lt;ref&gt;26 U.S.C. §§1441-1443&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, the U.S. payor must verify the [[Tax Identification Number]] (TIN) of its payees and withhold 30% of this payment if a TIN is not presented.&lt;ref&gt;''e.g.,'' 26 U.S.C. 1441(b)&lt;/ref&gt; A §1441 Qualified Intermediary (QI) is generally a foreign [[bank]] or other foreign financial institution that signs an agreement with the [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS).&lt;ref&gt;''see'' Treas. Reg. §1.1441-1(e)(5)&lt;/ref&gt; Under the agreement, the QI maintains its own records of the U.S. or foreign status of the beneficial owners of the payments and may undertake responsibility for income reporting and tax withholding.&lt;ref&gt;''see'' Rev. Proc. 2000-12, https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/rp-00-12.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The QI agreement is valid for 6 years and the QI entity is subject to an IRS or external audit periodically to confirm compliance with the agreement terms.&lt;ref&gt;''see id.''&lt;/ref&gt; The §1441 QI regime was later supplemented by foreign account reporting requirements under the [[Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act]].

{{property law}}
The vast majority of states in the [[United States]] employ a system of '''recording''' [[legal instrument]]s (otherwise known as [[deeds registration]]) that affect the title of [[real estate]] as the exclusive means for publicly documenting land titles and interests. This system differs significantly from [[land registration]] systems, such as the [[Torrens system]] that have been adopted in a few states. The principal difference is that the recording system does not determine who owns the title or interest involved, which is ultimately determined through litigation in the courts. The system provides a framework for determining who the law will protect in relation to those titles and interests when a dispute arises.

==Creation==
The recording systems are established by state [[statute]].  They usually provide for the office of a recorder in each county or other jurisdiction. The names of these offices are usually the "Recorder of Deeds" or something similar. State statutes also prescribe the following elements:

#What instruments are entitled to be recorded, usually [[deed]]s, [[Mortgage law|mortgages]] (whether or not in the form of deeds of trust), [[lease]]s (usually longer term varieties), [[easement]]s, and [[court order]]s. There is generally added to these a catch-all category of "other instruments affecting the title to real estate."  These statutes also list technical requirements, such as whether acknowledgements before a [[notary public]] are required (the great majority) or witnesses must also sign the document (rarer).
#The effect of failure to record.  This is usually stated:  Deeds (etc.) that are not recorded are void as against purchasers for valuable [[Consideration under American law|consideration]] without knowledge of their existence.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, California, [[California Civil Code|Civil Code]] Sec. 1214; Colorado, [[Colorado Revised Statutes|CRS]] Sec. 38-35-109; Florida, [[Florida Statutes|Florida Stats.]] Title XL Chapter 695.01(1); Illinois, {{ILCS|765|5|30}}; New York, [[NYS Consolidated Laws]], Art. 9 Sec. 291; and Texas, Property Code Ch. 13, Sec. 13.001(a).&lt;/ref&gt;
#The procedure for indexing instruments presented for recording.

::'''Grantor-grantee indices.'''  Overwhelmingly, this is the creation of an index based on the names of the grantors (the persons conveying the interest) and of the grantees (those receiving the interest).  This is called the [[grantor-grantee index]].  Also included are the dates the instruments are recorded.  Many, if not most, such systems keep separate indexes for deeds and mortgages.  There are also systems for indexing judgment liens in which the judgment debtor and the judgment creditor are listed in the same way as grantors and grantees, respectively.

::'''Tract indices.''' A few state laws require the creation of a [[tract indexes|tract index]].&lt;ref&gt;As of 1988, examples are Iowa, Louisiana, Nebraska, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Utah, Wisconsin and Wyoming - Kratovil and Werner, ''Modern Real Estate Law'', 9th Ed., Prentice-Hall, Inc., (1988) Sec. 9.09&lt;/ref&gt;  This requires the employees in the recorder's office to make a determination of which property is affected by the instrument and to index it by the legal description of that property.  This is not widely practiced because of the increased cost, the greater probability of error and, possibly, the abstractors' and title insurers' lobbies in the legislatures. (Abstractors and title insurers have spent vast amounts of money creating "title plants" that reindex the recorded documents according to the tracts they affect for greater efficiency in title searching.)

==Title searching==
=== Grantor/Grantee ===
A Grantor/Grantee title search attempts to locate records by searching the parties listed on a recorded instrument. One approach to conducting a full Grantor/Grantee title search starts by searching the grantor index in the County records and determining the name of the first recorded owner of title. This is usually the sovereign, which is the Federal Government or the Crown of the nation which owned a former colony now located within the United States. The search finds the grant from the sovereign to the first grantee. This is usually in the form of a patent. Then, the grantee's name is searched in the grantor index to find the deed by which it has subsequently conveyed the title, and so forth until no more grants are found. Liens or encumbrances granted by any of the parties shown on recorded instruments are also found in the search. Though theoretically accurate, this approach has practical difficulties due to there often being numerous grants from the sovereign. Therefore, an alternative method is to reverse the process, i.e. to search backward in the grantee index. This is done by beginning with the name of the person or entity who is thought to own the land to find the grantor to it. Then the grantee index is searched again to find the source of that grantor's title, and so on until you reach the grant from the sovereign. These linkages from grantor to grantee are called the "[[chain of title]]." The last grantee found is the "record title holder."&lt;ref&gt;For further explanation and examples, see ''Ibid'' Sec. 9.08&lt;/ref&gt;

===Geographic Index===
In municipalities with a large population and states that do not support [[tract index|tract indices]], the Grantor/Grantee method can be time consuming and difficult altogether due to common names within the index. In these municipalities, a geographic index is often created to aid in title searching. In this system, each document is posted in both a Grantor and Grantee index in addition to being posted to indexes describing attributes of the property's location such as a lot number, subdivision name or Parcel Identification Number (PIN). With a functioning geographic index, a search can be done with a combination of a Grantor/Grantee, Legal Description or PIN search.

==How the system works==
The record title holder is not necessarily the actual owner of the land if there are previous unrecorded deeds to it to others.  The principal legal theory is that once a person has conveyed the title to his or her property (or some aspect of it) to someone, he or she has nothing left to transfer to any subsequent person. However, as a result of the various state '''recording acts''', the courts will protect a [[bona fide purchaser]] who pays valuable [[Consideration under American law|consideration]] and doesn't have knowledge of the prior unrecorded deed from the claims of a prior grantee under that deed.  The same is true respecting most types of unrecorded liens or encumbrances.  For example, purchasers of the land from the record title holder who pay valuable consideration and have no knowledge of unrecorded mortgages will be protected against those mortgages by the courts.  All of this flows from the statement in most recording statutes that the unrecorded instruments are void against such purchasers.  Also, U.S. law permits the bankruptcy trustee of a debtor to set aside property interests the debtor has conveyed if a bona fide purchaser of the real estate, who properly perfected its interest, would be protected against the conveyance.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. 544(3).  The usual reason why a bona fide purchaser would be protected is because it has no notice of the conveyance because it has not been recorded.  Also, a lack of prompt recording of the transfer may create an [[unfair preference]] under some circumstances pursuant to 11 U.S.C. 547.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, it behooves purchasers and mortgage lenders to record their deeds or mortgages, respectively, to prevent this outcome.

Once an instrument affecting the title to real estate has been recorded, the law holds that everyone is deemed to know of its existence, even if they haven't searched the records in the recorder's office.  This is the doctrine of "[[constructive notice]]" and it is nearly universal in the various states of the U.S.  So, for example, after a deed or mortgage has been recorded by someone in the chain of title, no subsequent purchaser will be protected against it. The reason is that the recording laws deem everyone to know of its existence once it is recorded.

===Effect of the recording act===
Each U.S. state has a recording act, a [[statute]] which dictates the [[legal procedure]] by which an individual claiming an interest in [[real property]] (real estate) formally establishes their claim to that property. The recordation of property rights becomes particularly significant where an unscrupulous dealer in land purports to sell the same tract of land multiple times. With other kinds of property, the first buyer would be the owner of the property, and later owners would have no interest in the property and would instead have a cause of action against the original seller for fraud. With real property, however, the first buyer is not necessarily the owner, depending on the kind of statute under which the recording of such property interests operates. There are three basic kinds of statutory schemes in recording acts: race, notice, and race/notice.

Even though a recording act does not require recordation, the law does create strong incentive for a buyer to record. Recordation provides constructive notice to any subsequent purchasers that a prior conveyance occurred and therefore protects the prior purchaser in the event of a subsequent conveyance.

====Race statutes====
Under a '''race statute''', whoever records first wins. Thus, if Oscar purports to sell a piece of land to Al for $100,000, and the next day purports to sell exactly the same piece of land to Bob for another $100,000, then whichever of the two buyers is the first to reach the recording office and have the sale recorded will be deemed the owner of the property. Thus, if Bob is the first to record the conveyance, he will be the owner even if he knew about the prior conveyance to Al. Race statutes are extremely rare because it is generally viewed as unfair to protect a party who had actual notice of a prior conveyance. Currently, [[Delaware]], [[North Carolina]], and [[Louisiana]] are the only jurisdictions where a race statute is in effect.  The benefit of a pure '''race statute''' is that it encourages all grantees to record their interest quickly.

====Notice statutes====
Under a '''notice statute''', a subsequent purchaser for value wins if, at the time of conveyance, that subsequent purchaser had no actual or constructive notice of the prior conveyance.  In short, a subsequent [[bona fide purchaser]] wins. Thus, if Oscar purports to sell a piece of land to Al for $100,000, and the next day purports to sell exactly the same piece of land to Bob for another $100,000, then Bob will own the land so long as he was not aware of the prior sale to Al. However, note that if Al ''records'' his interest before Bob's purchase, this recordation will be deemed to give Bob constructive notice. If Bob purchases the land without notice, and Al then ''records'' his prior purchase before Bob records his own purchase, then Bob will still prevail in ownership of the land.  The benefit of a pure '''notice statute''' is that it encourages Al to record quickly, but if Al records after Bob's purchase, Bob has only limited incentive to record his conveyance immediately.  This can leave the land records incomplete for an indeterminate amount of time and could cause Al to make improvements of which he might be divested by Bob's later recorded deed.

====Race/notice statutes====
Under a '''race/notice statute''', a subsequent purchaser for value wins if (1) at the time of conveyance, that subsequent purchaser had no actual or constructive notice of the prior conveyance, and (2) the subsequent purchaser records before the prior purchaser.  In short, a subsequent purchaser in good faith wins only if he records before the prior purchaser does. In this type of system, if Oscar purports to sell a piece of land to Al for $100,000, and the next day purports to sell exactly the same piece of land to Bob for another $100,000, then Bob will own the land only if he was not aware of the prior sale to Al, ''and'' if Bob actually records his interest before Al does.  In the hybrid '''race/notice statute''', all grantees have a strong incentive to record early, thereby making the land records complete.

==Limitations==
As can be seen from the foregoing, there are limitations to the protection of most recording laws. Persons who don't pay valuable consideration for their interest in the property are not protected against unrecorded interests. Examples are persons getting the property as a gift and heirs. Neither are persons who purchase ownership interests in the ''owners'' of the property, e.g., shares of stock in a corporation owning the land, because they haven't purchased an interest in the property itself.  Also, the recording laws generally do not protect purchasers against real estate taxes because notice of them is usually not required to be recorded for them to be effective. Finally, certain classes of nongovernmental liens such as mechanic's liens are often made effective for a certain period of time even though unrecorded. This list is not exhaustive.

Some types of resistant starch (RS1, RS2 and RS3) are fermented by the large intestinal [[microbiota]], conferring benefits to human health through the production of [[short-chain fatty acid]]s, increased bacterial mass, and promotion of [[butyrate]]-producing bacteria.&lt;ref name="Brouns butyrate review"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Brouns |first1=Fred |last2=Kettitz |first2=Bernd|last3=Arrigoni|first3=Eva|title=Resistant starch and "the butyrate revolution"|journal=Trends in Food Science &amp; Technology |date=2002 |volume=13 |issue=8 |pages=251–261|doi=10.1016/S0924-2244(02)00131-0|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924224402001310}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin and history ==
The concept of resistant starch arose from research in the 1970s&lt;ref name="Birkett 2007 Review"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Birkett|first1=A. M.|last2=Brown|first2=I. L.|title=Chapter 4: Resistant Starch and Health in Technology of Functional Cereal Products|date=2007|publisher=Woodhead Publishing Limited|location=Boca Raton, Florida, USA|isbn=978-1-84569-177-6|pages=63–85}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is currently considered to be one of three starch types: rapidly digested starch, slowly digested starch and resistant starch,&lt;ref name="Sajilata Review"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sajilata|first1=M. G.|last2=Singhal |first2=Rekha S.|last3=Kulkarni |first3=Pushpa R.|title=Resistant Starch – A Review|journal=Comprehensive Reviews in Food Science and Food Safety|date=January 2006|volume=5 |issue=1|pages=1–17 |doi=10.1111/j.1541-4337.2006.tb00076.x |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1541-4337.2006.tb00076.x/epdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Englyst Starch Classification"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Englyst|first1=H.

The [[European Commission]] has supported research eventually leading to a definition of resistant starch.&lt;ref name="Birkett 2007 Review" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Asp EURESTA Review"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Asp|first1=N.-G.|last2=van Amelsvoort|first2=J. M. M.|last3=Hautvast|first3=J. G. A. J.|title=Nutritional Implications of Resistant Starch|journal=Nutrition Research Reviews|date=1996|volume=9 |pages=1–31|doi=10.1079/NRR19960004 |pmid=19094263|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=593924&amp;fileId=S0954422496000054}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Health effects ==
Resistant starch does not release glucose within the small intestine, but rather reaches the large intestine where it is consumed or fermented by colonic bacteria (gut microbiota).&lt;ref name="Sharma review" /&gt; On a daily basis, human intestinal microbiota encounter more carbohydrates than any other dietary component. This includes resistant starch, non-starch [[polysaccharide]] fibers, [[oligosaccharide]]s, and simple sugars which have significance in colon health.&lt;ref name="Sharma review" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bird review" /&gt;

The fermentation of resistant starch produces [[short-chain fatty acid]]s, including [[acetate]], [[propionate]], and [[butyrate]] and increased bacterial cell mass. The short-chain fatty acids are produced in the large intestine where they are rapidly absorbed from the colon, then are metabolized in colonic epithelial cells, liver or other tissues.&lt;ref name=Pryde&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pryde|first1=Susan E.|last2=Duncan|first2=Sylvia H.|last3=Hold|first3=Georgina L. |last4=Stewart|first4=Colin S.|last5=Flint|first5=Harry J. |title=The microbiology of butyrate formation in the human colon|journal=FEMS Microbiology Letters |date=2002 |volume=217|issue=2|pages=133–139|doi=10.1111/j.1574-6968.2002.tb11467.x|url=http://femsle.oxfordjournals.org/femsle/217/2/133.full.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Andoh&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Andoh|first1=Akira|last2=Tsujikawa|first2=Tomoyuki|last3=Fujiyama|first3=Yoshihide|title=Role of Dietary Fiber and Short-Chain Fatty Acids in the Colon|journal=Current Pharmaceutical Design |date=2003 |volume=9 |issue=4 |pages=347–358 |doi=10.2174/1381612033391973#sthash.qj0Z0Y5o.dpuf |url=http://www.eurekaselect.com/63707/article}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fermentation of resistant starch produces more butyrate than other types of dietary fibers.&lt;ref name="Cummings 2001"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cummings|first1=John H.|last2=Macfarlane|first2=George T.|last3=Englyst|first3=Hans N.|title=Prebiotic digestion and fermentation|journal=Am J Clin Nutr|date=2001|volume=73|issue=suppl|page=415S-20S|pmid=11157351|url=http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/73/2/415s.short}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modest amounts of gases such as carbon dioxide, methane, and hydrogen are also produced in intestinal fermentation. One review estimated that the acceptable daily intake of resistant starch may be as high as 45 grams in adults,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Grabitske| first1=HA| last2=Slavin| first2=JL| title=Gastrointestinal effects of low-digestible carbohydrates| journal=Critical Reviews in Food Science and Nutrition| date=2009| volume=49| issue=4| pages=327–360| doi=10.1080/10408390802067126| pmid=19234944|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10408390802067126}}&lt;/ref&gt; an amount exceeding the total recommended intake for dietary fiber of 25–38 grams per day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iom.nationalacademies.org/Reports/2002/Dietary-Reference-Intakes-for-Energy-Carbohydrate-Fiber-Fat-Fatty-Acids-Cholesterol-Protein-and-Amino-Acids.aspx|title=Dietary Reference Intakes for Energy, Carbohydrate, Fiber, Fat, Fatty Acids, Cholesterol, Protein, and Amino Acids|publisher=Institute of Medicine, US National Academy of Sciences|date=2013|accessdate=30 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; When isolated resistant starch is used to substitute for flour in foods, the [[glycemic]] response of that food is reduced.&lt;ref name="Ashwar Review" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lockyer review"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lockyer|first1=S.|last2=Nugent|first2=A.P.|title=Health effects of resistant starch|journal=Nutrition Bulletin|date=2017|pages=1–32|doi=10.1111/nbu.12244|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/nbu.12244|volume=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] approved a qualified [[health claim]] stating that resistant starch might reduce the risk of [[type 2 diabetes]], but with qualifying language for product labels that limited scientific evidence exists to support this claim. Because ''qualified'' health claims are issued when the science evidence is weak or not consistent, the FDA requires specific labeling language, such as the guideline concerning resistant starch: "High-amylose maize resistant starch may reduce the risk of Type 2 diabetes. FDA has concluded that there is limited scientific evidence for this claim."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.regulations.gov/docket?D=FDA-2015-Q-2352|title=Letter announcing decision for a health claim for high-amylose maize starch (containing type-2 resistant starch) and reduced risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (Docket Number FDA-2015-Q-2352)|last=Balentine|first=Douglas|date=13 Dec 2016|website=www.regulations.gov|publisher=U.S. Food and Drug Administration|access-date=2016-12-16|quote=there is limited credible scientific evidence for a qualified health claim for high-amylose maize resistant starch and reduced risk of type 2 diabetes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foodingredientsfirst.com/news/FDA-Approve-Claim-That-High-Amylose-Maize-Resistant-Starch-Reduces-Type-2-Diabetes-Risk?frompage=news|title=FDA Approve Claim That High-Amylose Maize Resistant Starch Reduces Type 2 Diabetes Risk|publisher=Food Ingredients, CNS Media BV, Arnhem, The Netherlands|date=19 December 2016|accessdate=9 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Starch structure ==
Plants produce starch with different types of structure and shape characteristics which may affect digestion. For instance, smaller starch granules are more available to enzyme digestion because the larger percentage of surface area increases the enzyme binding rate.&lt;ref name="Zaman Review"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zaman|first1=Siti A.|last2=Sarbini|first2=Shahrui R.|title=The Potential of Resistant Starch as a Prebiotic|journal=Critical Reviews in Biotechnology|date=2015|volume=36|pages=1–7|doi=10.3109/07388551.2014.993590|pmid=25582732|url=http://informahealthcare.com/doi/abs/10.3109/07388551.2014.993590}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starch consists of [[amylose]] and [[amylopectin]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=AACC|title=Starch Structure in "Starches"|date=1999|publisher=American Association of Cereal Chemists|location=St. Paul, Minnesota, USA|isbn=1-891127-01-2 |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1094/1891127012.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; which affect the textural properties of manufactured foods. Starches with high amylose content generally have increased resistant starch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Berry|first1=C. S.|title=Resistant starch: Formation and measurement of starch that survives exhaustive digestion with amylolytic enzymes during the determination of dietary fibre|journal=Journal of Cereal Science |date=1986|volume=4|issue=4 |pages=301–314 |doi=10.1016/S0733-5210(86)80034-0|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0733521086800340}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition and categorization ==
Resistant starch (RS) is any starch or starch digestion products that are not digested and absorbed in the [[stomach]] or [[small intestine]] and pass on to the [[large intestine]]. RS has been categorized into four types:&lt;ref name="Sajilata Review" /&gt;

* '''RS1''' – Physically inaccessible or undigestible resistant starch, such as that found in seeds or legumes and unprocessed whole grains.
* '''RS2''' – Resistant starch is inaccessible to enzymes due to starch conformation, as in green bananas and high [[amylose]] corn starch
* '''RS3''' – Resistant starch that is formed when starch-containing foods are cooked and cooled, such as pasta. Occurs due to [[Retrogradation (starch)|retrogradation]], which refers to the collective processes of dissolved starch becoming less soluble after being heated and dissolved in water and then cooled.
* '''RS4''' – Starches that have been chemically [[modified starch|modified]] to resist digestion

==Processing effects==
Processing may affect the natural resistant starch content of foods.  In general, processes that break down structural barriers to digestion reduce resistant starch content, with greater reductions resulting from processing.&lt;ref name="Finocchiaro review"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Finocchiaro|first1=E.

Other types of processing increase resistant starch content. If cooking includes excess water, the starch is gelatinized and becomes more digestible. However, if these starch gels are then cooled, they can form starch crystals resistant to digestive enzymes (Type RS3 or retrograded resistant starch),&lt;ref name="Sajilata Review" /&gt; such as those occurring in cooked and cooled cereals or potatoes (e.g., potato salad).&lt;ref name="Fuentes Review"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fuentes-Zaragoza|first1=E.|last2=Riquelme-Navarrete|first2=M.

The Institute of Medicine Panel on the Definition of Dietary Fiber proposed two definitions: functional fiber as "isolated, nondigestible carbohydrates that have beneficial physiological effects in humans", and dietary fiber as "nondigestible carbohydrates and lignin that are intrinsic and intact in plants."  They also proposed that the prior classifications of soluble versus insoluble be phased out and replaced with viscous versus fermentable for each specific fiber.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2007/11/02/07-5440/food-labeling-revision-of-reference-values-and-mandatory-nutrients |title=Federal Register &amp;#124; Food Labeling: Revision of Reference Values and Mandatory Nutrients |date=2 November 2007 |accessdate=Mar 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Uses ==
===In food===
Starch has been consumed by people and animals for thousands of years.  Thus, foods containing resistant starch are already commonly consumed.

It has been estimated that average resistant starch intake in developed countries ranges from 3–6 grams/day for Northern Europeans, Australians and Americans,&lt;ref name="Birkett 2007 Review" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fuentes Review" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Baghurst Review"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baghurst |first1=P.

Several studies have found that the traditional African diet is high in resistant starch.&lt;ref name="Bird review"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bird|first1=A.|last2=Conlon|first2=M.|last3=Christophersen|first3=C.|last4=Topping|first4=D.|title=Resistant starch, large bowel fermentation and a broader perspective of prebiotics and probiotics|journal=Beneficial Microbes|date=2010|volume=1|issue=4|pages=423–431|doi=10.3920/BM2010.0041|url=http://www.wageningenacademic.com/doi/abs/10.3920/BM2010.0041}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rural black South Africans consume an average of 38 grams of resistant starch per day by having cooked and cooled corn porridge and beans in their diets.&lt;ref name="O'Keefe"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=O'Keefe|first1=Stephen J.

===Isolated===
Isolated and extracted resistant starch and foods rich in resistant starch have been used to fortify foods to increase their dietary fiber content.&lt;ref name="Fuentes Review" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Baghurst Review"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sayago Review"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sayago-Ayerdi|first1=S.

Resistant starch has a small particle size, white appearance, bland flavor and low water-holding capacity.&lt;ref name="Sajilata Review" /&gt; Resistant starch typically replaces flour in foods such as bread and other baked goods, pasta, cereal and batters because it can produce foods with similar color and texture of the original food.&lt;ref name="Raigond Review"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Raigond |first1=P. |last2=Ezekiel |first2=R. |last3=Raigond |first3=B. |title=Resistant Starch in Food: A Review|journal=Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture|date=2014|volume=Epub 21 Oct 2014|doi=10.1002/jsfa.6966|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jsfa.6966|pages=1968–1978}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been used for its textural properties in imitation cheese.&lt;ref name="Homayouni review"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Homayouni |first1=Aziz|last2=Amini |first2=Amir |last3=Keshtiban |first3=Ata Khodavirdivand |last4=Mortazavian |first4=Amir Mohammad |last5=Esazadeh |first5=Karim |last6=Pourmoradian |first6=Samira |title=Resistant starch in food industry: A changing outlook for consumer and producer|journal=Starch – Stärke |date=2014 |volume=66 |issue=1–2 |pages=102–114 |doi=10.1002/star.201300110|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/star.201300110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some types of resistant starch are used as dietary supplements in the United States. RS2 from potato starch and green banana starch maintain their resistance as long as they are consumed raw and unheated. If they are heated or baked, these types of starch may become rapidly digestible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Evans|first1=I. D.|last2=Haisman|first2=D.

In a few cases the ''sanjak-bey'' was himself directly answerable to [[Istanbul]].

Like other early Ottoman administrative offices, the ''sanjak-bey'' had a military origin: the term ''sanjak'' (and ''liva'') means "flag" or "standard" and denoted the insigne around which, in times of war, the cavalrymen holding fiefs (''[[timar]]s'' or ''[[ziamet]]s'') in the specific district gathered. The ''sanjkabey'' was in turn subordinate to a ''beylerbey'' ("Bey of Beys") who governed an ''[[eyalet]]'' and commanded his subordinate ''sanjak-beys'' in war. In this way, the structure of command on the battlefield resembled the hierarchy of provincial government.&lt;ref name=Imber&gt;{{cite web|last=Imber|first=Colin|title=The Ottoman Empire, 1300-1650: The Structure of Power|url=http://www.fatih.edu.tr/~ayasar/HIST236/Colin%20_Imber.pdf|year=2002|pages=177–200|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140726115700/http://www.fatih.edu.tr/~ayasar/HIST236/Colin%20_Imber.pdf|archivedate=2014-07-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The office of ''sanjak-bey'' resembled that of the ''beylerbey'' on a more modest scale. Like the ''beylerbey'', the ''sanjak-bey'' drew his income from a prebend, which consisted usually of revenues from the towns, quays and ports within the boundary of his ''sanjak''.&lt;ref name=Imber /&gt; Within his own sanjak, a governor was responsible above all for maintaining order and, with the cooperation of the fief holders, arresting and punishing wrongdoers. For this, he usually received half of the fines imposed on miscreants, with the fief holder on whose lands the misdeed took place, receiving the other half. ''Sanjak'' governors also had other duties, for example, the pursuit of bandits, the investigation of heretics, the provision of supplies for the army, or the despatch of materials for shipbuilding, as the sultan commanded.&lt;ref name=Imber /&gt;

[[File:Shalom.png|thumb|right|250px|''Shalom'' in Hebrew]]
'''''Shalom''''' ({{lang-he-n|שָׁלוֹם}} ''shalom''; also spelled as ''sholom'', ''sholem'', ''sholoim'', ''shulem'') is a [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] word meaning ''peace'', ''harmony'', ''wholeness'', ''completeness'', ''prosperity'', ''welfare'' and ''tranquility'' and can be used idiomatically to mean both ''hello'' and ''goodbye''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jpost.com/Jewish-World/Jewish-Features/Glamour-of-Grammar-Shalom-aleichem Glamour of the Grammar] in the [http://www.jpost.com Jerusalem Post]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cf.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?Strongs=H07965&amp;Version=kjv|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120711031235/http://cf.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?Strongs=H07965&amp;Version=kjv|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2012-07-11|title=Blue Letter Bible|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblestudytools.net/Lexicons/Hebrew/heb.cgi?search=H7999&amp;version=kjv|title=Old Testament Hebrew Lexicon|website=Bible Study Tools}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As it does in [[English language|English]], it can refer to either [[peace]] between two entities (especially between man and God or between two countries), or to the well-being, welfare or safety of an individual or a group of individuals. The word shalom is also found in many other expressions and names. Its equivalent [[cognate]] in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] is ''[[S-L-M|salaam]]'', ''[[sliem]]'' in [[Maltese language|Maltese]], [[Shlama]] in [[Syriac language|Syriac-Assyrian]] and ''sälam'' in [[Ethiopian Semitic languages]] from the Proto-Semitic [[Root (linguistics)|root]] [[Š-L-M]].

==Etymology==
{{unsourced section|date=December 2016}}
In Hebrew, words are built on "roots", generally of three consonants. When the root consonants appear with various vowels and additional letters, a variety of words, often with some relation in meaning, can be formed from a single root. Thus from the root ''sh-l-m'' come the words ''shalom'' ("peace, well-being"), ''hishtalem'' ("it was worth it"), ''shulam'' ("was paid for"), ''meshulam'' ("paid for in advance"), ''mushlam'' ("perfect"), and ''shalem'' ("whole").

In translations of the Bible, ''shalom'' may be translated as ''peace'' (English), ''paz'' (Spanish and Portuguese), ''paix'' (French), ''pace'' (Italian), or ''pax'' (Latin). The concept of peace is important in Christianity.

Biblically, ''shalom'' is seen in reference to the well-being of others (Genesis 43:27, Exodus 4:18), to treaties (I Kings 5:12), and in prayer for the wellbeing of cities or nations (Psalm 122:6, Jeremiah 29:7). 

The meaning of completeness, central to the term ''shalom'', can also be confirmed in related terms found in other Semitic languages. The Assyrian term ''salamu'' means to be complete, unharmed, paid/atoned. ''Sulmu'', another Assyrian term, means welfare. A closer relation to the idea of ''shalom'' as concept and action is seen in the Arabic root ''salaam'', meaning to be safe, secure and forgiven, among other things.

==In expressions==
The word "shalom" can be used for all parts of speech; as a noun, adjective, verb, adverb, and interjection. It categorizes all shaloms. The word ''shalom'' is used in a variety of expressions and contexts in Hebrew speech and writing:

* ''[[Jewish greetings#Greetings and farewells|Shalom]]'' by itself is a very common abbreviation and it is used in Modern Israeli Hebrew as a [[Jewish greetings|greeting]], to which the common reply is, ''Shalom, Shalom''. It is also used as a farewell. In this way it is similar to the Hawaiian ''[[aloha]]'', the English ''[[good evening]]'' and the Indian ''[[namaste]]''. Also in [[Israel]], "bye" (English) and "yallah bye" (a mixture of [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and English) is popular. ''Shalom'' is also used by Jewish people around the world, and even by many non-Jewish people.
* ''[[Shalom aleichem]]'' ({{Hebrew|שָׁלוֹם עֲלֵיכֶם}}; "well-being be upon you" or "may you be well"), this expression is used to greet others and is a Hebrew equivalent of "hello". Also, for example: "shabat shalom!" The appropriate response to such a greeting is "upon you be well-being" ( עֲלֵיכֶם שָׁלוֹם, ''aleichem shalom''). This is a cognate of the Arabic ''[[Assalamu alaikum]]''. On Erev [[Shabbat]] (Sabbath eve), Jewish people have a custom of singing a song which is called [[Shalom aleichem (liturgy)|Shalom aleichem]], before the [[Kiddush]] over wine of the [[Shabbat dinner]] is recited.
* In the [[Gospels]], [[Jesus]] often uses the greeting "Peace be unto you" (e.g., Matt 10:12), a translation of ''shalom aleichem''. See [[Pax (liturgy)]].
* ''[[Jewish greetings#Shabbat|Shabbat shalom]]'' ({{Hebrew|שַׁבָּת שָׁלוֹם}}) is a common greeting used on [[Shabbat]]. This is most prominent in areas with [[Mizrahi Jews|Mizrahi]], [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardi]], or modern [[Israel]]i influence. Many [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazi]] communities in the Jewish diaspora use [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] ''Gut shabbes'' in preference or interchangeably.
* ''Ma sh'lom'cha'' ({{Hebrew|מַה שְׁלוֹמְךָ}}; "what is your well-being/peace?") is a Hebrew equivalent of the English "how are you?". This is the form addressed to an individual male. The form for addressing an individual female is ''Ma sh'lomech?'' For addressing several females, ''Ma sh'lomchen?'' For a group of males or a mixed-gender group, ''Ma sh'lomchem?''
* ''[[Honorifics for the dead in Judaism|Alav hashalom]]'' ({{Hebrew|עָלָיו הַשָּׁלוֹם}}; "upon him is peace") is a phrase used in some Jewish communities, especially Ashkenazi ones, after mentioning the name of a deceased respected individual.
* ''Oseh shalom'' is the part of a passage commonly found as a concluding sentence in much [[Jewish prayer|Jewish liturgy]] (including the ''[[Birkat Hamazon|birkat hamazon]]'', ''[[kaddish]]'' and personal ''[[amidah]]'' prayers). The full sentence is {{Hebrew|עוֹשֶׂה שָׁלוֹם בִּמְרוֹמָיו, הוּא יַעֲשֶׂה שָׁלוֹם עַלֵינוּ, וְעַל כָּל יִשְׂרָאֵל וְאִמְרוּ אָמֵן}} (''Oseh shalom bimromav, hu ya'aseh shalom aleynu, ve'al kol Yisrael ve'imru [[amen]]''), which translates to English as "He who makes peace in His heights may He make peace upon us and upon all Israel; and say, Amen." It originates from [[Book of Job|Job 25:2]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Machzor Ruach Chadashah |editor=Rabbis Drs. Andrew Goldstein &amp; Charles H Middleburgh |publisher=[[Liberal Judaism (United Kingdom)|Liberal Judaism]] |year=2003 |language=English, Hebrew}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Bill Clinton]] ended his [[eulogy]] for [[Yitzhak Rabin]] with the words ''Shalom, chaver'' (Goodbye, friend).

==Jewish religious principle==
In [[Judaism]], Shalom (peace), is one of the underlying principles of the [[Torah]]: "Her ways are pleasant ways and all her paths are shalom (peace)".&lt;ref&gt;Proverbs 3:17&lt;/ref&gt;" The Talmud explains, "The entire Torah is for the sake of the ways of shalom".&lt;ref&gt;Talmud, Gittin 59b&lt;/ref&gt; [[Maimonides]] comments in his [[Mishneh Torah]]: "Great is peace, as the whole Torah was given in order to promote peace in the world, as it is stated, 'Her ways are pleasant ways and all her paths are peace'".&lt;ref&gt;Maimonides, Mishneh Torah, The Laws of Chanukah 4:14&lt;/ref&gt;

In the book ''Not the Way It's Supposed to Be: A Breviary of Sin'', author [[Cornelius Plantinga]] described the Old Testament concept of shalom:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The webbing together of God, humans, and all creation in justice, fulfillment, and delight is what the Hebrew prophets call shalom. We call it peace but it means far more than mere peace of mind or a cease-fire between enemies. In the Bible, shalom means universal flourishing, wholeness and delight – a rich state of affairs in which natural needs are satisfied and natural gifts fruitfully employed, a state of affairs that inspires joyful wonder as its Creator and Savior opens doors and welcomes the creatures in whom he delights. Shalom, in other words, is the way things ought to be.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.faithandprosperity.com/shalom-the-real-utopia/ |title=Shalom: The Real Utopia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Use as name==
===Name for God===

The [[Talmud]] says, "the name of God is 'Peace'", therefore, one is not permitted to greet another with the word ''shalom'' in places such as a bathroom.&lt;ref&gt;[[Shabbat (Talmud)|Shabbat]] 10b from [[Book of Judges|Judges]] 6:24&lt;/ref&gt;

Biblical references make many Christians teach that "Shalom" is one of the sacred names of God.&lt;ref&gt;Stone, Nathan J. Names of God, pg. 6, Moody Publishers, 1987&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.blueletterbible.org/blb/2012/09/04/the-names-of-god-jehovah-shalom/|title=The Names of God: Jehovah Shalom|website=blogs.blueletterbible.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fanning, Don.

'''Third-Worldism''' is a political concept and ideology that emerged in the late 1940s or early 1950s during the [[Cold War]] and tried to generate unity among the nations that did not want to take sides between the [[United States]] and the [[Soviet Union]]. The concept is closely related but not identical to the political theory of [[Maoism-Third Worldism]].

The political thinkers and leaders of Third-Worldism argued that the North-South divisions and conflicts were of primary political importance compared to the [[Eastern Bloc|East]]-[[Western Bloc|West]] opposition of the Cold War period. In the [[Three-World Model]], the countries of the [[First World]] were the ones allied to the [[United States]]. These nations had, and still have, less [[political risk]], better functioning [[democracy]] and [[economic stability]], as well as higher [[standard of living]]. The [[Second World]] designation referred to the former [[Developed country|industrial]] [[socialist state]]s under the influence of the [[Soviet Union]]. The [[Third World]] hence defined countries that remained non-aligned with either [[NATO]], or the [[Communist Bloc]]. The [[Third World]] was normally seen to include many countries with [[Colonization|colonial]] pasts in [[Africa]], [[Latin America]], [[Oceania]] and [[Asia]]. It was also sometimes taken as synonymous with countries in the [[Non-Aligned Movement]], connected to the world economic division as [[Periphery countries|"periphery" countries]] in the world system that is dominated by the [[Core countries|"core" countries]].&lt;ref name="Tomlinson"&gt;Tomlinson, B.R. (2003). "What was the Third World", ''[[Journal of Contemporary History]]'', 38(2): 307–321.&lt;/ref&gt;

Third-Worldism was connected to new political movements following the [[Decolonization]] and new forms of regionalism that emerged in the erstwhile colonies of Asia, Africa, and the Middle-East, as well as in the older nation-states of Latin America : [[Pan-Arabism|pan-arabism]], [[Pan-Africanism|pan-africanism]], [[Pan-Americanism|pan-americanism]] and [[Pan-Asianism|pan-asianism]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The first period of the Third-World movement, that of the "first [[Bandung Conference|Bandung Era]]", was led by the Egyptian, Indonesian and Indian heads of states : [[Gamal Abdel Nasser|Nasser]], [[Sukarno]] and [[Jawaharlal Nehru|Nehru]]. They were followed in the 1960s and 1970s by a second generation of Third-Worldist governments that emphasized on a more radical and revolutionary socialist vision, personified by the figure of [[Che Guevara]]. Finally at the end of the Cold War in the late 1980s, Third Worldism began to enter into a period of decline.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Several leaders have been associated with the Third-Worldism movement.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="39244">The '''trial of [[Geert Wilders]]''', a member of the [[House of Representatives of the Netherlands]], took place in the [[Netherlands]] in 2010 and 2011. Wilders was accused of criminally insulting religious and ethnic groups and [[Incitement to ethnic or racial hatred|inciting hatred]] and [[Religious discrimination|discrimination]]. He was found not guilty in June 2011.&lt;ref name="acquitted1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2011/06/23/wilders-vrijgesproken-van-groepsbelediging/ |title=Wilders op alle punten vrijgesproken |last=Hinke |first=Bart |date=23 June 2011 |work=[[NRC Handelsblad]] |language=Dutch |accessdate=23 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The leader of the [[Party for Freedom]], Wilders has been the source of great controversy in the Netherlands and abroad for his [[criticism of Islam]] and what he describes as the [[Islamization]] of the Netherlands. At his trial, he faced five counts of criminal offenses. The first charge was of criminally insulting Muslims because of their religion. The remaining four charges pertained to incitement of hatred and discrimination of Muslims, [[Moroccan people|Moroccans]], and other non-[[Western world|Western]] immigrants because of their race or ethnicity. These charges stemmed from articles Wilders had written between 2006 and 2008, as well as his short film ''[[Fitna (film)|Fitna]]''. These statements included a call for a ban on the [[Quran]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Wilders: verbied de Koran, ook in moskee |url=http://www.volkskrant.nl/binnenland/article451302.ece/Wilders_verbied_de_Koran%2C_ook_in_moskee |language=Dutch |work=[[de Volkskrant]] |date=8 August 2007 |accessdate=8 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Genoeg is genoeg: verbied de Koran |url=http://www.volkskrant.nl/binnenland/article451338.ece/Genoeg_is_genoeg_verbied_de_Koran |work=[[de Volkskrant]] |date=8 August 2007 |first=Geert |last=Wilders |authorlink=Geert Wilders |accessdate=24 March 2008 |language=Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt; warnings against an "Islamic [[invasion]],"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pvv.nl/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=352&amp;Itemid=6 |title=Mohammed deel II: de islamitische invasie |work=[[Party for Freedom]] |accessdate=24 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a "tsunami of Islamization."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Wilders bang voor 'tsunami van islamisering' |url=http://www.volkskrant.nl/vk/nl/2686/Binnenland/article/detail/786026/2006/10/06/Wilders-bang-voor-tsunami-van-islamisering.dhtml |newspaper=[[de Volkskrant]] |date=6 October 2006 |accessdate=6 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also labeled Islam a [[Fascism|fascist]] religion, described Dutch-[[Morocco|Moroccan]] youths as violent, and compared the Quran with [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]'s ''[[Mein Kampf]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.radionetherlands.nl/currentaffairs/ned070808mc |title='Qur'an should be banned' – Wilders strikes again |publisher=[[Radio Netherlands]] |date=8 January 2007 |accessdate=24 March 2008 |first=Nicolien |last=den Boer |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080315004643/http://www.radionetherlands.nl/currentaffairs/ned070808mc |archivedate=15 March 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He has also referred to [[Mohammed]] as "the [[devil]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Cunningham |first=Benjamin |title=Islam opponent to visit Prague |url=http://www.praguepost.com/news/2905-islam-opponent-to-visit-prague.html |work=[[The Prague Post]] |accessdate=4 June 2011 |date=25 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=De profeet Mohammed is een enge duivel |url=http://www.nieuwsblad.be/Article/Detail.aspx?ArticleID=B11NPCFS |publisher=[[Het Nieuwsblad]] |accessdate=4 June 2011 |date=9 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The judges in the first trial were [[Judicial disqualification|removed]] due to perceived [[bias]] against Wilders,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-11609589 |title=Judges told to step down in Wilders trial |publisher=[[BBC]] |date=22 October 2010 |accessdate=31 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; so a [[New trial|retrial]] began in February 2011. The Dutch [[Openbaar Ministerie|Public Prosecution Service]], after initially refusing to prosecute Wilders because it did not consider his statements illegal, was ordered by a court of appeal to prosecute him nonetheless. During the process, they argued that Wilders should be acquitted on all counts.&lt;ref name=OM1&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.om.nl/actueel-0/strafzaken/strafzaak_tegen/@154305/public_prosecution_0/ |title=Public Prosecution Service requests acquittal for all counts in Wilders case |accessdate=27 May 2011 |date=15 October 2010 |publisher=[[Openbaar Ministerie]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 June 2011, Wilders was acquitted of all charges, with Judge Marcel van Oosten noting that his statements, although "gross and denigrating," had not given rise to hatred against Muslims, and as such were "acceptable within the context of public debate."&lt;ref name="acquitted2"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-13883331 |title=Geert Wilders cleared of hate charges by Dutch court |date=23 June 2011 |publisher=[[BBC News]] |accessdate=23 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Van Oosten also said, however, that Wilders's statements were on the edge of legal acceptability.&lt;ref name="acquitted3"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dutchnews.nl/news/archives/2011/06/wilders_found_not_guilty_of_in.php |title=Wilders found not guilty of inciting hatred, but is 'on the edge' |date=23 June 2011 |publisher=DutchNews.nl |accessdate=23 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
According to Article 71 of the [[Constitution of the Netherlands|Dutch Constitution]], as an MP, Wilders has immunity with regard to anything he says in or writes to [[States-General of the Netherlands|parliament]].&lt;ref&gt;Constitution of the Kingdom of The Netherlands Article 71 (English translation; "[[States-General of the Netherlands|States General]]" = Dutch parliament): ''"Article 71 Members of the States General, Ministers, State Secretaries and other persons taking part in deliberations may not be prosecuted or otherwise held liable in law for anything they say during the sittings of the States General or of its committees or for anything they submit to them in writing."''&lt;/ref&gt; However, this protection does not extend to opinions expressed outside of parliament, allowing for prosecution based on his criticism of Islam. The possibility that Wilders could be prosecuted became clear between 2007 and 2010, when protests against alleged insults and incitement to hatred resulted in his criminal prosecution by the [[district attorney]] in [[Amsterdam]]. On 3 February 2010, the Amsterdam court ruled itself to be competent on the charges against Wilders.

Some of his public comments, as well as some of the content of Wilders' film ''[[Fitna (film)|Fitna]]'', have been protested by agencies such as the Dutch anti-[[discrimination]] group ''Nederland Bekent Kleur'' ({{lang-nl|The Netherlands Shows True Colours}}).&lt;ref name=declines/&gt; On 15 August 2007, a representative of the public prosecution service in Amsterdam declared that dozens of reports filed against Wilders were being considered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.elsevier.nl/web/10133280/Nieuws/Politiek/Aangiftes-tegen-Wilders-stromen-binnen.htm |title=Aangiftes tegen Wilders stromen binnen |publisher=[[Elsevier (magazine)|Elsevier]] |language=Dutch |date=15 November 2007 |accessdate=15 March 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081005032528/http://www.elsevier.nl/web/10133280/Nieuws/Politiek/Aangiftes-tegen-Wilders-stromen-binnen.htm |archivedate=5 October 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Attempts to prosecute Wilders under Dutch anti-[[hate speech]] laws in June 2008 were dropped, with the public prosecution stating that Wilders' comments contributed to the debate on Islam in Dutch society and had been made outside parliament. The office released a statement reading: "That comments are hurtful and offensive for a large number of Muslims does not mean that they are punishable. Freedom of expression fulfils an essential role in public debate in a democratic society. That means that offensive comments can be made in a political debate."&lt;ref name=declines&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/06/30/europe/dutch.php |title=Holland declines to prosecute anti-Islam politician |date=30 June 2008 |accessdate=14 March 2009 |agency=[[Reuters]]  |work=[[International Herald Tribune]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=react/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/dutch-mp-to-be-tried-for-views-on-islam-1488654.html |title=Dutch MP to be tried for views on Islam |work=[[The Independent]] |date=22 January 2009 |accessdate=31 May 2011 |first=Vanessa |last=Mock}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prosecution==

===Decision to try===
The plaintiffs (''Nederlands Bekent Kleur'', organisations of [[Turks in the Netherlands|Turkish]], [[Moroccan-Dutch|Moroccan]] and [[Antilles|Antillean]] people in the Netherlands, and an organization of [[mosque]]s) appealed against the prosecution's decision to not pursue the case and on 21 January 2009, a three-judge [[Appellate court|court of appeal]] ordered the public prosecutor to try Wilders.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article5563071.ece |work=[[The Times]] |accessdate=31 May 2011 |title=Anti-Islam MP Geert Wilders faces trial over controversial film |date=22 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their statement said that "[i]n a democratic system, hate speech is considered so serious that it is in the general interest to... draw a clear line" and that "the court also considers appropriate criminal prosecution for insulting Muslim worshippers because of comparisons between Islam and Nazism made by Wilders".&lt;ref name=react/&gt; If convicted, he could have been sentenced for up to 16 months of jail time or a fine of €9866.67.&lt;ref name=forbes&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.forbes.com/2009/01/25/geert-wilders-speech-oped-cx_dvh_0126vanhoogstraten.html |title=Holland Puts Offensiveness On Trial |last=van Hoogstraten |first=Diederik |date=26 January 2009 |accessdate=15 March 2009 |work=[[Forbes]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; His lawyer [[Bram Moszkowicz]] tried to have the appeal overturned at the [[Hoge Raad der Nederlanden|Supreme Court of the Netherlands]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.radionetherlands.nl/currentaffairs/region/netherlands/090203-wilders-moszkowicz |title=Top lawyer to defend Dutch anti-Islam MP Wilders |last=Kievit |first=Rob |date=2 March 2009 |accessdate=15 March 2009 |publisher=[[Radio Netherlands Worldwide]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the Supreme Court's Procurator General decided he would not hear the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nieuwsbank.nl/inp/2009/05/20/R137.htm |title=Verzoek Moszkowicz tot het instellen van een vordering tot cassatie |accessdate=27 May 2011 |last=Fokkens |first=J.W. |date=20 May 2009 |publisher=Procurator General of the Dutch Supreme Court / Nieuwsbank |language=Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 December 2009, Wilders was ordered to appear before the court on 20 January 2010 to defend himself against the charges of group insult of Muslims, fomenting hate and discrimination against Muslims because of their religion, and fomenting hate and discrimination against non-Western foreigners or Moroccans because of their race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.elsevier.nl/web/Nieuws/Nederland/252551/Geert-Wilders-ontvangt-dagvaarding-voor-proces.htm |title=Geert Wilders ontvangt dagvaarding voor proces |work=[[Elsevier (magazine)|Elsevier]] |accessdate=31 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110611231310/http://www.elsevier.nl/web/Nieuws/Nederland/252551/Geert-Wilders-ontvangt-dagvaarding-voor-proces.htm |archivedate=11 June 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 11 January 2010, the Dutch public prosecution service brought additional charges against him, charging him with hatred against Moroccans and non-Western immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rnw.nl/english/article/hate-speak-charges-against-geert-wilders-widened |title=Geert Wilders hate speech charges widened |publisher=[[Radio Netherlands Worldwide]] |accessdate=31 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dutchnews.nl/news/archives/2010/01/more_charges_against_wilders.php |title=More charges against Wilders |publisher=DutchNews.nl |date=13 January 2010 |accessdate=31 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nrc.nl/international/article2462698.ece/Has_Wilders_broken_the_law |title=Has Wilders broken the law? |work=[[NRC Handelsblad]] |accessdate=31 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 January 2010, the Amsterdam court rejected, after a closed pretrial hearing, submissions by Wilders that one of the charges against him should be dropped or reduced. He argued that he had only criticized Islam and not its adherents, and that the charge of insulting Muslims as a group should not stand. His lawyer Moszkowicz petitioned judges to drop the charge of insulting Muslims as a group, which he said would have little chance of winning a conviction. He cited a 2009 Dutch Supreme Court ruling that found insulting a religion is not the same as insulting followers of that religion, and not punishable under the current [[hate speech]] laws. The judge said that the indictment only put into practice an earlier court ruling that he should stand trial and that the defense had not put forward any new evidence to overturn the ruling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rnw.nl/english/article/judge-rejects-geert-wilders-submission |title=Judge rejects Geert Wilders' submission |publisher=[[Radio Netherlands Worldwide]] |date=14 January 2010 |accessdate=31 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nrc.nl/international/article2459165.ece/Wilders_to_be_tried_for_hate_speech |title=Wilders to be tried for hate speech |publisher=[[NRC Handelsblad]] |date=14 January 2010 |accessdate=31 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Charges====
In total, Wilders was charged with the following five counts:
#Group [[insult]]
#[[Hate crime|Inciting hatred]] against Muslims because of their religion
#Inciting discrimination against Muslims because of their religion
#Inciting hatred against non-western [[allochtoon|immigrants]] and Moroccans because of their race
#Inciting discrimination against non-western immigrants and Moroccans because of their race

The first charge is based on article 137c of the Dutch criminal code, and the rest are based on article 137d, both concerning [[Hate speech#Netherlands|hate speech]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.om.nl/actueel-0/strafzaken/strafzaak_tegen/@154271/requisitoir-zaak/ |title=Requisitoir zaak-Wilders |publisher=[[Openbaar Ministerie]] |accessdate=31 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===First trial===
Court proceedings began on 20 January 2010, with Wilders accused of discrimination on the basis of religion and spreading hate. On the eve of his trial, Wilders told journalists he expected to be acquitted, saying, "I have done nothing wrong." After receiving the [[summons]], he commented that he considered the prosecution as "a political trial."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Murray |first=Douglas |url=http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/douglasmurray/100024056/geert-wilders-on-trial-for-telling-the-truth/ |title=Geert Wilders: on trial for telling the truth |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=28 January 2010 |accessdate=31 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also announced his intention to call various experts to act as [[witness]]es.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article6994396.ece |work=[[The Times]] |accessdate=31 May 2011 |title=Far-right MP Geert Wilders on trial for discrimination against Muslims |first=David |last=Charter |date=20 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.expatica.com/nl/news/dutch-rss-news/wilders-trial-begins-in-amsterdam_20551.html |title=Wilders trial begins in Amsterdam |publisher=[[Expatica]] |accessdate=31 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www1.voanews.com/english/news/europe/Dutch-Politician-on-Trial-for-Anti-Muslim-Comments-82187757.html |title=Dutch Politician on Trial for Anti-Muslim Comments |publisher=[[Voice of America]] |date=20 January 2010 |accessdate=31 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Waterfield |first=Bruno |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/netherlands/7037762/Geert-Wilders-in-Dutch-court-over-anti-Islam-comments.html |title=Geert Wilders in Dutch court over anti-Islam comments |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=20 January 2010 |accessdate=31 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/europe/01/20/netherlands.geert.wilders/ |title=Filmmaker Geert Wilders faces hatred charges |publisher=[[CNN]] |date=20 January 2010 |accessdate=31 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/europe/2010/01/201012094532873241.html |title=Dutch MP on trial for 'hate speech' |publisher=[[Al Jazeera English]] |accessdate=31 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the first day of the trial, Wilders gave a speech invoking [[Thomas Jefferson]], among others.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}

When the trial resumed on 3 February, the judges decided who would be allowed to testify as witnesses. Wilders's desired witness list consisted of various experts on both the law and Islam, including university professors, radical imams, and [[Mohammed Bouyeri]], the man who murdered filmmaker [[Theo van Gogh (film director)|Theo van Gogh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Goodenough |first=Patrick |url=http://www.cnsnews.com/news/article/60884 |title=Dutch Critic of Islam Wants Extremist Killer to Testify at His Trial |publisher=[[Cybercast News Service]] |date=3 February 2010 |accessdate=31 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606071933/http://www.cnsnews.com/news/article/60884 |archivedate=6 June 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other individuals on the list included [[Afshin Ellian]], a Dutch-Iranian professor at [[Leiden University]]; [[Hans Jansen]], a Dutch scholar of Islam; [[Wafa Sultan]], a [[Syrian American]] physician; [[Raphael Israeli]], a Moroccan-Israeli professor at the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]]; [[Andrew G. Bostom]], an American professor at [[Alpert Medical School]] of [[Brown University]]; [[Robert Spencer (author)|Robert Spencer]], an American author and blogger; and [[Ayatollah]]s [[Ahmad Jannati]] and [[Mohammad Yazdii]], members of the [[Iran]]ian [[Guardian Council]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.depers.nl/binnenland/401573/De-Getuigen.html |title=De getuigen |language=Dutch |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100125163948/http://www.depers.nl/binnenland/401573/De-Getuigen.html |archivedate=25 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The court rejected 15 of Wilders's 18 desired witnesses, ruling that Bouyeri and other Muslim extremists would not be allowed to testify in the case. The court accepted only the three Islam experts whom Wilders had called, rejecting the lawyers and Islamic extremists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nrc.nl/international/article2475574.ece/Van_Goghs_killer_rejected_as_Wilders_witness |title=Van Gogh's killer rejected as Wilders witness |work=[[NRC Handelsblad]] |date=4 February 2010 |accessdate=31 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rnw.nl/english/article/court-rejects-wilders%E2%80%99-extremist-witnesses |title=Court rejects Wilders’ extremist witnesses |publisher=[[Radio Netherlands Worldwide]] |date=3 February 2010 |accessdate=31 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dutchnews.nl/news/archives/2010/02/court_limits_wilders_witness_l.php |title=Court limits Wilders' witness list |publisher=DutchNews.nl |date=3 February 2010 |accessdate=31 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court also rejected the plea by Wilders's lawyer to transfer the case to the Supreme Court due to Wilders status as an MP. The court overruled this objection against its jurisdiction. "Parliamentary immunity does not extend to what a public representative says or writes outside of parliamentary gatherings." said Jan Moors, one of the judges at the Amsterdam court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dutchnews.nl/news/archives/2010/01/wilders_trial_to_resume_in_feb.php |title=Wilders' trial to resume in February |publisher=DutchNews.nl |date=21 January 2010 |accessdate=31 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rnw.nl/english/article/populist-mp-wilders-addresses-amsterdam-court |title=Populist MP Wilders addresses Amsterdam court |publisher=[[Radio Netherlands Worldwide]] |date=20 January 2010 |accessdate=31 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nrc.nl/binnenland/proceswilders/article2474842.ece/Proces_tegen_Wilders_aangehouden |title=Proces tegen Wilders aangehouden |work=[[NRC Handelsblad]] |date=2 September 2008 |accessdate=31 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/europe/2010/02/201023181713918592.html |title=Dutch hate speech trial to proceed |publisher=[[Al Jazeera English]] |date=3 February 2010 |accessdate=31 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/idUKTRE6123B120100203 |title=Amsterdam court to hear case against far-right MP Wilders |publisher=[[Reuters]] |accessdate=31 May 2011 |date=3 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rnw.nl/english/article/geert-wilders-doesnt-get-his-way-court |title=Geert Wilders doesn't get his way in court |publisher=[[Radio Netherlands Worldwide]] |accessdate=31 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dutchnews.nl/news/archives/2010/02/wilders_witness_list_published.php |title=Wilders' witness list published today |publisher=DutchNews.nl |date=3 February 2010 |accessdate=31 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilders consequently argued that he was being denied his [[right to a fair trial]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Goodenough |first=Patrick |url=http://www.cnsnews.com/news/article/60962 |title=Anti-Islam Dutch Lawmaker Says He’s Being Denied a Fair Trial; Court Rejects Most of His Witness List |publisher=[[Cybercast News Service]] |date=4 February 2010 |accessdate=31 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606072003/http://www.cnsnews.com/news/article/60962 |archivedate=6 June 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the trial it became clear that the prosecutors were arguing for Wilders to be acquitted on all five counts.&lt;ref name=OM1 /&gt;

On 22 October 2010, when the trial was nearing its conclusion, Wilders's attorney Moszkowicz asked for the judges to be [[substitution (law)|substituted]] because of a perceived bias against his client. Moszkowicz had unsuccessfully asked for substitution before. The second request was made because Tom Schalken, one of the judges in the court of appeal case that ordered the prosecution of Wilders on 21 January 2009 had allegedly tried to convince a witness in the main trial, Hans Jansen, that the trial was justified. Moszkowicz wanted to hear this witness immediately regarding the alleged conflict of interest, but the court decided it would not hear the witness. The substitution chamber decided that this decision had an appearance of bias and awarded the substitution, thereby ordering a [[New trial|retrial]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/oct/22/geert-wilders-trial-collapses Geert Wilders hate speech trial collapses in Netherlands], by Ian Traynor, Europe editor, guardian.co.uk, 22 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In the meantime, the alleged victims argued to the court of appeal that the prosecutors, by arguing for acquittal, had not fulfilled the court's order that Wilders had to be prosecuted, and that they should be replaced in the retrial. On 4 February 2011, the court of appeal decided against this complaint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.om.nl/actueel-0/strafzaken/strafzaak_tegen/@154942/afwijzing_klacht/ |title=Afwijzing klacht inzake Wilders |accessdate=28 May 2011 |date=4 February 2011 |publisher=[[Openbaar Ministerie]] |language=Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second trial===
On 7 February 2011, the retrial started. In the period between the trials, police investigated the claims that appellate judge Tom Schalken had tried to influence witness Hans Jansen. The new trial began with hearing the witnesses Schalken, Jansen, and Bertus Hendriks; the latter had hosted the dinner party at which Schalken spoke to Jansen. Moszkowicz argued that the trial against Geert Wilders could not continue because the witness had been influenced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.depers.nl/binnenland/545242/Schalken-en-Jansen-gehoord.html |title=Schalken en Jansen gehoord als getuigen |accessdate=28 May 2011 |date=14 February 2011 |work=[[De Pers]] |language=Dutch |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110217153947/http://www.depers.nl/binnenland/545242/Schalken-en-Jansen-gehoord.html |archivedate=17 February 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the hearing of Hendriks, Moszkowicz claimed that Hendriks had committed [[perjury]]; when the judges did not agree, Moszkowicz tried unsuccessfully to have them substituted as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dutchnews.nl/news/archives/2011/04/wilders_inciting_hatred_trial_6.php |title=Wilders inciting hatred trial: no new judges says legal panel |accessdate=28 May 2011 |date=18 April 2011 |publisher=DutchNews.nl |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110419181744/http://www.dutchnews.nl/news/archives/2011/04/wilders_inciting_hatred_trial_6.php |archivedate=19 April 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dutch writer and historian [[Ian Buruma]], writing in an [[op-ed]] published in the ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'', argued that "for a man who calls for a ban on the Koran to act as the champion of free speech is a bit rich."&lt;ref name=ian&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/30/opinion/30buruma.html |title=Totally Tolerant, Up to a Point |last=Buruma |first=Ian | authorlink = Ian Buruma |date=29 January 2009 |accessdate=15 March 2009 |work=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A February 2009 survey by [[Angus Reid Global Monitor]] found that Dutch [[public opinion]] was deeply split on the prosecution, with 50% supporting Wilders and 43% opposed.&lt;ref name=react&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.angus-reid.com/polls/view/32758/dutch_react_to_prosecution_of_wilders |title=Dutch React to Prosecution of Wilders |date=3 February 2009 |accessdate=15 March 2009 |publisher=[[Angus Reid Global Monitor]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090205220806/http://www.angus-reid.com/polls/view/32758/dutch_react_to_prosecution_of_wilders |archivedate=5 February 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, public support for the [[Party for Freedom]] vastly increased since Wilders's legal troubles began, virtually tying with the People's Party for Freedom and Democracy as the third most popular national party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dag.nl/binnenland/tumult-pvv-218531 |title=Uproar for PVV |date=25 January 2009 |accessdate=15 March 2009 |language=Dutch |publisher=[[DAG (newspaper)|DAG]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100102075502/http://www.dag.nl/binnenland/tumult-pvv-218531 |archivedate=2 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Radio Netherlands Worldwide|Radio Netherlands]], "Dutch politicians themselves seem to be keeping quiet on the issue; they are probably worried that media attention will only serve to make the controversial politician more popular."&lt;ref name=nicola&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.radionetherlands.nl/currentaffairs/region/netherlands/090122-wilders-reactions |title=Worldwide reactions to Wilders' prosecution |last=Chadwick |first=Nicola |date=22 January 2009 |accessdate=15 March 2009 |publisher=[[Radio Netherlands Worldwide]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090331222921/http://www.radionetherlands.nl/currentaffairs/region/netherlands/090122-wilders-reactions |archivedate=31 March 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert Spencer (writer)|Robert Spencer]], creator of [[Jihad Watch]] and author of articles and books relating to Islam and [[Islamic terrorism]], wrote on [[National Review|National Review Online]] that "The Geert Wilders trial ought to be an international media event; seldom has any court case anywhere had such enormous implications for the future of the free world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=NRO Symposium |url=http://article.nationalreview.com/424251/western-civilization-on-trial/nro-symposium |title=Western Civilization on Trial – Why we should be watching Geert Wilders |publisher=[[National Review]] |date=8 February 2010 |accessdate=31 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100211125355/http://article.nationalreview.com/424251/western-civilization-on-trial/nro-symposium |archivedate=11 February 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Free speech===
Wilders believed that his freedom of speech and traditional European freedoms were the primary subject of the trial. In February 2010, in an interview with [[Israel National Radio]], Wilders said he was "fighting for one thing: the preservation of our culture, which is based on Christianity, Judaism and humanism – and not on Islam... While Islamization of our society grows, the political elite looks in the other direction and ignores the real problem, namely, the impending loss of our freedom. I am fighting not against Moslems, but against the influx of a totalitarian ideology called Islam."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/135935 |title="Geert Wilders to INN: "Traditional European Freedom at Stake" |publisher=[[Arutz Sheva]] |accessdate=31 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/Radio/News.aspx/1923 |title=Audio: Geert Wilders and Feiglin |publisher=[[Arutz Sheva]] |date=8 February 2010 |accessdate=31 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has cited [[Gregorius Nekschot]], a similar case of Islam related free-speech restrictions, on his website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pvv.nl/index.php/component/content/article/36-geert-wilders/4316-creeping-sharia.html |title=Creeping sharia |publisher=[[Party for Freedom]] |accessdate=31 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After being cleared of all charges, Wilders commented that the victory was not only an acquittal for himself, but a victory for [[Human rights in the Netherlands|freedom of expression in the Netherlands]].&lt;ref name=acquitted2 /&gt; Commentators believed that the plaintiffs may attempt to bring their case before the [[European Court of Human Rights]].&lt;ref name=acquitted2 /&gt; Gerard Spong, a lawyer instrumental in getting the case heard, expressed his disappointment with the verdict, seeing the judge's ruling based on "public context" as vague. Theo de Roos, professor of law at the [[Tilburg University]], saw the case as a precedent for [[Incitement to ethnic or racial hatred|ethnic incitement]] in Dutch law, prohibiting only actual threats.&lt;ref name=acquitted3 /&gt;

[[File:Tsunami evac sign Seaside Oregon.JPG|thumb|300px|Evacuation route sign in a low-lying coastal area on the West Coast of the United States]]
A '''tsunami warning system''' ('''TWS''') is used to detect [[tsunami]]s in advance and issue warnings to prevent loss of life and damage to property. It is made up of two equally important components: a network of sensors to detect tsunamis and a communications infrastructure to issue timely alarms to permit evacuation of the coastal areas.  There are two distinct types of tsunami warning systems: '''international''' and '''regional'''.  When operating, seismic alerts are used to instigate the watches and warnings; then, data from observed sea level height (either shore-based tide gauges or [[Deep-ocean Assessment and Reporting of Tsunamis|DART]] buoys) are used to verify the existence of a tsunami.  Other systems have been proposed to augment the warning procedures; for example, it has been suggested that the duration and frequency content of [[T wave (seismic)|t-wave]] energy (which is earthquake energy trapped in the ocean [[SOFAR channel]]) is indicative of an earthquake's tsunami potential.&lt;ref&gt;Salzberg, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and forecasting==
{{unreferenced|section|date=June 2017}}
The first rudimentary system to alert communities of an impending tsunami was attempted in [[Hawaii]] in the 1920s. More advanced systems were developed in the wake of the April 1, 1946 (caused by the [[1946 Aleutian Islands earthquake]]) and May 23, 1960 (caused by the [[1960 Valdivia earthquake]]) tsunamis which caused massive devastation in [[Hilo, Hawaii]].  While tsunamis travel at between 500 and 1,000&amp;nbsp;km/h (around 0.14 and 0.28&amp;nbsp;km/s) in open water, earthquakes can be detected almost at once as [[seismic wave]]s travel with a typical speed of 4&amp;nbsp;km/s (around 14,400&amp;nbsp;km/h).  This gives time for a possible tsunami forecast to be made and warnings to be issued to threatened areas, if warranted.  Until a reliable model is able to predict which earthquakes will produce significant tsunamis, this approach will produce many more false alarms than verified warnings.

==International  systems (IS)==

===Pacific Ocean===
[[File:TsunamiHazardSign.svg|right|thumb|Japanese Tsunami warning sign]]
Tsunami warnings for most of the [[Pacific Ocean]] are issued by the [[Pacific Tsunami Warning Center]] (PTWC), operated by the [[United States]] [[NOAA]] in [[Ewa Beach, Hawaii]]. NOAA's [[National Tsunami Warning Center]] (NTWC) in [[Palmer, Alaska]] issues warnings for the west coast of North America, including Alaska, British Columbia, Oregon and California. The PTWC was established in 1949, following the 1946 [[Aleutian Island earthquake]] and a tsunami that resulted in 165 casualties on Hawaii and in Alaska; NTWC was founded in 1967. International coordination is achieved through the International Coordination Group for the Tsunami Warning System in the Pacific, established by the [[Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission]] of [[UNESCO]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ioc.unesco.org/itsu/ |title=IOC Oceans &amp;#124; United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization |publisher=Ioc.unesco.org |date= |accessdate=2018-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, The US congressional panel passed a vote to continue funding a global tsunami detection system that gives U.S. officials an accurate forecast in order to decrease damage cause by Tsunamis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.virginislandsdailynews.com/ap/threatened-by-trump-s-budget-tsunami-warning-system-gets-backing/article_7ab750c2-46dd-57b5-8d51-711f2435e6b5.html|title=Threatened by Trump's budget, tsunami warning system gets backing from congressional panel|last=Times|first=Los Angeles|work=The Virgin Islands Daily News|access-date=2017-07-18|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indian Ocean (ICG/IOTWS)===
{{main article|Indian Ocean Tsunami Warning System}}

[[File:Tsunami-warning-centre hikkaduwa sri-lanka.jpg|right|thumb|Tsunami Early Warning Tower board in Hikkaduwa, Sri Lanka]]

After the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake|2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami]] which killed almost 250,000 people, a [[United Nations]] conference was held in January 2005 in [[Kobe]], [[Japan]], and decided that as an initial step towards an [[International Early Warning Programme]], the UN should establish an [[Indian Ocean Tsunami Warning System]]. This then resulted in a system of warnings in Indonesia and other affected areas.

===North Eastern Atlantic, the Mediterranean and Connected Seas (ICG/NEAMTWS)===
The First United Session of the Inter-governmental Coordination Group for the Tsunami Early Warning and Mitigation System in the North Eastern Atlantic, the Mediterranean and connected Seas (ICG/NEAMTWS), established by the [[Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission]] of [[UNESCO]] Assembly during its 23rd Session in June 2005, through Resolution XXIII.14, took place in [[Rome]] on 21 and 22 November 2005.

The meeting, hosted by the Government of Italy (the [[Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] and the [[Ministry of the Environment (Italy)|Italian Ministry for the Environment and Protection of Land and Sea]]), was attended by more than 150 participants from 24 countries, 13 organizations and numerous observers.

===Caribbean===

A Caribbean-wide tsunami warning system was planned to be instituted by the year 2010, by representatives of [[Caribbean Community|Caribbean nations]] who met in [[Panama City]] in March 2008. [[Panama]]'s last major tsunami killed 4,500 people in 1882.&lt;ref&gt;[http://uk.reuters.com/article/environmentNews/idUKN1332624020080313 Reuters:Caribbean plans tsunami warning system by 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Barbados]] has said it will review or test its tsunami protocol in February 2010 as a regional pilot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Harewood said Barbados was nominated and accepted as the "pilot state" for the tsunami protocol which will be discussed from February 22 to 26.  He said the objective of the Standard Operational Procedure and Communications Protocol, which has been being worked on for the last two years, is to provide more information on what must be done in the event of a tsunami, earthquake or any other major disaster.  He noted that one of the things they would be doing was adopting a general public service announcement through the Government Information Service (GIS) to help increase awareness of tsunamis.
}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{update after|2014|7}}

==Regional warning systems==
Regional (or local) warning system centres use [[seismic]] data about nearby recent earthquakes to determine if there is a possible local threat of a tsunami. Such systems are capable of issuing warnings to the general public (via public address systems and sirens) in less than 15 minutes. Although the [[epicenter]] and [[moment magnitude scale|moment magnitude]] of an underwater quake and the probable tsunami arrival times can be quickly calculated, it is almost always impossible to know whether underwater ground shifts have occurred which will result in tsunami waves. As a result, false alarms can occur with these systems, but the disruption is small, which makes sense due to the highly localised nature of these extremely quick warnings, in combination with how difficult it would be for a false alarm to affect more than a small area of the system. Real tsunamis would affect more than just a small portion.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

===Japan===
Japan has a nationwide tsunami warning system. The system usually issues the warning minutes after an [[Earthquake Early Warning (Japan)|Earthquake Early Warning]] (EEW) is issued, should there be expected waves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Japan Meteorological Agency｜Flow of issuance of information about tsunami and earthquake|url=http://www.data.jma.go.jp/svd/eqev/data/en/guide/info.html|accessdate=15 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="2011warning"&gt;{{cite web|title=80 Seconds of Warning for Tokyo|url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/423274/80-seconds-of-warning-for-tokyo/|website=MIT Technology Review|accessdate=15 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tsunami warning was issued within 3 minutes with the most serious rating on its warning scale during the [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami]]; it was rated as a "major tsunami", being at least 3&amp;nbsp;m (9.8&amp;nbsp;ft) high.&lt;ref name="2011warning"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Emergency Warning System Starting Shortly|url=http://www.jma.go.jp/jma/en/Emergency_Warning/Leaflet(Emergency_Warning).pdf|accessdate=15 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; An improved system was unveiled on March 7, 2013 following the 2011 disaster to better access the waves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Leaflet "Start of New Tsunami Warning System Operation"|url=http://www.data.jma.go.jp/svd/eqev/data/en/tsunami/tsunamiwarning-leaflet.pdf|accessdate=15 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tsunami two years on: Japan finally gets warning system that would have saved hundreds of lives|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/japan/9920042/Tsunami-two-years-on-Japan-finally-gets-warning-system-that-would-have-saved-hundreds-of-lives.html|accessdate=15 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conveying the warning==
{{unreferenced|section|date=June 2017}}
[[File:Okumatsushima tsunami P1130317 rotated.jpg|thumb|Mast with warning system, and sign detailing escape routes, on the coast of [[Okumatsushima]], [[Miyagi Prefecture|Miyagi]] prefecture, [[Japan]] (this coast was severely hit by the [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami|2011 tsunami]])]]
Detection and prediction of tsunamis is only half the work of the system. Of equal importance is the ability to warn the populations of the areas that will be affected. All tsunami warning systems feature multiple lines of communications (such as [[SMS]], [[e-mail]], [[fax]], [[radio]], texting and [[teleprinter|telex]], often using hardened dedicated systems) enabling emergency messages to be sent to the [[emergency service]]s and [[armed forces]], as well to population-alerting systems (e.g. [[siren (noisemaker)|sirens]]) and systems like the [[Emergency Alert System]].

==Shortcomings==
{{unreferenced|section|date=June 2017}}
With the speed at which tsunami waves travel through open water, no system can protect against a very sudden tsunami, where the coast in question is too close to the [[epicenter]]. A devastating tsunami occurred off the coast of [[Hokkaidō]] in Japan as a result of [[1993 Hokkaidō earthquake|an earthquake on July 12, 1993]]. As a result, 202 people on the small island of [[Okushiri, Hokkaido]] lost their lives, and hundreds more were missing or injured. This tsunami struck just three to five minutes after the quake, and most victims were caught while fleeing for higher ground and secure places after surviving the earthquake. This was also the case in [[Aceh]], Indonesia.

While there remains the potential for sudden devastation from a tsunami, warning systems can be effective. For example, if there were a very large [[subduction zone]] [[earthquake]] ([[moment magnitude scale|moment magnitude]] 9.0) off the west coast of the [[United States]], people in [[Japan]], would therefore have more than 12 hours (and likely warnings from warning systems in Hawaii and elsewhere) before any tsunami arrived, giving them some time to evacuate areas likely to be affected.

{{farming}}

'''Urban agriculture,''' '''urban farming''', or '''urban gardening''' is the practice of cultivating, processing and distributing [[food]] in or around [[urban areas]].&lt;ref&gt;Bailkey, M., and J. Nasr. 2000. "From Brownfields to Greenfields: Producing Food in North American Cities," ''Community Food Security News''. Fall 1999/Winter 2000:6&lt;/ref&gt; Urban agriculture can also involve [[animal husbandry]], [[aquaculture]], [[agroforestry]], [[urban beekeeping]], and [[horticulture]]. These activities occur in [[peri-urban]] areas as well, and [[peri-urban agriculture]] may have different characteristics.&lt;ref name="otherurbanag"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fanrpan.org/archive/documents/d00780/|title=The role of urban agriculture in addressing household poverty and food security: the case of Zambia|author1=Hampwaye, G.|author2=Nel, E.|date=|website=|publisher=Gdnet.org|accessdate=1 April 2013|author3=Ingombe, L.|lastauthoramp=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;
  
Urban agriculture can reflect varying levels of economic and social development. It may be a social movement for sustainable communities, where organic growers, "foodies," and "[[locavore]]s" form social networks founded on a shared ethos of nature and community holism. These networks can evolve when receiving formal institutional support, becoming integrated into local town planning as a "transition town" movement for sustainable urban development. For others, [[food security]], nutrition, and income generation are key motivations for the practice. In either case, more direct access to fresh vegetables, fruits, and meat products through urban agriculture can improve food security and [[food safety]].

==History==
In semi-desert towns of Persia, oases were fed through aqueducts that carried mountain water to support intensive food production, nurtured by wastes from the communities.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Continuous productive urban landscapes : designing urban agriculture for sustainable cities|last=André.|first=Viljoen|date=2005|publisher=Architectural Press|others=Bohn, Katrin., Howe, J. (Joe)|isbn=9780750655439|location=Oxford|oclc=60533269}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Machu Picchu]], water was conserved and reused as part of the stepped architecture of the city, and vegetable beds were designed to gather sun in order to prolong the growing season.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; 

[[File:City experiment in gardening, New York City LCCN93501876.jpg|thumb|left|A gardening demonstration in New York City, 1922]] The idea of supplemental food production beyond rural farming operations and distant imports is not new. It has been used during war and depression times when food shortage issues arose, as well as during times of relative abundance. [[Allotment garden]]s came up in Germany in the early 19th century as a response to poverty and food insecurity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www2.gtz.de/Dokumente/oe44/ecosan/nl/en-allotment-gardens-cagayan-de-oro-2005.pdf |title=untitles |access-date=13 March 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719034258/http://www2.gtz.de/Dokumente/oe44/ecosan/nl/en-allotment-gardens-cagayan-de-oro-2005.pdf |archive-date=19 July 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In 1893, citizens of a depression-struck [[Detroit]] were asked to use any vacant lots to grow vegetables. They were nicknamed Pingree's Potato Patches after the mayor, [[Hazen S. Pingree]], who came up with the idea. He intended for these gardens to produce income, food supply, and even boost independence during times of hardship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hazen S. Pingree Monument|url=http://historicdetroit.org/building/hazen-s-pingree-monument/|website=http://historicdetroit.org/|publisher=DAN AUSTIN}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Victory garden]]s sprouted during WWI and WWII and were fruit, vegetable, and herb gardens in US, Canada, and UK. This effort was undertaken by citizens to reduce pressure on food production that was to support the war effort. 

During the first World War, President Woodrow Wilson called upon all American citizens to utilize any available open space for food growth, seeing this as a way to pull them out of a potentially damaging situation. Because most of Europe was consumed with war, they were unable to produce sufficient food supplies to be shipped to the U.S., and a new plan was implemented with the intent to feed the U.S. and even supply a surplus to other countries in need. By the year 1919, over 5 million plots were growing food and over 500 million pounds of produce was harvested. 

[[File:MONTREUIL - Le clos des peches.jpg|thumb|Peaches in [[Montreuil, Seine-Saint-Denis]], [[France]]]]
A very similar practice came into use during the Great Depression that provided a purpose, a job, and food to those who would otherwise be without anything during such harsh times. In this case, these efforts helped to raise spirits socially as well as to boost economic growth. Over 2.8 million dollars worth of food was produced from the subsistence gardens during the Depression. By the time of the Second World War, the War/Food Administration set up a National Victory Garden Program that set out to systematically establish functioning agriculture within cities. With this new plan in action, as many as 5.5 million Americans took part in the victory garden movement and over 9 million pounds of fruit and vegetables were grown a year, accounting for 44% of U.S.-grown produce throughout that time.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

[[Community garden]]ing in most communities are open to the public and provide space for citizens to cultivate plants for food or recreation. A community gardening program that is well-established is Seattle's [[P-Patch]]. The grassroots [[permaculture]] movement has been hugely influential in the renaissance of urban agriculture throughout the world.  The Severn Project in Bristol was started in 2010 for £2500 and provides 34 tons of produce per year, employing people from disadvantaged backgrounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Severn Project|url=http://www.thesevernproject.org/our-story/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{anchor|City farm}}''City farms'' are agricultural plots in [[urban area]]s, which involve people working with [[Animal agriculture|animals]] and plants to produce food. City farms are usually [[Community gardening|community-run gardens]] which aim to improve community relationships and offer an awareness of [[agriculture]] and [[farming]] to people who live in urbanized areas. City farms are important sources of [[food security]] for many communities around the globe. City farms vary in size from small plots in private yards to larger farms that occupy a number of acres. In 1996, a United Nations report estimated there are over 800 million people worldwide who grow food and raise livestock in cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last=Lawson| first=Laura| date=2016-12-22| title=Agriculture: Sowing the city| url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v540/n7634/full/540522a.html| journal=Nature| language=en| volume=540| issue=7634| pages=522–524| doi=10.1038/540522a| issn=0028-0836| bibcode=2016Natur.540..522L}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although some city farms have paid employees, most rely heavily on volunteer labour, and some are run by volunteers alone. Other city farms operate as partnerships with [[local authority|local authorities]].

During the 1960s a number of [[community gardens]] were established in the [[United Kingdom]], influenced by the community garden movement in the [[United States]]. The first city farm was set up in 1972 in [[Kentish Town]], [[London]]. It combined farm animals with gardening space, an addition inspired by children's farms in the [[Netherlands]]. Other city farms followed across London and the United Kingdom. In Australia, several city farms exist in various capital cities. In [[Melbourne]], the [[Collingwood Children's Farm]] was established in 1979 on the Abbotsford Precinct Heritage Farmlands (the APHF), the oldest continually farmed land in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], farmed since 1838.

In 2010, New York City saw the building and opening of the world's largest privately owned and operated [[rooftop farm]], followed by an even larger location in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/new-york-could-grown-all-its-own-food-180949748/|title=History, Travel, Arts, Science, People, Places - Smithsonian|work=smithsonianmag.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both were a result of municipal programs such as The Green Roof Tax Abatement Program&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nyc.gov/html/dob/html/sustainability/green_roofs.shtml|title=Department of Buildings|work=nyc.gov|access-date=9 February 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160213083527/http://www.nyc.gov/html/dob/html/sustainability/green_roofs.shtml|archive-date=13 February 2016|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Green Infrastructure Grant Program.&lt;ref&gt;https://a826-web01.nyc.gov/GIGrant/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Perspectives==

===Resource and economic===
The Urban Agriculture Network has defined urban agriculture as:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Urban agriculture : food, jobs and sustainable cities|date=1996|publisher=United Nations Development Programme|others=Cheema, G. Shabbir., Smit, Jac., Ratta, Annu., Nasr, Joe., United Nations Development Programme., Urban Agriculture Network.|isbn=9789211260472|location=New York, N.Y.|oclc=34575217}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
[A]n industry that produces, processes, and markets food, fuel, and other outputs, largely 
in response to the daily demand of consumers within a town, city, or [[metropolis]], on many 
types of privately and publicly held land and water bodies found throughout intra-urban and 
peri-urban areas. Typically urban agriculture applies [[intensive agriculture|intensive production]] methods, 
frequently using and reusing natural resources and urban wastes, to yield a diverse array of 
land-, water-, and air-based fauna and flora contributing to the food security, health, 
livelihood, and environment of the individual, household, and community.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Globalization has removed the need and ability of a community's agency in their food production. This results in an inability to address food injustice on a smaller, more manageable scale. This is especially true in cities. Today, most cities have lots of vacant land due to urban sprawl and home foreclosures. This land could be used to address food insecurity. One study of Cleveland shows that city could actually meet up to 100% of its fresh produce need. This would prevent up to $115 million in annual economic leakage. Using the rooftop space of New York City would also be able to provide roughly twice the amount of space necessary to supply New York City with its green vegetable yields. Space could be even better optimized through the usage of hydroponic or indoor factory production of food. Growing gardens within cities would also cut down on the amount of food waste. In order to fund these projects, it would require financial capital in the form of private enterprises or government funding. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Grewal|first=Sharanbir S.|last2=Grewal|first2=Parwinder S.|title=Can cities become self-reliant in food?|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0264275111000692|journal=Cities|volume=29|issue=1|pages=1–11|doi=10.1016/j.cities.2011.06.003|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
===Environmental===
The [[Council for Agricultural Science and Technology]] (CAST) defines urban agriculture to include aspects of environmental health, remediation, and recreation:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cast-science.org |author=Butler, L. and D.M. Moronek (eds.)|date=May 2002 |title=Urban and Agriculture Communities: Opportunities for Common Ground |publisher=Council for Agricultural Science and Technology |location=Ames, Iowa |accessdate=1 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Urban agriculture is a complex system encompassing a spectrum of interests, from a traditional core of activities associated with the production, processing, marketing, distribution, and consumption, to a multiplicity of other benefits and services that are less widely acknowledged and documented. These include recreation and leisure; economic vitality and business entrepreneurship, individual health and well-being; community health and well being; landscape beautification; and environmental restoration and remediation.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Modern planning and design initiatives&lt;ref name="Boeing2016"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://geoffboeing.com/publications/how-neighborhoods-lost-food/|author=Boeing, G.|title=How Our Neighborhoods Lost Food, and How They Can Get It Back|journal=Progressive Planning|date=2016|volume=206|issue=Winter|pages=35–37|accessdate=2016-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; are often more responsive to this model of urban agriculture because it fits within the current scope of [[sustainable design]]. The definition allows for a multitude of interpretations across cultures and time. Frequently it is tied to policy decisions to build sustainable cities.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fraser | first1 = Evan D.G. | year = 2002 | title = Urban Ecology in Bangkok Thailand: Community Participation, Urban Agriculture and Forestry | url = | journal = Environments | volume = 30 | issue = | page = 1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Urban farms also provide unique opportunities for individuals, especially those living in cities, to get actively involved with ecological citizenship. By reconnecting with food production and nature, urban community gardening teaches individuals the skills necessary to participate in a democratic society. Decisions must be made on a group-level basis in order to run the farm. Most effective results are achieved when residents of a community are asked to take on more active roles in the farm. &lt;ref&gt;Katharine Travaline &amp; Christian Hunold (2010) Urban agriculture and ecological citizenship in Philadelphia, Local Environment, 15:6, 581-590, DOI: 10.1080/13549839.2010.487529&lt;/ref&gt;

===Food security===
{{main article |Food security}}
Access to nutritious food, both economically and geographically, is another perspective in the effort to locate food and livestock production in cities. With the tremendous influx of world population to urban areas, the need for fresh and safe food is increased. The [[Community Food Security Coalition]] (CFSC) defines food security as:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
All persons in a community having access to culturally acceptable, nutritionally adequate food through local, non-emergency sources at all times.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Areas faced with food security issues have limited choices, often relying on highly [[food processing|processed]] [[fast food]] or convenience store foods that are high in calories and low in nutrients, which may lead to elevated rates of diet-related illnesses such as diabetes. These problems have brought about the concept of [[food justice]] which Alkon and Norgaard (2009; 289) explain is, "places access to healthy, affordable, culturally appropriate food in the contexts of institutional racism, racial formation, and racialized geographies.... Food justice serves as a theoretical and political bridge between scholarship and activism on sustainable agriculture, food insecurity, and [[environmental justice]]." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1111/j.1475-682x.2009.00291.x |title=Breaking the Food Chains: An Investigation of Food Justice Activism |journal=Sociological Inquiry |volume=79 |issue=3 |pages=289–305 |year=2009 |last1=Alkon |first1=Alison Hope |last2=Norgaard |first2=Kari Marie}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some systematic reviews have already explored urban agriculture contribution to food security and other determinants of health outcomes (see &lt;ref name="Audate PP, Fernandez MA, Cloutier G, Lebel A 2018"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2196/resprot.9427 |pmid=29588270 |pmc=5893886 |title=Impacts of Urban Agriculture on the Determinants of Health: Scoping Review Protocol |journal=JMIR |volume=7 |issue=3 |pages=e89 |year=2018 |last1=Audate |first1=PP |last2=Fernandez |first2=MA |last3=Cloutier |first3=G |last4=Lebel |first4=A }} http://www.researchprotocols.org/2018/3/e89&lt;/ref&gt;)

==Impact==

===Economic===
Urban and peri-urban agriculture (UPA) expands the economic base of the city through production, processing, packaging, and [[agricultural marketing|marketing]] of consumable products. This results in an increase in entrepreneurial activities and the [[job creation|creation of jobs]], as well as reducing food costs and improving quality.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Urban agriculture for sustainable cities: using wastes and idle land and water bodies as resources. Jac Smit, Joe Nasr. ''Environment and Urbanization,'' Vol 4, Issue 2, pp. 141 - 152. First Published October 1, 1992. &lt;nowiki&gt;https://doi.org/10.1177/095624789200400214&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; UPA provides employment, income, and access to food for urban populations, which helps to relieve chronic and emergency food insecurity. Chronic food insecurity refers to less affordable food and growing [[urban poverty]], while emergency food insecurity relates to breakdowns in the chain of [[food distribution]]. UPA plays an important role in making food more affordable and in providing emergency supplies of food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/fcit/upa/en/ |author=Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations |title=Urban and Peri-urban Agriculture, Household Food Security and Nutrition |publisher=FAO |accessdate=1 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research into market values for produce grown in urban gardens has attributed to a [[community garden]] plot a median yield value of between approximately $200 and $500 (US, adjusted for inflation).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sarep.ucdavis.edu/newsltr/v7n3/sa-10.htm Sommers, L., and B. Butterfield, as cited in: Blair, D., C. Giesecke, and S. Sherman. (1991). "A Dietary, Social and Economic Evaluation of the Philadelphia Urban Gardening Project," ''Journal of Nutrition Education''.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070716000637/http://www.sarep.ucdavis.edu/newsltr/v7n3/sa-10.htm |date=16 July 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social===
[[File:Kstovo-hay-1536.jpg|thumb|The needs of urban landscaping can be combined with those of suburban livestock farmers. ([[Kstovo]], Russia).]]

Urban agriculture can have a large impact on the social and emotional well-being of individuals. &lt;ref name="Wakefield, S. 2007"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/heapro/dam001 |pmid=17324956 |title=Growing urban health: Community gardening in South-East Toronto |journal=Health Promotion International |volume=22 |issue=2 |pages=92–101 |year=2007 |last1=Wakefield |first1=S. |last2=Yeudall |first2=F. |last3=Taron |first3=C. |last4=Reynolds |first4=J. |last5=Skinner |first5=A. }}&lt;/ref&gt; UA can have an overall positive impact on [[community health]], which directly impacts individuals social and emotional well-being.   &lt;ref name="Wakefield, S. 2007"/&gt; Urban gardens are often places that facilitate positive [[social interaction]], which also contributes to overall social and emotional well-being. Many gardens facilitate the improvement of social networks within the communities that they are located. For many neighborhoods, gardens provide a “symbolic focus,” which leads to increased neighborhood pride.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S1353-8292(00)00013-7 |pmid=11027957 |title=A survey of community gardens in upstate New York: Implications for health promotion and community development |journal=Health &amp; Place |volume=6 |issue=4 |pages=319–27 |year=2000 |last1=Armstrong |first1=Donna }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Related to the previous point, urban agriculture increases community participation through sensibilization and diagnostic workshops or different commissions in the area of vegetable gardens. Activities which involve hundreds of people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sior.ub.edu/jspui/cris/socialimpact/socialimpact00444|title=Increased community participation. [Social Impact]. Cities Without Hunger - Community Gardens: Sao Paulo (2003-2009).|last=|first=|date=|website=SIOR, Social Impact Open Repository|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When individuals come together around UA, physical activity levels are often increased.  Many state that working in agriculture is much more interesting and fulfilling than going to the gym, and that it makes getting [[physical exercise|exercise]] “fun.”  In addition to the exercise that individuals receive while actually working in gardens, many people say that the majority of the exercise they receive through urban agriculture is actually getting to the gardens—many people either walk or ride their bike to the sites, which provides many physical benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/02614360902769894 |title=Cultivating health and wellbeing: Members' perceptions of the health benefits of a Port Melbourne community garden |journal=Leisure Studies |volume=28 |issue=2 |pages=207–19 |year=2009 |last1=Kingsley |first1=Jonathan 'Yotti' |last2=Townsend |first2=Mardie |last3=Henderson‐Wilson |first3=Claire }}&lt;/ref&gt;

UPA can be seen as a means of improving the [[livelihood]] of people living in and around cities. Taking part in such practices is seen mostly as informal activity, but in many cities where inadequate, unreliable, and irregular access to food is a recurring problem, urban agriculture has been a positive response to tackling food concerns. Due to the food security that comes with UA, feelings of independence and empowerment often arise. The ability to produce and grow food for oneself has also been reported to improve levels of self-esteem or of self-efficacy.&lt;ref name="Wakefield, S. 2007"/&gt; Households and small communities take advantage of vacant land and contribute not only to their household food needs but also the needs of their resident city.&lt;ref name=Hales&gt;[http://www.mygreenhobby.com/urban-agriculture-why-it-has-a-positive-impact/ Hales et al. (2016). "Urban Agriculture: Urban agriculture, positive impact"] ''My Green Hobby''&lt;/ref&gt; The CFSC states that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Community and residential gardening, as well as small-scale farming, save household food dollars. They promote nutrition and free cash for non-garden foods and other items. As an example, you can raise your own chickens on an urban farm and have fresh eggs for only $0.44 per dozen.&lt;ref&gt;What's the Real Cost of Raising Backyard Chickens? (2015, March 29). Retrieved April 2, 2015, from http://www.urbanfarminghq.com/cost-of-raising-backyard-chickens/ {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402184950/http://www.urbanfarminghq.com/cost-of-raising-backyard-chickens/ |date=2 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This allows families to generate larger incomes selling to local [[grocer]]s or to local outdoor markets while supplying their household with the proper nutrition of fresh and nutritional products.

[[File:Ezhou-train-station-0109.jpg|thumb|rt|250px|A vegetable garden in the square in front of the train station in [[Ezhou]], China]]

Some community urban farms can be quite efficient and help women find work, who in some cases are marginalized from finding employment in the formal economy.&lt;ref&gt;FAO. (1999). "Issues in Urban Agriculture," ''FAO Spotlight Magazine,'' January.&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have shown that participation from women have a higher production rate, therefore producing the adequate amount for household consumption while supplying more for market sale.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.idrc.ca/fr/ev-2490-201-1-DO_TOPIC.html#gender%20and%20land Mahbuba Kaneez Hasna.

As most UA activities are conducted on vacant municipal land, there have been raising concerns about the allocation of land and property rights. The [[International Development Research Centre|IDRC]] and the [[Food and Agriculture Organization|FAO]] have published the Guidelines for Municipal Policymaking on Urban Agriculture, and are working with municipal governments to create successful policy measures that can be incorporated in urban planning.&lt;ref&gt;IDRC/ UN-HABITAT".Guidelines for Municipal Policymaking on Urban Agriculture" Urban Agriculture: Land Management and Physical Planning (2003) [http://www.ruaf.org/sites/default/files/Guideline%203%20Urban%20agriculture%20-%20Land%20Management%20and%20Physical%20Planning.pdf PDF] 1.3&lt;/ref&gt;

Over a third of U.S. households, roughly 42 million, participate in food gardening.  There has also been an increase of 63% participation in farming by millennials from 2008-2013. US households participating in community gardening has also tripled from 1 to 3 million in that time frame. Urban agriculture provides unique opportunities to bridge diverse communities together. In addition, it provides opportunities for health care providers to interact with their patients. Thus, making each community garden a hub that is reflective of the community. &lt;ref&gt;Alaimo, K., Beavers, A.W., Crawford, C. et al. Curr Envir Health Rpt (2016) 3: 302. https://doi.org/10.1007/s40572-016-0105-0
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Energy efficiency===

The current [[industrial agriculture]] system is accountable for high [[energy economics|energy costs]] for the [[transportation]] of foodstuffs. According to a study by Rich Pirog, the associate director of the Leopold Center for Sustainable Agriculture at Iowa State University, the average conventional produce item travels {{convert|1500|mi}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.leopold.iastate.edu/pubs/staff/files/food_travel072103.pdf |title=Pirog, R. and A.

''"Checking the food odometer: Comparing food miles for local versus conventional produce sales to Iowa institutions"'', Leopold Center for Sustainable Agriculture, 2003 |publisher=Leopold.iastate.edu |accessdate=1 April 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120514150840/http://www.leopold.iastate.edu/pubs/staff/files/food_travel072103.pdf |archive-date=14 May 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; using, if shipped by [[tractor-trailer]], {{convert|1|USgal}} of fossil fuel per {{convert|100|lb}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/03/07/AR2008030702520.html | work=The Washington Post | title=Eat Locally, Ease Climate Change Globally | date=9 March 2008 | accessdate=27 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The energy used to transport food is decreased when urban agriculture can provide cities with locally grown food. Pirog found that traditional, non-local, food distribution system used 4 to 17 times more fuel and emitted 5 to 17 times more {{CO2}} than the local and [[Regional Transportation Plan|regional transport]].&lt;ref&gt;Pirog, Rich S.; Van Pelt, Timothy; Enshayan, Kamyar; and Cook, Ellen, "Food, Fuel, and Freeways: An Iowa perspective on how far food travels, fuel usage, and greenhouse gas emissions" (2001). Leopold Center Pubs and Papers. 3. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://lib.dr.iastate.edu/leopold_pubspapers/3&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, in a study by Marc Xuereb and Region of Waterloo Public Health, they estimated that switching to locally grown food could save transport-related emissions equivalent to nearly 50,000 metric tons of {{CO2}}, or the equivalent of taking 16,191 cars off the road.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2005"&gt;Xuereb, Marc.

===Carbon footprint===
As mentioned above, the energy-efficient nature of urban agriculture can reduce each city's [[carbon footprint]] by reducing the amount of transport that occurs to deliver goods to the consumer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.delta-institute.org/content/urban-agriculture Delta Institute, "Urban Agriculture."] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928072314/http://www.delta-institute.org/content/urban-agriculture |date=28 September 2013 }} Web. 25 March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, these areas can act as [[carbon sink]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rowe|first=D. Bradley|title=Green roofs as a means of pollution abatement|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0269749110004859|journal=Environmental Pollution|volume=159|issue=8–9|pages=2100–2110|doi=10.1016/j.envpol.2010.10.029|pmid=21074914|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; offsetting some of the carbon accumulation that is innate to urban areas, where pavement and buildings outnumber plants. Plants absorb atmospheric carbon dioxide ({{CO2}}) and release breathable oxygen (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) through [[photosynthesis]]. The process of [[Carbon Sequestration]] can be further improved by combining other agriculture techniques to increase removal from the atmosphere and prevent the release of {{CO2}} during harvest time. However, this process relies heavily on the types of plants selected and the methodology of farming.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2005"/&gt; Specifically, choosing plants that do not lose their leaves and [[evergreen|remain green all year]] can increase the farm's ability to sequester carbon.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2005"/&gt;

===Reduction in ozone and particulate matter===
The reduction in [[ozone]] and other [[particulate matter]] can benefit human health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/s1352-2310(99)00144-2 |title=Air pollution in cities |journal=Atmospheric Environment |volume=33 |issue=24–25 |pages=4029–37 |year=1999 |last1=Mayer |first1=Helmut |bibcode=1999AtmEn..33.4029M }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Reducing these particulates and ozone gases could reduce [[mortality rate]]s in urban areas along with increase the health of those living in cities. Just to give one example, in the article “[[Green roof]]s as a means of pollution abatement,” the author argues that a rooftop containing 2000 m² of uncut [[grass]] has the potential to remove up to 4000&amp;nbsp;kg of particulate matter. According to the article, only one square meter of green roof is needed to offset the annual particulate matter emissions of a car.&lt;ref&gt;Environmental Affairs Department, City of Los Angeles. 2006. "Green Roofs - Cooling Los Angeles: A Resource Guide". http://environmentla.org/pdf/EnvironmentalBusinessProgs/Green%20Roofs%20Resource%20Guide%202007.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.envpol.2010.10.029 |pmid=21074914 |title=Green roofs as a means of pollution abatement |journal=Environmental Pollution |volume=159 |issue=8–9 |pages=2100–10 |year=2011 |last1=Rowe |first1=D. Bradley }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Soil decontamination===
Vacant urban lots are often victim to illegal dumping of hazardous chemicals and other wastes. They are also liable to accumulate standing water and “[[grey water]]”, which can be dangerous to public health, especially left stagnant for long periods. The implementation of urban agriculture in these vacant lots can be a cost-effective method for removing these chemicals. In the process known as [[Phytoremediation]], plants and the associated microorganisms are selected for their chemical ability to degrade, absorb, convert to an inert form, and remove toxins from the soil.&lt;ref&gt;Black, H. "Absorbing Possibilities: Phytoremediation." Environ Health Perspectives 103.12 (1995): 1106-108.&lt;/ref&gt;  Several chemicals can be targeted for removal including heavy metals (e.g. Mercury and lead) inorganic compounds (e.g. Arsenic and Uranium), and organic compounds (e.g. petroleum and chlorinated compounds like PBC's).&lt;ref&gt;Comis, Don. (2000). "Phytoremediation: Using Plants To Clean Up Soils." Agricultural Research: n. pag. Phytoremediation: Using Plants To Clean Up Soils. USDA-ARS, 13 August 2004. Web. 25 March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Phytoremeditation is both an environmentally friendly, cost-effective, and energy-efficient measure to reduce pollution. Phytoremediation only costs about $5–$40 per ton of [[soil decontamination|soil being decontaminated]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lasat | first1 = M.

(2004). "Junk-greedy Greens: phytoremediation as a new option for soil decontamination,"] BioTech J. '''2''': 61-67&lt;/ref&gt; Implementation of this process also reduces the amount of soil that must be disposed of in a hazardous waste landfill.&lt;ref name="phytoremediation1995"&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=8747015 |pmc=1519251 |year=1995 |author1=Black |first1=H |title=Absorbing possibilities: Phytoremediation |journal=Environmental Health Perspectives |volume=103 |issue=12 |pages=1106–8 |doi=10.2307/3432605|jstor=3432605 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Urban agriculture as a method to mediate chemical pollution can be effective in preventing the spread of these chemicals into the surrounding environment. Other methods of remediation often disturb the soil and force the chemicals contained within it into the air or water. Plants can be used as a method to remove chemicals and also to hold the soil and prevent erosion of contaminated soil decreasing the spread of pollutants and the hazard presented by these lots.&lt;ref name="phytoremediation1995"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://water.epa.gov/polwaste/nps/urban.cfm |title=Managing Urban Runoff &amp;#124; Polluted Runoff &amp;#124; US EPA |publisher=Water.epa.gov |accessdate=1 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One way of identifying soil contamination is through using already well-established plants as bioindicators of soil health. Using well-studied plants is important because there has already been substantial bodies of work to test them in various conditions, so responses can be verified with certainty. Such plants are also valuable because they are genetically identical as crops as opposed to natural variants of the same species. Typically urban soil has had the topsoil stripped away and has led to soil with low aeration, porosity, and drainage. Typical measures of soil health are microbial biomass and activity, enzymes, [[soil organic matter]] (SOM), total nitrogen, available nutrients, porosity, aggregate stability, and compaction. A new measurement is active carbon (AC), which is the most usable portoin of the total organic carbon (TOC) in the soil. This contributes greatly to the functionality of the soil food web. Using common crops, which are generally well-studied, as bioindicators an be used to effectively test the quality of an urban farming plot before beginning planting. &lt;ref&gt;Alaimo K, Beavers AW, Crawford C, et al. (2016) Amplifying Health Through Community Gardens: A Framework for Advancing Multicomponent, Behaviorally Based Neighborhood Interventions. Current Environmental Health Reports 3:302–312. doi: 10.1007/s40572-016-0105-0&lt;/ref&gt;

===Noise pollution===
Large amounts of [[noise pollution]] not only lead to lower property values and high frustration, they can be damaging to human hearing and health.&lt;ref name=pass&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Passchier-Vermeer | first1 = W. | last2 = Passchier | first2 = W.F. | year = 2000 | title = Noise exposure and public health | doi = 10.1289/ehp.00108s1123 | pmid = 10698728 | pmc = 1637786 | journal = Environmental Health Perspectives | volume = 108 | issue = 1| pages = 123–131 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the study “Noise exposure and public health,” they argue that exposure to continual noise is a public health problem. They cite examples of the detriment of continual noise on humans to include: “hearing impairment, hypertension and ischemic heart disease, annoyance, sleep disturbance, and decreased school performance.” Since most roofs or vacant lots consist of hard flat surfaces that reflect sound waves instead of absorbing them, adding plants that can absorb these waves has the potential to lead to a vast [[Noise control|reduction in noise pollution]].&lt;ref name=pass /&gt;

===Nutrition and quality of food===
Daily intake of a variety of fruits and vegetables is linked to a decreased risk of chronic diseases including diabetes, heart disease, and cancer. Urban agriculture is associated with increased consumption of fruits and vegetables &lt;ref name="autogenerated94"&gt;Alaimo, K., Packnett, E., Miles, R., Kruger, D. (2008). "Fruit and Vegetable Intake among Urban Community Gardeners". Journal of Nutrition Education and Behavior. (1499-4046),40 (2), p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt; which decreases risk for disease and can be a cost-effective way to provide citizens with quality, fresh produce in urban settings.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2004"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://foodsecurity.org |author=Bellows, Anne C., Katherine Brown, Jac Smit |title= "Health Benefits of Urban Agriculture" (paper and research conducted by members of the Community Food Security Coalition's North American Initiative on Urban Agriculture) |publisher=Foodsecurity.org |accessdate=1 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref name="autogenerated94"/&gt; Produce from urban gardens can be perceived to be more flavorful and desirable than store bought produce&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.socscimed.2011.03.044 |pmid=21596466 |pmc=3114166 |title=Connecting food environments and health through the relational nature of aesthetics: Gaining insight through the community gardening experience |journal=Social Science &amp; Medicine |volume=72 |issue=11 |pages=1853–63 |year=2011 |last1=Hale |first1=James |last2=Knapp |first2=Corrine |last3=Bardwell |first3=Lisa |last4=Buchenau |first4=Michael |last5=Marshall |first5=Julie |last6=Sancar |first6=Fahriye |last7=Litt |first7=Jill S. }}&lt;/ref&gt; which may also lead to a wider acceptance and higher intake. A Flint, Michigan study found that those participating in community gardens consumed fruits and vegetables 1.4 more times per day and were 3.5 times more likely to consume fruits or vegetables at least 5 times daily (p.&amp;nbsp;1).&lt;ref name="autogenerated94"/&gt;  Garden-based education can also yield nutritional benefits in children. An Idaho study reported a positive association between school gardens and increased intake of fruit, vegetables, vitamin A, vitamin C and fiber among sixth graders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jada.2007.01.015 |pmid=17383272 |title=Garden-Based Nutrition Education Affects Fruit and Vegetable Consumption in Sixth-Grade Adolescents |journal=Journal of the American Dietetic Association |volume=107 |issue=4 |pages=662–5 |year=2007 |last1=McAleese |first1=Jessica D. |last2=Rankin |first2=Linda L. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Harvesting fruits and vegetables initiates the enzymatic process of nutrient degradation which is especially detrimental to water [[vitamins|soluble vitamin]]s such as [[ascorbic acid]] and [[thiamin]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated2007"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/jsfa.2825 |title=Nutritional comparison of fresh, frozen and canned fruits and vegetables. Part 1. Vitamins C and B and phenolic compounds |journal=Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture |volume=87 |issue=6 |pages=930–44 |year=2007 |last1=Rickman |first1=Joy C |last2=Barrett |first2=Diane M |last3=Bruhn |first3=Christine M }}&lt;/ref&gt; The process of blanching produce in order to freeze or can reduce nutrient content slightly but not nearly as much as the amount of time spent in storage.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2007"/&gt; Harvesting produce from one's own community garden cuts back on storage times significantly.

Urban agriculture also provides quality nutrition for low-income households. Studies show that every $1 invested in a community garden yields $6 worth of vegetables if labor is not considered a factor in investment.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2004"/&gt; Many urban gardens reduce the strain on food banks and other emergency food providers by donating shares of their harvest and provide fresh produce in areas that otherwise might be food deserts. The supplemental nutrition program Women, Infants and Children (WIC) as well as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) have partnered with several urban gardens nationwide to improve the accessibility to produce in exchange for a few hours of volunteer gardening work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/s0002-8223(08)70150-0 |title=Urban Gardening Yields Benefits for Low Income Families |journal=Journal of the American Dietetic Association |volume=103 |pages=94–5 |year=2003 |last1=Swartz |first1=S.H. |last2=Ranum |first2=O.J. |last3=Phillips |first3=O.K. |last4=Cavanaugh |first4=J.J. |last5=Bennett |first5=A.E. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Urban farming has been shown to increase health outcomes. Gardeners consume twice as much fruit and vegetables than non-gardeners. Levels of physical activity are also positively associated with urban farming. These results are seen indirectly and can be supported by the social involvement in an individual's community as a member of the community farm. This social involvement helped raised the aesthetic appeal of the neighborhood, boosting the motivation or efficacy of the community as a whole. This increased efficacy was shown to increase neighborhood attachment. Therefore, the positive health outcomes of urban farming can be explained in part due to the interpersonal sand social factors that boost health. Focusing on improving the aesthetics and community relationships and not only on the plant yield, is the best way to maximize the positive effect of urban farms on a neighborhood. &lt;ref&gt;Litt, J.s., et al. “Exploring Ecological, Emotional and Social Levers of Self-Rated Health for Urban Gardeners and Non-Gardeners: A Path Analysis.” Social Science &amp; Medicine, vol. 144, 2015, pp. 1–8., doi:10.1016/j.socscimed.2015.09.004.
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economy of scale===
Using high-density urban farming, as for instance with [[vertical farms]] or stacked greenhouses, many environmental benefits can be achieved on a citywide scale that would be impossible otherwise. These systems do not only provide food, but also produce potable water from waste water, and can [[recycle]] organic waste back to energy and nutrients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Tom Bosschaert |url=http://www.except.nl/consult/largescaleurbanargriculture/largescaleurbanagriculture1.html |title=Bosschaert, T ''"Large Scale Urban agriculture Essay"'', Except Consultancy, 2007 |publisher=Except.nl |date=15 December 2007 |accessdate=1 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, they can reduce food-related transportation to a minimum while providing fresh food for large communities in almost any climate.

===Health inequalities and food justice===
A 2009 report by the USDA, determined that "Evidence is both abundant and robust enough for us to conclude that Americans living in low-income and minority areas tend to have poor access to healthy food", and that the "structural inequalities" in these neighborhoods "contribute to inequalities in diet and diet-related outcomes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=USDA|author2=Economic Research Service|title=Access to Affordable and Nutritious Food: Measuring and Understanding Food Deserts and Their Consequences: A Report to Congress.|journal=Administrative Publication No. (AP-036)|date=June 2009|page=160|url=http://www.ers.usda.gov/publications/ap-administrative-publication/ap-036.aspx#.UVH-XehVfog|accessdate=28 March 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130406185309/http://www.ers.usda.gov/publications/ap-administrative-publication/ap-036.aspx#.UVH-XehVfog|archive-date=6 April 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These diet-related outcomes, including obesity and diabetes, have become epidemic in low-income urban environments in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Designed for Disease: The Link Between Local Food Environments and Obesity and Diabetes. [[California Center for Public Health Advocacy]], PolicyLink, and the UCLA Center for Health Policy Research. April 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the definition and methods for determining "[[food deserts]]" have varied, studies indicate that, at least in the United States,  there are racial disparities in the food environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/0739456X08317461 |title=Beyond Food Deserts: Measuring and Mapping Racial Disparities in Neighborhood Food Environments |journal=Journal of Planning Education and Research |volume=27 |issue=4 |pages=469–82 |year=2008 |last1=Raja |first1=S. |last2=Changxing Ma |last3=Yadav |first3=P. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus using the definition of environment as the place where people live, work, play and pray, food disparities become an issue of environmental justice.&lt;ref name="Cultivating Food Justice - Growing Food and Justice"&gt;{{cite book |title=Cultivating Food Justice: Race, Class, and Sustainability|year=2011|publisher=MIT Press |isbn=9780262300223|pages=149–177 |author=Morales, Alfonso |editor1=Alison Hope Alkon |editor2=Julian Agyeman |chapter=Growing Food and Justice: Dismantling Racism through Sustainable Food Systems}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is especially true in American inner-cities where a history of racist practices have contributed to the development of food deserts in the low-income, minority areas of the urban core.&lt;ref name="cultivating food justice - from industrial garden"&gt;{{cite book|title=Cultivating Food Justice: Race, Class, and Sustainability|year=2011|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=9780262300223|pages=89–121|author=Nathan McClintock|editor1=Alison Hope Alkon |editor2=Julian Agyeman |chapter=From Industrial Garden to Food Desert: Demarcated Devaluation in the Flatlands of Oakland, California}}&lt;/ref&gt; The issue of inequality is so integral to the issues of food access and health that the Growing Food &amp; Justice for All Initiative was founded with the mission of “dismantling racism” as an integral part of creating food security.&lt;ref name="growing food and justice for all"&gt;{{cite web|title=Growing Food and Justice for All|url=http://www.growingfoodandjustice.org/About_Us.html|accessdate=28 March 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130315104816/http://www.growingfoodandjustice.org/About_Us.html|archive-date=15 March 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not only can urban agriculture provide healthy, fresh food options, but also can contribute to a sense of community, aesthetic improvement, crime reduction, minority empowerment and autonomy, and even preserve culture through the use of farming methods and heirloom seeds preserved from areas of origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Cultivating Food Justice: Race, Class, and Sustainability |year=2011 |publisher=MIT Press|pages=197–221|author=Teresa M. Mares, Devon G. Pena |editor=Alison Hope Alkon, Julian Agyeman |chapter=Environmental and Food Justice: Toward Local, Slow, and Deep Food Systems}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environmental justice===
Urban agriculture may advance [[environmental justice]] and food justice for communities living in food deserts.&lt;ref name="Boeing2016" /&gt;  First, urban agriculture may reduce racial and class disparities in access to healthy food. When urban agriculture leads to locally grown fresh produce sold at affordable prices in food deserts, access to healthy food is not just available for those who live in wealthy areas, thereby leading to greater equity in rich and poor neighborhoods.&lt;ref name="MCC"/&gt;
 
Improved access to food through urban agriculture can also help alleviate psychosocial stresses in poor communities. Community members engaged in urban agriculture improve local knowledge about healthy ways to fulfill dietary needs. Urban agriculture can also better the mental health of community members. Buying and selling quality products to local producers and consumers allows community members to support one another, which may reduce stress. Thus, urban agriculture can help improve conditions in poor communities, where residents experience higher levels of stress due to a perceived lack of control over the quality of their lives.&lt;ref name="4Sapolsky"&gt;[[Robert Sapolsky|Sapolsky, Robert]], "Sick of Poverty," Scientific American, Dec. 2005, pp: 93-99.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Urban agriculture may improve the livability and built environment in communities that lack supermarkets and other infrastructure due to the presence of high unemployment caused by [[deindustrialization]]. Urban farmers who follow sustainable agriculture methods can not only help to build local food system infrastructure, but can also contribute to improving local air, and water and soil quality.&lt;ref name="2GOTTLIEB"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1089/env.2009.0001 |title=Where We Live, Work, Play . . . And Eat: Expanding the Environmental Justice Agenda |journal=Environmental Justice |volume=2 |pages=7–8 |year=2009 |last1=Gottlieb |first1=Robert }}&lt;/ref&gt; When agricultural products are produced locally within the community, they do not need to be transported, which reduces [[Carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere|{{CO2}} emission]] rates and other pollutants that contribute to high rates of [[asthma]] in lower socioeconomic areas. Sustainable urban agriculture can also promote worker protection and consumer rights.&lt;ref name="2GOTTLIEB"/&gt; For example, communities in [[New York City]], [[Illinois]], and [[Richmond, Virginia]] have demonstrated improvements to their local environments through urban agricultural practices.&lt;ref name="3ACC"&gt;Alternatives for Community &amp; Environment. Environmental Justice and the Green Economy. A Vision Statement and Case Studies for Just and Sustainable Solutions. Rep. Roxbury, MA: Alternatives for Community &amp; Environment, 2010. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
However, urban agriculture can also present urban growers with health risks if the soil used for urban farming is contaminated. Although local produce is often believed to be clean and healthy, many urban farmers ranging from New York urban farmer Frank Meushke &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/14/garden/14lead.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0 Murphy, Kate.

Web. 9 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; have found their products contained high levels of [[Lead poisoning|lead]], due to [[soil contamination]], which is harmful to human health when consumed. The soil contaminated with high lead levels often originates from old house paint which contained lead, [[vehicle exhaust]], or atmospheric deposition. Without proper education on the risks of urban farming and safe practices, urban consumers of urban agricultural produce may face additional health-related issues&lt;ref name="MCC"&gt;McClintock, Nathan.

[[File:Urban agriculture in Amsterdam.jpg|thumb|left|A small urban farm in [[Amsterdam]]]]
[[File:Foodrooffarm.jpg|thumb|Rooftop urban farming at the Food Roof Farm in downtown St. Louis, MO]]
Creating a community-based infrastructure for urban agriculture means establishing local systems to grow and process food and transfer it from farmer ([[Production, costs, and pricing|producer]]) to [[consumer]].&lt;ref name="Boeing2016" /&gt;

To facilitate food production, cities have established community-based farming projects. Some projects have collectively tended community farms on [[common land]], much like that of eighteenth-century [[Boston Common (park)|Boston Common]]. One such community farm is the [[Collingwood Children's Farm]] in [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]]. Other community garden projects use the [[allotment garden]] model, in which gardeners care for individual plots in a larger gardening area, often sharing a tool shed and other amenities. Seattle's [[P-Patch]] gardens use this model, as did the [[South Central Farm]] in Los Angeles and the Food Roof Farm in St. Louis. Independent urban gardeners also grow food in individual yards and on roofs. [[Garden sharing]] projects seek to pair producers with the land, typically, residential yard space. [[Roof gardens]] allow for urban dwellers to maintain green spaces in the city without having to set aside a tract of undeveloped land. Rooftop farms allow otherwise unused industrial roofspace to be used productively, creating work and profit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/new-york-could-grown-all-its-own-food-180949748/? | title=New York Could Grow All Its Own Food.

[[Food processing]] on a community level has been accommodated by centralizing resources in community tool sheds and processing facilities for farmers to share. The Garden Resource Program Collaborative based in Detroit has cluster tool banks. Different areas of the city have tool banks where resources like tools, [[compost]], mulch, tomato stakes, seeds, and education can be shared and distributed with the gardeners in that cluster. Detroit's Garden Resource Program Collaborative also strengthens their gardening community by providing to their member's transplants; education on gardening, policy, and food issues; and by building connectivity between gardeners through workgroups, potlucks, tours, field trips, and cluster workdays. In Brazil, "Cities Without Hunger" has generated a public policy for the reconstruction of abandoned areas with food production and has improved the green areas of the community.

[[Farmers' market]]s, such as the [[Farmers Market (Los Angeles)|farmers' market in Los Angeles]], provide a common land where farmers can sell their product to consumers. Large cities tend to open their farmer's markets on the weekends and one day in the middle of the week. For example, the farmers' market of [[Boulevard Richard-Lenoir]] in [[Paris, France]], is open on Sundays and Thursdays. However, to create a consumer dependency on urban agriculture and to introduce local food production as a sustainable career for farmers, markets would have to be open regularly. For example, the Los Angeles Farmers' Market is open seven days a week and has linked several local grocers together to provide different food products. The market's central location in downtown Los Angeles provides the perfect interaction for a diverse group of sellers to access their consumers.

===Queensland, Australia===
In Queensland many people have started a trend of urban farming both utilizing [[Aquaponics]] and self-watering containers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.futuredirections.org.au/publication/localising-food-production-urban-agriculture-in-australia/ | title=Localising Food Production: Urban Agriculture in Australia| date=2015-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cairo, Egypt===
In Egypt, development of rooftop gardens began in the 1990s. In the early 1990s at [[Ain Shams University]], a group of agriculture professors developed an initiative focused on growing organic vegetables to suit densely populated cities of Egypt. The initiative was applied on a small scale; until it was officially adopted in 2001, by the Food and Agriculture Organization ([[FAO]]).&lt;ref&gt;Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.

{{main article|Organopónicos}}

After the disintegration of the [[Soviet Union]] and the [[Eastern Bloc]], [[Cuba]] faced severe shortages of fuel and [[agrochemical|agrochemical inputs]]. These products had previously been imported from the Soviet Union in exchange for Cuban sugar. As a result, Cubans experienced an acute food crisis in the early 1990s, which in part was met with a popular movement of urban agriculture. Urban farmers employed – and still employ –
[[agroecology|agroecological]] techniques, allowing food production to take place largely without petroleum-based inputs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s10460-015-9659-y |title=Low-carbon food supply: The ecological geography of Cuban urban agriculture and agroecological theory |journal=Agriculture and Human Values |volume=33 |issue=4 |pages=771–784 |year=2016 |last1=Cederlöf |first1=Gustav |url=https://kclpure.kcl.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/lowcarbon-food-supply(91a7f323-379c-4eeb-b2c8-c6bfe94ea449).html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, {{convert|35000|acre}} of urban gardens produced {{convert|3400000|short ton}} of food. In Havana, 90% of the city's fresh produce come from local urban farms and gardens. In 2003, more than 200,000 Cubans worked in the expanding urban agriculture sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=cubaagriculture.com |url=http://www.cubaagriculture.com/agriculture-today.htm |title=Cuban Ministry of Agriculture |publisher=Cubaagriculture.com |accessdate=1 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mumbai, India===
Economic development in [[Mumbai]] brought a growth in population caused mainly by the migration of laborers from other regions of the country. The number of residents in the city increased more than twelve times in the last century. [[Greater Mumbai]], formed by [[South Mumbai|City Island]] and [[Salsette Island]], is the largest city in India with a population of 16.4 million, according to data collected by the census of 2001. Mumbai is one of the densest cities in the world, 48,215 persons per km² and 16,082 per km² in suburban areas. In this scenario, urban agriculture seems unlikely to be put into practice since it must compete with real estate developers for the access and use of vacant lots. Alternative farming methods have emerged as a response to the scarcity of land, water, and economic resources employed in UPA.

Dr. Doshi's city garden methods are revolutionary for being appropriate to apply in reduced spaces as terraces and balconies, even on civil construction walls, and for not requiring big investments in capital or long hours of work. His farming practice is purely organic and is mainly directed to domestic consumption. His gardening tools are composed of materials available in the local environment: sugarcane waste, polyethylene bags, tires, containers and cylinders, and soil. The containers and bags (open at both ends) are filled with the sugarcane stalks, compost, and garden soil, which make possible the use of a minimal quantity of water is compared to open fields. Dr. Doshi states that solar energy can replace soil in cities. He also recommends the idea of chain planning, or growing plants in intervals and in small quantities rather than at once and in large amounts. He has grown different types of fruit such as mangos, figs, guavas, bananas, and sugarcane stalks in his terrace of {{convert|1200|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} in Bandra. The concept of [[city farm]]ing developed by Dr. Doshi consumes the entire household's organic waste. He subsequently makes the household self-sufficient in the provision of food: {{convert|5|kg}} of fruits and vegetables are produced daily for 300 days a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iwmi.cgiar.org/southasia/ruaf/CD/ho1.html |title=RUAF Foundation. ''Handouts on Case Studies'' |publisher=Iwmi.cgiar.org |date=11 January 2010 |accessdate=1 April 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718024007/http://www.iwmi.cgiar.org/southasia/ruaf/CD/ho1.html |archive-date=18 July 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main objectives of a pilot project at city farm at Rosary High School, Dockyard Road, were to promote economic support for street children, beautify the city landscape, supply locally produced organic food to urban dwellers (mainly those residing in slums), and to manage organic waste in a sustainable city. The project was conducted in the Rosary School, in Mumbai, with the participation of street children during 2004. A city farm was created in a terrace area of {{convert|400|sqft|m2|abbr=on}}. The participants were trained in urban farming techniques. The farm produced vegetables, fruits, and flowers. The idea has spread the concept of city farm to other schools in the city.

The Mumbai Port Trust (MBPT) central kitchen distributes food to approximately 3,000 employees daily, generating important amounts of organic disposal. A terrace garden created by the staff recycles ninety percent of this waste in the production of vegetables and fruits. Preeti Patil, who is the catering officer at the MBPT explains the purpose of the enterprise:&lt;ref&gt;Roshni Udyavar et al., "Development of City Farms by Street Children"&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Mumbai Port Trust has developed an organic farm on the terrace of its central kitchen, which is an area of approximately {{convert|3000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}}. The activity of city farming was started initially to dispose of kitchen organic waste in an eco-friendly way. Staff members, after their daily work in the kitchen, tend the garden, which has about 150 plants.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Bangkok, Thailand===
In early 2000, urban gardens were started under the direction of the NGO, Thailand Environment Institute (TEI), to help achieve the Bangkok Metropolitan Administrations (BMA) priority to "green" Thailand. With a population of 12 million and 39% of the land in the city vacant due to rapid expansion of the 1960s–80s Bangkok is a test bed for urban gardens centered on community involvement.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The two urban gardens initiated by TEI are in Bangkok Noi and Bangkapi and the main tasks were stated as:
* Teach members of the communities the benefits of urban green space.
* Create the social framework to plan, implement, and maintain the urban green space.
* Create a process of a method to balance the needs of the community with the needs of the larger environmental concerns.

While the goals of the NGO are important in a global context, the community goals are being met through the work of forming the urban gardens themselves. In this sense, the creation, implementation, and maintenance of urban gardens are highly determined by the desires of the communities involved. However, the criteria by which TEI measured their success illustrates the scope of benefits to a community which practices urban agriculture. TEI's success indicators were:
* Establishing an Urban Green Plan
* Community Capacity Building
* Poverty Reduction
* Links with Government
* Developing a Model for Other Communities

===China===
Beijing's increase in land area from {{convert|4822|km2}} in 1956 to {{convert|16808|km2}} in 1958 led to the increased adoption of peri-urban agriculture. Such "suburban agriculture" led to more than 70% of non-staple food in Beijing, mainly consisting of vegetables and milk, to be produced by the city itself in the 1960s and 1970s. Recently, with relative food security in China, periurban agriculture has led to improvements in the quality of the food available, as opposed to quantity. One of the more recent experiments in urban agriculture is the Modern Agricultural Science Demonstration Park in Xiaotangshan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Jianming | first = Cai | title = Periurban Agriculture Development in China | journal = Urban Agriculture Magazine | volume = 9 | date = 1 April 2003 | url = http://www.ruaf.org/system/files?file=Periurban%20Agriculture%20Development%20in%20China.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 12 July 2007 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927195253/http://www.ruaf.org/system/files?file=Periurban%20Agriculture%20Development%20in%20China.pdf | archivedate = 27 September 2007 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, Chinese cities have been known to mix agricultural activities within the urban setting. Shenzhen, once a small farming community, is now a fast-growing metropolis due to the Chinese government designation as an open economic zone. Due to large and growing population in China, the government supports urban self-sufficiency in food production. Shenzhen's village structure, sustainable methods, and new agricultural advancements initiated by the government have been strategically configured to supply food for this growing city.&lt;ref name="Pepall, Jennifer 1997"&gt;Pepall, Jennifer. New Challenges for Chinas Urban Farms IDRC Report (1997) 21.3&lt;/ref&gt;

The city farms are located about {{convert|10|km}} from the city center in a two-tier system. The first tier approached from city center produces perishable items. Located just outside these farms, hardier vegetables are grown such as potatoes, carrots, and onions. This system allows producers to be sold in city markets just a few short hours after picking.

Another impressive method used in Chinese agriculture and aquaculture practice is the mulberry-dike fish-pond system, which is a response to waste recycling and soil fertility. This system can be described as:&lt;ref name="Pepall, Jennifer 1997"/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Mulberry trees are grown to feed silkworms and the silkworm waste is fed to the fish in ponds. The fish also feed on waste from other animals, such as pigs, poultry, and buffalo. The animals, in turn, are given crops that have been fertilized by mud from the ponds. This is a sophisticated system as a continuous cycle of water, waste, and food...with a man built into the picture.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As the population grows and industry advances, the city tries to incorporate potential agricultural growth by experimenting with new agricultural methods. The Fong Lau Chee Experimental Farm in Dongguan, Guangdong has worked with new agricultural advancements in lychee production. This farm was established with aspirations of producing large quantities and high-quality lychees, by constantly monitoring sugar content, and their seeds. This research, conducted by local agricultural universities allows for new methods to be used with hopes of reaching the needs of city consumers.&lt;ref&gt;Yeung, Yue-man. Urban Agriculture Research in East and Southeast Asia: Record, Capacities, and Opportunities Cities Feeding People CFP Report 6 (1993) The Chinese University of Hong Kong&lt;/ref&gt;

However, due to increased levels of economic growth and pollution, some urban farms have become threatened. The government has been trying to step in and create new technological advancements within the agricultural field to sustain levels of urban agriculture.

"The city plans to invest 8.82 billion yuan in 39 agricultural projects, including a safe agricultural base, an agricultural high-tech park, agricultural processing and distribution, forestry, eco-agricultural tourism, which will form an urban agriculture with typical Shenzhen characteristics" in conjunction with this program the city is expected to expand the Buji Farm Produce Wholesale Market.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.sz.gov.cn/economy/200708/t20070824_229911.htm Shenzhen Government Online Economic Structure: Urban Agriculture 2007] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080416053328/http://english.sz.gov.cn/economy/200708/t20070824_229911.htm |date=16 April 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Municipal Bureau of Agriculture, Forestry and Fishery the city will invest 600 million yuan on farms located around the city, with hopes of the farms to provide "60 percent of the meat, vegetables, and aquatic products in the Shenzhen market".&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.sz.gov.cn/In/200610/t20061027_148990.htm Shenzhen Government Online SZ farms to feed city residents Local News]{{dead link|date=April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There has also been an emerging trend of going green and organic as a response to pollution and pesticides used in farming practices. Vegetable suppliers are required to pass certain inspections held by the city's Agriculture Bureau before they can be sold as "green".&lt;ref&gt;Shenzhen Government Online Shenzhen store embrace green 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Harare, Zimbabwe===
Harare is particularly suited for urban agriculture, as its topography heavily features ''vleis'', land drainage systems that become waterlogged in the rainy season. When it rains they are difficult to cross, and in the dry season they shrink and crack, which causes structural damage to infrastructure, even though the vleis are still storing water underground. Therefore, these moisture-rich areas are mostly left unbuilt, allowing for urban cultivation.

Aside from vleis and the private residential land that Harareans cultivate, considerable public land is used for agriculture in Harare: along public roads, railway lines, undeveloped plots, road verges, and the banks of ditches.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mudimu|first=Godfrey|date=1996|title=Urban Agricultural Activities and Women's Strategies in Sustaining Family Livelihoods in Harare, Zimbabwe|url=|journal=Singapore Journal of Tropical Geography|volume=17|pages=179–194|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Drakakis-Smith|first=David|date=1995|title=Urban Poverty and Urban Agriculture: An Overview of the Linkages in Harare|url=|journal=Habitat International|volume=19|pages=183–193|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The land is mostly used for maize, groundnuts, sweet potatoes, green vegetables, fruits, paprika, and flowers.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mbiba|first=Beacon|title=City Harvests: Urban and Peri-Urban Agriculture in Harare, Zimbabwe|url=https://www.academia.edu/9507035|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;This unsanctioned cultivation has a history of necessity: in colonial times, laborers wanted towns where they could cultivate crops like at their rural homes, and with very low income, needed to supplement their food supply.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mbiba|first=Beacon|date=1994|title=Institutional Responses to Uncontrolled Urban Cultivation in Harare: Prohibitive or Accommodative?|url=|journal=Environment and Urbanization|volume=6|pages=188–202|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, urban agriculture in Harare causes harm to the environment. The practice has reduced rainwater infiltration into the soil by 28.5 percent and lowered tree species diversity.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In addition, most informal urban farmers use harmful chemical fertilizers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shingirai|first=Chimbwanda|date=2014-07-25|title=Contribution of urban crop production to household food security: a study of urban agriculture in Warren Park suburb of Harare|url=http://ir.uz.ac.zw/handle/10646/1294?show=full|language=en-ZW}}&lt;/ref&gt; Urban agriculture has also been viewed negatively in Harare because it impedes on housing and urban development. In the eyes of Zimbabwean laws, agriculture was not an “urban” activity or a legitimate form of land use in cities.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In 1983, the Greater Harare Illegal Cultivation Committee was formed, though its efforts to curb urban agriculture wholly failed.

In the 1990s, the failure of Structural Adjustment Programs induced greater unemployment, higher prices, and lower incomes, so more people started growing their own food.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ruaf.org/sites/default/files/UAM21%20p.26-27.pdf|title=The Impact of the Economic Meltdown on Urban Agriculture in Harare|last=Toriro|first=Percy|date=January 2009|work=Urban Agriculture|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1990 and 1994, Harare's cultivation area increased by 92.6 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/286348362|title=CONFLICTS, CONTESTATION, AND MARGINALIZATION IN URBAN AGRICULTURE: EXPERIENCES FROM KUWADZANA EXTENSION, HARARE (PDF Download Available)|website=ResearchGate|language=en|access-date=2017-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The boom in urban agriculture improved both the food security and the nutrition of its practitioners, as well as additional income from selling excess produce. The practice continued in the 2000s when a major recession brought about widespread poverty, unemployment, and enormous inflation. Finally, the 2002 Nyanga Declaration on Urban Agriculture in Zimbabwe explicitly acknowledged the value of urban agriculture for food security and the reduction of poverty. Accepting that many people depend on it to survive, the government allocated sixty thousand hectares of land in Harare for cultivation purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chaminuka|first=Nyasha|last2=Makaye|first2=Peter|date=2015-04-23|title=The Resilience of Urban Agriculture in the Face of Adversity from the City Authorities: The Case of Mkoba|url=https://socialscienceresearch.org/index.php/GJHSS/article/view/1482|journal=Global Journal of Human-Social Science Research|language=en|issn=2249-460X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States ===

==== Nationwide Survey Findings ====
According to the [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]], a farm is defined as a location that produces and sells at least $1,000 worth of products. A study conducted on urban farms in 2012 surveyed over 315 farms that identified as urban. Of those, over 32% were found in the Northeast, more than 26% in the South, 22% in the West, and less than 19% in the Midwest. The survey found that most urban farms in the United States are structured as either non-profit or solely owned. Urban farms typically use techniques that allow them to produce intensively on small land. Mainly, these practices include raised beds, greenhouse, and [[container garden]]s. Of the products made, an overwhelming majority of urban farms focus on fresh vegetable, followed by herbs and flowers. If an urban farm focuses on animals, the primary animal is hens. Bees and sheep are the second most common urban farm animals.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www. attractive.ncat.org|title=Urban Agriculture in the United States: Baseline Findings of a Nationwide Survey|last=Oberholtzer|first=Lydia|date=November 2016|website=National Center for Appropriate Technology|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20021101093149/http://www/|archive-date=1 November 2002|dead-url=yes|access-date=|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Almost half of the urban farms that participated in the survey made a total gross sale adding to less than $10,000. The majority of these sales coming from farmers markets, [[Community-supported agriculture|Community Supported Agriculture]] (CSA), and restaurants. Not even 5% of the urban farms could be considered according to total gross sales statistics. Most urban farms agree on the main challenges that they face; production costs, managing pests, managing weeds, and climate. They also see profitability, financing, and farm labor as big challenges of managing an urban farm.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

====New York====
[[File:Lower_East_Side_in_Adam_Purple%27s_Garden_1984..jpg|thumb|left|Garden of Adam Purple, lower east-side, New York City, 1984]] Many low-income residents suffer from high rates of obesity and diabetes and limited sources of fresh produce. The City and local nonprofit groups have been providing land, training and financial encouragement, but the impetus in urban farming has really come from the farmers, who often volunteer when their regular work day is done.  In addition, the New York City Department of Environmental Protection offers a grant program for private property owners in combined sewer areas of New York City. The minimum requirement is to manage 1” of stormwater runoff from the contributing impervious area. Eligible projects include green roofs, rooftop farms, and [[rainwater harvesting]] on private property in combined sewer areas. Because of this grant program, New York City now has the world's largest rooftop farms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.treehugger.com/sustainable-agriculture/rooftop-farm-brooklyn.html|title=One of the world's largest rooftop farms is in Brooklyn|work=TreeHugger}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some urban gardeners have used empty lots to start a community or urban gardens. However, the soil must be tested for heavy contamination in city soil because of vehicle exhaust and remnants of old construction. The City also has a composting program, which is available to gardeners and farmers. One group, GreenThumb, provides free seedlings. Another program, the City Farms project operated by the nonprofit Just Food, offers courses on growing and selling food.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/07/dining/07urban.html?ex=1210824000&amp;en=9d6a23b0418d45a4&amp;ei=5070&amp;emc=eta1 Urban Farmers' Crops Go From Vacant Lot to Market]&lt;/ref&gt;

Two alternate means of growing are [[rooftop garden]]s and [[hydroponic]] (soil-less) growing. ''The New York Times'' wrote an article about one of Manhattan's first gardens which incorporate both these techniques.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/28/dining/28roof.html From Roof To Table,]&lt;/ref&gt; Another option urban gardeners have used is Farm-in-A-Box LLC, a company that provides hand-made, ready-to-use garden boxes to residents and schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.farminaboxnyc.com/|title=Welcome|website=Farm-In-A-Box|access-date=2016-04-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160430091534/http://www.farminaboxnyc.com/|archive-date=30 April 2016|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====California====
In response to the recession of 2008, a coalition of community-based organizations, farmers, and academic institutions in California's [[Pomona Valley]] formed the Pomona Valley Urban Agriculture Initiative.

After the passage of the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]], cheap grain from the United States flooded Mexico, driving peasant farmers off of their land. Many immigrated to the Pomona Valley and found work in the construction industry. With the 2008 recession, the construction industry also suffered in the region. It is unlikely to regain its former strength because of severe water shortages in this desert region as well as ongoing weakness in the local economy. These immigrants were dry land organic farmers in their home country by default since they did not have access to pesticides and petroleum-based fertilizers. Now, they found themselves on the border of two counties: Los Angeles County with a population of 10 million and almost no farmland, and San Bernardino County which has the worst access to healthy food in the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publichealthadvocacy.org|title=California Center for Public Health Advocacy|work=publichealthadvocacy.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; In both counties, there is a growing demand for locally grown organic produce. In response to these conditions, Uncommon Good, a community-based nonprofit organization that works with immigrant farmer families, convened a forum which became the Urban Farmers Association. The Urban Farmers Association is the first organization of its kind for poor immigrant farmers in the Pomona Valley. Its goal is to develop opportunities for its members to support themselves and their families through urban agriculture. With Uncommon Good, it is a founding member of the Pomona Valley Urban Agriculture Initiative (PVUAI). The PVUAI is working with local colleges and universities to expand upon a food assessment survey that was done in the City of Pomona.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.amepre.2006.01.009 |pmid=16627123 |title=Disparities in Access to Fresh Produce in Low-Income Neighborhoods in Los Angeles |journal=American Journal of Preventive Medicine |volume=30 |issue=5 |pages=365–70 |year=2006 |last1=Algert |first1=Susan J. |last2=Agrawal |first2=Aditya |last3=Lewis |first3=Douglas S. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Oakland====
{{Main article|Urban agriculture in West Oakland}}

[[Urban agriculture in West Oakland]] has taken a radical form that can be traced back to community gardening initiatives starting in the 1970s in the cities of [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]] and [[Oakland, California|Oakland]], and the city's African-American heritage.&lt;ref name="nm"&gt;McClintock, Nathan. (2011). "Cultivation, Capital, and Contamination: Urban Agriculture in Oakland, California." 2011. PDF file.&lt;/ref&gt; Oakland's manufacturing industry attracted new residents during WWII. To reduce racial tension, the Oakland Housing Authority established housing projects for blacks in West Oakland and whites in East Oakland. With exclusionary [[Covenant (law)|covenants]] and [[redlining]] by banks, development capital was kept out of West Oakland while the African-American population had limited opportunities to rent or buy housing outside West Oakland.&lt;ref name="mc"&gt;McClintock, Nathan. (2008). [http://escholarship.org/uc/item/1wh3v1sj From Industrial Garden to Food Desert: Unearthing the Root Structure of Urban Agriculture in Oakland, California.] UC Berkeley: Institute for the Study of Societal Issues.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Black Panther Party]] (BPP) played a role in seeding urban agricultural practices in West Oakland.&lt;ref name="nm" /&gt; One of its social programs aimed to improve the access to healthy food for the city's black population by providing breakfast in local schools, churches, and community centers. A small amount of this food came from small local gardens planted by BPP members. According to Prof. Nathan McClintock, "The Panthers used gardening as a coping mechanism and a means of supplementing their diets, as a well as a means to strengthen community members engaged in the struggle against oppression."&lt;ref name="nm" /&gt; The People of Color Greening Network (PCGN) was created in the 1990s. The group planted in empty and vacant lots in West Oakland. In addition, schools around Alameda County began teaching basic gardening skills and food education.&lt;ref name="nm" /&gt; Other groups have carried on those legacies, such as People's Grocery&lt;ref name="js"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s10460-012-9363-0 |title=Growing food justice by planting an anti-oppression foundation: Opportunities and obstacles for a budding social movement |journal=Agriculture and Human Values |volume=29 |issue=4 |pages=455–66 |year=2012 |last1=Sbicca |first1=Joshua }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Planting Justice.&lt;ref name="sj"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/anti.12247 |title=These Bars Can't Hold Us Back: Plowing Incarcerated Geographies with Restorative Food Justice |journal=Antipode |volume=48 |issue=5 |pages=1359–79 |year=2016 |last1=Sbicca |first1=Joshua }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, the city of Oakland's Mayor's Office of Sustainability proposed a Sustainable Community Development Initiative towards sustainable development.&lt;ref&gt;Floyd, Ceda [http://www2.oaklandnet.com/oakca/groups/pwa/documents/report/oak025325.pdf "Resolution Authorizing The City Of Oakland To Adopt Part Three Of The 'City Of Oakland Sustainable Community Development Initiative.'”] Oakland City Council Resolution No. 74678. 1 December 1998. PDF file.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to West Oakland's lack of access to nutritious and healthy food, other organizations including the PCGN and City Slicker Farms demanded the plan include strategies for creating a sustainable impact on the local food system. City Slicker Farms was founded in 2001 in response to the lack of access to fresh produce in West Oakland. Through land donations from local residents, a network of urban farms was created through the Community Market Farms Program, and in 2005 the organization established the Backyard Garden Program to aid West Oakland residents in growing their own food at home.

===Canada===

====Montreal====
[[File:Lufa Farms Aerial view of Montreal rooftop greenhouse3.jpg|thumb|[[Lufa Farms]] greenhouses are constructed on the rooftops of [[Greater Montreal]].]]
Canada has a number of companies working on urban farm technology, including [[Lufa Farms]]. In Montreal, there are 97 community gardens which allow citizens space in each plot to grow their plants. The program has been in place since 1975 and is managed by the boroughs. Of the eighteen boroughs, some have a gardening instructor who visits the gardens regularly to give gardeners tips. The soil, a water supply, a space for tools, sand, fencing, and paint are all provided by the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ville.montreal.qc.ca/portal/page?_pageid=5977,68887600&amp;_dad=portal&amp;_schema=PORTAL|title=Ville de Montreal - Official city portal - Community gardens|work=montreal.qc.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Now you can find about 100 [[community gardens]] in Montreal and they have very extensive, well-established, city run community gardening programs. This gardening program is run by the Department of Sports, Recreation and Social Development which provides the garden with the necessities needed for it to run, such as water, maintenance and others. The largest community garden has about 255 allotment plots while the smallest community garden has about 25 plots. 2/3 of the community gardens can be found in parkland zones, which will help prevent development problems in the long run. Out of 2 million people living in the urbanized parts of Montreal, about 10000 of these residents share the garden plots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Cosgrove |first1=Sean |title=Community Gardening in Major Canadian Cities: Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver Compared |url=http://www.cityfarmer.org/canadaCC.html |publisher=City Farmer, Canada's Office of Urban Agriculture |accessdate=23 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Davidson |first1=Thomas |last2=Krause |first2=Kathryn |title=A Social History of Urban Agriculture in Montreal |url=http://felix.geog.mcgill.ca/other/environ/1999b/food/irp4/history.html#4.0%20Montreal%20Historical%20setting |publisher=McGill |accessdate=23 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 19, 2017, an [[IGA (supermarkets)]] located in Saint-Laurent in Montreal unveiled their largest supermarket [[green roof]] to have opened in Canada. They are currently the only grocery store that sells organic produce on their roof. With about 25000 square feet of green space and products certified by Ecocert Canada, they can sell over 30 different kinds of fresh, organic produce. Along with growing vegetables, they are also selling honey produced and harvested by eight Alvéole bee hives which have also made the green roof their home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=IGA INTRODUCES THE LARGEST ORGANIC SUPERMARKET GREEN ROOF GARDEN IN THE COUNTRY |url=https://www.iga.net/en/press_room/communiques_2017/iga_introduces_the_largest_organic_supermarket_green_roof_garden_in_the_country |website=IGA |publisher=IGA |accessdate=23 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====British Columbia====
A Canadian urban farmer in [[British Columbia]] has published details on a crop value rating (CVR) system that urban farmers can use to determine which [[crop]]s to grow, based on each crop's contribution to supporting the farm economically.&lt;ref name="Stone2016"&gt;{{Citation |last=Stone |first=Curtis A. |year=2016 |title=The Urban Farmer: Growing Food for Profit on Leased and Borrowed Land |publisher=New Society Publishers |url=http://theurbanfarmer.co/ |isbn=978-0865718012 |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This entails forgoing some crops in favor of others, but he points out that urban farmers can develop [[business networking]] with rural farmers to bring some of those other crops to the urban point of sale. For example, the urban farmer may not be able to economically justify growing [[sweet corn]] (based on long [[growing degree-day|days to maturity]] and low [[crop yield|yield]] density per linear foot of row), but a networking arrangement is mutually beneficial, as it lets a rural sweet corn grower gain an additional point of sale at [[retail]] price while also letting the urban farmer fill the gap in his product line offering.&lt;ref name="Stone2016"/&gt;

Several community projects in [[Victoria, British Columbia]] were born to promote urban agricultural practices such as the Sharing Backyards program. This program exists to help people living in urban areas get connected with others who have extra space in their yards for the purpose of urban farming. Organizations also exist to educate people living in the urban parts of Vancouver on farming and growing food in an urban setting by running public demonstration gardens.

Covering the roof of the west building of the [[Vancouver Convention Centre]] is the largest green roof in Canada and one of the 10 largest green roofs in the world. With around six acres of living space, it is home to more than 400,000 indigenous plants and grasses that provide [[Thermal insulation|insulation]]. It is also home to four [[Western honey bee]] beehives which pollinate the plants on the roof and provide honey. The living includes other [[sustainable]] practices such as recycling and reusing water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=ENVIRONMENT FUNCTIONAL, BEAUTIFUL AND ‘GREEN’ |url=https://www.vancouverconventioncentre.com/about-us/environment |website=Vancouver Convention Centre |publisher=Vancouver Convention Centre |accessdate=23 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city of [[Kamloops]], in British Columbia, are actively promoting urban agricultural practices within their community. They stress on the importance of food security and its affect on the economy as well as the ecology. They created the Food and Urban Agriculture Plan (FUAP), initiated in 2014, which lays out goals and strategies to implement a [[sustainable]] food system. The Areas which they cover include: Food Production and Land Availability, Food Processing and Preparing, Food Distribution/Retail/Access, Cooking/Eating and Celebrating Food, Food Waste and Resource Management, as well as Education/Governance and Capacity Building. The FUAP greatly emphasizes on Urban Agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Food and Urban Agriculture Plan Harvesting Our Potential |url=https://www.kamloops.ca/sites/default/files/docs/city-hall/15-09-food_urban_agriculture_plan_2015_285947.pdf |website=Kamloops |publisher=City of Kamloops |accessdate=24 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ontario====
Ontario is the second biggest province and has one of the most urbanized cities in Canada, Toronto. The provincial government of Ontario has a website dedicated to providing information to those who are interested in establishing an urban farm or for those who just want to learn more about urban agriculture in Ontario.

UrbanHensTo is a 3-year pilot program that launched in the City of [[Toronto]] on March 2, 2018. This program allows eligible resident in 4 wards across the city to keep a maximum of 4 hens (no roosters) for the purpose of enjoyment or personal consumption of only the eggs. There are other requirements included with rearing these hens under this program such as [[zoning]] and guidelines for building the enclosure, waste and disposal. The wards eligible for this program from the UrbanHensTo site include:
* Ward 13 (Parkdale-High Park)
* Ward 21 (St. Paul's)
* Ward 5 (Etobicoke-Lakeshore)
* Ward 32 (Beaches-East York)
Workshops are also available to those interested in rearing urban hens. However, failure to abide by these rules and regulations can result in fines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Urban Hens TO Pilot |url=http://tfpc.to/urbanhensto-pilot |website=TFPC |publisher=Toronto Food Policy Council |accessdate=25 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Toronto has a green roof policy and bylaw which has promoted the practice of installing green roofs. According to the Green Roof Industry Survey in 2016, the city was recognized as having the most green roofs installed on buildings in all of North America. This came to be after they developed a green roof strategy in 2009 where new development buildings are required to install a green roof. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Green Roofs |url=https://www.toronto.ca/city-government/planning-development/official-plan-guidelines/green-roofs/ |website=Toronto |publisher=City of Toronto |accessdate=26 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===UK===
[[Todmorden]] is a town of 17,000 inhabitants in [[Yorkshire]], [[United Kingdom]] with a [[Incredible Edible Todmorden project|successful urban agriculture model]]. The project, which began in 2008, has meant that food crops have been planted at forty locations throughout the town.&lt;ref&gt;Paull, John (2013) [http://orgprints.org/24956/28/24956.pdf  "Please Pick Me" – How Incredible Edible Todmorden is repurposing the commons for open source food and agricultural biodiversity],  In J. Franzo, D. Hunter, T. Borelli &amp; F. Mattei (Eds.). Diversifying Foods and Diets: Using Agricultural Biodiversity to Improve Nutrition and Health.

All are "propaganda gardens" promoting locals to consider growing local, to eat seasonal, to consider the provenance of their food, and to enjoy fresh.&lt;ref name="Tod"/&gt; There are food plots in the street, in the health center car park, at the rail station, in the police station, in the cemetery, and in all the town's schools.&lt;ref name="Tod"/&gt;

===Argentina===
The city of [[Rosario]] (population: 1.3 million) has incorporated agriculture fully into its land use planning and urban development strategy. Its Land Use Plan 2007-2017 makes specific provision for the agricultural use of public land. Under its Metropolitan Strategic Plan 2008-2018, Rosario is building a “green circuit”, passing through and around the city, consisting of family and community gardens, large-scale, commercial vegetable gardens and orchards, multifunctional garden parks, and “productive barrios”, where agriculture is integrated into programmes for the construction of public housing and the upgrading of slums. In 2014, the green circuit consisted of more than 30 ha of land used to grow vegetables, fruit and medicinal and aromatic plants. The city has five garden parks – large, landscaped green areas covering a total of 72 ha of land, which are used for agriculture and for cultural, sports and educational activities.&lt;ref&gt;Food and Agriculture Organization (2014) [http://www.fao.org/ag/agp/greenercities/en/GGCLAC/rosario.html Growing greener cities in Latin America and the Caribbean].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Benefits==
The benefits that UPA brings along to cities that implement this practice are numerous. The transformation of cities from only consumers of food to generators of agricultural products contributes to sustainability, improved health, and poverty alleviation.

* UPA assists to close the open loop system in urban areas characterized by the importation of food from rural zones and the exportation of waste to regions outside the city or town.
* Wastewater and organic solid waste can be transformed into resources for growing agriculture products: the former can be used for irrigation, the latter as fertilizer.
* Vacant urban areas can be used for agriculture production.
* Other natural resources can be conserved. The use of wastewater for irrigation improves [[water management]] and increases the availability of freshwater for drinking and household consumption.
* UPA can help to preserve bioregional ecologies from being transformed into cropland.
* Urban agriculture saves energy (e.g. energy consumed in transporting food from rural to urban areas).
* Local production of food also allows savings in transportation costs, storage, and in product loss, what results in food cost reduction.
* UPA improves the quality of the urban environment through greening and thus, a reduction in pollution.
* Urban agriculture also makes the city a healthier place to live by improving the quality of the environment.
* UPA is a very effective tool to fight against hunger and malnutrition since it facilitates the access to food by an impoverished sector of the urban population.
Poverty alleviation: It is known that a large part of the people involved in urban agriculture is the urban poor. In developing countries, the majority of urban agricultural production is for self-consumption, with surpluses being sold in the market. According to the FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations), urban poor consumers spend between 60 and 80 percent of their income on food, making them very vulnerable to higher food prices.
* UPA provides food and creates savings in household expenditure on consumables, thus increasing the amount of income allocated to other uses.
* UPA surpluses can be sold in local markets, generating more income for the urban poor.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

[[Community center]]s and gardens educate the community to see agriculture as an integral part of urban life. The Florida House Institute for Sustainable Development in [[Sarasota, Florida]], serves as a public community and education center in which innovators with sustainable, energy-saving ideas can implement and test them. Community centers like Florida House provide urban areas with a central location to learn about urban agriculture and to begin to integrate agriculture with the urban lifestyle.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Smit, Jack, et al. "Urban Agriculture for Sustainable Cities: Using Wastes and Idle Land and Water Bodies as Resources"&lt;/ref&gt;

Urban farms also are a proven effective educational tool to teach kids about healthy eating and meaningful physical activity.&lt;ref&gt;Can a hands-on teaching tool affect students' attitudes and behavior regarding fruit and vegetables? by Lineberger Sarah E. and J. M. Zajicek, HortTechnology 10 (3) 593-596 -2000&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trade-offs==
* Space is at a premium in cities and is accordingly expensive and difficult to secure.
* The utilization of untreated wastewater for urban agricultural irrigation can facilitate the spread of waterborne diseases among the human population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.agwat.2011.04.005 |title=Urban agriculture, using sustainable practices that involve the reuse of wastewater and solid waste |journal=Agricultural Water Management |volume=98 |issue=9 |pages=1388–94 |year=2011 |last1=Rojas-Valencia |first1=M.N. |last2=Velásquez |first2=M.T. Orta de |last3=Franco |first3=Víctor }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Although studies have demonstrated improved air quality in urban areas related to the proliferation of urban gardens, it has also been shown that increasing urban pollution (related specifically to a sharp rise in the number of automobiles on the road), has led to an increase in insect pests, which consume plants produced by urban agriculture. It is believed that changes to the physical structure of the plants themselves, which have been correlated to increased levels of air pollution, increase plants' palatability to insect pests. Reduced yields within urban gardens decreases the amount of food available for human consumption.&lt;ref name="autogenerated226"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/13504509.2011.570803 |title=The effects of air pollution on urban ecosystems and agriculture |journal=International Journal of Sustainable Development &amp; World Ecology |volume=18 |issue=3 |pages=226–35 |year=2011 |last1=Bell |first1=J. N.B. |last2=Power |first2=S. A. |last3=Jarraud |first3=N. |last4=Agrawal |first4=M. |last5=Davies |first5=C. }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Studies indicate that the nutritional quality of wheat suffers when urban wheat plants are exposed to high nitrogen dioxide and sulfur dioxide concentrations. This problem is particularly acute in the developing world, where outdoor concentrations of sulfur dioxide are high and large percentages of the population rely upon urban agriculture as a primary source of food. These studies have implications for the nutritional quality of other staple crops that are grown in urban settings.&lt;ref name="autogenerated226"/&gt;
* Agricultural activities on land that is contaminated (with such metals as lead) pose potential risks to human health. These risks are associated both with working directly on contaminated land and with consuming food that was grown in contaminated soil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.apgeog.2012.10.001 |title=Assessing soil lead contamination at multiple scales in Oakland, California: Implications for urban agriculture and environmental justice |journal=Applied Geography |volume=35 |pages=460–73 |year=2012 |last1=McClintock |first1=Nathan }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Municipal greening policy goals can pose conflicts. For example, policies promoting urban tree canopy are not sympathetic to vegetable gardening because of the deep shade cast by trees. However, some municipalities like Portland, Oregon, and Davenport, Iowa are encouraging the implementation of fruit-bearing trees (as street trees or as park orchards) to meet both greening and food production goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nordahl|first=Darrin|title=Public Produce: The New Urban Agriculture|year=2009|publisher=Island Press|location=Washington DC|isbn=978-1-59726-588-1}}{{page needed|date=February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1680">A '''vetocracy''' refers to a dysfunctional system of governance whereby no single entity can acquire enough power to make decisions and take effective charge.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/22/opinion/sunday/friedman-down-with-everything.html?_r=0&lt;/ref&gt; The term points to an excessive ability or willingness to use the [[veto]] power within a government or institution (without an adequate means of any override). Such limitations may point to a lack of trust among members or hesitance to cede [[sovereignty]].

Some institutions which have been hampered by perceptions of vetocratic limitations (and even responsible for their downfall) include the [[Articles of Confederation]], the [[Confederate States of America]], and the [[League of Nations]]. The present-day [[United Nations]] Security Council is criticized for its inability to take decisive action due to the [[United Nations Security Council veto power#Veto power reform|exclusive rights of veto power]] of permanent members. [[Thomas Friedman]] and [[Moisés Naím]]&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20140120221736/https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/world/jan-june13/power_04-11.html&lt;/ref&gt; also used the term to describe the argument of [[Frank Fukuyama|Francis Fukuyama]] that the [[United States]] was facing such a crisis.

Vetocracy in social settings is formally equivalent to the principle of [[falsifiability]] in science, whereby a single objecting observation can falsify a proposition. Agreements under vetocracy are achieved, when consensus is reached, and none of the parties within a vetocratic system are left unsatisfied.

'''Water activity''' or a&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[partial pressure|partial]] [[vapor pressure]] of water in a substance divided by the standard state partial [[vapor pressure of water]]. In the field of [[food science]], the standard state is most often defined as the partial vapor pressure of pure water at the same [[temperature]]. Using this particular definition, pure [[distilled water]] has a water activity of exactly one.  As temperature increases, a&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt; typically increases, except in some products with crystalline [[salt]] or [[sugar]].

Higher a&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt; substances tend to support more [[microorganisms]]. [[Bacterium|Bacteria]] usually require at least 0.91, and [[fungi]] at least 0.7.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Rockland |first1=L.B. |last2=Beuchat |first2=L.R. |year=1987 |title=Water Activity:Theory and Applications to Food |edition=2nd |location=New York |publisher=Marcel Dekker }}&lt;/ref&gt; See also [[fermentation]].

Water migrates from areas of high a&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt; to areas of low a&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;. For example, if [[honey]] (a&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt; ≈ 0.6) is exposed to humid [[air]] (a&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt; ≈ 0.7), the honey [[hygroscopy|absorbs water from the air]]. If [[salami]] (a&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt; ≈ 0.87) is exposed to dry air (a&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt; ≈ 0.5), the salami [[desiccation|dries out]], which could [[drying (food)|preserve]] it or [[staling|spoil]] it.

==Formulae==
Definition of a&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt; a_w \equiv p / p* &lt;/math&gt;
where ''p'' is the partial vapor pressure of water in the solution, and ''p*₀'' is the partial vapor pressure of pure water at the same temperature.

Alternate definition:
:&lt;math&gt; a_w \equiv l_w x_w &lt;/math&gt;
where ''l''&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[activity coefficient]] of water and ''x''&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt; is the mole fraction of water in the aqueous fraction.

Relationship to [[relative humidity]]:
The relative humidity of air in equilibrium with a sample is called the Equilibrium Relative Humidity (ERH).&lt;ref name="isbn0-632-05327-5"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Young |first1=Linda |last2=Cauvain |first2=Stanley P. |title=Bakery food manufacture and quality: water control and effects |publisher=Blackwell Science |location=Oxford |year=2000 |pages= |isbn=0-632-05327-5 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \mathrm{ERH} = a_w \times 100\% &lt;/math&gt;

Estimated mold-free shelf life in days at 21° C:
:&lt;math&gt; \mathrm{MFSL} = 10^{7.91 - 8.1 a_w} &lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="isbn0-834-21782-1"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Man |first1=C.M.D. |last2=Jones |first2=Adrian A. |title=Shelf Life Evaluation of Foods |publisher=Springer |location= |year=2000 |pages= |isbn=0-834-21782-1 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
Water activity is an important consideration for food product design and food safety.

===Food product design===
Food designers use water activity to formulate [[shelf-stable food]]. If a product is kept below a certain water activity, then mold growth is inhibited. This results in a longer [[shelf life]].

Water activity values can also help limit [[moisture migration]] within a food product made with different [[ingredient]]s. If raisins of a higher water activity are packaged with bran flakes of a lower water activity, the water from the raisins migrates to the bran flakes over time, making the raisins hard and the bran flakes soggy. Food formulators use water activity to predict how much moisture migration affects their product.

===Food safety===
Water activity is used in many cases as a [[critical control point]] for [[Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points]] (HACCP) programs. Samples of the food product are periodically taken from the production area and tested to ensure water activity values are within a specified range for food quality and safety. Measurements can be made in as little as five minutes, and are made regularly in most major food production facilities.

For many years, researchers tried to equate bacterial growth potential with [[water content]]. They found that the values were not universal, but specific to each food product. W. J. Scott first established that [[bacterial growth]] correlated with water activity, not water content, in 1953. It is firmly established that growth of bacteria is inhibited at specific water activity values. U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) regulations for [[intermediate moisture food]]s are based on these values.

Lowering the water activity of a food product should not be seen as a [[kill step]]. Studies in [[powdered milk]] show that viable cells can exist at much lower water activity values, but that they never grow.{{Cn|date=February 2013}} Over time, bacterial levels decline.

==Measurement==
Water activity values are obtained by either a resistive electrolytic, a [[capacitance]] or a [[dew point]] [[hygrometer]].

===Resistive electrolytic hygrometers===
Resistive electrolytic hygrometers use a sensing element in the form of a liquid electrolyte held in between of two small glass rods by capillary force. The electrolyte changes resistance if it absorbs or loses water vapor. The resistance is directly proportional to relative air humidity, and also to water activity of the sample (once [[vapor–liquid equilibrium]] is established). This relation can be checked by either a [[verification and validation|verification]] or [[calibration]] using salt-water mixtures, which provide a well-defined and reproducible air humidity in the measurement chamber.

The sensor does not have any physically given hysteresis as it is known from capacitance hygrometers and sensors, and does not require regular cleaning as its surface is not the effectively sensing element. Volatiles, in principle, influence the measurement performance—especially those that [[dissociation (chemistry)|dissociate]] in the electrolyte and thereby change its resistance. Such influences can easily be avoided by using chemical protection filters that absorb the volatile compound before arriving at the sensor.

===Capacitance hygrometers===
Capacitance hygrometers consist of two charged plates separated by a [[polymeric membrane|polymer membrane]] [[dielectric]]. As the membrane adsorbs water, its ability to hold a [[electric charge|charge]] increases and the capacitance is measured. This value is roughly proportional to the water activity as determined by a sensor-specific [[calibration]].

Capacitance hygrometers are not affected by most [[volatility (chemistry)|volatile]] chemicals and can be much smaller than other alternative sensors. They do not require cleaning, but are less accurate than dew point hygrometers (+/- 0.015 a&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;). They should have regular calibration checks and can be affected by residual water in the polymer membrane (hysteresis).

===Dew point hygrometers===
[[File:Relative Humidity.png|thumb|400px|right|Red line shows saturation]]
The temperature at which [[dew]] forms on a clean surface is directly related to the [[vapor pressure]] of the air. Dew point hygrometers work by placing a mirror over a closed sample chamber. The mirror is cooled until the dew point temperature is measured by means of an [[optical sensor]]. This temperature is then used to find the [[relative humidity]] of the chamber using [[psychrometrics]] charts.

This method is theoretically the most accurate (+/- 0.003 a&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;) and often the fastest. The sensor requires cleaning if debris accumulates on the mirror.

===Equilibration===
With either method, [[vapor–liquid equilibrium]] must occur in the sample chamber. This takes place over time or can be aided by the addition of a fan in the chamber. [[Thermal equilibrium]] must also take place unless the sample temperature is measured.

==Moisture content==
Water activity is related to [[water content]] in a [[nonlinear system|non-linear relationship]] known as a [[moisture sorption isotherm]] curve. These isotherms are substance- and temperature-specific. Isotherms can be used to help predict product stability over time in different storage conditions.

==Use in humidity control==
There is net evaporation from a solution with a water activity greater than the relative humidity of its surroundings. There is net absorption of water by a solution with a water activity less than the relative humidity of its surroundings. Therefore, in an enclosed space, a solution can be used to regulate humidity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Demchick PH |year=1984 |title=Taking control of chamber humidity |journal=[[The Science Teacher]] |volume=51 |issue=7 |pages=29‑31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''World Anti-Slavery Convention''' met for the first time at [[Exeter Hall]]  in London, on 12–23 June 1840.&lt;ref name="McDaniel"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3UXQs0uO0VMC&amp;pg=PA760 |pages=760–762 |last=McDaniel |first=W.

==Background==
[[File:Exeter Hall.jpg|thumb|Engraving depicting the exterior of [[Exeter Hall]], reproduced on a 1905 [[postcard]].]]

The [[Society for the Abolition of the Slave Trade]] was principally a [[Quaker]] society founded in the eighteenth century by [[Thomas Clarkson]]. The [[slave trade]] had been abolished throughout the [[British Empire]] in 1807. In August 1833 the British government passed the [[Slavery Abolition Act]], advocated by [[William Wilberforce]], which abolished slavery in the British Empire from August 1834, when some 800,000 people in the British empire became free.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oup.com/oxforddnb/info/freeodnb/shelves/slavery/ Slavery and Abolition], [[ODNB]], accessed 10 July 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, in the 1830s many women and men in America acted on their religious convictions and moral outrage to become a part of the [[Abolitionism|abolitionist]] movement. Many women in particular responded to [[William Lloyd Garrison|William Lloyd Garrison's]] invitation to become involved in the [[American Anti-Slavery Society|American Anti-Slavery Society.]] They were heavily involved, attending meetings and writing petitions. [[Arthur Tappan]] and other conservative members of the society objected to women engaging in politics publicly. [http://staging.nyhistory.org/sites/default/files/newfiles/cwh-curriculum/Module%202/Resources/Resource%2015%201840%20Anti-Slavery%20Convention.pdf?_ga=2.227765021.1201267374.1533052978-235152259.1517239637&amp;_gac=1.162386510.1530933395.Cj0KCQjwpvzZBRCbARIsACe8vyI5HP9hp6htrxvXt8dplIe854gqIBwLG15vpEFQSLzT5l_25Q9fAZkaAneXEALw_wcB]

Given the perceived need for a society to campaign for anti-slavery worldwide, the [[British and Foreign Anti-Slavery Society]] (BFASS) was accordingly founded in 1839.&lt;ref name="McDaniel"/&gt; One of its first significant deeds was to organize the World Anti-Slavery Convention in 1840: "Our expectations, we confess, were high, and the reality did not disappoint them."&lt;ref name=dublin&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=kHcAAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=%22George+William+Alexander%22&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;pg=PA213&amp;ci=12,1346,441,100&amp;source=bookclip The Dublin Magazine], 1840 accessed 13 July 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The preparations for this event had begun in 1839, when the Society circulated an advertisement inviting delegates to participate in the convention.&lt;ref name="McDaniel"/&gt; Over 200 of the official delegates were British. The next largest group was the Americans, with around 50 delegates. Only small numbers of delegates from other nations attended.&lt;ref name="McDaniel"/&gt;

The circular message, distributed in 1839 provoked a controversial response from American opponents of slavery. The [[Garrisonian]] faction supported the participation of women in the anti-slavery movement. They were opposed by the supporters of [[Arthur Tappan|Arthur and]]  [[Lewis Tappan]]. When the latter group sent a message to the BFASS opposing the inclusion of women, a second circular was issued in February 1840 which explicitly stated that the meeting was limited to "gentlemen".&lt;ref name="McDaniel"/&gt;

Despite an earlier statement that women would not be admitted, many American and British female abolitionists, including [[Lucretia Mott]], [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]] and [[Lady Byron]], appeared at the World Anti-Slavery Convention in London. [[Wendell Phillips]] proposed that female delegates should be admitted, and much of the first day of the convention was devoted to discussing whether they should be allowed to participate.&lt;ref name="McDaniel"/&gt;Published reports from the convention noted "The upper end and one side of the room were appropriated to ladies, of whom a considerable number were present, including several female abolitionist from the United States." The women were allowed to watch and listen from the spectators gallery but could not take part.

==Proceedings (incomplete)==
{{Slavery}}
The convention's organising committee had asked the Reverend [[Benjamin Godwin]] to prepare a paper on the ethics of slavery.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/Paper-presented-General-Anti-Slavery-Convention/dp/B0008AZ9US/ref=sr_1_24?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1406239300&amp;sr=1-24 Paper presented to the General Anti-Slavery Convention], Rev. Benjamin Godwin, 1840&lt;/ref&gt; The convention unanimously accepted his paper which condemned not just slavery but also the world's religious leaders and every community who had failed to condemn the practise. The convention resolved to write to every religious leader to share this view. The convention called on every religious communities to eject any supporters of slavery from their midst.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=vFIEAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA374&amp;lpg=PA374&amp;dq=reverend+benjamin+godwin+oxford&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=12M6yr6oyq&amp;sig=mU6Au_5DVY9XrndmLlRpJQ3U6g4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=xGTRU4qJI-iq0QX_x4DgBg&amp;ved=0CFMQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=reverend%20benjamin%20godwin%20oxford&amp;f=false The Baptist Magazine], page 374, retrieved 24 July 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

[[George William Alexander]] reported on his visits in 1839, with James Whitehorn, to [[Sweden]] and the [[Netherlands]] to discuss the conditions of slaves in the [[Dutch Empire|Dutch colonies]] and in [[Suriname]]. In Suriname, he reported, there were over 100,000 slaves with an annual attrition rate of twenty per cent. The convention prepared open letters of protest to the respective sovereigns.&lt;ref name=dublin/&gt;

[[Joseph Pease (India reformer)|Joseph Pease]] spoke and accused the British government of being complicit in the continuing existence of slavery in India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Madhavi Kale|title=Fragments of Empire: Capital, Slavery, and Indian Indentured Labor Migration in the British Caribbean|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uCrzkEA1TkkC&amp;pg=PA120|date=1 January 1998|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|isbn=0-8122-3467-7|page=120}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After leaving the convention on the first day, being denied full access to the proceedings, [[Lucretia Mott]] and [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]], " walked home arm in arm, commenting on the incidents of the day, we resolved to hold a convention as soon as we returned home, and form a society to advocate the rights of women." Eight years later they did, hosting the [[Seneca Falls Convention]] in Seneca Falls, New York.
