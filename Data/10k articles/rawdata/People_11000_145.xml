'''Africanization''' or '''Africanisation''' (lit., making something African) has been applied in various contexts, notably in geographic and personal naming and in the composition of the civil service e.g. via processes such as [[indigenization]].&lt;ref&gt;African Successes Four Public Managers of Kenyan Rural Development David K. Leonard UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA PRESS&lt;/ref&gt;

==Africanization of names==

Africanization has referred to the modification of place names and personal names to reflect an "African" identity. In some cases, changes are not a change of transliteration rather than of the European name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Language in Africa: An Introductory Survey|author=Edgar A. Gregersen|year= 1977|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=0-677-04380-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many cases during the colonial period, African place names were [[Anglicisation|Anglicized]] or [[Francization|Francized]].

====Country names====
Various African countries have undergone name changes during the previous century as the result of consolidations and [[secession]]s, territories gaining [[sovereignty]], and [[regime change]]s.

==Africanization of civil services==

In some countries immediately following their independence, "Africanization" was the name given to [[racial]] policies, [[affirmative action]] intended to increase the number of Africans in [[civil service]] (which had historically been dominated by whites&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ffkFRTj1WIwC&amp;pg=PA406&amp;lpg=PA406&amp;dq=Africanization+of+civil+service&amp;source=web&amp;ots=988fWraWRf&amp;sig=gMOO4OWQKqoqnhUwqSOjMnRiK2o&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ct=result Adedeji, Adebayo.

==Localization in African languages==

The term Africanization, abbreviated as the [[numeronym]] "A12n," has been applied to discussion of [[internationalization and localization]] of software and content in [[African languages]].

'''Ashtar''' (sometimes called '''Ashtar Sheran''') is the name given to an [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]] being or group of beings which a number of people claim to have [[Mediumship|channeled]]. [[UFO]] [[contactee]] [[George Van Tassel]] was likely the first to claim to receive an Ashtar message, in 1952.&lt;ref name="Hellandp163"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Flaherty2011p592"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Clarkp26"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Reece2007p137/&gt;  Since then many different claims about Ashtar have appeared in different contexts.  The Ashtar movement is studied by academics as a prominent form of [[UFO religion]].

==Van Tassel==
Denzler observes that "in the long run, probably the most important person for the propagation and perpetuation of the contactee movement was George Van Tassel".&lt;ref name="Denzlerp43"&gt;Denzler, Brenda (2001) p43&lt;/ref&gt; In 1947 Van Tassel moved to [[Giant Rock]], near [[Landers, California|Landers]] in the [[Mojave Desert]], [[California]], where he established a large UFO Center. This became the most successful and well-known UFO meeting center of the time.&lt;ref&gt;Helland, Christopher (2003) p162&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Denzlerpp43-4"&gt;Denzler, Brenda (2001) pp43-4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ellwoodp395"&gt;Ellwood, Robert S. (1995) p395&lt;/ref&gt;

As one of the founding "fathers" of the modern religious [[ufology|ufologies]],&lt;ref&gt;Grunschloss, Andreas (2004) p422&lt;/ref&gt; Van Tassel also created arguably the most prominent UFO group established in the US in the late 1940s and early 1950s, although not as influential or well-known today. This was the "Ministry of Universal Wisdom" begun in 1953, which evolved out of two previous groups he had organized at Giant Rock in the late 1940s. The organization investigated and encouraged the healing arts, but its prime focus was to collect and analyse UFO phenomena and interview 'contactees'. Due to radio and television interest, Van Tassel became the most well-known promoter of contactee experiences and somewhat of a celebrity in the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;Helland, Christopher (2003) pp162-3&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1952 Van Tassel himself claimed to receive messages via telepathic communication from an extraterrestrial and [[interdimensional being]] named "Ashtar".&lt;ref name="Hellandp163"&gt;Helland, Christopher (2003) p163&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Flaherty2011p592"&gt;Flaherty, Robert Pearson (2011) p592&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Clarkp26"&gt;Clark, Jerome (2007) p26&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Denzlerp43" /&gt; This source became the "first metaphysical superstar of the flying saucer age".&lt;ref name="Clarkp26" /&gt; Van Tassel also interpreted the Christian [[Bible]] in terms of extraterrestrial intervention in the evolution of the human race, and claimed that [[Jesus]] was a being from space. The Ministry of Universal Wisdom taught that all humans have the power to tap into the "Universal Mind of God", which facilitates evolutionary progress such as that exemplified by Jesus and Ashtar. Van Tassel also claimed that by accessing the Universal Mind he could receive messages not only from Ashtar but from humans who had died, such as [[Nikola Tesla]]. From Tesla he claimed to receive instructions to build the "[[Integratron]]" machine, which could extend lifespan and access knowledge from the past and future.&lt;ref&gt;Helland, Christopher (2003) pp 167-8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reece, Gregory L (2007) p132&lt;/ref&gt;

Although his purported method of communication with extraterrestrial intelligences resembled what is commonly referred to as "channeling", Van Tassel claimed to have established a new form of [[Telepathy|telepathic]] communication with these 'sources', utilizing a method which included both natural human abilities and the use of an allegedly advanced form of alien technology, rather than the more traditionally [[religion|religious]], non-technological, [[spiritual medium]] based approach taken by many other early channelers of the era. Van Tassel maintained that the method he utilized was not a [[paranormal]] or [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] activity, but required being 'in resonance' with the messages being sent.  It was an example of the application of an allegedly advanced extraterrestrial science, that anyone could implement with the proper training in meditation techniques.&lt;ref name="Hellandp163"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Flaherty2011p592"/&gt;

==Giant Rock Space Conventions==
Van Tassel held weekly channeling sessions at Giant Rock at which people could "ask questions" and "channel answers" from extraterrestrials.&lt;ref name="Hellandp163" /&gt; According to Jerome Clark, these gatherings coalesced the scattered contactee subculture into a recognisable movement in January 1952.&lt;ref name="Clarkp26" /&gt; This led to the annual [[UFO convention|Giant Rock Spacecraft Convention]]  organized by Van Tassel, which began in the spring of 1953 and continued for at least another 24 years. It marked Van Tassel’s most important role in UFO history&lt;ref name="Hellandp163" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Denzlerpp43-4" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ellwoodp395" /&gt; In 1959 up to 11,000 people attended these conventions and heard channeled messages claiming to come from space.&lt;ref name="Ellwoodp395" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Helland2000p38"&gt;Helland, Christopher (2000) p38&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the well-known UFO contactees attended these conventions as speakers and channelers.&lt;ref name="Hellandp163-4"&gt;Helland, Christopher (2003) pp 163-4&lt;/ref&gt; Melton states that almost all of the 1950s contactees became involved in the two ecumenical structures founded by either Van Tassel or Gabriel Green.&lt;ref name="Melton2002p798"&gt;Melton, J. Gordon (2002) p798&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the early messages Van Tassel claimed to have received from Ashtar were first presented to the public at these events.&lt;ref name="Hellandp163-4" /&gt;

Van Tassel's early purported messages from Ashtar contained a great deal of [[apocalypticism|apocalyptic]] material, which focused on concerns regarding the development of the soon to be tested [[hydrogen bomb]].&lt;ref name="Grunschloss2004p422-3"&gt;Grunschloss, Andreas (2004) p422-3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Helland2003p164"&gt;Helland, Christopher (2003) p164&lt;/ref&gt; It was claimed that on July 18, 1952, Ashtar entered the solar system as Commander in Chief of the Ashtar Galactic Command to warn humanity of the dangers of detonating the H-bomb, including the destruction of the planet.&lt;ref name="Helland2000p38" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Helland2003p164" /&gt;&lt;ref name="HellandLewis2003p498"&gt;Helland, Christopher (Lewis, 2003) p498&lt;/ref&gt; The messages stated the space command was determined that humans would not destroy the Earth through the wrong use of nuclear power and that the Command was helping the human race.&lt;ref name="Grunschloss2004p422-3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Helland, Christopher (2003) pp164-5&lt;/ref&gt; Van Tassel also claimed that Ashtar had provided specific messages that he was expected to pass on to the [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. federal government]] regarding the potential negative impacts of the proposed upcoming bomb tests.&lt;ref name="Helland2003p164" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Reece2007p136"&gt;Reece, Gregory L. (2007) p136&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Grunschloss2004p423"&gt;Grunschloss, Andreas (2004) p423&lt;/ref&gt; After the actual explosion of the H-bomb by the US and Russian governments, the channeling claimed that the space forces had assisted the planet to survive the bomb tests.&lt;ref&gt;Helland, Christopher (2003) pp165-6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reece, Gregory L. (2007) pp136-7&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ashtar Command==
{{for|the Indie music band|Ashtar Command (band)}}
As the weekly channeling sessions at Giant Rock continued through the early 1950s, the concept of an "Ashtar Command" was appropriated for use by a number of prominent early contactees and channelers, based on the figure of Ashtar, originally promoted by Van Tassel.&lt;ref&gt;Helland, Christopher (2003) pp168-9&lt;/ref&gt;  Robert Short (AKA Bill Rose), editor of the 1950s UFO magazine "Interplanetary News Digest", was a member of Van Tassel’s group.  He began to popularise the messages, but as Van Tassel did not agree that other Ashtar messages were authentic, Short broke away and began his own group called "Ashtar Command".&lt;ref name=Flaherty2011p592/&gt;&lt;ref name=HellandLewis2003p498/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Helland, Christopher (2003) p169&lt;/ref&gt;

By the mid-1950s, the concept of Ashtar and a galactic law enforcement agency preparing an imminent rescue of humanity had become well-established, and included various well-known, esoteric channelers of the era.  For instance, Elouise Moeller predicted that a space fleet would arrive in the near future; and Adelaide J Brown claimed that flourishing civilisations existed on the other planets in the solar system.&lt;ref&gt;Helland, Christopher (2003) pp169-170&lt;/ref&gt;

However, as time and scientific knowledge progressed, the public failure of these predictions had an enormous negative impact on the expansion of the Ashtar Command movement due to the lack of a central authority that could undertake damage control.  Although Robert Short had spent a lot of time promoting the Ashtar message, he was neither the leader nor the only interpreter, as by this time dozens of Ashtar channelers were presenting conflicting messages.&lt;ref name=Helland2003p170&gt;Helland, Christopher (2003) p170&lt;/ref&gt;

==Derivation of the Ashtar movement==
With the advent of UFO religions, "Ascended Masters" from the esoteric teachings have been described as reappearing in space suits. The space concept was not entirely new however, as the more arcane teachings of Theosophy contained references to extraterrestrial masters.&lt;ref name=Grunschloss2004p422-3/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Partridge, Christopher (2003) pp10,12,19&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, James R. (2003) pp96,126-7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Denzler2001p46&gt;Denzler, Brenda (2001) p46&lt;/ref&gt;  The concept of the Ascended Master is particularly clear in the Ashtar teachings.&lt;ref&gt;Partridge, Christopher (2003) p19&lt;/ref&gt; The very word "ashtar" appears in Helena Blavatsky’s ''The Secret Doctrine'' (1888).&lt;ref&gt;Grunschloss, Andreas (Partridge 2004) p373&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Helland, the initial account of the Ashtar message as channeled through Van Tassel was not a spiritual message as such but "an early contact account between extraterrestrials and humankind." It focused on intervention in human scientific development, and came from a real technological space being on an urgent interstellar undertaking. However, throughout the 1950s and 1960s, as many individuals in the spiritualist movement began to claim contact with Ashtar, the space being began to play more of an Ascended Master role in the narratives.&lt;ref name=HellandLewis2003p498/&gt;

==Ashtar movement==
The Ashtar Command evolved into a movement that had no central authority for several decades up until the mid 1990s, and has been described by Flaherty as "the common property of a diffuse New Age Spiritualist milieu."  During this time the teachings claiming to be channeled from Ashtar varied immensely.&lt;ref name=Flaherty2011p592/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Helland, Christopher (Lewis, 2003) p497&lt;/ref&gt;  Part of this movement metamorphosed into Guardian Action International and then Guardian Activation International.&lt;ref name=Tumminia2007p309&gt;Tumminia, Diana (2007) p309&lt;/ref&gt;  Guardian Action Publications was founded to disseminate the channeling, and published several books through the 1980s.  In 1988, a newsletter "Ashtar’s Golden Circle" was also issued.&lt;ref name=Melton2002p798/&gt;

Grunschloss, who refers to the Ashtar Command as a worldwide network of several loosely organised groups, describes much of the Ashtar channeling as akin to [[cargo cult]]s, due to the blending of spiritual ascension with new alien technologies and ecologically harmless energies.  Grunschloss maintains that most of the Ashtar millenarian concepts involve a transformation of human beings, via these technologies, who will then return to the planet Earth to enjoy a golden millennium.&lt;ref&gt;Grunschloss, Andreas (2004) p424-6&lt;/ref&gt;  Later, with the failure of these prophecies, teachings were modified to include a less material and more spiritual emphasis.&lt;ref&gt;Helland, Christopher (2003) pp172-7&lt;/ref&gt;

===Broadcasts===
In 1971, a British radio talk show devoted to UFOs received a strange call-in claiming to originate from outer space, which some of the guests believed to be genuine.&lt;ref&gt;

==Yvonne Cole==
Yvonne Cole, who claimed to be channeling Ashtar messages from 1986, predicted the destruction of all Earth civilizations and the arrival on the planet of various alien cultures in 1994.&lt;ref name=Helland2003p173&gt;Helland, Christopher (2003) p173&lt;/ref&gt; Cole claimed that governments were working with extraterrestrials to prepare for contact.&lt;ref&gt;Yvonne Cole in ''Connecting Link Magazine'', volume 23,1994, as referenced in [http://www.eternal-productions.org/PDFS/articles/Rapture%20-%20A%20Counterfeit%20Explanation.pdf "The Rapture: A Counterfeit Explanation"] from Mussler, Chuck (1997), Koinonia House, Chapter 9&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Cole, the landing would be broadcast through the global media and include a message from the Ashtar Command.  Due to 'sensitization', most of humanity would accept the UFOs as part of humanity’s continuing evolution, while Ashtar followers would be needed as advisors, ambassadors and peacekeepers between the alien races and humankind.  This would lead to a radical transformation of the world as humanity was initiated into a higher level of existence.  These prophecies furthered the continued fracturing and disappointment within the movement when they failed to occur.&lt;ref name=Helland2000p38/&gt;&lt;ref name=Helland2003p173/&gt;  Despite these failures, during the 1980s a number of individuals began to claim contact with the Ashtar Command through channeling, and various small groups were formed to receive and disseminate the messages.&lt;ref name=Helland2003p499&gt;Helland, Christopher (Lewis 2003) p499&lt;/ref&gt;

==Developments after the mid-1990s==
By the mid-1990s (and continuing up to the present) several of these channeling groups began to utilize the Internet in order to promulgate their beliefs and to attempt to unify the movement by establishing a single 'authoritative' source for all Ashtar messages.  This led to more prominence in the religious scene and significant membership.&lt;ref name=Denzler2001p46/&gt;&lt;ref name=Helland2003p173/&gt;&lt;ref name=Helland2003p499/&gt;

This cohesive response addressed the problem of conflicting, negative and failed prophecies which, after some effort, enabled the Ashtar Command to produce a single Ashtar world view.&lt;ref name=Helland2003p173/&gt;   Individual channelers espousing messages which differed and continued to focus on themes such as the destruction of Earth, conspiracies, ET mass evacuations and general fear-mongering were declared invalid. It was claimed that these channelers had been deceived by negative space beings who had rebelled from the Ashtar Command, made alliances with similar others, and begun operating on the 'lower planes closest to Earth’.&lt;ref&gt;Helland, Christopher (2003) Pp173-4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Partridge, Christopher (2005) pp265-6&lt;/ref&gt;

Most significantly of all, the new, more unified movement declared that in future no new channels would be accepted unless they operated on the ‘level of the soul’. As Helland points out, this was crucial to the formation of an orthodoxy.   Channeled messages from Ashtar would be accepted as valid by the new orthodoxy if they complied with criteria consisting of a set of twelve guidelines which outlined what the movement stood for and how Ashtar would interact with society.  This had never been attempted before in the 45 years of channeling Ashtar, who was also presented as a Divine figure similar to Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;Helland, Christopher, (2003) p174&lt;/ref&gt;

The new framework claimed that the millions of spaceships believed to be constantly in the vicinity of Earth would never interfere on the planet’s surface unless there was a serious problem such as a third world war or an ‘astrophysical catastrophe’.  Helland observes that the emergent group was “noticeably more spiritually focussed and less concerned with extraterrestrial spaceships and visitors.”&lt;ref name=Helland2003p175&gt;Helland, Christopher (2003) p175&lt;/ref&gt;

He states that very little distinguished the new Ashtar Command from other theosophically-influenced groups, except that in 1994 a distinctive component, the Pioneer Voyage, was incorporated into the Ashtar world view&lt;ref name=Helland2003p175/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Partridge, Christopher (2003) p20&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Pioneer Voyage==
In 1994, a small group of Ashtar Command members claimed that an extraordinary event had taken place: "the lift-off experience”. They communicated via the Ashtar Network that they had been placed aboard the ‘ships of Light’ that were circling the planet.  “The Galactic Fifth Fleet” had used ‘physical vibrational transfer’ which involved the human consciousness (or, sometimes, the ‘etheric body’) being raised from the physical dimension and transferred to the “Light ships”.&lt;ref&gt;Helland, Christopher (2003) pp175-6&lt;/ref&gt;

A second event was predicted for December 1994 in which over 250 people participated and which was declared by the leadership to have “opened a portal to the AC (Ashtar Command) ships for ever.”  It was claimed that in order to participate, a person’s vibrations were raised through an eight step contemplative procedure; and that the Pioneer Voyage would occur during the period of a devotee’s meditative state and would later be revealed to the individual in some form of conscious recall.  This eventually evoked ‘memory recall’ from a core group of Ashtar Command members meeting in Australia who began providing accounts of their 'time aboard the ships'.  Others followed suit.  The time on the ships was claimed to be extensive even though the member’s meditation period was short.&lt;ref&gt;Helland, Christopher, (2003) p176&lt;/ref&gt;

Helland notes that, despite an increase in complexity, the general themes have remained in accordance with the Australian reports. The claim is that the events are occurring on a spiritual or etheric dimension and not a physical one.&lt;ref&gt;Helland, Christopher (2003) p177&lt;/ref&gt;  The group claims that the purpose of the Lift-off is for the ascension of the human race as a whole, to which individual ascension is a precursor and an aid. It also claims that the collective ascension is being aided by large electronic grids deployed around the planet by the guardian ships.&lt;ref name=Helland2000p40&gt;Helland, Christopher (2000) p40&lt;/ref&gt;

==Credibility==
Helland points out the failure of the July 1952 prediction channeled through Van Tassel that life on Earth will be destroyed “when they explode the hydrogen atom” because in November 1952 the first H-bomb was detonated with no such effect.&lt;ref&gt;Helland, Christopher (2003) pp164-6&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the same message also stated that Ashtar was intervening to stop the destruction of the planet.&lt;ref name=Reece2007p136/&gt;&lt;ref name=Grunschloss2004p423/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Helland, Christopher (Lewis 2003) p500&lt;/ref&gt;  After the explosion, ensuing messages claimed that various actions were taken by the space fleet to repair damage.&lt;ref name=Reece2007p137&gt;Reece, Gregory L. (2007) p137&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Helland, Christopher (2003) p166&lt;/ref&gt;

After the introduction of Ashtar by Van Tassel, other mediums began to claim contact.  The most widely publicised of these messages were met with failure when they predicted civilisations flourishing on the other planets and an imminent landing of space ships on Earth.&lt;ref&gt;Helland, Christopher (2003) pp168-173&lt;/ref&gt;  At one point, according to Helland, dozens of people were claiming contact with Ashtar and presenting conflicting messages.&lt;ref name=Helland2003p170/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reece,Gregory L.(2007 p138&lt;/ref&gt;

Helland notes that the Ashtar belief system is based on faith in an extraterrestrial celebrity, the concept of which has fared better than the individual messages.  The main shifts in content seem due to failed prophecy, which has moved the emphasis from a physical space fleet averting doom, to the more theosophical concept of an Ascended Master aiding spiritual advancement.&lt;ref&gt;Helland, Christopher (2003) p175,p177&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grunschloss, Andreas 2004 p427&lt;/ref&gt;  He maintains that the Ashtar beliefs are best seen as a syncretism between the I AM movements and the UFO experience,&lt;ref name=Tumminia2007p309/&gt;&lt;ref name=Helland2000p40/&gt; a belief system which regards UFO experiences and sightings as the natural progression of the spiritual development of humanity.&lt;ref name=Helland2000p40/&gt;

'''Charles Darwin's education''' gave him a foundation in the [[history of creationism|doctrine of Creation]] prevalent throughout the West at the time, as well as knowledge of medicine and theology. More significantly, it led to his interest in [[natural history]], which culminated in his taking part in [[Second voyage of HMS Beagle|the second voyage of the ''Beagle'']] and the eventual [[inception of Darwin's theory|inception of his theory]] of [[natural selection]]. Although [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]] changed his field of interest several times in these formative years, many of his later discoveries and beliefs were foreshadowed by the influences he had as a youth.

==Background and influences==
[[File:Darwin cutout.png|thumb|[[Erasmus Darwin]], Charles Darwin's paternal grandfather, helped influence Darwin's later [[Charles Darwin's views on religion|religious views]].]]

Born in 1809, [[Charles Darwin]] grew up in a conservative era when repression of revolutionary [[Radicalism (historical)|Radicalism]] had displaced the 18th century [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]. The [[Church of England]] dominated the English scientific establishment. The Church saw natural history as revealing God's underlying plan and as supporting the existing social hierarchy. It rejected Enlightenment philosophers such as [[David Hume]] who had argued for [[naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]] and against [[theism|belief in God]].

The discovery of [[fossil]]s of [[extinction|extinct]] species was explained by theories such as [[catastrophism]]. Catastrophism claimed that animals and plants were periodically annihilated as a result of natural catastrophes and then replaced by new species created ''[[ex nihilo]]'' (out of nothing). The extinct organisms could then be observed in the fossil record, and their replacements were considered to be immutable.

Darwin's [[Darwin — Wedgwood family|extended family of Darwins and Wedgwoods]] was strongly [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]]. One of his grandfathers, [[Erasmus Darwin]], was a successful physician, and was followed in this by his sons [[Charles Darwin (1758–1778)|Charles Darwin]], who died while still a promising medical student at the [[University of Edinburgh]] in 1778, and Doctor [[Robert Darwin]], Darwin's father, who named his son after his deceased brother.

Erasmus was a [[freethought|freethinker]] who hypothesized that all warm-blooded animals sprang from a single living "filament" long, long ago. He further proposed evolution by acquired characteristics, anticipating the theory later developed by [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]].  Although Charles was born after his grandfather Erasmus died, his father Robert found the texts an invaluable medical guide and Charles read them as a student. Doctor Robert also followed Erasmus in being a freethinker, but as a wealthy society physician was more discreet and attended the [[Church of England]] patronised by his clients.

==Childhood==
[[File:Charles Darwin 1816.jpg|thumb|190px|left|The seven-year-old Charles Darwin in 1816, a year before the sudden loss of his mother.]]
Charles Robert Darwin was born in [[Shrewsbury]], Shropshire, England on 12 February 1809 at his family home, [[The Mount, Shrewsbury|the Mount]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://darwin.baruch.cuny.edu/biography/shrewsbury/mount/|title=The Mount House, Shrewsbury, England (Charles Darwin)|author=John H. Wahlert|date=11 June 2001|work=Darwin and Darwinism|publisher=[[Baruch College]]|accessdate=26 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the fifth of six children of wealthy society doctor and financier [[Robert Darwin]], and [[Susannah Darwin]] (''née'' Wedgwood). Both families were largely [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]], though the Wedgwoods were adopting [[Anglicanism]]. Robert Darwin, himself quietly a [[Freethought#England and France|freethinker]], had baby Charles [[baptism|baptised]] on 15 November 1809 in the Anglican [[St Chad's Church, Shrewsbury]], but Charles and his siblings attended the Unitarian chapel with their mother.&lt;ref name=skool&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp= 12–15}}&lt;br /&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1958|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1497&amp;pageseq=21 21–25]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;From [http://darwin-online.org.uk/life1b.html Charles Darwin: a life in pictures] at Darwin Online, the parish register of St. Chad's gives Darwin's date of baptism as 15 November 1809, a date supported by "England, Births and Christenings, 1538–1975," index, FamilySearch, accessed 18 July 2012), [https://familysearch.org/pal:/MM9.1.1/J362-MP8 Charles Robt. Darwin], 1809. The date is given as 17 November in Freeman (2007) [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=A27b&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=113 p. 106], and Desmond &amp; Moore p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a young child at The Mount, Darwin avidly collected [[animal shell]]s, [[Philately|postal frank]]s, [[Egg (biology)|bird's egg]]s, pebbles and minerals. He was very fond of gardening, an interest his father shared and encouraged, and would follow the family gardener around. Early in 1817, soon after becoming eight years old, he started at the small local school run by a Unitarian minister, the Reverend George Case. At home, Charles learned to ride ponies, shoot and fish. Influenced by his father's fashionable interest in [[natural history]], he tried to make out the names of plants, and was given by his father two elementary natural history books.  Childhood games included inventing and writing out complex secret codes. Charles would tell elaborate stories to his family and friends "for the pure pleasure of attracting attention &amp; surprise", including hoaxes such as pretending to find apples he'd hidden earlier, and what he later called the "monstrous fable" which persuaded his schoolfriend that the colour of [[primula]] flowers could be changed by dosing them with special water. However, his father benignly ignored these passing games, and Charles later recounted that he stopped them because no-one paid any attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Browne|1995|pp=10–16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1958|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1497&amp;pageseq=22 22–24].}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1817 his mother died after the sudden onset of violent stomach pains and amidst the grief his older sisters had to take charge, with their father continuing to dominate the household whenever he returned from his doctor's rounds. To the {{frac|8|1|2}}-year-old Charles this situation was not a great change, as his mother had frequently been ill and her available time taken up by social duties, so his upbringing had largely been in the hands of his three older sisters who were nearly adults by then. In later years he had difficulty in remembering his mother, and his only memory of her death and funeral was of the children being sent for and going into her room, and his "Father meeting us crying afterwards".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Browne|1995|pp=18–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As had been planned previously, in September 1818 Charles joined his older brother [[Erasmus Alvey Darwin]] (nicknamed "Eras") in staying as a boarder at the [[Shrewsbury School]], where he loathed the required [[rote learning]], and would try to visit home when he could. He continued collecting minerals and insects, and family holidays in [[Wales]] brought Charles new opportunities, but an older sister ruled that "it was not right to kill insects" for his collections, and he had to find dead ones. He read [[Gilbert White]]'s ''The Natural History and Antiquities of Selborne'' and took up [[birdwatching]]. Eras took an interest in [[chemistry]] and Charles became his assistant, with the two using a garden shed at their home fitted out as a laboratory and extending their interests to [[crystallography]]. When Eras went on to a medical course at the [[University of Cambridge]], Charles continued to rush home to the shed on weekends, and for this received the nickname "Gas". The headmaster was not amused at this diversion from studying the classics, calling him a ''poco curante'' (trifler) in front of the boys. At fifteen, his interest shifted to hunting and bird-shooting at local estates, particularly at [[Maer, Staffordshire|Maer]] in Staffordshire, the home of his relatives, the [[Wedgwood]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Browne|1995|pp=23–34}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1958|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1497&amp;pageseq=46 44–46].}}&lt;/ref&gt; His exasperated father once told him off, saying "You care for nothing but shooting, dogs, and rat-catching, and you will be a disgrace to yourself and all your family."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1958|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1497&amp;pageseq=28 28].}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His father decided that he should leave school earlier than usual, and in 1825 at the age of sixteen Charles was to go along with his brother who was to attend the [[University of Edinburgh]] for a year to obtain medical qualifications.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Browne|1995|pp=34–35}}&lt;/ref&gt; Charles spent the summer as an apprentice doctor, helping his father with treating the poor of [[Shropshire]]. He had half a dozen patients of his own, and would note their symptoms for his father to make up the prescriptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1958|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1497&amp;pageseq=48 46–47].}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==University of Edinburgh==
[[File:Edinburgh University 1827.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Darwin attended the [[University of Edinburgh]] to study medicine, at a time when the new buildings it occupied (the [[Old College, University of Edinburgh|Old College]]) were still under construction.  South College Street, to the left of the picture, connects to Lothian Street.]]
[[File:Charles Darwin plaque, Lothian Street, Edinburgh.JPG|thumb|140px|Plaque in Lothian Street, indicating where Darwin lived while studying at Edinburgh]]
Darwin went to [[University of Edinburgh|Edinburgh University]] in October 1825 to study medicine, accompanied by Eras doing his external hospital study. The brothers took lodgings at 11 Lothian Street, near the University.&lt;ref name=rough&gt;{{cite web |url=http://roughguidetoevolution.blogspot.com/2008/09/evolutionary-tourist-in-edinburgh.html |title=The Rough Guide to Evolution: The evolutionary tourist in Edinburgh |author= Mark Pallen. |date= 27 September 2008 |accessdate=17 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="letter 16"&gt;{{Cite web  | title = Darwin Correspondence Project – Letter 16 – Darwin, C. R. to Darwin, R. W., (23 Oct 1825) | url = http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/entry-16 | accessdate = 24 February 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The city was in an uproar over political and religious controversies, and the competitive system where professors were dependent on attracting student fees for income meant that the university was riven with argumentative feuds and conflicts. The monopoly held by established medical professors was challenged by private independent schools, with new ideas of teaching by dissecting corpses giving clandestine trade to [[Body-snatching|bodysnatchers]] (just shortly before the [[Burke and Hare]] scandal).&lt;ref name=B45-62/&gt;

He attended the official university lectures, but complained that most were stupid and boring, and found himself too sensitive to the sight of blood. He was disgusted by the dull and outdated anatomy lectures of professor [[Alexander Monro (tertius)|Alexander Monro ''tertius'']], and later regretted his failure to persevere and learn dissection. Munro's lectures included vehement opposition to [[George Combe]]'s daringly [[materialism|materialist]] ideas of [[phrenology]]. As the exception to the general dullness, the spectacular chemistry lectures of [[Thomas Charles Hope]] were greatly enjoyed by the brothers, but they did not join a student society giving hands-on experience. Darwin regularly attended clinical wards in the hospital despite his great distress about some of the cases, but could only bear to attend surgical operations twice, rushing away before they were completed due to his distress at the brutality of surgery before [[anaesthetic]]s. He was long haunted by the memory, particularly of an operation on a child.&lt;ref name=B45-62&gt;{{harvnb|Browne|1995|pp=45–62}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=auto46&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1958|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1497&amp;pageseq=48 46–48].}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The brothers kept each other company, and made extensive use of the library. Darwin's reading included novels and [[James Boswell|Boswell]]'s ''[[Life of Samuel Johnson|Life of Johnson]]''. He had brought [[natural history]] books with him, including a copy of ''A Naturalist's Companion'' by [[George Graves (biologist)|George Graves]], bought in August in anticipation of seeing the seaside, and he borrowed similar books from the library. The brothers went for regular Sunday walks on the shores of the [[Firth of Forth]] and Darwin kept a diary recording their finds, which included a [[sea mouse]] and a [[cuttlefish]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Browne|1995|pp=46, 49, 65–67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Darwin wrote home that "I am going to learn to stuff birds, from a [[Wiktionary:blackamoor|blackamoor]]... he only charges one guinea, for an hour every day for two months". These lessons in [[taxidermy]] were with the freed black slave [[John Edmonstone]], who also lived in Lothian Street. Darwin often sat with him to hear tales of the South American rain-forest of [[Guyana]], and later remembered him as "a very pleasant and intelligent man."&lt;ref name=rough /&gt;&lt;ref name="B45-62"/&gt;&lt;ref name=auto51&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1958|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1497&amp;pageseq=53 51].}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his summer holiday Charles read ''[[Zoönomia]]'' by his grandfather [[Erasmus Darwin]], which his father valued for medical guidance but which also proposed evolution by acquired characteristics. In June he went on a walking tour in North Wales.

===Lamarckian anatomy===
In his second year Charles became active in student societies for naturalists. The 21-year-old radical demagogue [[William A. F. Browne]] and the 19-year-old [[John Coldstream]] both proposed Darwin for membership of the [[Plinian Society]] on 21 November 1826.  John Coldstream came from an evangelical background and shared Darwin's fascination with sea life.  Darwin was elected to its Council on 5 December, and at the same meeting Browne presented an attack on [[Charles Bell]]'s ''Anatomy and Physiology of Expression'' (which in 1872 Darwin would target in ''[[The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals]]'').

Darwin became a keen student of [[Robert Edmond Grant]], a [[Lamarckism|Lamarckian]] anatomist. Grant had cited [[Erasmus Darwin]] in his doctoral thesis and shared the [[evolutionism|evolutionist]] ideas of [[Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire]] on evolution by acquired characteristics. Charles joined Grant in pioneering investigations of the life cycle of [[marine invertebrate]]s on the shores of the [[Firth of Forth]].  Darwin and Grant collected tiny animals from the rock pools and walked along the rocky shore at [[Prestonpans]], where Grant lived during the winter at [[Walford House]]. Grant began taking Darwin as a guest to professor [[Robert Jameson]]'s [[Wernerian Natural History Society]]. There Charles saw [[John James Audubon]] lecturing on the habits of North American birds.&lt;ref name=rough /&gt;&lt;ref name=auto51/&gt; In the April–October 1826 edition of the quarterly ''[[Edinburgh New Philosophical Journal]]'' edited by Jameson, an anonymous paper praised "Mr. Lamarck, one of the most sagacious naturalists of our day" for having "expressed himself in the most unambiguous manner. He admits, on the one hand, the existence of the simplest infusory animals; on the other, the existence of the simplest worms, by means of spontaneous generation, that is, by an aggregation process of animal elements; and maintains, that all other animals, by the operation of external circumstances, are evolved from these in a double series, and in a gradual manner."&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Jameson|Jameson, Robert]] ed. (1826) ''[[Edinburgh New Philosophical Journal]]'', A. and C. Black, Edinburgh, pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=zkoEAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA297&amp;dq=jameson+evolved+%22simplest+worms%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=H7QMTaqEJsubhQf55dy4Dg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 296–297]&lt;/ref&gt; – this was the first use of the word "evolved" in a modern sense. Though some have attributed authorship to Jameson,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|p=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; this is hotly contested and others see Grant as having written it, as the first significant statement to relate Lamarck's concepts to the geological record of living organisms of the past.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Browne|1995|p=81}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Darwin made a discovery new to science when he observed [[cilia]] moving the microscopic larvae of a species of the [[bryozoa]]n ''[[Flustra]]''. He rushed to tell Grant, confirming Grant's belief that the larvae of these marine animals were free swimming, but was upset when Grant claimed rights to the work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=CUL-DAR262.23.3&amp;pageseq=1 |title=On plagiarism and scientific jealousy  |accessdate=4 March 2008 |author=Litchfield, Henrietta. nd. |authorlink= Henrietta Litchfield |year=1871 |format= |work= |publisher= |pages= |language= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060925080113/http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=CUL-DAR262.23.3&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=1|archivedate=2006-09-25|dead-url=yes |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Darwin also made the discovery that black spores often found in [[oyster]] shells were the eggs of a skate [[leech]], and was disappointed when Grant announced both finds to the ''Wernerian'' on 24 March 1827 without giving Darwin credit,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Browne|1995|p=86}}&lt;/ref&gt; though Grant in his publication about the leech eggs in the ''Edinburgh Journal of Science'' later that year acknowledged "The merit of having first ascertained them to belong to that animal is due to my zealous young friend Mr Charles Darwin of Shrewsbury", the first time Darwin's name appeared in print.&lt;ref name=leech&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=A144&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=1 |title=Notice regarding the ova of the Pontobdella muricata, Lam. |accessdate=3 March 2008 |author= Grant, R.

H. ed. |year=1977 |work=The collected papers of Charles Darwin |publisher=Chicago: University Press |pages=vol. 2: 285–91 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the meeting Browne argued that mind and consciousness were simply aspects of brain activity, not "souls" or spiritual entities separate from the body. A furious debate ensued, and later someone deleted all mention of this [[materialism|materialist]] heresy from the minutes. This was Darwin's first exposure to militant freethought and the storm it stirred up.

During their walks Grant expounded his ideas to Darwin, and on one occasion dropped his guard and praised Lamarck's views on evolution. He explained his radical theory of ''[[homology (biology)|homology]]'', an extension of the idea of ''unity of plan'' in vogue in Paris at the time. He argued that all animals had similar organs differing only in complexity and, controversially, that this showed their [[common descent]]. Grant had announced to the ''Wernerian'' his identification of the pancreas in a pinned-out sea-slug, showing an organ molluscs shared with mammals. He assumed that as the earth cooled, changing conditions drove life towards higher, hotter blooded forms, as shown by a progressive sequence of fossils, and that study of eggs of the simplest creatures would help reveal ''[[Unicellular organism|monad]]s'', elementary living particles. While this showed that naturalists could try to "lift the veil that hangs over the origin and progress of the organic world", Darwin was troubled by Grant's [[atheism]] and could see that [[Transmutation of species|transmutation]] was far from respectable.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp=39–41}}&lt;/ref&gt; Darwin later recalled "I listened in silent astonishment, and as far as I can judge, without any effect on my mind. I had previously read the Zoönomia of my grandfather, in which similar views are maintained, but without producing any effect on me."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1958|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1497&amp;pageseq=51 49]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly afterwards Coldstream graduated and went to Paris for his hospital study, where he suffered a [[mental breakdown]], struggling with "the foul mass of corruption within my own bosom", held captive to his body by "corroding desires" and "lustful imaginations". The doctor's report was that though Coldstream had led "a blameless life", he was "more or less in the dark on the vital question of religion, and was troubled with doubts arising from certain Materialist views, which are, alas!, too common among medical students".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Browne|1995|p=87}}&lt;br&gt;{{harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|p=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Geology and ''Origin of the Species''===
Darwin also took the popular natural history course of Professor [[Robert Jameson]], learning about [[stratigraphy|stratigraphic]] geology. Jameson was a [[Neptunism|Neptunian]] geologist who taught that strata had precipitated from a universal ocean: he held debates with chemistry professor [[Thomas Charles Hope]] who held that granites had crystallised from molten crust, ideas influenced by the [[Plutonism]] of [[James Hutton]] who had been Hope's friend. Jameson's view was that "It would be a misfortune if we all had the same way of thinking... Dr Hope is decidedly opposed to me, and I am opposed to Dr Hope, and between us we make the subject interesting." Darwin liked Hope and found Jameson a boring speaker. It is not known what he made of Jameson's closing lectures on the ''"Origin of the Species of Animals"''. Darwin enjoyed practicals in the Museum and course field trips, learning the sequence of strata. The [[Royal Museum|Museum of Edinburgh University]] was Jameson's preserve and was then one of the largest in Europe. Darwin assisted and made full use of the collections, spending hours studying, taking notes and stuffing animal specimens.

Even medical lectures proved of some use. In January 1826 Darwin had written home complaining of "a long stupid lecture" from Dr. Andrew Duncan ''secundus'' about medicine, but the lectures introduced him to [[Augustin de Candolle]]'s ''natural system'' of classification and emphasis on the "war" between competing species. However, he loathed medicine and left in April 1827 without a degree.

He toured Scotland, went on to [[Belfast]] and [[Dublin]] and in May made his first trip to London to visit his sister Caroline. They joined his uncle [[Josiah Wedgwood II]] on a trip to France. There Charles fended for himself for a few weeks in Paris with Browne and Coldstream who was recovering having "found joy and peace in believing". Charles rejoined his relations and then returned to his home at [[Shrewsbury, Shropshire]] by July.

==University of Cambridge==
[[File:Christs shield.png|thumb|right|175px|The coat of arms of [[Christ's College, Cambridge]], a college of the [[University of Cambridge]] where Darwin was enrolled to become a clergyman.]]

His father was unhappy that his younger son would not become a physician and "was very properly vehement against my turning an idle sporting man, which then seemed my probable destination." He therefore enrolled Charles at [[Christ's College, Cambridge]] in 1827 for a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree as the qualification required before taking a specialised divinity course and becoming an Anglican [[parson]]. He enrolled for an ''[[British undergraduate degree classification|ordinary]]'' degree, as at that time only capable mathematicians would take the [[Tripos]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Browne|1995|pp=89–91}}&lt;br&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1958|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1497&amp;pageseq=58 56_57]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=JvW&gt;{{Harvnb|van Wyhe|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that time the only way to get an honours degree was the mathematical Tripos examination, or the classical Tripos created in 1822, which was only open to those who already had high honours in mathematics, or those who were the sons of [[Peerage|peers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Smith, Jonathan C. |title=Teaching and learning in nineteenth-century Cambridge |publisher=Boydell Press |location=Ipswich |year=2002 |page=207 |isbn=0-85115-783-1 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This was a respectable career for a gentleman at a time when most naturalists in England were clergymen in the tradition of [[Gilbert White]], who saw it as part of their duties to "explore the wonders of God's creation". Charles had concerns about being able to declare his belief in all the dogmas of the [[Church of England]], so as well as hunting and fishing, he studied [[divinity]] books. He was particularly convinced by the reasoning of the Revd. [[John Bird Sumner]]'s ''Evidences of Christianity''.  John Bird Summer wrote that Jesus's religion was "wonderfully suitable... to our ideas of happiness in this &amp; the next world" and there was "no other way... of explaining the series of evidence &amp; probability." His Classics had lapsed since school, and he spent the autumn term at home studying Greek with a tutor. Darwin was accepted as a "pensioner", having paid his fees, on 15 October 1827, but did not attend Cambridge until the Lent Term which began on 13 January 1828. Eras returned from Edinburgh ready to sit his [[Bachelor of Medicine]] exam, and in the new year he and Charles set out together for Cambridge.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp=47–49}}&lt;br&gt;{{cite web |url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/EditorialIntroductions/vanWyhe_Christs.html |title=Darwin Online: The Admissions books of Christ's College, Cambridge |accessdate=20 December 2008}}&lt;br&gt;{{acad|id=DRWN827CR|name=Darwin, Charles Robert}}&lt;/ref&gt; Darwin came into residence in Cambridge on 26 January 1828, and [[matriculation|matriculated]] at the University's Senate House on 26 February.&lt;ref name=JvW/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/cambridgeshire/7958710.stm|title=Darwin's 'gentleman' student days|author=Anonymous|date=23 March 2009|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=2 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His tutors at [[Christ's College, Cambridge]] were to include [[Joseph Shaw (Christ's College)|Joseph Shaw]] in 1828, [[John Graham (bishop)|John Graham]] (in 1829 - 1830) and [[Edward John Ash]] in 1830 - 1831. One of his university friends was [[Frederick Watkins (clergyman)|Frederick Watkins]], (1808 - 1888).&lt;ref name=JvW2&gt;{{Harvnb|van Wyhe|2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Beetle collecting===
Arriving at the [[University of Cambridge]] in January 1828, Darwin found  this elite theological training institution governed by complex rules much more congenial than his experiences at Edinburgh. No rooms were available at [[Christ's College, Cambridge|Christ's College]], so he took lodgings above a [[tobacconists]] in Sidney Street, across the road.  Extramural activities were important, and while Darwin did not take up sports or debating, his interests included music and his main passion was the current national craze for the (competitive) collecting of [[beetle]]s. Trainee clergymen scoured [[Cambridgeshire]] for specimens, referring to ''An Introduction to [[Entomology]]'' by [[William Kirby (entomologist)|William Kirby]] and [[William Spence (entomologist)|William Spence]]. Charles joined his older cousin [[William Darwin Fox]] who was already a skilled collector and like him got a small dog. The two and their dogs became inseparable.  They explored the countryside as Darwin learnt about [[natural history]] from his cousin. Darwin became obsessed with winning the student accolade and collected avidly. Once he stripped bark from a dead tree and caught a [[ground beetle]] in each hand, then saw the rare Crucifix Ground Beetle,  ''[[Panagaeus cruxmajor]]''. With the habits of an egg-collector, he popped one ground beetle in his mouth to free his hand, but it ejected some intensely acrid fluid which burnt his tongue and Darwin was forced to spit it out. He lost all three.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|p=59}} describes the incident and states that the insect Darwin popped into his mouth was a [[bombardier beetle]].&lt;br&gt;*They cite Darwin's correspondence and his ''Autobiography'' ({{harvnb|Darwin|1958|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F1497&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=64 62–63].}})&lt;br&gt;*{{cite web |url=http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/darwin/young/lifelong.php |title=Darwin: Young Naturalist |work=American Museum of Natural History |accessdate=12 July 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101221210143/http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/darwin/young/lifelong.php |archivedate=21 December 2010 |df=dmy-all }} quotes the ''Autobiography'', and while its illustration shows a bombardier beetle, it says "Many beetles, including the ''[[Brachinus crepitans]]'' and the ''[[Stenaptinus insignis]]'', release irritating chemicals as a defense."&lt;br&gt;*[http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/darwinletters/calendar/entry-1009.html Letter 1009 — Darwin, C.

Fox introduced him for advice on identification to the [[John Stevens Henslow|Revd. John Stevens Henslow]], professor of botany, and Darwin began attending his soirées, a club for budding naturalists. Here he could meet other professors including the geologist the [[Adam Sedgwick|Revd. Adam Sedgwick]] and the new [[mineralogy|mineralogist]] the [[William Whewell|Revd. William Whewell]].

In the summer Darwin paid visits to Squire Owen, and romance seemed to be blossoming with the squire's daughter Fanny. Darwin joined other Cambridge friends on a three-month "reading party" at [[Barmouth]] on the coast of [[Wales]] to revise their studies with private tutors. For Charles it was an "Entomo-Mathematical expedition". Though he badly needed to catch up with his mathematics, the insect collecting predominated along with pleasant diversions such as [[hillwalking]], boating and [[fly fishing]]. He went on daily walks with his close friend, the older student [[John Maurice Herbert]] who he dubbed "Cherbury" after [[Edward Herbert, 1st Baron Herbert of Cherbury|Herbert of Cherbury]], the father of English [[Deism]]. Herbert assisted with the insect collecting, but the usual outcome was that Darwin would examine Herbert's collecting bottle and say "Well, old Cherbury, none of these will do."&lt;ref name=francis166&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1887|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1452.1&amp;pageseq=184 176–171]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September Darwin wrote to tell "My dear old ''Cherbury''" that his own catches had included "some of the rarest of the British Insects, &amp; their being found near Barmouth is quite unknown to the Entomological world: I think I shall write &amp; inform some of the crack Entomologists." He described these ''"extremely rare"'' insects and asked Herbert to oblige him by collecting some more of them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/entry-47 |title=Letter 47 – Darwin, C. R. to Herbert, J. M., (13 Sept 1828) |publisher= Darwin Correspondence Project }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second year doldrums===
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[A Devil's Chaplain]] --&gt;
At the start of his second year Charles became the tenant of the rooms at Christ's College which traditionally had been occupied by the theologian [[William Paley]]. He now had breakfast every day with his older cousin [[William Darwin Fox]]. This was Fox's last term before his BA exam, and he now had to cram desperately to make up for lost time. At the Christmas holiday Charles visited London with Eras, toured the scientific institutions "where Naturalists are gregarious" and through his friend the Revd. [[Frederick William Hope]] met other insect collectors. These included [[James Francis Stephens|James Stephens]], author of ''Illustrations of British Entomology".

The January term brought miserable weather and a struggle to keep up with his studies. Around this time, he had an earnest conversation with [[John Maurice Herbert|John Herbert]] about going into Holy Orders, and asked him whether he could answer yes to the question that the Bishop would put in the ordination service, "Do you trust that you are inwardly moved by the Holy Spirit". When Herbert said that he could not, Darwin replied "Neither can I, and therefore I cannot take orders" to become an ordained priest.&lt;ref name=francis166/&gt; Even his interest in insect collecting waned. He fell out with one of the two locals he employed to catch beetles when he found that the local was giving first choice to a rival collector. In the doldrums, he joined a crowd of drinking pals in a frequent "debauch". He put in some hard riding. On one night he and three friends saw the sky lit up and "rode like incarnate devils" eleven miles to see the blaze. They arrived back at two in the morning and violated curfew. He was risking "[[rustication (academia)|rustication]]", temporary expulsion. Such behaviour would be noticed by the [[Proctor]]s, university officials appointed from the colleges who patrolled the town in plain gowns to police the students.

Student resentment against two unpopular Proctors built up, and on 9 April 1829 a tumult broke out. Charles described how the Senior Proctor was "most gloriously hissed.. &amp; pelted with mud", being "driven so furious" that his servant "dared not go near him for an hour."&lt;ref name=Letter61&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/darwinletters/calendar/entry-61.html |title=Darwin Correspondence Project – Letter 61 – Darwin, C. R. to Fox, W. D., (10 Apr 1829)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Proctors had noted some faces in the mob, and four were rusticated and one fined for being out-of-gown and shouting abuse. Outraged by this leniency, the Proctors quit ''en masse'' and printed their resignation to post up around the colleges. Though the unpopular Proctors were gone, Charles was jolted into thinking of the consequences of [[Theory of criminal justice|law-breaking]].

In the Spring, Darwin enrolled for [[John Stevens Henslow]]'s lectures on [[botany]]. Professor Henslow's first "public herborizing expedition" of the year took place in May, an outing on which students assisted with collection of plants. However, Darwin made no mention of Henslow in his letters to Fox.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp=70, 76}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 18 May Darwin wrote to Fox enthusing about his success with beetle collecting, "I think I beat Jenyns in Colymbetes", contrasted with his lack of application to studies: "my time is solely occupied in riding &amp; Entomologizing".&lt;ref name="Letter 64"&gt;{{Cite web  | title = Letter 64 &amp;#8212; Darwin, C.

[[Cambridge]] was briefly visited on 21 May by the Radicals [[Richard Carlile]] and the [[Robert Taylor (Radical)|Revd. Robert Taylor]], both recently jailed for blasphemy, on an "infidel home missionary tour" which caused several days of controversy. Taylor was later nicknamed "[[A Devil's Chaplain|the Devil's Chaplain]]", a phrase remembered by Darwin.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp=70–73}}&lt;br&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/darwinletters/calendar/entry-1924.html#back-mark-1924.f2 |title=Darwin Correspondence Project – Letter 1924 – Darwin, C.

Charles had been sending records of the insects he had caught to the entomologist [[James Francis Stephens]], and was thrilled when Stevens published about thirty of these records in ''Illustrations of British entomology; or, a synopsis of indigenous insects etc.'' which was printed in parts, with the first description under Darwin's name appearing in an appendix dated 15 June 1829.&lt;ref name=Darwinsinsects&gt;{{cite web |url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/EditorialIntroductions/vanWyhe_Stephens.html |title=Darwin Online: Darwin's insects in Stephens' Illustrations of British entomology (1829–32) |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

That summer, amongst horse riding and beetle collecting, Charles visited his cousin Fox, and this time Charles was teaching entomology to his older cousin. Home at [[Shrewsbury, Shropshire]], he saw his brother Erasmus whose "delicate frame" led to him now giving up medicine and retiring at the age of 26. The brothers visited the [[History of Birmingham|Birmingham]] Music Festival for what Charles described as the "most glorious" experience.

===Third year, theology and natural history===
Back at Cambridge, Charles studied hard for his ''Little Go'' preliminary exam, as a fail would mean a re-sit the following year. He dropped his drinking companions and resumed attending [[John Stevens Henslow|Henslow]]'s Friday evening soirées. For the exam he slogged away at Greek and Latin, and studied [[William Paley]]'s ''Evidences of Christianity'', becoming so delighted with Paley's logic that he learnt it well. This was a text he also had to study for his finals, and he was "convinced that I could have written out the whole of the ''Evidences'' with perfect correctness, but not of course in the clear language of Paley." Later, on the [[second voyage of HMS Beagle|''Beagle'' expedition]], he saw evidence which challenged Paley's rose-tinted view, but at this time he was convinced that the Christian revelation established "a future state of reward and punishment" which "gives order for confusion: makes the moral world of a piece with the natural". As with Cambridge University, God gave authority and assigned stations in life, misconduct was penalised and excellence bountifully rewarded. Charles took the one-day verbal examination on 24 March 1830. There were three hours in the morning on the classics and three in the afternoon on the [[New Testament]] and Paley. The next day he was delighted to be informed that he had passed.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Desmond|Moore|pp. 76–79}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dar57&gt;{{Harvnb|Darwin|1958|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1497&amp;pageseq=59 57–67]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several of his friends celebrated their examination successes  by dining in each other's rooms in rotation in a weekly club commonly known as the ''Glutton Club''. This name was proposed to ridicule another group whose Greek title meant "fond of dainties", but who dined out on "Mutton Chops, or Beans &amp; Bacon". The ''Glutton Club'' attempted to live up to their title by experimentally dining on "birds and beasts which were before unknown to human palate" and tried hawk and [[bittern]], but gave up after eating an old brown owl, "which was indescribable". They had more amusement from concluding each meeting with "a game of mild [[Blackjack|vingt-et-un]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=side&amp;itemID=CUL-DAR112.B57-B76&amp;pageseq=14 |title= (Recollections of Darwin at Cambridge) CUL-DAR112.B57-B76 |author=Herbert, John Maurice |authorlink= |date= 2 June 1882 |publisher=Darwin Online |pages=70–72 |accessdate=28 April 2009}}&lt;br&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1887|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1452.1&amp;pageseq=187 169–170]}}&lt;br&gt;{{harvnb|Freeman|1978|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=A27&amp;pageseq=159 152]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over Easter Charles stayed at Cambridge, mounting and cataloguing his beetle collection. He then became an enthusiastic member of the [[botany]] course which the "good natured &amp; agreeable" professor Henslow taught five days a week in the Botanic Gardens and on field trips. Henslow's outings were attended by 78 men including professor Whewell. Charles became the "favourite pupil", known as "the man who walks with Henslow", helping to find specimens and to set up "practicals" dissecting plants. He became interested in pollen. One day he watched through a microscope and saw "transparent cones" emerge from the side of a [[geranium]] pollen grain. Then one burst spraying out "numberless granules". Henslow explained that the granules were indeed the constituent atoms of pollen, but they had no intrinsic vital power – life was endowed from outside and ultimately derived its power from God, whatever more "speculative" naturalists argued regarding self-activating power. Darwin had been taught otherwise by Grant, and reflected quietly on this, biding his time.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Desmond|Moore|pp. 80–82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the summer holidays Darwin arranged to meet Fox at The Mount, but Darwin's father had been ill and family tensions led to a row. Charles went off with the Revd. Hope and other friends for three weeks "entomologizing" in North Wales, hunting for beetles and trout fishing. He went partridge shooting at Maer before returning home.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Desmond|Moore|pp. 82–83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fourth year finals and later attitude towards mathematics ===
Back at Cambridge, his final exams loomed. A "desperate" Charles focused on his studies and got private tuition from Henslow whose subjects were mathematics and theology. This term he had to study [[Euclid]] and learn Paley's ''Principles of Moral and Political Philosophy'', though this old text was becoming outdated. It opposed arguments for increased democracy, but saw no divine right of rule for the sovereign or the state, only "expediency".  Government could be opposed if grievances outweighed the danger and expense to society.  The judgement was "Every man for himself". These ideas had suited the conditions of reasonable rule prevailing when the text was published in 1785, but in 1830 they were dangerous ideas. At this time the French king was deposed by middle class republicans and given refuge in England by the [[Tory]] government. In response, radical street protests demanded [[suffrage]], [[Social equality|equality]] and [[freedom of religion]].  Then in November the Tory administration collapsed and the [[British Whig Party|Whigs]] took over. Paley's text even supported abolition of the ''[[Thirty-nine Articles]] of the [[Anglican]] faith'' which every student at Cambridge (and [[Oxford University]]) was required to sign. Henslow insisted that "he should be grieved if a single word... was altered" and emphasised the need to respect authority.  This happened even as campaigns of civil disobedience spread to starving agricultural labourers and villages close to Cambridge suffered riots and arson attacks.

In the third week of January 1831 Charles sat his final exam.  There were three days of written papers covering the Classics, the two Paley texts and [[John Locke]]'s ''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]'', then mathematics and physics. At the end of the week when the results were posted he was dazed and proud to have come 10th out of a pass list of 178 doing the ''ordinary'' degree. Charles shone in theology and scraped through in the other subjects. He was also exhausted and depressed, writing to Fox "I do not know why the degree should make one so miserable."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp=87–88}}&lt;/ref&gt; In later life he recalled Paley and Euclid being the only part of the course which was useful to him, and "By answering well the examination questions in Paley, by doing Euclid well, and by not failing miserably in Classics, I gained a good place among the [[Hoi_polloi#Appearances_in_the_nineteenth_century|οἱ πολλοί]], or crowd of men who do not go in for honours."&lt;ref name=dar57 /&gt;

On the specific issue of his mathematical education, Darwin came to regret his lack of ability and application: "I attempted mathematics, and even went during the summer of 1828 with a private tutor (a very dull man) to Barmouth, but I got on very slowly. The work was repugnant to me, chiefly from my not being able to see any meaning in the early steps in algebra. This impatience was very foolish, and in after years I have deeply regretted that I did not proceed far enough at least to understand something of the great leading principles of mathematics, for men thus endowed seem to have an extra sense".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.turtlereader.com/authors/charles-darwin/the-life-and-letters-of-charles-darwin-day-13-of-188/ Darwin Correspondence Cambridge 1828-1831]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Natural theology and geology===

Sculpted by [[Anthony Smith (sculptor)|Anthony Smith]], the statue features some of the books Darwin was reading at this time; [[Alexander von Humboldt|Humboldt’s]] ''Personal Narrative'', [[William Paley|Paley’s]] ''[[Natural Theology or Evidences of the Existence and Attributes of the Deity|Natural Theology]]'', [[John Herschel|Herschel’s]] ''Preliminary Discourse on Natural Philosophy'' and James Stephens’ ''Illustrations of British Entomology''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Young Man!

Residence requirements kept Darwin in Cambridge till June. He resumed his beetle collecting, took career advice from Henslow, and read [[William Paley]]'s ''[[Natural Theology or Evidences of the Existence and Attributes of the Deity]]'' which set out to refute [[David Hume]]'s argument that [[Teleological argument|"design" by a Creator]] was merely a human projection onto the forces of nature. Paley saw a rational proof of God's existence in the complexity and perfect [[adaptation]] to needs of living beings exquisitely fitted to their places in a happy world, while attacking the evolutionary ideas of [[Erasmus Darwin]] as coinciding with atheistic schemes and lacking evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Paley|1809|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=A142&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=437 431–433], [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=A142&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=462 456].}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paley's benevolent God acted in nature though uniform and universal laws, not arbitrary miracles or changes of laws, and this use of secondary laws provided a [[theodicy]] explaining the [[problem of evil]] by separating nature from direct divine action. This convinced Charles and encouraged his interest in science.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|von Sydow|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later wrote "I do not think I hardly ever admired a book more than Paley's ''Natural Theology'': I could almost formerly have said it by heart."&lt;ref name=Letter2532&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/darwinletters/calendar/entry-2532.html |title=Darwin Correspondence Project – Letter 2532 – Darwin, C.

He read [[John Herschel]]'s new ''Preliminary Discourse on the Study of Natural Philosophy'', learning that nature was governed by laws, and the highest aim of [[natural philosophy]] was to understand them through an orderly process of [[Inductive reasoning|induction]], balancing observation and theorising. This was part of the [[liberal Christianity]] of Darwin's tutors, who saw no disharmony between honest inductive science and religion. Such science was religion, and could not be heretical.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Browne|1995|pp=128–129}},&lt;br&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/darwinletters/calendar/entry-94.html |title=Darwin Correspondence Project – Letter 94 – Darwin, C.

As a young graduate, Henslow had geologised on the [[Isle of Wight]] and the [[Isle of Man]], and he too had longed to visit Africa. Marriage and his position at the university now made the prospect remote, but he still had an unfulfilled ambition to "explore regions but little known, and enrich science with new species."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|p=91}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

At home for Easter in early April, Darwin told his cousin Fox of "a scheme I have almost hatched" to visit the [[Canary Islands]] and see [[Tenerife]] as recommended by Humboldt.&lt;ref name=Letter96&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/darwinletters/calendar/entry-96.html |title=Darwin Correspondence Project – Letter 96 – Darwin, C.

Henslow &amp; other Dons give us great credit for our plan: Henslow promises to cram me in geology". He was studying Spanish language, and was in "a Tropical glow".&lt;ref name="letter98"&gt;{{Cite web  | last =  | first =  | title = Darwin Correspondence Project – Letter 98 – Darwin, C.

Henslow introduced Darwin to the great geologist the [[Adam Sedgwick|Revd. Adam Sedgwick]] who had been his own tutor, and shared views on religion, politics and morals. Darwin was fired up by Sedgwick's Spring course of "equestrian outings" with its vistas of the grandeur of God's creation, so much of which was yet unexplored.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Browne|1995|pp=136–138}}&lt;/ref&gt; He exclaimed, "What a capital hand is Sedgewick for drawing large cheques upon the Bank of Time!".&lt;ref name=Letter101&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/darwinletters/calendar/entry-101.html |title=Darwin Correspondence Project – Letter 101 – Darwin, C.

Darwin continued plotting his "Canary scheme", and on 11 May he told Fox "My other friends most sincerely wish me there I plague them so with talking about tropical scenery &amp;c &amp;c.". His father gave him "a 200£ note" to pay his college debts. In addition, "Some goodnatured Cambridge man has made me a most magnificent anonymous present of a Microscope: did ever hear of such a delightful piece of luck? one would like to know who it was, just to feel obliged to him."&lt;ref name=Letter100&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/darwinletters/calendar/entry-100.html |title=Darwin Correspondence Project – Letter 100 – Darwin, C.

In mid June Darwin returned home to Shrewsbury, and continued "working like a tiger" for the Canary scheme, "at present Spanish &amp; Geology, the former I find as intensely stupid, as the latter most interesting". By then his most likely companion on the trip was the tutor Marmaduke Ramsay. Darwin was "trying to make a map" of [[Shropshire]], "but dont find it so easy as I expected."&lt;ref name=Letter101/&gt; He ordered a [[Inclinometer|clinometer]], and on 11 July wrote to tell Henslow that it had arrived and he had tried it out in his bedroom. "As yet I have only indulged in hypotheses; but they are such powerful ones, that I suppose, if they were put into action but for one day, the world would come to an end."&lt;ref name=Letter102&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/darwinletters/calendar/entry-102.html |title= Darwin Correspondence Project – Letter 102 – Darwin, C.

R. to Whitley, C. T., (19 July 1831) | url = http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/entry-102a }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 August 1831 Sedgwick arrived in his gig at [[The Mount, Shrewsbury]], to take Charles as his assistant on a short geological expedition mapping strata in [[Wales]]. That evening Charles told of a tropical shell found in a nearby gravel pit and was impressed when Sedgwick responded that it must have been thrown away there, as it contradicted the known geology of the area. This made him realise "that science consists in grouping facts so that general laws or conclusions may be drawn from them." Sedgwick aimed to investigate and correct possible errors in [[George Bellas Greenough|George Greenough]]'s geological map of 1820, and to trace the fossil record to the earliest times to rebut the [[uniformitarianism (science)|uniformitarian]] ideas just published by [[Charles Lyell]].&lt;ref name=wales/&gt; 
On the morning of 5 August they went from Shrewsbury to [[Llangollen]], and on 11 August reached [[Penrhyn Quarry]].&lt;ref name=lucas/&gt; After less than a week of doing hard practical work Charles had learnt how to identify specimens, interpret strata and generalise from his observations.  Then he went off on his own to collect samples and investigate the [[Vale of Clwyd]], looking in vain for the [[Old Red Sandstone]] shown by Greenough. They met up in [[Colwyn]], and Sedgwick's pleasure at the confirmation that the map was incorrect made Darwin "exceedingly proud". They went on to [[Capel Curig]] where Charles struck out on his own across 30&amp;nbsp;miles (50&amp;nbsp;km) of "some strange wild places" to Barmouth.&lt;ref name=wales&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1958|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1497&amp;pageseq=70 68–72].}}&lt;br&gt;{{harvnb|Browne|1995|pp=139–143}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had parted from Sedgwick by 20 August, and travelled via [[Ffestiniog]].&lt;ref name=lucas&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/EditorialIntroductions/Lucas_Lowe_Journal.html |title=The recovery of time past: Darwin at Barmouth on the eve of the Beagle  |author=Peter Lucas |date=1 January 2010 |publisher=Darwin Online |accessdate=21 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Voyage on the Beagle==
Arriving at [[Barmouth]] on the evening of 23 August, Charles met up with a "reading party" of Cambridge friends for a time before he left on the morning of 29 August,&lt;ref name=lucas/&gt; to go back to Shrewsbury and on to partridge shooting with his Wedgwood relatives at [[Maer Hall]].&lt;ref name=wales/&gt; He was grieved to have received a message that Ramsay had died. This upset Darwin's plans for a visit in the following year to Tenerife. He arrived home at [[The Mount, Shrewsbury]], on 29 August, and found a letter from Henslow.&lt;ref name=Letter107&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/darwinletters/calendar/entry-107.html |title=Darwin Correspondence Project – Letter 107 – Darwin, C. R. to Henslow, J. S., 30 (Aug 1831)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Cambridge Fellow [[George Peacock]] had heard from [[Francis Beaufort]] of plans for the [[Second voyage of HMS Beagle|second survey voyage of]] [[HMS Beagle|HMS ''Beagle'']], and had written to Henslow proposing [[Leonard Jenyns]] as "a proper person to go out as a naturalist with this expedition", or if he was unavailable seeking recommendations for an alternative to take up this "glorious opportunity". When Jenyns decided not to leave his parish, he and Henslow thought of Darwin.&lt;ref name=Letter104&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/darwinletters/calendar/entry-104.html |title=Darwin Correspondence Project – Letter 104 – Peacock, George to Henslow, J. S., (6 or 13 Aug 1831)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Henslow's letter, read by Peacock and forwarded to Darwin, expected him to eagerly catch at the likely offer of a two-year trip to [[Tierra del Fuego|Terra del Fuego]] &amp; home by the [[Indies|East Indies]], not as "a ''finished'' Naturalist", but as a ''[[gentleman]]'' "amply qualified for collecting, observing, &amp; noting any thing worthy to be noted in Natural History". The appointment was more as a companion to Captain [[Robert FitzRoy]], than as a mere collector. Henslow wrote "I assure you I think you are the very man they are in search of".&lt;ref name=Letter105&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/darwinletters/calendar/entry-105.html |title=Darwin Correspondence Project – Letter 105 – Henslow, J. S. to Darwin, C. R., 24 Aug 1831 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

His father thought the voyage a waste of his son's time and strongly objected. Dejected, Charles declined the offer,&lt;ref name=Letter107/&gt; and went to Maer for the partridge shooting with a note from his father to [[Josiah Wedgwood II|"Uncle Jos" Wedgwood]]. This contained a prescription for a bowel ailment and a note saying that Charles had quite given up the proposed "voyage of discovery", but "if you think differently from me I shall wish him to follow your advice."&lt;ref name=Letter108&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/darwinletters/calendar/entry-108.html |title=Darwin Correspondence Project – Letter 108 – Darwin, R. W. to Wedgwood, Josiah, II, 30–1 Aug (1831) |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Charles' hopes were revived by this unexpected news, and his relatives came out in favour of the voyage. He outlined his father's objections, and sat up that night drafting a reply with his uncle. Jos wrote suggesting that Charles would be likely to "acquire and strengthen, habits of application", and "Natural History... is very suitable to a Clergyman." Though "useless as regards his profession", for "a man of enlarged curiosity, it affords him such an opportunity of seeing men and things as happens to few". The Admiralty would look after him well, but "you &amp; Charles... must decide."&lt;ref name=Letter110&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/darwinletters/calendar/entry-110.html |title=Darwin Correspondence Project – Letter 110 – Darwin, C. R. to Darwin, R.

About 10 o'clock he received word from his uncle that they should go to The Mount at once.&lt;ref name=Letter110/&gt; When they arrived a few hours later, Charles' father had decided that he would give "all the assistance in my power".&lt;ref name=Letter111&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/darwinletters/calendar/entry-111.html |title=Darwin Correspondence Project – Letter 111 – Darwin, R.

'''Christopher Gustavus Memminger''' (born '''Christoph Gustav Memminger'''; January 9, 1803&amp;nbsp;– March 7, 1888) was a German-born American politician and one of the founding fathers of the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate States]]. He was the principal author of the [[Provisional Constitution of the Confederate States|Provisional Constitution]] (1861), as well as the founder of the nation's financial system. As the first [[Confederate States Secretary of the Treasury]], Memminger was the main author of the economic policies of the [[Jefferson Davis]] administration.

==Early life and career==
Memminger was born on January 9, 1803, in &lt;!-- EDITORS NOTE: DO NOT CHANGE to "Vaihingen an der Enz" or "Nayhingen" as it would be historically and geographically inaccurate. It is a common mistake which has, unfortunately, been oft-repeated through the years; see [[Talk:Christopher Memminger]]. --&gt;Vaihingen, [[Electorate of Württemberg|Württemberg]] (present-day [[Stuttgart#Geography|Stuttgart-Vaihingen]], [[Germany]])&lt;!-- EDITORS NOTE: DO NOT CHANGE to "Vaihingen an der Enz" or "Nayhingen" as it would be historically and geographically inaccurate. It is a common mistake which has, unfortunately, been oft-repeated through the years; see [[Talk:Christopher Memminger]]. --&gt;. His father, Gottfried Memminger, was an [[Officer (armed forces)|officer]] who died a month after his son's birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Capers|1893|pp=7–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; His mother, Eberhardina ([[née]] Kohler) Memminger, immigrated to [[Charleston, South Carolina]], but died of [[yellow fever]] in 1807. Christopher was placed in an orphanage.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Patrick|1944|p=205}}&lt;/ref&gt; His fortunes changed when, at the age of eleven, he was taken under the care of [[Thomas Bennett, Jr.|Thomas Bennett]], a prominent lawyer and future Governor. He entered [[University of South Carolina|South Carolina College]] at the age of 12 and graduated second in his class at 16. Memminger passed the bar in 1825 and became a successful lawyer. He married Mary Withers Wilkinson in 1832.

He was a leader of the opponents during the [[Nullification Crisis|nullification excitement]]. He published ''The Book of Nullification'' (1832–33) which satirized the advocates of the doctrine in biblical style.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Appletons'|wstitle=Memminger, Charles Gustavus|year=1900}}&lt;/ref&gt; He entered state politics and served in the [[South Carolina]] state legislature from 1836 to 1852 and 1854 to 1860, where for nearly twenty years he was the head of the finance committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite NIE|wstitle=Memminger, Christopher Gustavus|year=1905}}&lt;/ref&gt; Memminger was a staunch advocate of education and helped give Charleston one of the most comprehensive public school systems in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Patrick|1944|pp=205–206}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1859, after [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]]'s raid, he was commissioned by [[South Carolina]] to consult with other delegates in [[Virginia]] as to the best method of warding off attacks of [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionists]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Americana|wstitle=Memminger, Christopher Gustavus}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==American Civil War==

Benjamin]], [[Stephen Mallory]], Christopher Memminger, [[Alexander Stephens]], [[LeRoy Pope Walker]], [[Jefferson Davis]], [[John Henninger Reagan|John H. Reagan]] and [[Robert Toombs]].]]
[[File:CSA-T33-$5-1862.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Memminger depicted on a 1862 [[Confederate States dollar|CS$]]5 [[banknote]].]]

Memminger was considered a moderate on the [[secession]] issue, but after [[Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln's]] election, he decided secession was necessary. When South Carolina seceded from the United States in 1860, Memminger was asked to write the ''[[Declaration of the Immediate Causes Which Induce and Justify the Secession of South Carolina from the Federal Union]]'' which outlined the reasons for secession. When other states also seceded, he was selected as a South Carolina delegate to the [[Provisional Congress of the Confederate States]], and was the chairman of the committee which drafted the Provisional Constitution of the Confederate States. The twelve-man committee produced a provisional constitution in only four days.

When [[Jefferson Davis]] formed his first cabinet, Memminger was chosen as Secretary of the Treasury on February 21, 1861. It was a difficult task, in view of the financial challenges facing the Confederacy. He attempted to finance the government initially via bonds and tariffs (and confiscation of gold from the [[New Orleans Mint|United States Mint]] in [[New Orleans]]), but soon found himself forced to more extreme measures such as [[income tax]]ation and [[fiat money|fiat currency]]. He had been a supporter of hard currency before the war, but found himself issuing increasingly devalued paper money, which by war's end was worth less than two percent of its face value in gold.{{Clear}}

==Resignation==
Memminger resigned his post as Secretary of the Treasury on July 1, 1864 and was replaced by fellow South Carolinian [[George Trenholm|G. A. Trenholm]]. He returned to his summer residence in [[Flat Rock, Henderson County, North Carolina|Flat Rock, North Carolina]]. In the post-war years, he returned to Charleston, received a presidential pardon in 1866, and returned to private law practice and business investment. He also continued his work on developing South Carolina's public education system and was voted to a final term in the state legislature in 1877.

'''Darko "Charlie" Jurković''' (born 20 April 1965 in [[Rijeka|Rijeka, Croatia]]) is a Croatian [[jazz guitar]]ist and composer.

== Biography ==
Jurković initially received classical music training on violin, before he changed his interest to jazz and guitar at the age of 15. Influenced by guitarists like [[Pat Metheny]], [[John Scofield]] and especially [[Stanley Jordan]] he dedicated himself to this instrument. Like Jordan, he started making notes on the instrument with both hands. He masters this technique of ''Two-Hand-[[Tapping]]'' completely, so that he can simultaneously play on two guitars melody and bass. Until 1997, he studied at the [[University of Music and Performing Arts Graz|University of Music and Performing Arts in Graz]] with [[Harry Pepl]], completing his master's degree.

There after he played in bands like the ''Kvartet Sensitive'', in the ''Europlane Orchestra'' and in the band of Boško Petrović,  including with Emil Spányi and Gino Comisso,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rirock.com/rirock-scena/darko-jurkovic-charlie-trio-jazz-na-kvadrat/ Darko Jurković (Charlie) Trio - Jazz na kvadrat]&lt;/ref&gt; but he also played in the trio of František Uhlíř (including live recordings with [[Duško Gojković|Dusko Goykovich]]). Under his own name, he put three albums and two as co-leaders. He toured not only through Central Europe, France and Turkey, but also in South America.

== Honors ==
Jurković was honored in the years 2000, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2006, 2007 and 2008 with the award of the Croatian Musicians Union for the best jazz guitarist; he also won the  [[Porin (music award)|Porin Prize]].

'''Emine Hatun''' ({{lang-ota|امینہ خاتون}}) was the principal consort of Sultan [[Mehmed I]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. She was the mother of Sultan [[Murad II]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.kultur.gov.tr/EN/belge/2-1277/sultan-ii-murad-han.html | title = Sultan Mehmed I Han | accessdate = 13 April 2011 | publisher=[[Ministry of Culture and Tourism (Turkey)|Republic of Turkey Ministry of Culture and Tourism]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the grandmother of Sultan [[Mehmed the Conqueror]].

==Early life==
Emine Hatun was born as a Dulkadir princess the daughter of Șaban Suli Bey, third ruler of the Dulkadirids (reign 1386-1398).{{sfn|Uluçay|1988|p=27}}{{sfn|Sakaoğlu|2008|p=77-8}}{{sfn|Vakfı|2002|p=179}} She had a brother Sadaka Bey, fourth ruler of the Dulkadirs (reign 1398-1399). She was the first cousin of Nasireddin Mehmed Bey fifth ruler of the Dulkadirids (reign 1399-1442).{{sfn|Lambton|1988|p=262-3}} Mehmed Bey's granddaughter [[Sittişah Hatun]], married [[Mehmed the Conqueror]] in 1449 and later her niece [[Gülbahar Hatun]] married [[Bayezid II]] and became the mother of [[Selim I]].

==Marriage==
In 1403,{{sfn|Kastritsis|1988|p=106}} when Mehmed had defeated his brother [[İsa Çelebi]] and [[İsfendiyar Bey]], the ruler of the [[Isfendiyarids]] who had formed an alliance with each other, he returned to Rum, and decided to make some alliances of his own. While he was feasting in Tokat, Karamanid ruler [[Mehmet II of Karaman|Mehmed Bey]] sent his head military judge, and ambassadors also arrived from the realm of Dulkadirids. Relations were mended and animosity was removed. Then there was made peace and friendship between them. At that time, gifts and tokens of betrothal were sent to the Emine Hatun, who was thus engaged to the Sultan. Mehmed Çelebi’s important marriage alliance with the ruler of the neighboring tribal confederation of Dulkadir, which was especially rich in horses and horsemen, demonstrates his continued emphasis on tribal politics.{{sfn|Kastritsis|2007|p=107}}{{sfn|Öztürk|2014|p=}} The alliance proved a great value for Nasireddin Mehmed Bey. This not only gave Mehmed armed assistance in his campaign for empire, but was always ready to attack the eastern provinces of the Karamanid principality.{{sfn|Pitcher|1968|p=60}} In 1404 she gave birth to the future Sultan [[Murad II]].{{sfn|Uluçay|1988|p=27}}

Faron Hall died in August 2014. Hall's body was recovered from the Red River on August 18/2014 by the Winnipeg Police Service.

==Biography==
Hall was born on the [[Dakota Tipi First Nation]] in [[Manitoba]] but spent most of his early years in foster care in Winnipeg.

Before 2007 he had been homeless for seven years, sleeping on the banks of the [[Red River of the North|Red River]].

In May 2009, while intoxicated he rescued a 19-year-old who had fallen from a bridge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salvationarmy.ca/2009/05/12intoxicated/the-homeless-hero/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130115234246/http://www.salvationarmy.ca/2009/05/12intoxicated/the-homeless-hero/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=15 January 2013 |title=The Homeless Hero |date=12 May 2009 |publisher=[[The Salvation Army, Canada]] |accessdate=12 February 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sam Katz]] presented him with the [[Mayor's Medal of Valour]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20090505/wpg_hall_homeless_hero_090505?hub=Canada|title=Medal of Valour for homeless hero|date=May 6, 2009|publisher=ctvwinnipeg.ca|accessdate=9 March 2010}}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and baseball season tickets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20090506/homeless_rescue_090506/20090506?hub=Canada|title=Homeless man a hero after saving teen from Red River|date=May 6, 2009|publisher=[[CTV News]]|accessdate=12 February 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090509151153/http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20090506/homeless_rescue_090506/20090506?hub=Canada|archivedate=9 May 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly afterwards, he moved into a government-owned apartment block.

In September 2009, once again while intoxicated he rescued a woman from drowning in the same river.

'''Gabriel Andreescu''' is a [[Romania]]n [[human rights activist]] and [[Political science|political scientist]] born on 8 April 1952 in [[Buzău]]. He is one of the few Romanian [[dissident]]s who openly opposed [[Nicolae Ceauşescu|Ceauşescu]] and the [[Socialist Republic of Romania|Communist regime in Romania]].

At present, he is professor with the Department of Political Science at the National School for Political Studies and Public Administration (SNSPA) in [[Bucharest]], and an active member of several Romanian [[human rights]] organizations. He is also a prodigious [[journalist]], writing and lecturing on topics such as [[multiculturalism]], national minorities, [[religious freedom]] and [[secularism]], the ethics and [[politics of memory]] and others. He is editor of the Romanian-language ''New Journal of Human Rights'' (''Noua Revista de Drepturile Omului'', formerly ''Revista Romana de Drepturile Omului'').

==Biography==
Andreescu attended the [[BP Hasdeu]] high school in his hometown, then obtained a BA in [[Physics]] from the [[University of Bucharest]]. He taught high school physics (1976–1980), then moved to Bucharest where he worked as a researcher for the National Institute for Meteorology and Hydrology (1980–1989). During this period he published academic papers on [[linguistics]], logics, and mathematical poetics among others.&lt;ref&gt;Some of these were published later as Gabriel Andreescu, ''Sistemele axiomatice ale logicii limbajului natural. Funcţii şi operaţionalizare'' (Bucharest, All, 1992).&lt;/ref&gt;

After the December 1989 [[Romanian Revolution of 1989|anti-Communist revolution]], Andreescu abandoned his career as a [[physicist]] to continue his activism for [[human rights]], [[democracy]], and the [[rule of law]]. His work as a human rights activist, political analyst, journalist, and writer blended with academic teaching and research.

===Dissidence under Communism===
Between 1983 -1987 Gabriel Andreescu dispatched clandestine information on human rights abuses in Romania to [[Radio Free Europe]] and wrote several [[anti-communist]] articles and studies, some of which he managed to send and publish abroad. He was investigated by the [[Securitate]] (the Romanian communist-era political police) starting with 1979. He was arrested for his anti-communist activities in December 1987 and indicted for treason (but freed in January 1988 as result of international protests, and put under surveillance till the fall of the Communist regime). Nevertheless, he continued to write and dispatch letters of protest to the Western media (1988–1989). Some of them (e.g., ''Lettre à la Conférence de Cracovie'' (1988) and ''Le devoir d’ingérence'' (1989)) were published in the Western press (''L’Autre Europe'' and ''Libération''). In June 1989 he went on a [[hunger strike]] as a protest against the continuous violation of human rights in Romania. He was demoted and placed by the Securitate under [[house arrest]] in Buzau, then again arrested, to be released after the revolution of December 1989.&lt;ref&gt;Gabriel Andreescu, ''L-am urât pe Ceauşescu. Ani, oameni, disidenţă'' (Polirom, Iaşi, 2009), 126-53.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Activity after December 1989===
After the anti-Communist revolution Andreescu became a member of the Council of the [[National Salvation Front (Romania)|National Salvation Front]], the first post-Communist governmental body after the revolution in 1989 (he soon resigned). He also initiated and was co-president of the Association for the Defense of Human Rights in Romania – the Romanian Helsinki Committee (APADOR-CH), where he also worked as expert on national minorities and [[freedom of conscience]] and [[freedom of religion|religion]]. He co-founded and was president of the [[Group for Social Dialogue]] (GDS), as well as founding member and vice-president of the Civic Alliance (AC).&lt;ref&gt;Gabriel Andreescu, ''Ruleta. Români şi maghiari, 1990-2000'' (Polirom, Iaşi, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

Gabriel Andreescu founded and headed other organizations developing strategies and projects in support of human rights, among them the Ombudspersons for National Minorities, the Center for International Studies, the Center of Inquiry-affiliated Center for Critical Conscience, and the Solidarity for Freedom of Conscience. He was a board member of several other organizations (Hungarian Europe Society, Ethnocultural Diversity Resource Center, Partnership for Equality, Open Society Foundation Expert Teams, Foundation for the Development of Civil Society), as well as a member of the scientific boards of other organizations.

Gabriel Andreescu also participated in international programs and [[research]], among which:
:Near neighborhood at the Eastern frontiers of the future [[European Union]] (The Centre for Policy Applied Research / Europe Team / Bonn)
:Managing Multi-Ethnic Communities: Textbook for schools of public administration in Central and Eastern Europe (Local Government Initiative / Open Society Institute / Budapest)

:Community Action Programme to Combat Discrimination: Preparatory Work to Establish Transnational Actions for the Development of Policy and/or Legal Responses to the Fight Against Discrimination on Grounds of Racial or Ethnic Origin, Religion or Beliefs, Disability, Age, And Sexual Orientation (EU Commission - Directorate-General Employment and Social Affairs).

As a journalist and political analyst, he contributed to several Romanian newspapers and magazines (''Ziua'', ''Timpul'', ''Observator cultural'', ''Revista 22'', ''Opinia'', ''Altera'', ''Cotidianul'' etc.); between 1994-2004 he wrote for ''Radio Free Europe''.

'''Henry Hill, Jr.''' (June 11, 1943 – June 12, 2012) was a criminal from the United States.  Between 1955 and 1980, Hill was associated with the [[Lucchese crime family]]. In 1980, Hill became an [[FBI]] [[informant]], and his testimony helped secure 50 convictions, including those of mob capo (captain) [[Paul Vario]] and [[James Burke (gangster)|James Burke]] on multiple charges.

Hill's life story was documented in the [[true crime]] book ''[[Wiseguy (book)|Wiseguy: Life in a Mafia Family]]'' by [[Nicholas Pileggi]].&lt;ref name="Pileggi" /&gt; ''Wiseguy'' was subsequently adapted by [[Martin Scorsese]] into the critically acclaimed film ''[[Goodfellas]]'', in which Hill was portrayed by [[Ray Liotta]].

==Early life==
Henry Hill, Jr. was born on June 11, 1943 in [[Manhattan|Manhattan, New York]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=heliospm|title=Wiseguy: ... Henry Hill (Uncensored Version)|date=2013-12-31|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBvdRT1P6cQ|accessdate=2018-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; to Henry Hill, Sr., an Irish immigrant and [[electrician]], and Carmela Costa Hill, a Sicilian. The working class family consisted of Henry and his eight siblings who grew up in [[Brownsville, Brooklyn|Brownsville]], a poorer area of the [[East New York, Brooklyn|East New York]] section of Brooklyn. From an early age, Hill admired the local mobsters who socialized across the street from his home, including [[Paul Vario]], a ''[[Caporegime|capo]]'' in the [[Lucchese crime family]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last = Allen|first = Nick|title = Goodfella Henry Hill still living in hiding 20 years after film release|newspaper = The Telegraph|date = July 23, 2010|url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/7906245/Goodfella-Henry-Hill-still-living-in-hiding-20-years-after-film-release.html|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1955, when Hill was 11 years old, he wandered into the cabstand across the street looking for a part-time after-school job.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pileggi|first1=Nicholas|title=Wiseguy: life in a mafia family|date=1986|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|location=New York|isbn=0-671-44734-3|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his early teens, he began running errands for patrons of Vario's storefront shoeshine, pizzeria, and dispatch cabstand. He first met the notorious hijacker and [[Lucchese crime family|Lucchese family]] associate [[James Burke (gangster)|James "Jimmy the Gent" Burke]] in 1956. The 13-year-old Hill served drinks and sandwiches at a card game and was dazzled by Burke's openhanded tipping. "He was [[Sawbuck#.2410|sawbuck]]ing me to death. Twenty here. Twenty there. He wasn't like anyone else I had ever met."&lt;ref name=Pileggi&gt;{{cite book|last=Pileggi|first=Nicholas|title=Wiseguy: Life in a Mafia Family|year=1986|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|location=New York|isbn=0-671-44734-3|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following year, [[Paul Vario]]'s younger brother, Vito "Tuddy" Vario, and older brother, Lenny Vario, presented Hill with a highly sought-after union card in the [[bricklayer]]s' local. Hill would be a "[[No-show job|no show]]", put on a building contractor's construction payroll, guaranteeing him a weekly salary of $190 ({{Inflation|US|190|1957|fmt=eq|r=-1}}){{Inflation/fn|US}}. This didn't mean Hill would be getting or keeping all that money every week. He received only a portion of it, and the rest was kept and divided among the Varios. The card also allowed Hill to facilitate pickup of daily [[Numbers game|policy bets]] and [[loan shark|loan]] payments to Vario from local construction sites. Once Hill had this "legitimate" job, he dropped out of high school, working exclusively for the Vario gangsters.&lt;ref&gt;Pileggi, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;

Hill's first encounter with arson occurred when the Rebel Cab Company cabstand opened just around the corner from Vario's business. The competing company's owner was from [[Alabama]], new to [[New York City]]. Sometime after midnight, Tuddy and Hill drove to the rival cabstand with a drum full of gasoline in the back seat of Tuddy's car. Hill smashed the cab windows and filled them with gasoline-soaked newspapers, then tossed in lit [[match books]].&lt;ref&gt;Pileggi, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Anchor|OfficialDocExistence}}Hill was first arrested when he was 16; his arrest record is one of the few official documents that prove his existence.&lt;ref&gt;Pileggi, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Hill and Lenny, Vario's equally underage son, attempted to use a stolen credit card to buy [[snow tires]] for Tuddy's wife's car. When Hill and Lenny returned to Tuddy's, two police detectives apprehended Hill. During a rough interrogation, Hill gave his name and nothing else; Vario's attorney later facilitated his release on bail. While a [[suspended sentence]] resulted, Hill's refusal to talk earned him the respect of both Vario and Burke. Burke, in particular, saw great potential in Hill. Like Burke, he was of Irish ancestry and therefore ineligible to become a "[[made man]]". The Vario crew, however, were happy to have associates of any ethnicity, so long as they made money and refused to cooperate with the authorities.&lt;ref&gt;Pileggi, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1960, at around 17 years old, Hill joined the Army, serving with the [[82nd Airborne Division]] at [[Fort Bragg]] in [[North Carolina]]. Hill claimed the timing was deliberate; the FBI investigation into the 1957 [[Apalachin Meeting|Apalachin mob summit meeting]] had prompted a [[United States Senate|Senate]] investigation into organized crime, and its links with businesses and unions. This resulted in the publication of a list of nearly 5,000 names of members and associates of the five major crime families. Hill searched through a partial list but could not find Vario listed among the Lucchese family.&lt;ref&gt;Pileggi, p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout his three-year enlistment, Hill maintained his mob contacts. He also continued to hustle: in charge of kitchen detail, he sold surplus food, [[loan shark]]ed pay advances to fellow soldiers, and sold tax-free cigarettes. Before his discharge, Hill spent two months in the [[stockade]] for stealing a local sheriff's car, and brawling in a bar with a civilian and Marines. In 1963, Hill returned to New York and began the most notorious phase of his criminal career: arson, intimidation,&lt;ref&gt;Pileggi, p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; running an organized stolen car ring,&lt;ref&gt;Pileggi, p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt; and hijacking trucks.&lt;ref&gt;Pileggi, p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1965, Hill met his future wife, [[Karen Friedman Hill|Karen Friedman]], through Paul Vario, Jr. Paul insisted that Hill accompany him on a [[double date]] at [[Frank Manzo|Frank "Frankie the Wop" Manzo]]'s restaurant, Villa Capra. According to Friedman the date was disastrous, and Hill stood her up at the next dinner date. Afterward, the two began going on dates at the [[Copacabana (nightclub)|Copacabana]] and other nightclubs, where Friedman was introduced to Hill's outwardly impressive lifestyle. {{Anchor|Eloped}}The two later got married in a large North Carolina wedding, attended by most of Hill's gangster friends.&lt;ref&gt;Pileggi, pp. 83-94&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Air France robbery&lt;!-- Hill was associated with 2 airport heists. One was at Air France, the other Lufthansa. This entry seems to combine facts from both. The Air France heist was a 2-man job while the Lufthansa heist was done by a team of men who commandeered airline employees and stole the ~$6 million in cash and jewels. --&gt; ===
{{Anchor|Air France robbery}}{{Main|Air France robbery}}
{{Disputed|Air France and Lufthansa conflated|what=section|date=August 2018}}
On April 7, 1967, Hill and [[Thomas DeSimone|Tommy DeSimone]] executed the [[Air France robbery]], following a tip-off from Robert "Frenchy" McMahon. The robbery was initially proposed to Hill in January 1967 as an armed heist of several bags containing $60,000 each from the [[Air France]] cargo terminal at [[John F. Kennedy International Airport]]. The targeted money was stored in a strong-room inside the Air France cargo hold, permanently protected by a security guard. Hill determined that an armed robbery would involve unnecessary risk and would be unlikely to succeed; instead, Hill devised a plan to steal the keys to the strong room from a security guard who carried them at all times. Hill conducted surveillance on the security guard during his leisure time and found the guard had a weakness for women. Hill and McMahon succeeded in getting the guard drunk before driving him to the Jade East Motel where he was introduced to a prostitute. While the guard was distracted, Hill retrieved the guard's set of keys from his discarded trousers and had copies made before returning the original keys, thus leaving the guard and his employers unaware of any breach in security. Hill entered the cargo terminal with Tommy DeSimone on April 7, 1967 following a tip-off from McMahon about a shipment of between $400,000 and $700,000 being made to the strong-room. Using the duplicate key, Hill and DeSimone stole $420,000 (equivalent to over $3.1 million in 2018) in cash from the strong-room, loading the money into a large suitcase. They entered and exited the cargo terminal unchallenged and unnoticed while the security guard was on a meal break. No shots were fired and the money was not reported missing until April 11, 1967. Hill shared the take from the heist with senior Mafia members, giving $120,000 in total to Paul Vario and Sebastian Aloi of the Colombo crime family, in recognition that the cargo terminal fell within the Colombo family's 'turf'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://americanmafiahistory.com/goodfella-henry-hill/|title=Goodfella Henry Hill|website=IMDb|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Restaurant ownership and murder of William "Billy Batts" Devino ===
Hill used his share of the robbery proceeds to purchase a restaurant on [[Queens Boulevard]], The Suite, initially aiming to run it as a legitimate business and provide 'distance' between himself and his mob associates. However, within several months, the nightclub had become another mob hangout. Hill later said that members of Lucchese and Gambino crews moved into the club en masse, including high-ranking Gambino family members who "were always there".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gangsters and Goodfellas|last=Hill|first=Henry|publisher=|year=2007|isbn=9781590771297|location=|pages=61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One incident in the restaurant which Hill considered the most significant was the murder in 1970 of Gambino family member William "Billy Batts" Devino (whose surname was also given as 'Bentvena')[https://nypost.com/2015/07/12/new-book-reveals-john-gottis-role-in-goodfellas-murder/], who had been recently released from prison. After an altercation in The Suite between Tommy DeSimone and Devino during a 'welcome-home' party for Devino on June 11, 1970, Hill stated that DeSimone and Jimmy Burke began planning his death. Devino was murdered inside The Suite several weeks later by DeSimone and Burke, with Hill assisting in the disposal of his body. Hill later claimed that "We knew what was coming"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and he had deliberately cleared out The Suite in anticipation of Devino's murder. Burke had got Devino heavily drunk before he was assaulted by DeSimone, who then pistol-whipped Devino into unconsciousness. Assuming he was dead, they drove to Pennsylvania to ensure that the body wouldn't be found. During the drive there, noises were coming from the trunk. Hill pulled the car over to open the trunk to find Devino still alive. The bloody and bruised Devino cried Hill's name before Hill stepped back and witnessed Burke and Desimone stab Devino to death. The actual motive for the murder involved loan-sharking rackets which Devino had run before being incarcerated; while he was in prison, the rackets had been taken over by DeSimone and Burke, who did not want to relinquish them. Witnessing the murder of Devino would haunt Hill for the rest of his life.

===Lufthansa heist===
{{Main|Lufthansa heist}}

===Drug business===
Hill began wholesaling [[marijuana]], [[cocaine]], [[heroin]], and [[quaaludes]] based on connections he made in prison; he earned enormous amounts of money. A young kid who was a "[[Mule (smuggling)|mule]]" of Hill's "ratted" Hill out to Narcotics Detectives Daniel Mann and William Broder. "The Youngster" (so named by the detectives) informed them that the supplier [Henry Hill] was connected to the [[Lucchese crime family]] and was a close friend to [[Paul Vario]] and to [[James Burke (mobster)|Jimmy Burke]] and "had probably been in on the [[Lufthansa heist|Lufthansa robbery]]". Knowing who Hill was and what he did, they put surveillance on him, taking pictures. They found out that Hill's old prison friend from Pittsburgh ran a dog-grooming salon as a front. Mann and Broder had "thousands" of [[phone tapping|wiretaps]] of Hill. But Hill and his crew used coded language in the conversations. Hill's wiretap on March 29 is an example of the bizarre vocabulary:

{{quote|text=Pittsburgh Connection: You know the golf club and the dogs you gave me in return?&lt;br /&gt;Hill: Yeah.&lt;br /&gt;Pittsburgh Connection: Can you still do that?&lt;br /&gt;Hill: Same kind of golf clubs?&lt;br /&gt;Pittsburgh Connection: No. No golf clubs. Can you still give me the dogs if I can pay for the golf clubs?&lt;br /&gt;Hill: Yeah. Sure.&lt;br /&gt;[portion of conversation omitted]&lt;br /&gt;Pittsburgh Connection: You front me the shampoo and I'll front you the dog pills. ... what time tomorrow?&lt;br /&gt;Hill: Anytime after twelve.&lt;br /&gt;Pittsburgh Connection: You won't hold my lady friend up?&lt;br /&gt;Hill: No.&lt;br /&gt;Pittsburgh Connection: Somebody will just exchange dogs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Pileggi | first =Nicholas | title =Wiseguy: Life in a Mafia Family | publisher =Simon &amp; Schuster |year=1986 | page = 319 | isbn = 0-671-44734-3}} Gives conversation.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Basketball fixing===
Hill and two Pittsburgh gamblers set up a [[point shaving]] scheme by convincing [[Boston College Eagles men's basketball|Boston College]] [[Center (basketball)|center]] Rick Kuhn to participate. Kuhn, who was a high school friend of one of the gamblers, encouraged teammates to participate in the [[1978–79 Boston College basketball point shaving scandal|scandal]].

Hill also claimed to have an [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] [[Official (basketball)|referee]] in his pocket who worked games at [[Madison Square Garden]] during the 1970s. The referee had incurred gambling debts on horse races.&lt;ref name="donaghy"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=philbrick/070727&amp;lpos=spotlight&amp;lid=tab5pos1 |title = Reformed mobster believes Donaghy might not be alone |accessdate = October 29, 2007 |author = Philbrick, Mike |date = August 2, 2007 |publisher = ESPN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1980 arrest===
On April 27, 1980, Hill was arrested on a narcotics-trafficking charge. He became convinced that his former associates planned to have him killed: Vario, for dealing drugs; and Burke, to prevent Hill from implicating him in the [[Lufthansa Heist]]. Hill heard on a wiretap that his associates Angelo Sepe and Anthony Stabile were anxious to have him killed, and that they were telling Burke that Hill "is no good", and that he "is a junkie". Burke told them "not to worry about it". Hill was more convinced by a surveillance tape played to him by federal investigators, in which Burke tells Vario of their need to have Hill "whacked."&lt;ref name=donaghy/&gt; But Hill still wouldn't talk to the investigators. While in his cell, the officers would tell Hill that the prosecutor, Ed McDonald, wanted to speak with him, and Hill would yell: "Fuck you and McDonald". Hill became even more paranoid because he thought Burke had officers on the inside and would have him killed.

While Karen was worried, she kept getting calls from [[James Burke (gangster)|Jimmy Burke]]'s wife, Mickey, asking when Hill was coming home, or if Karen needed anything. Hill knew the calls were prompted by Jimmy.

When Hill was finally released on bail, he met Burke at a restaurant they always went to. Burke told Hill they should meet at a bar that Hill had never heard of or seen before that was owned by "Charlie the Jap". However, Hill never met Burke there; instead they met at Burke's sweatshop with Karen and asked for the address in Florida where Hill was to kill Bobby Germaine's son with Anthony Stabile. Hill knew he was going to get killed in Florida, but he needed to stay on the streets to make money.

McDonald didn't want to take any chances and arrested Hill as a [[material witness]] in the Lufthansa robbery. Hill then agreed to become an informant and signed an agreement with the United States Department of Justice Organized Crime Strike Force on May 27, 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Pileggi | first =Nicholas | title =Wiseguy: Life in a Mafia Family | publisher =Simon &amp; Schuster |year=1986 | pages = 395–350 | isbn = 0-671-44734-3}} Gives most of the arrest story.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, former junior mob associate Greg Bucceroni alleged that, after Hill's 1980 arrest, Jimmy Burke offered him money to arrange a meeting between Bucceroni and Hill at a Brooklyn grocery store so that Burke could have Hill murdered gangland fashion, but Bucceroni decided quietly against having any involvement with the hit on Hill. Shortly afterwards, Burke and several other Lucchese crime family members were arrested by federal authorities.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

==Informant and the witness protection program==
Hill testified against his former associates to avoid a possible execution by his crew or going to prison for his crimes. His testimony led to 50 convictions.

[[Jimmy Burke (gangster)|Jimmy Burke]] was given 20 years in prison for the [[1978–79 Boston College basketball point shaving scandal|1978–79 Boston College point shaving scandal]], involving fixing Boston College basketball games. Burke was also later sentenced to life in prison for the murder of scam artist Richard Eaton. Burke died of lung cancer while serving his life sentence, on April 13, 1996, at the age of 64.

Paul Vario received four years for helping Henry Hill obtain a no-show job to get him paroled from prison. Vario was also later sentenced to ten years in prison for the extortion of air freight companies at [[JFK Airport]]. He died of [[respiratory failure]] on November 22, 1988, at age 73 while incarcerated in the [[Federal Correctional Institution, Fort Worth|FCI Federal Prison in Fort Worth]].

Hill, his wife Karen, and their two children (Gregg and Gina)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=On the Run: A Mafia Childhood|author= Hill, Gregg and Gina|date=October 14, 2004|publisher=Warner Books|ISBN=0-446-52770-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; entered the [[U.S. Marshals]]' [[United States Federal Witness Protection Program|Witness Protection Program]] in 1980, changed their names, and moved to undisclosed locations in [[Omaha, Nebraska]]; [[Independence, Kentucky]]; [[Redmond, Washington]]; and [[Seattle, Washington]]. In Seattle, Hill hosted backyard cookouts for his neighbors, and on one occasion, while under the influence of a combination of liquor and drugs, he revealed his true identity to his guests. To the ire of the federal marshals, they were forced to relocate him one final time to [[Sarasota]], [[Florida]]. There, a few months had passed, and Hill repeated the same breach of security, causing the government to finally expel him from the Federal Witness Protection Program.

===Hill's subsequent arrests and divorce===
Hill was arrested in 2001 on [[narcotic]]s-related charges in Seattle, where he was living in the [[Wedgwood, Seattle, Washington|Wedgwood]] neighborhood under the name of Alex Canclini.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Swanson, Brian |title=The Weird and Wacky Wedgwood Grapevine|journal=Wedgwood Echo| volume= 26| issue =1|date= January 2011|pages= 1, 7|location=Seattle, Washington}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990, his wife Karen had filed for divorce after 23 years of marriage. The divorce was finalized in 2002. Due to his numerous crimes while in witness protection, Hill (along with his wife) were expelled from the program in the early 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

After his 2001 arrest, Hill claimed to be clean until he was arrested again in [[North Platte, Nebraska]], in August 2004. Hill had left his luggage at [[Lee Bird Field]] Airport in [[North Platte, Nebraska]], containing [[drug paraphernalia]], glass tubes with cocaine and [[methamphetamine]] residue. In September 2005, he was sentenced to 180 days imprisonment for attempted methamphetamine possession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/9498067/ns/us_news-crime_and_courts/t/ex-mobster-inspiration-goodfellas-jailed/|title=Ex-mobster, inspiration for 'Goodfellas,' jailed|last=|first=|date=September 27, 2005|work=NBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hill was sentenced to four years of [[probation]] on March 26.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090326/ap_en_mo/goodfellas_arrest |title=Ex-Mobster Gets 2 Years Probation|work= Yahoo!

==Media appearances and museum inductions==
In his later years, Hill lived in [[Topanga Canyon]], approximately four miles from [[Malibu, California]], with his Italian fiancée, Lisa Caserta. Both appeared in several documentaries and made public appearances on various media programs including ''[[The Howard Stern Show]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=Howard Stern on Demand|title= Henry Hill &amp; Lisa |date=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hill, who was a frequent guest on ''[[The Howard Stern Show]]'' and had previously claimed to have never killed anyone, admitted on the show{{when|date=September 2016}} to having been ordered by Vario to kill three people, which he says he did comply with.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

In 2004, Hill was interviewed by [[Charlie Rose]] for ''[[60 Minutes]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last = Rose|first = Charlie|title = The Real Goodfella|url = http://www.cbsnews.com/video/watch/?id=6375460n|publisher = CBS|accessdate = June 17, 2012|year = 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, Hill was inducted in the [[Museum of the American Gangster]] in New York City. On June 8, 2011, a show about Hill's life aired on the [[National Geographic Channel]]'s ''[[Banged Up Abroad|Locked up Abroad]]''.

In reference to his many victims, Hill stated in an interview in March 2008, with [[BBC]]'s Heather Alexander: "I don't give a heck what those people think; I'm doing the right thing now", addressing the reporter's question about how his victims might think of his commercialization of his story through self-written books and advising on ''[[Goodfellas]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7319520.stm |title=Mafia king on the straight and narrow|work=BBC News|accessdate=March 29, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Hill was featured in episode 3 of the crime documentary series ''The Irish Mob''. In the episode, Hill recounts his life of crime, as well as his close relationship with [[Jimmy Burke (gangster)|Jimmy Burke]] and the illegal activity the two engaged in together. A large portion of the segment focuses on Burke's and Hill's involvements in the famous [[Lufthansa Heist]]. The entire series is currently available on Netflix.

In August 2011, Hill appeared in the special "Mob Week" on [[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]]; he and other former mob members talked about ''[[The Godfather]]'', ''[[Goodfellas]]'', and other such mob films,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/amcs-mob-week-features-godfather-215498|title=AMC's 'Mob Week' Features 'The Godfather,' 'Scarface' and More|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in April 2012, he was interviewed about Jimmy Burke and Tommy DeSimone, for "Mobsters", set to air that summer.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} On February 14, 2012, he was put in the Las Vegas Mob Museum.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

On October 7, 2014, Hill was featured on ESPN Films' ''[[30 for 30]]'': "Playing for the Mob". In the documentary episode, based on the [[Boston College point shaving scandal|fixing of the Boston College basketball games in 1978 and 1979]], Hill reveals the details behind the point shaving scandal along with the testimony from the players and federal investigators involved. [[Ray Liotta]] also guest starred, as the narrator.

==Restaurants==
Hill worked for a time as a [[chef]] at an Italian restaurant in Nebraska, and his spaghetti sauce, ''Sunday Gravy'', was marketed over the internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/10285652/ |author= Associated Press |title = 'Goodfella' Henry Hill says jail saved his life |accessdate = October 29, 2007 |date = December 1, 2005 |work= MSNBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hill opened another restaurant, Wiseguys, in [[West Haven, Connecticut]], in October 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.wtnh.com/Global/story.asp?S=7317253 |title=Fire hits 'Wiseguys' restaurant in West Haven |work=WTNH |accessdate=November 6, 2007 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071209192833/http://www.wtnh.com/Global/story.asp?S=7317253 |archivedate=December 9, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Artwork ==
Hill was a painter and sold his artwork on [[eBay]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://members.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewUserPage&amp;userid=mob*pop*artbyhenryhill |author=Hill, Henry |title=''Goodfella'' artwork|website=eBay.com|accessdate=October 30, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Books==
In October 2002, Hill published ''The Wiseguy Cookbook: My Favorite Recipes From My Life As a Goodfella To Cooking On the Run''. In it, Hill shared some stories throughout his childhood, life in the mob, and running from the law. He also presents recipes he learned from his family, during his years in the mob, and some that he came up with himself. For example, Hill claimed his last meal the day he was busted for drugs consisted of rolled veal cutlets, sauce with pork butt, veal shanks, ziti, and green beans with olive oil and garlic.&lt;ref&gt;

Henry Hill collaborated with the novelist [[Daniel Simone]] in writing and developing a non-fiction book titled, ''[[The Lufthansa Heist]],''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Staff |url=http://www.nypost.com/p/pagesix/cindy_adams/tyson_got_talent_BptwR8W9C9xI4m9iGLtyOK |title=Tyson's got talent &amp;#124; Page Six |publisher=Nypost.com |date=June 26, 2012 |accessdate=March 31, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; a portrayal of the famous 1978 Lufthansa Airline robbery at Kennedy Airport.

==''Goodfellas'' movie==
{{main|Goodfellas}}
''[[Goodfellas]]'', the 1990 [[Martin Scorsese]]-directed [[crime film]] adaptation of the 1986 non-fiction book ''[[Wiseguy (book)|Wiseguy]]'' by [[Nicholas Pileggi]], follows the 1955 to 1980 rise and fall of Hill and his [[Lucchese crime family]] associates. Scorsese initially named the film ''Wise Guy'' but subsequently, with Pileggi's agreement, changed the name to ''Goodfellas'' to avoid confusion with the unrelated television crime drama ''[[Wiseguy]]''. To prepare for their roles in the film, the actors often spoke with Pileggi, who shared research material he gathered while writing the book. The director made transcripts of these sessions, took the lines he liked best, and put them into a revised script the cast worked from during principal photography.

In 2006, Hill and [[Ray Liotta]] appeared in a [[photo shoot]] for ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''. At Liotta's urging, Hill entered [[alcohol rehabilitation]] two days after the shoot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,1543127,00.html |title = True Twosomes: Actors reunite with the people they play |accessdate = October 29, 2007 |author = Entertainment Weekly |date = October 6, 2006 |publisher = EW.com |quote = Published in issue #901-902 October 13, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Hill died of complications related to heart disease in a Los Angeles hospital, on June 12, 2012, after a long battle with his illness, only a day after his 69th birthday. His girlfriend for the last six years of his life, Lisa Caserta,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biography.com/people/henry-hill-9542499 |title=Henry Hill biography |publisher=Biography.com |accessdate=March 31, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; said, "He had been sick for a long time. ... his heart gave out". [[CBS News]] reported Caserta's saying: "he went out pretty peacefully, for a goodfella". She said Hill had recently suffered a heart attack before his death and died of complications after a long history of heart problems associated with smoking. Hill's family was present when he died.&lt;ref name="NYTObit"/&gt;

[[Ray Liotta]], who portrayed Hill in ''[[Goodfellas]]'', on Hill's death: "Although I played Henry Hill in the movie ''Goodfellas'', I only met him a few short times so I can't say I knew him but I do know he lived a complicated life. Liotta added: "My heart goes out to his family and may he finally rest in peace."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.tmz.com/2012/06/13/ray-liotta-henry-hill-goodfellas-dead/|title = Ray Liotta to Henry Hill &amp;ndash; R.I.P My Gangster Friend, I Hardly Knew Ye| publisher = TMZ |date = June 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hill was cremated the day after his death.

'''Ivan Stepanovich Konev''' ({{lang-ru|link=no|Ива́н Степа́нович Ко́нев}}; {{OldStyleDate|28 December|1897|16 December}}&amp;nbsp;– 21 May 1973) was a Soviet military commander who led [[Red Army]] forces on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] during [[World War II]], retook much of Eastern Europe from occupation by the [[Axis Powers]], and helped in the capture of [[Nazi Germany|Germany]]'s capital, [[Berlin]].

In 1956, as the Commander of [[Warsaw Pact]] forces, Konev led the suppression of the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Hungarian Revolution]] by Soviet armoured divisions.

==Early life==
Konev was born on 28 December 1897 into a peasant family near Podosinovets in [[Vologda Governorate]] (now [[Kirov Oblast]]). He had little formal education and worked as a [[lumberjack]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Military career==
In the spring of 1916, he was conscripted into the Imperial Russian Army. Konev was sent to the 2nd Heavy Artillery Brigade at Moscow and then graduated from artillery training courses. In 1917, he was sent to the 2nd Separate Heavy Artillery Battalion on the [[Southwestern Front (Russian Empire)|Southwestern Front]] as a junior sergeant and fought in the [[Kerensky Offensive]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

When the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]] broke out in 1917 he was demobilised and returned home, but in 1919 he joined the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Bolshevik party]] and the [[Red Army]], serving as an artilleryman. During the [[Russian Civil War]] he served with the Red Army in the Russian [[Far Eastern Republic]]. His commander at this time was [[Kliment Voroshilov]], later a close colleague of [[Joseph Stalin]] and [[Commissar]] for defence. This alliance was the key to Konev's subsequent career.

In 1926 Konev completed advanced officer training courses at the [[Frunze Military Academy]], and between then and 1931 he held a series of progressively more senior commands, becoming head of first the [[Transbaikal]] then the [[North Caucasus Military District]]s. In July 1938 he was appointed commander of the [[2nd Red Banner Army]]. In 1937 he became a Deputy of the [[Supreme Soviet]] and in 1939 a candidate member of the Party [[Central Committee]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Конев Иван Степанович|url = http://www.warheroes.ru/hero/hero.asp?Hero_id=698|website = warheroes.ru|access-date = 19 February 2016|language = Russian|trans-title = Konev Ivan Stepanovich}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===World War II===
When [[Nazi Germany]] invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941, Konev was assigned command of the [[19th Army (Soviet Union)|19th Army]] in the [[Vitebsk]] region, and waged a series of defensive battles during the Red Army's retreat, first to [[Smolensk]] and then to the approaches to Moscow.

He commanded the [[Kalinin Front]] from October 1941&lt;ref name=GeorgyZhukov&gt;{{Cite book |last=Zhukov |first=Georgy |title=Marshal of Victory, Volume II |publisher=Pen and Sword Books Ltd. |year=1974 |ISBN=9781781592915 |page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; to August 1942, playing a key role in the fighting around [[Battle of Moscow|Moscow]] and the Soviet counter-offensive during the winter of 1941–42. For his role in the successful defence of the Soviet capital, Stalin promoted Konev to Colonel-General. In the summer of 1942 Konev led the Kalinin Front and later the Western front in the [[Battle of Rzhev, Summer 1942|battle on the Rzhev salient]].&lt;ref&gt;Gerasimova, Rzhev Slaughterhouse, p. 172.&lt;/ref&gt;

Konev held "[[Front (military formation)|Front]]" (army group) commands for the rest of the war. He commanded the [[Soviet Western Front]] until February 1943, the [[North-Western Front]] February–July 1943, and the [[2nd Ukrainian Front]] from July 1943 (later further the [[1st Ukrainian Front]]) until May 1945.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

He participated in the [[Battle of Kursk]], commanding the southern part of the Soviet counter-offensive, the Steppe Front, where he was an active and energetic exponent of [[Russian military deception|maskirovka]], the use of [[military camouflage]] and [[military deception|deception]].&lt;ref name=Glantz153&gt;Glantz, 1989. P. 153.&lt;/ref&gt; Among the ''maskirovka'' measures he adopted to achieve tactical surprise were the camouflaging of defence lines and depots; dummy units and supply points; a dummy air defence network; and the use of reconnaissance units to verify the quality of his army's camouflage and deception works. In David Glantz's view, Konev's forces "generated a major portion of the element of surprise".&lt;ref name=Glantz153/&gt;

The result was that the Germans seriously underestimated the strength of the Soviet defences. The commander of 19 Panzer, [[Gustav Schmidt (general)|General G. Schmidt]], wrote that "We did not assume that there was even one fourth [of the Russian strength] of what we had to encounter".&lt;ref&gt;Glantz, 1989. Pp. 153–154.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the victory at Kursk, Konev's armies retook [[Belgorod]], [[Odessa]], [[Kharkiv]] and [[Kiev]]. The subsequent Korsun–Shevchenkovsky Offensive led to the [[Korsun–Shevchenkovsky Offensive|Battle of the Korsun–Cherkassy Pocket]] which took place from 24 January to 16 February 1944. The offensive was part of the [[Dnieper–Carpathian Offensive]]. In it, the 1st and 2nd Ukrainian Fronts, commanded, respectively, by [[Nikolai Vatutin]] and Konev, trapped German forces of [[Army Group South]] in a pocket or cauldron west of the [[Dnieper river]]. During weeks of fighting, the two Red Army Fronts tried to eradicate the pocket; the subsequent [[Korsun–Shevchenkovsky Offensive|Korsun battle]] eliminated the cauldron. According to [[Milovan Djilas]], Konev openly boasted of his killing of thousands of German prisoners of war: "The cavalry finally finished them off. 'We let the Cossacks cut up as long as they wished. They even hacked off the hands of those who raised them to surrender' the Marshal recounted with a smile."&lt;ref name="Djilas"&gt;Djilas p. 54&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Prague liberation 1945 konev.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Konev at the liberation of Prague by the Red Army in May 1945.]]
For his achievements in Ukraine, Konev was promoted by Stalin to [[Marshal of the Soviet Union]] in February 1944. He was one of Stalin's favourite generals and one of the few senior commanders whom even Stalin admired for his ruthlessness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ww2db.com/person_bio.php?person_id=35|title=Ivan Konev|last=Chen|first=Peter|date=|website=World War II Database|access-date=19 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During 1944 Konev's armies advanced from [[Ukraine]] and [[Belarus]] into [[Poland]] and later into [[Czechoslovakia]]. In May he participated in an unsuccessful invasion of the [[Balkans]], (the [[first Jassy–Kishinev Offensive]]) together with Generals [[Rodion Malinovsky]] and [[Fyodor Tolbukhin]].

By July he had advanced to the [[Vistula]] River in central Poland, and was awarded the title of [[Hero of the Soviet Union]]. In September 1944 his forces, now designated the [[4th Ukrainian Front|Fourth Ukrainian Front]], advanced into [[Slovakia]] and helped the Slovak partisans in their rebellion against German occupation.

In January 1945 Konev, together with [[Georgy Zhukov]], commanded the Soviet armies which launched [[Vistula-Oder Offensive|the massive winter offensive]] in western Poland, driving the German forces from the Vistula to the [[Oder River]]. In southern Poland his armies seized [[Kraków]]. Soviet historians, and generally Russian sources, claimed that Konev preserved Kraków from Nazi-planned destruction by ordering a lightning attack on the city.&lt;ref name=Gareev&gt;[[Makhmut Gareev]], [http://www.redstar.ru/55_yar/12_04_1.html Marshal Konev] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013152242/http://redstar.ru/55_yar/12_04_1.html |date=13 October 2007 }}, ''[[Krasnaia Zvezda]]'', 12 April 2001&lt;/ref&gt; Konev's January 1945 offensive also prevented planned destruction of the [[Silesia]]n industry by the retreating Germans.

[[File:Парад Победы на Красной площади 24 июня 1945 г. (24).jpg|thumb|left|Ivan Konev (front row, 1st from left) at the Victory Parade, June 24, 1945]]
In April his troops, together with the [[1st Belorussian Front]] under his competitor, Marshal Zhukov, forced the line of the Oder and advanced towards [[Berlin]]. Konev's forces entered the city, but Stalin gave Zhukov the honour of [[Battle of Berlin|capturing Berlin]] and hoisting the Soviet flag over the [[Reichstag (building)|Reichstag]]. Konev was ordered to the south-west, where his forces linked up with elements of the [[United States Army]] at [[Elbe Day|Torgau]] and also retook [[Prague]] shortly after the official surrender of the German forces.

===Post-war career===
[[File:Ivan S. Konev.jpg|thumb|Ivan Stepanovich Konev]]
After the war Konev was appointed head of the Soviet occupation forces in [[East Germany|Eastern Germany]] and also Allied High Commissioner for [[Austria]]. In 1946 he became commander of Soviet ground forces and First Deputy Minister of Defense of the Soviet Union, replacing Zhukov. He held these posts until 1950, when he was appointed commander of the [[Carpathian Military District]].

After Stalin's death, however, Konev returned to prominence. He became a key ally of the new Party leader, [[Nikita Khrushchev]], being entrusted with the trial of the Stalinist police chief, [[Lavrenty Beria]] in 1953. He was again appointed First Deputy Minister of Defense and commander of Soviet ground forces, posts he held until 1956, when he was named Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of the [[Warsaw Pact]]. Shortly after his appointment he led the suppression of the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Hungarian Revolution]].

He held this post until 1960, when he retired from active service. In 1961–62, however, he was recalled and was again commander of the Soviet forces in East Germany. He was then appointed to the largely ceremonial post of Inspector-General of the Defense Ministry.

Konev remained one of the Soviet Union's most admired military figures until his death in 1973. He married twice, and his daughter Nataliya is Dean of the Department of Linguistics and Literature at the [[Russian Military University]].

In 1969, the [[Minister of Defence of the Soviet Union|Ministry of Defence of the USSR]] published Konev's 285-page war memoir called ''Forty-Five''. It was later translated into English in the same year and published by Progress Publishers, Moscow. This work discusses Konev's taking of Berlin, Prague, his work with Zhukov, [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]], his field meeting with General [[Omar Bradley]] and [[Jascha Heifetz]]. In English, the book was titled ''I. Konev&amp;nbsp;– Year of Victory''. It was also published in Spanish and French under the titles ''El Año 45'' and ''L'an 45'' respectively.

[[Marshal of the Soviet Union]], [[Hero of the Soviet Union|Twice Hero of the Soviet Union]], holder of the [[Order of Victory]] Ivan Stepanovich Konev was buried in the [[Kremlin Wall Necropolis|Kremlin Wall]] with the greatest figures of the USSR, and can still be visited today.

On 9 January 1991, his memorial sculpture in Kraków was dismantled. The sculpture was given to the Russian town of Kirovsk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|language=Polish|title=9 stycznia 1991 r. Pomnik marszałka Iwana Koniewa wywieziony z Krakowa|url=http://nowahistoria.interia.pl/kartka-z-kalendarza/news-9-stycznia-1991-r-pomnik-marszalka-iwana-koniewa-wywieziony-,nId,1086142|date=9 January 2014|publisher=Interia}}&lt;/ref&gt; The memorial plaque in front of the apartment building where he lived (three blocks from the [[Kremlin]]) is still mounted on the brick wall.

==Monuments==
Konev has monuments in [[Prague]], [[Svidník]], [[Kharkov]], [[Patriot Park]] ([[Moscow]] region), [[Kirov, Kirov Oblast|Kirov]], [[Belgorod]], [[Nizhny Novgorod]], [[Omsk]], and [[Vologda]].

The Konev monument in Prague became a subject of controversy that escalated in 2018, after which the city administration added explanatory text to the monument, noting the participation of its subject in the suppression of the Hungarian Revolution and the Prague Spring.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://zpravy.aktualne.cz/domaci/u-sochy-marsala-koneva-odhalili-vysvetlujici-desky-prepisuje/r~6408ca48a55011e8b634ac1f6b220ee8/?redirected=1536168691|title=U sochy maršála Koněva odhalili vysvětlující desky.

'''Jean-Bernard Restout''' (22 February 1732 – 18 July 1797) was a French painter.

==Life==
Restout was born and died in Paris.  A son of [[Jean II Restout]] and like him a member of the [[Académie des sciences, belles-lettres et arts de Rouen|Académie de Rouen]], he won the [[Prix de Rome]] in 1758 and was aggregated to the [[Académie royale de peinture et de sculpture|Académie royale]] on his return from Italy in 1765, then received into it in 1769. However, he refused to conform to its rules led to a quarrel. He frequently exhibited at the [[Salon de Paris]] from 1767 to 1791. On the [[French Revolution]], he was president of the Commune des Arts which campaigned, with its founder [[Jacques-Louis David|David]], for the suppression of the [[Académie royale de peinture et de sculpture|Académie]]. Made guardian of the [[Hôtel de la Marine|Garde-Meuble royal]] by [[Jean Marie Roland|Roland]] during the Revolution, this favour nearly cost him his life during the [[Reign of Terror]] when Roland and his friends were implicated in the after of the theft from the Garde-Meuble. Suspected, he was imprisoned and only released on the fall of [[Maximilien de Robespierre|Robespierre]] on [[9 Thermidor]].

'''Jessica Thom''' (born 14 July 1980) is a British theatre-maker and comedian best known for Touretteshero, an alter-ego and project aimed at increasing awareness of [[Tourette syndrome|Tourette's Syndrome,]] the neurological condition which she was diagnosed with in her early twenties.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2014/jul/09/jess-thom-tourettes-hero-comedy|title=Jess Thom AKA Touretteshero: comedy at its most unpredictable|last=Caird|first=Jo|date=2014-07-09|newspaper=The Guardian|access-date=2017-02-21|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first Touretteshero production, ''Backstage in Biscuit Land'' debuted at [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe|Edinburgh Fringe Festival]] in 2014. The show won critical acclaim and has since toured across the UK and internationally, including various performances across North America&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.britishcouncil.us/tourettesheros-backstage-biscuit-land|title=Touretteshero's Backstage in Biscuit Land {{!}} British Council|website=www.britishcouncil.us|language=en|access-date=2017-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.festival.melbourne/2016/events/backstage-in-biscuit-land/|title=Backstage in Biscuit Land {{!}} Melbourne Festival, 06—23 October 2016.|newspaper=Melbourne Festival|access-date=2017-02-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thom has also made numerous appearances on British television, notably an interview on ''[[Russell Howard's Good News|Russel Howard's Good News]]'' which has garnered more than 400,000 YouTube views&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Russell Howard's Good News|title=Russell speaks to real life hero Jess Thom|date=2015-10-30|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8gOcbneQRQ|accessdate=2017-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2017|February|lc=y}}, and was reported on by ''[[The Independent]]'' and ''[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]]'' newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://metro.co.uk/2015/10/31/biscuits-this-woman-explains-living-with-tourettes-in-hilarious-and-heart-warming-interview-on-russell-howards-good-news-5473598/|title=This woman explains living with Tourette's in funny and heart-warming interview|last=Metro.co.uk|first=Katie Baillie for|date=2015-10-31|website=Metro|access-date=2017-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.indy100.com/article/this-russell-howard-interview-destigmatising-tourettes-is-very-very-funny--WJm3Q1NF_e|title=This Russell Howard interview destigmatising Tourettes is wickedly|date=2015-10-31|newspaper=indy100|access-date=2017-02-21|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early/personal life ==
Thom was born in London. She experienced involuntary vocal and physical tics throughout her childhood as a result of Tourette's Syndrome, but was not diagnosed with the condition until her early twenties.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Thom has recurring vocal tics, the most common of which is the word 'biscuit' which she can utter up to 16,000 times a day.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/oct/18/backstage-in-biscuit-land-review-tourettes-makes-for-unpredictable-joyous-must-watch-theatre|title=Backstage in Biscuit Land review – Tourette's makes for unpredictable, joyous, must-watch theatre|last=Harmon|first=Steph|date=2016-10-18|newspaper=The Guardian|access-date=2017-02-21|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has a younger sister, who Jess previously referred to as 'Fat Sister' in a vocal tic whilst she was dieting. Thom acknowledges that her condition presents challenges but seeks to avoid 'self-pity or mockery' and to 'celebrate the creativity and humour of Tourette's'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.touretteshero.com/faq/|title=FAQ|newspaper=Touretteshero|access-date=2017-02-21|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to guidance notes for journalists written by the team at Touretteshero, and published by the Guardian:&lt;blockquote&gt;Although some aspects of [Tourette's Syndrome] are challenging, Jess does not describe herself as a 'Tourette's sufferer' under any circumstances. Instead she likes to be referred to as a 'person with Tourette's' or as simply as 'having Tourette's'. She is 'brave' for all sorts of reasons, but not because she is disabled.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/feb/29/challenging-stereotypes-about-tourette-syndrome|title=Challenging stereotypes about Tourette syndrome|date=2016-02-29|newspaper=The Guardian|access-date=2017-02-21|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Thom has stated that she finds herself talking about and explaining Tourette's everyday in her day-to-day interactions: "It doesn't always feel like a choice, more a tool for living...Often this is very functional, like explaining at the start of a phone call that I have Tourettes, answering a question or addressing sniggers on public transport."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://exeuntmagazine.com/features/reclaiming-cultural-spaces-a-dialogue/|title=Reclaiming Cultural Spaces: A Dialogue - Exeunt Magazine|website=exeuntmagazine.com|access-date=2017-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thom regularly experiences discrimination as a result of having Tourette's. She has recounted one particularly bad experience in multiple interviews, when she went to see comedian [[Mark Thomas]] perform at Tricycle Theatre.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/aug/09/backstage-in-biscuit-land-edinburgh-festival-2014-review-tourettes|title=Edinburgh festival 2014 review: Backstage in Biscuit Land – Tourette's and theatre make a joyous combo|last=Gardner|first=Lyn|date=2014-08-09|newspaper=The Guardian|access-date=2017-02-22|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other audience members complained about the noise she was making as a result of her vocal tics and the venue's staff asked her to move into a sound booth, so she wouldn't be heard by other customers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Although initially the experience made her vow never to go to the theatre again, it eventually became the catalyst for her becoming a performer: "The creative way to respond was to occupy that space as an artist".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=British Council Arts|title=Jess Thom on accessibility and Dublin Theatre Festival 2016 (audio described)|date=2017-01-25|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHKQJ_V2lLs|accessdate=2017-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thom is also a wheelchair user. Following the [[social model of disability]], Thom sees most of the challenges she faces not as a result of her unique neurology and physical impairment, but as a result of the 'disabling barriers' created by society, telling BBC News in 2014: "My wheelchair and my tics are not the thing that disables me; the thing that disables me is the inaccessible environment".&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Citation|last=BBC News|title=What is freedom? Jess Thom, 'Touretteshero' - BBC News|date=2014-03-03|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Rqft1YfDDk|accessdate=2017-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thom studied at the [[Royal College of Art]], London, graduating in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-modern/performance-and-music/jess-thom-touretteshero|title=Jess Thom: Touretteshero - Performance at Tate Modern {{!}} Tate|last=Tate|website=Tate|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==

=== Early career ===

Prior to becoming a theatre-maker and performer, Thom's career began as a playworker, working with children and young people. She has also been a fundraiser and project coordinator at a charity based in south London.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Touretteshero ===

In 2010, Thom and longstanding friend and collaborator Matthew Pountney co-founded Touretteshero.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.touretteshero.com/about/|title=About Touretteshero|newspaper=Touretteshero|access-date=2017-02-22|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea started out as a way of engaging people with the creative and humorous side of Tourette's, with Thom dressing up in a superhero costume and delivering performances and workshops, especially to children and young people. In 2011, Thom appeared on Episode 3, 'Uses and Abuses' of [[Stephen Fry]]'s five-part BBC series [[Fry's Planet Word]], to discuss her Tourette's and [[coprolalia]] - the involuntary use of swear words which 10% of people with Tourette's experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Touretteshero|title=Fry's Planet Word - Touretteshero|date=2011-10-18|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOwPaBDFDi4|accessdate=2017-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01614w9|title=Uses and Abuses, Fry's Planet Word - BBC Two|website=BBC|access-date=2017-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, Souvenir Press published ''Welcome to Biscuit Land: A year in the life of Touretteshero'' based on entries on Thom's blog, for which Fry wrote the foreword.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Welcome-Biscuit-Land-year-Touretteshero-ebook/dp/B009K19DL2/ref=sr_1_2?s=digital-text&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1487761070&amp;sr=1-2|title=Welcome to Biscuit Land: A year in the life of Touretteshero|last=Thom|first=Jessica|last2=Fry|first2=Mrs Stephen|date=2012-09-29|publisher=Souvenir Press|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; Touretteshero has also put on creative events, like 'We Forgot The Lot!' - a collaboration with [[Tate]] for children and young people with and without Tourette's.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-britain/special-event/we-forgot-lot|title=We forgot the lot! - Special Event at Tate Britain {{!}} Tate|last=Tate|website=Tate|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Backstage in Biscuit Land ===

Partly inspired by her negative experience of attending the Mark Thomas gig, and taking its name from Thom's most common vocal tic 'biscuit', ''Backstage in Biscuit Land'' began development as a theatre piece which explores the creative opportunities of Thom's tics and also other people's reaction to them. In 2013, Thom met performer and puppeteer, Jess Mabel Jones at a performance of ''Beauty and the Beast'' by ONEOFUS ([[Mat Fraser]] and [[Julie Atlas Muz]]) in London.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Mabel Jones would later become a lead collaborator on ''Backstage in Biscuit Land''. Mabel Jones's role in this 'one-woman show for two' is to make sure Thom doesn't stray too far off topic.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Due to Thom's unique and sporadic ticcing, which is riffed on heavily in the show, no two performances are quite the same. The set for the show features 50 items that were the subjects of some of Thom's spontaneous vocal tics during the development cycle, including a 'babygrow for Les Dennis' and 'ducks dressed as pterodactyls'.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

''Backstage in Biscuit Land'' received R&amp;D funding from commissioning body Unlimited,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://weareunlimited.org.uk/commission/touretteshero/|title=Touretteshero - Unlimited|newspaper=Unlimited|access-date=2017-02-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; but crowdfunding was sought to help bring the show to Edinburgh Fringe Festival.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Reviews of the initial run at Edinburgh were very positive. Lyn Gardiner in ''The Guardian'' said: "Jess Thom's condition lends her show an absurdist edge Samuel Beckett would be proud of...Tourette's and theatre make a joyous combo". She also described it as "extraordinarily entertaining" awarding it four stars.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Alice Jones in ''The Independent'' said: "The humour is black but it's also daft and uplifting, and in places, impossibly moving".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/edinburgh-festival/backstage-in-biscuit-land-pleasance-courtyard-review-remarkable-tourettes-inspired-comedy-9651503.html|title=Backstage in Biscuit Land, Pleasance Courtyard, review: Remarkable|date=2014-08-06|newspaper=The Independent|access-date=2017-02-22|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; TV Bomb, were perhaps most effusive with their praise declaring: "There are more ideas and imagination in this one hour show than most of the Fringe programme combined," awarding it 5 out of 5.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.tvbomb.co.uk/review/backstage-in-biscuit-land/|title=Review: Backstage in Biscuit Land: Pleasance Courtyard: Edinburgh: 5 Bombs|newspaper=TV Bomb {{!}} Reviews and Opinion|access-date=2017-02-22|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following its success at Edinburgh, ''Backstage in Biscuit Land'' went on a tour across the UK throughout 2015 and 2016 including a notable performance at the [[Barbican Centre|Barbican]], London. It continued to pick up glowing reviews with ''The Stage'' awarding it four stars and calling the show "a properly joyous thing, funny, informative, and eloquent about the need for theatre to be more accessible to everyone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/2015/backstage-biscuit-land-review-barbican-pit-celebratory-show/|title=Backstage in Biscuit Land review at Barbican Pit – 'a celebratory show' {{!}} Review {{!}} Theatre {{!}} The Stage|newspaper=The Stage|access-date=2017-02-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Broadway Baby also awarded the show 4 stars "This show is one big tasty biscuit all right".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://broadwaybaby.com/shows/backstage-in-biscuit-land/706927|title=Backstage in Biscuit Land|website=Broadway Baby|language=en-gb|access-date=2017-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in 2016 the production went international with a tour of North America which included performances at New York's BRIC, Toronto's Harbourfront, San Francisco's International Arts Festival and Los Angeles' Skirball Cultural Center. Performances in Australia included at the Sydney Opera House,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sydneyoperahouse.com/whatson/kath17-backstage-in-biscuit-land.aspx|title=BACKSTAGE IN BISCUIT LAND|website=Sydney Opera House|language=en|access-date=2017-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Queensland Performing Arts Centre, Brisbane and Melbourne International Festival. The performance at the latter earned the show 4 stars in the Australian edition of ''The Guardian,'' with Steph Harmon describing at as "unpredictable, joyous, must-watch theatre".&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

In September of that year, Thom delivered a talk about the misconceptions of Tourette's Syndrome at TEDxAlbertopolis, the first [[TED (conference)|TED]] event to take place at London's [[Royal Albert Hall]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ted.com/tedx/events/7663|title=TEDxAlbertopolis {{!}} TED.com|website=www.ted.com|language=en|access-date=2017-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following her appearance on Fry's Planet Word in 2014, Thom appeared on Radio 4's [[Today (BBC Radio 4)|The Today Programme]], discussing Tourette's and [[BBC News]] discussing her ideas about 'freedom' later that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/today/hi/today/newsid_9714000/9714435.stm|title=BBC News - Today - My Tourette's tics are really funny|website=news.bbc.co.uk|access-date=2017-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In October 2015, Thom was interviewed on BBC's ''[[Russell Howard's Good News|Russel Howard's Good News]],'' with the broadcast apparently reaching some 3 million people.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://disabilityarts.online/magazine/opinion/jess-thom-on-taking-biscuit-land-to-the-small-screen/|title=Jess Thom on taking Biscuit Land to the small screen - Disability Arts Online|newspaper=Disability Arts Online|access-date=2017-02-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next month a version of ''Backstage in Biscuit Land'', adapted for television entitled ''Broadcast from Biscuit Land'' had a 30-minute slot on BBC4's Live from Television Centre, the first live broadcast from Television Centre since the building was decommissioned in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2015/tvc-theatre|title=BBC - BBC announces return to Television Centre for live theatre broadcast - Media Centre|website=www.bbc.co.uk|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, Thom appeared on series 10 of Richard Herring's Leicester Square Theatre Podcast.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.comedy.co.uk/podcasts/richard_herring_lst_podcast/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Awards ==

==  Disability Activism ==
Thom is an outspoken advocate of disabled people's rights. Her personal outlook often inverts the typical negative stereotypes associated with disability, for instance she sees her Tourette's as a source of creativity and her wheelchair as a symbol of freedom.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; She advocates for empowerment of disabled people via the social model of disability, telling Exeunt: &lt;blockquote&gt;As a society there are still lots of people who think about disability solely in negative terms. The medical model – 'disabled people are broken and need to be fixed' – and the charity model – 'tragic and in need of help' – are ways of conceptualizing disability that remain widespread even though the social model of disability – 'people are disabled by a failure to consider difference' – underpins our legislation and public services.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Following her own negative experiences of attending the theatre, Thom has campaigned to get more 'relaxed performances' (a performance where the audience are allowed to make noise and move around, which is more suitable for certain neurodiverse people) in theatres, as well as making every performance of ''Backstage in Biscuit Land'' a relaxed performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/la-et-cm-relaxed-performance-20160530-snap-story.html|title=The theater world is opening its arms to people with Tourette's and autism|last=Greiving|first=Tim|website=latimes.com|access-date=2017-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thom has also been an outspoken critic of the [[Government of the United Kingdom|UK Government]]'s cuts to provision for disabled people, telling Disability Arts Online:&lt;blockquote&gt;So many of the structures that were in place to support disabled people to live independent lives have been dismantled in recent years. Ambitions are being capped because of the structures designed to disable and limit what we have access to. There is a big difference between having basic needs met and having the right to an independent life. With the abolition of the Independent Living Fund and Access to Work and all the other attacks on disabled peoples' rights our only option is to keep fighting.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Johann Wilhelm Löbell''' (15 September 1786 – 12 July 1863) was a German [[historian]].

==Biography==
Löbell was a native of [[Berlin]]. He studied at the Universities of [[University of Heidelberg|Heidelberg]] and [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Berlin]] under [[Friedrich August Wolf|Wolf]] and [[Philipp August Böckh|Böckh]]. He had entered the scholarly life against the wishes of his mother who wanted him to go into business.&lt;ref name=adb&gt;{{Cite ADB|19|35|38|Löbell, Johann Wilhelm|Franz Xaver von Wegele|ADB:Loebell, Johann Wilhelm}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[War of the Sixth Coalition]] (1812–14), he served as a volunteer in a ''[[Landwehr]]'' installation. He was not on the frontlines but worked in a supporting office.&lt;ref name=adb/&gt;

In 1814 he moved to [[Breslau]], where he soon found work as a teacher in a war college. There he published a historical paper and another one on building connections between the sciences and humanities in gymnasium studies. In 1823, he went to work in Berlin at a military academy as a history teacher.&lt;ref name="adb"/&gt; There he also became involved with the issuance of new editions of [[Karl Friedrich Becker]]'s "''Weltgeschichte''" (World history). He eventually oversaw the issuance of three new editions. During this time period he was friends to [[Henrich Steffens]] (1773-1845) and [[Friedrich von Raumer]] (1781-1873).

In 1829 he became an associate professor of history at the [[University of Bonn]], where two years later he became a full professor. Among the works he wrote at Bonn were "''Gregor von Tours und seine Zeit''" ([[Gregory of Tours]] and his times, 1839), a revision of Becker's "''Weltgeschichte''" (1836–38), "''Weltgeschichte in Umrissen und Ausführungen''" (World history outlined and explained Part I, 1846), "''Die Entwicklung der deutschen Poesie von Klopstocks erstem Auftreten bis zu Goethes Tode''" (The development of German poetry from [[Klopstock]] until [[Goethe]]'s death, 1856–65), and "''Historische Briefe''" (Letters on history, 1861), an anonymous attack on [[Ultramontanism]].

==Legacy==
Löbell's large personal library is now kept in a school library at the Bielefeld ''Ratsgymnasium'', and is property of the city of [[Bielefeld]].

'''Sir John Harvey-Jones''' [[Order of the British Empire|MBE]] (16 April 1924&amp;nbsp;– 9 January 2008) was an English businessman. He was the chairman of [[Imperial Chemical Industries]] from 1982 to 1987. He was best known by the public for his [[BBC television]] show, ''Troubleshooter'', in which he advised struggling businesses.

==Early life==
John Henry Harvey-Jones&lt;ref name ="odnb"&gt;Geoffrey Owen, 'Jones, Sir John Henry Harvey- (1924–2008)', ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, Jan 2012 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/99963, accessed 11 Feb 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; was born in [[London Borough of Hackney|Hackney]], London, but spent most of his early childhood in [[Dhar]], [[India]], where his father was a guardian to a teenage [[maharajah]]. He was shipped back to Britain at age six to attend a [[Preparatory school (UK)|prep school]] at [[Deal, Kent|Deal]], [[Kent]]. He entered [[Britannia Royal Naval College|Dartmouth Royal Naval College]] at age 13.

==Royal Navy career==
Harvey-Jones joined Dartmouth Royal Naval College as a cadet in 1937, and in 1940, at the age of 16, he joined [[HMS Diomede (D92)|HMS ''Diomede'']] as a midshipman. The next two ships that he served with, [[HMS Ithuriel (H05)|HMS ''Ithuriel'']] and [[HMS Quentin (G78)|HMS ''Quentin'']], were sunk by enemy action. Harvey-Jones went on to join the [[Royal Navy Submarine Service|submarine service]] in 1942, and received his first command at age 24.

With the end of [[World War II]], Harvey-Jones went to the [[University of Cambridge]] to learn [[Russian language|Russian]] in six months and joined [[Naval Intelligence Division|Naval Intelligence]] as an [[Interpreting|interpreter]]. He married Mary Bignell in 1947,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://icwales.icnetwork.co.uk/business-in-wales/business-news/2008/01/12/from-bullying-to-the-top-of-industry-91466-20342758/ |title=From bullying to the top of industry |publisher=icWales |date=12 January 2008 |accessdate=15 January 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080118035703/http://icwales.icnetwork.co.uk/business-in-wales/business-news/2008/01/12/from-bullying-to-the-top-of-industry-91466-20342758/ |archivedate=18 January 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and he commanded the Russian intelligence section under the guise of the "[[British Baltic Fishery Protection Service]]", which used two ex-German [[E-boat]]s for gathering clandestine intelligence on the [[Soviet Baltic Fleet]]. Rising to the rank of [[lieutenant-commander]], Harvey-Jones was awarded a military [[Member of the Order of the British Empire|MBE]] in 1952 for his work in Naval Intelligence, although his citation stated that the award was for "fishery protection duties in the Baltic".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Elliott and Shukman |first= Geoffrey and Harold |title= Secret Classrooms: An Untold Story of the Cold War |year= 2002|publisher= Samovar|isbn=1-903608-13-9 |page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commercial career==

===Imperial Chemical Industries===
Refused permission by the [[Royal Navy]] to spend more time with his wife and daughter Gaby, who had contracted [[Poliomyelitis|polio]], he resigned his commission in 1956 and joined [[Imperial Chemical Industries]] (ICI) on [[Teesside]] as a junior training manager. In 1973, at age 49, he was promoted to sit on the main board of directors. In April 1982, he became chairman of ICI, only the second split-career man and non-chemist to reach the top.

Mentored in part by [[John Adair (Leadership Guru)|John Adair]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leadership-studies.com/research/viewabs.asp?id=68 University of Exeter (website accessed 22 March 2007)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070416145940/http://www.leadership-studies.com/research/viewabs.asp?id=68 |date=16 April 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Harvey-Jones saw his responsibilities to both [[stockholder]]s and employees as "making a profit out of the markets where the market is". He maintained a firm belief in "speed rather than direction", on the assumption that "once travelling a company can veer and [[tack (sailing)|tack]] towards the ultimate objective." Thus, at the business level he cut non-profit making and what he saw as non-core businesses, so that at board level he could concentrate on putting more power in fewer hands "to reduce the number of those who can say 'no' and increase the motivation of those who can say 'yes'", maintaining that "there are no bad troops, only bad leaders". After only 30 months in the job, having cut the UK workforce by one third, he had doubled the price of ICI shares and turned a loss into a one billion pound profit.

===Media career===
According to one newspaper, it was the [[British Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]]'s ''[[Troubleshooter (TV series)|Troubleshooter]]'' series, first broadcast in 1990, that made Harvey-Jones the most famous industrialist since [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/6285160.stm|title=Obituary: Sir John Harvey-Jones|publisher=BBC News|date=11 January 2008|accessdate=18 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.birminghampost.co.uk/business/manufacturing/former-city-lawyer-digby-jones-6939901|title=Former city lawyer Digby Jones debuts as BBC's Troubleshooter|publisher=Birmingham Post|author=Roz Laws|date=10 April 2014|accessdate=18 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--not sure which paper, implies a TV critic--&gt; It ran to five series and several specials in the 1990s and also won him a [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTA]] award. His advice was at times controversial – in particular he was critical of the [[Morgan Motor Company]], which some argue was vindicated, as it is still trading successfully today.

===Other positions===
In 1989, he became chairman of ''[[The Economist]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Obituary: John Harvey-Jones | work = The Economist | date = 19 January 2008 | page = 94}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a non-executive director of [[Grand Metropolitan]] plc (now part of [[Diageo]]), and honorary vice-president of the Institute of Marketing.

Harvey-Jones was also chairman of the Burns-Anderson Group plc, a conglomerate spanning merchant banking, financial services, recruitment, marketing and business services, and stockbroking.

Between 1986 and 1991, Harvey-Jones served as the second [[Chancellor (education)|Chancellor]] of the [[University of Bradford]]. A commemorative painting exists in the University of Bradford collection,&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120723104605/http://www.cornucopia.org.uk/html/search/verb/GetRecord/8716 University of Bradford portraits at Cornucopia]&lt;/ref&gt; and Harvey-Jones also agreed to sit for sculptor [[Jon Edgar]] for a terracotta portrait at Clyro in July 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jonedgar.co.uk/artwork/harvey-jones/ Picture of bust at Jon Edgar web site]&lt;/ref&gt;

He was chairman of the [[Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust]] and member of the Advisory Council of the [[Prince's Trust]]. In 2001, he became the president of the [[Multiple Sclerosis Trust|MS Trust]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mstrust.org.uk/information/opendoor/articles/0802_03.jsp|title=Sir John Harvey-Jones 1924–2008 |publisher=[[Multiple Sclerosis Trust|MS Trust]]|date=February 2008|accessdate=15 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Described by ''[[The Guardian]]'' as one of the best-known British advocates of [[Transcendental Meditation technique|Transcendental Meditation]], Harvey-Jones said, "I don't make a drama out of a crisis. If I gave it up now, my wife would leave me."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Honigsbaum|first=Mark|title=All you need is love and peace|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2005/aug/15/health.healthandwellbeing|work=The Guardian|accessdate=13 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having lived most of his post-retirement period in [[Ross-on-Wye]], he died in his sleep after a long illness, aged 83, at the [[Hereford County Hospital]].

Evangelista is primarily known for being the longtime [[muse]] of photographer [[Steven Meisel]],&lt;ref name=madonna&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gross|first1=Michael|title=Madonna's Magician|journal=New York Magazine|date=October 12, 1992|page=30|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oOQCAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA30|accessdate=April 25, 2016|publisher=New York Media, LLC|issn=0028-7369}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hotshot&gt;{{cite news|last1=La Ferla|first1=Ruth|title=Fashion; Hot Shot|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/07/07/magazine/fashion-hot-shot.html|accessdate=April 14, 2015|work=The New York Times|date=July 7, 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as for coining the phrase "We don't wake up for less than $10,000 a day." She holds the record for her multiple appearances on the cover of ''[[Vogue Italia]]'', all of which were photographed by Meisel.

Evangelista's modeling career began in 1984 when she signed with [[Elite Model Management]] after having moved from her native Canada to New York City. Upon the suggestion of photographer [[Peter Lindbergh]], Evangelista had her hair cut short in 1988. The haircut, nicknamed "The Linda", not only sparked many copies worldwide, but it also benefited Evangelista's career and helped usher in the era of the supermodel.

Described as the "chameleon" of the fashion industry,&lt;ref name=cigar&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rothstein|first1=Mervyn|title=Evangelista!|url=http://www.cigaraficionado.com/webfeatures/show/id/Evangelista_7670|accessdate=May 19, 2015|work=Cigar Aficionado|date=Autumn 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as a key figure among the five supermodels, Evangelista was one of the most famous women in the world during the late 1980s and throughout the 1990s.&lt;ref name=fashionable&gt;{{cite news|last1=Helmore|first1=Edward|title=The Fashionable One; in the Supermodel Era, Linda Evangelista Was the Fashion World's Favourite, and She Can Still Turn It on If the Cause Is Right. but What Gets Her out of Bed Now, Asks Edward Helmore|url=https://www.questia.com/newspaper/1G1-136572361/the-fashionable-one-in-the-supermodel-era-linda#/|accessdate=April 29, 2015|work=The Evening Standard|date=September 23, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike her colleagues, she chose not to diversify into other ventures outside of modeling. She retired from her career in 1998 and made a comeback three years later, this time working only sporadically. Her achievements as a model led to her being voted as "The Greatest Supermodel of All Time" by the viewers of the television show ''[[Fashion File]]'' in 2008.

In late June 2011, Evangelista filed court papers that revealed her son was fathered by billionaire Frenchman [[François-Henri Pinault]], who by then was the husband of actress [[Salma Hayek]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Italiano|first1=Laura|title=Salma Hayek's hubby fathered Linda Evangelista's son|url=https://nypost.com/2011/07/01/salma-hayeks-hubby-fathered-linda-evangelistas-son/#ixzz1Qv6zociT|work=New York Post|date=July 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Baker|first1=K.C.|last2=Shira|first2=Dahvi|title=Salma Hayek's Husband, François-Henri Pinault, Is the Father of Linda Evangelista's Son|url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20507623,00.html|work=People|date=July 1, 2011|accessdate=May 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and who Evangelista had dated for four months in late 2005 and early 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lee|first1=Esther|title=Luxury group CEO François-Henri Pinault faces model Linda Evangelista in court|url=http://www.philly.com/philly/blogs/hautehouse_row/Luxury-group-CEO-Francois-Henri-Pinault-to-face-model-Linda-Evangelista-in-court.html|accessdate=January 21, 2018|work=The Philadelphia Inquirer|date=May 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; After several court appearances aimed at establishing a child-support agreement, on August 1, 2011, Evangelista formally filed for a child support order in Manhattan Family Court, seeking $46,000 in monthly child support from Pinault.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sternberg|first1=Louis|title=Factors in Calculating Child Support – Linda Evangelista seeking $46,000 per month|url=http://www.louislsternberglaw.com/2011/08/02/factors-in-calculating-child-support-linda-evangelista-seeking-46000-per-month-2/|website=Suffolkdivorcelawyer.com|date=August 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was reported that if granted, this amount "would probably be the largest support order in the history of the family court".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Schwartz|first1=Alison|title=Linda Evangelista Wants $46,000 in Monthly Child Support: Report|url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20514995,00.html|work=People|date=August 2, 2011|accessdate=May 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A heavily publicized&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fisher|first1=Luchina|title=Linda Evangelista Settles Child Custody Case|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/linda-evangelista-settles-child-custody-case/story?id=16296433#.T6WLu45y9JM|website=ABCnews.com|date=May 7, 2012|accessdate=May 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; child support trial began on May 3, 2012,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Italiano|first1=Laura|title=Pinault and Evangelista child-support trial begins|url=http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/pinault_and_evangelista_due_in_court_X29zVJItzZlhM9280XZLtJ|work=New York Post|date=May 3, 2012|accessdate=May 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and included testimony from both Pinault and Evangelista, with Evangelista's attorney claiming that Pinault had never supported the child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Linda Evangelista testifies at NYC child-support trial|url=http://www.ctv.ca/CTVNews/Entertainment/20120504/evangelista-child-support-120504/|website=CTVnews.ca|date=May 4, 2012|accessdate=May 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sternberg|first1=Louis|title=Linda Evangelista's Right to Child Support Prior to Petitioning|url=http://www.louislsternberglaw.com/2012/05/03/linda-evangelistas-child-support-prior-petitioning/|website=Suffolkdivorcelawyer.com|date=May 3, 2012|accessdate=May 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several days into the trial, on May 7, 2012, Evangelista and Pinault reached an out-of-court settlement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fleeman|first1=Mike|title=Linda Evangelista Settles Child-Support Case|url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20593472,00.html|work=People|date=May 4, 2012|accessdate=May 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This page is a '''List of people related to Quranic verses''':

==Ahl al-Bayt==
The [[Ahl al-Bayt]] was Muhammads household. Shi'a and Sunni have differing views regarding who is included among them, and also different views regarding which verses are associated with the household.

===Generally===

====3:61====
{{See also|Hadith of Mubahela}}
&lt;blockquote&gt;''And whoso disputeth with thee concerning him, after the knowledge which hath come unto thee, say (unto him): Come! We will summon our sons and your sons, and our women and your women, and ourselves and yourselves, then we will pray humbly (to our Lord) and (solemnly) invoke the curse of Allah upon those who lie.''{{cite quran|3|61}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to [[hadith]] collections, in 631 an [[Arab Christians|Arab Christian]] envoy from [[Najran]] (currently in northern [[Yemen]] and partly in [[Saudi Arabia]]) came to Muhammad to argue which of the two parties erred in its doctrine concerning [[Jesus]]. After likening Jesus' miraculous birth to Adam's creation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|3|59|style = ref}}&lt;/ref&gt; Muhammad called them to ''mubahala'' (cursing), where each party should ask God to destroy the lying party and their families.&lt;ref name="cite quran|3|61|style = ref"&gt;{{cite quran|3|61|style = ref}}&lt;/ref&gt; Muhammad, to prove to them that he is a prophet, brought his daughter Fatimah and his surviving grandchildren, [[Hasan ibn Ali]] and [[Husayn ibn Ali]], and Ali ibn Abi Talib and came back to the Christians and said this is my family and covered himself and his family with a cloak.&lt;ref&gt;See:* [[Sahih Muslim]], Chapter of virtues of companions, section of virtues of Ali, 1980 Edition Pub. in Saudi Arabia, Arabic version, v4, p1871, the end of tradition #32
* Sahih al-Tirmidhi, v5, p654
* Madelung, 1997, pp. 15 and 16
&lt;/ref&gt; [[Allameh Tabatabaei]] explains in ''[[Tafsir al-Mizan]]'' that the word "Our selves" in this verse&lt;ref name="cite quran|3|61|style = ref"/&gt; refers to Muhammad and Ali. Then he narrates [[Imam Ali al-Rida]], eighth [[Twelve Imams|Shia Imam]], in discussion with [[Al-Ma'mun]], [[Abbasid]] [[caliph]], referred to this verse to prove the superiority of Muhammad's progeny over the rest of the [[Ummah|Muslim community]], and considered it as the proof for Ali's right for caliphate due to Allah made Ali like the self of Muhammad.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.almizan.org/Tafseer/Volume6/6Imran2.asp Tabatabaei, Tafsir al-Mizan, v.6, Al Imran, verses 61-63] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090814141005/http://almizan.org/Tafseer/Volume6/6Imran2.asp |date=2009-08-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====33:33====
{{main|Ahl al-Bayt|The verse of purification}}
{{See also|Hadith of The Cloak|Hadith of the Twelve Successors}}

Surah Al-Ahzaab, Ayah 33:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"...Verily, Allah has decreed to remove fault from you, O' Ahlul Bayt, and sanctify you in a perfect way."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Sunni view: "No! It's taken out of context, it's only talking about the wives of the Prophet!"

Firstly, it is important to note that nowhere in this Ayah are the wives of Muhammad mentioned.

Surah Al-Ahzaab, Full Ayah 33:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Stay in your houses and do not display your finery with the display of the former [days of] ignorance. Maintain the prayer and pay the zakat and obey Allah and His Apostle. Verily, Allah has decreed to remove fault from you, O' Ahlul Bayt, and sanctify you in a perfect way."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Each [[Ayah]] is an individual sign of Allah:
"Ayah or Aayah is the Arabic word for evidence or sign:

"These are the Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, revelations, etc.) of Allah, which We recite to you (O Muhammad) with truth. Then in which speech after Allah and His Ayat will they believe?" (Surah Al-Jathiya 45:6)

Secondly, this Ayah uses the words Ankum (from you) and Yutahhirakum (to purify you), which are both in the masculine plural form. Though it is known that in Arabic Masculine is unisex, there is a problem saying that since the fact that the previous sentence in reference to the wives used only feminine verbs and pronouns, while this sentences uses masculine. The feminine for the above would be Ankunna and Yutahhirakunna. The sudden change in grammatical gender reference means that it is not about the wives. Similar use of switching subjects after Ayahs are found all throughout the Quran. A great example of this is Surah Haqqah, which does so in nearly every Ayah.

Thirdly, Muhammad said explicitly that wives are not part of Ahlul Bayt:

Sahih Muslim, one of the three most authentic collections in the Sunnah.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Sahih Muslim #31:5920-2:
"Hussain Ibn Sabrah asked Zaid Ibn Arqam, "Who are the members of His household? Aren't His wives part of the members of his family?" Thereupon Zaid said, "His wives are members of his family [in a general sense], but (Islamically), the members of his family are those for whom acceptance of zakat is forbidden." Hussain asked, "Who are they?". Upon which Zaid said, "Ali and the offspring of Ali, Aqil and the offspring of Aqil, the offspring of Jaffer, and the offspring of Abbas." Hussain said "These are those for whom the acceptance of zakat is forbidden?" Zaid replied, "Yes."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Sahih Muslim, Zaid then expanded on this hadith and stated this:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Hussain Then asked: "Aren't the wives (Of the Prophet) included amongst the members of the household?" He said, "No, by Allah, a woman lives with a man [as his wife] for a certain period; he then divorces her, and she goes back to her parents and her people. The members of his household include his own self, and his kith, and kin, for whom the acceptance of zakat is prohibited."
- Sahih Muslim #31:5923&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===[[Ali ibn Abu Talib]]===
{{main|Ali in the Quran}}
Before Shia &amp; Sunni Ali is the one of Alh al-Bayt.
Ali is the fourth Sunni Caliph and first Shia Imam.

====2.207====
&lt;blockquote&gt;''And among men is he who sells his ''[[nafs]]'' (self) in exchange for the pleasure of [[Allah]]''{{cite quran|2|207}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 622, the year of Muhammad's migration to Yathrib (now Medina), Ali risked his life by sleeping in Muhammad's bed to impersonate him and thwart an assassination plot, so that Muhammad could escape in safety.&lt;ref name="Britannica"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Nasr |first=Seyyed Hossein | authorlink=Seyyed Hossein Nasr | title=Qur’an |year=2007| encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica Online | accessdate=2007-11-04|location=|publisher=|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-68890/Quran}}

According to some [[hadith]], a verse was revealed about Ali concerning his sacrifice on the night of Hijra which says, "&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.almizan.org/Tafseer/Volume3/Baqarah50.asp Tabatabae, Tafsir Al-Mizan] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011223853/http://almizan.org/Tafseer/Volume3/Baqarah50.asp |date=2007-10-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====5.3====
&lt;blockquote&gt;''Today I have perfected your religion, and completed my favours for you and chosen Islam as a religion for you.''{{cite quran|5|3}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to [[Sunni]] [[Tafsir]] this verse was delivered in [[Farewell Pilgrimage]]&lt;ref name="EoI-Muhammad"&gt;Alford Welch, ''Muhammad'', [[Encyclopedia of Islam]]&lt;/ref&gt; while according to [[Shia]] ones it refers to appointment of [[Ali|Ali ibn Abi Talib]] as [[Succession to Muhammad|the successor of Muhammad]] in [[Hadith of the pond of Khumm|pond of Khumm]] which happened while Muslims returned from Mecca to Medina, few days later.&lt;ref&gt;See:

====5.55====
&lt;blockquote&gt;''Only [[Allah]] is your [[Wali]] (guardian) and [[Mohammad|His Apostle]] and those who believe, maintain the prayer and give the [[zakāt]] while [[Ruku'|bowing]].''{{cite quran|5|55}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It is unanimous among only Shia that this verse refers to Ali ibn Abi Talib and was revealed after he had given his ring away to someone in need who had entered the mosque while [[Salat|prayer]] was in progress.&lt;ref name="Musnad Ahmad Ibn Hanbal"&gt;Musnad Ahmad Ibn Hanbal, p.38&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tafsir al-Kashaf"&gt;Tafsir al-Kashaf, Al-Zamakhshari, p.505, 649&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tafsir al-Kabir"&gt;Tafsir al-Kabir, Ahmad Ibn Muhammad al-Tha'labi&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tafsir al-Kabir"&gt;Tafsir al-Kabir, Ibn Jarir al-Tabari, p.186, 288-289&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tafsir Jamiul Hukam al-Quran,"&gt;Tafsir Jamiul Hukam al-Quran, Muhammad Ibn Ahmad Qurtubi, p.219&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tafsir al-Khazin"&gt;Tafsir al-Khazin, p.68&lt;/ref&gt;

====13.7====
&lt;blockquote&gt;And the Unbelievers say: "Why is not a sign sent down to him from his Lord?" But thou art truly a warner, and to every people a guide. {{cite quran|13|7}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Some Shia sources claim that when this verse was revealed when [[Mohammad]] said "I'm the warner and the guide and through you will be guided those who are to be guided."&lt;ref name="Momen17"&gt;Momen (1985), p.17&lt;/ref&gt;

==[[Muhammad's wives]]==

===[[Khadija bint Khuwaylid|Khadija]]===

Khadija was Muhammad's first wife. She was a businesswoman and Muhammad was her employee. Muhammad did not marry a second wife until after she died, an event which Muhammad greatly mourned. Muhammad was 50 years old when Khadija died.

===[[Hafsa]]===

These Ayahs are talking to Hafsa and Aisha, two of Muhammad's wives who disclose secret of Muhammad .

Surah at-Tahrim, Ayahs 3-5:

&lt;blockquote&gt;3"And when the Prophet (blessings and peace be upon him) secretly disclosed a matter to one of his wives, but when she mentioned it and Allah made it known to the Prophet (blessings and peace be upon him), then the Prophet reminded her of some part of it and overlooked (to inform) the rest of it. Then when the Prophet (blessings and peace be upon him) informed her of it (that she had disclosed that secret), she said: ‘Who has told you of that?’ The Prophet (blessings and peace be upon him) said: ‘The All-Knowing, All-Aware (Lord) has told me.’
.
4. If you both turn to Allah in repentance, (that is better for you) because the hearts of both of you have inclined (towards the same), but if you help one another in this matter (that may annoy the Holy Prophet [blessings and peace be upon him]). So surely Allah is the One Who is his Friend and Helper and Jibril (Gabriel) and the most pious believers and after them (all) angels too are (his) helpers.

 If he divorces you, then it may well be that your Lord will give him in your place better wives than yourselves (who) will be obedient, true believers, submissive, penitent, worshippers, given to fasting, (some) formerly married and (some) virgins."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===[[Zaynab bint Jahsh]]===

Zaynab was married to [[Zayd ibn Harithah]] until they divorced and she married Muhammad.

====33:36====

:''is not fitting for a Believer, man or woman, when a matter has been decided by Allah and His Messenger to have any option about their decision: if any one disobeys Allah and His Messenger, he is indeed on a clearly wrong Path.

===[[Sawda bint Zama]]===

===={{Quran-usc|4|127}}====
:''And they ask you a decision about women. Say: God makes known to you His decision concerning them, and that which is recited to you in the Book concerning female orphans whom you do not give what is appointed for them while you desire to marry them, and concerning the weak among children, and that you should deal towards orphans with equity; and whatever good you do, God surely knows it.

This verse is also taken to mean that abundance of riches and progeny has made you forgetful till you reached the graves, but the utterance of Amir al-mu'minin supports the first meaning."''

'''Manuel Ignacio Santa Cruz Loidi''' ({{lang-eu|Manuel Santa Krutz}}) (1842-1926) was a [[Spanish people|Spanish]] [[Roman Catholicism|Roman-Catholic]] [[priest]]. For some 35 years he served on apostolic mission in [[Colombia]], where he was heading a parish in rural interior of the [[Pasto, Colombia|Pasto province]]; for some 15 years he held also various minor posts in [[Jamaica]]. He is best known, however, for his activity in 1872-1873, when he commanded a [[Carlist]] [[guerilla]] unit during the [[Third Carlist War|civil war]] in [[Spain]]. As "cura Santa Cruz" (priest Santa Cruz) or simply as "El Cura" (The Priest) he gained notoriety for cruelty and in the Spanish public discourse of the late 19th century he became a symbol of savage brutality. In this role – though also with a grade of ambiguity - he featured as a protagonist in a few great works of Spanish [[Modernist literature|Modernist]] literature of the early 20th century and became a mythical figure long before his own death.

==Family and youth==
[[File:Vista de la localidad de Elduaien (1 de 1) - Fondo Marín-Kutxa Fototeka.jpg|thumb|left|[[Elduain]]]]
Manuel Santa Cruz Loidi was descendant to [[Basque people|Basque]] rural working class families; generations of his ancestors were farmers living in the [[Oria (river)|Oria river]] valley, in the [[Gipuzkoa|Gipuzkoan]] county of [[Tolosa, Spain|Tolosa]]. His paternal grandfather [[Pascual de Santa Cru]]z was a native of [[Andoain|Andoain]] yet he settled in [[Elduain]], probably on the economy of his wife María Bautista Sarove. Their son and the father of Manuel Ignacio, [[Francisco Antonio Santa Cruz Sarove]] (1784-1842), in 1824 married Juana Josefa Loidi Urrestarazu (1803-1871); she was the daughter of Miguel Ignacio Loidi, a native of [[Amezketa]], and María Ignacia Urrestarazu, who originated from [[Orendain]].&lt;ref&gt;Juan de Olazabal y Ramery, ''El Cura Santa Cruz Guerrillero'', San Sebastián 1979, p. 71, referred after  Iñigo Pérez de Rada Cavanilles, ''La Partida del Cura Santa Cruz y su Bandera'', [in:] ''Noticias Carlistas'' service, 16.06.2011, available
 [http://noticiascarlistas.blogspot.com/2011/06/la-partida-del-cura-santa-cruz-y-su.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; The couple lived in Elduain; their [[Baserri|caserio]], known as Zamonea, was among the poorer ones in the village.&lt;ref&gt; Gaëtan Bernoville, ''La cruz sangrienta. Historia del cura Santa Cruz'', Tafalla 2000, {{ISBN|848136181X}}, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; It is not clear how many children they had, though according to some sources Manuel Ignacio was not their only child and he had at least one sister.&lt;ref&gt; unknown by name, a sister of Manuel Santa Cruz was reportedly a protagonist of one of his wartime episodes, exchanged for a Liberal official&lt;/ref&gt; Following the death of her husband María Ignacia re-married with a widower Juan Ignacio Betelu Muñagorri (1795-1861); it is not clear whether they had any offspring.&lt;ref&gt; Pérez de Rada Cavanilles 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Manuel was raised by his mother and [[step-father]] and initially did not differ from other village boys. It is not clear where he was first educated; at some stage he was taken care of by his much older paternal cousin, a local priest Francisco Antonio Sasiain Santa Cruz (1812-1898); he taught the teenager [[Latin-language|Latin]] and apparently directed him towards the religious career.&lt;ref&gt; according to some sources Francisco Antonio Sasiain Santa Cruz was the uncle of Manuel Santa Cruz, Bernoville 2000, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed in 1861 Manuel entered the [[seminary]] in [[Vitoria-Gasteiz|Vitoria]]; during the first 3 years he was obtaining high grades and was rewarded with the ''meritissimus'' title; later his performance worsened, reportedly due to health problems.&lt;ref&gt; Bernoville 2000, p.  20&lt;/ref&gt; He was ordained as a priest in 1866 and posted to [[Hernialde]], a village few miles from his native one. According to some sources he was first nominated a [[coadjutor]],&lt;ref&gt;Pérez de Rada Cavanilles 2011&lt;/ref&gt; other authors claim he initially acted as a [[vicar]].&lt;ref&gt; Bernoville 2000, p.  20&lt;/ref&gt; Following death of the [[parish priest]] it was Santa Cruz who became his successor at unspecified time in the late 1860s; he allegedly assumed his duties with frenetic energy and as a spiritual shepherd he tended to rigidity, himself adhering to an austere living pattern.

Since his father had served as a Carlist volunteer during the [[First Carlist War|last civil war]]&lt;ref&gt;Pérez de Rada Cavanilles 2011&lt;/ref&gt; and since legitimist sympathies prevailed among the rural Gipuzkoan folk&lt;ref&gt; compare e.g. the Basque folk rhymes, gathered in Antoni Zavala (ed.), ''Karlisten Bigarren Gerrateko bertsoak'', Oiartzun 1997, {{ISBN|8489080585}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is likely that Manuel from his youth was growing in an ambience strongly flavored with Carlism.&lt;ref&gt; Bernoville 2000, pp.  17-20&lt;/ref&gt; His position was probably strengthened during the seminar years, as Carlism was popular also among the lower and regular clergy of the province.&lt;ref&gt; Basque and Navarrese seminars and religious orders of the time are considered "foco de integrismo religioso", Iñaki Anasagasti, ''El cura Santa Cruz'', [in:] ''Ianasagasti'' blog service, available [http://ianasagasti.blogs.com/mi_blog/2017/04/el-cura-santa-cruz.html here], see also Juan Cruz Labeaga Mendiola, ''Memorias de exilio de un clérigo carlista (1858-1869)'', [in:] ''Príncipe de Viana'' 59 (1998), p.829&lt;/ref&gt; In line with [[Traditionalism (Spain)|Traditionalist]] outlook Santa Cruz assumed a decisively hostile stand towards the [[Glorious Revolution (Spain)|1868 revolution]], from behind the pulpit lambasting the new regime as an ungodly depraved system.&lt;ref&gt; Bernoville 2000, p.  27&lt;/ref&gt; His inflammatory sermons gained him attention of the authorities; in October 1870 a [[Guardia Civil|Guardia Civi]]l patrol&lt;ref&gt; details of the episode differ; some authors claim there were just two civiles, see e.g. Bernoville 2000, p. 27; other maintain there were some 20-30 officials deployed to detain Santa Cruz, Roman Oyarzun, ''La historia del carlismo'', Madrid 1969, p. 331&lt;/ref&gt; showed up in Hernialde to detain him after a Sunday mass. Santa Cruz took advantage of somewhat loose approach of his captors and fled, in few days crossing to France.&lt;ref&gt; the escape served as the first in a long string of anecdotes which used to build the later Santa Cruz’ legend. When approached by the civiles by the end of the mass Santa Cruz asked whether he could have breakfast and suggested that they have some chocolate with him. As they declined Santa Cruz led them to the clergy house and left both at the ground floor, going upstair allegedly to change. He then jumped out of the first floor window, Bernoville 2000, pp.  27-28&lt;/ref&gt;

==Guerilla leader==
[[File:Carlist guerilla 1873.jpg|thumb|left|Santa Cruz and his men, 1873]]
Following some 18 months on exile in [[Bayonne]]&lt;ref&gt; Juantxo Egaña, ''Las imágenes de Ladislas Konarzewski'', [in:] ''juantxoegaña'' service 31.12.09, available [http://juantxoegana.blogspot.com/search?q=cura+santa+cruz here] &lt;/ref&gt; in 1872-1873 Santa Cruz was taking part in the guerilla warfare prior and during the [[Third Carlist War]]. His record falls into 4 separate strings: from April till May 1872,&lt;ref&gt;when the unit of his commander Recondo surrendered in May 1872 Santa Cruzed refused to follow suit and fled&lt;/ref&gt; from June till August 1872,&lt;ref&gt;in August 1872 he was captured by governmental troops; he managed to escape from a building in Aramaio he was held at from the balcony and then spent many hours (numbers given vary up to "the whole day") under a bridge in the ice-cold river, for long periods all under water and breathing with a straw; he then made it to the French border. Except the Enderlaza carnage the Aramaio episode is probably the best-known chapter of Santa Cruz' wartime history and the key one building his myth. For one of the accounts see Bernoville 2000, pp. 45-49&lt;/ref&gt; from December 1872 till July 1873&lt;ref&gt;the first half of 1873 was the climax of Santa Cruz' activity, with some 20 belligerent episodes noted between January and June; he decided to abandon arms under pressure from the Carlist high command&lt;/ref&gt; and in December 1873,&lt;ref&gt;following few idle months in the French Pyrenees Santa Cruz gave in to the pressure of his men and returned to arms, but December 1873 was pretty uneventful and following another showdown with Lizarraga ended with the last and ultimate withdrawal into France&lt;/ref&gt; all separated by periods of taking refuge in France. Initially he joined a unit led by a Carlist veteran Pedro Recondo; serving as a [[chaplain]], Santa Cruz was gaining experience in rural irregular tactics. Since the summer of 1872 he was leading his own troops; initially the group consisted of some 15–25 men, but later it grew and in literature is estimated at 200,&lt;ref&gt;''Narración militar de la guerra carlista de 1869 à 1876'', Madrid 1883, p. 370&lt;/ref&gt; 500 or even 1,000, with an informal in-between command structure built up. The detachment was rather loosely incorporated into the Carlist war effort; at early stages it was assigned a vague task of "guarding the Northern borderline" by the legitimist [[general staff]], yet it seems that the unit retained great autonomy and operated independently.

In military terms the activity of Santa Cruz’ unit consisted of harassing the enemy logistics network and raiding minor garrisons.&lt;ref&gt;according to a contemporary historian the unit of Santa Cruz "was among the most efficient ones" when it comes to sabotage actions, Jose Andres-Gallego (ed.), ''Historia general de España y América'' vol. XVI/2, Madrid 1981, {{ISBN|8432121142}}, p. 253&lt;/ref&gt; The former included disrupting postal service,&lt;ref&gt;by ambushes against postal stagecoaches or destroying postal stations&lt;/ref&gt; arms transports&lt;ref&gt;e.g. on August 6, 1872 Santa Cruz and his unit ambushed an arms transport from Mondragón, seizing some 50 Berdan and Remington rifles, see ''Narración militar de la guerra carlista de 1869 à 1876'', Madrid 1883, p. 202&lt;/ref&gt; or railway connections;&lt;ref&gt;the unit of Santa Cruz was derailing trains and demolishing railway terminals, e.g. on January 18, 1873 the Santa Cruz unit attacked the railway station in Hernani and burnt it down &lt;/ref&gt; the latter included descending upon smaller locations&lt;ref&gt;e.g. in June 1872 he took control of [[Azcoitia]] or in February 1873 he raided [[Deba, Gipuzkoa|Deva]]&lt;/ref&gt; and destroying archives, pillaging [[Guardia Civil]] or [[Carabineros]] posts, abducting local officials and staging shows of prowess. The Liberal high command was forced to diminish their frontline strength and to assign more troops to vigilance and patrol duties. However, in line with his guerilla strategy Santa Cruz avoided open confrontation against enemy forces; cases of accepting a battle usually resulted in defeat, e.g. in [[Aia]].&lt;ref&gt;for detailed though apparently biased acoount, which portrays the Aia episode as a treason on part of Lizarraga, see Bernovilla 2000, pp. 69-79&lt;/ref&gt; When facing enemy roundup Santa Cruz used to disband his group and to set re-assembly terms; taking advantage of perfect familiarity with the mountainous Gipuzkoan countryside and support of the local population, he kept evading the governmental chase. Santa Cruz operated across all the province of Gipuzkoa, though he was noted also in neighboring areas of [[Biscay (province)|Biscay]],&lt;ref&gt;e.g. in August 1872 Santa Cruz operated in the region of [[Arrazola]],  Iñaki Anasagasti, ''Algunas peripecias del cura Santa Cruz'', [in:] ''Ianasagasti'' blog service, available [http://ianasagasti.blogs.com/mi_blog/2012/10/algunas-peripecias-del-cura-santa-cruz.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Álava]] and particularly [[Navarre]].&lt;ref&gt;in the Navarrese town of Vera de Bidasoa he set up one of his headquarters&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Enderlaza 2016.jpg|thumb|Enderlaza, 2016]]
Since early 1873 Santa Cruz gained notoriety for cruelty and was charged with committing acts of barbarity.&lt;ref&gt;his unit sported a "guerra sin cuartel" ("no-mercy war") banner with skull and bones insignia&lt;/ref&gt; They consisted of executions of prisoners,&lt;ref&gt;tha case which caused particular outrage was abduction and later execution of a mayor of Anoeta, Anjel Rekalde, ''Dorregarai: la casa torre'', Tafalla 1992, {{ISBN|9788486597511}}, p. 110&lt;/ref&gt; including women&lt;ref&gt;allegedly Santa Cruz twice spared a woman he charged with spying; when detained for the third time, she was eventually executed, Bernoville 2000, p. 88&lt;/ref&gt; or members of his own unit when suspected of treason, burning down settlements or administering corporal punishment.&lt;ref&gt;in later literature he was charged with ordering humiliating sanctions, also against females, see e.g. references in ''Gerifaltes de antaño'' by Ramón Valle-Inclan or ''Zalacain el aventurero'' by Pio Baroja, who suggest that Santa Cruz used to subject women to [[tarring and feathering]]; however, the information is not confirmed in scientific historiography&lt;/ref&gt; The episode which caused particular outrage occurred in June 1873, when santacrucistas assaulted a fortified provincial border control post in Endarlaza.&lt;ref&gt;for the best account available see Mikelatz , ''Los Fusilamientos de Endarlaza: Crónica de un Desastre Anunciado'', [in:] ''Hechos, Anécdotas y Relatos de Las Guerras Carlistas'' service 10.12.16, available [http://mikelatz.blogspot.com/2016/12/los-fusilamientos-de-endarlaza-cronica.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; Claiming that during the shootout the defenders had mischievously displayed a white flag to fire at the approaching Carlists later on, Santa Cruz had his men execute 35 carabineros who had ultimately surrendered. The Carlist high command was continuously uneasy about Santa Cruz;&lt;ref&gt;the Carlist general staff was getting perplexed by activity of Santa Cruz for a number of reasons. His independent military actions might have triggered moves of large Liberal troops which in turn might have caught regular Carlist units by surprise. Brutality of El Cura damaged reputation of the claimant, especially that he posed as representative of godly law and order. Still worse, Santa Cruz undermined the credibility of Carlist high command; they have concluded deals with local railway companies and Santa Cruz’s actions against the infrastructure, like derailing trains or burning terminals, was causing trouble&lt;/ref&gt; the Enderlaza episode proved to be the last straw.&lt;ref&gt;Jordi Canal, ''El carlismo'', Madrid 2000, {{ISBN|8420639478}}, p. 180&lt;/ref&gt; The local legitimist commander general Antonio Lizarraga, who was trying to bring Santa Cruz in line for some time, demanded that the insubordinate priest backs down. Eventually Santa Cruz found himself hunted down by the Liberals and the Carlists alike; he disbanded his unit and withdrew into France.&lt;ref&gt;Santa Cruz does not elicit much interest from present-day historians. For a brief and unbiased recent account of his wartime deeds and later reception by a professional historian see Canal 2000, pp. 179-182. The latest larger study on Santa Cruz, Vicente Garmendia, ''Memorias levemente apocrifas del cura Santa Cruz'', San Sebastian 2007, {{ISBN|9788497972345}}, is basically focused on dismantling the myth of Santa Cruz&lt;/ref&gt;

In France Santa Cruz seemed disoriented and with no direction;&lt;ref&gt; Bernoville 2000, p. 145&lt;/ref&gt; he spent more than a year mostly in small villages in the [[French Basque country]].&lt;ref&gt; Santa Cruz was hosted either by former members of his unit or by his acquaintances, Bernoville 2000, pp. 145-146&lt;/ref&gt; Some of his former men suggested resumption of warfare, though Lizarraga confirmed that in such case he would be persecuted.&lt;ref&gt; Bernoville 2000, pp. 146-147&lt;/ref&gt; The Madrid government filed a request for extradition, turned down by the French.&lt;ref&gt; ''La Correspondencia de España'' 19.07.23, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=7146612&amp;interno=S&amp;posicion=4&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; [[National Gendarmerie|Gendarmarie]] kept a close watch on him and at one point Santa Cruz was detained in [[Bayonne]];&lt;ref&gt; Bernoville 2000, p. 148&lt;/ref&gt; he was pressed to leave the country. In late 1874 or early 1875 he found himself in the [[Jesuit]] college in [[Lille]]; thanks to support of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Cambrai|Cambrai archbishop]] [[:fr:René-François Régnier|René-François Régnier]] Santa Cruz’s plea for clemency was accepted in the [[Holy See|Vatican]] and he was reinstated to regular religious duty,&lt;ref&gt; Bernoville 2000, pp. 148-149&lt;/ref&gt; abandoned during the wartime years.&lt;ref&gt; when leading the guerilla unit Santa Cruz did not conduct regular religious service; there was another chaplain in his unit, who was taking care of sermons, confessions, funerals etc.&lt;/ref&gt; He intended to commence [[Christian mission|missionary service]];&lt;ref&gt; according to later accounts of his guerilla subordinates already in 1874 Santa Cruz declared he was no longer a military commander but rather a missionary, and took some preparatory steps for would-be service in [[Americas|America]], Bernoville 2000, pp. 146-147&lt;/ref&gt; as part of preparation scheme the Jesuits directed him to their establishment in [[Great Britain|Britain]], where Santa Cruz was to learn [[English language|English]]. In early 1876 he met his king [[Carlos, Duke of Madrid|Carlos VII]] in [[London]] but accounts differ;&lt;ref&gt;for an ambiguous account see Julio de Urquijo, ''La Cruz de Sangre. El Cura Santa Cruz, pequeña rectificación histórica'', San Sebastián 1928, pp. 61-62, referred after Pérez de Rada Cavanilles 2011&lt;/ref&gt; according to some Santa Cruz defended his wartime record,&lt;ref&gt; Bernoville 2000, p. 150&lt;/ref&gt; according to others he regretted his conduct and begged for mercy.&lt;ref&gt;during the London meeting Carlos VII, who during the war authorised orders against Santa Cruz and called him a traitor, pardoned Santa Cruz, [[Francisco Martín Melgar y Rodríguez|Francisco Melgar]], ''Veinte años con Don Carlos. Memorias de su secretario'', Madrid 1940, p. 83, similar account in [[Manuel Polo y Peyrolon]], ''D. Carlos de Borbón y de Austria-Easte'', Valencia 1909, p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly afterwards he sailed to [[Jamaica]].&lt;ref&gt; one source claims also that his trip was made possible by donation of "a pious English lady", Bernoville 2000, p. 150&lt;/ref&gt; The Catholic administration of the island since the 1840s has been dominated by the English Jesuit province and since the 1860s their activity was on the rise;&lt;ref&gt; in 1866 there were 4,110 Catholics in Jamaica, two thirds of them in Kingston, Kathryn Wirtenberger, ''The Jesuits in Jamaica'' [MA thesis Loyola University], Chicago 1942, p. 66&lt;/ref&gt; Santa Cruz was dispatched in a group of 3 priests.&lt;ref&gt; Francis J.

[[File:Cane cutters in Jamaica.jpg|thumb|160px|[[Cane (grass)|cane]] cutters, Jamaica]]
Upon crossing the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] Santa Cruz abandoned the first surname and started using only his maternal one; hence, in America he became known as Manuel Loidi. In December 1876 he was first recorded as performing religious service in Jamaica;&lt;ref&gt; ''Roman Catholic Baptisms 1876'', [in:] ''Jamaican Family Search Genealogy'' service, available  [http://www.jamaicanfamilysearch.com/Members/c/Cb76d-j.htm here] &lt;/ref&gt; he was later to serve in the parishes of [[Saint Andrew Parish, Jamaica|St. Andrews]], [[Portland Parish|Portland]] and [[Saint Mary Parish, Jamaica|St. Mary]], all located in the Eastern part of the island.&lt;ref&gt; ''Handbook of Jamaica 1891-1892, The Church of England and Roman Catholics'', [in:] ''Jamaican Family Search Genealogy'' service, available [http://www.jamaicanfamilysearch.com/Members/h/hclergy1.htm here]; a religious identified as "E. Loidi" is almost certainly Santa Cruz, as at that time there were no more than 10 Catholic religious on the island&lt;/ref&gt; His exact position in the religious structure is not clear; in documentation available he is listed as "clergyman";&lt;ref&gt; ''The Church of England and Roman Catholics'', [in:] ''Jamaican Family Search Genealogy'' service, available [http://www.jamaicanfamilysearch.com/Members/h/hclergy1.htm here]&lt;/ref&gt; until the early 1880s he is recorded usually as administering baptisms,&lt;ref&gt; see ''Baptisms'' section, ''Roman Catholic Baptisms (A-J). King’s Weston'', [in:] ''Jamaican Family Search Genealogy'' service, available [http://www.jamaicanfamilysearch.com/Members/c/Cbweston_a-j.htm here]&lt;/ref&gt; marriages&lt;ref&gt; see ''Marriages'' section, ''Roman Catholic Baptisms (K-Y). King’s Weston'', [in:] ''Jamaican Family Search Genealogy'' service, available [http://www.jamaicanfamilysearch.com/Members/c/Cbweston_k-y.htm here] &lt;/ref&gt; and especially funerals,&lt;ref&gt; ''Roman Catholic Burials'', [in:] ''Jamaican Family Search Genealogy'' service, available [http://www.jamaicanfamilysearch.com/Members/c/Cbu17j-y.htm here] &lt;/ref&gt; mostly though not exclusively in the location of King’s Weston. At one point or another he served in 5 different mission stations and himself founded the other nine.&lt;ref&gt; Bernoville 2000, p. 150&lt;/ref&gt; Today he is particularly noted for his work in the small Preston Hill village, one of the first Catholic congregations outside [[Kingston, Jamaica|Kingston]]&lt;ref&gt; Wirtenberger 1942, p. 63&lt;/ref&gt; and inhabited mostly by descendants of the Castle Mine slaves. Santa Cruz is credited for construction of a wooden St. Francis Xavier church, which served the faithful for decades.&lt;ref&gt; Michael Burke, ''500 Years of Christianity in Jamaica'', [in:] ''Jamaica Observer'' 26.04.12, available [http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/columns/500-years-of-christianity-in-jamaica_11339616 here]&lt;/ref&gt; It seems that Santa Cruz and the Jamaica Jesuits lived in extreme poverty, as destitute and barren local Catholic community was hardly in position to support them.&lt;ref&gt; in 1887 one Jesuit missionary noted: "We are all as poor as can be. Once in the country a piece of honeycomb was sent in for my breakfast, with a request that I would return the wax. Very few of them own beds; they sleep on a mat on the ground”, Wirtenberger 1942, p. 91; others mention that Santa Cruz lived in "austeridad", "rigidez" and lack of "cualquier clase de comodidad", Bernoville 2000, p. 150&lt;/ref&gt; It is not clear why Santa Cruz abandoned Jamaica in 1891 or 1892; it is likely that his leaving the island was related to change in missionary administration, as in the early 1890s the Jamaica mission was allotted to the [[Maryland]]-[[New York City|New York]] Jesuit province and soon the US Jesuits took over.&lt;ref&gt; Wirtenberger 1942, p. 92&lt;/ref&gt;

==Colombia==
[[File:Panoramica Pasto volcan galeras.JPG|thumb|left|[[Pasto]], present view]]
It is not clear in what circumstances Santa Cruz moved to Colombia; one version is that the option was suggested and facilitated by an anonymous influential Spanish Jesuit and a friend of him.&lt;ref&gt; Bernoville 2000, p. 151&lt;/ref&gt; Santa Cruz was agreed to join Colegio Javieriano,&lt;ref&gt; though the Jesuit college in Pasto existed since 1772, it opened a secondary school module in 1885, see ''Historia'', [in:] ''Colegio Javierano'' web service, available [http://www.javeriano.edu.co/index.php/institucional-2/historia/ here]&lt;/ref&gt; which served as a Jesuit college and a seminary in [[Pasto]], a capital of [[Nariño Department|Nariño department]]. He arrived in the city in 1892, possibly having spent some time in [[Panama]] earlier.&lt;ref&gt; Francisco Celis Alban, ''De terrorista a santo'', [in:] ''El Tiempo'' 14.12.2003, available [http://www.eltiempo.com/archivo/documento/MAM-1049478 here]&lt;/ref&gt; In the college he was teaching English, French, Latin,&lt;ref&gt; Celis Alban 2003&lt;/ref&gt; geography and math;&lt;ref&gt; Bernoville 2000, p. 152&lt;/ref&gt; his worn-out [[cassock]] and a long beard made him look like a beggar.&lt;ref&gt; Isidoro Medina Patiño, ''Don Manuel: el temible cura guerrillero'', Bogota 2005, {{ISBN|9789583372285}}, referred after Celis Alban 2003&lt;/ref&gt; He was not member of the Jesuit order; his request for admission was turned down, reportedly because his wartime deeds required a long penitence period. Santa Cruz was allowed to enter the monastery and to follow the rules, but his formal admission was adjourned until an unspecified later date.&lt;ref&gt; Bernoville 2000, p. 151&lt;/ref&gt;

Santa Cruz taught in Pasto at least until 1898.&lt;ref&gt; Bernoville 2000, p. 152&lt;/ref&gt; The following year Colombia was torn by a [[Thousand Days' War|Thousand Days’ War]], with Pasto turned into a Conservative stronghold dominated by personalities of [[Ezequiél Moreno y Díaz|Ezequiel Moreno Díaz]] and [[:es:Pedro Schumacher Niessen|Pedro Schumacher]], two hardline bishops.&lt;ref&gt; Celis Alban 2003&lt;/ref&gt; According to a Colombian historian both hierarchs approached Santa Cruz, who was known for uncompromising anti-[[Liberalism|liberal]] sermons. Santa Cruz was reportedly asked to lead operations against the Liberal insurgents, yet he declined. However, he apparently agreed to assist in some kind of staff work, offering his advice in terms of planning and strategy; in this role he turned very successful.&lt;ref&gt; Celis Alban 2003&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Cura Santa Cruz a caballo.png|thumb|160px|Santa Cruz in Colombia]]
Following the ultimate Conservative victory in 1902 Santa Cruz founded a village of San Ignacio,&lt;ref&gt; ''La Compañia de Jesús en Pasto, 1599-1985'', Pasto 1985, p. 155&lt;/ref&gt; located in the [[Andes]] some 20 km north of Pasto in the county of [[Buesaco]];&lt;ref&gt; Iñaki Anasagasti, ''El aporte vasco contemporáneo en Colombia'', [in:] ''Ianasagasti'' blog service, available [http://ianasagasti.blogs.com/mi_blog/2018/03/el-aporte-vasco-contempor%C3%A1neo-en-colombia.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; for the second time since the Hernialde spell he assumed the role of a [[parson]]. The hamlet was inhabited by extremely poor indigenous population; it seems that apart from providing spiritual service, Santa Cruz tried to support it economically. Teaching the locals agriculture, he travelled across the county begging, with the money collected dedicated to needs of the San Ignacio natives.&lt;ref&gt; Celis Alban 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Santa Cruz spent some 18 uneventful years in San Ignacio&lt;ref&gt; it is not clear whether Santa Cruz resided permanently in San Ignacio or whether he used to come to the village on Fridays, his arrival announced by a small trumpet he kept since his Gipuzkoan wartime years, ''Páginas escolares'' 264 (1927), p. 4, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=1000002540&amp;interno=S&amp;presentacion=pagina&amp;posicion=4 here]&lt;/ref&gt; and according to some sources was greatly respected among the locals for his apostolic work but also for his personal humility and exemplary life;&lt;ref&gt; ''Una fundación colombiana reivindica la vida de entrega del Cura Santa Cruz, guerrillero vasco del XIX que vivió durante más de tres décadas en Colombia'', [in:] ''Euskalkultura'' service 30.12.2003, available [http://www.euskalkultura.com/espanol/noticias/una-fundacion-colombiana-reivindica-la-vida-de-entrega-del-cura-santa-cruz-guerrillero-vasco-del-xix-que-vivio-durante-mas-de-tres-decadas-en-colombia-1 here]&lt;/ref&gt; his most lasting achievement was construction of the local San Ignacio church.&lt;ref&gt; ''Campaña para recuperar capilla de Cura Santa Cruz Loydi'', [in:] ''YouTube service'', available [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6jZgOPuBi0 here]&lt;/ref&gt;

Santa Cruz retained his reactionary ultra-conservative outlook; during local electoral campaigns he used to instruct his flock how to dodge the corrupted election system and vote the candidates he considered right.&lt;ref&gt; Gustavo Jiménez Cadena, ''Es buen negocio vender su voto?'' [in:] ''Ecos de Pasto 740 KHz'' service, available [http://www.emisoraecosdepasto740.com/11-noticias/162-es-buen-negocio-vender-su-voto here]&lt;/ref&gt; It seems that he also remained a Carlist; he corresponded with his oldtime war comrades back in Spain&lt;ref&gt; Bernoville 2000, p. 153&lt;/ref&gt; and in a separate letter pledged loyalty to [[Jaime, Duke of Madrid|Don Jaime]],&lt;ref&gt; Juan María Roma (ed.), ''Album histórico del carlismo'', Barcelona 1933, p. 241&lt;/ref&gt; though there are suggestions he also recognized [[Alfonso XIII of Spain|Don Alfonso]].&lt;ref&gt; ''Páginas escolares'' 264 (1927), p. 4, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=1000002540&amp;interno=S&amp;presentacion=pagina&amp;posicion=4 here]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1920 he was eventually admitted to the Jesuit [[novitiate]] and in 1922 he formally entered the order.&lt;ref&gt; Bernoville 2000, p. 154&lt;/ref&gt; It is not clear where Santa Cruz spent his senility; in the Pasto monastery or in San Ignacio, where he was eventually buried in the church he constructed.&lt;ref&gt;slightly other dates are provided in Martin Ugalde Orradre, ''Nueva Síntesis de la historia del pueblo vasco'', Donostia 2010, {{ISBN|9788498432312}}; the author claims that Santa Cruz worked on mission in Colombia  from 1891 (not 1892) till 1922, when he retired to monastery life&lt;/ref&gt;

However, some English titles without renouncing their utmost hostility sort of advanced kind of romantic gloom of a rebel, e.g. naming Santa Cruz "[[Jack Sheppard]] of Gipuzkoa", ''The Atenaeum'' 11.04.74, available [https://books.google.es/books?id=rT4xAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA486&amp;dq=cura+santa+cruz&amp;hl=pl&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjzi_imrY_aAhWGC5oKHd4DDzQQ6AEIVDAG#v=onepage&amp;q=cura%20santa%20cruz&amp;f=false here] &lt;/ref&gt; reported misdeeds of Santa Cruz,&lt;ref&gt;for a list of crimes he was charged with see ''El Motin'' 25.11.09, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0001175151&amp;page=8 here]&lt;/ref&gt; dubbed assassin, criminal or barbarian.&lt;ref&gt;"barbarian" – ''La Iberia'' 06.03.73, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0001364868&amp;page=2 here], "assassin" – ''El Imparcial'' 13.01.73, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000496025&amp;page=2 here], "bloody priest" – ''El Imparcial'' 05.03.73, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000497362&amp;page=3 here], responsible for crimes – ''La Iberia'' 22.01.73, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0001363052&amp;page=3 here], and ferocities – ''Revista de España'' 1873, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0002806230&amp;page=262 here]; in early 1873 he was already "tristemente celebre", ''El Periodico para Todos'' 13 (1873), available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0003438734&amp;page=15 here]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1874-1876 newspapers speculated about his re-entry into war.&lt;ref&gt; some titles claimed he had been noticed in specific locations in Spain and was to assume command, ''La Epoca'' 03.12.1874, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000328821&amp;page=3 here]&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1870s media lost track of him until he was located in Jamaica in the mid-1880s,&lt;ref&gt; ''El Motín'' 25.11.86, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0001136416&amp;page=2 here]&lt;/ref&gt; and his name reverberated as a memory of past atrocities. In 1880 he became one of key protagonists of ''Vida, hechos y hazañas del famoso bandido y cabecilla Rosa Samaniego'',&lt;ref&gt; Amelina Correa Ramón, ''Otra novela histórica del carlismo: La sima de Igúzquiza (1888)'', [in:] Angeles Ezama et al. (ed.), ''Aún aprendo. Estudios dedicados al profesor Leonardo Romero Tobar'', Zaragoza 2012, {{ISBN|9788415538233}}. p. 286&lt;/ref&gt; a short [[novel]] written by an unidentified author. The book portrayed Santa Cruz as a bloody ringleader; with many fictitious episodes&lt;ref&gt; e.g. the novel linked Santa Cruz to Rosa Samaniego, while in fact the two commanders have never met&lt;/ref&gt; it became very popular and was re-published until the early 1890s.&lt;ref&gt; the last identified re-edition is form 1893, compare ''GoogleBooks'' service, available [https://books.google.es/books/about/Vida_hechos_y_hazanas_del_famoso_bandido.html?id=IX5LtAEACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y here]&lt;/ref&gt; In the press Santa Cruz was not infrequently mentioned also as a sample of treacherous clergy.&lt;ref&gt; another religious man usually listed together with Santa Cruz as a sample of disloyal priest was the bishop of Urgel, see e.g. ''Las Dominicales'' 15.08.84, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0002615915&amp;page=2 here]&lt;/ref&gt; From time to time he was reported back in Europe;&lt;ref&gt; ''La Correspondencia de España'' 20.12.88, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000333783&amp;page=3 here]&lt;/ref&gt; as speculations about [[:es:Sublevación carlista de octubre de 1900|another Carlist insurgency]] were on the rise in the late 1890s Santa Cruz was even reported seen in Spain.&lt;ref&gt; e.g. in 1897 Santa Cruz was reported seen in Bilbao,  ''El Día'' 13.02.97, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0002371183&amp;page=2 here], and in Oyarzun, see ''La Epoca'' 21.02.97, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000620897&amp;page=2 here]. The Carlist hierarchs felt compelled to dismiss the news, see ''El Movimiento Católico'' 19.02.97, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0025564907&amp;page=2 here]&lt;/ref&gt; The wildest rumor had it that his son was to command a new Carlist unit.&lt;ref&gt; ''La Correspondencia Militar'' 14.09.99, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0001832401&amp;page=3 here]; it was soon corrected that the man in question was Santa Cruz’ nephew, ''Heraldo de Madrid'' 14.09.99, availavle [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000433595&amp;page=2 here]. Even the foreign press speculated that "exploits of the famous and bloodthirsty priest Santa Cruz would doubtless be imititated by many gentlemen of his sacred calling", James Roche, ''The Outlook for Carlism'', [in:] ''The North American Review'' 168/511 (1899), p. 742&lt;/ref&gt; A monument was erected in Enderlaza to honor the executed carabineros.&lt;ref&gt;a modest monument was first erected in 1907, replaced with a larger contruction in 1913, Mikelatz 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1897 Santa Cruz appeared in ''Paz en la guerra'' by [[Miguel de Unamuno]] and for some 20 years he kept featuring in greatest works of Spanish literary Modernism. In 1906 he was treated somewhat more extensively in ''Sonata de invierno'' by [[Ramón Valle-Inclán]],&lt;ref&gt; the key protagonist was another Carlist, Marqués de Bradomin; Santa Cruz was mentioned in passing&lt;/ref&gt; in 1908 in ''[[:es:Zalacaín el aventurero|Zalacaín el aventurero]]'' by [[Pio Baroja]], and in 1909 in two subsequent novels of Valle-Inclán, ''El resplandor de la hoguera'' and ''Gerifaltes de antaño'';&lt;ref&gt; interesting comments in Ernest Augustus Boyd, ''Studies from Ten Literatures'', New York 1925, p. 94&lt;/ref&gt; in the latter he was one of the two key protagonists. Finally, in 1918 Baroja dedicated him a set of essays ''El cura Santa Cruz y su partida''.&lt;ref&gt;Baroja wrote ''El cura Santa Cruz y su partida'' upon the false news that Santa Cruz had died in Colombia, Juan Van Halen, ''Baroja y la historia'', [in:] Pio Baroja, ''Juan van Halen'', Madrid 1998, {{ISBN|9788441404069}}, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Portrait of Pío Baroja.jpg|thumb|160px|[[Pio Baroja]]]]
The role assigned to Santa Cruz by all 3 giants of Spanish literature differed. Baroja from his [[Nietzschean]] perspective portrayed Santa Cruz as a little man who disguised his inferiority with cruelty and epitomized "double barbarity of being a Catholic and a Carlist".&lt;ref&gt; Juan Carlos Ara Torralba, ''Pérez Galdós y Baroja frente al carlismo'', [in:] ''Imagenes en carlismo en las artes'', Estella 2009, {{ISBN|9788423532278}}, p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; In case of Unamuno it is believed that Santa Cruz stood for inflexible model of orthodoxy, be it religious, political or otherwise, a model which was valid only within a set of parameters; Unamuno rejected it and presented the Spanish self as a result of dialectic interaction.&lt;ref&gt;"El rol del cura Santa Cruz al apoyar tanto al lado carlista como el lado católico y en interesarse sólo en su propia grey creyente destaca el papel inherente de una religión oficial como determinante sociológico de las creencias y del grupo en boga ... El cura, en este caso, siente que él tiene el derecho de fijar la ortodoxia cristiana además de añadir exigencias violentas para los fieles, reduciendo —según él— la salvación solamente a los seguidores de su autoridad. Su deseo de sólo atender a quienes aceptan sus mandatos limita aún más el concepto de la salvación universal de Cristo. Posiblemente, el rechazo del adolescente Unamuno a esa bomba fratricida, disfrazada de cristiana, haya sido semilla de su futuro desencanto con una religión vista como manipulación al servicio del poder o de prestigios personales y partidistas", Kevin Fagan, ''La libertad de conciencia en Miguel de Unamuno'', [in:] ''Alpha'' 29 (2009), p. 293. Some authors claim that Santa Cruz inspired Unamuno to write his late "nivola", ''San Manuel Bueno, Martír'', a piece which allegedly presents the title protagonist as almost a saint, Celis Alban 2003. In fact, the title protagonist is an exemplary priest serving his community to the utmost; eventually it is revealed that he did not believe in God&lt;/ref&gt; Even more complex is the vision of Valle-Inclán. Some claim that Valle-Inclán presented dominant and at times even monstrous personalities of the past to confront them with meager men populating contemporary Spain.&lt;ref&gt; Biruté Ciplijauskaité, ''Configuraciones literarias del Carlismo'', [in:] Stanley G. Payne (ed.), ''Identidad y nacionalismo en la España contemporánea, el Carlismo, 1833-1975'', Madison/Madrid 1996, {{ISBN|8487863469}}, p. 62&lt;/ref&gt; Others maintain that Valle-Inclán intended to evoke the atmosphere of ominous drama with satanic personalities.&lt;ref&gt; Leda Schiavo, ''Historia y novela en Valle-Inclán'', Madrid 1980, p. 29, referred after Ciplijauskaité 1996, p. 62&lt;/ref&gt; Whatever their intentions were, the [[Generation of '98|noventayochistas]] and especially Baroja transformed a somewhat crude newspaper version of Santa Cruz into a powerful literary image enriched with diabolic and demonic features. This image persisted well into the 1930s,&lt;ref&gt;see e.g. references to Santa Cruz as jackal or hyena, ''Diario de Almeria'' 23.01.34, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=2134342&amp;interno=S&amp;posicion=1&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; at times enhanced with new threads, e.g. this of "cura fascista".&lt;ref&gt;''El Liberal'' 17.06.36, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=1000082142&amp;interno=S&amp;posicion=5&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Francoist Spain]] the anti-Liberal stand of El Cura rendered cultivation of the black legend hardly feasible.&lt;ref&gt; Santa Cruz rather seldom featured in the press of 1940-1975, compare ''prensahistorica'' service, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/estaticos/contenido.cmd?pagina=estaticos/presentacion here]&lt;/ref&gt; After [[Spanish transition to democracy|transición]] it was already a forgotten past which hardly elicited emotions;&lt;ref&gt;for contemporary cartoon version of the black legend see a sample [http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_9y-KqwVm4No/Srtd9tLJZYI/AAAAAAAAAVQ/swORet61_yE/s320/comic2.jpg here]&lt;/ref&gt; if so, they were much more ambiguous.

Carlism initially ignored Santa Cruz.&lt;ref&gt; though liberal press referred to Santa Cruz whenever a threat of new Carlist unrest seemed looming, the movement did not accommodate Santa Cruz as a role model. He was missing in books listing heroes, claimants and commanders of the past, in leaflets and icononography featuring current political leaders, or in periodicals, see e.g. Francisco de Paula, ''Album de Personajes Carlistas con sus Biografias'', vols. I-III, Barcelona 1888, or B. de Artagan [Reynaldo Brea], ''Políticos del carlismo'', Barcelona 1912,&lt;/ref&gt; Re-calibrating the movement as "party of order", until late [[Restoration (Spain)|Restoration]] Traditionalist politicians viewed him as inconvenient ghost from their past.&lt;ref&gt; in 1890 the party leader [[Enrique de Aguilera y Gamboa|Márques de Cerralbo]] declared "no somos ni el cura Santa Cruz, ni Rosa Samaniego. Somos capaces de moralizar la administracion pública con nuestras doctrinas y procedimientos", Agustín Fernández Escudero, ''El marqués de Cerralbo (1845-1922): biografía politica'' [PhD thesis], Madrid 2012, p. 233&lt;/ref&gt; Things changed upon his death.&lt;ref&gt; the death of Santa Cruz was acknowledged in the Spanish press with information on his humble missionary activity prevailing. Already in the early 1920s he enjoyed somewhat more favorable treatment, e.g. some newspapers referred a letter he allegedly sent to the parish priest of his native village, - ''La Noche'' 24.11.24, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=1000379222&amp;interno=S&amp;posicion=2&amp;presentacion=pagina here], or in 1926 floated rumors about his penitent pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, ''Las Provincias'' 14.08.26, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=1000308599&amp;interno=S&amp;posicion=1&amp;presentacion=pagina here]. A contemporary historian claims that "la muerte y el supuesto periplo de su alma [in 1920s he was referred in relation to a widely publicised mystic vision of a visionary Benita Aguirre] coincidiran, en todo caso, con una variacion muy significativa en el curso y en el tono de la literatura sobre su [Santa Cruz'] personaje", Canal 2000, p. 181&lt;/ref&gt; Late 1920s saw three apologetic works,&lt;ref&gt; which led some papers to conclude that "rigurosa revisión histórica" was ongoing, ''La Correspondencia de Valencia'' 17.09.32, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=1000247071&amp;interno=S&amp;posicion=4&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; two flavored with Carlism; [[:eu:Gaëtan Bernoville|Bernoville]]&lt;ref&gt; Gaetan Bernoville, ''La Croix de Sang. Histoire du Curé Santa Cruz'', Paris 1928; it was translated the same year into Spanish and published as ''La Cruz Sangrienta. Historia del Cura Santa Cruz'', San Sebastián 1928 (308 pages)&lt;/ref&gt; focused on Catholic regionalism while [[Juan Olazábal Ramery|Olazábal]]&lt;ref&gt; Juan Olazábal y Ramery, ''El Cura Santa Cruz guerillero'', Vitoria 1928 (680 pages)&lt;/ref&gt; on [[Integrism (Spain)|Integrism]];&lt;ref&gt; the uncritical account of Santa Cruz, especially the one by Bernoville, was repelled by a Carlist [[Julio de Urquijo e Ibarra|Julio Urquijo]] in ''La Cruz de Sangre. El Cura Santa Cruz. Pequeña rectificación histórica'', San Sebastián 1928 (62 pages)&lt;/ref&gt; the third one by [[:es:Nicolás Ormaechea|Orixe]] advanced [[Basque people|Basque]] threads.&lt;ref&gt; it was written in Basque and its decared purpose was pedagogical, to teach the Basques their past: "Santa Cruz’en berri ematen dun liburua ikusi ezkero, erriak gogotik elduko diola nago, ta eskeraz irakurtzea zaila bada era ... oituko al dire euskaldunak irakurtzen", referred after Gorka Aulestia, ''The Basque Poetic Tradition'', Reno 2000, {{ISBN|9780874172836}}, p. 73&lt;/ref&gt; Confrontational political milieu of the [[Second Spanish Republic|Republic]] helped the Carlists to re-claim Santa Cruz,&lt;ref&gt;Canal 2000, p. 182&lt;/ref&gt; e.g. in poetry,&lt;ref&gt;a Carlist poet [[:es:Ignacio Romero Raizábal|Ignacio Romero Raizabal]] dedicated a poem to Santa Cruz, ''El Siglo Futuro'' 07.06.34, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000526017&amp;page=3&amp;search=%22cura+santa+cruz%22&amp;lang=es here]. Santa Cruz occasionally featured in poetry also earlier on, referred to evoke the atmoshphere of heroism and savagery, see ''O Cura Santa Cruz'' by a Brasilian-Portuguese poet [[Gonçalves Crespo]], Pedro Nava, ''Chão de ferro'', vol. 3, Sao Paulo 2001, {{ISBN|9788574800226}}, p. 131&lt;/ref&gt; and upon outbreak of the [[Spanish Civil War|civil war]] Traditionalist press linked military virtues of [[Requetés]] to these of El Cura.&lt;ref&gt; ''Pensamiento Alavés'' 26.03.38, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=1000035420&amp;interno=S&amp;posicion=1&amp;presentacion=pagin here]a&lt;/ref&gt; The Enderlaza monument was blown up by Carlist troops advancing from Navarre to Gipuzkoa in [[Spanish coup of July 1936|July 1936]],&lt;ref&gt; Mikelatz 2016&lt;/ref&gt; but got silently reinstated in 1940.&lt;ref&gt; this time with no reference to perpetrators. It is not clear who ordered the monument to be re-erected, some authors suspect it was the work of some local military commander, Mikelatz 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Two major Carlist historiographical works, written by [[Román Oyarzun Oyarzun|Oyarzun]] in the 1940s&lt;ref&gt;Roman Oyarzun, ''Historia del carlismo'', Madrid 1969 [subsequent edition], pp. 330-335. Santa Cruz was presented as a rebelious and non-disciplined follower who caused more harm than good to the cause; he is deemed ultimately responsible for atrocities committed by his unit, though direct blame is laid on his lieutenants Frasku and Corneta, genuinely evil personalities&lt;/ref&gt; and by [[Melchor Ferrer Dalmau|Ferrer]] in the 1950s, approached El Cura with caution.&lt;ref&gt; Melchor Ferrer, ''Historia del tradicionalismo español'', vols. XXIV-XXV, Sevilla 1958&lt;/ref&gt; In popular propaganda there were cases of exaltation&lt;ref&gt; at times Cura Santa Cruz featured on equal footing with iconic Carlist personalities of the highest rank, like Carlos VII, Zumalacárregui or doña Margarita, see José Angel de Igarzabal, ''Acto cultural en Azcoitia'', [in:] ''Montejurra'' 12 (1965), p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; yet Santa Cruz did not become an orthodox mythical hero.&lt;ref&gt; the most popular and best-selling Carlist review ''[[Montejurra (magazine)|Montejurra]]'', published in the 1960s, ran a section on history of Carlism. Not a single time Santa Cruz was featured as its protagonist&lt;/ref&gt; Youths from the progressist faction of [[:es:Comunión Tradicionalista|Comunión Tradicionalista]] tried to re-claim El Cura, and in the early 1970s their terrorist organisation [[:es:Grupos de Acción Carlista|GAC]] declared that "the flag of Santa Cruz has been raised again".&lt;ref&gt; Jeremy MacClancy, ''The Decline of Carlism'', Reno 2000, {{ISBN|9780874173444}} , p. 165&lt;/ref&gt; Today Santa Cruz marginally features on some private Carlist websites.&lt;ref&gt;see e.g. ''Dos reliquias históricas del célebre guerrillero carlista Cura Santa Cruz han llegado a España'', [in:] ''TradicionViva'' service 13.04.15, available [http://www.tradicionviva.es/2015/04/13/dos-reliquias-historicas-del-celebre-guerrillero-carlista-cura-santa-cruz-han-llegado-a-espana/ here]. Perhaps the site which most closely follows the Carlist Santa Cruz legend is ''ElBandidoRealista'' service, which in its iconographic layer is heavily based on mass-culture-adopted visual references to Santa Cruz, see e.g. ''Contra todos'', [in:] ''ElBandidoRealista'' service 28.04.09, available [http://elbandidorealista.blogspot.com/search/label/Cura%20Santa%20Cruz#!/tcmbck here].

[[File:X borroka.jpg|thumb|160px|''Fight is the way'', or is it? nationalist murale in [[Names of the Basque Country (in Spanish)|Vascongadas]]]]
In vasco-navarrese area the Carlist social base was gradually taken over by [[Basque nationalism]].&lt;ref&gt; Santa Cruz was Basque and he spoke the Gipuzkoan Basque dialect as his mother tongue; also members of his unit were almost all Basques. Basque was the language of command and all communication; if any soldier spoke Spanish he had to excuse himself, José Ignacio Finez García, ''Fuerismo tradicionalista y nacionalismo vasco'' [PhD thesis Universidad Salamanca], Salamanca 2013, p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; Its radical faction attempted to re-format the image of Santa Cruz accordingly;&lt;ref&gt;non-violent factions of Basque nationalism also claimed the memory of Santa Cruz, see e.g. the entry dedicated to El Cura and his reception in Eugenio Ibarzábal Aranberri, ''Días de ilusión y vértigo. 1977-1987'', Bilbao 2016, {{ISBN|9788491091516}}&lt;/ref&gt; violence and fanaticism were converted into virtues.&lt;ref&gt; Santa Cruz was presented as sort of gudari avant la lettre, Gaizka Fernández Soldevilla, ''Ecos de la Guerra Civil. La glorificación del gudari en la génesis de la violencia de ETA (1936-1968)'', [in:] ''Bulletin d’Histoire Contemporaine d’Espagne'' 49 (2014), p. 253&lt;/ref&gt; El Cura started to feature in nationalist propaganda as a convenient hyperbole for violent action; in the 1980s a [[Herri Batasuna]] newspaper ''[[Egin (newspaper)|Egin]]'' ran a series of lengthy articles on El Cura and no nationalist figure dared to criticize him.&lt;ref&gt; MacClancy 2000, p. 236&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, papers noticed "admiration of left-wing youth for legendary Santa Cruz"&lt;ref&gt;"admiración que sienten muchos jóvenes de izquierda por el legendario cura Santa Cruz", ''Caro Baroja denuncia los peligros del sincretismo cultural vasco'', [in:] ''El País'' 17.03.81, available [https://elpais.com/diario/1981/03/17/cultura/353631610_850215.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Pío Caro Baroja|Baroja]] observed that "you can meet Cura Santa Cruz on any Basque street today".&lt;ref&gt;Paddy Woodworth, ''The Basque Country: A Cultural History'', London 2012, {{ISBN|9781908493224}}, available [https://books.google.es/books?id=Pbu_BAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT98&amp;lpg=PT98&amp;dq=cura+santa+cruz+ETA&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=q3si0th3U1&amp;sig=NlTq7NN2gTWkXZ0bvomaFNCPIKI&amp;hl=pl&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiV47eTnaPaAhWhQpoKHaBIC9M4ChDoAQgnMAA#v=onepage&amp;q=cura%20santa%20cruz%20ETA&amp;f=false here]. In the mid-1990s the press noticed a phenomenon of "santacrucismo urbano" among the Basque youth, José Antonio Ayestaran Leguona, ''Santacrucismo urbano'', [in:] ''El País'' 13.07.95, available [https://elpais.com/diario/1995/07/13/opinion/805586408_850215.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; The vision of El Cura as spiritual embodiment of "these mountains", unforgiving but idealistic, was pursued in a 1990 Basque film of José Tuduri.&lt;ref&gt;''Santa Cruz, el cura guerrillero'' (1 h 33 mins), see [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0102839/fullcredits/?ref_=tt_ov_st_sm filmweb]; in the film Santa Cruz was dissociated from Carlism and presented as independent war leader guided by religious principles; the Carlists were presented as wealthy aristocratic señoritos. The film closes with commentary about the mountains which have always resisted the foreigners, see ''Santa Cruz, el cura guerrillero'', [in:] ''YouTube'' service, available [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p88ZsRKvYJQ here]. The film was not received well by the pundits and was a commercial success neither, ''Santa Cruz el Cura Guerrillero'' entry, [in:] ''Aunamendi Eusko Entziklopedia'' service, available [http://aunamendi.eusko-ikaskuntza.eus/es/santa-cruz-el-cura-guerrillero/ar-106405/ here]&lt;/ref&gt; Also a Basque historiographical study by [[:eu:Xabier Azurmendi|Xabier Azurmendi]]&lt;ref&gt; Xabier Azurmendi, ''El cura Santa Cruz'', Bilbao 1986; some sources claim that Azurmendi merely edited the work, written by Ignacio Ariztimuño, see ''Euskonews'' service, available [http://www.euskonews.com/0613zbk/efem61302es.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; set the protagonist deeply against the Basque background. Today Santa Cruz is still present in nationalist discourse and features on some websites, usually flavored with radical Left-wing politics.&lt;ref&gt;see e.g. Borrokagaraia, ''El cupo.

== History ==
===Ancient to medieval period===

During the ancient period, around 230 BC, [[Maharashtra]] came under the rule of the [[Satavahana dynasty]] which ruled the region for 400 years.&lt;ref name="autogenerated440"&gt;India Today: An Encyclopedia of Life in the Republic: p.440&lt;/ref&gt; The greatest ruler of the Satavahana Dynasty was [[Gautamiputra Satakarni|Gautami putra Satakarni]]{{Relevance inline|date=January 2018}}. The [[Vakataka dynasty]] ruled Maharashtra from the 3rd century to the 5th century.&lt;ref&gt;History of Humanity: From the seventh century B.C. to the seventh century A.D.  by Sigfried J. de Laet, Joachim Herrmann p.392&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Chalukya dynasty]] ruled Maharashtra from the 6th century to the 8th century. The two prominent rulers were [[Pulakeshin II]], who defeated the north Indian Emperor [[Harsha|Harsh]], and [[Vikramaditya II]], who defeated Arab invaders{{Who|date=January 2018}} in the 8th century. The [[Rashtrakuta Dynasty]] ruled Maharashtra from the 8th to the 10th century.&lt;ref&gt;Indian History - page B-57&lt;/ref&gt; The Arab traveler Sulaiman{{Who|date=January 2018}} called the ruler of the Rashtrakuta Dynasty ([[Amoghavarsha]])  'one of the 4 great kings of the world'.&lt;ref name="autogenerated203"&gt;A Comprehensive History Of Ancient India (3 Vol. Set): p.203&lt;/ref&gt; From the early 11th century to the 12th century the [[Deccan Plateau]] was dominated by the [[Western Chalukya Empire]] and the [[Chola dynasty]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated365"&gt;The Penguin History of Early India: From the Origins to AD 1300 by [[Romila Thapar]]: p.365-366&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Seuna dynasty]], also known as the Yadava dynasty of [[Devagiri]], ruled Maharashtra from the 13th century to the 14th century.&lt;ref&gt;People of India: Maharashtra, Part 1 by B. V. Bhanu p.6&lt;/ref&gt; The Yadavas were defeated by the Khaljis in 1321. After the Yadav defeat, the area was ruled for the next 300 years by a succession of Muslim rulers including (in chronological order): the [[Khalji dynasty|Khaljis]], the [[Tughlaq]]s, the [[Bahamani Sultanate]] and its successor states called the [[Deccan sultanates]] such as [[Adilshahi]], [[Ahmadnagar Sultanate|Nizamshahi]], and the [[Mughal Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historyfiles.co.uk/KingListsFarEast/IndiaBahamanis.htm|title=Kingdoms of South Asia – Indian Bahamani Sultanate|publisher=The History Files, United Kingdom|accessdate=12 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The early period of Islamic rule saw atrocities such as the imposition of a [[Jaziya]] tax on non-Muslims, temple destruction and forcible conversions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Paranjape|first1=Makarand|title=Cultural Politics in Modern India: Postcolonial prospects, colourful cosmopolitanism, global proximities|date=19 January 2016|publisher=Routledge India|isbn=1138956929|pages=34, 35}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Haidar|first1=Navina Najat|last2=Sardar|first2=Marika|title=Sultans of the South: Arts of India's Deccan Courts, 1323-1687|date=27 December 2011|publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art|isbn=0300175876|page=186}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the mainly Hindu population and their Islamic rulers came to an accommodation over time. For most of this period [[Brahmin]]s were in charge of accounts whereas revenue collection was in the hands of [[Maratha]]s who had [[Vatandar|watans]] (Hereditary rights) of [[Patil (title)|Patil]]ki (revenue collection at village level), and [[Deshmukh]]i (revenue collection over a larger area). A number of families such as [[Bhosale]], Shirke, Ghorpade, [[Jadhav]], More, [[Mahadik]], [[Kagal|Ghatge]], and [[Nimbalkar]] loyally served different sultans at different periods in time. All [[vatandar|watandar]] considered their watan a source of economic power and pride and were reluctant to part with it. The watandars were the first to oppose Shivaji because it hurt their economic interests.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kulkarni|first1=G.T.|title=DECCAN (MAHARASHTRA) UNDER THE MUSLIM RULERS FROM KHALJIS TO SHIVAJI : A STUDY IN INTERACTION, PROFESSOR S.M KATRE Felicitation|journal=Bulletin of the Deccan College Research Institute|date=1992|volume=51/52,|pages=501–510|jstor=42930434}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since most of the population was Hindu and spoke Marathi, even the sultans such as [[Ibrahim Adil Shah I]] adopted Marathi as the court language for administration and record keeping.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gordon|first1=Stewart|title=Cambridge History of India: The Marathas 1600-1818|date=1993|publisher=Cambridge University press|location=Cambridge, UK|isbn=978-0-521-26883-7|page=16|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=iHK-BhVXOU4C&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR9&amp;dq=marathi++nizamshahi+stewart+gordon&amp;ots=S0NVX_OIfl&amp;sig=-zaEHdQ5CoFqTQm5aeIDw5YGhKY#v=onepage&amp;q=deshastha&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kamat|first1=Jyotsna|title=The Adil Shahi Kingdom  (1510 CE to 1686 CE)|url=http://www.kamat.com/kalranga/bijapur/adilshahis.htm|website=Kamat's Potpourri|accessdate=4 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Islamic rule also led to Persian vocabulary being used in the Marathi language. Per Kulkarni, for the elites of the era using Persian words was a status symbol. Surnames derived from service during that period such as Fadnis, Chitnis, Mirasdar etc. are still in use.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt;

Most of the Marathi [[Bhakti movement|Bhakti]] poet saints, who worshipped [[Vithoba|Vitthal]], belong to the period between late Yadava to late Islamic era.These include [[Dnyaneshwar]], [[Namdev]], [[Eknath]], and [[Tukaram]].Other important religious figures of this era were [[Narsimha Saraswati]], and [[Mahanubhava]] sect founder, [[Chakradhar Swami]]  All of them used [[Marathi language]] rather than [[Sanskrit]] for their devotional and philosophical compositions.

The decline of Islamic rule in Deccan started when [[Shivaji]] founded the Maratha Empire by annexing a portion of the Bijapur Sultanate in 1674. [[Shivaji]] later led rebellions against the Mughal rule, thus becoming a symbol of Hindu resistance and self-rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chary|first1=Manish Telikicherla|title=India: Nation on the Move: An Overview of India's People, Culture, History, Economy, IT Industry, &amp; More|publisher=iUniverse|isbn=1440116350|page=96}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maratha Empire went on to end the Mughal rule and ruled over a vast empire stretching from [[Attock]] to [[Cuttack]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Chandorkar|first1=Avinash|title=From The Capital Of India To A Divisional Headquarter: Pune’s Long Journey|url=https://swarajyamag.com/culture/pune-through-the-prism-of-maratha-empires-rise-and-fall|accessdate=13 January 2018|publisher=Swarajya}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Maratha Empire===
====Political history====
In the mid-17th century, [[Shivaji Maharaj]] (1630–1680) founded the Maratha Empire by conquering the [[Desh, Maharashtra|Desh]] and the [[Konkan]] region from the Adilshahi, and established ''[[Hindavi Swarajya|Hindavi Swaraj]]'' ('self-rule of Hindu people').&lt;ref name="9780754639503p38"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PxvDNBc4qwUC&amp;pg=PA38|title=Vijayanagara voices: exploring South Indian history and Hindu literature|last=Jackson|first=William Joseph|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|year=2005|isbn=9780754639503|page=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;) The Marathas are credited to a large extent with ending Mughal rule in India.&lt;ref name="pearson2"&gt;{{cite journal |first=M.

Shivaji's son [[Sambhaji]], and successor as [[Chhatrapati]], led the Marathas valiantly against the much stronger Mughal opponent, but in 1689, after being betrayed, he was captured, tortured and killed by Mughal emperor, [[Aurangzeb]].&lt;ref&gt;''Sambhaji'' – Patil, Vishwas, Mehta Publishing House, Pune, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The war against the Mughals was then led by the Sambhaji's younger brother and successor [[Rajaram Chhatrapati]]. Upon Rajaram's death in 1700, his widow [[Tarabai]] took command of Maratha forces and won many battles against the Mughals. In 1707, upon the death of Aurangzeb, the [[War of 27 years]] between the much weakened Mughals and Marathas came to an end.&lt;ref name="Tarabai"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Eh1BAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=rajaram+became+chhatrapati&amp;dq=rajaram+became+chhatrapati&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=QlXZT5ygA4TTrQfRrbXIBg&amp;redir_esc=y|title=Maharani Tarabai of Kolhapur, c. 1675-1761 A.D.|first=Śālinī|last=Pāṭīla|date=11 August 1987|publisher=S.

Shahu, the grandson of Shivaji, with the help of capable Maratha administrators and generals such as the Peshwa [[Balaji Vishwanath]] and his descendants, saw the greatest expansion of Maratha power. After Shahu's death in 1749, the [[Peshwa]] Nanasaheb and his successors became the virtual rulers of the Empire. The Empire was expanded by many chieftains including Peshwa [[Bajirao I|Bajirao Ballal I]] and his descendants, the [[Scindia|Shindes]], [[Gaekwad]], [[Pawar]], [[Bhonsale]] of Nagpur and the [[Holkar]]s. The Empire at its peak stretched from [[Tamil Nadu]] in the south, to [[Maratha conquest of North-west India|Peshawar]] (modern-day [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]])&lt;ref name="XWiACEwPR8C p.162"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bXWiACEwPR8C&amp;pg=PR22|title=An Advanced History of Modern India|first=Sailendra Nath|last=Sen|date=11 August 2017|publisher=Macmillan India|accessdate=11 August 2017|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the north, and [[Maratha expeditions in Bengal|Bengal]] in the east.&lt;ref name="pearson2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="andamanonline.in"&gt;[http://www.andamanonline.in/about/Profile/History/index.html Andaman &amp; Nicobar Origin | Andaman &amp; Nicobar Island History]. Andamanonline.in.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pune]], under the Peshwa, became the imperial seat with envoys, ambassadors, and royals coming in from far and near. However, after the [[Third battle of Panipat]], in which the Marathas were defeated by [[Ahmed Shah Abdali]], the Empire broke up into many independent kingdoms. Due to the efforts of [[Mahadji Shinde]], it remained a confederacy until the British East India Company defeated Peshwa [[Bajirao II]]. Nevertheless, several Maratha states remained as [[vassals]] of the British until 1947 when they acceded to the [[Dominion of India]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/selectionsfromp01metcgoog/selectionsfromp01metcgoog_djvu.txt|title=Full text of "Selections from the papers of Lord Metcalfe; late governor-general of India, governor of Jamaica, and governor-general of Canada"|work=archive.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Social history====
Before British rule, the Maharashtra region was divided into many revenue divisions. The medieval equivalent of a county or district was the [[Pargana]]. The chief of the Pargana was called Deshmukh and record keepers were called [[Deshpande]]. Most Deshmukhs were from the elite Maratha families. The Deshpande belonged to Brahmin or [[CKP]] communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gordon|first1=Stewart|title=The Marathas 1600-1818|date=1993|publisher=Cambridge University|location=New York|isbn=978-0521268837|pages=22, xiii|edition=1. publ.|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=iHK-BhVXOU4C&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR9&amp;dq=%22deshmukh%22+%22deshpande%22+sultanate+pargana&amp;ots=S0VTQ6PFkm&amp;sig=CX8sFOw4AHbj45pctsJpTmxVAQ8#v=snippet&amp;q=deshpande&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="People of India: Maharashtra, Part 3 - Google Books"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4bfmnmsBfQ4C&amp;pg=PR45&amp;dq=deshpande+surname&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=wqO8TpinC8jlrAez2IS8AQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CFIQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=deshpande%20&amp;f=false | title=People of India: Maharashtra, Part 3 - Google Books | publisher=Popular Prakashan, 2004 | author=B.

===British colonial rule===
The British rule of more than a century in the present-day Maharashtra region saw huge changes for the Marathi people in every aspect of their lives. Areas that correspond to present day Maharashtra were under direct or indirect British rule, first under the [[East India Trading Company]], and then under the [[British crown|British raj]] from 1858. During this era Marathi people resided in the [[Bombay presidency]], [[Berar Province|Berar]], [[Central Provinces|Central provinces]], [[Hyderabad state]] and in various [[princely states]] that are currently part of present-day Maharashtra.Significant Marathi populations also resided in Maratha princely states far from Maharashtra such as [[Baroda State|Baroda]], [[Gwalior State|Gwalior]], [[Indore State|Indore]], and [[Tanjore]].
The [[British Raj|British colonial period]] saw standardisation of Marathi grammar through the efforts of the Christian missionary [[William Carey (missionary)|William Carey]].Carey also published the first dictionary of Marathi in [[Devanagari]] script. The most comprehensive Marathi-English dictionary was compiled by Captain [[James Thomas Molesworth]] and Major [[Thomas Candy]] in 1831.The book is still in print nearly two centuries after its publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=James, Molesworth, Thomas Candy|first=Narayan G Kalelkar|title=Molesworth's, Marathi-English dictionary|year=1857 |edition=2nd &lt;!-- |year=1975 corrected reprint --&gt;|publisher=J.C.

The Marathi community played an important part in the social and religious reform movements, as well as the nationalist movement of the late 19th and early 20th centuries.Notable [[civil society]] bodies founded by Marathi leaders during the 19th century include the [[Poona Sarvajanik Sabha]], the [[Prarthana Samaj]], the Arya Mahila Samaj, and the [[Satya Shodhak Samaj]].The Pune Sarvajanik Sabha took an active part in relief efforts during the famine of 1875-76.It is considered the forerunner of the [[Indian National Congress]] established in 1885.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Johnson|first1=Gordon|title=Provincial Politics and Indian nationalism : Bombay and the Indian National Congress, 1880 - 1915|date=1973|publisher=Univ.

After the Maratha-Kunbi cluster, the scheduled caste (SC) Mahars are numerically the second largest community among the Marathi people in Maharashtra. Most of them embraced [[Buddhism]] in 1956 with their leader, the late [[Bhimrao Ambedkar|Dr. Ambedkar]].&lt;ref name="Routledge"/&gt; Writers from this group in the 1950s and 60s were pioneers of [[Dalit Literature]]&lt;ref name=chap23&gt;{{cite book|editor-last1=Kachru|editor-first1=Braj B. |editor-last2=Kachru|editor-first2=Yamuna |editor-last3=Sridhar|editor-first3=S.

The Portuguese-occupied enclave of Goa was liberated in 1962. The main political party formed immediately after liberation was the [[Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party]]. It wanted Goa to merge with Maharashtra because of the affinity between Goan Hindus and the Marathi people. However, the [[Goa Opinion Poll|referendum]] held on this issue rejected the merger. Later, [[Konkani language|Konkani]] was made the official language of Goa, but Marathi is also allowed in any government correspondence.

The 1960s also saw the establishment by [[Bal Thackeray]] of Shiv Sena, a populist sectarian party advocating the rights of Marathi people in the heterogeneous city of Mumbai. Early campaigns by Shiv Sena advocated for more opportunities for Marathi people in government jobs. The party also led a campaign against the city's South Indian population. By the 1980s the party captured power in the [[Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation|Mumbai Corporation]], and in the 1990s it led the government of Maharashtra's coalition with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). During this transition from founding to capturing power, the party toned down its rhetoric against non-Marathi people and adopted a more Hindu nationalist stance.

===Hindu castes in Maharashtra===
Majority of Marathi Hindu belong either to the cultivator class ([[Maratha]]-[[Kunbi]]) or one of the village servant ([[Bara Balutedar]])castes.

=== In other Indian states ===
As the Maratha Empire expanded across India, the Marathi population started migrating out of Maharashtra alongside their rulers.Peshwa, [[Holkars]], Scindia and [[Gaekwad dynasty|Gaekwad]] dynastic leaders took with them a considerable population of priests, clerks, army men, businessmen, and workers when they established new seats of power.Most of these migrants were from the literate classes such as various Brahmin sub-castes and [[CKP]].These groups formed the backbone of administration in the new Maratha states in many places such as [[Baroda]], [[Indore]], [[Gwalior]], [[Bundelkhand]], and [[Tanjore]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Roberts|first1=John|title=The Movement of Elites in Western India under Early British Rule|journal=The Historical Journal|date=1971|volume=14|issue=2|pages=243–244|jstor=2637955}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Many families belonging to these groups still follow typical Marathi traditions even though they have lived more than {{convert|1,000|km}} from Maharashtra for more than 200 years.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Other people have migrated in modern times in search of jobs outside Maharashtra. These people have also settled in almost all parts of the country. They have set up community organizations called [[Maharashtra Mandal]]s in many cities across the country. A national level central organization, the [[Brihan Maharashtra]] Mandal was formed in 1958&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bmmindia.org/bmmindia_history.php|title=Brihan Maharashtra Mandal|author=Synques|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; to promote Marathi culture outside Maharashtra.

=== Outside India ===
In the 1800s, a large number of [[Non-resident Indian and Person of Indian Origin|Indian people]] were taken to [[Mauritius]], [[Fiji]], [[South Africa]], [[Trinidad and Tobago]], [[Guyana]], [[Suriname]], [[Jamaica]], and other places in the [[Caribbean]] as [[Indian indenture system|indentured laborers]] to work on [[sugarcane]] plantations. The majority of these migrants were from the [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]] speaking areas or from [[Southern India]], however, the migrants to Mauritius included a significant number of Marathis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mauritiusmarathi.org/menu/history.php|title=mauritiusmarathi.org|website=Mauritiusmarathi.org|accessdate=11 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maharashtra.gov.in/pdf/gazeetter_reprint/Ratnagiri/ratnagiri/pop1_villages.html#4] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071210032510/http://www.maharashtra.gov.in/pdf/gazeetter_reprint/Ratnagiri/ratnagiri/pop1_villages.html#4|date=10 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the state of Israel was established in 1948, around 25,000-30,000 Jews have emigrated there, of which around 20,000 were from the Marathi speaking [[Bene Israel]] community of Konkan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indiandiaspora.nic.in/diasporapdf/chapter9.pdf|format=PDF|title=Chapter 9 : India|website=Indiandiaspora.nic.in|accessdate=2017-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Indians, including Marathi People, have migrated to Europe and particularly Great Britain for more than a century. The Maharashtra Mandal of London was founded in 1932.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mmlondon.co.uk/index.asp] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080619144843/http://www.mmlondon.co.uk/index.asp|date=19 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; A small number of Marathi people also settled in [[British East Africa]] during the colonial era.&lt;ref&gt;Pathak, A.R., 1995.

Large-scale immigration of Indians into the United States started when the [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965]] came into effect. Most of the Marathi immigrants who came after 1965 were professionals such as doctors, engineers or scientists. The second wave of immigration took place during the I.T. boom of the 1990s and later.

Since the 1990s due to the [[Information technology|I.T.]] boom and because of the general ease of travel, Marathi people are now found in greater numbers in all corners of the world including the United States, Australia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marathi.org.au/ |title=Marathi Sydney, MASI, Maharastrians in Sydney, Marathi Mandal « Marathi Association Sydney Inc (MASI) |publisher=Marathi.org.au |date= |accessdate=2013-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Canada,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mbmtoronto.com/history.htm |title=Marathi Bhashik Mandal Toronto, Inc |publisher=Mbmtoronto.com |date=2008-11-15 |accessdate=2013-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Gulf countries,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maharashtra-mandal-dubai.com/about.html|title=三菱の車  » Blog Archive   » 人気のトラック|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; European countries,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=人気ファンデーションで綺麗に魅せる |url=http://www.ems2008.org/ |title=人気ファンデーションで綺麗に魅せる |publisher=Ems2008.org |date= |accessdate=2013-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Japan, and China.

{{Main|Religion in Maharashtra}}

The majority of Marathi people are [[Hindu]]s.&lt;ref name="Maharashtra Religions"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.bharatonline.com/maharashtra/culture/religion.html|title = Maharashtra Religions|date = |accessdate =2017-08-11 |website = Bharatonline.com|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Minorities by religion include [[Marathi Muslims|Muslims]], [[Marathi Buddhists|Buddhists]], [[Marathi Jains|Jains]], [[Marathi Christians|Christians]] and Jews.&lt;ref name="Maharashtra Religions"/&gt;

===Marathi Hindu Customs===

[[File:Deepmal at Yamai temple Aundh Satara India 15393016 10207854876154055 1249608055689690084 o.jpg|right|thumb|An old Hindu temple in Maharashtra with the traditional lighting pole (Deepmal)]]

The main life ceremonies in Hindu culture include those related to birth, weddings, initiation ceremonies, as well as death rituals. Other ceremonies for different occasions in Hindu life include ''Vastushanti'' and "Satyanarayan" which is performed before a family formally establishes residence in a new house. [[Satyanarayana Puja]] is a ceremony performed before commencing any new endeavour or for no particular reason. Invoking the name of the family's [[gotra]] and the ''kula daivat'' are important aspects of these ceremonies for many communities.
[[File:Khandoba in a household shrine.JPG|right|thumb|A Marathi household shrine with [[Khandoba]] at the forefront]]
Like most other Hindu communities, the Marathi people have a household shrine called a ''devaghar'' with idols, symbols, and pictures of various deities for daily worship. Ritual reading of religious texts known as ''[[Palm-leaf manuscript|pothi]]'' is also popular in some communities.

In some traditional families, food is first offered to the preferred deity in the household shrine, as ''[[naivedya]]'', before being consumed by family members and guests. Meals or snacks are not taken before this religious offering. In present times, the naivedya is offered by families only on days of special religious significance.

Many Marathi people trace their paternal ancestors to one of the seven or eight sages, the [[saptarshi]]. They classify themselves as gotras, named after the ancestor [[rishi]]. Intra-marriage within gotras (Sagotra Vivaha) was uncommon until recently, being discouraged as it was likened to incest.

Most Marathi families have their own family patron or protective deity or the ''[[kuladevata|Kuladaivat]]''. This deity is common to a lineage or a clan of several families who are connected to each other through a common ancestor.{{sfn|Walunjkar|pp=285–287}} The [[Khandoba]] of Jejuri is an example of a Kuladaivat of some families; he is a common Kuladaivat to several castes ranging from Brahmins to [[Dalit]]s.{{sfn|Government of Maharashtra|1962|p=}} The practice of worshiping local or territorial deities as Kuladaivats began in the period of the [[Yadava dynasty]].{{sfn|Walunjkar|pp=285–287}} Other family deities of the people of Maharashtra are [[Bhavani]] of [[Tuljapur]], [[Mahalakshmi Temple, Kolhapur|Mahalaxmi]] of [[Kolhapur]], Mahalaxmi of [[Amravati]], [[Renuka]] of [[Mahur, Maharashtra|Mahur]], [[Parashuram]] in Konkan, [[Saptashringi]] on Saptashringa hill at Vani in Nasik district, and [[Venkateswara|Balaji]] . Despite being the most popular deity amongst Marathi people, very few families regard [[Vitthal]] or other popular [[Avatar]]s of [[Vishnu]] such as [[Rama]] or [[Krishna]] as their Kuldaivat.

====Ceremonies and rituals====

At birth, a child is initiated into the family ritually. The child's naming ceremony may happen many weeks or even months later, and it is called the ''barsa''. In many Indian Hindu communities, the naming is most often done by consulting the child's horoscope, which suggests various names depending on the child's Lunar sign (called ''Rashi''). However, in Marathi Hindu families, the name that the child inevitably uses in secular functions is the one decided by their parents. If a name is chosen on the basis of the horoscope, then that is kept a secret to ward off the casting of a spell on the child during their life. During the naming ceremony, the child's [[paternal aunt]] has the honor of naming the infant. When the child is 11 months old, they get their first hair-cut.{{sfn|Ghosal|2004|pp=478–480}} This is also an important ritual and is called ''Jawal''. In the Maratha community, the maternal uncle is given the honour of the first snip during the ceremony.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Carter|first1=A. T.|title=A Comparative Analysis of Systems of Kinship and Marriage in South Asia|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland No. 1973 (1973), pp. 29-54|date=1973|issue=1973|page=33|jstor=3031719}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Brahman, CKP and Gaud Saraswat Brahman communities when a male child{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} reaches his eighth birthday, he undergoes the initiation thread ceremony variously known as Munja (in reference to the Munja grass that is of official ritual specification), ''Vratabandha'', or [[Upanayanam]].{{sfn|Mookerji|1989|pp=174–175}}

Marathi Hindu people are historically [[endogamous]] within their caste but exogamous with their clan.{{sfn|Ghosal|2004|pp=478–480}}[[Parallel and cross cousins|Cross-cousin]] alliances are allowed by most Marathi Hindu communities.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; [[Hindu wedding|Hindu marriages]], take place by negotiation. The [[Mangalsutra]] is the symbol of marriage for the woman. Studies show that most Indians' traditional views on caste, religion, and family background have remained unchanged when it came to marriage,{{sfn|Bahuguna|2004|p=}} that is, people marry within their own castes,{{sfn|Srinivasa-Raghavan|2009|p=}} and matrimonial advertisements in newspapers are still classified by caste and sub-caste.{{sfn|The Economist|2010|p=}}

While arranging a marriage, ''gana'', ''gotra'', ''pravara'', ''devak'' are all kept in mind. Horoscopes are matched.{{sfn|Ghosal|2004|p=479}} Ghosal describes the marriage ceremony as, 'The groom, along with the bride's party goes to the bride's house. A ritual named ''Akshat'' is performed in which people around the groom and bride throw ''haldi'' (turmeric) and ''sindur'' (vermilion) colored rice grains on the couple. After the ''Kanyadan'' ceremony, there is an exchange of garlands between the bride and the groom. Then, the groom ties the Mangalsutra around the neck of the bride. This is followed by ''granthibandhan'' in which the end of the bride's ''sari'' is tied to the end of the groom's dhoti, and a feast is arranged at the groom's place.'

Elements of a traditional Marathi Hindu wedding ceremony include ''seemant poojan'' on the wedding eve. The ''dharmic'' wedding includes the ''antarpat'' ceremony followed by the vedic ceremony which involves the bridegroom and the bride walking around the sacred fire seven times to complete the marriage. Modern urban wedding ceremonies conclude with an evening reception. A Marathi Hindu woman becomes part of her husband's family after marriage and adopts the gotra as well as the traditions of her husband's family.{{#tag:ref|Until about 300 BC, Hindu men were about 24 years of age when they got married and the girl was always post-pubescent.{{sfn|Nagi|1993|pp=6–9}} The social evil of child marriage established itself in Hindu society sometime after 300 BC as a response to foreign invasions.{{sfn|Nagi|1993|pp=7}} The problem was first addressed in 1860 by amending the Indian Penal Code which required the boy's age to be 14 and the girl's age to be 12 at minimum, for a marriage to be considered legal. In 1927, the Hindu Child Marriage Act made a marriage between a boy under 15 and a girl under 12 illegal. This minimum age requirement was increased to 14 for girls and 18 for boys in 1929. It was again increased by a year for girls in 1948. The Act was amended again in 1978 when the ages were raised to 18 for girls and 21 for boys.{{sfn|Nagi|1993|pp=9}}|group=note}}

After weddings and after thread ceremonies, many Maratha and Deshastha Brahmin families arrange a traditional religious singing performance by a Gondali group {{sfn|Zelliot|Berntsen|1988|pp=176}}

Decades ago, girls used to get married to the groom of their parents' choice by their early teens or before. Even today, girls are married off in their late teens by rural and less educated people. Urban women may choose to remain unmarried until the late 20s or even early 30s.

Marathi Hindu people dispose their dead by [[Antyesti|cremation]].{{sfn|Ghosal|2004|p=479}} The deceased's son carries the corpse to the cremation ground atop a [[bier]]. The eldest son lights the fire for the corpse at the head for males and at the feet for females. The ashes are gathered in an earthen pitcher and immersed in a river on the third day after death. This is a 13-day ritual with the ''pinda'' being offered to the dead soul on the 11th and a ''[[Śrāddha]]'' ceremony followed by a funeral feast on the 13th. Cremation is performed according to vedic rites, usually within a day of the individual's death. Like all other Hindus, the preference is for the ashes to be immersed in the [[Ganges]] river or [[Godavari River|Godavari]] river. ''Śrāddha'' becomes an annual ritual in which all forefathers of the family who have passed on are remembered. These rituals are expected to be performed only by male descendants, preferably the eldest son of the deceased.

[[File:Gudi.jpg|thumb|252x252px|A [[Gudi Padwa|Gudhi]] is erected on Gudhi Padva.]]
The first day of the [[Hindu Calendar|Hindu month]] of [[Chaitra]] (March - April)) is celebrated as Marathi New Year.

Marathi Hindus celebrate most of the Indian Hindu festivals such as [[Navratri|Dasara]], [[Diwali]] and [[Raksha Bandhan]]. These are, however, celebrated with certain Maharashtrian regional variations. Others festivals like [[Ganesh Chaturthi|Ganeshotsav]] have a more characteristic Marathi flavour. The Marathi, [[Kannada people|Kannada]] and [[Telugu people]] follow the Deccan [[Shalivahana]] [[Hindu calendar]], which may have subtle differences with calendars followed by other communities in India. The festivals described below are in a chronological order as they occur during a Shaka year, starting with Shaka new year festival of [[Gudhi Padwa]].&lt;ref&gt;Betham, R.M., 1908.

This is one of the three-and-a-half most auspicious days in the Hindu Calendar and usually occurs in the month of April. In the [[Vidharbha]] region, this festival is celebrated in remembrance of the departed members of the family. The upper castes feed a Brahmin and married couple on this day. The [[Mahar]]s community used to celebrate it by offering food to crows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lall|first1=R.

Married women visit a nearby tree and worship it by tying red threads of love around it. They pray for well-being and a long life for their husband.
[[File:Palkhi Near Saswad.JPG|thumb|right|Dnyaneshwar palkhi on its way to Pandharpur]]
* [[Ashadhi Ekadashi]]: [[Shayani Ekadashi|Ashadhi Ekadashi]] (11th day of the month of [[Ashadha]], (falls in July–early August of [[Gregorian calendar]]) is closely associated with the Marathi ''[[Sant (religion)|sant]]''s [[Dnyaneshwar]], [[Tukaram]] and others. Twenty days before this day, thousands of [[Varkari]]s start their pilgrimage to [[Pandharpur]] from the resting places of the saint. For example, in the case of Dynaneshwar, it starts from [[Alandi]] with Dynaneshwar's ''paduka'' (symbolic sandals made out of wood) in a ''Palakhi''. Varkaris carry ''tals'' or small cymbals in their hand, wear [[Hindu prayer beads]] made from ''[[Ocimum tenuiflorum|tulasi]]'' around their necks and sing and dance to the devotional hymns and prayers to [[Vitthala]]. People all over Maharashtra fast on this day and offer prayers in the temples. This day marks the start of [[Chaturmas]] (The four [[monsoon]] months, from [[Asharh|Ashadh]] to [[Kartik (month)|Kartik]]) according to the [[Hindu calendar]]. This is one of the most important fasting days for Marathi Hindu people.
* [[Guru Purnima|Guru Pournima]]: The full moon day of the month of [[Ashadha|Ashadh]] is celebrated as [[Guru Purnima|Guru Pournima]]. For Hindus ''Guru-Shishya'' (teacher-student) tradition is very important, be it educational or spiritual. Gurus are often equated with God and always regarded as a link between the individual and the immortal. On this day spiritual aspirants and devotees worship Maharshi [[Vyasa]], who is regarded as [[Guru]] of Gurus.
* Divyanchi Amavasya: The new moon day/last day of the month of Ashadh/आषाढ (falls between June and July of Gregorian Calendar) is celebrated as Divyanchi Amavasya. This new moon signifies the end of the month of Ashadh, and the arrival of the month of [[Shravan]], which is considered the most pious month of the Hindu calendar. On this day, all the traditional lamps of the house are cleaned and fresh wicks are put in. The lamps are then lit and worshiped. People cook a specific item called ''diva'' (literally lamp), prepared by steaming sweet wheat dough batter and shaping it like little lamps. They are eaten warm with ghee.
* [[Nag Panchami]]: One of the many festivals in India during which Marathi people celebrate and worship nature. ''Nags'' ([[cobra]]s) are worshiped on the fifth day of the month of Shravan (around August) in the Hindu calendar. On Nagpanchami Day, people draw a ''nag'' family depicting the male and female snake and their nine offspring or ''nagkul''. The ''nag'' family is worshiped and a bowl of milk and wet ''chandan'' (sandalwood powder) offered. It is believed that the ''nag'' deity visits the household, enjoys languishing in the moist ''chandan'', drinks the milk offering, and blesses the household with good luck. Women put temporary [[henna]] tattoos (''[[mehndi]]'') on their hand on the previous day, and buy new bangles on Nagpanchami Day. According to folklore, people refrain from digging the soil, cutting vegetables, frying and roasting on a hot plate on this day, while farmers do not harrow their farms to prevent any accidental injury to snakes. In a small village named [[Battis Shirala]] in Maharashtra a big snake festival is held which attracts thousands of tourists from all over the world. In other parts of Maharashtra, snake charmers are seen sitting by the roadsides or moving from one place to another with their baskets holding snakes. While playing the lingering melodious notes on their [[pungi]], they beckon devotees with their calls—''Nagoba-la dudh de Mayi'' ('Give milk to the cobra oh mother!'). Women offer sweetened milk, popcorn (''lahya'' in Marathi) made out of jwari/dhan/corns to the snakes and pray. Cash and old clothes are also given to the snake-charmers. In [[Barshi]] Town in the Solapur district, a big ''jatra'' (carnival) is held at Nagoba Mandir in Tilak chowk.
* [[Raksha Bandhan|Narali Purnima]] or [[Narali Purnima]]: is celebrated on the full moon day of the month of [[Shravan]] in the Shaka Hindu calendar (around August). This is the most important festival for the coastal [[Konkan]] region because the new season for fishing starts on this day. Fishermen and women offer coconuts to the sea and ask for a peaceful season while praying for the sea to remain calm. The same day is celebrated as [[Raksha Bandhan|Rakhi Pournima]] to commemorate the abiding ties between brother and sister in Maharashtra as well other parts of Northern India. ''Narali bhaat'' (sweet rice with coconut) is the main dish on this day. On this day, Brahmin men change their [[sacred thread]] (''Janve''; Marathi: जानवे) at a common gathering ceremony called Shraavani (Marathi:श्रावणी).
[[File:Govindashtami.jpg|thumb|right|Gukulashtami dahi-handi celebration]]
* [[Gokul Ashtami]]: The birthday of [[Krishna]] is celebrated with great fervour all over India on the eighth day of second fortnight of the month Shravan (usually in the month of August). In Maharashtra, Gokul Ashtami is synonymous with the ceremony of ''[[dahi handi]]''. This is a reenactment of Krishna's efforts to steal butter from a ''matka'' (earthen pot) suspended from the ceiling. Large earthen pots filled with milk, curds, butter, honey, fruits etc. are suspended at a height of between {{convert|20|and|40|ft}} in the streets. Teams of young men and boys come forward to claim this prize. They construct a human pyramid by standing on each other's shoulders until the pyramid is tall enough to enable the topmost person to reach the pot and claim the contents after breaking it. Currency notes are often tied to the rope by which the pot is suspended. The prize money is distributed among those who participate in the pyramid building. The ''dahi-handi'' draws a huge crowd and they support the teams trying to grab these pots by chanting 'Govinda ala re ala'.
* Mangala Gaur: Pahili Mangala Gaur (first Mangala Gaur) is one of the most important celebrations for the new brides amongst [[Deshastha Brahmin|Marathi Brahmins]]. On the Tuesday of the month of the Shravan falling within a year after her marriage, the new bride performs [[Lingam|Shivling]] puja for the well-being of her husband and new family. It is also a get-together of all womenfolk. It includes chatting, playing games, ''ukhane'' (married women take their husband's name woven in 2/4 rhyming liners) and sumptuous food. They typically play zimma, fugadi, bhendya (more popularly known as [[Antakshari]] in modern India) until the early hours of the following morning.

[[File:Pola in Chinawal 1.jpg|thumb|right|Oxen decorated for Pola in a village.]]
* [[Pola (festival)|Bail Pola]]: the festival is celebrated on the new moon day (Pithori Amavasya) of the month of Shravan (August - September), to honor farm [[ox]]en for their service. On this day the oxen are decorated by their owners and taken around the village in a parade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Edward Balfour|title=The Cyclopædia of India and of Eastern and Southern Asia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iU0OAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA241|year=1885|publisher=B.

A lavishly decorated form of Parvati, Gauri is venerated as the mother of Ganesha. Women fast on this day and worship [[Shiva]] and [[Parvati]] in the evening with green leaves. Women wear green bangles and green clothes and stay awake till midnight. Both married and unmarried women may observe this fast.
[[File:Ganpati_at_Pune.JPG|alt=Head of a statue of Ganesha|thumb|238x238px|[[Ganesha]] idol in [[Pune]], Maharashtra]]
* [[Ganeshotsav]]: This 11-day festival starts on [[Ganesh Chaturthi]] on the fourth day of [[Bhadrapada]] in honour of Ganesha, the God of wisdom. Hindu households install in their house, Ganesha idols made out of clay called ''shadu'' and painted in watercolours. Early in the morning on this day, the clay idols of Ganesha are brought home while chanting ''Ganpati Bappa Morya'' and installed on decorated platforms. The idol is worshiped in the morning and evening with offerings of flowers, [[Cynodon dactylon|durva]](strands of young grass), [[Gujia|karanji]] and [[modak]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is the significance of 'durva' in Ganesh Poojan ? |url=http://www.sanatan.org/en/a/69_durva.html|website=Sanatan.org|accessdate=3 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Durva&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sharma|first1=Usha|title=Festivals In Indian Society (2 Vols.

Domestic celebrations end after {{frac|1|1|2}}, 3, 5, 7 or 11 days. At that time the idol is ceremoniously brought to a body of water (such as a lake, river or the sea) for immersion. In Maharashtra, Ganeshotsav also incorporates other festivals, namely [[Teej|Hartalika]] and the Gauri festival, the former is observed with a fast by women on the day before Ganesh Chaturthi, while the latter by the installation of idols of Gauris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pattanaik|first1=Devdutt|title=99 thoughts on Ganesha : [stories, symbols and rituals of India's beloved elephant-headed deity]|date=2011|publisher=Jaico Pub House|location=Mumbai|isbn=978-81-8495-152-3|page=61|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=Wh22qvzQuowC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PP9&amp;dq=gauri+ganpati+festival+marathi&amp;ots=U-uTBVkzqT&amp;sig=DHrfR9hOkncpSqkybq_WMurKBN4#v=onepage&amp;q=gauri&amp;f=false|accessdate=29 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1894, Nationalist leader [[Lokmanya Tilak]] turned this festival into a public event as a means of uniting people toward the common goal of campaigning against British colonial rule. The public festival lasts for 11 days with various cultural programmes including music concerts, orchestra, plays, and skits. Some social activities are also undertaken during this period like blood donation, scholarships for the needy, or donations to people suffering from any kind of natural calamity. Due to environmental concerns, a number of families now avoid bodies of water, and let the clay statue disintegrate in a barrel of water at home. After a few days, the clay is spread in the home garden. In some cities, a public, eco-friendly process is used for the immersion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Zha|first=Bagish K.|title=Eco-friendly 'Ganesh Visarjan' save water and soil from getting polluted in Indore|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/environment/pollution/Eco-friendly-Ganesh-Visarjan-save-water-and-soil-from-getting-polluted-in-Indore/articleshow/22808957.cms|accessdate=12 February 2014|newspaper=The Times of India|date=20 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Gauri / Mahalakshmi: Along with Ganesha, [[Parvati|Gauri]] (also known as Mahalaxmi in the Vidharbha region of Maharashtra) festival is celebrated in Maharashtra. On the first day of the three-day festival, Gauris arrive home, the next day they eat lunch with a variety of sweets, and on the third day they return to their home. Gauris arrive in a pair, one as ''Jyeshta'' (the Elder one) and another as ''Kanishta'' (the Younger one). They are treated with love since they represent the daughters arriving at their parents' home. In many parts of Maharashtra including Marathwada and Vidarbha, this festival is called [[Mahalakshmi]] or Mahalakshmya or simply Lakshmya.
* [[Anant Chaturdashi]]: The 11th day of the Ganesh festival (14th day of the month of Bhadrapada) is celebrated as [[Anant Chaturdashi]], which marks the end of the celebration. People bid a tearful farewell to the God by immersing the installed idols from home/public places in water and chanting 'Ganapati Bappa Morya, pudhchya warshi Lawakar ya!!' ('Ganesha, come early next year.') Some people also keep the traditional wow (Vrata) of Ananta Pooja. This involves the worship of Ananta the coiled snake or Shesha on which Vishnu resides. A delicious mixture of 14 vegetables is prepared as ''naivedyam'' on this day.
* [[Navratri]] and Ghatsthapana: Starting with the first day of the month of Ashvin in the Hindu calendar (around the month of October), the nine-day and -night festival immediately preceding the most important festival [[Vijayadashami|Dasara]] is celebrated all over India with different traditions. In Maharashtra, on the first day of this 10-day festival, idols of the Goddess [[Durga]] are ritually installed at many homes. This installation of the Goddess is popularly known as Ghatsthapana.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rodrigues|first1=Hillary Peter|title=Ritual worship of the great goddess : the liturgy of the Durgā Pūjā with interpretations|date=2003|publisher=State University of New York Press|location=Albany, NY|isbn=9780791454008|page=86|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=onyaEhwhJBUC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:भोंडला.jpg|right|thumb|Women performing Bhondla dance during the festival of Navratri]]
During this period, girls and women perform 'Bhondla/Hadga' as the Sun moves to the thirteenth constellation of the zodiac called 'Hasta' (Elephant). During the nine days, Bhondla (also known as 'Bhulabai' in the Vidarbha region of Maharashtra) is celebrated in the garden or on the terrace during evening hours by inviting female friends of the daughter in the house. An elephant is drawn either with [[Rangoli]] on the soil or with a chalk on a slate and kept in the middle. The girls go around it in a circle, holding each other's hands and singing Bhondla songs. All Bhondla songs are traditional songs passed down through the generations. The last song typically ends with the words '...khirapatila kaay ga?' ('What is the special dish today?'). This 'Khirapat' is a special dish, or dishes, often made laboriously by the mother of the host girl. The food is served only after the rest of the girls have correctly guessed what the covered dish or dishes are. There are some variations with how the Navratri festival is celebrated. For example, in many Brahmin families, celebrations include offering lunch for nine days to a specially invited a group of guests. The guests include a married Woman (Marathi:सवाष्ण ), a Brahmin and, a Virgin (Marathi:कुमारिका). In the morning and evening, the head of the family ritually worships either the goddess [[Durga]], [[Lakshmi]] or [[Saraswati]]. On the eighth day, a special rite is carried out in some families. A statue of the goddess Mahalakshmi, with the face of a rice mask, is prepared and worshiped by newly married girls. In the evening of that day, women blow into earthen or metallic pots as a form of worship to please the goddess. Everyone in the family accompanies them by chanting verses and [[Bhajans]]. The nine-day festival ends with a [[Yagna]] or reading of a Hindu Holy book (Marathi:पारायण ).

* [[Vijayadashami|Dasara]]: This festival is celebrated on the tenth day of the Ashvin month (around October) according to the Hindu Calendar. This is one of the three-and-a-half most auspicious days in the Hindu Lunar calendar when every moment is important. On the last day (Dasara day), the idols installed on the first day of the [[Navratri]] are immersed in water. This day also marks the victory of [[Rama]] over [[Ravana]]. People visit each other and exchange sweets. On this day, people worship the [[Bauhinia racemosa|Aapta tree]] &lt;ref&gt;Kolte, R.R., Kulkarni, R.S., Shinde, P.V., Padvekar, H.K., Magadum, V.G. and Apate, S.A., Studies on the ethno-medicinal plants used on the occasion of festivals with special reference to Ratnagiri district from Maharashtra state.[https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Vishal_Magadum/publication/308791976_Studies_on_the_ethno-medicinal_plants_used_on_the_occasion_of_festivals_with_special_reference_to_Ratnagiri_district_from_Maharashtra_state/links/57f21d0808ae91deaa561f5c/Studies-on-the-ethno-medicinal-plants-used-on-the-occasion-of-festivals-with-special-reference-to-Ratnagiri-district-from-Maharashtra-state.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; and exchange its leaves (known as golden leaves) and wish each other a future like gold. There is a legend involving [[Raghu]]raja, an ancestor of Rama, the Aapta tree and [[Kuber]]. There is also another legend about the Shami tree where the [[Pandava]] hid their weapons during their exile.
* Kojagari: Written in the short form of [[Sanskrit]] as 'Ko Jagarti (को जागरति) ?' ( [[Sandhi]] of 'कः जागरति,' meaning 'Who is awake?'), [[Kojagiri]] is celebrated on the full moon day of the month of [[Ashwin]]. It is said that on this Kojagiri night, the Goddess [[Lakshmi]] visits every house asking 'Ko Jagarti?' and blesses those who are awake with fortune and prosperity. To welcome the Goddess, houses, temples, streets, etc. are illuminated. People get together on this night, usually in open spaces (e.g. in gardens or on terraces), and play games until midnight. At that hour, after seeing the reflection of the full moon in milk boiled with [[saffron]] and various varieties of dry fruits, they drink the concoction. The eldest child in the household is honoured on this day.[[File:दिवाळी किल्ला.jpg|right|thumb|A replica fort made by children at Diwali]]
* [[Diwali]]: Just like most other parts of India, Diwali is one of the most popular Hindu festivals. Houses are illuminated for the festival with rows of clay lamps and decorated with [[rangoli]] and aakash kandils (decorative lanterns of different shapes and sizes). Diwali is celebrated with new clothes, firecrackers and a variety of sweets in the company of family and friends. In Maharashtrian tradition, during days of Diwali, family members have a ritual bath before dawn and then sit down for a breakfast of fried sweets and savory snacks. These sweets and snacks are offered to visitors to the house during the multi-day festival and exchanged with neighbors. Typical sweet preparations include ''[[Laddu|Ladu]]'', ''[[Anarsa|Anarse]]'', [[Shankarpali]], and ''[[Dumpling|Karanjya]]''. Popular savory treats include ''[[chakli]]'', ''shev,'' and ''[[chiwda]]''.&lt;ref name="Edmund2001"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Edmund W. Lusas |author2=Lloyd W.

* Kartiki Ekadashi and Tulshicha Lagna: The 11th day of the month of Kartik marks the end of [[Chaturmas]] and is called Kartiki Ekadashi (also known as [[Prabodhini Ekadashi]]). On this day, Hindus, particularly the followers of Vishnu, celebrate his awakening after a [[Yoganidra]] of four months of [[Chaturmas]]. People worship him and fast for the entire day. The same evening, or the evening of the next day, is marked by Tulsi Vivah (Tulshicha Lagna). The [[Tulsi]] (Holy Basil plant) is held sacred by the Hindus as it is regarded as an incarnation of Mahalaxmi who was born as Vrinda. The end of Diwali celebrations mark the beginning of Tulshicha Lagna. Maharashtrians organise the marriage of a sacred Tulsi plant in their house with Krishna. On this day the Tulshi vrindavan is coloured and decorated as a bride. Sugarcane and branches of [[tamarind]] and [[Indian gooseberry|amla]] trees are planted along with the tulsi plant. Though a mock marriage, all the ceremonies of an actual Maharashtrian marriage are conducted including chanting of [[mantra]]s, [[Mangal Ashtaka]] and tying of [[Mangal Sutra]] to the Tulshi. Families and friends gather for this marriage ceremony, which usually takes place in the late evening. Various ''pohe'' dishes are offered to Krishna and then distributed among family members and friends. This also marks the beginning of marriage season.
The celebration lasts for three days and ends on Kartiki [[Purnima (day)|Pournima]] or Tripurari Pournima.
* [[Khandoba]] Festival/Champa Shashthi: This is a six-day festival, from the first to the sixth lunar day of the bright fortnight of the Hindu month of [[Margashirsha]]. It is celebrated in honour of [[Khandoba]] by many Marathi families. Ghatasthapana, similar to Navaratri, also takes place in households during this festival. A number of families also hold fast during this period. The fast ends on the sixth day of the festival called Champa Shashthi.&lt;ref&gt;[A HISTORY OF THE MARATHA PEOPLE, C A. KINCAID, CV.O., I.CS. AND Rao Bahadur D. B. PARASNIS, VOL II, page 314, HUMPHREY MILFORD, OXFORD UNIVERSITY PRESS LONDON BOMBAY CALCUTTA MADRAS, 1922]&lt;/ref&gt; Among some Marathi Hindu communities, the [[Chaturmas]] period ends on Champa Sashthi. As it is customary in these communities not to consume onions, garlic, and [[egg plant]] (Brinjal / Aubergine) during the Chaturmas, the consumption of these food items resumes with ritual preparation of Bharit ([[Baingan Bharta]]) and ''rodga'', small round flat bread prepared from ''jwari'' (white [[millet]]).
* [[Bhogi]]: The eve of the Hindu festival '[[Makar Sankranti]]' and the day before is called Bhogi. Bhogi is a festival of happiness and enjoyment and generally takes place on 13 January. It is celebrated in honour of Indra, 'the God of Clouds and Rains'. Indra is worshiped for the abundance of the harvest, which brings plenty and prosperity to the land. Since it is held in the winter, the main food for Bhogi is mixed vegetable curry made with carrots, lima beans, green [[capsicum]]s, [[Drumstick (vegetable)|drumsticks]], [[green beans]] and peas. Bajra roti (i.e. roti made of [[pearl millet]]) topped with sesame as well as rice and ''mung dal khichadi'' are eaten to keep warm in winter. During this festival people also take baths with sesame seeds.

* [[Makar Sankranti]]: Sankraman means the passing of the sun from one zodiac sign to the next. This day marks the sun's passage from the Tropic of Dhanu ([[Sagittarius (astrology)|Sagittarius]]) to Makar ([[Capricorn (astrology)|Capricorn]]). Makar Sankranti falls on 14 January in non-leap years and on 15 January in leap years. It is the only Hindu festival that is based on the solar calendar rather than the [[Lunar calendar]]. Maharashtrians exchange tilgul or sweets made of jaggery and sesame seeds along with the customary salutation, ''Tilgul ghya aani god bola'', which means 'Accept the Tilgul and be friendly'. ''Tilgul Poli'' or ''gulpoli'' are the main sweet preparations made on the day in Maharashtra. It is a wheat-based flat bread filled with [[sesame seed]]s and [[jaggery]].,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Naik*|first1=S.N.|last2=Prakash|first2=Karnika|title=Bioactive Constituents as a Potential Agent in Sesame for Functional and Nutritional Application|journal=JOURNAL OF BIORESOURCE ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY|date=2014|volume=2|issue=4|pages=42–60}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sen|first1=Colleen Taylor|title=Food culture in India|date=2004|publisher=Greenwood|location=Westport, Conn.[u.a.]|isbn=978-0313324871|page=142|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YIyV_5wrplMC&amp;pg=PA41&amp;dq=bhakri&amp;ei=yXaQSdHyG4qUkQSJ6KzIBQ&amp;client=firefox-a#v=snippet&amp;q=maharashtra%20SESAME&amp;f=false|accessdate=31 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Maha Shivratri]]: Maha Shivratri (also known as Maha Sivaratri, Shivaratri or Sivarathri) means 'Great Night of Shiva' or 'Night of Shiva'. It is a Hindu festival celebrated every year on the 13th night and 14th day of [[Hindu calendar#Tithi|Krishna Paksha]] (waning moon) of the month of [[Maagha]] (as per ''Shalivahana'' or ''Gujarati Vikrama'') or [[Phalguna]] (as per ''Vikrama'') in the Hindu Calendar, that is, the night before and day of the new moon. The festival is principally celebrated by offerings of [[bael]] (bilva) leaves to Shiva, all day fasting, and an all night long vigil. The fasting food on this day includes [[chutney]] prepared with the pulp of the kavath fruit (''[[Limonia (plant)|Limonia]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Deshmukh|first1=B.

* [[Holi]] and Rangapanchami: The festival of Holi falls in Falgun, the last month of the Marathi Shaka calendar. Marathi people celebrate this festival by lighting a bonfire and offering ''puran poli'' to the fire. In North India, Holi is celebrated over two days with the second day celebrated with throwing colours. In Maharashtra it is known as Dhuli Vandan. However, Maharashtrians celebrate color throwing five days after Holi on Rangpanchami. In Maharashtra, people make [[puran poli]] as the ritual offering to the holy fire.&lt;ref name="Taylor Sen 2014 p. 105"&gt;Taylor Sen, Colleen (2014). Feasts and Fasts A History of Indian Food.

=== Festivals observed by other communities ===
==== Dhamma Chakra Pravartan Din ====
On 14 October 1956 at [[Nagpur]], Maharashtra, India, Dr. [[Babasaheb Ambedkar]] embraced Buddhist religion publicly and gave Deeksha of Buddhist religion to his more than 380,000 followers.&lt;ref&gt;This was Ambedkar's own figure given by him in a letter to [[Devapriya Valishinha]] dated 30 October 1956. ''The Maha Bodhi'' Vol. 65, p.226, quoted in [http://www.sangharakshita.org/_books/Ambedkar_and_Buddhism.pdf Dr. Ambedkar and Buddhism] by [[Sangharakshita]].&lt;/ref&gt; The day is celebrated as [[Dharmacakra]] Pravartan Din. The grounds in Nagpur on which the conversion ceremony took place is known as [[Deekshabhoomi]]. Every year more than million Buddhist people especially [[Dalit Buddhist movement|
Ambedkarite]] from all over the world visit Deekshabhoomi to commemorate Dhamma Chakra Pravartan Din.&lt;ref name="COLLECTOR"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nagpur.nic.in/zpnagpur/English/Tourism1.htm |title=Places to Visit |last= |first= |date= |website= |publisher=District Collector Office, Nagpur Official Website |access-date= |accessdate= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130521005841/http://nagpur.nic.in/zpnagpur/English/Tourism1.htm |archivedate=21 May 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Christmas ====
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2016}}

[[Christmas]] is celebrated to mark the birthday of [[Jesus Christ]]. Like in other parts of India, Christmas is celebrated with zeal by a large number of Marathi people, both Christians and non-Christians. Owing to the Portuguese influence on Maharashtra, Christmas is also known as 'Naataal' (Marathi:नाताळ), a word similar to 'Natal' used in Portuguese.

=== Food ===

[[File:Bhaji-Bhakari.jpg|thumb|right|A typical simple Maharashtrian meal with bhaaji, bhakari, raw onion and pickle]]

The many communities in Marathi society result in a diverse cuisine. This diversity extends to the family level because each family uses its own unique combination of spices. The majority of Maharashtrians do eat meat and eggs, but the Brahmin community is mostly [[lacto-vegetarian]]. The traditional staple food on Desh (the Deccan plateau) is usually ''[[bhakri]]'', spiced cooked vegetables, ''[[dal]]'' and rice. Bhakri is an [[unleavened bread]] made using Indian millet (''[[jowar]]''), [[Pearl millet|''bajra'']] or ''bajri''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Khatau|first=Asha|title=Epicure S Vegetarian CuisinesJOf India|year=2004|publisher=Popular Prakashan ltd.|location=Mumbai|isbn=81-7991-119-5|page=57|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=16mU1bzJx3AC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA15&amp;dq=bhakri+maharashtra+recipe&amp;ots=rKODCatGKV&amp;sig=x6AIbOep6xBF0GrDFcCA05B-iWs#v=onep}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the North Maharashtrians and Urban people prefer [[roti]], which is a plain bread made with [[wheat]] flour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Reejhsinghani|first1=Aroona|title=Delights From Maharashtra|date=2007|publisher=Jaico;|isbn=978-8172245184|edition=7th|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=RwMRaDxJcWwC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PT10#v=onepage&amp;q=amti&amp;f=false|accessdate=12 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the coastal Konkan region, rice is the traditional staple food. An aromatic variety of ''[[ambemohar]]'' rice is more popular amongst Marathi people than the internationally known [[basmati]] rice. Malvani dishes use more wet coconut and coconut milk in their preparation. In the Vidarbha region, little coconut is used in daily preparations but dry coconut, along with peanuts, is used in dishes such as spicy ''[[savji]]''s or mutton and chicken dishes.

''Thalipeeth'' is a popular traditional breakfast flat bread that is prepared using ''bhajani'', a mixture of many different varieties of roasted lentils.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Epicure S Vegetarian Cuisines Of India|last=|first=|publisher=Mumbai: Popular Prakashan ltd. p. 63.|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marathi Hindu people observe fasting days when traditional staple food like rice and chapatis are avoided. However, milk products and non-native foods such as potatoes, peanuts and ''[[sabudana]]'' preparations (''sabudana khicdi'') are allowed, which result in a carbohydrate rich alternative fasting cuisine.

Some Maharashtrian dishes including ''sev bhaji'', ''misal pav'' and ''patodi'' are distinctly regional dishes within Maharashtra.

In metropolitan areas including Mumbai and Pune, the pace of life makes fast food very popular. The most popular forms of fast food amongst Marathi people in these areas are: ''[[Pakora|bhaji]]'', ''[[vada pav]]'', ''[[Misal Pav|misal pav]]'' and ''[[pav bhaji]]''. More traditional dishes are ''[[Sabudana Khichadi|sabudana khichdi]]'', ''[[pohe]]'', ''[[upma]]'', ''[[sheera]]'' and ''[[panipuri]]''. Most Marathi fast food and snacks are purely lacto-vegetarian in nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/oct/03/vada-pav-sandwich-recipe-potato-chutney|title="Vada pav sandwich recipe"|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited.|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/features/magazine/article3657300.ece|title="In search of Mumbai Vada Pav"|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=The Hindu|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In South Konkan, near [[Malvan]], an independent exotic cuisine has developed called [[Malvani cuisine]], which is predominantly non-vegetarian. ''[[Kombdi vade]]'', fish preparations and baked preparations are more popular here. [[Kombdi Vade]], is a recipe from the Konkan region. Deep fried flat bread made from spicy rice and [[Vigna mungo|urid]] flour served with chicken curry, more specifically with Malvani chicken curry.

Desserts are an important part of Marathi food and include ''[[puran poli]]'', ''[[shrikhand]]'', ''[[basundi]]'', ''[[kheer]]'', ''[[gulab jamun]]'', and ''[[modak]]''. Traditionally, these desserts were associated with a particular festival, for example, ''modak''s are prepared during the [[Ganpati|Ganpati Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=LSTRAQAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PT36&amp;dq=marathi+wedding+recipe+alu&amp;ots=xcaz2eb6Ua&amp;sig=Q4ee8GFDBDtlW6x4L2nBYTjeOYk&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=mo&amp;f=false|title=SAVOUR MUMBAI: A CULINARY JOURNEY THROUGH INDIA’S MELTING POT|last=|first=|page=36|website=Books.google.com|access-date=2017-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Names===
Marathi Hindu people follow a partially [[Patronymic]] naming system.For example, it is customary to associate the father's name with the given name. In the case of married women, the husband's name is associated with the given name. Therefore, the constituents of a Marathi name as given name /first name, father/husband, family name /surname. For example:
* [[Mahadeo Govind Ranade]]: Here Mahadeo is the given name, Govind is his father's given the name and Ranade is the surname.
* Jyotsna Mukund Khandekar: Here Jyotsna is the given name, Mukund is the husband's given name, and Khandekar is the surname of the husband&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sharma|first1=D.D.|title=Panorama of Indian anthroponomy : (an historical, socio-cultural &amp; linguistic analysis of Indian personal names|date=2005|publisher=Mittal Publications|location=New Delhi, India|isbn=9788183240789|page=192|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=a4rccspy46sC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR5&amp;dq=%22hindu+personal+names%22+&amp;ots=zkCs_xltKp&amp;sig=qzuhYiqFn1nlOZJK9pxm_jo0xi4#v=onepage&amp;q=%22hindu%20personal%20names%22%20maharashtra&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A large number of Maharashtrian surnames are derived by adding the suffix ''kar'' to the village from which the family originally hailed.{{sfn|Chopra|1982|p=52}} For example, Junnarkar came from town of [[Junnar]], Waghulkar comes from the town of Waghul.

==== Ancient Marathi inscriptions ====
Marathi, also known as Suena at that time, was the court language during the reign of the [[Yadava Dynasty|Yadava Kings]]. Yadava king Singhania was known for his magnanimous donations. Inscriptions recording these donations are found written in Marathion on stone slabs in the temple at Kolhapur in Maharashtra. Composition of noted works of scholars like [[Hemadri]] are also found. Hemadri was also responsible for introducing a style of architecture called Hemandpanth.{{ref|1}} Among the various stone inscriptions are those found at Akshi in the Kolaba district, which are the first known stone inscriptions in Marathi. An example found at the bottom of the statue of Gomateshwar ([[Bahubali]]) at [[Shravanabelagola]] in Karnataka bears the inscription 'Chamundraye karaviyale, Gangaraye suttale karaviyale' which gives some information regarding the sculptor of the statue and the king who ordered its creation.{{ref|2}}

===== Classical literature =====
Marathi people have a long literary tradition which started in the ancient era.{{Citation needed|reason=Your explanation here|date=June 2017}} It was the 13th-century saint, [[Dnyaneshwar]] who produced the first treatise in Marathi on the Geeta. The work called [[Dnyaneshwari]] is considered a masterpiece. Along with Dnyaneshwar, his contemporary, [[Namdev]] was also responsible for propagating Marathi religious [[Bhakti]] literature.

===== Modern Marathi literature =====
The first English book was translated into Marathi in 1817 while the first Marathi newspaper started in 1841.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.printingindia.com/history/indianhistory.htm |title=Printing India |publisher=Printing India |date= |accessdate=2013-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many books on social reform were written by Baba Padamji (''Yamuna Paryatana'', 1857), [[Mahatma Jyotiba Phule]], [[Gopal Hari Deshmukh|Lokhitawadi]], [[Mahadev Govind Ranade|Justice Ranade]], and [[Hari Narayan Apte]] (1864–1919). [[Lokmanya Tilak]]'s newspaper ''[[Kesari (newspaper)|Kesari]]'' in Marathi was a strong voice in promoting Ganeshotsav or Shivaji festival. The newspaper also offered criticism of colonial government excesses. At this time, Marathi efficiently aided by Marathi Drama. [[Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar]]'s newspaper, ''Bahishkrut Bharat,'' set up in 1927, provided a platform for sharing literary views.

In the mid-1950s, the 'little magazine movement' gained momentum. It published writings which were non-conformist, radical, and experimental. The [[Dalit literature]] movement also gained strength due to the little magazine movement. This radical movement was influenced by the philosophy of non-conformity, and challenged the literary establishment, which was largely middle class, urban, and upper [[caste]].&lt;ref name=han&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=1lTnv6o-d_oC&amp;pg=PA368&amp;dq=Baburao+Bagul&amp;lr=  Issues of Language and Representation:Babu Rao Bagul] ''Handbook of twentieth-century literatures of India'', Editors: Nalini Natarajan, Emmanuel Sampath Nelson. Greenwood Publishing Group, 1996. {{ISBN|0-313-28778-3}}. '' Page 368''.&lt;/ref&gt; The little magazine movement was responsible for many excellent writers including the well-known novelist, critic, and poet [[Bhalchandra Nemade]]. Dalit writer [[N. D. Mahanor]] is well known for his work, while Dr. Sharad Rane is a well-known children's writer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nagarkar|first=Kiran|title=The Language Conflicts: The Politics and Hostilities between English and the Regional Languages in India|year=2006|url=http://www.khg.uni.wroc.pl/files/khg7nagarkart.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:NewMarkBarnes.jpg|thumb|350px|Mark Barnes]]
'''Mark Barnes''' is an American attorney serving as partner in the Ropes &amp; Gray health care practice and advocate based in Boston.  He was Director of Policy for the New York State Department of Health AIDS Institute, and Associate Commissioner for Medical and Legal Policy for the [[New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene|New York City Department of Health]] under the mayoralty of [[David Dinkins]].  He worked on the [[Health care reform|National Health Care Reform Task Force]] in the [[Clinton Administration]].  His work includes focus on the fields of research compliance, the ethics of clinical trials, and medical privacy.  He is past President of the [[New York State Bar Association]]'s [[Public health law|Health Law]] Section.

==Personal==
Barnes is a native of [[Dadeville]], [[Tallapoosa County]], [[Alabama]].&lt;ref&gt;Wylodene White, "New York reader enjoys weekly column", ''The Dadeville Record,'' May 16, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;  He is the son of Elaine Robinson and Mike Barnes, and his family has lived around Tallapoosa for generations.  According to his family oral history, he is a direct descendant of [[Daniel Boone]].&lt;ref&gt;Letters to the Editor, "The Pride of Tallapoosa", ''The New Republic,'' May 23, 1988; Barnes wrote, "Although I heard many tales from my great-grandfather, Jack Boone (a direct descendant of Daniel)...."&lt;/ref&gt;  Barnes plans to retire to Dadeville, where he purchased family property.&lt;ref&gt;''Id.''&lt;/ref&gt;  He has been with his partner since 1983.

Barnes attended [[Bennington College]].  In 1984 Barnes graduated from [[Yale Law School]] with a [[juris doctor]], and in 1991 he received his [[L.L.M.]] from [[Columbia University School of Law]].

==Legal career==
[[Image:ColumbiaStudentsLettertoDeanBlackReBarnes.jpg|thumb|In 1987 first-year Columbia students expressed appreciation of Barnes.]]In 1988, as an associate professor of the [[Columbia Law School]], Barnes founded the [[AIDS]] Law Clinic. He is a Lecturer at the Yale Medical School, where he teaches each Fall. He has also been an [[Adjunct Professor]] at a number of law schools, including [[NYU Law School]], [[Brooklyn Law School]], [[Cardozo Law School]], and [[New York Law School]]. He has taught courses in the ethics and law of human subject research, [[Public health law|healthcare law]], [[Public health law|public health]], [[Managed care|managed care law]], [[occupational health and safety]], and law and medicine.

===AIDS Law Clinic===
Barnes and Professor [[Deborah Greenberg]] at [[Columbia Law School]] founded the first legal clinic addressing the AIDS crisis, to allow law students to represent persons living with AIDS in anti-discrimination cases.&lt;ref name=Blade&gt;Kristina Campbell, "Mark Barnes wants AIDS Action Council to be a "tough presence"'', ''The Washington Blade,'' January 6, 1994&lt;/ref&gt; The program was funded in part by the [[U.S. Department of Education]] and received referrals from the New York City Commission on Human Rights and the State Division of Human Rights.  The clinical education director at Columbia said of Barnes: "[He] is a leader in the field, and we're lucky to have him. He's highly knowledgeable, he's litigated on a precedented discrimination case, and he's sensitive to the AIDS crisis."&lt;ref&gt;Tina Traster, "On the Front Lines of AIDSLaw: From Discrimination to Confidentiality, There Are Few Precedents In Any Of Their Cases", ''West Side Spirit,'' October 24, 1988, Page 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

The clinic was praised by public health officials and by students as hands-on experience, but the school did not commit to continue it. When it did not renew Barnes' contract, students protested, and the issue was covered in the press.  On April 12, 1989, 200 students protested Columbia Law School's attempts to close the "school's successful and much praised 'AIDS' legal clinic."&lt;ref&gt;John Hammond, "Students Demonstrate at Columbia; Protest Department of AIDS Clinic Co-Director," ''New York Native,'' May 1, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;  They held a sit-in at the law school building to demand the faculty committee renew Barnes's contract for another year.  "We thought one of the reasons for him not being reappointed is the lack of support for the clinic by the university," said [[Maya Wiley]], 3L and protest organizer.&lt;ref&gt;William Douglas, ''Students Stage Sit-in To Aid Law Lecturer'', New York ''Newsday,'' April 14, 1989.; Constance Hays, ''Students Protest Possible Closign of Legal Clinic'', ''The New York Times,'' April 16, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;  Dean [[Barbara Black]] said the school supported the clinic, but declined to say why Barnes was not offered another one-year contract.  Wiley said, "In all of our conversations with the powers-that-be at this school, it's been very clear to us that the clinic is in jeopardy and that there is a prevailing attitude among the powers-that-be opposed to the clinical approach." Student Matt Levine said: "We do care about Mark Barnes because he has run the clinic extremely well.  But the core issue is the continuation of the AIDS clinic."

On April 19, co-founder Deborah Green announced the school would keep the clinic open.&lt;ref&gt;D.J. Saunders, "AIDS law clinic stays," ''New York Daily News,'' April 20, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;  On June 28, 1989, the ''Columbia Spectator'' reported that Barnes was reappointed and promoted from Clinic Advisor to the Assistant Clinical Professor of Law by the faculty.&lt;ref&gt;Gerson Rothschild, ''Barnes reappointed to run Law School AIDS clinic'', ''Columbia Spectator,'' June 28, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;  "I'm gratified that the clinic will continue for an additional semester, but the challenge for the Law School is going to be the continuation of the clinic after the fall semester," said Barnes.

==Public service==
In 1989, Barnes began working as the AIDS policy director for the New York State Department of Health. The appointment was criticized by an activist with [[ACT UP]]/Washington, who said that Barnes' appointment was a "commitment to mediocrity" and that a director living with AIDS should have been chosen.&lt;ref name =Blade&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1992, he was appointed associate commissioner for medical and legal policy at the [[New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene|New York City Department of Health]].  He was appointed by then-[[United States Department of Health and Human Services|Health and Human Services Secretary]] [[Donna Shalala]] to the new [[National Human Research Protections Advisory Committee]], which examined issues of ethical conduct in [[Human experimentation|human medical experimentation]].&lt;ref&gt;New York Law Journal, ''Today's News: Update'', January 4, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;  Barnes participated in the first-ever White House Conference on HIV and AIDS on December 6, 1995.  He has been a consultant for the National Commission on AIDS, the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]], the [[American Red Cross]], and the [[National Minority Task Force on AIDS]]. In 2012 he co-founded, and continues to serve as faculty co-chair of, the Multi-Regional Clinical Trials Center of Harvard University and Brigham and Women’s Hospital, a project designed to improve the planning, conduct and regulation of multi-national clinical trials, with a special emphasis on trials in the emerging economies. In 2004, he was the founding executive director of the Harvard University AIDS treatment programs in Nigeria, Tanzania and Botswana funded under the PEPFAR program. In 1992, while serving as the associate commissioner of the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, he wrote and managed the adoption of new health regulations that allowed the public health authorities to detain and treat patients with tuberculosis who had failed to take their anti-tuberculosis medications, reducing the rise of multi-drug resistant tuberculosis in New York City in the early 1990s.

*"Simple block-granting without tough federal oversight and high standards, of Medicaid or anything else, does not serve the common good.

*"Once the administration failed [to veto the Defense Authorization bill], it is easier to see why the [[Bill Clinton|president]]--who is rumored to be furious at his own staff for this ineptitude--felt compelled to sign it.  After all, his own staff had negotiated its final form."&lt;ref&gt;Letter to the editor, [[The New Republic]], March 18, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5849">'''Mary Esther Harding''' (1888&amp;ndash;1971) was a British-[[United States|American]] [[Jungian]] analyst who was the first significant [[Jungian psychology|Jungian]] [[psychoanalyst]] in the [[United States]].

==Personal life==
Mary Esther Harding was born in [[Shropshire]], [[England]] as the fourth of six daughters of a dental surgeon. She was an avid reader and was home schooled until the age of eleven. Pursuing her goal of becoming a missionary doctor, she attended the [[London School of Medicine for Women]], where she graduated in 1914 in a class of nine students. She was then an intern at the [[Royal London Hospital|Royal Infirmary in London]], the first hospital in [[London]] to accept women interns. At that time she wrote her first book, The ''Circulatory Failure of Diphtheria'' and later herself contracted the [[Diphtheria|disease]]. After her recovery a friend named Constance Long gave her [[Beatrice Hinkle]]'s translation of ''[[Psychology of the Unconscious]]'' by [[Carl Gustav Jung]], which led her to move to [[Switzerland]] and enter analysis with him, along with a small group of other students attending Jung's [[Küsnacht]] home near [[Zurich]].

==Psychoanalyst==
In 1919, Eleanor Bertine and [[Kristine Mann]] traveled to [[Zurich]] following an International Conference of Medical Women. Eleanor Bertine and Esther Harding developed a close relationship there and, in 1924, decided to relocate to [[New York City]]. Each year they would travel to Zurich for two months of analysis and spend summers at [[Bailey Island (Maine)|Bailey Island]], [[Maine]], the ancestral summer home of Kristine Mann. There they saw analysands from the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] in a quiet, comfortable setting away from the distractions of daily life and conducive to profound experiences of the unconscious.

==Jungian Community==
Mary Esther Harding became influential in the New York City Jungian [[Analytical psychology]] community. She was a prodigious writer and a frequent lecturer in the United States and Canada. Her first book on analytical psychology, entitled ''The Way of All Women'', was an instant-best seller and has been translated into many languages and introduced many people to Jung's psychology. Harding wrote many other well-known books, including: ''Psychic Energy'', ''Women's Mysteries'', ''The Parental Image'', and ''The I and not I'', along with numerous papers on a variety of subjects from depression to religion.

Harding helped to found many Jungian organizations, such as the Analytical Psychology Club of New York in 1936, the Medical Society for Analytical Psychology - Eastern Division in 1946, and the C.G. Jung Foundation for Analytical Psychology in 1963. She died in 1971.

==Career==
De Hond studied human geography at the University of Amsterdam, obtaining a degree in 1971. He worked for the university, as assistant with the Sociaal Geografisch Instituut, but became a project leader for Interview-NSS in 1973. He founded Cebeon with [[Hedy d'Ancona]] in 1975, a market research firm targeting the non-profit sector, which he left in 1980 to become a director at Interview-NSS, later a commissioner until 1999. Starting in the mid-80s, De Hond started doing consultancy work for various companies, including [[Vendex]] (for which he led the computer department [[Microcomputer Club Nederland]] (MCN) of the [[Vroom &amp; Dreesmann]] department store and the [[Dixons (Netherlands)|Dixons]] electricals store in the 1980s), ITT and Wegener. In 1998, he was one of the founders of [[Newconomy]], an internet start-up, which after a stock exchange listing in 2000, saw a market cap of €400 million, but sequently lost much of its market value. Eventually, De Hond had to resign from his leadership position. He now polls through his own company, and internet site Peil.nl.

==Deventer murder case==
{{Main|Deventer murder case}}
Since 2005, De Hond campaigned to reopen a murder case that happened in the Dutch city of [[Deventer]]. De Hond believed that a [[tax advisor]] named Ernest Louwes was wrongfully convicted, and that a handyman of the murdered woman, Michaël de Jong, was behind the murder. De Hond led his own investigation into the matter, but a subsequent investigation by the public prosecutors found no reason to reopen the case. De Jong brought De Hond to court over his allegations, which De Hond refused to subside after the matter was closed. A Dutch court found De Hond at fault in continuation of his allegations, after which De Hond was reprimanded and forced to pay De Jong and his girlfriend over €100,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Maurice de Hond moet schadevergoeding betalen aan de klusjesman en diens vriendin | url = http://www.rechtspraak.nl/Actualiteiten/Maurice+de+Hond+moet+schadevergoeding+betalen+aan+de+klusjesman+en+diens+vriendin.htm | publisher = Rechtspraak.nl | date = 2007-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Police Search Maurice de Hond | url = http://www.expatica.com/actual/article.asp?subchannel_id=1&amp;story_id=36530 | publisher = Expatica | date = 2007-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Pollster offers to apologise over murder claim | url = http://www.expatica.com/actual/article.asp?subchannel_id=19&amp;story_id=30777 | publisher = Expatica | date = 2006-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Peace Monger''' ('''Dr. Cobbleskill''') is a [[fictional character]], a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] in the [[Marvel Universe]]. His first appearance was in ''Marvel Comics Presents #27''.

==Fictional character biography==
During a fund-raising dinner, Dr. Cobbleskill was attacked by a group calling themselves the Knights of Saint Virgil. They meant to kill him, yet he stopped his bodyguards from acting. The [[American Eagle (Marvel Comics)|American Eagle]] pulled the rug from under the knights. Cobbleskill wanted to punish the men himself, but American Eagle stopped him and left with the newspaper columnist [[Joanna Cargill]]. Later, at a rally in front of the Washington Monument, Cobbleskill led the crowd's emotions to a fever pitch. Joanna Cargill appeared, revealing Cobbleskill's forgery of the attack by the Knights of Saint Virgil, Cobbleskill attacked her physically. When the American Eagle showed up, Cobbleskill had fully transformed into the Peace Monger. A physical dispute followed, which the Peace Monger lost (the crowd's hatred turned to betrayal and confusion, as the Eagle put it), as well as an intellectual debate on fighting prejudice and oppression. Cobbleskill's powers depleted, the American Eagle carried him to the police.{{issue|date=August 2012}}

Years later, Dr. Cobbleskill incited riots in [[Brooklyn]], employing gang members to stir up trouble against other ethnic groups, so he could feed off the hate they would generate amongst one another. An assault upon Korean shop-owners was broken up by the [[U.S. Agent (comics)|U.S. Agent]], who followed gang-member Luis back to the Peace Monger, and fought him. The Peace Monger attempted to feed off the hate of the U.S. Agent himself in order to power-up, but to his horror, found the U.S. Agent was above something as trivial as hate. His own power vanished, leaving him a small, weak man, who the U.S. Agent easily clocked with a single punch.{{issue|date=August 2012}}

He is suspected of the murder of his fourth wife, who died of [[morphine]] poisoning. His first three wives also predeceased him, raising suspicions that he murdered them as well.&lt;ref name=BMJ&gt;{{cite journal| pmc=1119267 | pmid=11124192 | volume=321 | title=Serial homicide by doctors: Shipman in perspective | year=2000 | journal=BMJ | pages=1594–7 | last1 = Kinnell | first1 = HG | doi=10.1136/bmj.321.7276.1594}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clements committed suicide by an overdose of morphine&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hsj.co.uk/news/trust-me-im-a-doctor/26061.article ''"Trust me, I'm a doctor"'' - Bernadette Friend, ''Health Services Journal'', 3 February, 2000]&lt;/ref&gt; before he was caught by the police and therefore never stood trial.

==Life==
Clements was born in 1880 in [[Belfast]], [[Ireland]]. He graduated in 1904, aged 24.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=pmhjXJ-n_fMC&amp;q=%22Robert+George+Clements%22&amp;dq=%22Robert+George+Clements%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=jeyATNqmNsubOLrjucsO&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwBA ''The collected works of Max Haines, Volume 4''], Max Haines, 2000. Page 571&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marriages==
Clement married four times. His first wife, Edith, died of "sleeping sickness" in 1920 aged 40. His second, Mary, died of [[endocarditis]] in 1925, aged 25, and his third, Kathleen, died of cancer.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=AqohAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22Robert+George+Clements%22&amp;dq=%22Robert+George+Clements%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=pPOATITqIcqlOL2kjIoO&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ved=0CEEQ6AEwBzgU ''The People's almanac presents the book of lists''], David Wallechinsky, Irving Wallace, Amy Wallace, 1977. Page 70&lt;/ref&gt; His last wife, Amy Victoria Burnett, was the daughter of a wealthy industrialist. She died on 27 May 1947 in suspicious circumstances in [[Southport]]. The previous day Clements had called in another doctor when his wife fell ill. She was taken to a nursing home where she died the next day.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=-XvaAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22Robert+George+Clements%22&amp;dq=%22Robert+George+Clements%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=u-6ATL2-KsnaOJyAvdcO&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAjgK ''The new murderers' who's who''], page 86&lt;/ref&gt; Both Clements and the other doctor called in diagnosed myeloid [[leukaemia]], which was confirmed by a botched [[post-mortem]] carried out by another physician, Dr James Houston.

The circumstances of Burnett's death caused people at the time to question the deaths of Clement's first three wives. All, with the exception of the third, were wealthy women when he married them and were almost penniless at the time of their deaths. Clements signed the death certificates himself&lt;ref name=BMJ/&gt; and although there were some suspicions voiced following the death of his third wife there wasn't any opportunity to perform a post-mortem as her body had already been cremated.

When the police came to arrest Clements they found that he had committed suicide, leaving a note:

:"To Whom It May Concern: I can no longer tolerate the diabolical insults to which I have been recently exposed."

A second autopsy was conducted by a Dr Grace who deduced that she had died from [[morphine]] poisoning. This was confirmed by Dr J.B. Firth, Director of the [[Home Office]] Laboratory in [[Preston, Lancashire|Preston]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?ei=pPOATITqIcqlOL2kjIoO&amp;ct=result&amp;id=oPpAAAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=%22Robert+George+Clements%22&amp;q=%22Clements%22#search_anchor ''The medical murderer''], 1967.

'''Romeo Acquarone''' (1895 – 1980) was a professional tennis player born in Monaco &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archives.mairie.mc/ark:/63956/s00572754fb47604/573da956ca1c6|title=Conditions de réutilisation des ressources de ce site - Archives de la ville de Monaco|website=archives.mairie.mc}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  He became a French citizen in 1937 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k65840886|title=Journal officiel de la République française.

Acquarone won the [[French Pro Championship#Bristol_Cup|Bristol Cup]] in France in 1920 (beating Joseph Negro in the final). The Bristol Cup was the top professional tournament in the world in the 1920s.

'''Saint Peter''' ([[Syriac language|Syriac/Aramaic]]: ܫܸܡܥܘܿܢ ܟܹ݁ܐܦ݂ܵܐ, ''Shemayon Keppa''; {{lang-he|שמעון בר יונה}} {{transl|arc|''Shim'on bar Yona''}}; {{lang-grc-gre|Πέτρος|Petros}}; {{lang-cop|ⲡⲉⲧⲣⲟⲥ|Petros}}; {{lang-lat|Petrus}}; r. AD 30;&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt; died between AD 64 and 68),&lt;ref name="newadvent.org"/&gt; also known as '''Simon Peter''', '''Simeon''', or '''Simon''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|aɪ|m|ə|n}}, {{pronunciation|Pope Peter Pronunciation.ogg}}), according to the [[New Testament]], was one of the [[Twelve Apostles]] of [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]], leaders of the [[Early Christianity|early Christian]] [[Great Church]]. [[Pope Gregory I]] called him repeatedly the "[[Prince of the Apostles]]".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf212.iii.v.vii.xxvi.html Letter to Eulogius, Bishop of Alexandria (Register of the Epistles of Saint Gregory the Great, Book VII, Epistle XL)]&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Catholic theology|Catholic teaching]], Jesus promised Peter in the "[[Primacy of Peter|Rock of My Church]]" dialogue in Matthew {{bibleverse-nb|Matthew|16:18}} a special position in the Church. He is traditionally counted as the first Bishop of Rome{{mdashb}}or [[pope]]{{mdashb}}and also by [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern Christian tradition]] as the first [[Patriarch of Antioch]]. The ancient Christian churches all [[veneration|venerate]] Peter as a major [[saint]] and as the founder of the [[Church of Antioch]] and the [[Diocese of Rome|Roman Church]],&lt;ref name="newadvent.org"/&gt; but differ in their attitudes regarding the authority of his present-day successors (the [[primacy of the Bishop of Rome]]).

The New Testament indicates that Peter's father's name was John (or ''Jonah'' or ''Jona'')&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref|Jn|1:42|9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was from the village of [[Bethsaida]] in the province of [[Galilee]] or [[Gaulanitis]]. His brother [[Andrew the Apostle|Andrew]] was also an [[Apostle (Christian)|apostle]]. According to New Testament accounts, Peter was one of twelve apostles chosen by Jesus from his first [[Disciple (Christianity)|disciples]]. Originally a fisherman, he played a leadership role and was with Jesus during events witnessed by only a few apostles, such as the [[Transfiguration of Jesus|Transfiguration]]. According to the [[gospel]]s, Peter [[Confession of Peter|confessed Jesus as the Messiah]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref|Matthew|16:16|9}}&lt;/ref&gt; was part of Jesus's inner circle,&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref|Mark|5:37|9}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Denial of Peter|thrice denied Jesus]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref|Luke|22:54–62|9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and wept bitterly once he realised his deed, and preached on the day of [[Pentecost]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref|Acts|2:14–40|9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Apostolic Age|Christian tradition]], Peter was crucified in [[Rome]] under Emperor [[Nero]]. It is traditionally held that he was crucified upside down at his own request, since he saw himself unworthy to be crucified in the same way as Jesus. Tradition holds that he was crucified at the site of the [[Clementine Chapel]]. His remains are said to be those contained in the underground [[Saint Peter's tomb|Confessio]] of [[St. Peter's Basilica]], where [[Pope Paul VI]] announced in 1968 the excavated discovery of a first-century Roman [[cemetery]]. Every 29 June since 1736, a statue of Saint Peter in St. Peter's Basilica is adorned with [[papal tiara]], [[ring of the fisherman]], and [[Papal regalia and insignia|papal vestments]], as part of the celebration of the [[Feast of Saints Peter and Paul]]. According to [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[doctrine]], the direct [[Apostolic succession|papal successor]] to Saint Peter is the incumbent pope, currently [[Pope Francis]].

Two [[general epistles]] in the New Testament are ascribed to Peter, &lt;!-- Do not alter the preceding clause without consensus. The cited source says the Petrine authorship is generally rejected, not that there is "debate" among scholars. --&gt;but modern scholars generally reject the [[Authorship of the Petrine epistles|Petrine authorship]] of both&lt;!-- Do not alter the preceding clause without consensus.

[http://www.cosmolearning.com/video-lectures/apocalyptic-and-accommodation-6817/ Lecture 24 (transcript)].&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Gospel of Mark]] was traditionally thought to show the influence of Peter's preaching and eyewitness memories. Several other books bearing his name{{mdashb}}the [[Acts of Peter]], [[Gospel of Peter]], [[Clementine literature|Preaching of Peter]], [[Apocalypse of Peter]], and [[Judgment of Peter]]{{mdashb}}are considered by Christian denominations as [[New Testament apocrypha|apocryphal]], and are thus not included in their [[Bible]] canons.&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Fathers of the Church|author=Chapman, Henry Palmer}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Patrick Halton, [https://books.google.com/books?id=uqzY1zBtKg0C&amp;pg=PA5#v=onepage&amp;q=%22I%20simon%20Peter%22%20%22Ones%20who%20are%20scattered%22&amp;f=false ''On Illustrious Men''], v. 100, CUA Press, 1999, pp 5–7 {{ISBN|0-8132-0100-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/2708.htm "The Early Church Fathers"], Chapter 1, New Advent&lt;/ref&gt;

==Names and etymologies==
[[File:The Calling of Saints Peter and Andrew - Caravaggio (1571-1610).jpg|thumb|left|''Calling of Peter and Andrew'', [[Caravaggio]]]]

Peter's original name, as indicated in the New Testament, was "Simon" (Σίμων ''Simōn'' in [[Greek language|Greek]]) or (only in Acts 15:14 and 2 Peter 1:1) "Simeon" (Συμεών in Greek). The Simon/Simeon variation has been explained as reflecting "the well-known custom among Jews at the time of giving the name of a famous patriarch or personage of the Old Testament to a male child along with a similar sounding Greek/Roman name".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=NDg8AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA122&amp;dq=%22similar+sounding+Greek/Roman+name%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwig2YbCu9_XAhUIDsAKHY5_DkIQ6AEINjAD#v=onepage&amp;q=%22similar%20sounding%20Greek%2FRoman%20name%22&amp;f=false Joseph A. Fitzmyer, "Aramaic Kepha' and Peter's Name in the New Testament" in Robert McLachlan Wilson (ed.), ''Text and Interpretation: Studies in the New Testament Presented to Matthew Black'' (Cambridge University Press, 1979), p. 122]&lt;/ref&gt;

He was later given the name כֵּיפָא (''Kepha'') in [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]], which was rendered in Greek (by transliteration and the addition of a final [[sigma]] to make it a masculine word) as Κηφᾶς, whence [[Latin]] and [[English language|English]] ''Cephas'' (9 occurrences in the New Testament);&lt;ref&gt;[http://biblehub.com/greek/2786.htm Strong's Concordance G2786]&lt;/ref&gt; or (by translation with masculine termination) as Πέτρος, whence Latin ''Petrus'' and English ''Peter'' (156 occurrences in the New Testament).&lt;ref&gt;[http://biblehub.com/greek/4074.htm Strong's Concordance G4074]&lt;/ref&gt;

The precise meaning of the Aramaic word is disputed, some saying that its usual meaning is "rock" or "crag", others saying that it means rather "stone" and, particularly in its application by Jesus to Simon, "precious stone" or "jewel", but most scholars agree that as a proper name it denotes a rough or tough character.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Z8DXDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT36&amp;dq=%22american+nickname+rocky%27&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiqtN_iud_XAhWpDMAKHb_rA5AQ6AEIOzAD#v=onepage&amp;q=%22american%20nickname%20rocky'&amp;f=false A. Edward Siecienski, ''The Papacy and the Orthodox: Sources and History of a Debate'' (Oxford University Press, 2017), section "The Call and the Name"]&lt;/ref&gt; Both meanings, "stone" (jewel or hewn stone) and "rock", are indicated in dictionaries of Aramaic&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.archive.org/stream/dictionaryoftarg01jastuoft#page/634/mode/1up Marcus Jastrow ''Dictionary of the Targumim, the Talmud Babli and Yerushalmi, and the Midrashic Literature'' (1903), p. 634.

Accessed 2017-11-27]&lt;/ref&gt; Catholic theologian Rudolf Pesch argues that the Aramaic ''cepha'' means "stone, ball, clump, clew" and that "rock" is only a connotation; that in the Attic Greek ''petra'' denotes "grown rock, rocky range, cliff, grotto"; and that ''petros'' means "small stone, firestone, sling stone, moving boulder".&lt;ref&gt;Pesch, Rudolf (1980). Simon-Petrus. Hiersemann, Stuttgart. p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;

The combined name Σίμων Πέτρος (Simon Peter) appears 19 times in the New Testament. In some [[Syriac language|Syriac]] documents he is called, in English translation, Simon Cephas.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=518BdgLmXN4C&amp;pg=PA673&amp;lpg=PA673&amp;dq=%22teaching+of+simon+cephas%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=rSb0ypl_pD&amp;sig=czKesPacK_7pThNBlBwq9OlhgNg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjDya71od7XAhVIDMAKHTq1CAYQ6AEIPTAF#v=onepage&amp;q=%22teaching%20of%20simon%20cephas%22&amp;f=false The Teaching of Simon Cephas in the City of Rome]''; ''[https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Ante-Nicene_Fathers/Volume_IX/The_Diatessaron_of_Tatian/The_Diatessaron/Section_LIV The Diatessaron]''&lt;/ref&gt;

==New Testament account==
[[File:Ancient capernum is.JPG|thumb|Ruins of ancient [[Capernaum]] on north side of the [[Sea of Galilee]]]]

Peter's life story is told in the four [[canonical gospels]], the [[Acts of the Apostles]], New Testament letters, the non-canonical [[Gospel of the Hebrews]] and other [[Early Church]] accounts of his life and death. In the [[New Testament]], he is among the first&lt;!-- not THE first: in John, Andrew is called first --&gt; of the disciples called during Jesus' ministry. Peter became the first listed apostle ordained by Jesus in the early church.&lt;ref name="ODCC Peter"&gt;"Peter, St. " F. L., Cross, ''The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church'', Oxford University Press, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Peter was a fisherman in [[Bethsaida]].{{Bibleref2c|Jn.|1:44}} He was named Simon, son of Jonah or John.&lt;ref&gt;His father's name is given as 'Jonah',{{Bibleref2c|Jn.|1:42}} {{Bibleref2c|Matt.|16:17}} although some manuscripts of John give his father's name as ''John''.&lt;/ref&gt; The three [[Synoptic Gospels]] recount how Peter's mother-in-law [[Healing the mother of Peter's wife|was healed by Jesus]] at their home in [[Capernaum]]{{Bibleref2c|Matt.|8:14–17}} {{Bibleref2c|Mk.|1:29–31}} {{Bibleref2c|Lk.|4:38}}; this passage clearly depicts Peter as being married. {{Bibleref2|1 Cor.|9:5}} has also been taken to imply that he was married.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=JwZWAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA92&amp;dq=%22Peter%27s+wife%22+Corinthians&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjf7r3Hj5fZAhVBKsAKHebDC40Q6AEIMzAC#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Peter's%20wife%22%20Corinthians&amp;f=false Raymond F.

[[File:Duccio di Buoninsegna 036.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|left|''The Calling of the Apostles Peter and Andrew'' (from the ''Maestà''), c. 1308–1311]]

In the [[Synoptic Gospels]], Peter (then Simon) was a fisherman along with his brother, [[Saint Andrew|Andrew]], and the sons of Zebedee, James and John. The [[Gospel of John]] also depicts Peter fishing, even after the resurrection of Jesus, in the story of the [[Miraculous Draught of Fish|Catch of 153 fish]]. In Matthew and Mark, Jesus called Simon and his brother Andrew to be "[[fishers of men]]".{{Bibleref2c|Matt.|4:18–19}} {{Bibleref2c|Mk.|1:16–17}}

A Franciscan church is built upon the traditional site of Apostle Peter's house.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/MFAArchive/2000_2009/2000/3/Capernaum-%20The%20Church%20of%20the%20House%20of%20Peter|title=2BackToHomePage3|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]], Simon Peter owns the boat that Jesus uses to preach to the multitudes who were pressing on him at the shore of [[Sea of Galilee|Lake Gennesaret]].{{Bibleref2c|Lk.|5:3}} Jesus then amazes Simon and his companions James and John (Andrew is not mentioned) by telling them to lower their nets, whereupon they catch a huge number of fish. Immediately after this, they follow him.{{Bibleref2c|Lk.|5:4–11}} The Gospel of John gives a comparable account of "The First Disciples".{{Bibleref2c|Jn.|1:35–42}} In John, we are told that it was two disciples of [[John the Baptist]] (Andrew and an unnamed disciple) who heard John the Baptist announce Jesus as the "[[Lamb of God]]" and then followed Jesus. Andrew then went to his brother Simon, saying, "We have found the [[Messiah]]", and then brought Simon to Jesus.

[[File:Cavalier d'Arpino - Christ Taken Prisoner - WGA04690.jpg|thumb|right|Apostle Peter striking the [[High Priest]]s' servant [[Malchus]] with a sword in the [[Garden of Gethsemane]]]]

Three of the four gospels – Matthew, Mark and John – recount the story of Jesus [[Jesus walking on water|walking on water]]. Matthew additionally describes Peter walking on water for a moment but beginning to sink when his faith wavers.{{Bibleref2c|Matt.|14:28–31}}

At the beginning of the [[Last Supper]], Jesus washed his disciples' feet. Peter initially refused to let Jesus wash his feet, but when Jesus responded: "If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with me", Peter replied: "Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head".{{Bibleref2c|Jn.|13:2–11}} The [[foot washing|washing of feet]] is often repeated in the [[service of worship]] on [[Maundy Thursday]] by some [[Christian denominations]].

The three [[Synoptic Gospels]] all mention that, when Jesus was arrested, one of his companions cut off the ear of a servant of the High Priest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref2|Matt.|26:51}}, {{Bibleref2|Mk.|14:47}}, {{Bibleref2|Lk.|22:50}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Gospel of John also includes this event and names Peter as the swordsman and [[Malchus]] as the victim.{{Bibleref2c|Jn.|18:10}} Luke adds that Jesus touched the ear and miraculously healed it.{{Bibleref2c|Lk.|22:49–51}} This healing of the servant's ear is the last of the [[Miracles of Jesus|37 miracles attributed to Jesus]] in the Bible.

==={{anchor|Rock}}"Rock" dialogue===&lt;!-- [[Rock of the faith]] redirects here --&gt;

In a dialogue between Jesus and his disciples ({{bibleverse||Matthew|16:13–19|NIV}}), Jesus asks, "Who do people say that the [[Son of Man]] is?" The disciples give various answers. When he asks, "Who do ''you'' say that I am?" Simon Peter answers, "You are the Messiah, the Son of the living God." Jesus then declares:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Blessed are you, Simon son of Jonah, for this was not revealed to you by flesh and blood, but by my Father in heaven. And I tell you that you are Cephas (Peter) (''Petros''), and on this rock (''petra'') I will build my church, and the gates of Hades will not overcome it. I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven; whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A common view of Peter is provided by Jesuit Father [[Daniel J. Harrington]], who suggests that Peter was an unlikely symbol of stability. While he was one of the first disciples called and was the spokesman for the group, Peter is also the exemplar of "little faith". In {{Bibleref2|Matthew|14}}, Peter will soon have Jesus say to him, "O you of little faith, why did you doubt?", and he will eventually deny Jesus three times. Thus, in light of the Easter event, Peter became an exemplar of the forgiven sinner.&lt;ref&gt;[[Daniel J. Harrington|Harrington, Daniel J.]] "Peter the Rock." ''America,'' August 18–25, 2008. Accessed Oct. 9, 2009: p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; Outside the Catholic Church, opinions vary as to the interpretation of this passage with respect to what authority and responsibility, if any, Jesus was giving to Peter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What did Jesus mean when he said, "Upon this rock I will build my church"?|url=https://bible.org/question/what-did-jesus-mean-when-he-said-%E2%80%9Cupon-rock-i-will-build-my-church%E2%80%9D|website=Bible.org|accessdate=10 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] this passage is interpreted as not implying a special prominence to the person of Peter, but to Peter's position as representative of the Apostles. The word used for "rock" (''petra'') grammatically refers to "a small detachment of the massive ledge",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Rienecker | first = Fritz | authorlink = Frotz Rienecker | last2 = Rogers | first2 = Cleon | author2-link = Cleon Rogers | title = Linguistic key to the Greek New Testament | place = Grand Rapids MI | publisher = Regency Reference Library ([[Zondervan Publishing House]]) | year = 1976 | volume = | edition = | page = 49 | pages = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-310-32050-X | postscript = &lt;!-- None --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; not to a massive boulder. Thus, Orthodox [[Sacred Tradition]] understands Jesus' words as referring to the apostolic faith.

''Petros'' had not previously been used as a name, but in the Greek-speaking world it became a popular Christian name, after the tradition of Peter's prominence in the early Christian church had been established.

===Denial of Jesus by Peter===
[[File:El Greco - Las lágrimas de San Pedro.jpg|thumb|''The tears of Saint Peter'', by [[El Greco]]]]
{{Main|Denial of Peter}}
[[File:The Denial of Saint Peter-Caravaggio (1610).jpg|thumb|''The Denial of Saint Peter'', by [[Caravaggio]]]]
All four canonical gospels recount that, during the [[Last Supper]], Jesus foretold that Peter would deny him three times before the following cockcrow ("before the cock crows twice" in Mark's account).

The three Synoptics and John describe the three denials as follows:

# A denial when a female servant of the high priest spots Simon Peter, saying that he had been with Jesus. According to Mark (but not in all manuscripts), "the rooster crowed". Only Luke and John mention a fire by which Peter was warming himself among other people: according to Luke, Peter was "sitting"; according to John, he was "standing".
# A denial when Simon Peter had gone out to the gateway, away from the firelight, but the same servant girl (Mark) or another servant girl (Matthew) or a man (Luke and also John, for whom, though, this is the third denial) told the bystanders he was a follower of Jesus. According to John, "the rooster crowed".
# A denial came when Peter's Galilean accent was taken as proof that he was indeed a disciple of Jesus. According to Matthew, Mark and Luke, "the rooster crowed". Matthew adds that it was his [[Accent (sociolinguistics)|accent]] that gave him away as coming from Galilee. Luke deviates slightly from this by stating that, rather than a crowd accusing Simon Peter, it was a third individual. John does not mention the Galilean accent.

The Gospel of John places the second denial while Peter was still warming himself at the fire, and gives as the occasion of the third denial a claim by someone to have seen him in the garden of [[Gethsemane]] when [[arrest of Jesus|Jesus was arrested]].

In the Gospel of Luke is a record of Christ telling Peter: "Simon, Simon, behold, Satan hath desired to have you, that he may sift you as wheat: but I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not: and when thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren."

In a reminiscent&lt;ref name="May Metzger"&gt;May, Herbert G. and Bruce M. Metzger. The New Oxford Annotated Bible with the Apocrypha. 1977.&lt;/ref&gt; scene in John's epilogue, Peter affirms three times that he loves Jesus.

===Resurrection appearances===
[[File:Church peters primacy.jpg|thumb|left|Church of the Primacy of St. Peter on the [[Sea of Galilee]]]]
In John's gospel, Peter is the first person to enter the [[empty tomb]], although the women and the [[beloved disciple]] see it before him.{{Bibleref2c|Jn.|20:1–9}} In Luke's account, the women's report of the empty tomb is dismissed by the apostles, and Peter is the only one who goes to check for himself, running to the tomb. After seeing the graveclothes he goes home, apparently without informing the other disciples.{{Bibleref2c|Lk.|24:1–12}}

Paul's [[First Epistle to the Corinthians]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref2|1Cor|15}}&lt;/ref&gt; contains a list of [[resurrection appearances of Jesus]], the first of which is an appearance to Peter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref2|1Cor|15:3–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here, Paul apparently follows an early tradition that Peter was the first to see the risen Christ,&lt;ref name="ODCC Peter" /&gt; which, however, did not seem to have survived to the time when the gospels were written.&lt;ref&gt;See {{Bibleref2|Matthew|28:8–10}}, {{Bibleref2|John|20:16}} and {{Bibleref2|Luke|24:13–16}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[John 21|final chapter]] of the Gospel of John, Peter, in one of the resurrection appearances of Jesus, [[Restoration of Peter|three times affirmed his love for Jesus]], balancing his threefold denial, and Jesus reconfirmed Peter's position. The Church of the Primacy of St. Peter on the [[Sea of Galilee]] is seen as the traditional site where Jesus Christ appeared to his disciples after his resurrection and, according to Catholic tradition, established Peter's supreme jurisdiction over the Christian church.

===Position among the apostles===
[[File:JanStyka-SaintPeter.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|''St. Peter Preaching the Gospel in the Catacombs'' by [[Jan Styka]]]]

Peter is always listed first among the Twelve Apostles in the gospels&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref2|Matt.|10:2–4}}, {{Bibleref2|Mk.|3:16–19}}, {{Bibleref2|Lk.|6:14–16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the Book of Acts (Acts 1:13). He is also frequently mentioned in the gospels as forming with [[James, son of Zebedee|James the Elder]] and [[John the Apostle|John]] a special group within the Twelve Apostles, present at incidents at which the others were not present, such as at the [[Transfiguration of Jesus]],&lt;ref&gt;Matthew 17:1; Mark 9:2; Luke 9:28&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[raising of Jairus' daughter]]&lt;ref&gt;Mark 5:37; Luke 8:51&lt;/ref&gt; and at [[Agony in the Garden|the agony]] in the Garden of Gethsemane.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew 26:37; Mark 14:33&lt;/ref&gt; Peter often confesses his faith in Jesus as the Messiah.

Peter is often depicted in the gospels as spokesman of all the Apostles.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew 15:15; 19:27; Luke 12:41; John 6:67–68&lt;/ref&gt; Catholics refer to him as chief of the Apostles,&lt;ref name=CE&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf212.ii.v.xlii.html |title=Sermon by Leo the Great (440–461) |publisher=Ccel.org |date=2005-07-13 |accessdate=2010-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; as do the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greekorthodox.org.au/downloads/files/english/voo/2005/11VOO05E |title=Archbishop Stylianos of Australia |date= |accessdate=2010-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Oriental Orthodoxy|Oriental Orthodox]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.syrianchurch.org/PZakka/Jubilee.htm |title=Patriarch H.H.Ignatius Zakka I Iwas |publisher=Syrianchurch.org |date= |accessdate=2010-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://syrianorthodoxchurch.com/pa_identity.htm|title=Syriac Orthodox Church in Canada – Identity of the Church|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Coptic Orthodox Church liturgy, he is once referred to as "prominent" or "head" among the Apostles, a title shared with Paul in the text (''The Fraction of Fast and Feast of the Apostles Peter and Paul in the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria''). Some, including the Orthodox Churches, believe this is not the same as saying that the other Apostles were under Peter's orders. In contrast, [[Jewish Christians]] are said to have argued that [[James the Just]] was the leader of the group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cbi.sagepub.com/content/5/1/73.abstract |title=James the Just in History and Tradition: Perspectives of Past and Present Scholarship (Part I) |last=Myllykoski |first=Matti |publisher=Helsinki Collegium for Advanced Studies, Finland |accessdate=2014-04-02 |quote=James the Just, the brother of Jesus, is known from the New Testament as the chief apostle of the Torah-obedient Christians.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some argue [[James the Just]] was [[Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem|bishop of Jerusalem]] whilst Peter was [[bishop of Rome]] and that this position at times gave James privilege in some (but not all) situations. The early Church historian Eusebius (c. AD 325) records [[Clement of Alexandria]] (c. AD 190) as saying, &lt;blockquote&gt;

"For they say that Peter and [[James, son of Zebedee|James]] (the Greater) and [[John the Apostle|John]] after the ascension of our Saviour, as if also preferred by our Lord, strove not after honor, but chose [[James the Just]] bishop of Jerusalem."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/250102.htm |title=Church History Book II, Chapter I, quoting Clement of Alexandria's Sixth book of Hypotyposes |publisher=Newadvent.org |date= |accessdate=2010-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Peter was considered along with James the Just and John the Apostle as pillars of the Church'' (Galatians 2:9)''. Paul affirms that Peter had the special charge of being apostle to the Jews, just as he, Paul, was apostle to the Gentiles.

===Role in the early church===
[[File:Liberation of Saint Peter by Giovanni Lanfranco-BMA.jpg|thumb|left|''The Liberation of St. Peter'' from prison by an angel, by [[Giovanni Lanfranco]]]]

The author of the [[Acts of the Apostles]] portrays Peter as an extremely important figure within the early Christian community, with Peter delivering a significant [[Open-air preaching|open-air sermon]] during [[Pentecost]]. According to the same book, Peter took the lead in selecting a replacement for [[Judas Iscariot]].{{Bibleref2c|Acts|1:15}} Following this appointment, we see Peter establish the conditions for being an apostle as those who have spent time with Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+1&amp;version=NRSV|title=Bible Gateway passage: Acts 1 - New Revised Standard Version|website=Bible Gateway|access-date=2017-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Peter's authority lent to his role as an adjudicator in conflicts and moral matters.  He takes on this role in the case of Ananias and Sapphira and holds them accountable for lying about their alms-giving.  Peter passes judgement upon them and they are individually struck dead over the infraction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+5&amp;version=NRSV|title=Bible Gateway passage: Acts 5 - New Revised Standard Version|website=Bible Gateway|access-date=2017-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Peter's role wasn't always based around his leadership, but around his gifts for taking care of those in need.  We see Peter establish these trends by reaching out to the sick and lame. Peter heals 2 individuals who cannot walk or are paralyzed&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+3&amp;version=NRSV|title=Bible Gateway passage: Acts 3 - New Revised Standard Version|website=Bible Gateway|access-date=2017-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+9&amp;version=NRSV|title=Bible Gateway passage: Acts 9 - New Revised Standard Version|website=Bible Gateway|access-date=2017-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as raising Tabitha from the dead.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  While these acts were miracles of compassion, they also contributed to the number of believers in the early church

He was twice arraigned, with John, before the [[Sanhedrin]] and directly defied them.{{Bibleref2c|Acts|4:7–22}} {{Bibleref2c-nb|Acts|5:18–42}} After receiving a vision from God that allowed for the eating of previously unclean animals, Peter takes a missionary journey to [[Lod|Lydda]], [[Jaffa, Israel|Joppa]] and [[Caesarea Maritima|Caesarea]],{{Bibleref2c-nb|Acts|9:32–10:2}} becoming instrumental in the decision to evangelise the [[Gentile]]s.{{Bibleref2c-nb|Acts|10}} He applied the message of the vision on clean animals to the gentiles and follows his meeting with Cornelius by claiming that 'God shows no partiality.'&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+10&amp;version=NRSV|title=Bible Gateway passage: Acts 10 - New Revised Standard Version|website=Bible Gateway|access-date=2017-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the 13th chapter of the [[Acts of the Apostles]], the narrative turns its attention away from Peter and to the activities of Paul, and the Bible is mostly silent on what occurred to Peter afterwards.

[[John Vidmar]], a Catholic scholar, writes: "Catholic scholars agree that Peter had an authority that superseded that of the other apostles. Peter is their spokesman at several events, he conducts the election of Matthias, his opinion in the debate over converting Gentiles was crucial, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zENJHwQqSy0C#v=onepage&amp;q=Both%20Catholic%20and%20Protestant%20scholars%20agree&amp;f=false |title=John Vidmar, The Catholic Church through the ages: a history. pp. 39–40 |publisher=Books.google.com |date= July 2005|accessdate=2010-09-12|isbn=978-0-8091-4234-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Acts of the Apostles]], Peter and John were sent from Jerusalem to [[Samaria]] ({{bibleverse|Acts||8:14}}). 
Peter/Cephas is mentioned briefly in the opening chapter of Paul's [[Epistle to the Galatians]], which mentions a trip by Paul to [[Jerusalem]] where he meets Peter ({{bibleverse|Galatians||1:18}}).   Peter features again in Galatians, fourteen years later, when Paul (now with Barnabas and Titus) returned to Jerusalem ({{bibleverse|Galatians||2:7–9}}), and then, when Peter came to Antioch, Paul opposed Peter to his face "because he [Peter] was in the wrong" ([[New International Version|NIV]]) ({{bibleverse|Galatians||2:11}}).&lt;ref&gt;see [[Incident at Antioch]]; see also the section below headed "Road to Rome: Antioch and Corinth"&lt;/ref&gt;

{{bibleverse||Acts|12|niv}} tells how Peter, who was in Jerusalem, was put into prison by [[Agrippa I|King Herod]] (A.D. 42–44), but was [[liberation of Saint Peter|rescued by an angel]]. After his liberation Peter left Jerusalem to go to "another place" (Acts 12:1–18). Concerning Peter's subsequent activity we receive no further connected information from the extant sources, although we possess short notices of certain individual episodes of his later life.&lt;ref name="newadvent.org"/&gt;

At the [[Council of Jerusalem]] (c. 50), the early Church, Paul and the leaders of the Jerusalem church met and decided to embrace Gentile converts. Acts portrays Peter and other leaders as successfully opposing the Christian Pharisees who insisted on [[circumcision]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Harris |first=Stephen L. |author-link=Stephen L Harris |title=Understanding the Bible |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U-yAQQAACAAJ |edition=8th |location=New York |publisher=McGraw-Hill |year=2010 |page=420 |isbn=978-0-07-340744-9}} "Christian Pharisees demand that the entire Torah be kept, but Peter reportedly opposes this ([Acts] 15:10) and,&amp;nbsp;... silences the Judaizers."&lt;/ref&gt;

The church in Rome was already flourishing when Paul wrote his [[Epistle to the Romans]] about AD 57,&lt;ref name="Franzen, p.26"&gt;Franzen, p.26&lt;/ref&gt; he greets some fifty people in Rome by name,&lt;ref name="bibleverse-nb||Romans|16"&gt;{{bibleverse-nb||Romans|16}}&lt;/ref&gt; but not Peter [[Incident at Antioch|whom he knew]]. There is also no mention of Peter in Rome later during Paul's two-year stay there in {{bibleverse|Acts||28}}, about AD 60–62. Some Church historians consider Peter and Paul to have been [[martyr]]ed under the reign of Nero,&lt;ref name="ODCC self"&gt;"Paul, St" Cross, F. L., ed. The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church. New York: Oxford University Press. 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pennington, p. 2"&gt;Pennington, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="St-Paul-Outside-the-Walls homepage"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/various/basiliche/san_paolo/en/basilica/tomba.htm |title=Papal Basilica – Saint Paul Outside-the-Walls |publisher= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090720031958/http://www.vatican.va/various/basiliche/san_paolo/en/basilica/tomba.htm |archivedate=20 July 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; around AD 65.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Historians debate whether the Roman government distinguished between Christians and Jews prior to Nerva's modification of the [[Fiscus Judaicus]] in 96.

==Connection to Rome==
[[File:Correggio - The Apostles Peter and Paul, detail of cupola fresco - WGA05317.jpg|thumb|The Apostles Peter and Paul, detail of cupola fresco by [[Correggio]] ]]
In a strong tradition of the [[Early Church]], Peter is said to have founded the Church in Rome with Paul, served as its bishop, authored two epistles, and then met martyrdom there along with Paul. Christians of different theological backgrounds are in disagreement as to the exact significance of Peter's ministry. For instance: 
* Catholics view Peter as the first pope. The Catholic Church asserts that Peter's ministry, conferred upon him by Jesus of Nazareth in the gospels, lays down the theological foundation for the pope's exercise of pastoral authority over the Church.
* Eastern Orthodox also believe that Peter's ministry points to an underlying theology wherein a special primacy ought to be granted to Peter's successors above other Church leaders but see this as merely a "primacy of honor", rather than the right to exercise pastoral authority.
* Protestant denominations assert that Peter's apostolic work in Rome does not imply a connection between him and the papacy.
Similarly, historians of various backgrounds also offer differing interpretations of the Apostle's presence in Rome.

===Road to Rome: Antioch and Corinth===
According to the Epistle to the Galatians ({{bibleverse-nb|Galatians|2:11}}), Peter went to Antioch where Paul rebuked him for separating himself from Gentiles (see the [[Incident at Antioch]]). Galatians is accepted as authentic by almost all scholars. These may be the earliest mentions of Peter to be written. Later accounts expand on the brief biblical mention of his visit to [[Antioch]]. The ''[[Liber Pontificalis]]'' (9th century) mentions Peter as having served as bishop of Antioch for seven years and having potentially left his family in the Greek city before his journey to Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Louise Ropes Loomis, The Book of Popes (Liber Pontificalis). Merchantville, NJ: Evolution Publishing. {{ISBN|1-889758-86-8}} (Reprint of the 1916 edition).&lt;/ref&gt; Claims of direct blood lineage from Simon Peter among the old population of Antioch existed in the 1st century and continue to exist today, notably by certain [[Semaan]] families of modern-day Syria and Lebanon. Historians have furnished other evidence of Peter's sojourn in Antioch.&lt;ref&gt;This is provided in Downey, ''A History of Antioch'', pp. 583–586. This evidence is accepted by M. Lapidge, among others, see Bischoff and Lapidge, ''Biblical Commentaries from the Canterbury School'' (Cambridge, 1994) p. 16. Lastly, see Finegan, ''The Archaeology of the New Testament'', pp. 63–71.&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent tradition held that Peter had been the first [[Patriarch of Antioch]]. According to the writings of Origen&lt;ref&gt;Origen's homilies on Luke VI, 4. [[Patrologia Graeca]] 13:1814&lt;/ref&gt; and Eusebius in his ''Church History (III, 36)'' Peter would have been the founder of the Church of Antioch&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Eusebius|title=Church History Book III, Chapter 36|url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/250103.htm|accessdate=1 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "after having first founded the church at Antioch, went away to Rome preaching the Gospel, and he also, after [presiding over] the church in Antioch, presided over that of Rome until his death".&lt;ref&gt;Eusebius, in his Chronicle (A.D. 303) ''[Chronicle, 44 A.D. [[Patrologia Graeca]] 19:539]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

After presiding over the church in Antioch by a while, Peter would have been succeeded by [[Evodius]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Eusebius|title=Church History Book III Chapter 36:2|url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/250103.htm|publisher=newadvent.org|accessdate=5 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and after by [[Ignatius of Antioch|Ignatius]], who was a student of [[John the Apostle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Eusebius|title=Church History Book III Chapter 22|url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/250103.htm|publisher=newadvent.org|accessdate=5 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eusebius of Caesarea, in his "[[Church History (Eusebius)|Historia Ecclesiastica]] (I,12:2)" while naming some of the Seventy Disciples of Jesus, says:
{{quote|This is the account of Clement, in the fifth book of ''Hypotyposes (A.D. 190)''; in which he also says that Cephas was one of the seventy disciples, a man who bore the same name as the apostle Peter, and the one concerning whom Paul says, [When Cephas came to Antioch I withstood him to his face.]|Galatians 2:11&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Eusebius|title=Church History Book I, Chapter 12:2|url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/250101.htm|accessdate=1 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(ἡ δ᾿ ἱστορία παρὰ Κλήμεντι κατὰ τὴν πέμπτην τῶν Ὑποτυπώσεων· ἐν ᾗ καὶ Κηφᾶν, περὶ οὗ φησιν ὁ Παῦλος· «ὅτε δὲ ἦλθεν Κηφᾶς εἰς Ἀντιόχειαν, κατὰ πρόσωπον αὐτῷ ἀντέστην», ἕνα φησὶ γεγονέναι τῶν ἑβδομήκοντα μαθητῶν, ὁμώνυμον Πέτρῳ τυγχάνοντα τῷ ἀποστόλῳ.)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The ''[[Clementine literature]]'', a group of related works written in the fourth century but believed to contain materials from earlier centuries, relate information about Peter that may come from earlier traditions. One is that Peter had a group of 12 to 16 followers, whom the Clementine writings name.&lt;ref&gt;''Homilies'', 2.1; ''Recognitions'', 2.1&lt;/ref&gt; Another is that it provides an itinerary of Peter's route from [[Caesarea Maritima]] to Antioch, where he debated his adversary [[Simon Magus]]; during this journey he ordained [[Zacchaeus]] as the first bishop of Caesarea and Maro as the first bishop of [[Tripoli, Lebanon|Tripolis]]. Fred Lapham suggests the route recorded in the Clementine writings may have been taken from an earlier document mentioned by [[Epiphanius of Salamis]] in his ''[[Panarion]]'' called "The Itinerary of Peter".&lt;ref&gt;Lapham, ''An Introduction to the New Testament Apocrypha'' (London: T&amp;T Clark International, 2003), p. 76&lt;/ref&gt;

Eusebius of Caesarea relates that when Peter confronts Simon Magus at Judea (mentioned in Acts 8), Simon flees to Rome where the Romans got to regard him as a god. According to Eusebius, his luck did not last long since God sent Peter to Rome and Simon was quenched and immediately destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Eusebius|title=Church History Book II, Chapter 14–15|url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/250102.htm|accessdate=1 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An apocryphal work, the ''[[Actus Vercellenses]]'' (7th century), a Latin text preserved in only one manuscript copy published widely in translation under the title Acts of Peter, sets Peter's confrontation with Simon Magus in Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Lapham, ''Introduction'', p. 72&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/actspeter.html|title=The Acts of Peter|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Peter might have visited [[Corinth, Greece|Corinth]] and maybe would have existed a party of "Cephas".&lt;ref name="ODCC Peter" /&gt;
[[First Corinthians]] suggests that perhaps Peter visited the city of Corinth, located at Greece, during their missions.{{Bibleref2c|1Cor.|1:12}}

[[Dionysius, bishop of Corinth]], in his Epistle to the Roman Church under [[Pope Soter]] (A.D. 165–174) declares that Peter and Paul founded the Church of Rome and the Church of Corinth, and they have lived in Corinth for some time and finally in Italy where they found death:

&lt;blockquote&gt;You have thus by such an admonition bound together the planting of Peter and of Paul at Rome and Corinth. For both of them planted and likewise taught us in our Corinth. And they taught together in like manner in Italy, and suffered martyrdom at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=of Corinth|first1=Dionysius|title=Fragments from a Letter to the Roman Church Chapter III|url=http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/dionysius.html|publisher=www.earlychristianwritings.com|accessdate=1 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Rome===
[[Irenaeus|Irenaeus of Lyons]] wrote in the [[Christianity in the 2nd century|2nd century]] that Peter and Paul had been the founders of the Church in Rome and had appointed [[Pope Linus|Linus]] as succeeding bishop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf01.ix.iv.iv.html|title=ANF01. The Apostolic Fathers with Justin Martyr and Irenaeus|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clement of Alexandria states that "Peter had preached the Word publicly at Rome. ''(A.D. 190)''"&lt;ref name="CL"&gt;{{cite web|author=Eusebius of Caesarea|title=Church History Book VI, Chapter 14:6|url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/250106.htm|accessdate=1 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Jerome]] "Peter went to Rome in the second year of Claudius to overthrow Simon Magus, and held the sacerdotal chair there for twenty-five years until the last, that is the fourteenth, year of Nero."&lt;ref name="Jerome1" /&gt;

[[Lactantius]], in his book called ''Of the Manner in Which the Persecutors Died'', written around 318, noted that "And while Nero reigned, the Apostle Peter came to Rome, and, through the power of God committed unto him, wrought certain miracles, and, by turning many to the true religion, built up a faithful and stedfast temple unto the Lord."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lucius Caecilius Firmianus|first1=Lactantius|title=Of the Manner in Which the Persecutors Died Chapter 2|url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf07.iii.v.ii.html|publisher=ccel.org|accessdate=1 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Catholic Church speaks of the pope, the bishop of Rome, as the successor of Saint Peter. This is often interpreted to imply that Peter was the first Bishop of Rome. However, it is also said that the institution of the papacy is not dependent on the idea that Peter was Bishop of Rome or even on his ever having been in Rome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholic.com/tracts/was-peter-in-rome|title=Was Peter in Rome?|publisher=Catholic Answers|date=August 10, 2004|quote=if Peter never made it to the capital, he still could have been the first pope, since one of his successors could have been the first holder of that office to settle in Rome.

Zwierlein has questioned the authenticity of this document and its traditional dating to c. 105–10, who says it may date from the final decades of the 2nd century instead of from the beginning.&lt;ref name="Zwierlein review"/&gt;

(2:1–11:57); the Book of Glory&amp;nbsp;... (12:1–20:31); and an epilogue (21:1–25)."&lt;/ref&gt; of the Gospel of John, Jesus hints at the death by which Peter would glorify God, saying "when you are old you will stretch out your hands, and another will dress you and carry you where you do not want to go."{{bibleref2c|Jn.|21:18–19}} This is interpreted by some as a reference to Peter's crucifixion.&lt;ref name="May Metzger" /&gt; Theologians Donald Fay Robinson and Warren M. Smaltz have suggested that the incident in {{bibleverse||Acts|12:1–17|NKJV}}, where Peter is "released by an angel" and goes to "another place", really represents an idealized account of his death, which may have occurred in a Jerusalem prison in as early as 44 AD.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, D.

The [[Muratorian fragment]], dated to the second century A.D., notes that the primary eyewitness to Acts, [[Luke the Evangelist|Luke]], was not present at Peter's death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Ante-Nicene_Fathers/Volume_V/Caius/Fragments_of_Caius/Canon_Muratorianus|title=Ante-Nicene Fathers Vol. V, Fragments of Caius|first=|last=Caius|publisher=|via=Wikisource}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, early Church Tradition (as indicated below) says that Peter probably died by [[crucifixion]] (with arms outstretched) at the time of the [[Great Fire of Rome]] in the year 64. The writings of the 1st century Church Father [[Ignatius of Antioch]] refer to Peter and Paul giving admonitions to the Romans, indicating Peter's presence in Rome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ignatius of Antioch|title=The Epistle of Ignatius to the Romans|url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0107.htm|website=newadvent.org|accessdate=15 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Margherita Guarducci]], who led the research leading to the rediscovery of Peter's reputed tomb in its last stages (1963–1968), concludes Peter died on 13 October AD 64 during the festivities on the occasion of the "dies imperii" of Emperor Nero.&lt;ref&gt;Rainer Riesner, ''Paul's Early Period: Chronology, Mission Strategy, Theology'' (Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 1998) p65&lt;/ref&gt; This took place three months after the disastrous fire that destroyed Rome for which the emperor (Nero) wished to blame the Christians. This "dies imperii" (regnal day anniversary) was an important one, exactly ten years after Nero ascended to the throne, and it was 'as usual' accompanied by much bloodshed. Traditionally, [[Roman Empire|Roman]] authorities sentenced him to death by [[crucifixion]]. In accordance with the [[apocryphal]] [[Acts of Peter]], he was crucified head down.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/actspeter.html Apocryphal ''Acts of Peter Chapter 37''].&lt;/ref&gt; Tradition also locates his burial place where the [[St. Peter's Basilica|Basilica of Saint Peter]] was later built, directly beneath the Basilica's high altar.

According to the 1911 ''Catholic Encyclopedia'', Peter labored in Rome during the last portion of his life, and there his life was ended by martyrdom.&lt;ref name="ce-peter"&gt;{{cathEncy|wstitle=St. Peter|volume=11|author=Kirsch, Johann Peter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pope Clement I]], in his ''Letter to the Corinthians'' (Chapter 5), written c. 80–98, speaks of Peter's martyrdom in the following terms: "Let us take the noble examples of our own generation. Through jealousy and envy the greatest and most just pillars of the Church were persecuted, and came even unto death. … Peter, through unjust envy, endured not one or two but many labours, and at last, having delivered his testimony, departed unto the place of glory due to him."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=of Rome|first1=Clement|title=The First Epistle of Clement to the Corinthians|url=http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/1clement-hoole.html|publisher=earlychristianwritings.com|accessdate=1 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The death of Peter is attested to by [[Tertullian]] at the end of the 2nd century, in his ''Prescription Against Heretics'', noting that Peter endured a passion like his Lord's:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Quintus Septimius Florens|first1=Tertullian|title=Prescription Against Heretics Chapter XXXVI|url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf03.v.iii.xxxvi.html|publisher=ccel.org|accessdate=1 June 2015}} "Since, moreover, you are close upon Italy, you have Rome, from which there comes even into our own hands the very authority (of apostles themselves). How happy is its church, on which apostles poured forth all their doctrine along with their blood; where Peter endures a passion like his Lord's; where Paul wins his crown in a death like John's[the Baptist]; where the Apostle John was first plunged, unhurt, into boiling oil, and thence remitted to his island-exile."&lt;/ref&gt; In his work ''Scorpiace 15'', he also speaks of Peter's crucifixion: "The budding faith Nero first made bloody in Rome. There Peter was girded by another, since he was bound to the cross".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Quintus Septimius Florens|first1=Tertullian|title=Scorpiace Chapter 15|url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0318.htm|publisher=newadvent.org|accessdate=6 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Origen]] in his ''Commentary on the Book of Genesis III'', quoted by Eusebius of Caesaria in his ''Ecclesiastical History (III, 1)'', said: "Peter was crucified at Rome with his head downwards, as he himself had desired to suffer."&lt;ref name=CE/&gt; The [[Cross of St. Peter]] inverts the [[Crux immissa|Latin cross]] based on this refusal, and his claim of being unworthy to die the same way as his Saviour.&lt;ref&gt;Granger Ryan &amp; Helmut Ripperger, ''The Golden Legend Of Jacobus De Voragine Part One'', 1941.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pope Peter I of Alexandria|Peter of Alexandria]], who was bishop of [[Alexandria]] and died around A.D. 311, wrote an epistle ''on Penance'', in which he says: "Peter, the first of the apostles, having been often apprehended, and thrown into prison, and treated with ignominy, was last of all crucified at Rome".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=of Alexandria|first1=Peter|title=Canonical Epistle on Penitence Canon 9|url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0620.htm|publisher=newadvent.org|accessdate=3 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jerome describes that "At his Nero's hands Peter received the crown of martyrdom being nailed to the cross with his head towards the ground and his feet raised on high, asserting that he was unworthy to be crucified in the same manner as his Lord."&lt;ref name="Jerome1" /&gt;

The [[apocrypha]]l [[Acts of Peter]] ([[Vercelli manuscript|Vercelli]] Acts XXXV&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/actspeter.html The Acts of Peter], by M. R. James&lt;/ref&gt;), is the source for the tradition about the Latin famous phrase "[[Quo vadis?|Quo vadis, Domine?]]" (in Greek: {{Lang|grc|Κύριε, ποῦ ὑπάγεις "Kyrie, pou hypageis?"}}), which means "Where are you going, Lord?". According to the story, Peter, fleeing Rome to avoid execution meets the risen Jesus. In the Latin translation, Peter asks Jesus, "Quo vadis?" He replies, "Romam eo iterum crucifigi ("I am going to Rome to be crucified again"). Peter then gains the courage to continue his ministry and returns to the city, where he is martyred. This story is commemorated in an [[Annibale Carracci]] painting. The [[Quo Vadis (church)|Church of Quo Vadis]], near the [[Catacombs]] of [[Pope Callistus I|Saint Callistus]], contains a stone in which Jesus' footprints from this event are supposedly preserved, though this was apparently an ''[[ex-voto]]'' from a [[pilgrim]], and indeed a copy of the original, housed in the [[San Sebastiano fuori le mura|Basilica of St Sebastian]].

The ancient historian [[Josephus]] describes how Roman soldiers would amuse themselves by crucifying criminals in different positions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Flavius|first1=Josephus|title=Jewish War, Book V Chapter 11|url=http://www.ccel.org/j/josephus/works/war-5.htm|publisher=ccel.org|accessdate=1 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it is likely that this would have been known to the author of the ''Acts of Peter''. The position attributed to Peter's crucifixion is thus plausible, either as having happened historically or as being an invention by the author of the ''Acts of Peter''. Death, after crucifixion head down, is unlikely to be caused by [[suffocation]], the usual "cause of death in ordinary crucifixion".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=V8IjAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA350 The Holy Bible, according to the authorized version (A.D. 1611)]&amp;nbsp;– [[Frederic Charles Cook]]&amp;nbsp;– J.

===Burial and relics===
[[File:SaintPeterRelic.jpg|thumb|Looking down into the ''[[crypt|confessio]]'' near the tomb of Apostle Peter, [[St. Peter's Basilica]], [[Rome]]]]
Catholic tradition holds that Peter's inverted crucifixion occurred at the spot now occupied by the [[Clementine Chapel]] in the grottoes of Saint Peter's Basilica, with the burial in [[Saint Peter's tomb]] nearby.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video| people = Vatican Cardinal Angelo Comastri (interviewee)| year = 2011| title = Secret Access: The Vatican | medium = Video| language = English, Italian| trans_title = | publisher = A&amp;E Studio Entertainment| location = Vatican City, Rome, Italy| time = 94 minutes| quote = This is the holiest site in the Basilica, where the Apostle Peter was crucified and his blood shed to the ground}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Caius (presbyter)|Caius]] in his ''Disputation Against Proclus (A.D. 198)'', preserved in part by Eusebius, relates this of the places in which the remains of the apostles Peter and Paul were deposited: "I can point out the trophies of the apostles.

According to [[Jerome]], in his work ''[[De Viris Illustribus (Jerome)|De Viris Illustribus]] (A.D. 392)'', "Peter was buried at Rome in the Vatican near the triumphal way where he is venerated by the whole world."&lt;ref name="Jerome1"&gt;{{cite web|last1=saint|first1=Jerome|title=De Viris Illustribus (On Illustrious Men) Chapter 1|url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/2708.htm|publisher=newadvent.org|accessdate=5 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 4th century, the [[Emperor Constantine I]] decided to honour Peter with [[St. Peter's Basilica|a large basilica]].&lt;ref name=CathEncy&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13374a.htm|title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Tomb of St. Peter|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/pope/hd_pope.htm|title=The Papacy and the Vatican Palace|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the precise location of Peter's burial was so firmly fixed in the belief of the Christians of Rome, the church to house the basilica had to be erected on a site that was not convenient to construction. The slope of the [[Vatican Hill]] had to be excavated, even though the church could much more easily have been built on level ground only slightly to the south. There were also moral and legal issues, such as demolishing a cemetery to make room for the building. The focal point of the Basilica, both in its original form and in its later complete reconstruction, is the altar located over what is said to be the point of Peter's burial.

According to a letter quoted by [[Bede]], [[Pope Vitalian]] sent a cross containing filings said to be from Peter's chains to the queen of [[Oswy]], [[Anglo-Saxon]] King of [[Northumbria]] in 665, as well as unspecified relics of the saint to the king.&lt;ref name="Wall"&gt;Wall, J.

In 1950, human bones were found buried underneath the altar of St. Peter's Basilica. The bones have been claimed by many to have been those of Peter.&lt;ref&gt;Walsh, ''The Bones of St. Peter: A 1st Full Account of the Search for the Apostle's Body''&lt;/ref&gt; An attempt to contradict these claims was made in 1953 by the excavation of what some believe to be [[Saint Peter's tomb|St Peter's tomb]] in Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;Finegan, ''The Archeology of the New Testament'', pp. 368–370.&lt;/ref&gt; However along with this supposed tomb in Jerusalem bearing his previous name Simon (but not Peter), tombs bearing the names of Jesus, Mary, James, John, and the rest of the apostles were also found at the same excavation—though all these names were very common among Jews at the time.

In the 1960s, items from the excavations beneath [[St Peter's Basilica]] were re-examined, and the bones of a male person were identified. A forensic examination found them to be a male of about 61 years of age from the 1st century. This caused Pope Paul VI in 1968 to announce them most likely to be the relics of Apostle Peter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saintpetersbasilica.org/Necropolis/JW/TheBonesofStPeter-1.htm |title=The Bones of St. Peter |publisher=Saintpetersbasilica.org |accessdate=2010-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 24, 2013, [[Pope Francis]] revealed these relics of nine bone fragments for the first time in public during a Mass celebrated in St. Peter's Square.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/24/vatican-st-peters-bones-display-pope-francis

According to the ''[[International Standard Bible Encyclopedia]]'', "The characteristics ascribed to this Babylon apply to Rome rather than to any other city of that age: (a) as ruling over the kings of the earth (Revelation 17:18); (b) as sitting on seven mountains (Revelation 17:9); (c) as the center of the world's merchandise (Revelation 18:3, 11–13); (d) as the corrupter of the nations (Revelation 17:2; 18:3; 19:2); (e) as the persecutor of the saints (Revelation 17:6)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.internationalstandardbible.com/B/babylon-in-the-new-testament.html|title=Babylon in the New Testament|work=International Standard Bible Encyclopedia Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At that time in history, the ancient city of Babylon was no longer of any importance.  E.g., [[Strabo]] wrote, "The greater part of Babylon is so deserted that one would not hesitate to say ... The Great City is a great desert."&lt;ref&gt;Strabo. Geography 16.1.5&lt;/ref&gt;

Another theory is that Babylon term refers to the [[Babylon (Egypt)|Babylon in Egypt]] that was an important [[Babylon Fortress|fortress city]] in Egypt, just north of today's Cairo and this, combined with the "greetings from Mark" (1 Peter 5:13), who may be [[Mark the Evangelist]], regarded as the founder of the [[Church of Alexandria]] (Egypt), has led some scholars to regard the First Peter epistle as having been written in Egypt.

Early Church tradition reports that Peter wrote from Rome.  Eusebius of Caesarea states:

{{quote|[[Clement of Alexandria]] in the sixth [book] of the Hypotyposeis cites the story, and the bishop of Hierapolis named [[Papias of Hierapolis|Papias]] joins him in testifying that Peter mentions Mark in the first epistle, which they say he composed in Rome herself, and that he indicates this, calling the city more figuratively Babylon by these: "She who is in Babylon, chosen together with you, sends you greetings and so does my son Mark. (1 Pet 5:13)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Eusebius|title=Church History Book II Chapter 15:2|url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/250102.htm|publisher=hypotyposeis.org &amp; newadvent.org|accessdate=4 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

If the reference is to Rome, it is the only biblical reference to Peter being there. Many scholars regard both First and Second Peter as not having been authored by him, partly because other parts of the [[Acts of the Apostles]] seem to describe Peter as an illiterate fisherman.&lt;ref name="Martin 2009" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Raymond E., ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=gk_uAAAAMAAJ Introduction to the New Testament]'', Anchor Bible, 1997, {{ISBN|0-385-24767-2}}. p. 767 "the pseudonymity of II Pet is more certain than that of any other NT work."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious interpretations==

===Catholic Church===
{{Main|Primacy of Simon Peter|Papal primacy}}
[[File:Statua di San Pietro realizzata da Giuseppe De Fabris - Piazza di San Pietro.jpg|thumb|left|Statue of St. Peter in [[St. Peter's Square]] at the Vatican]]

According to Catholic belief, Simon Peter was distinguished by Jesus to hold the [[Primacy of Simon Peter|first place of honor and authority]]. Also in Catholic belief, Peter was, as the first Bishop of Rome, the first [[Pope]]. Furthermore, they consider every Pope to be Peter's successor and the rightful superior of all other [[Bishop (Catholic Church)|bishops]].&lt;ref name=CEPope&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Pope|author=Joyce, G. H.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Peter never bore the title of "[[Pope]]", or "Vicar of Christ", in this sense the Catholic Church considers Peter the first Pope.&lt;ref&gt;Wilken, p. 281, quote: "Some (Christian communities) had been founded by Peter, the disciple Jesus designated as the founder of his church. ... Once the position was institutionalized, historians looked back and recognized Peter as the first pope of the Christian church in Rome"&lt;/ref&gt;

The Catholic Church's recognition of Peter as head of its church on Earth (with Christ being its [[heaven]]ly head) is based on its interpretation of two passages from the [[canonical gospels]] of the [[New Testament]]; as well as [[sacred tradition]]. The first passage is {{Bibleref2|John|21:15–17}} which is: "Feed my lambs... feed my lambs... feed my sheep" (within the Greek it is Ποίμαινε i.e., to feed and rule [as a Shepherd]., v. 16 while Βόσκε i.e., to feed., for v.15 &amp; v. 17)&lt;ref&gt;[http://tr.biblos.com/john/21.htm "Greek New Testament"] Greek New Testament. John xxi 11 Jun. 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;—which is seen by Catholics as Christ promising the spiritual supremacy to Peter. The ''Catholic Encyclopedia'' sees in this passage Jesus "charging [Peter] with the superintendency of all his sheep, without exception; and consequently of his whole flock, that is, of his own church".&lt;ref name= CEPope/&gt;

====Matthew 16:18====
The second passage is {{Bibleref2|Matthew|16:18}}:

{{quote|I tell you that you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of Hell will not overcome it. I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven; whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.|Matthew 16:18–19 (NIV)}}

Jesus could have said the following phrase in [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]], which could have spoken:&lt;ref name="aramaic"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia| encyclopedia =The Eerdmans Bible Dictionary|title=Aramaic|quote=It is generally agreed that Aramaic was the common language of Palestine in the first century AD.

It means a rock, the same as petra (It doesn't mean a little stone or a pebble) What Jesus said to Simon in Matthew 16:18 was this: 'You are Kepha, and on this kepha I will build my Church.'&lt;/ref&gt;

To better understand what Christ meant, St. Basil elaborates:&lt;ref name="Basil"&gt;Basil li. De poenit. cƒ. Matth. v. 14 ; Luke xxii. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Though Peter be a rock, yet he is not a rock as Christ is. For Christ is the true unmoveable rock of himself, Peter is unmoveable by Christ the rock.

You are the light: he is the Priest, and yet he 3. maketh Priests: he is the rock, and he made a rock.| Basil li. De poenit. cƒ. Matt. v. 14 ; Luke 22:19}}

In reference to Peter's occupation before becoming an Apostle, the popes wear the [[Fisherman's Ring]], which bears an image of the saint casting his nets from a fishing boat. The keys used as a symbol of the pope's authority refer to the "keys of the kingdom of Heaven" promised to Peter.{{Bibleref2c|Matt.|16:18–19}} The terminology of this "commission" of Peter is unmistakably parallel to the commissioning of Eliakim ben Hilkiah in {{Bibleref2|Isaiah|22:15–23}}. Peter is often depicted in both Western and Eastern Christian art holding a [[Key (lock)|key]] or a set of keys.

Though the authenticity of this account has been challenged, the general consensus is that these are Jesus' words.&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt;

====Feast days====
{{main|Feast of Saints Peter and Paul}}
The [[Roman Martyrology]] assigns 29 June as the [[Calendar of saints|feast day]] of both Peter and [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]], without thereby declaring that to be the day of their deaths. [[Augustine of Hippo]] says in his Sermon 295: "One day is assigned for the celebration of the martyrdom of the two apostles. But those two were one. Although their martyrdom occurred on different days, they were one."

This is also the feast of both [[Apostle (Christian)|Apostles]] in the calendar of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]].

In the [[Roman Rite]], the feast of the [[Chair of Saint Peter]] is celebrated on 22 February, and the anniversary of the dedication of the two [[Papal Basilica|papal basilicas]] of [[St. Peter's Basilica|Saint Peter's]] and [[Basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls|Saint Paul's outside the Walls]] is held on 18 November.

Before [[Pope John XXIII]]'s revision in 1960, the Roman Calendar also included on 18 January another feast of the Chair of Saint Peter (denominated the Chair of Saint Peter in Rome, while the February feast was then called that of the Chair of Saint Peter at Antioch), and on 1 August the feast of [[Liberation of Saint Peter|Saint Peter in Chains]].

====Meaning of Matthew 16:18====
In the original [[Greek language|Greek]] the word translated as "Peter" is ''Πέτρος'' (Petros) and that translated as "rock" is ''πέτρα'' (petra), two words that, while not identical, give an impression of one of many times when Jesus used a play on words. Furthermore, since Jesus presumably spoke to Peter in their native [[Aramaic language]], he would have used ''kepha'' in both instances.&lt;ref name="keating"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.catholic.com/tracts/peter-the-rock |title=Peter the Rock |publisher=Catholic.com |date=2004-08-10 |accessdate=2010-09-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111119034546/http://www.catholic.com/tracts/peter-the-rock |archivedate=19 November 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peshitta|The Peshitta Text]] and [[Peshitta#Old Syriac texts|the Old Syriac texts]] use the word "kepha" for both "Peter" and "rock" in {{Bibleref2|Matthew|16:18}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.peshitta.org/pdf/Mattich16.pdf |format=PDF |chapter=The Preaching of Mattai, chapter 16 |title=Peshitta Aramaic/English Interlinear New Testament |accessdate=2014-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{Bibleref2|John|1:42}} says Jesus called Simon "Cephas", as Paul calls him in some letters. He was instructed by Christ to strengthen his brethren, i.e., the apostles.{{Bibleref2c|Lk|22:31–32}} Peter also had a leadership role in the early Christian church at Jerusalem according to The Acts of the Apostles chapters 1–2, 10–11, and 15.

Early Catholic Latin and Greek writers (such as St. [[John Chrysostom]]) considered the "foundation rock" as applying to both Peter personally and his confession of faith (or the faith of his confession) symbolically, as well as seeing Christ's promise to apply more generally to his twelve apostles and the Church at large.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title="Peter's Primacy in the New Testament and the Early Tradition" in The Primacy of Peter|author=Veselin Kesich|year=1992|publisher=St. Vladimir's Seminary Press| pages= 61–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; This "double meaning" interpretation is present in the current [[Catechism of the Catholic Church]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Catechism of the Catholic Church]], Articles 424 and 552&lt;/ref&gt;

Protestant counter-claims to the Catholic interpretation are largely based on the difference between the Greek words translated "Rock" in the Matthean passage. In popular-level writings, rather than in academic studies, they claim that in classical [[Attic Greek]] ''petros'' (masculine) generally meant "pebble", while ''petra'' (feminine) meant "boulder" or "cliff", and accordingly, taking Peter's name to mean "pebble," they argue that the "rock" in question cannot have been Peter, but something else, either Jesus himself, or the faith in Jesus that Peter had just professed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://spectrummagazine.org/article/2017/03/30/becoming-pebble-name-god-gave-simon Spectrum Magazine: On Becoming a Pebble: The Name God Gave Simon]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.romancatholicism.co.uk/petrospetra.html Did Jesus really say he would build his church on Peter? Petros or Petra?]&lt;/ref&gt; These popular-level writings are rebutted in similar popular-level Catholic writings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://patrickmadrid.blogspot.gr/2009/02/bam-bam-pebbles-argument-goes-down.html Patrick Madrid, Bam! Bam! The "Pebbles" Argument Goes Down] or [https://www.catholic.com/tract/peter-the-rock Catholic Answers Magazine, Peter the Rock]&lt;/ref&gt;

The New Testament was written in [[Koiné Greek]], not Attic Greek, and some authorities say no significant difference existed between the meanings of ''petros'' and ''petra''. So far from meaning a pebble was the word ''petros'' that [[Apollonius Rhodius]] a writer of Koiné Greek of the third century B.C., used it to refer to "a huge round ''boulder'', a terrible quoit of [[Ares]] [[Enyalius]]; four stalwart youths could not have raised it from the ground even a little".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theoi.com/Text/ApolloniusRhodius3.html translation by R.C. Seaton] of [[Apollonius Rhodius]], ''[[Argonautica]]'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0227%3Abook%3D3%3Acard%3D1245 3:1365–1367]:
:λάζετο δ᾽ ἐκ πεδίοιο μέγαν περιηγέα ''πέτρον'', 
:δεινὸν Ἐνυαλίου σόλον Ἄρεος: οὔ κέ μιν ἄνδρες 
:αἰζηοὶ πίσυρες γαίης ἄπο τυτθὸν ἄειραν.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gesupietrochiave.jpg|thumb|Christ Handing the Keys to St Peter, by [[Pietro Perugino]] (1481–82)]]
The feminine noun ''petra'' (πέτρα in Greek), translated as ''rock'' in the phrase "on this rock I will build my church", is also used at {{Bibleref2|1Cor|10:4||1 Cor. 10:4}} in describing Jesus Christ, which reads: "They all ate the same spiritual food and drank the same spiritual drink; for they drank from the spiritual rock that accompanied them, and that rock was Christ."

Although {{Bibleref2|Matthew|16}} is used as a primary proof-text for the Catholic doctrine of Papal supremacy, some Protestant scholars say that prior to the Reformation of the 16th century, Matthew 16 was very rarely used to support papal claims, despite it being well documented as being used in the 3rd century by Stephen of Rome against Cyprian of Carriage in a "passionate disagreement" about baptism and in the 4th century by Pope Damasus as a claim to primacy as a lesson of the Arian Controversy for stricter discipline and centralized control.&lt;ref&gt;[[Chadwick, The Early Christian Church. p.237 p.238]]&lt;/ref&gt; Their position is that most of the early and medieval Church interpreted the 'rock' as being a reference either to Christ or to Peter's faith, not Peter himself. They understand Jesus' remark to have been his affirmation of Peter's testimony that Jesus was the Son of God.&lt;ref&gt;Mathison, Keith A., [https://books.google.com/books?id=w_PHAGr2TfgC ''The Shape of Sola Scriptura''], pp. 184–5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite this claim, many Fathers saw a connection between Matthew 16:18 and the primacy of Peter and his office, such as [[Tertullian]], writing: ''the Lord said to Peter, 'On this rock I will build my Church, I have given you the keys of the kingdom of heaven [and] whatever you shall have bound or loosed on earth will be bound or loosed in heaven' [Matt. 16:18–19]. . . . Upon you, he says, I will build my Church; and I will give to you the keys, not to the Church.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholic.com/tracts/peters-primacy|title=Peter's Primacy|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121018060632/http://www.catholic.com/tracts/peters-primacy|archivedate=18 October 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====What did Peter begin?====
Other theologically conservative Christians, including [[Confessional Lutherans]], also rebut comments made by Karl Keating and D.A. Carson who claim that there is no distinction between the words ''petros'' and ''petra'' in Koine Greek. The Lutheran theologians state that the dictionaries of [[Koine Greek|Koine/NT Greek]], including the authoritative&lt;ref&gt;Rykle Borger, "Remarks of an Outsider about Bauer's Worterbuch, BAGD, BDAG, and Their Textual Basis," Biblical Greek Language and Lexicography: Essays in Honor of Frederick W. Danker, Bernard A. Tayler (et al. eds.) pp. 32–47.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bauer lexicon|Bauer-Danker-Arndt-Gingrich Lexicon]], indeed list both words and the passages that give different meanings for each. The Lutheran theologians further note that:

{{quote|We honor Peter and in fact some of our churches are named after him, but he was not the first pope, nor was he Roman Catholic. If you read his first letter, you will see that he did not teach a Roman hierarchy, but that all Christians are royal priests.

[[File:Dirck van Baburen Saint Peter.jpg|thumb|''Saint Peter'' by [[Dirck van Baburen]]]] 
[[Oscar Cullmann]], a Lutheran theologian and distinguished Church historian, disagrees with Luther and the Protestant reformers who held that by "rock" Christ did not mean Peter, but meant either himself or the faith of His followers. He believes the meaning of the original Aramaic is very clear: that "Kepha" was the Aramaic word for "rock", and that it was also the name by which Christ called Peter.&lt;ref name=Time/&gt;

Yet, Cullmann sharply rejects the Catholic claim that Peter began the papal succession. He writes: "In the life of Peter there is no starting point for a chain of succession to the leadership of the church at large." While he believes the Matthew text is entirely valid and is in no way spurious, he says it cannot be used as "warrant of the papal succession."&lt;ref name=Time&gt;{{Cite news|author=Monday, Dec. 07, 1953 |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,890753-1,00.html |title=Religion: Peter &amp; the Rock |publisher=TIME |date=1953-12-07 |accessdate=2010-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cullmann concludes that while Peter ''was'' the original head of the apostles, Peter was not the founder of any visible church succession.&lt;ref name=Time/&gt;

There are other Protestant scholars who also partially defend the historical Catholic position about "Rock."&lt;ref&gt;D. A. Carson in ''The Expositor's Bible Commentary'' (Grand Rapids: Zondervan, 1984).&lt;/ref&gt; Taking a somewhat different approach from Cullman, they point out that the Gospel of Matthew was not written in the classical Attic form of Greek, but in the Hellenistic [[Koine Greek|Koine dialect]] in which there is no distinction in meaning between ''petros'' and ''petra''. Moreover, even in Attic Greek, in which the regular meaning of ''petros'' was a smallish "stone," there are instances of its use to refer to larger rocks, as in [[Sophocles]], ''[[Oedipus at Colonus]]'' v. 1595, where ''petros'' refers to a boulder used as a landmark, obviously something more than a pebble. In any case, a ''petros''/''petra'' distinction is irrelevant considering the Aramaic language in which the phrase might well have been spoken. In Greek, of any period, the feminine noun ''petra'' could not be used as the given name of a male, which may explain the use of ''Petros'' as the Greek word with which to translate Aramaic ''Kepha''.&lt;ref name="keating" /&gt;

Yet, still other Protestant scholars believe that Jesus in fact ''did'' mean to single out Peter as the very rock which he will build upon, but that the passage does nothing to indicate a continued succession of Peter's implied position. They assert that Matthew uses the demonstrative pronoun ''taute'', which allegedly means "this very" or ''this same'', when he refers to the rock on which Jesus' church will be built. He also uses the Greek word for "and", ''kai''. It is alleged that when a demonstrative pronoun is used with ''kai'', the pronoun refers back to the preceding noun. The second rock Jesus refers to must then be the same rock as the first one; and if Peter is the first rock he must also be the second.&lt;ref&gt;''Jesus, Peter &amp; the Keys: A Scriptural Handbook on the Papacy''&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike Oscar Cullmann, [[Confessional Lutherans]] and many other Protestant apologists agree that it's meaningless to elaborate the meaning of ''Rock'' by looking at the Aramaic language, this is true that the Jews spoke mostly Aramaic at home, however in public they usually spoke Greek. The few Aramaic words spoken by Jesus in public were unusual and that is why they are noted as such. And most importantly the New Testament was revealed in Koine Greek, ''not'' Aramaic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wlsessays.net/files/GawrischDoctrine.pdf ''The Doctrine of Church and Ministry in the Life of the Church Today''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150203191915/http://www.wlsessays.net/files/GawrischDoctrine.pdf |date=3 February 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wlsessays.net/files/BalgeMinistry.pdf ''Cross-Cultural And Multicultural Ministry In the New Testament''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150203192344/http://www.wlsessays.net/files/BalgeMinistry.pdf |date=3 February 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.graceway.com/articles/article_017.html|title=SOME THOUGHTS ON MATTHEW 16:18|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lutheran historians even report that the Catholic church itself didn't, at least unanimously, regard Peter as the ''Rock'' until the 1870s:

{{quote|Rome's rule for explaining the Scriptures and determining doctrine is the [[Profession of faith (Catholic Church)#Tridentine Creed|Creed]] of [[Pius IV]]. This Creed binds Rome to explain the Scriptures only according to the unanimous consent of the Fathers. In the year 1870 when the Fathers gathered and the pope declared his infallibility, the cardinals were not in agreement on Matthew 16, 18. They had five different interpretations. Seventeen insisted, Peter is the rock. Sixteen held that Christ is the rock. Eight were emphatic that the whole apostolic college is the rock. Forty-four said, Peter's faith is the rock, The remainder looked upon the whole body of believers as the rock. — And yet Rome taught and still teaches that Peter is the rock.&lt;ref name=WLS-Eckert&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wlsessays.net/files/EckertSpecific.pdf |title=The Specific Functions of the Church in the World |last1=Eckert |first1=Harold H. |publisher=Wisconsin Lutheran Seminary |accessdate=4 Feb 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150203182715/http://www.wlsessays.net/files/EckertSpecific.pdf |archivedate=3 February 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Eastern Orthodox===
[[File:Icon c 1500 Peter.JPG|thumb|upright=0.6|left|Icon of Saint Peter, c 1500]] 
The [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] regards Apostle Peter, together with Apostle Paul, as "Preeminent Apostles". Another title used for Peter is ''Coryphaeus'', which could be translated as "Choir-director", or lead singer.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Meyendorff]], et al. (1963), ''The Primacy of Peter in the Orthodox Church'' ([[St. Vladimir's Seminary]] Press, Crestwood NY, {{ISBN|978-0-88141-125-6}})&lt;/ref&gt; The church recognizes Apostle Peter's leadership role in the [[early church]], especially in the very early days at Jerusalem, but does not consider him to have had any "princely" role over his fellow Apostles.

The New Testament is not seen by the Orthodox as supporting any extraordinary authority for Peter with regard to faith or morals. The Orthodox also hold that Peter did not act as leader at the [[Council of Jerusalem]], but as merely one of a number who spoke. The final decision regarding the non-necessity of [[circumcision]] (and certain prohibitions) was spelled out by [[James, the Brother of the Lord]] (though Catholics hold James merely reiterated and fleshed out what Peter had said, regarding the latter's earlier divine revelation regarding the inclusion of Gentiles).

Eastern and Oriental Orthodox do not recognize the Bishop of Rome as the successor of St. Peter but the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople]] sends a delegation each year to Rome to participate in the celebration of the feast of Sts. Peter and Paul. In the [[declaration of Ravenna|Ravenna Document]] of 13 October 2007, the representatives of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] agreed that "Rome, as the Church that 'presides in love' according to the phrase of St. Ignatius of Antioch (To the Romans, Prologue), occupied the first place in the ''taxis'', and that the bishop of Rome was therefore the ''protos'' among the patriarchs, if the Papacy unites with the Orthodox Church. They disagree, however, on the interpretation of the historical evidence from this era regarding the prerogatives of the bishop of Rome as ''protos'', a matter that was already understood in different ways in the first millennium."

With regard to Jesus' words to Peter, "Thou art Peter and upon this rock I will build my church", the Orthodox hold Christ is referring to the confession of faith, ''not'' the person of Peter as that upon which he will build the church. This is allegedly shown by the fact that the original Greek uses the feminine demonstrative pronoun when he says "upon this rock" (ταύτῃ τῇ πέτρᾳ); whereas, grammatically, if he had been referring to Peter, he would allegedly have used the masculine.&lt;ref&gt;Holy Apostles Convent (1999) ''The Orthodox New Testament'', Vol. I: The Holy Gospels (Dormition Skete, Buena Vista CO, {{ISBN|0-944359-13-2}}) p. 105&lt;/ref&gt; This "gender distinction" argument is also held by some Protestants.

====Feast days====
In the Orthodox [[Daily Office]] every Thursday throughout the year is dedicated to the Holy Apostles, including St. Peter. There are also two [[feast day]]s in the year which are dedicated to him:

* June 29, [[Feast of Saints Peter and Paul]]—This is a major feast day and is preceded by a period of Lenten fasting known as the [[Apostles' Fast]]
* January 16, [[Liberation of Saint Peter|Veneration of the Precious Chains of the Holy and All-Glorious Apostle Peter]]—commemorating both the chains which {{Bibleref2|Acts|12:1–11}} says miraculously fell from him, and the chains in which he was held before his [[martyr]]dom by [[Nero]].

===Syriac Orthodox Church===
[[File:Antonio de Bellis - La liberazione di San Pietro.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|''Saint Peter and the angel'', by [[Antonio de Bellis]] ]] 
The Fathers of the Syriac Orthodox Church tried to give a theological interpretation to the primacy of Apostle Peter. They were fully convinced of the unique office of Peter in the primitive Christian community. [[Ephrem the Syrian|Ephrem]], [[Aphrahat]] and [[Maruthas]] who were supposed to have been the best exponents of the early [[Syriac Christianity|Syriac tradition]] unequivocally acknowledge the office of Peter.

The Syriac Fathers, following the rabbinic tradition, call Jesus "Kepha" for they see "rock" in the Old Testament as a messianic Symbol (yet the Old Maronite Syriacs of Lebanon still refer to Saint Peter as "Saint Simon the Generous" or Simon Karam"). When Christ gave his own name "Kepha" to Simon he was giving him participation in the person and office of Christ. Christ who is the Kepha and shepherd made Simon the chief shepherd in his place and gave him the very name Kepha and said that on Kepha he would build the Church. [[Aphrahat]] shared the common Syriac tradition. For him Kepha is in fact another name of Jesus, and Simon was given the right to share the name. The person who receives somebody else's name also obtains the rights of the person who bestows the name. Aphrahat makes the stone taken from Jordan a type of Peter. He wrote: "Jesus son of Nun set up the stones for a witness in Israel; Jesus our Saviour called Simon Kepha Sarirto and set him as the faithful witness among nations".

Again he wrote in his commentary on [[Deuteronomy]] that [[Moses]] brought forth water from "rock" (Kepha) for the people and Jesus sent Simon Kepha to carry his teachings among nations. God accepted him and made him the foundation of the Church and called him Kepha. When he speaks about the transfiguration of Christ he calls him [[Simon Peter]], the foundation of the Church. Ephrem also shared the same view. In the Armenian version of [[De Virginitate]] records that [[Peter the rock]] shunned honour. In a ''mimro'' of Efrem found in Holy Week Liturgy points to the importance of Peter.

Both [[Aphrahat]] and [[Ephrem the Syrian|Ephrem]] represent the authentic tradition of the Syrian Church. The different orders of liturgies used for sanctification of Church buildings, marriage, ordination etcetera, reveal that the primacy of Peter is a part of living faith of the Church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.syrianchurch.org/Articles/PrimacyofStPeter.htm |title="Primacy of St. Peter" – by Dr. Thomas Athanasius |publisher=Syrianchurch.org |date= |accessdate=2010-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Apostolic Church===
The [[New Apostolic Church]], who believes in the re-established Apostle ministry, sees Peter as the first [[Chief Apostle]].

===Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints===
[[File:Saint Peter by Grão Vasco.jpg|thumb|''Saint Peter'' by [[Grão Vasco|Vasco Fernandes]]]]

[[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) teaches that Peter was the first leader of the early Christian church after the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. While Mormons accept apostolic succession from Peter, they reject papal successors as illegitimate.

In interpreting {{Bibleref2|Matthew|16:13–19}}, LDS Church leader [[Bruce R. McConkie]] stated, "The things of God are known only by the power of his Spirit,"&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first= Bruce R. |last= McConkie |author-link= Bruce R.

===Islam===
{{Main|Peter in Islam}}
[[Muslim]]s consider [[Jesus]] a [[prophet]] of God. The [[Qur'an]] also speaks of Jesus's disciples but does not mention their names, instead referring to them as "helpers to the [[Prophets in Islam|prophet of God]]".&lt;ref&gt;Qur'an 3:49–53&lt;/ref&gt; Muslim exegesis and [[Qur'an]] commentary, however, names them and includes Peter among the disciples.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''Historical Dictionary of Prophets In Islam And Judaism'', Brandon M. Wheeler, ''Disciples of Christ'': "Muslim exegesis identifies the disciples as Peter, Andrew, Matthew, Thomas, Philip, John, James, Bartholomew, and Simon"&lt;/ref&gt; An old tradition, which involves the legend of [[Habib the Carpenter]], mentions that Peter was one of the three disciples sent to [[Antioch]] to preach to the people there.&lt;ref&gt;''Hughes Dictionary of Islam'', ''Habib the Carpenter''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Shia]] [[Muslim]]s see a parallel in the figure of Peter to [[Ali]] at [[Muhammad in Islam|Muhammad]]'s time. They look upon Ali as being the [[vicegerent]], with [[Muhammad]] being the [[prophet]]; likewise, they see Peter as the [[vicegerent]], behind [[Jesus in Islam|Jesus]] the [[prophet]] and [[Masih]]. Peter's role as the first proper leader of the church is also seen by Shias to be a parallel to their belief in Ali as the first [[caliph]] after Muhammad.&lt;ref&gt;''[[No god but God: The Origins, Evolution, and Future of Islam]]'', [[Reza Aslan]], Dictionary: ''Simon Peter''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bahá'í Faith===
In his ''[[Advent of Divine Justice]],'' [[Shoghi Effendi]], the [[Guardian (Bahá'í Faith)|Guardian]] of the [[Bahá'í Faith]], refers to Peter:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Shoghi |last=Effendi |authorlink=Shoghi Effendi |year=1938 |title=The Advent of Divine Justice |publisher=Bahá'í Publishing Trust |location=Wilmette, Illinois, USA |isbn=0-87743-195-7  | chapter = Dearly beloved friends!

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Peter," [['Abdu'l-Bahá]] has testified, "according to the history of the Church, was also incapable of keeping count of the days of the week. Whenever he decided to go fishing, he would tie up his weekly food into seven parcels, and every day he would eat one of them, and when he had reached the seventh, he would know that the Sabbath had arrived, and thereupon would observe it." If the Son of Man was capable of infusing into apparently so crude and helpless an instrument such potency as to cause, in the words of [[Bahá'u'lláh]], "the mysteries of wisdom and of utterance to flow out of his mouth," and to exalt him above the rest of His disciples, and render him fit to become His successor and the founder of His Church, how much more can the Father, Who is Bahá'u'lláh, empower the most puny and insignificant among His followers to achieve, for the execution of His purpose, such wonders as would dwarf the mightiest achievements of even the first apostle of Jesus Christ!&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Writings==
Traditionally, two canonical epistles ([[1 Peter|1]] and [[2 Peter]]) and several apocryphal works have been attributed to Peter.

===New Testament===
[[File:Francesco del Cossa 017.jpg|thumb|upright|St Peter painted by [[Francesco del Cossa]]]]

====Epistles====
{{main|Authorship of the Petrine epistles}}

The [[New Testament]] includes two letters (''epistles'') ascribed to Peter. Both demonstrate a high quality of cultured and urban Greek, at odds with the linguistic skill that would ordinarily be expected of an [[Aramaic]]-speaking fisherman, who would have learned Greek as a second or third language. The textual features of these two epistles are such that a majority of scholars doubt that they were written by the same hand. Some scholars argue that theological differences imply different sources, and point to the lack of references to 2&amp;nbsp;Peter among the early Church Fathers.

[[Daniel B. Wallace]] (who maintains that Peter was the author) writes that, for many scholars, "the issue of authorship is already settled, at least negatively: the apostle Peter did not write this letter" and that "the vast bulk of NT scholars adopts this perspective without much discussion". However, he later states, "Although a very strong case has been made against Petrine authorship of 2 Peter, we believe it is deficient... Taken together, these external and internal arguments strongly suggest the traditional view, viz., that Peter was indeed the author of the second epistle which bears his name."&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20031209164253/http://www.bible.org/docs/soapbox/2petotl.htm ''Second Peter: Introduction, Argument, and Outline'']. Archive date: 9 December 2003. Access date: 19 August 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the two epistles, the [[First Epistle of Peter|first epistle]] is considered the earlier. A number of scholars have argued that the textual discrepancies with what would be expected of the biblical Peter are due to it having been written with the help of a secretary or as an [[amanuensis]].&lt;ref name="ce-epistles"&gt;{{cathEncy|wstitle=Epistles of St. Peter|volume=11|author=Vander Heeren, Achille}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jerome]] explains:

{{quote|The two Epistles attributed to St. Peter differ in style, character, and the construction of the words, which proves that according to the exigencies of the moment St. Peter made use of different interpreters ''(Epistle 120 – To Hedibia)''&lt;ref name="Jerome"&gt;{{cite web|last1=saint|first1=Jerome|title=Epistle 120 – To Hedibia Question 11|url=http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/jerome_hedibia_2_trans.htm|publisher=tertullian.org|accessdate=9 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Some have seen a reference to the use of a secretary in the sentence: "By Silvanus, a faithful brother unto you, as I suppose, I have written briefly, exhorting, and testifying that this is the true grace of God wherein ye stand".{{Bibleref2c|1Pet|5:12|ESV|1 Pet. 5:12}} However New Testament scholar [[Bart D. Ehrman]] in his 2011 book ''Forged'' states that "scholars now widely recognize that when the author indicates that he wrote the book 'through Silvanus', he is indicating not the name of his secretary, but the person who was carrying his letter to the recipients."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ehrman |first1=Bart D. |authorlink1=Bart D. Ehrman |title= Forged|year= 2011|publisher=HarperOne, [[HarperCollins]] |isbn=978-0-06-201262-3 |page=76}}&lt;/ref&gt; The letter refers to Roman persecution of Christians, apparently of an official nature. The Roman historian [[Tacitus]] and the biographer [[Suetonius]] do both record that Nero persecuted Christians, and Tacitus dates this to immediately after the fire that burned Rome in 64. Christian tradition, for example Eusebius of Caesarea (''History'' book 2, 24.1), has maintained that Peter was killed in Nero's persecution, and thus had to assume that the Roman persecution alluded to in First Peter must be this Neronian persecution.&lt;ref name="ce-epistles"/&gt; On the other hand, many modern scholars argue that First Peter refers to the persecution of Christians in Asia Minor during the reign of the emperor [[Domitian]] (81–96), as the letter is explicitly addressed to Jewish Christians from that region:

{{quote|Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to God's elect, strangers in the world, scattered throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia and Bithynia, who have been chosen according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, through the sanctifying work of the Spirit, for obedience to Jesus Christ and sprinkling by his blood: Grace and peace be yours in abundance.{{Bibleref2c|1Pet|1:1–2}}}}

Those scholars who believe that the epistle dates from the time of Domitian argue that Nero's persecution of Christians was confined to the city of Rome itself, and did not extend to the Asian provinces mentioned in 1 Pet 1:1–2.
 
The [[Second Epistle of Peter]], on the other hand, appears to have been copied, in part, from the [[Epistle of Jude]], and some modern scholars date its composition as late as ''c.'' 150. Some scholars argue the opposite, that the Epistle of Jude copied Second Peter, while others contend an early date for Jude and thus observe that an early date is not incompatible with the text.&lt;ref name="ce-epistles"/&gt; Many scholars have noted the similarities between the [[apocrypha]]l [[Second Epistle of Clement]] (2nd century) and Second Peter. Second Peter may be earlier than 150, there are a few possible references to it that date back to the 1st century or early 2nd century, e.g., [[1 Clement]] written in ''c.'' AD 96, and the later church historian Eusebius wrote that [[Origen]] had made reference to the epistle before 250. 
&lt;ref name="ce-epistles"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Eusebius|title=Church History Book VI, Chapter 25|url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/250106.htm|publisher=newadvent.org|accessdate=11 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jerome says that Peter "wrote two epistles which are called Catholic, the second of which, on account of its difference from the first in style, is considered by many not to be by him". ''(De Viris Illustribus 1)''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=saint|first1=Jerome|title=De Viris Illustribus (On Illustrious Men) Chapter 1|url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/2708.htm|publisher=newadvent.org|accessdate=9 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; But he himself received the epistle, and explained the difference in style and character and structure of words by the assumption that Peter used different interpreters in the composition of the two epistles;&lt;ref name="Jerome" /&gt; and from his time onward the epistle was generally regarded as a part of the New Testament.

Even in early times there was controversy over its authorship, and Second Peter was often not included in the [[biblical canon]]; it was only in the 4th century that it gained a firm foothold in the New Testament, in a series of synods. In the east the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]] still did not admit it into the canon until the 6th century.&lt;ref name="ce-epistles"/&gt;

====Mark====
Traditionally, the [[Gospel of Mark#Authorship and sources|Gospel of Mark]] was said to have been written by a person named [[John Mark]], and that this person was an assistant to Peter, hence its content was traditionally seen as the closest to Peter's viewpoint. According to Eusebius' ''|Ecclesiastical History'', [[Papias of Hierapolis|Papias]] recorded this belief from [[John the Presbyter]]:

{{quote|Mark having become the interpreter of Peter, wrote down accurately whatsoever he remembered. It was not, however, in exact order that he related the sayings or deeds of Christ. For he neither heard the Lord nor accompanied Him. But afterwards, as I said, he accompanied Peter, who accommodated his instructions to the necessities [of his hearers], but with no intention of giving a normal or chronological narrative of the Lord's sayings. Wherefore Mark made no mistake in thus writing some things as he remembered them. For of one thing he took especial care, not to omit anything he had heard, and not to put anything fictional into the statements&lt;ref&gt;Eusebius,'' Ecclesiastical History'', 3.39.14–16&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Clement of Alexandria in the fragments of his work ''Hypotyposes (A.D. 190)'' preserved and cited by the historian Eusebius in his Church History (VI, 14: 6) writes that:

{{quote|As Peter had preached the Word publicly at Rome, and declared the Gospel by the Spirit, many who were present requested that [[Mark the Evangelist|Mark]], who had followed him for a long time and remembered his sayings, should write them out. And having composed the Gospel he gave it to those who had requested it.&lt;ref name="CL" /&gt;}}

Also Irenaeus wrote about this tradition:

{{quote|After their (Peter and Paul's) passing, Mark also, the disciple and interpreter of Peter, transmitted to us in writing the things preached by Peter.&lt;ref&gt;Irenaeus, ''Against Heresies'', III. 1.2.; quoted by Eusebius in ''Ecclesiastical History'', book 5, 7.6&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Based on these quotes, and on the Christian tradition, the information in Mark's gospel about Peter would be based on eyewitness material.&lt;ref name="ce-epistles"/&gt; The gospel itself is [[Anonymous work|anonymous]], and the above passages are the oldest surviving written testimony to its authorship.&lt;ref name="ce-epistles"/&gt;

===Pseudepigrapha and apocrypha===
[[File:Muenster-100725-15996-Überwasserkirche-Schlüssel.jpg|thumb|upright=0.55|The [[Key (lock)|key]] as symbol of St. Peter]]
There are also a number of other [[apocrypha]]l writings, that have been either attributed to or written about Peter. These include:

*[[Gospel of Peter]], a partially [[docetism|Docetic]] narrative that has survived in part
*[[Acts of Peter]]
*[[Acts of Peter and Andrew]]
*[[Acts of Peter and Paul]]
*[[Acts of Peter and the Twelve]]
*[[Gnostic Apocalypse of Peter]]
*A [[Letter of Peter to Philip]], which was preserved in the [[Nag Hammadi library]]
*[[Apocalypse of Peter]], which was considered as genuine by many Christians as late as the 4th century
*The Epistula Petri, the introductory letter ascribed to the Apostle Peter that appears at the beginning of at least one version of the [[Clementine literature]]

===Non-canonical sayings of Peter===
[[File:Bouts third-appearance.jpg|thumb|[[Miraculous catch of fish]]]]
Two sayings are attributed to Peter in the gnostic [[Gospel of Thomas]]. In the first, Peter compares Jesus to a "just messenger."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.misericordia.edu/users/davies/thomas/Trans.htm |title=Gospel of Thomas 13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070813204310/http://www.misericordia.edu/users/davies/thomas/Trans.htm |archivedate=13 August 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the second, Peter asks Jesus to "make Mary leave us, for females don't deserve life."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.misericordia.edu/users/davies/thomas/Trans.htm |title=Gospel of Thomas 114 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070813204310/http://www.misericordia.edu/users/davies/thomas/Trans.htm |archivedate=13 August 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Apocalypse of Peter]], Peter holds a dialogue with Jesus about the [[parable of the fig tree]] and the fate of [[sinners]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/apocalypsepeter-mrjames.html |title=Apocalypse of Peter}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Gospel of Mary]], whose text is largely fragmented, Peter appears to be jealous of "Mary" (probably [[Mary Magdalene]]). He says to the other disciples, "Did He really speak privately with a woman and not openly to us? Are we to turn about and all listen to her? Did He prefer her to us?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gnosis.org/library/marygosp.htm |title=Gospel of Mary 9:4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In reply to this, Levi says "Peter, you have always been hot tempered."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gnosis.org/library/marygosp.htm |title=Gospel of Mary 9:6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other noncanonical texts that attribute sayings to Peter include the [[Secret Book of James]] and the [[Acts of Peter]].

In the [[Fayyum Fragment]], which dates to the end of the 3rd century, Jesus predicts that Peter will deny him three times before a [[Rooster|cock]] crows on the following morning. The account is similar to that of the canonical gospels, especially the [[Gospel of Mark]]. It is unclear whether the fragment is an abridged version of the accounts in the [[synoptic gospels]], or a source text on which they were based, perhaps the apocryphal Gospel of Peter.&lt;ref&gt;''Das Evangelium nach Petrus. Text, Kontexte, Intertexte.'' Edited by Thomas J. Kraus and Tobias Nicklas. (Texte und Untersuchungen zur Geschichte der altchristlichen Literatur. Archiv für die Ausgabe der Griechischen Christlichen Schiftsteller der ersten Jahrhunderte (TU), 158.) VIII-384 pages. Berlin–New York: [[Walter de Gruyter]], 2007. {{ISBN|978-3-11-019313-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The fragmentary [[Gospel of Peter]] contains an account of the death of Jesus differing significantly from the canonical gospels. It contains little information about Peter himself, except that after the discovery of the [[empty tomb]], "I, Simon Peter, and Andrew my brother, took our fishing nets and went to the sea."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cygnus-study.com/pagepet.html |title=Gospel of Peter 14:3 |publisher=Cygnus-study.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090917093938/http://www.cygnus-study.com/pagepet.html |archivedate=17 September 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Iconography==
[[File:Altar piece of Taulumäki Church by Eero Järnefelt.JPG|thumb|''Saint Peter sinking on water'' by [[Eero Järnefelt]]]]
The earliest portrait of Peter dates back to the 4th century and was located in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/europe/06/22/italy.apostles.images/ |title=Oldest known images of apostles found |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website=CNN.com |publisher= |accessdate=17 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In traditional [[iconography]], Peter has been shown very consistently since [[early Christian art]] as an oldish thick-set man with a "slightly combative" face and a short beard, and usually white hair, sometimes balding. He thus contrasts with [[Paul the Apostle]] who is bald except at the sides, with a longer beard and often black hair, and thinner in the face. One exception to this is in [[Anglo-Saxon art]], where he typically lacks a beard. Both Peter and Paul are shown thus as early as the 4th century [[Catacombs of Marcellinus and Peter]] in Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Higgitt, John, "The Iconography of Saint Peter in Anglo-Saxon England, and Saint Cuthbert's Coffin", pp. 267–272, 270 quoted, in: Bonner, Gerald, Rollason, David &amp; Stancliffe, Clare, eds., ''St. Cuthbert, his Cult and his Community to AD 1200''. Woodbridge: Boydell and Brewer, 1989 {{ISBN|0-85115-610-X}} {{ISBN|9780851156101}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=3jPRV2hUGE8C&amp;pg=PA268#v=onepage&amp;q=%22levis%20theca%22&amp;f=false google books]&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the Middle Ages his [[emblem|attribute]] is one or two large keys in his hand or hanging from his belt, first seen in the early 8th century.&lt;ref&gt;Higgitt, p. 276&lt;/ref&gt; More than many medieval attributes, this continued to be depicted in the Renaissance and afterwards. By the 15th century Peter is more likely to be bald on the top of his head in the Western church, but he continues to have a good head of hair in Orthodox icons.

The depiction of Saint Peter as literally the keeper of the gates of heaven, popular with modern cartoonists, is not found in traditional religious art, but Peter usually heads groups of saints flanking God in heaven, on the right hand side (viewer's left) of God. Narrative images of Peter include several scenes from the ''[[Life of Christ in art|Life of Christ]]'' where he is mentioned in the gospels, and he is often identifiable in scenes where his presence is not specifically mentioned. Usually he stands nearest to Christ. In particular, depictions of the ''[[Arrest of Christ]]'' usually include Peter cutting off the ear of one of the soldiers. Scenes without Jesus include his distinctive martyrdom, his rescue from prison, and sometimes his trial. In the [[Counter-Reformation]] scenes of Peter hearing the cock crow for the third time became popular, as a representation of [[repentance]] and hence the Catholic [[sacrament]] of [[Confession (sacrament)|Confession]] or Repentance.

==Revisionist views==

Many Protestant scholars accept the traditional story of Peter's martyrdom in Rome. Some Protestants, however, have rejected Peter's martyrdom as a later invention, arguing that evidence of Peter exists only in biblical accounts.

It has also been suggested that there was a serious division between Peter's [[Jewish Christian]] party and Paul's Hellenizing party, seen in e.g. the [[Incident at Antioch]], which later Christian accounts have downplayed.&lt;ref&gt;White, L. Michael (2004). From Jesus to Christianity. HarperSanFrancisco. pp. 170. {{ISBN|0-06-052655-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another revisionist view was developed by supporters of the [[Christ myth theory]], which holds that the figure of Peter is largely a development from some mythological doorkeeper figures. According to [[Arthur Drews]] and [[George Albert Wells|G. A. Wells]], if there was a historical Peter, then all that is known about him is the brief mentions in Galatians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.egodeath.com/arthurdrewslegendstpeter.htm |title=Arthur Drews – The Legend of St. Peter |publisher=Egodeath.com |date=2005-10-10 |accessdate=2010-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[George Albert Wells]], "St. Peter as Bishop of Rome"&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Columbia Encyclopedia|Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia]]'' (2013).&lt;/ref&gt; also rendered as '''Sunzi'''; {{lang-zh|t=孫子}}) was a Chinese general, [[military strategist]], writer, and philosopher who lived in the [[Eastern Zhou period]] of ancient China. Sun Tzu is traditionally credited as the author of ''[[The Art of War]]'', a widely influential work of [[military strategy]] that has affected both Western and East Asian philosophy and military thinking. Aside from his legacy as the author of ''The Art of War'', Sun Tzu is revered in [[Chinese culture|Chinese]] and [[Culture of East Asia|East Asia]]n culture as a legendary historical and military figure. His birth name was '''Sun Wu''', and he was known outside of his family by his [[courtesy name]] '''Changqing'''. The name ''Sun Tzu'' by which he is best known in the Western World is an [[Chinese honorifics|honorific]] which means "Master [[Sun (surname)|Sun]]".

Sun Tzu's historicity is uncertain. The Han dynasty historian [[Sima Qian]] and other traditional Chinese historians placed him as a minister to [[King Helü of Wu|King Helü]] of [[state of Wu|Wu]] and dated his lifetime to 544–496 BC. Modern scholars accepting his historicity nonetheless place the existing text of ''The Art of War'' in the later [[Warring States period]] based upon its style of composition and its descriptions of warfare.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Sawyer|first=Ralph D.|title=The Seven Military Classics of Ancient China|year=2007|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York|isbn=0-465-00304-4|pages=421–22}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional accounts state that the general's descendant [[Sun Bin]] also wrote a treatise on military tactics, also titled ''[[Sun Bin's Art of War|The Art of War]]''. Since both Sun Wu and Sun Bin were referred to as Sun Tzu in classical Chinese texts, some historians believed them identical prior to the rediscovery of Sun Bin's treatise in 1972.

Sun Tzu's work has been praised and employed throughout East Asian warfare since its composition. During the twentieth century, ''The Art of War'' grew in popularity and saw practical use in [[Western world|Western society]] as well. It continues to influence many competitive endeavors throughout the world, including culture, politics,&lt;ref name=wp&gt;{{citation|last=Scott|first=Wilson|title=Obama meets privately with Jewish leaders|date=7 March 2013|url=https://articles.washingtonpost.com/2013-03-07/politics/37535039_1_nuclear-weapons-jewish-leaders-president-obama|newspaper=The Washington Post|publication-place=Washington, D.C.|accessdate=22 May 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130724060741/http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2013-03-07/politics/37535039_1_nuclear-weapons-jewish-leaders-president-obama|archivedate=24 July 2013|df=}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=UPI&gt;{{citation|title=Obama to challenge Israelis on peace|work=United Press International|date=8 March 2013|url=http://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2013/03/08/Obama-to-challenge-Israelis-on-peace/UPI-70151362729600/|accessdate=22 May 2013}}.&lt;/ref&gt; business,&lt;ref name=Business&gt;{{citation|last=Garner|first=Rochelle|title=Oracle's Ellison Uses 'Art of War' in Software Battle With SAP|work=Bloomberg|date=16 October 2006|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=aFA0SRsqGq04|accessdate=18 May 2013}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and sports,&lt;ref name=Football&gt;{{citation|last=Hack|first=Damon|title=For Patriots' Coach, War Is Decided Before Game|newspaper=The New York Times|date=3 February 2005|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/03/sports/football/03belichick.html?_r=0|accessdate = 18 May 2013}}.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as modern warfare.

==Life==
[[File:Inscribed bamboo-slips of Art of War.jpg|thumb|The [[Yinqueshan Han Slips]] unearthed in 1972 include Sun Tzu's ''Art of War'', collection of [[Shandong Museum]]]]
The oldest available sources disagree as to where Sun Tzu was born. The ''[[Spring and Autumn Annals]]'' states that Sun Tzu was born in [[Qi (state)|Qi]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sawyer|2007|p=151}}.&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Sima Qian]]'s later ''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]'' (''Shiji'') states that Sun Tzu was a native of [[Wu (state)|Wu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sawyer|2007|p=153}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Both sources agree that Sun Tzu was born in the late [[Spring and Autumn period]] and that he was active as a general and strategist, serving [[kings of Wu|king]] [[King Helü|Helü]] of [[Wu (state)|Wu]] in the late sixth century BC, beginning around 512 BC. Sun Tzu's victories then inspired him to write ''The Art of War''. ''The Art of War'' was one of the most widely read military treatises in the subsequent [[Warring States period]], a time of constant war among seven ancient Chinese states {{ndash}} [[Zhao (state)|Zhao]], Qi, [[Qin (state)|Qin]], [[Chu (state)|Chu]], [[Han (state)|Han]], [[Wei (state)|Wei]], and [[Yan (state)|Yan]] {{ndash}} who fought to control the vast expanse of fertile territory in Eastern China.&lt;ref name=mcneilly3&gt;{{harvnb|McNeilly|2001|pp=3–4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the more well-known stories about Sun Tzu, taken from Sima Qian, illustrates Sun Tzu's temperament as follows: Before hiring Sun Tzu, the King of Wu tested Sun Tzu's skills by commanding him to train a [[harem]] of 360 [[Concubinage|concubines]] into soldiers. Sun Tzu divided them into two companies, appointing the two concubines most favored by the king as the company commanders. When Sun Tzu first ordered the concubines to face right, they giggled. In response, Sun Tzu said that the general, in this case himself, was responsible for ensuring that soldiers understood the commands given to them. Then, he reiterated the command, and again the concubines giggled. Sun Tzu then ordered the execution of the king's two favored concubines, to the king's protests. He explained that if the general's soldiers understood their commands but did not obey, it was the fault of the officers. Sun Tzu also said that, once a general was appointed, it was his duty to carry out his mission, even if the king protested. After both concubines were killed, new officers were chosen to replace them. Afterwards, both companies, now well aware of the costs of further frivolity, performed their maneuvers flawlessly.&lt;ref name=bradford134&gt;{{harvnb|Bradford|2000|pp=134–35}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sima Qian claimed that Sun Tzu later proved on the battlefield that his theories were effective (for example, at the [[Battle of Boju]]), that he had a successful military career, and that he wrote ''The Art of War'' based on his tested expertise.&lt;ref name=bradford134/&gt; However, the ''[[Zuo zhuan]]'', a historical text written centuries earlier than the ''Shiji'', provides a much more detailed account of the Battle of Boju, but does not mention Sun Tzu at all.&lt;ref name="zuozhuan"&gt;{{citation|chapterurl=http://www2.iath.virginia.edu/saxon/servlet/SaxonServlet?source=xwomen/texts/chunqiu.xml&amp;style=xwomen/xsl/dynaxml.xsl&amp;chunk.id=d2.17&amp;toc.depth=1&amp;toc.id=0&amp;doc.lang=bilingual|chapter=Duke Ding|volume=XI|title=[[Zuo Zhuan]]|author=[[Zuo Qiuming]]|language=Chinese, English|accessdate=30 November 2011}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historicity===
Beginning around the 12th century, some scholars began to doubt the historical existence of Sun Tzu, primarily on the grounds that he is not mentioned in the historical classic ''Zuo zhuan'', which mentions most of the notable figures from the Spring and Autumn period.{{sfnp|Gawlikowski|Loewe|1993|p=447}}  The name "Sun Wu" ({{lang|zh-hant|孫武}}) does not appear in any text prior to the ''Shiji'',{{sfnp|Mair|2007|p=9}} and may have been a made-up descriptive cognomen meaning "the fugitive warrior": the surname "Sun" can be glossed as the related term "fugitive" (''xùn'' {{lang|zh-hant|遜}}), while "Wu" is the ancient Chinese virtue of "martial, valiant" (''wǔ'' {{lang|zh-hant|武}}), which corresponds to Sun Tzu's role as the hero's ''[[doppelgänger]]'' in the story of [[Wu Zixu]].&lt;ref name="Victor H 2007 pp. 9-10"&gt;[[Victor H. Mair|Mair, Victor H.]] (2007). ''The Art of War: Sun Zi's Military Methods''. New York: Columbia University Press. pp. 9–10. {{ISBN|978-0-231-13382-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The only historical battle attributed to Sun Tzu, the [[Battle of Boju]], has no record of him fighting in that battle.&lt;ref name="Daryl"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newhistorian.com/the-art-of-war/3232/|title=The Art of War|publisher=''New Historian''|author=Worthington, Daryl}} March 13, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Battle of Boju.png|thumb|400px|Situation during the [[Battle of Boju]]]]

Skeptics cite possible historical inaccuracies and anachronisms in the text, and that the book was actually a compilation from different authors and military strategists. Attribution of the authorship of ''The Art of War'' varies among scholars and has included people and movements including Sun; [[state of Chu|Chu]] scholar [[Wu Zixu]]; an anonymous author; a school of theorists in [[state of Qi|Qi]] or [[state of Wu|Wu]]; [[Sun Bin]]; and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sawyer|2005|pp=34–35}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Sun Bin appears to have been an actual person who was a genuine authority on military matters, and may have been the inspiration for the creation of the historical figure "Sun Tzu" through a form of [[euhemerism]].&lt;ref name="Victor H 2007 pp. 9-10"/&gt; The name Sun Wu does appear in later sources such as the ''Shiji'' and the ''[[Wu Yue Chunqiu]]'', but were written centuries after Sun Tzu's era.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sawyer|2007|pp=176–77}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of the strips in other works however, such as ''[[The Methods of the Sima]]'' is considered proof of Sun Tzu's historical priority.&lt;ref name=sawyer149&gt;{{harvnb|Sawyer|1994|pp=149–50}}.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Ralph Sawyer, it is very likely Sun Tzu did exist and not only served as a general but also wrote the core of the book that bears his name.&lt;ref name="sawyer"/&gt; It is argued that there is a disparity between the large-scale wars and sophisticated techniques detailed in the text and the more primitive small-scale battles that many believe predominated in China during the 6th century BC. Against this, Sawyer argues that the teachings of Sun Wu were probably taught to succeeding generations in his family or a small school of disciples, which eventually included Sun Bin. These descendants or students may have revised or expanded upon certain points in the original text.&lt;ref name="sawyer"&gt;{{harvnb|Sawyer|2007|pp=150–51}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Skeptics who identify issues with the traditionalist view point to possible anachronisms in ''The Art of War'' including terms, technology (such as anachronistic [[crossbows]] and the unmentioned [[cavalry]]), philosophical ideas, events, and military techniques that should not have been available to Sun Wu.&lt;ref&gt;Yang, Sang. ''The Art of War''. Wordsworth Editions Ltd (December 5, 1999). pp. 14–15. {{ISBN|978-1853267796}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Asian History"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://asianhistory.about.com/od/ancientchina/p/Sun-Tzu-Art-of-War.htm|title=Sun Tzu and the Art of War|publisher=''Asian History''|author=Szczepanski, Kallie}} February 04, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, there are no records of professional generals during the [[Spring and Autumn period]]; these are only extant from the [[Warring States period]], so there is doubt as to Sun Tzu's rank and generalship.&lt;ref name="Asian History"/&gt; This caused much confusion as to when ''The Art of War'' was actually written. The first traditional view is that it was written in 512 BC by the historical Sun Wu, active in the last years of the Spring and Autumn period (c. 722–481 BC). A second view, held by scholars such as Samuel Griffith, places ''The Art of War'' during the middle to late Warring States period (c. 481–221 BC). Finally, a third school claims that the slips were published in the last half of the 5th century BC; this is based on how its adherents interpret the bamboo slips discovered at [[Yinqueshan Han Slips|Yinque Shan]] in 1972 AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.classicsofstrategy.com/2015/11/sun-tzu-the-art-of-war-c-500-300-bc.html|title=Sun Tzu, The Art of War (c. 500–300 B.C.)|publisher=''Classics of Strategy''|author=Morrow, Nicholas|date=February 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''The Art of War''==
{{Main|The Art of War}}
[[File:Bamboo book - binding - UCR.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A copy of ''The Art of War'' written on bamboo|alt=A bamboo book]]
''[[The Art of War]]'' is traditionally ascribed to Sun Tzu. It presents a [[philosophy of war]] for managing conflicts and winning battles. It is accepted as a [[masterpiece]] on strategy and has been frequently cited and referred to by generals and theorists since it was first published, translated, and distributed internationally.&lt;ref name="McNeilly1"&gt;{{harvnb|McNeilly|2001|p=5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are numerous theories concerning when the text was completed and concerning the identity of the author or authors, but archeological recoveries show ''The Art of War'' had taken roughly its current form by at least the early [[Han dynasty|Han]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sawyer|2007|p=423}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Because it is impossible to prove definitively when the ''Art of War'' was completed before this date, the differing theories concerning the work's author or authors and date of completion are unlikely to be completely resolved.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sawyer|2007|p=150}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Some modern scholars believe that it contains not only the thoughts of its original author but also commentary and clarifications from later military theorists, such as [[Li Quan (general)|Li Quan]] and [[Du Mu]].

Of the military texts written before the [[Qin's wars of unification|unification of China]] and [[Shi Huangdi]]'s subsequent [[Burning of books and burying of scholars|book burning]] in the second century BC, six major works have survived. During the much later [[Song dynasty]], these six works were combined with a [[Tang dynasty|Tang]] text into a collection called the ''[[Seven Military Classics]]''. As a central part of that compilation, ''The Art of War'' formed the foundations of orthodox military theory in early modern China. Illustrating this point, the book was required reading to pass the tests for imperial appointment to military positions.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sawyer|1994|pp=13–14}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sun Tzu's The ''Art of War'' uses language that may be unusual in a Western text on warfare and strategy.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Simpkins|Simpkins|1999|pp=131–33}}.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the eleventh chapter states that a leader must be "serene and inscrutable" and capable of comprehending "unfathomable plans". The text contains many similar remarks that have long confused Western readers lacking an awareness of the [[East Asian religions|East Asian context]]. The meanings of such statements are clearer when interpreted in the context of [[Taoism|Taoist]] thought and practice. Sun Tzu viewed the ideal general as an [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightened]] Taoist master, which has led to ''The Art of War'' being considered a prime example of Taoist strategy.

The book has also become popular among political leaders and those in [[business management]]. Despite its title, ''The Art of War'' addresses strategy in a broad fashion, touching upon [[public administration]] and planning. The text outlines theories of battle, but also advocates [[diplomacy]] and the cultivation of relationships with other nations as essential to the health of a state.&lt;ref name="McNeilly1"/&gt;

On April 10, 1972, the [[Yinqueshan Han Tombs]] were accidentally unearthed by construction workers in [[Shandong]].&lt;ref name=shandong&gt;{{citation|title=Yinqueshan Han Bamboo Slips|url=http://www.sdwenbo.com/art.asp?id=26&amp;type=6|date=24 April 2008|publisher=[[Shandong Provincial Museum]]|language=Chinese|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029195157/http://www.sdwenbo.com/art.asp?id=26&amp;type=6|archivedate=29 October 2013|df=}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Clements"&gt;{{citation|last=Clements|first=Jonathan|title=The Art of War: A New Translation|date=21 June 2012|publisher=Constable &amp; Robinson Ltd|isbn=978-1-78033-131-7|pages=77–78}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars uncovered a [[Yinqueshan Han Slips|collection of ancient texts]] written on unusually well-preserved [[bamboo slips]]. Among them were ''The Art of War'' and [[Sun Bin]]'s ''Military Methods''.&lt;ref name="Clements"/&gt; Although Han dynasty bibliographies noted the latter publication as extant and written by a descendant of Sun, it had previously been lost. The rediscovery of Sun Bin's work is regarded as extremely important by scholars, both because of Sun Bin's relationship to Sun Tzu and because of the work's addition to the body of military thought in Chinese late antiquity.&lt;ref&gt;朱文章(Sydney Wen-Jang Chu) ； 李承禹(Cheng-Yu Lee) ''Just another Masterpiece: the Differences between Sun Tzu's the Art of War and Sun Bin's the Art of War''. http://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/alDetailedMesh?docid=P20121108003-201301-201302010022-201302010022-59-73&lt;/ref&gt; The discovery as a whole significantly expanded the body of surviving [[Warring States]] military theory. Sun Bin's treatise is the only known military text surviving from the Warring States period discovered in the twentieth century and bears the closest similarity to ''The Art of War'' of all surviving texts.

==Legacy==
Sun Tzu's ''Art of War'' has influenced many notable figures. The Chinese historian [[Sima Qian]] recounted that China's first historical [[emperor of China|emperor]], [[state of Qin|Qin]]'s [[Shi Huangdi]], considered the book invaluable in ending the time of the [[Warring States]]. In the 20th century, the [[Chinese Communist]] leader [[Mao Zedong]] partially credited his 1949 victory over [[Chiang Kai-shek]] and the [[Kuomintang]] to ''The Art of War''. The work strongly influenced Mao's [[Little Red Book|writings about guerrilla warfare]], which further influenced communist insurgencies around the world.&lt;ref name="McNeilly2"/&gt;

''The Art of War'' was introduced into Japan {{circa|lk=no|AD 760}} and the book quickly became popular among Japanese generals. Through its later influence on [[Oda Nobunaga]], [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]], and [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]],&lt;ref name="McNeilly2"&gt;{{harvnb|McNeilly|2001|pp=6–7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; it significantly affected the [[Edo period|unification of Japan]] in the early modern era. Before the [[Meiji Restoration]], mastery of its teachings was honored among the [[samurai]] and its teachings were both exhorted and exemplified by influential ''[[daimyō]]s'' and ''[[shōgun]]s''. It remained popular among the [[Imperial Japanese Army|Imperial Japanese armed forces]]. The [[Admiral of the Fleet]] [[Tōgō Heihachirō]], who led Japan's forces to victory in the [[Russo-Japanese War]], was an avid reader of Sun Tzu.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tung|2001|p=805}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ho Chi Minh]] translated the work for his Vietnamese officers to study. His general [[Võ Nguyên Giáp]], the strategist behind victories over [[Franco-Vietnamese War|French]] and [[Vietnam War|American]] forces in [[Vietnam]], was likewise an avid student and practitioner of Sun Tzu's ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.sonshi.com/duiker.html|title=Interview with Dr. William Duiker|work=Sonshi.com|accessdate=5 February 2011}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0PBZ/is_3_83/ai_109268913/?tag=untagged |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120629011131/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0PBZ/is_3_83/ai_109268913/?tag=untagged |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-06-29 |title=Learning from Sun Tzu |newspaper=Military Review |date=May–June 2003 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last1=Forbes|first1=Andrew|last2=Henley|first2=David|last-author-amp=yes|year=2012|title=The Illustrated Art of War: Sun Tzu|publisher=Cognoscenti Books|location=Chiang Mai|asin=B00B91XX8U}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

America's Asian conflicts against [[Imperial Japan|Japan]], [[North Korea]], and [[North Vietnam]] brought Sun Tzu to the attention of American military leaders. The [[Department of the Army]] in the United States, through its [[Command and General Staff College]], has directed all units to maintain libraries within their respective headquarters for the continuing education of personnel in the art of war. ''The Art of War'' is mentioned as an example of works to be maintained at each facility, and staff duty officers are obliged to prepare short papers for presentation to other officers on their readings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|author=U.S. Army|year=c. 1985|title=Military History and Professional Development|publisher=Combat Studies Institute|location=U.S. Army Command and General Staff College, Fort Leavenworth, Kansas|id=85-CSI-21 85}}. ''The Art of War'' is mentioned for each unit's acquisition in "Military History Libraries for Duty Personnel" on page 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Sun Tzu's ''Art of War'' is listed on the [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] Professional Reading Program.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.marines.mil/news/messages/Pages/2005/MARINE%20CORPS%20PROFESSIONAL%20READING%20PROGRAM.aspx|title=Marine Corps Professional Reading Program|work=U.S. Marine Corps}}.&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Gulf War]] in the 1990s, both Generals [[Norman Schwarzkopf Jr.]] and [[Colin Powell]] employed principles from Sun Tzu related to deception, speed, and striking one's enemy's weak points.&lt;ref name="McNeilly2"/&gt; However, the United States and other Western countries have been criticised for not truly understanding Sun Tzu's work and not appreciating ''The Art of War'' within the wider context of Chinese society.&lt;ref name=Hall&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hall|first1=Gavin|title=Review – Deciphering The Art of War|url=http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/lsereviewofbooks/2015/01/10/book-review-deciphering-sun-tzu-how-to-read-the-art-of-war/|website=LSE Review of Books|accessdate=23 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Daoist]] rhetoric is a component incorporated in the ''Art of War''. According to Steven C. Combs in "Sun-zi and the ''Art of War'': The Rhetoric of Parsimony",&lt;ref name="Combs 276–294"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Combs|first=Steven C.|title=Sun-zi and the Art of War: The Rhetoric of Parsimony|journal=Quarterly Journal of Speech|date=August 2000|volume=3|issue=3|pages=276–94|doi=10.1080/00335630009384297}}&lt;/ref&gt;  warfare is "used as a metaphor for rhetoric, and that both are philosophically based arts."&lt;ref name="Combs 276–294"/&gt;  Combs writes "Warfare is analogous to persuasion, as a battle for hearts and minds."&lt;ref name="Combs 276–294"/&gt; The application of ''The Art of War'' strategies throughout history is attributed to its philosophical rhetoric. Daoism is the central principle in the ''Art of War''. Combs compares ancient Daoist Chinese to traditional Aristotelian rhetoric, notably for the differences in persuasion. Daoist rhetoric in the art of war warfare strategies is described as "peaceful and passive, favoring silence over speech".&lt;ref name="Combs 276–294"/&gt; This form of communication is [[parsimonious]]. Parsimonious behavior, which is highly emphasized in ''The Art of War'' as avoiding confrontation and being spiritual in nature, shapes basic principles in Daoism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Galvany|first=Albert|title=Philosophy, Biography, and Anecdote: On the Portrait of Sun Wu|journal=Philosophy East and West|date=October 2011|volume=61|issue=4|pages=630–46|doi=10.1353/pew.2011.0059}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mark McNeilly writes in ''[[Sun Tzu and the Art of Modern Warfare]]'' that a modern interpretation of Sun and his importance throughout Chinese history is critical in understanding China's push to becoming a superpower in the twenty-first century. Modern Chinese scholars explicitly rely on historical strategic lessons and ''The Art of War'' in developing their theories, seeing a direct relationship between their modern struggles and those of China in Sun Tzu's time. There is a great perceived value in Sun Tzu's teachings and other traditional Chinese writers, which are used regularly in developing the strategies of the Chinese state and its leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McNeilly|2001|p=7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, the Chinese television producer [[Zhang Jizhong]] adapted Sun Tzu's life story into a 40-episode historical drama television series entitled ''[[Bing Sheng]]'', starring Zhu Yawen as Sun Tzu.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://data.ent.sina.com.cn/tv/7129.html|title=Bing Sheng|publisher=sina.com|language=Chinese}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Tracy Wilson was born on September 25, 1961 in [[Lachine, Quebec]], Canada.&lt;ref name=COC-bio/&gt;&lt;ref name=SR-bio/&gt; She grew up in [[Port Moody]], [[British Columbia]].&lt;ref name=people920224/&gt;&lt;ref name=BCSSA-HoF/&gt; As child she did swimming and diving, competing at provincials three times. She first swam with the [[Coquitlam]] Sharks in 1967 before moving, in 1970, to Port Moody Aquarians.&lt;ref name=BCSSA-HoF/&gt; She attended college for one semester before her partnership with [[Robert McCall (figure skater)|Rob McCall]] began.&lt;ref name=people920224/&gt;

In 1987, Wilson married Brad Kinsella.&lt;ref name=OSHoF/&gt;&lt;ref name=LH901027/&gt; Though she did not change her name at the time,&lt;ref name=LH901027/&gt; her name is sometimes printed as Tracy Wilson-Kinsella&lt;ref name=SR-bio/&gt;&lt;ref name=COC-HoF/&gt; or Tracy Wilson Kinsella.&lt;ref name=BCSSA-HoF/&gt;&lt;ref name=BVG/&gt; Together they have three kids – two sons who play hockey and a daughter who competes in equestrianism.&lt;ref name=BCSSA-HoF/&gt;&lt;ref name=OSHoF/&gt; They live in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]].&lt;ref name=NBC-bio/&gt;

==Skating career==
Wilson started skating when she was six years old in [[Coquitlam]]. After moving she became a member of Port Moody's [[Inlet Skating Club]].&lt;ref name=BCSSA-HoF/&gt;&lt;ref name=BCSHoF/&gt; She competed in ice dancing for the first time when she was fifteen.&lt;ref name=BCSHoF/&gt; On the junior level, Wilson competed with [[Mark Stokes]]. They were the 1980 Canadian junior national champions.&lt;ref name=SR-bio/&gt;

In the summer of 1981, Wilson teamed up with [[Robert McCall (figure skater)|Rob McCall]].&lt;ref name=SC-HoF/&gt; Their partnership started at the [[Elgin Barrow Arena]] in [[Richmond Hill, Ontario]] and they trained in Richmond Hill throughout their competitive careers.&lt;ref name=RHHoF/&gt; Together they won the [[Canadian Figure Skating Championships|Canadian national championship]] seven times, from 1982–1988. They won the [[Skate Canada International]] competition in 1983 and 1987. The 1983 gold was the first time a Canadian team won the event.&lt;ref name=BCSHoF/&gt; The pair were three-time [[World Figure Skating Championships|World]] bronze medalists (1986-1988). They competed at the [[Figure skating at the 1984 Winter Olympics|1984 Winter Olympic]] and the [[Figure skating at the 1988 Winter Olympics|1988 Winter Olympic]], winning a bronze medal in the 1988 Games. That medal was Canada's first Olympic medal in ice dancing.&lt;ref name=SC-HoF/&gt;&lt;ref name=BCSHoF/&gt;&lt;ref name=SC-ResultBook/&gt;

After the [[1988 World Figure Skating Championships|1988 Worlds]], they decided to [[Amateur sports#Figure skating|go pro]].&lt;ref name=CBC120420/&gt; They competed in professional competition, including winning the [[World Professional Figure Skating Championships|World Professional Championships]] in 1989.&lt;ref name=RHHoF/&gt;&lt;ref name=GS-pro/&gt; The team also performed with [[Stars on Ice]] for two years&lt;ref name=SR-bio/&gt; and other shows. In March/April 1990,&lt;!--people920224 says March, BS921121 says April--&gt; McCall was diagnosed with [[AIDS]] and his health was deteriorating.&lt;ref name=people920224/&gt;&lt;ref name=BS921121/&gt; Disregarding the mass public fear of AIDS at the time, Wilson continued to skate with McCall. The pair did some shows and skated at the 1990 World Professional Championships. Wilson had to stop skating with the birth of her first child in 1991. Soon after McCall deteriorated further and he died November 15, 1991.&lt;ref name=BS921121/&gt; Wilson retired from ice dancing,&lt;ref name=SR-bio/&gt; but she did skate a solo, while pregnant with her second child, at the tribute show for McCall on November 21, 1992.&lt;ref name=BS921121/&gt;

'''Evgeniy Aleksandrovich Zhovtis''' Евгений Александрович Жовтис (born 17 August 1955) is a [[Kazakhstan human rights]] activist and director of the Kazakhstan International Bureau for Human Rights and Rule of Law.

After graduating as a mining engineer, he became vice president of the Independent Trade Union of Kazakhstan and represented the interests of miners, who worked under often inhumane conditions. He also became a member of the executive board of the [[Civic Organisation Memorial]], working for public awareness of human rights and democratic values under the repressive conditions in the [[USSR]].

After the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] and independence for Kazakhstan in 1991, Zhovtis continued working for human rights and qualified as a lawyer to help that work. In 1992, with the support of the [[Union of Councils for Jews in the Former Soviet Union]], he founded the Kazakhstan American Bureau on Human Rights and Rule of Law. This later became an independent organisation under its present name.

==Personal life==

Zhovtis is married, with a daughter and a son.

===Conviction===
While driving near [[Almaty]] in late July 2009, the car Zhovtis was driving accidentally hit and killed a pedestrian. On 3 September 2009 Zhovtis was found guilty and sentenced to four years' imprisonment on charges of manslaughter. Local and international human rights activists say the trial was flawed and used by the authorities as a convenient way to imprison him.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hrw.org/en/news/2009/09/03/kazakhstan-review-rights-defender-s-harsh-sentence Human Rights Watch call for his 2009 sentence to be reviewed retrieved 4th Feb 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/robert-amsterdam/kazakhstans-human-rights_b_276759.html | work=Huffington Post | first=Robert | last=Amsterdam | title=Kazakhstan's Human Rights Drop Through the Floor | date=3 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/05/world/asia/05kazakh.html|title=Sentence for Kazakh Activist in Accident Draws Outcry|author=Michael Schwirtz|date=4 September 2009|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=12 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; After two and a half years in prison, Zhovtis was granted amnesty on 17 February 2012.&lt;ref name="ifex"&gt;{{cite news | title = ALERT: Editor Igor Vinyavsky released | date = 23 March 2012 | url = http://www.ifex.org/kazakhstan/2012/03/23/vinyavsky_released/ | work = [[International Freedom of Expression Exchange]] | accessdate = 2012-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
