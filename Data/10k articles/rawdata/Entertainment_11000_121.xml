'''''3: The Dale Earnhardt Story''''' is a 2004 [[television movie]] produced by [[ESPN]] depicting the life of [[NASCAR]] driver [[Dale Earnhardt]]. It chronicles his life from his humble upbringing in [[Kannapolis, North Carolina]], throughout his career racing automobiles to include his rise to dominance in NASCAR, culminating with his [[Death of Dale Earnhardt|death]] in the final lap of the [[2001 Daytona 500]].&lt;ref&gt;Heffernan, Virginia. (December 10, 2004). &lt;span class="plainlinks"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/10/arts/television/a-first-love-becomes-the-family-business.html A First Love Becomes the Family Business]&lt;/span&gt;. nytimes.com. Retrieved November 16, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Its central theme focuses on the relationship between him and his father, [[Ralph Earnhardt]], as well as the relationship between him and his youngest son, [[Dale Earnhardt, Jr.]] It was first broadcast on December 11, 2004, and subsequently released on DVD. [[Barry Pepper]] was cast in the lead role to star as Earnhardt; giving a credible performance which earned him a nomination for a [[Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Miniseries or Television Movie]].&lt;ref&gt;&lt;span class="plainlinks"&gt;[http://www.sagawards.org/awards/nominees-and-recipients/11th-annual-screen-actors-guild-awards The 11th Annual Screen Actors Guild Awards]&lt;/span&gt;. sagawards.org. Retrieved November 16, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the film's race scenes were filmed at [[Rockingham Speedway]]. The track had lost its races and at the time was used mostly as a test facility and driving school. [[Chad McCumbee]], who portrayed Earnhardt Jr., later became a [[NASCAR]] driver in the [[Camping World Truck Series|Truck Series]].&lt;ref&gt;&lt;span class="plainlinks"&gt;[http://www.racing-reference.info/driver/Chad_McCumbee Chad McCumbee]&lt;/span&gt;. racing-reference.info. Retrieved November 16, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; He also raced alongside [[Dale Earnhardt Jr.|Dale Jr.]] himself at the [[Pocono 500]], driving [[Kyle Petty]]'s 45 car, as Petty was in the [[NASCAR on TNT|TNT]] broadcast booth.

Actors playing the part of the Flying Aces were Ray Everett, Greg Davis, David Brooks, Robbie Hicks, and Don Gyr.

==Copyright infringement controversy==
The script of this film was not approved by Earnhardt's widow, [[Teresa Earnhardt]], and his family.  The film, although capturing the essence of Earnhardt, is inaccurate in many of the events seen in it.  Richard Childress, the former car owner and team owner of Earnhardt, sued ESPN for copyright infringement with its use of the "3" logo.&lt;ref&gt;Bell, Robert. (March 23, 2005) &lt;span class="plainlinks"&gt;[http://www.greensboro.com/earnhardt-s-spins-its-way-into-courtroom-a-lawsuit-filed/article_f6f402c9-1524-5b03-aa32-80098905a4e7.html EARNHARDT'S '3' SPINS ITS WAY INTO COURTROOM A LAWSUIT FILED IN FEDERAL COURT IN GREENSBORO CHARGES ESPN WITH COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT]&lt;/span&gt;. greensboro.com. Retrieved November 16, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historical inaccuracies ==
The relationship between [[Darrell Waltrip]] and Earnhardt in the film focuses primarily on their fierce rivalry, with little attention given to the friendship that would develop between the two. Waltrip noted this on his website during the runup to the film. Waltrip eventually drove for Earnhardt's race team in 1998. Also, it is Waltrip's tear-filled voice that can be heard saying "I just hope Dale's okay," during the film's depiction of Earnhardt's fatal crash at Daytona due to the use of [[NASCAR on Fox]]'s original footage and commentary, which is now owned by NASCAR Images (starting in 2001, NASCAR Images owns all NASCAR race footage; they also own the footage of the former Sunbelt Video).

Several cars shown in the film were historically inaccurate. In the moments before the [[2001 Daytona 500]], the cars of [[Bobby Labonte]], [[Rusty Wallace]], [[Bill Elliott]], [[Jeff Gordon]], and [[Rick Mast]] are seen, with Gordon's easily visible, as the 2001 season was the year the "Rainbow Warrior" livery was replaced with the "Fire and Flames" livery. Also notable was a wrong-year scene featuring [[Morgan-McClure Motorsports]], where a late 1990s Kodak Max film livery was used for [[Sterling Marlin]]'s car instead of the Kodak Gold film livery. (The design was based on a box of Kodak film.) Also, the film car was a Pontiac; the real car MMM fielded at the time was a [[Chevrolet Monte Carlo]]. Morgan-McClure Motorsports did, however, field a Pontiac Grand Prix in the 2003 season. Another inaccuracy is the depiction of Wallace's car as a [[Dodge Intrepid]] in the Daytona 500 – [[Penske Racing]] did not switch to Dodge until 2003, and he was driving a [[Ford Taurus]] in 2001. Labonte's No. 18 is shown as a Chevrolet Monte Carlo in the 2001 Daytona 500 scene with the Chevrolet body style used between 2003 and 2005 and his corresponding 2003–2005 paint scheme. He actually drove a Pontiac Grand Prix in 2001 with his paint scheme from that year.

The February 23, 1986, incident at [[Richmond International Raceway]] was inaccurately depicted, where Earnhardt spun out Waltrip with three laps to go. In the film, his now-famous line "I didn't mean to wreck him, I just wanted to rattle his cage a little" was part of the post-race interview. That line, however, was not said at that time. Instead it was said at [[Bristol Motor Speedway|Bristol]] on August 28, 1999, after he spun out [[Terry Labonte]] on the final lap to win the [[1999 Goody's Headache Powder 500|Goody's Headache Powder 500]].

In Earnhardt's first [[Daytona 500]] start, the film shows him driving a Chevrolet Monte Carlo. However, he actually drove a [[Buick]]. Also mentioned in the scene that he finished 4th in the race, He finished 8th in his first Daytona 500 start and thus it is also inaccurate. He finished 4th prior to that once in 1978 at Dover and would not score another top 5 until North Wilkesboro that same year of his first 500 start.

During the scene of him being at a gas station, soon after the short montage of Earnhardt winning the 1980 title, it showed [[John Anderson (NASCAR driver)|John Anderson]] flipping over during the 1981 [[Budweiser Duel|qualifying races at Daytona]], a race that Earnhardt finished 4th at.

The film made no mention of his two-year stint with car owner [[Bud Moore (NASCAR owner)|Bud Moore]] from 1982 to 1983 or his Budweiser Late Model Sportsman races for [[Hendrick Motorsports|All Star Racing]], the predecessor to today's Hendrick Motorsports. In fact, for many years, Xfinty Series cars by [[Hendrick Motorsports]] used No. 15 because Earnhardt drove a Hendrick-Gee car to a Busch Series win at Charlotte in 1983. From 2001 until 2005, the DEI Chevrolet Monte Carlo driven by [[Michael Waltrip]] was numbered No. 15 in honor of Moore.

Earnhardt actually first met his wife, Teresa, when she was about 16, and he knew she was Hal Houston's daughter (also the uncle of former driver [[Tommy Houston]]). Their meeting is inaccurately portrayed in the film.

In the scenes of the 2001 Daytona 500, Earnhardt is seen wearing a helmet with Corvette Racing decals, rather than his helmet that had GM Goodwrench decals. (The Corvette Racing helmet was used in the Rolex 24 at Daytona, with him sharing it with his son Earnhardt, Jr., [[Andy Pilgrim]], and Kelly Collins.

In the 2001 Daytona 500 scene, Earnhardt is seen wearing tinted racing goggles. He actually wore his clear racing goggles in his final race.

None of Earnhardt's crew chiefs were accurately mentioned. He won his first championship with Doug Richert, then won his next four with [[Kirk Shelmerdine]], and his final two with [[Andy Petree]] (later at [[ESPN]] and now at FOX Sports) at the top of the pit box. He won his only [[1998 Daytona 500|Daytona 500]] with [[Larry McReynolds]] (currently with Fox Sports). None were portrayed in the movie accurately.

There are several mistakes in the 1998 Daytona 500 scene. During the final caution, Earnhardt is shown to take 4 tires during his pit stop. He actually took 2 right-side tires on his final pit stop. During the line of pit crew members congratulating him, it was very noticeable that the Winston logo (the series sponsor from 1971 to 2003) covered the NEXTEL letters on the banner, even though issues over tobacco advertising were prevalent. (NASCAR's ten-year deal with Nextel began in 2004, as the movie was being filmed; the deal has since been extended to 2016 by its successor company, Sprint.)  Also in that scene, Earnhardt, Jr. is shown hugging his father in victory lane. He was not at the race, as he had returned home following the [[PowerShares QQQ 300|Napa Auto Parts 300]] support race in which he was involved in a late race crash that resulted him going airborne.

ESPN Original Entertainment executive producer Will Steger was quoted in the Dick Berggren's Speedway Illustrated magazine (December 2004) saying the film was an "unauthorized docudrama...inspired by the true life of Dale Earnhardt." The story, written by Leo Dougherty, noted that Andy Hillenburg, the current owner of Rockingham Speedway, went across the country from Massachusetts to Florida to California collecting race cars for the film. He provided 62 cars that were built into race cars and painted to reflect cars of certain eras in the film. He owned the Bobby Allison car that was in the film. The car was in the Talladega museum and was the car Allison won the Daytona 500 with the year he beat his son, Davey, to the finish line. Ron Bouchard also loaned his 1981 Talladega-winning car to the film. Hillenburg is quoted in the article saying, "...those are the only cars that appear as they really are."

There was no mention of the rivalry he had with [[Jeff Gordon]] in the 1990s. This was a huge part of Earnhardt's last decade, because from the rivalry, a business was started between him and Gordon – a diecast model company that still exists today. It was also reported that Gordon became a close friend to him, and was basically trained by him in how to race, be the face of NASCAR, etc.

In the scene where Kerry and Dale Jr. are testing a car at [[Concord Speedway]], a pickup truck in the background of a shot of Kerry watching Dale Jr. on track has a No. 8 sticker on the rear window in the same style that was used for Dale Jr's cars when he moved into the Winston Cup Series.

===Anachronisms===
During one of the scenes taking place in the 1970s, Earnhardt is shown placing a money clip on the table holding what is clearly a new-style [[United States twenty-dollar bill|$20 bill]].

Realtree was shown as a sponsor during a dirt track race in the 1950s early in the film, but it was not founded until the 1980s.

[[Sunoco]] Gasoline is shown on the fuel tankers in the film, but [[Union 76]] fuel was used in the era. (Sunoco did not sign with NASCAR until the start of the 2004 season. However, it should be noted many short tracks used Sunoco or CAM2 (now part of Sunoco) even in the 1970s.)

In two different scenes in the film, the infield of various tracks were shown with flags of drivers who were not driving at that time were shown, such as [[Tony Stewart]]'s flag at the [[Darlington Raceway|Darlington]] race in 1990, where [[Neil Bonnett]] suffered a violent crash, along with several other cars involved.

'''''A Pale View of Hills''''' ([[1982 in literature|1982]])  is the first [[novel]] by Nobel Prize–winning author [[Kazuo Ishiguro]]. It won the 1982 [[Winifred Holtby Memorial Prize]]. He received a £1000 advance from publishers [[Faber and Faber]] for the novel after a meeting with [[Robert McCrum]], the fiction editor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/feb/19/fiction.kazuoishiguro | publisher=''The Guardian'' | title=Living memories | author=Nicholas Wroe | date=19 February 2005 | accessdate=27 June 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100525015739/http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2005/feb/19/fiction.kazuoishiguro| archivedate= 25 May 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''A Pale View of Hills'' is the story of Etsuko, a middle-aged Japanese woman living alone in England, and opens with discussion between Etsuko and her younger daughter, Niki, about the recent suicide of Etsuko's older daughter, Keiko.

==Plot summary==
During a visit from her daughter, Niki, Etsuko reflects on her own life as a young woman in Japan, and how she left that country to live in England.  As she describes it, she and her Japanese husband, Jiro, had a daughter together, and a few years later Etsuko met a British man and moved with him to England. She took her elder daughter, Keiko, to England to live with her and the new husband. When Etsuko and her new husband have a daughter, Etsuko wants to call her something "modern" and her husband wants an Eastern-sounding name, so they compromise with the name "Niki," which seems to Etsuko to be perfectly British, but sounds to her husband at least slightly Japanese.

In England, Keiko becomes increasingly solitary and antisocial. Etsuko recalls how, as Keiko grew older, she would lock herself in her room and emerge only to pick up the dinner-plate that her mother would leave for her in the kitchen.  This disturbing behavior ends, as the reader already has learned, in Keiko's suicide.  "Your father," Etsuko tells Niki, "was rather idealistic at times...[H]e really believed we could give her a happy life over here... But you see, Niki, I knew all along.  I knew all along she wouldn't be happy over here."&lt;ref&gt;Kazuo Ishiguro, ''A Pale View of Hills'', pp.176&lt;/ref&gt;

Etsuko tells her daughter, Niki, that she had a friend in Japan named Sachiko.  Sachiko had a daughter named Mariko, a girl whom Etsuko's memory paints as exceptionally solitary and antisocial.  Sachiko, Etsuko recalls, had planned to take Mariko to America with an American soldier identified only as "Frank."  Clearly, Sachiko's story bears striking similarities to Etsuko's.

*Keiko &amp;ndash; Etsuko's elder daughter who commits suicide

== Reception ==
The novel was generally well received by critics, many praising the novel's mysterious tone. [[The New York Review of Books]] called it "eery and tenebrous. It is a ghost story but the narrator does not realise that."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nybooks.com/articles/1989/12/07/on-the-high-wire/|title=On the High Wire|last=Annan|first=Gabriele|work=The New York Review of Books|access-date=2018-11-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The New York Times]] said the novel was "infinitely ... mysterious", and the inconsistent tone of the narrator, with the graphic imagery in the book combined to create "the absolute emblem of our genius of destruction".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/05/09/books/in-a-japan-like-limbo.html|title=IN A JAPAN LIKE LIMBO|access-date=2018-11-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="49288">'''Action film''' is a [[film genre]] in which the protagonist or protagonists are thrust into a series of challenges that typically include violence, extended fighting, physical feats, and frantic chases. Action films tend to feature a resourceful [[hero]] struggling against incredible odds, which include life-threatening situations, a villain, or a pursuit which generally concludes in victory for the hero (though a small number of films in this genre ''have'' ended in victory for the villain instead). Advancements in [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] have made it cheaper and easier to create action sequences and other [[visual effect]]s that required the efforts of professional [[stunt]] crews in the past. However, reactions to action films containing significant amounts of CGI have been mixed, as films that use computer animations to create unrealistic, highly unbelievable events are often met with criticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allrovi.com/movies/genre/action-d646 |title=Action Top rated Most Viewed - AllMovie |publisher=Allrovi.com |date= |accessdate=2013-01-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120421143702/http://www.allrovi.com/movies/genre/action-d646 |archivedate=2012-04-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While action has long been a recurring component in films, the "action film" [[genre]] began to develop in the 1970s along with the increase of stunts and [[special effect]]s. Common action scenes in films are generally, but not limited to, car chases, fighting and gunplay or shootouts.

This genre is closely associated with the [[thriller film|thriller]] and [[adventure film|adventure]] genres, and they may also contain elements of [[spy fiction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= FILM COMMENT : Endangered Species : The American action-fantasy epic is in danger of becoming terminally musclebound and knuckle-headed|work= The Los Angeles Times|date=June 27, 1993|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1993-06-27/entertainment/ca-7586_1_action-hero|accessdate=2010-10-27|first=Peter|last=Rainer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Early action films===
Some historians consider ''[[The Great Train Robbery (1903 film)|The Great Train Robbery]]'' (1903) to be the first action film.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=The Great Train Robbery|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the-great-train-robbery1903/|publisher=Rottentomatoes.com|accessdate=14 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://theactionelite.com/2013/11/whats-the-first-action-movie-ever-made/|title=What’s the First Action Movie Ever Made? {{!}} The Action Elite|website=theactionelite.com|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1920s and 1930s, action-based films were often "[[swashbuckler films|swashbuckling]]" [[adventure films]] in which actors, such as [[Douglas Fairbanks]], wielded swords in period pieces or [[Western (genre)|Westerns]].

The 1940s and 1950s saw "action" in a new form through [[War film|war]] and cowboy movies. [[Alfred Hitchcock]] ushered in the spy-adventure genre while also establishing the use of action-oriented "set pieces" like the famous crop-duster scene and the Mount Rushmore finale in ''[[North by Northwest]]'' (1959). The film, along with a war-adventure called ''[[The Guns of Navarone (film)|The Guns of Navarone]]'' (1961), inspired producers [[Albert R. Broccoli]] and [[Harry Saltzman]] to invest in their own spy-adventure, based on the novels of [[Ian Fleming]].

The long-running success of the [[James Bond]] films or series (which dominated the action films of the 1960s) introduced a staple of the modern-day action film: the resourceful hero. Such larger-than-life characters were a veritable "one-man army"; able to dispatch villainous masterminds after cutting through their disposable henchmen in increasingly creative ways. Such heroes are ready with one-liners, puns, and dry quips. The Bond films also used fast [[editing|cutting]], [[Car chase#In film|car chases]], fist fights, a variety of weapons and gadgets, and elaborate action sequences.

Producer-Director [[John Sturges]]' 1963 film ''[[The Great Escape (film)|The Great Escape]]'', featuring Allied [[Prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] attempting to escape a [[Stalag|German POW camp]] during [[World War II]], and featuring future icons of the action genre including [[Steve McQueen]] and [[Charles Bronson]], is an example of an action film prototype.

===1970s===
During the 1970s, gritty detective stories and urban crime dramas began to evolve and fuse themselves with the new "action" style, leading to a string of maverick police officer films, such as ''[[Bullitt]]'' (1968), ''[[The French Connection (film)|The French Connection]]'' (1971) and ''[[The Seven-Ups]]'' (1973).  ''[[Dirty Harry]]'' (1971) essentially lifted its star, [[Clint Eastwood]], out of his cowboy typecasting, and framed him as the archetypal hero of the urban action film. In many countries, restrictions on language, adult content, and violence had loosened up, and these elements became more widespread.

In the 1970s, martial-arts films from [[Hong Kong]] became popular with Western audiences and inspired big budget films such as [[Bruce Lee]]'s ''[[Enter the Dragon]]'' (1973). [[Chuck Norris]] blended martial arts with 'cops and robbers' in films such as ''[[Good Guys Wear Black]]'' (1978) and ''[[A Force of One]]'' (1979).

From [[Japan]], [[Sonny Chiba]] starred in his first [[martial arts]] movie in 1973 called the ''[[Karate Kiba]]''. His breakthrough international hit was ''[[The Street Fighter]] series'' (1974), which established him as the reigning Japanese martial arts actor in international cinema. He also played the role of [[Mas Oyama]] in ''[[Champion of Death]]'', ''[[Karate Bearfighter]],'' and ''[[Karate for Life]]'' (1975–1977). Chiba's action films were not only bounded by martial arts, but also action thriller (''[[Doberman Cop]]'' and ''[[Golgo 13: Assignment Kowloon]]'' - both from 1977), [[jidaigeki]] (''[[Shogun's Samurai]]'' - 1978, ''[[Samurai Reincarnation]]'' - 1981), and science fiction (''[[G.I. Samurai]]'' - 1979).{{Clear}}

===1980s===
In the 1980s, Hollywood produced many big budget action blockbusters with actors such as [[Sylvester Stallone]], [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], [[Lorenzo Lamas]], [[Michael Dudikoff]], [[Charles Bronson]] and [[Bruce Willis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= FILM; Wanted: New Action Stars  |publisher= The New York Times|date=January 10, 1993|url= https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE6D71E39F933A25752C0A965958260|accessdate=2011-01-12|first=Pat H.|last=Broeske}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= New Hunks Move Over, Arnold.

(1982) - Financial Information|work=The Numbers|access-date=2017-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, [[Sylvester Stallone]] starred in ''[[First Blood]]'', the first installment in the [[Rambo (film series)|Rambo film series]] which made the character [[John Rambo]] a pop culture icon.

1984 saw the beginning of the [[Terminator (franchise)|''Terminator'' franchise]] starring [[Linda Hamilton]] and Arnold Schwarzenegger.  This story provides one of the grittiest roles for a woman in action and Hamilton was required to put in extensive effort to develop a strong physique.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.terminatorfiles.com/media/articles/hamilton_006.htm|title=The transformation of Linda Hamilton|website=www.terminatorfiles.com|language=en|access-date=2017-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

1987's [[Lethal Weapon]] starring [[Mel Gibson]], [[Danny Glover]], and [[Darlene Love]] was another significant action film hit of the decade, and another "buddy-cop" genre classic, launching a franchise that spawned 3 sequels.

The 1988 film, ''[[Die Hard]]'', was particularly influential on the development of the action genre. In the film, [[Bruce Willis]] plays a [[New York City|New York]] police detective who inadvertently becomes embroiled in a terrorist take-over of a [[Los Angeles]] office building high-rise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Die Hard|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/die_hard/|publisher=Rotten Tomatoes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of a maverick, resourceful lone hero has always been a common thread from James Bond to John Rambo, but [[John McClane]] in ''Die Hard'' is much more of an 'everyday' person whom circumstance turns into a reluctant hero.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2013/jul/19/die-hard-25th-anniversary-action-film|title=How Die Hard set the stage for 25 years of action films|date=19 July 2013|first=Tom|last=Shone|publisher=Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film set a pattern for a host of imitators, like  ''[[Under Siege]]'' (1992) and [[Sudden Death (1995 film)|''Sudden Death'']], which used the same formula in a different setting.

By the end of the 1980s, the influence of the successful action film could be felt in almost every genre.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.decentfilms.com/reviews/diehard|title=Die Hard (1988) {{!}} Decent Films - SDG Reviews|last=Greydanus|first=Steven D.|website=Decent Films|language=en|access-date=2017-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1990s===
Like the Western genre, spy-movies, as well as urban-action films, were starting to parody themselves, and with the growing revolution in [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] (computer generated imagery), the "real-world" settings began to give way to increasingly fantastic environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=VREESWIJK|first=Simon|title=A History of CGI in Movies|url=http://www.stikkymedia.com/blog/history-cgi-movies|publisher=Stikky Media|access-date=2013-05-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130504184850/http://www.stikkymedia.com/blog/history-cgi-movies|archive-date=2013-05-04|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;   This new era of action films often had budgets unlike any in the history of motion pictures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.filmsite.org/90sintro.html|title=Film History of the 1990s|website=www.filmsite.org|language=en|access-date=2017-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The success of the many Dirty Harry and James Bond sequels had proven that a single successful action film could lead to a continuing action franchise. Thus, the 1980s and 1990s saw a rise in both budgets and the number of sequels a film could generally have.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Robbins |first=Shawn |title=Analysis: Why Action Franchises Really Do 'Die Hard' |url=http://www.boxoffice.com/articles/2013-02-number-crunch-the-fiscal-opportunity-beyond-trilogies |publisher=Box Office: The Business of Movies |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130508062414/http://www.boxoffice.com/articles/2013-02-number-crunch-the-fiscal-opportunity-beyond-trilogies |archivedate=2013-05-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to an increasing number of filmmakers to create new technologies that would allow them to beat the competition and take audiences to new heights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://io9.com/5940385/whats-the-next-technology-that-will-change-the-way-you-watch-movies|title=What's the next technology that will change the way you watch movies?|last=Anders|first=Charlie Jane|work=io9|access-date=2017-09-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The success of [[Tim Burton]]'s ''[[Batman (1989 film)|Batman]]'' (1989) led to a string of financially successful sequels. Within a single decade, they proved the viability of a novel subgenre of action film: the comic-book movie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bowes|first=Danny|title=Big Screen Batman: Batman (1989)|url=http://www.tor.com/blogs/2011/02/big-screen-batman-batman-1989|publisher=Tor.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Action films also became important in the [[direct-to-video]] market. The ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' reported in 1994 that&lt;ref name="alvarez19941230"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1994-12-30/entertainment/9412300287_1_direct-to-video-video-store-r-rated |title=Big Names Look For Bright Lights In Videoland |last=Alvarez |first=Max J. |date=1994-12-30 |work=Chicago Tribune |access-date=2018-07-22 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The direct-to-video action movie is easy to spot on store shelves because it usually has "Dead," "Death," "Future" or "Blood" in its title. The cover of the video box habitually features a rugged man snuggling some sort of semi-automatic weapon amid a backdrop of high-tech destruction.

The plots are virtually interchangeable: Tough cop tracks down brutal serial killer; tough FBI or DEA agent battles South American drug kingpins; tough CIA agent takes on Middle Eastern terrorists; tough cyborg cop squares off with sadistic cyborg villain in the 25th Century. In short, bargain-basement Schwarzenegger.}}

===2000s===
While action films continued to flourish as the medium-budget genre movie,{{example needed|?|date=May 2018}} it also fused with [[Tent-pole (entertainment)|tent-pole pictures]] in other genres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Binder|first=Jack|title=Summer 2012 Studio Tentpole Film Budget List|url=http://www.filmbudget.com/blog/page/3/|publisher=Film Budget Inc.

However, most of the film was structured around action sequences, many of them quite conventional (hand-to-hand, shooting). While the original ''[[Star Wars]]'' featured some of this kind of fighting, there was just as much emphasis on star-ship chases and dogfights in outer space. The newer films featured more lightsaber duels, sometimes more intense and acrobatic than the originals. Some [[Star Wars fan films|fan films]] also have similar duel scenes like those the prequel trilogy. It was action with a science fiction twist. The trend with films such as ''[[The Matrix (franchise)|The Matrix]]'' and ''[[The Dark Knight Trilogy|The Dark Knight]]'' series, is that hand-to-hand fighting and Asian martial-arts techniques are now widely used in science fiction and superhero movies.

Sylvester Stallone's ''[[The Expendables (2010 film)|The Expendables]]'' used nostalgia for a perceived golden age of action films by casting 1980s action stars alongside new actors in the genre such as [[Jason Statham]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Webster|first=Andy|title=Action Star With Savoir-Faire and a Killer Kick|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/20/movies/jason-statham-action-star-with-savoir-faire-and-a-killer-kick.html|newspaper=New York Times|date=January 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[The Fast and the Furious|''The Fast and the Furious'' series]], the action film staple of the car chase is the central plot driver as it had been in ''[[Smokey and the Bandit]]'' films in the 1970s.

===2010s===

The cross-over of action with science fiction and superhero films continues with many [[Marvel Comics]] characters and settings being used for big budget films.

==Hong Kong action cinema==
{{main|Hong Kong action cinema}}
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2013}}

Currently, action films requiring extensive [[Stunt|stunt work]] and [[special effect]]s tend to be expensive. As such, they are regarded as mostly a large-studio genre in [[Hollywood]], although this is not the case in [[Hong Kong action cinema]], where action films are often modern variations of [[martial arts film]]s. Because of their roots and lower budgets, Hong Kong action films typically center on physical acrobatics, [[martial arts]] fight scenes, stylized [[Gun fu|gun-play]], and dangerous stunt work performed by leading [[stunt actor]]s. On the other hand, American action films typically feature big explosions, car chases, [[stunt double]]s and [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] [[special effect]]s.

Hong Kong action cinema was at its peak from the 1970s to 1990s, when its action movies were experimenting with and popularizing various new techniques that would eventually be adopted by Hollywood action movies. This began in the early 1970s with the martial arts movies of [[Bruce Lee]], which led to a wave of [[Bruceploitation]] movies that eventually gave way to the comedy [[kung fu]] films of [[Jackie Chan]] by the end of the decade. During the 1980s, Hong Kong action cinema re-invented itself with various new movies. These included the modern martial arts action movies featuring physical acrobatics and dangerous stunt work of [[Jackie Chan Stunt Team|Jackie Chan and his stunt team]], as well as [[Yuen Biao]] and [[Sammo Hung]]; the [[wire fu]] and [[wuxia]] films of [[Jet Li]], [[Donnie Yen]], [[Yuen Woo-Ping]] and [[Tsui Hark]]; the [[gun fu]], [[heroic bloodshed]] and [[Triad (underground society)|Triad]] films of [[Chow Yun-Fat]], [[Ringo Lam]] and [[John Woo]]; and the [[girls with guns]] films of [[Michelle Yeoh]] and [[Moon Lee]].

==Subgenres==
* '''Action adventure''' - A subgenre of the [[adventure film]] genre as well. Typically, these films take place in exotic locations and frequently involve the hero travelling to several locations around the world. There are a lot of films with this combined genre. Examples include the [[Indiana Jones (franchise)|Indiana Jones]] franchise, and most superhero films are action adventure, too.
* '''Action comedy''' - A subgenre involving action and [[humour]].&lt;ref name="Sarno3-5"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sarno |first1=Gregory G. |title=Lights! Camera!

Action scenes have a more integral role in action comedies.&lt;ref name="Sarno3-5" /&gt; A common strata of action comedy is the [[buddy cop film]], including ''[[48 Hrs.]]'' (1982), ''[[Beverly Hills Cop]]'' (1984), ''[[Lethal Weapon]]'' (1987), ''[[Midnight Run]]'' (1988), ''[[Bad Boys (1995 film)|Bad Boys]]'' (1995), ''[[Rush Hour film|Rush Hour]]'' (1998), ''[[The Rundown]]'' (2003), ''[[Hot Fuzz]]'' (2007), ''[[The Nice Guys]]'' (2016), and the [[Animation|animated]] ''[[Zootopia]]'' (2016).&lt;ref name="Sarno3-5" /&gt;&lt;ref name="amgActionComedy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmovie.com/subgenre/action-comedy-d513|title=Action &gt;&gt; Action Comedy|work=[[Allmovie]]|publisher=Macrovision Inc.|accessdate=February 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another common strata of action comedy is the [[Martial arts film|martial arts]] comedy, which became popular in [[Hong Kong action cinema]] since the 1980s, with [[Jackie Chan]] being the most famous example,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jackie Chan's 9 Principles of Action Comedy|url=http://nofilmschool.com/2014/12/jackie-chans-9-principles-action-comedy|website=No Film School|language=en|date=2 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="stokes"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stokes|first1=Lisa Odham|last2=Hoover|first2=Michael|title=City on Fire: Hong Kong Cinema|date=1999|publisher=[[Verso Books]]|isbn=9781859842034|page=122|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wmAton5zOPYC&amp;pg=PA122|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with [[Sammo Hung]] and [[Stephen Chow]].
* '''Action drama''' - A subgenre involving action and [[Drama (film and television)|drama]]. Examples include ''[[Man on Fire (2004 film)|Man on Fire]], [[Top Gun]], ''[[Lingaa]]'' (2014)&lt;ref&gt;https://www.thehindu.com/features/cinema/cinema-reviews/lingaa-why-cant-a-rajini-movie-be-a-better-movie/article6686290.ece&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Jai Simha]]'' (2016).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ibtimes.co.in/jai-simha-movie-review-rating-by-audience-live-updates-balakrishna-ks-ravi-kumar-nayanthara-756624&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Action horror''' - A subgenre combining the intrusion of an [[evil]] force, event, or [[supernatural]] personage of horror movies with the gunfights and frenetic chases of the action genre. Themes or elements often prevalent in typical action-horror films include [[Graphic violence|gore]], [[demons]], vicious animals, [[vampires]] and, most commonly, [[zombies]]. This category can also take elements from the [[fantasy film|fantasy]] genre. Examples include ''[[Alien (franchise)|Aliens]]'', ''[[Army of Darkness]]'', ''[[Resident Evil (film)|Resident Evil]]'', ''[[Ghost Rider (2007 film)|Ghost Rider]]'',''[[They Live]],''  ''[[Planet Terror]]'', ''[[Predator (film)|Predator]]'', ''[[Undead (film)|Undead]]'', ''[[I Saw the Devil]]'', ''[[Train to Busan]]'', ''[[Doomsday (2008 film)|Doomsday]]'', ''[[Underworld (film series)|Underworld]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmovie.com/movie/underworld-v284680 |title=Underworld (2003) - Trailers, Reviews, Synopsis, Showtimes and Cast |publisher=AllMovie |date=2003-09-19 |accessdate=2013-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Constantine (film)|Constantine]]'', ''[[Swamp Thing (film)|Swamp Thing]]'', ''[[Priest (2011 film)|Priest]]'', ''[[The Crow (1994 film)|The Crow]]'', ''[[Dawn of the Dead (2004 film)|Dawn of the Dead]]'', ''[[Deep Rising]]'', ''[[From Dusk till Dawn]]'', ''[[Blade (film)|Blade]]'', ''[[They Live]]'' ''[[Legion (2010 film)|Legion]]'', and ''[[End of Days (film)|End of Days]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmsite.org/horrorfilms4.html |title=Horror Films |publisher=Filmsite.org |date= |accessdate=2013-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Buddy cop film|Buddy Cop]]''' - A subgenre that became incredibly popular in the 80's with films such as [[48 Hours (movie)|''48 Hours'']], ''[[Lethal Weapon]]'', and ''[[Beverly Hills Cop]]''. They typically involve two mismatched heroes, who are almost always police officers, whose relationship evolves as they advance the plot. This genre saw a minor resurgence in the 2000s with films like [[Rush Hour (1998 film)|''Rush Hour'']], [[Bad Boys (1995 film)|''Bad Boys'']], ''[[The Nice Guys]]'', and ''[[On Probation (2005 film)|On Probation]]''.
* '''[[Disaster film]]''' - Having elements of [[Thriller film|thriller]] and sometimes [[science fiction film]]s, the main conflict of this genre is some sort of natural or artificial [[disaster]], such as [[floods]], [[earthquake]]s, [[hurricane]]s, [[volcano]]es, [[pandemic]]s, etc. Examples include ''[[Independence Day (1996 film)|Independence Day]]'', ''[[Daylight (1996 film)|Daylight]]'', ''[[Earthquake (1974 film)|Earthquake]]'', ''[[Geostorm]]'', ''[[2012 (film)|2012]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmovie.com/work/2012-432410 |title=2012 - Cast, Reviews, Summary, and Awards - AllRovi |publisher=Allmovie.com |date=2009-11-13 |accessdate=2011-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Day After Tomorrow]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmovie.com/work/the-day-after-tomorrow-281154 |title=The Day After Tomorrow - Cast, Reviews, Summary, and Awards - AllRovi |publisher=Allmovie.com |date=2004-05-28 |accessdate=2011-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Poseidon (film)|Poseidon]]'', ''[[The Towering Inferno]]'', ''[[Dante's Peak]]'', ''[[Deep Impact (film)|Deep Impact]]'', ''[[Volcano (1997 film)|Volcano]]'', ''[[The Core (film)|The Core]]'', ''[[Armageddon (1998 film)|Armageddon]]'', ''[[Twister (1996 film)|Twister]]'', and ''[[San Andreas (film)|San Andreas]]''.
* '''[[Martial arts film|Martial arts]]''' - A subgenre of the action film, [[martial arts]] films contain numerous [[hand-to-hand combat]]s between characters.  They are usually the films' primary appeal and entertainment value and are often the method of storytelling, character expression, and development. Martial arts films contain many characters who are martial artists. These roles are often played by actors who are real martial artists. If not, actors usually fervently train in preparation for their roles.  Another method of going around this issue is that the action director may rely more on stylized action or filmmaking tricks. Examples include [[Hong Kong action films]] such as ''[[Police Story (film series)|Police Story]]'', ''[[Kung Fu Hustle]]'', ''[[Fearless (2006 film)|Fearless]]'', ''[[Fist of Legend]]'', ''[[Drunken Master]]'', ''[[Enter the Dragon]]'', ''[[Shanghai Noon]]'', ''[[Iron Monkey (1993 film)|Iron Monkey]]'', ''[[Flash Point (film)|Flash Point]]'', and ''[[Shaolin Soccer]]'', as well as ''[[The Karate Kid (1984 film)|The Karate Kid]]'', ''[[A Force of One]]'', ''[[Ninja Assassin]]'', ''[[Ong-Bak: Muay Thai Warrior|Ong-Bak]]'', ''[[The Octagon (film)|The Octagon]]'', ''[[Kill Bill]]'', ''[[Lone Wolf McQuade]]'', ''[[Mortal Kombat (film)|Mortal Kombat]]'', ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1990 film)|Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]'', ''[[The Raid: Redemption]]'', ''[[Champion of Death]]'', ''[[Karate Bearfighter]]'', ''[[Doberman Cop]]'', ''[[Golgo 13: Assignment Kowloon]]'', ''[[Big Trouble in Little China]]'', ''[[Charlie's Angels (franchise)|Charlie's Angels]]'', and ''[[The Street Fighter]]'' series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmovie.com/movie/street-fighter-v134008 |title=Street Fighter (1994) - Trailers, Reviews, Synopsis, Showtimes and Cast |publisher=AllMovie |date= |accessdate=2013-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; A variant of the genre is [[Wuxia]], a stylized action fantasy period genre typically set in Ancient Asia where skill in the martial arts can enable fantastic abilities like flying and magic like abilities.
* '''Sci-fi action''' - Sharing many of the conventions of a [[science fiction film]], sci-fi action films emphasizes gun-play, space battles, invented weaponry, and other sci-fi elements weaved into action film premises. Examples include ''[[G.I. Samurai]]'', ''[[Terminator 2]]'', ''[[The Matrix]]'', ''[[Total Recall (1990 film)|Total Recall]]'', ''[[Minority Report (film)|Minority Report]]'', ''[[The Island (1980 film)|The Island]]'', ''[[Star Wars]]'', the ''[[Men in Black (film series)|Men in Black franchise]]'', ''[[Aliens (film)|Aliens]]'', ''[[I, Robot (film)|I Robot]]'', ''[[Transformers (2007 film)|Transformers]]'', ''[[The Hunger Games (film)|The Hunger Games]]'', ''[[Equilibrium (film)|Equilibrium]]'', ''[[District 9]]'', ''[[Serenity (2005 film)|Serenity]]'', ''[[Akira (1988 film)|Akira]]'', ''[[Paycheck (film)|Paycheck]]'', ''[[Predator (film)|Predator]]'', ''[[RoboCop]]'', ''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]]'', ''[[Mad Max 2]]'', ''[[Divergent (film)|Divergent]]'', ''[[They Live]]'', ''[[Escape from New York]]'', ''[[Demolition Man (film)|Demolition Man]]'',''[[Virtuosity]]''  and ''[[The Fifth Element]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmovie.com/movie/v154944 |title=The Fifth Element (1997) - Trailers, Reviews, Synopsis, Showtimes and Cast |publisher=AllMovie |date=1997-05-07 |accessdate=2013-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Spy film]]''': In which the hero is generally a government agent who must take violent action against agents of a rival government or (in recent years) terrorists. They often revolve around spies who are involved in investigating various events, often on a global scale. This subgenre deals with the subject of fictional [[espionage]], either in a realistic way (such as the adaptations of [[John Le Carré]]) or as a basis for fantasy (such as [[James Bond]]). It is a significant aspect of [[Cinema of the United Kingdom|British cinema]],&lt;ref&gt;"The Spying Game: British Cinema and the Secret State", 2009 [[Cambridge Film Festival]], pp54-57 of the [http://www.cambridgefilmfestival.org.uk/news/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/CFF09-_brochure_low_res.pdf festival brochure.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720090930/http://www.cambridgefilmfestival.org.uk/news/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/CFF09-_brochure_low_res.pdf |date=2011-07-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with leading British directors, such as [[Alfred Hitchcock]] and [[Carol Reed]], making notable contributions and many films set in the [[Secret Intelligence Service|British Secret Service]]. The subgenre showcases a combination of exciting escapism, heavy action, stylized fights, technological thrills, and exotic locales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/features/spy-movies--the-guys-who-came-in-from-the-cold-1796078.html |title=Geoffrey Macnab, "Spy movies - The guys who came in from the cold"|work=The Independent|date=2009-10-02 |accessdate=2013-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not all spy films fall in the action genre, only those showcasing heavy action such as frequent shootouts and car chases fall in action, spy films with lesser action would be in the thriller genre (see the spy entry in the [[Thriller film|subgenres of thriller film]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmsite.org/thrillerfilms3.html |title=Thriller and Suspense Films |publisher=Filmsite.org |date= |accessdate=2013-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Action films of this subgenre include ''[[Casino Royale (2006 film)|Casino Royale]]'', the ''[[Mission: Impossible (film series)|Mission: Impossible franchise]]'', ''[[Ronin (film)|Ronin]]'', ''[[True Lies]]'', ''[[Salt (2010 film)|Salt]]'', ''[[From Paris with Love (film)|From Paris with Love]]'', ''[[The International (2009 film)|The International]]'', ''[[Patriot Games (film)|Patriot Games]]'', ''[[XXX (2002 film)|xXx]]'', ''[[Colombiana]]'', [[Miss Congeniality (film)|''Miss Congeniality'']], and [[Jason Bourne]] in ''[[Bourne (film series)|The Bourne series]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmovie.com/movie/the-bourne-ultimatum-v331166 |title=The Bourne Ultimatum (2007) - Trailers, Reviews, Synopsis, Showtimes and Cast |publisher=AllMovie |date=2007-08-03 |accessdate=2013-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Action thriller''' - Featuring guns, cool explosions, and amazing set pieces, this movie type first developed in the 1970s in such films as ''[[Dirty Harry]]'' and ''[[The French Connection (film)|The French Connection]],'' and became the exemplar of the Hollywood mega-blockbuster in the 1980s in such works as ''[[Die Hard]]'' and ''[[Lethal Weapon]]''. These films often feature a race against the clock, lots of violence, and a clear—often flamboyantly evil—antagonist. Though they may involve elements of crime or mystery films, those aspects take a back seat to the action. Other significant works include ''[[Hard Boiled]]'', ''[[True Romance]]'', ''[[Point Break (1991 film)|Point Break]]'', ''[[The Warriors (film)|The Warriors]]'', ''[[Bullitt]]'', ''[[The Seven-Ups]]'', ''[[Cobra (1986 film)|Cobra]],'' and ''[[Rambo: First Blood Part II]]'', ''[[Taken (film)|Taken]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmovie.com/subgenre/action-thriller-d509|title=Subgenre - Action Thriller - AllMovie|work=AllMovie}}&lt;/ref&gt; The story takes place in limited location; a single building, plane, or vessel - which is seized or under threat by enemy agents, but are opposed by a single hero who fights an extended battle within the location using stealth and cunning to attempt to defeat them.&lt;ref name="HardStuff"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,299795,00.html |title=The 'Hard' Stuff |last1=Broeske |first1=Pat H. |last2=Wells |first2=Jeffrey |date=December 1, 1995 |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |publisher= |accessdate=July 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Die Hard]]'' subgenre has become popular in Hollywood because of its crowd appeal and the relative simplicity of building sets for such a constrained piece. Examples include ''[[Under Siege]]'' (terrorists take over a ship), ''[[Broken Arrow (1996 film)|Broken Arrow]]'' (terrorists hijack a nuclear weapon from a B-2 bomber), ''[[Snakes on a Plane]]'' (poisonous snakes take over a passenger plane), ''[[Speed (1994 film)|Speed]]'' (terrorist takes over a bus), ''[[Under Siege 2: Dark Territory]]'', and ''[[Derailed (2002 film)|Derailed]]'' (hostages are trapped on trains and buses), ''[[Sudden Death (1995 film)|Sudden Death]]'' (terrorists take over an Ice Hockey stadium), ''[[Passenger 57]]'', ''[[Executive Decision]]'', and ''[[Air Force One (film)|Air Force One]]'' (hostages are trapped on a plane), ''[[Con Air]]'' (criminals take over a transport plane), and ''[[Half Past Dead]]'' and ''[[The Rock (film)|The Rock]]'' (criminals or terrorists take over a prison). ''[[Paul Blart: Mall Cop]]'' is a recent [[Parody|spoof]] of this trend (as ''Die Hard'' in a mall).
* '''[[Superhero film]]''' - Usually having elements of science fiction and fantasy, they focus on the actions of one or more superheroes, who usually possess superhuman abilities and are dedicated to protecting the public. These films are almost always action-oriented and the first film of a particular character often includes a focus on the origin of the special powers, including the first fight against the character's most famous [[supervillain]] [[archenemy]]. Some superheroes are often from [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]] and [[DC Comics|DC]], or they can be made-up. Examples include ''[[Batman Begins]]'', ''[[Iron Man (2008 film)|Iron Man]]'', ''[[Green Lantern (film)|Green Lantern]]'', ''[[Spider-Man (2002 film)|Spider-Man]]'', ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'', ''[[X-Men (film series)|X-Men]]'', ''[[Thor (film)|Thor]]'', ''[[Captain America: The First Avenger]]'', ''[[Daredevil (film)|Daredevil]]'', ''[[Hulk (film)|Hulk]]'', ''[[Wonder Woman (2017 film)|Wonder Woman]]'', ''[[Kick-Ass (film)|Kick-Ass]]'', ''[[Superman Returns]]'', and '' [[Justice League (film)|Justice League]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmovie.com/movie/v66900 |title=Superman: The Movie (1978) - Trailers, Reviews, Synopsis, Showtimes and Cast |publisher=AllMovie |date= |accessdate=2013-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Actors===
[[File:Sylvester Stallone.jpg|thumb|Actor [[Sylvester Stallone]] starred as a troubled Vietnam war vet who becomes a "one man army" in the popular ''[[Rambo (film series)|Rambo]]'' action films.]]
{{main|List of action film actors}}

Actors from the 1950s and 1960s, such as [[John Wayne]], [[Steve McQueen (actor)|Steve McQueen]], and [[Lee Marvin]], passed the torch in the 1970s to actors such as [[Bruce Lee]], [[Tom Laughlin]], [[Charles Bronson]], [[Chuck Norris]], [[Clint Eastwood]], and [[Sonny Chiba]]. In the 1980s, [[Mel Gibson]] and [[Danny Glover]] had a popular string of "buddy cop" films in the ''Lethal Weapon'' franchise. Beginning in the mid-1980s, actors such as ex-bodybuilder [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] and [[Sylvester Stallone]] wielded automatic weapons in a number of action films. Stern-faced martial artists [[Steven Seagal]] and [[Jean-Claude Van Damme]] made a number of films. [[Bruce Willis]] played a Western-inspired hero in the popular ''[[Die Hard (franchise)#Films|Die Hard]]'' series of action films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=  FILM; Wanted: New Action Stars|publisher= The New York Times|date=January 10, 1993|url= http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F00617F6355D0C738DDDA80894DB494D81|accessdate=2010-12-20|first=Pat H.|last=Broeske}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1990s and 2000s, Asian actors [[Chow Yun-fat]], [[Jet Li]], and [[Jackie Chan]] appeared in a number of different types of action films, and American actors [[Wesley Snipes]] and [[Vin Diesel]] both had many roles.

While [[Keanu Reeves]] and [[Harrison Ford]] both had major roles in action science fiction films (''[[The Matrix]]'' and ''[[Blade Runner]]'', respectively), they later branched out into a number of other action genres, such as action-adventure films.
American actor [[Matt Damon]], who was nominated for an [[Academy Award]] for his sensitive portrayal of a math genius working as a janitor in ''[[Good Will Hunting]]'', later morphed into an action hero with the car-chase-and-gunfire-filled [[Jason Bourne|''Jason Bourne'']] franchise. Same thing happened to star [[Tom Cruise]], who turned into a mature action star with the [[Mission: Impossible (film series)|''Mission: Impossible serie'']], [[Jack Reacher (film)|''Jack Reacher'']], and other films. [[Leonardo DiCaprio]] is another good example of it, but without a film franchise as the previous. European action actors such as Belgian [[Jean-Claude Van Damme]] (''[[Bloodsport (film)|Bloodsport]]'', ''[[Hard Target]]'', ''[[Timecop]]''), French [[Jean Reno]] (''[[Ronin (film)|Ronin]]'' and ''[[Mission: Impossible (film)|Mission: Impossible]]''), Swedish [[Dolph Lundgren]] (''[[Showdown in Little Tokyo]]'', ''[[Universal Soldier (1992 film)|Universal Soldier]]'', ''[[The Expendables (2010 film)|The Expendables]]''), Irish [[Colin Farrell]] (''[[SWAT (film)|SWAT]]'', ''[[Daredevil (film)|Daredevil]]'', ''[[Miami Vice (film)|Miami Vice]]''), and English [[Jason Statham]] (''[[The Transporter]]'', ''[[The Expendables (2010 film)|The Expendables]]'', ''[[Crank (film)|Crank]]'') appeared in a number of action films in the 1990s and 2000s.

===Female characters and actors===
{{main|List of female action heroes and villains}}
Female actors with major, active roles in action films include [[Bree Larson]], [[Elizabeth Olsen]] [[Michelle Yeoh]], [[Lucy Liu]], [[Cynthia Rothrock]], [[Michelle Rodriguez]], [[Milla Jovovich]], [[Kate Beckinsale]], [[Angelina Jolie]], [[Scarlett Johansson]], [[Uma Thurman]], [[Sandra Bullock]], [[Zoe Saldana]], [[Sigourney Weaver]], [[Linda Hamilton]], [[Sanaa Lathan]], [[Geena Davis]], [[Halle Berry]], [[Emily Blunt]], [[Zhang Ziyi]], [[Maggie Q]], [[Keira Knightley]], [[Charlize Theron]], [[Demi Moore]], [[Cameron Diaz]], [[Drew Barrymore]], [[Jennifer Lawrence]], [[Annette O'Toole]], [[Jennifer Connelly]], [[Brigitte Nielsen]], [[Carrie-Anne Moss]], [[Lori Petty]], [[Jessica Alba]], and [[Jamie Lee Curtis]].  After a successful career in stunts, [[Zoë Bell]] has recently crossed over to become an action star in her own right and [[Ronda Rousey]] and [[Gina Carano]] have both come from a mixed martial arts background to action roles.

Increasing numbers of films starring women as the action heroes are being produced.  These are celebrated by [http://www.artemisfilmfestival.com Artemis Women In Action Film Festival] which honours women who work as actors, stuntwomen, and directors in action films. [[Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media]] works to document the onscreen time and representation in women in all film types with a view to improving the equality of work for actresses.  Analysis of the lines spoken in action films shows many recent films in this genre are dominated by male dialogue.&lt;ref&gt;http://polygraph.cool/films/&lt;/ref&gt;  Analysis of the lines in 2016's biggest blockbusters show that despite much hype about the lead female in ''[[Rogue One]]'', and the female characters in ''[[Suicide Squad (2016 film)|Suicide Squad]]'' and ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]'', these characters still had limited share of dialogue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://medium.freecodecamp.com/women-only-said-27-of-the-words-in-2016s-biggest-movies-955cb480c3c4|title=Women only said 27% of the words in 2016’s biggest movies.|date=12 January 2017|publisher=|accessdate=7 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some male actors appear to champion the cause of women in action films.  [[Tom Cruise]] has been applauded for his asexual onscreen relationships with recent female co-stars,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sbs.com.au/movies/article/2016/10/24/best-place-women-action-movies-next-tom-cruise|title=The best place for women in action movies is next to Tom Cruise|work=SBS Movies|access-date=2017-09-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cobie Smulders]] in ''[[Jack Reacher: Never Go Back]]'' and [[Emily Blunt]] in ''[[Edge of Tomorrow]]''.  Tom Cruise has been honoured with an Artemis Action Rebel Award for his work in championing strong female heroes in film.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.artemisfilmfestival.com/2017-honorees/tom-cruise/|title=Tom Cruise - Artemis Women In Action Film Festival|work=Artemis Women In Action Film Festival|access-date=2017-09-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Directors===
Notable action film directors from the 1960s and 1970s include [[Sam Peckinpah]], whose 1969 Western ''[[The Wild Bunch]]'' was controversial for its bloody violence and nihilist tone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001603/|title=Sam Peckinpah|website=IMDb|access-date=2017-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Influential and popular directors from the 1980s to 2000s include [[James Cameron]] (for the first two ''[[The Terminator|Terminator]]'' films, ''[[Aliens (film)|Aliens]]'', ''[[True Lies]]''); [[Andrew Davis (filmmaker)|Andrew Davis]] (''[[Code of Silence (film)|Code of Silence]]'', ''[[Above the Law (film)|Above the Law]]'', ''[[Under Siege]]'', ''[[The Fugitive (1993 film)|The Fugitive]]''); [[John Woo]] (Hong Kong action films such as ''[[Hard Boiled]]'' and US-made English-language films such as ''[[Hard Target]]'', ''[[Broken Arrow (1996 film)|Broken Arrow]]'' and ''[[Face/Off]]''); [[John McTiernan]] (the [[Die Hard|first]] and [[Die Hard with a Vengeance|third]] ''[[Die Hard (franchise)|Die Hard]]'' films, ''[[Predator (film)|Predator]]'', ''[[The Last Action Hero]]''); [[Ridley Scott]] (''[[Black Rain (American film)|Black Rain]]'', ''[[Black Hawk Down (film)|Black Hawk Down]]''); [[The Wachowskis]] (''[[The Matrix]]'' trilogy), [[Andrzej Bartkowiak]] (''[[Romeo Must Die]]'', ''[[Exit Wounds]]'', ''[[Cradle 2 the Grave]]'', ''[[Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li]]''), [[Robert Rodriguez]] (''[[Mexico Trilogy|Mexico]]'' trilogy, ''[[From Dusk till Dawn]]'', ''[[Machete (2010 film)|Machete]]''), and [[Michael Bay]] (the first two ''[[Bad Boys (1995 film)|Bad Boys]]'' films, ''[[The Rock (film)|The Rock]]'', ''[[Transformers (film)|Transformers]]'' pentology); [[Louis Leterrier]] (the first two ''[[The Transporter|Transporter]]'' films, ''[[Unleashed (film)|Unleashed]]'').

'''''Affordable Space Adventures''''' is a [[puzzle game|puzzle]] [[adventure game|adventure]] game developed and published by [[KnapNok Games]] in collaboration with [[Nifflas|Nifflas' Games]].  The game was released for the [[Wii U]] via the [[Nintendo eShop]] download service on April 9, 2015. The game's main gameplay feature is its unique use of the Wii U Gamepad to control a spaceship by using the controls shown on the touch-screen.

==Plot==
In ''Affordable Space Adventures'', the player takes on the role of a customer who has purchased an "Affordable Space Adventure" from the company UExplore.  The game begins with a video that describes a newly discovered planet ready to be explored by the company's customers, even promising to allow them to take ownership of and colonize their own individual piece of the planet.  It introduces the customer to the Small Craft, their own personal vehicle with which they will explore the planet's surface, and describes the process by which the customer is to be placed on and retrieved from the planet.  All along the way, UExplore extols the virtues of its perfect safety record - more specifically that they have had no "recorded" accidents in two decades.

An unexplained incident occurs between the end of the video and the start of the game, where the player awakens to discover that the mother ship has crashed in a hostile extraterrestrial environment, leaving the player no choice but to explore his/her environment.  Along the way, the Small Craft slowly repairs its systems, bringing new functionality online at key points.  The player is also informed of alien "artifacts" that he/she must avoid disturbing at all costs, under penalty of fines.  The player searches for a functional distress beacon that will allow him/her to request emergency extraction.  However, the beacons that the player finds are damaged or otherwise non-functional, forcing further exploration.

As the game proceeds, more promotional videos emerge from UExplore talking about how safe their program is - so much so, in fact, that the company's safety director was given an extended vacation.

The player eventually comes upon an alien installation that has the ability to alter reality in short bursts.  The Small Craft penetrates this installation's defenses and causes a massive explosion, resulting in the ship being sent back to the surface, heavily damaged.  The player sets off again in search of another beacon.  The Small Craft begins to fall apart, system after system failing and shutting down until only the most basic systems are left online.  The player finally discovers a working beacon in the middle of a harsh blizzard that, despite generating maximum heat, threatens to freeze the Small Craft solid.  After filling out a casual survey form, the beacon puts the player in stasis to await extraction.  In a short scene after the credits, the player's survey form (including their [[Miiverse]] drawing if provided) emerges from an interstellar fax machine in the long-unoccupied office of UExplore's safety director, ending up on the floor with numerous other calls for help.

==Gameplay==
The goal of ''Affordable Space Adventures'' is to explore the environment of Spectaculon and find a means to request evacuation from the planet.  The player controls the Small Craft, a small flying ship that can move around in two dimensions and interact with its environment in limited ways.  A variety of systems are available to the player by pressing buttons on the [[Wii U GamePad|gamepad and its touch screen]], including a flashlight and scanner, two different engines, a mass generator, an anti-gravity device, several landing gears, etc.  The gamepad thus functions as the Small Craft's control panel, both allowing the player to control the ship and tweak its systems, and conveying important information about the environment and the ship's functions.

The game is broken up into a series of levels consisting of puzzles of increasing complexity.  Some puzzles require the player to open doors by pressing buttons hidden among the environment, while others are only passable by blocking lasers with objects found in the environment, or by sneaking past alien artifacts that will attack the Small Craft if it generates too much noise, heat or electrical radiation (a set of output meters indicate what each artifact's thresholds are after they are scanned).

Up to two additional players may join the game at the beginning using [[Wii Remote]]s or [[Wii Classic Controller]]s, taking over movement and scanning functions.  The game also features two difficulty levels, Tourist and Technical, and a separate [[Downloadable content|DLC]] pack, the Origin Story, consists of much harder levels.

== Origin Story DLC ==
In November 12 [[KnapNok Games]] released a free update for the game which fixed several bugs in the game as well as added five new levels in a separate mode named "Origin Story".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2015/11/free_origin_story_and_remaster_update_coming_to_affordable_space_adventures|title=Free Origin Story and 'Remaster' Update Coming to Affordable Space Adventures|last=Life|first=Nintendo|date=2015-11-09|website=Nintendo Life|access-date=2016-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new levels were meant for experienced players who have already finished the game and were looking for a new challenge, though once the update has been installed, players can choose to play those new levels anytime.

Upon launch, the game received generally positive reviews, with most media outlets calling out the integration of the Wii U's unique features. Patrick Hancock of ''[[Destructoid]]'' mentioned that "GamePad and [[Miiverse]] integration are perfect, and I'm not sure that sentence has been made before"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hancock|first1=Patrick|title=Review: Affordable Space Adventures|url=https://www.destructoid.com/review-affordable-space-adventures-289938.phtml|website=Destructoid}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Thomas Whitehead of ''[[Nintendo Life]]'' claiming it to be "one of the eShop's top-tier games".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Whitehead|first1=Thomas|title=Review: Affordable Space Adventures (Wii U eShop)|url=http://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/wiiu-eshop/affordable_space_adventures|website=Nintendo Life|date=6 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another aspect that got the attention of the media was the optional co-op multiplayer mode, which Andy Robertson of ''[[Forbes]]'' compared to live action ''[[Star Trek]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Robertson|first1=Andy|title='Affordable Space Adventures' Is Live Action 'Star Trek'|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/andyrobertson/2015/04/28/affordable-space-adventures-review/#687f01e5c41c|website=Forbes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Affordable Space Adventures received several awards. Prior to launch, the game already received the "Best of [[PAX East 2015]]" award by ''Destructoid'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.destructoid.com/here-are-destructoid-s-top-10-games-from-pax-east-2015-288751.phtml|title=Here are Destructoid's Top 10 games from PAX East 2015|website=Destructoid|access-date=2016-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and continued to receive subsequent awards after the game's launch. At the Danish SpilPrisen Awards in 2016, granted by the [[Danish Film Institute]], the game received awards for "Game of the Year", "Best Technical Achievement" and "Best Game Design",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dfi.dk/nyheder/filmupdate/2016/april/vinderne-af-spilprisen-2016.aspx|title=Vinderne af Spilprisen 2016|website=www.dfi.dk|access-date=2016-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; while at the Nordic Game Awards 2016 the game won the "Best Game Design" award.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nordicgame.com/nordic-game-awards-2016-winners-revealed/|title=Nordic Game Awards • Nordic Game 2016|date=2015-05-05|website=Nordic Game 2017|language=en-US|access-date=2016-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Alice Through the Looking Glass''''' is a 1987 Australian-Italian animated film nominally based on the novel ''[[Through the Looking-Glass]]'' by [[Lewis Carroll]].  It was directed by [[Andrea Bresciani]] and
[[Richard Slapczynski]] from a screenplay by [[Jameson Brewer]]. The movie starts off with a bored Alice trapped in her house by a snow storm. The film's voice cast includes [[Janet Waldo]] as Alice, [[Mr. T.]] as the [[Jabberwock]], [[Phyllis Diller]] as the White Queen, [[Jonathan Winters]] as Tweedledum and Tweedledee, and [[Alan Young]] as the White Knight. Much of the film consists of Alice and a [[jester]] named Tom Fool ([[Townsend Coleman]]) journeying through some of the incidents of the novel, while ultimately, the film is more about Alice finding an imaginary friend in Tom Fool than the novel's themes of logic, illogic, and reversal. The film also throws in [[Heffalumps]], rock-throwing [[cavemen]], [[Ed Sullivan]], [[The Marx Brothers]] ([[Hal Rayle]]) and [[Humpty Dumpty]] ([[George Gobel]]). There is also a man made entirely out of newspaper, a talking horse and a talking goat. When Alice wakes up, her father plays a game of chess with her, which her dream journey was based on, walking from square to square on a large chessboard.

==History==
America's Incredible Pizza Company, headquartered in Springfield, Missouri, is owned by Rick and Cheryl Barsness. The couple entered the pizza business with a single restaurant in [[Victoria, Texas]] and by 1975, owned 11 franchises of [[Gatti's Pizza]].

AIPC grew out of an idea from its founder, Rick Barsness. When Barsness was a [[ice hockey|hockey]] player in high school, his team reached the state championships, but his father never attended a game. His father's absence nurtured a boyhood dream of a place where families could eat and have fun together. This was the type of place Barsness wished he could have spent time with his father.&lt;ref name="Whiteman2"&gt;Whiteman (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|2}}

In 2003, years of legal battles came to an end when Rick Barsness agreed to pay Gatti's a $1 million [[settlement (litigation)|settlement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Zeke |last=MacCormack |title=Pizza chain settles suit with former franchiser Mr. Gatti's will get $1 million and a bit of new venture's revenue. |url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=SAEC&amp;p_theme=saec&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0FCEC061655FBFAF&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM |work=[[San Antonio Express-News]] |date=13 August 2003 |accessdate=2009-04-01 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5fhgE6wp4?url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=SAEC&amp;p_theme=saec&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0FCEC061655FBFAF&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date%3AD&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM |archivedate=2009-04-01 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mr. Gatti's had charged that Barsness had violated his franchise [[contract]] with them, and had taken [[trade secret]]s. In addition to the $1 million payout, Barsness also agreed to pay Mr. Gatti's Inc. 1% of IPC's net sales for the next 10 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=America's Incredible Pizza Company |url=http://vendors.pizzamarketplace.com/article.php?id=2676 |work=Pizza Marketplace |date=13 August 2003 |accessdate=2009-04-01 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5fhfq1Khb?url=http://vendors.pizzamarketplace.com/article.php?id=2676 |archivedate=2009-04-01 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

AIPC started franchising and established its corporate headquarters in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]] in 2003. It moved the headquarters to Springfield, Missouri in 2009.&lt;ref name=corporate&gt;{{cite web| url=http://incrediblepizza.com/corp/fun-for-kids/index.php| publisher=Incredible Pizza Company| title=Corporate Website: About Us| accessdate=2014-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

AIPC restaurants have an average of 250 employees and it costs $5&amp;ndash;9 million to start a restaurant.&lt;ref name="Whiteman5"&gt;Whiteman (2006), p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

America's Incredible Pizza announced that its location at [[Lafayette Square Mall]] in Indianapolis would close March 19, 2012.&lt;ref name=wrtv&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.theindychannel.com/news/lafayette-square-loses-major-tenant |title=Lafayette Square Loses Major Tenant| work=[[WRTV]] News |date=29 March 2012 |accessdate=2014-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Bristow''''' is a British [[gag-a-day]] comic strip created by [[Frank Dickens]] about a buying clerk of that name. The series was in continuous publication in the ''[[Aberdeen Press &amp; Journal]]'' in September 1961 until its last appearance in 2012. &lt;ref name="Dickens"/&gt; With over 10,000 strips made over the decades and running for over 51 years. ''Bristow'' is one of the longest running daily cartoon strips by a single author, according to [[Guinness World Records]].&lt;ref name="Guinness"/&gt; When looking at the character Bristow itself the series is even one year older than that, as Bristow debuted in Dickens' older series ''Oddbod'' in ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' in 1960. Due to his popularity he received his own [[spin-off (media)|spin-off]] series soon afterwards.&lt;ref name="Dickens"/&gt; Dickens broke the original record held by [[Marc Sleen]], whose ''[[The Adventures of Nero]]'' was drawn for 45 years without any assistance.&lt;ref name="lambiek.net"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lambiek.net/artists/s/sleen.htm |title=Marc Sleen (Biography) |accessdate=19 August 2018 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160422035032/https://www.lambiek.net/artists/s/sleen.htm |archivedate=22 April 2016 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id%3Dcil7WbXg8BkC%26pg%3DPA102%26lpg%3DPA102%26dq%3Dguinness+book+of+records+marc+sleen%26source%3Dbl%26ots%3D9LPW61KHwW%26sig%3DpR0OR272m4Cqhj1iznUKKg61K44%26hl%3Dnl%26sa%3DX%26ved%3D0CCQQ6AEwATgKahUKEwiIpNyj4MvHAhWDtRoKHaaJDKo#v=onepage&amp;q=guinness%20book%20of%20records%20marc%20sleen&amp;f=false |title=Comics &amp; Culture |page=102|accessdate=19 August 2018 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180819201347/https://books.google.com/books?dq=guinness+book+of+records+marc+sleen&amp;hl=nl&amp;id=cil7WbXg8BkC&amp;lpg=PA102&amp;ots=9LPW61KHwW&amp;pg=PA102&amp;sa=X&amp;sig=pR0OR272m4Cqhj1iznUKKg61K44&amp;source=bl&amp;ved=0CCQQ6AEwATgKahUKEwiIpNyj4MvHAhWDtRoKHaaJDKo#v=onepage&amp;q=guinness%20book%20of%20records%20marc%20sleen&amp;f=false |archivedate=19 August 2018 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, even Dickens' record has been broken in his turn by [[Jim Russell (cartoonist)|Jim Russell]], whose series ''[[The Potts]]'' ran for 62 years.&lt;ref name="lambiek.net"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Guinness"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/longest-running-cartoon-strip-by-a-single-artist |title=Longest running cartoon strip by a single artist |accessdate=19 August 2018 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160927183431/http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/longest-running-cartoon-strip-by-a-single-artist |archivedate=27 September 2016 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name="Dickens"/&gt;

==Background==
The cartoons follow the daily life of a buying clerk who works in the monolithic Chester-Perry building. He is a fantasist and has delusions of grandeur, wishing he were a brain surgeon and a writer. His epic tome ''Living Death in the Buying Department'' has yet to find a publisher, but he is not discouraged. He lives in a small bedsit in East Winchley and commutes to work by train, invariably arriving late. Bristow is surrounded by co-workers, Fudge (his overbearing manager), Jones, Hewitt, Dimkins, hapless typist Miss Sunman, master chef Gordon Blue, the Postboy  and the ever-gossiping Mrs. Purdy the Tealady. Bristow has a crush on routine visitor Miss Pretty of "Kleenaphone". Another regular visitor is the pigeon who sits on a window ledge. During the winter, the bird travels to a warmer climate where she visits Bristow's counterpart, a black man in a white suit. Bristow invariably holidays at a beach resort known as Funboys Sur La Plage.

Frank Dickens is often credited for "inventing" a cartoon device whereby he wrote the words of the action next to the character, such as "flinch flinch", as he was unable to draw expressions well enough to fit in the comic-strip boxes.

==Syndication==
The strip was widely syndicated in Great Britain and in Australia. It appeared in the Birmingham ''[[Birmingham Mail|Evening Mail]]'' and, between 1962 and 2001, appeared in the London ''[[Evening Standard]]'' newspaper. The ''[[Melbourne Age]]'' and ''[[Sydney Morning Herald]]'' published the strip from the late 1960s. Since 1966 at least eleven ''Bristow'' books have been published in the UK, as well as editions in Australia.&lt;ref name="Guter Bristow in Print"/&gt; A number of collections were published in Italy with the captions translated.

==Radio adaptation== 
"Bristow" was made into a [[BBC Radio 4]] series&lt;ref name="EpGuides Bristow"/&gt; written by Dickens and starring both [[Michael Williams (actor)|Michael Williams]] as Bristow and [[Rodney Bewes]] as his colleague Jones.&lt;ref name="The Independent April 1999"/&gt; There were 14 half-hour episodes made from April 1999 to July 2000,&lt;ref name="Evening Standard April 2001"/&gt; with frequent repeats on [[BBC 7]].&lt;ref name="UtterTrivia Bristow"/&gt; (Radio 4 Extra).

==Stage adaptation==

In 1971 the strip was also adapted into a theatrical play. &lt;ref name="Dickens"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lambiek.net/artists/d/dickens_frank.htm |title=Frank Dickens (Biography) |publisher=Lambiek|accessdate=19 August 2018 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160918014042/https://www.lambiek.net/artists/d/dickens_frank.htm |archivedate=18 September 2016 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Bumpy''''', also known as '''''Pop-Up''''' and '''''Cool-Ball''''', is a [[2D computer graphics|2D]] [[platform game|platforming]] [[video game]] created by [[Loriciels]]. It was released in 1989 for [[ZX Spectrum]], [[Amstrad CPC]], [[Atari ST]], [[MSX]] and [[DOS]]&lt;ref name="Bumpy"&gt;http://www.mobygames.com/game/bumpy&lt;/ref&gt;. A remake of the game was created in 1992 with the name '''''Bumpy's Arcade Fantasy'''''.

Loriciels wanted a 16-bit game so they handed it over to [[Infogrames]] who made ''Pop-up'' in 1991. The loading screen and graphics changed but the music sound effects and gameplay remained the same.{{cn|date=April 2017}}

==Gameplay&lt;ref name="Bumpy" /&gt;==
The player controls a ball, trying to get it to the exit by bouncing it off walls and various types of platforms. While most platforms are perfectly harmless, some have additional qualities, such as being destructible, thereby granting access to other parts of the screen. Some platforms are on fire, which will turn out lethal unless the player has picked up a water droplet in advance.

'''Cosmote TV''' is the corporate name for two [[pay television]] services in [[Greece]], owned by Greek [[telecommunication]] operator [[OTE]]. The two services are as follows:

*'''Cosmote TV via Broadband''' - [[IPTV]] service
*'''Cosmote TV via Satellite''' - [[Direct-broadcast satellite|satellite]] television service

Cosmote TV Satellite broadcasts on Ku band from Eutelsat's [[Eurobird 9A]] at 9.0°E featuring DVB-S2 -8PSK/MPEG-4 technology. In June 2012 OTE TV had 76,345 subscribers. In July 2017, after more than 5 years of operation, it was announced that the (now) Cosmote TV package has reached 510,000 subscribers.

==History==
In 2009, Greek Telecommunications giant OTE launched an IPTV service called '''Conn-x-TV'''. It was initially available in [[Athens]], [[Thessaloniki]], Patras, Larisa &amp; Iraklion, it is available in most of [[Greece]].

In October 2011, ''Conn-x TV'' was re-branded as ''OTE TV via Conn-x''. At the same time, OTE launched their long anticipated satellite service known as ''OTE TV via Satellite''. Both services operate under the ''OTE TV'' brand and contain the same logo.

In March 2012 OTE TV had 63,497 subscribers. By the end of June 2012, reports say that the subscribers of OTE TV, both satellite and IP customers, had reached a total of 76,345. In November 2013, OTE TV reached 230,000 subscribers, most of them using the satellite service. In August 2014, the number of OTE TV subscribers surpassed 300,000 customers.

By the end of June 2015 OTE TV had 377,548 subscribers, while in June 2016 the platform had 458,920 subscribers (21.6% rise).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.digitaltvinfo.gr/news/media-news/item/18027-thilia-sti-syndromitiki-tileorasi-i-kyvernitiki-forologisi|title=Θηλιά στη συνδρομητική τηλεόραση η κυβερνητική φορολόγηση|date=5 Σεπτεμβρίου 2016|website=digitaltvinfo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2016, OTE TV announced the creation of OTE History, Greece's first local documentary channel, exclusively focused to Greek history, culture, and civilisation. The channel broadcasts documentaries licensed by Greece's most acclaimed documentary producers and global distribution companies as well as its own original productions. CEO of OTE Group Michael Tsamaz said in a press conference held for the presentation of the channel prior to launch: "OTE HISTORY is an important project for OTE, an organisation closely tied to the modern Greek history, with special cultural role and responsibility. With documentaries and high-quality shows with high aesthetic standards on the history, the culture, the people and the traditions of our country, this channel can be a new spot of entertainment and education for viewers. OTE HISTORY was created with a lot of effort, vision and respect for the content and its audience. It is our legacy to future generations".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cosmote.gr/fixed/en/corporate/media-center/news/details/-/asset_publisher/wpF6f9kWWozI/content/ote-history-%CF%84%CE%BF-%CF%80%CF%81%CF%89%CF%84%CE%BF-%CE%BA%CE%B1%CE%BD%CE%B1%CE%BB%CE%B9-%CE%BD%CF%84%CE%BF%CE%BA%CE%B9%CE%BC%CE%B1%CE%BD%CF%84%CE%B5%CF%81-%CE%B3%CE%B9%CE%B1-%CF%84%CE%B7%CE%BD-%CE%B5%CE%BB%CE%BB%CE%B1%CE%B4%CE%B1=|title= OTE HISTORY: The first documentary channel for Greece |date=20 Ιανουαρίου 2016|website=Cosmote}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2016 the OTE TV platform surpassed Nova Greece's subscribers reaching 462,000 customers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cnn.gr/money/epixeiriseis/story/45255/h-forologia-frenare-tin-agora-syndromitikis-tileorasis|title=Η φορολογία "φρέναρε" την αγορά συνδρομητικής τηλεόρασης|date=6 Σεπτεμβρίου 2016|website=Cnn Greece}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2016 ''OTE TV'' was re-branded as ''Cosmote TV'' and its respective branded channels as Cosmote Cinema, Cosmote Sports, and Cosmote History. 
Moreover, as of November 2016, Cosmote TV has agreements with three of the six major studios, [[Walt Disney Pictures]], [[Paramount Pictures]] and [[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]].

In January 2017 Cosmote TV reached 500,000 subscribers.

In July 2017 it was referred that Cosmote TV had reached 510,000 subscribers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sport24.gr/Columns/panos-voglis/h-ert-sthrigma-ths-kentrikhs-diaxeirishs.4758743.html|title=Η ΕΡΤ στήριγμα της κεντρικής διαχείρισης|date=10 Ιουλίου 2017|website=Cnn Greece}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, Cosmote TV did not renew its co-operation with [[Discovery Communications]] as discussions between the two parties have not led to a mutually acceptable agreement. Therefore the following 8 channels: [[Discovery Channel Europe|Discovery Channel]], [[Discovery HD Showcase]], [[Discovery Science (European TV channel)|Discovery Science]], [[Investigation Discovery (Europe)|Investigation Discovery]], [[Animal Planet (Europe)|Animal Planet]], [[Eurosport 1]], [[Eurosport 2]] and [[TLC (TV network)|TLC]] will be replaced by [[BBC Earth (TV channel)|BBC Earth]], [[Crime &amp; Investigation Network (Europe)|Crime &amp; Investigation Network]], [[CBS Reality]], [[Fine Living (Europe)|Fine Living]], [[Food Network]], [[Fox Sports]], [[Nautical Channel]], [[Outdoor Channel]], [[Viasat Explore]] and [[Viasat Nature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dziadul|first1=Chris|title=OTE’s Cosmote to drop Discovery channels|url=https://www.broadbandtvnews.com/2017/09/06/otes-cosmote-to-drop-discovery-channels/|accessdate=28 September 2017|publisher=broadbandtvnews.com|date=6 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Donald T. Sterling''' (born '''Donald Tokowitz''', April 26, 1934) is an American businessman. He was the owner of the [[Los Angeles Clippers]] professional [[basketball]] franchise of the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA) from 1981 to 2014.

In April 2014, Sterling was banned from the NBA for life and fined $2.5 million by the league after private recordings of him making [[Racism in the United States|racist]] comments were made public.&lt;ref name=lifeban&gt;{{cite news|last=Gregory|first=Sean|title=NBA Bans Donald Sterling 'For Life' After Racist Rant|url=http://time.com/81170/donald-sterling-los-angeles-clippers-nba-adam-silver/|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=April 29, 2014|accessdate=April 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In May, Sterling's wife Shelly reached an agreement for the Sterling Family Trust to sell the Clippers for $2 billion to [[Steve Ballmer]], which Sterling contested in court.

==Legal and real estate career==
[[File:Sterling Plaza Beverly Hills 2015.jpg|thumb|right|The Sterling Plaza in Beverly Hills, California.]]
Starting in 1961, Sterling began to make his career as a divorce and [[personal injury attorney]] building an independent practice when Jews had few opportunities at prestigious law firms.&lt;ref name=espn090601&gt;{{cite news |last=Keating |first=Peter |title=Uncontested: The life of Donald Sterling |date=June 1, 2009 |magazine=ESPN The Magazine |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=4187729 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090524004815/http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=4187729 |archivedate=May 24, 2009 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; His biggest ventures were in [[real estate]], which he began when he purchased a 26-unit apartment building in [[Beverly Hills, California|Beverly Hills]].

In the 1960s, Sterling also purchased [[Lesser Towers]], a pair of large apartment buildings in the [[Westwood, Los Angeles|Westwood]] area of Los Angeles,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/485776292.html?FMT=AI&amp;FMTS=::AI:CITE:PAGE&amp;type=historic&amp;date=Sep+18,+1966&amp;author=&amp;pub=Los+Angeles+Times&amp;desc=22-STORY+APARTMENT+NEARING+COMPLETION|title=Los Angeles Times: Archives|website=pqasb.pqarchiver.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and renamed them the Sterling Towers (now the Sterling International Towers). In 1976, he leased the California Bank Building on [[Wilshire Boulevard]] in Beverly Hills, and renamed it [[Sterling Plaza]]. The [[Art Deco]] landmark was built in 1930 by [[MGM]] cofounder [[Louis B. Mayer]]. In 2000, [[Sports Illustrated]] senior writer [[Franz Lidz]] revealed that Sterling had a 99-year lease with the Mayer estate that required him to pay a relatively small annual fee and 15% of any rental income. Which was why for many years Sterling remained the sole tenant. "With no other tenant," Lidz reported, "the Mayer estate faces another 75 years with virtually no income from its Sterling Plaza property. By sitting and waiting, Sterling may force a fire sale."&lt;ref name="autogenerated38"/&gt;&lt;ref name="marcwanamakerartdeco"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Nz-yCad3ZQAC&amp;pg=PA1948&amp;lpg=PA1948&amp;dq=california+bank+building+beverly+hills&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=TuWaKo_zvO&amp;sig=92A3KrtB19_hajwPTBmG9FtgGaU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=0Vh0VKTlFYWF8QWq6oK4Cw&amp;ved=0CGAQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=california%20bank%20building%20beverly%20hills&amp;f=false Marc Wanamaker, ''Beverly Hills: 1930-2005'', Arcadia Publishing, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; As of April 2014, he owned 162 properties in Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;Adrian Glick Kudler, [http://la.curbed.com/archives/2014/04/the_revealing_map_of_donald_sterlings_162_la_properties.php The Revealing Map of Donald Sterling's 162 Donald Sterling Properties], ''LA Curbed'', April 29, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==NBA ownership==
Sterling and [[Los Angeles Lakers]] majority owner [[Jerry Buss]] were each indirectly responsible for the other owning his respective NBA franchise.&lt;ref name="autogenerated38"/&gt; The first instance came in 1979, when Buss used the money he made from selling a portion of his apartment buildings to Sterling (worth $2.7 million), which covered the remaining balance in purchasing the Lakers, the [[Los Angeles Kings|Kings]] hockey team, and [[The Forum (Inglewood)|The Los Angeles Forum]] from [[Jack Kent Cooke]] for $67 million.  Two years later, Buss suggested to Sterling that he could purchase his own NBA franchise, and Sterling bought the struggling [[San Diego Clippers]] for $12.5 million.

At his introductory news conference in [[San Diego]], Sterling vowed to "spend unlimited sums" to build the Clippers into a contender, and he embarked on a county-wide marketing campaign featuring his smiling face on billboards and the backs of buses.&lt;ref name="autogenerated38"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Canepa|first=Nick|title=Sterling never belonged here, but his departed NBA team did|date=May 16, 1984|newspaper=The Evening Tribune|page=D-1|quote='I'm willing to spend unlimited sums to build a winner here,' Donald T. gushed at his introductory news conference.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=goldaper&gt;{{cite news|last=Goldaper |first=Sam |title=Clippers Are Showing Signs of Revival |date=November 13, 1983 |newspaper=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/11/13/sports/clippers-are-showing-signs-of-revival.html |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6QLNCHip7?url=http://www.nytimes.com/1983/11/13/sports/clippers-are-showing-signs-of-revival.html |archivedate=June 15, 2014 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Newman|first=Bruce|title=Can The Nba Save Itself?|date=November 1, 1982|magazine=Sports Illustrated|url=http://cnnsi.printthis.clickability.com/pt/cpt?expire=&amp;title=On+the+eve+of+its+37th+season%2C+the+league+is+faced+with+-+11.01.82+-+SI+Vault&amp;urlID=415271632&amp;action=cpt&amp;partnerID=289881&amp;fb=Y&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fsportsillustrated.cnn.com%2Fvault%2Farticle%2Fmagazine%2FMAG1126059%2F2%2Findex.htm|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6QLOwk2pX?url=http://cnnsi.printthis.clickability.com/pt/cpt?expire=&amp;title=On+the+eve+of+its+37th+season%2C+the+league+is+faced+with+-+11.01.82+-+SI+Vault&amp;urlID=415271632&amp;action=cpt&amp;partnerID=289881&amp;fb=Y&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fsportsillustrated.cnn.com%2Fvault%2Farticle%2Fma|archivedate=June 15, 2014|deadurl=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The seminal ads read: "My Promise: I will make you proud of the Clippers".&lt;ref name=goldaper/&gt; Unlike Buss' instant success with the Lakers (including winning an NBA championship in his first season as owner, 1979–80), Sterling and his Clippers struggled through many lackluster seasons, and they did not have their first winning season until the 1991–92 season, 11 years into his ownership. In Sterling's 33 years of owning the Clippers through 2013–14, the Clippers lost 50 or more games 22 times, 60 or more on eight occasions, and 70 games once. Their 9–41 record in the lockout-shortened [[1998–99 Los Angeles Clippers season|1998–99 season]] projected to another 60-loss season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ryan |first=Bob |title=Donald Sterling profile is not a pretty picture |date=April 29, 2014 |newspaper=The Boston Globe |url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/sports/2014/04/28/the-donald-sterling-profile-not-pretty-picture/jZx4v3EWUFdLYh9c289ODL/story.html |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6PEx8UddJ?url=http://www.bostonglobe.com/sports/2014/04/28/the-donald-sterling-profile-not-pretty-picture/jZx4v3EWUFdLYh9c289ODL/story.html |archivedate=May 1, 2014 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NBA in [[1981–82 San Diego Clippers season|1982]] fined Sterling $10,000, the largest sum ever levied against an owner at the time, after he commented that he would accept the Clippers finishing in last place in order to [[NBA draft|draft]] an impact player like [[Ralph Sampson]].&lt;ref name=goldaper/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated38"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sterling Fined $10,000|date=January 9, 1982|newspaper=Reading Eagle|page=10|agency=Associated Press|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=-wIiAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=jqYFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3276%2C4367523|accessdate=April 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1982, Sterling attempted to move the team to Los Angeles. This prompted an investigation of the Clippers by an NBA committee of six owners.  In September, the group recommended that Sterling's ownership be terminated, having found that he was late in paying creditors and players.&lt;ref name=goldaper/&gt; Days before a league scheduled vote in October to remove Sterling, he agreed to sell the team, and the league sought buyers who would keep the franchise in San Diego. At the suggestion of [[David Stern]], then the league's vice president, Sterling handed over operations of the team to [[Alan Rothenberg]], who became the team's president. By February 1983, Stern called the Clippers a "first-class" franchise, and the ouster of Sterling was no longer pursued.&lt;ref name=goldaper/&gt;&lt;ref name=dohnrmann_05302014&gt;{{cite news|last=Dohrmann|first=George|title=Recently banned Donald Sterling has long history of clashing with NBA|date=May 30, 2014|work=SI.com|url=http://si.printthis.clickability.com/pt/cpt?expire=&amp;title=Clippers+owner+Donald+Sterling+has+history+of+clashing+with+NBA+-+NBA+-+George+Dohrmann+-+SI.com&amp;urlID=529418042&amp;action=cpt&amp;partnerID=2356&amp;fb=Y&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fsportsillustrated.cnn.com%2Fnba%2Fnews%2F20140530%2Fdonald-sterling-history%2F%23all|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6QLSIamtP?url=http://si.printthis.clickability.com/pt/cpt?expire=&amp;title=Clippers+owner+Donald+Sterling+has+history+of+clashing+with+NBA+-+NBA+-+George+Dohrmann+-+SI.com&amp;urlID=529418042&amp;action=cpt&amp;partnerID=2356&amp;fb=Y&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fsportsillustrated.cnn.com%2Fnba%2Fne|archivedate=June 15, 2014|deadurl=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Encouraged by friend [[Al Davis]]' victory over the [[National Football League]] in an [[antitrust]] lawsuit that allowed him to move his [[Oakland Raiders]] to Los Angeles without league approval, Sterling moved the Clippers from San Diego to Los Angeles in 1984.&lt;ref name=shelburne_06192014&gt;{{cite news|last=Shelburne |first=Ramona |title=The sad last chapter of Sterling's life |date=June 19, 2014 |work=ESPN.com |url=http://espn.go.com/nba/story/_/id/11105717/sad-last-chapter-donald-sterling-life |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6QStvNKAq?url=http://espn.go.com/nba/story/_/id/11105717/sad-last-chapter-donald-sterling-life |archivedate=June 20, 2014 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the move was not approved by the NBA, which fined him $25 million.

This was a record for the most victories in a single season since the franchise moved to California. It was also only the second winning season in Sterling's tenure as owner.  In the lockout-shortened 2011–2012 season they made the playoffs with the best winning percentage in their history (.606) and they won their first round series against the Memphis Grizzlies, 4–3, before being swept by the San Antonio Spurs, 4–0, in the conference semi-finals.  Led by [[Blake Griffin]] and [[Chris Paul]], the Clippers posted two more winning campaigns in [[2012–13 Los Angeles Clippers season|2012–13]] and [[2013–14 Los Angeles Clippers season|2013–14]], setting new franchise records for regular-season wins with 56 and 57, respectively.

Sterling rebuffed numerous offers from other cities to relocate the Clippers and was steadfast in his refusal to move the team out of Los Angeles, let alone sell the team.  While the team played a few games in [[Anaheim]] in the [[Arrowhead Pond]] (now the Honda Center) for a few years before the Staples Center opened, he was not willing to move the team there permanently.  In later years, he showed an increased willingness to spend. In 2003, Sterling signed [[Elton Brand]] to a six-year, $82 million deal, the biggest contract in franchise history. He matched the contract the [[Utah Jazz]] offered [[Nba free agency#Types of free agency|restricted free agent]] [[Corey Maggette]]: a deal worth $45 million over six years. The Clippers signed higher-priced veteran free agents, such as [[Cuttino Mobley]] in 2005, [[Tim Thomas (basketball)|Tim Thomas]] in 2006, and Los Angeles native [[Baron Davis]] in 2008. In another first during the Sterling tenure of Clippers ownership, the team gave a four-year contract extension to head coach [[Mike Dunleavy, Sr.]], as well as a five-year extension to center [[Chris Kaman]].

U.S. District Judge Fernando M. Olguin dismissed the lawsuit in March 2016. The judge assailed it as "plainly insufficient" and "clearly implausible."
Sterling appealed the decision, undeterred by the latest in a series of legal defeats. But the 82-year-old's attorneys didn't file an opening brief by the deadline.

==Discrimination lawsuits==
In February 2003, the Housing Rights Center of Los Angeles filed a housing discrimination case against Sterling on behalf of 18 tenants. The lawsuit featured several racist statements allegedly made by Sterling to employees, such as that "black people smell and attract vermin" and "hispanics just smoke and hang around the building" as well as Sterling's alleged intent to rent only to Korean tenants because "they will pay the rent and live in whatever conditions I give them". Part of the HRC case's resolution included U.S. District Judge Dale Fischer awarding the plaintiffs' attorney $4.9 million in attorneys fees. While the final terms for the plaintiffs were confidential, the judge said the fees were justified as the settlement obtained by the plaintiffs against Sterling was one of the largest of its kind and the public benefit terms were significant and wide-ranging.

In 2006, the U.S. Department of Justice then sued Sterling for housing discrimination for using race as a factor in filling some of his apartment buildings. The suit charged that Sterling refused to rent to non-Koreans in the Koreatown neighborhood and to African Americans in Beverly Hills.&lt;ref name=LAT021309bp&gt;Bill Plaschke, [http://www.latimes.com/sports/la-sp-plaschke-clippers13-2009feb13,0,3110226.column There are no winners in Elgin Baylor's lawsuit against Clippers], ''Los Angeles Times'', February 13, 2009.

In 1996, Christine Jaksy, a property management consultant for Sterling who also did work for the Clippers, sued Sterling for sexual harassment, claiming she quit her job after he repeatedly offered her money for sex, and asked her to recruit sexual partners for him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Torrid Clippers Go Afoul in End |date=April 4, 1996 |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |agency=Associated Press |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1996-04-04/sports/sp-54814_1_torrid-clippers |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Q19NW2DU?url=http://articles.latimes.com/1996-04-04/sports/sp-54814_1_torrid-clippers |archivedate=June 2, 2014 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=fish_06012014&gt;{{cite news|last=Fish |first=Mike |title=OTL: NBA lax in Sterling oversight |date=June 1, 2014 |work=ESPN.com |url=http://espn.go.com/espn/otl/story/_/id/11003074/otl-nba-investigate-prior-donald-sterling-incidents |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Q19saNku?url=http://espn.go.com/espn/otl/story/_/id/11003074/otl-nba-investigate-prior-donald-sterling-incidents |archivedate=June 2, 2014 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sterling countersued, and the two eventually reached a confidential settlement in 1998.&lt;ref name=fish_06012014/&gt;

Sumner Davenport, a property supervisor for Sterling who was fired in 2002, sued him in 2003 for sexual harassment for "unwanted and offensive physical conduct".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sterling Is Sued for Harassment |date=July 20, 2003 |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |agency=Associated Press |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2003/jul/30/sports/sp-nbarep30 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Q1AQX8JQ?url=http://articles.latimes.com/2003/jul/30/sports/sp-nbarep30 |archivedate=June 2, 2014 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; She lost the case at a jury trial two years later.&lt;ref name=fish_06012014/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kristensen |first1=Kim |last2=Fenno |first2=Nathan |title=Outcry over Sterling's remarks renew focus on housing bias lawsuits |date=May 28, 2014 |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |url=http://www.latimes.com/local/la-me-shelly-sterling-housing-lawsuits-20140529-story.html#page=1 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Q1B5mQk8?url=http://www.latimes.com/local/la-me-shelly-sterling-housing-lawsuits-20140529-story.html |archivedate=June 2, 2014 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Court documents indicate that Davenport was a property supervisor based in Sterling's Beverly Hills office, with the responsibilities of overseeing several of his apartment buildings. In her case, she asserted she was fired for her complaints against and refusing to comply with his racially discriminating and abusive behavior against tenants, his illegal eviction process, as well as his offensive physical conduct against her. Court records indicate Sterling's organization denies firing her.&lt;ref&gt;Superior Court of the State of California for the County of Los Angeles, Case #BC299818&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
In 1955, Sterling married Rochelle ("Shelly") Stein, with whom he had three children: Scott, Chris, and Joanna. Joanna's husband, Eric Miller, served as the Clippers' director of basketball administration, voluntarily leaving after Sterling sold the team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bolch |first=Ben |title=Donald Sterling's son-in-law voluntarily leaves Clippers organization |date=September 24, 2014 |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |url=http://www.latimes.com/sports/clippers/la-sp-steve-ballmer-clippers-20140925-story.html |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6W86lOGoZ?url=http://www.latimes.com/sports/clippers/la-sp-steve-ballmer-clippers-20140925-story.html |archivedate=February 6, 2015 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sterling had a relationship with a woman named Alexandra Castro. Seeking the return of a house she was living in, Sterling sued her in 2003 after their relationship ended.&lt;ref name=witz_4272014/&gt;&lt;ref name="hill_murray"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/donald-sterlings-2002-battle-mistress-similarities-today/story?id=23521332&amp;singlePage=true|title=Donald Sterling's 2002 Battle With an Ex-Mistress Has Similarities to Today|date=April 30, 2014|work=abcnews.go.com|last2=Murray|first2=Rheana|last1=Hill|first1=James|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6PGVpC4kk?url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/donald-sterlings-2002-battle-mistress-similarities-today/story?id=23521332&amp;singlePage=true|archivedate=May 2, 2014|deadurl=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Castro, in 1999, had signed a contract that gave Sterling protection from her seeking [[palimony]], which divides assets between unmarried couples. Their agreement read that Sterling "is happily married, has a family and has no intention of engaging in any activity inconsistent with his domestic relationship".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Dockterman |first=Eliana |title=Donald Sterling’s ‘Friendship Agreements’ Explained |date=May 9, 2014 |work=Time.com |url=http://time.com/93952/donald-sterling-mistress-contracts-palimony/ |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6PVfqsHgA?url=http://time.com/93952/donald-sterling-mistress-contracts-palimony/ |archivedate=May 12, 2014 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ryan |first=Harriet |last2=Kim |first2=Victoria |title=The women in Donald Sterling's life |date=May 6, 2014 |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |url=http://www.latimes.com/local/la-me-sterling-stiviano-20140504-story.html#page=1 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6PVg2GDRZ?url=http://www.latimes.com/local/la-me-sterling-stiviano-20140504-story.html |archivedate=May 12, 2014 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the proceedings, Castro stated that Sterling consulted her on Clippers personnel decisions.&lt;ref name=witz_4272014/&gt;  Sterling and Castro reached a confidential settlement out of court in 2004.&lt;ref name=hill_murray/&gt;

Sterling and Shelly became estranged at the end of 2012, when he moved to a mansion in [[Beverly Hills, California]], after she kicked him out of their beach house in [[Malibu, California]], following a family [[Christmas dinner]] in which he was arguing with a mistress on the phone.&lt;ref name=shelburne_06192014/&gt; A week later, Sterling's son Scott was found dead on New Year's night, having died of an accidental drug overdose at the age of 32 after injecting himself with narcotics that were formulated for oral use.&lt;ref name=shelburne_06192014/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Blankstein, A. and Stevens, M., [http://articles.latimes.com/2013/apr/22/local/la-me-scott-sterling-cause-death-20130416 Death of Scott Sterling, Son of Clippers Owner, Ruled Accidental], ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', April 22, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 5, 2015, Sterling's attorney [[Bobby Samini]] confirmed to [[KABC-TV]] that Sterling filed for divorce from his wife Shelly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abc7.com/news/donald-sterling-files-for-divorce-from-wife-shelly-sterling-attorney-confirms/905197/|title=DONALD STERLING FILES FOR DIVORCE FROM WIFE SHELLY STERLING, ATTORNEY CONFIRMS|publisher=[[KABC-TV]]|date=August 5, 2015|accessdate=August 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ocregister.com/articles/sterling-676087-donald-divorce.html|title=Former Clippers owners Donald and Shelly Sterling file for divorce|work=[[Orange County Register]]|date=August 5, 2015|accessdate=August 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Sterling began treatment for [[prostate cancer]].&lt;ref name=shelburne_06192014/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bresnahan |first1=Mike |last2=Turner |first2=Broderick |title=Clippers owner Donald Sterling has prostate cancer, source says |date=May 2, 2014 |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |url=http://www.latimes.com/sports/sportsnow/la-sp-ln-clipper-owner-donald-sterling-has-prostate-cancer-20140502-story.html |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6QSvMu5Uw?url=http://www.latimes.com/sports/sportsnow/la-sp-ln-clipper-owner-donald-sterling-has-prostate-cancer-20140502-story.html |archivedate=June 20, 2014 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; By May 2014, according to multiple doctors Sterling was in the early developing stages of [[Alzheimer's disease]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/2014/05/30/donald-sterling-los-angeles-alzheimers-sale/9788985/|title=Donald Sterling diagnosed with Alzheimer's symptoms|publisher=USA Today|accessdate=13 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was deemed mentally unfit to continue to lead the financial affairs of the Sterling Family Trust, clearing the way for his wife Shelly to sell the [[Los Angeles Clippers]] on his behalf despite his protests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/clippers/2014/05/30/donald-sterling-mental-health-shelly-los-angeles-sale-steve-ballmer/9754549/|title=Donald Sterling ruled mentally unfit, can't prevent Clippers sale|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Echoes''''' is an American five-issue [[comic book]] [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]] written by [[Joshua Hale Fialkov]] and drawn by [[Rahsan Ekedal]].&lt;ref name="MTV"&gt;{{cite web |title=Comic &amp;ndash; Echoes #1 |publisher=[[MTV]] |date=December 29, 2010 |url=http://www.mtv.com/geek/comic/issue/506/echoes-1.jhtml |accessdate=September 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Published by [[Top Cow Productions]], it tells the story of Brian Cohn, a man with [[schizophrenia]] who learns his father may have been a [[serial killer]]. The first issue was released in December 29, 2010.&lt;ref name="Truitt"&gt;{{cite news |last=Truitt |first=Brian |title='Echoes' brings the creeps back to comics |work=[[USA Today]] |date=December 29, 2010 |url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/comics/2010-12-29-Echoes_N.htm |accessdate=September 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publication history==
Joshua Hale Fialkov and Rahsan Ekedal first worked together in 2008 on ''[[The Cleaners (comic)|The Cleaners]]'', a horror comic book series for the publisher [[Dark Horse Comics]].&lt;ref name = "Truitt"/&gt; Fialkov brought the story to Ekedal in its early stages, and Ekedal provided some concept art to accompany the pitch. After being accepted by Top Cow, Fialkov crafted the story mostly by himself, although he did adapt the script to Ekedal's style.&lt;ref name = "MV interview"&gt;Bradley, Drew, "[http://multiversitycomics.com/interviews/artist-august-rahsan-ekedal-interview/ Artist August: Rashan Ekedal interview]", www.multiversitycomics.com, 15 August 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The art in ''Echoes'' is completely black and white, which was more affordable for the artists, but also because Failkov felt grayscale was more effective. The artistic style was inspired by the [[Warren Publishing]] horror comic books ''[[Creepy (magazine)|Creepy]]'' and ''[[Eerie]]'' from the 1960s and 1970s, which both Fialkov and Ekedal enjoyed. Ekedal said of the artistic style: "A lot of the look developed out of my attempts to visually represent what it means to suffer from a serious mental disorder. So I tried to put Brian's doubts and terrors into every shadow, every line."&lt;ref name="Truitt" /&gt;

Fialkov said the idea of a suburban setting with an ordinary-seeming killer was conceived because its "so much scarier and so much more upsetting" than an urban setting. The idea of the dolls made from victims' flesh came from Fialkov's research about voodoo, as well as his own interest in cults and secret societies. Fialkov also said ''Echoes'' was partially inspired by the 1960 horror film ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'', directed by [[Alfred Hitchcock]], because he felt both stories were driven by the characters and drama rather than the horror.&lt;ref name="Truitt" /&gt; Fialkov described the series as "achingly dark", and said of writing it: "I haven't really done a hard horror book in a long time. It was a lot of fun to actually do something that's just grotesque and upsetting."&lt;ref name="Truitt" /&gt;

The first issue was included in the September 2010 release of ''Top Cow First Look'', a trade paperback highlighting several of the publisher's new releases. The first issue was officially released on December 29, 2010.&lt;ref name="Truitt" /&gt; Ekedal said the book's reception far exceeded his expectations, with four [[Harvey Award]] nominations and fans asking him about it more than two years after its completion.&lt;ref name="MV interview"/&gt;

The series was collected into a single hardcover volume in July [[2011 in comics|2011]]. A signed set of all five issues (second printing of issue 1) was made available in January [[2012 in comics|2012]]. Ekedal struggled to complete his portion of the signatures due to a wrist injury.&lt;ref name="MV interview"/&gt;

Fialkov hinted at the possibility of a sequel in the letter column of issue five.&lt;ref&gt;''Echoes'' #5&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2012 interview, Ekedal said it could happen if the hardcover continued to sell, but no project had been started.&lt;ref name="MV interview"/&gt;

==Plot==
Brian Cohn, a medicated [[schizophrenic]], visits his dying father (who also has schizophrenia and suffers from [[Alzheimer's disease]]) in a hospital. With his final breaths, he tells Brian an address and speaks cryptically about dead girls. Brian investigates the house and discovers a large pile of human bones and a box filled with small dolls made from flesh.&lt;ref&gt;''Echoes'' #1 (Dec 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

Unsure what to do, Brian takes the box back to his home and tells no one. The stress of this discovery aggravates Brian's condition, and he begins to hear voices and hallucinate dead girls. In particular, he hears his father telling him to continue his work. When a young girl Brian sees disappears, he worries that he killed her. When Detective Neville visits Brian to inquire about the girl, Brian lies about seeing another man following her. Later, Brian receives a small package that contains a new doll made from the missing girl.&lt;ref&gt;''Echoes'' #2 (Jan 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

Detective Neville returns and invites Brian to accompany him to arrest a handicapped man matching the description Brian had given. The man happens to have an alibi, but Brian's condition is further aggravated by the stress. After Neville leaves, Brian finds a girl's sneaker under his car's passenger seat.&lt;ref&gt;''Echoes'' #3 (Feb 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

Brian learns of the Alzheimer's symptom [[Echolalia]], and returns to the hospital to research his father's roommate. The roommate used to live in the house in which Brian found the dolls, and the confession Brian's father made was a repetition of the confession his roommate had made to ''his'' son, Det Neville.&lt;ref&gt;''Echoes'' #4 (Mar 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

Brian is arrested for the girl's murder, and he is ignored when he tries to implicate Neville. Privately, Neville explains that he was present when Brian found the box and had been hoping they could work together. Brian is committed to a mental institution. As he lies strapped to a bed, a vision of his father leans over him promising to help him escape.&lt;ref&gt;''Echoes'' #5 (Apr 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception==
The series received mostly positive reviews. Greg Burgas of [[Comic Book Resources]] praised the series, writing that Fialkov did an excellent job in building tension, and praising Ekedal's black and white art, which he said made the already-dark story feel even more morally ambiguous. Burgas wrote in a December 2010 review: "I really can't recommend ''Echoes'' enough. ... It's an early contender for best mini-series of 2011."&lt;ref name="Burgas"&gt;{{cite web |last=Burgas |first=Greg |title=Another preview review: ''Echoes'' #1&amp;ndash;5 |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] |date=December 29, 2011 |url=http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2010/12/29/another-preview-review-echoes-1-5/ |accessdate=September 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After being nominated for 3 Harvey Awards in 2011, ''Echoes'' was nominated for another four in 2012: Best graphic album previously published, Best continuing or limited series, Best Writer, and Best single issue or story (issue 5).&lt;ref&gt;[http://baltimorecomiccon.com/2012/07/2012-harvey-awards-nominees-announced/ 2012 Harvey Award nominees announced] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120729201523/http://baltimorecomiccon.com/2012/07/2012-harvey-awards-nominees-announced/ |date=2012-07-29 }}, www.baltimorecomiccon.com&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Fleur du Cap Theatre Awards''' are an annual South African theatre awards presentation focusing on professional productions staged in and around [[Cape Town]]. Awards are presented in 20 categories.

==History==
The awards were originally known as the '''Three Leaf Arts Awards''', and the first awards were made in 1965 for the preceding year's productions. The awards were instituted by the United Tobacco Company, who sponsored them until 1977. The Oude Meester Foundation for the Performing Arts, which was formed following the merger of Stellenbosch Farmers' Winery and Distillers Corporation into Distell, then became the sponsor of the awards, renaming them the Fleur du Cap Theatre Awards. Fleur du Cap was originally the name of an old wine farm in [[Somerset West]] and a brand name used by Stellenbosch Farmers' Winery. The Oude Meester Foundation for the Arts was later renamed Distell Arts and Culture.

==Award ceremonies==
The Fleur du Cap Theatre Awards are a [[red carpet]] event held each March. South African entertainers perform at the event and funds generated are donated to development in the performing arts.

The 48th Annual Fleur du Cap Theatre Awards were held at [[Artscape Theatre Centre]] on 17 March 2013. Hosted by comedian [[Alan Committie]] and radio personality Africa Melane, the event featured a range of classical performances in addition to the presentation of awards celebrating theatre excellence. Award winners received [[South African rand|R]]15,000 and a silver medallion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Yiga|first=Eugene|title=South Africa: Winners Announced At Fleur Du Cap Theatre Awards|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201303182622.html|publisher=allAfrica.com|date=18 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Great Railway Journeys''''', originally titled '''''Great Railway Journeys of the World''''', is a recurring series of [[travel documentary|travel documentaries]] produced by [[BBC Television]]. The premise of each programme is that the presenter, typically a well-known figure from the arts or media, would make a journey by train, usually through a country or to a destination to which they had a personal connection. The first series, which used the longer title, was broadcast on [[BBC Two]] in 1980.  After a 14-year hiatus, a further three series were broadcast between 1994 and 1999, using the shorter series title.  Similar series were broadcast in 1983, ''Great Little Railways'', and 2010, ''[[Great British Railway Journeys]]''.

The first series is notable in that it featured the first television travelogue by comedian and comic actor [[Michael Palin]] (''Confessions of a Trainspotter''), who would go on to become as well known for his travel series (such as ''[[Pole to Pole]]'' and ''[[Sahara with Michael Palin|Sahara]]'') as for his comedy.

English musician and sound artist [[Chris Watson (musician)|Chris Watson]] worked as an audio recorder for the fourth episode "Los Mochis to Veracruz" of the fourth season. Having spent between five weeks to a month on the train, Watson used [[field recording]]s of the journey for his 2011 album ''[[El Tren Fantasma]]''.&lt;ref name="Currin 2011"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Currin|first1=Grayson|last2=Masters|first2=Marc|title=Turning the World Into Art|url=http://pitchfork.com/features/the-out-door/8692-field-recording/|work=[[Pitchfork Media|Pitchfork]]|date=21 October 2011|accessdate=16 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pescovitz 2011"&gt;{{cite web|last=Pescovitz|first=David|title=El Tren Fantasma: ambient recording of a ghostly train journey|url=http://boingboing.net/2011/11/04/el-tren-fantasma-ambient-recor.html|work=[[Boing Boing]]|date=4 November 2011|accessdate=16 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Turner 2011"&gt;{{cite web|last=Turner|first=Luke|title=Chris Watson |url=http://thequietus.com/articles/07512-chris-watson-el-tren-fantasma-review|work=[[The Quietus]]|date=2 December 2011|accessdate=16 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Great Little Railways''===
In 1983 the BBC made a further series on rail travel entitled ''Great Little Railways'', this time exclusively featuring [[narrow gauge railways]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1134890/&lt;/ref&gt; This series relied on narrators rather than presenters who appeared on camera. In some cases, the narrator did not partake in the train journey, and simply recited the writing of that episode's producer.

==Great British Railway Journeys==
In January 2010 BBC Two broadcast ''[[Great British Railway Journeys]]'', a documentary with similar basic idea to Great Railway Journeys but with a different format.

Journeys are mainly focused on Great Britain, and is presented by the ex-politician and broadcaster [[Michael Portillo]]. The first series detailed four railway journeys following an 1840 Bradshaw's guide, split into a run of 20 separate episodes. The first series proved a success and a second series followed a year later in January 2011.&lt;ref name="nymr gbrj info 1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nymr.co.uk/2010/06/michael-portillo-films-great-railway-journeys|title=Michael Portillo films Great Railway Journeys|publisher=North Yorkshire Moors Railway|date=10 June 2010|accessdate=19 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A third series followed in January 2012, including five episodes on railways in Ireland.

A fourth series aired in January 2013, also with 25 episodes, with the last five episodes focused again on railways in Ireland. A fifth series following in January 2014 with 20 episodes, making a total airing of 115 episodes across the five series.

==Great Continental Railway Journeys==

From 2012 BBC Two has also broadcast series of ''[[Great Continental Railway Journeys]]'', a documentary with the same idea as Great British Railway Journeys, also presented by Portillo. It detailed railway journeys in mainland Europe, following a 1913 Bradshaw's guide to European rail travel.

==Video and Books==
Although there have been no complete series of ''Great Railway Journeys'' released on [[DVD]], Michael Palin's 1980 and 1994 programmes are available individually (BBCDVD1626) and as part of a box set of his collected travel documentaries, ''The Michael Palin Collection'' (BBCDVD2214).  All seven of the 1980 Series 1 programs, including Palin's Confessions of a Train Spotter, were released in 1986 in cooperation with the BBC on VHS tapes by Pentrex, a California railroad video company.  They are now long out-of-print, but occasionally are offered from online sellers.  The six episodes of 1994's Series 2 were also released on VHS.  Often available in a six-pack of programs, though also out-of-print, they are commonly found for purchase online.

Books have been published to accompany the first three series, with a chapter by each of the presenters on their particular journey:

* Frayn, M. et al. (1981), ''Great Railway Journeys of the World'', [[BBC Books]], hardcover, {{ISBN|0-563-17903-1}}
* Anderson, C. et al. (1994), ''Great Railway Journeys'', [[BBC Books]], hardcover, {{ISBN|0-563-36944-2}}
* Allen, B. et al. (1996), ''More Great Railway Journeys'', [[BBC Books]], hardcover, {{ISBN|0-563-38717-3}}

A similar book was also published on ''Great Little Railways'':

'''Grenadier Models Inc.''' of  [[Springfield Township, Delaware County, Pennsylvania|Springfield, Pennsylvania]] produced lead [[miniature figure (gaming)|miniature figure]]s for [[Wargaming|wargames]] and [[role-playing game]]s with [[fantasy]], [[science fiction]] and heroic themes between 1975 and 1996. Grenadier Models Inc. is best known for their figures for [[TSR, Inc.]]'s ''[[Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]'' game, collectible ''Dragon-of-the-Month'' and ''Giants Club'' figures, and their marketing of paint and miniature sets through traditional retail outlets.

The company began as a basement enterprise, but by 1983 they had grown to a staff of 50 people and had the third highest gross sales in the expanding gaming market.&lt;ref name = GB1.10&gt;''The Grenadier Bulletin'', vol. 1.10, Fall 1983, Scott Slingsby, editor.&lt;/ref&gt; Grenadier's sculptors included [[John Dennett]], [[Janine Bennett]], [[Julie Guthrie]], [[Robert Watts (sculptor)|Robert Watts]], [[Nick Lund]], [[Mark Copplestone]], [[Michael Daley (sculptor)|Michael Daley]], [[Sandra Garrity]], [[Bob Naismith]], [[William Watt (sculptor)|William Watt]] and [[Ian Symonds]]. Grenadier closed its doors in 1996, but many of their products remain in production by companies in the UK, Italy and the United States.

==History==

The company was founded by [[Andrew Chernak]], president and head sculptor, and [[Ray Rubin]], vice president and head artist. Chernak and Rubin had previously partnered in ''Canterbury Pewter Ltd.'', a gift-market sculpting business which they had established in 1972. The duo were not new to historical miniatures. Chernak had previously sculpted for [[Superior Models]] and Rubin was a co-founder of [[Squadron-Rubin Miniatures]]. Grenadier Model's first product was a line of 25mm [[American Revolution]] figures released in anticipation of the 1976 [[United States Bicentennial]]. The company received its name from their first miniature, a grenadier.&lt;ref name = GB1.4&gt;''The Grenadier Bulletin'' vol. 1.4, Spring 1982, Kim Eastland, editor&lt;/ref&gt; In partnership with its European distributor, Grenadier formed ''Grenadier Models Ltd UK'' in 1984. By 1991, the British office became the center of the company's design and development.

Grenadier Models published a product catalog in 1978, 1979, 1982 and annually from 1985 to 1994. Separate European catalogs were published in 1985, 1994, and perhaps other years as well. Their products were discussed in the ''Grenadier Bulletin'', a magazine which also contained games, comics, short-stories, and puzzles. The bulletin was published in several series. The first series contained issues #1 through #18 and were released between the fall of 1981 and late 1987. A new series of four editions was issued in late 1991 and early 1992 in the form of a full-color magazine. A third series, somewhat confusingly labeled "volume II," was produced in the summer of 1993, but appears to have been terminated after a single issue. Grenadier's British offices produced a separate "International edition" of the bulletin called the ''British Grenadier.'' There were at least thirteen issues and it appears to have been produced around 1988. The British offices also published a bi-monthly newsletter ''Warrior: The Newsletter for Fantasy Wargamers'' which supported Grenadier's ''Fantasy Warrior'' game.&lt;ref name = W1&gt;''Warrior'' #1, December 1992/ January 1993, Derek Mugridge, editor.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Warrior'' included thirteen issues published from December 1992 / January 1993 to April / May 1995.&lt;ref name = W13&gt;''Warrior'' #13, April / May 1995, Derek Mugridge, editor.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historical miniatures, 1975-1980===

By the end of 1976, Grenadier had produced miniature soldiers from [[Classical Antiquity]] and the [[American Civil War]], and [[American Old West]] gunfighters. Although they were primarily focused on the well-established market for historical miniatures, their early products included [[list of science fiction themes|science fiction themed]] ''Starsoldiers'' (product codes #S01-19) and ''Space Squadrons: Stellardate 2998'' (#SS01-SS19) [[spaceship]]s, 25mm fantasy figures called ''Wizzards &amp; Warriors'' (W1-60, WS1-5), a ''Special Sets'' line of furniture (#WS01-WS12), and a small selection of 15mm fantasy figures.&lt;ref name = D10&gt;''Dragon Magazine'' #10, 1977&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Konstant&gt;''The Book of Fantasy Miniatures'' by Ed Konstant, [[Little Soldier Games]], 1978&lt;/ref&gt; As the fantasy and science fiction market began to out-pace historical miniatures in 1978, Grenadier released box sets containing select portions of their fantasy, space ships, and gunslinger lines.&lt;ref name = "Gunn"&gt;''The Fantastic Worlds of Grenadier'', Terence Gunn (2003), published by the author&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = JD1-6&gt;''Judge's Guild Dungeoneer Compendium'' #1-6, 1979, page 50&lt;/ref&gt; In 1980 these boxed sets included fantasy game oriented Dungeon Adventure (WW01) and Monsters Sets (WW02), Western Gunfighters (WW03), and Space Squadrons Set (WW04). New figures were crafted for the Gamma World Adventure (WW06), Gamma World Denizens (WW07), Woodland Adventurers (WW08), and Tomb of Spells Sets (WW09).&lt;ref name = "LB2"&gt;"Light Brigade Hobbies Catalog #2, Concord, California, 1980&lt;/ref&gt; The new lines attracted the attention of [[TSR, Inc.]] who produced the [[Gamma World]] and [[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]] role-playing games and began a short, but lucrative partnership between Grenadier and TSR, Inc..

==="Your D &amp; D Figure Company," 1981-1982===

In the fall of 1981 Grenadier Models had begun to refer to itself as "Your D. &amp; D. Figure Company" and began a newsletter ''The Grenadier Bulletin'' to advertise its status as the official producer of miniatures for [[TSR, Inc.]]'s ''[[Advanced Dungeons and Dragons|AD&amp;D]]'' and ''[[Gamma World]]'' [[role-playing games]].&lt;ref name = GB1.1&gt;''The Grenadier Bulletin'' vol. 1.1, Fall 1981, Kim Eastland, editor&lt;/ref&gt; Its first editor [[Kim Eastland]] became an influential author of role-playing games and fiction published by [[TSR, Inc.]]. The ''[[Advanced Dungeons and Dragons|AD&amp;D]]'' lines included [[blister pack]]s of monsters (#101-116), small box sets (#2001-2013), and large box sets (#5001-5004, 5009). A collateral product was [[Action Art]] box sets (#8001-8004) which included paints and painting instructions and served to introduce customers to the hobby. The ''[[Gamma World]]'' role-playing game was supported by a series of [[blister pack]]s (Gxx), a box sets of adventurers (#5005) and post-apocalyptic monsters (#5006). Grenadier also produced figures (SN1-4) for [[TSR, Inc.|TSR]]'s ''[[Snit's Revenge]]'' board game.&lt;ref name = G1982&gt;''Grenadier's Consumer Catalogue'' 1982&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 1982 Grenadier Models and [[TSR, Inc.]] ended their business relationship.&lt;ref name="Kyngdoms"&gt;{{cite web | last = Sacco | first = Ciro Alessandro | title = The Ultimate Interview with Gary Gygax | work = thekyngdoms.com | url = http://www.thekyngdoms.com/forums/viewtopic.php?t=37 | accessdate = 2008-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = GB1.6&gt;''The Grenadier Bulletin'', vol. 1.6, Winter 1982, Scott Slingsby, editor.&lt;/ref&gt; The point of contention was Grenadier's plans to produce figures for other game companies. Grenadier later described the separation as "a bold decision... in order to provide players of all fantasy games with a broader range of quality fantasy miniatures".&lt;ref name = GB1.16&gt;''The Grenadier Bulletin'', vol. 1.16, Don Wellman, editor.&lt;/ref&gt; Since many of Chernak's sculptures predated TSR, Inc.'s artwork, Grenadier Models retained the rights to many of their sculptures and re-released choice figures in the ''Dragon Lords'' (#2001-2013, 5001-5004), ''Fantasy Lords'' (#6001-6005, 101-112), and [[Action Art]] (#8003, 8004) lines.&lt;ref name = Gunn/&gt; There appear to have been continued issues with the reuse of the sculpts which might have resembled images which TSR, Inc. considered trademarked. Parts of some sets (#2010-2012, 8003, 8004) were replaced with new sculpts.&lt;ref name = GB1.8&gt;''The Grenadier Bulletin'', vol. 1.8, Summer 1983, Scott Slingsby, editor&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982 and 1983 Grenadier conducted a ''Wizard's Gold Contest'' in which they placed gold-plated castings within random boxes of figures. The box also included a certificate for a drawing. The grand prize for 1982 was a one-half ounce of gold for the purchaser of the box set and the store which sold it. The 1983 certificates awarded gift certificates and were placed in ''6001 - Dragons of the Emerald Idol'' and ''6002 - Skeleton-Raiders of the Undead'' box sets.&lt;ref name = GB1.8/&gt; However, collectors have reported gold-plated figures from other contemporaneous sets.

==="Collect and Paint," 1983-1990===

As Grenadier parted ways with [[TSR, Inc.]] they continued to reach out to the burgeoning adventure gaming market. In 1983 they became the official producer of miniatures for [[Chaosium]]'s ''[[Call of Cthulhu (role-playing game)|Call of Cthulhu]]'' (#6501, 6502), and [[Game Designers' Workshop]]'s ''[[Traveller (role-playing game)|Traveller]]'' (#1001-1003). In 1983 Grenadier announced an agreement to produce miniatures for FASA's ''Star Trek'' role playing game, but the figures were produced by [[Ral Partha Enterprises, Inc.]], [[RAFM]] in 1985, and [[Rawcliffe Pewter]] from 1989 to 1999.&lt;ref name="GB1.6"/&gt; At that same time the owners of Grenadier Models spun off a subsidiary called ''Pinnacle Products'' with an orientation toward mainstream retail outlets. They produced ''The Dark Crystal Adventure Collection'' which included two boxed sets (#9001, 9002, note reuse of product code) containing paints and miniatures of the characters and furniture in the December 1982 movie ''[[The Dark Crystal]]''. Other ''Pinnacle Products'' merchandise included the ''Paint and Collect Series'' consisting of ''2201 - Dinosaurs'', ''2202 - Fantasy Lords'', ''2203 - Fantasy Monsters'', and ''2204 - G.I. Assault Team''.&lt;ref name = GB1.9/&gt; In early 1983 Grenadier added four ''Paint and Playset''s (#9101-9104) to coincide with [[Mattel]]'s ''[[Masters of the Universe]]'' cartoon and 1/285 scale tanks and artillery for [[Steve Jackson Games]]' ''[[Ogre]]'' (#6101, 6110-6115, 6118, 6122) and 1/180 scale vehicles ''[[Car Wars]]'' '' Autoduel'' (#6201-6210) games.&lt;ref name = GB1.8/&gt; In October 1983 Grenadier added a line of ''Secret Agents'' (#3001, 3002).&lt;ref name = GB1.10/&gt;

As fantasy and science fiction gaming outpaced traditional wargames and modeling, Grenadier discontinued many of their historical period figures. Lines of 54mm scale figures (#5401-5409) featuring personages like "5401- Jesus of Nazareth," and a 77mm series of figures (#9001-9003, 9006) based on the calendar art of [[Boris Vallejo]].&lt;ref name = G1982/&gt; were dropped in 1983.&lt;ref name = GB1.9&gt;''The Grenadier Bulletin'', vol. 1.9, Fall 1983, Scott Slingsby, editor.&lt;/ref&gt;

Between March 1984 and February 1985 Grenadier released twelve monthly installments in the popular ''Dragon-of-the-Month'' series. Each box set included a variety of fantasy [[dragon]], a jeweled base, and a portion of a map of the mystical land the dragons inhabited. Those who collected all twelve dragons were eligible to receive an additional dragon figure. Other 1984 introductions included the ''Masterpiece Editions'' ''5501 - War Mammoth of the Undead Legion'', ''5501 - Death Dragon'', futuristic war machines called ''Warbots'' (#4501, 4502), and miniatures for [[Mayfair Games]]'s ''[[Champions (role-playing game)|Champions]]'' (#4001, 4002). Grenadier also released four gaming scenarios: ''The Horrible Secret Of Monhegan Island'' by Gary Pilkington for [[Call of Cthulhu (role-playing game)|Call of Cthulhu]], ''Cloudland'' by Tony Fiorito for ''[[Tunnels and Trolls]]'' or ''[[Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]'', ''Raid on Rajallapor'' by Gary Pilkington for Blades' ''[[Mercenaries, Spies and Private Eyes]]'', and ''Disappearance on Aramat'' by Gary Pilkington for [[Game Designers' Workshop]]'s ''[[Traveller (role-playing game)|Traveller]]''.&lt;ref name = GB1.12&gt;''The Grenadier Bulletin'', vol. 1.12, Spring 1984, Scott Slingsby, editor.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = GB1.13&gt;''The Grenadier Bulletin'', vol. 1.13, Fall 1984, Don Wellman, editor.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = GB1.14&gt;''The Grenadier Bulletin'', vol. 1.14, January 1985, Don Wellman, editor.&lt;/ref&gt;

Grenadier celebrated its 10th anniversary by adding 10,000 commemorative [[Paladin]] figures to boxes of ''6007 - Fantasy Lords Dungeon Raiders''.&lt;ref name = GB1.14/&gt; The "Dragon-of-the-Month" products proved very popular and Grenadier released a second series of dragons in March 1985, a line of large humanoids which they called "The Giant's Club". The first installment was ''3501 - Fire Giant,'' and the "Monster Manuscript" which included dungeon creatures organized in alphabetical order. Also in 1985 Grenadier released the official miniatures for [[Iron Crown Enterprises|I.C.E.]]'s ''[[Middle-earth Role Playing|Middle-earth]]'' in the world of [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Lord Of The Rings]]'', a line of 15mm soldiers for [[Game Designers' Workshop]]'s ''[[Twilight 2000]]'' skirmish game which takes place in a world where the [[Cold War]] was resolved with arms, superheroes for [[Hero Games]]' ''[[Champions (role-playing game)|Champions]]'', [[Pacesetter Ltd|Pacesetter]]'s ''[[Chill (role-playing game)|Chill]]'', [[Mayfair Games]]' ''[[D.C. Heroes]]'', and [[West End Games]]' ''[[Paranoia (role-playing game)|Paranoia]]'' role-playing games.&lt;ref name = GB1.16/&gt;&lt;ref name = GB1.15&gt;''The Grenadier Bulletin'', vol. 1.15, March 1985, Don Wellman, editor&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = GB1.17&gt;''The Grenadier Bulletin'' vol. 1.17, Summer 1985, Don Wellman, editor.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = G1987&gt;''Grenadier Models Inc. 1987 Photographic Compendium.''&lt;/ref&gt;

Grenadier signed on [[Julie Guthrie]] in 1987 to sculpt their first signature line ''Julie Guthrie's Fantasy Personalities''.&lt;ref name = GB1.18&gt;''The Grenadier Bulletin'', Fall 1987, Don Wellman, editor.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1988 Grenadier became the manufacturer of miniatures for [[West End Games]]' role-playing system, ''[[Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game|Star Wars]]''. This miniatures series was based upon the first three George Lucas films, and included representations of the main characters, Rebel troops, droids, villains, storm troopers, and vehicles. In 1989 Grenadier released the first ''[[Shadowrun]]'' miniatures for [[FASA Corporation|FASA]]'s role-playing game.&lt;ref name = Gunn/&gt;

===Grenadier Models U.K., 1991-1994===

Grenadier models UK Ltd was created in 1984. Bob Watts approached Roger Higgins of [[Games of Liverpool]], Grenadier's British distributor, to cast Grenadier's products for the European market. Higgins recruited his Import and Wholesale Manager, Doug Cowie and Mal Green to set up and run ''Grenadier Models UK''. Casting equipment was set up above their [[Birkenhead]] offices and they learned the trade of casting by trial and error. Public grants through the Welsh Development Agency assisted a move to northern Wales. By 1991 Grenadier had begun selling Nick Lund's ''Fantasy Warriors: a game of fantasy battles'' a boxed game which included 102 plastic figures sculpted by [[Mark Copplestone]] with later additions by other sculptors. Branches of the company were established in Auckland, New Zealand and Deeside, Clwyd, Wales to support British and Australian customers, remove the costs of international shipping, and connect with Grenadier's European sculptors. The company in Wales provided a chance for Grenadier to tap into the growing market for larger scale (30&amp;nbsp;mm) miniatures in which UK designers invoked styles from European fantasy and science fiction. Grenadier's office in Wales became the center of the company's product design and British artists Mark Copplestone, [[Bob Naismith]], and Nick Lund became the company's chief sculptors.&lt;ref name = G1991&gt;''Grenadier Models Inc. 1991 Catalogue&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pennsylvania office provided traditional themes from fantasy and history. Andy Chernak revived his 1978 ''Western Gunfighters'' boxed set (#4901) and a line of existing figures entitled ''Fantasy Classics'', ''Nightmares'', and ''The Best of Julie Guthrie'' boxed set (#7001). Julie Guthrie introduced the ''Lords of Light and Decay'' boxes sets (#8801, 8802), a line of ''Fantasy Personalities II'', and added the ''Cyberpunk'' line. Janine Bennett introduced a range of ''Amazons'' (#3312) which were suitable for use with ''Fantasy Warriors''.&lt;ref name = GBN.3&gt;''The Grenadier Bulletin'', new series #3, Spring 1991, [[Matt Forbeck]] editor&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = GBN.4&gt;''The Grenadier Bulletin'', new series #4, Summer 1992, Matt Forbeck editor&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992 Grenadier Models underwent a period of revitalization. The company's founders Andrew Chernak and Ray Rubin returned to their creative responsibilities.&lt;ref name = G1993&gt;''Grenadier Models 1993 Catalog'', Grenadier Models Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; Kim Eastland returned to Grenadier Models from TSR, Inc.&lt;ref name = G1987/&gt;&lt;ref name = GB2.1&gt;''The Grenadier Bulletin'', vol. 2.1, Summer 1993, Kim Eastland, editor&lt;/ref&gt; The return to the early structure of the company may have been prompted by the loss of their partnerships with game manufacturers. By the beginning of 1993, their licensed figures had dwindled to the point that they only produced Andrew Chernak and Sandra Garrity's sculptures for [[R. Talisorian Games]]' ''[[Cyberpunk]].''&lt;ref name = G1993/&gt;

The resurgence of the Pennsylvania offices was short-lived, and Nick Lund's ''Fantasy Warriors'' (#5000) was the center piece of the 1993 catalog.&lt;ref name = G1993/&gt;  A similar space-themed game called ''Future Warriors'' (#1501-1509, 1701) was released later that same year.&lt;ref name = GB2.1/&gt; Fantasy war gamers were targeted with the ''Lost Lands'' boxed sets of 25mm scale miniatures (#3001-3006), ''Fantasy Warriors'' artillery pieces and battlefield accessories (#9201-9203, 402-406) and a 15mm ''Warlords'' (#1801-1818) line of military units.&lt;ref name = GB2.1/&gt; The fantasy role-playing market was addressed by Julie Guthrie's large signature series (#801-899, 701-724, 7001, 7002, 8101-8145), a ''Fantasy Legends'' line (#3101-3128) consisting of existing models and new sculpts by William Watt, Sandra Garrity, and Julie Guthrie.&lt;ref name = G1993/&gt; Also in 1993 Grenadier Models released ''Dragon Lords the Game'' (#5700-5711) a 6mm scale skirmish game featuring dragon riders, and 25mm plastic [[space marine]]s called ''Space Rangers'' (#87003).&lt;ref name = GB2.1/&gt;

Grenadier Models' figures were initially cast in an alloy of lead and tin, but in 1993 New York legislators nearly passed a public health bill barring the use of lead in toys and games.&lt;ref name = D192&gt;"Through the Looking Glass" by Robert Bigalow, Dragon #192, April 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the additional cost, numerous manufacturers anticipated parental concerns, similar legislation in other states, their own workplace safety, and they began using white metal alloys. Grenadier began converting its lines to a non-lead alloy they called ''Luminite'' in the winter of 1992.&lt;ref name = GB2.1/&gt; The use of non-lead alloy marks a clear benchmark for dating old figures. In time, New York Governor [[Mario Cuomo]] relented to hobbyists' concerns and exempted miniatures from the state's Public Health Law.&lt;ref name = NY2&gt;"Through the Looking Glass" by Robert Bigalow, Dragon #205, May 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Grenadier Models did not return to producing in lead.

The product lines for 1994 were a mix of European and American designs. Mark Copplestone and Bob Naismith introduced new sculpts for the ''Fantasy Warriors'' game, and Nick Lund and Doug Cowie authored ''Fantasy Warriors Companion'' an expansion of the rules. Mike Daley began a series of large scale ''Master Wizards'' (#4401, 4402). William Watt added a ''Battle Giant'' (#2701) to the ''Special Edition'' line, and a signature line of ''William Watt's Dragons'' (#2901, 2902).

===Post Script===

At [[Gen Con]] in August 1996 it was revealed that the molds and master sculpts of Grenadier Models Inc. had been purchased by [[Stratelibri]], their long-time distributor in [[Milan, Italy]]. The rights have since passed to [[Mirliton S.G.]] who continues to produce many of the figures from Grenadier's last years in business. Some of Grenadier's artists retained the right to their work. In 2001 [[Mega Miniatures]] purchased the production rights to 180 of the ''Julie Guthrie's Grenadier Personalities''. Those 180 Grenadier Personalities were sold to [[Center Stage Miniatures]] in the fall of 2012. The production of all UK designed and sculpted miniatures are currently licensed to [[em4miniatures]] of [[Rustington]], [[West Sussex]], [[England]] by the holder of those rights.

Since the sale of Grenadier Model's assets, Andrew Chernak has taken his sculpting to the other extreme and now creates monumental scale bronzes commemorating fallen soldiers. He is also available for lectures on military history and art .&lt;ref name = Chernak&gt;''Andrew L.Chernak Sculptures Bronze Statues'', http://www.andrewchernak.com/ accessed July 4, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Happy talk''', also called '''banter''', is the additional and often meaningless commentary interspersed into [[television news]] programs by [[news anchor]]s and others on [[set construction|set]].  It may consist of simple [[joke]]s or simply a modified wording in asking a question of another reporter.  For instance, instead of a simple handoff to a [[sports]]caster, an anchor might say, "So, Erin, what the heck happened out on that field today?  Is our team going down the tubes?" "Happy talk" may also refer to a format of news which encourages such commentary.  

Happy talk has been derided by some who prefer a more "traditional" and staid newscast, though it has been happening in some places since the early days of [[broadcasting]].  Many marketing experts believe that it increases viewership {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}, and can therefore provide a financial boost to a local station, but it can also backfire&amp;mdash;some newscasters are not comfortable with happy talk and fail in their attempts to do it, and some anchor teams may not have the chemistry or working relationship to be able to pull it off believably.

Happy Talk was created by [[Al Primo]], who also created the ''[[Eyewitness News]]'' format.&lt;ref name=mdm&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Michael D. Murray]] |title=Encyclopedia of television news |year=1999 |publisher=[[Greenwood Publishing Group]] |page=197, parag. 6 |quote=Meanwhile, however, [[Al Primo |Primo]] and [[ABC News |ABC]] were criticized for encouraging informal interactions between anchors and reporters. This component of ''[[Eyewitness News]]'' was known as "happy talk". Nevertheless, Primo's newscasts were so popular with viewers that they almost instantly ....| url= https://books.google.com/books?id=J3fhcUnCC1AC&amp;pg=PA197 |isbn=1-57356-108-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Happy Talk was satirized by the [[Firesign Theater]] as the "Channel 6 Where It's Happy" news team of Harold Hiphugger and Ray Hamberger (''am-bur-ZHER'') in their 1974 album ''[[Everything You Know Is Wrong]]''.

==Online==
In the popular book on [[web usability]], ''[[Don't Make Me Think]]'', Steve Krug identifies a kind of writing where website authors eagerly share unnecessary information about their own website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000163.html|title=Happy Talk Must Die|publisher=|accessdate=17 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Happy talk consists of things such as:
* welcoming messages
* details of the process of creating the website such as how long it took
* information about the design of the website such as rationale
* superfluous instructional advice

Krug says that those who write happy talk do so under the misconception that visitors to the site will find it interesting, but visitors actually want to save time and get things done.

'''Hatchimals''' is a line of robotic toys produced by [[Spin Master]].
== Overview ==
Hatchimals are electronic birds that you can nuture and can hatch from a plastic egg.

Later, in 2017, Hatchimals CollEGGtibles, collectible figurines that you can take out of smaller eggs, was released.

== History ==
It began in 2013, where Spin Master's head of robotic creations [[James Bartin]] explained that his team hated the popularity of [[unboxing]] videos on [[YouTube]], and envisioned a concept for a toy that could "unbox" itself.&lt;ref name="gandm-hatchimals"/&gt; This idea evolved into a concept for a [[robotic]] creature that would hatch itself from an egg, necessitating the design of a mechanism for the hatching, and a material for the egg itself. Hatchimals was officially launched on October 7, 2016, backed by advertising on television and digital platforms, such as [[social networking service]]s.&lt;ref name="gandm-hatchimals"&gt;{{cite web|title=How a Toronto company invented this year's hottest toy: Hatchimals|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/toronto/how-a-toronto-toy-company-created-hatchimals-and-why-you-cant-find-them/article32932641/|website=The Globe and Mail|accessdate=7 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nyt-craze"/&gt;

== Demand ==
Demand for Hatchimals has been extremely high, which have led to them being designated as the "hottest" toy of the 2016 [[Economics of Christmas|Christmas shopping season]]; in late-October 2016, Hatchimals occupied multiple spots on [[NPD Group]]'s top ten list of best-selling toys in the United States, including first, second, sixth, and ninth place. The firm compared the phenomenon to those surrounding [[Cabbage Patch Kids]] and [[Tickle Me Elmo]]&lt;ref name="gandm-hatchimals"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nyt-craze"/&gt;''. [[The New York Times]]'' and ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' documented the organization of raffles and waiting lists for the toys, and sellers on websites such as [[Amazon.com]] and [[eBay]] selling Hatchimals at over three times their suggested retail price of US$60, if not higher.&lt;ref name="nyt-craze"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Hunt for Hatchimals, the Elusive Toy of the Holiday Season|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/05/well/family/the-hunt-for-hatchimals-the-elusive-toy-of-the-holiday-season.html?_r=0|website=The New York Times|accessdate=7 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spin Master was caught off-guard by the unexpected demand; the company originally stated that the toy would appeal primarily to girls aged 6 to 8, but Hatchimals ultimately became popular among boys and older youth audiences as well.&lt;ref name="gandm-hatchimals"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nyt-craze"/&gt; The company attempted to address the supply issues by having its remaining stock from China delivered via air freight instead of by ship, but stated that there may not be new stock of Hatchimals until 2017. However, Martin added that the company planned to introduce new species and features to the Hatchimals line, and asked customers to be patient. A California mother sued Spin Master for an egg not hatching because the Hatchimal's batteries were dead.&lt;ref name="gandm-hatchimals"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nyt-craze"/&gt;

It was created in December 2002 and it is mostly made up of young Mexicans, lovers of Asian arts and particularly those of [[Indonesia]]. Some of its members have had the opportunity to study directly in the islands of [[Java]] and [[Bali]] through the Darmasiswa Scholarship program offered by the Indonesian government.

==Origins==
Its foundation dates back to the Spring of 2002, when its founder, [[Fitra Ismu Kusumo]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title=Kehidupan Umat Muslim di Meksiko |episode-link= |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6pxlXbdUsM |series=Muslim Travelers |first=Febby |last=Purnamasari |network=[[NET.]] TV |station= |date=June 11, 2016  |minutes=01:28-11:12 |language=Indonesian }}&lt;/ref&gt; had just arrived in Mexico. Seeing that the [[gamelan]] of the Indonesian Embassy was not used as such, but was merely a decorative object on display, along with former Darmasiswas Miguel Piñeda and Carolina Malgarego decided to seize the opportunity and use the [[Javanese people|Javanese]] slendro owned by the Embassy.

During the Summer of that year, other Darmasiswa grantees returned from Indonesia: Ilse Peralta and Shawn Callahan (American). Shawn, Fitra, Miguel, Carolina and Ilse had known each other since 2000 while in Indonesia. Ilse Peralta returns to Mexico with the idea of forming an Indonesian art and culture group which she calls "Majapahit"&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last=Pramudyo | first=Hendrar | year=2005 | title=Dari Jalan Trunojoyo 3 ke Calle Julio Verne 27 | publisher  =KBRI Mexico City | publication-place =Mexico City | page=56 | &lt;!-- accessdate =December 6, 2017| --&gt;language=Indonesian }}&lt;/ref&gt;, based on her [[Balinese dance]] studies; while Fitra Ismu keeps the concept of gamelan and making use of the gamelan at the Embassy, he invites the music schools in Mexico City(Escuela Nacional de Música,Escuela Superior de Música and [[Conservatorio Nacional de Música (Mexico)]], extending this invitation to their students to learn how to play the gamelan together as a group. At that time, Emilio Esteban, Zianya Nandayapa, Iván Flores Morán,Jorge Vazquez, Olinka Flores, Yarandari and other young people joined to learn how to play the gamelan.
In that same Summer of 2002, the gamelan group Indra Swara was founded at the Indonesian Embassy in Mexico

==Trajectory==
[[File: Gamelan indra swara.jpg |250px|thumb|[[Gamelan]] group Indra Swara in Mexico]]
The main objective of the group is to provide a space to publicize and promote, in Mexico and its surroundings, the ancient art and culture of Indonesia through a musical group of gamelan orchestra&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title=Indonesia, su música y su cultura |episode-link= |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rnxH_QlYZ0 |access-date=January 29, 2016 |series=Mision Mundial |series-link= |first=Gerardo |last=Yong |network=http://astl.tv/ |station= |date= |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title=Sabores y Cultura de Indonesia |episode-link= |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAfxEbNV4FA |access-date=November 17, 2017 |series=Mision Mundial |series-link= |first=Gerardo |last=Yong |network=http://astl.tv/ |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;. It isn’t until 2005 that the group manages to get its own gamelan. Since March 2003 Fitra Ismu manages to raise enough money for the purchase of a gamelan and its freight from Java Indonesia to [[Mexico City]]. This is achieved, of course, with the administrative support of the Indonesian Embassy in [[Mexico]], making use of the facilities available to its diplomatic corps.
[[File: Gamelan indra swara awal.jpg |250px|thumb|[[Gamelan]] group Indra Swara in Mexico 2003]]
In February 2007 under the direction of Emilio Esteban, the group managed to release its first album&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = El Sabor del Dorado | newspaper =  | publication-place = Mexico city | date   = February 23, 2007 | url    = https://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/indra-swara/966411512= }}&lt;/ref&gt;, which was considered a great achievement for the group. Likewise, performances including both music and sendra tari (theater with gamelan and traditional dance) were staged with the unconditional support of Camilo García and Katherine Ziggler (Kate Asmara), both former Darmasiswas for the period 2004-2008.

Between the winter of 2009 and the spring of 2011, under the coordination of Fitra Ismu, the Javanese gamelan instruments were taught in a music school; this was done at the Centro Cultural Ollin Yoliztli, and the opportunity was provided by one of the Center's directors, Mr. Francisco Becerra Maza. Those who taught the gamelan classes were Esteban Gonzales, Huitzilin Sanchez and Fitra Ismu, borrowing the Surakartan style pelog slendro Javanese gamelan from the Indonesian embassy in Mexico.The gamelan teaching program at this school had to be stopped due to lack of sponsor.

Indra Swara has benefited from the advice of two dance and music teachers: Balinese dancer and ethnomusicologist Bapak I Nyoman Wenten and Javanese ethnomusicologist Bapak Joko Walujo, both masters of Indonesian art at the [[California Institute of the Arts]] (CALARTS) in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]]. In 2003, 2005 and 2014 they visited Mexico to teach short courses and give presentations. Likewise, [[Jody Diamond]], composer and artist in residence at [[Harvard University]] has visited Mexico to give gamelan courses. As regards traditional dance, the group has had the advice of teacher Irawati Durban Ardjo, specialist in the Sundanese style (West Java), who visited Mexico in 2005&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last=Pramudyo | first=Hendrar | year=2004 | title=50 tahun Hubungan Diplomatik Indonesia-Meksiko | publisher  =Indonesian Embassy Mexico City | publication-place =Mexico City | page= 83|&lt;!-- accessdate = December 6, 2017 | --&gt;language=Indonesian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | title = Primer Festival de Música Tradicional: “Entre ayer y hoy” | newspaper = [[Diario de Yucatán]] | publication-place = Merida |date   = July 22, 2016  | page = Cultura | url = http://yucatan.com.mx/merida/gobierno-merida/primer-festival-musica-tradicional-ayer-hoy |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

In 2014 the Indra Swara Group forms a new division that includes its [[gamelan degung]] set which it calls Gamelan Barudak, since a team member, Daniel Milán&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last  = Nerv | first = Shinji | author-link =  | title = Realizan en Oaxaca Taller sobre Danzas de Paz | newspaper = Ciudadania-Express | publication-place = Oaxaca | volume =  | issue  =  | date   = August 11, 2017  | page   = Cultura | url    = http://ciudadania-express.com/2017/08/11/realizan-en-oaxaca-taller-sobre-danzas-de-paz/ |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;, returns to Mexico in 2014 after almost 5 years of learning the art of gamelan degung in West Java, Indonesia. In that same year, the first Indonesian shadow puppet play ([[wayang kulit]]) was also presented and the special division for presenting puppet plays was created&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last  =  | first =  | author-link =  | title = Diversidad de actividades para celebrar a los niños en su día | website = protocolo.com.mx | publication-place = Mexico City | volume =  | issue  =  | date   = April 27, 2017  | page   = Cultura | url    = http://www.protocolo.com.mx/cultura/diversidad-de-actividades-para-celebrar-a-los-ninos-en-su-dia/ |language=Spanish }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last  = Morales | first = Fransisco | title = Interpretan títeres el 'Ramayana' | newspaper = [[Reforma]]| publication-place = Mexico City  | date   = November 28, 2014  | page   = Cultura | url    = http://www.reforma.com/aplicacioneslibre/preacceso/articulo/default.aspx?id=404666&amp;sc=749&amp;urlredirect=http://www.reforma.com/aplicaciones/articulo/default.aspx?id=404666&amp;sc=749 |language=Spanish }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last  =  | first = | author-link =  | title = Explica especialista técnicas de títeres de sombra de Indonesia | newspaper = [[Notimex]]| publication-place = Ciudad de Mexico | volume =  | issue  =  | date   = July 19, 2014  | page   = minuto a minuto| url    = http://www.periodicoenfoque.com.mx/2014/07/explica-especialista-tecnicas-de-titeres-de-sombra-de-indonesia/ |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Since then, Indra Swara has been expanding, and in addition to promoting the gamelan / music and dance (which had been doing before), also begins to promote the art of Indonesian puppets&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title=Arte de Titeres en Indonesia |episode-link= |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IajiPtCqmg |access-date=May 25, 2017 |series=Mision Mundial |series-link= |first=Gerardo |last=Yong |network=http://astl.tv/|station= |date= |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

In 2015 the Mexican percussionist group [[Tambuco]], with 4 [[Grammy Award]] nominations, borrowed the gamelan from Indra Swara (its [[degung]] Barudak gamelan ensemble) to present the work of [[Lou Harrison]] "Threnody for [[Carlos Chávez]]" within the framework of the Historic Center Festival in Mexico City during the Spring of 2015, for the same reason that at that time it was the only set of gamelan degung in Latin America.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last  = Aris | first = Satrio | title = Di Meksiko Gamelan Dimainkan oleh Seniman ‘Grammy Award’ | website = aktual.com | publication-place = Jakarta | date   = April 13, 2015  | page   = Jalan Jalan | url    = http://www.aktual.com/di-meksiko-gamelan-dimainkan-oleh-seniman-grammy-award/ |language=Indonesian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last  = Kurnaeti | first = Eti | author-link =  | title = Wayang Kulit Ramaikan Negeri Taco | website = OkeZone.com | publication-place = Jakarta | volume =  | issue  =  | date   = December 15, 2015  | page   = Travel | url    = https://lifestyle.okezone.com/read/2015/12/15/406/1267812/wayang-kulit-ramaikan-negeri-taco |language=Indonesian }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last  =  | first =  | author-link =  | title = Pagelaran Wayang Kulit dan Gamelan di Universitas Terbesar di Amerika Latin | website = mediatajam.com | publication-place = Jakarta | volume =  | issue  =  | date   = October 13, 2016  | page   = Budaya | url    = http://mediatajam.com/pagelaran-wayang-kulit-dan-gamelan-di-universitas-terbesar-di-amerika-latin |language=Indonesian }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last  = | first =  | author-link = | title = Títeres de sombra de Indonesia | website = MuseosdeMexico.com | publication-place = Mexico City | volume =  | issue  =  | date   = December 1, 2017  | page   = eventos | url    = https://www.museosdemexico.com/evento/titeres-de-sombra-de-indonesia_4284.html |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last  =  | first =  | author-link =  | title = Breves Culturales | newspaper = [[20 minutos]]| publication-place = Mexico City | volume = | issue  =  | date   = July 11, 2014  | page   = Noticias de Artes | url    = https://www.20minutos.com.mx/noticia/b173852/breves-culturales/ |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Likewise, a very famous jazz group from Indonesia, [[Krakatau]], during its visit to participate in the 2008 [[Festival Internacional Cervantino]] in [[Guanajuato]], through its director, Dwiki Dharmawan, gave Indra Swara several traditional Indonesian instruments. In 2012 the group of musicians from the [[Mangkunegaran Palace]] court also visited Mexico for their participation in the 2012 [[Cervantino Festival]] and the musicians presented Indra Swara with various shadow puppets, fabrics and equipment for shadow puppet presentations ([[Wayang kulit]])&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last  = Rachmawati | first = Yunita | title = Krakatau Band Rayakan 25 Tahun di Mexico | website = KapanLagi.com | publication-place = Jakarta | date   = October 20, 2008  | page   = Jalan Jalan | url    = https://musik.kapanlagi.com/berita/krakatau-band-rayakan-25-tahun-di-mexico-n92asvt.html |language=Indonesian}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In 2003, Fitra Ismu began working at the Indonesian Embassy in Mexico as an assistant to the cultural attaché of that diplomatic corps, which greatly facilitated the movement of the group especially to seek and hold events with the support of the Embassy as part of the country's cultural promotion strategy in Mexico. In 2004 Emilio Esteban returned from Indonesia (after having left with the Darmasiswa scholarship program) and in 2005 the gamelan pelog instruments belonging to the group arrived from Indonesia. A regeneration of the group took place, in which Emilio Esteban became director of the group (2005-2013) and Fitra Ismu remained as founder and, using his position in the Embassy (where he worked until 2012) he also serves as promoter for the group (from 2005 to date).

==Divisions and group conformation==
Indra swara originated with a Javanese slendro Javanese  gamelan set from Indonesia, and since 2002 and over time it has been acquiring more materials from Indonesia with the main idea of promoting Indonesia in Mexico and amongst Spanish speakers. Since its foundation, Indra Swara has acquired several traditional Indonesian instruments such as [[Hasapi]], gendang melayu/[[Kendang]], various types of flutes/[[suling]], [[Rebab]], [[Kacapi]] and some [[Sasando]]. Currently, the divisions (conformation) of the group are: 
* the [[Pelog]] Javanese Nyi Asep Mangsa gamelan&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Indra Swara presenta la música y la cultura de Indonesia en Radio UNAM  | website = saladeprensacdc.unam.mx | publication-place = Mexico City | volume =  | issue  =  | date   = May 21, 2012  | page   = Cultura | url    = http://www.saladeprensacdc.unam.mx/index.php/radio-unam/item/1292-indra-swara-presenta-la-musica-y-la-cultura-de-indonesia-en-radio-unam |language=Spanish }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Musica Festival Interseccion | newspaper = [[UNAM Radio]]| publication-place = Mexico City  | date   = February 16, 2018  | page   = Cultura | url    = http://www.radio.unam.mx/event/musica-transmitida-festival-intersecciones-3/ |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and since 2014, the division of

[[File:Wayang golek indra swara.jpg|thumb||300px|[[Wayang golek]] Indra Swara in Spanish language, Feria Internacional del Libro Infantil y Juvenil 2017]]
Indra Swara started to acquire puppets since 2007, and by 2010 it was possible for them to buy a box of Javanese shadow puppets containing 180 characters; although this box is still in Indonesia due to lack of funds to bring it to Mexico&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last  = Suruni | first = Andi   | title = Ada Pameran Wayang di Gedung Tertinggi di Meksiko | newspaper = [[Detik.com]] | publication-place = Jakarta | date   = November 12, 2012 | url    = https://news.detik.com/berita/2088846/ada-pameran-wayang-di-gedung-tertinggi-di-meksiko?n992204fksberita= |language=Indonesian }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

This strategy has been effective because since 2014 Mexicans have had the opportunity to learn more about Indonesia through these puppet shows&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last  =  | first =  | author-link =  | title = Explican Tecnicas de Titeres de Sombras | website = DiariodePalenque.com.mx | publication-place = Mexico City| volume = Notimex | issue  =  | date   = July 17, 2014  | page   = Arte y Cultura| url    = http://www.diariodepalenque.com.mx/2014/07/explican-tecnicas-de-titeres-de-sombra/ |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and in addition, this has given the group more opportunities to present themselves in front of the public.

One of the efforts of the Indra Swara group to promote the Indonesian art of puppetry has been through the donation&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last  = Barrera | first = Juan Manuel | title = El Museo de Historia de Titere festejara sus cinco años | newspaper = [[El Universal (Mexico City)|El Universal]] | publication-place = Mexico City | date   = March 3, 2016  | page   = Cultura | url    = http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/articulo/cultura/2016/03/3/el-museo-de-la-historia-del-titere-festejara-sus-cinco-anos |language=Spanish }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title=Festejan 5to.

In addition, Fitra Ismu, during the period 2005-2007, had already served as facilitator for donations made by the Indonesian Embassy in Mexico to several institutions in Mexico, including the National Museum of Cultures in Mexico City.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last  = Miranda | first = Elizabeth  | title = Wayang Golek Caracol Dorado| newspaper = Feria Internacional del Libro Infantil y Juvenil 2017 | publication-place = Mexico City | date   = November 17, 2017  | url    = http://filij.cultura.gob.mx/calendario/parque-bicentenario/17-11-2017/evento/6044/ |language=Spanish }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Books==
The following books (written by Fitra Ismu using his own versions of the traditional stories) are used as material that serves as the basis for the group’s puppet shows or storytelling performances:

* La Bufanda Roja-Cuentos Folkloricos de Indonesia (Folkloric Tales of Indonesia)&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last  = Kurnaeti | first = Eti| title = Buku Dongeng Nusantara Meriahkan Festival Buku Anak Terbesar di Meksiko | website = Hitput.com | publication-place = Jakarta | date   = November 19, 2017 | url    = http://hitput.com/buku-dongeng-nusantara-meriahkan-festival-buku-anak-terbesar-di-meksiko/ |language=Indonesian }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last  =Miranda  | first =Elizabeth | title = La bufanda roja.

The '''Japan Amateur Radio League''' ('''JARL''') (in [[Japanese language|Japanese]], '''日本アマチュア無線連盟''') is a national [[non-profit organization]] for [[amateur radio]] enthusiasts in [[Japan]].   JARL was founded in 1926 by Japanese radio communication enthusiasts whose stated aim was to promote the development and utilization of radio wave technology as a medium.  JARL says its current membership comprises the largest number of radio stations in the world, and credits its growth to "the devoted efforts of pioneering hams, who took the history of amateur radio to heart and guided it through the changing and challenging winds of technology and radio regulations".&lt;ref name="jarl"&gt;Japan Amateur Radio League (2008).

The {{nihongo|'''Kamakura Museum of National Treasures'''|鎌倉国宝館|Kamakura Kokuhōkan}} or '''Kamakura Museum''' or '''Kamakura National Treasure House''' is a museum located on the grounds of [[Tsurugaoka Hachiman-gū]] in Yukinoshita, [[Kamakura, Kanagawa|Kamakura]], [[Kanagawa Prefecture]], [[Japan]]. The museum houses around 4800 objects from the Kamakura region including sculptures, paintings and industrial art objects. Most of these works originate from the [[Kamakura period|Kamakura]] and [[Muromachi period]]s, spanning from the 12th to the 16th century. Some of the items were produced in China and imported to Japan.&lt;ref name="leaflet"&gt;{{cite book|title= 鎌倉国宝館 - Kamakura Museum|format= leaflet|year=2009|language= Japanese, English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Name==
The term "National Treasure" in the museum's name refers to "old" [[National Treasures of Japan]], term which denoted all the state-designated [[Cultural Properties of Japan]] before the Law for the Protection of Cultural Properties came into force on August 29, 1950. All of the old national treasures became [[Important Cultural Properties of Japan|Important Cultural Properties]] and some of them have been designated as (new) National Treasures since June 9, 1951. From a current perspective the name refers to a museum housing both Important Cultural Properties and National Treasures.

==History==
The Kamakura Museum of National Treasure was founded in April 1928 to protect important art works after the [[1923 Great Kantō earthquake]]. The building, which was constructed in the same year, was modeled after the [[Shōsōin]] treasure house of [[Tōdai-ji]], [[Nara, Nara|Nara]]. During [[World War II]], in June 1945, part of the collection was evacuated to {{nihongo|Kushikawa|串川村|Kushikawa-mura}} in [[Tsukui District, Kanagawa|Tsukui District]] in the northwestern part of [[Kamakura, Kanagawa|Kamakura]], and the museum was temporarily closed between August and October 1945. The items which had been moved returned in May 1946.&lt;ref name="website"&gt;{{Cite web|title=鎌倉国宝館 - Kamakura Museum |format=Museum Homepage |accessdate=2009-06-03 |url=http://www.city.kamakura.kanagawa.jp/kokuhoukan/index.htm |language=Japanese |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090514050914/http://city.kamakura.kanagawa.jp/kokuhoukan/index.htm |archivedate=May 14, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1952, the museum came under the jurisdiction of the newly established Kamakura City Board of Education. In November 1955 it joined the {{nihongo|Kanagawa Museum Association|神奈川県博物館協会|Kanagawa-ken Hakubutsukan Kyōkai}}. The {{nihongo|"Foundation Ujiie [[Ukiyo-e]] Collection"|財団法人氏家浮世絵コレクション|}} was established in the museum in October 1974.&lt;ref name="leaflet"/&gt; In 1983 the museum's annex storage room was completed, and in May 2000 the main building was designated as a [[Registered Tangible Cultural Properties of Japan|Registered Tangible Cultural Property]].&lt;ref name="website"/&gt;

==Main Building==
The main building is a two-story reinforced concrete construction with tile-roofing and a building area of about 800㎡. There is no basement. The construction resembles the raised-floor-style of an ancient log storehouse. It was designed by {{nihongo|[[Okada Shinichirō|Okada Shin'ichirō]]|岡田信一郎}}, architect of the [[Kabuki-za]] theater and the [[Otaru, Hokkaidō|Otaru]] branch of the [[Bank of Japan]], and constructed by the Matsui Group (松井組, now Matsui Construction Co.: 松井建設株式会社). From the outside the building resembles [[Nara, Nara|Nara]]'s [[Shōsōin]] treasure house, while techniques from [[Kamakura period]] temples have been employed on the interior. The ground floor is used as storage, while the second floor contains a single exhibition hall spanning almost 600m².&lt;ref name="website"/&gt;

==Annex==
The annex is connected to the main building via a walkway on the second floor. Like the main building it is a two-story reinforced concrete construction featuring two floors above ground and a basement, with rooms for repairs and machines. The ground floor contains offices and the room of the curator, while the second floor is used as storage space.
&lt;ref name="website"/&gt;

==Highlights of the Collection==
The Kamakura Museum houses five [[National Treasures of Japan]], 73 items designated as "Important Cultural Property", and other works of art.&lt;ref name="website"/&gt; There are about 100 [[nikuhitsuga]] [[ukiyo-e]] paintings in the "Ujiie Ukiyo-e Collection".&lt;ref name="leaflet"/&gt;

[[Image:Spirou38jeunesse.jpg|thumb|right|The ''Spirou et Fantasio'' album ''La jeunesse de Spirou'' from 1987 became the launching pad for the spin-off series ''Le Petit Spirou''.]]
'''''Le Petit Spirou''''' (''Young Spirou'') is a popular [[Belgium|Belgian]] [[comic strip]] created by [[Philippe Vandevelde|Tome]] and [[Janry]] in 1987. The series developed from ''[[La jeunesse de Spirou]]'' (1987), a ''[[Spirou et Fantasio]]'' [[comics album|album]] in which Tome and Janry (at the time the authors of the series) set to imagine [[Spirou (character)|Spirou]]'s youth. It was developed into a [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] series shortly afterwards and the authors have focused on it ever since the controversy created after their final ''Spirou et Fantasio'' album, ''[[Machine qui rêve]]'' (1998). New albums are among the bestselling French-language comics, with 330,000 copies for the latest one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acbd.fr/bilan-2009.html |title=Bilan 2009 |date=December 2009 |publisher=ACBD |accessdate=6 January 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100114103127/http://www.acbd.fr/bilan-2009.html |archivedate=January 14, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to continuing to develop the character in the spirit of previous ''Spirou et Fantasio'' author [[André Franquin|Franquin]], in this series Tome and Janry paid homage to Franquin's manner of animating the gag's signature.&lt;ref&gt;gastonlagaffe.com [http://www.gastonlagaffe.com/sitefr/actu/index.php?page=20051024 Les signatures de Franquin] {{fr_icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
This series details the antics of the character as an [[elementary school]]boy. A lot of the gags center around the character's interest in the opposite sex, most notably he and his pals coming up with ways of spying on the girls' showers and dressing room. Other topics concern religion and the contradictions and absurdities of the adult world. It is generally acknowledged that, psychologically speaking, the character in ''Le Petit Spirou'' has little in common with the clean-cut adult he will become.

==Characters==
In ''La Jeunesse de Spirou'', regular characters such as Fantasio, Spip the squirrel and their enemy Zantafio also featured as children. However, when the actual ''P'tit Spirou'' series came about it was decided to leave them out and to create new characters, given that, in the original series (started in the 1930s), Spirou had not met them until adulthood.&lt;ref name=TomeInterview&gt;interview held with fans on the 28 October 1998 in [[Brussels]], formerly available on the internet.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The children===
* '''[[Spirou (character)|Spirou]]''' - The main character, already wearing his trademark red [[bellhop]] outfit.
* '''Antoine Vertignasse "Vert"''' - Spirou's best friend and companion in his adventures.
* '''Suzanne Berlingot "Suzette"''' - Spirou's girlfriend. (sometimes called "Susan" in English translations)
* '''Nicolas Ponchelot''' - Spirou's second best friend, with a good appetite and a few extra pounds.
* '''Cyprien Futu "Cassius"''' - Another friend of Spirou, of African origins. The son of the school's cook. His nickname is a reference to [[Cassius Clay]] as he is very good at boxing.
* '''Jean-Henri Masseur''' - Another friend, big but not very intelligent. In French "Masseur" sounds like "ma soeur", "My sister". This allows Suzette to trade photos of the naked Masseur for treats, as people understand ''"Je te donnerai une photo de masseur nue"'' ("I'll give you a nude photo of Masseur") as ''"Je te donnerai une photo de ma sœur  nue"'' "I'll give you a nude photo of my sister".
* '''André-Baptiste Depérinconu''' - The secret son of the abbot? In any case, he copies him in everything. Word play on French "de père inconnu", "of unknown father".
* '''Marine''' (who prefers to be called '''Mandarine''') from "My Treasure Island"

===The adults===
* '''Mr. Mégot''' - The gym teacher, always trying to organize original sporting events that always end in disaster. Drinks and smokes a lot. "Mégot" is French for a cigarette butt.
* '''Abbot Langelusse''' - He always has ideas to pray God's glory and save the souls of his flock, which usually also end in disaster. A word play on [[angelus]].
* '''Miss Claudia Chiffre''' - The math teacher. "Chiffre" is French for digit and an obvious play on the name [[Claudia Schiffer]].
* '''Melchior Dugenou''' - A timid teacher with big glasses and the boyfriend of Miss Chiffre, which nobody understands why. He is a good head shorter than his girlfriend, Miss Chiffre.
* '''Pépé Spirou''' - Spirou's grandfather and his favourite adult. At his age, he is not much wiser than his grandson. He also wears the family's trademark red outfit.
* '''Mrs. Gourmandine''' - Pépé's girlfriend.
* '''Mrs. Spirou''' - Spirou's mother, dressed in a female version of her son's red outfit.
* '''Mr. Spirou''' - Spirou's father, dressed in the standard bellboy outfit. He appears seldom in the series and his face is never seen. Tome claims that this was because he would have looked too much like the adult Spirou. Tome also claims that he did not know his own father well and that he lacked "emotional documentation on the subject".&lt;ref name=TomeInterview /&gt;

'''Magister''' is a Dutch online administrative application, used in the [[Education in the Netherlands|schooling system]] in secondary education. All of the students' information is on this platform. Students, parents and teachers are able to access this at all times. It is used to keep up with the management, administration and health issues of students, and users can also view their grades, timetable, homework assignments and absences. In 2012 the software had a 70% market share in the Netherlands.&lt;ref name="webwereld.nl"&gt;[http://webwereld.nl/overheid/56466-scholieren-afgesloten-van-gesloten-schoolsoftware webwereld.nl] published on 2 October 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Magister was put on the market as a [[SaaS]] (software as a service) by the company Schoolmaster, located in [[Leeuwarden]]. The company has been a part of the Iddink-groep since 2009.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.schoolmaster.nl/Home/Bedrijf.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

== Access ==
There are different ways to access Magister.

=== Computer ===
To be able to access Magister, installation of [[Microsoft Silverlight|Silverlight]] is needed. Since August 2014, this caused people to have issues, using the computer version that used [[Linux]] as an [[operating system]].{{clarification needed|date=June 2018}}{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

=== Mobile phone ===
There is an [[mobile app]] for [[iOS (Apple)|iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] (''Meta''). On this app, students can see their grades and timetables, and message their teacher and other students.&lt;ref name="webwereld.nl"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Magister 6, the latest version of the program, was published in August of 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.magister6.nl Magister 6]&lt;/ref&gt; It is available for students, teachers and parents.

After its launch, several groups tried integrating the technology in other ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= https://github.com/DutchCodeGeeks/MagisterHub/blob/master/libs/Magister6.md |title= MagisterHub Libraries |accessdate= 1 May 2016 |language= en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= https://github.com/DutchCodeGeeks/MagisterHub/blob/master/apps/Magister6.md |title= MagisterHub Apps |accessdate= 1 May 2016 |language= en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was possible, because the new version offers support to [[Representational state transfer|REST]]-[[Application programming interface|api]], which made the process of storing information easier.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4910">Maroon Music is a genre involving people of African descent that were not born on the continent creating songs in an African language (as opposed to their [[first language]]). It is named after the [[Maroon (people)]], African refugees who escaped from slavery in the Americas and formed independent settlements. Just as the Maroon people created their own societies in lands foreign to them in attempts to retain their freedom, Maroon music is an attempt by African American artists to reacquire their Mother tongue through writing music in an [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] African language. Maroon Music subject matter centers around stories about  Maroon leaders and other historic [[freedom fighter]]s of African descent, Maroon groups, peace, unity, and righteousness.

In the intro to Maroon music artist, Adetokunbo’s first album "Maroon Music" the history of the genre is explained:

"African refugees that escaped slavery in the Americas and formed independent settlements were called Maroons. The term can also be applied to their descendants. The same root word also gives us the English verb "to maroon".
	
When runaway slaves banded together and subsisted independently they were called Maroons. On the [[Caribbean islands]], runaway slaves formed bands and on some islands formed armed camps. Maroon communities faced great odds to survive against oppressive attackers, obtain food for subsistence living, and to reproduce and increase their numbers.&lt;ref name="brief"&gt;{{cite book

There is much variety among Maroon cultural groups because of differences in history, geography, African nationality, and the culture of indigenous people throughout the Western hemisphere.

Maroon settlements sometimes developed [[creole languages]] by mixing European tongues with their original African languages. Other times the Maroons would adopt the local European language as a common tongue, for members of the community frequently spoke a variety of Mother Tongues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/805137 | title=Maroon Societies: Rebel Slave Communities in the Americas | publisher=Anchor Press | author=Price, Richard | year=1973 | location=Garden City, NY | pages=25 | isbn=0385065086}}&lt;/ref&gt;

What you are about to hear is a family’s journey to reacquire their Mother Tongue through song. Their goal is to reacquire that which was lost in the [[Middle Passage]]. Let this music, Maroon Music, serve as their testament to freedom in a world that has nothing but contempt for the self liberated."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media

Maroon music is less concerned with the perfection and fluency of speech of the African language but more with the exercise of learning and improving communication, while providing subtitles and written keys in English so that others will understand the message attempting to be conveyed by the artist.  As [[pidgin]] English is noted as "is a simplified version of a language that develops as a means of communication between two or more groups that do not have a language in common [[Pidgin]], Maroon music employs the pidginization or [[Creolization]] of African languages as a simplified means for African Americans to communicate with indigenous Africans.  For this reason, key’s and subtitles in Maroon Music videos are an essential component for conveying intended meaning to both indigenous Africans and those born abroad.

The [[Maroon (people)|Maroon]]s are a number of diverse peoples in the [[Caribbean]], [[South America]], [[North America]] and [[Central America]], the descendants of escaped slaves.  The [[Seminole music]] tradition of the United States is an example, as are numerous communities in [[Jamaica]], [[Suriname]] and [[French Guiana]].

The Surinamese, Guyanese, and French Guianan escaped slaves managed to hide in the dense jungles of the area, and formed communities like the [[Aluku]], [[Saramaka]] and [[Ndyuka people|Ndjuka]].  Their traditional sung stories are called ''mato'', and there is also a kind of popular Maroon music called [[aleke]].  Traditional dances include ''awasa'', a women's social dance.

The Jamaican Maroons are known for instruments like the ''abeng'', a kind of horn.

'''Milonga''' is a musical genre that originated in the [[Río de la Plata]] areas of [[Argentina]] and [[Uruguay]]. It was very popular in the 1870s. It was derived from an earlier style of singing known as the ''[[payada]] de contrapunto''. The song was set to a lively {{music|time|2|4}} [[Time signature|tempo]], as are most milongas.

"Milonga is an excited [[habanera (music)|habanera]]." The original habanera divided into four pulses, in a standard two-four where [[staccatissimo|every note was stressed]]. In becoming milonga, though, all four notes turned strong, as tempo was doubled. The strength of the first beat weakened the fourth giving an almost waltz-like feel to milonga: one-two-three(four), one-two-three(four).
Habanera is a slower, more explicit sounding ''one'', two, ''three''-four. At least one modern tango pianist believes the [[polka]] influenced the speeding up of the milonga.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Thompson. "Tango the Art History of Love" page 129&lt;/ref&gt;

Milonga has a [[Syncopation|syncopated]] beat, consisting of 8 beats with accents on the 1st (sometimes also 2nd), 4th, 5th, and 7th beats.

Over time, dance steps and other musical influences were added, eventually giving rise to the [[Tango (dance)|tango]].

By the 1890s musicians were writing in a structured form that was something more than thinly disguised ''milongas'' or ''tangos andaluces'', and would later become the fully developed tango.&lt;ref&gt;Tango!

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5952">{{Culture of Suriname}}
The '''music of Suriname''' is known for [[kaseko]] music, and for having an [[Indo-Caribbean]] tradition.

==Kaseko==
{{main|Kaseko}}
''Kaseko'' is probably derived from the [[French language|French]] expression ''casser le corps'' (''break the body''), which was used during slavery to indicate a very swift dance.  Kaseko is a fusion of numerous popular and folk styles derived from Europe, Africa and the Americas.  It is [[rhythm]]ically complex, with [[percussion instrument]]s including [[skratji]] (a very large bass drum) and [[snare drum]]s, as well as [[saxophone]], [[trumpet]] and occasionally [[trombone]].  Singing can be both solo and choir.  Songs are typically [[call and response (music)|call-and-response]], as are Creole folk styles from the area, such as [[kawina]].

Kaseko evolved in the 1930s during festivities that used large bands, especially [[brass band]]s, and was called [[Bigi Pokoe]] (''big drum music'').  Following World War II, [[jazz]], [[calypso music|calypso]] and other importations became popular, while [[rock and roll]] from the United States soon left its own influence in the form of electrified instruments.

==Hindi-Surinamese music/[[Baithak Gana]]==
[[Music of India|Indian music]] arrived with immigrants from South Asia.  This originally included folk music played with [[dhantal]], [[tabla]], [[sitar]], [[Pump organ|harmonium]] and [[dholak]], later including [[tassa]] drums.  Music was mostly [[Hinduism|Hindu]] songs called [[bhajan]]s, as well as [[filmi]].  The [[tan singing]] style is unique to the Indian community in Suriname and Guyana.

Alioko is also a very popular form of religious music that developed through different cultures and made its way to Suriname. Using drums and forms of guitars they communicate with the spirits and gods through this ( al- ee- ock - oh ) music.

Recorded Indian music in Suriname began with the release of ''King of Suriname/The Star Melodies Of Ramdew Chaitoe'' by [[Ramdew Chaitoe]], in 1958.  Chaitoe became very popular, and his music, which was religious in nature, left a lasting influence on future performers.  However, no one very successful arose following Chaitoe, until 1968, when [[Dropati]] released ''[[Let's Sing and Dance]]'', an album of religious songs that remains extremely popular.

In 1958, East Indian music finally made its debut on the recording industry with the release of an album of devotional songs, by Ramdew Chaitoe of Suriname. His album titled, ''King of Suriname'' and ''The Star Melodies of Ramdew Chaitoe'' was quite appropriately named, as it made him a household name with East Indians not just in Suriname, but throughout the Caribbean. Although his songs were religious in nature, the use of the strong beats of the dhantal and dholak, coupled with his own creolised version of Hindi often had many listeners dancing as if it were a pop song. In fact, one song, "Raat Ke Sapna," would go on to become a huge dance hit in the decades to follow. 

Although the release of King of Suriname presented a breakthrough for East Indian music, it was quite short lived, as few artists managed to succeed Ramdew Chaitoe in the years to follow. It was not until the 1960s that another Surinamese would catapult East Indian music onto the scene once again. In 1968, a woman by the name of Dropati debuted with an album of traditional wedding songs, titled, Lets Sing &amp; Dance. Once again, although religious in nature, Dropati's songs, much like those of Ramdew Chaitoe, went on to become huge pop hits within the East Indian community. Dropati's epic songs such as "Gowri Pooja" and "Lawa" became such big hits that they firmly secured her name in history as one of the pillars of Indo-Caribbean music (Dropati, 1993). Lets Sing &amp; Dance along with King of Suriname remain two of the best selling East Indian albums of all time, even to this day (Ramdew Chaitoe, 1993). The effects of the release of these two albums were tremendous. Not only did they prove East Indian music as a legitimate art form, but they also united the East Indians of the Caribbean regardless of whether they were Guyanese, Trinidadian, Jamaican or Surinamese. However, these two albums also showed the need for a more popular, non-religious form of East Indian music, one that would combine the high pitched dholak, dhantal &amp; tassa drum beats with the folk and Hindi lyrics that made Lets Sing &amp; Dance and King of Suriname/The Star Melodies Of Ramdew Chaitoe becoming so popular.&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20000823032141/http://saxakali.com/caribbean/Hemchandra1.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;big&gt;'''Hindustani Classical music in Suriname'''&lt;/big&gt;

With the help of Government of India, the "Indiaase cultureel Centrum" was established under Embassy of India in Paramaribo. Many teachers visited on deputation and promoted Hindustani classical Music.  Prof. Kinot, Ms. Sujata, Ut. Md. Sayeed Khan, Mr. Ardhendu Shekhar, Mrs. Rita Bokil and a few more teachers came. Prof. Rajesh Kelkar (from historic Maharaja Sayajirao University of Baroda), while working with the Cultural centre, expanded teaching of music to Nickerie (247 km from capital) and other places with missionary zeal. His efforts took Indian music into interior villages of Suriname. His services were longest in Suriname.

'''Oscar's Grind''' is a [[betting strategy]] used by gamblers on wagers where the outcome is [[Even money|evenly distributed]] between two results of equal value (like flipping a coin, betting on red or black in [[roulette]], etc.). It is an archetypal positive progression strategy. It is also called Hoyle's Press. In German and French it is often referred to as the Pluscoup Progression. It was first documented by Allan Wilson in his 1965 book,''The Casino Gambler's Guide''.&lt;ref name="masonlynne"&gt;{{citation | year=1993 | title = Fundamentals of Craps | author1=Mason Malmuth | author2=Lynne Loomis | publisher=Two Plus Two Publishing | isbn=1-880685-30-2 | page=46 | url=https://books.google.hu/books?id=ktT1ac4f_PoC&amp;pg=PA46 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This progression is based on calculating the size of bets so that in the event of a [[losing streak]], if and when a same-length [[Winning streak (sports)|winning streak]] occurs, a profit is obtained. The main concept is that there are periods of many wins and periods of many losses. Losses and wins often come in streaks. Ideally, bets are kept low on losing streaks and increased on winning streaks, which hopefully will follow.

==Description==

Oscar's Grind divides the entire gambling event into sessions. A session is a sequence of consecutive wagers made until 1 unit of profit is won. Each session begins by betting 1 unit, and ends by winning 1 unit of profit. If the gambler loses, the session continues and the bet is repeated. Each time the gambler wins the game following a lost game, the bet is increased by 1 unit. This increase is not performed if the current bet warrants achieving at least 1 unit of profit in total, in case the next game is won. On the contrary, the bet size in such a situation should be decreased to assure exactly 1 unit is won. Given infinite money and time, this makes sure that every session ends with a 1 unit profit.

===Algorithm===

   ''betsize'' := 1
   ''profit'' := 0
   '''REPEAT'''
    Bet
    '''IF''' bet_won, '''THEN'''
        ''profit'' := ''profit''+''betsize''
        '''IF''' ''profit'' &lt; 1 '''THEN'''
            '''IF''' ''profit''+''betsize''+1 &gt; 1 '''THEN'''
                ''betsize'' := 1-''profit''
            '''ELSE'''
                ''betsize'' := ''betsize''+1
    '''ELSE'''
        ''profit'' := ''profit'' - ''betsize''
   '''UNTIL''' ''profit'' = 1

==Analysis==

Oscar's Grind is the same as [[Martingale (betting system)|Martingale]]-based and [[Labouchère system]] in the sense that if you have an infinite amount to wager and time, every session will make a profit. Not meeting these conditions will result in an inevitable loss of your entire stake in the long run. You can only lose 500 times in a row from a 500 unit bankroll, and if occasional wins increase the betsize, this number decreases significantly. Oscar's Grind is based on losing streaks being "compensated" by winning streaks in the short run, and in the example above, a 5-long losing streak was equalised by a 3-long winning streak. If we get 'compensated' with a 5-long winning streak, we get 3 units of profit. The base of the system originates in a hot-hand bias, but winning and losing streaks in gambling have no mathematical ground or proof.

==Variations==

Oscar's Grind can be applied to non-even bets as well ("streets" in [[roulette]] or "doubling" in [[blackjack]]); one just has to keep track of the amount and increase the betsize after wins accordingly. There are also variations that try to reduce the [[variance]] by waiting for a couple of wins before increasing the betsize. As it is with all betting progressions, no variation of Oscar's Grind will make a profit in the long run.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://imspirit.wordpress.com/2012/12/16/why-any-progression-must-fail-for-negative-expectancy-games-in-the-long-run/|title=Why Any Progression Must Fail for Negative Expectancy Games in the Long Run?|date=December 2012|publisher=imspirit.wordpress.com|accessdate=26 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7926">In [[linguistics]], '''phraseology''' is the study of set or fixed expressions, such as [[idiom]]s, [[phrasal verb]]s, and other types of multi-word [[lexical unit]]s (often collectively referred to as ''[[phraseme]]s''), in which the component parts of the expression take on a meaning more specific than or otherwise not predictable from the sum of their meanings when used independently. For example, ‘[[Dutch auction]]’ is composed of the words ''Dutch'' ‘of or pertaining to the Netherlands’ and ''auction'' ‘a public sale in which goods are sold to the highest bidder’, but its meaning is not ‘a sale in the Netherlands where goods are sold to the highest bidder’. Instead, the phrase has a conventionalized meaning referring to any auction where, instead of rising, the prices fall.

== History of the development of phraseology ==
Phraseology (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] φράσις ''phrasis'', "way of speaking" and -λογία ''-logia'', "study of") is a scholarly approach to language which developed in the twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;Knappe, Gabriele. (2004) Idioms and Fixed Expressions in English Language Study before 1800. Peter Lang.&lt;/ref&gt; It took its start when [[Charles Bally]]'s&lt;ref&gt;Bally, Charles (1909 [1951]) Traité de stylistique française. Genève: Georg et Cie.&lt;/ref&gt; notion of ''locutions phraseologiques'' entered Russian [[lexicology]] and [[lexicography]] in the 1930s and 1940s and was subsequently developed in the former Soviet Union and other Eastern European countries. From the late 1960s on it established itself in (East) German linguistics but was also sporadically approached in English linguistics. The earliest English adaptations of phraseology are by Weinreich (1969)&lt;ref&gt;Weinreich, Uriel (1969)  Problems in the Analysis of Idioms. In J. Puhvel (ed.), Substance and Structure of Language, 23-81. Berkeley/Los Angeles: University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt; within the approach of [[transformational grammar]], Arnold (1973),&lt;ref&gt;Arnold, I.V. (1973) The English Word Moscow: Higher School Publishing House&lt;/ref&gt; and Lipka (1992 [1974]).&lt;ref&gt;Lipka, Leonhard. 1992. An Outline of English Lexicology. Tübingen: Max Niemeyer Verlag.&lt;/ref&gt; In Great Britain as well as other Western European countries, phraseology has steadily been developed over the last twenty years. The activities of the European Society of Phraseology (EUROPHRAS) and the European Association for Lexicography (EURALEX) with their regular conventions and publications attest to the prolific European interest in phraseology. European scholarship in phraseology is more active than in North America. Bibliographies of recent studies on English and general phraseology are included in Welte (1990)&lt;ref&gt;Welte, Werner. (1990) Englische Phraseologie und Idiomatik. Ein Arbeitsbuch mit umfassender Bibliographie. Frankfurt: Peter Lang.&lt;/ref&gt; and specially collected in Cowie &amp; Howarth (1996)&lt;ref&gt;Cowie, A. P. &amp; Peter Howarth.  (1996) Phraseology - a Select Bibliography. ''International Journal of Lexicography'' 9(1): 38–51&lt;/ref&gt; whose bibliography is reproduced and continued on the internet and provides a rich source of the most recent publications in the field.

==Phraseological units==
{{Main | Phraseme}}
The basic units of analysis in phraseology are often referred to as [[phraseme]]s or ''phraseological units''. Phraseological units are (according to Prof. Kunin A.V.){{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} stable word-groups with partially or fully transferred meanings ("to kick the bucket",  “Greek gift”, “drink till all's blue”, “drunk as a fiddler (drunk as a lord, as a boiled owl)”, “as mad as a hatter (as a march hare)”). According to Rosemarie Gläser, a phraseological unit is a lexicalized, reproducible bilexemic or polylexemic word group in common use, which has relative syntactic and semantic stability, may be idiomatized, may carry [[connotations]], and may have an emphatic or intensifying function in a text.&lt;ref&gt;Gläser, Rosemarie. 1998. The Stylistic Potential of Phraselological Units in the Light of Genre Analysis In A.P. Cowie (ed.), Phraseology. Oxford: Clarendon Press, page 125.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Planet Comics''''' was a [[science fiction]] [[comic book]] title published by [[Fiction House]] from January 1940 to Winter 1953. It was the first comic book dedicated wholly to science fiction.&lt;ref name="Benton, Mike 1992 p.33"&gt;Benton, Mike. ''Science Fiction Comics: The Illustrated History'' (Dallas, TX: Taylor Publishing Company, 1992), p.33&lt;/ref&gt; Like most of Fiction House's early comics titles, ''Planet Comics'' was a spinoff of a [[pulp magazine]], in this case ''[[Planet Stories]].'' Like the magazine before it, Planet Comics featured [[Space Opera|space operatic]] tales of muscular, heroic space adventurers who were quick with their "ray pistols" and always running into gorgeous females who needed rescuing from [[Bug-eyed monster|bug-eyed space aliens]] or fiendish interstellar bad guys.

==Publication history==
''Planet Comics'' #1 was released with a cover-date of January 1940, and ran for 73 issues until Winter 1953.&lt;ref name="Index"/&gt; Initially produced on a monthly schedule, issue #8 (September  1940) saw it slip to a bimonthly title, which it held until the end of 1949. From issue #26 (September  1943), "Planet Comics was cut to 60 pages," resulting in the merging of two strips: Flint Baker and Reef Ryan.&lt;ref name="Fandom"/&gt; Issue #63 (Winter 1949) began a quarterly release schedule, but #64, #65, and #66 were ultimately released annually, dated Spring 1950, 1951, and 1952, respectively. Issue #67 (Summer 1952) got the comic back on its quarterly release schedule, but the title only lasted a further seven issues, with its last (#73) again delayed for over a year, following issue #72 (Fall 1953).&lt;ref name="Index"/&gt;

==Style and Themes==
''Planet Comics'' was the foremost purveyor of [[Good Girl Art|good girl art]] in comic books of the period, and is considered highly collectible by modern fans of comics' [[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden Age]]. It specialized in colorful and lurid stories of interstellar action, ingenuous and attractive heroes and heroines, breezy dialogue, and the “barest smattering of sense and substance” (Benton 1992, p.&amp;nbsp;27). Its covers usually featured a beautiful, scantily-attired spacewoman with long bare legs being menaced by a frightful alien monster, while a sleek, heroic spaceman comes to her rescue.

Sometimes, though, ''Planet Comics'' reversed this formula: both covers and stories occasionally provided heroines who handily defeated the space aliens and interplanetary villains with little or no assistance from males (the comic was also seen as a [[fantasy]] title). Cynics might have noted that this sex-equality strategy in effect simply multiplied the number of lovely girls shown per panel, and insured that each and every panel featured at least one smashing spacegirl.

==Writers==
The Flint Baker/Space Ranger stories, according to Raymond Miller, "featured such writers as Al Schmidt and Huxley Haldane."&lt;ref name="Fandom"/&gt; [[Jerry Bails]] and Hames Ware's ''Who's Who of American Comic Books'' mentions Herman Bolstein and [[Dick Briefer]].&lt;ref name="bailsprojects.com"&gt;{{Cite book | url=http://www.bailsprojects.com/(S(c23lk3m1vw05jqyyia32vwq0))/WhosWho.aspx | last1=Bails | first1=Jerry | last2=Ware | first2=Hames | title=Who's Who of American Comic Books | accessdate=2009-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bails and Ware also list writers including [[Walter B. Gibson]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | url=http://www.bailsprojects.com/(S(4wo2unyuim5qa5ys1myqw245))/bio.aspx?Name=GIBSON%2c+WALTER | chapter=Walter Gibson | last1=Bails | first1=Jerry | last2=Ware | first2=Hames | title=Who's Who of American Comic Books | accessdate=2009-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; (''[[The Shadow]]'') and [[Frank Belknap Long]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | url=http://www.bailsprojects.com/(S(4wo2unyuim5qa5ys1myqw245))/bio.aspx?Name=LONG%2c+FRANK+BELKNAP | chapter=Frank Belknap Long | last1=Bails | first1=Jerry | last2=Ware | first2=Hames | title=Who's Who of American Comic Books | accessdate=2009-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; as working on "various features" for ''Planet Comics'' throughout the 1940s.

==Artists==
The strong female heroines of ''Planet Comics'' were complemented by Fiction House's employing several female artists to work on such tales, particularly [[Lily Renée]], [[Marcia Snyder]], [[Ruth Atkinson]], and [[Fran Hopper|Fran(ces) Hopper]] (née Dietrick), whose art for "Mysta of the Moon" was often stunning. In addition, many artists who would become well-known names worked on ''Planet Comics'' stories over its 13-year history. These included the likes of [[Murphy Anderson]], [[Matt Baker (artist)|Matt Baker]], [[Nick Cardy]], Joe Doolin, [[Graham Ingels]], [[George Evans (comics)|George Evans]], [[Ruben Moreira]], [[John Cullen Murphy]], [[George Tuska]], and Maurice Whitman.

The early covers were drawn by industry legend [[Will Eisner]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://comics.org/series.lasso?SeriesID=162 ''Planet Comics''] at the [[Grand Comics Database]]. Retrieved 2009-05-16.&lt;/ref&gt; Later covers were predominantly the work of two men — Dan Zolnerowich (later Dan Zolne) and Joe Doolin. Zolne is believed to have produced covers for issues #10-25 (January 1941 – July 1943), and Doolin is thought to have illustrated all-bar-three of #26-65 (September  1943 – Spring 1951).&lt;ref name="Index"&gt;{{Cite book | last=Steele | first=Henry | title=Fiction House - A Golden Age Index | publisher=Al Dellinges | year=1978}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception and Influence==
While young male readers were no doubt attracted to the pin-up quality of ''Planet Comics'''s artwork, letters from readers printed in the comic demonstrate that its readership also included girls, who were perhaps drawn to the array of competent and capable space heroines (Benton 1991, p.&amp;nbsp;31). '''''Planet Comics''''' was considered by noted fan Raymond Miller to be "perhaps the best of the [[Fiction House]] group," as well as "most collected and most valued."&lt;ref name="Fandom"&gt;{{Cite journal | last=Miller | first=Raymond | title=Planet Comics | editor-first=G.B | editor-last=Love | journal=The Fandom Annual | issue=2 | publisher=SFCA | date=c. 1970/1971 | pages=118–121}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Miller's opinion, it "wasn't really featuring good art or stories... in the first dozen or so issues," not gaining most of "its better known characters" until "about the 10th issue." "Only 3 of [its] long running strips started with the first issue... Flint Baker, Auro - Lord of Jupiter, and the Red Comet."&lt;ref name="Fandom"/&gt;

The comics historian John Benton offers this summary: “Planet Comics was the epitome of breezy, sexy, mindless, action-filled science fiction. In many respects [it was] a throwback to the earlier science fiction magazines and simpler times.”.&lt;ref name="Benton, Mike 1992 p.33"/&gt;

==Characters and Features==
*'''Flint Baker''' – One of the longest-running strips, Flint Baker was another athletic space hero, who became part of the Space Rangers. Baker's debut story, "The One-Eyed Monster Men From Mars", was also the first story in ''Planet Comics'' #1, illustrated by [[Dick Briefer]]. Flint Baker was the "main hero" and "cover feature" of most of the first 13 issues, and after 25 issues he "team[ed] up with Reef Ryan to form the Space Rangers" when ''Planet Comics'' dropped its page count. Appearances between issues #2 and #60 (initially as "Flint Baker," later as "Space Rangers") were illustrated by a full range of artists, including Nick Viscardi, Joe Doolin and Artie Saff,&lt;ref name="Fandom"/&gt; Arthur Peddy, [[Lee Elias]], [[Frank Doyle (writer)|Frank Doyle]], and Joe Cavallo.&lt;ref name="Index"/&gt; The Space Rangers "were drawn by Lee Elias, Bob Lubbers," and others.&lt;ref name="Fandom"/&gt;
*'''Auro, Lord of Jupiter''' – Two different characters of this name appeared in ''Planet Comics''. The first incarnation was the son of Professor Hardwich, and appeared in most issues between #1-29. He was essentially an outer space version of [[Tarzan]], where Auro was "befriended by a [[saber tooth tiger]]," stranded on Jupiter with "muscles... as strong as steel" thanks to the higher gravitational pull of the planet. The best artwork on the first series of Auro stories was, wrote Miller, "by Raphael Astarita,"&lt;ref name="Fandom"/&gt; whose name Jerry Bails and Hames Ware spell "Rafael".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | url=http://www.bailsprojects.com/(S(c23lk3m1vw05jqyyia32vwq0))/bio.aspx?Name=ASTARITA%2c+RAFAEL | chapter=Rafael Astarita | last1=Bails | first1=Jerry | last2=Ware | first2=Hames | title=Who's Who of American Comic Books | accessdate=2009-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Auro's second incarnation started 11 issues after his first ended, in issue #41, when a young scientist named Chester Edson "crashes on Jupiter," and his "spirit is transferred into the body of [the original] Auro," who is thus resurrected as a [[Flash Gordon]]-esque hero.&lt;ref name="Fandom"/&gt; Miller names Dick Charles as the main writer of both series; Bails and Ware list only Richard Case and Herman Bolstein.&lt;ref name="bailsprojects.com"/&gt; Auro was illustrated by a number of different artists, among them Doolin, [[Graham Ingels]], and Astarita.&lt;ref name="Index"/&gt; Miller suggests that August Froelich drew the appearance in issue #41, and says that Ingels "was the last artist."&lt;ref name="Fandom"/&gt;
*'''The Red Comet''' – A "costumed [[superhero|hero]] who fought crime all over the universe," the Comet sometimes "grew to giant-size, like the [[Spectre (comics)|Spectre]]." The feature was written (according to Miller) by Cy Thatcher and appeared in issues #1, #3-20, and #37.&lt;ref name="Fandom"/&gt; Accompanied by a "girl, Dolores, and a boy, Rusty," his adventures were illustrated for odd adventures by Rudy Palais and a host of artists, with only Alex Blum (#6-10) and Saul Rosen (#17-19) thought to have drawn more than two episodes.&lt;ref name="Index"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fandom"/&gt;
*'''The Lost World''' - The Red Comet was replaced by "The Lost World," which appeared in issues #21-69, as the lead feature (becoming one of the longest-running strips) featuring [[Hunt Bowman]]. The first episode was drawn by Palais, with Viscardi taking over for issue #22.&lt;ref name="Index"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fandom"/&gt; Set in the 33rd century, Bowman was a guerrilla-fighter (alongside Lyssa, Queen of the Lost World) against the reptilian Voltamen, conquerors of Earth. (Miller notes that "[i]n #24 Hunt and Lyssa returned to Earth... [and] never returned to the Lost World.") In issue #36, the duo were joined by "3 more Earth people," named Bruce, Robin, and Bonnie.&lt;ref name="Fandom"/&gt; Later episodes were drawn by Ingels (c. #24-31), Lily Renée (#32-49), and [[George Evans (comics)|George Evans]] (#50-64).&lt;ref name="Index"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fandom"/&gt;
*'''Reef Ryan''' – A heroic space captain, "[not] much different from... Flint Baker," Ryan also became part of the Space Rangers, after appearing solo in issues #13-25. Miller names the writer of Reef Ryan (and then Space Rangers) as "Hugh Fitzhugh". Ryan was soon dropped from the newly named strip, however, in favor of a boy named Hero (issue #42).&lt;ref name="Fandom"/&gt; Initially drawn by Al Gabriele, later issues featured inks by [[George Tuska]].&lt;ref name="Index"/&gt;
*'''The Space Rangers''' – From issue #26, with ''Planet Comics''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt; page count dropped, "instead of dropping any characters, the Ryan and Baker strips were combined to form the Space Rangers."&lt;ref name="Fandom"/&gt; The Space Rangers' uniforms were echoed by those seen on TV's [[Rocky Jones Space Ranger]] (1954).
*'''Gale Allen''' – A voluptuous female space adventurer who led her [[Feminist|all girl]] "girl squadron" on wild outings, Gale appeared in almost every issue between #4 and #42.&lt;ref name="Fandom"/&gt; Written by Douglas McKee, Gale and her Girl Squadron were illustrated by [[Bob Powell (comics)|Bob Powell]] in issues #4-10 and Fran Deitrick/Hopper in #28-40.&lt;ref name="Index"/&gt; In or around issue #34, the squadron were dropped.&lt;ref name="Fandom"/&gt;
*'''Futura''' – Gale's replacement feature was, according to Miller, "a good series with fine art," a smashingly lovely crusader for interplanetary justice, and she appeared in issues #43-64.&lt;ref name="Fandom"/&gt; The first six issues were drawn by Astarita in the style of [[Mac Raboy]], while Joseph Cavallo is thought to have inked/drawn many of the later issues.&lt;ref name="Index"/&gt; Futura began "with a scantily-clad girl... abducted by her invisible pursuer" and taken to "the city of Cymradia in space." The strip was drawn in a manner similar to ''[[Prince Valiant]]'', with "no [[word balloon]]s in the panels."&lt;ref name="Fandom"/&gt;
*'''Star Pirate''' – The "[[Robin Hood]] of the space lanes" looked very much like the [[DC Comics]] hero [[Starman (comics)|Starman]], and appeared between issues #12 and #64. Among several artists, George Appel produced a dozen early issues, while the bulk of issues #33-51 were drawn by [[Murphy Anderson]], whose additions transformed the Pirate into "an almost completely new strip."&lt;ref name="Fandom"/&gt; Three late issues (#59-61) are credited to [[newspaper comic strip]] artist [[Leonard Starr]].&lt;ref name="Index"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fandom"/&gt;
*'''Mars, God of War''' – Named by Miller as "one of the most famous" strips, the adventures of the [[Mars (mythology)|ancient Roman God]] causing violent mischief on other planets appeared between issues #15 and #35.&lt;ref name="Index"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fandom"/&gt; They were credited to writer Ross Gallen, and all drawn by Doolin. The embodiment of evil, the spirit of Mars would "single out a man or woman who had evil in them," possess them, and run rampant until "the end of each story [when] good always triumphed."&lt;ref name="Fandom"/&gt;
*'''Mysta of the Moon''' – In the "Mars" feature in ''Planet Comics'' #35, the god discovers "a young boy and girl" taken to the moon by one Dr. Kort, who has "placed all the culture and knowledge known to man into their brains." In the events that follow, Mars possesses the boy's robot, and is ultimately defeated by the girl, although the boy and his robot are killed. The girl was Mysta, a gorgeous female version of [[Captain Future]] with a robot sidekick, and she took over from "Mars" in title as well as spirit in issue #36.&lt;ref name="Fandom"/&gt; Appearing in issues #36-52 and #55-62, after Doolin, the strip was most notably illustrated by Fran Hopper (#37-42, #48-49).&lt;ref name="Index"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fandom"/&gt;
*'''Norge Benson''' - Between issues #12-32, comedy relief was provided by Norge Benson, written by "Olaf Bjorn," whom Miller identifies as Kip Beales.

Al Walker drew issues #12-22, with Renée, [[Jim Mooney]], and Fran Hopper drawing later episodes.&lt;ref name="Fandom"/&gt;

'''Ronald Charles Waldron''' (29 June 1923 – 13 January 2015), known professionally as '''Ronnie Ronalde''', was a British [[music hall]] singer and [[whistling|siffleur]]. Ronalde was famous for his voice, whistling, [[yodelling]], imitations of [[bird song]] and stage personality. His crystal clear [[yodelling]] gained him acceptance with connoisseurs of Alpine and Western music around the world.

==Biography==

===Early life: the Silver Songsters===
Ronalde grew up in a poor but supportive [[Islington]] home, and found a talent for singing, whistling and bird impressions from early childhood. In these formative years, he [[busking|entertained informally]] for [[Allowance (money)|pocket money]], or with [[church choir|church and school choirs]], developing his talents for stage performance.

During a time in which he was training for [[accountancy]], Ronalde was invited to become one of Arturo Steffani's Silver Songsters, aged 15.  This 21-piece boys' choir was known for its complex vocal and visual arrangements of popular songs, with each boy usually going into other trades when older. Steffani was so taken with Ronalde's voice and whistling (he referred to him as "the Pink of Perfection"), that he disbanded the Silver Songsters (in 1947) and became his personal manager, [[mentorship|mentor]] and [[Chaperone (social)|chaperone]]. They later toured all over the world together.

After wartime service, Steffani encouraged Ronalde to study singing in London and yodelling in [[Switzerland]], and for nearly a decade he began working his way up the bill, not only as a solo [[Variety show|Variety performer]], but also under his new name: Ronnie Ronalde.

===1950s: the halcyon years===
After early struggles, Ronalde's first successful UK tour (in the late 1940s) met him with a wave of interest.  Ronalde’s first recordings were with [[Decca Records]] (these were only to be whistling performances), but his first major label contract came from [[EMI]]. Ronalde would also join [[Pye Records|Pye]], [[Major Minor Records|Major Minor]] and [[Columbia Records|Columbia]] records, becoming a million-selling artiste.

"If I Were a Blackbird" (1950) is among Ronalde's most famous songs from this period. This rendering of [[Delia Murphy]]'s Irish folk song had him in the British top 20 for 6 months. She would later jovially express her thanks for boosting her income. Other songs include "[[Tritsch-Tratsch-Polka|Tritsch Tratsch Polka]]" (a showcase of Ronalde's high speed delivery [[whistling]]) and "Bells Across the Meadow" (by [[Albert Ketèlbey]]). His best known recording is "[[In a Monastery Garden]]" (by [[Albert Ketèlbey]]).  Ronalde played it as his show finale for decades, and over a million copies of it have been sold in their varying formats.

Across this decade Ronalde was a headliner, and broke box office records all over the world: he was a big name in the UK, US, [[Australasia]], [[Scandinavia]], Africa, South America and Europe. Such was his success in the US in the 1950s, he was seen as serious competition to [[Frank Sinatra]] and [[Bing Crosby]], and others such as [[Richard Tauber]] and [[Josef Locke]].

Ronalde had his own BBC Radio Show from 1949 called ''The Voice of Variety''.  During this series, the volume of Ronalde's [[fan mail]] caused a problem for the BBC.  The ''Voice of Variety News'' fan publication had a print of 55,000 copies twice yearly, and [[fan club]]s during this era existed all across the UK.  [[Thames TV]] also presented a weekly show titled ''Meet Ronnie Ronalde''.

In 1949 Ronalde filled [[Radio City Music Hall]] in New York City (with capacity of over six thousand) every night for ten weeks.  He was at that time the most frequent UK artiste to ever perform there (over a thousand times). During the same period he filled a 25,000 capacity venue in [[Toronto]], Canada, for a fortnight. In February 1956, the British music magazine ''[[NME]]'' reported that [[Billy Cotton]] and Ronalde had released versions of "Happy Trails", the [[theme music]] to [[Associated Television|ATV]]'s weekly ''[[Roy Rogers]]'' series.&lt;ref name="NME Rock 'N' Roll Years"&gt;{{cite book

Ronalde also performed for [[Queen Elizabeth II]] and [[Prince Philip]] at the [[Royal Command Performance]] at the [[London Coliseum]]. A [[Daily Express]] reporter commented on the Prince's attempts to demonstrate whistling to the Queen after this performance. He appeared before Prince Philip again.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

===Later life===

At the height of his popularity Ronalde foresaw a decline in variety performing and took a step away from the limelight.  Nonetheless, Ronalde did not abandon the entertainment industry: he maintained an engagement diary and summer seasons into his 80s, as well as tv appearances  and radio broadcasts. He settled on the island of [[Guernsey]] in the 1960s, being attracted to it after a performance there.  He purchased a hotel (St Martin's, which would come to be known as Ronnie Ronalde's Hotel), and met [[Austrians|Austrian]] wife Rosemarie who would become his business manager following Steffani's death. After bringing up three children, both he and Rosemarie moved to the [[Isle of Man]] in the late 1980s, then to Whistler's Lodge in [[New Zealand]] in the 1990s, to the [[Gold Coast, Queensland]], Australia, and returned to the UK in the last years of his life. In [[New Zealand]] in 1990, Ronalde filled the 2,500-capacity [[Aotea Square|Aotea Theatre]], and was invited to stay for another concert. He was also asked to return for repeat performances in both [[Auckland]] and [[Christchurch]] town halls.

Ronalde was awarded America's North Carolina Louisburg Hall of Fame Award in 1995, their highest acclaim, given only to artists of outstanding international distinction.

His recording "Bird Song at Eventide" was featured in the hit TV series, and subsequent best-selling soundtrack, ''[[The Singing Detective]]'' in 1986.

His 1998 autobiography entitled ''Around the World on a Whistle'' drew extensively on [[memorabilia]], theatre bills, photographs and clippings, and is a document of the published history of [[music hall|variety circuits]]. He quipped that his next book would have been "an Encyclopaedia of Whistling".

EMI Australia released a CD with the same title ''Around the World on a Whistle'' in the 1990s. In testament to the longevity of his popularity, this gained him another [[music recording sales certification|Gold Disc]] and a small upsurge in his career. EMI subsequently released a number of albums of Ronalde's early works that had not been available since their original [[gramophone record|gramophone]] releases.

In 2002, he was inducted into the exclusive entertainment charitable fraternity, the [[Grand Order of Water Rats]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gowr.co.uk/all-water-rats/v/34|title=Biography of a Water Rat|publisher=GOWR.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ronalde appeared in the 2007 Australian feature film ''[[Clubland (2007 film)|Clubland]]''.

Ronalde made an appearance at the [[Hackney Empire]] for a charity evening, The Golden Years of Variety, on Sunday 9 September 2012, when he received a standing ovation. His final public appearance was at [[Beccles]] Public Hall &amp; Theatre on Sunday 19 May 2013.

He suffered a stroke shortly after his 90th birthday in 2013, and subsequently moved into [[Brinsworth House]], the retired entertainers' home in Twickenham, where he died.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.islandfm.com/news/index.php?storyid=38891&amp;s=6|title=Ronnie Ronalde Passes Away|publisher=islandfm.com|date=16 January 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150118213553/http://www.islandfm.com/news/index.php?storyid=38891&amp;s=6|archivedate=18 January 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;reF&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/ronnie-ronalde-music-hall-artiste-famous-for-his-whistling-and-yodelling-9993733.html|title=Ronnie Ronalde: Music hall artiste famous for his whistling and yodelling |first=Spencer |last=Leigh |newspaper=The Independent|date=22 January 2015 |accessdate=4 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The comedians [[Bob Hope]], [[Jimmy Edwards]], [[Morecambe and Wise]], [[Bob Monkhouse]], [[Peter Cook]], [[Max Wall]] and [[Max Bygraves]] have all made references to 'Whistling Ronnie' in their routines.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} [[Terry-Thomas]] joked that he was sick of hearing Ronalde's whistling, and attempted [[Impersonate|impersonations]].{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2297">[[File:Final_Position_of_Lawrence-Tan_2002.png|thumb|[[Chess]] is an example of a sequential game.]]
In [[game theory]], a '''sequential game''' is a game where one player chooses their action before the others choose theirs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~brocas/Research/simseq.pdf http://www-bcf.usc.edu] The Path to Equilibrium in Sequential and Simultaneous Games (Brocas, Carrillo, Sachdeva; 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; Importantly, the later players must have some information of the first's choice, otherwise the difference in time would have no strategic effect. Sequential games hence are governed by the time axis, and represented in the form of decision trees.

Unlike sequential games, [[simultaneous game]]s do not have a time axis as players choose their moves without being sure of the other's, and are usually represented in the form of payoff matrices. [[Extensive form game|Extensive form]] representations are usually used for sequential games, since they explicitly illustrate the sequential aspects of a game. [[Combinatorial game]]s are usually sequential games.

Games such as [[chess]], [[infinite chess]], [[backgammon]], [[tic-tac-toe]] and [[go (board game)|Go]] are examples of sequential games. The size of the decision trees can vary according to [[game complexity]], ranging from the small [[game tree]] of tic-tac-toe, to an immensely complex game tree of chess so large that even computers cannot map it completely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = [[Claude Shannon]] | title = Programming a Computer for Playing Chess | journal = Philosophical Magazine | volume = 41 | issue = 314 | year = 1950 | url = http://archive.computerhistory.org/projects/chess/related_materials/text/2-0%20and%202-1.Programming_a_computer_for_playing_chess.shannon/2-0%20and%202-1.Programming_a_computer_for_playing_chess.shannon.062303002.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In sequential games with [[perfect information]], a [[subgame perfect equilibrium]] can be found by [[backward induction]].{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

'''Shinjū''' (心中, the characters for "mind" and "centre") means "double suicide" in Japanese, as in ''[[The Love Suicides at Amijima|Shinjū Ten no Amijima]]'' (''The Love Suicides at Amijima''), written by the seventeenth-century tragedian [[Chikamatsu Monzaemon]] for the puppet theatre (''[[bunraku]]'' and/or ''[[Jōruri (music)|joruri]]'' theatre). In common parlance shinjū is used to refer to any group suicide of persons bound by love, typically lovers, parents and children, and even whole families.  In Japanese theatre and literary tradition, double suicides are the simultaneous suicides of two lovers whose ''ninjo,'' "personal feelings", or love for one another are at odds with [[Giri (Japanese)|''giri'']], "social conventions" or familial obligations. Double suicides were rather common in Japan throughout history and double suicide is an important theme of the puppet theatre repertory.  The tragic denouement is usually known to the audience and is preceded by a ''[[michiyuki]],'' a small poetical journey, where lovers evoke  the happier moments of their lives and their attempts at loving each other.

Lovers committing double suicide believed that they would be united again in heaven, a view supported by feudal teaching in Edo period Japan, which taught that the bond between husband and wife is continued into the next world,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ibsensociety.liu.edu/conferencepapers/mori.pdf{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Mitsuya MORI(2004) "Double Suicide at Rosmersholm"&lt;/ref&gt; and by the teaching of [[Pure Land Buddhism]] wherein it is believed that through double suicide, one can approach rebirth in the [[Pure Land]].&lt;ref&gt;http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-PHIL/becker.htm
 Carl B. Becker (1990) Buddhist Views of Suicide and Euthanasia, ''Philosophy East and West'', V. 40 No. 4 (October 1990) pp. 543-555, University of Hawaii Press&lt;/ref&gt;

The filmmaker [[Masahiro Shinoda]] adapted the [[bunraku|puppet theatre play]] ''Shinjū ten no Amijima'' as a film in 1969, released under the title: ''[[Double Suicide]]'' in English, in a modernist adaptation, including a score by [[Toru Takemitsu]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0064975/&lt;/ref&gt;

In the preface he wrote for [[Donald Keene]]'s book ''Bunraku'', the writer [[Jun'ichirō Tanizaki]] complained about the too-long endings of all the double suicide plays, since it is a known denouement. In his novel ''[[Some Prefer Nettles]]'', he parodies the notion of shinjū and gives it a social and sensual double suicide with no clear ending.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}

'''Soft Ices''' is an arts project by the artist [[Mark Storer]] and composer [[Jules Maxwell]]. Mark and Jules have been travelling around [[Jaywick]] in an [[ice cream van]], which has been given a new lease of life as a [[recording studio]], persuading local people to literally ‘sing for their supper’. In return for their songs, they are rewarded with free ice creams. Samples of their songs will be transformed into a piece of music which will be broadcast at the Tower’s opening. All those who recorded a song will be invited to collect their book, and anyone else who attends the event will also receive a book.

==Description==
From the [[Jaywick Martello Tower]] one hundred red ribbons, held by children, flutter from the rooftop to the ground, where they are pegged down. On the roof, there is another tower, a gift, a box full of books. Encased in the books a CD lies. The [[Martello Tower]] is like a giant [[Maypole]], around its base ''Carolina'' the ice cream van circles around and around, in a clockwise direction. From the ice cream van, haunting music is heard. Hundreds of peoples voices, fragments of songs, lullabies float out into the sky. We all wait, watching. From some distance away the strange, yet beautiful melody is interrupted by the hum of a small plane. The plane flies into view and heads in the direction of the Tower, training a brightly coloured banner. As it approaches it begins to circle anticlockwise. Seven times it circumscribes the Tower. On its seventh circuit confetti falls from the plane showering the Tower and the ground below. The ribbons are released and flutter to the ground. The sound from Carolina grows in intensity. This magical opening of the Tower on 17 September 2005 was the culmination of a year-long art project, Soft Ices.

A '''sourcebook''' is a collection of writings on a subject that is intended to be a basic introduction to the topic.

==Academic use==
In American universities, a sourcebook, either a standard one or a custom collection, may function as a supplement or replacement for a [[textbook]].

In American law schools, [[casebook]]s are similar to sourcebooks, offering selections of legal cases and commentary, forming the basis for analysis and discussion.

==Games==
In games a ''sourcebook'' is a publication intended to supplement the core materials of a [[Game|gaming]] product.  Sourcebooks are most commonly used to complement [[role-playing games]] and some [[tabletop game|tabletop]] or [[wargaming]] series, and often contain optional rules, scenarios, or other materials that players can use to extend or enhance the central game.  The term tends to refer to an overall expansion, while the related [[splatbook]] focuses on a specific fictional aspect of the game in depth.

Popular gaming series with many sourcebooks include:
* ''[[BattleTech]]''
* ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]''
* ''[[Shadowrun]]''

==Examples==

*The regulations of the [[Financial Services Authority]]. The [http://fsahandbook.info/FSA/html/handbook/ FSA Handbook] contains many sourcebooks for different aspects of its regulation, for instance its rules on conduct of business for investment firms, the Conduct of Business Sourcebook ('COBS')

'''''Stretch Screamers''''' was a series of electronic toys by [[Manley Toys Limited]] of [[Hong Kong]].

==Design==
"Stretch Screamers" could be stretched, causing them to scream. They also were able to be squeezed and balls of colored liquid would pop out. Some models had gel inside the rubber, and others had liquid and floating objects.

At one point in the early 2000s, the toys were quite popular, so much so that they had their own [[McDonald's]] [[Happy Meal]] toy line in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.millionaireplayboy.com/toys/mcstretch.php&lt;/ref&gt; However, they have since fallen into obscurity and have been discontinued and have been known to fetch high prices online.&lt;ref&gt;http://coolandcollected.com/yard-sale-finds-stretch-wolfman-dungeon-dice-and-pogs/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Glory of Christmas''''' was an annual musical performance of the story of the birth of [[Jesus]] performed between 1981 and 2009 at [[Christmas]]time in the [[Crystal Cathedral]] in [[Garden Grove, California]]. The show was cancelled&lt;ref&gt;http://m.ocregister.com/news/-280546--.html&lt;/ref&gt; from 2010 on after the church filed for bankruptcy,&lt;ref&gt;http://abcnews.go.com/Business/MellodyHobson/crystal-cathedral-files-bankruptcy/story?id=11928466&lt;/ref&gt; following the cancellation&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ocregister.com/articles/church-231897-cuts-stilwell.html?pic=1&lt;/ref&gt; earlier that year of a related show, '''''The Glory of Easter'''''.

==History==

In 1980 the Crystal Cathedral was dedicated. In 1981, ''The Glory of Christmas'' premiered at the Cathedral.

The Cathedral seated 2,736 for church services, but only seated 2,508 when holding the enormous Glory of Christmas set.

Installing the production set took a month of preparation-including lighting load-in, angel track installation and rigging, as well as set construction.

Eight angels flew throughout both productions. Some flew as high as 80-feet and were able to tracel as fast as 25 miles per hour.

The Cathedral's pipe organ has 287 ranks of pipes, 16,000 individual, 549 horizontal trumpet pipes in the East and West Balconies and 5,000 additional pipes in the South Balcony division, making it the largest collection of such pipes in the world.

More than 300 volunteers dedicated over 160 hours each to The Glory of Christmas as both cast members and volunteer ushers.

Animals played an integral role in the production's recreation of the ancient land. Attendees who watched ''The Glory of Christmas'' were able to see three adult camels and a baby, six horses, a yak, a llama, a baby water buffalo and many sheep and goats.

==Performance style==
The performance is done in the style of traditional Christmas pageants done each year at many churches, but on a grand scale that straddles the quality and feel of a [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] show.  The elaborate costumes such as those of Roman [[centurion]]s or the [[Three Wise Men]] are professionally designed and produced.  The musical numbers include popular Christmas music such as "[[O Holy Night]]", "[[Silent Night]]", and "Mary Did You Know?", and feature elaborate orchestral accompaniment.  The vocal style of the performances range from operatic to gospel.

==Special effects==
The performance features live animals, such as camels, horses, sheep, and goats. Angels, as many as seven at once, "fly" on a high-speed flying gantry and a high-volume smoke-machine (used to generate a notably convincing storm-cloud twenty feet above the audience).

Perhaps the most impressive effect is the departure of the angels.  In each scene that involves angels, they exit in a rapid flight to the farthest and highest points in the Crystal Cathedral (each some 150&amp;nbsp;ft. from the center of the audience and roughy 90&amp;nbsp;ft. above the floor)

==Ballet==
Throughout the performance, dancers perform beautiful ballet-type movements and various interpretive dance choreography.

==Recordings==
The 1993 production, directed by Paul David Dunn, was recorded and exists in tape and disc form.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amazon.com/Glory-Christmas-Crystal-Cathedral/dp/B0037ZLKWC&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Man in Grey''''' by [[Baroness Orczy]], author of ''[[The Scarlet Pimpernel]]'', was first published in 1918. This time Orczy sets the action in post-revolutionary France.

The book takes the form of a novel but is divided up into nine inter-connected short stories about the mysterious Man in Grey's adventures in tracking down Royalist criminals for the Government.

==Plot summary==
Set in Napoleonic France in 1809, the west of the country is being terrorised by a group of reckless criminals known as "[[Chouans]]" (Screech Owls) because they inflict terror by night and go to ground during the day, hiding out in the remains of chateaux left in ruins after the revolution.

The group, which contains some of France's most historic names, commit their crimes under the guise of Royalist convictions, but whether they really seek to reinstate the Bourbon royal line, or whether they are just a pack of lawless brigands is open for debate.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
''"Theirs were the hands that struck whilst their leaders planned—they were the screech-owls who for more than twenty years terrorised the western provinces of France and, in the name of God and their King, committed every crime that could besmirch the Cause which they professed to uphold."''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

They are as much an enigma as the one man who has succeeded in bringing some of these fugitives to justice, a mysterious figure known only as "The Man in Grey", who is a secret agent for the Government.

==The Stories==

===Silver-Leg===
The man in Grey has come to [[Alençon]] as the secret agent of His Imperial Majesty's Police, tasked with tracking down a band of [[Chouans]] who have been terrorising the region. On the way, the coach he is on is attached and robbed by the group of brigands whose leader is a one-legged man known as "Silver-leg".

The man in grey follows the robbers to their den and observes them bickering over the money. Their leader threatens to turn the others in to the police if they cause trouble, and escapes with the loot after telling them how to find out where their share will be buried.

After making his way into town, the man in grey presents himself to the local authorities with a letter from the Chief of Police, insisting that they give him every assistance in carrying out his duties. M. de Saint-Tropèze, who is M. le Procureur Impérial, is not happy at the intrusion by the secret agent and complains to anyone who will listen that it is unwanted and unnecessary interference.

The Man in Grey, who gives his name only as "Fernand" insists on being told about seemingly unconnected burglary and murder which happened the day before, despite M. de Saint-Tropèze insisting they are nothing to do with the Chouans. From there he starts to piece together what has happened despite the local police deliberately keeping information from him.

When Silver-leg informs on the other gang members as revenge for their insubordination, the Man in Grey takes the opportunity to wait where the cash has been buried until they try to get their own back on their leader.

Eventually Silver-leg appears with a shovel, but to the amazement of the two Chouans who are lying in wait for him, he removes his wooden leg and straightens out a perfectly normal leg in its place. They fall on him and shoot him, after which the Man in Grey shoots them.

The infamous Silver-leg turns out to be no other than M. le Procureur Impérial, and as a result, the truth has to be covered up for the good of the government, as the public cannot be allowed to know that such a high-profile authority figure was involved in such villanies.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
''For the sake of officialdom, of the government of the new Empire, the memory of such a man as M. de Sant-Tropèze must remain for ever untarnished.''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr width=100%&gt;

===The Spaniard===
November 1809 and the public have been told that the man with the wooden leg is still at large while M. le Procureur Impérial died a hero's death helping to capture a gang of Chouans.

There is widespread public condemnation about the Police's ineptitude in the affair, which isn't helped when one of their main detractors, M. de Kerblay, a lawyer and member of the Senate, is robbed at gunpoint in his house in [[Alençon]].

The Chouans take 20000 francs in the raid, but M. de Kerblay is more upset about the theft of a diamond ring given to him by the emperor and offers a reward of 5000 francs for its return.

The Chief Commissionary of Police, M. Lefèvre, is excited by the reward and is keen to do business with a one-eyed informer who turns up a week later, promising to lead the police to the leader of the gang in return for immunity and money.

The man in grey forbids Lefèvre from paying the informer, but he won't speak without cash, so Lefèvre decides to give him 2000 francs of his own money. In return the informer tells the Chief Commissionary that the leader "The Spaniard" is meeting with a German Jew at Chéron's farm that evening to dispose of the ring.

Neglecting to tell the secret agent what he has found out, M. Lefèvre takes a squadron of police to the farm after dark, but despite being shot at, inside the farm house all they find are four members of Chéron's family who have been tied up in the loft. The chouans having left several hours earlier.

M. Lefèvre returns to find the Man in Grey waiting for him. He berates the Commissionary for nearly ruining everything and insists they go straight back to the farm with ten men. They arrive about 5am and the Man in Grey orders the police to wait until they hear a shot. He then heads off in the direction of the farm house, and once out of sight, removes his grey cloak and hat to reveal his disguise – the shabby clothing of a beggar.

The man in grey bursts into the farm house to find a group of chouans, he tells them he has been sent to warn them that the police are coming; they fall for his story and start to get back into their earlier disguise, as members of the missing farmer's family. In their midst is a short dark woman with a Spanish accent, as she hides something in the chimney, the Man in Grey realises that is the mysterious "Spaniard" who stands before him now, but the Spaniard is a woman.

Seeing the Man in Grey looking at her, the Spaniard realises than he is not what he seems and draws a pistol, but he manages to escape before he is shot and the sound of gun fire alerts the police who arrest the gang.

&lt;hr width=100%&gt;

===The Mystery of Marie Valliant===
Following the capture of the Spaniard, Lefèvre finally realises that The Man in Grey is very astute, and from then on give him his complete allegiance – to the extent that when M. Leblanc, sous-préfet of Bourg-le-Roi, has serious concerns about the behaviour of his children's governess, it is the commissary who advises him to ask for assistance from the mysterious personage who enjoys the special confidence and favour of M. le Due d'Otrante himself.

So it follows that around the end of November 1809, M. Leblanc arrives at The Man in Grey's lodgings in [[Alençon]]. Leblanc lives with his wife and two children at a house called Les Colombiers, near Bourg-le-Roi. It is an old Manor, which once belonged to the exiled Comtes de Mamers, who emigrated at the outset of the Revolution and has settled in England.

Leblanc employed a [[governess]], Marie Vaillant for his children, Adèle (14), and Ernest (12), the previous summer. The governess was recommended by Monseigneur the Constitutional Bishop of Alençon but it is her recent conduct which is concerning him.

A young, pretty woman, Marie soon gains the love of the children and seemed to be perfect for the job, but recently Mademoiselle Vaillant had changed, flirting outrageously with every man she comes across. In particular, she has turned the head of their butler Lavernay, but despite both of them assuring their employers they would be discreet, within a couple of weeks they had been spotted together on clandestine meetings after dark.

Madame Leblanc had then decided that she must get rid of the girl, though had relented to allow her to stay until the end of the month, unless any further indiscretions came to her attention. The governess had since been exemplary in her behaviour, but M. Leblanc still did not trust her, especially as she seems to have an un-natural hold over his son Ernest, who worships her.

The Man in Grey listens carefully then dismisses Leblanc, telling him to go home and watch over his family carefully as his son may be in danger, but to return if there are any developments.

It is not long before M. Leblanc is back, this time in distress, for his son has gone missing following his wife's final dismissal of the governess. Meanwhile, Marie Vaillant has returned to the family home, soaking wet and in some distress, only to lock herself in her employers' bedroom before they could find out what has gone on.

After asking some questions, the Man in Grey directs them to the ruins of a neighbouring house at Saut-de-Biche where they find the body of the butler and eventually rescues the missing child, who has collapsed in a hidden tunnel between the two houses.

It turns out that Marie Vaillant had been sent by the Royalist faction to secure the treasure hidden by the Comte de Mamers in one of the lurking-holes of Les Colombiers. Unable to secure access to the tunnel by herself, she first enlisted the help of the butler and then of Ernest.
&lt;hr size=100%&gt;

===The Emeralds of Mademoiselle Philippa===
The de Romaines, who left France at the very outset of the Revolution, have recently returned from England and made their home in the tumbledown lodge just outside St. Lô.

It is the invalid Mme. la Comtesse, now a widow, who has returned to Torteron along with M. le Comte Jacques, her son, and Mademoiselle Mariette, her daughter, neither of whom has spent any time in France. The last 19 years have not been kind to Mme, and these days she is waited on by her only daughter while her son enjoys the good life, devoting his entire attention to Mademoiselle Philippa, a dancer.

The Man in Grey has instructed M. Moulin, the préfet, to keep a close eye on the émigrés, but they appear to have no connection with the [[Chouans]], so Moulin is somewhat surprised when the agent declares that his staff will be watching the family from now on.

Soon after, Mademoiselle Mariette comes to see Monsieur le Commissaire because her brother has disappeared in mysterious circumstances. The Man in Grey sends for Mademoiselle Philippa and when she arrives it becomes apparent that the rogue has run off with her emeralds: A necklace, tiara and earrings which were a gift from the Emperor of Russia and worth the best part of a million francs. She has not seen Jacques in two days, when he left her taking the jewels under the guise of showing them to his mother.

The Man in Grey insists that the sister is lying for he saw Jacques enter the house, yet he also fails to discover anything suspicious in the Lodge and after three hours' persistent search, is forced to confess that he is baffled. Suspicion over the disappearance soon turns on the mysterious secret agent and he also disappears.

A month later and there is still no news of either M. le Comte or the Man in Grey. Mme. la Comtesse announces her intentions to move to Italy with her daughter. The morning they are due to leave, Mariette goes to church where she is first approached by a verger, who passes her a bulky bundle, and then a workman who warns her not to leave yet, as there are police spies outside. She follows him to a safe room in the church and sends for her mother.

It soon becomes obvious that Mme. is not the invalid she makes out to be and the two women don disguises for their journey. Mme la Comtesse puts on the clothes of a young man but when Philippa turns up unexpectedly with the Man in Grey, it soon becomes clear that Jacques and his mother are one and the same.

Despite having her jewels returned, the dancer is horrified at the trick that has been played upon her, meanwhile the de Romaines—mother and daughter—are taken to [[Rennes]], where they are tried and imprisoned.

&lt;hr width=100%&gt;

===The Bourbon Prince===
M. Moulin, is meeting with [[Monseigneur]] the Constitutional Bishop of [[Alençon]] after hearing rumours that the Comte d'Artois, brother to the [[Louis XVIII|uncrowned King of France]], is planning to land in [[Normandy]]. Moulin is despairing about the situation having overheard a group of [[Chouans]] talking about how an enthusiastic army would meet the Prince and sweep the [[Napoleon I of France|upstart Emperor]] from his throne.

The Bishop appears bored with the matter, for Moulin has been bending his ear for over an hour. Insisting it doesn't concern him, he dismisses the Préfet, suggesting that the Man in Grey can handle the matter. Once M. Moulin has left, the Bishop waits until after dark then opens the tall windows in his room and welcomes in the Comte d'Artois, who is dishevelled after his rough sea journey. The Prince, who is in France at the invitation of the Bishop is concerned that he has been followed by spies.

Leaving the Prince in his apartment with instructions on how to access to a hiding place behind a secret panel, the Bishop meets with his [[valet]], Sébastien, who had led the Prince to the Bishop's private château. Sébastien tells him that the town is bristling with spies and that he had mistakenly shot and killed Grand-Cerf, one of the Bishop's keepers, in mistake for a spy. The Bishop starts to worry about the Man in Grey, who has already foiled several Chouan plots.

Several hours later the Man in Grey meets M. Moulin to discuss the situation. Moulin confirms that the Comte d'Artois has landed but is shocked to hear that he was met by the Bishop's valet – insisting that the Bishop's loyalty is beyond question. The Man in Grey is not convinced and insists that the château is searched immediately.

M. Fantin, commissary of police of Granville is agitated at having to carry out the Man in Grey's orders in what he sees as an abominable insult to the Bishop. yet, even when news reaches the police that a thief has been killed at the château during a robbery attempt that evening, the Man in Grey refuses to back down and announces he will meet the commissary and his squadron at the château.

When they get there they find a body burnt beyond recognition, the Man in Grey questions Sébastien who reports that the rascal had overturned a lamp, was burned to death and nearly set fire to the château in the process. M. Fantin hopes the Man in Grey will drop the matter, but after asking the valet why it took so long to report the crime, he orders Fantin to make a thorough search of the château and grounds despite his protestations.

The men search the château from top to bottom, finding the secret room but no sign of the Prince. In the mean time the Monseigneur shows neither interest nor emotion, doing very little during the course of the search except accepting the ministrations of a servant who remained with him throughout, bathing his forehead with vinegar and mixing him fresh glasses of orange-flower water.

After the squadron have gone, the Bishop turns to his servant, who is none other than the Prince, and with a sigh of relief starts to tell him how lucky they have been. Their luck doesn't last long, for the Man in Grey bursts in with a squadron of Police and confronts the Bishop.

He tells the Prince that as the Emperor deprecates revenge and bloodshed he will be taken to [[Avranches]] under guard and put of the [[brig]] Delphine for an immediate return trip to England. The Bishop, resigned that the plot has failed, is told by the agent that he has 24 hours to exile himself to his estate in the South, and he should consider himself lucky nothing worse will happen to him.
&lt;hr width=100%&gt;

===The Mystery of a Woman's Heart===
Mme. de Plelan is distraught at the sudden departure of the Monseigneur. He has sent a letter to Madame warning her and her daughter Constance to destroy any compromising papers, as the police are likely to pay them a visit. Mme. de Plelan despairs about the Man in Grey, who is killing their hopes one by one, and asks if there are no men who can rid the King of such a foe.

Constance tells her mother she has come up with a plan to get rid of their enemy just as the police arrive at the house. As her mother composes herself for the police visit, Constance leaves her to return the small metal box she is carrying to its hiding place in her room.

When Constance eventually reappears, she looks somewhat different... For she has changed from her plain morning dress into a clinging gown of soft silk; her neck and arms are bare; her is done up and she is wearing makeup and perfume. The Man in Grey gives her a look of admiration, while Constance, flirting heavily, pleads for him to stop the unmarried sergeant from going through her personal belongings. Swayed by her beauty, the Man in Grey announces himself at her service and Constance drags him off to her room.

After a while Madame hears her daughter singing and goes to investigate, she finds her daughter playing the [[spinet]] while the agent gazes at her with ardent admiration. On a table at his elbow is the tin box, with its lid open. Only a few papers remain at the bottom of the box; the others he has in his hand. At the sight Madame almost faints, Constance runs to her assistance, thanking the Man in Grey for being considerate. He leaves taking the box and papers with him.

The agent gone, Constance assures her mother that there were only worthless letters in the box but announces triumphantly that she has the mysterious agent wrapped around her little finger.

Less than a month later, early February 1810, and a woman is making her way along the main road which cuts straight through the woods between [[Alençon]] and [[Plelan]]. She meets with a man she calls Blue-heart, who confirms he is ready to shoot the 'vermin'.

As Blue-heart hides in the thicket, the woman is approached by another man, who tries to take her in his arms. As they walk she talks at random, but the Man in Grey wants only to speak of the love that he now feels for her. Having received a note earlier saying that she would walk with him he is deliriously happy, too unsophisticated to wonder at Mademoiselle de Plelan's agreeing to meet with a man far beneath her in station. He is far too infatuated by this time to see any ulterior motives in this unconventional act.

After a while Constance makes her excuses and leaves him, insisting that she does not want her friend Annette to see them together. Left alone, the Agent starts to walk back towards town and into her trap.

Blue-Heart, has been joined by four other Chouans, keen to lend him a hand and as the Man in Grey approaches they grab him and are about to shoot when there is a piercing cry from nearby. The Chouans let the agent go and scurry into the undergrowth. Soon after Constance falls into his arms and he realises she has saved his life at the same time he realises that it was she who had set him up.

She pushes him away and implores him to leave before the Chouans return, insisting that their ways lie apart for they have nothing in common. At that she plunges into the undergrowth to comfort the Chouan assassin leaving the Man in Grey to mourn his foolish hopes.

&lt;hr width=100%&gt;

===The League of Knaves===
Mid February 1810 and the Man in Grey has received warning that de Livardot, one of the leaders of the [[Chouans]] has recently arrived in [[Jersey]] from England, and plans to land in France.

The [[Napoleon I of France|Emperor]] is due to visit the area in less than a month to stay with the Duc de Gisors and his imminent visit is occupying the local officials. The Man in Grey announces that he is going to meet de Livardot when he lands on French soil, leaving the prefect of [[Caen]], M. Laurens, and M. Carteret, chief commissary of the district (who are very happy to see the back of the agent) in charge of the Emperor's safety. When they show surprise that he is going alone, he tells them that if he is not back in time for the Emperor's visit they should assume that the Chouan leader has got the better of him.

A couple of weeks have passed and the local group of Chouans are wondering why they have not seen or heard from de Livardot, indeed most of them know very little about him. Blue-Heart tells them that they knew each other as children, in the days when Monsieur le Chevalier his father lived in the house, Les Acacias, which now belongs to the Duc de Gisors. Livardot has been sent from England to help because he is from the area and knows the house well.

Hearing the familiar call of the [[screech owl]], they realise that de Livardot has finally arrived. He identifies himself with a secret pass phrase and tells the other Chouans that his delay was caused by the accursed spy who jumped him at Dog's Tooth and nearly got the better of him. De Livardot goes on to tell them how, despite dislocating his knee, he eventually outmanoeuvred the agent, who fell to his death on the rocks below.

The group start to work, plotting to kill the Emperor during his stay at Les Acacias. The Chouans have stored two kilograms of gunpowder in the disused cellars under the house and they intend to blow it up tomorrow evening when the Emperor is asleep.

The next day the town is a buzz with strangers cheering on the Emperor. The celebrations last through into the early hours of the following day and it is 3am before the citizens of Caen go to bed. Half an hour later they are woken by a huge explosion – a glow lights up the horizon – Les Acacias is on fire.

In the Rue aux Juifs, the Chouans and their local supporters are waiting for news from de Livardot and Blue-heart who went to set the fuse. Convinced the Emperor is dead they start to celebrate only for Blue-heart to come rushing in, shouting that they have been betrayed, for the Emperor is still alive and Les Acacias was empty when the explosion occurred.

Finding themselves surrounded by police, the Chouans give up and are arrested, consoling themselves that at least de Livardot has escaped – that is until they spot him in the middle of a group of police officers. Thinking him arrested like the rest of them, they are even more distraught to be told that de Livardot is actually the Man in Grey, and the Chouan leader has been locked up in [[Bicêtre]] since his arrival.

===The Arrow Poison===
The Man in Grey has sent Hippolyte Darnier, a trusted servant of the republic to take an important letter, implicating the Marquis de Trevargan in the failed plot to blow up the Emperor, to the Minister of Police in Paris. Darnier takes the Paris diligence with around ten other passengers, one of who is a young woman in a dark cloak and hood. The woman who appears to be a nun spends the trip reading her book and keeps away from her fellow passengers.

When the coach stops off at a small posting inn for the night, the young woman walks into the private room where Hippolyte Darnier is having his solitary supper, telling one of the serving maids that she is travelling in his company. The next morning Darnier is found dead in his room and no trace of the young woman or the missing letter can be found anywhere.

The man in Grey concludes that Darnier has been murdered for the letter and summons the widow of the dead man to break the news to her. She takes the news badly and can shed no light on who might want to kill her husband.

M. le Marquis de Trevargan, who has previously been above suspicion, is regretting writing the letter which had fallen into the hands of the Man in Grey. The day after the death of Darnier he is visited by M. Carteret, the commissary and the Agent, who question him. The Marquis insists the letter was a forgery and challenges them to produce it so he can prove it.

Madame la Marquise is equally indignant at the aspersions being cast upon her husband. When the Man in Grey tells her that the letter has not been destroyed and that Darnier is still alive she pales noticeably and knocks over a table. Convinced he has his murderer in Madame la Marquise, the agent is thrown to find that she has a solid alibi, as she was entertaining children from the local Convent School during the day of the murder.

Hanging around the Trevargan neighbourhood at night looking for clues, the Man in Grey finds himself face to face with Madame Darnier. He walks her home and the following day summons her to the police station where he assures the sneering commissary that he is about to unmask the murderer. He advises his colleagues to keep quiet regardless of what happens and when the widow arrives he tells her that her husband is still alive, for the poison did not quite kill him. He tells her that the doctor thinks it would be good for her husband to see her immediately.

With a look of horror in her eyes, Madame Darnier, scratches her hand with the same poison she used to kill her husband (for the Man in Grey has only pretended that Darnier is still alive) and is soon beyond help.

The Man in Grey reveals that Madame Darnier was the daughter of Leclerc, a man who for years devoted himself to the fortunes of the Trevargans. He and his family are devoted heart and soul to the Marquis and his cause. His daughter going so far as to kill her husband to save the family she loved. However the Trevargans will not escape justice for long, as the agent had only sent a copy of the letter to the Minister and still has the original in his possession.

===The Last Adventure===
The Marquis de Trevargan, Blue-Heart and White-Beak, several of the [[Chouans]] who were captured following their recent attempt to assassinate the Emperor have escaped while being held at [[Evreux]]. The Man in Grey and M. Gault, the commissary of police of Evreux have been riding hard all day towards Paris, so they can inform Monsieur le Ministre of the escape in person.

Passing through [[Mantes]] after dark, the Man in Grey dismounts to see what has upset his horse – only to discover the body of a man in a ditch. The man has been murdered and his shoes are missing. M. Gault thinks they should leave the matter to the local police and is somewhat miffed when the Man in Grey insists that the commissary must remain in Mantes and await further instruction on pain of instant dismissal, while the agent continues to Paris.

After riding all night, the Man in Grey finally meets with the Minister of Police. They soon ascertain that the murdered man was Hector Duroy, a messenger sent by the minister to take an important message concerning the Emperor's movements to the Man in Grey. When the Minister realises that the Chouans have escaped and are probably the ones who killed his messenger, he is horrified at the possible consequences.

The minister comments that one of the missing Chouans had been paid to kill the Man in Grey by Constance de Plelan. As far as he is aware Constance has been staying at Evreux and, as she is Monsieur de Trevargan's niece, he suspects that she has been involved in the escape. The Man in Grey turns ashen at the mention of Constance's name but otherwise keeps his emotions in check.

The Emperor is heading towards [[Chartres]] to visit his ex-wife Josephine. He is travelling in his private [[Sedan (automobile)|berline]], harnessed with four bays, which are exceedingly swift. The Man in Grey asks for the swiftest horse from the stables and within twenty minutes Fernand is back in the saddle, all thoughts of fatigue behind him.

About a kilometre from [[Maintenon]] along the main Paris to Chartes road is an isolated inn called 'The Farmer's Paradise'. The intermittent traffic on the road means the inn is usually quiet but this afternoon there is a reasonable crowd inside. About an hour earlier a lady and a gentleman had arrived from [[Dreux]] on a hired [[chaise]], it's now 3pm and M. le Marquis de Trevargan is sitting with his niece, Constance de Plelan, at a trestle-table in a corner of the coffee-room.

The other escaped Chouans are also present, but before they discuss their plans they dump a drunkard out into the corridor, where he rolls over contentedly and settles down to sleep in the doorway. With the landlord sent away and the drunkard removed, Blue-Heart and White-Beak tell the Marquis that they have laid a trap for the Emperor by scattering nails and broken glass over the road about a km from the Inn. This will cause his horses to go lame at which point they can overpower him and shoot him with the pistol procured by Constance.

Suddenly the drunkard in the corridor is standing upright pointing a gun at them – it is the Man in Grey. He seizes Constance and forces the rebels to kneel down or he will shoot her. She pleads to them to let the agent kill her for the greater good of the Royalist cause, but they will not have a woman's blood on their hands so they wait as instructed. As time passes they hear the sound of the Emperor's coach and the murmur of voices indicating it had been held up, but still the Man in Grey keeps his pistol to Constance's head, threatening to shoot her should they make any noise at all.

Another hour goes by and through the open window the sound of the murmur of voices has given way to renewed clanking of metal chains, as the heavy travelling chaise once more starts on its way. The noises are then replaced by the sound of a number of horses galloping along at breakneck speed, as a posse of police arrive at 'The Farmer's Paradise', to arrest the rebels.

The men are all subsequently tried for the murder of the messenger and for plotting against the Emperor, for which they are condemned to penal servitude for life. Constance de Plelan however, was never brought to trial. Powerful influences were said to have saved her.

'''El Tropicana''' is a [[cabaret]] in [[Havana]], [[Cuba]]. It was launched on December 30, 1939 at the Villa Mina in [[Marianao]] and next door to [[Instituto Técnico Militar|El Colegio de Belen]] where [[Fidel Castro]] went to school. The Tropicana Cabaret is located in a lush, tropical garden six-acre (24,000 m²) estate. 

==History==
The Tropicana evolved out of a nightclub called Edén Concert, operated in the late 1930's by the late by Cuban impresario Victor de Correa. Two casino operators approached de Correa about opening a combination casino and cabaret on a property in [[Marianao]] rented from Guillermina Pérez Chaumont, known as Mina. The operators felt the tropical gardens of the Villa Mina would provide a natural setting for an outdoor cabaret. In December 1939, de Correa moved his company of singers, dancers and musicians into a converted mansion located on the estate. De Correa provided the food and entertainment, while Rafael Mascaro and Luis Bular operated the casino located in the chandeliered dining room of the estate's mansion. Originally known as El Beau Site, de Correa decided to rename it The Tropicana. With a fanfare from the [[Alfredo Brito Orchestra]] El Tropicana opened on December 30, 1939.&lt;ref name="Tropicana Nights 2005"&gt;Tropicana Nights: The Life and Times of The Legendary Cuban Nightclub by Rosa Lowinger with Ofelia Fox (Harcourt Books, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt; Martín Fox, a well-connected gambler began renting table space in the casino. Eventually by 1950 he amassed enough profits to take over the lease of what would become The Tropicana and hire [[Max Borges Jr.]] to design an expansion that would be known as ''Los Arcos de Cristal''.

[[Max Borges-Recio|Max Borges]] designed a building composed of five reinforced concrete arches and glass walls over an indoor stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ecured.cu/Max_Borges_Recio|title=Max Borges Recio|access-date=2018-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the indoor cabaret opened on March 15, 1952, it had a combined total [[seating capacity]] of 1,700 for the interior and outside areas. It's furniture designed by [[Charles and Ray Eames]]. The Arcos de Cristal won numerous international prizes when it was built and was one of six Cuban buildings included in the 1954 [[Museum of Modern Art]] exhibit entitled "Latin American Architecture since 1945." Borges won the Premio Anual, from the [[Colegio Nacional de Arquitectos de Cuba|Colegio de Arquitectos]] in 1953 for his work on the Tropicana. The Arcos de Cristal may be seen in the Tropicana scene of the movie [[Our Man in Havana (film)|Our Man In Havana]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obFPAXXeFos|title=Our Man in Havana (1959 ) Tropicana Scene - Ernie Kovacs|access-date=2018-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
