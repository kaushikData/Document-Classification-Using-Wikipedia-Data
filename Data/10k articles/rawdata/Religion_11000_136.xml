'''Acherusa''' is a lake that lies near the city of [[Jesus|Christ]], according to chapters 22 &amp;ndash; 23 of the [[Biblical canon|extracanonical]] ''[[Apocalypse of Paul]]'':
:''22 [...] And after that he took me out of that place where I saw these things, and lo, a river, and the waters of it were exceedingly white, more than milk, and I said to the [[angel]]: What is this? and he said to me: This is the Lake Acherusa where is the city of Christ: but not every man is suffered to enter into that city: for this is the way that leads to [[God]], and if any be a [[fornicator]] or ungodly, and turn and repent and bear fruits meet for repentance, first when he comes out of the body he is brought and worships God, and then by the commandment of the [[Lord]] he is delivered unto [[Michael]] the angel, and he washes him in the Lake Acherusa and so brings him in to the city of Christ with them that have done no [[sin]]. And I marveled and blessed the Lord God for all the things which I saw.

:''23 And the angel answered and said unto me: Follow me and I will bring you into the city of Christ. And he stood by Lake Acherusa, and set me in a golden ship, and angels as it were three thousand sang an [[hymn]] before me until I came even unto the city of Christ.''

Acherusa is also mentioned in the older, fragmentary work ''[[Apocalypse of Peter|The Apocalypse of Peter]]'', though in ''Peter'' it is a field, rather than a lake:

:''Then will I give unto my chosen and [[righteous]] the washing and the [[salvation]] for which they have sought me, in the field of Acherusa, which is called [[Elysium|Aneslasleja]].''

The name appears to be derived from the Greek ''akherousai'', which means "marshlike water".

The '''''Arabic Bayán''''' is a book written by the [[Báb]] around 1848. Its larger sister book is the ''[[Persian Bayán]]''. The work is incomplete, containing only eleven [[Vahid]]s. Each Vahid serves as a chapter and contains nineteen [[Abwab]]. The grammar is highly irregular.{{Elaboration needed|date=December 2016}} The work was composed while the Báb was imprisoned in [[Maku, Iran]].

==Early history==
The first mentions of the religion happened in the era when Norway was politically united with [[Sweden]]; the first mention of the [[Báb]], who Bahá'ís view as the herald to the founder of the religion, Bahá'u'lláh, was published in accounts of Persian travels in 1869, and the first mentions of [[Bahá'u'lláh]] were made in 1896.&lt;ref name="historie"/&gt;

Swedish [[Sufi]] [[Ivan Aguéli]] was able to meet [[`Abdu'l-Bahá]], in 1912 in Egypt.&lt;ref name="historie"/&gt;

===`Abdu'l-Bahá's Tablets of the Divine Plan===
The next steps in the history of the Bahá'í Faith in Norway start after the political independence of Norway from Sweden in 1905. [[`Abdu'l-Bahá]], the son of the founder of the religion, wrote a series of letters, or [[tablets (religious)|tablets]], to the followers of the religion in the [[United States]] in 1916-1917; these letters were compiled together in the book titled [[Tablets of the Divine Plan]].  The seventh of the tablets was the first to mention several countries in [[Europe]] including beyond where `Abdu'l-Bahá had visited in 1911-12 and 1912-13. Written on April 11, 1916, it was delayed in being presented in the United States until 1919 &amp;mdash; after the end of [[World War I]] and the [[Spanish flu]]. World traveling Bahá'í journalist [[Martha Root]]'s subsequently visited King [[Haakon VII of Norway]] among her many trips.&lt;ref name="gpb"&gt;{{cite book  |first=Shoghi |last=Effendi |authorlink=Shoghi Effendi |year=1944 |title=God Passes By |publisher=Bahá'í Publishing Trust |location=Wilmette, Illinois, USA |isbn=0-87743-020-9 |url=http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/se/GPB/ | pages = 388}}&lt;/ref&gt; The seventh tablet was translated and presented by [[Mirza Ahmad Sohrab]] on April 4, 1919, and published in [[Star of the West (Bahá'í magazine)|Star of the West]] magazine on December 12, 1919.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Abbas | first = 'Abdu'l-Bahá |author2=Mirza Ahmad Sohrab |author3=trans. and comments  | title = Tablets, Instructions and Words of Explanation |date=April 1919 | url = http://bahai-library.com/abdulbaha_tablets_instructions_explanation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"In brief, this world-consuming war has set such a conflagration to the hearts that no word can describe it. In all the countries of the world the longing for universal peace is taking possession of the consciousness of men. There is not a soul who does not yearn for concord and peace. A most wonderful state of receptivity is being realized.… Therefore, O ye believers of God! Show ye an effort and after this war spread ye the synopsis of the divine teachings in the British Isles, France, Germany, Austria-Hungary, Russia, Italy, Spain, Belgium, Switzerland, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Holland, Portugal, Rumania, Serbia, Montenegro, Bulgaria, Greece, Andorra, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Monaco, San Marino, Balearic Isles, Corsica, Sardinia, Sicily, Crete, Malta, Iceland, Faroe Islands, Shetland Islands, Hebrides and Orkney Islands."&lt;ref name="tablets"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Following the release of these tablets a few Bahá'ís began moving to or at least visiting countries across Europe.  August Rudd became the first Bahá'í pioneer in Scandinavia (Sweden) in 1920.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

As the religion spread across Scandinavia it reached the point where a regional National Spiritual Assembly for Norway, [[Finland]], [[Sweden]] and [[Denmark]] was established in 1957.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Hassall | first = Graham |author2=Universal House of Justice | title = National Spiritual Assemblies statistics 1923-1999 | work = Assorted Resource Tools | publisher = Bahá'í Academics Resource Library | url = http://bahai-library.com/hassall_nsas_years_formation | accessdate = 2008-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, pioneers continued to arrive from other counties—a [[Bahá'í Faith in the United Kingdom|British Bahá'í]] settled for a time in [[Spitsbergen]] in 1958 though later a Norwegian couple moved there in 1970.&lt;ref name="short"/&gt; The second Norwegian Local Spiritual Assembly formed in [[Bergen]] in 1955, and a third in [[Stavanger]] in 1960.&lt;ref name="historie"/&gt;

In 1962-3 Norway added two Local Spiritual Assemblies in [[Bergen]], and [[Hetland]], with smaller groups between one and nine adults in [[Bærum]] and [[Fana]] and isolated Bahá'ís in [[Ås, Akershus|Ås]], [[Harstad]], [[Kristiansund]], [[Laksevåg]], [[Narvik]], [[Sandefjord]], [[Sandnes]], and [[Stokmarknes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The Bahá'í Faith: 1844-1963: Information Statistical and Comparative, Including the Achievements of the Ten Year International Bahá'í Teaching &amp; Consolidation Plan 1953-1963 | publisher = [[Hand of the Cause|Hands of the Cause]] Residing in the Holy Land | year = 1963  | location = Haifa, Israel | pages = 22 and 46 | url = http://bahai-library.com/handscause_statistics_1953-63&amp;chapter=1#22 | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Worldwide in 1979 there were 129 officially recognized Bahá'í socio-economic development projects. By 1987, the number of officially recognized development projects had increased to 1482. The National Spiritual Assembly of Norway established an institution—the Norwegian Agency for International Development Cooperation—and in 1988 it began a working relationship with India's [[New Era Development Institute]] (see [[New Era High School]]), with support for a two-year rural community development program. In 1989, funding was extended to cover a one-year community development facilitators course and short courses on agriculture, rural technology, literacy, and domestic science.&lt;ref name="involve"&gt;{{cite web | last = Hansen | first = Holly  |author2=Bahá'í International Community | title = Overview of Bahá'í Social and Economic Development | work = 1992-93 edition of ''The Bahá'í World'', pp. 229-245. | publisher = Universal House of Justice | year = 1999 | url =http://info.bahai.org/article-1-8-1-6.html | accessdate = 2008-04-27| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080411185732/http://info.bahai.org/article-1-8-1-6.html| archivedate= 11 April 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; But controversy has also served to focus the efforts of the community. In 1983 the [[Universal House of Justice]], current elected head of the religion, addressed a letter to the National Assembly of the Bahá'ís of Norway concerning practices of [[meditation]]—it appears many Norwegian Bahá'ís were particularly attracted to the practice but had differences of opinion about the place and practice of meditation. In an attempt to start "a campaign of spiritualization of the Bahá'í community" called for by the House of Justice, a committee in Norway had established a meditation class at a summer school that offered one particular method. Observing that as Bahá'u'lláh had not outlined any method of mediation, the House of Justice cautioned that any private personal choice on a method of meditation should not be institutionalized or mandated. The House of Justice elaborated that the community was struggling with the regrettable atmosphere of appalling suffering brought on by religions in the past -that there had arisen a kind of revulsion of various kinds of personal and public spiritual practices of religion that the Bahá'í Faith nevertheless does stress and outlined them as follows:

*The recital each day of one of the [[Obligatory Bahá'í prayers]] with pure-hearted devotion.
*The regular reading of the [[Bahá'í literature#Bibliography#Authoritative|Sacred Scriptures]], specifically at least each morning and evening, with reverence, attention and thought.
*Prayerful meditation on the [[Bahá'í teachings]], so that we may understand them more deeply, fulfil them more faithfully, and convey them more accurately to others.
*Striving every day to bring our behaviour more into accordance with the high standards that are set forth in these teachings.
*[[Religious conversion#Conversion to the Bahá'í Faith|''Teaching'']] the religion.
*[[Altruism|Selfless]] service in the work of the religion and in the carrying on of our [[trade]] or [[profession]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Commissioned by the [[Oslo Philharmonic Orchestra]] on the occasion of its 75th jubilee, the symphony consists of two parts, "Fragrances of Mercy" and "Circumambulations." The rhythm of saying "Allah'u'Abha" ("God the All-Glorious") is inherent in the work, which is based on the [[Bahá'u'lláh]]'s [[Tablet of Carmel]].

'''Bishmizzine''' ({{lang-ar|بشمزين}}), or '''Bishmezzine''', '''Bechmezzine''', '''Beshmizzine''', '''Bishmezzine''', is a village in the [[Koura District|Koura]] district of the [[North Governorate, Lebanon|North Governorate]] of [[Lebanon]]. It is about 275 meters above [[sea level]]. Bishmizzine borders the villages of Afisdeeq, Kfar-Hazir, [[Amyoun]], Fi', and B'terram.

==History==

===People===
Bishmizzine is known for its export of intellectuals. The genetic lineage is mixed as is the whole of Lebanon. The inhabitants are representative of the Lebanese genetic pool comprising mainly Arab and Mediterranean people. The people are friendly, educated and hospitable.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}

===Religious Diversity===
The people are  [[Greek Orthodox Christianity in Lebanon|Greek Orthodox]] and other confessions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Municipal and ikhtiyariah elections in Northern Lebanon |url=http://www.localiban.org/IMG/pdf/iiMonthly-Municip-Mar10-E92.pdf |publisher=The Monthly |accessdate=29 October 2016 |page=22 |date=March 2010 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160603040803/http://www.localiban.org/IMG/pdf/iiMonthly-Municip-Mar10-E92.pdf |archivedate=3 June 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
There is a minority of [[Sunni Islam in Lebanon|Sunni Muslims]]. There are several historical churches and a [[mosque]] and local shrines throughout the village.  In addition, there are also residents of other Christian sects, such as [[Maronite Christianity in Lebanon|Maronite]] and [[Protestantism in Lebanon|Protestant]]. All places of worship are located near the village center.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}

==Geography==

===Environmental Features===
Bishmizzine rests in the middle of the Koura plain, probably one of the largest uninterrupted olive groves in the world. It is bordered by hills and thus winter rain flows in water ways down to the town. The village rests on a large aquifer and this underground water body partially explains the extremes in climate when compared to neighbouring villages. For example, thin ice develops overnight in winter while it does not in neighbouring villages. At night the temperature may differ by 5 to 7 degrees C lower than the nearby adjacent surrounding hills or neighboring villages. Another factor that may play a role in explaining this climate conundrum is the fact that Bishmizzine rests in the plain at the base of the Western Lebanese Range of mountains and is surrounded by hills which act to trap any cold air that may flow by convection down the range from as high up as the Cedars of Lebanon in Bcharre. Hence there was a climatology station for the government in the village that utilized the temperature of the plain at 4 to 5 am before sunrise in an equation to arbitrarily calculate the temperature at the top of the mountain range. In the old days this environmental phenomena was counteracted by a pine forest that used to blockade the cold night air advancing down the mountain slopes towards the town. Remnants of this pine forest remain to this day and act as a picnic zone visited by many. The argylls soil in Bishmizzine has been sought after by cement factories that find its characteristics favorable for quality cement production. This has been a blessing and a curse at the same time. The blessing is obviously financial for the land owner and jobs created in the nearby cement factories however the environmental impact has been catastrophic. Huge deep excavation areas emptied of soil remained after the removal of the soil. These areas then filled up with rain water during the winter and resulted in a swamp/wetland like environment with rising humidity. The damp environment as well as soil erosion have rendered the surrounding area susceptible to fungal diseases ex olive leaf spot or peacock eye spot ''Spilocea oleaginea '' which infested initially the area around the excavations and then spread to involve the surrounding olive fields rendering the once productive olive groves unproductive. This disease now infests olives in an area up to 4&amp;nbsp;km away from the epicenter. Noteworthy is the recent natural transformation of these excavation sites from a swamp to a wetland habitat with flora and fauna uncharacteristic of Lebanon. This transformation has recently stopped soil erosion and stabilized the habitat. Also this phenomenon has become a source of inquiry for botanists curious as to where some of the atypical flora came from ex. reeds characteristic of the Nile or Danube. Since Bishmizzine lies on the route of migratory birds some experts have postulated that the water holes became a rest area for migrating birds ex storks and hence the seeds were carried in their feathers from distant areas. The disease burden of fungal olive disease peacock eye remains high however and a concerted effort by farmers, government and NGOs is needed. A large area of Bishmizzine remains free of fungal disease and produces some of the best extra virgin olive oil and table olives in the area.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}

===Climate===
The climate of Bishmizzine is characterized by a dry-summer [[subtropical]] [[Mediterranean climate]], and thus has moderate weather throughout the seasons. Summers are hot and dry, while winters are rainy with occasional light snow.

===Utilities===
Electricity is supplied by the grid from the concessions of Quadisha electric company part of Electricité du Lebanon (EDL). There is a privately owned diesel generator which supplies the village in the event of power shortage. Also many villagers own their own generator. Water is supplied through a deep well tapping the underground aquifer and maintained by regular fees paid by the villagers. Waste management is mainly through underground waste pools, though a system of waste collection has been partly laid out as part of the plan to collect the waste of the region in a waste management plant. Telephones exist in nearly every house as well as low speed internet access. Wireless coverage is excellent and covers all the Bishmizzine area.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}

Previously almonds were produced in commercial quantity but have been wiped out by an almond virus 25 years ago and have not been replanted also wild scented roses were produced in large quantity and a factory for rose essence existed but is no longer. Oak trees grow sporadically in the fields and are used for biofuels. Livestock consist of a small dairy farm and few poultry farms. The main experimental farm for the Koura Development Council is situated in Bishmizzine and is the site of several educational lectures and events for the farmers and Koura intellectuals.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}

===Tourism===
Relies mostly on global immigrants from the village returning for the holidays whether from the Lebanese cities or from abroad. The financial return is negligible and never truly exploited. The presence of some buildings of architectural beauty built hundreds of years ago has been an attraction for university scholars. The water collection systems and wells built also hundreds of years ago has been neglected but some remain to this day. The pine forest is a source of small scale local outings. The four ancient churches are visited on a small scale by the locals or scouts camping nearby or for prayer on the patron saint's day. One church, Virgin Mary, in the middle of the old village dates back to the crusader era. Recently outings and festivals to gather the villagers have been arranged. Shops that sell refreshments, ice-cream and snacks exist for the tourists that pass through on their way to major tourist destinations ex. Balamand Monastery or University, Bsharre Cedars, Ehden or Zghourta.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}

==Transportation==

===Roads===
Easily accessible from the main highway (Autostrade Al Arz) passing in neighbouring Kfarhazir and Amioun (Cedar highway). The roads are satisfactory and well maintained by the municipality. The road through town leads either to Balamand University through Afsdik, Fih and Qulhat or to Zghourta/ Tripoli through Btouram and Abaa. Also the old Cedar road remains which connects Bishmizzine to Amioun and the new highway.
Many agricultural routes through the olive groves and fields are a source of pleasure to the hiker.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}

The Red cross based in nearby Amioun provides free EMS service ex. patient first aid and transportation.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}

==Global Emigration==
One of the many Lebanese villages where the number of inhabitants is a speck compared to the number of villagers abroad. Global emigration occurred as far back as the mid 19th century with records showing young men and families migrating to the new world mainly Australia and the Americas (North and South). This emigration was greatly hastened after the economic ill fortunes of the silk textile factories after the advent of cheap artificial silk by the far east. The economy in the mid to late 19th century relied heavily on silkworms and silk spinning and weaving with at least 5 large factories in Bishmizzine alone each sustaining at least 40 workers. The first world war also took its toll and the civil war and its repercussions. The emigration continues till the present day. Some families are extinct and others are greatly reduced in number. However, in the diaspora, if you visit any major city or town especially in Brazil, Argentina, Australia, or the USA you will almost certainly find someone whose ancestors come from this village. During holidays, especially summer, many of the empty houses are joyfully cleaned and return to life with visiting families.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}

===Sports===
There is a playground maintained by a local club where volleyball matches are held. Once a year in summer a volleyball tournament is organized and many teams participate. This event is attended by many fans from neighboring villages and by many villagers living abroad who happen to visit their loved ones for the summer vacation. Also there is a private tennis club with 3 playgrounds and night illumination and a tennis coach capable of providing private lessons. The excavations by cement factories in the plain have left ditches that are adored by those that like extreme driving with four wheel drive vehicles or offroad motor bikes through the challenging terrain. In addition there is a private club with auditorium where dancing lessons and other activities are provided. Horse back riding is also possible at a ranch. Hiking through the olive groves and fields is a popular sport for many visitors. In addition Bichmezzine volleyball team are the champions in all of Koura district.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}

'''Bochasanwasi Akshar Purushottam Sanstha''' ('''BAPS''') ([[IAST]]: ''{{IAST|Bocāsanvāsī Akshar Purushottam Sansthā}}''), is a [[Hindu]] religious and social organization within the [[Swaminarayan faith|Swaminarayan branch of Hinduism]]. BAPS was established on 5 June 1907 by [[Shastriji Maharaj]] after leaving the [[Laxmi Narayan Dev Gadi|Vadtal Gadi]] of the [[Swaminarayan Sampraday]].  It was formed on the founder's interpretation that [[Swaminarayan]] was to remain present on earth through a lineage of [[Guru|Gunatit Gurus]] or [[Akshar Purushottam Upasana|Akshar]] dating all the way back to [[Gunatitanand Swami]] -  one of Swaminarayan's prominent devotees.&lt;ref name="Williams2001"&gt;{{cite book|title=An Introduction to Swaminarayan Hinduism|last=Williams|first=Raymond|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2001|isbn=0-521-65279-0|location=New York|pages=106|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|55}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rinehart|first1=Robin|title=Contemporary Hinduism: Ritual, Culture, and Practice|date=2004|publisher=Library of Congress|isbn=1-57607-905-8|page=215}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gunatitanand Swami]] was succeeded by [[Bhagatji Maharaj]], [[Shastriji Maharaj]], [[Yogiji Maharaj]], [[Pramukh Swami Maharaj]] and [[Mahant Swami Maharaj]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.baps.org/Announcement/2016/Final-Darshan-and-Rites-of-Pramukh-Swami-Maharaj-9961.aspx|title=Final Darshan and Rites of Pramukh Swami Maharaj|website=BAPS Swaminarayan Sanstha|access-date=2016-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the organizational emphasis on the [[Akshar Purushottam Upasana|Akshar Purushottam]] doctrine, it essentially forms the organization's middle name. The fundamental beliefs of BAPS include the spiritual guidance through the living Akshar or Guru who is believed to have attained oneness with Swaminarayan. [[Mahant Swami Maharaj]] is the current Guru and the president of the organization.

As a global well established [[Hindu]] organization, BAPS actively engages in a range of endeavors aimed at spirituality, character-building, and human welfare. The activities span religious, cultural, social, and humanitarian domains.  Through these activities, it aims to preserve Indian culture, ideals of [[Hinduism|Hindu faith]], family unity, selfless service, interfaith harmony and peaceful coexistence. 55,000 volunteers and 3,300 temples serve 3,300 communities around the world. As of August 2018 the BAPS has approximately 1,560 saints or Sadhus, among the most saints in one sanstha in Hinduism. 
 
As part of its efforts towards community outreach, BAPS also engages in a host of humanitarian and charitable endeavors, by which its volunteers serve neighbors and communities.  Through the BAPS Charities [[nonprofit organization|non-profit aid organization]], With total assets valued approximately at 2.23 lakh crore INR roughly 30.7 billion USD in 2018 the BAPS has spearheaded a number of projects around the world in the arenas of healthcare, education, environmental causes, and community-building campaigns.

==Mandirs==
[[File:DSC09917 BAPS Temple - E view by Volkan Yuksel.jpg|300px|left|thumb|[[BAPS Shri Swaminarayan Mandir Atlanta|BAPS Swaminarayan Mandir]] [[Atlanta]]]]
The [[mandir]], known as a [[Hindu]] place of worship, serves as a hub for the spiritual, cultural, and humanitarian activities of BAPS. The organization has about 1,300 mandirs and a total of 3,300 volunteer-run centers spanning five continents.&lt;ref name="BAPS Global Network Site"&gt;{{cite web|title=BAPS Center Locator|url=http://www.baps.org/Global-Network.aspx|publisher=BAPS Swaminarayan Sanstha|accessdate=12 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BAPS Swaminarayan Sanstha"&gt;{{cite web|title=92nd Birthday Celebrations of Pramukh Swami Maharaj, Ahmedabad, India|url=http://www.baps.org/News/2012/92nd-Birthday-Celebrations-of-Pramukh-Swami-Maharaj-4404.aspx|publisher=BAPS Swaminarayan Sanstha|accessdate=17 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the tradition of the [[Bhakti Movement]], [[Swaminarayan]] and his spiritual successors began erecting mandirs to provide a means to uphold proper devotion to God on the path towards [[moksha]], or ultimate liberation.&lt;ref name="Gadhada II-27"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gadhada II-27|title=The Vachanamrut: Spiritual Discourses of Bhagwan Swaminarayan|year=2001|publisher=Swaminarayan Aksharpith|location=Amdavad|isbn=81-7526-190-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|440}} BAPS mandirs thus facilitate devotional commitment to the [[Akshar Purushottam Upasana]], in which followers strive to reach the spiritually perfect state of Aksharbrahman, or the ideal devotee, thereby gaining the ability to properly worship Purushottam, the Supreme Godhead.&lt;ref name="Kim PT"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kim |first=Hanna |title=Public engagement and personal desires: BAPS Swaminarayan temples and their contribution to the discourses on religion |journal=International Journal of Hindu Studies |date=December 2009 |volume=13 |issue=3 |doi=10.1007/s11407-010-9081-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|7–13}}

===Mandir Rituals===
The offering of [[bhakti]], or devotion to God, remains at the center of mandir activities. In all BAPS Swaminarayan mandirs, [[murtis]], or sacred images of [[Swaminarayan]], [[Gunatitanand Swami]], BAPS guru's and other deities, are enshrined in the [[Garbhagriha|inner sanctum]]. After completion of [[prana pratishta]] or life-force installation ceremonies, the deities are believed to reside in the murtis, and are thus subjects of direct worship through sacred daily rituals.&lt;ref name="Williams2001"/&gt;{{rp|240}} In many mandirs, murtis are adorned with clothes and ornaments and devotees come to perform [[Darśana|darshan]], the act of worshiping the deity by viewing the sacred image.&lt;ref name="Williams2001"/&gt;{{rp|131, 140}}&lt;ref name="EoH 119"&gt;{{cite book|last=Jones|first=Constance|title=Encyclopedia of Hinduism|year=2007|publisher=Infobase Publishing|location=New York|isbn=0-8160-7336-8|pages=119}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aarti]], which is a ritual of waving lit lamps in circular motions to illuminate the different parts of the murti while singing a song of praise, is performed five times daily in [[Shikharband Mandir|shikharbaddha mandirs]] and twice daily in smaller [[Dev Mandir|mandirs]]. Additionally, food is offered to the murtis amidst the singing of devotional songs three times a day as part of the ritual of [[Prasad|thaal]], and the sanctified food is then distributed to devotees.&lt;ref name="Williams2001"/&gt;{{rp|140}}  Daily readings of and discourses on various Hindu scriptures also take place in the mandir.&lt;ref name="Williams2001"/&gt;{{rp|132}}  Many mandirs are also home to BAPS sadhus, or  monks.&lt;ref name="Williams2001"/&gt;{{rp|50}}  On weekends, assemblies are held in which sadhus and devotees deliver discourses on a variety of spiritual topics. During these assemblies, bhakti is offered in the form of call-and-response hymns (''[[kirtans]]'') with traditional musical accompaniment. Religious assemblies also take place for children and teenagers of various age ranges.&lt;ref name="Williams2001"/&gt;{{rp|62}}  Throughout the year, mandirs celebrate traditional Hindu festivals. Assemblies with special discourses, kirtans, and other performances are arranged to commemorate [[Swaminarayan Jayanti|Rama Navami]], [[Janmashtami]], [[Diwali]], and other major Hindu holidays.&lt;ref name="Williams2001"/&gt;{{rp|138–147}} Members of the sect are known as [[Satsangi]]es.  Male Satsangies are generally initiated by obtaining a [[Kanthi Mala|kanthi]] at the hands of a sadhu or senior male devotee while females receive the [[vartman]] from the senior women followers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.swaminarayan.org/faq/bapsgeneral.htm#4 |title=Q#4 How does a person join the Swaminarayan Sampraday? |work=FAQ|publisher=swaminarayan.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mandir Activities===
In addition to being focal points of religious activity, BAPS mandirs are also centers of culture.&lt;ref name="Kim PT"/&gt;{{rp|21}}  Many forms of traditional Indian art have their roots in Hindu scriptures and have been preserved and flourished in the setting of mandirs.&lt;ref name="Williams2001"/&gt;{{rp|220}}  Many BAPS mandirs outside of India hold [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]] classes to facilitate scriptural study, instruction in traditional dance forms in preparation for performances in festival assemblies, and music classes where students are taught how to play traditional instruments such as [[tabla]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Shri Swaminarayan Mandir|url=http://pluralism.org/profiles/view/71207|work=Pluralism Project|publisher=Harvard University|accessdate=11 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Indiapost Harijayanti"&gt;{{cite news|title=BAPS celebrates Swaminarayan Jayanti &amp; Ram Navmi|url=http://www.indiapost.com/baps-celebrates-swaminarayan-jayanti-ram-navmi/|accessdate=11 January 2013|newspaper=India Post|date=22 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many devotees view the mandir as a place for transmission of knowledge of Hindu values and their incorporation into daily routines, family life, and careers.&lt;ref name="BS"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kim|first=Hanna|title=Being Swarninarayan: the ontology and significance of belief in the construction of a Gujarati diaspora|year=2001|publisher=Bell &amp; Howell Information and Learning Company |location=Ann Arbor}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|418–422}}&lt;ref name="India Herald Spiritual Quotient"&gt;{{cite news|title=1,200 young adults from North America attend Spiritual Quotient Seminar|url=http://india-herald.com/young-adults-from-north-america-attend-spiritual-quotient-seminar-p2299-1.htm|accessdate=11 January 2013|newspaper=India Herald|date=30 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from classes teaching about religion and culture, mandirs are also the site of activities focused on youth development. Many centers organize college preparatory classes, leadership training seminars and workplace skills development workshops.&lt;ref name="Atlanta Conf"&gt;{{cite news|last=Dave|first=Hiral|title=Baps tells Youth to uphold values|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/world/report_baps-tells-youth-to-uphold-values_1232640|accessdate=11 January 2013|newspaper=Daily News &amp; Analysis|date=20 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kalam Youth"&gt;{{cite news|title=Strive to be unique, Kalam tells youth|url=http://www.indiapost.com/strive-to-be-unique-kalam-tells-youth/|accessdate=11 January 2013|newspaper=India Post|date=29 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Chino Hills Youth"&gt;{{cite web|last=Patel|first=Divyesh|title=BAPS Commemorates Education with Educational Development Day|url=http://www.chinohills.com/news-articles-details/BAPS_Commemorates_Education_with_Educational_Development_Day-1542|work=ChinoHills.com|accessdate=11 January 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130222020011/http://www.chinohills.com/news-articles-details/BAPS_Commemorates_Education_with_Educational_Development_Day-1542|archivedate=22 February 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many centers host women's conferences aimed at empowering young women.&lt;ref name="Chicago Women's"&gt;{{cite news|last=Padmanabhan|first=R|title=BAPS Swaminarayan Sanstha Hosts Women's Conference in Chicago|url=http://www.nritoday.net/women/287-aug-08-baps-swaminarayan-sanstha-hosts-womens-conference-in-chicago|accessdate=11 January 2013|newspaper=NRI Today|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130916133018/http://www.nritoday.net/women/287-aug-08-baps-swaminarayan-sanstha-hosts-womens-conference-in-chicago|archivedate=16 September 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They also host sports tournaments and initiatives to promote healthy lifestyles among children and youth.&lt;ref name="Childrens Health"&gt;{{cite news|last=Piccirilli|first=Amanda|title=BAPS Charities stresses importance of children's health|url=http://www.timesherald.com/article/20120813/NEWS03/120819840/baps-charities-stresses-importance-of-children-146-s-health|accessdate=11 January 2013|newspaper=The Times Herald|date=13 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many centers also host parenting seminars, marriage counseling, and events for family bonding.&lt;ref name="Hinduism Today Parenting"&gt;{{cite web|title=Parents Are the Key|url=http://www.hinduismtoday.com/modules/smartsection/print.php?itemid=1432|publisher=Hinduism Today|accessdate=11 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BAPS Charities|url=http://berkleycenter.georgetown.edu/resources/organizations/baps-charities|publisher=Georgetown University|accessdate=11 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The founder of BAPS, [[Shastriji Maharaj]], built its first and "namesake" mandir in [[Bochasan]], [[Gujarat]].&lt;ref name="Kim PT"/&gt;{{rp|8–9}}

The organization's second mandir was built in [[Salangpur|Sarangpur]], which also hosts a seminary for BAPS sadhus.&lt;ref name="Williams2001"/&gt;{{rp|112}}

The mandir in [[Gondal, India|Gondal]] was constructed around the [[Akshar Deri]], the cremation memorial of [[Gunatitanand Swami]], who is revered as a manifestation of Aksharbrahman.&lt;ref name="Williams2001"/&gt;{{rp|132}}

Shastriji Maharaj constructed his last mandir on the banks of the [[River Ghela]] in [[Gadhada]], where [[Swaminarayan]] resided for the majority of his adult life.&lt;ref name="Williams2001"/&gt;{{rp|19}}&lt;ref name="Kim PT"/&gt;{{rp|9}}

[[Yogiji Maharaj]] constructed the mandir in the Shahibaug section of [[Ahmedabad]], which remains the site of the international headquarters of the organization.&lt;ref name="BS"/&gt;{{rp|86}}

Under the leadership of [[Pramukh Swami Maharaj]], over 25 additional shikharbaddha mandirs have been erected across [[Gujarat]] and other regions of India and abroad.

As a consequence of the Indian emigration patterns, mandirs have been erected in Africa, Europe, North America, and the Asia-Pacific region.&lt;ref name="Kim PT"/&gt;{{rp|13–14}}  The [[BAPS Shri Swaminarayan Mandir London|BAPS mandir in Neasden]], London was the first traditional Hindu mandir built in Europe.&lt;ref name="Kim PT"/&gt;{{rp|11–12}}  The organization's sixth and largest  North American shikharbaddha mandir was inaugurated in 2014 in the [[New Jersey]] suburb of [[Robbinsville Township, New Jersey|Robbinsville Township]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nj.com/mercer/index.ssf/2014/07/traditional_hindu_temple_finds_home_in_robbinsville_just_off_route_130.html&lt;/ref&gt; and is the world's largest Hindu temple.&lt;ref name="NJLargestBAPS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/worlds-largest-hindu-temple-being-built-new-jersey-n166616|title=World's Largest Hindu Temple Being Built in New Jersey|date=July 28, 2014|publisher=NBC News|author=Frances Kai-Hwa Wang|accessdate=December 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

BAPS will construct the first Hindu stone temple in the Middle East, in Abu Dhabi, the Capital city of United Arab Emirates. The temple will be constructed on 55,000 square metres of land. The temple will be hand-carved by Indian temple artisans and assembled in the UAE. It is projected to completed by 2020, and open to people of all religious backgrounds. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi officially launched the foundation stone-laying ceremony.

==History==

===Doctrinal origins (1799–1905)===

====Formation====
The History of BAPS as an organization begins with Shastriji Maharaj's desire to propagate the mode of worship&lt;ref name="Dave 1974"/&gt;{{rp|186}} as interpreted from [[Swaminarayan]]'s teachings.&lt;ref name="Raghuvirji Maharaj 1966"&gt;{{cite book|last=Raghuvirji Maharaj|first=Acharya|title=Shri Harililakalpataru (1st ed.)|year=1966|publisher=Sheth Maneklal Chunilal Nanavati Publishers|location=Mumbai|editor=Sadhu Shwetvaikunthdas (Translator)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Acharya 1911 13"&gt;{{cite book|last=Acharya|first=Viharilalji Maharaj|title=Shri Kirtan Kaustubhmala (1st ed.)|year=1911|publisher=Published by Kothari Hathibhai Nanjibhai by the order of Acharya Shripatiprasadji Maharaj and Kothari Gordhanbhai|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="100y"/&gt;{{rp|7}} During Swaminarayan's own time, his group's spread had been curbed by opposition from Vaishnava sampradayas and others hostile to Swaminarayan's bhakti teachings.&lt;ref name="Kim PT"/&gt;{{rp|363}} Due to the hostility of those who found Swaminarayan's growing popularity and teachings unacceptable, sadhus and devotees during Swaminarayan's time tempered some of the public presentation of his doctrine, despite their own convictions, to mitigate violence towards their newly formed devotional community.&lt;ref name="Kim PT"/&gt;{{rp|364}} The original doctrine taught by Swaminarayan continued to be conveyed in less public fora, but with the passage of time, Shastriji Maharaj sought to publicly reveal this doctrine, which asserted that Swaminarayan and his choicest devotee, [[Gunatitanand Swami]], were ontologically, Purushottam and Akshar, respectively.&lt;ref name="Dave 1974"/&gt;{{rp|186}} However, when Shastriji Maharaj began openly discoursing about this doctrine, hereafter the [[Akshar Purushottam Upasana|Akshar-Purushottam]] doctrine, he was met with opposition from some quarters within the Vartal diocese.&lt;ref name="Williams2001"/&gt;{{rp|55}}&lt;ref name="Kim PT"/&gt;{{rp|365}} As the opposition against him grew violent,&lt;ref name="Kim PT"/&gt;{{rp|365}} Shastriji Maharaj was left with no choice but to leave&lt;ref name="Williams2001"/&gt;{{rp|54–56}} Vartal to escape violent physical assaults.&lt;ref name="Kim PT"/&gt;{{rp|363–365}} Thus, Williams notes, the very basis for separation from the Vartal diocese and raison d’être for the formation of BAPS was this doctrinal issue.&lt;ref name="Williams2001"/&gt;{{rp|55}}&lt;ref name="Paranjape 2005 117"&gt;{{cite book|last=Paranjape|first=edited by Makarand|title=Dharma and development : the future of survival|year=2005|publisher=Samvad India Foundation|location=New Delhi|isbn=81-901318-3-4|page=117}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Paranjape|first=edited by Makarand|title=Dharma and development : the future of survival|year=2005|publisher=Samvad India Foundation|location=New Delhi|isbn=81-901318-3-4|page=129}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Revelation of Doctrine====

Swaminarayan is viewed as God (Purushottama) by BAPS followers.&lt;ref name="Kim PT"/&gt;{{rp|362}} Thus, his writings and discourses form the foundation for BAPS’ theological tenets.&lt;ref name="BS"/&gt;{{RP|342}} Regarding Swaminarayan's philosophy, Akshar plays a fundamental role in the overall scheme of ultimate liberation.&lt;ref name="Dave 1974"/&gt;{{rp|33}} To that end, Swaminarayan indicated that those who wish to offer pure devotion to God (Purushottama)&lt;ref name="Kim PT"/&gt;{{rp|364}} and are desirous of Moksha should imbibe the qualities of the Gunatit Guru&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Vachanamrut - Spiritual Discourses of Bhagwan Swaminarayan (An English Translation)|year=2006|publisher=Aksharpith|location=Amdavad|isbn=81-7526-320-2|pages=303}}&lt;/ref&gt; [Satsangijivanam Volume IV/72:1,2]. As Akshar, embodied as the Gunatit Guru,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Paranjape|first=edited by Makarand|title=Dharma and development : the future of survival|year=2005|publisher=Samvad India Foundation|location=New Delhi|isbn=81-901318-3-4|page=112}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pocock,|first=David Francis|title=Mind, body, and wealth; a story of belief and practice in an Indian village|year=1973|publisher=Blackwell|location=Oxford|isbn=0-631-15000-5|page=161|ol=17060237W}}&lt;/ref&gt; epitomizes  ideal devotion&lt;ref name="Williams2001"/&gt;{{rp|87}} transcending Maya. Swaminarayan's philosophical stand that liberation is unattainable unless one "identifies oneself with Akshar (a synonym of Brahman) and offers the highest devotion to Purushottam"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Digital Shikshapatri|url=http://www.shikshapatri.org.uk/~imagedb/view/viewalbumslide.php?idx=256|publisher=Oxford's Bodleian Library|accessdate=3 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; is also found in various Hindu scriptures [Mundaka Upanishad 3/2:9, Shrimad Bhagavatam I/1:1, Bhagvad Gita XVIII/54]. It follows that the doctrine that Shastriji Maharaj propagated, as Kim observes, "did not result in the rejection of any scriptures; instead, it was the beginning of a distinctive theology which added a single but powerful qualification, [that Akshar plays] in the form of the living guru".&lt;ref name="BS"/&gt;{{rp|318}}

BAPS devotees also believe that Swaminarayan propagated the same doctrine through the mandirs he built.&lt;ref name="Kim PT"/&gt;{{rp|364}} From 1822 to 1828, Swaminarayan constructed a total of six shikharbaddha mandirs in Gujarat; in each he installed the murtis of a principal deity coupled with their ideal devotee in the central shrine: [[Nar Narayan Dev|Nar-Narayan-Dev]] in [[Kalupur Swaminarayan Mandir|Ahmedabad]] (1822) and [[Shri Swaminarayan Mandir, Bhuj|Bhuj]] (1823), [[Lakshmi Narayan Dev|Lakshmi-Narayan-Dev]] in [[Shri Swaminarayan Mandir, Vadtal|Vartal]] (1824), [[Madan Mohan Dev|Madan-Mohan-Dev]] in [[Shri Swaminarayan Mandir, Dholera|Dholera]] (1826), [[Radha Raman Dev|Radha-Raman-Dev]] in [[Shri Swaminarayan Mandir, Junagadh|Junagadh]] (1828), and [[Gopinathji (god)|Gopi-Nathji]] in [[Shri Swaminarayan Mandir, Gadhada|Gadhada]] (1828).&lt;ref name="Kim PT"/&gt;{{rp|364–365}}

As Kim notes, "For BAPS devotees, the dual murtis in the original Swaminarayan temples imply that Swaminarayan did install a murti of himself alongside the murti of his ideal bhakta or Guru".&lt;ref name="Kim PT"/&gt;{{rp|364}} Thus, Shastriji Maharaj, was simply extending that idea by enshrining the murti of Swaminarayan along with Gunatitanand Swami, his ideal devotee, in the central sanctum.&lt;ref name="Kim PT"/&gt;{{rp|364}} However, many within the Vartal and Ahmedabad dioceses did not subscribe to this view, and this became one of the main points of disagreement that led to the schism.&lt;ref name="Williams1984"&gt;{{cite book|last=Williams|first=Raymond Brady|title=A New Face of Hinduism|year=1984|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge [Cambridgeshire]|isbn=0-521-27473-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|55}}

Shastriji Maharaj explained that as per Swaminarayan's teachings, God desired to remain on earth through a succession of enlightened gurus.&lt;ref name="Kim BS"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kim|first=Hanna|title=Being Swaminarayan: The Ontology and Significance of Belief in the Construction of a Gujarati Diaspora|year=2001|publisher=Bell &amp; Howell Information and Learning Company|location=Ann Arbor}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|317}} In many of his discourses in the Vachanamrut (Gadhada I-71,&lt;ref name="Aksharpith"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Vachanamrut - Spiritual Discourses of Bhagwan Swaminarayan (An English Translation)|year=2006|publisher=Aksharpith|location=Amdavad|isbn=81-7526-320-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|147–148}} Gadhada III-26&lt;ref name="Aksharpith"/&gt;{{rp|630–631}} and Vadtal 5&lt;ref name="Aksharpith"/&gt;{{rp|534}}) [[Swaminarayan]] explains that there forever exists a Gunatit Guru&lt;ref name="Kim PT"/&gt;{{rp|363}} (perfect devotee) through whom Swaminarayan manifests on earth&lt;ref name="Williams1984"/&gt;{{rp|92}} for the ultimate redemption of jivas.&lt;ref name="Dave 1974"&gt;{{cite book |last=Dave |first=H.T |title=Life and Philosophy of Shree Swaminarayan 1781-1830 |year=1974 |publisher=George Allen &amp; Unwin |location=London |isbn=0-04-294082-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|178}}

Shastriji Maharaj noted that Swaminarayan had "expressly designated" the Gunatit Guru to spiritually guide the satsang (spiritual fellowship) while instructing his nephews to help manage the administration of the fellowship within their respective dioceses.&lt;ref name="Kim BS"/&gt;{{rp|317}}&lt;ref name="Williams2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=Williams|first=Raymond Brady|title=Encyclopedia of new religious movements Swaminarayan Hinduism Founder: Sahajanand Swami Country of origin: India|year=2008|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=978-0-415-45383-7|edition=1. publ.}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|610}}

Numerous historical accounts&lt;ref name="Dave 1974"/&gt;{{rp|89}}&lt;ref name="Acharya 1911 13"/&gt; and texts&lt;ref name="Raghuvirji Maharaj 1966"/&gt; written during  Swaminarayan and Gunatitanand Swami's time period identify [[Gunatitanand Swami#Gunatitanand Swami as Akshar|Gunatitanand Swami as the embodiment of Akshar]]. Followers of BAPS believe that the Ekantik dharma that Swaminarayan desired to establish is embodied and propagated by the Ekantik Satpurush – the Gunatit Guru.&lt;ref name="Kim BS" /&gt;{{rp|327, 358}} The first such guru in the lineage was Gunatitanand Swami.&lt;ref name="Williams2001" /&gt;{{rp|90}} Shastriji Maharaj had understood from his own guru, Bhagatji Maharaj, that Gunatitanand Swami was the first Gunatit Guru in the lineage.&lt;ref name="Paranjape 2005 117" /&gt;

Historically, each Gunatit Guru in the lineage has continued to reveal his successor; Gunatitanand Swami revealed Pragji Bhakta ([[Bhagatji Maharaj]]), who in turn revealed [[Shastriji Maharaj]], who pointed to [[Yogiji Maharaj]], who revealed [[Pramukh Swami Maharaj]], the Guru, thus continuing the lineage of Akshar.&lt;ref name="Williams2001" /&gt;{{rp|89–90}}&lt;ref name="Paranjape 2005 117" /&gt; Most recently, Pramukh Swami Maharaj revealed [[Mahant Swami Maharaj]] as the next and current Guru in the lineage.

====Propagation of Doctrine by Bhagatji Maharaj====

[[Bhagatji Maharaj]], born Pragji Bhakta, was originally a householder disciple of [[Gopalanand Swami]]. He was instructed to seek the company of Gunatitanand Swami if he desired to attain the Gunatit state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Parekh (Translator)|first=Gujarati text, Harshadrai Tribhuvandas Dave ; English translation, Amar|title=Brahmaswarup Shri Pragji Bhakta : life and work|year=2011|publisher=Swaminarayan Aksharpith|location=Ahmedabad|isbn=978-81-7526-425-0|pages=24|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ishwarcharandas|first=Sadhu|title=Pragji Bhakta (Bhagatji Maharaj) - A short biography of Brahmaswarup Bhagatji Maharaj|year=2009|publisher=Swaminarayan Aksharpith|location=Ahmedabad|isbn=81-7526-260-5|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; As he associated with Gunatitanand Swami, he began spending more time in Junagadh and obeyed every command from his new guru. He wanted to renounce the world and become an ascetic but he was told not to.&lt;ref name="Williams2001"/&gt;{{rp|56}}  Bhagatji Maharaj over time came to believe that the doctrine of Akshar-Purushottam was the true doctrine propagated by Swaminarayan.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.swaminarayan.org/bhagatjimaharaj/life/10.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

He was excommunicated from the [[Swaminarayan Sampraday]] for preaching about Akshar Purushottam Upsana.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.swaminarayan.org/bhagatjimaharaj/life/15.htm&lt;/ref&gt; After Gunatitanand Swami’s passing in 1867, Bhagatji Maharaj continue to spread the knowledge of his guru’s identity as Akshar and Swaminarayan's identity as Purushottam. He was later reinstated &lt;ref&gt;http://www.swaminarayan.org/bhagatjimaharaj/life/17.htm&lt;/ref&gt; and continued to teach as a householder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ishwarcharandas|first=Sadhu|title=Pragji Bhakta - A short biography of Brahmaswarup Bhagatji Maharaj|year=1978|publisher=Swaminarayan Aksharpith|location=Ahmedabad|pages=134}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though he had a checkered history with the saints&lt;ref&gt;http://argumentwp.vipserv.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/pdfv6n1/13_argument_v6_n1_Alles.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and authorities at Vadtal, the task to organize a separate religious community was left to his successor.&lt;ref name="Williams2001"/&gt;{{rp|56}} He himself was not recognized as Akshar by the masses during his lifetime but his inclusion is significant in the [[BAPS]] lineage because he was a Sat-Shudra (lower caste) from a family of a tailor caste and was not a sadhu.&lt;ref name="Williams2001"/&gt;{{rp|54}}

In 1883,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ishwarcharandas|first=Sadhu|title=Pragji Bhakta - A short biography of Brahmaswarup Bhagatji Maharaj|year=1978|publisher=Swaminarayan Aksharpith|location=Ahmedabad|pages=191–192}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ishwarcharandas|first=Sadhu|title=Pragji Bhakta (Bhagatji Maharaj) - A short biography of Brahmaswarup Bhagatji Maharaj|year=2009|publisher=Swaminarayan Aksharpith|location=Ahmedabad|isbn=81-7526-260-5|page=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shastriji Maharaj met Bhagatji Maharaj in Surat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|year=2008|title=Swaminarayan Bliss|publisher=Swaminarayan Aksharpith|location=Ahmedabad|page=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recognizing Bhagatji Maharaj's spiritual caliber, Shastriji Maharaj began spending increasing amounts of time listening to Bhagatji Maharaj's discourses, and soon, he accepted Bhagatji Maharaj as his guru.&lt;ref name="Amrutvijaydas 2006"&gt;{{cite book|last=Amrutvijaydas|first=Sadhu|title=Shastriji Maharaj Life and Work|year=2006|publisher=Swaminarayan Aksharpith|location=Ahmedabad|isbn=81-7526-305-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|21}} Over time, Shastriji Maharaj also became a strong proponent of the Akshar-Purushottam Upasana.&lt;ref name="Williams2001"/&gt;{{rp|55}} After Bhagatji Maharaj died on 7 November 1897,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ishwarcharandas|first=Sadhu|title=Pragji Bhakta - A short biography of Brahmaswarup Bhagatji Maharaj|year=1978|publisher=Swaminarayan Aksharpith|location=Ahmedabad|page=65}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shastriji Maharaj became the primary proponent of the doctrine of Akshar-Purushottam.&lt;ref name="Williams2001"/&gt;{{rp|55}} He believed that the construction of mandirs guided by this doctrine was urgently needed to facilitate followers’ practice of this understanding of Swaminarayan devotion and identified Gunatitanand Swami and Bhagatji Maharaj as the first and second embodiments of Akshar.&lt;ref name="Kim PT"/&gt;{{rp|363}}

===Schism, split and early foundational years (1905–1950)===

In this regard, Shastriji Maharaj persuaded Acharya Kunjvihariprasadji to consecrate the murtis of Akshar (Gunatitanand Swami) and Purushottam (Swaminarayan) in the Vadhwan mandir.&lt;ref name="Amrutvijaydas 2006"/&gt;{{rp|21}} Shastriji Maharaj's identification of Gunatitanand Swami as the personal form of Akshar was already a paradigm shift for some that led to "opposition and hostility"&lt;ref name="Kim PT"/&gt;{{rp|363}} from many within the Vadtal diocese.&lt;ref name="Kim PT"/&gt;{{rp|357–390}} Moreover, the installation of Gunatitanand Swami's murti next to Swaminarayan in the Vadhwan Mandir, led to further hostility and opposition from many sadhus of the Vadtal temple who were determined to prevent the murti of Gunatitanand Swami from being placed [along with Swaminarayan in the central shrine].&lt;ref name="Williams2001"/&gt;{{rp|55}} Jaga Bhakta, a respected devotee of Gunatitanand Swami said: "It is the wish of Maharaj that the upasana (worship) of Akshar Purushottam should be established. Therefore, you must take up this work. It shall be your shortcoming if you don't take a pledge to accomplish this task, and it shall be my shortcoming if I default in fulfilling it."

Following this, several attempts to murder him were made,&lt;ref name="Kim PT"/&gt;{{rp|365}} but Shastriji Maharaj maintained his reluctance to leave Vadtal.&lt;ref name="Amrutvijaydas 2006"/&gt;{{rp|21}} Since Bhagatji Maharaj promised him, "Even if they cut you into pieces, I will stitch you together, but you must never leave the doors of Vartal,” Shastriji Maharaj refused to leave.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.swaminarayan.org/shastrijimaharaj/life/29.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Seeing the unrelenting threat to Shastriji Maharaj's life, Krishnaji Ada, a respected devotee of the Swaminarayan Sampraday, advised him to leave for his own safety, as per the teachings of Swaminarayan in the Shikshapatri Verse 153–154.&lt;ref name="Amrutvijaydas 2006"/&gt;{{rp|21}}  Acknowledging the commands of Swaminarayan in the Shikshapatri, and interpreting Krishnaji Ada's words to be of Bhagatji Maharaj,&lt;ref name="Amrutvijaydas 2006"/&gt;{{rp|21}} Shastriji Maharaj decided to leave&lt;ref name="Williams1984"/&gt;{{rp|54–56}} the Vadtal temple to preach in the surrounding regions until the temple became safe again.&lt;ref name="Amrutvijaydas 2006"/&gt;{{rp|21}}

On 12 November 1905, Shastriji Maharaj left the Vadtal temple with five sadhus and the support of about 150 devotees.&lt;ref name="100y"&gt;{{cite book |first=Sadhu |last=Amrutvijaydas |title=100 Years of BAPS |year=2007 |publisher=Aksharpith|location=Amdavad|isbn=81-7526-377-6 |url=http://www.swaminarayan.org/publications/books/100yearsofbaps.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|13}} However, he did not want to believe that he was separating from Vadtal&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dave|first=Kishore M.|title=Shastriji Maharaj - A brief biography of Brahmaswarup Shastriji Maharaj|year=2009|publisher=Swaminarayan Aksharpith|location=Ahmedabad|isbn=81-7526-129-3|pages=64–65}}&lt;/ref&gt; as he initially instructed his followers to continue their financial contributions to and participation in the temples of the Vartal diocese.&lt;ref name="Kim PT"/&gt;{{rp|365}} After several court proceedings, lawsuits and hearings, a legal conclusion was reached. A district judge citing an affidavit from Shastriji Maharaj which stated that he succeeded from the [[Swaminarayan Sampraday]] ruled that BAPS sadhus did not have the right to stay or preach in the Swaminarayan Sampraday and he ordered Shastriji to stop sending his sadhus to their temples.&lt;ref name="williams58"&gt;{{cite book|last=Williams|first=Raymond|title=An Introduction to Swaminarayan Hinduism|year=2001|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=United Kingdom|isbn=978-0-521-65422-7|pages=58}}&lt;/ref&gt; See [[Shastriji Maharaj#Formation of BAPS|Shastriji Maharaj: Formation of BAPS]]

;Mandirs to facilitate doctrinal practice
On 5 June 1907 he consecrated the murtis of [[Swaminarayan]] and [[Gunatitanand Swami]] in the central shrine of a shikharbaddha mandir he was constructing in the village of Bochasan in the Kheda District of Gujarat.&lt;ref name="Kim BS"/&gt;{{rp|91}} This event was later seen to mark the formal establishment of the Bochasanwasi Akshar-Purushottam Swaminarayan Sanstha,&lt;ref name="Kim PT"/&gt;{{rp|364}} which was later abbreviated as BAPS. The Gujarati word Bochasanwasi implies hailing from Bochasan, since the organization's first Mandir was in this village.

Shastriji Maharaj continued to consolidate and spread the Akshar-Purushottam teachings of the nascent BAPS and spent the majority of 1908–15 discoursing throughout Gujarat, while continuing construction work of mandirs in Bochasan and Sarangpur. As recognition of Shastriji Maharaj's teachings continued to spread throughout Gujarat, he acquired a loyal and growing group of devotees, admirers, and supporters, many of whom were formerly associated with the Vartal or Ahmedabad diocese of the Swaminarayan Sampradaya.&lt;ref name="Kim PT"/&gt;{{rp|365}} Over the next four decades, Shastriji Maharaj completed four more shikharabaddha mandirs in Gujarat (Sarangpur - 1916, Gondal - 1934, Atladra - 1945, and Gadadha - 1951).&lt;ref name="Kim PT"/&gt;{{rp|365}}

Kim notes that these temples, in essence, represented the fundamental doctrine that Shastriji Maharaj wished to propagate based on Swaminarayan's teachings: "the ultimate reality [Purushottam] and the means, in the form of the Guru, which [enables a] devotee to offer eternal devotion to the ultimate reality".&lt;ref name="Kim PT"/&gt;{{rp|365}} Thus, this historical period marked a "focused emphasis" on building shikharabaddha mandirs as a means of conveying Swaminarayan doctrine. Shashtriji Maharaj was accepted as the third successor, or Akshar by BAPS devotees.&lt;ref name="Tripathy2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Dr. Preeti Tripathy|title=Indian religions: tradition, history and culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lixAAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=third+successor+shastriji&amp;dq=third+successor+shastriji&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjvlfXa1-LaAhUp5IMKHSc_D-0Q6AEILzAC|year=2010|publisher=Axis Publications|isbn=978-93-80376-17-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Successors
On 12 August 1910 Shastriji Maharaj met his eventual successor, [[Sadhu Gnãnjivandas|Yogiji Maharaj]], at the house of Jadavji in Bochasan.&lt;ref name="100y"/&gt;{{rp|16}} Yogiji Maharaj was a resident sadhu at Junagadh Mandir (Saurãshtra),&lt;ref name="Dave 1974"/&gt;{{rp|183}} where Gunatitanand Swami had served as mahant.&lt;ref name="100y"/&gt;{{rp|17}} Yogiji Maharaj regarded Gunatitanand Swami as Akshar and also served the murti of Shri Harikrishna Maharaj which had previously been worshipped by Gunatitanand Swami.&lt;ref name="100y"/&gt;{{rp|17}} As he already believed in the doctrine being preached by Shastriji Maharaj, Yogiji Maharaj left Junagadh on 9 July 1911 with six sadhus to join Shastriji Maharaj's mission.&lt;ref name="Dave 1974"/&gt;{{rp|186}}

On 7 November 1939, 17-year-old Shantilal Patel(who would become [[Pramukh Swami Maharaj]]) left his home&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Shelat|first=Kirit|title=Yug Purush Pujya Pramukh Swami Maharaj - a life dedicated to others|year=2005|publisher=Shri Bhagwati Trust|location=Ahmedabad|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was initiated by Shastriji Maharaj into the parshad order, as Shanti Bhagat, on 22 November 1939,&lt;ref name="Shelat 2005 8"&gt;{{cite book|last=Shelat|first=Kirit|title=Yug Purush Pujya Pramukh Swami Maharaj - a life dedicated to others|year=2005|publisher=Shri Bhagwati Trust|location=Ahmedabad|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and into the sadhu order, as Sadhu Narayanswarupdas, on 10 January 1940.&lt;ref name="Shelat 2005 8"/&gt; Initially, he studied Sanskrit and Hindu scriptures&lt;ref name="Shelat 2005 8"/&gt; and served as Shastriji Maharaj's personal secretary. In 1946, he was appointed administrative head (''Kothari'') of the Sarangpur mandir.&lt;ref name="Shelat 2005 8"/&gt;

In the early part of 1950, Shastriji Maharaj wrote several letters to 28-year-old Shastri Narayanswarupdas expressing a wish to appoint him as the administrative president of the organization. Initially, Shastri Narayanswarupdas was reluctant to accept the position, citing his young age and lack of experience and suggesting that an elderly, experienced sadhu should take the responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vivekjivandas|first=Sadhu|title=Pramukh Varni Din|journal=Swaminarayan Bliss|date=June 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Shastriji Maharaj insisted over several months, until, seeing the wish and insistence of his guru, Shastri Narayanswarupdas accepted the responsibility.&lt;ref name="Shelat 2005 8"/&gt; On 21 May 1950 at Ambli-Vali Pol in Amdavad, Shastriji Maharaj appointed Shastri Narayanswarupdas as the administrative president (''Pramukh'') of BAPS.&lt;ref name="100y"/&gt;{{rp|11}} He instructed Shastri Narayanswarupdas, who now began to be referred to as Pramukh Swami, to ennoble Satsang under the guidance of Yogiji Maharaj.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Pramukh Varni Din |url=http://www.swaminarayan.org/festivals/pramukhvarni/ |work=Swaminarayan|publisher=Swaminarayan Aksharpith |accessdate=4 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the last few years of his life, Shastriji Maharaj took steps to preserve the growth and future of BAPS by registering BAPS as a charitable trust in 1947 under India's new legal code.&lt;ref name="100y"/&gt;{{rp|33}}

===Development and Organizational Formation (1950–1971)===
After the death of [[Shastriji Maharaj]] on 10 May 1951,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dave|first=Kishore M.|title=Shastriji Maharaj - A brief biography of Brahmaswarup Shastriji Maharaj|year=2009|publisher=Swaminarayan Aksharpith|location=Ahmedabad|isbn=81-7526-129-3|page=111}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Yogiji Maharaj]] became the spiritual leader, or Guru, of the organization while [[Pramukh Swami Maharaj|Pramukh Swami]] continued to oversee administrative matters as president of the organization.&lt;ref name="Williams2001"/&gt;{{rp|60}} Yogiji Maharaj carried Shastriji Maharaj's mission of fostering the Akshar-Purushottam doctrine by building temples, touring villages, preaching overseas and initiating weekly local religious assemblies for children, youths and elders. In his 20 years as guru, from 1951 to 1971, he visited over 4,000 cities, towns and villages, consecrated over 60 mandirs and wrote over 545,000 letters to devotees.&lt;ref name="100y"/&gt;{{rp|9}}

;Youth Movement
This period of BAPS history saw an important expansion in youth activities. [[Yogiji Maharaj]] believed that in a time of profound and rapid social ferment, there was an imminent need to save the young from ‘degeneration of moral, cultural and religious values’.&lt;ref name="Brear 1996"&gt;{{cite book|title=A sacred thread : modern transmission of Hindu traditions in India and abroad|year=1996|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York|isbn=0-231-10779-X|first=Douglas|last=Brear|edition=Columbia University Press|contribution=Transmission of sacred scripture in the British East Midlands: the Vachanamritam |editor=Raymond Brady Williams}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|219}} To fill a void in spiritual activities for youths, Yogiji Maharaj started a regular Sunday gathering (Yuvak Mandal) of young men in Bombay&lt;ref name="Brear 1996"/&gt;{{rp|217}} in 1952.&lt;ref name="100y"/&gt;{{rp|167}} Brear notes, "His flair, dynamism and concern led within ten years to the establishment of many yuvak mandals of dedicated young men in Gujarat and East Africa".&lt;ref name="Brear 1996"/&gt;{{rp|217}}
In addition to providing religious and spiritual guidance, Yogiji Maharaj encouraged youths to work hard and excel in their studies. Towards realizing such ideals, he would often remind them to stay away from worldly temptations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Yogiji Maharaj - Sermons of Yogiji Maharaj |url=http://www.swaminarayan.org/yogijimaharaj/life/32.htm |work=Swaminarayan|publisher=Swaminarayan Aksharpith|accessdate=4 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of youths decided to take monastic vows.&lt;ref name="Dave 1974"/&gt;{{rp|187}} On 11 May 1961 during the Gadhada Kalash Mahotsav, he initiated 51 college-educated youths into the monastic order as sadhus.&lt;ref name="100y"/&gt;{{rp|168}} [[Mahant Swami Maharaj|Mahant Swami]] initiated as Sadhu Keshavjivandas was one of the initiates.

;East Africa
Satsang in Africa had started during Shastriji Maharaj's lifetime, as many devotees had migrated to Africa for economic reasons. One of Shastriji Maharaj's senior sadhus, Nirgundas Swami, engaged in lengthy correspondence with these devotees, answering their questions and inspiring them to start satsang assemblies in Africa. Eventually, in 1928, Harman Patel took the murtis of Akshar-Purushottam Maharaj to East Africa and started a small center.&lt;ref  name="100y"/&gt;{{rp|20}} Soon, the East Africa Satsang Mandal was established under the leadership of Harman Patel and Magan Patel.&lt;ref name="100y"/&gt;{{rp|20}}

In 1955, Yogiji Maharaj embarked on his first foreign tour to East Africa.&lt;ref name="Brear 1996"/&gt;{{rp|217}} The prime reason for the visit was to consecrate Africa's first Akshar-Purushottam temple in Mombasa. The temple was inaugurated on 25 April 1955.&lt;ref name="100y"/&gt;{{rp|168}}&lt;ref name="Younger 2010 266"&gt;{{cite book|last=Younger|first=Paul|title=New homelands : Hindu communities in Mauritius, Guyana, Trinidad, South Africa, Fiji, and East Africa|year=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=0-19-539164-0|page=266|edition=[Online-Ausg.]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also travelled to [[Nairobi]], [[Nakuru]], [[Kisumu]], [[Tororo]], [[Jinja, Uganda|Jinja]], [[Kampala]], [[Mwanza]] and [[Dar es salaam]].&lt;ref name="100y"/&gt;{{rp|168}} His travels inspired the local devotees to begin temple construction projects. 
Due to the visit, in a span of five years, the devotees in Uganda completed the construction of temples in Tororo, Jinja and Kampala and asked Yogiji Maharaj to revisit Uganda to install the murtis of Akshar-Purushottam Maharaj. The rapid temple constructions in Africa were helped by the presence of early immigrants, mainly Leva Patels, who came to work as masons, and were particularly skilled in temple building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Salvadori|first=Cynthia|title=Revivals, reformations &amp; revisions of Hinduism; the Swaminarayan religion|journal=Through open doors : a view of Asian cultures in Kenya|year=1989|page=127}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result, Yogiji Maharaj made a second visit to East Africa in 1960 and consecrated [[Dev Mandir|hari mandirs]] in Kampala, Jinja and Tororo in Uganda.&lt;ref name="100y"/&gt;{{rp|50}} 
Despite his failing health, Yogiji Maharaj at the age of 78 undertook a third overseas tour of London and East Africa in 1970.&lt;ref name="100y"/&gt;{{rp|169}} Prior to his visit, the devotees had purchased the premises of the Indian Christian Union at [[Ngara, Kenya]] in 1966 and remodeled it to resemble a three-spired temple.&lt;ref name="Salvadori 1989 128"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Salvadori|first=Cynthia|title=Revivals, reformations &amp; revisions of Hinduism; the Swaminarayan religion|journal=Through open doors : a view of Asian cultures in Kenya|year=1989|page=128}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yogiji Maharaj inaugurated the temple in Ngara, a suburb of Nairobi in 1970.&lt;ref name="Younger 2010 266"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Salvadori 1989 128"/&gt;

;England
In 1950, disciples Mahendra Patel and Purushottam Patel held small personal services at their homes in England. Mahendra Patel, a barrister by vocation, writes, "I landed in London in 1950 for further studies. Purushottambhai Patel...was residing in the county of Kent. His address was given to me by Yogiji Maharaj".&lt;ref name="Shelat 2005 17"&gt;{{cite book|last=Shelat|first=Kirit|title=Yug Purush Pujya Pramukh Swami Maharaj - a life dedicated to others|year=2005|publisher=Shri Bhagwati Trust|location=Ahmedabad|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning 1953, D. D. Meghani held assemblies in his office that brought together several followers in an organized setting. 
In 1958, leading devotees including Navin Swaminarayan, Praful Patel and Chatranjan Patel from India and East Africa began arriving to the UK.&lt;ref name="Shelat 2005 17"/&gt; They started weekly assemblies at Seymour Place every Saturday evening at a devotee's house.&lt;ref name="Shelat 2005 17"/&gt; 
In 1959, a formal constitution was drafted and the group registered as the "Swaminarayan Hindu Mission, London Fellowship Centre".&lt;ref name="Shelat 2005 17"/&gt; D.D. Megani served as Chairman, Mahendra Patel as Vice-Chairman and Praful Patel the secretary.&lt;ref name="Shelat 2005 17"/&gt;
On Sunday, 14 June 1970, the first BAPS temple in England was opened at Islington by Yogiji Maharaj.&lt;ref name="Shelat 2005 17"/&gt; In this same year he established the Shree Swaminarayan Mission&lt;ref name="Dave 1974"/&gt;{{rp|189}} as a formal organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Heath|first=edited by Deana|title=Communalism and globalization in South Asia and its diaspora|year=2010|publisher=Routledge|location=Abingdon, Oxon|isbn=0-203-83705-3|page=52|author2=Mathur, Chandana}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;United States
Yogiji Maharaj was unable to travel to the United States during his consecutive foreign tours. Nonetheless, he asked Dr. K.C. Patel, a chemistry instructor at Brooklyn College, to begin satsang assemblies in the United States.&lt;ref name="Kurien 2007 105"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kurien|first=Prema A.|title=A place at the multicultural table : the development of an American Hinduism|year=2007|publisher=Rutgers Univ.

In 1970, Yogiji Maharaj accepted the request of these students and sent four sadhus to visit the U.S.&lt;ref name="Kurien 2007 105"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jones|first=Constance A.|title=Encyclopedia of Hinduism|year=2008|publisher=Checkmark Books|location=New York|isbn=0-8160-7336-8|page=431|author2=Ryan, James D.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tour motivated followers to start satsang sabhas in their own homes every Sunday around the country.&lt;ref name="Kurien 2007 105"/&gt; Soon, K.C. Patel established a non-profit organization known as BSS under US law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kurien|first=Prema A.|title=A place at the multicultural table : the development of an American Hinduism|year=2007|publisher=Rutgers University Press|location=New Brunswick, New Jersey|isbn=0-8135-4056-9|page=106|edition=online}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, a fledgling Satsang Mandal formed in the United States before the death of Yogiji Maharaj in 1971.

===Growth and Further Global Expansion (1971–2016)===
After [[Yogiji Maharaj|Yogiji Maharaj’s]] death, [[Pramukh Swami Maharaj]] became both the spiritual and administrative head of BAPS&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kim|first=Hanna Hea-Sun|date=2001|title=Being Swaminarayan – The Ontology and Significance of Belief in the Construction of a Gujarati Diaspora|url=|journal=Dissertation Abstracts International, Section A: The Humanities and Social Sciences|volume=62|issue=2|page=77|doi=|issn=0419-4209|pmid=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1971.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of religion|last=Jones|first=Lindsay|publisher=Detroit : Macmillan Reference USA/Thomson Gale, c2005.|year=2005|isbn=978-0028659824|location=|pages=8891|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was the fifth spiritual Guru of the BAPS organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.baps.org/About-BAPS/TheCurrentSpiritualGuru-PramukhSwamiMaharaj/Spiritual-Lineage.aspx|title=Bhagwan Swaminarayan's Spiritual Lineage|website=BAPS Swaminarayan Sanstha|access-date=2016-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under his leadership, BAPS has grown into a global Hindu organization and has witnessed expansion in several areas. His work has been built on the foundations laid by his gurus – Shastriji Maharaj and Yogiji Maharaj.

;Personal Outreach (1971–1981)
Immediately upon taking helm, Pramukh Swami Maharaj ventured on a hectic spiritual tour in the first decade of his role as the new Spiritual Guru. Despite health conditions—[[cataract]] operation in 1980—he continued to make extensive tours to more than 4000 villages and towns, visiting over 67,000 homes and performing image installation ceremonies in 77 temples in this first decade.&lt;ref name="Williams2001" /&gt; He also embarked on a series of overseas tours beginning in 1974 as the Guru. Subsequent tours were made in 1977, 1979, and 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=100 Years of BAPS|last=Sadhu|first=Amrutvijaydas|publisher=Swaminarayan Aksharpith|year=December 2007|isbn=978-8175263772|location=Amdavad|pages=169|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Overall, he embarked on a total of 27 international spiritual tours between 1974 and 2007.&lt;ref name="Kurien 2007 105" /&gt; His travels were motivated by his desire to reach out to devotees for their spiritual uplift and to spread the teachings of [[Swaminarayan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.baps.org/About-BAPS/TheCurrentSpiritualGuru-PramukhSwamiMaharaj/Vicharan.aspx|title=Pramukh Swami's Vicharan|website=BAPS Swaminarayan Sanstha|access-date=2016-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Festivals and Organization     (1981–1992)
The personal outreach (vicharan) of the earlier era (1971–81) by Pramukh Swami Maharaj through traveling to villages and towns, writing letters to devotees, and giving discourses contributed to sustaining a global BAPS community.

The Gujarati migration patterns in the early 1970s, globalization factors and economic dynamics between India and the West saw the organization transform into a transnational devotional movement.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kim|first=Hanna Hea-Sun|date=2012|title=A Fine Balance: Adaptation and Accommodation in the Swaminarayan Sanstha|url=|journal=Gujarati Communities Across the Globe: Memory, Identity and Continuity. Edited by Sharmina Mawani and Anjoom Mukadam|publisher=Stoke-on-Trent, United Kingdom: Trentham Books|volume=|issue=|pages=141–156|doi=10.1111/rsr.12043_9|pmid=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Organizational needs spanned from transmitting cultural identity through spiritual discourses to the newer much alienated generation in the new lands, temple upkeep and traveling to regional and local centers to disseminate spiritual knowledge. As a result, this era saw a significant rise in the number of sadhus initiated to maintain the organizational needs of the community – both in India and abroad. Furthermore, having access to a greater volunteer force and community enabled the organization to celebrate festivals on a massive scale which marked the arrival of a number of milestone anniversaries in the history of the organization, including the bicentenary of [[Swaminarayan]], bicentenary of [[Gunatitanand Swami]], and the centenary of [[Yogiji Maharaj]]. Some effects of the celebration included a maturation of organizational capacity, increased commitment and skill of volunteers,  and tangentially, an increased interest in the monastic path.

The Swaminarayan bicentenary celebration, a once in a life-time event for Swaminarayan followers, was held in [[Ahmedabad|Amdavad]] in April 1981.&lt;ref name="Williams2001" /&gt; On 7th March 1981, 207 youths were initiated into the monastic order.&lt;ref name="Williams2001" /&gt; In 1985 the bicentenary birth of [[Gunatitanand Swami]] was celebrated.&lt;ref name="Williams2001" /&gt; During this festival, 200 youths were initiated into the monastic order.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.baps.org/About-BAPS/TheCurrentSpiritualGuru-PramukhSwamiMaharaj/His-Work.aspx|title=Pramukh Swami's Work|website=BAPS Swaminarayan Sanstha|access-date=2016-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization held Cultural festivals of India in London in 1985 and New Jersey in 1991.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The month-long Cultural Festival of India was held at Alexandra Palace in London in 1985.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The same festival was shipped to US as a month-long Cultural Festival of India at Middlesex County College in [[Edison, New Jersey]].&lt;ref name="Brear 1996" /&gt;

Migrational patterns in the 70s led to a disproportionate number of Hindus in the diaspora.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Culturally, a need arose to celebrate special festivals (Cultural Festival of India) to reach out to youths in the diaspora to foster understanding and appreciation of their mother culture in a context accessible to them.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Angela|first=Rudert,|date=2004-05-11|title=Inherent Faith and Negotiated Power:  Swaminarayan Women in the United States|url=http://hdl.handle.net/1813/106|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; To engage the youths, festival grounds housed temporary exhibitions ranging from interactive media, dioramas, panoramic scenes and even 3D-exhibits.

By the end of the era, owing to the success of these festivals and the cultural impact it had on the youths, the organization saw a need to create a permanent exhibition in the [[Akshardham (Gandhinagar)|Gandhinagar Akshardham Temple complex]] in 1991.

In 1992, a month-long festival was held to both celebrate Yogiji Maharaj's centenary and to inaugurate a permanent exhibition and temple called [[Akshardham (Gandhinagar)|Swaminarayan Akshardham in Gandhinagar]]. The festival also saw 125 youths initiated into the monastic order bringing the total number of sadhus initiated to more than 700 in fulfillment to a prophecy made by [[Yogiji Maharaj]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.baps.org/News/2003/700-BAPS-Sadhus-1634.aspx|title=700 BAPS Sadhus|website=BAPS Swaminarayan Sanstha|access-date=2016-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Mandirs and Global Growth (1992–2016)

In the third leg of the era, the organization saw an unprecedented level of mandir construction activities taking place in order to accommodate the rapid rise of adherents across the global Indian diaspora. Initially, beginning with the inauguration of [[Akshardham (Gandhinagar)|Swaminarayan Akshardham in Gandhinagar]] in 1992. A number of [[Shikharbaddha mandir]]s (large traditional stone mandirs) were inaugurated in major cities; [[BAPS Shri Swaminarayan Mandir London|Neasden]] (1995), [[BAPS Shri Swaminarayan Mandir Nairobi|Nairobi]] (1999), New Delhi (2004), [[Akshardham (Delhi)|Swaminarayan Akshardham]] (2005), [[BAPS Shri Swaminarayan Mandir Houston|Houston]] (2004), [[BAPS Shri Swaminarayan Mandir Chicago|Chicago]] (2004), [[BAPS Shri Swaminarayan Mandir Toronto|Toronto]] (2007), [[BAPS Shri Swaminarayan Mandir Atlanta|Atlanta]] (2007) and [[BAPS Shri Swaminarayan Mandir Chino Hills, Los Angeles|Los Angeles]] (2012).

===Mahant Swami Maharaj as Guru (2016–Present)===

Today, BAPS continues to flourish further with the guidance and inspiration from [[Mahant Swami Maharaj]]. He takes forward the legacy of Gunatit Satpurush by continuous vicharan (Travelling across the World) and helping spiritual seekers (Devotees) to attain the higher state of spirituality. He further nurtures the work of Pramukh Swami Maharaj by creating wonderful Temples, initiate Sadhus (monk) by giving diksha to aspiring devotees and promote the creation &amp; sustenance of shastras - or spiritual scripts.

He continues to travel across the world by visiting BAPS temples in India, Africa, Europe, America and Asia-Pacific countries. During his vicharan, he guide the spiritual seekers by blessing them in the form of his Darshan (seeing him) and Katha (his discourse). During his morning discourse after his pooja and in the evening assemblies; he mainly speaks on how we can attain God and peace by being Egoless (Nirmani), seeing divinity in all (Divyabhav), not seeing, talking or adapting any negative nature or behaviour of people around us (No Abhav-Avgun) and keeping unity amongst us (Samp).

==Philosophy==
The philosophy of BAPS is centered on the doctrine of Akshar Purshottam Upasana, in which followers worship Swaminarayan as God, or Purshottam, and his choicest devotee Gunatitanand Swami, as Akshar.&lt;ref name="Williams1984"/&gt;{{rp|73}} The concept of Akshar has been interpreted differently by various Swaminarayan denominations, and one major reason for the separation of BAPS from the Vartal diocese has been attributed to doctrinal differences in the interpretation of the concept of Akshar. Both the Vadtal and Ahmedabad dioceses of the Swaminaryan sampradaya believe Akshar to be the divine abode of the supreme entity Purushottam.&lt;ref name="Williams1984"/&gt;{{rp|73}} The BAPS denomination concurs that Akshar is the divine abode of Purushottam, but they further understand Akshar as "an eternally existing spiritual reality having two forms, the impersonal and the personal"&lt;ref name="Williams1984"/&gt;{{rp|73}}&lt;ref&gt;Gadhada I-21 The Vachanamrut: Spiritual Discourses of Bhagwan Swaminarayan. Ahmedabad: Swaminarayan Aksharpith. 2003. 2nd edition. {{ISBN|81-7526-190-0}}, pg. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; Followers of BAPS identify various scriptures and documented statements of Swaminarayan as supporting this understanding of Akshar within the Akshar Purushottam Upasana.&lt;ref name="Williams2004"/&gt;{{rp|95–103}} BAPS teaches that the entity of Akshar remains on earth through a lineage of "perfect devotees", the gurus or spiritual teachers of the organization, who provide "authentication of office through Gunatitanand Swami and back to Swaminarayan himself."&lt;ref name="Williams2001"/&gt;{{rp|92}} Followers hold Mahant Swami Maharaj&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; as the personified form of Akshar and the spiritual leader of BAPS.

===Swaminarayan Ontology===
The Swaminarayan ontology comprises five eternal entities: Jiva, Ishwar, Maya, Brahman, and Parabrahman. The entities are separate and distinct from one another and structured within a hierarchy.&lt;ref&gt;Mukundcharandas, Sadhu (2004). Vachnamrut Handbook (Insights into Bhagwan Swaminarayan's Teachings). Amdavad: Swaminarayan Aksharpith. p. 154. {{ISBN|81-7526-263-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Encompassing the entities of both Swaminarayan and his ideal devotee, this hierarchy emphasizes the relationship between Akshar and Purshottam.&lt;ref name="Kim BS"/&gt;{{rp|65}}

''Parabrahma''- At the top is Parabrahman. Parabrahman is the highest reality, God. He is understood as Sarva karta (all-doer), Sarvopari (transcendent), Sakar (having a form), and Pragat (present on the earth).&lt;ref name="Kim BS"/&gt;{{rp|318}}   He is also one and unparalleled, the reservoir for all forms of bliss and eternally divine. Parabrahman is also referred to as Purshottam and Paramatma, both of which reflect his supreme existential state.&lt;ref name="Kim BS"/&gt;{{rp|319}} Furthermore, Parabrahman is the only unconditioned entity upon which the other four entities are contingent.&lt;ref name="Williams2001"/&gt;{{rp|78}}

''Brahma''- Subservient to Parabrahman is Brahman, also known as Akshar, which exists simultaneously in four states. The first state is in the form of the impersonal Chidakash, the divine, all-pervading substratum of the cosmos.&lt;ref&gt;Vachnamrut, Gadhada I-46, The Vachanamrut: Spiritual Discourses of Bhagwan Swaminarayan. Ahmedabad: Swaminarayan Aksharpith. 2003. 2nd edition. {{ISBN|81-7526-190-0}} p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt;  Another form of Akshar is the divine abode of Parabrahman, known as Akshardham.&lt;ref name="Kim BS"/&gt;{{rp|319}}  Muktas, or liberated jivas (souls), also dwell here in unfathomable bliss and luster which is beyond the scope of human imagination. The other two states of Akshar are personal, which manifest as the ideal servant of Purshottam, both within his divine abode of Akshardham and simultaneously on earth as the God-realized saint.&lt;ref name="Kim BS"/&gt;{{rp|320}}

''Maya''- Below Brahman is maya. Maya has three main qualities of sattva, rajas, and tamas (These influences encompass the spectrum of maya, ranging from goodness, passions, and darkness, respectively&lt;ref&gt;Vachnamrut, Gadhada I-12, The Vachanamrut: Spiritual Discourses of Bhagwan Swaminarayan. Ahmedabad: Swaminarayan Aksharpith. 2003. 2nd edition. {{ISBN|81-7526-190-0}}, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;) that it utilizes to create the physical world.&lt;ref&gt;Dr G. Sundaram.

===Akshar Purshottam Upasana===
;History
In 1907, Shastriji Maharaj consecrated the images of Akshar and Purshottam in a temple's central shrine in the village of [[Bochasan]] as sacred, marking the formation of the BAPS fellowship as a formally distinct organization. However, the fundamental beliefs of the sampraday date back to the time of Swaminarayan.&lt;ref&gt;Amrutvijaydas, Sadhu (2006). Shastriji Maharaj Life and Work. Amdavad: Swaminarayan Aksharpith.{{ISBN|81-7526-305-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; One revelation of Gunatitanand Swami as Akshar occurred in 1810 at the grand yagna of Dhaban, during which Swaminarayan initiated Gunatitanand Swami as a sadhu. On this occasion, Swaminarayan publicly confirmed that Gunatitanand Swami was the incarnation of Akshar, declaring, "Today, I am extremely happy to initiate Mulji Sharma. He is my divine abode – Akshardham, which is infinite and endless." The first Acharya of the Vartal diocese, Raghuvirji Maharaj, recorded this declaration in his composition, the Harililakalpataru (7.17.49-50).&lt;ref&gt;Acharya, Raghuvirji Maharaj; Sadhu Shwetvaikunthdas (Translator) (1966). Shri Harililakalpataru (1st ed.). Mumbai: Sheth Maneklal Chunilal Nanavati Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; Under Shastriji Maharaj, considered the manifest form of Akshar at the time, the fellowship continued the traditions of the Akshar Purshottam Upasana. He focused on the revelations of Gunatitanand Swami as Swaminaryan's divine abode and choicest devotee.&lt;ref&gt;Dave, Kishorebhai (2012). Akshar Purushottam Upasana As Revealed by Bhagwan Swaminarayan. Ahmedabad: Swaminarayan Aksharpith. p. 138. {{ISBN|978-81-7526-432-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

;Essence
The Akshar Purushottam Upasana refers to two separate entities within the Swaminarayan ontology.&lt;ref name="Kim BS"/&gt;{{rp|65}} These two entities are worshipped in conjunction by followers of BAPS in accordance with the instructions laid down in the Vachanamrut. According to BAPS, Swaminarayan refers to Akshar in the ''Vachanamrut'', with numerous appellations such as Sant, Satpurush, Bhakta and Sadhu, as having an august status that makes it an entity worth worshipping alongside God.&lt;ref name="Kim BS"/&gt;{{rp|453–455}} For example, in ''Vachanamrut Gadhada'' I-37, Swaminarayan states:
"In fact, the darshan of such a true Bhakta of God is equivalent to the darshan of God Himself"&lt;ref&gt;Vachanamrut, Gadhada I-37, The Vachanamrut: Spiritual Discourses of Bhagwan Swaminarayan. Ahmedabad: Swaminarayan Aksharpith. 2003. 2nd edition. {{ISBN|81-7526-190-0}}, p. 65&lt;/ref&gt; 
Moreover, in Vachanamrut Vartal 5, Swaminarayan states:
Just as one performs the [[mãnsi puja]] of God, if one also performs the mãnsi puja of the ideal Bhakta along with God, by offering him the prasãd of God; and just as one prepares a thãl for God, similarly, if one also prepares a thãl for God's ideal Bhakta and serves it to him; and just as one donates five rupees to God, similarly, if one also donates money to the great Sant – then by performing with extreme affection such similar service of God and the Sant who possesses the highest qualities…he will become a devotee of the highest calibre in this very life.&lt;ref&gt;Vartal 5. The Vachanamrut: Spiritual Discourses of Bhagwan Swaminarayan. Ahmedabad: Swaminarayan Aksharpith. 2003. 2nd edition. p. 536–537. {{ISBN|81-7526-190-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Thus, in all BAPS mandirs the image of Akshar is placed in the central shrine and worshipped alongside the image of Purushottam.&lt;ref name="Williams2001"/&gt;{{rp|86}}
Furthermore, BAPS believes that by understanding the greatness of God's choicest devotee, coupled with devotion and service to him and God, followers are able to grow spiritually. This practice is mentioned by Swaminarayan in Vachanamrut Vartal 5:
"by performing with extreme affection such similar service of God and the Sant who possesses the highest qualities, even if he is a devotee of the lowest type and was destined to become a devotee of the highest type after two lives, or after four lives, or after ten lives, or after 100 lives, he will become a devotee of the highest caliber in this very life. Such are the fruits of the similar service of God and God's Bhakta."&lt;ref&gt;Vachanamrut, Vartal 5, The Vachanamrut: Spiritual Discourses of Bhagwan Swaminarayan. Ahmedabad: Swaminarayan Aksharpith. 2003. 2nd edition, p.534&lt;/ref&gt;

;Metaphysical ends
As per the Akshar Purushottam Upasana, each jiva attains liberation and true realization through the manifest form of Akshar.&lt;ref&gt;G. Sundaram. The Concept of Social Service in the Philosophy of Sri Swaminarayan. p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;  Jivas who perform devotion to this personal form of Brahman can, despite remaining ontologically different, attain a similar spiritual standing as Brahman and then go to Akshardham.&lt;ref name="Kim BS"/&gt;{{rp|319–320}}&lt;ref&gt;Mukundcharandas, Sadhu (2004). Vachnamrut Handbook (Insights into Bhagwan Swaminarayan's Teachings). Amdavad: Swaminarayan Aksharpith. {{ISBN|81-7526-263-X}} p. 160&lt;/ref&gt;  It is only through the performance of devotion to Brahman that Parabrahman can be both realized and attained.&lt;ref&gt;G. Sundaram. The Concept of Social Service in the Philosophy of Sri Swaminarayan. p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;

;Akshar as a living entity
According to the Akshar Purushottam Upasana, the personal form of Akshar is forever present on the earth through a lineage of spiritual leaders, or gurus. It is through these gurus that Swaminarayan is also held to forever remain present on the earth.&lt;ref name="Williams2001"/&gt;{{rp|55}} These gurus are also essential in illuminating the path that needs to be taken by the jivas that earnestly desire to be liberated  from the cycle of rebirth.&lt;ref name="Kim BS"/&gt;{{rp|65}}  This lineage begins with Gunatitanand Swami (1785–1867), a sadhu who lived conterminously with Swaminarayan. Members of BAPS point to numerous historical anecdotes and scriptural references, particularly from the central Swaminarayan text known as the ''[[Vachanamrut]]'', as veritable evidence that Gunatitanand Swami was the manifest form of Akshar.&lt;ref name="Kim BS"/&gt;{{rp|76}}  Swaminarayan refers to this concept specifically in the Vachnamrut chapters of Gadhada I-21, Gadhada I-71, Gadhada III-26, Vadtal 5.&lt;ref name="Williams2001"/&gt;{{rp|92}} Following Gunatitanand Swami, the lineage continued on through Bhagatji Maharaj (1829–1897), Shastriji Maharaj (1865–1951), Yogiji Maharaj (1892–1971), and Pramukh Swami Maharaj (1921–2016). Today Mahant Swami Maharaj is said to be the manifest form of Akshar.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

===Swaminarayan Praxis===
According to BAPS doctrines, followers aim to attain a spiritual state similar to Brahman which is necessary for ultimate liberation.&lt;ref name="Kim BS"/&gt;{{rp|291}} The practices of BAPS Swaminarayans are an idealistic "portrait of Hinduism."&lt;ref name="Kim BS"/&gt;{{rp|6}} To become an ideal Hindu, followers must identify with Brahman, separate from the material body, and offer devotion to god&lt;ref&gt;Shikshapatri, shloka 116.&lt;/ref&gt; It is understood that through association with Akshar, in the form of the God-realized guru, one is able to achieve this spiritual state.&lt;ref name="Kim BS"/&gt;{{rp|325}} Followers live according to the spiritual guidance of the guru who is able to elevate the jiva to the state of Brahman.&lt;ref name="Kim BS"/&gt;{{rp|295}} Thus devotees aim to follow the spiritual guidance of the manifest form of Akshar embedding the principles of dharma (righteousness), gnana (knowledge), vairagya (detachment from material pleasures) and bhakti (devotion unto God) in to their lives.&lt;ref name="Kim BS"/&gt;{{rp|358}}
The basic practices of the Swaminarayan sect are based on these four principles. Followers receive jnana through regularly listening to spiritual discourses and reading scriptures in an effort to gain knowledge of God and one's true self.&lt;ref name="swaminarayan.org"&gt;http://www.swaminarayan.org/faq/bapsgeneral.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  Dharma encompasses righteous conduct as prescribed by the scriptures.&lt;ref name="swaminarayan.org"/&gt;  The ideals of dharma range from practicing non-violence to avoiding meat, onions, garlic, and other items in their diet. Lord Swaminarayan has outlined the dharma of his devotees in the scripture the Shikshapatri.&lt;ref name="Kim BS"/&gt;{{rp|456}} He has included practical aspects of living life such as not committing adultery to respecting elders, gurus, and those of authority.&lt;ref name="Kim BS"/&gt;{{rp|333}} Devotees develop vairagya in order to spiritually elevate their jivas to a Brahmic state. This entails practices such as fasting every eleventh day of each half of each lunar month and avoiding worldly pleasures by strongly attaching themselves to God.&lt;ref name="Kim BS"/&gt;{{rp|326}} The fourth pillar, bhakti, or devotion is at the heart of the BAPS faith community. Common practices of devotion include daily prayers, offering prepared dishes (thal) to the image of God, mental worship of God and his ideal devotee, and singing religious hymns.&lt;ref name="swaminarayan.org"/&gt;  Spiritual service, or seva, is a form of devotion where devotees serve selflessly "while keeping only the Lord in mind."&lt;ref name="Kim BS"/&gt;{{rp|343}}

Followers participate in various socio-spiritual activities with the objective to earn the grace of the guru and thus attain association with God through voluntary service.&lt;ref name="Williams2004"&gt;Williams, Raymond Brady (2004). "The Holy Man as the Abode of God in Swaminarayan Hinduism". Williams on South Asian Religions and Immigration; Collected Works (Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|97}} These numerous activities stem directly from the ideals taught by Swaminarayan, to find spiritual devotion in the service of others.&lt;ref name="Kim BS"/&gt;{{rp|319–320, 389}} By serving and volunteering in communities to please the guru, devotees  are considered to be serving the guru.&lt;ref name="Kim BS"/&gt;{{rp|389}}  This relationship is the driving force for the spiritual actions of devotees. The guru is [[Mahant Swami Maharaj]], who is seen as embodiment of selfless devotion. Under the guidance of [[Mahant Swami Maharaj]], followers observe the tenets of [[Swaminarayan]] through the above-mentioned practices, striving to please the guru and become close to God.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The organization operates 16 hospitals and clinics serving over 600,000 people annually, with its most recent hospitals opening in [[Ahmedabad]] in 2012 and in [[Vadodara]] in 2013.&lt;ref name="Clarke 2011 43"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Narendra Modi inaugurates BAPS Yogiji Maharaj Hospital in Ahmedabad|url=http://deshgujarat.com/2012/05/17/narendra-modi-inaugurates-baps-yogiji-maharaj-hospital-in-ahmedabad/|accessdate=6 March 2013|newspaper=DeshGujarat|date=17 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Inauguration of BAPS Shastriji Maharaj Hospital, Atladra (Vadodara), India|url=http://www.baps.org/News/2013/Inauguration-of-BAPS-Shastriji-Maharaj-Hospital-4664.aspx|publisher=Swaminarayan Aksharpith|accessdate=29 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, BAPS Charities organizes health fairs run by volunteer medical professionals where visitors can undergo screening tests, increase health awareness, participate in consultations, and receive treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=BAPS Annual Health Fair Promotes Wellness|url=http://www.indoamerican-news.com/archives/1901|accessdate=6 March 2013|newspaper=Indo American News|date=22 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Patel|first=Sandip|title=BAPS Health Fair in Bartlett a big success|url=http://www.indiapost.com/baps-health-fair-in-bartlett-a-big-success/|accessdate=6 March 2013|newspaper=India Post|date=16 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Supporting the goals of [[Michelle Obama]]'s "[[Let's Move]]" campaign which is working to end childhood obesity, BAPS Charities recently launched a health awareness initiative in the United States focused on educating parents and children on benefits of a vegetarian diet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=BAPS Charities support Michelle Obama's initiative|url=http://www.deccanherald.com/content/154507/baps-charities-support-michelle-obamas.html|accessdate=21 March 2013|newspaper=Deccan Herald|date=18 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  To support biomedical research, the Toronto chapter of BAPS Charities donated $100,000 raised from walk-a-thons for Toronto's [[Hospital for Sick Children]]'s Research and Learning Tower Campaign.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|title = Support SickKids with BAPS Charities annual walk|url = http://www.insidetoronto.com/news-story/67954-support-sickkids-with-baps-charities-annual-walk/|work = InsideToronto.com|accessdate = 21 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|title = Annual Report 2010-2011|url = http://www.sickkidsfoundation.com/togive/downloads/SKF_Annual_Report_1011.pdf|publisher = SickKids Foundation|accessdate = 21 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In India, the organization has carried out anti-addiction campaigns led by several thousand children who spent their summer vacations traveling through cities and villages persuading people to give up their addictions with personal appeals and presentations on the dangers of addictive behaviors.&lt;ref name="Clarke 2011 44"&gt;{{cite book|last=Clarke|first=Matthew|title=Development and Religion: Theology and Practice|year=2011|publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing|location=Northampton, MA|isbn=978-1-84844-584-0|page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education===
With a goal of improving educational opportunities and outcomes for younger generations, [[BAPS Charities]] funds scholarships, operates 10 schools and 8 colleges in addition to supporting other schools and running hostels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Clarke|first=Matthew|title=Development and Religion: Theology and Practice|year=2011|publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing|location=Northampton, MA|isbn=978-1-84844-584-0|pages=44–45}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Through volunteer-led classes, the organization is working towards achieving 100 percent literacy in villages in India.&lt;ref name="Clarke 2011 44"/&gt;  In Africa, BAPS Charities has been active in providing children in need with school uniforms, school supplies, and food and in addition to helping improve school facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BAPS Charities helps school children in Durban|url=http://www.bapscharities.org/mediacenter/announcements/2008/darbanschool.htm|publisher=BAPS Charities|accessdate=28 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BAPS Charities Food Drive, Dar-es-Salaam|url=http://www.bapscharities.org/mediacenter/announcements/2010/daressalaamfood.htm|publisher=BAPS Charities|accessdate=28 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BAPS Charities helps school students facing water-crisis|url=http://www.bapscharities.org/mediacenter/announcements/2009/watercrisis.htm|accessdate=28 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In North America, BAPS Charities also organizes annual seminars for professional development where workshops help youth develop interpersonal skills, public speaking, management skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=BAPS Swaminarayan Sanstha holds National Youth Leadership Seminar|url=http://www.atlantadunia.com/dunia/News09/N411.htm|accessdate=6 March 2013|newspaper=Atlanta Dunia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environment===
[[BAPS Charities]] manages several programs designed to protect and improve the environment. Volunteers across the world have raised ecological awareness and promoted conservation by employing energy-efficient technologies and organizing large-scale tree planting campaigns and recycling programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=BAPS Charities Goes Green for Earth Day|url=http://www.atlantadunia.com/dunia/News09/N2011/N628.htm|accessdate=6 March 2013|newspaper=Atlanta Dunia|date=23 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=BAPS Charities goes green for Earth Day|url=http://www.indiapost.com/baps-charities-goes-green-for-earth-day/|accessdate=6 March 2013|newspaper=India Post|date=5 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In India, the organization also leads campaigns to improve water supply and conservation and arranges camps to teach better animal husbandry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Clarke|first=Matthew|title=Development and Religion: Theology and Practice|year=2011|publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing|location=Northampton, MA|isbn=978-1-84844-584-0|page=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In Gujarat, BAPS along with other religious sects, professional associations, and civil rights groups expressed support for the Sardar Sarovar Dam project in the 1990s, citing its prospect of generating hydropower, irrigation, potable water, and flood management.&lt;ref name="Jones 2005 8890"&gt;{{cite book|last=Jones|first=Lindsay|title=Encyclopedia of Religion|year=2005|publisher=Thomson Gale|location=Farmington Hills|isbn=0-02-865984-8|page=8890}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Unprecedented Awakening to Counter the Challenge of the anti-Narmada Protestors [Narmada samena padkaro jheeli leva lokoman abhootpurva chetna]|newspaper=Gujarat Samachar|date=29 December 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Although some groups criticized the project for its effect of displacing area residents, BAPS sponsored initiatives to relocate and aid the affected communities.&lt;ref name="Jones 2005 8890"/&gt;

===Disaster relief===
Relieving human suffering in times of humanitarian emergencies remains an important component of [[BAPS Charities]]’ work. Within hours after the [[2001 Gujarat earthquake]], BAPS volunteers began providing victims with daily hot meals, clean water, and clothing and assisted with debris removal and search and rescue missions; the organization also adopted more than 10 villages in which they rebuilt the entire community, including all infrastructure and thousands of earthquake-resistant homes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Malik|first=Rajiv|title=To Rebuild Kutch|journal=Hinduism Today|date=July–August 2001|url=http://www.hinduismtoday.com/modules/smartsection/item.php?itemid=4063|accessdate=6 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Prince Charles comes to the aid of quake victims |url=http://expressindia.indianexpress.com/news/ie/daily/20010307/iin07011.html |accessdate=6 March 2013|newspaper=Indian Express|date=6 March 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;  With the help of donations from volunteers in India and abroad, the organization helped rebuild the area's communities by constructing schools, hospitals, and other buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Post-quake Kutch schools get facelift|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2002-06-22/ahmedabad/27318762_1_school-buildings-anjar-kutch|accessdate=6 March 2013|newspaper=The Times of India|date=22 June 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Harley|first=Gail|title=Hindu and Sikh Faiths in America|year=2003|publisher=Shoreline Publishing|location=New York|isbn=0-8160-4987-4|pages=82–83}}&lt;/ref&gt; After [[Hurricane Katrina]] struck the United States Gulf Coast region, BAPS Charities volunteer teams supplied hot food, water, emergency supplies, and relocation aid for victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=BAPS gives $10,000 to student victims of Katrina|url=http://india-herald.com/baps-gives-to-student-victims-of-katrina-p816-1.htm|accessdate=6 March 2013|newspaper=India Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The organization partnered with [[UNICEF]] to provide medicine, clean water, and temporary housing for children affected by the [[2010 Haiti earthquake]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=BAPS Charities’ donation totals $63,000 to UNICEF  for Haiti Earthquake Relief Fund|url=http://www.atlantadunia.com/dunia/News09/N561.htm|accessdate=6 March 2013|newspaper=Atlanta Dunia|date=6 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Community===
Along the continuum of humanitarian activities, [[BAPS Charities]] also organizes initiatives with the goal of effecting positive social change and promoting a stronger sense of community. The organization recently donated $250,000 to the [[National September 11 Memorial &amp; Museum]] in New York City to educate future generations about the importance of [[ahimsa]], or non-violence, and the consequences of hatred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BAPS Charities donates to the National September 11 Memorial &amp; Museum|url=http://www.bapscharities.org/services/supports-9-11-memorial.htm|publisher=BAPS Charities|accessdate=21 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Our Donors|url=https://www.911memorial.org/our-donors|publisher=National September 11 Memorial &amp; Museum|accessdate=21 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In India, BAPS Charities has organized numerous activities to help promote gender equality and improve the lives of women. Programs include campaigns against marriage dowries and domestic violence and seminars offering vocational guidance and self-employment training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Clarke|first=Matthew|title=Development and Religion: Theology and Practice|year=2011|publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing|location=Northampton, MA|isbn=978-1-84844-584-0|page=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Caring for the elderly and disabled is also a core value promoted by the organization. In the United Kingdom, BAPS Charities has an outreach program in place where children with chaperones regularly visit assisted living facilities and homes in their communities to spend time with the elderly residents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Clarke|first=Matthew|title=Development and Religion: Theology and Practice|year=2011|publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing|location=Northampton, MA|isbn=978-1-84844-584-0|page=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable projects and achievements==
BAPS Swaminarayan Sanstha is a charitable [[Non-governmental organization]]. The organization is recognized as a non-governmental organization, that holds general consultative status with the [[UNESCO|United Nations Economic and Social Council]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.swaminarayan.org/news/usa/2009/08/UN/index.htm |title=News of BAPS - BAPS participates in United Nations 6th annual International Youth Assembly |work=Swaminarayan.org |accessdate=2012-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UN"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.expressindia.com/news/ie/daily/20000911/iin11007.html |title=Pramukh Swami at the UN |accessdate=2008-01-15 |author= |last= |first= |date=2000-09-11 |publisher=[[The Indian Express|IndianExpress.com]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080115085308/http://www.expressindia.com/news/ie/daily/20000911/iin11007.html |archivedate=15 January 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*In November 2005, the President of BAPS, [[Pramukh Swami Maharaj]] – along with the [[President of India]], [[A.P.J. Abdul Kalam]], [[Prime Minister]], [[Dr. Manmohan Singh]], and the [[Leader of Opposition]], [[Lal Krishna Advani]]- inaugurated "[[Akshardham (Delhi)|Swaminarayan Akshardham]]", a {{convert|100|acre|km2|adj=on}} site in [[Delhi]]. [[Akshardham (Delhi)|Akshardham]] includes a {{convert|141|ft|m|abbr=on}} high monument constructed entirely of stone, two exhibition halls highlighting Indian culture and values, Delhi's first large format movie theater, gardens, and a temple ([[mandir]]). On December 17, 2007 in Ahmadabad, Gujarat, India's Delhi Akshardham was named the largest Hindu temple in the world by ''[[Guinness Book of World Records]]'' representative Mr. Michael Whitty. The Temple, built on banks of the [[Yamuna River]], was accused of lacking the environmental clearance and first culprit in Yamuna bed violation.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.indianexpress.com/news/akshardham-is-first-culprit-in-yamuna-bed-violation-ramesh/734643/&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Neasden Temple]] BAPS constructed what was at the time the world's largest traditional Hindu temple outside India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.swaminarayan.org/news/2000/07/guinnessbook/index.htm | title=Guinness World Record Certificate – London}}&lt;/ref&gt; BAPS Shri Swaminarayan Mandir, London &lt;https://web.archive.org/web/20130611161524/http://mandir.org/&gt;, also popularly known as the [[Neasden Temple]]) was opened in 1995. Constructed entirely from Marble and Limestone, the temple is popular amongst tourists seeking a unique place to visit in London. On 8 July 2000, the Managing Editor of [[Guinness Book of Records]], [[Tim Footman]] and Andrew W. Dowsey presented Pramukh Swami with certificates marking his entries into the world-famous record book. The first certificate presented to him was for building and inspiring the largest traditional Hindu [[mandir]] outside India. The second certificate marked a record 355 temple consecration ceremonies performed by Pramukh Swami between April 1971 and May 2000.
*In 1999 BAPS opened its first traditional temple in Africa at Nairobi, Kenya. The [[BAPS Shri Swaminarayan Mandir Nairobi|mandir in Nairobi]] is unique in that the interior is constructed entirely from intricately carved wood.
*In 2004 BAPS broke its own record when it opened the largest Hindu temple outside India near [[Chicago]], USA. Based upon the Neasden Temple, the [[BAPS Shri Swaminarayan Mandir Chicago|mandir in Chicago]] is the USA's second traditional Swaminarayan Temple. The [[BAPS Shri Swaminarayan Mandir Houston|mandir in Houston]] was the first. A similar, slightly smaller temple, it was opened in Texas, a month prior to the opening of the one in Chicago.
*July 2007 saw BAPS break its own record with the opening of the [[BAPS Shri Swaminarayan Mandir Toronto|mandir in Toronto]]. The first traditional stone temple in [[Canada]], and the largest such structure outside India. Just over a month later, in August 2007, the [[BAPS Shri Swaminarayan Mandir Atlanta|mandir in Atlanta]] was inaugurated, breaking the record broken the previous month in Toronto. The mandirs in Atlanta and Toronto are the two largest Hindu temples outside India.
*BAPS financed and [[producer (film)|produced]] the 2004 large format film, [[Mystic India]], which retraces the 12,000&amp;nbsp;km barefoot journey throughout 18th century [[India]] undertaken by  [[Neelkanth Varni]] at the age of 11.[http://www.mysticindia.com/]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5040">'''Christopher Neil-Smith''' (1920&amp;ndash;1995) was an [[Anglican]] minister who served as vicar of St Saviour's [[Hampstead]]&lt;ref&gt;Crockford's Clerical Directory, 1977-79, Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and is best known for his practice of [[exorcism]] and his [[parapsychological]] interests.&lt;ref name="Beeson"&gt;{{cite book|last=Beeson|first=Trevor |title=Priests And Prelates: The Daily Telegraph Clerical Obituaries  |publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|year=2006|chapter=The Reverend Christopher Neil-Smith|isbn=0-8264-8100-0|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=awPGiqoCrSgC&amp;pg=PA129&amp;dq=%22Christopher+Neil-Smith%22&amp;ei=nITPS6i6CKXkyQSO8-TMAg&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=%22The%20Reverend%20Christopher%20Neil-Smith%22&amp;f=false|accessdate=April 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neil-Smith is credited with performing more than three thousand exorcisms in Britain, starting in 1949. In 1972, the [[Bishop of London]] authorized him to exorcise [[Christian demonology|demons]] according to his own judgement.&lt;ref name="Kathleen R. Sands"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sands|first=Kathleen R|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=EENUIgdglNEC&amp;pg=PA206&amp;dq=Christopher+Neil-Smith&amp;cd=8#v=onepage&amp;q=Christopher%20Neil-Smith&amp;f=false|quote= At around the same time, Father Christopher Neil-Smith, an Anglican priest, received a standing license from the Bishop of London authorizing him to exorcise freely according to his own judgment.|title = Demon possession in Elizabethan England |publisher=[[Praeger Publishers]]|accessdate = 2010-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neil-Smith wrote ''Praying for Daylight: God Through Modern Eyes'',&lt;ref name="Christopher Neil-Smith"&gt;{{cite book|last=Neil-Smith|first=Christopher|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=sh3zGAAACAAJ&amp;dq=Christopher+Neil-Smith&amp;cd=2|title = Praying for daylight: God through modern eyes |publisher= P. Smith|accessdate = 2010-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as ''The Exorcist and the Possessed'', in which he detailed his experiences with and beliefs about exorcism.&lt;ref name="Marc Cramer"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cramer|first=Marc|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=fdB-AAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Christopher+Neil-Smith+exorcism&amp;dq=Christopher+Neil-Smith+exorcism&amp;lr=&amp;cd=10|title = The devil within|publisher= [[W. H. Allen Ltd|W.H. Allen]]|quote=with the noted exorcist, the Rev. Christopher Neil-Smith, author of an anecdotal book entitled ''The Exorcist and the Possessed''.|accessdate = 2010-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the latter, he claimed that evil should be treated as an actual force rather than an abstract idea.&lt;ref name="Lewis Spence"&gt;{{cite book|last=Spence|first=Lewis|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=U1qqguX24fAC&amp;pg=PA316&amp;lpg=PA316&amp;dq=Mike+Taylor+exorcism&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=v4LKpItSfc&amp;sig=CtWtopziI-IgLlIZi8_0QwBbkiI&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=u962S5LYNKLKMp2V5OEL&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false|title = Encyclopedia of Occultism and Parapsychology|publisher=[[Kessinger Publishing]] |accessdate = 2010-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Appearing on radio and television programs, he became notable as an authority on the subject of exorcism when Peter Blatty's ''[[The Exorcist (novel)|The Exorcist]]'' was released in 1970. According to biographer Trevor Beeson, the media coverage he gained "emphasized the more dramatic elements in his ministry, and encouraged him to extravagances which he later regretted." Neil-Smith died at the age of 75. He was married, and had two sons.&lt;ref name="Beeson" /&gt;

The impact of Christopher Neil-Smith's ministry at St Saviour's Church was to bring issues most closely related to [[deliverance ministry]] to the fore, although there is some suggestion that not all his parishioners were entirely enamoured of a priest whose interests, by his own admission, led him for a time into spiritual excesses. A colleague of Neil-Smith, [[Jack Dover Wellman]], vicar of [[Emmanuel Church, Hampstead]] was also an authority on the paranormal and upon exorcism, although with a greater emphasis upon Christian [[spiritual healing]]. Dover Wellman appears to have taken a gentler approach to his ministry than Neil-Smith sometimes managed, and maintained that to be psychic was a gift from God which needed to be developed in strict conformity with the teachings of Christ.&lt;ref&gt;Wellman, J.D, 1988, A Priest and the Paranormal, London, Churchman Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Neil-Smith's retirement, his former vicarage in Eton Road, Hampstead was purchased by the [[psychiatrist]] [[R.D. Laing]] , who used it as his home and base for his practice for a number of years. According to biographers, Laing believed the house to be haunted, and performed an exorcism of his own there before taking up residence.&lt;ref&gt;Laing, A, 1997, R.D.Laing - A Life, London, HarperCollins&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clay, J, 1997, R.D.

{{Christian Eschatology}}
'''Dispensationalism''' is a [[Hermeneutics|religious interpretive system]] for the [[Bible]]. It considers Biblical history as divided by God into [[Dispensation (period)|dispensations]], defined periods or ages to which God has allotted distinctive administrative principles. According to [[dispensationalist theology]], each age of [[God's plan (disambiguation)|God's plan]] is thus administered in a certain way, and humanity is held responsible as a [[Stewardship (theology) | steward]] during that time. Dispensationalists' presuppositions start with the harmony of history as focusing on the glory of God and put God at its center - as opposed to a central focus on humanity and their need for [[salvation]].&lt;ref&gt;Elements of Dispensational Truth Volume 1 by R. A. Huebner, page 3&lt;/ref&gt; A dispensational perspective can be seen in the writings of Jewish sects dating from around the time Christianity arose, for example in the Dead Sea Scrolls [[Community Rule]] (1QS).&lt;ref&gt;The Complete Dead Sea Scrolls in English (7th Edition) (Penguin Classics) by Geza Vermes, pages 98-116&lt;/ref&gt; Early [[Christian fundamentalism|Christian fundamentalists]] embraced the system as a defense of the Bible against [[religious liberalism]] and [[Liberal Christianity|modernism]], and dispensationalism became the majority position within Christian fundamentalism. 

Each divine [[dispensation (period)|dispensation]] features a cycle:{{cn|date=March 2018}}
* God reveals himself and his truth to humanity in a new way. 
* Humanity is held responsible to conform to that revelation. 
* Humanity rebels and fails the test.
* God judges humanity and introduces a new period of probation under a new administration.

Ultimately, dispensationalism demonstrates the progress of God's revelation to humanity and God's sovereignty through history&lt;ref&gt;Progressive Dispensationalism: An Analysis of the Movement and Defense of Traditional Dispensationalism, page xviii&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

== Dispensations ==
The number of dispensations discerned by theologians within Biblical history vary typically from three to eight (See History below). The three- and four-dispensation schemes are often referred to as minimalist, as they include the commonly recognized divisions{{explain|date=September 2018}} within Biblical history. The typical seven-dispensation scheme is as follows:{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

* [[Innocence]] &amp;ndash; [[Adam]] under probation prior to the Fall. Ends with expulsion from the [[Garden of Eden]]. Some refer to this period as the Adamic period or the dispensation of the Adamic covenant or Adamic law.
* [[Conscience]] &amp;ndash; From the Fall to the [[Genesis flood narrative|Great Flood]]. Ends with the worldwide deluge.
* Human [[Government]] &amp;ndash; After the Great Flood, humanity responsible to enact the [[death penalty]]. Ends with the dispersion at the [[Tower of Babel]]. Some use the term [[Noahide Law|Noahide law]] in reference to this period of dispensation.
* [[Promise]] &amp;ndash; From [[Abraham]] to [[Moses]]. Ends with the refusal to enter Canaan and the 40 years of unbelief in the wilderness. Some use the terms Abrahamic law or [[Abrahamic covenant]] in reference to this period of dispensation.
* [[Law]] &amp;ndash; From [[Moses]] to the [[crucifixion]] of [[Jesus Christ]]. Ends with the scattering of Israel in AD70. Some use the term [[Mosaic law]] in reference to this period of dispensation.
* [[Grace in Christianity|Grace]] &amp;ndash; From the cross to the [[rapture]] of the church. The rapture is followed by the [[Divine retribution|wrath of God]] comprising the [[Great Tribulation]]. Some use the term ''Age of Grace'' or ''the Church Age'' for this dispensation.
* [[Millennial Kingdom]] &amp;ndash; A [[Millennialism|1000 year]] reign of Christ on earth centered in [[Jerusalem in Christianity|Jerusalem]]. Ends with God's judgment on the final rebellion.

Numerous purposes for this cycle of administrations have been suggested. God is seen to be testing humanity under varying conditions, while vindicating his ways with humanity in originally granting them [[free will]]. The dispensations reveal God's truth in a progressive manner, and are designed to maximize the glory that will accrue to God as he brings history to a climax with a Kingdom administered by Christ, thus vindicating his original plan of administering rule on earth through "human" means. The goal of the dispensations is summarized by [[Paul the Apostle]] in {{bibleverse||Ephesians|1:9-10|NASB}}, "He made known to us the mystery of His will, according to His kind intention which He purposed in Him with a view to an administration suitable to the fullness of the times, that is, the summing up of all things in Christ, things in the heavens and things on the earth" ([[New American Standard Bible|NASB]]).

==Theology==
{{main|Dispensationalist theology}}

===Progressive revelation===
{{main|Progressive revelation (Christianity)}}
One important underlying theological concept for dispensationalism is progressive revelation. Some non-dispensationalists start with progressive revelation in the [[New Testament]] and refer this revelation back into the [[Old Testament]], whereas dispensationalists begin with progressive revelation in the Old Testament and read forward in a historical sense. Therefore, there is an emphasis on a gradually developed unity as seen in the entirety of Scripture. [[Covenant (biblical)|Biblical covenants]] are associated with the dispensations.
When these Biblical covenants are compared and contrasted, the result is a historical ordering of different dispensations. Dispensationalism emphasizes the original recipients to whom the different Biblical covenant promises were written. This has resulted in certain fundamental dispensational beliefs, such as a distinction between Israel and the Church.

===Historical-grammatical interpretation===
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2016}}
Another important theological concept is an emphasis on the [[historical-grammatical method|historical-grammatical]] (or literal) method of biblical interpretation.  For example, Israel is said to have literally experienced the curses mentioned by the Old Testament, and dispensationalists believe that the Jews will one day literally receive the blessings mentioned by the Old Testament. Neither the historical-grammatical method nor the concept of progressive revelation is exclusive to dispensationalists. However, a dispensational distinctive is created when the historical-grammatical method is coupled with an emphasis on progressive revelation, along with the historical development of the covenants in Scripture.

===Distinction between Israel and the Church===
The spectrum of teaching on Israel and the Church may be depicted as below:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |quote       = Ladd starts the eschatological kingdom in the Gospels. Progressives start the kingdom with the ascension of Christ. The most significant difference, however, is that Ladd treats the Church as a kind of "New Israel" in his commentary on Revelation. Progressive dispensationalism in no way advocates that the Church replaces Israel as in Ladd and in a more developed way in Covenant Theology (including brands of covenant premillennialism).

Dispensationalists profess a definite distinction between Israel and the Church. For dispensationalists, Israel is an ethnic nation&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title = Dispensationalism Today | last = Ryrie | first = Charles Caldwell | publisher = Moody Press | location = Chicago | year = 1965 | page = 137}}&lt;/ref&gt; consisting of Hebrews (Israelites), beginning with [[Abraham]] and continuing in existence to the present. The Church, on the other hand, consists of all saved individuals in this present dispensation—i.e., from the "birth of the Church" in Acts until the time of the [[Rapture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gotothebible.com/HTML/notwrath.html | title = Not Wrath, but Rapture | first = Harry A | last = Ironside | author-link = Harry A.

Dispensationalists believe that Israel as a nation will embrace Jesus as their [[messiah]] toward the end of the [[Great Tribulation]], right before the [[Second Coming]]. 
Classical dispensationalists refer to the present-day Church as a "parenthesis" or temporary interlude in the progress of Israel's prophesied history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|quote=It is the author's fervent conviction that the failure to understand what is revealed in Scripture concerning the Great Parenthesis between Messiah's rejection, with the consequent setting aside of Israel nationally, and the regathering of God's earthly people and recognition by the Lord in the last days, is the fundamental cause for many conflicting and unscriptural prophetic teachings. Once this parenthetical period is understood and the present work of God during this age is apprehended, the whole prophetic program unfolds with amazing clearness.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Progressive dispensationalism "softens" the Church/Israel distinction by seeing some Old Testament promises as expanded by the New Testament to include the Church. However, progressives never view this expansion as replacing promises to its original audience, Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |quote       = some OT promises can be expanded by the NT. However, this expansion is never viewed as replacing or undoing the implications of that OT promise to its original audience, Israel. For example, the Church's participation in the New Covenant taught in the NT can add the Church to the list of recipients of the New Covenant promises made in the OT. However, such participation does not rule out the future fulfillment of the OT New Covenant promises to Israel at the beginning of the Millennium. Thus, the promise can have a coinciding or overlapping fulfillment through NT expansions of the promise.

=== Premillenialist dispensationalism ===
[[Image:Millennial views.svg|thumb|380px|Comparison of Christian millennial interpretations]]
Dispensationalists are [[premillennialism|premillennialists]] who affirm a future, literal 1,000-year reign of Jesus Christ which merges with and continues on to the eternal state in the "new heavens and the new earth",&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Rev.|21}}&lt;/ref&gt; and they claim that the millennial kingdom will be [[theocratic]] in nature and not mainly [[soteriology|soteriological]], as it is considered by [[George Eldon Ladd]] and others with a non-dispensational form of premillennialism. Dispensationalism is known for its opinions respecting the nation of Israel during this millennial kingdom reign, in which Israel as a nation plays a major role and regains a king, a land, and an everlasting kingdom.

The vast majority of dispensationalists profess the pretribulation rapture, with small minorities professing to either a [[mid-tribulation rapture|mid-tribulation]] or [[post-tribulation rapture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | publisher = Contemporary Evangelical | isbn = 978-0-310-34041-6 | last = Walvoord | first = John F | title = Blessed hope and the tribulation | year = 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Refimprove|date=July 2009}}

[[File: History of Dispensationalism.png|thumb|Timeline of the history of Dispensationalism, showing the development of various streams of thought.]]

The concept of the arranging of divisions of Biblical history dates back to [[Irenaeus]] during the second century. Other Christian writers since then have offered their own arrangements of history, such as [[Augustine of Hippo]] and [[Joachim of Fiore]] (1135–1202).&lt;ref name='blaising'/&gt;{{rp|116}} Many Protestant and Calvinist writers also developed theological schemes and divisions of history,&lt;ref&gt;Including [[Herman Witsius]], [[Francis Turretin]],  John Bale, Thomas Brightman,  Henry Finch, John Archer, Thomas Manton, William Gouge, [[Thomas Goodwin]], John Birchensha, William Sherwin, Francis Hutchinson, Pierre Jurieu, Pierre Poiret, John Edwards, and [[Isaac Watts]]&lt;/ref&gt; in particular after the [[Westminster Confession of Faith]] noted "various dispensations".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Dispensationalism Before Darby: Seventeenth-Century and Eighteenth-Century English Apocalypticism.|last=Watson|first=William|publisher=Lampion Press|year=2015|isbn=978-1-942-61403-6|location=Silverton, OR|pages=}}, chapter 6&lt;/ref&gt; Other concepts also predated dispensationalism as a system, such as premillennialism and the rapture.&lt;ref&gt;Covenant Theology emerged from the Reformed tradition, which considers Biblical history through the "covenant of Grace" (not recorded in scripture) as administered variously through the actual recorded covenants in scripture. While many covenant theologians developed dispensational schemes, they were not theological dispensationalists even if Ryrie appeals to them for this one element of dispensationalism.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dispensationalism developed as a system from the teachings of [[John Nelson Darby]] (1800–82) who strongly influenced the [[Plymouth Brethren]] of the 1830s in Ireland and England. The original concept came when Darby considered the implications of Isaiah 32 for Israel. He saw that prophecy required a future fulfillment and realization of Israel's kingdom. The New Testament church was seen as a separate program not related to that kingdom. Thus arose a prophetic earthly kingdom program for Israel and a separate "Mystery" heavenly program for the church. In order to not conflate the two programs, the prophetic program had to be put on hold to allow for the church to come into existence. Then it is necessary for the church to be raptured away before prophecy can resume its earthly program for Israel.&lt;ref&gt;Update On Dispensationalism by Charles C. Ryrie in Issues In Dispensationalism edited by Wesley R. Willis and John R. Master, page 17&lt;/ref&gt; Some critics have claimed that there was no Christian teaching of a rapture before Darby began preaching about it in the 1830s, but recent research has discovered many sources in the preceding 250 years showing a development of the concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Dispensationalism Before Darby: Seventeenth-Century and Eighteenth-Century English Apocalypticism.|last=Watson|first=William|publisher=Lampion Press|year=2015|isbn=978-1-942-61403-6|location=Silverton, OR|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Darby's conception of dispensations, the Mosaic dispensation continues as a divine administration over earth up until the return of Christ. The church being a heavenly designated assembly does not have its own dispensation as per Scofield. Darby conceives of dispensations relating exclusively to the divine government of the earth and thus the church is not associated with any dispensations.

Darby traveled extensively to continental Europe, New Zealand, Canada, and the United States in an attempt to make converts to the Brethren philosophy. While his Brethren ecclesiology failed to catch on in America, his [[eschatology|eschatological]] doctrine became widely popular in the United States, especially among Baptists and Old School Presbyterians.&lt;ref name='Elwell'&gt;{{Cite book | last = Elwell | first = Walter A. | title = [[Evangelical Dictionary of Theology]] | location = Grand Rapids, MI | year = 1984 | publisher = Baker Book House | isbn = 0-8010-3413-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp |293}} American dispensationalism crossed over many denominational boundaries.

Regarding any supposed connection to [[Edward Irving]]:

{{quote|While Irving and the Albury group had a few eschatological ideas that were unique, a belief in the pre-tribulation rapture was not one of them. It is impossible for one to follow the historicist approach and also believe the rapture will occur before the tribulation, since historicists believe that the tribulation began hundreds of years ago and runs the course of most of the current church age. It is also true that Irvingites spoke of a soon coming of Christ to translate believers to heaven, but this view was part of their second coming belief that they could have derived from Manuel Lacunza’s writings, which were not the product of futurism at that point. [...]

On the other hand, Darby most likely thought of and then developed the idea of pre-tribulationism in the process of shifting to futurism. Paul Wilkinson notes that "Darby found an exegetical basis in Scripture for his doctrine of a pretribulation Rapture. As a careful student of the Bible, Darby had no need to appeal to an oracle for his doctrines. The unfounded and scurrilous accusations of MacPherson and his sympathizers contravene the whole ethos of John Nelson Darby, a man of integrity to whom the Word of God was paramount."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.tms.edu/m/TMS-Spring2016-Article-04.pdf Thomas Ice concludes in his article: EDWARD IRVING AND THE RAPTURE on pages 71-72&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===United States of America===
John Nelson Darby is considered by some to be the father of dispensationalism,&lt;ref name='blaising'/&gt;{{rp|10, 293}} which was adopted, modified, and made popular in the United States by the [[Scofield Reference Bible]]. [[Charles Henry Mackintosh]] (1820–96) popularized Darby more than any other Brethren author.{{cn|date=January 2017}}

Dispensationalism was introduced to North America by [[James Inglis (evangelist)|James Inglis]] (1813–72) through the monthly magazine ''Waymarks in the Wilderness'', published intermittently between 1854 and 1872.{{citation needed|date=March 2007}} During 1866, Inglis organized the Believers' Meeting for Bible Study, which introduced dispensationalist ideas to a small but influential circle of American [[Evangelicalism|evangelicals]]. They were disturbed by the inroads of [[religious liberalism]] and saw premillennialism as an answer. Dispensationalism was introduced as a premillennial position, and it largely took over the fundamentalist movement, over a period of several decades. The American church denominations rejected Darby's [[ecclesiology]] but accepted his [[eschatology]]. Many of these churches were Presbyterian and Baptist, and they retained Darby's Calvinistic [[soteriology]]. 

After Inglis' death, [[James H. Brookes]] (1830–98), the pastor of Walnut Street Presbyterian Church in St.&amp;nbsp;Louis, organized the [[Niagara Bible Conference]] (1876–97) to continue the dissemination of dispensationalist ideas. Dispensationalism was boosted after [[Dwight L. Moody]] (1837–1899) learned of dispensational theology from an unidentified member of the Brethren during 1872. Moody worked with Brookes and other dispensationalists and encouraged the spread of dispensationalism. The efforts of C.I. Scofield and his associates introduced dispensationalism to a wider audience in America by his Scofield Reference Bible. The publication of the Scofield Reference Bible during 1909 by the [[Oxford University Press]] for the first time displayed overtly dispensationalist notes on the pages of the Biblical text. The Scofield Bible became a popular Bible used by independent Evangelicals in the United States. Evangelist and Bible teacher [[Lewis Sperry Chafer]] (1871–1952) was influenced by Scofield; he founded the [[Dallas Theological Seminary]] during 1924, which has become the main institution of dispensationalism in America. The Baptist Bible Seminary in [[Clarks Summit, Pennsylvania]] became another dispensational school. Grace School of Theology opened in [[Houston, TX]] in 2003 as a dispensational school. Founded by graduates of [[Dallas Theological Seminary]], it holds "that the Bible must be interpreted as language is normally used, recognizing the importance of dispensational distinctions."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.gsot.edu/about-us/doctrinal-statement/|title=Doctrinal Statement - Grace School of Theology|work=Grace School of Theology|access-date=2018-10-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other prominent dispensationalists include [[Reuben Archer Torrey]] (1856–1928), [[James M. Gray]] (1851–1925), [[William J. Erdman]] (1833–1923), [[A. C. Dixon]] (1854–1925), [[A. J. Gordon]] (1836–95), and [[William Eugene Blackstone]], author of the book ''Jesus is Coming'' (endorsed by Torrey and Erdman). These men were active evangelists who promoted a host of Bible conferences and other missionary and evangelistic efforts. They also gave the dispensationalist philosophy institutional permanence by assuming leadership of new independent Bible institutes, such as the [[Moody Bible Institute]] during 1886, the Bible Institute of Los Angeles (now [[Biola University]]) during 1908, and Philadelphia College of Bible (now [[Cairn University]], formerly [[Philadelphia Biblical University]]) during 1913. The network of related institutes that soon developed became the nucleus for the spread of American dispensationalism.

Dispensationalism has become very popular with American evangelicalism{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}, especially among [[nondenominational]] Bible churches, [[Baptists]], [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostal]], and [[Charismatic movement|Charismatic]] groups. Conversely, Protestant denominations that embrace covenant theology as a whole tend to reject dispensationalism. For example, the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church (U.S.) (which subsequently merged with the United Presbyterian Church in the U.S.A. (PCUSA) in which Dispensationalism existed) termed it "evil and subversive" and regarded it as a heresy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bible.org/article/reflections-dispensationalism |publisher=Bible.org |title=Reflections: dispensationalism}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Churches of Christ]] underwent division during the 1930s as [[Robert Henry Boll]] (who taught a variant of the dispensational philosophy) and [[Foy E. Wallace]] (representing the amillennial opinion) disputed severely over eschatology.&lt;ref&gt;Prior to World War II, there had been no significant presence of amillennialism in Churches of Christ. See also [[Augustine of Hippo]], the theologian who established amillennialism as the eschatology of the [[Roman Catholic Church]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2018}}
Dispensationalism rejects the notion of [[supersessionism]], still considers the Jewish people as God's [[chosen people]], and some see the modern [[Israel|State of Israel]] as resulting in the Israel who will receive the fulfillment of all God's Old Testament promises.

John Nelson Darby taught, and most subsequent dispensationalists have maintained, that God considers the [[Jew]]s as his earthly chosen people, even as they remain in rejection of Jesus Christ, and God continues to maintain an earthly destiny in the future millennial Kingdom when the Lord Jesus Christ returns to earth and establishes it in fulfillment of prophecy in the prophetic scheme. Dispensationalists teach that a remnant within the nation of Israel will be born again, called of God, and by grace brought to realize that they crucified their Messiah. Dispensationalism is unique in teaching that the Church stands in a dispensation that occurs as a parenthesis in the prophetic Kingdom program, a dispensational "mystery" or "grace" period, meaning that it was not directly revealed in prophecy in the Old Testament, and that this "age of grace" will end with the rapture of the church allowing the prophetic clock for Israel to start up again. Then the Jewish remnant becomes manifest through the Great Tribulation as a result of recognizing Jesus as their promised Messiah during the trials that come upon them in this Tribulation which serves to purify the nation. Darby's teachings envision Judaism as continuing to enjoy God's protection literally to the end of time, and teach that God has a separate earthly and prophetic Kingdom "program," to use [[J. Dwight Pentecost]]'s term, for Israel and another heavenly (destined) Mystery program for the Church. Dispensationalists teach that God has eternal covenants with Israel which cannot be violated and must be honored and fulfilled.

Dispensationalists affirm the necessity for Jews to receive Jesus as Messiah, while also stressing that God has not forsaken those who are physically descended from Abraham through [[Isaac]]. They claim that God made unconditional covenants with Israel as a people and nation in the Abrahamic, Palestinian, [[Davidic line|Davidic]], and New Covenant.

==Judaism==
Christian dispensationalists sometimes endorse what some critics have pejoratively termed ''[[Philo-Semitism|Judeophilia]]'', ranging from endorsement of the state of Israel to observing traditional Jewish holidays and practicing traditionally Jewish religious rituals. (''See also'' [[Christian Zionism]], [[Jewish Christians]], [[Judaizers]], [[Hebrew Roots]], and [[Messianic Judaism]]). Dispensationalists typically endorse the modern state of Israel, consider its existence as a political entity as God revealing his will for the Last Days, and reject anti-Semitism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foigm.org/|title=Home - Friends of Israel|website=www.foigm.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Messianic Judaism===
Dispensationalists tend to have special interest in the Jews because the dispensationalist [[hermeneutics|hermeneutic]] honors Biblical passages that list Jews as among God's chosen people. Some [[Messianic Judaism|Messianic Jews]], however, reject dispensationalism in favor of related but distinct hermeneutics called [[Olive Tree Theology]].&lt;ref&gt;[[David H. Stern]], ''Messianic Jewish Manifesto'', ''The Complete Jewish Bible'', and ''The Jewish New Testament Commentary''&lt;!--specific pages?--&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; The name refers to the passages of Romans 11:17–18: "If some of the branches were broken off, and you, a wild olive, were grafted in among them and have become equal sharers in the rich root of the olive tree, then don't boast as if you were better than the branches!"

==United States politics==
Israel has allied with U.S. evangelicals and dispensationalists to influence [[foreign policy of the United States|U.S. foreign policy]], including protection of the Jewish people in Israel and continued [[Israel–United States relations|aid for the state of Israel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Evangelical Christians plead for Israel | last=Greene | first=Richard Allen | work= BBC News| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/5193092.stm | date= 2006-07-19| accessdate=2007-03-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Kirkpatrick |first=David |date=2006-11-14 |title=For Evangelicals, Supporting Israel Is 'God's Foreign Policy' |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/14/washington/14israel.html |work=New York Times |location=New York, NY |access-date=2018-05-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Israel's alliance with [[televangelist]] [[John Hagee]] began in the early 1980s as he met with every [[Prime Minister of Israel]] since [[Menachem Begin]]. Since the mid-2000s Israel has been in commercial alliance with televangelist and sometimes-politician [[Pat Robertson]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Israel Reconsiders Decision to Cut Ties With Pat Robertson |url=https://www.haaretz.com/1.5319260 |work=Haaretz |date=2006-01-15 |access-date=2018-10-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2005 Prime Minister [[Benjamin Netanyahu]] said, "I mean that we have no greater friend in the whole world than Pat Robertson."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/israel/2017/june/and-israel-a-friendship-thats-strong-and-steadfast |title=CBN and Israel: A Friendship That's Strong and Steadfast |last=Waage |first=John |date=2017-06-05 |website=cbn.com |publisher=[[Christian Broadcasting Network]] |access-date=2018-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Political commentator [[Kevin Phillips (political commentator)|Kevin Phillips]] claimed in ''American Theocracy'' (2006) that dispensationalist and other fundamentalist Christians, together with the [[oil lobby]], have provided political assistance for the invasion of Iraq during 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Phillips |first=Kevin |date=2006-03-21 |title=American Theocracy: The Peril and Politics of Radical Religion, Oil, and Borrowed Money in the 21stC entury |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0pU9z669ZwEC&amp;pg=PT87 |publisher=Penguin |page=87 |isbn=9781101218846 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Dun Ailline Druid Brotherhood''' (also known as '''Dun Ailline''' or '''HDDA''', ''Hermandad Druida Dun Ailline'' in Spanish) is a pagan organization for followers of the [[Celtic Neopaganism]] based on [[Spain]] in 2010, which supports the practice of a type of [[Celtic Reconstructionist Paganism]] called Druidism, centered on the [[Culture of Ireland|Celtic culture]] of [[Ireland]], and whose principal deities are known as the [[Tuatha Dé Danann]]. Its members consider themselves practitioners of a European native religion and they call themselves ''creidim'', a concept of Irish origin.

In Spain, the Dun Ailline Druidic Brotherhood is legally registered under the number and [[Irish language|Irish]] name 2854-SG/A – Traidisiún na Beannach Fia Mór – Irish Reconstructionist Druid Tradition, being one of the first neopagan religions legally recognized in Spain, traditionally a [[Catholic]] country, with other organizations like the ''Fintan Druidic Order'' and the ''Celtiberic Wicca'', among others.&lt;ref&gt;Druidism official religion in Spain: http://spain.pagannewswirecollective.com/dun-ailline-inicia-legalizacion/05414&lt;/ref&gt;

== Druidism ==
{{main|Celtic Reconstructionist Paganism|Neo-Druidism}}

[[File:Marta Vey, Dun Ailline Brotherhood.jpg|thumb|The Seanoir Marta Vey, celebrating one traditional offering.]]

The first revival of Druidism came from the hand of [[John Aubrey]] and [[John Toland]]. The September 21, 1716, day of the autumn equinox, the Druidic group of which John Toland was one of the members, was commissioned to proclaim symbolically at the top of [[Primrose Hill]], and "facing the eye of light" (the sun), the call, for all Druids that may exist around the world, the assembly that was to take place on September 22, 1717 in London in the Apple Tree Tavern, Charles st., Coven garden. At the same time calls were sent by messengers to the various 'Bosquets or Groves' that were known to still exist. The delegates of the Druidic bardic circles and represented at the meeting of September 22, 1717 came from bosquets, groves or circles so far as [[London]], [[York]], [[Oxford]], [[Wales]], [[Cornwall]], the [[Isle of Man]], [[Anglesey]], [[Scotland]], Ireland and [[Armorica]] in France, especially of the town of [[Nantes]].&lt;ref&gt;Podcast on Druidry in the spanish radio show Encrucijada Pagana, Radio Cerdanyola (Barcelona).

Subsequently, because of the Irish diaspora, a new nativist Druidic line, centered on the reconstructionism of the culture, spirituality and folklore of Ireland arises in [[United States]]. The ''creidim'' honor the deities known as [[Tuatha Dé Danann]], headed by [[Dagda|An Dagda]] and oldest Celtic deities like [[Cernunnos]]. The word ''creidim'' means believer in [[Gaeilge]].

== History ==
[[File:Dun Ailline Brotherhood 2.jpg|thumb|Dun Ailline Brotherhood, founded in 2010 by Marta Vey. In 2012 happens to be recognized as a religious organization by the Government of Spain.]]
After the disappearance of the [[Ord Draiochta Na Uisnech]] - ODU, Order made by [[Kenn R. White]], in 2009 closes the [[Grove Magh Mor]], "grove" in Spain that ODU dedicated to promoting the ''[[Tradition of the Great Stag]]''. In 2010 [[Marta Vey]] founded the ''Dun Ailline Druid Brotherhood'', in order to preserve and transmit the Tradition of the Great Stag. In the same year, 2010, a cultural association focused on the recreationism of Ireland in the 6th-9th centuries, whose purpose is to publicize their culture, customs and myths, was created.

In October 2012, HDDA becomes recognized as a religious denomination by the [[Government of Spain]].&lt;ref&gt;Meeting with the Deputy Director of Relations with the Confessions: http://spain.pagannewswirecollective.com/confesiones-religiosas-paganas-se-reunen-con-subdtor-relaciones-confesiones/10513&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Quote by Francisco Diez de Velasco in his Religions in Spain - Past and Present: https://books.google.com/books?id=NZlYiNocJAIC&amp;pg=PA54&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2012 was admitted as a full member of the Spanish Platform for Religious Freedom of Paganism,&lt;ref&gt;Meeting of the Pagan platform with the Foundation for Pluralism and Coexistence: https://plataformapagana.wordpress.com/2014/02/13/reunion-de-la-plataforma-pagana-con-la-fundacion-pluralismo-y-convivencia/&lt;/ref&gt; created with the purpose of obtaining legal rights to practitioners of pagan beliefs and serve as interlocutor with the Government of Spain.

In December 2014, the HDDA participates in the II Pagan Day held in L'[[Hospitalet de Llobregat]], ([[Barcelona]]).&lt;ref&gt;II Día del paganismo: http://diadelpaganisme.blogspot.com.es/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paganism and Modern Society (in spanish) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATA1YPJWNRQ&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The Warrior Way in the Irish Celtic Paganism, Ethics and Moral (in spanish)": https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3qER2Af95c&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structural organization ==

The organization is headed by the ''Ard droi / Ard Bandrui'' who legally represents the religious association, being also the religious leader of it.

HDDA base is formed by creidim. The priesthood is made by ''droi'' and ''Bandrui''. Any creidim can access the priestly preparation if you meet the requirements.

In 2014, the founder Marta Vey was named ''Ard Bandrui'' by the priestly assembly, and was ratified as legal and religious representative of HDDA.

The ''creidim '' are organized into local groups that meet for holding various celebrations.

'''Eroakirkosta.fi''' is a [[Finland|Finnish]] website which offers an electronic service for resigning from Finland's [[state church]]es; the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland]] and the [[Finnish Orthodox Church]]. "Eroa kirkosta" translates to "resign from the church".

The website was created by [[Freethinkers of Tampere]], an organisation that supports a formal [[separation of church and state]], and opened on 21 November 2003. The Finnish law on [[freedom of religion]] was updated on 1 August 2003 and then allowed resigning from religions without a visit to a bureau. Because eroakirkosta.fi is not maintained by [[magistrate]]s, the website can not directly resign a person from a church. Instead, the website forwards the filled-in resignation forms to magistrates who then complete the resignation. Resignations through [[e-mail]] are allowed because the Finnish law requires resignations to be "in writing" but not "[[Signature|signed]]". Eroakirkosta.fi also gives the user the alternative to print the resignation form and send it through regular [[mail]].

Eroakirkosta.fi became popular very quickly.

'''Exorcism in Christianity''' is the practice of casting out [[Christian demonology|demons]] from a person they are believed to have [[Demonic possession|possessed]]. The person performing the [[exorcism]], known as an [[exorcist]], is often a member of the [[Christian Church]], or an individual thought to be [[Grace (Christianity)|graced]] with special powers or skills. The exorcist may use prayers and religious material, such as set formulas, [[gesture]]s, [[symbol]]s, [[icon]]s, [[amulet]]s, etc. The exorcist often invokes [[God in Christianity|God]], [[Jesus in Christianity|Jesus]] and/or several different [[angel]]s and [[archangel]]s to intervene with the exorcism. A survey of Christian exorcists found that most exorcists believe that any mature Christian can perform an exorcism, not just members of [[clergy]]. Christian exorcists most commonly believe the authority given to them by the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit (the [[Trinity]]) is the source of their ability to cast out demons.&lt;ref&gt;Mohr, M. D., &amp; Royal, K. D. (2012). "Investigating the Practice of Christian Exorcism and the Methods Used to Cast out Demons", Journal of Christian Ministry, 4, p. 35. Available at: http://journalofchristianministry.org/article/view/10287/7073.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term became prominent in [[Early Christianity]] from the early [[Christianity in the 2nd century|2nd century]] onward.&lt;ref name="John Anthony McGuckin - Definition"&gt;{{cite book|url = https://books.google.com/?id=u4i8jv0b7IkC&amp;pg=PA138&amp;dq=orthodox+exorcism&amp;cd=20#v=onepage&amp;q=orthodox%20exorcism|quote= Exorcism From the Gree ''exorkizo'', "i adjure" (cf. Matt. 26:63), [[exorcism]] became a term prominent in early Christianity from the early 2nd century onward (cf. Justin, ''Dialogue with Trypho'' 76.6;85.2) as the casting out of devils.|title= The Westminster handbook to patristic theology|publisher =[[Westminster John Knox Press]]|accessdate = 2007-12-31|isbn = 978-0-664-22396-0|year = 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, [[Demonic possession|people considered to be possessed]] are not regarded as [[evil]] in themselves, nor wholly responsible for their actions, because possession is considered to be unwilling manipulation by a demon resulting in harm to self or others. Therefore, practitioners regard exorcism as more of a cure than a punishment.  The mainstream rituals usually take this into account, making sure that there is no violence to the possessed, only that they be tied down if there is potential for violence.&lt;ref&gt;Malachi M. (1976) Hostage to the Devil: the possession and exorcism of five living Americans. San Francisco, Harpercollins p.462 {{ISBN|0-06-065337-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Old Testament==
The ''Catholic Encyclopedia'' says that there is only one apparent case of demonic possession in the Old Testament, of King [[Saul]] being tormented by an "evil spirit" (1 Samuel 16:14), but it relies on an interpretation of the Hebrew word "rûah" as "evil spirit", an interpretation that is doubted by the ''Catholic Encyclopedia''.&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Demoniacal Possession}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Catholic Encyclopedia'' ties exorcism methods mentioned in extra-canonical Jewish literature to the driving off of a demon in the book of Tobias.&lt;ref name="CathEncy|wstitle=Exorcism"&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Exorcism}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some theologians such as Ángel Manuel Rodríguez say that [[Mediumship|mediums]] like the ones mentioned in Leviticus 20:27 were possessed by demons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|author=Ángel Manuel Rodríguez|title=Old Testament demonology|journal=Ministry: International Journal for Pastors|volume=1998 (7:6)|pp=5-7|url=https://www.ministrymagazine.org/archive/1998/06/old-testament-demonology|accessdate=October 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==New Testament==
{{See also|Miracles of Jesus#Exorcisms}}
Christian exorcism is founded on the belief that Jesus commanded his followers to expel evil spirits in [[Names and titles of Jesus in the New Testament|his name]].&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Matthew|10:1}},{{bibleverse||Matthew|10:8}}; {{bibleverse||Mark|6:7}}; {{bibleverse||Luke|9:1}}{{bibleverse-nb||Luke|10:17}}, {{bibleverse||Mark|16:17}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Catholic Encyclopedia]] article on Exorcism, Jesus points to this ability as a sign of his [[Messiah]]ship, and he empowered his [[Disciple (Christianity)|disciples]] to do the same.&lt;ref name="CathEncy|wstitle=Exorcism"/&gt;

The [[Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod]] traces the practice of exorcism to the Scriptural claim that [[Jesus Christ]] expelled demons with a simple command (Mark 1:23–26; 9:14–29; Luke 11:14–26).&lt;ref name="LCMS-Exorcism"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.lcms.org/ca/www/cyclopedia/02/display.asp?t1=E&amp;word=EXORCISM| title = Exorcism|publisher = Lutheran Church Missouri Synod|accessdate = 2009-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Apostle (Christian)|apostles]] continued the practice with the power and in the name of Jesus (Matthew 10:1; Acts 19:11–16).&lt;ref name="LCMS-Exorcism"/&gt;

The [[Jewish Encyclopedia]] article on Jesus states that Jesus, "was devoted especially to casting out demons," and also believed that he passed this on to his followers; however, "his superiority to his followers was shown by his casting out demons which they had failed to expel."&lt;ref&gt;[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=254&amp;letter=J&amp;search=jesus%20casting%20out%20demons#998 JewishEncyclopedia.com - JESUS OF NAZARETH&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Early church===
[[St. Cyril of Jerusalem]] wrote, "Receive the exorcisms with devotion...Divine exorcisms, borrowed from the Scripture, purify the soul."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url = https://books.google.com/?id=J7abX63aB4IC&amp;pg=PA44&amp;dq=orthodox+exorcism&amp;cd=16#v=onepage&amp;q=orthodox%20exorcism|title=Orthodox Spirituality: An Outline of the Orthodox Ascetical and Mystical Tradition|quote=St. Cyril of Jerusalem writes: "Receive the exorcisms with devotion...Divine exorcisms, borrowed from the Scripture, purify the soul."|publisher =[[St Vladimir's Seminary Press]]|accessdate = 2007-12-31|isbn = 978-0-913836-51-4|year = 1978}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Middle Ages===
[[File:St. Francis Borgia Helping a Dying Impenitent by Goya.jpg|right|thumb|Painting by [[Francisco Goya]] of [[Saint Francis Borgia]] performing an exorcism.]]

The [[Order of Saint Benedict|Benedictine]] ''[[Vade retro satana]]'' was used in the medieval era.

In the 15th century, Catholic [[exorcists]] were both clerical and [[layman|lay]], since every Christian has the power to command demons and drive them out in the name of Christ.&lt;ref name="Moshe Sluhovsky - Lay Exorcists"&gt;{{cite book|url = https://books.google.com/?id=fPGyeVQfgCUC&amp;pg=PA43&amp;dq=orthodox+exorcism&amp;cd=12#v=onepage&amp;q=lay%20exorcist|title=Believe Not Every Spirit: Possession, Mysticism, &amp; Discernment in Early Modern Catholicism|quote= ...[[Johannes Nider]] and [[Heinrich Kramer]] found nothing wrong with the performance of exorcism by laypeople, as long as they did not usurp the clerical rite, which included some prayers only a priest could pronounce. Every Christian, Nider reminded his readers, had the power to command demons and drive them out in the name of Christ, but lay exorcists should be extremely careful not to use unknown characters and charms, and should be aware that the only mode to adjure demons is the imperative and never the supplicative.|publisher =[[University Of Chicago Press]]|accessdate = 2007-12-31|isbn = 978-0-226-76282-1|year = 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reformation===
After the [[Protestant Reformation]], [[Martin Luther]] abbreviated the Roman ritual used for exorcism.&lt;ref name="Christian Classics Ethereal Library-Exorcism"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.ccel.org/s/schaff/encyc/encyc04/htm/ii.vii.htm| title = Exorcism|publisher = Christian Classics Ethereal Library|accessdate = 2009-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1526, the ritual was further abbreviated and the [[Insufflation|exsufflation]] was omitted. This form of the ''Lutheran Ritual for Exorcism'' was incorporated into the majority of the Lutheran service-books and implemented.&lt;ref name="Christian Classics Ethereal Library-Exorcism"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ferber|first=Sarah|title=Demonic possession and exorcism in early modern France|year=2004 |publisher=Routledge|page=38|url=https://books.google.com/?id=DNS5oatndpUC&amp;pg=PA38&amp;lpg=PA38&amp;dq=exorcism+lutheran|accessdate=2009-05-25|isbn=0-415-21265-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current beliefs and practices==

===Anglicanism===

====Church of England====
In 1974, the Church of England set up the "[[Deliverance ministry]]".&lt;ref name=batty1/&gt; As part of its creation, every [[diocese]] in the country was equipped with a team trained in both exorcism and psychiatry. According to its representatives, most cases brought before it have conventional explanations, and actual exorcisms are quite rare; blessings, though, are sometimes given to people for psychological reasons.&lt;ref name=batty1&gt;{{cite news
 | last = Batty | first = David  | date = 2001-05-02
 | url = https://www.theguardian.com/society/2001/may/02/socialcare.mentalhealth1| title = Exorcism: abuse or cure? | work = Guardian Unlimited | accessdate = 2007-12-29
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anglican [[priests]] may not perform an exorcism without permission from the Diocesan [[bishop]]. An exorcism is not usually performed unless the bishop and his team of specialists (including a [[psychiatrist]] and [[physician]]) have approved it.

====Episcopal Church====
In the [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopal Church]], the ''Book of Occasional Services'' discusses provision for exorcism; but it does not indicate any specific rite, nor does it establish an office of "exorcist".&lt;ref&gt;"Concerning Exorcism", ''Book of Occasional Services'', Church Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; Diocesan exorcists usually continue in their role when they have retired from all other church duties.

=== Baptists ===
[[Albert Mohler]], the ninth president of the [[Southern Baptist Theological Seminary]], states that [[Baptist]]s, among other [[evangelical Christians]], do {{quotation|believe in the existence, malevolence, and power of the Devil and demons. About these things, the New Testament is abundantly clear. We must resist any effort to 'demythologize' the New Testament in order to deny the existence of these evil forces and beings. At the same time, we must recognize quickly that the Devil and demons are not accorded the powers often ascribed to them in popular piety. The Devil is indeed a threat, as Peter made clear when he warned: 'Be sober-minded; be watchful. Your adversary the devil prowls around like a roaring lion, seeking someone to devour.' [1 Peter 5:8] The New Testament is also clear that very real cases of demonic possession were encountered by Jesus and his followers. Jesus liberated afflicted individuals as he commanded the demons to flee, and they obeyed him. Likewise, the Apostle Paul performed exorcisms as he confronted the powers of evil and darkness in his ministry. A closer look at the crucial passages involved reveals no rite of exorcism, however, just the name of Jesus and the proclamation of the Gospel. Likewise, there is no notion of a priestly ministry of ordained exorcists in the New Testament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=On Exorcism and Exorcists: An Evangelical View|last=Mohler|first=Albert|date=15 November 2010|publisher=Southern Baptist Convention|accessdate=5 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
As a result of this theology, for the Baptist Christian, the weapons of "warfare are spiritual, and the powers that the forces of darkness most fear are the name of Jesus, the authority of the Bible, and the power of his Gospel."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=On Exorcism and Exorcists: An Evangelical View|last=Mohler|first=Albert|date=15 November 2010|publisher=Southern Baptist Convention|accessdate=5 May 2014|quote=The weapons of our warfare are spiritual, and the powers that the forces of darkness most fear are the name of Jesus, the authority of the Bible, and the power of his Gospel.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Catholicism===

{{main|Exorcism in the Catholic Church}}
In Catholic [[dogma]] exorcism is a [[sacramentals|sacramental]] but not a [[Sacraments of the Catholic Church|sacrament]], unlike [[baptism]] or [[Confession (religion)|confession]].  Unlike a sacrament, exorcism's "integrity and efficacy do not depend ... on the rigid use of an unchanging formula or on the ordered sequence of prescribed actions.  Its efficacy depends on two elements: authorization from valid and licit Church authorities, and the faith of the exorcist."&lt;ref&gt;Martin M. (1976) ''Hostage to the Devil: The Possession and Exorcism of Five Contemporary Americans''. Harper San Francisco.  Appendix one "The Roman Ritual of Exorcism" p.459 {{ISBN|0-06-065337-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Catholic Church revised the Rite of Exorcism in January 1999, though the traditional Rite of Exorcism in [[Latin]] is allowed as an option. The act of exorcism is considered to be an incredibly dangerous spiritual task. The ritual assumes that possessed persons retain their free will, though the demon may hold control over their physical body, and involves prayers, blessings, and invocations with the use of the document ''[[Of Exorcisms and Certain Supplications]]''. In the modern era, Catholic bishops rarely authorize exorcisms, approaching would-be cases with the presumption that mental or physical illness is more likely.

Solemn exorcisms, according to the [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|Canon law]] of the church, can be exercised only by an ordained priest (or higher prelate), with the express permission of the local bishop, and only after a careful medical examination to exclude the possibility of mental illness,&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.ewtn.com/library/prayer/roman2.txt THE ROMAN RITUAL Translated by PHILIP T. WELLER, S.T.D.]&lt;/ref&gt; and in the ritual people cannot in any circumstance be harmed. The ''Catholic Encyclopedia'' (1908) enjoined: "Superstition ought not to be confounded with religion, however much their history may be interwoven, nor magic, however white it may be, with a legitimate religious rite." Things listed in the [[Roman Ritual]] as being indicators of possible demonic possession include: speaking foreign or ancient languages of which the possessed has no prior knowledge; supernatural abilities and strength; knowledge of hidden or remote things which the possessed has no way of knowing; an aversion to anything holy; and profuse [[blasphemy]] and/or [[sacrilege]].

Fr. [[Gabriele Amorth]], who claimed to have performed 160,000 exorcisms, said exorcists have the ability to detect an evil presence.  However, he notes that "they are not always right: their 'feelings' must be checked out."  In his examples, they are able to detect the events that caused the demon to enter, or are able to discover the evil object that has cursed the individual.  He notes that "they are always humble."&lt;ref&gt;Amorth G. (1990) An Exorcist Tells His Story. tns. MacKenzie N. Ignatius Press: San Francisco. pp157-160 {{ISBN|0898707102}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Eastern Orthodoxy ===

=== Lutheranism ===
The [[Lutheran Church]] traces the practice of exorcism to the Scriptural claim that [[Jesus Christ]] expelled demons with a simple command (Mark 1:23–26; 9:14–29; Luke 11:14–26).&lt;ref name="LCMS-Exorcism"/&gt; The [[Apostle (Christian)|apostles]] continued the practice with the power and in the name of Jesus (Matthew 10:1; Acts 19:11–16).&lt;ref name="LCMS-Exorcism"/&gt; Contrary to some [[Christian denomination|denominations]] of [[Christianity]], Lutheranism affirms that the individual, both the believer and the non-believer, can be plagued by demons, based on several arguments, including the one that "just as a believer, whom Jesus Christ has delivered from sin (Romans 6:18), can still be bound by sin in his life, so he can still be bound by a demon in his life."&lt;ref name="Kaohsiung Lutheran Mission-Exorcism"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://johnsmith.asia/can_christians.htm| title = Can a Christian Have a Demon?|publisher = Kaohsiung Lutheran Mission|accessdate = 2009-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Protestant Reformation]], [[Martin Luther]] abbreviated the Roman ritual used for exorcism.&lt;ref name="Christian Classics Ethereal Library-Exorcism"/&gt; In 1526, the ritual was further abbreviated and the [[Insufflation|exsufflation]] was omitted. This form of the ''Lutheran Ritual for Exorcism'' was incorporated into the majority of the Lutheran service-books and implemented.&lt;ref name="Christian Classics Ethereal Library-Exorcism"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ferber-Lutheran Exorcism"&gt;{{cite book |last=Ferber|first=Sarah|title=Demonic possession and exorcism in early modern France|year=2004 |publisher=Routledge|page=38|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DNS5oatndpUC&amp;pg=PA38&amp;lpg=PA38&amp;dq=exorcism+lutheran&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Fu9K0BClts&amp;sig=2VDybAx064WNAL03kxu5jm1tr_E&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=NdMcSo7VMZGMNeejtJUP&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10#PPA38,M1|accessdate=2009-05-25|isbn=0-415-21265-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a Pastoral Handbook of the [[Lutheran Church]], 
{{quote|In general, satanic possession is nothing other than an action of the devil by which, from God's permission, men are urged to sin, and he occupies their bodies, in order that they might lose eternal salvation. Thus bodily possession is an action by which the devil, from divine permission, possesses both pious and impious men in such a way that he inhabits their bodies not only according to activity, but also according to essence, and torments them, either for the punishment or for the discipline and testing of men, and for the glory of divine justice, mercy, power, and wisdom.&lt;ref name="Christian Classics Ethereal Library-Exorcism"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mayes-Lutheran Exorcism"/&gt;}}

These pastoral manuals warn that often, symptoms such as ecstasy, epileptic seizures, lethargy, insanity, and a frantic state of mind, are the results of natural causes and should not be mistaken for [[demon possession]].&lt;ref name="Mayes-Lutheran Exorcism"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.angelfire.com/ny4/djw/lutherantheology.demonpossession.html| title = Quotes and Paraphrases from Lutheran Pastoral Handbooks of the 16th and 17th Centuries on the Topic of Demon Possession|publisher = David Jay Webber|accessdate = 2009-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Lutheran Church, primary symptoms that may indicate demon possession and the need of an exorcism include:
#The knowledge of secret things, for example, being able to predict the future (Acts 16:16), find lost people or things, or know complex things that one has never learned (e.g., medicine). It is said that fortune-tellers often ask a spirit for help and that this spirit gives them certain powers. In that case, the evil spirit is assisting, not necessarily possessing the person bodily.&lt;ref name="Mayes-Lutheran Exorcism"/&gt;
#The knowledge of languages one has never learned. Just as the devil can bind one's tongue (Luke 11:14), it is reported from the early church as well as the time of the Reformation that certain demon-possessed people could speak languages they had never learned.&lt;ref name="Mayes-Lutheran Exorcism"/&gt;
#Supernatural strength (Mark 5:2-3), far beyond what they previously had or should have considering their sex and size. Much caution in judging demon possession is required. All of the circumstances and symptoms must be taken into consideration. Insanity should not be confused with possession. On the other hand, possession may be taking place even where these symptoms are absent.&lt;ref name="Mayes-Lutheran Exorcism"/&gt;
The Church lists the secondary symptoms of horrible shouting (Mark 5:5), [[blasphemy]] of [[Holy Trinity|God]] and jeering at one's neighbor, deformation of movements (e.g. ferocious movements, facial contortion, immodest laughing, gnashing of teeth, spitting, removing clothes, lacerating self, Mk. 9:20; Lk. 8:27.), inhuman revelry (e.g. when they take food beyond the capability of nature), torment of bodies, unusual injuries of the body and of those nearby, extraordinary motion of bodies (e.g., an elderly man who, being demon-possessed, was able to run as fast as a horse), and forgetfulness of things done.&lt;ref name="Mayes-Lutheran Exorcism"/&gt; Other symptoms include the corruption of reason in man, which make him like an animal, melancholy, the acceleration of death (Mark 9:18 [suicide attempts]), and the presence of other supernatural occurrences.&lt;ref name="Mayes-Lutheran Exorcism"/&gt;

After these determinations have been made, the Church recommends experienced physicians to determine whether there is a medical explanation for the behaviour of the individual.&lt;ref name="Mayes-Lutheran Exorcism"/&gt; When a true possession is recognized, the poor one is to be committed to the care of a [[Minister (Christianity)|minister of the Church]] who teaches sound doctrine, is of a blameless life, who does nothing for the sake of filthy lucre, but does everything from the soul.&lt;ref name="Mayes-Lutheran Exorcism"/&gt; The pastor is then to diligently inquire what kind of life the possessed one led up to this point and lead him or her through the law to the recognition of his [[sins]].&lt;ref name="Mayes-Lutheran Exorcism"/&gt; After this admonition or consolation has taken place, the works of a natural physician are to be used, who will cleanse the possessed one from malicious fluids with the appropriate medicines.&lt;ref name="Mayes-Lutheran Exorcism"/&gt; The Pastoral Handbook then states:
{{quote|
*Let ardent prayers be poured forth to God, not only by the ministers of the Church, but also by the whole Church. Let these prayers be conditioned, if the liberation should happen for God's glory and the salvation of the possessed person, for this is an evil of the body.
*With the prayers let [[fasting]] be joined, see Matthew 17:21.
*[[Alms]] by friends of the possessed person, Tobit 12:8-9.
*Let the [[Confession of faith|confession of the Christian faith]] be once required of Him, let him be taught concerning the works of the devil destroyed by Christ, let him be sent back faithfully to this Destroyer of Satan, Jesus Christ, let an exhortation be set up to faith in Christ, to prayers, to [[penitence]].&lt;ref name="Mayes-Lutheran Exorcism"/&gt;}}

===Mennonites===
Many [[Mennonite]] colleges and seminaries include training for the ministry of exorcism. The Mennonite minister and exorcist Dean Hochstetler states that [[Pow-wow (folk magic)|powwowing]], a practice done by some in the [[Pennsylvania Dutch]] community, "brings people under bondage to Satan."&lt;ref name="Kriebel2007"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kriebel|first=David W.|title=Powwowing Among the Pennsylvania Dutch: A Traditional Medical Practice in the Modern World|year=2007|publisher=Penn State Press|isbn=9780271032139|page=204|quote=Mennonites of the Lancaster Conference "seem to think that it's black magic and related to the devil and just don't think it's very good."

===Methodism===
The [[British Methodist Church]] holds that the ritual of exorcism involves "the casting out of an objective power of evil which has gained possession of a person."&lt;ref name="The Methodist Church-Exorcism (1)"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Methodist Conference - Friday 25th June, 1976 (Preston)|quote=...the casting out of an objective power of evil which has gained possession of a person.|publisher = The Methodist Church of Great Britain|accessdate = 2008-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the Methodist Church teaches that "the authority to exorcise has been given to the Church as one of the ways in which Christ's Ministry is continued in the world."&lt;ref name="The Methodist Church-Exorcism (2)"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Methodist Conference - Friday 25th June, 1976 (Preston)|quote=...the authority to exorcise has been given to the Church as one of the ways in which Christ's Ministry is continued in the world.|publisher = The Methodist Church of Great Britain|accessdate = 2008-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Minister (Christianity)|minister]] must first consult the District Chair in order to perform an exorcism.&lt;ref name="The Methodist Church-Exorcism (3)"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Methodist Conference - Friday 25th June, 1976 (Preston)|quote=The form of any service of healing for those believed to be possessed should be considered in consultation with the ministerial staff of the circuit (or in one-minister circuits with those whom the Chairman of the District suggests).|publisher = The Methodist Church of Great Britain|accessdate = 2008-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Methodist Church holds that it is of great importance to ensure that the presence and love of Christ is assured to the individual(s) seeking help.&lt;ref name="The Methodist Church-Exorcism (4)"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Methodist Conference - Friday 25th June, 1976 (Preston)|quote=Since pastoral guidance is first and foremost concerned to assure the presence and love of Christ, it is important to follow this practice in these cases also.|publisher = The Methodist Church of Great Britain|accessdate =2008-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the ministry of the "Bible, prayer and sacraments" should be extended to these individuals as well.&lt;ref name="The Methodist Church-Exorcism (5)"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Methodist Conference - Friday 25th June, 1976 (Preston)|quote=The ministry of bible, prayer and sacraments should be extended to those seeking help. |publisher = The Methodist Church of Great Britain|accessdate = 2008-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; A combination of these things has been proven to be effective.&lt;ref name="Westminster Methodist Central Hall-Exorcism"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.methodist-central-hall.org.uk/sermons/MartinTurnerSermons/ExorcismIn2006.pdf| title = Exorcism in 2006|publisher = Westminster Methodist Central Hall (Rev.

For example, in one particular situation, a Roman Catholic woman believed that her house was haunted, and therefore consulted her [[Priesthood (Catholic Church)|priest]] for assistance. Since he was not available to drive the [[demons]] from the woman's home, she contacted a Methodist pastor, who exorcised the evil spirits from a room, which was believed to be the source of distress in the house, and celebrated [[Holy Communion]] in the same place;&lt;ref name="Westminster Methodist Central Hall-Exorcism"/&gt; following these actions, there was no longer any problem in the house.&lt;ref name="Westminster Methodist Central Hall-Exorcism"/&gt; In another situation, The Reverend Jay Bartlett writes that a young lady who was involved with "drug abuse, self mutilation, severe abuse, mental torment, Satanism, occult activity, communion with demons, and other evils" was exorcised at Mt. Olive Free Methodist Church in [[Dallas]] over a period of seven nights, with "[[anointing oil]], the Word of God (the sword of the Spirit), [[holy water]], the sacred symbols of the cross, the [[blood of Christ]], and consecrated materials [being] utilized to drive out the demons."&lt;ref name="Ford2010"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ford|first1=Christopher |last2=Ford|first2=Nataley|title=Demons, Deliverance and Dissociation|date=31 January 2010|isbn=9781445276359|page=154}}&lt;!--|accessdate=5 May 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oriental Orthodoxy===
In the [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church]], priests intervene and perform exorcisms on behalf of those believed to be afflicted by demons or ''[[buda (folk religion)|buda]]''.  According to a 2010 [[Pew Research Center]] study, 74% of Christians in Ethiopia claim to have experienced or witnessed an exorcism.&lt;ref name="bbc2010-04-15"&gt;{{cite news |title=Ten things we have learnt about Africa |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/8620249.stm |publisher=[[BBC News]] |date=April 15, 2010 |accessdate=April 15, 2010 |quote="In Ethiopia, 74% of Christians say they have experienced or witnessed the devil or evil spirits being driven out of a person"}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Demon-possessed persons are brought to a church or prayer meeting.&lt;ref name="geleta"&gt;Geleta, Amsalu Tadesse. "[http://www.lausanne.org/all-documents/ethiopian-case-study.html Case Study: Demonization and the Practice of Exorcism in Ethiopian Churches] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100101104543/http://www.lausanne.org/all-documents/ethiopian-case-study.html |date=2010-01-01 }}".  Lausanne Committee for World Evangelization, Nairobi, August 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;  Often, when an ill person has not responded to modern medical treatment, the affliction is attributed to demons.&lt;ref name="geleta" /&gt;  Unusual or especially perverse deeds, particularly when performed in public, are symptomatic of a demoniac.&lt;ref name="geleta" /&gt;  Superhuman strength – such as breaking one's bindings, as described in the New Testament accounts – along with [[glossolalia]] are observed in the afflicted.&lt;ref name="geleta" /&gt;  Amsalu Geleta, in a modern case study, relates elements that are common to Ethiopian Christian exorcisms:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
It includes singing praise and victory songs, reading from the Scripture, prayer and confronting the spirit in the name of Jesus. Dialogue with the spirit is another important part of the exorcism ceremony. It helps the counselor (exorcist) to know how the spirit was operating in the life of the demoniac. The signs and events mentioned by the spirit are affirmed by the victim after deliverance.&lt;ref name="geleta" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The exorcism is not always successful, and Geleta notes another instance in which the usual methods were unsuccessful, and the demons apparently left the subject at a later time.  In any event, "in all cases the spirit is commanded in no other name than the name of Jesus."&lt;ref name="geleta" /&gt;

===Pentecostalism===
In the [[Pentecostal Church]], [[Charismatic Movement]], and other the less formalized sections of Christianity, the exorcism ritual can take many forms and belief structures. The most common of these is the [[Deliverance ministry|deliverance ceremony]]. Deliverance differs from the exorcism ceremony in that the Devil may have gotten a foothold into a person's life rather than gaining complete control . If complete control has been gained, a full-fledged exorcism is necessary.  However, a "spirit-filled Christian" cannot be possessed, based on their beliefs.  Within this belief structure, the reasons for the devil to get a foothold are usually explained to be some sort of deviation from theological doctrine or because of pre-conversion activities (like dealing with the occult).&lt;ref&gt;Poloma M. (1982) The Charismatic Movement: is there a new Pentecost? p97 {{ISBN|0805797211}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cuneo M. (2001) American Exorcism: Expelling Demons in the Land of Plenty. Doubleday: New York. pp.111-128 {{ISBN|0385501765}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The traditional method for determining if a person needs a deliverance is done by having someone present who has the gift of discerning of spirits.  This is a gift of the Holy Spirit from 1 Corinthians 12 that allows a person to "sense" in some way an evil presence.&lt;ref&gt;Poloma M. (1982) The Charismatic Movement: is there a new Pentecost? p60 {{ISBN|0-8057-9721-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the initial diagnosis is usually uncontested by the congregation, when many people are endowed with this gift in a single congregation, results may vary.&lt;ref&gt;Cuneo M. (2001) American Exorcism: Expelling Demons in the Land of Plenty. Doubleday: New York. pp.118-119 {{ISBN|0-385-50176-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Critics of exorcism contend that so-called 'possession' is often, in fact, undiagnosed mental illness and the performance of an exorcism in such cases exacerbates the condition and can even be considered abuse.&lt;ref&gt;

'''Gender in Bible translation''' concerns various issues, such as the [[gender of God]] and [[generic antecedent]]s in reference to [[person|people]]. Many in today’s churches have become conscious of and concerned about sexism.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite news | author = Bruce Metzger | url = http://www.ncccusa.org/newbtu/reader.html | title = Preface to the NRSV | accessdate = 2015-07-29 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100206062332/http://www.ncccusa.org/newbtu/reader.html | archivedate = 2010-02-06 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bruce Metzger]] states the English language is so biased towards the male gender that it may restrict and obscure meaning from original languages. The [[New Revised Standard Version|New Revised Standard Version (NRSV)]] was one of the first major translations to adopt [[gender-neutral language]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;  The King James Version translated at least one passage using a technique that many now reject in other translations, "Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called the children of God" (Matt. 5:9). The Greek word υἱοὶ that appears in the original is usually translated as "sons", but in this passage the translators chose to use the term "children" that included both genders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.equip.org/article/the-inclusive-language-debate/ |title=The Inclusive Language Debate |last1=Strauss  |first1=Mark  |last2=Wegener |first2=David |date=2009 |website=Christian Research Institute | publisher= |accessdate=2015-07-29 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Opponents of gender neutral language believe that readers who are not familiar with the original languages, can be influenced by a compromised meaning they believe is feminist.&lt;ref name=gnbc&gt;{{cite book |last=Poythress |first=Vern and Wayne Grudem  |date=2000 |title=The Gender-Neutral Bible Controversy: Muting the Masculinity of God's Words  |url= |location= |publisher=Broadman and Holman Publishers |page=149 |isbn=0-8054-2441-5 }}&lt;!--|accessdate=2015-07-29 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two translations that are particularly notable for their efforts to take radical steps in this regard, both explaining their reasons and their techniques in their front matter.  The titles of the two translations are similar, but the two translations are distinct. The first is ''[[The Inclusive New Testament]]'' (1994), the second is ''[[The New Testament and Psalms: an Inclusive Version]]'' (1995).  The first one deliberately tried to make the text agree with their creed, pointing out that when they saw problems with the message of the text "it becomes our license to introduce ''[[midrash]]'' into the text" (p. xxi). It is an original translation. The second one, however, is based on the NRSV, making changes as the editorial team saw fit, but being less radical to change the message of the original.{{fact|date=July 2015}} 

==Translation of the names of God==
There are a number of ways to translate the names of God into English from [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]. Hebrew uses only four consonants for the name—''Yod-Heh-Waw-Heh'' (יהוה, YHWH)—hence it is called the [[Tetragrammaton]]. Some modern English bibles render this as ''L&lt;small&gt;ORD&lt;/small&gt;''—''L'' capital, and ''ord'' in small capital font face. Others use ''Yahweh'', and the old [[King James Version]] used ''Jehovah''. In English, outside Bible translations, the tetragrammaton is often written as ''YHWH'' or ''YHVH''.

The original meaning of this form is connected with the "I AM" of Exodus 3:14 (and it probably contains a Hebrew masculine verb prefix—the ''Y'' or ''yod''). Sometimes this word is rendered into English by using Hebrew ''Adonai'', instead of attempting to directly translate ''YHWH'', following an ancient Jewish custom of respect.

The Hebrew word ''Adonai'' literally means ''my lord'' (with pseudo-plural), and is usually translated as ''Lord''. The Hebrew names ''Elohim'', ''El'', ''Shaddai'', and ''Yah'' are usually translated as ''God''—with ''Elohim'' being the most common. ''Elyon'' translates as ''Most High''.

There are a number of compound names for God. ''YHVH Tzevaot'' is translated as ''Lord of Hosts''. ''YHVH Elohe tzevaot'' would be ''Lord God of Hosts''. Among non-Orthodox Jews, there is a growing tendency to avoid the gender-in-English-language debate, and to simultaneously reclaim the vocabulary of Hebrew itself, by not translating these names in English prayers.

An example of a traditional translation is:
*"The earth belongs to the Lord, and all it contains; the world and its inhabitants." ([[Psalms|Psalm 24]])
An alternative translation is:
*"The earth belongs to Adonai, and all it contains; the world and its inhabitants."

=== Third person pronouns for God ===
Many prayers use one or more of the names for God many times within the same paragraph. The first time it appears a proper name is used, while further instances use a third person pronoun (he, she or it). English speakers usually use masculine or feminine third person pronouns to refer to people, and the third person pronoun—"it"—to refer to non-people. Traditionally, in Jewish, Christian, and Muslim writing, the third-person pronoun "He" has been used to refer to God in English translations.  In non-religious contexts, English speakers have generally used the word "he" as a substitute for a gender-neutral third person pronoun.

The idea of God being an "It" rather than a "he" or "she" does have some support in Jewish, Christian and Islamic rationalist medieval thought, much of which was based on [[Aristotelian view of God|Neo-Aristotelian]] philosophy. Some medieval philosophers of all three of these religions took great pains to make clear that God was in no way like a person, and that all apparently physical descriptions of God were only poetic metaphors.

In the [[Chinese language]], translators of the Christian Bible have created a new [[Chinese character]] to act as a divine pronoun: 祂 ([[Pinyin]]: ''tā''). ''Tā'', in essence, is the universal third person pronoun for all objects and persons. However, personhood (as well as gender) can be distinguished in writing. The normal pronoun for ''he'', 他, is also used in generic cases. The [[radical (Chinese character)|radical]] 亻(''rén'') marks personhood (distinct from non-human referents), not simply gender alone. The radical in 祂, 礻(''shì''), marks the "elevated personhood" of divinity, without implying anything about the gender of the divinity referred to.{{fact|date=July 2018}}

[[File:Rajasthan Girl Traditional Dress.jpg|thumb|A Hindu woman with a ghoonghat veil]]
A '''ghoonghat''' (''ghunghat'', ''ghunghta'', ''ghumta'', ''odhni'', ''laaj'', ''chunari'', ''jhund'') is a [[veil]] or [[headscarf]] worn by some married Hindu, and Jain women to cover their head, and often their face. Generally ''aanchal'' or  ''pallu'', the loose end of a [[sari]] is pulled over the head and face to act as a ghunghat. A ''[[dupatta]]'' (long scarf) is also commonly used as a ghungat. Today, facial veiling by Hindu women as part of everyday attire is now mostly limited to the Hindi-speaking areas of India.&lt;ref&gt;Raj Mohini Sethi (2011) "Socio-economic Profile of Rural India (series II).", p.111&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;IHDS 2004–5 data "Gender and Family Dynamics.", p.153&lt;/ref&gt;

Facial veiling is not sanctioned in Hinduism, Jainism, and Buddhism but some sections of the society from the 1st century B.C. advocated the use of the veil for married women, which came to be known as ghoonghat.&lt;ref&gt;Anant Sadashiv Altekar (1959) "The Position of Women in Hindu Civilization.", p.174&lt;/ref&gt; It has been both romanticized and criticized in religious and folk literature.&lt;ref&gt;Anant Sadashiv Altekar (1959) "The Position of Women in Hindu Civilization.", p.171&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The word ''ghoongat'', ''ghunghat'' or ''ghunghta'' is derived from ''Avagunthana'' ([[Sanskrit]]: अवगुण्ठन) meaning ''veil'', ''hiding'' and ''cloak'' and ''Oguntheti'' ([[Pali]]: ओगुन्थेति)  ''to cover'', ''veil over'' and ''hide''.&lt;ref&gt;http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?tinput=avaguNThana&amp;script=&amp;direction=SE&amp;link=yes&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ambalaṅgoḍa Polvattē Buddhadatta, A. P. (1957) "Concise Pāli-English Dictionary.", p.69&lt;/ref&gt; 

==History==
[[File:22 A standing woman in floral patterned white sari, a peacock-plume patterned cloak. 18 centiry, San Diego Museum of Art.jpg|thumb| Women in veiling, Rajput miniature painting.]] 

The ''ghoongat'', ''ghunghat'' or ''ghunghta'' veil evolved from ancient ''Avagunthana'' in ([[Sanskrit]]: अवगुण्ठन) ''veil'', ''hiding'' and ''cloak''.&lt;ref&gt;http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?tinput=avaguNThana&amp;script=&amp;direction=SE&amp;link=yes&lt;/ref&gt; Early Sanskrit literature has a wide vocabulary of terms for the veils used by women, such as ''avagunthana'' meaning cloak-veil, ''uttariya'' meaning shoulder-veil, ''mukha-pata'' meaning face-veil, and ''sirovas-tra'' meaning head-veil.&lt;ref&gt;Govind Sadashiv Ghurye (1951) "Indian Costume.", p.236&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ramesh Prasad Mohapatra (1992) "Fashion Styles of Ancient India: A Study of Kalinga from Earliest Times to Sixteenth Century AD", p.24&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Valmiki]]'s ''[[Ramayana]]'' dated between the 5th century BCE to the first century BCE, Prince [[Rama]] asks his wife [[Sita]] to unveil herself so that the gathered citizens of Ayodhya can take a look at them before they go in exile to the forest; there is no mention of [[Sita]] veiling herself again after this incident.&lt;ref&gt;Anjani Kant (1951) "Women and the Law.", p.43&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the epic, hearing the news of Ravana's death, his queens giving up to lamentations rush outside without their ''Avagunthana'', in which chief queen [[Mandodari]] surrounding his corpse says "''Why do you not get angry, beholding me, having put off my veil, walk out on foot by the city gate? Do you behold your wives who have thrown off their veils. Why are you not angry seeing them all come out of the city?''"&lt;ref name="Valmiki Ramanaya, chapter 111"&gt; Valmiki Ramanaya, chapter 111 - stanza 6-111-63 and 6-111-64&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, it is notable that royal women avoided public gaze and veiling was expected to be worn only by married women.&lt;ref&gt;Anjani Kant (1951) "Women and the Law.", p.43&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Śūdraka]], the author of [[Mṛcchakatika]] set in the fifth century BC, said that the ''Avagaunthaha'' was not used by women everyday and at every time. He said that a married lady was expected to put on a veil while moving in the public. This may indicate that it was not necessary for unmarried females to put on a veil.&lt;ref&gt;Sulochana Ayyar (1987) "Costumes and Ornaments as Depicted in the Sculptures of Gwalior Museum.", p.152&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Mṛcchakatika]] written in 3rd century BCE, courtesan [[Vasantasena]]'s mother, having received ornaments for her daughter from a wealthy suitor to keep her as his mistress, she sends Vasantasena with her maid, asks her to go in the carriage bedecked with ornaments and to put on her ''avagunthana'' veil. This instruction is taken to signify that a [[courtesan]] who has accepted a suitor, had to use a veil in public similar to married women.&lt;ref&gt;Govind Sadashiv Ghurye (1951) "Indian Costume.", p.236&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the play when Vasanthasena is legally wedded, she receives the title "''Vadhūśabda''" meaning "''title of a bride''" simultaneously with the veil "''vasantasenām avagunthya''" meaning "''a token of honorable marriage''".&lt;ref&gt;Laurie Patton (1961) "Jewels of Authority: Women and Textual Tradition in Hindu India.", p.81&lt;/ref&gt; In the same literature, courtesans' maid servant Madanika marries her lover Sarvilaka, a thief who changes his ways. Her new husband says to her that she has achieved what is difficult to acquire: "''Vadhūśabda avagunthanam''" meaning "''the title and veil of a bride''".&lt;ref&gt;Laurie Patton (1961) "Jewels of Authority: Women and Textual Tradition in Hindu India.", p.81&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the ''Pratimānātaka'', a play by [[Bhāsa]] (3 - 4 CE) describes in context of the ''Avagunthana'' cloak-veil that "''ladies may be seen without any blame [for the parties concerned] in a religious session, in marriage festivities, during a calamity and in a forest''".&lt;ref&gt;Govind Sadashiv Ghurye (1951) "Indian Costume.", p.236&lt;/ref&gt; The same sentiment is more generically expressed in ''[[Nagananda|Nāgānanda]]'' and ''[[Priyadarsika|Priyadarśikā]]'' by [[Harsha]], where maidens were expected to wear no veil; it was donned only after the marriage.&lt;ref&gt;Anant Sadashiv Altekar (1959) "The Position of Women in Hindu Civilization, p.170&lt;/ref&gt; Later, the veil was referred to by the same term, ''avagunthana'', in ''[[Shishupala Vadha|Śiśupālavadha]]'' and the ''[[Dashakumaracharita]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Sulochana Ayyar (1987) "Costumes and Ornaments as Depicted in the Sculptures of Gwalior Museum.", p.152&lt;/ref&gt;  According to commentator Sankara, the ladies of [[Thanesar|Sthanvisvara]] used to go about covering their faces with a veil.&lt;ref&gt;Govind Sadashiv Ghurye (1951) "Indian Costume.", p.239&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:हिन्दू विवाह सम्प्रदाय 5 - जयपुर, भारत.JPG|thumb|Bride in ghoonghat during ''Muh Dikhai'' ceremony, Rajasthan, India.]] 

In Buddhist [[Mahayana]] literature, [[Lalitavistara Sūtra]] written in the 3rd century CE, young bride [[Yasodharā]] objected to observe veiling (oguntheti/oguṇthikā) in front of respected elders.  This was taken to be a sign of immodesty and willfulness, as people criticized her and gossiped.&lt;ref&gt;Betty Kelen 1967 "Gautama Buddha: In Life and Legend" chapter 1, pp. 7 and 8&lt;/ref&gt;  When she became aware of this, Yasodharā came before the assembled court and defended herself in a long statement: "Those whose thoughts have no cover, no shame or decorum or any virtue, those who gossip, may cover themselves with a thousand garments, yet they walk the earth naked. But those who veil their minds, control their senses, and have no thought for any other except their husband, why should they veil their faces?" Yasodharā's parents-in-law were delighted with their daughter-in-law's proud statement and gave her two white garments covered with jewels.&lt;ref&gt;Betty Kelen 1967 "Gautama Buddha: In Life and Legend" chapter 1, pp. 7 and 8&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[Lalitavistara Sūtra]] reflects changing times around the 3rd century CE and Buddhists' attempt to counter this growing practice, as there is no mention of this entire incident in early Buddhist [[Theravada Buddhism|Theravada]] literature.&lt;ref&gt;Betty Kelen 1967 "Gautama Buddha: In Life and Legend" chapter 1, pp. 7 and 8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rohini Chowdhury 2011 "Gautama Buddha: The Lord of Wisdom" chapter 1, page 9.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In ''[[Shakuntala (play)|Abhijñānaśākuntalam]]'' by [[Kālidāsa]], written between the 3rd and 4th century CE, when the heroine arrives at King [[Dushyanta#King_Dushyant|Duhsanta]]'s palace, seeking to take up her wifely status, the king first remarks "''Kā svid avagunthanavati''" meaning "''who is this veiled one?''" and immediately forbears to look at her, with the words "Anirvarnaniyam parakalatram" meaning "''The wife of another is not to be inspected.''"&lt;ref&gt;Laurie Patton (1961) "Jewels of Authority: Women and Textual Tradition in Hindu India.", p.81&lt;/ref&gt; This largely indicates that ''Avagunthana'' was a sign of a respectable married woman, and was a married woman's raiment.&lt;ref&gt;Laurie Patton (1961) "Jewels of Authority: Women and Textual Tradition in Hindu India.", p.81&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medieval period===
In ''[[Kathasaritsagara|Kathāsaritsāgara]]'' written in the 11th century AD, heroine in the story ''Ratnaprabhā'' protesting: "''I consider that the strict seclusion of women is a folly produced by jealousy. It is of no use whatsoever. Women of good character are guarded only by their own virtue and nothing else.''"&lt;ref&gt;Anant Sadashiv Altekar (1959) "The Position of Women in Hindu Civilization.", p.173&lt;/ref&gt; Rational opposition against veiling and seclusion from spirited ladies resulted in the system not becoming popular for several centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Anant Sadashiv Altekar (1959) "The Position of Women in Hindu Civilization.", p.171&lt;/ref&gt;  However, it is notable that some section of society from the 1st century B.C. advocated the use of the veil for married women. There is no proof that a large section of society observed ''strict'' veiling until the [[medieval]] period.&lt;ref&gt;Anant Sadashiv Altekar (1959) "The Position of Women in Hindu Civilization.", p.174&lt;/ref&gt; 

Under the [[Islamic]] [[Mughal Empire]], various aspects of veiling and seclusion of women was adopted, such as the concept of [[Purdah]] and [[Zenana]], partly as an additional protection for women.&lt;ref&gt;Anant Sadashiv Altekar (1959) "The Position of Women in Hindu Civilization.", p.175&lt;/ref&gt; [[Purdah]] became common in the 15th and 16th century, as both ''Vidyāpati'' and ''Chaitanya'' mention it.&lt;ref&gt;Anant Sadashiv Altekar (1959) "The Position of Women in Hindu Civilization.", p.175&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sikhism]] was highly critical of [[purdah]]; [[Guru Amar Das]] condemned it and rejected seclusion and veiling of women, which saw decline of [[purdah]] among most classes during this period.

[[File:हिन्दू विवाह सम्प्रदाय - जयपुर, भारत.jpg|thumb|Bride with full veiling during wedding ceremony]]

===Significance===
In ghoonghat practice, facial veiling observed by married women is known as ''Laaj'' ([[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]]: लज्जा, Lajja - ''modesty'', ''honor'', ''shame''). In veiling practice, it literally means "''To keep (one's) modesty, shame and honor''".  Earliest attested word ''Laaj'' in context of veiling is found in [[Valmiki]]'s ''Ramayana'' as ''lajjaavaguNThanaan'' describing Mandodari.&lt;ref name="Valmiki Ramanaya, chapter 111"&gt; Valmiki Ramanaya, chapter 111 - stanza 6-111-63 and 6-111-64&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is unclear whether it refers to facial veiling.&lt;ref&gt;Anjani Kant (1951) "Women and the Law.", p.43&lt;/ref&gt;

During a marriage ceremony, the bride wears a veil given by her parents. Later, during the ceremony the bride's mother-in-law covers her face with ghoonghat; she therefore simultaneously wears the veil given by her parents and that from her in-laws, symbolizing her passing from the protection of one's household to another.&lt;ref&gt;Emma Tarlo 1996 "Clothing Matters: Dress and Identity in India", p.177&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Hindu_wedding|Muh Dikhai]] ([[Devanagari script|Devanagari]]: मूह दिखाई, first gaze) is a post-wedding ceremony, where the bride is formally introduced to the groom's relatives and extended family. The ceremony takes place once the bride arrives in her new home; each family member lifts her veil, looks at the bride and gives her a welcoming gift. She receives ''Shagun'' from her mother-in-law, which is typically jewelry, clothing and silverware. After this ceremony the bride observes full veiling for the next few months or until her parents-in-law advise her to unveil.&lt;ref&gt;Doranne Jacobson, Susan Snow Wadley 1999 "Women in India: two perspectives", p.195&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-1900s===
During the early 1900s, women of royal and aristocratic class were first to abandon strict veiling in public. However, the head was loosely veiled due to sensitivity towards the custom during changing times.&lt;ref&gt;Laurie Patton (2004) "Maharanis: The Lives and Times of Three Generations of Indian Princesses.", p.81&lt;/ref&gt; The other classes soon followed; it lingered on in some parts of India until well after the 1940s. Facial veiling has gradually declined, and is mostly limited to parts of Hindi-speaking areas today.&lt;ref&gt;Raj Mohini Sethi (2011) "Socio-economic Profile of Rural India (series II).", p.111&lt;/ref&gt; In ghungat, a woman will veil her face from all men to whom she's related by marriage and who are senior to her husband. This would include, for example, her husband's father, elder brother and uncles. The effect of ghungat is to limit a young woman's interaction with older men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Guindi|first=Fadwa El|title=Veil: modesty, privacy and resistance|year=2003|publisher=Berg|location=Oxford [u.a.]|isbn=1859739296|pages=109-111|edition=Repr.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nevile|first=Pran|title=Lahore: a sentimental journey|year=2006|publisher=Penguin Books|location=New Delhi, India|isbn=0143061976|pages=77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, the India Human Development Survey (IHDS) found that 55% of women in India practice some form of ghoonghat, majority of them in Hindi-speaking states.&lt;ref&gt;IHDS 2004–5 data "Gender and Family Dynamics.", p.153&lt;/ref&gt; The survey found that some women may cover their face fully but for others, partial covering of the face is more a nod to propriety than a large impediment.&lt;ref&gt;IHDS 2004–5 data "Gender and Family Dynamics.", p.153&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Bahá'í sidebar}}

'''Green Acre Bahá'í School''' is one of three leading institutions owned by the [[Bahá'í Faith in the United States|National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá'ís of the United States]]. The name of the site has had various versions of "Green Acre" since before its founding in 1894 by Sarah Farmer and is a conference facility in [[Eliot, Maine]], in the [[United States]]. It had a prolonged process of progress and challenge while run by Farmer until about 1913 when she was indisposed after converting to the [[Bahá'í Faith]] in 1900. [[`Abdu'l-Bahá]], then head of the religion, visited there during his travels in the West in 1912. Farmer died in 1916 and thereafter it had evolved into the quintessential [[Bahá'í school]] directly inspiring [[Louhelen Bahá'í School]] and [[Bosch Bahá'í School]], the other two of the three schools owned by the national assembly, and today serves as a leading institution of the religion in America. It hosted diverse programs of study, presenters, and been a focus for dealing with [[racism in the United States]] through being a significant venue for [[Race Amity Convention]]s (later renamed Race Unity Day meetings) and less than a century later the [[Black Men's Gathering]]s and further events.

==Origin==
The [[Piscataqua River]] by which Green Acre Bahá'í school stands was named from [[Abenaki]] Native Americans of the [[Wabanaki Confederacy]] describing where a river separates into several parts - "a place where boats and canoes ascending the river together from its mouth were compelled to separate according to their several destinations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

A few facts are detailed - Farmer had met `Abdu'l-Bahá and accepted the religion on one occasion, and on another wanted to ask him a series of questions in the context of a review of her whole life - but when she wrote it all down she left the notebook in the hurry of being called to come to him in the early morning.

Schmidt featured Farmer and Greenacre in a chapter "Freedom and Self-Surrender" of a book ''Restless Souls: The Making of American Spirituality'' published by the University of California Press in 2012: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;The struggle at the heart of liberal spirituality ... was over the firmness and fragility of religious identity in the modern world. ... Was the point precisely the ''freedom'' of spiritual seeking? Or was the real point to find a well-marked path and to submit to the disciplines of a new religious authority in order to submerge the self in a larger relationship to God and community? ... Farmer's eventual acceptance of the Baha'i faith or "the Persian Revelation" ... discomfited her liberal, universalistic friends, many of whom preferred ongoing inquiry to actually finding one path to follow. For Farmer, the vision that she found in the Baha'i faith of a new age of religious unity, racial reconciliation, gender equality, and global peace was the fulfillment of Transcendentalism's reform impulses and progressivism's millennial dreams. To her skeptical associates, her turn to the Persian Revelation represented a betrayal of their deepest ideals as free-ranging seekers whose vision of a cosmopolitan piety dimmed at the prospect of one movement serving as a singular focus for the universal religion.&lt;ref name=Schmidt/&gt;&lt;small&gt;{{rp|pp.184–6}}&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Nevertheless, Farmer focused the efforts of the institution on Bahá'í themes. In her words in 1902:

&lt;blockquote&gt;My joy in the Persian Revelation is not that it reveals one of the streams flowing to the great Ocean of Life, Light and Love, but that it is a perfect mirror of that Ocean. What, in Green Acre, was a ''vision'' and a ''hope'' becomes, through it a ''blessed reality'' now. It has illuminated for me every other expression of Truth which I had hitherto known and place my feet on a Rock from which they cannot be moved. And it is the Manifestation of the Fatherhood - Behá'u'lláh (ed - as it was spelled in those days) - who had taught me to look away from even the Greatest and find within the One 'Powerful, Mighty, and Supreme' who is to be the Redeemer of my life. It is a Revelation of Unity such as I had never before found. By means of its Light, as shown the life of the Master Abbas Abdul Beha, I have entered into a joy greater than any I have hitherto known. Green Acre was established as a means to that end and in proportion as well lay aside all spirit of criticism of others and seek only to live the Unity we find, shall we be able to help others to the same divine realization.&lt;ref name=Schmidt/&gt;{{rp|p.206}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

There followed a few more talks and farewell visits on topics like elimination of prejudice. He was said to characterize the work as "like that of the exhausted iron worker's apprentice whose master said to him 'Die, but pump.'&lt;ref name=Perry2012/&gt;{{rp|p.81}}

`Abdu'l-Bahá again visited Farmer and they went on a car tour including a stop to view the shipyard where the treaty had been signed.&lt;ref name=Perry2012/&gt;{{rp|p.72}} On the return trip she was not allowed to step off the car when it stopped at Green Acre.&lt;ref name=Menon1/&gt;

On the last day at Green Acre he met with individuals and then left stopping at Farmer's hospitalization again this time by carriage - she wept at his feet on that occasion.&lt;ref name=Schmidt/&gt;&lt;small&gt;{{rp|pp.211–5}}&lt;/small&gt;&lt;ref name=Perry2012/&gt;{{rp|p.81}}

'''Half-widow''' is a term given to [[Kashmiri people|Kashmiri]] women whose husbands have [[Forced disappearance|disappeared]] and were still missing during the [[Kashmir conflict|ongoing conflict]] in [[Kashmir]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/the-other-half/|title=The other half: For many Kashmir ‘half-widows’, the remarriage ruling means little|date=2 March 2014|work=The Indian Express}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These women are called "half-widows" because they have no idea whether their husbands are dead or alive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-24530201|title=In pictures: Kashmir's 'half-widows'|work=BBC World News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thousands of husbands in Kashmir disappeared during the conflict. .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/asia/2013/09/dilemma-kashmir-half-widows-201392715575877378.html|title=The dilemma of Kashmir's half-widows}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the half-widows have not remarried due to doubt about their husband's fate and a lack of consensus among [[Muslim scholars]] on the issue. In Kashmir, a group of religious scholars issued a [[fatwa]] on the 26 of December 2013 saying that half-widows are allowed to remarry after a waiting period of four years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ummahhelpline.com/qa/291.php|title=Issue of remarrying of kashmari HALF-WIDOWS?  -UmmahHelpline|work=ummahhelpline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Hellblazer''''' (also known as '''''John Constantine, Hellblazer''''') is an American contemporary [[Horror fiction|horror]] [[comic book]] series, originally published by [[DC Comics]], and subsequently by the [[Vertigo Comics|Vertigo]] imprint since March 1993 when the imprint was introduced. Its central character is the streetwise magician [[John Constantine]], who was created by [[Alan Moore]] and [[Stephen R. Bissette]], and first appeared as a supporting character in ''[[Swamp Thing]]'' (vol. 2) #37 (June 1985), during that creative team's run on that title. ''Hellblazer'' had been published continuously since January [[1988 in comics|1988]], and was Vertigo's longest running title, the only remaining publication from the imprint's launch.&lt;ref name="vert-ency"&gt;{{Cite book | last = Irvine | first = Alex | author-link = Alexander C.

Well known for its political and [[social commentary]], the series has spawned a film adaptation, television show, novels, and multiple spin-offs and crossovers.

The series was the longest-running and one of the most successful titles of DC's Vertigo imprint, and was the stepping stone for many British writers. Notable writers who have contributed to the series include [[Jamie Delano]], [[Garth Ennis]], [[Eddie Campbell]], [[Paul Jenkins (writer)|Paul Jenkins]], [[Warren Ellis]], [[Grant Morrison]], [[Neil Gaiman]], [[Brian Azzarello]], [[Darko Macan]], [[Mike Carey (writer)|Mike Carey]], [[Andy Diggle]],[[Robert Venditti]], [[Peter Milligan]], [[Jeff Lemire]], Ray Fawke, Ming Doyle, [[James Tynion IV]], [[Simon Oliver]], [[Tim Seeley]], [[Ian Rankin]] and [[Si Spencer]] . ''Hellblazer'' was one of the first modern [[occult detective fiction]] works and heavily influenced the genre to come.

==Production history==
After favorable reader reaction to [[John Constantine]]'s appearances in the comic book series ''[[Swamp Thing]]'', where he had been introduced by [[Alan Moore]] during his authorship of the title, the character was given his own comic book series in 1988.&lt;ref name=STH_character&gt;{{cite web| last = McMahon| first = John| title = John Constantine: Who Is He?| url = http://www.insanerantings.com/hell/constantine/index.html| accessdate = 2007-05-31| deadurl = no| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070613153633/http://www.insanerantings.com/hell/constantine/index.html| archivedate = 2007-06-13| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tabularasa&gt;{{cite web| last = Carroll| first = David| title = Trail Blazers: Interviews with Jamie Delano and Garth Ennis| url = http://www.tabula-rasa.info/AusComics/Hellblazers.html| accessdate = 2007-05-30| deadurl = no| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070625163337/http://www.tabula-rasa.info/AusComics/Hellblazers.html| archivedate = 2007-06-25| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The series was intended to bear the title ''Hellraiser'', but this title was revised before publication due to the contemporaneous release of [[Clive Barker]]'s unrelated [[Hellraiser|film of the same name]].&lt;ref name=STH_FAQ&gt;{{cite web| last = McMahon| first = John| title = Straight to Hell: A Hellblazer Site – FAQ| url = http://www.insanerantings.com/hell/faq/index.html#mq2| accessdate = 2007-05-30| deadurl = no| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070624092658/http://www.insanerantings.com/hell/faq/index.html#mq2| archivedate = 2007-06-24| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Initial writer Jamie Delano was, in his own words, "fairly ambivalent" about the change of title.&lt;ref name=legends&gt;{{cite web|url=http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2012/10/26/comic-book-legends-revealed-390/|title=Comic Book Legends Revealed #390|author=Brian Cronin|publisher=Comic Book Resources|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151017023209/http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2012/10/26/comic-book-legends-revealed-390/|archivedate=2015-10-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The initial creative team was writer [[Jamie Delano]] and artist [[John Ridgway (comic artist)|John Ridgway]], with [[Dave McKean]] supplying distinctive painted and [[collage]] covers. Delano introduced a political aspect to the character, about which he stated: "...generally I was interested in commenting on 1980s Britain. That was where I was living, it was shit, and I wanted to tell everybody."&lt;ref name="tabularasa"/&gt; The book, originally published as a regular [[DC Comics]] title, became a [[Vertigo Comics|Vertigo]] title with the imprint's launch in March 1993 (issue #63 of the series). In October 2011, it was announced that this would join DC titles in being published digitally on the same day as its physical release, starting in January 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vertigo.blog.dccomics.com/2011/10/14/vertigo-to-publish-several-comic-book-series-same-day-digital/|title=vertigo to publish several comic book series same day digital.|publisher=Vertigo|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111017162542/http://vertigo.blog.dccomics.com/2011/10/14/vertigo-to-publish-several-comic-book-series-same-day-digital/|archivedate=2011-10-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many writers had lengthy runs on the series, such as [[Garth Ennis]] and [[Mike Carey (British writer)|Mike Carey]], who respectively had the second- and third-longest runs on the book, (only behind [[Peter Milligan]]). Other writers who wrote for the series include [[Paul Jenkins (writer)|Paul Jenkins]], [[Warren Ellis]], [[Brian Azzarello]], [[Neil Gaiman]], [[Grant Morrison]], [[Denise Mina]], and [[Andy Diggle]].&lt;ref name="vert-ency"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pop"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://popculture-y.com/2014/03/beginners-guide-john-constantine-or-hellblazer/ |title=A Beginner’s Guide to: John Constantine, Or, Hellblazer |author=Allison O'Toole |publisher=''Pop Culture-Y'' |date=March 7, 2014 |accessdate=October 14, 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141024103859/http://popculture-y.com/2014/03/beginners-guide-john-constantine-or-hellblazer/ |archivedate=October 24, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Setting and protagonist===
{{see also|John Constantine|List of Hellblazer characters}}

''Hellblazer'' was set in a contemporary world, albeit a world of [[magic (paranormal)|magic]] and [[supernatural]] conflict behind the scenes.&lt;ref name="God#1"/&gt; Although the official setting of the series was the [[DC Universe]], well-known DC characters were rarely seen or mentioned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shedeen|first1=Jesse|title=Between the Panels: DC Needs to Take Vertigo Back to its Roots|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/04/22/between-the-panels-dc-needs-to-take-vertigo-back-to-its-roots|website=IGN|accessdate=30 November 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171202051949/http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/04/22/between-the-panels-dc-needs-to-take-vertigo-back-to-its-roots|archivedate=2 December 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some DC Comics characters—most notably the fringe supernatural characters such as [[Zatanna]], the [[Phantom Stranger]], [[Shade, the Changing Man]], [[Dream (comics)|Dream of the Endless]], and the [[Swamp Thing]] made appearances.

John Constantine, the main character of ''Hellblazer'', was portrayed as a kind of [[Confidence trick|confidence man]] and [[occult detective]] who did morally questionable things, arguably for the greater good.&lt;ref name="Pop"/&gt; He usually triumphed through guile, deceit, and misdirection, but often made more enemies in the process than he defeated. Indeed, it was a common theme in the book that Constantine was unable to effect any lasting change or enjoy unequivocal victories. While sometimes striving for the good of mankind, Constantine was often [[Psychological manipulation|manipulative]] and a dangerous person to have as a friend, as the lives and souls of those around him became perilously involved in his misadventures. He took pains to protect himself from direct attacks, but his friends and relatives were often endangered in order to strike at him. The spirits of deceased friends haunted him, individually or as an entourage of [[ghost]]s.&lt;ref name="vert-ency"/&gt;

Constantine made appearances in other comic book titles, such as ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'', ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'', ''[[Green Arrow]]'', ''[[Green Lantern]]'', ''[[The Sandman (Vertigo)|The Sandman]]'', ''[[Lucifer (DC Comics)|Lucifer]]'', and ''[[Shade, the Changing Man]]''. He was a recurring supporting character in both ''[[Swamp Thing]]'' and ''[[The Books of Magic]]'' throughout their numerous incarnations. Some attempts to use the character in other superhero or family-friendly comics were altered due to editorial mandate, such as "Gregori Eilovotich Rasputin" in ''[[Firestorm (comics)|Firestorm]]'' and ''[[Captain Atom]]'' (who refers to Constantine as "an impertinent bumbler in England"). Grant Morrison created "Willoughby Kipling" for ''[[Doom Patrol]]'' after being refused Constantine by DC, changing his appearance to that of [[Richard E. Grant]] in ''[[Withnail and I]]'', following which [[Phil Foglio]] was forced to create "Ambroise Bierce" in ''[[Stanley and His Monster]]'', having been refused both Constantine ''and'' Willoughby Kipling.&lt;ref name=legends /&gt;

John Constantine was reintroduced into the DC Universe in 2011, initially in the ''[[Brightest Day]]'' [[crossover event]] title ''Search for the Swamp Thing'', and in the ongoing [[The New 52]] title ''[[Justice League Dark]]''.&lt;ref name=JLD&gt;{{cite web|title=Justice League Dark interview with Peter Milligan|url=http://www.newsarama.com/comics/dcnu-peter-milligan-justice-league-dark-110609.html|publisher=Newsarama|date=9 June 2011|author=Vaneta Rogers|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921114112/http://www.newsarama.com/7775-milligan-dcnu-justice-league-spin-off-emotionally-dark.html|archivedate=21 September 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1988–1991: Jamie Delano (#1–40, #84)===
[[File:Hellblazercover.jpg|thumb|left|Jamie Delano would often put his own political views in the comic. Seen here in the cover of ''Hellblazer'' #3 by [[Dave McKean]]. The artwork depicts [[John Constantine]] passing by a vandalized image of [[Margaret Thatcher]] and a sign that says, “Voting Tory can damage your health” that points to the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative party]], both of which is the cause of [[London]] burning in the background.&lt;ref name="God#1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Vulture"/&gt;]]
Having previously worked on ''[[D.R. &amp; Quinch]]'' for ''[[2000 AD (comics)|2000 AD]]'', a title made popular by John Constantine's creator Alan Moore, Delano was selected to start the character's first run in his own comic by then editor [[Karen Berger]] in [[1988 in comics|1988]]. Delano's run was characterised by his political satire, taking on late 1980s and 1990s tropes such as with city financiers being literal demons, and Constantine meeting with [[Freemasons]] from the [[Houses of Parliament]]. He also had [[environmentalism|environmentalist]] issues crop up, especially in "The Fear Machine" (issues #15–22), where John fell in with a travelling community of environmental activists. Indeed, editor [[Karen Berger]] noted on Delano's departure the irony that his final issue was handed in the week that [[Margaret Thatcher]] was forced out of office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Hellblazer #40|page=38|publisher=[[DC Comics]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were five main storylines in the run. The first, collected as "Original Sins",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Original Sins|publisher=Vertigo|date=October 1998|ISBN=1-56389-052-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; deals with John travelling to America to exorcise a demon, [[Mnemoth]], and investigate a strange cult known as Damnation's Army, crossing paths with a demon called [[List of Characters in Hellblazer#Nergal|Nergal]] (from whom he gains demon blood), and having to be responsible for killing an old friend, [[List of Characters in Hellblazer#The Ghosts|Gary Lester]], and betraying another, called [[List of Characters in Hellblazer#Mary 'Zed' Martin|Zed]], in the process. The following four issues, "The Devil You Know"&lt;ref name="Rare Cuts"&gt;{{cite book|title=Rare Cuts|publisher=Vertigo|date=May 2007|ISBN= 1-4012-1269-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; finally explain John's failure to save a young girl, [[List of Characters in Hellblazer#The Ghosts|Astra]], from a demon in [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]], an event that left him near insane and incarcerated in an asylum known as Ravenscar, and still haunted him to the comic's end. He eventually discovers that the demon responsible for this was Nergal, and uses a technological scheme to trap him, and lead him back to hell. It also contains a crossover with ''Swamp Thing'', where Constantine loses his body while the Swamp Thing uses it to procreate.

This was followed by a lengthy nine-issue story arc, "The Fear Machine",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Fear Machine|publisher=Vertigo|date=June 2008|ISBN=1-4012-1810-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; revolving around a masonic plot to collect people's fears, in order to resurrect a [[Cthulhu Mythos|Cthulhian]] god known as Juntakillokian, and his efforts to prevent this with the help of environmentalists, including [[List of characters in Hellblazer#Other Supporting Characters|Mercury]], a young psychic girl, and [[List of characters in Hellblazer#Other Supporting Characters|Marj]], her mother, with whom he becomes romantically involved. The penultimate major run of Delano's tenure was "[[List of characters in Hellblazer#The Family Man|The Family Man]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Family Man|publisher=Titan Books|date=November 2008|ISBN= 1-84576-978-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; which differed from the main body of the series thus far in that Constantine's nemesis is not supernatural (beyond an opening [[metafiction]]al encounter with a fictional [[Fence (criminal)|fence]]), but a former policeman turned serial killer. John's ethical quandary as to whether murder is ever acceptable, and his coping with the murder of his father, [[List of Characters in Hellblazer#The Ghosts|Thomas]], frames this story. During this run on the title, [[Grant Morrison]] (issues #25 &amp; 26) and [[Neil Gaiman]] (issue #27) both filled in during a three-month break, Grant Morrison's story dealing with nuclear fear, and Neil Gaiman's being a simple romantic ghost story.

Delano's run ended with "[[List of Characters in Hellblazer#The Golden Child|The Golden Child]]", where John is reunited with Marj and Mercury, who help him discover that he murdered his more perfect twin in the womb, culminating in an extended story, in which we are shown what would have occurred had the other twin survived in his place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Hellblazer #40|publisher=DC Comics}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his run, there was also a stand-alone issue, ''Hellblazer Annual'' #1, exploring Constantine's ancestry, and featuring the video to John's punk band, Mucous Membrane's song [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV6Sl_u1s3M "Venus of the Hardsell"].

Jamie Delano returned to the title on several occasions. Between the Garth Ennis and Paul Jenkins runs on ''Hellblazer'', he finally told the story of why John's best friend Chas 'owes' him, and he returned again for one of the five Christmas stories in issue #250. He also wrote the miniseries ''[[The Horrorist (comics)|The Horrorist]]'' in 1995, and ''[[Hellblazer Special: Bad Blood|Bad Blood]]'' in 2000, both featuring John Constantine. A more substantial return was made in 2010 for a hardcover graphic novel ''[[Hellblazer: Pandemonium]]'' with artist [[Jock (artist)|Jock]] to commemorate the 25th anniversary of John Constantine's first appearance in ''Swamp Thing''.&lt;ref name=cbr10971&gt;{{cite web |first=Emmett |last=Furey |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=10971 |title=Back into Hell: Jamie Delano returns to John Constantine's world |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] |date=July 27, 2007 |accessdate=July 28, 2007 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080508045734/http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=10971 |archivedate=May 8, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1991–1999: Garth Ennis (#41–83, #129–133) and Paul Jenkins (#89–128)===
[[File:FirstoftheFallen.jpg|thumb|right|The First of the Fallen, a principal antagonist in Garth Ennis' run on Hellblazer, as drawn by William Simpson]]

Irish writer [[Garth Ennis]] then took over the title in [[1991 in comics|1991]], again from ''2000 AD'', where he had been working on ''[[Judge Dredd]]''. He proceeded to write the longest run for any writer on the title.&lt;ref name="vert-hell"/&gt; His take on the title was more personal than Jamie Delano's, with John's relationships coming to the fore. It also had a strong religious theme, with John's dealings with the [[First of the Fallen]], and some storylines, such as the relationship between an angel, Tali, and a [[succubus]] demon, [[Chantinelle|Ellie]], would go on to be used again as a major plot device in ''[[Preacher (comic)|Preacher]]'', one of his most popular works. He also references the music of [[The Pogues]] and the poetry of [[Brendan Behan]], both of these being relevant to Ennis' Irish heritage.

His run started with "[[Dangerous Habits]]" (41–46),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Dangerous Habits|publisher=Vertigo|author=Garth Ennis|isbn=1-56389-150-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was the basis for the 2005 film ''[[Constantine (film)|Constantine]]'', and dealt with John Constantine contracting [[lung cancer]], and the desperate deal he makes with the First of the Fallen, and various other lords of Hell, to save himself. In the course of trying to save himself, he visits Ireland, where he becomes reacquainted with [[Heartland (comics)|Kit Ryan]], an old friend. The following few issues follow the early stages of his relationship with Kit, a plot to install a demon on the British throne in the plotline "Royal Blood", and in the extended issue #50, his first meeting with the [[Count Dracula|King of the Vampires]]. One minor story in this arc (issue #51) was written by guest writer [[John Smith (comics writer)|John Smith]].&lt;ref name="Rare Cuts"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Bloodlines|author=Garth Ennis|publisher=Vertigo|ISBN=1-40121-514-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The next major arc, "Fear and Loathing" (issues 62-67) covers a high point of John's personal life, with his relationship with Kit going well, and a fortieth birthday party where his friends Ellie, [[Zatanna]], and the Swamp Thing attend, and use their various abilities to create a large quantity of [[Old Bushmills Distillery|Bushmills]] whiskey and [[marijuana]]. The story then takes him to his lowest point, through his dealings with the [[National Front (United Kingdom)|National Front]], their threats towards Kit, and her leaving him to return to Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Fear and Loathing|author=Garth Ennis| ISBN=1-56389-202-2|publisher=Vertigo}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following this, John is defeated, and lives homeless on the streets, drinking to forget his life. This remains the case until the King of the Vampires hunts him out, and is poisoned by his demon blood, leaving him out in the sun at dawn, killing him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Tainted Love|author=Garth Ennis|ISBN=1-56389-456-4|publisher=Vertigo}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following his recovery, the storyline "Damnation's Flame" (Issues #72–77) follows a trip to the US, where Constantine is put into an alternative America by his old adversary [[List of Characters in Hellblazer#Papa Midnite|Papa Midnite]], a [[Haitian Vodou|Vodun shaman]]. He is accompanied by the spirit of [[John F. Kennedy|JFK]], who has to hold his brain in place from his [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|infamous wound]]. He eventually learns how to escape, shortly before running into the First of the Fallen, in the guise of [[Abraham Lincoln]]. There then follows a small break where he meets the spirit of a dead friend in Dublin, offering some closure to his recent problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Damnation's Flame|author=Garth Ennis|ISBN=1-56389-508-0|publisher=Vertigo}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ennis' run ends with "Rake at the Gates of Hell", a story which finally brings together the racism storyline, with riots in [[Mile End]], echoing the real-life [[Brixton Riots (disambiguation)|Brixton]] and [[Broadwater Farm riot|Broadwater Farm]] riots in London, the revenge attempt of the First of the Fallen, started in "Dangerous Habits", and the end of John's relationship with Kit Ryan. John's eventual Pyrrhic victory leaves this run with closure, and a relatively clean slate for a new writer to take over.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Rake at the Gates of Hell|author=Garth Ennis|ISBN=1-4012-0002-8|publisher=Vertigo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following a brief interlude by ''[[From Hell]]'' artist [[Eddie Campbell]], the series' direction was taken over by [[Paul Jenkins (writer)|Paul Jenkins]] in [[1995 in comics|1995]]. He had been the former editor of ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]'' and other [[Mirage Studios]] lines.&lt;ref name="CBR Marvel PR"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/news/newsitem.cgi?id=6258|title=Paul Jenkins Signs Exclusive to Marvel|accessdate=28 February 2008|publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]]|year=2005|author=Jonah Weiland|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6AZP83yhK?url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article|archivedate=10 September 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had pitched to several comic houses, having tired of editing, and eventually managed to gain stewardship of ''Hellblazer'', the first largely untested writer to achieve this.&lt;ref name="CBDB Bio"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://comicbookdb.com/creator.php?ID=157|title=Comic Book DB – Paul Jenkins|accessdate=28 February 2008|publisher=ComicBookDB.com|year=2005|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6AZP9CNtP?url=http://comicbookdb.com/creator.php?ID=157|archivedate=10 September 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jenkins' run is more traditionally English in its themes, with [[Albion]], [[King Arthur|Arthurian legend]], and old English battles all featuring, and even an appearance by [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]], and a speculative explanation of the writing of [[Kubla Khan]], and what the interruption of the '[[Person from Porlock|man from Porlock]]' may have been. He also returns to Jamie Delano's coverage of [[Anarchism|anarchist]] lifestyles, and the effects of the [[Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994|Criminal Justice Act of 1994]], a controversial law which restricted the ability of the public to throw [[rave]]s and large demonstrations.&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert J. (1999)''Discographies: Dance Music, Culture, and the Politics of Sound'', Page 150, Routledge {{ISBN|0-415-17032-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Meaden, B. (2006) ''TRANCENational ALIENation'' Page 19, Lulu, {{ISBN|1-4116-8543-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Major storylines in this run include "Critical Mass", where Constantine is forced to use magic to purge his darker side into another human body, in order to avoid being damned to Hell as part of a trade to save the possessed son of a friend, thus creating the antagonistic character, [[List of characters in Hellblazer#The Demon Constantine|Demon Constantine]], with the assistance of [[Aleister Crowley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Hellblazer issues #93–97|publisher=Vertigo|author=Paul Jenkins}}&lt;/ref&gt; The landmark hundredth issue gave more detail on John Constantine's father, and the abusive relationship that they had shared. However, it is unclear as to whether this is happening in reality, or in his mind as John convalesces in a coma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Hellblazer issue #100|publisher=Vertigo|author=Paul Jenkins}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Last Man Standing" reveals that his friend Rich is the current descendant of King Arthur, and [[Merlin]]'s attempt to discover God's secret, an act which would destroy England, using John's few remaining friends as bait.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Hellblazer issues #110–114|publisher=Vertigo|author=Paul Jenkins}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tenth anniversary issue breaks from the usual format, in breaking the [[Fourth Wall|fourth wall]], and addressing the reader as if they are in a pub with Constantine for a monthly get together to hear his stories. Over the course of the issue, most of the characters from Constantine's history appear, along with [[Death (DC Comics)|Death of the Endless]] from ''[[The Sandman (Vertigo)|Sandman]]''. There are also appearances by writers and artists, including series creator Alan Moore, Garth Ennis, and Jenkins himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Hellblazer issue 120|publisher=Vertigo|author=Paul Jenkins}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jenkins' run then draws to a close with two storylines, "Up the Down Staircase" and "How to Play With Fire", which relate the First of the Fallen's new plan, to essentially let mankind ruin itself through television and consumerism, and Ellie's plot to leave Constantine friendless and alone. John eventually saves himself, through a literal [[Deus Ex Machina|deus ex machina]], in a campfire conversation with [[Presence (DC Comics)|God]].&lt;ref name="God#1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/10/20/comics-history-101-constantine|title=''Comics History 101: Constantine''|publisher=[[IGN]]|author=Scott Collura|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141219144939/http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/10/20/comics-history-101-constantine|archivedate=2014-12-19|df=}} October 20, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.insanerantings.com/hell/comics/ongoing/hb128.html Straight to Hell: A Hellblazer Site: Sifting Through The Ashes (HTPWF: Part Four)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304235952/http://www.insanerantings.com/hell/comics/ongoing/hb128.html |date=March 4, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, at that time Rich and his family finally sever their friendship with John, and the latter ends the run alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Hellblazer issues 121–128|publisher=Vertigo|author=Paul Jenkins}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paul Jenkins later returned for one of the five stories in issue #250.

Ennis briefly returned to the title in 1998 with "Son of Man", filling the gaps between Paul Jenkins's and Warren Ellis's runs on the title. This more irreverent story is about the consequences of Constantine resurrecting the dead son of an [[East End of London#Crime|East London gangster]], using the spirit of a demon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Son of Man|author=Garth Ennis|ISBN=1-4012-0202-0|publisher=Vertigo}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also had two specials published during his run on the title, the ''Hellblazer Special'' and ''Heartland'', which follows Kit Ryan's return to Ireland.

===1999–2002===

==== Warren Ellis (#134–143) ====

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Smart-Ass John.jpg|thumb|right|John Constantine as drawn by Marcelo Frusin in Warren Ellis, Brian Azzarello and Mike Carey's run.]] --&gt;

[[Warren Ellis]] took over the title in [[1999 in comics|1999]], after his work on ''[[Transmetropolitan]]'' which had moved to the Vertigo imprint, following the closure of [[Helix Comics]].&lt;ref name="vert-hell"&gt;{{Cite book | last = Irvine | first = Alex | author-link = Alexander C.

''[[International Journal of Comic Art]]''. '''7''' (2). 370–374&lt;/ref&gt; The story was finally published in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=VERTIGO RESURRECTED – Shoot #1 100-Page Spectacular|author=Warren Ellis|publisher=Vertigo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His brief run began with "Haunted", a London-based story in which John investigates the brutal murder of a former girlfriend, Isabel by an [[Aleister Crowley]] style magician, Josh Wright. The story introduces, or reintroduces many characters who became an important part of the Hellblazer universe, including Inspector Watford (originally from Jamie Delano's run on the title), aging magician Clarice, and Map, a powerful magician who works on [[London Underground|tube]] renovations in his part as custodian of London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Haunted|publisher=Vertigo|author=Warren Ellis|ISBN=1-56389-813-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The remainder of Ellis' brief tenure was taken up with single issue stories, collected as "Setting Sun".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Setting Sun|publisher=Vertigo|author=Warren Ellis|ISBN=1-4012-0245-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Brian Azzarello (#146–174)====

Following a brief interlude by Croatian writer [[Darko Macan]], the series was then taken over by [[Brian Azzarello]], once again hired on the strength of his own series for Vertigo, ''[[100 Bullets]]''. Azzarello's run is one large meta-story, that follows John Constantine on a trip across America, starting with his incarceration in prison,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Hard Time|publisher=Vertigo|author=Brian Azzarello|ISBN=1-56389-696-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; then variously uncovering a pornography ring,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Good Intentions|publisher=Vertigo|author=Brian Azzarello|ISBN=1-56389-856-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; catching a serial killer,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Freezes Over|publisher=Vertigo|author=Brian Azzarello|ISBN=1-56389-971-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; taking on a [[Neo Nazi]] group before finally dealing with the architect of his incarceration, Stanley W. Manor,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Highwater|publisher=Vertigo|author=Brian Azzarello|ISBN=1-4012-0223-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; a thinly-veiled pastiche of [[Batman]]. Brian Azzarello did return for one of the five stories in issue #250. This arc achieved minor controversy for its depiction of Constantine as in a homosexual relationship.

===2002–2006: Mike Carey (#175–215, #229)===

Following Azzarello's run, writer [[Mike Carey (writer)|Mike Carey]] took over the title, following his [[Eisner Award|Eisner award]]-winning title ''[[Lucifer (DC comics)|Lucifer]]'', set in the ''[[The Sandman (Vertigo)|Sandman]]'' universe.&lt;ref name="vert-luci"&gt;{{Citation | last = Irvine | first = Alex | author-link = Alexander C. Irvine | contribution = Lucifer | editor-last = Dougall | editor-first = Alastair | title = The Vertigo Encyclopedia | pages = 118–124 | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]] | place = New York | year = 2008 | ISBN = 0-7566-4122-5 | oclc = 213309015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carey's run attempted to return John Constantine to his roots, with the title largely set back in London, and featuring many characters from former runs on the title. Mike Carey also has the honour of being the first [[Liverpudlian]] to write the Liverpudlian character. His was the second longest run by any single author on the title, second only to Garth Ennis.&lt;ref name="vert-hell"/&gt;

The start of his run introduces Angie Spatchcock, a fellow magician, and reintroduces his niece, Gemma Constantine, who has also fallen into magic use, to her uncle's consternation. After ridding his sister's house of an evil spirit, and finding out Gemma has gone missing, John returns to London, to find his old colleagues and enemies are all taking sides in the hunt for a mythical item, known as the Red Sepulchre. John eventually locates the item, and finds Gemma, freeing her from his old enemy Josh Wright.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Red Sepulchre|publisher=Vertigo|author=Mike Carey|ISBN=1-4012-0485-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following several forewarnings, Constantine then travels the world to set up a plan for a forthcoming tragedy, which will occur when "Three doors are opened", involving [[Swamp Thing]] and the [[Garden of Eden]] amongst others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Black Flowers|publisher=Vertigo|author=Mike Carey|ISBN=1-4012-0499-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

John's preparations have no effect, however, as he is tricked into killing the guardian that had been preventing the tragedy, freeing a beast which can control the collective unconsciousness of mankind. John Constantine cuts his own wrists, in order to free himself from consciousness, and plays a confidence trick on the beast, allowing his friends time to use the collective consciousness to rebuild the guardian that had kept the beast trapped. However, in this process, Swamp Thing has his human soul removed, setting up [[Swamp Thing#Volume 4|the fourth run of the comic, relaunched shortly afterward]]. In the process John loses his memory, setting up the events leading up to the 200th issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Staring at the Wall|publisher=Vertigo|author=Mike Carey|ISBN=1-4012-0929-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leading up to the landmark issue, John has little control over events, and is led along by a psychic serial killer, who threatens to kill Chas and his family, and a demon, Rosacarnis, who offers his memories back, at the cost of 24 hours in her service. John eventually gives into this offer, and the 200th issue shows how Rosacarnis manipulates his reality, making him raise three children with her, in the guise of Kit Ryan, from Garth Ennis's time on the title, Zed, from Jamie Delano's, and Angie, from the current run,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Stations of the Cross|publisher=Vertigo|author=Mike Carey|ISBN=1-4012-1002-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; with three different artists, [[Steve Dillon]], [[Marcelo Frusin]] and [[Leonardo Manco]] each drawing one story, as the past, present and future of the title.

Carey's final run followed the attempts of John's three new children attempting to kill all of his family and friends, culminating in the death of his sister, Cheryl, at the hands of her possessed husband.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Reasons to be Cheerful|publisher=Vertigo|author=Mike Carey|ISBN=1-4012-1251-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; John then travels into Hell to try to rescue her soul, with the assistance of Rosacarnis's father, Nergal. The plan ultimately fails, and John returns broken, and intending to renounce magic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Gift|publisher=Vertigo|author=Mike Carey|ISBN=1-4012-1453-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mike Carey returned to the title for a single issue between Denise Mina and Andy Diggle's runs on the title, and also wrote the well-received&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fantasyliterature.com/reviews/hellblazer-all-his-engines/|title=''Hellblazer: All His Engines'' review|publisher=''Fantasy Literature''|author=Hawley, Brad|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140706055822/http://www.fantasyliterature.com/reviews/hellblazer-all-his-engines/|archivedate=2014-07-06|df=}} May 17, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; ''Hellblazer'' graphic novel ''[[All His Engines]]'' about a strange illness sweeping the globe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=All His Engines|publisher=Vertigo|author=Mike Carey|ISBN=1-4012-0317-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2006–2013===

==== Denise Mina (#216–228) ====

[[Denise Mina]] had not written for comics when she took over the title in [[2006 in comics|2006]], but had three acclaimed crime novels to her name, the Garnetthill trilogy, the first of which won the [[Crime Writers' Association|CWA]] [[CWA New Blood Dagger|award for best debut crime novel]]. Her run on the title took John to Scotland, to attempt to stop a plot to make everybody empathise with each other. However, John fails to stop this, and, overwhelmed by the grief and horror they're forced to empathically share, suicides abound through the people of Glasgow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Empathy is the Enemy|publisher=Vertigo|author=Denise Mina|ISBN=1-4012-1066-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; With help from Gemma Constantine, Angie Spatchcock and Chas Chandler, a plan to reverse the problem is made, as tension builds among the soldiers now surrounding the city. The soldiers keenly listen to a [[2006 FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] match between England and Portugal on the radio. When England loses the match, it seems all is lost, but the expected psychic riot fails to materialize. The soldiers are Scottish, so [[England and Scotland football rivalry|England's loss is celebrated]], saving the day, and proving there's no source of joy like [[Schadenfreude]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Red Right Hand|publisher=Vertigo|author=Denise Mina|ISBN=1-4012-1342-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Andy Diggle (#230–249) ====

[[Andy Diggle]], having previously written the ''Hellblazer'' special, ''[[Lady Constantine]]'', and Vertigo titles ''[[The Losers (comics)|The Losers]]'' and ''[[Swamp Thing]]'', took over the title in [[2007 in comics|2007]],&lt;ref name="Ref_c"&gt;[http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=88058 Andy Diggle Joins ''Hellblazer'' With #230, [[Newsarama]]] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929134934/http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=88058 |date=September 29, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; another former writer for ''2000 AD'' to have done this. He left the title in 2009 after accepting an exclusive contract with [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]].&lt;ref name="Phegley2009"&gt;{{cite web|first=Kiel |last=Phegley |url=http://www.marvel.com/news/moviestories.7311/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130103232918/http://www.marvel.com/news/moviestories.7311/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=January 3, 2013 |title=EXCLUSIVE: Diggle on Daredevil |publisher=[[Marvel.com]] |date=March 26, 2009 |accessdate=March 27, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The run starts by introducing two main antagonists, an aging politician, who is using a strange portal to enter other people's minds and commit crimes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Joyride|publisher=Vertigo|author=Andy Diggle|ISBN=1-4012-1651-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Mako, a cannibalistic mage who devours other magicians in order to obtain their power. Constantine's attempt to play them off one another only succeeds in making them join forces in a further plot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Laughing Magician|publisher=Vertigo|author=Andy Diggle|ISBN=1-4012-1853-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Constantine then traps them both with considerable ease, and questions how this has been so easy. It then becomes apparent that he has been manipulated by the 'Golden Child', his twin who did not survive childbirth, and has been manipulating events for the whole of the series, including his battle with cancer and many other events. He declines his twin's offer to merge souls, suspicious that his twin has been weakening his will in past years to make him accept this offer, choosing instead to take control of his own destiny.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Roots of Coincidence|publisher=Vertigo|author=Andy Diggle|ISBN=1-4012-2251-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Peter Milligan (#250–300) ====

[[Peter Milligan]], a veteran of the Vertigo line, having written both ''[[Shade, The Changing Man]]'' and ''[[Animal Man]]'' at the publisher's inception, then took over,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=19012 Peter Milligan Talks “Hellblazer”] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921055904/http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=19012 |date=September 21, 2013 }}, [[Comic Book Resources]], December 3, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; starting with a short story in the landmark 250th issue, and taking over full-time following this. His run implemented several major changes, including John Constantine's wedding and the loss of his thumb.

In a rare change, Milligan's run on the title starts with John living in domestic bliss with a nurse, Phoebe. Over the course of the first storyline, several new characters are introduced, including Epiphany Greaves, the alchemist daughter of a notorious London gangster, and Julian, a [[Babylonia]]n demon. Over the course of the run, John dealt with a demon taking revenge on people involved in the [[Liverpool dockers' strike]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Scab|publisher=Vertigo|author=Peter Milligan|ISBN=1-4012-2501-2}},&lt;/ref&gt; gone insane and sought help from [[Shade, The Changing Man]], after chopping off his own thumb, seen Phoebe die at the hands of Julian,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Hooked|publisher=Vertigo|author=Peter Milligan|ISBN=1-4012-2728-7}},&lt;/ref&gt; and traveled to India to try to find a way of saving her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=India|publisher=Vertigo|author=Peter Milligan|ISBN=1-4012-2848-8}},&lt;/ref&gt; Following this, he realised that he was in love with Epiphany, and married her in the 275th issue. However, the events of this wedding turned Constantine's niece Gemma against him, due to the Demon Constantine sexually assaulting her in the restroom. The strain of this traumatic incident turned her against John, and she enlisted the help of a coven of witches to kill him, which later came to a head when John was forced to fight off a brutal Demon summoned by them using John's iconic trenchcoat to target him.

Afterwards, John's coat (which Gemma sold on [[eBay]]) began to manipulate its various new owners into murder, suicide, or other horrific acts until coming into the hands of a man from the U.S., who tried to kill John and Epiphany. During the time the coat was missing, John's magical abilities had begun to go out of control. John eventually resolves this, and he was re-united with his coat. Since this, Gemma and John have a very shaky relationship with one another, and she began a sexual relationship with Epiphany's crime-boss father Terry in order to "punish" John. When he confronted her about this relationship though, she told him that she would not stop unless he was able to retrieve her mother's soul from Hell. John agreed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Hellblazer 276–285|publisher=Vertigo|author=Peter Milligan}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to get his sister to leave Hell, John agreed to track down her son, his adopted nephew, in Ireland.

On October 8, 2012, the series was announced as ending with issue 300, following which a new title, ''[[Constantine (comics)|Constantine]]'' started at the main imprint of DC comics.&lt;ref name=Cancelled/&gt; By 2013, Constantine was contacted by the [[Three Fates]], who tell him that he will finally meet his end in five days. Having lived a good and adventurous life, he happily accepts his fate rather than trying to fight it like he always does. When the last day came, Constantine was ambushed and shot in his own home right in front of a horrified Epiphany. After he died, Epiphany and Finn had an affair as a way to comfort each other. John's ghost saw them having sex in a graveyard and seemed to give his blessing, making the fates decide that John wasn't going to try to come back to life. Then, of course, he did. He contacted Epiphany and asked her to help resurrect him by making him cigarettes from his ashes, which, after he smoked them, made him corporeal again. Thinking to disappear and live happily ever after with Epiphany, they moved to a tiny house in Ireland, courtesy of Finn, that was totally off the grid and far removed from any apparent trouble, the last place anyone would think to look for John. That didn't last long, though, as John realized he can never run from his past.

So John left Epiphany in Ireland and returned to England to confront Gemma. He stole the last dart holding the concoction that killed his demon twin, but ultimately gave it back to Gemma and told her either she could kill him, and live her life without him in but consumed with guilt for killing him, or she could let him disappear from her life forever, without any guilt for murdering him. Gemma shot the dart at him, but John disappeared. The final panel of Hellblazer reveals John, looking shocked and much older than we'd previously seen him, standing in a bar appropriately called "A Long Journey's End" surrounded by people, in front of a shelf full of bottles with the names of the comic's staff over the years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Death and Cigarettes|publisher=Vertigo|author=Peter Milligan|ISBN=1401240933}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Justice League Dark, Constantine'' and ''DC Rebirth''==

In 2011, it was announced that a younger John Constantine would feature in ''[[Justice League Dark]]'', one of the new titles launched as part of September 2011's [[DC Universe]] reboot. He was to be part of a team including [[Shade, The Changing Man]], [[Deadman (DC Comics)|Deadman]] and [[Madame Xanadu]], known as [[Justice League Dark]].&lt;ref name=DCU&gt;{{cite web|title=Justice League Dark interview with Peter Milligan|url=http://www.newsarama.com/comics/dcnu-peter-milligan-justice-league-dark-110609.html|date=31 May 2011|publisher=[[Newsarama]]|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921114112/http://www.newsarama.com/7775-milligan-dcnu-justice-league-spin-off-emotionally-dark.html|archivedate=21 September 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the [[The New 52|DC universe reboot in September 2011]], Peter Milligan started the title which featured an alternate version of John Constantine as a prominent part of the team.&lt;ref name=JLD /&gt; Milligan wrote eight issues of ''Justice League Dark'', with writer [[Jeff Lemire]] taking over on issue nine.

{{Quote box|width=30em|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|quote="[Hellblazer] retains the occult connections, but what sets it apart from the sad, played out "dark fantasies" that you'll find on the shelf next to it is its clear knowledge that real horror is perpetrated not by eye-soiling pantomime monsters, or pale things in black with stupid names.

When [[Garth Ennis]] took over writing, he included his trademark representation of [[racism]] and [[religious fanaticism]], as well his depictions of the [[Falklands War]]. The most controversial writer, [[Brian Azzarello]], tackled issues such as [[neo-Nazism]], [[prison rape]] and [[homosexuality]]. During [[Warren Ellis]]' run, he included American [[school shootings]] in a one-shot issue which led to a major controversy. In his run, [[Peter Milligan]] managed to put [[punk ideology]] in the series, with the protagonist trying to reacquire his former punk self, while also characterizing the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative government]] as a demon infestation with the [[punk subculture]] fighting against this supposed subversion and abuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2010/04/28/committed-why-you-wish-you-read-hellblazer/ |title=Committed: Why You Wish You Read Hellblazer |author=Sonia Harris |publisher=''[[Comic Book Resources]]'' |date=April 28, 2010 |accessdate=December 3, 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121022141824/http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2010/04/28/committed-why-you-wish-you-read-hellblazer/ |archivedate=October 22, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, much of Hellblazer's horror often comes in the crisis and controversies of its time.&lt;ref name="Vulture"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Social"/&gt; Being set in the UK, many famous British personalities have appeared or made cameos such as [[Sid Vicious]], [[Margaret Thatcher]], [[Aleister Crowley]] and [[Alan Moore]].

As stated by Warren Ellis, Hellblazer's major themes were [[Cynicism (contemporary)|cynicism]], [[nihilism]] and "[[Aestheticization of violence|sudden violence]]", with the protagonist oftentimes narrating the story in dark proses with occasional [[Breaking the fourth wall|breaking of the fourth wall]].&lt;ref name="Vulture"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ellis"/&gt; In many story arcs every victory Constantine makes has a negative side effect and often leads to tragedy. His friends, family, and others would be sacrificed or be caught in the crossfire, many of them are dead or have left him. John tries his best to make something good in his life, but most of it leading to failure.&lt;ref name="vert-ency"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pop"/&gt;

The first adaptation of ''Hellblazer'' ever filmed for the screen is one of the scenes in the documentary feature film ''[[The Mindscape of Alan Moore]]'', which was shot in early 2002. The dramatization consists of the John Constantine character wandering through London and, in the film ending, experiencing a mystical [[epiphany (feeling)|epiphany]] of sorts.&lt;ref name=dezvylenz&gt;[http://www.newsarama.com/tv/090822-DezVylenz.html Dez Vylenz: Directing The Mindscape of Alan Moore] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120616035700/http://www.newsarama.com/tv/090822-DezVylenz.html |date=June 16, 2012 }}, ''[[Newsarama]]'', Steve Fritz, September 22, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[2005 in film|2005]], ''[[Constantine (film)|Constantine]]'' was released, a feature film that did not use the same title as the comic book, in order to avoid confusion with the ''[[Hellraiser]]'' horror franchise.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3081">{{Catholic Church Hierarchy}}
An '''Honorary Prelate of His Holiness''' is a priest to whom the [[Pope]] has granted this title. They are addressed as [[Monsignor]] and have certain privileges as regards ecclesiastical dress.&lt;ref name=English&gt;[http://www.fiu.edu/~mirandas/instruction69.htm Instruction on the Dress, Titles and Coat-of-Arms of Cardinals, Bishops and Lesser Prelates] (31 March 1969), English translation published by the Vatican.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Latin&gt;{{cite web|url=http://catholicsites.org/clericaldress/utsivesollicite.html|title=catholicsites.org|work=catholicsites.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Before the [[motu proprio]] ''[[Pontificalis Domus]]'' of 28 March 1968, Honorary Prelates were called Domestic Prelates (in Latin, ''Antistites Urbani''), a title that then also went with certain offices such as that of Archbishop or Bishop Assistant at the Throne or membership of the Roman Prelature, and that was also maintained by Archbishops, Bishops and [[Apostolic Protonotary|Apostolic Protonotaries]] who had been awarded it before their appointment to those positions.&lt;ref name="Annuario"&gt;''Annuario Pontificio'' 2012, p. 1853&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, as well as those to whom the award is granted individually, generally at the request of their bishops, the following are ''ex officio'' Honorary Prelates:
*The members of the Colleges of the Roman Prelatures: Protonotaries ''de numero''; judges of the [[Sacra Rota Romana|Rota]]; clerics of the [[Apostolic Camera]];
*The Judges of the Rota of the [[Apostolic Nunciature]] to [[Spain]];
*Some or all of the members of eight cathedral or collegial [[Chapter (religion)|chapters]] in [[Italy]] and one in [[Poland]].&lt;ref name="Annuario"/&gt;

===Reforms===
With the reforms of ''Pontificalis Domus'', Honorary Prelates were made the second of three ranks of Monsignors. However, [[Pope Francis]], in 2014, decreed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vaticaninsider.lastampa.it/en/the-vatican/detail/articolo/31027/|title=Pope abolishes honorary title of monsignor for diocesan priests under the age of 65|work=lastampa.it}}&lt;/ref&gt; that (allegedly to cut down on clerical "careerism") there would be only one class of Monsignor, the lowest, Chaplain of His Holiness (formerly called Papal Chamberlain, and the category right below Honorary Prelate), and that it would be awarded only to those diocesan priests who were at least 65 years old (these changes did not affect those priests serving in the [[Roman Curia]]; religious order priests can be named Bishops but are not given largely honorary titles such as Monsignor). The higher two categories would be abolished for diocesan priests, but the change is not retroactive—those who have the three grades can still keep them (but they will not be raised to a higher grade).

[[Islam]] is the major religion and the most widespread religion of the [[Maldives]]. It is also the official religion of Maldives. The [[Maldivians]] population consists of over 80 percent&lt;sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; [[Muslim]]s, with about 10 to 15 percent either unaffiliated or of other views.

==History==
[[File:Yousuftabrizi.jpg|thumb|A Plaque in Juma Mosque, Malé, Maldives, on which Abu Al-Rikab Yusuf Al-Tabrezi's name is written. Tabrezi was an Iranian who is said to have converted Maldives in 12th century AD to [[Islam]].]]
[[File:Friday_mosque_minaret_Male1981.jpg|thumb|right|[[Malé Friday Mosque]] Minaret, 1981]]

The importance of the [[Arab people|Arabs]] as traders in the Indian Ocean by the 12th century may partly explain why the last Buddhist king of Maldives [[Dhovemi of the Maldives|Dhovemi]] converted to [[Islam]] in the year 1153 (or 1193, for certain copper plate grants give a later date). 
The king thereupon adopted the [[Muslim]] title and name (in Arabic) of [[Sultan]] (besides the old Divehi title of ''Maha Radun'' or ''Ras Kilege'' or ''Rasgefānu'') Muhammad al Adil, initiating a series of six Islamic dynasties consisting of eighty-four [[sultan]]s and [[sultana (title)|sultanas]] that lasted until 1932 when the sultanate became elective.The formal title of the Sultan up to 1965 was, ''Sultan of Land and Sea, Lord of the twelve-thousand islands and Sultan of the Maldives'' which came with the style ''[[Highness]]''. 
The person traditionally deemed responsible for this conversion was a [[Sunni]] Muslim visitor named Abu al Barakat, or more commonly known as the Shaykh [[Yusuf bin Ahmad al-Kawneyn]]. His venerated tomb now stands on the grounds of [[Malé Friday Mosque|Hukuru Mosque]] in the capital [[Malé]]. Built in 1656, this is the oldest mosque in Maldives. 
Following the Islamic concept that before Islam there was the time of [[Jahiliya]] (ignorance), in the history books used by Maldivians the [[#Introduction of Islam|introduction of Islam]] at the end of the 12th century is considered the cornerstone of the country's history.

Compared to the other areas of South Asia, the conversion of the Maldives to Islam happened relatively late. Arab Traders had converted populations in the [[Malabar Coast]] since the 7th century, and the Muslim General [[Muhammad bin Qasim|Muhammad Bin Qāsim]] had converted of [[Sindh]] and [[Southern Punjab]] to Islam at about the same time. The Maldives remained a Buddhist kingdom for another five hundred years (perhaps the south-westernmost Buddhist country) until the conversion to Islam.

=== Introduction of Islam ===
[[File:Mosque of Hulhumalé.jpg|thumb|Mosque in [[Hulhumalé]]]]
Arab interest in Maldives also was reflected in the residence there in the 1340s of  [[Ibn Battutah]]. The well-known North African traveler wrote how a Maghrebi, one ''Abu Barakat the Berber'', was believed to have been responsible for spreading Islam in the islands, reportedly convincing the local king after having subdued [[Mariamman|Ranna Maari]], a demon coming from the sea.&lt;ref&gt;Ibn Battuta, Travels in Asia and Africa 1325-1354, tr. and ed. H. A. R. Gibb (London: Broadway House, 1929)&lt;/ref&gt; Even though this report has been contested in later sources, it does explain some crucial aspects of Maldivian culture. For instance, historically [[Arabic language|Arabic]] has been the prime language of administration there, instead of the [[Persian language|Persian]] and [[Urdu language|Urdu]] languages used in the nearby Muslim states. Another link to [[North Africa]] was the [[Maliki]] school of jurisprudence, used throughout most of North Africa, which was the official one in the Maldives until the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZF2spo9BKacC The Adventures of Ibn Battuta: A Muslim Traveller of the Fourteenth Century]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars have suggested the possibility of Ibn Battuta misreading Maldive texts,and having a bias towards the North African, Maghrebi narrative of this Shaykh, instead of the East African origins account that was known as well at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Honchell|first=Stephanie|title=Sufis, Sea Monsters, and Miraculous Circumcisions: Comparative Conversion Narratives and Popular Memories of Islamization|volume=|page=5|pages=|year=2018|contribution=|publisher=Fairleigh Dickinson University and the University of Cape Town|quote=In reference to Ibn Batuta's Moroccan theory of this figure, citation 8 of this text mentions, that other accounts identify Yusuf Al Barbari as East African or Persian. But as fellow Maghribi, Ibn Battuta likely felt partial to the Moroccan version.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even when Ibn Battuta visited the islands the governor of the island at that time was [[Abd al-Aziz of Mogadishu|Abd Aziz Al Mogadishawi]], a [[Somalia|Somali]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=1av8DsKezysC&amp;pg=PA58&amp;dq=it+came+into+my+heart+to+go+back+to+maldive&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiqxoLA2Y_cAhVLaVAKHfYyBPwQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=it%20came%20into%20my%20heart%20to%20go%20back%20to%20maldive&amp;f=false|title=Ibn Battuta in the Maldives and Ceylon|last=Defremery|first=C.|date=1999-12|publisher=Asian Educational Services|isbn=9788120612198|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;   

Scholars have posited another scenario where this Abu Barakat might have been a native of [[Berbera]], a significant trading port on the north western coast of [[Somalia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_G5Qpc2dBI |title=Richard Bulliet – History of the World to 1500 CE (Session 22) – Tropical Africa and Asia |publisher=Youtube.com |date=23 November 2010 |accessdate=23 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Barbara'' or ''Barbaroi'' (Berbers), as the ancestors of the [[Somali people|Somalis]] were referred to by medieval [[Arab people|Arab]] and ancient [[Greeks|Greek]] geographers, respectively.&lt;ref name="Bagley22"&gt;F.

According to scholars Abu Barakat Al Barbari was  [[Yusuf bin Ahmad al-Kawneyn]], a famous native [[Somalis|Somali]] scholar &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Writing of the Somali Language: A Great Landmark in Our Revolutionary History|author1=Somalia|author2=Wasaaradda Warfaafinta iyo Hanuuninta Dadweynaha|date=1972|publisher=Ministry of Information and National Guidance|page=10|language=English|quote=Aw Barkhadle, he was a native, who lived in about 1,000 years ago and is buried now in a ruined town named after him, Aw Barkhadle, which is a few miles away from Hargeisa.}}&lt;/ref&gt; known for establishing the [[Walashma dynasty]] of the [[Horn of Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The History of Islam in Africa|author1=Nehemia Levtzion|author2=Randall Pouwels|date=Mar 31, 2000|publisher=Ohio University Press|pages=242|language=English|quote=Aw Barkhadle, is the founder and ancestor of the Walashma dynasty}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his conversion of  the population of Dogor (now known as [[Aw Barkhadle]]), a town in Somalia, he is also credited to have been responsible for spreading Islam in the Maldivian islands, establishing the Hukuru Miskiiy Mosque, and converting the Maldivian population into Islam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mackintosh-Smith|first1=Tim|title=Landfalls: On the Edge of Islam from Zanzibar to the Alhambra|date=2010|publisher=Hodder &amp; Stoughton|pages=384|language=english}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Relations historiques à travers l'océan Indien|last=Galaal|first=Musa|publisher=l'Organisation des Nations Unies pour l'éducation, la science et la culture|year=1980|isbn=92-3-201740-7|location=Belgique|page=28|pages=|chapter=Les liens historiques entre la corne de l'Afrique et les îles du golfe Persique et de l'océan Indien par les voies de l'Islam|quote=Translated from French to English: Now this holy man - this is the new point (Al Kownayn) - seems to be the same as that which the people of the Maldive Islands, near India, called Barakath Al-Barbari who spread Islam in this region as he did in the Horn of Africa. We only know in which of these two regions he lived first and this prompted him to change sectors of business.The tomb of Sheik Barkhadle (Yusuf Al Kownayn) is in a ruined city called Dhogor, near Hargeisa, in the north of the Democratic Republic of Somalia.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ibn Batuta]] states the Maldivian king was converted by Abu Al Barakat Al Berber (Blessed Father of Somalia)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ibn Batuta|editor1-last=Monteil|editor1-first=Vincent|title=Voyages d'Ibn Battuta:Textes et documents retrouves|date=1968|publisher=Anthropos|page=127|language=arabe}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This scenario would also help explain the usage of the Arabic language and the predominance of the Maliki school on the islands. 

Another interpretation, held by the more reliable local historical chronicles, ''Raadavalhi'' and ''Taarikh'',&lt;ref name="Visweswaran2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kamala Visweswaran|title=Perspectives on Modern South Asia: A Reader in Culture, History, and Representation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m-EYXNnvMugC&amp;pg=PA164&amp;dq=candles+ships+jinn&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjUl5DJyuPOAhUGXR4KHZmrBLEQ6AEIPTAG#v=onepage&amp;q=candles%20ships%20jinn&amp;f=false|date=6 May 2011|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-4051-0062-5|pages=164–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sw&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5a_-DAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA50&amp;dq=Islam+in+the+Maldives&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiovbiPiMjSAhXnzVQKHWuNA-I4FBDoAQg_MAY#v=onepage&amp;q=Maldives&amp;f=false|title=Islam Outside the Arab World|editor=Ingvar Svanberg|editor2=David Westerlund|page=250|year=2002|author=Ishtiaq Ahmed}}&lt;/ref&gt; is that Abu Barakat was an Iranian from [[Tabriz]] called Yusuf Shamsud-din, also locally known as Tabrīzugefānu. In the Arabic script the words al-Barbari and al-Tabrizi are very much alike, owing to the fact that at the time, Arabic had several consonants that looked identical and could only be differentiated by overall context (this has since changed by addition of dots above or below letters to clarify pronunciation – For example, the letter "B" in modern Arabic has a dot below, whereas the letter "T" looks identical except there are two dots above it).  The first reference to an Iranian origin dates to an 18th-century Persian text.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul, Ludwig |title=Persian Origins--: Early Judaeo-Persian and the Emergence of New Persian : Collected Papers of the Symposium, Göttingen 1999|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DuKN47W68SkC&amp;pg=PA31|year=2003|publisher=Otto Harrassowitz Verlag|isbn=978-3-447-04731-9|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The much venerated tomb of this saint now stands opposite the grounds of [[Hukuru Miski]], in the centre of [[Malé]].&lt;ref&gt;[[HCP Bell]], ''The Máldive Islands. Monograph on the History, Archæology, and Epigraphy'' with W. L. De Silva, Colombo 1940&lt;/ref&gt;

The Maldives have had a long history of [[Sufi]]c orders, as can be seen in the history of the country such as the building of tombs. They were used until as recently as the 1980s for seeking the help of buried [[saint]]s. They can be seen today next to some old mosques and are considered today as [[cultural heritage]].

Other aspects of [[tassawuf]], such as ritualised [[dhikr]] ceremonies called Maulūdu ([[Mawlid]]) — the [[liturgy]] of which included recitations and certain supplications in a melodical tone—existed until very recent times. These Maulūdu festivals were held in ornate tents specially built for the occasion. At present Islam is the official religion of the entire population, as adherence to it is required for citizenship.

[[Islam]] is the state religion of [[Maldives]], and adherence to it is legally required for citizens by a revision of the constitution in 2008: Article 9, Section D ''states that a non-Muslim may not become a citizen of the Maldives.''&lt;ref name=ct2010&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OgIhbPBWlkwC&amp;pg=PA34&amp;dq=Islam+in+the+Maldives&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiovbiPiMjSAhXnzVQKHWuNA-I4FBDoAQhKMAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Islam%20in%20the%20Maldives&amp;f=false|title=Constitutional Theocracy|author=Ran Hirschl|year=2010|publisher=Harvard University Press|page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The traditional [[Sharia|Islamic law]] code of [[shariah]], known in [[Dhivehi language|Dhivehi]] as [[sariatu]], forms the Maldives' basic code of law, as interpreted to conform to local Maldivian conditions by the President, the attorney general, the Ministry of Home Affairs, and the Majlis. On the inhabited islands, the ''miski'', or mosque, forms the central place where Islam is practiced. Because Friday is the most important day for Muslims to attend mosque, shops and offices in towns and villages close around 11 a.m., and the sermon begins by 12:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.

[[Adhan]] (prayer) sessions are held five times daily. [[Muezzin|Mudimu]], the mosque caretakers, make the call. Most shops and offices close for fifteen minutes after each call. During the ninth Muslim month of [[Ramadan]], cafés and restaurants are closed during the day, and working hours are limited.

== Mosques ==
Most inhabited Maldivian islands have several [[mosque]]s; [[Malé]] has more than thirty. Most traditional mosques are whitewashed buildings constructed of coral stone with corrugated iron or thatched roofs.

In Malé, the Islamic Center and the Grand Friday Mosque, built in 1984 with funding from the [[Persian Gulf states]], [[Pakistan]], [[Brunei]], and [[Malaysia]], are imposing elegant structures. The gold-colored dome of this mosque is the first structure sighted when approaching Malé. In mid-1991 Maldives had a total of 725 mosques and 266 women's mosques.&lt;ref&gt;[http://countrystudies.us/maldives/7.htm Helen Chapin Metz, ed. Maldives: A Country Study.

==Radicalism==
In the late 1990s the spread of [[Wahhabism]] challenged more traditional Islamic practices. After the 2004 tsunami, Saudi-funded preachers gained even more influence.&lt;ref name=itimes&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/asia-pacific/tourists-blissfully-unaware-of-islamist-tide-in-maldives-1.1898425|title=Tourists blissfully unaware of Islamist tide in Maldives|date=August 16, 2014|work=Irish Times|author=Mary Boland}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=g150226&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/feb/26/paradise-jihadis-maldives-islamic-extremism-syria|title=Paradise jihadis: Maldives sees surge in young Muslims leaving for Syria|work=Guardian|date=February 26, 2015|author=Jason Burke}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Islamic Reporting Initiative''' (IRI) is an independent [[Nonprofit organization|not-for-profit organization]] leading the creation of the IRI standard; the guiding [[Integrated reporting|integrated]] Corporate [[Sustainability]] and Social Responsibility ([[Corporate social responsibility|CSR]]) [[Sustainability reporting|reporting]] standard based on [[Five Pillars of Islam|Islamic principles and values]] that works towards achieving [[international standards]] of best practice. The framework will enable organizations to inclusively assess, report, verify and certify their CSR and [[Philanthropy|philanthropic]] programs supporting the [[Sustainable Development Goals|United Nations Sustainable Development Goals]].

Founded on 4 April 2015, the IRI seeks to make CSR reporting standard practice in organizations across the [[Muslim world|Islamic world]] and [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation|OIC]] countries in particular. The IRI is headquartered in [[The Netherlands]], and (as of 2016) has members in more than 50 countries.&lt;ref&gt;https://islamicreporting.org/sign-up/members/list-of-members-per-country/&lt;/ref&gt; 
In 2015, the IRI was commended by the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), the second largest inter-governmental organization after the [[United Nations]], with membership of 57 states over four continents.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oic-oci.org/oicv2/states/?lan=en&lt;/ref&gt;

== Vision and Mission ==
The [[Goal|vision]] of the IRI is a sustainable [[global economy]] that contributes actively to [[society]] and the [[environment (biophysical)|environment]] integrating the values of [[peace]], [[compassion]], [[Toleration|tolerance]], [[righteousness]], [[environmental stewardship]] and [[human dignity]] into [[corporate culture]].

The [[mission statement|mission]] of the IRI is to enable organizations throughout [[the world]] to examine the values that guide their [[activities (disambiguation)|activities]] and express with [[Transparency (behavior)|clarity]] and [[simplicity]] their contribution to sustainability in society and the environment.

The IRI aims to provide a range of internationally recognized [[business]] tools, [[guidelines]] and standards to accelerate the mainstream [[implementation]] of the shared post-2015 goals as outlined in both the OIC-2025 plan of action and the UN Sustainable Development Goals 2030.

== Overview ==
The IRI was created in response to [[research]] that identified low rates of sustainability and CSR reporting despite a [[prevalence]] of sustainability and CSR practice in organizations where Islamic principles and values are an important element of [[corporate culture]]. Such findings indicate that existing sustainability [[Sustainability standards and certification|reporting standards]], such as the [[Global Reporting Initiative|Global Reporting Initiative (GRI)]] and [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO Standards]], among others, are not always as practical or relevant in a local and cultural context.

The IRI is a culturally-responsive reporting framework based on [[Five Pillars of Islam|Islamic principles]] and values and the embedded widespread practice of [[philanthropy]]. Such values shape [[organizational culture]]s and ground CSR as an economic and moral [[initiative]], founded on the understanding that an organization aspires to be a ‘[[Corporate Citizenship|good corporate citizen]]’. The framework will be compatible with elements specific to the culture, such as [[Zakat]] and other organizational [[Code of conduct|codes of conduct]]. At the same time, the IRI framework will be compatible with [[Sharia-compliant finance|Sharia compliant finance]], one of the fastest growing types of [[finance]]:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2015/09/prasad.htm&lt;/ref&gt; between 2009 and 2013 Islamic banking assets grew at an annual rate of 17.6%, and are expected to grow annually by an average of 19.7% until 2018.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.economist.com/news/finance-and-economics/21617014-market-islamic-financial-products-growing-fast-big-interest-no-interest&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2017, the IRI was recognized by the Cambridge IF Analytica Global Islamic Finance Report (GIFR) as one of the leading initiatives in Islamic Finance in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;http://gifr.net/publications/gifr2017/contributors.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The IRI deems the need for CSR reporting to be culturally-responsive in order to maximize the nuances that lend themselves to the overall ambition of CSR and to maximize [[stakeholder engagement]]. With CSR reports primarily used by stakeholders, it is important that the motivations for CSR practice are framed within the local context and use a [[language]] that is familiar, meaningful and relatable to [[culture]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.makingitmagazine.net/?p=9128&lt;/ref&gt; Once such a framework "fits into its place", it creates stable, [[flourishing]] and interconnected [[Economy|economic]], social and [[Culture|cultural]] environments.

The IRI enables CSR and sustainability metrics to be incorporated into wider [[Business practices|business practice]] through the integrated nature of the framework. [[Corporate social responsibility|CSR]] and [[sustainability reporting]] is a concept encouraging businesses and institutions to report on their social and [[Environmental Performance Index|environmental performance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Herzig|first=Christian|title=Corporate Sustainability Reporting. An Overview|year=2006|pages=301–324|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/p2w07322h317n005/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The combination of non-financial and financial metrics provides an additional layer of information important to stakeholders and [[investor]]s in the [[measurement]] and [[Risk management|management]] of [[Business risks|risk]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/eu-non-financial-reporting-how-richard-howitt&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="72334">Included are prominent authors who have made [[Islamic studies|studies concerning Islam]], the religion and its civilization, and the culture of Muslim peoples. Not included are those studies of Islam produced by Muslim authors meant primarily for a Muslim audience.&lt;ref&gt;Many general and specific reference sources were used for the very wide variety of authors herein. The general sources employed include: [[Peri Bearman|Bearman]], Bianquis, [[Clifford Edmund Bosworth|Bosworth]], van Donzel, &amp; [[Wolfhart Heinrichs|Heinrichs]] (editors), ''Encyclopaedia of Islam,'' 2nd Edition., 12 vols. (Leiden: E. J. Brill, 1960-2005); Brandon (editor), ''Dictionary of Comparative Religion'' (New York: Scribners 1970); Norman Daniel, ''Islam and the West'' (Edinburgh Univ. 1958); [[John L. Esposito]], ''Oxford Dictionary of Islam'' (Oxford Univ. 2003); [[Hamilton Gibb|Gibb]] &amp; Kramers (editors), ''Shorter Encyclopaedia of Islam'' (Leiden: Brill 1953; Cyril Glassé, ''The Concise Encyclopedia of Islam'' (San Francisco: HarperCollins 1989).&lt;/ref&gt;

Herein most of the authors from the early centuries of Islam belonged to non-Muslim societies, cultures, or religions. The primary intent of many early works was to inform non-Muslims about a distant and/or unfamiliar Islam; some were clearly polemical in motivation and cannot be termed objective. As time went on, academic standards were developed generally, and were increasingly applied to studies of Islam. Many of the authors here are of Christian provenance, yet there are also Jewish, Zoroastrian, Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Taoist, Confucian, Communist, and secular points of view. The most recent entries are often sourced in universities, and include works by Muslim professors whose publications address a worldwide audience.&lt;ref&gt;The entries usually include bibliographic citations to works of the authors. These also may serve as reference sources for further inquiry.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Johannes Buxtorf.gif|thumb|right|200px|Johannes Buxtorf]]
'''Johannes Buxtorf'''&lt;ref&gt;also spelled as '''Buxtorff''' in the [[Palestine Exploration Fund]] Quarterly Statement for 1894&lt;/ref&gt; (December 25, 1564{{snd}}September 13, 1629) was a celebrated [[Hebraist]], member of a family of [[oriental studies|Orientalist]]s; professor of [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] for thirty-nine years at [[Basel]] and was known by the title, "Master of the [[Rabbi]]s".{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} His massive tome, ''De Synagoga Judaica'' (1st. ed. 1603), scrupulously documents the customs and society of [[German Jewry]] in the early modern period.

Buxtorf was the father of [[Johannes Buxtorf II|Johannes Buxtorf the Younger]].

==Life==

Buxtorf was born at [[Kamen]] in [[Westphalia]]. The original form of the name was Bockstrop, or Boxtrop, from which was derived the family crest, which bore the figure of a goat (Ger. Bock, he-goat). After the death of his father, who was minister of Kamen, Buxtorf studied at Marburg and the newly founded [[Herborn Academy]], at the latter of which [[Caspar Olevian]] (1536–1587) and [[Johannes Piscator]] (1546–1625) had been appointed professors of theology. At a later date Piscator received the assistance of Buxtorf in the preparation of his Latin translation of the Old Testament, published at Herborn in 1602-1603. From Herborn Buxtorf went to Heidelberg, and thence to Basel, attracted by the reputation of [[Johann Jakob Grynaeus]] and [[J. G. Hospinian]] (1515–1575).&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Buxtorf, Johannes (1564-1629)|display=Buxtorf, Johannes|volume=4|pages=893-894}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a short residence at Basel, he studied successively under [[Heinrich Bullinger]] (1504–1575) at Zürich and [[Theodore Beza]] at Geneva. On his return to Basel, Grynaeus, desirous that the services of so promising a scholar should be secured to the university, procured him a situation as tutor in the family of Leo Curio, son of [[Celio Secondo Curione]], well known for his sufferings on account of the Reformed faith. At the insistence of Grynaeus, Buxtorf undertook the duties of the Hebrew chair in the university, and discharged them for two years with such ability that at the end of that time he was unanimously appointed to the vacant office. From this date (1591) to his death in 1629 he remained in Basel, and devoted himself with remarkable zeal to the study of Hebrew and rabbinic literature. He received into his house many learned Jews, that he might discuss his difficulties with them, and he was frequently consulted by Jews themselves on matters relating to their ceremonial law. He seems to have well deserved the title which was conferred upon him of "Master of the Rabbins." His partiality for Jewish society brought him, indeed, on one occasion into trouble with the authorities of the city, the laws against the Jews being very strict. Nevertheless, on the whole, his relations with the city of Basel were friendly. He remained firmly attached to the university which first recognized his merits, and declined two invitations from the [[University of Leiden]] and [[Academy of Saumur]] successively. His correspondence with the most distinguished scholars of the day was very extensive; the library of the university of Basel contains a rich collection of letters, which are valuable for a literary history of the time.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

* '''Manuale Hebraicum et Chaldaicum''' (1602; 7th ed., 1658).
* '''Synagoga Judaica''' (1603 in German; afterwards translated into Latin in an enlarged form), a valuable repertory of information regarding the opinions and ceremonies of the Jews.

* His great Rabbinical Bible, '''Biblic Hebraica cum Paraphr. Chald. et Commentariis Rabbinorum''' (2 vols., 1618; 4 vols., 1618–1619), containing, in addition to the Hebrew text, the Aramaic Paraphrases of Targums, punctuated after the analogy of the Aramaic passages in Ezra and Daniel (a proceeding which has been condemned by [[Richard Simon (priest)|Richard Simon]] and others), and the Commentaries of the more celebrated Rabbis, with various other treatises.
* '''Tiberias, sive Commentarius Masoreticus''' (1620; quarto edition, improved and enlarged by J. Buxtorf the younger, 1665), so named from the great school of Jewish criticism which had its seat in the town of [[Tiberias]]. It was in this work that Buxtorf controverted the views of [[Elia Levita|Elias Levita]] regarding the late origin of the Hebrew vowel points, a subject which gave rise to the controversy between [[Louis Cappel]] and his son [[Johannes Buxtorf II]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

Buxtorf did not live to complete the two works on which his reputation chiefly rests, his ''Lexicon Chaldaicum, Talmudicum, et Rabbinicum'', and the ''Concordantiae Bibliorum Hebraicorum'', both of which were edited by his son. The lexicon was republished at Leipzig in 1869 with some additions by [[Bernard Fischer]], and the concordance was assumed by [[Julius Fürst]] as the basis of his own Hebrew concordance, which appeared in 1840.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; [[File:Buxtorf_Concordance_Basel_1632.jpg|thumb|right|Frontispiece of Buxtorf's concordance, Basel, 1632]]

[[Wilhelm Gesenius]] wrote in 1815 that he considered Buxtorf's Hebrew grammar the best yet written.&lt;ref&gt;Steven W. Holloway, ed., ''Orientalism, Assyriology and the Bible'', Hebrew Bible Monographs, 10; Sheffield Phoenix Press, 2006; {{ISBN|978-1-905048-37-3}}; p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John William Brodie-Innes''' ( 10 March 1848 – 8 December 1923 ) was a leading member of the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]]'s Amen-Ra Temple in [[Edinburgh]].

J.W. Brodie- Innes was born at Downe in Kent,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://libindx.moray.gov.uk/subjects/subject_people_report_view.asp?REF_ID%3DNM011538 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-09-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140908155056/http://libindx.moray.gov.uk/subjects/subject_people_report_view.asp?REF_ID=NM011538 |archivedate= 8 September 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; where his Scottish born father Rev. [[John Brodie Innes]] ( 1815-1894 ) had been Vicar from 1846. His father was a friend and confidant of a neighbour at Downe, [[Charles Darwin]]. A lawyer by profession, he was a member of the Sette of Odde Volumes ( a London bibliophile society ), and was its president in 1911. He wrote several novels on witchcraft and magic and is believed to have been one of [[Dion Fortune]]'s occult teachers. (Fortune was also taught by such occult practitioners as [[Moina Mathers]] and Dr Theodore Moriarty).

Throughout the dissensions of the Golden Dawn, Brodie-Innes remained loyal to [[Samuel Liddell MacGregor Mathers|MacGregor Mathers]], and on the death of his chief in 1918 published an affectionate obituary titled "MacGregor Mathers - Some Personal Reminiscences"&lt;ref&gt;( {{cite web|url=http://www.esotericgoldendawn.com/tradition_macgregorreminiscences.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-12-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101123190959/http://esotericgoldendawn.com/tradition_macgregorreminiscences.htm |archivedate=23 November 2010 |df= }} ) - Article reprinted from ''[[The Occult Review]]'', Vol. 29, No. 5 ( May 1919 ), pp. 284-286.&lt;/ref&gt; in the May 1919 issue of ''[[The Occult Review]]''.

'''José Nakens''' (1841–1926) was a Spanish journalist, [[anticlerical]], and [[Republican faction (Spanish Civil War)|republican activist]].&lt;ref name="Gran"&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia |title=José Nakens |url=https://www.enciclopedia.cat/EC-GEC-0045308.xml |encyclopedia=[[Gran Enciclopèdia Catalana]] |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Morral affair ==

{{main|Morral affair}}

Following his attempted bombing of [[Spanish King]] [[Alfonso XIII]]'s vehicle on return from his wedding in May 1906, which killed 24 bystanders and military, wounded over 100, and left the royals unscathed, the anarchist fugitive Mateo Morral sought refuge from Nakens.{{sfn|Sanabria|2009|p=101, 105}} Nakens was a vocal opponent of anarchism, but his anticlerical leadership attracted such radicals.{{sfn|Sanabria|2009|p=102}} Historians have disagreed as to whether Morral's choice of approaching Nakens was premeditated,{{sfn|Sanabria|2009|p=105}} but Morral was likely introduced to Nakens through Ferrer's school, which purchased the journalist's anticlerical writings.{{sfn|Sanabria|2009|p=108}} Morral introduced himself as the assassin upon entering Nakens' printing press and recounted how Nakens had previously helped [[Michele Angiolillo]], the Italian anarchist who had assassinated the [[Spanish Prime Minister]] in 1897. Nakens was hesitant but agreed to help. He hid Morral at the press while arranging lodging for Morral, and returned 90 minutes later to transport him to a friend's house for the night. But Morral grew distrustful during the night and was gone by morning. The fugitive died a day later.{{sfn|Sanabria|2009|p=105}}

On the day of Morral's death, the republican journalist José Nakens had published a denunciation of the regicide attempt and terrorism writ large in his journal, ''El Motín'', without mentioning Morral or Nakens' own harboring of the fugitive.{{sfn|Sanabria|2009|pp=106–107}} He was arrested within the week and the next day published a full accounting of his actions in two newspapers, in which he reaffirmed his opposition to anarchism, described Morral's attack as cowardly, and recanted his brief support of Morral as misguided but driven by his desire to help his fellow man.{{sfn|Sanabria|2009|p=107}}

The judgement in Nakens' case came easily. While the court believed that Nakens had no prior connection with Morral, they found that his planning for Morral was more deliberate than a brief lapse of judgement. They argued that this aid led to Morral's pre-suicide murder of a villager, and for this aid, sentenced Nakens to nine years of prison and financial restitution for the Royals, the military, and families affected by the bombing.{{sfn|Sanabria|2009|p=107}} Nakens' friends Bernardo Mata and Isidro Ibarra were jailed as well.{{sfn|Sanabria|2009|p=109}} Only half of his prison time between his June 1906 arrest and June 1907 sentencing was [[Commutation (law)|commuted]]. For Nakens' initial months, he could not bear to read the newspapers and was not aware of the republican campaign for his royal pardon.{{sfn|Sanabria|2009|p=109}}

In Madrid's [[Cárcel Modelo]] prison, Nakens became an advocate for prison reform. He received unlimited space in a republican daily newspaper, ''El País'', where he wrote about sordid prison conditions and, in turn, improved his standing with those previously upset by his harboring of Morral. Nakens wrote about prisoner malnourishment, disease, lack of heating, neglect from underpaid guards, and uncomforting clergy. He renewed calls for a more secular and humane prison system as a platform that combined his anticlericalism with the issue of prison reform.{{sfn|Sanabria|2009|p=109}}

Simultaneously, a campaign mounted for Nakens' pardon. Even before his sentencing, republican papers called for his release, the prime minister and his cabinet received international letters daily, and prison officials described Nakens as a reformed, model prisoner.{{sfn|Sanabria|2009|pp=109–110}} Ultimately, President [[Antonio Maura]] recommended the pardon of Nakens and his friends in May 1908, which Alfonso XIII granted.{{sfn|Sanabria|2009|p=110}}

The affair spotlighted Spanish republican fissures that would become an identity crisis,{{sfn|Sanabria|2009|p=102}} as Nakens impatiently broke from the [[gradualist]] philosophy of the old generation of republicans{{sfn|Sanabria|2009|p=121}} and both republican factions showed intransigence towards cooperation.{{sfn|Sanabria|2009|p=122}} Fallout from the affair appeared to favor the republican moderates ([[Gumersindo de Azcárate]], [[Nicolás Salmerón]]), who condemned the radical, young republicans ([[Alejandro Lerroux]], [[Vicente Blasco Ibáñez]]){{sfn|Sanabria|2009|p=102}} and made Nakens appear, by juxtaposition, to be unstable.{{sfn|Sanabria|2009|p=122}} This schism appeared to hasten the coming revolution.{{sfn|Sanabria|2009|p=102}}&lt;!-- thesis statement, add citations for evidence, as needed--&gt;

&lt;!-- is this too off-topic? --&gt;In hindsight, historian Enrique Sanabria proposes Nakens as a tragic parable: that Nakens' decision to hide Morral reflected a willingness to work with revolutionaries that, when pronounced, would ostracize him from his more moderate republican colleagues.{{sfn|Sanabria|2009|p=122}} Nakens was shortsighted to believe that his messages of egalitarianism, democracy, and cultural revolution would not appeal to the leftists he sought to avoid,{{sfn|Sanabria|2009|p=120}} and his popularity within anarchist and radical circles reflected anticlericalism's status as a uniting force across the left. But whereas anticlericalism was attached to nationalism for republicans like Nakens, it was not necessarily attached for anarchists and socialists.{{sfn|Sanabria|2009|pp=110, 115, 120}} Nakens "became political roadkill" in the aftermath of the affair for his inability to draw an audience of workers while tolerating their revolutionary politics.{{sfn|Sanabria|2009|p=119}}

== Renewed anticlericalism ==

Upon his release from prison, Nakens worked out of poverty until he could reopen ''El Motín'' in October 1908. Further radicalized, he planned to make radical anticlericalism its primary message. The periodical was present through the dictatorship of [[Miguel Primo de Rivera]].{{sfn|Sanabria|2009|p=110}}

The '''''Kongzi Jiayu''''' ({{zh|t=孔子家語|s=孔子家语|p=Kǒngzǐ Jiāyǔ|w=K'ung Tzu Chia Yü|first=t}}), translated as '''''The School Sayings of Confucius'''''{{sfn|Kramers|1950}} or '''''Family Sayings of Confucius''''',{{sfn|Shen|2013|p=87}} is a collection of sayings of [[Confucius]] (Kongzi), written as a supplement to the ''[[Analects]]'' (''Lunyu'').{{sfn|Kramers|1950|p=2}}

A book by the title had existed since at least the early [[Han dynasty]] (206 BC – 220 AD), and was listed in the 1st-century imperial bibliography ''[[Yiwenzhi]]'' with 27 scrolls. The extant version, however, was compiled by the [[Cao Wei]] official-scholar [[Wang Su]] (195–256 AD), and contains 10 scrolls and 44 sections.&lt;ref name=china&gt;{{cite web |url=http://culture.china.com.cn/guoxue/2010-04/22/content_19883610.htm |script-title=zh:中國歷代對《孔子家語》的研究 |language=Chinese |date=2010-04-22 |work=Culture China}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chinese scholars had long concluded that the received text was a 3rd-century forgery by Wang Su that had nothing to do with the original text of the same title,{{sfn|Kramers|1950|p=2}} but this verdict has been overturned by archaeological discoveries of [[Western Han]] dynasty tombs at [[Dingzhou]] (55 BC) and [[Shuanggudui]] (165 BC).&lt;ref name=china/&gt;

In the postface to the ''Kongzi Jiayu'', its author describes the collection as discussions Confucius had with [[disciples of Confucius|his disciples]] and others, recorded by his disciples. Selected discussions were published as the ''[[Analects]]'' (''Lunyu''), while the rest was collected in the ''Jiayu''.{{sfn|Kramers|1950|p=3}} This characterization is consistent with the content of the ''Jiayu'', which contains nearly all the Confucian lore found in such diverse ancient texts as the ''[[Zuozhuan]]'', ''[[Guoyu (book)|Guoyu]]'', ''[[Mencius (book)|Mencius]]'', ''[[Han Feizi (book)|Han Feizi]]'', ''[[Book of Rites]]'', ''[[Han Shi Waizhuan]]'', ''[[Lüshi Chunqiu]]'', ''[[Huainanzi]]'', etc., except what is included in the ''Analects'', the ''[[Classic of Filial Piety]]'', and a few other works.{{sfn|Kramers|1950|pp=3–4}}

The topics covered by the ''Kongzi Jiayu'' include Confucius' detailed ancestry, his parents, his birth, episodes and events from his life, and his sayings.{{sfn|Kramers|1950|pp=6–9}} [[Disciples of Confucius|His disciples]] also feature prominently, including one section devoted entirely to [[Yan Hui]], Confucius' favourite.{{sfn|Kramers|1950|p=7}} In all, 76 disciples are mentioned by name.{{sfn|Shen|2013|p=87}}

==Influence and controversy==
The postface to the ''Kongzi Jiayu'' asserts that it was compiled by [[Kong Anguo]], an influential scholar and descendant of Confucius who lived in the 2nd century BC, from actual recordings of Confucius' sayings made by his disciples.{{sfn|Kramers|1950|p=17}} Soon after Wang Su, who was a critic of the scholar [[Zheng Xuan]], published his version of the ''Jiayu'', Ma Zhao (馬昭), a follower of Zheng, declared that it had been "amended and enlarged" by Wang.{{sfn|Kramers|1950|pp=16–17}}

Despite lingering doubts about its authenticity, the ''Jiayu'' was influential throughout the [[Tang dynasty|Tang]] and [[Song dynasty|Song]] dynasties. [[Sima Zhen]], author of an important commentary to [[Sima Qian]]'s ''[[Shiji]]'', valued it as highly as the ''Shiji'' itself.{{sfn|Kramers|1950|pp=20–21}} [[Zhu Xi]], the leading [[Neo-Confucianist]], also held it in high regard.{{sfn|Kramers|1950|p=23}}

A new rationalist intellectual movement, [[Han learning]], gained influence during the [[Qing dynasty]] and began a thorough criticism of the ''Kongzi Jiayu'' and other purportedly authentic ancient works.{{sfn|Kramers|1950|p=28}} A large number of scholars, including Sun Zhizu (孫志祖), Fan Jiaxiang (范家相), Yao Jiheng (姚際恒), Cui Shu (崔述), Pi Xirui (皮錫瑞), Wang Pinzhen (王聘珍), and [[Ding Yan]], all reached the same verdict that the ''Jiayu'' was a forgery. Sun and Fan both wrote detailed analyses supporting their conclusion.&lt;ref name=china/&gt; Although the ''Jiayu'' had its defenders, represented by Chen Shike (陳士珂), they were a small minority.&lt;ref name=china/&gt;

In the 20th century, [[Gu Jiegang]], the leading force of the highly influential [[Doubting Antiquity School]], reaffirmed the Qing scholars' conclusion that the ''Kongzi Jiayu'' was a forgery by Wang Su, and called it "worthless" for the study of Confucius. As a result, few modern scholars studied the work.&lt;ref name=china/&gt;

==Western scholarship==
Due to the controversy surrounding the ''Kongzi Jiayu'', and the fact that much of its content was known from other ancient texts, early Western sinologists did not pay much attention to the work.{{sfn|Kramers|1950|p=2}} A few, however, including [[James Legge]], [[Alfred Forke]], and [[Richard Wilhelm (sinologist)|Richard Wilhelm]], believed the ''Jiayu'' was authentic, despite the forgery verdict reached by the Chinese scholars.{{sfn|Kramers|1950|p=13}}

Robert Paul Kramers translated the first ten sections of the ''Kongzi Jiayu'' into English, published in 1950 under the title ''K'ung Tzu Chia Yü: The School Sayings of Confucius''.{{sfn|Kramers|1950}} In his introduction, Kramers rejects the possibility that Wang Su may have forged the entire work.{{sfn|Goldin|1999|p=135}}

==Archaeological discoveries==
In 1973, Chinese archaeologists excavated a large [[Western Han]] dynasty tomb in Bajiaolang, [[Dingzhou]], [[Hebei]] province,{{sfn|Van Els|2009|p=911}} which was dated to 55 BC.{{sfn|Van Els|2009|p=919}} Among the [[bamboo strips]] discovered in the tomb was a text entitled ''Ru Jia Zhe Yan'' ({{zh|c=儒家者言}}, "Words of the Ru (Confucian) Lineage"), which bears great similarities to the ''Kongzi Jiayu''.{{sfn|Van Els|2009|p=921}}&lt;ref name=chen&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.guoxue.com/?p=23084 |author=Chen Youbing (陈友冰) |script-title=zh:中国历代著名家教选介(二): 孔子家语 |language=Chinese |date=2014-09-18 |work=Guoxue}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1977, archaeologists discovered the [[Shuanggudui]] tomb, sealed in 165 BC, in [[Fuyang]], [[Anhui]] province. A wooden board found in the tomb contains the table of contents of ''Ru Jia Zhe Yan'', which is also very similar to the received text of the ''Kongzi Jiayu''.{{sfn|Shaughnessy|2014|pp=189–190}}

These archaeological discoveries, together with research on the [[Shanghai Museum bamboo slips]], and publication of the ''Kongzi Jiayu'' text from the [[International Dunhuang Project|Dunhuang manuscripts]] in the [[British Library]], have convinced many scholars that the received text of the ''Kongzi Jiayu'' could not have been forged by Wang Su,&lt;ref name=china/&gt;&lt;ref name=chen/&gt; and could well have been compiled by Kong Anguo, as Wang had claimed.&lt;ref name=china/&gt; Scholars are now paying renewed attention to the text. [[Yang Chaoming]] (楊朝明), author of the 2005 book ''Kongzi Jiayu Tongjie'' (孔子家語通解), considers the ''Kongzi Jiayu'' no less valuable than the ''Analects'' to the study of Confucius.&lt;ref name=china/&gt;

{{Expand list|date=November 2012}}

==Afterlife==
{{See also|Afterlife}}

==Clericalism==
{{See also|Clericalism}}
* [[Philip Pullman]]'s ''[[His Dark Materials]]'' series is heavy with [[anticlericalism|anticlerical]] themes. [[Catholicism|The Catholic Church]] is depicted as an over-controlling, power-rich entity. In the trilogy's second book, ''[[The Subtle Knife]]'', a plan emerges to declare war against [[heaven]], and to destroy God's regent [[Metatron]] in order to give the world true [[free will]].

==Creation myths==

{{See also|Christ}}
* [[C.S. Lewis]]' ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia]]'' abound in Christian [[allegory]]. [[Aslan]], the divine creator and protector of [[Narnia (world)|Narnia]], is envisioned not simply as an analogue to [[Jesus of Nazareth]], but rather as a fantastic alternate version of [[Christ]] himself. For example, in ''[[The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe]]'', an allegorical retelling of the [[Gospels]], Aslan offers himself up as a sacrifice in place of the traitorous Edmund, and is mocked, tortured, executed and subsequently resurrected. Aslan himself blatantly alludes to his nature as an alternate Christ in the final scene of ''[[The Voyage of the Dawn Treader]]'', wherein he reveals to the protagonists Edmund, Lucy and Eustace that in their own world, he is known by "another name", and that they must learn to know him by that name.

Tolkien's Pagan Fairy World|date=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the creation myth of ''[[Ainulindalë]]'' the Ainur compose the great music before time begins with the harmony being disrupted by Melkor's "loud and vain" music&lt;!--quote p17 Silmarillion--&gt; as he contends with [[Eru Ilúvatar]] (his own creator), attempting to alter the Music and introduce what he believed to be elements purely of his own design. Later Ilúvatar takes the Ainur to see how the music, at the end of the void, created [[Arda (Tolkien)|Arda]], the fictional Middle-earth. Melkor then desires to rule Arda and later becomes the source from whom all evil in the world of Middle-earth ultimately stems.

'''Lucus Feroniae''' was an ancient [[sacred grove]] (''"[[lucus]]"'') dedicated to the [[Sabine]] goddess [[Feronia (mythology)|Feronia]]. It was located in [[Etruria]], across the ancient [[Via Tiberina]], in what is now the territory of the modern commune of [[Capena]], [[Lazio]], next to the border with the neighbouring comune of [[Fiano Romano]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pleiades.stoa.org/places/413184 |title=Places: 413184 (Lucus Feroniae) |author=Harris, W., DARMC, R. Talbert, S. Gillies, T. Elliott, J. Becker |accessdate=December 18, 2014 &lt;!-- 2:56 pm --&gt;  |publisher=Pleiades}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was visited both by [[Latins (Italic tribe)|Latins]] and [[Sabines]] even in the time of [[Tullus Hostilius]] and was plundered by [[Hannibal]] in 211 BCE. In [[Roman Empire|Imperial]] times it became an independent community receiving a colony of [[Augustus|Octavian]]'s veterans (''Colonia Iulia felix Lucoferensis'') and possessing an [[amphitheatre]], capable of housing up to 5,000 spectators, a [[basilica]], a forum, baths and numerous other edifices. See ''[[Feronia (Etruria)]].

A museum houses parts of statues, some of them with interchangeable hands and heads, depending from the current emperor ruling.

'''Maud Gonne MacBride''' ({{lang-ga|Maud Nic Ghoinn Bean Mac Giolla Bhríghde}}, 21 December 1866 – 27 April 1953) was an English-born [[Irish people|Irish]] revolutionary, [[suffragist|suffragette]] and actress.  Of [[Anglo-Irish]] descent, she was won over to [[Irish nationalism]] by the plight of evicted people in the [[Land War]]s.  She also actively agitated for [[Home Rule]].

==Early life==
She was born at [[Tongham]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | year = 1881 | work = Census | title = Rosemont School, Tormoham, Devon}}.&lt;/ref&gt; near [[Farnham]], Surrey, as ''Edith Maud Gonne'', the eldest daughter of Captain Thomas Gonne (1835–86) of the [[17th Lancers]], whose ancestors hailed from [[Caithness]] in Scotland, and his wife, Edith Frith Gonne, born Cook (1844–71).  After her mother died while Maud was still a child, her father sent her to a boarding school in France to be educated. "The Gonnes came from [[County Mayo]], but my great-great grandfather was disinherited and sought fortune abroad trading in Spanish wine," she wrote. "My grandfather was head of a prosperous firm with houses in London and Oporto – he destined my father to take charge of the foreign business and had him educated abroad. My father spoke 6 languages but had little taste for business, so he got a commission in the English army; his gift for languages secured for him diplomatic appointments in Austria, the Balkans and Russia, and he was as much at home in Paris as in Dublin."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.bureauofmilitaryhistory.ie/reels/bmh/BMH.WS0317.pdf |title=Bureau of military history| accessdate= 10 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early career==
In 1882 her father, an army officer, was posted to [[Dublin]]. She accompanied him and remained with him until his death. She returned to France after a bout of [[tuberculosis]] and fell in love with a [[right-wing politics|right wing politician]], [[Lucien Millevoye]]. They agreed to fight for Irish independence and to regain [[Alsace-Lorraine]] for France. She returned to Ireland and worked tirelessly for the release of Irish [[political prisoner]]s from jail.  In 1889, she first met [[W. B. Yeats]], who fell in love with her.

In 1890 she returned to France where she once again met Millevoye and had a son, Georges, with him.  Georges died, possibly of [[meningitis]], in 1891. Gonne was distraught, and buried him in a large memorial chapel built for him with money she had inherited. Her distress remained with her; in her will she asked for Georges's baby shoes to be interred with her, but made no mention of the daughter born a few years after him. In Dublin, London and Paris she was attracted to the occultist and spiritualist worlds deeply important to Yeats, asking his friends about the reality of [[reincarnation]]. In 1891 she briefly joined the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]], a [[magical organisation]] with which Yeats had involved himself.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, p. 140&lt;/ref&gt; Gonne separated from Millevoye after Georges' death, but in late 1893 she arranged to meet him at the [[mausoleum]] in [[Samois-sur-Seine]] and, next to the coffin, they had [[sexual intercourse]]. Her purpose was to conceive a baby with the same father, to whom the soul of Georges would transmigrate in [[metempsychosis]].&lt;ref name= schofield&gt;{{cite web|last1= Schofield|first1= Hugh |title= Ireland's heroine who had sex in her baby's tomb |URL = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-31064648 |publisher= BBC |accessdate=31 January 2015|date= 31 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In August 1894 Gonne and Millevoye's daughter [[Iseult Gonne |Iseult]] was born. At age 23, Iseult was proposed to by then-52-year-old William Butler Yeats, and she had a brief affair with [[Ezra Pound]].  At age 26, Iseult married the Irish-Australian novelist, [[Francis Stuart]], who was then 18 years old.

During the 1890s Gonne travelled extensively throughout England, [[Wales]], [[Scotland]] and the United States campaigning for the nationalist cause, forming an organization called the "Irish League" (L'association irlandaise) in 1896.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Greene |first1= D.H. |title=J.M. Synge, 1871–1909|date=1959 |publisher= Macmillan|location=New York|page=62 |url= https://archive.org/details/jmsynge1871190900gree |accessdate= 26 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1899 her relationship with Millevoye ended.

Gonne, in opposition to the attempts of the British to gain the loyalty of the young Irish during the early 1900s, was known to hold special receptions for children. She, along with other volunteers, fought to preserve the Irish culture during the period of Britain's colonization, founding [[Inghinidhe na hÉireann]]{{Efn | At Easter 1900.  It translates as Daughters of Erin.  Cross-reference to Daughters of the American Revolution 1776.}}  Twenty-nine women attended the first meeting.  They decided to "combat in every way English influence doing so much injury to the artistic taste and refinement of the Irish people."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Sinead | last = McCoole | title = No Ordinary Women: Irish Female Activists in the Revolutionary Years 1900–23 | publisher = The O'Brien Press Dublin | year = 2004 | pages = 20–1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In her [[autobiography]] she wrote, "I have always hated war and am by nature and philosophy a [[pacifism |pacifist]], but it is the English who are forcing war on us, and the first principle of war is to kill the enemy."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Gonne | first1 = Maud |last2 =Jeffares | first2 = A. Norman | last3 =White | first3 = Anna MacBride | title = The autobiography of Maud Gonne : a servant of the queen | publisher = University of Chicago Press | year = 1995 | location = Chicago | page = 115 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=PyRDfSepAdUC&amp;lpg=PR1&amp;pg=PA115 | isbn = 978-0-226-30252-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Acting==
In 1897, along with Yeats and [[Arthur Griffith]], she organised protests against [[Queen Victoria]]'s [[Diamond Jubilee]].  In April 1902, she took a leading role in Yeats's play ''[[Cathleen Ní Houlihan]]''. She portrayed Cathleen, the "old woman of Ireland," who mourns for her four provinces, lost to the English colonizers.  She was already spending much of her time in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;McCoole, "No Ordinary Women", p.24&lt;/ref&gt;

In the same year, she joined the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. She refused many marriage proposals from Yeats, not only because he was unwilling to convert to Catholicism or because she viewed him as insufficiently radical in his [[Irish nationalist|nationalism]], but also because she believed his unrequited love for her had been a boon for his poetry and that the world should thank her for never having accepted his proposals. When Yeats told her he was not happy without her, she replied,
{{cquote|Oh yes, you are, because you make beautiful poetry out of what you call your unhappiness and are happy in that. Marriage would be such a dull affair. Poets should never marry. The world should thank me for not marrying you.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jeffares|first=A. Norman|title=W. B. Yeats, a new biography|year=1988|publisher=Continuum|location=London and New York|page=102}}&lt;/ref&gt; |100|100|}}

In the 30s she was involved in the [[Friends of Soviet Russia]] organisation.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.ie/books?id=MCJO7AX9tjsC&amp;pg=PA157&amp;lpg=PA157&amp;dq=hanna+sheehy+skeffington+friends+of+soviet+russia&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=KPdwJJpZ9R&amp;sig=38OtsD3yfz-ofB1jU7cPizMftI0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwi74f2srMncAhUBAcAKHeFZBBgQ6AEwAXoECAMQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=hanna%20sheehy%20skeffington%20friends%20of%20soviet%20russia&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marriage==
In Paris in 1903, after having turned down at least four marriage proposals from Yeats between 1891 and 1901, Maud married Major [[John MacBride]], who had led the [[Irish Transvaal Brigade]] against the British in the [[Second Boer War]]. The following year their son [[Seán MacBride]] was born. 
Afterwards Gonne and her husband agreed to end their marriage.  She demanded sole custody of their son, but MacBride refused, and a divorce case began in Paris on 28 February 1905.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ricorso.net/rx/library/criticism/major/Yeats_WB/Jordan_A.htm |author =Anthony J. Jordan|title = The Yeats Gonne MacBride Triangle |publisher=Ricorso.net | |accessdate=2017-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The only charge against MacBride substantiated in court was that he had been drunk on one occasion during the marriage. A divorce was not granted, and MacBride was given the right to visit his son twice weekly.

After the marriage ended, Gonne made allegations of domestic violence and, according to W. B. Yeats, of sexual molestation of Iseult, her daughter from a previous relationship, then aged eleven.&lt;ref&gt;p. 286, Foster, R. F. (1997). W. B. Yeats: A Life, Vol. I: The Apprentice Mage. New York: Oxford UP. {{ISBN|0-19-288085-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some critics have suggested that Yeats may have fabricated his allegations due to his hatred of MacBride over Maud’s rejection of him in favour of MacBride.  Neither the divorce papers submitted by Gonne nor Iseult's own writings mention any such incident, which is unsurprising, given the reticence of the times around such matters, but Frances Stuart, Iseult's later husband, attests to Iseult telling him about it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stuart|first1=Francis|title=Black List, Section H|date=1971|publisher=Southern Illinois University Press|location=Carbondale, IL|isbn=0809305275|page=34|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BFVeAAAAIAAJ&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=John++MacBride|accessdate=20 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The allegation concerning Iseult was made by Maud to Dr. Anthony MacBride, John's brother. Though Maud omitted it from court proceedings, the MacBride side raised it in court to have John's name cleared. As Maud wrote to Yeats, MacBride succeeded in this. Nevertheless, Yeats and some of his biographers still insisted on traducing John MacBride, insisting that Iseult was a victim. Some of them have gone so far as to omit entirely the fact that MacBride raised the matter in Court and was cleared by the Court of this allegation. &lt;ref&gt;''The Yeats Gonne MacBride Triangle'', [[Anthony J. Jordan]]. Westport Books, 2000. pp.&amp;nbsp;86–104&lt;/ref&gt; In 1917 Yeats, in his fifties, proposed to the 23-year-old Iseult, who did not accept.  He had known her since she was four, and often referred to her as his darling child and took a paternal interest in her writings.  Many Dubliners wrongly suspected that Yeats was her father.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://amandafrench.net/amandafrench/files/IseultGonne.pdf|first=Amanda |last=French|title=A Strangely Useless Thing': Iseult Gonne and Yeats|publisher=Yeats Eliot Review: A Journal of Criticism and Scholarship |year=2002|accessdate=11 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MacBride visited his son as allowed for a short time, but returned to Ireland and never saw him again. Gonne raised the boy in Paris. MacBride was executed in May 1916 along with [[James Connolly]] and other leaders of the [[Easter Rising]]. After MacBride's death Gonne felt that she could safely return to live permanently in Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jordan|first=Anthony J.|title=The Yeats-Gonne-MacBride triangle |publisher=Westport|year=2000|pages=?|isbn= 978-0-9524447-4-9|url=https://books.google.ie/books?id=yHhbAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=The+Yeats+Gonne+MacBride+Triangle+by+Anthony+Jordan&amp;dq=The+Yeats+Gonne+MacBride+Triangle+by+Anthony+Jordan|accessdate=14 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yeats proposed to Iseult Gonne once again in 1918, and she considered the proposal.  The three travelled back together to London, from France, where Iseult finally turned him down, because he was not really in love with her and it would upset her mother too much.&lt;ref&gt;Yeat's Ghosts, Brenda Maddox&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Maud Gonne on relief duty in Dublin July 4, 1922.jpg|thumb|Maud Gonne (far right) with relief agency members in Dublin in July 1922]]

===Women's Movement===
Gonne remained very active in Paris.  In 1913, she established ''L'Irlande libre'', a French newspaper.  She wanted Cumann na mBan to be considered seriously: her idea was to get affiliation with the English Red Cross, and wrote to Geneva to gain an international profile for the new nationalist organization.&lt;ref&gt;McCoole, p. 30 cites Barry Delany, 'Cumann na mBan', William Fitzgerald (ed.) "The Voice of Ireland", London, Virtue &amp; Co Ltd, p.162.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1918, she was arrested in Dublin and imprisoned in England for six months.

She worked with the [[Irish White Cross]] for the relief of victims of violence.  Gonne MacBride moved in upper-class circles.  Lord French's sister, Mrs [[Charlotte Despard]] was a famous suffragist, who was already a Sinn Feiner when she arrived in Dublin in 1920.  She naturally accompanied Gonne on a tour of County Cork, seat of the most fervent revolutionary activity.  Cork was under Martial Law Area (MLA) prohibited to Irishmen and women outside the zone.  But the Viceroy's sister had a pass.&lt;ref&gt;Diary of Hanah Moynihan, KGC, Dublin, cited in McCoole, p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1921, she opposed the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty |Treaty]] and advocated the [[Irish republicanism|Republican]] side. The committee that set up White Cross in Ireland asked Gonne to join in January 1921 to distribute funds to victims administered by [[Cumann na mBan]].&lt;ref&gt;Diary of Hannah Moynihan, Autograph Books, Kilmainham Gaol Collection, Dublin.&lt;/ref&gt;  She settled in Dublin in 1922.  During the street battles she headed up a delegation called [[The Women's Peace Committee]] which approached the Dáil leadership, and her old friend [[Arthur Griffith]].  But they were unable to stop the indiscriminate shooting of civilians, being more interested in law and order.  In August she set up a similar organization, the Women's Prisoner's Defence League.  The prisons were brutal and many women were locked up in men's prisons.  The League supported families wanting news of inmates.  They worked for prisoners rights, began vigils, and published stories of tragic deaths.  Through her friendship with Despard and opposition to government they were labeled "Mad and Madame Desperate".&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Mullvihill, "Charlotte Despard", pp. 143–45, cited by McCoole, p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt; Historians have related the extent of the damage done to her home at 75 St Stephen's Green, when soldiers of the Free State Army ransacked the place.  Maud was arrested and taken to Mountjoy Jail.  On 9 November 1922 the Sinn Féin Office was raided in Suffolk street; the Free State had swept the capital, rounding up opposition committing them to prison for internment.  The evidence comes from Margaret Buckley, who as Secretary of Sinn Féin acted as legal representative for the ladies.  But there was nothing prudish about their concerted opposition to civil rights abuses.

On 10 April 1923, Maud Gonne MacBride was arrested. The charges were: 1) painting banners for seditious demonstrations, and 2) preparing anti-government literature. According to the diary account of her colleague Hannah Moynihan: &lt;blockquote&gt;Last night [10th April] at 11pm, we heard the commotion which usually accompanies the arrival of new prisoners... we pestered the wardress and she told us there were four – Maud Gonne MacBride, her daughter Mrs Iseult Stuart and two lesser lights...  Early this morning... we could see Maud walking majestically past our cell door leading on a leash a funny little lap dog which answered to the name that sounded like Wuzzo - Wuzzo.&lt;ref&gt;Diary of Hannah Moynihan, KGC, Dublin, as cited by McCoole, pp. 118–19.&lt;/ref&gt;  &lt;/blockquote&gt;  She was released on 28 April, after twenty days in custody.  Months later the women spread a rumour that Nell Ryan had died in custody in order to gain a propaganda victory.&lt;ref&gt;Nellie O'Cleirigh, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; Women continued to be arrested.  On 1 June Maud was standing in protest outside Kilmainham Jail with Dorothy Macardle, the writer and activist, and Iseult Stuart.  They were supporting hungerstriker Maire Comerford.  Again the source for this story seems to be fellow ex-prisoner Hanna Moynihan.&lt;ref&gt;McCoole, p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Yeats's muse==
[[File:Maud Gonne's headstone.jpg|thumb|Maud Gonne's gravestone, [[Glasnevin Cemetery]], Dublin.&lt;br&gt;May 2015]]

Many of Yeats's poems are inspired by her, or mention her, such as "This, This Rude Knocking."&lt;ref name=EG&gt;{{cite web|title=Monologue about Yeats and his muse set to open at Epsom Playhouse |url=http://www.epsomguardian.co.uk/news/9904938.Monologue_about_Yeats__and_his_muse_set_to_open_at_playhouse/ |publisher=Epsom Guardian |accessdate=31 January 2015 |date=4 September 2012 |quote=Many of Yeats's poems are inspired by her, or mention her, such as "This, This Rude Knocking".

&lt;blockquote&gt;I have spread my dreams under your feet; &lt;br&gt; Tread softly because you tread on my dreams.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Few poets have celebrated a woman's beauty to the extent Yeats did in his lyric verse about Gonne. From his second book to ''Last Poems'', she became [[Roman de la Rose|the Rose]], [[Helen of Troy]] (in ''No second Troy''), the [[Leda and the Swan|Ledaean Body]] ("Leda and the Swan" and "Among School Children"), ''[[Cathleen Ní Houlihan]]'', [[Pallas Athene]] and [[Deirdre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Pratt |first=Linda Ray |title=Maud Gonne: "Strange Harmonies Amid Discord"|journal=Biography, University of Hawai'i Press |volume=6 |issue=3 |pages=189–208|jstor=23539184 |date=Summer 1983 |registration=yes  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Why should I blame her that she filled my days &lt;br&gt; With misery, or that she {{not a typo|woul|d of}} late &lt;br&gt; Have taught to ignorant men most violent ways &lt;br&gt; Or hurled the little streets upon the great. &lt;br&gt; (from 'No second Troy', 1916)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Yeats's 1893 poem "On a Child's Death" is thought to have been inspired by the death of Gonne's son Georges, whom Yeats thought Gonne had [[adoption|adopted]]. The poem was not published in Yeats's lifetime; scholars say he did not want the poem to be part of his canon, as it is of uneven quality.&lt;ref name=schofield/&gt;

==Autobiography==
Maud Gonne MacBride published her autobiography in 1938, titled ''A Servant of the Queen'', a reference to both a vision she had of the Irish queen of old, Cathleen (or Caitlin) Ní Houlihan and an ironic title considering Gonne's Irish Nationalism and rejection of the British monarchy.

Her son, [[Seán MacBride]], was active in politics in Ireland and in the [[United Nations]].  He was a founding member of [[Amnesty International]] and its Chairman, and he was awarded the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 1974.

She died in [[Clonskeagh]], aged 86 and is buried in [[Glasnevin Cemetery]], Dublin.

The '''''Mouzi Lihoulun''''' ({{zh|s=牟子理惑论|t=牟子理惑論|p= Móuzǐ lǐhuòlùn |w=Mou-tzu Li-huo-lün|l=Master Mou's Treatise Settling Doubts}}) is a classic [[Chinese Buddhist]] text. It comprises a purportedly autobiographical preface by Master Mou, a late 2nd-century Confucian [[scholar-official]] who converted to Buddhism, and an imaginary dialogue of questions and answers about Buddhist practices.

==Title==
The ''Mouzi lihuolun'' is known under several names, including the abbreviated title  ''Mouzi''.

''Mouzi'' compounds the uncommon [[Chinese surname]] Mou [[wikt:牟|牟]] "seek; obtain" with the suffix ''-zi'' [[wikt:子|子]] "Master" (compare [[Laozi]]). The Japanese title ''Bōshi riwakuron'' 牟氏理惑論 (Chinese ''Moushi lihuolun'') replaces ''shi'' (''zi'') "Master" with ''shi'' (''shi'') [[wikt:氏|氏]] "Mister; a certain person." 
''Lihuolun'' combines ''li'' [[wikt:理|理]] "manage; put in order; acknowledge"; ''huo'' [[wikt:惑|惑]] "confusion; delusion; doubt; suspicion"; and ''lun'' [[wikt:論|論]] "discourse; opinion; dissertation; essay."

According to Yu Jiaxi 余嘉錫 (Zürcher 2007:13), the original title ''Mouzi jihuolun'' 牟子治惑論 – with ''zhi'' [[wikt:治|治]] "rule; research; manage; cure; eliminate" instead of ''li'' – was changed to avoid the [[naming taboo]] on [[Emperor Gaozong of Tang]]'s personal name Zhi 治.

English translations of ''Mouzi lihuolun'' include:
*"Mou-tzu on the Settling of Doubts" (Ch'en 1972, Biernatzki 1991)
*"Mou-tzu's Treatise on the Removal of Doubt" or "…Elimination of Delusion" (Keenan 1994)
*"Master Mou’s Treatise for the Removal of Doubts" (Campany 2003)
*"Mouzi's Correction of Errors" (Despeux 2008)
Some renditions of shortened ''Lihuolun'' are:
*"Disposing of Error" (De Bary 1999)
*"Dispelling Doubts" (Chan and Lo 2010)
*"The Removal of Doubts" (Lagerway 2010)

==Content==
The received ''Mouzi Lihuolun'' text contains a supposedly autobiographical Introduction, thirty-seven articles of Dialogue between Mouzi and an unnamed Chinese critic (or critics) questioning Buddhist practices, and a Postscript in which the critic converts to Buddhism.

The Introduction identifies the author as an [[Eastern Han Dynasty]] Confucian scholar who is not mentioned in any Han-era historical records.  (Later editions give the name of Mou Rong 牟融.Compare the [[Tang Dynasty]] scholar also named [[Mou Rong (Tang Dynasty)|Mou Rong]] 牟融.) After the death of [[Emperor Ling of Han]] in 189 CE, scholars, especially specialists of immortality fled the chaotic [[Yellow Turban Rebellion]] and moved  to the extreme south of the empire, where Mouzi argued with them. Although very admirative of the Laozi, Mouzi, as he appears in the autobiographical introduction, was very hostile to immortality practices. He himself was born in [[Cangwu County|Cangwu]] in [[Jiaozhou (region)|Jiaozhou]] (present day [[Tonkin]]), where he studied the Confucian Classics, the Laozi and Buddhism. 

The 37 ''Mouzi'' Dialogues treat early Chinese objections to Buddhism, such as coming from a foreign [[Barbarian#Chinese culture|"barbarian"]] culture, not being mentioned in the [[Chinese classics]], and the doctrine of [[Rebirth (Buddhism)|reincarnation]] negating Daoist [[Xian (Taoism)|"immortality"]].

Haircutting exemplified Chinese/Buddhist cultural problems. [[Tonsure#Buddhism|Buddhist tonsure]] required monks to shave their heads – but Confucian [[filial piety]] prohibited Chinese adults from cutting their hair (because it was ultimately a gift from one's parents). In Article 9, "Filial Piety and Buddhist Practice", the interlocutor quotes the ''[[Classic of Filial Piety]]'', as does Master Mou along with the ''[[Analects]]''.
&lt;blockquote&gt;The questioner said, "The ''Classic of Filiality'' says, 'Our body, limbs, hair, and skin  are all  received from our fathers and mothers. We dare not injure them.' When [[Zengzi]]  was about to die, he bared his hands and feet [to show them intact from harm]. But now the monks shave their heads. How this violates the sayings of the sages and is out of keeping with the way of the filial! …"&lt;br&gt; 
Mouzi  said, … "Confucius has said, 'There are those with  whom one can  pursue the Way …  but with  whom one cannot weigh  [decisions].' This is what is meant by doing what is best at the time. Furthermore, the ''Classic of Filiality'' says, 'The early kings ruled by surpassing virtue and the essential  Way.' [[Wu Taibo|Taibo]] cut his hair short and tattooed his body, thus following of his own  accord the [foreign] customs of Wu and Yue and going against the spirit of the 'body, limbs, hair, and skin' passage. And yet Confucius praised him, saying that his might well  be called the ultimate virtue." (tr. De Bary 1999:422)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The ''Mouzi'' text frequently explains Buddhism in Daoist terms; for instance, it calls Buddhism the ''Fodao'' 佛道 "Buddha Dao". Keenan (1994:150) said the author's rhetorical strategy was "to graft the new branch of the Buddha Tao onto the trunk of classical Chinese culture, which is represented for him by the Confucian classics and the works of classical Taoism." To Mouzi, Daoism included the philosophical ''[[Daodejing]]'' and ''[[Zhuangzi (book)|Zhuangzi]]'' but excluded [[Xuanxue]] "Neo-Daoism" and ''[[Xian (Taoism)|xian]]'' "transcendent; immortal" practices. For example, Article 30, "Fasting: Buddhist and Daoist", dismisses ''[[Bigu (avoiding grains)|bigu]]'' 辟穀 "abstention from grains (in order to gain immortality)" (see Despeux 2008).
&lt;blockquote&gt;A critic asked: Among the Taoists, some abstain from eating grain, yet they drink their wine and eat their meat. They claim that this is the method of Lao-tzu. But the Buddha Tao considers wine and meat to be absolutely prohibited, while it does allow one to eat grain. Why such a stark difference?&lt;br&gt;
Mou-tzu said: Such doctrines are trivial and trifling. None of their ninety-six teachings surpasses the Buddha in tranquility and nonaction. I have inspected the two sections of the Lao Tzu and have heard of his prohibition against the five tastes, but I have never found any place where he says that we should stop eating the five grains. The sage [i.e., Confucius] has arranged the text of the Seven Classics, but they contain no method of abstaining from grains. Lao wrote the Five Thousand Words but there is no mention of avoiding grains. The sage says, "Those who eat grain are wise; those who eat grasses are fools. Those who eat meat are violent. Those who feed on the air are long-lived." (tr. Keenan 1994:151) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
"Ninety-six teachings" refers to the Buddhist [[Anguttara Nikaya]]'s reckoning of heterodox teachings (Keenan 1994:148). The [[Five Cereals (China)|Five Grains]] and [[Chinese_herbology#Five_Flavors|Five Tastes]] are aspects of [[Wu Xing|Wuxing]] "Five Phases" theory.

In the Postscript ("The Thirty-seven Factors"), the interlocutory critic decides to take Buddhist lay vows because Mouzi's answers had resolved all doubts. The Postscript relates the 37 ''Mouzi'' articles with the 37 Buddhist [[Bodhipakkhiyādhammā]] factors of enlightenment and Daoist chapters 1-37 of the ''[[Daodejing]]'' (known as the ''Daojing'' section).
&lt;blockquote&gt;A critic asked: Your understanding is truly comprehensive, and assuredly we have never heard the like. But why do you limit yourself to these thirty-seven articIes? Do you have a model? &lt;br&gt;
Mou-tzu said: Tumbleweeds drifted about and cartwheels were invented. Hollow wood floated and boats and oars were made. A spider spun his web and fine nets were woven. Bird prints were seen and written words were devised. Thus it is easy to complete a task with a model but difficult to do so without one. I have examined how the essence of the Buddha's scriptures have thirty-seven factors of awakening and how Lao-tzu's classic on the Tao also has thirty-seven chapters. These are my models.&lt;br&gt;
When the doubters heard this, they became nervously deferential, paled, clasped their hands together, and backed away from their mats. Shrinking back in humility and prostrating themselves, they said, "We are really backward and blind persons, born into a benighted backwater. We have presumed to utter foolish words and have not distinguished happiness from sorrow. But now, upon hearing your pronouncements, as suddenly as hot water melts the snow, we beg to change our feelings, cleanse our minds, and reform ourselves. May we please receive the five precepts and become lay followers?" (tr. Keenan 1994:174-175) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[Upāsaka and Upāsikā]] male and female Buddhist lay devotees take vows to follow the [[Five Precepts]] code of ethics.

==History==
Scholars disagree over the historicity of Mouzi and the ''Lihuolun''. According to the Dutch sinologist [[Erik Zürcher]] (2007:13), "The early history of the text (if it had one) is wholly obscure; the treatise is neither mentioned nor quoted anywhere before the second half of the fifth century." See Keenan (1994:3-7) and Zürcher (2007:13-15) for historical details.

The earliest catalog of Buddhist literature, [[Dao An]]'s (374) ''Zongli zhongjing mulu'' 總理眾經目錄 "Bibliographical Catalog Comprehensively Arranging the Sutra", does not mention the ''Mouzi Lihuolun''. It was first recorded in the (c. 465) ''Falun'' 法論 "Dharma Discourse", Lu Cheng 陸澄's collection of Buddhist literature compiled for the devout [[Emperor Ming of Liu Song]]. Although the ''Falun'' is lost, its table of contents is included in [[Sengyou]]'s (515) ''Chu sanzang jiji'' 出三藏記集 "Collection of Records on the Translated Tripitaka". Sengyou also edited the (517) ''Hongmingji'' 弘明集 "Collection Aggrandizing and Clarifying [Buddhism]" (Link 1960:28), which is the earliest source for the transmitted ''Mouzi'' text. Another early ''Mouzi Lihouhun'' reference is found in the ''[[Shishuo Xinyu]]'' commentary by Liu Chun 劉峻 (426-521). The text was later canonized as part of the [[Chinese Buddhist Canon]].

Scholars  have expressed diverse opinions about the ''Mouzi lihuolun'' date of composition (Lagerway 2010:1138).

Many considered the text authentic and accepted that Mouzi composed it sometime between the final years of the [[Eastern Han Dynasty|Later Han Dynasty]] (25-220 CE) and the middle of the [[Three Kingdoms]] period (220-280). They include eminent scholars such as [[Sun Yirang]], [[Hu Shih]], [[Paul Pelliot]], and [[Henri Maspero]]. Maspero dated the ''Mouzi'' from around 250 because its story of the Buddha’s life (Article 1) was probably copied from that of [[Zhi Qian]]'s (c. 229) ''Taizi ruiying benqi jing'' 太子瑞應本起經 translation. The Japanese scholar Fukui Kōjun 福井康順 (1898–1991) reexamined these various theories and concluded that the ''Mouzi lihuolun'' text was written around the middle of the 3rd century.

Other scholars have rejected the ''Mouzi'' as a spurious work that was falsely attributed to Mouzi. Hu Yinglin 胡應麟 (1551–1602) was first to deny the textual authenticity, and suggested that a scholar forged it during the [[Six Dynasties]] period (222-589). [[Liang Qichao]] considered it a falsification dating from the [[Jin Dynasty (265–420)|Eastern Jin Dynasty]] (317-420) or [[Liu-Song Dynasty|Liu Song Dynasty]] (420–479). 
The Japanese Buddhologist Tokiwa Daijō 常盤大定 (1929–1945) argued that the text was concocted by the monk Huitong 慧通 (c. 426-c. 478), who is mentioned in Gu Huan 顧歡's ''Yixia lun'' 夷夏論 Daoist criticism of Buddhism. Tokiwa believed that Huitong  or another later author created "Mozi" as an imaginary figure with a historical background linking him with some events and personalities known from other sources. Zürcher (2007:15) supported Tokiwa's argument by pointing out that the Preface's tone was too eulogistic to be autobiographical. "Who could believe that a Chinese scholar would … claim that he 'has a complete understanding of civil as well as military affairs, and the talent to react independently (to any situation)'?" He concluded that the Preface is "an idealized description of the scholar-official who leads a retired life far from the bustle of the world."

Most Chinese and foreign academics have interpreted the ''Mouzi lihuolun'' as an early Chinese Buddhist [[apologetic]], for instance Maspero (1981:406) called Mouzi the "first apologist for Buddhism." Keenan controverted this apologistic assumption because the text focuses more upon reinterpreting Chinese traditions than upon defending Buddhist teachings.
&lt;blockquote&gt;The argument is not over Buddhism itself, but over the validity of a Buddhist interpretation of the Chinese classics. The ''Li-huo lun'' is not, then, a Buddhist apologetic arguing for the doctrinal truth of Buddhism over against the Chinese traditions, but rather a culturally Chinese hermeneutic about how to interpret China's classical tradition, about the validity of a Buddhist hermeneutic of its classics. It is hermeneutics, not apologetics. (Keenan 1994:9-10) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Chan and Lo (2010:338) noted the treatise's ultimate reason for adhering to Buddhism "lies in a deliberate calculation of moral reward, rather than a genuine faith in Buddhist dharma per se."

Western language translations of the ''Mouzi lihuolun'' include French by Paul Pelliot (1920) and English by John P. Keenan (1994), who employed [[reader-response criticism]].

==Murder, investigation, and trial==
In 1980 Robinson was the [[chaplain]] at Toledo Mercy Hospital, Toledo, Ohio, United States, where he ministered to the sick and terminally ill. Sister Margaret Ann was the caretaker of the chapel.

Robinson was convicted of strangling and stabbing Pahl, who was 71 at the time, in the [[sacristy]] of a chapel of the hospital where they worked together. The priest presided at her funeral Mass four days after her death. Pahl was stabbed 31 times, including nine times in the shape of an inverted cross. Prosecutors considered this shape was deliberate and intended to humiliate Pahl in death. Pahl was found covered in an altar cloth, her clothes and body arranged to suggest she had been sexually assaulted, although it was not clear she had been.

Robinson was questioned about the crime in 1980, but was not charged. Dean Mandros, the chief of the criminal division in the Lucas County prosecutor's office said as the priest was being questioned by detectives two weeks after the killing, Deputy Police Chief Ray Vetter, who later testified he was a practicing Catholic, interrupted the interview (which is not normal procedure) and allowed a [[monsignor]] to escort Father Robinson out of Police Headquarters, which "upset the detectives to no end". Mandros also said Vetter asked detectives to give him their reports on the case, and some of those reports were never seen again. A [[cover-up]] was [[Allegation|alleged]].&lt;ref name=nytimes&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/12/us/12priest.html "Priest Found Guilty of Nun's 1980 Murder"], ''New York Times'', 12 May 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=yonke/&gt;

The case remained unsolved, with no new leads, until 2003 when police received a letter from a woman who claimed that Robinson had sexually abused her when she was a child in a series of [[Satanic ritual abuse]] that also involved human sacrifice.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,195150,00.html Fast Facts: Timeline of Sister Margaret Ann Pahl's Killing]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/12739830/ Priest convicted of slaying nun]&lt;/ref&gt; The woman, using the name "Survivor Doe", also filed a civil lawsuit against Robinson seeking financial [[damages]] for having been a victim of ritual abuse by Robinson and other adults dressed as nuns.&lt;ref name=yonke/&gt; The case was dismissed in 2011 due to having been filed too late.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dispatch.com/live/content/local_news/stories/2011/04/07/ohio-supreme-court-toledo-priest-dismiss-satanic-abuse.html?sid=101 Supreme Court Rejects Woman's Lawsuit Claiming Satanic Abuse by Toledo Priest, David Yonke, Columbus Dispatch, 7 April 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

The accusations were sent to the prosecutor's cold case unit. Forensic tests indicated a sword-shaped [[letter opener]] that had been found in Robinson's apartment and stored without detailed examination was consistent with the weapon that inflicted the wounds; in the words of the prosecutor's expert, it could "not be ruled out". The tip of the opener fitted a wound in the jaw of the nun's exhumed body "like a key in a lock" according to prosecutors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/12424999/ msnbc: Prosecutor: Priest’s blade fits nun’s wounds, 21 April 206]&lt;/ref&gt;

Prosecutors also found three witnesses who said they had seen the priest near the chapel around the time of the killing. The case against Robinson went to trial on April 24, 2006. He was found guilty on all counts on May 11, 2006. This was the second conviction for homicide of a Catholic priest in the [[United States]]; [[Hans Schmidt (priest)|Hans Schmidt]], executed in 1916, was the first.

On July 11, 2008, Ohio's Sixth District Court of Appeals reaffirmed his conviction,&lt;ref&gt;[http://toledoblade.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080712/NEWS10/428425909/0/NEWS13 The Toledo Blade on the reaffirmation of the conviction]&lt;/ref&gt; and in December 2008 the Ohio Supreme Court declined to hear his appeal. In April 2012 he again applied for his conviction to be quashed,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.toledoblade.com/Courts/2012/04/24/Priest-again-appeals-murder-conviction.html Priest again appeals murder conviction - Withholding of key documents alleged , BY DAVID YONKE, Toledo Blade, 24 April 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; but in February 2013 the Ohio 6th District Court of Appeals confirmed the denial of Robinson’s petition for post-conviction relief.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.toledoblade.com/Courts/2013/02/21/Robinson-s-defense-says-it-will-continue-appeals-despite-priest-s-1980-murder-conviction-being-upheld.html/ Toledo Blade: Priest's conviction in '80 murder upheld – Robinson's defense says it will continue appeals, 21 February 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; Robinson's attorney said the decision would shortly be appealed to the Ohio Supreme Court, and once state appeals were exhausted, the case could move to U.S. District Court. On July 4, 2014, Robinson died in prison, after a judge refused a request for him to be released to Toledo to die.&lt;ref name=death/&gt;

The case is described in the book ''Sin, Shame, And Secrets: The Murder of a Nun, the Conviction of a Priest, and Cover-up in the Catholic Church'' by Toledo journalist David Yonke.&lt;ref name=yonke&gt;''Sin, Shame, And Secrets: The Murder of a Nun, the Conviction of a Priest, and Cover-up in the Catholic Church'' by David Yonke, published by [[Continuum International Publishing Group|Continuum]], 2006, 240pp, {{ISBN|978-0826417558}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=mQ-l9bqL6AIC&amp;pg=PA138&amp;lpg=PA138&amp;dq=yonke+pahl+robinson&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ds1NRPyN_P&amp;sig=KrCOzpfflJ_mJuCq1wHTVTzuHhk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=2KQsUNPQIoO40QWx5IHIDA&amp;ved=0CFYQ6AEwCTgK#v=onepage&amp;q=yonke%20pahl%20robinson&amp;f=false Google books excerpt]&lt;/ref&gt;

The case was also re-examined in the A&amp;E television show ''Dead Again'' where the original verdict was found to be consistent with the findings although one investigator did conclude there appeared to be enough uncertainty to not validate a verdict.

Robinson died on July 4, 2014, at the [[Columbus, Ohio]], hospice unit of Franklin Medical Center, a prison operated by the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Corrections, after a heart attack in May.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/05/us/gerald-robinson-priest-convicted-of-killing-ohio-nun-dies-at-76.html?ref=obituaries&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Peter Seeger''' (May 3, 1919&amp;nbsp;– January 27, 2014) was an American folk singer and [[social activist]]. A fixture on nationwide radio in the 1940s, he also had a string of hit records during the early 1950s as a member of [[the Weavers]], most notably their recording of [[Lead Belly]]'s "[[Goodnight, Irene]]", which topped the charts for 13 weeks in 1950. Members of the Weavers were [[blacklist]]ed during the [[McCarthyism|McCarthy Era]]. In the 1960s, Seeger re-emerged on the public scene as a prominent singer of [[protest song|protest music]] in support of [[nuclear disarmament|international disarmament]], [[civil rights]], [[Counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]], and [[environmentalism|environmental causes]].

A prolific songwriter, his best-known songs include "[[Where Have All the Flowers Gone?]]" (with [[Joe Hickerson]]), "[[If I Had a Hammer|If I Had a Hammer (The Hammer Song)]]" (with [[Lee Hays]] of the Weavers), and "[[Turn! Turn! Turn! (song)|Turn! Turn! Turn!]]", which have been recorded by many artists both in and outside the folk revival movement and are sung throughout the world. "Flowers" was a hit recording for [[the Kingston Trio]] (1962); [[Marlene Dietrich]], who recorded it in English, German and French (1962); and [[Johnny Rivers]] (1965). "If I Had a Hammer" was a hit for [[Peter, Paul and Mary]] (1962) and [[Trini Lopez]] (1963) while [[the Byrds]] had a number one hit with "Turn! Turn! Turn!" in 1965.

Seeger was one of the folk singers responsible for popularizing the [[Spiritual (music)|spiritual]] "[[We Shall Overcome]]" (also recorded by [[Joan Baez]] and many other singer-activists) that became the acknowledged anthem of the [[Civil Rights Movement]], soon after folk singer and activist [[Guy Carawan]] introduced it at the founding meeting of the [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]] (SNCC) in 1960. In the [[PBS]] ''[[American Masters]]'' episode "[[Pete Seeger: The Power of Song]]", Seeger said it was he who changed the lyric from the traditional "We will overcome" to the more singable "We shall overcome".

==Family and personal life==
Seeger was born on May 3, 1919, at the [[French Hospital (Manhattan)|French Hospital]], Midtown Manhattan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/peter-dreier/honor-pete-seeger_b_1883818.html | title=Honor Pete Seeger | work=[[The Huffington Post]] | date=September 14, 2013 | accessdate=July 13, 2013 | author=Clapp, E.P.}}&lt;/ref&gt; His Yankee-Protestant{{clarify|date=June 2017 &lt;!--what exactly is a "yankee-protestant"?--&gt;}} family, which Seeger called "enormously Christian, in the [[Puritan]], [[Calvinist]] New England tradition",&lt;ref&gt;[[David King Dunaway]], ''How Can I Keep From Singing'' (New York: [Random House, 1981, 1990], revised edition, Villard Books, 2008), p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; traced its genealogy back over 200 years. A paternal ancestor, Karl Ludwig Seeger, a doctor from [[Kingdom of Württemberg|Württemberg]], Germany, had emigrated to America during the [[American Revolution]] and married into the old New England family of Parsons in the 1780s.&lt;ref&gt;See [https://books.google.com/books?id=LRP0Q7LJU_IC&amp;pg=PA5&amp;dq=Ann+M.+Pescatello+great-grandfather+Karl+Ludwig+Seeger&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=LZ5iT-uyKuLw0gGH4tCqCA&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Ann M. Pescatello, ''Charles Seeger: A Life in American Music'' (University of Pittsburgh, 1992), pp. 4–5.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Seeger's father, the [[Harvard]]-trained composer and musicologist&lt;ref name=pc1/&gt; [[Charles Seeger|Charles Louis Seeger, Jr.]], was born in Mexico City, Mexico, to American parents. Charles established the first musicology curriculum in the U.S. at the University of California in 1913, helped found the [[American Musicological Society]], and was a key founder of the academic discipline of [[ethnomusicology]]. Pete's mother, Constance de Clyver (née Edson),{{Clarify|date=July 2016|reason=Why changed surname, but not to husband's?}} raised in [[Tunisia]] and trained at the [[Paris Conservatory of Music]], was a concert violinist and later a teacher at the [[Juilliard School]].&lt;ref name=d20&gt;Dunaway (2008), p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Professor Charles Louis Seeger, his wife Constance, and their sons, 23 May 1921.jpg|400px|thumb|Peter Seeger (on father's lap) with his father and mother, Charles and Constance Seeger and brothers on a camping trip (23 May 1921).]]
In 1912, his father Charles Seeger was hired to establish the music department at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], but was forced to resign in 1918 because of his outspoken [[pacifism]] during [[World War I]].&lt;ref&gt;According to Dunaway, the British-born president of the university "all but fired" Charles Seeger (''How Can I Keep From Singing'', p. 26).&lt;/ref&gt; Charles and Constance moved back east, making Charles' parents' estate in [[Patterson, New York]], northeast of New York City, their base of operations. When baby Pete was eighteen months old, they set out with him and his two older brothers in a homemade trailer to bring musical uplift to the working people in the American South.&lt;ref&gt;Ann Pescatello, ''Charles Seeger: A Life In Music'', 83–85.&lt;/ref&gt; Upon their return, Constance taught violin and Charles taught composition at the New York [[Institute of Musical Art]] (later [[Juilliard School|Juilliard]]), whose president, family friend [[Frank Damrosch]], was Constance's adoptive "uncle". Charles also taught part-time at the [[New School for Social Research]]. Career and money tensions led to quarrels and reconciliations, but when Charles discovered Constance had opened a secret bank account in her own name, they separated, and Charles took custody of their three sons.&lt;ref&gt;Dunaway, ''How Can I Keep From Singing'', p. 32. Frank Damrosch, siding with Constance, fired Charles from Juilliard, see Judith Tick, ''Ruth Crawford Seeger: a Composer's Search for American Music'' (Oxford University Press, 1997), pp. 224–25.&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in 1936, Charles held various administrative positions in the federal government's [[Resettlement Administration|Farm Resettlement program]], the [[Works Projects Administration|WPA]]'s [[Federal Music Project]] (1938–1940) and the wartime [[Pan American Union]]. After [[World War II]], he taught [[ethnomusicology]] at the University of California and [[Yale University]].&lt;ref&gt;Dunaway, ''How Can I Keep From Singing'', pp. 22, 24.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=w4&gt;Winkler (2009), p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Charles and Constance divorced when Pete was seven and in 1932 Charles married his composition student and assistant, [[Ruth Crawford Seeger|Ruth Crawford]], now considered by many to be one of the most important [[Modernism (music)|modernist]] composers of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;See Judith Tick, [https://books.google.com/books/about/Ruth_Crawford_Seeger.html?id=xwLTDOR8LUYC' ''Ruth Crawford Seeger: a Composer's Search for American Music'' (1997).]&lt;/ref&gt; Deeply interested in folk music, Ruth had contributed musical arrangements to [[Carl Sandburg]]'s extremely influential folk song anthology [[Carl Sandburg#Folk music|the ''American Songbag'']] (1927) and later created significant original settings for eight of Sandburg's poems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peggyseeger.com/ruth-crawford-seeger/ruth-crawford-seeger-biography |title=David Lewis, '&amp;#39;Ruth Crawford Seeger Biography in 600 Words'&amp;#39; on website of her daughter, Peggy Seeger |publisher=Peggyseeger.com |date=February 14, 2005 |accessdate=August 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pete's eldest brother, Charles Seeger III, was a radio astronomer, and his next older brother, John Seeger, taught in the 1950s at the [[Dalton School]] in Manhattan and was the principal from 1960 to 1976 at [[Ethical Culture Fieldston School|Fieldston Lower School]] in [[the Bronx]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://peteseegersite.wordpress.com/2010/01/18/john-seeger-dies-at-95/|title=John Seeger Dies at 95|date=January 18, 2010|work=[[WordPress.com]]|accessdate=November 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pete's uncle, [[Alan Seeger]], a noted poet ("I Have a Rendezvous with Death"), had been one of the first American soldiers to be killed in [[World War I]]. All four of Pete's half-siblings from his father's second marriage – Margaret (Peggy), Mike, Barbara, and Penelope (Penny) – became folk singers. [[Peggy Seeger]], a well-known performer in her own right, married British folk singer and activist [[Ewan MacColl]]. [[Mike Seeger]] was a founder of the [[New Lost City Ramblers]], one of whose members, [[John Cohen (musician)|John Cohen]], married Pete's half-sister Penny – also a talented singer who died young. Barbara Seeger joined her siblings in recording folk songs for children. In 1935, Pete attended Camp Rising Sun, an international leadership camp held every summer in upstate New York that influenced his life's work. He visited it most recently in 2012.

In 1943, Pete married [[Toshi Seeger|Toshi Aline Ota]], whom he credited with being the support that helped make the rest of his life possible. The couple remained married until Toshi's death in July 2013.&lt;ref name="wife"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/12/arts/music/toshi-seeger-wife-of-folk-singing-legend-dies-at-91.html?_r=0 | title=Toshi Seeger, Wife of Folk-Singing Legend, Dies at 91 | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=July 12, 2013 | accessdate=July 12, 2013 | author=Martin, Douglas}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their first child, Peter Ōta Seeger, was born in 1944 and died at six months, while Pete was deployed overseas. Pete never saw him.&lt;ref&gt;Dunaway, ''How Can I Keep From Singing'', p. 131.&lt;/ref&gt; They went on to have three more children: Daniel (an accomplished photographer and filmmaker), [[Mika Seeger|Mika]] (a potter and muralist), and Tinya (a potter), as well as grandchildren [[Tao Rodríguez-Seeger]] (a musician), Cassie (an artist), Kitama Cahill-Jackson (a psychotherapist), Moraya (a marriage and family therapist married to the NFL player [[Chris DeGeare]]), Penny, Isabelle, and great-grandchildren Dio and Gabel. Tao, a folk musician in his own right, sings and plays guitar, banjo, and harmonica with [[the Mammals]]. Kitama Jackson is a documentary filmmaker who was associate producer of the [[PBS]] documentary ''[[Pete Seeger: The Power of Song]]''.

When asked by [[Beliefnet]] about his religious or spiritual beliefs, and his definition of God, Seeger replied:

{{Quote|text=Nobody knows for sure. But people undoubtedly get feelings which are not explainable and they feel they're talking to God or they're talking to their parents who are long dead. I feel most spiritual when I'm out in the woods. I feel part of nature. Or looking up at the stars. [I used to say] I was an atheist. Now I say, it's all according to your definition of God. According to my definition of God, I'm not an atheist. Because I think God is everything. Whenever I open my eyes I'm looking at God. Whenever I'm listening to something I'm listening to God. I've had preachers of the gospel, Presbyterians and Methodists, saying, "Pete, I feel that you are a very spiritual person." And maybe I am. I feel strongly that I'm trying to raise people's spirits to get together. […] I tell people I don't think God is an old white man with a long white beard and no navel; nor do I think God is an old black woman with white hair and no navel. But I think God is literally everything, because I don't believe that something can come out of nothing. And so there's always been something. Always is a long time.|&lt;ref&gt;

Seeger lived in [[Beacon, New York]]. He remained engaged politically and maintained an active lifestyle in the [[Hudson Valley]] region of New York throughout his life. He and Toshi purchased their land in 1949 and lived there first in a trailer, then in a log cabin they built themselves.

==Career==
===Early work===
[[File:Pete Seeger-1979.jpg|thumb|Seeger in 1979]]
At four, Seeger was sent away to [[boarding school]] but came home two years later when his parents learned the school had failed to inform them he had contracted [[scarlet fever]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilkinson, "The Protest Singer" (2006) p. 50 and Dunaway, ''How Can I Keep From Singing'', p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; He attended first and second grades in [[Nyack, New York]], where his mother lived, before entering boarding school in [[Ridgefield, Connecticut]].&lt;ref&gt;Alec Wilkinson, ''The Protest Singer: An Intimate Portrait of Pete Seeger'' (New York: Knopf, 2009), p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite being classical musicians, his parents did not press him to play an instrument. On his own, the otherwise bookish and withdrawn boy gravitated to the [[ukulele]], becoming adept at entertaining his classmates with it while laying the basis for his subsequent remarkable audience rapport. At thirteen, Seeger enrolled in the [[Avon Old Farms School]] in [[Avon, Connecticut]], from which he graduated in 1936. He was selected to attend [[Camp Rising Sun (New York)|Camp Rising Sun]], the [[George E. Jonas Foundation]]'s international summer leadership program. During the summer of 1936, while traveling with his father and stepmother, Pete heard the five-string [[banjo]] for the first time at the [[Bascom Lamar Lunsford#The Mountain Dance and Folk Festival|Mountain Dance and Folk Festival]] in western [[North Carolina]] near [[Asheville, North Carolina|Asheville]], organized by local [[folkloristics|folklorist]], lecturer, and traditional music performer [[Bascom Lamar Lunsford]], whom Charles Seeger had hired for [[Resettlement Administration|Farm Resettlement]] music projects.&lt;ref&gt;Dunaway, ''How Can I Keep From Singing'', pp. 48–49.&lt;/ref&gt; The festival took place in a covered baseball field. There the Seegers:

&lt;blockquote&gt;watched square-dance teams from Bear Wallow, Happy Hollow, Cane Creek, Spooks Branch, Cheoah Valley, Bull Creek, and Soco Gap; heard the five-string banjo player [[Samantha Bumgarner]]; and family string bands, including a group of Indians from the Cherokee reservation who played string instruments and sang ballads. They wandered among the crowds who camped out at the edge of the field, hearing music being made there as well. As Lunsford's daughter would later recall, those country people "held the riches that Dad had discovered. They could sing, fiddle, pick the banjos, and guitars with traditional grace and style found nowhere else but deep in the mountains. I can still hear those haunting melodies drift over the ball park."&lt;ref name="Judith Tick p. 239"&gt;Judith Tick, ''Ruth Crawford Seeger'', p. 239.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

For the Seegers, experiencing the beauty of this music firsthand was a "conversion experience". Pete was deeply affected and, after learning basic strokes from Lunsford, spent much of the next four years trying to master the five-string banjo.&lt;ref name="Judith Tick p. 239"/&gt; The teenage Seeger also sometimes accompanied his parents to regular Saturday evening gatherings at the [[Greenwich Village]] loft of painter and art teacher [[Thomas Hart Benton (painter)|Thomas Hart Benton]] and his wife Rita. Benton, a lover of Americana, played [[Cindy (folk song)|"Cindy"]] and "[[Old Joe Clark]]" with his students [[Charles Pollock|Charlie]] and [[Jackson Pollock]]; friends from the [[Old-time music|"hillbilly"]] recording industry; as well as [[avant-garde music|avant-garde]] composers [[Carl Ruggles]] and [[Henry Cowell]]. It was at one of Benton's parties that Pete heard "[[John Henry (folklore)#Music|John Henry]]" for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;Judith Tick, ''Ruth Crawford Seeger'', p. 235. According to John Szwed, Jackson Pollock, later famous for his "drip" paintings, played harmonica, having smashed his violin in frustration, see: ''Alan Lomax: The Man Who Recorded the World'' (Viking, 2010), p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt;

Seeger enrolled at [[Harvard College]] on a partial scholarship, but as he became increasingly involved with politics and folk music, his grades suffered and he lost his scholarship. He dropped out of college in 1938.&lt;ref&gt;According to Wilkinson, "The Protest Singer" (2006), p. 51, after failing one of his winter exams and losing his scholarship.&lt;/ref&gt; He dreamed of a career in journalism and took courses in art, as well. His first musical gig was leading students in folk singing at the [[Dalton School]], where his aunt was principal. He polished his performance skills during a summer stint of touring New York State with The Vagabond Puppeteers (Jerry Oberwager, 22; Mary Wallace, 22; and Harriet Holtzman, 23), a traveling [[puppet theater]] "inspired by rural education campaigns of post-revolutionary Mexico".&lt;ref&gt;Dunaway, ''How Can I Keep From Singing'', pp. 61–63.&lt;/ref&gt; One of their shows coincided with a strike by dairy farmers. The group reprised its act in October in New York City. An article in the October 2, 1939, ''[[Daily Worker]]'' reported on the Puppeteers' six-week tour this way:

{{quote|During the entire trip the group never ate once in a restaurant. They slept out at night under the stars and cooked their own meals in the open, very often they were the guests of farmers. At rural affairs and union meetings, the farm women would bring "suppers" and would vie with each other to see who could feed the troupe most, and after the affair the farmers would have earnest discussions about who would have the honor of taking them home for the night.

"They fed us too well," the girls reported. "And we could live the entire winter just by taking advantage of all the offers to spend a week on the farm.

In the farmers' homes they talked about politics and the farmers' problems, about [[antisemitism]] and Unionism, about war and peace and social security—"and always," the puppeteers report, "the farmers wanted to know what can be done to create a stronger unity between themselves and city workers. They felt the need of this more strongly than ever before, and the support of the CIO in their milk strike has given them a new understanding and a new respect for the power that lies in solidarity. One summer has convinced us that a minimum of organized effort on the part of city organizations—unions, consumers' bodies, the American Labor Party and similar groups—can not only reach the farmers but weld them into a pretty solid front with city folks that will be one of the best guarantees for progress.&lt;ref&gt;Emery, Lawrence, "Interesting Summer: Young Puppeteers in Unique Tour of Rural Areas," quoted on [https://web.archive.org/web/20060919131726/http://www.peteseeger.net/DW10021939.htm Pete Seeger website]&lt;/ref&gt;}} 

That fall Seeger took a job in Washington, D.C., assisting [[Alan Lomax]], a friend of his father's, at the [[Archive of American Folk Song]] of the [[Library of Congress]]. Seeger's job was to help Lomax sift through commercial "[[African American music|race]]" and "[[Old-time music|hillbilly]]" music and select recordings that best represented American folk music, a project funded by the music division of the Pan American Union (later the [[Organization of American States]]), of whose music division his father, Charles Seeger, was head (1938–53).&lt;ref&gt;The resultant 22-page mimeographed "List of American Folk Music on Commercial Recordings", issued in 1940 and mailed by Lomax out to academic folklore scholars, became the basis of [[Harry Everett Smith|Harry Smith's]] celebrated ''[[Anthology of American Folk Music]]'' on [[Folkways Records]]. Seeger also did similar work for Lomax at [[Decca Records|Decca]] in the late 1940s.&lt;/ref&gt; Lomax also encouraged Seeger's folk singing vocation, and Seeger was soon appearing as a regular performer on Alan Lomax and [[Nicholas Ray]]'s weekly [[CBS|Columbia Broadcasting]] show ''Back Where I Come From'' (1940–41) alongside [[Josh White]], [[Burl Ives]], [[Lead Belly]], and [[Woody Guthrie]] (whom he had first met at [[Will Geer]]'s Grapes of Wrath benefit concert for [[migrant workers]] on March 3, 1940). ''Back Where I Come From'' was unique in having a [[Racial integration|racially integrated]] cast, which made news when it performed in March 1941 at a command performance at the [[White House]] organized by [[Eleanor Roosevelt]] called "An Evening of Songs for American Soldiers,"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,851095,00.html Folk Songs in the White House], ''Time'', March 3, 1941&lt;/ref&gt; before an audience that included the [[U.S. Secretary of War|Secretaries of War]], [[U.S. Secretary of the Treasury|Treasury]], and the [[U.S. Secretary of the Navy|Navy]], among other notables. The show was a success but was not picked up by commercial sponsors for nationwide broadcasting because of its integrated cast. During [[World War II|the war]], Seeger also performed on nationwide radio broadcasts by [[Norman Corwin]].

Mrs. Roosevelt is expected to attend at 8:30 p.m."&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In 1949, Seeger worked as the vocal instructor for the progressive [[City and Country School]] in [[Greenwich Village]], New York.

===Early activism===
In 1936, at the age of 17, Pete Seeger joined the [[Young Communist League, USA|Young Communist League]] (YCL), then at the height of its popularity and influence. In 1942, he became a member of the [[Communist Party USA]] (CPUSA) itself but left in 1949.&lt;ref&gt;He later commented "Innocently I became a member of the Communist Party, and when they said fight for peace, I did, and when they said fight Hitler, I did. I got out in '49, though.... I should have left much earlier. It was stupid of me not to. My father had got out in '38, when he read the testimony of the trials in Moscow, and he could tell they were forced confessions. We never talked about it, though, and I didn't examine closely enough what was going on.... I thought Stalin was the brave secretary Stalin, and had no idea how cruel a leader he was." Wilkinson, "The Protest Singer" (2006), p. 52; see also ''The Protest Singer: An Intimate Portrait'' (2009), p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the spring of 1941, the twenty-one-year-old Seeger performed as a member of the [[Almanac Singers]] along with Millard Lampell, [[Cisco Houston]], [[Woody Guthrie]], Butch, and [[Bess Lomax Hawes]], and Lee Hays. Seeger and the Almanacs cut several albums of 78s on Keynote and other labels, ''[[Songs for John Doe]]'' (recorded in late February or March and released in May 1941), the ''[[Talking Union]]'', and an album each of sea chanteys and pioneer songs. Written by Millard Lampell, ''[[Songs for John Doe]]'' was performed by Lampell, Seeger, and Hays, joined by Josh White and Sam Gary. It contained lines such as, "It wouldn't be much thrill to die for Du Pont in Brazil," that were sharply critical of [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Roosevelt]]'s unprecedented peacetime draft (enacted in September 1940). This anti-war/anti-draft tone reflected the Communist Party line after the 1939 [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]], which maintained the war was "phony" and a mere pretext for big American corporations to get Hitler to attack Soviet Russia. Seeger has said he believed this line of argument at the time—as did many fellow members of the Young Communist League (YCL). Though nominally members of the [[Popular Front]], which was allied with Roosevelt and more moderate liberals, the YCL's members still smarted from Roosevelt and [[Winston Churchill|Churchill]]'s arms embargo to Loyalist Spain (which Roosevelt later called a mistake),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xTKvo-cXv3EC&amp;dq=Roosevelt+refusal+to+aid+Loyalist+Spain+mistake&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|first=Robert |last=Dallek

A June 16, 1941, review in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine, which under its owner, [[Henry Luce]], had become very interventionist, denounced the Almanacs' ''John Doe'', accusing it of scrupulously echoing what it called "the mendacious Moscow tune" that "Franklin Roosevelt is leading an unwilling people into a J. P. Morgan war." Eleanor Roosevelt, a fan of folk music, reportedly found the album "in bad taste," though President Roosevelt, when the album was shown to him, merely observed, correctly as it turned out, that few people would ever hear it. More alarmist was the reaction of eminent German-born Harvard Professor of Government [[Carl Joachim Friedrich]], an adviser on domestic propaganda to the United States military. In a review in the June 1941 ''[[Atlantic Monthly]]'', entitled "The Poison in Our System," he pronounced ''Songs for John Doe'' "...strictly subversive and illegal," "...whether Communist or Nazi financed," and "a matter for the attorney general," observing further that "mere" legal "suppression" would not be sufficient to counteract this type of populist poison,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peteseeger.net/poison.htm "The Poison in Our System" (excerpt from the ''Atlantic Monthly'') by Carl Joachim Friedrich] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130603002452/http://www.peteseeger.net/poison.htm |date=June 3, 2013}}. Note: Dunaway misses the significance of military propagandist Carl Joachim Friedrich, when he mistakenly refers to him as "Karl Frederick," an error other writers who relied on Dunaway repeated.&lt;/ref&gt; the poison being folk music and the ease with which it could be spread.&lt;ref&gt;Friedrich's review concluded: "The three records sell for one dollar and you are asked to 'play them in your home, play them in your union hall, take them back to your people.' Probably some of these songs fall under the criminal provisions of the Selective Service Act, and to that extent it is a matter for the Attorney-General. But you never can handle situations of this kind democratically by mere suppression. Unless civic groups and individuals will make a determined effort to counteract such appeals by equally effective methods, democratic morale will decline." Upon United States entry into the war in 1942, Friedrich became chairman of the Executive Committee of the Council for Democracy, charged with combatting isolationism, and had his [http://www.peteseeger.net/poison.htm article on the Almanacs] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130603002452/http://www.peteseeger.net/poison.htm |date=June 3, 2013 }} reprinted as one of several pamphlets which he sent to radio network executives.&lt;/ref&gt;

At that point, the U.S. had not yet entered the war but was energetically re-arming. African Americans were barred from working in defense plants, a situation that greatly angered both African Americans and white progressives. Civil rights leader [[A. J. Muste]] and Black union leaders [[A. Philip Randolph]] and [[Bayard Rustin]] began planning a huge march on Washington to protest racial discrimination in war industries and to urge desegregation of the armed forces. The march, which many regard as the first manifestation of the Civil Rights Movement, was canceled after President Roosevelt issued [[Executive Order 8802]] (The Fair Employment Act) of June 25, 1941, barring discrimination in hiring by companies holding federal contracts for defense work. This Presidential act defused black anger considerably, although the United States Army still refused to desegregate, declining to participate in what it considered social experimentation.&lt;ref&gt;"The Army cannot change civilian ideas on the Negro. The army is not a sociological laboratory. The Army's job is to train soldiers. To address itself to racial problems would be to endanger efficiency and morale," Colonel E.R. Householder speaking to a conference of African-American editors on December 8, 1941, quoted by [[Roy Wilkins]] in [https://books.google.com/books?id=ElsEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA131&amp;lpg=PA131&amp;dq=the+army+is+not+a+sociological+laboratory&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ieTtCOD_DS&amp;sig=1rvq4bu3QrPa13hZmbCK25uttrU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=BhXcVKXNHcygNr_9gKAL&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=the%20army%20is%20not%20a%20sociological%20laboratory&amp;f=false "The Old Army Game?" ''The Crisis'' (December, 1945), pp. 130–31.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Roosevelt's order came three days after Hitler broke the non-aggression pact and invaded the Soviet Union, at which time the Communist Party quickly directed its members to get behind the draft and forbade participation in strikes for the duration of the war (angering some leftists). Copies of ''Songs for John Doe'' were removed from sale, and the remaining inventory destroyed, though a few copies may exist in the hands of private collectors.&lt;ref&gt;Although the Almanacs were accused – both at the time and in subsequent histories – of reversing their attitudes in response to the Communist Party's new party line, "Seeger has pointed out that virtually all progressives reversed course and supported the war. He insists that no one, Communist Party or otherwise, told the Almanacs to change their songs. (Seeger interview with [Richard A.] Reuss 4/9/68)" quoted in William G. Roy, [http://www.allacademic.com//meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/1/0/8/1/2/pages108124/p108124-1.php "Who Shall Not Be Moved? Folk Music, Community and Race in the American The Communist Party and the Highlander School," ff p. 16]. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090302214224/http://www.allacademic.com//meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/1/0/8/1/2/pages108124/p108124-1.php |date=March 2, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Almanac Singers' ''Talking Union'' album, on the other hand, was reissued as an LP by [[Folkways Records|Folkways]] (FH 5285A) in 1955 and is still available. The following year, the Almanacs issued ''[[Dear Mr. President (Almanac Singers album)|Dear Mr. President]]'', an album in support of Roosevelt and the war effort. The title song, "Dear Mr. President", was a solo by Pete Seeger, and its lines expressed his lifelong credo:

{{quote|Now, Mr. President, / We haven't always agreed in the past, I know, / But that ain't at all important now. / What is important is what we got to do, / We got to lick Mr. Hitler, and until we do, / Other things can wait.//

Now, as I think of our great land . . . / I know it ain't perfect, but it will be someday, / Just give us a little time. // This is the reason that I want to fight, / Not 'cause everything's perfect, or everything's right. / No, it's just the opposite: I'm fightin' because / I want a better America, and better laws, / And better homes, and jobs, and schools, / And no more Jim Crow, and no more rules like / "You can't ride on this train 'cause you're a Negro," / "You can't live here 'cause you're a Jew,"/ "You can't work here 'cause you're a union man."//

So, Mr. President, / We got this one big job to do / That's lick Mr. Hitler and when we're through, / Let no one else ever take his place / To trample down the human race. / So what I want is you to give me a gun / So we can hurry up and get the job done.}}

Seeger's critics, however, continued to bring up the Almanacs' repudiated ''Songs for John Doe''. In 1942, a year after the ''John Doe'' album's brief appearance (and disappearance), the FBI decided that the now-pro-war Almanacs were still endangering the war effort by subverting recruitment. According to the New York ''World Telegram'' (February 14, 1942), Carl Friedrich's 1941 article "The Poison in Our System" was printed up as a pamphlet and distributed by the Council for Democracy (an organization that Friedrich and [[Henry Luce]]'s right-hand man, [[C. D. Jackson]], Vice President of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine, had founded "...to combat all the nazi, fascist, communist, pacifist..." antiwar groups in the United States).&lt;ref&gt;Blanche Wiessen Cook, ''Eisenhower Declassified'' (Doubleday, 1981), page 122. "The Council was a limited affair," Cook writes, "...that served mostly to highlight Jackson's talents as a propagandist."&lt;/ref&gt;

Seeger served in the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] in the [[Pacific Ocean theater of World War II|Pacific]]. He was trained as an airplane mechanic but was reassigned to entertain the American troops with music. Later, when people asked him what he did in the war, he always answered: "I strummed my banjo." After returning from service, Seeger and others established [[People's Songs]], conceived as a nationwide organization with branches on both coasts and designed to "Create, promote and distribute songs of labor and the American People"&lt;ref&gt;People's Songs Inc. People's Songs Newsletter No 1. February 1946. [[Old Town School of Folk Music]] Resource center collection.&lt;/ref&gt; With Pete Seeger as its director, People's Songs worked for the 1948 presidential campaign of Roosevelt's former Secretary of Agriculture and Vice President, [[Henry A. Wallace]], who ran as a third-party candidate on the [[Progressive Party (United States, 1948)|Progressive Party]] ticket. Despite having attracted enormous crowds nationwide, however, Wallace won only in New York City and following the election he was excoriated for accepting the help in his campaign of Communists and fellow travelers such as Seeger and singer [[Paul Robeson]].&lt;ref&gt;American Masters: "Pete Seeger: The Power of Song – [[KQED (TV)|KQED]] Broadcast 2-27-08.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spanish Civil War songs===
Seeger had been a fervent supporter of the Republican forces in the [[Spanish Civil War]]. In 1943, with [[Tom Glazer]] and Bess and Baldwin Hawes, he recorded an album of 78s called ''[[Songs of the Lincoln Battalion]]'' on Moe Asch's Stinson label. This included such songs as "[[There's a Valley in Spain called Jarama]]" and "[[¡Ay Carmela! (song)|Viva la Quince Brigada]]". In 1960, this collection was re-issued by Moe Asch as one side of a Folkways LP called ''Songs of the Lincoln and International Brigades''. On the other side was a reissue of the legendary ''Six Songs for Democracy'' (originally recorded in Barcelona in 1938 while bombs were falling), performed by [[Ernst Busch (actor)|Ernst Busch]] and a chorus of members of the [[Thälmann Battalion]], made up of volunteers from Nazi Germany. The songs were: "Moorsoldaten" ([[Peat Bog Soldiers (song)|"Peat Bog Soldiers"]], composed by political prisoners of German concentration camps); "[[Freiheit (song)|Die Thaelmann-Kolonne]]", "Hans Beimler", "Das Lied Von Der Einheitsfront" ("Song of The United Front" by [[Hanns Eisler]] and [[Bertolt Brecht]]), "Der Internationalen Brigaden" ("Song of the International Brigades"), and "Los cuatro generales" ("The Four Generals", known in English as "The Four Insurgent Generals").

===Group recordings===
As a self-described "split tenor" (between an alto and a tenor),&lt;ref&gt;Wilkinson, "The Protest Singer" (2006), p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; Pete Seeger was a founding member of two highly influential folk groups: the [[Almanac Singers]] and [[the Weavers]]. The Almanac Singers, which Seeger co-founded in 1941 with [[Millard Lampell]] and Arkansas singer and activist [[Lee Hays]], was a topical group, designed to function as a singing newspaper promoting the industrial unionization movement,&lt;ref&gt;See Wikipedia entry on the [[Congress of Industrial Organizations|CIO]].&lt;/ref&gt; racial and religious inclusion, and other progressive causes. Its personnel included, at various times: Woody Guthrie, [[Bess Lomax Hawes]], [[Sis Cunningham]], [[Josh White]], and [[Sam Gary]]. As a controversial Almanac singer, the 21-year-old Seeger performed under the stage name "Pete Bowers" to avoid compromising his father's government career.

In 1950, the Almanacs were reconstituted as the Weavers, named after the title of an 1892 play by [[Gerhart Hauptmann]] about a workers' strike (which contained the lines, "We'll stand it no more, come what may!"). They did benefits for strikers at which they sang songs such as 'Talking Union', about the struggles for unionisation of industrial workers such as miners and auto mobile workers.&lt;ref&gt;Ingram, David. "The Jukebox in the Garden: Ecocriticism and American Popular Music Since 1960." ''Humanities Source''. 2010 Vol. 7. Retrieved October 14, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Besides Pete Seeger (performing under his own name), members of the Weavers included charter Almanac member Lee Hays, [[Ronnie Gilbert]], and [[Fred Hellerman]]; later [[Frank Hamilton (musician)|Frank Hamilton]], [[Erik Darling]], and [[Bernie Krause]] serially took Seeger's place. In the atmosphere of the 1950s red scare, the Weavers' repertoire had to be less overtly topical than that of the Almanacs had been, and its progressive message was couched in indirect language—arguably rendering it even more powerful. The Weavers on occasion performed in tuxedos (unlike the Almanacs, who had dressed informally) and their managers refused to let them perform at political venues. The Weavers' string of major [[Chart-topper|hit]]s began with "[[On Top of Old Smoky]]" and an arrangement of [[Lead Belly]]'s signature waltz, "[[Goodnight, Irene]]",&lt;ref name=pc1&gt;{{Pop Chronicles|1}}&lt;/ref&gt; which topped the charts for 13 weeks in 1950&lt;ref&gt;Alec Wilkinson, "The Protest Singer: Pete Seeger and American folk music," in ''[[The New Yorker]]'' (April 17, 2006), pp. 44–53.&lt;/ref&gt; and was covered by many other pop singers. On the flip side of "Irene" was the Israeli song "[[Tzena, Tzena, Tzena]]".&lt;ref name=pc1/&gt; Other Weaver hits included [[Woody Guthrie discography#1940, RCA Victor Sessions, Dust Bowl Ballads|"Dusty Old Dust" ("So Long It's Been Good to Know You" by Woody Guthrie)]], "[[Kisses Sweeter than Wine (song)|Kisses Sweeter Than Wine]]" (by Hays, Seeger, and Lead Belly), and the South African Zulu song by Solomon Linda, "[[Wimoweh]]" (about [[Shaka]]), among others.

The Weavers' performing career was abruptly derailed in 1953 at the peak of their popularity when blacklisting prompted radio stations to refuse to play their records and all their bookings were canceled. They briefly returned to the stage, however, at a sold-out reunion at Carnegie Hall in 1955 and in a subsequent [[reunion tour]], which produced a hit version of [[Merle Travis]]'s "[[Sixteen Tons]]" as well as LPs of their concert performances. "[[Kumbaya]]", a [[Gullah]] black spiritual dating from slavery days, was also introduced to wide audiences by Pete Seeger and the Weavers (in 1959), becoming a staple of Boy and Girl Scout campfires.

In the late 1950s, [[the Kingston Trio]] was formed in direct imitation of (and homage to) the Weavers, covering much of the latter's repertoire, though with a more buttoned-down, uncontroversial, and mainstream collegiate persona. The Kingston Trio produced another phenomenal succession of Billboard chart hits and in its turn spawned a legion of imitators, laying the groundwork for the 1960s commercial folk revival.

In the documentary film ''[[Pete Seeger: The Power of Song]]'' (2007), Seeger states that he resigned from the Weavers when the three other band members agreed to perform a [[jingle]] for a [[Tobacco advertising|cigarette commercial]].

===Banjo and 12-string guitar===
In 1948, Seeger wrote the first version of his now-classic ''How to Play the Five-String Banjo'', a book that many [[banjo]] players credit with starting them off on the [[musical instrument|instrument]]. He went on to invent the ''Long Neck'' or ''Seeger'' banjo. This instrument is three frets longer than a typical banjo, is slightly longer than a bass guitar at 25 frets, and is tuned a minor third lower than the normal 5-string banjo. Hitherto strictly limited to the Appalachian region, the five-string banjo became known nationwide as the American folk instrument par excellence, largely thanks to Seeger's championing of and improvements to it. According to an unnamed musician quoted in [[David King Dunaway]]'s biography, "by nesting a resonant chord between two precise notes, a melody note and a chiming note on the fifth string", Pete Seeger "gentrified" the more percussive traditional [[Appalachia]]n "frailing" style, "with its vigorous hammering of the forearm and its percussive rapping of the fingernail on the banjo head."&lt;ref&gt;Dunaway, ''How Can I Keep From Singing'', p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt; Although what Dunaway's informant describes is the age-old droned frailing style, the implication is that Seeger made this more acceptable to mass audiences by omitting some of its percussive complexities, while presumably still preserving the characteristic driving rhythmic quality associated with the style.

From the late 1950s on, Seeger also accompanied himself on the [[12-string guitar]], an instrument of Mexican origin that had been associated with [[Lead Belly]], who had styled himself "the King of the 12-String Guitar". Seeger's distinctive custom-made guitars had a triangular soundhole. He combined the long scale length (approximately 28") and [[capo|capo-to-key]] techniques that he favored on the banjo with a variant of [[Drop D tuning|drop-D (DADGBE) tuning]], tuned two whole steps down with very heavy strings, which he played with thumb and finger picks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acousticguitar.com/issues/ag115/gear115.html |title=Acoustic Guitar Central |publisher=Acousticguitar.com |date= |accessdate=November 20, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120913142102/http://www.acousticguitar.com/issues/ag115/gear115.html |archivedate=September 13, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Introduction of the "Steel Pan" to U.S. audiences===
In 1956, then "Peter" Seeger (see film credits) and his wife, Toshi, traveled to Port of Spain, [[Trinidad and Tobago|Trinidad]], to seek out information on the [[steelpan]], steel drum or "Ping-Pong" as it was sometimes called. The two searched out a local panyard director Isaiah and proceeded to film the construction, tuning and playing of the then new, national instrument of Trinidad-Tobago. He was attempting to include the unique flavor of the steel pan into American Folk music.

===The McCarthy era===
[[File:Pete Seeger NYWTS.jpg|thumb|right|1955]]In the 1950s and, indeed, consistently throughout his life, Seeger continued his support of civil and labor rights, racial equality, international understanding, and anti-militarism (all of which had characterized the Wallace campaign) and he continued to believe that songs could help people achieve these goals. With the ever-growing revelations of [[Joseph Stalin]]'s atrocities and the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, however, he became increasingly disillusioned with Soviet Communism. He left the CPUSA in 1949 but remained friends with some who did not leave it, though he argued with them about it.&lt;ref name="powersong"&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wnet/americanmasters/database/seeger_p.html "Pete Seeger: The Power of Song"] – PBS American Masters, February 27, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wnet/americanmasters/database/seeger_interview/index.html, Pete Seeger Interview] PBS American Masters.&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 18, 1955, Seeger was subpoenaed to testify before the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]] (HUAC). Alone among the many witnesses after the 1950 conviction and imprisonment of the [[Hollywood Ten]] for contempt of Congress, Seeger refused to plead the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]] (which would have asserted that his testimony might be self incriminating) and instead, as the Hollywood Ten had done, refused to name personal and political associations on the grounds that this would violate his [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] rights: "I am not going to answer any questions as to my association, my philosophical or religious beliefs or my political beliefs, or how I voted in any election, or any of these private affairs. I think these are very improper questions for any American to be asked, especially under such compulsion as this."&lt;ref&gt;Pete Seeger to the House Un-American Activities Committee, August 18, 1955. Quoted, along with some other exchanges from that hearing, in Wilkinson, "The Protest Singer" (2006), p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

He was convicted in a jury trial of contempt of Congress in March 1961, and sentenced to ten 1-year terms in jail (to be served simultaneously), but in May 1962, an appeals court ruled the indictment to be flawed and overturned his conviction.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12619416914263979951 ''United States v.

In 1960, the [[San Diego]] school board told him that he could not play a scheduled concert at a high school unless he signed an oath pledging that the concert would not be used to promote a communist agenda or an overthrow of the government. Seeger refused, and the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] obtained an [[injunction]] against the school district, allowing the concert to go on as scheduled. Almost 50 years later, in February 2009, the San Diego School District officially extended an apology to Seeger for the actions of their predecessors.&lt;ref name=SignOnSD&gt;{{cite web|last=Dillon|first=Raquel Maria|title=School board offers apology to singer Pete Seeger|url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/2009/feb/11/pete-seeger-apology-021109/?zIndex=51324|work=Sign on San Diego|accessdate=February 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Folk music revival===
To earn money during the blacklist period of the late 1950s and early 1960s, Seeger worked gigs as a music teacher in schools and summer camps, and traveled the college campus circuit. He also recorded as many as five albums a year for [[Moe Asch]]'s [[Folkways Records]] label. As the nuclear disarmament movement picked up steam in the late 1950s and early 1960s, Seeger's anti-war songs, such as, "[[Where Have All the Flowers Gone?]]" (co-written with [[Joe Hickerson]]), "[[Turn! Turn! Turn! (song)|Turn! Turn! Turn!]]",&lt;ref name=pc33&gt;{{Pop Chronicles |33}}&lt;/ref&gt; adapted from the [[Book of Ecclesiastes]], and "[[The Bells of Rhymney]]" by the Welsh poet [[Idris Davies]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/southeast/sites/caerphilly/pages/bellsofrhymney.shtml |title=BBC News – South East Wales |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=|accessdate=November 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1957), gained wide currency. Seeger also was closely associated with the [[Civil Rights Movement]] and in 1963 helped organize a landmark [[Carnegie Hall]] concert, featuring the youthful [[Freedom Singers]], as a benefit for the [[Highlander Folk School]] in Tennessee. This event and [[Martin Luther King]]'s [[March on Washington]] in August of that year brought the Civil Rights anthem "[[We Shall Overcome]]" to wide audiences where he sang it on the 50-mile walk from Selma to Montgomery, Ala. along with 1,000 other marchers.&lt;ref&gt;Whitehead, John. "Pete Seeger: Changing The World One Song At A Time." ''Waxahachie Daily Light''. May 30, 2013. Rutherford Institute. Accessed on October 14, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;
By this time, Seeger was a senior figure in the 1960s folk revival centered in [[Greenwich Village]], as a longtime columnist in ''[[Sing Out!]]'', the successor to the People's Songs ''Bulletin'', and as a founder of the topical [[Broadside Magazine|''Broadside'']] magazine. To describe the new crop of politically committed folk singers, he coined the phrase "Woody's children", alluding to his associate and traveling companion, Woody Guthrie, who by this time had become a legendary figure. This urban folk-revival movement, a continuation of the activist tradition of the 1930s and 1940s and of [[People's Songs]], used adaptations of traditional tunes and lyrics to effect social change, a practice that goes back to the [[Industrial Workers of the World]] or Wobblies' ''Little Red Song Book'', compiled by Swedish-born union organizer [[Joe Hill]] (1879–1915). (The ''Little Red Song Book'' had been a favorite of Woody Guthrie's, who was known to carry it around.){{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

Seeger toured Australia in 1963. His single "[[Little Boxes]]", written by Malvina Reynolds, was number one in the nation's Top 40s. That tour sparked a folk boom throughout the country at a time when popular music tastes, post-[[Assassination of JFK|Kennedy assassination]], competed between folk, the [[Surf music|surfing craze]], and the British rock boom which gave the world [[the Beatles]] and [[The Rolling Stones]], among others. Folk clubs sprung up all over the nation, folk performers were accepted in established venues, and Australian performers singing Australian folk songs – many of their own composing – emerged in concerts and festivals, on television, and on recordings, and overseas performers were encouraged to tour Australia.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

The long television blacklist of Seeger began to end in the mid-1960s, when he hosted a regionally broadcast, educational, folk-music television show, ''[[Rainbow Quest]]''. Among his guests were [[Johnny Cash]], [[June Carter]], [[Reverend Gary Davis]], [[Mississippi John Hurt]], [[Doc Watson]], [[the Stanley Brothers]], [[Elizabeth Cotten]], [[Patrick Sky]], [[Buffy Sainte-Marie]], [[Tom Paxton]], [[Judy Collins]], [[Hedy West]], [[Donovan]], [[The Clancy Brothers]], [[Richard Fariña]] and [[Mimi Fariña]], [[Sonny Terry]] and [[Brownie McGhee]], Mamou Cajun Band, [[Bernice Johnson Reagon]], The Beers Family, [[Roscoe Holcomb]], [[Malvina Reynolds]], Sonia Malkine, and [[Shawn Phillips]]. Thirty-nine&lt;ref name="powersong"/&gt; hour-long programs were recorded at [[WNJU]]'s [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]] studios in 1965 and 1966, produced by Seeger and his wife Toshi, with Sholom Rubinstein. The [[Smothers Brothers]] ended Seeger's national blacklisting by broadcasting him singing "[[Waist Deep in the Big Muddy]]" on their CBS variety show on February 25, 1968, after his similar performance in September 1967 was censored by CBS.&lt;ref&gt;''Dangerously Funny: The Uncensored Story of the Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour'', by David Bianculli, Touchstone, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1976, Seeger wrote and recorded the anti-death penalty song "Delbert Tibbs", about the [[Delbert Tibbs|eponymous death-row inmate]], who was later [[exonerated]]. Seeger wrote the music and selected the words from poems written by Tibbs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.peteseeger.net/songwriter_magazine.htm |title=Songwriter – Pete Seeger and Writing For Freedom |publisher=Peteseeger.net |date=July 28, 1976 |accessdate=September 5, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120912091020/http://www.peteseeger.net/songwriter_magazine.htm |archivedate=September 12, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pete Seeger and Bob Dylan====
Pete Seeger was one of the earliest backers of [[Bob Dylan]] and was responsible for urging A&amp;R man [[John H. Hammond|John Hammond]] to produce Dylan's first LP on [[Columbia Records|Columbia]], and for inviting him to perform at the [[Newport Folk Festival]], of which Seeger was a board member.&lt;ref&gt;Fellow Newport Board member [[Bruce Jackson (scholar)|Bruce Jackson]] writes, "Pete Seeger, more than any of the other board members, had a personal connection with Bob Dylan: it was he who [in 1962] had convinced the great Columbia A and R man John Hammond, famous for his work with jazz and blues musicians, to produce Dylan's eponymous first album, ''Bob Dylan''. If anyone was responsible for Bob Dylan's presence on the Newport Stage [in 1965], it was Pete Seeger". See Bruce Jackson, ''The Story Is True: The Art and Meaning of Telling Stories'' (Philadelphia: Temple University Press, 2008), p. 148.&lt;/ref&gt; There was a widely repeated story that Seeger was so upset over the extremely loud amplified sound that Dylan, backed by members of the [[Paul Butterfield|Butterfield Blues Band]], brought into the 1965 [[Newport Folk Festival]] that he threatened to disconnect the equipment. There are multiple versions of what went on, some fanciful. What is certain is that tensions had been running high between Dylan's manager [[Albert Grossman]] and Festival Board members (who besides Seeger also included [[Theodore Bikel]], [[Bruce Jackson (scholar)|Bruce Jackson]], [[Alan Lomax]], festival MC [[Peter Yarrow]], and [[George Wein]]) over the scheduling of performers and other matters. Two days earlier, there had been a scuffle and brief exchange of blows between Grossman and Alan Lomax, and the Board in an emergency session had voted to ban Grossman from the grounds but had backed off when George Wein pointed out that Grossman also managed highly popular draws [[Odetta]] and [[Peter, Paul and Mary]].&lt;ref&gt;[[John Szwed]], ''Alan Lomax, 'The Man Who Recorded the World'' (Viking, 2010), p. 354. The Butterfield Blues Band, a new, integrated Chicago-based electric band, was the closer in an afternoon blues workshop entitled "Blues: Origins and Offshoots", hosted by Lomax, that had included African-American blues greats [[Willie Dixon]], [[Son House]], [[Memphis Slim]], and a prison work group from Texas, along with bluegrass pioneer [[Bill Monroe]] and the Bluegrass Boys. Lomax, upset that Butterfield's group had been shoehorned into his workshop, reportedly complained aloud about how long they took to set up their electrical equipment and introduced them with the words, "Now, let's find out if these guys can play at all." This infuriated Grossman (who was angling to manage the new group), and he responded by attacking Lomax physically. [[Mike Bloomfield|Michael Bloomfield]] stated, "Alan Lomax, the great folklorist and musicologist, gave us some kind of introduction that I didn't even hear, but Albert found it offensive. And Albert went upside his head. The next thing we knew, right in the middle of our show, Lomax and Grossman were kicking ass on the floor in the middle of thousands of people at the Newport Folk Festival. Tearing each other's clothes off. We had to pull 'em apart. We figured 'Albert, man, now there's a manager!{{'"}} quoted in Jan Mark Wolkin, Bill Keenom, and Carlos Santana's, ''Michael Bloomfield: If You Love These Blues'' (San Francisco: Miller Freeman Books), p. 102. See also Ronald D. Cohen's introduction to "Part III, The Folk Revival (1960s)" in ''Alan Lomax: Selected Writings'', Ronald D. Cohen, ed. (London: Routledege), p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt; Seeger has been portrayed as a folk "purist" who was one of the main opponents to Dylan's [[Electric Dylan controversy|"going electric"]].&lt;ref&gt;Rock critic [[Greil Marcus]] wrote: "Backstage, Peter Seeger and the great ethnomusicologist Alan Lomax attempted to cut the band's power cables with an axe." See Greil Marcus, ''Invisible Republic, the Story of the Basement Tapes'' [1998], republished in paperback as ''The Old, Weird America: The World of Bob Dylan's Basement Tapes'' (New York: Holt, 2001), p. 12. Marcus's apocryphal story was elaborated by [[Maria Muldaur]] and [[Paul Nelson (critic)|Paul Nelson]] in [[Martin Scorsese]]'s film ''No Direction Home'' (2005),&lt;/ref&gt; but when asked in 2001 about how he recalled his "objections" to the electric style, he said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I couldn't understand the words. I wanted to hear the words. It was a great song, "[[Maggie's Farm]]," and the sound was distorted. I ran over to the guy at the controls and shouted, "Fix the sound so you can hear the words." He hollered back, "This is the way they want it." I said "Damn it, if I had an axe, I'd cut the cable right now." But I was at fault. I was the MC, and I could have said to the part of the crowd that booed Bob, "you didn't boo [[Howlin' Wolf]] yesterday. He was electric!" Though I still prefer to hear Dylan acoustic, some of his electric songs are absolutely great. Electric music is the vernacular of the second half of the twentieth century, to use my father's old term.&lt;ref&gt;David Kupfer, [http://www.wholeearthmag.com/ArticleBin/406.html Longtime Passing: An interview with Pete Seeger], ''Whole Earth'' magazine, Spring 2001.

===Vietnam War era and beyond===
[[File:Pete Seeger Stern Grove.jpg|thumb|Pete Seeger, Stern Grove, San Francisco CA  8/6/78]]
A longstanding opponent of the arms race and of the Vietnam War, Seeger [[satire|satirically]] attacked then-President [[Lyndon B. Johnson|Lyndon Johnson]] with his 1966 recording, on the album ''[[Dangerous Songs!?]]'', of [[Len Chandler]]'s children's song, ''"[[Beans in My Ears]]"''. Beyond Chandler's lyrics, Seeger said that "Mrs. Jay's little son Alby" had "beans in his ears," which, as the lyrics imply,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sniff.numachi.com/pages/tiBEANEARS.html |title=Beans in My Ears |publisher=Sniff.numachi.com |date= |accessdate=November 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ensures that a person does not hear what is said to them. To those opposed to continuing the [[Vietnam War]], the phrase implied that "Alby Jay", a loose pronunciation of Johnson's nickname "LBJ," did not listen to anti-war protests as he too had "beans in his ears".

During 1966, Seeger and [[Malvina Reynolds]] took part in environmental activism. The album ''[[God Bless the Grass]]'' was released on January of that year and became the first album in history wholly dedicated to songs about environmental issues. Their politics were informed by the same ideologies of nationalism, populism, and criticism of big business.&lt;ref&gt;Ingram, David (2008). 'My Dirty Stream : Pete Seeger, American Folk Music, and Environmental Protest', ''Popular Music'' Vol. 31, pp22. Routeledge Taylor &amp; Francis Group. October 14, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Seeger attracted wider attention starting in 1967 with his song "[[Waist Deep in the Big Muddy]]", about a [[Captain (land)|captain]]—referred to in the lyrics as "the big fool"—who drowned while leading a platoon on maneuvers in [[Louisiana]] during World War II. With its lyrics about a platoon being led into danger by an ignorant captain, the song's anti-war message was obvious- the line "the big fool said to push on" is repeated several times.&lt;ref&gt;Gibson, Megan. "Songs of Peace and Protest: 6 Essential Cuts From Pete Seeger." ''Time.com'', January 28, 2014. p.1 Business Source Complete. October 14, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; In the face of arguments with the management of [[CBS]] about whether the song's political weight was in keeping with the usually light-hearted entertainment of the ''[[Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour]]'', the final lines were "Every time I read the paper/those old feelings come on/We are waist deep in the Big Muddy and the big fool says to push on." The lyrics could be interpreted as an allegory of Johnson as the "big fool" and the [[Vietnam War]] as the foreseeable danger. Although the performance was cut from the September 1967 show,&lt;ref&gt;''Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour'', CBS, Season 2, Episode 1, September 10, 1967.&lt;/ref&gt; after wide publicity,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.peteseeger.net/givepeacechance.htm |title=How "Waist Deep in the Big Muddy" Finally Got on Network Television in 1968 |publisher=Peteseeger.net |date= |accessdate=November 20, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130805061813/http://www.peteseeger.net/givepeacechance.htm |archivedate=August 5, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; it was broadcast when Seeger appeared again on the Smothers' Brothers show in the following January.&lt;ref&gt;''Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour'', CBS, Season 2, Episode 24, February 25, 1968.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the November 15, 1969,&lt;!-- November is correct; incorrect October date widely quoted on web -pls do not change --&gt; [[Moratorium to End the War in Vietnam|Vietnam Moratorium March]] on Washington, DC, Seeger led 500,000 protesters in singing [[John Lennon]]'s song "[[Give Peace a Chance]]" as they rallied across from the White House. Seeger's voice carried over the crowd, interspersing phrases like, "Are you listening, [[Richard Nixon|Nixon]]?" between the [[refrain|chorus]]es of protesters singing, "All we are saying ... is give peace a chance".&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, [https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/vietnam/series/pt_09.html this PBS documentary] and this {{YouTube|ZUn-EGsNt58|recording}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Inspired by Woody Guthrie, whose guitar was labeled "This machine kills fascists"&lt;sup&gt;[[:Image:Woody Guthrie.jpg|photo]]&lt;/sup&gt; Seeger's banjo was emblazoned with the motto "This Machine Surrounds Hate and Forces It to Surrender."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/guano/114357902/in/photostream/ |title=Pete Seeger's banjo |publisher=Flickr |date= |accessdate=September 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the documentary film ''The Power of Song'', Seeger mentions that he and his family visited North Vietnam in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite video|people=Brown, Jim (Director)|title=The Power of Song|medium=DVD|publisher=Genius Products LLC|date=2005|isbn=1-59445-156-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Being a supporter of progressive labor unions, Seeger had supported [[Edward Sadlowski|Ed Sadlowski]] in his bid for the presidency of the [[United Steelworkers of America]]. In 1977, Seeger appeared at a fundraiser in [[Homestead, Pennsylvania]]. In 1978, Seeger joined American folk, blues, and jazz singer [[Barbara Dane]] at a rally in New York for striking coal miners.&lt;ref&gt;The Pete Seeger Reader edited by Ronald D. Cohen, James Capaldi [https://books.google.com/books?id=6QAuAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA209&amp;lpg=PA209&amp;dq=Pete+Seeger+Barbara+Dane&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Li0Jgd9y_R&amp;sig=NrG6OqLDi_nJLbceWCyEfFTe_-o&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=QCkBVPXkCtGNuAT_0IKwBA&amp;ved=0CEAQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=Pete%20Seeger%20Barbara%20Dane&amp;f=false] Page. 209&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980, Pete Seeger performed in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The performance was later released by Smithsonian Folkways as the album "Singalong Sanders Theater, 1980".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://folkways.si.edu/pete-seeger/singalong-sanders-theater-1980/american-folk-struggle-protest/music/album/smithsonian|title=Singalong Sanders Theater, 1980|website=Smithsonian Folkways Recordings|accessdate=November 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pollution of the Hudson River===
The most discussed pollution of the Hudson River is [[General Electric]]'s contamination of the river with [[Polychlorinated biphenyl]]s (PCBs) between 1947 and 1977.&lt;ref name="epa_ge"&gt;{{cite web|title=Hudson River PCBs — Background and Site Information |publisher=[[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] |url=http://www.epa.gov/hudson/background.htm |accessdate=2007-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; This pollution caused a range of harmful effects to wildlife and people who eat fish from the river or drink the water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Priorities List Fact Sheets: Hudson River PCBs |publisher=EPA |url=http://www.epa.gov/Region2/superfund/npl/0202229c.pdf |accessdate=2007-12-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071201054957/http://www.epa.gov/Region2/superfund/npl/0202229c.pdf |archivedate=December 1, 2007 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to this contamination, activists protested in various ways. Musician Pete Seeger founded the [[Hudson River Sloop Clearwater]] and the [[Clearwater Festival]] to draw attention to the problem. The activism led to the site being designated as one of the [[superfund]] sites.&lt;ref name=upi.com&gt;{{cite news|first=Gerry|last=Harrington|title=Movement afoot to name bridge after Pete Seeger |url=http://www.upi.com/Entertainment_News/Music/2014/01/31/Movement-afoot-to-name-bridge-after-Pete-Seeger/UPI-15581391204873/ |work=[[United Press International]] |date=2014-01-31 |accessdate=2014-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reflection on support for Soviet Communism===
In 1982, Seeger performed at a benefit concert for [[August 31, 1982 demonstrations in Poland|Poland's Solidarity resistance movement]]. His biographer [[David King Dunaway|David Dunaway]] considers this the first public manifestation of Seeger's decades-long personal dislike of communism in its Soviet form.&lt;ref name="dunawayp103"&gt;David King Dunaway (2008), p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1980s Seeger also expressed disapproval of violent revolutions, remarking to an interviewer that he was really in favor of incremental change and that "the most lasting revolutions are those that take place over a period of time."&lt;ref name="dunawayp103"/&gt; In his autobiography ''Where Have All the Flowers Gone'' (1993, 1997, reissued in 2009), Seeger wrote, "Should I apologize for all this? I think so." He went on to put his thinking in context:

&lt;blockquote&gt;How could [[Hitler]] have been stopped? [[Maxim Litvinov|Litvinov]], the Soviet delegate to the [[League of Nations]] in '36, proposed a worldwide quarantine but got no takers. For more on those times check out pacifist [[Dave Dellinger]]'s book, ''From Yale to Jail&amp;nbsp;...''&lt;ref&gt;David T. Dellinger, ''From Yale to Jail: The Life Story of a Moral Dissenter'' (New York: Pantheon Books, 1993 {{ISBN|0-679-40591-7}}).&lt;/ref&gt; At any rate, today I'll apologize for a number of things, such as thinking that Stalin was merely a "hard driver" and not a "supremely cruel misleader." I guess anyone who calls himself a Christian should be prepared to apologize for the [[Inquisition]], the burning of heretics by Protestants, the slaughter of Jews and Muslims by [[Crusades|Crusaders]]. White people in the U.S.A. ought to apologize for [[Indian removal|stealing land from Native Americans]] and [[Slavery in the United States|enslaving blacks]]. Europeans could apologize for worldwide conquests, Mongolians for [[Genghis Khan]]. And supporters of [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Roosevelt]] could apologize for his support of [[Somoza family|Somoza]], of [[Dixiecrat|Southern White Democrats]], of [[Francoist Spain|Franco Spain]], for putting [[Japanese American internment|Japanese Americans in concentration camps]]. Who should my granddaughter Moraya apologize to? She's part African, part European, part Chinese, part Japanese, part Native American. Let's look ahead.&lt;ref&gt;''Where Have All the Flowers Gone: A Musical Autobiography'', edited by Peter Blood (Bethlehem, Pennsylvania: A Sing Out Publication, 1993, 1997), page 22.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nyt1" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In a 1995 interview, however, he insisted that "I still call myself a communist, because communism is no more what Russia made of it than Christianity is what the churches make of it."&lt;ref name="The Old Left"&gt;{{cite news | title = The Old Left | work = New York Times Magazine | url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE7D7123BF931A15752C0A963958260&amp;n=Top/Reference/Times%20Topics/People/S/Seeger,%20Pete | date = January 22, 1995 | accessdate=May 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In recent years, as the aging Seeger began to garner awards and recognition for his lifelong activism, he also found himself criticized once again for his opinions and associations of the 1930s and 1940s. In 2006, [[David Boaz]]—[[Voice of America]] and [[NPR]] commentator and president of the [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] [[Cato Institute]]—wrote an opinion piece in ''[[The Guardian]]'', entitled "Stalin's Songbird" in which he excoriated ''[[The New Yorker]]'' and ''[[The New York Times]]'' for lauding Seeger. He characterized Seeger as "someone with a longtime habit of following the party line" who had only "eventually" parted ways with the CPUSA. In support of this view, he quoted lines from the [[Almanac Singers]]' May 1941 ''Songs for John Doe'', contrasting them darkly with lines supporting the war from ''Dear Mr. President'', issued in 1942, after the United States and the Soviet Union had entered the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2006/apr/14/post33?commentpage=1|title=Stalin's songbird|accessdate=March 27, 2009|publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited | location=London | first=David | last=Boaz | date=April 14, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boaz's article is reprinted in his book, ''The Politics of Freedom'' (Washington, D.C.: The Cato Institute, 2008) pp. 283–84&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, in response to criticism from a historian [[Ronald Radosh|Ron Radosh]], a former [[Trotskyite]] who now writes for the conservative ''[[National Review]]''—Seeger wrote a song condemning Stalin, "Big Joe Blues":&lt;ref&gt;Dunaway, ''How Can I Keep From Singing'', p. 422.&lt;/ref&gt; 

&lt;blockquote&gt;I'm singing about old Joe, cruel Joe. / He ruled with an iron hand. /He put an end to the dreams / Of so many in every land. / He had a chance to make / A brand new start for the human race. / Instead he set it back / Right in the same nasty place. / I got the Big Joe Blues. / Keep your mouth shut or you will die fast. / I got the Big Joe Blues. / Do this job, no questions asked. / I got the Big Joe Blues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newstatesman.com/society/2007/09/joe-blues-folk-music-seeger Seeger turns on Uncle Joe], NewStatesMan, September 27, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

The song was accompanied by a letter to Radosh, in which Seeger stated, "I think you're right, I should have asked to see the [[gulag]]s when I was in U.S.S.R [in 1965]."&lt;ref name="nyt1"&gt;Daniel J.

On March 16, 2007, Pete Seeger, his sister [[Peggy Seeger|Peggy]], his brothers [[Mike Seeger|Mike]] and John, his wife Toshi, and other family members spoke and performed at a symposium and concert sponsored by the [[American Folklife Center]] in honor of the [[Seeger family]], held at the [[Library of Congress]] in Washington, D.C.,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.loc.gov/folklife/Seegersymposium/ "How Can I Keep from Singing?": A Seeger Family Tribute]. 2007 symposium and concert, American Folklife Center, Library of Congress (web presentation includes program, photographs, and webcasts).&lt;/ref&gt; where Pete Seeger had been employed by the Archive of American Folk Song 67 years earlier.

In September 2008, [[Appleseed Recordings]] released ''At 89'', Seeger's first studio album in 12 years. On September 29, 2008, the 89-year-old singer-activist, once banned from commercial TV, made a rare national TV appearance on the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'', singing "Take It From Dr. King".

On January 18, 2009, Seeger and his grandson [[Tao Rodríguez-Seeger]] joined [[Bruce Springsteen]], and the crowd in singing the Woody Guthrie song "[[This Land Is Your Land]]" in the finale of Barack Obama's Inaugural concert in Washington, D.C.&lt;ref name=Tuscaloosa&gt;Tommy Stevenson, [http://www.truth-out.org/archive/item/82100:this-land-is-your-land-like-woody-wrote-it "'This Land Is Your Land' Like Woody Wrote It"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140220194941/http://www.truth-out.org/archive/item/82100:this-land-is-your-land-like-woody-wrote-it |date=February 20, 2014 }}, ''Truthout'', January 19, 2009.

Over the years, he lent his fame to support numerous environmental organizations, including South Jersey's Bayshore Center, the home of New Jersey's tall ship, the oyster schooner A.J. Meerwald. Seeger's benefit concerts helped raise funds for groups so they could continue to educate and spread environmental awareness.&lt;ref&gt;Jennings, Jennifer.

Cuban singer-songwriter [[Silvio Rodríguez]] was also invited to appear but his visa was not approved in time by the United States government. Consistent with Seeger's long-time advocacy for environmental concerns, the proceeds from the event benefited the [[Hudson River Sloop Clearwater]],&lt;ref name="clearwater"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clearwater.org/ |title=Hudson River Sloop Clearwater |publisher=Clearwater.org |date= |accessdate=November 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; a non-profit organization founded by Seeger in 1966, to defend and restore the [[Hudson River]].

On September 19, 2009, Seeger made his first appearance at the 52nd Monterey Jazz Festival, which was particularly notable because the festival does not normally feature folk artists.

In 2010, still active at the age of 91, Seeger co-wrote and performed the song ''[[God's Counting on Me, God's Counting on You]]'' with Lorre Wyatt, commenting on the [[Deepwater Horizon oil spill]].&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Doyle, [https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/17386/184956 Video: Pete Seeger Debuts New BP Protest Song: Songwriter talks inspiration behind "God's Counting on Me, God's Counting on You"], ''Rolling Stone'' online, July 26, 2010.

On an interview he gave that day to [[Democracy Now!]], Seeger sang "I Come and Stand at Every Door" as it was also the 68th anniversary of bombing of Nagasaki.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Shows featuring Pete Seeger|url=http://www.democracynow.org/appearances/pete_seeger|work=Democracy Now!|accessdate=September 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pete Seeger &amp; Onondaga Leader Oren Lyons on Fracking, Indigenous Struggles and Hiroshima Bombing|url=http://www.democracynow.org/blog/2013/8/9/pete_seeger_onondaga_leader_oren_lyons_on_fracking_indigenous_struggles_and_hiroshima_bombing|work=Democracy Now!|accessdate=September 20, 2013|date=August 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death===

Seeger died at New York-Presbyterian Hospital on January 27, 2014, at the age of 94.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/29/arts/music/pete-seeger-songwriter-and-champion-of-folk-music-dies-at-94.html?_r=0] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150714022101/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/29/arts/music/pete-seeger-songwriter-and-champion-of-folk-music-dies-at-94.html?_r=0 |date=July 14, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Response and reaction to Seeger's death quickly poured in. President [[Barack Obama]] noted that Seeger had been called "America's tuning fork"&lt;ref&gt;The phrase "America's tuning fork" is usually attributed to poet [[Carl Sandburg]], for example, see Corey Sandler, ''Henry Hudson: Dreams and Obsessions'' (New York: Kensington Books, 2007), p. 203. It is unclear when and where Sandburg, who thought highly of the Weavers, said this. Studs Terkel, who introduced Seeger as "America's tuning fork" at the 1959 Newport Folk Festival (see George Wein, Nate Chinen, ''Myself Among Others: A Life in Music'' [Da Capo Press, 2009], p. 314), later wrote that he had seen the phase in ''[[Down Beat]]'' jazz magazine (see Terkel, ''Hope Dies Last: Keeping The Faith In Troubled Times'' [New York: The New Press], p. 249). The phrase was picked up in a [https://books.google.com/books?id=NEgEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA61&amp;dq=Pete+Seeger+America%27s+tuning+fork&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=vgNYU9ekFOTKsQS65IGoDw&amp;ved=0CF8Q6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Pete%20Seeger%20America's%20tuning%20fork&amp;f=false photo spread on Seeger] by [[Life (magazine)|Life Magazine]] (October 9, 1964), p. 61 (see also Ronald D. Cohen, ''Rainbow Quest: The Folk Music Revival and American Society, 1940–70'' [University of Massachusetts Press, 1970], p. 223).&lt;/ref&gt; and that he believed in "the power of song" to bring social change, "Over the years, Pete used his voice and his hammer to strike blows for workers' rights and civil rights; world peace and environmental conservation, and he always invited us to sing along. For reminding us where we come from and showing us where we need to go, we will always be grateful to Pete Seeger."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Obama memorializes Pete Seeger|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/theoval/2014/01/28/obama-pete-seeger-bruce-springsteen/4958941/|work=USA Today|accessdate=January 28, 2014|date=January 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Folksinger and fellow activist [[Billy Bragg]] wrote that: "Pete believed that music could make a difference.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4841">'''Protodeacon''' derives from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''proto-'' meaning 'first' and ''diakonos'', which is a standard ancient Greek word meaning "assistant", "servant", or "waiting-man". The word in [[English language|English]] may refer to any of various clergy, depending upon the usage of the particular church in question.

==Eastern Orthodox and Eastern Catholic churches==
[[Image:Archdeacon by Repin.jpg|thumb|200px|Portrait of an Orthodox protodeacon wearing the distinctive burgundy [[skufia]], by [[Ilya Repin]], 1877 ([[Tretyakov Gallery]], [[Moscow]]).]]

Protodeacon is an honorific rank given to certain married [[deacon]]s in [[Eastern Christian]] churches. In the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] it is an honorary title given to married deacons, as a mark of which, the clergyman is entitled to wear a [[Burgundy (color)|burgundy]]-colored [[skufia]]. The equivalent rank for [[Hierodeacon]]s—i.e., [[monk|monastic]] deacons—is [[Archdeacon]]. The senior deacon of a [[cathedral]] or [[Synod#Orthodox usage|principal church]] may be awarded the title of protodeacon. In the Greek usage, the chief deacon who is attached to the person of a bishop is called an archdeacon. In the Slavic usage a protodeacon or archdeacon wears a distinctive [[orarion]] (deacon's stole). 

The title of protodeacon is an award, not a distinctive [[Holy Orders|order of ministry]]; so while a man may be [[ordained]] a deacon, he is said to be 'elevated' to the rank of protodeacon. This elevation may be awarded only by the deacon's own [[ruling bishop]]. The [[Ritual|rite]] of elevation is identical for both a protodeacon and an archdeacon, and is normally done during the [[Little Entrance]] of the [[Divine Liturgy]].  

A protodeacon has [[Order of precedence|precedence]] when serving with other deacons, regardless of the date of his own ordination to the diaconate. If several protodeacons serve at the same time, their order of precedence is determined by the date of their elevation.

In the ''[[Archieratikon]]'' ([[Church Slavonic|Slavonic]]: ''Chinovnik''), the [[liturgical book]] containing the services as celebrated by a [[bishop]], the term Protodeacon is used to refer to the senior-ranking deacon who is serving, regardless of whether or not he has actually had that rank bestowed upon him.

==Latin Church==
{{Catholic Church Hierarchy}}
{{see also|Latin Church|College of Cardinals}}
In the [[Roman rite]], the senior [[Cardinal_(Catholicism)#Cardinal_deacon|Cardinal Deacon]] is the Cardinal Protodeacon of the Holy Roman Church. He has the privilege of announcing the new [[Pope]]'s election and name (once he has been ordained to the Episcopate&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/apost_constitutions/documents/hf_jp-ii_apc_22021996_universi-dominici-gregis_en.html Ap. Const. Universi Dominici Gregis], No. 89&lt;/ref&gt;) in the [[Habemus Papam]] announcement given from the central balcony at [[St. Peter's Basilica]] in [[Vatican City State]]. In the past, during papal coronations, the Proto-Deacon also had the honor of bestowing the pallium on the new pope and crowning him with the [[papal tiara]]. However, in 1978 Pope John Paul I chose not to be crowned and opted for a simpler papal inauguration ceremony, and his three successors followed that example. As a result, the Cardinal protodeacon's privilege of crowning a new pope has effectively ceased. However, the Proto-Deacon still has the privilege of bestowing the pallium on a new pope at his papal inauguration.  “Acting in the place of the [[Roman Pontiff]], he also confers the [[pallium]] upon [[metropolitan bishop#Roman Catholic|metropolitan bishops]] or gives the pallium to their proxies.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P19.HTM Canon 355 §2.]&lt;/ref&gt;  The current Cardinal Proto-Deacon is [[Renato Martino]].&lt;ref name=VNS&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/news_services/liturgy/2014/documents/ns_lit_doc_20140612_optatio-diaconis-cardinalibus_it.html|title=Assegnazione del titolo presbiterale ad alcuni cardinali diaconi creati nel consistoro del 21 ottobre 2003|language=Italian|date=2014-06-12|accessdate=2014-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Richard Rose 1974.jpg|thumb|right|Richard Rose in 1974]]

'''Richard Rose''' (March 14, 1917 – July 6, 2005) was an American [[mysticism|mystic]], [[esotericism|esoteric]] [[philosophy|philosopher]], author, poet, and investigator of [[paranormal]] phenomena. He published a number of books and spoke widely in universities and other venues across the country during the 1970s and 1980s.

Rose developed a system which he described as the "retreat from untruth," an examination of personal belief systems and lifestyles. In that system one discards what one finds to be false on a case-by-case basis. He believed a spiritual Ultimate [[truth]] exists and can be found for oneself with sufficient application of effort, and recommended [[skepticism|skeptical]] approaches such as his.

He studied human [[psychology]], human weakness and human potential, then wrote challenges to psychology, [[psychiatry]], [[religion]], academia, the legal system, and the [[New Age]] movement. His criticism included issues of [[group-think]], [[dogmatism]], financial motives, emotional appeals, and reliance on questionable authorities.

==Biography==

Richard Rose was born in [[Benwood, West Virginia]], USA. He entered a [[Catholic]] pre-seminary in [[Butler, Pennsylvania]] at age 12.  He later recounted his delight at the prospect of living with monks and nuns who he believed had direct connections to God. He became disillusioned though with the teachers and with their insistence that he accept what they taught on blind [[faith]]. He left the seminary at age 17 still looking for God but having decided to do so through [[science]].&lt;ref&gt;Kent, John (1990) pp.1-2&lt;/ref&gt; He then studied [[chemistry]] and [[physics]] in college but became disillusioned with the possibility of finding God or Truth through science. He then traveled around the U.S., in a series of jobs such as work on the first [[nuclear submarine]] at Babcock &amp; Wilcox in Alliance, Ohio, on [[streptomycin]] at the National Jewish Medical &amp; Research Center in Denver, and performing [[metallurgy|metallurgical]] testing for [[Martin Aircraft]] in Baltimore.

While living in Baltimore, his older brother James was killed on a  [[Merchant Marine]] vessel when it was torpedoed by a German [[U-boat]]. His death provided a huge shock to Rose, who contrasted his brother's selfless attitude to his own spiritual ego.

Rose was working in the spring of 1947 as a waiter at a tennis club in Seattle when he experienced what he described as "God Realization". Several months later, he wrote a description of what had occurred in ''The Three Books of the Absolute''.&lt;ref&gt;Martin (2007) p.82&lt;/ref&gt;

A few years later he married and raised a family. He supported the family as a painting contractor and by raising cattle on the family farm. He worked with people who were interested in [[parapsychology|parapsychological]] phenomena such as [[Extra-sensory perception|ESP]] and [[hypnosis]], but said he never come across anyone working to answer questions about the nature of the mind and reality. It was in this period that he compiled his first book, ''The Albigen Papers'' published in 1973, outlining his philosophy.

In 1972 Rose was invited to give a talk at the [[Theosophical Society]] in Pittsburgh. Two students from the [[University of Pittsburgh]] attended, and they were inspired to start a group at the university to apply Rose's teaching. In 1973, Rose and a handful of students set up the TAT Foundation &amp;mdash; "a circle of friends with no head" &amp;mdash; to promote their efforts to reach out to others. The acronym TAT stood for "Truth and Transmission."&lt;ref&gt;Kent (1990) p.6&lt;/ref&gt; The Pittsburgh group spawned groups at other northeastern universities and even a couple of western locations (Denver and Los Angeles). Rose made his farm available for group gatherings and individual retreats, and students built two large buildings for meetings as well as cabins for individual use. The following two decades saw hundreds of people inspired to launch their own spiritual searches.

Rose continued to write and publish while his study groups expanded. His public lectures continued until the early 1990s, when he started to show signs of deterioration from [[Alzheimer's disease]].

==Teachings==

Rose's student David Gold described his work as esoteric &lt;ref&gt;Gold (2002) p.196, 319&lt;/ref&gt; and direct.&lt;ref&gt;Gold (2002) p.171&lt;/ref&gt; Rose chose not to establish a popular movement of students, instead preferring a [[Wiktionary:sub-rosa|sub-rosa]] network of close students, who then reached out to a larger circle, which included author [[Joseph Chilton Pearce]].

He came from humble roots, then studied as a scientist. His teachings were based on a lifetime of experience and research, and in particular an experience when he was thirty. Joseph Chilton Pearce described him: "Rose is a no-nonsense [[West Virginia]]n who wants nothing more from life than to somehow pass on the cataclysmic spiritual experience, the [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|Enlightenment]] that blind-sided him when he was a young man."

=== Tenets ===

His student John Kent felt Rose's teachings were difficult to describe, because Rose stressed inner work inherently subjective and intimate to each individual. They were more about pursuing personal insight and introspection than a set of specific techniques.&lt;ref&gt;Kent (1990) p.50&lt;/ref&gt;  Nonetheless, according to Kent, Rose did formulate a system of teachings based on his study of other traditions and his own insights.&lt;ref&gt;Kent (1990) pp.50-51&lt;/ref&gt; Kent summarized the core questions in the teachings as:&lt;ref&gt;Kent (1990) p.54&lt;/ref&gt; 
# Who am I (ultimately)?
# Where did I come from (before birth)?
# Where am I going (after death)?

Rose recommends a deep investigation of "who" is living and experiencing: clearly defining self and ego.&lt;ref&gt;Kent (1990) pp.54-55&lt;/ref&gt; He also insisted that a life of activity is meaningless as long as the identity of the actor is not known. He thought approaching [[spirituality]] as a way to find peace or enhance one's life, which he called "utilitarian," was foolish. Instead he advocated total dedication to a search for truth — in particular concerning self and ego — in spite of the personal consequences.

He used the term "Jacob's Ladder" ([http://www.searchwithin.org/download/jacobs_ladder.jpg image]) as a kind of transpersonal map.&lt;ref&gt;Kent (1990) pp.vi, 24, 32, 42, 254-255&lt;/ref&gt; Based on that, he then used the terms "Law of the Ladder"&lt;ref&gt;Kent (1990) pp.121, 140&lt;/ref&gt; and "Ladder Work" to describe different levels he observed among those seeking truth. He also believed that one could only effectively help, or be helped by, others who were on the same or adjacent rungs of the ladder. He felt "extra-proportional returns" were realized when a group of people combine their efforts in any endeavor, which he called the "Contractor's Law".&lt;ref&gt;Kent (1990) p.140&lt;/ref&gt;

Rose cautioned against postulating what truth — with respect to self and ego, for example — should be and then trying to move toward it. Instead one removes misunderstandings. His working definition of [[truth]] was "a condition from which all untruth has been removed."&lt;ref&gt;Rose (1978) p. 206&lt;/ref&gt;  He used the phrases "retreat from error"&lt;ref&gt;Kent (1990) p.17&lt;/ref&gt; and "reverse vector"&lt;ref&gt;Kent (1990) pp.76, 120&lt;/ref&gt; to describe the process of moving away from the most obviously false, what he called "garbage," which would clarify the thinking and intuition to a point where more subtle untruth could be evaluated.&lt;ref&gt;Kent (1990) pp.213, 216&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rose (1982) p.144&lt;/ref&gt;

He published ''The Albigen Papers'' in 1973, which he called a guidebook for seekers. His theories about the transmutation of energy from the body through the mind up to what he called the "spiritual quantum,"&lt;ref&gt;Kent (1990) pp.190-191&lt;/ref&gt; were published after that and similar to some recent theories describing the mind as a force-field. He produced a pamphlet on a method of meditation involving the dispassionate review of past traumatic events as a way to overcome psychological problems and to understand the ego. His book ''Psychology of the Observer'' encapsulated his views on the structure of mind-processes and what he described as the internal ascent from a personal, conflicted view of the world to a more Universal perspective.

He was a [[hypnotism|hypnotist]], occasionally giving demonstrations, and said that understanding hypnotism was a key to understanding the mechanics of the mind.&lt;ref&gt;Direct Mind Experience, pp. 28-29 and p. 291.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Six unpublished, recorded lectures and demonstrations: 1978, 1980, 1981, 1986, 1988&lt;/ref&gt; His criticism of spiritual and New Age movements often included references to their use of self-hypnotic methods.&lt;ref&gt;Kent (1990) p.99&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Martin (2007) p.86&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Recommended Study ===

His student John Kent described the culmination of Rose's philosophy as corresponding "most closely with the [[nondualism]] of Advaita Vedanta".&lt;ref&gt;Kent (1990) p. 35&lt;/ref&gt; But Kent also writes that rather than presenting a concept-structure or a specific practice upon which his teachings could be based Rose instead advocated personal immersion into available methods and religious styles while always applying what he called "respectful doubt."&lt;ref&gt;Kent (1990) p.126&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, his followers obtained an understanding of a wide number of esoteric groups and methods, which they were able to bring back and share among themselves. Rose also believed that progress on one's spiritual path was linked to one's efforts at helping others.

Rose recommended a number of authors to his students and disparaged other authors, based on his research. Those he most highly recommended were Indian guru [[Ramana Maharshi]], Chan master [[Huangbo Xiyun|Huang Po]], Christian mystics [[St. John of the Cross]] and [[Teresa of Avila]], [[George Gurdjieff]], and researchers [[Paul Brunton]] and [[Richard Bucke]].  In ''Albigen Papers'' he described [[H.P. Blavatsky]]'s books as "some of the most valuable a student can own," and in his publication of ''Profound Writings East &amp; West'', called her text ''Book of Golden Precepts'' (also ''Voice of the Silence'') as "a condensed guide to the deepest teachings of mankind." Rose advocated the study of what he called [[Thaumaturgy|thaumaturgical laws]]&lt;ref&gt;I.e., celibacy&lt;/ref&gt; as a means to protect oneself from unseen influences, for anyone who would explore the dimensions of consciousness ("the mind dimension"), referring to texts by [[Eliphas Levi]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;Eliphas Levi, Transcendental Magic; Arthur Edward Waite, Ceremonial Magic.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Unpublished lecture at Kent State University on April 12, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Teaching Style and Methods ===

According to Kent, Rose advocated a very personal commitment similar to [[Gurdjieff]] and he discouraged casual commitment.&lt;ref&gt;Kent, John (1990) p.76&lt;/ref&gt; Aspects of his style which discouraged casual commitment included: a [[Zen]]-like method of confrontation, recommending a [[celibate]] lifestyle,&lt;ref&gt;Kent, John (1990) p.174&lt;/ref&gt; and strong criticism of what he described as social and political [[Sacred cow (idiom)|sacred cow]]s. In personal interactions he would attempt to dispel illusions and falsehoods that students were hiding from themselves. This sharpness caused his students to call him a [[Zen]] master, even though he was highly critical of mainstream Zen. In fact, the first group established by Rose was called Zen Study Group, in Pittsburgh, reflecting his embrace of Zen methods, and other groups were called Pyramid Zen Society, an admission that those interested in total commitment would be few (the top of the pyramid) as explained in various recorded talks.&lt;ref&gt;Lecture in Columbus, Ohio, April 5, 1977. http://www.searchwithin.org/download/columbus_ohio_lecture.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; He felt that requiring students to be determined would produce a more committed group of thinkers and researchers.

Rose gave a series of lectures in the 1970s which outlined his approach to Zen and which incorporated the term Zen in the title: ''The Psychology of Zen''; ''Zen and Common Sense''; ''Zen and Death''; etc. Several of these have been transcribed from the audio tapes and published. He published for limited circulation a paper titled ''The Monitor Papers'' which established rules, guidelines and techniques to be observed during confrontation in the private group meetings where confrontation was permitted.

Rose had a high regard for Alfred Pulyan, a Zen teacher in Connecticut, who gave him a method of [[Dharma transmission|Transmission]] referred to in Zen literature.&lt;ref&gt;Attribution to Zen methods learned from Alfred Pulyan are in unpublished talk in Columbus, Ohio on Oct. 23, 1977. ''Laws, Yardsticks, Exaltations''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mentioned by Rose occasionally in public and private talks, currently being transcribed. For example: http://www.searchwithin.org/download/columbus_ohio_lecture.pdf  Also there is a series of unpublished correspondence between Rose and Pulyan in the possession of the heirs.&lt;/ref&gt; Rose wrote a handbook for local group leaders, ''The Monitor Papers'', currently unpublished, giving instructions on how to create ''rapport'', which in his view is a precursor to Transmission, and he published ''Energy Transmutation, Between-ness and Transmission'' in 1975.

Stemming from his investigations into [[Spiritualism]], in his early lectures he often related his findings on paranormal phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;Martin (2007) pp.74-75&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==

He worked closely with groups, beginning with university students and professional people, mostly in the Northeast (e.g. Pennsylvania, Ohio, Massachusetts, Maryland, West Virginia).  Over time, as the students graduated and entered professional lives, groups were also established in Colorado, California, North Carolina, Florida, and Maine. After he was hospitalized with Alzheimer's in the mid 1990s, many of the organizations failed, but some continued- notably, the Self-Knowledge Symposium at universities in North Carolina.

His followers believe he never pursued widespread popularity.&lt;ref&gt;Gold (2002) p.166&lt;/ref&gt; Members of the TAT Foundation, the current umbrella organization, are dispersed geographically. People may attend study groups without becoming actual members of the umbrella group.

==New Vrindaban==

In 1967, Rose attempted to create an [[ashram]] of spiritual seekers on his [[Marshall County, West Virginia]] farm, and composed a letter which was published in the [[San Francisco Oracle]] expressing his desire to try "to form an ashram of sorts here in West Virginia, in the rural section where I own about a half a section. The conception is one of a non-profit, non-interfering, non-denominational, retreat or refuge, where philosophers might come to work communally together, or independently,—where a library and other facilities might be developed.",&lt;ref&gt;Richard Rose, Letter published in The San Francisco Oracle (December 1967)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"McCreary Ridge Hippies Live Quietly in Hills Meditating" (July 13, 1968, Wheeling Intelligencer) http://selfdefinition.org/rose/richard-rose-farm-1968.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the seekers who responded to his letter were [[ISKCON|Hare Krishna]] devotees [[Kirtanananda Swami]] (Keith Gordon Ham) and his partner [[Hayagriva Swami|Hayagriva Das]] (Howard Morton Wheeler). The two secured a 99-year lease on Rose's backwoods farm which eventually developed into the sprawling [[New Vrindaban]] Community which eventually included [[Prabhupada's Palace of Gold]], and this community pressed against Rose's farm from all sides.&lt;ref&gt;Hayagriva Das, ''The Hare Krishna Explosion'' (Palace Press, Moundsville, West Virginia: 1985)&lt;/ref&gt;  When Rose attempted to fight the Krishnas in court and win back his land for non-payment of taxes, there was some talk at the community about "eliminating" him, and a hit man allegedly followed him for a while.  Despite his troubles with the Krishnas, Rose reportedly never expressed outright regret over his decision to lease his back farm to them. "In some ways the Krishnites are better to have around than the hillbillies," Rose said once. "At least they don't get drunk and steal the radiators out of your trucks."&lt;ref&gt;Richard Rose, quoted by David Gold, ''After the Absolute'', chapter 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sawashfan''' (died 8th-century) was the ruler of the [[Afrighids|Afrighid dynasty]] of [[Khwarezm]] during the 8th-century. He was the son and successor of [[Askajamuk II]].

He is one of the few Afrighid rulers whose coins have been identified. The coin shows a bust of Sawashfan to the left, while it shows him on horseback to the right. Sawashfan is known in [[China|Chinese]] sources as Shao-she-fien, where he in 751 is reportedly said to have requested help from the [[Tang dynasty]]. Sawashfan was later succeeded by his son [[Torkasbatha]].

'''Seven of Swords''' is a [[Minor Arcana]] [[tarot]] card.
Tarot cards are used throughout much of [[Europe]] to play [[Tarocchi|Tarot card games]].&lt;ref name="DummettGame"&gt;
{{cite book
  | last = Dummett
  | first = Michael

  | publisher = [[Gerald Duckworth and Company Ltd.|Gerald Duckworth and Company Ltd]]
  | date = 1980
  | isbn = 0-7156-1014-7
 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[English language|English]]-speaking countries, where the games are largely unknown, Tarot cards came to be utilized primarily for [[Tarot reading|divinatory]] purposes.&lt;ref name="DummettGame" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt; [[Paul Huson|Huson, Paul]], (2004) ''Mystical Origins of the Tarot: From Ancient Roots to Modern Usage'', Vermont: Destiny Books, {{ISBN|0-89281-190-0}}
[http://www.innertraditions.com/Product.jmdx?action=displayDetail&amp;id=887&amp;searchString=huson&amp;y=7&amp;x=7 ''Mystical Origins of the Tarot''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927225647/http://www.innertraditions.com/Product.jmdx?action=displayDetail&amp;id=887&amp;searchString=huson&amp;y=7&amp;x=7 |date=2007-09-27 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Divination usage==

A hasty decision, greed and/or thoughtless behavior, the individual acts in an impulsive fashion. It represents secret plans, hidden dishonor, frustration and the possibility of failure.

==Common interpretation==

The Seven of Swords, when upright means to use your wits for diplomacy and not to use aggression, this is why it can be viewed as secret planning or hidden dishonor, your acts may be legitimate however you prefer to use your mind and intellect rather than force or via obvious means.

The Reversed meaning of the card means excess use of intellect with little success on an outcome, to surrender, or to have little care on solving a problem. The questioner needs to break away from ingrained habits or ways to approach problems. 

==Rider-Waite symbolism==

The figure is taking stealthy steps, looking back to examine the scene he is leaving. Apparently he is doing something he knows he should not be doing, and is attempting to get away with it anyway.

[[File:White sage smudge sticks.jpg|thumb|Bundled sage]]
'''Smudging''' is a [[ceremony]] practiced by some [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas]], that involves the burning of sacred herbs, in some cases for spiritual cleansing or blessing. While the particulars of the ceremonies, and the herbs used can vary widely between tribes and nations, many use forms of sage (for example, [[Salvia officinalis|common sage]] or [[Salvia apiana|white sage]]) and [[Cedar wood|cedar]] that is local to their region. Not all [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] and [[First Nations]] cultures that burn herbs for ceremony call what they do, ''smudging''. While using [[scent]] and scented smoke (such as [[incense]]) in religious and spiritual [[rite]]s is an element common to many different cultures worldwide, the details and spiritual meanings are usually unique to the specific cultures in question.&lt;ref name="Hobson"&gt;Hobson, G. "The Rise of the White Shaman as a New Version of Cultural Imperialism" in: Hobson, G., ed. The Remembered Earth. Albuquerque, NM: Red Earth Press; 1978: 100-108.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Aldred"&gt;Aldred, Lisa, "Plastic Shamans and Astroturf Sun Dances: New Age Commercialization of Native American Spirituality" in: ''The American Indian Quarterly'' issn.24.3 (2000) pp.329-352. The University of Nebraska Press.&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Native American tradition==
In some [[First Nations]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/first-nations-teen-told-to-stop-smudging-or-face-suspension-from-school-1.1674604|title=First Nations teen told to stop smudging or face suspension from school|publisher=[[CTV.ca]]|accessdate=2014-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] ceremonies, certain herbs are traditionally used to purify or bless people and places. For instance, some cultures use the smoke of burning [[Thuja plicata|red cedar]] as part of purification and healing ceremonies,&lt;ref name=Lyon&gt;{{cite book|last=Lyon|first=William S.|title=Encyclopedia of Native American Healing |publisher=[[W.W. Norton &amp; Company, Inc.]]|year=1998|isbn=0-393-31735-8|page=173}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sometimes smudging is done in hospitals to "cleanse and repel evil influence."&lt;ref name="Boughman"/&gt; However, the same herbs that are burned by one culture may be taboo to burn in another, or they may be used for a completely different purpose. When specific herbs are burned ceremonially, this may or may not be called "smudging", depending on the culture. Traditionally, when gathering herbs for ceremonial use, care is taken to determine the time of day, month, or year when the herbs should be collected; for example, at dawn or evening, at certain phases of the moon, or according to yearly cycles.  Gertrude Allen, a [[Lumbee]], reported that her father, an expert in healing with plants, stated that sage varies in potency at different times of the year.&lt;ref name="Boughman"&gt;Boughman, A. L., &amp; Oxendine, L. O. (2003). Herbal remedies of the Lumbee Indians. Jefferson, N.C., McFarland.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Controversy===
Some of the terminology in use among non-[[Indigenous peoples|Indigenous]] people, such as the American [[English language|English]] term "smudge stick" is usually found in use among those who imitate what they believe are [[Indigenous peoples of North America|Native American]] [[Native American religion|sacred ceremonies]]. However, the herbs used in commercial "smudge sticks" or "sage bundles," and the [[rite|rituals]] performed with them by non-Natives, are rarely the actual materials or ceremonies used by traditional Native Americans. Use of these objects have also been adopted in some forms into a number of modern belief systems, including many forms of [[New Age]] and eclectic [[Neopaganism|Neopagan]] spirituality. This has been protested against by Native activists as a form of [[cultural misappropriation]].&lt;ref name="Hobson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Aldred"/&gt; 

Smudging "kits" are often sold commercially, despite traditional prohibitions against the sale of spiritual medicines like [[Salvia apiana|white sage]].&lt;ref name="Hobson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Aldred"/&gt; These may include bundles of a single herb or a combination of several different herbs; often these herbs are not found bundled together in traditional use, and their use is not universal to all, or even most, Native cultures. In some Native American cultures the burning of these herbs is prohibited.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}} Other commercial items may contain herbs not native to North America, or not indigenous to the region where they are being used, as well as substances that are toxic when burnt.

[[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] students in college dorms have at times faced harassment and been forbidden from burning herbs for ceremonial reasons due to university policies that prohibit the burning of candles or incense in college dorm rooms. This has raised issues around the religious freedom of Native Americans.&lt;ref name="Stokes"&gt; Stokes, DaShanne. 2001. "Sage, Sweetgrass, and the First Amendment."

[[File:World Shrine of Sukyo Mahikari.jpg|thumb|World Shrine of Sukyo Mahikari]]

'''Sukyo Mahikari''' ("Sukyo" means universal principles and "Mahikari" means True Light) is an organization with centers in more than 100 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chang|2007|p=139}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sukyo Mahikari, History"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sukyomahikarieurope.org/en/organisation.html|title=Sukyo Mahikari, History}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization aims to help people improve the quality of their lives and attain happiness by practicing universal principles and a method of spiritual purification called the art of True Light. It was founded by [[Yoshikazu Okada|Kotama Okada]] in 1959 under the name L. H. Yokoshi no Tomo.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chang|2007|pp=137–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://philtar.ucsm.ac.uk/encyclopedia/easia/mahik.html|title=Sukyo Mahikari, History2|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100113132539/http://philtar.ucsm.ac.uk/encyclopedia/easia/mahik.html|archivedate=2010-01-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sukyo Mahikari was registered on 23 June 1978 by Keishu Okada as part of an [[Mahikari#Sukyo Mahikari|amicable settlement]] following the passing of Kotama Okada.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chang|2007|pp=138–139}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, Sukyo Mahikari announced it had a membership of approximately one million practitioners.&lt;ref name="World Religions"&gt;{{cite web

==Beliefs and practices==
The organization aims to promote peace and harmony in society through the practice of a method of spiritual purification and the practice of universal principles, such as gratitude, acceptance, and humility in all aspects of life.&lt;ref name="Sukyo Mahikari, About"&gt;{{cite web
|url       =http://www.sukyo-mahikari.org
|title     =Sukyo Mahikari, About
|publisher =Sukyo Mahikari North America
|accessdate=2009-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The art of True Light===
Sukyo Mahikari introduces a practice to purify one's spiritual aspect as an expedient toward attaining happiness. Radiating Light from the palm of the hand is a method of spiritual purification that cleanses the spirit, mind and body. It is said to help open the way to resolving all manner of problems. By purifying the spiritual aspect with the Light and leading a life based on principles of sustainability, people can revive their spirituality and attain increasing health, harmony and prosperity.

The transmission of Light is referred to as "the art of True Light."  Through the palm of the hand, a person (the giver) radiates Light to another person (the receiver), allowing them to purify and revitalize their spirit, mind and body.&lt;ref name="Sukyo Mahikari, Light Energy"&gt;{{cite web
|url       =http://www.sukyo-mahikari.org
|title     =Sukyo Mahikari, Light Energy
|publisher =Sukyo Mahikari North America
|accessdate=2009-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Radiating Light can be practiced by anyone who so desires, by attending the Sukyo Mahikari primary course.

A session of Light typically begins with both the giver and receiver offering a short prayer. Next, the giver of Light recites a prayer that is believed to have a strong power to purify (the "Amatsu Norigoto Prayer"). The giver then holds his or her hand approximately 30 centimeters (12 inches) from the receiver's body. Sessions of Light usually last anywhere from 10 to 50 minutes.&lt;ref name="Chang 2007 50"&gt;{{harvnb|Chang|2007|p=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sukyo Mahikari does not advocate the use of the art of True Light as a substitute for medical treatment or therapy.&lt;ref name="Sukyo Mahikari, Light Energy"/&gt; The founder of Mahikari, Mr. Kotama Okada, taught that the purpose of the art of True Light is not to heal disease or illness, but to be of service to society, bring happiness to people, and attain divine nature.&lt;ref name="Chang 2007 50"/&gt;

The art of True Light is said to purify the spiritual realm of one's home and society, making them more peaceful and harmonious. Thus, members are encouraged to radiate the Light to anything, anywhere, and at anytime. Thus, the Light is not only radiated to human beings, but also to animals, food, buildings, and the natural environment.&lt;ref name="Chang 2007 50"/&gt;

===Universal principles===
Sukyo Mahikari teaches the concept of [[natural laws|universal principles]] that, when practiced together with the Light, allow one to more quickly attain spiritual and personal growth.&lt;ref name="Sukyo Mahikari North America"&gt;{{cite web
|url       =http://www.sukyomahikari.org/universalprinciples.html
|title     =Sukyo Mahikari, Universal Principles
|publisher =Sukyo Mahikari North America
|accessdate=2009-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sukyo Mahikari encourages people to incorporate the divine principles in their daily life by practicing virtues such as altruistic love, gratitude, humility and acceptance of the will of God.&lt;ref name="Sukyo Mahikari North America" /&gt;&lt;!--{{Fact}} begin--&gt;&lt;!--{{Fact}} end--&gt; Members also practice prayer, cultivating positive and cheerful attitudes, promoting harmony, charity and helping others, and being of service to God.&lt;ref name="Sukyo Mahikari North America"/&gt;

Founder Kotama Okada believed that if people lived in accordance with the universal principles, they would cultivate their spirituality, and naturally come to use science and technology that was integrated with an understanding of spirituality, to find solutions to pressing issues facing humanity.&lt;ref name="Sukyo Mahikari North America"/&gt;

===Other beliefs===
Sukyo Mahikari promotes the practice of yoko agriculture. The practice of yoko agriculture involves organic agriculture combined with the use of positive words and attitudes to help people to cultivate respect for nature and restore soil to its pure and fertile condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Is the future in our hands? My experiences with Sukyo Mahikari|last=Tebecis|first=Andris|publisher=Sunrise Press|year=2004|isbn=0-9593677-4-8|location=Canberra, Australia|pages=307}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, respect for nature and the natural environment is encouraged. The arbitrary use of chemical fertilizers, without consideration for the local environment, is discouraged. The organization has helped to create natural farms and promotes the distribution of natural and organic produce throughout the world.&lt;ref&gt;C. Cornille, "New Japanese Religions in the West: Between Nationalism and Universalism", Chapter 1, in "Japanese new religions: in global perspective, Routledge publication, Volume 1999 pp. 17, 2000, {{ISBN|0-7007-1185-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization and membership==

===Headquarters, regional headquarters, and local centers===
The headquarters of Sukyo Mahikari is located in Takayama City, Gifu Prefecture, Japan. 
Sukyo Mahikari has established regional headquarters in Australia-Oceania, Asia, Europe, Africa, Latin America, and North America, with centers located in over 100 countries.&lt;ref name="Sukyo Mahikari, About"/&gt; 
Within the United States and Canada, Sukyo Mahikari has 21 spiritual development centers.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sukyomahikari.org/northamerica.html Retrieved 12 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Membership===
Sukyo Mahikari currently has approximately a million practitioners who form its membership.&lt;ref name="World Religions"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Adherents.com"/&gt;

Becoming a member of Sukyo Mahikari does not require giving up any pre-existing beliefs or accepting Sukyo Mahikari as the only path or faith. Sukyo Mahikari teaches that the art of True Light and the universal principles transcend religious denominations  and differences in ethnicity, nationality, and ideology. Sukyo Mahikari promotes cooperation and understanding between religious organizations toward establishing a sustainable and peaceful society. The emphasis the organization places on the spiritual unity of human beings has resulted in a membership that reflects a diversity of religions and nationalities.&lt;ref name="Chang 2007 50"/&gt;

Sukyo Mahikari does not practice any form of [[tithe]]. The organization is sustained by the voluntary contributions (offerings) made by members. Rather than the amount, emphasis is placed on making offerings with sincerity. People are encouraged to make offerings that are voluntary and not beyond one's means. There are no mandatory contributions. However, there is a set amount for the appreciation offering to attend the introductory course and the spiritual cord maintenance offering. Members are encouraged to offer the monthly spiritual cord maintenance offering, which is approximately  $7 in the U.S. and a similar amount in other regions.&lt;ref name="Sukyo Mahikari North America"/&gt;  Cornille writes that there are a number of types of offerings in the organization: the spiritual cord maintenance offering; True Light appreciation offering; the special protection appreciation offering, and so on.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cornille|1991|p=269}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Yoko Civilization Research Institute==
In 1985 Keishu Okada established the Yoko Civilization Research Institute (YCRI). The objective of the forum is to find solutions to today’s problems by having leaders in different fields, regardless of their race, nationality, religion, and ideology, come together to share their acquired wisdom.

1st Yoko International Conference was held on Oct 30 to Nov 1, 1986. The theme was "Creating the future of mankind."

2nd Yoko International Conference was held on Oct 28 to Nov 1, 1989. The theme was "What does it mean to be human?"

3rd Yoko International Conference was held on Aug 18 to Aug 21, 1999. The theme was "Life and environment."

4th Yoko International Conference was held on September 18 to Sep 21, 2005. The theme was "Science and religion in the age of crisis."

The 5th Yoko International Conference was supposed to be held on November 20–23, 2011. The theme was "Coexistence between nature and human beings: viewed through agriculture". It was cancelled due to the Great East Japan Earthquake.

==Reception==
Sukyo Mahikari members have been involved in charity and social services around the world, such as in Côte d'Ivoire and Senegal (planting of trees and revival of  national parks), in Angola (activities for children, elderly people, and beautify urban areas) and in both New York and Hawaii (for environmental cleanup activities).&lt;ref name="Sukyo Mahikari, Partnerships"&gt;{{cite web

|title     =Sukyo Mahikari, Partnerships
|accessdate=2009-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2000, Sukyo Mahikari co-sponsored the UN Millennium Summit of World Religious Leaders.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iuscanada.com/journal/archives/2001/j0301p41.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2004, Los Angeles mayor James Hahn presented Sukyo Mahikari of North America with a proclamation commending the organization for its efforts in helping to create a peaceful and harmonious society;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Resolution by Councilmember 15th District, President of the Council, Mayor of Los Angeles, California |url=http://www.sukyomahikari.org/images/lamahikari.jpg |publisher =''City of Los Angeles, California'' |year=2004 |accessdate=26 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in September 2009, Mayor Mufi Hannemann of Honolulu presented Sukyo Mahikari with a certificate declaring September 27 as Sukyo Mahikari Day in Honolulu in recognition of beach and park cleanup activities that the organization has conducted there over the past ten years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Proclamation by the Mayor of Honolulu, Hawaii |url=http://www.sukyomahikari.org/images/hawaii_proclamation.jpg |publisher =''City and County of Honolulu, Hawaii'' |year=2009 |accessdate=26 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 6, 2010, the New York Center of Sukyo Mahikari was presented with a High Performance Building Plaque from The New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA) in pursuing a LEED ([[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design]]) Silver rating from the U.S. Green Buildings Council. The plaque was given in recognition of energy-efficient measures incorporated into the new center that will help cut its energy costs by $8,400 per year and reduce its carbon footprint in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url =http://www.nyserda.ny.gov/Press_Releases/2010/PressReleas20100506.asp|title=NYSERDA Press Releases|publisher=NYSERDA|accessdate=2010-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/feeds/prnewswire/2010/04/29/prnewswire201004291100PR_NEWS_USPR_____LA95866.html |title=FORBES Press Release |publisher=Forbes |accessdate=2010-07-21 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, an award for excellence in reforestation activities was presented to Sukyo Mahikari by the President of Côte d'Ivoire.  The award was in recognition of the reforestation activities of the Sukyo Mahikari youth members of Africa. At the presentation ceremony in Takayama, the award was presented on behalf of the president by Côte d'Ivoire's Minister for Environment, Water and Forests, Mr. Mathieu Babaud Darret.  

Since 2016, Sukyo Mahikari was granted special consultative status with the Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) of the United Nations.&lt;ref&gt;http://esango.un.org/civilsociety/displayConsultativeStatusSearch.do?method=search&amp;sessionCheck=false&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Catherine Cornille]] writes in a research paper that the attrition rate is high. She also states "The emphasis on miracles and magic in Mahikari, on the other hand, accounts for the large turnover of members..."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cornille|1991|p=283}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[List of groups referred to as cults or sects in government documents|1995 and 1999 parliamentary reports]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Rapport fait au nom de la Commission d'enquête sur les sectes — ''Les sectes en France'' |url=http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/rap-enq/r2468.asp |publisher =''Assemblée Nationale'' |language=French |year=1995 |accessdate=25 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Rapport fait au nom de la Commission d'enquête sur les sectes – ''Les sectes et l'argent'' |url=http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/dossiers/sectes/r1687anx.asp |publisher=''Assemblée Nationale'' |language=French |year=1999 |accessdate=25 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; the organization was listed as having new-age tendencies, however, no conclusions were made regarding sectarian phenomena and as of 27 May 2005, the French government decided to stop periodically releasing a list of organizations associated with sectarian phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lepoint.fr/content/societe/article?id=19641 |title=La fin des listes noires |work=Le Point |language=French |date=23 June 2005 |accessdate=25 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tennent is also one of four graduates of a three-year mentoring in academic leadership program funded through a [[Lilly Endowment]] grant.

Tennent began his teaching career at [[Toccoa Falls College]], where he was named Teacher of the Year in 1995. From 1998&amp;ndash;2009, he served as professor of world missions and Indian studies at [[Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary]] in [[South Hamilton, Massachusetts|South Hamilton]], [[Massachusetts]].&lt;ref name="asburyseminary1"/&gt;

He was elected to his current post as president of Asbury Seminary on February 17, 2009 and his tenure began on July 1, 2009.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9565">The '''Valmadonna Trust Library''' was a collection of 13,000 printed books and manuscripts printed in [[Hebrew]] or in [[Hebrew script]]. It was sold by the Trustees in January 2017 to the [[National Library of Israel]].&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://worldisraelnews.com/national-library-gets-finest-collection-of-hebrew-prints-and-manuscripts/|title=National Library gets finest collection of Hebrew prints and manuscripts {{!}} World Israel News|date=2017-01-24|newspaper=World Israel News|access-date=2017-02-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is named after [[Valmadonna]], a small town near [[Alessandria]] in north-west [[Italy]] with longstanding connections to the Lunzer family.&lt;ref name="nyt2009"/&gt; The collection encompasses works from throughout the world, particularly [[Italy]], "the cradle of Hebrew printing",&lt;ref name="bnet"/&gt; and covers over a millennium; many items in the collection are rare or unique, and many date back to the earliest Hebrew printings.&lt;ref name="nyt2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bnet"/&gt; According to [[Arthur Kiron]], curator of [[Judaica]] collections at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], "I don't know any other collection quite like it in private hands. It even rivals some of the great institutional collections in the world." &lt;ref name="bnet"/&gt;

==Collection==
Notable items in the collection include the following:
*A well-preserved set of the [[Babylonian Talmud]] (1519–23) designed by a panel of scholars and codifying many aspects of how the Talmud is laid out, printed in [[Venice]] by [[Daniel Bomberg]]; Lunzer acquired this in 1980 from the collection of [[Westminster Abbey]] in exchange for a 900-year-old copy of the Abbey’s original Charter, and supporting endowments, fulfilling a 25-year dream.&lt;ref name="nyt2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bnet"&gt;"[http://blog.beliefnet.com/news/2009/02/rare-trove-of-hebrew-books-dis.php Rare Trove of Hebrew Books Displayed in NYC]", ''[[Beliefnet]] News'', February 10, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; This item was sold in 2015, see below.&lt;ref name=tablet /&gt;
*A [[Hebrew Bible]] from [[England]] (known as the ''Codex Valmadonna I''), handwritten in 1189 and looted the next year during the destruction of the Jewish community of [[York]], which is the only known surviving Hebrew text from England dated prior to the expulsion of the [[Jews]] in 1290 under [[King Edward I]].,&lt;ref name="nyt2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bnet"/&gt;
*A Franco-German [[Pentateuch]], probably written in the 10th or 11th century
*A 12th-century scroll of the [[Pentateuch]] from the [[Samaritan]]s, written in the [[Samaritan alphabet]].&lt;ref name="nyt2009"/&gt;
*The first [[Mikraot Gedolot]]
*The earliest dated illustrated [[Haggadah of Pesach]] known to exist, printed in [[Prague]] in 1526.&lt;ref name="nyt2009"/&gt;
*A Pentateuch from [[Constantinople]] dated 1547, containing [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Greek language|Greek]] translations written using Hebrew script.&lt;ref name="nyt2009"&gt;"[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/12/books/12hebr.html?_r=1 A Lifetime’s Collection of Texts in Hebrew, at Sotheby’s]", [[Edward Rothstein]], ''[[New York Times]]'', February 11, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;
*One of the first illustrated Hebrew books: A 1492 [[Mishna]] with commentary by [[Maimonides]]
*The first book printed in Lisbon, 1489, [[Nahmanides]]’ commentary on the Pentateuch.
*A 19th-century copy of ''[[One Thousand and One Nights|A Thousand and One Nights]]'' from [[Calcutta]], in [[Arabic]] spelled out in Hebrew script.&lt;ref name="nyt2009"/&gt;
*An illustrated guide for ''[[shechita]]'' from early 20th-century [[Pakistan]], with Hebrew and [[Marathi language|Marathi]] on facing pages.&lt;ref name="nyt2009"/&gt;
*A copy of every Hebrew book published in [[Cremona]] during the ten-year period such printing was allowed, ending in the 1560s.&lt;ref name="nyt2009"/&gt;
*The first book ever printed in [[Turkey]], a 1493 copy of the ''[[Arba'ah Turim]]''.&lt;ref name="nyt2009"/&gt;
*The first book ever printed in [[Africa]], a Hebrew book about prayer from [[Fes, Morocco|Fez]] dated 1516.&lt;ref name="nyt2009"/&gt;
*The first scientific work printed in [[Portugal]], by [[Abraham Zacuto]] in 1496.&lt;ref name="nyt2009"/&gt;
*An 1848 copy of the ''[[Communist Manifesto]]'' in [[German language|German]], one of eleven surviving copies of the first edition's February 1848 second printing in [[London]].&lt;ref name="NYT1986"&gt;"[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A0DE4DD133CF933A05756C0A960948260&amp;scp=6&amp;sq=valmadonna&amp;st=cse 'Manifesto,' From 1848, Is Sold for $39,811]", ''[[New York Times]]'', May 30, 1986&lt;/ref&gt;

*A 1666 Dutch newspaper with a front page headline and article describing [[Sabbatai Zevi]].
*A Venice Sukka decoration from 1783.

==Collection sale==
In early 2009, the collection, estimated to be worth in excess of US$40 million, was placed for sale by [[Sotheby's]], with the proviso that it be sold as a whole and not broken up,&lt;ref name="nyt2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bnet"/&gt; and remain accessible to scholars. The custodian [[Jack V. Lunzer]], who is not benefitting from the proceeds of the sale, has stated that "I would like our library to be acquired by the [[Library of Congress]]. That would be my great joy."&lt;ref name="bnet"/&gt;  After visiting the exhibition of the collection at Sotheby's, a scholar from the [[Drisha Institute]] wrote of Lunzer's achievement:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The morning of our visit, I studied the commentary of Rabbi [[David Kimhi]], who is known as the Radak, on Joseph's conflict with his brothers. Honestly, it felt like just another of the many rabbinic commentaries....  Then I went to the Valmadonna. Peering closely at one of the oldest manuscripts, I saw that it was a volume of Psalms with the Radak's commentary.  In that instant, time and space collapsed as I found myself bound to every other Jew who has studied Kimhi's work since it was penned in the late 12th and early 13th centuries. That moment made clear to me that I am not simply a modern Jew studying in a contemporary yeshiva near [[Lincoln Center]]. I am tied to every other Jew through 800 years of history. I envision Kimhi hunched over his work, and wonder if his soul knows that even still we are learning from him, that his elucidation remains as relevant to the study of biblical text as it was to his contemporaries. The books of the Valmadonna – the books of our people – bring history alive [and] keep our history alive even when the communities that produce them are long dead.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, Debra Nussbaum.

In May 2011, ''[[The Jewish Chronicle]]'' in London reported that the collection was still for sale, perhaps for around US$25 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thejc.com/news/world-news/48829/valmadonna-goes-back-market Valmadonna goes back on the market], by Robyn Rosen, 11 May 2011, ''[[The Jewish Chronicle]]'', accessed 21 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2015, Sotheby's New York presided over the sale of the [[Daniel Bomberg]] ''Babylonian [[Talmud]]'' (1519-1523) from the Valmadonna Trust for $9.3 million, the copy that Lunzer obtained in trade from [[Westminster Abbey]] in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finebooksmagazine.com/press/2015/12/daniel-bombergs-16th-century-talmud-sells-for-93-million-at-sothebys-ny.phtml Fine Books Magazine], accessed 5 January 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tablet&gt;{{cite web|title=Tablet Magazine|url=http://www.tabletmag.com/scroll/196121/new-york-businessman-leon-black-buy-bomberg-babylonian-talmud-for-9-3-million|accessdate=23 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2017, the collection was sold to the [[National Library of Israel]] in January 2017 through a private sale arranged by Sotheby's.&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt; David Blumberg, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the [[National Library of Israel]], said:&lt;blockquote&gt;“''The Valmadonna Trust Library represents an historic addition to our leading collection of Jewish manuscripts, prints and books, which reflect and embody the cultures of the Jewish people around the world and across the ages''”.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The Valmadonna Trust Library will be housed in the National Library of Israel's landmark new building in Jerusalem, due to open to the public in 2020.[https://worldisraelnews.com/national-library-gets-finest-collection-of-hebrew-prints-and-manuscripts/]
