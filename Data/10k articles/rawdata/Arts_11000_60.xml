'''''14 Women''''' is a 2007 [[documentary film]] directed by [[Mary Lambert (director)|Mary Lambert]] and narrated by [[Annette Bening]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fennessy|first=K.|title=14 Women (review)|journal=Video Librarian|date=Jan–Feb 2009|volume=24|issue=1|page=55|url=http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/entertainment-reviews/36297122/14-women|accessdate=23 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film released on June 14, 2007, and focuses on several female Senators serving in the [[109th United States Congress]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Akers|first=Mary Ann|title=Like a Prayer: 14 Women (and Joe Biden)|url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/sleuth/2007/06/like_a_prayer_14_women_and_joe.html|publisher=Washington Post|accessdate=23 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
The film examines the [[109th United States Congress]]. When it convened, there were fourteen women in the Senate: [[Barbara Boxer]], [[Maria Cantwell]], [[Hillary Clinton]], [[Susan Collins]], [[Elizabeth Dole]], [[Dianne Feinstein]], [[Kay Bailey Hutchison]], [[Mary Landrieu]], [[Blanche Lincoln]], [[Barbara Mikulski]], [[Lisa Murkowski]], [[Patty Murray]], [[Olympia Snowe]], and [[Debbie Stabenow]]. The documentary features interviews with several people, including the Senators' family members, Delaware Senator [[Joe Biden]], and singer [[Alanis Morissette]].

==Reception==
[[Politico.com]] and [[DVD Talk]] both gave positive reviews for ''14 Women'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=ANDREWS|first=HELENA|title='14 Women' and some wise little girls|url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0607/4544.html|publisher=Politico.com|accessdate=23 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; with DVD Talk commented that while it was "far from definitive", the film has "admirable aims and will probably play well with schoolkids."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jones|first=Preston|title=14 Women (review)|url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/34619/14-women/|publisher=DVD Talk|accessdate=23 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' gave a more mixed response to the film, saying that "Political junkies, idealistic schoolgirls and everyone in between will be thrilled to vary-ing degrees" by the movie but that it also felt like a "recruitment vid for public service".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cockrell|first=Eddie|title=Review: ‘Fourteen Women’|url=https://variety.com/2007/film/reviews/fourteen-women-1200558314/|publisher=Variety|accessdate=23 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Abraham Joseph Berline''' (6 October 1893 &amp;ndash; 1942) was a [[Russia]]n artist who lived in [[Paris]] and died during [[World War II]].

Abraham Joseph Berline was born on October 6, 1893, in [[Nizhyn]], [[Russian Empire]] (currently in [[Ukraine]]). He was the son of Leib Berline and Hana Kaganoff. In 1912, at the age of 19, he emigrated to Paris to study at the [[Ecole des Beaux Arts]]. He supported himself by driving a taxi and every place he saw figured in his landscapes. His work was highly regarded and exhibited at the most prestigious Parisian salons: [[Salon d'Automne]], [[Salon des Indépendants]], [[Salon des Tuileries]], the [[Paul Appel Gallery]], and in private galleries.

When [[France]] was invaded, Berline joined the [[Resistance during World War II|Resistance]], but in May 1941 Berline was arrested in the Billet Vert operation and interned as a Russian Jew in [[Compiègne]] camp. He continued to produce work, mainly pastels, focusing on the beauty of nature, in an attempt to transcend the camp experience through art. These paintings were shown in the camp along with other artists' work. After seven months he was transferred to [[Drancy internment camp]], and from there to [[Auschwitz]], as was his wife Doucia—never to return. His works are included in the art collection of the  [[Ghetto Fighters' House|Ghetto Fighters' House Museum]] and the [[Musée d'Histoire Contemporaine]] in Paris.

[[Image:Acqua_di_Parma_Colonia_.jpg|thumb|right|Acqua di Parma]]
'''Acqua di Parma''' is an [[Culture of Italy|Italian]] lifestyle and fashion company that produces [[fragrance]]s, [[candle]]s, [[bathrobe]]s and [[leather]] accessories. All of its ranges are  exclusively [[made in Italy]], and distributed in 43 countries.

==History==
The company's original fragrance, Colonia, was created in 1916 in a small [[perfume]] factory in the center of [[Parma]]'s historic old town, after which the company is named.

At the time, the majority of commercial perfumes were much stronger and heavier in composition; so the unusually light and refreshing fragrance from Parma found wide success in Europe.

In the 1930s the increasing popularity of the cologne led to an increase in production and the development of its distribution. The thirties and fifties are described as a 'golden age' for Acqua di Parma Colonia, which became very successful among members of high society, with celebrity clientele.

Over the years, the brand expanded its product range, introducing a home collection that includes bathrobes and towels, and leather goods.

In 1993 the brand was revived by entrepreneurs [[Luca di Montezemolo]] (former chairman of [[Ferrari]]), [[Diego Della Valle]] (President and CEO of [[Tod's]], (a shoeware and leather company)) and [[Paolo Borgomanero]] (a major shareholder of lingerie retailer [[La Perla (clothing)|La Perla]]).

In 1998 Acqua di Parma opened its first boutique on Milan's Via del Gesù (in the [[Quadrilatero della moda]] district), followed by Paris’s Rue des Francs Bourgeois in [[Le Marais]] in 2012, Rome’s [[Piazza di Spagna]] in 2014, and Miami's [[Brickell City Centre]] in 2017.

The company was  acquired by multi-national [[LVMH]] in 2001,&lt;ref&gt;Acqua di Parma S.r.l. [http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=29412828 Company Overview] on [[Bloomberg BusinessWeek]]&lt;/ref&gt; and is now headquartered in [[Milan]].

In May 2008 the company entered the luxury spa market with the Blu Mediterraneo Spa in [[Porto Cervo]] ([[Sardinia]]). In 2013 the company opened its second spa at the Gritti Palace in [[Venice]].

In 2013, the company launched La Nobiltà del Fare (“The Nobility of Work”), a book focusing on stories of Italian arts and crafts excellence, featuring photography by Giovanni Gastel.

The '''Alliance for Young Artists &amp; Writers''', a 501(c)(3) [[nonprofit organization]] established in 1994, identifies teenagers with exceptional creative talent and brings their remarkable work to a national audience through the Scholastic Art &amp; Writing Awards. The Alliance partners with nearly 100 Regional Affiliates across the country to provide creative teens with opportunities for recognition, exhibition, publication, and scholarships.

==Scholastic Art &amp; Writing Awards==
The Scholastic Art &amp; Writing Awards provide scholarships for teenagers in the United States. The Awards program was created in 1923 by Maurice R. "Robbie" Robinson, founder of [[Scholastic Corporation]], and has been administered by the Alliance for Young Artists &amp; Writers since 1994. Its past award recipients include [[Andy Warhol]], [[Frances Farmer]], [[wikipedia:Hughie_Lee-Smith|Hughie Lee-Smith]], [[Cy Twombly]], [[wikipedia:Charles_Wilbert_White|Charles White]], [[Sylvia Plath]], [[Truman Capote]], [[Richard Avedon]], [[Richard Linklater]], [[Stephen King]], [[John Updike]], [[Ken Burns]], [[Lena Dunham]], [[Paul Chan (artist)|Paul Chan]], [[Kay WalkingStick]], [[Zac Posen]] and [[Joyce Carol Oates]] among many others.

Established to ensure that literary and artistic talent were recognized in schools and communities across the country, the program began as a small writing contest; today, it offers recognition in 29 categories including architecture, sculpture, painting, photography, poetry, dramatic script, fashion, animation, and video games. The Awards are open to all students in grades 7&amp;ndash;12 from public, private, and home schools throughout the U.S. (and its territories), as well as American-run schools abroad and community programs serving eligible student populations.

==National Student Poets Program==
The program links the National Student Poets with audiences and neighborhood resources such as museums and libraries, and other community-anchor institutions and builds upon the Alliance for Young Artists &amp; Writers' long-standing work with educators and creative teens through the prestigious Scholastic Art &amp; Writing Awards. The Poets’ appointment events are hosted in cooperation with the [[Library of Congress]] in Washington, D.C., and held in conjunction with the [[National Book Festival]].

==Jurors==
The selection panels for both regional and national levels of the Scholastic Art &amp; Writing Awards are composed of artists&lt;ref name="New Yorker"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/03/24/teen-beat-2|title=Tean beat|last=Allen|first=Emma|date=March 24, 2014|website=The New Yorker|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=August 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;, writers, curators, critics, educators, and professionals from the nation’s leading creative industries&lt;ref name="New Yorker" /&gt;, some of whom are alums of the Scholastic Awards. Notable past jurors include [[Robert Frost]], [[Langston Hughes]], [[David Sedaris]], [[Judy Blume]], [[Bill Murray]], [[Philip-Lorca diCorcia]], [[Mary Ellen Mark]], [[William Saroyan]], [[Sergio Troncoso]], [[Frank McCourt]], [[Kiki Smith]], [[George Plimpton]], [[Esmeralda Santiago]], [[Princess Tatiana von Fürstenberg]], [[Madeleine L’Engle]], [[Faith Ringgold]], [[Billy Collins]], [[Edward Sorel]], Edwidge Danticat, [[Donald Lipski]], Carolyn Forché, [[Ned Vizzini]], and [[Michael Bierut]]. Panelists look for works that best exemplify originality, technical skill, and the emergence of a personal voice or vision.

'''Anglo-Saxon art''' covers art produced within the [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] period of English history, beginning with the [[Migration period art|Migration period]] style that the Anglo-Saxons brought with them from the continent in the 5th century, and ending in 1066 with the [[Norman Conquest]] of a large Anglo-Saxon nation-state whose sophisticated art was influential in much of northern Europe.  The two periods of outstanding achievement were the 7th and 8th centuries, with the metalwork and jewellery from [[Sutton Hoo]] and a series of magnificent illuminated manuscripts, and the final period after about 950, when there was a revival of English culture after the end of the [[Viking]] invasions.  By the time of the Conquest the move to the [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] style is nearly complete.  The important artistic centres, in so far as these can be established, were concentrated in the extremities of England, in [[Northumbria]], especially in the early period, and [[Wessex]] and [[Kent]] near the south coast.

Anglo-Saxon art survives mostly in [[illuminated manuscripts]], [[Anglo-Saxon architecture]], a number of very fine [[ivory]] carvings, and some works in metal and other materials. [[Opus Anglicanum]] ("English work") was already recognised as the finest embroidery in Europe, although only a few pieces from the Anglo-Saxon period remain – the [[Bayeux Tapestry]] is a rather different sort of embroidery, on a far larger scale. As in most of Europe at the time, metalwork was the most highly regarded form of art by the Anglo-Saxons, but hardly any survives – there was enormous plundering of Anglo-Saxon churches, monasteries and the possessions of the dispossessed nobility by the new Norman rulers in their first decades, as well as the Norsemen before them, and the [[English Reformation]] after them, and most survivals were once on the continent.&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell (1982)'s Chapter 1 gives a detailed analysis of the various causes of destruction of works of art, especially metalwork&lt;/ref&gt; Anglo-Saxon taste favoured brightness and colour, and an effort of the imagination is often needed to see the excavated and worn remains that survive as they once were.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 10–11; Dodwell (1982), chapter 2&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps the best known piece of Anglo-Saxon art is the Bayeux Tapestry which was commissioned by a [[Anglo-Normans|Norman]] patron from English artists working in the traditional Anglo-Saxon style. Anglo-Saxon artists also worked in [[fresco]], [[stone carving|stone]], [[ivory carving|ivory]] and [[bone carving|whalebone]] (notably the [[Franks Casket]]), [[metalwork]] (for example the [[Fuller brooch]]), [[Anglo-Saxon glass|glass]] and [[Vitreous enamel|enamel]], many examples of which have been recovered through [[archaeology|archaeological]] excavation and some of which have simply been preserved over the centuries, especially in churches on the Continent, as the [[Viking]]s, [[Normans]] and [[English Reformation|Reformation]] [[iconoclasm]] between them left virtually nothing in England except for books and archaeological finds.

==Overview==
[[File:Brit Mus 17sept 079.jpg|thumb|Bird from the Sutton Hoo shield (part replica)]]
Metalwork is almost the only form in which the earliest Anglo-Saxon art has survived, mostly in Germanic-style jewelry (including fittings for clothes and weapons) which was, before the [[Christianization of Anglo-Saxon England]], commonly placed in burials.&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell (1982), 3–4&lt;/ref&gt; After the conversion, which took most of the 7th century, the fusion of Germanic Anglo-Saxon, [[Celtic art|Celtic]] and Late Antique techniques and motifs, together with the requirement for books, created [[Hiberno-Saxon]] style, or [[Insular art]], which is also seen in illuminated manuscripts and some carved stone and ivory, probably mostly drawing from decorative metalwork motifs, and with further influences from the British Celts of the west and the [[Franks]].  The [[Kingdom of Northumbria]] in the far north of England was the crucible of Insular style in Britain, at centres such as [[Lindisfarne]], founded c. 635 as an offshoot of the [[Celtic Christianity|Irish monastery]] on [[Iona Abbey|Iona]], and [[Monkwearmouth-Jarrow Abbey]] (674) which looked to the continent.  At about the same time as the Insular [[Lindisfarne Gospels]] was being made in the early 8th century, the [[Vespasian Psalter]] from [[Canterbury]] in the far south, which the missionaries from Rome had made their headquarters, shows a wholly different, classically based art. These two styles mixed and developed together and by the following century the resulting Anglo-Saxon style had reached maturity.

However Anglo-Saxon society was massively disrupted in the 9th century, especially the later half, by the [[Viking]] invasions, and the number of significant objects surviving falls considerably, and their dating becomes even vaguer than of those from a century before. Most monasteries in the north were closed for decades, if not forever, and after the [[Canterbury Bible]] of before 850, perhaps well before, "no major [[illuminated manuscript]] is known until well on into the tenth century".&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 142 (quote), 60&lt;/ref&gt; [[King Alfred]] (r. 871–899) held the Vikings back to a line running diagonally across the middle of England, above which they settled in the [[Danelaw]], and were gradually integrated into what was now a unified Anglo-Saxon kingdom.  The final phase of Anglo-Saxon art is known as the Winchester School or style, though it was produced in many centres in the south of England, and perhaps the Midlands also.  Elements of this begin to be seen from around 900, but the first major manuscripts only appear around the 930s. The style combined influences from the continental art of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] with elements of older English art, and some particular elements including a nervous agitated style of drapery, sometimes matched by figures, especially in line drawings, which are the only images in many manuscripts, and were to remain especially prominent in medieval English art.

==Illuminated manuscripts==
[[File:CodexAureusCanterburyFolios9v10r.jpg|thumb|400px|left|The [[evangelist portrait]] and Incipit to Matthew from the [[Stockholm Codex Aureus]], one of the "Tiberius group", show the Northumbrian Insular and classicising continental styles that combined and competed in early Anglo-Saxon manuscripts.]] 
Early Anglo-Saxon manuscript illumination forms part of [[Insular art]], a combination of influences from Mediterranean, [[Celtic art|Celtic]] and [[Migration Period art|Germanic]] styles that arose when the Anglo-Saxons encountered Irish missionary activity in [[Northumbria]], at [[Lindisfarne]] and [[Iona]] in particular.  At the same time the [[Gregorian mission]] from Rome and its successors imported continental manuscripts like the Italian [[St. Augustine Gospels]], and for a considerable period the two styles appear mixed in a variety of proportions in Anglo-Saxon manuscripts. In the [[Lindisfarne Gospels]], of around 700–715, there are carpet pages and Insular initials of unprecedented complexity and sophistication, but the [[evangelist portrait]]s, clearly following Italian models, greatly simplify them, misunderstand some details of the setting, and give them a border with interlace corners.  The portrait of St Matthew is based on the same Italian model, or one extremely similar, used for the figure of [[Ezra]] that is one of the two large miniatures in the [[Codex Amiatinus]] (before 716), but the style there is very different; a far more illusionistic treatment, and an "attempt to introduce a pure Mediterranean style into Anglo-Saxon England", which failed, as "perhaps too advanced", leaving these images apparently as the only evidence.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 40, 49 (quote)&lt;/ref&gt;

A different mixture is seen in the opening from the [[Stockholm Codex Aureus]] (mid-8th century, left) where the evangelist portrait to the left is in a consistent adaptation of Italian style, probably closely following some lost model, though adding interlace to the chair frame, while the text page to the right is mainly in Insular style, especially in the first line, with its vigorous Celtic spirals and interlace.  The following lines revert to a quieter style more typical of [[Franks|Frankish]] manuscripts of the period.  Yet the same artist almost certainly produced both pages, and is very confident in both styles; the evangelist portrait of John includes roundels with Celtic spiral decoration probably drawn from the enamelled escutcheons of [[hanging bowl]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Nordenfalk, 96–107, Wilson 94&lt;/ref&gt; This is one of the so-called "Tiberius group" of manuscripts, which leant towards the Italian style, and appear to be associated with [[Kent]], or perhaps the kingdom of [[Mercia]] in the heyday of the [[Mercian Supremacy]].  It is, in the usual chronology, the last English manuscript in which "developed trumpet spiral patterns" are found.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 94&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Meister des Evangeliums des Grimbald 001.jpg|thumb|270px|Evangelist portrait from the [[Grimbald Gospels]], early 11th century, in the late Winchester style.]]

The 9th century, especially the latter half, has very few major survivals made in England, but was a period when Insular and Anglo-Saxon influence on [[Carolingian art|Carolingian]] manuscripts was at its height, from [[scriptoria]] such as those at the [[Anglo-Saxon mission]]'s foundation at [[Abbey of Echternach|Echternach Abbey]] (though the important [[Echternach Gospels]] were created in Northumbria), and the major monastery at [[Tours]], where [[Alcuin of York]] was followed by another Anglo-Saxon abbot, between them covering the period from 796 to 834.  Although Tours' own library was destroyed by Norsemen, over 60 9th century illuminated manuscripts from the ''scriptorium'' survive, in a style showing many borrowings from English models, especially in initial pages, where Insular influence remained visible in northern France until even the 12th century. The Anglo-Saxon metalwork produced in the [[Salzburg]] area of modern [[Austria]] has a manuscript counterpart in the "Cutbercht Gospels" in Vienna.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 131–133; Henderson, 63–71&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 10th century Insular elements were relegated to decorative embellishments in England, as the first phase of the "[[Winchester]] style" developed.&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell (1993), 90&lt;/ref&gt; The first plant ornament, with leaves and grapes, was already seen in an initial in the [[Leningrad Bede]], which can probably be dated to 746. The other large initial in the manuscript is the first [[historiated initial]] (one containing a portrait or scene, here Christ or a saint) in the whole of Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 63&lt;/ref&gt; The classically derived vine or plant scroll was to largely oust interlace as the dominant filler of ornamental spaces in Anglo-Saxon art, just as it did in much of Europe beginning with [[Carolingian art]], though in England animals within the scrolls remained much more common than abroad.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 63–67&lt;/ref&gt; For some long time scrolls, especially in metal, bone or ivory, are prone to have an animal head at one end and a plant element at the other.&lt;ref&gt;Seen by Wilson, 64–67, as "degeneration", this might also be seen as a return to the habits of [[La Tène style]].&lt;/ref&gt; All these changes were not restricted to manuscripts, and may not have been driven by manuscript style, but we have a greater number of manuscripts surviving than works in other media, even if in most cases illuminations are restricted to initials and perhaps a few miniatures.  Several ambitious projects of illumination are unfinished, such as the [[Old English Hexateuch]], which has some 550 scenes in various stages of completion, giving insight into working methods. The illustrations give Old Testament scenes an entirely contemporary setting and are valuable images of Anglo-Saxon life.&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell (1993), 118–120&lt;/ref&gt;

Manuscripts from the Winchester School or style only survive from about the 930s onwards; this coincided with a [[English Benedictine Reform|wave of revival and reform]] within English monasticism, encouraged by King [[Æthelstan]] (r. 924/5-939) and his successors.  Æthelstan promoted [[Dunstan]] (909–988), a practising illuminator, eventually to [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], and also [[Æthelwold of Winchester|Æthelwold]] and the French-trained Norseman [[Oswald of Worcester|Oswald]].  Illumination in a new style appears in a manuscript of the biographies by Bede of St [[Cuthbert]] given by Æthelstan to the monastery in [[Chester-le-Street]] about 937.  There is a [[dedication portrait]] of the king presenting his book to the saint, the two of them standing outside a large church.  This is the first real portrait of an English king, and heavily influenced by Carolingian style, with an elegant inhabited acanthus border.  However, the initials in the text combine Carolingian elements with animal forms in inventive fashion.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 156–157; Dodwell (1993), 95–96&lt;/ref&gt; Miniatures added in England to the continental Aethelstan Psalter begin to show Anglo-Saxon liveliness in figure drawing in compositions derived from Carolingian and Byzantine models, and over the following decades the distinctive Winchester style with agitated draperies and elaborate acanthus borders develops.&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell (1993), 96–104&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Benedictional of St. Æthelwold]] is a masterpiece of the later Winchester style, which drew on Insular, Carolingian, and [[Byzantine art]] to make a heavier and more grandiose style, where the broad classicising [[acanthus (ornament)|acanthus]] foliage sometimes seems over-luxuriant.  Anglo-Saxon illustration included many lively pen drawings, on which the Carolingian [[Utrecht Psalter]], in Canterbury from about 1000, was highly influential; the [[Harley Psalter]] is a copy of it. The [[Ramsey Psalter]] (c. 990) contains pages in both the painted and tinted drawing styles, including the first [[Beatus initial]] with a "lion mask", while the [[Tiberius Psalter]], from the last years before the Conquest, uses mainly the tinted.  Anglo-Saxon culture was coming into increasing contact with, and exchanging influences with, a wider Latin Mediaeval Europe. Anglo-Saxon drawing had a great influence in Northern France throughout the 11th century, in the so-called "Channel school", and Insular decorative elements such as [[interlace (art)|interlace]] remained popular into the 12th century in the [[Franco-Saxon]] style.

== Metalwork ==
[[File:Belt buckle.jpg|thumb|left|320px|[[Sutton Hoo]], gold and [[niello]] belt buckle]]
Pagan Anglo-Saxon metalwork initially uses the Germanic [[Animal Style]] I and II decoration that would be expected from recent immigrants, but gradually develops a distinctive Anglo-Saxon character, as in the [[Quoit Brooch Style]] of the 5th century. Round disk brooches were preferred for the grandest pieces, over continental styles of ''[[Fibula (brooch)|fibulae]]'' and Romano-British [[penannular brooch]]es, a consistent Anglo-Saxon taste throughout the period; the [[Harford Farm Brooch]] is a 7th-century example.  Decoration included [[cloisonné]] ("cellwork"), in gold and [[garnet]] for high-status pieces.  Despite a considerable number of other finds, the discovery of the ship-burial at [[Sutton Hoo]], probably interred in the 620s, transformed the history of Anglo-Saxon art, showing a level of sophistication and quality that was wholly unexpected at this date.  The most famous finds are the [[Sutton Hoo helmet|helmet]] and matching suite of [[Sutton Hoo purse-lid|purse-lid]], belt and other fittings of the king buried there, which made clear the source in Anglo-Saxon art, previously much disputed, of many elements of the style of Insular manuscripts.        
[[File:Brit Mus Fuller Brooch.jpg|thumb|The [[Fuller Brooch]]]]

By the 10th century Anglo-Saxon metalwork had a famous reputation as far afield as Italy, where English goldsmiths worked on plate for the altar of [[Old St. Peter's Basilica|St Peter's]] itself,&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 135 for St Peter's; Dodwell (1982) as next ref. for the reputation.&lt;/ref&gt; but hardly any pieces have survived the depredations of the [[Norman Conquest]] in 1066, and the [[English Reformation]], and none of the large-scale ones, shrines, doors and statues, that we know existed, and of which a few contemporary continental examples have survived.&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell (1982):10–11, 44–47, 61–83, 216ff&lt;/ref&gt; The references to specific works by the 11th century monastic artist [[Spearhafoc]], none of which have identifiably survived, are about works in precious metal, and he is one of a small number of metalwork artists from the period whose name we know and whose work is described in any way. According to several sources, including the [[Normans|Norman]] chronicler [[Goscelin]], who knew him personally, Spearhafoc "was outstanding in painting, gold-engraving and goldsmithery", the painting very likely mainly in [[illuminated manuscript]]s. It was probably his artistic work which brought into contact with the royal family, and launched his rapid promotion in the church.&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell (1982):46 and 55, who quotes Goscelin, and Historia:ciii-cv for the other sources.&lt;/ref&gt; Even the imprecise details given, mostly by Goscelin, are therefore valuable evidence of what Anglo-Saxon metalwork was like. Anglo-Saxon skill in gold-engraving, designs and figures engraved on gold objects, is mentioned by many foreign sources, and the few remaining engraved figures closely parallel the far more numerous pen-drawn figures in manuscripts, also an Anglo-Saxon speciality. Wall-paintings, which seem to have sometimes contained gold, were also apparently often made by manuscript illuminators, and Goscelin's description of his talents therefore suggests an artist skilled in all the main Anglo-Saxon media for figurative art – of which being a goldsmith was then regarded as the most prestigious branch.&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell (1982):58, 79–83, 92–3&lt;/ref&gt; One 11th century lay goldsmith was even a ''[[thegn]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 14&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Brit Mus 17sept 005-crop.jpg|thumb|left|Brooch from the [[Pentney Hoard]], in the Trewhiddle style.]]

Many monastic artists reached senior positions; Spearhafoc's career in metalwork was paralleled in less sensational fashion by his contemporary [[Mannig]], [[Abbot of Evesham]] (Abbot 1044–58, d. 1066),&lt;ref&gt;See Dodwell (1982), passim&lt;/ref&gt; and at the end of the previous century Saint [[Dunstan]] had been a very successful Archbishop of Canterbury. Like Spearhafoc, Mannig's biography, with some precise details, is given in the chronicle maintained by his abbey.&lt;ref&gt;Gransden:65. History&lt;/ref&gt; His work also had a miracle associated with it – the lay goldsmith Godric stabbed his hand with an [[scratch awl|awl]] during the work on the large shrine at Evesham, which was miraculously healed overnight.&lt;ref&gt;History:159 and Dodwell (1982):65–66&lt;/ref&gt; Spearhafoc and Mannig are the "only two goldsmiths of whom we have extended accounts", and the additional information given about Godric, the leader of a team brought in by Mannig for the shrine, is also unique among the surviving evidence. Some twenty years after the miracle, he joined the Abbey of Evesham, presumably in retirement, and his son later became [[Prior]] there.&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell (1982):48, 80 and 65–67&lt;/ref&gt;

In the final century of the period some large figures in precious metal are recorded; presumably these were made of thin sheets over a wooden core like the [[Golden Madonna of Essen]], the largest example of this type of Early Medieval figure to survive from anywhere in Europe. These appear to have been life-size, or nearly so, and were mostly [[crucifix]]es, sometimes with figures of Mary and [[John the Evangelist]] on either side. Patronage by the great figures of the land, and the largest monasteries, became extravagant in this period, and the greatest late Anglo-Saxon churches must have presented a dazzling spectacle, somewhat in the style of [[Eastern Orthodox]] churches. Anglo-Saxon taste revelled in expensive materials and the effects of light on precious metals, which were also embroidered into fabrics and used on wall-paintings.&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell (1982), Chapter 2&lt;/ref&gt; Sections of decorated elements from some large looted works such as reliquaries were sawn up by Viking raiders and taken home to their wives to wear as jewellery, and a number of these survive in Scandinavian museums.
[[File:Flickr - portableantiquities - Hilt Fitting.jpg|thumb|300px|Gold and [[garnet]] [[cloisonné]] (and mud); military fitting from the [[Staffordshire Hoard]] before cleaning.]]

While larger works are all lost, several small objects and fragments have survived, nearly all having been buried; in recent decades professional archaeology as well as [[metal-detecting]] and deep ploughing have greatly increased the number of objects known.  Among the few unburied exceptions are the secular [[Fuller Brooch]], and two works made in Anglo-Saxon style carried to Austria by the [[Anglo-Saxon mission]], the [[Tassilo Chalice]] (late 8th century) and the [[Rupertus Cross]].  Especially in the 9th century, Anglo-Saxon styles, sometimes derived from manuscripts rather than metal examples, are found in a great number of smaller pieces of jewellery and other small fittings from across northern Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 9, 133–137&lt;/ref&gt; From England itself, the [[Alfred Jewel]], with an enamel face, is the best known of a group of finely worked liturgical jewels, and there are a number of high quality disk brooches.  The most ornate of earlier ones are colourful and complicated with inlays and filigrees, but the 9th century [[Pentney Hoard]], discovered in 1978, contained six splendid brooches in flat silver openwork in the "[[Trewhiddle]] style".  In these small but fully formed animals, of no recognisable species, contort themselves in foliage and tendrils that interlace, but without the emphatic geometry of the earlier "ribbon" style.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/pe_mla/s/pentney_hoard_brooches.aspx British Museum] Six disc brooches from the Pentney hoard&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ædwen's brooch]], an 11th-century [[Anglo-Scandinavian]] silver disk brooch, shows influence from [[Viking art]], and a fall-off from the highest earlier standards of workmanship.

In 2009 the [[Staffordshire hoard]], a major hoard of over 1,500 fragments of 7th and ?8th century metalwork pieces, mostly gold and military in nature, many with gold and garnet cloisonné inlays of high quality, was found by a metal-detectorist in [[Staffordshire]], then in Mercia.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/highlights-of-anglosaxon-hoard-1792388.html Highlights of Anglo-Saxon hoard], [[The Independent]], 24 September 2009, (retrieved 24 September 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; Jewellery is far more often found from burials of the early pagan period, as Christianity discouraged grave-goods, even including the personal possessions of the deceased.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 12&lt;/ref&gt; Early Anglo-Saxon jewellery includes various types of ''fibulae'' that are close to their Continental Germanic equivalents, but until [[Sutton Hoo]] rarely of outstanding quality, which is why that find transformed thinking about early Anglo-Saxon art.

The earliest Anglo-Saxon coin type, the silver ''[[sceat]]'', forced craftsmen, no doubt asked to copy Roman and contemporary continental styles, to work outside their traditional forms and conventions in respect of the heads on the [[obverse]], with results that are varied and often compelling.  Later silver [[Penny (English coin)|pennies]], with largely linear relief heads of kings in profile on the obverse, are more uniform, as representatives of what was a stable and respected currency by contemporary European standards.&lt;ref&gt;Golden Age, 170–171&lt;/ref&gt; A number of complete ''[[seax]]'' knives have survived with inscriptions and some decoration, and sword fittings and other military pieces are an important form of jewellery.  A treatise on social status needed to say that mere ownership of a gilded sword did not make a man a ''[[ceorle]]'', the lowest rank of free men.&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell (1982), 190&lt;/ref&gt;

==Monumental sculpture and wall painting==
[[File:The 7th C Bewcastle Cross - geograph.org.uk - 1833413.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Bewcastle Cross]] ([[:File:The 7th C Bewcastle Cross (2) - geograph.org.uk - 1833421.jpg|alternative view]])]]
Apart from [[Anglo-Saxon architecture]], which survives entirely in churches, with only a handful of largely unaltered examples, monumental stone sculpture survives in large stone crosses, an equivalent to the [[high cross]]es of the Celtic areas of Britain. Most sculpture was probably once painted, clarifying the designs, which are mostly in relatively low relief and not finished with great precision, and now almost all badly worn and weathered.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 152 and passim.&lt;/ref&gt; Dating is usually difficult.  Sculpture in wood was very likely more common, but almost the only significant large survival is [[St Cuthbert's coffin]] in [[Durham Cathedral]], probably made in 698, with numerous linear images carved or incised in a technique that is a sort of large-scale engraving.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 50–53&lt;/ref&gt; The material of the earliest recorded crosses is unknown, but may well have been wood. From various references (to its destruction by Christians) there would seem to have been a tradition of Anglo-Saxon pagan monumental sculpture, probably in wood, of which no examples remain (as opposed to later [[Anglo-Scandinavian]] pagan imagery),&lt;ref&gt;No unmixed examples, that is to say. Scenes from Germanic mythology still appear in works of the Christian period, as in the Franks Casket and Gosforth Cross.&lt;/ref&gt; and with which the crosses initially competed.

The Anglo-Saxon crosses have survived less well than those in Ireland, being more subject to [[iconoclasm]] after the [[English Reformation]]. Some featured large figurative sculpture of considerable quality, as on the [[Ruthwell Cross]] and [[Bewcastle Cross]] (both probably around 800). Vine-scroll decoration and [[interlace (visual arts)|interlace]] are seen in alternating panels on the early Northumbrian Ruthwell, Bewcastle and [[Easby Cross]]es, though the vine-scroll is already more prominent, and has faces to itself. Later [[Southumbria]]n crosses often only use vine-scrolls.  There may be inscriptions, in the runic or Roman scripts, and Latin or [[Old English]], most famously at Ruthwell, where some of the poem the ''[[Dream of the Rood]]'' is inscribed together with Latin texts; more often donors are commemorated. It has also been suggested that as well as paint, they may have been embellished with metalwork and gems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sandbach.gov.uk/Guide/Crosses.htm Sanbach crosses]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Typically, Anglo-Saxon crosses are tall and slender compared to Irish examples, many with a nearly square section, and more space given to ornament than figures.  However, there are exceptions, like the massive [[Sandbach Crosses]] from Mercia, with oblong sections mostly covered by figures on the wider faces, like some Irish crosses.  The [[Gosforth Cross]], of 930–950, is a rare example to survive complete; most survivals are only a section of the shaft, and iconoclasts were more concerned to destroy imagery than ornament.  Many crosses must have just fallen over after some centuries; headpieces are the least common survivals, and the Easby Cross was repaired with lead in a way described in early documents.&lt;ref&gt;[https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O93731/stone-carving-the-easby-cross/ V&amp;A Museum], Easby Cross, A.88–1930&lt;/ref&gt; Like many monuments from the area of the [[Danelaw]], the Gosforth Cross combines Christian images with those from pagan mythology; apart from a Crucifixion scene, and perhaps scenes of the [[Last Judgment|Last Judgement]], all the other images appear to belong to the Norse myth of ''[[Ragnarök]]'', the destruction of the gods, a theme detected in other Christian monuments in Britain and Scandinavia, and which could be turned to Christian advantage.&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, 18–22; Wilson, 150&lt;/ref&gt;  
[[File:St Oswald's Priory Anglo-Saxon cross.jpg|thumb|Fragment of cross shaft from [[St Oswald's Priory, Gloucester]]; at right with added, but perhaps not inauthentic, colour.]]

Anglo-Scandinavians took up Anglo-Saxon sculptural forms with great enthusiasm, and in Yorkshire alone there are fragments from more than 500 monumental sculptures of the 10th and 11th centuries.  However quantity was not matched by quality, and even the products of the main city, York, are described by [[David M. Wilson]] as "generally miserable and slipshod".&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 142–152; 142 "more than 500; 144 (quote)&lt;/ref&gt; In the early stages the successive styles of [[Norse art]] appear in England, but gradually as political and cultural ties weakened the Anglo-Scandinavians fail to keep up with trends in the homeland. So elements of the [[Borre style]] are seen, for example in the "ring-chain" interlace on the Gosforth Cross, and then the complex animals of the [[Jelling style]] are mostly rather incompetently depicted in England, but traces of the next [[Mammen style]] are hard to detect; they are much clearer on the [[Isle of Man]].  They are "perhaps, dimly" evident in the cross shaft from [[St Oswald's Priory, Gloucester]] (illustrated right).  In general the traces of these styles in other media are even fainter.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 142–149, quote 147&lt;/ref&gt; A uniquely Anglo-Scandinavian form is the [[Hogback (sculpture)|hogback]], low grave-marker shaped like a long house with a pitched roof, and sometimes muzzled bears clutching on to each end.  Ornament is sometimes a crude pattern of scoring, or scale-like elements presumably representing roofing shingles, but may include interlace and images.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 149; Laing's typology is shown in 3 pages of drawings [http://www.dur.ac.uk/sculpturecorpus/Corpus_Website_Main_Folder/grammar_pages/Chapter2/Hogbacks.htm here] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121015224136/http://www.dur.ac.uk/sculpturecorpus/Corpus_Website_Main_Folder/grammar_pages/Chapter2/Hogbacks.htm |date=15 October 2012 }} from the ''AS Sculpture Corpus'' website; [http://www.nrk.no/kanal/nrk_p2/1.6781563 photo of good examples from Brompton, Yorkshire]&lt;/ref&gt;

Many fragments, parts of friezes and panels with figure and ornamental carving, have been recovered by archaeology, usually after being reused in rebuilt churches.  The largest group of Anglo-Saxon sculpture is from a former abbey at [[Breedon-on-the-Hill]] in Mercia, with a number of elements of different dates, including lively narrow decorative strip friezes, many including human figures, and panels with saints and the Virgin.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 80–81&lt;/ref&gt; The most intriguing fragments are firstly a group, now at [[Canterbury Cathedral]], from [[St Mary's Church, Reculver]], in Kent, from a large composition with many figure scenes and groups on a curved surface, evidently of high quality, though uncertain date (perhaps early 10th century).  A ''Sacrifice of Isaac'' and an ''Ascension'' can be identified, and parts of standing groups of saints, prophets or apostles.&lt;ref&gt;Golden Age, 40–41; Wilson, 70–72&lt;/ref&gt;

Standing equally apart from other survivals is a late slab from the [[Old Minster, Winchester]] which appears to show a section of a large frieze with the story from Germanic mythology of [[Sigmund]], which it has been suggested may have been as long as eighty feet wide, and over four feet high.  There are literary references to secular narrative tapestries, a tradition of which the [[Bayeux Tapestry]] is the only survival, and this may have been a stone equivalent, celebrating Sigmund, who was believed to be an ancestor of the intermarried royal houses of both England and [[Denmark]], many of whom were buried in what was then the largest church in England.&lt;ref&gt;Golden Age, 133–134; Dodwell (1982), 137–138; Henderson, 171–173&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also clear from literary sources that wall paintings were not uncommon, although not a prestigious form, and fragments of painted plaster have been found, as well as a painted face on a reused stone at [[Winchester]], dating to before 903, and so an important early example of the Winchester figure style.&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell (1982), 92–93; Wilson, 10–13, 155; Golden Age, 44&lt;/ref&gt; A metaphor in a letter of [[Alcuin]] speaks of "stars, like the painted ceiling of a great man's house".&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 131&lt;/ref&gt; However, no paintings that are at all complete have survived on either wall or panel.

==Ivory carving==
[[File:Brit Mus 17sept 010-crop.jpg|thumb|310px|Head of a [[tau cross]], with ''[[Christ Treading on the Beasts]]'', an especially popular subject in England]]
As in the rest of the Christian world, while monumental sculpture was slowly re-emerging from its virtual absence in the Early Christian period, small-scale sculpture in metalwork, [[ivory carving]] and also [[bone carving]] was more important than in later periods, and by no means a "minor art".  Most Anglo-Saxon ivory was from marine animals, especially the [[walrus]], imported from further north. The extraordinary early [[Franks Casket]] is carved from [[whalebone]], which a [[riddle]] on it alludes to. It contains a unique mixture of pagan, historical and Christian scenes, evidently attempting to cover a general history of the world, and inscriptions in [[rune]]s in both Latin and [[Old English]]. We have few Anglo-Saxon panels from book-covers compared to those from [[Carolingian art|Carolingian]] and [[Ottonian art]] but a number of figures of very high quality in high relief or fully in the round.  In the last phase of Anglo-Saxon art two styles are apparent: one a heavier and formal one drawing from Carolingian and Ottonian sources, and the other the Winchester style, drawing from the [[Utrecht Psalter]] and an alternative Carolingian tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Golden Age, 88&lt;/ref&gt; A very late [[buxus|boxwood]] casket, now in [[Cleveland, Ohio]], is carved all over with scenes from the ''[[Life of Christ]]'' in a provincial but accomplished version of the Winchester style, possibly originating in the [[West Midlands (region)|West Midlands]], and is a unique survival of late Anglo-Saxon fine wood carving.&lt;ref&gt;Golden Age, 125–126;[http://www.clevelandart.org/collections/collection%20online.aspx?pid={91ADCD8F-992A-45A5-8599-70835467DF5E}&amp;coid=5870087&amp;clabel=highlights Cleveland Museum of Art], Accession No.: 1953.362&lt;/ref&gt;

==Textile art==
[[File:Fleeing bayeux tapestry.png|thumb|left|The English army flee, the final surviving scene of the [[Bayeux Tapestry]].]]   
The textile arts of embroidery and "tapestry", ''[[Opus anglicanum]]'', were apparently those for which Anglo-Saxon England was famous throughout Europe by the end of the period, but there are only a handful of survivals, probably partly because of the Anglo-Saxon love of using threads in precious metal, making the work valuable for scrap.  

The [[Bayeux Tapestry]] is embroidered in wool on [[linen]] and shows the story of the [[Norman conquest of England]]; it is surely the best known Anglo-Saxon work of art, and though made after the Conquest was both made in England and firmly in an Anglo-Saxon tradition, points now accepted by French art-historians.&lt;ref&gt;Golden Age, 195; Dodwell (1982), 138–139. However a number of fringe theories persist – see the article. See also Henderson, 168–177 for an extended appreciation.&lt;/ref&gt; Such tapestries adorned both churches and wealthy houses in England, though at 0.5 by 68.38 metres (1.6 by 224.3&amp;nbsp;ft, and apparently incomplete) the Bayeux Tapestry must be exceptionally large.  Only the figures and decoration are embroidered, on a background left plain, which shows the subject very clearly and was necessary to cover very large areas. All kinds of textile arts were produced by women, both nuns and laywomen, but many were probably designed by artists in other media. [[Byzantine silk]]s were available, though certainly expensive, in Anglo-Saxon England, and a number of pieces have been found used in burials and reliquaries.  Probably, as in later vestments, these were often married with locally embroidered borders and panels. If we had more Anglo-Saxon survivals, Byzantine influences would no doubt be apparent.&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell (1982), Chapter V; Dodwell (1993), Chapter 2&lt;/ref&gt;

The most highly valued embroideries were very different, fully worked in silk and gold of silver thread, and sometimes with gems of various sorts sewn in. These were used for vestments, altar-cloths and other church uses, and similar roles in the homes of the elite. Only a few pieces have survived, including three pieces at Durham placed in the coffin of St Cuthbert, probably in the 930s, after being given by [[King Athelstan]]; they were made in Winchester between 909 and 916. These are works "of breathtaking brilliance and quality", according to Wilson, including figures of saints, and important early examples of the Winchester style, though the origin of their style is a puzzle; they are closest to the wall-painting fragment from Winchester mentioned above, and an early example of acanthus decoration.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 154–156, quote 155; Dodwell (1993), 26; Golden Age, 19, 44, though neither these nor any textiles could be lent for the exhibition; [https://trc-leiden.nl/trc-needles/individual-textiles-and-textile-types/religious-vestments-and-other-textiles/st-cuthbert-embroideries St. Cuthbert Embroideries], from Textile Research Centre, Leiden&lt;/ref&gt; 

The earliest group of survivals, now re-arranged and with the precious metal thread mostly picked out, are bands or borders from vestments, incorporating pearls and glass beads, with various types of scroll and animal decoration. These are probably 9th century and now in a church in [[Maaseik]] in Belgium.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 108; Dodwell (1993), 27, who gives details of further fragments.&lt;/ref&gt; A further style of textile is a vestment illustrated in a miniature portrait of [[Saint Aethelwold]] in his Benedictional (see above), which shows the edge of what appears to be a huge acanthus "flower" (a term used in several documentary records) covering the wearer's back and shoulders.  Other written sources mention other large-scale compositions.&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell (1982), 183–185; [http://img49.imageshack.us/img49/5295/benedictional1am1.jpg portrait of Saint Aethelwold]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other materials==
[[File:Claw beaker from Ringmere Farm BM 2005.12-5.1.jpg|thumb|230px|[[Claw beaker]] in glass]]
[[Anglo-Saxon glass]] was mostly made in simple forms, with vessels always in a single colour, either clear, green or brown, but some fancy [[claw beaker]]s decorated with large "claw" forms have survived, mostly broken; these forms are also found in northern continental Europe.  Beads, common in early female burials, and some ecclesiastical window glass was more brightly coloured, and several monastic sites have evidence of glass production.  Vessel and bead production probably continued, at a much lower level, from the Romano-British industry, but Bede records that [[Benedict Biscop]] brought glass-makers from [[Gaul]] for window glass at his monasteries.  It is not clear how much Anglo-Saxon glass was imported, but canes of [[millefiori]] coloured glass almost certainly were; one of these was in the purse at Sutton Hoo.  Otherwise recycling of Roman glass may have avoided the need to import raw glass; evidence for the production of this is slender.  Glass is sometimes used as a substitute for garnet in jewellery, as in some pieces from Sutton Hoo. [[Vitreous enamel|Enamel]] was used, most famously in the [[Alfred Jewel]], where the image sits under carved [[rock crystal]], both materials are extremely rare in surviving Anglo-Saxon work.

The unique decorated leather cover of the small Northumbrian [[St Cuthbert Gospel]], the oldest Western [[bookbinding]] to survive unaltered, can be dated to 698 or shortly before.  It uses incised lines, some colours, and relief decoration built up over cord and [[gesso]] or leather pieces. Larger prestige manuscripts had metalwork [[treasure binding]]s, several of which are mentioned, but there may well have been much decorated leatherwork for secular satchels, purses, belts and the like, which contemporaries did not bother to mention and which represents a gap in our knowledge for the Early Medieval period throughout Europe.

==Aftermath==
[[File:The St Cuthbert Gospel of St John. (formerly known as the Stonyhurst Gospel) is the oldest intact European book. - Upper cover (Add Ms 89000) (cropped).jpg|thumb|250px|left|The front cover of the [[St Cuthbert Gospel]], 690s; the original tooled red goatskin binding is the earliest surviving Western [[bookbinding]]]]

Relatively little art survives from the rest of the century after 1066, or at least is confidently dated to that period.  The art of Normandy was already under heavy Anglo-Saxon influence, but the period was one of massive despoliation of the churches by the small new ruling class, who had almost entirely dispossessed the old Anglo-Saxon elite. Under these circumstances little significant art was produced, but when it was, the style often showed a slow development of Anglo-Saxon styles into a fully Romanesque version.&lt;ref&gt;Zarnecki, 17–23, 83–84, 232&lt;/ref&gt; The attribution of many individual objects has jumped around across the boundary of the Norman Conquest, especially for sculpture, including ivories. A number of objects are claimed for their period by both the "Golden Age of Anglo-Saxon Art" and the "English Romanesque art: 1066–1200" exhibition catalogues, despite both being published in 1984.  These include the ivory triangle mount with angels and the "Sigurd" stone relief fragment (discussed above), both from Winchester, and the ivory "pen-case" and ''Baptism'' (illustrated above), both in the British Museum.&lt;ref&gt;Respectively numbers: Golden Age: 114, 140, 132, 117, and Zarnecki: 190, 97, 185, 180.  There are many other examples.&lt;/ref&gt;

The energy, love of complicated twining ornament, and refusal to wholly respect a dignified classical decorum that are displayed in both Insular and Winchester school art had already influenced continental style, as discussed above, where it provided an alternative to the heavy monumentality that [[Ottonian art]] displays even in small objects.  This habit of mind was an essential component of both the Romanesque and [[Gothic art|Gothic]] styles, where forms of Anglo-Saxon invention such as the inhabited and historiated initials became more important than they ever had in Anglo-Saxon art itself, and works like the [[Gloucester Candlestick]] (c. 1110) show the process in other media.&lt;ref&gt;Henderson, 63–71&lt;/ref&gt;

Anglo-Saxon [[iconography|iconographical]] innovations include the animal [[Hellmouth]], the [[Ascension of Christ|ascending Christ]] shown only as a pair of legs and feet disappearing at the top of the image, the horned [[Moses]], St [[John the Evangelist]] standing at the foot of the cross and writing, and [[God the Father]] creating the world with a [[pair of compasses]].  All of these were later used across Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell (1993), 117&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest developed depiction of the ''[[Last Judgement]]'' in the West is also found on an Anglo-Saxon ivory, and a late Anglo-Saxon Gospel book may show the earliest example of [[Mary Magdalene]] at the foot of the cross in a ''Crucifixion''.&lt;ref&gt;It is the earliest cited by Schiller, II, 117&lt;/ref&gt;

{{wiktionary|camaieu}}
'''Camaïeu''' (also called ''en camaïeu'') is a technique that employs two or three [[tint]]s of a single [[color]], other than gray, to create a [[monochromatic]] image without regard to local or realistic color. When a picture is monochromatically rendered in gray, it is called [[grisaille]]; when in yellow, [[cirage]].{{ref|reference1}}

The term is also applied to monochrome painting in enamels. This technique uses a buildup of white enamel to create highlights and light areas. However, instead of using a black background, as in grisaille, transparent enamel is laid in first, beneath the whites. This technique is frequently used on [[snuffbox]]es, watches and medallions.

''{{lang|fr|Camaïeu}}'' can also refer, following the French usage, to [[chiaroscuro]] [[woodcut]] [[old master print|prints]] that imitate highlighted drawing on tinted paper. However, the correct term in English for these is ''chiaroscuro woodcuts''.

This French word once was synonymous with ''[[cameo (carving)|cameo]]'', but its meaning became restricted in the early eighteenth century.{{ref|reference2}}

Camaïeu is also a registered trademark of a manufacturer.

[[Image:Kerk aldeneik.jpg|thumb|250px|Church of Saint Anne, Aldeneik]]
The '''Church of Saint Anne''' ([[Dutch language|Dutch]]: ''Sint-Annakerk'') is a partly [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]], partly [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] church in [[Aldeneik]], [[Belgium]].

==History==
Originally, the church was part of [[Aldeneik Abbey]], a Benedictine [[nunnery]], founded by the holy sisters [[Harlindis]] and [[Relindis]] on their father Adelard's estate in ''Eike'' (Aldeneik). In the 10th century, emperor [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto I]] donated the monastery to the [[Prince-Bishopric of Liège]] in order to prevent local nobleman from seizing control of the property. Shortly afterwards the nunnery was replaced by a [[Chapter (religion)|collegiate chapter]] of (male) [[canon (priest)|canons]], who in the 12th century built the Romanesque church which partly survives in the present building. Since the 16th century it has served as a [[Roman Catholic]] parish church. Originally dedicated to [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Saint Mary]], later to Mary and [[Saint Peter]], in the 18th century it was dedicated to [[Saint Anne]].

==Description church==
===Exterior===
The present church was partly built in the 12th century and consists of a 3-aisle [[basilica]] in [[Mosan art|Mosan style]], without [[transept]]s. In the 13th or 14th century the choir was replaced in [[Gothic architecture|Gothic style]]. After the chapter moved to Maaseik in 1571, the church became too big for the small congregation that continued to use it. The aisles were probably demolished shortly afterwards. Part of the [[westwork]] was also demolished or destroyed. In the 19th century the westwork was rebuilt, although it was not clear what the original westwork had looked like. The side aisles were rebuilt in the same period.

===Interior===
The nave is the best preserved part of the original interior of the church, although the wooden ceiling was renewed in the 19th century. The primitive red and ochre murals in the nave date from the 13th century and are among the oldest in Belgium. The choir is lit by two [[rose window]]s and five [[lancet window]]s.

'''Color motion picture film''' refers both to unexposed [[color photography|color photographic film]] in a format suitable for use in a [[Movie camera|motion picture camera]], and to finished motion picture [[film]], ready for use in a [[movie projector|projector]], which bears images in color.

The first color cinematography was by [[additive color]] systems such as the one patented by [[Edward Raymond Turner]] in 1899 and tested in 1902.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-19598445 "Martin Scorsese on world's first colour film discovery"]. BBC&lt;/ref&gt; A simplified additive system was successfully commercialised in 1909 as [[Kinemacolor]]. These early systems used black-and-white film to photograph and project two or more component images through different color [[filter (optics)|filters]].

Around 1920, the first practical [[subtractive color]] processes were introduced. These also used black-and-white film to photograph multiple color-filtered source images, but the final product was a multicolored print that did not require special projection equipment. Before 1932, when three-strip [[Technicolor]] was introduced, commercialized subtractive processes used only two color components and could reproduce only a limited range of color.

In 1935, [[Kodachrome]] was introduced, followed by [[Agfacolor]] in 1936. They were intended primarily for amateur [[home movies]] and "[[Reversal film|slides]]". These were the first films of the "integral tripack" type, coated with three layers of differently color-sensitive [[Photographic emulsion|emulsion]], which is usually what is meant by the words "color film" as commonly used. The few color films still being made in the 2010s are of this type. The first color [[negative (photography)|negative]] films and corresponding [[release print|print]] films were modified versions of these films. They were introduced around 1940 but only came into wide use for commercial motion picture production in the early 1950s. In the US, [[Eastman Kodak]]'s [[Eastmancolor]] was the usual choice, but it was often re-branded with another trade name, such as "WarnerColor", by the studio or the film processor.

Later color films were standardized into two distinct processes: [[Eastman Color Negative|Eastman Color Negative 2]] chemistry (camera negative stocks, duplicating interpositive and internegative stocks) and [[Eastman Color Positive|Eastman Color Positive 2]] chemistry (positive prints for direct projection), usually abbreviated as ECN-2 and ECP-2. Fuji's products are compatible with ECN-2 and ECP-2.

Film was the dominant form of cinematography until the 2010s, when it was largely replaced by [[digital cinematography]].&lt;ref name="indiewire"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiewire.com/article/as-studios-abandon-35-mm-film-small-theaters-struggle-to-transition-to-digital|title=Studios Abandon Film, Small Theaters Struggle -- And There's a Happy Ending|website=Indiewire|last1=Hurley|first1=Michael|date=2 January 2014|access-date=5 February 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160201064107/http://www.indiewire.com/article/as-studios-abandon-35-mm-film-small-theaters-struggle-to-transition-to-digital|archive-date=1 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The first motion pictures were photographed using a simple homogeneous [[photographic emulsion]] that yielded a [[black-and-white]] image—that is, an image in shades of gray, ranging from black to white, corresponding to the [[luminous intensity]] of each point on the photographed subject. Light, shade, form and movement were captured, but not color.

With color motion picture film, information about the [[color]] of the light at each image point is also captured. This is done by analyzing the [[visible spectrum]] of color into several regions (normally three, commonly referred to by their dominant colors: red, green and blue) and recording each region separately.

Current color films do this with three layers of differently color-sensitive photographic emulsion coated on one strip of [[film base]]. Early processes used color [[filter (optics)|filters]] to photograph the color components as completely separate images (e.g., three-strip [[Technicolor]]) or adjacent microscopic image fragments (e.g., [[Dufaycolor]]) in a one-layer black-and-white emulsion.

Each photographed color component, initially just a colorless record of the luminous intensities in the part of the spectrum that it captured, is processed to produce a transparent dye image in the color [[complementary color|complementary]] to the color of the light that it recorded. The superimposed dye images combine to synthesize the original colors by the [[subtractive color]] method. In some early color processes (e.g., [[Kinemacolor]]), the component images remained in black-and-white form and were projected through [[color filter]]s to synthesize the original colors by the [[additive color]] method.

==Tinting and hand coloring==
{{see also|List of early color feature films}}
The earliest motion picture stocks were [[orthochromatic]], and recorded blue and green light, but not red. Recording all three spectral regions required making film stock [[panchromatic]] to some degree. Since orthochromatic film stock hindered color photography in its beginnings, the first films with color in them used [[aniline]] dyes to create artificial color. Hand-colored films appeared in 1895 with [[Thomas Edison]]'s hand-painted ''Annabelle's Dance'' for his [[Kinetoscope]] viewers.

Many early filmmakers from the first ten years of film also used this method to some degree. [[George Méliès]] offered hand-painted prints of his own films at an additional cost over the black-and-white versions, including the visual-effects pioneering ''[[Le Voyage dans la Lune|A Trip to the Moon]]'' (1902). The film had various parts of the film painted frame-by-frame by twenty-one women in Montreuil&lt;ref name="history"&gt;David A. Cook, ''A History of Narrative Film'' (2nd edition, W. W. Norton &amp; Company, 1990).  {{ISBN|0-393-95553-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a production-line method.&lt;ref name="dictionary"&gt;Ira Konigsberg, ''The Complete Film Dictionary'' Meridan PAL Books, 1987)  {{ISBN|0-452-00980-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first commercially successful [[stencil]] color process was introduced in 1905 by [[Pathé Frères]]. ''Pathé Color'', renamed [[Pathéchrome]] in 1929, became one of the most accurate and reliable stencil coloring systems. It incorporated an original print of a film with sections cut by [[pantograph]] in the appropriate areas for up to six colors&lt;ref name="history" /&gt; by a coloring machine with dye-soaked, velvet rollers.&lt;ref name="encyclopedia"&gt;Ephraim Katz, ''The Film Encyclopedia'' (HarperCollins, 1994) {{ISBN|0-06-273089-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a stencil had been made for the whole film, it was placed into contact with the print to be colored and run at high speed (60 feet per minute) through the coloring (staining) machine. The process was repeated for each set of stencils corresponding to a different color. By 1910, Pathé had over 400 women employed as stencilers in their [[Vincennes]] factory.  Pathéchrome continued production through the 1930s.&lt;ref name="history" /&gt;

A more common technique emerged in the early 1910s known as '''[[film tinting]]''', a process in which either the emulsion or the [[film base]] is dyed, giving the image a uniform [[monochromatic]] color.  This process was popular during the silent era, with specific colors employed for certain narrative effects (red for scenes with fire or firelight, blue for night, etc.).&lt;ref name="dictionary" /&gt;

A complementary process, called '''toning''', replaces the [[silver]] particles in the film with metallic salts or [[mordant]]ed [[dye]]s.  This creates a color effect in which the dark parts of the image are replaced with a color (e.g., blue and white rather than black and white).  Tinting and toning were sometimes applied together.&lt;ref name="dictionary" /&gt;

In the United States, St. Louis engraver Max Handschiegl and cinematographer Alvin Wyckoff created the [[Handschiegl Color Process]], a dye-transfer equivalent of the stencil process, first used in ''[[Joan the Woman]]'' (1917) directed by [[Cecil B. DeMille]], and used in special effects sequences for films such as ''[[The Phantom of the Opera (1925 film)|The Phantom of the Opera]]'' (1925).&lt;ref name="history" /&gt;

[[Eastman Kodak]] introduced its own system of pre-tinted black-and-white film stocks called [[Sonochrome]] in 1929.  The Sonochrome line featured films tinted in seventeen different colors including Peachblow, Inferno, Candle Flame, Sunshine, Purple Haze, Firelight, Azure, Nocturne, Verdante, Aquagreen,&lt;ref name="readfilm" /&gt; Caprice, Fleur de Lis, Rose Doree, and the neutral-density Argent, which kept the screen from becoming excessively bright when switching to a black-and-white scene.&lt;ref name="history" /&gt;

Tinting and toning continued to be used well into the sound era.  In the 1930s and 1940s, some western films were processed in a sepia-toning solution to evoke the feeling of old photographs of the day. Tinting was used as late as 1951 for [[Sam Newfield]]'s sci-fi film ''[[Lost Continent (1951 film)|Lost Continent]]'' for the green lost-world sequences. [[Alfred Hitchcock]] used a form of hand-coloring for the orange-red gun-blast at the audience in ''[[Spellbound (1945 film)|Spellbound]]'' (1945).&lt;ref name="history" /&gt;  Kodak's Sonochrome and similar pre-tinted stocks were still in production until the 1970s and were used commonly for custom theatrical trailers and [[Snipe (theatrical)|snipes]].

In the last half of the 20th century, [[Norman McLaren]], who was one of the pioneers in animated movies, made several animated films in which he directly hand-painted the images, and in some cases, also the soundtrack, on each frame of the film. This approach was previously employed in the early years of movies, late 19th and early 20th century. One of the precursors in color hand painting frame by frame was the Aragonese Segundo de Chomon, that worked with Melies.

Tinting was gradually replaced by natural color techniques.

==Physics of light and color==
The principles on which [[color photography]] is based were first proposed by Scottish physicist [[James Clerk Maxwell]] in 1855 and presented at the [[Royal Society]] in London in 1861.&lt;ref name="history" /&gt;  By that time, it was known that [[light]] comprises a spectrum of different wavelengths that are perceived as different colors as they are absorbed and reflected by natural objects.  Maxwell discovered that all natural colors in this spectrum as perceived by the human eye may be reproduced with additive combinations of three [[primary color]]s—[[red]], [[green]], and [[blue]]—which, when mixed equally, produce white light.&lt;ref name="history" /&gt;

Between 1900 and 1935, dozens of natural color systems were introduced, although only a few were successful.&lt;ref name="readfilm"&gt;Monaco, James (1981) (Revised ed) ''How to Read a Film'' Oxford University Press.  {{ISBN|0-19-502806-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Additive color===
The first color systems that appeared in motion pictures were [[additive color]] systems.  Additive color was practical because no special color stock was necessary.  Black-and-white film could be processed and used in both filming and projection.  The various additive systems entailed the use of color [[filter (photography)|filters]] on both the movie camera and [[movie projector|projector]].  Additive color adds lights of the primary colors in various proportions to the projected image.  Because of the limited amount of space to record images on film, and later because the lack of a camera that could record more than two strips of film at once, most early motion-picture color systems consisted of two colors, often red and green or red and blue.&lt;ref name="dictionary" /&gt;

A pioneering three-color additive system was patented in England by [[Edward Raymond Turner]] in 1899.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=World's first colour moving pictures discovered|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-19423951l|newspaper=BBC News|date=12 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It used a rotating set of red, green and blue filters to photograph the three color components one after the other on three successive [[film frame|frame]]s of [[panchromatic]] black-and-white film. The finished film was projected through similar filters to reconstitute the color. In 1902, Turner shot test footage to demonstrate his system, but projecting it proved problematic because of the accurate registration (alignment) of the three separate color elements required for acceptable results. Turner died a year later without having satisfactorily projected the footage. In 2012, curators at the [[National Media Museum]] in Bradford, UK, had the original custom-format [[nitrate film]] copied to black-and-white 35&amp;nbsp;mm film, which was then scanned into a digital video format by [[telecine]]. Finally, [[digital image processing]] was used to align and combine each group of three frames into one color image.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brianpritchard.com/Lee_Turner_Project.htm Pritchard, B. (2012). "Lee-Turner Project with the National Media Museum".] Retrieved 20 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The result is that the whole world can now view brief motion pictures from 1902 in full color.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=World's first colour film unveiled|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/film-news/9538882/Worlds-first-colour-film-unveiled.html|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=12 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Practical color in the motion picture business began with [[Kinemacolor]], first demonstrated in 1906.&lt;ref name="encyclopedia" /&gt;  This was a two-color system created in England by [[George Albert Smith (inventor)|George Albert Smith]], and promoted by film pioneer [[Charles Urban]]'s The Charles Urban Trading Company in 1908.  It was used for a series of films including the documentary ''[[With Our King and Queen Through India]]'', depicting the [[Delhi Durbar]] (also known as ''The Durbar at Delhi'', 1912), which was filmed in December 1911. The Kinemacolor process consisted of alternating frames of specially sensitized black-and-white film exposed at 32 frames per second through a rotating filter with alternating red and green areas. The printed film was projected through similar alternating red and green filters at the same speed. A perceived range of colors resulted from the blending of the separate red and green alternating images by the viewer's persistence of vision.&lt;ref name="dictionary" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(1917) "Kinemacolor" ''How to Make and Operate Moving Pictures'' Funk &amp; Wagnalls. Courtesy of [http://www.widescreenmuseum.com Wide Screen Museum]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William Friese-Greene]] invented another additive color system called Biocolour, which was developed by his son [[Claude Friese-Greene]] after William's death in 1921.  William sued George Albert Smith, alleging that the Kinemacolor process infringed on the patents for his Bioschemes, Ltd.; as a result, Smith's patent was revoked in 1914.&lt;ref name="history" /&gt;  Both Kinemacolor and Biocolour had problems with "fringing" or "haloing" of the image, due to the separate red and green images not fully matching up.&lt;ref name="history" /&gt;

By their nature, these additive systems were very wasteful of light. Absorption by the color filters involved meant that only a minor fraction of the projection light actually reached the screen, resulting in an image that was dimmer than a typical black-and-white image. The larger the screen, the dimmer the picture. For this and other case-by-case reasons, the use of additive processes for theatrical motion pictures had been almost completely abandoned by the early 1940s, though additive color methods are employed by all the color [[video]] and computer display systems in common use today.&lt;ref name="dictionary" /&gt;

===Subtractive color===
The first practical [[subtractive color]] process was introduced by Kodak as "Kodachrome", a name recycled twenty years later for a very different and far better-known product. Filter-photographed red and blue-green records were printed onto the front and back of one strip of black-and-white [[duplitized film]]. After development, the resulting silver images were bleached away and replaced with color dyes, red on one side and cyan on the other. The pairs of superimposed dye images reproduced a useful but limited range of color. Kodak's first narrative film with the process was a short subject entitled ''Concerning $1000'' (1916). Though their duplitized film provided the basis for several commercialized two-color printing processes, the image origination and color-toning methods constituting Kodak's own process were little-used.

The first truly successful subtractive color process was William van Doren Kelley's [[Prizma]],&lt;ref name="afipriz"&gt;Slide, Anthony. (1990) "Prizma Color" ''The American Film Industry: A Historical Dictionary'' Limelight p. 271. {{ISBN|0-87910-139-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; an early color process that was first introduced at the [[American Museum of Natural History]] in New York City on 8 February 1917.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Ra0eAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA150#v=onepage Museum Notes], ''The American Museum Journal'' (1917), vol. 17, p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cornwell-Clyne, Adrian. (1951) ''Colour Cinematography'' Chapman and Hall press.&lt;/ref&gt; Prizma began in 1916 as an additive system similar to Kinemacolor.

However, after 1917, Kelley reinvented the process as a subtractive one with several years of short films and travelogues, such as ''Everywhere With Prizma'' (1919) and ''A Prizma Color Visit to Catalina'' (1919) before releasing features such as the documentary ''Bali the Unknown'' (1921), ''[[The Glorious Adventure (1922 film)|The Glorious Adventure]]'' (1922), and ''[[Venus of the South Seas]]'' (1924). A Prizma promotional short filmed for [[Del Monte Foods]] titled ''Sunshine Gatherers'' (1921) is available on DVD in Treasures 5 The West 1898–1938 by the National Film Preservation Foundation.

The invention of Prizma led to a series of similarly printed color processes.  This [[bipack color]] system used two strips of film running through the camera, one recording red, and one recording blue-green light. With the black-and-white negatives being printed onto duplitized film, the color images were then toned red and blue, effectively creating a subtractive color print.

[[Leon Forrest Douglass]] (1869–1940), a founder of [[Victor Records]], developed a system he called Naturalcolor, and first showed a short test film made in the process on 15 May 1917 at his home in [[San Rafael, California]].  The only feature film known to have been made in this process, ''[[Cupid Angling]]'' (1918) — starring [[Ruth Roland]] and with cameo appearances by [[Mary Pickford]] and [[Douglas Fairbanks]] — was filmed in the Lake Lagunitas area of [[Marin County, California]].&lt;ref&gt;Gracyk, Tim. ''[http://www.gracyk.com/leon.shtml Leon F. Douglass: Inventor and Victor's First Vice-President]'' (Retrieved on 2007-03-26)&lt;/ref&gt;

After experimenting with additive systems (including a [[movie camera|camera]] with two [[apertures]], one with a red filter, one with a green filter) from 1915 to 1921, Dr. [[Herbert Kalmus]], Dr. Daniel Comstock, and mechanic W. Burton Wescott developed a [[subtractive color]] system for [[Technicolor]]. The system used a [[beam splitter]] in a specially modified camera to send red and green light to adjacent frames of one strip of black-and-white film. From this negative, skip-printing was used to print each color's frames contiguously onto film stock with half the normal base thickness. The two prints were chemically toned to roughly complementary hues of red and green,&lt;ref name="encyclopedia" /&gt; then cemented together, back to back, into a single strip of film. The first film to use this process was ''[[The Toll of the Sea]]'' ([[1922 in film|1922]]) starring [[Anna May Wong]]. Perhaps the most ambitious film to use it was ''[[The Black Pirate]]'' ([[1926 in film|1926]]), starring and produced by [[Douglas Fairbanks]].

The process was later refined through the incorporation of dye [[imbibition]], which allowed for the transferring of dyes from both color matrices into a single print, avoiding several problems that had become evident with the cemented prints and allowing multiple prints to be created from a single pair of matrices.&lt;ref name="dictionary" /&gt;

Technicolor's system was very popular for a number of years, but it was a very expensive process: shooting cost three times that of black-and-white photography and printing costs were no cheaper. By 1932, color photography in general had nearly been abandoned by major studios, until Technicolor developed a new advancement to record all three primary colors. Utilizing a special [[dichroic]] [[beam splitter]] equipped with two 45-degree [[prism (optics)|prism]]s in the form of a cube, light from the lens was deflected by the prisms and split into two paths to expose each one of three black-and-white negatives (one each to record the densities for red, green, and blue).&lt;ref name="afitech"&gt;Slide, Anthony. (1990) "Technicolor" ''The American Film Industry: A Historical Dictionary'' Limelight pp. 338-340. {{ISBN|0-87910-139-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The three negatives were then printed to gelatin matrices, which also completely bleached the image, washing out the silver and leaving only the gelatin record of the image. A receiver print, consisting of a 50% density print of the black-and-white negative for the green record strip, and including the soundtrack, was struck and treated with dye mordants to aid in the imbibition process (this "black" layer was discontinued in the early 1940s). The matrices for each strip were coated with their complementary dye (yellow, cyan, or magenta), and then each successively brought into high-pressure contact with the receiver, which imbibed and held the dyes, which collectively rendered a wider spectrum of color than previous technologies.&lt;ref name="awsm"&gt;Hart, Martin (2003). "[http://www.widescreenmuseum.com/oldcolor/technicolor6.htm The History of Technicolor]" Widescreenmuseum.com. Retrieved 2006-07-07.&lt;/ref&gt; The first animation film with the three-color (also called three-strip) system was [[Walt Disney]]'s ''[[Flowers and Trees]]'' ([[1932 in film|1932]]), the first short live-action film was ''La Cucaracha'' ([[1934 in film|1934]]), and the first feature was ''[[Becky Sharp (film)|Becky Sharp]]'' ([[1935 in film|1935]]).&lt;ref name="encyclopedia" /&gt;

[[Gasparcolor]], a single-strip 3-color system, was developed in 1933 by the Hungarian chemist Dr. Bela Gaspar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oskarfischinger.org/GasparColor.htm|title=Gasparcolor: Perfect Hues for Animation|publisher=Fischinger Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The real push for color films and the nearly immediate changeover from black-and-white production to nearly all color film were pushed forward by the prevalence of television in the early 1950s. In 1947, only 12 percent of American films were made in color. By 1954, that number rose to over 50 percent.&lt;ref name="history" /&gt; The rise in color films was also aided by the breakup of Technicolor's near monopoly on the medium.

In 1947, the United States Justice Department filed an antitrust suit against Technicolor for monopolization of color cinematography (even though rival processes such as [[Cinecolor]] and [[Trucolor]] were in general use). In 1950, a federal court ordered Technicolor to allot a number of its three-strip cameras for use by independent studios and filmmakers. Although this certainly affected Technicolor, its real undoing was the invention of [[Eastmancolor]] that same year.&lt;ref name="history" /&gt;

==Monopack color film==
[[Image:35mm-undevel.jpg|left|thumb|150px|A strip of undeveloped 35 mm color negative.]]

In the field of motion pictures, the many-layered type of color film normally called an ''integral tripack'' in broader contexts has long been known by the less tongue-twisting term ''monopack''. For many years, Monopack (capitalized) was a proprietary product of Technicolor Corp, whereas monopack (not capitalized) generically referred to any of several single-strip color film products, certainly including various Eastman Kodak products. It appears that Technicolor made no attempt to register Monopack as a trademark with the [[US Patent and Trademark Office]], although it certainly asserted that term as if it were a registered trademark, and it had the force of a legal agreement between it and Eastman Kodak to back up that assertion. It was a solely-sourced product, too, as Eastman Kodak was legally prevented from marketing any color motion picture film products wider than 16mm, 35mm specifically, until the expiration of the so-called "Monopack Agreement" in 1950. This, notwithstanding the facts that Technicolor never had the capability to manufacture sensitized motion picture films of any kind, nor single-strip color films based upon its so-called "Troland Patent" (which patent Technicolor maintained covered all monopack-type films in general, but monopack-type motion picture films in particular, and which Eastman Kodak elected not to contest as Technicolor was then one of its largest customers, if not its largest customer). After 1950, Eastman Kodak was free to make and market color films of any kind, particularly including monopack color motion picture films in 65/70mm, 35mm, 16mm and 8mm. The "Monopack Agreement" had no effect on color still films.

Monopack color films are based on the subtractive color system, which filters colors from white light by using superimposed cyan, magenta and yellow dye images. Those images are created from records of the amounts of red, green and blue light present at each point of the image formed by the camera lens. A subtractive primary color (cyan, magenta, yellow) is what remains when one of the additive primary colors (red, green, blue) has been removed from the spectrum. Eastman Kodak's monopack color films incorporated three separate layers of differently color sensitive emulsion into one strip of film. Each layer recorded one of the additive primaries and was processed to produce a dye image in the [[complementary color|complementary]] subtractive primary.

[[Kodachrome]] was the first commercially successful application of monopack multilayer film, introduced in 1935.&lt;ref name="explore"&gt;''Exploring the Color Image'' (1996) Eastman Kodak Publication H-188.&lt;/ref&gt; For professional motion picture photography, Kodachrome Commercial, on a 35mm [[Film perforations#BH|BH-perforated]] base, was available exclusively from Technicolor, as its so-called "Technicolor Monopack" product. Similarly, for sub-professional motion picture photography, Kodachrome Commercial, on a 16mm base, was available exclusively from Eastman Kodak. In both cases, Eastman Kodak was the sole manufacturer and the sole processor. In the 35mm case, Technicolor [[Dye-transfer process|dye-transfer]] printing was a "tie-in" product.&lt;ref&gt;The tie-in ensures the quality of the tied-good when the tied good (dye-transfer printing, in this case) is used in conjunction with the tying good (Three-Strip or Monopack origination, in this case), paraphrasing ''Tie-in Sales and Price Discrimination'', S. J. Liebowitz, University of Texas at Dallas.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 16mm case, there were Eastman Kodak duplicating and printing stocks and associated chemistry, not the same as a "tie-in" product. In exceptional cases, Technicolor offered 16mm dye-transfer printing, but this necessitated the exceptionally wasteful process of printing on a 35mm base, only thereafter to be re-perforated and re-slit to 16mm, thereby discarding slightly more than one-half of the end product.

A late modification to the "Monopack Agreement", the "Imbibition Agreement", finally allowed Technicolor to economically manufacture 16mm dye-transfer prints as so-called "double-rank" 35/32mm prints (two 16mm prints on a 35mm base that was originally perforated at the 16mm specification for both halves, and was later re-slit into two 16mm wide prints without the need for re-perforation). This modification also facilitated the early experiments by Eastman Kodak with its negative-positive monopack film, which eventually became Eastmancolor. Essentially, the "Imbibition Agreement" lifted a portion of the "Monopack Agreement's" restrictions on Technicolor (which prevented it from making motion picture products less than 35mm wide) and somewhat related restrictions on Eastman Kodak (which prevented it from experimenting and developing monopack products greater than 16mm wide).

[[Eastmancolor]], introduced in 1950,&lt;ref name="motion.kodak.com"&gt;[http://motion.kodak.com/US/en/motion/Products/Chronology_Of_Film/chrono2.htm Chronology of Motion Picture Films: 1940–1959] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090625062139/http://motion.kodak.com/US/en/motion/Products/Chronology_Of_Film/chrono2.htm |date=2009-06-25 }}, Kodak.&lt;/ref&gt; was Kodak's first economical, single-strip [[35 mm film|35 mm]] negative-positive process incorporated into one strip of film.  This rendered Three-Strip color photography relatively obsolete, even though, for the first few years of Eastmancolor, Technicolor continued to offer Three-Strip origination combined with dye-transfer printing (150 titles produced in 1953, 100 titles produced in 1954 and 50 titles produced in 1955, the very last year for Three-Strip).  The first commercial feature film to use Eastmancolor was the documentary ''[[Royal Journey]]'', released in December 1951.&lt;ref name="motion.kodak.com"/&gt;  Hollywood studios waited until an improved version of Eastmancolor negative came out in 1952 before using it; ''[[This is Cinerama]]'' was an early film which employed three separate and interlocked strips of Eastmancolor negative. ''This is Cinerama'' was initially printed on Eastmancolor positive, but its significant success eventually resulted in it being reprinted by Technicolor, using dye-transfer.

By 1953, and especially with the introduction of anamorphic wide screen [[Cinemascope|CinemaScope]], Eastmancolor became a marketing imperative as CinemaScope was incompatible with Technicolor's Three-Strip camera and lenses. Indeed, Technicolor Corp became one of the best, if not the best, processor of Eastmancolor negative, especially for so-called "wide gauge" negatives (5-perf 65mm, 6-perf 35mm), yet it far preferred its own 35mm dye-transfer printing process for Eastmancolor-originated films with a print run that exceeded 500 prints,&lt;ref&gt;At one point, Technicolor implemented a two-tiered print pricing structure, one for dye-transfer prints, which favored large volume printing, and one Eastmancolor prints, which favored small volume printing—but this was after the "tie-in" between origination and printing had been broken by the abandonment of Three-Strip and Monopack origination. For small print runs, dye-transfer remained an option, but at a significantly higher cost.&lt;/ref&gt; not withstanding the significant "loss of register" that occurred in such prints that were expanded by CinemaScope's 2X horizontal factor, and, to a lesser extent, with so-called "flat wide screen" (variously 1.66:1 or 1.85:1, but spherical and not anamorphic). This nearly fatal flaw was not corrected until 1955 and caused numerous features initially printed by Technicolor to be scrapped and reprinted by [[Deluxe Entertainment Services Group|DeLuxe Labs]]. (These features are often billed as "Color by Technicolor-DeLuxe".) Indeed, some Eastmancolor-originated films billed as "Color by Technicolor" were never actually printed using the dye-transfer process, due in part to the throughput limitations of Technicolor's dye-transfer printing process, and competitor DeLuxe's superior throughput. Incredibly, DeLuxe once had a license to install a Technicolor-type dye-transfer printing line, but as the "loss of register" problems became apparent in Fox's CinemaScope features that were printed by Technicolor, after Fox had become an all-CinemaScope producer, Fox-owned DeLuxe Labs abandoned its plans for dye-transfer printing and became, and remained, an all-Eastmancolor shop, as Technicolor itself later became.

Technicolor continued to offer its proprietary imbibition dye-transfer printing process for projection prints until 1975, and even briefly revived it in 1998.  As an archival format, Technicolor prints are one of the most stable color print processes yet created, and prints properly cared for are estimated to retain their color for centuries.&lt;ref name="wilhelm"&gt;Wilhelm, Henry with Brower, Carol (1993) ''The Permanence and Care of Color Photographs''.

Improperly stored monopack color film from before 1983 can incur a 30 percent image loss in as little as 25 years.&lt;ref&gt;Holben, Jay (June 1999).

==How a color film works==
[[Image:Color film.jpg|right|thumb|200px|A representation of the layers within a piece of developed color 35 mm negative film. When developed, the dye couplers in the blue-, green-, and red-sensitive layers turn the exposed silver halide crystals to their complementary colors (yellow, magenta, and cyan). The film is made up of (A) Clear protective topcoat, (B) UV filter, (C) "Fast" blue layer, (D) "Slow" blue layer, (E) Yellow filter to cut all blue light from passing through to (F) "Fast" green layer, (G) "Slow" green layer, (H) Inter (subbing) layer, (I) "Fast" red layer, (J) "Slow" red layer, (K) Clear triacetate base, and (L) Antihalation (rem-jet) backing.]]

A color film is made up of many different layers that work together to create the color image.  Color negative films provide three main color layers: the blue record, green record, and red record; each made up of two separate layers containing silver halide crystals and dye-couplers.  A cross-sectional representation of a piece of developed color negative film is shown in the figure at the right.  Each layer of the film is so thin that the composite of all layers, in addition to the triacetate base and antihalation backing, is less than 0.0003" (8&amp;nbsp;µm) thick.&lt;ref name="hone"&gt;''Kodak Motion Picture Film (H1)'' (4th ed). Eastman Kodak Company. {{ISBN|0-87985-477-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The three color records are stacked as shown at right, with a UV filter on top to keep the non-visible ultraviolet radiation from exposing the silver-halide crystals, which are naturally sensitive to UV light.  Next are the fast and slow blue-sensitive layers, which, when developed, form the latent image.  When the exposed silver-halide crystal is developed, it is coupled with a dye grain of its complementary color.  This forms a dye "cloud" (like a drop of water on a paper towel) and is limited in its growth by development-inhibitor-releasing (DIR) couplers, which also serve to refine the sharpness of the processed image by limiting the size of the dye clouds. The dye clouds formed in the blue layer are actually yellow (the opposite or complementary color to blue).&lt;ref name="stockone"&gt;Holben, Jay. (April 2000). "Taking Stock" Part 1 of 2. ''American Cinematographer Magazine'' ASC Press. pp. 118-130&lt;/ref&gt;  There are two layers to each color; a "fast" and a "slow."  The fast layer features larger grains that are more sensitive to light than the slow layer, which has finer grain and is less sensitive to light.  Silver-halide crystals are naturally sensitive to blue light, so the blue layers are on the top of the film and they are followed immediately by a yellow filter, which stops any more blue light from passing through to the green and red layers and biasing those crystals with extra blue exposure.  Next are the red-sensitive record (which forms cyan dyes when developed); and, at the bottom, the green-sensitive record, which forms magenta dyes when developed.  Each color is separated by a gelatin layer that prevents silver development in one record from causing unwanted dye formation in another. On the back of the [[film base]] is an anti-halation layer that absorbs light which would otherwise be weakly reflected back through the film by that surface and create halos of light around bright features in the image. In color film, this backing is "rem-jet", a black-pigmented, non-gelatin layer which is removed in the developing process.&lt;ref name="hone" /&gt;

Eastman Kodak manufactures film in 54-inch (1,372&amp;nbsp;mm) wide rolls.  These rolls are then slit into various sizes (70&amp;nbsp;mm, 65&amp;nbsp;mm, 35&amp;nbsp;mm, 16&amp;nbsp;mm) as needed.

==Manufacturers of color film for motion picture use==
{{see also|List of motion picture film stocks}}

Motion picture film, primarily because of the rem-jet backing, requires different processing than standard [[C-41 process]] color film. The process necessary is ECN-2, which has an initial step using an alkaline bath to remove the backing layer. There are also minor differences in the remainder of the process. If motion picture negative is run through a standard C-41 color film developer bath, the rem-jet backing partially dissolves and destroys the integrity of the developer and, potentially, ruins the film.

===Kodak color motion picture films===
In the late 1980s, Kodak introduced the [[Tabular-grain film|T-Grain]] emulsion, a technological advancement in the shape and make-up of silver halide grains in their films. T-Grain is a tabular silver halide grain that allows for greater overall surface area, resulting in greater light sensitivity with a relatively small grain and a more uniform shape that results in a less overall graininess to the film. This made for sharper and more sensitive films. The T-Grain technology was first employed in Kodak's EXR line of motion picture color negative stocks.&lt;ref name="stocktwo"&gt;Probst, Christopher. (May 2000). "Taking Stock" Part 2 of 2 ''American Cinematographer Magazine'' ASC Press. pp. 110-120&lt;/ref&gt; This was further refined in 1996 with the Vision line of emulsions, followed by Vision2 in the early 2000s and Vision3 in 2007.

===Fuji color motion picture films===
Fuji films also integrate tabular grains in their SUFG (Super Unified Fine Grain) films. In their case, the SUFG grain is not only tabular, it is hexagonal and consistent in shape throughout the emulsion layers. Like the T-grain, it has a larger surface area in a smaller grain (about one-third the size of traditional grain) for the same light sensitivity. In 2005, Fuji unveiled their Eterna 500T stock, the first in a new line of advanced emulsions, with Super Nano-structure Σ Grain Technology.

The '''Colorado Antiquarian Book Seminar''', founded in the late 1970s, provides training for dealers in out-of-print, used, and antiquarian books.

==Origins==
The Seminar was the brainchild of Margaret Knox Goggin, on the faculty (and formerly dean) of the School of Librarianship at the [[University of Denver]]. The first session, held at the University in December 1977, was primarily intended for librarians who wished to improve their skills in buying used, out-of-print, and rare books.&lt;ref&gt;''AB Bookman's Weekly,'' June 23, 1980, p. 4886.&lt;/ref&gt; Twenty-five registrants heard lectures by Goggin, Jacob L. Chernofsky (Editor and Publisher of [[AB Bookman's Weekly]]), Lee Ash, and Harry U. Mooney (Collection Development Coordinator, [[Denver Public Library]]). The success of the venture encouraged Goggin and Chernofsky to offer an annual seminar beginning in 1979 on the out-of-print and antiquarian book market, "designed to help librarians throughout the country with a working knowledge of the out-of-print and antiquarian book trade and the role of that market in acquisitions procedures and collection development." &lt;ref&gt;''AB Bookman's Weekly,'' June 18, 1980, p. 4664.&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly 50 students attended the 1979 Seminar, which was oriented toward the needs of librarians; nevertheless, "a half dozen booksellers also registered — pointing up the need for such a course for booksellers as well as librarians.” &lt;ref&gt;''AB Bookman's Weekly,'' June 23, 1980 p. 4886.&lt;/ref&gt; Faculty members at the 1979 Seminar included the autograph dealer Mary A. Benjamin, Franklin Gilliam (Brick Row Book Shop, San Francisco), Edwin V. Glaser (a dealer specializing in rare medical books, based in Sausalito, CA), Katharine Kyes Leab (Editor of ''American Book Prices Current''), Murray S. Martin (Penn State), Bernard M. Rosenthal (a San Francisco-based dealer specializing in early printed books), and Florian Shasky (Stanford University Libraries).

==Early years==
The Seminar became an annual event held in August at the University of Denver under the co-directorship of Goggin and Chernofsky, its title settling down as "A Workshop-Seminar on the Out-of-Print and Antiquarian Book Market for Booksellers and Librarians," designed "to meet the needs of acquisitions librarians, those responsible for developing collections, rare book librarians, as well as booksellers and prospective booksellers.".&lt;ref&gt;''AB Bookman's Weekly,'' 23 June 1980, pp. 4886-89; July 7, 1980, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; The Seminar lecturers varied somewhat from year to year, but a core faculty emerged that included, besides Jake Chernofsky and Margaret Goggin, Michael Ginsberg (an Americana dealer based in Sharon, MA), Ed Glaser, Robert W. Topp (Hermitage Book Shop, Denver), and [[Jake Zeitlin]] (Zeitlin &amp; Ver Brugge, Los Angeles). Other stalwart faculty members were to include Mary Francis Ciletti, Lois Harvey, Jennifer Larson, Jean Parmer, and Richard Weatherford. Though there were always a few librarians in attendance, by the mid-1980s, the typical Seminar student was a used, out-of-print, or rare bookseller (or someone who wished to become one).

==Success==
The Seminar was soon attracting over 100 registrants annually. It ran extra sessions at the University of Florida in March 1988 and March 1994, in addition to the annual sessions in Colorado each August. Its success was chronicled in a series of annual articles by ''AB Bookman's Weekly'''s Associate Editor, Rebecca Myers, often titled with some variant of "Book is a four-letter word."&lt;ref&gt;"Antiquarian Book Seminar Entering Its 2nd Decade," May 29, 1989, pp. 2397-2402; "Antiquarian Book Seminar Launches Second Decade," May 28, 1990; "Where the Favorite Four-Letter Word is Book," June 24, 1991, pp. 2619-24 and May 11, 1992, 1929-32; "Sharing the Fingerspitzengefuehl," May 17, 1993, pp. 2091-94; "Where the Favorite Four-Letter Word is Book," May 16, 1994, pp. 2155-58 and Jan 9, 1995, pp. 9=-98.&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in 1985, a keynote speaker began the proceedings on Sunday night. Notable keynoters included John Y. Cole (1985; [[Center for the Book]], [[Library of Congress]]); Marcus A. McCorison (1987; Director and Librarian, [[American Antiquarian Society]]); Robert Rosenthal (1989; head of special collections, [[University of Chicago]]); and Louis Weinstein (1999; Heritage Book Shop, Los Angeles). By the late 1980s, the Seminar had established a tradition of asking a different specialist dealer to join the faculty each year: Diane deBlois in 1988 (aGatherin', Wynanskill, NY; printed ephemera); Patterson Smith in 1990 (Montclair, NJ; true crime); John Crichton in 1991 (Brick Row Book Shop, San Francisco: literature); Priscilla Juvelis in 1996 (Boston; artists' books); and so on.

==Transition Years==
Margaret Knox Goggin stepped down as co-director of the Seminar after the 1994 Gainesville and Colorado Seminars, and the Denver connection weakened. The 1993 Seminar was hosted by the Colorado School of Mines in Golden; in 1995 the Seminar moved to [[Colorado College]], in [[Colorado Springs, Colorado]] (where it has been, ever since). Chernofsky continued as director, with Jennifer Larson as unnamed co-director; but in the later 1990s his magazine, [[AB Bookman's Weekly]], was faltering, unable to cope with the rise of internet bookselling; ''AB'' ceased publication in 1999, and Chernofsky sold the Seminar to faculty members Michael Ginsberg, Edwin Glaser, Lois Harvey, and Jennifer Larson (later, Daniel De Simone and Robert Rulon-Miller, Jr. jointly purchased a 1/5 share of the Seminar from the other shareholders). The Seminar was slow to refocus its presentations on what students most wanted to learn: more about researching and pricing used general-interest books; more about selling on eBay and the internet; less about older and more valuable antiquarian books. Attendance declined; by 2004, the average number of participants had fallen to well under 50.

==CABS Becomes a 501(c)(3) Tax-Exempt Corporation==
The Seminar reinvigorated itself in the mid-2000s, with faculty additions [[Terry Belanger]], Thomas E. Congalton (Between the Covers Rare Books, Gloucester City, NJ), Daniel De Simone (Rosenwald Curator, Library of Congress), internet specialist Dan Gregory (Between the Covers), [[Kevin Royal Johnson]] (Royal Books, Baltimore), and Robert Rulon-Miller, Jr. (Rulon-Miller Books, St Paul, MN) joining Seminar stalwarts Ginsberg and Glaser. Participant response was enthusiastic,&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, comments by Kenny Parolini, https://web.archive.org/web/20080704124325/http://ioba.org/newsletter/archive/7%282%29/toolbox2.php, accessed 2011-11-01; by Maria Hutchison, http://www.abebooks.com/blog/index.php/2007/08/08/update-from-the-colorado-antiquarian-book-seminar, accessed 2011-11-01; and by Joel Perlman (in the newsletter of the Independent Online Booksellers Association, http://ioba.org/standard/2011/06/2009-colorado-antiquarian-book-seminar-cabs-journal-or-teaching-an-old-dog-some-new-tricks/, accessed 2011-09-18.&lt;/ref&gt; and attendance began to climb. The Seminar's title was given its present form: Colorado Antiquarian Book Seminar (CABS) and a new [http://www.bookseminars.com website], and the proprietors relinquished their shares to a tax-exempt, not-for-profit corporation called the Antiquarian Book School Foundation. The current director of CABS is Rob Rulon-Miller and the current local coordinator at [[Colorado College]] is Kathy Lindeman; the chairman of the Foundation's board is Rob Rulon-Miller. The ongoing faculty comprises bookseller Lorne W. Bair (Winchester, VA); Terry Belanger (Charlottesville, VA); Brian Cassidy (Silver Spring, MD), Maria Lin (Saint Paul, MN); Katherine Reagan (Curator ofRare Books and Manuscripts, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY), Rob Rulon-Miller (Saint Paul, MN) and Garrett Scott (Ann Arbor, MI).

Since 1980, nearly 3,000 persons have attended the Seminar, which throughout its existence has had the strong support of the [[Antiquarian Booksellers' Association of America]] (ABAA): CABS board and faculty members over the years have included ABAA Presidents Thomas E. Congalton, Edwin V. Glaser, Michael Ginsberg, Bernard M. Rosenthal, Robert Rulon-Miller Jr, John Thomson, and others. In recent years, scholarships to CABS have been provided not only by ABAA (Woodburn Scholarships) but also by [[AbeBooks]], [[Biblio.com]], Bibliopolis, IOBA [[Independent Online Booksellers Association]], and the Rocky Mountain Antiquarian Booksellers Association (RMABA) as well as by the faculty themselves. Most of the current attendees are booksellers (or prospective booksellers), but librarians and book collectors sometimes attend, as well.

Now in its 40th year, the Colorado Antiquarian Book Seminar is the oldest, continuously operated educational institution in the world for the antiquarian book trade, predating Rare Book School in Virginia, which was partially modeled on the Colorado Seminar, by nearly five years. Of the nearly 3,000 or so graduates of the Seminar, a remarkably high percentage of them are still involved in books, either as booksellers, librarians, and/or collectors.

The '''conspiracy thriller''' (or '''paranoid thriller''') is a subgenre of [[Thriller (genre)|thriller fiction]]. The protagonists of conspiracy thrillers are often journalists or amateur investigators who find themselves (often inadvertently) pulling on a small thread which unravels a vast conspiracy that ultimately goes "all the way to the top."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://movies2.nytimes.com/gst/movies/movie.html?v_id=1613 | work=The New York Times | first=Manohla | last=Dargis | accessdate=2010-04-30 | title=We're Sorry | date=2005-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The complexities of historical fact are recast as a [[morality play]] in which bad people cause bad events, and good people identify and defeat them. Conspiracies are often played out as "man-in-peril" (or "woman-in-peril")&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.courierpostonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070525/ENT/705250305/1042] {{deadlink|date=February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; stories, or yield [[quest]] narratives similar to those found in [[whodunnit]]s and [[detective fiction|detective stories]]. 

A common theme in such works is that characters uncovering the conspiracy encounter difficulty ascertaining the truth amid the deceptions: rumors, lies, [[propaganda]], and counter-propaganda build upon one another until what is conspiracy and what is coincidence become entangled. Many conspiracy fiction works also include the theme of [[secret history]].

==Literature==
[[John Buchan]]'s 1915 novel ''[[The Thirty-Nine Steps]]'' weaves elements of conspiracy and man-on-the-run archetypes. [[Dashiell Hammett]]'s 1924 short story "[[Nightmare Town (short story)|Nightmare Town]]" is conspiracy fiction on a small scale, depicting an Arizona town that exists as part of an insurance-fraud scheme, and a detective slowly uncovering the truth. [[Graham Greene]]'s 1943 novel ''[[Ministry of Fear]]'' (brought to the big screen by [[Fritz Lang]] in 1944) combines all the ingredients of paranoia and conspiracy familiar to aficionados of the 1970s thrillers, with additional urgency and depth added by its wartime backdrop. Greene himself credited [[Michael Innes]] as the inspiration for his "entertainment".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catswhiskers.fsnet.co.uk/reviews.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-03-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060212004028/http://www.catswhiskers.fsnet.co.uk/reviews.html |archivedate=2006-02-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Conspiracy fiction in the US reached its zenith in the 1960s and 1970s in the wake of a number of high-profile scandals and controversies, most notably the [[Vietnam War]], the assassinations of [[John F. Kennedy]], [[Robert Kennedy]], and [[Martin Luther King Jr.]], as well as the [[Watergate scandal]] and the subsequent resignation of [[Richard Nixon]] from the presidency. Several fictional works explored the clandestine machinations and conspiracies beneath the orderly fabric of political life. American novelist [[Richard Condon]] wrote a number of conspiracy thrillers, including the seminal ''[[The Manchurian Candidate]]'' (1959), and ''[[Winter Kills]]'', which was made into a film by [[William Richert]] in 1979. ''[[The Illuminatus Trilogy|Illuminatus!]]'' (1969–1971), a trilogy by [[Robert Shea]] and [[Robert Anton Wilson]], is regarded by many as the definitive work of 20th-century conspiracy fiction. Set in the late '60s, it is a psychedelic tale which fuses mystery, science fiction, horror, and comedy in its exhibition (and mourning, and mocking) of one of the more paranoid periods of recent history. [[Thomas Pynchon]]'s ''[[The Crying of Lot 49]]'' (1966) includes a secretive conflict between cartels dating back to the Middle Ages. ''[[Gravity's Rainbow]]'' also draws heavily on conspiracy theory in describing the motives and operations of the [[Phoebus cartel]] as well as the development of [[ballistic missiles]] during [[World War II]]. ''[[Inherent Vice]]'' also involves an intentionally ambiguous conspiracy involving a group known as the Golden Fang. 

John Macgregor's 1986 novel ''[[Propinquity (novel)|Propinquity]]'' describes an attempt by a modern couple to revive the frozen body of a gnostic medieval Queen, buried deep under Westminster Abbey. Their attempt to expose the feminine aspect of Christianity's origins results in fierce Church opposition and, eventually, an international manhunt. [[Umberto Eco]]'s ''[[Foucault's Pendulum (book)|Foucault's Pendulum]]'' (1988) features a story in which the staff of a publishing firm, intending to create a series of popular occult books, invent their own occult conspiracy, over which they lose control as it begins to supplant the truth. The popular 2003 [[novel]] ''[[The Da Vinci Code]]'' by [[Dan Brown]] draws on conspiracy theories involving the [[Roman Catholic Church]], [[Opus Dei]] and the [[Priory of Sion]]. Other contemporary authors who have used elements of conspiracy theory in their work include [[Margaret Atwood]], [[William S. Burroughs]], [[Don DeLillo]], [[James Ellroy]], [[Joseph Heller]], [[Robert Ludlum]], [[David Morrell]] and [[James Clancy Phelan]].

One of the first science fiction novels to deal with a full-blown conspiracy theory was [[Eric Frank Russell]]'s ''[[Dreadful Sanctuary]]'' (1948).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ansible.co.uk/writing/damned.html |title=SF Books of the Damned |website=Ansible.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2016-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; This deals with a number of sabotaged space missions and the apparent discovery that Earth is being quarantined by aliens from other planets of the [[Solar System]]. However, as the novel progresses it emerges that this view is a [[Paranoia|paranoid]] delusion perpetuated by a small but powerful [[secret society]]. [[Philip K. Dick]] wrote a large number of short stories where vast conspiracies were employed (usually by an oppressive government or other hostile powers) to keep common people under control or enforce a given agenda. Other popular science fiction writers whose work features conspiracy theories include [[William Ford Gibson|William Gibson]], [[John Twelve Hawks]], and [[Neal Stephenson]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2803">The '''Contemporary Artists' Books Conference''' ('''CABC''') was started in 2008 by the New York Chapter of the Art Libraries Society of North America (ARLIS/NY) in collaboration with the [[NY Art Book Fair]]. It has been held annually during the Fair as part of its special programming.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nyartbookfair.com/about/ NY Art Book Fair.] website.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

In 2006, [[Printed Matter, Inc]], under the direction of its former Director and President [[AA Bronson]], launched the NY Art Book Fair (NYABF).&lt;ref&gt;[http://printedmatter.org/ Printed Matter.] website.&lt;/ref&gt; The Contemporary Artists' Books Conference (CABC) was started two years later by the New York Chapter of the Art Libraries Society of North America in collaboration with the NYABF. In subsequent years, the conference was held directly within the Fair as part of the Fair's public programming.&lt;ref&gt;Maria Lokke (2012). [http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/photobooth/2012/09/how-to-prep-for-the-ny-art-book-fair.html#slide_ss_0=1 "How to Prep for the NY Art Book Fair."] ''The New Yorker'' (September 27).&lt;/ref&gt;

The CABC was initially organized by a volunteer committee of art librarians from the New York area, including James Mitchell, formerly of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]; Jennifer Tobias, Milan Hughston and David Senior of the [[Museum of Modern Art|Museum of Modern Art Library]]; Deirdre Donohue and Matthew Carson of the [[International Center of Photography]]; Ryan Haley of the [[New York Public Library]]; Deirdre Lawrence of the [[Brooklyn Museum|Brooklyn Museum Library]]; and Tony White of the [[Maryland Institute College of Art]]. [[Stephen J. Bury]] of the [[Frick Art Reference Library]] joined the committee in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nyartbookfair.com/conference/ Contemporary Artists' Books Conference at NY Art Book Fair.] website.&lt;/ref&gt;

The CABC was also included in Printed Matter's LA Art Book Fair beginning in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;LA Art Book Fair website http://laartbookfair.net/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Programming==

Although the programming for the conference varies from year to year, all conferences are united by their focus on emerging practices and issues within art-book culture. In addition to organizing the annual conference, CABC's planning committee commissions a new artists’ book as part of its program. Previously commissioned artists include James Hoff, Eve Fowler, Dexter Sinister, [[David Horvitz]], Triin Tamm and Emily Roysdon, and the “assembled magazine” ''Adventures,'' produced by Aaron Flint Jamison.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nyartbookfair.com/conference/ Contemporary Artists' Books Conference at NY Art Book Fair.] website.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Creative limitation''' is the concept of how purposely limiting oneself can actually drive creativity. At a 2013 [[TED (conference) |TED conference]], artist [[Phil Hansen (artist)|Phil Hansen]] made several remarks concerning the value of limitations, among them that "We need to first be limited in order to become limitless,” and “If you treat the problems as possibilities, life will start to dance with you in the most amazing ways.”&lt;ref name=TED.com group=TED.com&gt;{{cite web|last=May|first=Kate Torgovnick|url=http://blog.ted.com/2013/03/05/can-limitations-make-you-more-creative-a-qa-with-artist-phil-hansen/|title=Can limitations make you more creative? A Q&amp;A with artist Phil Hansen|work=Writer|publisher=TED Blog|accessdate=17 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Creative limitation can also be thought of as a way to achieve a novel effect or goal that is not otherwise possible using [[Convention (norm)|conventional]], readily accessible, methods. [[Igor Stravinsky]] used what he called creative limitation with [[time signature]]s, by restricting himself from using any, in his [[musical composition|composition]] '[[The Rite of Spring]]' as well as in alternate aspects of his other musical works.

'''Deployment''' is the realisation of an application, or execution of a [[plan]], idea, [[scientific modelling|model]], [[design]], [[specification]], [[Standardization|standard]], [[algorithm]], or [[policy]].

== Industry-Specific Definitions ==

=== Computer Science ===
In [[computer science]], a deployment is a realisation of a [[technical specification]] or algorithm as a [[computer program|program]], [[software component]], or other [[computer system]] through [[computer programming]] and [[Software deployment|deployment]].  Many implementations may exist for a given specification or standard.  For example, [[web browser]]s contain implementations of [[World Wide Web Consortium]]-recommended specifications, and software development tools contain deployment of [[programming languages]].

A special case occurs in [[object-oriented programming]], when a [[concrete class|concrete]] [[class (object-oriented programming)|class]] deploys an [[interface (object-oriented programming)|interface]]; in this case the concrete class is an ''deployment'' of the interface and it includes methods which are ''deployments'' of those [[method (object-oriented programming)|method]]s specified by the interface.

=== Information Technology (IT) ===
In the IT Industry, deployment refers to post-sales process of guiding a client from purchase to use of the software or hardware that was purchased. This includes requirements analysis, scope analysis, customisations, systems integrations, user policies, user training and delivery. These steps are often overseen by a project manager using [[project management]] methodologies. [[Software Deployment]] involves several professionals that are relatively new to the knowledge based economy such as [[Business analysis|business analysts]], [[Technical analysis|technical analysts]], [[solutions architect]]s, and project managers.

To deploy a system successfully, a large number of inter-related tasks need to be carried out in an appropriate sequence. Utilising a well-proven implementation methodology and enlisting professional advice can help but often it is the number of tasks, poor planning and inadequate resourcing that causes problems with an deployment project, rather than any of the tasks being particularly difficult. Similarly with the cultural issues it is often the lack of adequate consultation and two-way communication that inhibits achievement of the desired results.

=== Political Science ===
In [[political science]], deployment refers to the carrying out of [[public policy]]. [[Legislatures]] pass laws that are then carried out by [[public servants]] working in [[bureaucracy|bureaucratic agencies]]. This process consists of rule-making, rule-administration and rule-adjudication. Factors impacting deployment include the legislative intent, the administrative capacity of the deploying bureaucracy, interest group activity and opposition, and executive support.

=== Social and Health Sciences ===
"Deployment is defined as a specified set of activities designed to put into practice an activity or program of known dimensions. According to this definition, deployment processes are purposeful and are described in sufficient detail such that independent observers can detect the presence and strength of the "specific set of activities" related to implementation. In addition, the activity or program being deployed is described in sufficient detail so that independent observers can detect its presence and strength." &lt;ref name="NIRN2014"&gt;The National Implementation Research Network&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Water and Natural Resources ===
In water and natural resources, deployment refers to the actualisation of best management practices with the ultimate goals of conserving natural resources and improving the quality of water bodies.

== Role of End Users ==
System deployment generally benefits from high levels of user involvement and management support. User participation in the design and operation of information systems has several positive results. First, if users are heavily involved in systems design, they move opportunities to mold the system according to their priorities and business requirements, and more opportunities to control the outcome. Second, they are more likely to react positively to the change process. Incorporating user knowledge and expertise leads to better solutions.

The relationship between users and information systems specialists has traditionally been a problem area for information systems deployment efforts.  Users and information systems specialists tend to have different backgrounds, interests, and priorities. This is referred to as the user-designer communications gap. These differences lead to divergent organizational loyalties, approaches to problem solving, and vocabularies.&lt;ref name="Laudon2010"/&gt; Examples of these differences or concerns are below:

=== User Concerns ===
* Will the system deliver the information I need for my work?
* How quickly can I access the data?
* How easily can I retrieve the data?
* How much clerical support will I need to enter data into the system?
* How will the operation of the system fit into my daily business schedule?&lt;ref name="Laudon2010"&gt;Laudon, K., &amp; Laudon, J. (2010). "Management Information Systems: Managing the Digital Firm." Eleventh  Edition (11 ed.). New Jersey: Prentice Hall.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Designer Concerns ===
* How much storage space will the master file consume?
* How many lines of program code will it take to perform this function?
* How can we cut down on CPU time when we run the system?
* What are the most efficient ways of storing this data?
* What database management system should we use?&lt;ref name="Laudon2010"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2241">'''Descriptive poetics''' is an analytic approach within [[literary studies]]. While the concept of ''[[poetics]]'' goes back to [[Aristotle]], the term descriptive poetics refers to an approach which, according to [[Brian McHale]], represents a middle ground between theoretically oriented approaches and analyses of individual [[Creative works|works]] of [[literature]].

==Overview==
To McHale, the purpose of descriptive poetics is to give exhaustive accounts of different kinds of objects which can be a group of texts, the [[wikt:oeuvre|entire production]] of a single [[author]], a particular [[literary genre|genre]], the [[writing style|style]] of a period in [[literary history]] or even specific styles of [[literature]]. McHale argues that the approach is not defined by what it examines but by the level of ''generalization'' achieved in this form of literary studies.&lt;ref&gt;McHale, Brian (1994) "Whatever Happened to Descriptive Poetics?", ''The Point of Theory: Practices of Cultural Analysis'' (red. [[Mieke Bal]] &amp; Inga E. Bour). Amsterdam:  Amsterdam University Press, p. 59&lt;/ref&gt; The approach was given a formalized forum in the journal ''PTL: A Journal of Descriptive Poetics and Theory of Literature'' which only had a short run before it was succeeded by the more successful journal ''[[Poetics Today]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Mintz, Alan (1984) "On the Tel Aviv School of Poetics" i ''[[Prooftexts]]'', Vol. 4, No. 3&lt;/ref&gt; According to literary scholar Uni Margolin, descriptive poetics was a rather prominent form of scholarship in the first half of the 20th century, especially in Germany, but has since "been neglected since 1968 because of its low level of theoretisation".&lt;ref&gt;Margolin, Uni (2007) "[http://www.jltonline.de/index.php/articles/rt/printerFriendly/58/244 Response]" i ''[[Journal of Literary Theory]]'', Vol 1, No 1&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Epiphanius of Salamis''' ({{lang-grc-gre|Ἐπιφάνιος}}; c. 310–320 – 403) was bishop of [[Salamis, Cyprus]], at the end of the [[Christianity in the 4th century|4th century]]. He is considered a [[saint]] and a [[Church Father]] by both the [[Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] and [[Roman Catholic Church]]es. He gained a reputation as a strong defender of [[orthodoxy]]. He is best known for composing the ''[[Panarion]]'', a very large [[compendium]] of the [[Heresy|heresies]] up to his own time, full of quotations that are often the only surviving fragments of suppressed texts. According to [[Ernst Kitzinger]], he "seems to have been the first cleric to have taken up the matter of Christian religious images as a major issue", and there has been much controversy over how many of the quotations attributed to him by the [[Byzantine Iconoclasts]] were actually by him. Regardless of this he was clearly strongly [[Aniconism in Christianity|against some contemporary uses of images]] in the church.&lt;ref&gt;Kitzinger, 92–93, 92 quoted&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Epiphanius was born into a Christian Greek family in the small settlement of Besanduk, near [[Eleutheropolis]] (modern-day [[Beit Guvrin, Israel|Beit Guvrin]], Israel),&lt;ref&gt;The Panarion of Epiphanius of Salamis: Book I (Sects 1–46), By Epiphanius, Epiphanius of Salamis, Translated by Frank Williams, 1987 {{ISBN|90-04-07926-2}} p xi&lt;/ref&gt; and lived as a [[monk]] in Egypt, where he was educated and came into contact with [[Valentinius|Valentinian groups]]. He returned to [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] around 333, when he was still a young man, and he founded a monastery at Ad nearby,&lt;ref&gt;The more famous [[Monastery of Epiphanius]] near [[Thebes, Egypt]] was founded by an [[anchorite]] named Epiphanius towards the end of the sixth century; it was explored by an expedition from the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], 1912–14.&lt;/ref&gt; which is often mentioned in the [[polemics]] of [[Jerome]] with [[Tyrannius Rufinus|Rufinus]] and [[Bishop John II of Jerusalem|John, Bishop of Jerusalem]]. He was [[ordained]] a priest, and lived and studied as superior of the monastery in Ad that he founded for thirty years and gained much skill and knowledge in that position. In that position he gained the ability to speak in several tongues, including [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], [[Syriac language|Syriac]], [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]], [[Ancient Greek language|Greek]], and [[Latin]], and was called by Jerome on that account ''Pentaglossis'' ("Five tongued").&lt;ref&gt;''Ruf'' 3.6&lt;/ref&gt;

His reputation for learning prompted his nomination and [[consecration]] as Bishop of [[Salamis, Cyprus]],&lt;ref&gt;Salamis was also known as Constantia after [[Constantine II (emperor)|Constantine II]].&lt;/ref&gt; in 365 or 367, a post which he held until his death. He was also the [[Metropolitan bishop|Metropolitan]] of the [[Church of Cyprus]]. He served as bishop for nearly forty years, as well as travelled widely to combat unorthodox beliefs. He was present at a synod in [[Antioch]] (376) where the [[Trinitarianism|Trinitarian]] questions were debated against the heresy of [[Apollinarism|Apollinarianism]]. He upheld the position of Bishop [[Paulinus, Bishop of Antioch|Paulinus]], who had the support of Rome, over that of [[Meletius of Antioch]], who was supported by the Eastern Churches. In 382 he was present at the [[Council of Rome]], again upholding the cause of Paulinus.

==Origenist controversy and death==
{{main|Origenist Crises}}
During a visit to Palestine in 394 or 395, while preaching in Jerusalem, he attacked [[Origen]]'s followers and urged the Bishop of [[Jerusalem]], [[John II, Bishop of Jerusalem|John II]], to condemn his writings. He urged John to be careful of the "offence" of images in the churches. He noted that when travelling in Palestine he went into a church to pray and saw a curtain with an image of Christ or a saint which he tore down. He told Bishop John that such images were "opposed . . . to our religion" (see below).&lt;ref&gt;Part 9, Letter LI. From Epiphanius, Bishop of Salamis, in Cyprus, to John, Bishop of Jerusalem (c. 394), http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/3001051.htm.&lt;/ref&gt; This event sowed the seeds of conflict which erupted in the dispute between [[Tyrannius Rufinus|Rufinus]] and [[John II, Bishop of Jerusalem|John]] against [[Jerome]] and Epiphanius. Epiphanius fuelled this conflict by ordaining a priest for Jerome's monastery at Bethlehem, thus trespassing on John's jurisdiction. This dispute continued during the 390s, in particular in the literary works by Rufinus and Jerome attacking one another.

In 399, the dispute took on another dimension, when the Bishop of Alexandria, Theophilus, who had initially supported [[John II, Bishop of Jerusalem|John]], changed his views and started persecuting Origenist monks in Egypt. As a result of this persecution, four of these monks, the so-called Tall Brothers, fled to Palestine, and then travelled to Constantinople, seeking support and spreading the controversy. [[Saint John Chrysostom|John Chrysostom, Bishop of Constantinople]], gave the monks shelter. Bishop Theophilus of Alexandria saw his chance to use this event to bring down his enemy [[Saint John Chrysostom|Chrysostom]]: in 402 he summoned a council in Constantinople, and invited those supportive of his anti-Origenist views. Epiphanius, by this time nearly 80, was one of those summoned, and began the journey to Constantinople. However, when he realised he was being used as a tool by Theophilus against Chrysostom, who had given refuge to the monks persecuted by Theophilus and who were appealing to the emperor, Epiphanius started back to Salamis, only to die on the way home in 403.&lt;ref&gt;Frances Young with Andrew Teal, ''From Nicaea to Chalcedon: A Guide to the Literature and its Background’’, (2nd edn, 2004), pp202-3&lt;/ref&gt;

==The curtain incident==
Letter LI in Jerome's letters gives Jerome's Latin translation, made at Epiphanius' request, of his letter, originally in Greek from c. 394, "From Epiphanius, Bishop of Salamis, in Cyprus, to John, Bishop of Jerusalem" (see previous section for wider context).  The final section covers the often quoted incident of the curtain, which unlike other passages attributed to Epiphanius and quoted by the Iconoclasts, is accepted as authentic by modern scholars:&lt;ref&gt;Kitzinger, 92–93 and long note&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
9. Moreover, I have heard that certain persons have this grievance against me: When I accompanied you to the holy place called Bethel, there to join you in celebrating the Collect, after the use of the Church, I came to a villa called Anablatha and, as I was passing, saw a lamp burning there. Asking what place it was, and learning it to be a church, I went in to pray, and found there a curtain hanging on the doors of the said church, dyed and embroidered. It bore an image either of Christ or of one of the saints; I do not rightly remember whose the image was. Seeing this, and being loth that an image of a man should be hung up in Christ’s church contrary to the teaching of the Scriptures, I tore it asunder and advised the custodians of the place to use it as a winding sheet for some poor person. They, however, murmured, and said that if I made up my mind to tear it, it was only fair that I should give them another curtain in its place. As soon as I heard this, I promised that I would give one, and said that I would send it at once. Since then there has been some little delay, due to the fact that I have been seeking a curtain of the best quality to give to them instead of the former one, and thought it right to send to Cyprus for one. I have now sent the best that I could find, and I beg that you will order the presbyter of the place to take the curtain which I have sent from the hands of the Reader, and that you will afterwards give directions that curtains of the other sort—opposed as they are to our religion—shall not be hung up in any church of Christ. A man of your uprightness should be careful to remove an occasion of offence unworthy alike of the Church of Christ and of those Christians who are committed to your charge. Beware of Palladius of Galatia—a man once dear to me, but who now sorely needs God’s pity—for he preaches and teaches the heresy of Origen; and see to it that he does not seduce any of those who are intrusted to your keeping into the perverse ways of his erroneous doctrine. I pray that you may fare well in the Lord.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf206.v.LI.html NPNF2-06. Jerome: The Principal Works of St. Jerome, CCEL]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Writings==

===''[[Panarion]]''===
His best-known book is the ''[[Panarion]]'' which means "medicine-chest" (also known as ''Adversus Haereses'', "Against Heresies"), presented as a book of antidotes for those bitten by the serpent of heresy. Written between 374 and 377, it forms a handbook for dealing with the arguments of heretics.

It lists, and refutes, 80 [[Heresy#Early Christian heresies|heresies]], some of which are not described in any other surviving documents from the time. Epiphanius begins with the 'four mothers' of pre-Christian heresy – 'barbarism', 'Scythism', 'Hellenism' and 'Judaism' – and then addresses the sixteen pre-Christian heresies that have flowed from them: four philosophical schools (Stoics, Platonists, Pythagoreans and Epicureans), and twelve Jewish sects. There then follows an interlude, telling of the Incarnation of the Word. After this, Epiphanius embarks on his account of the sixty Christian heresies, from assorted gnostics to the various trinitarian heresies of the fourth century, closing with the [[Collyridians]] and [[Messalians]].&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Louth, 'Palestine', in Frances Young, Lewis Ayres and Andrew Young, eds, ''The Cambridge History of Early Christian Literature'', (2010), p286&lt;/ref&gt;

While Epiphanius often let his zeal come before facts – he admits on one occasion that he writes against the Origenists-based only on hearsay (''Panarion'', Epiphanius 71) – the ''Panarion'' is a valuable source of information on the Christian Church of the fourth century. It is also an important source regarding the early Jewish gospels such as the [[Gospel of the Hebrews|Gospel according to the Hebrews]] circulating among the [[Ebionites]] and the [[Nazarene (sect)|Nazarenes]], as well as the followers of [[Cerinthus]] and [[Merinthus]].&lt;ref&gt;Epiphanius , ''Panarion'', 30 iii 7&lt;/ref&gt;

One unique feature of the ''Panarion'' is in the way that Epiphanius compares the various heretics to different poisonous beasts, going so far as to describe in detail the animal's characteristics, how it produces its poison, and how to protect oneself from the animal's bite or poison. For example, he describes his enemy [[Origen]] as "a toad noisy from too much moisture which keeps croaking louder and louder." He compares the [[Gnostic]]s to a particularly dreaded snake "with no pangs." The [[Ebionites]], a Christian sect that followed Jewish law, were described by Epiphanius as "a monstrosity with many shapes, who practically formed the snake-like shape of the mythical many-headed Hydra in himself." In all, Epiphanius describes fifty animals, usually one per sect.&lt;ref name="Verheyden"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Verheyden|first=Joseph|year=2008|title=Epiphanius of Salamis on Beasts and Heretics|journal=Journal of Eastern Christian Studies|volume=60|issue=1–4|pages=143–173|url=http://secure.peeters-leuven.be/content.php?url=article.php&amp;id=2035279&amp;journal_code=JECS&amp;download=yes|doi=10.2143/jecs.60.1.2035279}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another feature of the ''Panarion'' is the access its earlier sections provide to lost works, notably Justin Martyr's work on heresies, the Greek of Irenaeus' ''Against Heresies'', and Hippolytus' ''Syntagma''.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Louth, 'Palestine', in Frances Young, Lewis Ayres and Andrew Young, eds, ''The Cambridge History of Early Christian Literature'', (2010), 286&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Panarion'' was first translated into English in 1987 and 1990.

===Other works===
His earliest known work is the ''Ancoratus'' (the well anchored man), which includes arguments against [[Arianism]] and the teachings of [[Origen]]. Aside from the [[polemics]] by which he is known, Epiphanius wrote a work of biblical [[antiquarian]]ism, called, for one of its sections, ''[[On Weights and Measures (Epiphanius)|On Weights and Measures]]'' (περὶ μέτρων καὶ στάθμων). It was composed in Constantinople for a Persian priest, in 392,&lt;ref&gt;Allen A. Shaw, "On Measures and Weights by Epiphanius" ''National Mathematics Magazine'' '''11'''.1 (October 1936: 3–7).&lt;/ref&gt; and survives in Syriac, Armenian, and Georgian translations (this last is found in ''Shatberd ms 1141'' along with ''Physiologus'' and ''De Gemmis'').&lt;ref&gt;English translation is Dean (1935)&lt;/ref&gt; The first section discusses the canon of the [[Old Testament]] and its versions, the second of measures and weights, and the third, the geography of [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]. The texts appear not to have been given a polish but consist of rough notes and sketches, as Allen A. Shaw, a modern commentator, concluded; nevertheless Epiphanius' work on [[metrology]] was important in the [[history of measurement]].

Another work, ''On the Twelve Gems'' (''De Gemmis''), survives in a number of fragments, the most complete of which is the Georgian.&lt;ref&gt;Frances Young with Andrew Teal, ''From Nicaea to Chalcedon: A Guide to the Literature and its Background’’, (2nd edn, 2004), p201&lt;/ref&gt;  The letter written by Epiphanius to John, Bishop of Jerusalem, in 394 and preserved in Jerome's translation, is discussed above.&lt;ref&gt;''Ep'' 51, available at http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf206.v.LI.html&lt;/ref&gt;  The collection of [[homily|homilies]] traditionally ascribed to a "Saint Epiphanius, bishop" are dated in the late fifth or sixth century and are not connected with Epiphanius of Salamis by modern scholars.&lt;ref&gt;Alvar Erikson, ''Sancti Epiphani Episcopi Interpretatio Evangelorum'' (Lund) 1938, following Dom Morin.&lt;/ref&gt;

Such was Epiphanius's reputation for learning that the ''[[Physiologus]]'', the principal source of medieval bestiaries, came to be widely falsely attributed to him.&lt;ref&gt;Frances Young with Andrew Teal, ''From Nicaea to Chalcedon: A Guide to the Literature and its Background’’, (2nd edn, 2004), p202&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2263">'''Essays and Aphorisms on the Higher Man''' is the work of the American writer and philosopher, [[Emile Benoit (writer)]]. 

The Foreword Clarion Review writes that "History has shown examples of man trying to pull himself out of his ignorant bliss and stagnancy, from the philosopher kings and Renaissance man to Nietzsche's Superman. A scant number of individuals have dared to become something more by the unremitting quest for knowledge gained from the arts, religion, philosophy, etc., and the implementation of this knowledge across the broad spectrum of their lives and the lives of others…[H]umanity can go beyond Kant, Hume, Nietzsche's Superman, and the selfishness of Sartre's [[existential humanism]]. In a sense, he or she can become a "higher man." 

Benoit writes, "The evolution of the species will be when man can incorporate and digest all of his religions and live wholly, honestly and peacefully with himself and others…when he accepts all the religions, arts, and sciences as expressions of human greatness; a time when even the truth will no longer be an eternal proposition but simply an expression of mankind’s prominence at making the incomprehensible understood – if but only briefly." 

As Benoit writes in the preface of the book, his intention is "to inspire, rather than impose, to incite rather than allow man to settle into a comfortable repose, delighted with himself." The book has won critical acclaim from reviewers &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theusreview.com/reviews/Essays-Benoit.html U.S Review of Books]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/dp/0578075253 Midwest Book Review]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as New York Times bestselling authors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jamesgeary.com/blog/aphorisms-by-emile-benoit/ James Geary]&lt;/ref&gt;

 In a review from [[ForeWord (magazine)]] Lee Gordon writes: "With the brevity of Confucius, the beauty, depth, wit and wisdom of the poet Rumi, and his own succinct, lyrical language, Benoit writes about the human condition."

[[Image:Fayum-35.jpg|thumb|upright|The single specimen of Gayet's mummy portraits from Antinoopolis for which information on its archaeological context is available. The heavily gilt portrait was found in winter 1905/06 and sold to [[Berlin]] in 1907. [[Egyptian Museum of Berlin|Berlin, Egyptian Museum.]]]]
'''Mummy portraits''' or '''Fayum mummy portraits''' (also '''Faiyum mummy portraits''') is the modern term given to a type of naturalistic painted [[portrait]] on wooden boards attached to [[Upper Class|Upper class]] [[mummy|mummies]] from [[Roman Egypt]]. They belong to the tradition of [[panel painting]], one of the most highly regarded forms of art in the [[Classical antiquity|Classical world]]. The Fayum portraits are the only large body of art from that tradition to have survived.

Mummy portraits have been found across [[Egypt]], but are most common in the [[Faiyum Oasis|Faiyum Basin]], particularly from [[Hawara]] in the Fayum Basin (hence the common name) and the [[Hadrian]]ic [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] city [[Antinoopolis]]. "Faiyum Portraits" is generally used as a stylistic, rather than a geographic, description. While painted [[cartonnage]] mummy cases date back to pharaonic times, the Faiyum mummy portraits were an innovation dating to the time of the [[Roman Empire|Roman occupation of Egypt]].&lt;ref&gt;Berman, Lawrence, Freed, Rita E., and Doxey, Denise. &lt;cite&gt;Arts of Ancient Egypt&lt;/cite&gt;. p.193. Museum of Fine Arts Boston. 2003. {{ISBN|0-87846-661-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The portraits date to the [[Roman Empire|Imperial Roman era]], from the late 1st century BC or the early 1st century AD onwards. It is not clear when their production ended, but recent research suggests the middle of the 3rd century. They are among the largest groups among the very few survivors of the [[panel painting]] tradition of the classical world, which was continued into [[Byzantine art|Byzantine]] and Western traditions in the post-classical world, including the local tradition of [[Coptic art|Coptic iconography]] in Egypt.

The portraits covered the faces of bodies that were mummified for burial. Extant examples indicate that they were mounted into the bands of cloth that were used to wrap the bodies. Almost all have now been detached from the mummies.&lt;ref&gt;Examples still attached are in the [[Egyptian Museum]], [[Cairo]] and the British Museum&lt;/ref&gt; They usually depict a single person, showing the head, or head and upper chest, viewed frontally. In terms of artistic tradition, the images clearly derive more from [[Greco-Roman world|Greco-Roman]] [[Ancient Roman art|artistic traditions]] than [[Ancient Egyptian art|Egyptian ones]].&lt;ref&gt;Oakes, Lorna. Gahlin, Lucia. &lt;cite&gt;Ancient Egypt: An Illustrated Reference to the Myths, Religions, Pyramids and Temples of the Land of the Pharaohs&lt;/cite&gt;. p.236 Hermes House. 2002. {{ISBN|1-84477-008-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two groups of portraits can be distinguished by technique: one of [[encaustic painting|encaustic]] (wax) paintings, the other in [[tempera]]. The former are usually of higher quality.

About 900 mummy portraits are known at present.&lt;ref&gt;Corpus of all known specimens: Klaus Parlasca: ''Ritratti di mummie'', Repertorio d'arte dell'Egitto greco-romano Vol. B, 1-4, Rome 1969-2003; a further specimen discovered since: Petrie Museum UC 79360, B. T. Trope, S. Quirke, P. Lacovara: ''Excavating Egypt'', Atlanta 2005, p. 101, {{ISBN|1-928917-06-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority were found in the [[necropolis|necropoleis]] of Faiyum. Due to the hot dry Egyptian climate, the paintings are frequently very well preserved, often retaining their brilliant colours seemingly unfaded by time.

== History of research ==
[[Image:Engraving of finding mummies in Sakkara by Pietro Della Valle.gif|thumb|upright|Fanciful but inauthentic depiction of the mummies' discovery by Pietro Della Valle]]

===Pre-19th century===
The Italian explorer [[Pietro della Valle]], on a visit to [[Saqqara]]-[[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]] in 1615, was the first European to discover and describe mummy portraits. He transported some mummies with portraits to Europe, which are now in the [[Albertinum]] ([[Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden]]).&lt;ref name="Borg 10"&gt;Barbara Borg: ''"Der zierlichste Anblick der Welt ...". Ägyptische Porträtmumien'', Mainz 1998, p. 10f.&lt;/ref&gt;

===19th century collectors===
Although interest in Ancient Egypt steadily increased after that period, further finds of mummy portraits did not become known before the early 19th century. The provenance of these first new finds is unclear; they may come from [[Saqqara]] as well, or perhaps from [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]]. In 1820, the Baron of Minotuli acquired several mummy portraits for a German collector, but they became part of a whole shipload of Egyptian artifacts lost in the [[North Sea]]. In 1827, Léon de Laborde brought two portraits, supposedly found in Memphis, to Europe, one of which can today be seen at the [[Louvre]], the other in the [[British Museum]]. [[Ippolito Rosellini]], a member of [[Jean-François Champollion]]'s 1828/29 expedition to Egypt, brought a further portrait back to [[Florence]]. It is so similar to de Laborde's specimens that it is thought to be from the same source.&lt;ref name="Borg 10"/&gt; During the 1820s, the British [[Consul General]] to Egypt, [[Henry Salt (Egyptologist)|Henry Salt]], sent several further portraits to [[Paris]] and [[London]]. Some of them were long considered portraits of the family of the Theban [[Archon]] Pollios Soter, a historical character known from written sources, but this has turned out to be incorrect.&lt;ref name="Borg 10"/&gt;

Once again, a long period elapsed before more mummy portraits came to light. In 1887, Daniel Marie Fouquet heard of the discovery of numerous portrait mummies in a cave. He set off to inspect them some days later, but arrived too late, as the finders had used the painted plaques for firewood during the three previous cold desert nights. Fouquet acquired the remaining two of what had originally been fifty portraits. While the exact location of this find is unclear, the likely source is from er-Rubayat.&lt;ref name="Borg 10"/&gt; At that location, not long after Fouquet's visit, the Viennese art trader Theodor Graf found several further images, which he tried to sell as profitably as possible. He engaged the famous [[Leipzig]]-based [[Egyptologist]] [[Georg Ebers]] to publish his finds. He produced presentation folders to advertise his individual finds throughout Europe. Although little was known about their archaeological find contexts, Graf went as far as to ascribe the portraits to known [[Ptolemaic dynasty|Ptolemaic]] pharaohs by analogy with other works of art, mainly coin portraits. None of these associations were particularly well argued or convincing, but they gained him much attention, not least because he gained the support of well-known scholars like [[Rudolf Virchow]]. As a result, mummy portraits became the centre of much attention.&lt;ref name="Barbara Borg 1998"&gt;Barbara Borg: ''"Der zierlichste Anblick der Welt ...". Ägyptische Porträtmumien'', Mainz 1998, p. 13f., 34ff.&lt;/ref&gt; By the late 19th century, their very specific aesthetic made them sought-after collection pieces, distributed by the global arts trade.

===Archaeological study: Flinders Petrie===
[[Image:Fayum-07.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Detail of a portrait within its mummy wrappings, [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], discovered by Flinders Petrie in 1911.]]
In parallel, more scientific engagement with the portraits was beginning. In 1887, the British archaeologist [[Flinders Petrie]] started [[Excavation (archaeology)|excavations]] at [[Hawara]]. He discovered a Roman [[necropolis]] which yielded 81 portrait mummies in the first year of excavation. At an exhibition in London, these portraits drew large crowds. In the following year, Petrie continued excavations at the same location but now suffered from the competition of a German and an Egyptian art dealer. Petrie returned in the winter of 1910/11 and excavated a further 70 portrait mummies, some of them quite badly preserved.&lt;ref&gt;Petrie: ''Roman Portraits and Memphis IV'', p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; With very few exceptions, Petrie's studies still provide the only examples of mummy portraits so far found as the result of systematic excavation and published properly. Although the published studies are not entirely up to modern standards, they remain the most important source for the find contexts of portrait mummies.

===Late 19th and early 20th century collectors===
In 1892, the German archaeologist von Kaufmann discovered the so-called "[[Tomb of Aline]]", which held three mummy portraits; among the most famous today. Other important sources of such finds are at [[Antinopolis]] and [[Akhmim]]. The French archaeologist Albert Gayet worked at Antinoopolis and found much relevant material, but his work, like that of many of his contemporaries, does not satisfy modern standards. His documentation is incomplete, many of his finds remain without context.

===Museums===
Today, mummy portraits are represented in all important archaeological museums of the world. Many have fine examples on display, notably the [[British Museum]], the [[National Museum of Scotland]], the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York and the [[Louvre]] in Paris.&lt;ref name="Hoesch"&gt;Nicola Hoesch: ''Mumienporträts'' in: ''[[Pauly-Wissowa|Der Neue Pauly]], Bd. 8 (2000), p. 464&lt;/ref&gt; Because they were mostly recovered through inappropriate and unprofessional means, virtually all are without archaeological context, a fact which consistently lowers the quality of archaeological and culture-historical information they provide. As a result, their overall significance as well as their specific interpretations remain controversial.&lt;ref name="Hoesch"/&gt;

== Materials and techniques ==
A majority of images show a formal portrait of a single figure, facing and looking toward the viewer, from an angle that is usually slightly turned from full face. The figures are presented as busts against a monochrome background which in some instances are decorated. The individuals are both male and female and range in age from childhood to old age.

===Painted surface===
[[File:Portrait of the Boy Eutyches - Metmuseum 18.9.2.jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait of a boy, identified by inscription as Eutyches, [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]]]
The majority of preserved mummy portraits were painted on boards or panels, made from different imported hardwoods, including [[oak]], [[Lime tree|lime]], [[sycamore]], [[Cedrus|cedar]], [[cypress]], [[ficus|fig]], and [[citrus]].&lt;ref&gt;Wrede, LÄ IV, 218&lt;/ref&gt; The wood was cut into thin rectangular panels and made smooth. The finished panels were set into layers of wrapping that enclosed the body and were surrounded by bands of cloth, giving the effect of a window-like opening through which the face of the deceased could be seen. Portraits were sometimes painted directly onto the canvas or rags of the mummy wrapping ([[cartonnage]] painting).

===Painting techniques===
The wooden surface was sometimes primed for painting with a layer of plaster. In some cases the primed layer reveals a preparatory drawing.
Two painting techniques were employed: [[encaustic painting|encaustic]] (wax) painting and animal glue [[tempera]].  The encaustic images are striking because of the  contrast between vivid and rich colours, and comparatively large brush-strokes, producing an "[[Impressionistic]]" effect. The tempera paintings have a finer gradation of tones and chalkier colours, giving a more restrained appearance.&lt;ref name="Hoesch"/&gt; In some cases, [[gold leaf]] was used to depict jewellery and wreaths. There also are examples of hybrid techniques or of variations from the main techniques.

The Fayum portraits reveal a wide range of painterly expertise and skill in presenting a lifelike appearance. The naturalism of the portraits is often revealed in knowledge of anatomic structure and in skilled modelling of the form by the use of light and shade, which gives an appearance of three-dimensionality to most of the figures. The graded flesh tones are enhanced with shadows and highlights indicative of directional lighting.

==Subjects and social context of the paintings==

===People of Fayum===
Under Greco-Roman rule, Egypt hosted several [[Greeks|Greek]] settlements, mostly concentrated in [[Alexandria]], but also in a few other cities, where Greek settlers lived alongside some seven to ten million native [[Egyptians]].&lt;ref&gt;Adams, Winthrope L in Bugh, Glenn Richard. ed. "The Hellenistic Kingdoms". ''The Cambridge Companion to the Hellenistic World''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. 2006, p. 39&lt;/ref&gt; Faiyum's earliest Greek inhabitants were soldier-veterans and ''cleruchs'' (elite military officials) who were settled by the Ptolemaic kings on reclaimed lands.&lt;ref&gt;Stanwick, Paul Edmund. ''Portraits of the Ptolemies: Greek Kings as Egyptian Pharaohs.'' Austin: University of Texas Press. 2003, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Adams, ''op cit.''&lt;/ref&gt; Native Egyptians also came to settle in Faiyum from all over the country, notably the [[Nile Delta]], [[Upper and Lower Egypt|Upper Egypt]], [[Oxyrhynchus]] and [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]], to undertake the labor involved in the land reclamation process, as attested by personal names, local cults and recovered [[papyrus|papyri]].&lt;ref&gt;Bagnall, R.S. in Susan Walker, ed. ''Ancient Faces : Mummy Portraits in Roman Egypt'' (Metropolitan Museum of Art Publications). New York: Routledge, 2000, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that as much as 30 percent of the population of Faiyum was Greek during the [[Ptolemaic Egypt|Ptolemaic]] period, with the rest being native Egyptians.&lt;ref name="Bagnall, op cit."&gt;Bagnall, ''op cit.''&lt;/ref&gt; By the Roman period, much of the "Greek" population of Faiyum was made-up of either Hellenized Egyptians or people of mixed Egyptian-Greek origins.&lt;ref&gt;Bagnall, pp. 28–29&lt;/ref&gt; Later, in the Roman Period, many veterans of the Roman army, who, initially at least, were not Egyptian but people from disparate cultural backgrounds, settled in the area after the completion of their service, and formed social relations and intermarried with local populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Alston|first1=R.|title=Soldier and Society in Roman Egypt: A Social History|date=1995|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While commonly believed to represent Greek settlers in Egypt,&lt;ref name="egyptologyonline"&gt;[https://www.egyptologyonline.com/mummy_portraits.htm Egyptology Online: Fayoum mummy portraits] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070808184841/https://www.egyptologyonline.com/mummy_portraits.htm |date=2007-08-08 }} accessed on January 16, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="britannica"&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/eb/article-59912/Egyptian-art-and-architecture/ Encyclopædia Britannica Online - Egyptian art and architecture - Greco-Roman Egypt] accessed on January 16, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; the Faiyum portraits instead reflect the complex synthesis of the predominant Egyptian culture and that of the elite Greek minority in the city.&lt;ref name="Bagnall, op cit."/&gt; According to Walker, the early Ptolemaic Greek colonists married local women and adopted Egyptian religious beliefs, and by Roman times, their descendants were viewed as Egyptians by the Roman rulers, despite their own self-perception of being Greek.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, Susan, ''op cit.'', p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; The dental morphology&lt;ref&gt;Dentition helps archaeologists to assess biological and ethnic population traits and relationships&lt;/ref&gt; of the Roman-period Faiyum mummies was also compared with that of earlier Egyptian populations, and was found to be "much more closely akin" to that of ancient Egyptians than to Greeks or other European populations.&lt;ref&gt;Irish JD (2006). "Who were the ancient Egyptians? Dental affinities among Neolithic through postdynastic peoples.". ''Am J Phys Anthropol'' 129 (4): 529–543&lt;/ref&gt;

The portraits represent native Egyptians, some of whom had adopted Greek or Latin names, then seen as ‘status symbols’.&lt;ref&gt;Broux, Y. Double Names and Elite Strategy in Roman Egypt. Studia Hellenistica 54 (Peeters Publishers, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Coussement, S. ‘Because I am Greek’: Polynymy as an Expression of Ethnicity in Ptolemaic Egypt. Studia Hellenistica 55 (Peeters Publishers, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Riggs, C. The Beautiful Burial in Roman Egypt: Art, Identity, and Funerary Religion Oxford University Press (2005).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Katz 184"&gt;Victor J. Katz (1998). ''A History of Mathematics: An Introduction'', p. 184. Addison Wesley, {{ISBN|0-321-01618-1}}: "''But what we really want to know is to what extent the Alexandrian mathematicians of the period from the first to the fifth centuries C.E. were Greek. Certainly, all of them wrote in Greek and were part of the Greek intellectual community of Alexandria. And most modern studies conclude that the Greek community coexisted [...] So should we assume that [[Ptolemy]] and [[Diophantus]], [[Pappus of Alexandria|Pappus]] and [[Hypatia]] were ethnically Greek, that their ancestors had come from Greece at some point in the past but had remained effectively isolated from the Egyptians? It is, of course, impossible to answer this question definitively. But research in papyri dating from the early centuries of the common era demonstrates that a significant amount of intermarriage took place between the Greek and Egyptian communities [...] And it is known that Greek marriage contracts increasingly came to resemble Egyptian ones. In addition, even from the founding of Alexandria, small numbers of Egyptians were admitted to the privileged classes in the city to fulfill numerous civic roles. Of course, it was essential in such cases for the Egyptians to become "Hellenized," to adopt Greek habits and the Greek language. Given that the Alexandrian mathematicians mentioned here were active several hundred years after the founding of the city, it would seem at least equally possible that they were ethnically Egyptian as that they remained ethnically Greek. In any case, it is unreasonable to portray them with purely European features when no physical descriptions exist.''"&lt;/ref&gt; DNA studies show genetic continuity between the Pre-Ptolemaic, Ptolemaic and Roman populations, indicating that foreign rule impacted the town’s population only to a very limited degree at the genetic level.&lt;ref name=Verena/&gt;

===Age profile of those depicted===
[[Image:Fayum-22.jpg|thumb|upright|Man with sword belt, [[British Museum]].]]
Most of the portraits depict the deceased at a relatively young age, and many show children. According to Walker, [[Computed tomography|C.A.T.]] scans  reveal a correspondence of age and sex between mummy and image. He concludes that the age distribution reflects the low life expectancy at the time. It was often believed that the wax portraits were completed during the life of the individual and displayed in their home, a custom that belonged to the traditions of [[Greek art]],&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia Of Ancient Greece'', Nigel Guy, Routledge Taylor and Francis group, p. 601&lt;/ref&gt; but this view is no longer widely held given the evidence suggested by the C.A.T. scans of the Faiyum mummies, as well as Roman census returns. In addition, some portraits were painted directly onto the coffin; for example, on a shroud or another part.

===Social status===
The patrons of the portraits apparently belonged to the affluent upper class of military personnel, civil servants and religious dignitaries. Not everyone could afford a mummy portrait; many mummies were found without one. Flinders Petrie states that only one or two per cent of the mummies he excavated were embellished with portraits.&lt;ref name="Borg 58"&gt;Barbara Borg: ''"Der zierlichste Anblick der Welt ...". Ägyptische Porträtmumien'', Mainz 1998, p. 58&lt;/ref&gt; The rates for mummy portraits do not survive, but it can be assumed that the material caused higher costs than the labour, since in antiquity, painters were appreciated as craftsmen rather than as artists.&lt;ref name="Borg 58"/&gt; The situation from the "[[Tomb of Aline]]" is interesting in this regard. It contained four mummies: those of Aline, of two children and of her husband. Unlike his wife and children, the latter was not equipped with a portrait but with a gilt three-dimensional mask. Perhaps plaster masks were preferred if they could be afforded.

[[Image:FuneraryMasksRomanEgypt.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Three-dimensional funerary masks of painted plaster from Faiyum (1st century), [[Montreal Museum of Fine Arts]].]]

Based on literary, archaeological and genetic studies, it appears that those depicted were native Egyptians, who had adopted the dominant Greco-Roman culture.&lt;ref name=Verena&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schuenemann|first1=Verena|last2=Peltzer|first2=Alexander|last3=Welte|first3=Beatrix|title=Ancient Egyptian mummy genomes suggest an increase of Sub-Saharan African ancestry in post-Roman periods|journal=Nature Communications|date=30 May 2017|doi=10.1038/ncomms15694|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms15694}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name of some of those portrayed are known from inscriptions, they are predominantly Greek. Hairstyles and clothing are always influenced by Roman fashion. Women and children are often depicted wearing valuable ornaments and fine garments, men often wearing specific and elaborate outfits. Greek inscriptions of names are relatively common, sometimes they include professions. It is not known whether such inscriptions always reflect reality, or whether they may state ideal conditions or aspirations rather than true conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Nicola Hoesch: "Mumienporträts'"in: ''[[Pauly-Wissowa|Der Neue Pauly]]'', Bd. 8 (2000), p. 465&lt;/ref&gt; One single inscription is known to definitely indicate the deceased's profession (a shipowner) correctly. The mummy of a woman named Hermione also included the term ''grammatike'' (γραμματική). For a long time, it was assumed that this indicated that she was a teacher by profession (for this reason, Flinders Petrie donated the portrait to [[Girton College]], [[Cambridge]], the first residential college for women in [[United Kingdom|Britain]]), but today, it is assumed that the term indicates her level of education. Some portraits of men show sword-belts or even pommels, suggesting that they were members of the Roman military.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Borg: ''"Der zierlichste Anblick der Welt ...". Ägyptische Porträtmumien'', Mainz 1998, pp. 53–55&lt;/ref&gt;

===Changes in burial habits===
The burial habits of [[Ptolemaic Dynasty|Ptolemaic]] Egyptians mostly followed ancient traditions. The bodies of members of the upper classes were [[mummy|mummified]], equipped with a decorated coffin and a mummy mask to cover the head. The [[Greeks]] who entered Egypt at that time mostly followed their own habits. There is evidence from [[Alexandria]] and other sites indicating that they practised the Greek tradition of [[cremation]]. This broadly reflects the general situation in [[Hellenistic]] Egypt, its rulers proclaiming themselves to be [[pharaoh]]s but otherwise living in an entirely Hellenistic world, incorporating only very few local elements. Conversely, the Egyptians only slowly developed an interest in the Greek-Hellenic culture that dominated the [[East Mediterranean]] since the conquests of [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]]. This situation changed substantially with the arrival of the Romans. Within a few generations, all Egyptian elements disappeared from everyday life. Cities like [[Karanis]] or [[Oxyrhynchus]] are largely Graeco-Roman places. There is clear evidence that this resulted from a mixing of different ethnicities in the ruling classes of Roman Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Borg: ''"Der zierlichste Anblick der Welt ...".

===Religious continuity===
Only in the sphere of religion is there evidence for a continuation of Egyptian traditions. Egyptian temples were erected as late as the 2nd century. In terms of burial habits, Egyptian and Hellenistic elements now mixed. Coffins became increasingly unpopular and went entirely out of use by the 2nd century. In contrast, mummification appears to have been practised by large parts of the population. The mummy mask, originally an Egyptian concept, grew more and more Graeco-Roman in style, Egyptian motifs became ever rarer. The adoption of Roman portrait painting into Egyptian burial cult belongs into this general context.&lt;ref&gt;summarised in: Judith A. Corbelli: ''The Art of Death in Graeco-Roman Egypt'', Princes Risborough 2006 {{ISBN|0-7478-0647-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Link with Roman funeral masks?===
Some authors suggest that the idea of such portraits may be related to the custom among the [[nobiles|Roman nobility]] of displaying ''[[Roman funerals and burial#Imagines|imagines]]'', images of their ancestors, in the [[domus|atrium of their house]]. In funeral processions, these wax masks were worn by professional mourners to emphasize the continuity of an illustrious family line, but originally perhaps to represent a deeper evocation of the presence of the dead. [[Roman festivals]] such as the [[Parentalia]] as well as [[Religion in ancient Rome#Domestic and private cult|everyday domestic rituals]] cultivated ancestral spirits (see also [[veneration of the dead]]). The development of mummy portraiture may represent a combination of Egyptian and [[Roman funerals and burial|Roman funerary tradition]], since it appears only after Egypt was established as a [[Roman province]].&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Borg: ''"Der zierlichste Anblick der Welt ...". Ägyptische Porträtmumien'', Mainz 1998, p. 78&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Salon paintings"?===
The images depict the heads or busts of men, women and children. They probably date from c. 30 BC to the 3rd century.&lt;ref&gt;Nicola Hoesch: ''Mumienporträts'' in: ''Der Neue Pauly'', Vol. 8 (2000), p. 464; others scholars, e.g. Barbara Borg suggest that they start under [[Tiberius]].&lt;/ref&gt; To the modern eye, the portraits appear highly individualistic. Therefore, it has been assumed for a long time that they were produced during the lifetime of their subjects and displayed as "salon paintings" within their houses, to be added to their mummy wrapping after their death. Newer research rather suggests that they were only painted after death,&lt;ref name="Hoesch"/&gt; an idea perhaps contradicted by the multiple paintings on some specimens and the (suggested) change of specific details on others. The individualism of those depicted was actually created by variations in some specific details, within a largely unvaried general scheme.&lt;ref name="Hoesch"/&gt; The habit of depicting the deceased was not a new one, but the painted images gradually replaced the earlier Egyptian masks, although the latter continued in use for some time, often occurring directly adjacent to portrait mummies, sometimes even in the same graves.

===Realism and convention===
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2013}}
Together with the painted [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan tombs]], the [[Lucanians|Lucanian]] tombs and the [[Tomb of the Diver]] in [[Paestum]], the frescoes from [[Pompeii]] and [[Herculaneum]] and the [[Greek vase]]s, they are the best preserved paintings from ancient times and are renowned for their remarkable [[naturalism (art)|naturalism]]. It is, however, debatable whether the portraits depict the subjects as they really were. Analyses have shown that the painters depicted faces according to conventions in a repetitive and formulaic way, albeit with a variety of hairstyles and beards. They appear to have worked from a number of standard types without making detailed observations of the unique facial proportions of specific individuals which give each face its own personality.

In the virtual absence of other panel paintings from the period in question, it is difficult to make firm statements about the stylistic context of the portraits. While it seems clear that they are not in continuity from Egyptian precedents, the same cannot be said for the northern shores of the Mediterranean, where such material is less likely to have survived, due to climatic conditions there. Evidence from frescoes, mosaics and other media suggests that stylistically, the mummy portraits broadly fit within the prevailing Graeco-Roman traditions then dominant around the Mediterranean.

==Coexistence with other burial habits==
The religious meaning of mummy portraits has not, so far, been fully explained, nor have associated grave rites. There is some indication that it developed from genuine Egyptian funerary rites, adapted by a multi-cultural ruling class.&lt;ref name="Hoesch"/&gt; The tradition of mummy portraits occurred from the [[Nile Delta|Delta]] to [[Nubia]], but it is striking that other funerary habits prevailed over portrait mummies at all sites except those in the Faiyum (and there especially Hawara and Achmim) and Antinoopolis. In most sites, different forms of burial coexisted. The choice of grave type may have been determined to a large extent by the financial means and status of the deceased, modified by local customs. Portrait mummies have been found both in rock-cut tombs and in freestanding built grave complexes, but also in shallow pits. It is striking that they are virtually never accompanied by any grave offerings, with the exception of occasional pots or sprays of flowers.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Borg: ''"Der zierlichste Anblick der Welt ...". Ägyptische Porträtmumien'', Mainz 1998, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt;

==End of the mummy portrait tradition==
[[Image:Fayum-20.jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait of a man]]
For a long time, it was assumed that the latest portraits belong to the end of the 4th century, but recent research has modified this view considerably, suggesting that the last wooden portraits belong to the middle, the last directly painted mummy wrappings to the second half of the 3rd century. It is commonly accepted that production reduced considerably since the beginning of the 3rd century. Several reasons for the decline of the mummy portrait have been suggested; no single reason should probably be isolated, rather, they should be seen as operating together.

*In the 3rd century the Roman Empire underwent a severe economic crisis, severely limiting the financial abilities of the upper classes. Although they continued to lavishly spend money on representation, they favoured public appearances, like games and festivals, over the production of portraits. However, other elements of sepulchral representation, like [[sarcophagi]], did continue.
*There is evidence of a religious crisis at the same time. This may not be as closely connected with the rise of Christianity as previously assumed. (The earlier suggestion of a 4th-century end to the portraits would coincide with the widespread distribution of Christianity in Egypt. Christianity also never banned mummification.) An increasing neglect of Egyptian temples is noticeable during the Roman imperial period, leading to a general drop in interest in all ancient religions.
*The [[Constitutio Antoniniana]], i.e. the granting of Roman citizenship to all free subjects changed the social structures of Egypt. For the first time, the individual cities gained a degree of self-administration. At the same time, the provincial upper classes changed in terms of both composition and inter-relations.
Thus, a combination of several factors appears to have led to changes of fashion and ritual. No clear causality can be asserted.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Borg: ''"Der zierlichste Anblick der Welt ...". Ägyptische Porträtmumien'', Mainz 1998, pp. 88–101&lt;/ref&gt;

Considering the limited nature of the current understanding of portrait mummies, it remains distinctly possible that future research will considerably modify the image presented here. For example, some scholars suspect that the centre of production of such finds, and thus the centre of the distinctive funerary tradition they represent, may have been located at Alexandria. New finds from [[Marina el-Alamein]] strongly support such a  view.&lt;ref name="Barbara Borg 1998"/&gt; In view of the near-total loss of Greek and Roman paintings, mummy portraits are today considered to be among the very rare examples of ancient art that can be seen to reflect "Great paintings" and especially Roman portrait painting.&lt;ref name="Hoesch"/&gt;

==Mummy portraits as sources on provincial Roman fashion==
[[Image:Fayum-13.jpg|thumb|upright|Depiction of a woman with curly hair, wearing a violet chiton and cloak and pendant earrings. [[British Museum]].]]

===Provincial fashions===
Mummy portraits depict a variety of different hairstyles. They are one of the main aids in dating the paintings. The majority of the deceased were depicted with hairstyles then in fashion. They are frequently similar to those depicted in [[sculpture]]. As part of Roman propaganda, such sculptures, especially those depicting the imperial family, were often displayed throughout the empire. Thus, they had a direct influence on the development of fashion. Nevertheless, the mummy portraits, as well as other finds, suggest that fashions lasted longer in the provinces than in the imperial court, or at least that diverse styles might coexist.

===Hairstyles===
Since Roman men tended to wear short-cropped hair, female hairstyles are a better source of evidence for changes in fashion. The female portraits suggest a coarse chronological scheme: Simple hairstyles with a central parting in the [[Tiberius|Tiberian]] period are followed by more complex ringlet hairstyles, nested plaits and [[toupee|curly toupées]] over the forehead in the late 1st century. Small oval nested plaits dominate the time of the [[Antonines]], simple central-parting hairstyles with a hairknot in the neck occur in the second half of the 2nd century. The time of [[Septimius Severus]] was characterised by [[toupée]]-like fluffy as well as strict, straight styles, followed by looped plaits on the crown of the head. The latter belong to the very final phase of mummy portraits, and have only been noted on a few mummy wrappings. It seems to be the case that curly hairstyles were especially popular in Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Borg: ''"Der zierlichste Anblick der Welt ...". Ägyptische Porträtmumien'', Mainz 1998, pp. 45–49&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Egyptian - Female Portrait Mask - Walters 325.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The plaited hairstyle of this elite woman makes it possible to date this painting to the reign of [[Trajan]] (AD 98 – 117). [[Walters Art Museum]], [[Baltimore]].]]

[[Image:Fayum-11.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Depiction of a woman with a ringlet hairstyle, an orange chiton with black bands and rod-shaped earrings. [[Royal Museum of Scotland]].]]

===Clothing===
Like the hairstyles, the clothing depicted also follows the general fashions of the Roman Empire, as known from statues and busts. Both men and women tend to wear a thin [[chiton (costume)|chiton]] as an undergarment. Above it, both sexes tend to wear a cloak, laid across the shoulders or wound around the torso. The males wear virtually exclusively white, while female clothing is often red or pink, but can also be yellow, white, blue or purple. The chiton often bears a decorative line (''[[laticlave|clavus]]''), occasionally light red or light green, also sometimes gold, but normally in dark colours. Some painted mummy wrappings from Antinoopolis depict garments with long sleeves and very wide ''clavi''. So far, not a single portrait has been definitely shown to depict the [[toga]], a key symbol of Roman citizenship. It should, however, be kept in mind that Greek cloaks and togas are draped very similarly on depictions of the 1st and early 2nd centuries. In the late 2nd and 3rd centuries, togas should be distinguishable, but fail to occur.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Borg: ''"Der zierlichste Anblick der Welt ...". Ägyptische Porträtmumien'', Mainz 1998, pp. 49–51&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jewelry===
Apart from the gold [[wreath]]s worn by many men, with very few exceptions, only women are depicted with jewellery. This generally accords with the common jewellery types of the Graeco-Roman East. Especially the Antinoopolis portraits depict simple gold link chains and massive gold rings. There are also depictions of [[precious stone|precious]] or [[semi-precious stones]] like [[emerald]], [[carnelian]], [[garnet]], [[agate]] or [[amethyst]], rarely also of [[pearl]]s. The stones were normally ground into cylindrical or spherical beads. Some portraits depict elaborate [[collier (necklace)|colliers]], with precious stones set in gold.

The gold wreath was apparently rarely, if ever, worn in life, but a number have been found in graves from much earlier periods. Based on the plant wreaths given as prizes in contests, the idea was apparently to celebrate the achievements of the deceased in life.

There are three basic shapes of ear ornaments: Especially common in the 1st century are circular or drop-shaped pendants. Archaeological finds indicate that these were fully or semi-spherical. Later tastes favoured S-shaped hooks of gold wire, on which up to five beads of different colours and materials could be strung. The third shape are elaborate pendants with a horizontal bar from which two or three, occasionally four, vertical rods are suspended, usually each decorated with a white bead or pearl at the bottom. Other common ornaments include gold hairpins, often decorated with pearls, fine [[diadem (personal wear)|diadems]], and, especially at Antinoopolis, gold [[hairnet]]s. Many portraits also depict [[amulet]]s and [[pendant]]s, perhaps with magical functions.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Borg: ''„Der zierlichste Anblick der Welt ....“ Ägyptische Porträtmumien'', Mainz 1998, pp. 51–52&lt;/ref&gt;

== Art-historical significance ==
[[Image:Septimusseverustondo.jpg|thumb|Tondo with images of Septimius Severus and his family. [[Antikensammlung Berlin]].]]
The mummy portraits have immense art-historical importance. Ancient sources indicate that [[panel painting]] (rather than [[wall painting]]), i.e. painting on wood or other mobile surfaces was held in high regard. But very few ancient panel paintings
survive. One of the few examples besides the mummy portraits is the [[Severan Tondo]], also from Egypt (around 200), which, like the mummy portraits, is believed to represent a provincial version of contemporary style.&lt;ref&gt;other examples: a framed portrait from Hawara (Walker, Bierbrier: ''Ancient Faces'', pp. 121–122, Nr. 117), the image of a man flanked by two deities from the same site (Walker, Bierbrier: ''Ancient Faces'', pp. 123–124, Nr. 119), or the 6th century BC panels from Pitsa in Greece [https://www.sikyon.com/sicyon/Painting/spainting_eg.html]&lt;/ref&gt;
Some aspects of the mummy portraits, especially their frontal perspective and their concentration on key facial features, strongly resemble later [[icon painting]]. A direct link has been suggested, but it should be kept in mind that the mummy portraits represent only a small part of a much wider Graeco-Roman tradition, the whole of which later bore an influence on [[Late Antiquity|Late Antique]] and [[Byzantine Art]].  A pair of panel "icons" of [[Serapis]] and [[Isis]] of comparable date (3rd century) and style are in the [[Getty Museum]] at [[Malibu, California|Malibu]];&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.aisthesis.de/wbock/bilder/4-9si.gif image]&lt;/ref&gt; as with the cult of [[Mithras]], earlier examples of cult images were sculptures or pottery figurines, but from the 3rd century reliefs and then painted images are found.&lt;ref&gt;[[Kurt Weitzmann]] in The Icon, 1982, Evans Brothers Ltd, London, p. 3, (trans of Le Icone, Montadori 1981), {{ISBN|0-237-45645-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Classic baby shoes.jpg|thumb|right|A 6-word story regarding a pair of baby shoes is considered an extreme example of [[flash fiction]].]]
'''"For sale: baby shoes, never worn."''' is the entirety of what has been described as a six-word story, making it an extreme example of what is called [[flash fiction]] or sudden fiction. Although it is often attributed to [[Ernest Hemingway]], the link to him is unsubstantiated and similar stories predate him.&lt;ref name="quote"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://quoteinvestigator.com/2013/01/28/baby-shoes/|author=Garson O’Toole|title=For Sale, Baby Shoes, Never Worn|publisher=quoteinvestigator.com|date=January 28, 2013|accessdate=19 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Haglund"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2013/01/31/for_sale_baby_shoes_never_worn_hemingway_probably_did_not_write_the_famous.html|title=Did Hemingway Really Write His Famous Six-Word Story?|last=Haglund|first=David|date= Jan 31, 2013|publisher=Slate|accessdate=14 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Setting ==
The claim of Hemingway's authorship originates in an unsubstantiated anecdote about a wager between him and other writers. In a 1992 letter to Canadian humorist [[John Robert Colombo]], science fiction writer [[Arthur C. Clarke]] recounts it thus: While lunching with friends at a restaurant (variously identified as [[Luchow's]] or [[Algonquin Hotel|The Algonquin]]), Hemingway bets the table ten dollars each that he can craft an entire story in six words. After the pot is assembled, Hemingway writes "For sale: baby shoes, never worn" on a napkin, passes this around the table, and collects his winnings.&lt;ref name="quote" /&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Babys Clothes Never Worn.png|thumb|300px|right|This May 16, 1910 article from ''The Spokane Press'' recounts an earlier advertisement which struck the author as particularly tragic.]]
The May 16, 1910, edition of ''The Spokane Press'' had an article titled "Tragedy of Baby's Death is Revealed in Sale of Clothes." At that time, Hemingway would only have been aged ten, and years away from beginning his writing career.&lt;ref name="quote" /&gt;

In 1917, William R. Kane published a piece in a periodical called ''The Editor'' where he outlined the basic idea of a grief-stricken woman who had lost her baby and even suggested the title of ''Little Shoes, Never Worn''.&lt;ref name="Haglund" /&gt; In his version of the story, the shoes are being given away rather than sold. He suggests that this would provide some measure of solace for the seller, as it would mean that another baby would at least benefit directly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rF04AQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22never+worn%22&amp;redir_esc=y#v=snippet&amp;|title=untitled|last=Kane|first=William R.|date=February 24, 1917|work=The Editor: The Journal of Information for Literary Workers, Volume 45, number 4|pages=175–176|accessdate=20 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1921, the story was already being parodied: the July issue of ''[[Judge (magazine)|Judge]]'' that year published a version that used a [[baby carriage]] instead of shoes; there, however, the narrator described contacting the seller to offer condolences, only to be told that the sale was due to the birth of twins rather than of a single child.&lt;ref name="quote" /&gt;

The earliest known connection to Hemingway was in 1991, thirty years after the author’s death.&lt;ref name="quote" /&gt; This attribution was in a book by Peter Miller called ''Get Published! Get Produced!: A Literary Agent’s Tips on How to Sell Your Writing''. He said he was told the story by a "well-established newspaper syndicator" in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Miller|first=Peter|title=Get Published! Get Produced!: A Literary Agent’s Tips on How to Sell Your Writing|publisher=SP Books|date=Mar 1, 1991|pages=27|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VqKAE2euEnMC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=Get%20Published!%20Get%20Produced!%3A%20A%20Literary%20Agent%E2%80%99s%20Tips%20on%20How%20to%20Sell%20Your%20Writing&amp;pg=PA27#v=onepage&amp;q=baby&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, John Robert Colombo printed a letter from Arthur C. Clarke that repeated the story, complete with Hemingway having won $10 each from fellow writers.&lt;ref name="quote" /&gt;

This connection to Hemingway was reinforced by a one-man play called ''Papa'' by John deGroot, which debuted in 1996. Set during a ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine photo session in 1959, deGroot has the character utter the phrase as a means of illustrating Hemingway’s brevity.&lt;ref name="quote" /&gt; In ''[[Playbill]]'', deGroot defended his portrayal of Hemingway by saying, "Everything in the play is based on events as described by Ernest Hemingway, or those who knew him well. Whether or not these things actually happened is something we’ll never know truly. But Hemingway and many others claimed they did."&lt;ref name="snopes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/language/literary/babyshoes.asp|title=Baby Shoes|last1=Mikkelson |first1=David |last2=Mikkelson |first2=Barbara|date=29 October 2008|website=[[Snopes.com]] |accessdate=14 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legacy ==
The general concept of trying to tell a story with the absolute minimum of words became known by the general term of [[flash fiction]]. The six-word limit in particular has spawned the concept of [[Six-Word Memoirs]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/2100-500186_162-3876944.html|title=Six-Word Memoirs Can Say It All|date=February 11, 2009|publisher=CBS News|accessdate=20 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; including a collection published in book form in 2008 by ''[[Smith Magazine]]'', and two sequels published in 2009.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5609">'''Gynocriticism''' or '''gynocritics''' is the term coined in the seventies by [[Elaine Showalter]] to describe a new [[literary criticism|literary project]] intended to construct "a female framework for the analysis of women's literature".

By expanding the historical study of [[women writers]] as a distinct literary tradition, gynocritics sought to develop new models based on the study of female experience to replace male models of literary creation, and so "map the territory"&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in J. Childers ed., ''The Columbia Dictionary of Modern Literary and Cultural Criticism'' (1995) p. 129&lt;/ref&gt; left unexplored in earlier literary criticisms.

==History==

While previous figures like [[Virginia Woolf]] and [[Simone de Beauvoir]] had already begun to review and evaluate the female image in literature,&lt;ref name="Barry"/&gt; and [[second-wave feminism]] had explored [[phallocentrism]] and [[sexism]] through a female reading of male authors, gynocriticism was designed as a "second phase" in feminist criticism – turning to a focus on, and interrogation of female authorship, images, the feminine experience and ideology, and the history and development of the female literary tradition.&lt;ref name="Xu"&gt;Xu, Y 2007, 'Contribution of gynocriticism to feminist criticism', US – China Foreign Language, vol. 5, no. 5, pp. 1 – 5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Barry"&gt;Barry, P 2009, Beginning theory; An introduction to literary and cultural theory, Manchester University Press, Manchester.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development as a literary critique ==

Gynocriticism also examines the female struggle for identity and the social construct of gender.&lt;ref name="Barry"/&gt;  According to Elaine Showalter,&lt;ref name="Barry"/&gt; gynocritics is the study of not only the female as a gender status but also the 'internalized consciousness' of the female. The uncovering of the female [[subculture]] and exposition of a female model is the intention of gynocriticism,&lt;ref name="Xu"/&gt; comprising recognition of a distinct female [[canon (basic principle)|canon]] where a female identity is sought free from the [[masculine]] definitions and oppositions.&lt;ref name="Xu"/&gt;

Gynocriticism accordingly challenged a Freudian psychoanalytic perspective whereby the female inherently suffers envy of men and feelings of inadequacy and injustice,&lt;ref name="Xu"/&gt; combined with feelings of intellectual inferiority.&lt;ref name="Frager"&gt;Frager, R &amp; Fadiman, J 2005, Personality and personal growth 6th ed, Pearson Prentice Hall, New Jersey.&lt;/ref&gt; Arguing that male 'phallic prejudice'&lt;ref name="Xu"/&gt; itself creates a female consciousness that demands a critique,&lt;ref name="Xu"/&gt; and that prejudice against the female incites a specific noesis that gets attributed to the female,&lt;ref name="Frager"/&gt; Gynocriticism stressed that this prejudice has concealed the female literary tradition to the point of imitating the masculine.&lt;ref name="Friedman"&gt;Friedman, Susan Stanford. Mappings : Feminism and the Cultural Geographies of Encounter. Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

==Achievements and limitations==
Gynocriticism helped reclaim from obscurity a vast body of early female writings, often published in [[Virago]],&lt;ref&gt;Patricia Waugh, ''Literary Theory and Criticism'' (2006) p. 328&lt;/ref&gt; as well as producing such feminist classics as ''[[The Madwoman in the Attic]]''.&lt;ref&gt;J. Childers ed., ''The Columbia Dictionary of Modern Literary and Cultural Criticism'' (1995) p. 129&lt;/ref&gt; However its very successes left it open to new challenges from within feminism. Poststructuralists complained that it fetishized the role of the [[The Death of the Author|author]], at the expense of the reader and the text, and that its grand narrative, setting up a female canon in opposition to the male, was [[essentialist]], and omitted differences and divisions among women, leaving out [[lesbian]]s and [[women of color]], for example.&lt;ref&gt;Literary Terms." Fall 2002. Montclair State University (students of ENGL 605: Literary Research). 05 Jun. 2005 &lt;http://english.montclair.edu/isaacs/605LitResearch/litermFA02.htm&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

Race, class, social interest, political inclination, religion and sexuality&lt;ref name="Xu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Friedman"/&gt; all arguably come into play in the construction of identity.&lt;ref name="Friedman"/&gt; Separating out such properties would create a [[one-dimensional]] view of the female, yet if gender and identity are merely constructs then it becomes difficult to assign any inherent qualities of nature or language to found a critique.&lt;ref name="Barry"/&gt;

Despite such limitations, gynocriticism offers a valuable interrogation of 'female' literature, through the study of sameness and difference in gender.&lt;ref name="Friedman"/&gt; While the term is rarely used in [[third-wave feminism]], the ''practices'' and canon establishment of gynocriticism continues to underpin [[feminist literary criticism]].&lt;ref&gt;I. Buchanan, ''A Dictionary of Critical Theory'' (2010) p. 215&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Thomasson''' or '''Hyperart Thomasson''' (Japanese: ''Tomason'' トマソン or ''Chōgeijutsu Tomason'' 超芸術トマソン) is a type of [[conceptual art]] named by the Japanese artist [[Akasegawa Genpei]] in the 1980s. It refers to a useless relic or structure that has been preserved as part of a building or the built environment, which has become a piece of art in itself. These objects, although having the appearance of pieces of conceptual art, were not created to be viewed as such. Akasegawa deemed them even more art-like than art itself, and named them "hyperart." In recent years there has been a resurgence of interest in Thomasson, especially since the publication of Akasegawa's work on the subject in English in 2010.&lt;ref name=fargo&gt;Akasegawa Genpei, [http://kaya.com/books/hyperart-thomasson/ ''Hyperart: Thomasson,''] translated by Matt Fargo, Kaya Press, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;
{{TOC limit|2}}

==Origin of the term==

The term Thomasson comes from the professional baseball player [[Gary Thomasson]], who was signed by the [[Yomiuri Giants]] for a record-breaking sum of money, and spent his final two seasons with the team (1981–1982) coming close to setting the league strikeout record before being benched.&lt;ref name=Prakash&gt;Prakash, Gyan and Kevin Michael Kruse, [https://books.google.co.jp/books?id=rDGd7HDMFp4C&amp;lpg=PA397&amp;dq=tomason%20art&amp;pg=PA397#v=onepage&amp;q=tomason%20art&amp;f=false ''The Spaces of the Modern City: Imaginaries, Politics, and Everyday Life''], 2008 p. 397 n25&lt;/ref&gt; Akasegawa viewed Thomasson's useless position on the team as a fitting analogy for "an object, part of a building, that was maintained in good condition, but with no purpose, to the point of becoming a work of art." &lt;ref name="Akasegawa"&gt;Akasegawa Genpei, [https://www.chikumashobo.co.jp/product/9784480021892/ ''Chōgeijutsu tomason,''] Chikuma Shobō, 1987&lt;/ref&gt;

In Japanese there is no differentiation between singular and plural versions of the noun ''Tomason'', therefore in English too, Thomasson can refer to one or many of these objects. In English, the term is sometimes spelled '''Tomason''', or '''Thomason'''.

==History==

Akasegawa discovered the first Thomasson in 1972, in [[Yotsuya]], [[Tokyo]] when he noticed a staircase that had no entranceway when one reached the top. The handlerail of the staircase, however, showed signs of repair, suggesting it was still being maintained despite the apparent uselessness of the staircase itself. The following year, Akasegawa discovered a boarded up ticket window at Ekoda station on the [[Seibu Ikebukuro Line]]. The plywood used to board up the window had been cut neatly to fit the curved stone tray of the ticket window, where it had been worn through years of use. Minami Shindō, a fellow artist and friend of Akasegawa also found a gateway at a hospital in [[Ochanomizu]] that had been completely filled up with concrete, whilst the gateway itself was still in good condition.

The artists gave these objects names such as "The pure staircase of Yotsuya," "The useless window of Ekoda" and "The useless gate of Ochanomizu" and referred to them collectively as "hyperart": their similar characteristics being "an object which, just like a piece of art, has no purpose in society, but also, just like a piece of art is preserved with care, to the point where it appears to be on display. However, these objects do not appear to have a creator, making them even more art-like than regular art."&lt;ref name="Akasegawa"/&gt; Hyperart cannot be created by an artist, but only found and recognized as such by an observer.

Those pieces of hyperart that were part of buildings or the built environment were given the name "Thomasson." The name was decided upon during a discussion between Akasegawa and his students during his class on "Modernology" (a concept created by [[Wajiro Kon]]). At that time, Gary Thomasson's strikeout record was at 132.

The concept of Thomasson was introduced to the general public in 1982, via a series of articles in the magazine ''Shashin Jidai'' (Photo Times), published by Byakuya-Shobō. The articles featured findings by Akasegawa's students from his "Modernology" class as well as photographs of those "objects" catalogued by Akasegawa himself, and those sent in by readers. The articles created a "Thomasson Boom" and the concept soon spread. The early Thomasson articles featured in ''Shashin Jidai'' were published by Byakuya-Shobō as a book entitled ''Chōgeijutsu Tomason''.&lt;ref name=byakuya&gt;Akasegawa Genpei, ''Chogeijutsu Tomason,'' Byakuya Shobō, 1985&lt;/ref&gt; The complete series of articles was later published as a paperback by [[Chikuma Shobō]] in 1987, using the same title.

==Influence==

The Thomasson boom after the publication of articles in ''Shashin Jidai'' had a big effect on students and young people interested in arts and the avant-garde. The word Thomasson even spread to people who did not understand what it referred to, in a kind of social phenomenon. The cover of ''Chōgeijutsu Tomason'' featured a lost neighborhood of Minato-ku in Tokyo, Tani-cho, which vanished due to land redevelopment. Whilst not directly related to Thomasson, the story of Tani embodied its spirit. Its use on the cover of the book had a large effect on the "Thomasson Boom." This case also showed the effects of the bubble economy on the city landscape.&lt;ref name=tanaka&gt;Jun Tanaka [http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09555803.2011.599125 "Decaying ‘swamp city’: the death of Shōwa and Tokyo"], Japan Forum, 23:2, 2011, 273-285&lt;/ref&gt; As historian Jordan Sand notes, cataloguing Thomasson was "a way of regaining some sense of the human imprint on the city in an era when that imprint was being rapidly erased."&lt;ref name=fargo/&gt;

In 1983 the Thomasson Observation Center held an exhibition entitled "Cityscape in Anguish" at Gallery 612 in [[Shinjuku]], displaying Akasegawa's paintings and photographs of Thomasson by Akasegawa, his students, and those sent in by readers of the magazine.  Various tie-in events such as Thomasson bus tours, lectures by Akasegawa, as well as coverage on the Japanese national broadcaster [[NHK]], and the publication, in 1987 of the complete "Chōgeijutsu Tomason," were the peak of the Thomasson Boom.

Around the same time, other artists and intellectuals were pursuing similar projects. [[Terunobu Fujimori]]'s work on Architecture Detectives, Hayashi Jōji's work cataloguing manhole covers, Minami Shinbo's collections of paper stickers, Ichigi Tsutomu's work on architectural fragments and other such collections, led to Chikuma Shobō publishing a book entitled ''Rojō kansatsugaku nyūmon,'' or "Manual on Street Observation" in 1986.&lt;ref name="Street Observation"&gt;Akasegawa Genpei, Minami Shinbō, Fujimori Terunobu (Editors) [https://www.chikumashobo.co.jp/product/9784480028181/ ''Rojō kansatsugaku nyūmon,''] Chikuma Shobō, 1986&lt;/ref&gt;  Alongside this, a Street Observation Society event was held to promote their work, along with a press conference.&lt;ref name=Daniell&gt;Daniell, Thomas “Just Looking: The Origins of the Street Observation Society”. [http://aabookshop.net/?wpsc-product=aa-files-64 ''AA Files'', no. 64], Architectural Association School of Architecture, 2012: 59–68&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Street Observation did appear to be something of a boom, it was not the same type of movement that had surrounded the activities of Akasegawa, his students, and their magazine articles.  After the arrival of the Street Observation Society, Thomasson disappeared from the public eye for a while, due in part to the fact that the Thomasson Observation Center, run by Akasegawa and his students, overwhelmed by press and public attention, stopped its activities soon after the boom reached its peak.

In the years immediately after the Thomasson boom, the concept was referenced in cinema and literature. In the film [[Patlabor: The Movie]] (1989) a scene featured the "Atom-bomb type" Thomasson. [[William Gibson]]'s 1993 SF novel [[Virtual Light]] also makes multiple references to Thomasson.&lt;ref name=Gibson&gt;William Gibson, [https://books.google.co.jp/books?id=HHYUGVbVUZYC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=tomason%20%2B%20akasegawa&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Virtual Light,''] Bantam, 1993 pp. 70, 72, 136, 352&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=apache&gt;Takayuki Tatsumi, [https://books.google.co.jp/books?id=0Dcxkm5u05YC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=Full%20Metal%20Apache%3A%20Transactions%20Between%20Cyberpunk%20Japan%20and%20Avant-Pop%20America&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q=thomasson&amp;f=false ''Full Metal Apache: Transactions Between Cyberpunk Japan and Avant-Pop America,''] Duke University Press, 2006, p. 119&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rediscovery==

In 2010 the Chikuma Shobō edition of ''Chōgeijutsu Tomason'' was translated into English by Matt Fargo and published as ''Hyperart:Thomasson.''&lt;ref name=fargo/&gt;  In 2012, the Thomasson Observation Center created a Facebook page, and started accepting posts on Thomasson via the internet. The posts were shared widely, and a special form was made available for download to fill out with details of newly discovered Thomasson. A new, internet-era Thomasson movement began. The book and concept have been covered by several English-language media outlets.&lt;ref name=citylab&gt;Citylab [http://www.citylab.com/design/2012/05/useless-and-defunct-city-objects-are-named-thomassons/2075/ Useless and Defunct City Objects Should Be Called... 'Thomassons'], August 12, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=percent&gt;99% Invisible, [http://99percentinvisible.org/episode/thomassons/ Episode 129, ''Thomassons,''] August 26, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=neojaponisme&gt;[http://neojaponisme.com/2008/01/28/roadside-observation/ Darryl Jingwen Wee, "Roadside Observation" ''Neojaponisme'' January 28th, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, the Thomasson Observation Center held a Grand Thomasson Exhibition at a gallery in [[Shinjuku]], [[Tokyo]] to celebrate the 31st anniversary of its founding.&lt;ref name=thomassonten&gt;[https://www.facebook.com/events/528018727281950/ Grand Thomasson Exhibition]&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian of modern Japan Jordan Sand's 2013 work, ''Tokyo Vernacular: Common Spaces, Local Histories, Found Objects,'' also discusses the Thomasson phenomenon in its third chapter, entitled "Deviant Properties: Street Observation Studies." &lt;ref name=sand&gt;Jordan Sand, [https://books.google.co.jp/books/about/Tokyo_Vernacular.html?id=CZqygyfqnpkC&amp;redir_esc=y ''Tokyo Vernacular: Common Spaces, Local Histories, Found Objects,''] University of California Press, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;  Sand also contributed an essay to the 2010 translation of ''Hyperart: Thomasson''.

In 2013 “La Poussière de soleils,” an exhibition in [[Brooklyn]] gallery Real Fine Arts, featured Thomasson in the form of a photocopy of Akasegawa's photograph of a door handle sticking out of a cement wall.&lt;ref name=artforum&gt;Lauren O'Neill-Butler, [https://artforum.com/inprint/issue=201309&amp;id=43560 "La Poussière de soleils,"] Artforum international 52.3, Nov 2013, p.290.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of Thomasson==
Based on the categories in Chikuma Shobō's "Thomasson Illustrated Encyclopedia" (''Tomason Daizukan'' トマソン大図鑑)&lt;ref name=Daizukan&gt;Akasegawa Genpei, [https://www.chikumashobo.co.jp/product/9784480032010/ ''Tomason daizukan: mu no maki,''] Chikuma Shobō, 1996; Akasegawa Genpei [https://www.chikumashobo.co.jp/product/9784480032027/ ''Tomason daizukan: kū no maki,']' Chikuma Shobō, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Useless Staircase===
(Japanese: ''Muyō kaidan'' 無用階段)

Also known as a Pure Staircase. A staircase that only goes up and down. Most used to have a door at the top. Some useless staircases exist that were useless right from completion, due to changes or mix-ups in the design.

===The Useless Doorway===
[[File:非常ドア (8401452825).jpg|thumb|Example of a Useless Doorway]]
(Japanese: ''Muyō mon'' 無用門)

Even though it has been blocked up, a Useless Doorway still maintains the majesty of its original purpose. In other cases, a Useless Doorway exists in a place that has no need for it, with no wall or fence around it.

===The Hisashi===
(Japanese: ''Hisashi'' ヒサシ)

Hisashi is the word for "eaves" in Japanese. This refers to useless eaves: ones that no longer have a window or door underneath them to protect from the rain.

===The Useless Window===
(Japanese: ''Muyō mado'', 無用窓)

A blocked up window: one which is still beautiful due to the care taken in blocking it up.

===The Nurikabe===
(Japanese: ''Nurikabe'' ヌリカベ)

Nurikabe is the word for "plaster wall" in Japanese. This overlaps with the Useless Doorway and Useless Window categories. It refers to a door or window that was meant to be completely sealed up with concrete, but a difference can still be seen between it and the surrounding area.

===The A-bomb type===
[[File:Genbaku Type Thomasson in Suruga Word.JPG|thumb|Example of an A-bomb Type Thomasson]]
(Japanese: ''Genbaku taipu'' 原爆タイプ)

A 2-D Thomasson. The outline of a building that remains in silhouette on a wall. This can be seen when a section of a tightly packed row of buildings is torn down. Cases that appear due to water are known as '''Hydrogen bombs''' (''Suibaku'' 水爆). Cases that appear when a hoarding or sign is torn down are known as '''Neutron bombs''' (''Chūseishibakudan'' 中性子爆弾).

===The Elevated type===
(Japanese: ''Kōsho'' 高所)

These objects are normal themselves, but exist in a higher than normal place, therefore seeming strange. For example, a door with a handle on the second floor of a wall. These often appear when staircases are torn down. They can also appear when a winch or crane is kept inside the building, but a standard door is used on the outside.

===The Outie===
(Japanese: ''Debeso'' でべそ)

A protrudence from a sealed up wall, such as a door knob or tap.

===The Uyama===
(Japanese: ''Uyama'' ウヤマ)

A sign or hoarding with letters missing. The first example of this was a shop sign which contained the words Uyama, but the rest of the lettering was missing, hence the name.

===The Castella===
(Japanese: ''Kasutera'' カステラ)

A cuboid protuberance from a wall, named after [[Castella]], a Japanese sponge cake. For example, a blocked up window which sticks out from the wall. The opposite of this, a sunken blocked up section, is known as a '''Reverse Castella'''.

===The Atago===
(Japanese: ''Atago'' アタゴ)

An object sticking out at the side of the road, with no clear purpose, possibly used to stop cars parking. The first example of this was found by Akasegawa whilst walking from [[Shinbashi]] to [[Atago, Minato, Tokyo|Atago]], hence the name.

===The Live Burial===
(Japanese: ''Ikiume'' 生き埋め)

A roadside object which is partly submerged in concrete.

===The Geological layer===
(Japanese: ''Chisō'' 地層)

A patch of ground that is different in height from that around it, usually where multiple construction works have taken place.

===The Boundary===
(Japanese: ''Kyōkai'' 境界)

A guardrail, fence or wall whose purpose is not immediately clear.

===The Twist===
(Japanese: ''Nejire'' ねじれ)

A part of a building which is normally meant to be straight, but is slightly twisted. Often seen when an object that was created to be used straight is used at an angle.

===The Abe Sada===
(Japanese: ''Abe Sada'' 阿部定)

The remains of a telephone pole cut down. The name refers to the [[Abe Sada]] Incident; a famous case from 1930s Japan in which a woman strangled her lover and then severed his genitalia with a kitchen knife.

===The Devouring Tree===
(Japanese: ''Monokūki'' もの喰う木)

A tree which absorbs part of a fence or wire whilst still growing. However, this is not a particularly rare phenomenon, and occurs quite often. If there is no human involvement then it cannot be called a Thomasson, just a natural phenomenon. This is also known as the '''Stubborn Nature Type''' (''shizen kohashi taipu'' 自然強しタイプ).

===The Useless Bridge===
[[File:Nikaryo Futago 06c2902qs.jpg|thumb|Example of a Useless Bridge]]
(Japanese: ''Muyō bashi'' 無用橋)

A bridge over a filled-in river, or a bridge that has become useless. In the case of some covered drains, a bridge is still necessary for cars or heavy vehicles to cross. In this case these could not be called Useless Bridges, as they only appear useless.

===The Pure type===
[[File:Tomason tunnel KaifuStation.JPG|thumb|Example of a Pure Tunnel]]
(Japanese: ''Junsui taipu'' 純粋タイプ)

An uncategorizable object whose use it is impossible to fathom. For example, the Pure Shutters, which open to reveal a blank wall, and the Pure Tunnel that exists without a surrounding hill. The Pure Staircase of Yotsuya belongs in this category.

===Evaporation===
(Japanese: ''Jōhatsu'' 蒸発)

The fading of color on a sign, or a monument with parts missing: an object whose meaning has become hard to work out. Cases often appear due to the long-lasting material of the object. This also often occurs when a sign's key phrases, painted in red for emphasis, disappear, leaving the rest of the sign hard to understand.

'''International TAKIFUJI Art Award''' is an art award for students who belong to the designated art schools.

The applicants are evaluated and screened based on their works produced during their studies, by their supervisors' recommendations, and by judges by the leading figures in Japan art world. Scholarships as "grants for production activities" are given to the winners who are selected by at least one from each school. It is hosted by Japan Traffic Culture Association, a nonprofit organization in Japan, and was established in 1980 as TAKIFUJI Art Award (later changed to International TAKIFUJI Art Award).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10622">'''Irrealism''' is a term that has been used by various writers in the fields of philosophy, literature, and art to denote specific modes of unreality and/or the problems in concretely defining reality.  While in philosophy the term specifically refers to a position put forward by the American philosopher [[Nelson Goodman]], in literature and art it refers to a variety of writers and movements.  If the term has nonetheless retained a certain consistency in its use across these fields and would-be movements, it perhaps reflects the word’s position in general English usage: though the standard dictionary definition of ''irreal'' gives it the same meaning as ''unreal'', ''irreal'' is very rarely used in comparison with ''unreal''.  Thus, it has generally been used to describe something which, while unreal, is so in a very specific or unusual fashion, usually one emphasizing not just the "not real," but some form of estrangement from our generally accepted sense of reality.

==Irrealism in Literature==

In literature, the term irrealism was first used extensively in the United States in the 1970s to describe the post-realist "new fiction" of writers such as [[Donald Barthelme]] or [[John Barth]].  More generally, it described the notion that all forms of writing could only "offer particular versions of reality rather than actual descriptions of it," and that a story need not offer a clear resolution at its end.  [[John Gardner (novelist)|John Gardner]], in ''The Art of Fiction'', cites in this context the work of Barthelme and its "seemingly limitless ability to manipulate [literary] techniques as modes of apprehension [which] apprehend nothing."&lt;ref&gt;(Gardner 1984)&lt;/ref&gt;   Though Barth, in a 1974 interview, stated, "irrealism—not antirealism or unrealism, but irrealism—is all that I would confidently predict is likely to characterize the prose fiction of the 1970s," &lt;ref&gt;(Bellamy 1974)&lt;/ref&gt; this did not prove to be the case.  Instead writing in the United States quickly returned to its realist orthodoxy and the term irrealism fell into disuse.

In recent years, however, the term has been revived in an attempt to describe and categorize, in literary and philosophical terms, how it is that the work of an irrealist writer differs from the work of writers in other, non-realistic genres (e.g., the fantasy of [[J.R.R. Tolkien]], the magical realism of [[Gabriel García Márquez]]) and what the significance of this difference is.  This can be seen in Dean Swinford's essay ''Defining irrealism: scientific development and allegorical possibility''.[http://cafeirreal.alicewhittenburg.com/review1a.htm]  Approaching the issue from a structuralist and narratological point of view, he has defined irrealism as a "peculiar mode of postmodern allegory" that has resulted from modernity’s fragmentation and dismantling of the well-ordered and coherent medieval system of symbol and allegory.  Thus a lion, when presented in a given context in medieval literature, could only be interpreted in a single, approved way.  Contemporary literary theory, however, denies the attribution of such fixed meanings.  According to Swinford, this change can be attributed in part to the fact that "science and technical culture have changed perceptions of the natural world, have significantly changed the natural world itself, thereby altering the vocabulary of symbols applicable to [[epistemological]] and allegorical attempts to understand it."  Thus irreal works such as [[Italo Calvino]]'s ''Cosmicomics'' and [[Jorge Luis Borges]]' ''Ficciones'' can be seen as an attempt to find a new allegorical language to explain our changed perceptions of the world that have been brought about by our scientific and technical culture, especially concepts such as quantum physics or the theory of relativity.  "The Irrealist work, then, operates within a given system," writes Swinford, "and attests to its plausibility, despite the fact that this system, and the world it represents, is often a mutation, an aberration."

The online journal ''[[The Cafe Irreal]]'' [http://www.cafeirreal.com/], on the other hand, has defined irrealism as being a type of existentialist literature in which the means are continually and absurdly rebelling against the ends that we have determined for them.&lt;ref&gt;Evans, G.S. and Alice Whittenburg, "After Kafka: Kafka Criticism and Scholarship as a Resource in an Attempt to Promulgate a New Literary Genre," ''Journal of the Kafka Society of America'', 31/32(1+2):18-26.&lt;/ref&gt; An example of this would be [[Franz Kafka]]'s story ''[[The Metamorphosis]]'', in which the salesman [[Gregor Samsa]]'s plans for supporting his family and rising up in rank by hard work and determination are suddenly thrown topsy-turvy by his sudden and inexplicable transformation into a man-sized insect.  Such fiction is said to emphasize the fact that human consciousness, being finite in nature, can never make complete sense of, or successfully order, a universe that is infinite in its aspects and possibilities.  Which is to say: as much as we might try to order our world with a certain set of norms and goals (which we consider our real world), the paradox of a finite consciousness in an infinite universe creates a zone of irreality ("that which is beyond the real") that offsets, opposes, or threatens the real world of the human subject.  Irrealist writing often highlights this irreality, and our strange fascination with it, by combining the unease we feel because the real world doesn't conform to our desires with the narrative quality of the dream state (where reality is constantly and inexplicably being undermined); it is thus said to communicate directly, "by feeling rather than articulation, the uncertainties inherent in human existence or, to put it another way... the irreconcilability between human aspiration and human reality." [http://cafeirreal.alicewhittenburg.com/what_is_irr.htm]  If the irreal story can be considered an allegory, then, it would be an allegory that is "so many pointers to an unknown meaning," in which the meaning is felt more than it is articulated or systematically analyzed.

==Irrealism in Art==

Various writers have addressed the question of Irrealism in Art.  Many salient observations on Irrealism in Art are found in Nelson Goodman's ''Languages of Art''.  Goodman himself produced some multimedia shows, one of which inspired by hockey and is entitled ''Hockey Seen: A Nightmare in Three Periods and Sudden Death''.

Garret [[Rowlan]], writing in ''[[The Cafe Irreal]]'', writes that the malaise present in the work of the Italian artist [[Giorgio de Chirico]], "which recalls Kafka, has to do with the sense of another world lurking, hovering like the long shadows that dominate de Chirico's paintings, which frequently depict a landscape at twilight's uncertain hour. Malaise and mystery are all by-products of the interaction of the real and the unreal, the rub and contact of two worlds caught on irrealism's shimmering surface." [http://cafeirreal.alicewhittenburg.com/review4a.htm]

The writer Dean Swinford, whose concept of irrealism was described at length in the section "Irrealism in Literature", wrote that the artist Remedios Varos, in her painting ''The Juggler'', "creates a personal allegorical system which relies on the predetermined symbols of Christian and classical iconography. But these are quickly refigured into a personal system informed by the scientific and organized like a machine...in the Irreal work, allegory operates according to an altered, but constant and orderly iconographic system."

Artist Tristan Tondino has made a number of claims about Irrealism.  Most of his claims are found in his paintings, many of which are [[Lettrist]] Abstractions. "There is no specific style to Irrealist Art.  It is the result of awareness that every human act is the result of the limitations of the world of the actor." &lt;ref&gt;Tondino 2003, ''Zot - Giving a Painter Crap...''&lt;/ref&gt;

In Australia, the art journal ''the art life'' has recently detected the presence of a "New Irrealism" among the painters of that country, which is described as being an "approach to painting that is decidedly low key, deploying its effects without histrionic showmanship, while creating an eerie other world of ghostly images and abstract washes." What exactly constituted the "old" irrealism, they do not say.

== Irrealist Art, Film and Music Edition ==

Irrealist Art Edition is a publishing company created in the 90s by contemporary plastic artist [[Frédéric Iriarte]]. Together with the Estonian poet, writer and art critic [[Ilmar Laaban]], they developed their concept of Irrealism through several essays, exhibitions, projects, manifest and a book, "Irréalisation".

[[File:Judas Returning the Thirty Silver Pieces - Rembrandt.jpg|thumb|''Judas Returning the Thirty Silver Pieces'' (Rembrandt 1629)]]
'''''Judas Repentant, Returning the Thirty Pieces of Silver''''' is a painting by [[Rembrandt]], depicting the story of [[Matthew the Apostle|Matthew]] [[s:Bible (King James)/Matthew#9:9|27:3]]: "Then [[Judas]], which had betrayed him, when he saw that he was condemned, repented himself, and brought again the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders". The painting is one of Rembrandt's earliest paintings and was made in 1629 while he was working in [[Leiden]].

About 1630 [[w:Constantijn Huygens]] wrote an analysis of the figure of Judas in Rembrandt's painting ''Judas Repentant''. Huygens argued that Rembrandt had surpassed the painters from Antiquity, as well as the great sixteenth-century Italian artists when it came to the representation of emotions expressed by figures that act in a history painting. The location of Rembrandt's painting ''Judas Repentant, Returning the Thirty Pieces of Silver'' is in [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Judas_Returning_the_Thirty_Silver_Pieces_-_Rembrandt.jpg Lythe, North Yorkshire, Mulgrave Castle]]

A '''logo''' (abbreviation of '''logotype''',&lt;ref name="Oxford Dictionaries"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/logo | title = logo: definition of logo in Oxford dictionary (British &amp; World English) | accessdate = 2014-03-05 | publisher = Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; from {{lang-el|λόγος|translit=logos|lit=word|italic=yes}} and {{lang-el|τύπος|translit=typos|lit=imprint|italic=yes|link=no}}) is a [[graphic]] mark, [[emblem]], or [[symbol]] used to aid and promote public identification and recognition. It may be of an abstract or figurative design or include the text of the name it represents as in a [[wordmark]].

In the days of [[hot metal typesetting]], a logotype was one word cast as a single piece of type (e.g. "The" in ATF [[Garamond]]), as opposed to a [[Typographic ligature|ligature]], which is two or more letters joined, but not forming a word.&lt;ref&gt;Fyffe, Charles. ''Basic Copyfitting'', Studio Vista, London, 1969, SBN 289797055, p.54.&lt;/ref&gt; By extension, the term was also used for a uniquely set and arranged [[typeface]] or [[colophon (publishing)|colophon]]. At the level of [[mass communication]] and in common usage, a company's logo is today often synonymous with its [[trademark]] or [[brand]].&lt;ref name="wheeler_dbi_pg4"&gt;Wheeler, Alina.

As the [[industrial revolution]] converted western societies from [[Agriculture|agrarian]] to industrial in the 18th and 19th centuries, photography and lithography contributed to the boom of an advertising industry that integrated [[typography]] and imagery together on the page.{{sfn|Meggs|1998|pp=138–159}} Simultaneously, typography itself was undergoing a revolution of form and expression that expanded beyond the modest, serif typefaces used in books, to bold, ornamental typefaces used on broadsheet [[poster]]s.{{sfn|Meggs|1998|pp=126–134}}

The arts were expanding in purpose—from expression and decoration of an artistic, storytelling nature, to a differentiation of brands and products that the growing middle classes were consuming. Consultancies and trades-groups in the commercial arts were growing and organizing; by 1890, the US had 700 lithographic printing firms employing more than 8,000 people.{{sfn|Meggs|1998|p=148–155}} Artistic credit tended to be assigned to the lithographic company, as opposed to the individual artists who usually performed less important jobs.
[[File:BMC 06.jpg|thumb|left|A coin from early 6th century BC [[Lydia]] bearing the head of a roaring lion with sun rays]]

Innovators in the visual arts and lithographic process—such as French printing firm Rouchon in the 1840s, Joseph Morse of New York in the 1850s, Frederick Walker of England in the 1870s, and Jules Chéret of France in the 1870s—developed an illustrative style that went beyond tonal, representational art to figurative imagery with sections of bright, flat colors.{{sfn|Meggs|1998|p=148–155}} Playful children’s books, authoritative newspapers, and conversational periodicals developed their own visual and editorial styles for unique, expanding audiences. As printing costs decreased, literacy rates increased, and visual styles changed, the [[Victorian decorative arts]] led to an expansion of typographic styles and methods of representing businesses.{{sfn|Meggs|1998|pp=159–161}}

[[File:Bass logo.svg|thumb|upright|The first logo to be trademarked was the [[Bass Brewery|Bass]] red triangle in 1876]]

The [[Arts and Crafts Movement]] of late-19th century, partially in response to the excesses of Victorian typography, aimed to restore an honest sense of craftsmanship to the mass-produced goods of the era.{{sfn|Meggs|1998|pp=162–167}} A renewal of interest in craftsmanship and quality also provided the artists and companies with a greater interest in credit, leading to the creation of unique logos and marks.

By the 1950s, [[Modernism]] had shed its roots as an avant-garde artistic movement in Europe to become an international, commercialized movement with adherents in the United States and elsewhere. The visual simplicity and conceptual clarity that were the hallmarks of [[Modernism]] as an artistic movement formed a powerful toolset for a new generation of graphic designers whose logos embodied [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]]’s dictum, "Less is more." Modernist-inspired logos proved successful in the era of mass visual communication ushered in by television, improvements in printing technology, and digital innovations.

==Contemporary logos==
[[File:Croixrouge logos.jpg|thumb|left|[[Red Cross (symbol)|Red Cross]] and [[Red Crescent (symbol)|Red Crescent]] emblems]]

The current era of logo design began in the 1870s{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} with the first abstract logo, the Bass red triangle. {{As of | 2014}}, many corporations, products, brands, services, agencies, and other entities use an ideogram (sign, icon) or an emblem (symbol) or a combination of sign and emblem as a logo. As a result, only a few of the thousands of ideograms in circulation are recognizable without a name. An effective logo may consist of both an ideogram and the company name (logotype) to emphasize the name over the graphic, and employ a unique design via the use of letters, colors, and additional graphic elements.

[[File:Cocacola cyrilic.JPG|thumb|right|upright|The Coca-Cola logo is identifiable in other writing-systems, here written in [[Cyrillic]].]]

Ideograms and symbols may be more effective than written names (logotypes), especially for logos translated into many [[alphabet]]s in increasingly globalized markets. For instance, a name written in [[Arabic script]] might have little resonance in most European markets. By contrast, ideograms  keep the general proprietary nature of a product in both markets. In non-profit areas, the [[Red Cross]] (varied as the [[Red Crescent]] in Muslim countries and as the [[Magen David Adom|Red Star of David]] in Israel) exemplifies a well-known emblem that does not need an accompanying name. The red cross and red crescent are among the best-recognized symbols in the world. National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies and their Federation as well as the International Committee of the Red Cross include these symbols in their logos.

[[Brand]]ing can aim to facilitate cross-language marketing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TICoRD'13: Global Product Development|url=https://www.springer.com/us/book/9788132210498e|website=Springer|publisher=Springers|accessdate=26 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consumers and potential consumers can identify the [[Coca-Cola]] name written in different alphabets because of the standard color and "ribbon wave" design of its logo. The text was written in [[Spencerian Script]], which was a popular writing style when the [[Coca-Cola|Coca Cola Logo]] was being designed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Coca-Cola logo story|url=http://www.coca-cola.co.uk/stories/history/advertising/the-logo-story/|website=Coca Cola Official Website|publisher=The Coca Cola Company|accessdate=28 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Logo design==

Since a logo is the visual entity signifying an organization, logo design is an important area of [[graphic design]]. A logo is the central element of a complex identification system that must be functionally extended to all communications of an organization. Therefore, the design of logos and their incorporation in a visual identity system is one of the most difficult and important areas of graphic design. Logos fall into three classifications (which can be combined). Ideographs, such as Chase Bank, are completely abstract forms; pictographs are iconic, representational designs; logotypes (or wordmarks) depict the name or company initials. Because logos are meant to represent companies' brands or corporate identities and foster their immediate customer recognition, it is counterproductive to frequently redesign logos.

The logo design profession has substantially increased in numbers over the years since the rise of the [[Modernist movement]] in the [[United States]] in the 1950s.{{sfn|Meggs|1998|p=363}} Three designers are widely{{sfn|Meggs|1998|pp=369–374}} considered the pioneers of that movement and of logo and [[corporate identity]] design: The first is [[Chermayeff &amp; Geismar]],{{sfn|Meggs|1998|pp=373–374}} which is the firm responsible for a large number of iconic logos, such as [[Chase (bank)|Chase]] Bank (1964), [[Mobil Oil]] (1965), [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] (1984), [[NBC]] (1986), [[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]] (2003), and others. Due to the simplicity and boldness of their designs, many of their earlier logos are still in use today. The firm recently designed logos for the [[Library of Congress]] and the fashion brand [[Armani Exchange]]. Another pioneer of corporate identity design is [[Paul Rand]],{{sfn|Meggs|1998|p=369}} who was one of the originators of the Swiss Style of [[graphic design]]. He designed many posters and corporate identities, including the famous logos for [[IBM]], [[United Parcel Service|UPS]], and [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]. The third pioneer of corporate identity design is [[Saul Bass]].{{sfn|Meggs|1998|p=375}} Bass was responsible for several recognizable logos in North America, including both the Bell Telephone logo (1969) and successor [[AT&amp;T Corporation]] globe (1983). Other well-known designs were [[Continental Airlines]] (1968), Dixie (1969), and [[United Way of America|United Way]] (1972). Later, he would produce logos for a number of Japanese companies as well.
An important development in the documentation of logo design is the study of French trademarks by historian Edith Amiot and philosopher Jean Louis Azizollah.&lt;ref&gt;Les Marques Francaises 1824–1974&lt;/ref&gt;

==Logo color==
Color is a key element in logo design and plays an important role in brand differentiation. The importance of color in this context is due to the mechanics of human visual perception wherein color and contrast play critical roles in visual detail detection.  In addition, we tend to acquire various color connotations and color associations through social and cultural conditioning, and these play a role in how we decipher and evaluate logo color. While color is considered important to brand recognition and logo design, it shouldn't conflict with logo functionality, and it needs to be remembered that color connotations and associations are not consistent across all social and cultural groups. For example, in the United States, red, white, and blue are often used in logos for companies that want to project patriotic feelings but other countries will have different sets of colors that evoke national pride. 

Choosing an organisation's logo's color is an important decision because of its long term implications and its role in creating differentiation among competitors' logos. A methodology for identifying potential logo colors within an industry sector is color mapping, whereby existing logo colors are systematically identified, mapped, and evaluated (O'Connor, 2011).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Zena O'Connor|title=Logo Colour and Differentiation: A New Application of Environmental Colour Mapping |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/col.20594/abstract |journal=Color Research and Application |volume=36 |number=1 |pages=55–60 |doi=10.1002/col.20594}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Logo design process===
Designing a good logo often requires involvement from a marketing team teaming with the graphic design studio. Before a logo is designed, there must be a clear definition of the concept and values of the brand as well as understanding of the consumer or target group. Broad steps in the logo design process include research, conceptualization, investigation of alternative candidates, refinement of a chosen design, testing across products, and finally adoption and production of the chosen mark.

===Dynamic logos===

}}

In 1898, the French tire manufacturer [[Michelin]] introduced the [[Michelin Man]], a cartoon figure presented in many different contexts, such as eating, drinking, and playing sports. By the early 21st century, large corporations such as [[MTV]], [[Nickelodeon]], [[Google]], [[Morton Salt]], and [[Saks Fifth Avenue]] had adopted ''dynamic logos'' that change over time from setting to setting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Internet-compatible logos===
A company that uses logotypes (wordmarks) may desire a logo that matches the firm's Internet address. For short logotypes consisting of two or three characters, multiple companies are found to employ the same letters. A "CA" logo, for example, is used by the French bank [[Credit Agricole]], the Dutch clothing retailer [[C&amp;A]], and the US software corporation [[CA Technologies]], but only one can have the Internet domain name CA.com.

In today's digital interface adaptive world, a logo will be formatted and re-formatted from large monitors to small handheld devices. With the constant size change and re-formatting, logo designers are shifting to a more bold and simple approach, with heavy lines and shapes, and solid colors. This reduces the confusion when mingled with other logos in tight spaces and when scaled between media. Social networks like [[Twitter]], [[Facebook]], [[LinkedIn]], and [[Google+]] use such logos.

==Design protection==
Logos and their design may be protected by copyright, via various [[Intellectual Property|intellectual property]] organisations worldwide which make available application procedures to register a design to give it protection at law. For example, in the UK, the [[Intellectual Property Office (United Kingdom)]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Intellectual Property Office (United Kingdom)|url=http://www.ipo.gov.uk/types/tm.htm|publisher =UK Patent Office}}&lt;/ref&gt; govern registered designs, patents, and trademarks. Ordinarily, the trademark registration will not 'make claim' to colors used, meaning it is the visual design that will be protected, even if it is reproduced in a variety of other colors or backgrounds.

==Sports==
For many teams, a logo or "[[crest (sports)|crest]]" is an important way to recognize a team's history and can intimidate opponents.
For certain teams, the logo and color scheme are synonymous with the team's players. For example, [[Manchester United]], the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]], or [[New York Yankees]] all have a recognizable logo that can be identified by any fan of the respective sport.

'''Margaret Booth''' (January 16, 1898 – October 28, 2002) was an American [[film editor]].

==Life and career==
Born in Los Angeles, she started her Hollywood career as a 'patcher', editing films by [[David Wark Griffith|D. W. Griffith]], around 1915. Her brother was actor [[Elmer Booth]]. Later she worked for [[Louis B. Mayer]] when he was an independent film producer. When Mayer merged with others to form [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] in 1924, she worked as a director's assistant with that company. She edited several films starring [[Greta Garbo]], including ''[[Camille (1936 film)|Camille]]'' (1936).

Booth edited such diverse films as ''[[Wise Girls (1929 film)|Wise Girls]]'' (1929), ''[[Mutiny on the Bounty (1935 film)|Mutiny on the Bounty]]'' (1935, for which she was nominated for an [[Academy Award for Film Editing|Academy Award]]), ''[[A Yank at Oxford]]'' (1938), ''[[The Way We Were]]'' (1973), ''[[The Sunshine Boys (1975 film)|The Sunshine Boys]]'' (1975), ''[[The Goodbye Girl]]'' (1977), ''[[The Cheap Detective]]'' (1978), and ''[[Seems Like Old Times (film)|Seems Like Old Times]]'' (1980). She was supervising editor and associate producer on several films for producer [[Ray Stark]], culminating with executive producer credit on ''[[The Slugger's Wife]]'' (1985) when she was 87 years old.

However, her list of official credits represents just a fraction of Booth's film work.  In her role as MGM's Supervising Film Editor from 1939 to 1968, the [[Village Voice]] described her as "the final authority of every picture the studio made for 30 years."&lt;ref&gt;Village Voice, "His Girl Friday" by Terrence Rafferty, Nov 30, 1982, pg. 83&lt;/ref&gt;  Upon her death, [[the Guardian]] wrote, "All the filmmakers had to go through her in order to have a final editing of sound and vision approved," while describing her approach:

{{quote|She was a pioneer of the classic editing style, the so-called "invisible cutting", the aim of which was to make the transition from one image to another as seamless as possible, so the audience was almost unaware of the flow of shots within a sequence. Narrative was dominant, maintaining a continuity of time and space, and matching cuts to action.&lt;ref&gt;The Guardian, Margaret Booth obituary, Nov 15 2002&lt;/ref&gt;}}

She received an [[Academy Honorary Award]] from the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] in 1978 for her work in film editing. She is the second longest-lived person (after [[Luise Rainer]]) to have been given an Oscar. In 1983, she was awarded the [[Women in Film Los Angeles|Women in Film]] [[Women in Film Crystal + Lucy Awards#THE CRYSTAL AWARD|Crystal Award]] for outstanding women who, through their endurance and the excellence of their work, have helped to expand the role of women within the entertainment industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wif.org/past-recipients |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-05-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/614ten37o?url=http://wif.org/past-recipients |archivedate=August 20, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990, Booth was honored with the [[American Cinema Editors Career Achievement Award]].  She died in 2002, aged 104, from complications of a stroke she suffered. She is interred at Inglewood Park Cemetery, Inglewood California.

'''Margarita Perveņecka''' (born 16 January 1976 in [[Riga]]) is a [[Latvia|Latvian]] playwright and prose writer. Her works have been performed in numerous Latvian theatres, and are noted for displaying an unusual view of the world, poetic expression, foreign words, science terms and neologisms, creating an alienated society. She received the Literatūras gada balva (Literature award) in 2011 for her novel, "Gaetano Krematoss".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.diena.lv/kd/literatura/literaturas-gada-balva/pasniegtas-latvijas-literaturas-gada-balvas-13944060|title=Pasniegtas Latvijas Literatūras gada balvas|publisher=Diena.lv|accessdate=8 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[theatre]], the '''master electrician''' (or '''chief electrician''' in the UK) is responsible for implementing the lighting design for a production drawn up by the [[lighting designer]]. This involves overseeing the preparation, hanging, connection and focusing of [[stage lighting]] fixtures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Parker | first = W. Oren | title = Scene Design and Stage Lighting | isbn = 0-03-028777-4 | publisher = [[Holt, Rinehart and Winston]] | date = 1990 | page = 263 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This can be done on a show-by-show basis, or as a resident position of a specific theatre. The tool of the trade of the theatrical master electrician is the [[adjustable spanner]] or crescent wrench, used to secure [[stage lighting instrument]]s from lighting positions in the theatre. This wrench is typically attached to the belt or wrist with a [[lanyard]], which is important because the master electrician tends to work at great height, from [[ladder]]s, [[lift table]]s, [[catwalk (theater)|catwalks]], or lighting [[trusses]], where a falling wrench may hurt people or damage property below.

== Duties ==
The master electrician supervises and is responsible for all other electricians working on any construction or installation project. Only the master electrician can pull the permits with the electrical authority, and they can only be registered with one electrical contracting company at any one time.
Other electrical duties performed by any electrician include:
* [[Inventory]] and [[repair and maintenance]] of all lighting fixtures, cables, effects, power distribution, [[dimmer]]s, networking and [[lighting control console]]s.
* Organization and purchasing of all consumables including [[color gel]], [[Gobo (lighting)|gobos]], [[Sharpie (marker)|Sharpies]], and [[gaffer tape]].
* Planning and implementing of the cabling (''circuiting'') of lights and [[electric power]] distribution.
* Documenting and tracking of all circuiting, addressing, and system configuration in cooperation with the Lighting Designer.
* Patching assignments of the control console based on the paperwork generated by the lighting designer and the planned circuiting.
* [[Occupational safety and health]] of workers and operational decisions as the head of the electrics department.

== Training, origin, and professional affiliations ==
Master electricians go through extensive on-site and classroom training, with work in more formal settings such as schools or colleges. The designation "master" is only given to electricians who can display extensive job knowledge and are tested to have an extensive understanding of the electrical safety code.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}

There are no formal certifications of the "theatrical title, master electrician", as there are in some of the more mainstream trades, but in March 2003&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://etcp.plasa.org/faq/faq.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-06-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150611020942/http://etcp.plasa.org/faq/faq.html |archivedate=2015-06-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Entertainment Services and Technology Association|ESTA]], which merged with PLASA in 2010,&lt;ref&gt;http://sightlines.usitt.org/archive/v50/n07/stories/EstaPlasa.html&lt;/ref&gt; developed a certification process. Those who pass this rigorous test will become ETCP Certified Entertainment Electricians - and will be recognized as the industry's best.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://etcp.plasa.org/candidateinfo/electricalexam.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-06-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150901060252/http://etcp.plasa.org/candidateinfo/electricalexam.html |archivedate=2015-09-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[stagehands]] union, [[International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees|IATSE]], come close in that they offer [[apprentice]] and [[journeyman]] levels of certification. In the future, IATSE, or some of the larger local affiliations may form a more formal method of certification, which may include the title of master electrician. In the meantime, almost every production, from high school shows to [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] uses the term to describe their primary electrician, regardless of their skill level or experience.

'''Mediology''' (French: ''médiologie''), broadly indicates a wide-ranging method for the analysis of [[cultural transmission]] in society and across societies, a method which challenges the conventional idea that 'technology is not culture'. The mediological method pays specific attention to the role of organisations and technical innovations, and the ways in which these can ensure the potency of cultural transmission - and thus the transformation of ideas into a civilisational worldview capable of sustained action.

==Overview==
The term was first coined and introduced in French as "médiologie" by the French intellectual [[Régis Debray]] in the "Teachers, Writers, Celebrities" section of his book ''Le pouvoir intellectuel en France'', (Editions Ramsay, 1979). The English form of the term became more widely known and respected in the English-speaking world with the publication of the key text on mediology in English, Debray's ''Transmitting Culture'' (University of Columbia Press, 2004). Mediology was taught for the first time in the Sorbonne (Paris) in 2007.

The practice of mediology is not a science, and thus is able to range across academic disciplines. The main areas involved are those of longitudinal history (the history of technologies, the history of the book, the histories and theories of aesthetics) and also research in communications and information theory.

Mediology is not a narrow specialist area of contemporary academic knowledge (as [[media sociology]] is), nor does it aspire to be a precise science of signs (as [[semiotics]] does). It differs from the models put forward by [[communication studies]], in that its focus is not isolated individuals and a fleeting few moments of communication. Instead mediologists study the cultural transmission of [[religion]]s, ideologies, the arts and political ideas in society, and across societies, over a time period that is usually to be measured in months, decades or millennia. Debray argues that mediology "would like to bring to light the function of [[Media (communication)|medium]] in all its forms, over a long time span - since the birth of writing. And without becoming obsessed by today's media."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monde-diplomatique.fr/1999/08/DEBRAY/12314|title=Qu'est-ce que la médiologie ?, par Régis Debray (Le Monde diplomatique, août 1999)|publisher=Monde-diplomatique.fr|accessdate=13 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mediology must thus closely examine the methods used for the memorising, transmission, and displacement of cultural knowledge in any [[milieu]]. But it must balance its understanding of these with an equally close study of our individual modes of belief, thoughts, and competing social organisations. Mediology must further understand that such transmission is not simply happening within a lofty [[linguistic]] or textual discourse, but that transmission takes an equally valid concrete form in which "material technologies and symbolic forms"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monde-diplomatique.fr/1999/08/DEBRAY/12314|title=Qu'est-ce que la médiologie ?, par Régis Debray (Le Monde diplomatique, août 1999)|publisher=Monde-diplomatique.fr|accessdate=13 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; combine to produce things such as [[rituals]], [[architecture]], [[flags]], special sites, customs, [[typefaces]] and [[book binding]]s, smells and sounds, [[body language|bodily gestures and postures]], all of which have a potent anchoring role in cultural transmission among ordinary people.

Debray further points to the need to consider the role in transmission of all manner of non-media technical-cultural inventions, especially those of new forms of transportation. He gives the historical example of the [[bicycle]], which he suggests was historically associated with: the rise of a democratic rational individualism; a new role for women in advanced societies; and the new kinetic ideas expressed in early [[modernist]] art and cinema.

A mediologist might thus make an examination "within a system" (e.g. of systems of book production, of authors and publishers), or of "the interaction between systems" (e.g. how [[painting]] and [[early photography]] influenced each other), or even of "the interactions across systems" (e.g. the ways in which symbolic transmission of systematic knowledge is brought to intersect with the material history of actual transportation - such as desert trading routes and ancient religion, [[telegraph]] and railroad, the radio and airplanes, television and satellites, mobile phones and cars).

Debray is generally critical of some of the ideas of [[Marshall McLuhan]] (whom he sees as being overly [[Technological determinism|technologically determinist]]), and of the French [[sociologist]] [[Pierre Bourdieu]]. He also tries to step beyond [[Antonio Gramsci]], in that he suggests that an ideology cannot be comprehended in ideological terms alone.

==Criticisms==
Criticisms of mediology in English so far have been found in two short book reviews and one article.  The first, by the screenwriter [[Yvette Biro|Yvette Bíró]] (''Wide Angle'' magazine, Vol.18, No.1, January 1996), was a four-page book review of Debray's ''Vie et Mort de l'Image'', in which she claimed to have discerned "traces of a strong, vulgar [[Marxist]] school of thought".

The second review, by [[Pramod Nayor]] of the University of Hyderabad (''Journal for Cultural and Religious Theory'', Vol.8, No.1, Winter 2006) was a review of the English translation of ''Transmitting Culture'' (2004).  In concluding the review Nayor notes the similarities of some aspects and directions of mediology to [[Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies|Birmingham School cultural studies]] ranging from "[[Raymond Williams]] through [[Stuart Hall (cultural theorist)|Stuart Hall]]". Nayor also notes that recent philosophers and historians of science - he cites [[Bruno Latour]], [[Eugene Thacker]] and [[Dwight Atkinson]] - have also examined science in relation to "intersecting cultural, ethnic, economic and iconographic 'bases' of the transmission of culture"

An article by Steven Maris in ''Fibreculture'' No.12 [http://journal.fibreculture.org/issue12/issue12_maras.html] similarly suggests that Debray is too firmly embedded in "the French academic scene" and that thus "Debray's explicit engagement with other national scholarly traditions of media, communications and cultural studies in the works mentioned above is minimal". Maris also notes that mediology "predates much of the [current academic] interest in networked cultures and new media".

Physicists [[Alan Sokal]] and [[Jean Bricmont]] have criticized Debray's work for using [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems|Gödel's theorem]] as a metaphor without understanding its basic ideas, in their book ''[[Fashionable Nonsense]]''. Debray engaged in dialogue with Bricmont in a 2003 book titled "À l'ombre des lumières : Débat entre un philosophe et un scientifique", which so far has not been translated into English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alencon.fr/alencon/Main;jsessionid=DCNAOEIEBKEB?ISUM_ID=center&amp;ISUM_SCR=nwExternalServiceScr&amp;ISUM_CIPH=T9aJnOHAgwQV8T2hIQ5D3Du3v4I5zbXVbG3CxvkJy7s_&amp;ISUM_URL=rtE--JVQ7nRU10QjZURxmHAxjLLIW3DXPzmc29-XDq1dc8FTO2YT0563J3xcF8aK |accessdate=August 19, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090816160928/http://www.alencon.fr/alencon/Main |archivedate=August 16, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite such criticisms, the six-volume ''New Dictionary of the History of Ideas'' (2004) wrote of Debray that "His achievement is to have synthesized these earlier arguments into a practice with a powerful political project ahead of it." (Vol.4, page 1394).

'''Micrography''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]], literally small-writing – "Μικρογραφία"), also called '''microcalligraphy''', is a [[Jew]]ish form of [[calligram]]s developed in the 9th century, with parallels in Christianity and Islam,&lt;ref&gt;[http://expositions.bnf.fr/parole/grand/134.htm Torah, Bible, Coran] (French)&lt;/ref&gt; utilizing minute [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew letters]] to form representational, geometric and abstract designs. Colored micrography is especially distinctive because these rare artworks are customarily rendered in black and white.

== Description ==
The artwork is created from text that forms an image when viewed at a distance, creating an interplay between the text and image. The [[photomosaic]], whose tiny individual images form a mosaic when viewed from a distance, is a modern analogue.

== Motivation ==
{{see also|Calligram}}
[[File:Caligrafia arabe pajaro.jpg|thumb|An Arabic [[calligram]] in the form of a peacock.]]
There is a relationship between this form of art, employing both digital and analogic symbols, and the restrictions on images found in the [[Ten commandments#Traditional division and interpretation|second commandment]]. Micrography provides a unique solution to the visual artist who wishes to remain devout in observation of [[Jewish law]], by using only text, not images per se. As similar restrictions exist in certain [[Islam|Muslim]] societies, this solution has been adapted in [[Islamic calligraphy]] to the [[Arabic alphabet]] as well.

The '''Ministry of Tourism and Arts''' is a [[Ministry (government department)|ministry]] in [[Zambia]]. It is headed by the Minister of Tourism and Arts.

In 2002 the Ministry of Tourism was merged with the [[Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources (Zambia)|Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources]] to form the Ministry of Tourism, Environment and Natural Resources.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biodiv.be/zambia/implementation/competent-institutions-and-national-authorities/mtenr Ministry of Tourism, Environment and Natural Resources - MTENR] Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD)&lt;/ref&gt; However, Tourism was later merged into the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Zambia)|Foreign Affairs ministry]]. In 2011 Tourism was split out from the Foreign ministry and merged with the Art portfolio to form the Ministry of Tourism and Arts.&lt;ref name=MOTA&gt;[http://www.mota.gov.zm/index.php/features About The Ministry] Ministry of Tourism an Arts&lt;/ref&gt;

The ministry oversees several statutory bodies, including the Hotels Board of Management, the Hotels Managers Registration Council, the [[National Arts Council of Zambia|National Arts Council]], the National Heritage Conservation Commission, the National Museum Board, the Zambia Institute for Tourism and Hospitality Studies and the Zambia Tourism Agency.&lt;ref name=MOTA/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9630">'''Ofakim Hadashim''' ("New Horizons") is an art movement started in [[Tel Aviv]] in 1942.

==New Horizons==

[[File:Zaritsky, Yossef, Painting, 1950-1~B74 0036.jpg|right|200px|thumb|[[Joseph Zaritsky]]&lt;br&gt;Naan, The Painter and the Model, 1949&lt;br&gt;[[Israel Museum]], Jerusalem]]

[[File:Feigin ein harod.JPG||right|200px|thumb|[[Dov Feigin]]&lt;br&gt;Growth, 1959&lt;br&gt;Ein Harod Mueeum of Art]]
The Ofakim Hadashim art movement began with a group of artists who mounted an exhibition in Tel Aviv's Habima national theater in December 1942, under the name "The Group of Eight". The group evolved into a coherent artistic movement only after the founding of the state of Israel in 1948. Members of the school included [[Arie Aroch]], [[Zvi Meirowitch]], [[Avraham Naton]] (Natanson), [[Avigdor Stematsky]] and [[Yehezkel Streichman]]. The work of sculptor [[Dov Feigin]] also appeared in the catalog of the 1942 exhibition, though it was not displayed. In February 1947 five of the original members of the group joined [[Joseph Zaritsky]] for an exhibit called "The Group of Seven" at the [[Tel Aviv Museum of Art]].&lt;ref&gt;Gila Blass, New Horizons (Reshefim Publishers, Tel Aviv, 1980), pp. 16-17 (in Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt; Members of the group stated that "The group is based in modernism, especially French, yet seeks a unique style that expresses our own reality".&lt;ref&gt;Davar Ha-Shavua, 12 February 1947.&lt;/ref&gt;

For these artists, this was not only a statement of philosophy, but a practical work plan. Zaritsky, who served as chairman of the League of Painters and Sculptors in the Land of Israel, opposed the league's philosophy of equality among artists. In 1948, at the time of the opening of the artists' house that was to become the League's permanent home, he was delegated to select works for the Bienniale in Venice. His selections caused such an outrage among the members that he was ousted from his position. He walked out with a group of artists, and founded an alternative movement, the "New Horizons". On 9 November 1948, the Tel Aviv Museum of Art opened the first exhibit bearing the movement's name. Among the artists showing were Pinchas Abramovich, [[Marcel Janco]], [[Aharon Kahana]], [[Yohanan Simon]], [[Avshalom Okashi]] and [[Moshe Castel]], as well as movement founders Zaritsky, Streichman and Feigin.

The group sought a style that reflected the striving for Zionism and Modernism. This style was largely dictated by the leading artists of the group - Zaritsky, Stematsky Mairovich and Streichman. In practice, this style was a variant of European modernism. The style has been called "lyrical abstract", but in fact, there was little purely abstract art, but rather works rooted in the local visual landscape. This essentially figurative style was pushed toward the abstract by bold brush strokes, and a strong use of bright colors typical of the "Land of Israel" style, reflecting the strong Mediterranean light. Formats were generally rather small, and the style was similar to European abstract art before the second World War, akin to the art of Wassily Kandinsky, and unlike the abstract art prevalent in the United States at the time.

For example, in his series "Yehiam" (1949–1952), Zaritsky depicts scenes from the establishment of Kibbutz Yehiam in northern Israel. The early paintings in this series (mostly watercolors) depict the natural landscapes of the region, while the later paintings are (mostly oil) abstractions of these earlier scenes. This progression, contends art critic and curator Mordecai Omer, reflects Zaritsky's belief that external visual reality is the basis of artistic originality.&lt;ref&gt;Mordechai Omer, Zaritzky (Tel Aviv Museum, Tel Aviv, 1984), p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt;

Zvi Meirovich, a prominent members of Okakim Hadashim he painted in the abstract lyric style but unlike his colleagues Mairovich was more inclined to a German rather than a French pallette. Hs bold use of black and reds particularly in the gouaches. The big breakthrough was in oil pastels, that only he made in large format. Using a deep space photo surface rather than a flat paper was pioneering moment.

Others in the group, however, deviated from this style. Marcel Janco, of international fame for his involvement in the Dada movement in Europe in the 1930s, did not adopt this approach to abstraction; rather his art uses European Cubist and Expressionist styles to create a Jewish-Zionist narrative. Moshe Castel, also, went through a transformation during the 1950s from abstraction to expressionism characteristic of the Canaanist movement.

In the field of sculpture, the group introduced new media. [[Yechiel Shemi]], Dov Feigin, and, after a sojourn in Britain, [[Itzhak Danziger]], introduced welded steel as a new medium. This new form freed these artists from the figurative character of stone and wood carving, for a more purely abstract oeuvre. Here, too, however, there is frequent reference to the Canaanite figurativeness and symbolism.

Indeed, during the 1950s, the "New Horizons" group tended more and more toward the abstract, and away from reliance on the figurative. Zaritsky led this shift, which was rooted in what he saw as a guiding ideology. Some members of the group, however, rejected this ideology, and eventually quit the movement. These included Janco, Aharon Kahana and Yehiel Simon.&lt;ref&gt;See: Gila Blass, New Horizons, pp. 64-66.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Realism and Social art==

While the abstract and secular works of the New Horizons group had profound influence on the course of art in Israel, they were nonetheless considered at the time to be on the fringes of mainstream art, which was mostly figurative and often bearing explicit Jewish and Zionist messages. This explicitly nationalist trend in Israeli art was denounced by its opponents as "regionalism".&lt;ref&gt;Yona Fischer, Tamar Manor-Friedman, The Birth of Now: The 1960s in Israeli Art (Ashdod Museum of Art, 2008), p. 10 (In Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt; New Horizon critics, who maintained that art was international and universal, were opposed by the ideology of the Bezalel School at the time. [[Mordechai Ardon]], head of Bezalel, wrote in 1954, "Every artist, like every citizen, must serve his country in heart and in soul".&lt;ref&gt;Cited in: Galia Bar-Or, Gideon Efrat, The First Decade: Hegemony and Multiciplicity (Museum of Art Ein Harod, 2008), p. 21 (In Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt; 

New Horizons artists, too, despite their avowed adherence to a philosophy of universality, often expressed in their works sentiments of nationalism, Zionism, and socialism. For example, Zaritsky, one of the leading ideologues of the universalist school, produced series of paintings focusing on Israeli kibbutzim - his series "Yehiam", and a similar series on Naan (a kibbutz in central Israel), 1950–1952. Both these series include abstractions of the Israeli landscape. Zvi Meirovich one of the founders of New Horizons produced a series of large oil paintings called Mizpe Ramon focusing on the Israeli deseret. Sculptor Dov Feigin produced "Wheat Sheaves" in 1956, and Dadaist Janco painted "Soldiers", "Air raid Alarms" and "Maabarot" (jerry-built communities housing new Jewish immigrants in the 1950s). Some of the New Horizons artists belonged to the "Center for Advanced Culture" run by the Socialist-Zionist youth movement "[[Hashomer Hatzair]]".&lt;ref&gt;See: Gila Blass, New Horizons, p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; This activity culminated in the founding of the artists' village Ein Harod by a group of artists headed by Janco. There, Janco hoped to found a new socialist and artistic utopia.

Mordechai Ardon's work stands out from that of other New Horizons artists for dealing with the mystical and historical, rather than concentrating on the present. His canvases often depict episodes from Jewish history, from Biblical scenes to the Holocaust. In 1965 [[Raffi Lavie]] founded a group called "[[10+]]", which sought an alternative to the "lyric abstraction" of the New Horizons group.

The '''Palais Garnier''' ({{IPA-fr|palɛ ɡaʁnje|pron}} French {{Audio-IPA|Palais Garnier Pronunciation.ogg|}}) is a 1,979-seat [[opera house]], which was built from 1861 to 1875 for the [[Paris Opera]]. It was called the Salle des Capucines, because of its location on the [[Boulevard des Capucines]] in the [[9th arrondissement of Paris]], but soon became known as the Palais Garnier, in recognition of its opulence and its architect, [[Charles Garnier (architect)|Charles Garnier]]. The theatre is also often referred to as the '''Opéra Garnier''' ({{IPA-fr|ɔpeʁa ɡaʁnje|pron}} French {{Audio-IPA|L'opera de Garnier.ogg|}}) and historically was known as the Opéra de Paris or simply the Opéra,&lt;ref&gt;Beauvert 1996, pp. 102–109 (capacity, theatre names); Hanser 2006, pp. 172 (dates of construction).&lt;/ref&gt; as it was the primary home of the Paris Opera and its associated [[Paris Opera Ballet]] until 1989, when the [[Opéra Bastille]] opened at the [[Place de la Bastille]].&lt;ref&gt;Ayers 2004, p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt; The Paris Opera now mainly uses the Palais Garnier for ballet.

The Palais Garnier has been called "probably the most famous opera house in the world, a symbol of Paris like [[Notre Dame de Paris|Notre Dame Cathedral]], the [[Louvre Palace|Louvre]], or the [[Sacré-Cœur, Paris|Sacré Coeur Basilica]]."&lt;ref name=Hanser&gt;Hanser 2006, pp. 172–179.&lt;/ref&gt; This is at least partly due to its use as the setting for [[Gaston Leroux]]'s 1910 novel ''[[The Phantom of the Opera]]'' and, especially, the novel's subsequent adaptations in films and the popular [[The Phantom of the Opera (1986 musical)|1986 musical]].&lt;ref name=Hanser/&gt; Another contributing factor is that among the buildings constructed in Paris during the [[Second French Empire|Second Empire]], besides being the most expensive,&lt;ref name=Simeone177&gt;Simeone 2000, p. 177.&lt;/ref&gt; it has been described as the only one that is "unquestionably a masterpiece of the first rank."&lt;ref name=Watkin&gt;Watkin 1996, pp. 391–392.&lt;/ref&gt;
This opinion is far from unanimous however: the 20th-century French architect [[Le Corbusier]] once described it as "a lying art" and contended that the "Garnier movement is a décor of the grave".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted and translated in Woolf 1988, pp. 220, 233. From Le Corbusier, ''Almanach d'Architecture Moderne, Collection de 'L'Esprit Nouveau'', [[Charles Eliot Norton Lectures]] 1938–9 (Paris, 1955), p. 120 ("art de mensonge", "événement Garnier est un décor d'enterrement").&lt;/ref&gt;

The Palais Garnier also houses the [[Bibliothèque-Musée de l'Opéra de Paris]] (Paris Opera Library-Museum), although the Library-Museum is no longer managed by the Opera and is part of the [[Bibliothèque-Musée de l'Opéra National de Paris|Bibliothèque Nationale de France]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bnf.fr/fr/collections_et_services/dpts/s.bibliotheque-musee_opera.html?first_Art=non "Bibliothèque-Musée de l'Opéra"] (in French) at the BnF website. Retrieved 3 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The museum is included in unaccompanied tours of the Palais Garnier.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.operadeparis.fr/cns11/live/onp/L_Opera/Palais_Garnier/PalaisGarnier.php?lang=en "Palais Garnier"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111018070322/http://www.operadeparis.fr/cns11/live/onp/L_Opera/Palais_Garnier/PalaisGarnier.php?lang=en |date=18 October 2011 }} at the Paris Opera website. Retrieved 3 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architecture and style==
The opera was constructed in what Garnier himself is said to have told the [[Empress Eugenie]] was  "Napoleon III"&lt;ref&gt;Sarmant, Thierry, ''Histoire de Paris: Politique, Urbanisme, civilization'', (2012), pg. 191&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Napoleon III style]] was highly eclectic, and borrowed from many historical sources;  the opera house included elements from the [[Baroque]], the classicism of [[Palladio]], and [[Renaissance architecture]], artfully blended together.&lt;ref&gt;Ducher, Robert, ''Caractéristique des Styles'' (1988), page 190&lt;/ref&gt;  These were combined with axial symmetry and modern techniques and materials, including the use of an iron framework, which had been pioneered in other Napoleon III buildings, including the [[Bibliotheque Nationale]] and the markets of [[Les Halles]].&lt;ref name="Texier, Simon 2012 page 95"&gt;Texier, Simon, ''Paris- Panorama de l'archirecture'' (2012) page 95&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mead 1991, pp. 4–5; {{cite web|last1=Sveiven|first1=Megan|title=AD Classics: Paris Opera / Charles Garnier|url=http://www.archdaily.com/105785/ad-classics-paris-opera-charles-garnier/|website=ArchDaily|accessdate=19 March 2015}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The facade and the interior followed the Napoleon III style principle of leaving no space without decoration.&lt;ref name="Texier, Simon 2012 page 95"/&gt;  Garnier used polychromy, or a variety of colors, for theatrical effect, achieved different varieties of marble and stone, [[porphyry (geology)|porphyry]], and gilded bronze.  The facade of the Opera used seventeen different kinds of material, arranged in very elaborate multicolored marble friezes, columns, and lavish statuary, many of which portray deities of [[Greek mythology]].&lt;ref name="Texier, Simon 2012 page 95"/&gt; 
[[File:Palais Garnier plan d'ensemble - Nuitter 1875 p196 - Google Books.jpg|thumb|left|[[:File:Palais Garnier plan d'ensemble - Nuitter 1875 p196 - Google Books.jpg|Plan of the Palais Garnier]]]]

===Exterior===
====Main facade====
[[Image:Palais Garnier Statue.JPG|thumb|right|upright=1.15|[[Charles Gumery|Gumery]]'s ''L'Harmonie'' (1869), atop the left [[avant-corps]] of the façade, is 7.5 metres (25 ft) of gilt copper electrotype]]

The principal facade is on the south side of the building, overlooking the [[Place de l'Opéra]] and terminates the perspective along the [[Avenue de l'Opéra]]. Fourteen painters, mosaicists and seventy-three sculptors participated in the creation of its ornamentation.

The two gilded figural groups, [[Charles Gumery]]'s ''L'Harmonie'' (Harmony) and ''La Poésie'' (Poetry), crown the apexes of the principal facade's left and right [[avant-corps]]. They are both made of gilt copper electrotype.

The bases of the two avant-corps are decorated (from left to right) with four major multi-figure groups sculpted by [[François Jouffroy]] (''Poetry'', also known as ''Harmony''),&lt;ref&gt;Jouffroy's group is titled ''l'Harmonie'' in Nuitter 1878, [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k5708010j/f35.image.r=.langEN p. 11], and in Garnier 1875–81, [https://books.google.com/books?id=FJZZAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA424 vol. 1, p. 424], [https://books.google.com/books?id=SZZZAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA273 vol. 2, p. 273], but is identified as ''La Poésie'' in the "Table des planches" of the 1875 atlas folio ''Statues décoratives'' ([[:File:Durandelle Opera Statues decoratives 002.jpg|View at Wikimedia Commons]]), and according to Fontaine 2000, p. 82, is also sometimes referred to as ''Lyric Poetry''.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jean-Baptiste Claude Eugène Guillaume]] (''Instrumental Music''), [[Jean-Baptiste Carpeaux]] (''[[La Danse (Carpeaux)|The Dance]]'', criticised for indecency), and [[Jean-Joseph Perraud]] (''Lyrical Drama''). The facade also incorporates other work by Gumery, [[Alexandre Falguière]], and others.&lt;ref name=Fontaine2000/&gt;

Gilded [[galvanoplastic]] bronze busts of many of the great composers are located between the columns of the theatre's front façade and depict, from left to right, [[Gioachino Rossini|Rossini]], [[Daniel Auber|Auber]], [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]], [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]], [[Gaspare Spontini|Spontini]], [[Giacomo Meyerbeer|Meyerbeer]], and [[Fromental Halévy|Halévy]]. On the left and right lateral returns of the front facade are busts of the librettists [[Eugène Scribe]] and [[Philippe Quinault]], respectively.&lt;ref name=Fontaine2000&gt;Fontaine 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

====Stage flytower====
The sculptural group ''Apollo, Poetry, and Music'', located at the apex of the south gable of the stage [[fly system|flytower]], is the work of [[Aimé Millet]], and the two smaller bronze [[Pegasus]] figures at either end of the south gable are by [[Eugène-Louis Lequesne]].

[[File:Opéra Garnier facade with sculpture labels.jpg|thumb|upright=3|centre|Facade of the Palais Garnier with labels indicating the locations of various sculptures]]

====Pavillon de l'Empereur====
Also known as the Rotonde de l'Empereur, this group of rooms is located on the left (west) side of the building and was designed to allow secure and direct access by the Emperor via a double ramp to the building. When the Empire fell, work stopped, leaving unfinished dressed stonework. It now houses the [[Bibliothèque-Musée de l'Opéra de Paris]] (Paris Opera Library-Museum) which is home to nearly 600,000 documents including 100,000 books, 1,680 periodicals, 10,000 programs, letters, 100,000 photographs, sketches of costumes and sets, posters and historical administrative records.

====Pavillon des Abonnés====
Located on the right (east) side of the building as a counterpart to the Pavillon de l'Empereur, this pavilion was designed to allow subscribers (''abonnés'') direct access from their carriages to the interior of the building.  It is covered by a 13.5-metre diameter dome. Paired obelisks mark the entrances to the rotunda on the north and the south.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Interior===
The interior consists of interweaving corridors, stairwells, alcoves and landings, allowing the movement of large numbers of people and space for socialising during intermission. Rich with velvet, gold leaf, and cherubim and nymphs, the interior is characteristic of Baroque sumptuousness.

====Grand staircase====

The building features a large ceremonial staircase of white marble with a balustrade of red and green marble, which divides into two divergent flights of stairs that lead to the Grand Foyer. Its design was inspired by [[Victor Louis]]'s grand staircase for the [[Théâtre de Bordeaux]]. The pedestals of the staircase are decorated with female torchères, created by [[Albert-Ernest Carrier-Belleuse]].  The ceiling above the staircase was painted by [[Isidore Pils]] to depict ''The Triumph of Apollo'', ''The Enchantment of Music Deploying its Charms'', ''Minerva Fighting Brutality Watched by the Gods of Olympus'', and ''The City of Paris Receiving the Plan of the New Opéra''. When the paintings were first fixed in place two months before the opening of the building, it was obvious to Garnier that they were too dark for the space. With the help of two of his students, Pils had to rework the canvases while they were in place overhead on the ceiling and, at the age of 61, he fell ill. His students had to finish the work, which was completed the day before the opening and the scaffolding was removed.&lt;ref&gt;Kirkland 2013, pp. 283—284.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

====Grand foyer====
This hall, 18 meters high, 154 meters long and 13 meters wide, was designed to act as a drawing room for Paris society. It was restored in 2004. Its ceiling was painted by [[Paul-Jacques-Aimé Baudry]] and represents various moments in the history of music. The foyer opens onto an outside loggia and is flanked by two octagonal salons with ceilings painted by [[Jules-Élie Delaunay]] in the eastern salon and [[Félix-Joseph Barrias]] in the western salon. The octagonal salons open to the north into the Salon de la Lune at the western end of the Avant-Foyer and the Salon du Soleil at its eastern end.&lt;ref name=Fontaine2004p152&gt;Fontaine 2004, p. 152.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

====Auditorium====
The auditorium has a traditional Italian horseshoe shape and can seat 1,979. The stage is the largest in Europe and can accommodate as many as 450 artists. The canvas house curtain was painted to represent a draped curtain, complete with tassels and braid.

The ceiling area which surrounds the chandelier was originally painted by [[Jules Eugène Lenepveu]].
In 1964 a new ceiling painted by [[Marc Chagall]] was installed on a removable frame over the original. It depicts scenes from operas by 14 composers – [[Modest Mussorgsky|Mussorgsky]], Mozart, [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]], [[Hector Berlioz|Berlioz]], [[Jean-Philippe Rameau|Rameau]], [[Claude Debussy|Debussy]], [[Maurice Ravel|Ravel]], [[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky]], [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]], [[Adolphe Adam|Adam]], [[Georges Bizet|Bizet]], [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]], [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]], and [[Christoph Willibald Gluck|Gluck]]. Although praised by some, others feel Chagall's work creates "a false note in Garnier's carefully orchestrated interior."&lt;ref&gt;Hanser 2006, p. 177.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Palais Garnier auditorium chandelier - Nuitter 1875 p147.jpg|thumb|left|&lt;center&gt;Auditorium chandelier&lt;/center&gt;]]

The seven-ton bronze and crystal chandelier was designed by Garnier. Jules Corboz prepared the model, and it was cast and chased by Lacarière, Delatour &amp; Cie. The total cost came to 30,000 gold [[French franc|francs]]. The use of a central chandelier aroused controversy, and it was criticised for obstructing views of the stage by patrons in the fourth level boxes and views of the ceiling painted by Eugène Lenepveu.&lt;ref name=FontaineChandelier&gt;Fontaine 2004, p. 94–95.&lt;/ref&gt; Garnier had anticipated these disadvantages but provided a lively defence in his 1871 book ''Le Théâtre'': "What else could fill the theatre with such joyous life? Who else could offer the variety of forms that we have in the pattern of the flames, in these groups and tiers of points of light, these wild hues of gold flecked with bright spots, and these crystalline highlights?"&lt;ref&gt;Garnier 1871, [https://books.google.com/books?id=l8wjAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA205 p. 205]; quoted and translated in Fontaine 2004, p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 May 1896, one of the chandelier's [[counterweight]]s broke free and burst through the ceiling into the auditorium, killing a concierge. This incident inspired one of the more famous scenes in [[Gaston Leroux]]'s classic 1910 [[gothic novel]] ''[[The Phantom of the Opera]]''.&lt;ref name=FontaineChandelier/&gt;

Originally the chandelier was raised up through the ceiling into the cupola over the auditorium for cleaning, but now it is lowered. The space in the cupola was used in the 1960s for opera rehearsals, and in the 1980s was remodelled into two floors of dance rehearsal space. The lower floor consists of the Salle Nureïev ([[Nureyev]]) and the Salle [[Balanchine]], and the upper floor, the Salle [[Marius Petipa|Petipa]].&lt;ref name=FontaineChandelier/&gt;

=====Organ=====
[[Image:MezzanineOpera2.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|right|[[L'Opéra Restaurant]] opened in 2011]]

The grand organ was built by Aristide Cavaillé-Coll for use during lyrical works. It has been out of service for several decades.

====Restaurant====
{{Main|L'Opéra restaurant}}

Garnier had originally planned to install a restaurant in the opera house; however, for budgetary reasons, it was not completed in the original design.

On the third attempt to introduce it since 1875, a restaurant was opened on the eastern side of the building in 2011. [[L'Opéra Restaurant]] was designed by French architect [[Odile Decq]]. The chef was [[Christophe Aribert]];&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opera-restaurant.fr/presse/Communique_Annonce_Chef_EN_2.pdf Paris Opera Restaurant Press Release]&lt;/ref&gt; in October 2015, [[Guillame Tison-Malthé]] became the new head chef.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Guillaume Tison-Malthé, aux fourneaux de L'Opéra Restaurant|url = http://cuisine.journaldesfemmes.com/gastronomie/1435074-l-opera-restaurant-chef-guillaume-tison-malthe/|website = cuisine.journaldesfemmes.com|accessdate = 21 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The restaurant, which has three different spaces and a large outside terrace, is accessible to the general public.

==History==
[[File:Two projected site sites for the new Paris Opera by Barnout - Gallica 2014.jpg|thumb|upright|Two proposed sites for a new opera house, c. 1856, with alternative routes for a broad avenue leading from the [[Louvre Palace|Louvre]] to the new theatre (the future [[Avenue de l'Opéra]])]]

===Selection of a site===
In 1821 the Opéra de Paris had moved into the temporary building known as the [[Salle Le Peletier]] on the {{Interlanguage link multi|Rue Le Peletier|fr|lt=rue Le Peletier|vertical-align=sup}}. Since then a new permanent building had been desired. [[Charles Rohault de Fleury]], who was appointed the opera's official architect in 1846, undertook various studies in suitable sites and designs.&lt;ref&gt;Mead 1991, p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1847, the [[Prefect (France)|Prefect]] of the [[Seine (department)|Seine]], [[Claude-Philibert de Rambuteau]], had selected a site on the east side of the Place du Palais-Royal as part of an extension of the [[Rue de Rivoli, Paris|Rue de Rivoli]]. However, with the [[French Revolution of 1848|Revolution of 1848]], Rambuteau was dismissed, and interest in the construction of a new opera house waned. The site was later used for the [[Grand Hôtel du Louvre]] (designed in part by Charles Rohault de Fleury).&lt;ref&gt;Kirkland 2014, pp. 188–189.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the establishment of the [[Second French Empire|Second Empire]] in 1852 and [[Georges-Eugène Haussmann]]'s appointment as Prefect of the Seine in June 1853, interest in a new opera house revived. There was an attempted assassination of [[Napoleon III of France|Emperor Napoleon III]] at the entrance to the Salle Le Peletier on 14 January 1858. The Salle Le Peletier's constricted street access highlighted the need for a separate, more secure entrance for the head of state. This concern and the inadequate facilities and temporary nature of the theatre gave added urgency to the building of a new state-funded opera house. By March Haussmann settled on Rohault de Fleury's proposed site off the Boulevard des Capucines, although this decision was not announced publicly until 1860. A new building would help resolve the awkward convergence of streets at this location, and the site was economical in terms of the cost of land.&lt;ref&gt;Mead 1991, pp. 53–56.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
On 29 September 1860 an imperial decree officially designated the site for the new Opéra,&lt;ref&gt;Mead 1991, p. 58; Kirkland. Page 190.&lt;/ref&gt; which would eventually occupy {{convert|12000|m2|ha}}.&lt;ref&gt;Beauvert 1996, p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt; By November 1860 Rohault de Fleury had completed the design for what he thought would be the crowning work of his career and was also working on a commission from the city to design the facades of the other buildings lining the new square to ensure they were in harmony. However that same month [[Achille Fould]] was replaced as minister of state by Count [[Alexandre Colonna-Walewski]]. His wife Marie Anne de Ricci Poniatowska had used her position as mistress of Napoleon III to obtain her husband's appointment.&lt;ref&gt;Kirkland 2013, pp. 185–186.&lt;/ref&gt; Aware of competing designs and under pressure to give the commission to [[Viollet-le-Duc]], who had the support of [[Eugénie de Montijo|Empress Eugénie]], Walewski escaped the need to make a decision by proposing to mount an [[architectural design competition]] to select the architect.&lt;ref&gt;Kirkland 2013, p. 191.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Design competition===

On 30 December 1860 the Second Empire of Emperor [[Napoleon III]] officially announced an architectural design competition for the design of the new opera house.

Applicants were given a month to submit entries. There were two phases to the competition. [[Charles Garnier (architect)|Charles Garnier]]'s project was one of about 170 submitted in the first phase.&lt;ref&gt;Mead 1991, p. 60 ("170 projects"); Kirkland 2013, p. 192 ("171 designs").&lt;/ref&gt; Each of the entrants were required to submit a motto that summarised their design. Garnier's was the quote "Bramo assai, poco spero" ("desire for much, hope for little") from the Italian poet [[Torquato Tasso]].
Garnier's project was awarded the fifth-place prize, and he became one of seven finalists selected for the second phase.&lt;ref&gt;Mead 1991, pp. 60–62. Only five projects were awarded prizes, but two were the result of collaborations.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to Garnier, among the others were his friend Leon Ginain, Alphonse-Nicolas Crépinet and Joseph-Louis Duc (who subsequently withdrew due to other commitments).&lt;ref&gt;Kirkland 2013, p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt; To the surprise of many, both Viollet-le-Duc and Charles Rohault de Fleury missed out.

&lt;center&gt;'''Viollet-de-Duc's losing Opera Competition project of 1861'''&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

The second phase required the contestants to revise their original projects and was more rigorous, with a 58-page program, written by the director of the Opéra, [[Alphonse Royer]], which the contestants received on 18 April. The new submissions were sent to the jury in the middle of May, and on 29 May 1861 Garnier's project was selected for its "rare and superior qualities in the beautiful distribution of the plans, the monumental and characteristic aspect of the facades and sections".&lt;ref name=Mead76&gt;Quoted and translated in Mead 1991, pp. 76, 290.&lt;/ref&gt;

Garnier's wife Louise later wrote that the French architect [[Alphonse de Gisors]], who was on the jury, had commented to them that Garnier's project was "remarkable in its simplicity, clarity, logic, grandeur, and because of the exterior dispositions which distinguish the plan in three distinct parts—the public spaces, auditorium, and stage ... 'you have greatly improved your project since the first competition; whereas Ginain [the first-place winner in the first phase] has ruined his.'"&lt;ref name=Mead76/&gt;

Legend has it that the Emperor's wife, the [[Eugénie de Montijo|Empress Eugénie]], who was likely irritated that her own favoured candidate, Viollet-le-Duc, had not been selected, asked the relatively unknown Garnier: "What is this? It's not a style; it's neither Louis Quatorze, nor Louis Quinze, nor Louis Seize!" "Why Ma'am, it's Napoléon Trois" replied Garnier "and you're complaining!"&lt;ref&gt;Translated and quoted by Ayers 2004, pp. 172–174. The architectural styles mentioned by the empress were those which prevailed during the reigns of Louis XIV, XV, and XVI. For more information, see the sections on Baroque, Rococo, and Neoclassicism in [[French architecture#Baroque|French architecture]].&lt;/ref&gt; Andrew Ayers has written that Garnier's definition "remains undisputed, so much does the Palais Garnier seem emblematic of its time and of the Second Empire that created it. A giddy mixture of up-to-the-minute technology, rather prescriptive rationalism, exuberant eclecticism and astonishing opulence, Garnier's opera encapsulated the divergent tendencies and political and social ambitions of its era."&lt;ref name=Ayers/&gt; Ayers goes on to say that the judges of the competition in particular admired Garnier's design for "the clarity of his plan, which was a brilliant example of the [[Beaux-Arts architecture|''beaux-arts'']] design methods in which both he and they were thoroughly versed."&lt;ref name=Ayers/&gt;

===Opéra Agence===
[[File:Louis-Emile Durandelle, Charles Garnier in the Drafting Room While Designing the New Paris Opera, ca. 1870.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|The Opéra ''Agence'' drafting room: Garnier is second from the right, with Edmond Le Deschault on the far right, and Victor Louvet, second from the left&lt;ref&gt;Photo by {{Interlanguage link multi|Louis-Emile Durandelle|fr|3=Durandelle}}. Mead 1991, p. 138, reproduces a different print (fig. 187) of the same photograph (from the [[Bibliothèque nationale]], see [[:File:Opéra Agence drafting room - Mead 1991 p138.jpg|a copy at Commons]]) and identifies the three men. This particular print is from the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], whose annotator dates it to ca. 1870. The elevation of the opera house shown in the background is quite similar to a design dated to the spring of 1862 by Mead 1991, p. 90 (see [[:File:Palais Garnier elevation principal facade, spring 1862 - Bibliothèque de l'Opéra - Mead 1991 p90.jpg|copy]] at Commons).&lt;/ref&gt;]]

After the initial funds to begin construction were voted on 2 July 1861, Garnier established the Opéra ''Agence'', his office on the construction site, and hired a team of architects and draftsmen. He selected as his second-in-command, Louis-Victor Louvet, followed by Jean Jourdain and Edmond Le Deschault.&lt;ref&gt;Mead 1991, p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Laying of the foundation===
[[File:Palais Garnier foundation work 20 May 1862 - Mead 1991 p147.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Foundation work (20 May 1862)]]

The site was excavated between 27 August and 31 December.&lt;ref&gt;Mead 1991, pp. 146–147.&lt;/ref&gt; On 13 January 1862 the first concrete foundations were poured, starting at the front and progressing sequentially toward the back, with the laying of the substructure masonry beginning as soon as each section of concrete was cast. The opera house needed a much deeper basement in the substage area than other building types, but the level of the groundwater was unexpectedly high. Wells were sunk in February 1862 and eight steam pumps installed in March, but despite operating continuously 24 hours a day, the site would not dry up. To deal with this problem Garnier designed a double foundation to protect the superstructure from moisture. It incorporated a water course and an enormous concrete cistern (''cuve'') which would both relieve the pressure of the external groundwater on the basement walls and serve as a reservoir in case of fire. A contract for its construction was signed on 20 June. Soon a persistent legend arose that the opera house was built over a subterranean lake, inspiring Gaston Leroux to incorporate the idea into his novel ''[[The Phantom of the Opera]]''. On 21 July the cornerstone was laid at the southeast angle of the building's facade. In October the pumps were removed,&lt;!--source needed--&gt; the brick vault of the ''cuve'' was finished by 8 November, and the substructure was essentially complete by the end of the year.&lt;ref&gt;Mead 1991, p. 147; Hanser 2006, p. 174; Ayers 2004, p. 174.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Model===
[[File:Palais Garnier model by Villeminot - Mead 1991 p150.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.2|Villeminot model (May 1863)]]

The emperor expressed an interest in seeing a model of the building, and a plaster scale model (2&amp;nbsp;cm per meter) was constructed by Louis Villeminot between April 1862 and April 1863 at a cost of more than 8,000 francs. After previewing it, the emperor requested several changes to the design of the building, the most important of which was the suppression of a balustraded terrace with corner groups at the top of the facade and its replacement with a massive attic story fronted by a continuous frieze surmounted by imperial ''[[quadriga]]e'' over the end bays.&lt;ref name=Model&gt;Mead 1991, pp. 149–151.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the incorporated changes, the model was transported over specially installed rails to the [[Palais de l'Industrie]] for public display at the 1863 exhibition. [[Théophile Gautier]] wrote of the model (''Le Moniteur Universel'', 13 May 1863) that "the general arrangement becomes intelligible to all eyes and already acquires a sort of reality that better permits one to prejudge the final effect ... it attracts the crowd's curiosity; it is, in effect, the new Opéra seen through reversed opera glasses."&lt;ref&gt;Mead 1991, p. 303.&lt;/ref&gt; The model is now lost, but it was photographed by J. B. Donas in 1863.&lt;ref name=Model/&gt;

The emperor's quadrigae were never added, although they can be seen in the model. Instead [[Charles Gumery|Charles-Alphonse Guméry's]] gilded bronze sculptural groups ''Harmony'' and ''Poetry'' were installed in 1869.  The linear frieze seen in the model was also redesigned with alternating low- and high-relief decorative medallions bearing the gilded letters from the imperial monogram ("N" for Napoléon, "E" for Empereur). The custom-designed letters were not ready in time for the unveiling and were replaced with commercially available substitutes. After the fall of the empire in 1870, Garnier was relieved to be able to remove them from the medallions. Letters in Garnier's original design were finally installed during the restoration of the building in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;Fontaine 2000, pp. 91–92.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Change in name===
{{Multiple image|direction=vertical |image1=Palais Garnier November 1866 covered facade - Delmaet and Durandelle - Mead 1991 p161.jpg |width1=220 |caption1=The facade in November 1866 |image2=Palais Garnier 15 August 1867 facade - Delmaet and Durandelle - Mead 1991 p185.jpg |width2=220 |caption2=The facade on 15 August 1867}}

The scaffolding concealing the facade was removed on 15 August 1867 in time for the [[Exposition Universelle (1867)|Paris Exposition of 1867]]. The official title of the Paris Opera was prominently displayed on the [[entablature]] of the giant [[Corinthian order]] of coupled columns fronting the main-floor [[loggia]]:  "ACADEMIE IMPERIALE DE MUSIQUE".&lt;ref&gt;Mead 1991, p. 185.&lt;/ref&gt; When the emperor was deposed on 4 September 1870 as a result of the disastrous [[Franco-Prussian War]], the government was replaced by the [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]], and almost immediately, on 17 September 1870, the Opera was renamed Théâtre National de l'Opéra, a name it kept until 1939.&lt;ref name=Levin&gt;Levin, Alicia. "A documentary overview of musical theaters in Paris, 1830–1900" in Fauser (2009), p. 382.&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of this, when it came time to change the name on the new opera house, only the first six letters of the word IMPERIALE were replaced, giving the now famous "ACADEMIE NATIONALE DE MUSIQUE", an official title which had actually only been used during the approximately two-year period of the [[French Second Republic|Second Republic]] which had preceded the Second Empire.&lt;ref name=Levin/&gt;

===1870–1871===
All work on the building came to a halt during the Franco-Prussian War due to the [[Siege of Paris (1870-1871)|siege of Paris]] (September 1870 – January 1871). Construction had so advanced that parts of the building could be used as a food warehouse and a hospital. After France's defeat Garnier became seriously ill from the deprivations of the siege and left Paris from March to June to recover on the [[Liguria]]n coast of Italy, while his assistant Louis Louvet remained behind during the turmoil of the [[Paris Commune]] which followed. Louvet wrote several letters to Garnier, which document events relating to the building. Because of the theatre's proximity to the fighting at the [[Place Vendôme]], troops of the [[National Guard (France)|National Guard]] bivouacked there and were in charge of its defence and distributing food to soldiers and civilians. The Commune authorities planned to replace Garnier with another architect, but this unnamed man had not yet appeared when Republican troops ousted the National Guard and gained control over the building on 23 May. By the end of the month the Commune had been severely defeated. The Third Republic had become sufficiently well established by the fall, that on 30 September construction work recommenced, and by late October a small amount of funds were voted by the new legislature for further construction.&lt;ref&gt;Mead 1991, pp. 142–143, 168–170.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1872–1873===
The political leaders of the new government maintained an intense dislike of all things associated with the Second Empire, and many of them regarded the essentially apolitical Garnier as a holdover from that regime. This was especially true during the presidency of [[Adolphe Thiers]] who remained in office until May 1873, but also persisted under his successor [[Marshal MacMahon]]. Economies were demanded, and Garnier was forced to suppress the completion of sections of the building, in particular the Pavillon de l'Empereur (which later became the home of the Opera Library Museum). However, on 28–29 October an overwhelming incentive to complete the new theatre came when the Salle Le Peletier was destroyed by a fire which raged the entire night.&lt;ref&gt;Mead 1991, pp. 143–145. 170–172.&lt;/ref&gt; Garnier was immediately instructed to complete the building as soon as possible.

===Completion===
[[File:Inauguration of the Paris Opera in 1875 by Detaille - Collections of the Château of Versailles (cropped).jpg|325px|thumb|''Inauguration of the Paris Opera in 1875'' ([[Édouard Detaille]], 1878)]]

The cost of completion of the new house during 1874 was more than 7.5&amp;nbsp;million francs, a sum that greatly exceeded the amounts spent in any of the previous thirteen years. The cash-strapped government of the Third Republic resorted to borrowing 4.9&amp;nbsp;million gold francs at an interest rate of six percent from [[François Blanc]], the wealthy financier who managed the [[Monte Carlo Casino]]. Subsequently (from 1876 to 1879) Garnier would oversee the design and construction of the Monte Carlo Casino concert hall, the Salle Garnier, which later became the home of the [[Opéra de Monte Carlo]].&lt;ref&gt;Mead 1991, pp. 145–146; Folli &amp; Merello 2004, p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt;

During 1874 Garnier and his construction team worked feverishly to complete the new Paris opera house, and by 17 October the orchestra was able to conduct an acoustical test of the new auditorium, followed by another on 2 December which was attended by officials, guests, and members of the press. The Paris Opera Ballet danced on the stage on 12 December, and six days later the famous chandelier was lit for the first time.&lt;ref name=Simeone&gt;Simeone 2000, pp. 177–180.&lt;/ref&gt;

The theatre was formally inaugurated on 5 January 1875 with a lavish gala performance attended by Marshal MacMahon, the Lord Mayor of London and King [[Alfonso XII]] of Spain. The program included the overtures to Auber's ''[[La muette de Portici]]'' and Rossini's ''[[William Tell (opera)|William Tell]]'', the first two acts of [[Ludovic Halévy|Halévy]]'s 1835 opera ''[[La Juive]]'' (with [[Gabrielle Krauss]] in the title role), along with "The Consecration of the Swords" from [[Giacomo Meyerbeer|Meyerbeer]]'s 1836 opera ''[[Les Huguenots]]'' and the 1866 ballet ''[[La source (Saint-Léon)|La source]]'' with music by [[Léo Delibes|Delibes]] and [[Ludwig Minkus|Minkus]].&lt;ref&gt;Huebner 2003, [https://books.google.com/books?id=iqoVHY6OrjIC&amp;pg=PA303 p. 303].&lt;/ref&gt; As a soprano had fallen ill one act from [[Charles Gounod]]'s [[Faust (opera)|''Faust'']] and one from [[Ambroise Thomas]]'s [[Hamlet (opera)|''Hamlet'']] had to be omitted. During the intermission Garnier stepped out onto the landing of the grand staircase to receive the approving applause of the audience.

===History of the house since opening===
In 1881 electric lighting was installed. In the 1950s new personnel and freight elevators were installed at the rear of stage, to facilitate the movement of employees in the administration building and the moving of stage scenery.

In 1969, the theatre was given new electrical facilities and, during 1978, part of the original Foyer de la Danse was converted into new rehearsal space for the Ballet company by the architect [[Jean-Loup Roubert]].
During 1994, restoration work began on the theatre. This consisted of modernising the stage machinery and electrical facilities, while restoring and preserving the opulent décor, as well as strengthening the structure and foundation of the building. This restoration was completed in 2007.

==Stamps==
The French Post Office has issued two postage stamps on the building:
The first was issued in September 1998, for the centenary of the death of Charles Garnier. It was designed by Claude Andréotto grouping elements which recall the artistic activities of the Opera Garnier: the profile of a dancer, a violin and a red curtain.
The second, drawn and engraved by Martin Mörck, is issued in June 2006 and represents, in intaglio, the main facade.

==Influence abroad==
The building inspired many other buildings over the following thirty years.

Several buildings in [[Poland]] were based on the design of the Palais Garnier. these include the [[Juliusz Słowacki Theatre]] in [[Kraków]], built during 1893 and also the Warsaw Philharmony edifice in [[Warsaw]], built between 1900 and 1901.

In Ukraine, the influence of the Palais Garnier can be seen at the [[National Opera House of Ukraine]] in [[Kiev]], built in 1901, [[Lviv Theatre of Opera and Ballet]] in [[Lviv]], built between 1897 and 1900.

The [[Thomas Jefferson Building]] of the [[Library of Congress]] in Washington, D.C. is modelled after the Palais Garnier, most notably the facade and Great Hall.&lt;ref&gt;Scott &amp; Lee 1993, pp. 142–145.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Teatro Municipal (Rio de Janeiro)|Theatro Municipal do Rio de Janeiro]] (1909) was also modelled after Palais Garnier, particularly and Great Hall and stairs.

The [[Amazon Theatre]] in Manaus (Brazil) built from 1884 to 1896. The overview is very similar, though the decoration is simpler.

The [[Hanoi Opera House]] in Vietnam is considered to be a typical French colonial architectural monument in Vietnam, and it is also a small-scale replica of the Palais Garnier. The [[Municipal Theatre, Ho Chi Minh City|Saigon Opera House]] is a smaller counterpart.

The Legends Hotel Chennai in India is also a small scale replica of Palais Garnier, especially the Facade and statues.

"'''Shangri-La'''" is a song written by [[Ray Davies]] of [[The Kinks]]. The song appeared on the 1969 [[concept album]], ''[[Arthur (Or the Decline and Fall of the British Empire)]].'' The song's inspiration can be traced back to when the band visited the Davies brothers' sister, Rose, and her family in Australia, the "designed community" that the family lived in serving as the initial lyrical inspiration.  The song's highly ironic lyrics comment on British class society while portraying Arthur, the album's ill-fated protagonist, and his empty life in the suburbs.  The musical aspects of the song both reflect and comment on the mood of the lyrics.

"Shangri-La" was released as the second single from ''Arthur'' in the United Kingdom, backed with "This Man He Weeps Tonight." The single was a commercial failure, not reaching the charts in any countries besides the Netherlands. The members of the band, however, thought highly of the song, with both [[Dave Davies]] and [[John Dalton (musician)|John Dalton]] singling it out for praise.

==Lyrics and music==

The initial inspiration for "Shangri-La" came when Rose Davies, the sister of Kinks members Ray and Dave Davies, moved with her husband to Australia.&lt;ref name=allday/&gt; When the band performed a show in the area during January 1964, the Davies brothers visited their sister in the [[Adelaide]] village, Little Elizabeth, where she and her family lived in a semi-detached home in a "[[Planned community|designed community]]."&lt;ref name="allday"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hinman|first1=Doug|title=The Kinks: All Day and All of the Night|publisher=Backbeat Books|pages=144–162|accessdate=4 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This event was later used as the basis for the song in 1969.

The track forms the centrepiece of ''Arthur (Or the Decline and Fall of the British Empire)''.&lt;ref name=rogan/&gt;  The song opens quietly with the picking of an [[acoustic guitar]] in a [[Key (music)|minor key]], soon to be joined by Davies singing.&lt;ref name="Emlen (Chords/Lyrics)"&gt;{{cite web|title=Chords for "Shangri-la"|url=http://www.kindakinks.net/discography/showsong.php?chord=347|website=Dave Emlen's Unoficial Kinks Web Site|publisher=Dave Emlen's Unoficial Kinks Web site|accessdate=4 December 2015}} - chords and lyrics&lt;/ref&gt;  The lyrics are rife with commentary on British [[Social class|class society]] and are highly [[Irony|ironic]], and in the beginning seemingly condescending, as they mock the illusions of the protagonist Arthur, speaking of his modest home, which he has paid for through a life of toil and hard work, as if it is a some kind of paradise or "kingdom to command," replete with typical modern conveniences such as indoor plumbing and a rocking chair, unlike the kind of working class house in which he grew up with "lavatories in the back yard," but which has turned out to become strangling and prisonlike with "mortgage hanging over his head," "bills and the water rates and payments on the car," as well as nosy and meddlesome neighbors.&lt;ref name="Wawzenek (Arthur)"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wawzenek|first1=Bryan|title=46 Years Ago: The Kinks’ Heady Ambitions Drive ‘Arthur’|url=http://ultimateclassicrock.com/the-kinks-arthur/|website=Ultimate Classic Rock|publisher=Ultimate Classic Rock|accessdate=4 December 2015|date=10 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mitchner (irony in Shangri La)"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mitchner|first1=Stuart|title=Put the Kettle On, Mate, and Have a Cuppa Ray Davies|url=http://www.towntopics.com/mar0106/book.html|website=Record Review|publisher=Record Review|accessdate=4 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=rogan/&gt;&lt;ref name=kitts/&gt;&lt;ref name="doctorjimmy (Shagri La)"&gt;{{cite web|last1=n/a|first1=doctorjimmy|title=The Kinks-  Arthur (Or the Decline and Fall of the British Empire)|url=https://www.sputnikmusic.com/review/68258/The-Kinks-Arthur-Or-the-Decline-and-Fall-of-the-British-Empire/|website=Sputnik Music|publisher=Sputnik Music|accessdate=4 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Emlen (Chords/Lyrics)"/&gt;  Davies provides a note of empathy for Arthur's empty life in a line stating that he accepts this because "he's conditioned that way."&lt;ref name=kitts/&gt;  However, the [[bridge (music)|bridge]] rocks harder as the lyrics express anger at the superficial suburban lifestyle that Arthur has bought into and his fear of confronting a "false Eden."&lt;ref name=kitts/&gt;

The band's guitarist, [[Dave Davies]], has since said that the song's lyrics were misunderstood. He said, "Particularly, I like 'Shangri-La,' a very compassionate song which was totally misinterpreted as though we were having a go at the little, common man."&lt;ref name="out of the survivors"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Resnicoff|first1=Matt|title=Dave Davies - Out Of The Survivors|journal=Guitar Player|date=March 1990|url=http://www.davedavies.com/articles/gp_0390.htm|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923212828/http://www.davedavies.com/articles/gp_0390.htm|archivedate=23 September 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Music critic [[Johnny Rogan]] calls the song "one of Davies' best from the period," noting that "his ambivalence to the subject is evident throughout as he takes an alternately affectionate and sardonic look at cosy middle class aspiration."&lt;ref name=rogan&gt;{{cite book|title=The Complete Guide to the Music of the Kinks|author=[[Johnny Rogan|Rogan, J.]]|page=71|year=1998|publisher=Omnibus Press|isbn=0711963142}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Allmusic]] critic Stewart Mason agrees that "Shangri-La" is "one of Ray Davies' finest songs ever."&lt;ref name=allmusic&gt;{{cite web|title=Shangri-La|author=Mason, S.|url=http://www.allmusic.com/song/shangri-la-mt0014690883|publisher=[[Allmusic]]|accessdate=2012-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  George Starostin, on his music review website "Only Solitaire", praises the song, saying that it "ranks as one of the top three or four Kinks' songs ever".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Starostin |first1=George |title=The Kinks |url=http://starling.rinet.ru/music/kinks.htm#Arthur |website=Only Solitaire |accessdate=16 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Shangri-La" was released as a single in Britain, but like the Kinks previous single, "[[Drivin' (The Kinks song)|Drivin]],{{'"}} "Shangri-La" failed to chart in the UK or US.&lt;ref name=kitts&gt;{{cite book|title=Ray Davies: Not Like Everybody Else|author=Kitts, T.M.|pages=137–140|year=2008|publisher=Routledge|isbn=041597769X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dave Davies has since expressed disappointment in the single's lack of commercial success, saying, "Ray was writing fantastic, sensitive words that were so relevant to what was going on - better than any politician. I was really surprised at the response we got to (single) 'Shangri-La,' because I thought it was going to be a massive, massive hit."&lt;ref name=comebackkink&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hunter|first1=Dave|title=Comeback Kink|journal=The Guitar Magazine|date=January 1999|url=http://www.davedavies.com/articles/tgm_0199.htm|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923212833/http://www.davedavies.com/articles/tgm_0199.htm|archivedate=23 September 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to say, "As a creative person you may think you've failed at something, then find out later that you've really learned from it. I wish I'd realised that when I was feeling really shitty about 'Shangri-La' not being number one." It did reach number 27 in the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kindakinks.net/charts.html|title=International Chart Positions|author=Emlen, Dave|work=Kindakinks.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bassist [[John Dalton (musician)|John Dalton]] named the track his favorite Kinks song.&lt;ref name="kok interview"&gt;{{cite web|title=THEY JUST WANTED ME TO LOOK ALL RIGHT…  AND BE AN ARSENAL SUPPORTER!|url=http://kastoffkinks.co.uk/John%20Dalton%20interview%20part%201.htm|website=Kast Off Kinks}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tale of two brothers.jpg|thumb|Sheet from the ''Tale of Two Brothers'', Papyrus D'Orbiney, [[British Museum]]]]
The '''''Tale of Two Brothers''''' is an [[ancient Egypt]]ian story that dates from the reign of [[Seti II]], who ruled from 1200 to 1194 BC during the 19th Dynasty of the [[New Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;Jacobus Van Dijk, "The Amarna Period and the Later New Kingdom," in "The Oxford History of Ancient Egypt" ed. Ian Shaw. (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2000) p. 303&lt;/ref&gt; The story is preserved on the Papyrus D'Orbiney,&lt;ref&gt;https://archive.org/stream/papyrusdorbineyb00britrich#page/n5/mode/2up&lt;/ref&gt; which is currently preserved in the British Museum.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/aes/s/sheet_from_the_tale_of_two_bro.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
The story centers around two brothers: Anpu ([[Anubis]]), who is married, and the younger [[Bata (god)|Bata]]. The brothers work together, farming land and raising cattle. One day, Anpu's wife attempts to seduce Bata. When he strongly rejects her advances, the wife tells her husband that his brother attempted to seduce her and beat her when she refused. In response to this, Anpu attempts to kill Bata, who flees and prays to [[Re-Harakhti]] to save him. The god creates a crocodile-infested lake between the two brothers, across which Bata is finally able to appeal to his brother and share his side of the events. To emphasize his sincerity, Bata severs his [[genitalia]] and throws them into the water, where a [[catfish]] eats them.

Bata states that he is going to the [[Valley of Cedars]], where he will place his heart on the top of the blossom of a cedar tree, so that if it is cut down Anpu will be able to find it and allow Bata to become alive again. Bata tells Anpu that if he is ever given a jar of beer that froths, he should know to seek out his brother. After hearing of his brother's plan, Anpu returns home and kills his wife. Meanwhile, Bata is establishing a life in the Valley of the Cedar, building a new home for himself. Bata comes upon the [[Ennead]], or the principal Egyptian deities, who take pity on him. [[Khnum]], the god frequently depicted in Egyptian mythology as having fashioned humans on a potters' wheel, creates a wife for Bata. Because of her divine creation, Bata's wife is sought after by the pharaoh. When the pharaoh succeeds in bringing her to live with him, she tells him to cut down the tree in which Bata has put his heart. They do so, and Bata dies.

Anpu then receives a frothy jar of beer and sets off to the Valley of the Cedar. He searches for his brother's heart for more than three years, finding it at the beginning of the fourth year. He follows Bata's instructions and puts the heart in a bowl of cold water. As predicted, Bata is resurrected.

Bata then takes the form of a bull and goes to see his wife and the pharaoh. His wife, aware of his presence as a bull, asks the pharaoh if she may eat its liver. The bull is then sacrificed, and two drops of Bata's blood fall, from which grow two [[Persea]] trees. Bata, now in the form of a tree, again addresses his wife, and she appeals to the pharaoh to cut down the Persea trees and use them to make furniture. As this is happening, a splinter ends up in the wife's mouth, impregnating her. She eventually gives birth to a son, whom the pharaoh ultimately makes crown prince. When the pharaoh dies, the crown prince (a resurrected Bata) becomes king, and he appoints his elder brother Anpu as crown prince. The story ends happily, with the brothers at peace with one another and in control of their country.

==Context and themes==
There are several themes present in the ''Tale of Two Brothers'' that are significant to ancient Egyptian culture. One of these is kingship. The second half of the tale deals largely with Egyptian ideas of kingship and the connection between divinity and the pharaoh. That Bata's wife ultimately ends up pregnant with him is a reference the duality of the role of women in pharaonic succession; the roles of wife and mother were often simultaneous. Also, the divine aspect of his wife's creation could be seen to serve as legitimacy for the kingship of Bata, especially since he was not actually the child of the pharaoh. Beyond this, Bata's closeness with the Ennead in the middle of the story also serves to legitimize his rule; the gods bestowed divine favor upon Bata in his time of need.

There are also several references to the separation of Egypt into two lands. Throughout ancient Egyptian history, even when the country is politically unified and stable, it is acknowledged that there are two areas: [[Lower Egypt]], the area in the north including the [[Nile Delta]], and [[Upper Egypt]], the area to the south. In the beginning of the story, Bata is referred to as unique because there was "none like him in the entire land, for a god's virility was in him."&lt;ref&gt;William Kelly Simpson, "The Literature of Ancient Egypt: An Anthology of Stories, Instructions, Stelae, Autobiographies, and Poetry" (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2003) p. 81&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, whenever one of the brothers becomes angry, they are said to behave like an "Upper Egyptian panther," or, in another translation, like "a cheetah of the south."&lt;ref&gt;Gaston Maspero, "Popular Stories in Ancient Egypt" (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2002) p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpretation and analysis==
There are several issues to consider when analyzing ancient Egyptian literature in general, and the ''Tale of Two Brothers'' is no different. One difficulty of analyzing the literature of ancient Egypt is that "such scarcity of sources gives to the observation of any kind of historical development within Ancient Egyptian literature a highly hypothetical status and makes the reconstruction of any intertextual networks perhaps simply impossible."&lt;ref&gt;[[Hans Ulrich Gumbrecht]], "Does Egyptology need a 'theory of literature'?" in "Ancient Egyptian Literature" ed. Antonio Loprieno. (Leiden, The Netherlands: E.J. Brill, 1996) p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; Loprieno notes that the [[Euhemerism|euhemeristic]] theory is often successfully employed in the analysis of ancient Egyptian literature; this the historiocentric method of analyzing literature as it pertained to political events.&lt;ref&gt;Antonio Lopreino, "Defining Egyptian Literature: Ancient Texts and Modern Theories" in "Ancient Egyptian Literature" ed. Antonio Lopreino. (Leiden, The Netherlands: E.J. Brill, 1996) p. 40&lt;/ref&gt;

With relation to the ''Tale of Two Brothers'', Susan Tower Hollis also advocates this approach, saying that the story might "contain reflexes of an actual historical situation."&lt;ref&gt;Susan T. Hollis, "The Ancient Egyptian Tale of Two Brothers: The Oldest Fairy Tale in the World" (Oklahoma: University of Oklahoma Press, 1996)&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, Hollis speculates that the story might have had its origins in the succession dispute following [[Merneptah]]'s reign at the end of the 13th century BC. When Merneptah died, [[Seti II]] was undoubtedly the rightful heir to the throne, but he was challenged by [[Amenmesse]], who ruled for at least a few years in Upper Egypt, although Seti II ultimately ruled for six full years.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobus Van Dijk, "The Amarna Period and the Later New Kingdom," in "The Oxford History of Ancient Egypt" ed. Ian Shaw. (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2000) p. 303&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biblical parallels==
Because of the Egyptian location wherein the scene is staged, it is not impossible to detect in the biblical account of [[Joseph (patriarch)|Joseph]] and [[Potiphar|Potiphar's wife]] a more recent echo of the very old Egyptian fable of the two brothers Bata and Anpu.&lt;ref name="Jr.Wegner2017"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Walter C. Kaiser, Jr.|author2=Paul D Wegner|title=A History of Israel: From the Bronze Age through the Jewish Wars|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dy9DDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT264|date=20 November 2017|publisher=B&amp;H Publishing Group|isbn=978-1-4336-4317-0|page=264}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The Envoys of Agamemnon by Ingres.jpg|thumb|250px]]
'''''The Ambassadors of Agamemnon in the tent of Achilles''''' is an 1801 painting by [[Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres]], produced for the [[Prix de Rome]] competition. It is now in the [[École nationale supérieure des beaux-arts]] in [[Paris]].

It shows an episode from Homer's ''[[Iliad]]'', in which [[Achilles]] refuses to listen to the envoys sent by [[Agamemnon]] to convince him back into the [[Trojan War]]. The topic assigned for the artists competing for the Prix de Rome in 1801 was the warriors' procession toward battle; Ingres' interpretation of the subject characteristically emphasized a moment of psychological drama instead of physical action.&lt;ref&gt;Condon et al. 1983, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; The work was intended as a demonstration of Ingres' mastery of the human figure in classical history painting – [[Odysseus]] is shown in a red cloak derived from a sculpture by Pseudo-Phidias. 

The painting is in the neo-classical style and belongs to the school of [[Jacques-Louis David]], in whose studio Ingres had trained. It also shows new influences from [[John Flaxman]], whose work had just had its first [[Paris]]ian exhibition.&lt;ref name="Adams2016"&gt;{{cite book|author=Arron Adams|title=Ingres: His Palette|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g1D_CwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT5|date=18 April 2016|publisher=Arron Adams|isbn=978-605-04-2285-6|pages=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Top-left lighting''' is an artistic convention in which illustrations are produced so that the light appears to come from the top left of the picture.

Most people prefer lighting from the left when resolving a convex-concave ambiguity, and this preference may be stronger for [[right-handedness|right-handed]] people.  This is reflected in [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[mosaic]]s and in [[Renaissance painting|Renaissance]], [[baroque painting|baroque]] and [[Impressionism|impressionist]] art.&lt;ref&gt;J. Sun and P. Perona, "Where is the sun?", ''Nature Neuroscience'', 1(3), 183-184, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McManus|first=I Christopher|author2=Joseph Buckman |author3=Euan Woolley |title=Is light in pictures presumed to come from the left side?|journal=Perception|date=2004|volume=33|page=1422|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ian_Mcmanus/publication/8003531_Is_light_in_pictures_presumed_to_come_from_the_left_side/file/79e4151052666c381c.pdf|accessdate=4 March 2014|doi=10.1068/p5289}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In cartography, the predominant custom of placing the shadow on the right-hand side of [[cartographic relief depiction#Hill profiles|hill profiles]] was established during the 15th century.&lt;ref&gt;E. Imhof, ''Cartographic Relief Presentation'', Walter de Gruyter, 1982, reissued by ESRI Press, 2007, {{ISBN|978-1-58948-026-1}}, pp. 2-3.&lt;/ref&gt;  Computer interfaces tend to use top left lighting as well, although this trend has gradually shifted more towards light coming straight from the top.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

There are notable exceptions to this convention, such as Sandro Botticelli's [[The_Birth_of_Venus_(Botticelli)|The Birth of Venus]] due to the point of view which may represent geographical perspective and location.

The '''Treasure of Villena''' ({{lang-es|Tesoro de [[Villena]]}}) is one of the greatest [[hoard]] finds of [[gold]] of the European [[Bronze Age]]. It comprises 59 objects made of gold, [[silver]], [[iron]] and [[amber]] with a total weight of almost 10 kilos, 9 of them of 23.5 karat gold. This makes it the most important find of prehistoric gold in the [[Iberian Peninsula]] and second in Europe, just behind that from the [[Grave Circle A, Mycenae|Royal Graves]] in [[Mycenae]], Greece.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= [Spanish] Culture and Education Ministry|editor1-first= |editor1-last= |editor1-link= |date=26 February 2003|title= RESOLUCIÓN de 7 de enero de 2003, de la Dirección General de Patrimonio Artístico de la Consejería de Cultura y Educación, por la que se incoa expediente de declaración de bien de interés cultural a favor de la colección arqueológica del Tesoro de Villena.|trans-title=January 7, 2003, RESOLUTION of the General Direction on Artistic Heritage of the Culture and Education Council, which opens a file on the declaration as Good of Cultural Interest (BIC) the archaeologic collection known as Treasure of Villena|journal= [Spanish] State Official Bulletin (BOE)|volume= |series= |issue= 49|page= |pages= 7798–7802|publisher= Spanish Government|location= Madrid|issn= |pmid= |pmc= |doi= |bibcode= |oclc= |id= |url= http://www.boe.es/boe/dias/2003/02/26/pdfs/A07798-07802.pdf|language= Spanish|format= pdf|accessdate= December 6, 2009|laysummary= |laysource= |laydate= |quote= Desde el punto de vista histórico, artístico y arqueológico, el Tesoro de Villena constituye un «unicum», un depósito no normalizado, por su peso y contenido (A.

From a historic, artistic and archaeological point of view, the Treasure of Villena constitutes a "unicum", a non-normalised deposit, according to its weight and content (A. Perea). In fact, '''''it is the second most important golden tableware finding in Europe''''', after that of the Royal Graves in Mycenae in Greece (A. Mederos)|ref= |postscript= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The gold pieces include eleven bowls, three bottles and 28 bracelets.

The iron pieces are the oldest found in the Iberian Peninsula and correspond to a stage in which iron was considered to be a [[precious metal]], and so was hoarded. The archaeologists estimate the date of this trove at c. 1000 BC.

The hoard was found in December 1963 by archaeologist [[José María Soler]] 5&amp;nbsp;km from [[Villena]], and since then has been the main attraction of Villena's Archaeological Museum. Its discovery was published in most of the Spanish media and also some abroad, mainly in France, Germany and the United States of America. It has been exhibited in [[Madrid]], [[Alicante]], [[Tokyo]] and [[Kyoto]], and now there are two sets of copies of the whole treasure to be shown in exhibitions while the originals are permanently conserved in an armoured showcase at Villena's Archaeological Museum.

The same type of metalwork is also found in the big [[Eberswalde Hoard]] that was discovered in [[Brandenburg]], Germany, in 1913.

[[File:Viktor Vasnetsov Signature 1886.png|thumb|260px|Signature by Viktor Vasnetsov. 1886]]
'''Viktor Mikhaylovich Vasnetsov''' ({{lang-ru|Ви́ктор Миха́йлович Васнецо́в}}; May 15 ([[New Style|N.S.]]), 1848 – July 23, 1926) was a [[Russia]]n [[artist]] who specialized in [[mythology|mythological]] and [[history|historical]] subjects. He is considered the co-founder of Russian folklorist and [[romantic nationalism|romantic nationalistic]] painting&lt;ref name="krugosvet"&gt;{{cite web | author = | date = 
| url = http://www.krugosvet.ru/enc/kultura_i_obrazovanie/izobrazitelnoe_iskusstvo/VASNETSOV_VIKTOR_MIHALOVICH.html| title = Васнецов, Виктор Михайлович | publisher = www.krugosvet.ru|accessdate    = 2011-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; (see also [[neo-romanticism]]), and a key figure in the [[Russian Revival|Russian revivalist]] movement.

==Biography==

===Childhood (1848–58)===
Viktor Vasnetsov was born in the remote village of Lopyal in [[Vyatka Governorate]] in 1848, the second of the six children.&lt;ref name="smr"&gt;{{cite web | author = 
| date = | url =http://www.centre.smr.ru/win/artists/vasnec_v/biogr_vasnec1.htm
| title = Богатырь русской живописи| publisher = www.centre.smr.ru| accessdate = 2011-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father Mikhail Vasilievich Vasnetsov, known to be philosophically inclined, was a member of priesthood, and of scholarly dictation in the [[natural sciences]] and [[astronomy]]. His grandfather was an [[icon]] painter. Two of Mikhail Vasnetsov's three sons, Viktor and [[Apollinary Vasnetsov|Apollinary]], became remarkable painters, the third one becoming a schoolteacher. It was in Lopyal that Viktor started to paint, mostly landscapes and scenes of village life. Recalling his childhood in a letter to [[Vladimir Stasov]], Vasnetsov remarked that he "had lived with peasant children and liked them not as a [[narodnik]] but as a friend".&lt;ref name="smr"/&gt;

===Vyatka (1858–67)===
From the age of ten, Viktor studied in a seminary in Vyatka, each summer moving with his family to a rich merchant village of Ryabovo. During his seminary years, he worked for a local [[icon]] shopkeeper. He also helped an exiled [[Poland|Polish]] artist, [[Michał Elwiro Andriolli]], to execute [[fresco]]es for Vyatka's [[Alexander Nevsky]] cathedral.

Having graduated from the seminary, Viktor decided to move to [[Saint Petersburg]] to study art. He auctioned his paintings of ''Woman Harvester'' and ''Milk-maid'' (both 1867) in order to raise money required for the trip to the Russian capital.

===Saint Petersburg (1867–76)===
[[File:Vasnetsov Moving House.jpg|thumb|260px|''Moving House'', 1876]]
In August 1867 Viktor entered the [[Imperial Academy of Arts]]. Three years later, the [[Peredvizhniki]] movement of realist painters rebelled against the [[Academism]].

Vasnetsov befriended their leader [[Ivan Kramskoi]], referring to him as his teacher. He also became very close to his fellow student [[Ilya Yefimovich Repin]].

It is ironic, but Viktor, whose name is associated with historical and mythological paintings, initially avoided these subjects at all costs. For his graphic composition of ''[[Christ]] and [[Pontius Pilate]] Before the People'', the Academy awarded a small silver medal to him.

In the early 1870s he executed a lot of [[engraving]]s depicting contemporary life. Two of them (''Provincial Bookseller'' from 1870 and ''A Boy with a Bottle of Vodka'' from 1872) won him a bronze medal at the [[World Fair]] in [[London]] (1874).

At that period he also started producing [[Genre works|genre paintings]] in oil. Such pieces as ''Peasant Singers'' (1873) and ''Moving House'' (1876) were warmly welcomed by democratic circles of Russian society.

===Paris (1876–77)===
In 1876 Repin invited Vasnetsov to join the Peredvizhniki colony in [[Paris]]. While living in France, Viktor studied classical and contemporary paintings, academist and [[Impressionism|Impressionist]] alike. At that period, he painted ''Acrobats'' (1877), produced prints, and exhibited some of his works at the [[Paris Salon|Salon]]. It was in Paris that he became fascinated with fairy-tale subjects, starting to work on ''[[Ivan Tsarevich]] Riding a Grey Wolf'' and ''The Firebird''. Vasnetsov was a model for [[Sadko]] in Repin's celebrated painting ''[[:Image:Sadko.jpg|Sadko in the Underwater Kingdom]]''. In 1877 he returned to [[Moscow]].

===Moscow (1877–84)===
[[File:Vasnetsov samolet.jpg|thumb|260px|''[[The Flying Carpet (painting)|The Flying Carpet]]'', 1880]]
In the late 1870s Vasnetsov concentrated on illustrating Russian fairy tales and the epic narrative poem [[Bylina]]s, executing some of his best known pieces: ''[[:Image:TheKnightAtTheCrossroads.jpg|The Knight at the Crossroads]]'' (1878), ''[[Prince Igor]]'s Battlefield'' (1878),
''[[:File:Три царевны подземного царства.jpg|Three princesses of the Underground Kingdom]]'' (completed 1884 ), ''The Flying Carpet'' (1880), and ''Alionushka'' (1881).

These works were not appreciated at the time they appeared. Many radical critics dismissed them as undermining the realist principles of the [[Peredvizhniki]]. Even such prominent connoisseurs as [[Pavel Mikhailovich Tretyakov]] refused to buy them. The vogue for Vasnetsov's paintings would spread in the 1880s, when he turned to religious subjects and executed a series of icons for [[Abramtsevo Colony|Abramtsevo]] estate of his patron [[Savva Mamontov]].

===Kiev (1884–89)===
[[File:Vasnetsov Bapt Vladimir fresco in Kiev.jpg|thumb|260px|''Baptism of [[Vladimir the Great|Prince Vladimir]]'', a Vasnetsov fresco, St. Vladimir's Cathedral in Kiev]] [[Image:Apocalypse vasnetsov.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse (painting)|''Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse'']] (1887) by Vasnetsov, St. Vladimir's Cathedral]]In 1884-1889 Vasnetsov was commissioned to paint [[fresco]]s in the [[St Volodymyr's Cathedral|St Vladimir's Cathedral]] of [[Kiev]]. This was a challenging work which ran contrary to both Russian and Western traditions of religious paintings. The influential art critic [[Vladimir Stasov]] labelled them a sacrilegious play with religious feelings of the Russian people. Another popular critic, [[Dmitry Filosofov]], referred to these frescoes as "the first bridge over 200 years-old gulf separating different classes of Russian society".

While living in Kiev, Vasnetsov made friends with [[Mikhail Vrubel]], who was also involved in the cathedral's decoration. While they worked together, Vasnetsov taught the younger artist a great deal. It was in Kiev that Vasnetsov finally finished ''[[Ivan Tsarevich]] Riding a Grey Wolf'' and started his most famous painting, the ''[[Bogatyr]]s''.

In 1885 the painter travelled to [[Italy]]. The same year he worked on stage designs and costumes for [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov]]'s opera ''[[Snegurochka (opera)|The Snow Maiden]]''.

===Later years (1890–1926)===
[[File:1898 Vasnetsov Bogatyrs anagoria.JPG|thumb|260px|''[[Bogatyrs]]'' (1898), one of Vasnetsov's most famous paintings, depicts mythical Russian knights [[Dobrynya Nikitich]], [[Ilya Muromets]] and [[Alyosha Popovich]].]]
The following two decades were productive for Vasnetsov. He increasingly turned to other media during this period. In 1897 he collaborated with his brother Apollinary on the theatrical design of another Rimsky-Korsakov premiere, ''[[Sadko (opera)|Sadko]]''.

At the turn of the century, Vasnetsov elaborated his hallmark "fairy-tale" style of [[Russian Revival]]ist architecture. His first acclaimed design was a church in [[Abramtsevo, Sergiyevo-Posadsky District, Moscow Oblast|Abramtsevo]] (1882), executed jointly with [[Vasily Polenov]]. In 1894, he designed his own mansion in [[Moscow]]. The Russian pavilion of the World Fair in [[Paris]] followed in 1898. Finally, in 1904, Vasnetsov designed the best known of his "fairy-tale" buildings — the façade of the [[Tretyakov Gallery]].

Between 1906 and 1911, Vasnetsov worked on the design of the mosaics for [[Alexander Nevsky Cathedral, Warsaw]]; he was also involved in the design of [[Alexander Nevsky Cathedral, Moscow]].

[[File:Stamps of Moskow Vasnetsov.jpg|thumb|260px|A [[revenue stamp]] of [[Russia]], 1914]]
In 1912, he was given a noble title by [[Czar Nicholas II]]. In 1914, he designed a revenue stamp intended for voluntary collection for victims of World War I.

Even prior to the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]], Vasnetsov became active as a regent of the Tretyakov Gallery. He allocated a significant portion of his income to the [[State Historical Museum]], so that a large part of the museum's collection was acquired on Vasnetsov's money. After the [[October Revolution]] he advocated removing some of the religious paintings (notably those by [[Alexander Ivanov (painter)|Alexander Ivanov]]) from churches to the Tretyakov Gallery.

In 1915 Vasnetsov participated in the designing of a military uniform for the Victory parade of Russian army in Berlin and Constantinopole. Vasnetsov is credited with the creation of the [[budenovka]] (initially named ''bogatyrka''), a military hat reproducing the style of [[Kievan Rus'|ancient Rus']] [[Cone (geometry)|cone]]-shaped helmets.

He died in Moscow in 1926.

==Legacy==
[[File:Vasnetsov Ioann 4.jpg|thumbnail|260px|Vasnetsov's painting of Ivan the Terrible]]
A [[minor planet]] [[3586 Vasnetsov]], discovered by [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] astronomer [[Lyudmila Zhuravlyova]] in 1978 is named after Viktor Vasnetsov and Apollinary Vasnetsov.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Schmadel | first = Lutz D. | coauthors = | title = Dictionary of Minor Planet Names | edition = 5th  | year = 2003 | publisher = Springer Verlag | location = New York | url = https://books.google.com/books?q=3575+Anyuta  | isbn = 3-540-00238-3 | page = 301}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the film ''[[Elizabeth: The Golden Age]]'', Vasnetsov's painting of [[Ivan the Terrible]] is anachronistically presented as if it already existed in that Tsar's lifetime, and as being sent by Ivan to England when he offers to marry [[Queen Elizabeth I]].

Vasnetsov's grandson was [[People's Artist of the USSR]] [[Andrei Vasnetsov]].
