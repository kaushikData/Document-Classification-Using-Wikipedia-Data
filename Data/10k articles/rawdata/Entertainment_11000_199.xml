}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first followup to Capcom's earlier ''[[1942 (video game)|1942]]''.

==Gameplay==
[[Image:1943 arcade.png|thumb|left|225 px|Gameplay screenshot of ''1943'']] The game is set in the [[Asiatic-Pacific Theater|Pacific theater]] of [[World War II]], off the coast of the [[Midway Atoll]]. The goal is to attack the Japanese air fleet that bombed the American aircraft carrier, pursue all Japanese air and sea forces, fly through the 16 [[Level (video gaming)|stage]]s of play, and make their way to the [[Japanese battleship Yamato]] and destroy her. 11 of these stages consist of an air-to-sea battle (with a huge battleship or an aircraft carrier as the stage boss), while 5 stages consist of an all-aerial battle against a squadron of Japanese bombers with a mother bomber at the end.

As in ''[[1942 (video game)|1942]]'', players pilot a [[P-38 Lightning]]. Controls are also similar: button 1 fires main weapons, and button 2 performs two special actions: a loop maneuver like in ''[[1942 (video game)|1942]]'', or one of three special lightning attacks in exchange for some of the player's fuel. Indeed, players now have only one life, in the form of a large "fuel" meter; constantly depleting, but refillable by collecting various powerups (chiefly "Pow" icons). In 2-player mode, when both players overlap their planes on screen, the energy bar can be transferred from the player with more fuel to the player with less. Destroying a complete formation of red enemy planes will result in a [[power-up]], such as a health boost or a new main weapon.

There are cheat codes, different for every stage, ranging from holding down a fire button or pointing the joystick in a certain direction; player(s) are rewarded with fully upgraded weapons.

==Ports==
Capcom released their own port for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]], but the game has also been ported to the [[Atari ST]], the [[ZX Spectrum]], the [[Amstrad CPC]], the [[Commodore 64]] and the [[Amiga]]. In 1998 it was rereleased as ''[[Capcom Generations|Capcom Generation 1]]'' for the Sega Saturn and the PlayStation. In {{vgy|2005}} it was re–released for [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] and [[PlayStation 2]] as part of ''[[Capcom Classics Collection]]'', and again in ''[[Capcom Classics Collection: Reloaded]]'' on the PlayStation Portable. It also included as the initial game in ''Capcom Arcade Cabinet'', a compilation of games released digitally for [[PlayStation 3]] and [[Xbox 360]] on February 19, 2013 in which the games are sold individually or in packs. The overall faithfulness and quality of execution of these third party versions varies greatly.

===NES===
Released exactly one year after the arcade version, the NES version of ''1943'' introduced the ability to improve the player's plane by permanently upgrading certain aspects of its abilities. These include the plane's offensive and defensive powers, the maximum fuel level, and its special weapons and their durations. This somewhat alters the game balance and a different tactic is required to survive the game. For example, initially very few weapons are made available; more can be attained from power-ups by putting statistic points into "special weapons ability".&lt;ref&gt;This version does not bear a subtitle, though packaging gives the original Japanese release "The Battle of Valhalla" and the US release the normal "The Battle of Midway". Further, a Japan-bound prototype exists named ''1943: The Battle of Midway''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==''1943 Kai''==
Developed and released alongside the Family Computer version, {{nihongo|''1943 Kai: Midway Kaisen''|1943改 ミッドウェイ海戦}} is an arcade game, an "alternate" version of the original ''1943'', released in 1987&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arcade-museum.com/game_detail.php?game_id=6768 ''1943 Kai - Midway Kaisen ''] on '''arcade-museum.com'''&lt;/ref&gt; in Japan. In USA, it was released as ''1943: The Battle of Midway Mark II'' &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.arcade-history.com/?n=&amp;page=detail&amp;id=35748 ''1943 Mark II''] on '''arcade-history.com'''&lt;/ref&gt;. Most of the graphics and sounds have been reworked, and the game has been made more "extreme" (laser-firing World War II planes and ships that run on ground). Further, the trademark [[P-38 Lightning|P-38]] has been replaced with a [[Boeing-Stearman Model 75|Boeing Stearman E75 N68828]].

In 1991, this version was converted to the [[TurboGrafx-16|PC Engine]] as simply ''1943 Kai'', again exclusively in Japan; this version contains many additional levels and original music.

Although the arcade release was exclusive to Japan, the arcade version itself was included in the 1998 ''[[Capcom Generations]]'' for the Sega Saturn and the PlayStation and in the 2005 ''[[Capcom Classics Collection]]'' for [[PlayStation 2]] and [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]].

'''''American Cheerleader''''' is the first and largest national teen magazine dedicated to covering sideline and competitive cheerleading. It was founded in 1995 and is currently based in Memphis, Tennessee. Staff includes Editor-in-Chief Jackie Martin and Managing Editor Kim Conley.

==History==
Inspired by the popularity and competitive nature of cheerleading in the early 1990s, publishing executive Michael Weiskopf started a magazine to take advantage of its evolving culture. The first issue was published in New York in January 1995.

It was published by Lifestyle Ventures, LLC, and the first issue featured [[University of Maryland]] cheerleader Penny Ramsey, who went on to become a castaway in Thailand on the CBS show ''[[Survivor (U.S. TV series)|Survivor]]'' in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;"Penny Ramsey - IMDb." The Internet Movie Database (IMDb). Web. 20 Oct. 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Special Collector’s Editions were produced in February 2005 and February 2010 to commemorate the magazine’s 10th and 15th anniversaries. Lifestyle Media, Inc. was acquired by [[Macfadden Performing Arts Media]], LLC in 2006. [[Varsity Spirit]] bought the magazine in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foliomag.com/2012/american-cheerleader-sold-varsity-spirit-corp|title=American Cheerleader Sold to Varsity Spirit Corp.|publisher=|accessdate=10 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bizjournals.com/memphis/news/2012/01/23/varsity-spirit-corp-buys-american.html Varsity Spirit Corp. buys American Cheerleader magazine]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4003">'''Antilabe''' (from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]]: ἀντι "mutually" or "corresponding", λαβή, "grip" or "handle") is a [[rhetoric]]al technique in [[verse drama and dramatic verse|verse drama]] or [[closet drama]], in which a single [[Line (poetry)|verse line]] of dialogue is distributed on two or more [[Character (arts)|characters]], voices, or entities. The verse usually maintains its [[Metre (poetry)|metric]] integrity, while the line fragments spoken by the characters may or may not be complete sentences. In the layout of the text the line fragments following the first one are often indented ("[[dropped line]]") to show the unity of the verse line.

[[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]|[[Julius Caesar (play)|''Julius Caesar'']]}}

These are three sentences spoken by two persons. But it is only one single line in [[blank verse]]:

:Peace '''then'''. No '''words'''. I'll '''ra'''ther '''kill''' my'''self'''.

==In Ancient Greek drama==

"The device originated in [[tragedy|classical tragedy]] as a means of heightening dramatic tension."&lt;ref&gt;Eggenberger, David. ''McGraw-Hill Encyclopedia of World Drama''. Volume 1. 1972, p. 219.&lt;/ref&gt; "It figures in almost all the plays of [[Sophocles]] and [[Euripides]]. It renders dialogue less stately and more agitated: the technique is well suited to scenes of excitement, in which one speaker is repeatedly capping, countering or following up the ideas of another."&lt;ref&gt;Rutherford, R. B. ''Greek Tragic Style: Form, Language and Interpretation''. Cambridge University Press, 2012, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; In Sophokles’ ''[[Oedipus Rex|Oedipus]]'', for example, "as ''Kreon'' seizes ''Antigone'' (832), they break into an excited lyrical strophe, full of ''antilabe'' in which ''Oedipus'', ''Kreon'', and the chorus participate."&lt;ref&gt;Edmunds, Lowell. ''Theatrical Space and Historical Place in Sophocles' Oedipus at Colonus''. Maryland, Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 1996,  p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; "In ''[[Electra (Sophocles)|Electra]]'' (1502-3), ''antilabe'' occurs as ''Orestes'' tries to induce ''Aegisthys'' to enter the house so that ''Orestes'' can kill him."&lt;ref&gt;Thorburn, John E. Jr. ''The Facts on File Companion to Classical Drama''. Facts on File (Library of World Literature) 2005, p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; "[Antilabe is] used with particular freedom in late Euripides."&lt;ref&gt;Rutherford, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; "In the plays of [[Aeschylus]], with the possible exception of ''[[Prometheus Bound]]'' (line 980), this phenomenon does not occur." &lt;ref&gt;Thorburn, p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Seneca drama==

"Dialogic exchanges using both ''[[stichomythia]]'' and ''antilabe'' are common in [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]]. They occur in all the tragedies except ''Phoenissiae''."&lt;ref&gt;Boyle, A. J. ed. ''Seneca: Medea: Edited with Introduction, Translation, and Commentary''. Oxford University Press, 2014, p. 166.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Renaissance drama==

David Eggenberger notes that "[the device] was frequently utilized by [[Renaissance]] dramatists."&lt;ref&gt;Eggenberger, p. 219.&lt;/ref&gt;

An extreme example from Shakespeare is:

{{Quotation|Death?
::My lord?
::::A grave.
::::::He shall not live.|''[[The Life and Death of King John|King John]]'', 3.3}}

== Personal life ==
Louis was born in [[Phoenix, Arizona]] and grew up in [[Glendale, Arizona|Glendale]], Arizona where he attended Horizon Elementary, Landmark Middle School and then eventually [[Apollo High School (Arizona)|Apollo High School]]. While in high school, Louis began filming the "Ari Louis Show" with his friend Matt Turley and cameraman "Gus McDanny," who was actually his brother, Danny Louis, a musician living in Israel.&lt;ref&gt;http://dannylouis.bandcamp.com&lt;/ref&gt; The show was modeled after the [[Conan O'Brien]] show.
Louis attended [[Arizona State University]] in 2001 and studied online at the [[Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication]], eventually graduating with a degree in Religious Studies. Louis suffered a great deal of anti-Semitism and as a result focused much of his attention in college to Judaism and Zionism.

While in college, Louis founded the ''Chabad'' at Arizona State University and was the Vice-President of ''ASU for Israel''. During this time, Louis filmed his first broadcast television show ''Louis Live'' on a public access station in [[Tucson, Arizona]].

Louis graduated in 2003 and worked as a teacher.

== Israeli Broadcasting Career ==
In 2008, Louis moved to Israel, although he figured his broadcasting career was over, his Zionist dream helped propel him to move. However, Louis's broadcasting career was not over. In 2009 he teamed up with Andrew Gershman to host a talk-show on the Jerusalem-based station [[Rusty Mike Radio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/Sports/The-dream-of-sports-radio-is-finally-coming-to-Israel|title=The dream of sports radio is finally coming to Israel|website=The Jerusalem Post {{!}} JPost.com|access-date=2016-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Entitled the ''Andy and Ari Show,'' they discussed American sports, becoming the highest rated show on the station.

Louis and Gershman were approached by Joshua Halickman "the Sports Rabbi"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sportsrabbi.com/|title=Sports Rabbi {{!}} The Leading Source For Israeli Sports|website=sportsrabbi.com|access-date=2016-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; to start ''Israel Sports Radio in'' summer of 2010 to much fanfare.&lt;ref&gt;[[Israel Sports Radio]]{{Better source|date=October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3962255,00.html|title=Israel Sports Radio to launch Monday|access-date=2016-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/Radio/News.aspx/2590#.V7KnY_l97IU|title=Can a Sports Radio Station Work in Israel? - Radio - Arutz Sheva|website=Arutz Sheva|access-date=2016-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/sports-talk-radio-station-to-debut-today-1.317021|title=Sports talk radio station to debut today|website=Haaretz.com|access-date=2016-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vosizneias.com/65329|title=Jerusalem - All-sports Talk Radio Debuts in Israel|website=VosIzNeias|access-date=2016-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ari Louis with Al Michaels.jpg|thumb|Ari Louis (right) with legendary broadcaster [[Al Michaels]].]]
After becoming an owner at the age of 28, Louis's legend grew throughout Israel, with Sirius and Fox courting him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/Sports/Israel-Sports-Radio-set-to-expand-its-reach|title=Israel Sports Radio set to expand its reach|website=The Jerusalem Post {{!}} JPost.com|access-date=2016-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Louis chose to remain in Israel rather than relocate.

In 2013, Louis was approached by TLV1.fm, a Tel-Aviv based internet radio station to broadcast ''Louis Live Sports'', which he hosted for two years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://tlv1.fm/content/louis-live-sports/|title=Louis Live Sports Archives - TLV1 RADIO|website=TLV1 RADIO|language=en-US|access-date=2016-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later that year, Louis was approached by [[Arutz Sheva]] - Israel National News where he hosted ''Is It Prophesy?,'' a call-in talk show that compared contemporary headlines with Biblical verses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/Radio/Author.aspx/13067|title=About Ari Louis - Radio - Arutz Sheva|website=Arutz Sheva|access-date=2016-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Guests included Rabbi David Katz, Rabbi Ken Spiro and others.

Since 2013 Louis has been writing a blog for the [[The Times of Israel|Times of Israel]] which focuses on both sports and politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blogs.timesofisrael.com/author/ari-louis/|title=Ari Louis {{!}} The Blogs {{!}} The Times of Israel|website=The Times of Israel|access-date=2016-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 and 2015 Louis organized and hosted the Jerusalem Festivus Comedy Festival. Proceeds went to charity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/events/734874583253567/|title=The Jerusalem Festivus Comedy Festival|website=www.facebook.com|access-date=2016-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/events/1015088715218947/|title=The 2nd Annual Jerusalem Festivus Comedy Festival|website=www.facebook.com|access-date=2016-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=jfeldhamer|title=The 2nd Annual Jerusalem Festivus Comedy Festival Teaser Trailer - v3|date=2015-12-14|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ezPHXSdXA|accessdate=2016-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the summer of 2015, Louis inaugurated the new venture ''Israel Sports and News Radio''.

The [[card game]] of '''Bauernschnapsen''' (also called ''Viererschnapsen'') is an expanded form of the popular Austrian [[card game]] of [[Schnapsen]], played by four players. This variant of Schnapsen is played throughout the whole of Austria.

== General rules ==

Bauernschnapsen is played with a 20-card packet of Schnapsen cards by two teams of two, the partners sitting opposite one another across the [[card table]].&lt;ref name="pagat"&gt; {{cite web|title=Bauernschnapsen|periodical=pagat.com|publisher=John McLeod|url=https://www.pagat.com/de/marriage/bauernschnapsen.html|deadurl=|format=HTML|accessdate=2017-11-08|archiveurl=|archivedate=|last=Hans-Joachim Alscher|date=2012-10-08|year=|month=|day=|language=German|pages=7|quote=}} &lt;/ref&gt; Team membership may be renounced, but none of the players may use their experience of which cards their partner has in their hand, and they also do not known which cards he has. The aim is to win 24&amp;nbsp;points and the game ends as soon as one team has achieved that. In regional variants, scores start at 24&amp;nbsp;and count down to null (zero) points and the team that reaches null first is the winner. the losing team receives a ''Bummerl''. If the losing team scores no points, it receives a ''[[Schneider (cards)|Schneider]]'', which counts as two ''Bummerls''. If a team leads 23:0 and loses it receives a ''Retourschneider'' (or ''Schuster'', ''Rücker''), which counts as four ''Bummerls''. Another rule is that the first trick of each team must remain visible to all the players for the whole game, irrespective of the type of game being played.

=== Cards ===

The same cards are used as for other variants of Schnapsen: either [[French suited cards|French suited]] or [[German suited cards]] ([[William Tell pattern]]). There are 4 [[Suit (cards)|suits]]: in French [[playing card]]s and ''doppeldeutsche'' (William Tell pattern) cards they are [[Hearts (card suit)|Hearts]] (''Herz''), [[Diamonds (card suit)|Diamonds]] (''Karo''), [[Spades (card suit)|Spades]] (''Pik'') and [[Clubs (card suit)|Clubs]] (''Kreuz'' or, regionally, ''Treff''). In the ''doppeldeutsche'' variants the suits are regionally also known as Hearts (''Herz''), [[Bells (card suit)|Bells]] (''Schelle''), [[Leaves (card suit)|Leaves]] (''Blatt'', ''Grün'' or ''Laub'')  and [[Acorns (card suit)|Acorns]] (''Eichel''). There are five different cards per suit:

In each suit there are five cards: the Ace (''Ass'') (regionally the Deuce or ''Daus''), the 10, the King, the Ober (or the ''Dame'', regionally ''Manderl'') and the Unter (or the ''Bube'', regional ''Bauer'').&lt;ref name="panda"&gt; {{cite web|title=Schnapsen - Bauernschnapsen - Spielregeln|periodical=panda.pytalhost.at|publisher=panda.pytalhost.at|url=http://www.panda.pytalhost.at/|deadurl=|format=HTML|accessdate=2017-11-07|archiveurl=|archivedate=|last=panda.pytalhost.at|date=2017|year=|month=|day=|language=German|pages=11|quote=}} &lt;/ref&gt;

=== Start and finish ===
The dealer [[shuffles]] the [[Playing card|card deck]] and the player to his right [[cut (cards)|cuts]] the deck at least once or 'knocks' with his fist on the deck to indicate he is happy not to cut. Next three cards are dealt to each player in clockwise order, beginning with the player on the dealer's left, the caller (''Rufer''). The caller must choose a [[trump suit]] (''Trumpffarbe'' or, regionally, ''Atoutfarbe'') from his first three cards, before receiving the remaining two cards. Then each player is dealt a packet of two more cards in the same order. If the caller cannot or will not decided which suit will be trumps, he can draw one of the two remaining cards and turn it over for everyone to see; the suit of this card is then the trump suit. If the player right of the dealer has knocked on the card deck, each player is given all five cards at once in the same clockwise order. The caller is initially dealt three, in order to decide the trump suit, and then a further two.&lt;ref name="pagat"/&gt;

The trump suit beats all other cards in most cases. If the first three cards that the caller is dealt consists of three ''Unters'' (regionally ''Buben'' or ''Bauern''), he may insist that the cards are reshuffled and redealt.

After the caller has called trumps, the player who has bid the highest contract, may play it. In one regional variant, the caller must first decide whether to bid a contract or to pass; in the latter case the next player to the left (clockwise) has the right to bid a contract or pass.

In several contracts that may be declared, the declared trump suit becomes irrelevant and all suits are deemed equal in rank. Within a suit, the higher card beats the lower, and only cards of the trump suit may beat cards of a different suit. If a player e.g. plays an Unter of Leaves, a King or a Deuce (Ace) of another colour cannot beat it, but only be discarded (''zugegeben'') – with the exception of the trump suit if trumps are valid.

At the end of each hand the caller becomes the dealer; he shuffles, lets the player to the right cut or knock and deals the cards as described above.

Which special contracts are permitted, varies to some extent from region to region. It is common to have the Schnapser, the Gang (or ''Gangl'') and the Bauernschnapser (''Bauer''). The ''Bettler'' contracts are very controversial in conservative circles, because they make normal games the exception rather than the rule.

== Contracts ==
=== Normal game ===
If no contract is bid, a 'normal game' (''normales Spiel'') is played, sometimes called a ''Rufer''&lt;ref name="panda" /&gt; ('caller'), whereby the caller plays the first card. The aim is, together with one's partner, to score 66 card points or to win the last trick. If the losing team does not win a single trick, the winning team scores 3 game points. If the losing team score fewer than 33 points, the winning team gets 2 game points. If the losing team scores 33 or more, the winning team just gets one game point.

In Bauernschnapsen players must follow suit and attempt to win the trick, as in ''Zweierschnapsen'', once the [[talon (cards)|talon]] has been used up or after it has been closed (''zugedreht''):
# If a player has a higher card of the same suit, it must be played. If that is not possible,
# a lower card of the same suit must be played. If that is not possible,
# a trump must be played. If that is not possible,
# any card may be discarded.

The player who wins the trick must lead to the next trick unless his team won the game as a result of winning the trick.&lt;ref name="panda" /&gt;

If a player, whose turn it is, has a King and an Ober (regionally ''Mandl'' or ''Ober'') of the same suit, he may declare a ''Zwanziger'' ("Twenty-er"), which wins 20 points. If the King and Ober are of the trump suit, he may declare a ''Vierziger'' ("Forty-er") and win 40&amp;nbsp;points. One of the two cards must be played, usually the Ober is chosen. They must win the trick when they can. If the team gets no tricks in the same game, the Twenty-ers and Forty-ers do not count. If the team wins at least one trick, the Twenty-ers and Forty-ers count even if the tricks were won by the other team.

=== Bettler (or Fechter) ===
The aim of Bettler ("Beggar") or, regionally, Fechter ("Swordsman") is not to take any tricks. All suits are equal. As in all the contracts, players must follow suit and try to win the trick. In one regional variant the partner of the player who has announced Bettler is not allowed to play and must take a pause. The winning team scores 4 points.&lt;ref name="panda" /&gt;

=== Schnapser (or Drei-Stich) ===
In Schnapser or Drei-Stich ("Three Trick") only the caller can declare and he must play the first card. If anyone beats his card, the team loses. If his own partner beats the caller's card, the game is also lost. The game is won in one of the following ways:

# The caller must achieve 66 points in the first 3 tricks.
# The caller must take exactly one trick and then announce a Forty-er (''Vierziger'') to achieve 66&amp;nbsp;points.
# The caller must take exactly two tricks and then announce a Twenty-er (''Zwanziger'') to achieve 66&amp;nbsp;points.

The caller does not have to decide which of these options to go for before the start of the Schnapser game, but just says "I'll play a Schnapser" (''Ich spiele einen Schnapser'').

There is an uncommon regional variant in which the partner is allowed to win a trick, known as ''Schnapser mit Mann''. The winning team scores 6 points.&lt;ref name="panda" /&gt;

=== Gangl (Ring or Land) ===
A Gang (regionally ''Gangl'', ''Durchmarsch'', ''Land'', ''Ringerl'', ''Ring'' or ''Neuner'') may be announced by any player. All suits are the same value. The aim is to take all the tricks. The one who declares Gang plays the first card. If the declarer's partner takes a trick the game is lost. The winning team gets 9 points.&lt;ref name="panda" /&gt;

=== Bauernschnapser ===
As in Gang the aim is to take all the tricks. Unlike Gang, however, the trump suit announced by the caller counts, so it is difficult for players other than the caller to declare this contract. The winning team scores 12&amp;nbsp;points.&lt;ref name="panda" /&gt;

=== Kontraschnapser (or Kontra-Drei-Stich) ===
The Kontraschnapser ("Counter-Schnapser") or Kontra-Drei-Stich ("Counter-Three Tricks") can be played by an opponent of the caller. The trump suit declared by the caller counts, the caller starts and the declarer must win the game.

The game may be won in the following ways:
# The declarer must win 66&amp;nbsp;points in the first 3 tricks.
# The declarer must win exactly one trick and then announce a Forty-er (''Vierziger'') to achieve 66&amp;nbsp;points.
# The caller must take exactly two tricks and then announce a Twenty-er (''Zwanziger'') to achieve 66&amp;nbsp;points.

The winning team scores 12&amp;nbsp;points.&lt;ref name="panda" /&gt; 
In a regional variant the caller's partner can announce "Schnapser together" (''Schnapser zusammen'') which may win 6&amp;nbsp;points.

=== Farbringerl (or Farbenjodler, Herrenringerl) ===
Farbringerl is also called Herrengangl or Farbensolo. If a player has all five cards of one suit, he may declare Farbringerl. Atout does not apply. It earns exactly 18 points.
Because this game is won (or lost) by declaring, even though it is impossible that the opposing players could beat them, it is usual that the game is won by placing the cards on the table. Because this special contract, as explained, cannot be played out, many clubs exclude this contract from their 'contract catalogue for 4-player Bauernschnapsen.

=== Kontrabauernschnapser ===
Kontrabauernschnapser is similar to Bauernschnapser: the aim is to take all the tricks, the trump suit being named by the caller. The caller plays the first card and the declarer must win all the tricks.
The winning team scores 24&amp;nbsp;points; thus the game is ended by a Kontrabauernschnapser.&lt;ref name="panda" /&gt;

=== Herrenschnapser (or Herrenjodler, Trumpffarbenringerl) ===
If the caller holds all the cards of the ''Atout'' suit, he may declare a Herrenschnapser. This game counts for 24 points. Like Farbenring this special contract cannot be played out. As a result many clubs exclude it from their 'contract catalogue for 4-player Bauernschnapsen.

=== Flecken (or Spritzen, Schießen) ===
If the opposing team believes that the declarer will lose the game, they  can double the stakes (known as ''spritzen'' or, regionally, ''flecken'', ''schießen'' or ''kontern''). The contract is then worth double points. With the announcement ''Retour'' or ''[[Kontra (cards)|Kontra]]'' or ''Zruckgspritzt'' the player (or his partner) may double it again, if he is nevertheless sure that they can win the game. This can be responded to again with the declaration ''Re'' or ''nuamoi zruckgspritzt'', whereupon a win would bring eight times the actual number of points - but this kind of thing does not happen very often. Every contract can be ''gefleckt'', both normal ones as well as special contracts.&lt;ref name="panda" /&gt;

If the team that is leading could reach zero, their opponents will often call ''"auf Stand"'', regardless of the quality of their own hands. They do this because doubling makes no difference if the team loses, but if they are lucky it may increase their chances of winning.

=== Special regional contracts ===

==== Assenbettler (Zehnerloch) ====
As in Bettler the aim of Assenbettler (regionally ''Zehnerloch''), is not to take any tricks, all suits having the same value. As in all other contracts, it is compulsory to follow suit and win the trick if possible. The ace/deuce becomes the lowest card, so that the sequence is: 10, King, Ober, Unter, Ace/Deuce. The winning team scores five points.

==== Ass-Bettler (or Ass-Fechter) ====
As in Bettler and Assenbettler the aim of Ass-Bettler (regionally ''Ass-Fechter'') is not to take any tricks, all suits being equal in value. As in all other contracts, it is compulsory to follow suit and win the trick if possible. The player who announces Ass-Bettler must have at least one ace in his hand which makes it more difficult for him not to take a trick. The team that wins Ass-Bettler scores five points.

==== Plauderer ====
There is no special contract in Bauernschnapsen that is played so differently from round to round  and from region to region as Plauderer.

(a) Like Bettler/Fechter, where the opposing players may team up before the first game (they may look at each others' the cards). If the player succeeds in not taking a single trick, the team receives 7 points.

(b) Like Bettler/Fechter, with the opposing players laying their cards face up in front of them after the first trick and the game being continued without the players communicating with each other.

(c) Like Bettler/Fechter, with the declarer laying his cards face up in front of him after the first trick, but the opposing players keeping their cards hidden and continuing the game without the players communicating with each other.

==== Zehnergang (or Zehnerloch, Zehnerhittn, Zehnerland) ====
As in Gang, the goal is to take all the tricks, all suits being equal. The ace is the lowest card, so the order of rank is: Tens, King, Ober, Unter, Ace. Zehnergang is not always an option in all areas and is therefore one of the special regional contracts in Bauernschnapsen. Therefore it should be clarified before the beginning of the game whether Zehnergang is allowed. There are two regional differences:

# If Gang (9&amp;nbsp;points) and Zehnergang (ten&amp;nbsp;points) are announced, Gang is played.
# If Gang (9&amp;nbsp;points) and Zehnergang (ten&amp;nbsp;points) are announced, Zehnergang is played.

The winning team scores 10 points.&lt;ref name="panda" /&gt;

==== Bauernloch ====
Bauernloch is a combination of Bauernschnapsen and Zehnerloch (or Zehnerloch, Zehnerhitten, Zehnerland). As in Zehnergang, the aim is to win all the tricks, but the exception that invalidates the trump is not used. Like Bauernschnapsen, trump cards keep their higher position. The increased difficulty of this contract is reflected in the points. Bauernloch can only be played by the person who chose the trump suit. He must take all the tricks and, if successful, wins 12 points.

== Talonschnapsen (3 players) ==

{{main|Dreierschnapsen}}

Talonschnapsen is also called Dreierschnapsen. The basic rules are the same as Bauernschnapsen, but there are only 3 players and thus it is a 'cut throat' game rather than a partnership game. Each player has a hand of 6, not 5, cards, the two remaining cards form the [[talon (cards)|talon]].

The dealer deals 3 cards to each player; the forehand, left of the dealer, calls the Atout, then 2 cards are placed face down as a talon (hence the name), then a further 3 cards are dealt to each player.

The bidding of a contract is as in normal Bauernschnapsen, beginning with the caller of the Atout. The player who bids the highest contract may now pick up the talon and must replace two cards again. If no-one bids a contract, a normal game is played, as described above, in which case the caller may look at the talon and, if he wants, exchange the talon cards for two of his own. Either way, the cards remain face down on the table.

In addition to the possibility to raise the originally announced game, there are two rules, which are handled differently regionally and which should therefore be clarified before the game starts. First, the caller (who announced a contract first) can raise it again before picking up the talon, if one of his teammates has bid a higher contract than his. Example: Caller (player A) bids a Schnapser, B passes, but C bids a higher contract. A hopes that the "right" cards are in the talon - and now raises to a Bauernschnapser. The other rule, which is not generally valid, refers to raising after picking up the hand: one of the players has "prevailed" with his contract, looks at the talon and thus gets a hand that allows him a higher contract, so now he announces this contract (before playing the first card, of course!). If a normal game is played, the caller could announce another contract in this case.

If the talon is not needed, you can also play without talon cards. When two players call out a contract, the player who can play without the talon cards has the precedence.

Whoever then plays his announcement must now win his game against the other two.

Points: If the player finishes his declared game, he alone gets the points, if he doesn't win, each of the other two get the points. The game also ends here at 24 points. There is always a "Bummerl" or "Schneider", who has the fewest points of the three, if two players have the same number of points, both have a "Bummerl" or "Schneider".
Regional variant: Any player who does not reach 24 points has a "Bummerl" - this can even happen if you win a game with your partner.
Flecken is also possible in Talonschnapsen: a "flecken", "spritzen" or "schießen" may not be rescinded one it has been announced. It can be announced until the first card has been played, regardless of whether the talon has been viewed or not!
In a normal game, the caller must win at least 66 points; the talon cards are not counted along with the tricks he has won.

The announced contracts do not differ except for the Schnapser and Farbenring from those of the 4-player or Bauernschnapsen. Schnapser in Talonschnapsen consists of 4 tricks, in order to win the 12 cards, which can also be achieved in Bauernschnapsen. In double games, the talon is given to the person calling the figure, the atout caller leads and plays against the figure with the third player. In Farbenring, the player has all 5 cards of a certain suit and must make all 6 tricks.

It is a collaboration between Koei Tecmo's ''[[Dynasty Warriors]]'' video game series and [[Kentaro Miura]]'s ''[[Berserk (manga)|Berserk]]'' manga series. ''Berserk and the Band of the Hawk'' was released for PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita, as well as PlayStation 3 in Japan on October 27, 2016, and was released for Microsoft Windows internationally in February 2017.&lt;ref name="Announcement"/&gt;

==Gameplay==
''Berserk and the Band of the Hawk'' mixes the [[Hack and slash|hack-and-slash]] gameplay of [[Koei Tecmo]]'s ''[[Dynasty Warriors]]'' series of video games, with the setting and characters from the ''Berserk'' manga series by [[Kentaro Miura]].

==Plot==
The game follows the story of the manga series, starting in the Golden Age Arc and ending in the Hawk of the Millennium Empire Arc.

==Development==
''Berserk and the Band of the Hawk'' was first revealed in a short promotion video by Koei Tecmo on June 12, 2016, prior to [[Electronic Entertainment Expo 2016]]. A release for PlayStation 4, PlayStation Vita, as well as PlayStation 3 in Japan and Microsoft Windows in western territories, were confirmed. A week later, on June 20, a flyer was sent out in Japan, which confirmed a September 21 release in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gematsu.com/2016/06/koei-tecmos-berserk-launches-september-21-japan|title=Koei Tecmo's Berserk launches September 21 in Japan|work=Gematsu|author=Sal Romano|date=2016-06-20|accessdate=2016-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview, producer Hisashi Koinuma ensured fans that the team aims for a [[Computer Entertainment Rating Organization#Rating|CERO D]] rating for the game in Japan and will do anything to avoid a [[Computer Entertainment Rating Organization#Rating|CERO Z]] rating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamer.ne.jp/news/201606200069/|title=【E3 2016】史上最凶の無双が登場！謎に満ちた「ベルセルク無双」について鯉沼久史プロデューサーにインタビュー|work=Gamer|date=2016-06-20|accessdate=2016-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Z rating is the equivalent of the "Adults Only" rating by the North American board [[Entertainment Software Rating Board#Ratings|ESRB]]. On July 15, 2016, Koei Tecmo revealed that the western version of the game was planned to release in Fall 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.destructoid.com/the-berserk-warriors-game-will-launch-this-year-in-the-west-375250.phtml|title=The Berserk Warriors game will launch this year in the west|work=Destructoid|date=2016-07-15|accessdate=2016-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, when the game's official localized name was revealed, Koei Tecmo announced new release dates, being February 21, 2017 for North America and February 24, 2017 for Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gematsu.com/2016/09/berserk-band-hawk-launches-february-21-north-america-february-24-europe|title=Berserk and the Band of the Hawk launches February 21 in North America, February 24 in Europe|work=Gematsu|date=2016-09-15|accessdate=2016-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Beyond Shadowgate''''' is a [[TurboGrafx CD]] sequel to the 1987 [[Apple Macintosh|Mac]] and [[MacVenture]] ''[[Shadowgate]]''. Unlike its predecessor, ''Beyond Shadowgate'' is a classical [[point-and-click]] [[adventure game|adventure]] viewed from a [[platform game|platform]] [[perspective (visual)|perspective]]. The player controls Prince Erik, the descendant of the hero from the first game, [[Lord Jair]]. When Prince Erik returns to his home country, he finds out about his father's murder. The Prince is framed by the minister of the late king, who imprisons him where the adventure starts.

A 14 by 19 inch poster by veteran [[role-playing game]] artist [[Jim Holloway (artist)|Jim Holloway]], who also created the game's opening and closing animation sequences, was folded inside the jewel case for the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=At the Deadline|magazine=[[GamePro]]|issue=64|publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=January 1994|page=260}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gameplay==
As in ''[[Shadowgate]]'', the player must solve a series of puzzles throughout the castle in order to proceed to the end of the game. Prince Erik can move around, examine, manipulate, and take objects. Commands also allow ducking and [[punch (strike)|punching]]. Traps and puzzles may cause the death of the character if they are not correctly solved.

==Reception==
''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'' gave the game a 7.5 out of 10. They criticized the slow pacing but praised the eerie mood, the graphics, the intellectually stimulating puzzles, and the ability to interact with nearly every item in the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=Beyond Shadowgate Review|magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=53|publisher=Sendai Publishing|date=December 1993|page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[GamePro]]'' called ''Beyond Shadowgate'' "an enticing action/adventure RPG that combines the intricate puzzles of the original ''[[Shadowgate]]'' with a new graphic 3D environment." They also expressed approval for the realistic level of sound effects and the multiple routes through the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=Beyond Shadowgate|magazine=[[GamePro]]|issue=64|publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=January 1994|page=255}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
''Blackout! 2'' was  announced in 2007 by Redman and was originally scheduled for release in 2008, but its release was pushed back a number of times due to numerous reasons. It was finally released on May 19, 2009. It was released on the same days as [[Eminem]]'s sixth studio album ''[[Relapse (Eminem album)|Relapse]]'' and [[Busta Rhymes]]'s eighth studio album ''[[Back on My B.S.]]''.  After touring on the Still High Tour with [[Termanology]], [[The Alchemist (producer)|The Alchemist]], [[Havoc (Mobb Deep)|Havoc]] (from [[Mobb Deep]]), and [[Evidence (musician)|Evidence]], [[Redman (rapper)|Redman]] and [[Method Man]] finished and set the release date for their highly anticipated sequel.

Method Man stated the reasons for the delay:{{cquote|I had obligations. Doc had obligations. There were things going on with the label. Staff changes. That's what happened.}} Giving his take on the delay, Redman stated: {{cquote|We was out venturing, starting other careers," Red said. "We can't just depend on this rap game. We did a movie, TV show&amp;nbsp;— venturing out. Now we back. We ain't left. We're coming at the right time.}}&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Reid |first=Shaheem |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1608980/20090409/method_man.jhtml |title=Method Man, Redman Return With Blackout 2 After 'Venturing' Out - News Story &amp;#124; Music, Celebrity, Artist News &amp;#124; MTV News |publisher=Mtv.com |date=2009-04-10 |accessdate=2010-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Redman stated about the album's production process to MTV: {{cquote|We're more advanced now than the first one, Red added.

We went in, had fun. I have my own studio now, so it's more relaxed. I engineer now. It ain't no rush for time, paying the studio and engineer. It's fun. We treated [the album] like a mixtape, really. If we really got in there and sat, it'll be a beast. But it's a beast now, and we treated it like a mixtape.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;}}

Reviews of the album were generally positive. It has a score of 79 out of an overall score of 100 on [[Metacritic]], which stated that the album is overall a "Generally favorable reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/music/artists/methodmanandredman/blackout2 |title=Blackout! 2 reviews at |publisher=Metacritic.com |date=2009-05-19 |accessdate=2010-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Allmusic.com gave it a four out of five stars stating that: {{cquote|With each having individual obligations all over the place, it took ten years for Method Man and Redman to record a follow-up to 1999's beloved [[Blackout! (Method Man &amp; Redman album)|Blackout!]], but one listen and you'd think it had only been ten days. Interplay during the intro proves that none of the chemistry is lost." and "The original deserves the top spot, but think of this as the Godfather Part II of reckless boom-bap rap and you've got an idea of how well this Blackout!}}

HiphopDX.com gave the album a 3.5 stars out of 5, stating that: {{cquote|Still, Red and Meth clearly made this album for the fans, and the fans should be more or less sated. They may not be as ferocious as they once were, but very few ever have been. So with that in mind, Blackout! 2 is definitely worth a spin&amp;nbsp;– and not just for nostalgia’s sake.}}

Vibe gave a favorable review, stating that: {{cquote|The middle-aged MCs have forged an album that reflects their belief that skills will always trump bells and whistles. Don’t mistake it for complacency--blame it on consistency. BO2 passes the smell test.}}

Billboard also gave it a favorable review which stated: {{cquote|This dynamic duo comes off as vital as it has in a decade on the highly anticipated sequel to the pair's 1999 collaborative debut, "Blackout!}}

IGN.com gave the album an 8/10 stated that: {{cquote|For the most part, Blackout! 2 is a decent rap experience, with strong beats and music, masterful emcee braggadocio and funky flow, and a playful pothead sense of humor. Nothing amazes or stands out as awful; but Meth &amp; Red fans should be satisfied.}}

XXL gave the album a mixed review, giving the album a grade of L out of XXL, stating that: {{cquote|For the majority of Blackout! 2, Meth and Red touch upon the strongest staples of their past work (“Four Minutes to Lock Down,” with Raekwon and Ghostface, is this album’s always reliable Wu-Tang cipher). The uninspired filler that litters this reunion’s latter portion, though, spoils the overall taste. Those with a hardcore case of the munchies for vintage Meth and Red goodness should feel satisfied. Just expect to be reminded more of past, stronger highs, rather than any lasting, in-the-moment buzz.}}

The Children's Discovery System used a 16-by-48 matrix [[liquid-crystal display|LCD]] screen&lt;ref name=ggdb01&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ggdb.com/GameByName.aspx?c=Handheld&amp;s=Other&amp;l=C&amp;vid=6592 |title=The Great Game Database - Mattel Children's Discovery System |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711092209/http://www.ggdb.com/GameByName.aspx?c=Handheld&amp;s=Other&amp;l=C&amp;vid=6592 |archivedate=2011-07-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and was powered by six size [[AA battery|AA]] [[alkaline battery|alkaline batteries]].&lt;ref name=comphist-cds&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.computerhistory.org/collections/accession/102630217 |title=Computer History Museum - The Children's Discovery System computerized learning system}}&lt;/ref&gt; The screen was much wider than it was tall, therefore only a grid of 8-by-2 text was possible, allowing for a maximum of 16 characters on-screen at any given moment.

The unit came preprogrammed with three modes: Art mode, Music mode and Type mode. The Discovery System came with a specially laid-out [[membrane keyboard]] to better accommodate the built-in modes and also made use of keyboard overlays for use with expansion modules. Also included with the unit was a large activity book with over 100 suggested learning activities specially-tailored for the Discovery System.&lt;ref name=hhgm01b&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.handheldmuseum.com/Mattel/Mattel1981/Mattel1981-10.jpg |title=Handheld Game Museum - Children's Discovery System (Mattel 1981 catalog)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Crossovers''' are classic moves from [[Balboa (dance)]].

The pattern is back - together - forward with a quick - quick - slow rhythm,
or the down-hold rhythm.

''Lead:''
#  - Step back left 45 degrees with left foot, leaving follow behind (allow arms to extend)
#  - Step back with right foot, bringing feet together.
#  - Step forward with left foot, crossing it over right foot, and bring follow back into original position.
#  - Hold.
#  - Step back right 45 degrees with right foot, leaving follow behind (allow arms to extend).
#  - Step back with left foot, bringing feet together.
#  - Step forward with right foot, crossing it over left foot, and bring follow back into original position.
#  - Hold.

Crossovers can be done where both are going to the same side, or they are alternating.

Crossovers also include swivels and fall off the log.

'''Dance position''' is a [[human position|position]] of a dancer or a mutual position of a dance couple assumed during a [[dance]]. Describing and mastering proper dance positions is an important part of dance technique.

These dance positions of a single dancer may be further detailed into body, head, arm, hand, leg, and foot positions; also, these positions in a dance couple can additionally take into account [[connection (dance)|connection]], relative orientation of partners, and directions of movement (or of movement intention).

In [[ballet]], the term "pose" is used to describe stationary dance positions; the most important are referred to as "first position" through to "fifth position." Following are the descriptions to all five major ballet positions:

==Five basic foot positions==

# First position: This is the main ballet position, and for most beginners the basic positions you will start from. Your feet should be turned out only as far as is comfortable for you. You should feel completely balanced in this position and the entire sole of your foot and toes are in contact with the floor. Make sure to not have your feet rolling forward and that your turn out is uncomfortable or where you are going to fall over. Do not try to get them in a completely straight line á la Charlie Chaplin, until you have much training and built up flexibility! Also, notice how your heels probably won't touch just try to get them as close as you can while still being comfortable.
# Second position: From first position slide one foot away from the other. You should have a space of about one and a half of your feet length between both feet. Make sure to keep your feet turned out similar to that of first position.
# Third position: Now slide your foot back to touch the other, but instead of touching heels together as in first position, this time bring one foot further across the other. Your heel should be touching the arch of your other foot. Third position will probably be the start to most of your barre exercises as a beginner, so take a little time to find and get used to this position.
# Fourth position: From the third position slide your front foot directly out in front of you. The distance between your two feet should be about exactly one of your feet. 
# Fifth position: From fourth position slide your front foot directly back towards you. Bring your front foot slightly further across your back foot than in third position. When your feet touch, your front toe should be roughly in front of your back heel. The 'ideal' position is to get your front foot to cover your back foot. You should be so turned out that you are standing toe to heel, both front heel to back toe and front toe to back heel. To execute this perfectly takes years of training; for the time being, position yourself so you are comfortable.

==Five basic arm positions==

# First position: You should look as if you were holding a beach ball that is too big for your arms. As you get this position you should have about a foot's distance between your curved arms. Once in this position lower your arms to have about an inch or two inches from your abdomen. 
# Second position: Your arms should be a straight line with your arms extended out from your sides. Keep your elbows facing back, and keep your arms relaxed. 
# Third position: From second position keep one arm out straight and bring the other one in as if you are holding part of the beach ball we mentioned earlier.
# Forth position: From third position, again keep your one arm straight and raise the arm that's holding the beach ball above your head. 
# Fifth position: This position is similar to first position, other than your arms should be above your head. Keep your arms as if they are holding a beach ball.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Five Basic Ballet Positions|url=http://www.danceclass.com/ballet-positions.html|website=DanceClass.com|accessdate=29 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Refimprove|date=September 2018}}

==Body positions==

# Arabesque: A position of the body in which you are on one leg with the other leg raised behind the body and extended in a straight line. 
# Attitude: A position of the body in which is a variation of the arabesque. In this position your extended leg is raised behind the body but bent at the knee at an angle of 90 degrees.
# Assemblé: A jump in which you leave the ground on one leg, and land on two. Your legs come togetherat the same time and return to fifth position.
# Grande Jeté: A big jump from one foot to the other; this is where one foot brushes of the ground and seems to look as if it was thrown.
# Plié: Bending of the knee or knees.
# Turn-out: The dancer turns his or her feet and legs out from the hip joints; your feet positions.
# Pirouette: A spin or turn- a complete turn of the body on one foot, on point or demi-pointe (half- pointe), in which on leg is lifted in pique, or where your one foot is connected to the knee by your toe and the knee is pointed out to the side.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nedvigin|first1=Gennadi|title=Ballet Terms and Positions|url=https://www.atlantaballet.com/resources/ballet-terms-and-positions|website=Atlanta Ballet|accessdate=29 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Death Rattle''''' was an [[United States|American]] black-and-white [[horror comics|horror]] anthology [[comic book]] series published in three volumes by [[Kitchen Sink Press]] in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s. ''Death Rattle'' is not related to the Australian one-shot comic ''Death Rattle'', published by Gredown in c. 1983.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comics.org/issue/805819/ "''Death Rattle'' (Predawn),"] Grand Comics Database. Accessed Oct. 23, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting out as an [[underground comix]] homage to classic horror comics like ''[[Tales from the Crypt (comics)|Tales from the Crypt]]'',&lt;ref name=Sabin&gt;Sabin, Roger (1996). "Going underground". ''Comics, Comix &amp; Graphic Novels: A History Of Comic Art''. London, United Kingdom: Phaidon Press. pp. 92; 94–95; 103–107; 110; 111; 116; 119; 124–126; 128. {{ISBN|0-7148-3008-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Fox /&gt; ''Death Rattle'' did not fall under the purview of the [[Comics Code]], allowing the title to feature stronger content — such as profanity, nudity, and graphic violence — than other comparable horror titles.&lt;ref name=Fox&gt;Fox, M. Steven. [http://comixjoint.com/deathrattle-v1.html "Death Rattle, Volume 1,"] ComixJoint. Accessed Oct. 23, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publication history==
''Death Rattle'' volume 1 was published from June 1972–June 1973 under the [[Krupp Comic Works]] imprint, putting out three issues in all.

Twelve years later, ''Death Rattle'' was revived for volume 2, publishing 18 issues between October 1985–October 1988 under the [[Kitchen Sink Comix]] imprint. The first five issues were in full color, but for issue #6 onwards the title reverted to black-and-white.

''Death Rattle'' volume 3 ran five issues from Dec. 1995–June 1996, again under the Kitchen Sink Comix imprint.

== ''Death Rattle'' Vol. 1 ==
The early 1970s saw a number of underground publishers putting out horror comics, from the [[San Francisco Comic Book Company]]'s  ''Bogeyman''; [[Rip Off Press]]' ''Skull'' and ''Up From the Deep'';  [[Richard Corben]]'s ''Fantagor''; the [[Print Mint]]'s ''Insect Fear'' and ''Deviant Slice''; Shroud's ''Gory Stories'' ; and [[Last Gasp]]'s ''Two Fisted Zombies''.&lt;ref name=Sabin /&gt; Kitchen Sink Press joined the wave with ''Death Rattle''.

The first volume of ''Death Rattle'' featured the work of Tim Boxell as well as contributions from a number of other creators, including [[Richard Corben]], Peter Poplaski, John M. Pound, [[Mike Vosburg]], and [[Tom Veitch]].

== ''Death Rattle'' Vol. 2 ==
''Death Rattle'' volume 2 was notable for being one of the few horror titles published during the 1980s, rivaled only by [[DC Comics]]' ''[[Swamp Thing (comic book)|Swamp Thing]]'' and [[FantaCo Enterprises]]'s ''Gore Shriek''. 

The second volume of ''Death Rattle'' was lead-edited by Dave Schreiner; the series is most notable for [[Jaxon]]'s 11-part, 126-page "Bulto… The Cosmic Slug", about a space creature's effect on the people of the ancient Southwest. [[Rand Holmes]] did many of the covers. [[Mark Schultz (comics)|Mark Schultz]]'s story "Xenozoic!", published in ''Death Rattle'' #8 (Dec. 1986), launched its own title, ''[[Xenozoic Tales]]'', shortly thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Schultz| first = Mark|author2=Williamson, Al |authorlink2=Al Williamson| title = Cadillacs and Dinosaurs| publisher = [[Kitchen Sink Press]] |year = 1993 | location = [[Northampton, Massachusetts]]| page = 4| isbn = 0-87816-071-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other notable contributors to the second volume of ''Death Rattle'' were [[Charles Burns (cartoonist)|Charles Burns]], Charles Dallas, [[Richard Corben]], [[Will Eisner]], [[Steve Stiles]], [[Mike Baron]], [[Sam Kieth]], [[Basil Wolverton]], [[Stephen R. Bissette]], [[Spain Rodriguez]], [[William Stout]], [[Joe Coleman (painter)|Joe Coleman]], [[Al Williamson]], [[Wally Wood]], [[Don Simpson (cartoonist)|Don Simpson]], [[Dan Burr]], and [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]] (who illustrated the cover of the final issue). 

The [[Comic book letter column|letters page]] was known was "Fang Mail."

== ''Death Rattle'' Vol. 3 ==
Contributors to the third volume of ''Death Rattle'' included [[Brian Biggs]], [[Mark Schultz (comics)|Mark Schultz]], [[Mark A. Nelson]], [[John Wagner]], [[Alexander Maleev]], [[James O'Barr]], [[Tony Millionaire]], [[John Wooley]], [[Tom Sutton]], [[Matt Howarth]], and [[Thomas Ott]].

''Death Rattle'' volume 3 was edited by Phil Amara, N. C. Christopher Couch, and Catherine Gornie; it was nominated for the 1997 [[Harvey Award]] for Best Anthology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hahnlibrary.net/comics/awards/harvey97.php "1997 Harvey Award Nominees and Winners,"] Hahn Library.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13545">A '''fiction-writing mode''' is a manner of writing with its own set of conventions regarding how, when, and where it should be used.

[[Fiction]] is a form of [[narrative]], one of the four [[rhetorical modes]] of discourse.  Fiction-writing also has distinct forms of expression, or modes, each with its own purposes and conventions.  Currently, there is no consensus within the writing community regarding the number and composition of fiction-writing modes and their uses. Some writing modes suggested include action, dialogue, thoughts, summary, scene, description, background, exposition and transition.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Marshall|Marshall]], 1998, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=ziBORQpTMD0C&amp;pg=PA143 143-65].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Morrell|Morrell]], 2006, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=qhufPkfjmXgC&amp;pg=PA127 127].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Selgin|Selgin]], 2007, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The concept goes back at least as far as Aristotle who, in ''Poetics'', referred to narration and action as different modes or manner of representing something.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, pp.  3, 5.&lt;/ref&gt; For many years, fiction writing was described has having two types: narration and dialogue. Evan Marshall, in ''The Marshall Plan for Novel Writing'' (1998) noted that writers should know what they are doing at all times. He described what he called ''fiction-writing modes''—the types of writing of which all fiction is made. He listed five modes: action, summary, dialogue, feelings/thoughts, and background, each with its own set of conventions regarding how, when, and where it should be used.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, pp. 143-165.&lt;/ref&gt;

*Jessica Page Morrell, in ''Between the Lines: Master the Subtle Elements of Fiction Writing'' (2006), mentioned six ''delivery modes'': action, exposition, description, dialogue, summary, and transition.&lt;ref&gt;Morrell, p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt; 

*Peter Selgin, in ''By Cunning and Craft: Sound Advice and Practical Wisdom for Fiction Writers'' (2007), mentioned five writing ''methods'': action, dialogue, thoughts, summary, and description.&lt;ref&gt;Selgin, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; 

*Mike Klaassen, in ''Fiction-Writing Modes: Eleven Essential Tools for Bringing Your Story to Life'' (2015), addressed eleven modes: action, summarization, narration, description, exposition, transition, conversation (dialogue), sensation, introspection, emotion, and recollection.&lt;ref&gt;Klaassen, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Narration==
{{main article|Narration}}
In ''Poetics'', Aristotle mentions narration as a mode, or manner of representing something.&lt;ref&gt; Aristotle, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; As a fiction-writing mode, narration is how the [[narrator]] communicates directly to the reader. This contrasts with the use of the term "narration" as a [[rhetorical mode]] of discourse, where it has a broader meaning which encompasses all written fiction.

==Description==
[[Description]] is the fiction-writing mode for transmitting a mental image of the particulars of a story.  Together with [[dialogue]], narration, exposition, and summarization, description is one of the most widely recognized of the fiction-writing modes.  Description is more than the amassing of details, it is bringing a scene to life by carefully choosing and arranging words and phrases to produce the desired effect.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Polking|Polking]], 1990, p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exposition==
{{main article|Exposition (narrative)}}
Broadly defined, exposition is one of four rhetorical modes of discourse. Within the context of fiction-writing modes, exposition is used to convey information.  Exposition may be used to add [[drama]] to a story, but too much exposition at one time may slow the pace of the story.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Kernen|Kernen]], 1999, p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summarization==
[[:wikt:summarisation|Summarization]], or narrative summary, condenses events to convey, rather than to show, what happens within a story.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Marshall|Marshall]], 1998, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=qhufPkfjmXgC&amp;pg=PA144 144-6].&lt;/ref&gt;  The "tell" in the [[axiom]] "[[Show, don't tell]]" is often in the form of summarization.  Summarization may be used to:

* connect parts of a story
* report details of less important events
* skip events that are irrelevant to the plot
* convey an emotional state over an extended period of time&lt;ref&gt;[[#Marshall|Marshall]], 1998, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=qhufPkfjmXgC&amp;pg=PA145 145].&lt;/ref&gt;
* vary the rhythm and texture of the writing&lt;ref&gt;[[#Browne|Browne, King &amp; Booth]], 2004, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

The main advantage of summary is that it takes up less space than other fiction-writing modes.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Selgin|Selgin]], 2007, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;  Effective use of summarization requires a balance between showing and telling, action and summary, with rhythm, pace and tone playing a role.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Card|Card]], 1999, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=gNYtrafWhDwC&amp;pg=PA140 140-2].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Introspection==
{{main article|Introspection}}
Introspection (also referred to as internal dialogue, interior monologue, or self-talk) is the fiction-writing mode used to convey the thoughts of a character, allowing the expression of normally unexpressed thoughts.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Browne|Browne, King &amp; Booth]], 2004, p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt;  Introspection may also be used to:
* enhance a story by allowing the character's thoughts to deepen [[characterisation]]
* increase tension
* widen the scope of a story&lt;ref&gt;[[#Kress|Kress]], 2003, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; 
* play a critical role in both [[scene (fiction)|scene and sequel]]&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bickham|Bickham]], 1993, pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=wzUo-KvpA2UC&amp;g=PA12 12-22], [https://books.google.com/books?id=wzUo-KvpA2UC&amp;g=PA50 50-8]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recollection==
[[Recollection]] is the fiction-writing mode whereby a character [[Memory|remembers]] a detail or event. It plays a vital role in conveying [[Back-story|backstory]] by allowing writers to convey information from earlier in the story or from before the beginning of the story.  Although recollection is not widely recognized as a distinct mode of fiction-writing, it is a common tool.  Recollection could be considered a subset of [[#Introspection|introspection]], but its role in developing backstory separates it from the other thoughts of a character.  Effective presentation of recollection has its own unique issues and challenges.  For example, timing a recollection to avoid implausible-seeming memories (such as when a character must make a key decision) can be difficult, and should be prompted by a recent plot event.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Card|Card]], 1999, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=gNYtrafWhDwC&amp;pg=PA113 113].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sensation==
[[Sensation (fiction)|Sensation]] is used to portray a character's [[perception]]s. It can help draw the reader in by conveying the actual sensations of things comprising the story, breathing life into its physical world.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Rozelle|Rozelle]], 2005, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=6O3CIkg9NDAC&amp;pg=PA76 76].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Morrell|Morrell]], 2006, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=qhufPkfjmXgC&amp;pg=PA172 172].&lt;/ref&gt; Since the reader has experienced only a portion of the sensations experienced by the character, the author aims to either provoke recall from the reader, or convey the experience,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Rozelle|Rozelle]], 2005, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=6O3CIkg9NDAC&amp;pg=PA86 86].&lt;/ref&gt; drawing the reader in and maintaining interest in the story.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Morrell|Morrell]], 2006, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=qhufPkfjmXgC&amp;pg=PA173 173].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Emotion==
The fiction-writing mode of [[emotion]] conveys the feelings of the character, and is a vital component of [[creative writing]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reid|Reid]], 1994, p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt;  Connecting the character to his own emotions allows the author to connect with the reader on an emotional level.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Kempton|Kempton]], 2004, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=ayhE_0hlH34C&amp;pg=PA148 148].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Card|Card]], 1999, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=gNYtrafWhDwC&amp;pg=PA74 74].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Action==
In ''Poetics'', Aristotle refers to action as a mode, or manner of representing something.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Action (fiction)|Action]] is the demonstration of events as they are happening in a story,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Marshall|Marshall]], 1998, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=ziBORQpTMD0C&amp;pg=PA142 142].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Morrell|Morrell]], 2006, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=qhufPkfjmXgC&amp;pg=PA127 127].&lt;/ref&gt; and may help readers feel as if they were participating in the plot.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Rosenfeld|Rosenfeld]], 2008, p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transition==
[[Transition (fiction)|Transitions]] in fiction are words, phrases, sentences, paragraphs, or punctuation that may be used to signal various changes in a story, including changes in time, location, point-of-view character, mood, tone, emotion, and pace.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Morrell|Morrell]], 2006, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=qhufPkfjmXgC&amp;pg=PA281-2 281-2].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Polking|Polking]], 1990, p. 495.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Categories==
Fiction-writing modes may be classified into categories of modes with common features. 
* ''Interiority''&lt;ref&gt;Scofield, p. 6. &lt;/ref&gt; includes modes that reflect the inner workings of the character's mind: introspection, recollection, emotion, and sensation.&lt;ref&gt;Klaassen, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Exteriority'' includes modes that represent what is outside the character's mind: narration, description, exposition, and transition.&lt;ref&gt;Klaassen, p. 147.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Dialogue'' represents a character's speech: conversation.&lt;ref&gt;Klaassen, p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Activity'' includes modes used to portray story events: action and summarization.&lt;ref&gt;Klaassen, p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{italic title}}
'''''Finishing the Hat: Collected Lyrics (1954–1981) with Attendant Comments, Principles, Heresies, Grudges, Whines and Anecdotes''''' is a book by American [[musical theatre]] composer and lyricist [[Stephen Sondheim]]. The book contains Sondheim's lyrics from his first professionally staged show, ''[[Saturday Night (musical)|Saturday Night]]'' (1954) through ''[[West Side Story]]'', ''[[Gypsy: A Musical Fable|Gypsy]]'', ''[[A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum]]'', ''[[Anyone Can Whistle]]'', ''[[Do I Hear a Waltz?]]'', ''[[Company (musical)|Company]]'', ''[[Follies]]'', ''[[A Little Night Music]]'', ''[[The Frogs (musical)|The Frogs]]'', ''[[Pacific Overtures]]'', ''[[Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (musical)|Sweeney Todd, the Demon Barber of Fleet Street]]'', and ending with ''[[Merrily We Roll Along (musical)|Merrily We Roll Along]]'' (1981), stopping just short of the [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning ''[[Sunday in the Park with George]]'' (1984) which contains the song from which the title of the book is taken.

While the book is not an [[autobiography]], and much of it deals with Sondheim's [[lyrics|lyrical technique]] (such as the use of [[Rhyme#Perfect rhymes|perfect rhyme]], proper stressing of syllables, avoiding redundancy), the comments and anecdotes mentioned in the subtitle often deal with his relationships with his collaborators, including [[Arthur Laurents]], [[Jerome Robbins]], [[George Furth]], [[James Lapine]] and [[Leonard Bernstein]], and with events important to the history of American musical theatre.

Additionally Sondheim offers [[Sidebar (publishing)|sidebar]] critiques of some of the most renowned American lyricists of the first half of the 20th century, including [[Ira Gershwin]], [[Irving Berlin]], [[Lorenz Hart]], [[Alan Jay Lerner]], [[Frank Loesser]], and his own mentor, [[Oscar Hammerstein II]]. Sondheim only discusses the works and styles of lyricists and composers who have died, for he states that he does not want to personally hurt anyone or ruin their reputation.

The book's second volume, '''''Look, I Made a Hat: Collected Lyrics (1981-2011) with Attendant Comments, Amplifications, Dogmas, Harangues, Wafflings, Diversions and Anecdotes''''' covers the remainder of his theatrical works, as well as the various writing he has done for films, plays and further deleted works. [https://www.amazon.com/Look-Made-Hat-Amplifications-Diversions/dp/030759341X]

It was published on October 29, 2010 by [[Alfred A. Knopf]], and is 444 pages.

'''''Forward the Foundation''''' is a novel by American writer [[Isaac Asimov]], published posthumously in 1993. It is the second of two prequels to the [[Foundation Series|''Foundation'' Series]]. It is written in much the same style as the original novel ''[[Foundation (Isaac Asimov novel)|Foundation]]'', a novel composed of chapters with long intervals in between. Both books were first published as independent short stories in science fiction magazines.

The parallels between [[Hari Seldon]] and Isaac Asimov found in this book— the last one written by Asimov before his death— and the focus on Hari Seldon as he grows old and dies, strengthen the idea that Asimov considered Seldon his literary alter ego. Critics such as Josh Wimmer and Alasdair Wilkins have regarded many of the opinions and viewpoints expressed by Seldon in this book as [[autobiographical]]. Thus, a detailed reading of ''Forward the Foundation'' can shed light on Asimov's inner thoughts at the end of his life.&lt;ref name=completed/&gt;

Like other previous science fiction works by Asimov, the book was a commercial success, becoming a ''[[New York Times]]'' bestselling work.&lt;ref name=completed&gt;http://io9.com/5801963/in-which-a-great-work-is-finally-completed-isaac-asimovs-forward-the-foundation&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
''Forward the Foundation'' continues the chronicles of the life of [[Hari Seldon]], first begun in ''[[Prelude to Foundation]]''. 
The story takes place on [[Trantor]], and begins eight years after the events of ''Prelude to Foundation''. It depicts how Seldon develops his theory of [[Psychohistory (fictional)|psychohistory]] from hypothetical concept to practical application.

In the latter years of the reign of Emperor [[Cleon I]], Seldon is dragged into the world of galactic politics as Cleon's somewhat unwilling First Minister, after the resignation of his predecessor, Eto Demerzel (whom Seldon knows as the robot [[R. Daneel Olivaw]]). After the Emperor is assassinated, a military junta takes over for a disastrous decade. Seldon steps down from his government position and resumes leadership of the psychohistory project. 

Seldon and others, most notably Yugo Amaryl, finally develop [[Psychohistory (fictional)|psychohistory]] to the point that he can initiate what will come to be known as the [[Seldon Plan]], the road map for drastically shortening the interregnum between the First and Second Empires.&lt;ref&gt;Isaac Asimov. ''Forward the Foundation''. Spectra. January 4, 1993. {{ISBN|0-553-56507-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gradually, Seldon loses all those who are close to him. Seldon's consort [[Dors Venabili|Dors]] is killed (or rather destroyed) in an internal plot by an ambitious member of Seldon's own group. His adopted son [[Raych Seldon|Raych]] emigrates with his wife and a daughter to Santanni, though his elder daughter [[Wanda Seldon|Wanda]] remains with Seldon. When a rebellion against the Empire breaks out, Raych sends his wife and daughter away on a starship, but he remains behind to defend his university and is killed, and the starship is never seen again. Yugo Amaryl, the second best psychohistory researcher (after Seldon himself), dies in middle age, worn out by his work. Except for his granddaughter Wanda, Seldon is alone in his fight to keep the project going in the face of the [[Galactic Empire (Asimov)|Galactic Empire]]'s accelerating decline and lessening government support. 

Wanda turns out to be what Seldon calls a "mentalic": someone who can read minds and actually influence people. (Seldon suspects that her father Raych's great likeability is a subconscious use of the same power.) They are able to find a few other mentalics, enabling Seldon to set up a second guardian for the Seldon Plan. Eventually, he sends Wanda and the others to another star system to establish the Second Foundation in secret. While the public First Foundation concentrates on the physical sciences, the hidden Second's psychohistorians will develop the mental ones.

'''Gridiron football''',&lt;ref name=Britannica&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/212839/gridiron-football "Gridiron football"]. ''Encyclopædia Britannica''. Retrieved October 20, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; also known as '''North American football'''&lt;ref&gt;See, for example: Jack Brimberg and William Hurley (2006). "Strategic considerations in the coaching of North American football". ''International Journal of Sport Management and Marketing''. From ''International Journal of Sport Management and Marketing'', Volume 1, Number 3, pp. 279–287.&lt;/ref&gt; or simply '''football''', is a [[football]] sport primarily played in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]]. [[American football]], which uses 11-player teams, is the form played in the United States and the best known form of gridiron football worldwide, while [[Canadian football]], featuring 12-player teams, predominates in Canada. Other derivative varieties include [[Indoor American football|indoor football]], football for smaller teams (most commonly [[Eight-man football|eight players]]), and informal games such as [[Touch football (American)|touch]] and [[flag football]]. Football is played at professional, collegiate, semi-professional, and amateur levels.

The sport originated in the 19th century out of older games related to modern [[rugby football]] and [[soccer]] (association football). American and Canadian football developed alongside each other and were originally more distinct before Canadian teams adopted features of the American game.&lt;ref name=Flaherty&gt;{{cite book |last= Flaherty|first= David H. |last2= Manning|first2= Frank E.|date= 1993 |title=The Beaver Bites Back?: American Popular Culture in Canada |url= https://books.google.com/?id=5xcRX1wwqy4C&amp;pg=PA16&amp;dq=%22Canadian+football%22+American#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Canadian%20football%22%20American&amp;f=false |location= |publisher= [[McGill–Queen's Press]]|page= 16|isbn=978-0-7735-1120-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both varieties are distinguished from other football sports by their use of hard plastic [[football helmet|helmets]] and [[shoulder pads]], the [[forward pass]], the [[Down (gridiron football)|system of downs]], a number of unique rules and [[American football positions|positions]], measurement in customary units of [[yard (unit)|yards]] (even in Canada, which mostly [[Metrication in Canada|metricated in the 1970s]], yards are still used), and a [[Ball (gridiron football)|distinctive brown leather ball]] in the shape of a [[prolate spheroid]] with pointed ends.

The international governing body for the sport is the [[International Federation of American Football]] (IFAF); although the organization plays all of its international competitions under American rules, it uses a definition of the game that is broad enough that it includes Canadian football under its umbrella, and [[Football Canada]] (the governing body for Canadian football) is an IFAF member.

== History ==
The sport developed from informal games played in North America during the 19th century. Early games had a variety of local rules and were generally similar to modern [[rugby union]] and [[soccer]]. By the 1860s, teams from universities were playing each other, leading to more standardized rules and the creation of [[college football]]. While several American schools adopted rules based on the soccer rules of the British [[Football Association]], [[Harvard University]] held to its traditional "carrying game". Meanwhile, [[McGill University]] in [[Montreal]] used rules based on [[rugby union]]. In 1874, Harvard and [[McGill University]] in [[Montreal]] organized two games using each other's rules. Harvard took a liking to McGill's rugby-style rules, and subsequently played several other U.S. colleges over the next several years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Bernstein | first = Mark F. | title = Football: The Ivy League Origins of an American Obsession | publisher = University of Pennsylvania Press | year = 2001 | isbn = 978-0-8122-3627-9 |pages=9–10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

American football teams and organizations subsequently adopted new rules which distinguished the game from rugby.&lt;ref name=PFRA2&gt;{{cite web|title=Camp and His Followers: American Football 1876–1889 |work=The Journey to Camp: The Origins of American Football to 1889 |publisher=Professional Football Researchers Association |url=http://www.profootballresearchers.org/Articles/Camp_And_Followers.pdf |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5qRx5vacY?url=http://www.profootballresearchers.org/Articles/Camp_And_Followers.pdf |archivedate=June 13, 2010 |accessdate=2010-01-26 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the most consequential changes was the adoption of the [[forward pass]] in 1906, which allowed the [[quarterback]] to throw the ball forward over the [[line of scrimmage]] to a receiver.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Vancil | first = Mark (''Ed.'') | title = ABC Sports College Football All-Time All-America Team | publisher=Hyperion Books | location = New York | year = 2000|page=18 | isbn = 978-0-7868-6710-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Canadian football remained akin to rugby for decades, though a progressive faction of players, chiefly based in the [[western provinces]], demanded changes to the game based on the innovations in American football. Over the years, the sport adopted more Americanized rules, though it retained some of its historical features, including a 110-yard field, 12-player teams, and three downs instead of four.&lt;ref name=Flaherty /&gt;

== Versions ==
* [[American football]] is the most common and widely known of these sports. It was originally more closely related to rugby, until various rule changes created by [[Walter Camp]] were implemented in 1880. It is played with eleven players to a side, four downs and a 100-yard field. The major professional league, the [[National Football League]] (NFL), has its own rule book. [[College football]] programs generally play under the code defined in the NCAA Football Rules and Interpretations. High schools generally follow the rules and interpretations published by the National Federation of High School Associations (NFHS), although some states follow the NCAA code for high school play. Youth games (below high school age) generally follow NFHS code with modifications. Adult semi-pro, alternative and minor professional, amateur, touch, flag, etc. may follow any one of these codes or use their own rules. While the vast majority of the game is the same among these three codes, subtle variations in rules can lead to large difference in play.  Many of the differences are in penalty enforcement and the definitions of fouls.
[[File:Commonwealth Stadium, Edmonton, August 2005.jpg|thumb|Canadian Football League field]]
* [[Canadian football]] is played almost exclusively in Canada. Like its American cousin, it was originally more closely related to rugby, until the [[Burnside rules]] were adopted in 1903. The game is played on a 110-yard field and has three downs and twelve players to a side. The Canadian game also features a one-point "[[single (football)|single]]" (formally called a "rouge") for a ball kicked into the end zone and not returned by the receiving team. Like the American game, the [[Canadian Football League]] and [[Canadian Interuniversity Sport]] both have their own rulebooks, although there are generally fewer differences than between their American counterparts.
* [[Nine-man football]], [[eight-man football]] and [[six-man football]] are varieties of gridiron football played with fewer players. They are played with four downs (often with a 15-yard requirement for a new set of downs, as opposed to 10 in other codes), fewer [[offensive lineman|offensive linemen]], and an 80-yard field. These games are generally based on the high school rulebooks, which have an addendum devoted to the play of these codes.
* [[indoor American football|Indoor football]] is played with special rules to accommodate smaller indoor facilities. It is played on a 50-yard field with, usually, eight players to a side. Prototype games were played in [[World Series of Football (1902)|1902]] and [[NFL Playoff Game, 1932|1932]], both of which used the shortened field but followed the outdoor standard 11 to a side. However, indoor football did not gain popularity until [[Jim Foster (football)|James F. Foster]]'s proprietary version, [[arena football]], debuted in 1986, and set most of the standards for indoor leagues today. As almost all indoor leagues are for-profit professional leagues, each league has its own proprietary code.
* [[Touch football (American)|Touch football]], [[flag football]] and [[street football (American)|backyard football]] are informal varieties of the game, played primarily at an amateur and recreational level. No specific rulebooks are universally recognized for these variants, where [[house rule]]s usually apply.

This is a minimal description of the game in general, with elements common to all or almost all variants of the game. For more specific rules, see each code's individual articles.

Prior to the start of a game, a [[coin flipping|coin toss]] determines which team will [[Kickoff (American football)|kick off]] the ball to their opponent. Each team lines up on opposite halves of the field, with a minimum ten yards of space between them for the kickoff. The team receiving the ball can make a [[fair catch]] (which stops the play immediately), catch the ball and run it back until the ball carrier is tackled, or, if the ball is kicked [[out of bounds]], let the ball go [[dead ball|dead]] on its own (the last case usually happens when the ball is kicked all the way into or through the opponent's end zone, resulting in a [[touchback]] and the ball being brought several yards out of the end zone to begin play). A kicking team can, under special circumstances, attempt to [[onside kick|recover its own kick]], but the rules of the game make it very difficult to do so reliably, and so this tactic is usually only used as a surprise or desperation maneuver.

At this point, [[play from scrimmage]] begins.  The team in possession of the ball is on ''offense'' and the opponent is on ''defense''. The offense is given a set amount of time (up to forty seconds, depending on the governing body), during which the teams can set up a play in a [[huddle]] and freely substitute players to set into a [[formation (American football)|formation]], in which the offense must remain perfectly still for at least one second (the formation requirement does not apply to Canadian football). At least half of the players (seven in standard American and Canadian football, four in standard indoor ball) on the offense must line up on the [[line of scrimmage]] in this formation, including the snapper, who handles the ball before play commences; the rest can (and almost always do) line up behind the line. Neither the offense nor the defense can cross the line of scrimmage before the play commences. Once the formation is set, the snapper [[snap (football)|snaps]] the ball to one of the players behind him. (A snapper must snap the ball within 20 to 25 seconds of the official setting the ball back into position after the previous play, and a [[play clock]] is kept to enforce the measure.) Once the ball is snapped, the play has commenced, and the offense's goal is to continue advancing the ball toward their opponent's [[end zone]]. This can be done either by running with the ball or by a rule unique to football known as the ''[[forward pass]]''. In a forward pass, a player from behind the line of scrimmage throws the ball to an [[eligible receiver]] (another back or one player on each end of the line), who must catch the ball before it touches the ground. The play stops when a player with the ball touches any part of his body other than hand or foot to the ground, runs [[out of bounds|out of the boundaries]] of the field, is obstructed from making further forward progress, or a forward pass hits the ground without being caught (in the last case, the ball returns to the spot it was snapped). To stop play, players on defense are allowed to tackle the ball carrier at any time the ball is in play, provided they do not grab the face mask of the helmet or make helmet-to-helmet contact when doing so. At any time, the player with the ball can attempt a [[lateral pass|backward, or lateral, pass]] to any other player in order to keep the ball in play; this is generally rare. Any player on defense can, at any time, attempt to [[interception|intercept]] a forward pass in flight, at which point the team gains possession; they can also gain possession by recovering a [[fumble]] or stripping the ball away from the ball carrier (a "forced fumble"). A typical play can last between five and twenty seconds.

In the event that any illegal action happens during the play, the results of the previous play are erased and a [[penalty (gridiron football)|penalty]] is assessed, forcing the offending team to surrender between five and fifteen yards of field to the opponent. Whether this yardage is measured from the original spot of the ball before the play, the spot of the illegal action, or the end of the play depends on the individual foul. The most common penalties include ''false start'' (when an offensive player jumps to begin the play before the ball is snapped, a five-yard penalty), ''holding'' (the grabbing of a player other than the ball carrier to obstruct their progress; a ten-yard penalty against offensive players and a five-yard penalty against defensive ones), and ''pass interference'' (when either a receiver or the defending player pushes or blocks the other to prevent them from catching the pass). A team on offense cannot score points as the direct result of a penalty; a defensive foul committed in the team's own end zone, if the penalty is assessed from the spot of the foul, places the ball at the one-yard line. In contrast, a defensive team can score points as a direct result of a penalty; if the offense commits a foul under the same scenario, the defensive team receives two points and a free kick. In all other circumstances (except for the open-ended and extremely rare [[unfair act]] clause), a penalty cannot exceed more than half the distance to the end zone. In the event that the penalty would be less advantageous than the result of the actual play, the team not committing the penalty can decline it.

In order to keep play moving, the offense must make a certain amount of progress (10 yards in most leagues) within a certain number of plays (3 in Canada, 4 in the United States), called [[down (American football)|downs]]. If the offense does indeed make this progress, a ''first down'' is achieved, and the team gets 3 or 4 more plays to achieve another 10 yards. If not, the offense loses possession to their opponent at the spot where the ball is. More commonly, however, the team on offense will, if they have a minimal chance of gaining a first down and have only one play left to do it (''fourth down'' in the U.S., ''third down'' in Canada), attempt a ''scrimmage kick''. There are two types of scrimmage kick: a [[Punt (gridiron football)|punt]] is when the ball is kicked downfield as close to the opponent's end zone as possible without entering it; the kicking team loses possession of the ball after the kick and the receiving team can attempt to advance the ball. The other scrimmage kick is a [[field goal (football)|field goal]] attempt. This must be attempted by [[placekicker|place kick]] or (more rarely) [[drop kick]], and if the kicked ball passes through the goal set at the edge of the opponent's end zone, the team scores three points. (Four-point field goals are available in a few variations of the game under special rules, but the NFL, college and high school football only offer three-point field goals.) In Canada, any kick that goes into the end zone and is not returned, whether it be a punt or a missed field goal, is awarded [[single (football)|one single point]].

If the team in possession of the ball, at any time, advances (either by carrying or catching) the ball into the opponent's end zone, it is a [[touchdown]], and the team scores six points and a free play known as a [[try (American football)|try]]. In a try, a team attempts to score [[Conversion (gridiron football)|one]] or [[two-point conversion|two]] points (rules vary by each league, but under standard rules, a field goal on a try is worth one point while another touchdown is worth two). At the college and professional levels, the defense can also score on a try, but only on the same scale (thus a botched try the defense returns for a touchdown scores only two points and not six).

If a team is in its own end zone and commits a foul, is tackled with the ball, or bats, fumbles, kicks or throws the ball backward out of the field of play through the same end zone, the defense scores a [[safety (American football score)|safety]], worth two points.

After a try, safety or field goal, the team that had possession of the ball goes back to the middle of the field and kicks the ball off to their opponent, and play continues as it did in the beginning of the game.

Play continues until [[halftime]]. (Each team switches their side of the field with the other halfway through each half, at the end of a quarter.) After the halftime break, a new kickoff occurs. Whichever team has more points at the end of the game is declared the winner; in the event of a tie, each league has its own rules for [[overtime (sports)|overtime]] to break the tie. Because of the nature of the game, pure [[sudden death (sport)|sudden-death]] overtimes have been abolished at all levels of the game as of 2012.

At all adult levels of the game, a game is 60 timed minutes in length, split into four 15-minute quarters. (High school football uses 12-minute quarters, and the general rule is that the younger the players, the shorter the quarters typically are.) Because of the halftime, quarter breaks, time-outs, the minute warnings ([[two-minute warning|two minutes before the end of a half in the NFL]], [[three-minute warning|three minutes in Canadian football]]), and frequent stoppages of the game clock (the clock stops, for example, after every incomplete pass and any time a ball goes out of bounds), the actual time it takes for a football game to be completed is typically over three hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2017/03/22/roger-goodell-plans-to-speed-up-pace-nfl-games-2017/99491048/#|title=Exclusive: Roger Goodell says changes coming to quicken NFL games in 2017|work=USA Today|first=Tom|last=Pelissero|date=March 24, 2017|accessdate=March 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''High Chaparral''' is a [[Wild West]] theme park and post-industrial museum of cultural artifacts and collectibles, located close to [[Värnamo]], [[Sweden]]. It opened in 1966 and was founded by Bengt Erlandson, more commonly known as Big Bengt.

The park is located near [[Hillerstorp]] in [[Gnosjö Municipality]] and is close to{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} [[European route E4|E4]] motorway and Swedish national road 27.

== Big Bengt, the founder ==
Big Bengt was born in 1922 in [[Brännehylte]], [[Småland]] of the [[Sweden|Kingdom of Sweden]] in [[Scandinavia]], northern [[Europe]]. His parents owned a forest farm and a wood mill. Big Bengt was involved in starting over 1,000 companies{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}. His interest in the American frontier and [[Western United States|Wild West]] was born from coming from a countryside where many had emigrated to [[United States|America]] and from the stories they told. Bengt went to the United States himself in 1956 at age 34 and in 4 months touring covered 4,000&amp;nbsp;km. He came back to [[Sweden]] with a lot of impressions. When the Swedish national phone company had to get rid of 200,000 telephone poles, Bengt took the opportunity and constructed a western American style frontier fort and town with log cabins as it might have been used by the old [[United States Cavalry]] and [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] in the [[Indian Wars]] on the western frontier in [[North America]] during the [[19th century]]. When many people started to get curious about the place, he realized its commercial/tourist and historical purposes and possibilities. Similar to [[Walt Disney]]'s construction of various [[Disneyland]]s and [[Disney World]]s with "Frontierlands" portions built into the entertainment parks in several foreign countries decades later.&lt;ref name="Christensen-173"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9WpNqwZVVmcC&amp;pg=PA173&amp;lpg=PA173&amp;dq=Big+Bengt+Erlandsson+Museum&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=OfHvm-xC0w&amp;sig=kpTCN_dPw3dkGT1C3gMrh5gDfZg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=pgfwUbK9Aq7pigLa-ICgCg&amp;ved=0CFYQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Big%20Bengt%20Erlandsson%20Museum&amp;f=false | title=Extreme entrepreneurs | publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing | work=Managing Complexity and Change in SMEs: Frontiers in European Research | date=Jan 1, 2006 | accessdate=24 July 2013 | author=P.

"Big" Bengt Erlandsson died in March 2016.&lt;ref&gt;http://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=106&amp;artikel=6394889&lt;/ref&gt;

== Park ==
The park was opened in 1966, the year before the debut of ''"[[The High Chaparral]]" '' an extended hour-long western television series in the new color broadcasting that ran on American TV on the [[NBC]] ([[National Broadcasting Company]]) television network, for four seasons, 1967-1971, starring [[Leif Erickson]], [[Linda Cristal]], [[Henry Darrow]] and [[Cameron Mitchell (actor)|Cameron Mitchell]]. It focused on the adventures and drama about the  large but struggling cattle ranch "The High Chaparral" on the high desert scrublands of southern  [[Arizona Territory]] near the [[Mexico|Mexican]] border and conflicts with the  [[Apache]] Indians and their famous chief [[Cochise]] and the  local [[United States Cavalry]] / [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] troops. It's the stories of newly arrived owner "Big John" Cannon (former [[Union Army]] captain in the recent [[American Civil War]], 1861-1865), his brother Buck, who fought for the  opposing southern [[Confederate States Army|Confederacy]], John's son "Blue Boy" and new beautiful dark-haired sophisticated Latino/Mexican wife Victoria, thirty years his junior, daughter from a neighboring Mexican cattle baron across the border that he has forged an alliance against his opposition.

It was produced by [[David Dortort]], who also created the earlier hit American TV series also on NBC. ''"Bonanza"'' (1959-1973) about the Cartwright family - a father and three sons by successive wives on a huge ranch named "The Ponderosa" near [[Lake Tahoe]] on the [[California]]-[[Nevada]] border at the edge of the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] mountains chain by the rich [[silver]] strike of the "[[Comstock Lode]]" mines of famed [[Virginia City, Nevada]] in the 1870s also.

The theme park stages several stunt shows a day. It also has a steam train that runs through the park. There is both the classic Wild West section, an Indian themed area, a Mexican themed area, and a museum overflowing with cultural artifacts, old cars, machinery, and various [[Cold War]] oddities such as the bronze monster-size statue of [[Lenin]] expelled from [[Nowa Huta]].

The '''Hip Hop Hall of Fame''', also known as the '''Hip Hop Hall of Fame + Museum''', is a New York chartered non-profit 501 c(3) museum and educational institution whose focus is [[hip hop]] music and culture from around the world.

==History==

The Hip Hop Hall of Fame was founded in 1992 by Hip Hop Hall of Fame Awards creator and executive producer James 'JT' Thompson, a New York City native and Los Angeles-raised hip hop connoisseur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=After 24 years, this Army vet is making the Hip Hop Hall of Fame a reality|url=https://nypost.com/2016/02/19/after-24-years-this-army-vet-is-making-the-hip-hop-hall-of-fame-a-reality/|publisher=NY Post|accessdate=10 January 2018|date=February 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hip Hop Hall of Fame was launched globally in September 1995 at [[Harlem]]'s historic restaurant [[Sylvia's Restaurant of Harlem|Sylvia's]], which unveiled the plans for the museum, educational programs, and the [[BET|BET Cable Network]] deal for the inaugural Hip Hop Hall of Fame Awards TV Show. The event was attended by hip hop forefather [[DJ Kool Herc]], [[Grandmaster Caz]], [[PebbleePoo]], DLB of [[The Fearless Four (band)|the Fearless Four]], [[DJ Tony Tone]], [[LA Sunshine]] of the [[Treacherous Three]], Hip Hop Original Radio Deejays [[Mr. Magic]] and Kool [[DJ Red Alert]], [[DJ Lord Yoda X]], Easy AD of the [[Cold Crush Brothers]], [[Pee Wee Dance]], and more hip hop figures.

The Hip Hop Hall of Fame Museum was to be funded by the Hip Hop Hall of Fame Awards TV Shows after broadcasting on BET, produced with Juanita Williams of Dove Entertainment in the mid 1990s, modeled after the [[Rock n Roll Hall of Fame]] model. However, due to the media-hyped artist beefs that led to the tragic deaths of [[Tupac Shakur]] and the [[Notorious BIG]] after the show broadcasts, the Hip Hop Hall of Fame + Museum lost advertisers and sponsorship clients and could not return to the airwaves during that era, putting the museum building plans on hiatus. The Hip Hop Hall of Fame also attempted a re-launch in [[Los Angeles]] in 1997 that featured [[Kurtis Blow]], [[Prince Whipper Whip]] of the [[Fantastic Five]], [[Grandmaster Caz]] of the [[Cold Crush Brothers]], founder and executive producer James 'JT' Thompson, [[The Watts Prophets]], The Legendary Actor - Rapper 'Dolemite', Dominique DiPrima of The Beat &amp; [[KJLH]] Radio, and more film and television personalities, but the awards still could not return to television until 2014.

==Museum==
The official Hip Hop Hall of Fame Museum offices are currently headquartered in [[Harlem]], [[New York City]]. Its community space features hip hop art, music, digital video, dance, and community event space for its educational outreach with its partner organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hip-Hop Hall of Fame Launches Fundraiser for New York Museum|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/hip-hop-hall-of-fame-in-the-works-20141219|publisher=Rolling Stone|accessdate=10 January 2018|date=December 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The new development project to house the Hip Hop Hall of Fame + Museum and a hotel entertainment complex is set to be built in a new Harlem location on 125th street.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The city's first hip hop museum headed to Harlem next year, midtown in 2017|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/manhattan/rap-hip-hop-museum-planned-harlem-article-1.2050527|publisher=New York Daily News|accessdate=10 January 2018|date=December 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 20-story facility as designed will include the actual Hall of Fame, a gift store, arcade, TV broadcast studios, a sports bar, restaurant and concert venue producing over 100 events annually. The Hip Hop Hall of Fame educational programming includes a youth arts and media training academy and will accommodate over 25,000 NYC public school kids on educational field trips and programs annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=HIP-HOP HALL OF FAME MUSEUM COMES HOME WITH HARLEM LOCATION|url=http://www.newsweek.com/hip-hop-hall-fame-museum-coming-new-york-city-623383|publisher=Newsweek|accessdate=10 January 2018|date=June 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The complex is scheduled for phase one in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Harlem Will Soon Be Home To A 20-Story Hip Hop Museum|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hip-hop-hall-of-fame-museum-wins-bid-for-harlem-development-site_us_59401bcde4b0e84514eea1bf|publisher=Huffington Post|accessdate=10 January 2018|date=June 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Jim Rose Circus''' is a modern-day version of a circus [[sideshow]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/special_report/1999/08/99/edinburgh_festival_99/422168.stm Jim Rose: The Shocking Truth]". ''BBC News'', August 17, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Coury Turczyn, [http://www.popcultmag.com/obsessions/profilesingreatness/jimrose/rose1.html "Geek Love"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060720195308/http://www.popcultmag.com/obsessions/profilesingreatness/jimrose/rose1.html |date=2006-07-20 }}, ''PopCult Magazine'', April 15, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; It was founded in [[Seattle]] in 1991 by Jim Rose and his wife BeBe Aschard Rose.The sideshow came to prominence to an American audience as a second stage show at the 1992 [[Lollapalooza]] festival, then called the "Jim Rose Circus Sideshow", although they had toured the Northwest and Canada and had several US TV appearances before this time. ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine called the show an "absolute must-see act" and [[USA Today]] termed Rose's troupe "Lollapalooza's word-of-mouth hit attraction".

==Tours==
After Lollapalooza, in 1993 Jim Rose headlined seven world tours and released a self-titled video on [[Rick Rubin]]'s [[American Recordings (US)|American Recordings]] that quickly became a [[cult classic]].

In 1994, the Jim Rose Circus was chosen to tour with [[Nine Inch Nails]], [[Pop Will Eat Itself]] and a then-unknown [[Marilyn Manson (band)|Marilyn Manson]], and later with [[KoRn]] and [[Godsmack]]. 1998 saw another world tour featuring female sumo wrestling, Mexican transvestite wrestling and chainsaw football. The show landed Rose and troupe in jail in [[Lubbock, Texas]] and for four months the show was banned from New Zealand. 

Jim Rose was also the top ticket of the Melbourne (Australia), New Zealand and Edinburgh (Scotland) Fringe and Comedy Festivals.{{when|date=May 2013}}

On September 18 2018 Jim Rose announced that he has has formed the Jim Rose Zombie Circus. Which will be a mix of American Halloween and European comedy horror spectacle with amazing acrobats and other mesmerizing performers along with pyrotechnics and the beat of a big brass band playing and running around the stage all at the same time. No dates or performers have been announced at this time. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNpxAzK3y8I&amp;t=9s&lt;/ref&gt;

==Performers==
[[Image:JimRose.jpg|thumb|Jim Rose in 2005]]

Rose himself performs in between acts, mostly comedy but often stunts as well such as attaching paper currency to his forehead with a staple gun, driving a long nail into his nostril and having darts thrown into his back. During the show's final act, he would escape from a straitjacket. His most outrageous trick followed: he would invite audience members to stand on his head after he had placed it in a shallow crate of broken glass.

* '''The Amazing Mister Lifto''' (Joe Hermann) who hung heavy weights (cinder blocks, steam irons, beer kegs, etc.) from his body piercings, including those in his nipples and genitalia. At Lollapalooza Lifto would perform the "genital lift" feat after spraying shaving cream on himself.
* '''Bebe the Circus Queen''' (Beatrice Aschard) would perform a variety of stunts such as having a watermelon placed on her back and split with a sword, lying on a bed of nails while weights were placed on her chest... or the "Plastic Bag Of Death", where she gets into a large plastic bag and one of the other performers sucks all of the air out with a vacuum cleaner. She would also employ an electric grinder in her act (for example, she would create a shower of sparks from a metal chastity belt covering her groin area).
* '''Matt "The Tube" Crowley''', whose moniker came from the seven feet of tubing that he would swallow. The other end of the tube was attached to a crude hand pump. Rose himself would fill the pump with a variety of fluids and proceed to pump it into Crowley's stomach, then back out again. Audience members were invited onstage to drink the vile concoction after it had been extricated from Crowley. He would also provide a demonstration of sheer lung power by blowing up a hot water bottle with his mouth until it burst. Other gags included sucking a black condom in through his mouth and out his nose (and reversing the procedure) and working a long piece of plastic fluorescent cord through his nasal passages in order to "floss" his nose. 
* '''[[Zamora the Torture King]]''' (Tim Cridland) had a segment that featured him walking barefoot up and down a ladder of razor sharp sabres, piercing himself with long needles and meat skewers, eating pieces of a broken lightbulb (he would hold a microphone near his mouth so the audience would hear the sound), and touching an electrical generator while holding a fluorescent lightbulb that would glow. In 1994, The Torture King left the Circus to create his own show. The Torture King Show toured the US and Canada many times. He currently lives and performs in Las Vegas.
* '''[[The Enigma (performer)|The Enigma]]''' (Paul Lawrence), originally known as '''Slug''', was billed as a man who would eat anything (including slugs, worms, and grasshoppers), and swallow a variety of swords. He also doubled as the show's organ player. His body is completely tattooed with blue jigsaw puzzle pieces. He left the show in 1998 and has toured  since, appearing in such acts as  The Human Marvels and most recently, the Show Devils.
* '''[[The Lizardman]]''' is a completely tattooed performer with a surgically split tongue (featured on Ripley's Believe It or Not) joined Jim in 1999 on the Godsmack Voodoo Tour and in 2001 toured with just Jim and Bebe doing comedy clubs.  He performed several acts previously done by members who had left (Lifto, Enigma, Matt the Tube) and added new acts and routines to the circus. He left the circus in 2001 to return to his solo show endeavors.
* '''Cappy''' (David Capurro) is an award-winning yoyo artist.  Featured in ''The Jim Rose Twisted Tour''.
* '''Rupert''' ([[Ryan Stock]]) performed the traditional sideshow stunts.  He now stars in his own show on the Discovery Channel with partner Amber Lynn.
* '''John Chaos''' performs traditional stunts. He later staged his own one-man show, the John Chaos Sideshow, mixing classic and new stunts with offbeat humor and magic tricks. Chaos still performs with the Jim Rose Circus from time to time.
* '''[[Jake Roberts|Jake "the Snake" Roberts]]'''
* '''[[Nick Cvjetkovich|SiNn BoHdi]]''' formally known as Kizarny of the WWE
* '''Brianna Belladonna''', a female sword swallower who performed at Sturgis with the circus in 2010.
* '''Jimmy Coffin''', a working act. Later he toured the USA as a solo sideshow artist as the "Jimmy Coffin Sideshow".
* '''[[Matt Alaeddine|"Fat Matt" Alaeddine]]''', billed as the world's fattest contortionist

==Television and other media==

Jim Rose and The Enigma were featured in the Season 2 episode of ''[[The X-Files]]'', "[[Humbug (The X-Files)|Humbug]]"; the episode was set in a community of sideshow and former sideshow workers.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0741474/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Homer Simpson]] runs away and joins the Jim Rose Circus as a cannonball catcher (not to be confused with a [[human cannonball]]) on the episode "[[Homerpalooza]]" of ''[[The Simpsons]]''.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0701127/&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Jim Rose Circus Sideshow'' video tape (1993 American Recordings) was re-released in 2003 as a DVD by Moonshine Music.

''The Jim Rose Twisted Tour''&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|0421375}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a seven-episode series that debuted March 2003 on the opening week of the Travel Channel, although only five episodes were aired. It was released in 2006 on DVD, which includes all episodes.

Jim Rose appeared in the movie ''Doubting Riley'', a film by [[HBO]]'s Project Greenlight alumni. Rose voiced the psychotic character Psymon Stark in the video games ''[[SSX Tricky]]'' and ''[[Sled Storm]]''.

==Publications==
Jim Rose wrote the autobiographical ''Freak Like Me (Real, Raw, and Dangerous)'' with journalist [[Melissa Rossi]] in 1995 ({{ISBN|9780440507444}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Inside the Jim Rose Circus Sideshow |first=Margot |last=Mifflin |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,299934,00.html |newspaper=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |date=15 December 1995 |accessdate=27 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book describes Rose's early years and features a [[Stream of consciousness (narrative mode)|stream of consciousness]] on-the-road account of the Jim Rose Circus tour with [[Lollapalooza]]. The book's title is a reference to ''[[Black Like Me]]''.

Rose also released the book ''Angles'' in 1999 and ''Snake Oil (Life's Calculations, Misdirections, And Manipulations)'' in 2005. The cover art was by [[Gail Potocki]]. Jim Rose also wrote the introduction to the book ''[[Gail Potocki]]: The Union of Hope and Sadness'' in 2006.

Rose was written about extensively in Marilyn Manson's autobiography 'Long Hard Road Out Of Hell'. The stories refer to the 1994 'Downward Spiral Tour' with [[Marilyn Manson]] and [[Nine Inch Nails]]. Road manager Jan Gregor wrote ''Circus of the Scars'' (Brennan Dalsgard Pub 1998 {{ISBN|0966347900}}) about the group's formation and first tours.

==Politics==

According to an interview with ''[[Oddities Magazine]]'', Jim Rose claims to have been involved in fundraising for the [[Mo Udall]] political campaign during a time in his life when he was addicted to [[heroin]]. He was quoted as stating that "[Mo] ran against [[Jimmy Carter]] and I was his fundraiser... I used to do fundraisers with like [[Gregory Peck]] and [[Robert Redford]], actually while I was on heroin. They didn’t know... actually I forgot to tell them."&lt;ref name=Oddities&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.azalert.com/odd/?p=11 | title=Inside the Grotesque and Deceptive World of Jim Rose | publisher=Azalert.com | work=Oddities Magazine |ISSN=2159-4708| date=December 13, 2010 | accessdate=January 23, 2018 | author=Horn, Jesse| authorlink = Jesse Horn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 Jim Rose became one of four contributors to the "Fraud, Scam, Rip Off and Con Artists BEWARE" website, a not-for-profit organisation aimed at informing the public about [[confidence tricks]] and exposing artist and band [[phishing]] techniques used by predators.

In 2013 Jim Rose started working with underground artists to help them fight against corporate entertainment promoters by using DIY marketing techniques. He released the video "Bands Beware Of Jim Rose Circus Scam That Actually Works To Make You Better Known" as part of a charity event taping.

==Consultant==

Rose has been hired by corporations including [[Microsoft]] and regularly speaks as a consultant for PR firms; in this regard he has been pictured on the cover of ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' and ''[[Fast Company (magazine)|Fast Company]]'', and is featured in the marketing book ''The Deviant's Advantage''. His PR company represents poker sites and manages publicity for top poker players.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

In 2008 Rose was hired as spokesperson and performer for [[Dos Equis]] in the "Jim Rose Most Interesting Show In The World" U.S tour. Rose has also served as a spokesman for [[Gordon's Gin]].

==Reception==

''[[Rolling Stone]]'' described the circus as an "absolute must-see act". ''[[The Independent]]'' praised the show as "brutally comic", adding that Rose "plays the highly-strung audience like a violin". ''[[Melody Maker]]'' compared the "revolted amusement" of the audience to that of tourists at a bullfight.

British Circus proprietor [[Gerry Cottle]] said, "I've seen a lot of things in my time. I must see 40 circuses a year, but this lot... They came on in their street clothes and then... They're beyond anything I've ever seen. They shocked me." ''[[The Times Magazine]]'' said that while it may not be everyone's idea of entertainment, it certainly did not deserve to be banned.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

'''Lore Lorentz''' (12 September 1920 – 22 February 1994) was a German cabaret artist/standup comedian.&lt;ref name=r1/&gt;

She was born in Mährisch-Ostrau in [[Austria-Hungary]] (today [[Ostrava]] in the [[Czech Republic]]), as '''Lore Schirmer'''. She studied history, German literature and philosophy in [[Berlin]] and [[Vienna]]. In Berlin she met [[Kay Lorentz]], who became her husband in 1944.&lt;ref name=r1&gt;[http://hdg.de/lemo/html/biografien/LorentzLore/index.html Lore Lorentz]. Stiftung Haus der Geschichte der Bundesrepublik Deutschland&lt;/ref&gt;

Together they founded the famous "[[Kom(m)ödchen]]" in [[Düsseldorf]] in 1947. It was one of the first political cabarets in Western Germany after the Second World War.&lt;ref name=r1/&gt;

Until 1983 Lore and Kay Lorentz were not only the heads of the Kommödchen, they were part of the ensemble at the same time.
From 1983, she started with solo programs. One of her most famous programs consisted exclusively of texts written by [[Heinrich Heine]]; even though he had written them more than a century before Lorentz' program was performed, they all referred to current topics. 

Starting 1976 she taught at the [[chanson]] and [[music]] at [[Folkwang Hochschule]].&lt;ref name=r1/&gt;

She received several prizes:
*1981: Ehrenpreis des Deutschen Kleinkunstpreises
*1986: Staatspreis des Landes Nordrhein-Westfalen
*1989: Großer Kulturpreis der Sparkassenstiftung des Rheinischen Sparkassen- und Giroverbandes

Kay and Lore Lorentz rejected the [[Bundesverdienstkreuz]] (Federal Cross of Merit) in 1976.

She died in 1994 in Düsseldorf of pneumonia.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2317">In [[Argentina]] and other [[South America]]n countries, a '''''matinée''''' (also spelled '''matiné''') is a [[discothèque]] open to [[Adolescence|teenagers]] (usually between 14 and 18) before midnight. It was introduced in the 1990s because laws prohibited young people from going to dance in [[bar]]s and [[nightclub]]s that served [[alcoholic drink]]s.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}

Throughout the 20th century up to the 1980s, the word ''matinée'' was used in Argentina for the first [[film]] exhibition of the day, usually around 2 p.m. and often intended for children.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} A ''matinée'' would usually feature a [[double feature]] of two films, with a live performance in between (usually a singer or comedy act) in the early decades of the century.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}

A [[loanword]] to Spanish from French word ''matinée'' (in turn from the French ''matin'': 'morning'), the word was used in France (although not in its literal sense) to contrast from ''soirée'' (from ''soir'': 'evening') and from ''nuit'' ('night').&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://etimologias.dechile.net/?matine.-|title=Matiné|last=Vicente|first=Philippe|date=n.d.|website=Diccionario Etimológico español en linéa|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=November 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==
The usual age range is 14 to 18,{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} although some clubs admit 13-year-olds.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} The official schedule established by the [[Government of Argentina]] is from 8 p.m. to midnight;{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} in some provinces, the clubs must close by 11:30.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} The law prohibits smoking and alcoholic drinks.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} In practice, smoking is widespread.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} To circumvent the prohibition of alcohol, many young people drink at a friend's house or in a nearby park before heading to the matinee.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} Youngsters in Argentina call this the ''pre-boliche'' ("before the club").{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}

'''''Money No Enough 2''''' ({{zh|s=钱不够用二|p=Qián bùgòu yòng èr|c=|t=錢不夠用二}}) is a Singaporean film written and directed by [[Jack Neo]] and produced by Neo Studios, [[Mediacorp Raintree Pictures]] and [[Scorpio East Pictures]].

Ten years since the first ''[[Money No Enough]]'', local celebrity director [[Jack Neo]]’s ''Money No Enough 2'' returns to bring attention to the common man’s life in [[Singapore]] where the pursuit of money is a never ending passion. Short followed by a sequel House Got Ghost

==Plot==
{{Tone|date=September 2008}}
The story revolves around three brothers from a middle-income background in contemporary Singapore. These are characters who are representative of the business owners, white and blue collar workers of Singaporeans.

The oldest brother Yang Bao Hui (by Henry Thia) represents the lower income group. As a child, Hui left school at an early age to earn money to help support his poverty stricken family. He has been working as a delivery man in the same company for the last 30 years. At the persuasion of his youngest brother, he strikes out as an entrepreneur to sell health supplements. As business improves, Bao Hui quits his dead-end job and puts all his time into the business. Unfortunately the business is forced to a standstill when the health supplement is deemed unsafe for public consumption, which inadvertently brings Bao Hui close to financial ruin.

The second brother Yang Bao Qiang (by Jack Neo) portrays a well-heeled successful businessman. As the owner of his own business, he and his wife flaunts their wealth in typical Singaporean fashion, with designer clothes, a flashy car and a big house to put it all in. However in a moment of greed, Bao Qiang allows himself to be cheated out of his fortune and gets into a very difficult financial situation.

The youngest brother Yang Bao Huang (by Mark Lee) represents the ordinary middle working class. He earns a good salary working as a multi-level marketing regional supervisor for a health supplement trading company, and spends lavishly to maintain his ‘wannabe’ lifestyle. When the health supplement business goes bust, debts pile up and Bao Huang too, faces financial ruin. Even his wife gets involved, having their relationship soured and taking the blame for Bao Huang for a crime which she gets convicted for.

As the winds of fortune changes, the brothers begin to neglect their elderly mother. It was easy to be generous and filial during the good times but when household budgets tighten, what is the cost of true filial piety? Even the most basic arrangements, including whom their mother should stay with, becomes a contentious issue.

The families of each brother also try their luck at helping to earn an income to support. Unfortunately while out on the road with their [[getai]] lady boss rushing to another performance, a car accident occurs and Bao Qiang's wife and daughter are involved.

Bao Qiang's daughter turns out to be in critical condition unless she gets a blood transplant. The brothers' mother too, is in the same hospital. Coincidentally, the same type of blood was required to save both granddaughter and grandmother. The hospital so happened to have only one bag of the required blood, which a scuffle happens between everyone to decide who gets the treatment first.

Knowing the situation, the brother's mother overhears the commotion and sacrifices herself, to save her granddaughter, a younger generation whom she feels deserved to live more than herself as her time already drew near.

Much later, Bao Huang's wife is released, and the entire family is more well-off as they strike first place in a lottery draw. They give offerings to their mother, thinking that she helped them financially for all her life, whether deceased or living.

The film ends as the entire family enjoys their new start of life and the three brothers learn of their lesson.

A mini-sequel was filmed and featured in the omnibus horror movie by Jack Neo, [[Where Got Ghost?]].

It is the [[Hungry Ghost Festival|Seventh Lunar Month]] and three brothers - Bao Qiang, Bao Huang and Bao Hui - all pay respects to their deceased mother. They complain bitterly to their mother that they are doing poorly financially, and that their mother is not assisting them supernaturally. Soon afterwards, however, strange things begin to happen at their homes. The brothers all claim to see or hear their mother on numerous occasions. After hearing that parents dying in the night will bring bad luck to their children, Bao Qiang and Bao Huang overrule Bao Hui and urge him to bring their mother's remains to a temple.

Bao Hui attempts to bring their mother's urn and tablet to a temple, but is shocked to find it reappearing in his car later. He immediately calls his brothers to accompany him, but they think he is overreacting.

During a car journey from [[Malaysia]], the ghostly apparition of their mother suddenly appears on the road before them, causing Bao Huang to swerve and nearly crash off a cliff. Fortunately, the brothers manage to crawl out unscathed. As they wonder over their mother's sudden appearance, they witness a massive [[landslide]] along the road ahead. By causing them to swerve, their mother actually saved their lives.

'''Mr. Sowerberry''' is a [[fictional character]] who appears as a weak antagonist in the [[Charles Dickens]] novel ''[[Oliver Twist]]''. He is an undertaker and coffin maker who owns and operates a small dark shop in a small town some 75 miles from [[London]]. This shop also serves as a dwelling for himself, his wife, a maidservant named Charlotte, an assistant named Noah Claypole, and, for a short period, as an apprentice, the protagonist of the novel, Master [[Oliver Twist (character)|Oliver Twist]].

==Description==

In the novel Sowerberry is described as a "''tall gaunt, large jointed man, attired in a suit of threadbare black, with darned cotton stockings of the same colour, and shoes to answer''." The various stage and screen adaptations of the novel do their best to interpret this description in the guise of an older male. Funerary practices and social customs of the time add depth to this character sometimes presenting him as a weak, miserly, menacing and unwelcomed dark spectre.

Although portrayed somewhat humorously in the musical adaptation of the novel, particularly in his feigning subservience to Mrs. Sowerberry, Mr. Sowerberry is nonetheless a miser who, despite what wealth he has acquired over the years, does very little to improve the squalid lives of those around him simply because he believes it is the job of others and is therefore none of his concern. In the scene where he visits the home of a destitute family whose mother has died, there is no overt callousness, it is merely a job and nothing more.

==The Character==
[[File:Sowerberry.jpg|thumb|The Beadle spruiks the benefits of apprenticing a Workhouse boy to Mr Sowerberry. (Image - Project Gutenberg)]]

Dickens created Sowerberry's name and character from his observation of living examples in the society in which he lived.&lt;ref&gt;Perdue, David (c2014). ''Charles Dickens Page''. Retrieved on 14 May 2014 from http://charlesdickenspage.com/characters.html&lt;/ref&gt; Dickens had extensive knowledge of London street life; of the 'real' poor and 'false' rich. His novels are full of characters with odd sounding names which in reality assist the reader in visualizing the character itself. For example a 'sour berry' may make the reader grimace or think of something unpalatable, stale or stagnant. In the novel, Dickens creates an image of the undertaker we have come to recognize so well as represented in the modern media:&lt;ref&gt;Rawlinson, Richardson (2013) Bah humbug! Blame Dickens for undertaker-phobia. (blog entry) Retrieved on 14 May 2014 from http://www.goodfuneralguide.co.uk/2013/08/bah-humbug-blame-dickens-for-undertaker-phobia&lt;/ref&gt; an older tallish, thin man wearing all black, the costume of his trade. But, as a contrast, there are also moments in the novel where he appears benevolent or doting, almost genial.

Dickens includes at least two similar characters in other novels for comparison. In [[Martin Chuzzlewit]] the undertaker is known as Mr. Mould, a balding elderly man in a black suit with, "...a face in which a queer attempt at melancholy was at odds with a smirk of satisfaction..." Mr. Omer in [[David Copperfield]] is presented as,"...a merry little old man in black, with rusty little bunches of ribbons at the knees of his breeches, black stockings and a broad brimmed hat..."

==Middle class attitudes==

[[File:The Writings of Charles Dickens v4 p46 (engraving).jpg|thumb|Oliver in Sowerberry's shop, by [[George Cruikshank]].]]

Sowerberry is representative of a stereotype typical to the English [[Georgian period]] and [[Victorian era]] of the 19th century, and to his trade. It is likely he belonged to the lower middle class of business owners. Their sole aim was to keep themselves in reasonable comfort as compared to the poorer classes of the time, to protect what reputations they had and retain a little money in their pockets. When Oliver is presented to him as an apprentice his thoughts are on what profit could be made from taking the boy rather than on what was best for his up-bringing.

Typical to its historical era the mourning period after the death of a loved one was an important social custom that entailed certain protocols as did the [[funeral]] itself.&lt;ref&gt;Alirangues Loretta M. Funerary in the Victorian Era Practices. (e-zine) Retrieved on a4 May 2014 from http://www.morbidoutlook.com/nonfiction/articles/2003_04_vicdeath.html&lt;/ref&gt; Specially designed black clothing, a slow moving funeral cortege, even paid mourners at the graveside, were features offered by most city undertakers. Dickens found much of this a mockery as he later commented on in his journal [[Household Words]] describing such practices as "grotesque" and "exaggerated".&lt;ref&gt;Dickens. ''Household Words Volume 1 (1850).'' (p.78) Retrieved on 14 May 2014 from http://www.djo.org.uk/household-words/volume-i/page-78.html&lt;/ref&gt; The pointless expense was further highlighted by him when he described the role of the mute in his novel [[Martin Chuzzlewit]], "...Two mutes were at the house door, looking as mournful as could reasonably be expected of men with such a thriving job in hand..."

==Film, theatre and television==

English adaptations of the novel have included numerous actors, some well known, in the character of Mr. Sowerberry. The earliest known motion picture version of [[Frank Lloyd|Frank Lloyd's]] 1922 production placed the American actor [[Nelson McDowell]] in the role. [[David Lean]] created some very atmospheric settings in his movie version ''[[Oliver Twist (1948 film)|Oliver Twist]]'' which featured [[Gibb McLaughlin]] as Mr. Sowerberry.

With the advent of television it was inevitable that the classic tale become a [[miniseries]] and in 1962 the [[BBC]] enlisted the talents of [[Donald Eccles]] to play the role of the undertaker.

In 1960 the novel Oliver Twist was further adapted by [[Lionel Bart]] as the musical [[Oliver!]] which premiered in the West End. The original cast included the Australian, [[Barry Humphries]] in the role. It gave the character a first-name of Henry and was a minor singing role featuring the song, 'That's Your Funeral'.&lt;ref&gt;Bart, Lionel (1994). ''Oliver!.'' (Revised 1994) London, Oliver Productions Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Oliver!'' was brought to Broadway in 1963 and later revived in 1984.

Following the success of the theatrical musical presentation a motion picture version of that adaptation was produced in 1968 with [[Leonard Rossiter]] as Mr. Sowerberry. In this portrayal the undertakers cool, and sometimes cruel traits, are largely underplayed and are replaced by his fondness for intoxicating drink. This is in line with Bart's adaptation of the original novel.

In the 1982 made-for-TV movie version, Mr. Sowerberry is portrayed by [[Philip Locke]] and three years later by [[Raymond Witch]] in another BBC series.

In 1994, ''[[Oliver!]]'' was revived at the Palladium Theatre in London and again in 2009.

[[Roger Lloyd-Pack]] played Sowerberry in the [[ITV Network]] miniseries of the Dickens novel in 1999.

2005, [[Roman Polanski]] production enlisted the services of Michael Heath as the undertaker.

In the 2007 [[BBC]] television adaptation he is played by [[John Sessions]].

In December 2008, ''[[Oliver!]]'' was revived at the [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]], London with [[Julian Bleach]] playing both Sowerberry and Grimwig.

And so it goes on, the adaptation by Bart continues to play in both large well known theatres and small auditoriums around the world.

The '''National Youth Arts Festival''' was the [[United Kingdom]]s leading participatory non-competitive arts event for young people. In 1995 over 1500 young people took part, involving 56 groups from all over the UK. Throughout the 1990s the events were held in the [[North Devon]] town of [[Ilfracombe]].
It was preceded by the Channel Arts Youth Festival, a popular international cultural event in the 1980s. The event included contributions from theatre groups nationwide, as well as Dutch clog dancing and African Tribal Dancing.

The '''neuroscience of music''' is the scientific study of brain-based mechanisms involved in the cognitive processes underlying [[music]]. These behaviours include music [[listening]], [[Performance|performing]], [[Musical composition|composing]], reading, writing, and ancillary activities. It also is increasingly concerned with the brain basis for [[Aesthetics of music|musical aesthetics]] and musical emotion. Scientists working in this field may have training in cognitive neuroscience, [[neurology]], [[neuroanatomy]], [[psychology]], [[music theory]], [[computer science]], and other relevant fields.

The cognitive neuroscience of music represents a significant branch of [[music psychology]], and is distinguished from related fields such as [[cognitive musicology]] in its reliance on direct observations of the brain and use of such techniques as [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI), [[transcranial magnetic stimulation]] (TMS), [[magnetoencephalography]] (MEG), [[electroencephalography]] (EEG), and [[positron emission tomography]] (PET).

== Neurological bases ==

===Pitch===
Successive parts of the [[tonotopy|tonotopically]] organized [[basilar membrane]] in the [[cochlea]] resonate to corresponding [[frequency]] [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidths]] of incoming sound. The [[hair cell]]s in the cochlea release [[neurotransmitter]] as a result, causing [[action potentials]] down the [[auditory nerve]]. The auditory nerve then leads to several layers of [[synapses]] at numerous [[Nucleus (neuroanatomy)|nuclei]] in the [[Auditory system#Central auditory system|auditory brainstem]]. These nuclei are also tonotopically organized, and the process of achieving this tonotopy after the cochlea is not well understood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/nn.2332 |title=Tonotopic reorganization of developing auditory brainstem circuits |year=2009 |last1=Kandler |first1=Karl |last2=Clause |first2=Amanda |last3=Noh |first3=Jihyun |journal=Nature Neuroscience |volume=12 |issue=6 |pages=711–7 |pmid=19471270 |pmc=2780022}}&lt;/ref&gt; This tonotopy is in general maintained up to [[primary auditory cortex]] in [[mammals]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0013-4694(82)90118-3 |title=Cortical magnetic fields evoked by frequency glides of a continuous tone |year=1982 |last1=Arlinger |first1=S |last2=Elberling |first2=C |last3=Bak |first3=C |last4=Kofoed |first4=B |last5=Lebech |first5=J |last6=Saermark |first6=K |journal=Electroencephalography and Clinical Neurophysiology |volume=54 |issue=6 |pages=642–53 |pmid=6183097}}&lt;/ref&gt; however it is often found that cells in primary and non-primary auditory cortex have [[Spatio temporal receptive field|spatio-temporal receptive fields]], rather than being strictly responsive or phase-locking their action potentials to narrow frequency regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/cercor/11.3.183 |title=Feature Article: The Structure and Function of Dynamic Cortical and Thalamic Receptive Fields |year=2001 |last1=Ghazanfar |first1=A.

A widely postulated mechanism for pitch processing in the early central auditory system is the [[Circle map|phase-locking]] and [[Arnold tongue#Mode locking|mode-locking]] of action potentials to frequencies in a stimulus. Phase-locking to stimulus frequencies has been shown in the auditory nerve,&lt;ref name="Koppl 1997 3312–3321"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Köppl |first1=Christine |title=Phase Locking to High Frequencies in the Auditory Nerve and Cochlear Nucleus Magnocellularis of the Barn Owl, ''Tyto alba'' |journal=Journal of Neuroscience |pmid=9096164 |url=http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=9096164 |year=1997 |volume=17 |issue=9 |pages=3312–21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1152/jn.00326.2006 |title=Phase Locking of Auditory-Nerve Fibers to the Envelopes of High-Frequency Sounds: Implications for Sound Localization |year=2006 |last1=Dreyer |first1=A. |last2=Delgutte |first2=B. |journal=Journal of Neurophysiology |volume=96 |issue=5 |pages=2327–41 |pmid=16807349 |pmc=2013745}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[cochlear nucleus]],&lt;ref name="Koppl 1997 3312–3321"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1152/jn.00070.2009 |title=Mode-Locked Spike Trains in Responses of Ventral Cochlear Nucleus Chopper and Onset Neurons to Periodic Stimuli |year=2009 |last1=Laudanski |first1=J. |last2=Coombes |first2=S. |last3=Palmer |first3=A.

=== Melody processing in the secondary auditory cortex ===

Studies suggest that individuals are capable of automatically detecting a difference or anomaly in a [[melody]] such as an out of tune [[pitch (music)|pitch]] which does not fit with their previous music experience. This automatic processing occurs in the secondary auditory cortex. Brattico, Tervaniemi, Naatanen, and Peretz (2006) performed one such study to determine if the detection of tones that do not fit an individual's expectations can occur automatically.&lt;ref name="Brattico"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.brainres.2006.08.023 |title=Musical scale properties are automatically processed in the human auditory cortex |year=2006 |last1=Brattico |first1=Elvira |last2=Tervaniemi |first2=Mari |last3=Näätänen |first3=Risto |last4=Peretz |first4=Isabelle |journal=Brain Research |volume=1117 |pages=162–74 |pmid=16963000 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; They recorded [[event-related potential]]s (ERPs) in nonmusicians as they were presented unfamiliar melodies with either an out of tune pitch or an out of key pitch while participants were either distracted from the sounds or attending to the melody. Both conditions revealed an early frontal negativity independent of where attention was directed. This negativity originated in the auditory cortex, more precisely in the supratemporal lobe (which corresponds with the secondary auditory cortex) with greater activity from the right hemisphere. The negativity response was larger for pitch that was out of tune than that which was out of key. Ratings of musical incongruity were higher for out of tune pitch melodies than for out of key pitch.  In the focused attention condition, out of key and out of tune pitches produced late parietal positivity. The findings of Brattico et al. (2006) suggest that there is automatic and rapid processing of melodic properties in the secondary auditory cortex.&lt;ref name="Brattico"/&gt; The findings that pitch incongruities were detected automatically, even in processing unfamiliar melodies, suggests that there is an automatic comparison of incoming information with long term knowledge of musical scale properties, such as culturally influenced rules of musical properties (common chord progressions, scale patterns, etc.) and individual expectations of how the melody should proceed. The auditory area processes the sound of the music. The auditory area is located in the temporal lobe. The temporal lobe deals with the recognition and perception of auditory stimuli, memory, and speech (Kinser, 2012).

=== Role of right auditory cortex in fine pitch resolution ===

[[File:Brodmann 41 42.png|right|250px|thumb|The [[primary auditory cortex]] is one of the main areas associated with superior pitch resolution.]]

The right secondary auditory cortex has finer pitch resolution than the left. Hyde, Peretz and Zatorre (2008) used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in their study to test the involvement of right and left auditory cortical regions in frequency processing of melodic sequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2007.09.004 |title=Evidence for the role of the right auditory cortex in fine pitch resolution |year=2008 |last1=Hyde |first1=Krista L. |last2=Peretz |first2=Isabelle |last3=Zatorre |first3=Robert J. |journal=Neuropsychologia |volume=46 |issue=2 |pages=632–9 |pmid=17959204}}&lt;/ref&gt; As well as finding superior pitch resolution in the right secondary auditory cortex, specific areas found to be involved were the [[planum temporale]] (PT) in the secondary auditory cortex, and the [[primary auditory cortex]] in the medial section of Heschl's gyrus (HG).

Many neuroimaging studies have found evidence of the importance of right secondary auditory regions in aspects of musical pitch processing, such as melody.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0896-6273(02)01060-7 |title=The Processing of Temporal Pitch and Melody Information in Auditory Cortex |year=2002 |last1=Patterson |first1=Roy D |last2=Uppenkamp |first2=Stefan |last3=Johnsrude |first3=Ingrid S |last4=Griffiths |first4=Timothy D |journal=Neuron |volume=36 |issue=4 |pages=767–76 |pmid=12441063}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these studies such as one by Patterson, Uppenkamp, Johnsrude and Griffiths (2002) also find evidence of a hierarchy of pitch processing. Patterson et al. (2002) used spectrally matched sounds which produced: no pitch, fixed pitch or melody in an fMRI study and found that all conditions activated HG and PT. Sounds with pitch activated more of these regions than sounds without. When a melody was produced activation spread to the [[superior temporal gyrus]] (STG) and planum polare (PP). These results support the existence of a pitch processing hierarchy.

===Rhythm===
The belt and parabelt areas of the right hemisphere are involved in processing [[rhythm]]. When individuals are preparing to tap out a rhythm of regular intervals (1:2 or 1:3) the left [[frontal cortex]], left [[parietal cortex]], and right [[cerebellum]] are all activated.  With more difficult rhythms such as a 1:2.5, more areas in the cerebral cortex and cerebellum are involved.&lt;ref name="Tramo"&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.1126/science.10.1126/science.1056899|title=BIOLOGY AND MUSIC: Enhanced: Music of the Hemispheres |year=2001 |last1=Tramo |first1=M. J. |journal=Science |volume=291 |issue=5501 |pages=54–6 |pmid=11192009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[EEG]] recordings have also shown a relationship between brain electrical activity and rhythm perception. Snyder and Large (2005)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.cogbrainres.2004.12.014 |title=Gamma-band activity reflects the metric structure of rhythmic tone sequences |year=2005 |last1=Snyder |first1=Joel S. |last2=Large |first2=Edward W. |journal=Cognitive Brain Research |volume=24 |pages=117–26 |pmid=15922164 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; performed a study examining rhythm perception in human subjects, finding that activity in the [[gamma wave|gamma band]] (20 – 60&amp;nbsp;Hz) corresponds to the [[Beat (music)|beats]] in a simple rhythm. Two types of gamma activity were found by Snyder &amp; Large: induced gamma activity, and [[Evoked potential#Auditory evoked potential|evoked]] gamma activity. Evoked gamma activity was found after the onset of each tone in the rhythm; this activity was found to be phase-locked (peaks and troughs were directly related to the exact onset of the tone) and did not appear when a gap (missed beat) was present in the rhythm. Induced gamma activity, which was not found to be phase-locked, was also found to correspond with each beat. However, induced gamma activity did not subside when a gap was present in the rhythm, indicating that induced gamma activity may possibly serve as a sort of internal metronome independent of auditory input. The motor and auditory areas are located in the cerebrum of the brain.  The motor area processes the rhythm of the music (Dean, 2013).{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}}  The motor area of the brain is located in the parietal lobe. The parietal lobe also deals with orientation, recognition, and perception.

===Tonality===
[[Tonality]] describes the relationships between the elements of melody and [[harmony]] – tones, [[Interval (music)|intervals]], [[Chord (music)|chords]], and [[Scale (music)|scales]]. These relationships are often characterised as hierarchical, such that one of the elements dominates or attracts another. They occur both within and between every type of element, creating a rich and time-varying percept between tones and their melodic, harmonic, and [[Chromatic scale|chromatic]] contexts. In one conventional sense, tonality refers to just the [[Major scale|major]] and [[Minor scale|minor]] scale types – examples of scales whose elements are capable of maintaining a consistent set of functional relationships. The most important functional relationship is that of the [[Tonic (music)|tonic]] note and the tonic chord with the rest of the scale. The tonic is the element which tends to assert its dominance and attraction over all others, and it functions as the ultimate point of attraction, rest and resolution for the scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Krumhansl |first=Carol |title=Cognitive Foundations of Musical Pitch |year=1990 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York |isbn=978-0-19-514836-7}}{{page needed|date=November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The right auditory cortex is primarily involved in perceiving  pitch, and parts of harmony, melody and rhythm.&lt;ref name="Tramo"/&gt; One study by Petr Janata found that there are tonality-sensitive areas in the [[medial prefrontal cortex]], the [[cerebellum]], the [[Superior temporal sulcus|superior temporal sulci]] of both hemispheres and the [[Superior temporal gyrus|superior temporal gyri]] (which has a skew towards the right hemisphere).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.1076262 |title=The Cortical Topography of Tonal Structures Underlying Western Music |year=2002 |last1=Janata |first1=P. |journal=Science |volume=298 |issue=5601 |pages=2167–70 |pmid=12481131 |last2=Birk |first2=JL |last3=Van Horn |first3=JD |last4=Leman |first4=M |last5=Tillmann |first5=B |last6=Bharucha |first6=JJ|bibcode = 2002Sci...298.2167J }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music production and performance==

===Motor control functions===

Musical performance usually involves at least three elementary motor control functions: timing, sequencing, and spatial organization of motor movements.  Accuracy in timing of movements is related to musical rhythm. Rhythm, the pattern of temporal intervals within a musical measure or [[musical phrase|phrase]], in turn creates the perception of stronger and weaker beats.&lt;ref name= Zatorre&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zatorre | first1 = R. J. | last2 = Halpern | first2 = A. R. | year = 2005 | title = Mental concerts: musical imagery and auditory cortex | url = | journal = Neuron | volume = 47 | issue = | pages = 9–12 | doi=10.1016/j.neuron.2005.06.013 | pmid=15996544}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sequencing and spatial organization relate to the expression of individual notes on a [[musical instrument]].

These functions and their neural mechanisms have been investigated separately in many studies, but little is known about their combined interaction in producing a complex musical performance.&lt;ref name="Zatorre"/&gt;  The study of music requires examining them together.

====Timing====
Although neural mechanisms involved in timing movement have been studied rigorously over the past 20 years, much remains controversial.  The ability to phrase movements in precise time has been accredited to a neural [[metronome]] or clock mechanism where time is represented through oscillations or pulses.&lt;ref name= Buhusi &gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Buhusi | first1 = C.

[[Functional neuroimaging]] studies, as well as studies of brain-damaged patients, have linked movement timing to several [[Cerebral cortex|cortical]] and sub-cortical regions, including the [[cerebellum]], [[basal ganglia]] and [[supplementary motor area]] (SMA).&lt;ref name="Zatorre"/&gt; Specifically the basal ganglia and possibly the SMA have been implicated in interval timing at longer timescales (1 second and above), while the cerebellum may be more important for controlling motor timing at shorter timescales (milliseconds).&lt;ref name="Buhusi"/&gt;&lt;ref name= Lewis&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lewis | first1 = P. A. | last2 = Miall | first2 = R. C. | year = 2003 | title = Distinct systems for automatic and cognitively controlled time measurement: evidence from neuroimaging | url = | journal = Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. | volume = 13 | issue = | pages = 250–255 | doi=10.1016/s0959-4388(03)00036-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, these results indicate that motor timing is not controlled by a single brain region, but by a network of regions that control specific parameters of movement and that depend on the relevant timescale of the rhythmic sequence.&lt;ref name="Zatorre"/&gt;

====Sequencing====
Motor sequencing has been explored in terms of either the ordering of individual movements, such as finger sequences for key presses, or the coordination of subcomponents of complex multi-joint movements.&lt;ref name="Zatorre"/&gt; Implicated in this process are various cortical and sub-cortical regions, including the basal ganglia, the SMA and the pre-SMA, the cerebellum, and the premotor and prefrontal cortices, all involved in the production and learning of motor sequences but without explicit evidence of their specific contributions or interactions amongst one another.&lt;ref name="Zatorre"/&gt; In animals, neurophysiological studies have demonstrated an interaction between the frontal cortex and the basal ganglia during the learning of movement sequences.&lt;ref name= Graybiel&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Graybiel | first1 = A.

Chunking, defined as the re-organization or re-grouping of movement sequences into smaller sub-sequences during performance, is thought to facilitate the smooth performance of complex movements and to improve [[motor memory]].&lt;ref name="Zatorre"/&gt;  
Lastly, the premotor cortex has been shown to be involved in tasks that require the production of relatively complex sequences, and it may contribute to motor prediction.&lt;ref name= Janata&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Janata | first1 = P. | last2 = Grafton | first2 = S.

====Spatial organization====
Few studies of complex motor control have distinguished between sequential and spatial organization, yet expert musical performances demand not only precise sequencing but also spatial organization of movements. Studies in animals and humans have established the involvement of [[parietal lobe|parietal]], sensory–motor and premotor cortices in the control of movements, when the integration of spatial, sensory and motor information is required.&lt;ref name= Johnson&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Johnson | first1 = P.

Clin. Neurophysiol. | volume = 106 | issue = | pages = 283–296 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Few studies so far have explicitly examined the role of spatial processing in the context of musical tasks.

===Auditory-motor interactions===

====Feedforward and feedback interactions====
An auditory–motor interaction may be loosely defined as any engagement of or communication between the two systems.  Two classes of auditory-motor interaction are "feedforward" and "feedback".&lt;ref name="Zatorre"/&gt;  In feedforward interactions, it is the auditory system that predominately influences the motor output, often in a predictive way.&lt;ref name= Large&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Large | first1 = E. W. | last2 = Palmer | first2 = C. | year = 2002 | title = Perceiving temporal regularity in music. | url = | journal = Cogn Sci | volume = 26 | issue = | pages = 1–37 | doi=10.1207/s15516709cog2601_1}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example is the phenomenon of tapping to the beat, where the listener anticipates the rhythmic accents in a piece of music. Another example is the effect of music on movement disorders: rhythmic auditory stimuli have been shown to improve walking ability in [[Parkinson's disease]] and [[stroke]] patients.&lt;ref name= Thaut&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Thaut | first1 = M.

Psychiatry | volume = 62 | issue = | pages = 22–26 | doi=10.1136/jnnp.62.1.22| pmc = 486690 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Feedback interactions are particularly relevant in playing an instrument such as a violin, or in singing, where pitch is variable and must be continuously controlled. If auditory feedback is blocked, musicians can still execute well-rehearsed pieces, but expressive aspects of performance are affected.&lt;ref name= Repp&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Repp | first1 = B. H. | year = 1999 | title = Effects of auditory feedback deprivation on expressive piano performance | url = | journal = Music Perception | volume = 16 | issue = | pages = 409–438 | doi=10.2307/40285802}}&lt;/ref&gt; When auditory feedback is experimentally manipulated by delays or distortions,&lt;ref name= Pfordresher&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pfordresher | first1 = P. Q. | last2 = Palmer | first2 = C. | year = 2006 | title = Effects of hearing the past, present, or future during music performance | url = | journal = Percept. Psychophys. | volume = 68 | issue = | pages = 362–376 | doi=10.3758/bf03193683}}&lt;/ref&gt; motor performance is significantly altered: asynchronous feedback disrupts the timing of events, whereas alteration of pitch information disrupts the selection of appropriate actions, but not their timing. This suggests that disruptions occur because both actions and percepts depend on a single underlying mental representation.&lt;ref name="Zatorre"/&gt;

====Models of auditory–motor interactions====
Several models of auditory–motor interactions have been advanced. The model of Hickok and Poeppel,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hickok | first1 = G. | last2 = Poeppel | first2 = D. | year = 2004 | title = Dorsal and ventral streams: a framework for understanding aspects of the functional anatomy of language | url = | journal = Cognition | volume = 92 | issue = | pages = 67–99 | doi=10.1016/j.cognition.2003.10.011 | pmid=15037127}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is specific for speech processing, proposes that a ventral auditory stream maps sounds onto meaning, whereas a dorsal stream maps sounds onto articulatory representations. They and others&lt;ref name= Scott&gt;Scott, S. K. &amp; Johnsrude, I. S. "The neuroanatomical and functional organization of speech perception. ''Trends Neurosci''. 26, 100–107 (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; suggest that posterior auditory regions at the parieto-temporal boundary are crucial parts of the auditory–motor interface, mapping auditory representations onto motor representations of speech, and onto melodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hickok | first1 = G. | last2 = Buchsbaum | first2 = B. | last3 = Humphries | first3 = C. | last4 = Muftuler | first4 = T. | year = 2003 | title = Auditory–motor interaction revealed by fMRI: speech, music, and working memory in area SPT | url = | journal = J.

====Mirror/echo neurons and auditory–motor interactions====
The [[mirror neuron]] system has an important role in neural models of sensory–motor integration. There is considerable evidence that neurons respond to both actions and the accumulated observation of actions.  A system proposed to explain this understanding of actions is that visual representations of actions are mapped onto our own motor system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rizzolatti | first1 = G. | last2 = Fogassi | first2 = L. | last3 = Gallese | first3 = V. | year = 2001 | title = Neurophysiological mechanisms underlying the understanding and imitation of action | doi = 10.1038/35090060 | journal = Nature Reviews Neuroscience| volume = 2 | issue = | pages = 661–670 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some mirror neurons are activated both by the observation of goal-directed actions, and by the associated sounds produced during the action.  This suggests that the auditory modality can access the motor system.&lt;ref name= Kohler&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kohler | first1 = E. | display-authors = etal   | year = 2002 | title = Hearing sounds, understanding actions: action representation in mirror neurons | url = | journal = Science | volume = 297 | issue = | pages = 846–848 | doi=10.1126/science.1070311 | pmid=12161656|bibcode = 2002Sci...297..846K }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= Keysers&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Keysers | first1 = C. | display-authors = etal   | year = 2003 | title = Audiovisual mirror neurons and action recognition.

Results point to a broader involvement of the dPMC and other motor areas.&lt;ref name="Zatorre"/&gt;

==Music and language==
{{See also|Musical semantics|Musical syntax}}
Certain aspects of [[language]] and melody have been shown to be processed in near identical functional brain areas.  Brown, Martinez and Parsons (2006) examined the neurological structural similarities between music and language.&lt;ref name="Brown"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1460-9568.2006.04785.x |title=Music and language side by side in the brain: A PET study of the generation of melodies and sentences |year=2006 |last1=Brown |first1=Steven |last2=Martinez |first2=Michael J. |last3=Parsons |first3=Lawrence M. |journal=European Journal of Neuroscience |volume=23 |issue=10 |pages=2791–803 |pmid=16817882}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Utilizing positron emission tomography (PET), the findings showed that both linguistic and melodic phrases produced activation in almost identical functional brain areas.  These areas included the [[primary motor cortex]], [[supplementary motor area]], [[Broca's area]], anterior insula, primary and secondary auditory cortices, temporal pole, [[basal ganglia]], ventral [[thalamus]] and posterior [[cerebellum]].  Differences were found in lateralization tendencies as language tasks favoured the left hemisphere, but the majority of activations were bilateral which produced significant overlap across modalities.&lt;ref name="Brown"/&gt;

Syntactical information mechanisms in both music and language have been shown to be processed similarly in the brain.  Jentschke, Koelsch, Sallat and Friederici (2008) conducted a study investigating the processing of music in children with [[Speech and language pathology in school settings#Specific language impairment|specific language impairments]] (SLI).&lt;ref name="Jentschke"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1162/jocn.2008.20135 |title=Children with Specific Language Impairment Also Show Impairment of Music-syntactic Processing |year=2008 |last1=Jentschke |first1=Sebastian |last2=Koelsch |first2=Stefan |last3=Sallat |first3=Stephan |last4=Friederici |first4=Angela D. |journal=Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience |volume=20 |issue=11 |pages=1940–51 |pmid=18416683}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Children with typical language development (TLD) showed ERP patterns different from  those of children with SLI, which reflected their challenges in processing music-syntactic regularities.  Strong correlations between the ERAN (''Early Right Anterior Negativity''—a specific ERP measure) amplitude and linguistic and musical abilities provide additional evidence for the relationship of syntactical processing in music and language.&lt;ref name="Jentschke"/&gt;

However, production of melody and production of speech may be subserved by different neural networks.  Stewart, Walsh, Frith and Rothwell (2001) studied the differences between speech production and song production using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS).&lt;ref name="Stewart"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.2001.tb05762.x |title=Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation Produces Speech Arrest but Not Song Arrest |year=2006 |last1=Stewart |first1=Lauren |last2=Walsh |first2=Vincent |last3=Frith |first3=UTA |last4=Rothwell |first4=John |journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences |volume=930 |pages=433–5 |pmid=11458860 |issue=1|bibcode = 2001NYASA.930..433S }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Stewart et al. found that TMS applied to the left [[frontal lobe]] disturbs speech but not melody supporting the idea that they are subserved by different areas of the brain.  The authors suggest that a reason for the difference is that speech generation can be localized well but the underlying mechanisms of melodic production cannot.  Alternatively, it was also suggested that speech production may be less robust than melodic production and thus more susceptible to interference.&lt;ref name="Stewart"/&gt;

Language processing is a function more of the left side of the brain than the right side, particularly Broca's area and [[Wernicke's area]], though the roles played by the two sides of the brain in processing different aspects of language are still unclear. Music is also processed by both the left and the right sides of the brain.&lt;ref name="Brown" /&gt;&lt;ref name="mb1"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1006/nimg.2002.1154 |title=Bach Speaks: A Cortical "Language-Network" Serves the Processing of Music |year=2002 |last1=Koelsch |first1=Stefan |last2=Gunter |first2=Thomas C. |last3=v Cramon |first3=D.Yves |last4=Zysset |first4=Stefan |last5=Lohmann |first5=Gabriele |last6=Friederici |first6=Angela D. |journal=NeuroImage |volume=17 |issue=2 |pages=956–66 |pmid=12377169}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent evidence further suggest shared processing between language and music at the conceptual level.&lt;ref name=Daltrozzo09&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1162/jocn.2009.21113 |title=Conceptual Processing in Music as Revealed by N400 Effects on Words and Musical Targets |year=2009 |last1=Daltrozzo |first1=Jérôme |last2=Schön |first2=Daniele |journal=Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience |volume=21 |issue=10 |pages=1882–92 |pmid=18823240}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been found that, among music conservatory students, the prevalence of absolute pitch is much higher for speakers of tone language, even controlling for ethnic background, showing that language influences how musical tones are perceived.&lt;ref name="phil-43"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1121/1.2151799 |title=Absolute pitch among American and Chinese conservatory students: Prevalence differences, and evidence for a speech-related critical period |year=2006 |last1=Deutsch |first1=Diana |last2=Henthorn |first2=Trevor |last3=Marvin |first3=Elizabeth |last4=Xu |first4=Hongshuai |journal=The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America |volume=119 |issue=2 |pages=719–22 |pmid=16521731|bibcode = 2006ASAJ..119..719D }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="phil-388"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1121/1.3081389 |title=Absolute pitch among students in an American music conservatory: Association with tone language fluency |year=2009 |last1=Deutsch |first1=Diana |last2=Dooley |first2=Kevin |last3=Henthorn |first3=Trevor |last4=Head |first4=Brian |journal=The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America |volume=125 |issue=4 |pages=2398–403 |pmid=19354413|bibcode = 2009ASAJ..125.2398D }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Musician vs. non-musician processing ==

[[File:Player piano keyboard.jpg|right|thumb|Professional pianists show less cortical activation for complex finger movement tasks due to structural differences in the brain.]]

=== Differences ===

Brain structure within musicians and non-musicians is distinctly different.  Gaser and Schlaug (2003) compared brain structures of professional musicians with non-musicians and discovered [[Grey matter|gray matter]] volume differences in motor, auditory and visual-spatial brain regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=14534258 |year=2003 |last1=Gaser |first1=C |last2=Schlaug |first2=G |title=Brain structures differ between musicians and non-musicians |volume=23 |issue=27 |pages=9240–5 |journal=The Journal of Neuroscience}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Specifically, positive correlations were discovered between musician status (professional, amateur and non-musician) and gray matter volume in the primary motor and [[Somatosensory system|somatosensory areas]], [[Premotor cortex|premotor areas]], anterior superior parietal areas and in the inferior temporal gyrus bilaterally.  This strong association between musician status and gray matter differences supports the notion that musicians' brains show use-dependent structural changes.&lt;ref name="DoifpsygMissing"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2011.00393 |title=Music, Neuroscience, and the Psychology of Well-Being: A Précis |year=2012 |last1=Croom |first1=Adam M. |journal=Frontiers in Psychology |volume=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the distinct differences in several brain regions, it is unlikely that these differences are innate but rather due to the long-term acquisition and repetitive rehearsal of musical skills.

Brains of musicians also show functional differences from those of non-musicians.  Krings, Topper, Foltys, Erberich, Sparing, Willmes and Thron (2000) utilized fMRI to study brain area involvement of professional pianists and a control group while performing complex finger movements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0304-3940(99)00930-1 |title=Cortical activation patterns during complex motor tasks in piano players and control subjects. A functional magnetic resonance imaging study |year=2000 |last1=Krings |first1=Timo |last2=Töpper |first2=Rudolf |last3=Foltys |first3=Henrik |last4=Erberich |first4=Stephan |last5=Sparing |first5=Roland |last6=Willmes |first6=Klaus |last7=Thron |first7=Armin |journal=Neuroscience Letters |volume=278 |issue=3 |pages=189–93 |pmid=10653025}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Krings et al. found that the professional piano players showed lower levels of cortical activation in motor areas of the brain.  It was concluded that a lesser amount of neurons needed to be activated for the piano players due to long-term motor practice which results in the different cortical activation patterns.  Koeneke, Lutz, Wustenberg and Jancke (2004) reported similar findings in keyboard players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1097/01.wnr.0000127463.10147.e7 |title=Long-term training affects cerebellar processing in skilled keyboard players |year=2004 |last1=Koeneke |first1=Susan |last2=Lutz |first2=Kai |last3=Wüstenberg |first3=Torsten |last4=Jäncke |first4=Lutz |journal=NeuroReport |volume=15 |issue=8 |pages=1279–82 |pmid=15167549}}&lt;/ref&gt; Skilled keyboard players and a control group performed complex tasks involving unimanual and bimanual finger movements. During task conditions, strong hemodynamic responses in the cerebellum were shown by both non-musicians and keyboard players, but non-musicians showed the stronger response. This finding indicates that different cortical activation patterns emerge from long-term motor practice. This evidence supports previous data showing that musicians require fewer neurons to perform the same movements.

Musicians have been shown to have significantly more developed left planum temporales, and have also shown to have a greater word memory.&lt;ref&gt;(Chan et al.){{full citation needed|date=November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chan's study controlled for age, grade point average and years of education and found that when given a 16 word memory test, the musicians averaged one to two more words above their non musical counterparts.

=== Similarities ===

Studies have shown that the human brain has an implicit musical ability.&lt;ref name="KoelschGunter"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1162/089892900562183 |title=Brain Indices of Music Processing: "Nonmusicians" are Musical |year=2000 |last1=Koelsch |first1=Stefan |last2=Gunter |first2=Tomas |last3=Friederici |first3=Angela D. |last4=Schröger |first4=Erich |journal=Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience |volume=12 |issue=3 |pages=520–41 |pmid=10931776}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="KoelschSchroger"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/1469-8986.3910038 |title=Music matters: Preattentive musicality of the human brain |year=2002 |last1=Koelsch |first1=Stefan |last2=Schroger |first2=Erich |last3=Gunter |first3=Thomas C. |journal=Psychophysiology |volume=39 |pages=38–48 |pmid=12206294 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Koelsch, Gunter, Friederici and Schoger (2000) investigated the influence of preceding musical context, task relevance of unexpected [[Chord (music)|chord]]s and the degree of probability of violation on music processing in both musicians and non-musicians.&lt;ref name="KoelschGunter"/&gt; Findings showed that the human brain unintentionally extrapolates expectations about impending auditory input. Even in non-musicians, the extrapolated expectations are consistent with music theory.  The ability to process information musically supports the idea of an implicit musical ability in the human brain.  In a follow-up study, Koelsch, Schroger, and Gunter (2002) investigated whether ERAN and N5 could be evoked preattentively in non-musicians.&lt;ref name="KoelschSchroger"/&gt; Findings showed that both ERAN and N5 can be elicited even in a situation where the musical stimulus is ignored by the listener indicating that there is a highly differentiated preattentive musicality in the human brain.

== Gender differences ==

Minor neurological differences regarding hemispheric processing exist between brains of males and females.  Koelsch, Maess, Grossmann and Friederici (2003) investigated music processing through EEG and ERPs and discovered gender differences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1097/00001756-200304150-00010 |title=Electric brain responses reveal gender differences in music processing |year=2003 |last1=Koelsch |first1=Stefan |last2=Maess |first2=Burkhard |last3=Grossmann |first3=Tobias |last4=Friederici |first4=Angela D. |journal=NeuroReport |volume=14 |issue=5 |pages=709–13 |pmid=12692468}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Findings showed that females process music information bilaterally and males process music with a right-hemispheric predominance.  However, the early negativity of males was also present over the left hemisphere.  This indicates that males do not exclusively utilize the right hemisphere for musical information processing.  In a follow-up study, Koelsch, Grossman, Gunter, Hahne, Schroger and Friederici (2003)  found that boys show lateralization of the early anterior negativity in the left hemisphere but found a bilateral effect in girls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1162/jocn.2003.15.5.683 |title=Children Processing Music: Electric Brain Responses Reveal Musical Competence and Gender Differences |year=2003 |last1=Koelsch |first1=Stefan |last2=Grossmann |first2=Tobias |last3=Gunter |first3=Thomas C. |last4=Hahne |first4=Anja |last5=Schröger |first5=Erich |last6=Friederici |first6=Angela D. |journal=Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience |volume=15 |issue=5 |pages=683–93 |pmid=12965042}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This indicates a developmental effect as early negativity is lateralized in the right hemisphere in men and in the left hemisphere in boys.

== Handedness differences ==

It has been found that subjects who are lefthanded, particularly those who are also ambidextrous, perform better than righthanders on short term memory for the pitch.&lt;ref name="phil-4"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.622558 |title=Pitch memory: An advantage for the left-handed | volume=199 | issue=4328 |journal=Science |pages=559–560 |pmid=622558 |date=February 1978|bibcode = 1978Sci...199..559D  | last1 = Deutsch | first1 = D}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="phil-25"&gt;{{cite book |last=Deutsch |first=Diana |chapter=Handedness and Memory for Tonal Pitch |editor1-first=Jeannine |editor1-last=Herron |title=Neuropsychology of Lefthandedness |pages=263–71 |year=1980 |chapterurl=http://philomel.com/pdf/Ch-Handedness-1980.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It was hypothesized that this handedness advantage is due to the fact that lefthanders have more duplication of storage in the two hemispheres than do righthanders. Other work has shown that there are pronounced differences between righthanders and lefthanders (on a statistical basis) in how musical patterns are perceived, when sounds come from different regions of space.  This has been found, for example, in the [[Octave illusion]]&lt;ref name="phil-85"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/251307a0 |title=An auditory illusion |year=1974 |last1=Deutsch |first1=Diana |journal=Nature |volume=251 |issue=5473 |pages=307–9 |pmid=4427654|bibcode = 1974Natur.251..307D }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="phil-2"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0028-3932(83)90047-7 |title=The octave illusion in relation to handedness and familial handedness background |year=1983 |last1=Deutsch |first1=Diana |journal=Neuropsychologia |volume=21 |issue=3 |pages=289–93 |pmid=6877583}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Scale illusion]].&lt;ref name="phil-6"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1121/1.380573 |title=Two-channel listening to musical scales |year=1975 |last1=Deutsch |first1=Diana |journal=The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America |volume=57 |issue=5 |pages=1156–60 |pmid=1127169|bibcode = 1975ASAJ...57.1156D }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="phil-22"&gt;{{cite book |last=Deutsch |first=D. |chapter=Grouping mechanisms in music |editor1-first=D. |editor1-last=Deutsch |title=The psychology of music |edition=2nd |pages=299–348 |year=1999 |chapterurl=http://philomel.com/pdf/PsychMus_Ch9.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Musical imagery==
{{See also|Audiation}}
Musical imagery refers to the experience of replaying music by imagining it inside the head.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.2001.tb05733.x |title=Cerebral Substrates of Musical Imagery |year=2006 |last1=Halpern |first1=Andrea R. |journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences |volume=930 |pages=179–92 |pmid=11458829 |issue=1|bibcode = 2001NYASA.930..179H }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Musicians show a superior ability for musical imagery due to intense musical training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1460-9568.2008.06515.x |title=Neural basis of music imagery and the effect of musical expertise |year=2008 |last1=Herholz |first1=Sibylle C. |last2=Lappe |first2=Claudia |last3=Knief |first3=Arne |last4=Pantev |first4=Christo |journal=European Journal of Neuroscience |volume=28 |issue=11 |pages=2352–60 |pmid=19046375}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Herholz, Lappe, Knief and Pantev (2008) investigated the differences in neural processing of a musical imagery task in musicians and non-musicians.  Utilizing magnetoencephalography (MEG), Herholz et al. examined differences in the processing of a musical imagery task with familiar melodies in musicians and non-musicians.  Specifically, the study examined whether the [[mismatch negativity]] (MMN) can be based solely on imagery of sounds.  The task involved participants listening to the beginning of a melody, continuation of the melody in his/her head and finally hearing a correct/incorrect tone as further continuation of the melody.  The imagery of these melodies was strong enough to obtain an early preattentive brain response to unanticipated violations of the imagined melodies in the musicians.  These results indicate similar neural correlates are relied upon for trained musicians imagery and perception.  Additionally, the findings suggest that modification of the imagery mismatch negativity (iMMN) through intense musical training results in achievement of a superior ability for imagery and preattentive processing of music.

Perceptual musical processes and musical imagery may share a neural substrate in the brain.  A PET study conducted by Zatorre, Halpern, Perry, Meyer and Evans (1996) investigated [[cerebral blood flow]] (CBF) changes related to auditory imagery and perceptual tasks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1162/jocn.1996.8.1.29 |title=Hearing in the Mind's Ear: A PET Investigation of Musical Imagery and Perception |year=1996 |last1=Zatorre |first1=Robert J. |last2=Halpern |first2=Andrea R. |last3=Perry |first3=David W. |last4=Meyer |first4=Ernst |last5=Evans |first5=Alan C. |journal=Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience |volume=8 |pages=29–46 |pmid=23972234 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; These tasks examined the involvement of particular anatomical regions as well as functional commonalities between perceptual processes and imagery. Similar patterns of CBF changes provided evidence supporting the notion that imagery processes share a substantial neural substrate with related perceptual processes. Bilateral neural activity in the secondary auditory cortex was associated with both perceiving and imagining songs. This implies that within the secondary auditory cortex, processes underlie the phenomenological impression of imagined sounds.  The [[supplementary motor area]] (SMA) was active in both imagery and perceptual tasks suggesting covert vocalization as an element of musical imagery.  CBF increases in the inferior frontal polar cortex and right thalamus suggest that these regions may be related to retrieval and/or generation of auditory information from memory.

== Absolute pitch ==

[[File:A C D notes.svg|right|150px|thumb|Musicians possessing perfect pitch can identify the pitch of musical tones without external reference.]]

{{Main|Absolute pitch}}

[[Absolute pitch]] (AP) is defined as the ability to identify the pitch of a musical tone or to produce a musical tone at a given pitch without the use of an external reference pitch.&lt;ref name="phil-494"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Deutsch, D. | title=Absolute pitch In D. Deutsch (Ed.) | journal=The psychology of music, 3rd Edition | volume= | pages=141–182 | year=2013 |doi = 10.1016/B978-0-12-381460-9.00005-5 | isbn=9780123814609 }} [http://philomel.com/pdf/PsyMus_3_Ch5_Absolute_Pitch.pdf PDF Document]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0033-2909.113.2.345 |title=Absolute pitch |year=1993 |last1=Takeuchi |first1=Annie H. |last2=Hulse |first2=Stewart H. |journal=Psychological Bulletin |volume=113 |issue=2 |pages=345–61 |pmid=8451339}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Neuroscientific research has not discovered a distinct activation pattern common for possessors of AP.  Zatorre, Perry, Beckett, Westbury and Evans (1998) examined the neural foundations of AP using functional and structural brain imaging techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Robert J. |last1=Zatorre |first2=David W. |last2=Perry |first3=Christine A. |last3=Beckett |first4=Christopher F. |last4=Westbury |first5=Alan C. |last5=Evans |pmid=9501235 |year=1998 |title=Functional anatomy of musical processing in listeners with absolute pitch and relative pitch |volume=95 |issue=6 |pages=3172–7 |pmc=19714 |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |bibcode=1998PNAS...95.3172Z |doi=10.1073/pnas.95.6.3172}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Positron emission tomography (PET) was utilized to measure cerebral blood flow (CBF) in musicians possessing AP and musicians lacking AP.  When presented with musical tones, similar patterns of increased CBF in auditory cortical areas emerged in both groups.  AP possessors and non-AP subjects demonstrated similar patterns of left dorsolateral frontal activity when they performed relative pitch judgments.  However, in non-AP subjects activation in the right inferior frontal cortex was present whereas AP possessors showed no such activity.  This finding suggests that musicians with AP do not need access to working memory devices for such tasks.  These findings imply that there is no specific regional activation pattern unique to AP.  Rather, the availability of specific processing mechanisms and task demands determine the recruited neural areas.

== Emotion ==
{{Main|Music and emotion}}
[[Emotion]]s induced by music activate similar frontal brain regions compared to emotions elicited by other stimuli.&lt;ref name="DoifpsygMissing"/&gt; Schmidt and Trainor (2001) discovered that valence (i.e. positive vs. negative) of musical segments was distinguished by patterns of frontal EEG activity.&lt;ref name="Schmidt"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/02699930126048 |title=Frontal brain electrical activity (EEG) distinguishes valence and intensity of musical emotions |year=2001 |last1=Schmidt |first1=Louis A. |last2=Trainor |first2=Laurel J. |journal=Cognition &amp; Emotion |volume=15 |issue=4 |pages=487–500}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Joyful and happy musical segments were associated with increases in left frontal EEG activity whereas fearful and sad musical segments were associated with increases in right frontal EEG activity.  Additionally, the intensity of emotions was differentiated by the pattern of overall frontal EEG activity.  Overall frontal region activity increased as affective musical stimuli became more intense.&lt;ref name="Schmidt"/&gt;

Music is able to create an incredibly pleasurable experience that can be described as "chills".&lt;ref name="Blood"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1073/pnas.191355898 |title=Intensely pleasurable responses to music correlate with activity in brain regions implicated in reward and emotion |year=2001 |last1=Blood |first1=A. J. |last2=Zatorre |first2=R. J. |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume=98 |issue=20 |pages=11818–11823|bibcode = 2001PNAS...9811818B |pmid=11573015 |pmc=58814}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blood and Zatorre (2001) used PET to measure changes in cerebral blood flow while participants listened to music that they knew to give them the "chills" or any sort of intensely pleasant emotional response. They found that as these chills increase, many changes in cerebral blood flow are seen in brain regions such as the [[amygdala]], [[orbitofrontal cortex]], [[ventral striatum]], [[midbrain]], and the ventral medial [[prefrontal cortex]]. Many of these areas appear to be linked to reward, motivation, emotion, and arousal, and are also activated in other pleasurable situations.&lt;ref name="Blood"/&gt; [[Nucleus accumbens#Research|Nucleus accumbens]] (a part of [[striatum]]) is involved in both music related emotions, as well as rhythmic timing.

When unpleasant melodies are played, the posterior [[cingulate cortex]] activates, which indicates a sense of conflict or emotional pain.&lt;ref name="Tramo"/&gt; The right hemisphere has also been found to be correlated with emotion, which can also activate areas in the cingulate in times of emotional pain, specifically social rejection (Eisenberger). This evidence, along with observations, has led many musical theorists, philosophers and neuroscientists to link emotion with tonality. This seems almost obvious because the tones in music ''seem'' like a characterization of the tones in human speech, which indicate emotional content. The [[vowels]] in the [[phonemes]] of a song are elongated for a dramatic effect, and it seems as though musical tones are simply exaggerations of the normal verbal tonality.

== Memory ==
{{Main|Music-related memory}}

=== Neuropsychology of musical memory ===

[[Music-related memory|Musical memory]] involves both explicit and implicit memory systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s11065-009-9085-2 |title=Memory for Music in Alzheimer's Disease: Unforgettable? |year=2009 |last1=Baird |first1=Amee |last2=Samson |first2=Séverine |journal=Neuropsychology Review |volume=19 |pages=85–101 |pmid=19214750 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Explicit musical memory is further differentiated between episodic (where, when and what of the musical experience) and semantic (memory for music knowledge including facts and emotional concepts). Implicit memory centers on the 'how' of music and involves automatic processes such as procedural memory and motor skill learning – in other words skills critical for playing an instrument. Samson and Baird (2009) found that the ability of musicians with Alzheimer's Disease to play an instrument (implicit procedural memory) may be preserved.

=== Neural correlates of musical memory ===

A PET study looking into the neural correlates of musical [[Semantic memory|semantic]] and [[episodic memory]] found distinct activation patterns.&lt;ref name="Platel"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S1053-8119(03)00287-8 |title=Semantic and episodic memory of music are subserved by distinct neural networks |year=2003 |last1=Platel |first1=Hervé |last2=Baron |first2=Jean-Claude |last3=Desgranges |first3=Béatrice |last4=Bernard |first4=Frédéric |last5=Eustache |first5=Francis |journal=NeuroImage |volume=20 |pages=244–56 |pmid=14527585 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Semantic musical memory involves the sense of familiarity of songs. The semantic memory for music condition resulted in bilateral activation in the medial and orbital frontal cortex, as well as activation in the left angular gyrus and the left anterior region of the middle temporal gyri. These patterns support the functional asymmetry favouring the left hemisphere for semantic memory. Left anterior temporal and inferior frontal regions that were activated in the musical semantic memory task produced activation peaks specifically during the presentation of musical material, suggestion that these regions are somewhat functionally specialized for musical semantic representations.

Episodic memory of musical information involves the ability to recall the former context associated with a musical excerpt.&lt;ref name="Platel"/&gt; In the condition invoking episodic memory for music, activations were found bilaterally in the middle and superior frontal gyri and precuneus, with activation predominant in the right hemisphere. Other studies have found the precuneus to become activated in successful episodic recall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1097/00001756-199510020-00014 |title=Functional role of the prefrontal cortex in retrieval of memories: A PET study |year=1995 |last1=Kapur |first1=Shitij |last2=Craik |first2=Fergus I. M. |last3=Jones |first3=Corey |last4=Brown |first4=Gregory M. |last5=Houle |first5=Sylvain |last6=Tulving |first6=Endel |journal=NeuroReport |volume=6 |issue=14 |pages=1880–4 |pmid=8547589}}&lt;/ref&gt; As it was activated in the familiar memory condition of episodic memory, this activation may be explained by the successful recall of the melody.

When it comes to memory for pitch, there appears to be a dynamic and distributed brain network subserves pitch memory processes. Gaab, Gaser, Zaehle, Jancke and Schlaug (2003) examined the functional anatomy of pitch memory using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S1053-8119(03)00224-6 |title=Functional anatomy of pitch memory—an fMRI study with sparse temporal sampling |year=2003 |last1=Gaab |first1=Nadine |last2=Gaser |first2=Christian |last3=Zaehle |first3=Tino |last4=Jancke |first4=Lutz |last5=Schlaug |first5=Gottfried |journal=NeuroImage |volume=19 |issue=4 |pages=1417–26 |pmid=12948699}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An analysis of performance scores in a pitch memory task resulted in a significant correlation between good task performance and the supramarginal gyrus (SMG) as well as the dorsolateral cerebellum.  Findings indicate that the dorsolateral cerebellum may act as a pitch discrimination processor and the SMG may act as a short-term pitch information storage site.  The left hemisphere was found to be more prominent in the pitch memory task than the right hemispheric regions.

=== Therapeutic effects of music on memory ===
Musical training has been shown to aid [[memory]].  Altenmuller et al. studied the difference between active and passive musical instruction and found both that over a longer (but not short) period of time, the actively taught students retained much more information than the passively taught students. The actively taught students were also found to have greater cerebral cortex activation. It should also be noted that the passively taught students weren't wasting their time; they, along with the active group, displayed greater left hemisphere activity, which is typical in trained musicians.&lt;ref name="Strickland"/&gt;

==Attention ==
Treder et al.&lt;ref name="Treder"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1088/1741-2560/11/2/026009 |title=Decoding auditory attention to instruments in polyphonic music using single-trial EEG classification |year=2014 |last1=Treder |first1=Matthias |last2=Purwins |first2=Hendrik |last3=Miklody |first3=Daniel |last4=Sturm |first4=Irene |last5=Blankertz |first5=Benjamin |journal= Journal of Neural Engineering |volume=11| number=2 |pages=026009|bibcode = 2014JNEng..11b6009T }}&lt;/ref&gt; identified neural correlates of attention when listening to simplified polyphonic music patterns. In a musical oddball experiment, they had participants shift selective attention to one out of three different instruments in music audio clips, with each instrument occasionally playing one or several notes deviating from an otherwise repetitive pattern. Contrasting attended versus unattended instruments, ERP analysis shows subject- and instrument-specific responses including P300 and early auditory components. The attended instrument could be classified offline with high accuracy.  This indicates that attention paid to a particular instrument in polyphonic music can be inferred from ongoing EEG, a finding that is potentially relevant for building more ergonomic music-listing based brain-computer interfaces.&lt;ref name="Treder"/&gt;

==Development==
Musical four-year-olds have been found to have one greater left hemisphere intrahemispheric coherence.&lt;ref name="Strickland"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/00094056.2002.10522714 |title=Review of Research: Music and the Brain in Childhood Development |year=2001 |last1=Burriss |first1=Kathleen Glascott |last2=Strickland |first2=Susan J. |journal=Childhood Education |volume=78 |issue=2 |pages=100–103}}&lt;/ref&gt; Musicians have been found to have more developed anterior portions of the [[corpus callosum]] in a study by Cowell et al. in 1992.  This was confirmed by a study by Schlaug et al. in 1995 that found that classical musicians between the ages of 21 and 36 have significantly greater anterior corpora callosa than the non-musical control. Schlaug also found that there was a strong correlation of musical exposure before the age of seven, and a great increase in the size of the corpus callosum.&lt;ref name="Strickland"/&gt; These fibers join together the left and right hemispheres and indicate an increased relaying between both sides of the brain. This suggests the merging between the spatial- emotiono-tonal processing of the right brain and the linguistical processing of the left brain. This large relaying across many different areas of the brain might contribute to music's ability to aid in memory function.

== Impairment ==
{{Main|Music-specific disorders}}

=== Focal hand dystonia ===

Focal hand [[dystonia]] is a task-related movement disorder associated with occupational activities that require repetitive hand movements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=9646753 |year=1998 |last1=Chen |first1=R |last2=Hallett |first2=M |title=Focal dystonia and repetitive motion disorders |issue=351 |pages=102–6 |journal=Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Focal hand dystonia is associated with abnormal processing in the premotor and primary sensorimotor cortices.  An fMRI study examined five guitarists with focal hand dystonia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1006/nimg.2000.0615 |title=Brain Cortical Activation during Guitar-Induced Hand Dystonia Studied by Functional MRI |year=2000 |last1=Pujol |first1=J. |last2=Roset-Llobet |first2=J. |last3=Rosinés-Cubells |first3=D. |last4=Deus |first4=J. |last5=Narberhaus |first5=B. |last6=Valls-Solé |first6=J. |last7=Capdevila |first7=A. |last8=Pascual-Leone |first8=A. |journal=NeuroImage |volume=12 |issue=3 |pages=257–67 |pmid=10944408}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The study reproduced task-specific hand dystonia by having guitarists use a real guitar neck inside the scanner as well as performing a guitar exercise to trigger abnormal hand movement.  The dystonic guitarists showed significantly more activation of the contralateral primary sensorimotor cortex as well as a bilateral underactivation of premotor areas.  This activation pattern represents abnormal recruitment of the cortical areas involved in motor control.  Even in professional musicians, widespread bilateral cortical region involvement is necessary to produce complex hand movements such as [[Musical scale|scales]] and [[arpeggio]]s.  The abnormal shift from premotor to primary sensorimotor activation directly correlates with guitar-induced hand dystonia.

=== Music agnosia ===

Music [[agnosia]], an [[auditory agnosia]], is a syndrome of selective impairment in music recognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1076/jnmr.28.3.209.3108 |title=Music Agnosias: Selective Impairments of Music Recognition After Brain Damage |year=1999 |last1=Dalla Bella |first1=Simone |last2=Peretz |first2=Isabelle |journal=Journal of New Music Research |volume=28 |issue=3 |pages=209–216}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three cases of music agnosia are examined by Dalla Bella and Peretz (1999); C.N., G.L., and I.R.. All three of these patients suffered bilateral damage to the auditory cortex which resulted in musical difficulties while speech understanding remained intact. Their impairment is specific to the recognition of once familiar melodies. They are spared in recognizing environmental sounds and in recognizing lyrics. Peretz (1996) has studied C.N.'s music agnosia further and reports an initial impairment of pitch processing and spared temporal processing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1162/jocn.1996.8.6.481 |title=Can We Lose Memory for Music? A Case of Music Agnosia in a Nonmusician |year=1996 |last1=Peretz |first1=Isabelle |journal=Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience |volume=8 |issue=6 |pages=481–96 |pmid=23961980}}&lt;/ref&gt; C.N. later recovered in pitch processing abilities but remained impaired in tune recognition and familiarity judgments.

Musical agnosias  may be categorized based on the process which is impaired in the individual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/brain/123.9.1926 |title=Patterns of music agnosia associated with middle cerebral artery infarcts |year=2000 |last1=Ayotte |first1=J. |journal=Brain |volume=123 |issue=9 |pages=1926–38 |pmid=10960056}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apperceptive music agnosia involves an impairment at the level of perceptual analysis involving an inability to encode musical information correctly. Associative music agnosia reflects an impaired representational system which disrupts music recognition. Many of the cases of music agnosia have resulted from surgery involving the middle cerebral artery. Patient studies have surmounted a large amount of evidence demonstrating that the left side of the brain is more suitable for holding long-term memory representations of music and that the right side is important for controlling access to these representations. Associative music agnosias tend to be produced by damage to the left hemisphere, while apperceptive music agnosia reflects damage to the right hemisphere.

=== Congenital amusia ===
Congenital [[amusia]], otherwise known as [[tone deafness]], is a term for lifelong musical problems which are not attributable to mental retardation, lack of exposure to music or deafness, or brain damage after birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1467-8721.2008.00600.x |title=Musical Disorders: From Behavior to Genes |year=2008 |last1=Peretz |first1=Isabelle |journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science |volume=17 |issue=5 |pages=329–333}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amusic brains have been found in fMRI studies to have less white matter and thicker cortex than controls in the right inferior frontal cortex. These differences suggest abnormal neuronal development in the auditory cortex and inferior frontal gyrus, two areas which are important in musical-pitch processing.

Studies on those with [[amusia]] suggest different processes are involved in speech [[tonality]] and musical tonality. [[Congenital]] amusics lack the ability to distinguish between pitches and so are for example unmoved by dissonance and playing the wrong key on a piano. They also cannot be taught to remember a melody or to recite a song; however, they are still capable of hearing the intonation of speech, for example, distinguishing between "You speak French" and "You speak French?" when spoken.

=== Amygdala damage ===
[[File:Amgydala.jpg|right|200px|thumb|Damage to the [[amygdala]] may impair recognition of scary music.]]

Damage to the amygdala has selective emotional impairments on musical recognition.  Gosselin, Peretz, Johnsen and Adolphs (2007) studied S.M., a patient with bilateral damage of the [[amygdala]] with the rest of the temporal lobe undamaged and found that S.M. was impaired in recognition of scary and sad music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2006.07.012 |title=Amygdala damage impairs emotion recognition from music |year=2007 |last1=Gosselin |first1=Nathalie |last2=Peretz |first2=Isabelle |last3=Johnsen |first3=Erica |last4=Adolphs |first4=Ralph |journal=Neuropsychologia |volume=45 |issue=2 |pages=236–44 |pmid=16970965}}&lt;/ref&gt; S.M.'s perception of happy music was normal, as was her ability to use cues such as tempo to distinguish between happy and sad music. It appears that damage specific to the amygdala can selectively impair recognition of scary music.

=== Selective deficit in music reading ===

Specific musical impairments may result from brain damage leaving other musical abilities intact.  Cappelletti, Waley-Cohen, Butterworth and Kopelman (2000) studied a single case study of patient P.K.C., a professional musician who sustained damage to the left posterior temporal lobe as well as a small right occipitotemporal lesion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/13554790008402780 |title=A selective loss of the ability to read and to write music |year=2000 |last1=Cappelletti |first1=M. |last2=Waley-Cohen |first2=H. |last3=Butterworth |first3=B. |last4=Kopelman |first4=M. |journal=Neurocase |volume=6 |issue=4 |pages=321–332}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After sustaining damage to these regions, P.K.C. was selectively impaired in the areas of reading, writing and understanding musical notation but maintained other musical skills. The ability to read aloud letters, words, numbers and symbols (including musical ones) was retained. However, P.K.C. was unable to read aloud musical notes on the staff regardless of whether the task involved naming with the conventional letter or by singing or playing. Yet despite this specific deficit, P.K.C. retained the ability to remember and play familiar and new melodies.

=== Auditory arrhythmia ===

[[Auditory Arrhythmia|Arrhythmia in the auditory modality]] is defined as a disturbance of rhythmic sense; and includes deficits such as the inability to rhythmically perform music, the inability to keep time to music and the inability to discriminate between or reproduce rhythmic patterns.&lt;ref name="Wilson"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0028-3932(01)00198-1 |title=Modelling rhythmic function in a musician post-stroke |year=2002 |last1=Wilson |first1=Sarah J |last2=Pressing |first2=Jeffrey L |last3=Wales |first3=Roger J |journal=Neuropsychologia |volume=40 |issue=8 |pages=1494–505 |pmid=11931954}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A study investigating the elements of rhythmic function examined Patient H.J., who acquired arrhythmia after sustaining a right temporoparietal infarct.&lt;ref name="Wilson"/&gt;  Damage to this region impaired H.J.'s central timing system which is essentially the basis of his global rhythmic impairment.  H.J. was unable to generate steady pulses in a tapping task.  These findings suggest that keeping a musical beat relies on functioning in the right temporal auditory cortex.

'''''Over the Hedge''''' is a 2006 American [[Computer animation|computer-animated]] [[comedy film]] based on the [[United Media]] [[Over the Hedge|comic strip of the same name]]. Produced by [[DreamWorks Animation]] and distributed by [[Paramount Pictures]], which acquired the live-action [[DreamWorks]] studio the same year,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|author= DreamWorks Animation SKG|title=DreamWorks Animation Begins New Distribution Deal With Paramount Pictures|url=http://ir.dreamworksanimation.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=540377|location=Glendale, CA|publisher=[[DreamWorks Animation]]|accessdate=July 4, 2014|date=February 1, 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131212082004/http://ir.dreamworksanimation.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=540377|archive-date=December 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; the film was directed by [[Tim Johnson (film director)|Tim Johnson]] and [[Karey Kirkpatrick]] from a screenplay by [[Len Blum]], Lorne Cameron, [[David Hoselton]] and Kirkpatrick. Featuring the voices of [[Bruce Willis]], [[Garry Shandling]], [[Steve Carell]], [[William Shatner]], [[Wanda Sykes]] and [[Nick Nolte]], the film was released on May 19, 2006 in the United States and earned $336 million on an $80 million budget.

==Plot==
&lt;!-- Per WP:FILM#PLOT, plot summaries should be between 400 and 700 words --&gt;
While scavenging for food, RJ the raccoon enters the cave of Vincent the bear, who has a wagon full of human food taken from a nearby rest stop. RJ accidentally wakes Vincent from his [[hibernation]], and in a race to escape, causes the stash to roll out onto the nearby highway and get run over by a large truck. To avoid being eaten himself, RJ promises Vincent that he will completely replace the stash within the week.

RJ heads towards a recently built suburban [[housing development]] in [[Chesterton, Indiana]], separated from a forest glade by a large hedge. There he discovers a pack of animals recently awoken from their hibernation, led by Verne the turtle; the others include squirrel Hammy, skunk Stella, porcupines Penny and Lou, along with their triplet sons, Spike, Bucky and Quillo; and opossum Ozzie and his daughter Heather. The animals are scared, as the development had been built during their hibernation and they fear they will be unable to forage for food in the small glade. RJ shows them the amount of food humans consume and waste and suggests they forage from the humans. Verne is hesitant but the other animals acquiesce. They make bold attempts to steal food directly from the humans, with RJ secretly guiding them to help collect the food he needs to replace Vincent's stash.

When the animals raid the trash cans of the [[Homeowner association|homeowners-association]] chairwoman Gladys Sharp, she calls an animal exterminator named Dwayne LaFontant, who offers to install in her backyard an illegal, lethal trap called the "Depelter Turbo". Verne sees this and tries to warn the others, but RJ insists they will be okay. Fearing for the safety of the pack, Verne attempts to return what they stole; he and RJ argue, causing a small rampage through the development and destroying the stash RJ had collected for Vincent. After a brief argument, RJ and Verne make up and RJ rallies the others to raid Gladys' home directly on the night before a large party. With Stella disguised as a cat to distract Gladys' own cat, Tiger, the others enter Gladys' home and collect all the food. RJ inadvertently reveals his duplicity to the animals, just as they are discovered by Gladys who calls Dwayne. RJ escapes with the food for Vincent but leaves the other animals to be captured by Dwayne.

As RJ returns the food to Vincent, he sees Dwayne's truck drive by and, consumed by remorse, uses the food to knock the truck off the road, enraging Vincent. Dwayne is knocked out while the animals get free, and Spike, Bucky and Quillo use skills they learned from a videogame to drive the truck back to the development. RJ pleads to be let in the truck as Vincent tries to catch him, but the others, angry at his treachery, refuse. Verne convinces the group to forgive RJ since he came back to save them. They return the truck to the development, crashing through Gladys' home, and the animals flee into the hedge. Gladys and Dwayne converge on the animals from one side with a [[String trimmer]] and a [[Cattle prod]] respectively, while Vincent tries to swipe at them from the other. To escape, RJ gives Hammy a [[Energy drink|caffeinated beverage]], allowing the hyperactive squirrel to move incredibly fast. Hammy is able to manipulate Dwayne into capturing Vincent, causing Vincent, Gladys, and Dwayne to be trapped by the Depelter Turbo while the animals escape. The police and animal control arrive, and Vincent is sent to the [[Rocky Mountains]] while Gladys is arrested for using the Depelter Turbo. Dwayne escapes when Gladys gets arrested only to get bitten by Nugent.

RJ and Verne apologize to each other, and RJ is brought into the group, as is Tiger, who became infatuated with Stella even after learning she was a skunk. Verne realizes they have not had a chance to forage for food until Hammy reveals that while sped up, he had been able to collect enough nuts for them all to last the year.

==Cast==
[[File:Bruce Willis Cannes 2006.jpg|thumb|175px|[[Bruce Willis]] at the film's premiere at the [[2006 Cannes Film Festival]]]]
* [[Bruce Willis]] as RJ, a [[raccoon]] who is funny, amazing, and extremely intelligent. Despite his hard outer shell, he is revealed to have a sensitive personality, developing feelings of guilt over using his new-found companions to his own ends.
* [[Garry Shandling]] as Verne, a naturally cynical [[ornate box turtle]], the leader of the foragers. He has his own ways of doing the daily tasks, but his world is turned upside-down when RJ introduces his free-spirited lifestyle into the mix. Though Verne genuinely cares for his family, he tends to condescend to them. A couple of [[running gag]]s throughout the film are everyone calling him an [[amphibian]] and him correcting them with [[reptile]] (though Dwayne already knew he was a reptile, but first mistook him as an amphibian), as well as his shell constantly falling off.
* [[Steve Carell]] as Hammy, a hyperactive [[American red squirrel]], whose mouth moves as fast as his feet and loves [[cookie]]s. He is naïve and childish in nature, with an extremely short attention span. The [[double entendre]] of Hammy's constantly trying to find his nuts is a third running gag in the film.
* [[Wanda Sykes]] as Stella, a short-tempered, sassy [[striped skunk]] who is constantly being told by the other foragers that she needs a man in her life.
* [[Eugene Levy]] as Lou, a [[North American porcupine]] father and family patriarch with an overly friendly and optimistic attitude.
* [[Catherine O'Hara]] as Penny, the porcupine family mother and matriarch; she serves as a ground between their family and the other animals.
* [[Shane Baumel]], Sami Kirkpatrick, and [[Madison Davenport]] as Spike, Bucky and Quillo, Lou and Penny′s three identical children. They're big on video games and are the most enthusiastic about exploring the world beyond the hedge.
[[File:Avril Lavigne Cannes 2006.jpg|thumb|175px|[[Avril Lavigne]] at the film's premiere at the [[2006 Cannes Film Festival]]]]
* [[William Shatner]] and [[Avril Lavigne]] as Ozzie and Heather, a [[Virginia opossum]] father and daughter who see the world from different points of view; Ozzie often embarrasses Heather when he feigns death to get away from danger.
* [[Omid Djalili]] as Tiger, a [[Persian cat]] whose sense of smell has faded to nothing after years of his "beautiful" evolution, and his full Persian name is "Prince Tigerius Mahmoud Shabazz."&lt;ref name=AVReviewNotes&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ziebarth|first1=Christian|title=Over the Hedge: review, interviews, and production notes|url=http://animatedviews.com/2006/over-the-hedge-review-interviews-and-production-notes/|website=Animated Views|accessdate=August 18, 2014|date=May 18, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; He falls in love with Stella, who's disguised as a cat for distracting him while the group steals food from Gladys' house, and comes to live with her at the end of the film.
* [[Nick Nolte]] as Vincent, an [[American black bear]] whom RJ owes food and whose barbaric behavior intimidates him. He used to be friends with RJ until he had tried to steal his food and then losing it in traffic. He makes a cameo in ''[[Bee Movie]]''.&lt;ref name=AVBeeFacts&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ziebarth|first1=Christian|title=Bee Movie Fun Facts|url=http://animatedviews.com/2007/bee-movie-fun-facts/|website=Animated Views|accessdate=September 11, 2014|date=September 14, 2007|quote=Vincent the bear from ''Over the Hedge'' appears in both a trailer for ''Bee Movie'' and in the courtroom scene in the film.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Allison Janney]] as Gladys Sharp, a [[human]] and president of the Camelot Estates Home Owners Association. She is disgusted by animals and is strict on H.O.A. rules. At the end, Gladys is arrested for using an illegal animal trap called a Depelter Turbo.
* [[Thomas Haden Church]] as Dwayne LaFontant,&lt;ref name=AWNLandsDVD&gt;{{cite web|last1=DeMott|first1=Rick|title=Over the Hedge Lands on DVD With New Hammy Short|url=https://www.awn.com/news/over-hedge-lands-dvd-new-hammy-short|publisher=[[Animation World Network]]|accessdate=August 18, 2014|date=October 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AMPopularDiscs&gt;{{cite web|last1=Zahed|first1=Ramin|title=Over the Hedge Critters Prove Popular on Discs|url=http://www.animationmagazine.net/home-entertainment/over-the-hedge-critters-prove-popular-on-discs/|work=[[Animation Magazine]]|accessdate=August 18, 2014|date=October 27, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; an over-zealous [[human]] pest [[Pest control|exterminator]] hired by Gladys. He is often fooled by plastic garden flamingos, but has an innate sense of the animals surrounding him by sniffing and then killing them. Through this, he can detect the species of any animal that has recently been in the area. He spoofs the [[The Terminator|Terminator]].
* [[Brian Stepanek]] as Nugent, a playful [[Rottweiler]] whose only intelligible word is "Play!", other than barking.

Two minor human characters, appearing during the dog chase scene, were voiced by Lee Bienstock and [[Sean Yazbeck]], two participants on ''[[The Apprentice (U.S. Season 5)|The Apprentice 5]]'' as part of a reward for winning a task.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dehnart|first1=Andy|title=Lee and Sean record Over the Hedge cameos and Sean kisses Hollywood ass|url=https://www.realityblurred.com/realitytv/2006/05/the-apprentice-5-lee_sean_reward/|website=reality blurred|accessdate=July 3, 2014|date=May 16, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical response===
On the [[film-critics]] [[Review aggregator|aggregator]] [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has received 75% positive reviews, based on 170 reviews with an average of  6.8/10. The site's consensus states: "Even if it's not an animation classic, ''Over the Hedge'' is clever and fun, and the jokes cater to family members of all ages."&lt;ref name=RT&gt;{{cite web|title=Over the Hedge (2006)|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/over_the_hedge/|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|publisher=[[Fandango (company)|Fandango Media]]|accessdate=October 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On another aggregator, [[Metacritic]], the film has a rating of 67/100, indicating "generally favorable."&lt;ref name=MC&gt;{{cite web|title=Over the Hedge Reviews|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/over-the-hedge|website=[[Metacritic]]|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|accessdate=February 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Audiences polled by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film an average grade of "A" on an A+ to F scale.&lt;ref name="CinemaScore"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cinemascore.com/ |title=CinemaScore |website=[[CinemaScore]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critic [[Frank Lovece]] of ''[[Film Journal International]]'' found that, "DreamWorks' slapstick animated adaptation of the philosophically satiric comic strip ... is a lot of laughs and boasts a much tighter story than most animated features." Ken Fox of ''[[TV Guide|TVGuide.com]]'' called it "a sly satire of American 'enough is never enough' consumerism and blind progress at the expense of the environment. It's also very funny, and the little woodland critters that make up the cast are a kiddie-pleasing bunch".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.tvguide.com/movies/over-the-hedge/review/279933/ |title=Over The Hedge - Movie Reviews and Movie Ratings |last=Fox |first=Ken |date= |website=[[TV Guide]] |publisher= |access-date=November 17, 2010 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tajikistan is a [[sex tourism]] destination for [[Afghanistan|Afghans]].&lt;ref name="wallstreet"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Trofimov|first1=Yaroslav|title=The Siren Call Of Central Asia|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10000872396390443684104578067010200662502|website=Wall Street Journal|accessdate=29 January 2018|date=29 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The more liberal regime in Tajikistan, the poverty of the country and a similar language make it attractive to Afghans, even if a Tajik visa may cost $500.&lt;ref name="wallstreet" /&gt; Tajikistan has such a bad reputation in Afghanistan than men going to the country may tell their wives they are going to [[India]].&lt;ref name="wallstreet" /&gt;

==Sex trafficking==
{{see also|Human trafficking in Tajikistan}}
Tajikistan is a source and destination country for women and children subjected to sex trafficking. Women and children from Tajikistan are subjected to sex trafficking primarily in [[Turkey]], [[UAE]], and [[Russia]], and also in [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Kazakhstan]], and Afghanistan, as well as within Tajikistan.&lt;ref name="state17"&gt;{{cite web|title=Tajikistan 2017 Trafficking in Persons Report|url=https://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/countries/2017/271295.htm|website=U.S. Department of State|accessdate=29 January 2018}}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women and minors are increasingly vulnerable to trafficking. In some cases, migrant laborers abandon their families, making women more vulnerable to trafficking as sole providers for their families. Some women who travelled to [[Syria]] or [[Iraq]] with promises of marriage were instead sold into [[sexual slavery]]. Tajik women and girls are transported to Afghanistan for the purpose of forced marriage, which can lead to sex trafficking. Tajik children are subjected to sex trafficking in Tajikistan and Afghanistan.&lt;ref name="state17" /&gt;

Article 130.1 of the 2003 criminal code, amended in 2004 and 2008, prohibits all forms of trafficking, including the use of force, fraud or coercion for the purpose of sexual exploitation and forced labour. The article prescribes penalties of five to 15 years imprisonment.&lt;ref name="state17" /&gt;

The [[United States Department of State]] [[Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons]] ranks Tajikistan as a '[[Trafficking in Persons Report#Ranking System|Tier 2 Watch List]]' country.&lt;ref name="state18"&gt;{{cite web |title=Tajikistan 2018 Trafficking in Persons Report |url=https://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/countries/2018/282762.htm |website=U.S. Department of State |accessdate=1 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Random Acts of Kindness Day''' is a day to celebrate and encourage [[random acts of kindness]]. "It's just a day to celebrate kindness and the whole [[pay it forward]] mentality", said Tracy Van Kalsbeek, executive director of the Stratford Perth Community Foundation, in 2016, where the day is celebrated on November 4.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Beitz, Mike |publisher=The Beacon Herald|url=http://www.stratfordbeaconherald.com/2016/10/21/stratford-and-area-set-to-celebrate-random-acts-of-kindness-day |title=Stratford and area set to celebrate Random Acts of Kindness Day |accessdate=October 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is celebrated on September 1 in New Zealand and on February 17 in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Cain, Brenda Cain |publisher=cleveland.com|url=http://www.cleveland.com/best/2016/02/feb_17_is_random_acts_of_kindn.html |title=Today is Random Acts of Kindness Day; nominate someone for February Person of the Month |accessdate=October 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Random Acts of Kindness Foundation|url=https://www.randomactsofkindness.org/ |title=Random Acts of Kindness Day |accessdate=October 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.azcentral.com/story/inside-12/2015/02/16/12-news-12-random-acts-of-kindness/23523321/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rizin Fighting Federation''' ('''Rizin FF''') is a Japanese [[mixed martial arts]] organization created in 2015 by the former [[Pride Fighting Championships|Pride Fighting Championships]] and [[Dream Stage Entertainment]] president [[Nobuyuki Sakakibara]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Nobuyuki Sakakibara discusses Rizin FF plans for 2016, Fedor Emelianenko’s opponent, drug testing and more|url=http://www.mmafighting.com/2015/10/27/9615018/nobuyuki-sakakibara-discusses-rizin-ff-plans-for-2016-fedor|website = MMA Fighting|accessdate= 2015-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Former Pride FC boss: Fedor's opponent will mean something for future of MMA|url=http://www.bloodyelbow.com/2015/9/23/9383185/pride-fc-sakikabara-fedor-emelianenko-vladimir-putin-russia-japan-mma-news|website =Bloody Elbow|accessdate= 2015-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The inaugural Rizin FF was broadcast in North America by [[Spike (TV network)|Spike TV]]. Other past and present broadcasters include [[SKY Perfect JSAT Corporation]], [[Fuji Television]], [[Fox Sports (Brazil)|Fox Sports Brazil]], [[Kix (Asian TV channel)|Kix]] and [[Match TV]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Event Summary Rizen Fighting Federation|url = http://www.rizinff.com/en/summary|website = rizinff.com|accessdate = 2015-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rizin FF streams exclusively on digital on FITE TV in North America and Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Rizin FF Partners with FITE TV|url = http://www.sherdog.com/news/news/Rizin-FF-Partners-with-FITE-TV-to-Stream-April-16-Event-in-Yokohama-on-PPV-119563|website=sherdog.com|accessdate = 2017-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

=== Origins === 
The precursors of RIZIN Fighting Federation were [[Pride Fighting Championships|PRIDE]] (founded 1997, dissolved 2007), and [[Dream (mixed martial arts)|DREAM]] (founded 2008, dissolved 2012). PRIDE was an original competitor of the [[Ultimate Fighting Championship|UFC]], largely considered to be the premier mixed martial arts organization worldwide, and produced many of the stars during the 'golden age' of MMA, who went on to become UFC champions and Hall of Famers. Once PRIDE was purchased by the UFC, they absorbed most of their contracted roster. Less than 1 year after PRIDE's final event, DREAM was founded. Most of the executives and staff from PRIDE sought to recreate the same philosophy and ambition that their former organization had. Upon the dissolution of [[Hero's|HERO'S]], [[Fighting and Entertainment Group]] collaborated with [[Dream Stage Entertainment]] to create DREAM. Despite running nearly 25 events across from 2008 until the end of 2012, and establishing partnerships with [[Shooto]], [[M-1 Global]], [[Elite Xtreme Combat|Elite XC]], [[Strikeforce (mixed martial arts)|Strikeforce]], [[ProElite]], and [[ONE Championship]], the promotion sunsetted in the summer of 2012.

=== Official Announcement ===
On September 19, 2015 during [[Bellator MMA &amp; Glory: Dynamite 1|Bellator 142 Dynamite 1]] event, it was announced that Nobuyuki Sakakibara had signed one of the most successful and famous heavyweights in history, former [[List of Pride champions|Pride Heavyweight Champion]] 'The Last Emperor' [[Fedor Emelianenko]] to headline his new promotion’s New Year’s Eve Show in Tokyo. Then, on October 8, 2015 The former President of [[Pride Fighting Championships|Pride FC]] - Nobuyuki Sakakibara - held a press conference to announce his return to [[mixed martial arts|MMA]] with Rizin Fighting Federation. Sakakibara returned to mainstream [[mixed martial arts|MMA]], along with [[Nobuhiko Takada]] and other former [[Pride Fighting Championships|Pride FC]] employees. The concept of the event was to create a platform where all promotions and fighters can compete while keeping their diverse culture, customs and characteristics. With countless promotions existing globally, RIZIN seeks to gather top competitors to determine who is the best; not competing with existing organizations as a sole promotion. Rather, to structure a federation to host, hold and operate fights.

Aside from the previously announced presence of Emelianenko (who was speculated to fight against Jaideep Singh), [[Kazushi Sakuraba]] was announced to take on [[Shinya Aoki]], as well as female competitors [[Gabi Garcia]] and [[Rena Kubota|RENA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Long after his prime, Kazushi Sakuraba is in the position to save Japanese MMA|url = https://www.mmafighting.com/2015/10/18/9494533/long-after-his-prime-sakuraba-is-in-the-position-to-save-japanese-mma|website=mmafighting.com|accessdate = 2018-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, the classic Grand Prix tournament was announced (held at 100kg or roughly 220lbs), with champions and competitors from [[Bellator MMA|Bellator]], [[Konfrontacja Sztuk Walki|KSW]], [[Jungle Fight]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Newly crowned Jungle Fight champion enters Rizin FF heavyweight tournament|url = https://www.mmafighting.com/2015/10/25/9610158/newly-crowned-jungle-fight-champion-enters-rizin-ff-heavyweight|website=mmafighting.com|accessdate = 2018-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;, [[BAMMA]], and [[King of Kings (kickboxing)|King of Kings]]. Most notably, [[Muhammed Lawal|King Mo]] was announced to represent Bellator in the tournament.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 'King Mo' to represent Bellator in Rizin light heavyweight grand prix|url = https://www.mmafighting.com/2015/11/6/9686692/king-mo-to-represent-bellator-in-rizin-light-heavyweight-grand-prix|website=mmafighting.com|accessdate = 2018-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; All bouts will take place in a ring under PRIDE rules. In attendance were Bellator president [[Scott Coker]], and [[Paramount_Network#Spike_TV_(2003–2018)|Spike TV]] executive Jon Slusser, with Coker stating that his promotion and network were fully committed to supporting RIZIN. Coker went on to say, "There was a time not long ago where the best fighters in the world fought here in Japan four or five times a year."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = No opponent for Fedor Emelianenko announced at Rizin FF introductory press conference|url = https://www.mmafighting.com/2015/10/8/9477863/no-opponent-for-fedor-emelianenko-announced-at-rizin-ff-introductory|website=mmafighting.com|accessdate = 2018-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The winner of the Grand Prix was to take home the prize of $500,000. The 8-man bracket was officially finalized on November 30th, 2015, with other bouts also being announced shortly thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Rizin announces heavyweight tournament bracket|url = https://www.mmafighting.com/2015/11/30/9818490/rizin-announces-heavyweight-tournament-brackets|website=mmafighting.com|accessdate = 2018-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Muhammed 'King Mo' Lawal lands opponent at RIZIN FF|url = https://www.mmafighting.com/2015/12/9/9879398/muhammed-king-mo-lawal-to-face-brett-mcdermott-in-rizin-ff-heavyweight-mma-tournament|website=mmafighting.com|accessdate = 2018-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Bellator fighter Brennan Ward, additional mixed-rules fight announced for Rizin debut|url = https://www.mmafighting.com/2015/12/10/9886568/bellator-fighter-ward-and-mixed-rules-fight-announced-for-rizin-debut|website=mmafighting.com|accessdate = 2018-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Jerome LeBanner returns to MMA at Rizin|url = https://www.mmafighting.com/2015/12/14/10123964/jerome-lebanner-returns-to-mma-at-rizin|website=mmafighting.com|accessdate = 2018-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Kron Gracie]] (who's father [[Rickson Gracie|Rickson]] competed at the inaugural PRIDE event) was announced to participate against Asen Yamamoto.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Kron Gracie added to Rizin FF card in December|url = https://www.mmafighting.com/2015/11/9/9696536/kron-gracie-added-to-rizin-ff-card-in-december|website=mmafighting.com|accessdate = 2018-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amongst the veterans in the Japanese scene, [[Tsuyoshi Kosaka]] would face [[James Thompson (fighter)|James Thompson]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Fedor Emelianenko still without an opponent, Tsuyoshi Kosaka to face James Thompson at Rizin|url = https://www.mmafighting.com/2015/11/22/9770422/tsuyoshi-kosaka-wont-be-fedors-next-opponent-facing-james-thompson|website=mmafighting.com|accessdate = 2018-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Akebono Tarō]] would face [[Bob Sapp]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Rizin signs Sapp vs. Akebono rematch for its debut|url = https://www.mmafighting.com/2015/11/28/9806740/rizin-signs-sapp-vs-akebono-rematch-for-its-debut|website=mmafighting.com|accessdate = 2018-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the spirit of Japanese MMA, Sakakibara mentioned that he wanted to bring back every fighter that shined in PRIDE to the RIZIN ring, and even proposed a potential 'master class' for those who were over 45 years old, citing Dan Henderson as an example of someone who can still compete at that age. Sakakibara was quoted, "My personal opinion is that athletes today don’t fight because of a few kilos. Because of two or three kilos, we can’t book a fight that could be very interesting. We want to change this mentality. Fans are missing many great fights, like [[Cristiane Justino|Cris Cyborg]] and [[Ronda Rousey]], because of a little difference in weight. We won’t force anyone to fight, of course, but if the athlete wants to fight despite a few kilos, we will promote the fight. Of course, always respecting the safety of the fighters." Initial plans for the annual schedule were to do at most four events per year, as opposed to the frequent schedule of the UFC, in order to build up the excitement and anticipation for RIZIN events - similar to the World Cup of soccer. Scheduled to take place on the 29th and 31st of December in 2015, the first event will commemorate PRIDE, and the second event will usher in the RIZIN era.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Nobuyuki Sakakibara discusses Rizin FF plans for 2016, Fedor Emelianenko’s opponent, drug testing and more|url = https://www.mmafighting.com/2015/10/27/9615018/nobuyuki-sakakibara-discusses-rizin-ff-plans-for-2016-fedor|website=mmafighting.com|accessdate = 2018-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Inaugural Event ===
In December 2015, Rizin Fighting Federation hosted the first [[2015 in Rizin Fighting Federation#100 Kg Grand-Prix bracket|Rizin World Grand-Prix]], a two-part 100&amp;nbsp;kg  tournament held to find the "world's best fighter". The tournament was held over the course of two events, with eight fighters competing in an opening round and the four winners returning two days later for the final round. The second round of the tournament  was broadcast in the United States and featured American fighter [[Muhammed Lawal]] winning the tournament by defeating [[Brett McDermott]], Teodoras Aukstuolis, and Jiri Prochazka in the two-day event.

=== Grand Prix 2016 ===
On July 16, 2016 Nobuyuki Sakakibara announced at a press conference that Rizin Fighting Federation will host a 16-man openweight tournament September 25 in Tokyo. Former PRIDE Grand Prix champion [[Mirko Filipovic|Mirko “Cro Cop” Filipovic]] and former PRIDE middleweight champion [[Wanderlei Silva]] to participate in the tournament. Despite the rubber-match not being realized due to an injury sustained by Silva, Mirko "Cro Cop" won the championship, defeating Hyun Man Myung, King Mo, Baruto, and [[Amir Aliakbari]] all via stoppage.

===Grand Prix 2017===

Kickboxing sensation [[Tenshin Nasukawa]] knocked out both of his opponents to win the kickboxing tournament.

'''''Saved by the Bell: The College Years''''' is an American [[sitcom]] [[sequel]] to the ''[[Saved by the Bell]]'' series that ran from May 22, 1993 to February 8, 1994, lasting for only one season. It is the third incarnation of the franchise. It is also the only series of the franchise to air on [[primetime]] television instead of Saturday mornings. It aired on [[NBC]] on Tuesday evenings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1993-09-26/news/tv-39113_1_beverly-hills|title=On View : Freshmen, Again : Can 'Saved By The Bell' and 'beverly Hills, 90210' Pass The Test As They Head Off To College?|author=N.F. Mendoza|date=September 26, 1993|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=2016-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Premise==
''Saved by the Bell: The College Years'' is very similar to the original ''Saved by the Bell'' series; the plotline has to do with the six characters getting into trouble each week at the fictitious California University (Cal U), under the watchful eye of Mike Rogers ([[Bob Golic]]), their dorm adviser. The series includes [[Zack Morris]], Samuel "Screech" Powers, and A.C. Slater (from the original ''Saved by the Bell'' series) as the main characters, along with newcomers Leslie Burke ([[Anne Tremko]]), Alex Tabor ([[Kiersten Warren]]) and Danielle Marks ([[Essence Atkins]]). After the pilot, however, Atkins's role was eliminated, and [[Tiffani Thiessen|Tiffani-Amber Thiessen]] returned to the show in her role of Kelly Kapowski. Danielle was written out of the series as having transferred to another college.

During the first and second episodes, the series centers around Zack's schemes to try to get Leslie, who despises Zack due to his sneaky schemes, to fall for him. Later, when Kelly decides to transfer to Cal U, Zack has to make a decision about who he really loves, as he still has feelings for Kelly. When Kelly and Leslie find out about Zack secretly liking both of them, they decide to both dump him. Starting with the third episode, the plotline becomes more centered around the whole gang, instead of just Leslie and Zack, and their various college issues.

In the beginning of the series, dorm adviser Mike Rogers is portrayed as tough-as-nails, although later in the series, he becomes softer and takes a liking to the kids. Mike played for the [[San Francisco 49ers]] at one point, but later decided to quit to become the Cal U dorm adviser. In one episode, he tries to train so he could play football again, but decides it was too much work and stays with his current job. Beginning with episode 15 ("The Rave"), [[Holland Taylor]] became involved with the series, portraying a [[Mr. Belding]]-type character named Dean McMann. She takes the role of the tough-as-nails authority figure that Mike originally was to be at the beginning of the series. Like Mr. Belding, she takes a disliking to Zack's schemes and often punishes him in various ways because of his antics.

An overarching theme of the series is Zack's efforts to win back the affection of Kelly, who is in love with their [[anthropology]] professor Jeremiah Lasky ([[Patrick Fabian]]). Eventually, Zack wins Kelly over again, and they become engaged.

The series was cancelled after only one season, due to low ratings, averaging only a 7.8/12 rating/share, and ranking 88th out of 118 shows in the yearly [[Nielsen Ratings|ratings]]. It had to deal with huge competition from both ''[[Full House]]'' and the first half of ''[[Rescue 911]]'', both of which ranked in the Nielsen Top 30 that season. Only 19 episodes were produced. Episode 19 ("Wedding Plans") left the series with a [[cliffhanger]] ending, where Zack and Kelly had not yet gotten married. To give closure to the series, a 90-minute TV movie, ''[[Saved by the Bell: Wedding in Las Vegas]]'', was produced to wrap up the series. All the main actors agreed to come back for the movie, except [[Anne Tremko]], who declined a role in the movie. This series was the last to feature main characters Zack Morris, A.C. Slater and Kelly Kapowski, except for occasional appearances from Zack and Slater in ''[[Saved by the Bell: The New Class]]''. Zack, Slater and Lisa (who only appeared in episodes 19 and 20) all appeared again in "Goodbye Bayside: Part 2," which marked the last appearance to date of Zack and Lisa. Slater appeared one more time in "Fire at the Max: Part 2" of ''The New Class''. Kelly never again appeared after "Wedding in Las Vegas." Screech, however, would return in ''The New Class'' seasons 2–7 as Mr. Belding's administrative assistant on a work-study program from Cal U.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1279">'''Showmanship''', concerning artistic performing such as in [[Theatre]], is the skill of performing in such a manner that will appeal to an audience or aid in conveying the performance's essential theme or message. 

For instance, the [[Canada|Canadian]] [[stage magician]] [[Doug Henning]] used many classic illusions in his magic show. However, he made the old material seem new by rejecting the old stylistic cliches of the art (such as wearing [[formal wear]]), and by presenting them with a childlike exuberance that respected the audience's intelligence.

Profitable showmanship frequently appeals to [[pathos]]. Showmen aim to display goods with tact in order to sell an object or a show.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=QVNfe0PQUPEC|title = Profitable Showmanship|last = Goode|first = Kenneth|date = 2008-10-01|publisher = Read Books|isbn = 9781443745628|language = en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Companies producing drama and entertainment claim that displaying fairness  is necessary.&lt;ref name="lib"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ir.lib.sfu.ca/dspace/bitstream/1892/6839/1/b15025135.pdf|title=Summit &amp;#124; SFU's Institutional Repository|accessdate=2015-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hyewon-Ssanguk.sammae.jpg|thumb| Players and observers alike absorbed in a Ssangryuk game during the [[Joseon dynasty]]]]

'''''Ssangryuk''''' ([[hangul]]: 쌍륙, [[hanja]]: 雙六) is a traditional Korean game.

==Introduction==

''Ssangryuk'' (or Ssanguk) is a game using dice that is most commonly played in winter. It has a game board, 30 horses and 2 dice. It is also called ''ssangryuk'' (same spelling and sound but different ''hanja'': 雙陸), ''aksak'' (hangul: 악삭, hanja: 握槊), ''sangryuk'' (상륙, 象陸), and ''ssangyuk'' (상육, 象陸).

The game is similar in structure and play to [[Backgammon]] the classic strategy game and is probably related to the [[Tables (board game)|Tables]] family of games.&lt;ref&gt;https://kuiwon.wordpress.com/category/korean-eras-%E9%9F%93%E5%9C%8B%E6%99%82%E4%BB%A3-%ED%95%9C%EA%B5%AD%EC%8B%9C%EB%8C%80/chosun-late-period-%E6%9C%9D%E9%AE%AE%E5%BE%8C%E6%9C%9F-%EC%A1%B0%EC%84%A0%ED%9B%84%EA%B8%B0-1637-1897/pak-jiweon-%E6%9C%B4%E8%B6%BE%E6%BA%90-%EB%B0%95%EC%A7%80%EC%9B%90/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contents==

The game board doesn't have any required size, but on average it is 80&amp;nbsp;cm long and 40&amp;nbsp;cm wide. A die is about 1&amp;nbsp;cm³ and is made from ivory or bone. Tiger bone is preferred.

'''''Stardust''''' is a [[shoot 'em up]] [[computer game]] for the [[Amiga]], released by the [[Finland|Finnish]] company [[Bloodhouse]] in 1993.  The game is essentially an ''[[Asteroids (video game)|Asteroids]]'' clone with enhancements, such as [[power-up]]s, shields, a high-energy techno [[module file|module]] soundtrack, vivid use of colors and the occasional tunnel section that revolves around a sphere.  The game's [[graphics]] drew critical acclaim for the aforementioned tunnels and the liberal use of [[Ray tracing (graphics)|ray-tracing]].  The company has since merged with [[Terramarque]] to form [[Housemarque]].

In a not atypical bout of Finnish humor, the developers gave several things ludicrous names in their own language, which were (and still are) highly obscure in the international market. The [[damsel in distress]] is named after a brand of [[margarine]], and the final confrontation takes place over the planet [[Imatra]].

The game was also ported to the [[IBM compatible PC|PC]], but not by the original programmers. This version was buggy, scant on details found in the Amiga version and severely lacking in both control and [[gameplay]] polish.

Conversion made for the [[Atari ST#STE|Atari STE]] by Aggression demoscene crew was published in 1995 by [[Daze Marketing]] Ltd. It is notable of being one of the few games utilizing Atari STE's technical capabilities (in contrast to older Atari ST).

However, an enhanced sequel was released three years later for [[Advanced Graphics Architecture|AGA]] Amigas, [[Amiga CD32]], and finally for the [[IBM compatible PC|PC]] platform as well.  Named ''[[Super Stardust]]'' (or ''Super Stardust '96''), the game features a CD soundtrack from [[Slusnik Luna]], [[Full motion video|FMV]] [[cut-scene]]s, high speed gameplay and completely new levels and enemies.

In April 2007, [[Sony Computer Entertainment]] released [[Super Stardust HD]] as a downloadable [[PlayStation Network]] game for the [[PlayStation 3]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.1up.com/do/previewPage?cId=3158563|title=Previews: Super Stardust HD |author=Puha, Thomas |publisher=1up|date=2007-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2012, [[Super Stardust Delta]] was released on the [[PlayStation Network]] as a downloadable title for the [[PlayStation Vita]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7727">{{Surrealism infobox}}'''Surreal humour''' (also known as '''absurdist humour''') or '''surreal comedy''', is a form of [[humour]] predicated on deliberate violations of [[causality|causal]] reasoning, producing events and behaviours that are obviously [[illogical]]. Constructions of surreal humour tend to involve bizarre juxtapositions, incongruity, [[Non sequitur (literary device)|non-sequiturs]], irrational or absurd situations and expressions of [[nonsense]].&lt;ref name=stockwell&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stockwell|first1=Peter|title=The Language of Surrealism|page=177|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=KZhNDQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA177&amp;ots=bF_bhXW_12&amp;dq=Surreal%20humour&amp;pg=PA177#v=onepage&amp;q=Surreal%20humour&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The humour arises from a subversion of audience's expectations, so that amusement is founded on [[predictability|unpredictability]], separate from a logical analysis of the situation. The humour derived gets its appeal from the ridiculousness and unlikeliness of the situation. The genre has roots in [[Surrealism]] in the arts.&lt;ref name=stockwell/&gt;

==Literary precursors==
[[File:Edward Lear and His Cat Foss 1885.jpg|thumb|''Edward Lear, Aged 73 and a Half and His Cat Foss, Aged 16'', an 1885 lithograph by [[Edward Lear]]]]
Surreal humour is the effect of [[logic|illogic]] and [[absurdity]] being used for humorous effect. Under such premises, people can identify precursors and early examples of surreal humour at least since the 19th century, such as [[Lewis Carroll]]'s ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]'' and ''[[Through the Looking-Glass]]'', which both use illogic and absurdity ([[hookah]]-smoking [[caterpillars]], [[croquet]] matches using live [[flamingos]] as mallets, etc.) for humorous effect. Many of [[Edward Lear]]'s children stories and poems contain [[literary nonsense|nonsense]] and are basically surreal in approach. For example, ''The Story of the Four Little Children Who Went Round the World'' (1871) is filled with contradictory statements and odd images intended to provoke amusement, such as the following:
{{quote|After a time they saw some land at a distance; and when they came to it, they found it was an island made of water quite surrounded by earth. Besides that, it was bordered by evanescent isthmuses with a great Gulf-stream running about all over it, so that it was perfectly beautiful, and contained only a single tree, 503 feet high.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lear|first=Edward|title=Nonsense Songs, Stories, Botany, and Alphabets|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/13650/13650-h/13650-h.htm#children}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Relationship with dadaism and futurism==
In the early 20th century, several [[avant-garde]] movements, including the [[Dadaism|dadaists]], [[Surrealism|surrealists]], and [[Futurism (art)|futurists]] began to argue for an art that was random, jarring and illogical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The History of Futurism: The Precursors, Protagonists, and Legacies|publisher=Lexington Books|year=2012|editor1-last=Buelens|editor1-first=Geert|editor2-last=Hendrix|editor2-first=Harald|editor3-last=Jansen|editor3-first=Monica|isbn=0-739-17387-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goals of these movements were in some sense serious, and they were committed to undermining the solemnity and self-satisfaction of the contemporary artistic [[wikt:establishment|establishment]]. As a result, much of their art was intentionally amusing.

A famous example is [[Marcel Duchamp]]'s ''[[Fountain (Duchamp)|Fountain]]'' (1917), an inverted urinal signed "R. Mutt". This became one of the most famous and influential pieces of art in history, and one of the earliest examples of the [[found object]] movement. It is also a joke, relying on the inversion of the item's function as expressed by its title as well as its incongruous presence in an art exhibition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/3671180/Duchamps-Fountain-The-practical-joke-that-launched-an-artistic-revolution.html|first=Martin|last=Gayford|title=Duchamp's Fountain: The practical joke that launched an artistic revolution|date=16 February 2008|publisher=[[Telegraph Media Group|The Telegraph]]|accessdate=5 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Duchamp Fountaine.jpg|thumb|[[Marcel Duchamp]]'s ''[[Fountain (Duchamp)|Fountain]]'' (1917), an inverted urinal signed "R. Mutt".]]
==Etymology and development==
The word ''surreal'' first began to be used to describe a type of aesthetic of the early 1920s.

Surreal humour is also found frequently in avant-garde theatre such as ''[[Waiting for Godot]]'' and ''[[Rosencrantz &amp; Guildenstern Are Dead]]''. In the [[United States]], [[S. J. Perelman]] (1904-1979) has been identified as the first surrealist humour writer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Larry|last=McCaffery|authorlink=Larry McCaffery|date=1982|title=An interview with [[Donald Barthelme]]|journal=[[Partisan Review]]|volume=49|page=185|quote=People like SJ Perelman and EB White—people who could do certain amazing things in prose. Perelman was the first true American surrealist—ranking with the best in the world surrealist movement.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Surrealist humour is predominantly approached in cinema where the [[suspension of disbelief]] can be stretched to absurd lengths by logically following the consequences of unlikely, reversed or exaggerated premises. [[Luis Buñuel]] is a principal exponent of this, especially in ''[[The Exterminating Angel (film)|The Exterminating Angel]]''. Other examples include ''[[The Falls]]'' by [[Peter Greenaway]], "Free Time" by The Bogus Group, and ''[[Brazil (1985 film)|Brazil]]'' by [[Terry Gilliam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Vogel|first=Amos|title=Film as a Subversive Art|location=New York|publisher=[[Random House]]|date=2005|isbn=0-394-49078-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Williams|first=Linda|title=Figures of Desire: An Analysis of Surrealist Film|publisher=[[University of California Press]]|date=1992|isbn=0-520-07896-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today's [[Internet meme]] culture is also heavily influenced by surreal humor.

==Analysis==
Drs. Mary K. Rodgers and Diana Pien analysed the subject in an essay titled "Elephants and Marshmallows" (subtitled "A Theoretical Synthesis of Incongruity-Resolution and Arousal Theories of humour"), and wrote that "jokes are nonsensical when they fail to completely resolve incongruities," and cited one of the many permutations of the [[elephant joke]]: "Why did the elephant sit on the marshmallow?" "Because he didn't want to fall into the cup of hot chocolate."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Chapman|editor1-first=Antony J.|editor2-first=Hugh C.|editor2-last=Foot|title=It's A Funny Thing, Humor|publisher=Pergamon Press|date=1977|pages=37–40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"The joke is incompletely resolved in their opinion," noted [[Elliott Oring|Dr. Elliott Oring]], "because the situation is incompatible with the world as we know it. Certainly, elephants ''do not'' sit in cups of hot chocolate."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Oring|2003|pages=20–21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oring defined humour as not the resolution of incongruity, but "the perception of appropriate incongruity,"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Oring|2003|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; that all jokes contain a certain amount of incongruity, and that absurd jokes require the additional component of an "absurd image," with an incongruity of the mental image.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Oring|first=Elliott|title=Jokes and Their Relations|publisher=University Press of Kentucky|date=1992|pages=21–22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Tango''''' is a [[drama]] written by [[Poland|Polish]] writer, dramatist and cartoonist [[Sławomir Mrożek]] (1930–2013). It was first published in the literary magazine ''[[Dialog (magazine)|Dialog (Dialogue)]]'' in 1964. In Poland, ''Tango'' was staged for the first time in [[Bydgoszcz]] in 1965. The drama has been translated into English, Italian, Japanese, French, Danish, Hebrew, Czech, Slovenian, Dutch, Estonian, German, Spanish and other languages.&lt;ref name="Culture.pl"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldcat.org/search?q=Slawomir+Mrozek%2C+Tango&amp;qt=owc_search  Slawomir Mrozek, Tango.]&lt;!--languages confirmed--&gt; WorldCat Library Catalog, 2014. {{OCLC|266}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plot ==
 
The play is set in a non-defined time in the home of Stomil and Eleonora, parents of Artur (student of [[medicine]]). The place is disorganized not only in the way it is furnished, but also through the complete lack of house rules and common values. Everyone can do whatever they want. In addition, many unneeded objects like baby carriage, old wedding dress, catafalque after Artur grandfather's death, can be found in there. It seems that "perplexity" may be the word that describes their lives best. Despite that Artur’s attempts are bound to fail, he tries to make rules and grant some things meaning. Artur tries to coax his grandmother to use catafalque, revolts against his father slovenliness and his mother’s double standard of [[morality]]. He himself wants to have a traditional wedding, however he fails.&lt;ref name="Culture.pl"&gt;Michał Bujanowicz, [http://culture.pl/en/article/on-slawomir-mrozek-playwrights-tango  On Sławomir Mrożek - Playwright's Tango] by Culture.pl, January 30, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Artur when organising reception forgets about declaration of his feelings toward fiancee, so she thinks he’s indifferent and, in consequence, she claims she has an affair with Edek. Furthermore, his grandmother dies, and Artur is killed by Edek.  Drama ends with tango that symbolizes simple, primitive, [[mass culture]], which means those "values" won.  Edek announces that he takes control over place and everyone has to follow his rules from now on.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tango.klp.pl/a-5658.html  Tango - streszczenie (synopsis).] Kulturalna Polska. {{pl icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Tango" tells the story about generation gap in contemporary society and how [[conformity]], [[anarchy]], [[entropy]] and [[formalism (art)|formalism]] come into conflict between generations. It tries to focus on finding the answer whether there is any space for an intellectual in such community.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/203023.Tango  Tango.

The '''Tbilisi Circus''' ({{lang-ka|თბილისის ცირკი}}) is the main circus in [[Tbilisi]], the capital of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]. It is housed in a [[Stalinist architecture|Soviet-era Neoclassical]] [[Rotunda (architecture)|rotunda]] building built in 1939 on a hilltop overlooking [[Heroes's Square (Tbilisi)|Heroes' Square]].

== History ==
=== Early history ===
The history of the Tbilisi circus began in 1888, when the city was part of the [[Russian Empire]]. Its original big top building was destroyed in a fire in 1911 and the circus was moved to a former wine factory, before settling down, in 1939, in its present Neoclassical, [[Joseph Stalin]]-era building designed by Nikolay Neprintsev, Vladimer Urushadze, and Stepan Satunts. The building sit on a hill on the right bank of the [[Kura (Caspian Sea)|Kura river]], near what had been the end of the [[Georgian Military Road]] at the entrance of the city in the imperial era. The hill had also been known for a [[cast iron]] cross, named the Vera Cross after the historical neighborhood, erected in 1847 to commemorate the survival of the emperor [[Nicholas I of Russia|Nicholas I]] in a road accident during his visit to the [[Caucasus]] in 1837. The cross was demolished and the area around it was organized into Heroes' Square under the rule of [[Lavrenti Beria]] in the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rukhadze|first1=Ushangi|title=რომელ ცნობილ მოვლენას მიუძღვნეს ვერაზე ჯვრის დადგმა და რომელ ხიდს ამშვენებდნენ თამამშევის ქარვასლიდან წამოღებული გრიფონები|url=http://www.tbiliselebi.ge/?mas_id=268437617&amp;year=2013&amp;rubr_id=27&amp;jurn_id=16|website=Tbiliselebi|accessdate=January 11, 2015|language=Georgian|date=April 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; With its 2,000-seat capacity, the Tbilisi Circus was ranked among the largest circuses in the [[Soviet Union]], alongside those of [[Moscow State Circus|Moscow]], [[Kiev]], and [[Baku State Circus|Baku]].&lt;ref name=eu&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rimple|first1=Paul|last2=Mielnikiewicz|first2=Justyna|title=Georgia: The Tbilisi Circus Comes with Conflict Resolution, Plus Clowns|url=http://www.eurasianet.org/node/66521|website=EurasiaNet.org|accessdate=January 11, 2015|date=February 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Renovation ===
A civil unrest and economic collapse in post-Soviet Georgia terminated the circus's heyday in the 1990s. The building fell into disrepair and its territory became notorious for "after-hours" street prostitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Meyer|first1=William|last2=Costenbader|first2=Elizabeth C.|last3=Zule|first3=William A.|last4=Otiashvili|first4=David|last5=Kirtadze|first5=Irma|title=‘We are ordinary men’: MSM identity categories in Tbilisi, Georgia|journal=Culture, Health &amp; Sexuality|date=2010|volume=12|issue=8|pages=955-971|doi=10.1080/13691058.2010.516370|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13691058.2010.516370}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, the Georgian tycoon [[Badri Patarkatsishvili]] bought the circus and began an extensive reconstruction, but his involvement in the [[2007 Georgian demonstrations|2007 political crisis]] and death shortly thereafter stalled the renovations. His sister, Mzia Tortladze, was able to reopen the circus only in 2011. Since then, the circus has been playing to sellout crowds, bringing together troupes and performers from various parts of the world.&lt;ref name=eu/&gt;

On 23 January 1955 the privately owned Compagnie Luxembourgeoise de Télédiffusion (CLT) launched '''[[Luxembourg|Luxembourg's]]''' first '''[[television|television channel]]''', the French-language ''Télé Luxembourg''. 

CLT had on 1 July 1954 changed its name from the earlier Compagnie Luxembourgeoise de Radiodiffusion (CLR), founded in 1931.

In 1997, CLT merged with the [[Bertelsmann]] subsidiary [[UFA GmbH|UFA Film- und Fernseh GmbH]], based in [[Hamburg]], Germany, to create CLT-UFA.

In 2000, CLT-UFA merged with [[Pearson Television]] and became part of the [[RTL Group]], with its headquarters at [[Kirchberg, Luxembourg]].

== History ==
''Télé Luxembourg'' was inaugurated by [[Charlotte, Grand Duchess of Luxembourg|Grand Duchess Charlotte of Luxembourg]] on her 59th birthday together with her husband [[Prince Felix of Bourbon-Parma]]. The transmitter used was [[Dudelange Radio Tower|that at Dudelange]], adapted for television broadcasting.

In 1980 the station added the prefix ''RTL'' to its name to become ''RTL Télé Luxembourg''. It continued with this name until 1982 when it became ''RTL Télévision''. The station was receivable in [[Belgium]] until 11 September 1987 when the transmitting frequency used was given up to [[RTL-TVI|RTL-TVi]] and continued for [[Luxembourg]] and [[French people|French]] viewers until March 1991 when it then became ''RTL TV'' which had one variant in [[Lorraine (region)|Lorraine]] known as ''RTL Lorraine'', which lasted only until September 1991. Because of internal conflicts between the older and younger generations, who could not agree on the re-organisation of the station. ''RTL TV'' passed on its public service in Luxembourg on 21 October 1991 to ''RTL Hei Elei'', it kept this name until the autumn of 2001 when it was renamed ''RTL Télé Lëtzebuerg'', and it was joined by a second national station in 2004, ''Den 2. RTL''

== Programming in Luxembourgish==
Programming in the [[Luxembourgish language]] was inaugurated on 21 September 1969 with the launch of the weekly 45-minute "Hei Elei, Kuck Elei" (roughly translatable as: "Hey there, look at this"), which was broadcast every Sunday until 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.luxembourg.public.lu/en/le-grand-duche-se-presente/medias/medias-audiovisuels/television/index.html|title = The official portal of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg|accessdate = 2015-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari''''' ('''{{lang-de|Das Cabinet des Dr. Caligari}}''') is a 1920 German [[silent film|silent]] horror film, directed by [[Robert Wiene]] and written by [[Hans Janowitz]] and [[Carl Mayer]]. Considered the quintessential work of [[German Expressionism|German Expressionist]] cinema, it tells the story of an insane hypnotist ([[Werner Krauss]]) who uses a [[Sleepwalking|somnambulist]] ([[Conrad Veidt]]) to commit murders. The film features a dark and striking visual style, with sharp-pointed forms, oblique and curving lines, structures and landscapes that lean and twist in unusual angles, and shadows and streaks of light painted directly onto the sets.

The script was inspired by various experiences from the lives of Janowitz and Mayer, both [[pacifism|pacifists]] who were left distrustful of authority after their experiences with the military during [[World War I]]. The film's design was handled by [[Hermann Warm]], Walter Reimann and Walter Röhrig, who recommended a fantastic, graphic style over a naturalistic one. The film has been characterized as presenting themes on brutal and irrational authority; the destabilized contrast between insanity and sanity; the [[subjectivity|subjective perception]] of reality; and the duality of [[human nature]].

''The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari'' was released just as foreign film industries were easing restrictions on the import of German films following World War I, so it was screened internationally. Accounts differ as to its financial and critical success upon release, but modern film critics and historians have largely praised it as a revolutionary film. Critic [[Roger Ebert]] called it arguably "the first true horror film", and film reviewer [[Danny Peary]] called it cinema's first [[cult film]] and a precursor to [[Art film|arthouse films]]. Considered a classic, it helped draw worldwide attention to the artistic merit of German cinema and had a major influence on American films, particularly in the genres of horror and [[film noir]], introducing techniques such as the [[twist ending]] and the [[unreliable narrator]] to the language of narrative film.

==Plot==
As Francis ([[Friedrich Feher]]) sits on a bench with an older man who complains that spirits have driven him away from his family and home, a dazed woman named Jane ([[Lil Dagover]]) passes them. Francis explains she is his "fiancée" and that they have suffered a great ordeal. Most of the rest of the film is a [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] of Francis' story, which takes place in Holstenwall, a shadowy village of twisted buildings and spiraling streets. Francis and his friend Alan ([[Hans Heinrich von Twardowski]]), who are good-naturedly competing for Jane's affections, plan to visit the town fair. Meanwhile, a mysterious man named Dr. Caligari ([[Werner Krauss]]) seeks a permit from the rude town clerk to present a spectacle at the fair, which features a  [[Sleepwalking|somnambulist]] named Cesare ([[Conrad Veidt]]). The clerk mocks and berates Dr. Caligari, but ultimately approves the permit. That night, the clerk is found stabbed to death in his bed.

The next morning, Francis and Alan visit Dr. Caligari's spectacle, where he opens a coffin-like box to reveal the sleeping Cesare. Upon Dr. Caligari's orders, Cesare awakens and answers questions from the audience. Despite Francis's protests, Alan asks, "How long will I live?" To Alan's horror, Cesare answers, "Until dawn." Later that night, a figure breaks into Alan's home and stabs him to death in his bed. A grief-stricken Francis investigates Alan's murder with help from Jane and her father, Dr. Olsen ([[Rudolf Lettinger]]), who obtains police authorization to investigate the somnambulist. That night, the police apprehend a criminal in possession of a knife ([[Rudolf Klein-Rogge]]) who is caught attempting to murder an elderly woman. When questioned by Francis and Dr. Olson, the criminal confesses he tried to kill the elderly woman, but denies any part in the two previous deaths; he was merely taking advantage of the situation to divert blame onto the real murderer.

At night, Francis spies on Dr. Caligari and observes what appears to be Cesare sleeping in his box. However, the real Cesare sneaks into Jane's home as she sleeps. He raises a knife to stab her, but instead abducts her after a struggle, dragging her through the window onto the street. Chased by an angry mob, Cesare eventually drops Jane and flees; he soon collapses and dies. Francis also confirms that the caught criminal has been locked away and could not have been the attacker. Francis and the police investigate Dr. Caligari's sideshow and realize that the 'Cesare' sleeping in the box is only a dummy. Dr. Caligari escapes in the confusion. Francis follows and sees Caligari go through the entrance of an insane asylum.

Upon further investigation, Francis is shocked to learn that Dr. Caligari is the asylum's director. With help from the asylum staff, Francis studies the director's records and diary while the director is sleeping. The writings reveal his obsession with the story of an 18th-century mystic named Caligari, who used a somnambulist named Cesare to commit murders in northern Italian towns. The director, attempting to understand the earlier Caligari, experiments on a somnambulist admitted to the asylum, who becomes his Cesare. The director screams, "I must become Caligari!" Francis and the doctors call the police to Dr. Caligari's office, where they show him Cesare's corpse. Dr. Caligari then attacks one of the staff. He is subdued, restrained in a [[straitjacket]], and becomes an inmate in his own asylum.

The narrative returns to the present, where Francis concludes his story. In a [[Plot twist|twist ending]], Francis is depicted as an asylum inmate. Jane and Cesare are patients as well; Jane believes she is a queen, while Cesare is not a somnambulist but awake, quiet, and not visibly dangerous. The man Francis considers as "Dr. Caligari" is the asylum director. Francis attacks him and is restrained in a straitjacket, then placed in the same cell where Dr. Caligari was confined in Francis' story. The director announces that now he understands Francis' delusion. As such, he is confident he can cure him.

===Writing===
''The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari'' was written by [[Hans Janowitz]] and [[Carl Mayer]], both of whom were pacifists by the time they met following [[World War I]].&lt;ref name="Barlow32"&gt;{{Harvnb|Barlow|1982|p=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Brockmann61"&gt;{{Harvnb|Brockmann|2010|p=61}}&lt;/ref&gt; Janowitz served as an officer during the war, but the experience left him embittered with the military, which affected his writing.&lt;ref name="Towlson8"&gt;{{Harvnb|Towlson|2014|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Janowitz|1941|p=225}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mayer feigned madness to avoid military service during the war,&lt;ref name="Barlow32" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Janowitz227"&gt;{{Harvnb|Janowitz|1941|p=227}}&lt;/ref&gt; which led him to intense examinations from a military psychiatrist.&lt;ref name="Barlow32" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Brockmann61" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kracauer62"&gt;{{Harvnb|Kracauer|1947|p=62}}&lt;/ref&gt; The experience left him distrustful of authority,&lt;ref name="Barlow32" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Towlson8" /&gt; and the psychiatrist served as a model for the Dr. Caligari character.&lt;ref name="Kracauer63"&gt;{{Harvnb|Kracauer|1947|p=63}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Robinson9"&gt;{{Harvnb|Robinson|1997|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Janowitz and Mayer were introduced in June 1918 by a mutual friend, actor [[Ernst Deutsch]].&lt;ref name="Janowitz226"&gt;{{Harvnb|Janowitz|1941|p=226}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both writers were penniless at the time.&lt;ref name="Janowitz234"&gt;{{Harvnb|Janowitz|1941|p=234}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gilda Langer]], an actress with whom Mayer was in love, encouraged Janowitz and Mayer to write a film together. She later became the basis for the Jane character. Langer also encouraged Janowitz to visit a fortune teller, who predicted that Janowitz would survive his military service during the war, but Langer would die. This prediction proved true, as Langer died unexpectedly in 1920 at age 23, and Janowitz said it inspired the scene in which Cesare predicts Alan's death at the fair.&lt;ref name="Janowitz227" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Robinson|1997|pp=9–10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although neither had any associations with the film industry,&lt;ref name="Peary48"&gt;{{Harvnb|Peary|1988|p=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; Janowitz and Mayer wrote a script over six weeks during the winter of 1918–19.&lt;ref name="Janowitz233"&gt;{{Harvnb|Janowitz|1941|p=233}}&lt;/ref&gt; In describing their roles, Janowitz called himself "the father who planted the seed, and Mayer the mother who conceived and ripened it".&lt;ref name="Janowitz224"&gt;{{Harvnb|Janowitz|1941|p=224}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Expressionist filmmaker [[Paul Wegener]] was among their influences.&lt;ref name="Kracauer62" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Peary48" /&gt; The story was partially inspired by a circus sideshow the two visited on Kantstrasse in Berlin,&lt;ref name="Robinson9" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Peary49"&gt;{{Harvnb|Peary|1988|p=49}}&lt;/ref&gt; called "Man or Machine?", in which a man performed feats of great strength after becoming hypnotized.&lt;ref name="Kracauer62" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Janowitz233" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Peary49" /&gt; They first visualized the story of ''Caligari'' the night of that show.&lt;ref name="Kracauer62" /&gt; Several of Janowitz's past experiences influenced his writing, including memories of his hometown of [[Prague]],&lt;ref name="Robinson10" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Janowitz222"&gt;{{Harvnb|Janowitz|1941|p=222}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, as he put it, a mistrust of "the authoritative power of an inhuman state gone mad" due to his military service.&lt;ref name="Robinson10" /&gt; Janowitz also believed he had witnessed a murder in 1913 near an amusement park on [[Hamburg]]'s [[Reeperbahn]], beside the Holstenwall, which served as another inspiration for the script. According to Janowitz, he observed a woman disappear into some bushes, from which a respectable-looking man emerged a few moments later, and the next day Janowitz learned the girl was murdered.&lt;ref name="Barlow32" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Brockmann61" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Robinson10"&gt;{{Harvnb|Robinson|1997|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Peary|1988|pp=48–49}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kracauer61"&gt;{{Harvnb|Kracauer|1947|p=61}}&lt;/ref&gt; Holstenwall later became the name of the town setting in ''Caligari''.&lt;ref name="Barlow32" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Brockmann61" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Robinson10" /&gt;

Janowitz and Mayer are said to have set out to write a story denouncing arbitrary authority as brutal and insane.&lt;ref name="Barlow32" /&gt; Janowitz said it was only years after the film was released that he realized exposing the "authoritative power of an inhuman state" was the "subconscious intention" of the writers.&lt;ref name="Janowitz224" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Scheunemann126"&gt;{{Harvnb|Scheunemann|2003b|p=126}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Hermann Warm]], who designed the film's sets, said Mayer had no political intentions when he wrote the film.&lt;ref name="Barlow33"&gt;{{Harvnb|Barlow|1982|p=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Robinson32"&gt;{{Harvnb|Robinson|1997|p=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; Film historian David Robinson noted Janowitz did not refer to anti-authority intentions in the script until many decades after ''Caligari'' was released, and he suggested Janowitz's recollection may have changed in response to later interpretations to the film.&lt;ref name="Robinson32" /&gt; The film they wrote was entitled ''Das Cabinet des Dr. Caligari'', using the English spelling "Cabinet" rather than the German "Kabinett".&lt;ref name="Janowitz234" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Barlow29"&gt;{{Harvnb|Barlow|1982|p=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The completed script contained 141 scenes.&lt;ref name="Robinson16"&gt;{{Harvnb|Robinson|1997|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Janowitz has claimed the name "Caligari", which was not settled upon until after the script was finished, was inspired by a rare book called ‘’Unknown Letters of Stendhal'’, which featured a letter from the French novelist [[Stendhal]] referring to a French officer named Caligari he met at the [[La Scala]] theatre in [[Milan]].&lt;ref name="Barlow32" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kracauer63" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Janowitz234" /&gt; However, no record of any such letter exists, and film historian John D. Barlow suggested Janowitz may have fabricated the story.&lt;ref name="Barlow208"&gt;{{Harvnb|Barlow|1982|p=208}}&lt;/ref&gt; The physical appearance of Dr. Caligari was inspired by portraits of the German philosopher [[Arthur Schopenhauer]].&lt;ref name="Robinson11"&gt;{{Harvnb|Robinson|1997|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The character's name is spelled "Calligaris" in the only known surviving script, although in some instances the final "s" is removed. Other character names are also spelled differently from the final film: Cesare appears as "Caesare", Alan is "Allan" or sometimes "Alland" and Dr. Olfen is "Dr. Olfens". Likewise, unnamed characters in the final film have names in the script, including the town clerk ("Dr. Lüders") and the house-breaker ("Jakob Straat").&lt;ref name="Robinson13"&gt;{{Harvnb|Robinson|1997|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The story of ''Caligari'' is told abstractly, like a fairy tale, and includes little description about or attention toward the psychological motivations of the characters, which is more heavily emphasized in the film's visual style.&lt;ref name="Barlow45"&gt;{{Harvnb|Barlow|1982|p=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original script shows few traces of the [[German Expressionism|Expressionist]] influence prevalent in the film's sets and costumes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Scheunemann|2003a|pp=5–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through film director [[Fritz Lang]], Janowitz and Mayer met with [[Erich Pommer]], head of production at the [[Babelsberg Studio|Decla-Bioscop]] film studio, on 19 April 1919, to discuss selling the script.&lt;ref name="Peary49"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Robinson11" /&gt; According to Pommer, he attempted to get rid of them, but they persisted until he agreed to meet with them.&lt;ref name="Peary49"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Robinson11" /&gt; Pommer reportedly asked the writers to leave the script with him, but they refused, and instead Mayer read it aloud to him.&lt;ref name="Robinson11" /&gt; Pommer and his assistant, Julius Sternheim, were so impressed that he refused to let them leave until a contract was signed, and he purchased the script from them that night.&lt;ref name="Robinson11" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Janowitz229"&gt;{{Harvnb|Janowitz|1941|p=229}}&lt;/ref&gt; The writers had originally sought no fewer than 10,000 marks, but were given 3,500, with the promise of another 2,000 once the film went into production and 500 if it was sold for foreign release, which the producers considered unlikely.&lt;ref name="Janowitz229" /&gt; The contract, today preserved at Berlin's Bundesfilmarchiv, gave Pommer the right to make any changes to the script deemed appropriate. Pommer said he was drawn to the script because he believed it could be filmed inexpensively, and it bore similarities to films inspired by the macabre horror shows of the [[Grand Guignol]] theatre in Paris, which were popular at the time.&lt;ref name="Robinson11" /&gt; Pommer later said: "They saw in the script an 'experiment'. I saw a relatively cheap film".&lt;ref name="Robinson45"&gt;{{Harvnb|Robinson|1997|p=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Frame story====
''The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari'' makes use of a "Rahmenerzählung", or [[frame story]].&lt;ref name="Eisner20" &gt;{{Harvnb|Eisner|1974|p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both a prologue and epilogue establish the main body of the film as a delusional flashback,&lt;ref name="Eisner20" /&gt; an innovative technique at the time.&lt;ref name="LoBrutto62"&gt;{{Harvnb|LoBrutto|2005|p=62}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kaes54"&gt;{{Harvnb|Kaes|2006|p=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lang has said that, during early discussions about his possible involvement with the film, he suggested the addition of an opening scene with a "normal" style, which would lead the public into the rest of the film without confusion.&lt;ref name="Barlow33" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Scheunemann127"&gt;{{Harvnb|Scheunemann|2003b|p=127}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Robinson31"&gt;{{Harvnb|Robinson|1997|p=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it remains unclear whether Lang suggested the frame story structure itself, or simply gave advice on how to write a frame story that was already agreed upon,&lt;ref name="Barlow33" /&gt; and some writers, like David Robinson, have questioned whether Lang's recollection is correct.&lt;ref name="Robinson31" /&gt; Director [[Robert Wiene]] was supportive of the changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kracauer|1947|p=66}}&lt;/ref&gt; Janowitz has claimed he and Mayer were not privy to discussions about adding the frame story and strongly opposed its inclusion, believing it had deprived the film of its revolutionary and political significance;&lt;ref name="Barlow33" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Robinson13" /&gt; he wrote that it was "an illicit violation, a raping of our work" that turned the film "into a cliché ... in which the symbolism was to be lost".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Janowitz|1941|pp=236–237}}&lt;/ref&gt; Janowitz claims the writers sought legal action to stop the change, but were unsuccessful.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Janowitz|1941|p=236}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also claims they did not see the finished film with the frame story until a preview was shown to studio heads, after which the writers "expressed our dissatisfaction in a storm of thunderous remonstrances". They had to be persuaded not to publicly protest the film.&lt;ref name="Janowitz237"&gt;{{Harvnb|Janowitz|1941|p=237}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1947 book ''[[From Caligari to Hitler]]'', [[Siegfried Kracauer]] argued, based largely on an unpublished typescript written and provided by Janowitz,&lt;ref name="Kracauer61" /&gt; that the film originally included no frame story at all and only the main story, starting with the fair coming to town and ending with Dr. Caligari becoming institutionalized.&lt;ref name="Barlow32" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kracauer67"&gt;{{Harvnb|Kracauer|1947|p=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Brockmann60-61"&gt;{{Harvnb|Brockmann|2010|pp=60–61}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Budd28"&gt;{{Harvnb|Budd|1990b|p=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kracauer argued the frame story glorified authority and was added to turn a "revolutionary" film into a "conformistic" one.&lt;ref name="Barlow32" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kracauer67" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Brockmann60-61" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Budd28" /&gt; (See the [[The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari#Authority and conformity|Themes section]] for more.) No surviving copies of the script were believed to exist to confirm this fact, until the early 1950s when actor [[Werner Krauss]] revealed he still had his copy.&lt;ref name="Robinson13" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Budd28" /&gt; Krauss refused to part with it, and it was not until 1978, after his death, that it was purchased by the German film archive [[Deutsche Kinemathek]].&lt;ref name="Robinson13" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Budd28" /&gt; It remained unavailable for public consumption until 1995, when a full transcript was published.&lt;ref name="Robinson13" /&gt;

The script revealed that a frame story indeed was part of the original ''Caligari'' screenplay, albeit a significantly different one than that in the final film.&lt;ref name="Barlow32" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Brockmann61" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Budd28" /&gt; The original manuscript opens on an elegant terrace of a large villa, where Francis and Jane are hosting a party, and the guests insist that Francis tell them a story that happened to him 20 years earlier. The conclusion to the frame story is missing from the script.&lt;ref name="Barlow32" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Budd28" /&gt; Critics widely agree that the discovery of the screenplay strongly undermines Kracauer's theory,&lt;ref name="Scheunemann127" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Budd28" /&gt; with some, like German film historian Stephen Brockmann, even arguing it disproves his claims altogether.&lt;ref name="Brockmann61" /&gt; Others, however, like John D. Barlow, argues it does not completely settle the issue, as the original screenplay's frame story simply serves to introduce the main plot, rather than subvert it as the final film's version does.&lt;ref name="Barlow32" /&gt;

===Development===
Many details about the making of ''The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari'' are in dispute and will probably remain unsettled due to the large number of people involved in the making of the film, many of whom have recalled it differently or dramatized their own contributions to its production.&lt;ref name="Barlow34"&gt;{{Harvnb|Barlow|1982|p=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Robinson7"&gt;{{Harvnb|Robinson|1997|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Eisner17-18"&gt;{{Harvnb|Eisner|1974|pp=17–18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Budd|1990b|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Production of the film was delayed about four or five months after the script was purchased.&lt;ref name="Robinson11" /&gt; Pommer originally chose Lang as the director of ''Caligari'', and Lang even went so far as to hold preparatory discussions about the script with Janowitz,&lt;ref name="Robinson11" /&gt; but he became unavailable due to his involvement with the filming of ''[[The Spiders (film)|The Spiders]]'', so Wiene was selected instead.&lt;ref name="Eisner20" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Peary50"&gt;{{Harvnb|Peary|1988|p=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Finler70"&gt;{{Harvnb|Finler|1997|p=70}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kobel|2007|p=83}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Janowitz, Wiene's father, a successful theatre actor, had "gone slightly mad when he could no longer appear on the stage", and Janowitz believed that experience helped Wiene bring an "intimate understanding" to the source material of ''Caligari''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Janowitz|1941|p=228}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The Cabinet of Dr Caligari Holstenwall.png|thumb|right|The designers of ''The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari'' chose a fantastic, graphic visual style instead of a naturalistic one. This included twisted city scenes that were painted directly onto canvases.]]
Decla producer [[Rudolf Meinert]] introduced Hermann Warm to Wiene and provided Warm the ''Caligari'' script, asking him to come up with proposals for the design.&lt;ref name="Robinson22"&gt;{{Harvnb|Robinson|1997|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Warm believed "films must be drawings brought to life",&lt;ref name="Kracauer76"&gt;{{Harvnb|Kracauer|1947|p=68}}&lt;/ref&gt; and felt a naturalistic set was wrong for the subject of the film, instead recommending a fantastic, graphic style,&lt;ref name="Barlow33" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Robinson22" /&gt; in which the images would be visionary, nightmarish and out of the ordinary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Barlow|1982|pp=40–41}}&lt;/ref&gt; Warm brought to the project his two friends, painters and stage designers [[Walter Reimann]] and [[Walter Röhrig]],&lt;ref name="Barlow33" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Eisner19"&gt;{{Harvnb|Eisner|1974|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Thomson139"&gt;{{Harvnb|Thomson|2008|p=139}}&lt;/ref&gt; both of whom were associated with the Berlin art and literary magazine ''[[Der Sturm]]''.&lt;ref name="Barlow33" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kracauer76"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Budd26"&gt;{{Harvnb|Budd|1990b|p=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trio spent a full day and part of the night reading the script,&lt;ref name="Eisner19" /&gt; after which Reimann suggested an Expressionist style,&lt;ref name="Barlow33" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Eisner19" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Brockmann60"&gt;{{Harvnb|Brockmann|2010|p=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; a style often used in his own paintings.&lt;ref name="Robinson22" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Eisner19" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Brockmann60" /&gt; They also conceived the idea of painting forms and shadows directly onto the sets to ensure a dark and unreal look.&lt;ref name="Barlow33" /&gt; (See [[The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari#Visual Style|Visual Style]] for more.) According to Warm, the three approached Wiene with the idea and he immediately agreed,&lt;ref name="Barlow33" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Eisner19" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Robinson|1997|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; although Wiene has made claims that he conceived the film's Expressionist style.&lt;ref name="Eisner19" /&gt; Meinert agreed to the idea after one day's consideration, telling Warm, Reimann and Röhrig to make the sets as "crazy" and "eccentrically" as possible.&lt;ref name="Robinson45" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Eisner19" /&gt; He embraced the idea for commercial, not aesthetic reasons: Expressionism was fashionable at the time, so he concluded even if film received bad reviews, the artistic style would garner attention and make it profitable.&lt;ref name="Robinson45" /&gt;

Wiene filmed a test scene to demonstrate Warm, Reimann, and Röhrig's theories, and it so impressed the producers that the artists were given free rein.&lt;ref name="Peary50"/&gt; Pommer later said he was responsible for placing Warm, Reimann and Röhrig in charge of the sets.&lt;ref name="Robinson20"&gt;{{Harvnb|Robinson|1997|p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; But Warm has claimed that, although Pommer was in charge of production at Decla when ''Caligari'' was made, he was not actually a producer on the film itself. Instead, he says Meinert was the film's true producer, and that it was he who gave Warm the manuscript.&lt;ref name="Barlow33" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Eisner19" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Robinson21"&gt;{{Harvnb|Robinson|1997|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Warm claimed Meinert produced the film "despite the opposition of a part of the management of Decla."&lt;ref name="Robinson22" /&gt; Meinert said Pommer had "not sanctioned" the film's abstract visual style.&lt;ref name="Robinson21" /&gt; Nevertheless, Pommer claimed to have supervised ''Caligari'', and that the film's Expressionistic style was chosen in part to differentiate it from competing [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] films.&lt;ref name="Brockmann60-61" /&gt; The predominant attitude at the time was that artistic achievement led to success in exports to foreign film markets.&lt;ref name="Kracauer65"&gt;{{Harvnb|Kracauer|1947|p=65}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dominance of Hollywood at the time, coupled with a period of inflation and currency devaluation, forced German film studios to seek projects that could be made inexpensively, with a combination of realistic and artistic elements so the films would be accessible to American audiences, yet also distinctive from Hollywood films.&lt;ref name="Kracauer65" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Budd|1990b|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pommer has claimed while Mayer and Janowitz expressed a desire for artistic experimentation in the film, his decision to use painted canvases as scenery was primarily a commercial one, as they would be a significant financial saving over building sets.&lt;ref name="Peary49" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Eisner18"&gt;{{Harvnb|Eisner|1974|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Janowitz claims he attempted to commission the sets from designer and engraver [[Alfred Kubin]], known for his heavy use of light and shadow to create a sense of chaos,&lt;ref name="Janowitz222" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kracauer67" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Budd32"&gt;{{Harvnb|Budd|1990b|p=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Kubin declined to participate in the project because he was too busy.&lt;ref name="Janowitz222" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Robinson20" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Eisner18" /&gt; In a conflicting story, however, Janowitz claimed he requested from Decla "Kubin paintings", and that they misread his instructions as "[[cubism|cubist]] painters" and hired Reimann and Röhrig as a result.&lt;ref name="Janowitz222" /&gt; David Robinson argues this story was probably an embellishment stemming from Janowitz's disdain for the two artists.&lt;ref name="Robinson20" /&gt; Janowitz has claimed that he and Mayer conceived the idea of painting the sets on canvas, and that the shooting script included written directions that the scenery be designed in Kubin's style.&lt;ref name="Janowitz222" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Robinson20" /&gt; However, the later rediscovery of the original screenplay refutes this claim, as it includes no such directions about the sets.&lt;ref name="Robinson20" /&gt; This was also disputed in a 1926 article by Barnet Braverman in ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' magazine, which claimed the script included no mention of an unconventional visual style, and that Janowitz and Mayer in fact strongly opposed the stylization. She claims Mayer later came to appreciate the visual style, but that Janowitz remained opposed to it years after the film's release.&lt;ref name="Robinson21" /&gt;

The set design, costumes and props took about two weeks to prepare.&lt;ref name="Robinson24"&gt;{{Harvnb|Robinson|1997|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Warm worked primarily on the sets, while Röhrig handled the painting and Reimann was responsible for the costumes.&lt;ref name="Barlow34" /&gt; Robinson noted the costumes in ''Caligari'' seem to resemble a wide variety of time periods. For example, Dr. Caligari and the fairground workers' costumes resemble the [[Biedermeier]] era, while Jane's embody [[Romanticism]]. Additionally, Robinson wrote, Cesare's costume and those of  policemen in the film appear abstract, while many of the other characters seem like ordinary German clothes from the 1920s.&lt;ref name="Robinson28"&gt;{{Harvnb|Robinson|1997|p=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The collaborative nature of the film's production highlights the importance that both screenwriters and set designers held in German cinema of the 1920s,&lt;ref name="Barlow34" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Eisner19" /&gt; although film critic [[Lotte H. Eisner]] said sets held more importance than anything else in German films at that time.&lt;ref name="Eisner19" /&gt; ''The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari'' was the first German Expressionist film,&lt;ref name="Barlow29" /&gt; although Brockmann and film critic Mike Budd claims it was also influenced by [[German Romanticism]];&lt;ref name="Brockmann64"&gt;{{Harvnb|Brockmann|2010|p=64}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Budd16"&gt;{{Harvnb|Budd|1990b|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Budd notes the film's themes of insanity and the outcry against authority are common among German Romanticism in literature, theatre and the visual arts.&lt;ref name="Budd16" /&gt; Film scholar Vincent LoBrutto said the theatre of [[Max Reinhardt]] and the artistic style of [[Die Brücke]] were additional influences on ''Caligari''.&lt;ref name="LoBrutto61"&gt;{{Harvnb|LoBrutto|2005|p=61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Casting===
[[File:The Cabinet of Dr Caligari Werner Krauss.png|thumb|left|[[Werner Krauss]], who portrayed Dr. Caligari, suggested changes to his own make-up and costumes so they would match the film's Expressionist style.]]
Janowitz originally intended the part of Cesare to go to his friend, actor [[Ernst Deutsch]].&lt;ref name="Janowitz226" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Robinson12" /&gt; Mayer wrote the part of Jane for Gilda Langer,&lt;ref name="Robinson12" /&gt; but by the time the film was cast Langer's interests had moved on from Janowitz and Mayer to director [[Paul Czinner]], leaving the role to be played by Lil Dagover.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |last=Kalat |first=David |date=2014 |title=The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari |medium=Audio commentary |time=0:20:47 |location=United Kingdom |publisher=Eureka Entertainment |series=Masters of Cinema |url=https://www.eurekavideo.co.uk/moc/das-cabinet-des-dr-caligari |quote=... she didn't miss out on Caligari because she was dead. She was actually alive during the entire production. Torn between Mayer and Janowitz, Gilda Langer took the chance to trade up from a pair of starving writers in favor of an up-and-coming director and producer named Paul Czinner. By marrying Czinner, Gilda effectively left their orbit ... }}&lt;/ref&gt; Janowitz claimed he wrote the part of Dr. Caligari specifically for Werner Krauss, whom Deutsch had brought to his attention during rehearsals for a Max Reinhardt play; Janowitz said only Krauss or [[Paul Wegener]] could have played the part.&lt;ref name="Janowitz226" /&gt; The parts of Dr. Caligari and Cesare ultimately went to Krauss and [[Conrad Veidt]], respectively, who enthusiastically took part in many aspects of the production.&lt;ref name="Barlow34" /&gt; Krauss suggested changes to his own make-up and costumes, including the elements of a top hat, cape, and walking stick with an ivory handle for his character.&lt;ref name="Robinson41"&gt;{{Harvnb|Robinson|1997|p=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; The actors in ''Caligari'' were conscious of the need to adapt their make-up, costumes, and appearance to match the visual style of the film.&lt;ref name="Robinson40"&gt;{{Harvnb|Robinson|1997|p=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the acting in German silent films at the time was already Expressionistic, mimicking the pantomimic aspects of Expressionist theatre.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Barlow|1982|p=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; The performances of Krauss and Veidt in ''Caligari'' were typical of this style, as they both had experience in Expressionist-influenced theatre, and as a result John D. Barlow said they appear more comfortable in their surroundings in the film than the other actors.&lt;ref name="Barlow43" /&gt; Prior to filming, Kraus and Veidt appeared on stage in the winter of 1918 in an Expressionist drama, [[Reinhold Goering]]'s ''[[Seeschlacht]]'', at the Deutsches Theater.&lt;ref name="Robinson40" /&gt; By contrast, Dagover had little experience in Expressionist theatre, and Barlow argues her acting is less harmonious with the film's visual style.&lt;ref name="Barlow43" /&gt;

Wiene asked the actors to make movements similar to dance, most prominently from Veidt, but also from Krauss, Dagover and Friedrich Feger, who played Francis.&lt;ref name="Thomson139" /&gt; Krauss and Veidt are the only actors whose performances fully match the stylization of the sets, which they achieved by concentrating their movements and facial expressions.&lt;ref name="Eisner25" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Budd38"&gt;{{Harvnb|Budd|1990b|p=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barlow notes that "Veidt moves along the wall as if it had 'exuded' him ... more a part of a material world of objects than a human one", and Krauss "moves with angular viciousness, his gestures seem broken or cracked by the obsessive force within him, a force that seems to emerge from a constant toxic state, a twisted authoritarianism of no human scruple and total insensibility".&lt;ref name="Barlow43" /&gt; Most of the other actors besides Krauss and Veidt have a more naturalistic style.&lt;ref name="Eisner25" /&gt; Alan, Jane and Francis play the roles of an idyllically happy trio enjoying youth; Alan in particular represents the archetype of a sensitive 19th century student.&lt;ref name="Barlow43-45" /&gt; Mike Budd points out realist characters in stylized settings are a common characteristic in Expressionist theatre.&lt;ref name="Budd38" /&gt; However, David Robinson notes even the performances of the more naturalistic supporting roles in ''Caligari'' have Expressionist elements, like Hans-Heinz von Twardowski's "strange, tormented face" as Alan. He also cites Feher's "large angular movements," especially in the scene where he searches the deserted fairground.&lt;ref name="Robinson41" /&gt; Other minor roles are Expressionistic in nature, like two policemen who sit facing each other at their desks and move with exaggerated symmetry, and two servants who awaken and rise from their beds in perfect synchronization.&lt;ref name="Robinson41" /&gt; Vincent LoBrutto said of the acting in the film:&lt;ref name="LoBrutto64" /&gt;

{{pull quote|The acting style is as emotionally over-the-top as the narrative and visual style of ''The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari''. The behavior of the characters represents the actors' emotional responses to the expressionistic environment and the situations in which they find themselves. Staging and movement of the actors respond to the hysteria of Caligari's machinations and to the fun-house labyrinth that appears to be the reflection of a crazy mirror, not an orderly village.}}

===Filming===
Shooting for ''The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari'' began at the end of December 1919 and concluded at the end of January 1920.&lt;ref name="Robinson24" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Schenk"&gt;{{cite news |last=Schenk |first=Ralf |title=Die Spukpioniere von Weißensee |work=[[Berliner Zeitung]] |date=4 September 2010  |language=German |url=http://www.berliner-zeitung.de/archiv/vor-knapp-hundert-jahren-drehten-die-grossen-deutschen-stars-und-auch-die-sternchen-im-berliner-norden--die-spukpioniere-von-weissensee,10810590,10740438.html |accessdate=10 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was shot entirely in a studio without any exterior shots,&lt;ref name="Brockmann62"&gt;{{Harvnb|Brockmann|2010|p=62}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kaes47"&gt;{{Harvnb|Kaes|2006|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LoBrutto63"&gt;{{Harvnb|LoBrutto|2005|p=63}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was unusual for films of the time, but dictated by the decision to give the film an Expressionist visual style.&lt;ref name="Robinson25"&gt;{{Harvnb|Robinson|1997|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The extent to which Mayer and Janowitz participated during filming is disputed: Janowitz claims the duo repeatedly refused to allow any script changes during production, and Pommer claimed Mayer was on the set for every day of filming.&lt;ref name="Robinson12" /&gt; But Hermann Warm claimed they were never present for any of the shooting or involved in any discussions during production.&lt;ref name="Barlow34" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Robinson12"&gt;{{Harvnb|Robinson|1997|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Caligari'' was filmed in the Lixie-Atelier film studio (formerly owned by [[Continental-Kunstfilm]]) at 9 Franz Joseph-Strasse (now Max Liebermannstraße), [[Weissensee (Berlin)|Weißensee]], a north-eastern suburb of Berlin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Instead, the scenes use a painting of the Holstenwall town as a background; throngs of people walk around two spinning merry-go-round props, which creates the impression of a carnival.&lt;ref name="Robinson28" /&gt; The script also made references to modern elements like telephones, telegrams and electric light, but they were eliminated during the filming, leaving the final film's setting with no indication of a specific time period.&lt;ref name="Robinson28" /&gt;

[[File:Ende V. Akt Das Cabinet des Dr. Caligari.jpg|thumb|right|''The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari'' used stylised intertitles.]]Several scenes from the script were cut during filming, most of which were brief time lapses or transitioning scenes, or title screens deemed unnecessary.&lt;ref name="Robinson28" /&gt; One of the more substantial scenes to be cut involved the ghost of Alan at a cemetery.&lt;ref name="Robinson28" /&gt; The scene with the town clerk berating Dr. Caligari deviated notably from the original script, which simply called for the clerk to be "impatient".&lt;ref name="Robinson28" /&gt; He is far more abusive in the scene as it was filmed, and is perched atop an exaggeratedly high bench that towers over Dr. Caligari.&lt;ref name="Robinson28" /&gt; Another deviation from the script comes when Dr. Caligari first awakens Cesare, one of the most famous moments in the film. The script called for Cesare to gasp and struggle for air, then shake violently and collapse in Dr. Caligari's arms. As it was filmed, there is no such physical struggling, and instead the camera zooms in on Cesare's face as he gradually opens his eyes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Robinson|1997|pp=63–65}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original [[Intertitle|title cards]] for ''Caligari'' featured stylized, misshapen lettering with excessive underlinings, exclamation points and occasionally archaic spellings. The bizarre style, which matches that of the film as a whole, mimics the lettering of Expressionistic posters at the time.&lt;ref name="Barlow39"&gt;{{Harvnb|Barlow|1982|p=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Eisner21"&gt;{{Harvnb|Eisner|1974|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original title cards were tinted in green, steely-blue and brown. Many modern prints of the film do not preserve the original lettering.&lt;ref name="Eisner21" /&gt;

Photography was provided by [[Willy Hameister]], who went on to work with Wiene on several other films.&lt;ref name="Brockmann60" /&gt; The camera does not play a large part in ''Caligari'', and is used primarily to show the sets.&lt;ref name="Barlow45" /&gt;&lt;ref name="LoBrutto64"&gt;{{Harvnb|LoBrutto|2005|p=64}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cinematography tends to alternate only between medium shots at straight-on angles and abrupt close-ups to create a sense of shock, but with few long shots or panning movement.&lt;ref name="LoBrutto64" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kaes|2006|pp=47–48}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, there is very little interscene editing. Most scenes follow the other without intercutting, which gives ''Caligari'' a more theatrical feel than a cinematic one.&lt;ref name="LoBrutto64" /&gt; Heavy lighting is typically absent from the film, heightening the sense of darkness prevalent in the story. However, lighting is occasionally used to intensify the uneasiness created by the distortions of the sets. For example, when Cesare first awakens at the fair, a light is shone directly on a close-up of his heavily made-up face to create an unsettling glow.&lt;ref name="Barlow38-39"&gt;{{Harvnb|Barlow|1982|pp=38–39}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, lighting is used in a then-innovative way to cast a shadow against the wall during the scene in which Cesare kills Alan, so the viewer sees only the shadow and not the figures themselves. Lighting techniques like this became frequently used in later German films.&lt;ref name="Peary51"&gt;{{Harvnb|Peary|1988|p=51}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kracauer|1947|p=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Visual style==
[[Image:CABINET DES DR CALIGARI 01.jpg|thumb|right|The visual style of ''The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari'' included deliberately distorted forms, and shadows and streaks of light painted directly onto the sets.]]
The visual style of ''The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari'' is dark, twisted and bizarre; radical and deliberate distortions in perspective, form, dimension and scale create a chaotic and unhinged appearance.&lt;ref name="Barlow33" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Peary50" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Thomson139" /&gt; The sets are dominated by sharp-pointed forms and oblique and curving lines, with narrow and spiraling streets,&lt;ref name="Eisner21" /&gt;  and structures and landscapes that lean and twist in unusual angles, giving the impression they could collapse or explode at any given moment.&lt;ref name="Barlow33" /&gt;&lt;ref name="LoBrutto63" /&gt; Film critic [[Roger Ebert]] described it as "a jagged landscape of sharp angles and tilted walls and windows, staircases climbing crazy diagonals, trees with spiky leaves, grass that looks like knives".&lt;ref name="Ebert"&gt;{{cite web |last=Ebert |first=Roger |authorlink=Roger Ebert |title=The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari |publisher=[[Roger Ebert|RogerEbert.com]] | date=3 June 2009 |url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/great-movie-the-cabinet-of-dr-caligari-1920 |accessdate=10 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sets are characterized by strokes of bold, black paint.&lt;ref name="LoBrutto63" /&gt; The landscape of Holstenwall is painted on canvas, as opposed to a constructed set, and shadows and streaks of light are painted directly onto the sets, further distorting the viewer's sense of perspective and three-dimensionality.&lt;ref name="Barlow38-39" /&gt; Buildings are clustered and interconnected in a cubist-like architecture, surrounded by dark and twisted back alleys.&lt;ref name="Janowitz222" /&gt;&lt;ref name="LoBrutto64" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Eisner21" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Budd|1990b|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lotte Eisner, author of ''The Haunted Screen'', writes that objects in the film appear as if they are coming alive and "seem to vibrate with an extraordinary spirituality".&lt;ref name="Eisner21" /&gt; Likewise, ''Expressionismus und Film'' writer Rudolf Kurtz wrote "the dynamic force of objects howls their desire to be created".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Eisner|1974|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rooms have radically offset windows with distorted frames, doors that are not squared, and chairs that are too tall.&lt;ref name="Peary50" /&gt;&lt;ref name="LoBrutto64" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Eisner21" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Barlow36"&gt;{{Harvnb|Barlow|1982|p=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; Strange designs and figures are painted on the walls of corridors and rooms, and trees outside have twisted branches that sometimes resemble tentacles.&lt;ref name="Barlow36" /&gt;

As German film professor Anton Kaes wrote, "The style of German Expressionism allowed the filmmakers to experiment with filmic technology and special effects and to explore the twisted realm of repressed desires, unconscious fears, and deranged fixations".&lt;ref name="Kaes57"&gt;{{Harvnb|Kaes|2006|p=57}}&lt;/ref&gt; The visual style of ''Caligari'' conveys a sense of anxiety and terror to the viewer,&lt;ref name="Eisner21" /&gt; giving the impression of a nightmare or deranged sensibility,&lt;ref name="Barlow33" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Thomson139" /&gt; or a place transformed by evil, in a more effective way than realistic locations or conventional design concepts could.&lt;ref name="LoBrutto64" /&gt; Siegfried Kracauer wrote that the settings "amounted to a perfect transformation of material objects into emotional ornaments".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kracauer|1947|p=69}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of the film's story and scenes are memories recalled by an insane narrator, and as a result the distorted visual style takes on the quality of his mental breakdown,&lt;ref name="Barlow37"&gt;{{Harvnb|Barlow|1982|p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; giving the viewers the impression that they are inside the mind of a madman.&lt;ref name="Barlow39" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kracauer70"&gt;{{Harvnb|Kracauer|1947|p=70}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bordwell|Thompson|2009|p=461}}&lt;/ref&gt; As with German Expressionist paintings, the visual style of ''Caligari'' reflects an emotional reaction to world,&lt;ref name="LoBrutto62" /&gt; and in the case of the film's characters represents an emotional response to the terror of society that Dr. Caligari and Cesare represent.&lt;ref name="LoBrutto63" /&gt; Often in the film, set pieces are emblematic of the emotional state of the characters in the scene. For example, the courtyard of the insane asylum during the frame story is vastly out of proportion. The characters seem too big for the small building, and the courtyard floor features a bizarre pattern, all of which represent the patients' damaged frames of mind.&lt;ref name="Brockmann64" /&gt; Likewise, the scene with the criminal in a prison cell features a set with long vertical painted shadows resembling arrowheads, pointing down at the squatting prisoner in an oppressive effect that symbolizes his broken-down state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Eisner|1974|pp=24–25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stephen Brockmann argues the fact that ''Caligari'' was filmed entirely in a studio enhances the madness portrayed by the film's visuals because "there is no access to a natural world beyond the realm of the tortured human psyche".&lt;ref name="Brockmann62" /&gt; The sets occasionally feature circular images that reflect the chaos of the film, presenting patterns of movement that seem to be going nowhere, such as the merry-go-round at the fair, moving at a titled angle that makes it appear at risk of collapsing.&lt;ref name="Barlow49"&gt;{{Harvnb|Barlow|1982|p=49}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other elements of the film convey the same visual motifs as the sets, including the costumes and make-up design for Dr. Caligari and Cesare, both of which are highly exaggerated and grotesque. Even the hair of the characters is an Expressionistic design element, especially Cesare's black, spiky, jagged locks.&lt;ref name="LoBrutto64" /&gt; They are the only two characters in the film with Expressionistic make-up and costumes,&lt;ref name="Budd38" /&gt; making them appear as if they are the only ones who truly belong in this distorted world. Despite their apparent normalcy, however, Francis and the other characters never appear disturbed by the madness around them reflected in the sets; they instead react as if they are parts of a normal background.&lt;ref name="Barlow38"&gt;{{Harvnb|Barlow|1982|p=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A select few scenes disrupt the Expressionistic style of the film, such as in Jane's and Alan's home, which include normal backgrounds and bourgeois furniture that convey a sense of security and tranquility otherwise absent from the film.&lt;ref name="Barlow37" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Barlow49" /&gt; Eisner called this a "fatal" continuity error,&lt;ref name="Eisner25"&gt;{{Harvnb|Eisner|1974|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; but John D. Barlow disagrees, arguing it is a common characteristic for dream narratives to have some normal elements in them, and that the normalcy of Jane's house in particular could represent the feeling of comfort and refuge Francis feels in her presence.&lt;ref name="Eisner25" /&gt; Mike Budd argues while the Expressionistic visual style is jarring and off-putting at first, the characters start to blend more harmoniously as the film progresses, and the setting becomes more relegated into the background.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Budd|1990b|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Robinson suggested ''Caligari'' is not a true example of Expressionism at all, but simply a conventional story with some elements of the art form applied to it. He argues the story itself is not Expressionistic, and the film could have easily been produced in a traditional style, but that Expressionist-inspired visuals were applied to it as decoration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Robinson|1997|pp=38–39}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Budd has called the film a conventional, classical narrative, resembling a [[Detective fiction|detective story]] in Francis's search to expose Alan's killer, and said it is only the film's Expressionist settings that make the film transgressive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Budd|1990b|pp=11–12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hans Janowitz has entertained similar thoughts as well: "Was this particular style of painting only a garment in which to dress the drama? Was it only an accident? Would it not have been possible to change this garment, without injury to the deep effect of the drama? I do not know."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Janowitz|1941|p=223}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Release==
[[File:The Cabinet of Dr Caligari Conrad Veidt.png|thumb|left|The premiere of ''The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari'' was so successful, women in the audience were said to have screamed during the famous scene in which Cesare ([[Conrad Veidt]]) is revealed.]]
Though often considered an [[art film]] by modern audiences, ''Caligari'' was produced and marketed the same way as a normal commercial production of its time period, able to target both the elite artistic market as well as a more commercial horror genre audience.&lt;ref name="Robinson43"&gt;{{Harvnb|Robinson|1997|p=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Budd23"&gt;{{Harvnb|Budd|1990b|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was marketed extensively leading up to the release, and advertisements ran even before the film was finished. Many posters and newspaper advertisements included the enigmatic phrase featured in the film, "Du musst Caligari werden!", or "You must become Caligari!"&lt;ref name="Robinson46"&gt;{{Harvnb|Robinson|1997|p=46}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kracauer71"&gt;{{Harvnb|Kracauer|1947|p=71}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Caligari'' premiered at the Marmorhaus theatre in Berlin on 26 February 1920, less than one month after it was completed.&lt;ref name="Robinson46" /&gt; The filmmakers were so nervous about the release that Erich Pommer, on his way to the theatre, reportedly exclaimed, "It will be a horrible failure for all of us!"&lt;ref name="Janowitz237" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Robinson47"&gt;{{Harvnb|Robinson|1997|p=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; As with the making of the film, several urban legends surround the film's premiere.&lt;ref name="Robinson46" /&gt; One, offered by writers [[Roger Manvell]] and [[Heinrich Fraenkel]] in ''The German Cinema'', suggest the film was shelved "for lack of a suitable outlet", and was only shown at Marmorhaus because another film had fallen through.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Manvell|Fraenkel|1971|p=137}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another suggested the theatre pulled the film after only two performances because audiences demanded refunds and demonstrated against it so strongly. This story was told by Pommer, who claimed the Marmorhaus picked ''Caligari'' back up and ran it successfully for three months after he spent six months working on a publicity campaign for the film. David Robinson wrote that neither of these urban legends were true, and that the latter was fabricated by Pommer to increase his own reputation.&lt;ref name="Robinson46" /&gt; On the contrary, Robinson said the premiere was highly successful, showing at the theatre for four weeks, an unusual amount for the time, and then returning two weeks later. He said it was so well received that women in the audience screamed when Cesare opened his eyes during his first scene, and fainted during the scene in which Cesare abducts Jane.&lt;ref name="Janowitz237" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Robinson47" /&gt;

''Caligari'' was released at a time when foreign film industries had just started easing restrictions on the import of German films following World War I.&lt;ref name="Robinson43" /&gt; The film was acquired for American distribution by the [[Goldwyn Pictures|Goldwyn Distributing Company]], and had its American premiere at the [[Capitol Theatre (New York City)|Capitol Theatre]] on 3 April 1921.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kaes|2006|p=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was given a live theatrical prologue and epilogue,&lt;ref name="Budd32" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Robinson47-48"&gt;{{Harvnb|Robinson|1997|pp=47–48}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was not unusual for film premieres at major theatres at the time. In the prologue, the film is introduced by a character called "Cranford", who identifies himself as the man Francis speaks with in the opening scene. In the epilogue, Cranford returns and exclaims that Francis has fully recovered from his madness.&lt;ref name="Robinson47-48" /&gt; Mike Budd believes these additions simplified the film and "adjusted [it] for mass consumption",&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Melnick|2012|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; though Robinson argued it was simply a normal theatrical novelty for the time.&lt;ref name="Robinson48"&gt;{{Harvnb|Robinson|1997|p=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; Capitol Theatre runner Samuel Roxy Rothafel commissioned conductor [[Ernö Rapée]] to compile a musical accompaniment that included portions of songs by composers [[Johann Strauss III]], [[Arnold Schoenberg]], [[Claude Debussy]], [[Igor Stravinsky]] and [[Sergei Prokofiev]]. Rotafel wanted the score to match the dark mood of the film, saying: "The music had, as it were, to be made eligible for citizenship in a nightmare country".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Robinson|1997|p=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Caligari'' had its [[Los Angeles]] premiere at Miller's Theater on 7 May 1921, but the theatre was forced to pull it due to demonstrations by protestors. However, the protest was organized by the Hollywood branch of the [[American Legion]] due to fears of unemployment stemming from the import of German films into America, not over objections to the content of ''Caligari'' itself.&lt;ref name="Robinson51"&gt;{{Harvnb|Robinson|1997|p=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; After running in large commercial theatres, ''Caligari'' began to be shown in smaller theatres and film societies in major cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Budd|1990b|p=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; Box office figures were not regularly published in the 1920s, so it has been difficult to assess the commercial success or failure of ''Caligari'' in the United States. Film historians Kristin Thompson and David B. Pratt separately studied trade publications from the time in an attempt to make a determination, but reached conflicting findings; with Thompson concluding it was a box office success and Pratt concluding it was a failure. However, both agreed it was more commercially successful in major cities than in theatres in smaller communities, where tastes were considered more conservative.&lt;ref name="Robinson50-51"&gt;{{Harvnb|Robinson|1997|pp=50–51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Caligari'' did not immediately receive a wide distribution in France due to fears over the import of German films, but film director [[Louis Delluc]] organized a single screening of it on 14 November 1921, at the Colisée cinema in [[Paris]] as part of a benefit performance for the [[Spanish Red Cross]]. Afterward, the Cosmograph company bought the film's distribution rights and premiered it at the Ciné-Opéra on 2 March 1922.&lt;ref name="Robinson51" /&gt; ''Caligari'' played in one Paris theatre for seven consecutive years, a record that remained intact until the release of ''[[Emmanuelle (film)|Emmanuelle]]'' (1974).&lt;ref name="Peary48" /&gt; According to Janowitz, ''Caligari'' was also shown in such European cities as [[London]], [[Rome]], [[Amsterdam]], [[Stockholm]], [[Brussels]], [[Prague]], [[Vienna]], [[Budapest]] and [[Bucharest]], as well as other countries like [[China]], [[Japan]], [[India]], [[Turkey]] and [[South America]]n nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Janowitz|1941|p=239}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

===Critical response===
[[File:Cabinet of Dr Caligari 1920 Lobby Card.jpg|thumb|right|Goldwyn Releasing lobby card from ''Caligari'' showing doctors examining Cesare]]
There are differing accounts as to how ''Caligari'' was first received by audiences and critics immediately after its release. Stephen Brockmann, Anton Kaes and film theorist [[Kristin Thompson]] say it was popular with both the general public and well-respected by critics.&lt;ref name="Brockmann59" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kaes42"&gt;{{Harvnb|Kaes|2006|p=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Thompson|1990|p=124}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robinson wrote, "The German critics, almost without exception, ranged from favourable to ecstatic".&lt;ref name="Robinson47" /&gt; Kracauer said critics were "unanimous in praising ''Caligari'' as the first work of art on the screen",&lt;ref name="Kracauer71" /&gt; but also said it was "too high-brow to become popular in Germany".&lt;ref name="Kracauer77"&gt;{{Harvnb|Kracauer|1947|p=77}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barlow said it was often the subject of critical disapproval, which he believes is because early film reviewers attempted to assign fixed definitions to the young art of cinema, and thus had trouble accepting the bizarre and unusual elements of ''Caligari''.&lt;ref name="Barlow29" /&gt; Some critics felt it imitated a stage production too closely.&lt;ref name="Kracauer76"/&gt; Other commentators, like critic Herbert Jhering and novelist [[Blaise Cendrars]], objected to the presentation of the story as a madman's delusion because they felt it belittled Expressionism as an artform.&lt;ref name="Robinson33" /&gt; Theatre critic Helmut Grosse condemned the film's visual design as clichéd and derivative, calling it a "cartoon and (a) reproduction of designs rather than from what actually took place on stage".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Patterson|1981|p=106}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several reviewers, like [[Kurt Tucholsky]] and [[Blaise Cendrars]], criticized the use of real actors in front of artificially-painted sets, saying it created an inconsistent level of stylization. Critic Herbert Ihering echoed this point in a 1920 review: "If actors are acting without energy and are playing within landscapes and rooms which are formally 'excessive', the continuity of the principle is missing".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Budd|1990b|pp=36–37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Robinson said the response from American critics was largely positive and enthusiastic,&lt;ref name="Robinson50"&gt;{{Harvnb|Robinson|1997|pp=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kaes said American critics and audiences were divided: some praised its artistic value and others, particularly those distrustful of Germany following World War I, wished to ban it altogether.&lt;ref name="Kaes42" /&gt; Some in the Hollywood film industry felt threatened by the potential rivalry and spoke out against ''Caligari''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s release, condemning it as a "foreign invasion".&lt;ref name="Kaes42" /&gt; Nevertheless, the film remained popular in the United States.&lt;ref name="Barlow29" /&gt; Several American reviewers compared it to an [[Edgar Allan Poe]] story,&lt;ref name="Robinson50" /&gt; including a 1921 review in ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' magazine, which praised the direction and "perfect tempo" of the film, as well as the sets that "squeeze and turn and adjust the eye, and through the eye the mentality".&lt;ref name="Robinson48" /&gt; A ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' review likened it to [[Modern art|modernist art]], comparing the film's sets to [[Marcel Duchamp]]'s ''[[Nude Descending a Staircase, No. 2]]'', and said the film "gives dimensions and meaning to shape, making it an active part of the story, instead of merely the conventional and inert background", which was key to the film's "importance as a work of cinematography".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Screen |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=4 April 1921 |page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Albert Lewin]], a critic who eventually became a film director and screenwriter, called ''Caligari'' "the only serious picture, exhibited in America so far, that in anything like the same degree has the authentic thrills and shock of art".&lt;ref name="Robinson50" /&gt; A story in a November 1921 edition of ''Exceptional Photoplays'', an independent publication issued by the [[National Board of Review|National Board of Review of Motion Pictures]], said it "occupies the position of unique artistic merit", and said American films in comparison looked like they were made for "a group of defective adults at the nine-year-old level".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari |journal=Exceptional Photoplays |publisher=[[National Board of Review|National Board of Review of Motion Pictures]] |issue=10 |date=November 1921 |page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Caligari'' was a critical success in France, but French filmmakers were divided in their opinions after its release. [[Abel Gance]] called it "superb" and wrote, "What a lesson to all directors!"&lt;ref name="Robinson52"&gt;{{Harvnb|Robinson|1997|p=52}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[René Clair]] said  "overthrew the realist dogma" of filmmaking.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Scheunemann|2003a|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Film critic and director [[Louis Delluc]] said the film has a compelling rhythm: "At first slow, deliberately laborious, it attempts to irritate. Then when the zigzag motifs of the fairground start turning, the pace leaps forward, agitato, accelerando, and leaves off only at the word 'End', as abruptly as a slap in the face."&lt;ref name="Eisner17"&gt;{{Harvnb|Eisner|1974|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jean Epstein]], however, called it "a prize example of the abuse of décor in the cinema" and said it "represents a grave sickness of cinema".&lt;ref name="Robinson52" /&gt; Likewise, [[Jean Cocteau]] called it "the first step towards a grave error which consists of flat photography of eccentric decors, instead of obtaining surprise by means of the camera".&lt;ref name="Robinson53"&gt;{{Harvnb|Robinson|1997|p=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;  French critic Frédéric-Philippe Amiguet wrote of the film: "It has the odor of tainted food. It leaves a taste of cinders in the mouth."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Amiguet|1923|p=87}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Russian director [[Sergei Eisenstein]] especially disliked ''Caligari'', calling it a "combination of silent hysteria, partially coloured canvases, daubed flats, painted faces, and the unnatural broken gestures and action of monstrous chimaeras".&lt;ref name="Finler69"&gt;{{Harvnb|Finler|1997|p=69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While early reviews were more divided, modern film critics and historians have largely praised ''Caligari'' as a revolutionary film. Film reviewer [[Roger Ebert]] called it arguably "the first true horror film",&lt;ref name="Ebert" /&gt; and critic [[Danny Peary]] called it cinema's first [[cult film]] and a precursor for [[Art film|arthouse films]].&lt;ref name="Peary48" /&gt; In October 1958, ''Caligari'' was ranked as the twelfth-best film of all time during a poll organized at the [[Expo 58|Brussels World’s Fair]]. With input from 117 film critics, filmmakers and historians from around the world, it was the first universal film poll in history.&lt;ref name="Robinson54"&gt;{{Harvnb|Robinson|1997|p=54}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Thompson|1990|p=121}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Ataide |first=Jesse |title=The Greatest: A First ‘Best’ Chance |publisher=[[Fandor]] |date=3 February 2012 |url=https://www.fandor.com/keyframe/first-and-foremost |accessdate=20 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; American film historian Lewis Jacobs said "its stylized rendition, brooding quality, lack of explanation, and distorted settings were new to the film world".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Jacobs|1939}}&lt;/ref&gt; Film historian and critic [[Paul Rotha]] wrote of it, "For the first time in the history of the cinema, the director has worked ''through'' the camera and broken with realism on the screen; that a film could be effective dramatically when not photographic and finally, of the greatest possible importance, that the mind of the audience was brought into play psychologically".&lt;ref name="Robinson55"&gt;{{Harvnb|Robinson|1997|p=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, Arthur Knight wrote in ''[[Rogue (magazine)|Rogue]]'': "More than any other film, (''Caligari'') convinced artists, critics and audiences that the movie was a medium for artistic expression".&lt;ref name="Peary48" /&gt; ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' included ''Caligari'' in their 1994 "Guide to the Greatest Movies Ever Made", calling it a "landmark silent film" and saying, "No other film's art direction has ever come up with so original a visualization of dementia".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Entertainment Weekly|1997|p=174}}&lt;/ref&gt; It holds a rare [[List of films with a 100% rating on Rotten Tomatoes|100% rating]] on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 48 reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari |publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |year=2015 |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1003361-cabinet_of_dr_caligari/ |accessdate=10 March 2015 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6WvSM9ByG?url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1003361-cabinet_of_dr_caligari |archivedate=10 March 2015 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

===Legacy===
''Caligari'' is considered the quintessential work of German Expressionist cinema, and by far the most famous example of it.&lt;ref name="Barlow29" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Brockmann59" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Scheunemann125"&gt;{{Harvnb|Scheunemann|2003b|p=125}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hirsch54" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Robinson50" /&gt;&lt;ref name="LoBrutto60"&gt;{{Harvnb|LoBrutto|2005|p=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is considered a classic film, often shown in introductory film courses, film societies and museums,&lt;ref name="Budd1" /&gt; and is one of the most famous German films from the silent era.&lt;ref name="Barlow29" /&gt; Film scholar Lewis Jacobs called it "most widely discussed film of the time".&lt;ref name="Kracauer72" /&gt; ''Caligari'' helped draw worldwide attention to the artistic merit of German cinema,&lt;ref name="Finler70" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Brockmann59" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kaes42" /&gt; while also bringing legitimacy to the cinema among literary intellectuals within Germany itself.&lt;ref name="Budd23" /&gt; Lotte Eisner has said it was in Expressionism, as epitomized in ''Caligari'', that "the German cinema found its true nature."&lt;ref name="Brockmann59" /&gt; The term "caligarism" was coined as a result, referring to a style of similar films that focus on such themes as bizarre madness and obsession, particularly through the use of visual distortion.&lt;ref name="Barlow29" /&gt; Expressionism was late in coming to cinema, and by the time ''Caligari'' was released, many German critics felt the art form had become commercialized and trivialized;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kaes|2006|pp=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Scheunemann25"&gt;{{Harvnb|Scheunemann|2003a|pp=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Robinson|1997|p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Budd|1990b|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; such well-known writers as [[Kasimir Edschmid]], [[René Schickele]], and [[Yvan Goll]] had already pronounced the Expressionist movement dead by the time ''Caligari'' arrived in theatres.&lt;ref name="Scheunemann25" /&gt; Few other purely Expressionistic films were produced, and ''Caligari'' was the only one readily accessible for several decades.&lt;ref name="Finler70" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Barlow63"&gt;{{Harvnb|Barlow|1982|p=63}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the few films to fully embrace the Expressionist style were  ''[[Genuine (film)|Genuine]]'' (1920) and ''[[Raskolnikow (film)|Raskolnikow]]'' (1923), both directed by Wiene, as well as ''[[From Morn to Midnight]]'' (1920), ''[[Torgus]]'' (1921), ''[[Das Haus zum Mond]]'' (1921), ''[[Haus ohne Tür und ohne Fenster]]'' (1921) and ''[[Waxworks (film)|Waxworks]]''.&lt;ref name="Robinson53" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Barlow26"&gt;{{Harvnb|Barlow|1982|p=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While few other purely Expressionistic films were made, ''Caligari'' still had a major influence over other German directors,&lt;ref name="Everson4"&gt;{{Harvnb|Everson|1978|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many of the film's Expressionist elements – particularly the use of setting, light and shadow to represent the dark psychology of its characters – became prevalent in German cinema.&lt;ref name="Kracauer77" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Robinson54" /&gt; Among the films to use these elements were Murnau's ''[[Nosferatu]]'' (1922) and ''[[The Last Laugh (1924 film)|The Last Laugh]]'' (1924),&lt;ref name="Peary51" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Brockmann59" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hirsch56"&gt;{{Harvnb|Hirsch|1981|pp=56}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[G. W. Pabst]]'s ''[[Secrets of a Soul]]'' (1926),&lt;ref name="Finler70" /&gt; and Lang's ''[[Metropolis (1927 film)|Metropolis]]'' (1927) and ''[[M (1931 film)|M]]'' (1931).&lt;ref name="Barlow26" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hirsch56" /&gt; The success of ''Caligari'' also affected the way in which German films were produced during the 1920s. For example, the majority of major German films over the next few years moved away from location shooting and were fully filmed in studios,&lt;ref name="Kracauer74" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Robinson54" /&gt; which assigned much more importance to designers in German cinema.&lt;ref name="Robinson54" /&gt; Robinson argues this led to the rise of a large number of film designers – such as [[Hans Dreier]], [[Rochus Gliese]], [[Albin Grau]], [[Otto Hunte]], [[Alfred Junge]], [[Erich Kettelhut]] and [[Paul Leni]] – and that effect was felt abroad as many of these talents later emigrated from Germany with the rise of the Nazi Party.&lt;ref name="Robinson54" /&gt; Additionally, the success of ''Caligari''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s collaborative effort – including its director, set designers and actors – influenced subsequent film production in Germany for many years, making teamwork a hallmark of German cinema in the Weimar Republic.&lt;ref name="Barlow34" /&gt;

The effect of ''Caligari'' was felt not just in German cinema, but internationally as well.&lt;ref name="LoBrutto60" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Barlow63" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Scheunemann|2003a|pp=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Rotha and film historian [[William K. Everson]] wrote that the film probably had as much of a long-term effect on Hollywood directors as ''[[Battleship Potemkin]]'' (1925).&lt;ref name="Everson174"&gt;{{Harvnb|Everson|1978|p=174}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his book ''The Film Til Now'', Rotha wrote that ''Caligari'' and ''Potemkin'' were the "two most momentous advances in the development of the cinema", and said ''Caligari'' "served to attract to the cinema audience many people who had hitherto regarded the film as the low watermark of intelligence".&lt;ref name="Robinson55" /&gt;  ''Caligari'' influenced the style and content of Hollywood films in the 1920s and early 1930s,&lt;ref name="Everson4" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Everson|1978|p=317}}&lt;/ref&gt; particularly in films such as ''[[The Bells (1926 film)|The Bells]]'' (1926), ''[[The Man Who Laughs (1928 film)|The Man Who Laughs]]'' (1928) and ''[[Murders in the Rue Morgue (1932 film)|Murders in the Rue Morgue]]'' (1932),&lt;ref name="Kaes57" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Everson174" /&gt; and had a major influence on American horror films of the 1930s, some of which featured an antagonist using Caligari-like supernatural abilities to control others, such as ''[[Dracula (1931 English-language film)|Dracula]]'' (1931), ''[[Svengali (1931 film)|Svengali]]'' (1931) and ''[[The Mad Genius]]'' (1931).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hantke|2006|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kaes said both ''Caligari''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s stylistic elements, and the Cesare character in particular, influenced the [[Universal Studios]] horror films of the 1930s, which often prominently featured some sort of monster, such as ''[[Frankenstein (1931 film)|Frankenstein]]'' (1931), ''[[The Mummy (1932 film)|The Mummy]]'' (1932), ''[[The Black Cat (1934 film)|The Black Cat]]'' (1934), and ''[[Bride of Frankenstein]]'' (1935).&lt;ref name="Peary51" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kaes57" /&gt; The Expressionism of ''Caligari'' also influenced American [[avant-garde film]], particularly those that used fantastic settings to illustrate an inhuman environment overpowering an individual. Early examples include ''[[The Fall of the House of Usher (1928 American film)|The Fall of the House of Usher]]'' (1928), ''[[The Last Moment]]'' (1928) and ''[[The Life and Death of 9413: a Hollywood Extra]]'' (1928).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Barlow|1982|pp=170–172}}&lt;/ref&gt; LoBrutto wrote, "Few films throughout motion picture history have had more influence on the avant-garde, art, and student cinema than ''Caligari''".&lt;ref name="LoBrutto60" /&gt;

''Caligari'' and German Expressionism heavily influenced the American [[film noir]] period of the 1940s and 50s, both in visual style and narrative tone.&lt;ref name="Kaes42" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Barlow|1982|p=186}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hirsch53"&gt;{{Harvnb|Hirsch|1981|pp=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; Noir films tended to portray everyone, even the innocent, as the object of suspicion, a common thread in ''Caligari''.  The genre also employs several Expressionistic elements in its dark and shadowy visual style, stylized and abstract photography, and distorted and expressive make-up and acting.&lt;ref name="Kaes57" /&gt; ''Caligari'' also influenced films produced in the [[Soviet Union]], such as ''[[Aelita]]'' (1924), and ''[[The Overcoat (1926 film)|The Overcoat]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Eisner|1974|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Observers have noted the black and white films of [[Ingmar Bergman]] bear a resemblance to the German films of the 1920s, and film historian Roy Armes has called him "the true heir of Caligari". Bergman himself, however, has downplayed the influence of German Expressionism on his work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Barlow|1982|p=198}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Caligari'' has also affected stage theatre. Siegfried Kracauer wrote that the film's use of the iris-in has been mimicked in theatrical productions, with lighting used to single out a lone actor.&lt;ref name="Kracauer76" /&gt;

''Caligari'' continues to be one of the most discussed and debated films from the Weimar Republic.&lt;ref name="Brockmann60" /&gt; Two major books have played a large part in shaping the perception of the film and its effect on cinema as a whole: Siegfried Kracauer's ''From Caligari to Hitler'' (1947) and Lotte Eisner's ''The Haunted Screen'' (1974).&lt;ref name="Budd1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Scheunemann125" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Robinson56"&gt;{{Harvnb|Robinson|1997|p=56}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''From Caligari to Hitler'' based its claims about the film largely on an unpublished typescript by Hans Janowitz called ''Caligari: The Story of a Famous Story'',&lt;ref name="Kracauer61" /&gt; which gave Janowitz and Carl Mayer principal credit for the making of ''Caligari''.&lt;ref name="Janowitz222" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Budd|1990a|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Robinson|1997|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mike Budd wrote of Kracauer's book: "Perhaps no film or period has been so thoroughly understood through a particular interpretation as has ''Caligari'', and Weimar cinema generally, through Kracauer's social-psychological approach".&lt;ref name="Budd2"&gt;{{Harvnb|Budd|1990a|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the publication of ''From Caligari to Hitler'', few critics had derived any symbolic political meaning from the film, but Kracauer’s argument that it symbolized German obedience toward authority and a premonition of the rise of Adolf Hitler (see the [[The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari#Authority and conformity|Themes section]] for more) drastically changed attitudes about ''Caligari''. Many of his interpretations of the film are still embraced,&lt;ref name="Scheunemann126" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Robinson32" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Robinson56" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Budd2" /&gt; even by those who have strongly disagreed with his general premise,&lt;ref name="Scheunemann126" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Budd2" /&gt; and even as certain claims Kracauer made have been disproven, such as his statement that the original script included no frame story.&lt;ref name="Robinson56" /&gt; (See [[The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari#Writing|Writing]] for more.) Eisner's book placed ''Caligari'' into historical context by identifying how it influenced Expressionist features in other films of the 1920s.&lt;ref name="Scheunemann125" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Robinson56" /&gt;

Film historian David Robinson claimed Wiene, despite being the director of ''Caligari'', is often given the least amount of credit for its production.&lt;ref name="Robinson24" /&gt; He believes this is in part because Wiene died in 1938, closer to the release of the film than any other major collaborators, and was therefore unable to defend his involvement in the work while others took credit.&lt;ref name="Robinson7" /&gt; In fact, Robinson argues ''Caligari'' ultimately hurt Wiene's reputation because his subsequent films did not match its success, so he is often wrongly considered "a one-film director who had a lucky fluke with Caligari".&lt;ref name="Robinson24" /&gt;

==Themes and interpretations==

===Authority and conformity===
''Caligari'', like a number of [[Weimar culture|Weimar films]] that followed it, thematizes brutal and irrational authority by making a violent and possibly insane authority figure its antagonist.&lt;ref name="Brockmann64" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Budd1"&gt;{{Harvnb|Budd|1990a|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kracauer said Dr. Caligari was symbolic of the German war government and fatal tendencies inherent in the German system, saying the character "stands for an unlimited authority that idolizes power as such, and, to satisfy its lust for domination, ruthlessly violates all human rights and values".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kracauer|1947|pp=64–65}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, John D. Barlow described Dr. Caligari as an example of the tyrannical power and authority that had long plagued Germany, while Cesare represents the "common man of unconditional obedience".&lt;ref name="Barlow32" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Brockmann66"&gt;{{Harvnb|Brockmann|2010|p=66}}&lt;/ref&gt; Janowitz has claimed Cesare represents the common citizen who is conditioned to kill or be killed, just as soldiers are trained during their military service, and that Dr. Caligari is symbolic of the German government sending those soldiers off to die in the war.&lt;ref name="Kracauer65" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Janowitz|1941|pp=224–225}}&lt;/ref&gt; The control Dr. Caligari yields over the minds and actions of others results in chaos and both moral and social perversion.&lt;ref name="Hirsch54-56"&gt;{{Harvnb|Hirsch|1981|pp=54–56}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cesare lacks any individuality and is simply a tool of his master; Barlow writes that he is so dependent on Caligari that he falls dead when he strays too far from the source of his sustenance, "like a machine that has run out of fuel".&lt;ref name="Barlow43"&gt;{{Harvnb|Barlow|1982|p=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his influential book ''From Caligari to Hitler'', Kracauer argues the Dr. Caligari character is symptomatic of a subconscious need in German society for a tyrant, which he calls the German "collective soul".&lt;ref name="Budd28" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hirsch54-56" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Brockmann59"&gt;{{Harvnb|Brockmann|2010|p=59}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kracauer argues Dr. Caligari and Cesare are premonitions of [[Adolf Hitler]] and his rule over Germany, and that his control over the weak-willed, puppet-like somnambulist prefigures aspects of the mentality that allowed the [[Nazi Party]] to rise.&lt;ref name="Peary51" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hirsch54-56" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Brockmann59" /&gt; He calls Dr. Caligari's use of hypnotism to impose his will foreshadowing of Hitler's "manipulation of the soul".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kracauer|1947|pp=72–73}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kracauer described the film as an example of Germany's obedience to authority and failure or unwillingness to rebel against deranged authority,&lt;ref name="Brockmann65-66"&gt;{{Harvnb|Brockmann|2010|pp=65–66}}&lt;/ref&gt; and reflects a "general retreat" into a shell that occurred in post-war Germany.&lt;ref name="Scheunemann125"/&gt; Cesare symbolizes those who have no mind of their own and must follow the paths of others;&lt;ref name="LoBrutto63" /&gt; Kracauer wrote he foreshadows a German future in which "self-appointed Caligaris hypnotized innumerable Cesares into murder".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kracauer|1947|p=272}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barlow rejects Kracauer's claims that the film glorifies authority "just because it has not made a preachy statement against it", and said the connection between Dr. Caligari and Hitler lies in the mood the film conveys, not an endorsement of such tyrant on the film's part.&lt;ref name="Barlow51"&gt;{{Harvnb|Barlow|1982|p=51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Everyday reality in ''Caligari'' is dominated by tyrannical aspects. Authorities sit atop high perches above the people they deal with and hold offices out of sight at the end of long, forbidding stairways.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Barlow|1982|p=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the film's characters are caricatures who fit neatly into prescribed social roles, such as the outraged citizens chasing a public enemy, the authoritarian police who are deferential to their superiors, the oft-harassed bureaucratic town clerk, and the asylum attendants who act like stereotypical "little men in white suits".&lt;ref name="Barlow43" /&gt; Only Dr. Caligari and Cesare are atypical of social roles,  instead serving as, in Barlow's words, "abstractions of social fears, the incarnations of demonic forces of a nightmarish world the bourgeoisie was afraid to acknowledge, where self-assertion is pushed to willful and arbitrary power over others".&lt;ref name="Barlow43-45"&gt;{{Harvnb|Barlow|1982|pp=43–45}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kracauer wrote the film demonstrates a contrast between the rigid control, represented by such characters as Dr. Caligari and the town clerk, and chaos, represented by the crowds of people at the fair and the seemingly never-ending spinning of the merry-go-rounds. He said the film leaves no room for middle ground between these two extremes, and that viewers are forced to embrace either insanity or authoritarian rigidity, leaving little space for human freedom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kracauer|1947|pp=73–74}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Brockmann|2010|p=67}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kracauer writes: "''Caligari'' exposes the soul wavering between tyranny and chaos, and facing a desperate situation: any escape from tyranny seems to throw it into a state of utter confusion".&lt;ref name="Kracauer74"&gt;{{Harvnb|Kracauer|1947|p=74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. Caligari is not the only symbol of arrogant authority in the film. In fact, he is a victim of harsh authority himself during the scene with the dismissive town clerk, who brushes him off and ignores him to focus on his paperwork.&lt;ref name="Brockmann64" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Elsaesser63" /&gt; Film historian [[Thomas Elsaesser]] argues that Dr. Caligari's murderous rampage through Cesare can be seen as a rebellious, anti-authoritarian streak in response to such experiences as these, even in spite of his own authoritarianism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Elsaesser|2003|pp=63–64}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Expressionistic set design in this scene further amplifies the power of the official and the weakness of his supplicant; the clerk towers in an excessively high chair over the small and humiliated Dr. Caligari.&lt;ref name="Brockmann64" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kracauer72"&gt;{{Harvnb|Kracauer|1947|p=72}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scene represents class and status differences, and conveys the psychological experience of being simultaneously outraged and powerless in the face of a petty bureaucracy.&lt;ref name="Elsaesser63"&gt;{{Harvnb|Elsaesser|2003|p=63}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another common visual motif is the use of stairways to illustrate the hierarchy of authority figures, such as the multiple stairs leading up to police headquarters, and three staircases ascending to Dr. Caligari in the asylum.&lt;ref name="Kracauer72" /&gt;

Francis expresses a resentment of all forms of authority, particularly during the end of the frame story, when he feels he has been institutionalized because of the madness of the authorities, not because there is anything wrong with him.&lt;ref name="Barlow50-51"&gt;{{Harvnb|Barlow|1982|pp=50–51}}&lt;/ref&gt; Francis can be seen, at least within the main narrative, as a symbol of reason and enlightenment triumphing over the irrational tyrant and unmasking the absurdity of social authority.&lt;ref name="Barlow32" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Eisner18" /&gt; But Kracauer contended the frame story undermines that premise. He argues if not for the frame story, the tale of Francis's efforts against Dr. Caligari would have been a praiseworthy example of independence and rebellion against authority. However, with the addition of the frame story, which places the veracity of Francis's claims into question, Kracauer argues the film glorifies authority and turns a reactionary story into an authoritarian film:&lt;ref name="Barlow32" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kracauer67" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Peary51" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Brockmann65-66" /&gt; "The result of these modifications was to falsify the action and to ultimately reduce it to the ravings of a madman."&lt;ref name="Robinson32" /&gt; Kracauer believed these changes were not necessarily intentional, but rather an "instinctive submission to the necessities of the screen" because commercial films had to "answer to mass desires".&lt;ref name="Kracauer67" /&gt; Fritz Lang disagreed with Kracaucer's argument, and instead believes the frame story makes the film's revolutionary inclinations more convincing, not less.&lt;ref name="Barlow33" /&gt; David Robinson said, as time passed, filmgoers have been less inclined to interpret the film as a vindication of authority because modern audiences have grown more skeptical of authority in general, and are more inclined to believe Francis's story and interpret the asylum director as wrongly committing Francis to silence him.&lt;ref name="Robinson33"&gt;{{Harvnb|Robinson|1997|p=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Point of view and perception of reality===
Another major theme of ''Caligari'' is, as Stephen Brockmann writes, "the destabilized contrast between insanity and sanity, and hence the destabilization of the very notion of sanity itself".&lt;ref name="Brockmann64" /&gt; By the end of the film, viewers realize the story they have been watching has been told from the perspective of an insane narrator, and therefore they cannot accept anything they have seen as reliable truth. The film's unusual visual abstractions and other stylized elements serve to show the world as one experienced by a madman.&lt;ref name="Brockmann61-62"&gt;{{Harvnb|Brockmann|2010|pp=61–62}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the film has been described as portraying the story as a nightmare and the frame story as the real world.&lt;ref name="LoBrutto62" /&gt; John D. Barlow said the film exemplifies a common Expressionist theme that "the ultimate perception of reality will appear distorted and insane to the healthy and practical mind".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Barlow|1982|p=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film serves as a reminder that any story told through a flashback subjectivizes the story from the perspective of the narrator.&lt;ref name="Kaes54" /&gt; At the end of the film, the asylum director gives no indication that he means Francis ill will, and in fact he seems to truly care for his patients. But Francis nevertheless believes he is being persecuted, so in the story as told from his perspective, Dr. Caligari takes on the role of persecutor.&lt;ref name="Barlow50-51" /&gt;

However, the Expressionistic visual elements of the film are present not only in the main narrative, but also in the epilogue and prologue scenes of the frame story, which are supposed to be an objective account of reality.&lt;ref name="LoBrutto62" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Peary50" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kracauer70" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Brockmann61-62" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Budd|1990b|p=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the frame story scenes still have trees with tentacle-like branches and a high, foreboding wall in the background. Strange leaf and line patterns are seen on the bench Francis sits upon, flame-like geometric designs can be seen on the walls, and his asylum cell has the same distorted shape as in the main narrative.&lt;ref name="Barlow45-46"&gt;{{Harvnb|Barlow|1982|pp=45–46}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the primary story were strictly the delusions of a madman, the frame story would be completely devoid of those elements, but the fact they are present makes it unclear whether that perspective can be taken as reliable either.&lt;ref name="LoBrutto62" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Brockmann62" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Barlow45-46" /&gt; Instead, the film offers no true normal world to oppose to that of the twisted and nightmarish world as described by Francis.&lt;ref name="Hirsch54"&gt;{{Harvnb|Hirsch|1981|p=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, after the film's closing scene, it can be seen as ambiguous whether Francis or the asylum director is truly the insane one, or whether both are insane.&lt;ref name="Brockmann62" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Barlow|1982|pp=52–53}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Budd30"&gt;{{Harvnb|Budd|1990b|p=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, the final shot of the film, with an iris that fades to a close-up on the asylum director's face, further creates doubt over whether the character is actually sane and trustworthy.&lt;ref name="Budd30" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Brockmann|2010|pp=63–64}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Brockmann writes, "In the end, the film is not just about one unfortunate madman; it is about an entire world that is possibly out of balance".&lt;ref name="Brockmann62" /&gt; Mike Budd notes that, during the scene in which asylum doctors restrain Francis, his movements closely mimic those of Dr. Caligari from a similar scene during the main story. Budd says this suggests a "dream logic of repetition" that throws further confusion on which perspective is reality.&lt;ref name="Budd30" /&gt;

===Double life===
Duality is another common theme in ''Caligari''. Dr. Caligari is portrayed in the main narrative as an insane tyrant, and in the frame story as a respected authority and director of a mental institution. As a result of this duality, the viewer cannot help but suspect a malevolent aspect of him at the conclusion of the film, even despite all evidence indicating he is a kind and caring man.&lt;ref name="Barlow49" /&gt; Even within the main narrative alone, Dr. Caligari lives a double life: holding a respectable position as the asylum director, but becoming a hypnotist and murderer at night.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kracauer|1947|p=248}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the character is actually a double of the "real" Caligari, an 18th-century mystic whom the film character becomes so obsessed with that he desires to penetrate his innermost secrets and "become Caligari".&lt;ref name="Kaes52"&gt;{{Harvnb|Kaes|2006|p=52}}&lt;/ref&gt; Francis also takes on a double life of sorts, serving as the heroic protagonist in the main narrative and a patient in a mental institution in the frame story. Anton Kaes described the story Francis tells as an act of transference with his psychiatrist, as well as a projection of his feelings that he is a victim under the spell of the all-powerful asylum director, just as Cesare is the hypnotized victim of Dr. Caligari.&lt;ref name="Kaes52" /&gt; The Cesare character serves as both a persecutor and a victim, as he is both a murderer and the unwilling slave of an oppressive master.&lt;ref name="Barlow49" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Elsaesser63" /&gt;

Siegfried Kracauer said by coupling a fantasy in which Francis overthrows a tyrannical authority, with a reality in which authority triumphs over Francis, ''Caligari'' reflects a double aspect of German life, suggesting they reconsider their traditional belief in authority even as they embrace it.&lt;ref name="Kracauer67" /&gt; A contrast between levels of reality exists not only in the characterizations, but in the presentation of some of the scenes as well.&lt;ref name="Barlow48-49"&gt;{{Harvnb|Barlow|1982|pp=48–49}}&lt;/ref&gt; This, as Barlow writes, "reveals a contrast between external calm and internal chaos".&lt;ref name="Barlow48-49" /&gt; For example, flashback scenes when Francis reads Dr. Caligari's diary, in which the doctor is shown growing obsessed with learning hypnotic powers, take place as Dr. Caligari is sleeping peacefully in the present. Another example is the fair, which on the surface appears to represent fun and escapism, but reveals a lurking sense of chaos and disaster in the form of Dr. Caligari and Cesare.&lt;ref name="Barlow48-49" /&gt; The visual elements of the film also convey a sense of duality, particularly in the contrasts between black and white. This is particularly prevalent in the sets, where black shadows are set against white walls, but also in other elements like the costumes and make-up. For instance, Dr. Caligari wears mostly black, but white streaks are present in his hair and on his gloves. Cesare's face is a ghostly white, but the darks of his eyes are heavily outlined in black. Likewise, Jane's white face contrasts with her deep, dark eyes.&lt;ref name="Barlow49" /&gt;

===Reflection on post-war Germany===
Critics have suggested that ''Caligari'' highlights some of the neuroses prevalent in Germany and the Weimar Republic when the film was made,&lt;ref name="Barlow51" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Brockmann63"&gt;{{Harvnb|Brockmann|2010|p=63}}&lt;/ref&gt; particularly in the shadow of World War I,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Towlson|2014|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; at a time when extremism was rampant, reactionaries still controlled German institutions, and citizens feared the harm the [[Treaty of Versailles]] would have on the economy.&lt;ref name="Barlow51" /&gt; Siegfried Kracauer wrote that the paranoia and fear portrayed in the film were signs of things to come in Germany,&lt;ref name="Kracauer67" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Brockmann63" /&gt; and that the film reflected a tendency in Germans to "retreat into themselves" and away from political engagement following the war.&lt;ref name="Kracauer67" /&gt;&lt;ref name="LoBrutto63" /&gt; Vincent LoBrutto wrote that the film can be seen as a social or political analogy of "the moral and physical breakdown of Germany at the time, with a madman on the loose wreaking havoc on a distorted and off-balanced society, a metaphor for a country in chaos".&lt;ref name="LoBrutto63" /&gt;

Anton Kaes, who called ''Caligari'' "an aggressive statement about war psychiatry, murder and deception", wrote that Alan's question to Cesare, "How long have I to live?" reflected the trauma German citizens experienced during the war, as that question was often on the minds of soldiers and of family members back home concerned about their loved ones in the military. Francis's despair after Alan's murder can likewise be compared to that of the many soldiers who survived the war but saw their friends die on the battlefield. Kaes noted other parallels between the film and war experiences, noting that Cesare attacked Alan at dawn, a common time for attacks during the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kaes|2006|pp=52–53}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas Elsaesser called Caligari an "outstanding example of how "fantastic" representations in German films from the early 1920s seem to bear the imprint of pressures from external events, to which they refer only through the violence with which they disguise and disfigure them."&lt;ref name="Elsaesser63" /&gt;

==Sequels, remakes and musical works==

===Film===
Several unsuccessful attempts were made to produce sequels and remakes in the decades following ''Caligari''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s release. Robert Wiene bought the rights to ''Caligari'' from [[Universum Film AG]] in 1934 with the intention of filming a sound remake, which never materialized before Wiene's death in 1938. He intended to cast [[Jean Cocteau]] as Cesare, and a script, believed to be written by Wiene, indicated the Expressionist style would have been replaced with a French [[Surrealism|surrealist]] style.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Robinson|1997|pp=57–58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1944, Erich Pommer and Hans Janowitz each separately attempted to obtain the legal rights to the film, with hopes of a Hollywood remake.&lt;ref name="Budd32" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Robinson58"&gt;{{Harvnb|Robinson|1997|pp=58}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pommer attempted to argue he had a better claim to the rights because the primary value of the original film came not from the writing, but "in the revolutionary way the picture was produced".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Budd|1990b|p=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, both Janowitz and Pommer ran into complications related to the invalidity of Nazi law in the United States, and uncertainty over the legal rights of sound and silent films.&lt;ref name="Budd32" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Robinson58"/&gt; Janowitz wrote a treatment for a remake, and in January 1945 was offered a minimum guarantee of $16,000 against a five-percent royalty for his rights to the original film for a sequel to be directed by Fritz Lang, but the project never came to fruition.&lt;ref name="Robinson58" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Budd33"&gt;{{Harvnb|Budd|1990b|p=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Janowitz planned a sequel called ''Caligari II'', and unsuccessfully attempted to sell the property to a Hollywood producer for $30,000.&lt;ref name="Budd33"/&gt;

Around 1947, Hollywood agent [[Paul Kohner]] and German filmmaker Ernst Matray also planned a ''Caligari'' sequel; Matray and his wife [[Maria Solveg]] wrote a screenplay called ''The Return of Caligari''.&lt;ref name="Budd33" /&gt; That script would have reimagined Dr. Caligari as a former Nazi officer and war criminal, but the film was never produced.&lt;ref name="Robinson58" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Budd33" /&gt;

In 1960, independent Hollywood producer [[Robert Lippert]] acquired the rights to ''Caligari'' from Matray and Universum Film AG for $50,000, and produced a film called ''[[The Cabinet of Caligari]]'', which was released in 1962.&lt;ref name="Budd33" /&gt; Screenwriter [[Robert Bloch]] did not intend to write a ''Caligari'' remake, and in fact the title was forced upon his untitled screenplay by director [[Roger Kay]].&lt;ref name="Newman461"&gt;{{Harvnb|Newman|2011|pp=461}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film had few similarities to the original ''Caligari'' except for its title and a plot twist at the end,&lt;ref name="Robinson58" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9B06EEDC103EE43BBC4E51DFB3668389679EDE|title=The Cabinet of Caligari (1962)|last=Crowther|first=Bosley|authorlink=Bosley Crowther|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=26 May 1962|accessdate=30 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which it is revealed the story was simply the delusion of the protagonist, who believed she was being held captive by a character named Caligari. Instead, he was her psychiatrist, and he cures her at the end of the film.&lt;ref name="Robinson58" /&gt;

A quasi-sequel, called ''[[Dr. Caligari (film)|Dr. Caligari]]'', was released in 1989,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/02/movies/their-bedside-manners-need-work.html?_r=0 |title=Their Bedside Manners Need Work |last=Piepenburg |first=Erik |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=30 May 2013 |accessdate=19 February 2015 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6WS04u5HM?url=http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/02/movies/their-bedside-manners-need-work.html?_r=1&amp; |archivedate=19 February 2015 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; directed by [[Stephen Sayadian]] and starring [[Madeleine Reynal]] as the granddaughter of the original Dr. Caligari, now running an asylum and performing bizarre hormonal experiments on its patients. The sex-driven story ultimately had little in common with the original film.&lt;ref name="Newman461" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Vanderknyff |first=Rick |title=Marketing'Dr. Caligari' Is Out of Cabinet and on Its Way |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=18 March 1990 |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-03-18/entertainment/ca-1145_1_cult-film |accessdate=19 February 2015 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6WRzm2b6f?url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-03-18/entertainment/ca-1145_1_cult-film |archivedate=19 February 2015 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, theatre director [[Peter Sellars]] released his only feature film, ''[[The Cabinet of Dr. Ramirez]]'', an experimental film loosely based on ''Caligari''. However, the storyline was created as the film was being made, so it has few similarities with the original film.&lt;ref name="Sundance"&gt;{{cite news |title=The Cabinet of Dr. Ramirez |publisher=[[Sundance Institute]] |year=1992 |url=http://history.sundance.org/films/467/the_cabinet_of_dr_ramirez |accessdate=10 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Catalano |first=Peter |title=Sellars' First Reel : The Director Shoots a Silent Movie With Baryshnikov and Cusack.

In 1999 [[Joseph Kahn]] and [[Rob Zombie]] directed a music video for the single "[[Living Dead Girl (song)|Living Dead Girl]]" with imagery directly inspired by ''The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari''.

An [[The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (2005 film)|independent film remake]] of ''Caligari'' edited, written and directed by David Lee Fisher was released in 2005, in which new actors were placed in front of the actual backdrops from the original film. The actors performed in front of a [[Chroma key|green screen]], then their performances were superimposed in front of [[Matte (filmmaking)|matte]] shots based on the original sets. [[Doug Jones (actor)|Doug Jones]] played the role of Cesare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Genzlinger |first=Neil |title=The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (2006) |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=25 October 2006 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/25/movies/25cali.html |accessdate=10 March 2015 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6WvPNozxt?url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/25/movies/25cali.html?_r=0 |archivedate=10 March 2015 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Leydon |first=Joe |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=24 October 2006 |url=https://variety.com/2006/film/reviews/the-cabinet-of-dr-caligari-2-1200512408/ |title=Review: 'The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari' |accessdate=10 March 2015 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6WvPWC8bR?url=http://variety.com/2006/film/reviews/the-cabinet-of-dr-caligari-2-1200512408/ |archivedate=10 March 2015 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Collura |first=Scott |title=Exclusive: Caligari awakens again |publisher=[[IGN]] |date=25 October 2006 |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2006/10/25/exclusive-caligari-awakens-again |accessdate=10 March 2015 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6WvPgL3Jn?url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2006/10/25/exclusive-caligari-awakens-again |archivedate=10 March 2015 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music===
In 1981, [[Bill Nelson (musician)|Bill Nelson]] was asked by the Yorkshire Actors Company to create a soundtrack for a stage adaptation of the film. That music was later recorded for his 1982 album ''Das Kabinet (The Cabinet Of Doctor Caligari)''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Prown|1997|pp=87}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Caligari'' was adapted into an opera in 1997 by composer [[John Moran (composer)|John Moran]]. It premiered at the [[American Repertory Theater]] in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], in a production by Robert McGrath.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[American Repertory Theater]] |year=1997 |title=The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari |url=http://www.americanrepertorytheater.org/events/show/cabinet-dr-caligari |accessdate=10 March 2015 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6WvOh8Ros?url=http://americanrepertorytheater.org/events/show/cabinet-dr-caligari |archivedate=10 March 2015 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The show premiered in February 2015 in Delhi.

2016 saw the production of another operatic version of Dr. Caligari composed by Karen MacIver for [[Scottish Opera]]'s Connect Company with a libretto provided by Allan Dunn. This opera has the action set in [[Glasgow]] 1898. The first performances under the direction of Julie Brown took place on the 9th and 10 April 2016 in Glasgow's Woodside Halls featured the Scottish Opera Connect Orchestra and Chorus conducted by Chris Gray. Alumni from Scottish Opera's Emerging Artists Programme - Andrew McTaggart (Baritone) and Sarah Power (Soprano) - were cast as Dr. Caligari/Dr. Gallacher and Jane respectively alongside Daniel Keating Roberts (Counter-tenor) as Cesare and Glen Cunningham (Tenor) as Francis with members of the Chorus providing additional roles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.scottishopera.org.uk/sites/default/files/images/The%20Cabinet%20of%20Dr%20Caligari%20press%20release%20PDF.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-09-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160617105308/https://www.scottishopera.org.uk/sites/default/files/images/The%20Cabinet%20of%20Dr%20Caligari%20press%20release%20PDF.pdf |archivedate=2016-06-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other===
From 1992 to 1994, a 3-issue comic book mini-series entitled ''Caligari 2050'' written by Rafael Nieves and illustrated by Ken Holewczynski was published by Caliber Entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.caliber-entertainment.com/caligari-2050.html|title=Caligari 2050|last=|first=|date=|website=Caliber Entertainment|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=November 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this futuristic take on the classic film, a mysterious somnambulist killer named Caesar is stalking and killing one by one the corrupt members of a power cabal in New City, a so-called "perfect" city of the future, who have created population mind control. This mini-series was later released complete in graphic-novel format as ''Caligari 2050: Another Sleepless Night''.

In 1998, an audio adaptation of the film written and directed by [[Yuri Rasovsky]] was released by Dove Audio on audio cassette.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.audiofilemagazine.com/reviews/read/908/the-cabinet-of-dr-caligari-by-yuri-rasovsky/|title=The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari|last=Rasovsky|first=Yuri|date=|work=[[AudioFile (magazine)|AudioFile]]|access-date=November 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; With a cast including [[John de Lancie]] as "Franz"/"Francis", [[Tony Jay]] as Caligari, Kaitlin Hopkins as "Anna"/"Jane" and Robertson Dean as "Karl"/"Alan", this dramatization won the [[Independent Publisher Book Awards|Independent Publishers Award]] for Best Direct-to-Audio Production in 1998. An audio CD of this production was released by [[Blackstone Audio]] in 2013.

In 2008, [[BBC Radio 3]] broadcast an audio adaptation by Amanda Dalton entitled ''Caligari'', starring Tom Ferguson as "Franzis", [[Luke Treadaway]] as "Allan", Sarah McDonald Hughes as "Jane", [[countertenor]] [[Robin Blaze]] as "Cesare" and Terence Mann as "The Town Clerk" (doubling as the voice of "The Director" of the mental asylum, Caligari being an entirely silent character in this production).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00f4rdf|title=Drama on 3, Caligari|last=|first=|date=|website=[[BBC Radio 3]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=November 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/writersroom/scripts/caligari|title=Caligari - Amanda Dalton|last=|first=|date=|website=BBC Radio 3|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=November 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 Delhi-based theatre director and scenographer [[Deepan Sivaraman]] directed a play inspired by the film by the same name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Nath|first1=Dipanita|title=Real life is his calling|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/lifestyle/art-and-culture/director-deepan-sivaraman-on-theatre/|accessdate=17 June 2017|publisher=The Indian Express Group|date=21 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The play has been performed by Performance Studies Collective group from Delhi and is a contemporary take on the 1920 film, emerging out of spatial experimentation with a focus on objects, some found and others made. The play was later premiered at the [[Bharat Rang Mahotsav|Bhrat Rang Mahotsav]] in 2016 and later went on to win the META Award in the same year. South Indian premiere was in 2017 at the [[International Theatre Festival of Kerala|International Theater Festival of Kerala]]. It is a multimedia performance in which the scenography and dramaturgy emerge together in an attempt to navigate through the run-down warehouse space where the production has been staged.

The '''Théâtre de Neuve''' was a theatre in [[Geneva]], Switzerland.

In 1783, the original theatre was replaced with a new stone building, the '''Théâtre de Neuve''', designed by [[Pierre-David Matthey]], with three tiers of boxes surrounding the orchestra seats and an audience capacity of 1000. Nevertheless, Its stage was cramped, with very little room in the wings, and the [[orchestra pit]] could not seat more than 30 musicians.
At the eve of the French Revolution, as waves of political unrest rocked Geneva, the new theatre's function was still to entertain foreign officers sent as reinforcements and seats were primarily reserved for sponsors and shareholders. As such, most of the Geneva population could not attend performances.

The Théâtre de Neuve was destined to stand in place for less than a hundred years. Revolutionary troubles forced the theatre to close several times and it was used consecutively as a revolutionary club and a cotton mill. In October 1797, the theatre was definitely closed to any kind of performance, by decision of the authorities.

It remained closed until the French annexed Geneva in April 1798. During this fifteen-year occupation, the theatre hosted several companies of French performers. When Geneva's independence was restored in 1813, the French troops left Geneva, and the actors followed them. The theatre reopened in 1817 and expanded its audiences and repertoire, including works by contemporary composers such as [[Rossini]], [[Donizetti]], Auber and Meyerbeer, [[Beethoven]], Weber and even [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]], whose ''[[Tannhäuser (opera)|Tannhäuser]]'' was heard in Geneva long before it was ever performed in Paris. Despite occasional performances by stars of the time, the quality of performance was usually below average, a mix of [[comedy]], [[vaudeville]], [[operetta]] and, occasionally, a more ambitious opera. The general trend was partial to the French repertoire, preferably light: ''[[Faust (opera)|Faust]]'' was a regular hit, but nowhere near ''[[La fille de Madame Angot]]'' in popularity.

'''Tò he''' (''toy figurine'') is a traditional toy for children in [[Vietnam]] which is made from glutinous [[rice powder]] in form of edible figurine such as animals, flowers or characters in folk stories.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vanishingsaigon.com/2010/05 /to-he/ ]&lt;/ref&gt; In the past, ''tò he'' was made and sold only on the occasion of festivals, especially the [[Tết]] and the [[Mid-Autumn Festival|Trung Thu]] which are the favorite festivals of Vietnamese children. Nowadays, the toy is introduced in almost all traditional festivals and in public places like parks or gardens. As tò he is one of the rare surviving traditional toys of Vietnam, the art of tò he making is considered a cultural ambassador of Vietnam and there are many efforts in order to preserve and develop this traditional art.

==Making==
To create a ''tò he'' figurine, the craftsman needs a mixture of glutinous and ordinary [[rice powder]]s which is easily to knead into different shapes and edible for children, [[bamboo]] sticks to plant the shaped tò he and his own skill in graphic depicting.&lt;ref name=Lecourrier&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lecourrier.vnagency.com.vn/default.asp?xt=xt33&amp;page=newsdetail&amp;newsid=53359 |title=  Millénaire de Thang Long : la vitalité des tò he de Xuân La |date=2009-06-17 |publisher=''Le Courrier du Vietnam |language=French |author=My Anh}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modeled by the hand of the craftsmen, the forms of tò he figurine are drawn from animals, flowers and characters in folk stories such as [[Sun Wukong|Tôn Ngộ Không]], the Monkey King in ''[[Journey to the West]]''. There are seven basic colours of tò he figurines which are green, sea blue, red, purple, yellow, white and black, those colours come from rice powder mixed with [[food dye]]s which are used to replace colours from trees or ashes in order to ensure the edibleness of tò he.&lt;ref name=Vietnamnet0902&gt;{{cite web |url=http://english.vietnamnet.vn/features/2008/09/801689/ |title=The vitality of To he craft village |date=2008-09-02 |publisher=Vietnamnet.vn |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090219120300/http://english.vietnamnet.vn/features/2008/09/801689/ |archivedate=2009-02-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the past, tò he was steamed after being kneaded but today the figurines are made directly from preboiled paste so that the craftsman can reduce the time for making one tò he figurine.&lt;ref name=Kendall&gt;{{cite book |title=Vietnam: journeys of body, mind, and spirit |pages=98&amp;ndash;99 |author=Nguyễn Văn Huy, Laurel Kendall |publisher=University of California Press |year=2003 |isbn=0-520-23872-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The paste is made from glutinous and ordinary rice powders, it was kneaded with fresh water before dropped in boiling water for one hour and finally dyed with food colour.&lt;ref name=ttvh&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thethaovanhoa.vn/285N20080827083648822T0/to-hevan-vung-vang-mot-suc-song.htm |title=Tò he - vẫn vững vàng một sức sống |date=2008-08-27 |publisher=Thethaovanhoa.vn |author=Trung Kiên |language=Vietnamese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The procedure of tò he making requires utmost patience from the craftsman, but almost all tò he makers are men and there is an unwritten law in families of tò he craftsmen that secret in making tò he is only passed from father to sons and daughters-in-law, not to daughters. There are no lesson of tò he making, sons are transmitted the skill from their father solely in watching and self-learning.&lt;ref name=Vietnamnet0902/&gt;&lt;ref name=Vietnamnet0705&gt;{{cite web |url=http://english.vietnamnet.vn/lifestyle/2005/05/422527/ |title=Rare children’s art goes to US, puts Xuan La on map |date=2005-05-07 |publisher=Vietnamnet.vn |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090430125310/http://english.vietnamnet.vn/lifestyle/2005/05/422527/ |archivedate=2009-04-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, nowadays tò he making is also taught to the handicapped so that they can live on making tò he and other forms of traditional art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://english.vietnamnet.vn/features/2008/08/800051/ |title=Centre hands disabled a better future |publisher=Vietnamnet.vn |date=2008-08-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090223002010/http://english.vietnamnet.vn/features/2008/08/800051/ |archivedate=2009-02-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:To he Vietnam.jpg|thumb|left|250px|A tò he craftsman making an animal figurine besides the [[Temple of Literature, Hanoi]].]]
Traditionally, tò he craftsmen had a compact set of tools so that in one day they could go to several common places such as [[Market (place)|markets]], [[Vietnamese communal temple|communal temple ground]]s and especially local festivals where children often gathered to play or accompany their parents. According to the old generation of tò he craftsmen, the origin of tò he making was dated to the 17th century.&lt;ref name=Vietnamnet0902/&gt; The two most important occasions each year for tò he craftsmen are [[Tết]] and [[Mid-Autumn Festival|Trung Thu]] because they are the favorite festivals for Vietnamnese children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://english.vietnamnet.vn/lifestyle/2008/09/803515/ |title=The Traditional Mid Autumn Festival |date=2008-09-13 |publisher=Vietnamnet.vn |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090103093658/http://english.vietnamnet.vn/lifestyle/2008/09/803515/ |archivedate=2009-01-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nowadays, tò he is made and sold not only during the [[Tết]] holiday and other festivals but also all year round in public place like [[park]]s, [[garden]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://english.vietnamnet.vn/lifestyle/2009/01/822125/ |title=Hanoi to have lantern festival for Tet |publisher=Vietnamnet.vn |date=2009-01-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091005020456/http://english.vietnamnet.vn/lifestyle/2009/01/822125/ |archivedate=2009-10-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://english.vietnamnet.vn/lifestyle/2009/02/826677/ |title=Buying luck at Vieng Market |publisher=Vietnamnet.vn |date=2009-02-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090501145745/http://english.vietnamnet.vn/lifestyle/2009/02/826677/ |archivedate=2009-05-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The price for a figurine sold in [[Hanoi]] varies from 3,000 to 5,000 [[VND]].&lt;ref name=Vietnamnet0902/&gt;&lt;ref name=ttvh/&gt; There is a village in the countryside of Hanoi where many people earn their living by making and selling tò he, it is Xuân La village which has about 200 tò he craftsmen and almost all villagers from children to adults can make tò he figurine in a very brief period.&lt;ref name=Lecourrier/&gt; Facing the threat from modern toys and other forms of entertainment,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vietnamnews.vnagency.com.vn/showarticle.php?num=01SUN041009 |title=Festivals may be toymakers’ swansong |date=2009-10-04 |publisher=[[Vietnam News Agency]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; tò he craftsmen have to be more and more creative so that their figurines can appear more lively and closer to the children,&lt;ref name=Vietnamnet0902/&gt; for that reason tò he figurines today can be also modeled after characters from international films and cartoons such as [[Doraemon]], [[Pikachu]] and even [[Sailor Moon (character)|Sailor Moon]] with her very own blond hair.&lt;ref name=Kendall/&gt;
 
As one of the rare surviving traditional toys in modern time, tò he is considered a cultural ambassador of Vietnam. Some craftsmen are invited to the [[United States]] or [[South Korea]] to perform the art of tò he making.&lt;ref name=Lecourrier/&gt;&lt;ref name=Vietnamnet0705/&gt; Another positive sign for the existence of tò he is that the Ministry of Culture and Information of Vietnam has paid more attention in preserving and propagating this traditional art.&lt;ref name=Vietnamnet0902/&gt; A tò he craftsman from [[Thái Bình]] was presented with medal from the Vietnam Folk Literature and Art Association for his effort in preserving the art of tò he making&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://english.vietnamnet.vn/lifestyle/2008/12/821078/ |title=Vietnam Folk Literature and Art Awards 2008 presented |date=2008-12-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090104071132/http://english.vietnamnet.vn/lifestyle/2008/12/821078/ |archivedate=2009-01-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; while tò he is frequently introduced in cultural festivals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://english.vietnamnet.vn/lifestyle/2004/11/347011/ |title=Further details for the Vietnam-Japan Festival |date=2004-11-18 |publisher=Vietnamnet.vn |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071010013414/http://english.vietnamnet.vn/lifestyle/2004/11/347011/ |archivedate=2007-10-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://english.vietnamnet.vn/lifestyle/2005/02/376993/ |title=Vietnam to open the first national Ca Tru Festival |date=2005-02-17 |publisher=Vietnamnet.vn |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080527083213/http://english.vietnamnet.vn/lifestyle/2005/02/376993/ |archivedate=2008-05-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://english.vietnamnet.vn/lifestyle/200912/HCM-City-welcomes-the-New-Year-with-festivals-886635/ |title=HCM City welcomes the New Year with festivals |date=2009-12-18 |publisher=Vietnamnet.vn |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100117020942/http://english.vietnamnet.vn/lifestyle/200912/HCM-City-welcomes-the-New-Year-with-festivals-886635/ |archivedate=2010-01-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tò he is brought to the poor children of the mountainous region in the North of Vietnam who cannot afford to buy toys, they are also given instructions to make simple forms of tò he figurines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://english.vietnamnet.vn/social/2008/05/785786/ |title=Poor children in Hoa Binh get toys |date=2008-05-30 |publisher=Vietnamnet.vn |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090503063020/http://english.vietnamnet.vn/social/2008/05/785786/ |archivedate=2009-05-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Warsaw Theatre Directorate''' (''Warszawskie Teatry Rządowe'') was the chief authority for theatres in the [[Duchy of Warsaw]] in [[Warsaw]] during the 19th and early 20th centuries. It was set up by decree of [[Frederick Augustus I of Saxony]] on 14 April 1810 as the ''Rządowa Dyrekcja Teatru'' (Government Directorate for Theatre), its draft statute having been developed by [[Wojciech Bogusławski|Wojciecha Bogusławskiego]]. In 1822 it changed its name to ''Dyrekcja Teatrów i Wszelkich Widowisk Dramatycznych i Muzycznych w Królestwie'' (Directorate of all theatres and dramatic and musical performance in the Kingdom), then in 1833 to the Warsaw Theatre Directorate. It ceased to exist in July 1915.

It guided theatrical output and provided theatres with financial stability, enabling shows in Polish to be put on and new theatre buildings to be constructed. Its companies included ones for operettas, ballets, dramas, comedies, the [[National Theatre, Warsaw|National Theatre]] and later opera and farce.  It had 5 buildings:
* from 1833 - [[Great Theatre, Warsaw|Teatr Wielki]] and the [[Teatr Rozmaitości, Warsaw|Teatr Rozmaitości]]
* from 1870 - [[Teatr Letni, Warsaw|Teatr Letni]]
* from 1880 - [[Teatr Mały, Warsaw (1880-1901)|Teatr Mały]]
* from 1881 - [[Teatr Nowy, Warsaw (1881-1901)|Teatr Nowy]]
* from 1901 - [[Teatr Nowości]]
