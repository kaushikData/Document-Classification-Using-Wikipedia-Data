'''The aestheticization of politics''' was an idea first coined by [[Walter Benjamin]] as being a key ingredient to [[Fascist]] regimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jay|first=Martin|year=1992|title="The Aesthetic Ideology" as Ideology; Or, What Does It Mean to Aestheticize Politics?|journal=Cultural Critique|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|issue=21|jstor=1354116}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this theory, life and the affairs of living are conceived of as innately [[art]]istic, and related to as such politically. [[Politics]] are in turn viewed as artistic, and structured like an [[art form]] which reciprocates the artistic conception of life being seen as art.

This has also been noted as being connected to the [[Italy|Italian]] [[Futurism (art)|Futurist]] movement and postulated as its main motivation for getting involved in the Fascist regime of [[Italy]].

Alternately, "[[politicization of aesthetics]]" (or "politicization of art") has been used as a term for an [[ideology|ideologically]] opposing synthesis, sometimes associated with the [[Soviet Union]], wherein art is ultimately subordinate to political life and thus a result of it, separate from it, but which is attempted to be incorporated for political use as theory relating to the consequential political nature of art. The author [[Emilio Gentile]] has stressed that these two ideas are not mutually exclusive, and both regimes had a large degree of the other. In Benjamin's original formulation, however, the politicization of aesthetics was treated conceptually as the polar opposite of the aestheticization of politics, the former treated as a kind of revolutionary praxis, redeeming force, or "antidote" to the corrupting fascistic influence of the latter.

An '''animateur''' is a [[music]]al professional whose role is to engage audiences with a new or unfamiliar form of music,&lt;ref name="mediamatch" /&gt; "bringing it to life" beyond what might be expected in a traditional performance.

The role of animateur developed from the French concept of "animation socio-culturelle" and first became established in the 1980s as musical outreach activities were being formalised in the UK.&lt;ref name="Higgins2012" /&gt; Because the role has roots in the United Kingdom,&lt;ref name="polyphonic" /&gt; they are most common in the English-speaking world.

While an animateur is likely to have some skill in performance (with voice or instrument), conducting, teaching and possibly composition or arrangement, their principal role is to assist the communication of the performers and the audience. If working with a [[symphony orchestra]], for instance, they might accomplish this through running participatory workshops to introduce audience members to aspects of the music to be performed, or by facilitating dialogue between performers and audience members.

There are animateurs in a wide number of musical styles. While they are probably most common in [[classical music]], they also work in [[jazz]], [[gamelan]] and some forms of African traditional music. Often they are employed by an orchestra, concert hall or music education service, though some also work freelance accepting commissions from groups or organisations for a specific occasion. Animateurs also work with children (where the discipline can approach a form of musical [[youth work]]) as well as adults. Possibly the best known animateur in the United Kingdom is [[Gareth Malone]], who for some years ran the youth and community choirs at the [[London Symphony Orchestra]]'s music education center, [[LSO St Luke's]] prior to applying the same skills in a series of television programmes.

She is the founder of nonprofit cultural foundation "St. Petersburg Arts Project" and "CYLAND" MediaArtLab, and is director of "Frants Gallery" ([[New York City|New York]], [[United States]]).

== Biography ==
In 1989, Frants graduated from the [[Saint Petersburg Art and Industry Academy|St. Petersburg Stieglitz State Academy of Art and Design]] (formerly the Vera Mukhina Leningrad Higher School of Art and Industry), where she had majored in [[Industrial Design]]. In 1992, she was admitted to the New-York [[Pratt Institute]] to the department of Art and Design where she majored in [[Computer Graphics]] and [[Animation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncca.ru/events.text?filial=6&amp;id=3946 Лекция Анны Франц «Дизайн против Искусства против Дизайна»] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180407184129/http://www.ncca.ru/events.text?filial=6&amp;id=3946 |date=2018-04-07 }} // [[National Centre for Contemporary Arts]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The mastering of [[computer graphics]] and [[animation]] marked the beginning of her enthusiasm for [[new media]], [[new media art]] and technologies in art&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;[http://digicult.it/it/news/the-time-keeper-a-traveling-group-exhibition-examining-the-presence-of-past-present-and-future/ The Time Keeper.

Digital Art, Design and Culture. 2012.06.12.&lt;/ref&gt; and the concentration of her interests on the transition from traditional classical methods to [[cyberarts]] that was afforded unlimited possibilities by the rapidly developing [[internet]].

In 1997, she married Leonid Frants. Their son Daniil became the youngest artist at CYLAND MediaArtLab: when he was only twelve, he created, as part of Cyfest, an international educational game program for children, the workshop "Humanizing Robots",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/humanizing.robots|title="Humanizing Robots" by Daniil Frants - global workshop on robots for kids|website=www.facebook.com|accessdate=20 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; which he held in [[Russia]], [[Germany]], [[Japan]], [[United States]] and [[Ukraine]].

In addition to continuous exhibition activities as an artist and a curator&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;[http://www.chasedmagazine.com/2015/07/people-interview-with-curator-anna-frants-at-venice-biennal-2015/ People: Interview with curator Anna Frants at Venice Biennial 2015] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180304173629/http://www.chasedmagazine.com/2015/07/people-interview-with-curator-anna-frants-at-venice-biennal-2015/ |date=2018-03-04 }} // Chased. Magazin für Kunst, Ausstellungen, Vernissagen in Berlin. July 12. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; in New York, [[St. Petersburg]], [[Europe]] and [[Japan]], in 2010, Anna traveled to the [[Polar regions of Earth|Polar Region]] as a member of the international group of artists within the program "The Arctic Circle"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.thearcticcircle.org/ |title=The Arctic Circle artist and scientist residency program |access-date=2014-02-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140206201610/http://www.thearcticcircle.org/ |archive-date=2014-02-06 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; organized by the [[Canadian government]]. The program's purpose was to afford the artists an opportunity to visit hard-to-reach places of the [[Polar regions of Earth|Polar Region]] that are mostly known through scientific reports, which would subsequently allow them to create art projects based on their impressions of the region. In addition to the video footage filmed by Anna, that trip resulted in her interactive project Trembling Creatures,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.annafrants.net/home_19.html|title=::: Anna Frants :::|website=www.annafrants.net|accessdate=20 July 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170929000534/http://www.annafrants.net/home_19.html|archive-date=29 September 2017|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; exhibited at the group show of participants of those annual expeditions that opened in May 2014 at the "1285 Avenue of the Americas Art Gallery"&lt;ref&gt;[http://dutchcultureusa.com/blog/1631/paul-segers-and-arjen-de-leeuw-in-magnetic-north-artists-and-the-arctic-circle Paul Segers and Arjen de Leeuw in 'Magnetic North Artists and The Arctic Circle'] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171018190505/http://dutchcultureusa.com/blog/1631/paul-segers-and-arjen-de-leeuw-in-magnetic-north-artists-and-the-arctic-circle |date=2017-10-18 }} // Dutch Culture USA. 16 May 2014, by Stefanie Hofman.&lt;/ref&gt; in New York.

In the documentary of [[Andrei Zagdansky|Andrey Zagdansky]] "Konstantin and Mouse", dedicated to [[Konstantyn K. Kuzminsky|Konstantin Kuzminsky]], one of the episodes was filmed at the opening night of "Art around the Barracks" at Frants Gallery in [[Soho]].

{{Cquote
|text=''The use of computers allows the artist to break away from the deterministic nature of traditional art forms... Computer art is often similar to conceptual art from the point of view of intellectual judgment: the viewer needs to understand the artist's intentions. This understanding is even more important in interactive projects because the way we react depends on our ability to understand the artist's idea and expectations. The cyberart is challenging because it is based on the technologies and the means that are less intuitive for us and new in their form... Each innovative work gives us a new perspective for understanding the infinitely expanding universe of art and teaches us to understand its creative glossary.''

Gradually, the scope of activities of "Frants Gallery Space" expanded and started including not just the traditional genres, such as painting, sculpture and graphics, but also the art associated with the latest technologies:&lt;ref name="artpropaganda.com"/&gt; cyberart, video art, computer animation, interactive installations as well as performance art.

The collection's creation was a natural extension of the development of "St. Petersburg Arts Project". Since 1998, Anna and Leonid Frants have been collecting works of visual arts of Leningrad underground.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; Their current collection also includes sculptures, assemblages, photographs, videos, objects of actual art and archival materials.

In January 2013, the Department of Contemporary Art at the [[Hermitage Museum]] organized, as a part of the project "Actual Art of St. Petersburg, A Retrospective",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://archive.is/wSlne|title=Простые правила В рамках образовательной программы "РЕТРОСПЕКТИВА.

The '''Apollo Barberini''' is a 1st–2nd-century Roman sculpture of [[Apollo Citharoedus]].  It is a probable copy of the sculpture of [[Apollo Citharoedus]] (possibly by [[Scopas]] and perhaps from the sanctuary of Apollo at [[Rhamnus (Greek archaeological site)|Rhamnus]], in Attica) that was the cult statue in the [[temple of Apollo Palatinus]] in [[Rome]].  

It is named after the [[Barberini]] who acquired it.  It is now held in the [[Glyptothek|Munich Glyptothek]] (Inv. 211).

[[File:Reliquary Thomas Becket MNMA Cl23296.jpg|thumb|A simpler, slightly later chasse showing scenes of Beckett's life.]]

The '''Becket Casket''' is a [[reliquary]] in [[Limoges enamel]] now in the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]].  It is made of [[gilding|gilt-copper]] round a wooden core, decorated with [[champlevé]] [[Vitreous enamel|enamel]], and of a shape called a "[[chasse (casket)|chasse]]".  It was made in about 1180–90 in [[Limoges]], France, and depicts one of the most infamous events in [[England|English]] history. On the night of 29 December 1170, [[Archbishop]] [[Thomas Becket]] was murdered in [[Canterbury cathedral]] by four knights obeying the wishes of [[Henry II of England|King Henry II]]. It provoked outrage throughout [[Europe]], and pilgrims flocked to Canterbury to pray at the site of the murder. In 1173 Becket was [[saint|canonized]] and his shrine was one of the most famous in the Christian world, until its total destruction in 1538 during the reign of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]].  It is thought that this particular casket was made to hold the relics of Thomas Becket that were taken to Peterborough Abbey (now [[Peterborough Cathedral]]) by Abbot Benedict in 1177.  Benedict had been Prior at Canterbury Cathedral and therefore saw Becket's assassination. 

[[Relic]]s of St Thomas were widely dispersed in the years following his death. Many were placed in [[casket]]s made in [[Limoges enamel]] in south-west [[France]]. This was the centre for the production of objects in champlevé enamel, which is characterized by brilliant blues, colourful rosettes and boldly engraved figures. This casket is the most elaborate, the largest and possibly the earliest in date, but over 45 medieval chasses survive showing Becket's story and thought to have been made in Limoges.  Another fine example is in the [[Burrell Collection]] in [[Glasgow]].&lt;ref&gt;Binski, 225, with a catalogue entry on the Burrell chasse.&lt;/ref&gt;   

The scene of the [[martyr]]dom is shown on the front, where one of the knights decapitates Becket in front of the [[altar]], while on the sloping roof the archbishop's funeral is depicted. On the back are four saints and at the one end [[Jesus Christ|Christ]] is seated on a rainbow. The other end, which may have shown [[St Peter]], is missing, as is the floor of the casket and its contents.

The '''Byzantine Revival''' (also referred to as '''Neo-Byzantine''') was an [[Revivalism (architecture)|architectural revival]] movement, most frequently seen in religious, institutional and public [[building]]s. It incorporates elements of the [[Byzantine style]] associated with [[Eastern Christian|Eastern]] and [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christian]] architecture dating from the 5th through 11th centuries, notably that of [[Constantinople]] (present-day [[Istanbul]]) and the [[Exarchate of Ravenna]].
Neo-Byzantine architecture emerged in the 1840s in [[Western Europe]] and peaked in the last quarter of the 19th century in the [[Russian Empire]], and later [[Bulgaria]]. Neo-Byzantine school was active in [[Yugoslavia]] between [[World War I]] and [[World War II]].

==German countries==
[[Image:Favoriten (Wien) - Christuskirche (1).JPG|thumb|right|Christuskirche in [[Matzleinsdorf Protestant Cemetery]], Vienna 1858—1860]]
Earliest examples of emerging Byzantine-[[Romanesque architecture]] include the [[Alexander Nevsky Memorial Church]], Potsdam, by Russian architect [[Vasily Stasov]], and the [[St. Boniface's Abbey, Munich|Abbey of Saint Boniface]], laid down by [[Ludwig I of Bavaria]] in 1835 and completed in 1840. The basilica followed the rules of 6th-century [[Ravenna]] architecture, although its [[corinthian order]] was a clear deviation from the historical Byzantine art. In 1876 [[Ludwig II of Bavaria]] commissioned Neo-Byzantine interiors of the externally Romanesque [[Neuschwanstein Castle]], complete with mosaic images of [[Justinian I]] and Greek saints.

Danish architect [[Theophil Hansen]] became a supporter of the style in the 1850s. His major works belonged to [[Neo-Grec]] style, however, Hansen as a professor of Byzantine art in [[University of Vienna]] shaped a generation of architects that popularized Neo-Byzantine architecture in [[Austro-Hungary]], [[Serbia]] and post-war [[Yugoslavia]]. Hansen's own Neo-Byzantine work include the [[Holy Trinity Greek Orthodox Church, Vienna]] (1856—1858) and the Christuskirche in [[Matzleindorf]] (1858—1860).

Several Neo-Byzantine-style churches were constructed during the [[Gründerzeit]], for instance, the [[Sacred Heart Church (Berlin)|Sacred Heart Church]] or the [[Rosary Basilica (Berlin)|Rosary Basilica]], both located in [[Berlin]].

==Russian Empire==

{{main|Neo-Byzantine architecture in the Russian Empire}}

[[Sophia Cathedral]] in [[Pushkin (town)|Pushkin]] (1782—1788) was the earliest and isolated experiment with Byzantine treatment of otherwise [[neoclassicism|neoclassical]] structures. In 1830s [[Nicholas I of Russia]] promoted the so-called ''Russo-Byzantine'' style of churches designed by [[Konstantin Thon]]. Nicholas I despised true Byzantine art; Thon's style in fact had little common with it. Notably, Thon routinely replaced the circular Byzantine arch with a [[keel]]-shaped [[gable]], and the hemispherical Byzantine dome with an [[onion dome]]; layout and structural scheme of his churches clearly belonged to neoclassical standard.

True Byzantine art, popularized by [[Grigory Gagarin]] and [[David Grimm (architect)|David Grimm]], was adopted by [[Alexander II of Russia]] as the de facto official style of the Orthodox Church. Byzantine architecture became a vehicle of Orthodox expansion on the frontiers of Empire ([[Congress Poland]], [[Crimea]], the [[Caucasus]]). However, few buildings were completed in the reign of Alexander II due to financial troubles. [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander III]] changed state preference in favor of [[Russian Revival]] trend based on 16th-17th century [[Moscow]] and [[Yaroslavl]] tradition, yet Byzantine architecture remained a common choice, especially for large cathedrals. Neo-Byzantine cathedrals concentrated in the western provinces (Poland, Lithuania), the Army bases in Caucasus and [[Central Asia]], the [[Cossack host]]s and the industrial region in [[Urals]] around the city of [[Perm]]. Architects [[David Grimm (architect)|David Grimm]] and [[Vasily Kosyakov]] developed a unique national type of a single-dome Byzantine cathedral with four symmetrical [[pendentive]] apses that became de facto standard in 1880s-1890s.

The reign of [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]] was notable for the architects's turn from this standard back to [[Hagia Sophia]] legacy, peaking in the [[Naval Cathedral in Kronstadt]] and [[Poti]] cathedral. These designs employed [[reinforced concrete]] that allowed very fast construction schedule; their interiors contained clear references to contemporary [[Art Nouveau]] yet the exteriors were a clear homage to medieval Constantinople. Russian Neo-Byzantine tradition was terminated by the [[Russian revolution of 1917|revolution of 1917]] but was continued by emigrant architects in [[Yugoslavia]] and [[Harbin]].

==United States==

In the United States and elsewhere, the Neo-Byzantine style is often seen in [[Vernacular architecture|vernacular]] amalgamations with other [[Medieval]] revivalist styles such as [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] and [[Gothic revival|Gothic]], or even with the [[Mission Revival Style architecture|Mission Revival]] or [[Spanish Colonial Revival Style architecture|Spanish Colonial Revival]] styles.

Notable [[United States|American]] examples include many buildings on the campus of [[Rice University]] in [[Texas]], and [[Christ Church United Methodist]] in Manhattan by [[Ralph Adams Cram]]; [[Immaculate Conception Church (New Orleans)|Immaculate Conception Church]] in [[New Orleans]], [[St. Francis de Sales Roman Catholic Church (Philadelphia)|St. Francis de Sales Church]] in [[Philadelphia]], [[Cathedral Basilica of St. Louis]] and the [[Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception]] built between 1920 and 1959 in [[Washington, D.C.]]  In the early 1980s, [[Philip Johnson]] designed a [[Post-Modernist]] addition to the [[Cleveland Play House]] that reflects Byzantine influences, and could thus be termed Neo-Byzantine.

==United Kingdom and Ireland==
[[Westminster Cathedral]] (1895–1903), the Catholic cathedral in London, is the largest and most thorough British effort in the style, by [[John Francis Bentley]] (1839–1902), but there are a number of other churches and other buildings such as the [[Christ Church, Brixton Road]], also in London, by [[Arthur Beresford Pite]], 1897–1903, near the [[Oval Cricket Ground]]. From about 1850 to 1880 in [[Bristol]] a related style known as [[Bristol Byzantine]] was popular for industrial buildings which combined elements of the [[Byzantine style]] with [[Moorish architecture]]. [[Newman University Church]], [[Dublin]] (1885–86) is a notable Irish example.

'''''The Seven Books of the Diana''''' (Spanish: ''Los siete libros de la Diana'') is a [[pastoral]] romance written in Spanish by the Portuguese author [[Jorge de Montemayor]].  The romance was first published in 1559, though later editions expanded upon the original text.  A sixteenth-century bestseller, the ''Diana'' helped launch a vogue for stories about shepherds, shepherdesses, and their experiences in love.  One of its most famous readers was [[William Shakespeare]], who seems to have borrowed the Proteus-Julia-Sylvia plot of ''[[The Two Gentlemen of Verona]]'' from Felismena's tale in the ''Diana''.

==Plot==
The ''Diana'' begins with a summary of previous events, telling us that the shepherd Sireno is in love with the shepherdess Diana.  She once returned his love, but when Sireno was called away from their village, she was married to another shepherd named Delio.  The story begins with Sireno's return after a year's absence, having already learned of Diana's marriage.

Over the course of the first three books, Sireno encounters other shepherds and shepherdesses who sing songs and tell stories of their own experiences with frustrated love.  Among these is a warrior maiden named Felismena (not truly a shepherd, but dressed as one for the time being), who rescues Sireno and his friends from an attack by wild men. The group of shepherds is persuaded to seek out the enchantress Felicia, who may have the power to solve their romantic dilemmas.  In the fourth book they are welcomed by Felicia at her castle, and proceed to tour the wonders within (including the halls of Venus and Mars, and a performance by the legendary Orpheus). After they have rested, Felicia administers her magic potion, causing some of the shepherds to either forget or reroute their old desires.  Sireno is cured of his love for Diana. In the final three books the initial love stories are resolved, with the shepherds either finding new love partners or recovering ones they believed they had lost. Felismena finds her lover, Don Felis (or "Felix" in the English translation), and rescues him from an attack by enemy knights. With a little help from Felicia's magic, Felis remembers his love for Felismena and the two are married.  The Sireno-Diana situation, however, remains unresolved. Sireno can now greet Diana with calm indifference, but Diana is clearly pained by his transformation and laments her forced marriage to another man. The book ends by promising a sequel, though Montemayor never lived to complete one.

==Expansions and sequels==
The 1561 edition of Valladolid introduced certain changes into the text which were often reproduced in later editions and translations.  The most significant of these changes is the insertion of a new interpolated tale, the "Abencerraje," told to entertain the shepherds in Felismena's palace at the end of book 4.  Scholars now believe the new material to be Montemayor's own work, though the decision to add them to his pastoral romance may have been made by an enterprising publisher.&lt;ref&gt;Juan Montero, "Prólogo," in ''La Diana'', by Jorge de Montemayor (Barcelona: Crítica, 1996), lxxx-lxxxi, and p. 213 note 245.&lt;/ref&gt;

Montemayor's text prompted two separate sequels in Spanish, both published in 1564: Alonso Pérez's ''La Segunda Parte de la Diana'' (The Second Part of the Diana), and [[Gaspar Gil Polo]]'s ''Diana Enamorada'' (Enamoured Diana).  Bartholomew Yong's English translation of the ''Diana'' (completed ca. 1582 and published in 1598) included both sequels alongside Montemayor's original.&lt;ref&gt;''Diana of George of Montemayor'', trans. Bartholomew Yong (London: Edm. Bollifant, 1598).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Circulation and Influence in the Renaissance==
While inspired by Jacobo Sannazaro's [[Arcadia (poem)|''Arcadia'']], Montemayor's ''Diana'' is arguably the first major work of pastoral prose fiction in the Renaissance, placing just as much emphasis on its ongoing plot and interwoven stories as on the poems sung by its shepherd protagonists.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Alpers, ''What is Pastoral?'' (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1996), 348-360.&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''Diana'' is significant for being one of the most popular works of early modern fiction not merely in Spain, but abroad as well.  By Julián Arribas' count, there were at least thirty-one Spanish editions of the text printed in the sixteenth century alone. That same period also witnessed twelve French translated editions, and one English translation by [[Bartholomew Yong]].&lt;ref&gt;Julián Arribas, “Estudio Bibliográfico: Catalogo de Ejemplares,” in ''Los Siete Libros De La Diana'', by Jorge de Montemayor (London: Tamesis, 1996), 19-83.&lt;/ref&gt;

Felismena's back-story in the ''Diana'', wherein Felismena cross-dresses as a page in order to pursue her faithless lover, was probably Shakespeare's source for his [[Two Gentlemen of Verona]].&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Bullough, ''Narrative and Dramatic Sources of Shakespeare'' (London : New York: Routledge and Paul; Columbia University Press, 1957), volume 1, p. 205-206.&lt;/ref&gt;  Montemayor's ending differs from Shakespeare's play, however, since Montemayor's heroine saves her lover's life; the rekindling of their love is also helped along by Felicia's magic. Speaking more broadly, Geoffrey Bullough, Judith Kennedy, and Stuart Gillespie have all noted that Montemayor's pastoral romance seems to have been foundational for the development of Shakespeare's comedies: they point particularly to Montemayor's influential exploration of love, his emphasis on strong female heroines and their perspectives, and his treatment of amorous intrigue and entanglements.&lt;ref&gt;Bullough 205; Judith M. Kennedy, "Introduction," in ''A Critical Edition of Yong’s Translation of George of Montemayor’s Diana and Gil Polo’s Enamoured Diana'', (Oxford: Clarendon P, 1968), p. lii - liii; and Stuart Gillespie, "Shakespeare's Reading of Modern European Literature," in ''Shakespeare and Renaissance Europe'', ed. Andrew Hadfield and Paul Hammond (London: Arden Shakespeare, 2005), p. 103-104.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Montemayor's ''Diana'' was also a major inspiration for [[Philip Sidney]] in writing the [[New Arcadia#The New Arcadia|''New Arcadia'']].  Montemayor's influence was noticed early on by Sidney's contemporaries: as John Hoskins stated in 1599, "For the web, as it were, of [Sidney's] story, he followed three: Heliodorus in Greek, Sannazarius' ''Arcadia'' in Italian, and ''Diana'' by Montemayor in Spanish."&lt;ref&gt;John Hoskins, ''Directions for Speech and Style'' [1599] (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1935), 41.&lt;/ref&gt;  Sidney in particular seems to have modeled his opening scene between the shepherds Strephon and Klaius on Montemayor's Sireno and Sylvano.&lt;ref&gt;Victor Skretkowicz, "General Introduction," in Philip Sidney, ''The Countess of Pembroke’s Arcadia'' (The New Arcadia), ed. Victor Skretkowicz (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1987), p. xix.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Miguel de Cervantes]] mentions the ''Diana'' with both approval and criticism in the book-burning episode of his ''[[Don Quixote]]'' (part I, chapter 6), where Quixote's friend the priest declares the book too good to be thrown in the fire like the rest:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;  And opening one, [the priest] saw that it was ''Diana'', by Jorge de Montemayor, and he said, believing that all the others were of the same genre:
  "These do not deserve to be burned like the rest, because they do not and will not cause the harm that books of chivalry have, for they are books of the understanding and do no injury to anyone.  [...]  To begin with Montemayor's ''Diana'', I am of the opinion that it should not be burned, but that everything having to do with the wise Felicia and the enchanted water, and almost all the long verses, should be excised, and let it happily keep all the prose and the honor of being the first of such books."&lt;ref&gt;Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra, ''Don Quixote'', trans. Edith Grossman (New York: Ecco, 2003), p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Eau de toilette''' ({{IPA-fr|o d(ə) twalɛt|lang}}) literally translated as '''toilet water''' (but more appropriately described as "grooming water") is a lightly scented [[eau de cologne|cologne]] used as a skin freshener.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/toilet+water The Free Dictionary definition]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.macmillandictionary.com/thesaurus/british/rose-water/rose-water_3/Perfume MacMillan Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/toilet-water|title=Definition of "toilet water"|work=[[Collins English Dictionary]]|accessdate=27 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=n|In this context, "toilette"/"toilet" has its older meaning of [[personal grooming]]; the name predates [[toilet|the modern sense of "toilet"]], which was originally [[euphemism|euphemistic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Murray|first=James|authorlink=James Murray (lexicographer)|title=Oxford English Dictionary|edition=1st|chapterurl=https://archive.org/stream/oedxaarch#page/n119/mode/1up|volume=Vol.10 Part 1: Ti–U|year=1926|publisher=Clarendon Press|location=Oxford|page=108|chapter=toilet ''sb.'' §§7,9b}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} It is also referred to as '''"aromatic waters"''' and has a high alcohol content.&lt;ref&gt;Cristiani, p. 117&lt;/ref&gt; It is usually applied directly to the skin after bathing or shaving.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.proz.com/kudoz/english/cosmetics_beauty/2455435-toilet_water.html toilet water term meaning]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.antiquebottles.com/poch/15.html Distinguishing Colognes, Perfumes, Scents, &amp; Toilet Waters]&lt;/ref&gt; It was originally composed of alcohol and various [[volatile oils]].&lt;ref&gt;Cox, p. 118&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally these products were named after a principal ingredient; some being geranium water, lavender water, lilac water, violet water, spirit of myrcia and 'eau de Bretfeld'.&lt;ref&gt;Ebert, p. 304&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, eau de toilette was sometimes referred to as "toilet water".&lt;ref&gt;Lawless, p. 39&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern perfumery, the term eau de toilette is generally used to describe the concentration of fragrance, with eau de toilette being weaker than [[Perfume|Eau de Parfum]] and stronger than [[Eau de Cologne]].&lt;ref name="BS Lacey"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lacey|first1=Miriam|title=Fragrance Defined: Parfum vs. EDP vs. EDT vs. Cologne|url=http://www.bellasugar.com/Eau-de-Toilette-Eau-de-Parfum-Parfum-What-Mean-19193129|website=bellsugar.com|publisher=Bell Sugar|accessdate=27 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GL 2010"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Aug 8 2010|title=What is the difference between eau de parfum and eau de toilette in perfumes and colognes?|url=http://www.gildedlife.com/2010/08/what-is-the-difference-between-eau-de-parfum-and-eau-de-toilette-in-perfumes-and-colognes/|website=gildedlife.com|publisher=Gilded Life|accessdate=27 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eau de toilette is a weaker concentration of fragrance than pure perfume.&lt;ref&gt;Baker, p. 262&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fettner, p. 102&lt;/ref&gt; The concentration of aromatic ingredients is typically as follows (ascending concentration):
* Splash and After shave: 1–3% [[aromatic compound]]s
* [[Eau de Cologne]] (EdC): Citrus type perfumes with about 2–6% perfume concentrate aromatic compounds&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cologne|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/125986/cologne|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Eau de Toilette (EdT): 5–15% (typical ~10%) aromatic compounds
* Eau de Parfum (EdP), Parfum de Toilette (PdT): 10–20% (typical ~15%) aromatic compounds. Sometimes listed as "eau de perfume" or "millésime".
* Perfume extract (Extrait): 15–40% ([[International Fragrance Association|IFRA]]: typical 20%) aromatic compounds

Perfume oils are often diluted with a solvent, though this is not always the case, and its necessity is disputed. By far the most common solvent for perfume oil dilution is ethanol or a mixture of ethanol and water. Perfume has a mixture of about 10–20% perfume oils mixed with alcohol (acting as a diffusing agent delivering the fragrant odor) and a trace of water. Colognes have about 3–5% perfume oil mixed with 80–90% alcohol with about 5 to 15 percent water in the mix. Originally, [[eau de cologne]] was a mixture of citrus oils from such fruits as lemons, oranges, tangerines, limes, and grapefruits. These were combined with such substances as lavender and [[neroli]] (orange-flower oil). Toilet water has the least amount of perfume oil mixture among the three main liquid "perfumery" categories. It has only about 2 to 8 percent of some type of perfume oil and 60–80% alcohol dispersent with water making up the difference.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.answers.com/topic/perfume perfume]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Groom329"&gt;Groom, p. 329&lt;/ref&gt; Toilet waters are a less concentrated form of these above types of alcohol-based perfumes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/eau+de+toilette ''eau de toil'' definition from the online Free Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://thesaurus.com/browse/toilet+water Thesaurus online dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally cologne is usually made of citrus oils and fragrances, while toilet waters are not limited to this specification.&lt;ref&gt;Grolier, p. 154&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Consumer reports'', pp. 409–411&lt;/ref&gt;

== History   ==
In the fourteenth century Hungarian Eau de toilette, predecessor of [[eau de cologne]], was produced.&lt;ref&gt;Müller, p. 348&lt;/ref&gt; [[Elisabeth of Poland, Queen of Hungary|Queen Elisabeth of Hungary]] (1305–1380) had created a fragrant oil mix with alcohol that evaporated slowly on her skin.&lt;ref name="Sherrow125"/&gt; [[Hungary Water]] was the first toilet water developed.&lt;ref name="Stoddart154"/&gt; This toilet water was called "eau de la reine de hongrie", and was based on rosemary.&lt;ref name="HistoryofPerfume"&gt;[http://www.everythinkaboutperfume.com/history.html The History of Perfume] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150208043220/http://www.everythinkaboutperfume.com/history.html |date=2015-02-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

King of France [[Louis XIV]] (1638–1715) used a concoction of scents called "heavenly water" to perfume his shirts; It consisted of [[Agarwood|aloewood]], [[musk]], [[Orange (fruit)|orange flower]], [[rose water]] and other [[spice]]s.&lt;ref name="Sherrow125"&gt;Sherrow, p. 125 ''King Louis XIV (1638–1715) had his shirts scented with toilet water that included aloewood, rosewood, orangle flower, musk, and spices. The concoction was called "heavenly water" ...''&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Eau de toilette were once considered restorative skin toners with medical benefits.&lt;ref&gt;Better Nutrition magazine, Nov 1999, p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hiss, pp. 918–919&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frank, p. 414&lt;/ref&gt; The journal [[Medical Record (journal)|Medical Record]] reported in 1905 that a toilet water spray restores energies lost in business, social, and domestic situations.&lt;ref&gt;Dewey, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=bclNAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA333&amp;dq=perfume+%22toilet+water%22+define&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=mId1TJbbMIGclgfV1-zJBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CGAQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=perfume%20%22toilet%20water%22%20define&amp;f=false Interstate druggist, Volume 7, page 333]&lt;/ref&gt; During the fourteenth through sixteenth centuries a type of toilet water called "plague waters" was supposed to drive away the [[bubonic plague]].&lt;ref name="Stoddart154"&gt;Stoddart, p. 154&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=58687 Dictionary of Traded Goods and Commodities, 1550–1820 by Nancy Cox and Karin Dannehl]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Entertainment Merchants Association''' ('''EMA''') is the [[not-for-profit]] international trade association dedicated to advancing the interests of the $32 billion [[home video|home entertainment]] [[entertainment industry|industry]].

The Mission of EMA is to promote, to protect, and to provide a forum for, the common business interests of those engaged in the sale, rental, and licensed reproduction of entertainment software, such as motion pictures, video games, and sound recordings.

==History==
The Entertainment Merchants Association was established in 2006 through the merger of the [[Interactive Entertainment Merchants Association]] (IEMA) and the Video Software Dealers Association (VSDA). VSDA was organized in 1981 to help video retail stores fight against federal legislation that would have changed the [[first-sale doctrine]]. VSDA was initiated under the auspices of NARM (National Association of Recording Merchandisers), and was headed by Association staff President Risa Solomon.

==Composition==
EMA represents more than 1,000 companies throughout the [[United States]], [[Canada]], and other nations. Its members operate more than 20,000 [[retail outlets]] in the U.S. that sell and/or rent [[DVDs]] and computer and console [[video games]]. Membership comprises the full spectrum of retailers (from single-store specialists to multi-line mass merchants), distributors, the home video divisions of major and independent [[motion picture studio]]s, video game publishers, and other related businesses that constitute and support the home entertainment industry.

[[File:Film Crew.jpg|thumb|upright=1.36|right|Film crew and equipment on a location shoot]]

A '''film crew''' is a group of people, hired by a production company, for the purpose of [[Filmmaking|producing a film or motion picture]]. The ''[[crew]]'' is distinguished from the ''cast'' as the ''cast'' are understood to be the [[actor]]s who appear in front of the [[camera]] or provide voices for characters in the film. The ''crew'' is also separate from the ''producers'' as the ''producers'' are the ones who own a portion of either the film company or the film's [[intellectual property rights]]. A film crew is divided into different departments, each of which specializes in a specific aspect of the production. Film crew positions have evolved over the years, spurred by technological change, but many traditional jobs date from the early 20th century and are common across jurisdictions and film-making cultures.

Motion picture projects have three discrete stages: development, production and distribution. Within the production stage there are also three clearly defined sequential phases — pre-production, principal photography and post-production — and many film crew positions are associated with only one or two of the phases. Distinctions are also made between [[Above the line (filmmaking)|above-the-line]] personnel (such as the director, the screenwriter and the producers) who begin their involvement during the project's development stage, and the [[Below the line (filmmaking)|below-the-line]] "technical" crew involved only with the production stage.

== Director ==

A film director is a person who directs the making of a film. The director most often has the highest authority on a film set. Generally, a film director controls a film's artistic and dramatic aspects and visualizes the screenplay (or script) while guiding the technical crew and actors in the fulfillment of that vision. The director has a key role in choosing the cast members, production design, and the creative aspects of filmmaking.[1] Under European Union law, the director is viewed as the author of the film.[2]

The film director gives direction to the cast and crew and creates an overall vision through which a film eventually becomes realized, or noticed. Directors need to be able to mediate differences in creative visions and stay within the boundaries of the film's budget. There are many pathways to becoming a film director. [3] Some film directors started as screenwriters, cinematographers, film editors or actors. Other film directors have attended a film school. Directors use different approaches. Some outline a general plotline and let the actors improvise dialogue, while others control every aspect, and demand that the actors and crew follow instructions precisely. Some directors also write their own screenplays or collaborate on screenplays with long-standing writing partners. Some directors edit or appear in their films, or compose the music score for their films.[4]

== Production ==

''Production'' is generally not considered a department as such, but rather as a series of functional groups. These include the film's producers and executive producers and production office staff such as the production manager, the production coordinator, and their assistants; the various assistant directors; the accounting staff and sometimes the locations manager and their assistants.

'''[[Film producer|Producer]]'''
:A film producer creates the conditions for film-making. The producer initiates, coordinates, supervises, and controls matters such as fund raising, hiring key personnel, and arranging for distributors. The producer is involved throughout all phases of the film making process from development to completion of a project. There may be several producers on a film who may take a role in a number of areas, such as development, financing or production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Producers Guild Awards |url = https://socialbilitty.com/2014/03/producers-guild-awards/ |date = March 16, 2014 |publisher = ''[[Socialbilitty]]'' |access-date = January 13, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
'''Executive producer'''
:An executive producer (EP) is a producer who was not involved in the technical aspects of the film-making process in the original definition, but has played a financial or creative role in ensuring that the project goes into production.[1] Today, however, the title has become ambiguous,[2] particularly in feature films. Since the 1980s, it has become increasingly common for the line producer to be given the title of executive producer, while the initiating producer takes the "produced by" credit. On other projects, the reverse happens, with the line producer taking the "produced by" credit. So the two credits have become effectively interchangeable, with no precise definition.

=== Production office ===

'''[[Line producer]]'''
: The line producer is the liaison between the studio or producer and the production manager, responsible for managing the [[production budget]]. The title is associated with the idea that they are the person who is "on the line" on a day-to-day basis, and responsible for lining up the resources needed.
'''[[Production assistant]]'''
: Production assistants, referred to as PAs, assist in the production office or in various departments with general tasks, such as assisting the first assistant director with set operations.

==== Production managements ====

'''[[Unit production manager|Production manager]]'''
: The production manager supervises the physical aspects of the production (not the creative aspects) including personnel, technology, budget, and scheduling. It is the production manager's responsibility to make sure the filming stays on schedule and within its budget. The PM also helps manage the day-to-day budget by managing operating costs such as salaries, production costs, and everyday equipment rental costs. The PM often works under the supervision of a line producer and directly supervises the production coordinator.
'''[[Unit production manager|Assistant production manager]]'''
:The assistant production manager is the assistant to the production manager (PM) and carries out various jobs for the PM. Normally only big budget Hollywood feature films have an assistant PM.
'''[[Unit production manager|Unit manager]]'''
: The unit manager fulfils the same role as the production manager but for secondary "unit" shooting. In some functional structures, the unit manager subsumes the role of the transport coordinator.
'''[[Production coordinator]]'''
: The production coordinator is the information nexus of the production, responsible for organizing all the logistics from hiring crew, renting equipment, and booking talent. The PC is an integral part of film production.



; [[Assistant director|First assistant director]]
: The first assistant director (1st AD) assists the production manager and director. The ultimate aim of any 1st AD is to ensure the film comes in on schedule while maintaining a working environment in which the director, principal artists (actors) and crew can be focused on their work. They oversee day-to-day management of the cast and crew scheduling, equipment, script, and set. A 1st AD may also be responsible for directing background action for major shots or the entirety of relatively minor shots, at the director's discretion.
; [[Assistant director|Second assistant director]]
: The second assistant director (2nd AD) is the chief assistant of the 1st AD and helps carry out those tasks delegated to the 1st AD. The 2nd AD may also direct background action and [[extra (drama)|extras]] in addition to helping the 1st AD with scheduling, booking, etc. The 2nd AD is responsible for creating call sheets that let the crew know the schedule and important details about the shooting day.
; Other assistant directors
:Sometimes other assistant directors are needed such as in Canadian and British functional structures the 3rd assistant director (3rd AD) and even trainee assistant directors (trainee AD). In the American system there are 2nd 2nd assistant director (2nd 2nd AD). Normally in the American system 2nd 2nd ADs control big crowd extras and make sure if shooting on location none of the public get into shots.

==== Accounting ====

;'''[[Accountant|Production accountant]]'''
: Production accountants manage the money and ensure the production comes in on budget and everyone gets paid. The industry is notorious for unusual accounting methods which are collectively labelled [[Hollywood accounting]]. Production accountants are often assisted by assistant accountants, sometimes called clerks, responsible for accounts receivable, accounts payable and payroll.

=== Locations ===

; [[Location manager]]
: Oversees the locations department and its staff, typically reporting directly to the production manager or assistant director (or even director or executive producer). Location manager is responsible for final clearing (or guaranteeing permission to use) a location for filming and must often assist production and finance departments in maintaining budget management regarding actual location/permit fees as well as labor costs to production for the locations department at large.
; Assistant location manager
: Works with the location manager and the various departments in arranging technical scouts for the essential staff (grips, electric, camera, etc.) to see options which the location manager has selected for filming. The assistant location manager will be onset during the filming process to oversee the operation, whereas the location manager continues pre-production from elsewhere (generally an office) on the upcoming locations. (Note: On most location-based television shows, there will be two assistant location managers that alternate episodes, allowing one to prep an upcoming episode while the other is on-set with the current one.)
; [[Location scout]]
: Does much of the actual research, footwork and photography to document location possibilities. Often the location manager will do some scouting themselves, as well as the assistant location manager.
; Location assistant
: Hired by the location manager to be on-set before, during, and after the filming process. General responsibilities include arriving first at the location to allow the set dressers into the set for preparation; maintaining the cleanliness of the location areas during filming; fielding complaints from neighbours; and ultimately, at the end of the filming, making sure it seems as though the film crew was never there. There is generally one to three assistants on a shoot at any given time.
; Location production assistant
: This position exists generally on larger budget productions. The locations PA is the assistant who is almost never on-set, but instead is always prepping a location or "wrapping" a location; that is, when a location requires several days of setup and breakdown preceding and following the day(s) of filming. A location production assistant is what a set production assistant is in Canada.

=== Additional production credits ===

Since the turn of the 21st century, several additional professionals are now routinely listed in the production credits on most major motion pictures.
;'''[[Publicist|Unit publicist]]'''
: The publicist liaises between the film production and the media. They create press releases, in collaboration with the producers, and work with the [[unit still photographer]].
;'''[[Lawyer|Legal counsel]]'''
: Entertainment lawyers negotiate contracts, clear licensing rights for any intellectual property used in the film, obtain tax credits from local governments, and take care of immigration paperwork when cast or crew cross international borders to shoot on location.
; [[System administrator]]
: A system administrator or sysadmin, is a person employed to maintain and operate a computer system or network. This role is increasingly important for digital monitors on set, digital intermediate editing and post production, digital effects, digital sound, and sometimes for full digital production.

=== Continuity ===

; [[Script supervisor]]
: Also known as the ''continuity person'', the script supervisor keeps track of what parts of the script have been filmed and makes notes of any deviations between what was actually filmed and what appeared in the script. They make notes on every shot, and keep track of props, blocking, and other details to ensure continuity between shots and scenes. An important part of a script supervisor's job is to make sure that actors' movements, the directions they are looking in a shot, particularly when speaking to or responding to another actor, plus the positions of props they are using and every thing else matches from shot to shot. If there is an apparent mismatch, the director must be informed immediately so that it can be reshot before the lighting setup is changed or at least before the location is wrapped and the set is struck. Not only does the job of script supervisor require a great deal of awareness and meticulous note-taking skills, it also requires much diplomacy to advise the director that they may have a problem editing something just recorded. The script supervisor is also in charge of providing the "official" scene numbers and take numbers to the second camera assistant (clapper loader in some countries) for the slate, as well as to the sound mixer, and to clearly note which take the director has chosen to be used (as a "print," in film terms) in the finished product. All of this information is then relayed to the editor every day after shooting has wrapped in the form of copies made of both the script supervisor's notes as well as their matching script pages.

=== Casting ===

; [[Casting director]]
:The casting director chooses the actors for the characters of the film. This usually involves inviting potential actors to read an excerpt from the script for an audition.
; Cast PA
:The cast PA assists the actors  of the film. This usually involves personal and technical requests, that might be highly sensible and private or common domain or knowledge.

== Camera and lighting ==

[[File:Charlton Heston as Antony in Julius Caesar, B&amp;W image by Chalmers Butterfield.jpg|thumb|upright=1.36|A [[Camera operator]] filming a scene from the 1950 Hollywood film ''[[Julius Caesar (1950 film)|Julius Caesar]]'' starring [[Charlton Heston]]]]

[[File:FilmCrew.jpg|thumb|upright=1.36|The production was for the TV movie Sherlock Holmes and the Case of the Silk Stocking at Somerset House in London.]]

; [[Director of photography]]
: The director of photography, DoP or DP, is in charge of the look of the "frame" of the movie shots, hence the name "photography". He is the chief of the camera and lighting crew of the film. The DoP makes decisions on lighting and framing of shots in conjunction with the film's director. Typically, the director tells the DoP how they want a shot to look, and the DoP chooses the correct lens, filter, lighting and composition to achieve the desired aesthetic effect. The DoP is the senior creative crew member after the director.
: The term ''[[Cinematographer]]'' is usually synonymous with ''director of photography'', though some professionals insist this only applies when the director of photography and camera operator are the same person.

=== Camera ===

; [[Camera operator]]
: The camera operator uses the camera at the direction of the cinematographer, director of photography, or the film director to capture the scenes on film or video. Generally, a cinematographer or director of photography does not operate the camera, but sometimes these jobs may be combined.
; [[First assistant camera]]
: The first assistant camera, 1st AC or ''' focus puller''', is responsible for keeping the camera in focus as it is shooting, as well as building the camera at the beginning of the day and taking it apart at the end. They also thread the film when a new magazine is loaded.
; [[Second assistant camera]]
: The second assistant camera, 2nd AC or '''[[Clapper loader]]''', operates the [[clapperboard]] commonly referred to in the United States as a "Slate" at the beginning of each take and loads the raw [[film stock]] or blank videocassette into the camera magazines between takes, if there is no additional specifically designated film loader. The 2nd AC is also in charge of overseeing the meticulously kept notebooks that record when the film stock is received, used, and sent to the lab for processing. Additionally, the 2nd AC oversees organization of camera equipment and transport of the equipment from one shooting location to another.
; Film loader
: The loader transfers motion picture film from the manufacturer's light-tight canisters to the camera magazines for attachment to the camera by the 2nd AC. After exposure during filming, the loader then removes the film from the magazines and places it back into the light-tight cans for transport to the laboratory. It is the responsibility of the loader to manage the inventory of film and communicate with the 1st AC on the film usage and remaining stock throughout the day. On small production crews, this job is often combined with the 2nd AC. With the prevalence of digital photography, this role is taken on by the digital imaging technician.
; Camera production assistant
: The camera PA, ''' camera intern''' or ''' camera trainee''', assists the crew while learning the trade of the camera assistant, operator or cinematographer.
; [[Digital imaging technician]]
: On digital photography productions the digital imaging technician, or DIT, is responsible for the coordination of the internal workings of the digital camera. Under the direction of the cinematographer or director of photography, the DIT will make adjustments to the multitude of variables available in most professional digital cameras to creatively or technically manipulate the resulting image. It may also be the responsibility of the DIT to archive and manage the digital data, create compressed dailies from raw footage and prepare all digital images for post-production.
; Steadicam operator
: A steadicam operator is someone who is skilled at operating a [[Steadicam]] (trademark for a camera stabilization rig). This person is usually one of the camera operators on the production.
; Motion control technician/Operator
: This technician operates a [[Motion control photography|motion control rig]], which essentially is a 'camera robot' able to consistently repeat camera moves for special effects uses. Motion control rigs are typically rented with an experienced operator.

=== Lighting ===

; [[Gaffer (motion picture industry)|Gaffer]]
: The gaffer is the head of the lighting department, responsible for the design of the lighting plan for a production. Sometimes the gaffer is credited as ''' chief lighting technician'''.
; [[Best boy]] (lighting)
: The best boy is the chief assistant to the gaffer. They are not usually on set, but dealing with the electric truck, rentals, manpower, and other logistics.
; [[Lighting technician]] / Electrics
: Also called Electrics or Lamp Operators, Lighting technicians are involved with setting up and controlling lighting equipment and temporary power distribution on set.

=== Grip ===

[[Grip (job)|Grips]] are trained lighting and rigging technicians. Their main responsibility is to work closely with the electrical department to put in the non-electrical components of lighting set-ups required for a shot, such as flags, overheads, and bounces. On the [[sound stage]], they move and adjust major set pieces when something needs to be moved to get a camera into position. In the US and Canada they may belong to the [[International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees]].

; [[Key grip]]
: The key grip is the chief grip on a set, and is the head of the set operations department. The key grip works with the director of photography to help set up the set and to achieve correct lighting and [[Blocking (stage)|blocking]]. They are also used to  Manoeuver the cameras around the set.
; [[Best boy]] (grip)
: The best boy is chief assistant to the key grip. They are also responsible for organizing the grip truck throughout the day.
; [[Dolly grip]]
: The grip in charge of operating the [[Camera dolly|camera dollies]] and [[Crane shot|camera cranes]] is called the dolly grip. They place, level, and move the dolly track, then push and pull the dolly, and usually a camera operator and camera assistant as riders.
; [[Grip (job)|Grips]]
: Grips report to the key grip and are responsible for lifting heavy things and setting rigging points for lights.
; Sound Grip
: Similar to grips, in regards to the kinds of role they play on set; however, sound grips will also report to the production sound mixer and serve as a critical link between these departments.

== Production sound ==

; [[Production sound mixer]]
: The production sound mixer (or sound recordist) is the head of the Sound Department on location and is responsible for the operation of the audio Mixer and Recorder(s) which receive feeds from the microphones on set. It is their responsibility to decide how they will deploy their team to capture the sound for each shot, select which microphones will be used for each setup, mix audio from all of the microphones in real time into a "mix track" that will be used while viewing rushes and during the edit, and sometimes in the final film, and to maintain logs of audio related issues for post production. The sound mixer is considered a department head, and is thus completely responsible for all aspects of production sound.
; [[Boom operator (media)|Boom operator]]
: The boom operator, first assistant sound or "1st AS", is responsible for utilising microphones on the end of boom poles (lightweight telescopic poles made of aluminium, or more commonly, carbon fibre) held above actor's heads during a scene to capture dialogue. It is also their responsibility to relay information from the "floor" back to the production sound mixer regarding upcoming shots, troublesome noises that the mixer will need to be made aware of if they can't be silenced, and for mounting radio microphones on actors. In France, the boom operator is called the [[Perchman]].
; Second assistant sound
: The second assistant sound, sound utility technician, or "2nd AS", is the assistant to the boom operator and is responsible for moving and preparing sound equipment for use around the set while the boom op watches rehearsals and prepares for the next shot, as well as handling wireless audio feeds to the director, script supervisor and producers, and laying carpet and other sound dampening materials in locations with problematic floors or a troublesome acoustic. In addition, the 2nd AS is regularly called upon to operate a second boom in scenes with a larger number of actors or where actors are physically spaced too far apart for the 1st AS to cover all of the dialogue with one microphone. The 2nd AS also regularly aids in the radio mic'ing of cast when there are a large number of actors in a scene. The term "sound utility technician" is now considered an outdated term by [[BECTU]] in the UK and 2nd AS is preferred, with sound utility technician as a role being omitted from recent versions of the rate card.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.bectu.org.uk/advice-resources/library/1568 |title=Archived copy |access-date=May 8, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160603005305/https://www.bectu.org.uk/advice-resources/library/1568 |archive-date=June 3, 2016 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The role is sometimes informally known as a "cable wrangler" or "cable boy".

== Art department ==

The art department in a major feature film can often number hundreds of people. Usually it is considered to include several sub-departments: the art department proper, with its art director, set designers and draftsmen; set decoration, under the set decorator; props, under the props master; construction, headed by the construction coordinator; scenic, headed by the key scenic artist; and special effects.

; [[Production designer]]

: The production designer is responsible for creating the visual appearance of the film – settings, costumes, character makeup, all taken as a unit. The production designer works closely with the director and the director of photography to achieve the ''look'' of the film.

=== Art (sets and graphic art) ===

Within the overall art department is a sub-department, also called the art department—which can be confusing. This consists of the people who design the sets and create the graphic art.

; [[Art director#In film|Art director]]
: The art director reports to the production designer, and more directly oversees artists and craftspeople, such as the set designers, graphic artists, and illustrators who give form to the production design as it develops. The art director works closely with the construction coordinator and key scenic artist to oversee the aesthetic and textural details of sets as they are realized. Typically, the art director oversees the budget and schedule of the overall art department. On large-budget productions with numerous sets and several art directors, one might be credited as ''' supervising art director''' or ''' senior art director'''.
; Standby art director
: In the organizational system used in the UK and Ireland, the standby art director monitors the art department's work on set during filming on behalf of the production designer. They work closely with the standby painters and standby carpenters, and co-ordinate any changes to the set during filming. In the North American system, this work is shared between the props master and the on-set dresser.
; Assistant art director
: The first, second and third assistant art directors carry out the instructions of the art director. Their work often involves measuring locations and collecting other pertinent information for the production designer. Sometimes a set designer is also the first assistant art director. In this capacity, they manage the workflow and act as the ''foreman'' of the drawing office.
; [[Set designer]]
: The set designer is the draftsman, often an architect, who realizes the structures or interior spaces called for by the production designer.
; [[Illustrator]]
: The illustrator draws or paints visual representations of the designs to communicate the ideas imagined by the production designer. Illustrators are sometimes credited as concept artists.
; [[Graphic artist]]
: The graphic artist is responsible for the design and creation of all graphic elements, including: signs, billboards, posters, logos, nameplates, and automotive-wrapping — that are created specifically for the film. They will often create several versions of a design, the preferred of which then being chosen by the production designer. On certain productions, they may also be employed, under the direction of the props master, in the creation of small, printed items, such as fliers, receipts, bills of sale, etc.

=== Sets ===

; [[Set decorator]]
: The set decorator is in charge of the decorating of a film set, which includes the furnishings and all the other objects that will be seen in the film. They work closely with the production designer and coordinate with the art director. In recognition of the set decorator's importance, the [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for art direction is given jointly to both the production designer and the set decorator.
; Buyer
: The buyer works with, and reports to, the set decorator. The buyer locates, and then purchases or rents the set dressing.
; [[Leadman]]
: The leadman (or leadsman) is the foreman of the set dressing crew, often referred to as the [[swing gang]]. They also assist the set decorator.
; Set dresser
: The set dressers apply and remove the "dressing"; i.e., furniture, drapery, carpets, wall signs, vinyl decals—everything one would find in a location, (even doorknobs and wall sockets, when such items do not fall under the purview of construction.) Most of the swing gang's work occurs before and after the shooting crew arrives, but one set dresser remains with the shooting crew and is known as the ''' on-set dresser'''. In some countries, such as [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] or the [[United Kingdom]], the set dressing department is referred to as ''' dressing props''' department. Informally, in the U.S., the department is often referred to simply as ''set dec''.
; [[Greensman]]
: The greensman is a specialised set dresser dealing with the artistic arrangement or landscape design of plant material, sometimes real and sometimes artificial, and usually a combination of both. Depending on the scope of the greens work in a film, the greensman may report to the art director or may report directly to the production designer. If a significant amount of greens work is required in a film, then the greens may be an identifiable sub-department, with its own team – often of a size numbering double figures – and hierarchy (e.g., Greensmaster, greens supervisor, foreperson, leading hand, laborers). Specialists from other areas of the art dept. (e.g., Fabricators, sculptors, painters/Scenics) may also be drafted to work exclusively on greens.

=== Construction ===

; Construction coordinator
: The construction coordinator oversees the construction of all the sets. The coordinator orders materials, schedules the work, and supervises the often sizeable construction crew of carpenters, painters and labourers. In some jurisdictions the construction coordinator is called the ''' construction manager'''.
; Head carpenter
: The head carpenter is the foreman of a ''gang'' of carpenters and laborers.
; Propmaker
: The propmaker, as the name implies, builds the props that are used for the film. In US jurisdictions, propmakers are carpenters who build props and sets, and are often technicians skilled in wood and metalwork.

=== Scenic ===

; [[Charge scenic artist|Key scenic]]
: The key scenic artist is responsible for the surface treatments of the sets. This includes special paint treatments such as aging and gilding, as well as simulating the appearance of wood, stone, brick, metal, stained glass--anything called for by the production designer. The key scenic artist supervises the crew of painters, and is often a master craftsperson. In the UK, the above responsibilities would normally be those of the ''' head painter''', and the scenic artist is responsible for producing artist painted backings. In the US a key scenic is called the ''' charge scenic '''.
; Head of Plaster
: The Head of the Plastering Department is responsible for managing Fibrous Plasterers, who are highly skilled plasters who can re-create any period, using mold making and casting abilities.

=== Property ===

; [[Property Master|Propmaster]]
: The property master is in charge of finding and managing all the [[Theatrical property|props]] that appear in the film. These include any item handled by an actor that is not part of the scenery or costumes, and all consumable food items that appear on screen. Job responsibilities include purchasing, renting, and manufacturing anything an actor handles or touches. In period works, it is the property master's job to ensure that all the props provided are accurate to the time period. The propmaster usually has several assistants. The Assistant Propmaster generally is the person running the set and in charge of working directly with the actors, director and on set crew.
; [[Weapons master]]
: The weapons master, or ''' armorer''', is a specialized prop technician who deals with firearms. In most jurisdictions this requires special training and licenses.

=== Costume department ===

; [[Costume designer]]
: The costume designer is responsible for all the clothing and costumes worn by all the actors that appear on screen. They are also responsible for designing, planning, and organizing the construction of the garments down to the fabric, colors, and sizes. The costume designer works closely with the director to understand and interpret "character", and counsels with the production designer to achieve an overall tone of the film. In large productions, the costume designer will usually have one or more assistant costume designers.
; Costume supervisor
: The costume supervisor works closely with the designer. In addition to helping with the design of the costumes, they manage the wardrobe workspace. They supervise construction or sourcing of garments, hiring and firing of support staff, budget, paperwork, and department logistics. Also called the ''' wardrobe supervisor''', although this term is used less and less.
; Key costumer
: The key costumer is employed on larger productions to manage the set costumers, and to handle the star's wardrobe needs.
; Costume standby
: The costume standby is present on set at all times. It is his/her responsibility to monitor the quality and continuity of the actors and actresses costumes before and during takes. (S)he will also assist the actors and actresses with dressing.
; Breakdown artist
: A breakdown artist may be employed during the pre-production period to ''break down'' garments. This specialized job includes making new clothing appear dirty, faded and worn.
; Costume buyer
: On large productions a buyer may be employed to source and purchase fabrics and garments. A buyer might also be referred to as a ''' shopper'''. This distinction is often made when the lead actor in a production has control over their wardrobe, and they may personally hire this person.
; Cutter
: A costume technician who fits or tailors costumes, usually on-set. They might also be called ''' fitter''', ''' seamstress''' or ''' tailor'''. Some celebrity actors have favorite cutters, and larger productions may hire several and have them on set at the same time, particularly in period film projects that might have complicated or expensive extras wardrobe.

=== Hair and make-up ===

Some actors or actresses have personal makeup artists or hair stylists.

; [[Make-up artist|Key make-up artist]]
: The key makeup artist is the department head that answers directly to the director and production designer. They are responsible for planning makeup designs for all leading and supporting cast. Their department includes all cosmetic makeup, body makeup and if special effects are involved, the key make-up artist will consult with a special effects makeup team to create all prosthetics and SFX makeup in a production. It is common that the key makeup artist performs makeup applications on lead cast, with assistance, and allows other crew members to work with supporting and minor roles. The key makeup artist will normally execute especially complicated or important makeup processes that are to be featured on camera.
; Special make-up effects Artist (SFX makeup)
:A special effects make-up artist works with live models or structures in the entertainment industry, applying make-up effects or [[prosthetics]]. May be an own department that answers directly to the director and production designer or reports to the Key make-up artist.
; Make-up supervisor
: The make-up supervisor is a supporting position that normally reports to the key makeup artist to assist in running the makeup department. Make-up supervisors typically handle production matters and generally serve the needs of senior artists. Makeup supervisors rarely do makeup themselves. Their duties can include keeping a record of makeup continuity, handing the scheduling of makeup teams and providing for the general needs of the makeup department. They are expected to be a connection between the makeup department and the rest of the production departments, making sure that makeup supplies, production assistants or electricians are on hand when needed.
; [[Make-up artist]]
: Make-up artists work with makeup, hair and special effects to create the characters look for anyone appearing on screen. They assist and report to the key make-up artist.
; [[Hairdresser|Key hair]]
: The key hair is the department head that answers directly to the director and production designer. The key hair will normally design and style the hair of lead actors.
; Hair stylist
:The ''' hair stylist''', is responsible for maintaining and styling the hair, including wigs and extensions, of anyone appearing on screen. They assist and report to the key hair.

== Special effects ==

This department oversees the mechanical effects—also called [[Practical effect|practical]] or [[physical effects]]—that create optical illusions during live-action shooting. It is not to be confused with the [[Visual effects]] department, which adds photographic effects during filming to be altered later during [[video editing]] in the [[post-production]] process.

; [[Special effects supervisor]]
: The special effects supervisor instructs the [[Special effects]] crew on how to design moving set elements and props that will safely break, explode, burn, collapse and implode without destroying the film set. S/he is also responsible for reproducing weather conditions and other on-camera ''magic''.
; Special effects assistant
: The SFX assistants carry out the instructions of the special effects supervisor, building set pieces like breakaway furniture and cities in miniature, lighting pyrotechnics, and setting up rigging equipment for stunts.

== Stunts ==

; [[Stunt coordinator]]
: Where the film requires a [[stunt]] and involves the use of [[stunt performer]]s, the stunt coordinator will arrange the casting and performance of the stunt, working closely with the director and the 1st AD.

== Post-production ==

; Post-production supervisor
: Post-production supervisors are responsible for the post-production process, during which they maintain clarity of information and good channels of communication between the producer, editor, supervising sound editor, the facilities companies (such as film labs, CGI studios and negative cutters) and the production accountant. Although this is not a creative role, it is pivotal in ensuring that the film's post-production budget is manageable and achievable, and that all deadlines are met. Because large amounts of money are involved, and most of a film's budget is spent during production, the post-production period can often be difficult and challenging.

=== Editorial ===
; [[Film editor]]
: The film editor is the person who assembles the various shots into a coherent film, with the help of the director. There are usually several assistant editors.
; Negative cutter
: The negative cutter cuts and splices the negatives as directed by the film editor, and then provides the assembled negative reels to the lab in order for prints (positives for projection) to be made.
; [[Color grading|Colorist]]
: With a photochemical process, the color timer adjusts the color of the film via printer lights for greater consistency in the film's colors. With a [[digital intermediate]] process, the colorist can use digital tools in manipulating the image and has greater creative freedom in changing the aesthetic of a film.
; Telecine colorist
: A Telecine colorist is responsible for a ''grade'' – that is a look that has been created with a grading system, which adjusts brightness, contrast and color.

=== Visual effects ===

[[Visual effects]] commonly refers to post-production alterations of the film's images. The on set VFX crew works to prepare shots and plates for future visual effects. This may include adding tracking markers, taking and asking for reference plates and helping the [[Executive director|Director]] understand the limitations and ease of certain shots that will effect the future post production. A VFX crew can also work alongside the [[Special effects]] department for any on-set optical effects that need physical representation during filming (on camera.)

; Visual effects producer
: The visual effects producer works with the visual effects supervisor to break down the script into storyboards, and advises the director as to how s/he should approach the scenes. Together they determine which sequences are to be shot as live action elements, which would work well in miniature, and which (if any) should be computer generated.
; [[VFX Creative Director|Visual effects creative director]]
: VFX creative directors are very much like production designers, except they direct and supervise the creative side of the film's visual effects. The position is particularly in demand for films with massive amounts of computer generated imagery and scenes.
; [[Visual effects supervisor]]
: The visual effects supervisor is in charge of the VFX crew, working with production and the film's director to achieve the desired in-camera optical effects of the film.
; Visual effects editor
: The visual effects editor incorporates visual effects into the current cuts of live action sequences, producing multiple versions of each shot. Altered scenes are then evaluated by the visual effects supervisor and creative director for aesthetic and technical direction, and by the producers for review and final editing.
; Compositor
: A compositor is a visual effects artist responsible for [[compositing]] images from different sources such as video, film, computer generated 3-D imagery, 2-D animations, matte paintings, photographs, and text.
; Rotoscope artists/ paint artists
: Rotoscope &amp; painters artists may [[Rotoscoping|rotoscope]] the footage, manually creating [[Matte (filmmaking)|mattes]] for use in compositing. They may also paint visual information into or out of a scene, such as removing wires and rigs, logos, dust busting, scratch removal, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.fxguide.com/fxtips-243.html |title = Art of Roto (compositing and paint) |first = Matt |last = Silverman |date = June 15, 2004 |accessdate = September 19, 2010 |publisher = fxguide |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100918231459/http://www.fxguide.com/fxtips-243.html |archivedate = September 18, 2010 |df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

; [[Matte painting|Matte painter]]
: Matte painters draw/paint entire sets or extend portions of an existing set.

=== Sound and music ===

; [[Sound designer]]
: The sound designer, or '''supervising sound editor''', is in charge of the post-production sound of a movie. Sometimes this may involve great creative license, and other times it may simply mean working with the director and editor to balance the sound to their liking.
; [[Dialogue editor]]
: The dialogue editor is responsible for assembling and editing all the dialog in the soundtrack.
; [[Sound editor (filmmaking)|Sound editor]]
: The sound editor is responsible for assembling and editing all the sound effects in the soundtrack.
; [[Re-recording mixer]]
: The re-recording mixer balances all of the sounds prepared by the dialogue, music and effects editors, and finalizes the films audio track.
; [[Music supervisor]]
: The music supervisor works with the composer, mixers and editors to create and integrate the film's music. In [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] a music supervisor's primary responsibility is to act as liaison between the film production and the [[recording industry]], negotiating the use rights for all source music used in a film.
; [[Composer]]
: The composer is responsible for writing the [[film score|musical score]] for a film.
; [[Foley artist]]
: The foley artist is the person who creates the post-sync sound effects for a film. These sound effects are recorded in sync to picture and are mostly body movements, footsteps or object manipulations. The most common reason for recording these effects live to picture is the fact that such sounds are lost when the dialogue is removed to be replaced by a foreign language version. Unsatisfactorily recorded sync sound effects can also be replaced with foley effects. Foley artists are also known as foley walkers. Foley is named after its first known practitioner, an early hollywood sound editor named Jack Foley.

; Conductor/ Orchestrator
: A conductor is supposed to be knowledable of special synchronization procedures to conduct the score to an orchestra. An orchestrator is someone who furthers the composer's notes and symbols and fills out the intended notation for the film score.

; Score Recorder/ Mixer
: A score's recorder is someone who recordes the film score and a score's mixer is someone who mixes the film score.

; Music Preparation
: A music preparer is someone who prepares out the score for orchestra performers and who copies out the music.

; Music Editor
: A music editor is someone who edits the film score and works with the composer to make sure it goes with the film.

; (additional orchestration)
: Additional Orchestration people work with the conductor/ orchestrator and edit the film score.

== Animation ==

[[Animation]] film crews have many of the same roles and departments as live-action films (including directing, production, editing, camera, sound, and so on), but nearly all on-set departments (lighting, electrical, grip, sets, props, costume, hair, makeup, special effects, and stunts) were traditionally replaced with a single animation department made up of various types of [[animator]]s (character, effects, in-betweeners, cleanup, and so on). In [[traditional animation]], the nature of the medium meant that ''everything'' was literally flattened into the drawn lines and solid colors that became the characters, making nearly all live-action positions irrelevant. Because animation has traditionally been so labor-intensive and thus expensive, animation films normally have a separate story department in which storyboard artists painstakingly develop scenes to make sure they make sense before they are actually animated.

However, since the turn of the 21st century, modern [[3D computer graphics]] and [[computer animation]] have made possible a level of rich detail never seen before. Many animated films now have specialized artists and animators who act as the virtual equivalent of lighting technicians, grips, costume designers, props masters, set decorators, set dressers, and cinematographers. They make artistic decisions strongly similar to those of their live-action counterparts, but implement them in a virtual space that exists only in software rather than on a physical set. There have been major breakthroughs in the simulation of [[hair]] since 2005, meaning that hairstylists have been called in since then to consult on a few animation projects.

'''''Gia''''' is a 1998 [[Biographical film|biographical]] [[HBO]] film about the life and times of one of [[America|America's]] first [[Supermodel|supermodels]], [[Gia Carangi|Gia Marie Carangi]]. The film stars [[Angelina Jolie]] as Gia and [[Faye Dunaway]] as [[Wilhelmina Cooper]], with [[Mercedes Ruehl]] and [[Elizabeth Mitchell]]. It was directed by [[Michael Cristofer]] and written by Cristofer and [[Jay McInerney]]. The original music score was composed by [[Terence Blanchard]].

== Plot ==
[[Gia Carangi]] ([[Angelina Jolie]]) is a [[Philadelphia]] native who moves to [[New York City]] to become a fashion model and immediately catches the attention of powerful agent [[Wilhelmina Cooper]] ([[Faye Dunaway]]). Gia's attitude and beauty help her rise quickly to the forefront of the modeling industry, but her persistent loneliness after the death of Wilhelmina drives her to experiment with mood-altering drugs like [[cocaine]].

She becomes entangled in a passionate affair with Linda ([[Elizabeth Mitchell]]), a make-up artist. Their love affair first starts when both pose nude and make love to each other after a photo shoot. However, after a while Linda begins to worry about Gia's drug use and gives her an ultimatum; Gia chooses the drugs.

Failed attempts at reconciliation with Linda and with her mother, Kathleen ([[Mercedes Ruehl]]), drive Gia to begin abusing [[heroin]]. Although she is eventually able to break her drug habit after much effort, she has already contracted [[HIV]] from a needle containing infected blood, having already progressed to AIDS.

"'''I Am a Ukrainian'''"  is an Internet [[viral video]], first posted on [[YouTube]] in 2014 featuring a young Ukrainian woman supporting the protestors in the [[2014 Ukrainian revolution]]. At the woman's request, British photographer Graham Mitchell filmed her speaking on the Maidan, and her friend, [[Ben Moses]], edited the material into video he posted on her behalf on YouTube.  By late March that year the video had been viewed over 8 million times.

==Background==
The woman in the video was initially not named&lt;ref name="pp"/&gt; in order to keep her safe,&lt;ref name=hp/&gt; but was eventually identified as [[Yulia Marushevska]], a Kyiv Ph.D. student of Ukrainian literature at [[Taras Shevchenko National University]].&lt;ref&gt;Denys Krasnikov, [https://www.kyivpost.com/special/yulia-marushevska-revolutionary-leader-embodies-hope-ukrainians-bright-corruption-free-future.html Yulia Marushevska: Revolutionary leader embodies hope of Ukrainians for bright corruption-free future], ''[[Kiev Post]]'', December 1, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;  Marushevska conceived, wrote, and produced the video after the death of five people, three of whom died of gunshot wounds, on January 22.&lt;ref name="voanews"/&gt; Marushevska felt she needed to do more for the [[EuroMaidan]], and was frustrated with what she perceived to be the foreigners’ ignorance about why the protests were happening.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} She wanted to inform the viewers that the Ukrainians want to change their government due to concerns over alleged unchecked corruption within it.&lt;ref name=syracuse/&gt; They ended up shooting a 2-minute, 4 second long video&lt;ref name=syracuse/&gt; where she speaks in English.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt;

==Popularity==
After only a few days on YouTube the video had about 3.5 million views.&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt; The video has received mostly positive reception, with the majority of the tens of thousands of comments supportive.&lt;ref name=syracuse/&gt;&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt;&lt;ref name=neo/&gt; By  February 21 the video had approximately 70,000 "likes" and 4,000 "dislikes".&lt;ref name=syracuse/&gt; A minority of voices argued that it is too one-sided.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt;&lt;ref name=neo/&gt; It has also been criticized for its professional production value, invoking a comparison to the controversial [[Kony 2012]] viral video, which misled viewers into thinking it was a purely amateur production.&lt;ref name=neo/&gt;&lt;ref name=thepatriot/&gt;

[[BBC News]] has described it as having the greatest impact of any video from the 2014 Ukrainian revolution.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt; Moses has now completed a feature-length documentary, ''Witness to a Revolution'', about Yulia's and Ukraine's progress in the year following her viral video.&lt;ref name="iamaukrainianmovie"/&gt;

==Aftermath==
In July 2015 [[Mikheil Saakashvili]], Governor of [[Odessa]], announced that Yulia Marushevska accepted a job as Deputy Head of the Odessa Regional State Administration. According to [[Mikheil Saakashvili]] Yulia Marushevska had previously spent a year of training at Harvard and Stanford universities.&lt;ref name="saakashvili"/&gt;

The '''Inbal Pinto and Avshalom Pollak Dance Company''' is an [[State of Israel|Israeli]] [[contemporary dance]] company founded by choreographer [[Inbal Pinto]] and actor [[Avshalom Pollak]], and operates in [[Tel Aviv]], Israel since 1992. Pinto and Pollak are the artistic directors of the company, and are in charge of selecting pieces to represent the company. 

==About the Company==

Since 1992, the company has brought many contemporary danceworks to the stage for all sectors of the population. The uniqueness of their creators is seen through every detail in each piece, for example in choreography, [[staging (theatre)|staging]], the selection of [[soundtracks]], [[costume design]], and prop design. The company has 12 regular [[dancers]] and actors, works and conducts shows at the [[Suzanne Dellal Center]], and is often invited to represent Israel at important [[festivals]] and leading cultural events around the globe. 

The company's first production was the piece ''A Chance for 100'', which was created by the company and Yossi Pollak-Avshalom Pollak's father.

Apart from contemporary dance performances, the company also performs [[operas]] and musicals. For example, in 2006, they performed the opera ''Armid'' by [[Christoph Willibald Gluck]] in [[Wiesbaden]], Germany, and again at the [[Israeli Opera]]. In 2013, they performed the play ''The Cat that Lived a Million Times'', based on Yoko Sano's book, in Tokyo, Japan, as well as the opera ''The Cunning Little Vixen'' by [[Leos Janacek]] at the Opera house in [[Bergen]], Norway. 

Throughout the years Pinto and Pollak cooperated with different artists, among them choreographer Robby Barnett, with whom they created the show ''Rushes'' in 2007 for the American contemporary dance company Pilobolus; the Norwegian company "Kitchen Orchestra", created the soundtracks for ''Trout'', which was performed for the first time in [[Stavanger]], Norway in 2008. Other collaborations include the cooperations with choreographer Talya Bek, who created the works ''Sodad'' in 2009 and ''Empire'' in 2010. 

In 2013, illustrators Rony Fahima and Shimrit Alkanti illustrated pictures and animations for the productions of ''The Cunning Little Vixen'' and ''Dust''. Moreover, in 2014, they joined the Japanese Musicians Omitaro Eba, Hirufomi Nakamura, and Mayu Ganto, who had created the music for the show ''Wallflower'' and that Pinto and Pollak had met during their time in Japan working on ''The Cat that Lived a Million Times''. Pinto and Pollak cooperate regularly with French lighting designer Yohan Tiboli.

[[File:YaldaZibad.jpg|thumb|Yalda Festival Iran]]
[[File:YaldaZibadGonabadChela.jpg|thumb|Yalda Festival Iran]]
'''KafBikh'''  or KafBeex in Persian(کفبیخ)is a kind of traditional sweet in [[Khorasan Province|Khorasan]] in  [[Iran]] specially in the city of [[Gonabad]]. In part of Iran there are some special classical traditions specially  for the night of [[yalda]]. during this longest night in south  Khorasan family are gathering to provide a kind of sweet called Kaf.

==Preparation==
The sweet Kaf is based on the root of [[Acanthophyllum squarrosum]] the root should be cleaned and boiled at least three times and the boiled water be discarded until the water has a good smell and good taste.
 
[[File:Acanthophyllum squarrosum.jpg|thumb|Acanthophyllum squarrosum]]

During this ceremony, the root of the plant called "Chubak", or Bikh  which is known as [[Acanthophyllum]] , is soaked in water and after several boils, they are shed in a large pot called "Tegar". Families and men, with a handful of thin pods of pomegranate trees, called the "batches"  shake of the liquid, for hours, to become rigid, and this should be done in a cool environment so that the liquid is foamed and then hardened to dry. Like Isfahan Gaz
The prepared Kaf is prepared at the end by mixing the juice or sugar, and after being decorated, the walnut and pistachio are taken to the guests. In the meantime, a group of young  are allowed to sweeten the kaf by throwing it to each other and rubbing the kaf to face of  each other adding happiness to the guests.[http://parssea.org/?p=8399]
[[File:KafBeex a kind of sweet in iran.jpg|thumb|KafBeex a kind of sweet in Iran]]
Another custom performed in certain parts of Iran and khorasan on the night of  [[yalda]] (Chelleh) involves young engaged couples. The men send an edible arrangement containing seven kinds of fruits and a variety of gifts to their fiancees on this night. In some areas, the girl and her family return the favor by sending gifts back for the young man.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=KafBikh |author=Dr.Mohammad Ajam|publisher=parssea}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Foods in iran |author=http://parssea.org/?p=8399 .|year=2011|publisher=parssea}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''[[chamber of rhetoric]]''' was a civic society for the promotion of poetry, drama and eloquence. They also maintained literary contact between different towns, partly through competitions in which chambers from other places were invited to compete, producing a shared literary culture across different jurisdictions. Growing from medieval confraternities that performed mystery plays and miracle plays for feast days and civic festivals, they were widespread in the [[Low Countries]] during the [[Renaissance literature|Renaissance]] period, with some survivals and revivals in subsequent periods down to the present day. They were often named after flowers or patron saints.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9163">The '''Sir Hugh Casson Award''' for the worst new building of the year has been awarded annually since 1982 by the 'Nooks and Corners' column of the British satirical magazine ''[[Private Eye]]''. The name ironically honours [[Hugh Casson|Sir Hugh Casson]]. Column author [[Gavin Stamp]] explained in 2015 that "he would turn up - take a fee - for giving evidence at public inquiries to recommend the demolition of buildings: a trade I despise". Stamp noted that Casson would sometimes mention his office as Vice-Chairman of [[The Victorian Society]] when arguing for the demolition of Victorian buildings. The medal of the award uses a sketch of Casson which is a [[self-portrait]].&lt;ref name="Page 94"&gt;{{cite podcast |title=Page 94: The Private Eye Podcast.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5977">The '''Lough Lene Boat''', also known as '''The Monks' Boat''', is an [[Underwater archaeology|underwater archaeological]] artifact from [[prehistoric Ireland]]. It was discovered in 1968 on the east side of  [[Lough Lene]], [[County Westmeath]] nearest to the Cummerstown/Windtown townlands of [[Collinstown]].  [[Radiocarbon dating]] revealed that the boat was constructed sometime between the [[Early history of Ireland|1st and 4th century]].&lt;ref name="askaboutireland.boat"&gt;[http://www.askaboutireland.ie/reading-room/environment-geography/physical-landscape/lakelands-of-westmeath/lough-lene/the-monks-boat/ The Monk's boat], Ask About Ireland. Retrieved 15 May 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Discovery ==
[[File:NunsTurgesius Castle isles Lough Lene.JPG|thumb|right|[[Nuns Island]], a site popularly associated with the history of the Lough Lene Boat, is visible in this photo of [[Lough Lene]] shows.  Turgesius Island and the Castle Isles are also visible.  The mainland is in the foreground.]]
The boat, which resembled a "dug out [[canoe]]", was discovered by [[Underwater diving|divers]] belonging to the local [[Mullingar]] Sub Aqua Club.  The divers moved the boat into shallower water and then, on 28 September 1958, brought it ashore for examination by [[Archaeology|experts]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.askaboutireland.ie/image_large?asset_id=7657 Photo of the Mullingar Sub Aqua Club]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Characteristics ==
P. O hEailidhe from the [[National Museum of Ireland]] reported: &lt;blockquote&gt;
"the Lough Lene boat combines techniques of [[sewn boat]] construction together with that of [[Mortise and tenon|mortise-and-tenon]] in a way which cannot be paralleled elsewhere at present."  &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.askaboutireland.ie/show_narrative_page.do?page_id=4070 P. O hEailidhe, National Museum of Ireland] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927220237/http://www.askaboutireland.ie/show_narrative_page.do?page_id=4070 |date=2007-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Legend==
"The Monks' Boat" appellation comes from a [[History of the Republic of Ireland|20th century]] [[folklore|local tradition]] that associates the boat with the [[monk]]s of the [[Ruins|ruined]] [[Fore Abbey]].  Although the boat pre-dates the [[abbey]] by several centuries, it is thought that the boat may have been sunk while moving religious artifacts used during [[Mass (liturgy)|mass]] in the Fore Abbey and on the [[convent]] on [[Nuns Island, Lough Lene|Nuns Island]].  Another [[legend]] holds that locals, believing the boat [[curse]]d with bad fortune, did not wish the boat recovered.&lt;ref name="askaboutireland.boat"/&gt;

Because of theories about a possible [[Roman Britain|Romano-British]] origin for the Lough Lene Boat, some have even speculated a connection between the vessel and [[St. Patrick]].  According to the [[Annals of Ulster]] (a [[Early Modern Ireland 1536–1691|late medieval]] document in which dates, especially of earlier events, are suspect) the [[Early Medieval Ireland 800–1166|era of St. Patrick's life]] coincides with scientific estimation of when the boat was constructed.

==The Lough Lene Bell==
[[Image:Lough Lene Bell Riplica.JPG|thumb|right|400px|Lough Lene Bell]]
In 1882, the Royal Irish Academy was presented with the Bell of [[Lough Lene]] by the Barbavila estate proprietor, Mr. William Barlow Smythe.  The bell had been discovered the previous year in Lough Lene by a boy fishing for eels on Castle Island, which was owned by Smythe at the time.

Given the close proximity to the [[Fore Abbey]], the estate owner Smythe concluded that the bell possibly belonged to the St Feichin Abbey; During the Viking and Anglo-Norman oppressions, it may have been transferred to Nun's Island, before being eventually being hidden upon Castle Island.

The [[Bell (instrument)|Bell]] has a faint outline of the Christian [[Celtic cross]] upon opposing sides of the bell and an ornamental periphiral border. Smythe pronounced that ornamentation was generally reserved for the cases or [[shrine]]s for that era and was therefore most unusual.
The bell appears similar to two other bells from that early Christian period. These had been found in [[Bangor, County Down]] in the year 1832, and  another in [[Cashel, County Tipperary]] in 1849. Smythe, the Barbavila owner, believed that the Lough Lene Bell was contemporary to these bells which were believed to be from the 7th century, therefore supporting his theory that it was possible that it could have been a relic of [[St. Feichin]]s.
The Folklore Commission also hold an account of Kit "the Blade" Fagan's discovery of the bell, which  consequentially triggered a local treasure hunt for further artifacts around [[Collinstown]] and Fore.

While the original ''Lough Lene Bell'' remains within the National Museum, a half sized replica holds a place of pride as the [[Ceann Comhairle]]'s Bell in Dáil Éireann.
This replica was presented to the Dáil in 1931 by the widow of Major [[Bryan Cooper (politician)|Bryan Cooper]], a former member of the House.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.askaboutireland.ie/reading-room/environment-geography/physical-landscape/lakelands-of-westmeath/lough-lene/the-bell-of-lough-lene/index.xml The bell of Lough Lene], Ask About Ireland.

The '''M1 Singapore Fringe Festival''' is an annual [[fringe theatre]] festival in [[Singapore]]. In additional to theatrical performances, it hosts art installations, live music, and a forum. It is organised by [[The Necessary Stage]], a non-profit theatre company. The festival occurs each January with a different theme, such as "Art and the People" (2014), "Art &amp; Loss" (2015), and "Art &amp; the Animal" (2016).

The tenth M1 Singapore Fringe Festival took place in 2014. It had a higher attendance than any previous M1 festival. It was after this festival that The Necessary Stage instituted a policy of appointing a new [[artistic director]] every two years. The company intends the two-year tenure to give each director time to realise a vision for the festival, while building relationships with artists and curators.

'''Malcolm''' "'''Mal'''" '''Reynolds''' is a [[fictional character]] and the [[protagonist]] of the [[Firefly (franchise)|''Firefly'' franchise]]. Mal is played by actor [[Nathan Fillion]] in the 2002 [[TV series]] [[Firefly (TV series)|''Firefly'']] and the 2005 film ''[[Serenity (2005 film)|Serenity]]''. In the series, Mal is a former [[Browncoat]] [[sergeant]] and the captain of the [[Serenity (Firefly vessel)|"''Firefly''-class" spaceship ''Serenity'']]. The character was named #18 in ''[[TV Guide]]''{{'s}} Greatest Sci-Fi Legends list in 2004.&lt;ref name="legend"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://whedonesque.com/comments/4511 |title=Captain Mal Reynolds features in '25 Greatest Sci-fi legends' list |website=Whedonesque.com |date=July 27, 2004 |author=Simon |accessdate=July 16, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production details==
Conceived by [[Joss Whedon]], the character Malcolm Reynolds was the only definite character he had in mind when formulating the ensemble cast. He wanted a hero, but not a hero in the classic sense; someone that is "everything that a hero is not."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2010/03/the-10-greatest-anti-heroes-5-malcolm-reynolds.html |title=The 10 Greatest Anti-Heroes: #5 Malcolm Reynolds |magazine=[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]] |date=March 17, 2010 |accessdate=October 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the proposed pilot, Mal was much darker and considerably more closed-off. Fox network executives objected, and asked that Mal be "lightened up". For the second episode ("[[The Train Job]]"), Whedon created a more "jolly" Mal Reynolds.&lt;ref&gt;Whedon, ''Train Job: Director's Commentary,'' Track 1&lt;/ref&gt;

Fillion shares his view on the motivations of the character he portrayed. Mal has lost so much that each character in the crew he has gathered on ''Serenity'' represents an aspect of himself he no longer has. "In Wash, he has a lust for life and a sense of humor he's lost. In Jayne, he has selfishness. In Book, he has spirituality. In Kaylee, he has innocence. Everybody represents a facet of himself that he has lost and that's why he keeps them close and safe, and yet at arm's length."&lt;ref name="FFC26"/&gt;

===Casting===
The role was originally written for ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'' co-star [[Nicholas Brendon]] (who played [[Xander Harris]]);&lt;ref&gt;Q&amp;A with Nicholas Brendan&amp;nbsp;— Supanova Convention in Sydney, Australia - 13 October 2007, also Q&amp;A with Nicholas Brendan - Armageddon Expo in Melbourne, Australia - 23 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=April 2018}} however, the shooting schedule conflicted with his commitment to ''Buffy''.

Whedon approached Nathan Fillion to play the lead, and after explaining the premise and showing Fillion the treatment for the pilot, Fillion was eager for the role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.whedon.info/article.php3?id_article=1531&amp;img= |title=Interview with Nathan Fillion&amp;nbsp;— Dreamwatch Magazine 107 |website=Whedon.info |date=September 9, 2003 |accessdate=July 11, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fillion was called back several times to read for the part before he was cast. He noted that "It was really thrilling. It was my first lead and I was pretty nervous, but I really wanted that part and I wanted to tell those stories."&lt;ref name="FFC26"&gt;Whedon, ''Firefly Companion, Vol 1'', p.26.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Costume design===
Los Angeles prop shop Applied Effects was approached by Randy Erikson to create Mal's main gun, a "Moses Brothers Self-Defense Engine Frontier Model B",&lt;ref name="scifi"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.scifi.com/sfw/cool/sfw17440.html |title=Official Malcolm Reynolds Stunt Pistol |first=Sean |last=Huxter |website=[[Scifi.com]] |date=October 15, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071130182729/http://www.scifi.com/sfw/cool/sfw17440.html |archivedate=November 30, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and gave them a week and a half. Erikson provided a foamcore conceptual mockup and the base guns, one of which was a five-shot .38 [[caliber]] [[Taurus Model 85]] revolver. Erikson researched [[American Civil War]]-era revolvers for inspiration and the final mockup had a brass or bronze look, with the revolver a little elongated. The biggest challenge was masking the shape of the original revolver and still keeping it operable.&lt;ref&gt;Whedon, ''Firefly Companion, Vol 1'', pp.79-80.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the TV series ''Firefly'', a cast [[bronze]] pistol was used, but for the film ''Serenity'', a more detailed replica was created which had moving [[firearm action|action]] and a [[Blank (cartridge)#Applications|blank pistol]] hidden inside, so that it could be fired in [[close-up]]s. Since this version was quite heavy, a [[resin]] replica was also constructed, which in addition to being less tiring for the actors to carry, could be thrown or dropped with less fear of injury.&lt;ref name="quant"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.quantummechanix.com/IN%20THE%20WORKS/4C9CB708-01B9-4E9F-A5F7-3FCE0DED9598.html |title=The Metal Mal Hero Pistol Replica |website=Quantummechanix.com |date=September 30, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071210062342/http://www.quantummechanix.com/IN%20THE%20WORKS/4C9CB708-01B9-4E9F-A5F7-3FCE0DED9598.html |archivedate=December 10, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonfunctional replicas of the gun are commercially available for [[fan (person)|fans]] and [[Collecting|collectors]].&lt;ref name="scifi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="quant"/&gt;

GBB Custom Gunleather was tasked with creating Mal's gun holster, which was made out of oak-tanned carving leather.&lt;ref&gt;Whedon, ''Firefly Companion, Vol 1'', p.81.&lt;/ref&gt; The character's coat, a relic of his time as a [[Browncoat]], was a collaboration between Firefly costume designer [[Shawna Trpcic]] and Jonathan A. Logan, a leather artist. Trpcic sketched her idea and a cloth mockup was created before the final was made with domestic-farmed deerskin. The cuffs are actually the sleeves folded back, evoking the style of Oriental robes with their silk linings. Two coats were made for the character, one called "Number 1" coat and another called "The Hero" coat. The Number 1 coat's bullet hole is drawn in, while The Hero version has a detailed cut and sewn repair.&lt;ref&gt;Whedon, ''Firefly Companion, Vol 1'', p.83.&lt;/ref&gt; As with the gun, replicas of Malcolm Reynolds' coat have also been made available commercially for fans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://abbyshot.blogspot.com/2009/11/browncoat-launched-aim-to-misbehave.html  |title=The Malcolm Reynolds Browncoat Replica |website=AbbyShot Blog |date=November 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Character biography==
Malcolm's main mission is to keep his crew alive and to keep his ship flying. As ''Firefly'' writer Tim Minear stated in an interview: "It's just about getting by. That's always been the mission statement of what the show is&amp;nbsp;— getting by."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Mal was raised by his mother and "about 40 hands" on a ranch on the planet Shadow.&lt;ref&gt;Whedon, ''Firefly: the complete series: "Our Mrs. Reynolds"''&lt;/ref&gt; Though Mal usually seems more practical than intellectual, he occasionally surprises his friends by displaying familiarity with disparate literature varying from the works of [[Xiang Yu]]&lt;ref&gt;Whedon, ''Firefly: the complete series: "War Stories"''&lt;/ref&gt; to [[The Rime of the Ancient Mariner|poems]]&lt;ref name="Whedon, Serenity, DVD"/&gt; by [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]], though he has no idea "who" [[Mona Lisa]] is.

Mal volunteered for the [[Browncoat|Independents]] army during the Unification War against the [[Alliance (Firefly)|Alliance]], gaining the rank of sergeant during that time. His loyal second-in-command [[Zoe Washburne|Zoe]] was by his side for most of the war, surviving many dangerous conflicts with him. The show mentions three such battles, including the Battle of Du-Khang in 2510 (featured in "[[The Message (Firefly)|The Message]]") and a long winter campaign in New Kashmir (as told by Zoe in "[[War Stories (Firefly episode)|War Stories]]") where he commanded a platoon. Mal was also involved in the ground campaign during the Battle of Sturges (as seen in the comic book ''[[Serenity: Those Left Behind]]''), which according to [[List of minor characters in Firefly#Badger|Badger]] was the "bloodiest and shortest battle in all the war", although Mal considers it a distant second. Mal fought in many more battles, but the turning point for him and the Independents came with their physical and emotional defeat at the ''Battle of Serenity Valley'' on the planet [[List of Firefly planets and moons#Hera|Hera]]. On-screen information in ''Serenity'' shows him to have been attached to the 57th Overlanders Brigade; in the series pilot, Badger calls it the "Balls and Bayonets Brigade", though it is unclear whether this was a disparaging nickname coined by Badger himself or the actual unit [[sobriquet]] (A deleted scene in ''Serenity'' marks it as the actual unit nickname.  It is unknown if the deleted scene can be considered canon or not.)

After the war, Mal acquired his own ship, a derelict 03-K64 ''Firefly''-class transport. Mal named the ship ''Serenity'' after the Battle of Serenity Valley, the decisive battle of the Unification War.

==Reception==
Fillion won the "Cinescape Genre Face of the Future Award&amp;nbsp;— Male" award by the Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy &amp; Horror Films, USA for his role as Malcolm Reynolds. Fillion also won the [[SyFy Genre Awards]] in 2006 for ''Best Actor/Television'' and was runner-up for ''Best Actor/Movie''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://syfyportal.com/news.php?id=2895 |title=SyfyPortal Awards |accessdate=October 8, 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061107100529/http://www.syfyportal.com/news.php?id=2895 |archivedate=November 7, 2006 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The character was named #18 in ''[[TV Guide]]''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s "Greatest Sci-fi legends" list in 2004.&lt;ref name="legend" /&gt; In 2008, ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]'' ranked Mal as #34 on their list of the 100 Greatest Movie Characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://www.empireonline.com/100-greatest-movie-characters/default.asp?c=51 |title=The 100 Greatest Movie Characters |magazine=Empire |accessdate=June 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, ''[[SFX (magazine)|SFX Magazine]]'' voted Mal Reynolds #1 on their Top 100 Sci-Fi icons of the century.

In her review of the film ''Serenity'' for ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[Manohla Dargis]] had this to say about the character and Nathan Fillion: "Mal is no [[Neo (The Matrix)|Neo]] redux; he's closer to [[Indiana Jones]], if absent [[Harrison Ford]]'s rakishly handsome looks and star magnetism. Like the rest of the cast, Mr. Fillion is a charming performer, but he borrows rather than owns the screen, which dovetails with Mr. Whedon's modest aspirations for this film."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Dargis |first=Manohla |date=September 30, 2005 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/30/movies/scruffy-space-cowboys-fighting-their-failings.html |title=Scruffy Space Cowboys Fighting Their Failings |newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mao Samnang''' is a Cambodian author who has written stories for films such as ''[[The Weird Villa]]'', ''[[The Snake King's Child]]'' and ''[[The Haunted House (2005 film)|The Haunted House]]''. She is considered to be one of the country's most popular authors.&lt;ref&gt;''Modern Short Fiction of Southeast Asia: A Literary History'', Teri Shaffer Yamada - [https://books.google.com/books?id=1j8LAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22Mao+Samnang%22&amp;dq=%22Mao+Samnang%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjSm7f8vo_SAhUGmpQKHVGABaAQ6AEIKTAD Page 125]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Le Cambodge'', By Soizick Crochet - [https://books.google.com/books?id=EAAznFz3OoMC&amp;pg=PA243&amp;dq=%22Mao+Samnang%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjSm7f8vo_SAhUGmpQKHVGABaAQ6AEIHjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Mao%20Samnang%22&amp;f=false Page 243]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Samnang started her writing around 1981. By 2016 she had more than 100 of her novels published. According to her, many of her novels have a message in them. The messages were aimed at the youth to remind or educate them about what comes of drug use.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Khmer Times]]'', Wednesday, 27 July 2016 - [http://www.khmertimeskh.com/news/27714/khmer-novels-endangered-as-readership-dries-up/ Khmer Novels Endangered as Readership Dries Up - Va Sonyka]&lt;/ref&gt;  Around 2009, she was earning around US$500 for each novel which took about a month to write.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Phnom Penh Post]]'', Mon, 18 May 2009 - [http://www.phnompenhpost.com/lifestyle/reading-novel-obsession-among-cambodian-youth Reading: a novel obsession among Cambodian youth - Lim Seang Heng]&lt;/ref&gt; As a screenwriter, the films she has scripted for are seen regularly around [[Phnom Penh]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Cambodia Daily]]'', June 26, 2003 - [https://www.cambodiadaily.com/archives/some-screenwriters-claim-govt-censorship-30006/ Some Screenwriters Claim Gov’t Censorship by Thet Sambath]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Film==
One of her stories put to film was Snaker, released in 2001. It was Directed by Fai Sam Ang and starred Winai Kraibutr, Pich Chanbormey, Tep Rindaro, and Om Portevy.&lt;ref&gt;[[Letterboxd]] - [https://letterboxd.com/film/snaker/crew/ Snaker 2001 ‘งูเก็งกอง’ Directed by Fai Sam Ang, Crew]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Letterboxd - [https://letterboxd.com/film/snaker/ Snaker 2001 ‘งูเก็งกอง’ Directed by Fai Sam Ang, Cast]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later years==
Samnang Samnang  stopped writing around 2014. This was due to her not being able to get a publishing deal that would allow her to write for Khmer readers. Another reason was because of problems with copyright violations.&lt;ref&gt;''Khmer Times'', Wednesday, 27 July 2016 - [http://www.khmertimeskh.com/news/27714/khmer-novels-endangered-as-readership-dries-up/ Khmer Novels Endangered as Readership Dries Up - Va Sonyka]&lt;/ref&gt;

These edifices marked the burial sites of many eminent Egyptians during Egypt's [[Early Dynastic Period (Egypt)|Early Dynastic Period]] and [[Old Kingdom of Egypt|Old Kingdom]]. In the Old Kingdom epoch, local kings began to be buried in [[Egyptian pyramids|pyramids]] instead of in mastabas, although non-royal use of mastabas continued for over a thousand years. Egyptologists call these tombs ''mastaba'', from the Arabic word {{lang|ar|مسطبة}} "stone bench".&lt;ref name="Bench"&gt;{{cite web|title=Mastaba Tomb of Perneb|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/543937|website=Met Museum|access-date=22 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[afterlife]] became a main focus of Egyptian civilization and ruled every aspect of the society.{{citation needed|date= March 2016}} This is reflected in Egyptian architecture and most prominently by the enormous amounts of time, money, and manpower involved in the building of tombs.&lt;ref name="Hamlin"&gt;{{cite book |last= Hamlin |first= Talbot |title= Architecture through the Ages |location= New York |publisher= Putnam |year= 1954 |page= 30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ancient Egyptians believed the soul could live only if the body was preserved from corruption and depredation as well as fed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Badawy |first= Alexander |title= Architecture in Ancient Egypt and the Near East |location= Cambridge |publisher= MIT Press |year= 1966 |page= 46 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in the [[Prehistoric Egypt|Predynastic]] era and continuing into the later dynasties, the ancient Egyptians developed increasingly complex and effective methods for preserving and protecting the bodies of the dead. The ancient Egyptians initially buried their dead in pit graves dug out from the sand. The body of the deceased was buried inside the pit on a mat, usually along with some items believed to help them in the afterlife. The first tomb structure that the Egyptians built was the mastaba. Mastabas provided better protection from scavenging animals and from grave robbers. However, the human remains were not in contact with the dry desert sand, so natural mummification could not take place. Use of the more secure mastabas required Ancient Egyptians to devise a system of artificial mummification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Ancient Egypt and the Near East |location= Cambridge |publisher= MIT Press |year= 1966 |page= 7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Until at least the Old Period or First Intermediate Period, only high officials and royalty would be buried in these mastabas.&lt;ref&gt;

==Structure==
[[File:Mastaba schematics.svg|right|thumb|Structure of a mastaba]]
The word 'mastaba' comes from the [[Arabic]] word for a bench of mud,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Alan Gardiner |last=Gardiner |first=A. |year=1964 |title=Egypt of the Pharahos |page=57 n7 |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press }}&lt;/ref&gt; and when seen from a distance a mastaba does resemble a bench. Historians speculate that the Egyptians may have borrowed architectural ideas from Mesopotamia since at the time they were both building similar structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gascone|first=Bamber|title=History of architecture|url=http://www.historyworld.net/wrldhis/PlainTextHistories.asp?ParagraphID=arb|publisher=History of the world|accessdate=29 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The above-ground structure of a mastaba is rectangular in shape with inward-sloping sides and a flat roof. The exterior building materials were initially bricks made of sun dried mud, which was readily available from the Nile River. Even after more durable materials like stone came into use, all but the most important monumental structures were built from the easily available mud bricks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=R. |first=C. L. |title=A Model of the Mastaba-Tomb of Userkaf-Ankh |journal=Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin |volume=8 |year=1913 |issue=6 |pages=125–130 |jstor=3252928 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mastabas were often about four times as long as they were wide, and many rose to at least 30 feet in height. The mastaba was built with a north-south orientation, which the Ancient Egyptians believed was essential for access to the afterlife. This above-ground structure had space for a small offering chapel equipped with a false door. Priests and family members brought food and other offerings for the soul, or ''[[Ba (Egyptian soul)|ba]]'', of the deceased because Egyptians believed that the soul had to be maintained in order to continue to exist in the afterlife.

Inside the mastaba, a deep chamber was dug into the ground and lined with stone and bricks. The burial chambers were cut deep, until they passed the bedrock, and were lined with wood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=BBC|title=Mastabas|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ancient/egyptians/pyramid_gallery_02.shtml|publisher=bbc|accessdate=29 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A second hidden chamber called a "serdab" (سرداب), from the Persian word for "cellar",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Bard | first = K. A. | title = Encyclopedia of the Archaeology of Ancient Egypt | publisher = Routledge | location = New York | year = 1999 |isbn=978-0415185899}}&lt;/ref&gt; was used to store anything that may have been considered essential for the comfort of the deceased in the afterlife, such as beer, cereal, grain, clothes, and precious items.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lewis|first=Ralph|title=Burial practices, and Mummies|url=http://www.egyptianmuseum.org/burialpracticesgallery|publisher=Rosicrucian Museum|accessdate=29 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mastaba housed a statue of the deceased that was hidden within the masonry for its protection. High up the walls of the serdab were small openings that would allow the ''ba'' to leave and return to the body (represented by the statue); Ancient Egyptians believed the ''ba'' had to return to its body or it would die.  These openings "were not meant for viewing the statue but rather for allowing the fragrance of burning incense, and possibly the spells spoken in rituals, to reach the statue".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Arnold |first=Dorothea |title=When the Pyramids were Built: Egyptian Art of the Old Kingdom |location=New York |publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art |year=1999 |page=12 |isbn=978-0870999086 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architectural evolution==
[[File:Giza pyramid complex (map).svg|right|thumb|Map of the [[Giza Plateau]], showing the mastabas constructed within the complex]]
The mastaba was the standard type of tomb in pre-dynastic and early dynastic Egypt for both the [[pharaoh]] and the social elite. The ancient  city of [[Abydos, Egypt|Abydos]] was the location chosen for many of the [[cenotaph]]s. The royal cemetery was at [[Saqqara]], overlooking the capital of early times, [[memphis, Egypt|Memphis]].&lt;ref name="Fletcher"&gt;{{cite book |last=Fletcher |first=Banister |year=1996 |title=A History of Architecture |edition=20th |location=Oxford |publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann |isbn=978-0750622677 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mastabas evolved over the early dynastic period. During the [[1st Dynasty]], a mastaba was constructed simulating house plans of several rooms, a central one containing the sarcophagus and others surrounding it to receive the abundant funerary offerings. The whole was built in a shallow pit above which a brick superstructure covering a broad area. The typical [[2nd Dynasty|2nd]] and [[3rd Dynasty]] mastabas was the 'stairway mastaba', the tomb chamber of which sank deeper than before and was connected to the top with an inclined shaft and stairs.&lt;ref name="Fletcher"/&gt;

Even after pharaohs began to construct pyramids for their tombs in the 3rd Dynasty, members of the nobility continued to be buried in mastaba tombs. This is especially evident on the [[Giza Plateau]], where at least 150 mastaba tombs have been constructed alongside the pyramids.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Davis|first=Ben|date=1997|title=THE FUTURE OF THE PAST|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/24995879|journal=Scientific American|volume=277|issue=2|pages=89–92}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[4th Dynasty]] (c. 2613 to 2494 BC), [[rock-cut tombs]] began to appear. These were tombs built into the rock cliffs in [[Upper Egypt]] in an attempt to further thwart grave robbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=R. |first=L. E. |title=Two Mastaba Chambers |journal=Museum of Fine Arts Bulletin |volume=8 |issue=45 |year=1910 |pages=19–20 |jstor=4423469 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mastabas, then, were developed with the addition of offering chapels and vertical shafts. [[5th Dynasty]] mastabas had elaborate chapels consisting of several rooms, columned halls and '[[serdab]]'. The actual tomb chamber was built below the south-end of mastaba, connected by a slanting passage to a stairway emerging in the center of a columned hall or court.

Mastabas are still well attested in the Middle Kingdom. Here they had a revival. They were often solid structures with the decoration only on the outside.&lt;ref&gt;Arnold, D. (2008): ''Middle Kingdom Tomb Architecture at Lisht'', Egyptian Expedition XXVIII, Metropolitan Museum of Art: New York {{ISBN|9781588391940}}, S. 26-30&lt;/ref&gt; 

By the time of the [[New Kingdom]] (which began with the [[18th Dynasty]] around 1550 BC), "the mastaba becomes rare, being largely superseded by the independent pyramid chapel above a burial chamber".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Badawy |first=Alexander |title=Architecture in Ancient Egypt and the Near East |location=Cambridge |publisher=MIT Press |year=1966 |page=51 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8813">The '''Militant League for German Culture''' (German: ''Kampfbund für deutsche Kultur'', ''KfdK''), was a nationalistic anti-Semitic political society during the [[Weimar Republic]] and the [[Nazi]] era. It was founded in 1928 as the ''Nationalsozialistische Gesellschaft für deutsche Kultur'' (NGDK, National Socialist Society for German Culture') by Nazi ideologue [[Alfred Rosenberg]] and remained under his leadership until it was reorganized and renamed to the National Socialist Culture Community (''Nationalsozialistische Kulturgemeinde'') in 1934. Its aim was to make a significant imprint on cultural life in Germany that was based on the aims and objectives of the inner circles of the Nazi Party. Upon its reorganization, it was merged with the ''Deutsche Bühne'' (German Stage), connected with the establishment of the official body for cultural surveillance, the "Dienstelle Rosenberg" (DRbg) and was later known as the [[Amt Rosenberg]].

==Members and followers==
The number of members, who were organized in local chapters, rose from approximately 300 in 25 chapters in April 1929 to about 38,000 in 450 chapters by October 1933. 

The members and supporters included representatives of the extreme right wing of the National Socialist movement. These included anti-Semitic literary historians [[Adolf Bartels]], Ludwig Polland, [[Gustaf Kossinna]], physicist and [[Einstein]]-opponent [[Philipp Lenard]], publishers [[Hugo Bruckmann]] and [[Julius Friedrich Lehmann]], the leaders of the Bayreuth Society [[Winifred Wagner]], Daniela Thode, [[Hans Freiherr von Wolzogen]], the widow of racial ideologist [[Houston Stewart Chamberlain]], Eva Chamberlain, the composer [[Paul Graener]], the philosophers [[Otto Friedrich Bollnow]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kant.uni-mainz.de/ks/history/leaman.html Die Kant-Studien im Dritten Reich], George Leaman, Bowling Green / Gerd Simon, Tübingen&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Eugen Herrigel]],&lt;ref&gt;Die Nazifizierung der Philosophie an der Universität Breslau 1933-1945, von Norbert Kapferer, LIT Verlag, 2002, {{ISBN|3825854515}}&lt;/ref&gt; the poet and later president of the ''Reichsschrifttumskammer'' [[Hanns Johst]]; the architect Paul Schulze-Naumburg, who edited the periodical ''Kunst und Rasse'' [''Art and Race''], and who spoke at many events; Gustav Havemann, a violinist and later leader of the Reichsmusikkammer (who founded and lead a Kampfbund orchestra); the theater director Karl von Schirach; Fritz Kloppe who led ''[[Werwolf]]'', a paramilitary organization; and the theologian and nationalist musicologist [[Fritz Stein]]. [[Othmar Spann]], Austrian political philosopher and a teacher of [[Friedrich Hayek]]. After an ad on April 20, 1933, Edwin Werner, PhD, founded his own association in Passau.&lt;ref&gt;Anna Rosmus: Hitlers Nibelungen, Samples Grafenau 2015, pp. 61f&lt;/ref&gt; 

Corporate and organizational members included the Association of German Fraternities [Deutsche Burschenschaften], the German Homeland Association [Deutsche Landsmannschaft], German College Gymnastics Associations [Turnerschaften an deutschen Hochschulen], the Association of German Guilds [Deutsche Gildenschaften], the Association of German Glee Clubs [Deutsche Sängerschaft], the German College Music Society [Sondershäuser Verband], and German College Art Society [Deutscher Hochschulring].

==Publications and political action ==
[[File:Nuremberg Trials defendant Wilhelm Frick in his cell 1945.jpeg|thumb|Frick in his cell, November 1945]]
The Society published the periodical ''Mitteilung des Kampfbundes für deutsche Kultur'' [''Proceedings of the KfdK''] from 1929 to 1931. Under the heading "Signs of the Times" they listed their enemies: [[Erich Kästner]], [[Kurt Tucholsky]], [[Thomas Mann]], [[Bertolt Brecht]], [[Walter Mehring]], and the Berlin Institute for Sexual Research. Later the most frequently mentioned were [[Paul Klee]], [[Wassily Kandinsky|Kandinsky]], [[Kurt Schwitters]], the [[Bauhaus|Bauhaus Movement]], [[Emil Nolde]], Karl Hofter, [[Max Beckmann]], and [[Georg Grosz]]. Books by [[Ernst Toller]], [[Arnold Zweig]], [[Jakob Wassermann]], [[Lion Feuchtwanger]], [[Arnolt Bronnen]], [[Leonhard Frank]], [[Emil Ludwig]], and [[Alfred Neumann (writer)|Alfred Neumann]] were dismissed as not properly German. In 1930, the society directed a campaign against [[Ernst Barlach]] and the so-called "hate art" (''Hetzkunst'') of [[Käthe Kollwitz]].

The Society published ''German Culture Watch: Journal of the KfdK'' in October 1932, reprinted in 1933, under the editorship of [[Hans Hinkel]].

Their activities had a nationwide impact. In 1930 [[Wilhelm Frick]], the Nazi Interior and Cultural minister of Thuringia and KdfK regional leader, named [[Hans Severus Ziegler]] of the Schultze-Naumburg firm as director of the Weimar Architecture Institute. He immediately dismissed all practitioners of the Bauhaus style. Frick ordered artworks by "[[degenerate art]]ists" to be removed from the [[Schlossmuseum, Weimar|Schlossmuseum in Weimar]]. These included works by [[Otto Dix]], [[Lyonel Feininger]], [[Wassily Kandinsky|Kandinsky]], [[Paul Klee]], Barlack, [[Oskar Kokoschka]], [[Franz Marc]], and [[Emil Nolde]], although the latter was himself a nazi. Works by modernist composers [[Stravinsky]] and [[Hindemith]] were struck from state-subsidized concert programs, and books by [[Erich Maria Remarque]], and films by [[Sergei Eisenstein|Eisenstein]], [[Pudovkin]], and [[Georg Wilhelm Pabst]] were banned outright.

The KfdK, under Frick's auspices, arranged its first major youth conference on [[Pentecost]] in 1930. It presented Nazi leaders [[Baldur von Schirach]], [[Goebbels]], [[Hermann Göring|Göring]], and [[Walther Darré|Darré]]. Referencing Weimar's "spiritual heroes" a resolution called for "strengthening German military will" and, in reference to the arts, "resistance against all populist harmful influences in the area of theater, literature and fine arts, and against alien architecture." The following Pentecost in 1931, saw a youth and cultural meeting in Potsdam, where Rosenberg gave a lectures on "Blood and Honor," and "Race and Personality" and Göring on the theme "Readiness to fight to protect our culture."

'''Pertti Kurikan Nimipäivät''' ('''PKN''', {{Langnf||Finnish|"Pertti Kurikka's [[name day]]s"}}) were a [[Finland|Finnish]] [[punk rock]] band, formed in 2009 in a charity workshop for adults with [[developmental disabilities]]. They are the main focus of the Finnish documentary film ''[[The Punk Syndrome]]''. In 2015, they qualified for the finals of [[Uuden Musiikin Kilpailu 2015|Uuden Musiikin Kilpailu]], which they later won; they represented Finland in the Eurovision Song Contest 2015 but got knocked out in the semi-final. The band disbanded in December 2016 when guitarist Pertti Kurikka turned 60 years old and retired from playing punk rock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hs.fi/kulttuuri/art-2000005022200.html|title=Pertti Kurikan Nimipäivien viimeisellä keikalla Tapaninpäivänä oli hikistä, ahdasta ja tunteikasta eli aivan mahtavaa|date=27 December 2016|publisher=|accessdate=5 October 2017|language=fi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Formation (2004-2012)===
Pertti Kurikan Nimipäivät began in a workshop run by Lyhty, a charity for adults with developmental disabilities. In 2004, Pertti Kurikka, the future guitarist of the band, met organizer Kalle Pajamaa of Lyhty.&lt;ref name="Tolonen2013"&gt;{{cite web| title = Never mind the mall punks, here’s Pertti Kurikan Nimipäivät!| author = Arttu Tolonen| work =Finnish Music Quarterly |date=June 2013| accessdate = 6 March 2015| url = http://www.fmq.fi/2013/06/never-mind-the-mall-punks-heres-pertti-kurikan-nimipaivat/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pajamaa, who remains manager of the band today, noticed Kurikka's potential and sought to establish a band based upon him.&lt;ref name="Nyt2015a"&gt;{{cite web| title = Nytpedia: Tällainen yhtye on Pertti Kurikan nimipäivät|trans-title=Nytpedia: This is what the band Pertti Kurikan nimipäivät is like| work =Nyt| date = 2 March 2015| accessdate = 6 March 2015| url = http://nyt.fi/a1305932608636| language = Finnish}}&lt;/ref&gt; They worked on the band's formation over the next five years,&lt;ref name="Tolonen2013"/&gt; and in 2009 the band made its debut.&lt;ref name="Nyt2015a"/&gt;

In 2009, Finnish director [[Pekka Karjalainen]] sought music performed by people with disabilities for the film ''[[Vähän kunnioitusta]]'',&lt;ref name="Nyt2015b"&gt;{{cite web| title = The Story of PKN, the Finnish punk sensation ready to rock Eurovision| work = Nyt| date = 3 March 2015| accessdate = 6 March 2015| url = http://nyt.fi/a1305933792584}}&lt;/ref&gt; which tells the story of a young girl with a [[learning disability]] aspiring to live an independent and normal life.&lt;ref name="Tolonen2013"/&gt; Pertti Kurikan Nimipäivät is featured in the film with their first-ever [[Demo (music)|demo]]: "Kallioon!".&lt;ref name="Tolonen2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mäenpää2015"&gt;{{cite web| title = Pertti Kurikan Nimipäivät osallistuu Uuden Musiikin Kilpailuun| author = Arto Mäenpää| work =KaaosZine| date = 13 January 2015| accessdate = 6 March 2015| url = http://kaaoszine.fi/pertti-kurikan-nimipaivat-osallistuu-uuden-musiikin-kilpailuun/|trans-title=Pertti Kurikan Nimipäivät takes part in Uuden Musiikin Kilpailu|language=Finnish}}&lt;/ref&gt; The song became a hit, and the band soon discovered that they had a following outside the circle of disabled people.&lt;ref name="Nyt2015b"/&gt;

In 2012, their fame grew as they were the main subject of ''[[The Punk Syndrome]]'', a Finnish documentary film. The documentary, depicting the band's story from its outset to their first European tour, earned them a following in Scandinavia and Germany.&lt;ref name="Hay2015"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hay|first1=Mark|title=A Finnish Punk Band with Learning Disabilities Is Going to Eurovision|url=https://www.vice.com/read/a-finnish-punk-band-with-learning-disabilities-is-going-to-eurovision-189|website=VICE|accessdate=4 March 2015|date=3 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2014: Charity concert with Mr. Lordi===
In 2014, the band performed in a charity concert with [[Mr. Lordi]] of the Finnish rock band, [[Lordi]].

'''''Public Sale''''' is a 1943 painting by the American artist [[Andrew Wyeth]]. It shows two men by a car and in the distance a crowd of people outside a farm building. The event depicted is the forced auction of a farm after the farmer's wife had died.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.philamuseum.org/exhibitions/2006/93.html?page=2|title=Andrew Wyeth: Memory and Magic|publisher=[[Philadelphia Museum of Art]]|accessdate=July 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting belongs to the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]] since 2000. As of 2016, it is currently not on view.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.philamuseum.org/collections/permanent/93576.html|title=Public Sale|publisher=[[Philadelphia Museum of Art]]|accessdate=July 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
[[Ken Johnson (art critic)|Ken Johnson]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' singled the painting out as unusual in Wyeth's oeuvre because it "evinces social consciousness", something that otherwise is absent from the artist's works and makes him different from his contemporary [[Norman Rockwell]]. Johnson, reviewing a Wyeth exhibition in 2006, likened ''Public Sale'' to "an understated [[Thomas Hart Benton (painter)|Thomas Hart Benton]] painting".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Johnson|first=Ken|date=April 18, 2006|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/18/arts/design/18wyet.html|title='Andrew Wyeth: Memory and Magic' at the Philadelphia Museum of Art|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=July 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sara Gómez''' aka '''Sarita Gómez''' (November 8, 1942 &amp;ndash; June 2, 1974) was a [[Cuba|Cuban]] filmmaker. As a member of [[Instituto Cubano del Arte e Industria Cinematográficos|ICAIC]] during its early years, she was one of only two black filmmakers in attendance. She was the institute's first and for her lifetime Cuba's only, woman director. Gómez is known for her first and final feature length film ''[[De Cierta Manera]]'' (1974) and as, "a revolutionary filmmaker with intersecting concerns about the [[Afro-Cuban]] community and the value of its cultural traditions, women's issues, and the treatment of the marginalized sectors of society."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.films.com/id/111618|title=Sara Gomez: An Afro-Cuban Filmmaker|website=Films Media Group|language=en|access-date=2018-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life and Education ==
Brought up in a middle-class black family in Havana, she studied music (piano), literature, and Afro-Cuban ethnography. She worked as a journalist on the youth publication Mella before joining the newly-formed [[Instituto Cubano del Arte e Industria Cinematográficos]] (ICAIC) in 1961, where she subsequently served as assistant director to Jorge Fraga and [[Tomás Gutiérrez Alea]], as well as to the visiting French director [[Agnès Varda]]. Gómez made a series of documentary shorts on assigned topics before directing her first feature.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ebrahim|first=Haseenah|date=Winter 1998|title=Afrocuban Religions in Sara Gomez's One Way or Another and Gloria Rolando's Oggun|url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=a9h&amp;AN=1600688&amp;site=ehost-live.|journal=Western Journal of Black Studies|volume=no.4|pages=239-251|via=Ebscohost}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career - Contribution to Cuban Cinema==
Sara Gómez's last film, the hybrid narrative/documentary ''De cierta manera'', (translated for US audiences as ''One Way or Another)'' has been hailed as the "first movie to truly explore conflicting threads of racial and gender identity within a revolutionary context."&lt;ref&gt;Andrea Easley Morris, ''Afro-Cuban Identity in Postrevolutionary Novel and Film: Inclusion, Loss, and Cultural Resistance'' (Lanham: Bucknell University Press, 2012), p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Gómez died before the film could be completed and so [[Tomás Gutiérrez Alea]], Rigoberto Lopez, and [[Julio García Espinosa]] supervised the sound-mix and post-production stages of preparing "One way or Another" for theatrical release.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Julia Lesage. ''One Way or Another: dialectical, revolutionary, feminist''. from Jump Cut, no. 20, may 1978; Jump Cut, No. 57, Fall 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Noted Cuban film scholar Michael Chanan observes that the film is "an aesthetically radical film...mix[ing]...fiction and documentary, in the most original way...by using real people to play themselves alongside professional actors."&lt;ref&gt;Michael Chanan, ''The Cuban Image'' (London: BFI Publishing, 1985), pp. 284–85.&lt;/ref&gt; Haseenah Ebrahim writes about how Gómez's work brings attention to religious groups such as the [[Abakuá]], "Afrocuban religions make an appearance in the films and videos of almost all Afrocuban filmmakers, and feature prominently in the work of Gómez..." and highlights the importance of Sara Gómez's background as a black Cuban woman in cinema by noting, "In the case of both Gómez and [[Gloria Rolando|Rolando]], race has functioned to provide a perspective that is not mirrored in the work of non-black Cuban filmmakers. Significantly, both women self-identified themselves as black Cubans: Sara Gómez has been quoted as saying she did not want to be 'just another middle-class black woman who plays the piano'".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Essayist Roberto Zurbano Torres states, "it is also essential to mark her commitment to popular culture and her critical and self-critical passion through which she expressed the complexity of a world under construction: contributing a cinema of conscience, pointing out the virtues and defects of a social process that tried to change the world from an island in the Caribbean."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hgfilmfest.com/single-post/2018/10/12/SARA-GOMEZ-A-BLACK-FILMMAKER-ABLE-TO-ACHIEVE-THE-MYSTERY-AND-SILENCE-OF-THE-TRUE-CLASSICS|title=SARA GOMEZ: A BLACK FILMMAKER ABLE TO ACHIEVE THE MYSTERY AND SILENCE OF THE TRUE CLASSICS {{!}} Havana Glasgow Film Festival|website=Havana Glasgow Film Festival|language=en|access-date=2018-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

== As a Subject ==

=== Salut les Cubains ===
At the end of Agnès Varda's short documentary [[:fr:Salut_les_Cubains|''Salut les Cubains'']] (1963), Sara Gómez is featured as a young filmmaker dancing [[Cha-cha-cha (dance)|Cha-cha-cha]] with her fellow ICAIC filmmakers (illustrated through photographic animation.) Agnès Varda describes Gómez in the documentary as one who, "directs didactic films."&lt;ref&gt;Agnes Varda. Salut les Cubains (1963) France, Film.&lt;/ref&gt;Throughout the production of this film, "She [Gómez] had the opportunity to accompany the prestigious gala director Agnès Varda in her tour of our country and collaborate with her in the documentary"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cubacine.cult.cu/sitios/realizad/sarag.html|title=Sara Gomez|last=|first=|date=|website=cubacine.cult.cu|others=auto-translation from Spanish using Google Translate|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Sara Gómez: An Afro-Cuban Filmmaker'' ===
A few decades after Gómez's time, The Swiss filmmaker Alessandra Muller directs the documentary film: ''Sara Gómez: An Afro-Cuban Filmmaker'' (2004), supported both by ICAIC and Agnès Varda, a film which looks back on her life and revisits Gómez's family and friends. In the documentary, they describe her [[film set]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s as social events and that Sara would listen to everyone's input, of professionals and those who were not. Actor Mario Balmaseda notes "We spent a lot of time with people from this area, almost three, four months living with them sometimes sleeping and eating in their home, and this made it a lot easier. We slipped from a professional level into friendship." In the documentary, she is praised by her family as as a woman who refused to choose between family and normal life. &lt;ref&gt;Alessandra Muller. Sara Gomez: An Afro-Cuban Filmmaker. (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sexposition scene in Game of Thrones.png|thumb|right|The scene that caused a critic to coin the word "sexposition": In ''[[Game of Thrones]]'', [[Petyr Baelish]] ([[Aidan Gillen]]) explains his character's childhood and goals to two actresses who are simulating sexual activity.]]
In visual media such as television and film, '''sexposition''' is the technique of providing [[exposition (literary technique)|exposition]] against a backdrop of sex or nudity.&lt;ref name="Guardian 11 March 2012"&gt;{{cite news|last=Hann|first=Michael|title=How 'sexposition' fleshes out the story|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2012/mar/11/sexposition-story-tv-drama?newsfeed=true|accessdate=March 29, 2012|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=March 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Financial Times]]'' defined sexposition as "keeping viewers hooked by combining complex plot exposition with explicit sexual goings-on".&lt;ref name=ft_lunch /&gt; Its purpose, according to [[James Poniewozik]], is to divert the audience and give characters something to do while exposition is being delivered, which is what distinguishes sexposition from merely gratuitous titillation.&lt;ref name="Guardian 11 March 2012" /&gt;

==Etymology==
The term was coined in 2011 by the blogger and critic Myles McNutt&lt;ref&gt;Originally in: {{cite web|last=McNutt|first=Myles|title=Game of Thrones – "You Win or You Die"|url=http://cultural-learnings.com/2011/05/29/game-of-thrones-you-win-or-you-die/ |work=cultural-learnings.com |date=May 29, 2011|accessdate=March 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; to describe scenes in the [[HBO]] TV series ''[[Game of Thrones]]''&lt;ref name="Guardian 11 March 2012" /&gt; in which characters reveal crucial information related to plot and character development during intimate scenes. Author [[George R. R. Martin]] said this technique is in line with the purpose of sexuality in the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' books, and acknowledged that this technique allows for the exposition of motivations and incentives not available to the TV show.&lt;ref name=ft_lunch&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/bd1e2638-a8b7-11e1-a747-00144feabdc0.html#axzz1wYzURCl0 | title=Lunch with the FT: George RR Martin | work=Financial Times | date=June 2, 2012 | accessdate=June 4, 2012 | author=Berwick, Isabel }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "sexposition" has since been retroactively applied to similar practices in many earlier works, including the older HBO shows ''[[Deadwood (TV series)|Deadwood]]'' and ''[[The Sopranos]]'' (frequently set in a strip club), many older cop films (likewise) and even the 1930s comic strip ''[[Jane (comic strip)|Jane]]''. According to critic Poniewozik, the novelty of the practice is not the nudity, but the manner in which it accompanies exposition, for which older TV shows with less complex plots did not have as much need.&lt;ref name="Guardian 11 March 2012"/&gt;

==Criticism==
Critics have  disapproved of sexposition because, in their view, it uses inappropriate tactics, insults the audience's intelligence by appealing and succumbing to carnality and covers up the screenwriter's failure to build cohesive narratives, having to rely on long drawn out sequences of exposition made watchable only through appeals to sexuality.&lt;ref name="Guardian 11 March 2012" /&gt; Some criticize sexposition for catering almost exclusively to heterosexual men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/2014/06/16/game_of_thrones_fails_the_female_gaze_why_does_prestige_tv_refuse_to_cater_erotically_to_women |title="Game of Thrones" fails the female gaze: Why does prestige TV refuse to cater erotically to women? |publisher=Salon |accessdate=January 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Neil Marshall]], director of the second-season episode "[[Blackwater (Game of Thrones)|Blackwater]]", recalled that he was repeatedly urged to add more full-frontal nudity during filming. The producer told him, according to the director, that "[e]veryone else in the series is drama side. I represent the pervy side of the audience", an experience that Marshall described as "pretty surreal" to happen on the set of a major network production.&lt;ref name="plumb20120601"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.empireonline.com/news/story.asp?NID=34164 | title=Neil Marshall Game Of Thrones Podcast | work=Empire | date=June 1, 2012 | accessdate=June 1, 2012 | author=Marshall, Neil}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Game of Thrones'' showrunner David Benioff admitted that he does "pay less attention to intricate plot points delivered during sex scenes", while co-creator [[D. B. Weiss]] disagreed, countering that "Sex grabs people's attention. But once it has their attention, it tends not to let go of it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://www.motherjones.com/media/2013/03/hbo-game-thrones-season-3-interview-david-benioff-dan-weiss | title="Game of Thrones" Creators on Shark, Sexposition, and Season 3 | work=Mother Jones | issue=March/April 2013 |date=March 5, 2013 | accessdate=March 7, 2013 | author=Mechanic, Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the effect is reportedly different for different directors, they say "Every one of those sex scenes is there because we wanted that particular scene in the show. There is not a sex scene quota from HBO."&lt;ref name="egner20130329"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/03/29/your-game-of-thrones-questions-answered/ | title=Your ‘Game of Thrones’ Questions, Answered | work=The New York Times | date=2013-03-29 | accessdate=March 29, 2013 | author=Egner, Jeremy}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' reported before the seventh season in 2017 that "Even if Benioff and Weiss don’t always admit it, the show has changed. Scenes in which exposition is delivered in one brothel or another, for example, have been pared back".&lt;ref name="daddario2017"&gt;{{Cite magazine |last=D'Addadio |first=Daniel |date=2017-07-10 |title='Game of Thrones': Inside the World's Most Popular Show |url=http://time.com/game-of-thrones-2017/ |magazine=Time |access-date=2017-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Satire==
Fan site Winter is Coming cited an April 2012 skit on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' when discussing Marshall's anecdote.&lt;ref name="wic20120601"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://winteriscoming.net/2012/06/blackwater-director-neil-marshall-on-nudity-and-creating-the-battle/ | title="Blackwater" director Neil Marshall on nudity and creating the battle | work=Winter is Coming | date=June 1, 2012 | accessdate=June 1, 2012 | author=Ours is the Fury}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aired more than a month before the Marshall interview was published, the skit purported to be an episode of ''[[HBO First Look]]'' featuring Adam Friedberg, 13 year-old "creative consultant" to ''Game of Thrones''. Played by [[Andy Samberg]], the teenage boy was proud of "mak[ing] sure there are lots of boobs" and various sexual acts during expository scenes. Author Martin ([[Bobby Moynihan]]) called Friedberg "a visionary. He knows that even when I didn't write sex into a scene, I was definitely thinking about it."&lt;ref name="snl20120414"&gt;{{cite episode | title=HBO First Look: Game of Thrones | series=Saturday Night Live | url=http://gawker.com/5902076/snl-explains-the-nudity-in-game-of-thrones | credits=Samberg, Andy; Moynihan, Bobby; Killam, Taran | network=NBC | airdate=April 14, 2012 | number=721  | season=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sims20120415"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/josh-brolingotye,71972/ | title=Josh Brolin/Gotye, S37/E19 | work=A.V.

&lt;!--Wikipedia is an encyclopedia. Please do not add personal recipes for stain removal without citing.--&gt;
A '''stain''' is a discoloration that can be clearly distinguished from the surface, material, or medium it is found upon. They are caused by the chemical or physical interaction of two dissimilar materials. Staining is used for [[staining (biology)|biochemical research]], metal staining, and [[art]] (e.g.,&amp;nbsp;[[wood staining]], [[stained glass]]).

==Types==
There can be intentional stains (such as [[wood]] stains or [[paint]]),&lt;ref name="stainbook"&gt;{{cite journal | title = Understanding Wood Finishing: How to Select and Apply the Right Finish | author = Bob Flexner | journal = Reader's Digest | date = 1999 | pages = 121 | isbn = 978-0-7621-0191-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; indicative stains (such as [[food coloring]] or adding a substance to make [[bacteria]] visible under a [[microscope]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title = Staining Procedures Used by the Biological Stain Commission: Published for the Biological Stain Commission | author = George Clark, James W. Bartholomew | publisher = Williams &amp; Wilkins | date = 1981 | pages = 32–33 | isbn = 978-0-683-01707-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; natural stains (such as [[rust]] on iron or a [[patina]] on [[bronze]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Architectural Metals: A Guide to Selection, Specification, and Performance | author = [[L. William Zahner]] | publisher = Wiley | date = 1997 | page = 101 | isbn = 978-0-471-04506-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and accidental stains such as [[ketchup]] on a shirt.

Different types of material can be stained by different substances, and stain resistance is an important characteristic in modern [[textile engineering]].

==Formation==
The primary method of stain formation is surface stains, where the staining substance is spilled out onto the surface or material and is trapped in the fibers, pores, indentations, or other capillary structures on the surface.&lt;ref name="stainbook" /&gt; The material that is trapped coats the underlying material, and the stain reflects back light according to its own color. Applying paint, spilled food, and wood stains are of this nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Materials Performance | author = NACE International | publisher = National Association of Corrosion Engineers | date = 1987 | volume = 26 | page = 33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A secondary method of stain involves a [[chemical reaction|chemical]] or molecular reaction between the material and the staining material. Many types of natural stains fall into this category.

Finally, there can also be molecular attraction between the material and the staining material, involving being held in a [[covalent bond]] and showing the color of the bound substance.&lt;ref name="stainbook2"&gt;{{cite book | title = The Stain Removal Handbook | author = Max Alth, Simon Alth | publisher = Hawthorn Books | date = 1977 | page = 22 | isbn = 978-0-8015-7071-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Properties==
In many cases, stains are affected by [[heat]] and may become reactive enough to bond with the underlying material. Extreme heat, such as from [[ironing]] or [[dry cleaning]], can cause a chemical reaction on an otherwise removable stain, turning it into a chemical compound that is impossible to remove.&lt;ref name="stainbook2" /&gt;

==Removal==
Various [[laundry]] techniques exist to attempt to remove or minimize existing stains, and [[Stain removal|stain remover]]s are an important type of chemical in [[laundry detergent]]s. Some stand-alone stain removers also exist. If the wrong technique is used to remove the stain or stain mark on the clothing it could actually cause permanent damage to the clothing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.laundrycares.com/laundry-stain-removal/ Solutions for Clothing and Laundry Stain Removal]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Temperance''' "'''Bones'''" '''Brennan, Ph.D.''' (born '''Joy Keenan''') is a fictional [[Character (arts)|character]] portrayed by [[Emily Deschanel]] in the American [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] television series ''[[Bones (TV series)|Bones]]''.  An [[Anthropology|anthropologist]], [[Forensic anthropology|forensic anthropologist]], and [[Kinesiology|kinesiologist]], she is described in the series as a leading [[authority]] in the field of [[forensic anthropology]]. Brennan first appeared on television, along with other series characters, in the "[[Pilot (Bones)|Pilot]]" episode of ''Bones'' on September 13, 2005. She is the main protagonist of the series along with FBI Special Agent [[Seeley Booth]] ([[David Boreanaz]]).

Brennan is loosely based on author [[Kathy Reichs]]. Her name originates from the heroine in Reichs's crime novel series, also named [[Temperance Brennan]].&lt;ref&gt;Goldman, Eric, "[http://tv.ign.com/articles/793/793242p1.html Digging Up Secrets With the Cast of Bones]", ''[[IGN]]'', May 31, 2007.

==Character history==
Temperance "Bones" Brennan is a forensic anthropologist who works in the Medico-Legal lab at the Jeffersonian Institute in Washington, D.C. She received her Ph.D. from [[Northwestern University]], as stated in "The Girl in the Fridge". She has three doctorates, as referred to by Dr. Jack Hodgins in the episode "The Parts of the Sum in the Whole", in [[anthropology]], [[forensic anthropology]] and [[kinesiology]]; it is implied that most of her work at the lab was related to either long-dead bodies or victims of [[genocide]].&lt;ref name="Pilot"&gt;{{Cite episode |title= Pilot|series= Bones (TV series)|network= Fox|airdate= |season= 1|number=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Parts in the Sum"&gt;{{Cite episode |title= The Parts in the Sum of the Whole|series= Bones (TV series)|network= Fox|airdate= 2010-04-08|season= 5|number= 16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her occasional contract work for the FBI shifted the focus of her work.&lt;ref name="Parts in the Sum"/&gt;  She was paired with FBI Special Agent [[Seeley Booth]], and helped to solve two difficult cases;&lt;ref name="Pilot"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Parts in the Sum"/&gt; since then, they have worked together almost exclusively on modern-day murder cases.

Brennan works with a group of other well-qualified colleagues, including the [[entomology|entomologist]] [[Jack Hodgins (Bones)|Jack Hodgins]], her boss and [[Forensic pathology|forensic pathologist]] [[Camille Saroyan]], [[forensic art]]ist [[Angela Montenegro]], and a host of eager graduate students. Booth refers to her crew of colleagues as "squints", because they come to crime scenes and squint at evidence.  He is also responsible for her nickname, "Bones", which she initially detested.&lt;ref name="Pilot"/&gt;

In the first-season finale (which aired on May 17, 2006), Brennan stated that she was born in 1976,&lt;ref name="Woman in Limbo"/&gt; which would have made her either 29 or 30 (approximately the same age as Deschanel, who was born on October 11, 1976). In the fifth-season episode "The Death of the Queen Bee" (which aired nearly four years later, on April 15, 2010), it is implied that her then-current age was 33 years (based on Brennan's identification of a former high school classmate as the victim and statement that the classmate was 33).

First mentioned in season 1, Brennan has a love of dolphins, which she shared with her late mother: in the season one finale, "The Woman in Limbo", Brennan examines a custom-made belt with a dolphin on the buckle, which had belonged to her mother, and which she mentions having once borrowed without asking first.  Brennan's love of dolphins is highlighted again in season 2 episodes "The Titan on the Tracks", "The Killer in the Concrete" and "Stargazer in a Puddle", when she mentions the constellation [[Delphinus]], (the Dolphin), her and her mother's favorite. In season 6, "The Doctor in the Photo", she is shown to wear a dolphin ring.

In "Mummy in the Maze", Brennan exhibited [[ophidiophobia]] when confronted with snakes, but later only shows a moment of fright when confronted with another snake in "The Mastodon in the Room". She takes note of this, voicing her observation that she only seems to lose her head around snakes when Booth is also "there to be jumped upon", and also she mentions that she once had a pet snake during high school. It should also be noted that, in "The Man in the Morgue," Brennan handled a snake without any trace of fear, even while Booth is in the room.

In season one, in "A Man on Death Row", Dr. Brennan expresses her stance on the [[death penalty]]; "I believe in the death penalty. There are certain people who shouldn't be in this world. The people who [[Rwandan genocide|hacked hundreds of innocent children to death]] in [[Rwanda]]; beheaded them at their desks at school! The people who did that, they should be executed."  In "The Woman at the Airport", Dr. Brennan is shown to have a strong dislike for [[plastic surgery|plastic surgeons]], believing them to be no more than "glorified butchers with medical degrees", and this dislike is voiced again in [[Bones (season 4)|season 4]], in "Cinderella in the Cardboard".  In "The Woman in the Car", Dr. Brennan reveals that her third doctorate is in [[kinesiology]], a field that would allow her and Angela to unravel how one of the bodies that had been found had been killed.

In season two, she expressed the desire to get a pet pig, whom she would have named "Jasper".  Brennan's expertise in [[kinesiology]] would again prove its worth in "The Truth in the Lye" (she could tell that one of the murder suspects was pregnant just from having observed her [[Gait (human)|gait]]), in "The Girl with the Curl" (she could tell if one of the young beauty pageant contestants was suffering from [[scoliosis]] just by watching them perform on stage), and in "The Woman in the Sand" (while undercover with Booth, she was able to tell Booth exactly how to beat his opponent from just having watched his moves).  In "Judas on a Pole", she and her brother are identified as having the same [[blood type]], blood type O.  In "Glowing Bones in the Old Stone House", she is shown to be a good cook: Booth's comment on her [[Macaroni and cheese|mac and cheese]] is that he'd "like to be alone with it".

In the season 3 episode, "Mummy in the Maze", it is revealed that Brennan's favorite [[superhero]] is [[Wonder Woman]], and that she always goes as Wonder Woman to the Jeffersonian's [[Halloween]] party.  In "The Baby in the Bough", it is revealed that Brennan is a registered [[foster parent]], at her brother's request, to take in his stepdaughters in case anything should happen to him and his girlfriend.  In the season 3 episode, "Intern in the Incinerator", Booth reveals that Brennan's favorite flower is a [[Daffodil]], her second favorite flower is a [[Asteraceae|Daisy]], and her favorite planet is [[Jupiter]].

In season 5, in "The Death of the Queen Bee", when asked if she'd had a pet rat, Brennan discloses that she, in fact, had a pet mouse, snake and some spiders.  During her time at [[Tim Burton|Burtonsville]] high school, her only friend was the school custodian, [[Robert Englund|Ray Buxley]], with whom she would enjoy long, in-depth conversations on life and death, and who would also provide her with dead animals to dissect (Brennan having set out to become a [[forensic anthropology|forensic anthropologist]],) and who would later be one of her books' biggest fans (she having named the killer in her first book, ''Bred in the Bone'', after him).  According to the Burtonsville high school on-line [[yearbook]] entry on Brennan, in her senior year, she was a member of the [[Chemistry]] club and [[mathematics|Math]] club, her interests were chemistry and mathematics, and she was a [[National Merit Scholarship Program|National Merit Scholar]] and an Academic All Star.

In the season 6 episode, "The Blackout in the Blizzard", Brennan mentions her pet iguana for the first time.  This same episode show that one of the number of scientific publications that Brennan reads is ''Medicinal Physics Quarterly'', with one article on [[electrostatic]]s and triboluminescence proving useful during the lab's power outage.  Further concerning her pet iguana in "The Truth in the Myth", as a part of his rehab from alcohol abuse, Vincent Nigel-Murry made apologies for, among other things, having borrowed her iguana one night, wearing him as a hat for a party. She comments that he must have taken good care of her iguana as she has observed nothing wrong with him and further expresses some surprise that Vincent Nigel-Murry was able to get her iguana to stay perched atop his head, to which he replies that he was good with ribbons.

In season 8, "The Tiger in the Tale", Booth mentions to Sweets that Dr. Brennan once took [[Peyote]] with [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]].

In season 11, "The Senator in the Street Sweeper", Dr. Brennan is mentioned to be a member of the [[Green Party of the United States]] along with Dr. Hodgins.

===Family and early life===
Although Brennan seemed to have a relatively normal childhood, her parents disappeared when she was 15 years old.&lt;ref name="Fallout Shelter"&gt;{{Cite episode|title=The Man in the Fallout Shelter |series=Bones|airdate=2005-12-13 |season=1 |number=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Her older brother [[List of Bones characters#Russ Brennan|Russ]], himself still an adolescent, was unable to care for her and she was put in the foster care system. By the time she started college she had been to twelve different schools and has specifically said that she hated the lack of consistency.&lt;ref name="Guck"/&gt;

There has been contradictory evidence about her time in the system; in one episode, Brennan stated that her grandfather got her out of the foster system,&lt;ref name="Boy in a Bush"&gt;{{Cite episode |title= A Boy in a Bush|series= Bones (TV series)|network= Fox|airdate=2005-11-08 |season= 1|number= 5}}&lt;/ref&gt; but in a later episode, she indicates that she never knew her grandparents (possibly the two references are to two separate sets of grandparents, [[paternal]] and [[maternal]]).&lt;ref name="Stargazer"&gt;{{Cite episode |title= The Stargazer in the Puddle|series= Bones (TV series)|network= Fox|airdate= 2007-05-16|season= 2|number= 21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, taking into consideration the fact that Brennan's parents had assumed new identities when she was 3-years-old, the grandfather who had taken her in from her time in the foster system may not have been her biological grandfather.

Her time in foster care was quite [[psychological trauma|traumatic]] and abusive; Brennan indicated that she was once locked in the trunk of a car for two days because she broke a plate,&lt;ref name="Mayhem"&gt;{{Cite episode |title= Mayhem on the Cross|series= Bones (TV series)|network= Fox|airdate= |season=4 |number=21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the episode "The Finger in the Nest", she reveals to Booth that she walked into her elderly neighbor's house to find the woman dead. In the same episode, she also mentions to Booth that her parents were very concerned about her afterwards, because she started faking her own death.  In Season 2, she mentions that during her time in the foster care system, she kept a list of foster homes she had been kicked out of on the bottom of her shoe.

In the first season she hands Booth the file on her parents' disappearance and he agrees to look into it as a personal favor.&lt;ref name="The Man on the Fairway"&gt;{{Cite episode | title=The Man on the Fairway|episodelink=Bones (season 1)#ep14|series=Bones|serieslink= Bones (TV series)| network= Fox| airdate=March 8, 2006| season=1|number=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is later revealed in Season 2 that her parents, who were bank robbers specializing in [[safety deposit box]]es, changed the family's identity after they stole some damaging FBI documents regarding the murder of an FBI agent and the false imprisonment of civil rights activist Marvin Beckett. Brennan's birth name was Joy Keenan.&lt;ref name="Woman in Limbo"/&gt; Her mother (real name Ruth Keenan, known under the assumed identity of Christine Brennan) had hoped to someday return to her children and family, but made a tape for Brennan to watch on her 16th birthday in case that never happened.  Brennan later discovered that Ruth/Christine was murdered in 1993, two years after she and her husband went on the run.

Her father [[List of Bones characters#Matthew Brennan / Max Keenan|Max Keenan]] re-entered Brennan's life when she and her brother were being threatened by an old acquaintance, who turned out to be Booth's boss, Deputy Director Kirby.&lt;ref name="Judas on a Pole"&gt;{{Cite episode |title=Judas on a Pole |series= Bones (TV series)|network= Fox|airdate= |season=2 |number=11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Max evades capture after killing Kirby, and takes Russ into hiding to protect him.&lt;ref name="Judas on a Pole"/&gt;  Later, Max allows Booth to arrest him in order to improve his relationship with his daughter.&lt;ref name="Stargazer"/&gt;  At trial, Max is acquitted of murdering Director Kirby (due in large part to a defense Booth indirectly came up with, positing an alternate theory of the crime in which Temperance was the killer instead, creating reasonable doubt), and he begins to rebuild his life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title=The Verdict in the Story |series= Bones (TV series)|network= Fox|airdate= |season= 3|number= 12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He temporarily works at the Jeffersonian as a guide for children visiting the place and demonstrates his brilliant talent as a former science teacher. However, Brennan is concerned about a convicted felon having access to a lab that investigates crimes.&lt;ref name="Bones that Blew"&gt;{{Cite episode |title= The Bones that Blew |series= Bones (TV series)|network= Fox|airdate= |season= 4|number=11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Max also introduces Brennan to her cousin [[List of Bones characters#Margaret Whitesell|Margaret Whitesell]],&lt;ref name="Goop on the Girl"&gt;{{Cite episode |title= The Goop on the Girl |series= Bones (TV series)|network= Fox|airdate= |season= 5|number= 10}}&lt;/ref&gt; portrayed by Deschanel's real-life sister [[Zooey Deschanel]].

Brennan is best friends with her coworker, Angela, saying in the 6th-season premiere she loves Angela "like a sister" and is going to be an aunt to Hodgins' and Angela's newborn child. It is revealed at the end of the season six finale "The Change in the Game" that Brennan is pregnant and the father is Booth.

In Season 7, episode 2 "The Hot Dog in the Competition", Brennan and Booth found out they were having a baby girl. Their daughter, Christine Angela Booth (named for Brennan's mother and her best friend), was born in a stable during the episode "The Prisoner in the Pipe".  In the Season 7 finale, "The Past in the Present", key evidence in the death of her friend, Ethan Sawyer, is linked to Brennan. [[List of Bones characters#Matthew Brennan / Max Keenan|Max]] convinces her to go on the run along with Christine, saying that if she is arrested, even if she is found innocent, she may never see her daughter again.

In Season 8 premiere, it is revealed that while on the run, Brennan was communicating with Angela, via [[Language of flowers|flowers]], and eventually used this as a way to communicate with Booth. Despite being on the run, Brennan risks her safety and decides to meet directly with Booth in a hotel room after months of being a single mother. Eventually, they arrest Christopher Pelant, who was the real murderer of Ethan Sawyer, and Brennan is allowed to return to her family. Although Pelant blackmails Booth to prevent him from accepting Brennan's proposal by threatening to kill five innocent people if Booth accepted, also warning Booth not to give a reason for his refusal, this threat is removed when the team manage to kill Pelant, and Booth and Brennan marry in the Season 9 episode 'The Woman in White'.

In the Season 10 episode, "The Eye in the Sky", Brennan learns that she is pregnant with her and Booth's second child.

==Characterization==
Throughout the course of the series, Brennan is portrayed as a straightforward, brilliant anthropologist, who lacks social skills. Her social ineptitude is especially apparent when it comes to sarcasm, metaphors which she often interprets literally, and pop culture jokes and is often the source of comedy in the show.&lt;ref name="Pilot"/&gt; An example of this is when she mistakes [[Colin Farrell]] for [[Will Ferrell]].&lt;ref name="Boy in a Bush"/&gt; In earlier seasons, she was characterized as straightforward and unable to detect social cues – she states that Booth once told her that she "stinks at non-verbal communication"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Fire in the Ice|episodelink=Bones (season 4)#ep71|series=Bones|serieslink=Bones (TV series)|network=Fox|date=January 22, 2009|season=4|number=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; – and was well-known within the FBI for being extremely difficult to work with. She began to acknowledge her lack of sensitivity after Booth bluntly told her outright that she was "bad with people" in "[[A Boy in a Tree]]". Her lack of "political savvy" and social skills was also a reason why she was passed over for Dr. Camille Saroyan as head of the Jeffersonian in Season 2. Other characters have described her as "no fun"&lt;ref name="mystery"/&gt; and "a rigid traditionalist".&lt;ref name="Guck"&gt;{{Cite episode |title= The Geek in the Guck |series= Bones|serieslink=Bones (TV series)|episodelink=Bones (season 10)#ep194|network= Fox|airdate=October 16, 2014 |season=10|number= 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She had a difficult adolescence, and it is implied, often by Sweets, that her withdrawn social tendencies are a defense mechanism. She also sometimes struggles in identifying and explaining her emotions, and takes comfort in the rationality of her anthropological discipline. Although it has been stated that Brennan was based on a person with [[Asperger syndrome]], this has never been confirmed in the plot of the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Ellen |last=Gray |url=http://www.philly.com/dailynews/columnists/ellen_gray/20070131_Ellen_Gray___Boreanaz_says__Bones__is_not_procedural.html |title=Boreanaz says 'Bones' is not procedural |date=31 January 2007 |work=[[Philadelphia Daily News]] |accessdate=2010-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The creator of the series has stated that the character was never labeled as having the syndrome in order to increase the appeal of the show on network television.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |first=Alan |last=Sepinwall |url=http://www.nj.com/entertainment/tv/index.ssf/2010/02/how_tv_shows_try_or_choose_not.html |title=How TV shows try (or choose not) to depict Asperger's syndrome |accessdate=2010-03-01 |work=[[The Star-Ledger]] |location=Newark, N.J. |date=28 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This influence on her character also helps to explain her extreme rationality in early seasons, as well as some of her social difficulties. Brennan is a self-proclaimed atheist and often points out what she believes to be the irrationality of religious and spiritual beliefs.  This has led to more than one argument with Booth, who is a devout Roman Catholic; he becomes particularly irate when she compares less common religions, such as [[Haitian Vodou|voodoo]], to Christianity.&lt;ref name="Man in the Morgue"&gt;{{Cite episode |title= The Man in the Morgue|series= Bones (TV series)|network= Fox|airdate= 2006-04-16|season= 1|number= 19}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the ''[[Sleepy Hollow (TV series)|Sleepy Hollow]]'' crossover episode "Dead Men Tell No Tales", ''Sleepy Hollow'' protagonist Ichabod Crane notes that Brennan is so sceptical that she would dismiss the demon Moloch &amp;mdash; the primary antagonist in the first two seasons of ''Sleepy Hollow'' &amp;mdash; as nothing more than a tall man with a skin condition, although this does leave him reassured that she will not realise the nature of the secret tomb they have uncovered underneath the White House.

Brennan is a bestselling author, who has been on the [[The New York Times Best Seller List|''New York Times'' Best Seller List]] for 18 weeks.&lt;ref name="Wannabe"&gt;{{Cite episode |title= The Wannabe in the Weeds|series= Bones (TV series)|network= Fox|airdate=2008-05-12|season=2 |number= 8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She is trained in three types of martial arts,&lt;ref name="Man in the Morgue"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Aliens in the Spaceship"&gt;{{Cite episode |title= The Aliens in the Spaceship |series= Bones (TV series)|network= Fox|airdate= |season=2 |number=9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; has hunting licenses in four states,&lt;ref name="Man in the Morgue"/&gt; and has a legally registered gun&lt;ref name="Pilot"/&gt; as well as a diving certificate.&lt;ref name="The Man with the Bone"&gt;{{Cite episode |title= The Man with the Bone|series= Bones (TV series)|network= Fox|airdate= |season= 1|number= 18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She promised to consider becoming a vegetarian after seeing how pigs were slaughtered (which was also the way her mother had been killed).&lt;ref name="Woman in Limbo"&gt;{{Cite episode |title= The Woman in Limbo|series= Bones (TV series)|network= Fox|airdate= |season= 1|number= 22}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in "The Tough Man in the Tender Chicken" (season 5, episode 6) Angela cites health reasons for Brennan's vegetarian diet.  Brennan is also a trained amateur [[tightrope walker|highwire performer]],&lt;ref name="Double Trouble"&gt;{{Cite episode |title= Double Trouble in the Panhandle |series= Bones (TV series)|network= Fox|airdate= |season= 4|number= 12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and speaks at least seven other languages, including Spanish,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title= The Woman in the Garden|series= Bones (TV series)|network= Fox|airdate= |season= 1|number= 13}}&lt;/ref&gt; French,&lt;ref name="Pilot"/&gt; Latin,&lt;ref name="Boy in a Tree"&gt;{{Cite episode |title= A Boy in a Tree |series= Bones (TV series)|network= Fox|airdate= |season=1 |number= 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chinese,&lt;ref name="Bride in the River"/&gt; Pashto&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode|title=The Source in the Sludge|series=Bones (TV series)|network=Fox|date=|season=9|number=16|airdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Japanese,&lt;ref name="Girl in the Mask"&gt;{{Cite episode |title= The Girl in the Mask |series= Bones (TV series)|network= Fox|airdate= |season= 4|number=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Norwegian (although she says only "skull" and avers that, as a forensic anthropologist, this is a word she knows "in just about every language"),&lt;ref name="Mayhem"/&gt; Farsi, and German.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title= The Blonde in the Game|series= Bones (TV series)|network= Fox|airdate= |season=2 |number= 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She has also admitted to knowing a bit of Russian.&lt;ref name="Double Trouble"/&gt; She often says she does not "put much stock in psychology" and makes a point of noting that Dr. Sweets is not a real scientist as he "bases his life on the vagary of psychology and emotions".

Brennan's personality undergoes significant changes throughout the course of the series. Her thinking becomes less rigid in later seasons, something which is observed by Dr. Gordon Wyatt, who notes that she is now able to distinguish the difference between accuracy and truth.&lt;ref name="Dwarf in the Dirt"&gt;{{Cite episode |title= The Dwarf in the Dirt|series= Bones (TV series)|network= Fox|airdate= |season= 5|number=7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In season 4, Booth takes her along to his interrogations and helps her learn how to set aside her scientific perspective and relate with the victim's family and suspects on a more interpersonal level. She is also able to put aside her rationality to support her friends in sometimes irrational pursuits, such as Angela's quest to raise money to save a pig from slaughter,&lt;ref name="Tender Chicken"&gt;{{Cite episode |title= The Tough Man in the Tender Chicken |series= Bones (TV series)|network= Fox|airdate= |season=5 |number= 6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to comfort Booth, even using science or quoting directly from the Bible to rationalize his religious beliefs. Her sensitivity and empathy towards others are also much improved, seen quite strongly when she comforts his grandfather,&lt;ref name="Foot in the Foreclosure"&gt;{{Cite episode |title= The Foot in the Foreclosure"|series= Bones (TV series)|network= Fox|airdate= |season= 5|number= 8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and when she attends a funeral so that the victim's single mother won't be alone.&lt;ref name="Goop on the Girl"/&gt; She also displays more "typical" human emotions when in extreme stress. One example of this is her fear of snakes in "The Mummy in the Maze," when a girl is in the process of being scared to death in a room, the floor teeming with snakes. This goes against her empirical nature, as, when Booth tells her that the snakes aren't venomous, she states that she is aware, but still refuses to step in the room, causing Booth to carry her on his back.

Brennan begins to feel both dissatisfaction and discomfort with her work toward the end of the fifth season.&lt;ref name="Boy with the Answer"&gt;{{Cite episode |title= The Boy with the Answer|series= Bones (TV series)|network= Fox|airdate= |season=5 |number= 21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She also sees some futility in her work, stating that no matter how many killers they catch, there will always be more.&lt;ref name="Beginning in the End"&gt;{{Cite episode |title= The Beginning in the End|series= Bones (TV series)|network= Fox|airdate= |season=5 |number=22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  To help her gain new perspective, she later decides to head up an anthropological expedition to Indonesia for a year to identify some ancient proto-human remains, after mulling it over during the episode.&lt;ref name="Beginning in the End"/&gt; However, 7 months later, she and everyone else return to D.C. in order to save Cam's job, and they all decide to stay.

As season 6 progresses, Brennan must confront her feelings for Booth, whom she rejected in the 100th episode from the previous season. Having returned from 7 months of introspection, she has come to terms with her romantic affection towards him, even admitting that she regretted not having given them a chance together, midway through the season. However, Booth returns from Afghanistan with a new love interest, war correspondent Hannah Burley, whom Brennan befriends. When Hannah rejects Booth's marriage proposal, Brennan must help him through the emotional fallout.

In the second to last episode of season 6 Booth and Brennan had sex, consummating their relationship, and it is revealed in the last few moments of the season finale that as a result, Brennan has become pregnant, with Booth the father. Throughout the episode ("The Change in the Game") Brennan has been seen asking Angela questions and making comments that make her seem excited and apprehensive; when she sees that Booth is happy with the news, she also seems overjoyed. This reflects her earlier desire to become a mother, circa season 4, as well as her desire that Booth be the father of the baby.

In the Season 8 episode "The Shot in the Dark", Brennan is shot while working in the lab late at night.  While undergoing emergency surgery, she experiences a vision of meeting with her deceased mother, Christine Brennan.  Initially dismissing this as a hallucination, Brennan experiences several more visions throughout the episode. During these discussions, it's revealed that Brennan's hyper rationalization originates from the very last piece of advice her mother gave to her (before going on the run) which was to use her brain instead of her heart.  While that advice enabled Brennan to survive all these years, the vision of her mother explains, it's now time for Brennan to do more than just survive.

Since entering a relationship with and marrying Booth and then having children, the character has undergone development personally and is shown to be a caring wife and protective mother. She would often put aside her own atheistic views and uses her hyper-rationality to justify Booth's religious beliefs, as shown in season 8 where she references the Bible in order to persuade Booth to forgive his mother&lt;ref name="party"&gt;{{cite episode|title=The Party in the Pants|episodelink=Bones (season 8)#ep164|series=Bones|serieslink=Bones (TV series)|network=Fox|date=April 15, 2013|season=8|number=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the season finale where she agrees to a church wedding, rationalizing that she could appreciate the "beauty" of the ceremony and its significance to Booth.&lt;ref name="siege"&gt;{{cite episode|title=The Secret in the Siege|episodelink=Bones (season 8)#ep166|series=Bones|serieslink=Bones (TV series)|network=Fox|date=April 29, 2013|season=8|number=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationships==
Brennan has had a number of relatively short relationships, including an ill-fated date with a man who turned out to be a murderer&lt;ref name="Headless Witch"&gt;{{Cite episode |title= The Headless Witch in the Woods | series = Bones (TV series) | network = Fox| air-date = 2006-11-26|season= 2|number=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the re-kindling of a romance with her former thesis supervisor.  She has stated that although she does not always feel the need for a committed emotional relationship, she has engaged in casual relationships to "satisfy biological urges".&lt;ref name = "Girl in the Fridge"&gt;{{Cite episode | title = The Girl in the Fridge|series= Bones (TV series)| network = Fox | air-date= 2005-11-29|season= 1| number = 8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In one episode, she was spending time with two men, one for his intelligence and the other for his sexual skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.buddytv.com/articles/bones/bones-episode-42-the-man-in-th-22676.aspx | title = Bones: Episode 4.2 "The Man in the Outhouse" Recap |format= web article|work=BuddyTV | access-date = 2010-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Season 5, episode "The Plain in the Prodigy", she tells Booth she lost her virginity at the age of 22 and when asked why she waited so long, she said it was because the decision was "important to her". FBI psychologist Lance Sweets postulates in a number of episodes that Brennan's apprehension over having relationships is largely due in part to the abandonment and abuse she experienced as a teenager after her parents disappeared. It is said that she "hides" herself behind a front of hyper-rationalism and she always keeps people at arms' length, except for those closest to her (namely FBI partner Seeley Booth and best friend Angela Montenegro). After much character growth, Temperance Brennan is now married to her principal love interest of the series Seeley Booth, and they have a daughter (Season 7) and a son together.

===Seeley Booth===
FBI Special Agent [[Seeley Booth]] is Brennan's husband and partner, and the principal liaison between the Jeffersonian and law enforcement agencies. Prior to their marriage, he is also Brennan's principal love interest throughout the series. Although his working style initially clashed with Brennan's,&lt;ref name="Pilot"/&gt; they have since become full-fledged partners.  Their compatibility has become one of the central points of the show, with many new characters mistaking them for a couple and co-workers, especially Angela, constantly speculating that they were "more than partners".&lt;ref name = "Man in the Morgue" /&gt; Booth and Brennan have repeatedly risked their safety to save each other, including when Booth took a bullet meant for Brennan.&lt;ref name="Wannabe"/&gt;  After Booth rescues Brennan from the corrupt Agent Kenton, Booth lifts her off the hook she was hung on by putting her tied hands around his neck even though he himself was severely injured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Two Bodies in the Lab|episodelink=Two Bodies in the Lab|series=Bones|serieslink=Bones (TV series)|network=Fox|date=March 15, 2006|season=1|number=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In "[[Two Bodies in the Lab]]", in season 1, and in "The Rocker in the Rinse Cycle", in season 5, Brennan and Booth's mutual love for [[Foreigner (band)|Foreigner]]'s [[Hot Blooded]] is mentioned; Booth even refers to it as 'their song' in "The Rocker in the Rinse Cycle". Brennan once commented to Dr. Gordon Wyatt (Stephen Fry) that she "[couldn't] think of anything [she] wouldn't do to help Booth."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode | title = The Dwarf in the Dirt|series= Bones (TV series)|network = Fox|airdate= |season=5 |number=7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Brennan's novels are also dedicated to him and the character Special Agent Andy Lister is based on him even though she still denies it.

Initially Brennan was mostly dismissive of Booth due to their opposing worldviews and work styles – which is a source of friction and banter between them. Although she refused to admit it at first, Brennan enjoyed working with him from the beginning, even after their falling out when Booth got her drunk and "fired" her, and, in Season 1, she cajoled him into launching an investigation after finding three bone fragments on a golf course so he could work with the Jeffersonian team on the case despite the fact that the FBI technically had no jurisdiction.&lt;ref name="The Man on the Fairway"/&gt; She often unknowingly offends him on a number of occasions during the first few seasons with her tactlessness, only realizing after being gently admonished by Angela or another member of the team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=The Man in the Bear|episodelink=The Man in the Bear|series=Bones|serieslink=Bones (TV series)|network=Fox|date=November 1, 2005|season=1|number=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=The Man in the Fallout Shelter|episodelink=The Man in the Fallout Shelter|series=Bones|serieslink=Bones (TV series)|network=Fox|date=December 13, 2005|season=1|number=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=The Proof in the Pudding|episodelink=Bones (season 5)#ep96|series=Bones|serieslink=Bones (TV series)|network=Fox|date=January 21, 2010|season=5|number=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; She comes to admire his ability to connect with people and read behavioral cues when interrogating suspects after coming to terms with her own lack of social skills. After finding out about his abusive childhood and haunted past in the Army, she also begins to respect him as a person. Booth, who is particularly taciturn in revealing emotions or speaking about his past, begins to open up to and confide in her. Since entering a relationship with (and eventually marrying) Booth, she is shown to be extremely supportive of him,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=The High in the Low|episodelink=Bones (season 9)#ep186|series=Bones|serieslink=Bones (TV series)|network=Fox|date=April 7, 2014|season=9|number=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=The Male in the Mail|episodelink=Bones (season 7)#ep133|series=Bones|serieslink=Bones (TV series)|network=Fox|date=December 1, 2011|season=7|number=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title= The Cold in the Case|episodelink=Bones (season 9)#ep187|series=Bones|serieslink= Bones (TV series)|network= Fox|airdate=April 14, 2014|season=9|number=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; even at the expense of her friendship with Angela.&lt;ref name="mystery"&gt;{{cite episode|title=The Mystery in the Meat|episodelink=Bones (season 9)#ep176|series=Bones|serieslink=Bones (TV series)|network=Fox|date=November 22, 2013|season=9|number=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, she put aside her own misgivings several times for Booth's benefit; for example, she agrees to have Christine christened into the Catholic church and referenced the Bible when trying to talk Booth into forgiving his mother.

Brennan acquired the nickname "Bones" from Booth. She initially disliked it but comes to regard it with affection. Booth and his son Parker are the only characters in the show she permits to use it and the former rarely addresses her by her first name or "Tempe".

In Season 2 Brennan shot and killed a person for the first time while working on a string of murders connected to serial killer Howard Epps. She was forced to pull the trigger after Epps' accomplice attacked and injured Booth with a pipe. At the end of the episode she confides in Booth of her conflicted feelings and finds comfort in the fact that Booth understood how she felt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title= The Blonde in the Game|episodelink=Bones (season 2)#ep26|series=Bones|serieslink= Bones (TV series)|network= Fox|airdate=September 20, 2006|season=4|number=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The relationship between Brennan and Booth has often become strained when either partner has a significant other. For example, Booth was quite irritable when Brennan dated Agent Sully,&lt;ref name="Girl in the Gator"/&gt; and their relationship was also strained when Booth's brother Jared was showing an interest in Brennan. Brennan constantly needled Booth while he was dating Tessa.

When Brennan decided that she wanted to have a baby, she asked Booth if he would be the sperm donor. He agrees to Brennan's request at first, but subsequently struggles with the thought of not being involved in the life of his prospective child. Eventually he tells Brennan he cannot let her have his child if he is not allowed to be a father to it. Soon thereafter, it is discovered that he has a (benign) brain tumour.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title= The Critic in the Cabernet|series = Bones (TV series) |network= Fox|airdate= |season = 4 | number = 25}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has to undergo surgery, and though the surgery is successful, a poor reaction to anesthesia left him in a coma for several days. While in his coma, Brennan reads to him from her new novel, and he has an elaborate dream in which Brennan is his wife and that she is pregnant, and that the staff at the Jeffersonian play the characters in the novel. When he awakens, he initially suffers from amnesia, not recognizing Brennan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title=The End in the Beginning |series= Bones (TV series) | network = Fox| airdate = |season = 4 | number = 26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title= Harbingers in the Fountain| series = Bones (TV series) | network = Fox|airdate= | season =5 |number=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although for the majority of the series Booth and Brennan denied that their relationship was anything more than friendly professionalism, they admitted to Dr. Sweets that they kissed and nearly spent the night together after their very first case together. After this discussion, Booth attempted to convince Brennan to give a relationship a try. However, she declined, telling him that she, unlike him, is not a gambler, and isn't able to take that kind of a chance.&lt;ref name="Parts in the Sum" /&gt; They have subsequently attempted to date other people,&lt;ref name="Predator in the Pool"&gt;{{Cite episode | title = The Predator in the Pool| series = Bones (TV series) | network = Fox | airdate = | season = 5 | number = 18}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the fact that Booth once comments that he regards Brennan as his "standard" for other women suggests that he, at least, has not completely moved on. Brennan does admit to her best friend Angela Montenegro that as time has gone on, she is unsure if she wants to keep doing consulting work for the FBI, citing that she is tired of murderers and victims, and is constantly worried that something will happen to Booth and she will be unable to save him. In the climax of Season Five, Brennan and Booth part ways for a year – he goes to [[Afghanistan]] while she leaves for the [[Maluku Islands]] in [[Indonesia]] – but they promise to meet, one year from that day, at the Lincoln Memorial.&lt;ref name="Beginning in the End"/&gt;

In the beginning of season six (7 months later), they reunite in the stated place. Booth came back from Afghanistan, along with everyone else from various places, to help save Cam's job. They all decided to stay. Booth has a serious new girlfriend, Hannah, and despite the hints of her colleagues at Brennan's unconscious jealousy of their relationship, she vehemently denies feeling uncomfortable with the new situation. Through subsequent episodes her jealousy and resentfulness began becoming more apparent as Hannah and Booth started becoming more serious. In the episode "The Doctor in the Photo", Brennan realizes she is in love with Booth and confronts him, but she is let down when Booth says that he loves Hannah and she is not a "consolation prize", prompting Brennan to conclude that she has missed her chance, later reflecting that she should move on. In episode 10 of the sixth season "The Body in the Bag", Booth tells his girlfriend about the incident, stating that it (his love for Temperance) was all in the past and whatever he felt, he does not feel it anymore, except for Hannah. However it was clear in the following episode that he still has feelings for Brennan.

Despite her apparent resolve to move on, Brennan later showed sorrow when her father noted that he always thought she and Booth would end up together. During a subsequent case involving a [[polygamist]] who would spend the night with his first wife on the night he was scheduled to sleep alone, Booth commented that, while you can love several people, there is only ever one person you love the most, prompting Brennan to ask what happens when you push that person away, something Booth answered saying that it never truly leaves, adding further weight to the implication that he still has feelings for Brennan. Following Hannah's departure, the two have begun to reconnect, to the point that, during a case that saw the two trapped in an elevator during a blackout for several hours, Booth and Brennan admitted that they are each interested in a relationship, but require more time to sort out their own feelings before they make such a commitment.

In episode 22 of season 6, "The Hole in the Heart", which saw the death of Vincent Nigel-Murray (Brennan's favorite intern) at the hands of renegade sniper Jacob Broadsky, Booth has Brennan stay at his apartment for her safety.  Later that night, Brennan, still overcome with shock and grief over Vincent's death, goes into Booth's bedroom and they talk about the events of that day, and then allows Booth to hold her in bed. It is implied in the following day that they had sex.  In the last scene of the season 6 finale, "The Change in the Game", after the birth of Angela and Hodgins' son, Brennan tells Booth that she is pregnant and that he is the father.

At the start of Season 7, a very pregnant Brennan and Booth are a couple but are going back and forth between apartments. Booth suggests that they should have their own place, whereas Brennan wants Booth to move into her apartment. It causes a minor rift between them, but is resolved when Booth admits why he wants to move into a new house and Brennan having some time to think over it says it's a good idea because she'd need him practically, emotionally and sexually. In episode 6, "The Crack in the Code," they decide to buy a two-story house in the suburbs—which they jokingly called "The Mighty Hut"—that Booth found at a police auction and renovate it, (according to a mailed check sent to Brennan in "The Heiress in the Hill", in [[Bones (season 9)|season 9]], the "Mighty Hut"'s address is "1297 Janus Street, Washington DC, 20002").  In episode 7, "The Prisoner in the Pipe", Brennan goes into labor inside a prison just as she discovers who killed in an inmate there and Booth rushes her out with the intention to take her to the nearest hospital, but they both know she won't make it in time. This leads them to driving to an inn close to the prison. At first, they are rejected and are told to leave, but after some desperate pleading from an agonized Brennan, the two of them are led to a stall where she gives birth to their daughter, [[List of Bones characters#Christine Angela Booth|Christine Angela Booth]] (named after Temperance's mother, Christine Brennan, and Temperance's best friend [[Angela Montenegro]]). Some time after the delivery, Temperance and Seeley both go back to their home where they celebrate with their friends from the Jeffersonian, who brought dinners that would last a few nights as well as a few baby supplies. In "The Past in the Present", Brennan becomes the prime suspect in the murder of her schizophrenic friend, Ethan Sawyer, after supposedly threatening to kill Christine. Max advises Brennan to get off the grid and go into hiding, but she and Booth do not follow up at this suggestion. However, at the end of the episode, after Christine is [[Infant baptism|christened]] in a Catholic church, it is revealed Brennan decided to take her father's advice and flee with her daughter until her name is cleared. Just before Brennan flees town with Christine, she tells Booth she loves him and not just because of their daughter. After she is cleared of Sawyer's murder, Brennan, Booth and Christine resume their family life.

At the end of Season 8, Brennan finally decides to marry Booth. However, their plans are ruined when a vengeful Christopher Pelant blackmails Booth, threatening to kill five random people if Booth marries Brennan. Booth calls off the wedding, but does not explain the real reason to Brennan.  Brennan is devastated but pretends to be fine with this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gonzalez|first=Sandra|title='Bones' season finale shocker: Boss says Booth 'will make this right'|url=http://insidetv.ew.com/2013/04/30/bones-season-8-finale-post-mortem/|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|publisher=[[Time Inc.|Time Inc]]|accessdate=June 6, 2013|date=April 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ryan|first=Maureen|title='Bones' Finale: Pelant Returns And Leaves A Devastated Brennan In His Wake (VIDEO)|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/30/bones-finale-pelant-booth-brennan-video_n_3183598.html|work=[[Huffington Post]]|accessdate=June 6, 2013|date=April 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the season 9 premiere, Brennan fears that since Booth turned down her proposal, she fears that the love from their life is fading. After talking with bartender Aldo Clemens, a former priest and Army chaplain Booth confessed to, she realizes that it was uncharacteristic for Booth to suddenly cancel the wedding as he believed in marriage and that he likely had a legitimate reason to do so. Despite her colleagues' anger at Booth, she decides to stay with him, telling him that she understands that he has his reasons and has faith that he will resolve the issue. In the episode 4, "The Sense in the Sacrifice", after Booth singlehandedly tracks Pelant down through an abandoned building and kills him with a single gunshot, he reveals to her that Pelant had blackmailed him. Pelant had threatened to kill five innocent people if Booth continued with the wedding or went to the police or FBI. At the end of the episode he proposes and she happily accepts; unknown to them, Caroline, Angela and Hodgins witnessed it via the security cameras. In "The Woman in White", Booth and Brennan marry at a small garden ceremony outside the Jeffersonian.

Their infant son Hank Jr. (named after Booth's grandfather) was born off-screen sometime after season 10 and before the beginning of season 11.

===Tim "Sully" Sullivan===
Brennan had a brief relationship with FBI Agent Tim Sullivan ([[Eddie McClintock]]), also known as Sully, whom she met while on a case when Booth was in therapy due to his grief-induced rage over his self-perceived role in the death of serial killer Howard Epps. Sully asked Dr. Brennan out on a date after their case was completed, and they began a relationship.&lt;ref name="Girl in the Gator"&gt;{{Cite episode |title= The Girl in the Gator|series= Bones (TV series)|network= Fox|airdate= 2007-02-07 |season= 2| number= 13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Their relationship ended, however, when Sully decided to sail a boat down to the Caribbean, and Brennan declined to leave the Jeffersonian to go with him despite Angela trying to persuade her to follow him;&lt;ref name="Bride in the River"&gt;{{Cite episode |title= The Boneless Bride in the River|series= Bones (TV series)|network= Fox|airdate= 2007-03-21|season= 2|number= 16}}&lt;/ref&gt; psychiatrist Doctor Gordon Wyatt ([[Stephen Fry]]) speculated that this was due to Brennan being unable to live a life without purpose.
Despite Dr. Wyatt's original perception as to why she stayed, there exist strong indications, especially through Angela's observations of the situation, that the real reason she stayed was because of Booth. Sully returns in Season 12.

[[File:TheGlassTeat.jpg|thumb|First edition (publ. [[Ace Books]])&lt;br&gt;Cover art by [[Leo and Diane Dillon]]]]
'''''The Glass Teat: Essays of Opinion on Television''''' ({{ISBN|0-515-03701-X}}) is a compilation of television reviews and essays written by [[Harlan Ellison]] as a regular weekly column for the ''[[Los Angeles Free Press]]'' from late 1968 into early 1970, discussing the effects of television upon society.  The title implies that TV viewers are analogous with unweaned children. Discussion of television is frequently interspersed in the essays with lengthy asides about Ellison's personal life, experiences and opinions in general.

Modern critics have noted that his criticisms remain relevant.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen King, "Danse Macabre": Chapter VII, Page 132&lt;/ref&gt;  The book's topics were dictated by the trends and fashions of the day. Ellison later collected a second volume of criticism entitled ''The Other Glass Teat''.

'''''The Little Mermaid''''' ({{lang-da|Den lille Havfrue}}) is a bronze statue by [[Edvard Eriksen]], depicting a [[mermaid]]. The sculpture is displayed on a rock by the waterside at the [[Langelinie]] promenade in [[Copenhagen]], Denmark.{{efn|According to German magazine ''[[Der Spiegel]]'', the statue located in Copenhagen harbour has always been an exact copy, with the sculptor's heirs keeping the original at an undisclosed location.&lt;ref name=m3 /&gt;}} It is {{Convert|1.25|m|ft}} tall&lt;ref name="denmark.net"&gt;[http://www.denmark.net/denmark-guide/attractions-denmark/little-mermaid-copenhagen.html Little Mermaid Copenhagen] - ''denmark.net''. Retrieved January 29, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; and weighs {{convert|385|lb|kg|order=flip}}.&lt;ref name="AFP" /&gt;

Based on the [[fairy tale]] [[The Little Mermaid|of the same name]] by Danish author [[Hans Christian Andersen]], the small and unimposing statue is a Copenhagen icon and has been a major tourist attraction since its unveiling in 1913. In recent decades it has become a popular target for defacement by [[vandalism|vandals]] and political activists.

''Mermaid'' is among [[iconic]] statues that symbolize cities; others include: ''[[Manneken Pis]]'' in [[Brussels]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Southwick|first=Albert B.|title=An imaginative explanation of the boy and the turtle|url=http://www.telegram.com/article/20070603/COLUMN21/706030528/0/OPINION|accessdate=August 26, 2013|newspaper=Worcester Telegram &amp; Gazette|date=June 3, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Statue of Liberty]] in New York and ''[[Christ the Redeemer (statue)|Christ the Redeemer]]'' in [[Rio de Janeiro]]. In several cases, cities have commissioned statues for such a purpose, such as with Singapore's ''[[Merlion]]''.

==History==
[[File:Ellen Price as the Little Mermaid, Royal Danish Ballet, 1909.jpg|thumb|200px|left|[[Ellen Price]] as the Little Mermaid, Royal Danish Ballet, 1909.]]
[[File:Assembly of the Little Mermaid statue (Copenhagen, Langeline, 1913).jpg|thumb|300px|Assembly of the Little Mermaid statue (Copenhagen, Langeline, 1913).]]
The statue was commissioned in 1909 by [[Carl Jacobsen]], son of the founder of [[Carlsberg Group|Carlsberg]], who had been fascinated by a ballet about the fairytale in Copenhagen's Royal Theatre and asked the ballerina, [[Ellen Price]], to model for the statue. The sculptor [[Edvard Eriksen]] created the bronze statue, which was unveiled on August 23, 1913.&lt;ref name="Cphp" /&gt; The statue's head was modelled after Price, but as the ballerina did not agree to model in the nude, the sculptor's wife, [[Eline Eriksen]], was used for the body.&lt;ref name="Cphp"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.copenhagenpictures.dk/mermaid.html|title=The Little Mermaid statue in Copenhagen Harbor|accessdate=August 17, 2008|work=Copenhagen Pictures|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19991128173940/http://copenhagenpictures.dk/mermaid.html|archivedate=November 28, 1999|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Copenhagen City Council arranged to move the statue to [[Shanghai]] at the Danish Pavilion for the duration of the [[Expo 2010]] (May to October), the first time it had been moved officially from its perch since it was installed almost a century earlier.&lt;ref name="AFP"&gt;{{cite news|title=Travelling Little Mermaid to resurface in Copenhagen by video|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/travelling-little-mermaid-to-resurface-in-copenhagen-by-video-1959207.html|accessdate=December 30, 2012|newspaper=The Independent|date=April 30, 2010|agency=Agence France-Presse}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Maid in China|url=http://jyllands-posten.dk/uknews/article1434938.ece|accessdate=December 31, 2012|newspaper=Jyllands-Posten|date=September 11, 2008|agency=The Copenhagen Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the statue was away in Shanghai an authorised copy was displayed on a rock in the lake in Copenhagen's nearby [[Tivoli Gardens]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Little Mermaid statue in Tivoli Gardens in 2010|url=http://mermaidsofearth.com/the-little-mermaid-statue-in-tivoli-gardens-denmark/benny-hansen-l/|publisher=Mermaids of Earth|accessdate=May 25, 2014|date=November 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Copenhagen officials have considered moving the statue several meters out into the harbour to discourage vandalism and to prevent tourists from climbing onto it,&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite web|title=Denmark may move Little Mermaid|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4860562.stm|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=December 31, 2012|date=March 30, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; but as of May 2014 the statue remains on dry land at the water side at [[Langelinie]].

===Vandalism===
[[File:Little mermaid examined.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Police technicians examine the damage to the statue after being blasted off its base the day of September 10, 2003.]]
This statue has been damaged and defaced many times since the mid-1960s for various reasons, but has been restored each time.

On April 24, 1964, the statue's head was sawn off and stolen by politically oriented artists of the [[Situationist International|Situationist]] movement, amongst them [[Jørgen Nash]].&lt;ref name="m3" /&gt; The head was never recovered and a new head was produced and placed on the statue.&lt;ref name="m3" /&gt; On July 22, 1984, the right arm was sawn off and returned two days later by two young men.&lt;ref name="m3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=m1&gt;[http://jp.dk/indland/kbh/article1027279.ece Den Lille Havfrue reddet fra gramsende turister] (in Danish).

On January 6, 1998, the statue was decapitated again;&lt;ref name=m1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/45721.stm | work=BBC News | title=Feminists claim responsibility for statue attack | accessdate=May 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; the culprits were never found, but the head was returned anonymously to a nearby television station, and reattached on February 4. On the night of September 10, 2003, the statue was knocked off its base with explosives and later found in the harbour's waters. Holes had been blasted in the mermaid's wrist and knee.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3103906.stm Little Mermaid's unexpected swim], BBC News, September 12, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, the statue was draped in a [[burqa]] in a protest against [[Accession of Turkey to the European Union|Turkey's application to join the European Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Darin|first=Johan|title="Den lilla sjöjungfrun" kläddes i burka|url=http://www.expressen.se/kvp/den-lilla-sjojungfrun-kladdes-i-burka/|accessdate=December 31, 2012|newspaper=Kvällsposten|date=May 20, 2007|language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2007, it was again found draped in Muslim dress and a head scarf.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nysun.com/foreign/danish-mermaid-statue-given-a-headscarf/54847/ Danish Mermaid Statue Given a Headscarf], ''Associated Press'', May 21, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Slave Market''''' ({{Lang-fr|'''Le Marché d'esclaves'''}}) is an 1866 painting by the French artist [[Jean-Léon Gérôme]]. It depicts an unspecific Middle Eastern or North African setting where a man inspects the teeth of a nude, female slave.

The painting was bought by Adolphe Goupil on 23 August 1866 and exhibited at the [[Salon (Paris)|Salon]] in 1867. It was bought and sold several times until [[Robert Sterling Clark]] bought it in 1930. Since 1955 it is part of the [[Clark Art Institute]]'s collection.&lt;ref name="lees"&gt;{{Cite book|editor-last=Lees|editor-first=Sarah|year=2012|url=http://media.clarkart.edu/1955.53_EuroCat.pdf|title=Nineteenth-Century European Paintings at the Sterling and Francine Clark Art Institute|pp=359–360}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with Gérôme's ''[[The Snake Charmer]]'', ''The Slave Market'' has become an iconic example of 19th-century [[Orientalism|orientalist]] art.&lt;ref name="lees" /&gt;

==Reception==
[[Maxime Du Camp]], who had travelled extensively in the Near East, reviewed the painting from the 1867 Salon. He located the motif to Cairo's slave market and described the painting as "a scene done on the spot".&lt;ref name="lees" /&gt; Du Camp wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;It is one of these [more expensive] women, an Abyssinian, that M. Gérôme has taken as the principal figure of his composition. She is nude and being displayed by the djellab, who has the fine head of a brigand accustomed to every sort of abduction and violence; the idea of the eternal soul must not very often have tormented such a bandit. The poor girl is standing, submissive, humble, resigned, with a fatalistic passivity that the painter has very skillfully rendered.&lt;ref name="lees" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Gender and Sexuality ==
In an art historical context, [[Harem]] scenes depicted domestic spaces for the women in the Muslim societies, the males were only included in barbaric and sexual relations. This painting presents an unspecific Middle Eastern or North African setting in which a man inspects the teeth of a nude, female slave. Women were depicted with a passive sexuality, while the men were depicted as violent and disrespectful towards women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ali|first=Isra|year=2015|title=The harem fantasy in nineteenth-century Orientalist paintings|journal=Dialectical Anthropology|volume=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''"Torna a Surriento"''' ({{IPA-nap|ˈtɔrn a ssurˈrjendə|pron}}) is a [[Neapolitan song]] composed in 1902 by Italian musician [[Ernesto De Curtis]] to words by his brother, the poet and painter [[Giambattista De Curtis]]. The song was copyrighted officially in 1905, and has become one of the most popular songs of this traditional genre, which include others such as [[O sole mio]], [[Funiculì funiculà]], and [[Santa Lucia]].

"Torna a Surriento" has been sung by performers as diverse as [[Frank Sinatra]], [[Beniamino Gigli]], [[Elvis Presley]], [[Dean Martin]], [[Jerry Vale]], [[Enrico Caruso]], [[José Carreras]], [[Plácido Domingo]], [[Luciano Pavarotti]], [[Ruggero Raimondi]], [[Meat Loaf]], [[Mario Lanza]], [[Franco Corelli]],[[Nino Martini]] &lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/78_torna-a-sorriento-come-back-to-sorrento_nino-martini-de-curtis-alfredo-antonini_gbia0044988b/Torna+a+Sorriento+(Come+Back+to+Sorrento)+-+Nino+Martini.flac ''Torna a Surriento'' as sung by Nino Martini with conductor Alfredo Antonini on archive.org]&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Robertino Loreti]],  [[Giuseppe Di Stefano]], [[Muslim Magomayev (musician)|Muslim Magomayev]], [[Francesco Albanese]], [[Jerry Adriani]], [[Roberto Carlos (singer)|Roberto Carlos]], [[Alfie Boe]],  [[Anna Calvi]], [[Karel Gott]],[[IlVolo]] and [[Norton Buffalo]] with [[George Kahumoku, Jr.]]; [[Sergio Franchi]] covered the song in his 1962 RCA Victor Red Seal debut album, (''Romantic Italian Songs''), which peaked at #17 on the [[Billboard Top 200]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.discogs.com Sergio Franchi&lt;/ref&gt; Not forgetting the comedic version by [[Billy Connolly]], "Saltcoats at the fair"

[[Claude Aveling]] wrote the English language lyrics, which are titled "'''Come Back to Sorrento'''". [[Doc Pomus]] and [[Mort Shuman]] re-arranged it and wrote a new set of lyrics for Elvis Presley ("[[Surrender (Elvis Presley song)|Surrender]]").

In the television show ''[[The Honeymooners]]'', Ralph Kramden identifies the song in preparing for his appearance on a quiz show called "The $99,000 Answer." He mistakenly identifies it as "Take Me Back to Sorrento" and says it was written by "Ernesto Dequista," which his friend Ed Norton says is "absolutely correct."

== History ==
Tradition holds that the origin of the song dates to 1902, when Guglielmo Tramontano, mayor of [[Sorrento]] asked his friend Giambattista De Curtis to write the song for the [[prime minister of Italy|Prime Minister]] [[Giuseppe Zanardelli]], then vacationing at his seaside hotel, the [[Villa Strongoli, Sorrento|Imperial Hotel Tramontano]]; it was claimed that the piece was meant to celebrate Zanardelli's stay.


Some claim the song is a plea to Zanardelli to keep his promise to help the impoverished city of Sorrento, which was especially in need of a sewage system. The song reflects the beauty of the city's great surroundings and the love and passion of its citizens.

More recent research indicates that the song may merely have been reworked for the occasion; family papers indicate that the brothers deposited a copy with the [[Italian Society of Authors and Editors]] in 1894, eight years before they claimed to have written it.

== Neapolitan lyrics ("Torna a Surriento") ==

:Vide 'o mare quant’è bello,
:spira tantu sentimento,
:Comme tu a chi tieni mente,
:Ca scetato 'o fai sunnà.

:Guarda gua' chistu ciardino;
:Siente, sie’ sti ciur' arance:
:Nu prufumo accussi fino
:Dinto 'o core se ne va…

:E tu dice: "I’ parto, addio!"
:T’alluntane da stu core…
:Da sta terra del l’ammore…
:Tieni 'o core 'e nun turnà?

:Ma nun me lassà,
:Nun darme stu turmiento!
:Torna a Surriento,
:Famme campà!

:Vid'o mare de Surriento,
:che tesoro tene nfunno:
:chi ha girato tutto 'o munno
:nun l'ha visto comme'a ccà.

:Vide attuorno sti Sirene,
:ca te guardano 'ncantate,
:e te vonno tantu bene...
:Te vulessero vasà.

:E tu dice: "I' parto, addio!"
:T'alluntane da stu core

==English translation ("Come Back to Sorrento")==

:Look at the sea, how beautiful it is,
:it inspires so many emotions,
:like you do with the people you look at,
:who you make to dream while they are still awake.

:Look at this garden
:and the scent of these oranges,
:such a fine perfume,
:it goes straight into your heart,

:And you say: "I am leaving, goodbye."
:You go away from this heart of mine,
:away from this land of love,
:And you have the heart not to come back.

:But do not go away,
:do not give me this pain.
:Come back to Surriento,
:let me live!

:Look at the sea of Surriento,
:what a treasure it is!
:Even who has travelled all over the world,
:he has never seen a sea like this one.

:Look at these mermaids
:that stare, amazed, at you,
:that love you so much.
:They would like to kiss you,

:And you say: "I am leaving, goodbye."
:You go away from my heart,
:away from the land of love,
:And you have the heart not to come back.

:But please do not go away,
:do not give me this pain.
:Come back to Surriento,
:let me live!

[[File:0 Vertumne et Pomone - Peter Paul Rubens (1617-1619).JPG|thumb|279px|''Vertumnus and Pomona'' (c. 1618) by [[Peter Paul Rubens]]]]

In [[Roman mythology]], '''Vertumnus'''  ({{IPA-la|ˈwɛr.tʊm.nʊs|}}; also ''Vortumnus'' or ''Vertimnus'') is the god of seasons, change&lt;ref&gt;" Vertumnus then, that turn'st the year about," ([[Thomas Nashe]], ''Summer's Last Will and Testament'' (1592, printed 1600)).&lt;/ref&gt; and plant growth, as well as gardens and fruit trees.  He could change his form at will; using this power, according to [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' (xiv), he tricked [[Pomona (mythology)|Pomona]] into talking to him by disguising himself as an old woman and gaining entry to her [[orchard]], then using a narrative warning of the dangers of rejecting a suitor (the embedded tale of [[Iphis]] and [[Anaxarete]]) to seduce her. The tale of Vertumnus and Pomona has been called the only purely Latin tale in Ovid's ''[[Metamorphoses]]''.&lt;ref&gt;it is called the first purely Latin tale by Charles Fantazzi, "The revindication of Roman myth in the Pomona-Vertumnus tale",  in N. Barbu ''et al.'', eds. ''Ovidianum'' (Bucharest, 1976:288, as Roxanne Gentilcore noticed, in "The Landscape of desire: the tale of Pomona and Vertumnus in Ovid's 'Metamorphoses'", ''Phoenix'' '''49'''.2 (Summer 1995:110-120) p. 110 ("It has also been called the first exclusively Latin tale") and note 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Vertumnus' [[Roman festivals|festival]] was called the '''Vertumnalia''' and was held 13 August.&lt;ref&gt;Ovid, ''[[Fasti (poem)|Fasti]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cult and origin==
[[Image:Luca Giordano 026.jpg|thumb|''Vertumnus and Pomona'' (1682–1683) by [[Luca Giordano]]]]

The name ''Vortumnus'' most likely derives from Etruscan ''[[Voltumna]]''. Its formation in Latin was probably influenced by the Latin verb ''vertēre'' meaning "to change", hence the alternative form ''Vertumnus''. Ancient etymologies were based on often superficial similarities of sound rather than the principles of modern scientific linguistics, but reflect ancient interpretations of a deity's function.&lt;ref&gt;Eytmology in Propertius, ''Elegy'' 4; commentary by L. Richardson Jr. (1977), noting that the etymology is not [[classical philology|philologically]] sound.&lt;/ref&gt; In writing about the [[Vestalia|Festival of Vesta]] in his poem on the [[Roman calendar]], Ovid recalls a time when the forum was still a reedy swamp and "that god, Vertumnus, whose name fits many forms, / Wasn’t yet so-called from damming back the river" (''averso amne'').&lt;ref&gt;Ovid, ''Fasti'', Book 6, June 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Marcus Terentius Varro|Varro]] was convinced that Vortumnus was Etruscan, and a major god.&lt;ref&gt;Varro, ''De lingua latina'' V.46: ''"Ab eis [the Etruscans] dictus Vicus Tuscus, et ideo ibi Vortumnum stare, quod is deus Etruriae princeps"''&lt;/ref&gt; Vertumnus' cult arrived in [[Rome, Italy|Rome]] around 300 BC, and a temple to him was constructed on the [[Aventine Hill]] by 264 BC, the date when Volsinii (Etruscan Velzna) fell to the Romans. [[Sextus Propertius|Propertius]], the major literary source for the god, also asserts that the god was Etruscan, and came from [[Volsinii]].

[[File:Porträtt, Rudolf II som Vertumnus. Guiseppe Arcimboldo - Skoklosters slott - 87582.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The painting ''[[Vertumnus (painting)|Vertumnus]]'' (ca. 1590) by [[Giuseppe Arcimboldo]] depicts [[Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor|Rudolf II]] as Vertumnus''.]]
Propertius refers to a bronze statue of Vortumnus&lt;ref&gt;Propertius, ''Elegy'' 4.2.41-46&lt;/ref&gt; made by the legendary [[Mamurius Veturius]], who was also credited with the twelve ritual shields ''([[ancile|ancilia]])'' of [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]]' priests the [[Salii]]. The bronze statue replaced an ancient [[maple]] statue ''([[xoanon]])'' supposed to have been brought to Rome in the time of [[Romulus]].&lt;ref&gt;Daniel P. Harmon, "Religion in the Latin Elegists", ''Aufstieg und Niedergang der römischen Welt'' 2.16.3 (1986), pp. 1960–61; W.A. Camps, ''Propertius: Elegies Book IV'' (Cambridge University Press, 1968), p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt; The statue of Vortumnus ''(signum Vortumni)'' stood in a simple shrine located at the [[Vicus Tuscus]] near the [[Forum Romanum]],&lt;ref&gt;Michael C. J. Putnam, "The Shrine of Vortumnus" ''American Journal of Archaeology'' vol&amp;nbsp;'''71''', &amp;nbsp;2, pp&amp;nbsp;177-179 (April 1967).&lt;/ref&gt; and was decorated according to the changing seasons. In his poem about the god, Propertius has the statue of Vortumnus speak in first-person as if to a passer-by.&lt;ref&gt;E. C. Marquis (1974) "Vertumnus in Propertius 4, 2". ''Hermes'', vol&amp;nbsp;'''102''', no&amp;nbsp;3, pp&amp;nbsp;491-500.&lt;/ref&gt;

The base of the statue was discovered in 1549, perhaps still ''in situ'', but has since been lost. An inscription&lt;ref&gt;''[[Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum|CIL]]'' VI.1.804: VORTUMNUS TEMPORIBUS DIOCLETIANI ET MAXIMIANI&lt;/ref&gt; commemorated  a restoration to the statue under [[Diocletian]] and [[Maximian]] in the early 4th&amp;nbsp;century&amp;nbsp;[[AD]].&lt;ref&gt;R. Lanciani (1903) ''Storia degli scavi di Roma'' vol. II, p. 204f.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classical tradition==
[[Image:Vertumnus Pomona Lemoyne Louvre RF2716.jpg|thumb|A [[rococo]] ''Vertumne et Pomone'' (1760) by [[Jean-Baptiste Lemoyne]]]]

The subject of ''Vertumnus and Pomona'' appealed to European sculptors and painters of the 16th through the 18th centuries, providing a disguised erotic subtext in a scenario that contrasted youthful female beauty with an aged [[crone]]. In narrating the tale in the ''[[Metamorphoses]]'', Ovid had observed that the kind of kisses given by Vertumnus were never given by an old woman:&lt;ref&gt;''Qualia numquam vera dedisset anus''&lt;/ref&gt; "so [[Circe]]'s smile conceals a wicked intention, and Vertumnus' hot kisses ill suit an old woman's disguise".&lt;ref&gt;Donald Lateiner (1996) "Nonverbal Behaviors in Ovid's Poetry, Primarily ''Metamorphoses'' 14", ''The Classical Journal'', vol&amp;nbsp;'''91''' no&amp;nbsp;3, pp&amp;nbsp;225-253 (February–March 1996).&lt;/ref&gt;

The subject was even woven into [[tapestry]] in series with the generic theme ''Loves of the Gods'', of which the mid-16th-century [[Brussels tapestry]] at [[Museu Calouste Gulbenkian]], Lisbon, woven to cartoons attributed to [[Jan Vermeyen]], must be among the earliest. [[François Boucher]] provided designs for the tapestry-weaver Maurice Jacques at the [[Gobelins manufactory|Gobelins tapestry manufactory]] for a series that included ''Vertumnus and Pomona'' (1775–1778). A similar theme of erotic disguise is found with ''Jupiter wooing [[Callisto (mythology)|Callisto]] in the guise of Diana'', an example of which is at the [[J. Paul Getty Museum]].

[[Image:Vertumnus and Pomona-Summer Garden-Saint Petersburg.jpg|thumb|''Vertumnus'' and ''[[Pomona (mythology)|Pomona]]'' (1717) by [[Francesco Penso]], in an [[Avenue (landscape)|allée]] of the Summer Garden, St. Petersburg]]
[[Mme de Pompadour]], who sang well and danced gracefully, played the role of ''Pomone'' in a [[pastoral]] presented to a small audience at [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]];&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.threeweb.ad.jp/~nityshr/fronbun/dvpastoral.htm "Pourquoi ''[[Le Devin du Village]]'' est un pastorale?"]{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; the sculpture by [[Jean-Baptiste Lemoyne]] (1760) alludes to the event. 
&lt;!--the Pompadour Pomone reference should be checked against Philippe Beaussant, ''Les plaisirs de Versailles, théâtre et musique'' Chapter III, "Le théâtre de la Pompadour" Fayard, 1996.--&gt;

[[Camille Claudel]] sculpted a sensual marble version of "Vertumnus and Pomona" in 1905 (Musée Rodin, Paris).

[[Joseph Brodsky]] wrote a poem about Vertumnus.

==Modern interpretations==
David Littlefield finds in the episode a movement from [[rape]] to mutual desire, effected against an orderly, "civilised" [[Latium|Latian]] landscape&lt;ref&gt;David Littlefield (1965) "Pomona and Vertumnus: a fruition of history in Ovid's ''Metamorphoses''" ''Arion'' vol&amp;nbsp;'''4''', p&amp;nbsp;470.&lt;/ref&gt;

Conversely, Roxanne Gentilcore reads in its diction and narrative strategies images of deception, veiled threat and seduction, in which Pomona, the tamed [[hamadryad]] now embodying the orchard, does not have a voice.&lt;ref&gt;Roxanne Gentilcore (1995) "The Landscape of Desire: The Tale of Pomona and Vertumnus in Ovid's 'Metamorphoses'" ''Phoenix'' vol&amp;nbsp;'''49''', no&amp;nbsp;2, pp&amp;nbsp;110-120 (Summer 1995).&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="48491">{{Culture of Vietnam}}
'''Vietnamese art'''  is [[visual art]] that, whether ancient or modern, originated in or is practiced in Vietnam or by Vietnamese artists.

==Introduction==
Vietnamese art has a long and rich history, the earliest examples of which date back as far as the [[Stone Age]] around 8,000 [[BCE]] &lt;ref name="vietnamese art artists history"&gt;{{cite web|publisher= widewalls|title=vietnamese art artists history|url= https://www.widewalls.ch/vietnamese-art-artists-history/    }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

With the millennium of [[History of Vietnam|Chinese domination]] starting in the 2nd century BC, Vietnamese art undoubtedly absorbed many Chinese influences, which would continue even following independence from China in the 10th century AD.  However, Vietnamese art has always retained many distinctively Vietnamese characteristics.

By the 19th century, the influence of [[French art]] took hold in Vietnam, having a large hand in the birth of modern Vietnamese art.

==Vietnamese art throughout the ages==

===Neolithic art===
[[File:Gom1.JPG|thumb|right|300px|Terracotta pieces used to imprint decoration patterns on cloth]]
Pottery dating to the [[Stone Age]] [[(c. 8000 BCE)]] has been found in Bac Son, Vietnam.  This pottery was made from clay, and in its beginnings was largely basic and lacking any artistic flare.  Moving into the neolithic era, however, [[Vietnamese pottery]] and ceramics started to develop rapidly, showing signs of decor.

===Bronze Age art===

The highly developed [[Đông Sơn culture]] that flourished in [[North Vietnam]] (from about 1000 BC to the 4th century BC) was the civilization responsible for the world-famous [[Đông Sơn drums]], a product of their advanced bronze-casting skills.

These drums give us an important peek into early Vietnamese life.  They were elaborately decorated with [[geometric patterns]], and most importantly, depicted scenes of everyday life such as farming, warriors donning feather headdresses, construction of ships, musicians, etc.

Archaeological evidence from this period also shows that people in the area had long been weaving cloth.  Many of the people depicted on the drums are shown as wearing elaborate clothing.

===Chinese domination from 111 BC to 939 AD===
During the ten centuries of rule by the Chinese, Vietnamese began to apply newly learned Chinese techniques to art and specifically ceramics, however this was in conjunction with the continued production of art based on native methods; this is proven by excavation of Chinese tombs in the area.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vietnamartbooks.com/articles/article.html?id=67 Pottery and ceramics during Chinese rule&lt;/ref&gt;

===From the Ngô to Trần Dynasty===

Vietnamese art and ceramics during this period of independence (approximately 10th to 15th centuries) flourished.  The ceramics from this period were thought to have been largely influenced by both ancient native styles and the [[Tang Dynasty|Tang]] and later [[Song Dynasty]]'s art, including applying the "three colors" concept to its ceramics.  Chinese-influenced philosophies adopted by the Vietnamese such as [[Confucianism]], [[Mahayana Buddhism]] and [[Taoism]] all had a lasting impression on Vietnamese art. Some also claim there are small traces of [[Art of Champa|Cham]] influences to be found as well.

The [[Lý Dynasty]], beginning in the 11th century is viewed specifically as the golden age of Vietnamese art, and its ceramics became famous across East and Southeast Asia.  The Lý Dynasty also saw the construction of many of Vietnam's landmark structures, including the [[Temple of Literature, Hanoi|Temple of Literature]], One-pillar pagoda, and Quynh Lam pagoda.  The [[Trần Dynasty]] that immediately followed in the 13th century saw a more subdued approach to art.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://english.vietnamnet.vn/lifestyle/2005/10/501151/ |title=VietNamNet Bridge&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; |access-date=2007-04-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070504205207/http://english.vietnamnet.vn/lifestyle/2005/10/501151/ |archive-date=2007-05-04 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fourth Chinese domination and Lê Dynasty===
[[File:DoGo.JPG|thumb|right|300px|Pieces of wooden art from 17th and 18th century]]
The [[fourth Chinese domination of Vietnam]] was quite short-lived, lasting only about 2 decades, yet it was also seen as the harshest domination.  Many if not most classical Vietnamese books were burnt, and thus much documentation of the era of independence lost.  It is said that a more extreme than-ever process of [[sinicization]] was enforced, and countless Vietnamese resources and goods were removed and taken to China.

Consequently, much of the art in this period and even after liberation by the [[Lê Dynasty]] was heavily influenced by the [[Ming Dynasty]]'s art.

====Nguyễn Dynasty====
The [[Nguyễn Dynasty]], the last ruling dynasty of Vietnam, saw a renewed interest in ceramics and porcelain art.  Imperial courts across Asia imported Vietnamese ceramics.

Despite how highly developed the performing arts (such as imperial court music and dance) became during the Nguyễn Dynasty, some view other fields of arts as beginning to decline during the latter part of the Nguyễn Dynasty.

==Modern art==
Vietnam Modern Art includes artistic work materialized during colonial period between 1860s to 1970s, and significantly ascribed to the founding of “[[École Supérieure des Beaux-Arts de L'Indochine|Ecole Supérieure des Beaux-Arts de l'Indochine]]” in October 1925.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Viet Nam Plastic and Visual Arts from 1925 to Our Time|last=|first=|publisher=|year=1998|isbn=|location=Esapce Méridien|pages=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before 1925, paintings and carvings were mainly created for religious purpose, in a decorative manner for example lacquered furniture and utilitarian ceramic and porcelains, subordinated to demands by the local temples and pagodas use.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A striking “shift” was obvious after the founding of [[Ecole des Beaux-Arts de l'Indochine|Ecole des Beaux-Arts de l'Indohine]] EBAI, observing a gradual change in perception of art, and the beginning recognition of art for art’s sake.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Essays on Modern and Contemporary Vietnamese Art|last=|first=|publisher=Singapore Art Museum for Symposium on modern and contemporary Vietnamese art|year=2008|isbn=|location=Singapore|pages=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vietnamese artists experimented with new ways of seeing, with ideas from 2 important French teachers, it marks an intensifying [[Cultural transformation theory|cultural transfer]] and [[modernity]].  

=== The Colonial Period 1925 - 1945 ===
[[File:Xã-Xệ et Lý-Toét.jpg|thumb|An cartoon illustrated in Phong Hoa|alt=|left]]
[[Ecole des Beaux-Arts de l'Indochine|Ecole des Beaux-Arts de l'Indohine]] EBAI was founder by [[Victor Tardieu]], a French academic and naturalist painter.&lt;ref&gt;ibid, p5&lt;/ref&gt; With a report commission sent to the general Government of Indochina, Victor Tardieu recommended setting up a school “EBAI in Indochina” to train real artists.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Vietnam Plastic and Visual Art from 1925 to Our Time|last=|first=|publisher=Espace Méridien|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike, Ecole professionnelle” in Hanoi, “Ecole des Arts Cambodgeins”  and other three schools set up in Cochinchina between 1902 – 1913 these schools were professional schools to train craftsmen.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Tardieu’s idea was to adapt exiting curriculum used in “Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris” by including art history; technical course like oil painting and perspective, to train student into real artist.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; He planned to “help the Vietnamese artist to get back in touch with the deep meaning and fundamental inspiration of their own traditions”.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Vietnam Plastic and Visual Arts from 1925 to Our Time|last=|first=|publisher=Espace Méridien|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ngay Nay (Nowadays) Phong Hoa (mores) which was associated with Tu Luc Vaan Doan (Self Reliance Literary Association), were committed to modernising Vietnamese culture through the crucial assessment of both Vietnam's tradition and Western modernity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A City that remembers in the making of modern vietnam|last=Nguyen|first=Van Ky|publisher=|year=2004|isbn=|location=|pages=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;Students in the EBAI were columnist in this 2 weekly magazines, illustrating cartoons and exhibition information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Essays on Modern and Contemporary Vietnamese Art|last=Scott|first=Phoebe|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stylized cartoon illustration were in fact very modern, depicting simple messages.

===== Oil Painting =====
[[File:Hai thieu nu va em be.JPG|thumb|To Ngoc Van, Deux Jeunes filles et un enfants, 1944, oil on canvas, Museum of Fine Arts, Hanoi|alt=|270x270px]]
Following closely to the curriculum of [[École des Beaux-Arts de Paris|Ecole des Beaux-Arts de Paris]], oil painting was first introduced to students as a completely new medium.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Essays on Modern and Contemporary Vietnamese Art|last=|first=|publisher=Singapore Art Museum for symposium on modern and contemporary Vietnamese art|year=2008|isbn=|location=Singapore|pages=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although western art, in this case, oil painting, was likely first encountered by Le Van Mien (1873-1943) in L’Ecole Nationale Superieure des Beaux- Arts de Paris, who returned to Hanoi in 1895, no record shows that he taught and trained craftsman in Bien Hoa or Gia Dinh this western medium.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Post Dôi Mói Vietnamese Art After 1990|last=|first=|publisher=Singapore Art Museum for the exhibition Post-Doi Moi: Vietnamese Art after 1990|year=2008|isbn=|location=|pages=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; This medium was thoroughly unknown to the students, and [[Joseph Inguimberty]] though it would be hard to assimilate the oil painting techniques to them.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; 
Artist like [[Tô Ngọc Vân|To Ngoc Van]] was able to combine western aesthetic techniques like linear perspective, imitation of nature and modelling in the round into his own oriental traditions with oil medium.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Stylized as the ‘poetic reality’ style, his works sets female ideals into a linear perspective in an enclosed space, juxtapositioned with flat coloured area, his works emulates with the tendency idealization imagery.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

===== En Plein Air =====

Similarly, en plein air was another major practice instituted in EBAI’s curriculum.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Essays on Modern and Contemporary Vietnamese Art|last=|first=|publisher=Singapore Art Museum for symposium on modern and contemporary Vietnamese art|year=2008|isbn=|location=|pages=55}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Students were brought outdoor for field trips to develop their painting sense of the environment. As noted by art historian Nora Taylor, &lt;blockquote&gt;“[He … propped his easel under a tree by rice paddy, took off his shirt and proceeded to sketch farmers planting their rice seedlings. Needless to say he earned quite a few giggles and embarrassed glances from his subjects.’ Nobody took off their shirts in public, not even the farmers in the fields. The French did and so did [[Tô Ngọc Vân|To Ngoc Van]].”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Taylor|first=Nora|date=1997|title=The Artist and the state|url=|journal=The Politics of painting and National Identity in Hanoi, Vietnam 1925 - 1999|volume=|pages=50|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt;  &lt;/blockquote&gt;This example quoted by Taylor, argues that the tendency of idealization, we see in To Nga Van’s painting reflects a distancing and detachment with the subject matter, a result of artist’s attempt to emulate their French teachers inclusive of whatever they do.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;
Other than oil medium and en plein air painting method, significant assimilation and adaption of local culture were encouraged by [[Victor Tardieu]] and his successor [[Joseph Inguimberty|Joseph Imguimberty]]. 

==== Lacquer Painting ====
[[File:Confucius - Temple of Literature, Hanoi - DSC04635.JPG|thumb|Interior of Temple of Literature|alt=|left]]
[[File:Confucius - Temple of Literature, Hanoi - DSC04600.JPG|thumb|The wares placed on altar were lacquered wares that inspired Joseph Imguimberty to plan a workshop for lacquer painting the studenst in EBAI|alt=]]
[[Joseph Inguimberty|Joseph Imguimberty]] was fascinated by the lacquered cultural objects and architecture fixtures after visiting the [[Temple of Literature, Hanoi|Temple of Literature]] in Hanoi.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Post Dôi Mói Vietnamese Art After 1990|last=|first=|publisher=Singapore Art Museum for the exhibition Post-Doi Moi: Vietnamese Art after 1990|year=2008|isbn=|location=|pages=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; He encouraged his students to start using lacquer as a fine art medium, and set up workshops in EBAI with old artisans, playing an renaissance role in Lacquer painting. &lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;“falling back on the past will be efficient only if it is used as a starting point for a new research, for an evolution in line with the contemporary eras; to summarise, the question is to evolve as contemporaries within an extensive of tradition.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Vietnam Plastic and Visual Arts from 1925 to Out Time|last=|first=|publisher=Espace Méridien|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;''[[Victor Tardieu]]''&lt;/blockquote&gt;[[File:Nguyen Gia Tri Women in the Garden.jpg|alt=|left|thumb|303.993x303.993px|Lacquer painting by Nguyen Gia Tri shows distinctive french influence of "romantic realism" style, yet a blend of localized culture iconography within the work]]
Making lacquer painting takes several months, using resin from Son tree taken from the plantation from [[Sơn mài|Son Mai]] region, numerous layers of application are applied to acquire the desired colour and effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Post Dôi Mói Vietnamese Art After 1990|last=|first=|publisher=Singapore Art Museum for the exhibition Post-Doi Moi: Vietnamese Art after 1990|year=2008|isbn=|location=|pages=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most notable artist who excelled in this medium is [[Nguyễn Gia Trí|Nguyen Gia Tri]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Although artists like [[Trần Quang Trân|Tran Quang Tran]], [[Lê Phổ|Le Pho]], Phan Hau, [[Nguyễn Khang (painter)|Nguyen Khang]] and Nguyen Van Que attempted lacquer painting, [[Nguyễn Gia Trí|Nguyen Gia Tri]]'s achievement in lacquer painting is remarkable for his research on pigments and exploration of new lacquer colours.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Essays on Modern and Contemporary Vietnamese Art|last=|first=|publisher=Singapore Art Museum for symposium on modern and contemporary Vietnamese art|year=2008|isbn=|location=|pages=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nguyen Gia Tri's aim “ was to obtain the same level of painting as with the oil medium regarding perspective, modelling in the round, and infinite variation of colours”.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; 

==== Silk Painting ====
[[File:Le Pho Maternity.jpg|thumb|Le Pho silk painting styled closely similar to a classic "Madonna nursing baby" triangle composition]]
Other artists like [[Nguyễn Phan Chánh|Nguyen Phanh Chanh]], [[Lê Phổ|Le Pho]], [[Mai Thứ|Mai Trung Thu]], [[Trần Văn Cẩn|Tan Van Can]], [[Lê Văn Đệ|Le Van De]],  who were the first batch of students to be admitted in EBAI, are most notable for their silk painting.&lt;ref&gt;ibid, pg 8&lt;/ref&gt;

Like lacquer painting, silk painting was much encouraged for exploration in the school. Different from similar practice of silk painting in China and Japan, an intensifying of cultural transfer was observed in Vietnamese silk painting, artist like [[Nguyễn Phan Chánh|Nguyen Phan Chan]] blended western composition principle with eastern tradition like calligraphy and brush paintings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Vietnam Plastic and Visual Arts from 1925 to Our Time|last=|first=|publisher=Espace Méridien|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Choi o an quan-Nguyen Phan Chanh.jpg|left|thumb|269.983x269.983px|Choi o an quan (Mandarin square) Children Playing a Game of Squares]]
In 1931, Paris International Colonial Exhibition, [[Nguyễn Phan Chánh|Nguyen Phan Chan]]’s work titled ''Children Playing a Game of Squares'' was well-received and this recognition firmly established the medium as a modern Vietnamese expression.

Between 1930 – 1936, Nguyen Phan Chan, Le Pho, Mai Trung Thu and Nguyen Gia Tri, graduated from EBAI. Victor Tardieu passed away in 1937 and he was took after by [[Évariste Jonchère|Evariste Jonchere]]. [[Tô Ngọc Vân|To Ngoc Van]] begin teaching in EBAI in 1937. Artists like Bui Xuan Phai and Nguyen Tu Nghiem who entered EBAI in 1941 was unable to complete the full five-year programme due to the 1945 revolution.

A bombing of Hanoi that was intended for Japanese target destroyed part of the EBAI painting department in 1943, resulting the sculpture department to be moved to Son Tay; Architecture and sculpture department to Dalat while applied arts went to Phu Ly.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Post Dôi Mói Vietnamese Art After 1990|last=|first=|publisher=Singapore Art Museum for the exhibition Post-Doi Moi: Vietnamese Art after 1990|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Time of Resistance wars 1945 - 1975 ===
Resistance war uproar marks the official close down of EBAI in 1945. Democratic Republic of Vietnam reopened a fine arts school in Hanoi for a short period of time in September 1945 ruled by To Ngoc Van. However, artist were sympathetic of the Viet Minh and decided to leave Hanoi to join the resistance movement against French in the Hills of [[Northwest (Vietnam)|Tay Bac]]. &lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; 

==== Artists in the North ====
Notable group of artists in the North during the Cold War were [[Tô Ngọc Vân]], [[Trần Văn Cẩn]], Huỳnh Phương Đong, Phạm Thanh Tâm, Minh Tuyen, Hoang Trung.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://cfa.nus.edu.sg/calendar/19-wwrw|title="Who Wants To Remember A War?" War Drawings And Posters From The Ambassador Dato’ N. Parameswaran Collection|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another small number of artists from well-to-do backgrounds had the opportunity to go to France and make their careers there for the most part.&lt;ref name="vcw"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ngoc|first=Huu|year=2000|title=Modern Painting: Tracing the Roots|url=http://www.thegioipublishers.com.vn/en/magazines/detail.php?cat=1&amp;idmagazines=267|dead-url=yes|journal=Vietnam Cultural Window|publisher=Thế Giới Publishers|volume=29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306013739/http://www.thegioipublishers.com.vn/en/magazines/detail.php?cat=1&amp;idmagazines=267|archive-date=2012-03-06|accessdate=2010-04-23|df=}} [http://www.particulargallery.com/Articles/Articles5.aspx Full text available here]&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include Le Thi Luu, Le Pho, Mai Trung Thu, Le Van De, Le Ba Dang and Pham Tang.&lt;ref name="vcw" /&gt;

When Ho Chi Minh declared Vietnam’s independence in 2 September 1945,  Vietnamese artist begin to resist the influence of romantic realism, tendency for nostalgia past and melancholic dreams. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Vietnam Plastic and Visual Arts from 1925 to Our Time|last=|first=|publisher=Espace Méridien|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; Artist like [[Tô Ngọc Vân|To Ngoc Van]] shook off his romantic style and turned towards modern realism, he moved the closed EBAI (after the Japanese coup de force in March 1945) to Viet Bac in 1950, the military base of the Revolutionary Army under Ho Chi Minh.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Essays on Modern and Contemporary Vietnamese Art|last=|first=|publisher=Singapore Art Museum for symposium on modern and contemporary Vietnamese art|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=56}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;“[He]… decided that art, as the French saw it, died in 1945 when Viet Nam declared its independence and was reborn in 1946 when the Viet Minh moved the art school to the hills of Viet Bac, the seat of the revolutionary movement. In 1946, He declared proudly ‘tradition starts now.’” &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Taylor|first=Nora|date=1997|title=The Artist and the State|url=|journal=The Politics of Painting and National Identity in Hanoi, Vietnam 1925 - 75|volume=|pages=84|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[File:Hình ảnh Tô Ngọc Vân vẽ về cuộc di tản.jpg|thumb|To Ngoc Van's painting style changed drastically away from the usual ideal women he painted before the resistance war.]]
[[Tô Ngọc Vân|To Ngoc Van]] begin teaching resistance art classes in the Northern zone during the war with the French. This includes setting up the "School of Fine Arts in the Resistance Zone", and combating against decadent art being scientific, national and popular,  art have to abandon religion, mythical and idealists theme, focusing solely on the inspiration and needs of the revolution and being appealing and educational to a majority of people.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Hence artists like Nguyen Hiem, [[Nguyễn Sáng|Nguyen Sang]], Phan Van Don and [[Trần Văn Cẩn|Tran Van Can]] created works that depicted the countrysides, portraits of peasants, soldiers battles scenes, they uphold the belief that artist should show the reality of society instead of idealised imageries.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;
[[Tô Ngọc Vân|To Ngoc Van]] died in 1954 as the result of injuries received at the [[Battle of Dien Bien Phu]], School of Fine Arts in the Resistance Zone was later moved to Hanoi in 1955 and named as the “Vietnam College of Fine Arts” with [[Trần Văn Cẩn|Tran Van Can]] as the principal.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

[[File:Gap Nhau by Mai Van Hien.jpg|left|thumb|302.986x302.986px|'''Mai Van Hien, Meeting (Gap Nhau), gouache on paper, 1954''']]
First National Art Exhibition in the Democratic Republic of Vietna in 1955, after the victory at [[Battle of Dien Bien Phu|Dien Bein Phu]] where Meeting (Gap Nhau) by [[Mai Van Hien]] was praised as the ideal painting that illustrates the idea of community and solidarity between the soldiers and the common people.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; "The mood of the painting is reflected in the artist’s simple descriptive style, which lends itself well to its content."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Taylor|first=Nora|date=December 2011|title=Framing the National Spirit – Viewing and Reviewing Painting under the Revolution|url=|journal=http://www.vxartnews.com/2011/12/framing-the-national-spirit-viewing-and-reviewing-painting-under-the-revolution-part-2/|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;In a Painting Exhibition that in happened December 10, 1951, Ho Chi Minh sent a message to the artists that  "you, in the artistic field, have your own responsibilities - to serve the resistance, the Fatherland and the people, first and foremost the workers, peasants and soldiers,"&lt;ref&gt;Ho Chi Minh, “Message sent to the artists on the occasion of the 1951 Paintings Exhibition (December 10, 1951)”, Selected Works of Ho Chi Minh Vol. 3, Publisher: Foreign Languages Publishing House. Reproduced on &lt;nowiki&gt;https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/ho-chi-minh/works/1951/12/10.htm&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;However, various debates erupted in Hanoi on the role of artists in Society in 1956, during the first meeting of the writers and artist associations, members demanded for greater freedom of expression which went against what Ho Chi Minh had earlier laid down. Two art and literature journals Nhan Van (humanism) and Gia Pham (Art Works) that supported the argument were subsequently banned. &lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

Following year, [[Vietnam Association of Fine Arts in Hanoi]] or National Arts Association was established with 108 member headed by Thai Ba Van. These members were required to be members of the association if they wished their works to be exhibited or sold. There were no private galleries where artists can displayed their work formally. Eventually, this association was governed with official rules and regulations, members are obligated to hold one exhibition at local level annually and another at national level every 5 years. Non members were not considered artist, hence they have no opportunity to display any form of art publicly.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Between 1950 to 70s, members were paid as “art workers” for the poster designs and illustrations, among few were elites who painted paintings for state visitors. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Essays on Modern and Contemporary Vietnamese Art|last=|first=|publisher=Singapore Art Museum for symposium on modern and contemporary Vietnamese art|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Realist style, which corresponded with Northern artists initial aspirations, was vital in the early days of revolution, however, due to the strict constraints by the DVR regime and decreasing subsidies, realist trend reached an apex in the 60s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Vietnam Plastic and Visual Arts from 1925 to Our Time|last=|first=|publisher=Espace Méridien|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; Strict guidelines were attempted to established in 1962, on the productions of artists artworks, they need to portray a "National Character", subject matters were usually the countryside, battle scene, portrait of Uncle Ho.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

==== National Paintings ====
Anti-colonial and resistance war culminated the appropriation of “national” art. It was a period to essentially erase the impact and influence of the French. Works painted by [[Nam Sơn|Nam Son]], Tran Van Can, Nguyen Sang, Tran Dong Luon were in fact in the medium Lacquer, silk and oil medium. The 3 media, encouraged and culturally transferred by the French during colonial period were renamed as “national”.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;
[[File:Tran Van Can - Painting 2.jpg|thumb]]
[[File:Female Militia in the Sea Tran Van Can.jpg|left|thumb|Female Militia in the Sea 1960 Tran Van Can]]
In [[Trần Văn Cẩn|Tran Van Can]]’s Portrait painting “''Militia women of a costal region''”, the artist depicted a robust figure and confronting gaze, she is a comrade ready to face the enemy. It is a politically correct painting, filled with characteristic that fulfills the national painting.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

Another theme commonly captured by artist was the landscape around Viet Bac. In the [[Diệp Minh Châu|Diep Minh Chau]]’s “Uncle Ho’s House in Viet Bac” show clear proficiency with the medium oil painting, the impressionist strokes of capturing the light through filtering leaves. 

In [[Duong Huong Minh]]’s “Hauling Up Canons” a work on lacquer captures dramatic scene of soldiers hauling heavy weapons up a steep slope. The bravery of the men eventually brought the Viet Minh their victory against the French in Bien Dien Phu.
[[File:Approaching Khe Sanh Pham Thanh Tam.jpg|left|thumb|Approaching Khe Sanh. A watercolour completed by Pham Thanh Tam in December 1967]]
Similarly, in watercolour painting painted by [[Pham Thanh Tam]] during resistance war ‘shows a clear French influence. His professors in the resistance zone were trained from the EBAI” the drawings and diary clearly contents “lyrical and poetic quality” it was regarded as ideal paintings.&lt;sup&gt;[21]&lt;/sup&gt;  

Hence, art curator Joyce Fan argues that “the realist techniques thus imparted by the French continue to manifest in the paintings with the sense of detachment and distancing, unlike the social realist use of emotive values to heighten the pathos in the imagery.”&lt;sup&gt;[22]&lt;/sup&gt; Likewise, the undeniable fact that, the intense cultural transfer during colonial period continues to influence local artist after the exit of the French. 

==== '''Propaganda Posters''' ====
[[File:South Vietnam propaganda poster.jpg|thumb|poster that depict the countryside]]
Propaganda poster painted during the period of “operation rolling thunder” in 1965 reflects a clear anti-colonial and anti-imperial messages. Likely inspired by the Soviet and Communist Chinese, they carried a political intention. Following strictly to the culture of new Vietnam in Ho Chi Minh’s concept, was to "stimulate intellectual and artistic creativity for art and cultural development".&lt;sup&gt;[23]&lt;/sup&gt;

“Culture is seen as a powerful motor of development, and cultural identity as a constant in the harmonious development of society and the individual.” &lt;sup&gt;[24]&lt;/sup&gt;

"images such as those presented in the propaganda posters and paintings of the time were key indicators of how the population was to perceive the environment, the government, and the future. the posters and paintings were sometimes the only voices the people heard, the only clues they had to knowing and how to respond."&lt;sup&gt;[25]&lt;/sup&gt;

==== '''Artists in the South''' ====
Vietnam was divided at the 17 parallel after the [[Geneva Conference (1954)|Geneva Conference]] in 1954 separating themselves into the Soviet and Chinese supported North against the Southern Republic reinforced by the United Stated of America. This divided Vietnam forced some artists to fled to Saigon and continue their practices in the republic of Vietnam, most notable artist is [[Tạ Tỵ|Ta Ty]], who " considerably bolstered the South’s artistic development in the following years and profoundly contributed to the foundation of the Young Artists Association in 1966, though he chose to remain anonymous in its list of founding members due to privacy reasons."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://artradarjournal.com/2015/10/09/5-artists-to-know-from-the-vietnamese-young-artists-association/|title=5 artists to know from the Vietnamese Young Artists Association|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Nguyen Gia Tri decided to move to Gia Dinh and eventually became the director for “[[Ecole des beaux-art in Gia Dinh]]" founded in 1954.&lt;sup&gt;[26]&lt;/sup&gt; Evident in their works, due to accessibility of information, their artworks were styled as western influenced, more eclectic, experimental, subjective and individualism. They enjoyed more freedom in the subject matters and exhibited freely until 1975.&lt;sup&gt;[27]&lt;/sup&gt;

In 1962, the first international Exhibition of Fine Arts of Saigon was held with 21 countries participating it. Southern artist encountered abstract painting for the first time. Following up, a second exhibition was planned for 1966, but unfortunately cancelled due to the increase intensity of the war. In 1966, Saigon Society of Young Artist (Hoi Hoa Si Tre Saigon) was founded campaigning to develop modern art, members include Nguyen Trung and Trinh Cung.&lt;sup&gt;[14]&lt;/sup&gt;

Between 1960s - 70s artists in Saigon experimented abstraction and other contemporary expressions. As noted by Vietnamese art historian Hyunh-Beattie, Southern artists did not readily accepted and took in American culture, which they deem as inferior to the French. Although Americans were heavily involved in Saigon, Beattie argues that little had influenced on the art scene in republic.

After the [[Reunification Day|reunification of Vietnam]], southern artists were sent for re-education in 1975.&lt;sup&gt;[14]&lt;/sup&gt; 

1976, Hanoi government merged Ho Chi Minh city and Gia Dinh National School for decorative Arts and the Saigon College of Fine Arts into Ho Chi Minh City Fine Arts College, and established Ho Chi Minh City branch of The Vietnam Association of Fine Arts.&lt;sup&gt;[14]&lt;/sup&gt;

=== '''The Period of Renewal from 1985''' ===
Artists benefited greater freedom of expression after the launch of Doi Moi Campaign. The establishment of open market allowed artist a greater outlet of creative expressions. &lt;sup&gt;[14]&lt;/sup&gt; 

However, Nguyen Quan who was elected into the executive committee of Vietnam Association of Fine Arts and holding position as the chief editor of the Association's Magazine My Thuat (Fine Arts) was removed from his position after organizing a workshop with 30 artist in Dai Lai, North of Hanoi in 1986.&lt;sup&gt;[28]&lt;/sup&gt; The workshop was not acceptable by authority for "the retreat not only promoted individual expression and art for art's sake, it also went against what the state had instituted over the past three decades in that it allowed for artists to explore their individuality rather than represent that collective sentiments of their community."&lt;sup&gt;[29]&lt;/sup&gt;

==Contemporary Art==
Nowadays, besides working with traditional material like oil, acrylic, lacquer on wood, the younger generation of Vietnamese artists have become very active in involving different forms of arts, such as installation, performance and video art with many of them attaining international recognition for their artworks and exhibitions worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;http://hyperallergic.com/181080/in-vietnam-contemplating-the-future-of-contemporary-art/&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Nha San Collective]] (formerly Nha San Studio) - established in 1998,  was the first artist-led, non-profit initiative to be run in Vietnam.&lt;ref&gt;http://theculturetrip.com/asia/vietnam/articles/the-most-influential-contemporary-art-spaces-in-vietnam/&lt;/ref&gt; Nha San studio nurtured the first generation of Vietnamese avant-garde artists emergent in the early 1990s

==Architecture==
It is believed that in prehistoric times, Vietnamese people lived in stilt-houses, as depicted on the bronze Dong Son drums.  Similar kinds of houses can still be found in Vietnam today.

When Chinese influence permeated Vietnam, [[Chinese architecture]] had a large influence on the basic structure of many types of Vietnamese buildings, mostly pagodas and temples, communal houses, houses of [[Mandarin (bureaucrat)|scholar-bureaucrats]], aristocracy, and imperial palaces and quarters.  Nevertheless, these structures combined both Chinese influences and native style.
With French colonization of Vietnam in the 19th century, many French-styled buildings were constructed, including villas, government buildings, opera houses, etc.  Many of these buildings still stand in Vietnam and are one of the clearest remnants of the [[French Indochina|French colonial legacy]].

Some of Vietnam's most notable architectural structures include:

*The [[Temple of Literature, Hanoi|Temple of Literature]] or (Văn Miếu): Located in [[Hanoi]], [[North Vietnam]].  It was constructed during the [[Lý Dynasty]] and dedicated to [[Confucius]] and his disciples.  It is a fine example of the elegance of Lý Dynasty architecture, although much if it is in need of repair.  The Temple of Literature is a series of courtyards, buildings and pavilions, the center of which houses the famed stone [[stele]]s.  These steles are placed on top of [[bixi (tortoise)|stone turtles]], and are inscribed with the names of doctorate candidates successful at the [[Imperial examination]].  Also within the temple lies the "Quốc Tử Giám" or National University, which functioned for approximately 700 years, from 1076 to 1779.
*[[Imperial City, Huế]]: During the reign of the [[Nguyễn Dynasty]], a new imperial citadel in [[Huế]] was built, largely based on the Chinese [[Forbidden City]] in [[Beijing]], and also called the [[Imperial City, Huế|Purple forbidden city]].  However, it still employed many obviously Vietnamese characteristics in its design.  Other imperial structures built much later, such as the outlying tomb of [[Khải Định]], used French architectural elements as well.  The tomb of [[Minh Mạng]] is often considered one of the most beautiful structures in the Huế area, situated near a vast lotus pond, its construction was not completed until after Minh Mạng's death.

The citadel formerly sprawled a vast estate, but during subsequent wars and conflicts, much of it has been destroyed and later turned into [[rice paddy|rice paddies]].  The remaining areas are currently being restored by [[UNESCO]].

*[[One Pillar Pagoda]]: The one pillar pagoda is one of the most ancient structures of [[Hanoi]], its design credited to Emperor Lý Thái Tổ.  The story goes that the emperor had longed for a son, and one day dreamed that the Goddess of Mercy was sitting on a lotus flower offering him a son. In grattitude and reverence of his dream he ordered construction of a small pagoda in the form of a lotus, overlooking a pond. The pagoda has been rebuilt countlessly due to it being destroyed and burnt in wars by opponents.
*[[Perfume Pagoda]] and the surrounding area:  The Perfume pagoda is an ancient structure in Ha Tay province, located specifically in Perfume mountain, and is the site for a yearly festival attended by hundreds of thousands of Vietnamese.  Most people reach the pagoda by taking an hour boat ride across the scenic river (passing the countryside scattered with smaller pagodas) before reaching the Perfume Pagoda itself.  Inside are a series of temples and structures, and a grotto with stairs leading to two paths: "Heaven's gate" and "Hell's gate".  Descending deep into the grotto one finds the Inner temple.

The beauty of the Perfume Pagoda and surrounding area have served as the subject in many Vietnamese poems.

==Calligraphy==
{{main|Vietnamese calligraphy}}
Calligraphy has had a long history in Vietnam, previously using [[Chinese characters]] along with [[chữ nôm]].  However, most modern Vietnamese calligraphy instead uses the Roman-character based [[quốc ngữ]], which has proven to be very popular.

In the past, with literacy in the old character-based writing systems of Vietnam being restricted to scholars and elites, calligraphy nevertheless still played an important part in Vietnamese life.  On special occasions such as the [[Tết|Lunar New Year]], people would go to the village teacher or scholar to make them a calligraphy hanging (often poetry, folk sayings or even single words).  People who could not read or write also often commissioned scholars to write prayers which they would burn at [[temple]] shrines.

==Visual arts==

===Silk painting===
[[File:Nguyen Trai.jpg|thumb|190px|left|The [[silk painting]] of [[Nguyễn Trãi]] (15th century)]]
Vietnamese [[silk painting]] is one of the most popular forms of art in Vietnam, favored for the mystical atmosphere that can be achieved with the medium.  During the 19th and 20th centuries, French influence was absorbed into Vietnamese art and the liberal and modern use of color especially began to differentiate Vietnamese silk paintings from their Chinese, Japanese and Korean counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asia-art.net/vietnam_silk.html Art of Vietnam&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Vietnamese silk paintings typically showcase the countryside, landscapes, pagodas, historical events or scenes of daily life.

===Woodblock prints===
[[File:Dong Ho painting - Ly Ngu vong nguyet.jpg|thumb|160px|right|Typical [[Vietnamese woodblock prints|Đông Hồ folk woodblock print]] of a carp]]
A folk art with a long history in Vietnam, [[Vietnamese woodblock prints]] have reached a level of popularity outside of Vietnam.&lt;ref&gt;Forbes, Andrew, and Henley, David: ''Vietnam Past and Present: The North'' (History and culture of Hanoi and Tonkin). Chiang Mai. Cognoscenti Books, 2012. ASIN: B006DCCM9Q.&lt;/ref&gt;  Organic materials are used to make the paint, which is used on wood and pressed on paper.  The process is repeated with different colors.

===Photography===
{{See also|Photography in Vietnam}}
Photographic technology was introduced to Vietnam in the mid 19th century by French and Chinese commercial photographers.&lt;ref name="NDP"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Nguyen |first1=Duc Hiep |last2=Takata |first2=Ellen |title=Photography in Vietnam from the End of the Nineteenth Century to the Start of the Twentieth |journal=Trans Asia Photography Review |date=2014 |volume=4 |issue=2 |page=1-35 |url=http://hdl.handle.net/2027/spo.7977573.0004.204 |accessdate=15 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since its introduction a diverse range of photography practices have emerged such as [[fine art photography]], [[documentary photography]], and [[landscape photography]]. The development of such practices have been accelerated following [[Đổi Mới]], that has resulted in a diversification of funding for artists and increased international exposure.&lt;ref name="Zhuang"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Zhuang |first1=Wubin |title="Vietnam" in Photography in Southeast Asia: A Survey |date=2016 |publisher=National University of Singapore Press |location=Singapore |isbn=978-981-4722-12-4 |page=271-313}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Performing arts==

===Traditional music===
{{main|Music of Vietnam}}
Traditional Vietnamese music is extremely diverse, consisting of many different styles varying from region to region.  Some of the most widely known genres include:

*[[Quan họ]]: A type of improvisational music, it is sung a cappella and has a longstanding tradition in Vietnam, used in courtship rituals.
*Imperial Court music:  Music performed in the Vietnamese court during feudalistic times.  When referring specifically to the "[[Nhã nhạc]]" form it includes court music from the [[Trần Dynasty]] on to the [[Nguyễn Dynasty]].  It features an array of instruments, featuring musicians and dancers adorned in elaborate garb.
*[[Ca trù]]: An ancient form of [[chamber music]] which originated in the imperial court.  It gradually came to be associated with a [[geisha]]-type of entertainment where talented female musicians entertained rich and powerful men, often scholars and [[Mandarin (bureaucrat)|bureaucrats]] who most enjoyed the genre.  It was condemned in the 20th century by the government, being tied falsely with [[prostitution]], but recently it has seen a revival as appreciation for its cultural significance has grown.  Vietnam has completed documents to have Ca tru recognized by [[UNESCO]] as a potential [[Intangible Cultural Heritage]].

===Traditional theatre===
[[File:Gánh hát Nam Định trong lễ Tứ tuần Đại khánh của Hoàng đế Khải Định (1924).jpg|thumb|300px|Tuong theatre actors.]]
Genres include:
*[[Cải lương]]: A kind of modern folk opera originating in [[South Vietnam]], which utilizes extensive [[vibrato]] techniques.  It remains very popular in modern Vietnam when compared to other folk styles.
*[[Hát chèo]]: The most mainstream of theatre/music forms in the past, enjoyed widely by the public rather than the more obscure Ca trù which was favored more by scholars and elites.
*Hát tuồng (also known as Hát bội): A theatre form strongly influenced by [[Chinese opera]], it transitioned from being entertainment for the royal court to travelling troupes who performed for commoners and peasants, featuring many well-known [[stock characters]].

===Traditional dance===
{{main|Traditional Vietnamese dance}}
Vietnam has 54 different ethnics, each with their own traditional dance.  Among the ethnic Vietnamese majority, there are several traditional dances performed widely at festivals and other special occasions, such as the [[lion dance]].

In the imperial court there also developed throughout the centuries a series of complex court dances which require great skill. Some of the more widely known are the imperial lantern dance, fan dance, and platter dance, among others.

===Water puppetry===
[[File:Thang Long Water Puppet Theatre2.JPG|thumb|Water puppetry theatre in Hanoi]]
[[Water puppetry]] is a distinct Vietnamese art which had its origins in the 12th century. In water puppetry, a split-bamboo screen obscures puppets which stand in water and are manipulated using long poles hidden beneath the water.  Epic storylines are played out with many different characters, often depicting traditional scenes of Vietnamese life.  Despite nearly dying out in the 20th century, it has been saved by efforts of preservation and is now largely seen by tourists to Vietnam.

==Language arts==

===Literature===
{{main|Vietnamese literature}}
'''Vietnamese literature''' is [[literature]], both oral and written, created largely by [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese-speaking]] people, although Francophone Vietnamese and English-speaking Vietnamese authors in Australia and the United States are counted by many critics as part of the national tradition.  For much of its history, Vietnam was dominated by China and as a result much of the written work during this period was in [[Classical Chinese]].  [[Chữ nôm]], created around the 10th century, allowed writers to compose in Vietnamese using modified Chinese characters. Although regarded as inferior to Chinese, it gradually grew in prestige.  It flourished in the 18th century when many notable Vietnamese writers and poets composed their works in ''chữ nôm'' and when it briefly became the official written script.  While the [[quốc ngữ]] script was created in the 17th century, it did not become popular outside of missionary groups until the early 20th century, when the French colonial administration mandated its use in [[French Indochina]].  By the mid-20th century, virtually all Vietnamese works of literature were composed in ''quốc ngữ''.

Some defining works of literature include ''[[The Tale of Kieu]]'' by [[Nguyễn Du]], and ''[[Lục Vân Tiên]]'' by [[Nguyễn Đình Chiểu]].

===Poetry===
Poet [[Hồ Xuân Hương]] (born during the end of the 18th century) composed much of her poetry in [[Chữ Nôm]], and most of it has been translated into [[quốc ngữ]] for modern Vietnamese.  Her poetry continues to be widely popular.  Other poets such as the famous [[Mandarin (bureaucrat)|Mandarin official]] [[Duong Khue]] had some of his poetry adapted into songs that are still famous today, such as the [[Ca trù]]-genre song "Hồng hồng, tuyết tuyết".

Many Vietnamese poems, along with folk "literature" in general, tends to be much more of an oral tradition - as literacy (as it is defined today) in the past was restricted mostly to scholars and the elite.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28683">'''Vision Forum''' is an organisation that carries out research in contemporary art and organises events that transgresses the boundaries between [[performance art|performance]], exhibition, [[workshop]]s and [[education]]. It grew from a series of events organised by [[Curatorial Mutiny]] in collaboration with KSM&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isak.liu.se/ksm KSM website (in Swedish)]&lt;/ref&gt; at Campus [[Norrköping]], [[Linköpings Universitet]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.liu.se/?l=en University website]&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Sweden]] 2005-2007. Vision Forum took its present form in 2008. It does not have a physical location or a program, but responds to the needs of the group of artists, curators and researchers that are part of the network at any given moment. Its members are mostly based in [[Europe]] and have carried out projects all over the continent, in North America, Australia and Asia. In 2009, neuroscientist [https://stephenwhitmarsh.com Stephen Whitmarsh] joined the group, showing that the organisation can host members outside of the artistic community. A strategy that has been developed further in  subsequent years.&lt;ref name="Now 2012"&gt;Time Capsules and Conditions of Now, Edited by Fatos Ustek, David Roberts Art Foundation, London, UK and Vision Forum 2012, {{ISBN|978-91-978934-6-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Workshops and Public Presentations==
[[File:Yzf1low.jpg|thumb|right|Yang Zhifei's performance in Beijing that was part of The Invisible Generation, October 2009.]]

In 2008-09, Vision Forum organised two major projects. (Anti)Realism&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.visionforum.eu/2008antirealism.html Documentation of workshop and exhibitions]&lt;/ref&gt; brought together young contemporary visual artists based in Sweden, China, Great Britain, the Netherlands and France.&lt;ref name="Youth, Youth p. 120-121"&gt;Youth, Youth, Youth, p. 120-121, Catalogue Produced by Huang Xiaopeng, Guangzhou At Academy, Guangzhou, China, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The first part of the project was a practical workshop that took place in [[Guangzhou]], China, in September 2008. The European participants developed collaborative projects with their Chinese peers that focused on [[time-based art]].

&lt;blockquote&gt;”The title and the [[conceptual framework]] of the workshop (Anti)Realism was created to look into the differences and similarities of how we look at [[reality]] (both as individuals and as members of different cultures) and how that can be used to further our understanding and appreciation of life. The project allowed the participants to both understand differences between European cultures, as well as how these differ from Chinese contemporary art and life.”&lt;ref&gt;(Anti)Realism, Numéro 1, D'Ailleurs, Cold Mountain, France {{ISBN|978-2-9518588-4-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The results of the workshop were presented to the public at Guangzhou Academy of Fine Art and a second were later developed into an exhibition which was shown at Verkstad in Sweden, Ècole Régional de Beaux Arts de Besaçon in France and at Adele C in Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Youth, Youth, Youth, p. 87, Catalogue Produced by Huang Xiaopeng, Guangzhou At Academy, Guangzhou, China, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Parallel to (Anti)Realism Vision Forum created four workshops in [[Rome]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.visionforum.eu/rome.html Documentation of workshop organised by Formazero]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Zürich]],&lt;ref&gt;Curatorial workshop in Zürich organised by White Space and other local players.[http://www.visionforum.eu/zurich.html]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Amsterdam]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.visionforum.eu/amsterdam.html Utopia workshop in Amsterdam]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Stockholm]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.visionforum.eu/stockholm.html The Stockholm syndrom organised by Good TV at Konsthögskolan Stockholm]&lt;/ref&gt; These involved a completely different group of artists and curators from (Anti)Realism and focused on [[architecture]], artistic production, [[curator|curation]] and [[presentation]] respectively.

==The Development of Nodes==
[[File:Dinu.li.low.jpg|thumb|right| Video stills of Dinu Li's performance on the Shenzhen Metro that was part of The Invisible Generation, November 2009.]]

In 2009-10, Vision Forum focused on four major projects or “[[wikt:node|node]]s”. They were each made up of a number of artists and curators who, like the Vision Forum workshops in 2008-09 met regularly. The nodes were held together by all doing research on [[time]] and [[temporality]] in different ways. “If you don’t want God, you’d better have a multiverse” was curated and developed by [[1:1 Projects]] in Rome.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.visionforum.eu/rome.html Blog devoted to the project]&lt;/ref&gt; The project was focused on workshops in Rome, [[Skopje]] and [[Paris]]. At the last meeting, the participants reformulated themselves into “OuUnPo” (Workshop for Alternative Universes), inspired by French literary group [[Oulipo]]. The participants organised a public event at [[Museum of Contemporary Art of Rome|MACRO]] in Rome and at [[Tate Britain]] in [[London]] &lt;ref&gt;Yane Calovski, Obj'ct, Ed. Basak Senova, Ponder Pause Process (a situation), p. 90-97, Zorlu Center Art Collection, Istanbul, Turkey {{ISBN|978-605-63320-0-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; in spring 2010 under the new name. Ouunpo has since then carried out events in [[Porto]], [[Athens]], [[Belgrade]], [[Amsterdam]]-[[Nijmegen]], [[Stockholm]]-[[Norrköping]]&lt;ref&gt;Music for Works, Takahashi and Miliani, Jacopo Miliani - Do you Believe in Mirages, a+mbookstore edizioni, Milano, 2012. {{ISBN|9788887071429}}.&lt;/ref&gt; in collaboration with art and science institutions like [[Deste Foundation]] and [[Max Planck Institute]]. Australian artist duo [[A Constructed World]] started “Speech and What Archive?” which continued its activities in 2010-13.&lt;ref&gt;[http://speecharchive.blogspot.com/ The project’s official blog]&lt;/ref&gt; The node focused on alternative forms of communication and organised events in Paris, [[Nice]], [[San Francisco]] and [[Melbourne]] working with art institutions like [[Villa Arson]] and [[California College of the Arts|CCA]]. Curator Claire Louise Staunton carried out research which later lead to the creation of the temporary gallery “Inheritance Shenzhen”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artforum.com/archive/id=24421 Article in Artforum picks by Robin Peckham]&lt;/ref&gt; in the Chinese region of [[Guangdong]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://inheritanceprojects.org/inh-sz/ Documentation of the Gallery’s activities December 2009 – April 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; This project was developed in Milton Keynes in 2011 with a large exhibition, seminar and publication.&lt;ref name="mkgallery.org"&gt;http://www.mkgallery.org/education/projectspace/community_without_propinquity/&lt;/ref&gt; They then travelled to [[Chandigar]] and as an outcome of this research the node presented an exhibition about British architect [[Jane Drew]] and the artistic work that flourished around her at the [[Institute of Contemporary Arts|Institute of Contemporary Art]] in London in 2014.

==The Invisible Generation==
{{Main|The Invisible Generation|l1= The Invisible Generation}}

[[File:Huttner.hitler.melbourne.jpg|thumb|left| Installation view of poster project “Young Dictators” (Hitler as child), by Per Hüttner at public location in Melbourne, September 2009.]]

The fourth major project realized in 2009-10 was [[The Invisible Generation]].&lt;ref&gt;The Invisible Generation, published by Vision Forum, Stockholm, Sweden, 2010. {{ISBN|978-91-978934-2-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was conceived by artist [[Per Hüttner]] and Curator [[Daniele Balit]] and created new meeting places between art and its audiences. A great number of projects were realized in [[Melbourne]], [[Shenzhen]], [[Beijing]] and [[Kiev]] in 2009-2010. For each city the program and artist list was totally new. No, project was ever repeated twice. The project always allowed the audience to meet art in new and unexpected situations and played with or confused the audiences’ expectations about what art is, where it normally appears and what shape it should take. In the introduction to the project in the catalogue Gerrie van Noord writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt; “The Invisible Generation is a collection of artistic interventions that spread virally across the continents of our globe. It used the artistic and curatorial network of Vision Forum as a platform to multiply and make its way into the perception of people in unexpected spaces of selected cities around the world. The project takes its starting point in performative traditions, but focuses on practices and events that cross over into other time-based activities such as sound, film, video, literature, theatre and workshops and draws inspiration from other related fields such as journalism, fashion and design, but also from those further removed like mathematics and physics”&lt;ref&gt;Gerrie van Noord, p.8 The Invisible Generation catalogue, published by Vision Forum, Stockholm, Sweden, 2010. {{ISBN|978-91-978934-2-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Redefining Communication==
Since September 2011 Vision Forum organizes two international workshops a year in [[Östergötland]] in Sweden. These bring together members of the different international nodes (in 2012 Vision Forum ran 10 nodes) and interact with local institutions and art organizations. This means that the research carried out in the individual nodes have started cross referencing and exchanging methodology between each other. Vision Forum, through its structure, develops modes of [[communication]] and knowledge production that make use of current technology. The nodes of the network also allow a deeper dialogue with their audiences that, in their turn, are inscribed into in numerous interconnected networks.&lt;ref name="OuUnPo 2013"&gt;OuUnPo[RTO], edited by Claudia Squitieri and Samon Takahashi, texts by OuUnPo, designed by Åbäke published by Dent-de-Leone and Vision Forum, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; It has become increasingly clear that the network focuses on research about how art uses, retains, distributes and develops knowledge along with how this can be fed back into the everyday lives of art's audience.&lt;ref&gt;[[The Invisible Generation]], Gerrie van Noord, 2011, published by Curatorial Mutiny and Vision Forum, Sweden. {{ISBN|978-91-978934-2-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; This ties in with Vision Forum's founder Per Hüttner's work that can be exemplified by projects like [[I am a Curator]]”,&lt;ref name="Introdictionary"&gt;{{cite book

This idea of exchange is based on co-producing knowledge with the collaborating institutions and audiences, rather than a top down knowledge distribution. The strategy that they call "collapsing the global with the local" is currently being developed by the network in collaboration with [[Global Art and the Museum]] at [[ZKM]] in Karlsruhe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://globalartmuseum.de/site/guest_author/323 OuUnPo and Globalisation on Global Art and the Museum website]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Residency and Interdisciplinary Activities==
In 2011 Vision Forum started publishing books and catalogues regularly to document its activities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://vfpublications.blogspot.de/ The Organisations website for publications]&lt;/ref&gt; The organisation also started to produce experimental films in a separate node called Vision Forum Film. Two films were in Production in 2012: "Effektivia" directed by [[Jesper Frilund]] and [[Marcus Fernstad]] and "The River" by Sino-Swedish director Ting Ting Yang (杨婷婷).&lt;ref&gt;Vision Forum Film, edited by Rudi Heinrichsen, translated by Yan Rong and designed by Erik Månsson. Texts by Rudi Heinrichsen, Per Hüttner, Yang Tingting, Jesper Frilund and Rebbecca Catching. published by Vision Forum, 2013. {{ISBN|978-91-978934-8-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2013 Vision Forum opened an international residency program called "Norrköping Air.&lt;ref&gt;David Isaksson, Norrköpings Tidningar, p. B2-3, 20 July 2013&lt;/ref&gt;" The program was initiated in collaboration with KSM at [[Linköpings universitet]], [[IASPIS]] and offers three artists the opportunity to work in parallel [[Sweden]] for 3 months during the Swedish summer months. The project focuses on experimental art in public spaces, drawing inspiration from the [[Invisible Generation]] and similar projects and was developed in close dialogue with the centenary of Norrköping Art Museum.&lt;ref&gt;http://norrkopingair.blogspot.ch/&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6130">In [[Carl Jung]]'s theory of [[analytical psychology]], the '''Wise Old Woman and the [[Wise Old Man]]''' are [[archetypes]] of the [[Collective Unconscious]]. 'The "wise old woman"...[or] helpful "old woman" is a well-known symbol in myths and fairy tales for the wisdom of the eternal female nature'.&lt;ref&gt;Jolande Jacobi, "Symbols in an Individual Analysis" in C. G . Jung ed., ''Man and his Symbols'' (London 1978) p. 331 and p. 335&lt;/ref&gt; The 'Wise Old Man, or some other very powerful aspect of eternal masculinity'&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Hannah, ''Striving towards Wholeness'' (Boston 1988) p. 291&lt;/ref&gt; is her male counterpart.

==Individuation==

In Jung's thought, the [[individuation]] process was marked by a sequence of archetypes, each acquiring predominance at successive stages, and so reflecting what he termed an ascending psychic scale or 'hierarchy of the unconscious'.&lt;ref&gt;C. G. Jung, ''Two Essays on Analytical Psychology'' (London 1953) p. 226&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, starting with the intermediate position of '[[Anima and animus|anima or animus]]...just as the latter have a higher position in the hierarchy than the [[Shadow (psychology)|shadow]], so wholeness lays claim to a position and a value superior'&lt;ref&gt;C. G. Jung, ''Aion'' (London 1959) p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; still. The Wise Old Woman and Man, as what he termed "[[Mana]]" personalities or "supraordinate" personalities, stood for that wholeness of the self: 'the ''mother'' ("Primordial Mother" and "[[Earth Mother]]") as a supraordinary personality...as the "self"'.&lt;ref&gt;C. G. Jung, ''The Archetypes and the Collective Unconscious'' (London 1996) p. 183 and p. 187&lt;/ref&gt;

As [[Marie-Louise von Franz|von Franz]] put it, 'If an individual has wrestled seriously and long enough with the anima (or animus) problem, so that he, or she, is no longer partially identified with it, the unconscious again changes its dominant character and appears in a new symbolic form representing the Self, the innermost nucleus of the personality. In the dreams of a woman this centre is usually personified as a superior female figure – a priestess, sorceress, earth mother, or goddess of nature or love. In the case of a man, it manifests itself as a masculine initiator and guardian (an Indian ''[[guru]]''), a wise old man, a spirit of nature and so forth'.&lt;ref&gt;M.-L. von Franz, "The Process of Individuation", in C. G. Jung ed., ''Symbols'' p. 207–8&lt;/ref&gt;

The masculine initiator was described by Jung as 'a figure of the same sex corresponding to the father-imago...the mana-personality [a]s a dominant of the collective unconscious, the recognized archetype of the mighty man in the form of hero, chief, magician, medicine-man, saint, the ruler of men and spirits'.&lt;ref&gt;Jung, ''Two Essays'' p. 226-7&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, 'the wise Old Woman figure represented by [[Hecate]] or the [[Crone]] ...the Great Mother'&lt;ref&gt;Claire Douglas, ''The Old Woman's Daughter'' (Texas 2006) p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; stood for an aspect of the mother-imago. The archetypes of the collective unconscious can thus be seen as inner representations of the same-sex parent – as an 'imago built up from parental influences plus the specific reactions of the child'.&lt;ref&gt;Jung, ''Two Essays'' p. 184-5&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, for the Jungian, 'the making conscious of those contents which constitute the archetype of the mana personality signifies therefore "for the man the second and true liberation from the father, for the woman that from the mother, and therewith the first perception of their own unique individuality"'.&lt;ref&gt;Jung, quoted in Jolande Jacobi, ''The Psychology of C. G. Jung: An Introduction'' (London 1946) p. 116&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mana attributes: positive and negative==

In Jung's view, 'all archetypes spontaneously develop favourable and unfavourable, light and dark, good and bad effects'.&lt;ref&gt;Jung, ''Aion'' p. 267&lt;/ref&gt; Thus 'the "good Wise Man" must here be contrasted with a correspondingly dark, chthonic figure',&lt;ref&gt;Jung, ''Aion'' p. 229&lt;/ref&gt; and in the same way, the priestess or sibyl has her counterpart in the figure of 'the witch...called by Jung the "terrible mother"'.&lt;ref&gt;Northrop Frye, ''Anatomy of Criticism'' (Princeton 1971) p. 196&lt;/ref&gt; Taken together, male and female, 'The hunter or old magician and the witch correspond to the negative parental images in the magic world of the unconscious'.&lt;ref&gt;Jung, ''Archetypes'' p. 235&lt;/ref&gt; 

But judgement of such collective archetypes must not be hasty. 'Just as all archetypes have a positive, favourable, bright side that points upwards, so also they have one that points downwards, partly negative and unfavourable, partly chthonic' – so that (for example) 'the sky-woman is the positive, the bear the negative aspect of the "supraordinate personality", which extends the conscious human being upwards into the celestial and downwards into the animal regions'.&lt;ref&gt;Jung, ''Archetypes'' p. 226 and p. 195&lt;/ref&gt; Yet both aspects, celestial and chthonic, were (at least potentially) of equal value for Jung, as he sought for what he termed a "coniunctio oppositorum", a union of opposites.  'One does not become enlightened by imagining figures of light', he argued, 'but by making the darkness conscious'.&lt;ref&gt;C. G. Jung, ''[[Alchemical Studies]]'' (London 1978) p. 265-6&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly with respect to the goal of the individuation process itself, 'as a totality, the self is a coincidentia oppositorum; it is therefore bright and dark and yet neither'.&lt;ref&gt;C. G. Jung, ''Mysterium Coniunctionis'' (London 1963) p. 108n&lt;/ref&gt;

Coming to terms with the Mana figures of the collective unconscious – with the parental imagos – thus meant overcoming a psychic [[splitting (psychology)|splitting]], so as to make possible an acceptance of 'the Twisted side of the Great Mother'; an acceptance of the way 'the father contains both Kings at once...the Twisted King and the Whole King'.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Bly, ''Iron John'' (Dorset 1991) p. 115 and p. 113&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''' ''xenia'' motif''' in Roman [[mosaic]] is a [[still life]] [[motif (visual arts)|motif]] consisting of a grouping of various items, mostly edible, representing a generous offering (a ''xenia'') from a wealthy host to his guests.  The items are often spread across different compartments in floor mosaic schemes. No doubt there were once paintings, but these have been lost.

Typical elements of a ''xenia'' motif include game hanging from hooks, fish, baskets of fruit (often overturned), and the like. [[Vitruvius]] lists specifically "poultry, eggs, vegetables, and other country produce".&lt;ref&gt;''[[de Architectura]]'', [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Vitruvius/6*.html#7.4 VI:7:4]&lt;/ref&gt;

''Xenia'' motifs are typically found in reception rooms.

[[Xenia (Greek)|The word ''xenia'']] is Greek, and means 'hospitality'; in Latin, it came to mean presents for guests, and later presents in general. It also came to include a class of [[epigram]]matic inscription attached to the presents, [[xenia epigram]]s.
